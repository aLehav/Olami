‘U’ has contracted 
outside search firm, 
appointed selection 

committee

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Michigan 
interim 
Athletic 

Director Jim Hackett describes 
his tenure at the University as a 
love story — one that begins with 
a phone call.

This love story, however, is 

coming to an end. Wednesday, 
Hackett and University President 
Mark Schlissel outlined the ongo-
ing search for someone to fill the 
position on a permanent basis in 
a teleconference with reporters.

Hackett inherited the posi-

tion from Dave Brandon, who 
resigned on Oct. 31, 2014 amid a 
storm of controversy surround-
ing Michigan quarterback Shane 
Morris’ mishandled concussion, 
increasing student ticket prices 
and reports of e-mails to dis-

gruntled fans deemed by many 
to be inappropriate, among other 
factors.

“It 
began 
with 
President 

Schlissel calling and asking if I 
could help,” Hackett said. “I have 
another friend in business who 
said sometimes you do things for 
God and country. I love the Uni-
versity, and I felt compelled to 
come and help.”

Hackett and Schlissel had dis-

cussed taking steps toward find-
ing an athletic director earlier in 
the year, but decided it was best to 
wait until the end of the Michigan 
football team’s regular season.

With the regular season over, 

the search is ongoing, and will 
be facilitated by a committee 
chaired by Schlissel. The six 
members of the committee are 
Liz Barry, Schlissel’s special 
counsel; Michigan softball coach 
Carol Hutchins; women’s soc-
cer player Corinne Harris; Kevin 
Hegarty, the University’s chief 
financial officer; faculty athletic 
representative Anne Curzan; and 
Dr. Stefan G. Humphries, a for-

ADMINISTRATION

Almost 60 students 
gather on Diag to 
rally behind the 

organization

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

After a gunman opened fire 

in the parking lot outside of a 

Colorado Springs Planned Par-
enthood on Nov. 27, killing three 
people, students gathered on the 
Diag on Wednesday night to hold 
a vigil in memory of the victims.

LSA senior Miriam Dow, co-

president of the University chap-
ter of Students for Choice, said 
the news of the attack was jar-
ring, but not entirely surprising.

Law 
enforcement 
officials 

believe the shooter’s anti-abor-
tion views lead him to target the 
Planned Parenthood clinic. Some 

politicians and activists have 
argued the violence was spurred 
by the tone of anti-abortion 
rhetoric, particularly in light of 
the release of videos purporting 
to show a representative from 
Planned Parenthood negotiat-
ing the sale of fetal tissue, which 
Planned Parenthood President 
Cecile Richards has denied.

“It’s finally happened; the 

huge act of violence that we were 
expecting with all of this hate 
rhetoric being thrown around,” 

she said. “It’s horrible to think 
that somebody would go to that 
extreme.”

Nearly 60 people attended 

Wednesday’s vigil, which was 
also designed to stand in soli-
darity with the employees and 
patients of Planned Parenthood, 
as well as in support of wom-
en’s reproductive rights, which 
attendees said Planned Parent-
hood aims to protect.

D.J. Durkin led 
resurgence for 

Wolverines’ stellar 

defense in 2015

By JAKE LOURIM
Managing Sports Editor

The leader of the Michigan 

football team’s vaunted defense is 
changing schools.

Maryland announced Wednes-

day that Michigan defensive coor-
dinator D.J. Durkin will become its 
36th head football coach, and will 
be officially introduced Thurs-
day morning. The news was first 
reported by Sports Illustrated.

Rumors that Durkin would 

leave for College Park began as 
early as last week. Yahoo! Sports 
reported Nov. 25 that he had 
already interviewed for the job, 
though Durkin would not com-
ment on those rumors during his 
press conference later that day. 
The Terrapins fired coach Randy 
Edsall on Oct. 11, eight days after 
losing to Michigan, 28-0. Mary-
land finished 2-10 this season (0-8 
in the Big Ten).

Durkin helped lead the Wol-

verines’ resurgence this season, 
coaching a defense that finished 
fourth in the country in total yards 
allowed and 17th in points allowed. 
For a good part of the season, how-
ever, Michigan was ranked No. 1 in 
both categories.

A streak of three straight shut-

outs in the first half of the year 
vaulted the unit to the top of 
the rankings before a slump in 
November knocked the Wolver-
ines down a few spots. Michigan 
gave up 41 points in a double-
overtime win at Indiana on Nov. 
14 and 42 more in a loss to Ohio 
State on Saturday.

Durkin has just over a month 

of head coaching experience. He 
served as defensive coordinator 
at Florida for the 2014 season, 
and the Gators fired head coach 
Will Muschamp at the end of 
the season. Durkin led the team 
during its bowl practices and in 
a 28-20 win over East Carolina 
in the Birmingham Bowl before 
accepting the defensive coordi-
nator job at Michigan.

Durkin will return to Ann 

Arbor on Nov. 5, 2016, when 
Maryland plays the Wolverines 
at Michigan Stadium.

Panelist Arshan Ahmad speaks at the Ask a Muslim event at Munger Graduate residence on Wednesday.

Students aim to 
address portrayal 
of Islam after ISIS 

attacks in Paris

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

About 50 graduate students 

gathered in Munger Gradu-
ate Residences on Wednesday 
evening to listen to three Mus-

lim University students discuss 
their faith and experiences after 
the series of terrorist attacks in 
Paris carried out by ISIS.

Attendees gathered to learn 

more about the panelists’ beliefs 
and perceptions of the Muslim 
religion. Public Health student 
Ojaswi 
Adhikari 
explained 

the importance of these kind 
of events in promoting under-
standing and awareness. She 
said many people hesitate to ask 
certain questions out of fear of 
offending their peers.

“I hope that people are able 

to ask whatever they want to 
ask and have an open space 
where they don’t feel as judged,” 
Adhikari said. “It’s important to 
open up that dialogue and to feel 
free to say whatever you want to 
because you’re not going to have 
a platform like this outside of 
here.”

Many students attended with 

the intention to learn more about 
Islam in general. Public Health 
student Erica Dancik said she

Faculty, students 
contribute to report 

on increasing 

advanced degrees

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

With the help of University 

students and faculty, a group 
of state legislators released 
a set of recommendations on 
Tuesday aiming to increase 
the number of Michigan resi-
dents 
with 
post-secondary 

degrees over the next 10 years.

The report, titled Reaching 

for Opportunity, was compiled 
by several Michigan colleges 
including the University, as 
well as bipartisan group of 
legislative leaders and various 
other organizations. The rec-
ommendations outline paths 
to increasing the percentage of 
Michigan individuals pursue 
higher education and obtain 
associate 
degrees, 
techni-

cal certificates or any other 
advanced degree.

Study links dopamine levels 
with learning, motivation

#GrowBlue raises more than 
$117,000 for cancer research

Signals assist in 

evaluating benefits, 
downsides of action

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporter

Students can sometimes lose 

motivation heading into final 
exams, and the answer as to why 
may lie with dopamine, accord-
ing to University researchers.

Psychology 
Prof. 
Joshua 

Berke, one of the study’s authors, 
and Arif Hamid, a neurosci-
ence doctoral student and lead 
author of the study, point to a link 
between dopamine, a reward 
chemical in the brain, and learn-
ing and motivation.

The study found that dopa-

mine levels in the brain com-
municate the value of particular 
tasks. Berke said these value sig-
nals then allows people to deter-
mine how much effort they 
should put toward a goal. Those 
judgements are based on an eval-
uation of the potential rewards 

from completing the task and the 
consequences of either avoiding 
the test or failing to complete it 
successfully. If dopamine lev-
els communicate that a task is 
worthwhile, the individual will 
likely feel more motivated to 
tackle it.

“You’re less likely to be dis-

tracted because this activity that 
you’re engaged in is considered 
to be more worthwhile,” he said. 
“That is not previously accounted 
for by our theories of dopamine 
function, and now it is.”

The research was conducted 

by measuring dopamine levels 
in rats. The rats were observed 
while they performed decision-
making tasks, like choosing a 
door, then rewarded for choos-
ing the correct door. When the 
rats had been rewarded, they 
began to decide faster, indicat-
ing increased motivation. They 
also were more likely to choose 
the option that had previ-
ously rewarded them, showing 
increased learning.

Elevated 
dopamine 
levels 

corresponded with both moti-

vation and learning in the rats. 
This finding is novel. Previ-
ously, researchers considered 
it counterintuitive that a neu-
rotransmitter such as dopamine 
could achieve both motivating 
and learning functions. In other 
words, dopamine could contrib-
ute either to motivation or to 
learning, but not to both.

Though 
many 
researchers 

have attempted to resolve this 
dynamic, Berke said this new 
study represents a major stride 
toward doing just that.

“All the theoretical ideas had 

been about learning, but so much 
of the observations about how 
drugs affect people and so forth 
have really been about motiva-
tion and not about learning,” 
Berke said.

Additionally, the team looked 

at the effect of artificially spik-
ing dopamine levels in rats. They 
found that this spike also corre-
lated with increased motivation 
and learning.

Hamid said this finding has 

implications 
in 
humans,

Month-long MRelay 
initiative puts new 
spin on “No Shave 

November” campaign

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Last month, many University 

students opted to let their beards 
grow for “No-Shave November” 
— an effort designed to raise 
awareness and lend support to 
cancer patients and survivors.

Drawing inspiration from this, 

MRelay — the University’s chap-
ter of the organization Relay for 
Life, which raises research fund-
ing through the American Cancer 
Society — spearheaded #Grow-
Blue, a month-long initiative. 
With the campaign completed, 
the student organization raised 
more than more than $117,000 in 
donations.

As part of the initiative, 

MRelay members encouraged 
male students to grow their 
facial hair and female students 
to wear blue ribbons and hair 
extensions in solidarity with 
cancer patients who lose their 
hair during treatment.

Public Policy senior Rebecca 

Hart, who serves on MRelay’s 
senior leadership team, said the 
campaign was initially concep-
tualized in 2014 as an offshoot 
of #NoShaveNovember.

Hart said the initial cam-

paign only called for male stu-
dent participation, but MRelay 
has since expanded the program 
to promote female involvement 
as well.

“We had — as a campus — 

come together, (with) this great 
community effort, and we got 
girls involved this year,” she 
said. “I think that’s the first 
time that’s been done anywhere, 
so we’re really proud of that.”

LSA junior Kelly O’Donnel, 

a member of the MRelay senior 
leadership team, said the team 

created #GrowBlue to connect 
the national movement to the 
University community.

“We 
created 
our 
own 

hashtags, 
#GrowBlue 
and 

#BePurple, because MRelay’s 
color is purple,” she said. “We 
wanted to make it ‘GrowBlue’ to 
make it specific to the Univer-
sity of Michigan campus, but we 
also wanted to tie it back to our 
mission and what we’re really 
going for.”

The MRelay leadership team 

encouraged students to post 
pictures of themselves on social 
media 
using 
#GrowBlue 
to 

encourage friends and family 
to make donations to the cause, 
which would in turn go to the 
American Cancer Society.

O’Donnel 
said 
students 

accrued several hundred tweets 
after the initiative launched.

“We had hundreds of people 

using these hashtags that we 
could then search and repost 
and share people’s stories (and) 
stories about their friends who 
have been affected by cancer 
and their family members, and 
why they’re doing it,” she said. 
“It was impactful to see so many 
people engaged with the cam-
paign.”

O’Donnel said it was inspir-

ing to see the Delta Chi fra-
ternity rally in support of a 
brother and MRelay participant 
who had recently been diag-
nosed with cancer.

“His entire fraternity rallied 

around him to get involved,” 
she said. “I just got a notifica-
tion today that they’re branding 
all this apparel that they want 
the MRelay community to send 
out to support him. More so 
than just the fundraising, we’re 
really about being a community 
for people, and being that con-
nection to survivors and other 
people that have been affected.”

In addition to planning for 

their 24-hour campus aware-
ness relay event in April 2016, 
Hart and O’Donnel said MRelay 
will host a benefit concert Jan. 
25 at the Lydia Mendelssohn 
Theatre.

COUR SE EVALUATIONS

mer Michigan football player and 
the current medical director at 
Renown Rehabilitation Center in 
Reno, Nevada.

Schlissel, whose experience as 

provost at Brown University gave 
him little prior experience in deal-
ing with big-time college athletics, 
acknowledged the stakes are high.

“I have to believe this is the best 

athletic director position in the 
county,” Schlissel said.

Hackett and Schlissel both 

stressed the importance of the 
former’s willingness to continue 
on an interim basis indefinitely. 
They said this will prevent the job 
process from becoming rushed 
and allow the University to be 
confident in its decision when one 
is eventually reached.

Schlissel said community out-

reach has already begun, and that 
input from coaches won’t be lim-
ited to Hutchins.

The University’s last three ath-

letic directors — Hackett, Brandon 
and Bill Martin, who served from 
2001 to 2010 — boasted impres-

sive corporate résumés prior to 
running the Athletic Department. 
Schlissel, however, said candi-
dates will not necessarily be lim-
ited to those who come directly 
from the business world.

“I’m looking for the best person 

for the job,” Schlissel said. “It is a 
$151-million enterprise. It’s a com-
plex enterprise that requires some-
body with business accounting and 
leadership skills and experience.”

Experience in athletics and 

an understanding of how college 
athletic departments function is 
another obvious criterion, Schlis-
sel said.

“The bottom line is we’re going 

to hire a spectacular person,” he 
said. 

Hiring a “Michigan Man” — a 

term Hackett said he wanted to 
do away with at his introductory 
press conference — is also not a 
necessity, according to Schlissel.

“I wouldn’t limit us to only 

looking at people who have had 
Michigan stories or connections,” 
Schlissel said. He acknowledged, 
however, that those with Univer-
sity ties will have an advantage in 
the selection process.

Hackett’s 13 months at the helm 

have proved favorable for Michi-
gan fans. His most noteworthy 
accomplishments include signing 
Michigan football coach Jim Har-
baugh to a seven-year contract in 
Dec. 2014, agreeing to terms on a 
$169 million apparel contract with 
Nike in July 2015 and penning an 
open letter to Michigan football 
fans in the wake of the Wolver-
ines’ last-second loss to Michigan 
State on Oct. 17.

Harbaugh, of course, has been 

a smash hit with Michigan fans. 
After a 5-7 finish in 2014, the Wol-
verines finished the 2015 regular 
season with a 9-3 record and are 
currently awaiting an invitation 
to a bowl game.

“There was clearly a hue and 

cry for our candidate that we got,” 
Hackett said of Harbaugh’s hiring 
and the football program’s subse-
quent turnaround. “After I look 
back at all that after a year, what 
I’m kind of mesmerized by is the 
amount of work Jim got done in a 
short amount of time, from hiring 
a staff to transitioning a fifth-year 
quarterback to putting together a 
very competitive team.”

Currently, 
46 
percent 
of 

Michigan’s working population 
holds a post-secondary degree. 
Reaching for Opportunity aims 
to increase the number of post-
secondary degree or credential 
holders to 60 percent by 2025.

Daniel Hurley, chief execu-

tive officer of the Michigan 
Association of State Universi-
ties, said the report aims to 
increase the economic viability 
of the state to meet the increas-
ing demand for skilled labor.

“This is a report that is ulti-

mately about ensuring future 
economic prosperity in Michi-
gan,” Hurley said. “From the 
individual citizen standpoint 
and from a collective state-
wide standpoint, higher educa-
tional levels translate to higher 
incomes.”

Rackham student Jonathan 

McNaughtan, who helped com-
plete research for the project, 
said one of the key takeaways 
from conducting the research 
was the importance of second-
ary education.

“We know that higher edu-

cation matters,” he said. “It 
decreases the poverty rate. Edu-
cation is associated with being 
more healthy. Education is asso-
ciated with being less likely to 
be laid off, and it’s also obviously 
associated with higher income.” 
 

McNaughtan said the study 

also found that Michigan has 

more progress to make before it 
becomes a top-performing state 
when it comes to educational 
attainment.

“It is not impossible, but 

there is still a lot that needs to 
be done,” he said.

The report lays out several 

policy 
recommendations 
for 

reaching the 60 percent goal, 
many of which are rooted in 
creating an environment in the 
state that will allow more people 
to attend post-secondary insti-
tutions and complete degrees. 
Proposals 
include 
exposing 

middle and high school students 
to post-secondary institutions 
early on, ensuring high school 
counselors 
are 
adequately 

prepared to provide college 
counseling and streamlining 
financial aid programs.

Hurley 
emphasized 
the 

importance of bolstering finan-
cial aid, noting that Michigan 
falls in the bottom 10 states for 
need-based scholarship fund-
ing.

“If I had to identify one point 

as most important, it would be 
the call for a simplified, con-
solidated 
and 
significantly 

enhanced need-based financial 
aid program,” Hurley said. “We 
are 41st in the country in terms 
of funding and I think that that 
initiative alone will greatly help 
college access.”

State Rep. Sam Singh (D–East 

Lansing), who worked on the 
report, said it serves as a start-
ing point for further develop-
ment and collaboration.

“If we are going to be a top 

state in economic growth then 
we have to start investing more 
in our education systems,” he 
said. “This report was a hope to 
kind of kick start the conversa-
tion and move us into a faster 
gear for change.”

When considering how the 

recommendations will affect 
institutions like the Univer-
sity, Singh said the report is an 
opportunity 
for 
cooperation 

between educational institu-
tions, 
such 
as 
universities, 

community colleges and K-12 
schools.

“All these institutions will 

have to look at how to coordi-
nate better among themselves 
and also work with their local 
community colleges and K-12 
systems,” Singh said. “It’s an 
opportunity for us to help shape 
the upcoming workforce of the 
state. This report is a roadmap 
that will connect the higher 
education institutions and the 
private sector.”

McNaughtan said the report 

is targeted at the University as 
well.

“I really look at this as a call 

to action for the University of 
Michigan,” McNaughtan said. 
“We are looking at how the 
University is going to react, 
and how it will take the already 
great things that it is doing and 
use this report to guide those 
discussions and initiatives.”

has several Muslim friends and 
classmates and that she came 
to the event to understand their 
experiences on campus.

“I hope that people take away 

a different understanding of their 
peers and their colleagues and a 
greater appreciation for different 
backgrounds and cultures,” Dan-
cik said.

However, she acknowledged 

that while she values such events, 
attendees are typically the ones 
who are already open-minded.

“You risk attracting people that 

are already interested in differ-
ent cultures and backgrounds and 
beliefs, but I’m not sure that mat-
ters,” Dancik said. “It’s still a good 
thing.”

The first question from the 

audience asked what Islam meant 
to the panelists. All three agreed 
the religion is a way of life.

“It’s easy to look at religion as a 

set of repetitive rules and bound-
aries, but for a lot of us, it’s just a 
way of living,” Dentistry student 
Hussain Haider said. “It’s just how 
I can go through this world with 
good, moral standards.”

Business 
graduate 
student 

Arshan Ahmad said the word 
Islam literally means submission 
through peace. He explained that 
the religion is built on the founda-
tion of peace.

“That’s what the religion is 

about,” Ahmad said. “It’s about 
peace, and it’s about love.”

After discussing the five pillars 

of Islam and religious practices 

associated with the faith, audience 
members began asking questions 
centered around the current cli-
mate surrounding the religion in 
society and the media.

Another 
audience 
member 

asked what could be done to steer 
people away from media that pro-
motes xenophobic views.

Haider encouraged the use of 

social media for exposure to all 
perspectives.

“If you have a Twitter or a Face-

book, go and diversify your follow-
ing,” Haider said. “Because then 
you’ll get everyone’s opinion. It’s a 
great way to get the feel for what 
people of different backgrounds 
are feeling when these events hap-
pen.”

Another attendee asked about 

the Muslim reactions in the media 
after the Paris attacks, inquir-
ing if there was a general lack of 
response.

Ahmad 
acknowledged 
that 

efforts have been made to con-
demn the attacks and respond to 
the stereotypes and misconcep-
tions, but said it is not shown in the 
media as often.

“I have a friend who’s a lawyer … 

he goes on the news to refute some 
ideas and things, but the topic of 
conversation always changes to 
try and humiliate him,” Ahmad 
said. “We believe that a lot is being 
done, just no one is listening.”

Rackham student Zehra Sid-

diqui said the beliefs of extremist 
groups are different than those of 
the vast majority of Muslims. She 
claimed that Muslims are also vic-
tims of terrorist attacks, and see 
the extremists as enemies.

“You can see that a lot of Mus-

lims were fighting the Taliban and 
Islamic State, from the Kurds to 
the Sunni tribesmen who were dis-
placed and hurt by them,” Siddiqui 
said. “A lot of Muslims have been 
killed by the Islamic State and 
Taliban. They have an end goal 
and a way of thinking that they are 
trying to justify, and they’re using 
Islam to do it.”

While the event fostered dia-

logue and discussion, Ahmad 
encouraged attendees to take 
action and share what they learned 
at the event.

Business graduate student Mac-

Calvin Romain said he valued this 
event as an opportunity to help 
combat negative misconceptions 
about Muslims.

“I can make sure to dissemi-

nate a lot of the information that 
we gained today and help educate 
people, and make sure they feel 
as comfortable as possible having 
these conversations and initiating 
them with people we have around 
us day-to-day,” Romain said.

Siddiqui stressed the impor-

tance of interacting with Muslim 
peers to strengthen understanding 
and cross-cultural relationships. 
She said this will help reduce nega-
tive perceptions and stereotypes.

“Give Muslims a chance, get to 

know them and how they live their 
life,” Siddiqui said. “They are Wol-
verine fans. They are Spartan fans. 
There are people who wear heads-
carves, and there are people who 
don’t wear headscarves. You can 
see a wide range of people, but get 
to know us as people because that’s 
what we are.”

the Northland Family Planning 
Centers — a women’s health clinic 
that also provides abortions — was 
one of two speakers to address the 
vigil. She stressed the dangers of 
allowing an environment in which 
health care providers and Planned 
Parenthood patients feel threat-
ened or unsafe.

“Clinics shouldn’t be fortresses,” 

she said.

LSA junior David Schafer, who 

attended the rally, said he hoped 
to demonstrate the power of 
strength in numbers.

“Powerful messages need to 

be sent to people to say this can’t 
happen anymore,” Schafer said. “I 
think college students are a pow-
erful vehicle through which that 
message can be spread.”

LSA freshman Rene Diaz said 

college students have a significant 
platform with which to demon-
strate their support of Planned 
Parenthood and what it stands for.

“This school is really amaz-

ing at showing that we care and I 
think this act (of violence) shows 
people that this isn’t OK and not 
welcome in our college and in our 
town,” Diaz said.

LSA freshman Joy Boakye 

pointed to what he sees as a com-
mon trend in U.S. culture.

“Shootings have become such 

a part of our culture that I feel like 

people are seeing this more as a 
shooting than seeing the issue 
behind it,” Boakye said. “I was numb 
because I’m so used to hearing about 
shootings. It’s sad that this is the 
normal for my generation.”

LSA senior Connie Gao, co-pres-

ident of SFC, said she was appre-
ciative for the support displayed 
at the rally. Gao said the organiza-
tion will now work on determining 
their next steps in responding to 
last week’s violent shooting.

“I know without a doubt that we 

will continue to educate students 
and put on amazing events,” Gao 
said. “It’s hard not to get burned 
out when terrible things happen, 
but it’s our responsibility to do 
something.”

LSA Student Government 
considers course evaluations

Resolutions call on 
faculty to move up 
timeline for releasing 

class data

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporter

Throughout much of the 

semester, members of Cen-
tral Student Government and 
the University’s Faculty Sen-
ate have debated whether 
students should have access 
to course evaluation data, as 
well as how and when a poten-
tial release should occur. On 
Wednesday, LSA Student Gov-
ernment joined the conversa-
tion by passing a resolution in 
support of the online release 
of student course evaluations.

LSA SG treasurer Patrick 

Mullan-Koufopoulos, an LSA 
sophomore and co-author of 
the resolution, said the reso-
lution shows that students 
want course evaluation data 
released.

The resolution acknowl-

edges the body’s ability to 
obtain course evaluation data 
via Freedom of Information 
Act requests, which members 
of the assembly say they plan 
to use if the release of the 
evaluation results does not 
occur in a timely fashion. Sev-
eral representatives moved to 
strike any mention of FOIA, 
saying it seemed too aggres-
sive, while others considered 
the language necessary.

“We’re sending the mes-

sage we’re willing to go to 
whatever lengths to get the 
data, rather than work with 
them,” said LSA senior Jake 
Dailey, the assembly’s exter-
nal relations officer. “At this 
time I feel like we’re just 
threatening our relationships 
with the faculty. I would 
hate to see this turn anyone 
against us that has previously 
been an ally.”

Dailey said he does not 

want faculty to interpret the 
resolution as a demand.

“What we’re instead trying 

to do is work with them and 
find the solution that makes 
the most sense and not just 
strong-arm them if it doesn’t 
work out,” Dailey said.

The 
University’s 
Senate 

Assembly voted earlier this 
year to support a delay for 
the release of course evalu-
ations after University offi-
cials expressed interest in 
their release by the end of the 
semester. Faculty expressed 
concerns with the repercus-
sions of releasing the data if 
students aren’t given the tools 
to interpret it correctly, as 
well as criticisms of the cur-
rent methods used for con-
ducting the evaluations.

Currently, a committee led 

by James Holloway, vice pro-
vost for digital and engaged 
education, will explore poten-
tial alternatives for conduct-
ing the evaluations and a 
committee of four faculty and 
four students is considering 
the best methods for releas-
ing course evaluation data 
that will be gathered with the 
new instrument. That work is 
expected to wrap up by April, 
allowing the new instrument 
to be implemented by the fall. 
In October, SACUA agree to 
release course evaluation data 
in full to academic advisers by 
January.

At Monday’s meeting of 

SACUA, CSG President Coo-
per Charlton, an LSA senior, 
continued to press faculty to 
move up the timeline for the 
data’s release.

LSA junior Julia Gips, the 

body’s 
academic 
relations 

officer and a co-author of 
the resolution, said the fac-
ulty initially voted to sup-
port a delay in releasing the 
data and noted that it is the 
responsibility of LSA SG to 
take address their constitu-
ent’s concerns.

“We’d 
really 
like 
to 

advocate 
for 
students, 

however 
we’re 
not 
being 

unreasonable,” Gips said. “I 
know that the FOIA scares a 
lot of people.”

Gips said currently stu-

dents can individually employ 
FOIA to gain access to course 
evaluation data, and by pass-
ing the resolution the assem-
bly would simply look into the 
process for their constituents.

Mullan-Koufopoulos 
said 

mentioning FOIA was not a 
threat to the administration, 
but rather a show of strength 
on behalf of LSA SG. Gipps 
said the evaluations would 
ideally be released next fall 
with faculty assistance.

“If the faculty end up let-

ting us down again, then 
we’re going to have to take 
action,” Gips said. “If the fac-
ulty choose to ignore what 
the students want then the 
students should do something 
about it.”

“There is some progress 

being made, but by that same 
merit they’re stagnated right 
now,” said LSA junior Joey 
Hansel. “I do believe that this 
resolution — while it does 
come across as a bit harsh 
with the FOIA — does tell fac-
ulty that not only is Central 
Student Government inter-
ested in this, not only is Rack-
ham 
Student 
Government 

interested in this, but the 
third-largest student govern-
ment on this campus is also 
strongly interested in getting 
this going.”

Ultimately, the lines regard-

ing the FOIA were preserved 
and the resolution passed with 
16 for, three against and three 
abstentions. 

A 
resolution 
was 
also 

brought 
to 
the 
floor 
at 

Wednesday’s meeting in sup-
port of a joint student-faculty 
task force to improve the 
instrument employed to con-
duct teaching evaluation.

Non-traditional needs

The label of non-labels

T

he diversity, equity and 
inclusion effort initiated by 
the University is centered 

around the goal 
to 
create 
an 

environment 
where 
each 

member of the 
community 
can 
thrive 

intellectually, 
personally 
and 

professionally. 
From 
Nov. 
4 

to Nov. 13, the 
University hosted 
the 
Diversity 

Summit, a series of panels, open 
forums and lectures that exposed 
institutional policies and cultural 
stigmas hindering the University’s 
mission to achieve this desired 
environment. 
Though 
people 

representing an array of racial, 
religious, academic, economic and 
physical-ability 
identities 
shared 

their 
experiences, 
one 
small 

community at the University was not 
accounted for in the conversation: 
non-traditional students.

According to a 2002 study by 

the National Center for Education 
Statistics, non-traditional students 
possess at least one of the following 
seven characteristics:

1. Delays enrollment (does not 

enter postsecondary education in 
the same calendar year that he or 
she finished high school)

2. Attends part time for at least 

part of the academic year

3. Works full time (35 hours or 

more per week) while enrolled

4. 
Is 
considered 
financially 

independent 
for 
purposes 
of 

determining 
eligibility 
for 
 

financial aid

5. Has dependents other than 

a spouse (usually children, but 
sometimes others)

6. Is a single parent (either not 

married or married but separated 
and has dependents)

7. Does not have a high school 

diploma (completed high school 
with a GED or other high school 
completion certificate or did not 
finish high school)

There’s 
a 
continuum 
from 

minimally non-traditional to highly 
non-traditional, 
depending 
on 

how many of the characteristics a 
student possesses.

Educational 

attainment 
is 
an 

element of diversity. 
To gain a glimpse 
of the experiences 
of 
non-traditional 

students 
and 

inquire 
about 

inclusive 
efforts 

for that population 
on campus, I spoke with Michael 
Seifert 
and 
Justin 
Villanueva. 

Seifert, 34 years old, is a senior 
majoring 
in 
political 
science. 

Villanueva, 35 years old, is majoring 
in general studies. Both men are non-
traditional undergraduate students 
at the University. Both had a love for 
learning, but didn’t quite realize this 
interest until later in life. 

Trials to traditions
Though both men have achieved 

their goal of enrolling at the 
University, attending school has 
not come without its challenges. 
Transportation, generational gaps 
between students, professors and 
graduate student instructors, and 
schedule conflicts between work and 
class are a few of the trials Seifert and 
Villanueva have had to face.

Seifert 
feels 
he 
could 
have 

received more institutional support 
in learning how to navigate the 
University. He taught himself how 
to maneuver through campus and 
Ann Arbor on his own. Though 

the financial aid office was helpful 
in 
providing 
Seifert 
financial 

assistance, he didn’t know where he 
could find other specific resources 
that would cater to non-traditional or 
transfer students.

“I don’t feel there is a structured 

support system, because I don’t know 
where to go,” Seifert said.

He suggested that a monthly 

or semesterly meeting for non-
traditional students would help.

“I don’t even know who non-

traditional students are. It would 
be nice to have a non-traditional 
student space or center. I don’t 
want to be outcast as a second-class 
student.”

Villanueva feels he has had 

a generous amount of support 
throughout his process.

“The University has been great 

about grant money,” he said. “I feel 
very supported from the faculty. 
Professors will alter their office 
hours sometimes to meet with 
me in the evening 
to 
accommodate 

me and my work 
schedule.”

However, 
he 

suggested that the 
University 
offer 

more 
evening 

classes 
and 

schedule 
family-

oriented events to demonstrate that 
the campus is welcoming to various 
student lifestyles. 

“I would really love it if there 

were a group or organization that 
had an event where students like 
myself, with families, could bring 
our partners and kids to U of M. I 
would love if the University were 
to create more avenues for that,” 
Villanueva said.

Villanueva understands why the 

University may not be focusing its 
efforts on non-traditional students: 
“I can see (the University) is not 
paying attention to people like 
me because there are not many 
students like me … I feel like they 
are not trying to attract students 
like myself. (But) there are so 
many talented people that are 
in my situation that would love 
to come to U of M. There are an 
overwhelming amount of students 
who fit my demographic who are 
going to college, but they are not 
going to U of M. They are going 

to the Phoenixes, 
the Easterns, the 
Oaklands 
and 

the 
Walshes 
of 
 

the world.”

The 
University 

must 
consider 

increasing 
efforts 

toward places for 
non-traditional 

students. An increasing amount of 
young people are attending two-
year 
institutions 
and 
working 

prior to pursuing enrollment in a 
four-year university. The National 
Center 
for 
Education 
Statistic 

report that 38 percent of the 17.6 
million undergraduates enrolled in 
higher education are over the age of 
25, and 25 percent are over the age 
of 30. The proportion of all students 
over age 25 is projected to increase 
by 23 percent by 2019.

Tangible 
solutions 
to 

increasing inclusivity

Michigan-Pursuing Our Dreams, 

a program under the Office of 
Academic Multicultural Initiatives, 
offers the opportunity to create 
connections 
among 
transfer 

and 
non-traditional 
students. 

Currently, Christine Wylie is the 
coordinator for M-POD. The state, 
the University and Washtenaw 
Community College collectively 
fund the program.

Though 
the 
marketing 
for 

M-POD caters to students coming 
from WCC, the program aims to 
attract diversity to the University 
from various outlets by supporting 
academically 
and 
economically 

disadvantaged 
students. 
This 

includes students from non-college 
preparatory high schools, people 
who have been in the workforce 
prior to attending postsecondary 
education, students with families, 
first-generation 
students 
and 

students who come from low-
income 
backgrounds. 
These 

students, though non-traditional, 
have the academic skills to attend 
the 
University, 
and 
M-POD 

provides the support to ensure 
retention and graduation for their 
unique situations.

M-POD 
offers 
one-on-one 

counseling 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
admissions 

process such as navigating the 
Common Application, bi-monthly 
meetings about topics like financial 
aid, student organizations and 

study 
abroad 

options, and events 
that 
encourage 

networking among 
current and former 
transfer 
students. 

Wylie 
hopes 

transfer 
students 

can 
utilize 
all 

that M-POD and 

OAMI offer to make the transition 
 

process smoother.

“When 
students 
feel 
more 

comfortable about a university, 
they are more likely to apply and 
maximize their experience,” Wylie 
said. “We want them to know 
that OAMI is their home away 
 

from home.”

In the context of the University’s 

diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion 

efforts, Wylie noted, “There has 
been some consideration for non-
traditional transfer students, but 
there is much, much more that we 
can do. Even having a dedicated 
space. (I believe) they are working 
on it in LSA. We (OAMI) have the 
space here, and those coming from 
WCC know about it and like it.”

The University is the home 

away 
from 
home 
for 
many 

students, and it’s important that 
the administration is inclusive 
of the various communities that 
exist on campus. Existing means 
of institutional support for non-
traditional 
students 
should 

be 
promoted 
more 
frequently 
 

and intentionally.

Non-traditional 
students, 

like Seifert and Villanueva, have 
important contributions to make to 
the University. Creating a gathering 
space, promoting the accessibility 
of 
institutional 
support 
and 

encouraging a culture that accepts 
and is amenable to differences are 
steps the University can take to better 
include non-traditional students in 
our community. Having a support 
system is important for all students, 
especially non-traditional ones.

“Everything doesn’t happen how 

you expect it. If you are persistent 
and don’t give up, you can still 
achieve success no matter what age. 
I did it. I’m 34 and I will graduate 
in December. Don’t let anybody 
discourage you,” Seifert said. 

Similarly, Villanueva concluded 

our interview by stating, “The one 
thing the University should know 
about me is that I am willing to 
work just as hard as everyone else. 
I just really need the opportunity … 
For other non-traditional students: 
Keep going. Don’t ever stop. Don’t 
ever give up.”

T

he first time I went on a date with a 
girl was during the summer of 2014. 
I prefaced our date with something 

like, “Soo, I’ve only been 
into guys for literally my 
entire life, but recently I’ve 
been feeling like I need to 
‘explore my sexuality’ or 
whatever — please help a 
girl out.”

She agreed to meet me 

later that week. We found 
each other in the Arb, 
awkward bottles of bright 
red “Smartwater” in hand, 
and sat down to get to 
know each other. For me, it 
immediately didn’t feel right. No matter how 
hard I tried, I couldn’t imagine her as anything 
more than a friend. After she nervously smoked 
half a pack of cigarettes in front of me and 
asked where she could buy $500 worth of weed, 
I decided it just wasn’t going to work. I went 
home feeling slightly uncomfortable, and we 
never talked again. I thought, “Yep, I guess I’m 
straight,” and moved on with my life, content 
that I had at least tried.

I spent the next year never 

thinking twice about that day. 
But over time, it swam back 
into my consciousness, and 
that tiny doubt — that tiny 
desire — was all that I could 
think about. I spoke to some 
of my friends about it, letting 
them in on my little secret. 
That I was even considering 
this other side of me had to 
mean something, right? But I was also confused, 
because don’t people just know these things?

Every story I’d heard from non-straight 

friends was that they had “always known,” or 
at least had known way before the summer 
they turned 20. I felt like a fraud, because I 
hadn’t spent my entire life struggling with self-
acceptance, or hiding my true self for years, 
afraid to tell anyone. I couldn’t understand how 
something like this could just suddenly happen 
to me. But I didn’t know who to talk to. The only 
bisexual women I knew were the brave ones at 
the Ann Arbor Poetry Slam who wrote poems 
about feeling invisible.

I figured that this was probably the answer: 

I was bisexual, and for some god-knows-why 
reason, I was just now figuring it out.

The second time I went on a date with a 

girl was last month. I gave her the same run-
down, and she graciously decided to take the 
“straight girl” out. We met at a coffee shop, and 
then made our way to \aut\ Bar — a gay bar in 
Kerrytown. It was fun. We bonded over being 
from California. I showed off my incredible 
dance moves. It was the first time I kissed a 
girl who wasn’t my drunk best friend. It felt 
natural. But it didn’t feel like this awesome, 
life-changing experience. It didn’t feel as if all 
my questions had been answered. There was no 
“Aha! This is what I’ve been missing!” moment. 

Mostly I just felt more confused.

Being a writer, the only way for me to sort 

through my feelings was, naturally, to put 
them into a poem. I performed in the poetry 
slam this past weekend, and exclaimed to 
a room full of strangers that I had finally 
figured it out: I was bisexual! But as the word 
lurched from my mouth, it got tangled in my 
teeth. It felt forced — like a lie. It didn’t feel 
right. It didn’t feel like me.

The next day, almost as if it were coming to 

me in a dream, a single word bubbled to the 
surface of my mind: fluid. I knew I had heard 
of people identifying as “sexually fluid” (and by 
“people” I mean Miley Cyrus), but I had never 
actually known what it meant. After some help 
from Google and an author named Lisa M. 
Diamond, it was as if all of my questions were 
finally, finally answered.

Diamond, who wrote a book called “Sexual 

Fluidity: Understanding Women’s Love and 
Desire,” writes in the first chapter: “Sexual 
fluidity, quite simply, means situation-
dependent flexibility in women’s sexual 
responsiveness. This flexibility makes it 
possible for some women to experience 
desires for either men or women under 

certain 
circumstances, 

regardless of their overall 
sexual orientation … women 
of 
all 
orientations 
may 

experience variation in their 
erotic and affectional feelings 
as they encounter different 
situations, relationships, and 
life stages.”

I read these sentences 

again. And again. A smile 

stretched across my face. These were the 
words I had been looking for for more than a 
year. These were the only words that finally 
made sense. The book goes on to talk about 
women who had been married to men for 15 
years, then suddenly dated women, and then 
went back to dating men.

It wasn’t a new story, after all. I wasn’t alone.
Diamond states that “in general, the degree 

of fluidity in women appears substantially 
greater than in men,” but also, “any 
individual should be capable of experiencing 
desires that run counter to his or her overall 
 

sexual orientation.”

So guys out there, feel free to join the 
 

club, too.

I only read Diamond’s words for the first 

time earlier this week. I’ve had barely any 
time to process it, but to me it doesn’t matter, 
because as soon as I read these words I knew, 
without looking back, I had found my “Aha! 
This is what I’ve been missing!” moment. Now, 
instead of beating myself up about not knowing 
how to label my sexuality, I’m reveling in the 
label of non-labels: fluid.

I am fluid as fuck. And god, that feels right 

to say.

Less loaded language
“N

o more baby parts.”

This comment, attributed by 

a senior law enforcement official 

to Robert L. Dear Jr. — the 
rage-filled man suspected 
to have killed three people 
and injured nine others 
while opening fire on a 
Planned Parenthood clinic 
in Colorado Springs last 
Friday — doesn’t sound all 
that foreign to me. In fact, 
the line could very well be 
narration from the surrep-
titious Planned Parenthood 
“sting” videos released this 
past July by the inaptly 
named Center for Medical 
Progress, an anti-abortion 
group that claimed the footage contained evi-
dence proving Planned Parenthood’s selling of 
“baby parts” for profit.

I’ve 
also 
heard 
the 

phrase “baby parts” on the 
presidential campaign trail 
by some of the nation’s most 
prominent 
politicians 
(and 

political 
wannabes). 
Last 

July, Ted Cruz appealed to 
Christian 
conservatives 
by 

demanding 
that 
Congress 

launch an investigation into 
Planned Parenthood’s “sale 
and transfer of aborted baby 
parts.” And just a few months ago, at the end of 
September, Carly Fiorina condemned Planned 
Parenthood because she believes they “harvest 

(fetuses’) brains and other body parts.” 
Even after Planned Parenthood conclusively 
discredited these claims, she asserted that 
“Planned Parenthood will not and cannot deny 
this because it is happening. It is happening in 
this nation.”

For me, the fact that the words of a mad-

man on a shooting rampage eerily echo lan-
guage used by anti-abortion politicians on 
a national stage is too worrisome to ignore, 
even if authorities have yet to determine the 
gunman’s exact motives.

I’ll admit that abortion is a highly sensitive 

topic. However, opponents often discuss it 
in extreme rhetoric that advances beyond 
blind emotion, evoking false imagery that 
depicts the procedure as utterly horrific 
and murderous. Terms like “baby parts” 
and “harvesting” inextricably tie the worst 
kind of violence imaginable to the medical 
procedure, making abortion dangerously 
taboo. Much of the dialogue surrounding the 

topic is not only inaccurate, 
but also unfair to the women 
who will eventually have 
an abortion in her lifetime, 
and 
infuses 
the 
issue 

with an unnecessary level 
 

of depravity.

To be clear, as provocative 

and disturbing as some of the 
language used by anti-abor-
tion advocates is, none of it has 
called for bloodshed. However, 

the historical prevalence of violent, anti-abor-
tion actions is undeniable. Attacks on abortion 
providers are far from a new phenomenon. The 

Opponents often 
discuss abortion in 

extreme rhetoric that 

advances beyond 

blind emotion.

I am fluid as 
fuck. And god, 
that feels right 

to say. 

It’s important that 
the administration 
is inclusive of the 

various communities 
that exist on campus.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

fatal shooting at Planned Parenthood 
this past Friday was merely the lat-
est event in a long history of bloody 
attacks on doctors and clinics that 
offer abortion services.

According to The New York Times, 

“At least 11 people have been killed 
in attacks on abortion clinics in the 
United States since 1993, including 
the Colorado shootings.” Across the 
nation, opponents of abortion have 
vandalized, burned and bombed the 
clinics and offices where abortion 
doctors work; the doctors them-
selves, their staff members, patients 
and guests have been threatened, 
intimidated and murdered.

Last 
Friday’s 
shootings 
were 

clearly an act of domestic terrorism 
— even Mike Huckabee agrees with 

me on that. However, we must rec-
ognize that the violent ideology that 
was likely at the root of the attack is 
not distant, but wholly homegrown. 
In order to help prevent future acts 
of violence against abortion pro-
viders and their patients, the abor-
tion paradigm must shift away from 
misrepresentations of violence and 
murder. We’ve got to work together 
to normalize the dialogue surround-
ing abortion and discuss the topic 
with far less loaded, provocative and 
frankly inaccurate terms than “har-
vesting” and “baby parts.”

The reality is that a large number 

of women will have an abortion in 
their lifetimes, and the procedure 
itself is not only common, but also 
safe and legitimate. Though Friday’s 

shooting (and all the violent attacks 
before it) certainly reflects our 
society’s 
unsatisfactory 
state 
of 

mental health and paltry gun laws, 
it’s also an undeniable reverberation 
of the violent and overheated terms 
in which some opponents discuss 
the procedure. Widening the debate 
around abortion to make room for 
language that’s less loaded (and more 
accurate) will begin to neutralize 
the 
topic 
and 
hopefully 
help 

prevent more murders of innocent 
people. Preventing more events 
like last Friday’s is something we 
can all agree upon, whether you’re 
 

pro-choice or not.

Shenanigans with Shuart and Downing

Two best friends 
discuss various 

topics in Michigan 

hockey

By JUSTIN MEYER & 
JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Writer 

& Daily Sports Editor

Michael Downing isn’t nearly 

as intimidating in person as he 
looks on the ice.

Sure, the defenseman is big, 

standing just over 6-foot-2 and 
weighing in at 200 pounds. But 
the vicious playing style that 
lands him in hot water with the 
officials and draws crowds to 
their feet doesn’t jump out.

He has broad shoulders, a lean 

frame topped by a mop of blond 
hair and a wide grin that breaks 
out when he’s joking with his 
teammate and best friend Max 
Shuart.

Shuart, a junior center, doesn’t 

smile. Not on the ice, not in his 
headshot and certainly not in 
the interview room. The fourth-
line 
centerman, 
sometimes 

called “Shu” or “Shuey,” is a true 
grinder. A strong jawline frames 
the mean mug he likes to carry, 
and from his massive thighs, it’s 
easy to see why he can fly on the 
ice. 

But by all accounts, the two 

are all but inseparable off the 
ice. The Daily sat down with 
Downing and Shuart to discuss 
the season, Shuart’s odd swag 
and who would win in a fight 
between the two.

***

Shuart stuck out like a sore 

thumb last season. He was the 
only Michigan player to wear 
a plastic face shield, called the 
“bubble,” instead of a caged mask. 
He said last season that he “didn’t 
want to be the only one,” but he 
was suprised when nine of his 
teammates opted to join him in 
donning the same helmet this 
year.

Downing made the switch, but 

not by choice. He said he only 
switched because of a “personal 
reason” 
that 
his 
teammates 

know about. But making the 
change subsequently removed 
one thing Downing could make 
fun of Shuart for.

They discussed the bubbles:
Downing: Once a lot of guys 

put them on, all the fun went 
away. You couldn’t make fun of 
him any more.

Shuart: There is a lot of 

hypocrisy on the team now 
considering some of the opinions 
in the past on the bubble.

Downing: I don’t mind it.
Shuart: 
It’s 
definitely 
an 

eye-opener about some guys’ 
character.

***

By not sticking out anymore 

and being easily seen on the ice, 
Shuart needed to find a different 
way to accomplish the task. So 
when the team made its stick 
orders during the preseason, 
he was elated to find out no one 
else ordered the same stick as 
him — a Bauer 1X.

“In my opinion, he got a 

little upset that a lot of people 
transitioned from the cage to 
the bubble this year,” said junior 
forward Tyler Motte. “So he’s 
doing something to stand out.”

Added junior forward JT 

Compher: “Maybe he thinks it 
was made specially for him.”

Perhaps 
Shuart 
actually 

believes that: He has made it 
clear no one else on the team 
can use the 1X. Before Downing 
could answer if he’d order 
the stick, Shuart interjected: 
“Nobody will be getting that 
stick!”

In fact, if Downing were not in 

the room with Shuart, the Daily 
wouldn’t have learned what stick 
it is. 

TMD: What stick is it?
Shuart: I don’t want to say in 

front of anyone.

Downing: It’s a (Bauer) 1X.
Shuart: It might be a 1X.
Downing: It’s a 1X.
TMD: Why does no one else 

have it?

Downing: Because it sucks; 

it’s a shitty stick.

Shuart: Say what you will 

about the stick, but it’s been 
getting the job done, I think.

Downing: You are tied with 

JT in goals, right?

Shuart: That’s correct.
TMD: Do you have to special 

order it?

Shuart: No. I was kind of 

shocked no one else got it, 
considering it’s clearly the best 
stick available this year. But if 
I plug Bauer too hard — I don’t 
want the NCAA calling, but it’s 
a good stick. For the readers out 

there, it gets the job done.

***

Statistically, Michigan has the 

fifth-best offense in the country, 
boasting 4.09 goals per game. A 
large part of that success stems 
from 
puck 

possession 
that is helped 
by 
winning 

faceoffs.

While 

Shuart 
uses 

what he thinks 
is the best stick 
on the market, 
it 
hasn’t 

helped 
him 

greatly in the 
circle. Shuart ranks last of the 
Wolverines’ centers in faceoffs, 
winning just 34 of the 83 he has 
taken. So much for the Bauer 1X.

Shuart: 
While 
you’re 

recording here, maybe throw in 
there that I want to improve on 
faceoffs.

TMD: Red told us one player 

needed to practice 150 faceoffs a 
day a couple weeks ago. Was that 
you?

Shuart: It might’ve been, but I 

take anywhere between 150-200 
faceoffs a week.

Before 
Shuart 
could 
finish 

talking, Downing interrupted.

Downing: I have to say, if you 

were going to make an educated 
guess who he told to take 150 
faceoffs, I’m not going to say 
who, but he could be sitting in 
this room.

Shuart: 
Anyway, 
it’s 

something 
I’m 
looking 
to 

improve on.

Downing: 
You’ve 
gotten 

better at faceoffs.

Shuart: I appreciate that.

***

When they’re in the same 

room, 
Downing and 
Shuart act a bit 
like 
brothers 

— it’s easy to 
imagine them 
arguing 
over 

the 
remote. 

Teammates 
say 
their 

favorite topic 
of 
debate 
is 

who 
would 

win a fight.

“They probably talk about 

fighting every day and never 
actually fight,” Compher said.

The Daily dug into the video 

archives to analyze the matchup. 
Shuart fought a few times in 
juniors, and is clearly more of 
a counter-puncher than a true 
fighter. He is scrappy, but easily 
overpowered by opponents with 
longer reaches.

Teammates say Shuart’s best 

quality is his chin, which seems 
appropriate for his grinding 
playing style.

Downing, on the other hand, 

is a pure fighting talent. A 
huge wingspan gives him an 
advantage over Shuart. He’s also 
a very active puncher, throwing 
a flurry of right hands right from 
the outset.

“I think that one might go 

10-12 rounds,” Motte said. “I 

don’t think we’ll ever find a 
winner. Shuey would never give 
up, and Downing would just keep 
going. I’ll take a ticket to that 
fight.”

Downing: I got in a couple 

fights back in the day (USHL). I 
think me and Shuart should’ve 
fought once, but he wouldn’t 
fight me.

Shuart: It was never specific, 

but looking back, we’re such good 
friends that we’d like to know 
who got the win because we 
have pretty different opinions. I 
like to bring the physical edge to 
my game. I got into a few fights 
naturally, but I wouldn’t call 
myself a fighter.

TMD: Are you more of a 

fighter or trash talker?

Shuart: Those two go hand in 

hand in my book. A little bit of 
both.

Downing: 
What 
I 
don’t 

like about college is guys will 
chirp non-stop and call you all 
this stuff because you can’t do 
anything about it. What I liked 
about juniors is that if somebody 
wanted to say something, they 
knew they would have to back 
it up. Whereas college you 
can’t. A lot of guys are all talk 
in college.

TMD: Your penalty minutes 

are down this year.

Downing: I’ve tried to stay on 

the ice. It’ll come eventually. It 
takes a couple games to get the 
timing down. But I don’t want to 
get suspended again. It’ll happen 
again eventually.

TMD: The suspension or the 

big hit? 

Downing: (Laughs)

“I don’t want 

the NCAA 

calling, but it’s a 

good stick.”

Robinson, Wagner play 
key roles for Wolverines

By SIMON KAUFMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

RALEIGH, N.C. — A year ago, 

Duncan Robinson sat on the bench 
in street clothes as Michigan 
hosted Syracuse in the Big Ten/
ACC Challenge. Moritz Wagner 
was in Berlin, Germany, playing 
his games for Alba Berlin, a semi-
professional team. Robinson was 
a Division III transfer who was 
rumored to be a sharp shooter. 
He hadn’t proven a thing yet. 
Wagner was some far-off forward 
unknown to Wolverine fans.

Fast forward a year to the 

2015 Big Ten/ACC Challenge in 
Raleigh, N.C., and Robinson and 
Wagner showed why they’re two 
of the most important pieces for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team this season.

With five minutes left in the 

first half against the Wolfpack on 
Tuesday, Robinson found himself 
open — again — from behind 
the arc and fired. Swish. With 
his fists by his side, the redshirt 
sophomore guard flexed, turned 
toward Michigan’s bench and 
flashed a Hey, did you all see that? 
smile to his teammates. It was the 
third time North Carolina State 
left him open from deep in the 
first frame, and the third time he 
hit.

“I know I’m surprised (they left 

him open), because if we we’re 
playing against a guy like Duncan, 
we would never leave him open,” 
said senior guard Caris LeVert. 
“That’s what we’d be preaching.”

In the second half, with 

Michigan’s once-15-point lead at 
just eight, Wagner caught a pass 
from LeVert, bodied his way to 
the rim, drew a foul and finished 
with a layup. The basket pushed 
the Wolverines back to a double-
digit advantage, and the 6-foot-
10 freshman forward stomped 
toward his teammates on the 
bench, shouted and pounded his 
chest.

It’s a role Wagner has embraced 

— not just the job of scoring but 
that of getting his teammates 
pumped up, too.

“Definitely, I think that’s kind 

of my thing, to give the team 
energy, and it’s what people ask 
me to do,” Wagner said. “I really 
enjoy that role and feel really 
comfortable with it.”

Added LeVert: “Since day one, 

Moe’s brought that energy and 
intensity. We knew he was like 
that. So for him to play like that in 
games, it’s amazing. Having him 
out there with that great energy, 
seeing him smiling and pump up 
the crowd, it’s awesome.”

Robinson 
transferred 

from Williams College — a 
small Division III school in 
Massachusetts 
— 
before 
last 

season, but due to NCAA transfer 
rules, he spent last season on the 
bench. He could practice with 
the team, but he couldn’t play in 
games. Now, in just seven games 
with the Wolverines, Robinson 
has 
established 
himself 
as 

Michigan’s top shooter and first 
guard off the bench. He’s shooting 
57 percent from the field this 
year, and his 60-percent shooting 
percentage from beyond the arc 
ranks third in the country for 
players with at least 20 attempts. 

“It’s deadly,” LeVert said of 

Robinson’s shooting. “When he 
hits a couple in a row, you want 
to look for him every time, every 
opportunity. And he just knocks 
them down.”

Unlike 
Robinson, 
Wagner 

didn’t join the Wolverines with a 
reputation for shooting, or much 
of anything for that matter. He 
didn’t commit until April and 
came in as the biggest question 
mark on the roster. Michigan 
coach John Beilein hyped him up 

before the season started and said 
he’d have some “wow” moments 
despite a big learning curve.

In his last three games, the 

“wows” that have overshadowed 
the 
“ohs.” 
Since 
scoring 
19 

points against Charlotte in the 
Wolverines’ second game at the 
Battle 4 Atlantis, Wagner has gone 
15-for-19 from the field. He tallied 
eight points against the Wolfpack 
on Tuesday, and his 23 minutes 
were a personal NCAA high — he 
played 22 minutes combined in 
Michigan’s first four games.

In the Wolverines’ last three 

contests, Robinson and Wagner 
have produced 68 percent of 
Michigan’s scoring off the bench. 
And in the Wolverines’ first 
true road game at PNC Arena, 
Robinson and Wagner didn’t get 
distracted by the hype and the 
new setting. Robinson also played 
23 minutes, and the two combined 
for 25 points to help Michigan 
claim its second straight Big Ten/
ACC Challenge matchup.

“Of course you feel a little bit 

excited before the game when you 
step into the gym and you shoot 
around,” Wagner said. “But as 
soon as you’re on the court, you’re 
just focusing on the game.”

That focus, from a high-energy 

European and a crisp-shooting 
transfer, could be key as Michigan 
kicks off conference play later this 
month.

As I watched The Mox-

ies grace the main stage of the 
Cleveland Agora on Nov. 20, I 
realized that nothing else in that 
moment mattered. I was watch-
ing one of the most genuine rock 
‘n’ roll bands of our generation 
captivate an audience and hold 
them under a spell for the dura-
tion of their fleeting set. For the 
40-some minutes that The Mox-
ies took over the Agora, I was 
entranced by the way Marco Cio-
fani managed to make his guitar 
growl, releasing a thunderstorm 
of beautifully belted lyrics, all 
while dancing on stage and gal-
vanizing the crowd. And I was 
struck by the way Tyler Adams 
played the bass like it’s just sec-
ond nature. The way Adams 
and Ciofani relate on stage is an 
entirely different phenomenon 
that is fascinating to watch.

“Marco brings the energy to the 

rest of us. He’s dangerous on stage. 
Watch your back,” Adams said.

I can attest to Ciofani’s fero-

ciousness on stage, but I don’t 
think Adams needs to watch 
his back. He and Ciofani play 
together like they’re brothers, like 
they’re yin and yang. I’ve been to 
several of their shows and each 
time it’s the exact same scenario. 
They’ll walk on stage, start play-
ing and Ciofani will get worked 
up. Once Ciofani starts moving 
around, Adams will follow in pur-
suit. With the two of them electri-
fying the stage, it’s only a matter 
of time before their contagious 
energy takes over the crowd.

“All it takes is one person,” Cio-

fani said. “All it takes is one spark 
— people just don’t want to be the 
first one.”

With that mentality, Ciofani 

dances until the crowd gives in. 
The crowd will dance all night 
until Ciofani sacrifices himself to 
them. At their last show, the set 
ended when Ciofani played the 
guitar atop the mass of people 
pushing against the barrier to the 
stage; other shows have ended 
with Ciofani simply snapping the 
strings on his guitar.

The Moxies are such a cohesive 

unit that calling them by their 
instrumental designations seems 
odd. Most bands are known by 
their vocalist, their guitarist, 
their bassist and their drummer, 
but for this trio it doesn’t seem to 
matter who plays what. They all 
jam together on stage just as loud-
ly and just as hard as the other. 
There’s no instrument that over-
powers and there’s no person that 
shines the brightest.

To break the trio down for you, 

let’s start with the most essential 
member of any band: the drum-
mer. When Ciofani formed The 
Moxies in 2011, he asked his friend 
Kevin Werfield to learn how to 
play the drums — because a band 
isn’t a band without a drummer. In 
2014, Werfield quit the band, leav-
ing The Moxies drummer-less. 
When things didn’t work out with 
Landon Hall, A.J. Wilder stepped 
in as the third and current drum-
mer for The Moxies. Wilder, other 
than having an ideal stage name, 
hails from Iowa and played in 
another band down in Nashville 
before lending his hands to The 
Moxies. Judging from his per-
formance at the Agora on Nov. 
20, I would say Wilder knows 
exactly what he’s doing. Though 

he hasn’t been with the band for 
long, it feels like he grew up with 
Ciofani and Adams. The vibe on 
stage seemed completely natural; 
Wilder’s ability to slay his drum 
kit doesn’t hurt either.

The second member of this 

power trio is Tyler Adams. When 
Ciofani wanted to start a band, he 
promptly recruited Adams and 
told him to learn the bass. With-
in a matter of months, Adams 
learned the bass, dropped out of 
Kent State University and joined 
The Moxies full time. Five years 
and a move to Nashville later, and 
I would say it was worth it. Like 
Wilder with his drums, Adams 
has complete control over the 
bass. Not many people appreciate 
the power of the bass guitar, but 
it’s hard not to appreciate it in The 
Moxies’s case. First of all, Adams 
counters Ciofani’s actions on stage 
so it’s literally impossible not to 
notice his dirty blond hair mov-
ing along with the music. Musi-
cally, Adams is hard to ignore as 
well. With each strum of his bass 
guitar, Adams lays the foundation 
for Ciofani while simultaneously 
adding a layer of complexity to 
each song. With a standout bassist 
and drummer commanding both 
the stage and the recording stu-
dio, it becomes easy for Ciofani’s 
sound to pop.

I asked the guys what they 

are listening to now, and Cio-
fani responded to the question 
enthusiastically.

“I love that question. Did I tell 

you to ask that question? I tell 
interviewers to always ask an art-
ist what they’re listening to lately. 
As a fan of other bands, that’s 
what I want to know. What is 
Jerry Lee Lewis listening to in his 
car? I’ve been listening to a lot of 
Queens of the Stone Age. They’re 
just an awesome rock band. No 
one ever showed me them when 
I lived up here (in Cleveland). No 
one was like check these guys out. 
I heard the name but never inves-
tigated it. I couldn’t find out that 
they were one of the flag leaders of 
modern day rock ‘n’ roll. They’re a 
guitar band.”

In addition to appreciating 

bands with a larger reach, The 
Moxies are avid supporters of 
local bands and urge others to 
support their local bands as well.

“We listen to a lot of Jeff the 

Brotherhood — get that.” (Marco 
then proceeds to lean forward 
and shout into my phone, “Jeff the 
Brotherhood!”) “They’re a two-
piece brother band from Nash-
ville. They’re like hillbilly Black 
Sabbath, it’s so fucking sweet. 
We saw them on Halloween night 
and they came out in these dark 
wizard outfits. He’s like standing 
there with his guitar and this wiz-
ard hat and cloak. That was my 
favorite live show in Nashville.”

As for other great shows they 

went to, Dick Dale and Cage the 
Elephant were high up on their 
lists. Worst shows? The band 
remains nameless, but anything 
pop-punk is usually not on their 
list of favorites.

Marco Ciofani’s appreciation 

for great guitar music is partly 
what makes him not only the cre-
ator and lead vocalist of The Mox-
ies, but above all else, the band’s 
guitarist. I love Ciofani’s gritty, 
raw voice; it’s fantastic and it can 
undeniably carry the complex lyr-
ics that he pens, but when he plays 
the guitar, he does so much more 
than just play it.

“When I was 13 years old I said 

fuck sitting down playing the gui-
tar. I love to dance. I was just in 
my little basement in my mom’s 
fiancé’s house and I quit sitting 
down. It brings energy to what 
you do,” Ciofani said.

Clearly Ciofani was a genius 

at the ripe old age of 13, because 
at this point, he has mastered 
the art of not sitting down. The 
amount of passion and energy 
Ciofani pours into his guitar 
when he rips it to shreds on 
stage is enough to bring this 
inanimate object to life. This 
intensity became all the more 
obvious at their most recent 
show at the Agora. Aside from 
a few songs, the remainder of 
their set was comprised of new 
songs that they’ve been working 
on in Nashville for the past year. 
These songs, the songs The Mox-
ies played on Nov. 20, the same 
songs that will appear on their 
debut album, are songs unlike 
anything released this past year, 
arguably this past decade.

It’s been almost three years 

since The Moxies released their 
last EP, so when they previewed 
some of their new music at the 
Agora, it only made me hungrier 
for what’s to come this spring. 
This album will no doubt be a 
catalyst for The Moxies; made in 
Nashville, this album has been 
touched by tenured pros. Jared 
Champion, drummer for Cage the 
Elephant, played drums on three 
tracks while long-time guitarist 
for Cage the Elephant, Lincoln 
Parish, produced and collaborat-
ed on the album as a whole. Cio-
fani and Parish did most of the 
songwriting, usually with Light-
nin’ Hopkins playing in the back-
ground (though when I asked if 
Hopkins’s sound translated onto 
the album, they said it didn’t).

Unlike a lot of music produced 

today, this album wasn’t made in 
a hurry. Parish aptly called the 
songwriting process “an organic 
experience — that’s usually when 
the best stuff comes out.”

When I asked Ciofani what 

influenced him this time around, 
his response was very fitting to 
who he is as a musician: His influ-
ence is “Just guitar … Literally 
just playing the guitar. If there’s 
one thing I really want to do it’s to 
bring back guitar. Because I think 
there’s a space for it. It’s not that 
cool anymore. You don’t hear shit 
like Santana anymore, whether 
you like him or not … I think this 
generation and the next can really 
dig it because there’s been a gap in 
guitar music.”

As far as major differences in 

this album versus their last EP, 
both Adams and Ciofani chimed 
“the groove” in unison. Part of 
the groove they might be refer-
ring to comes by way of the song-
writing process.

“Whenever I’m writing a 

song, if I can’t see some, like, 
22-year-old college chick danc-
ing her ass off to it then I’m not 
doing it right,” Ciofani said. “We 
want to write a record that is a 
dance record, you put it on at a 
party, when you’re driving or 
when you’re with your friends.” 
If their performance at the 
Agora is any indicator of their 
album, which of course it is, then 
I would say they nailed it. With 
the crowd vivaciously dancing 
to songs about vampire love and 
their famed “Black Shadow,” I 
can only imagine what will hap-
pen when people get their hands 
on their entire album.

I

t happens around mid-
November: holiday food 
comes out. Recipes for 

sweet potato casseroles slide 
innocently into our Facebook 
feeds; tan-
talizing 
pies pop 
up in the 
corners 
of Trader 
Joe’s. 
Fresh 
greens 
and but-
ternut 
squash are 
suddenly 
overwhelmed by french-fried 
onions and candied yams, their 
packages covered in recipes for 
butter-laden dishes.

Then 
there’s 
the 
snow, 

justifying 
us 
staying 
in, 

swaddled 
in 
blankets 
and 

fuzzy 
socks. 
Friendsgiving 

dinners are planned, but bike 
rides are canceled due to ice 
and dropping temps. We settle 
into Thanksgiving mode, finals 
mode, sweater-party mode.

And as much as we indulge in 

the glorious food and traditions 
of the season, each serving of 
pumpkin pie often comes with a 
dollop of guilt.

For many people, Thanksgiving 

— and the holiday season in 
general — is an all-or-nothing 
ordeal when it comes to healthy 
choices. On one hand, there’s 
the guy with a devil-may-care 
attitude toward the festivities, 
wolfing down third servings in 
sweatpants and abandoning the 
gym until New Year’s Resolution 
time rolls around. Then there’s 
the joyless warrior who’s sticking 
to her diet no matter what, 
replacing every side dish with its 
healthy substitute and manically 
bragging about how many calories 
she saved over “Thinsgiving.”

And there’s the half million 

people, 
myself 
included, 

who ran a “Turkey Trot” on 
Thanksgiving 
Day, 
racing 

distances of 5k to marathon to 
offset the big meal to come. We 
all want to have our cake and eat 
it too, without tipping the scale 
like Santa or glaring at frosting 
like the Grinch. So instead of 
sacrificing snickerdoodles, we 
may kill ourselves in the gym, 
crushing the guilt from holiday 
binges to a minimum.

But in the middle of a two-

hour “Turkey Burn” spin class, 
when you’re cursing the wine 
and cheese from Aunt Kathy’s 
house, you may ask yourself: Is 
this good for me? Is exercise 
healthy if it’s only in response 
to guilty binges?

The problem is, if we only exer-

cise because we feel obligated to 
— so we’ll really deserve that slice 
of pecan pie — fitness develops a 
negative connotation. To counter 
this attitude, Women’s Health has 
recently promoted “Guilt Free Fit-
ness,” encouraging working out 
because it makes us stronger, not 
because we feel that we need to 
earn the bird. “Cycling is about 
conquering a steep climb so you 
can experience the high of flying 
downhill — not working off a tur-
key dinner. Let’s change the con-
versation,” the magazine urges.

In theory, their mantra rings 

true. Exercise is so much more 
than a means to fitting in a party 
dress. We shouldn’t run because 
we’re ashamed of our bodies; we 
should run because we love our 
bodies and want to nourish them.

But “Guilt Free Fitness” is 

harder in practice. No matter 
if we live healthy lifestyles or 
struggle to stay on diets, during 
the holidays, we’ve probably all 
had the same thought: Man, I 
really need to workout. We’re 
not 
necessarily 
punishing 

ourselves, at least not in an 
unhealthy way. I think about it 
like this: If I have the choice of 
grinding out two more miles or 
beating myself up for overeating 
later, I’ll choose to run — and 
I’m sure others (ahem, Turkey 
Trotters) agree.

But are we guilty of guilty 

fitness? I asked alum Brittany 
Ryann Thorpe, a 2014 School 
of Kinesiology graduate who’s 
pursuing 
her 
M.S. 
degree 

in 
Clinical 
Physiology 
and 

Metabolism at Virginia Tech, 
for her opinion on how to stay 
healthy over the holidays.

“I enjoy doing extra work 

before eating the rich food,” 
said Thorpe, who was a member 

of the University Rowing and 
Cross Country teams. “Because 
then I don’t feel as guilty when 
I do stuff my face with the 
holiday treats. I prefer to hate 
my workout a little that day 
more than hate how I feel about 
myself after consuming that 
food and not working out.”

As a past personal trainer at 

Ann Arbor’s Applied Fitness 
Solutions, Thorpe is familiar 
with the challenge of staving off 
weight gain without sacrificing 
the holiday season.

“The 
holidays 
can 
be 
a 

defeating time for many people 
in terms of maintaining a diet 
and keeping up with their 
workout routines,” she said. 
“It’s best to encourage people 
to maintain good habits over 
the holidays, but still find 
enjoyment in the festive season. 
After all, if you don’t eat that 
slice of pie you really want, if 
later in the season you become 
defeated with your diet, you 
may find yourself eating the 
whole pie instead!”

Thorpe continued, “Accept 

that you might — and most likely 
will — gain a bit more weight 
on the holidays, but don’t feel 
defeated in your efforts to eat 
better and work out.”

Like 
all 
things 
in 
the 

holidays, there’s bad news and 
good news. The bad news is that 
your grandma might ask about 
your love life, your runs may 
be in sub-zero temps and you’ll 
probably gain a few pounds 
from the pound cakes. The good 
news? You’re surrounded by 
good food, friends and family. 
Just because it’s winter doesn’t 
mean you have to hibernate. 
Being active can simply mean 
taking your little sister ice 
skating, hiking out to get that 
perfect tree, or going shopping 
with your mom.

And 
if 
you 
want 
more? 

Register for the Jingle Bell Run. 
Have the slice of pie. Because 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
holiday 

traditions, whether they be 
active or indulgent, I say the 
more the merrier. Stay moving 
and save splurges for special 
occasions, then leave the dollop 
of guilt at home.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 Here is a music video 
from two true originals: 
Kevin Abstract, a 19-year-old 
hip-hop 
artist and 
songwriter, 
under the 
direction of 
the 20-year-
old Tyler 
Mitchell, an 
up-and-coming photographer 
based in New York City, 
collaborated together to create 
the music video for Abstract’s 
recent single, “ECHO.” 
Sadness and confusion in the 
face of a personal loss is the 
initial outline that the moody 
lyrics and instrumentation of 
“ECHO” provides. The artistic 
eyes of Mitchell and Abstract 
heighten this emotion with 
the juxtaposition of something 
strange against simple action: 
a motorcycle helmet-clad 
Kevin riding a merry-go-
round, or a lazy, yellow-haired 
and coolly-dressed Tyler 
haphazardly driving a bicycle 
down a park’s sidewalk. 
There are the wandering 
eyes of Abstract, peering 
through the darkened lens 
of his motorcycle helmet, 
as he travels through some 
undefined tunnel.
 Something broke, but he’s 
still moving forward. The 
sand of something slipped 
through his fingers, and now 
he’s left on the other side, 
pondering it all to excess. 
Unsure of where to go, or of 
how far away he can really 
go, Mitchell helps Abstract 
capture some strange sort of 

sadness in “ECHO.”
 The strange and original 
visuals build upon one another 
as the song travels towards its 
climax. And there, at the apex, 
Abstract crawls and cries in 
some reddened pile of sand. 
You don’t understand it, the 
situation or how he got there, 
but you feel the emotion. You 
somehow, in some foreign 
way, understand his pain.

 Abstract and Mitchell are 
modern reminders that age 
doesn’t determine talent. 
These young innovators are 

meddling with the platforms 
of their visual and musical 
appearance. Abstract is 
testing the borders of the hip-
hop in his upcoming release 
with his boy-band troupe, 
Brockhampton. He croons 
like Kanye, and mixes beats 
into something a little more 
chilled. His newest release, 
while shrouded in mystery, 
is set to release in early 2016. 
Mitchell is a photographer 
and videographer who hates 
Instagram. Armored by 
talent, Mitchell has set out 
to avoid the motivations that 
modern artists of his field 
find in the Tumblr re-blogs 
and Instagram likes. He’s sick 
of it — he is suffocated by it — 
and is hoping to descend it all. 
These boys aren’t demanding 
attention: they are letting the 
public eye naturally glide over 
to their exciting originality 
and individuality.

TRAILER REVIEW

 The legend of Krampus in 
Alpine folklore is a strange one. 
Saint Nicholas was believed to 
have a number 
of “compan-
ions” that 
accompanied 
him around 
Europe during 
the Christ-
mas holiday. 
Among these 
was an anthro-
pomorphic 
figure called Krampus, who 
was thought to be, in a sense, 
the anti-Santa Claus. Krampus, 
with cloven hooves and goat 
horns, would punish misbehav-
ing children, often in gruesome 
ways. The truly troubling part of 
this legend, the film adaptation 
seems to argue, is that nothing 
can be done to curb the wrath of 
this devilish figure.
 “Krampus” is being mar-
keted as a black comedy, horror 
holiday film, which begs the 
question: when was the last 
time you saw, or even heard 

about, a movie like that? Think 
for a minute, what was the last 
successful Christmas horror 
movie? “Bad Santa?” Credit 
must be given where credit 
is due, and director Michael 
Dougherty (“Trick ‘r Treat”) 
deserves some recognition for 
bringing us a unique, if not 
totally strange, spin on the holi-
day film genre.
 The movie appears to suf-
fer from the all-too-common 
bout of jump-scares and pos-

sessed toys. Scary music cues, 
dark corners and restricted 
camera angles abound. While 
the demonic figure itself isn’t 
shown, viewers get the idea: 
twisted horns, a creepy gait, 
weird snarls. The true hor-
ror of the movie, as with the 
legend, has nothing to do with 
the monster or the surprise — 
it’s the idea that children, the 
innocent gems of the Christmas 
holiday, cannot escape evil.

COURTESY OF ERIN ZINDLE

Erin Zindle (left) is the lead singer of Ann Arbor band The Ragbirds.

Ragbird puts on her 
eighth installment 

at The Ark 

By REBECCA LERNER 

Daily Arts Writer

“This is not your mama’s 

Christmas show,” Erin Zindle 
said 
in 
between 
infectious 

laughs. 
“But 

it’s the kind of 
show that can 
be enjoyed by 
moms and dads 
and grandmas 
and little kids 
and 
people 

of 
all 
ages, 

and so there’s 
something for 
everyone in it.”

The 

Christmas 
show Zindle is talking about 
is the eighth annual Ebird and 
Friends Annual Holiday Show, 
to be held at The Ark on Dec. 
11. Zindle, otherwise known as 
Ebird, is the lead vocalist and 
instrumentalist of the local 
band The Ragbirds, a five-
piece band she started with her 
husband about 10 years ago.

The 
Ragbirds’s 
musical 

influences 
vary 
across 

categories 
and 
continents. 

When they started out, Zindle 
and her husband would busk on 
the streets of Ann Arbor with 
her gypsy and Celtic inspired 
fiddle 
while 
her 
husband 

provided the percussion. With 
the folk elements driving their 
multicultural perspective, The 
Ragbirds call their style of 
music folk rock with a world 
influence.

The 
Ragbirds’s 
love 
of 

musical diversity also inundates 
the style of the holiday show. 
With a vast assortment of 
artists 
ranging 
from 
indie 

bluegrass band The Accidentals 
to Sean Ike from the funk soul 
band Third Coast Kings, Zindle 
is making sure all kinds of 
music are represented.

“This year we have The 

Accidentals joining us. And 
they’re just adorable and they’re 
going to be part of my string 
section. I’ve got the horns from 
Rhyta and my friend Brandon 
(Smith) 
from 
Appleseed 

Collective 
and 
Jessica 

McCumons, whose voice just 
blows me away,” Zindle said. 
“We’re covering so many styles. 
There’s going to be classic and 
old timey and gyspy fiddle and 

jazz, soul, funk horns and big 
show-stopping 
R&B 
pieces, 

some tender hearted folk and 
everything in between.”

Zindle handpicks the artists 

to play at the show every year, 
allowing her to display the both 
local and far-reaching talents 
of her friends and family.

“We’re 
all 
admirers 
and 

friends and there’s a mutual 
admiration of the musicians 
on 
board. 
When 
we 
play 

together you see that onstage. 
Everybody’s really lit up and 
thrilled to be there because 
they get to play with these 
cool 
musicians 
onstage 
for 

one special evening. It’s a one 
time only thing. Every year 
it’s different, and it gets better 
every year. It improves every 
single year and it’s amazing.”

As it has for the past five 

years, the Ebirds and Friends 
Holiday Show will take place 
at 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 
musical 

institution, The Ark.

“It’s a tiny stage for 22 people 

to be on, but we make it work. 
It’s a great spot to do the show 
because there’s a warm and 
friendly vibe in the crowd and 
the people who come to The 
Ark are just ready for the show,” 
Zindle said. “They’re just so 
into it, and very present and 
active and involved. There’s so 
many volunteers and people 
who run The Ark who are big 
fans of the show and they’re 
there to celebrate it with us. It’s 
a lot of fun.”

But 
it’s 
no 
surprise 

that people are excited to 
collaborate with The Ragbirds. 
After working with producer 
Jamie 
Candiloro, 
who 
has 

also worked with artists like 
R.E.M. and Willie Nelson, The 
Ragbirds will be releasing their 
fifth studio album in early 2016. 
Zindle is planning a national 
tour after the release.

“We are so thrilled about 

the new album. It’s everything 
about where we started from 
and our inspiration from world 
music. I feel like we’ve done so 
much travelling physically and 

musically and our music has 
reflected all of that,” Zindle said. 
“With this new album, it just 
feels more like coming home.”

But in the meantime, Zindle 

will be coming home through 
her 
work 
on 
the 
holiday 

show. The show recreates the 
familial feelings that Zindle 
experienced as a child during 
the holiday season.

“When I was growing up, 

my family would make music 
only once a year,” Zindle said. 
“We had a really big family and 
they would gather together on 
Christmas Eve. It was my first 
experience of music as a joyous 
community bonding experience. 
And I felt that really deep in my 
soul. And it became my favorite 
part of that gathering. I would 
kind of rush through the gifts 
and the food and be like, ‘OK 
when do we get to sing?’”

While the show’s inspiration 

stems from the music of late 
holiday nights of her childhood, 
the result is the creation of a 
new family and an evolution of 
Zindle’s meaning of home.

“It’s been many years and 

my family doesn’t gather like 
that anymore. I’m here in 
Michigan, and I was originally 
from Buffalo, N.Y. So I’m even 
removed physically from my 
family,” Zindle said. “But now, 
I have this wonderful Ann 
Arbor musical family and I 
wanted to have a reason to say, 
‘Let’s get together in one place 
and play all together.’ This was 
the perfect theme to make the 
centerpiece of the community 
gathering. It was a good way to 
get creative around what can be 
seen as a cheesy style of music, 
like Christmas music. But we 
have such talented and creative 
people that we have fresh, 
inspired and interesting takes 
on old tunes. And every year 
we feature some wonderful 
original songs.”

The best part of the holiday 

show for Zindle is its capacity 
for bringing people together. 
Alongside friends and fellow 
musicians, she can ignite a spirit of 
the holidays that most performers 
can only dream of kindling.

“The whole night is thrilling 

to put together, and I’ve had so 
many people come to the first 
show and they’re like, ‘I need to 
get tickets to tomorrow! I want 
to see it again.’ When people 
see it, they want to come back 
year after year, and tell their 
friends and family, and it grows 
year after year because it brings 
people so much joy.”

EPISODE REVIEW

 “South Park” continued its 
most subversive season in years 
with “Sponsored Content,”which 
unveiled 
secrets behind 
some of the 
town’s big 
changes and 
leaving fans 
anxious to find 
out what hap-
pens next.
 Though 
“South Park” 
has used in-
show continu-
ity in the past, never has it done 
so to the extent of season 19. Over 
the course of the last eight epi-
sodes, new aspects of the show 
— Historic Shi Tpa Town and 
PC Principal to name a few—are 
slowly being revealed as an elab-
orate conspiracy that threatens 
the town’s very existence. 
 In “Sponsored Content,” the 

South Park Elementary news-
paper became the most trusted 
news source in America. Mean-
while, its editor Jimmy contend-
ed with PC Principal who the 
paper accuses of using “PC” to 
mean ... well something else.
 “Sponsored Content” might 
not have been the funniest 
episode this season, but it’s a 

comforting sign that the show’s 
recent changes are leading some-
where interesting.
 It’s way too early to tell, but the 
season 19 arc might just be the 
most elaborate thing “South Park” 
has done in a very long time, keep-
ing the show’s trademark edge 
and relevance despite its age.

COMEDY CENTRAL

“When people 
see it, they want 

to come back 

year after year.”

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

“If I wanna do something, 

I just do it. I don’t sit around 
and plan. If I wanna work with 
someone or go somewhere, I’m 
just gonna pray it works and go.”

I 
could 
immediately 
tell 

Grant Yarber, aka YOG$, was a 
by-any-means-necessary 
type 

of dude. Yarber, a senior here 
at the University, is an insanely 
talented artist with dreams of 
making it in the music industry 
as a producer and businessman. 
He took last winter off to work 
with some of the most exciting 
names in rap music, and has 
since returned to finish his 
studies before diving head first 
into the music industry.

“I was in L.A. for winter 

break, and things were moving 
so fast I knew I couldn’t leave. I 
called my parents and decided to 
stay in L.A., and that’s when I got 
the Dom (Kennedy) placement. I 
almost didn’t come back.”

Grant 
has 
a 
knack 
for 

throwing around huge names 
casually, so I could tell he’s 
been doing this for a while. I 
had to resist the urge to cut 
him off mid-sentence when he 
started running through his 
repertoire of collaborators. “I 
had a goal set for myself when 
I was 17: I wanted to work with 
Dom Kennedy, Casey Veggies, 
Sir Michael Rocks and Rockie 
Fresh. Four years later, I’ve 
worked with each of them in 
one way or another.”

He has a strong working 

relationship with Los Angeles-
based 
MC 
Niko 
G4, 
and 

through him he met Ricky Hil 
(son of Tommy Hilfiger). Hil 
lives with Aaron Reid (son of 
L.A. Reid) in Hollywood, and 
Yarber has developed working 
relationships with all of them 
through 
the 
sheer 
quality 

of his work and charismatic 
personality.

At just 21 years old, Yarber 

also has plenty of insight on the 
inner-workings of the music 
industry. He tells me what we 
hear from artists is only the tip 
of the iceberg, and he has plenty 
of ridiculous stories for every 
lesson learned.

“I was producing a song with 

Aaron Reid when Rich (Hil) 
came through and he was vibing 
to it. And then Dom came over. 
And then Casey (Veggies) came 
over. And then Niko came over. 
All of a sudden we’re about to 
make this crazy L.A. posse-cut; 
they all had their verses and 
were ready to record this song.”

Rich called his engineers to 

see if anyone could come record 
them, but unfortunately it was 
too late and the song ultimately 
fell through. All that’s left 
are remnants of a song that 
never was. But of course, Grant 
wouldn’t be where he is today 
without being an opportunist. 
“I’m still sitting on that beat. I’ll 
probably play it for Dom next 
time I’m in the studio with him.”

After 
consulting 
with 
his 

parents, Grant decided to come 
back to Ann Arbor to finish 
school. Despite being here for 
most of the year, Yarber doesn’t 
use his studies as a crutch for 
slowing down his musical output.

“When I’m in Ann Arbor, I 

can just hone in and focus on 

improving my craft. It’s funny, 
Kanye talks about doing five beats 
a day for three summers; I’ve been 
doing that for five years!”

With all the huge names 

surrounding 
him, 
it’s 
easy 

to forget that Grant is also 
enrolled at the University, and 
like all of us, faces the same 
struggles that come with being 
here as a student. He discussed 
the challenges of sustaining 
these relationships with artists 
in L.A. while studying for 
exams and writing papers in 
Ann Arbor.

“When you’re in the studio 

with someone, it’s way more 
personal than just e-mailing 
beats. You can create and see 
where 
the 
boundaries 
are, 

where I can push someone and 
be pushed as well. When I’m in 
Ann Arbor the whole process 
can feel distant; in L.A. it’s just 
easier to do things organically.”

While Los Angeles is known 

for its deep roots in hip-hop 
history, 
Grant 
has 
actually 

been expanding his palette by 
delving more into pop music. “I 
love rap, and I’m always gonna 
work in it, but pop is my shit! 
One of my goals for the next 
five to 10 years is to produce 
an album for Lorde. That’s my 
favorite artist right now, and 
that’s the direction I’m going.”

Transitioning from rap to 

pop shouldn’t be that hard, 
because “rap is already moving 
in that direction,” according 
to Yarber. “The way rap is 
changing is creating something, 
that when you hear it, it’s not 
like ‘This is rap’ or ‘This is pop.’ 
It just is what it is.” He cites 
the juxtaposition of Future 
and Drake on What A Time to 
be Alive, new-wave rap artists 
like GoldLink and of course 
the 
family-friendly 
fire 
of 

Donnie Trumpet & The Social 
Experiment’s Surf.

YOG$ recently produced an 

absolute monster of a track for 
Alex Wiley titled “Navigator 
Truck,” that he says was the 
first time he got to show a more 
diverse side of his production 
skills. “If I take the drums off, 
it would just be like a mellow, 
indie-style beat.”

“Navigator Truck” is really 

the beginning of something 
special for Yarber, as it features 
a show-stopping feature from 
Chicago MC Chance the Rapper.

“I was in Starbucks just 

doing homework and listening 
to samples when it hit me out of 
nowhere. I immediately started 
chopping up the sample on my 
laptop keyboard, right there in 
Starbucks, and sent it to (Alex) 
Wiley when I was done.”

After a period of silence, 

which Grant says is common, 
Wiley got back to him to let 
him know he made two songs 
with his beats. No word on 
the Chance feature yet. A day 

later he rolled over, still in 
bed, and read a text saying he’s 
got Chance and Twista on his 
songs. “I just rolled back over 
and went back to sleep. When 
I saw that, I wasn’t gonna go 
crazy and tell everyone. You 
have to take everything with a 
grain of salt.”

Wary 
of 
songs 
falling 

through at the last minute, 
Yarber played his cool until the 
song actually materialized. “I 
was at a party and my Twitter 
was just completely blowing 
up. I put my phone to my ear to 
check the song out and then I 
heard the Chance verse … I went 
up to one of my best friends to 
show him, and then someone 
dropped the word that ‘Chance 
is on a YOG$ beat.’ They put it 
on and everyone got to listen.” 
Chance pops up at the end of the 
track and completely steals the 
show, rhyming “Scooter from 
Madonna” with “Dinner with 
Obamas.” His staccato bars jab, 
duck and weave around Yarber’s 
synthy beat.

Though Grant hasn’t directly 

linked 
up 
with 
Chance, 

he’s 
certainly 
hopeful 
of 

collaborating further in the 
future.

“You can’t force music, and 

Surf is definitely something 
you can tell was just natural. I 
got people telling me to bring 
in electric guitar and make 
electronic music in general, 
but at the end of the day I gotta 
make whatever is most natural. 
If you’re just doing one lane 
now, you’re just losing.”

YOG$’s 
emphasis 
on 

authenticity 
means 
he 

naturally 
draws 
inspiration 

from and seeks to emulate 
one of the greatest figures in 
contemporary music: Def Jam 
co-founder, 
Rick 
Rubin. 
“I 

know when I meet Rick Rubin, 
he’ll see his younger self in me. 
We both just have the same 
approach to music; he’ll really 
talk to artists and get the most 
out of them. He does whatever 
the art calls for, and that’s how 
I’ve been handling everything.”

That Rubin stepped away 

from 
production 
and 
fell 

more into creative direction 
and administrative roles is 
particularly 
telling. 
When 

asked about a possible career 
as a performer, Yarber already 
knew where he was steering his 
career.

“I don’t wanna be that guy on 

stage. I wanna be the guy behind 
the scenes putting it all together. 
I don’t even care about the 
credits. Just once you hear that 
sound, I want the gratification 
of you experiencing the music 
exactly the way I want. I put the 
emphasis on the art. The music 
always comes first.”

If there’s one thing you can’t 

accuse Grant Yarber of, it’s not 
thinking big enough. He knows 
exactly 
where 
he’s 
aiming, 

and he’s on track to his target 
to write his name in the same 
history books as Rick Rubin and 
Pharrell Williams.

“This has been my biggest 

year by far. This is the first year 
I started working with major 
artists, and I got my first album 
placement. That’s something 
I’ve been working towards my 
whole life. My next stop has to 
be a Grammy.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Capricorn (Dec. 22 to Jan. 

19): You will read the remain-
der of this article — Ha! See 
what I did there? Nah, I’m just 
kidding. You’ll lead a dissatisfy-
ing life and die when you’re 43 
years old. Your kids will never 
know you. Your last words will 
be: “Mortgage.”

Aquarius (Jan. 20 to Feb. 

18): Tomorrow will be the best 
day of your life, but you’ll over-
sleep and miss it.

Pisces (Feb. 19 to March 20): 

You will light your ring finger 
on fire. It won’t symbolize any-
thing. But it will hurt ... because 
of the fire.

Aries (March 21 to April 19): 

All. Day. Tuna.

Guys Named Tim: You will 

kind of trip on the sidewalk, but 
you’ll pretty much keep your 
balance. Like, it’ll be fine, Tims.

Taurus (April 20 to May 

20): Tomorrow: Day and sun-
light will slide over the horizon 
like a sheet and cover the land. 
You will emerge from your hut, 
coated in a thin layer of grease, 
sand and pig excrement. You 
will shield your eyes, hoist your 
spear and pierce a water buffalo. 
You will skin the buffalo and 
the skin will be used to warm 
your family, your village, your-
self. You, your wife and your 

three remaining children will 
devour the meat, and it will taste 
so juicy, so sweet because you 
haven’t eaten anything in weeks. 
Your son, Indigo, will whis-
per, “Thank you, Father. Thank 
you for keeping me alive.” Next 
week, you will be 10 minutes 
late to work and get deducted an 
hour’s worth of pay. But on the 
bright side, your wife packed you 
a buffalo sandwich.

Gemini (May 21 to June 20): 

You hate attention, but you love 
seaweed. You’ll grow old alone 
because that’s a bad combination 
for mate attraction.

Cancer (June 21 to July 22): 

Hillary Clinton will drop in 
the polls when she’s seen dart-
ing her eyes back and forth. 
But nothing will happen to you 
because you’re not Hillary Clin-
ton or the polls.

Leo (July 23 to Aug. 22): You 

will deceive a Scorpio into lov-
ing you. Well done. Proceed to 
Phase Two.

Virgo (Aug. 23 to Sept. 22): 

Everyone born in late August 
and the first two-thirds of Sep-
tember will assemble at my 
apartment, remove their clothes 
and sing “Livin’ La Vida Loca.” 
Then, we will weep, for what 
lands are left to conquer?

Libra (Sept. 23 to Oct. 22): 

OK, so you’ll meet this girl and 
you’ll go out on a date with her 
and it’ll go great, but then you’ll 
meet her the next day and she’ll 
be all like, “I don’t know you,” 
and you’ll be like, “What!” but it’s 
just because she has this thing 
called, “anterograde amnesia” 
which basically means she has 
short term memory loss, so you’ll 
take her out like 50 times or 
something and she won’t remem-
ber you at first, but then she will, 
but then she doesn’t want to get 
in the way of your job or whatev-
er, you know, and, well, long story 
short, you live happily ever on a 
boat in the Arctic Ocean! Yay! Oh, 
and she kind of looks like Drew 
Barrymore, which is fine.

Scorpio (Oct. 23 to Nov. 21): 

Mercury is in retrograde which 
means Scorpios are in flux while 
Jupiter and Saturn settle their 
custody battle over Pluto, which, 
of course, really just wants to 
live with Neptune, which is also 
in retrograde? To boil it down, 
things 
aren’t 
looking 
great. 

You’re going to fall down a mine-
shaft.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22 to Dec. 

21): Congratulations, you are the 
433rd reader of this article! You 
will never be empty again.

Go in peace.
Except for you, Sharon. 

SINGLE REVIEW

 For reasons still being 
unearthed in therapy, my mind 
jumps to three things at the men-
tion of the 
month of 
December: 
my dead 
dog, Peanut, 
the white 
dress I wore 
to my first 
communion 
and King 
Krule’s 6 
Feet Beneath The Moon. It was 
during the chilly December 
of 2013 that this equally chilly 
album soundtracked my first 
homecoming since departing 
for college, a time characterized 
by a lot of aimless driving and 
overwhelming nostalgia for high 
school. And now, two years later, 
at the start of December 2015, 
it seems I have some new King 
Krule material to get me through 
another winter break full of aim-
less driving and the even more 
overwhelming confusion of 
approaching adulthood.
 Appropriately announced on 
Dec. 1, King Krule (aka Archy 
Marshall) will release a multi-
disciplinary volume of work 

titled A New Place 2 Drown. 
The project, set to drop on the 
10th, features an art book and a 
documentary, accompanied by 
a 37-minute new album. A few 
tracks — “Any God of Yours,” 
”Sex With Nobody” and “Arise 
Dear Brother” — are already 
available on the project’s website, 
which requires you to inconve-
niently hold down the music tab 
while the songs play; if you let go, 
they stop. (My fingers got tired, 
so I ended up placing the bowl 
of fried rice I was eating on my 
track pad.)
 Of the new songs, “Arise Dear 
Brother” is the fullest of the 
three. It follows the artist’s often-

employed format: discussion of 
trouble with a lover, featuring an 
erratic drum loop and some dark 
jazz chords, met by his mellow 
baritone vocals. But Krule seems 
different; he’s still angry and 
desperate to appear apathetic — 
“Even though you fucked him / 
I don’t really give a shit” — but 
this time, he’s also more accept-
ing of reality — “It reminds me 
why she’s not my kind.” Though 
the track would fit in comfort-
ably with the rest of Beneath 
The Moon, it gives us a glimpse 
of a more mature Marshall and 
reminds us the 21-year-old is just 
trying to grow up, too.

On Nov. 27, Jack White’s 

record 
store 
“Third 
Man 

Records” had its grand opening 
on Canfield St., giving the body 
of the Cass Corridor a beat-
ing heart. The store was filled 
to the brim with a line of bod-
ies spilling outside of the door 
that wrapped around the cor-
ner. The weather was distaste-
ful, but no fan seemed to mind 
having wet clothes if it meant 
they could get into the store on 
opening day. As security guard 
Anthony Bilack recalled, “Peo-
ple were pitching tents to get in 
since five in the morning yes-
terday.”

From the outside, Third Man 

is just a brick wall with win-
dows that let you peek at the 
wonders inside. But those win-
dows are slightly tinted black, 
so you have to go in to get the 
full effect. It stands in between 
the Jolly Pumpkin, a local bar, 
and a high-end clothing store. 
On the curb in front of the 
establishment sits a truck that 
says, “Rolling Record Store.” 
It’s black and yellow and fits 
the aesthetic of the interior of 

Third Man and sells only 12” 
and 7” records.

Inside of Third Man there are 

black and yellow tiled counters 
that hold Third Man Records 
merchandise along with some 
White Stripes paraphernalia. Jack 
White’s creativity floods the store 
with intricately designed ceil-
ings that are made up of square 
silver plates. There’s a listen-
ing booth that sits to the right of 
a stage showered in blue lights 
and there are records from The 
White Stripes, The Dead Weather 
and other bands that were signed 
under Third Man that line a hall-
way in the back that leads to the 
pressing plant.

The pressing plant is only 

colored in red and yellow and, 
according to the store’s reissuing 
manager Dave Buick, the plant 
will help create jobs in the neigh-
borhood. Dressed in a black suit 
with a gold tie — the uniform of 
all of the store’s male workers, 
including Jack White himself — 
Buick describes that his job is to 
reissue old albums that should be 
brought back and to help scout 
talent in Michigan to sign under 
Third Man.

“Detroit will be good for us,” 

Buick said, explaining that this 
is “Detroit Rock City,” and Jack 
White wants to really make a dif-
ference in this area. Aside from 

opening Third Man in the loca-
tion close to where Jack White 
first performed, Buick explained 
that the Cass Corridor was spe-
cifically chosen as the location in 
hopes to bring the creative and 
artsy scene back.

“We want to get rid of the junk-

ies and really bring creativity back 
here,” Buick said. He hopes that 
Third Man Records will act as a 
tourist attraction, a record store 
for music appreciators to browse 
in, a record pressing factory and a 
recording studio. The stage in the 
front room will hold poetry read-
ings, stand-up comedy acts and 
local band performances.

“We have other plans for the 

future. This store isn’t the only 
thing we had in mind,” Buick 
said. White, Buick and the rest 
of the team are brainstorming 
ways to keep the public on their 
toes and to continue to give back 
to Detroit. Jack White’s pas-
sion to bring the city back to life 
shows in the contributions he 
has made. Witnessing the fall of 
the neighborhood he grew up in, 
which is just a few blocks away 
from where Third Man Records 
now stands, Jack White is just 
trying to make his hometown feel 
like home again.

Melanie Martinez is twenty 

years old. Each side of her hair 
is dyed a different color, often 
pink and black. Her lips are 
regularly painted dark purple 
or blue, her hair adorned with 
bows. She has tattoos of hearts, 
cartoon 
animals 
and 
toys 

covering her arms. She’s an 
artist. She’s a crybaby.

Martinez 
began 
on 
“The 

Voice” in 2012, gaining notoriety 
for her original takes on hits 
like “Toxic” by Britney Spears 
and “Cough Syrup” by Young 
the Giant. Though she didn’t 
win the competition, Martinez 
received 
a 
contract 
from 

Atlantic Records. Since then, she 
has exploded, and on her first 
full-length album, she exudes 
artistry and personal ingenuity.

Cry Baby was released in 

August. 
As 
mentioned 
on 

her website, the soundscape 

plays largely on Martinez’s 
fascination 
with 
vintage 

toys and the influence of her 
father’s interest in old-school 
hip hop. Tracks like “Carousel” 
relate the music to the lyrics, 
using carnivalesque melodies 
and robust beats to launch 
listeners into the setting of the 
narrative. Martinez uses trance 
tones, playful pings and hip-
hop beats to craft her sound. 
With 
ominous 
undertones, 

the fantastical and whimsical 
instrumentation 
compliments 

her dark and satirical lyricism.

Spanning 
sixteen 
songs, 

Cry Baby, a beast of an album, 
tackles Martinez’s emotional 
past. It’s a conceptual album, 
and it uses both vocal and lyrical 
cues to spin listeners a tale of a 
young life gone awry. Prominent 
subject 
matter 
includes 

substance abuse, adultery, body 
image and isolation. Martinez 
creates an alter ego, Cry Baby, 
to play out the fantasies created 

through her music. Much like 
Marina and the Diamonds and 
her Electra Heart persona, Cry 
Baby is featured in all of the 
music videos for the album. 
The constancy of theme and 
character push the album’s 
narrative 
from 
a 
purely 

musical and lyrical experience 
to a visual representation of 
Martinez’s artistry. She tells a 
story, but she obfuscates what 
is fact and what is fiction. 
The storyline revolves around 
Martinez’s childhood label of a 
“crybaby,” how she was deemed 
overly emotional by her peers 
and, consequently, how she 
thought it to be true. Rather 
than shying away from this 
taunt, she embraces it.

Martinez’s 
acceptance 
of 

her emotions empowers her. By 
outing herself as an intrinsically 
emotional 
being, 
she 
takes 

away the ability of others to 
bash her for it — her lack of 
stoicism is a sign of strength. 

She owns her insecurity and, 
through its ownership, is able 
to come to terms with herself 
and invite listeners to do the 
same. Cry Baby is complexly, 
painfully honest and writing 
if off as nothing more than 
emotional pop drivel isn’t an 
option. Martinez’s agency over 
her own emotional state allows 
her to express her traditionally 
feminine 
characteristics 

without 
falling 
into 
the 

stereotype. She’s open about 

her relationship with her mind, 
showing that even things with 
sweet exteriors may only be a 
coating for serious underlying 
issues.

Martinez takes the trope of 

the 
sensationally 
emotional 

woman and throws in her 
own 
kink. 
Her 
hyperbolic 

use 
of 
femininity 
paired 

with 
her 
cynical 
lyricism 

creates a persona unlike any 
female figure currently in the 
mainstream. She always wears 

makeup and has her hair done, 
but her makeup is dark and her 
hair is unnatural. Her girly, 
frilly attire is dainty, yet it’s 
somewhat 
off-putting 
when 

worn by a grown woman. When 
simplistic, singing of carnivals 
and birthday parties is innocent. 
But it becomes perverse with 
the addition of adult metaphors. 
Cry Baby plays with society’s 
emotional standards and sheds 
light onto the power of the self-
controlled, self-aware woman.

Melanie Martinez’s 
emotions empower
