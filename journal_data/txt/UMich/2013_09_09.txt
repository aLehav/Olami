' N.D. win caps weekend of events

University fills weekend
with activities to deter
heavy alcohol use
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK and
PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editors
It was (pretty much) all fun and
games this weekend.
Friday and Saturday, the University
sponsored and partnered with other

campus organizations to put on a host
of events meant to provide alternative
activities to traditional game-weekend
activities before Saturday night's game
against the University of Notre Dame.
Dean of Students Laura Blake Jones,
associate vice president for student
affairs, said her office had been plan-
ning for this weekend for about five
months. The result was a "five-pronged"
high-risk behavior prevention strategy.
The Office of Student Life worked
with the Division of Public Safety and
Security, the University of Michigan

Police Department and the Ann Arbor
Police Department in executing the
strategy, which included offering alco-
hol-free social events, implementing a
positive public-relations campaign and
limiting marketing of alcohol near cam-
pus.
The strategy also included working
with local vendors to focus their sales
on cans of beer rather than glass bottles,
reducing drink specials and limiting the
overall availability of alcohol in accor-
dance with local and state ordinances.
"The work that we did at the previous

night game was very successful," Jones
said. "Replicating what we did the first
time was really important."
The University also used Neighbor-
hood Ambassadors through the Beyond
the Diag program to reinforce messages
about good sportsmanship, spread news
about University-sponsored events and
advise the community about safe-drink-
ing practices.
"We're trying to have a diverse, wide
array of activities that appeal to differ-
ent students," Jones said.

prepare for ACA

A BLUE LEPRECHAUN

For young people,
parents' coverage
extended to age 26
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
Let's just say it's complicated.
As many provisions of the
Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act - or, Obamacare
- come into effect on Jan. 1, the
University and its students are
preparing for potential changes
to health coverage.
One of the more popular
aspects of the landmark legis-
lation is the requirement that
parental health benefits be
extended to children until the
age of 26. Conversely, individ-
uals without health coverage
will face increasingly steep
penalties for remaining unin-
sured.
"I don't think students, for
the most part, need to know a
lot of the details," Public Health
prof. Richard Hirth, an expert
on the law, said. "However, I
think they do need to know
what their options are."
In 2014 and beyond, students
will be provided with three pri-

mary ways to obtain their health
insurance: through family, the
University or the new exchanges
that the law calls on states to set
up. Previously, most insurance
plans would only cover children
until age 22.
For students wishing to
receive health insurance
through the University, the
existingdomestic student health
insurance plan will remain in
effect. This plan is predicted
to meet the minimum coverage
requirements laid out under the
new law, Hirth said.
In October, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human
Services will open the new
insurance marketplace, com-
monly called healthcare
exchanges, which will allow
uninsured or underinsured
individuals to shop for and pur-
chase health insurance from
one of many partner companies.
Michigan was the 25th state to
pass the legislation. While this
is one of the new features of the
Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act, Hirth said it will
not be as attractive to most stu-
dents.
Exchange plans are limited
in how much they can vary

year term before a nationwide
search for a long-term replace-

Budgetary changes were
made to focus on graduate
rather than undergraduate pro-

Costolo talks to Ross students

Twitter CEO
discusses his time
at the University
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
While students at the business
school were given 100-million
reasons to be happy earlier this
week, Twitter CEO and University
alum Dick Costolo gave them one
more when he participated in the
semester's first fireside chat via
live video feed.
Costolo, who is best known
for his role as the top executive
of Twitter, graduated from the
University in 1985. He went
on to work in consulting and
the technology sector - and
even did a stint in improv
with Second City - before
founding Feedburner, a web
feed management software
company that was later sold to
Google. Costolo briefly worked
for Google before becoming
joining Twitter in 2009 and
becoming interim CEO in 2010

- a role which later evolved into
a permanent position.
Inhistalkatthebusinessschool,
Costolo discussed his time at the
University, sharing stories about
his experiences as a fraternity
brother, a stand-up comedian, a
computer-science major, as well as
the creation of Twitter.
"I think of Twitter as this global
town square," Costolo said.
He added that character limit
placed on tweets allows for a
sense of "honesty" regarding
national and international
incidents.
"That's part of the beauty
of the 140 characters is that
you don't have the sensation
of drafting two paragraphs to
make sure everything is 'just
so,' " he said. "The 140 character
constraint enables you to be real
time and more conversational
and authentic."
He also joked about the
time-consuming nature of the
application as it functions for
many simultaneously as a social
media channel and a news outlet.
"Once you become a core
user of Twitter, it becomes

indispensable to you," he said.
"People talk all the time about
gettingaddictedto Twitter -but
I prefer the term indispensable."
The session was then opened
up to the audience, who asked
their questions via the hashtag
"#UMFiresidechats."
Questions ranged from "name
three singers on your iPod"
(Biggie, Katy Perry, and Lady
Gaga) to name three functions of a
stapler without staples (a hammer,
ameasuringstick, and aprojectile)
When asked for his favorite
thing about the University,
Costolo referenced the feeling of
"humility" despite the school's
greatness.
Engineering graduate student
Marina Vigenattendedthe event
because she hopes to get into the
start-up world after graduation.
"I don't know much about
Twitter as an organization but
I'm really interested in how you
take an initial idea and make it
into something commercially
viable," she said. "Engineering is
very academic and very narrowly
focused and very different than

Congressmen
Dingell and
Walberg attend
grand opening
By SYDNEY BERGER
Daily StaffReporter
Ribbons were cut and
renovations unveiled Friday at
the Veterans' Affairs Ann Arbor
Healthcare System on Fuller
Road, which celebrated the
creation of two state-of-the-art
medical units: a new emergency
department and an inpatient
telemetry unit for military
veterans.
Congressman John D.
Dingell, a WWII veteran, and
Congressman Tim Walberg
joined the gathering of veterans,
hospital employees, volunteers
and more than 150 others to
celebrate the opening of the
30,000-square-foot space.
Dingell said the renovations
were an important project to
ensure that veterans receive
proper care after serving their
country.
"The purpose is to see to it
that the VA hospital system
continues to meet the high
standards that we want the VA

to provide for our veterans in
this superb hospital system,"
Dingell said.
Derek Atkinson, a Marine
Corps veteran and a public
affairs officer at the Department
of Veterans Affairs, opened the
event by introducing invocation
speaker, Chaplain Roland
Schaedig, for a moment of prayer.
Robert P. McDivitt, director
of the VA Ann Arbor Health-
care System and an Army
veteran, said the hospital's
additions are meant to "honor
America's veterans" for the
sacrifices that they've made
for the country.
The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare
System has served more than
60,000 veterans since opening
in 1953.
The renovations are meant
to improve patient access
to quality care. The project,
funded by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009, cost roughly $6.3
million and took about two
years to complete.
"From where we are coming
from to where we are going,
it's just a completely new world
for veterans," clinical nurse
manager Shannon Asperger said.
The current telemetry unit,
which staff said lacked privacy,
will transfer its patients to the

new unit on Sept. 18. The new
unit allows for higher occupan-
cy - adding eight beds to a total
of 28. The new emergency room
department, which is set to open
Sept. 10, will have 18 beds.
Giuseppe V. Del Giudice, who
works in the hospital's eye clinic
and served four years in the
Navy as a hospital corpsman,
said the new additions show for-
ward thinking on the part of the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
"It's a good contrast to see
old and new," Del Giudice said.
"I think that's important for
the community to see - the
progression."
He added: "It's like any
ER you'd see at U of M or any
major big hospital. That's the
unbelievable part."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Rallies held over
possible U.S.
attack in Syria
Opponents and supporters
of U.S. military intervention in
Syria have been holding rallies
across Michigan.
President Barack Obama is
asking for Congress's support to
attack Syria over what he says is
the government's use of chemi-
cal weapons to kill more than
1,400 people.
Several dozen opponents of
a U.S. attack marched through
downtown Detroit for a rally
Sunday at the waterfront Hart
Plaza.
About 30 people opposed to
American military intervention
turned out for a rally Saturday in
Grand Rapids. On Friday, about
100 supporters of an American
military response held a rally in
the Detroit suburb of Birming-
ham.
WASHINGTON
U.S. jobs data
could drive Fed
bond-buying move
Signs of improvement in the
U.S. economy emerged this week,
and the jobs report the govern-
ment will issue Friday will show
whether that strength is fueling
consistent hiring gains.
The August employment
report will be the most sig-
nificant economic data to be
released before the Federal
Reserve meets Sept. 17-18. Many
economists expect the Fed to
decide then to slow its monthly
bond purchases.
Analysts predict a solid gain
of 177,000 jobs for August, above
total but just below the monthly
average this year of 192,000. The
unemployment rate is expected to
remain 7.4 percent.
MOSCOW
Navalnyhas strong
showing in Moscow
mayoral race
Opposition leader Alexei
Navalny swept up far more votes
than expected Sunday while fin-
ishing second in Moscow's may-
oral election, a pivotal contest
that has energized Russia's small
opposition in ways that could
pose a risk to the Kremlin in the
days and years ahead.
Partial results released early
Monday showed Navalny with
about 27 percent of the vote,
while the Kremlin-backed
incumbent, Sergei Sobyanin,
held a clear lead with about 52
percent. Exit polls, however,
predicted Navalny would get as
much as 32 percent.
As the results only began to
trickle out two hours after the
polls closed, Navalny said he sus-
pected the vote count was being
manipulated.

KABUL, Afghanistan
NATO accused
of killing Afghan
civilians
Afghan officials accused
NATO of killing civilians in an
airstrike that left at least 10 dead
in the country's remote east,
while the Taliban on Sunday
staged a car bomb and gun attack
outside an Afghan intelligence
office, killing four soldiers and
wounding more than 80 people.
Meanwhile, the Afghan gov-
ernment reacted angrily to a
comment by an American envoy
who said Afghanistan is already
experiencing "a civil war."
The airstrike and Taliban
attack underscored the chronic
insecurity in Afghanistan as
U.S.-led foreign forces reduce
their presence and hand over
more responsibilities to Afghan
troops. The car bombing
occurred in Maidan Shahr, a city
in eastern Wardak province just
40 kilometers (25 miles) from
Kabul.

gathering, climate
change
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia
(AP) - Touting economic prog-
ress at the Group of 20 summit,
President Barack Obama said
the nation's economic powers no
longer face the threat of a finan-
cial meltdown and can turn their
attention to issues of tax evasion,
job creation and climate change.
"For the first time in three
years, instead of an urgent dis-
cussion to address the European
financial crisis, we see a Europe
that has emerged from reces-
sion," Obama said Friday at a
news conference wrapping up
a three-day European trip that
included the two-day G-20 meet-
ingin St. Petersburg.
Obama was dogged at the
summit by revelations of spying
by the National Security Agency
and held private meetings with
the presidents of Brazil and
Mexico to assure them that his
administration would work to
resolve tensions over allegations
that the NSA monitored their
communications.
After separate sessions with
Mexican President Enrique Pena
Nieto and Brazilian President
Dilma Rousseff, Obama said he
told both leaders that he takes
the allegations of spying on their
communications seriously and
said he promised to address their
concerns.
"What we do is similar to what
countries around the world do
with their intelligence services,"
Obama said. "But what is true is
that, you know, we are bigger. We
have greater capabilities."
He said he wants a review of
intelligence efforts to determine
the costs and benefits. "Just
because we can get information
doesn't necessarily always mean

that we should," he said.
Both Pena Nieto and Rousseff
have expressed outrage over rev-
elations that the NSA kept tabs
on their communications. The
spying was reported by Brazil's
Globo TV, which cited 2012 docu-
ments from NSA leaker Edward
Snowden. Pena Nieto says it
would constitute an illegal act.
Speaking at her own press
conference, Rousseff said Obama
vowed to have a response for her
government by Sept. 11. Rous-
seff said her decision whether to
make a scheduled state visit to
the United States in October will
depend on the "political condi-
tions" set by Obama.
Though the civil war in Syria
and Obama's call for a military
response to chemical weapons
use there dominated much of the
conversation, Obama said the 20
leaders also paid heed to a litany
of issues such as helping foster
growth in emerging economies,
promoting infrastructure and
fighting corruption. He said the
nations agreed to continue with
financial reforms and to address
tax evasion and avoidance that
he says undermines budgets and
shifts the taxburden.
The president spoke after
the U.S. government reported
that the unemployment rate had
dropped to 7.3 percent,the lowest
in nearly five years. But the jobs
picture remained tepid. More
Americans stopped looking for
workandwere no longer counted
as unemployed and the combined
job creation in June, July and
August amounted to the weak-
est three-month stretch of job
growth in a year.
With a confrontation brew-
ing with Congress over raising
the nation's borrowing limit,
Obama warned lawmakers that it
shouldn't risk a U.S. default "over
paying bills we've already racked
up." He said he was determined
that the world has confidence
"in the full faith and credit of the
United States."

NAACP president to step down

Michigan to seek
investors to fund
social programs

Jealous instrumental
in financial growth
of organization
WASHINGTON (AP) -
NAACP President and CEO Ben-
jamin Jealous, who is credited
with boosting finances at the
nation's largest civil rights orga-
nization and helping to stabilize
it, said Sunday that he plans to
step down at the end of the year.
The Baltimore-based Nation-
al Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People said
that its rosters of online activ-
ists and donors have grown tre-
mendously during his five-year
tenure. Jealous was the group's
youngest-ever leader when he
was hired as its president at age
35 in 2008.
In a written statement Sun-
day, Jealous, now 40, said he
plans to pursue teaching at a
university and wants to spend
time with his young family.
"The NAACP has always been
the largest civil rights organiza-
tion in the streets, and today it is
also the largest civil rights orga-
nization online, on mobile and at
the ballot box too," Jealous said.
"I am proud to leave the associa-
tion financially sound, sustain-
able, focused, and more powerful
than ever."
Jealous plans to step down on
Dec. 31. His departure planswere
first reported by USA Today,
which said he was in the first
year of a three-year contract.
Jealous told the newspaper he
also plans to start a political action
committee to raise money to elect
diverse progressive candidates to
public office, though not neces-
sarily only Democrats. During
President Barack Obama's first
campaign, Jealous said he teamed
with others to create a fundraising
group that raised $10 million to
help elect the first black president.
Jealous is credited with
improving the NAACP's financ-
es and donor base over the past

five years. In the year before
Jealous arrived, the NAACP cut
its national staff by a third. Also
that year, former NAACP presi-
dent Bruce Gordon abruptly
resigned because of differences
with the group's 64-member
board.
The group said its donors have
increased from 16,000 people
giving each year to more than
132,000 under his leadership.
During Jealous's tenure,
the NAACP also has embraced
gay rights in a historic vote to
endorse same-sex marriage in
May 2012. "Civil marriage is a
civil right and a matter of civil
law," the group said, citing the
14th Amendment's equal pro-
tection clause.
Jealous told The Associated
Press recently that a broader coali-
tion is needed to fight the civil
rightsbattlesofthe21stcentury.
"Last century we needed law-
yers; this century we need big,
broad coalitions," he said. "When
extremists decide to attack all
our communities, they must
hope that there will be infight-
ing. But we have stood all for one
and one for all. That is how we
will win."
An NAACP spokesman said
Jealous was not available for
an interview until a formal
announcement on Monday.
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, a
civil rights leader and former
president of the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference, said
Jealous brought an intellectual
quality and a level of integrity
that won respect.
"I'm sorry to see him resign,
although I understand he has
other plans. But, I think he was
just getting into his stride," Low-
ery said Sunday evening. "I think
he brought a luster to the office
that was quiet and dignified and
effective, and I wish him well in
his new work."
The Rev. Al Sharpton said
he felt "mixed emotions" about
Jealous' announcement, which
included sadness because Jeal-

ous had led the organization so
well.
"Not only was he able to revive
the NAACP and raise its budget
to higher heights, he joined us
in the streets in real civil rights
activity on the ground," Sharp-
ton said in a written statement.
"From the 'suites to the streets,'
he will be missed as head of the
NAACP, but Iam sure he will not
leave us in his contribution to the
struggle."
Jealous began his career as a
community organizer in Harlem
with the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund. He was suspended from
Columbia University in New York
City after organizing student
protests and went on to work as a
reporter for the Jackson Advocate
newspaper in Mississippi.
Jealous has led the NAACP
to advocate against "stop-and-
frisk" police tactics and stand-
your-ground laws following the
death of Florida teenager Tray-
von Martin. He has also fought to
abolish the death penalty at the
state level, including in Mary-
land.
NAACP Chairman Roslyn
Brock accepted Jealous' resigna-
tion in the past week. She said
the group would continue its
fight to restore part of the Vot-
ing Rights Act that was recently
struck down by the Supreme
Court, as well as work to boost
its civic engagement efforts and
ensure that black Americans are
able to obtain health insurance
under the nation's health care
overhaul.
Brock thanked Jealous for his
service.
"Under his leadership, the
NAACP has built a highly com-
petent staff that will carry our
mission forward and meet the
civil rights challenges of the
21st century," she said. "Our
board, staff and volunteer lead-
ers throughout the country
deeply appreciate his sacrifice
and will continue to implement
our game-changing goals for
the next half century."

Pay-for-success
contract funds
Harvard-based
initiative
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Michigan plans to enlist pri-
vate investors to finance a
public social program, becom-
ing the latest state government
to try an experimental "pay-
for-success" approach in tack-
ling persistent problems such
as homelessness or criminal
recidivism.
The state will announce
Monday that it is the seventh
chosen through a national
competition to receive techni-
cal assistance from Harvard
University for a social impact
bond.
Also known as pay-for-suc-
cess contracts, social impact
bonds work like this: Private
investors - potentially a bank
and a philanthropic foundation
- put up money for a program
with a specific goal. A contract
is signed with a service pro-
vider.
If the goal is achieved, the
government pays back the
investors, with a profit. If not,
the government pays nothing.
"We believe it makes govern-
ment delivery of services more
accountable. If it's successful,
we benefit. If for whatever rea-
son the targets aren't met, tax-
payers aren't on the hook for
those dollars," said Joe Pavona,
special adviser for public-pri-
vate partnerships to Gov. Rick
Snyder.
The state will issue a request
for information Monday to
identify potential projects.
Some possibilities men-
tioned by Pavona include

infant mortality, early child-
hood development, homeless-
ness and recidivism. But he
said the Snyder administration
could settle on something else
depending on feedback from
potential investors and service
providers.
The Harvard Kennedy
School will send a full-time fel-
low to Michigan for a year to
help launch the initiative, with
support from the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Laura
and John Arnold Foundation.
After helping Massachusetts
and New York become the first
state governments to develop
pay-for-success contracts using
social impact bonds, Harvard
held a competition to award
assistance to other govern-
ments.
Six winners out of 28 appli-,
cants were announced in June.
The school added Michigan
after finding more funding
because it was among a hand-
ful of other "really strong"
applications, said Jeffrey Lieb-
man, a public policy profes-
sor at Harvard who directs
the university's Social Impact
Bond Technical Assistance
Lab.
He said the No. 1 criteria in
choosing a state was the com-
mitment of its leaders to follow
through.
"If we work with a state for
a year to put together a project,
we want them to actually do it,"
Liebman said.
Social impact bonds began
in Britain. The first U.S. gov-
ernment to put one together
was New York City, which
announced a year ago that
Goldman Sachs would invest
almost $10 million in a city jail
program to keep inmates ages
16-18 from reoffending.

Shifting the burden
New sexual misconduct policy gives more responsibility to 'U'
University officials enacted a new policy regarding student sexual
misconduct allegations, changing the way the University inves-
tigates sexual harassment and assault accusations. In response
to a 2011 mandate from the Department of Education, colleges across the
country are revisiting their sexual misconduct policies in order to be com-
pliant with Title IX, the federal statute that bans sexual discrimination.
After two years of planning, the University's new approach to sexual mis-
conduct investigations puts more responsibility on University investiga-
tors rather than the student who reported the crime. The policy changes
are a step in the right direction, as they place a greater burden on the Uni-
versity to investigate sexual misconduct on campus. But with new poli-
cies come new potential misunderstandings, and the University needs to
clearly explain what these changes mean for students - especially when
it comes to confidentiality.

When McDonald's moved toward

The revised protocol modifies the model for
sexual-misconduct investigations, bringing
University officials from multiple departments
together in an attempt to connect survivors
with appropriate services. Under the finalized
policy, once an incident of sexual misconduct
is reported, the survivor is then directed to
campus support services, such as Counseling
and Psychological Services or staff from the
Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter. The University then determines if a more
direct intervention is needed - such as mov-
ing a student from a particular residence hall or
class. The accuser can also refuse to meet with
investigators, though ultimately the Univer-
sity's Title IX coordinator may choose to con-
tinue the investigation without that person's
cooperation. The newly outlined investigation
process also makes a special note to keep inter-
views with the survivor and the accused sepa-
rate. "We ask follow-up questions based on the
information we have," Anthony Walesby, senior
director of the office of Institutional Equality,
said. "But you never have to worry about being
in the same room as the person you are accusing
and vice versa." Furthermore, University inves-
tigators will use alower standard of proof when
determining guilt.
Ultimately, these changes place less of a
burden on accusers, signaling the University's

resolve in addressing sexual misconduct on
campus and reducing its impact. Reporting sex-
ual misconduct can be difficult for survivors,
and the University's more organized response
to such allegations may help those people to feel
more comfortable when disclosing what can be
very personal information.
One noticeable change in the policy is who
offers confidentiality. Only three Univer-
sity groups - SAPAC, CAPS and the Office of
Ombuds - offer full confidentiality. Residential
advisers and University staff are instructed to
go to a Title IX coordinator. SAPAC director
Holly Rider-Milkovich said first-year students
have been informed "multiple times" about
this change. While we applaud that action, she
also says that she "hopes" students make an
informed choice on who to report sexual mis-
conduct to. It's absolutely critical that the Uni-
versity and groups like SAPAC communicate
this change in confidentiality to students. It's
unreasonable to assume that all students will
be aware of this change themselves.
Sexual misconduct is a forefront problem
on college campuses. It's up to the universities
to assume the burden of these investigations.
The University should be commended for
making this change. However, its impact can
only occur if there's a buy-in from the entire
University community.

MICHAEL CHRZAN I
Ross's 'philanthropy'

I have a story to tell you. As a campus tour
guide, this story is one of my favorites to tell
while givingtours at the University:
"In 2008, a donation of $50 million was
made to the University of Michigan's School of
Business by Stephen M. Ross and was to fund
building renovations. However, the dean of the
school at the time went back to Ross and told
him while that donation was greatly appreci-
ated, they could really use $100 million. Ross
told the dean, if you give me one good reason,
I'll double my donation.
Excited, the dean went back to brainstorm
with faculty, administrators and students alike.
No one came up with a good reason for the big-
ger donation. The dean returned to Ross and told
him the only reason they could think of was out
of the goodness of his heart. So, as any good and
successful Michigan alum would, Ross doubled
his gift.
After the building was renovated, the dean
took Ross on a tour of the building, where MBA
students chanted, 'Thank you, Ross!' and fol-
lowed it with 'The Victors.' Ross was moved to
tears and was reported later saying, 'If they had
asked for another $100 million, I would've given
it right then and there."'
Of course, some of this may not exactly be the
whole truth. However, if it is true, no one can say
he isn't a man of hisword. Last Wednesday, Ross
donated $200 million to the Athletic Depart-
ment and the business school, which has borne
his name since his 2008 donation. This donation
is the largestcin the University's history.
But, what do we do with all that money?
The answer to what is planned for the money
can be found in Sam Gringlas's article in The
Michigan Daily "Gift benefits high-profile
departments" where he states, "Though Ross's
$200-million donation will endow some finan-
cial scholarships, a priority Coleman and other
administrators have repeatedly emphasized
for the next capital campaign, it will also fund
upgrades at the Business School and athletic
campus." This donation will benefit the Univer-
sity and its students.
Yet, I and many others on this campus feel
that if he truly wanted to benefit the University
community, there were better places to do it
than a department that generates alot of revenue
already and one of the topbusiness schools in the

country. As president of the student-education-
reform group, rEDesign, I know other places
both on this campus and in this area that could
have used help from Ross's philanthropy.
However, I also empathize with Ross's dedi-
cation to the communities he was a part of in
his time at Michigan. It's natural to want to give
back to the communities that gave to you. But,
considering all of these sides of this situation
- and the fact that Ross has joined the Giving
Pledge, a commitment of the super-wealthy to
give away almost half their net worth - I pres-
ent a challenge to the "self-described academi-
cally average transfer student" and any future
donors to this University.
If the true end goal of Ross's philanthropy
here at the University is to make this experi-
ence better for the students, then he should
donate to programs that could use the money
to help better the entire campus community.
Donate to programs such as MESA to help
build a new multicultural center closer to
the center of campus so we can truly empha-
size and deliver upon our commitment to
diversity, something that has been a consis-
tent struggle for the University in the recent
decade. Donate to other schools, such as the
School of Education, whose graduates will
be going into service-based fields and may
wind up making less than some citizens with
high school degrees. These low earnings for
important jobs means that graduates from
the schools may not be able to have the phil-
anthropic power you do to help them remodel
their facilities. Donate to Services for Stu-
dents with Disabilities, to help make our cam-
pus even more accessible for any student who
wants to come to this world-class university
in this one-of-a-kind town. Donate to make a
difference, not just an impact.
I believe that most students are grateful for
Ross and for all the amazing alumni who con-
tinue to make the Michigan Difference mean
something anytime they give back to make our
experiences better. However, we're also criti-
cal, in that we want those donations to make
the largest positive difference they can for our
community. Larger, shinier buildings just can't
make that happen.

tion-and-answer format. Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
announced in April that she will
retire in July 2014. Regent Lau-
rence Deitch (D-Bloomfield
Hills) said in a statement that he
hopes to hear from students, fac-
ulty, staff, alumni, community
members and others willing to
attend.
Regents and other members of
the Search Advisory Committee
will attend every session, along
with Alison Ranney, a search
consultant from Russell Reyn-
olds Associates, the executive
recruiting firm appointed to lead
the search, who will answer ques-
tions about the search process
itself.
Regent Katherine White (D-
Ann Arbor), who served on the
2002 presidential committee
with Deitch and Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor),
coordinated the public meetings
on behalf of the board. She said in
the press release that the various
locations and times of the meet-
ings should "allow for the broad-
est input possible."
Since the 2002 search com-
mittee included two students,
University alum Matt Nolan,
then-Michigan Student Assembly
(the former name of the Central
Student Government) president,
and University alum Lisa Jackson,
then a doctoral student of psy-
chology, some students expected
similar representation this time
around.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, Central Student Gov-
ernment president, just advocat-
ed for student representation on
the committee before the deci-
sion was made not to include it.
Since then, Proppe said he has
worked with White, Dean of
Students Laura Blake Jones and
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent of student affairs, to ensure
that students will contribute to
the process.
In an e-mail interview, Proppe
wrote that a lot of Central Student
Government members plan to
attend the public forum on Sept.
26. The group will encourage
other student organization lead-
ers to attend and participate in
the discussion as well.
While Proppe could only spec-
ulate as to why there's no student

premiums - the amount a per-
son is charged with up-front
for coverage. While some plans
are allowed to charge younger
people less, the lower cost still
overvalues the real cost of cov-
erage for the younger - and
generally healthier - popula-
tion.
"You're essentially going to
be paying a premium that's sub-
sidizing the 63-year-olds on the
plan," Hirth said.
In contrast, the student plan
groups its members into an
independent risk pool, mean-
ing student premiums only need
to support other students, not
elderly populations.
However, students can only
maintain insurance through

the University while enrolled,
meaning many must obtain
their own insurance upon
graduation. The exchanges
will likely be a main resource
for students to maintain health
insurance coverage if they
do not already have coverage
through their family.
"At that point I think it is
useful for people to know about
their exchanges and the types
of plans that are available,"
Hirth said. "Because once they
leave the student plan, that's
probably where they're going
to go."
The new law eliminates the
annual coverage cap previously
seen in many insurance plans. In
the past, very few students have
exceeded the $1 million cap pro-
vided under the University plan.
 Other universities with lower
caps - some between $100,000
and $200,000 - will be more
affected by this change, Hirth
said.
Individuals who fail to
obtain health insurance after
Jan. 1 will face new penalties.
For 2014, the penalty is set at
the greater of $95 per adult or
1 percent of taxable income,
according to the Michigan
Department of Insurance and
Financial Services. However,

representation on the committee,
he wrote that he believes there
may have been concerns that stu-
dents would breach confidential-
ity by publicizing the identity of a
presidential candidate.
"I believe the regents are mak-
ing a mistake," Proppe wrote. "So
we the students are going to have
to take it upon ourselves to make
sure the regents have significant
input from students. It will lead to
a more rewardingsearch."
Proppe wrote that he hopes
the next president will continue
to show an interest in student
life and focus on lowering tuition
costs for students.
Regent White will speak to
CSG's University Council Mon-
day to give a more detailed expla-
nation as to why students will
not hold concrete positions on
the committee as well as pos-
sible solutions to increase student
input.
The 16-person search com-
mittee is made up of the eight
regents and eight faculty mem-
bers, including Professors Alec
Gallimore, Timothy Johnson,
Tiya Miles, Rebecca Scott and
David Ginsburg; Jeffrey MacK-
ie-Mason, dean of the School of
Information; and Associate Prof.
Lynn Perry Wooten.
While some meetings will be
directed at specific groups - such
as faculty, staff and specific cam-
pus communities - all meetings
will be open to the public:
-Sept. 17, 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.:

sity Center, UM-Flint campus,

the penalty grows to $325 or 2
percent of income in 2015 and
$695 or 2.5 percent of income
in 2016.
Laurie Burchett, the Univer-
sity's student insurance man-
ager, said the new law is still
unclear - especially regarding
the exchanges - to many health-
care providers and individuals
around the nation.
"There are a lot of unknowns,
and you can't really go (to the
exchange) right now to take a
look at what is available," Bur-
chett said.
According to Burchett, stu-
dents on the University's domes-
tic health insurance plan will be
covered nationwide, while those
on a parent's plan may only be
covered for emergency medical
needs while away from their area
of residence.

For students with limited local
coverage, University Health Ser-
vices offers many medical ser-
vices to students, such as clinic
visits, most laboratory tests and
nutrition counseling, the cost of
which is covered by the student
health service fee and is included
in tuition.
Asked about changes in
healthcare coverage on cam-
pus, many students declined
to comment, citing little or
no knowledge of the changes.
LSA freshman Brady Reeves
said health care is not an issue
that he has ever heard about
on campus, and that few stu-
dents concern themselves
with intricacies of the new
laws.
"I feel it's not really that talk-
ed about," Reeves said. "I don't
really worry about it because
I know my parents have good
health insurance."
Receiving coverage through
his parents, LSA sophomore
Francis Buggia said he does not
expect his health care to change
in the coming months.
"There's probably good infor-
mation out there," Buggia said.
"But there's a lot of hearsay too
- alot of uninformed people tell-
ing other people what isn't nec-
essarily true."

EVENTS
From Page 1A
Jones added that when the
University was first consider-
ing whether to have night games
at all, the longer time available
in the day for students to drink
was a prime consideration. A
2008 report from the University
of Colorado, Denver stated that
incidents of disorderly conduct,
assaults and vandalism increase
on college game days at Divi-
sion I schools, and Jones said
that, nationally, incidence rates
increase with later start times.
However, in the 2011 Notre
Dame-Michigan game, the inci-
dent rate was on par with an aver-
age game that started at noon.
Events kicked off on Friday
night with the "Maize Out. Lights
On." pep rally in the Diag. Thou-
sands of students attended the
event over the course of the eve-
ning to hear performances from
campus groups and more than a
few pep talks. Guests included
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, Football head coach
Brady Hoke, Heisman Trophy
winner Desmond Howard and
even "Glee" star Darren Criss, a
Michigan alum.

"There is no place in the world
like the University of Michigan -
anywhere," Criss said to roaring
applause.
On Saturday morning, more
than 1,000 of the most dedicated
Wolverines rose before the sun
to cheer for their team at ESPN's
College GameDay.
This is the second time in
three years that ESPN broadcast-
ed its College GameDay program
from Ann Arbor, and the 23rd
time Michigan has been featured
overall.
The show included appear-
ances from the University's
cheerleading and dance teams, as
well as sporadic performances of
"The Victors" from the Michigan
Marching Band.
Signs reading "Rudy was off-
sides" and "My girlfriend is real"
- in reference to former Notre
Dame player Manti Te'o's infa-
mous fake-girlfriend debacle
- were prominently displayed
throughout the event. A seem-
ingly lost Ohio State fan, decked
out in scarlet and gray, was booed
continuously throughout the
morning.
Sean Hanrahan, senior vice
president of marketing solutions
for ESPN, said though College
GameDay offers a different expe-

rience at each campus, the Uni-
versity offers a great location to
host the show.
"For excitement and pag-
eantry and good television, this
seems like a really good loca-
tion," Hanrahan said.
University students began lin-
ing up for front-row seats to the
show at about 9 p.m. Friday. By 7
a.m., the broadcasting area set-up
by ESPN was full, well before the
9 a.m. live filmingofthe show.
Engineering junior Corey
Greenawalt, who began camp-
ing out on the lawn at 10 p.m.
Friday with three of his friends,
was one of the first students in
line. He said he was most excit-
ed to see Howard and co-host
Lee Corso.
"It was a lot of fun camping out
and getting pumped up ... we all
couldn't wait," Greenwalt said.
Although the vast majority of
attendees to all of the weekend's
events were clad in maize and
blue, a few Fighting Irish turned
out to support Notre Dame.
"I love this game, it's my favor-
ite game of the year," said Notre
Dame senior Anna VanEgmond.
"I'm sad they're taking it off the
schedule."
This year, University Police
made 11 arrests for various vio-

lations, 10 citations for alcohol
in the stadium and 50 ejections
from Michigan Stadium before,
during and after the game. Emer-
gency medical personnel treated
133 people, with 21 taken to the
University Hospital for further
care. A record 115,109 people
attended the game.
While 8,000 students attended
the Central Student Government
tailgate two years ago, verified
from M-Card swipes upon entry,
CSG President Michael Proppe
estimated that only 1,500 stu-
dents attended this year's event.
He ascribed the low attendance
to inclement weather during
parts of the afternoon and the
new general-admission policy.
"With General Admission
seating, many students would
prefer to hold their spot in line,
where there was also free pizza
and a DJ, rather than hang out at
a tailgate on Elbel," Proppe wrote
in an e-mail interview.
Though she thought the CSG
tailgate was well-planned -
complete with a mechanical bull
and free food - LSA sophomore
Rachael Lacey said the low turn-
out surprised her: Elbel Field
had more family tailgaters than
students when she was there,
she said.


LIGHTS
From Page 1A
game in three years - people
seemed to know what they were
doing. Yes, there were people
passed out before lunchtime and
some people in the Big House
who were struggling to handle
their liquor, but for the most part,
the vibe was different than it was
two years ago. It wasn't the first
time in 131 years that Michigan
played a home game at night, but
it could very well be the last one in
the foreseeable future, and every-
one knew that.
There are times in the Big
House when all the bells and
whistles feel forced and out of
place. Saturday was not one of
those times.
Just like the Athletic Depart-
ment wanted, the student section
was full, and it was full early. It
was packed and roped off, to the
point where students complained
about not having enough room,
but that was forgotten by kickoff.
There was a flyover before the
game, which was similar to a fly-
over in the same way that a Honda
Civic is similar to a Lamborghini.
At halftime, Beyoncd apologized
for not being able to make it -

Queen Bey apologized for not
being in the Big House - before
finishingher video message with a
"Go Blue." Then, complete with a
lights show, the Michigan March-
ing Band proceeded to perform
a few of Beyonce's hits with the
lights off. Not exactly atraditional
show, but one that matched the
situation note for note. Plain and
simple, it was just cool.
Saturday would have been spe-
cial even if the game was awful,
which of course it wasn't, because
there's no situation in which
Notre Dame and Michigan could
play a boring game. Before Sat-
urday, the past five games were
decided by a touchdown or less,
and three were determined in the
final 30 seconds.
Notre Dame got into the game
with a touchdown that came off
a deflection into the back of the
end zone. Michigan ended the
game with an interception that
deflected off a defender's foot. In
between, fifth-year senior wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon and red-
shirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner touched greatness, if
only for one game.
Wearing Legacy jerseys -
Gardner wearing Tom Harmon's
No. 98 and Gallon wearing Des-
mond Howard's No. 21 - theetwo

combined for almost 200 yards
and three touchdowns. Harmon's
son, Mark, was in attendance for
the pregame ceremony. Howard
was in attendance. Past and pres-
ent, under the lights, one more
time.
This week or next, maybe even
today, there will be a debilitating
realization that the Wolverines
are replacing the Fighting Irish
on their schedule with UNLV and
that there won't be an Under the
Lights III for a long, longtime.
In 2015, we get UNLV, along
with BYU and Oregon State, all of
them during the day, and none of
them with any sort of historic sig-
nificance. Michigan hasn't played
BYU or Oregon State since the
1980s and has never played UNLV.
Maybe the Wolverineswill play
another night game in the future,
and maybe they will convince
Beyonce to show up in real life
instead of just on the video board.
It could be as amazing as Saturday
was, who knows, butI doubt it.
Before the game, the video
boards showed highlights of for-
mer greats, people like Harmon
and Howard. Future generations
will see Gallon's performance
playing on those screens, but
there will be no highlights of Ore-
gon State or BYU.

You can blame whoever you
want for that, but the bottom line
is that it's truly a shame we won't
get an Under the Lights IIL
On ESPN's Football GameDay
on Saturday morning, analyst Lee
Corso showed a clip of Michigan
coach Brady Hoke saying over the
summer that Notre Dame "chick-
ened out" of the rivalry game
before donning a green hat and
producing four live chickens. It
wasn't win one for the Gipper - it
was win one for the chicken.
"I don't think we took it per-
sonally," Hoke said after the game.
"We were playing Notre Dame.
I'm going back to the Michigan
teams I coached on as an assis-
tant. There are just certain games
you get very excited about, those
rivalry games. I don't think there
was any kind of anger ... we just
wanted to win."
That mattered on Saturday.
All those people, 115,109 of them,
knew it was the last time they
would see things like Gardner to
Gallon dominating one the best
rivalries in college football, the
shadows of Harmon, Howard and
rivalries of old somewhere off in
the distance.

RENOVATIONS
From Page 1A
cifically, the $110 million grad-
uate dorm set to open in 2015
thanks to an historic donation
by Charles Munger.
The lack of upperclassmen
- juniors occupied just 8 per-
cent of dorm rooms in 2012
- does not, however, indi-
cate a lack of graduate stu-
dents interested in dorm life.
In 2005, the last year before
housing renovations eliminat-
ed scores of University beds,
12 percent of housing resi-
dents were graduates.
Logan attributes these ratios
to undergraduates' desire to live
off-campus after their expe-
rience in University dorms.
Graduate students, on the other
hand, are still adjusting to a new
city and classmates.
"Graduate students are open
to campus housing that provides
an affordable location and social
connection with other grads,"
Logan said.
Two of the five Northwood
communities on North Campus
are exclusively graduate dorms.
Northwood IV and V offer one-
to three-bedroom homes and
on-site child care for gradu-
ate students with families. The
only existing graduate hous-
ing option on Central Campus,
however, is the newly renovated
Lawyers Club, which accommo-
dates about 260 law students.
Diane Nafranowicz, director
of the Lawyers Club, said more
than half of the incoming class
opts to live in one of the single
rooms.
New law students typically
spend their summer prior to
enrollment conducting research
or studying abroad, making a
housing search difficult, Naf-
ranowicz said.
Law students are also rela-
tively new to the University.
Not unlike undergraduate

freshmen, first-year graduate
students lack the social con-
nections to find group homes
and apartments, and they're
not familiar with Ann Arbor's
housing stock.
"A grad student who comes
for the first time has many
shared experiences with any
student who comes for the first
time," Nafranowicz said.
After living at the Lawyers
Club for their first year, she said
most law students move off-
campus for their second and
third years.
Since 2005, however, gradu-
ate students have lost some
of their on-campus housing
options to undergraduates,
as facilities such as Couzens,
Alice Lloyd, East Quad and,
most recently, South Quad Res-
idence Halls undergo renova-
tions.
The renovations delegated
three out of the five Northwood
communities, spaces tradition-
ally for graduates, as under-
graduate housing. Northwood
III is reserved exclusively for
freshmen.
In fact, graduate participa-
tion in housing dipped from 12
percent in 2005 to 9 percent
last year, when East Quad and
the Lawyers Club were closed
for remodeling. Presently,
Logan said, there's a shortage
of housing for graduate stu-
dents.
Renovations have also slight-
ed older undergraduates. Tra-
ditionally, those who have lived
in housing the longest, like
Holland, had priority choice in
housing. This advantage is now
given to students who have lived
in housing the shortest time,
such as returning sophomores.
As usual, freshmen are guar-
anteed housing but cannot pick
their dorm.
Renovations have left junior
and senior participation in
housing largely unaffected.
For example, the percentage

of upperclassmen in housing
is identical for 2005, the year
before renovations began, and
2012, the most recent year with
data during renovations. In the
years between, numbers were
largely similar.
Residence hall closings
proved led to higher participa-
tion for sophomores: In 2005,
when older students had more
freedom in choosing their hous-
ing, 24 percent of the housing
community was made up of sec-
ond-year undergraduates. It was
27 percent last year.
Upperclassmen participa-
tion in housing is low com-
pared to other institutions.
Ninety-seven percent of Har-
vard University students live
on campus for all four years.
Harvard students typically
remain in one house - dorms
that house between 350 and
450 students - after freshmen
year. Each house bears unique
traditions; one storms campus
once per year led by someone
in a penguin suit.
Closer to home, slightly
fewer upperclassmen at Michi-
gan State University return to
housing than at Michigan. MSU
communications manager Kat
Cooper said about 43 percent
of the housing population was
made of sophomores through
seniors compared to 49 percent
of Michigan's housing popula-
tion. Cooper said MSU encour-
ages students to return, but
recognizes East Lansing's capa-
bility to house its upperclass-
men.
East Lansing bears similar-
ity to Ann Arbor, which has
enough housing for the 18,000
undergraduates who live off-
campus. Logan, the Univer-
sity Housing spokesperson,
explained that other campus
communities often lack afford-
able and convenient off-campus
housing.
Additionally, students at cer-
tain colleges are required to

live on-campus for their first
year, and sometimes their sec-
ond. MSU requires students to
live in residence halls fresh-
man year, as does Harvard. The
University does not have such
a requirement. Students may
also live in University housing
all four years simply by cus-
tom. Logan noted that students
typically venture off-campus as
upperclassmen.
Logan said the University
supports those upperclassmen
who choose stay on campus
while prioritizing freshmen,
who generally require the most
support.
"The incoming freshman
needs the residential support
more than any other student in
order to acclimate to univer-
sity life," Logan said. "Lifelong
friendships are created in that
first freshmen experience on
campus."
Logan said housing is excited
to offer that community support
for graduates in the soon-to-
come residence hall, similar to
one Munger financed at Stan-
ford University. Graduates will
live in suites of up to seven other
students from various disci-
plines, providing collaborative
living and the single rooms that
graduates seek.
And such community exists
for upperclassmen like Hol-
land, who keeps his door open
and chats up his East Quad hall-
mates. Along with the dining
halls and proximity to classes,
Holland enjoys the halls' quan-
tity of people and his informal
mentoring role as an older stu-
dent.
"It's less of what can the
dorms do for me, but more about
how can I reach out to people,"
Holland said in his hall's lounge,
where Beyonce was blasting
from a nearby room. "How can
I meet them, befriend them,
impact someone's life simply
by knowing the ropes, knowing
what people go through?"

Stop calling
Walter White an
anti-hero

ince Gilligan's "Breaking
Bad" is well into its final
season, and the Internet
is alive with a general sentiment
of "WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
DO WITH-
OUT IT?"
I'm among
the many
"Bad" fans
unprepared
to let go. But
first, I have
a few things KAYLA
I want to say UPADHYAYA
about Walter
White and
why I cringe every time I read a
tweet along the lines of "Heisen-
berg is such a boss!"
Early on, I viewed "Breaking
Bad" as another player in the
anti-hero game. As the show tore
through its explosive are, I start-
ed to understand it more as a
critique of "anti-hero" television.
Critics love to draw comparisons
between Walt and the iconic
anti-hero Tony Soprano (argu-
ably the man to spark the trend),
but place them side-by-side and
you'll see that they function in
entirely different ways. After
the series-defining fifth episode
of the show, when we see Tony
kill a man with his bare hands in
between college tours with his
daughter Meadow, there's little
doubt that Tony's a murderous
monster, capable of inflicting
harm upon everyone around him
in an unflinching, almost mun-
dane fashion. But when you look
at Tony's ongoing character are
throughout the series, it's flecked
with crises of conscience and
moments of moral clarity. Tony
was knowable, even charming
at times, defined by boring little
humanizing qualities we all
have.
That's been the general formu-
la for most TV anti-heroes today.
Their creators push them as far
as they can into corruption and
villainy and then snap them back
with moments of vulnerability or
selflessness or compassion. "Mad
Men"'s Don Draper manipulates,
cheats, neglects. But he's also
haunted by death and pain, and
it'd be hard to build a case that
Don's a villain.
Walt's story moves differ-
ently. It isn't marked by the same
kind of moral oscillation of Tony
or Don. The most commonly
used descriptor in any review,
interviewor conversation about
Walter White is "chemistry
teacher turned meth maker." On
the surface level, it's a correct
assessment of the character's
trajectory. But it also reiterates
this somewhat misguided notion
that Walt underwent a complete
character transformation with
his occupation change. People
love to talk about Walt's "turning
point." When was the moment
when Walter White truly broke
bad? For some, it's when he mur-
ders Krazy 8. For many, it's when
he lets Jane die.
I don't see Walt's journey in
terms of a turning point or a
transformation. It's more accu-
rately characterized as a linear
descent that sometimes varies in
how fast it plummets but never
deviates from course. We're not
watching a hero lose his way.
We're watching a villain's origin
story and, as the eerily apocalyp-
tic flash forwards insinuate, his
eventual demise.

I can't pointto one murder or
lie or twisted manipulation and
say: "There. That's where Walt
crossed the line into unredeem-
able territory." You have to zoom
out to see that all of his wicked
actions compound, as Heisenberg
tears through his path of destruc-
tion, pulling others along with
him. You can sit down and tally
up everyone he has killed, lied
to, or hurt, but you still wouldn't
be quantifying his villainy. How
could you? Like any great villain,
Walt operates in insidious ways.
When Walt refuses to let his
longtime friend Elliott pay for
his medical bills - which would
effectively give him an out of the
drug biz - he's showing the true
colors of his relentless hubris.
Jesse may have pulled the trig-
ger, but Walt is just as culpable

t

for Gale's death, and not only
because he gave the order. Up
until Gale's execution, we always
understood Jesse as the quasi-
moral compass of the duo, simply
because he seemed incapable
of murder. Jesse was always
uncomfortable with any of Walt's
plans that involved taking life.
But Jane's death changed Jesse.
He blamed himself, became
convinced he was a Bad Guy, and
self-fulfilled the prophecy by
showing up on Gale's doorstep.
And Jane's death goes right back
to Walt. Hank's life started spin-
ning out of control at the hands
of Walt when he was still just the
elusive, mythical Heisenberg to
the DEA agentbrother-in-law.
And now that Hank knows the
truth, he's descending further
into his obsession with trapping
Walt, manipulating Marie, Skyler
and Jesse in the process. I don't
wish to argue thatthe characters
on "BreakingfBad" - who are all
flawed in real, textured ways -
aren't responsible for their own
actions. I'm just saying that Walt
has a hand in almost everything
"bad" that happens on the show.
The defining, noxious qualities
that make Heisenberg the terror
he is were always in Walt, just
under the surface. In an early epi-
sode, we learn that Walt's former
business venture Gray Matter
Technologies achieved huge suc-
cess after Walt sold his share of
the company. His partners made
millions while Walt walked away
with nothing. Even though it has
been decades, Walt confesses to
Jesse that he checks the com-
pany's valuations weekly, tortur-
ing himself with what could have
been. That's obsessive behavior.
Walt's obsession, pride, megalo-
mania - they didn't magically
appear when he stopped being a
chemistry teacher. These traits
just heightened when mixed with
the high-stakes chemicals of the
meth industry.
Heisenberg is
officially the
Big Bad of
this show.
Think about it: Walt's most
empathetic characteristic is his
cancer, and that has nothingto
do with who he is as a person. It's
just a condition that, yes, impacts
and informs some of his actions,
but it's not a human quality. In
fact, he sometimes uses his can-
cer as a weapon to control others,
like when he uses his relapse
to earn Walter Jr.'s sympathy.
If you're still convinced that
Walt's top priority is his family,
you're just as delusional as he is.
The cancer diagnosis triggered
something potent within him: a
desire to live. But that desire is
only partly about protecting his
family and mostly about preserv-
ing his own legacy. Have you ever
heard Walt describe himself as a
family man or a loving husband
or a caring father? No, he's in the
empire business. He is the one
who knocks. He is the danger.
Walter White is not an anti-
hero, so let's not call him one.
It suggests that he's deserving
of our laud and empathy. Call

him what he really is: evil. Gil-
ligan has geniusly made his
protagonist a villain, offering a
critique - an antidote, even - of
the anti-hero trope. As view-
ers, we still want to root for the
protagonist, because that's what
television has conditioned us to
do for so long, which is why so
many "Bad" fans end up cheer-
ing for the sociopathic drug lord
and viciously hating his trapped
wife. This final season has made
it all the more clear that we
really don't have any heroes on
"Breaking Bad." Gilligan trick-
ing us into believing we ever did
is a manipulation of Heisenberg
proportions.

pay for her post-'Bad' therapy. To

'Sunny' crosses a dark
line in season nine

By EMILY BODDEN
Daily Arts Writer
"It's Always Sunny in Phila-
delphia" returned on its new net-
work, FXX for its ninth season, a
feat that hope-
fully proves B-

The season premiere
opened with
"The Gang Wednesdays

As selfish and
snarky as in pre- FXX
vious seasons,
the episode pushed the levels of
comfort. By now, audiences know
to expect dark humor stemming
from the few redeeming qualities
that each character possesses, but
season nine pushes the envelope.
Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson)
takes center stage, but not in
the way we expect. Instead of
her usual sharp self, Dee has
reached a mental breaking point
that causes the gang to decide to
rehabilitate her using their own
means. While the episode pres-
ents some of its usual laugh out
loud, or at very least, chuckle-
producing humor, more than a
few suicide jokes arise.
Dark humor is one thing, but
suicide jokes take the show into
new territory. Though com-
edy pushes comfort barriers and
norms, suicide seems an extreme-

Vin Diesel is his
typical juiced-up
self in action flick
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
There is no way more boring
to describe a movie than, well, it
gets the job done. When it comes
to "Riddick,"
getting the job B
done is really
all this no-non- Riddick
sense thrill ride
needs with its At Quality6
knuckle-bear- and Rave
ing violence Universal
and more than
a few visual
flourishes. For fans of "The
Chronicles of Riddick" franchise,
this newest entry represents the
titular anti-hero's return to form
in more ways than one. He is the
savage we remember from "Pitch
Black," a brute who has more in
common with his surrounding
hellscapes than he does people,
who has finally gotten back in
touch with his wild roots.
Riddick, played by the always
guttural Vin Diesel ("Fast &
Furious 6"), has just been uncer-
emoniously relieved of his com-
mand of the Necromongers and
dropped on a nameless piece of
rock. There he adopts an alien
canine companion (Why is it
that animals always steal the
scene?) and settles back into his
old ways of fighting each day for
survival. It's a grim, brutal exis-
tence.
one day he and his "dog"
spot, on the red-dusted horizon,
the clouds of a storm driving to
them. Its meaning is apparent:
The party is over. In a clever
move, he triggers an emergency
signal to lure any listening mer-
cenaries to join in on his dying
soiree - to steal their ship. A

team arrives for Riddick's head.
Another possessing a dark past
arrives for what's in Riddick's
head. And so ensues the mad-
ness and campy dialogue that
we expect.
Part of what makes sci-fi a
dope genre is its ability to serve
as a cultural space to mash
genres together in unexpected
ways. "Blade Runner" and "Dark
City" mixed in elements of noir
and for all you reading people,
"The Brief Wondrous Life of
Oscar Wao," an exercise in magi-
cal realism, illustrated the hard-
ships of Dominican-American
diaspora through sci-fi. Innova-
tions here are none. "Riddick"
focuses instead on that horror
sci-fi niche it dug out with "Pitch
Black" back in 2000. Therein
lies the paradox: Where "Rid-
dick" goes wrong is its deviation
from that purity.
Writer-director David Twohy
("A Perfect Getaway") flirts
with Christian theology more
than "Riddick" had to, more
than it needed to - more than
it should've. He puppeteers a
prayer-spewing innocent to
work in spiritual insight, and it's
lame - lamer still when Riddick
preaches back his own tough
gospel, "God don't want nothing
to do with this." (I paraphrase.)
Anti-heroes fascinate us for
their conflation and inversion
of what it means to be a sinner
and what it takes to be a saint.
Throwing such obvious dis-
course in our face comes off as
sideline attempts to character-
ize Riddick. There is indeed
something of a character arc in
this anti-hero, and this is not
the ham-fisted direction I think
Twohy should go.
That said, the script does veer
off and delve into a sidestory
from "Pitch Black" that dangles
in front of Riddick a form of
redemption: Mere leader Boss
Johns, played with surprising

charisma by Matt Nable ("The
Final Winter"), needs answers
and he expects Riddick to give
them to him. This digression
was an appreciable effort and
not distracting.
I have to say much of the CGI
worked. At times, the scenery
has a painterly quality with
all the desolation of a Cormac
McCarthy novel and the crea-
tures risen slithering from the
mud are truly grotesque. Other
times, however, the aliens are
sucked of all flesh, bone and
blood. They're dehydrated and
weightless and lack danger and
life. And sometimes, the scenery
just screams blue screen. Memo-
ries of the infamously bad sets of
the "Star Wars" prequel trilogy
came back to me as I watched
grimacing.
My grimacing would not end
either with the overwritten vul-
garity of the script. At one point,
another merc named Santana
says something to the effect of,
"I don't appreciate you stepping
all over my dick." I give you no
context. That statement's stu-
pidity speaks for itself. There is
literally no situation in the uni-
verse or in the history of any-
thing that would warrant you
saying that.
But, again, for all my picki-
ness, it gets the job done. Genre
fans will enjoy "Riddick." They
will enjoy the performance of
"Battlestar Galactica" 's Katee
Sackhoff as Dahl. She's tough,
sexual (maybe needlessly sexu-
alized) and has a helluva shot.
They will also enjoy Twohy's eye
for campy, effective shots. And
most of all, they will reap the
joys of watching intestines spill,
Rambo-esque tricks and the
purity of its sci-fi horror thrills.
Some will say it's a boring run
around the same course we've
seen before. Others will say it's
passable. I say, "Riddick. It's
been nine years. Welcome back."

evin Gardnerwas on
his back in his own end
zone, looking up at the
lights and a sea 'f maize. It was
the fourth quarter of Michigan
vs. Notre
Dame, and
Gardner
had made
the worst
mistake of
his football
life. Could
his legacy
be tainted ZACH
before it HELFAND
even really
began? The
whole world was here it seemed,
and now they were all looking at
him on his back in the end zone

and he was alone, all alone.
What was he thinking as he
lay there, arms sprawled out-
ward, looking up at the sky, at
the lights? He stared at Stephon
Tuitt, who cradled the football
in his arms in Michigan's end
zone. What was he thinking?
Gardner must have known
that in the fourth quarter, he
had given the Irish the biggest
break of the game. The whole
night had gone as planned until
then, when 12:14 remained in
the game. Michigan led 34-20.
But then Gardner tried too hard
to elude his rushers, and sud-
denly he was in the end zone
and running out of space and
options. Austin Collinsworth hit
him first. Then Prince Shembo.

Gardner got his arm free and
heaved the ball. Tuitt was there
to catch it.
Gardner stayed on his back
and behind him, the Notre
Dame cheerleaders went wild.
He saw the band lose their
mind. He watched Notre Dame
players jump over each other. A
foot beyond Gardner's head, the
Notre Dame leprechaun jumped
up and down, signaling a touch-
down.
The lights were on and the
night had been flawless, but now
the record-setting crowd went
silent. It was falling apart, and
fast. This was Gardner's night-
mare.

Michigan wins last
scheduled home
game of rivalry
By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
The airshow began about a
half hour before kickoff and last-
ed well into Michigan and Notre
Dame's last scheduled meeting
at Michigan Stadium.
It didn't take long for the
high-flying, Devin Gardner-led
Wolverine offense to reclaim the
Ann Arbor air space from the
jets that circled the Big House
during a lengthy pregame fly-

over. Wearing the No. 98 jersey
of Michigan legend Tom Har-
mon, Gardner looked like a leg-
end himself for the majority of
the Wolverines' 41-30 win - as
did his favorite target, fifth-year
senior Jeremy Gallon.
Gallon continued his emer-
gence as the leader of a wide-
receiving corps that had been
one of Michigan's biggest ques-
tion marks entering the season.
He posted career highs of 184,
receiving yards and three touch-
downs.
"He's like a little bulldog,
man," Gardner said of his 5-foot-
8 receiver who plays far beyond
that height. "Behind the doors,
we work so hard. Now we finally
got an opportunity to display it

in front of the biggest crowd in
college football."
That crowd of 115,109 set a.
new NCAA attendance record at
the second night game in Michi-
gan Stadium history.
One year after then-Michigan
quarterback Denard Robin-
son's five-turnover performance
against the Fighting Irish, it
looked as if Gardner might avoid
making any errors. And it wasn't
until the fourth quarter, with
the Wolverines already lead-
ing by two touchdowns, that a
mistake, like the pair of inter-
ceptions Gardner threw in the
opener against Central Michi-
gan, popped up.
Gardner scrambled into his

Five things we learned: Notre Dame

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
This week, we learned Beyon-
ce is a Michigan fan, Eminem is
a weirdo and Athletic Director
Dave Brandon really likes fly-
overs. There was also a pretty
good football game going on.
Here are five other things we
learned this week:
1. This offense is dynamic.
Yes, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke loves his Michigan tra-
ditions, but so far, only the
productive ones. That means
the conservative, punt-happy
approach is gone. Gone too, is the
three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust
offense of Michigan's past. Mich-
igan would love to run the ball up
the middle, but not to the point of
being stubborn.
Take Saturday. Notre Dame
had a behemoth nose tackle clog-
ging the middle. So Michigan
took the fight to the edge. That's
not rocket science, but the game
plan showcased Michigan's ver-
satility. In only the second week
with a new offense, the Wolver-
ines showed they have a deep
playbook.
In the first drive alone, Michi-
gan used a reverse, a double-
reverse and quick pitches to the
outside. Later on, offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges used the pistol
formation, the traditional I-for-
mation and the shotgun. There
were runs up the gut, stretch
plays to the edge, strong play-
action fakes and a sprinkling of
read option.
This was arguably one of the
best games called by Borges in
his time at Michigan. Last year,
Borges was criticized at times for
predictability. Against Nebras-
ka, his play calls displayed an
unmistakable pattern. Against
Ohio State, the Buckeyes knew
what play would be run based on
where Denard Robinson lined up.
Could Borges have been bet-
ter? Probably. But he had few
other options. Now he's got the
full complement of players.

Gardner hit Gallon on a back-
shoulder pass in tight cover-
age. Gallon knew where the
ball would be before he turned
around. On his second touch-
down catch, he used his body to
shield the defender and make a
diving catch.
He'll command extra atten-
tion on the outside, or he'll burn
opponents for it.
3. The defense can use more
playmakers.
First the good: Michigan held
Notre Dame to a respectable 23
points and limited big plays. The
longest gain for Notre Dame on
the game was 23 yards. No back
had a run longer than 16 yards.
That was the game plan. Red-
shirt sophomore cornerback
Blake Countess said the defense
knew Notre :Dame quarterback
Tommy Rees liked to air out the
ball. He could exploit man cover-
age with long fades. So Michigan
played loose.
The plan worked and Michi-
gan won, but this was more
bend-but-don't-break than over-
powering dominance. Notre
Dame hardly ran, but when they
did it was alarmingly effective.
The top two Fighting Irish backs
averaged 5.3 and 7.4 yards a rush.
A cornerback, junior Raymon
Taylor, led the team in tackles.
Thomas Gordon, a safety, was
second.
More concerning was the
lack of big defensive plays. Sure,
Countess had the two game-
changing interceptions, but the
first was a bad pass, and the sec-
ond hit off Taylor's leg. The Wol-
verines need to force the issue
more.
They didn't do that on Satur-
day. They had one sack and only
one hurry. The hurry was pro-
vided by junior defensive end
Frank Clark, who's still search-
ing for his first sack of the season.
He's only two weeks in, but he's
already behind on his prediction
of double-digit sacks.
For all the talk coming out
of camp about how formidable

Clark is as a rusher, he looks not
much off the Clark of 2012.
That's still a pretty good
player to have on the end, but he
admitted he has plenty of room
for improvement. The defense
does too.
4. The rotation behind Tous-
saint doesn't really matter.
Fitzgerald Toussaint was the
undisputed No. 1 running back
entering the season, but he had a
stable of five eager backs behind
him who looked like they could
steal some carries.
Freshman Derrick Green, the
highly-touted recruit, especially
looked like he could challenge
Toussaint for the starting job.
But Toussaint was the workhorse
Saturday.
He rushed 22 times for 83
yards. Green was the only other
running back with a carry. He
lost a yard.
Toussaint didn't have a career
performance, but he showed
patience and vision. He turned
losses into gains. And more
importantly, he has the trust of
his coaches. 4
5. Bold prediction: Michigan
will be 9-0 heading into North-
western.
OK, this has as much to do
with what we learned about
Michigan State and Nebraska
as it does Michigan. But Notre
Dame is likely the toughest team
Michigan will face until Ohio
State, and the Wolverines were
clearly the better team:
Meanwhile, Michigan State's
offense is offensive. Even on the
road, Michigan could be favored.
Nebraska could give the Wolver-
ines trouble, but the game is at
home, where Hoke is undefeated.
A game at Penn State will be dif-
ficult, but Michigan is more tal-
ented.
Don't be surprised if Michigan
is favored from here until at least
Nov. 16. And don't be surprised if
they're undefeated heading into
that game, too.

Tg TAMOL d s sFF/aily
fifth'year senior running back Fitzgerald Teussaint had 22 carries fsr 71 yards. He has established himself as the workhorse.

Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner could be a tra-
ditional drop-back passer. He
finished with 294 yards and
four touchdowns. Route com-
binations can be more complex
with him as the passer. But his
legs add a new wrinkle, one that
allows the read-option to remain.
It is especially potent in the red
zone and on third downs.
The playbook is wide open.
And Michigan's offense has sel-
dom looked this dynamic.
2. Gallon is even better than we
thought.

Can we put to rest the argu-
ment that Michigan doesn't have
any weapons on the outside?
Fifth-year senior wide receiver
Jeremy Gallon is one. That much
is glaringly obvious. Gallon had
eight catches Saturday for 184
yards and three touchdowns.
It was one of Michigan's best
receiving performances in recent
memory.
Since Gardner took over at
quarterback, Gallon has been
Michigan's receptions leader in
every single game. Taking Gal-
lon's seven-game totals with

Gardner as the passer, he'd be on
pace for 80 receptions, 13 touch-
downs and nearly 1,400 yards
over a full 13-game season.
That's notjust a weapon on the
outside. That would make him
the best wide receiver in the Big
Ten.
Gallon, who is listed at 5-foot-
8, has long been overlooked
because of his size. Notre Dame
inexplicably left him open across
the middle of the field again, and
he torched them for a 61-yard
touchdown.
But he is just as dangerous in
traffic. In the second quarter,

Following the win, the Wol-
verines - with graduated middle
blocker Claire McElheny at their
side - headed over to the Big
House, where they were hon-
ored once more by the Michigan
football team for their Final Four
appearance.
"I don't think we necessarily
want to focus on the past, but we
certainly want to honor the past,"
said Michigan coach Mark Rosen.
"The banner was sort of one last
honor of last year, and now we'll
focus on this year."
The Wolverines began the
opening weekend with another
dominant, four-set victory over
Oregon State.
Michigan hit .460 in the first
two sets against the Beavers en
route to a 2-0 advantage heading
into the third set.
In the first set, Erwin added
six of her 13 kills, including a final
swing to put the Wolverines up
23-16 before two Oregon State
errors put Michigan up 1-0. A 5-0
service rally from Cross - who
finished the game with 11 kills and
two blocks - was followed by six
straight serves from Toon which
gave the Wolverines an easy 25-14
win in the second set.
But after 12 ties and seven lead
changes in the third set, Michi-
gan dropped its first and only set
of the season after 11 consecutive
victories. Cole put the Wolver-
ines up 12-9 early, but the Beavers
answered with an 8-2 run. Tied at
19, Cole contributed yet another
kill, while Erwin gave Michigan.

high. The freshman also contrib-

"(Cole) is a great learner, she's
very humble and she just keeps
progressing," Rosen said. "The
best thing about Abby is that she's
nowhere close to as good as she's
going to be. As a coach, nothing is
more exciting than that."
Added Cole: "I'm excited. ... I
just think the transitioning has

Daily Sports Editor
Under the Lights II was
familiar in many senses, with
typical Michigan-Notre Dame
hold-your-breath plays and a
record-breaking crowd.
But there was still something
incredibly off about the whole
thing - seeing a player in a No.
98 jersey taking snaps at quarter-
back.
But that's the new normal
for Michigan. Redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner is
No. 12 no more
as he was the NOTEBOOK
sixth and final
Wolverine to be honored with
a Michigan Legends jersey by
receiving Tom Harmon's 'Ole 98.'
But don't worry, even Har-
mon's son - actor Mark Harmon
- is still a little confused by see-
ing his dad's number on the field
again.
"The only time that I've seen
No. 98 on the field in a Michigan
jersey was on film," Mark said.
"He was a father, and he was a
family guy. He cared about his
kids and his family.
"It's important for a young kid
somewhere who looks at that and
says, 'Wow, someday I'd like to
strap into one of those winged
helmets and see if I can't do the
same thing."'
Harmon was honored in a pre-
game ceremony, with Mark as the
Harmon family representative.
The relationship between the
Michigan Athletic Department
and the Harmons began a few
years ago when Michigan's then-
club lacrosse team took a trip to
California. Coach John Paul was
familiar with Mark, and Athletic
Director Dave Brandon reached
out to Mark through Paul, as
a way to build a relationship
between Michigan and one of its
most legendary players.
"I think it's hugely important
that we celebrate these legacies,
these traditions and these heroic
figures," Brandon said. "So, let's
take it out of the dusty cabinet,
let's put it on the field, and let's
put his name on it and celebrate
it every time Michigan comes out

own end zone early in the
fourth quarter and attempted
to get rid of the ball to avoid
being brought down for a safe-
ty. Notre Dame's Stephon Tuitt
made one of the most athletic
plays possible for a 322-pound
defensive lineman, diving to
come up with the interception
and bring the Fighting Irish
(1-1) to within a touchdown.
"It was a horrible decision,"
Gardner said.
Overall, Gardner looked
even more versatile than in
Week 1. And it was how he
responded to his one miscue
that showed the kind of quar-
terback he has become.
After a Michigan (2-0)
punt on the ensuing posses-
sion, Notre Dame quarterback
Tommy Rees led the Fighting
Irish down the field, though
they settled for a 40-yard field
goal to cut the deficit to 34-30.
It could've unraveled there.
This was Michigan-Notre
Dame, and no amount of late-
game dramatics could be too
much for this chapter.
But the defense held the
Fighting Irish to a field goal
on the next drive. Then Gard-
ner, rather than succumbing
to what he called "adversity,"
found fifth-year running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint for a
31-yard completion.
Two crucial pass interfer-
ence penalties against Notre
Dame and a four-yard touch-
down pass to senior wide
receiver Drew Dileo stopped
the rally in its tracks. Redshirt
sophomore Blake Countess'
second career interception
- both of which came on Sat-
urday night - sealed the Wol-
verines' fourth straight win
over the Fighting Irish in Ann
Arbor. Michigan coach Brady
Hoke improved to 16-0 at
Michigan Stadium.
Despite Gardner's massive
mistake that gave Notre Dame
a second life, he finished 21 for
33, racking up 294 yards and
four touchdowns in addition
to one on the ground. He also
rushed for 82 yards.
Gardner completed his first
four passes of the game to four
different receivers - none
of them Gallon. The opening
possession ended in a field goal
from fifth-year senior kicker
Brendan Gibbons, who broke
the program record with his
15th consecutive made kick.
On the next Michigan drive,
Gardner and Gallon began to
steal the night. With plenty of
time to throw despite facing
an experienced Notre Dame
front seven, Gardner found
another Michigan jersey hon-
oree, Gallon, wide open for a
60-yard touchdown pass. Gal-
lon, wearing Desmond How-
ard's No. 21, spun off of two
would-be tacklers on his first
of three trips to the end zone
Saturday.
Notre Dame began to show
signs of life on its next drive.
Rees capped it off with a for-
tunate four-yard touchdown
pass that deflected off run-
ning back George Atkinson
III's hands into those of wide
receiver TJ Jones. On their
next drive, the Fighting Irish
tied the game at 10 with a
44-yard field goal of their own.
But Gardner and Gallon

regained control quickly.
Gardner capped a 12-play,
75-yard drive with a two-
yard option touchdown dash,
allowing Michiganto enter the
locker room with a 27-13 lead,
which looked likely to slip
away before Gardner and the
defense righted the ship.
In doing so, Gardner and
Gallon proved they're worthy
of the legends' numbers they
bore.

TEN HANDS
From Page 1B
there for 13 seconds.
Michael Schofield was the first
to get to him. He tugged Gardner
by the jersey and tried to pull
him up. Gardner threw his hands
over his facemask and shielded
his eyes, as if just realizing now
what he had done.
He stayed on the ground.
Miller was soon there too.
Kyle Kalis followed Miller, and
then came Graham Glasgow and
Taylor Lewan. The whole line
was there: 1,514 pounds of human
to lift up one man. They pulled
Gardner to his feet.
Gardner reached the sideline
and ripped off his chinstrap. His
face scrunched in pain. Frank
Clark approached him.
"Told him we had his back,"
Clark would say later. "We call
each other not a team, but we call
each other a tribe. We're all in it
together. We're all one."
Lewan was there, too.
"I went up to him," Lewan
said. "I letchim know thatyou're
our quarterback for a reason.
You're the Michigan quarterback.
You're the reason why we're in
this game."

But the nightmare continued.
After the interception, Gardner
threw his next pass to Jeremy
Gallon and then had to watch as
Gallon, Gardner's "little bulldog,"
stayed down on the field, injured.
Gardner watched a player false
start, and then he sawtight end
Devin Funchess was hurt too,
and Lewan was walking off the
field holding his eye. Michigan
went three and out, and the punt
went 21 yards and now the Irish
had the ball down by just one
touchdown.
James Ross III could've swung
the momentum with an intercep-
tion, but it fell through his hands.
A field goal cut the lead to just
four, and here we go again in this
series thatchas no business end-
ing after nextyear's game.
In this rivalry, games like this
have become more than a game.
They become a celebration, of a
team, of a town, of a school. Your
dad is in town, and so is your
buddy who graduated and you
don't see much anymore. You go
to Zingerman's and order No. 34,
just like old times, and you walk
through the Diag and drink too
much at Rick's until you stumble
back home on a friend's shoulder.
This stadium is the biggest in
the sport, and it's still a wonder it

can hold everyone who has come
back to this place.
Mark Harmon came back
for his father. Trey Burke, Tim
Hardaway Jr. and Cazzie Rus-
sell were there. Michael Phelps,
too. Anthony Carter and Steve
Hutchinson and Steve Everett
and Desmond Howard. You were
there too, and maybe you were
sitting next to your West Quad
roommate. Eminem was even
there. Sort of, anyway.
The game was choreographed
from the opening flyover to
the Tom Harmon ceremony to
Beyonce on the video boards
saying "Go Blue." The game had
gone as planned for Gardner too.
But the universe tends toward
entropy. Things fell apart, and he
was faced with panic and disor-
der. How would he respond?
Five of his buddies did it for
him. Gardner was frozen on the
ground and his line picked him
up. The defense reminded him
they'd have his back.
Gardner redeemed himself,
on a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown
drive that sealed the game for
Michigan. And yes, this was
Gardner's night. The legacy jer-
sey, the 294 yards passing and
four touchdowns and another 82
yards and a score on the ground.

But he didn't doit alone. He
had Fitzgerald Toussaint, who
stopped the momentum with a
broken tackle and a 22-yard run.
He had the sure hands of Drew
Dileo in the end zone. He had
Blake Countess and his two inter-
ceptions. He had his linemen.
Saturday night, under the
lights, this team figured it out.
That Gardner-to-Gallon could
slice up one of the nation's best
defenses and make it look easy.
That it could repair its leader's
mistakes. That this team was a
tribe.
"We're starting to get it,"
Lewan said afterthe game. "This
team understands what we need
to do to become a championship
team."
You gather with 115,109 other
people, and it seems like the
whole world is there. It's hard
to feel alone. And then you're on
the ground, and the stadium has
gone quiet, and everyone is look-
ing at you and it's your fault and
yours alone.
It's sure as hell nice to have
help pulling yourself backup
again.
