Hu discusses new
ways to promote
studies at Thursday
regents meeting
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
After a fiscal year marked
by record-breaking University
research expenditures and cuts
in federal research funding, S.
Jack Hu, interim vice president
for research, called for continu-
ing innovation in the ways in
which the University funds its
research at the meeting of the
University's Board of Regents
Thursday.
Though statistics for the Uni-
versity's 2013 fiscal year budget
were released in September, Hu
made his first in-depth regents
meeting presentation Thurs-
day, in which he emphasized the
importance of collaborating with
foundations and industries to
offset the impact of federal fund-
ing declines.
Amid an uncertain climate
for federal research funding, the
University reported a 4.3-per-
cent increase in research expen-
ditures, reaching $1.3 billion in

the 2013 fiscal year.
"We achieved this milestone
in the climate of declining fed-
eral support," Hu said. "But the
increase in our research expen-
diture is a true measure of the
excellence of our faculty."
Hu said faculty members
have continued to apply aggres-
sively to grants despite projected
declines from top funders such as
the National Institutes of Health.
According to the University's
report, NIH funding - which
accounted for 40.8 percent of fed-
eral funding last year - declined
by 1.8 percent in the previous fis-
cal year. The federal government
sponsored 61.5 percent of Uni-
versity research last year.
After Hu's report, University
President Mary Sue Coleman,
who has a background in bio-
chemistry, asked him whether
federal agencies maintained
the number of grant awards by
decreasing the amount of fund-
ing provided for each grant as a
result of the federal sequestra-
tion.
Hu told Coleman this narra-
tive is quite common. Agencies
often offer researchers grants on
the condition that the researcher
reduce their budget by a certain
percentage.

Wolverines shake
sluggish start, pull
away late in tourney
opener
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
MILWAUKEE - In its return
to the NCAA Tournament, the
Michigan men's basketball didn't

face quite the excitement of its
last time inthe postseason.
Which, in March, is a bit of
surprise.
The second-seeded Wolver-
ines grabbed a 14-point halftime
lead and ultimately a 57-40 win
- its lowest-scoring game of the
season - in the second round
of the NCAA Tournament over
No. 15-seed Wofford to advance
Round of 32 in the Midwest
Regional.
Playing in a Bradley Center

that was half-filled at tipoff, both
the Terriers and No. 7 Michi-
gan began their postseasons
sluggishly. But regardless of the
lethargic pace in the first stanza
and beginning of the second, the
Wolverines' inside presence was
too much to overcome.
After falling to an 18-point
deficit with nearly three minutes
of scoreless play to begin the sec-
ond half, Wofford (11-5 Southern,
20-13 overall) began its comeback
attempt, going on an 8-0 run.

Though the run wasn't flashy or
quick in time, the lead was cut
to 10 in a game in which Michi-
gan never could seem to truly get
going.
That run was finally snapped
following a multiple-shot pos-
session by the Wolverines (15-3
Big Ten, 26-8) that ended with a
dunk by redshirt junior forward
Jon Horford. But Michigan's cold
shooting from the field persisted
after they shot 64 percent in the

CRIME
Lewan facing
charges related
to Dec. assault

Offensive lineman
will be arraigned
in April on three
separate counts
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Taylor Lewan, the former
left tackle for the Michi-
gan football team, will be
arraigned next month and
charged with three misde-
meanors according to court
records obtained by The Mich-
igan Daily.
The Ann Arbor News first
reported the charges.
Lewan will be charged with
two counts of assault and bat-
tery and one count of aggra-
vated assault when he appears
in court on April 8.
The charges refer to a Dec.
1 incident in which two Ohio
State football fans reported
being assaulted by Lewan out-
side The Brown Jug Restau-
rant after the Michigan-Ohio
State football game to day
before.
Lewan denied any involve-
ment in the altercation in
December, saying he was sim-
ply trying to stop the fight.
"I wasn't in any fight," he
told reporters before Michi-

gan's appearance in the Buf-
falo Wild Wings Bowl. "I
didn't hit anybody. I was really
just trying to help out a situa-
tion and break up something.
I can't really go into any more
details than that."
Should he be found guilty
of assault and battery, Lewan
could face up to 93 days in jail
or a $500 fine.
During his Michigan foot-
ball career, Lewan was a
two-time All American. He is
expected to be an early pick
in the NFL Draft this spring,
being pegged as one of the top-
three offensive linemen.
NOTE: Redshirt junior left
guard Graham Glasgow has
been suspended from spring
practice and the Wolverines'
2014 home opener against
Appalachian State on August
30 for a violation of team
expectations, according to a
press release on Thursday.
"Each of our young men
understands the standard we
expect of them," Hoke said
in a statement. "It's one that
represents this great program
and university, as well as their
family and teammates. When
their actions don't reflect that
standard, it's very disappoint-
ing, and we must hold them
accountable for their decision
while helping them learn a
valuable life lesson."

CSG President Michael Proppe delivered his monthly report to the regents Thursday afternoon. Proppe, whose term
concludes at the end of the academic year, called on the regents to engage students in policy decisions.

With less than a week before the

Outgoing leader
promotes student
influence in
address to regents
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Gov-
ernment has had a busy few
months. They helped shape a
new football seating policy for
students, supported a push for
increasing diversity and inclu-
sivity led by the Black Student
Union, as well as pushed new
campus safety initiatives.

In his report to the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents at
their monthly meeting Thurs-
day, Business senior Michael
Proppe, CSG president, said
each of these initiatives proves
the power of students in offer-
ing and implementing alter-
natives to solutions initially
proposed by administrators.
"I remind everyone of the
lesson we learned from Ath-
letics: administrators might
not have all the answers," he
said. "Athletics thought gen-
eral admission would change
student behavior and get more
students to the games on time.
They thought the negative
reaction would peter out over

time. They were wrong on both
counts. This time, they engaged
students and the outcome could
not be more positive. It is impor-
tant to engage students every
step of the way before making
any change that will affect the
student experience."
Proppe urged the regents and
administrators to implement
the lesson learned with future
endeavors.
"If administrators and stu-
dents can work together to solve
football seating, imagine what
we can do on something impor-
tant," he said.
The jab drew a few laughs
around the table of the Uni-

their platforms have considerable
overlap. Both focus on increasing
disersity at the University. mak-
ing the campus safer and reform-
ing athletics policies --namely
seating and ticketing at events -

While they may agree about
the issues that need attention,

gested methods of implementing
change.
Public Policy junior Carly
5013

Manes, FORUM's presidential
candidate and a current LSA rep-
resentative on the CSG Assembly,
said diversity is the most impor-
tant of FORUM's four platform
points.
"That expands to not only
racial diversity, but diversity of
thought, diversity of experience.
diversity of interaction with the
University and how different stu-
dents experience Michigan," she
said. "It's important to allow for
space for all the experiences and
improve upon all of those experi-
ences."
LSA junior Pavitra Abraham,
FORUM's vice presidential can-
didate who is also a current
LSA representative on the CSG
Assembly, said accounting for the
breadth of individual experienc-
es will also be contingent upon
increasing students' access to the
services CSG has to offer.
"We really want to advocate
to empower all of those commu-
nities on campus and also make
5-m

sure that all of those communi-
ties are represented at the CSG
table," Abraham said.
To bring a larger range of
diverse voices to the University,
FoRUM plans to advocate for
financial aid for undocumented
students, drive increased recruit-
ing and on-site admission in
underrepresented communities
and reform the Race and Ethnic-
ity distribution requirement.
Of these objectives, Manes has
already begun her work on the
1R&E requirement. She has met
with University administrators
since October to draft a proposal
for a new, more encompassing
"identity" requirement, which
she and a coalition of students
presented to the LSA Curriculum
Committee Tuesdaynight for ini-
tial comments and suggestions.
Public Policy junior Bobby
Dishell, the Make Michigan pres-
idential candidate and current
CSG vice president, said diver-
sity relates to another often over-
looked issue on campus: mental
health. This belief jointly reflects
two of Make Michigan's five plat-
form pillars: health and diversity.
"Mental health is a huge issue
here on campus and it kind of hits
on all of our points," Dishell said.
"Mental health is something that
affects all students, and when you
are able to be mentally healthy, it
also is going to help the racial cli-
mate on campus and make people
feel safer in general."
Dishell and LSA sophomore
Meagan Shokar, the Make Michi-
gan vice presidential candidate
and currentspeaker of the assem-
bly, plan to implement a Universi-
ty-wide peer support program.
The new program would have

From Page 1
"They are trying to keep the
number of grants up but reduce
the amount of each grant," he said.
However, Hu said decreases in
total funding from the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Ser-
vices were mitigated by increases
in funding from the National Sci-
ence Foundation and the Depart-
ments of Energy and Defense. The
Department of Transportation
injected a 60.2-percent bump in
University research funding.
Recently, transportation-relat-
ed research projects have been a
large focus of expansion for the
University's research portfolio.

firsthalf.
It wasn't until after Wofford
made its first 3-pointer after 14
misses with 9:25 left that cut the
Wolverines' lead to single digits
that some excitement finally came
out of Michigan.
Using his eminently present
height advantage, fifth-year senior
Jordan Morgan completed an and-1
play, staring at the Terrier defender
who landed on the ground in the
process.
Starting with that basket, Mich-
igan ended the game on a 17-7 run,
making up for its 2-for-14 shooting
in the half up to that point.
Though the poor shooting in
the second half inhibited Michi-
igan's desire to put the game out
of reach earlier, its defense made
sure the game never was within
reach of being given away.
"Most times, we don't have
very much trouble scoring the
basketball from different people,"
said Morgan, who finished with
10 points and 10 rebounds. "So,
we know we're only going to go
as far as our defense carries us,

simulated urban environments
and roads to research new trans-
portation-related innovations.
Last month, President Barack
Obama announced a new estab-
lishment of the American Light-
weight Materials Manufacturing
Innovation Institute, part of a net-
work of innovation centers run by
collaborations of companies, non-
profits and higher education insti-
tutions, includingthe University.
Hu said partnerships with
industries and foundations are key
components of safeguarding and
expanding the University's mas-
sive research enterprise.
Despite a precarious stream of
federal funding, the report noted
non-federal funding was up 18.4
percent over the previous fiscal
year. Hu said industry-sponsored
research rose by 14.2 percent. He
also noted these partnerships
"will enrich the experience of our
and we never know what game is
going tobe our last.
"So we just want to play every
game defensively as best as we
can."
Added sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III: "Our
defense struck the win for us,
and I think alot of people would
doubt our defense coming into
this game."
Michigan shot 48 percent
from the field, and something
seemed off given Michigan's typ-
ically hot shooting ways.
After falling behind 4-0 to
start the game, the Wolverines
went on a 9-0 run to take the lead,
one they would never relinquish
to the upset-seeking Terriers. But
that start proved critical as Mich-
igan never found the speed it usu-
ally relies on so heavily.
Though the Wolverines
attempted to push the tempo when
they gained possession of the ball,
it was hard for them to set the
tempo against a team used to using
every second of the shot clock on its
possessions. That, coupled with the
Terriers limiting them to one shot
on most possessions, enabled Wof-
ford to stick around.
Wofford never really got with-

students and better prepare them
for future careers in academic,
industry and have become an
important mechanism to attract
federal funding."
Hu also listed several key strat-
egies for growing the University's
research expenditures in a chal-
lenging climate, such as expand-
ing clinical trials, seeking more
funds from foundations and phil-
anthropic gifts, streamlining sub-
mission proposals and forming
international partnerships.
Still, he was unwilling to write
off the role of local, state and fed-
eral government agencies in sup-
porting the University's research
mission.
"We must work with policy-
makers to make sure the support
from the federal government for
research will continue over time,"
Hu said.
in striking distance of Michigan,
because the Wolverines limited
the Terriers from behind the arc
and for the most part from the
field, too, as evidenced by their
34-percent shooting.
Michigan was not only able to
get shots close to the hoop but run
the ball in transition in the first
half to open up its double-digit
lead. The Terriers finished 1-for-
19 from behind the arc.
"Before we played them, we
emphasized how great they are
from behind the arc," said fresh-
man guard Derrick Walton Jr.
"Our main thing was to run them
off the line, and if you can't, con-
test them really hard."
Though the shooting night
for Wolverines wasn't up to par,
Robinson still managed 14 points
thanks to a 7-0 individual run in
the final minutes of the first half.
Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas
led the team with 15.
The win wasn't the smoothest
by any standards for Michigan,
but now that it's March, it doesn't
really matter.
"Whatever win you can get is
a good win," Walton said. "We're
happy we got this win even though
it wasn't really pretty."

future meeting.
In the wake of the contentious
vote, some CSG representatives
who voted for postponement have
claimed to have received threats as
a resultof their decision.
In previous elections, issues such
as entrepreneurship and tuition
equality were the defining issues.
But the #UMDivest movement has
inserted itself into campaign season
in force, creating an unexpected
variable in the race.
LSA senior Yazan Kherallah, the
divestment chair of SAFE, prom-
ised that the #UMDivest movement
would take to the polls next week in
response to Tuesday's meeting.
"We're going to hold every per-
son who voted against listening to
student voices accountable," Kher-
allah said Tuesday night. "These
investments impact the friends and
family ofstudents."
However, the two largest parties
fielding candidates in the upcom-
ing election, Make Michigan and
FORUM - both of which have
numerous incumbents in CSG -
have not taken a stance on the reso-
lution or the issue of divestment.
Public Policy senior Greg Terryn,
a CSG representative and spokesman
forFORUM,saidFORUMdidnottell
its members on the assembly how to
voteonthedivestmentresolution.
"We're glad to see students
voicing their concerns," Terryn
said, adding that FORUM asked
its members to "vote your con-
science, vote your heart."
LSA senior Andrew Craft,
chair of Make Michigan, wrote in
a statement that Make Michigan
wants to remain open in dialogue.
"We are not ignoring the point,"
he wrote. "We agree that every stu-
dent's voice must be heard on cam-
pus, and every member of Make
Michigan is ready and willing to
discuss the issue with any student."
FORUM's presidential and vice
presidential candidates, Public
Policy junior Carly Manes and LSA
junior Pavitra Abraham, are both
current representatives and voted
against indefinite postponement
of the resolution. Make Michigan's
candidates, Public Policy junior
Bobby Dishell, the party's presi-

dential nominee and current CSG
vice president, and LSA sophomore
Meagan Shokar, the vice presiden-
tial nominee and current assembly
speaker, were noteligible to vote on
postponement.
Terryn did, however, add that
the high student turnout at Tues-
day's meeting - the highest in
recentmemory-was positive.
"Regardless of where you stand
on this issue, it's great to see such
student mobilization," he said.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, CSG president, said
threatening and inflammatory
messages have been directed at
CSG representatives, particu-
larly those who voted to table
the resolution Tuesday, through
social media and other online
outlets as well as in person.
Proppe said some of the mes-
sages being sent were "angry
rhetoric," but added there were
also more serious threats, to the
point that some representatives
are afraid to attend their classes
because they feel unsafe.
LSA senior Bayan Founas, a
member of SAFE, said SAFE in no
way condones such threats and
none of its members are participat-
ing or being encouraged to do so.
While Dishell said many of those
sending threats identified them-
selves in association with SAFE,
both he and Proppe said they do
not believe these aggressors are
part of SAFE, and communication
between the two groups has gone
smoothly so far.
Founas added that members
of SAFE and students on campus
who are perceived to be Arab have
faced threats as well, similar in
nature to the ones received by CSG
representatives. She said one SAFE
member was allegedly physically
assaulted earlier this week, though
University Police were unable to
confirm whether or not the incident
occurred.
Proppe reported the situation at
Tuesday's meeting to the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents on Thursday.
"The student government has
an obligation to hear our con-
stituents out," he said.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Proppe said while he does not
support this or any divestment
movements, he thought the assem-
bly should have voted either for or

against the proposal. He added that
this is the first time in his presiden-
cy that the assembly has postponed
avote indefinitely.
He added that it is important for
all students to be given an opportu-
nity for their voices tobe heard, but
supporting the movement outright
is more complicated.
"There is specific action that's
been put in there and there are
other communities who do feel
targeted by the resolution," he said.
"There's so much stuff that we in
the student government can do
when the student body agrees on
things but that's really our oppor-
tunity to be effective here, this was
such a divisive topic that I hesitate
to waive the vote."
Founas said the group will remain
in the CSG chambers until it meets
five demands: to repeal Tuesday's
decision, keep CSG meetings com-
pletely open to the public with no
closed sessions, allow unlimited
public commentary, require CSG
representatives to attend a "teach-in"
session to better learn about the issue
athand andmake apublicapology.
Proppeexplainedhisplanstothe
group Wednesday night. He said
he will motion to reconsider the
vote on the proposal at next week's
meeting and will send it to a second
readingif itfails.
He added that he will propose
to add an extra half-hour to both
public commentary sessions of
the meeting, but such action will
require approvalifrom the assembly.
Additionally, he will allow a presen-
tation about the Israeli occupation
before the meeting for the repre-
sentatives to watch in place of the
teach-in session, which represen-
tatives cannot be forced to attend.
Proppe added that he will allow
presentations from other student
groups such as Hillel if they request
it.
He said these accommodations
are only being made because of the
rare decision to tablethe vote, but a
failure to vote on a resolution can-
not be overturned by a sit-in.
Members of SAFE and their sup-
porters left the chambers last night
when the building closed at 2 a.m.
Founas said this was only because
Proppe came to meet with the
group. She added that people chose
on their own to stay the night on
Thursday.

versity's executive officers and
regents.
In response to the CSG presi-
dent report, Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann
Arbor) acknowledged there are
times when regents or Univer-
sity officials do not have all the
answers.
"I do think you're right," she
said. "I do think there are times

deeper understanding of each
other," Dishell said. "It's about
getting a mutual respect of each
other and becoming vulnerable
with one another. When you let
your guard down, you really can
get to know people."
In addition to a more tight-knit
campus climate, Dishell and Sho-
kar also plan to increase diversity
by working with the Alumni Asso-
ciation's LEAD Scholars program,
which provides merit scholarships
to underrepresented students at
the University.
Dishell said he hopes to take
these efforts one step further - by
increasing on-site recruitment and
admissions. While he acknowl-
edged that this goal was exactly
the same as FORUM's aspirations,
he said Make Michigan has the
upper hand because of its connec-
tion to the Alumni Association.
"They don't have those met-
rics," he said. "The biggest differ-
ence between us and them lies in
the party name. We have an action

tors can get more done working
together than just administra-
tors making decisions."
The Board of Regents received
criticism earlier in the year for
failing to include any students
in the presidential search com-
mittee that ultimately selected
University President-elect Mark
Schlissel to serve as the Univer-
sity's 14th leader.
The search committee ulti-
mately gathered input from a
student advisory search com-
mittee formed by CSG.
In response to recent criti-
cism by the Black Student Union
plan. Everything we have on there
has what we're doing and how
we're going to do it. We're going
to Make Michigan, and we really
show that in all of our points.
Whereas they are 'FORUM,' they
want to have a forum on it, but
they don't have that action plan in
place."
Shokar added that the experi-
ence she and Dishell have gained
in CSG executive positions over
the last year adds to their abil-
ity to execute - their connection
and experience with administra-
tors signify a level of knowledge
of University bureaucracy that
FORUM lacks.
"Bobby and I have so much
experience in CSG," she said.
"We've had a lot of time to work
in these roles and to really under-
stand how to make CSG most effi-
cient. And both of those things are
incredibly important when you
only have one term in office."
While she acknowledges room
for improvement, Shokar said she
sees her and Dishell's candidacy
as a continuation of work and rela-
tionship development with Uni-
versity administrators.

- which has claimed the Uni-
versity's administration has
failed to act on student demands
to improve the campus climate
for minority communities -
University officials began a
series of meetings with organiz-
ers to address these issues.
In his report, Proppe outlined
numerous safety initiatives stu-
dents have successfully imple-
mented - such as the CSG and
Interfraternity Council's col-
laborations on the off-campus
Night Owl bus, a new Safe Ride
app and the ban on hard liquor
at open fraternity parties.
Abraham said this type of expe-
rience as CSG executives, while
valuable, does not make either
Dishell or Shokar more qualified
to lead, citing a lack of CSG pro-
ductivity this year as a cause for
new management.
Speaking specifically about
diversity, she said she was offend-
ed by the fact that diversity has
only recently become a "buzz-
word" or a cool thing to be inter-
ested in, when its absence has
been an important University
issue for years.
Citing work that she and Manes
have done since their freshman
year to increase diversity on cam-
pus, among other issues, Abraham
said connections aren't exclusive
to CSG executives.
"It's one thing to tout these
administrative ties, but at the
same time, to act like you're the
only one that has them is faulty,"
she said. "Both Carly and I have
been working with this University
and with deans of varying schools
and with administrators and other
campus years since we were fresh-
men. They're not the only ones to
have those skills."


WINE
From Page 1
Wednesday they will allow cus-
tomers to bring in their own
wine for the time being, provided
that it is wine that the restaurant
doesn't already serve.
Additionally, all wine brought
in will be subject to a corkage fee.
Roger Hewitt, owner of Red
Hawk Bar & Grill downtown,
said the restaurant hasn't made a
decision yet but will likely follow
a similar path.
"If it allows our customers a

greater selection than we're able
to offer, I think that's great,"
Hewitt said.
He added that the only factor
holding the restaurant back from
opting into the law was the added
responsibility that comes with it.
"It's one additional thing you
have to monitor to make sure
you're in compliance with the
law, and your customers are
in compliance with the law, so
there's potential exposure, and
you know, bureaucracy," Hewitt
said.
Right now, the restaurant is
planning to charge about $15 for

the corkage fee, he said.
LSA senior Louise Colo said
she thinks that wine is popular
for students in certain settings,
but not necessarily in those that
the law addresses, so it's unlikely
students' habits will be changed.
"I think it's more something
that you'd drink at home," Colo
said. "It depends on where you're
going out to. Like going out to a
restaurant to eat, if you're 21 or
over, a lot of people like to order
it with meals. But as far as just
drinking wine goes, and buying a
bottle, I'd say it's more of an at-
home thing."

Let's talk about race
University departments should open discussion on race
The English Department held an open-mic event on March
18 that gave students an opportunity to discuss experiences
and issues they have had in the classroom regarding race.
We commend the English Department for acknowledging the effect
campus racial climate on classroom learning experience, and for
taking steps to effect change and improve race relations in the
department. Other University departments should follow its example.

A safer stadium

As easy as it is to hate on Ath-
letic Director Dave Brandon,
the man deserves praise
when he makes
the rare correct
decision - even
when it's com-
pletely obvious to
the rest of us.
On Mon- .
day, Brandon
announced that
the University ALEXANDER
would continue HERMANN
abstaining from
serving alcohol at
Michigan Stadium
during home football games, both
for safety reasons and the logistical
nightmare that would ensue.
Though Brandon and the
University likely never intended to
sell alcohol at Michigan sporting
events - especially to non-suite
and club-level patrons - the
issue came to a head when the
NHL's Winter Classic on Jan.
1 received permission from the
University's Board of Regents,
and through a special motion in
the state legislature, to serve beer
in Michigan Stadium. College
stadiums across . the country
sell alcohol to fans in "premium
seating," but few provide the same
forgeneral admissionticketholders.
At the same time, however, both
numbers are growing.
Anyone that's attended an NFL

game sober in the last decade can
tell you Brandon's decision is the
right move.
Long before NFL teams faced
declining ticket sales resulting
from the proliferation of high-def
television, fantasy football and all the
headaches associated with attending
games - not to mention the rising
cost of everything from tickets, to
concessions, to parking - drunken
assholes have kept fans interested in,
you know, just watching football at
bay for years. Now, the NFL's doing
everything it can to "enhance" the
in-stadium experience, including
planning to offer free Wi-Fi at all
32 NFL arenas.
Everyone has their own personal
anecdotes displaying repulsive NFL
fan behavior. Individually they
prove nothing, so I'll refrain from
sharing mine. You're welcome,
Cleveland Browns fan that dumped
a beer on me, an opposing 16-year-
old Lions fan in the Cleveland
Browns Stadium, demonstrating
the most appropriate use of a $7
Miller Lite.
Of course, Brandon's choice
will hardly prevent fans from
continuing the long-standing
tradition of getting hammered
before games or sneaking alcohol
in, but selling alcohol would almost
certainly increase the number of
negative "incidents" within the
stadium. Contrarians like to cite the
reported decrease in police arrests,

calls and charges following West
Virginia University's allowance of
beer sales during the 2011 football
season. But, I question the role of
simultaneous increases in security
at football games, or the newly
enacted policy preventing fans
from leaving the stadium to drink
in the parking lot before reentering
the stadium - a practice that's been
disallowed at Michigan for years.
Not to mention profits have
been smaller than you might think
at some other Big Ten schools.
Minnesota actually reported a loss
of $16,000 from alcohol sales for the
2012-2013 season.
Combine Brandon's declaration
Tuesday with last week's
announcement regarding the
new student ticket policy at home
football games - effectively a
mea culpa for the failed general
admission experiment - and
Brandon is on a roll.
Though both decisions are fairly
obvious steps forward to the rest
of us, given Brandon's penchant
for imbibing in unnecessary,
profit-motivated behavior at the
expense of fan and student welfare,
even small victories are worth
celebrating. Maybe with a few
more common sense judgments
we can declare that Brandon's
on his own pathway to reform.

Departmental action is a proper response
to student calls for racial equality on campus.
The #BBUM campaign in early
November and the United Coalition for
Racial Justice's "Speak Out" event in the
Shapiro Undergraduate Library in February
demonstrated a need to address these issues.
Facilitating open discussion in the classroom
is the first step.
However, there are several other actions
the University should take in order to create
safer learning spaces. One of the main issues
highlighted by the students at the open-mic
event was poor facilitation of classroom
dialogue by graduate student instructors
and professors. All GSIs and professors
of social science and humanities courses
should undergo training comparable to
that of intergroup dialogue facilitators to
ensure heightened sensitivity to diverse
perspectives. Instructors should also make
a concerted effort to give students "trigger
warnings" that alert them to upcoming class
materials that could be potentially offensive,
explicitor controversial.
Further, students should have the

opportunity to anonymously evaluate courses
and instructor performance at any time so
that issues can come to light while there is
still time to change instruction techniques.
These evaluations could alsobe usedtogauge
students' comfort level in class. All classes
should take part of one day duringthe first few
days ofthe semester, whensyllabiare normally
reviewed, to lay out the foundations for how
students should approach sensitive issues in
class. Additionally, departments should make
a concerted effort to teach material written by
people of diverse backgrounds in their classes.
Lastly, this effort to improve inclusivity
and classroom safety through the alteration
of group discussions, facilitations and
curriculum material should be expanded
to other social science and humanities
departments. While it may be more difficult
to make materials more accommodating in
areas such as math, science and technology,
all departments should make an effort
to promote honest discussion about the
improvements theirstudentsthinkinstructors
should be making to possibly influence
campus racial climate.

Collaboration for the pursuit of justice

ZAHRAA HADI
CSG does not represent me

When you came up to me last year to solicit
my vote, you told me you were "about" social
justice. Alarms went off. You said you cared
about diversity. Alarms went off. You said
racism was wrong, "We all bleed red." Alarms
went off. Throughout the conversations I had
with many of you, the alarms kept going off.
There was this constant buzzing in my head
telling me to stop talking to you. My gut was
telling me to walk away from you as fast as I
could. I ignored it.
I was uncomfortable that you approached me
when I was trying to study.I was uncomfortable
that you invaded my space without asking me if
it was okay to talk to me. I was uncomfortable
that you started throwing around buzzwords
like "racism," "social justice" and "diversity"
before you even asked me for my name. But I
ignored it all. You were nice. I understood that
you were stressed with the elections and that
you were just trying to be heard. I understood
that you were passionate aboutcampus politics;
you wanted to make a difference. And so, I
ignored my feelings of discomfort to give you
a space to talk. I let you into my own, personal
space. I allowed you to push your agenda.
I did not silence you. I did not tell you to stop
speaking. I did not close the metaphorical door
in your face and say "no." I did not laugh at
you for being passionate. Instead, I gave you a
private platform for you to verbalize your hopes
for this campus. Then, when I saw your name
on the ballot, I voted for you. After all, you
seemed like you actually cared. You fooled me.
No, youdid not fool me. Youliedtome.
Yousatthere Tuesdaynight and provedto me
that I should have listened to the alarms. You
care about diversity? You care about racism?
You care about social justice? Then you should
have proved it when hundreds of students
gathered in the Rogel Ballroom, the largest
turnout CSG has had, and listened to what we
had to say. You should have pushed aside your
feelings of discomfort. You should have pushed
aside your cowardice. You should have let us
speak. Instead, you chose to silence us.
I'm a Muslim woman of color, and you
attacked my personhood when you told me I
could not speak.You reiterated violent rhetoric
that told me I was not worthyof addressingyou.
By choosing to silence me, you mimicked what
I have heard time and time again at the Univer-
sity: I have no place here. You stripped me of
any power and agency that I had in this public
space that I considered my home. You left me
crying out in frustration at that wall of silence
you built between us. You told me that it was
"not the United Nations" and that you did not

feel that the CSG hadthe authority to voteon an
issue that students themselves brought to you.
You voted to postpone indefinitely without
actually allowing the authors to introduce
what they were proposing. You said you spoke
to your constituents and asked them what they
felt about it, but you did not ask me. Not one
of you came up to me and asked me how I felt.
Am I not here?DoITnot matter? In fact, you did
not ask any of us. We are students here - why
do you not recognize that? Will we always be
invisible to you?
You destroyed my sense of belonging when
you threw your power in my face and told me
to shut up. You further twisted the knife in my
back when you walked out on me when I was
still trying to talk to you. Your looks of disgust
hurt me. You looked at me, at us, as if we were
animals at the zoo and not passionate students
who just wanted to speak. You kept pounding
that gavel, establishing your authority, and
furthering the fact that you were more relevant
than I was in those proceedings. You turned
your backon me whenI broke down and started
crying out of frustration. You left the room as
I was clawing at my throat trying to get my
words out. You were gone by the time I fell into
my friend's warm embrace and started asking
"Why won't they let us speak? Why don't they
ever let us speak?"
On Tuesday night, you silenced me. You
were directly involved in my oppression and
marginalization as a student of color on this
campus. And before one of you comments
"You're just mad we didn't choose to divest,"
that is not the case at all. To be honest, I
would not have cared as much if you voted
"no" on divestment. I was expecting that.
I was expecting disappointment. I was not
expecting you to postpone the conversation
indefinitely. I was not expecting you to deny
us a platform to speak. ' -
I am upset, disappointed, hurt, but more _
importantly, I am angry. I am angry at myself
for believing you when you said you would try
your hardest to represent me. I am angry at.
myself for giving you a space to speak when I
knew deep down that you would not do the
same. I am angry that I was right. I am angry
at you for lyingto me. You claimed to be my ally,
but yousat there and debated whether or not we
were even worth listeningto.
I am angry, and I am calling for reparations.
I want my cookie back.
You are not my ally.
You do not represent me.
Zahraa Hadi is an LSA senior.

My Jewish values, my belief in
social justice and my feelings about
Israel are all intertwined. I believe
that it is because of Jewish values
such as repairing the world, the
pursuit of justice and many more,
that I feel so deeply rooted in social
justice. It's the combination of these
values, my people's history and my
social justice beliefs that influences
my feelings about the state of Israel.
My feelings about Israel include
love and criticism, pride and
disappointment. I am critical of
many of the decisions the current
government has made concerning
settlement building, socioeconomic
status divides and issues concerning
refugees. But I am also so proud of
Israel's expression of LGBTQ rights,
commitment to sustainability and
secular gender equality. I believe
in, and am committed to, building
Israel into a light onto the nations,
held to a high standard of a Jewish
democracy, which includes justice
for the Palestinian people.
It is also for these reasons that I
am opposed to Boycott, Divest and
Sanctions and the resolution calling

for divestment of Israeli companies
proposed to the Central Student
Government. BDS is a one-sided tac-
tic that strives towards justice for
one people, without acknowledging
other narratives and other efforts
towards a sustainable peace process
that would ultimately lead to jus-
tice for two peoples. I am opposed
to BDS because I believe in posi-
tive change. I am opposed to BDS
because I believe in workingatoward
collaborative efforts with Palestine
and Israel. We can create positive
change on our campus with more
collaboration, dialogue and partner-
ship amongcstudents invested in this
issue. BDS inhibits this opportunity.
The recent language on campus,
including this resolution, articles
in the Daily and mock eviction
notices, has been dividing the
campus, shutting out dialogue and
the opportunity for narratives not
only tobe told, but to be understood
and exchanged. I want to hear more
stories and learn more of the lived
realities of my own fellow students
on this campus concerningthe issue
of Israel and Palestine. I believe

there should also be a respected
place for my narrative in this
circle. But when language is used
to block dialogue and the exchange
of multiple narratives, it's hard for
me to envision the campus climate I
wish to belong to.
I want multiple and diverse
narratives to come together
in peaceful and safe spaces on
campus - where all voices have a
space and are respected - and this
polarizing resolution is bringing
about just the opposite. I believe
we need to continue to strive for
acknowledgement, representation
and respect for all of our students
on this campus and justice for
all citizens of the world - and I
believe this includes a space for
shared diverse narratives. Only
through such collaborative efforts
do I believe we can achieve the
deserving peace for two peoples,
the deserving states for two peoples,
the deserving self-determination
for two peoples and a promising,
socially just future by two peoples.

MEAGAN SHOKAR I
Believe in student government

I hear it time and time again:
"It's just student government - you
don't do anything and you can't
change state or federal policy. It's
not that big ofa deal." Often, when
I talk about the Central Student
Government with my friends, peers
and colleagues, this is the sentiment
I encounter. I can fully understand
this perspective and where it comes
-from, given the years of unpleasant,
contentious elections, paired with
the lack of visibility of CSG in
general. However, I have a slightly
different perspective - a rather
hopeful one.
I believe in student government.
I believe in its potential to better
the quality of daily student life and
to improve campus. I believe in its
ability to work constructively and
respectfully with the administra-
tion to make this institution of high-
er education uphold the ideals that
brought us here in the first place. I
believe in the capability of all stu-
dent leaders to positively challenge
ourselves and our administration
to Make Michigan the school we
all hoped it would be when we were
visiting campus, taking tours and
filling out applications. We had a
beautiful image in our heads for
what we would find when we got to

Ann Arbor and for many of us, our
first days on campus were so unlike
what we had imagined.
My vision for the Central Student
Government is to make substantial,
tangible change tomake all students
happier and more productive; to
engage the student body outside of
campaign season to actually involve
all student voices; to change the
culture on this campus to make
it more inclusive and cohesive. I
want to continue the great work
that current CSG President Michael
Proppe and Vice President Bobby
Dishell have started.
Being involved in student
government is a responsibility
- those elected should be held
accountable for listening to
student voices, maintaining strong
relationships with administration
and taking action on the issues
that students face on this campus.
As Speaker of the Assembly, I
have had the opportunity to work
very closely with some of the most
passionate and dedicated student
leaders at Michigan and I admire
the work they have done. I want
it to continue.
That's why I am involved with
Make Michigan. I'm here to
make this a better campus than

it was when my sister came here,
than when my brother attended
the University, than it has been
throughout my time in Ann Arbor.
when my little brother hopefully
attends the University in a few
years, I want him to have an even
better experience than his older
siblings did. I want this campus to
be safer, healthier, more diverse,
more innovative and more student-
focused for all future Wolverines.
At the end of the day, I'm not
expecting anyone to remember my
name or my face or what I specifi-
cally did on campus. And that's the
way it should be. I want students
to have more faith and confidence
in their government to effectively
represent their interests and Make
Michigan great. I want students to
only remember that student gov-
ernment collaboratively created
services, programs and events that
helped alleviate their daily stress-
es, improved their quality of life
and helped to Make Michigan the
school they had always dreamed it
would be. And I want to help.
Vote Make Michigan on March 26
and 27.

A couple of weeks ago during
spring break, most of my

As a person ERIKA
who spends HARWOOD
her free time -
cocooned
within an electric blanket,
I should have been jealous;
my spring break was spent
struggling to navigate an
unfamiliar city in a heavy coat.
But I wasn't jealous. At all.
Because this unfamiliar city
was Paris, and my somewhat
heavy coat made me feel as chic
as my grandma (my grandma
has killer style, so yeah, I was
feeling great).
If you've so much as seen
me in passing, you could easily
glean that I have a borderline
disturbing infatuation with all
things Parisian as a not-so-

the whole world to see (shout
out to future employers). You
laugh, but I'm not kidding. I've
dreamt of going to Paris since
I was in the womb and over
break, it finally happened -
and yes, my tattoo felt properly
vindicated.
To top it all off - as if God
were real and he actually gave
a shit about crafting Erika's

time I was there (shout out to
God).
So naturally, in between
all the museum visits, Eiffel

what seemed like a nonstop
intake of beaucoup du vin, I,
along with two friends, made
my own brave and noble metro

Jamnesty to raise funds for
Washtenaw County homeless

As busy college students

ever, the University's chapter of
Amnesty International is look-
ing to change this stigma. This
Friday, the organization will
host Jamnesty, a concert event
that aims to raise money and
awareness for the fight against
Ann Arbor homelessness.
LSA sophomore Arielle
Wisbaum, the organization's
external chair, is a key leader
in organizing the event and said
she uses her passion for social
justice to raise discussion about
important topics.
"(Amnesty International)
is a nicer forum for dialogue
because there's a lot of heated
social justice issues right now
on our campus, specifically,"
Wisbaum said. "It's a place
where people feel comfortable
bringing up these issues that
are going on."
The national chapter of
Amnesty International was
established in 1961 anddescribes
itself as "a global movement
of people fighting injustice
and promoting human rights,"
according to their website. It's

Star power can't save this 'Crisis'

Maggie Q and
Mekhi Phifer
discuss blockbuster
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
The Young Adult novel domi-
nates the literature market, and
sci-fi and fantasy have been its
most electrifying genres. Beyond
even literature, this youth-tar-
geted genre has spawned film
franchises, video games and even
Lego sets. For reasons inconceiv-
able to outsiders, fans continue to
swarm global premieres, scream-
ing for autographs and for pic-
tures - one box office record
broken after another. "Divergent"
is a dystopian sci-fi film based on
the Young Adult novel of the same
name, hitting theaters this Friday,
with the promise to thrill audi-
ences as much as ever before.
Earlier this month, The Michi-
gan Daily participated in a screen-
ing of "Divergent" at the Emagine
Theater in Royal Oak, hosted by
actors Maggie Q ("Nikita") and
Mekhi Phifer ("8 Mile").
"To be honest, I saw this film
the other week," Q told the Daily.
"I freaked out ... I had so much
fun! I felt like I went and got
everything I wanted. I had fun,
I was threatened, I was scared, I
was emotional, I was cheering."
Many comparisons have
already been drawn between
"Divergent" and "The Hunger

Games," and rightfully so. Both
involve a young heroine, ordinary
in many respects, trained to fight
to the death, living in a society
divided by castes, called upon to
perform extraordinary acts of
courage. Phifer, too, conceded the
similarity between the two fran-
chises, yet also believes "Diver-
gent" could stand on itsown merit.
"We're basically almost the
same genre, but I think we also
have an adult element that grown
people will reallylike," Phifersaid.
"It just deals with a lot of adult
things. It deals with politics, it
deals with socioeconomics, it deals
with discovery of who you are."
Speaking of discovery, both of
these actors are still learning their
characters; "Divergent" is, after
all, only the beginning of a trilogy.
"We'll just have to see what
Max is up to, I'm curious myself,"
Phifer said. "I don't know what's
gonna happen in number two
or number three. So I'm looking
forward to see it just like you."
As for Q's character, part of her
appeal can be attributed to her
"mystery," as the actress puts it.
"She's an interesting cat," Q
said. "And I think we're gonna get
into her in the next one in a real
way. There's a real strength about
her, but also whenever someone
doesn't give you a lot you're dying
togetmoreoutofthem, and Ithink
that mightbe the case with her."
Both actors agree that
maintaining a consistency in
the portrayal of their characters
throughout the trilogy poses the

greatest challenge to them.
"You're makingsa film decision,
but it's kind of like a TV decision
where you have to decide where
the character is going, and if
that's interesting to you," Q said.
"I thought (the build) for this
character was real."
"Divergent" fans made an
impressive showing at the
Emagine Theater. In the lobby of
the theater was a red carpet along
which fans with outstretched
hands held their copies of the
book. Theycheered, tookpictures,
took home autographs. One girl
came forward and rolled up her
sleeve and asked Phifer to sign her
arm. She had no paper; she'd just
take a picture of her arm.
Phifer can count his son among
these admirers - autograph
notwithstanding.
"He's gonna come with me to
the premiere when we do it in
LA," Phifer said. "This is the first
time he's ever been excited about
me doing anything."
We went into the theater, the
rows filled up, the stars made one
final speech to the fans and the
room went dark. The screen lit
up and the film began. Laughter
was rolling throughout the
runtime, punctuated by the crack
of applause, giggles, whispered
jokes. Of course, much of these
adolescent thrills left older
audiences unfazed, but it was for
the most part, a young audience.
They left that night yabbering,
woozy still, each with their
memories and an autograph.

carry any real intrigue. Most
of the characters are flat and
one-sided. Gillian Anderson

who has this position
ST. PAUL, Minn. - One inch.
Andrew Copp's shot spun like
a coin on the goal line, teasing to
fall across and give the Michigan
hockey team a crucial overtime
winner against Penn State (3-16-
1-0 Big Ten, 8-25-2 overall) in the
first round of the Big Ten Tourna-
ment.
One more inch and the Wol-
verines would have almost cer-

tainly earned an at-large bid to the
NCAA Tournament.
But the puck was kicked out,
and No. 3 seed Michigan was elim-
inated by No. 6 seed Penn State,
2-1, Thursday afternoon, putting
an NCAA Tournament berth in
serious jeopardy.
Forward Zach Saar scored on
a wrist shot at 12:47 of the second
overtime to end nearly 100 min-
utes of hockey and advance the
Nittany Lions to the second round
of the conference tournament.
Michigan (10-8-2-1, 18-13-4)
entered the Big Ten Tournament
No. 11 in the PairWise Rankings.
The Wolverines dropped to 16th
in the PairWise with the loss
and could miss out entirely on
the 16-team tournament if lower
teams earn automatic berths by

winning their respective confer-
ence tournaments.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said he doesn't think his team will
be called on Selection Sunday.
"We'll wait and see on Sunday
where everything ends up," he
said. "When you lose a game like
this, you can'texpect to move up."
Thursday's game remained
scoreless until late in the second
period, when a last-minute offen-
sive possession quickly turned
into a disaster for the Wolverines.
Freshman defenseman Michael
Downing pinched, leaving Penn
State's Taylor Holstrom alone at
center ice. Following a turnover,
the Nittany Lion forward received
an outlet pass and slotted a wrist
shot over freshman goaltender
Zach Nagelvoort's stick side with

just 22.8 seconds remaining until
intermission.
At 11:06 of the third period,
the Wolverines finally responded.
Sophomore forward Boo Nieves
won the puck behind Penn State's
net and slid a pass to junior for-
ward Phil Di Giuseppe, who one-
timed it past goaltender Matthew
Skoff.
"When they got the firstgoal, it
took us quite a while to answer,"
Berenson said. "To get that goal
back was huge. I thought we got
the momentum off that goal."
The game then remained knot-
ted at one until Saar's winner in
the second overtime.
"It was good faceoff play on
their part," Nagelvoort said. "I
went down to cover, and the next
thing I knew, it was in the

net."
Penn State's offensive formula
is relatively simple: Forecheck
relentlessly, throw pucks at the
net and force opponents into had
turnovers. They succeeded in
all of those, resulting in a wide-
open game that featured 118 shots
between the two teams.
Nagelvoort was up to the chal-
lenge for most of the afternoon,
finishing with 63 saves, but the
magic ran out on Holstrom's rush
and Saar's wrister.
"He kept the game close when
we were at our worst and gave us
a chance," Berenson said.
Michigan has played to the
level of its competition .1tl year. It
opened the regular season with a
commanding 3-1 win over No. 3
Boston College and ended it with

a rout of No. i Minnesota. But
sandwiched between those results
came a 5-4 record against Michi-
gan State and Penn State, the Big
Ten's worst teams.
That ineptitude reared its head
again Thursday. The first period
ended without much offensive
firepower from Michigan, which
failed to take control despite a pair
of power plays and a crowd par-
tial in its favor. The Wolverines
ranmped up the intensity in the sec-
ond frame, but they couldn't find
twine and conceded late.
When the exhaustion of two
mnertines had isnkin, the Nittany
Lions final n' elivered the dag-
get. s'initg M i-nigain home early
from the conference tournament
and potentially ending the Wol-
ve-ines' season.

Baseball opens Big Ten Michigan starts Alumni
play vs. conference power Field slate vs. Indiana

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Though its record may not
show it, the Michigan baseball
team has improved this season.
But this weekend, the upward-
trending Wolverines (8-12-1) will
face a major test
in Blooming- Michigan
ton, where they at Indiana
will open Big
Ten play against Matchup:

staff that has
posted a 2.68
earned-run average, which leads
the Big Ten by nearly three quar-
ters of a run.
Senior Joey DeNato is 3-1 on
the year and is the ace of the
rotation. His 1.95 ERA is good
for seventh in the Big Ten, and
opponents are mustering just a
.241 batting average against him
through five starts. Much like the
Michigan pitchers, he goes after
hitters with a power-pitching
attitude, and his strikeout num-
bers reflect that.
The second noteworthy starter
is sophomore Christian Morris,
who is pumping through his out-
ings with a2.75 ERA.
"He's going to mix a fastball,
breaking ball and change-up,"
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich.
"He just knows how to pitch. He's
not out there throwing - he's
pitching. He has a plan, and he's
had a lot of quality starts."
Indiana will send DeNato to
the mound Friday, followed by
Morris and junior Kyle Hart on
Saturday and Sunday, respective-
ly. The Wolverines aren't looking
to do anything differently against

one of the conference's best arms
in DeNato. Theybelieve offensive
success is going to come from
being disciplined and aggressive
at the plate, and that formula will
work against any pitcher in the
country.
Compared to his usual statline,
DeNato struggled in his most
recent outing against Long Beach
State, and Michigan will be look-
ing to capitalize on a rare chink in
his armor.
The Wolverines will counter
with an ace of their own Fri-
day with fifth-year senior right-
hander Ben Ballantine. The team
will look to Ballantine and fel-
low fifth-year senior left-hander
Logan McAnallen to come out
and utilize their veteran presence
to set the tone for the series.
Another high point of the
Hoosiers team is the shutdown
bullpen duo of junior Luke Harri-
son and sophomore Scott Effross.
The pair has given up just six
earned runs through 35 innings
- impressive considering that all
of their appearances have come
in relief.
Though the Indiana pitching
staff stands out with its low ERA,
Michigan is confident rolling into
the weekend with hot bats.
It seems that someone new
steps up inthe Wolverines' lineup
every weekend - last weekend,
that was sophomore shortstop
Travis Maezes. He carried a .500
batting average on the weekend,
popping two home runs and driv-
ing in four.
The Hoosiers carry four hit-
ters who bat above .300. Indiana
is led by juniors Kyle Schwarber
and Sam Travis, who are hit-
ting .352 and .320, respectively.
Schwarber also packs some
power, racking up three home
runs and five doubles.
One area in which the Hoo-
siers struggle is stolen bases.
Junior Casey Rodriguez has six

steals on the season, but no other
player has more than three. In
comparison, Michigan has four
players with at least three steals.
Indiana is a particularly tough
opponent with which to start
Big Ten play. Coming off a sea-
son that saw it reach the College
World Series, it wasn't surprising
when the preseason poll project-
ed Indiana to win the Big Ten in
2014.
"They have the bullseye on
their back in this conference,"
Bakich said. "They're not going
to sneak up on people anymore.
They have a lot of their key play-
ers back from last year, and
they're a team that everyone
knows a lot about, because every-
one in the region followed their
great success story."
Indiana has been in the top
25 for most of the season. It fell
off the list after dropping two of
three to Long Beach State last
weekend. The team rebounded
this week, picking up a midweek
win against-No. 14 Louisville.
But Michigan will do its best
to ensure the Hoosiers don't turn
the lone triumph into a streak.

Carol Hutchins' favorite thing
to do is throw batting practice
with her team. That is, as long as
they're hittingthe ball.
With the Big Ten season start-
ing Friday, the Wolverines' bats
are hitting and the Michigan
softball coach is smiling wide.
The Wolverines (19-6) will see
Indiana in their first conference
series- of the season, and while
the Hoosiers' strength is their
pitching staff, Michigan is now
hitting its stride at the plate.
Senior infielder Taylor Has-
selbach was named Big Ten
player of the week after hitting
.667 with six RBI last weekend
in Louisville, Ky. Though most
of her career has been defined by
timely pinch-hitting and leader-
ship, Hasselbach made the most
of her chance in the lineup and
will look for more opportunities
this weekend.
"Once 1 got into the lineup, the
main thing was just trusting my
preparation," she said. "I just got
into the box and did what I knew

how to do."
Hasselbach's offensive erup-
tion came at just the right time.

Redshirt junior Jon Horford goes up for a shot during Michigan's 57-40 win over Wofford in the NCAA Tournament. A Michigan fan holds up a sign in support of sophomore guard Nik Stauskas during Michigan's first-round game Thursday.
After win, limelight shines on assistant coaches

Jordan, Meyer start
prep for Texas
By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
MILWAUKEE - LaVall Jor-
dan and Jeff Meyer walked off
the court after Michigan's 57-40
win over Wofford Thursday night,
spent time with the team in the
locker room and walked right back
on the court, iPads in hand.
The assistant coaches were
delegated as the scouts for the
Wolverines' game on Saturday -
Meyer chosen to study Arizona
State, while Jordan was assigned
Texas.
Much is made of the physical
rigors of the NCAA Tournament,
with teams playing games in
shorter spans than in the regular
season, but it's just as much an

exercise in study. Instead of hav-
ing weeks to get to know a Big Ten
opponent, inside and out, there's
just about 40 hours to get ready for
a team in the Big Dance.
"It's a challenge," Jordan said.
"But that's why we have smart
guys. I think our guys embrace
that challenge. They like trying to
be the smartest team."
It's not that the coaches are try-
ing to formulate offensive sets and
inbounds plays from watching
the games live as much as they're
trying to get a feel for their future
opponent.
Sometimes a player is listed
as 6-foot-11 when he's closer to
6-foot-9. Coaches also pick up
on play calls signaled on the fly,
which are either not audible, not
visible or both in film.
"Our job is to take what we
see, information we gather metri-
cally and then be able to give them

exactly what they can absorb,"
Jordan said. "You've got to give
them a great idea of what they're
going to face."
But while the coaches are
charged to take in all the informa-
tion they can, they need to pick
and choose what to relay to the
players.
"You always try to give them a
Reader's Digest version of prepa-
ration," said assistant coach
Bakari Alexander, who was in
charge of scouting Wofford. "I
think it's anchored in strengths,
weaknesses, top three scorers,
high-minute guys."
Freshman guard Zak Irvin likes
to know the opponent's style of
play, who the key players are and
what theylike to do.
For sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas, it's important to know
how they defend ball screens. He's
had to deal with Big Ten teams

spending weeks concocting game
plans to limit his production, so it's
a relief for him that in the NCAA
Tournament, teams are too wor-
ried with their previous matchup
to spend much time on that.
As Texas opened up a sizable
second-half lead on Arizona
State Thursday night, Jordan
and Meyer sat in the scouting
seats, tapping away at their
Apple devices and exchanging
observations.
The Sun Devils mounted ; a
comeback and led in the final
minutebut itwas tied with 16 sec-
onds left. Longhorn center Cam-
eron Ridley scooped an offensive
rebound off the floor and laid in
a buzzer beater in prime March
Madness dramatic form.
With the Texas win, Jordan
would have the preparation ready
to give to the team Friday. Though
the focus was solely on Wofford in

the preceding five days, he made
sure to know a bit about the Long-
horns beforehand.
"They've got size, a couple big
guys, alot of height," Jordan said.
"If we do end up seeing them,
that'll be something we gotta
adjust."
The coaches enter scouting
with more or less a blank slate.
The first thing they consider when
they know an opponent is connec-
tions on the coaching tree, such
as Wofford assistant coach Dar-
ris Nichols being a former point
guard of Michigan coach John
Beilein's at West Virginia.
Then, they'll look at the team's
last five games and try to pick up
on tendencies.
"Who are their main scorers,
where do shots come from, how do
they exploit other teams' defens-
es?" Alexander said. "All of those
different things are ingredients

that lead into preparation."
More than any other time in
the season, the fate of a team is
in the assistant coaches' hands in
the NCAA Tournament. Much
else about a game has been made
neutral - the teams are physically
tired, they're on a neutral court
and emotional intensity is peak-
ing.
What differs between teams is
how much one knows about the
other, and how they recalibrate in
response.
Michigan players and staff took
the team bus back to the hotel
shortly after the game Thursday,
but Meyer and Jordan remained
on the sidelines. Like synchro-
nized studiers, they watched the
game with their heads perched
atop their right hand.
The players' days were done,
but it was crunch time for Meyer
and Jordan.

From Page 7
their own schedule, Hutchins
has to trust her squad to main-
tain that focus up until they
gather three hours before game
time.
Beyond the matter of focus,
Michigan will be getting adjust-
ed to its notably fast outfield
after practicing inside for six
weeks.
"Our goal in practice today
was to not let the ball touch the
fence," Hutchins said Wednes-
day. "We have to make sure we're
taking deep angles on the ball."
The Wolverines' veteran out-
field, anchored by senior center
fielder Lyndsay Doyle and senior
right fielder Nicole Sappingfield,
will be used to the adjustment
period. Sappingfield thinks this
team could be farther along
going into conference play than
in years past, and that bodes well
for a team looking for its seventh

straight Big Ten title.
The other member of the out-
field, sophomore Sierra Law-
rence, hassbeen one of Michigan's
strongest presences at the plate
this spring, hitting .355 with
three home runs and 27 RBI.
In the circle, junior pitchers
Haylie Wagner and Sara Dries-
enga will continue to lead the
Wolverines, though freshman
right-hander Megan Betsa has
gotten significant innings in
recent weeks as Driesenga works
out some control issues. Wagner
has led the pack at 13-0, with a
0.93 ERA in 75 innings pitched.
While Indiana figures to be a
bottom-dwelling Big Ten team,
Hutchins insists that the Wol-
verines' focus remains on their
own performance.
"We've spent a lot of time
seeing what kids are capable
of," Hutchins said. "But the
game hasn't changed. The game
doesn't know we're in Big Ten
season and I don't think we'll do
much differently."

The first round of the WNIT

gan women's basketball team

place in the Big TV/Radio:
Ten. This is the MGoBlue.com
first time since
2010 that the Big Ten has sent
nine teams to the postseason. For

the Wolverines, this is the fifth
straight year the program has
earned a postseason bid.
Friday, Crisler willhostthe Sea-
wolves forthe programs' first-ever
matchup. Stony Brook (13-3 Amer-
ica East, 24-8) finished second in
its conference, earning a DivisionI
postseason appearance for just the
second time.
Forward Sabre Proctor, who
reached double figures in scoring
26 times during the regular sea-
son, leads the Seawolves, but two
of Stony Brook's guards, Jessica
Ogunnorin and Chikilra Good-
man, could pose the biggest threat
to the Wolverines. Each was
named to the America East All-
Championship Team, and Good-
man was named the conference's
,Defensive Player of the Year.
Junior guard Shannon Smith
is one of the Wolverines' biggest
offensive weapons. She's averag-
ing a team-leading 14.1 points and
recorded five 20-point contests

duringthe regular season.
"Shannon's probably going to
have the other team's best defend-
er on her - they're going to be
denying her the ball," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico.
"They are probably going to be
trying to double team her at times,
so we need to use her sometimes
as a decoy."
In its first-round matchup,
Michigan's focus will be on finish-
ing the full 40 minutes without
faltering and relying on a number
of different people to make critical
plays.
"Every day, we've been spend-
ing time on end-of-game situa-
tions - up a point, down a minute,
a minute left, 30 seconds, three
seconds left in the game - and
really just working on our confi-
dence," Barnes Arico said.
With late-game control in
mind, Michiganwill need astrong
free-throw percentage - this
season, the Wolverines are 13-4

when making more free throws
than their opponents. Other keys
include 3-pointers and rebounds.
Junior forward Cyesha Goree
is second in program history for
rebounds as a junior (289) and
put up 13 per game at the Big Ten
Tournament. Michigan led the
Big Ten in rebounding during the
regular season.
With the goal of opening up
the court and using different rota-
tions, the Wolverines will look to
rely on sophomore guard Madi-
son Ristovski and freshman guard
Siera Thompson for consistent
free throw shooting. Ristovski is
shooting46.2percentfrombeyond
the are, while Thompson, who set
the record for most 3-pointers for
a freshman in a single season, has
increased her total to 69 this year.
"It shows our growth as a
team," Barnes Arico said. "We're
trying to get better at having
everyone be able to make the play
late in the game."
