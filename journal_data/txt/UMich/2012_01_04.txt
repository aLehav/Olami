EXTRA SWEET

Michigan
wills itself
to victory,
capping
improbable
season
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
N EW ORLEANS
Stop trying to make
sense of it. What happened
inside the Superdome can't be
explained.
The scenes seem disjointed:
third-and-20 conversion, touch-
down, interception, touchdown,
touchdown catch review. The first
55 minutes flashed by ina blur of
yellow and orange pompoms. The
last five and overtime were an
eternity.
I'm not entirely sure how it got
to the point
where Brendan
Gibbons lined
up his 37-yard,
game-winning
field goal. If
you asked me
to rehash the
entire game, I'm
not sure I could. MICHAEL
In the immedi- FLOREK
ate aftermath,
one of the team
assistants ran onto the field.
"This is crazy!" he said, looking
for someone to hug.
I agree. So stop trying to explain
what's been an unexplainable year.
Stop thinking altogether. Here's
what you need to know: That just
happened. Fans, soak in the feel-
ing, even if the events that got you
there are a little hazy.
What this brings, though, is very
clear.
Any questions left for this team
to answer are walking out the door
with the departing seniors. Michi-
gan football is back to being Michi-
gan football.
"We're back," said fifth-year
senior receiver Junior Hemingway.
"Michigan's back."
It was a classic Michigan win,
in an untraditional Michigan envi-
ronment. Instead of the Rose Bowl,
the Superdome provided the back
drop for a not-very-pretty win. The
game wasn't about what the coor-
dinators cooked up. It was back-
yard football, just line up and play.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke's play-
ers vs. Virginia Tech coach Frank
Beamer's players. Who wanted it
more?
"This game was about will," said
offensive coordinator Al Borges.
"The kids played like they played
all year."
In a season that's been defined
by willing themselves to a high

outlasts

Sugar Bowl

NEW ORLEANS - Brady Hoke
leaned in, hugged Junior Heming-
way and gave him a kiss on the
forehead. Hemingway's Most Out- *
standing Player Trophy sat on the
table in front of him, and Hoke
wore a smile as he took his seat.
Earlier, Hemingway cried on his
mother's shoulder while celebrat-
ing Michigan's 23-20 overtime vic-
tory in the Sugar Bowl over No. 13
Virginia Tech. Hoke always said
he'd lead with his seniors, and a
fifth-year senior had capped the
coach's blessed first season with a
win.
"You've got to have guys who
can make those plays, and when
(Denard Robinson and Heming-
way) are the ones doing it, you feel
pretty good about it," said Hoke,
whose team became just the fifth in
modern Michigan football history
to win 11 games.
On a day Michigan amassed
just 184 yards of offense, it wasn't
Denard Robinson or Fitzgerald
Toussaint that saved the day, it was
"Big Play" Hemingway, as Robin-
son calls him. No one will be quick
to call Michigan's win pretty, but
the few plays Michigan did make
came at the most crucial of times,
when the game was in the balance.
The first half had belonged to
Virginia Tech, but Michigan held
the lead. The second half belonged
to the Hokies too, but Michigan had
overtime. When overtime came,
Virginia Tech's third-string kicker
- who had was a perfect 3-for-3 to
that point - missed a 37-yard field
goal. Michigan's Brendan Gibbons
made his 37-yarder.
After the game, Hemingway
found his place on the stage at the
20-yard line, maize and blue con-
fetti falling, right near where he
initially caught in his first touch-
down catch-and-run.
At that point, right was left.
Up was down. And, still, Junior
Hemingway was celebrating in the
end zone.
Call it magic. Call it luck. But
Robinson and Hemingway routine-
ly made plays like this all season.
Robinson had thrown a pick on
just his second pass attempt of the
game, when he lofted a ball toward
Hemingway, who had a one-on-one
matchup. Earlier this week, Robin-
son said he wouldn't second-guess
himself when he looked towards
Hemingway.
"We had a lot of confidence in
that combination," Hoke said.

Romney narrowly defeats Santorum in historic Iowa caucuses

Eight vote margain
separates leading
GOP challengers
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH,
ADAM RUBENFIRE and
ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily News Editors
and Daily Staff Reporter
DES MOINES, Iowa - For-
mer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick
Santorum staged an unexpected
comeback in last night's Iowa
caucuses as the state party chair-
man announced that former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Rom-
ney beat Santorum by the nar-
rowest margin in the history of
the caucuses - winning by only
eight votes.

Iowa Republican Party Chair-
man Matt Strawn announced
Romney as the winner early this
morning,
with Rom-
ney earn-
ing 30,015
votes and
Santorum.
receiving
30,007 of
the more
than 122,000 ballots cast.
Romney's narrow win, coming
in a contest traditionally thought
to be a thermometer for the early
phases of the presidential elec-
tion, could offer clues as to which
candidate will emerge to take on
President Barack Obama in the
fall.
Santorum, at one time a back-
burner candidate, could now

emerge as the top challenger to
Romney, who has long been con-
sidered the frontrunner for the
Republican nomination.
"Game on," Santorum said in a
speech to his supporters in John-
ston, Iowa earlier in the evening
before the final results were
announced.
Romney said he was pleased
with the night's close results as
the campaign now moves to New
Hampshire, which holds its pri-
mary on Tuesday.
"We also feel it's been a great
victory for us," Romney told sup-
porters at the Hotel Fort Des
Moines. In his speech, Rom-
ney turned his attacks toward
Obama, calling his work "a failed
presidency."
"The president may be a nice
guy, but he's just over his head,"

Romney said, stressing his expe-
rience in the private sector as
evidence that he can help revital-
ize the economy.
Santorum's strong perfor-
mance last night might also
establish him as a viable alter-
native to Romney, according to
LSA junior Brian Koziara, exter-
nal vice chair of the University's
chapter of the College Republi-
cans. He said both candidates'
success, though, reflected the
focus of voters on both the econ-
omy and social issues.
"The fact that Romney and
Santorum are the two top vote-
getters and they're so closely tied
shows that in addition to being
very concerned about the social
issues, like Rick Santorum is,
Iowa is equally concerned about

Localizing communil

After interning with the United
Way of Washtenaw County
during the summer of 2010, two
University students decided to
develop a club on campus to get
students more involved with the
organization.
Club president and LSA senior
Andrea Gregorka and LSA senior
Mackenzie Lebeis said Student
United Way currently has about
30 members that help provide
support for community members
in need through volunteer
activities throughout the year.
Gregorka said while United
Way of Washtenaw County
is more fundraising-based,
Student United Way focuses
on volunteer events in the
community. Specifically, the club

aims to provide students with
volunteer opportunities outside
of the United Way Day of Action
- a nationwide day of non-stop
service events in June, which
many students are unable to
attend because it takes place after
winter semester is over.
Gregorka said the club's
presence on campus has
strengthened after a few
semesters of planning, and she
credits its recent growth to
the many leadership positions
offered on the club's board, as
well as an internship opportunity
with United Way of Washtenaw
County offered last semester.
Gregorka added it's an easy way
for students to get involved in the
community because there is no

ty service
specific time commitment, and
students can choose to participate
as much as they would like.
Most recently, the club
volunteered at a kite-making
festival for children and put
together donation boxes for
SOS Community Services, a
housing organization in Ypsilanti.
Gregorka said part of what makes
the experience so special is the
variety of work they do.
"Usually when someone is
homeless, they're also hungry, so
(United Way) works together with
organizations to get someone help
inboth areas," Gregorkasaid. "We
have the opportunity to work
with all the organizations that
help people get back on their feet."

The Local Coordination Com-
mittees, an umbrella group of
activists, put the death toll at
more than 390 people since Dec.

Activists reported more
bloodshed yesterday.
The British-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
said that as dozens of soldiers
were defecting in the southern
village of Jassem, they came
under fire from security forces
in a clash that killed at least 18
of the government troops. The
Observatory said security forces
later launched raids in the area,
detaining more than 100 people
in and around the village.
The group also said security
forces shot dead three people
in the restive city of Homs and
three in the central province of
Hama. The LCC had a higher
toll, saying security forces killed
four people in Homs, one in the
Damascus suburb of Kfar Batna
and four in the central province
of Hama.
The Arab League's chief
acknowledged Monday that
killings have continued even
with the monitors working on
the ground.
The League called an emer-

security forces are still kill-

said. The meeting will be in
Cairo, where the Arab League
is based.
Syrian opposition groups
have been deeply critical of
the Arab League mission, say-

cover for his crackdown. The
LCC says the observer mis-

they move about the country

of the government.

Alain Juppe said the regime

Thousands of North Koreans gather in Pyongyang at Kim II Sung square to hold a mass rally in support for their country's
policies and new leader Kim Jong Un yesterday.
Thousands of North Koreans
gather to celebrate new leader

Kim Jong Un
continues to
consolidate power
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - Pumping their fists and
chanting, tens of thousands of
North Koreans packed the snowy
main square of the capital yester-
day to pledge their loyalty to new
leader Kim Jong Un as the cam-
paign to consolidate his power
deepened.
State television also aired foot-
age of Kim's recent visit to an
elite tank unit with family and
historical ties that showed him
interacting with soldiers with
ease and carrying out inspec-
tions much like father Kim Jong
I1 and grandfather Kim Il Sung
did before him - footage that
aimed to show off his youth and
health and put his confidence and
authority on display.
Soldiers cheered and chanted
his name as Kim made an inau-
gural solo trip to provide "on-
the-spot guidance" in the first
official documentary of the new
leader shown on North Korean
TV.

The campaign to install the
third-generation Kim as leader
has hastened since Kim Jong Il
died more than two weeks ago of a
heart attack, leaving the nation of
24 million in the hands of a young
man who was a mystery even to
the North Korean people until his
emergence in September 2010 as
his father's favored successor.
Since Kim Jong Un, who is in
his late 20s, was made a four-star
general and a vice chairman of
the Central Military Commission
of the ruling Workers' Party, the
campaign to groom him has been
swift. Within a year, Kim Jong
Un had become a fixture at his
father's side for inspection visits
to military units and factories
and at official events.
However, Kim Jong Il's sud-
den death catapulted the son to
the limelight at adelicate time for
North Korea. It was discussing
with Washington much-needed
food aid in exchange for nuclear
disarmament. North Korea has
tested two atomic devices since
2006.
Kim Jong Un did not have the
benefit of 20 years of grooming
like Kim Jong II did when his
father, North Korea founder Kim

Il Sung, died in 1994 of a heart
attack.
Instead, North Korea has
sought to highlight Kim Jong Un's
heritage as heir to North Korea's
founding fathers, underlining his
physical resemblance to the late
President Kim Il Sung and char-
acterizing him as an "identical"
extension of his father.
In the documentary of his mil-
itary visit Sunday, he was dressed
in a long, dark overcoat similar to
the coat his grandfather used to
wear. He is shown in an exhibi-
tion room lined with black-and-
white photos, including an image
portraying a young Kim Il Sung.
The footage also served to
show the confidence of Kim,
who mingled easily with soldiers
and appeared to be giving them
pointers in the documentary
shown just days after the rul-
ing party officially proclaimed
him supreme commander of the
1.2-million-strong Korean Peo-
ple's Army.
Soldiers cheered as Kim
approached, clapping his gloved
hands. He leaned in to pull one
man close to him to share a few
words, leaving the officer in
tears.

decreased in 14 of Michigan's 17
major labor markets.
The figures for November
were released yesterday. Rates
declined everywhere except the
Upper Peninsula and parts of the
northern Lower Peninsula.
The unemployment increases
were seasonal and reflect the end
of the fall tourism season.
The statewide unadjusted job-
less rate was 8.4 percent, down
from 9.2 percent in October.
Rates range from a low of 5.2
percent in the Ann Arbor regioneto
a highof10.6 percentin the north-

C4, a powerful explosive used in
Iraq and Afghanistan to blow the
hinges off doors or destroy unex-
ploded ordinance.
According to court documents,
Atwater told the FBI he is a demo-
litions expert who returned from
his third deployment to Afghani-

Coalition forces to
pull $30B in gear
from Afghanistan
As the pace of the drawdown
of U.S. troops from Afghanistan
picks up in 2012, military plan-
ners are trying to figure out how
to ship huge quantities of alli-
ance vehicles, weapons and other
equipment out of the mountain-
ous, landlocked country.
The operation requires the
removal of $30 billion worth of
state-of-the-art military gear by
the end of 2014, when U.S. and
other coalition troops are to end
their combat role, a senior U.S.
official said yesterday.
Most of the American equip-
ment will be shipped to military
depots in the United States for
refurbishment and then redistrib-
uted to bases around the country.
Some assets will go to bases in
Europe, primarily Germany, or in
Asian nations like South Korea.

Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) fin-
ished third with 21.5 percent of
the vote. Former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich (R-Geor-
gia) finished fourth, with 13 per-
cent, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry
finished fifth with 10 percent of
the vote. Rep. Michele Bachmann
(R-Minn.) finished sixth with 5
percent of the vote.
Paul, Gingrich and Bachmann
vowed to continue their cam-
paigns in New Hampshire, but
Perry said he would return to
Texas to reconsider his options.
Koziara predicted that Gin-
grich would continue to slide,
particularly as Santorum emerges
as the "anti-Romney." Despite the
third-place finish, Koziara said
the results showed Paul would
not be a major contender, add-
ing the caucuses also confirmed
Romney's status as a frontrunner.
Political Science Prof. Vincent
Hutchings said this year's cau-
cuses were unique because vot-
ers in Iowa seemed to focus on
the differences between the can-
didates themselves, rather than
their specific policies.
"Part of the reason that we
have the Iowa caucus is that it's a
sufficiently small state that peo-
ple can get to 'know' their candi-
dates and be familiar with their
positions and make a considered
judgment about which one is the
preferable nominee," Hutchings
said. "But I don't really think
that's what's happening ... if one
would consider policy to be a
priority in making these judg-
ments."
Political Science Prof. Ken
Kollman said a close result like
last night's finish between Rom-
ney and Santorum muddles the
nomination process heading into
the New Hampshire primary.

"We could be in for a long sea-
son here," Kollman said.
Hutchings agreed that a cau-
cus victory alone will not likely
determine the election chances.
"I don't think the other states
are thinking, 'Oh, let's see, Iowa
made this decision. We respect
the decision of Iowa, so I guess
we'll make a comparable deci-
sion,' Hutchings said.
Koziara said a strong showing
in Iowa would boost Romney's
chances in Michigan. Though
Koziara said Romney will likely
win the Michigan primary since
his father, George Romney, was
governor in the 1960s, finishing
well in Iowa would aid Romney's
fundraising efforts.
"I think he's going to win the
Michigan primary regardless,"
Koziara said. "What I think it
does do, though, is give him the
boost in Michigan when it comes
to fundraising. And that's really
what the early winning is about."
LSA senior Amanda Caldwell,
chair of the University's chapter
of the College Democrats, said
she was encouraged by the caucus
polls because they showed a lack
of unity within the Republican
Party.
Caldwell said she was not con-
cerned about Obama's potential
Republican challengers because
the Republican Party has become
too conservative to appeal to
moderate voters.
"The fact that the Republican
party has moved so far to the
right as the primary campaigns
continue on, I think that's going
to be really difficult for them to
overcome in the general elec-
tions," she said.

Taliban opens office in Qatar
to begin talks with the U.S.

Move marks first
public meetings
between parties
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- The Taliban announced
Tuesday that they will open an
office in the Persian Gulf nation
of Qatar to hold talks with the
United States, an unprecedent-
ed step toward a peace process
that might lead to a winding
down of the 10-year war in
Afghanistan.
Although U.S. and Taliban
representatives have met secret-
ly several times over the past
year in Europe and the Persian
Gulf, this is the first time the
Islamist insurgent group has
publicly expressed willingness
for substantive negotiations.
In recent months, the idea
of a Taliban political office in
the Qatari capital of Doha has
become a central element in
U.S. efforts to draw the insur-
gents into such talks. The idea is
to give the Taliban more legiti-
macy to negotiate in a location
that presumably would at least
partly shield them from Paki-
stani pressure.
Asked about the Taliban
announcement, White House
spokesman Jay Carney wel-
comed "any step ... of the
Afghan-led process toward
reconciliation." He noted that
"peace cannot come to Afghani-
stan without a political settle-
ment."
But negotiations could falter

iftheydo notsufficientlyinvolve
President Hamid Karzai's gov-
ernment, which the Taliban
have dismissed as a puppet
regime. Karzai's inner circle
derailed last year's behind-the-
scenes talks, and the Afghan
leader only grudgingly agreed
to the idea of the Taliban's set-
ting up a liaison office in Qatar.
Another potential spoiler is
Pakistan, which houses most of
the Taliban leadership as well
as the Haqqani network, which
carries out major attacks in the
Afghan capital of Kabul. Paki-
stan believes it should have a say
in any talks involving neighbor-
ing Afghanistan, which it fears
will develop an alliance with its
archrival, India.
Pakistan has rejected U.S.
requests to mount an offensive
against the Haqqani network,
and relations between the two
countries are at an all-time low
following a cross-border inci-
dent that resulted in NATO
airstrikes killing 24 Pakistani
soldiers.
As the United States begins
to draw down the nearly
100,000 forces it has in Afghan-
istan, President Barack Obama's
administration wants to use
its current extensive military
campaign and an acknowledged
but incomplete plan for a long-
term American presence in the
country as leverage to draw the
Taliban into talks with Karzai
representatives.
The likelihood that the Tali-
ban will remain a potent fight-
ing force after most foreign


forces leave by the end of 2014
is driving the U.S. and NATO
to seek even an incomplete bar-
gain with the insurgents that
would keep them talking with
the Kabul government.
For the U.S., one goal of such
talks would be to identify cease-
fire zones that could be used as
a steppingstone toward a full
peace agreement that stops
most fighting.
The gradual process of hand-
ing over areas of the country to
Afghan security control would
ideally be marshaled toward
encouraging peace talks, by.
identifying areas where a cease-
fire could be tested, a senior
administration official told The
Associated Press last week.
Obama is hosting a NATO
summit in his hometown of
Chicago in May that will focus
on Afghanistan, and his admin-
istration would like some good
news to announce in an election
year. U.S. officials are always
careful to say that talks with
the Taliban are not a reward for
good behavior, but rather that
they serve American interests.
"You don't negotiate with
your friends," State Department
spokeswoman Victoria Nuland
said Tuesday.
"But this process will only be
successful if those Taliban are
prepared to renounce violence,
break ties with al-Qaida, sup-
port the Afghan constitution
in all of its elements, including
human rights for all citizens,
and particularly for women,"
Nuland said.

Body found in
forest, natural death.
extremely unlikely
LONDON (AP) - A murder
mystery with elements of an
Agatha Christie whodunit is
unfolding at the vast country
estate where Queen Elizabeth II
and her family gathered in rural
splendor to celebrate Christmas
and New Year's.
British police said that a young
woman's body was found in the
forest at Sandringham and that
they are treating it as a murder
case.
An autopsy was conducted
yesterday, but the precise cause
of death was not disclosed, and
investigators have yet to establish
the woman's identity.
The royal family is not impli-
cated in the crime in any way.
The body was discovered by
a dog walker on New Year's Day
three miles (5 kilometers) from
the queen's elegant country
home. Norfolk police said tests
showed the body had been there
one to four months.
Police said a forensic patholo-
gist found that it was highly
unlikely the death was of natu-
ral causes and that there was no
evidence of accidental injury.
Investigators hoped to use DNA
to identify the woman.
The queen and her husband,
Prince Philip, celebrated the hol-
idays at Sandringham with their
children and grandchildren. The
royal couple were still at San-
dringham on yesterday, along
with their youngest son, Prince
Edward, and his wife, Sophie.
Part of the nearly 31-square-

mile (8,000-hectare) estate is
open to the public, and the body
was fouind at Anier, a hamilet of
several dozen people. Situated
115 miles (185 kilometers) north-
east of London, Sandringham has
two stud farms and a fruit farm
and employs more than 100 peo-
ple full time.
Forensics investigators in
white gear were seen walking
through the woods yesterday in
an area cordoned off by police.
"We are at the very early stages
of the investigation and it could
be a complex inquiry," Detective
Chief Inspector Jes Fry said yes-
terday. "The body had been there
for some time."
Fry said authorities were
examining missing-person
reports and unsolved cases
around the country to see if there
were any possible links.
The royal family owns vast
tracts of land throughout Brit-
ain, and it is not unprecedented
for serious crimes to be commit-
ted on property under their con-
trol.
In 2010, the body of a 46-year-
old woman was found on the
crown estate near Windsor
Castle. She had apparently been
killed by hammer blows to her
head. Her estranged husband
was convicted of manslaugh-
ter and sentenced to 26 years in
prison.
Last March, the body of an
American with a royal obsession
was found on an island in the
park opposite Buckingham Pal-
ace. Authorities said Robert James
Moore, who had sent ramblinglet-
ters and strange packages to the
queen, may have been dead for as
much as three years. The cause of
death was not determined.

FROM THE DAIY
The Old Hiie
The 2012 EPEs share their vision for the year
t's strange to think a newspaper has a particular voice, yet
nearly all do. The New York Times describes a center-left and
well-educated New Yorker who enjoys politics and art. The
Detroit Free Press is an advocate for a city and state in dire need
of advocacy. The Michigan Daily's voice, however, has been aptly
described in more unusual terms - a liberal, cranky and fiscally
irresponsible old hippie with a penchant for pot.

The Daily's voice is influenced by prec-
edent set by its stance on a wide array of
issues in editorials that run every day on the
left side of the opinion page. The Old Hippie
has endorsed Republicans and Democrats,
supported military engagement in Libya,
called to remove public officials from office -
including former Assistant Attorney General
Andrew Shirvell - and even written about
the horrors of fire trucks - they're too big,
too red and too loud.
Okay, perhapsthat last one warrants further
deliberation - they do put out fires, after all.
But simply applying a "liberal" label to
the voice of The Michigan Daily is mislead-
ing. Through our editorials, we carefully con-
sider the world around us. We independently
and thoroughly address changes that need
to be made immediately. By respecting past
precedent, we recognize that certain values
in society won't change over time, and we
must continue to promote them. But, we also
acknowledge our world is changing, and are
unafraid to set new precedent or challenge
our previous positions. You can to count on
the Daily to continue endorsing social equal-
ity regardless of orientation, gender or race,
environmental conservation and quality,
affordable education.
More than anything, our voice is unabash-
edly and shamelessly an advocate for stu-
dents - student rights, student interests and
student concerns. As University students
ourselves, we recognize the issues that affect

our classmates and campus community.
The Daily has enjoyed 122 years of edito-
rial freedom, and will continue to use that
right to act as a voice for students. We can
objectively evaluate the institutions around
us - the University, state and local govern-
ment, even The Michigan Daily itself.
The opinion page serves two equally
important purposes: promoting our own
interests and providing a forum for all
aspects of life at the University of Michigan.
It's our job to advocate for students and call
on University administrators and others to
change policy. It's also our job to give every
student on this campus a chance to have their
voice heard; a chance to let others in on their
point of view, even if it's only for 500 words.
This year, we're working to increase the
range of viewpoints presented on our page.
It's an elementary school lesson - a diversity
of perspectives leads to better understand-
ing. To that end, we encourage all of our
readers to contribute to the conversation.
As Editorial Page Editors, we promise to
present content relevant to the University
and Ann Arbor, promote spirited debate and
provide excellent and thoughtful writing. As
readers, we humbly ask you to contribute,
keep us accountable and, most importantly,
read.

Des Moines, Iowa - Before
my time here and in Urban-
dale,

outside the capi-
tal where sev-
eral candidates
set up Iowa x
headquarters,
watching last
night's near tie,
I couldn't decide ANDREW
how I felt about WEINER
the Iowa caucus-
es. The structure
itself isn't difficult to understand
- candidates are running, people
argue in hierarchical meetings and
vote there instead of quietly casting
a ballot. From a distance, it's hard to
understand or rationalize the mas-
sive media coverage that descends
on a usually lethargic state.
If you've turned on a television
or read a newspaper in the past two
weeks, you've seen reporting on the
caucuses. News junkies begin to fol-
low Iowa coverage even before the
Ames Straw Poll in August. Iowa
coverage. The state isn't terribly
demographically or economically
representative of the country. In
2010, the U.S. census found that 91.3
percent of Iowa was white - nearly
20 percent higher than the rest of the
country. At the campaign events we
went to, the lack of ethic diversity
was apparent but unsurprising.
Why pay so much attention? The
question is hardly revolutionary, and
it's part of the answer.
Journalists from around the world
have convened to answer this ques-
tion of "Why?" Stephen Bloom, an
Iowa resident and a visiting journal-
ism professor, is one of many journal-
ists to question Iowa's judgment and
relevance. In a piece for the Atlantic,
he summed it up well: In Iowa, "you'd
never get a dog because you might
just want to walk with [it]. No, that's
not a reason to own a dog in Iowa.
You get a dog to track and bag ani-
mals that you want to stuff, mount,
or eat."
Simply put: New York City and

Washington, D.C. are not Iowa. The
East, West and Southern Coasts
aren't Iowa. Ann Arbor is not Iowa
- I've yet to notice a single yoga
studio here.
Yet, every four years the media
circus ensues. Journalists cover the
caucus in every niche imaginable.
Take the word "circus" literally.
Observing the hundreds of reporters
and media sources in Des Moines is
as much as a spectacle as anything
many are writing.
At Ron Paul's Polk County Whistle
Stop on Monday, I watched a French
reporter and his British cameraman
talk to a man in a vest wallpapered
with buttons and stickers and a
floppy, red Dr. Suess hat. They asked
him what about Paul excited him
and stifled their chuckles when he
answered excitedly, "It's the energy,
man. He's got this thing."
I met reporters from a Danish
newspaper, talked to a German mas-
ter's student at Oxford University
and even shook hands with Ander-
son Cooper. In the Des Moines Mar-
riot, the hot spot for candidates and
journalists, I spoke to New York
Times reporter and University
alum Mark Leibovich. He's one of
about 25 reporters from the news-
paper in Iowa, and he spoke to the
difficulty all journalists face in the
days around the caucus. There are
always niche stories to be written -
an article about Santorum's sweat-
ers comes to mind - but many times
it comes down to journalists fight-
ing over a 10-minute advantage on
a story only slightly different from
countless others.
For student journalists, as the
caucuses approached it was increas-
inglys diffieukito finda istory that
hasn't previously been written by an
expert in the field with more money,
sources and credentials. And if they
didn't write it this week, it was writ-
ten in 2008.
The sheer quantity of press cover-
age is astounding. Trying to keep up
reading and watching it all ranges
from overwhelming to impossible.
When a poll comes out it's not just

point, it's outdated and the results
are irrelevant.
When I spoke to Randy Brubaker,
managing editor at the Des Moines
Register, he described Iowans as
open-minded, friendly and, most
importantly, used to the circus. The
Register becomes nationally relevant
every four years, but still reports on
city council meetings and schools. In

the same vein, Iowans appreciate the
attention, but remain above or below
the national frenzy - it's so 2008.
The reality is the Iowa caucuses
serve two important purposes and
are two distinct but overlapping
caucuses. The capital-C Caucus is
celebrity reporters and interna-
tional camera crews. It's the nation-
al and international media's best
chance to get up close to the candi-
dates, and it's the first opportunity
for the country to get to know them
in painstaking detail.
The lowercase-C caucus is Iowans
voting for their presidential nominee
- they just happen to do it first. Yes,
the candidates put in more effort in
and pretend Iowan interests aretheir
own. Yes, the average Iowan has
shakenthe hand of Ron Paul - twice.
But in the end, 7 p.m. on Jan. 3rd is
just a calendar appointment for about
10,000peoplel. e
Iowa is a big deal because the
capital-C caucus makes it big. The
media creates a monster from a crea-
ture that left alone probably wouldn't
have such sharp teeth. Is itcdeserving
of the attention? Probably not. Is it
fun anyway? You betcha.

The value of privacy online

As the NewYear greets us, many have decid-
ed to make resolutions. Maybe your resolution
is to work out more or pull fewer all-nighters.
Maybe it's to get along better with your room-
mates or to gossip less. One of mine is to have
less computer screen time. After a hiatus from
Facebook during finals week and the holidays,
I'veenjoyedameasurable amountofrelieffrom
avoiding pointless statuses, embarrassing pho-
tos and targeted advertising. My victory was
certainly a hollow one however, as I deactivat-
ed my account with the full knowledge that all
of my content would be readily available if - or
rather, when - I decided to get back on the bus.
It's no secret that Facebook - so easy and
comprehensive when chatting with friends or
posting pictures - becomes a quagmire when a
user attempts to disengage or ultimately delete
their profile. The issue boils down to a matter
of privacy rights. There is no set of rules that
apply across the board when it comes to pro-
tecting (read: not selling) customer content. It
becomes even trickier when the things a per-
son puts onto the site may not actually belong
to them, even though it was entered and saved
under their name.
A recent Washington Post article discussed
content ownership and how it related to per-
sonal privacy. When Friendster and Google
Buzz shut down they each informed users that
they would not be deleting their data. Their
inaction raises the suspicion that this informa-
tionwillbe auctioned offto prospective buyers.
Of course, whenever you enter your personal
information into a website, you risk the danger
that your information could be sold to a third
party. Sometimes, the company will assure
you during registration that personal informa-
tion will not be accessed by anyone else, but
it seems that bankrupt businesses play by dif-
ferent rules. In the case of a site for gay teens
called XY, a sale of information was stopped by
the FTC. Borders, however, successfully sold
its compilation of customer history to Barnes
and Noble after it went bankrupt last fall.

Not only is privacy a problem for those of us
who wish to simply protect our information,
but the same is true for users attempting to
maintain control of their content. Kodak Gal-
lery, a site for posting and maintaining photo
albums, may soon lose control over the millions
of personal collections uploaded to its servers.
According to a November 3rd article in USA
Today, Eastman Kodak predicted a $400-$600
million loss for the 2011 year. If the company
were to sell or file for bankruptcy, their new
owner would decide what to do with users'
content. Those who post their comings and
goings to Gowalla, a social network special-
izing in contact through location sharing, are
witnesses to a different situation. The social
network is integrating into Facebook in the
near future, and current Gowalla content will
be lost. At that time, userswill no longer be able
to access their posts. However, Gowalla has
informed its customers that they can save their
data through a downloading process.
My retreat from the Web world couldn't
have been complete even if I tried. In addi-
tion to Facebook's sneaky policies, I also have
a Myspace profile to worry about. I know the
avatar of my 14-year-old self is floating out
there somewhere, and I'm shuddering just
thinking of her inevitable kissy faces. The
solution for those of us with skeletons in the
closet - whether we're trying to wrest own-
ership or finally bury them - lies in passivity.
Don't worry too much about your Web woes
and think twice the next time you want to sign
up for a file sharing or social media site. Your
own digital footprints are more pervasive than
you think, and are probably accessible through
a search engine. This is 2012, and technology
is everywhere - the computing cloud hangs
over us. It follows us wherever there is Wi-Fi.
Those who haven't yet should probably antici-
pate surrendering.

This is not a column about
Mitt Romney's results in
yesterday's Iowa caucuses.
This is a column

of people we are allowed to hate.
Over and over when asked who
they intended to support in the
presidential primary race, a certain
kind of Republican voter answered,
"Anyone but Romney." The spec-

Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann,
Rick Perry, Herman Cain, and Newt
Gingrich again make sense only as
manifestations of that sentiment.
The last candidate who generated
similar personal animosity was Hill-
ary Clinton. A huge part of Barack
Obama's appeal in 2007 was that
he was not Clinton. Romney's flaws
as a candidate - flat delivery and a
mixed partisan record - are very
different from what led Democrats
away from Clinton.

From Page 1A
the half winding down, Rob-
inson had Kyle Fuller, Virginia
Tech's best cornerback, reach-
ing for his ankles. But the junior
quarterback reloaded and fired
off his back foot as two more
Hokies crashed into him.
The ball floated. Virginia Tech
safety Eddie Whitley whiffed on
the pick, while his teammate,
Antone Exum, was two steps out
of place. The ball landed neatly in
Hemingway's hands. The fifth-
year senior raced for a 45-yard
touchdown.
For Robinson, it was anoth-
er head-scratching decision
that turned out OK. Borges has
resigned himself to the fact that
his quarterback doesn't always
listen to the advice he gave him
before the season: "Make plays
* and let God do the miracles."
"Sometimes he elbows God
outta the way and decides he
wants to do it anyway," Borges
said.
On that play, Michigan inex-
plicably took its first lead, 7-6.
Virginia Tech quarterback
Logan Thomas had put on an
aerial show, lasering passes in
and around a Michigan second-
ary that lived almost exclusively
by the motto "bend, but don't
break." His favorite target was
receiver Danny Coale, who was
a nuisance for the Michigan sec-
ondary all game.
And Thomas's running back,
ACC Player of the Year David
Wilson, found room on the edges,
where so many teams exploited
Michigan this season.
On defense, the Hokies' front
seven blitzed Robinson, contain-
ing him to modest gains. Tous-
saint's quickness wasn't always
* enough, either.
Virginia Tech had more yards
in the first half than Michigan
did the entire game (185), but
the Hokies were held to just six
points due to an opportunistic
Michigan defense and timely
mistakes.
"This defense made this game
happen," said redshirt sopho-
more tackle Taylor Lewan.
"Because God knows our offense
didn't."
On Virginia Tech's first drive
of the game, facing alfiaat'owa l
and'goal with the ball, on their
own 4-yard line, Wilsonbounced
outside. But he quickly aborted
the original plan, as his offensive
line lie obliterated on the ground.
Thomas Gordon, Craig Roh, Jor-
dan Kovacs, Jibreel Black and
Jake Ryan stared him down like
a pack of foaming dogs. Relent-
less, they chased Wilson as he

retreated.
Briefly, Wilson entertained
the thought of running around
them. But Ryan accelerated,
wrapping Wilson and hurling
him down 22 yards from where
the play started.
Virginia Tech settled for a
field goal.
Then, with a chance to demor-
alize Michigan and build on a
6-0 lead, facing a fourth-and-1
again on the Wolverines' 4-yard
line, Thomas tried to sneak the
ball himself. Fifth-year senior
defensive tackle Ryan Van Ber-
gen stuffed him.
Virginia Tech came away with
no points.
After Hemingway's touch-
down catch - and right on cue
- senior special teamer J.B.
Fitzgerald forced a fumble on the
kickoff and Michigan tacked on a
field goal.
Early in the second half, the
defense complemented "Big
Play" Hemingway again. Fresh-
man defensive end Frank Clark
snatched a screen pass out of the
air, and four plays later Heming-
way was celebrating.
Robinson threw the ball high
and far, where only Hemingway
could reach it. He tiptoed the
sidelines and came down with
the catch. The play was reminis-
cent of his missed opportunity at
Iowa, when Hemingway couldn't
come down in bounds with a
high pass.
In his head, he thought:
"Please, Denard, throw this up.
Please, I want you to so bad."
The 17-6 lead allowed Michi-
gan breathing room, as Thomas
led the Hokies back with two
consecutive scoring drives - a
field goal and a touchdown. A
beautiful pass to the back of the
end zone converted the two-
point conversion, tying the game.
But Michigan no longer need-
ed "BiggPlay" Hemingway's ser-
vices.
Coale, who kicked in high
school, was called upon to punt
earlier in the game for the Hok-
ies. He was no slouch kicking
the ball, but with the game tied
17-17 midway through the fourth
quarter, Virginia Tech coach
Frank Beamer elected to call the
fake.
The Wolverines had trouble
covering the Hokie receivers and
slowigg)eThomas's qnasterbalc1
runs, butthey snuffed Coale's
run out. Then Gibbons nailed a
39-yarder, which was enough to
get Michigan to overtime.
His teammates knew Heming-
way had carried them there.
"Real big impact," Toussaint
said. "I'm kind of speechless
about that. He was outstanding
tonight."

FLOREK
From Page 1A
place, it was the perfect capper.
The Wolverines probably didn't
"deserve" to have the season
they did. They probably didn't
"deserve" to be in the Sugar
Bowl. They probably didn't
"deserve" to be in this game
after the first quarter.
They willed themselves to
this victory just like they willed
themselves to this season.
It was a year ago tomorrow
that Dave Brandon started his

coaching search. He found a
man in Brady Hoke who willed
himself to live his dream and
become Michigan's head coach.
He took largely the same play-
ers that went 15-22 over the
past three seasons and willed
them to believe in this one.
They showed how far they
came in front of the nation
Tuesday night. Fifth-year
senior center David Molk
was ruled out of the game in
warm-ups after a foot injury.
He missed three plays. Fifth-
year senior Ryan Van Bergen
had his foot bent parallel to

his shin. Then had it bent the
other way. He couldn't make it
around after the game without
the help of crutches. He didn't
miss a snap.
"That's the why we've won 11
games," Hoke said of the team's
resolve.
That's what good teams
do. Teams that go to Rose
Bowls and win national titles
and beat their rivals out-will
evenly matched opponents.
The memories of the Michigan
of yesteryear aren't about great
play-calling. What's remem-
bered are the moments where

battles are won. Tuesday night
was a battle.
And in the end, the entire
team stormed the Sugar Bowl
stage. They wore flat-brimmed
hats and giant T-shirts, there
were no Roses in their mouths.
Adding in the specially made
Sugar Bowl jerseys made it
obvious that this wasn't the
wardrobe of the teams of the
past.
Slowly, the chant started.
"It's great...to be...a Michigan
Wolverine"
But they sure looked and
sounded like them.

Student voters come out In
low nu-mbers for Iowa caucus

U.S. forces start

Youth show general
lack of support in
Hawkeye State
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH and
ADAM RUBENFIRE t;,
Daily News Editors
DES MOINES, Iowa -
Despite being held on Drake
University's campus, most cau-
cus-goers in attendance atpre-
cincts 45 and 46 in Polk county
were not students.
About 215 people came out
to caucus at Olmsted Hall on
Drake's campus here yesterday
evening. While many students
helped staff the event, few came
to vote, leaving a majority of the
caucus populated by elderly and
middle-aged adults.
In Polk county, where Drake
is located, former Massachu-
setts Gov. Mitt Romney won
with 28.4 percent of the vote,
followed by Rep. Ron Paul
(R-Texas) with 22.6 percent of
the vote. Former Pennsylvania
Sen. Rick Santorum, who fin-
ished second state-wide after a
late surge in the campaign, fin-
ished third in Polk County with
21.6 percent of the vote.
Aside low student turnout at
Drake, there also was a general
lack of college student support
at many campaign events in
state-wide preceding the cau-
cus. Very few students attended
a campaign event for Romney in
Clive, Iowa Monday night and
Rock the Caucus - an event held
in West Des Moines to garner
youth support yesterday morn-
ing - was restricted solely to
high school students.
Even a downtown Des
Moines whistle-stop for Paul,
the libertarian-leaning candi-
date who particularly boasts
his campaign's youth support,
lacked in student attendance.
In an interview before the
caucus, Drake sophomore Sam
Pritchard, caucus chair for the

two precincts at Drake, said he
expected about 200 people in
total at the event, but was skep-
tical regarding student turnout.
Pritchard said student turn-
out was because many students
are still on Winter Break.
J "That}was rpally damaging
to the kind of influence that we
were able to give students at
Drake," Pritchard said.
John Michael Hall, a 2009
graduate of Drake who caucused
at Olmstead, said he under-
stands why college students
may not vote in droves, noting
he feels differently about politi-
cal issues as a graduate than he
did while still in school.
"When you're in college ...
you don't seem as affected by a
lot of the policy and ... legislation
that's being passed," Hall said.
"... I think more than anything
it's just maturing and getting to
stage in your life where these
things are more important."
Hall attributed his
increased interest in policy
to beginning to experience
political issues firsthand in
the real world.
"I think they were just as
important then, I just wasn't
as aware," he said.
Pritchard said Drake Uni-
versity hosted its first straw
poll this election season, and
according to the University's
research, it was the largest
college straw poll in the coun-
try during the current elec-
tion cycle, with over 1,200
students participating.
According to poll results,
Pritchard said the university's
student body is "mirrored"
in terms of party affiliation,
with 40 percent identifying
as "some type of Democrat,"
41 percent identifying as
"some type of Republican,"
and 16 percent identifying "in
the middle."
"It surprised me how
perfectly balanced it is,"
Pritchard said.
Pritchard argued that stu-

dents stand to benefit more from
caucuses than ballot-style pri-
mary elections.
"(In) a primary you're act-
ing as an individual, in a caucus
you're acting as something big-
ger than that," Pritchard said.
} Drake sophomore Lucas Osh-
man, a non-voting observer at
the caucus, said he thinks the
caucus structure is particularly
conducive to college students.
"If you're looking at the way
a university works, a caucus
would be more in line with
what a Uuniversity would want
to do rather than a private pri-
mary because it allows people
to speak their minds, which is
what a lot of people do at a uni-
versity," Oshman said.
Drake senior Zach Seeman
said he finds the caucus atmo-
sphere refreshingly social,
allowing caucus-goers to min-
gle and discuss their political
beliefs.

"The nice thing about cau-
cuses is that you get to function
as more of a group, and its nice
because you get to meet fellow
supporters," Seeman said, add-
ing that he spent much of the
night debating with a fellow
Drake student who came to the
caucus in support of Santorum.
Seeman donned a bright red
Ron Paul shirt throughout the
caucus, and even helped staffers
pass out pencils. He said he was
happy that Paul supporters at
Drake coordinated over e-mail
to garner support for the cau-
cus, especially since Paul won in
student-heavy precinct 45.
Though student turnout
at Drake was not incredibly
high, he said young people are
important to the Paul campaign
throughout Iowa.
"Elsewhere in the state, defi-
nitely the youth vote for Ron
Paul has an effect in the cau-
cus," Seeman said.

Military learning
CIA intelligence
* tactics
FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) - A
scene of stomach-clenching gore
confronted the special operations
troops: The shredded remains of a
suicide bomber, scattered around
the checkpoint.
But the blood and body are
fake, like the Hollywood-style
explosion that began a classroom
exercise designed to teach these
students to look past the grisly
mess for the evidence that could
lead to those who built the bomb.
Ft. Bragg's Special Warfare
Center shows how the U.S. has
turned hunting terror networks
into half-science, half-art-form
since the al-Qaida attacks of Sept.
11th. Forging lessons painfully
learned in the decade since into a
formal curriculum, the training
is intended to help elite military
units track militants across inter-
national boundaries and work
alongside sometimes competing
U.S. agencies.
The coursework is similar to the
CIA's legendary spycraft training
center called The Farm, and is at
the brainchild of Green Beret Maj.
Gen. Bennet Sacolick, a veteran of
elite special operations units, and
a long stint on loan to the CIA.
Among the students at the
CIA-approved Ft. Bragg course
are U.S. Army Green Berets, Navy
SEALs and Marine Corps special

operators. As in the Navy SEAL
raid that killed Osama bin Laden,
everything from computers to fin-
gerprints can be retrieved from a
raid site and quickly analyzed. In
some cases the analysis is so fast it
can lead to several newtargets in a
single night.
The school is also an illustra-
tion of how special operations and
intelligence forces have reached
an easier coexistence, after
early clashes where CIA officers
accused the military operators of
ineptly trying to run their own
spy rings overseas without State
Department or CIAknowledge.
"As my guys go to Afghanistan,
and interface with CIA base and
station chiefs, they can do it with
more credibility than in the past,"
Sacolick told The Associated Press
in a rare interview.
While many in the public may
not be aware that the military is
allowed to gather information,
and even run its own spy net-
works, special operations forces
have been authorized to do just
that since the disastrous Desert
One raid meant to rescue the U.S.
hostages held in Iran in 1979. The
raid went awry because of a heli-
copter crash, not an intelligence
foul-up. But before the raid, mili-
tary planners had been frustrat-
ed that CIA employees working
inside the country were unable to
provide them the tactical intel-
ligence needed to insert a covert
force - even basic information
like which way the streets ran out-
side the embassy.

Putin proposes new trade-
focused Eurasian Union

Los Angeles firefighters battle an arson car fire under a carport in Los Angeles Monday. Twelve suspected arson fires
broke out early Monday in the Los Angeles area.

after arsons terrorize L.A.

Russian plan
garners mixed
responses from
former Soviet states
ALMATY, Kazakhstan (AP)
- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin has a vision for
a Soviet Union-lite he hopes
will become a new Moscow-
led global powerhouse. But, his
planned Eurasian Union won't
be grounded in ideology: This
time it's about trade.
The concept of regional eco-
nomic integration may be los-
ing some of its allure in Europe,
where a debt crisis is threaten-
ing the existence of the euro-
zone. But some countries across
the former Soviet Union, still
struggling economically 20
years after becoming indepen-
dent, are embracing Putin's
grand ambition.
Russia has moved one step
toward this goal under an agree-
ment with former fellow Soviet
republics Belarus and Kazakh-
stan that as of Sunday allows
the free movement of goods and
capital across their common
borders.
As Putin envisions it, the still-
hypothetical union will eventu-
ally stretch from the eastern

fringes of Central Europe to the
Pacific Coast and south to the
rugged Pamir Mountains abut-
ting Afghanistan.
The drive to somehow reform
at least a husk of the Soviet
Union has been around since
1991. The Commonwealth of
Independent States, which
loosely brings together 11 of
the original 15 republics, was
an early attempt that never
amounted to much more than a
glorified alumni club.
It was Kazakhstan's Presi-
dent Nursultan Nazarbayev who
first raised the notion of an Eur-
asian Union in the early 1990s,
but the idea was too premature
for nations busy forging their
own delicate statehoods.
Putin was president from
2000 to 2008 and intends to
regain that position in a March
election. A wave of protests that
began after a fraud-tainted par-
liamentary election in Decem-
ber is posing the first serious
challenge to Putin's authority,
but his hold on power still seems
secure.
In anticipation of a new six-
year term as president, Putin
has made forming a Eurasian
Union by 2015 a foreign policy
priority. He is promoting the
union as necessary for Russia
and its neighbors to compete in
the modern global economy. His

broader goal is to restore some of
Moscow's economic and politi-
cal clout across former Soviet
space and thus strengthen Rus-
sia's position in the world.
If the poorer prospective
members are clamoring for
Putin's union so as to become
Moscow's financial benefi-
ciaries, as was the case under
the Soviet Union, they may be
sorely disappointed. Russia has
in recent years taken a more
pragmatic line when extend-
ing its largesse and that stance
is expected to remain largely
unchanged.
"Some years ago, Russia came
to the position that assistance to
former Soviet republics should
be monetized," said Ivan Saf-
ranchuk, an associate professor
at the Moscow State Institute of
International Relations.
Safranchuk said this meant
that Moscow issued lines of
credit and then sold countries
oil, gas, electricity and military
hardware at discount prices.
That strategy has brought
Russia closer to gaining control
over energy infrastructure in
Ukraine, Belarus and Kyrgyz-
stan. While giving Moscow eco-
nomic leverage over its former
subjects, this approach has pre-
cluded the exorbitant spending
pressure that helped bankrupt
the Soviet Union.

Burkhart's mother
arrested last week
on fraud charges
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Harry
Burkhart watched as his mother
was arrested last week on fraud
charges from their native Germa-
ny, and a day later he exploded in
an expletive-laced rant against the
U.S. at her courthearing.
That's when, authorities
believe, Burkhart, angry over his
mother's legal troubles, went on
a nighttime rampage of arson
attacks that terrorized Los Ange-
les and caused $3 million in dam-
age.
Court documents unsealed yes-
terday said Dorothee Burkhart,
who is in her 50s, was charged
with 19 counts of fraud in Frank-
furt, including failing to pay for a
2004 breast-augmentation sur-
gery and pilfering security depos-
its from renters.
In a brief court appearance, she
appeared perplexed, wondering
aloud if her son had disappeared
or was dead. At one point, she said,
he is mentaly ill and questioned
whether Nazis knew where she
and her son lived.
"Where is my son? What did
you do to my son?" she asked U.S.
Magistrate Judge Margaret Nagle.
Harry Burkhart, 24, was being
held without bail after being
arrested in the arson case Mon-

day. His mother also is being held
without bail and her court hear-
ing was delayed until Friday so
she can hire an attorney.
Outside his Hollywood apart-
ment, some neighbors described
him as a loner who loitered
around the busy commercial
strip at night and could be heard
arguing with his mother.
But Shlomo Elady, a hair stylist
who regularly trimmed Burkhart's
long hair, recalled someone who
spoke three languages, dreamed
of visiting Jerusalem and cared for
a sickly mother who had trouble
walking.
Elady said he was stunned that
the man wholived with his mother
above his Sunset Boulevard shop
is suspected of torching vehicles,
some just steps from his home.
"He loved his mom, the way
every son loves his mom," Elady
said. "He's not a creepy guy."
Burkhart was taken into custo-
dy after authorities received a tip
from federal officials who recog-
nized him in a security video that
showed a pony-tailed man emerg-
ing from a garage where a car was
set ablaze.
"When they saw the security
footage, they recognized him and
they contacted the arson task
force," a State Department offi-
cial told The Associated Press,
speaking on condition of anonym-
ity because the investigations are
ongoing.
Burkhart had been living in

the U.S. when his mother arrived
in October and went with him
to the German consulate in Los
Angeles to renew his passport,
accordingto court documents.
Authorities didn't say how
long Burkhart had been in South-
ern California, but both mother
and son had the appropriate legal
documents.
A federal law enforcement
official, speaking on condition of
anonymity because the official
was not authorized to discuss
the case, said Harry Burkhart
was present when his mother
was arrested Dec. 28 on a provi-
sional arrest warrant.
Provisional arrest warrants
are normally issued when there
are criminal charges pend-
ing overseas against someone.
Ordinarily, U.S. authorities then
obtain an arrest warrant through
the State Department and the
Justice Department.
Burkhart had been in court
Thursday afternoon. Harry
Burkhart launched into an
obscenity-laden tirade, saying
"F--- the United States!" said
Thom Mrozek, spokesman at
the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles.
Mrozek said Burkhart was
detained and later escorted out
of the courthouse. He said Bur-
khart did not make any specific
threats against anyone or prop-
erty at his mother's court hear-
ing.

Canadians began needing

Customs and Border Protection
says it only accepts a passport,
an enhanced driver's license or
a Nexus pass from Canadian cit-
izens entering at land crossings.
The list doesn't mention facsim-
iles, like scans and photocopies.
A spokesman for the depart-
ment did not immediately
respond to questions on wheth-
er scanned passports are also
commonly accepted at U.S.
points of entry.
Reisch, 33, said he took
a scanned photo of his

it was over lost or stolen
while traveling. He said he
also successfully used the

on the way home later that

He said he doubts he'd get

bring his passport next time.
But he hopes border officials
will eventually make digi-
tal identification an official
form of travel document.
He noted that many airlines
now accept digital board-
ing passes stored on smart-
phones.
"I see the future as 100
percent being able to cross
with your identity on a digi-
tal device - it's just a matter
of time," he said.

None of it is a proper substi-

lacks, or the audience's frus-

a better film released to well-
deserved acclaim, spawned a
trilogy that concluded less than

they shouldn't hold their collec-

Tom Cruise ("Knight and Day"),

But let's talk about Cruise for a
minute. There's no doubt the man
has still got what it takes to be
Ethan Hunt. And yet the current
state of his career has often come
into question. This installment of
the "Mission: Impossible" series
makes one realize just how much
of this anti-Cruise bias stems
from his personal, not profes-
sional, life. Because as far as this
film was concerned, no twenty-

The funny thing is, who would
have thought Brad Bird would be
the man to shoulder the weight
of both a faltering franchise
and megastar on his shoulders?
Directing a non-animated movie
for the first time, Bird spared no
expense in finance or imagina-
tion. From one of the best prison-
break scenes captured on film in
recent years, to the extravagant,
unimaginable bombing of the
Kremlin and subsequent action
sequences, this movie is action-
packed and breathtaking from
start to finish. Add in Cruise's

"War Horse" is
a battlefield trying to wear the
constraints of a children's movie.
It simply doesn't fit.
The first part of the film,

out like a tired riff on any num-

old-fashioned sentimentality.
Then World War I strikes, and
young, brave soldiers march off
to the muddy trenches of France
to fight and die. It was a war of
unimaginable destruction - the
war thought to end all wars.
That's the sort of monster
Spielberg is dealing with, but
the audience is never dealt that
visceral punch. Just think of
Spielberg's own "Saving Private
Ryan." Who could forget that
opening scene, those infamous
shots of men crying for their
mothers? "Saving Private Ryan"
was a vicious beast indeed. But
in this story, centering around a
horse named Joey lost in the bat-

rors are found.
That's not to say there's a
bloodlust quota that war films
must fill in order to satisfy the
audience, but the full effect of
violence is needed. This is exem-

Denard develops as a leader or re-emerging 'A'

*I

NEW ORLEANS -
enard Robinson has a
shtick he plays outwith
his center, Dave Molk.
This week, as the two prepared for
the Sugar Bowl, they made their
rounds, meeting with the media
and making appearances that may
have seemed
uncomfortable
for the soft-
spoken Robin-
son or ornery
Molk.
At a hospital
visit, Molk
spied a line of TIM
aimingcam- ROHAN
eras, and play-
fully pushed
Robinson
towards them. Hey, Denard wants
his picture taken! You all want
Denard's autograph, right?
Robinson bashfully laughs it off,
then jokes that Molk - perhaps the
Michigan player who most despis-
es public appearances - is who
they should heap the attention on.
As the week unfolded, it was
clear that Robinson's fame fol-
lowed him to New Orleans. It
was common to see him juking
bystanders on the street, racing
to get backto his group, having
stopped to take so many photos
with fans. Some players werebrave
enough to wear their gray Michi-

gan jumpsuits. Had Robinson not
worn casual clothes, he may have
grown claustrophobic.
It took some getting used to.
At first, he was only recognized
around his small hometown of
Deerfield Beach, Fla.
Now, the world is watching him,
and him alone, no matter where
the team goes.
"Denard has rock star status
everywhere," Molk said. "If he
went to the grocery store, he'd had
rock star status. I mean, he's just
stuck because of who he is and all
that kind of stuff.
"It's hard for him. I remember
him telling me one time, when
he orders a pizza he can't give his
name because then he'd have three
guys show up at the door trying to
talk to him."
Instead of passing his fans with
a simple nod, Robinson takes the
time other stars wouldn't.
"I speak to everybody," he said.
"I mean, I enjoy people. The one
thing about me, I lovebeing around
people and love talking to people. I
just have fun with it."
One fan down in New Orleans
called him "Bernard," which made
the quarterback laugh. Countless
others will leave with a brief per-
sonal memory with him that they'll
cherish.
It should come at no surprise
that Robinson is the most rec-

coach was briefedby Sheri Acho,
formerlythe academic support
director. She told Carr, "You're
going to love this kid, because he's
really a dynamite person."
They talked for half-an-hour.
"I came away feelingshe was
exactly right," Carr said. "He's an
impressive guy."
Around the team, he's evenbet-
ter. It's understood he's thebest
recruiter, the go-to guy for hosting
players on visits. His teammates
respect him, and players older than
Robinson say they look up to him.
When Robinson's asked about
his own success, he credits others
almost too much - this week he
said he throws to the best receiv-
ing corps in the country. He's his
own biggest critic, alwaysbeating
himself up, his teammates say. It's
how he smiles through those dark
moments - like the interceptions
and injuries - that impresses
Carr.
"I think he's justbeen a sensa-
tional representative of Michigan
football," Carr said. "He's handled
the good and thebad.
"And when things didn't go
well, he handled it extremely well.
Which, to me, is really an impor-
tant sign. Because thatshows
maturity. He hasbeen extremely
impressive."
Off the field, his personality fit
the part. The next step wasbecom-

ing a better leader on it - some-
thing Robinson says is a work in
progress, as isbecoming a better
passer. Molk and senior captain
Kevin Koger told him he had tobe
more vocalthis season. Robinson
couldn't just leadby example as the
quarterback.
Next year, there won'tbe many

DANIEL
WASSERMAN

New Year's resolutions dur-
ing the past few years probably
looked a lot different than yours
or mine. And with each new year,
Burke's new resolutions probably
changed drastically every year.
Let's take a look:
2009: As a high school sopho-
more, Burke was already the
starting point guard for power-
house Northland High School in
Columbus, who would go on to
win the 2009 Ohio state champi-
onship. But while his teammate
Jared Sullinger was one of the
nation's top recruits, Burke was
receiving little attention from
college coaches.
New Year's resolution: Work
harder in hopes of gaining rec-
ognition and earning scholarship
offers.
2010: If Burke's resolution
in 2009 was to get noticed and
receive scholarship offers, then
his resolution was a success. In
October of 2009, he committed
to Penn State. The Nittany Lions
hadn't made the NCAA Tourna-
ment since 2001.
New Year's resolution: Work
body into college-ready shape
to make an early impact at Penn
State and lead the Nittany Lions
back into March Madness brack-
ets.
2011: Burke continued to
improve his own game, eventu-
ally winning Mr. Basketball
in Ohio. But as his numbers
continued to increase, so did
the quantity and quality of his
scholarship offers. While Penn
State may have seemed like
an ideal destination given his
2009 aspirations, Happy Val-
ley no longer met his expecta-
tions. So in May of 2010, Burke
switched his commitment to
Michigan.
On Dec. 28, 2010, just days
before 2011 was ushered in, the
Wolverines were set to welcome

Reynolds notches milestone in 'M'win

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
With 18:50 left in the game
against Illinois on Friday, junior
forward Rachel Scheffer drove
and dished the ball to senior
forward
Carmen MICHIGAN 68
Reynolds ILLINOIS 52
for an easy
layup.
While it was an everyday play
for the Wolverines women's bas-
ketball team, it just so happened to
be Reynolds' 1,001st career point.
"I'm so happy for Carmen," said
senior guard Courtney Boylan.
"She's worked her butt off for the
past four years that she's been
here and she's so deserving of get-
ting a 1,000 points. I'm just really
proud of her and how hard she's
worked to get to this point."
Reynolds became the 22nd
Michigan player to record the sta-
tistic. Last season, Veronica Hicks
topped the 1,000-point mark, as
did Carly Benson two seasons ago.
The Wolverines won their Big
Ten opener with a 68-52 victory
over the Fighting Illini at Assem-
bly Hall in Champaign, bringing
the team to 12-2 overall. Though
Illinois is not one of the strongest
teams in the conference, the very
nature of Big Ten play poses chal-
lenges for the Wolverines.
"I think (Big Ten play com-
pared non-conference play) is a
huge difference," Boylan said. "To
me, it's just a lot more physical and
it's a lot more competitive because
you've played these teams every
year and we're a lot more familiar
with one another."
In the first half, Michigan held

the Fighting Illini to just 10 points
on 4-for-19 attempts from the
field, also forcing 13 turnovers in
the first half alone.
But it wasn't only a defensive
effort in the first half. The Wol-
verines shot an impressive 42.4
percent from the field and had just
eight turnovers. Michigan took a
17-point lead and the lion's share
of the momentum into halftime.
"I think in the first half our
defense was really good," said
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth.
"It created some offense opportu-
nities too. I thought the first half
was the best part of that game."
Though Illinois scored 40
points in the second half, it wasn't
enough to come back. The Wol-
verines continued to get to the
basket and score - the final line

was a 45-percent shooting perfor-
mance.
"We were really creating for
each other (on offense)," said
junior forward Rachel Scheffer.
"If we got the ball inside they dou-
bled us, and then we'd pass it out."
Reynolds added: "I think we
did a good job when we got in the
post. We either dished it out to a
shooter or a cutter to the basket.
I think that was pretty critical for
the game."
Reynolds led the way for Mich-
igan, scoring 16 points on 7-for-
11 shooting. She also scored two
3-pointers - putting her just six
away from being the all-time lead-
er in that category. Boylan scored
12 points and junior guard Jenny
Ryan added 12.
Fighting Illini junior Karisma

Penn recorded a double-double,
scoring 22 of her team's 50 points
and pulling down 11 rebounds.
The sturdy, 6-2 forward dominat-
ed in the paint, where she tallied
the majority of her points.
But the Wolverines depth was
evident: Their bench scored 17
points compared to Illinois' three
points. Junior guard Kate Thomp-
son scored seven points and junior
center Sam Arnold added five
points in reserve roles, and the
Fighting Illini were left without
an answer to Michigan's bench.
Though Illinois isn't the biggest
team, it still has significant size
down low - anchored by Penn.
Michigan's ability to outscore and
out-rebound the FightingIllini is a
good sign as the Wolverines move
through their conference slate.

overtime and a flawless Hun-
wick performance to snap the skid.
Saying that Michigan has had a
roller coaster first half would be
like saying Matt Flynn made the
Detroit Lions' defense look only
slightly invisible on Sunday.
But during their stay at Joe
Louis Arena this weekend, it wasn't
just good hockey. It was "Michi-
gan hockey" - the mistake-free,
heads-up brand of play that Beren-
son stresses. Passes, like junior
defenseman Lee Moffie's halfway
through the championship game's
overtime period, sailed right to the
tape of teammate's sticks. In that
instance, sophomore defenseman
Kevin Clare easily tapped in the
game-winning goal.
"Open net," Clare said with a
shrug, like his second career goal
could've scored itself.
And those stupid, untimely pen-
alties that have plagued this team
constantly? Well, the Wolverines
weren't exactly choir boys, espe-
cially against Boston College when
junior forward Chris Brown took
his obligatory trip to the box and
senior defenseman Greg Pateryn
visited twice.
But Friday night in the title game
against Michigan State, they played
with more discipline. And the Spar-
tans,rather, took a devastating pen-
alty that may have cost them the
game. With his team leading 2-1
with justovertwominutes remain-
ing in the game, Michigan State's
Brett Darnell was penalized for
the second time in the third period.
CLARE

helped his team, which Spar-
tan defenseman and first-team all-
tournament member Torey Krug
described as "fast" and "one of the
best transition teams in the nation."
"There's no media timeouts in
overtime," Berenson said. "Itlike the
pace and I like the momentum that
gets going for everyone."
That momentum was hardly on
the Wolverines' side during regula-
tion. Twice, they had to fight back
from two-goal deficits.
After Michigan-State's Tanner
Sorenson ripped a shot from outside
of the circle for the first goal of his
career, the Spartans went into the
second intermission ahead.
But midway through the third
period, Michigan junior forward
Derek DeBlois spotted a rebound
that Palmisano couldn't catch up to.
Just two minutes later, however,
Brett Perlini regained the lead for
Michigan State on a one timer from
the left circle. Trailing 2-1 with two
minutes remaining, the Wolverines,
playing with a sense of urgency,

When asked if the referees should
have swallowed their whistles late
in the game, Spartan coach Tom
Anastos said they got it right.
"It was a penalty," Anastos said.
And it was one that allowed the
Wolverines to equalize and to win.
Shots found twine despite hot
goalies and the clock winding
down. And Hunwick made sure
they didn't at the other end.
So which Michigan team can
we expect to see for the last seven
weekends of the regular season?
The downtrodden bunch that
makes the 2011 tournament run
feel like a distant memory? Or the
upstart, opportunistic squad that
hung a banner at Joe Louis this
weekend?
The next three weekends will
dictate the answer. A surprisingly
hot Lake Superior State team comes
to YostIce Arena Friday and Satur-
day. Next weekend, it's a chance
for revenge against CCHA-leading
Ohio State. The Buckeyes swept
Michigan at Yost in November.
The series finale will be outdoors,
where the Wolverines dominated
last season, this time at Cleveland's
Progressive Field. Then it's peren-
nial power Notre Dame. If Michi-
gan had taken care of business in
the first half, it could afford itself
some series splits. But senior cap-
tain Luke Glendening said before
the holiday break that they can't be
satisfied with winning one of two.
Playing "Michigan hockey" can
make that a reality.

needing a spark. The Spartans took
an untimely penalty for tripping,
meaning Michigan would essential-
lyclose the game on the power play.
After a constantbarrage of shots
foraboutaminute,theequalizerstill
eluded the Wolverines. So Berenson
elected to pull Hunwick and give
his team a two-man advantage. All
Michigan power play woes aside,
this one wasdestined to succeed.
Junior forward Kevin Lynch was
standing at point-blank range when
he found twine after a pass from
sophomore forward Luke Moffatt
and sent the game into overtime.
The win won't show up in the
CCHA standings, as it was a non-
league affair. But Berenson hinted
before the tournament that he has
seen the GLI dictate his team's sec-
ond-half performance far too often
- for better or worse.

the Wolverines see it as a spring-
board.
"I think we're making strides
in the right direction," Treais said.
"Winning two games here is huge

BURKE
From Page 1B
the Wolverines' second confer-
ence win.
"(The last possession) wasn't
designed for me," Williams said. "I
just happened to be open and it felt
good, but it just didn't go down."
Michigan (2-0,12-2) came out of
the gates sloppily, committing four
turnovers in the first four minutes
of the gdmsnt sesmmunicationissues
and errant passes put Michigan in
an early 6-1 hole, but the Wolver-
ines regrouped.
"Last year we might have not
bounced back from the first four
minutes," said senior guard Stu
Douglass. "Putthose firstfourmin-
utes and four turnovers and missed
free throws, missed shots ... kind of
put it behind us and went forward
and just stayed together. Last year
I don't think we really would have
done that."
Both teams struggled to score in

the opening frame, with the Golden
Gophers making30 percentoftheir
shots while the Wolverines shot
just 28 percent
But the Wolverines went on an
18-5 run to take an eight-point lead
before Minnesota closed the gap
in the final minutes of the opening
frame. Michigan went into the half
leading 23-19.
Burke was 4-for-6 in the half.
He drained a 3-pointer and sank
two closer jump shots on the move,
sparking Michigan's run.
The freshman finished the half
with 11 points - no other Wolver-
ine had more than three points.
Burke was the only Michigan scor-
er to finish in double figures for the
game.
In the second half, Burke's
attacks came closer to the basket.
He challenged Minnesota guard
Maverick Ahanmisi on the screen-
.and-roll and was able to convert on
layups and drawfouls.
"They tried to play the perimeter

and they really didn't letus get a lot
of open threes," Burke said. "We
kept taking what they gave us. Like
(assistant) coach (LaVall Jordan)
said, 'Don't make a mistake, let the
defense make a mistake for you and
just go off of what they give you."'
Burke finished with 8-for-
11 shooting, making both of his
3-point attempts and converting on
nine of 11 free throws.
He shouldered the scoring load,
as the Wolverines with the hot
hands the last few games strug-
gled to find the basket.Sophomore
forward Tim Hardaway Jr., who
scored 26 points on Thursday
against Penn State, had just seven
on Sunday.
And sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz, coming off three straight
double-doubles, kept up his strong
rebounding, but made little impact
in the scoring column. He finished
with two points and nine rebounds.
"You always want to take the big
scorers out," Williams said. "But

once we do that, then we got to still
contain the other guys and that's
something we didn't do today."
The Golden Gophers briefly tied
Michigan in the second half, and
the Wolverines kept a comfortable
cushion until the final minutes.
But two straight 3-pointers from
guard Julian Welch brought Min-
nesota to within one point with just
under two minutes remaining. And
after a miss from Novak, the Gold-
en Gophers had a chance to take the
lead, but air-balled as the shotclock
ran down.
A jump shot from Hardaway Jr.
gave Michigan a 3-point lead and
they wouldn't give it away.
Minnesota couldn't convert on
its final chance to tie the game.
Michigan defied the Mayans and
avoided a collapse on its first game
of the new year.
"It was definitely a Big Ten bat-
tle," said Morgan. "Big shots didn't
fall for us necessarily, but we still
gutted this one out."

In Rewind: A look back at Michigan athletics in 2011

By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
NEW ORLEANS - It was
November 26, the date Jim Tres-
sel emphasized when he was dis-
missed at Ohio State five months
earlier.
"Don't forget: on November
26th we're going to kick (Michi-
gan's) ass!" the embattled Tressel
told a roaring crowd outside his
home in mid-June.
He was wrong.
As the errant fourth-down
pass hovered a few feet above the
ground, Courtney Avery dove over
a downed receiver and snatched
the ball out of the air. Fans flooded
over the brick retaining wall and
onto the Michigan Stadium turf.
Brady Hoke and Greg Mattison
embraced.
40-34.
For the first time in eight tries,
Michigan had beaten Ohio State.
Roy Roundtree spied Mike
Martin standing by the tun-
nel. The lanky receiver pushed
through the droves of students
separating the two players and
stopped a few feet short.
"Mike," Roundtree yelled,
spreading his arms wide. "Mike.
We finally did it, brother."
Martin pulled out of a photo-
graph pose with a student to greet
Roundtree.
"We did it," he screamed back.
Martin - all 6-foot-2, 304
pounds of him - grabbed the out-
side of Roundtree's shoulder pads
and lifted him straight into the
air. Roundtree saluted the crowd
behind the tunnel.
At long last, Roundtree and the
Wolverineswere really, truly, back
on top.
It was the culmination of four
years on campus forthe duo. What
began as three years of misery
ended in magical fashion - a vic-
tory over the Buckeyes, a 10-2
record and a BCS bowl berth.
It was also the lasting highlight
in a memorable 2011 for Michigan
athletics. But it wasn't the only
one. Here are some more memo-
ries, in reverse chronological
order:
DECEMBER 30 - DETROIT
Little-used sophomore defen-

seman Kevin Clare couldn't have
found a better time to score his
second career goal. Clare's goal
midway through overtime gave
the Michigan hockey team a 3-2
victory over Michigan State and
the Great Lakes Invitational title
for the second consecutive season.
DECEMBER3 - PALO ALTO,
CALIF.
In a season defined by valleys
and peaks, the Michigan volley-
ball team hit its high at just the
right time. The same team that
was ranked No. 18 at the open-
ing of conference play - yet went
on to lose eight of its next 10 Big
Ten games - displayed a familiar
dominance in a four-set upset of
No. 6 Stanford to advance into the
Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tour-
nament.
NOVEMBER 19 - ANN ARBOR
The Nebraska football team vis-
ited Michigan Stadium for the first
time since 1962 and left husked,
shucked and defeated. Michigan
welcomed the 17th-ranked Corn-
huskers to the Big Ten with a
45-17 drubbing. The win marked
a reemergence of classic Michigan
football and set the Wolverines up
for The Game the following Satur-
day.
NOVEMBER3 - WOLFE-
BORO, N.H.
One of the biggest highlights
for the Michigan basketball team
had nothing to do with anyone
on the roster. This was the date
that Mitch McGary, a high school
senior at Brewster Academy and
a consensus No. 2 prospect in the
nation, bypassed perennial pow-
ers Duke and Florida to commit
to coach John Beilein and the
Wolverines. The true effect of
McGary's decision won't be felt
for another season, but it certainly
sent ripples down the traditional
hierarchy ofcollege basketball.
SEPTEMBER 10 - ANN
ARBOR
Nobody left their seat early
at the Michigan football team's
Under the Lights matchup with

Notre Dame - the firstnightgame
in Michigan Stadium's storied his-
tory. Viewed by 114,804 pairs of
eyes, junior quarterback Denard
Robinson and the offense drove
80 yards in 28 seconds, capped
by a 16-yard touchdown pass to
Roundtree in the corner of the end
zone, to defeat the Fighting Irish,
35-31.
May 30 - Columbus
Tressel is dismissed by Ohio
State. If you think this doesn't
belong in Michigan's year in
review, you're wrong. Nov. 26
may not have happened the way it
did without May 30. After 10 sea-
sons, six conference titles and a
9-1 record against the Wolverines
at the helm in Columbus, Tres-
sel was replaced by intirim coach
Luke Fickell amid a memorabilia-
selling scandal and cover up. A
week later, star quarterback Ter-
relle Pryor left the Buckeyes.
MAY 25 - ANN ARBOR
In what Athletic Director Dave
Brandon called "the worst-kept
secret in America," the club men's
and women's lacrosse teams were
promoted to varsity status. Michi-
gan is the first FBS school to add
men's lacrosse since Notre Dame
did it in 1981. The nation's fastest-
growing sport has a new hub in
Ann Arbor, and it's here to stay.
APRIL 15 - COLUMBUS/,
CLEVELAND
In one' night, the Michigan
men's and women's gymnastics
teams made history - twice.
Senior Kylee Botterman won
the NCAA all-around title at the
NCAA Semifinals in Cleveland,
becoming the latest Wolverine
gymnast to win the national title
since Elise Ray won a split title
in 2001. Botterman later won the
AAI Award as the nation's best
gymnast. A few hours away in
Columbus, freshman Sam Miku-
lak captured the all-around title
at the NCAA Championships for
the men's team, becoming the first
freshman to ever win the NCAA
title. With the duo winning the
NCAA all-around titles, Michigan
became the firstschool ever to win


Michigan fans stormed the field at Michigan Stadium after the Wolverines' first victory over Ohio St

both the men's and women's titles
in the same season.
APRIL 9 - ST. PAUL, MINN.
In a span of two days, the Mich-
igan hockeyteam felt the extremes
of elation and devastation in the
NCAA Frozen Four at Xcel Energy
Center. First came the toppling of
No. 1 North Dakota in the semifi-
nal, a 2-0 shutout for senior goalie
Shawn Hunwick and the Wolver-
ines. Hunwick made 40 saves to
catapult Michigan into the NCAA
title game. It was the Wolverines'
first appearance in the NCAA final
since Michigan coach Red Beren-
son's team won the program's
ninth championship in 1998. But
then the agony of defeat hit. The
Wolverines took No. 3 Minneso-
ta-Duluth into overtime in the
finale before Bulldogforward Kyle
Schmidt took a feed in front of the
net and flipped the puck past Hun-
wick for the 3-2 win.
APRIL 4 - AUGUSTA, GA.
At the ripe age of 22 years old,
Michigan golfer Lion Kim found
himself paired with PGA veterans
Jose Maria Olazabal and Davis
Love III at the 2011 Masters. Kim
became the first Michigan student
to earn a Masters bid. On his third
stroke of the tournament, Kim
secured his first career birdie at
the Masters after sticking a seven
iron to eight feet and draining the
putt. Kim missed the cut by just
three strokes after shooting a 148
(+4) over two rounds, tying for
64th overall.

MARCH 20 - CHARLOTTE,
N.C.
Darius Morris's last shot in a
Michigan uniform won't soon be
forgotten. After a 75-45 beat down
of Tennessee in the NCAA Tour-
nament round of 64, the Wolver-
ines trailed No. 3 Duke, 73-71, in
the round of 32. With three sec-
onds remaining, Morris elevated
to sent up a floater from just inside
the free-throw line. The ball lofted
over the outstretched arms of Blue
Devil forward Ryan Kelly, hung
above the hoop and finally clanged
off the back of the rim. The senior-
less team was mere inches away
from doing the unthinkable. Two
months later, Morris announced
his decision to forgo his junior and
senior seasons to enter the NBA
draft.
MARCH 19 - PHILADELPHIA
Michigan redshirt junior wres-
tler Kellen Russell captured the
first national title of the year for
Michigan by posting a 5-0 record
at the NCAA Championships.
Russell fought off an ankle inju-
ry to defeat third-ranked Boris
Novachokov (Cal Poly) in the final
of the 141-pound weight class. He
finished the season with the best
individual season record in Michi-
gan wrestling history, a perfect
38-0. Russell was later named
Michigan Athlete of the Year with
Mikulak and Botterman.
MARCH 5-- ANN ARBOR
If The Game was the top regu-

lar-season highl4:ht in 2011, sec-
ond place would have to go to the
Michigan basketball team's sweep
of Michigan State - the first
sweep since the 1996-97 season.
Freshman guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. exploded for 20 second-half
points in the season finale against
the Spartans at Crisler Arena,
leading Michiganto a 70-63 win.
JANUARY 11- ANN ARBOR
You can't have the end of the
year without the beginning. On
this date, Brandon announced
the hiring of Hoke, a relatively
unknown head coach from San
Diego State, to replace outgoing
head coach Rich Rodriguez. Hoke
had just a 47-50 record in stints
at Ball State and San Diego State,
but he represented a return to the
Michigan football of old.
He worked under Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr in the 1990s. It took no
time for Hoke to endear himself to
a Wolverine nation thirsting for a
new face for the program.
His opening press conference
set his plan in stone: Win with
the current team, win the Big Ten
Championship and beat "Ohio."
And when asked if the Michigan
coaching job is as prestigious as
it once was, Hoke coined a phrase
now immortalized within the pro-
gram:
"This is Michigan, fergod-
sakes."
On Tuesday, Jan. 3 - 357 days
since his hiring - Hoke led Michi-
gan into its first BCS bowl victory
since 2000.
But that's for another year.

Hockey report card: First-half grades

OFFENSE

EVERETT COOK// DAILY SPORTS EDITOR
DEFENSE SPECIAL TEAMS GOALIES INTANGIBLES COACHING *
-~ I.n

Before the season, concerns
about youth and inexperience
surrounded the offense of the
Michigan hockey team. Coach Red
Berenson said that he didn't know
which of his freshmen were going
to step up, statingthat it might take
a while for the teamto figure it out.
He was right about that, but for
different reasons than expected.
The veterans, rather than the
freshmen, have been the inconsis-
tent players. Freshman Alex Gup-
till leads the team in goals with
nine, and fellow freshman Phil Di
Giuseppe is right behind him with
eight. Guptill has seemingly come
out of nowhere after his last two
seasons in junior hockey ended
with injuries.
David Wohlberg has been one
of the most confounding veterans.
The senior captain has picked up
his offensive production recently,
but he started the season with just
three goals in the Wolverines' first
15 games . His play in the second
half will have a massive impact on
theoffense'sefficiency.
Michigan (5-6-3 CCHA, 9-8-3
overall) leads the CCHA in scor-
ing offense with 78 goals, but that
number would be alot lower with-
out some early-season blowouts.
Thanks to the line of Chris Brown,
Guptill and Wohlberg, the offense
has been solid and has given the
Wolverines a chance in most games.
Still, Michigan continues to look for
offensive consistencyin2012.
GRADE: B

Everything changed with the
suspension of sophomore Jon
Merrill. Last season's fresh-
man sensation hasn't played a
game this season, challenging
the depth of a group that hasn't
played up to expectations yet.
The defense is seventh in the
CCHA, allowing 2.59 goals a
game, but that doesn't tell the
whole story. While the offense
might be inconsistent, the
defense has been downright
unreliable. During the Wolver-
ines' seven-game winless streak
- they didn't win a game in
November - the defense became
as unpredictable as a dinner in
MoJo. On Nov. 18 against Ohio
State, the defense gave Michigan
a chance to win by allowing just
two goals. The next night, the
Wolverines allowed six. There
are nights when the defense
looks impenetrable, but then
there are nights when every-
thing turns sour after one goal.
The top pairing of senior Greg
Pateryn and sophomore Mac
Bennett has been the bright spot
for this defensive corps. The
duo uses different approaches to
complement each other, as Ben-
nett attacks the offensive zone
while Pateryn stays back and
shoots from the point.
The predicted return of Mer-
rill should do wonders for the
defense - one of Michigan's cur-
rent weak links.
GRADE:C

Berenson has tinkered with
his penalty kill and power play
units from day one but still
hasn't found a successful com-
bination. With an inexperi-
enced special teams corps, he'll
continue to tinker for the rest of
the season - and for good rea-
son.
The power play hasn't been
bad, but it also hasn't been very
good. Michigan is convert-
ing a little over 16 percent of
its power plays, which is good
for seventh in the CCHA. Not
horrible, but nothing to tweet
about. Experience is the name
of the game for the power play,
so look for a bump in production
in the second half of the season.
The penalty kill is a differ-
ent story - Michigan is dead
last in the CCHA in penalty kill
percentage at 80 percent. The
frustrating part for Michigan
is when those man-down goals
are coming. Often, the penalty-
kill unit will hold strong for the
first 90 seconds, then give up
a goal with 30 seconds or less
left on the penalty. The depth is
simply not there.
A reduction of needless pen-
alties will certainly improve
the penalty kill - Brown might
as well get his mail delivered to
the box - and Merrill will be a
big contributor, but as of right
now, the unit needs to improve.
GRADE: C-

Let's be honest - this section
should read "Goalie." Backup
sophomore netminder Adam
Janecyk has played significant
minutes only once this sea-
son, and that was just because
starter Shawn Hunwick went
all Manny Pacquiao on a North-
ern Michigan player and got
ejected.
Though Hunwick hasn't been
perfect, he continues to make
Berenson look like the smartest
recruiter in the land.
The former walk-on is the
sole starter for the first time in
his career, and so far he is the
indisputable MVP of the Wol-
verines. His .917 save percent-
age is sixth in the CCHA, but
that number is skewed consid-
ering the erratic defense that
plays in front of him.
He went through a rough
patch when the defense was
struggling, but Berenson
declared him "back" after the
series in Alaska.
Nobody Michigan has played
this season has had a goalie left
out to dry as much as Hunwick,
who makes one-on-one plays
look easy, night in and night
out. He will rank up there with
the best goalies in Michigan
history when his career ends in
a couple months.
Just hope Hunwick doesn't
get hurt.
GRADE: A-

During that November los-
ing streak, not a single Wolver-
ine had an answer as to why the
team was in such a funk. A whole
lot of"I don't know" and "we just
have to keep working" answers
were doled out, skirting over the
underlying, potentially very seri-
ous issue.
This is a team that looked
lethargic, lazy and even disinter-
ested for most of November. One
negative play, and things would
just snowball. This young team
didn't have the mental fortitude
and "want-to" to keep any sort
of momentum together, an issue
that is a lot harder to fix than
defense or special teams.
But over the last month, they
seemingly fixed the problem.
Michigan looks more confident
and poised on the ice, getting
to the promised land of match-
ing its physical abilities with its
mental fortitude. Maybe it was
more experience, or perhaps it
was the Wolverines finally buy-
ing into Berenson's specific style
of hockey.
Whatever the reason, the
team from a month ago would
not have gotten anywhere close
to winning the Great Lakes Invi-
tational, as it did last week. For a
young team, confidence is every-
thing, and the Wolverines are
seemingly growing up before our
very eyes.
GRADE: B-

Berenson had one ofhis top two
defensemen suspended before the
year. He has had to manage an
inexperienced roster that consists
of almost one-third freshmen.
And he dealt with losing his top
assistant coach for 23 years, Mel
Pearson, to Michigan Tech after
last season.
Yet Michigan is right in the
thick of things. It is eighth in the
CCHA - but is just eight points
outofsecond place- andwould be
in the hunt for the NCAA Tourna-
mentfor the22rd consecutive year
if the season endedtoday.Amid all
the expectations that come with
Michigan hockey, the old coach
has mostly kept the ship righted.
It has rocked a little - actually, a
lot - but there have been no cast-
aways yet. The schedule in 2012
is much tougher than 2011, but if
there is anyone who knows how to
handle it, it's Berenson.
The most impressive part of
Berenson's work this season has
been how he has dealt with the
Merrill situation, Some coaches
would have brought back a star
player as soon as possible to try
and halt a month-long losing
streak, but Berenson stuck to his
guns. He will bring Merrill back
when his pupil has improved not
as a hockey player, but as a person.
Some things are bigger than hock-
ey, and Berenson has a pretty good
grasp on that.

Spotted: Tweed Jackets
During the gray-flannel
days of the 1950s, professo-
rial garb called for a closet
full of wools, tweeds, dark
suits and bowties. While the
wool overcoat and gray flan-
nel pant will always stand as
the paragon of traditionalism,
this winter season is popu-
lated with the wonderful play
of patterns, from a pair of
blackwatch trousers to a tribal
print jacket, all culminating
in the polomatic man. But in
the end, it doesn't matter how
you wear it, for the goal is the
same: Keep warm - even if
v. that means hiding underneath
a blanket.

THE JUNK DRAWER

Wednesday, January 4, 2012 // The Statement

With letters of recommendation,
an old tradition persists

letter from the editors

by dylan cinti and jennifer xu
Stashu Kybartas is a senior
lecturer in the University's
Department of Screen Arts and
Cultures. He usually teaches
three classes a term and performs
a number of other administrative
duties. He teaches so much that
he hasn't had time to pursue his
own creative work. Kybartas has
been at the University for 11years
- but under current University
policy, he'll never be eligible for
tenure.
Why is that?
In this issue you'll read an
article addressing this and
other questions surrounding the
complex and divisive issue of
tenure at the University. It's an
article that operates on both a
micro and macro level, pairing
very personal stories with broad
data about the spectrum of tenure
attainment at the University.
While it may not provide
definitive answers, the article
will undoubtedly prompt some
compelling questions.
With investigative journalism,
you have to look at the big picture
in order to understand the small
one, and vice versa. An article
just about numbers lacks a
human element, while an article
comprised only of people's stories
lacks a factual basis. Successful
investigative journalism lies in
the merging of these two factors
and in the creation of something
illuminating and accessible.
As its name suggests, The
Statement is geared toward the
kind of hard-hitting coverage
that will get people thinking
and talking. For us, this means
coverage that's backed up by

evidence and interesting stories.
So at the same time you read
Kybartas's story, you'll discover
that half of the Screen Arts and
Cultures Department's faculty
are lecturers like him, whereas
only 16 percent for the entire
College of Literature, Science and
the Arts faculty is comprised of
lecturers.
But we live in a digital age, and
so for us, investigative journalism
extends beyond reporting and
number-crunching and into the
vast and ever-expanding realm of
social media.
Starting this semester we're
introducing The Tangent, a blog
that will supplement our main
stories with videos and behind-
the-scenes peeks into how articles
came to fruition. Additionally,
we're introducing polling on
our stories, so that you can voice
feedback to articles with the click
of a button. We also have a Twitter,
so that discussions that start here
can continue online. It will all
come full circle when we compile
reader comments, poll feedback
and tweets and publish them on
these pages.
We're looking to you to help us
make a statement.

What are you currently reading?
"Three and Out," John U. Bacon's behind-the-scenes
book on the RichRod era. It's a fascinating look at
how this University really works.
Do you have any guilty pleasures?
I secretly like any movie with Rachel McAdams in

by Jacob Axelrad

John Rubadeau writes more
than 100 letters of recommenda-
tion each year. The senior lec-
turer in the English Department
says he writes such a high number
because of the close relationships
he builds with students, allowing
him to write letters that reflect
students' personalities instead
of canned assessments of candi-
dates.
But at a university with more
than 20,000 undergraduates,
finding that ideal reference letter
that says something genuine can
be difficult.
Chemistry Lecturer Kathleen
Nolta acknowledged this diffi-
culty, admitting she doesn't know
all of the students who request
recommendation letters from
her. Still, she said she sympa-
thizes with these students, many
of whom will apply to medical
school after leaving her class.
"I will not refuse to write for
any student because some of
them are only in large classes,
so for those students, it's almost
impossible to get to know their
professors," she said.
If just obtaining a reference
letter is hard, then it is even more
difficult for a student to receive a
recommendation that sets him or
her apart from the crowd. Such
obstacles beg the question as to
whether the system of reference

letters is still effective to our gen-
eration.
The lowdown on getting a
letter
Obtaining a letter begins
with the Reference Letter Ser-
vice at the University's Career
Center. Every year, about 6,000
new letters are processed and
10,000 student files are sent to
employers and graduate schools,
according to the Career Center's
website.
A student opens a file with the
RLS for a fee of $25. In turn, rec-
ommenders submit one copy of
the student's letter to the RLS,
which is maintained for five
years after the file is first opened.
As long as students have a file,
they can request that their letters
be sent to any employer or gradu-
ate school of their choice.
Upon requesting a letter, stu-
dents can choose to waive their
right to view the letter, giving the
writer greater reign to say what
he or she really thinks about an
applicant. Yet Linguistics Prof.
Robin Queen said in recent years,
letters of recommendation have
been demonstrated to be artifi-
cially enthusiastic, presenting all
applicants as though they were at
the top of their class.
"It's not the case that letters

of recommendation really tell
you, 'Here's the top two percent
of candidates. Here's the top five
percent. Here's the top 10 per-
cent,' " she said. "They all tend
to be, 'Everyone's in the top one
percent.' "
That can make it hard to dis-
tinguish between candidates.
Queen said the competitive
nature of graduate school admis-
sions creates a system in which
anything less than the top cat-
egory looks bad, a mentality that
follows the increasing trend of
inflation among undergraduate
grades.
"A C is actually an average
grade," Queen said. "But stu-
dents see a C as basically failing.
So that same shift has happened
in recommendation letters."
Queen also said studies done
by Profs. Frances Trix and
Carolyn Psenka of Wayne State
University have shown that
both letter writers and letter
readers may have unintentional
cognitive biases, which could
lead to negative repercussions
for one applicant group over
another.
The paper, "Exploring the
Color of Glass: Letters of Recom-
mendation for Female and Male
Medical Faculty," studied people
applying for academic positions
in medical schools. Recommend-

ers talked about men's research
abilities and women's teaching
and nurturing abilities, indicating
an unintentional gender bias. This
goes for ethnicity as well as gen-
der, Queen said.
Those evaluating and reading
letters and resumes may also har-
bor an unintentional bias.
She gave the example a differ-
ent study done by professors at
the Massachusetts Institute for
Technology and the University
of Chicago Graduate school of
Business in which identical fake
resumes were sent to employers,
with the difference that one set
had male names and the other had
female names. The study showed
that those with male names were
more likely to be hired.
This same study was replicated
with ethnically marked names
and stereotypically white names.
The ethnically marked names got
fewer callbacks than their generi-
cally white counterparts.
"The basic story there is that
this is not an intentional bias
exactly, but there is a kind of
cultural bias around this kind of
thing," Queen said.
Are letters even relevant
anymore?
Many graduate and profes-
sional schools require two to
five letters with a combination
of academic and non-academic
sources.
According to English Lec-
turer Cody Walker, a former
graduate . admissions officer,
"hyperbole is the order of the
day" when it comes to letters,
so admissions committees must
determine whether the recom-
mender worked from a template
or if something special about the
student caught the professor's
eye.
Recommendation letters also
don't enjoy the cachet they once
did..
RLS supervisor Mariella
Mecozzi explained that while
letters are still important for
graduate and professional school
applications and jobs in aca-
demia, they are not as important
when it comes to other jobs.
"Jobs can be very specific by
nature," she said.
She pointed out that a phone
reference allows the employer to
get the specific feedback they're
looking for.
"Your typical undergraduate
student ... would be better advised
to have three to five people that
agree to speak on their behalf,"
Mecozzi said.

The benefits of an old-
fashioned letter
For students, contacting teach-
ers who may not even remembeF
your face is uncomfortable and
ineffective. And as a teacher, it
may seem like a thankless task of
writing letter after letter for stu-
dents you could barely know.
But for many at the University,
letters do actually make a difP
ference in the grand scheme of
things.
Though Nolta admits the pro-
cess can be cumbersome, she said
it's an essential component of a stu-
dent's time as an undergraduate.
"Is it an obstacle? Yes. Is it a
good growth experience? Abso-
lutely," she said, adding that it
encourages interaction among
teachers and students.
LSA senior Alex Myong agrees.
Applying to medical schools-
Myong said he was forced to
reach outside his comfort zone
and make connections with pro-
fessors he could have otherwise
overlooked.
"It kind of forces you to find
professors who fill requirements
instead of the professors you're
closest with," Myong said.
For Rubadeau, letters are vital.
"That's the joy of life, to get to
know people and become friends
with people," Rubadeau said. "If
I have a chance to help someone
out in his or her career, then I'll
help him or her out. And I enjoy
that."
Walker bemoaned the process
but added that he finds satisfac-
tion in writing letters.
While a simple phone call
could be quicker and easier, the
act of writing - of actually sit-
ting down with a student in mind
and crafting a letter on his or her
behalf - is a bonding experience
for both the student and the prow
fessor, Walker said.
"Being about to do it, I hate,"
Walker said. "Having it in my cal-
endar feels oppressive in the way
that sitting down to write a Ph.D.
dissertation felt oppressive. But
actually doing it is usually kind of
interesting and having done it is
great."
There's a pay-it-forward men-
tality among professors across
departments, Walker said.
After all, none of them would
be where they are today if it
weren't for professors writing
them letters.
So the tradition persists.
"I think there's some sense of
ethical or karmic obligation to
keep it going as long as it's still the,
system," Walker said.

Lecturers:
Off the beaten track
In April 2010, University lectur-
-ers erupted in protest after Kirsten
Herold, then vice president of the
Lecturers'Employee Organization,
was not reappointed to her position
as a lecturer in the Department of
English Language and Literature
a post she'd heldfornS years.
'i Herold has since been hired as
a lecturer in the School of Public
Health, but she said being a lectur-
er can be shaky territory.
"The department can just say,
'Sorry, it's not working out,' and let
you go," Herold said.
Lecturers, who comprise 16 per-
cent offaculty in LSA, are not hired
on the tenure track. Instead they
have fixed-length contracts that
can be renewed or not.
According to Herold, most lec-
turers have Ph.D.s and are experts
in theirfield. But there's a hugegulf
between lecturers and professors in
terms ofjob security, responsibili-
ties and salary.
The typical baseline salary for
lecturers is $33,000, which is less
than Ann Arbor Public School
teachers, who generally make
$60,000 to $70,000, according to
Herold.
Por that reason, Herold said it's
in the financial interest of the Uni-
versity to hire lecturers as opposed
Mo tenured professors.
According to Herold, there's'
about a 25 percent annual turn-
over among lecturers. She said
many people leave because a part-
ner or spouse needs to move, while
others realize the career is a "dead
end."

thriving academically.
She added that most people who pursue careers in
academia aren't satisfied with just a paycheck.
"So much satisfaction from your job comes from
these intangibles like the rewards you get for publish-
ingand the rewards you get for teaching," Poe said.
It's these kinds of rewards, Poe said, that impel
faculty down the tenure track.
"If all they wranted was money, they would do
something else that makes more money," Poe said.
Still, for the professors who've developed into
"dead wood" - or stopped publishing or conduct-
ing research - Poe said a process exists wherein the
department chair will ask the professor to teach
more classes to make up for the dearth of research
publications.
Poe said Medical School faculty are particu-
larly motivated to continue research, because their
research is dependent on grants. Thus, if a profes-
sor in the Medical School decides to slack off on
research, he or she would be left without a source of
funding, and consequently, without a lab.
"If I'm not doing science, then my lab would be
taken away," Poe said. "Everybody working for me -
if I'm not supportingthem on my grants - goes away.
I'm just left with an office."
ARE LONGER PROBATIONARY PERIODS
HELPFUL OR FRUSTRATING?
Though an assistant professor typically has eight
years to make tenure, the regents voted to extend
that period to 10 years last April.
But the decision to actually implement that exten-
sion was left up to each school and college. So far, none
have extended their probationary period to 10 years.
In an e-mail sent to faculty before the change was
passed, University Provost Philip Hanlon wrote the
reasons for the extensions were centered around
giving extra time for Medical School faculty to get
their research up and running, as well as providing
more flexibility to faculty in two-career and single-
parent households.
The change has been both supported and con-
tested.

Whitman agreed that the extension would be
beneficial for certain disciplines, but other faculty
members are skeptical of the motivations behind the
change and fear there could be unintended negative
consequences.
Poe said though the Medical School was the driv-
ing force behind the extension, the other schools
and colleges likely won't adopt the change because
the longer the probationary period, the longer some-
one "stews in hot water" and the longer "the agony of
trying to prove yourself to your peers."
Poe said one of the main concerns about the two-
year extension is that the expectations for tenure
track faculty would become greater because they
would have more time in the probationary period.
While a researcher might typically be expected
to publish 25 papers in seven years, Poe said that if
researchers now had nine years to obtain tenure, the
expectation would increase to about 35 papers.
"It's just prolonging the agony," Poe said.
Poe added that extending the probationary period
could be a potential problem for recruiting faculty.
"When the University of Michigan is competing
for faculty with other universities that have shorter
tenure clocks, those other universities will win if
ours is too long," Poe said. "In order to remain com-
petitive with our peer institutions, we need to have
similar clock lengths."
STAYING ON TRACK
Obtaining a Ph.D. seems to be only the first step
toward securing the independence associated with a
full professor position. Prospective tenure-track fac-
ulty must battle through probationary periods, form
reviews, evaluations and clock extensions in order to
earn their place among the leaders and best.
According to Jeffery Frumkin, associate vice
provost for academic and faculty affairs and senior
director of academic human resources, this is
because tenured faculty are hired in ordertto advance
the University's academic mission, both in research
and in teaching.
"It is the tenured faculty that really set the stan-
dards of what excellence means at the University,"
Frumkin said.

School were able to prevent him
from obtaining tenure.
In the Law School, a two-thirds
majority faculty vote is required to
put someone up for tenure. In Ham-
mer's case, faculty voted 18-12 in
favor - two votes shy of the requi-
site number of2o.
According to Hammer, in depo-
sitions under oath, faculty mem-
bers who'd voted against him
obscured their views on issues
like homosexuality.
In August 2010, the Michigan
Court of Claims tossed out Ham-
mer's claim of sexual orientation
discrimination, according to a
Sept. 15, 2011 litigation report to
the Regents.
Last July, the court also dis-
missed Hammer's claim that the
University failed to provide him
adequate notice of his non-reap-
pointment, according to the liti-
gation report.
Since 2003 Hammer has taught;
at Wayne State University, where
he's a tenured law professor.
But Hammer said he won't
abandon his case against the Law
School and is currently in the pro-
cess appealing both decisions.
"Institutions need to be held
accountable when they violate
your rights,".Hammer said.
Inan e-mail interview, University
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald wrote
that the University didn't commit
any violations, an assertion he said is
proven by the court's rulings.
"The University does not
believe it violated Prof Ham-
mer's rights," Fitzgerald wrote.
"More importantly, neither did
the courts."

Wednesday, January 4, 2012 // The Statement

Stashu Kybartas:
Why can't films get you
tenure?

Peter Hammer:
Prejudice on the
track?

The University's Board of Regents approved
a revision to its bylaws last April, which allows
schools and colleges to extend the upper limit
of their tenure probationary periods to lOyears.
The regents left the decision up to schools as
to whether they wanted to change their clock
periods, and as of now, none of them have cho-
sen to implement the extension.
Christina Whitman, the University's vice
provost for academic and faculty affairs, said
someone rarely goes through the whole five to
seven year process without obtaining tenure.
"It doesn't mean that every assistant profes-
sor gets tenure by any means," Whitman said.
"But we get very few people who go all the way
through the process and don't get tenure at the
end."
A HIERARCHY OF EVALUATIONS
LSA departments: the

Running the tenure track
By Mary Hannahan

Who is the Lamberto Cesari Collegiate Professor of
Mathematics? What sets him apart from a recently hired
assistant professor in the Department of Germanic Lan-
guages and Literature?
While such distinctions may seem meaningless to
University students, they denote a complex process of
faculty standing at the University.
Tenure is a concept most often associated with aca-
demia, allowing a professor a lifelong appointment
within the University and a guaranteed salary in many
schools and colleges.
According to Mathematics Prof. Daniel Burns, presi-
dent of the University's chapter of the American Associa-
tion of University Professors, tenure is about being able
to hold unpopular or controversial views without the fear
of losing your job.
During the McCarthy era in the 1950s, professors
around the country were fired for the views they held,
both public and private. According to Gina Poe, an asso-
ciate professor in the Medical School, tenure is meant to
prevent similar events from happening.
"Tenure is a wonderful thing," Poe said. "In an aca-
demic environment, we need to be free to express our
opinions."
A former Vice Chair of the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs, the leading faculty governing
body, Poe is familiar with the University's tenure pro-
cess. SACUA has the power to recommend dismissal of a
faculty member to the Board of Regents.
Poe said it's incredibly difficult to fire a tenured pro-
fessor. Only grave breaches of ethical conduct, like sexu-
al harassment or stealing money from the University, are
offenses warranting dismissal.
But the process of actually landing tenure is no walk
in the park either.
STARTING THE RACE
The tenure process consists of three stages: assistant
professorship, associate professorship and full professor-
ship. A professor only becomes tenured when he or she
gets promoted to associate professor.
Faculty start the tenure track as an assistant professor,

a position that almost always requires a Ph.D.
According to information compiled by The Michigan
Daily, assistant professors currently constitute 19 per-
cent of faculty in LSA.
Many individuals teach classes for the first time after
they become assistant professors, though many others
have had prior experience working as graduate student
instructors.
During the tenure probationary period, a time when
faculty have not yet obtained permanent employment,
assistant professors teach, research and complete other
administrative duties - all the while proving they're
qualified to obtain tenure. Poe calls the tenure probation-
ary period a time of uncertainty when tenure hopefuls
"stew in hot water."
Tenure expectations differ between schools, colleges
and even departments.
Poe said an assistant professor in the Medical School,
for example, would be expected to teach classes, start a
research lab, obtain at least one major grant from a fed-
eral research institute to fund the research and publish
articles in accredited journals. An assistant professor in
the LSA English department might be expected to teach
one to two classes, conduct research, publish articles and
write a book.
Assistant professors start with a three-year contract.
At the end of the third year, they undergo a review to
assess if the work they've done is up to departmental
standards.
"It sort of gives them three years to fish or cut bait,"
Poe said. "If they're totally failing after three years, they
get a poor third year review, and they see the writing on
the wall."
What happens then?
"Their contract is not renewed, and they're out."
But Poe said most assistant professors at the Univer-
sity pass the review and have their contracts renewed.
Each school in the University currently sets its tenure
probationary period at a maximum of eight years. The
Medical School uses eight years, so an assistant professor
would undergo a tenure review his or her seventh year.
LSA has its tenure clock window set at seven years, so he
or she would be reviewed in the sixth year.

When an assistant professor aims for tenure,
he or she will have to go through a final stage of
review before becoming an associate.
The long form review starts at the depart-
mental level, where a committee of tenured
faculty members examines the candidate's
credentials and performance while taking into
consideration internal and external letters of
evaluation. The committee then makes a ten-
ure recommendation to the dean of the school.
Following the recommendation, the dean
adds a letter to the assistant professor's case-
book, which also includes a teaching statement,
research statement, curriculum vitae, course
evaluations and external letters from "arm's
length" reviewers - colleagues from peer insti-
tutions who don't have strong personal ties to
the person under review.

After the dean's letter, the assistant profes-
sor's casebook is sent to the provost, where two
additional expert reviewers, including Whit-
man, start evaluating them.
About 200 casebooks are reviewed each year
over a period of approximately two months.
Finally, the provost makes a recommen-
dation to the University's Board of Regents,
which typically makes the final tenure deci-
sions at their May meeting. The final stage of
the tenure process can take many months.
AIMING FOR A HIGHER STANDARD
"It's not like you're free from pressures,"
Whitman said of the post-tenure period. "You
just have different pressures."
Associate professors are working toward

their next major promotion: full professorship.
The next promotion usually arrives with their
second major academic accomplishment, like
publishing a book.
LSA professors have a guaranteed salar
while tenure-track and tenured professors in
the Medical School are responsible for half
of their salaries, which come from research
grants. Grants are used to fund their research,
their salaries and the salaries of researchers in
their lab.
A guaranteed salary could cause a lack o4
motivation among professors who've already
obtained tenure.
But Poe said this wasn't usually the case,
since a combination of peer and self-applied
pressure motivates professors to continue
