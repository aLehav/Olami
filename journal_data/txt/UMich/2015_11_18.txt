ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Assembly hopes 

updates will increase 
student activity in 

the building

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Renovation 
plans 
for 
the 

Michigan 
Union 
are 
moving 

forward.

Loren Rullman, associate vice 

president for student life, spoke 
with Central Student Government 
at their weekly meeting Tuesday to 
discuss the plans and gather input 
on the design process.

During the meeting, CSG 

also heard from Trey Boynton, 
the director of Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs.

Representatives from Workshop 

Architects, one of the three firms 
currently working on renovations 
to the Union, asked CSG members 
to provide feedback as to what 
they use the Union for and what 
changes they would like to see to 

the building. The architects plan to 
garner input through the Student 
Renovations Advisory Committee.

In 
addition 
to 
Workshop 

Architects, Rullman said two 
other architecture firms having 
been hired, including Integrated 
Design Solutions from Troy who 
specialize in student spaces, and 
Washington, D.C.-based Hartman-
Cox 
Architects, 
preservation 

architects hired to maintain the 
integrity of the original buildings.

Rullman said two of the firms had 

previously worked on renovation 
projects for the University. IDS 
and Hartman-Cox both worked 
on construction of the Munger 
Residence Hall and renovations to 
the East Quad Residence Hall and 
the Law Quadrangle.

Rullman 
said 
the 
project 

began with the Building a Better 
Michigan initiative in 2011, which 
lobbied the University to prioritize 
renovations 
for 
the 
student 

common spaces like recreation 
centers and unions.

Speakers criticize 
Gov. Snyder’s choice 
to pause efforts to 
welcome refugees

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

A day after Michigan Gov. 

Rick 
Snyder 
announced 

Michigan would attempt to 

block 
Syrian 
refugees 
from 

entering the state, the Children 
Welfare 
Student 
Association 

held a discussion Tuesday night 
addressing the needs of Syrian 
refugees in Michigan.

Snyder 
had 
previously 

implemented plans to accept an 
increased number of refugees 
fleeing violence in Syria, but 
has now said he wants to put 
those plans on hold following 
terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday 
that killed 129 people. Earlier 

this week, French authorities 
announced 
that 
one 
of 
the 

individuals likely involved in 
the attacks entered Europe as a 
refugee from Syria, though that 
theory was likely incorrect.

Organizers 
noted 
that 

planning for the event started at 
the beginning of the semester, 
preceding recent events, but 
that 
the 
conversation 
had 

become increasingly relevant 
in light of Snyder’s remarks. 
Thirty other governors have 

made similar remarks.

About 15 attendees, mostly 

School of Social Work students, 
listened to three panelists speak 
about 
the 
current 
situation, 

as well as the complex mental 
health needs of refugees and ways 
practitioners and social workers 
can address them.

Panelist Loubna Alkhayet, a 

clinical therapist from Waterford, 
Mich., said she thought Snyder’s 
decision was a poor one for the

ANN ARBOR

City to celebrate 

Indigenous Peoples 
Day in its place as 

official holiday

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Columbus Day is no more, at 

least in the city of Ann Arbor.

The Ann Arbor City Council 

voted unanimously on Monday to 
recognize the second Monday of 
October as Indigenous Peoples Day 
in lieu of Columbus Day.

The resolution was proposed 

by 
Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5), who 
said the idea for the resolution 
began over a year ago when other 
communities drew attention for 
honoring the area’s indigenous 
people instead of the explorer who 
was traditionally portrayed as the 
person who “discovered” America.

Warpehoski said a resolution 

did not go through last year in 
part because he wanted to seek the 
input and support of indigenous 
groups in the community.

“To make this change, it should 

be done in partnership with 
indigenous people and not just 
as an act of charity without their 
consultation,” Warpehoski said.

Warpehoski said he reached 

out to local schools and worked 
in partnership with Ypsilanti 
Mayor Amanda Edmonds to draft 
the final resolution. Without 
local 
tribal 
governments 
to 

consult, he instead contacted the 
University’s 
Native 
American 

Student Association and, through 
his partnership with Edmonds, 
the Eastern Michigan Native 
American Student Association.

“I grew up in a town in 

northern Wisconsin where there 
was a Ojibwe reservation on one 
side of me and a Potawatomi 
reservation on the other side of 
me,” Warpehoski said. “They 
were local tribal institutions that 
were available for contact. That’s 
not something we have here 
currently in Washtenaw County, 
so finding indigenous leaders is a 
different process.”

Public Policy senior Isa Gaillard, 

co-chair of the Native American 
Student 
Association 
at 
the 

University, said his organization 
proposed adding language to the

Along with a panel of local 

professionals and professors, 
Lucas Kirkpatrick, an assistant 
sociology professor at Southern 
Methodist 
University, 

discussed the launch of his new 
book “Reinventing Detroit: 
The Politics of Possibility” on 
Tuesday.

Edited 
by 
Kirkpatrick 

and Michael Peter Smith, 
a professor of community 
studies 
at 
University 
of 

California, Davis, the book 
comprises chapters written by 
various experts in urban policy, 
including professors from the 
University. The compilation 
aims to discuss the challenges 
Detroit faces and the methods 
currently being employed to 

overcome them.

In 
July 
2013, 
Detroit 

declared 
bankruptcy 
and 

was placed under the control 
of an emergency manager. 
In December 2014, the city 
announced its exit from 
bankruptcy and control of 
the city was fully returned to 
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. 
The city has also struggled 
to cope with blight, crime, 
political corruption and a 
job loss.

Georgetown 
University 

President 
John 
DeGioia 

approved 
the 
renaming 
of 

two buildings on the school’s 
Washington, D.C. campus at the 
behest of the Black Leadership 
Forum and other concerned 
groups, The Hoya reported 
Saturday.

The 
buildings’ 
original 

namesakes 
honored 
former 

university presidents who were 
instrumental in the sale of 272 
slaves to a Louisiana plantation 
in 1838 to help pay off campus 
debt.

The two buildings, which 

had been known for years as 
Mulledy Hall and McSherry 

Hall, have been given the 
interim names Freedom Hall 
and 
Remembrance 
Hall, 

respectively.

Local, state leaders talk Asian 
Americans in public service

Panelists cite 

stereotypes about 

personality, aptitude 

as challenges

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Asian Americans involved in 

local and state government spoke 
at the University on Monday about 
issues facing Asian Americans 
working in public service.

Hosted by the South Asian 

Awareness Network, the panel 
featured three Asian-American 
leaders in government: Mumtaz 
Haque, a member of the Michigan 
Civil 
Rights 
Commission 

and a Detroit Public School 
administrator; Andrew Kim, the 
legislative director of the Macomb 
County Board of Commissioners; 
and state Rep. Stephanie Chang 
(D–Detroit), 
the 
first 
Asian-

American woman in Michigan’s 

legislature.

All 
three 
panelists 
said 

stereotypes are one of the biggest 
challenges Asian Americans face 
in a professional environment. 
Kim said because of his race, 
people often assume he lacks 
charisma 
and 
works 
better 

with mathematics than other 
disciplines.

“I think we get a lot of 

stereotypes and a lot of ignorance 
of 
who 
they 
think 
Asian 

Americans are, and sometimes 
that 
ignorance 
and 
those 

stereotypes 
undermine 
your 

abilities,” Kim said. “I would 
always get comments like ‘Hey, 
Andrew is a good analytics guy, 
but he’s not a good politics guy.’ ”

Haque said she found herself 

feeling like she needed to prove 
that she was capable of taking 
action because of her more 
reserved nature.

“(Asian Americans) are very 

reserved and we think before we 
speak, and that is taken sometimes 
as us being a person who is not 

aggressive enough to make things 
happen,” Haque said. “We are 
quiet workers, but sometimes 
that is misunderstood for being 
less aggressive or effective, so we 
really need to speak up for the 
right cause.”

Chang primarily spoke about 

her experience as an Asian 
American running for public 
office in a predominately Black 
district. The area of Detroit she 
represents is 39 percent Black.

She noted that despite initially 

having concerns about running 
in the district due to her race, 
she found most of her hesitations 
unfounded. 

“When I was deciding whether 

or not I wanted to run, I went 
back and forth between yes and 
no for a long time. But part of the 
reason why I was hesitant was I 
thought being Asian American 
was going to be a barrier,” Chang 
said. “There are definitely a lot 
of barriers externally, but I think 
that sometimes we create our 
own barriers in addition to the 
ones that other people create.”

Panelists also offered advice 

to Asian-American students who 
hope to get involved in public 
service.

Haque said students should 

find a mentor and volunteer in 
their communities.

“Find somebody who motivates 

you, who you think could be your 
role model, and get involved in the 
community around you,” she said. 
“There are so many nonprofit 
organizations around you, and 
that is how I started, because my 
heart was into it.”

Chang, who is a University 

alum, said students need to 
remember to look at the world 
outside of just the University 
campus.

“The University of Michigan 

and Ann Arbor can kind of 
feel like a bubble,” Chang said. 
“Sometimes it’s hard, especially 
if you don’t have a car, but it’s 
important to really be involved in 
things outside of campus.”

Group calls on ‘U’ to raise 
minimum hourly wage to $15

Proposed figure 
would be almost 
double the state 

mandated hourly pay

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Students from all three Uni-

versity of Michigan campuses 
filled the Betty Ford auditorium 
in Weill Hall on Tuesday to advo-
cate for a University-wide mini-
mum wage hike.

The event was held specifically 

for working students — many 
of whom have minor criminal 
records, their own young children 
or come from financially unstable 
backgrounds — to share their 
own personal financial struggles 
and their experience living off 
University wages.

The Student Labor Coalition 

organized the gathering to emu-
late a wage board, which in some 
states or municipalities is empow-
ered to determine and enact an 
adequate minimum wage. The 
event was modeled on the New 
York City Wage Board, which 
passed a minimum wage hike for 
fast food workers that was later 
adopted statewide.

Though the state of Michi-

gan does not have such a board, 

organizers intended for the 
simulation to allow students and 
community members the oppor-
tunity to consider the impacts of 
wages at the University.

During the event, students 

called 
on 
the 
University 
to 

increase the wage it pays campus 
hourly workers, which is often $10 
per hour or less for many student 
jobs, according to a Student Labor 
Coalition press release. Attendees 
expressed concerns, in particular, 
with the high costs of necessary 
expenditures, like tuition, books 
and technology, as well as paying 
off student debts and the cost of 
living off campus in Ann Arbor.

Student Labor Coalition said 

they are in favor of raising the Uni-
versity’s minimum wage to $15 per 
hour — nearly double the state’s 
minimum wage of $8.15 per hour.

Members of the student orga-

nization estimated that imple-
menting the increase would cost 
the University less than $20 mil-
lion per year, according to the 
press release.

If the minimum wage on cam-

pus is increased to $15 per hour, 
the University would be one of a 
handful of universities making 
the change. The University of 
California system and the Uni-
versity of Washington in Seattle 
plan on paying $15 per hour to 
minimum-wage employees on 
their campuses.

The mock wage board consist-

ed of four speakers, who, along 
with the student speakers, dis-
cussed the influence raising the 
minimum wage to $15 per hour 
would have at the University. The 
board included Katie Oppenheim, 
president of the Nurses Union at 
the University, and David Reyn-
olds, who works at the Center of 
Labor and Community Studies at 
U-M Dearborn. Rackham student 
Austin McCoy and Chris McKin-
ney, the director of Youth Poverty 
Project, a nonprofit organization 
in Detroit dedicated to helping 
low-income students with college 
finances, were also members of 
the board.

Those on the board responded 

to students’ stories with sugges-
tions of how to make a difference 
in the current minimum-wage 
environment.

McKinney specifically spoke 

about the difficulties students 
experience 
when 
employers 

require what he deemed unnec-
essary 
background 
informa-

tion, like an applicant’s parental 
obligations, that could make the 
applicant seem less employable.

“We do need to have this con-

versation and we do need to vote,” 
McKinney said. “But we do need 
to have other conversations . . 
. we don’t have to disclose our 
past (to employers) because this

will come from student fees, but 
contributions were also made by 
the Office of Student Life, funds 
generated by parking permits 
and 
the 
University 
Athletic 

Department.

“There’s about $80 million 

allocated to this project,” Rullman 
said. “I say somewhere in the 
neighborhood of half of that is 
going to fixing the plumbing 
which was put in in 1919.”

Jan van den Kieboom, founder 

and 
principal 
of 
Workshop 

Architects, said the Union was 
built for a smaller student body 
with different interests, and no 
longer reflects the University 
culture.

LSA junior Maddie Levine said 

the Union is meant to be a hub for 
students and would like to see 
better food and shopping options 
as well as study spaces.

“This isn’t a place I would bring 

people now because I don’t think 
there’s anything special or unique 
about it,” she said.

CSG said they would also like 

to see improvements to their 
chambers.

“This is supposed to be a 

community space,” Charlton said. 
“If we were to open up the room to 
community members, they would 
have difficulty fitting in here — 
this space is not conducive to that.”

Public Policy junior Thomas 

Hislop said there should be more 
meeting spaces for the various 
organizations on campus.

“We feel like there should be 

spaces for the organizations that 
already exist,” Hislop said.

Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs

Boynton said CSG and MESA 

have 
partnered 
on 
several 

initiatives, and noted the office is 
for everyone and not exclusively 
for communities of color. Shee 
said the program is launching 
new initiatives regarding walk-in 
advising for students who want 
to launch new programs of their 
own.

Boynton 
also 
touched 
on 

the recent Race and Ethnicity 
Requirement forum hosted by 
LSA student government, and said 
talking across differences is a core 
capacity students will need in the 

professional world.

“I just looked at a report that 

talked about inclusive leadership,” 
Boynton said. “The report was 
from six countries and Fortune 
500 companies, and they really 
said that in order to be innovative 
and successful, you need people 
who have culturally competent 
skills.”

Boynton 
spoke 
about 
the 

upcoming changes in the works 
for MESA.

“What 
we’ve 
piloted 
this 

semester are race and ethnicity 
workshops because it is important, 
relevant, a critical skill to talk 
about race, and we think it’s a skill 
people want to learn,” she said.

Resolutions

Central Student Government 

passed 
three 
resolutions 

unanimously Tuesday, one which 
amended operating procedures 
to change how assembly member 
absences are counted.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Joe 

Ambrose said he was disappointed 
by the lack of attendance at the last 
CSG meeting and the number of 
abstentions during the voting on a 
proposed resolution.

resolution calling on the city to 
recognize the indigenous Odawa, 
Ojibwe, Potawatomi and Wyandot 
tribes who lived on what is now the 
University’s campus.

“We really think that that’s an 

important part of the proposal, 
talking about the land grant 
connection and how that land was 
a gift from the indigenous people 
here with the hope that their 
children would be educated there,” 
Gaillard said.

Gaillard said Warpehoski spoke 

at NASA meetings with the aim of 
involving the student group in the 
process. Though Gaillard initially 
was surprised a councilmember 
wanted the help of a student group 
in crafting the resolution, he said 
NASA was ultimately happy to help.

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman 
(D–Ward 
3), 
an 

LSA senior, said Michigan was 

historically home to native people 
who were disenfranchised and 
mistreated, and changing the 
name of the holiday is a small step 
to honor those individuals.

“I think Ann Arbor should be a 

progressive leader, and one way in 
which we can do that is to in some 
small way right a historic wrong of 
our nation,” Ackerman said.

Ackerman said he was surprised 

action hadn’t been taken already.

“I was shocked to hear that 

Councilmember 
Briere 
had 

brought up that this was brought 
to the table in decades previous 
and that no action had been taken,” 
Ackerman said. “I’m glad that we 
can correct that now.”

Councilmember 
Chip 
Smith 

(D–Ward 5) said the resolution was 
long overdue and though he was 
not on City Council when the first 
resolution was proposed, he would 
have supported it.

“I think what’s changed is a 

better 
cultural 
understanding 

of some of the insensitivities of 

some of these traditions that 
we’ve established,” he said. “I 
just think that the times have 
changed pretty significantly in 
the last 20 years and I think the 
time was right to do this.”

Warpehoski said the feedback 

he received from the resolution 
was overwhelmingly positive, and 
though he was prepared for some 
pushback, the unanimous vote did 
not come as a surprise.

“I think we all share a hope that 

this is more than just a changing 
on the name on the calendar, but 
it becomes an opportunity for a 
deeper community conversation 
about what’s happening with 
indigenous 
communities,” 

Warpehoski 
said. 
“It 
is 
a 

stereotype that Indians are only 
in history books for many people 
and one of my goals is that 
through the education effort that 
groups like the Native American 
Student Associations are doing 
they will get a chance to say yes, 
they’re still here.”

by summarizing the book’s three 
themes: first, that Detroit is not 
unique; second, that there’s a 
need to change perceptions of 
the city’s economic situation; 
and third, that a forward-focused 
outlook is important.

To introduce the first theme, 

he used Dallas, Texas, as a case 
study for showing Detroit is not 
totally unique in its challenges. 
He referenced chapters written by 
Margaret Dewar, a professor in the 
University’s Urban and Regional 
Planning Program.

“They point out the empirical 

benefits of studying Detroit and 
that empirical lessons we draw 
from Detroit are generalizable in 
other urban contexts,” he said.

Dewar, who spoke on the panel, 

said placing Detroit in the context 
of other cities was important for 
learning something from the 
city’s challenges.

“Detroit is an extreme case 

— what good does an extreme 
case do when it is an outlier?” she 
said. “When it is placed against 
knowledge in certain ways, then 
you can get new insights that add 
to that knowledge.”

Kirkpatrick cited his experience 

working in Dallas on a New Cities 
Foundation initiative, which pairs 

up city officials with faculty and 
student researchers to address 
urban issues facing the city.

“An observer might reasonably 

assume that those two cities would 
face fundamentally different types 
of challenges,” he said. “But in 
my work at SMU … the thing I’ve 
taken is the stunning overlap in the 
challenges facing Dallas and the 
challenges facing Detroit.”

Those similarities, he added, 

include issues like segregation and 
concentrated patterns of blight.

Beyond acknowledging Detroit’s 

challenges, Kirkpatrick said it was 
also important to think about how 
those challenges were created, and 
what they mean for the city today.

He said that mindset entails 

“rereading the past that brought 
us to the point of crisis and then 
reinterpreting where we are now, 
and reinterpreting the possible 
paths forward for the city and for 
urban communities.”

Kirkpatrick said several chapters 

in the book, including “Framing 
Detroit” by Jamie Peck, a professor 
and research chair of urban and 
regional political economy at the 
University of British Columbia, 
and “Market Discipline” by John 
Gallagher, a Detroit Free Press 
reporter, speak to this point.

“The real villain in this story is 

not the people of Detroit — they 
are victims,” Kirkpatrick said. 
“Rather, the real structural causes 

for Jamie Peck are austerity, fiscal 
federalism, 
and 
imposition 
of 

market discipline.”

Austerity refers to the fiscal 

policy 
practice 
of 
reducing 

expenditures, often sharply, to 
respond to budget deficits. Fiscal 
federalism, a similar concept, 
considers which functions of 
government should be centralized 
at the federal level and which 
should be devolved to the states. 
Market discipline is related to 
how the transparency and risk 
attached to a specific endeavor 
are communicated.

David Fasenfest, Wayne State 

University assistant professor of 
sociology, said much of Detroit’s 
decline can be tied to structural 
market forces, such as the decline 
in the automobile industry. 

Kirkpatrick closed by asking the 

panel a question: How is Detroit 
doing now? Panelists cited both 
positives and negatives of the city 
in response, saying it depended on 
which part of Detroit you were in.

While some areas like Midtown 

are growing, with long waitlists for 
apartments, other neighborhoods 
are still receding and continuing 
to face issues of foreclosure or 
gentrification, Gallagher said.

“We have a long way to go, but 

it does feel different to me in the 
last three years than in the last 25,” 
Gallagher said. “We are in the front 
end of it.”

state. In the last two years, 200 
Syrian refugees have settled in 
Michigan, a number second to only 
California and Texas.

“It’s hard to watch our elected 

officials taking it out on the most 
vulnerable people, while forgetting 
that these refugees are the first 
victims of these terrorists,” she said.

University alum Sanja Savic-

Berhamovic, who sought asylum 
in Denmark from the Bosnian War, 
said she saw several parallels with 
her experience and the current 
experience of Syrian refugees.

“We came from a civilized 

country … and it was very 
humiliating to be in a position 
where we’re sleeping in tents and 
people are coming and taking 
our pictures like we’re in a zoo,” 
Savic-Berhamovic said. “What’s 
important is that (refugees) feel 

like they’re understood.”

Arguments over policies, all 

three panelists agreed, tend to 
drown out important discussions 
of accommodation.

“Silence has become the norm 

for (refugees),” panelist Najah 
Bazzy said. “They’re afraid of the 
regime they came from as well as 
the politics of their host country. 
Practitioners 
are 
powerful 
in 

helping the refugees feel secure.”

Bazzy, who is the founder 

of 
Zaman 
International, 
a 

humanitarian 
organization 

based in Dearborn, added that 
it is important for mental health 
practitioners to understand the 
context of the refugee’s situation in 
providing care.

“There 
are 
educational, 

economic, political and legal and 
cultural factors,” Bazzy said. “We 
need to offer safe (spaces) for them.”

Panelists urged attendees to 

take action by vocalizing the 
importance 
of 
providing 
for 

refugees, especially in light of 
Snyder’s decision.

“Being vocal and joining groups 

already working with refugees is 
important … (and) social media 
presence as well,” Alkhayet said.

Several student groups on 

campus have said they plan to 
implement 
several 
initiatives 

in the future, including more 
dialogues 
for 
CWSA 
and 
a 

campaign, 
led 
by 
Students 

Allied for Freedom and Equality, 
to petition Snyder to reopen 
Michigan to Syrian refugees.

LSA senior Dana Basha, who 

attended the event, emphasized 
the importance of empathizing 
with refugees.

“It is so simple to become 

desensitized to the suffering that 
so many of these refugees have 
gone through, and look at them as 
just another statistic or number,” 
Basha said. “There is no doubt that 
as Americans we can bring them 
steps closer to that safety.”

is America and America was built 
on new chances, and have not just 
this discussion, but discussions 
on increased access to education. 
There’s a lot of intersectionality 
when it comes to these issues. It’s 
not just fight for 15.”

Public Policy junior Robert 

Dickinson, who is president of the 
United Students Against Sweat-
shops chapter on campus, said 
because the Student Labor Coali-
tion is not an official group on 
campus, he helped the organiza-
tion coordinate Tuesday’s event.

Dickinson said because he 

gets paid $9 through working in 
the dining halls, expenses such 
as paying the rent can often be 
difficult, especially in a city like 
Ann Arbor.

“My parents don’t make a lot of 

money, and they ask myself and 

my sisters for money sometimes, 
and it sucks having to say I don’t 
have anything,” Dickinson said. 
“It puts a lot of strains on relation-
ships with people who don’t worry 
about money, because if people 
want to go out to dinner, it’s not 
really an option for me.”

An LSA senior didn’t want to 

be identified due to the sensitive 
nature of the topic, said her cam-
pus job in a University depart-
ment doesn’t pay enough to cover 
the bills.

“As someone who does school 

full time and a student worker, 
there was a time when I was work-
ing a University job and then I had 
to have three outside in addition to 
that,” she said. “I’ve done an entire 
school year working four jobs 
before just to pay for my tuition 
and pay for my bills, while I was 
taking full-time classes — two 
semesters of 16 credits and work-
ing four jobs at the same time. 
Needless to say, my academics 

suffered, and now that’s causing a 
problem for my grad school apps, 
because now I’m not as competi-
tive, because I’ve had to work my 
whole education.”

LSA junior Rebecca Wren, a 

member of the Student Labor 
Coalition, said she is both a work-
ing-class and first-generation col-
lege student. Having grown up 
watching her family work for low 
wages, she said, she did not always 
understand how hard they had to 
work to make minimum wage.

“The last few years I lived in 

an apartment, and that’s where it 
really hits you really hard, because 
there’s rent, and there’s bills, and 
you’re responsible for yourself all 
of a sudden,” Wren said.

Wren said she hopes to see at 

least $15 an hour as the base pay 
across campus. “I feel like it is 
higher education’s role to make 
changes and to reduce inequality 
and they’re not doing it right now,” 
she said.

Andrew Kim, the legislative director of the Macomb Civil Rights Commission, and state Rep. Stephanie Chang (D–

panel at Rackham Amphitheatre on Tuesday. 

“I 
just 
really

some 
disappointment 

that I had about the turnout of 
last week’s meeting, and I know 
that we all have a lot of busy

ourselves on the issue, and I was 

really at a loss for words at how 
many abstentions because it’s 
really doing a disservice to those 
who elected you.”

Public Policy junior Lucky 

Lakshman Mulpuri said the low 
attendance of CSG at assembly 
meetings and their own events 

reflects poorly on the body.

“I 
don’t

clapping when a member who is 
not even elected to the assembly,

repeated e-mails for assembly

The politics of terrorism
T

he 
University 
of 
Maryland’s 

Global Terrorism Database defines 
terrorism as “the threatened or 

actual use of illegal force 
and violence by a non-state 
actor to attain a political, 
economic, 
religious, 
or 

social goal through fear, 
coercion, or intimidation.”

Last 
week, 
several 

protests and collectivist 
actions 
occurred, 

demonstrationg solidarity 
against acts of domestic 
terrorism which manifest 
themselves 
in 
police 

brutality (a generous use of 
the word), white supremacy and extremism. 
Yet 
U.S. 
citizens 
flippantly 
associate 

terrorism with international trepidations, 
though domestic terrorism has historically 
flourished in the United States. A Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention study found 
that 406,496 people have died on U.S. soil by 
firearms between 2001 and 2013, compared to 
the 350 U.S. citizens killed from incidents of 
terrorism overseas.

A New York Times article stated, “Since 

Sept. 11, 2001, nearly twice as many people 
have been killed by white supremacists, 
antigovernment fanatics and other non-
Muslim extremists than by radical Muslims.”

More U.S. citizens are victims of gun 

violence and social stigma within our borders 
than abroad, yet the media continues to 
create a stereotype and distort the image 
of what a terrorist is. Unfortunately, this 
stereotype excludes U.S. citizens (specifically 
white citizens) from its denotation. People of 
color who commit acts of violence are seen 
as inherently evil, as thugs and terrorists, 
while white people who impose violence are 
thought to have a mental illness, or their acts 
can be justified as self-defense. Both state 
and non-state actors in the United States have 
committed and continue to commit acts of 
terrorism under the guise of democracy and 
white supremacy.

After 
9/11, 
then-

President George W. Bush 
and several international 
dignitaries from countries 
like Norway, Japan and 
Australia took proactive 
steps to fight in the “Global 
War on Terrorism.” This 
worldwide 
campaign 

included 
89 
countries 

that granted overflight 
authority for U.S. military 
aircrafts, 23 countries agreeing to host U.S. 
forces in offensive operations, intelligence 
cooperation with nations and a host of other 
multinational declarations of support.

The war on terrorism was hyper-politicized 

to advance geopolitical politics. According to 
the Global Terrorism Database — which has 
published data about terrorist attacks around 
the world from 1970 to 2014 — there were 
fewer terrorist attacks and attempted attacks 
in the United States in 2014 than there were 
in 1970s; however, recent attacks are more 
deadly than those in the past.

This doesn’t negate that transnational 

terrorism isn’t active and prominent threat in 
today’s global society. The U.S. Department 
of State reported 6,771 terrorist attacks 
occurred worldwide in 2012. Pakistan, 
Iraq and Afghanistan topped the list of the 
countries with the most terrorist attacks. 
The largest number of deaths per attack have 
occurred in Syria and Nigeria. Behind these 
facts and statistics are faces and lives.

Think back to April 2014, when the 

terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 
Nigerian girls. Or to the summer of 2014, 
when an influx of Central American women 
and children refugees were (and still are) 
fleeing from violence looking for sanctuary 
and protection in the United States. At the 
beginning of this year, bombs terrorized 
families during the holiday season in Ukraine. 
The Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS, 
was responsible for killing 38 people in 
Tunisia in June of this year, along with over 
250,000 Syrians.

In the United States, an incalculable amount 

of deaths of Black and brown people executed by 
police officers and extremists has skyrocketed 

in the past three years. How proactive has the 
United States been in ensuring these acts of 
terror are prevented? These genocides and 
grotesque acts against humanity violate the 
universal human rights the United States 
champions, yet neglects to hold itself and other 
countries accountable for.

Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops have 

invaded Afghanistan and Iraq and have killed 
and displaced a massive amount of Afghanis 
and Iraqis all in the name of democracy and 
protecting international security. The deaths 
of Black and brown people are attributed to 
the illusion of self-defense, like in the cases 
of George Zimmerman and Darren Wilson, 
when in actuality, they’re due to racial and 
religious bias. Yet, the media didn’t advertise 
or even consider these actions to fall within 
the boundaries of terrorism.

When members of the Black Lives Matter 

movement are labeled “domestic terrorists” 
by state officials, when the nation fails to 
recognize the Charleston shooting as a 
terrorist attack, when a 114-page report 
about 
Adam 
Lanza’s 
life 
attempts 
to 

rationalize his actions for murdering 20 
children and six adults in Sandy Hook, when 
massacres like the Sikh temple shooting 
and Aurora movie theater occur, and when 
a Kansas abortion clinic doctor is murdered 
by a pro-life advocate, there’s a lack of 
consensus on who and what is terrorized, 
creating huge discrepancies in terrorism’s 
definition. These incidents exemplify what 
U.S. citizens’ perception terrorism is, who 
it affects, when it’s justified, when our 
government and military decide to condone 
it and which victims of terrorism deserve 
the United State’s compassion, all of which 
are subjected to the media’s interpretation of 
events and strategic political agendas by our 
 

nation’s leaders.

U.S. media and political leaders are always 

on the offensive, asserting to the mass public 
that the United States is at war: wars on 
poverty, wars on crime, world wars, civil 
wars, wars on terrorism. How about we 

wage a war for peace? A 
war for solidarity? A war 
 

for justice?

In our microworld as 

university students, we 
have to be active solicitors 
of peace and security. 
How can students hold the 
University accountable to 
ensure that students will 
not be terrorized by their 
race, 
religion, 
ability, 

educational 
status 
or 

sexual orientation? How can students, staff 
and faculty collectively build inclusive spaces 
to support the diversity we already have? Acts 
of violence are continuously thwarted toward 
our most vulnerable populations (children, 
the elderly, women, transgender men and 
women, people with disabilities) on this 
campus and in the Ann Arbor community, 
in the United States and worldwide. How 
are we training and challenging ourselves 
to eradicate this violence? Are we really 
educating ourselves to be global citizens of 
this world?

Global crisis and acts of terror occur every 

day. If the University seeks to produce the 
“leaders and the best,” we need to know our 
history. By our history, I do not only mean the 
history that tells the legacy of our identities, 
but also the history of our world. As global 
citizens, we need to know more than China’s 
Silk Road, Marco Polo’s adventures and the 
Azteca empire.

We need to understand global political, 

economic and social histories at their cores. 
We need to understand the whys, hows, whats 
and whens in contemporary history that 
manifest the trends in terrorist acts today. We 
need to abort the United States’ self-centered 
and self-righteous mentality, and identify our 
own instances of terrorism as we consider 
deploying our manpower who wages wars 
against injustices we have yet to cease. We 
need to work toward identifying the politics 
within our structures that allow terrorism to 
manifest and plague our progress as a global 
society and as individuals.

Housing help for the homeless

JASON ROWLAND | VIEWPOINT

The bus sped away into the night, 

leaving its passengers stranded 
in its dust. Huddled in the frigid 
air, the six forsaken men glanced 
around at the place they would 
come to know as the Delonis Center. 
In front of them stood the center, 
full of other transplanted homeless 
people; behind them was their 
rights and dignity. With no other 
option, they made their way inside. 
Once in, they were met by scores 
of others in their exact situation: 
loaded into cars, taxis and buses, 
and deserted at the center.

This isn’t an isolated scenario in 

some distant city; this is the reality 
of winter nights here in Ann Arbor.

Whether 
or 
not 
we’d 
like 

to admit it, Ann Arbor has a 
homelessness problem. However, 
unlike most cities, Ann Arbor’s 
situation isn’t a result of the 
misfortune of its own residents. 
In fact, the number of homeless 
Washtenaw 
County 
residents 

decreased by 24 percent between 
2013 and 2015, and Washtenaw 
County aims to eliminate veteran 
homelessness by next year through 
cataloging the county’s homeless 
citizens and matching them with 
 

housing options.

So 
where 
are 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

homeless coming from?

Unfortunately, many communities 

in Southeast Michigan bus their 
homeless residents to Ann Arbor’s 
homeless and warming centers in 
a practice known as “Greyhound 
therapy.” Ann Arbor’s shelters, while 
adequately funded and well staffed, 
just do not have the bottomless 
pockets 
needed 
to 
continue 

accommodating these newcomers.

Once homeless people arrive in 

Tree Town, a daunting environment 
greets them, due mainly to the 
fact that Ann Arbor is one of the 
most expensive cities in the state. 
Necessities — food, water and 
clothing — are undoubtedly more 
costly than where they came from.

In a similar vein, housing in 

the city is famously known to be 
costly. According to Zillow.com 
— an online service that provides 
users with information on housing 
information such as market price 
and past sales — the average home 
in Ann Arbor costs more than 

$300,000. Rent is similarly pricey, 
making it nearly impossible for 
a displaced homeless person to 
establish a foothold in the city.

So what can be done to tackle 

this issue?

It turns out that the state of 

Michigan makes it very hard for 
local governments to easily offer 
affordable housing. For example, 
the Leasing of Private Residential 
Property Act of 1988, which is still 
an active Michigan law, states that 
local municipalities do not have the 
right to “enact, maintain, or enforce 
an ordinance or resolution that 
would have the effect of controlling 
the amount of rent charged.”

In effect, Michigan cities cannot 

force developers to follow rent-
controlled policies. This prohibits 
the city from keeping rents at the 
level it deems appropriate and 
instead allows people’s lives to be 
dictated by the hand of the market.

This total ban of rent control 

is relatively common and isn’t 
inherently 
bad. 
Rent-controlled 

units offer little incentive for 
landlords to do renovations, and 
decrease property tax-revenues. 
Therefore, 
housing 
shortages 

can arise as the demand for low-
priced housing outpaces the supply. 
However, when a complete ban on 
rent control is coupled with the fact 
that the state also bans mandatory 
inclusionary zoning, we arrive at 
Ann Arbor’s current affordable 
housing crisis.

Mandatory inclusionary zoning 

means that city governments can 
mandate that housing developers 
designate a percentage of their 
units for low-income residents. 
While not the foolproof solution 
to the city’s housing crisis, this 
effort is a practical way to begin the 
process. Yet when bills in support 
of mandatory inclusionary zoning 
reach the floor, they don’t make 
it out of committee — perhaps 
because they’re seen as creating an 
unfavorable climate for business 
as developers have no choice but 
to accept the lost revenue from 
not being able to rent their unit at 
market price.

A more popular alternative to 

mandating inclusionary zones is 
building government housing for 

low-income residents, commonly 
known 
as 
Section 
8 
housing. 

However, it’s been shown that 
when applying to jobs, residents of 
such low-income neighborhoods 
are discriminated against due to 
what’s commonly referred to as 
postcode discrimination.

Unlike 
government 
housing, 

inclusionary zones force developers 
to integrate units for low-income 
residents into the properties that 
house people who aren’t homeless, 
allowing people to free themselves of 
the discrimination that comes with 
living in neighborhoods exclusively 
designated to homeless populations. 
Additionally, 
the 
prohibition 
of 

inclusionary zoning often leads to 
economic segregation, a small tax 
base, underfunded schools and, 
consequently, few opportunities to 
improve and break this cycle.

Furthermore, 
many 
of 

the 
United 
States’ 
lowest 

income earners are minorities. 
Inclusionary zoning allows for not 
only more economically diverse 
neighborhoods, but also for ones 
that are more ethnically diverse.

With 
the 
existing 
property 

laws in place, Ann Arbor — like all 
municipalities in Michigan — is left 
with the option to implement what’s 
known as voluntary inclusionary 
zoning, a policy that allows the city 
to offer incentives to developers 
who 
build 
low-income 
units. 

While this is better than nothing, 
it isn’t enough. Legislative action 
must be taken to allow for cities to 
implement mandatory inclusionary 
zoning and rent control, but this 
requires a concerted effort to show 
Lansing that people are in support 
of the change.

It’s our job as residents of Ann 

Arbor to protect the city’s less 
fortunate, to end the bussing of 
homeless people and to stand up 
for affordable housing. This can be 
achieved by a myriad of methods 
— from voting for candidates who 
champion 
affordable 
housing 

measures 
to 
contacting 
our 

representatives to taking to the 
streets yourself.

We must push for change because 

we are the voice for the voiceless.

Pushing Back on Privilege

TONI WANG | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

A couple of weeks ago, I was 

walking through the Diag with a 
friend when I saw someone I did 
not recognize running toward me. 
Like many folks, when I see a person 
headed in my direction, at whatever 
pace, my initial thought is not that 
they are intending on body-slamming 
me into the ground. So imagine my 
utter confusion when, less than a few 
seconds later, I was on the pavement, 
my legs tangled underneath a student 
who I have never met — the same 
student who had literally just shoved 
me over. Before I could even think 
about having any kind of reaction, 
he shot up off the ground and started 
shouting, “That’s a point! That’s a 
point!” while waving his pointer 
finger at me, and laughing with two 
of his friends who were standing 
by. He did not ask me if I was OK (I 
was not). He did not offer to help me 
up. He did not even take a second to 
acknowledge my existence. Instead, 
he ran away, grinning about the fact 
that he physically assaulted someone 
as she was walking to class. I found 
out later that this was something 
some fraternities were awarding 
pledge points for.

Last week, I met with one of 

my mentors and told her about 
what happened. It wasn’t until I 
finished speaking, and saw the look 
of disgust and horror on her face, 
that I realized I had been laughing 
throughout the entire story. What 
was initially something that left 
me shaking with anger and sadness 
turned into just another day in the 
life. I had normalized a completely 
dehumanizing experience, because, 
unfortunately, being made to feel 
lesser than, like an object, like an 
“other,” is not new for me.

As a queer-questioning woman of 

color, I have continuously struggled 
to find my voice and visibility on 
this campus and in this world. 

From 
having 
“chink” 
screamed 

at me from a car as a seven-year-
old first learning to ride a bike, to 
being called an “oriental princess” 
by a drunk upperclassman within 
days of coming to the University, 
discrimination has always been a 
part of my life and college story. Sadly, 
my experience is not a unique one. 
Students with disabilities, students 
of color, LGBTQ students and 
other students with marginalized 
identities are consistently silenced 
and made to feel invisible at this 
school. Not only are the people who 
hold these identities far and few here, 
but our issues are ignored and never 
taken seriously.

Obviously (or at least I hope it’s 

obvious), I’m not saying that all of 
these issues have occurred at the 
hands of members of Greek life, or, 
in this case, the Inter-Fraternity 
Council. Individuals in IFC are not 
the problem. Individuals in IFC who 
ignore, deny, and/or perpetuate the 
systems of power and privilege that 
birth these issues are a problem, 
as are individuals not in IFC who 
do the same. If you have always felt 
supported at this university and 
your identities not attacked (if you 
“identify” as a Michigan football 
fan and are relating this to what 
you felt after the loss to MSU, please 
sit down), then think about how 
these systems have played into that. 
Think about how we are socialized 
to believe the identities you hold are 
“normal,” and how people who don’t 
hold your identities have learned to 
expect disrespect and maltreatment.

I wish I didn’t need to include 

this paragraph, but it seems that 
no matter how many times I try to 
express this sentiment, some people 
will continue to miss the point and 
highlight my mention of Greek life 
as the most important factor of the 
story. It’s not. So here it is, right at 

the end so you will remember it: 
This is not an attack on Greek life. 
Again, in the exact same words: 
This. Is. Not. An. Attack. On. Greek. 
Life. You do not need to prove to 
me #NotAllGreekLife. If you are 
reading this and you are a cisgender, 
heterosexual, able-bodied, upper-
middle class white man (which, 
guessing by the demographics of this 
institution and not the demographics 
of 
people 
who 
actually 
read 

Michigan in Color, a vast majority 
of you are), this is also not an attack 
on you. This is me, expressing my 
anger, sharing my trauma, and 
spreading awareness of the flawed 
and oppressive system under which 
we all live, but from which only a 
select few of us benefit. This is me, 
trying to get you to understand that 
if you are a beneficiary of this system, 
you are supporting institutional 
oppression, whether you want to or 
not. And this is me, pleading with the 
last bit of patience I have left, that 
you play your part in dismantling or, 
at the very least, simply recognizing 
this system, so that the bigotry, 
exclusion and violence that exist on 
this campus will not be the defining 
characteristics of mine and so many 
others’ college experience.

If, after this, you still believe that 

purposely pushing someone over 
and potentially injuring them is OK, 
funny, your right or a goddamn game, 
you are living in the privileged reality 
that I am literally dedicating my 
entire life and career to deconstruct 
and destroy piece by fragile piece. 
I am a human being, not your point 
to earn through harassment and 
assault, and when the system that 
affords you your privilege is gone, 
you can bet that your pledge points 
won’t matter.

EVENT PREVIEW
‘Symphony in D’ 
returns to the D

Composer Tod 
Machover talks 

community, music 

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

The city of Detroit has a more 

storied history than the state 
of Michigan itself. Founded in 
1701 
by 

French 
colo-
nists, 
Detroit 
has had 
both 
towering 
highs 
and 
lethar-
gic lows. 
It was in 
Detroit 
that 
Henry 
Ford’s 
engine first sputtered to life, 
the genesis of a journey that 
would culminate in the city 
becoming the capital of the 
automobile industry and the 
fourth largest municipality in 
the United States. And it was 
Detroit in 2013 that witnessed 
the largest municipal bank-
ruptcy filing in U.S. history.

And yet, for all the highs 

and lows, one thing Detroit has 
always been is a place with a 
multifaceted populace, home to 
people from numerous different 
walks of life. It’s this diverse 
and vibrant image that com-
poser Tod Machover attempts 
to capture in his new piece, 
“Symphony in D,” which will 

premier this Friday with the 
Detroit Symphony Orchestra at 
Orchestra Hall in Midtown.

“I started this series of city 

symphonies about three years 
ago,” Machover said in a phone 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily, referring to a group of 
city-inspired works that began 
in a collaboration with the 
Toronto Symphony. “Detroit is 
the first city in the U.S. where 
we’ve done this project, and it’s 
… kind of been the dream city 
to do this project in, because 
there’s so much changing in 
Detroit now.”

According to Machover, there 

are many aspects of the city that 
make it a wonderful location for 
a project of this sort. Detroit’s 
recent struggles and rich his-
tory make it fertile ground for 
creative collaboration.

“It’s a noble, rich, fantas-

tic, industrial city with a lot of 
great musical history,” Macho-
ver said. “And every difficult 
thing about American society 
hit in Detroit all at once, start-
ing in the ’60s … and now every-
thing is being rethought. So a 
project like this, people are just 
so open in Detroit now to think 
about what’s possible … doing 
that through a piece of music — 
people have really responded.”

Machover, who is a profes-

sor of music and media at the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 

Technology Media Lab, has a 
thorough musical edification 
and vast experience with music 
technology and nontraditional 
composition methods. The son 
of a concert pianist, Macho-
ver attended Juilliard, where 
he studied with two titans of 
American 20th-century music, 

composers Elliott Carter and 
Roger Sessions.

“Elliott Carter in particu-

lar … he was probably the most 
creative composer I ever met,” 
Machover said of his former 
teacher. “I was inspired watch-
ing him think about music cre-
atively.”

Machover was also the first 

director of musical research 
at the Institut de Recherche 
et Coordination Acoustique/
Musique (IRCAM), founded by 
the legendary French avant-
garde composer Pierre Boulez. 
All these experiences have 
made 
Machover 
extremely 

well-suited for a creative proj-
ect like “Symphony in D.”

“Part of my work for a long 

time has been trying to use 
technology — or any means 
I could — to allow people to 
participate actively in musi-
cal experiences, whatever your 
background,” Machover said. 
“(The Detroit project) was a 
great moment to try to combine 
the two sides of my work. One 
is pushing the art form for-
ward, and the other is trying to 
involve the public.”

Throughout 
the 
piece, 

Machover engages with the 
community of Detroit, col-
laborating 
with 
many 
dif-

ferent artists, musicians and 
community members from the 
city. The symphony contains 
not only musical contributions 
from Detroit residents, but also 
sounds from the city submit-
ted by the public. Each of the 
symphony’s 
five 
movements 

reflects a different aspect of 
Detroit, from its automotive 
history to a vanished African-
American neighborhood to a

vision for the city’s future.

“By the time we got to 

Detroit I realized that what I 
really wanted to do was meet 
people personally. I wanted to 
explore the city myself and let 
people know what I imagined 
in the project,” Machover said. 
“I realized that the way to make 
this project work was really to 
have an open mind … I really 
came with an honest invitation 
to join me to explore the city, to 
teach me about the city and to 
figure out together what was 
worth telling.”

Drawing from his work at the 

MIT Media Lab, in one move-
ment Machover uses a software 
that he and his team developed 
in 2002. The software allows 
for 
non-musicians 
to 
com-

pose — in this case, a group of 
third graders from the Detroit 
Achievement Academy contrib-
ute musical material for the 
symphony.

“(The third graders) wrote 

original pieces about Detroit 
using software we have called 
‘Hyperscore’ that uses lines 
and color to allow anyone to 
write original music that then 
gets transcribed into tradition-

al notation,” Machover said.

Additionally, Machover has 

invited senior citizens to share 
their memories of the city, as 
well as the spoken-word artist 
Marsha Music and the writer 
Tonya Matthews to read their 
work on stage as part of the 
symphony.

“Detroit is a place where 

there really are incredible sto-
ries, people’s life stories, often 
that nobody had the chance to 
tell anybody,” Machover said. 
“So I thought there had to be a 
place for people’s voices in the 
symphony.”

For the final movement of 

the piece, there will be several 
Detroit-based musicians and 
groups performing on stage 
with the orchestra. Many of 
these musicians were people 
Machover 
met 
during 
the 

course of the project — some 
by pure coincidence, others 
through workshops and improv 
sessions.

“The fifth movement is the 

finale, called ‘Together in D,’ 
” Machover said. “The actual 
people I’ve met are so extraor-
dinary and their presence is so 
individualistic and powerful 

that there’s nothing like actual-
ly having some of them on stage 
as part of the performance.”

Also present will be an Afri-

can drummer, an electric bass-
ist, a techno-funk duo, an indie 
guitarist, four middle-school-
ers from the YouthVille after-
school program and a chorus 
from the Chaldean community 
— many of whom are Christian 
refugees from the Middle East.

“It was much later than 

usual for me that it turned into 
a piece,” Machover said, cit-
ing his open-minded approach 
to the project and the intense 
creative 
collaboration 
with 

various people from Detroit. 
“I think that’s a real strength 
about what this piece is.”

Made possible with the help 

of a grant from the Knight 
Foundation, the culmination of 
Machover’s Detroit project will 
premiere with the Detroit Sym-
phony Friday at 10:45 a.m. at 
Orchestra Hall, Max M. & Mar-
jorie S. Fisher Music Center, 
Midtown. An additional perfor-
mance will take place Saturday 
at 8 p.m., which will also broad-
cast in a live webcast available 
on dso.org/live.

TV REVIEW
‘PR: Junior’ is how 
reality TV should be

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

The Emmy-nominated series 

“Project Runway,” which has pro-
jected aspiring designers to suc-
cess in its 14 
seasons 
on 

Lifetime and 
Bravo, is giv-
ing the same 
opportunity 
to 12 emerg-
ing 
young 

designers in 
its 
spin-off 

series, “Proj-
ect Runway: 
Junior.” The 
group of tal-
ented young 
hopefuls — the youngest of whom 
is just 13 years old — approach the 
show and their first challenge with 
vibrant personalities, imagination 
and confidence.

The up-and-coming designers 

have a more clear sense of their 
personal aesthetics than I do of 
what my next meal will be. Their 
self-assuredness reminds us not 
to underestimate the immense 
talent teenagers are capable of. 
It takes more than just the abil-
ity to operate a sewing machine 
to face off in front of judges rank-
ing among fashion’s elite: super-
model and host Hannah Davis, 
Kelly Osbourne, designer Chris-
tian Siriano and Cosmopolitan and 
Seventeen Magazine executive 
fashion editor Aya Kanai.

Though Heidi Klum is absent, 

host Hannah Davis exudes Heidi 
in every way — from Klum’s ele-
gant yet slightly menacing man-
ner of speaking and intimidating 
beauty, to her mild playfulness. 
Davis hosts alongside Tim Gunn, 
whose forthright guidance serves 
as the holy grail of mentorship 
for aspiring designers. Matt, 17, 
who hails from Manhattan Beach, 
Calif., wastes no time in getting 
on Gunn’s good side, gushing “I’m 
better now that I’m in the presence 

of a god,” after Gunn approaches 
him to ask how he’s faring through 
their first challenge.

As typical with reality competi-

tions, the strongest personalities 
are given more screen time early 
on. Matt is among these person-
alities, which also include Jack-
son (15, Minneapolis), Zachary 
(16, Berkeley, Calif.) and Maya (13, 
Maumee, Ohio). It’s refreshing to 
see the liberty with which these 
designers are able to express them-
selves on the show, which may not 
necessarily be the case for them 
back home — as is typically the 
case with young teens whose con-
fidence and talent rank above aver-
age of their peers. And they have 
the personalities to prove it. 

The designers are welcomed to 

New York atop a high rise over-
looking the entire city. As they 
look around in awe, Samantha (16, 
Queens) explains that she has lived 
in New York her whole life and 
has yet to see a rooftop. The over-
arching implication of this state-
ment demonstrates how shows 
like “Project Runway: Junior” 
give young talent opportunities 
to get ahead that they may not get 
otherwise. We soon learn that the 
magnificent rooftop view is the 
inspiration for their first challenge 
in which they must construct a 

garment inspired by the city itself. 
Gunn’s declaration that he expects 
the designers to be “fearless” and 
“untethered” sets the tone for how 
audiences are meant to perceive 
the designers going forward. 

Gunn’s awe for the young 

designers mirrors our own as we 
watch them navigate the over-
whelming amount of fabric and 
supplies at Mood with just $200 
to begin conceptualizing their first 
challenge pieces. Full of heart, the 
young designers don’t shy away 
from designs that may be difficult 
to execute in limited time and with 
minimal experience. Amazingly, 
with Gunn’s expertise, the con-
testants pull off designs that much 
older, more experienced designers 
could only dream of creating; and 
in doing so, blow away the judges. 
 

Maya’s uncanny replication of 

the Manhattan skyline using strips 
of leather on her perfectly tailored 
jumpsuit negate her initial appre-
hension over being the youngest 
and least experienced designer. 
However, her youth is charmingly 
entertaining when Gunn gives her 
a vocab lesson on the word “disin-
clined,” when she is unsure wheth-
er he is admiring or criticizing her 
garment before the runway show. 
Samantha’s simple, but bold denim 
pant and crop top exude NYC

street style, standing out among 
the strongest pieces. When it came 
time for the runway show, I found it 
difficult not to get as excited as the 
designers themselves, seeing what 
they have accomplished coming 
down the runway. 

Despite the reputation of judges 

like Zac Posen and Nina Garcia 
from “Project Runway: Junior” ’s 
parent show “Project Runway” to 
tear apart designers in a manner 
typical of the cutthroat fashion 
industry — the panel on “Project 
Runway: Junior” is much more 
sensitive to their contestants’ ages 
and limited experience. The judges, 
while maintaining an air of auster-
ity to infuse the show with dramat-
ic tension, provides the designers 
with constructive criticism intend-
ed to hone their talent and inspire 
them to surpass the stigma associ-
ated with being so young.

This is exactly the show real-

ity television needs. With the 
contestants’ endearing youthful 
exuberance and talent, combined 
with the challenging circum-
stances and drama typical of the 
hit “Project Runway” series — it’s 
difficult not to get hooked after 
the first episode.

FILM NOTEBOOK

Sir Cumberbatch in 
his prime at age 39

Newly knighted 
actor deserves all 
the success he gets

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

For The Daily

To all you Cumberbitches 

out there who think Benedict 
Cumberbatch 
will 
one 

day rule the world: you’re 
definitely 
onto 
something. 

Queen Elizabeth II recently 
appointed 
him 
Commander 

of the Most Excellent Order 
of the British Empire for his 
flawless acting and charitable 
efforts. This prestigious title 
is only one step down from 
Knight status. At this point, he 
might as well be listed as “Sir 
Benedict Cumberbatch” in the 
end credits of the upcoming 
“Dr. Strange.”

While he has had an estab-

lished presence in British films 
since 2002, he only recently 
started dominating the Ameri-
can film industry. Domestic 
moviegoers received their first 
taste of him in “War Horse,” 
where he portrays the harsh 
Major Jamie Stewart. Cumber-

batch then extended his cruelty 
to outer space when he played 
Khan, 
the 
evil 
genetically-

modified creature who tries to 
destroy San Francisco in “Star 
Trek: Into Darkness.” Although 
his roles are significant in 
both these movies, Cumber-
batch still didn’t get what he 
deserved — the lead — until he 
perfectly captured the essence 
of the impeccably intelligent 
Alan Turing in “The Imitation 
Game.”

Ultimately, 
what 
makes 

Cumberbatch 
an 
incredible 

actor is his ability to fully 
immerse himself into every 
role. Unlike Christoph Waltz’s 
lackluster villain performance 
in “Spectre,” Cumberbatch is 
rarely ever questioned about his 
characters’s credibility; there 
isn’t a second of “The Imitation 
Game” when we doubt Turing 
can crack German enigma. Along 

the same lines, Cumberbatch 
can evoke emotions in even 
the most stoic person. As he 
physically collapses and sobs 
in Knightley’s arms at the end 
of “The Imitation Game,” every 
person in the audience started 
searching for the tissue buried 
deep in their purse.

However, 
he’s 
not 
only 

known for his acting anymore. 
Over the years, Cumberbatch 
has been involved with 20 
different organizations, such 
as research funds, anti-war 
campaigns and charities, but 
he has devoted most of his 
efforts to The Prince’s Trust, 
which assists homeless and 
mentally ill 13- to 30-year-
olds through counseling and 
monetary donations. He even 
encourages 
fans 
to 
donate 

to the organization on his 
birthday instead of sending him 
cards and gifts.

Benedict 
Cumberbatch 
is 

very much in his prime at the 
age of 39. With his charming 
personality, undeniable talent 
and, lest we forget, admiration 
from Her Majesty, he’s well on 
his way to earning the title of 
“World Leader Sir Benedict 
Cumberbatch.”

Or, maybe not. The idea 

that audiences should go to 
cultural events — concerts, 
exhibitions, readings — to be 
passively 
enlightened, 
quiet 

and stationary, is an invention 
of the past 150 years. Compare 
the above scene to accounts of 
Franz Liszt’s recitals, a pianist 
who “revolutionized the art of 
performance ... Everything we 
recognize about the modern 
piano recital – think Keith Jar-
rett, Glenn Gould, Tori Amos, 
or Elton John — Liszt did first. 
Even the name ‘recital’ was his 
invention.” This same article 
recounts some of the most 
striking visuals of the moment 
in class music history called 
“Lisztomania”:

“Liszt was tearing up the 

polite salons and concert halls 
of Europe with his virtuoso 
performances. Women would 
literally attack him: tear bits of 
his clothing, fight over broken 
piano strings and locks of his 
shoulder length hair,” the NPR 
staff said.

All this might seem just a 

fragment of a “simpler time.” It 
should be underlined, though, 
that the recital was caught up 
in the process of racial and class 
segregation that accompanied 
the emergence of our models of 
receiving and enjoying culture. 
In 19th century New York City, 
the movement to institute bas-
tions of culture — museums, 
concert halls and the like — to 
exclude workers, black Ameri-
cans and immigrants culminat-
ed into the Astor Place Riots of 
1849, the most violent episode 
in New York history. What is 
taken for granted today took 
decades of state repression to 
accomplish.

This history survives now in 

certain conventions and pro-
hibitions, which concertgoers 

abide by: Don’t clap between 
movements! Don’t cough! An 
upcoming performance with 
Leif Ove Andsnes, Norwegian 
concert pianist and chamber 
musician, on Friday, Nov. 20 
at Hill Auditorium, will be 
no exception. He is one of the 
powerhouses of contemporary 
classical music whose North 
American tour stands as his 
first major stint in solo perfor-
mance after a multi-year-long 
project playing and record-
ing all five piano concerti by 
Beethoven.

Yet, for a winner of “Best 

Recording of the Year” from 
BBC Music Magazine and the 
German Critics’ Award, what 
jumps out from Andsnes’s biog-
raphy is his commitment to 
unpretentiousness in his per-
formance career. In 2005, when 
the power went out at his recit-
al in Rome, he offered to con-
tinue with the performance in 
the dark. “The hall declined the 
offer ... citing safety concerns,” 
notes a biographical document 
about the pianist from his man-
agement.

“What I really dislike some-

how is the feeling when you 
come into a concert hall and 
you have the kind of people 
who really know how it’s sup-
posed to go, and they cough 
in between all the movements 
because then you are allowed 
to do that,” Andsnes said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily.

“If Beethoven, in his time, 

saw that people weren’t clap-
ping after his first movement 
of a piano concerto, he would 
have thought, ‘What the heck 
is going on?’” Andsnes said. 
“He would have thought that 
no audience was there. I mean, 
they would always clap and 
they would clap, even, after a 
great cadenza.”

Andsnes remarked that he 

has “nothing against” people 
taking the break after the first 

movement of a piano concerto 
to clap. At the same time, he 
doesn’t want to take away from 
the beauty of the silence that 
reigns over concert halls “that 
is so rare in today’s society.”

Andsnes takes great joy as a 

performer in frustrating expec-
tations about program selec-
tion as well. The program for 
his 
upcoming 
performance, 

jumping from short pieces by 
Sibelius to a piano sonata by 
Beethoven, forms creative con-
nections between what some 
purists might deem an unlikely 
pairing.

“I’ve always loved making 

recital programs to combine 
music that people will think, 
‘Ah, I know this, this is famil-
iar territory,’ with music that 
is very unfamiliar and also see 
how one can affect the other 
one,” Andsnes said.

Andsnes has also served as 

co-director of the Risør Festi-
val of Chamber music in Risør, 
Norway, a historic shipping and 
fishing town that attracts many 
tourists. 
Andsnes 
described 

how he has developed some of 
the most lasting musical rela-
tionships through these events 
over the past 20 or so years.

Holding this festival out-

side of the major metropolises 
of the world is yet another 
indication of Andsnes’s com-
mitment to working within, 
but also sometimes against, 
conventions of classical music 
performance. A prohibition on 
clapping between movements 
is not equivalent to the violence 
that laid the basis for so many of 
our dominant cultural institu-
tions. It exemplifies an aware-
ness of history that is essential 
when we participate in this con-
sumption and of how we think 
through the norms that define 
the experience of art. Andsnes 
is, besides his virtuosity, an 
exceptionally thoughtful per-
former who takes these ques-
tions seriously.

s I write this column, Shia 
Labeouf has just finished 
his #ALLMYMOVIES 

event, during which he watched 
every one of his films over a three-
day period. 
There was no 
explanation 
as to why he 
undertook 
such a cause. I 
do not under-
stand this 
man — I very 
much want to. 
 

Labeouf 

(alternate 
spelling: 
Labeef) 
is 
perhaps 
the 

greatest enigma of a human 
being. 
He’s 
chameleonic 
but 

obvious, masterful yet simple, 
unpretentious yet completely in 
your face. I just can’t get a read on 
him.

Gone are the days of “Even 

Stevens” 
and 
“Holes,” 
which 

starred an unassuming Shia when 
he was young, meek and, dare I 
say, innocent: “Shia La-weak,” one 
might say. Gone, too, are the days of 
straightforward performance: the 
animated surfing penguins film, 
“Surfs Up,” the Hitchcock-inspired 
“Disturbia” or the feel-good sports 
film “The Greatest Game Ever 
Played.” Even in “Transformers,” 
Shia seems at ease — if not in his 
element, then at least comfortable 
enough to deliver a performance 
that is … direct.

Today’s 
Shia 
is 
something 

different — not an actor but a 
perpetual performer, living and 
breathing his act. I suppose you 
could call it “performance art,” 
but that doesn’t quite capture what 
Shia is doing. But, then again, what 
exactly is Shia doing?

I must admit, for the longest 

time, I detested Shia Labeouf. 
I despised his confused face 
that 
stares 
perpetually 
into 

nothingness. I reviled the movies 
he chose to take part in, only to 
deliver an insipid, uninspired 
performance of the lowest caliber. 
I abhorred his apparent inability 
to deliver a line or to complete a 
sentence without stuttering, as if 
it meant he was “acting.” I loathed 
his ego off-screen, which oozed 
superiority.

But to my Shia-surprise, I have 

seen the error of my ways.

I 
realize 
that 
Shia 
is 
a 

philosophical mind, a thinker that 
has taken the Hollywood image 
and exaggerated it far beyond its 
traditional scope, cruising past 
parody into almost scientific case 
study. He pushes the limits of fame 
to see just what he can get away 

with, to see when people finally 
call out his antics. The funny thing 
is, the more he pushes, the more I 
am drawn to him.

It began when Shi-Guy created 

a short film that he plagiarized out 
of a comic, and then he apologized 
with a public letter that was also 
plagiarized (which in a way is 
genius; he opted to subvert a 
two-wrongs-don’t-make-a-right 
premise and transform it into a 
weapon of public aggravation). 
Then came the “I’m not famous 
anymore” paper bag he wore to 
the premiere of “Nymphomaniac.” 
Then he took on #IAMSORRY, an 
event where participants could 
enter a vestibule and interact with 
a silent paper-bag-clad Shia in any 
way they chose. 

That last enterprise was an 

interesting 
one 
indeed. 
Mr. 

Labeouf expected to be harassed 
by his visitors, but, he said that 
many simply comforted him about 
his fall from grace (or ascension 
to nirvana; it’s in the eyes of the 
beholder). But he also claims, and 
others confirm, that a woman 
sexually assaulted him during 
the event; but if you read his 
explanation of it, he’s so casual, not 
hurt or damaged, just — for lack 
of a better phrase — bummed out. 
Which raises so many questions:

If Shia halted his performance 

to prevent such an assault, would 
that mean his performance was a 
failure? Does the fact that such a 
detestable act occurred constitute 
a failure in and of itself? Or does 
it elevate the performance into 
something intangible: a real-time 
experience of the tragic artist, 
intimately 
in-tune 
with 
real 

human suffering? And these don’t 
even begin to prod the legal and 
ethical ramifications.

It’s so easy to write off celebrity 

antics as “stunts” or “machinations 
of an unsound mind.” Not to 
say that all such antics are 
performance, but certainly these 
are far more than antics — a series 
of 
interconnected 
statements 

meant to illuminate some kind 
of truth: call it the Shia-ning. But 
what is that truth?

It seems to me that Shia wants 

to tap into something paradoxical: 
expression 
through 
isolation 

and openness concurrently. It 
creates an internal conflict — it 
creates pain. And from that pain, 
by simply putting himself within 
these bizarre situations, Shia 
creates art … or else complete and 
total bullshit. There’s no script 
to guide him, no director to offer 
advice. There’s only a mind and 
a will to achieve a perfect artistic 
manifestation of human emotion, 

whether it be dejection, depression, 
damnation … or he’s a slighted, self-
absorbed professional bullshitter. 
It ultimately doesn’t matter: Shia 
doesn’t care — he just does it.

I wanted to give something 

back to him to show I recognized 
the insanity and the clarity within 
that insanity. I couldn’t be there 
to watch #ALLMYMOVIES, but 
I could watch at least one on my 
own — one I had never seen before, 
one of his worst reviewed movies 
ever.

“Charlie Countryman” is a 

trip: it drags, it makes zero sense, 
it’s dull, it’s generally awful and 
I’ll never watch it again. But 
it contains the best cinematic 
performance from Shia I’ve ever 
seen. Instead of pretention, he 
oozes absurdity that’s barely held 
together, chaos just beneath the 
surface. It comes through when 
Shia’s 
eponymous 
protagonist 

realizes that the passenger next 
to him on his transcontinental 
flight has died; he asks the flight 
attendant for help, “My hands! 
Listen! I need a wet nap!” as he 
squirms in his seat. It comes 
through when he downs several 
painkillers and hallucinates that 
the dead passenger speaks to him. 
Charlie stares, bug-eyed, slightly 
crossed, his face is as calm as it is 
manic. It comes through in the 
most tortured smile in the history 
of smiles. It comes through when 
he drops acid (which Shia actually 
took) with Rupert Grint (who 
plays an aspiring porn star who 
takes six Viagra, in case you were 
interested). And it comes through 
when Charlie, in a state of utter 
euphoria, runs through the streets 
of Bucharest, only to be hit head on 
by a taxi.

That’s a pretty apt metaphor 

for actual artist Shia Labeouf. 
The world will kick him around, 
but he’ll just get back up — the 
breathing embodiment of that 
Chumbawumba song. The world 
is his oyster; he can do anything. I 
don’t know what he’ll do next, but 
it will be worth watching.

The fact is, I’ve never seen a 

public figure so aware of his place 
in the spotlight and so willing to 
stretch the limits of that spotlight — 
someone so endowed with a sense 
of humor about his relationship 
with the public, as a celebrity and 
as a performer. You’ve done it, Shi-
Guy; you’ve won me over. I’ll follow 
you anywhere — except another 
viewing of “Charlie Countryman.”

STYLE NOTEBOOK
‘IRIS’ doc follows 
iconic fashionista

Iris Apfel still 
vibrant in new 
documentary

By CARLY COLONNESE

Daily Arts Writer

“IRIS” is a documentary 

about Iris Apfel, a 93-year-
old fashion icon and style 
chameleon. The film opens with 
Apfel telling us how she dresses 
herself on a daily basis. While 
dressed in mix-match prints 
and donning an abundance 
of 
bracelets, 
Iris 
pointedly 

proclaims, “I like individuality 
— it’s so lost these days, so 
much sameness … I hate it … 
whatever.” Directed by 88-year-
old 
Albert 
Maysles 
(“Grey 

Gardens”), this documentary 
aspires to tell the extravagant 
life, ceaseless creativity and 
style inspiration of Iris Apfel.

Apfel was born in 1921 in 

Queens, New York to business-
oriented 
parents. 
Her 
dad 

owned a glass and mirror 
business, and her mother ran 
a fashion boutique. Inspired 
by the likes of her parents, 
and after marrying Carl Apfel, 
the couple launched a textile 
business, Old World Weavers. 
Century-old fabrics served as 
inspiration for the intricately 
vintage-esque styles created by 
the Apfels. The couple retired in 
1992 and sold the textile firm to 
Stark, which now sells carpets, 
rugs, fabrics and furnishings.

Iris’s phone rings, showing 

that despite her old age, she 
stays busy. She undertakes 
many 
activities, 
such 
as 

dressing women at the local 
Loehmann’s, 
talking 
to 

students from the Fashion 
Institute 
of 
Design 
& 

Merchandising and dressing 
her husband Carl in a studded 
snapback in Florida.

Old 
World 
Weavers 
and 

the 
travel-heavy 
lifestyle 

transcended 
not 
only 
her 

career, but also her style. 
Cultural pieces from around 
the 
world, 
bright 
colors 

and loud prints continue to 
inspire Iris on a daily basis. 
She is seen throughout the 
entire documentary wearing 
extravagant 
outfits, 
full 
of 

color, rare furs, jeweled in 
armfuls of bracelets and heavily 
layered necklaces, all topped off 
with her iconic thick circular 
glasses. Iris’ vast wardrobe — 
accumulated 
from 
thrifting, 

bargaining and gifting from 
top designers — takes up nearly 
two rooms in her Manhattan 
apartment. 

As someone who tends to 

shy away from colors and find 
aesthetic as being the most 
important, I can’t relate or see 
myself wearing what Iris does, 
but I wholeheartedly respect 
her. It takes a certain coolness 
and skill to dress the way she 
does. Though at first glance 
Iris’s style is an overwhelming 
abundance 
of 
color 
and 

prints, her style is something 
completely her own. Yes, Iris 
may be in her 90s, but her style 
has recently taken a dive into 
mainstream 
society 
because 

individuality 
stands 
valued 

in fashion — and Iris’s style is 
definitely all about uniqueness. 
It takes more than just clothes 
to be stylish; most important is 
confidence.

Due to her fame in the 

fashion world and recognizable 
style, 
Iris’s 
wardrobe 
has 

been displayed in numerous 
museums in fantastical ways. 
Her art exhibition has stood in 
New York City’s Metropolitan 
Museum of Art; Roslyn, New 
York’s Nassau County Museum, 
West 
Palm 
Beach’s 
Norton 

Museum of Art and Salem’s 
Peabody Essex Museum (where 
Iris has donated nearly 600 
pieces from her wardrobe). 
These shows take a worldly 
approach 
to 
Iris’s 
exotic 

fashion sense by situating the 
mannequins dressed in her 
clothing in various settings 
from around the world. My 

favorite display was at the Met, 
where curators put all animal-
print-inspired pieces in one area 
among a plastic tiger wearing 
the Iris-signature glasses.

The 
documentary 
makes 

particular note of the Apfels’ 
ailing health. Personally, I was 
under the impression that the 
movie would purely be about 
fashion and her unique style. 
However, during filming, Iris 
had hip surgery, and Carl was 
in and out of the hospital. The 
couple is slowly selling and 
giving away some of their 
prized possessions and clothing 
items accumulated during their 
world travels. The ever-present 
notion of death isn’t uncalled 
for, as Carl Apfel died shortly 
after the documentary was 
released, a couple days shy of 
what would have been his 101st 
birthday. 

“IRIS” brings forth a more 

personal look into the life of 
Iris Apfel. Although she is most 
known for her eccentric style 
and fashion choices, to which 
the documentary pays adequate 
tribute to, the film shows that 
Iris is a quick-witted, well-
traveled and intelligent woman 
whose creativity has inspired 
countless people. In today’s 
society where beautiful, young 
models are plastered all over 
billboards and magazines, it’s 
important to remember that 
fashion and style have no age 
limit. At 93, despite the ever-
present health issues in her life, 
Iris Apfel is just as hip, stylish 
and unique as any top model 
today.

“Grandma, such big eyes you have!”

Irvin works way back from injury

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

After spending two months 

rehabbing from a back procedure, 
Zak Irvin finally seemed ready 
for game action. Even if he wasn’t, 
the list of factors preventing the 
junior forward from seeing the 
floor wasn’t supposed to include 
LaVall Jordan’s fingers.

But 
in 
an 
accident 

thematically 
consistent 
with 

the Wolverines’ injury-plagued 
2014-15 campaign, the Michigan 
assistant coach took Irvin out of 
commission for a brief moment in 
a recent practice by inadvertently 
poking him in the eye.

“He was in the locker room 

again with sort of a closed 
eye,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “It’s been a rough thing 
for him.”

In the end, Irvin escaped 

the incident unscathed, and 
returned to the court Monday 
night in the Wolverines’ 88-68 
win over Elon.

The comeback couldn’t have 

come at a better time.

With 
a 
matchup 
against 

Xavier looming, then a trip to 
the Bahamas that features games 
against No. 19 Connecticut and 
potentially Syracuse and No. 10 
Gonzaga, the Wolverines can’t 
afford to continue playing a 
12-man rotation. Irvin’s return 
to form, if it happens quickly, 
could only help bring the image 

of 
the 
starting 
lineup 
into 

sharper focus.

Without Irvin, little was clear 

for the Wolverines, who haven’t 
established any semblance of 
a consistent rotation. If Irvin 
is capable of giving Michigan 
quality minutes at the ‘3’ or ‘4’ 
positions, the roles of swingmen 
like redshirt sophomore Duncan 
Robinson 
and 
sophomore 

Aubrey Dawkins become more 
defined. The same is true for 

power-forward 
types 
like 

redshirt freshman D.J. Wilson 
and 
sophomore 
Kameron 

Chatman.

Beilein left the decision about 

a timetable for first appearing in 
game action up to Irvin.

“He came to me (Saturday) 

and said he wanted to play,” 
Beilein said. “I said, ‘Sleep on it. 
First thing on Sunday, when we 
start practice, tell me whether 
you’re going to play.’ ”

Irvin 
stuck 
with 
his 

initial 
decision, 
but 
was 

underwhelming on offense in his 
return, shooting 0-for-5 from the 
field in 15 minutes played.

The shooting woes were of 

no concern to Beilein, who said 
he’s using different criteria to 
evaluate 
the 
sharpshooting 

junior as he works to make up for 
lost time.

“Our defense changed the 

minute he walked into that 

game,” Beilein said. “I’m not, 
anymore, measuring him by 
whether he made 3s. I want to 
measure him by his defense, 
by his passing, all those things. 
Him, as a shooter? That will all 
come. I thought his shot looked 
great. It just didn’t go in.”

Irvin said he fought nerves 

initially, but felt comfortable 
once he checked into the game 
with 11:42 remaining in the first 
half.

“(I felt) a little rusty out 

there,” he said. “I was trying to 
do other things on the defensive 
end, trying to just share the ball 
out there (on offense). I know the 
shot will come.”

As is the case with senior 

guard Spike Albrecht, Irvin’s 
return is more a matter of fitness 
and comfort than it is physical 
limitation.

“Obviously, I’ve got to get back 

in game shape,” Irvin said. “I’m 
excited to get back out there 
Friday (against Xavier).”

While 
Irvin’s 
presence 
is 

invaluable, 
the 
Wolverines 

are faced with the difficult 
task of folding him back into 
their rotation against quality 
opposition, having missed an 
opportunity to do so in the three 
early-season blowouts.

Nonetheless, the change is 

a welcome one, even for the 
players who likely benefited 
from his absence and limitations. 
Robinson, for instance, scored 19 
points in 18 minutes on Monday, 
and he played 18 minutes in an 
exhibition against Le Moyne and 
15 in the season opener against 
Northern Michigan.

“It’s great to have him out 

there,” Robinson said. “He’s 
one of the best communicators 
we have. … He’s been practicing 
for a while, so just seeing him 
back out there has been good. 
I wouldn’t see any negatives in 
that.”

Wolverines’ depth allows 
key players room for error

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

At the end of the first half of 

Sunday’s game against Detroit, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team turned around its initially 
lackluster offense to go up 49-27 
by halftime.

Sophomore guard Katelynn 

Flaherty helped initiate a 30-11 
run in the second quarter by 
knocking down a jumper less 
than a minute into the frame to 
put the Wolverines up seven. But 
that was her last basket of the 
game, as Flaherty finished the 
game with just 10 points.

It was undoubtedly an off 

game for Flaherty, normally a 
star. She failed to make a single 
shot during the second half 
and was called for her fourth 
foul midway through the third 
quarter. Her mid-range shots 
continued to be blocked, which 
occasionally caused a turnover, 
and even her open shots at the 
top of the key weren’t falling 
right.

This wasn’t the Flaherty that 

Michigan was used to, but it 
survived despite her 4-for-13 
shooting. The Wolverines sailed 
to a 28-point victory over Detroit 
with 12 players chipping in at 
least one point.

“I think the strength of our 

team, and you could see it today, 
is (that) you have your best player 
arguably in Katelynn Flaherty 
(who) has an off day, and we still 
score 88 points,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico after the 
victory.

Added senior guard Madison 

Ristovski: “I don’t think that 
we are a team made up of one 
particular person that’s gonna 

make or break us winning or 
losing. (Everyone on this) team 
brings something to the game 
and has their own roles, and if 
one person is down, someone else 
is stepping up.”

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

their lineup has enough depth 
to not rely on Flaherty to hit 
3-pointers. They can look to 
some of the newcomers, even, to 
take over the game. Freshman 
forward 
Hallie 
Thome 
took 

the bulk of Michigan’s scoring 
with 21 points, and some of 
her classmates made strides 
alongside her.

Freshman 
guard 
Boogie 

Brozoski had a quick turnaround 
from Saturday to Sunday, going 
from one assist and six turnovers 
to one turnover and six assists. 
On top of Brozoski’s seven points 
Sunday, freshman forward Sam 
Trammel added eight of her own, 
making an immediate impact 
off the bench and proving that 
Barnes Arico has options to fall 
back on. 

“Sam came in off the bench 

after probably sitting for 45 
minutes and dove for a loose 
ball at halfcourt,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We need to be willing to 
do those things. We need to sell 
out, to buy in, to get on the floor 
to scrap and claw, because every 
possession is important.”

In 
keeping 
with 
the 

importance 
of 
possession, 

Michigan made each one count 
by relying on strong defense-to-
offense transition, which allowed 
just a few seconds to tick off the 
shot clock.

According to Ristovski, it’s the 

Wolverines’ greatest strength, 
and they prefer not to take it slow 
to set up a play — even if they can. 

Michigan’s transitional offense, 
alongside a breadth of skill 
coming off the bench, allowed 
the Wolverines to take over and 
go on multiple runs, including 
the explosive 8-0 run within the 
first three minutes of the second 
quarter.

But that’s not to say Michigan 

has no room for improvement. 
Against Detroit, the transition 
was much cleaner than Saturday’s 
outing against Binghamton, when 
the Wolverines made numerous 
passing errors off the fast break. 
Barnes Arico said improvements 
— such as handling the ball 
properly — would fall in place 
as players get more comfortable 
together.

“(Our transition offense) is 

definitely going to get better,” 
Barnes Arico said. “When you 
play fast like that, sometimes 
you have the tendency to be 
a little loose with the ball, so 
that’s something we’re going to 
emphasize this week at practice 
— valuing each possession.”

Aside from the transition, 

Michigan 
also 
flexed 
its 

rebounding muscle. Utilizing the 
depth of its roster, four different 
players, two of whom were 
guards, contributed six rebounds 
each to out-rebound Detroit, 
53-23. 

The prerequisite of being a 

guard for Barnes Arico is the 
ability to rebound the basketball 
and to be scrappy under the 
basket. It’s another component 
of how deep Michigan’s roster is, 
and makes the rest of the season 
look promising.

So even if a player isn’t on 

top of her game, the Wolverines 
shouldn’t fret. They can just look 
to someone else to do the job.

Rudock praised 
for composure

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

With 2:52 left in regulation 
of the Michigan football team’s 
game at Indiana on Saturday, 
fifth-year 
senior 
quarterback 
Jake Rudock had to lead one of 
his biggest drives as a Wolverine.
Michigan set up at its own 34, 
down by seven. Rudock quickly 
led his team down the field: an 
in route to junior tight end Jake 
Butt for 16 yards, an out route to 
Butt for nine more. Two plays 
later, he found redshirt junior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson for 
41 yards to the Indiana two-yard 
line.
But 
then, 
the Wolverines 
began to let 
time tick off 
the 
clock, 
putting 
pressure 
on 
Rudock. 
The 
crowd ramped 
up 
to 
the 
loudest it had been all day, and 
the students crowded into the 
first few rows of their section. If 
Rudock didn’t lead Michigan into 
the end zone, they would rush 
the field to celebrate Indiana’s 
first win in the series since 1987. 
The quarterback entered the 
huddle to call the play.
“He was the exact same he was 
the entire game,” said fifth-year 
senior center Graham Glasgow. 
“He literally was the exact same. 
He came out to the huddle, made 
eye contact with us and didn’t 
really say anything besides the 
play call. I had a feeling we were 
going to complete the pass and be 
good to go.”
The fans stayed put. After 

three rushing plays stalled inside 
the five-yard line, Rudock calmly 
took the snap and delivered a 
touchdown throw to Chesson 
with two seconds left.
After 
the 
game, 
Rudock 
maintained the same even keel. 
He avoided getting too high 
after the win, just as he avoided 
getting too low after a season-
opening loss to Utah in which he 
threw three interceptions.
“He’s 
very 
mature,” 
said 
redshirt junior offensive lineman 
Erik Magnuson. “He’s played a 
lot of games. He’s had ups and 
downs, but the biggest thing is 
he’s consistent. If he throws an 
interception 
or he throws 
a touchdown, 
he’s the same 
guy. He’s not 
going to melt 
down 
or 
all 
that type of 
stuff.”
It 
was 
that kind of 
quarterback, 
an 
experienced 
two-year starter at Iowa, whom 
the Wolverines knew they were 
getting when they recruited 
him as a graduate transfer this 
summer. After mixed results 
earlier in the season, Rudock has 
proved to be a capable leader of 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh’s 
offense.
“Myself, I look at him and 
go, ‘I gotta be more like Jake,’ 
” Harbaugh said. “It’s working 
really well for him. (I’ll) see if I 
can’t incorporate that into my 
own game, my own personality.”
Harbaugh entrusted Rudock 
with the keys to the offense in his 
first season in part because of his 
leadership. In Rudock’s opinion, 

a quarterback doesn’t have to be 
a big “rah-rah guy” to be a leader. 
Rudock prefers to talk with a small 
group individually and make sure 
they’re on the same page.
“It’s nice to have that type of 
guy leading the team, instead of 
somebody who comes into the 
huddle screaming, or somebody 
who seems like he needs to be 
screamed at,” Glasgow said.
Rudock, his teammates say, is 
the same way off the field. At 22, 
he’s one of the oldest members of 
the team, though his personality 
makes him seem much older in 
the eyes of his teammates. He 
doesn’t normally frequent bars 
or parties after games, preferring 
instead to stay in. He isn’t much 
for social media, which puzzles 
the other players.
He has already graduated from 
Iowa and hopes to attend medical 
school one day, finding helpful 
resources at Michigan’s hospital 
and master’s program to that end.
Soon after he arrived this 
summer, his persona earned 
him a nickname from the other 
quarterbacks: 
“Dad.” 
Rudock 
said he doesn’t mind it, though 
not everyone joins in.
“No, I don’t call him Dad!” 
Glasgow said. “I’m older than 
him!”
The other quarterbacks, on 
the other hand, stand in stark 
contrast to Rudock.
“The QBs are kind of like 
‘Mean Girls,’ ” Glasgow said. 
“They talk about girls and stuff, 
and gossip.”
Rudock doesn’t take part.
“He 
doesn’t 
want 
to 
be 
bothered with that, you know?” 
Glasgow said. “He’s just all 
business all the time, and that’s 
what I like.”

“The QBs are 
kind of like 
‘Mean Girls.’ ”

Clark improves at new position

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Jim 
Harbaugh 
asked 
his 
team a question during its first 
meeting of the week Monday.
On the surface, it was a simple 
one. But within the context 
of a long season nearing its 
conclusion, it was not.
“He looked at us and he asked 
us if we were tired as a whole 
team,” 
said 
redshirt 
junior 
cornerback Jeremy Clark.
The players had reason to say 
yes, mentally and physically. 
They have been dealt their 
share of injuries, the most 
recent being the loss of redshirt 
junior defensive tackle Ryan 
Glasgow’s pectoral injury. They 
have also had to combat the 
mental stress that comes with 
three out of their last four games 
being decided on the final play. 
The latest rendition, Saturday’s 
win against Indiana, took two 
overtimes.
Still, they were resolute in 
their answer.
“We all said, ‘No,’ ” Clark 
said. “And then he said, ‘All right 
then.’ ”
According to Clark, Harbaugh 
believes much of the fatigue is 
mental and can be cured with a 
positive attitude. Still, Michigan 
is taking measures to reduce the 
fatigue and wear and tear that 
comes with the late stages of a 
football season.
Though Clark agreed the 
Wolverines do have a bounce 
in their step, as Harbaugh said 
Monday, 
players 
are 
taking 
fewer snaps in practice for 
preservation purposes.
The 
fatigue 
was 
evident 
at times during against the 
Hoosiers, 
when 
Indiana’s 
up-tempo 
offense 
gashed 
Michigan’s defense to the tune 
of 527 yards. The performance 
was not a pretty one.
The 
wear 
and 
tear 
also 
extended to Michigan’s special 
teams 
unit. 
Special 
teams 
coordinator 
John 
Baxter 
diagnosed Indiana’s punt return 
touchdown in the third quarter 
as the result of having tired 
bodies on the unit.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
be 
extended a reprieve Saturday 
against Penn State. The Nittany 
Lions’ offense operates much 
slower than Indiana’s. While 
the Hoosiers run 80.8 plays 
per game, Penn State runs 
66.1, the fewest in the Big 
Ten. Michigan’s offense is in 
between, running 70.3 plays per 
game.
“We were trying to get the 
three-and-outs so fast and stay 
off the field,” Clark said of the 
game against Indiana. “But 
once we weren’t getting them, 
you could just see the pace was 
taking its toll on us.”
Clark, in his first year as a 
cornerback, has had the added 
task of working across from 
junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 
Lewis. 
Though 
Lewis 
has 
developed a reputation as a 
shut-down 
defender, 
playing 
alongside him presents its own 

challenges.
As the season has progressed, 
Clark 
has 
felt 
as 
though 
opponents have shied away from 
targeting Lewis, a semifinalist 
for 
the 
Bednarik 
Award, 
awarded to the top defensive 
player in college football.
According to Pro Football 
Focus, 
Lewis 
has 
been 
the 
fourth-most 
targeted 
cornerback in college football 
this season. Still, Clark thinks 
teams have become more aware 
of Lewis’ prowess and have 
been 
throwing 
Clark’s 
way 
more frequently.
“When you try the other side, 
you’ve got Jourdan Lewis over 
there, so you’re pretty much not 
going to get anything, so I don’t 
blame the teams for trying,” 
Clark said.
Clark believes the key to 
ensuring he’s not beat on deep 
balls 
when 
opponents 
are 

consistently targeting him is 
staying with receivers on the 
line of scrimmage. Last year, 
when Clark played safety, he was 
already deep in the secondary 
from the start of the play, so 
there was less to do in terms of 
tracking the ball and staying 
with receivers from the line of 
scrimmage.
With two games left in the 
regular season, Clark finally 
feels as though the game has 
slowed down at the new position. 
Earlier in the season, he would 
sometimes lose track of his man 
at the line of scrimmage and 
panic would set in.
“Everything 
just 
starts 
racing,” Clark said. “I’m trying 
to just stay calm.”
At least, if his answer to 
Harbaugh’s 
question 
at 
the 
beginning of the week was true, 
he won’t be tired if that situation 
arises Saturday.

‘M’ prepares for loud 
crowd at Penn State

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

As the Michigan football team 
prepares for its toughest road 
environment of the season, the 
Wolverines are getting used to 
not being able to hear.
Penn State’s Beaver Stadium 
is the nation’s second-largest 
college football stadium behind 
only Michigan Stadium. It seats 
106,572 people.
And with hoards of Nittany 
Lions fans ready to scream their 
lungs out when the Wolverines 
visit State College on Saturday, 
Michigan is bracing for the noise 
using two differing approaches: 
incessant music and complete 
silence.
“Whenever we play away 
games, we’ll always practice 
with music on,” said redshirt 
junior guard Erik Magnuson. 
“There will be speakers all 
throughout the field, and it will 
be really loud and you won’t be 
able to hear anything. And then 
if we’re not doing that, we’ll try 
to eliminate talking. Take out 
the sound … nobody can talk, or 
the quarterback only whispers, 
stuff like that. (We) try to 
practice without being able to 
hear.”
Saturday’s matchup has major 
Big Ten East title implications, 
as the Wolverines can keep their 
conference championship hopes 
alive with a win.
But after scares in its past two 
road contests — a three-point 
win at Minnesota and a double-
overtime 
victory 
at 
Indiana 
— it’s crucial that Michigan is 
better prepared for a nasty road 
environment this week.
“We struggled a little bit 
last 
week,” 
Magnuson 
said. 
“Atmosphere was a little bit more 
than we were expecting. We 

didn’t expect it to be that loud, 
so it got to us at times. We had 
to adjust throughout the game, 
going to a silent cadence, stuff 
like that.”
With a “white out” crowd 
looming at Penn State, the 
atmosphere is only going to get 
more hostile.
So far this year, the Wolverines 
have posted a 3-1 road record 
with a plus-31 point differential. 
But that number is buoyed by a 
28-0 win at Maryland, a game 
in which Michigan won in a 
blowout without looking its best.
Every 
other 
game 
has 
been close, dating back to the 
Wolverines’ season opener at 
Utah, which the Utes won, 24-17.
“I think we’ve come a long 
way,” Magnuson said. “That was 
a hard game to start the season 
off with, tough place to play. But 
I think we’ve improved a lot. 
Jake’s gotten a lot better, been 
really consistent. The last two 

games were career highs for him, 
but I think everyone’s getting 
better the whole year.”
And 
while 
Magnuson 
acknowledged how loud the 
stadium would be on Saturday, 
he also put it into perspective.
“All loud stadiums are the 
same,” Magnuson said. “(If) you 
can’t hear, you can’t hear. There’s 
no difference.”
With their Big Ten East 
destiny largely in their own 
hands, the Wolverines don’t need 
to win pretty on Saturday.
Like their wins over the 
Hoosiers and Golden Gophers, 
an ugly victory still gets the job 
done. But that doesn’t mean 
Magnuson wouldn’t appreciate 
a chance to make the Nittany 
Lions’ loud crowd go quiet.
“I like playing in front of our 
crowd better, but it’s fun going 
into a hostile environment,” 
Magnuson said. “Kind of being, 
like, the bad guys.”

Freshmen ready 
for road challenge

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

It was Oct. 23, and Messa 
Rink 
erupted 
in 
shouts 
of 
discouragement and boos of 
disapproval as the Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 
lineup 
was 
announced. Wooden bleachers 
were packed with Union faithful, 
all united in their hostility 
toward that night’s villain: the 
Wolverines.
For Michigan, the voyage to 
upstate New York was its first 
road trip of the season.
For the freshmen, it was their 
first trip to enemy territory in 
their collegiate careers.
Now 
seven 
games 
into 
the 
season, 
the 
12th-ranked 
Wolverines — and specifically 
their freshmen — are tasked with 
stealing two wins from No. 11 
Boston University on away ice, in 
an environment that will likely 
make the reception at Union look 
like a warm welcome.
Though some would expect 
road-game jitters, Michigan’s 
young talent is embracing the 
obstacle ahead of them with 
enthusiasm.
“Sometimes it’s good to be the 
bad guy,” said freshman forward 
Cooper Marody. “You just have to 
embrace it. When they’re booing, 
and they’re silent when you score, 
you kind of shut them up. So it’s 
good for us to go on the road and 
win games, and we like doing it.”
The 
young 
Wolverines’ 
eagerness to face top opponents 
away from home stems slightly 
from their experience in Union’s 
intimidating rink, but primarily 
from their respective paths that 
led them to Michigan.
Marody, 
Cecconi 
and 
freshman forward Kyle Connor 
all spent time in the United States 
Hockey League. As they traveled 
to different venues in small cities 
such as Dubuque and Sioux Falls, 
they encountered hotbeds of 
passionate fans who would pound 
on the glass.
Freshman 
defenseman 

Nicholas Boka and freshman 
forward Brendan Warren, on the 
other hand, had experience that 
prepared them even more for the 
clash with the Terriers.
As members of the United 
States 
National 
Team 
Development 
Program, 
the 
duo had the opportunity to 
scrimmage college teams — one 
of which was Boston University 
just last year.
While their collegiate and 
junior 
league 
experience 
in 
hostile 
environments 
can’t 
compare 
to 
the 
6,150-seat 
Agganis Arena they will face 
on Saturday, the freshmen feel 
capable of continuing to make an 
impact against ranked opponents.
Connor and Marody lead the 
team in scoring with nine points 
each, while Warren trails the 
duo with eight points. The trio 
is playing well on both ends of 
the ice too, as they are all plus-3 
through seven games.
In the defensive zone, Cecconi 
and Boka have played every game 
for the Wolverines, earning praise 
from 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach Werenski for the physicality 
they brought to the ice.
To have success against the 
Terriers, Michigan will need 
its freshmen to play without 
intimidation and replicate the 
success they have had through 
seven games.
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
is confident that his rookies can 
rise to the occasion.
“I think they will (perform at 
the same level they have been),” 
Berenson said. “I think they feel 
part of the team, and they just 
play hard like we do every night, 
no matter who we play against. 
But the freshmen don’t seem to be 
fazed by anything.”
Agganis Arena will be a sea 
of red and white on Friday, but 
don’t expect the freshmen to be 
shaken up or to shrink under the 
pressure. The Wolverines will 
look forward to being the villains 
in what could be their biggest 
game of the year.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY NOVEMBER 18, 2015

Wednesday, November 18, 2015 // The Statement

T

he phrase “orgasm tsunami” gets thrown 

around a lot nowadays. More than it 

used to. Why, back in the ‘70s, they 

didn’t even have tsunamis. And God didn’t 

invent the orgasm until 1993 (the year Alex was 

conceived).

But lately, it’s like everybody’s trapped in 

a frenzy of sick, wet ecstasy, collapsing onto 

beds, hammocks, and gas station bathroom 

floors, rolling over to their sex lover, heaving 

out, “Wow. Oh wow. I mean, wow. Philip. You 

changed me.”

So imagine Alex’s surprise when he returned 

home one night, drunk on cheap, lead-based 

wine, to discover his penis not literally flailing 

about like a loose garden hose, swinging around 

like some kind of epileptic snake.

(Editor’s Note: Penis joke required. If exclud-

ed, writer’s pay will be deducted from $4 to 

damp salmon tail.)

The boy was surprised to be single, funny 

as he was. Example: What did the entomolo-

gist’s wife say to her husband when his bug was 

depressed? Your fly is down. Right? Where shall 

he toss your bra?

So he got Tinder (because he hadn’t used 

enough protection).

At 2 a.m., Alex checked his phone. There was 

a text. From a girl. A girl girl. A Tinder girl girl. 

We’ll call her, “Bartleby the Scrivener.” Asking if 

Alex wanted to hang out. He said, “Yes,” and 

started applying moisturizer.

Now, we know what you’re thinking. “Nyah. 

Tinder’s trashy. It’s only for garbage people. 

Where’s my meat cleaver? Nyah!” You disgust 

us, Sharon.

Alex scurried around the room, doing push-

ups to inflate his 15-year-old boy pecs, spraying 

“Smells of Rain and Life” Febreze, squirting his 

Walgreens cologne and flicking on the mood 

lighting: a lamp. The boy would’ve been less 

nervous if he was someone other than himself. 

For example, a crab.

At 2:15 a.m., Bartleby the Scrivener arrived, 

saluted, and slid past Alex’s “Hey there,” before 

offering a bottle of gin and whispering to the 

empty apartment she was, “really high oops.” 

The girl had brown curls, heavy eyes — weighed 

down by this and that and a man-boy named 

“Trev” — and a forehead mole like a red sniper 

dot.

She splayed over the couch and smacked her 

lips, the hem of her crop-top sliding up and up, 

all the way to Heaven-knows-where and then 

some. Her bra peaked out and waved at him. He 

waved back, then stopped and darted his eyes 

back and forth.

His wristwatch ticked.

When the boy tried to speak, he felt like a 

9-year-old on top of another 9-year-old inside a 

trench coat, playing at adult like, “That so, Her-

man?” or “Well, ma’am, I think you have a lovely 

bust.” Or like what he actually said, which was: 

“Gin then?”

He poured it all between two glasses. It 

smelled like his uncle.

He handed her a glass and clicked “Shuffle” 

on Spotify.

Oh, she may be weary

...

Wearing that same old, shaggy dress, yeah 

yeah

(Otis Redding Sex Noise)

Try a little tenderness.

The Scrivener sipped her drink and stroked 

her bumblebee tattoo. God, how he wanted to be 

that bee. Be that bee. God how he would be that 

bee. Buzz.

Alex took a long swig of gin (90% Gin. 9% 

Coke. 1% Leftover Puberty).

Alex: “I like your tattoo.”

Scriv: “I actually have ten. I just got a new one 

too.”

Alex: “Oh yeah? Where’s that?”

Scriv: “Somewhere. Maybe you’ll get to see it 

later.”

Alex: “Oh — wow. That’s the best thing any-

one’s ever said to me.”

A few minutes later, Bartleby scoffed about 

men, and Alex said:

“No, no I hate men, generally, I mean, like, 

95% of men are terrible, so like just be decent, 

just be basically decent and, and you’re golden, 

you know?”

He tasted his sweat and waited.

Bartleby laughed. “It’s a really good thing 

you’re funny.”

The carbonated gasoline drip, drip, dripped 

onto his tongue, and the taste wasn’t wholly 

unsweet. It’s a really good thing you’re funny.

“Oh,” he said. “Yes, it is ... is a good thing. I’m 

really lucky. Because the rest of me is such shit.”

Bartleby protested, “No that’s not what I 

meant, it’s not an insult,” but Alex said, “No, it’s 

OK. I know what you meant, it’s fine,” and they 

were better for his saying so, but also because 

they would both die one day and wanted to see 

the other naked in the meantime.

The two went on like that for a while, swap-

ping nonsense and drinking gin. Well, him 

drinking his gin. Her not drinking her gin then 

offering him her gin, then him ... drinking her 

gin.

And then, it was getting to be about that 

time, the night bleeding through the blinds like 

smoke and the gin concussing him and she was 

still high and beautiful and dry as all Hell, and 

neither noticed the lamp light dim or the moon 

run low or the way the boy was so awful and 

would be terrible to kiss and even worse to dry 

hump.

And then, his brain went off, alarmed, ring-

ing and ringing. And what do you do when your 

brain’s got an idea and it won’t shut up about the 

thing? What do you do?

Alex got up, forgot himself, and kissed her. 

On the lips. Bullseye.

And she kissed back, just so perfectly too, 

wet and full.

And the song changed:

The next thirty minutes are ad-free,

Thanks to the following sponsor ...

But they didn’t stop.
The next morning, the smell of desper-

ation and potato skins swam in the space, 
and something else, something like the 
deep end, dangerous and significant and 
unsafe for underage rabbits like they 
were, and she laughed about what-was-it.

And I turned to her, to all of them, you 

know, when they laughed, and I asked, 
“What’s so funny?” And they giggled and 
whispered, “Nothing. You’re funny.” And 
I nodded, nodded, nodded, and thanked 
God I was.

If Alex’s column makes you forget about 

death, email him at adbnard@umich.edu. 
He needs to be distracted too.

Another Thing: I got so kissed

My Cultural Currency: The Talk

I

s the sex talk a thing? Because 
movies, TV shows, and books 
have told me that this is a com-

mon parenting practice, but I’ve 
personally never experienced it.

Growing up, sex was never a topic 

that was discussed to any extent in 
my house. My father, with his quiet 
and reserved demeanor, and my 
mother, with her anxiety-prone 
personality, would rather die than 
mention anything remotely having 
to do with sex to my siblings and I.

Sex was always alluded to 

through verbal smoke and mirrors.

When I turned twelve, I think 

my mom attempted to give me some 
version of the talk? I had asked her if 
I could sleep over at a friend’s place 
and had received a firm no.

“Look, Tanya, you’re a girl,” she 

said, noting a fact I had known my 
entire life.

“So?” I asked.
“There are certain things that 

girls have to be careful about,” she 
said.

“OK, like what?”
“There are just some things that 

we can’t do, because of safety.”

“What does this have anything to 

do with going to my friend’s house 
for a sleepover?”

“Go play outside and let me cut 

the vegetables,” she said, as she cut 
up the cucumber more quickly and 
aggressively than before.

Last year, for my story on the 

SAAN conference, I had the oppor-
tunity to interview comedian Hari 
Kondabolu. When I asked him what 
the most challenging part of his set 
was that day, he said when he would 
talk about sex, he could feel some 
tightness and discomfort from the 
older Indians in the audience.

Sex isn’t something that’s amiss 

from Indian culture. It’s a part of 
our religious mythology and now, 
there’s an upward trend of open dis-
cussion and positivity toward sex in 
Indian society.

However, most diaspora Indians 

generations back from mine were 
raised in a household where sex was 
a taboo topic and have, unfortunate-
ly, carried that idea with them.

In fact, for the longest time in 

Indian cinema, seeing two people 
kiss on screen was a rare occur-
rence. It’s why we have so many 
song-dance sequences in our mov-
ies — that’s our answer to the on-
screen kiss.

Once, when I was ten and my 

brother was seven, we were watch-
ing a movie that I can’t remember 
the title of and snacking on a giant, 
family-sized bowl of popcorn.

Things were getting good in the 

movie, I remember, because the 
main couple was professing their 
love, the music was swelling in the 
background, my brother was yelling 

about it being a “stupid, girly movie” 
and everyone in the room was 
becoming hyperaware of each other.

The camera zoomed in on the 

couple’s faces, which were moving 
closer and closer together, when 
suddenly my mom lunged for the 
remote on the opposite end of the 
couch and popcorn flew in my face.

“SKIP FORWARD, JIGNESH,” 

she yelled at my dad.

My father, alarmed and horri-

fied by the idea of my young eyes 
witnessing two people kiss, fum-
bled with the remote and skipped 
forward so hastily, that the DVD 
popped out of the player because it 
thought we had finished watching 
the movie.

Neither of my parents wanted to 

risk skipping backward to find the 
exact spot we could resume watch-
ing, so we just went to bed and, to 
this day, I’m not entirely sure if 
things ended up OK in the movie.

Most of the sex education I 

received for much of my life was a 
combination of public school man-
dated-ed, Judy Blume novels, and 
the Internet. Unlike the movies and 
TV shows I watched with them, my 
parents never thought to censor the 
ones I watched or the books I read 
alone.

I could check out anything I 

wanted from the library and my 
parents wouldn’t bat an eyelash 

or even take an inter-
est in what I was reading. 
In their minds, reading 
books means gaining more 
knowledge. Tanya likes 
books. So, by transitive 
property, Tanya is gaining 
more knowledge.

And most of the time, 

they were exactly right. 
Most of what I was reading 
wasn’t explicit material, 
but rather classic literature. 
But sometimes, like when 
Judy Blume’s “Wifey” and 
“Forever,” slipped into my 
11-year-old hands, I wished 
they had kept a little bit 
more of a close eye.

Here’s to hoping my 

parents don’t read this col-
umn.

“Every morning when I walk to work,” he 
says, “I walk by this big oak tree and I nudge 
it a little bit, trying to establish some camara-
derie.”

For the past sixty-four years, Abernathy 

has watched Ann Arbor grow up. New lay-
ers of asphalt, an ever-expanding university, 
and 24-hour Speedways have transformed 
the once sleepy village into a bustling city. 
Born into an agricultural society, Abernathy 
observes this progression with reserved dis-
taste. He remembers the Great Depression, 
the Dust Bowl, his family’s “meager exis-
tence” on a cattle ranch in southeastern Okla-
homa: mornings plowing corn with a mule, 
rabbits, and bread for dinner, nights playing in 
his grandfather’s blacksmith shop, and eigh-
teen years without electricity. He has little 
patience for city life.

Yet Abernathy has a certain affection, a 

curious gratitude, for the lively Ann Arbor. 

“I believe those who live here live in the 

upper one-billionth of the world,” he says.

Perhaps J.T. Abernathy, a WWII veteran, 

world-renowned potter, and soft-spoken 
scholar, now considers himself among the 
world’s upper one-billionth. He has a Bach-
elor of Fine Arts degree in ceramics and an 
Master of Fine Arts degree in kiln-building 
from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloom-

field Hills. He has worked alongside famed 
potters, and his art is featured in thirty muse-
ums around the world— Tokyo, Amsterdam, 
Toronto, and all across the United States. And 
he’s routinely viewed as an Ann Arbor legend.

Abernathy continues his walk, the four 

o’clock darkness allowing him to mistake the 
City of Ann Arbor for a simpler Village of Ann 
Arbor, circa 1951. He is immensely grateful. 
Grateful for the Potters Guild where he works, 
grateful for belonging among the group of art-
ists who work there. But more than anything, 
he is grateful for being able to perceive beauty. 

“Whenever I’m lost,” he says, “I go for a 

walk, and look.”

He picks up a leaf, crushed under the har-

ried feet of nine-to-five workers, marveling 
at its resilient structure, its color, its propor-
tions. He cannot see detail, he says, but he 
doesn’t need to — Abernathy simply absorbs 
beauty. Stopping on the corner of Hill Street, 
he stares at the lines: telephone wires and 
wood-paneled fences and the angled, rust red 
roof of Fingerle Lumber. 

“You can see the various planes, and if you 

squint at it,” he says, pausing, “you can see 
depth and you can see basic design.” 

Pausing at the base of an old pine tree, he 

observes the trunk’s architecture, the pine’s 
sturdy framework— “It all makes sense,” he 

says matter-of-factly. “The way the damn 
thing sits in the earth … I may be blind, but 
God I can see.”

Abernathy now unlocks the Potters Guild’s 

front door, recently painted a cheerful teal 
to liven the building’s unassuming facade. 
For three hours, he removes himself from 
the city’s fluorescent street lights and steps 
inside the clay-covered, glaze-coated world of 
ceramics.

The Guild is the quintessential artist’s 

workshop. Plastic yogurt cups line the coun-
ters, each filled with kitchen utensils and 
dental instruments — rusted butter knives, 
wooden mixing spoons and tooth scalers, all 
caked in dried clay. A Hellmann’s Real May-
onnaise jar is sealed to preserve some murky 
ingredient. And a Lipari bottle, once full of 
crushed red peppers, now holds two inches 
of a wine-colored liquid. Glaze ingredients — 
titanium dioxide, tin oxide, black iron oxide 
— sit in half-gallon jugs, and sample glaze 
tiles cover the walls like paint swatches, each 
numbered in an elaborate inventorying sys-
tem. Shelves are stacked floor-to-ceiling with 
unfired stoneware, unglazed bisqueware, and 
unsold vessels; vases, bowls, plates, mugs, 
sculptures and the occasional ceramic wood-
land creature await their debut at the Guild’s 
upcoming winter sale.

Abernathy navigates the Potters Guild’s 

ceramic maze with the effortlessness of a 
founding member. Traces of the morning’s 
newly made batch of clay hide under his fin-
gernails, cling to his faded blue jeans, and 
speckle his black loafers, as if seeking com-
panionship with the artist: Abernathy the 
Creator. Creator he is, having built the Guild’s 
first kiln, its bricks eroded and pipes char-
coaled from fifty years of constant use. 

“I design machines for fun like some people 

play music,” he says. “I’m not lacking in imagi-
nation.”

Unbeknownst to his colleagues, he stores 

his finished work in a “secret spot”: a small 
hut out back where brave potters conquer the 
flames of raku glazing. There, Abernathy’s 
traditional and experimental art collide: his 
meticulously crafted vases in matte blacks 
and silvery whites sit beside a pair of abstract 
masks, whose pastel oranges and blues form 
subtle lips, chins, and eyes. A rough slab of 
clay, doused in primary colors, stands behind 
his stoneware pots, whimsically painted with 
cobalt blue brushwork. He points to an egg-
white pot, a little misshapen, perhaps on pur-
pose— “I like them sometimes when they look 
like they’ve just been dug up.”

The Simple Life of the 
Almost Famous

By Kristina Perkins, Daily Staff Photographer

J.T. Abernathy rises before the sun each morning. By four o’clock 
he has cooked a plain breakfast, cleaned last night’s dishes and 

scrubbed his teeth — carefully placing a tweed wool cap on his head 
before stepping outside. Walking to work, the 92-year-old is not in 
a hurry. He lingers, allowing his curious eyes to ponder the bashful 
color of mid-October leaves, the clean planes that emerge from the 

star-lit horizon, the depth of the Ann Arbor skyline.

Personal Statement: Spotify and modern honesty

by Amelia Zak, Daily Music Editor

I 

recently argued with a friend who was frustrated with 
my Spotify etiquette.

“You listen to my playlist all the time but you don’t 

follow it?” he asked, irritated.

“Yes,” I responded, amused.
This set off his berating: “There’s no honesty left on this 

godforsaken planet. No one practices it anymore. I recently 
realized that I needed to be more honest. We all should 
work to be more honest.”

“What does this have to do with my Spotify activity?” I 

retorted.

“It has everything to do with it,” he responded.
And he’s right.
I had just thought of Spotify as another outlet for my 

obsessive music exploration. I had thought of it selfishly, 
too. It was a way for other people to dote and admire the 
numerous playlists I had made and music I had found. There 
is a Spotify hierarchy, and I was to acquire a title within it.

Pondering about, and consequently writing about, these 

thoughts was a therapeutic experience for me. Following the 
realization that I a) spend too much time on the application 
and b) should probably find some other topics to marinate on 
on a day-to-day basis, I realized that my friend’s correlation 
between the two topics (Spotify and honesty in modern 
times) did, in fact, have everything to do with one another.

Of the various music streaming apps and websites, Spotify 

is the most popular, and the most widely used. Whatever 
your music taste, there is a function on the app that will 
satisfy you. Party time playlists, rainy day songs, fresh R&B, 
that new single from Justin Bieber — it’s accessible to all 
interested.

Spotify is also the music streaming site with the most 

interconnectivity. You can view on a play-by-play basis 

what others are listening to. By clicking on another person’s 
profile you can access all the music they have collected 
and playlists they follow since joining the site. You can 
view what others have “Starred.” You can view what they 
categorize as “Hungover” songs. Most Millennials have a 
pretty comprehensive “’90s Throwbacks” playlist, too. 

The social media aspects within Spotify are fun and 

engaging in most situations. I love seeing what my friends 
are listening to. I love sharing new songs I’ve found. I 
love creating new playlists with people. I love stalking the 
profiles of people I know (and people I don’t) to admire and 
investigate what they are listening to. In those moments, 
usually at 1 a.m. when I still haven’t finished my reading for 
tomorrow, I’ll lie in bed and admire their personal musical 
anthology. I’ll add songs from their playlists to my own.

Songs are just songs for some. By this, I mean to imply 

that not all will emotionally attach themselves to the music 
they listen to.

But most people I know are.
The “most people” I know choose the music they listen 

to because of the way that it makes them feel. That feeling 
is unusual and subjective. They’re searching for something 
sonic to match their happiness, sadness, or anxiety. They are 
searching for a song to match something they themselves 
don’t understand. These “most people” look for the beats, 
the trumpet sounds, the lyrics or the guitar plucks that 
locate something within themselves they couldn’t define 
before.

It will fulfill some insatiable thirst for grandeur. It’s the 

magic of “most people.” The lovelorn look to it for respite. 
The cynics look to music as a backboard of their inner 
frustrations and self-deprecations. The happy use it to 
remain happy. The depressed use it to remain depressed. It’s 

kryptonite, it’s an antidote: it’s magic.

So why do you we ignore the intimacy of Spotify? Do I 

stand alone as an individual who loves to know about the 
listening decisions of the people I know? Are there few 
people who wonder how one’s listening decisions correlate 
with the current conditions of their existence? Why is my 
friend Maura listening to so much Bruce Springsteen? Is 
she feeling nostalgic? Does she miss home? Why is John 
listening to so much Adele? Is he sad? Is she helping him 
through some rut?

Music listening isn’t always intimate, but it surely can be. 

And when it is intimate, or when what we are listening to is 
too revealing or embarrassing, we have the option to resort 
to a “Private Session.” We can hide what we’re going through 
from the people who follow us. We can examine that pretty 
girl or boy’s playlists, searching for music compatibility. We 
can listen to Britney Spear’s seminal classic, “Lucky,” fifteen 
times on repeat without judgement or forced justification. 
We don’t have to be honest. Just like Facebook, Twitter, 
Instagram, and the like, Spotify allows us to form some sort 
of facade. We can create a fake reality for the outside world 
to see, and hide the true reality within ourselves. We don’t 
have to be honest.

Honesty in our modern age is difficult to achieve. With so 

many options for deceptions, and with so many intangible 
barriers, we are constantly given the option of dishonesty. 
And with this, the magic of music dissipates ever so slowly. 
As easily as it can be shared, it can be hidden. We don’t have 
to be as honest. We can pretend.

And so I decided to follow my friend’s playlist last night. 

Does that mean anything at all? Probably not. Will anyone 
else see the bravery or intimacy in that? No. Because it 
doesn’t require much of either.

Personal Statement: A reunion

by Alex Intner, Daily Arts Writer

W

hen my sister saw me through the entryway 
to my apartment building, she jumped up and 
down with a smile beaming across her face. 

Once I opened the door, there was nothing stopping her 
from running into my arms, saying “Hi,” with more joy 
than I’ve heard from her voice in a long time. She was in 
Michigan visiting for the weekend, and we were together 
again for the first time in a few months.

Every time we’re reunited after a long time away, 

there’s a moment like that one, and it happens more often 
since I started school. The University is 500 miles from 
home, so my sister and I are separated for most of the 
year. It was a big change for us, as the past couple years 
are the first time that we’ve spent significant time apart. 
Without divulging too many of my sister’s personal 
struggles, I will say that my sister has faced challenges 
which have caused her to need accommodations 
throughout her life. But this separation is the biggest 
challenge we’ve faced as siblings.

During this reunion, you’d have been hard-pressed 

to see my sister separated from my side. After lots of 
talk about giving her an unofficial tour of campus, we 
were finally walking around. A look of wonder never 
left her face. She was taking everything in, watching the 
students who were going about their Friday afternoons. 
She looked in awe at the Angell Hall columns, 
uncomfortable as we worked our way through the 
Shapiro library and the crowd of stressed students, and 
smiled as I pointed out the Diag we were walking on was 

the same one she saw on ESPN a couple of weeks earlier.

I think the distance is tougher on her than it is on 

me, so I’ve worked hard to make sure we never drift too 
far apart. Weekly Facetime calls with home always end 
with a few minutes of the two of us privately chatting. 
Usually there’s not much to these, as she will tell me a 
couple details about her school week and I’ll tell her a 
couple details about mine. For us, the little details are 
the most important; they allow us to catch up and never 
drop the conversation that would happen if I was home.

I was worried about taking my sister into the Big 

House. She’s been to professional sports games before, 
but 2013 New York Mets crowds were not nearly as big 
nor as loud as what she faced in the stadium. Still, she 
was excited for the experience. She was a cheerleader for 
her school’s basketball team, so she pumped herself up. 
I could feel her nerves as she walked into the imposing 
building with the massive scoreboards she’s only seen 
from afar. Once we reached our seats, an overwhelmed 
look never left her face. She never cried, remaining stoic 
for the entire first half, but she didn’t cheer like she 
planned. She clapped for a couple Michigan touchdowns, 
but she never looked comfortable in the stadium.

During days like our trip to the stadium, I try to 

reassure her. I’m her older brother; it’s my job to be 
there when she needs me. So, I went into full comfort-
mode during the game, holding her hand, making sure 
she never got too overwhelmed by the situation. Even 
if I used the word “job,” this never feels like work. I’ve 

done this for my entire life, and I’m going to continue 
for the rest.

My sister makes this easy because of her kind heart. 

I try to emulate the way she treats the people she loves 
with every day. There’s no one I’d rather go to when 
something is going wrong in my life and I need comfort. 
Even though she might not understand the situation, 
she knows what I need is a hug and a reassuring smile. 
She wants the people she loves to be happy, and she will 
use all the kindness she has to make that happen.

Every day when she gets home from school, she walks 

in the door, shouts “boo,” and waits until I respond. I 
don’t completely remember when or how this tradition 
started, probably a result of me hiding and surprising 
her when she got home, but it’s now a tradition. No 
matter how tough a day either of us had, we always find 
room for this.

I miss little moments like this the most when I’m at 

school. When I’m away, there aren’t the little bits that 
built our connection over the years. Yet, every text she 
sends, whether it’s about something funny she watched 
on “Ellen” or where my family went to dinner, is signed 
“Love. Ann.” This message tells me one thing: even 
if there’s 500 miles between us, the connection isn’t 
broken and the love is still there.

When we had our first moment alone since my sister 

arrived in Ann Arbor, she looked at me and she said “I 
missed you, big brother. I’m glad I’m here.”

“Me too, Ann,” I responded, “me too.”

Abernathy’s work is dynamic, per-

petually in flux, driven by his insa-
tiable curiosity. He calls himself a 
“classicist,” but uses the term loosely. 
“Some of the stuff I’m doing now is 
definitely not classic,” Abernathy says 
with a grin. “I was taught by a lady who 
was Swedish, I was fascinated with 
Oriental ceramics, and I lace all that 
into production and engineering— I’m 
a hodgepodge of information.” Deft 
and seasoned, he can finish a piece in 
four hours: bisqued, fired and glazed.

Abernathy began throwing pots he 

was 23, his previous experience with 
art no more than drawing comics as a 
child. “After about an hour of my first 
pottery class, I went up to my teacher 
and said that I was going to be a pot-
ter. She said, ‘Oh my god you’ll starve 
to death!’ She was right.”

Abernathy laughs to himself in a 

series of gentle chuckles; crow’s feet 
gather around his green eyes. His thin 
frame is agile, but his gait is contem-
plative — each movement is calculated, 
every gesture purposeful. He com-
pares himself to a wood-fired glaze: 
“It develops age in the kiln,” he says, 
thoughtfully. “It’s been around for 
so long, it has claimed its place in the 
world.”

J.T. Abernathy has likewise claimed 

his place in the world. “I’m almost 
famous,” he says, “but getting rid of the 
almost is very, very hard work.”

The sun now strides across the sky, 

announcing the October morning’s 
opening scene. Alarm clocks ring, 
beep, buzz, and gurgle with NPR’s 
Morning Edition. Ann Arbor sheds its 
covers, ties its shoelaces and opens the 
doors to its hybrid cars.

J.T. Abernathy begins his walk back 

home, stopping to observe the texture 
of the bark on a nearby maple tree.

“I’m simply fascinated by the joy of 

being alive.”

Thought Bubble

“I lost my father a couple of years back. I was the last person to have a conversation with him. He was moving rocks 

around the front yard. When I asked him what he was doing, he said, ‘Moving big rocks.’ 

“Since then, that’s been my driving thing. I wake up every morning and I want to move big rocks. Not only for myself, 

but for other people.

“I’ve unfortunately dealt with more than just one close death in the past. I believe in the last interaction you have with 
them as being a guiding thing. I believe in a creating being, reasoning of life. I don’t want to just see my dad going, I 

like to see that he gave me some closure.”
