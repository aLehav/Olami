Burmese activist
Aung San Suu Kyi
accepted award
via Skype
By BEN SEIDMAN
For the Daily
Despite being halfway around
the world, a Nobel Prize winner
personally accepted an award
from the University last night.

Aung San Suu Kyi - a Bur-
mese nonviolence activist and
1991 recipient of the Nobel Peace
Prize - accepted the Raoul
Wallenberg Medal for humani-
tarianism via telecommunica-
tion and Skype. More than 500
people watched her accept the
award in Rackham Auditorium.
Suu Kyi, who currently heads
the National League for Democ-
racy in Burma, recorded a
30-minute lecture acceptingthe
award in which she spoke about
her experience as a humanitar-

ian.
"(Democracy) is not an end in
itself but the means to achieve a
particular kind of society," Suu
Kyi said in her recorded lecture.
"... The people of Burma have
made democracy their cause
because they want the freedom
to be able to help themselves."
The Wallenberg Medal is
awarded to humanitarians
whose actions on behalf of per-
secuted people represent the
efforts of Raoul Wallenberg, a
University alum who saved an

estimated 100,000 people from
Nazi execution during World
War II. Other recipients of the
medal include the-Dalai Lama,
Holocaust survivor and author
Elie Wiesel and Archbishop
Desmond Tutu. Suu Kyi is the
21st recipient of the medal.
Suu Kyi closed her lecture by
paying tribute to Wallenberg.
"To deny freedom means to
deny life," Suu Kyi said. "That is,
those who love life cry out: 'Give
me freedom or give me death."'

medical histories. But this num-
ber won't be growing anytime
soon, as UHS is in the process of
going paperless.
UHS recently began phasing
in an electronic health record
keepingsystem, to record patient
information. The new system,
which went live about a month
ago and will be fully implement-
ed in one year, is part of an effort
to remedy current communica-
tion problems with the Univer-
sity Hospital.
With the former paper sys-
tem, if a patient was tested at
UHS and then referred to the
University Hospital, the patient

nas caused commuicaton prob-
lems.
"For as long as I've been here,
we have struggled wit a way Ito
share lab reports;.isit e_6riir
extra reports without just copy-
ing them and putting them into
the patient's hand and saying,
'Please take these with you,"'
Winfield said.
Though the use of faxes to
exchange reports has helped,

often received by the clinic and

A student goes to purchase
two six-inch Subway subs and

his exclusive membership in a

everything from haircuts, to

It's not the coveted Ameri-

that's what it's designed to look

discount card called Legends-

four University students. And
while it won't give you access
to thousands of dollars, it will

make one of those two six-inch

With about 200 cards cur-

in the next few months after ITS
finishes producing the design
prototype.
After receiving a design pro-

To address the multitude
of sleeping students doz-
ing off into a post-lunch
oblivion during lecture, one
newly formed campus group
is hoping to combat sleep
deprivation.
LSA freshman Michelle
Postman, a nap aficionado,
founded the Napping Club
earlier this year. Though it's
still in the planning phase,
she said the group hopes to
begin offering scheduled
napping sessions and activi-
ties to emphasize the impor-
tance of adequate sleep.
"Itkind of started as a joke
(among my friends) because
so many college students
don't get healthy sleep," she

said.
Though the club started
informally, Postman said she
and her friends decided to
make the club official.
"We wanted to make a
group for people that loved
to nap and for healthy sleep
for college students," she
said.
Thus far, she said get-
ting the club off the ground
hasn't been easy for Post-
man, particularly in plan-
ning official events and
garnering interest. Despite
lack of awareness about the
group, the club is currently
creating T-shirts and flyers
in an effort to attract atten-
tion.

With 10 members and
counting, she said the club
will soon start holding offi-
cial meetings, in addition to
offering group-napping ses-
sions a few times a month.
once the club gains more
members, Postman added
she has various ideas for
sleep-related activities
including holding a char-
ity napping event, in which
the money raised will be
donated to sleep research on
insomnia. She also plans to
develop designated places to
nap on campus.
"(We would like) to create
a space where people could
nap in peace," Poston said.

broad plan that would make fun-
.nges to federal damental changes to the tax code
and to the nation's entitlement
tax system programs.
After weeks of calling Social

Rick Perry proposed a for reforming the program. Perry

and more aggressive than Perry also wants to make
sis Republican rivals or major changes to Medicare. His

politics of class division," gram. He would also gradually
aid. "Others simply offer raise the Medicare eligibility age
aved plans with warmed- and pay people benefits based on

their income levels.
Perry's plan sets a flat 20 per-
cent income tax rate, but also
gives taxpayers the option of
sticking with their current rate.
He would also maintain popular
deductions for families making
less than $500,000 a year and
end taxes on Social Security ben-
efits. Perry would end corporate
loopholes and lower the general
corporate tax rate to 20 percent.
Many elements of Perry's plan
are controversial - and oth-
ers have tried and failed to pass
them. President George W. Bush
tried to add private accounts to
Social Security, but the proposal
was widely condemned and did
not pass.
"I am not naive. I know this
idea will be attacked," Perry said
of the proposal. "Opposition to
this simple measure is based on a
simple supposition: that the peo-
ple are not smart enough to look
out for themselves."
President Barack Obama's
campaign immediately criticized
Perry's plan as hurtful to middle
class Americans. Perry's plan,
Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt
said, "would shift a greater share
of taxes away from large corpora-
tions and the wealthiest onto the
backs of the middle class."
The major policy rollout is a
critical part of Perry's efforts to
right a struggling campaign. It's
an opportunity to demonstrate a
heft and seriousness that wasn't
on display during recent debates.
Distracting from Perry's
speech, however, were new
comments he made question-
ing whether Obama was born in
the United States, a debunked
controversy that centered on
Obama's birth certificate.
In an interview with CNBC,
Perry said it was "fun to - to
poke" at the president on the
birth certificate issue. "I don't
have a clue about where the pres-
ident - and what this birth cer-
tificate says," Perry said. He was
defending an interview he did
with Parade magazine, when he
said he did not have a "definitive
answer" about whether Obama
was born in the United States.

Turkish rescuers remove Semiha Karaduman, the mother of Azra Karaduman, a two-week-old baby girl saved hours
earlier from under the debris and rubble of the same collapsed building in Ercis, eastern Turkey, yesterday.
Turkish infant emerges
from-- earthquake rubble


7.2-magnitude
quake kills at least
459 people
ERCIS, Turkey (AP) - After
48 hours, a miracle emerged
from the rubble: a 2-week-old
baby girl brought out half-naked
but alive from the wreckage of
an apartment building toppled
by Turkey's devastating earth-
quake.
Rescue workers erupted in
cheers and applause yesterday
at sight of the infant - and again
hours later when her mother
and grandmother were pulled
out, their survival a ray of joy on
an otherwise grim day.
The death toll from Sunday's
7.2-magnitude quake climbed to
at least 459 as desperate survi-
vors fought over aid and blocked
aid shipments. A powerful
aftershock ignited widespread
panic that turned into a prison
riot in a nearby provincial city.
With thousands of quake sur-
vivors facing a third night out in
the open in near-freezing tem-
peratures, Turkey set aside its
national pride and said it would
accept international aid offers,
even from Israel, with which it
has had strained relations.
Tuesday's dramatic rescue of

three generations of one fam-
ily was all the more remarkable
because the infant, Azra Kara-
duman, was declared healthy
after being flown to a hospital in
Ankara, the Turkish capital.
Television footage showed
rescuer Kadir Direk in an
orange jumpsuit wriggling into
a narrow slit in the pile of con-
crete and metal, then sliding
back out with Azra, clad only in
a T-shirt.
"Praise be!" someone shout-
ed. "Get out of the way!" anoth-
er yelled as the aid team and
bystanders cleared a path to a
waiting ambulance.
"Bringing them out is such
happiness. I wouldn't be happier
if they gave me tons of money,"
said rescuer Oytun Gulpinar.
The pockets of jubilation
were tempered by many more
discoveries of bodies by thou-
sands of aid workers in the
worst-hit city of Ercis and other
communities in eastern Turkey
devastated by the earthquake.
Even rescues were tinged
with sadness: 10-year-old Ser-
hat Gur was pulled alive from
the rubble of a building after
being trapped for 54 hours, only
to die a short time later at a hos-
pital, state-run TRT television
reported.
Some 2,000 buildings col-

lapsed, but the fact that the
quake hit in daytime, when
many people were out of their
homes, averted an even worse
disaster.
Close to 500 aftershocks have
rattled the area, according to
Turkey's Kandilli seismology
center. A strong one on Tuesday
sent residents rushing into the
streets in panic while sparking
a riot by prisoners in the city of
Van, 55 miles (90 kilometers)
south of Ercis. The U.S. Geolog-
ical Survey put that temblor at a
magnitude of 5.7.
Some prisoners demanded to
be let out while others set bed-
ding on fire as the revolt spread
inside the 1,000-bed prison, the
Dogan news agency reported.
Security forces surrounded
the facility to try to prevent
escapes, while military vehicles
fired water cannon at crowds
gathered outside in the streets.
There was still no power or
running water in the region,
and desperate people stopped
trucks even before they entered
Ercis, grabbing tents and other
supplies. Kanal D television
showed people fighting over
tents and blankets.
Aid workers said they were
able to find emergency housing
for only about half the thou-
sands of people who needed it.

Judge rejects
medication hearing
for Jared Loughner
A federal judge turned down
yesterday a request by lawyers
for the Tucson shooting rampage
suspect to hold a special hearing
regarding his forced medication.
U.S. District Judge Larry
Burns wrote in his ruling that
23-year-old Jared Lee Loughner
is being forced to take psycho-
tropic drugs at a Missouri prison
facility because he poses a danger
to himself
So far, the decision to medi-
cate Loughner has been made by
prison officials at the Springfield,
Mo., facility where experts are
trying to make him psychologi-
cally fit to stand trial.
Loughner's defense attorneys
had argued that the issue should
be up to a judge and wanted
Burns to consider the matter.
Loughner has pleaded not
guilty to 49 charges stemming
from the Jan. 8 shooting in Tuc-

Obama today will use his

a measure passed by Congress
that reduces the repayment cap
on student loans from 15 percent

cent. The White House wants it to
go into effect in 2012, instead of
2014. About 1.6 million borrowers
could be affected.
Also, the 5.8 million borrow-

Official: Accord
at EU summit

The official says the 10 EU
members who don't use the
euro do not want to agree to
a bank recapitalization plan
unless there's also agreement on
increasing the firepower of the
EFSF, the EU's bailout fund.
The person, speaking on con-

WALLENBERG
From Page1A
Following the viewing of her
speech, a panel of students was
invited to the stage to ask Suu
Kyi questions via Skype.
Because it was 7 a.m. in
Burma, John Godfrey, Wallen*
berg executive committee chair
and Rackham Graduate School's
assistant dean for international
education, prefaced the ques-
tion-and-answer session by tell-
ing the audience that Suu Kyi
"might still be wakingup."
As her face appeared on
the screen, the audience rose
to their feet in resounding

applause. Followingthe ovation,
Lester Monts, the University's
senior vice provost for academic
affairs, awarded Suu Kyi the
Wallenberg Medal to which she
responded with a smile.
Undergraduate and graduate
students on the panel asked Suu
Kyi questions ranging from her
inspiration as an advocate for
Burma's new constitution to the
current situation in Libya.
"Her discussion with the
students was brilliant," God-
frey said in an interview after
the event. "If anyone can bring
a message of endurance and
hope and persistence on behalf
of what is right on justice and
human rights, it is this woman."

Godfrey proceededto explain
how Suu Kyi was under house
arrest in Burma for 15 years
until 2010. She was released on
the condition that she was not to
leave the country.
"The (Wallenberg) Com-
mittee had talked about her for
years, but she had been under
house arrest and completely iso-
lated," Godfrey said. "When she
was released from house deten-
tion ... we began to think, 'Well,
she's not going to be able to leave
Burma, but is there any other
way to do it?"'
Suu Kyi is best known for her
fight for democracy and pur-
suit to ensure human rights in
Burma.

cardholders, who pay $15 for
the membership. According to
LSA freshman Nathan Pilcow-
itz, another co-founder, the
name of the business, Legends-
Card, is a reference to the title
of the new divisions in the Big
Ten Conference.
Pilcowitz, Kaufman, and
the other two co-founders LSA
junior Artur Fruman and LSA
freshman Joshua Kaufman,
Jonathan's brother, grew up
together in the West Bloom-
field and Bloomfield Hills
area. Their friendships and
shared entrepreneurial mind-
set inspired them to start the
LegendsCard business this past
summer after Fruman read an
article about a similar venture
at the University of Pennsylva-
nia.
During the summer, the four
friends got LegendsCard up
and running despite funding
and timing problems. They've
used their personal funds to
start the company, but Fruman
said managing the coding for
the website along with study-
ing has been difficult.
Pilcowitz and Joshua
Kaufman also worked at a
venture capitalist firm in Chi-
cago this summer, where their
entrepreneurial interests were
fostered. With the skills they
learned from their internships
and the firm's encouragement,
Pilcowitz said the four friends

jumped right in.
"Business plans are out,"
Fruman said. "We didn't even
come up with a business plan."
Instead of the traditional
business planning steps, Fru-
man said they produced a
one-page description on the
business and strategy. Part of
that strategy includes seven-
inch signs near cash registers
at participating businesses
informing patrons that the card
is accepted there. The students
have also used social media
to get the word out, with the
LegendsCard website and
Facebook page listing the par-
ticipating businesses.
Though LegendsCard has 34
business partners and count-
ing, it's suffered a few rejec-
tions. Amer's Mediterranean
Deli on State Street and the S3
Safe Sex Store on South Univer-
sity Avenue turned them down,
Fruman said, on the principle
that those establishments
never offer discounts.
Still, the setbacks haven't
diminished the students' moti-
vation to find more partners.
They're currently working
on signing local bars such as
Scorekeepers Bar and Grille
and Good Time Charley's, and
they have their sights set on
Revive and Bert's Caf6 as well,
Fruman said.
Fruman and Pilcowitz agree
the business is not all about
making aprofit.
"I think our main goal was to
start a business, (to) see how we
can do it," Fruman said. "The
money really definitely comes
secondary."
Jonathan Kaufman said they
make agreements not to sign

with their clients' biggest com-
petitors. For example, because
LegendsCard has partnered
with Rave Cinemas on Carpen-
ter Road, they won't attempt a,
deal with Goodrich Quality 16
Theater on Jackson Road.
Social Work student Kristen
Houck said she's never heard
of LegendsCard but would be
interested in investing in a
good discount card.
"I'm on campus a lot, and I
spend a lot of money on food,
so anything that would help
me save money in the long run
would be great," Houck said.
Ahmad Almusawi, one bf
the managers of Rendez Vous
Cafe on South University, said
he's seen a lot of customers use
the card. But Maher El-Awar,
manager of Smoka Hookah on
South University - a Legends-
Card affiliate - said the card
hasn't brought in any custom-
ers yet. But he has sold some
of the free cards he was given
- affiliates get 15 free cards to
distribute - and thinks it will
be good for business overall.
"A lot of people seem to be
talking about it," El-Awar said.
"There's a big buzz about it."
In the future, the founders
hope to expand to other uni-
versities.
"We're going to be the first
discount card to franchise to
other campuses," Pilcowitz
said.
They're also investigating
other ways of developing their
business.
"Eventually, we'll have an
app where you'll be able to
locate yourself and see all the
discounts around you," Pilcow-
itz said.

hands of a doctor. Additionally,
though UHS can see medical
reports from the hospital, the
hospital cannot see reports from
UHS.
"If you come into (UHS) with
a broken wrist at 10 o'clock on
Monday morning, and then
you're transferred to the hospital
on Tuesday night, they currently
cannot see our X-rays," Winfield
said. "And they cannot see what
we did."
According to Winfield, the
current system negatively affects
the UHS' patient care.
"This is kind of an old system
that, based on the technology we
have now, is begging to be fixed,"
he said. "We've been aware of it,
and we're absolutely certain that
(the current system) is not opti-
mal use of the funds because of
the repetition of testing and the
inconvenience for patients."
In the last few years, UHS
directors have considered a
number of providers for an elec-
tronic health record system, but
were worried the systems might
not be compatible enough with
the hospital to meet the needs of
the hospital's system. Last year,
hospital officials announced that
the hospital would employ Ethic,
an electronic health records pro-
vider.
Winfield and UHS officials
asked to be included in the
switch to the new program to
ensure quick and clear interac-
tions between the two units,
including visit documentation,
lab reports and X-rays. He said
hospital directors were receptive
to the idea, though the integra-
tion just happened recently.
Though the price has not been
finalized yet, Winfield said the
new system will likely cost about
half of UHS's allotted budget for
electronic records. Rather than
dealing directly with the elec-
tronic health record provider,
UHS is now included in the Uni-
versity Hospital's contract with
the provider and is charged a fee
from the hospital.
When the transfer is made to

the electronic system, UHS will
still refer to the paper system
for patients with complicated
health issues or treatments.
When enough of a patient's his-
tory is documented in the elec-
tronic system, the patient's paper
records will be archived.
The switch will include some
processing and infrastructure
changes for UHS. Because the
electronic system is more metic-
ulous than paper records, the
pace and flow of the clinics will
be different, and UHS might
need additional staff to operate
the clinics, Winfield said. For
example, one of the changes is
that the new system requires
UHS staff to enter information
such as drug allergies, drugs the
patient is taking and the patient's
vital signs.
Winfield added that when
UHS directors began looking for
an electronic health record pro-
vider, they altered their opera-
tions to meet the criteria of the
system rather than to custom-
ize the system to fit their cur-
rent methods. A large part of the
adjustment will be training staff
to work with the new system and
reorganizing staff to maintain
productivity.
UHS Ancillary Services
Director Gwendolyn Chivers
said the new electronic record
system will be especially helpful
in the departments she oversees,
including the pharmacy and
radiology departments. Ancil-
lary Services is already prepar-
ing for the switch by digitizing
data in the laboratory and radiol-
ogy information systems.
Though the system had some
kinks to work out - like images
not appearing in multiple places
- Chivers said the new electron-
ic system has been helpful.
"When we did not have an
electronic radiology system,
there was a gap in the continuity
of care," she said. "Now, a patient
can go anywhere in the Univer-
sity system, and for continuous
care, reports of the images are
available, and that has been a
tremendous effort but a success-
ful one."



GSRAS

are in favor of unionization.
At MSA's Oct. 11 meeting,
members of GEO spoke to the
assembly and asked for its sup-
port of GSRA unionization.
Raiman pointed out that
unionization would make
membership compulsory for all
GSRAs, requiring them to pay
$400 in annual fees. He argued
that the benefits the union
would provide either don't
apply to GSRAs - such as hours
and promotion requirements
- or are already provided by
Rackham Student Government,
like advocacy and mediation.
"(GSRAs) currently have the
right to form a union in which
membership is voluntary with
no election required," Raiman
said. "The only reasonthey need
to hold an election is to force all
GSRAs into the bargaining unit
and become the sole bargaining
agent for all GSRAs."
CENTER FOR STUDENT
INVOLVEMENT
INTRODUCED
University officials intro-
duced the creation of the Cen-

ter for Student Involvement - a
merger between the University
Unions Arts and Programs and
Student Activities and Leader-
ship - to the Michigan Student
Assembly last night.
Speaking before the assem-
bly, Susan Pile, director of the
University Unions Arts and
Programs, explained that the
two offices joined together out
of a desire to rethink student
involvement on campus.
"Part of this process was to
streamline work for students to
improve student involvement
on campus, but also to really to
enhance University Unions and
University life," Pile said.
The new center willbe divid-
ed into two teams - one focus-
ing on student organizations
and the other focusing on pro-
grams, according to SAL Assis-
tant Director Jimmy Brown,
who will lead the student orga-
nizations team in the future.
Pile said that entire staff is
trained to handle issues arising
from both teams.
"While we have these two
sort of functional areas within
the team, we've been very inten-
tional about the cross-develop-
ment of the staff so that if you
come into either of the offices,
we can be a resource across

multiple areas," Pile said.
For the time being, the center
will remain divided between
the second and fourth floors
of the Union, where SAL and
UUAP are currently located,
respectively. But officials hope
to transfer both organizations
to the second floor within the
next year.
The transition into the uni-
fied center will officially take
place on Nov. 1, Brown said.
MSA VOTES TO ALTER
OPERATING PROCEDURES
The assembly passed a reso-
lution by a margin of 25 to one
that defines speaking rights for
the community concerns por-
tion of the agenda.
The new definition lays out
a system for determining vio-
lations and associated penal-
ties for speakers. Despite the
approval of the resolution,
some assembly members had
concerns about the wording of
the resolution and two com-
munity members voiced their
disapproval.
The resolution was in
response to past incidents in
which community speakers'
comments offended members
of the assembly.

CTOOLS
From Page 1A
with the MSuite Student Collab-
orative. Bansal said the students
were motivated to design Mobile
CTools because of the popular-
ity of smart phones, and the team
wanted to create the app so stu-
dents could use CTools quickly
and easily without computer
access.
Bansal and his team also
streamlined the program by
only including the most perti-
nent CTools features for students
such as the resources, announce-
ments and assignment menus
and MPrint. Bansal said the
decision to streamline the func-
tions Mobile CTools offers will
increase efficiency and speed,
when accessing menus.
"Let's say you wanted to access
a resource. (Using the mobile
app), it would probably take you

half a minute or a minute, as
opposed to spending two minutes
trying to hack away, trying to
get your password (on a regular
mobile browser)," Bansal said.
The next step is a "dashboard"
function for the app that allows
students to view recent activ-
ity including professors' post-
ings and a calendar of upcoming
assignments and quizzes, accord-
ing to John Johnston, a senior
business systems analyst for the
teaching and learning group at
ITS.
The ITS team did a trial run of
the mobile app at the Michigan
Union on Friday and received
positive feedback, Johnston said.
"We got a very good response
back," Johnston said. "Some stu-
dents said it was easier to use than
the standard view of CTools."
When it is released, students
can access the app by download-
ing the Michigan app from an
Android or Apple market.

Cultivating new resources
'U' and businesses should utilize local farms
n general, farms are thought of as relics of the past. Many peo-
ple are unaware of how food gets to grocery stores or where
the food one eats comes from. However, federal grants allo-
cated to farm start-ups are an important step in encouraging peo-

ple to buy and eat local food.
According to an Oct. 20 Michigan Daily
article, the Food System Economic Partner-
ship, a Michigan-based nonprofit organiza-
tion, will receive nearly $92,000 in grant
money from the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture's Farmers Market Promotion Program.
The grant will beused by FSEP to supply Til-
lian Farm Development Center, a local farm
incubator program outside Ann Arbor Town-
ship, with new farming equipment to assist
Michigan-based farm start-ups.
With the assistance of the federal grant,
residents of Southeast Michigan can look
forward to more locally owned farm start-
ups. The grants will lead to the consumption
of more locally grown foods and create jobs
in the area. The University and Ann Arbor
businesses should support these start-ups
by expanding their partnerships with local
farming businesses.
Tilian will provide mentorship, finance
and business planning assistance and farm-
ing equipment for qualified individuals to
start their farms on land provided by the
incubator program. Participants of the pro-
gram who establish their farms in Michigan
will increase the amount of locally grown
foods in restaurants and markets.
People living in urban areas with little
access to fresh or healthy food options -
areas known as food deserts - will benefit as
more locally grown food becomes available.
Many residents who live in these areas don't
have easy access to transportation, but farm-
ers markets that sell fresh produce locally
provide easy access to healthy food options.
Produce stores or markets that plan to open
in these neighborhoods can also benefit from
partnerships with local farmers, who can

provide regular shipments of fresh fruit and
vegetables to fill the aisles at prices residents
can afford.
First Lady Michelle Obama - who was in
Detroit yesterday - has widely campaigned
her "Lets Move" initiative since entering the
White House. Obama is trying to decrease
obesity, particularly in children. In July, she
partnered with Wal-Mart to help open more
than 1,500 stores that would provide fresh
produce in urban areas. In Detroit and other
cities throughout Southeast Michigan, many
neighborhoods lack accessible, affordable
grocery stores. Without fresh and healthy
options, people are more susceptible to obe-
sity and other serious diseases. It is impor-
tant that residents buy healthier foods that
urban gardening and local farms provide.
A study conducted in 2006 by the Michi-
gan Land Use Institute and the C.S. Mott
Group for Sustainable Food showed that
when existing Michigan farms increase their
sales to produce stores, they generate $187
million in revenue, which can create 1,889
new jobs. With Michigan's unemployment
rate at 11.1 percent, these figures are hard to
ignore.
Locally grown food is beneficial for peo-
ple's health and the environment, as these
foods have fewer chemicals and preserva-
tives and require less fuel to transport. But
in order for start-up farms to increase and
exert their economic, environmental and
health benefits, farmers participating in
incubator programs like Tilian must stay in
Michigan. For this to occur, local businesses
and the University need to expand their rela-
tionships with sustainable, local agriculture
businesses.

ast week, Commander in
Chief Barack Obama helped
strategize the killing of yet
another big-time
major enemy
leader, Libyan x
dictator Moam-
mar Gadhafi.
This achieve- '
ment liber-
ates the Libyan
peoplefrom DAR-WEI

fisted rule and CHEN

safer.
ForObama, Gadhafi'sdemiseisthe
fourth-major foreign policy triumph:
Besides Gadhafihe successfullyused
a drone attack to kill al Qaeda leader
Anwar al-Awlaki in late September
and he recently announced the Iraq
war would be over by the end of the
year (a campaign promise). And in
a memorable moment this summer,
Obama presided over a covert opera-
tion into Pakistan that led to the
death of Osama bin Laden.
Even with these accomplish-
ments, Obama is still in trouble
for 2012. Commander in Chief is
not his full-time job - he is Presi-
dent Obama too. So far, Obama has
achieved mixed economic results. A
USA Today article last year found
that his stimulus plan, according to
economists, created nearly 3 million
jobs and averted "what could have
been called Great Depression 2.0."
However, the country's unemploy-
ment rate has remained at an unac-
ceptable 9 percent minimum for
almost his entire presidency.
Fair or not, Republicans are going
to slam Obama's economic policies
in an effort to win the 2012 presi-
dential election. However, they will

have ahard time tarnishing his ster-
ling foreign policy record, which
brings up an interesting point: The
juxtaposition of Obama's achieve-
ments in foreign policy and the econ-
omy is somewhat puzzling. How can
someone be so efficient and ruthless
on one front and, at times, be frus-
tratinglyineffective on another?The
GOP will try to explain this through
its core message: Obama has failed
on the economy because he is "in
over his head," in the words of House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor. But
what if another reason existed that
explains Obama's economic woes?
Obama has to work with Congress
to pass legislation. As you might
know, Congress includes people
called Republicans, who are united
with one goal. Cutting down the
national debt? Not according to their
massive tax cuts for the wealthy
and corporations. Advancing the
nation's economy with conservative
solutions? Maybe, but not their top
goal. According to Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell, "the sin-
gle most important thing we want to
achieve is for President Obama to be
a one-term president."
Contrast Obama's predicament
on the economy with what he deals
with when he becomes Command-
er in Chief Obama. Obama can get
deeply involved in the armed forces
and - short of declaring war - can
do almost whatever he wants in
regards to military policy. Repub-
licans cannot do little to stop him
beyond press attacks - admittedly,
one of the few things they do well.
Obama's performances on the
economy and foreign affairs are
more explainable now. When the
GOP purposely tries to bring down
his presidency through intran-
sigence and obstruction, Obama

Gadhafi's death is
another triumph
for Obama.
lus was watered down with ineffec-
tive tax cuts and scaled back aid to
local and state governments. Want
to guess which party championed
the tax cuts and reduced govern-
ment aid? Conservatives might say
that perhaps Obama hasn't per-
formed well on the economy because
economics is not his strong suit
- nothing to do with obstruction.
However, duringhis daysworkingas
a community organizer, Obama spe-
cifically sought out struggling fami-
lies to understand their problems.
If anything, he should have better
ideas about helping those in need
than handling foreign affairs.
When Obama answers to him-
self, he is a dominant force. This
statement is not to say that he has
been ineffective when working
with Congress (a simple Google
search brings up a litany of accom-
plishments) - the point is that
when Obama is not hamstrung by a
radicalized GOP, he has been pret-
ty damn good. Maybe all America
needs is a shot of pure Obama.

would like. For example, Obama's

economists including Nobel Prize

University Dining Services has been
increasing its sustainable initiatives and mak-
ing those initiatives.more visible to students
by purchasing a greater percentage of locally
grown food, increasing composting efforts
and also going trayless (Dining halls going
trayless, 10/12/2011). I applaud the efforts and
agree that the programs will provide success-
ful results, but the solutions taken up by Din-
ing Services appear to only be topical in an
inherently unsustainable system.
The structure of the University's food sys-
tem is the most pertinent in regards to its sus-
tainability; itccan't rely on patch over programs
as a means to an end. Energy use and food
waste are the outliers in the University Dining
Services. Imagine nine industrial kitchens in
University dininghalls preparing thousands of
meals everyday, without the kitchens knowing
exactly how many students will show up for
those meals. I know calculations help deter-
mine numbers and portions, but overproduc-
tion is the only way to ensure availability and
satisfaction of consumers.
I've worked in several kitchens over many
summers and know firsthand just how unsus-
tainable the food industry is. Restaurants
end up spending about 4 percent of revenue
on utilities, equivalent to about two-thirds of
their roughly 6 percent profit. (The approxi-
mately 88 percent remaining is spent on the
cost of food, salaries, etc. according to a 2006-
2007 National Restaurant Association report)
Restaurants use an astounding amount of

resources and continuously run lights, ovens,
ranges, walk-in coolers, sinks and dishwashers
from early morning to late at night. Minimiz-
ing waste, conserving resources and manag-
ing controllable expenditures are all in the
best fiscal interests of restaurants, but these
concerns are dwarfed by the sheer size of our
University. (Actual energy use data is not pro-
vided by Dining Services nor are the standard
operating procedures documented within the
dining halls.) Dining Services has to take a
bottom-up approach to the problem and also
provide transparency in its operations.
Unlike a restaurant, Dining Services
works under a budget rather than working
for a profit - making it a static system. This
static approach undermines the necessity to
conserve or minimize waste if everything is
planned out and essentially purchased for
the following year. There were numerous
comments on the Daily's article regarding
food waste and its relationship with the
quality, or lack thereof, of the food. If Dining
Services is truly concerned about conserving
waste and increasing efficiency, what is
needed is a dynamic system that produces
and responds to the demands and behaviors of
consumers. Dining Services has done a great
job listening to students and implementing
sustainable initiatives, but switching to high
efficiency light bulbs doesn't hide the SUV in
the driveway.

I've got bad news for parents, state Legislatures,
school officials and state authorities: Underage kids
drink alcohol. While I am not speaking on behalf of
everyone under the age of 21, nor am I endorsing under-
age alcohol consumption, t do have some thoughts on
the recent alcohol legislation in Michigan.
On Nov. 1, a new law concerning the sale of beer kegs
will go into effect throughout Michigan. Under the
current keg law, a customer wishing to purchase a keg
simply has to provide an ID, put money down for the
keg deposit and transport the keg to their car without
receiving a hernia. Under the new law, those wishing to
purchase a keg must provide his or her name, driver's
license number, date of birth, address and telephone
number to the store cashier who will then copy this
information onto atag on the keg. If this tag is removed,
the purchaser of the keg is liable to face misdemeanor
charges including up to 93 days in jail and/or up to $500
in fines. These tags will allow police officers to know
exactly who bought the keg, when they bought it and
who sold it to them.
The overall goal of the legislation is so police officers
can identify who is responsible for providing alcohol at
parties they break up. If police were to discover under-
age drinking at a party, they can check the keg tag, trace
the person who bought the keg and charge that person
for serving alcohol to minors - a penalty which includes
up to 60 days in prison and/or a $1,000 fine. With this
liability when buying a keg, one can safely assume that
keg sales in a college town like Ann Arbor will most
likely drop. Strickland Market, a local liquor store on
Geddes Avenue, has already announced that it will stop
selling kegs once the new law goes into effect. For all you
alarmed underage drinkers out there: Don't worry, there
is a solution, and that is where the true problem lies.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder recently passed a sepa-
rate liquor law that pertains strictlyto hard alcohol. Sny-
der's bill, which takes effect next October, will eliminate
the state tax on hard alcohol. This tax elimination will
make hard alcohol cheaper and will most likely cause
liquor sales to rise.

The keg law is meant to limit the amount of beer
served to underage kids, yet the liquor law is meant to
enhance the sale of hard alcohol. I'm not an expert, but
isn't it dangerous to replace beer with hard alcohol? If
people actually replaced each 12 oz beerthatthey drank
with a measured 1.5 oz shot of hard alcohol - which has
the same alcohol content - this wouldn't be a problem.
But I don't remember seeing too many students wielding
measuring cups at the last fraternity party I attended.
State officialsbelieve they can actually curb underage
drinking with this new keg law. Instead, kids will most
likely find substitutes for a keg, like canned beer or hard
alcohol. According to Georgia state officials - one of 30
other states that currently have a similar keg registra-
tion law - there is little evidence to prove that this type
of law leads to a conclusive decline in underage drink-
ing. State officials claimed that kids in Georgia were
now more likely to replace their kegs with hard alcohol.
Imagine the effect this keg law will have in a state that is
simultaneously lowering its liquor tax.
Kids are going to drink no matter what law is put in
place. Authorities can work toward limiting underage
alcohol consumption - oftentimes effectively - but
eventually, kids will find a way to bypass the law and
obtain alcohol illegally. When kids replace beer with
hard alcohol, that's when people can seriously get hurt.
When you see a kid being carted out of the Big House on
game day after drinkingtoo much, odds are it wasn't the
beer that almost killed him. Didn't we learn anything
from the "Four Loko" fad of 2010?
While state authorities obviously have to fight under-
age drinking, forcing kids into situations in which buy-
ing hard alcohol is easier than beer is not the answer. If
state officials seriously want to stop kids from drinking,
they're going to have to be much more delicate with the
situation than this. So to the party animals, fraternity
stars and the innocent freshman, enjoy your keg beer
this Halloween because the Ann Arbor party scene
could drastically change next Tuesday.

The good news for the Michi-
gan football team is that offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges
identified the offense's problem
in its loss to Michigan State. The
bad news is that he's got a lot
more work than people original-
ly thought.
At Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's radio show last week,
Borges said the Wolverines'
inability to run the ball was what
got them into trouble. The run-
ning backs have struggled for
most of the season. In the past
two games, three different backs
have combined for just 102 yards.
But both the coaching staff and
the players were quick to point
out it hasn't been just the run-
ning backs' fault.
"I think, like anything else,
when you talk about a quar-
terback, and talk about a line-

backer not making as many
tackles, sometimes that's the
front," Hoke said. "(It's the) same
thing with the running backs.
Sometimes it's the opportunities
or what we're doing up front."
The offensive line is look-
ing for a better way to operate.
Fifth-year senior David Molk
said the offensive line deserved
some of the blame because it
hadn't been getting to the sec-
ond level in its blocking. Hoke's
critique didn't get past the line
of scrimmage. He said the line
isn't consistent enough at the
point of attack.
Other than junior quarter-
back Denard Robinson, there
hasn't been much consistency
in the backfield either. No. 18
Michigan opened the season
with 147 rushing yards from its
running backs against Western
Michigan. The group ran for
just 10 yards in the next game.
Before their two poor perfor-

mances against Northwestern
and Michigan State, the running
backs ran for 268 yards against
Minnesota.
"People want to blame one
player or a coach or whatever
and it's generally not that," Borg-
es siad. "It's generally a com-
bination of issues. It certainly
isn't the running backs. ...When
you're not playing well, usually
nobody plays well."
But the most inconsistent
aspect has come from the per-
sonnel. For most of the season,
the load has been carried by
redshirt sophomore Fitzgerald
Toussaint and junior Vincent
Smith. The two began the season
locked in a position battle with
a coaching staff adamant about
finding a lead running back.
Eight weeks later, the two are
still fighting for the spot.
Toussaint appeared to win the
job coming out of camp, beat-
ing out senior Mike Shaw. Then

Toussaint didn't have a carry in
Michigan's second game. Smith,
originally the third-down back,
vaulted himself into the lead
after a 118-yard performance
against Eastern Michigan. Shaw,
who was the favorite coming into
camp, faded out of the competi-
tion early in the season before
reemerging against North-
western. He didn't have a carry
against Michigan State. Hoke
said he would like 100 yards a
game from his running backs
in order to feel good about their
performance. Both Smith and
Toussaint have done it just once
this season.
"No one's standing out, basi-
cally," Borges said. "It's not
something missing. It's just no
one is standing out, and until
somebody does we're going to
operate the way we operate."
Now Borges just has to fix all
the pieces involved in the opera-

'Three and Out' reveals more
about Rodriguez's rocky years

Backup goalie Janecyk
gets needed experience

By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
In "Three and Out," author
John U. Bacon offers a insider's
view of the Michigan football
team never before - and likely
never again - afforded tothe gen-
eral public.
For three years, Bacon was
given the full cooperation of
Rodriguez's staff and free reign
to roam, from the locker room to
team dinners and everywhere in
between.
The resulting book, released
Tuesday, is an all-access, unfet-
tered look at the short reign of
former Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez from inside the walls
of Schembechler Hall.
Bacon previously co-wrote
"Bo's Lasting Lessons" . with
legendary Michigan coach Bo
Schembechler. In his second
coaching biography, Bacon -- a
Michigan alum - pulls no punch-
es, possibly losing a few trusted
sources within the Athletic
Department in the process.
"Three and Out" was initiated
soon after Rodriguez arrived in
Ann Arbor, when the coach's
financial advisor came across
Bacon's work and pitched the idea
for Bacon and Rodriguez to co-
write a series of magazine articles
that would later be turned into a
book.
Both sides agreed. After the
first 3-9 season, Bacon decided
to write the book alone. It was
already clear that the Rodriguez
era was not going to be pretty.
"The book you have in your
hands is not the book I expected
to write," Bacon wrote in the pro-
logue.
After giving Rodriguez's back-
story in the early pages, Bacon
quickly explains the clear-as-mud
coaching search run by then-Ath-
letic Director Bill Martin follow-
ing Michigan coach Lloyd Carr's
resignation in late 2007.
At one point, according to
Bacon, Michigan was just weeks

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Former Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez and his rocky three-year stint in Ann Arbor were the subject of John U. Bacon's
'Three and Out,' which was written after Bacon was granted unlirited access during Rodriguez's tenure.

away from signing LSU coach
Les Miles, who was preparingthe
Tigers for the national champion-
ship game.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman's only stipulation was
that she wanted to meet in per-
son before hiring Miles to replace
Carr. But during a Dec. 12, 2007
conference call between Coleman,
Miles and Martin, Bacon wrote
that Miles refused to meet face to
face until after LSU's final game.
"I would never say no to Michi-
gan," Miles said in the book.
But Michigan didn't wait until
January. That Monday night, it
was Carr, who accordingto Bacon,
first contacted Rodriguez - the
West Virginia coach hadn't even
been considered by Coleman and
Martin.
"Would you be interested in
coaching here?" Bacon reported
Carr asking Rodriguez. "It's a
greatschool, with great tradition.
"Even if you haven't thought
about it, you should think about it
now."
Rodriguez, an offensive guru
known for inventing the spread
offense, was hired as head coach
four days later.

From there, "Three and Out"
goes game-by-game through the
abrupt rises and excruciating falls
of Rodriguez's three Michigan
teams. The 2008 team started
2-2 and ended 1-7. The 2009 team
started 4-0 and ended 1-7. The
2010 team started 5-0 and ended
2-6.
At nearly every turn, the book
details how the Rodriguez regime
was handcuffed for the entirety of
its three-year stint - by alumni,
coaches, fans and the media.
First, after Carr initiated con-
tact with Rodriguez, Carr report-
edly called a team meeting before
Rodriguez's arrival in Ann Arbor
to inform players he would sign
their transfer papers if they
choose to leave.
Then, the NCAA investigation
into potential violations prompt-
ed by the Detroit Free Press took
valuable time and attention away
from the Michigan program
Rodriguez was working to right
after a 3-9 first season. The whole
time, the ever-elusive "Michi-
gan Man" definition hung over
Rodriguez's head from the day he
arrives to the day he leaves.
From the beginning, Rodriguez

misunderstood the title, then he
claimed it for himself. Finally,
after collecting a 15-22 record as
head coach, Rodriguez pleaded to
be considered a "Michigan Man"
in the final season-ending foot-
ball banquet in Dec.2011, a month
before his firing.
The main criticism of Bacon's
book, though, is that it's at times
a one-sided narrative. Many
incriminating questions are raised
about Carr, Martin and current
Athletic Director Dave Brandon,
but almost none are answered by
the men themselves.
"I don't know anything about
the book, and I don't want to know
anything about it," Brandon told
the Detroit News. "Ihave no inter-
est in it. I don't plan to read it."
If for no other reason, the book
is a worthwhile read for its unique,
untold stories that Bacon pulls out
from inside Schembechler Hall
and Michigan Stadium.
Bacon may have burned a few
bridges along the way, but he
offers a meaningful glimpse into
how the hottest young coach in
America became the battered and
beaten "Coach Rod" in three short
years..

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Meet Adam Janecyk, the sopho-
more backup goalie for the Michi-
gan hockey team.
Prior to last weekend, you
hadn't seen much of him during
games. Janecyk had only played
twice this year, for a grand total of
19 minutes. Both times, fifth-year
senior goalie Shawn Hunwick had
already ensured Michigan victo-
ries - 5-0 against Niagara and 10-3
against St. Lawrence.
Finishing the final minutes of
the third period in front of sup-
portive fans is one thing - but
getting thrown into a highly con-
tested road game after the starting
goalie is ejected is quite another.
Ten minutes into the second peri-
od of Friday's game against North-
ern Michigan, Hunwick's punch
to a Wildcat player got him kicked
off the ice for the remainder of the
game.
Enter Janecyk.
"You never know when you're
going to play," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "He didn't expect
it, (but) I thought he came in and
looked like he was ready."
Janecyk tallied 10 saves during
his 28 minutes in front of Northern
Michigan's hostile student section.
And for the first10 minutes, he was
able to hold his own and keep the
score at 0-0.
But then a shot was deflected
past him on a Wildcat power play.
And the Wolverines couldn't crawl
back after Northern Michigan
scored four more goals, including
one on an empty net.
"I really haven't had that much
experience yet, so there are going
to be some nerves," Janecyk said.
"Especially in an environment like
that, it's hard when the fans are
loud.
"Obviously I went right into the
storm there. In a way, the hardest
is over with."
It's not easy being thrust into
a game unexpectedly - Janecyk
didn't even have time to warm up.

His job wasn't made easier by the
vicious Wildcatfanswhoexploded
each time another puck slid past
his glove.
Still, Janecyk impressed his
teammates and his coaches. In
fact, Berenson laughed when he
said Janecyk's performance on
Friday was light years better than
Hunwick's Michigan debut. If this
weekend indicated anything, it's
that Janecyk just needs to get more
comfortable in the crease.
But it's hard for Janecyk to gain
the experience he needs when he
hardly sees any action. He doesn't
have much game film he can
review - all he has to work with is
47 minutes of playingtime.
Berenson said Janecyk just has
to work on his positioning.
"Every shot, you need to be in
position," Berenson said. "The last
shot (Northern Michigan) scored,
he was out of position. You can
close your eyes and stop that if
you're in position."
Janecyk has countless people
supporting him on his journey
to become a better goalie. Josh
Blackburn - Michigan's goalten-
ding coach and former four-year
starting goalie for the Wolverines
- works with all of Michigan's
netminders each week to improve
technique.
But there is perhaps no better
mentor for Janecyk than Hunwick,
who knows the struggles of a back-
up goalie all too well.
"(Hunwick) knows what it's like
(as a backup)," Janecyk said. "He
always gives me tips on waysto get
by and do well here."
When Hunwick is in the net, he
gives the Wolverines tremendous
confidence on the ice. Now, Jane-
cyk is working to instill that same
faith when he is in the goal.
"We can get down the road
where points get tight and we
get in playoffs," Janecyk said. "If
Shawn got hurt or kicked out, my
number will be called on. (This
weekend) was a good experience
for me, and (I'll) be ready for next
time."

Ann Arbor is typically a peace-
ful town. At the University, stu-
dents converse in the Diag, friends
catch up for a meal on State Street
and squirrels nibble quietly on
some thrown-out snacks. But to
author, '73 alum and U.S. Admin-
istrative Law Judge Debra Gold-
stein, Ann Arbor is the location of
a murder.
Goldstein hosted a book sign-
ing on Monday at Nicola's Books
on Jackson Ave., where she dis-
cussed her journey to becom-
ing a writer and her new book,
"Maze in Blue," concluding with
a question-and-answer section.
A group of 10 men and women
sat in the cozy bookstore listen-
ing to Goldstein, who was char-
ismatic and excited while talking
about how she became a writer.
She explained to the crowd that
this book is ina sense, her dream
- and her dream takes readers
down a road of murder, mystery
and alittle Michigan history.
In "Maze in Blue," her debut
novel, Goldstein and her readers
travel back to a 1970s Ann Arbor,
where protagonist and 'U' senior
Denney Silber's best friend Helen
is suspiciously murdered. Den-
ney feels compelled to solve the
mystery of Helen's death. To add
another dimension, Goldstein
took bits and pieces of the Uni-
versity and planted them into the
story.
"There are a lot of places here
that I thought just lent themselves
to murder or to some whodunit
intrigue," Goldstein said.
Whether the characters are
in Markley's Blagdon Hall or the
Law Quad, or are members of
deactivated local sorority Col-
legiate Sorosis, the University
plays a large role in the mystery
of Helen's murder. The Univer-
sity's many mazes also make their
way into "Maze in Blue," from its
interconnected buildings to the
underground steam tunnels link-
ing together the campus.

cHALET PUBLISHERS
Parts of "Maize in Blue" take place in steam tunnels beneath the University.

"Obviously it's a play on the
color, but ina murder mystery it's
always a maze to solve it," Gold-
stein said.
Goldstein said two different
groups of people are picking up
the book: mystery readers and
alumni. Readers connect to the
general college experience por-
trayed in the story, as well as to
specific sites and locations.
"I drew upon experiences that
I've had," Goldstein said. "I drew
upon experiences that would've
been fun to have. I drew upon
locations and things that you
could do."
While Goldstein - also a one-
time Jeopardy finalist - is now
a novelist, she remains an active
judge, too. She keeps her govern-
ment life separate from her writ-
ing butwants her characters to go
in the same direction she did -
completing their undergraduate
degree at the University and then
going on to practice law.
Though Goldstein enjoys her
time as a judge and law practi-
tioner, she feels legal writing is
stifling.
"I kind of lost my creative abil-
ity, but I didn't think anything
of it," Goldstein said. "But I was

always the one who would write
the skits - like when you're going
to roast somebody or do a corny
thing, I was the skit writer."
Goldstein explained that a skit
she wrote for a group project
helped her career take off. Her
friend's husband commented on
her writing ability and then from
there she went on her innovative
adventure, writing chapters for
her novel, entering essay contests
and even winning one. That essay,
"Maybe I Should Hug You," was
published for More Magazine
online.
"Sometimes somebody just
says the right thing to you and it
changes your attitude," Goldstein
said of her rise.
Goldstein is contracted to the
publishing company Chalet Pub-
lishers to write another book
- a follow-up to "Maze in Blue."
It hasn't been written yet, but
she has a few more tricks up her
sleeve.
"This has been just a fun
release," Goldstein said. "It's been
such a great outlet. And because I
have the other job, I've been able
to not be tied to what a success is,
If it makes money, if it doesn't and
I give it all away, that's fine, too."

to create a program that would
advance the lives of her students

course of one year, she would
teach high school students

put this skill set to the test by
developing their own construc-

an appearance in Ann Arbor to

Studio H is located in North

It wasn't his pineapple hefe-
weizen, nor was it his traditional
mead.
Instead, it was Matthew
Waugh's Irish Red Ale that notched
second place honors - a brew he
considered least likely to win, not-
ing disappointment with its begin-
nings.
"I wasn't happy with how it
turned out when I initially made
it because it was very malt light,"
Waugh said. "It didn't have as
much malt in it. It wasn't the alco-
hol concentration that I wanted."
Waugh's recipe, loosely inspired
by a home brewing kit, included his
own custom touches like integrat-
ing ginger into the ale.
The final brew marked a signifi-
cantly "mellowed" product with
a "spicy, effervescent aftertaste,"
Waugh said.
"It was getting on a month and
a half, two months old, and so the
flavor profile had changed a couple

random student interview by kaitlin williams

So, you're a freshman. I take it
you're not 21.
No. Not at all.

- Sarah is an LSA freshman

Years ago, Ann Arbor native Bob Seger wrote a song
about Ann Arbor's Main Street, aptly titled "Mainstreet."
Listening to that song, you'll quickly realize that Main
Street used tobe quite seedy in the late 70s. You can still
find traces of that era in places like the bleach-scented
basement at The Heidelberg, which my friend compared
to the hallway leading to a motel pool and the dingy
Embassy Hotel on Fourth Street.
In the 70s, a plate of spaetzle at The Heidelberg was the
late-night snack for hungry undergrads. These days, the
cheap burritos and beer available on every block of South
University Avenue have taken its place, and Main Street
serves a different crowd.
If you walk down Main Street on a Friday or Saturday
night, you'll find expensive restaurants, bars, unusual
shops and interesting people, most of whom won't be stu-
dents. At the corner of East Liberty Street and Main, you
may find Ann Arbor local Tom Bartlett on his gleaming
red, seven-person bicycle. Ride it.
On the new Main Street, the food is sophisticated and
the beer, artisanal, and the decor seems picked from
every variety of upscale. By midnight, when most of the
restaurants have closed, the crowd at Conor O'Neill's
Traditional Irish Pub & Restaurant is still feasting, and
people are dancing at Rush Street, sipping on martinis at
the Black Pearl and relaxing at the Ravens Club. Outside,
it's quiet. Whereas on South University Avenue, groups of
students in liquor blankets and not much else strut quick-
ly to the next party.
Everyone's got somewhere else to be. But on Main,
they're content to stay where they are.
Most people I talked to said Main was quieter and a nice
place to talk while having a drink. LSA junior Carmine
Riviera, who was dining at the Black Pearl last week, said
she finds the drinking environment to be classier, "and
you don't have to hang out with the unwashed masses."
That last line was not a slur on the South University
crowd so much as an acknowledgment that Main Street
attracts a different clientele. Riviera's friend Gautam
Muthusamy, an LSA junior, said he loves the Black Pearl
because "a lot of pseudo-intellectuals hang out here, like
us, and the martinis are good."
Maybe the martinis are good because they're expen-
sive. The going rate on Main Street for a cocktail --judg-
ing by the prices at Rush Street, the Black Pearl and the
Ravens Club - is about $9. A pitcher of beer at the Jolly

Pumpkin costs at least $18, even on nights when Good
Time Charley's sells them for $3 and the Blue Tractor,
just a block away on East Washington Street, has them
for $7.
Though students didn't mention prices often, it's clear
that as a whole, they're very price-sensitive.
Melanie, a waitress at the Black Pearl, told me that
she sees far more students during happy hour, when the
price of a martini drops by half. For the most part, the
Main Street crowd seems tobe young professionals, not-
so-young professionals and graduate students - the kind
of people who can pay $9 for a martini.
With so many places competing for those martini dol-
lars, new restaurants on Main are trying to differentiate
themselves with unique drinks and memorable interiors.
One of the best complete examples of this trend is The
Ravens Club, a new bar that calls itself a speakeasy.
Outside, a hanging wooden sign painted with a raven
takes the place of a nameplate. Inside, it's a dark place
with an eclectic collection of lampshades and heavy cur-
tains on the front window to hide the goings-on from
snooping prohibition bureau agents. Comfy leather pad-
ding gives bar patrons a soft place to rest their elbows.
Pitch-perfect prohibition chic is about half of The Ravens
Club's appeal. The other half is its drinks. I can't imag-
ine that many other places use pumpkin puree and carrot
juice as mixers.
Jeff Paquin, a managing partner of The Ravens Club,
has researched the history of 207 South Main, the club's
address. His interest in the building's history is reflected
in The Ravens Club's menu, which notes that the lot was
once home to the workshop of a cabinet-maker-turned
undertaker.
Not all the bars on Main Street draw inspiration from
history like The Ravens Club, but most use their unusu-
al ambience as a key selling point. The new Main Street
style begins with the desire to create a unique space.
Sitting in The Black Pearl, I can see how the desire for
uniqueness shapes this bar too. Once again, the place is
dark. A black padded bench runs the length of the res-
taurant, mirrors are held up by jet-black Corinthian col-
umns and above the bar, an entrancing device, rows of
leaf-shaped fan blades silently spins. Perched up high at
a black granite table, you want to lean in as you talk. It's a
good place to have a conversation.
Next toThe Black Pearl is Rush Street, the closest thing

Main Streethas to a night club. Rush Street takes its name
from a street in Chicago, and while the space and style
make it quite different from its neighbors, the bar is like
a derivative of the sleek bars that pop up in any big city.
There's a dress code at Rush Street, enforced by an
impeccably dressedbouncer. When I asked the bartender,
Chris Parow, who he sees in a typical night, he described
a crowd a little younger than the one I saw at other Main
Street locations: almost exclusively young professionals
ranging in age from 21 to 30. The dress code is meant to
keep out "the wrong crowd."
On a normal night, he said Rush Street is "wall-to-wall
dancing." When I visited, it was empty until a 26th birth-
day party appeared, danced, drank and then left.
With 11 years of experience as a bartender, Parow
added that Ann Arbor has "a more educated drink-
ing crowd" whose members constantly ask for drinks
he hasn't "made in a while," which suggests that Rush
Street's patrons aren't always drawn from the Long
Island-swilling youth of South University.
Other bars in the Main Street orbit have less-defined
styles, relying more on drink specials and events to keep
ahead. Cafe Habana on East Liberty has two happy
hours most weeknights and hosts salsa dancing each
week, which can be fun if you like sweaty bodies rubbing
up against you in a hot basement.
I met with some friends at Ashley's on State Street, and
asked why they had decided to meet there, rather than
someplace on South University or Main Street.
One friend said she goes to Ashley's because "it's here,
on Central Campus. There's more beer, and I like the guy
at the door."
Another told an interesting story, "When I didn't know
better, I went to Charley's and the Blue Lep. Then I dis-
covered Main Street, and it changed my life."
She told me the next day that she suggests Main Street
"if you want to avoid drunk, crying girls."
You see fewer undergraduates at the bars on Main
Street because the carefully thought-out ambiance and
high-quality ingredients that give Main Street its reputa-
tion also let restaurants charge high prices. For students
lookingto have a good time on Friday night, a cheap pitch-
er on South University gets the job done without leaving
the wallet light. Of course, there's one other reason stu-
dents go to South University more than to Main Street -
South University is closer towhere they live.

Letter from the editor
For the Statement's third annual Beer Issue, we looked at the craft of
brewing, the challenges of running a business and the pleasures of enjoying
a drink on the town. Our annual home brew competition hosted 34 unique
entries of student- and alumni-brewed beers, evaluated by five certified
judges from the Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild over the course of five hours.
The judges scored each recipe on aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel and
overall impression as well as categories including whitbier, pale ale, Belgian
ale, porter and stout in mind.
Prizes for the top three selections were donated by Adventures in
Homebrewing in Taylor, Mich. The first-place winner recieved a brewing pot,
second place, a lifetime mug club membership at Wolverine State Brewing
Co. and third place, a growler of beer from Wolverine State Brewing Co.
Thank you to everyone who entered, and we hope to taste more batches
of homebrew next year.

How two college buddies created
one of Michigan's premiere craft breweries
Founders Brewing Company was established in Grand Rapids. Mich. nl
A pair of
yellow bolt
cutters
rests on a win-
dowsill in Dave
Engbers's office at Found-
ers Brewing Company, a symbol of the
brewery's never-say-die attitude. Engbers
purchased the bolt cutters in 2001 during
what might've beenhFounders's final week
of business, after the bank threatened to . CI
lock the doors if it didn't receive a payment.
But these days, it's hard to tell that this
craft-brewing giant was once an anemic b
business on the verge of bankruptcy. Its
taproom pulsates with patrons, its main f
brew room has rows of massive tanks that
each hold hundreds of barrels of beer and its
operations are so efficient that some work-
ers are finished before lunchtime.
Yet it seems Founders, located in Grand
Rapids, Mich., shouldn't still be around.
Craft brewing started as a hobby for Eng-
bers, co-founder, vice president and direc-
tor of marketing, and Mike Stevens,
co-founder and president of Founders
Brewing Company. The hobby became
their passion, turned into their business
and for a time, disso ed into a nightmare.
