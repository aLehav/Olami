Many 
staffers 
from 
the 

Ginsberg Center, the Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness Center and the Office 
of Student Life joined graduate 
students to discuss responses to 
the presidential election results 
Thursday afternoon.

The 
discussion, 
labeled 

the “Post-Election Dialogue: 
Impact, Perspective-taking and 
Moving Forward,” took place at 
the Michigan League ballroom 
as part of the 10th annual 
Professional 
Development 

Conference.

Though 
the 
general 

conference 
— 
an 
in-house 

professional 
development 

opportunity for Student Life 
staff — required a fee and 
registration in advance, the 
election 
response 
portion, 

facilitated 
by 
the 
Ginsberg 

Center and Counseling and 
Psychological Services, was free 
and open to all students, faculty 
and staff.

Allie Harte, organizational 

development 
and 
talent 

management 
specialist 
at 

Student Life Human Resources, 
said 
the 
election 
dialogue 

portion was added to the 
event prior to Election Day, 
but received more attention 
following 
an 
email 
from 

President Mark Schlissel on 
Thursday regarding election 

Organizers 
had 
to 
add 

extra chairs to the Pond 
Room in the Michigan Union 
Thursday to accommodate an 
audience of about 40 students, 
veterans and other Ann Arbor 
community members for the 
Women in the Military Panel.

The seven panelists were 

all 
female 
veterans 
and 

students at the University of 
Michigan or Eastern Michigan 
University, and spoke as part 
of the University’s Veterans 
Week, which honors military 
service leading up to Veteran’s 
Day Friday.

The panel was facilitated 

by 
Melissa 
Spaulding, 
a 

counselor 
with 
VetSuccess 

on campus, a program that 
helps 
veterans 
transition 

to college life. She asked 
panelists to share the ways 
they confronted stereotypes 
in their experiences both in 
the military and in life after 
their service. Many panelists 
cited instances in which they 
were asked if they’d served 
even while attending veterans 
events. 
Others 
described 

times during their military 
service in which men believed 
they couldn’t perform tasks at 
the same level as men.

LSA sophomore Cassaundra 

Peterson, 
a 
panelist 
who 

served in the U.S. Air Force, 
outlined 
her 
experiences 

performing 
maintenance 

tasks, and said men often 
offered to carry her tool box 
because they assumed she 
wasn’t capable.

“There was a brief time 

where people assumed I didn’t 
know my job or I couldn’t do 
my job as well as someone else, 
despite having the roles that 
I had taken on or the things 
I had volunteered for,” she 
said. “I remember thinking 
‘OK, I have two choices: I’m 

everything they want me to be 
and say that I am or I put my 
nose to the ground and I grind 
it out.’ ”

She 
said 
despite 
these 

prejudices, she was able to 
prove that she was competent 
and change the viewpoints of 
those around her.

“It was a good lesson for me, 

and at the time I didn’t know I 
was learning it,” Peterson said. 
“But those kind of stereotypes, 

and that viewpoint, it is what 
you make of it, you can find 
positives, spin it, and you can 
change people’s minds. It’s not 
something that I feel like you 
have to give in to.”

Another 
panelist, 
LSA 

senior Riva Szostkowski, who 
served in the U.S. Air Force, 
said 
one 
supervisor 
told 

her to “grow a thicker skin” 
regarding the discussion of 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel is often 
the most visible decision-maker 
on campus, but many students 
are unaware of the extent to 
which the school is controlled by 
a governing body called the Board 
of Regents. 

Over the past few years, 

the 
Board 
of 
Regents 
has 

faced criticism for its lack of 
transparency. In interviews, some 
students 
expressed 
confusion 

about Regents and how they 
function institutionally within 
the framework of the University, 
as well as continued concerns 
with the transparency between 
students and regents.

“I always knew they were 

the bosses of the president, 
and thinking about it, yeah, we 
probably 
should 
know,” 
said 

LSA sophomore Kate Roush. 
“But I have never been in an 
institution where there has been 
transparency about the existing 
‘board.’ ”

Similarly, 
LSA 
sophomore 

Joseph Cohen said though he has 
been on campus for two years, he

President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s 
unexpected 
victory 

Tuesday left some wondering how 
he will address a variety of policy 
issues — as Trump’s campaign 
was frequently criticized for a lack 

of detail on his ideas — including 
higher education.

On the University of Michigan’s 

campus, many students said they 
were concerned in particular 
about student debt and dwindling 
government funding for public 
colleges.

Millennial 
beliefs 
most 

frequently 
align 
with 
the 

Democratic Party, and according 
to 
CNN, 
with 
Democratic 

presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton in the 2016 election. 
This trend also reflected beliefs 
of the student population at 
the University — in the most 
recent polling conducted by the 
Michigan Daily, 76 percent of 
respondents said they planned to 

vote for Clinton.

During her campaign, Clinton 

made a point to emphasize 
issues 
that 
would 
help 
her 

secure the youth vote, including 
detailed proposals to address 
rising student debt and increase 
access to higher education as a 
whole. In comparison, Trump

About 
40 
student 
and 

faculty 
veterans 
gathered 

Thursday 
night 
near 
the 

flagpole in the Diag with cake 
and camaraderie to ring in 
the 241st birthday of the U.S. 
Marine Corps.

Fifteen attendees wore only 

their boots and underwear 
— referred to as “silkies” by 
attendees — as part of the 
Veterans Week tradition. The 
cake was cut with a traditional 
non-commission 
officer 

sword that students received 
approval from the Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
to have on campus, according 
to 
lecturer 
Eric 
Fretz, 
a 

University of Michigan alum. 
The ceremony was observed 
by Marines who were no 
longer on active or on reserve 
duty, with the goal of showing 

respect for the members and 
traditions of their community, 
Fretz said, and that as part 
of the ceremony, the cake 
first went to the oldest and 

youngest Marine present.

Business senior Jonathan 

Chen, president of the Student 
Veterans 
Association, 
said 

he organized the event for 
the first time three years ago 

and has been coordinating it 
ever since. Chen said it felt 
particularly 
meaningful 
to 

be surrounded by his peers 
because this will be his last 
year participating in the event.

“I think the biggest thing 

is … nobody’s going to do it 
but us,” Chen said. “This kind 
of camaraderie and revelry 
and us being kind of stupid as 
well — it brings us together in 
the end of the day. In terms 
of social identities, this is our 
culture, this is what we’re 
used to.”

Art & Design senior Julian 

Rebel, who was given the first 
piece of cake as the oldest 
veteran at the ceremony for 
the second year in a row, 
said he feels grateful for the 
community 
they 
have 
on 

campus.

“I’m glad we practice this 

tradition 
on 
this 
campus, 

not just because of the large 
amount 
of 
veterans 
that 

we have here, but because 
it’s something that’s really 
sentimental 
to 
each 
and 

every one of us,” Rebel said. 
“We’re very fortunate to be 
in this town where they are 
very receptive of veterans in 
general.”

Student veterans commemorate 
creation of U.S. Marine Corps.

does not know much about the 
board, who they are or what they 
do. 

“I think there might be 

eight members on the board,” 
Cohen said. “I’m pretty sure 
it’s a committee of influential 
alumni who make decisions with 
Schlissel.”

The board’s lack of visibility 

may stem from the president’s 
more visible position in times of 
crisis. Schlissel is often the first 
to respond to student concerns, 
holds monthly fireside chats 
with 
30 
students, 
addresses 

the students via email about 
pressing University matters and 
most recently spoke at a protest 
and vigil Wednesday night in 
response 
to 
President-elect 

Donald Trump’s victory.

The board meets only once 

a month to discuss and vote on 
University 
matters. 
Students 

can attend meetings by sitting 
in the audience, but the section 
is physically separated from the 
board by a media table.

Though some regents host 

office hours and work with 
Central Student Government on 
student outreach, the governing 
body does not require them to do 
so.

Created in 1837, the board 

consists of eight regents in total, 
two of whom are elected to 
an eight-year term every two 
years. The University president 
serves as ex officio on the board, 
meaning he is a part of the body 
without being a regent. Regents 
serve without compensation.

When the board votes on 

important decisions at meetings, 
the president often sends out a 
mass email to the University. 
One example is the recent 
appointment of Kelli Trosvig, the 
University’s first vice president 
for information technology and 
chief information officer. In an 
October email to the University, 
Schlissel explained that the board 
approved this new appointment 
and described Trosvig’s role.

LSA junior Alex Contis, a CSG 

representative, said the president 
and various vice presidents’ roles 
are often overemphasized and 
dilute the significance of the 
board.

“When students think of the 

University, they think of the 
president and vice president as 
executing a lot of the decisions 
just because those are the most 
public figures,” Contis said. “I 
honestly don’t think that many 
students at this school can name 
who’s on the Board of Regents.”

CSG President David Schafer 

and 
Vice 
President 
Micah 

Griggs, LSA seniors, proposed 
placing a non-voting student on 
the University’s board to open 
communication 
and 
provide 

increased transparency between 
students and the administration 
during their campaign last winter.

The position, however, has not 

yet been created, and is of dubious 
legality — though all Michigan 
citizens can technically run, 
that would exclude out-of-state 
students, thereby not providing 
equal opportunity for all students, 
according to attorney and current 
regent Mike Behm (D). However, 
the board reinstated a bylaw to 
allow for more student input in 

decision-making during its Sept. 
14 meeting. The bylaw makes the 
vice president for student life a 
liason between students and the 
Board.

Schafer said the low level of 

student interest in the board is due 
to students’ busy lives combined 
with the fact that the board is a 
primarily governing force and not 
always active on campus.

“I think there’s a lot going 

on campus,” Schafer said. “I 
think students are specifically 
immersed 
in 
their 
student 

organizations and their academics 
and their day-to-day lives, and the 
Board of Regents is not always on 
campus, and I think that’s one of 
the reasons why it might be hard 
for students to really get to know 
them.”

Contis noted that CSG’s efforts 

to create a new student seat on the 
board will continue.

“(The board’s) desire to further 

the student body impact in the 
regents’ decision and spreading 
the word is something (CSG) 
wants to do.”

Carl Meyers, who ran for a 

position on the board this election 
cycle but was defeated by Weiser 
and Regent Denise Ilitch (D–
Bingham Farms), advocated for 
creating a student advisory board.

“I am going to have a student 

advisory board advising me on 
challenges and issues facing 
the University from the student 
perspective,” Meyers said. “I will 
hold office hours once a month in 
the student Union where students 
can come and talk.”

Ilitch, won her second term 

Tuesady, also campaigned in part 
on the need for student input on 
University initiatives like the 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
plan.

“We 
definitely 
need 
our 

students 
involved 
actively 

and we should work in strong 
collaboration with them,” Ilitch 
said. “The more that we can learn 
about these issues the more we 
can be reactive to it and navigate 
a healthy conversation around 
these topics.”

Even if students’ role in 

the board’s decision-making 
process were expanded, it is, 
however, not clear students 
would be interested in getting 
involved. 
Of 
the 
students 

interviewed by the Daily, many 
did not express an interest in 
creating a relationship with the 
board.

LSA 
sophomore 
Hailey 

Kruger said she is very active 
in 
encouraging 
political 

participation 
among 
her 

classmates, but said she neither 
knew about the board nor was 
she concerned about her lack of 
knowledge.

Business junior Kevin Gay 

did not express concern either.

“I feel like I only hear about 

the regents when something 
bad happens,” Gay said. “I am 
not really concerned about 
them.”

REGENTS

sexual activity in the workplace, 
and another told her not to wear 
makeup to avoid the impression 
that she “was trying to sleep 
with everybody there.”

“It’s very strange the way 

military men tend to treat 
you,” Szostkowski said. “They 
both want you to be like one of 
the guys, so they can discuss 
whatever they want to around 
you but at the same time reserve 
the right to hit on you whenever 
they choose.”

According to the Statistic 

Brain Research Institute, women 
tend to be underrepresented 

in the military, with only 14.6 
percent filling active duty roles. 
Because of the relatively low 
numbers of enrolled women, 
Spaulding asked panelists what 
advice they would give to any 
female students in the audience 
considering joining the military.

Rackham 
student 
Allison 

Tyler, a panelist who served in 
the U.S. Navy, said they would 
have to prove themselves to 
their superiors and peers.

“Be 
prepared 
to 
prove 

yourself, more than the men 
will have to … People will tell 
you that you can’t, people will 
tell you that you’re not good 
enough, people will tell you that 
you should have done it faster 
because you should have proven 
yourself more,” she said. “The 
fact that you’re doing it is proof 
enough. Just be prepared for 
it and don’t quit. Don’t give in 
to the people who tell you that 
because you’re a woman, you 
cannot do it.”

LSA junior Andie Bulbin, 

said she attended the panel 
because she wanted to further 
her understanding of veteran’s 
experiences.

response opportunities.

Harte also noted conversations 

and 
sentiments 
surrounding 

the election results fit well in 
conjunction 
with 
this 
year’s 

conference theme of identity, 
wellness and work.

“The outcome of our election 

has a lot of impact for people 
across many identities,” she said. 
“We know that there are people 
who are happy about the election 
and people who are not happy 
about the election. Identity is a 
part of that. We want to be able 
to address that, how people are 
feeling, how they are processing, 
give space for that and to be in 
community with each other.”

Erin Byrnes, lead of Democratic 

Engagement and Community-
Based 
Work-Study 
at 
the 

Ginsberg Center, led the dialogue. 

In her opening remarks, Byrnes 
said she wanted to create a space 
for people to start a conversation 
in a supportive environment.

“No matter where you fall 

on the political spectrum, even 
if you don’t really see yourself 
as a political person, these are 
some challenging times, again, 
regardless of your identity and 
how you see yourself,” she said. 
“I think there is much to be 
discussed right now, there are a 
lot of feelings and a lot of thoughts 
that we’re holding.”

Attendees broke into seven 

groups of about seven people 
each to discuss prompts that were 
placed on the tables.

Questions included: “Are there 

identities you hold that have been 
impacted this election cycle?” 
and “What are some productive 
strategies (approaches, phrases, 
questions) that can be used in 
challenging conversations?”

Groups discussed and wrote 

down their opinions on the 

potential impact of President-
elect Donald Trump, as well as 
concerns and ideas that can be 
implemented moving forward.

Staff 
members 
from 
one 

group emphasized community 
engagement 
in 
their 
notes, 

writing, “(We) need to talk 
together and understand although 
we cannot all get what we want, 
we can try to accommodate.”

Members of this same group, 

who 
requested 
to 
remain 

anoymous, 
said 
they 
felt 
it 

was 
necessary 
to 
normalize 

supportive places, as well as find 
ways to stay physically safe and 
secure.

Neeraja 
Aravamudan, 
the 

assistant director for engaged 
learning at the Ginsberg Center, 
said it is important for people to 
have a voice and feel comfortable 
expressing opinions especially 
with people in their lives who 
have different beliefs.

“Personally, I see a lot of 

people struggling with a lot of 

emotion, struggling with how to 
talk to folks who differ so much 
from them in terms of what they 
believe and how to reach those 
who we might — whether it’s 
family or friends we might care 
about — feel we’re fundamentally 
different from, either in values or 
in ideology or actions, and how 
to continue to have a relationship 
while challenging someone.”

She added she felt the election 

exposed 
many 
underlying 

nationwide issues.

“I don’t think people feel 

comfortable returning to normal, 
how to move forward, how to 
figure out the strategies that 
allow us to feel like we have 
agency to change the future and 
to have an impact and to continue 
to process the emotion in order to 
move toward action,” she said. “I 
think that’s the big piece.”

GINSBERG

referred to white supremacy as 
a system designed to prioritize 
and benefit one group over 
another, and said racism was 
engraved in the roots of the 
country.

“Racism is not just about 

interpersonal 
discussions, 
it 

is about policies,” Islam said. 
“Racism 
is 
something 
that 

morphs and evolves over time.”

Islam listed several ways 

for students to combat recent 
incidents on campus, such as 
anti-Black, 
anti-Muslim 
and 

anti-LGBTQ posters found on 
campus, 
including 
listening 

to and showing compassion 
for minority students. MSA 
President Farhan Ali, an LSA 
junior, said this was the main 
reason they invited Islam to 
speak.

“We want to try to build 

relationships 
with 
other 

minority groups on campus,” 
Farhan said. “We want to try to 
educate members in MSA about 
racism. They share the same 
struggles we do.”

LSA sophomore Hiba Asad, an 

MSA member who attended the 
event, said she felt empowered 
by Islam’s talk.

“I feel like a lot of times 

we’re always told to stand up 
for different subcommunities 
within the overarching Muslim 
community, 
and 
even 
non-

Muslims, 
groups 
that 
are 

marginalized in America,” Asad 
said. “I feel like it’s always nice 
to have tangible ways to go 
about that.”

Throughout the talk, Islam 

stressed 
the 
importance 

of education and making a 
sustained 
effort 
to 
affect 

change for the betterment of 
race relations on campuses and 
in communities.

With education, she noted, 

comes a compulsion to liberate 
and 
de-stigmatize 
other 

minority groups.

Islam’s 
talk 
was 

coincidentally scheduled just 
days 
after 
President-elect 

Donald Trump won the general 
election. Several students in 
attendance 
mentioned 
how 

they felt a renewed sense of 

fear on campus following the 
results — during his campaign, 
Trump made several negative 
comments regarding Muslim 
Americans that have sparked 
concern among members of the 
campus community.

“It’s a hard time to be a 

minority and a person who is 
actively standing up for them,” 
Asad said.

Islam concluded her speech 

by telling the crowd to “have 
heart” in the face of uncertain 
times ahead.

“Just because society might 

marginalize these individuals 
doesn’t mean that we need to,” 
she said. 

RACISM

never released a developed plan 
or position on student debt. 
Trump’s interviews and position 
statements during the campaign 
had few comments pertaining to 
student debt other than stating it 
is a problem.

Student debt in particular is 

currently a major concern for 
college students. More than 40 
percent of Americans who have 
borrowed from the government’s 
main student loan program either 
aren’t making payments or are 
behind, according to a quarterly 
report from the Department of 
Education. These loans total 
more than $200 billion spread 
out among 22 million Americans, 
and those numbers are on the 
rise. That number does not 
encapsulate private loan debt.

LSA 
sophomore 
Jessica 

Ankley is worried about both the 
current levels of student debt and 
the prospect of an exponential 
growth in tuition costs.

“As someone who is trying to 

avoid more debt, it’s sad,” Ankley 
said. “I feel like it digs us deeper 

into this hole of student debt 
and being trapped within the 
fact that education is already so 
expensive.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Morgan Meade wrote in an 
e-mail interview that one of the 
defining factors in whom she 
voted for in this election was 
which party would support her 
in pursuing her education.

“Trumps platform on reducing 

student debt is incredibly vague 
as he claims that he will work 
with congress to make sure that 
universities make a “good faith 
effort” to reduce college costs 
and student debt in exchange for 
tax breaks,” Meade wrote in an 
email interview. “This platform 
seems dismissive of the subject 
since most colleges are not the 
holders of student debt … As a 
young voter, I definitely wish that 
I could have heard more about 
education from both parties.”

Meade wrote that Trump’s 

lack of a plan is worrisome for 
future generations, given his 
influence as president.

“This shows a lack of regard for 

the country after his presidency 
since college-age students will be 
entering the workforce after his 

first term but he hasn’t considered 
the federal assistance that many 
students need to complete their 
education,” Meade wrote. “If 
the next generation of college 
students are trapped paying off 
their debts for many years after 
graduation as students are now, 
the income of these students that 
should be spent stimulating the 
market will end up back in the 
hands of banks.”

The Republican Party platform 

as a whole, which consists of 
more than 60 pages, has slightly 
more on the topic, dedicating 
two sections to college costs 
and general higher education. 
The platform suggests that the 
federal government abstain from 
involvement with student loans 

and instead shift the loans to the 
private sector.

“In order to encourage new 

modes 
of 
higher 
education 

delivery to enter the market, 
accreditation should be decoupled 
from federal financing, and states 
should be empowered to allow a 
wide array of accreditation and 
credentialing bodies to operate,” 
the document reads.

Cynthia Wilbanks, University 

vice president for government 
relations, 
said 
regardless 
of 

what legislative action is taken 
in regards to student debt, the 
University 
will 
continue 
its 

work in assisting students with 
financial aid and offering up their 
own experience throughout the 
legislative process.

“There are high-level goals in 

terms of helping students afford 
a college education,” Wilbanks 
said. “They certainly are the right 
goals. The legislative process 
works in largely mysterious ways. 
Nonetheless, it does take time 
for ideas to get developed into 
legislative bills … but we will have 
time to look at the specifics, have 
a chance to react and provide our 
own experience as to what we 
have been able to do.”

TRUMP
From Page 1A

“Trump’s platform 

on reducing 

student debt is 

incredibly vague.”
“Be prepared to 
prove yourself, 
more than the 

men will have to.”

“I honestly don’t think 

that many students at this 

school can name who’s on 

the Board of Regents.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I 

am a political junkie. I live and 
breathe for a constant stream 
of news and punditry from 

a variety of network 
programs, newspaper 
articles and podcasts. I 
even follow polling data 
and aggregate websites 
like an addicted sports 
gambler. 
Yet 
this 

Election Day, I decided 
to 
distance 
myself 

from every form of 
social media and piece 
of news, turned on 
Netflix and ended up 
understanding something more 
about myself. On election night, 
detached from social media and 
blind to the results, I fully came 
to recognize a sad similarity that I 
share with our now President-elect 
Donald Trump.

Not only do I live for politics, I 

also live for social media. I almost 
inherently have to come to crave 
the constant gratification that my 
online presence guarantees me. 
Within this university’s social 
setting, that necessity to be part 
of something — or to fit in — is a 
driving factor in my constant use of 
social media and my pathetic desire 
to paint the picture of happiness to 
others through the lifeless form of 
the internet.

On election night, in order to 

distract myself during the results, 
I began watching the new season 
of 
the 
Netflix 
psychological 

thriller “Black Mirror” — and 
terrifyingly — the absence of any 
form of social media that night was 
accompanied by the first episode 
of this season dealing with social 
media gratification.

I watched a woman living in a 

world in which social desirability 
is rated on a numerical scale that 
everyone can see. She strives to 
reach the upper tiers of society 
by appeasing other higher-rated 
members of society through the 
most artificial and empty displays 
of 
human 
emotion. 
Human 

interaction 
finally 
becomes 

artificial, and people essentially only 
see what they want to see. Without 
giving away too much, her lust for 

social desirability backfires, and 
she experiences the utter turmoil 
of losing her artificially constructed 

life 
full 
of 
fake 

smiles, 
frappuccinos, 

Instagram posts and 
totally 
fabricated 

“happiness.” 

When the episode 

ended, I was fairly 
certain the writers had 
somehow 
recorded 

the anxious thoughts 
in 
my 
mind 
and 

transcribed them into 
a script. Recently, I 

have come to understand that I 
have had a disturbing necessity 
for gratification through forms of 
social media and had constructed a 
false image of who I desired to be. 
The anxiety and stress I induced 
on myself since arriving to college 
pushed me to attempt to form a 
false narrative that only I knew 
was fake — and I thought it would 
somehow grant me “happiness.” I 
had this belief that if I fit in this way, 
dress this way, drink this much, 
that these artificially constructed 
traits would form into an equation 
equaling happiness.

Yet the turmoil of constantly 

using separate forms of social 
media to shape a “happy” presence 
within this hyper-connected world 
is downright exhausting. Twitter is 
there to let people know what you’re 
doing and what you’re thinking; 
Facebook to make sure you don’t 
miss out on parties or events; 
Instagram to plaster your life for 
others to see as a fairy tale; and my 
favorite, Snapchat, to remind others 
that you did, in fact, drink copious 
amounts of alcohol and danced like 
a moron at Rick’s last night because 
you are fun!

More disturbing, my constant 

anxiety robbed me of time I spent 
by myself. I lost who the actual 
“me” was to some extent. Any 
moment alone was accompanied by 
the rushing fear of missing out — a 
feeling that was immediately dulled 
and delayed by my use of social 
media. My outward personality of 
being outgoing, funny and friendly 
shattered so easily from a mere 

hour of loneliness. I had created 
someone I was not.

Sitting there alone in my 

apartment during election night, 
all of my thoughts I have had on 
my pathetic pursuit of happiness 
were suddenly paired with the 
idea of a President Trump. I 
identified with him.

And I would like to thank him, 

because through him, I can see that 
he is the physical manifestation 
of vanity and constant image-
building. He is nothing. Yet he 
has constructed this idea around 
himself that he is the greatest, 
richest and happiest man alive. His 
outward appearance of dressing in 
a suit, attempting to look like he’s 
only 38 at the age of 70, plastering 
his name on everything he touches, 
having the “best” of everything 
and most importantly, using his 
celebrity and fame to make sure 
everyone sees how amazing his life 
is. His sense of self is so weak and 
fragile that he needs the constant 
gratification of millions of people 
to support his pathetic sense of ego.

And that is so sad. He is 

obviously a horribly sad man and 
nothing — not even the presidency 
— will satisfy his bottomless hunger 
for social gratification. He is an 
endless cycle of attempting to fill a 
hole in his heart with everything 
that money can buy: fame, material 
goods, the Oval Office. 

To some very minor point, I can 

identify with that endless struggle 
to somehow “be content” or 
satisfied. Yet today I have distanced 
myself from my constant obsession 
and use of social media as a 
method of achieving “happiness.” I 
have found other things within my 
life that every once in while come 
together in certain ways to make 
me feel joyous. My highs get high 
and my lows get low. I feel human.

Now, I look at a man we will 

call our president — a man who 
has literally everything in the 
world — and all I can see in him 
is utter depression, emptiness 
and sadness.

The republic will stand

A

t first I was confused. 
So confused it made 
me want to go to sleep 

and wake up in a world that 
made 
more 
sense. 

Then I was scared 
for 
a 
long 
time. 

But after hours of 
restless thought and 
a series of scattered 
conversations, I think 
I understand a bit 
more what happened 
on Tuesday night, 
and why. So now, I’m 
angry.

Let’s 
start 
with 

the basics. It’s important to note 
that not everybody who cast 
their ballots for Donald Trump 
did so because they like Donald 
Trump. Some do, and, in many 
of those cases, the long string 
of descriptors and indictments 
you’ve likely seen in a slew 
of wordy, didactic Facebook 
statuses 
about 
Trump’s 

horribleness, is deserved. But, 
in fact, when asked by the Pew 
Research Center in late October, 
51 percent of Trump supporters 
responded 
that, 
more 
than 

anything else, they were voting 
against Hillary Clinton.

There were Trump voters 

in all 50 states who cast their 
ballots not because they were 
ignorant of the major flaws in 
their candidate or agreed with 
the terrible things he has said 
and done. They voted in spite of 
that, looking past the obvious 
and abundant negatives and 
seeing the potential for change. 
They did what a lot of liberals 
and Bernie Sanders supporters 
did when they decided to “come 
home” and support a Democratic 
nominee with a history of 
scandal and distrust of the media, 
whose views differed from their 
own. So thinking about Trump 
supporters as a horde of hateful, 
uneducated white supremacists 
and xenophobes is harmful to 
the conversation. Those people 
exist (and thrive) in his camp and 
for that there is no excuse, but 
they alone did not deliver him 
an electoral victory. Posting 
a Facebook status instructing 
anyone who voted for Trump 
to unfriend you in an attempt 
to retreat even further into 
your liberal bubble is harmful 
to the conversation.

In 
Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, 

Wisconsin and Michigan, white 
working-class voters had the 

choice between a candidate 
they 
despised, 
viewed 
as 

untrustworthy 
and 
who 
to 

them represented more of the 

same, and a wild 
card who presented 
an 
opportunity 

for 
change. 
It 
is 

absolutely essential 
to understand their 
point of view rather 
than run from them 
or call them names 
in order to ensure 
that 
this 
never 

happens again.

In the Democratic 

nominee, 
from 
the 
very 

beginning, these voters saw an 
embodiment of establishment 
politics that was not listening to 
them. Mitt Romney and George 
Bush’s GOP was the party of the 
wealthy, of young professionals 
and small businessmen who 
shared some of their core values 
but failed to bear the mantle of 
the working class. Meanwhile, 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

coalition was composed of young 
people, African Americans and 
Latinos. For all intents and 
purposes, the white working-
class voter was forgotten and 
left out. Then Donald Trump 
descended from an escalator 
and gave them a voice. You may 
find irony, as I do, in the fact 
that a man who has spent his 
life ripping off contractors and 
litigating his way out of paying 
workers is now their champion. 
But in Trump, they feel heard. 
On Tuesday night, they made it 
clear that the Democratic Party 
cannot win by simply rebuilding 
the Obama coalition time and 
again while losing touch with 
the white working class.

So when I say that I’m angry, 

I don’t mean that I blame Trump 
supporters, without discretion 
and across the board, for the 
next four years. I disagree 
profoundly with the choice these 
voters made, but I’m beginning 
to understand more and more 
why they made it.

I cannot adequately express 

my anger, however, with the 
Democratic 
Party. 
I 
am 
a 

registered Democrat, I have 
campaigned 
and 
volunteered 

for Democrats, and my room is 
littered with T-shirts, stickers 
and 
posters 
in 
support 
of 

Democrats. But I will happily 
join the millions of liberals 
across the country who are 

saying, in no uncertain terms, 
that our party failed us. No one 
could have seen this coming? If 
a political party cannot organize 
to defeat the least qualified and 
most disliked candidate in the 
history of presidential politics 
(not to mention that it cannot 
obtain a majority in either house 
of Congress), what purpose does 
that party serve me?

One can speculate about what 

would have happened had Bernie 
Sanders or Joe Biden been the 
nominee, but Jan. 20 is not all 
that far away and we have bigger 
fish to fry, so hindsight can wait. 
Here I am, trying to understand 
what happened a little more 
today than I did yesterday, 
absolutely 
furious 
with 
my 

party and terrified what the 
next four years will hold. So let’s 
start with the basics.

Liberals 
are 
no 
longer 

burdened with the defense of the 
Clintons or NAFTA or the emails 
or the neoliberalist policies of 
the 1990s. Finally.

There 
is 
an 
enormous 

population of white working-
class voters who feel like they 
haven’t been heard, and it’s time 
to find a way to bring them into 
the fold, not because it’ll make a 
winning coalition, but because 
those people are hurting and it’s 
the right thing to do.

There are at least two long 

years of being in the minority 
ahead, and names on Capitol Hill 
such as Sanders and Warren, 
Harris and Booker have work 
to do — filibusters to hold, aisles 
to reach across and moral high 
grounds to take.

In the most immediate future, 

we have to make people in our 
lives who have been shaken to 
the core by this election feel less 
alone. Tell them that Trump 
voters aren’t all racists and 
bigots, and that the republic will 
stand, by sheer will if nothing 
else. Liberals and progressives 
are not all moving to Canada. 
We’re staying right here to make 
sure that this country does not 
lose the progress that has been 
made, drawing lines in the 
sand, saying that civil rights and 
human rights and health care 
and the environment and the 
safety of friends and neighbors 
are non-negotiable. Fired up, 
ready to go.

Thursday, after a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump.
“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

I believe it is important for all of us, regardless of 
party and regardless of political preferences, to 
now come together, work together, to deal with 

the many challenges that we face.

Y

esterday our country got 
the first glimpse of a Trump 
presidency. 
He 
spoke 

about infrastructure spending, a 
conservative court and the need to 
come together as a nation. He named 
his energy and environmental policy 
transition teams, including a long-
standing climate change denier.

We also saw the pain throughout 

campus and, on social media, of our 
generation. Many of us feel a deep, 
inescapable sense of loss. It’s not 
because our team (i.e., supporters 
of Clinton, progressives) lost just 
like the Clevland Indiands lost 
the World Series, as our new 
Regent Ron Weiser suggested 
yesterday at a Ford School of 
Public Policy panel yesterday.

Part of this pain is due to a 

feeling of uncertainty. Like many 
of my classmates at the Ford School 
of Public Policy, I’ve wondered if 
the election is a referendum on 
public policy. After all, Trump’s 
team offered almost no policy 
papers, yet he commandingly won. 
Other students, in the social and 
environmental sciences, are asking 
similar questions. What we study 
is a reflection of who we are: our 

values, background and aspirations. 
 

Acknowledging this uncertainty, 

however, does little to lessen the 
pain. What’s grinding away at many 
of us is a loss of hope that inequalities 
would decrease, and injustices would 
become less common. This loss is 
seemingly unavoidable, both general 
and intimate.

Earlier this fall, I confided to 

a classmate in a policy course on 
values and ethics that I feel deeply 
uncomfortable with my own white 
male privilege. I benefit from things 
that I shouldn’t. Research shows I’m 
more likely to get a job because of my 
name. I’m less likely to be pulled over 
while driving. I get the benefit of the 
doubt — for example, when walking 
at night, returning a purchase or 
asking for feedback. And now, with 
an elitist white male in the White 
House who has repeatedly put 
down women, minorities, the 
disabled and the poor, this inequity, 
it seems, will become even more 
pervasive and damaging.

What is most distressing is 

knowing this unfairness affects 
aspirations, dreams and ambition. 
After Obama’s first election, we 
celebrated that children of color 
now had a marker of what’s truly 
possible for them. It seemed that an 
“aspiration gap” — a gap that hinders 
the disadvantaged from pursuing 

their hopes — would begin to close.

Many of us on campus have 

intimately heard, seen and felt this 
loss: of classmates of color trying 
to explain to younger siblings that 
the election isn’t a reflection of 
our country’s belief in them; of 
immigrants having lost a sense 
of home, now feeling unsafe and 
unwelcome; of daughters, classmates 
and friends seeing a leader of the free 
world who has repeatedly objectified, 
demeaned and assaulted women.

How can we begin to move 

forward, then?

It’s on all of us — young, old, 

progressive and conservative — to 
see those most affected through 
this. In my case, to assure every 
female classmate and friend that 
Trump does not reflect my gender 
values, and that I will do my best to 
stand up for them. To assure people 
of color that social justice will not 
become a “backburner” issue. To 
make every person feel welcome, 
valued and empowered, every day.

As the election neared, I spent 

hours canvassing Ann Arbor to 
get out the vote. On Sunday night, 
a resident approached me as I was 
walking in between houses. She 
offered a story and a reminder, one 
that may help all of us.

She pointed across the street, 

where neighboring houses each 

had a sign: one for Trump, one for 
Clinton. The Trump supporter is a 
90-year-old man living by himself, 
she told me. It was his second sign. 
Weeks earlier, the first was torn 
apart at night and left on his lawn. 
In response, his neighbor — the 
Clinton supporter — immediately 
cleaned up the mess and purchased 
a new Trump sign for him.

She said the story was a reminder 

that Democrats and Republicans are 
on the same team, one that is greater 
than politics. Every four years, one 
party becomes the first string, the 
other the second string. This changes, 
in cycles, in response to events and in 
light of candidate popularity. Both, 
however, contribute to the team’s 
success. Both must support each 
other, she said.

We’re all on the same team — 

the privileged and the vulnerable, 
the wealthy and the indigent, 
progressives and conservatives, 
Trump, 
Bernie 
and 
Clinton 

supporters. Acknowledging this, 
now, is painful. But if we keep 
this in mind when standing up for 
others and engaging with opposing 
viewpoints, perhaps, we’ll grow 
out of this challenging campaign 
and election.

bold 
statement. 

Most notably, she 
has pioneered a 
#NoMakeup move-
ment and called 
upon girls to revel 
in the beauty of their own skin, 
and has also taken on the role 
of coach on NBC’s “The Voice,” 
advising aspiring musicians.

Her newfound roles as mav-

erick and mentor shine through 
in her latest work, Here. As the 
title would suggest, the work 
dwells entirely in the present — 
it reminds listeners the necessity 
of thinking deeply and acting 
accordingly in this tumultuous 
time in American history.

Here opens with an interlude, 

warming listeners up to the 
weight of the beautiful yet heavy 
album. “The Beginning (Inter-
lude)” flows seamlessly into “The 
Gospel,” a track initially backed 
by sweeping piano and strings 
that are easily swapped for a 
snare and a grooving beat as the 
song builds. Keys’s voice snarls 
and scratches as she lays down 
lines depicting a family troubled 
by poverty, crime and money. 
She spits, “If you ain’t in a bat-
tle how you gon win the fight / 
Gotta speak the truth when I’m 
up in the booth.” Right off the 
bat, Keys makes it known that 
Here is going to be more than just 

a friendly, radio-ready record.

The issues tackled by Keys 

are vast — race relations, envi-
ronmental issues, womanhood 
and class. Mirroring the range 
of subject matter is Here’s musi-

cal 
composition. 

There 
are 
ele-

ments of gospel 
combined 
with 

classic 
hip 
hop. 

Soothing piano is 
paired with steady, 
almost 
combat-

ive 
drumbeats. 

Keys’s voice danc-

es between aggressive, loving 
and playful. These multiplicities 
paint Keys as real and complex, 
as an emotional being rather 
than a manufactured artist.

Stripping it down to just her 

voice and a haunting guitar, “Kill 
Your Mama” is one of the album’s 
most raw moments. Keys minces 
no words in telling listeners to 
respect and better treat the plan-
et, though it’s not always clear if 
she is speaking about the Earth 
or a human mother. She takes the 
enormous relationship between 
the human race and the planet 
and shrinks it down to the inti-
mate space between mother and 
child.

Family and relationships play 

a large role in Here, especially 
when considering the complica-
tions of Keys’s relationship with 
current husband Kasseem Dean 
(a.k.a. Swizz Beatz). On “Blended 
Family” she addresses the merg-
ing of her life with that of Dean 
and his family. “Work On It” 
seems to address him directly, 
lovingly crooning “Darling, so 
many lies were spread about us 
… That makes us build all the 

trust.” The track is hypnotic, lay-
ering big, reverberating drums 
with repeated electronic ele-
ments all encased by Keys’s roll-
ing vocals.

“Girl Can’t Be Herself” is 

another shout-out to Keys’s per-
sonal life as well as her public 
activism. The track again plays 
with guitar and bouncing beats, 
making 
the 
tone 
optimistic 

despite its heavy societal impli-
cations. Its light nature implies 
that Keys has found freedom in 
her escape from beauty expec-
tations. Even lines like “Maybe 
all the Maybelline is covering 
my self-esteem” exalt her choic-
es rather than reel in what is 
expected of her.

The album wraps with “Holy 

War,” a reminder of the impor-
tance of love and understanding 
despite all the trials and tribu-
lations previously addressed. It 
would be impossible for one to 
put a label on exactly what Here 
is trying to convey or accomplish 
— from the less than successful 
interludes to tricky tracks like 
“Pawn It All,” there is always 
something new being presented. 
Just like its singer, the album is 
multifaceted, fresh and full on 
intrigue.

The singer-songwriter’s latest work dwells entirely in the present

RCA

Coogi up to my head like I’m Biggie Poppa.

In this miniseries, Daily 

Music Writers reminisce on the 
best live show they ever saw.

Harlem-bred, 
Houston-

influenced A$AP Mob mem-
bers A$AP Rocky and A$AP 
Ferg performed at Coachella for 
the first time in 2012 and 2014, 
respectively. Though separated 
by two years, their sets followed 
the releases of their debut, criti-
cally acclaimed projects (Live. 
Love. A$AP and Trap Lord, 
respectively) and marked the 
beginning of their reign as rap 
powerhouses. I was there for 
both of them.

Can you remember a world 

with Rocky and no Ferg? I 
know, it’s hard for me, too. But 
back in 2011, that was a reality.

I was a junior in high school 

when I heard “Purple Swag” off 
his lesser-known mixtape, Deep 
Purple, for the first time. I didn’t 
even really like rap music then, 
but when the heavily Clams 
Casino-produced 
Live. 
Love. 

A$AP dropped in late 2011, I 
began to look at the genre dif-
ferently — as interesting, exper-
imental, exciting and versatile.

I remember exactly where 

I was the first time I heard the 
opening three song sequence 
of “Palace”-“Peso”-“Bass” — 

Macy Helm’s car, leaving Faith 
Lutheran High School’s park-
ing lot, on a Friday afternoon. 
And it was with Macy Helm five 
months later that I saw Rocky’s 
Coachella Second Weekend per-
formance.

It was Day 2, a Saturday 

night, and in the last 24 hours, 
I’d successfully snuck alcohol 
onto the campgrounds, refused 
to call my mom and seen some-
one smoking out of a crack pipe. 
This must be what adulthood 
feels like!!! I thought, despite 
being only 16 years old — my 
persuasion powers continue to 
amaze both my parents and me.

But that Saturday, we’d just 

left an overwhelmingly aggres-
sive Radiohead set and found 
ourselves in Rocky’s crowd. 
As the rapper took the stage, a 
topless woman grabbed me and 
tried to get on my shoulders. I 
don’t think I’d ever felt more 
alive — terrified, but alive.

I mark that memory as the 

moment I started really loving 
rap music; I date that day as 
the birth of my current musi-
cal tastes. I can’t even really 
tell you who came on stage 
that night (probably the whole 
A$AP crew) or what songs were 
performed, just that his set was 
ground zero for my current 
interests.

By Friday of Coachella 2014’s 

Weekend Two, my affinity for 
rap music had further devel-
oped and A$AP Ferg’s debut 
mixtape-turned-album 
Trap 

Lord had already been out for 
over seven months.

If you looked up “A$AP” on 

Spotify, Ferg popped up before 
Rocky. Despite this, the rapper 
was given a 3:40 set time, one 
unusually early for the sizable 
crowd he was likely to bring. At 
least that’s what my three friends 

and I, who’d gone into the festi-
val earlier than normal to see 
him, thought. We were correct 
in assuming the crowd would 
be huge. Huge and absolutely 
insane. I must say, I don’t think 
you can appreciate the art that 
is Trap Lord until you see your 
friend punching someone in the 
face as it’s being played live.

The album is nothing if not 

aggressive and abrasive, and 
sometimes that fails to trans-
late when just blaring through 
a pair of headphones. Of course, 
“Work REMIX” had been on 
loop in everyone’s headphones 
since its release. But lesser 
played 
tracks, 
like 
“Dump 

Dump,” with its “I fucked your 
bitch, n*gga / I fucked your 
bitch” hook, and “F**ck Out My 
Face,” which essentially just 
repeats its title for the major-
ity of the track, were not as 
well-received out of context. 
The necessary context, if you’re 
wondering, is in the middle of a 
mosh pit, with Ferg inches away 
performing it.

Also, there is literal video 

footage of my friends and me 
at this performance, recorded 
by a kid right behind me, unbe-
knownst to us until later. Feel 
free to look it up on Youtube, 
but I won’t tell you what I was 
wearing or what color my hair 
was at the time.

BEST CONCERT EVER
ALBUM REVIEW

HOPELESS RECORDS

Which one of them is Yellow?

My first time falling in love 

with an album coincided with 
my first time falling out of love 

with a person, during my fresh-
man year of high school.

The 
relationship, 
in 
my 

freshman year of high school, 
was never clearly defined, and 
the end was even less so, which 

meant I had a lot of pent-up 
emotion left over afterward 
and nothing to do with it. Up 
until that point, I’d never real-
ly listened to music, much less 
been emotionally impacted by a 

SAMANTHA LU

For the Daily

How falling out of love helped me to 
fall in love with Yellowcard and punk

Before them, I’d only had a vague idea of how music could move people

song; the extent of my musical 
tastes was whatever was play-
ing on 98.7 AMP radio, com-
bined with whatever songs 
my close friends forced me to 
listen to every once in a while. 
Most of my musical experi-
ence was focused on instru-
mental and classical music 
because I took piano lessons 
from when I was 8 years old 
up until eighth grade.

Yellowcard’s When You’re 

Through Thinking, Say Yes 
marked the beginning of my 
passion for all things punk 
rock. Before that album, I’d 
had only a vague idea of how 
music could move people. 
After months of repeated lis-
tening, I felt connected with 
the artist on a near spiri-
tual level; I remember being 
amazed that something could 
strike such a chord within me. 
That album still brings back 
memories of my frozen hands 
clenched tightly around my 

phone, earbuds plugged in 
tightly, 
marching 
doggedly 

back home from the bus stop 
after an exhausting day at 
school.

I started listening to My 

Chemical Romance not long 
after I was first introduced 
to Yellowcard by one of my 
close friends, but in a twist of 
irony, I didn’t really get into 
them until right after the band 
broke up in March of 2012. 
Where Yellowcard was a ten-
tative toe dipped into rock, 
MCR was a dive headfirst into 
the emo genre. The first song I 
heard by them was “Welcome 
To The Black Parade,” one of 
the most prominent tracks 
in My Chemical Romance’s 
entire 
discography. 
Even 

though it was six years old by 
the time I was in ninth grade, 
I’d never heard it before, and 
the 
immeasurable 
energy 

somehow folded within the 
five minutes and eleven sec-
onds of the recording left me 
absolutely speechless.

I didn’t think it was even 

remotely possible to memo-
rize the lyrics to all 80-plus 
songs in MCR’s discography, 
but it happened all by itself. 
I love all four of their main 
albums, but their first album, 
I Brought You My Bullets, You 
Brought Me Your Love, will 
always hold a place in my 
heart for the way it never fails 

to invigorate me from head to 
toe. Nothing else I’ve heard so 
far can even begin to match 
Gerard Way’s raw, hoarsely 
passionate vocals, the haunt-
ing melodic lines and churn-
ing guitar of which Bullets is 
comprised. Even today, “Our 
Lady Of Sorrows” and “Demo-
lition Lovers” remain some of 
my favorite songs in my musi-
cal collection.

For me, punk rock was 

never about simply rebelling 
for the heck of it. Punk rock 
finds beauty in the unexpect-
ed, flavored with a unique 
brand of musical flair punc-
tuated by aggressive musical-
ity and heavy emotion. It has 
become my conceptual home 
away from home and trans-
formed listening into an act of 
tangible comfort, a personal 
safe haven there for me when-
ever I might need it.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

I had a lot of pent-
up emotion and 

nothing to do 

with it.

Music has 
become my 

conceptual home 
away from home.

Their sets at 

Coachella each 
marked the start 
of their reigns.

We were correct 
in assuming the 
crowd would be 
huge and insane.

Her newfound 
roles as maverick 
and mentor shine 

through.

6A — Friday, November 11, 2016
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I

’m not really sure how to 
start. Today has been long 
and harrowing, and any-

thing I am about to write feels 
like it can’t be more than addi-
tional white noise among the 
incessant 
static of our 
collective 
catatonia.

Like 

many, I 
watched 
election 
returns 
Tuesday 
night as 
my unease 
slowly 
metamorphosed into a spell-
binding horror. I am afraid. 
A dread which had been 
unknown to me has wrapped 
its chilling grip around my 
heart, and I have many fears 
for the future — when the 
jurors of history don their 
robes, when they set us upon 
the scales of worth, what will 
their discerning eyes per-
ceive? What is the measure of 
a people? What is the weight of 
morality? When our children 
look back to find where things 
fell apart, upon whose counte-
nance will their scrutinizing 
gaze settle? Will the scars be 
indelible? Will we, ultimately, 
be found wanting?

I want to believe that Amer-

ica is fundamentally good at 
heart, but this morning, I was 
angry. I still am, but after half 
a day the numbness set in. I’m 
still afraid. But more than any-
thing, I’m tired.

I’m really tired, but I’m 

unable to sleep. It’s 7 a.m. on 
November 10, which means 
that this article is due in a little 
over 10 hours and I haven’t 
slept in 22. After everything, 
the globe still spins. And right 
now it’s my job to say some-
thing about classical music. It’s 
what’s expected of a classical 
music columnist, after all. So 
this isn’t about what just hap-
pened. This isn’t my “J’accuse.” 
It’s not about how we got here. 
We’re not really going to talk 
about this. We’re going to talk 
about music and poetry and art 
and meaning — but also this.

Let me tell you a story. I 

worked from 11 to 5 today —
with a half hour lunch break, 
which I used to sign a lease 
rather than to eat — and when I 
got off I walked across the way 
to the Diag, where there was a 
protest going on.

I walked around the periph-

ery, neither joining in nor 
really paying attention. I had 
headphones in (I was listening 
to the Benjamin Britten “War 
Requiem”) and was looking at 
the ground, where people had 
chalked messages of encour-
agement like “You Belong” or 
“Love Trumps Hate” or “This 
is Still Home,” or the more 
damning “We Let This Hap-
pen.” I felt like crying and did 
not. At around 6 p.m., I caught 
a bus to my apartment near 
North Campus, where I set 
down my bags and sat for a 
moment. I thought about eat-
ing dinner. Instead, I got up 
and went out the door, and I 
walked and walked for a few 
hours, with no particular des-
tination in mind.

It was cold and I forgot a 

jacket. I thought a lot about 

what we, as artists, can do 
about the hatred in the world, 
and worried that perhaps the 
disease had already metasta-
sized, that the sickness was 
fatal. When one wakes up to 
find that Hell is empty, and 
all the devils are here, what’s 
to be done? In terms of both 
music and words, I knew that 
I had to write — it wasn’t just 
an emotional necessity, it was 
a moral imperative. I recalled 
artists who had grappled with 
similar questions in the past, 
and by the time my wander-
ing brought me to Literati I 
already knew exactly the poem 
I had to read.

“ …Uncertain and afraid / As 

the clever hopes expire / Of a 
low dishonest decade / Waves 
of anger and fear / Circulate 
over the bright / And darkened 
lands of the earth, / Obsessing 
our private lives … Accurate 
scholarship can / Unearth the 
whole offence / From Luther 
until now / That has driven 
a culture mad, / Find what 
occurred at Linz, / What huge 
imago made / A psychopathic 
god: / I and the public know / 
What all schoolchildren learn, 
/ Those to whom evil is done / 
Do evil in return … ”

Those lines come from W.H. 

Auden’s “September 1, 1939,” 
a title which references the 
German invasion of Poland, 
and thus the beginning of the 
bloodiest conflict humanity 
has ever known. It’s uncanny 
how apt the words feel still 
— he wrote it in the few days 
following the outbreak of the 
war in Europe, before most of 
the paroxysms of violence had 
shaken the continent, but he 
could see what was to come.

While it was a far darker 

age than today’s epoch when 
Auden wrote it, there are cer-
tain similarities which bear 
consideration. When Auden 
sat down to pen his poem he 
saw a world which was red and 
bleeding, and he wept tears of 
ink, ink which formed itself 
into words and into thoughts. 
And the thoughts that came 
out were beautiful, and heart-
breaking, and accusatory, and 
fearful, and angry, and opti-
mistic and affirmational — and 
ultimately, more than anything 
else, they were deeply, emphat-
ically human.

And maybe that’s what art 

is for. Maybe it’s to remind us 
all of our own humanity, to 
hold a mirror before our face 
and say “See, this is what you 
are.” And sometimes what we 
see might be painful, and it 
might be ugly. We might find 
that we live in a “fun” house, 
and the twisted mirror shows 
us only the worst distortions of 
our character. But by contrast, 
sometimes what we see might 
be beautiful, and as artists part 
of our job is to make that beau-
ty something which is attain-
able. Our job is to bring people 
together into the oneness of 
human existence.

About a year ago, follow-

ing the terror attacks in Paris, 
there was a quote by the great 
conductor and composer Leon-
ard Bernstein which garnered 
a great deal of attention, and I 
feel that in some ways it is apt 
to mention it again now. “This 
will be our reply to violence: 
to make music more intensely, 

more beautifully, more devot-
edly than ever before.” Now, 
Bernstein was originally 
speaking a few days after the 
murder of President John F. 
Kennedy, but his advice is no 
less sage now than it was then. 
Music has the power to gather 
disparate groups together, to 
bridge ravines and to sway the 
hearts and minds of human-
kind.

Composers have been doing 

this in little ways forever — 
there are, of course, the great 
examples of pacifist works of 
the 20th century, such as Ben-
jamin Britten’s “War Requiem” 
and Ralph Vaughan Wil-
liams’s “Dona Nobis Pacem,” 
but even earlier, people were 
doing this. Verdi’s magnificent 
“Requiem” was composed in 
memory of the great Italian 
nationalist poet and novel-
ist Alessandro Manzoni, and 
to bring their young nation 
together in mourning. Chopin 
wrote an etude in solidarity 
with the Polish independence 
movement. Even Beethoven 
— deaf, angry, misanthropic, 
cynical Beethoven — strived 
in his music for peace between 
humankind, and for common 
brotherhood.

Perhaps more famous than 

any other work in the cannon, 
Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” from 
the 9th Symphony (now fit-
tingly the anthem of the Euro-
pean Union) is a plea for unity 
and shared humanity. Schil-
ler’s original poem takes on 
new significance through the 
music, and after living through 
the Napoleonic Wars and hav-
ing his democratic hopes shat-
tered with the failure of the 
French Revolution, Beethoven 
poured his soul and his very 
essence into this last sym-
phony, a masterwork which is 
a breathing testament to the 
endurance of the human spirit, 
one which has resounded 
through centuries.

And so, perhaps in times 

like these, when you start to 
wonder if the Bard was right, 
if life really is, after all, a tale 
told by an idiot, full of sound 
and fury and signifying noth-
ing, the most we can do is to 
cherish our art and to cherise 
one another. In Auden’s words, 
“We must love one another 
or die.” And following his 
example, and that of count-
less others, we must lend our 
voice to the chorus of light, to 
sing more powerfully than the 
noise of hate and darkness. We 
have a voice, and that must be 
enough — the rest is silence.

“All I have is a voice / To 

undo the folded lie, / The 
romantic lie in the brain / Of 
the sensual man-in-the-street 
… And no one exists alone; / 
Hunger allows no choice / To 
the citizen or the police; / We 
must love one another or die.

“Defenceless under the night 

/ Our world in stupor lies; / 
Yet, dotted everywhere, / Iron-
ic points of light / Flash out 
wherever the Just / Exchange 
their messages: / May I, com-
posed like them / Of Eros and 
of dust, / Beleaguered by the 
same / Negation and despair, / 
Show an affirming flame.”

Seriously major spoiler alerts 

in this one.

Tuesday’s election results 

were 
unnerving, 
terrifying 

and revealing. But they weren’t 
particularly shocking. Much 
of rural, white, working class 
America, just about half of 
the voting population, found 
inspiration in President-elect 
Donald Trump, a bombastic 
billionaire from the big city. 
His talk of closing borders and 
ending trade deals, preventing 
an onslaught of unwanted glo-
balism, was acutely appealing 
to a wide segment of the popu-
lation weary from structural 
job losses over the last decades.

But the story of 2016 is not 

Trump’s grip on the rust belt, 
nor is it Democratic presiden-
tial nominee Hillary Clinton’s 
declining appeal to her base. 
The most fundamental story 
from this tumultuous election 
will be the established media 
elite and its growing discon-
nect to the average people.

In Joel and Ethan Coen’s 

brilliant 
1991 
film 
“Barton 

Fink,” the titular character, 
a successful New York play-
wright, moves to Los Angeles 
after securing a Hollywood 
screenwriting job. Barton made 
his name by writing a play that 
depicts the “common man” and 
he’s worried that the move to 
Hollywood will remove him 
from his subjects.

He gets it wrong. After Bar-

ton checks into the Hotel Earle, 
a decrepit establishment with 
wallpaper that slides off to 
reveal slime-covered walls, he 
meets his neighbor, Charlie 
Meadows, by calling the front 
desk to complain about Mead-
ows’s noise. Charlie, angered, 
knocks on Barton’s door and 
the two begin to talk. Charlie, 
an insurance salesman, appears 
delighted to learn that Barton is 
a writer of “the common man.” 
Barton’s fascination is “the life 

of the mind,” he tells Charlie. “I 
could tell you some stories,” the 
jovial giant proclaims, before 
Barton interrupts him: “I’m 
sure you could. And that’s the 
point.”

Silenced, Charlie remains 

close to Barton, but strange 
things start to happen. Barton 
develops writer’s block and 
can’t wrap his head around how 
to write a “wrestling picture.” 
He meets a famous novelist 
and falls for his assistant (and 
mistress), Audrey. After Audrey 
and Barton sleep together, he 
finds himself covered in her 
blood: she’s been murdered. 
Charlie, Barton discovers, is 
not a simple, common man.

Known by the name of “Mad-

man Mundt,” Charlie is a homi-
cidal maniac who shoots and 
decapitates his victims. Charlie 
returns to the hotel as Barton 
is locked to his chair by police 
officers. The hotel hallway 
becomes engulfed in flames as 
Charlie pulls a shotgun on the 
officers and races down the 
hallway, screaming, “I’ll show 
you the life of the mind!” And 
just before Charlie tells Barton 
he paid Barton’s family a visit, 
he points the gun at the offi-
cers, says gleefully, “Heil Hit-
ler,” and pulls the trigger.

This is all exaggeration. Only 

a small (but vocal) minority of 
Trump supporters is anti-Semit-
ic or has a penchant for violence, 
and certainly few if any are serial 
killers. But Charlie’s vengeance 
toward Barton, an elitist who 
silences yet claims to speak for 
the common man, should not go 

unnoticed. There is strong dis-
dain for the elite, those who have 
“made it,” who do not know the 
struggle of day labor, of losing 
their job to competition, of hav-
ing limited skills beyond physi-
cal strength and patience, yet 
who feel free to tell the common 
man what is happening, what is 
true. “The economy is improv-
ing under the Obama admin-
istration,” the media tells the 
modern-day common man (an 
objectively true claim), but he 
doesn’t feel this improvement. 
Their lives are not markedly 
better. And their government 
doesn’t care.

It’s no wonder Clinton won the 

vote of the college educated and 
of the young, who have grown up 
in and rightfully accepted a pro-
foundly changing economy. But 
the older folks, from Wisconsin 
and Ohio and Pennsylvania and 
right here in Michigan, who are 
desperately clinging on to their 
livelihoods as their years slip by, 
have exercised their power. And, 
boy, do they have power.

This is not to say that Trump 

is in the right, or that the “com-
mon” men and women crippled 
by economic anxiety have no 
faults of their own. Often, their 
reactions to immigrants, espe-
cially Latino and Muslim, are 
horrendously 
virulent 
and 

should be rejected on face. But 
this is a nation of coalitions — 
especially the Democratic Party, 
established by the New Deal as a 
melding of populism and elitism. 
That populism has been steadily 
leaving the party since the 1960s 
and it has all but vanished.

Endless ink will be spent 

writing about the 2016 election, 
about how it broke every rule 
in the political theory book and 
yet confirmed what many social 
psychologists believed. But intel-
lectuals and the media, in their 
ivory towers and glass-plated 
skyscrapers, will need to pay 
more attention to our forgotten 
states and people if America is to 
ever survive this catastrophe of 
an election.

Wolverines set for road night game

For the second time this 

season, the Michigan football 
team is headed on the road to play 
a game that 
was 
circled 

on most fans’ 
preseason 
calendars. 
And for the 
second 
time, 

the 
hype 

surrounding 
the 
game 

has 
faded 

considerably.

After Iowa 

raced to a 12-2 
season in 2015, 
including an 8-0 Big Ten regular 
season record, a mid-November 
game at Kinnick Stadium seemed 
make-or-break 
in 
2016. 
But 

while the Hawkeyes (3-3 Big 
Ten, 5-4 overall) are still a real 
threat, the attention that once 
might have been expected has 
dwindled. Iowa has already lost 
games to North Dakota State and 
Northwestern in addition to No. 7 
Wisconsin and No. 10 Penn State.

For Michigan, though, the 

stakes aren’t any lower. The 
third-ranked Wolverines (6-0, 
9-0) have everything to lose 
when they take the field in 
primetime Saturday.

“It makes you prepare that 

much harder because you know 
people are gunning for you,” said 
fifth-year senior defensive tackle 
Ryan Glasgow. “You’re going to 
get everyone’s best shot every 
week. And if you don’t prepare, 
you can easily slip up. Anyone 
in the Big Ten can beat you any 
given Saturday.”

After blowing out Maryland, 

59-3, last week, Michigan should be 
in for a more substantial challenge 
from 
the 
Hawkeyes. 
Senior 

quarterback C.J. Beathard is back 

from last year’s powerhouse, but 
he leads an offense that could 
struggle against the Wolverines’ 
vaunted defense.

Beathard has completed nearly 

60 percent of his passes for 1,584 
yards and 13 touchdowns through 
nine games. That puts him on pace 
to match his 2015 
total of 17 passing 
touchdowns, 
though 
he 

has 
already 

equaled his five 
interceptions 
from last year. 
With an offensive 
line 
that 
has 

given up 24 sacks 
so far this season, 
Beathard 
can 

expect steady pressure all game 
against one of the top pass rushes 
in the country.

Rushing 
the 
ball, 
Akrum 

Wadley leads Iowa’s stable of 
backs and has been a threat both 

rushing and receiving. He has 
664 yards and eight touchdowns 
on the ground, and 220 yards and 
two scores through the air.

The Wolverine defense won’t 

make it easy to keep up those 
numbers. Michigan is ranked 
10th nationally in rush yards 

allowed per game 
(107.44), and it 
rarely 
allows 

ball 
carriers 

to 
score. 
The 

Wolverines 
are 

one of four teams 
tied 
for 
first 

in the country 
with three rush 
touchdowns 
allowed, and they 
boast the nation’s 

best pass defense, too. The result 
could be a mismatch when the 
Hawkeye offense is on the field.

But it’s still a road night 

game, so Michigan is preparing 
for a slugfest.

“(Iowa is a) very tough, physical 

team,” said redshirt sophomore 
linebacker 
Jabrill 
Peppers. 

“When you go up to Iowa City, you 
know they’re going to give you all 
they’ve got. So we’re preparing 
for a tough, physical game, and we 
expect nothing less.”

With 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight and 
the Michigan offense rolling, it 
could be more than the Hawkeyes 
can handle. There is, however, 
one factor Michigan’s young 
players may not be prepared for.

Kinnick’s visiting locker room 

is famously painted pink — a 
psychological trick intended to 
put the opponents in a passive 
mood. 
There 
are 
differing 

theories on the efficacy of such a 
tactic. But according to Glasgow, 
the impact may not be all it’s 
cracked up to be.

“I thought they were going 

to be way more pink,” he said. 
“They’re pretty pale.”

Behind Enemy Lines: 
Coach Kirk Ferentz

Last season, Kirk Ferentz, 

the longest-tenured coach in 
the Big Ten, had one of his best 
seasons yet.

Ferentz, in his 18th season of 

coaching at Iowa, led his team 
to an undefeated record during 
the 2015 regular season. The 
Hawkeyes earned a spot in the 
Rose Bowl, where the Hawkeyes 
were defeated handily, 45-16, 
after losing to Michigan State in 
the Big Ten Championship Game. 

Given their recent success, 

Ferentz and the Hawkeyes (3-3 
Big Ten, 5-4 overall) probably 
couldn’t have predicted the 
drop-off this season. Iowa has 
struggled to a middling 5-4 
record after losing to teams 
like North Dakota State and 
Northwestern 
earlier 
this 

year. Though Iowa is a three-
touchdown underdog against 
Michigan this Saturday, it has 
the opportunity to play at home 
in Kinnick Stadium.

In July, the Daily spoke 

to Ferentz at Big Ten Media 
Days in Chicago about former 
quarterback Jake Rudock and 
playing a night game against 
Michigan.

The Michigan Daily: You’ll 

be hosting Michigan in a night 
game in November. What level 
of intensity do you expect from 
that game?

KF: 
It 
will 
be 
a 
great 

environment. Night games in 
Kinnick are special. Night games 
anywhere are really special. And 
we’re playing a great opponent. A 
rival, a traditional, storied history 
of the program and they’ve got 
an excellent football team, an 
excellent program, so we’re going 
to have a lot of work between now 
and then to get ready for that, but 
we’re eager for it.

TMD: It will be in mid-

November. Do you expect it to be 
pretty cold?

KF: You know, it could be, it 

might not be. It’s interesting. 
Last year, we had a night game, 
I think it was November or 
last weekend of October, and it 
couldn’t have been nicer. Then 
a week later, I thought we were 
on the North Pole. You just never 
know what you’re going to get, 
that’s for sure, in November.

TMD: Jake Rudock probably 

considers himself just as much a 
Hawkeye as he is a Wolverine —

KF: I would say probably 

more so! We got a little more 
time invested in him.

TMD: You did, you did! So 

what was it like to watch him get 
drafted and what do you expect 
out of his future?

KF: I’m really happy for Jake. 

It was hardly a negotiation. It was 
a decision we had to make and 
my obligation has always been to 
what’s the best for our football 
team. It’s like a parent. What’s the 
best for your child involved and 
for the family, et cetera? We made 
a very hard decision and it wasn’t 
necessarily anyone failing. It was 
just two really good players. I think 
history has proven that. We had 
two good players to choose from. 
I can’t say enough about Jake. The 
good thing is that it worked out 
really well for everybody involved. 
Both teams went on and did well. 
Both quarterbacks did great. I was 
hardly surprised.

Jake is a first-class young man. 

He’s a good football player, but 
he’s a better person. Whenever 
his football ends, he has a lot 
of good things waiting for him 
in life. He’s just a tremendous 
young guy. You want everybody 
to be happy. You want everybody 
to be successful. But there’s only 
one ball. Not everyone can share 
it, unfortunately.

Breakdown: Michigan has a significant edge again

Three 
months 
ago, 
this 

weekend’s matchup looked like 
it would be a tough test for the 
Michigan football team. Several 
pundits predicted that the now-
third-ranked Wolverines would 
be a contender this season, but 
most pointed to the upcoming 
matchup with Iowa as one of the 
season’s biggest challenges.

After all, the Hawkeyes won 

the Big Ten West last year and 
fell just a field goal short of 
a likely berth in the College 
Football Playoff, and Michigan 
hasn’t won in Iowa City since 
2005.

The experts were right about 

the Wolverines (6-0 Big Ten, 
9-0 overall), but not about Iowa. 
The Hawkeyes have stumbled to 
a 5-4 record, including a 7-point 
loss to Northwestern, a 27-point 
drubbing by Penn State and a 
23-21 upset by FCS opponent 
North Dakota State.

Michigan is favored by more 

than 20 points, and the talk 
about a close game feels like a 
distant memory. Here’s how the 
matchup looks on paper given 
what we know now:

Michigan rush offense vs. 
Iowa rush defense

After weeks of holding just a 

slight edge over the other three 
backs in the Wolverines’ four-
man rotation, senior running 
back De’Veon Smith exploded for 
114 yards and three touchdowns 
last week against Maryland. 
Though his performance could 
earn him most of the carries 
again this week, the rest of 
Michigan’s backs continue to 
perform well enough to garner 
attention 
— 
redshirt 
junior 

Ty Isaac ripped off a 53-yard 
gain near the end of the game 
Saturday, and freshman Chris 
Evans and sophomore Karan 
Higdon (a former Iowa commit) 
are averaging 8.0 and 7.2 yards 
per carry, respectively.

The Hawkeyes’ run defense, 

meanwhile, doesn’t look like it 
has many answers these days. 

Their flaws were first exposed 
by a 239-yard performance on 
the ground by North Dakota 
State early in the season, and 
the 72nd-best run defense in 
the country hasn’t recovered 
since. Most recently, Nittany 
Lion 
running 
back 
Saquon 

Barkley amassed 207 total yards 
of offense in a 41-14 Penn State 
victory last week.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan pass offense vs. Iowa 
pass defense

Iowa’s 
secondary, 
led 
by 

senior All-American cornerback 
Desmond King, still poses a 
challenge for the Wolverines in 
theory, but the numbers haven’t 
been there this season. Much 
like the Wolverines’ Jourdan 
Lewis, King hasn’t been targeted 
very often, and his teammates 
aren’t holding up their end. The 
low point of the season for the 
secondary actually came in a 
victory, when the Hawkeyes 
allowed 
lowly 
Purdue 
to 

throw for 458 yards and five 
touchdowns. Iowa hasn’t been 
taking the ball away at all, either 
— its five interceptions are tied 
for 101st in the FBS. Last year, 
King alone had eight.

The 
Hawkeyes’ 
struggles 

are coming at the perfect time 
for Michigan’s passing attack, 
which has looked better by 
the week. Redshirt sophomore 
quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

had his best performance of the 
season last week, throwing for 
362 yards and two touchdowns. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
receiver 

Amara Darboh and senior tight 
end Jake Butt have been steady 
all year, and fifth-year senior 
receiver Jehu Chesson showed 
signs of returning to his old form 
with 112 yards and a touchdown 
last week.

Edge: Michigan

Iowa rush offense vs. Michigan 
rush defense

All season long, Iowa has 

gone as far as its ground game 

can take it. The Hawkeyes are 
5-0 in games where they rush 
for over 100 yards and 0-4 in 
games where they are held under 
that mark. Their two rotating 
backs, junior Akrum Wadley and 
senior LeShun Daniels Jr., have 
lit up opponents like Purdue and 
Minnesota, but they combined 
for just 46 yards against the 
Nittany Lions last week. In part 
due to predictable playcalling, 
Iowa has been unable to get 
anything going on the ground 
against above-average defenses.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

would 
certainly 
fit 
in 
that 

category, ranking 10th in the 
country in rush yards allowed 
per 
game. 
That 
number 

worsened, though, thanks to 
Michigan State running back LJ 
Scott, who accounted for 139 of 
the Spartans’ 217 rushing yards 
against Michigan two weeks ago. 
The Wolverines also had some 
trouble with Maryland’s running 
backs on screen passes last week, 
allowing a few big plays.

If 
the 
Hawkeyes’ 
offense 

continues to tip its hand, though, 
Michigan’s front seven has too 
much experience and talent not 
to take advantage of it.

Edge: Michigan

Iowa pass offense vs. Michigan 
pass defense

Iowa 
quarterback 
C.J. 

Beathard is one of the more 
talented quarterbacks in the 
Big Ten, but he could be in 
for a long night Saturday. He 
has been sacked 24 times this 
season, more frequently than 
all but eight quarterbacks in the 
FBS. The Wolverines’ defense 
has a proven ability to get to 
quarterbacks — just three of 
nine starting quarterbacks have 
played complete games against 
Michigan so far this season.

Even if Beathard has enough 

time to get his throws off, there 
aren’t a lot of great places to put 
them. Lewis hasn’t been targeted 
very often in the secondary this 
season, and for good reason — 
he’s allowed just four catches 
and has two interceptions. His 

counterpart on the other side, 
senior Channing Stribling, has 
been nearly as effective, allowing 
just 11 catches and snagging 
three picks of his own.

The Hawkeyes don’t appear to 

have the weapons to attack shut-
down corners — go-to receiver 
Riley McCarron is their only 
player with over 300 receiving 
yards.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Of all the phases of the game, 

this is the most likely chance 
for Iowa to make an impact. 
The Hawkeyes’ special teams 
unit ranks eighth in the country 
in 
special 
teams 
efficiency, 

according 
to 
ESPN, 
while 

Michigan clocks in at 13th. The 
Wolverines have the luxury of 
using Jabrill Peppers on returns, 
but Desmond King is almost just 
as electric for the Hawkeyes. 
He’s averaging 29.2 yards a kick 
return, with a long of 77 yards, 
and according to Michigan tight 
ends/assistant 
special 
teams 

coach Jay Harbaugh, he has 
a knack for making the first 
defender miss.

As for the kicking units, 

the two teams are essentially 
even. The Wolverines’ senior 
kicker/punter, 
Kenny 
Allen, 

has shaken off his early-season 
struggles, riding six straight 
made field goals and averaging 
42.1 yards a punt. Iowa kicker 
Keith Duncan hasn’t had much 
work this season, but he is 6-for-
7 on field goal attempts, while 
long-distance specialist Miguel 
Rescinos 
is 
1-for-2 
on 
two 

40-plus-yard kicks.

Edge: Iowa

Intangibles

With just three regular-season 

games left and an undefeated 
record, Michigan has everything 
to lose. Iowa, though, has already 
fallen well short of its preseason 
expectations — the best it can 
hope for now is to win one of its 
last three games to secure bowl 
eligibility.

Despite their success, the 

Wolverines haven’t faced much 
adversity on the road this 
season. They won at Rutgers 
and 
Michigan 
State, 
but 

both stadiums featured large 
contingents of Michigan fans 
and struggling opponents who 
couldn’t 
take 
advantage 
on 

home turf.

Kinnick Stadium remains a 

tough place to play, especially for 
Michigan over the past decade. 
In 2009, the Wolverines , then 
4-1, lost a two-point game at 
night to the Hawkeyes, and their 
season spun out of control from 
there. Even in 2011 — the year 
Michigan went 11-2 and won the 
Sugar Bowl — the Wolverines 
suffered an eight-point loss at 
Iowa.

The Hawkeyes clearly aren’t 

the team some thought they 
might be at the beginning of the 
year, but this has “trap game” 
written all over it if Michigan 
isn’t careful.

What to Watch For: Iowa

The spotlight has shone on 

the Michigan football team all 
season, and this Saturday, the 
bright lights of Kinnick Stadium 
will, too.

As prevalent as the Wolverines 

have been all season, they have 
played only one night game, Oct. 
8 at Rutgers, in one of the most 
lopsided games in college football 
this year. This week, Michigan 
gets a true prime-time treatment 
with an 8 p.m. kickoff at Iowa (3-3 
Big Ten, 5-4 overall) on ABC’s 
Saturday Night Football.

The eyes of many have been on 

the third-ranked Wolverines (6-0, 
9-0) since September, but now, 
in the final quarter of the season, 
the pressure ramps up even more. 
Michigan will again enter the game 
as a heavy favorite, and its opponent 
will be searching for an upset.

In this series, the Hawkeyes 

have had the edge recently. They 
have won four of the past five 
meetings, the first two against 
Rich 
Rodriguez’s 
struggling 

Michigan 
teams. 
They 
also 

handed Brady Hoke’s first team 
one of its two losses in 2011 in 
Iowa City, and they knocked off 
the Wolverines again in 2013. The 
teams have not played since.

Here’s what to watch for when 

they battle again Saturday:

1. How does Michigan start 
the game?

The Wolverines have been 

dominant for almost all 60 
minutes in their games this 
season, but they have struggled at 
times in the first series or two. On 
offense, they started the season 
with an interception on their first 
play, and punted in under two 
minutes on each of their next four 
first drives. They did not score on 
an opening series until Week 7, 
though they have done so in every 
week since.

On defense, Michigan has been 

stifling for the most part, but it has 
cracked in the earlygoing a couple 
of times. Against Michigan State, 
LJ Scott and the Spartans’ ground 
game rolled over the Wolverines in 
eight plays covering 80 yards, and 
even last week against Maryland, 
the Terrapins possessed the ball 
for almost four minutes.

Michigan has given up just 11 

offensive touchdowns all season, 
but two have come on the first 
drive. Iowa’s best chance to win 
Saturday is to score a third, gain 
some momentum and keep it. 
If the Hawkeyes can’t establish 
themselves early, the Wolverines 
can coast.

2. What’s Iowa’s game plan?

In 
the 
past 
two 
weeks, 

Michigan State and Maryland 
have 
at 
least 
given 
future 

Michigan opponents a few tips on 
how to move the ball against the 
Wolverines. The Spartans tried 
the ground game, as Scott carried 
22 times for 139 of the team’s 217 

rushing yards. Then, Maryland 
had some success through the air, 
passing for 289 yards last week.

Both 
of 
those 
strategies 

involved 
getting 
playmakers 

into space on outside runs or 
flat passes to try to avoid the 
teeth 
of 
Michigan’s 
defense. 

It’ll be interesting to see which 
route Iowa takes. The Hawkeyes 
don’t have many of the open-
field threats that the past two 
opponents had — they rely more 
on winning the battle up front and 
pounding the ball between the 
tackles, a tactic the Wolverines 
typically stifle.

Either way, that matchup may 

decide the game. Iowa is 5-0 this 
season when rushing for at least 
100 yards and 0-4 when missing 
that mark. In the past two weeks, 
the Hawkeyes have totaled just 
113 yards on the ground and lost to 
Wisconsin and Penn State. Iowa 
also ranks 104th in the country 
in third-down conversions — a 
bad recipe against Michigan’s 
top-ranked defense — so if the 
Hawkeyes can’t figure out a way 
to make those situations more 
manageable with runs on first and 
second down, they’ll struggle.

3. Can Wilton Speight have his 
fourth straight best game of 
the season?

After 
last 
week’s 
rout 
of 

Maryland, Speight is officially 
rolling. In just the first half 
Saturday, he was 13-for-16 for 292 
yards and two touchdowns. He has 
also somewhat quietly put together 
a touchdown-interception ratio of 
15-to-3. Because of their defense, 
the Wolverines haven’t needed 
him to do a ton. That could change 
in the final quarter of the season 
as Michigan travels to Iowa and 
Ohio State and hosts Indiana in 
between.

This might be Speight’s toughest 

test yet, too. The Hawkeyes rank 
just 62nd in the country in passing 
defense, but they have been 
consistent except for a 49-35 win 
at Purdue last month in which 
they gave up 458 yards through 
the air. Iowa should bring its best 
performance for a home night 
game at Kinnick Stadium.

Michigan’s schedule has been 

kind to Speight so far, with only 
one trip outside the state in the 
first nine games. That was a road 
night game, but it was also a 
78-0 victory at Rutgers in which 
Speight played only the first half 
and was never tested.

4. Which Detroit star shines 
brighter?

For just the second time in their 

college careers, Michigan senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis and 
Iowa senior cornerback Desmond 
King will face off on the field. But 
the history between the two goes 
back to their high school days, 
when Lewis starred at Detroit 
Cass Tech and King led Detroit 
Crockett and then East English 
Village Prep.

Both 
players 
earned 
All-

American honors last season, and 
both saw the field as freshmen 
when 
the 
Wolverines 
and 

Hawkeyes last played in 2013. King 
edged Lewis on the stat sheet (three 
tackles and two pass breakups 
versus two tackles) and on the 
scoreboard (Iowa won, 24-21). 
Since then, both have had much 
more success, becoming two of the 
best cornerbacks in the nation.

Lewis, who often talks about 

his playing days at Cass Tech, still 
remembers their earlier meetings, 
such as Crockett’s two victories in 
the matchup in 2011. He and King 
will have plenty of opportunities 
to make the final statement in 
the last collegiate edition of their 
rivalry Saturday.

Michigan gears up for BU

Two weeks ago, the No. 18 

Michigan hockey team kicked 
off its schedule away from 
home on the East Coast, where 
it recorded losses to Vermont 
and Dartmouth. Last week, the 
Wolverines completely switched 
gears on the opposite end of the 
country, tallying a win against 
Arizona State, 4-1.

With a 4-3-1 record in tow, the 

Wolverines will return home this 
weekend to battle No. 4 Boston 
University in a pair of home 
games Friday and Saturday for 
their second Autism Awareness 
series in program history.

The Terriers boast a 4-2-1 

record for the season so far, 
almost identical to Michigan, save 
for a single loss. However, Boston 
possesses one of the strongest 
defensive and offensive rosters in 
the nation with four first-round 
NHL Entry Draft picks.

“Their defense, they don’t give 

you much,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “Their goalie, I 
think he had three shutouts in 
a row, a kid named Oettinger. 
We recruited him and he went 
to Boston. And he’s gotten 
better, he’s off to a good start, 
he’s a freshman goalie from the 
program. (Freshman forward 
Will Lockwood) played with 
him last year. So, their defense is 
a challenge.

“Their defense will be good, 

and their offense, they’ve got two 
top lines that can score. They’re 
way ahead of us in scoring. And 
those guys are leading the way, 
so we’ve really got to be aware of 
their good players.”

One 
of 
those 
players 
is 

freshman forward Clayton Keller, 
who was just named Hockey East 
Rookie of the Week. He leads the 
Terriers in scoring with five goals 
and is second in points with nine. 
He falls behind only freshman 
forward Patrick Harper, who has 
tallied 11 points so far this season.

In goal, Boston is likely to start 

Jake Oettinger in front of the net. 
So far this season, he’s played in all 
seven of the Terriers’ games, and 
he has a save percentage of .941.

But even with two top scoring 

lines saddled with players like 
Keller and Harper, and a defense 
led by Oettinger, Boston will 
still face a challenge against the 
Wolverines.

Lockwood, who played with 

Oettinger in the United States 
National 
Team 
Development 

Program, is leading Michigan in 
goals and points with five and 
eight, respectively. This number 
also ties him at third for rookies 
in NCAA Division I hockey and 
puts him in a good matchup 
against Keller.

Freshman 
forwards 
Sam 

Piazza and Jake Slaker have 
both 
scored 
the 
second-

highest number of goals for the 
Wolverines with three each, 
while Piazza is also following 
Lockwood in points with seven.

Overall, the Wolverines will 

have a tough weekend ahead. 
Boston’s 
heavy 
roster 
and 

highlighted players will pose 
a serious threat to Michigan, 
despite 
Lockwood’s 
presence 

on the ice and the Wolverines’ 
depth in the goaltender position. 
The Terriers have had success 
in suppressing their opponent’s 
offense 
and 
capitalizing 
on 

opportunities, 
averaging 
3.9 

goals per game and limiting their 
opponents to only 1.7.

It’ll be an uphill battle for 

Michigan. Despite the challenge 
Boston 
poses, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines will be fueled by the 
opportunity to beat a team ranked 
as highly as the Terriers.

“We’re working on things to 

be better,” said Berenson. “We 
don’t just work on the opponent, 
we’re working on us. We’ve got 
to be better at whatever it is. I 
think we’re building our game, 
but we know the game that we’re 
going to need when we play them. 
Tomorrow we’ll put it all together.”

Kieffer-Wright shows athleticism, 
sparks Michigan against Indiana

After finishing the first set 

on an 8-2 run and starting the 
second on a similar streak, 
the Michigan volleyball team 
saw its momentum evaporate 
midway 
through 
the 
set. 

Indiana had climbed back 
to take a 10-9 lead, and the 
Wolverines needed a spark.

Enter Claire Kieffer-Wright.
The junior middle blocker 

came up with a kill after a 
lengthy 
rally, 
kick-starting 

Michigan to a 6-0 run in which 
Kieffer-Wright registered two 
blocks and two kills. It was 
sequences such as this one 
that defined the contest for the 
Wolverines. Whenever they 
needed someone to step up 
and make an impact, Kieffer-
Wright was there.

“We just realized that we 

can’t wait for Indiana to lose,” 
Kieffer-Wright said. “We have 
to come out there and we have 
to attack them. We were out for 
blood the whole night.”

Overall, 
Kieffer-Wright 

registered 12 kills, 7 blocks and 
an attack percentage of .421 
in No. 17 Michigan’s three-
set sweep of Indiana. Her 
athleticism and energy has 
been vital for the Wolverines, 
as coach Mark Rosen stated 
that they are somewhat lacking 
in those categories.

“She uses her athleticism 

really well,” Rosen said. “She’s 
fast, she’s really explosive 
off one foot, and in the last 
couple weeks she’s been really 
producing a lot offensively 
because of that speed.”

This description shouldn’t 

be surprising to those familiar 
with the Michigan women’s 
track and field team, as Kieffer-
Wright stars as a high jumper 
for the Wolverines in the 

spring. But Rosen also touted 
her impact beyond just her 
physical qualities or statistics.

“(Her contribution) is not 

only the points she’s scoring 
and her athleticism, but her 
personality,” 
Rosen 
said. 

“She’s super competitive, fiery 
— whenever she gets a kill, 
there’s an emotional charge 
from that. We talk a lot in 
our program about producers 
versus consumers, and she’s 
constantly producing in every 
way that she 
can.”

All 
season 

long, 
Rosen 

has 
been 

impressed 
with 
his 

team’s 
next-

person-up 
mentality, 
and 
the 

potential 
for 

any one player 
to be dominant any game. 
Wednesday 
night, 
it 
was 

Kieffer-Wright’s turn.

Dominating from the start, 

she scored the first point of 
the match on a kill, and she 
registered another after the 
Hoosiers 
had 
jumped 
out 

to the next five points. The 
timeliness of her contributions 
was of great importance as 
well, especially in the second 
set. 
After 
powering 
the 

Wolverines’ 
surge 
midway 

through the set, she combined 
with senior outside hitter Kelly 
Murphy on a block to finish off 
the set and send the match to 
intermission.

The 
previous 
meeting 

between Michigan and Indiana 
resulted 
in 
disappointment 

for 
the 
Wolverines, 
as 

they 
returned 
home 
from 

Bloomington on Oct. 29 with 
a 3-1 loss. In that match, they 
allowed the Hoosiers’ middle 

blockers to control the game. 
On 
Wednesday, 
Kieffer-

Wright and the Wolverines’ 
other middle blocker, senior 
Abby Cole, were able to almost 
completely flip that script.

“One of our main points 

this week in practice that we 
worked on with (the Hoosiers) 
in mind was serving and 
getting them off balance,” 
Kieffer-Wright said. “We were 
really capitalizing on blocking 
their middles.”

With 

Michigan’s 
relative 
deficiency 
in 
athletic 

ability, it may 
have to rely 
on 
Kieffer-

Wright 
more 

and 
more, 

especially 
heading 
into 

one of its most 

challenging stretches of the 
season. To close out the regular 
season, the Wolverines will 
face the top three teams in the 
nation — Nebraska, Minnesota 
and Wisconsin, respectively 
— and will also meet No. 15 
Michigan State twice.

“We gotta continue to get 

better against teams that bring 
speed,” Rosen said. “We’re 
going to see that against 
Minnesota, 
they’re 
faster 

than Indiana and Indiana’s 
really fast. ... Michigan State’s 
probably one of the top five or 
six (most physical) teams in 
the country. They’re just big, 
and they’ll get after you.”

Coming off of a strong recent 

stretch 
of 
performances, 

Kieffer-Wright 
adds 
an 

important 
and 
different 

definition to the Wolverines. 
As they continue to grow 
as a team, she might be the 
embodiment of this evolution.

Junior middle blocker sparked Wolverines with crucial 
run, 12 kills, seven blocks in Wednesday sweep of Indiana

After an offseason of turnover, the Michigan men’s basketball team 
hopes to reestablish itself as a contender in a stacked Big Ten and 
beyond. Coach John Beilein lost five key contributors to graduation and 
transfers and two assistants to other head coaching jobs. But a wave of 
new faces and ideas have kept optimism up in the hallways of Crisler 
Center. Seniors Derrick Walton Jr. and Zak Irvin have one final season to 
cement their legacies as they and three other returning starters as the 
Wolverines target a sixth NCAA Tournament berth in seven years. 


Recreating the two-headed monster

T

he 1991-92 season was a 
good year for Michigan 
athletics.

In the fall, the football team, 

led by eventual 
Heisman 
Award-winning 
wide receiver 
Desmond 
Howard, 
marched 
through the 
regular season, 
losing just 
once to No. 1 
Florida State. 
The 10-1 regular season earned 
the Wolverines a bid to the Rose 
Bowl, where they lost to eventual 
national champion Washington.

As the football team was 

wrapping up a successful season 
under Gary Moeller, five freshmen 
were getting ready to change the 
landscape of college basketball.

The Fab Five arrived in 1991 and 

electrified college basketball with 
their high-flying dunks, baggy 
shorts and trash talk. Their rough 
style of play startled the rest of 
the sport’s realm and led them to 
a National Championship game 
appearance, where they lost to 
Duke, 71-51.

That was the last time both the 

football and basketball teams had 
an insurmountable amount of hype 
around their respective programs 
at the same time, creating a two-
headed monster of Michigan 
athletics. Since then, the two 
teams have teetered back and forth 
in their successes.

And that has been especially 

true for myself as a near-sighted 
observer.

As an out-of-state student 

from California, Michigan sports 
haven’t always piqued my interest. 
While I watched the occasional 
Michigan football game, I can’t say 
I ever put time aside to invest in 
Michigan athletics.

But I really started to pay 

attention around October of 2012 
— my senior year of high school — 
when I decided that I would apply 
to the University.

I vividly remember following 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team that year. From watching 
the top-ranked Wolverines 
narrowly lose to No. 3 Indiana 
in Bloomington, to watching 
Wisconsin’s Ben Brust drain 

a near-half-court shot to 
force overtime in Madison on 
SportsCenter and, of course, to 
watching Michigan make it to the 
NCAA Championship game, which 
culminated in an 82-76 loss to 
Louisville in Atlanta.

On the flip side, while the 

football team had gone to the Sugar 
Bowl the year prior, the squad had 
just wrapped up an average 8-5 
season in Brady Hoke’s second year.

And the trend followed me to 

Ann Arbor. The basketball team 
won the regular-season Big Ten title 
my freshman year and was an Aaron 
Harrison 3-pointer away from 
another Final Four appearance, 
while the football team slugged its 
way to a 7-6 season.

But situations change — and 

pretty quickly.

Just two years later, all the 

talk around campus is about Jim 
Harbaugh and the football team 
— and for good measure, the team 
has executed a perfect season thus 
far — while the basketball team, 
albeit having some success, has 
taken a back seat.

That can change, though. While 

the basketball team might not be 

able to overtake the football team 
in Ann Arbor, where the gridiron 
has always been king, it might be 
able to at least reach the same level.

Though it’s never a guarantee 

how a team might perform, the 
Michigan basketball team has 
some of the ingredients necessary 
for a great season. This is what will 
factor most into this season’s hype:

After finishing the 2015-16 

season ranked a putrid No. 322 in 
the NCAA in average rebounds per 
game, Michigan will need to assert 
more authority in the paint on 
both ends of the court. Last season, 
senior guard Derrick Walton Jr., 
standing at just 6-foot-1, led the 
Wolverines in rebounds. That stat 
won’t fly this season, and Michigan 
will need to see more paint presence 
from its bigs in sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner and redshirt junior 
Mark Donnal.

Speaking of Walton, he and 

senior guard Zak Irvin have been 
key contributors throughout their 
three years of college so far.

This year, however, is a little 

different. Not only will Walton 
and Irvin be looked upon to 
perform well on the court, the 

two are also now the oldest 
members on the team and the last 
players remaining from the last 
time Michigan won the Big Ten 
regular-season title in 2014. How 
well the two handle high-pressure 
situations on the court could 
indicate the outcome of the season.

While the Wolverines fared a 

bit better in team defense, ending 
the season at No. 67 in the NCAA, 
there’s still room to improve. Last 
season, there was a clear gap in 
defensive prowess between Walton 
and Irvin and the rest of the team. 
And even then, the duo’s defense 
was not up to par.

But after the departures of 

assistant coaches LaVall Jordan and 
Bacari Alexander, who both left 
Michigan to pursue head coaching 
careers at Milwaukee and Detroit-
Mercy, respectively, Beilein brought 
in assistant coach Billy Donlon.

Donlon last coached at Wright 

State and is known for his defensive 
tactics, which at one point put 
the Rowdy Raiders in the top 20 
in the NCAA in scoring defense. 
Beilein has repeated multiple times 
already that he is giving Donlon a 
great deal of responsibility with the 

defense, a strategy that should pay 
off almost immediately.

And last, while the starting 

lineup seems to be set, team depth 
is still a big question mark after 
the departure of five players over 
the summer.

Beilein has said that, ideally, he 

would run an eight-man rotation. 
This means that players like 
Donnal, freshman guards Xavier 
Simpson and Ibi Watson and 
redshirt sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson will be relied on heavily 
to give the starters a breather. If 
they can spot the starters for 12 to 
15 minutes a night, it could prove 
vital down the stretch come NCAA 
Tournament time.

And to not only reach the NCAA 

Tournament, but also do well in it, 
would go a long way to recreating 
the scene from 1991. While it may 
be a stretch, the fact of the matter 
is that the Wolverines have the 
pieces in place to make it possible.

Now Michigan just has to go 

and do it.

On Nov. 8, 2013, Michigan hung a 

banner from the rafters.

It was Walton’s college debut, and 

he took his spot in line alongside his 
14 teammates during the national 
anthem. For the majority of them, the 
banner signified fulfillment, a lasting 
commemoration of the Wolverines 
run to the NCAA Tournament 
championship the season prior.

For Walton, it was a symbol of 

what he expected his future to hold.

“Walking into it, there was just so 

much going on, and it was so fun and 
the excitement was just through the 
roof,” Walton said at Big Ten Media 
Day. “I remember saying to myself, 
like, ‘This is definitely what it’s all 
about and how it is.’ ”

But with the banner also came 

expectations. 
From 
the 
outside 

looking in, Walton was meant to 
carry the torch Trey Burke had left 
for him. Both were point guards. 
Both were 6-foot-1. Both could 

handle the ball and shoot. It was an 
easy comparison.

Those on the outside were dead 

wrong. His coaches didn’t want him 
to emulate the former Naismith 
Award winner. His teammates didn’t 
either. And Walton just wanted to 
play his own game, too.

“Derrick knew he wasn’t Trey 

Burke,” said his father, Derrick 
Walton Sr. “Everybody said their 
game was similar, but Derrick is 
actually a true point guard. He just 
wanted to be Derrick Walton, he 

didn’t want to be Trey Burke.”

Added 2013 center Jordan Morgan: 

“Early on, we made it known that we 
didn’t expect him to be Trey Burke. 
We didn’t necessarily expect him to 
lead us back to where we were the 
year before. He would be a piece of 
it, but we had a lot of experience in 
place already from that run. And we 
just wanted him to come in and be 
Derrick Walton.”

His freshman year, he got the 

chance to do just that. Walton just 
wanted to work. He expected to arrive 
in Ann Arbor having to compete 
for time with the 
man people tried 
to compare him to. 
But Burke went to 
the NBA, leaving 
Walton to take over 
the reins. 

Immediately, 

he ran an offense 
that 
featured 

future NBA draft 
picks Nik Stauskas, 
Mitch 
McGary, 

Caris LeVert and Glenn Robinson III. 
He didn’t need to carry the team. He 
just needed to facilitate.

While Burke starred from the 

point, Walton came in ready to defer 
the spotlight. In high school, he had 
been Michigan’s Gatorade Player 
of the Year, the runner-up for Mr. 
Basketball 
of 
Michigan 
(behind 

current Big 12 preseason player of 
the year Monte Morris) and a Parade 
All-American during his senior year.

As a freshman, Walton started 

every game at point guard except 
one, helping to lead the Wolverines 
to their first outright Big Ten 
Championship 
since 
1986. 
The 

Wolverines rolled on to the Elite 
Eight, and save for a 3-pointer by 
Kentucky’s Aaron Harrison with 2.3 
seconds left to play, Walton would 
have been starting at point guard as a 
true freshman in the Final Four, too.

In that moment, Walton got to 

taste what all the hype was about.

Yet as soon as he tasted it, it was 

gone.

Entering his sophomore year, 

Michigan dealt with the departures 
of Morgan, Robinson III, McGary, 
Stauskas and Jon Horford. Still, the 
Wolverines seemed to have enough 
pieces in place to contend.

Quickly, though, those pieces 

started to crumble.

In the fifth game of the season, 

Michigan took the floor against then-
No. 14 Villanova. By the end of the 
first half, Walton had picked up a toe 
injury that would eventually end his 
season — even if he didn’t know it yet.

He played through the pain, 

laboring over 14 games after the 
matchup with the Wildcats. Two 
days after losing Caris LeVert for the 
season to a fractured foot, Walton put 
forth a 40-minute, 17-point effort in a 
69-64 loss to then-No. 6 Wisconsin 
on Jan. 24. He hit the 3-pointer that 
sent the game into overtime. But it 
turned out to be the final game of his 

sophomore season, as 
his year ended with a 
foot injury after the 
matchup 
with 
the 

Badgers. 

“I could tell that 

really 
hurt 
him, 

having to sit on the 
sidelines and watch, 
especially as we were 
really struggling my 
junior 
year,” 
said 

former 
Michigan 

guard Spike Albrecht. “He had been 
on a team a year before who won a 
Big Ten championship and went to 
the Elite Eight.

“I think him sitting on the 

sidelines and wishing he could be 
out there, knowing that he could 
help, but he couldn’t play due to 
his injury, I could tell that really 
bothered him. You could see it every 
day in practice, how bad he just 
wanted to be out there.”

Faced with watching from the 

sidelines as the Wolverines missed 
the Big Dance for the first time in 
five years, Walton found comfort in 
his faith.

“I think it gave me a great deal 

of humility,” Walton said. “It made 
me tap into my own personal faith 
and take things for what it’s worth. 
These last two seasons definitely 
opened my eyes to broader things 
than just basketball.

“…I was on the track to do some 

things that I thought I could do and 
you know, the injury happened. As 
a person that believes in a higher 
power, I just think there are things 
that happen for a reason.”

He would get the chance at 

another fresh start. But adversity 
reared its ugly head once more.

Walton’s last ride

“I just think 

there are things 

that happen for 

a reason.”

returning to the NCAA Tournament. 

Zak Irvin began the year with a 

back surgery in September, and was 
never quite himself despite returning 
in time for the season. LeVert’s 
464 minutes were an overestimate 
of the impact he could have on 
the program. Albrecht completed 
the 
trifecta 
— 

announcing on Dec. 
11 that he would 
end 
his 
Michigan 

career to focus on 
recovering 
from 

bilateral hip surgery 
he underwent in the 
offseason.

Suddenly 

Michigan 
was 

without 
its 
two 

marquee seniors, the 
last remnants of a class that was 
dubbed the “Fresh Five.”

It was that same class that had 

set the bar Walton’s career has been 
measured by. Now its last traces 
were 
ending 
prematurely, 
and 

Walton was the one left to fill the 
leadership void.

He always wanted to lead by 

example. He hadn’t been as willing 
to be vocal. But now, he had no 
choice.

“I just always said, ‘Yeah Derrick, 

well, your roommates are down. You 
have to step up a little, bro,” Walton 
Sr. said. “ ‘…You’re just going to have 
to be the leader right now. They’re 
hurt and you just got to do what 
you’re supposed to do. You have the 
ball in your hand 90 percent of the 
time, but you have to go ahead and 

open your mouth a little bit.’ ”

There 
were 
moments 
when 

Walton wondered how the team 
could be so hampered by injury, how 
it could be so unlucky. It had never 
crossed his mind that the injuries 
would pile up.

“Like I said, (it) just gives you 

a different type of 
perspective on life,” 
Walton said. “Just 
makes you appreciate 
and try and get the 
most out of every day. 
That’s pretty much 
where I’m at right 
now.

“I just try to attack 

each 
and 
every 

opportunity I’m given, 
and at the end of the 

day, I think the chips will fall where 
the may, and at the end of the day, I’m 
going to be where I need to be.”

Now, Walton has a team equipped 

to 
make 
another 
run 
in 
the 

postseason. He, Irvin and a host of 
others make up a group without one 
true star, but with all the necessary 
ability to succeed.

Maybe more importantly, Walton 

has one last season to stamp his 
legacy on this program. And a large 
part of that will reveal itself in the 
standard he sets for younger players. 
One of those players is a freshman 
point guard named Xavier Simpson. 
He starred in high school, and 
now, he’ll be asked to step in and 
make an immediate impact on the 
Wolverines.

Perhaps that sounds familiar.

game-winning 3-pointer.

Position-by-position breakdown: Youth, 
experience come together for Wolverines

A summer and preseason where 

all attention and focus could be 
put on the court rather than on the 
training table couldn’t have come 
at a better time for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

Michigan coach John Beilein, for 

the first time in recent years, was 
able to work with his entire squad 
with little to no distractions from 
injuries through the summer. With a 
roster that a brings a mix of veteran 
experience and youthful talent, 
Beilein needed that health to bring 
the Wolverines together as they 
seek their sixth NCAA Tournament 
appearance in seven years.

While 
there 
was 
major 

personnel 
turnover 
in 
the 

offseason — the Wolverines lost 
Caris LeVert to graduation and 
Spike 
Albrecht, 
Ricky 
Doyle, 

Aubrey Dawkins and Kameron 
Chatman to transfers — Michigan 
returns the starting five that fell 
to Notre Dame in the round of 
64 of the NCAA Tournament. In 
addition, the Wolverines have 
brought in four freshmen who will 
be expected to contribute at high 
levels early in their careers.

With many old faces and some 

new, the Daily breaks down 
Michigan’s roster:

Guards

Senior guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. 
will 
undoubtedly 
be 
the 

Wolverines’ vocal and emotional 
leader. The 6-foot-1 point guard 
is coming off his best season in 
Ann Arbor, averaging 11.6 points 
and 5.4 rebounds per game last 
year while also tallying career 
highs in assists and steals. Walton 
will be expected to surpass those 
numbers this season, especially in 
scoring, as he will be sharing the 
responsibilities at the point with 
freshman Xavier Simpson and 
playing at the ‘2’ more.

Junior guard Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman, 
Michigan’s 

most improved player a season 
ago, is hoping to build off the 
momentum he found in conference 
play. Abdur-Rahkman ended up 
starting 25 games due to LeVert’s 

injury, and grew more confident 
in his role in every appearance. 
The 6-foot-4 guard ended up 
shooting 45 percent from the field 
and 37 percent from behind the 
arc, and may be heavily relied on 
when Michigan needs points in 
a hurry. As the Wolverines’ only 
true shooting guard, if Abdur-
Rahkman finds himself in foul 
trouble or out with an injury, 
Beilein may need to call upon 
Walton, senior guard Zak Irvin 
or redshirt junior guard Duncan 
Robinson to fill in temporarily at 
the ‘2.’

Simpson will also be a boost for 

Michigan’s guard rotation coming 
off the bench. The 6-foot guard 
won’t feature as a prominent 
scorer but has the explosiveness 
and vision that will open up other 
options on the court. Beilein is 
keen to play Simpson and Walton 

together, with the freshman at 
the point, when Michigan needs 
to push tempo and be quicker on 
defense. Look for Simpson to post 
numbers similar to those Walton 
contributed his freshman year — 
averaging eight points and three 
assists — while playing 20 minutes 
each game.

Wings

Irvin is going to have to bounce 

back from a disappointing junior 
year in a big way. The 6-foot-6 
senior shot just 30 percent from 
deep and saw over a two-point 
drop in his scoring average. Unlike 
last year, when he underwent a 
summer back procedure, Irvin 
had the entire off-season to 
prepare and train. The Wolverines 
expect his 3-point percentage to 
return to somewhere around his 

career average of 36 percent along 
with growth in other areas of his 
game as well. The question still 
persists if Irvin can live up to the 
potential he’s shown in flashes 
throughout his career. It’ll come 
down to his final season to prove 
than he can be the guy Beilein can 
rely on to consistently find points 
for Michigan.

After establishing himself in 

his first season in Ann Arbor, 
Robinson will aspire to become 
more than a deep threat. Beilein 
hopes the 6-foot-8 guard can not 
only continue to shoot 45 percent 
from behind the arc, but also drive 
to the basket and be more physical 
on offense. Of the 134 field goals 
Robinson made last season, 95 
of them were 3-pointers. The 
Wolverines need that proportion 
to shrink, or Beilein believes 
Robinson will be too predictable 

and guarded too heavily on the 
perimeter. Michigan also expects 
Robinson’s 
defensive 
abilities 

to improve from a year ago. 
The senior showed weaknesses 
while guarding opponents and 
rebounding, and the Wolverines 
hope a summer in the weight 
room will help Robinson out-
muscle opponents and improve 
his quickness while guarding 
perimeter players as well.

Freshman forward Ibi Watson 

will give Michigan something 
different off the bench. The 6-foot-
5 freshman looked sharp in the 
Wolverines’ 
exhibition 
against 

Armstrong State, scoring seven 
points on 3-for-8 shooting while 
leading the team with three steals. 
Irvin and Robinson have had issues 
defensively in the past. If Watson 
can prove to be less of a liability 
than his teammates were, he could

The Michigan men’s basketball team will be looking for one of its many forwards to emerge as a difference maker in the post early in the 2016-17 season.

see a rise in minutes.

Flying under the radar as a 

potential major contributor at 
the ‘4’ is redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson. Averaging 
six minutes per game, the 6-foot-
10 forward was used sparingly 
last season and was often seen 
as a rebounding liability. After 
a healthy offseason, Wilson is 
stronger than ever and more 
willing to crash the boards 
and get the Wolverines the 
rebounds they may desperately 
need. 
Wilson 
could 
feature 

prominently in Big Ten play as 
he matches up better with some 
of the taller teams in the league 
and is a more traditional power 
forward than anyone else on the 
roster.

Post

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner’s summer in the gym 
looks like it has won him 
the starting role over senior 
forward 
Mark 
Donnal. 
The 

work the 6-foot-10 sophomore 
put in showed in his 15-point 
performance over the Pirates 
on Friday, as Wagner showed 
off his improved offensive skills 
and understanding of the system. 
Wagner still may have issues on 
the defensive end though. Last 
season he wasn’t boxing out 
and constantly found himself 

in foul trouble. Beilein hopes 
his improved strength will help 
Wagner overcome his defensive 
problems, but for now, Michigan 
will be relying on the forward’s 
offensive promise to make up for 
his defensive liabilities.

The Wolverines hope that 

Donnal can grow into a role 
as a better defensive option to 
Wagner. The 6-foot-9 forward 
was Michigan’s most efficient 
rebounder at the post, grabbing 
four rebounds per game. But 
Donnal struggled to make a 
consistent 
impact, 
especially 

when he came off the bench. 
Having Wagner ahead of him 
could potentially raise Donnal’s 
game as he battles for minutes, 
but it could also harm his 
confidence as the season wears 
on.

It won’t help Donnal that the 

competition for third in the post 
rotation has been intense as well. 
Beilein is planning on asking 
either freshman center Jon Teske 
or freshman forward Austin 
Davis to redshirt, while the 
other will feature in his plans. 
Based on minutes from Friday’s 
exhibition, Teske seems to have 
the edge on Davis. The 7-footer 
has height that will immediately 
help Michigan make up any size 
deficit they may have at center, 
while helping with shot blocking 
as well.

Big Ten Breakdown: Crowded 
race for the conference title

Caught in a precarious position 

of transition, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team is attempting 
to take advantage of its roster 
turnover both on the court and on 
the sideline by finding the perfect 
blend between old and new. 

After flipping their conference 

record from 8-10 in 2014 to 10-8 
in 2015 (returning to the NCAA 
Tournament in the process), the 
Wolverines look to be trending 
upward. Though the team lost 
four players — Spike Albrecht, 
Kameron 
Chatman, 
Aubrey 

Dawkins and Ricky Doyle — to 
transfers and one — Caris LeVert 
— to the NBA, none of them 
necessarily played major roles for 
Michigan last season.

With five teams ranked in 

the Associated Press preseason 
standings, the Big Ten seems 
poised to return to its familiar 
position as one of the strongest 
conferences 
in 
the 
country. 

While the Wolverines will likely 
face an uphill climb on their road 
back to the top, they have four 
talented freshmen additions and 
two respected new coaches to 
help them find their way back 
to competing for the conference 
crown. 

The Daily breaks down the 

teams that will provide the 
stiffest competition for Michigan 
in the Big Ten this season.

No. 9 Wisconsin

The 
Badgers 
may 
have 

finished in a four-way tie for 
third place in the Big Ten last 
season, but they seem to be the 
favorite to win the conference 
outright this year. Wisconsin 
returns 
all 
five 
starters, 

including Big Ten Preseason 
Player of the Year and first team 
All-American Nigel Hayes.

After 
opting 
out 
of 
the 

NBA Draft in favor of one last 
go-around in college, Hayes will 
lead the Badgers with help from 
senior guard Bronson Koenig 
and sophomore forward Ethan 

Happ, who were both selected to 
the Preseason All-Big Ten team. 
All three averaged over 12 points 
per game last season, while 
consensus Big Ten Freshman of 
the Year Happ also earned Big 
Ten All-Defensive Team honors. 
Along with two experienced 
seniors, forward Vitto Brown and 
guard Zak Showalter, the quintet 
started 
every 
game 
together 

except for one.

Chemistry 
might 
be 
the 

strongest suit in the cards for 
Wisconsin this year, and with 
the level of comfort these star 
players have with one another, 
the Badgers look to be the best 
team in the Big Ten.

No. 11 Indiana

The 
defending 
conference 

champions with a 15-3 record 
last year, the Hoosiers have the 
potential to continue their reign 
atop the Big Ten this season. 
Despite losing their strongest 
offensive threat in Yogi Ferrell 
and sturdiest role player in 
former Wolverine Max Bielfeldt, 
Indiana 
has 
enough 
quality 

returners to give Wisconsin a run 
for its money.

After 
a 
highly 
successful 

freshman season in which he 
averaged 11.9 points and 5.8 
rebounds as the unquestioned 
starter, 
sophomore 
center 

Thomas Bryant decided to return 
to Indiana and was subsequently 
named to the preseason first team 
All-America team as well as the 
All-Big Ten team. He will anchor 
the Hoosier frontcourt, while 
the backcourt will be manned 
by fellow Preseason All-Big Ten 
selection junior guard James 
Blackmon Jr., who has been 
cleared to play after suffering a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament 
halfway through the season.

Though Indiana missed out on 

the conference and tournament 
championship 
double 
after 

being upset by Michigan in the 
tournament 
quarterfinals, 
the 

Hoosiers played like the best team 
in the Big Ten for the majority 
of the year and could very well 

repeat the feat this season.

No. 12 Michigan State

Finishing as the runner-up 

in the conference with a 13-5 
record despite having two more 
wins and two fewer losses than 
Indiana, the Spartans proved that 
they could make a strong case for 
the top spot by capturing the 2016 
Big Ten Tournament title. Having 
to replace AP National Player of 
the Year Denzel Valentine will 
be a tall order, but if there is any 
team that can shoulder the blow, 
it’s Michigan State.

Boasting a freshman class 

made up of five-star recruits 
Miles Bridges and Josh Langford 
and four-star recruits Cassius 
Winston and Nick Ward, the 
Spartans seem eager to wrest 
the conference crown from the 
Hoosiers. Bridges and Langford 
were ranked in the top five 
nationally at their respective 
positions, while Winston and 
Ward were ranked in the top ten.

With head coach Tom Izzo — 

who was recently inducted into 
the Naismith Basketball Hall of 
Fame — guiding these budding 
stars, Michigan State looks to be 
as dangerous as ever in the Big 
Ten this season.

No. 15 Purdue

Another part of the four-way 

tie for third place in the Big Ten 
last season, the Boilermakers 
have 
jumped 
back 
into 
the 

conference 
title 
conversation 

with back-to-back 12-6 records 
after finishing in last place in 
the 2013-14 season. In his 12th 
season at his alma mater, coach 
Matt Painter looks to guide the 
program to even greater heights 
after reaching its eighth NCAA 
Tournament last year.

Though 
the 
Boilermakers 

lost star player A.J. Hammons 
to the NBA, they held onto 
another in sophomore forward 
Caleb 
Swanigan. 
Selected 
to 

the 
Preseason 
All-Big 
Ten 

Team, Swanigan led the team

while averaging 10.2 points in 
his first season at the collegiate 
level. Purdue will also benefit 
from the veteran experience of 
former Wolverine Spike Albrecht, 
who returns to his home state 
as a graduate transfer and the 
lone Boilermaker to have won an 
NCAA Tournament game.

While 
Purdue 
may 
be 

overlooked because of the caliber 
of the other three teams at the top, 
the Boilermakers have the pieces 
in place to make their presence 
felt in the title race.

No. 25 Maryland

The final team in that four-way 

tie for third place on the preseason 
AP Top 25, the Terrapins fell 
short of expectations after being 
tabbed as the favorite to win the 
conference crown before last 
season. But they bounced back 
with a NCAA Tournament run that 
lasted until the Elite Eight — on 
par with Wisconsin and Indiana 
for the best showing of any Big 
Ten team — before succumbing 
to the top-seeded team in their 
region, Kansas.

Junior guard Melo Trimble 

returns to carry the load for 
Maryland, despite playing well 
enough his freshman year to 
warrant the Big Ten Preseason 
Player of the Year nod at last 
season’s outset. While that title 
belongs to Wisconsin’s Hayes 
now, 
Trimble 
should 
remain 

one of the best players in the 
conference. Last year, he led the 
team in scoring average with 14.8 
points per game, 3-pointers with 
58, assists with an average of 4.9 
and steals with 44.

The Terrapins will look to 

ride their momentum from the 

end of last season in order to 
position themselves back into the 
conversation for the conference 
title this year. 

Ohio State

Landing in the middle of the 

pack in the conference last year, 
just above Michigan at 11-7, the 
Buckeyes have the ability to crash 
the party at the top this season. 
With all five starters returning 
to the team, Ohio State brings a 
developing core made up of three 
juniors, a senior and a sophomore 
to the table.

Sophomore 
guard 
JaQuan 

Lyle, a rising star, announced 
his arrival to the collegiate level 
last season with an average of 
11.2 points, 4.2 assists and 4.7 
rebounds per game. Meanwhile, 
senior forward Marc Loving, an 
established presence, capitalized 
on 
his 
leadership 
role 
with 

14 points, 1.5 assists and 5.3 
rebounds per game. Together, 
the pair will likely spearhead that 
effort for the Buckeyes this year.

Growing into their roles both 

individually and collectively, the 
starting five seems poised for a 
breakthrough, which could lead 
Ohio State to make a splash in the 
Big Ten this season.
