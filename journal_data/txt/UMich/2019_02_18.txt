Winterfest, a tournament-style 
annual philanthropic event where 
different members of fraternities and 
sororities play broomball for charity, 
will be hosted on Feb 23 by the Pi 
Kappa Alpha fraternity (PIKE). Last 
year, Winterfest was hosted on the 
property of PIKE and sponsored 
by Alpha Sigma Phi, but after Alpha 
Sigma Phi was banned from campus, 
PIKE picked up the event.
Fraternities who are members 
of 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
and sororities in the Panhellenic 
Association 
can 
participate 
by 
donating money to play in the 

tournament. The money raised will 
be donated to the Autism Alliance of 
Michigan. As of Sunday evening, the 
general Winterfest campaign has 
raised over 29,000 dollars of their 
60,000 dollar goal.
While Alpha Sigma Phi has 
hosted the event in the past, the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
recently 
banned Alpha Sigma Phi from 
campus for five years after it was 
discovered 
several 
generations 
of its members had participated 
in dangerous hazing incidents, 
according to Dean of Students Laura 
Blake Jones. One alleged incident 
involved a ‘40-yard dash’ across 
new members’ backs.

On 
Saturday 
morning, 
Michigan Health Engineered 
for All Lives (M-HEAL) and 
Timmy 
Global 
Health 
at 
the University of Michigan 
hosted their annual Global 
Health Symposium. Around 
85 students and faculty were 
in attendance.
The event featured Abdul 
El-Sayed, 2018 gubernatorial 
candidate and former Health 
Director of Detroit; Yuan-
Po Tu, Center for Disease 
Control public health analyst; 
and Business junior Anurag 
Bolneni, CFO of Blueprints 
For Pangaea.
Each 
year, 
M-HEAL 
and the Michigan chapter 
of 
Timmy 
Global 
Health 

co-host the event with the 
goal of bringing awareness 
to global health issues and 
encouraging 
students 
to 
explore 
interdisciplinary 
ways 
to 
address 
these 
problems. Both groups focus 
on 
improving 
access 
and 
quality of healthcare on a 
global scale.
El-Sayed 
opened 
the 
symposium with a speech 
about privilege, institutions 
and morality in the field of 
public health. Throughout 
the speech he referenced his 
grandmother as an example 
of a woman who, despite her 
lack of access to institutions, 
inspires him with her moral 
clarity.
El-Sayed cited the gap in 
life expectancy he witnessed 
growing 
up 
between 
his 

hometown 
in 
Bloomfield 
Hills, 
Michigan 
and 
Alexandria, 
Egypt, 
where 
his 
grandmother 
lived, 
and the similar gap twenty 
minutes away in Detroit, as 
his inspiration for getting 
involved in public health.
“I was motivated by the 
responsibility 
to 
leverage 
the 
privilege 
that 
my 
grandmother 
so 
clearly 
highlighted that I have to 
address that gap,” El-Sayed 
said.
He urged the audience to 
consider their own privileges 
and stressed the importance 
of 
thinking 
outside 
of 
institutions and holding onto 
one’s ideals.
“Increments matter. Ideals 
matter more,” El-Sayed said. 
“And the question we ask 

ourselves in these moments is 
whether or not we are moving 
forward on those ideals… 
sometimes the greatest moral 
clarity comes when you act 
independent of institutions, 
like my grandmother. So work 
hard in these institutions, 
move 
these 
institutions, 
but be guided by ideals that 
are far greater than these 
institutions.”
Engineering 
senior 
Ashley Zhang, the M-HEAL 
marketing officer, told The 
Daily in an interview after the 
event she was enthusiastic 
about having El-Sayed speak 
at the event.

On 
Feb. 
5, 
Sen. 
Debbie 
Stabenow, 
D-MI, 
sponsored 
legislation to protect funding 
for the Great Lakes that she 
claims would be siphoned off 
by President Trump to build a 
physical wall along the southern 
border. The bill was a preemptive 
response to a declaration of a 
national 
emergency 
President 
Trump announced on Friday after 
failing to corral Congress into 
funding a wall.
Stabenow’s bill, the RAIDER 
Act of 2019, seeks to prevent the 
president from using funds from 
the Army Corps of Engineers and 
Military Construction accounts 
to finance a border wall without 
the 
permission 
of 
Congress. 
According 
to 
the 
National 
Emergencies Act, these agencies 
contain the funds that are most 
at risk of being redirected under a 
national emergency.say
In a press release published 
by Stabenow’s office, she claims 
that construction of a border 
wall would reduce funds for 
“vital Michigan infrastructure

Nomination process for police

CAMPUS LIFE

Panhel changes decision on participation 
after worries regarding policy violation

Changes to commission membership elicit discussion among City Councilmembers

City 
Councilmembers 
and 
community activists are divided 
over two agenda items slated to 
appear before the City Council 
Tuesday 
night 
regarding 

the formation of an independent 
police oversight commission. One 
calls for changes to the guidelines 
for commission membership while 
the other seeks to prohibit undue 
influence over the nomination 
process.
Councilmember 
Elizabeth 
Nelson, D-Ward 5, is sponsoring the 
resolution to block what she called 

“inappropriate” involvement on 
behalf of officials who are not 
among the four liaisons designed 
to aid in selecting potential 
nominees to the commission. In 
December, Nelson attempted to 
replace 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward 2, as one of two 
City Council liaisons to the police 
oversight commission.

“I feel like I’m sort of in the 
middle of it because I am bringing 
this resolution and this resolution is 
apparently like completely opposite 
to the direction that everybody else 
going and I really tried hard to be 
among those four people and I sort 
of went down in flames,” Nelson said.

On Friday, the Ford School 
of Public Policy held the most 
recent of their Policy Talks 
@ the Ford School. The event 
featured Thomas Kalil, former 
deputy director for policy at the 
White House Office of Science 
and Technology Policy under 
former President Barack Obama. 
Kalil gave a presentation on 
U.S. science and technology 
policy and answered questions 
submitted by the audience.
Kalil began by discussing 
his 
role 
in 
the 
Obama 
administration and described 
two distinct aspects of his job: 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
policy and policy for science 
and technology. When focusing 
on science and technology for 
policy, Khalil’s job was advising 
the president.
“When making a decision that 
had a scientific or technological 
component,” Khalil said. “Then 
our job was to make sure he 
was getting the best possible 
advice.”

OVERSIGHT
From Page 1

“This is an issue that concerns 
me a lot and residents have told me 
that it concerns them. 
I 
think 
there’s 
a 
lot 
of 
disappointment 
among 
our 
community about how sort of this 
process has even happened up to 
now, so this is upsetting that we’re 
going further in this direction.”
Lumm and the other liaison to 
the commission, Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 
3, along with Councilmembers 
Julie Grand, D-Ward 3, and Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, who serve 
as liaisons to the Human Rights 
Commission, 
are 
sponsoring 
an ordinance that would alter 
the membership requirements. 
The change would allow a seven-
member majority of City Council 
to waive the restriction that city 
employees must wait five years 
from the end of their employment 
before they are eligible to sit on the 
commission in individual cases.

Ramlawi said the amendment 
was intended to help temporary 
city 
employees 
like 
election 
inspectors apply for spots on the 
commission, adding the goal was 
“not to stack this new commission 
with inside city employees.”
“There are temporary city 
employees yet they trigger that 
exclusion 
clause,” 
Ramlawi 
said. “We have other people that 
perhaps are temporary seasonal 
employees who work for the parks 
department or some other parts 
of the city, which technically 
are city employees, so we felt 
it was a prudent step to take to 
allow for these folks who are in 
these temporary positions to be 
considered.”
Calls for citizen-led oversight 
of the AAPD intensified after 
the 2014 shooting death of Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser by a 
police officer. Following months 
of debate and controversy, City 
Council 
passed 
a 
resolution 
in 
October 
establishing 
the 
commission, which will provide 
independent review of complaints 
against the Ann Arbor Police 

Department.
Over the summer, a citizen-
led task force convened by the 
city’s Human Rights Commission 
developed recommendations for 
the creation of a supervisory body 
and presented its own ordinance to 
City Council. That draft was voted 
down in favor of an ordinance 
proposed by Mayor Christopher 
Taylor following concerns about 
legal conflicts with the police 
department’s collective bargaining 
agreement and the City Charter.
Dwight Wilson, a member of 
the task force and the HRC, said 
the vagueness of the resolution 
changing the nomination criteria 
worried him.
“The reason behind it is because 
they want to have people who 
worked the polls as temporary 
workers eligible to serve,” Wilson 
said. “If that’s the reason, then 
say so. That’s somebody that’s 
been working a couple days a 
year. I don’t have any trouble 
with that if that’s who you mean, 
but it has to be specific. Don’t 
open a door that makes it look 
like what you’re trying to do is 
put on people who have a 
serious conflict of interest.”
The original amendment 
to the ordinance allowed for 
both former or current city 
employees — including police 
officers — to receive waivers 
from City Council, but an 
updated version posted to 
the city’s website on Friday 
clarified that the changes did 
not apply to law enforcement 
officers.
On 
Saturday, 
Grand 
said the sponsors intended 
to clear ambiguity in the 
wording of the ordinance.
“Our attorney has already 
come down to our meeting 
yesterday,” 
Grand 
said. 

“We want to keep that five-
year 
window 
with 
police. 
We’re hoping to change that on 
Tuesday. It was not the intent 
to get police on the commission, 
we found out that five applicants 
had 
worked 
as 
election 
inspectors, and so it was to clean 
that up.”
Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 
D-Ward 1, said he opposed 
including former or current city 
staff on the commission beyond 
election inspectors.
“It’s a terrible idea, an absolute 
non-starter with me,” Hayner 
said. “I can’t support that. It’s 
an independent police oversight 
commission, that means nobody 
from 
city 
staff, 
no 
police 
officers. There can’t be city 
employees on there, otherwise it 
wouldn’t be independent. There 
was a couple people who were 
election inspectors, and I had 
heard that they wanted to waive 
that requirement for election 
inspectors, but the way this 
thing is written, it’s basically 
like reserving the right to allow 
basically anybody on there.”
Taylor said he did not see a 
problem with allowing higher 
level city staff to serve on the 
commission.
“Serving as a city employee 
should not disqualify you from 
participating 
in 
civic 
life,” 
Taylor said. “The goal of the 
commission is to serve as, in 
part, as a bridge between the 
community and folks in City 
Hall. The goal of the commission 
is to ensure that police in 
Ann Arbor meet community 
expectations and aspirations.

When I was little, I used 
to be one of those girls who 
wished that they I were white. 
My 
parents 
immigrated 
to 
the States in the 90s, having 
previously 
lived 
under 
Communist rule in China. That 
being said, I never had the type 
of mom who would help out in 
the classroom or know how to 
bake cookies, and I was never a 
“daddy’s girl.” I had to learn a 
lot of things on my own, and it 
wasn’t easy.
 Because I had strict parents 
that asked about every detail 
about my daily life, I did the 
same thing in first grade to my 
peers as an attempt to befriend 
them. I end up coming off as 
nosy and annoying. No one 
had ever taught me that privacy 
and personal space were things 
people in this country valued. 
I spent a large portion of my 
childhood 
practicing 
piano 
and getting tutored in math; 
I felt like I was missing out on 
the all-American experience. 
It would just be so much easier 
if I were white, I kept telling 
myself. I wouldn’t have to deal 
with this shit.
I had to learn on my own 
to be proud of my Chinese-
American identity. All of my 
life, I associated being Asian 
with having strict parents and 

playing piano and studying 
math (all things I actually did, 
so I really hated that I fit the 
stereotype) — but as I grew up, 
I realized there was so much 
more than just that.
My 
identity 
revolves 
around feminism, punk rock, 
bisexuality; 
my 
identity 
revolves 
around 
being 
unapologetic and audacious, 
contrary to the submissive quiet 
girl most people assumed me 
to be. When I first tentatively 
came out as bisexual at age 
14, I remember overhearing 
someone 
saying, 
“Bisexual? 
She’s Asian though…” as if 

people of color couldn’t also 
be queer. I was tired of people 
saying things like, “Oh, you’re 
into rock? I would’ve never 
expected it-- you just don’t look 
like the rebellious type.” What 
the fuck is that supposed to 
mean, anyway?
So, 
all 
throughout 
high 
school I tried to “look” like 
the rebellious type. I started 
dressing in black and wearing 
Doc Martens with fishnets 
and ripped jeans, smudging 
my eyeliner in a don’t-fuck-
with-me way and dying my 
hair green. I was trying to 
prove myself; I was trying to 

say, “No, I’m not your average 
nice Asian girl.” I gave my 
parents an especially hard 
time growing up. Often times, 
I would go to extreme lengths 
just for a taste of freedom-- 
sneaking out to meet boys, 
hiding cigarette packs in my 
underwear drawer. Granted, 
half because these were things 
I actually wanted, but the 
other half was just because I 
just wanted to prove a point; 
that I could be a badass.

You might have seen some 
girls who wrap a piece of cloth 
around their heads. The cloth 
(called hijab or tudung or 
kerudung) covers some parts 
of their bodies – hair, ears and 
sometimes neck. One might 
wonder what else they keep 
beneath the cloth (spoiler 
alert: hair ties). During the 
colder 
months, 
the 
cloth 
might be mistaken as a winter 
headgear. During the warmer 
months, you might wonder if 
it ever gets too bothersome 
to put on extra layers when it 
is scorching outside. But that 
cloth is not just some article 
of headwear that Muslim girls 
put on their heads as a ritual 
of faith. A lot of thought goes 
into this element of a girl’s 
outfit. Below are five answers 
to your questions about the 
headscarf that you are likely 
afraid to ask:

1. The headscarf is made to 
stay on the head using pins. 

Much like a marathon runner 
pinning on a race bib, the girl 
uses several pins to make 
sure her headscarf does not 
slide to the back or front of 
the head throughout the day. 
To prevent sliding, some girls 
opt for a bonnet-
like 
cloth 
underneath the 
main headscarf 
which 
creates 
friction between 
her hair and the 
cloth.

2. There are 
many 
ways 
to 
style 
the 
headscarf. Some 
girls wrap the 
cloth 
around 
their 
heads. 
Some 
tie 
the 
cloth. Some slip on the cloth 
like a snood. Special styles 
are 
reserved 
for 
special 
occasions. Each girl has her 
own 
signature 
style 
that 
frames her face the best or is 
the easiest to put on for late 
mornings.

3. There is such a thing as a 
“bad headscarf day.” Prevent 
from 
genuinely 
giving 
constructive fashion criticism 
to the girl when you notice 
her headscarf is “unusually 
distorted.” 
She 
probably 
has 
spent 
20 
minutes 
(15 
minutes 
longer 
than 
she’s 
hoped 
for) trying to 
fix the uneven 
bumps of the 
cloth.

4
.
T
h
e 
headscarf can 
be 
made 
of 
many different 
m a t e r i a l s 
– 
cotton, 
jersey, 
silk, 
chiffon. Each girl has her 
own material preference for 
its pros and cons. Cotton 
scarves use less pins to create 
volume but do not look flowy. 
Chiffon scarves are flowy 
and elegant but lay flat on 
the head. Certain occasions 
warrant a different material 

than normal days in order 
to distinguish a look from 
an everyday one. For the 
comfiest 
headwear 
during 
long haul flights, just use a 
hoodie – no pins needed.

5. 
Contrary 
to 
popular 
assumption, 
there 
is 
no 
weapon under the scarf. Girls 
braid or tie their hair into a 
ponytail or a hair bun to keep 
the hair from sticking out 
through the scarf. Some put 
on hair ‘scrunchies’ to create 
a 
more 
voluminous 
look. 
Perhaps the most ridiculous 
thing a girl can ‘hide’ under 
her scarf is half of a pair of 
socks.

6. Hopefully these answers 
give you enough insights to 
understand that donning a 
headscarf is not solely the 
question of to do or to not 
do, but also a matter of what 
material, what color, what 
style and which pins. The 
headscarf comes with its own 
wonders, quirks and oddities 
just like any other type of 
clothing.

The art of journaling: A means of self-exploration for all

Yeah, yeah, so you’ve heard 
it before. Journaling is a 
good way to relieve stress, 
compartmentalize things you 
have to do and does great 
things for your mind overall. 
How many times have you 
been told to journal to relieve 
stress or to pick it up as a 
hobby? I cannot remember 
how many times I had been 
told before I actually started. 
I picked out a cute little 
journal over the summer with 
the intention of starting to 
journal when school started 
in August. However, I didn’t 
start and wasn’t planning on 
starting anytime soon until 
someone posted a “30-day 
Journaling 
Challenge” 
on 
their Instagram story.
So starting the month of 
December, I started doing a 
journal every day, following 

along with the challenge. 
I slowly started to realize 
that those people who had 
told 
me 
that 
journaling was 
a great way to 
de-stress were 
right. Every day, 
when I would 
whip 
out 
my 
journal to start 
writing, I would 
get this wave of 
calmness wash 
over me and it 
became a habit. 
I became proud 
of 
journaling 
and 
writing 
my 
thoughts 
down. 
It 
was 
not 
something 
that 
seemed 
cheesy or that 
only people in movies would 
do. Journaling helped me 
express who I am as a person.
I explored my identity 

through 
writing 
about 
different things in my life 
and different experiences I 
had every day. 
My 
journaling 
began 
with 
the 
“30-day 
J o u r n a l i n g 
Challenge” that 
challenged me 
to write small 
blurbs 
about 
questions such 
as 
“What 
are 
three 
words 
that you love?” 
to 
“What 
are 
three 
things 
that 
you 
admire 
about 
yourself?” After 
this challenge, I 
started writing 
small bits every 
day, whether it was about a 
person I had met that day or 
what I missed about home. 
Slowly but surely, I started 

writing about my identity 
such as how it felt to be an 
out-of-state student in a sea 
of Michganders or about how 
I dealt with being a POC in 
a school that was more than 
50% Caucasian. These small 
writing sessions every day 
not only helped me relax, but 
it helped me hash out small 
bits and pieces of my identity 
that I have been building 
upon since I was a toddler. 
And 
the 
phrase 
“don’t 
knock it till you’ve tried 
it” 
really 
does 
apply 
to 
journaling. 
There 
are 
so 
many 
different 
types 
of 
journaling. There are free-
writes, where you can write 
anything that comes to your 
mind or that you want to 
write about. There are the 
journal challenges that give 
you pre-written prompts to 
write about every day. There 
is 
also 
something 
called 
bullet-journaling which, to 

me, seems like the top tier of 
journaling. Bullet-journaling 
is a very organized way of 
keeping 
track 
of 
anything 
and everything 
that you want 
to write down 
in an orderly 
manner.
 There is no 
accurate 
way 
to 
journal. 
J o u r n a l i n g 
has been seen, 
stereotypically, 
as 
a 
hobby 
that 
many 
girls 
usually 
do. 
However, 
journaling is for 
E V E R Y O N E . 
There is nothing 
e x t r e m e l y 
feminine 
or 
masculine 
about planning out your day 
or writing your thoughts 
down. Journaling is a great 

way to start your day, have a 
break in the middle or end 
your day with a destresser. 
Start 
small. 
Maybe 
start 
writing 
down 
little thoughts 
or 
doodles 
t h r o u g h o u t 
the 
day 
on 
small scraps or 
sheets of paper. 
Give it a try 
and it may lead 
to 
something 
bigger. 
You 
might discover 
that journaling 
is a great way to 
organize 
your 
busy weeks full 
of classes and 
club meetings 
or 
to 
keep 
track of your good and bad 
days in a year.

O

n Feb. 11, the Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 

celebrated the 40-year 

anniversary of the 1979 revolution. 
In 1979, groups from across Iranian 
society — from religious extremists 
to secular non-communist left-
wing activists — violently seized 
control of the Iranian government 
through a coup, exiling Iran’s 
previous leader, Shah Mohammad 
Reza Pahlavi, who had been given 
premiership in a 1953 plan by 
American and British intelligence. 
The Shah was replaced with anti-
Western 
and 
fundamentalist 

cleric 
Ruhollah 
Khomeini 
as 

the Ayotollah, who instituted 
repressive policies and took hostile 
actions that would alter the status 
of Iran domestically and around 
the globe. The results of the 
revolution forever changed history 
and have had an immense impact 
on the relationship between Iran 
and the United States. The Islamic 
regime still holds power today, and 
on its 40th anniversary — while 
Iran’s leadership celebrates — it is a 
worthy time to commemorate and 
acknowledge the past and present 
threats that Iran has posed to the 
United States and the world.

In February 1979, as Ayatollah 

Khomeini 
became 
Supreme 

Leader, the streets of Tehran 
were filled with millions of people 
burning American flags, chanting 
and holding signs with threats 
against the U.S. and its allies. Just 
a few months later, the American-
backed Shah was deposed as 
Iran’s 
premier, 
and 
college 

students in Tehran raided the 
United States Embassy and held 
52 American diplomats hostage, 
citing the U.S.’s grant of asylum 
for the Shah as justification. With 
the revolutionary coup and the 
ensuing 444-day hostage crisis, 
the United States and Iran became 
locked in a bitter conflict and 
rivalry that has spanned all four 
decades of the Islamic Republic’s 
reign.

This tension has come to a 

head over the past few years, as 
President Donald Trump decided 
to withdraw the United States from 
the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan 
of Action (JCPOA), often referred 
to as the Iran Nuclear Deal. This 
agreement — made between the 
U.S., China, Russia, the United 
Kingdom, France, Germany, the 
European Union and Iran — was 
crafted in order to assure that 
ongoing developments to Iran’s 
nuclear 
program 
would 
not 

threaten other countries. Terms 
included an imposed International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
monitoring of Iranian nuclear 
sites, and as a result, the lifting of 
“nuclear-related” United States 
sanctions on Iran. The agreement 
was adopted by the Obama 
administration, under the auspices 
of former Secretary of State John 
Kerry, in January 2016. Proponents 
argued it would allow Iran to 
begin to moderate its foreign and 
domestic policies without many of 
the crippling sanctions placed on 
it by the United States and other 
Western powers, and would stop 
the spread of nuclear weapons in 
the Middle East.

Before and after the Iran 

Deal was adopted by the United 
States, 
domestic 
and 
foreign 

critics identified the severe flaws 
in the JCPOA. As Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
pointed out in his address to the 
United States Congress in July 
2015, the deal would “... leave Iran 
with a vast nuclear infrastructure, 
providing it with a short break-
out time to the bomb...” when the 
deal would expire in 10 years. 
Vivian Bercovici, former Canadian 
Ambassador to Israel, noted that 
among its other issues, the JCPOA 
“... did not address Iran’s ongoing 
ballistic missile program.” There 
were also those such as Sen. Ted 
Cruz, R-Texas, who argued that 
Iran was not complying with the 
terms of the deal, and thus the 
U.S. would be well served to leave 
the agreement and reimpose 
sanctions.

Last week, Iran made its true 

intentions clear – if they weren’t 
already obvious – when President 
Hassan Rouhani, elected in 2013 
to supposedly bring the change 
former President Barack Obama 
had bet on, said that Iran has 
“not asked and will not ask for 
permission to develop various 
types of missiles.” It is clear 
that Iran’s hatred for the United 
States, and its underlying desire 
to continue to build their nuclear 
power, have never wavered.So 
much for moderation in Tehran.

This 
past 
May, 
President 

Trump 
acknowledged 
the 

JCPOA’s many weaknesses and 
withdrew the United States from 
the Iran Deal, drawing both praise 
and ire from the international 
political 
community. 
Trump’s 

decision marked an informed 
pivot in U.S. policy on Iran, away 
from ungrounded idealism and 
towards a more realistic and truly 
comprehensive plan. In November, 
the 
Trump 
administration 

re-imposed all sanctions lifted 
under the terms of the JCPOA, 
putting economic pressure on Iran 
and those who do business with its 
regime, and incentivizing Iran to 
give up its enrichment of uranium 
and 
development 
of 
nuclear 

missiles. These actions, though 
not entirely sufficient in ending 
the Iranian threat, are steps in 
the right direction in preventing 
Iran from using a nuclear arsenal 
to threaten the U.S. and other 
countries to whom it is hostile. 
The decision to withdraw from the 
deal is also crucial to showing Iran 
that the United States will not be 
deceived by non-credible promises 
from a long-time adversary. 

However, Iran’s development 

of its nuclear program is not the 
only threat the country poses 
towards the U.S., its allies and 
global stability. Throughout the 
Middle 
East 
and 
worldwide, 

Iran has been involved in proxy-
conflicts, often against U.S. allies 
and interests. In a combination 
of funding and arms, Iran has 
ignited the civil war in Yemen 
through its support of the Houthi 
rebels. The war and its resulting 
humanitarian crisis have caused 
the 
deaths 
of 
thousands 
of 

innocents in Yemen. Iran has 
supported the rule of Syrian 
President Bashar al-Assad, and 

has funded and armed Hezbollah 
terrorists on the Lebanese border 
with Israel. Outside the region, 
the Islamic Republic has even 
attempted to radicalize Muslims 
in South America, and is wanted 
for 
the 
assassination 
of 
an 

investigator who uncovered Iran’s 
responsibility for the 1994 attack 
on the Jewish Community Center 
of Buenos Aires. Iran’s tactics and 
choices, if left unchecked, will 
cause more innocent Yemeni and 
Syrian citizens to die, risk Israel’s 
security, create further difficulty 
in defeating the Assad regime and 
continue to create violence and 
instability in the Near East and 
worldwide.

These 
effects 
would 
be 

disastrous for the United States 
and those seeking peace in the 
Middle East. Should the tension 
between Iranian proxies and 
Israel continue to escalate, it is 
quite possible that what is now the 
Syrian Civil War could quickly turn 
into a complete regional conflict, 
which despite President Trump’s 
announcement last December of 
a withdrawal of U.S. troops from 
Syria, may necessitate a heavier 
American military presence in 
the area. Yemeni civilians would 
continue to starve and be killed. 
As it currently stands, Iranian-
backed Hezbollah fighters are 
already 
bribing 
Syrian 
rebel 

groups to stop their fight against 
Assad and join Hezbollah efforts 
against Israel. If Iran continues 
to foster this chaos, the Near East 
could light up like a tinderbox. It 
is vital that the U.S. take notice of 
this impending threat, and take 
action to prevent these harmful 
results. To start, we must work 
with our allies to bring food and 
relief to those dying in Yemen, and 
continue to enforce the sanctions 
that will cut the revenue source for 
Iran’s malicious actions around 
the world.

Despite all the history that 

has unfolded over the past few 
decades, we must recognize that 
the dangers Iran has posed to 
the United States and its allies 
have their foundations in the 1979 
Islamic Revolution. It was then 
that a country – once a staunch 
supporter of America in the Cold 
War – became frustrated with the 
West, and positioned itself as one 
of the chief U.S. foes on the world 
stage for the foreseeable future. 
Former President George W. Bush 
classified Iran as a member of an 
“Axis of Evil” in his 2002 State 
of the Union address, and though 
many of the threats to America 
have changed in the ensuing 17 
years, Iran remains the world’s 
largest state sponsor of terror in 
the Middle East and worldwide. 
While 
President 
Rouhani, 

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and 
many of Iran’s citizens celebrate 
the world-changing events of 
1979, America must mark those 
days with sadness and pursue 
a course for the future that will 
finally bring the Iranian regime’s 
production of global instability to 
an end.

Is 2019 the year of a fully functioning autonomous car?

T

he 
hype 
has 
been 

real. 
For 
the 
past 

decade or so, we have 

seen a sudden race between 
automakers 
and 
software 

development 
companies 
to 

build the first driverless car. 
What started out as simple 
driver 
assistance 
software 

has grown to fully functional 
autopilots that claim “full 
self-driving hardware.” And 
arguably so, as there is a market 
for 
such 
technology 
with 

reports showing that human 
error is involved in over 90 
percent of all car crashes. 2019 
is already set to be a big year 
in the automotive industry 
with both Uber and Lyft 
expressing intention to take 
their companies public. Not 
to mention Uber’s potential 
$120 billion valuation (that’s 
more than the worth of the big 
three automakers combined) 
that has investors frothing at 
the mouth, eagerly awaiting 
what has been touted as the 
“most hotly anticipated IPO.” 
But amid all of this, will this 
be the year we finally see the 
launch of a fully functional 
autonomous car?

Google’s Waymo is believed 

to be the industry leader by far. 
The company was reported 
by 
California’s 
Department 

of Motorvehicles to have a 
disengagement 
once 
every 

11,154 miles, more than double 
the amount of miles of the next 
closest competitor. Even still, 
there seemingly appears to 
be quite a few imperfections 
that need to be fixed in the 
company’s technology before 
it can launch commercially. 
Waymo made many strides in 
2018, hitting a total of 8 million 
miles logged, and was building 
enthusiasm for a December 
launch of Waymo One, a fully 
driverless taxi service in the 
suburbs of Phoenix. However, 
the program ended up being 
abandoned with the company 
citing “concerns about safety” 
as the prime factor in their 
decision. Nevertheless, there 
are recent reports of a full-
service 
2019 
launch, 
with 

Waymo 
consolidating 
their 

fleet and working toward a 
driverless ride-hailing service 
in “multiple US cities.”

That 
being 
said, 
other 

autonomous programs have 
arguably seen a lot more 
obstacles the past year. Uber’s 
fatal crash in March that killed 
pedestrian Elaine Herzberg 
brought the program to a 
grinding halt for much of the 
year, as the city of Phoenix 
swiftly 
revoked 
Uber’s 

permission to operate in their 
city. Tesla has been there 
twice before: once in January 
where a user crashed into a 
stopped firetruck, and again 
in March, when a driver died 
after his Tesla crashed into a 
concrete highway divider.

While Uber’s failure did 

result in a huge reduction in 
its program, these obstacles 
have 
otherwise 
posed 

surprisingly low resistance to 
the tide of autonomy that has 
overtaken the minds of the 
entire automotive industry. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in 
an interview that he expects 
not only the “carmaker will 
achieve full self-driving in 
2019” but also that “(he) 
would be very surprised if any 
of the (other) car companies 
exceeded 
Tesla 
in 
self-

driving.”

One of those “other” car 

companies is General Motors 
Corp., a company that recently 
announced massive cutbacks 
with intentions to double down 
and focus on the autonomous 
technology. GM has taken 
quite 
a 
hushed 
approach 

to 
building 
its 
inventory, 

acquiring 
the 
technology 

startup Cruise back in 2016, 
and have been testing a line 
of nearly 200 cars over the 
past year or so. And many 
are touting GM as a force as 
formidable as Waymo in the 
automotive 
industry, 
with 

market research professionals 
saying, “GM’s technology is 
as good as Waymo’s and [that] 
they have the capability to 
develop and service those 
vehicles.”

Also of interest is the 

number of software firms 

that have sprouted up as a 
reaction to this market trend. 
Of particular note is the 
autonomous driving startup 
Aurora which has managed 
to raise $530 million in its 
second 
round 
of 
funding. 

The company was started by 
the chief technical officer of 
Google’s self-driving program 
and has since recruited the 
directors of autonomy at Tesla 
and Uber. This hotbed of talent 
has been a strong selling point 
for the group, having managed 
to already ink deals with 
Volkswagen and Hyundai.

What’s more fascinating 

is the move made by Amazon 
into the autonomous car space. 
The company announced an 
investment in Aurora earlier 
this month, betting on an 
industry 
that 
could 
help 

reduce its own costs. Amazon 
has actually been working 
on a robotic delivery system 
itself that could help automate 
some of the back-end delivery 
processes that the company 
must otherwise pay for. A 
partnership with Aurora may 
just be the key to doing that.

I think we can say with 

certainty at this point that 
autonomous cars will take over 
the industry in the foreseeable 
future. 
Smaller 
localized 

examples of this are stretching 
all the way to college campuses 
where things like the KiwiBot 
exist, a food delivery robot 
that 
patrols 
University 

of 
California-Berkeley. 

Autonomous 
technology 
is 

poised to make a substantial 
impact on our daily lives. How 
foreseeable that future is, 
however, is the main point of 
contention. Some even argue 
that we are only 30 years 
away from the singularity — 
where AI can create machines 
smarter than humans. If that’s 
going to be the case though, I 
fully expect the commercial 
launch of an autonomous car 
by the end of the year.

Forty years of the Iranian threat

L

ast week, the Supreme 
Court 
blocked 
a 

Louisiana abortion law 

that mimicked a Texas law 
forcing abortion providers to 
uphold “admitting privileges,” 
which allows providers to go 
to hospitals and perform the 
procedure there (a move that 
is more burdensome than is 
helpful). This was subsequently 
struck down in Whole Woman’s 
Health v. Hellerstedt. Since 
this decision, I think we all 
need to ask ourselves: Why do 
states continue to manufacture 
laws 
that 
are 
blatantly 

unconstitutional when it comes 
to abortion?

Let’s 
look 
at 
the 
recent 

track record. Iowa, Ohio and 
Mississippi 
have 
all 
passed 

laws that make abortion illegal 
if a fetal heartbeat is detected 
(which can occur as early as six 
weeks). South Dakota, North 
Dakota, Kentucky, Louisiana 
and Mississippi are predicted 
to completely ban abortion in 
the absence of Roe should it 
eventually be overturned in a 
majority conservative Supreme 
Court. However, with Roe v. 
Wade reinforced by cases such 
as Planned Parenthood v. Casey 
and Whole Woman’s Health v. 
Hellerstedt, precedent has made 
it virtually impossible for all of 
these policies to ever be upheld.

The crux of this issue lies in 

the fact that though landmark 
cases — such as Griswold v. 
Connecticut, Roe v. Wade and 
Planned Parenthood v. Casey 
— have set clear precedent 
that protects women’s right 
to privacy and their right to 
receive 
abortions, 
Supreme 

Court 
justices 
are 
finding 

ways to interpret these laws 
as constitutional despite the 
precedent of these cases. In the 
case June Medical Services, 
LLC 
v. 
Gee, 
Justice 
Brett 

Kavanaugh wrote his dissent not 
in opposition to the precedent 
set by Whole Woman’s Health v. 
Hellerstedt, but instead argues 
that though the law is identical 
to Texas’ abortion law, it does not 

put undue burden onto women. 
In Gonzales v. Carhart, the 
partial birth abortion ban was 
upheld, as the court argued that 
the law only banned one type of 
abortion method, and therefore 
does not inflict an undue burden 
onto women seeking abortions 
due to the variety of options still 
available to them. This method 
of abortion is, however, one 
of the only types of abortion 
women can safely receive in 
their second trimester, a time 
frame that is before the point 
of viability and should not be 
regulated as heavily.

This brings us to a second 

issue. Has the court gone too 
far in specifying the way in 
which abortion law can be 
interpreted? 
The 
loopholes 

that the courts present in 
justifying cases that seem to be 
contrary to protecting women’s 
reproductive 
rights 
coexist 

with 
policy 
that 
explicitly 

prohibits it. Perhaps the intent 
of the states that continue to 
produce laws that are clearly 
unconstitutional is to force the 
court to become judicially active 
instead of continuing to produce 
rulings that are consistent with 
precedent but have an opposing 
de facto impact to the intent 
of previous rulings. With the 
new Supreme Court lineup, 
the chance that this bench 
breaks precedent on a matter 
that has gone relatively back 
and forth for over 45 years is 
probable. While Chief Justice 
John Roberts voted down the 
Louisiana law with the liberal 
wing, the court’s opinion will 
be revisited to administer a final 
ruling; his vote is not permanent. 
The intent of preceding rulings 
are lost in the technicalities of 
these cases themselves. As time 
goes on, the court must render 
a final decision to abortion that 
is not ridden with a whole list of 
regulations that states try to find 
a way around.

This 
process 
of 
slowly 

breaking down a precedent 
until an essentially new one is 
created has been seen before, 

specifically with the NAACP 
test cases that eventually led 
to the ruling of Brown v. Board 
of Education. The case with 
abortion however may be a 
little more complex. Since the 
existence of the rights of a 
fetus change as the pregnancy 
approaches the point of viability, 
there is clearly more debate to be 
held on who is afforded which 
rights. We still have a long way 
to go before the court can render 
a decision in finality.

I’m honestly a little scared. 

To 
know 
the 
fate 
of 
my 

reproductive rights lies in such 
variability and uncertainty is no 
easy thing. While states should 
not impose such arbitrary laws 
that essentially take away a 
woman’s right to her own body, 
I am hoping that these cases 
will one day render a ruling that 
will uniformly protect the rights 
of women. Considering that 
according to an anti-abortion 
website over 2 million college-
aged students get pregnant 
every year, this issue may matter 
more to your community than 
you think it does. Abortion for 
college students can be the 
difference between getting a 
degree and dropping out for 
both men and women. 

I am grateful that women 

on the Supreme Court such as 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
are actively involved in this 
decision. However, I know that 
the politics surrounding this 
issue have historically been 
dictated by men. And while they 
heavily influence this issue, 
I fear that the importance of 
the rights of women may not 
be understood fully by them. 
Perhaps more men are involved 
in this decision than women 
are. Despite this uncertainty, as 
a woman, I am encouraged by 
the words of abolitionist Sarah 
Grimke: “I ask no favor for my 
sex; all I ask of our brethren is 
that they take their feet off our 
necks.”

It’s 
hard 
to 
see 
Chaka 
Khan release an album in 
2019 without appreciating the 
panoramic sweep of her career 
— she’s best known for her 
defining role in funk and R&B 
of the ’70s and ’80s, which 
means she lived and worked 
through at least one drastic 
transition in American musical 
history. She made her defining 
career 
moves 
before 
the 
internet changed everything, 
sure, but she also lived in a 
time before drum machines 
were the norm, before hip hop 
coalesced as a genre. She has 
collaborated with Ray Charles 
and Mary J. Blige, separated by 
two decades. There’s a street 
in Chicago named after 
her.
She 
isn’t 
a 
relic, 
though, despite her last 
few albums seeming to 
signal a career coming 
to 
a 
gliding 
stop. 
2004’s ClassiKhan was 
a collection of velvet-
curtained 
standards 
that could have been a 
fitting culminating statement 
— the album feels like a 
victory lap of sorts, a record 
highlighting the voice of an 
artist who has proven that she 
can use it in a wide variety of 
contexts. 2007’s Funk This did 
something similar with ’70s 
funk — both albums worked 
more as nostalgic tributes by 
an acknowledged master than 
any new, definitive statement.
The production credits on 
the 
recently-released 
Hello 
Happiness signal that this 
has changed. The standout is 
the British house DJ Switch, 
who has production credit 
on every song. He is perhaps 
best represented in his work 
with M.I.A., for whom he 
backs with a twitchy digital 
pyrotechnics. Given his EDM 
roots, it’s a strange choice for 

him to be producing Khan’s 
record. The combination has 
the vague potential to be 
interesting, but the result is 
an album in which it feels like 
every component is at odds 
with every other component, 
a confused muddle that never 
really gets off the ground. It 
seems as though Switch tried a 
sort of updated 1970s, tossing 
in a smorgasbord of vaguely 
funky sounds — the Hammond 
organ on “Too Hot,” the reedy 
guitar on “Ladylike,” the wah 
pedal on “Isn’t That Enough.” 
Sampling is, at this point, a 
canonical practice in dance 
music, but this is sampling 
at its most facile, its most 
Potemkin. Maybe it’s because 
we have Khan’s older music 
to compare Switch to, but it 
seems like the music doesn’t 

get anywhere close to the 
open-ended, vocal riffs and 
delicate 
interplay 
of 
funk 
music or the propulsiveness 
of disco. Phrases that could 
have 
been 
convincing 
are 
crammed into four-and-two-
bar loops, a production choice 
that sticks out next to Khan’s 
musicianship 
— 
her 
voice 
hasn’t lost any of its power, 
and she readily bends pitch 
and crosses barlines as the rest 
of the backing track proceeds 
in computerized lockstep.
Overall, 
the 
production 
feels like someone who likes 
listening to himself talk too 
much, like someone fascinated 
by his own cleverness even 
as he talks over the more 
interesting 
conversational 
partner. There are moments 
where I wanted the twitchy 

percussion and the irritating 
synths to melt away and simply 
let Khan’s voice through — the 
title track, in particular, has 
the most potential to rival 
Khan’s work from the 1970s 
and 1980s, but it’s just so 
overburdened. There are also 
more than a few embarrassing 
debacles. It’s advisable for 
anyone reading this to just 
skip “Don’t Cha Know” unless 
they 
want 
an 
unpleasant 
reminder that dubstep ever 
happened, 
shortly 
followed 
by 
the 
horrifying 
thought 
that 
somewhere, 
probably 
in Britain, it might still be 
happening.
As 
I 
was 
listening 
to 
Hello Happiness, I couldn’t 
help but think of the now-
infamous interview that one 
of Khan’s past collaborators, 
Quincy Jones, gave in 
2018. Over and over, 
he 
emphasized 
that 
the 
popular 
music 
landscape of the US is 
missing real, thorough 
appreciation 
for 
the 
past; 
musicians 
are 
forgetting 
that 
all 
possibility 
for 
progression 
comes 
from taking seriously what has 
come before. “Producers now 
are ignoring all the musical 
principles 
of 
the 
previous 
generations . . . You’re supposed 
to use everything from the 
past. If you know where you 
come from, it’s easier to get 
where you’re going.” Given 
that Khan’s discography is one 
possible way to survey almost 
a 
half-century 
of 
musical 
history, it’s frustrating that 
this album feels trapped in the 
particularities of the present 
moment — a lazy, appropriative 
production style and lack of 
real substance dressed up with 
flashy instrumentals. It feels 
like Khan doesn’t deserve this, 
this late in her career — I hope 
that there is another album 
after this one, and that it is 
better.

‘Hello Happiness’ is a 
missed mark for Khan

MUSIC REVIEW

‘Hello Happiness’ 

Chaka Khan

Island Records

In December of 2017, the first 
trailer for “Alita: Battle Angel” 
hit the internet. Adapted from 
the iconic Japanese manga/
anime 
series 
“Battle 
Angel 
Alita,” a live-action 
“Alita” 
movie 
was 
the 
decades-in-the-
making 
dream 
of 
James 
Cameron’s 
(“Avatar”), 
and 
had the hype and 
mystique 
of 
a 
legitimate 
passion 
project 
from 
the 
acclaimed 
director. 
The 
film 
would 
tell the story of a 
discarded 
cyborg 
named Alita who is 
resurrected with no 
memories of her past 
and must embark on 
a journey to discover 
who — and what — she is. 
Then, the trailers dropped, 
and we were introduced to 
Alita’s giant CGI eyes that were 
met with unanimous distaste 
and generally made everyone 
uncomfortable, 
evoking 
the “uncanny valley” effect 

describing the uneasy feeling 
one gets when something is 
almost 
human-looking, 
but 
not quite. At this point, I had 
written off the film as an 
ambitious if misguided product 
of a visionary director with 
nobody around to tell him “no.”

Having now seen the film, I 
was only sort of right. Make no 
mistake, “Alita: Battle Angel” 
is flawed, and those infamous 
CGI eyes might be a good 
explanation as to why. This is 
because the film seems to fall 
victim to the same plight; it 

looks like a bonafide science 
fiction blockbuster, but with 
something that’s just not quite 
right. 
James 
Cameron 
has 
worked with director Robert 
Rodriguez (“Sin City: A Dame 
to Kill For”) to faithfully adapt 
a unique and vividly imagined 
world 
to 
the 
screen, 
but 
something 
about 
the 
presentation of 
it gives the film 
a sort of cheap, 
made-for-TV 
look. The film 
is 
absolutely 
gorgeous when 
it 
wants 
to 
be, and some 
of the action 
sequences 
are 
truly 
spectacular, 
but 
it’s 
the 
expository, 
low-action shots that often look 
like cheap sci-fi camp. “Alita” as 
a series has long marketed itself 
as the classic cyberpunk story, 
but its flash-in-the-pan visual 
theatrics feel one-note when 
compared to a film like 2017’s 
“Blade Runner: 2049,” a sci-fi 

epic with similar themes that 
was one of the most visually 
enthralling films of the modern 
era.
The 
most 
disappointing 
element of the film, however, 
is its script. The dialogue 
is 
often 
painfully 
cheesy; at one point, 
mid-skirmish, 
we 
hear Alita think to 
herself (in voiceover) 
“I do not standby in 
the presence of evil!” 
Then, 
Alita 
lands 
another 
punch 
and 
yells the exact same 
sentence, again, not 
a second after we 
heard it in voiceover. 
Beyond the dialogue, 
it’s conceptually ill-
conceived 
to 
boot. 
The 
film 
refuses 
to engage with its 
cyberpunk 
roots 
in 
any 
meaningful 
way, 
instead 
using 
the sub-genre as an 
aesthetic preference. 
This 
is 
because 
Alita’s 
cybernetic 
nature is never truly 
addressed. In media 
like “Blade Runner,” 
“Westworld” 
and 
“Ex 
Machina,” 
the 
cerebral core of the 
film lies in a struggle 
to define humanity. 
The 
Replicants 
of 
“Blade 
Runner” and the Hosts of 
“Westworld” all struggle with 
who and what they are, trying 
to make sense of their own 

existence 
as 
a 
synthesized 
intelligence. 
Cameron 
never 
asks Alita to wrestle with these 
questions, and the film feels 
neutered as a result.
So what, then, makes “Alita” 
worth seeing? For lack of a 

better word, its heart. What it 
lacks in brains, the film makes 
up for with pure, unabashed 
earnestness. 
Watching 
the 
film, I was often reminded 

of 
the 
heart-on-its-sleeve 
sincerity of anime such as 
“Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure.” For 
better or worse, “Alita” is more 
concerned with impassioned 
declarations of love in the heat 
of battle than it is with cerebral 
questions regarding 
human 
nature. 
Luckily, this works 
most of the time, 
and 
the 
film 
is 
frequently heartfelt 
as a result. Rosa 
Salazar (“Birdbox”) 
is the best part 
of the film as the 
titular Alita. She 
plays the character 
with just the right 
blend of intensity 
and 
wide-eyed 
(no pun intended) 
enthusiasm 
for 
the 
world 
she’s 
rediscovering. 
Speaking 
of 
the 
giant eyes, despite 
all the misguided 
decisions that went 
into their existence, 
they 
do 
actually 
lend the character 
an extra layer of 
expressiveness that 
genuinely 
works. 
It’s in this way that 
those CGI peepers 
serve as a solid 
analogy for the film 
as a whole; rough around the 
edges and uncomfortable at 
times, but once you get used to 
it there’s something undeniably 
infectious about its soul.

6A — Monday, February 19, 2019
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I recently got hooked on 
“You,” 
Netflix’s 
late-2018 
thriller drama about a bookstore 
manager named Joe Goldberg 
(Penn Badgley, “Gossip Girl”) 
and his girlfriend, Guinevere 
Beck (Elizabeth Lail, “Once 
Upon a Time”). Joe seems like 
the perfect boyfriend, but is 
actually an obsessive stalker 
who murders those close to 
Beck in an effort to “protect” 
her from the chaos of her own 
life. Joe’s micromanaging and 
fake feminism are carefully 
realized 
by 
Badgley 
and 
the 
show’s 
creators, 
and 
delightfully 
infuriating 
to 
watch — but strangely, the 
character who often annoyed 
me the most in the moment was 
Beck herself.
Beck is a student in NYU’s 
MFA program, the avid reader 
and aspiring writer to Joe’s 
bookstore 
manager. 
Their 
shared versedness in literature 
is the pedestal from which 
they constantly judge other 
people, whether explicitly or 
inadvertently, starting from the 
very first scene when they meet. 
Beck approaches Joe, and he 
wonders via voice-over whether 
the book she’s looking for will 
essentially deem her worthy 
of further attention; when she 
asks after the Paula Fox novel 
“Desperate 
Characters,” 
he 
is impressed, and the viewer 
registers an early victory for 
Beck in the eyes of Joe. Maybe 
this is the problem: Beck’s 
character is introduced largely 
through Joe’s eyes. No wonder 
a misogynist would see her 
as ideal: She reads “obscure” 
old literature, secretly hates 
her vapid friends and can’t 
concentrate on her own writing 
worth anything unless Joe is 
around.
The 
thing 
that 
annoyed 
me 
about 
Beck’s 
portrayal 
in “You” is her approach to 
the world of writing. I am an 
aspiring writer myself, and 
I know a lot of other people 
in those same shoes, many of 
whom have wildly different 
approaches to creating and 
consuming literature. I have 
never met anyone in real life 
whose approach is like Beck’s. 
That’s not a compliment. Beck 
skates by in her MFA program 
in a way that artists of any type 
are often conditioned early 
against doing; she’s the type of 
writer who sits around waiting 
for inspiration to strike. Any 
writer who is good enough to 
get into NYU’s MFA program 
ought to also be serious enough 
to be able to crank out a story 
for a workshop, inspiration 
or no, and yet when Beck is 
told to write one, she acts as 
if she’s never done this before 
and simply decides not to do it. 
The professor accepts this and 
says they can reschedule Beck’s 
workshop for a different day.
Moreover, historical writers 
and works are romanticized, 
while 
modern 
writers 
are 
brushed 
off. 
For 
instance, 
Beck’s 
classmate 
Blythe 

(Hari 
Nef, 
“Assassination 
Nation”), perhaps one of the 
best characters in the show, 
is praised constantly, but her 
impressiveness 
seems 
tied 
more to the strange concepts 
behind her stories and her 
superficially 
interesting, 
“worldly” 
background 
(in 
contrast to Beck’s own New 
England childhood), than to 
the depth of her thought. This 
ties into a problem that “You” 

has with the image of “writers” 
and “readers,” exemplified in 
a different moment when Joe 
texts Beck to asks what she’s 
currently reading. She sends 
back a picture of a book resting 
on her bare legs, post-shower.
“You”’s approach seems to 
me like, and hopefully is, a 
commentary upon this way of 
looking at reading and writing, 
holding Joe and Beck alike 
under criticism. Yet it is still off-
putting, because the portrayal 
of the literary world in “You” 
is so instantly recognizable as 
the dreamy world of reading 
and writing that many people 
often incorrectly picture. The 
classicist view of literature 
is so often confined to the 
sorts of masterpieces Joe and 
Beck so often reference, like 

“Wuthering Heights.” When 
many people picture curling 
up with a book for fun, they 
picture the same leatherbound, 
beautiful, carefully maintained 
hardbacks 
that 
Joe 
keeps 
stored up in the glass prison 
below his bookstore. These 
— Joe preaches repeatedly to 
Beck and to the audience — 
are classics; they are works by 
the masters, some of the best 
pieces of art humanity has ever 
produced. There’s a reason 
the image of the Mooney’s 
bookstore resonates with us: 
We’ve seen it before, time and 
time again.
But the show skims past 
some of the problems with this 
romantic view of literature. 
The “classics” don’t include 
everybody; in fact, they have 
traditionally been extremely 
exclusive. I would argue that 
some of the most exciting, 
dynamic and interesting things 
that have ever happened in 
the world of literature are 
happening right now. We’re 
so lucky to live in an era when 
so many literary boundaries 
are being pushed in terms of 
subject matter, genre and style. 
We’re lucky to live in a time 
when the exclusive past of the 
literary canon is finally being 
recognized with, and the voices 
of queer writers, writers of color, 
female 
writers, 
indigenous 
writers and more writers from 
traditionally 
marginalized 
communities are starting to be 
amplified. “You”’s treatment 
of the literary community — 
via, again, the purposefully 
distasteful characters of Joe 
and Beck — makes no mention 
of this, choosing instead to 
elevate the names of long-dead 
writers 
whose 
voices 
have 
been glorified plenty enough 
anyway.
The fetishization of reading 
is dangerous because, at the 
risk of sounding extreme, it 
makes reading mean nothing; 
it strips the things that make 
reading what it is — its precision 
and sensitivity, its union of 
the past and the future and its 
feeling of a continued tradition, 
its overwhelming capacity for 
empathy-building— 
of 
their 
weight, swapping them out in 
favor of nostalgic and flowery 
images. The hot guy in a New 
York 
City 
bookstore 
who’s 
impressed that you’ve heard of 
Hemingway. The hot girl in a 
huge city apartment who calls 
herself a writer, but can’t seem 
to work past her own lack of 
ideas.
I realize a single person 
like me hardly has the right 
to 
personally 
measure 
the 
perimeter of the literary world 
and proclaim my own vision 
of it the correct one. I only 
wish that in a world where, 
on the whole, reading is only 
superficially fashionable (if I 
had more time here, I might 
delve into the whole Rupi Kaur 
conversation), representations 
of the literary world were 
less often romanticized and 
idealized, 
and 
more 
often 
reflective of the real vibrancy 
that 
characterizes 
that 
community from the inside out.

DAILY LITERATURE COLUMN

The dangers of idolatry 
in books and Netflix’s 
new original series ‘You’

There’s an episode of “Mad 
Men” where Don Draper and 
his colleagues are tasked with 
writing a TV commercial for 
a brand of a diet soda. The 
clients make it easy — they’re 
looking for a frame-for-frame 
remake 
of 
Ann-Margret’s 
opening performance in “Bye 
Bye Birdie.” But when the 
agency delivers on that request, 
complete with a coquettish 
Ann-Margret 
look-alike, 
the 
soda reps recoil and reject the 
ad.
“I don’t think there’s any 
ambiguity about this being 
exactly — and I mean exactly — 
what you asked for,” Don says 
in disbelief. Yes, it is what they 
asked for, the clients concede, 
but something about it isn’t 
right. It’s Don’s boss Roger who 
finally identifies the problem: 
“It’s not Ann-Margret.”
I wanted so badly to like 
“Miracle Workers,” TBS’s new 
limited-series comedy about the 
inner workings of Heaven. It 
promised to be a high-concept 
“The Office” meets “The Good 
Place.” It stars Steve Buscemi 
(“Boardwalk Empire”) as a 
slovenly, addled God, an off-
kilter Daniel Radcliffe (“Harry 
Potter”) and the wonderful 
“Blockers” breakout Geraldine 
Viswanathan. This is exactly 
— and I mean exactly — what I 
asked for.
Still, it’s not Ann-Margret. 

Despite everything it has going 
for it, “Miracle Workers” is 
not nearly as good as it should 
be. And it isn’t immediately 
clear why that’s true. It’s some 
combination 
of 
half-baked 
humor, 
murky 
exposition, 
contrived 
stakes 
and 
the 
fact that the eschatological 
absurdism genre has been done 
before to much better success. 
“The Good Place” comparisons 
are probably unfair, but they 
can’t be helped.
Eliza (Viswanathan), a young, 
dutiful employee of Heaven, 

Inc., is granted a reassignment 
from the Department of Dirt to 
the understaffed Department of 
Answered Prayers, where the 
manic, lonely Craig (Radcliffe) 
deals 
with 
the 
billions 
of 
prayers 
sent 
upstairs 
from 
Earth. Given the metaphysical 
limitations of Heaven’s prayer-
granting abilities (employees 
can 
only 
alter 
the 
world 
through 
“discrete 
natural 
phenomena”), 
the 
three 
or 

four prayers Craig chooses to 
answer each day are low-stakes 
— like finding lost gloves and 
car keys. The rest of the prayers 
are stamped “Impossible” and 
vaulted up to God (Buscemi), 
who has absolutely no interest 
in handling any of them.
Buscemi’s God is juvenile, 
moody and makes everyone 
around 
him 
miserable. 
He 
longs for the days when people 
on Earth sacrificed rams in 
his honor and laments that 
the world is now too complex, 
too broken for him to handle. 
It’s a bit of a shift from “The 
Good 
Place,” 
where 
the 
immortal universe operates like 
clockwork, with bright pastels 
and 
breezy 
sound 
effects. 
Sufficiently disgruntled, God 
decides to absolve himself of 
his responsibilities by blowing 
up Earth, a plan he’ll execute in 
two weeks … until Eliza steps in.
Eliza is the real heart of 
“Miracle Workers,” and it seems 
like she’s the best chance the 
show has to stay compelling 
and worth investing in moving 
forward. 
Viswanathan 
is 
surrounded by exceptionally 
talented actors — Buscemi’s bit 
can get old fast but he’s still a 
joy to watch, Radcliffe boasts 
an impressive range and the 
kooky side characters who color 
in the rest of the world are all 
plenty endearing. It’s in rough 
shape now, but it won’t take 
any miracles to save this show 
— only some faith that this cast 
can turn it into something more 
worthwhile.

Dr. Macfarlane is missing a 
finger. At the beginning of Yangsze 
Choo’s second novel, “The Night 
Tiger,” that’s essentially all readers 
know. We’re not sure how the 
doctor lost it or where it is now, let 
alone why he so desperately wants 
his houseboy, Ren, to get it back for 
him. With hardly any explanation, 
Dr. Macfarlane begs Ren from 
his deathbed to find the finger 
and return it to his grave within 
49 days of his death. Ren agrees 
to do his bidding, and soon finds 
there is much more to the mystery 
surrounding Dr. Macfarlane and 
his missing finger than there had 
first appeared.
The story, which is set in 
Malya (an older name for what 
is now modern-day Malaysia), 
alternates between Ren’s point of 
view and that of the novel’s other 
protagonist, Ji Lin. Ji Lin is a 
strong-minded and independent 
girl who has sacrificed her dream 
of continuing her education and 
becoming a nurse in order to help 
keep her family afloat. She has a 
day job as a seamstress and works 
at a dancing hall on the side to 
earn enough money to pay off 
her mother’s Mahjong gambling 
debts. Ji Lin is a refreshingly 
determined 
and 
strong-willed 
female protagonist who frequently 
outsmarts the men around her. Her 
clever and humorous demeanor 
makes it easy for readers to root 
for her and makes the novel more 
entertaining as a whole.

There’s also Ji Lin’s stepbrother, 
Shin, who she grew up with but 
hasn’t seen in months. Shin, who 
has a somewhat guarded and stoic 
personality from living in fear of 
becoming like his abusive father, 
is training in Singapore to become 
a doctor. All of Ji Lin’s friends find 
him utterly irresistible, but Ji Lin 
has definitely, most certainly never 
been interested in him (until now, 
maybe).
Despite Ji Lin’s worries of 
her stepfather discovering her 
mother’s debts and her job in the 

dance hall, everything appears to 
be normal. But then, the deaths 
begin. A salesman is discovered 
dead on the side of the road. Dogs 
disappear without any explanation, 
never to be seen again. A woman is 
found half-eaten on a plantation, 
by what locals suspect was a 
weretiger, a mythical creature that 
shapeshifts between human and 
tiger. And when Ji Lin pickpockets 
a vial with a single finger in it from 
a customer at the dance hall, it’s 
clear that she and Ren are destined 

to come together to unravel the 
mystery surrounding the deaths 
and weretigers side-by-side.
Choo (whose debut novel “The 
Ghost Bride” is being adapted into 
a TV show by Netflix) was born in 
Malaysia and has imparted much 
of her Malaysian and Chinese 
culture into the story, a visual 
highlight of the novel. From the 
food the characters eat to the 
clothes they wear and the places 
they live, readers are exposed to 
a part of the world and way of life 
they may not be familiar with. 
The idea of weretigers, which is at 
the heart of the novel, also stems 
from traditional tales and beliefs 
that originated in Malaysia and 
other parts of Asia, as Choo details 
in a “notes” section in the back of 
the novel. The motif of chinese 
homonyms (words that sound or 
are spelled alike but have different 
meanings) is also heavily present 
in “The Night Tiger,” as well as 
themes of colonialism and tensions 
between foreigners and locals in 
villages.
The resulting novel is a blend 
of culture, history and mythical 
tales. Choo has crafted an exciting 
and enjoyable story that bridges 
the genres of mystery and fantasy 
and has just the right amount of 
thriller to keep readers on the edge 
of their seats. Choo’s characters 
are well-developed and intriguing, 
and she unites them through a 
complex plot she has expertly 
weaved together. Even without 
such strong characterization and 
plot, the cultural road trip the novel 
provides is reason enough to read 
“The Night Tiger.”

The fetishization 
of reading is 
dangerous 
because, at the 
risk of sounding 
extreme, it makes 
reading mean 
nothing; it strips 
the things that 
make reading 
what it is — its 
precision and 
sensitivity, its 
union of the past 
and the future 
and its feeling of a 
continue tradition.

2B — February 18, 2019

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Each Friday, Declan Mitchell 
goes to Riley’s Children’s Hospi-
tal in Indianapolis.
If you went there looking for 
him, he would be the one dressed 
head-to-toe in sports attire, as he 
always is: jersey, socks, the whole 
works. Sometimes it’s Michigan 
gear. Sometimes it’s a LeBron 
James day. Sometimes it’s the 
Indiana Pacers.
Declan’s mother, Sarah, says he 
likes to show off his uniform to 
the nurses.
And then Declan, just 11 years 
old, sits in a chair for four hours 
and gets a blood infusion. Once a 
week. Every week.
Declan has Hunter Syndrome. 
It’s a rare, genetic disease that 
only affects males, and it means 
that he is missing a particular 
enzyme that is crucial to cellular 
repair. Fewer than 500 boys in the 
country are affected by the condi-
tion.
Hunter Syndrome is degen-
erative, and there is no cure. 
Declan can still walk and run and 
climb stairs, but eventually, that 
will change. He is cognitively 
impaired — Sarah estimates he 
has the intellectual ability of a 
three-year-old — so his speaking 
ability is limited, though he is able 
to communicate what he wants or 
needs. That, too, will cease even-
tually.
The life expectancy for Hunter 
Syndrome used to be just 15 years. 
Thanks to these blood infusions, 
which replace the enzyme Declan 
is missing, that number could be 
doubled.
“Honestly, he really loves going 
(to the hospital) so much, because 
it’s a part of his life,” Sarah told 
me over the phone two weeks 
ago. “He doesn’t think anything 
different, and on Fridays, we go 
there.”
So every Friday, Declan sits. He 
eats snacks and watches movies 
to pass the time. He loves Michi-
gan football, since his grandma 
graduated from the University 
and his mom attended for a year, 

so his favorite thing to watch is a 
Michigan football DVD.
“We actually have to keep 
replacing (it). Thank God it’s on 
Amazon,” Sarah joked. “It’s like 
one of his favorite movies, and it’s 
so worn out because we watch it 
all the time.”
But that’s Declan. A neighbor 
described him as a creature of 
habit. He watches sports habitu-
ally. He plays basketball habitu-
ally. He wears jerseys habitually.
These things make him tick. 
More importantly, they allow him 
to live as normally as he can. 
Declan was born a healthy 
baby.
It wasn’t until he turned three 
that Declan was diagnosed with 
Hunter Syndrome, and even then 
it wasn’t a simple thing to diag-
nose.
Declan’s pediatrician didn’t 
suspect 
anything. 
His 
occu-
pational therapist thought his 
breathing was off, but Sarah says 
she wrote it off as allergies and 
asthma. He had some ear infec-
tions and respiratory issues, but 
again, on its own, those traits 
didn’t immediately jump out as a 
sign that something was wrong, 
especially for something as rare 
as Hunter Syndrome to be sus-
pected.
It took an occupational thera-
pist and a speech therapist who 
recognized some warning signs 
to push Sarah and her husband, 
Tim, to bring Declan to a special-
ist. It was that genetic doctor who 
finally connected the dots.
“When we got the diagno-
sis, we thought, this cannot be,” 
Sarah said. “There is no way this 
could be this severe. Because he 
was talking, and he was happy. 
Granted, he was a little bit sore 
and some things, but we didn’t 
know.”
Sarah and Tim started googling 
Hunter Syndrome, and they saw 
pictures of other boys with the 
condition.
“We were like, ‘Oh my God, 
they all look like him,’ ” Sarah 
said.
From there, the Mitchells went 
the only way they could: onward. 

Sarah stumbled onto some blogs 
made by mothers of other boys 
with Hunter Syndrome, and she 
reached out to them, joining a 
supportive community of people 
going through the same thing.
Sarah says new families often 
have a lot of questions early on, 
and it’s clear she knows from 
experience.
The Mitchells enrolled Declan 
in their local public school in 
Westfield, Ind., where he has 
learned in a modified classroom 
since he was in preschool. He has 
an aide, Andrew, who spends each 
day with Declan and helps facili-
tate his day.
The goal, in the end, is to make 
Declan’s life as normal as possible, 
both in school and out. For some-
one like him, that means keeping 
most things in his life consistent 
and familiar while integrating 
any new things — like curricu-
lum or new relationships — slowly 
around him.
So when Declan moved to mid-
dle school, where he takes classes 
now, he spent the prior summer 
getting familiar with his new 
teacher, Maureen Craver.
“We just did a lot of really fun 
stuff just to get him excited to be 
in the new classroom with me and 
in a new school,” Craver said. “He 
loves basketball, so we played a 
lot of basketball and a lot of fun 
games. So I got to kind of know 
him that way and know what he 
liked and what he didn’t like.”
Craver had never heard of 
Hunter Syndrome before meeting 
Declan. Beyond the summer spent 
with Declan, she met with Tim, 
Sarah and Declan’s last teacher, to 
get familiar with the intricacies of 
Declan and Hunter Syndrome.
But optimizing Declan’s expe-
rience is a group effort. The 
principal, assistant principals, 
secretaries, teachers and even the 
other students play a part in mak-
ing Declan feel as comfortable as 
possible.
And, believe it or not, sports 
come in here too.
“I think he uses it as a way to 
connect with other people,” Crav-
er said. “So he wears some sort of 

— usually an NBA team — shirt or 
jersey every day. You know, he’ll, 
if he’s maybe a little shy around 
someone or if we have new peer 
students come in, he’ll kind of 
look down at his shirt all coy and 
use it as a talking point.
“… All the administration and 
teachers and staff here know that 
about Declan, and so if our gym 
teacher sees him in the hallway, 
she’ll say, ‘Oh, Declan, I love your 
Heat shirt today!’ to start a con-
versation. Or sometimes it’s other 
boys in the hallway with different 
sports shirts on, and he’ll go up to 
them and say, ‘Oh, Pacers shirt.’ 
So he uses it as definitely a way to 
connect with people.” 
At home, things have changed 
since Declan was diagnosed.
Sarah used to work on the 
wealth management team at 
Merrill Lynch. Declan began to 
have some struggles in daycare, 
though. He was sick a lot, and 
because of a lack of awareness 
that accompanies Hunter Syn-
drome, he would push kids over 
and become irritated.
So Sarah and Tim decided 
Sarah should become a stay-at-
home mom.
“It wasn’t a decision I would 
have normally made, but it was an 
automatic decision, like, I would 
just stay home with him,” Sarah 
said. “So for a few years, we just 
lived on Tim’s salary, and that was 
very unplanned, so things were a 
little tight.
“But that was just what had to 
be done.”
Sarah has since picked up a 
part-time retail job, while Tim 
works as a vertical sales manager 
for a global electrics company.
In a way, though, taking care 
of Declan is a full-time job, and 
Sarah would be the first person to 
tell you that she can’t do it alone. 
Her parents have moved closer to 
home to help out, and the commu-
nity around her helps too.
None of this is to say that any-
body is complaining, because 
whatever Declan requires in 
attention he gives back in happi-
ness.
Declan likes to take walks to 

neighbors’ houses to play basket-
ball. Oakley says everyone is just 
happy Declan can play.
He has made friends with the 
other children in the neighbor-
hood, including Oakley’s son, 
Dylan, who passes down basket-
ball jerseys for Declan to wear.
“I know that, like, he’s kind of 
a handful,” Sarah said. “He’s just 
kind of a busy kid with a short 
attention span, and like a low 
vocabulary. So he can be kind of 
a handful, but I know the people 
who know us, like, he’s so happy. 
And he brings a lot of people so 
much joy.
The worst part of Hunter Syn-
drome is the degenerative part.
Declan has some problems 
climbing stairs. At some point, the 
Mitchells will need to move into a 
one-level home.
Special education students are 
allowed to attend school until 
they are 22. For most students, 
Craver says the goal is to move 
students into a “supported home 
environment,” and even get them 
a job. For Declan, though, that 
may not be possible, depending on 
how healthy he can stay.
“I know people who have 
already 
been 
through 
that 
because I have friends in the com-
munity,” Sarah said. “So I kind 
of know what that journey looks 
like, because of other kids that are 
the same age that are more severe, 
a little further ahead and a couple 
years older. But it’s just, kind of, 
nothing prepares you for it, even if 
you know what’s coming. It’s just 

kind of crappy.”
What is here now, though, is 
something that Declan, Sarah, 
Tim and everyone who knows 
them is thankful for.
He can still talk — things like 
‘mom’ and ‘dad’ and ‘I want that 
movie.’ That is not a small thing.
“It sounds weird, but we’re 
very grateful for that,” Sarah said.
And more importantly, Declan 
still makes an impact on those 
around him. When the Mitchells 
take a trip to the grocery store, 
Sarah says they always run into 
people who know Declan.
Declan can still watch Michi-
gan football and the NBA. He is 
still active, still shooting hoops at 
neighboring houses.
Something about Hunter Syn-
drome is that Declan isn’t capable 
of understanding that he is any 
different than other kids. The 
people around him see to it that 
his life is improved as much as 
possible.
The kicker is that, along the 
way, Declan has done the same in 
return.
Money is being raised to fund 
research for gene therapy, which is 
thought to be a potential cure for 
Hunter Syndrome, at projectalive.
org. There is also a gofundme page at 
www.gofundme.com/projectalive. As 
of the writing of this article, the page 
has raised $2,268,810 with a goal of

SportsMonday Column: Declan Mitchell and the joy he brings

Michigan sweeps Binghamton

Going into the eighth inning 
on Saturday, the No. 17 Michigan 
baseball team (3-0 overall) was 
tied 4-4 with Binghamton (0-3). 
It was the second game in a three-
game series, with the Wolverines 
notching a 10-0 victory in the first 
game of the series.
Saturday, 
though, 
was 
a 
different story. Michigan went 
down 4-2 in the third inning 
after senior third baseman Blake 
Nelson’s three errors propelled 
Binghamton to score three runs.
“We had a tough defensive 
day on Saturday, but that’s a 
fluke,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “It’s just a hiccup. I don’t 
anticipate very many games like 
that, but those days happen and 
we just have to move on.”
Clawing its way back to even 
the score against the Bearcats 
with a run in both the fourth 
and 
fifth 
innings, 
Michigan 
was looking to find momentum. 
Finding it in the bottom of the 
eighth, Nelson singled to left field 
and advanced to third on two 
wild pitches, allowing sophomore 
shortstop Jack Blomgren’s single 
to knock him in for the go-ahead 
run.
With the nail-biter on Saturday 
done, the Wolverines came to play 
on Sunday. Holding the Bearcats 
to two runs, they broke out with 
a six-run eighth inning to win the 
game 12-2.
“I and my coaching staff like 
the way we put the exclamation 
mark on the weekend with the 
six-run eighth inning to really 
extend the lead,” Bakich said. 
“The game was much more in 
question than 12-2, but it took a 
six-run burst there in the eighth 
to really separate.”
All three of the weekend games 
were won on the back of the 
pitching, with junior right-hander 
Tommy Henry throwing seven 
shutout innings and redshirt 
right-hander 
freshman 
Isaiah 
Paige notching two of his own.
Saturday saw junior right-
hander Karl Kauffmann pitch 
10 strikeouts, only allowing one 
earned run. Freshman Willy 
Weiss finished the game with a 

clutch save, striking out the side 
after allowing a leadoff single.
Sunday was more of the same, 
as sophomore right-hander Jeff 
Criswell got the start, allowing 
only one run in five innings. 
A team of relievers showed 
the game out, headlined by 
sophomore left-hander Angelo 
Smith — who threw two innings 
with four strikeouts and one 
earned run, striking out two and 
getting a groundout after coming 
on with the bases loaded in the 
sixth inning.
Pitching, though, wasn’t the 
only thing going for Michigan. 
Holding a batting average of .315, 
the offense held its own. Sunday 
brought two triples, by Blomgren 
and redshirt senior Miles Lewis, 
and a homerun from sophomore 
catcher Joe Donovan.
“As a coaching staff we were 
really impressed with the balance 
of our offense with multiple 
threats throughout our lineup, 
one through nine,” Bakich said. 

“A combination of both speed and 
power. It’s just a tough lineup to 
get through.”
One offensive star of the 
weekend has to be Blomgren, 
who had five runs batted in — 
including the winning one on 
Saturday.
“He hit a huge triple today that 
really separated the game and 
what it means is that we’re really 
deep,” Bakich said. “He may be 
in the nine-hole in our team, but 
he might be in the two-hole or 
leadoff spot on another team.”
All of the Wolverines’ offensive 
production came without junior 
outfielder 
Dominic 
Clementi, 
who had a team high .368 batting 
average last year and was out with 
an abdominal sprain. Clementi is 
questionable for next weekend’s 
series against The Citadel.
Even so, this opening series 
could not have gone much better 
for Michigan, who has come out 
of the gates as fast as it could have 
hoped.

Pitching leads ‘M’ past Bearcats

In the top of the sixth inning 
on 
Sunday, 
Angelo 
Smith 
walked into the worst possible 
situation for a pitcher: bases 
loaded, nobody out. 
At 
least 
one 
run 
for 
Binghamton (0-3) seemed all 
but certain to everyone but 
the sophomore left-hander. 
Smith struck out his first two 
batters on six pitches and got 
his third batter to ground out 
on the next pitch to escape the 
jam. 
The 
No. 
17 
Michigan 
baseball 
team’s 
pitchers 
shut down the Bearcats this 
weekend in its season-opening 
series. Five of this weekend’s 
hurlers are still holding onto 
a perfect 0.00 earned run 
average. The Wolverines kept 
the Binghamton confused all 
weekend, holding it to six runs 
on the series. Michigan swept 

all three games, winning 10-0 
on Friday, 5-4 on Saturday and 
12-2 on Sunday. 
“Our three starters, Tommy 
Henry, Karl Kauffman and 
Jeff Criswell all gave us very 
solid outings and did a really 
good job of minimizing free 
passes,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “All of them did 
a great job of 
attacking 
the 
strike zone.” 
One 
particularly 
strong 
performance 
came 
from 
Tommy 
Henry, 
who 
started 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first game of 
2019 on Friday. The junior 
left-hander held Binghamton 
to six hits and no runs over 
a dominant six innings of 
work, striking out nine in the 

process. 
Michigan also saw strong 
performances 
in 
shorter-
inning 
stretches 
from 
its 
bullpen. Redshirt freshman 
right-hander 
Isaiah 
Paige 
allowed only a single hit and 
no runs over three innings 
of work out of the bullpen 
on Friday. Freshman right-
hander 
Willie 
Weiss 
earned 
his first career 
save 
in 
his 
first 
collegiate 
outing for the 
Wolverines. 
He struck out 
the side to end 
Saturday’s 
nail-biting 
contest 
and 
seal Michigan’s 
come-from-behind victory. 
“Striking out the side in his 
one inning on Saturday, Willie 
really showed some electric 
stuff,” Bakich said. “It was 
really great to see.”
Michigan’s 
pitching 
was 
so dominant that many of 
the hurlers got little or no 
work over the course of the 
weekend. Some of them will 
have to pitch in a scrimmage 
this week to reach their target 
number of innings pitched and 
stay on pace for the season-
long goals set for them by the 
coaching staff, according to 
Bakich. 
Though 
fewer 
of 
this 
year’s pitchers have in-game 
experience on the season so 
far, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
arms 
will be plenty rested for next 
weekend as the team heads 
down to Charleston, S.C. to 
face the Citadel. Many of the 
pitchers also have college 
experience behind them from 
previous seasons, so with 
almost a week’s rest before 
their next game, the pitching 
staff will look to put out 
another weekend of shutout 
work. 
“We certainly feel great 
about our veteran pitching 
staff,” Bakich said. “That they 
were able to give us three 
quality starts on the weekend 
– it was great to see.”

Behind Robbins, Wolverines beat 
Illinois for sixth-straight victory

Sunday 
afternoon 
in 
Champaign, Ill., two teams on 
very different trajectories crossed 
paths.
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team had won five 
consecutive games and was making 
its case for the NCAA Tournament. 
On the other hand, Illinois was on a 
downward spiral, having lost 13 of 
its last 15 contests.
And despite flashes were it 
appeared the Fighting Illini (2-13 
Big Ten, 10-16 overall) might get 
the upset they needed to change 
course, the Wolverines (9-6, 18-9) 
eventually pulled away with a 
70-56 victory.
After leading for the entire 
second quarter, Michigan’s grip 
on the game loosened early in the 
third. The Wolverines conceded 
two jumpers from off the left block 
— as well as a pair of free throws — 
and soon trailed, 30-29.
Michigan 
gave 
up 
seven 
offensive rebounds in that third 
frame, and as a result the game 
stayed close. But then junior 
forward Kayla Robbins — who 
finished with a team-high 15 points 
— stepped up, grabbing two steals 
and scoring seven points to give her 
team the breathing room it needed. 
From then on, the Wolverines 

widened the gap.
“Kayla Robbins is an incredible 
basketball player,” said Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 
to 
MGoBlueTV. “She does so many 
things that other players on 
our team don’t do. She has an 
incredible motor to the basketball, 
she rebounds the ball exceptionally 
well, she’s becoming more and 
more confident on the rip-and-go 
to the basket. She’s a great defender. 
She has great length and she’s just a 
great kid.
“She 
has 
been 
working 
incredibly hard lately and it’s so 
nice for her to be seeing a lot of 
positives and really impacting our 
team.”
The 
Wolverines 
had 
a 
meaningful moment in the first 
quarter, when senior center Hallie 
Thome scored from the post on a 
routine move. That basket made 
her the program’s third-ever player 
to reach 2000 points.
“Oh my goodness,” Barnes Arico 
said. “2000 points is incredible. 
That is not easy to do. 1000 is not 
easy to do. To have the ability to 
score 2000 over the course of your 
career is really special, and Hallie 
has been special to our program 
from the minute she stepped on 
campus. She’s just unstoppable.”
Early in the game, the Fighting 
Illini excelled from beyond the 
arc. They hit two triples in the first 

two minutes to take a 6-0 lead. By 
the first media timeout, they had 
notched a third and led 11-7.
When 
the 
timeout 
ended, 
Michigan’s streak began.
Freshman forward Naz Hillmon 
and Robbins checked in, and with 
them the Wolverines brought a 
near-full-court defensive press.
For a while, Illinois had no 
answer. 
The 
Fighting 
Illini 
struggled to make it to half court, 
and by the time they did there was 
often limited time left on the shot 
clock. This led to bad shots.
Michigan capitalized on the 
opportunity its defense provided, 
going on an 8-0 run to end the 
quarter. Robbins was crucial to 
that run, accounting for the latter 
half of those eight points to give her 
team a 15-11 lead.
In 
the 
second-frame, 
the 
Wolverines’ run continued. It 
topped off at 14-points, giving 
Michigan a 21-11 lead early in the 
stanza.
Illinois 
soon 
fought 
back 
though, led by forwards Alex 
Wittinger and Mackenzie Blazek. 
Wittinger converted a jumper and 
a triple. And then nearing the end 
of the half, Blazek hit back-to-back 
jumpers to cut the Wolverines’ lead 
to 29-24 by intermission.
But at the end of the day, the 
two teams continued in opposite 
directions.

Through the lens of Ann Arbor, a 
look at the race for the Big Ten

As the Michigan hockey team 
inches closer to postseason play, 
one thing is abundantly clear — the 
only way that it makes the NCAA 
Tournament is with an automatic.
The Wolverines currently sit 
at 25th in the Pairwise rankings, 
and according to College Hockey 
News’ Playoff Probability Matrix 
they have a zero percent chance of 
an at-large bid, even if they win out 
their last four games against Ohio 
State and Wisconsin.
But not all hope is lost. The 
Wolverines can still earn an 
automatic bid if they win the Big 
Ten Tournament. Besides Ohio 
State — which leads second-place 
Minnesota (33 points) by the same 
eight-point margin that the Golden 
Gophers lead last-place Wisconsin 
(25) — the second through seventh 
seeds in the tournaments are 
all essentially up for grabs. To 
guarantee home-ice for the three-
game series in the first round, 
Michigan must finish no lower 
than fourth. For the second-round 
game to be at Yost as well, it would 
have to finish second.
“It was disappointing you know, 
at Ohio State when you have the 
lead in the third period and played 
pretty well but made some bad 
mistakes in New York because 
you can’t get those points back,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

on Jan. 31 after splitting a home 
and neutral site series against 
Penn State. “And as you look at the 
standings, everything’s so tight. 
One game and you go from third 
place to seventh place.”
With the way the conference 
schedule is set up, there are likely 
four teams vying for the three 
home-ice spots in the first round: 
Minnesota, 
Notre 
Dame 
(31 
points), Michigan (30) and Penn 
State (29). Though Michigan State 
is close behind with 27 points, the 
Spartans only have one series to 
make up ground, while the three 
teams directly above them all 
have two. To make matters worse 
for the Spartans, that series is in 
Columbus.
As long as the Wolverines win 
at least one of its last four games 
or Michigan State loses one of its 
games to the Buckeyes, Michigan 
will finish above the Spartans. And 
if the Wolverines take one game 
against Wisconsin, that would 
put the Badgers at an eight-point 
deficit to Michigan — meaning 
that the Wolverines would be safe 
from slipping below Wisconsin if 
the Badgers lose at least one other 
game.
That is, by no means, is a given. 
Though Michigan picked up a win 
in Columbus themselves and could 
have walked out with a sweep if 
not for a third-period meltdown 
in the second game, Ohio State is 
currently the only Big Ten team 

in the top ten for a reason — it’s by 
far the most consistent team in the 
conference. Even Wisconsin gave 
Michigan all it could handle in two 
extra-time games at Yost.
It’s hard to imagine a scenario 
where the Wolverines lose out, so 
that likely leaves them jockeying 
for position with Penn State, 
Notre Dame and Minnesota. The 
calculus gets a little twisted from 
there — head to head, Michigan 
is tied with the Fighting Irish, 
up only one point to the Nittany 
Lions, and down one to the Golden 
Gophers. Notre Dame hosts Penn 
State and travels to Minnesota, but 
the Gophers play one series in the 
span while the other teams in the 
race all play two.
“It’s hard to make up points 
because 
everybody’s 
playing 
the same teams,” Pearson said. 
“Everybody is playing each other. 
Someone’s gonna win, someone’s 
gonna lose, so it’s important if you 
can string a sweep together.”
Still, any scenario where the 
Wolverines don’t get at least three 
points against the Buckeyes this 
weekend would likely spell doom 
for Michigan’s chances at second 
place. That, coupled with a Penn 
State 
sweep 
over 
Wisconsin, 
would drop the Wolverines to the 
No. 5 seed. However, a scenario 
where 
Michigan 
sweeps 
its 
season-ending slate would likely 
put it in a good position for the No. 
2 seed. 

Early trouble
Michigan drops three straight against North Carolina and Louisville in Big Ten/ACC Challenge, falls to 4-5 on season

Though Louisville and North 
Carolina didn’t seem to be the 
caliber of the Michigan softball 
team’s 
opening 
weekend 
opponents, 
the 
17th-ranked 
Wolverines 
knew 
they’d 
present a challenge. And, after 
a lackluster first tournament, 
it 
originally 
seemed 
like 
Michigan came ready to play in 
Chapel Hill, beating Louisville 
6-0 in its first game of the Big 
Ten/ACC Challenge.
“We were really on task, we 
were sharp, we were crisp, and 
we had a great energy about 
us,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins said. “When we got 
there, we were excited to get to 
play. I was very pleased, and I 
thought we had improved from 
week one to week two.”
But 
what 
seemed 
like 
a 
promising 
weekend 
of 
improvement 
turned 
sour 
quickly.
After the shutout win over 
Louisville on Friday, Michigan 
(4-5) mustered a measly six 
runs over the course of its next 
three games, losing the North 
Carolina (5-3), 8-3 and 4-2, 
respectively, while dropping 
a close one to Louisville (4-5), 
2-1.
“We need to start generating 
more 
offense 
in 
general, 
period,” Hutchins said. “We 
need more bases, we need 
better cuts. If we’re guilty of 
anything, there’s no question, 
it’s that we’re trying too hard. 
We’ve got some kids that have 
power, but we just want to hit 
the ball hard. We’re not there 
yet, but we’ll get there. It’s 
tough.”
Added senior catcher Katie 
Alexander: “Usually, hitting is 
contagious so, you know, I just 
got to keep trying to do what 
I can do for my team in any 
way possible to get on base. 
And again, mental toughness. 

Like softball is a game of ups 
and downs. Hitting 1-for-3 is 
good so we just have to string it 
together.”
The turning point of the 
weekend occurred during the 
fifth inning of game two. Tied 
at three, against the Tar Heels, 
sophomore left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien 
relieved 
freshman 
right-hander Alex Storako. The 
wheels couldn’t have fallen off 
any faster for the Wolverines. 
After giving up five earned 
runs, 
Beaubien 
was 
pulled 
within the same inning.
“We 
didn’t 
stay 
as 
competitive,” Hutchins said. “I 
don’t want to say (we lost) our 
confidence, but all of a sudden, 
we got tentative. You can’t. 
You’re in the middle of a game. 
When you’re getting outplayed, 
you can’t play tentatively. We 
can’t play tentatively, we can’t 
pitch tentatively, we can’t hit 
tentatively and we can’t play 
defense tentatively.”
That inning set the tone for 
the rest of the Big Ten/ACC 
Challenge for the Wolverines. 
After practicing how to hit with 
runners on base this past week, 
Michigan was unable to drive 

in runs and leaving several 
runners on base each game.
The 
Wolverines 
will 
undoubtedly 
drop 
in 
the 
rankings after losing three of 
four to unranked competition. 
But 
more 
than 
that, 
the 
weekend raised more questions 
than solved them.
With the starting first base 
job spot still up for grabs and 
junior third baseman Madison 
Uden getting benched toward 
the end of the weekend, the 
lineup is far from set according 
to Hutchins. But rather than 
building confidence for the 
next two tournaments that 
feature four of the top eight 
teams in the nation, Michigan 
has lost itself.
“We can’t really do anything 
about it now so we should 
be able to let it go and not 
be thinking about it next 
weekend,” Beaubien said. “We 
just need to focus on the games 
we have that are coming up and 
just really focus on all around, 
offensively, 
defensively, 
and 
in the circle. And not putting 
pressure on ourselves to get the 
results we want and just play 
softball like we know how.”

Rough waters have carried the 
No. 17 Michigan softball team 
into uncharted territory. Though 
the ship is far from wrecked, 
Wolverines’ 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins is looking to plug any 
leaks sooner rather than later.
After dropping three of its 
four games at the ACC/Big 
Ten Challenge, Michigan (4-5) 
returned to Ann Arbor with a 
sub-.500 record through at least 
five games for the first time since 
2001. The losing record isn’t 
the only issue the Wolverines 
brought back from Chapel Hill 
— mounted frustrations have 
manifested, too.
Right now, the vessel’s radar 
system is pointing to a number of 
different dangers.
“Our pitchers have a part 
to do, which is (execute) their 
process and limit the (opposing) 
offense,” Hutchins said. “Our 
defense’s job is to pick up the 
pitchers and take care of the 
ball. The offense’s job is to hit 
and score some runs. Right now, 
we’re not doing well in any of 
those categories.”
While 
Hutchins 
may 
be 
disappointed in the team’s overall 
performance, there are some 
positive takeaways outside of the 
turmoil. Michigan dominated 
Louisville, 6-0, Friday afternoon 
behind sophomore left-hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien’s 
one-hit 
shutout in its lone win of the 
weekend.
“We were really on task, we 
were sharp, we were crisp, and 
we had a great energy about us,” 
Hutchins said. “When we got 
there, we were excited to get to 
play. I was very pleased, and I 
thought we had improved from 
week one to week two.”
However, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
excitement was short lived.
Later that evening, the team 
was deadlocked with North 
Carolina going into the fifth 

inning. When freshman right-
hander 
Alex 
Storako 
began 
showing 
signs 
of 
fatigue, 
Hutchins turned to Beaubien to 
finish the game.
Moments 
later, 
the 
ship 
sustained its first gash. Beaubien 
was 
rocked 
for 
five 
runs, 
plummeting Michigan into an 
insurmountable 
deficit. 
The 
team’s enduring problem didn’t 
lie in the deficit — rather, the root 
of the issue came in the form of 
its passive response.
“We gave up too many free 
bases and five runs in an inning,” 
Hutchins said. “Hit batters, 
errors and they got ahold of 
a couple. We didn’t stay as 
competitive.
“I don’t want to say (we lost) 
our confidence, but all of a sudden 
we got tentative. You can’t. 
You’re in the middle of a game, 
when you’re getting outplayed, 
you can’t play tentatively. We 
can’t play tentatively, we can’t 
pitch tentatively, we can’t hit 
tentatively and we can’t play 
defense tentatively.”
When 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense faltered, they allowed 
the shortcomings to adversely 
affect them at the plate. After 

scoring six runs in the first game 
of the weekend, Michigan scored 
a combined total of six in the 
ensuing three losses.
“We need to start generating 
more 
offense 
in 
general,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“Period. 
We 
need more bases, we need better 
cuts. If we’re guilty of anything, 
there’s no question, it’s that 
we’re trying too hard. We’ve got 
some kids that have power, but 
we just want to hit the ball hard. 
We’re not there yet, but we’ll get 
there. It’s tough.”
After failing to seize two 
chances to capture early-season 
statement victories against No. 
5 Florida and No. 7 Arizona at 
last weekend’s Wilson-DeMarini 
Tournament, 
the 
Wolverines 
find themselves limping into an 
early crossroads.
Instead of pressing the panic 
button, Michigan is looking to 
use the experience to catalyze 
long-term growth.
“When you go through tough 
times, you’re meant to get 
tougher,” Hutchins said. “And 
that’s what it’ll do to you if you 
make the choice basically.”
For the Wolverines, the time 
to choose is now.

DeJulius gets his shot

David DeJulius took the court 
at Crisler with his first real 
opportunity all season.
Junior guard Zavier Simpson 
needed a spell in the Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s game 
against Maryland on Saturday, 
and DeJulius was the first guard 
off the bench. He played just 40 
seconds before subbing out, but 
with six-and-a-half minutes left 
in the first half, the freshman 
re-entered after Simpson got his 
second foul. He hit a layup and 
nabbed a steal two possessions 
later. He was in for four minutes 
this time, only coming out after 
missing a 3-pointer with 1:20 left.
It seems like a mundane 
accomplishment. But for much 
of the season, DeJulius was 
a 
little-used 
option, 
spotted 
mostly in long-decided games 
against the likes of George 
Washington, Chattanooga and 
Air Force. Entering when it was 
still anyone’s game, against a 
ranked conference team, as the 
first guard off the bench, is a 
far cry from garbage time. And 
afterward, 
Michigan 
coach 
John Beilein — not usually very 
forthcoming about playing time 
— hinted there may be more 
where that came from.
“It was a great layup,” Beilein 
said. “ … He’s been playing really 
well and we just said, you know 
what? We can use (sophomore 
guard Eli Brooks) in some ways, 
but it’s time for David right now 
to back up (Simpson).”
It 
was 
simultaneously 
a 

compliment of DeJulius and an 
indictment of Brooks. Halfway 
through the first period, Brooks 
had nothing but space in front of 
him and took what should have 
been an easy, uncontested jumper. 
It clanked off the front of the rim, 
the kind of shot of someone who’s 
lacking in confidence, who’s 
seemed hesitant to take a shot for 
the better part of the season.
But Beilein doesn’t just play 
freshmen in games like this. 
As he’s reiterated throughout 
the season, they have to earn it. 
DeJulius, it seems, has finally 
done so.
“I think Dave did a great 
job of coming in and relieving 
(Simpson) 
when 
he 
got 
in 
foul trouble,” said sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers. “Even 
when he had that left-to-right 
crossover, it kinda mimicked 
Zavier Simpson’s little hook, but 
it was a strong finish.”
This isn’t the first time Beilein 
has teased more playing time for 
freshmen. The previous times, it 
was only to go back to the tight 
seven-man rotation he’s used all 
year. But with more depth needed 
as the Wolverines approach the 
home stretch in Big Ten play and 
Brooks struggling, the time may 
have finally come for DeJulius to 
get his shot.
“He played great, played great 
defense, knocked down a little 
three o’clock (layup),” Simpson 
said. “We just need that sense of 
urgency if there’s an injury off 
the bench. I was happy to see him 
come in and just be vicious and 
demonstrate what he can bring to 
this team.”

Freshman guard David DeJulius was the first guard off the bench Saturday.

Back to normal 
Wolverines stave off comeback attempt, top Maryland 65-52
Isaiah Livers, Jon Teske lead the way against Terrapin bigs

After its season reached a 
nadir in a lethargic loss to Penn 
State on Tuesday, Michigan came 
into Saturday’s game against No. 
24 Maryland in desperate need 
of a cure for a month’s worth of 
offensive struggles.
So 
before 
tip-off, 
Isaiah 
Livers and Eli Brooks sat down 
to discuss what needed to go 
differently. The two eventually 
concluded that, to avoid a repeat 
of 
Tuesday 
— 
when 
the 
Nittany 
Lions’ 
first basket came 
just five seconds 
into 
the 
game 
— the emphasis 
needed to be on 
a strong start. 
That basket, they 
realized, 
had 
set the tone for 
the entire first 
half. By the time the Wolverines 
righted the ship, they were down 
16.
On 
Saturday 
afternoon 
though, it took nearly three 
minutes for the Terrapins to 
score. Before they could do so for 
a second time, Michigan’s lead 
had ballooned to 12. Maryland 
(19-7 overall, 10-5 Big Ten) 
eventually reversed course, but 
— much like for the Wolverines 
on Tuesday — it was too late, as 
Michigan (23-3, 12-3) held on to 
win, 65-52.
“We built too big of a hole,” 
said 
Maryland 
coach 
Mark 
Turgeon. “Against a great team, 
you can’t do that.”
When Livers caught a pass 
in transition and slammed over 
Anthony Cowan with 7:11 to 
play in the first half, the game 
appeared over. Michigan had 
already raced out to a 23-8 lead, 
displaying the type of fireworks 
that have evaded it for much of 
the past two months.
“Everybody 
was 
really 

focused, everybody was locked 
in, everybody was active,” Livers 
said. “We had six shutouts — 
that’s three stops in a row — in 
the first half, so that’s really good 
for us.”
The early barrage came on 
the back of jump shooting and 
transition baskets — two areas 
in which Michigan has struggled 
in recent weeks. But then, the 
struggles of the Wolverines’ 
midseason lull resurfaced.
After a Livers three midway 
through the first half, they didn’t 
hit 
another 
one until four 
minutes 
after 
the 
break. 
The 
transition 
offense, 
too, 
dried up after 
that 
opening 
spell.
“We 
created 
13 turnovers in 
the first half,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “We stopped 
creating turnovers so now we 
had to dial up plays and get more 
into a half-court thing.”
As Michigan stagnated, the 
Terrapins found their groove. 
Just four minutes after Livers’ 
dunk 
put 
the 
exclamation 
mark on a dominant opening 
stretch, back-to-back 3-pointers 
from Aaron Wiggins cut the 
Wolverines’ lead to a precarious 
nine-point advantage.
For the first nine minutes 
of 
the 
second 
half, 
that’s 
where it remained, fluctuating 
between six and 11 — Michigan 
threatening to pull away and 
Maryland threatening to pull 
even, but neither coming to 
fruition. But when Serrel Smith 
Jr. buried a pull-up triple to cut 
the deficit to three with 10:21 
to play, it seemed the latter had 
come to pass.
The Wolverines — just an 
hour after their most dominant 
stretch in months — were en 
route to their most crushing loss 

of the season.
Then, as he so often does, 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
provided a much-needed spark, 
darting into the lane in transition 
and eurostepping past a helpless 
Maryland defender to extend 
Michigan’s lead back to double 
digits. 
One 
possession 
later, 
junior guard Zavier Simpson 
hit just the Wolverines’ second 
three of the half, sending the 
Crisler Center into a frenzy and 
re-establishing Michigan’s eight-
point advantage.
“Any three that we hit in the 
second (half) — whether it was 
(Ignas Brazdeikis)’, (Jon Teske)’s, 
Zavier’s — they were just huge 
to get us back,” Beilein said. “It 
was going south pretty quick. 
We couldn’t get anything to go 
and they were getting really easy 
shots.”
The 
Terrapins 
never 
got 
the deficit back within one 
possession, giving Michigan a 
win that may look easy on the 
stat sheet but was, in reality, 
anything but.
After Tuesday’s episode in 
State College, the Wolverines 
will take it.

John Beilein and Luke Yaklich 
had a message for Isaiah Livers.
A matchup with Maryland 
was coming up. The sophomore 
forward knew he would be called 
upon to back up the ‘4’ and ‘5’ 
positions. And the Terrapins 
happen to have two talented big 
men — chief among them Bruno 
Fernando, a 6-foot-10 behemoth 
who affects both ends of the 
court.
Livers, 
meanwhile, 
had 
lingering 
regrets 
about 
the 
last game the Michigan men’s 
basketball team faced a team 
with two physical bigs. On Feb. 1, 
the Wolverines lost in Iowa City 
as Livers found himself in foul 
trouble, playing just 14 minutes 
and forcing freshmen Brandon 
Johns and Colin Castleton to be 
thrown in the fire. Then, Livers 
couldn’t help his team nearly as 
much as he wanted.
Facing Maryland, Beilein and 
Yaklich told him what had to 
change.
“(Yaklich) and (Beilein) said 
I can’t outmuscle big guys with 

small ball,” Livers said. “You 
gotta move your feet and kinda 
just trick them. Trick the guy 
passing it.”
Combined, Livers and junior 
center Jon Teske — a more 
traditional big — held Fernando 
to zero points in the first half. 
Terrapins forward Jalen Smith, 
meanwhile, had six at the ‘4’ 
position, four of which came 
with freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis guarding him.
But in the second half, the 
nine-point lead the Wolverines 
had 
built 
up 
started 
to 
dissipate. In the 
first five minutes, 
Fernando scored 
a hook shot, a 
dunk and a layup 
— then got Teske 
his second foul. 
Teske, who had 
just two points 
up 
until 
then, 
came out.
In many games, that would 
have been where it unraveled — 
especially when Johns, Teske’s 
replacement, instantly picked up 
two fouls on the same possession. 

But Beilein took the risk and put 
Teske back in along with Livers.
After 
that, 
Fernando 
had 
six points, Smith had two and 
Michigan had a 65-52 win.
“I wasn’t fouling,” Livers said. 
“And I wasn’t wrapping my arm 
around him, just holding him.”
At Iowa, forwards Luka Garza, 
Tyler Cook and Ryan Kreiner 
combined for 41 points while 
Teske, Livers and Brazdeikis 
combined for 12 fouls.
On Saturday — when Fernando 
and Smith had 20 points and the 
combination 
of 
Teske, 
Brazdeikis 
and 
Livers had just 
six fouls — the 
Wolverines 
found the right 
balance.
“We’ve 
learned to play 
more 
physical,” 
Beilein said. “… 
Our losses have 
taught us we can play physical 
without fouling. At Iowa, we 
were in foul trouble immediately 
and that put us behind the eight-
ball.”
And when Teske did get in foul 
trouble, Livers was there. Taking 
what he learned on a bad night 
against the Hawkeyes, he sent his 
own message to Maryland: You 
won’t be able to take advantage.
“When I get in there, I don’t try 
to outmuscle Bruno Fernando,” 
Livers said. “I try to move my 
feet around and just make him 
uncomfortable. I did that, it was 
like three times and he just threw 
it away because he got scared 
and threw it all the way out of 
bounds.”
Coming in, the Terrapins — a 
top-25 team who Beilein sees as 
a contender in March — looked 
like a bad matchup. But Beilein 
contended that their combination 
of bigs was nothing Michigan 
hadn’t seen before.
Livers and Teske proved him 
right.

Walk before you run: ‘M’ tries to rediscover break

The Michigan men’s basketball 
team takes its time on offense.
The Wolverines have finished 
higher than 285th in offensive 
tempo just twice in 12 seasons 
under 
John 
Beilein. 
Low 
turnover rates depress their 
tempo somewhat, but this has 
never been a team that seeks to 
fly past you.
Instead, Michigan is more 
like a viper waiting to strike 
its 
unsuspecting 
prey. 
The 
Wolverines ranked among the top 
five percent of teams in transition 
efficiency in each of the last three 
seasons, per UM Hoops.
This season?
“Sometimes, 
fast 
break, 
we shouldn’t even do it,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
after a 59-57 win over Minnesota 
on Jan. 22. “Because we’re 
jogging up the court. We gotta 
sprint. We don’t run.”
The Wolverines scored 19 fast 
break points on Jan. 10 against 
Illinois, but that was heavily 
aided by the Fighting Illini’s 
pressure defense and accelerated 
tempo. Leading into Saturday’s 
game 
against 
Maryland, 
Michigan hadn’t scored more 
than 10 since. Its normally lethal 
fast break has been, at best, 
average this year, and often much 
worse. And Beilein’s let them 
know it.
“They see the analytics on 
it, that we’re a very middling 
offense in transition,” Beilein 
said Saturday. “We showed them 
stats from other years, and I said, 
‘We’re doing the exact same 
thing.’ ... We didn’t change our 
game plan, so this one’s not on 
the coaching staff right now. This 
is on you.”
It’s not as if this game plan 
— Beilein’s only rules are “get 
wide, make sure we fill some 
lanes” — reinvents the wheel, 
either. Michigan has excelled 
in transition for years by taking 
elementary 
concepts 
and 
executing them at a high level.
But while that has done 
wonders for the Wolverines in 
the past, that might be part of 
the problem this year. Simplicity 

and ease are not the same, but 
the difference between them is 
deceptive, and that difference 
may have deceived Beilein — 
who regrets that he didn’t drill 
his team more on core concepts 
during the summer.
“I shouldn’t have taken that for 
granted that people understand 
how to get wide when we really 
didn’t,” he said. “That’s on me.”
Thus, the past two weeks 
have been something of a crash 
course in transition offense, 
according to junior guard Zavier 
Simpson. On Saturday, Simpson 
reiterated that the keys to finding 
a transition groove are simple.
“Finding the open lanes, just 
to get hit and (Beilein has) been 
on our wings about running,” 
Simpson said. “I just tell my 
wings just to run and I’ll find 
you.”
If 
this 
understanding 
comes 
around, 
Michigan 
— 
with a premier distributor in 
Simpson, an ace shooter in 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole, 
and 
athletic 
mismatches 
in 
redshirt junior guard Charles 
Matthews, freshman forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis and sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers — has the 
tools to be one of Beilein’s better 
transition offenses.
The seeds of that were on 
display against the Terrapins. 

After a blocked shot, Brazdeikis 
led the break and found Poole, 
who circled under the rim and 
hit Simpson for a wide-open, 
catch-and-shoot 3-pointer for the 
game’s first points. Brazdeikis 
notched a transition triple of 
his own a minute later, and 
Matthews scored four points off 
fast break passes from Simpson 
and Brazdeikis in a 14-2 start for 
the Wolverines.
Maryland’s offense has ball-
security issues, ranking second to 
last in Big Ten games in turnover 
rate. Michigan took advantage, 
scoring 10 of its 27 first-half 
points on the fast break thanks to 
13 Terrapin giveaways. Maryland 
threatened in the second half as 
the Wolverines slowed down, but 
a smooth transition take by Poole 
off Livers’ outlet, followed by a 
Simpson pull-up three, kept the 
Terrapins at bay.
All told, Michigan finished 
with its most fast-break points 
(14) in over a month.
“We were playing at a clip that 
was incredible,” Beilein said. “We 
were getting stops and we were 
running. ... (In the second half) 
we stopped creating turnovers, 
so now we had to dial up plays 
and get more into a halfcourt 
thing.”
Brazdeikis 
and 
Livers, 
in 
particular, could hold the key to 

Michigan’s fast-break Ferrari. 
Both play most of their minutes 
at the ‘4’ position but have the 
talent and athleticism to hold 
their 
own 
elsewhere. 
This 
includes transition, where their 
versatility can discombobulate a 
defense unsure how to match up 
with them.
“It was sometimes where I 
was even leading the break and 
I was like, ‘Wow,’ ” Livers said. 
“… That’s great for us. Especially 
Iggy — Iggy had like two assists 
on transition. He loves when 
four-men push the ball because 
it’s really hard to guard because 
the other four-man’s not gonna 
guard the four in transition, so 
it’s kind of liking having a lot of 
guards out there. It felt different.”
Added 
Beilein: 
“It’s 
very 
hard to guard a bust out four. 
Somebody’s gonna take him, it 
means now … the point guard is 
being guarded by a four in space 
and that’s usually good.”
On Saturday, the Wolverines 
weren’t 
quite 
the 
deadly 
transition offense they’ve been in 
years past. But they looked closer 
than at any point this season 
— and with Michigan having 
broken 70 points only once in its 
last nine games, and 80 only once 
since Dec. 8, an improved fast 
break might be just what it needs 
to get its offense back on track.

Everybody 
was locked in, 
everybody was 
active.

You gotta move 
your feet and 
kinda just trick 
them.
