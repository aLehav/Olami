CHANGES AT RACKHAM
Enrollment
policy for
grads to get
overhaul

Ph.D. candidates to
stay enrolled from
matriculation to
graduation
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
While many undergraduate
students worry about whether
tuition will be raised next year,
Ph.D. candidates at the Univer-
sity may not have to worry about
anything.
A current proposal advocat-
ing continuous enrollment for
Ph.D. candidates would require
a student to register every
semester, from matriculation to
degree completion. It is expect-
ed to benefit students through
increased student flexibility,
lower tuition rates and uninter-
rupted access to University ser-
vices and resources.
In a presentation to the
Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs earlier
this week, Rackham Graduate
School Dean Janet Weiss out-
lined the proposal and defended
it against criticism from several
members of SACUA.
Weiss said a continuous
enrollment policy is standard at
most research universities, and
that switching to such a policy
could lead to higher graduation
rates.
"Our real goal is to make it
more likely that students will be
able to complete their degrees

and go on to successful careers
beyond graduate school," she
said. "The money is really only
the means to the end."
In her presentation, Weiss
called the proposal revenue
neutral, saying the current
enrollment system generates
$26 million in tuition, which
she expects will be unchanged
- despite lower tuition rates.
"The answer to the question
'Can we afford to do this?' is
yes, we think we can afford to
do it," she said. "We obviously
can afford that because we're
doing it."
The proposal would lowerthe
average Ph.D. candidate tuition
rate from $5,800 per semester
to $4,750 per semester. At the
same time, the proposal would
increase student enrollment
by 600 students, from approxi-
mately 2,200 students to 2,800
students. The increase in stu-
dents is expected to recover the
loss of revenue from a decreased
tuition rate.
Despite the lower tuition
rate, most Ph.D. students would
not notice the difference, since
many candidates have their
tuition paid for by a third party.
"Many of our Ph.D. students,
in fact almost all of our Ph.D.
students, are paid for from a
University source," Weiss said.
"That is, they don't pay their
own tuition."
Weiss said most schools at
the University would not notice
financial changes as a result
of the proposal but said a few

Former University athlete Mike Milano (right) and his attorney John Shea listen to District Judge Elizabeth Pollard Hines at his preliminary hearing yesterday.
Miano to stand trial for assaut

Judge ruled that
prosecutor provided
enough evidence to
warrant trial
By TREVOR CALERO
Daily News Editor
In a preliminary hearing yester-
day, District Judge Elizabeth Pollard
Hines ordered Mike Milano - the
former Michigan athlete accused of
assaulting a hockey player last fall -
to stand trial for the incident.
After hearing testimonies from
Milano's former wrestling coach
and an additional eyewitness, Hines
ruled that the prosecutor provided
enough evidence to warrant a trial.
Steve Kampfer, a junior defense-
man on the hockey team, sustained

head and neck injuries after an
alleged altercation with Milano on
a Church Street sidewalk near East
Quad Residence Hall on the morn-
ing of Oct. 12.
Milano, a former wrestler and
walk-on running back for the foot-
ball team, will stand trial for the
charge of assault with intent to
commit great bodily harm less than
murder. If a jury finds him guilty,
Milano could face up to 10 years in
prison and a $5,000 fine.
At yesterday's hearing, LSA senior
Nicholas Nedic, who was coming
home from a club on the night of
the incident, testified that he heard
"loud, aggressive talking" as he was
walking down Church Street.
After hearing the commotion,
Nedic said he looked to his right and
saw "one man pick up another man
... and drive him into the ground."
He saidhe then heard "a loud crack,"

like the sound of a "skull hitting
pavement."
Milano's attorney John Shea
said in an interview after the hear-
ing that he was heartened to hear
Nedic's testimony, which he said
confirmed that the confrontation
was face-to-face, and not a "sneak
attack from behind."
Shea said this is an important
distinction because it corroborates
with the testimony of Mike Ander-
son, Kampfer's friend who was with
him the night of the incident.
The fact that Milano picked
Kampfer up from the front, Shea
said, proves he was performing a
basic wrestling move to subdue him.
Wrestling Coach Joe McFarland,
who recruited and coached Milano
for two years before Milano quit to
join the football team, talked at the
hearing about the sport of wrestling
and his relationship with the defen-

dant.
After being told of the incident
as witnesses described it, McFar-
land confirmed that it sounded like
a common move - a double-leg
takedown - that wrestlers are usu-
ally taught early in their wrestling
careers.
"It's important to have it
ingrained so it becomes instinctive,"
McFarland testified. "(The move) is
not designed to cause injury."
Shea said after the hearing that
he was glad to hear McFarland con-
firm that the physical maneuver
appeared to be a wrestling move.
"I think that it is significant that
Mike didn't punch (Kampfer) or
kick him, or knee him or elbow
him," Shea said. "He employed a
wrestling move that he has been
taught and drilled until it's second
nature to him."

Michigan lands top-ten class on Signing Day

With 22 recruits,
class ranks No. 7 in

By ANDY REID
Managing Sports Editor
It's been awhile since a Michi-
gan football press conference was
a high-spirited occasion. During
the Wolverines' program-record
nine loss season last year, Michi-
gan assistant coaches and players
found it harder and harder to field
the media's questions as the sea-
son dragged on.
But inside the Junge Fam-
ily Champions Center yesterday
afternoon, the atmosphere was
decidedly different.
With a relaxed and energetic
tone, Michigan football coach
Rich Rodriguez announced the
members of his second recruit-
ing class since taking the reins in
Ann Arbor. The Wolverines signed
22 incoming freshman - seven of
whom are already enrolled at the
University and currently working
out with strength and condition-
ing coach Mike Barwis - in a class
that currently rates No. 7 in the
nation on recruiting site Rivals.

Peace rally at the Big House

It was no ordinary half-
timeshowattheP1971home-
coming football game.
That Saturday afternoon,
the announcer asked the
crowd of 75,000 fans for a
moment of silence to honor
those who died in the Viet-
nam War, asuwell as the lives
that would stillibe lost.
Fifty war veterans, who
had lined the east sideline,
then released 100 black
balloons to symbolize the
1.5 million victims lost
in the war,: as the march-
ing band played "Taps,"
according to "War as
They Knew It," a book by
Michael Rosenberg.
University officials
agreed to allow the anti-
war observance during
halftime after they were
presented with a petition

signed by 1,500 people. But
they stipulated that band
members and the local
chapter of Vietnam Veter-
ans Against the War could
be the only people allowed
on the field.
Signatures supporting
the petitionfromtwo-thirds
of the football team, howev-
er, presented some conflicts
in the locker room.
Bo Schembechler, the
University's head foot-
ball coach at the time, was
concerned that the dem-
onstration would be too
distracting. In his eyes,
there was no place for it at
a Michigan football game.
Many viewed the 1971
homecoming theme,"Bring
all the troops home now.
Let's have a real homecom-
ing this year," as a success.

Spectators at the game
commented that the
unusual halftime show was
"an emotional experience
in good taste."
Marvin Epstein, an alum
who watched the show, told
the Daily at the time that
the "fantastic" halftime
festivities allowed the Uni-
versity to distinguish itself
from other colleges.
Though University Sec-
retary Richard Kennedy
and Schembechler were
concerned that mixing
football and politics could
be a distraction, the peace-
ful halftime show went off
without a hitch.
In the end, the football
team was unfazed by the
interruption, winning 61-7
over Indiana.

WASHINGTON
Obama signs bill
extending SCHIP
President Barack Obama has
signed a bill extending health
coverage to 4 million uninsured
children.
The East Room signing cer-
emony yesterday represented
a much-needed win for Obama
on health care a day after his
administration suffered a major
setback with the loss of his nom-
inee to lead his drive for sweep-
ing reform, Tom Daschle.
The bill went to the White
House fresh from passage in the
Democratic-controlled House,
on a vote of 290-135.
The bill calls for spending an
additional $32.8 billion on the
State Children's Health Insur-
ance Program. Lawmakers gen-
erated that revenue by raising
the federal tobacco tax. Obama
said it is a key step toward his
promise of universal health care
coverage for all.
ANNAPOLIS, Md.
Lawmakers push
for voters to fill
Senate vacancies
Amid allegations that former
Illinois Coy. Rod Blagojevich
tried to sell President Barack
Obama's U.S. Senate seat, state
lawmakers across the country
are pushing to give voters - not
governors - the power to fill
similar vacancies.
Lawmakers in Illinois, Mary-
land, Rhode Island, Minnesota,
Connecticut, Colorado and New
York have introduced bills to
require special elections for open
Senate seats.
Though such elections could
be time-consuming and costly
- Minnesota officials estimate a
statewide special election there
would cost $3.5 million and
Maryland officials say they'd
need about four months for one
- supporters argue the choice
should be left to voters.
"An appointment by a gover-
nor warps the normal democrat-
ic process in that one voter - the
governor - gets to choose who
gets to be a senator," sa51 rf ~
land Delegate Saqib Ali, who
was inspired by what he calls the
"Blagojevich imbroglio" to intro-
duce a bill in his state.

FBI searches home
of man linked to
tTylenol deaths
Federal agents yesterday
searched the home of a man
linked to the fatal 1982 Tylenol
poisonings in the Chicago area
thattriggered anationwide scare
and prompted dramatic changes
in the way food and medical
products are packaged.
No one was ever charged with
the deaths of seven people who
took the cyanide-laced drugs.
The FBI would not immediately

confirm that the search at the
home of James. W. Lewis was
related to the Tylenol case, only
that it was part of an ongoing
investigation.
Lewis served more than 12
years in prison for sending an
extortion note to Johnson &
Johnson demanding $1 million
to "stop the killing."

Obama fights
stimulus critics

President Barack Obama watches as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner speaks about executive compensation yesterday in
the Grand Foyer at the White House in Washington.
Obama caps salaries
of bailout recipients

Dem. leaders pledge
to have legislation
ready by next week
WASHINGT'ON(AP)-Politeyet
pointed, President Barack Obama
pushed back against Republican
critics of the economic stimulus
legislation making its way through
Congress yesterday at the same
time he reached across party lines
to consider changes in the bill.
"Let's not make the perfect the
enemy of the essential," Obama
said as Senate Republicans
stepped up their criticism of the
bill's spending and pressed for
additional tax cuts and relief for
homeowners. He warned that fail-
ure to act quickly "will turn crisis
into a catastrophe and guarantee
a longer recession."
Democratic leaders have pledged
tohavelegislationreadyforObama's
signature by the end of next week,
and they concede privately they
will have to accept some spending
reductions along the way.
"This bill needs to be cut down,"
Republican Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky said on the Senate floor.

He cited $524 million for a State
Department program that he said
envisions creating 388 jobs. "That
comes to $1.35 million per job," he
added.
Republicans readied numer-
ous attempts to reduce the cost of
the $900 billion measure, which
includes tax cuts and new spend-
ing designed to ignite recovery
from the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression.
But after days of absorbing rhe-
torical attacks, Obama and Senate
Democrats mounted a counterof-
fensive against Republicans who
say tax cuts alone can cure the
economy.
Obama said the criticisms he
has heard "echo the very same
failed economic theories that led
us into this crisis in the first place,
the notion that tax cuts alone will
solve all our problems."
"I reject those theories, and so
did the American people when
they went to the polls in Novem-
ber and voted resoundingly for
change," said the president, who
was elected with an Electoral Col-
lege landslide last fall and enjoys
high public approval ratings atthe
outset of his term.

President imposes
$500,000 cap on
senior exec. pay
WASHINGTON(AP)-President
Barack Obama yesterday imposed a
$500,000 cap on senior executive
pay for the most distressed finan-
cial institutions receiving taxpayer
bailout money and promised new
steps to end a system of "executives
being rewarded for failure."
Obama announced the unusual
government intervention into cor-
porate America at the White House,
with Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner at his side. The president
said the executive-pay limits are
a first step, to be followed by the
unveiling next week of a sweeping
new framework for spending what
remains of the $700 billion finan-
cial industry bailout that Congress

created last year.
The pay limitcomes amid a nation-
al outcry over huge bonuses to execu-
tives who head companies that seek
taxpayer dollars to remain afloat. The
demand for limits was reinforced by
revelations that Wall Streetfirms paid
more than $18 billion in bonuses in
2008 amid the economic down-
turn and the massive infusion of
taxpayer dollars.
The limit would apply to top-
paid executives at the most dis-
tressed financial institutions
that are negotiating bailout
agreements with the federal
government. It also would apply
to other banks that receive aid,
but they could get around the
limits by publicizing to share-
holders plans to exceed the sal-
ary cap.
The limits would not apply
retroactively to any bank that
received money from the first

half of the $700 bailout allocatedby
Congress. For example, the restric-
tion would not apply to such firms
as American International Group
Inc., Bank of America Corp., and
Citigroup Inc., that already have
received such help.


Salazar scraps sale of
Utah oil-and-gas lease

Interior secretary
reverses Bush decision
on 77 parcels of
federal land
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - In a
high-profile reversal of the Bush
administration, Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar said yesterday the gov-
ernment is scrapping the lease of 77
parcels of federal land for oil and gas
drilling in Utah's redrock country.
"In the last weeks in office, the
Bush administration rushed ahead
to sell oil and gas leases near some
of our nation's most precious land-
scapes in Utah," Salazar said from
Washington in a teleconference
call with reporters.
He ordered the Bureau of Land
Management, which is part of the
Interior Department, to not cash
checks from winning bidders for
parcels at issue in a lawsuit filed by
environmental groups.
The sales were worth $6 million

to the government in addition to
royalties on any oil or gas pro-
duction.
"We will take time and a fresh
look at these 77 parcels to see if
they are appropriate for oil and
gas development," Salazar said.
A federal judge put the sale of
the 77 parcels on hold last month
until the lawsuit was resolved.
Now, Salazar is refusing to sell
any of them - at least until the
new administration has a chance
to take a second look.
Conservation groups prom-
ised to press ahead with the
lawsuit to challenge long-term

Low-income living
Affordable housing needed by students and residents alike
orget struggling with classes or trying to balance extracur-
ricular activities, one of the most intimidating aspects of
college is trying to find reasonably priced housing within
walking distance of Central Campus. Across the city, exorbitant
rent has left students and permanent residents in a tough finan-
cial spot. For residents, however, that problem could be alleviated
if a new proposal to convert three downtown city parking lots into
low-income housing is executed. More low-income housing for Ann
Arbor residents is definitely a good thing, but the city shouldn't for-
get about its students. Initiatives to provide students with the same
kind of affordable housing should also be in the works.

all standing in one corner.!

ndigen ous empowerment

Community development officials from
the city of Ann Arbor and Washtenaw
County recently proposed conversion of
three parking lots to create between 60 and
100 low-income units. These units would be
targeted at people who make 10 to 15 per-
cent of the area's median income of $51,232.
That would include many of the permanent
city residents unable to afford the rising rent
across }the city Though expected to cost
between $6.3 and $14.7 million, federal tax
credits would cover approximately 80 per-
cent of building expenses - and the city has
students to thank for that.
The city is eligible for much of its federal
funding due to the fact that students are
included in the federal census. The presence
of students makes the average city income
appear lower than it actually is because
many students are dependent on their par-
ents and, on paper, have no income. This
lowers the city's average income and the city
can receive more federal dollars. So if the
city is going to profit from the presence of
students in Ann Arbor, students should be
benefiting as well.
Though rising rent is the result of stu-
dents' willingness to pay up, what students
really need is affordable housing close to
campus. And recent developments like 601

Forest have done little to ease the pressure
on students' bank accounts or demonstrate
that the city is ready to get serious about
affordable housing. It's time for the city to
step in and give students the same options
it wants to give residents - after all, the stu-
dents are partly the cause of these federal
dollars.
Ann Arbor residents and students all
need and deserve more low-income hous-
ing. Close, affordable housing has benefits
of all sorts. In cities like Ann Arbor, lim-
ited mass transit options necessitate living
close to the city. Low-income families can't
afford to move further out to find lower rent
when they still have to commute to the city.
Plus, if financially disadvantaged people are
forced to live further and further away from
campus it segregates Ann Arbor by income.
Local, affordable housing also has other
advantages, like decreasing the need for car
traffic, clearing busy streets and helping the
environment.
The proposal could provide some resi-
dents with the housing they need. But that
only solves part of the problem - students
make up an important part of the city and
their needs have to be considered. The city
government should spend some of those fed-
eral dollars on helping us out, too.

olivia, the poorest nation in
South America, is on the verge
of adopting a new constitution.
After approximate-
ly 500 years of rule
by Europeans and
their descendants,
the country elected
its first indigenous
president, Evo
Morales, in 2006.
Morales has since 3
worked to remove
the inequalities IBRAHIIM
stemming from the KAKWAN
concentration of
land and resources
in the hands of a
few wealthy families. You may be
thinking, 'That's great, but for those
of us who are not Bolivian, why does
this matter?'
The most immediate answer is
natural resources. As the supply of oil
becomes increasingly unstable and
consumers seek greener alternatives
to gasoline power, lithium ion batter-
ies are expected to take on a greater
share of the power storage burden.
Bolivia has approximately 50 percent
of the-world's lithium reserves, along
with a sizeable amount of the world's
tungsten, tin, antimony, and others
- many of which are used in the cre-
ation of steel.
Companies including BMW, Mit-
subishi and Michigan-based General
Motors are currently developing elec-
tric cars that rely on lithium batteries;
the GM Volt is slated to be released
next year, and cell phones and laptops
already use them. At a time when car
buyers are few, lower lithium prices
would contribute to a lower over-
all cost for the new electric cars and
potentially drive higher sales.
Unfortunately, the leftward lean-
ings of the Bolivian government have
made it difficult for foreign compa-
nies to tap that country's mineral
resources, and given the complexity
of lithium refinement, the Bolivians
are not in a position to undertake the
task alone on any great scale. In 2006,

Morales announced the national-
ization of oil and gas. As recently as
January 23,,the Bolivian government
took control of a BP subsidiary. This
will earn the government additional
revenues, but given the potential for
a nearly total loss of investments, few
new companies are willing to venture
into Bolivia. The resources lay unused
while Bolivia and potential investors
lose.
The seeming justice of nationaliza-
tion, indigenous empowerment and
land redistribution after hundreds of
years of oppression is understandable
but impractical. Saul Villegas, the
official in charge of lithium extrac-
tion, only highlights the ridiculous-
ness of the government's position;
"Maybe there could be the possibil-
ity of foreigners accepted as minority
partners, or better yet, as our clients,"
he told the New York Times this
week. Bolivian miners are currently
loading salt into trucks with shovels,
and the government expects foreign
companies to set up the industry, only
to become minority partners while
risking nationalization.
Bolivia's indigenous populationhas
had a longer period of exploitation
than many other indigenous people,
partially bankrolling Spain for hun-
dreds of years and then the Euro-
pean-descended Bolivian elite after
the country gained independence.
But taking back the country and its
resources overnight is not a good idea,
nor does it excuse wishful thinking.
Granted, "imperialist" resource
exploitation agreements impose
unfair terms on the hostcountries, but
they work in the long run to develop
their economies. These agreements
are what fueled the growth of the
Middle Eastern oil kingdoms. When
the sheikhs were rich in oil but lacked
capital and drilling experience, these
imperialist agreements helped to
transform the oil under their feet into
the cash that their nations were built
upon.
Bolivia's new constitution incorpo-
rates a land redistribution program

that will wrest control of hundreds of
square miles of land from the wealthy
and transfer it to the state 'and the
poor, but this will also destroy some
of the country's most productive
farms. On the surface, indigenous
empowerment may seem like a good
thing. But after years of operating far
behind modern methods of efficiency,
empowerment will hurt the fragile
economy of Bolivia, which is already
in decline due to tumbling metal pric-
es. Of course, it is the "empowered"
(i.e., the indigenous people) who will
suffer most and who may end up
worse off than they were before.
Nationalizing
industries can kill
a new economy.
Take the case of Zimbabwe. After
the black majority took control of the
country (then called Rhodesia) from
the white minority in 1980, various
black African factions engaged in a
civil war. In the early 1990s, the coun-
try was gripped by political turmoil
with state employees striking over
low wages. By 1997, 36 percent of the
population had HIV, and the land
redistribution of 2000 transformed
the country from a model of African
agricultural efficiency into the site of
a cholera outbreak and home of the
$100 trillion Zimbabwean bill.
A large part of Zimbabwe's plight
is due to mismanagement and corrup-
tion, but a sense of entitlement along
ethnic and national lines helped it to
take root.
Luckily for Morales and Bolivia,
Chavez and his oil money are there
to help if the going gets tough. In the
meantime, I'll have to pay more for
that new laptop battery.

ELISE BAUNve eitT
Give credit where credit is due

I

In light of the recent economy,
some Michigan students who decided
to attend college out-of-state might
find themselves regretting that deci-
sion. To help them out, the University
is considering re-admitting them as
transfer students and allowing them
to pay in-state tuition. This would be
a nice gesture if it actually alleviated
some financial woes. But in reality,
transfer students often have to repeat
too many credits to make this a practi-
cal solution.
Prospective transfer students can
determine which of their credits will
transfer by looking it up online, but
the first problem with the process is
that the website is nearly impossible
to find. When students do find it, they
will learn that the University claims
C grades or higher in their classes are
likely to successfully transfer. Unfor-
tunately, this is misleading.
Many students who attempt to
transfer to the University find them-
selves needing to repeat courses that
they've already taken - something
to do with other college classes not
matching up to the University of
Michigan's caliber, I suppose.
And credits that do transfer might
not actually fulfill distribution or
concentration requirements, instead
only counting toward the 120 credits
needed to graduate. The decision on
whether or not to aqcept the credits is

based on how the course description
at the old university compares to the
classes offered here. If the descrip-
tion is close enough, the credits might
transfer.
Since many students wind up need-
ing to retake courses based on this
system, they end up staying longer at
the University. Transfers will end up
spending so much money and extra
time that they may wish they should
have just stayed at their original col-
leges. It's unrealistic to assume that
allowing more students to transfer
will help them with theii troubles.
It's not just the problem of students
needing to repeat courses. If students
received Advanced Placement credit
at the university they were originally
attending and then took courses above
that level, they may still have to take
introductory courses here because the
AP score threshold for college credit
won't necessarily match up.
One of my friends went to Michi-
gan Tech, took upper-level physics
courses and wanted to transfer to the
University of Michigan to enroll in
the aerospace engineering program.
Unfortunately, his AP score doesn't
count here, so he would have had to
take the introductory physics courses
here before he could start the rest of
his education, even though his cred-
its for higher physics courses would
transfer. Where is the logic in this?

The final flaw in this system is the
lack of communication between trans-
fer students and advisors. Transfer
students fill out tons of paperwork,
have their coursework scrutinized
and are then put through a subjective
system that determines which credits
will transfer and which won't. Not all
advisors can say for certain what the
department will accept. This means
that prospective students might be
told by an advisor that a lot of their
classes will count here, but then have
their hard work rejected by someone
else who hasn't even talked to them.
It is admirable of the University
to try to help out students who wish
to transfer back in state. Hopefully
accepting more students back into the
University will help keep jobs in the
state and help to repair our dismal
economy. But if the University really
wants to make this work, it needs to
help those students who do make the
final decision to transfer here. They
need to be able to count more credits,
look at each student individually and
be more logical in the admissions pro-
cess without bogging students down
with paperwork. It's not enough just
to tell students they can transfer here
- the University can and should do
more to make this process less painful
for all prospective transfer students.

How Mother Nature could stifle Wolverines

n the early-morning hours of
Jan. 11, Mike Jones was talk-
ing on the phone in his dorm
room when the fire alarm went off.
Jones, an early enrollee on the
Michigan football team, figured
someone was playing a prank. So he
grabbed a light jacket and headed
outside. He quickly realized he'd
walked into the
annual West
Quad-South
Quad snowball
fight.
Jones, a
Florida native,
didn't throw
any snowballs
because he DAN
didn't have FELDMAN
gloves. So he
just stood off
the side and watched.
Asked which dorm won, Jones
said he had no idea. He was too
cold to concentrate on what was
going on around him.
So how will he, or any of the
other 11 signees from warm-
weather states, handle November
football games - or just living - in
the Midwest?
In his first full offseason, Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez has sig-
nificantly altered the Wolverines'
recruiting strategy after replacing

Lloyd Carr, emphasizing the South
as a recruiting pipeline.
Seventeen of Rodriguez's 29
recruits have come from warm-
'weather states, compared to 33 of
Carr's 136 recruits from 2002 to
2008.
This new strategy of marching
through the South carries signifi-
cant risk, but Rodriguez has done
an impressive job of minimizing it.
Risk: Wasting time on pros-
pects who wouldn't want to come
and missing out on local recruits
who would be more receptive to a
Michigan offer, therefore ending
up with a lower-quality class.
Response: The Wolverines had
a more-impressive class from the
state of Florida than any out-of-
state program. And Michigan is
seventh in rivals.com's recruiting
rankings - eight spots ahead of
Michigan State, which focused
mostly on in-state recruiting.
The Wolverines already have a
commitment from Ricardo Miller,
one of Florida's top-ranked players
in the class of 2010. And Michigan
is high on the list of several other
Floridians in the class.
Secondary coach Tony Gibson
said opposing coaches use the
cold, snowy Ann Arbor weather in
hopes of persuading recruits not
to travel north. But Gibson said a

lot of negative recruiting can be
a positive when recruitsvisit and
see the weather isn't as bad as they
imagined.
And many of the players, some
of whom had never seen snow
before, actually see the weather as
a positive for Michigan.
Denard Robinson and Adrian
Witty, two of the eight Florida
natives to sign with the Wolverines
Wednesday, made snow angels
and had a snowball fight in the Big
House with Rodriguez on their
official visit.
Rodriguez even told the story
of a recruit who tried to take some
snow in a Ziploc bag, just to be dis-
appointed when it melted on the
plane home.
Risk: Players used to playing in
warm weather will tank in Novem-
ber.
Response: Five players from
warm-weather states are already
on campus due to early enrollment.
This is, by far, the biggest worry
with Rodriguez's recruiting strat-
egy.
Enrolling early will help play-
ers get accustomed to the cold. A
freshman last year, slot receiver
Martavious Odoms struggled
mightily against Northwestern -
the Wolverines' first game of the
season in the bitter cold.

Michigan football coach Rich Rodriguez has made a point of opening a recruiting pipeline in the talent-rich state of Florida.

Most of the early enrollees from
warm-weather states acknowl-
edged their play would be affected
by the cold if they had to play a
game today. Still, they were confi-
dent they would be well-adjustedby
the weather changes next season.
But I'm not so sure. Wide receiv-
er Greg Mathews, an Orlando, Fla.,
native, shivered uncontrollably
after last year's spring game. To be
fair, that was a very cold day - but
that was his third year at Michi-

gan.
On the flip side, players should
have more productive offseasons.
Quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said summer workouts were
"so hot and humid, you couldn't
breathe," when he worked at South
Florida.
But wins over Ohio State, not
summer workouts, will obviously
be how this class and Rodriguez's
recruiting strategy will be judged.
Games against the Buckeyes

are in the bitter cold of November.
Rodriguez is taking a calculated
risk that his southern imports can
heat up the rivalry - and that The
Game doesn't freeze them out.
He has done all he can to
increase his chances, but his
team's fate may have more to do
with Mother Nature than his
coaching.

Lucas-Perry and
others work on
shots with Beilein
By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
In the locker room following the
Michigan men's basketball tean's
66-51 loss to Illinois on Jan. 14, each
player echoed a similar sentiment.
"We just didn't make our shots
tonight."
It seems like the Wolverines have
been saying that a lot lately.
So on Tuesday morning, the
Michigan players had individual
workouts to focus on their shot.
"We're just trying to get our
stroke back," fifth-year senior guard
David Merritt said.
Since the Illinois game, Michigan
has lost five of six games and made
just 39.1 percent of its shots.

said. "If you can win at Michigan
State, you can beat Duke at Duke."
Tonight's game begins a tough
three-game stretch that includes at
No. 1 Connecticut on Saturday and
Michigan State on Tuesday.
And with Michigan sitting
squarely on the NCAA Tournament
bubble, the players know they can't
afford to lose all three of these criti-
cal games.
"These next three games can
make or break our season," Mer-
ritt said. "The sense of urgency is
definitely there ... Penn State is a
really good team, and this league is
so tough this year that if we can get
this one at home, that will set us up
nicely against Connecticut."
As for tonight, Beilein simply
hopes his team can pick up a win
one shot at a time.
"It's important - to have some
bounce in your step," Beilein said.
"The way you get a bounce in your
step is by getting wins."

'M' penalty-kill unit
strong after slow start

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
Oct. 25 was the lowest of lows
for the Michigan hockey team's
penalty kill.
On that day, the unit got demol-
ished in its first real test of the
season, surrendering five power-
play goals in an embarrassing 7-2
loss at then-No. 7 Boston Univer-
sity.
"We weren't involved in our
system, we weren't working with
each other and you need four
guys to be in concert out there,"
Michigan assistant coach Billy

Powers said yesterday, reflecting
on the game.
"They got to be pulling and
working together because if one
guy breaks down, it affects the
other three as far as what we're
trying to do in our rotation."
What made it even worse was
that Boston and Michigan run
a very similar power play. But
with a man down, the Wolverines
played passively and fell furthier

New student group to aid

ACTING IN THE ATRIUM
'W dP
S

In the spring, Global
Business Brigades
will work in Panama
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
While most students will be
enjoyingtheirfreedomfromschool
in May, a few University students
will be traveling to Central Ameri-
ca to participate in volunteer work
aimed at curbing global poverty.
The University chapter of Glob-
al Business Brigades will give stu-
dents the opportunity to travel and
work with communities in Central
America. The group will work
with the communities in a variety
of ways: from helping them start
businesses to working with them
to better manage crops. Collin
Petersonpresidentand co-founder
of the University's chapter of GBB,
said the group provides an "easy
gateway" to volunteering while
,lso teaching basic skills needed to
help communities in need.
"Our goals are based upon the
resolution of poverty," he said.
"That is an extraordinary goal that
cannot be accomplished by solely
our group, but each step that we

take is one step closer."
Peterson said he hopes to make
the trip to Central America a regu-
lar excursion, beginning with this
year's trip to Panama.
Matt Boesler, executive director
of the University's chapter of GBB,
said he hopes the trip will help
alleviate poverty in Panama.
"By helping to expand small
businesses, we will build com-
munity wealth and encourage the
spirit of entrepreneurship in a way
that I believe will help to break the
cycle of poverty that many Pana-
manians face," he said.
Boesler added that he thinks
the group's trip to Panama will not
only benefit the country but also
the group's participants.
"Our trip will be one week early
in the summer, during which we
hope to provide consulting, micro-
finance and educational services
to developing microenterprises -
businesses that could range from
two people weaving hammocks to
a community-wide farmingco-op,"
he said.
Boesler said that the partici-
pants' skills include accounting,
business management and agricul-
ture. He said this broad variety of
abilities will allow the organiza-
tion to help the communities in as

many ways as possible.
Peterson said the trips are
largely dependent on the nation-
al program of the club and will
require the University's chapter to
fundraise and hold special events
in order to send members on the
trips.
"Throughout the entire process
we will be planning our trips with
help from our national nonprofit
organization, Global Business Bri-
gades," he said. "From this organi-
zation we are given projects, many
of which are from the Peace Corps."
The idea to start a University
chapter of the group came natu-
rally to Peterson, who said he has
a passion for helping the global
community.
"With such diversity and mas-
sive amounts of resources here at
the University, we have come to
realize the effects we can have on
the world," he said. "After doing
some research, we stumbled across
this organization, who shares many
of the aspirations that we hold."
Before it heads to Panama, the
group is focusing on recruiting as
many new members as possible
by blitzing campus with fliers and
mass meetings.
"We want to get our name out
there," Peterson said.

SERVICE
From Page1A
Last year had already been a
record-breaking year for the orga-
nization, as it received over 25,000
applications from over 90 colleges.
Lorraine Anderson, recruitment
communications director for Teach
for America, said in an e-mail inter-
view that 2009 is already well sur-
passing those numbers.
She said the increase in student
interest can be linked to Obama's
call to join national service pro-
grams.
"We see multiple causes for this
increase in applicants thus far,"
Anderson said. "Including the
excitement around the recent elec-

tion, and the growing enthusiasm
among young people to enter pub-
lic service and make a measurable,
positive impact on society."
The Peace Corps has also report-
ed an overwhelming increase in
applications. Since last year, there
has already been a 16 percent
increase in applications, the largest
in the past five years.
Christine Torres, a public affairs
specialist at the Chicago Regional
Peace Corps office, said that from
Jan. 20-21, 2008 to the same dates
in 2009, there was a 63-percent
increase in applications nation-
wide.
And accordingto the Peace Corps
Top Colleges and Universities list,
the University of Michigan has
played its part, ranking in the top

five for each of the last four years.
But despite the recent spike in
interest, these organizations say
they are not planning to expand
proportionally to the increase of
applicants, and will subsequently
be forced to turn down more people
than ever.
Political Science Prof. Hanes
Walton Jr. said in an e-mail inter-
view that he expects students will
continue to respond positively to
Obama's call to service.
"The call to service held when
John Kennedy set up the Peace
Corps and when President Clinton
created the national service call,"
he said.
He added that history will likely
show it to be successful for Presi-
dent Obama as well.
meet before Washtenaw County
Circuit Court Judge David Swartz
to determine the status of the case.
Shea said he does not believe a
plea bargain will be offered and
that the case will go to trial.
"Itseemsto me that each side has
a point of view that is pretty incon-
sistent with the other," he said. "And
that typically breeds trials."

would notice changes in funding.
Specifically, Weiss said the
School of Education, College of
Engineering, College of Literature,
Science and Arts, School of Natural
Resources and Environment and
the Taubman College of Architec-
ture and Urban Planning would
experience noticeable changes in
funding.
During the presentation, SACUA
member Gina Poe, an associate pro-
fessor of anesthesiology, expressed
concern over how the proposal
would affect students who need to
take a semester or more away for
classes from personal reasons.
SIGNING DAY
From Page 1A
freshman) Tate (Forcier), who took
command every game he played
in. That's the thing that excites us
about Tate and Denard. Those are
guys who, when you watch their
game film, they kind of took charge
and controlled things."
Much of the day's attention cen-
tered on the quarterback position,
where Michigan signed two qual-
ity dual-threat options, Forcier and
Robinson. Rodriguez said that both
quarterbacks are in the running
to compete with redshirt sopho-
more Steven Threet and redshirt
junior Nick Sheridan for the start-
ing spot. Rodriguez needed to pick
up signal-callers that fit his fast-
paced offense - and he apparently
did that in Forcier (rated by Rivals.
com as the most accurate passer in
the nation) and Robinson, who gar-
nered additional recruitment atten-
tion from Rodriguez when former
quarterback commit Shavodrick
Beaver backed out.
"We got two of the best ones we
could possibly ask for," Michigan
quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said. "You know, we had one bow
out at the end there and we weren't
too happy about that, but we moved
on and probably got a better one in
Denard."

"I think that anyone whois chal-
lenged, who is demanded by their
community, for whatever reason,
and needstostop - and I know a lot
of people like this - would not be
able to come back under this Rack-
ham policy," she said.
No formal policy currently exists
for personal leaves of absence. If
the continuous enrollment require-
ment is implemented, students
would be allowed to take "a one-
term personal leave of absence for
any reason one time during their
Ph.D. studies," according to Rack-
ham's website.
The Rackham Executive Board
approved the policy in December,
but the policy will not be imple-
mented until at least the fall semes-
ter of 2010.
Forcier, who's already on cam-
pus, appears to have the upper hand
on Robinson because he will par-
ticipate in the 15 spring practices in
March, and has an extra semester
to adjust to college before summer
workouts start in the spring.
But while everyone else was
preoccupied with the competition
between the two young, quarter-
backs, the easygoing Forcier wasn't
too worried about it.
"I just -know (Robinson's) last
name - I don't know anything
about him," Forcier said. "My mom
was the one that actually said, 'Oh,
you've got competition coming.' Oh,
you know, I don't care."
Forcier threw for 3,424 yards and
ran for another 783, with 35 touch-
downs his senior year. Robinson
compiled 1,809 passing yards, 462
rushing yards and 23 touchdowns.
Though he compiled an impres-
sive class, Rodriguez did voice
some concerns with recruiting as a
whole. After last year's 3-9 record,
he said the Michigan coaches ran
into "more negative recruitingthan
there's ever been," a discouraging
reality for the coach.
"I don't think you have-to do that
to get a guy," Rodriguez said. "I tell
our coaches, 'you talk about the
good things we have to offer. ... If
you have to negative recruit to get
him, then we're probably recruiting
the wrong guy."

HOW TO GIVE YOUR
W WEEK A HAPPY ENDING


There's a difference between communicating ideas and experiencing them. It's the
difference between memorizing a foreign language and thinking in one. Between
studying ruins and excavating them. Between analyzing dreams and living them. The
difference is huge. And it's the very essence of the University of Chicago Summer
Session. Where students are engaged at every level-intellectually, socially, personally,
and professionally. Where you can benefit from the value of taking university courses
in an accelerated, intensive format. Join us this summer for an extraordinary learning
experience at the academic home to 82 Nobel laureates and the new U.S. President.
FOR STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND BEYOND.

weekend
essentials
Feb. 5 to Feb. 8
MUSIC
Noble Beast, Andrew
Bird's latest effort, is an
absolute essential for
surviving the cabin fever
that unfailingly consumes
Michigan winters. Bird
gets so far inside his own
head on this album that
he'll drag listeners out of
their own. It's enough to
distract even the most
stressed of students. So
bring out the Bose, turn
on the Bird and forget
that it's February; the
friendly combination of
violin, guitar and whimsi-
cal vocals is a perfect
blanket for the cold.
CONCERT
There are only a few
chances to experience
a new artist when that
person is commonplace
- pretty soon, you're
just another fan from
the multitude. Tenor
Laurence Brownlee's
visit this weekend is one
of those rare chances.
He has been called "the
most impressive addition
to the American tenor
roster in many years"
by the San Francisco
Chronicle, and his con-
cert at Hill this Saturday
should be appropriately
memorable. 8 p.m. Tick-
ets starting at $10.

the can't-miss films of last year. So without further ado, who wants to see a magic trick?

1. "THE DARK KNIGHT"
Hindsight's a valuable thing, and there's a reason we all saw this 11 times. So
much has been said about Christopher Nolan's revisionist spectacle, but in short,
"The Dark Knight" is perfect. Perfect in its mix of art and entertainment; perfect
in its mass appeal and longevity. An operatic costume tragedy, it's a money-mak-
er with guts and brains. It was easily the greatest film experience of 2008. Forget
the Oscars. In time, this film will receive the honors it really deserves.
BLAKE GOBLE

To quote Harvey Milk himself, "You gotta give 'em hope" - and this film cer-
tainly takes that to heart. An absorbing look into the life of openly gay politician
Harvey Milk, "Milk" is the perfect mix of humor, inspiration and strength. In
the center of it all is the wonderfully human performance by Sean Penn. Years
from now, audiences will still feel this film's poignant message of tolerance and,
yes, hope.
SHERI JANKELOVITZ

ONLINE
Those with access to a
television or computer
know that Christian Bale
recently went apeshit -
yet again - on the set of
"Terminator Salvation."
What's different this time
around, though, is that
his rampage has been
made into ... a song. It's
called "Bale Out" and
is composed by L.A.
mixologist RevoLucian.
Sure, it won't win any
Grammys, but it's well
worth two minutes and
48 seconds of your time.
Available on MySpace.

5. "THE CURIOUS CASE
OF BENJAMIN BUTTON"

Telling the story of a young man from the slums and his quest to win
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire," "Slumdog Millionaire" is sometimes a
human drama, other times a romance and at all times completely magical. It
beautifully details pain, suffering and, above all, the strength of the human
spirit. A film that will leave you wanting to dance out of the theater, "Slum-
dog" is without a doubt one of the best films of the year. And that's the final
answer.
SHERI JANKELOVITZ

It speaks to the quality of the film when its 166-minute running time seems to
just fly by. "Benjamin Button" combines stunning CGI effects, solid acting and
an intriguing fantasy storyato create one ofthis year's best-produced films. While
it's Pitt's film to carry, a strong supporting cast, including Taraji P. Henson as
Button's adoptive mother, keeps the audience engaged and the film enchanting.
ANNIE LEVENE

3. "WALL-E"

The term "movie magic" has been abducted by Disney (a subsidiary of Buy n
Large) as a corporate catchphrase. So it's playing into the palm of their Mickey
Mouse hand to declare this Pixar's sci-fi robot romance as such. Yet what other
possible response could one have to seeing the world's most adorable trash com-
pactor escape a demolished Earth, sail into the outer reaches of the galaxy on
the back of a spaceship that holds his true love and outstretch his arm to brush
Saturn's rings? Very well: Magical it is.
ANDREW LAPIN

6. "GRAN TORINO"
Like "The Searchers" for 2008, Clint Eastwood handed in his most aware
and oddly affable performance with this contemporary "mid-western." Seldom
has an old curmudgeon been this likeable. A morality tale about traditional
values fighting with progressive redemption, Eastwood puts everything he
has learned over the course of his career into this film. It may be his last per-
formance, and if that's true, he has made his departure even harder with this
movie. A crowd-pleaser with a message, as long as you stay off his lawn.
BLAKE GOBLE

MOVIES
Guy Ritchie's "RockN-
Rolla" came and went
in theaters last fall with
barely a blip on the radar.
Now that it's on DVD,
fans of high-octane heist
flicks can finally see what
they've been missing. The
coolness of the cast is off
the charts: Gerard Butler
as a thug named One
Two, Thandie Newton
as the smokin' hot babe
Stella and Tom Wilkenson
as a snarling, scenery-
chewing crime overlord.
If you liked "Snatch,"
then snatch this one up.

High five
A notable Ann Arborite gives five
answers to a curious question.
Jonathang Ewelnt
What are the five best alien-themed
works, in five different genres?
FILM: "The Abyss" (leap). An extraterrestrial movie that just happens to
take plate at the bottom of the ocean. It's one part "2001" and one part "glue
Planet." Setting the movie on Earth helps develop an environmental theme,
which isn'ttypical for alien films. There's some heavy-handed moraizing at the
end, but it doesn't detratt. Just remember: psychos with nuclear weeapons, bad;
water tentacles, awesome.
NONFICTION: "Interpretations of Dreams" by Sigmund Freud (58991). An
alien intelligence lives inside you and tries to communicate by sending you cryp-
tic messages in your dreams. What could possibly make that more interesting?
How about it just might be true?
MUSIC: David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders
from Mare (1972). A concept album about a philanthropic alien glamn-rocker who
comes to Earth to save the world only to get distracted by sex and drugs. To
think this album emerged only eight years after the Beatles' first appearance on
Ed Sullivan is really mind-blowing.
TV: "Star Trek: Voyager" (Season 4, 1997). I've been a "Star Trek" fan for
years, sotI couldn't in good conscience keep the entire franchise off the hast. But
it was difficult to choose just one part. I always liked the premise of "Voyager,"
but I never thought the series lived up to its promise until the fourth season.
There, Janeway's choice to ally herself with one enemy (the Borg) to defeat
another (Species 8472) really captures the difficulty of political double binds.
FICTION: "Tlfin, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" by Jorge Lois Borges. In this short
story, another (alien) world not only intrudes on this one but begins completely
to take over. It's a post-modern fable about conspiracies, secret societies and a
total, miraculous transformation of reality - but it's also a story that helped get
me hooked on literature.

The art of
home brewing

nn Arbor is home to a
large foodie popula-
tion, so it shouldn't
be a surprise that students
are brewing
their own
beer. These
students
share a sub-
tle passion
for the art of
brewery as '
well as for its KARA
final prod- MORRIS
uct. Just ask
around - you've probably met
a closet brewer.
} The beauty of home brew-
ing is that you can adjust the
ingredients - and alcohol
content - to your tastes. Even
on a bad day, your home brew
will likely be better and less
expensive than anything you'd
find at Campus Corner. The
delicate process, which often
involves a simmering concoc-
tion of obscure ingredients and
a couple good friends, is just a
cauldron away from Macbeth's
witches' brew.
A second pleasure of home
brewing is developing a keen
understanding and appre-
ciation of where your drink
actually comes from. This
was immediately apparent
when I met LSA junior James
Graessle. While his roommate
prepared a loaf of honey wheat
bread, James explained how he
put cherry concentrate in his
latest concoction.
Commenting on his previ-
ous batch, he mentions, "I like
it, it's good beer ... to go out
and buy nice beer, it's a lot of
money." He calculates that this
batch, which yielded about two
cases of "good beer," only cost
about $30.
James brews with two of his
roommates and mentions that
they taught themselves to brew
using online resources. He uses
malt extract, which is quicker
than traditional all-grain
"mash" brewing. In this process,
the final brew must sit in the
dark for a week before adding
sugar, bottling it and waiting
about two to six more weeks.
For those interested in
brewing, he has three key rec-
ommendations: regulate the
temperature closely, sterilize
carefully and avoid exposure
to light during fermenta-
tion. James recommends Ann
Arbor's Beer Depot and men-
tions that brewers will need a
kitchen and some room - or
at least a closet - to brew and
ferment beer.
Home brewing is also an
excellent means of develop-
ing your palate. Fodie Oren
Brandvain, LSA junior, also
brews with his roommates. He
enjoys it because of the beer's
quality and comments that
he has developed a taste for
better brews as a result. Oren
brews by the "all-grain" brew-
ing process, which combines
steeped grains, "the mash,"
hops and yeast after cooling.
The mixture is fermented for
two weeks in a carboy before
adding sugar and bottling for
seven to 10 more days.
Oren's advises any aspiring
brewer who wants to refine
his or her palate to keep a very
detailed journal and record

minutiae like temperature
readings throughout the
process. That way they can
account for different tastes
between batches. He also
stressed the importance of san-
itation: "If it's not completely
sanitized, it might taste sour."
If the timing and strict tem-
perature regulation involved in
beer brewing are too daunting,
there are a few other options
for those interested in knocking
back a homemade brew. In addi-
tion to brewing beer, Juan Leon,
Music, Theatre & Dance junior,
makes his own hard cider.
Juan's enthusiasm for brew-
ing was immediately apparent
when he gave me a tour of his
brewing stations. Beside fer-
menting cider, Juan also makes
ginger beer; both were capped
with a carboy bung. A third
kind of brew, strawberry wheat
lager, rested in the cool, dark
basement.
Unlike beer, cider doesn't
need to be heated during
brewing. After prepping, Juan
introduces his own yeast from
U-Brew in Ypsilanti, which
he recommends because the
staffers are very helpful and
knowledgeable about the beer-
brewing process. He has tried
both champagng and ale yeast,

and he recommends cham-
pagne yeast for hard cider.
Juan stores the cider in a cov-
ered carboy at room tempera-
ture for two to three weeks
before bottling.
With three diversified drinks
in the making, Juan demon-
strates his commitment to
curiosity and the art of brewery.
For those who are interested
in brewing beer or hard cider,
Juan recommends that students
buy a kit to get started on a
project of their own.
"Really," he said, "it's all
about experimenting.
Few can match the excite-
ment of first-year Rackham
student Tim Friese as he
explains his mead-brewing
process. Mead, as Tim
explains, is a 20-40 proof
honey wine. He started brew-
ing the drink several years
ago because the only mead
he could find was watery and
expensive.
Brewing mead requires a
few more ingredients than
cider, but it uses a very simi-
lar process. Tim uses Bryan
Acton and Peter Duncan's
book "Making Mead" as a
guide. He pours gently heated
honey and water into a 6.5 gal-
lon carboy before adding the
remaining ingredients, which
include citric acid, tannins and
champagne yeast. In a slightly
arduous process, Tim shakes
the large bottle before filling it
to the top with water and let-
ting it ferment for two to three
months.
Revealing his love for the
art of brewery, Tim described
how he experiments by adding
fruit like lemons or peach con-
centrate. The addition of the
peach juice was his most recent
success. He has also tried add-
ing different types of honey,
like clever and wildflower
varieties. Tim does not, how-
ever, recommend eucalyptus
Crafting the
ideal draught.
tree honey, saying that his last
eucalyptus brew "smelled like
dirty socks - but actually had
the most character."
Tim zealously encourages
anyone who's interested in
brewing to at least try it. He
stresses the importance of
documenting the process and
labeling the carboys so it's easi-
er to see how different ingredi-
ents affect the final brew.
Apart from a love of brewing
and the brew itself, the most
common theme I found during
my home-brewed inquisitions
was the sharing of the spoils.
So, if you've been craving a
good brew at a pauper's price,
grab a few good friends and
take a trip to The Beer Depot.

Honoring progressive writing

For 78 years, the Hopwood
Awards have been cultivating
literary culture in Ann Arbor
By PRIYA BALI
Daily Arts Writer
By Tuesday at noon, piles of writing submis-
sions will have formed in 1176 Angell Hall, better
known as the Hopwood Room. For the 78th year
in a row, selected works of poetry, fiction, nonfic-
tion and screenplays will be awarded all in the
name of Avery and Jule Hopwood.
The Hopwood Awards is widely considered
among the largest and most prestigious writing
contests in the country. Avery Hopwood, a play-
wright and University alum from 1905, wrote in
his will that the University should use one fifth of
his estate toward a writing contest that held the
Hopwood name.
Although he became one of the most popular
playwrights on Broadway in the early 20th centu-
ry, he was troubled by the possibilitythat his writ-
ing would never be remembered as extraordinary.
He decided to leave his unfulfilled dreams up to
future writers instead, calling the competition
a challenge that should exemplify "the new, the
unusual and the radical." Since 1931, Hopwood's
goal of encouraging creative expression in young
writers has been vividly active at the University.
"To the degree that Ann Arbor is a town cel-
ebrated for its authors, this is part of that. The
bookstore culture, reading culture and the writ-
ing community - all are importantly sustained
by +h holen erievnce of t henwoosm ai d

Prof. Nicholas Delbanco, director of the Hopwood
Program for over 20 years.
"We're inhabiting a very old space and honor-
ing a long-established tradition," he said.
In addition to the Undergraduate and Graduate
Hopwood Awards, the Hopwood Program admin-
isters 13 other writing contests, including the
Arthur Miller Award and the Kasdan Scholarship
in Creative Writing, which were named after two
renowned recipients. Other well-known winners
include Robert Hayden, Frank O'Hara and Uni-
versity Creative Writing Prof. Laura Kasischke.
Submissions have continued to grow since the
program's inception in 193L And although only a
few of these submissions are eventually bestowed
with awards, the program has certainly accom-
plished what Hopwood wished it: encouraging
student writing.
After submissions have been read by a pre-
liminary set of judges, chosen works are sent to
national judges who are not associated with the
University. All submissions are sent in anony-
mously, making the contest as close to objective
as possible.
"Any artistic contest is so much shaped by
elements that are outside the work itself, includ-
ing the subjectivity of the reader and simply the
quality of perception of the reader," said Keith
Taylor, a creative writing lecturer in the Depart-
ment of English and former judge of the Hopwood
Awards. "Quality does find a way to get to the top
sooner or later but you can't be absolutely sure of
the process."
Writing in and of itself can be immensely dif-
ficult, but crafting one's work for a contest can
feel even more daunting. Still, there's something
more to be said of winninga contest like the Hop-
woods.
"I always thought
they were very vindicat-
ing - winning an award
makes all those nights
alone in your room with
paper and a pen worth
it," said Beenish Ahmed,
RC Creative Writing
senior and winner ofsev-
eral Hopwood Awards.
"The most remarkable
thing about the writing
scene in Ann Arbor is
that there is one."
"A writer will never
be homeless here," she
said.
One doesn't need to
look far to realize that
encouragement of stu-

dent writing goes beyond the monetary value of
these awards. A campus saturated by interest in
the arts, the University - and, moreover, Ann
Arbor - is made up of a supportive community
that understands the extent to which writing
reaches a larger audience.
"I think what I learned in Ann Arbor was how
to seek out a second set of eyes and ears when I
need them and how to be my own best editor,"said
Matthew Hittinger, a 2004 MFA graduate who
now lives and works in New York City. "I had an
outlet to share my work and the floodgates opened
when I got there." Hittinger was the recipient of a
Hopwood Award for Poetry and the Helen S. and
John Wagner Prize in 2004.
Student-run literary publications like Xylem,
the Oleander Review and Interrobang Literary
Magazine, along with poetry and fiction read-
ings sponsored by the Hopwood Program and the
MFA Program, are only a few examples ofhow the
power of the written word can't help but resonate
throughout this arts-hungry college town.
"Only in Ann Arbor would you have two
readings going on in the same night," Hitting-
er said. And he's right. When he gave a poetry
reading at Shaman Drum in November from
his book "Pear Slip" (winner of the 2006 Spire
Press Chapbook Award), another reading was
being given at Crazy Wisdom, a local bookstore
on Main Street.
Although poetry has remained grounded in its
own subculture, its relevance is undeniably pres-
ent inAnn Arbor. The city's abilityto both encom-
pass the nation's largest writing contest and
become the backdrop against which close-knit
groups of writers and readings flourish make such
relevance possible. This is the stuff Ann Arbor's
rare and expansive literary culture is made of.
The same can be said of the Ann Arbor Arthur
Miller once knew.
Delbanco has inserted a portion of the play-
wright's autobiography in the introduction to his
book on the Hopwood Awards: "Outside, Ann
Arbor was empty, still in the spell of spring vaca-
tion ... I ran up to the'deserted center of town,
across the Law Quadrangle and down North Uni-
versity, my head in the stars ... The magical force
of making marks on a piece of paper and reaching
into another human being, making him see what I
had seen and feel my feelings - I had made a new
shadow on the earth."
Like so many others, this is a place where
Miller's realization of his life as a writer was first
hatched and the place where his dreams were
validated. It is also, remarkably, the same place
where a similar dream was ripened for writers
like Ahmed and Hittinger, and now, for manyof
those who will submit their work Tuesday.

By DAILY TV/NEW
MEDIA STAFF
This year's Superbowl com-
mercials had a bizarre penchant
for nostalgia, animals and unwar-
ranted violence. They included at
least three ads doing the senti-
mental generation hop (perhaps
in desperate attempts to prove
their staying power in an economy
that doesn't discriminate), Bud-
weiser and Pedigree attempting
to increase the visibility of horses
in the media and Doritos, Audi
and Bud Light favoring slapstick
aggression ending in death or
testicular hindrance. Originality
wasn't exactly abundant. There
were, however, some stand-outs.
And that's where we, your friend-
ly Daily TV staff, will weigh in.
CONAN GOES A BIT TOO FAR
If you've ever wondered about
a commercial's ability to be both
terrifyingly awkward and hilari-
ously self-referential, wonder no
more. Bud Light's spot on meta-
satire has now officially and
permanently burned its brand,
along with some uncomfort-
able images, into the malleable
minds of mainstream America.
The only thing more disturbing

than Conan O'Brien crawling
around in a mesh top while hiss-
ing was when Bridgestone's
Potato Head commercial set the
feminist movement back 30 years.
RACHEL HANDLER
HULU MAKES ITS PRESENCE
FELT
Super Bowl ads tend to run
the gamut from ordinary to plain
weird, and online television
hub Hulu's one-minute spot fell
solely in the latter column. Fea-
turing Alec Baldwin as an alien
accidentally revealing Hulu's
plans for world domination, it
didn't necessarily make sense,
but if this is what the revolution
looks like, I'm already on board.
ERIC CHIU
THE QUICK LIFE
For those of us bored to tears
by those never-ending 30-second
commercials, Miller High Life
aired the first ever one-second-
long ad during this year's Super
Bowl. It featured a portly beer
deliveryman screaming "HIGH
LIFE!" Maybe Miller was just
pinched for cash and couldn't
afford the $3 million for a regu-
lar-length commercial, but who
knows? Maybe the future of

advertising will be friendlier to
our shortening attention spans.
TOMMY COLEMAN
CARS.COM, DISAPPOINT-
MENT OF THE CENTURY
There was so much potential
here. The ad seemed destined
for greatness when the newborn
congratulated the doctor with a
handshake. And the momentsthat
followed were equally brilliant.
But then, the guy's befuddled
when choosing a car? Come on, it's
a freaking car. Once Americans
everywhere were left hanging by
this underwhelming commercial,
it's hard to say who was more dis-
appointed: them or the Cardinals.

7."MAN ON WIRE"
"Man on Wire" covers the
scheming behind the red-headed
Frenchman Philippe Petit's infa-
mous walk between the Twin
Towers. It's funny, endearing and
almost poetic at times. Petit cap-
tured the spirit of the '70s and the
film brings to life the raw emotion
behind his feats.
EMILYBOUDREAU

8. "IN BRUGES"
Yes, the film is charming to the
extreme. But there's more to "In
Bruges" than inducing chortles as
Colin Farrell's supposedly tough
hitman swears and trudges his
way through a fairy tale village.
Death is an ever-present force on
this vacation, and the movie's final
act drives that point home with
striking camera work, potboiler
suspense and the mournful, heart-
ripping usage of The Dubliners'
song "On Raglan Road." As these
characters approach their har-
rowing but justified consequences,
Martin McDonagh's tragicomedy
approaches greatness.
ANDREWLAPIN
9. "IRON MAN"
One of the most energetic mov-
ies of the year, "Iron Man" closely
follows the original comic book
source material with nonstop
action and pure, unadulterated
fun. In a time of complex philo-
sophical/political distractions,
the film is a refreshing change
from the subliminal subtexts that,
characterize so many modern
superhero movies. In the end, the
success of the movie is attributed

to the basics: keen attention to the
story and eye-opening and origi-
nal visual effects.
HANS YADAV

different lights: a proud public
figure and a more flawed private
man. He humanizes Nixon in a
way that is both endearing and
entertaining.
ANNIE LEVENE
11. "TROPIC THUNDER"
Much has been said about Rob-
ert Downey Jr.'s exceptional and
divisive dip into black-face, but
"Tropic Thunder" has some acute
writing (thanks to Justin Theroux
and Ben Stiller, Downey's co-star
and director) that should not go
unappreciated. Beginning with
lewd and crude faux-previews,
"Thunder" is as politically incor-
rect as possible. It adheres to the
no-holds-barred, offend-all-so-
as-to-offend-no-one mantra, but
it succeeds where Howard Stern
and other racy comics fail. "Thun-
der" has the same wit and layering
as the similar comic classic "The
Three Amigos," and that Downey
character is pretty hilarious.
ELIE ZWIEBEL

riveting piece of drama. Writer-
director John Patrick Shanley
elicits remarkably strong perfor-
mances from Meryl Streep, Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams
and Viola Davis as'three mem-
bers of the parish faculty and the
mother of a student, respectively.
Having adapted the script from
his own stageplay, Shanley con-
structs an entirely enthralling
character piece that only gains
more strength in its execution on
screen.
NOAHDEAN STAHL
13. "BURN AFTER READING"
It's the Coen brothers at their
most bizarre yet, so of course"it's
hilarious. "Burn After Reading"
stars Brad Pitt, George Clooney
(that's enough right there) and
Frances McDormand. Pitt is a
meathead who believes he has
uncovered FBI secrets, McDor-
mand isa physical trainer who just
wants some plastic surgery and
Clooney keeps a sex machine in
his basement. Through a series of
unusual coincidences, their lives
become entangled in one of the
biggest government misunder-
standings imaginable.
EMILYBOUDREAU

14. "BEYOND OUR KEN"
If you stumble upon this cult
documentary, you'll find yourself
quoting it for a lifetime: But that
shouldn't be the only reason to
see this superb observation of the
Australian cult Kenja, named for
founders Ken Dyers and Jan Ham-
ilton. Half-shocking, half-hilari-
ous, you'll want to transfer energy,
put on aplay and grapple your niece
right after. Seriously, that's all in
there. It's highly obscure, but total-
ly worthwhile. In a good year for
dots, this was the most unique.
BLAKE GOBLE
15. "THE WRESTLER"
If a man is defined by what he
does, whatbecomes ofhimwhenhe
isnolongerneeded?"The Wrestler"
is a beautiful movie that chronicles
the aftermath of a noteworthy pro-
fessional careerand afailedperson-
al life. Mickey Rourke is brilliant as
Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. This is
Rourke's most important andmem-
orable performance to date, and
while the movie is extraordinarily
directed. by Darren Aronofsky, the
spotlight remains firmly fixed on
Mickey Rourke.

10. "FROST/NIXON"
Based on Peter Morgan's stage
play, "Frost/Nixon" is heavy on
talk but never boring. It's a film
that allows younger audiences to
see further into Richard Nixon's
famous Watergate scandal, an
event that ordinarily seems only
flat and historical. Frank Langel-
la, as disgraced President Nixon,
is particularly impressive as he
oortravs his character in two
