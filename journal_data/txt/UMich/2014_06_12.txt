The University's Michigan Sur-

from the Health Care Innovation
Award to fund the implementation
of theirstructured, pre-surgery
program.
MSHOP seeks to improve sur-

decision to have surgery and the
scheduled surgery date. Patients in
the program are encouraged to be
active, quit smoking, eat properly
and practice relaxation techniques
designed to boost optimism.
Dr. Michael J. Englesbe, associ-

Study examines concerns over 'fracking' in Mich.

Residents express
concerns despite low
rates of utilization
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
As debates occur nationwide
over the continued use of hydrau-
lit fracturing - colloquially
known as fracking - to extract oil
and natural gas from shale depos-
its deep beneath the surface of the
earth, University researchers have
released a report examining public
perceptions of this controversial
practice in Michigan.
The Center for Local, State and
Urban Policy published the report
last week, compiled with data
from the center's biannual Michi-
gan Public Policy Survey of local
governments. About 1,350 juris-
dictions responded to the survey,
which also gauged perceptions on
issues pertaining to wind energy,
bankruptcy and the Great Lakes.
CLOSUP program manager
Thomas Ivacko said the survey's
goal was to shed light on public
opinion, especially given that the
issue will likely only intensify
moving forward as it has in other
states.
"The objectivewastoget a sense
of how fracking is playing out as an

issue in Michigan communities,"
Ivacko said. "Even though it's not
happening much, it is a topic of
conversation in quite a few plac-
es."
The survey revealed surpris-
ing results in several areas. For
example, it demonstrated that
fracking is still a rare occurrence
in Michigan despite the media
attention it has received. Only 6
percent of jurisdictions reported
that the practice was occurring
in their area.
The study also showed public
perception of fracking may not
be very clearly defined. While
only 11 percent of officials said
the majority of their jurisdiction
would support fracking, almost
one-third of those same officials
said they support fracking them-
selves.
In addition, the data also point-
ed to some regional disparities on
the issue, with greater support
for fracking in northern regions
of the Lower Peninsula where the
practice is more commonly imple-
mented.
Ivacko noted that fracking is tiot
a new occurrence. In fact, accord-
ing to the Michigan Department
of Environmental Quality, oil and
gas companies have been using the
technique - pumping water, sand
and chemicals into wells to allow
for the release of natural gas and

oil - since 1952.
Recently, however, some com-
panies have utilized an updated
method, known as high-volume
hydraulic fracturing, to service
larger areas and extract greater
quantities of oil and gas. These
wells descend up to 5,000 feet
below the ground and extend hori-
zontally once they reach an ideal
depth.
Ivacko said the new technique
is controversial, in part, because
it uses more water and chemicals.
Whereas vertical wells may use up
to 100,000 gallons of water, some
horizontal wells can require as
much as 20 million gallons.
However, the Michigan DEQ
has said that current practices do
not present a safety risk to humans
and are not placing a strain on
resources.
Among the factors encourag-
ing fracking, survey respondents
listed - in order - "revenue for
land-owners," "local property
tax revenue" and "potential envi-
ronmental benefits from cleaner-
burning gas instead of coal" as the
top three.
The top three factors discour-
aging factors were "potential risks
to water resources", "potential
environmental damage linked to
fracking operations, such as spills,
leaks, etc." and "potential risks to
citizens' health".

The study found the opinions
varied between jurisdictions, but
that most, regardless of how they
viewed fracking, wanted greater
control over regulating the prac-
tice.
Among local officials, 63 per-
cent felt that local governments
should have a great deal of author-
ity in regulating fracking in their
jurisdiction, whereas only 16 and
45 percent felt federal and state
governments should have a great
deal of authority, respectively.
Current law places the majority of
regulatory power in the hands of
the state government, as opposed
to local ones.
"Local governments in Michi-
gan really are pretty severely
restricted in what they can do
about fracking," Ivacko said. "Cer-
tainly for townships and for coun-
ties, it's going to be a great uphill
battle for them to stop any kind of
fracking in their jurisdiction."
While cities, townships and
counties do all have varying
degrees of control over frack-
ing operations, Ivacko said they
remain limited.
"At the moment, for the most
part, local governments are going
to lose out," he said. "Clearly this
is a state-level policy topic and the
state has reserved the authority to
regulate it for themselves."

Porikos commits

cOURTESY OF MICHIGAN RUGBY
The Michigan club rugby team won the Big Ten title and reached the national quarterfinals before losing to Kutztown.
Rugby routs OSU, reaches
national quarterfinals

Ann Arbor
native adds size,
experience to small
2015 class
By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan hockey team's
defense just got a much-needed
lift.
Niko Porikos, a former defen-
seman for the Hamilton Red
Wings of the Ontario Junior
Hockey League, has commit-
ted to Michigan, per his Twitter
account. The program has yet to
announce the late addition to its
2014-15 roster.
Porikos, an Ann Arbor native,
tallied 21 points including nine
goals and 12 assists in 51 games
with the Red Wings.
"Couldn't be more excited to
announce Iwill be playing hock-
ey for the University of Michi-
gan. #GoBlue," Porikos tweeted
Monday.
A 21-year-old freshman, Por-
ikos adds experience to a five-
man freshman class that now
includes two defensemen, two
forwards and a goaltender. At
6-foot-3, 185 pounds, the left-

hander will also provide neces-
sary size.
Incoming freshman forward
Dylan Larkin, a projected first-
round NHL Draft pick, will also
provide a boost to a defense that
struggled mightily in Michigan's
second straight season without
an NCAA Tournament appear-
ance.
Porikos and incoming fresh-
man defenseman Cutler Martin
are expected to fill voids left by
Mac Bennett and Kevin Clare,
who combined for 24 points last
season.
Like last season, the Wolver-
ines' defense is young. Despite
Michigan's large freshman class,
only rising sophomore Michael
Downing played a key role on
the top-line pairing next to Ben-
nett. Defenseman Kevin Lohan
missed a majority of the regu-
lar season with an ACL injury
while Nolan De Jong added just
five points in 29 games. And
it remains to be seen whether
forward-turned-defenseman
Andrew Sinelli will return to the
unit or switch back to offense for
his senior campaign.
Either way, expect Porikos
and Michigan's underclassmen
to play key roles in Michigan
coach Red Berenson's defensive-
minded system.

'M' finishes 3-1 at
tournament after
Big Ten title
By MITCH BECKMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan rugby team rare-
ly gets spotlight. However, when
given the opportunity, it took full
advantage of it.
Playing on NBC last weekend,
the Wolverines routed Ohio State,
21-5, at the National Collegiate
Rugby Championship.
The victory over Ohio State fol-
lowed wins over Texas and Navy to
complete a 3-0 record in pool play.
Despite the impressive perfor-
mance, Michigan fell to eventual
runner-up Kutztown in the quar-
terfinals,14-0. Kutztown eventual-
ly lost to California in the national
championship game.
Despite the defeat, Michigan
coach Matt Trenary saw the season
as a big step forward for his pro-
gram. Michigan captured the Big
Ten title before taking part in its
first national tournament.
"It was a tremendous tourna-
ment for us," Trenary said. "The
win over Navy was a high-quality
win. We've never had a win like
that. I think we surpassed every-
one else's expectations. And in
the rugby world people are taking

notice. I'm already getting contacts
from high-school (kids) that are
interested in our program."
While the win over Navy may
have been the upset of the week-
end for the Wolverines, a dominant
performance over the Buckeyes
may have been their most impres-
sive match.
The win over Ohio State was
anchored by stout defense and a
balanced offensive attack. Fifth-
year senior Christian Mentzer and
juniors Sequoyah Burke-Combs
and Cole Van Horn each scored
tries for the Wolverines.
Michigan notched the first
pointsofthe game on an impressive
sequence that
saw five differ-
ent Wolverines "I thi

"After we
made a really
nice defensive
stand on our goal line, we just
started attacking," Trenary said.
"Then the ball goes between five or
six players and we go the full field
and score. Just seeingus utilize the
whole team on that sequence was
really great."
Ohio State answered quickly,
but those were the only points they
would score. The stifling Michigan

defense was helped by two more
tries and the game quickly opened
up in favor of the Wolverines.
This win highlighted the strong
weekend performance by the
Wolverines. They had strong per-
formances on the weekend from
Burke-Combs, who scored in all
three pool-play games, and senior
Alex Davidson, who had three tries
on the weekend.
Statistics aside, Trenary praised
his team's leadership after sud-
denly being thrustinto the national
spotlight.
"Sequoyah is a just a real pas-
sionate, fiery leader," Trenary said.
"He's a great athlete and brings

Though Michigan didn't end
the weekend as a champion, its 3-1
record on the weekend and trip to
the quarterfinals was a benchmark
for the program's success.
And for a sport looking to grow
in popularity on campus, a win
over Ohio State on national televi-
*sion doesn't hurt.

Eligible patients of any age or

ble for surgery. MSHOP has been
used in the University's hospital
system for approximately a year

The program has demonstrated

transformative for the healthcare
field such as MSHOP. The award
is funded by the Patient Protec-

other legislation set through the
centers which aim to lower the
cost of healthcare by providing
more accurate information prior
to surgery and taking measures
to improve patients' health prior

Englesbe added that beyond the
introduction of healthier habits,
MSHOP also uses preoperative

patients see how healthy they are

about surgery.
"A person could be 68 but have
a body equivalent to an 85 year old

ByZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer
Last Saturday, two Michigan
baseball juniors were given an
opportunity to play professional
baseball. But they started to earn
that opportunity years earlier, as
teammates, years before joining
the Wolverines.
The Washington Nationals took
right-hander James Bourque in
the 14th round, and the Detroit
Tigers took left-hander Trent
Szkutnik six rounds later. Both
traveled to Florida this week to
undergo physicals and sign with
their respective teams.
During the season, the two
were key components on one of
the Big Ten's premier pitching

staffs. But their history together
extends before 2014, or even their
three-year careers at Michigan.
Bourque and Szkutnik became
teammates at age 14, as a part of
an Ann Arbor Travelers team that
produced 20 Division I baseball
players and five members of the
2014 Michigan baseball team, and
have been friends since.
Now, the two starkly different
players will finally play for differ-
ent teams, chasing their longtime
dreams of making the show in the
process.
To say Szkutnik and Bourque
are different types of pitchers
would be an understatement.
Szkutnik, the 6-foot left-handed
ace of Michigan's staff, boasts a
solid four-pitch arsenal with the

same fluid motion he's had since
middle school.
"Trent's always been advanced
physically," said Travelers coach
Jordon Banfield, now an assistant
at Illinois-Springfield. "The big-
gest thing for him was getting the
mental ability down to be a next-
level pitcher, but he's always been
an advanced pitcher."
Bourque, who arrived to cam-
pus as a 6-foot-4, 175-pound right-
hander, was far from an ace, and
was dangerously close to quitting
baseball altogether in high school.
But after working with the Travel-
ers and Wolverines, the junior has
added 20 pounds to his long frame
and sports a fastball that can now
reach 96 miles per hour.
"When James came to me, he

was 14, 5-foot-7, 110 pounds and
threw 70 miles an hour," Banfield
said. "He kept growing and devel-
oping physically, but it wasn't
until later on in high school that
he was looking like a real prospect
pitcher. He was interested in other
sports and was looking at schools
for academics, and I had to push
him and his family to stick with
baseball."
Despite the differences, both
were given an opportunity to play
under Banfield at age 14.
The energetic and relentless
training of Banfield, then 23,
allowed both players to develop
into college-ready pitchers.
The Travelers - a squad that
also included Michigan juniors
Donnie Eaton and Kyle Jusick and
sophomore Travis Maezes - won
20 tournament titles and became
the first Michigan team to qualify
for back-to-back Connie Mack
World Series, but it was the off-
season training and dedication
by Banfield that had the greatest
impact.
"Everyone on that team
improved an unbelievable
amount," Szkutnik said. "It really
speaks to the passion (Banfield)
showed to us on and off the field.
Whenever anyone wanted to hit or
throw or work on something, he
was there to make it happen."
The journeys contrasted, but
when Bourque committed to Mich-
igan the spring of his senior year,
the two were going to continue to
be teammates at the next level.
At Michigan, both pitchers

improved each year until 2014,
when the possibility of being
drafted became more possible
than ever for both.
Szkutnik posted a 3.38 earned-
run average and 57 strikeouts in
15 starts for the Wolverines, while
Bourque pitched 40.1 innings in 25
appearances on the mound, strik-
ing out 33 and holding opponents
to a .247 batting average.
"We used to joke around that
we can't wait until we get drafted
our junior year," Bourque said.
"But the closer we got, the more
it became a possibility. Looking
back, the odds were so slim, but
the help we had and the work we
all put in made it happen."
Following draft day, the two
have both made their respective
trips to Florida to sign major-
league contracts, as the former
Ann Arbor Travelers finally travel
away from Ann Arbor.
They won't be teammates
anymore, but after seven years
alongside each other, there's no
questioning the day nearly every
kid dreams about was even more
special when shared with a long-
time teammate.
"As a program, we met every
one of our goals," Banfield said.
"Twenty Division I players, four
players drafted now and there's
definitely still a family and every-
one stays in touch. Even though
the team's in the past, I tell them
all that I'm happy to help if they
want to keep working. All I ask
in return is tickets to their first
games."

pletes the process of modifying its
regulations, low-income individu-
als who borrowed before 2007 or
stopped borrowing before 2011
will also have access to the PAYE
repayment option. Previously,
these borrowers were eligible
for the income repayment plan,
which capped payments at 15% of
discretionary income and offered
loan forgiveness after 25 years.
As of 2011-2012, 38 percent
of University students received
some form of federal direct loan,
according to the National Center
for Education Statistics.
The data doesn't delineate
when borrowers first took out a
loan, which is necessary to cal-

from the White House Council of
Economic Advisers and Domestic
Policy Council released Tuesday
stated the state of Michigan as a
whole has almost 193,000 indi-
viduals who could benefit from
the executive order.
In general, college affordability
has become a pressing concern for
Michigan residents. The state cur-
rently ranks as 45th in the nation
MISS BEING A FR
ORIE

for college affordability, accord-
ing to a yearly report by College
Board, and a May report from the
Center for Michigan found that
college affordability is a top con-
cern for people in the state.
Democratic Congressional
candidate Debbie Dingell, who
has made student loans an area of
focus in her campaign and is also
the chair of Wayne State Univer-
sity's Board of Governors, said
the impact of college affordability
has become a growing issue in the
state.
"I've been on the Wayne State
board for eight years," Dingell
said. "Every single year, it seems
like it's becoming more chal-
lenging and more difficult and
harder to afford a higher edu-
cation. And every single day, I
am meeting young people who
are graduating with staggering
debt."
She added that while college
affordability is a nationwide
issue, in Michigan it may be
particularly pressing because of
trends in public university fund-
ing, which has been dropping
since the early 2000s and was hit
particularly hard when Gover-
nor Rick Snyder instituted a 15%
percent cut in his FY2012 budget.
"It used to be that in Michigan,

higher ed was respected as the
top of the country," she said. "We
stopped investing in higher edu-
cation."
During Monday's announce-
ment,the President also expressed
support for legislation in the U.S.
Senate that would allow borrow-
ers to refinance their student
loans at lower interest rates.
The legislation, which would
benefit 963,000 Michigan bor-
rowers according to the White
House report, was blocked in the
Senate Wednesday following a
Republican filibuster.
However, Mark Kantrowitz,
senior vice president of Edvisors,
which manages several financial
aid and college websites, said
both initiatives may have a lim-
ited impact overall because they
don't address the root causes,
such as the decreasing amount of
non-loan federal money available
for students that lead students to
take out so many loans.
"If we were to double the aver-
age Pell Grant, the debt would go
down," Kantrowitz said. "And
that's the real problem - there's
too much debt at graduation. The
payment plan is a safety net, but
the real problem is the debt in the
first place."

Michigan residents should vote in favor of Proposal 1 in August
n Aug. 5 Michigan residents will have the opportunity
to vote on a state ballot initiative that's set to help
small businesses. If passed, Proposal 1 will begin the
elimination of Michigan's personal property tax on business
and commercial equipment. Most midwestern states overturned
personal property taxes due to various detrimental effects
on state businesses. In 2012, Michigan followed the path of its
surrounding states when the legislation voted to phase out most
aspects of the personal property tax by 2023. Michigan voters
should follow the legislation's direction on this topic and vote yes
on Prop. 1 in the coming fall elections.

bile wiping my hands in
an Angell Hall restroom, a
sticker on the paper towel
dispenser caught
my eye. In friendly
green print, it
said: "These come
from trees." And
I replied, without
sarcasm, "Holy
shit, we must've ;
forgotten." ZAK
I don't mean WITUS
"forgotten" in the
sense of declarative
knowledge -
like, if I asked someone else in the
bathroom where paper towel comes
from, I'm sure they could tell me. I
mean forgotten in the sense of active
or working knowledge; in the moment
of consumption, most people - myself
included - aren't thinking about
what they're actually consuming:
what it's made of, who's making it,
where it comes from, where it goes,
etc. This issue pertains to almost
every commodity that one doesn't
personally produce - everything
from paper products to hamburgers
to gasoline. So, my basic question is,
"Why do we habitually forget the
elementary truths about what it is
we're consuming?" And my basic
answer is, "We forget because we
want to forget."
The next question is: Why do we
want to forget? I think the answer has
to do with the famous saying, "Laws
are like sausages - it's better not to
see them being made." We want to eat
sausage, but if we knew how sausage
was made (or actively thought about
the gruesome details while eating it),
we would probably be too disgusted to
keep eating. So, therefore we ought not
know how sausage is made. This kind of
moral reasoning is ubiquitous in today's
consumerist world, and presumes that
we want to eat and enjoy more than we
wanttoknoworthink,becauseknowing
and thinkingsometimes lead to disgust.
I reject the view that we should sacrifice
knowledge for the sake of enjoyment.
Matter-of-factly speaking, we violate
this moral routinely, but that doesn't
mean it's right.
Our disgust with how sausage is
made seems to reflect an intuitive
moral that we'd rather not confront
consciously. Deep down, many of us
feel that it's wrong to slaughter animals
for food, like how many of us feel it's
wrong to mow down forests for paper
towel. Herein lies a common dilemma
for consumers: we must consume to
survive, but our consumption routinely
violates our own ethics. This is the
biggest psychological and philosophical

problem for today's consumers. To keep
the originofcommodities inmind would
be to consciously violate our own moral
principles and, furthermoreundermine
our mental images of ourselves as moral
beings. The disgust we would feel
would not only be directed externally,
but internally as well. In order to avoid
this anxiety and self-disgust we opt
for the far easy, convenient task of
erasing or suppressing the troublesome
information. And thus we "forget"
where paper towel comes from because
we don't approve of the truth nor do we
approve of ourselves.
A tremendous obstacle in solving
this ethical dilemma lies in a key
enabler of our motivated forgetting: the
physical and consequently psychical
distance between us and the process of
production. We aren't actually seeing
the stuff we're consuming, only the
end product. Today our gaze hardly
extends beyond the reach of our fork;
McDonald's hamburgers seem to
sprout from the ground fully formed.
To subvert this ideology of eating by
suggesting that hamburgers are in fact
cooked cow flesh is considered vulgar
or, as Mom would say, "inappropriate
dinner conversation." For her, as for
many people, thinking about a chicken
(the bird that clucks) while we're eating
chicken (thewhite meatthattastesgood
with gravy) ruins her appetite. Avoiding
the former reality becomes so much.
easier because we don't raise our own
chickens or slaughter our own cows.
"Forgetting" the disgusting reality
of our consumption is imperative for
allowing us to enjoy it.
My hope is that by exposing these
ugly truths we will be forced to
confront them and I won't have to
retain my current view that, "Morals
are like sausages - it's better not to
see them being made." I'd rather we
not erase or suppress troublesome
information. Instead, we should adopt
the far more difficult and inconvenient
task of individual as well as societal
reform and/or revolution. Overall the
challenging solution is that we must
learn to allow ourselves to enjoy less.
So long as we continue to physically and
psychologically cover up, flush away or
otherwise "get rid of" these disgusting
realities, we will continue to violate our
own morals - not to mention destroy
our planet and its inhabitants. But,
if we're willing to critique our own
consumerist habits and sacrifice a bit
of ignorant bliss, then we can align
our actions with our higher ecological
ethics. Maybe then we can live cleanly
on Earth for a little bit longer.

"The Fault in Our Stars" was
first a book written by John
Green, who, building on a huge
and growing edifice of progres-
sive teen fiction, is right now
winning the proverbial lottery in
the Young Adult literature world.
The success of "The Fault in Our
Stars" and the strange apotheosis
of John Green is the culmination
of a large international group of
savvy young adults expressing
their admiration for a writer/
video-blogger who treats young
adults as real people, whose inner
truths resist the sugary simplic-
ity of the genre that names them.
"The Fault in Our Stars" is
about a girl named Hazel Grace
Lancaster (Shailene Woodley,
"Divergent") who, apart from
being a fairly normal teenager,
an avid reader and an introvert,
happens to have a case of Stage
4 thyroid cancer that will almost
definitely kill her in the not-so-
distant future. Her mom, (Laura
Dern, "Jurassic Park"), forces her
to go to a support group for kids
with cancer, where she meets
Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort,
"Divergent"), an endearingly
pompous boy who immediately
starts hitting on Hazel; so begins
the central courtship, between
two teenagers living on borrowed
time.
The cancer movie minigenre is
treacherous territory for up-and-
coming directors like Josh Boone.
Boone had to depend utterly on
his cancer-ridden characters to
cradle the emotional grenade of
imminent death beside the casual
reality of the everyday. In this
respect, this movie knocks it out
of the park. The pacing is simple
but effective, and the leads are
on-point when it most matters.
Unexpectedly, against all prec-
edent, the parents are important
characters whose inclusion cre-
ate an atmosphere that is believ-
able and intimate. Recall that
when kids get romantic arcs in
fiction, there's usually some dis-

tance keeping their interactions at times feels affected, and the

Eliminating the personal
property tax will help attract
businesses to Michigan. The
personal -property tax ensures
businessesmust paytaxes on any
business or office supplies. This
ranges from computers to desks
toland. Sincebusinessesalready
pay the six percent Michigan
sales tax on items when
they're originally purchased,
businesses are essentially
being double-taxed for items.
Businesses will oftentimes take
this cost into consideration
when deciding where to
start a company. Because
Michigan is the only Midwest
state using the property tax,
startups may be deterred
from coming to Michigan.
Therefore, eliminating
the tax effectively boosts
our economy.
Though revenue is unstable,

the personal property tax
makes up large amounts of the
tax revenue in industrial cities.
To ensure municipalities still
have access to revenue after
the personal property tax on
businesses is phased out, the
initiative proposes using funds
from the state use tax that will
total about $600 million in 10
years. The state will allow for
$600 million in business tax
credits to expire during the
same time period to make-
up for the new cost to use
tax revenues.
While incentivizing
businesses is a persuasive
reason to vote yes for Prop. 1,
the property tax is inefficient
for other reasons. Not only does
it double-tax - an improper
and unfair method of gaining
revenue - but the property tax is
also unreliable. Since the prices

of goods fluctuate given the
year, region and idiosyncratic
sales, the money received from
the tax is dependent on avariety
of uncontrollable factors.
The state cannot effectively
predict the generated revenue.
Michigan needs a system that
allows for predictable taxes.
This helps the state create a
more reliable budget, and helps
businesses better predict and
plan for costs.
Prop. 1 includes an effective
method to regain tax money.
Allowing arbitrary and
outdated business tax to expire
is a commendable initiative.
However, voters and the
legislation must ensure that
effective business tax credits
that incentivize green energy
and small business growth
aren't cut during the tax credit
expiration period.

From Page 6
direction, and if you have a semi-
observant eye or just watch a lot
of TV, you'll be able to map out the
trajectory of a lot of subplots as
soon as they appear. Case in point:
as soon as we see a frazzled Polly
walking topless around Larry and
bemoaning her absent husband,
it's inevitable that they're going
to get together. In other plot arcs,
this over-transparency is negated
by a strong cast that picks up the
predictable narrative structure's
slack, but since Larry and Polly
(especially together) offer no
redeemable characterization, it
was superfluous.
Especially since these scenes
take us out of the Lichtfield
microcosm: Season Two integrates
some ambitious commentary on
institutional corruption(especially
prescient with the recent news
on the atrocious conditions at
Riverhead correctional facility,
where OINTB is shot) that felt
absent last season. In one of the
most poignant character arcs, and
one that was constructed with
surprising subtlety and restraint,
Jimmy (Pat Squire) renders a
wholly moving portrait of the
dire mental health and geratric
care afforded to inmates. That
plotline feels more successful
than Figueroa's (Alysia Reiner)
money-laundering one, which falls
into the heavy-handed problem,
though it is reassuring to see the
writers are equal opportunists
about doling out cliches. However,
the theme of external bureaucratic
shuffling provides a smart foil
to the building racial tensions
that dominated Season Two, and
the adjoining prison politics. In
Season One, the prison milieu was
too vast at times, and it evaded any
interesting inter-group conflict
(or just contact). The looming
prison war that Season Two
steadily builds up to addresses that
problem.
On the entertainment side,
the show's comedic writing is
sharper than ever. Not only in the
acerbic prison one-liners (Piper's
memorable line, "He's a hitman?
I thought he was a rapist. I'm so
relieved!"), but also the acerbic and
far-reaching references peppered
throughout (The Fault in the Stars,
Louis Althusser, Big Pharma all get
funny mentions) make the show
undeniably watchable. But that
was never OINTB's weak point.

he more data points, the
better - ask any gradu-
ate student. This is espe-
cially true
for statistical
studies that
draw infer-
ences about a
diverse popu-
lation from a
smaller subset
of N individu- M
als, where N YEE
is referred to
as the sample
size. All else
being equal, larger values of N
lead to concomitant increases in
the ability to detect the presence
of an effect in a particular experi-
ment. Intuitively, one might say
that having more information
available to the observer reduces
uncertainty, and allows for more
confidence in a conclusion well-
supported by
the evidence.
It should come as no surprise
then that just as we glorify stud-
ies where N is large, so too do we
demonize those with small N. As
the sample size decreases, the
faith we have in the experiment
as a whole diminishes rapidly.
Concerns mount about whether
the group in question is represen-
tative of the target population, as
well as whether the results could
have been due to chance alone.
And what of the case srudy,
the special situation where N=1?
Scientists look askance at any
attempt to generalize from a
single data point. When N=1, what
one has isn't an experiment at
all, but an anecdote, an observa-
tion which could just as easily be
a fluke, an aberration, a coinci-
dence.
Perhaps this inherent distrust
of low N is part of what makes
issues surrounding the abuse of
graduate students so hard to tack-
le. Sequestered for days on end
in lab, studio or office, away from
friends, family and loved ones,
the life of a graduate student can
be intensely isolating. Randomly
distributed across campus, blind-
ed to the conditions under which
their peers toil, graduate students
are constantly running parallel
experiments on themselves, with
N=1, attempting to gauge whether
the problems they must deal with
on a daily basis are a result of
extrinsic or intrinsic factors.
The graduate student has a

unique relationship with his or
her advisor. As one's principal
research investigator and some-
times sole source of funding, the
advisor is the hand that feeds,
the eyes that read and the way to
succeed, all at once. "Publish or
perish," the saying goes; without
clear delineation between work
and non-work, between the end of
one project and the beginning of
the next, there can be substantial
pressure on the graduate student
to spend more and more time and
effort in pursuit of an ever-mov-
ing and possibly illusory goal.
Where is the boundary
between keeping one's trainees
on task and overworking those
entrusted to one's supervision?
It's murky enough territory for
the faculty advisor, but for the
graduate student, that division
can be quite indistinct. Though
gathered en masse students often
degenerate into complaints and
commiseration, seldom do they
air those concerns which truly
trouble them, perhaps out of a
fear of revealing a deeply-rooted
intellectual or character flaw;
enough graduate students grapple
with "impostor syndrome" even
outside times of stress. Are the
difficulties that one encounters a
reflection of the research or the
researcher? For the individual,
with N=1, it can be downright
impossible to tell.
Graduate students may be
even more reluctant to speak up
if they perceive there's a chance
of retaliation, or if there is little
expectation that definitive action
will come of the complaint. What
is known for certain is that abuse
has far-reaching effects, contrib-
uting to the increasingly recog-
nized problem of depression on
college campuses as well as the
attrition and burnout that causes
many students to switch advisors
or leave their programs entirely.
Though we have made great
strides in combating exploitation,
ridicule and neglect, much work
remains to be done. For now, stu-
dents remain vulnerable to mis-
treatment, and small sample sizes
make it difficult to gauge whether
or not one's travails are "normal."
For now, ambiguity aids the abu-
sive and vagueness validates the
vindictive. For now, the N justi-
fies the mean.

NETFLIX

Red and Vee have a standoff
Acclaimed Netflix
series returns with
improvement and
diversity
By CATHERINE SULPIZO
For The Daily
"Smart Entertainment" is
the buzzword floating around
"Orange is the New Black",
Netflix's wildly popular original
TV series. It's a case of content

molding to form. By the nature
of Netflix's distribution (all at
once), certain
shows can
maintain their
integrity, but the
best minutely- Orange IS
drawn, complex the New
TV universes
prime time B (
and cable have Sea= Two
given us don't
translate well Netflix
into the binge-
heavy scheme


"Orange is the New Black" was
never expected to be the perfect
meditation on race, oppressive
prison systems and class, but it
still offers up a fairly intelligent
dialogue without sacrificing its
guilty-pleasure roots ... mostly.
In Season One, the structure of
the show often ran up against its
"Smart Entertainment" wall, and
the incredible cast diversity (in
race, sexuality, and body type)
felt like it was wasted on familiar
tropes and stereotypes, like the
sexy Latinas with snappy tongues
or the Black characters who
popped up too often for comic
relief.

By KARSTEN SMOLINSKI
Daily Arts Writer
What if you had to relive the
exact same day, over and over
again? That
may not seem
too terrible
depending on F
the day. What
if it was the day TOmoW
you died?
In the sci-WarnerB .
fi action film Raveand
"Edge of Quality16
Tomorrow", a
military pro-
moter with no
combat experience named Lt.
Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise, "Mis-
sion: Impossible") finds himself
thrust into a mechanized combat
suit and a suicidal assault against
strange alien forces known as the
Mimics. Caught in a time loop
following his first quick death on
the beaches of France, Cage must
play out this fateful "Groundhog
Day" like scenario in the midst
of a gruesome slaughter. He per-
ishes again and again, only to
reawaken on the day before the
attack.
As Cage struggles to survive
each new day, he encounters Spe-
cial Forces soldier Rita Vrataski
(Emily Blunt, "Looper"), a war
hero who experienced a similar
time loop during the sole human
victory at Verdun. Together, they
plan to destroy the alien leader
in a desperate bid to end both the
invasion and Cage's time loop for
good. With each brutal death,
Cage slowly transforms from
hopeless alien bait to flawless
killing machine.
Endlessly repeating the same
day isn't an entirely novel idea.
2011's "Source Code" used a
similar device, and the repeti-
tion could get tiresome quickly.
Watching humans in mechanized
combat suits blast, bombard and
slice up tentacle-waving aliens
does provide an engaging viewing
experience. However, the movie's
massive, explosion packed bat-
tles never stand above the large
pool of action flicks. Luckily, the
action sequences never dominate
the film.
Instead, "Edge of Tomorrow"
shines when showing how Cage
learns to manipulate the events

around him by predicting people's
words and actions. It's almost
like a videogame, with each new
death teaching the player what
not to do before restarting at the
checkpoint. No scenario plays
the same way twice, while the
plot moves at a fast pace to keep
the audience engrossed. Watch-
ing Cage's failed attempts proves
surprisingly humorous even as
repeatedly seeing the bloodied
bodies of his comrades provides
Cage with the incentive to fight
on.
Cruise previously excelled
in sci-fi action in films such as
"Minority Report" or last year's
"Oblivion", and "Edge of Tomor-
row" proves no exception. Blunt.
Cruise and
Blunt balance
wit and
violence
never misses a step as the battle-
hardened badass. Bill Paxton
("Aliens") gives a dead-on target
performance as the no-nonsense,
death-or-glory, duty-bound Mas-
ter Sergeant Farell, adding to
both the laughs and the peculiar
sense of inescapable fate.
With damaged transport
planes falling from the sky like
a burning metal rain and aliens
exploding into glowing goo, the
action in "Edge of Tomorrow"
entertains viewers but never
astounds. Fortunately, while
Cage must use violence to over-
come this alien menace, it's the
film's wit that proves most enjoy-
able. Though learning to over-
come each new death stretches
Cage's endurance to its limits,
the film's quick editing sweeps
audiences along on an effort-
less thrill ride. It may resemble
"Groundhog Day" with a sci-fi
action twist, but this particular
battle for the fate of all man-
kind remains one not quite like
any other, unafraid to explore
the depths of psychological evil
while dealing a fatal blow to the
good guys.

Cruise-ing along

Say what you want,
Tom Cruise is an
awesome movie star
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Film Editor
Of the 37 screen credits to his
name, Tom Cruise runssignificantly
in 19 of them: 19 glorious, unencum-
bered sprints at varying velocities,
each one with its own definitive
qualities. Take "Mission Impos-
sible IV," where Cruise runs at a
90-degree angle down a building,
or "The Firm," where Cruise gal-
lops at blistering speeds in a suit and
suspenders whilst carrying a brief-
case,or"Collateral,"inwhich Cruise
runs doing his best "Tom Cruise as
the Terminator" impression. With

the release of "Edge of Tomorrow,"
Cruise will go for a run again, and
again, and again. Each charge car-
ries a certain bravura, an aesthetic
quality that translates to an art form:
you want to run like Tom Cruise, you
need to run like Tom Cruise.
But Mr. Thomas Mapother IV
brings something else to his films:
exceptional star power. For the last
30 years, no actor has commanded
the screen quite like him: not Hugh
Jackman, not Brad Pitt, not Leon-
ardo DiCaprio and not George Cloo-
ney. Because each of those actors
can bring toughness or subtlety
or charisma to the table, but none
of them do it with Cruise's brand
of flare. No matter the genre, no
matter how bad the movie ("Rock
of Ages"), you're in for a spectacle
when Cruise steps forward.

It's a brand really, the Tom Cruise
film; his characters tend to have
similar trademark characteristics:
the whisper turned shout, the afore-
mentioned running, the smile and
the dazed stare with mouth agape, a
look that radiates a quiet yet burning
intensity. And every character has
those traits because that's what you
want to see, because Cruise looks so
damn cool doing them.
But still, even in the action films,
his characters are rarely one-dimen-
sional franchise drivers. Ethan Hunt
of "Mission Impossible" is constant-
ly balancing his drive for justice with
his desire to have a personal life, and
you can see the pain in his eyes when
one or both of those goals don't work
out. Vincent of "Collateral," Cruise's
finest, most over-looked role, is a
sleek, philosophizing killer with
scars from his past and an unusual
desire to motivate others into orga-
nizing their own life goals - it's a
complicated role that Cruise bal-
ances perfectly. His smaller, sup-
porting parts from "The Outsiders"

to "Tropic Thunder" are always cap-
tivating.
And of course there are his
award-caliber performances in
"Born on the Fourth of July," "Mag-
nolia," "Jerry Maguire" and "A Few
Good Men." Those credits combined
with aresume that includes working
with such directors as Steven Spiel-
berg, Michael Mann, Oliver Stone,
Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick
and Paul Thomas Anderson, among
others, yield a successful, notable
and impressive body of work.
Surprisingly, with "Edge of
Tomorrow," many critics are hailing
Cruise for his expansion into new
acting territory as a coward rather
than a hero - at the age of 51, with
more than 30 years of work and with
enough success that'd make a less
motivated actor complacent, Cruise
can still break new ground for him-
self.
Yes, maybe Cruise's ego occasion-
ally writes a check you don't really
want to cash, maybehe seems a little
off every now and again, but the guy

does pretty much always deliver -
these last fewyears, his filmshaven't
been quite up-to-par with most of
his previous works, but Cruise noth-
ing if not resilient.
I don't know if I'd call Cruise
an artist, maybe a performer with W
flashes of artistry, like Sonny &
Cher, but he deserves credit where
credit is due: for changing the action
genre with "Mission Impossible"
and again with "Minority Report,"
for the 80s classics "Risky Business"
(and the joke that is "Top Gun") and
for defining the modern romantic
comedy in "Jerry Maguire," but per-
haps most importantly for providing
audiences with an unparalleled sort
of entertainment for thirty years.
Cruise knows what he is, and 4
the public should know too. He's
a personality, an entertainer and
sometimes even a caricature, and
he's fantastic at what he does. Ever
self-aware, his twitter bio states the
following: actor, producer, running
in movies since 198L Here's to many -
more Cruise - keep on running.
