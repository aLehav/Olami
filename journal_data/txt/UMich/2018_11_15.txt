The Women’s Organization 

on 
Rights 
to 
Health 
and 

the South Asian Awareness 
Network 
hosted 
an 
open 

discussion Wednesday night 
to explore the topic of sexual 
health 
education 
in 
South 

Asian countries.

The event “That’s Haram!: 

Sex 
Ed 
in 
South 
Asian 

Communities,” compared the 
teachings of sexual education 
in South Asian and American 
cultures, both of which have 
certain stigmas surrounding 
the issue.

First-year Medical student 

Sai Talluru said she thinks 
there are many similarities 
between sexual education in 
South Asian countries and 
the United States, one of the 
most common topics being 
abstinence.

“I 
think 
abstinence 
is 

definitely something that is 
implied or talked about (in 
sexual 
education), 
and 
it’s 

not always the best option,” 
Talluru said. “It’s just not as 
transparent of a conversation 

The Donia Human Rights 

Center held a panel Wednesday 
night to examine the impact of 
the current “zero-tolerance” 
policy of detaining refugee 
children seeking asylum in the 
U.S. This policy calls for the 
prosecution of all individuals 
who illegally enter the United 
States, which has resulted in the 
detention of refugee children 
who are separated from their 
families.

More than 50 guests attended 

the panel, which was hosted at 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
and consisted of Law professor 
James 
C. 
Hathaway, 
the 

director of Program in Refugee 
and 
Asylum 
Law; 
Sherrie 

Kossoudji, associate professor 
at School of Social Work; and 
Ann Lin, associate professor 
and the Public Policy School.

The 
panel 
examined 
the 

psychological, 
political 
and 

legal impact of the policy on 
the families, policy makers 
and public opinion, asking the 
question of what’s at stake.

COMMUNITY AFFAIRS

At 
all 
times 
of 
day, 

crosswalks on the University 
of Michigan’s campus are 
among the most traversed 
in the city. Some of them 
are 
well-marked 
— 
the 

intersection of State Street 
and South University Avenue, 
protected by stop signs on all 
sides with vehicles directed 
by a four-way stop, is one of 
the most heavily trafficked.

Just a few yards away, 

at the intersection of State 
Street 
and 
East 
Madison 

Street, though, pedestrians 
cross the street regularly, 
even though no crosswalk 
existed there until earlier 
this year. The crosswalk is 
now marked by painted lines 
as a legal pathway from the 
pedestrian 
view. 
From 
a 

driver’s perspective, no signs 

clearly indicate the presence 
of the crosswalk.

Law student Akash Patel 

said he and 64 other law 
students have filed complaints 
with the city regarding the 
crosswalk’s safety. Many of 
the complaints cited near 
collisions with drivers while 
attempting to cross the street.

Patel 
has 
worked 
on 

a 
campaign 
to 
increase 

awareness in the city of 
Ann Arbor of the danger 
of the crosswalk. He said 
the 
crossing 
is 
especially 

dangerous in winter when 
daylight hours dwindle.

“Hundreds 
of 
students 

of all different years and 
programs use that crosswalk, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
visible 

indication to cars that it is a 
crosswalk, especially at night 
since, that paint is not visible 
after dark,” Patel wrote in 
an email interview. “This is 
particularly a problem in a

Young anti-gun violence activists given 
2018 Wallenberg Medal for courage

MIKE ZLONKEVICZ/DAILY

Student activists and youth leaders Rie’Onna Holmon, Sofie Whitney, Ke’Shon Newman and Alex Wind speak at the Wallenberg Medal Presentation and Lecture at 
Rackham Auditorium Wednesday evening. The event recognized students advocating across the country to end gun violence.

Everywhere and March for 
Our Lives were presented the 
26th annual Wallenberg Medal 
by the University of Michigan 
Wednesday night.

The medal is presented in 

honor of Raoul Wallenberg, a 
U-M alum who saved tens of 
thousands of Jews in Budapest 

during World War II. The 
award recognizes the honorable 
actions 
of 
humanitarians 

reminiscent 
of 
Wallenberg’s 

bravery.

The 
University 
chose 
to 

honor two groups pioneering 
change in the fight against gun 
violence. Rie’Onna Holmon and 
Ke’Shon Newman accepted the 
award on behalf of B.R.A.V.E, an 
organization based in Chicago 
that focuses on training youth 
to be peacemakers within their 
communities. Alex Wind and 
Sofie Whitney accepted the 

award on behalf of March for 
Our Lives, an organization 
created after 17 students at 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 

High School in Parkland, Fla., 
were killed by an active shooter 
on Feb. 14. Wind and Whitney 
were both students of the 
school at the time.

University President Mark 

Schlissel presented the awards, 
commending the honorees for 
their commitment to improving 
society. 
He 
stressed 
the 

importance of tackling all types 
of gun violence, from mass 

shootings to everyday firearm 
assault. 

“The 
tragedies 
of 
this 

epidemic go far beyond the 
shootings 
that 
grab 
the 

headlines,” Schlissel said. “Gun 
violence is an everyday reality 
in many neighborhoods around 
our nation. It steals life from 
our families and communities, 
affecting innocent youth as 
they walk to and from school 
and as they gather with their 
friends.”

MOLLY NORRIS

Reyna 
Ortiz, 
Chicago 

activist and educator, who 
helps 
connect 
transgender 

youth 
and 
women 
with 

medical, legal, education and 
housing 
resources, 
opened 

a 
presentation 
Wednesday 

by emphasizing the progress 
made by and within the trans 
community throughout time.

Ortiz has been doing activist 

work in the trans community 
since her transition in 1994 at 
14 years old.

“I’m 
fighting 
for 
the 

liberation 
of 
the 
trans 

community in this country 
and in this world,” Ortiz said. 
“It’s my passion; it is my life. 
All my life experiences as 
a trans person for 25 years 
has brought me to this point, 
today, working and fighting 
for equality for trans people.”

Ortiz spoke at the School 

of Social Work as part of 
the Trans Awareness Week 
series of events hosted by 
the Spectrum Center at the 
University of Michigan. She 
was the keynote speaker of the 
series and raised awareness of 
issues facing the transgender, 
genderqueer and gender non-
conforming communities.

Ortiz 
recalled 
the 

loneliness she felt when she 
came out as trans-identifying 
at a young age. She said for 
so long, she felt she was the 
only trans person in her 

community. This experience, 
Ortiz explained, helps her 
connect with the people she 
works with.

“I think starting off trans so 

young, feeling so many types 
of ways about being trans is 
the reason why I work so well 
with youth in Chicago,” Ortiz 
said.

The services Ortiz’s two 

trans 
resource 
programs 

include are GED preparation 

programs, 
permanent 

and 
supportive 
housing 

research, and legal services 
for 
name-changing 
and 

criminal expungement. She 
said she’s able to see 60 to 
80 participants weekly and 
found 
50 
kids 
supportive 

housing this past year.

This work is not just for 

trans people, though, Ortiz 
said. She emphasized the 
importance 
of 
allyship, 

urging allies to be active, 
consistent and to focus on 
the 
communities 
they’re 

supporting. Ortiz also noted 
everyone has different roles 
to fulfill in the movement.

“It’s a call to action,” Ortiz 

said. “It’s being consistent. 
It’s about finding something 
that you feel is beneficial to a 
community. And it’s different 
for everybody, not everybody 
is going to do the same thing,

“Do you think Thanksgiving 
should be a national holiday? 
Why or why not?” 

I think historically 
Thanksgiving has 
been a national 
holiday as a time 
for Americans to 
come together 
and celebrate their 
friends and their 
family and for that 
reason I think that 
the intention is 
fantastic. However, 
we have to realize 
the implications of 
where the holiday 
originated and 
understand that 
we persecuted the 
groups that we once 
celebrated with.

This Week in History 

the awards, each panelist 
got the chance to introduce 
themselves. Wind began by 
addressing the crowd and 
thanking 
them 
for 
their 

commitment to this cause. 
He said since the Parkland 
shooting nine months ago, 

he has been inspired by 
the hope he has seen around 
him.

“Since that day, I’ve had a lot 

of time to think,” Wind said. 
“And what I see everywhere 
I go is hope. What I think is 
most important for me to be 
here today to tell all of you 
is that you are the hope that 
I see. And I want to thank all 
of you for coming out tonight 
because it means that you 

care. It means that you care 
enough about gun violence 
to try and stop it. And I think 
that is the most important 
thing, is that we are here to 
stop gun violence.”

Wind followed this up by 

urging the audience to act on 
their empathy and call their 
congressmen.

“I want to give you all a 

little job,” Wind said. “When 
you go home, and it doesn’t 

have to be today, just 
this week, even if it’s this 
month, and I want you to 
call your congressman 
and I want you to say 
that 
you 
want 
gun 

violence legislation to be 
passed … The next step 
is making sure that the 
people that we vote for 
are actually representing 
our views, and we will 
not get anywhere unless 
we take that initiative, 
unless we actually pick 
up the phone.”

Sixteen-year-old 

Ke’Shon Newman, one of 
the representatives from 
B.R.A.V.E, 
shared 
his 

personal gun violence 
tragedy 
with 
the 

audience.

“On May 2nd 2016, my 

brother was shot nine 
times and killed due to 
him being in between 
crossfire,” 
Newman 

said. “That day brought 
my 
family 
so 
much 

trauma, not just because 
of his death, but because 
of fear that another day 

my mother might lose another 
son, because of where we live 
and because of the way that 
the conditions are right now.”

Newman 
said 
he 
was 

unwilling 
to 
allow 
his 

brother to become another 
statistic. He decided to join 
B.R.A.V.E to make a change 
in his community so another 
tragedy 
doesn’t 
have 
to 

happen to another family.

“I’m tired,” Newman said. 

“I’m tired of losing loved 
ones, I’m tired of fear inside 
of everyone’s heart. I’m tired 
of people portraying a Black 
man as a threat or portraying 
them as a gang member, or 
saying that they were inside 
that incident because they 
were inside of a gang. I’m 
tired of someone being pulled 
over and shot because they 
thought they had a weapon, 
when they were really trying 
to brush their hair.”

Wind 
shared 
this 

sentiment, also illustrating a 
frustration with the dangers 
Americans have to live with 
every single day.

“We should not be afraid 

to send people to school,” 
Wind said. “We should not 
be afraid to send people to 
grocery stores. We should not 
be afraid to go to a bar, to a 
nightclub, to a movie theater. 
We should not be living in 
fear due to gun violence in 
this country, and we need 
things to change.”

Whitney 
described 
to 

the audience the day of the

Parkland shooting, and the 
sheer disbelief she felt when 
she heard gunshots inside of 
her own school.

“We 
live 
in 
a 
very 

privileged 
community,” 

Whitney said. “So I was 
in denial, I was in shock. 
I obviously ran back into 
the classroom, and in my 
head the entire time I was 
thinking, ‘This isn’t real. 
This would never happen to 
us. This is our school.’”

Whitney 
described 

the sadness felt by her 
community the day after the 
shooting, and she said she 
knew in that moment that 
something had to change.

“We woke up the next 

day and we went to a vigil,” 
Whitney said. “More people 
than I have literally ever 
seen, I think the entire city 
of Parkland was there, and 
that’s a lot of people. And 
it was just so sad. Like, I’ve 
never 
experienced 
such 

sadness, and it was just, 
there was so much of it, and 
we needed to do something.”

Following 
the 

introductions, 
the 
panel 

took questions from the 
audience, 
and 
audience 

members asked what they 

could do to help.

Panelists stressed the need 

for well-placed support from 
adults, and the challenges 
they face when adults don’t 
listen 
to 
them. 
Holmon 

expressed 
disappointment 

in the coverage she felt the 
B.R.A.V.E organization has 
received from the media.

“Being heard is a big 

challenge for us, because 
they don’t listen to a bunch 
of 
Black 
kids 
that 
are 

advocating for themselves,” 
Holmon 
said. 
“With 

Parkland, they’re passionate 
about their movement and 
what 
they’re 
doing. 
But 

media, they look at us and 
we’re just angry Black kids.”

Overall, 
the 
panelists 

pleaded with the audience to 
put pressure on their elected 
officials and use their voices 
to the best of their ability.

“Everyone is realizing that 

change-making doesn’t have 
an age limit,” Whitney said. 
“As long as you’re passionate 
about something, and as 
long as you truly believe that 
you’re doing the right thing, 
then quite literally anything 
is possible.”

THE BIG CHAIR

RUCHITA IYER/Daily

Former Los Angeles Dogers General Manager Ned Colletti Jr. discusses his book, “The Big Chair,” and current policy challenges in 
professional and collegiate athletics at Ford Wednesday afternoon. 

place like Ann Arbor where 
our 
days 
are 
really 
short 

during our long winters, which 
means sunlight will not help 
illuminate that crosswalk for as 
much of the day as we need.”

Patel has witnessed near 

collisions between pedestrians 
and drivers because of the 
crosswalk’s lack of indication.

“Just this weekend, I saw a 

pedestrian and a student on 
a skateboard almost get hit 
because one car coming from 
one 
direction 
stopped 
but 

another car from the other 
direction didn’t,” Patel said.

One 
of 
the 
anonymous 

complaints to the city came 
from a blind student, who noted 
their 
additional 
difficulty 

associated 
with 
using 
the 

crossing.

“The new crosswalk on the 

north side of the T-intersection 
where Madison meets State 
Street. has created unintended 
hazards. This is particularly 
concerning for me, as a blind 
individual, 
because 
I 
stop 

at the crosswalk, wait, and, 
hearing no cars, expect and 
begin to cross,” the complaint 
read. “A problem arises if I 

am crossing and there are no 
lights to indicate to cars that a 
crosswalk exists. I cannot see 
the cars because I am blind; 
but, the cars should see me.”

According to an Aug. 30 

report Councilmember Kathy 
Griswold, D-Ward 2, sent to The 
Daily, the city’s prioritization 
process 
for 
determining 

construction funding considers 
vehicle crash incidents within 
the past five years, public 
requests 
and 
proximity 
to 

heavily trafficked areas, such 
as schools and government 
offices.

The 
report 
ranks 
the 

crosswalk at E. Madison and 
State 
streets 
a 
“mid-level” 

priority.

Griswold says the crosswalk 

is not well marked compared 
to others on the same street, 
many crosswalks on campus 
include pedestrian signs and 
flashing lights on both sides of 
the street.

“I noticed on State Street 

that the other crosswalks were 
well marked,” Griswold said. 
“Drivers are expecting to see 
signage. Engineers from the 
city should also look at the 
traffic pattern because I saw 
many more students crossing 
on the south side of State Street 
where there isn’t a crosswalk.”

Griswold also thinks the 

width of the road is a safety 
concern.

“I was amazed at the number 

of students crossing and the 
volume,” Griswold said. “I got 
out of my car and I think there 
was maybe six inches between 
me and the vehicles because the 
road doesn’t seem really wide 
there.”

Griswold 
noted 
the 

University’s 
pedestrian-level 

streetlights, which are globe 
shaped, 
are 
more 
energy 

efficient but do not illuminate 
the crosswalk. She hopes to 
see the City Council highlight 
mobility concerns throughout 
the city once she begins her 
term later this month.

“I would like to get more 

emphasis on it (mobility issues) 
because things are changing so 
quickly and the technology is 
changing so quickly,” Griswold 
said. “In Ann Arbor, we’ve 
struggled 
with 
inconsistent 

marks on our crosswalks for 
years now.”

Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor said the 
city is committed to pedestrian 
safety, but did not say whether 
there were plans to address the 
problems at the crosswalk at 
State and E. Madison.

“It’s important to the city 

that 
pedestrians 
be 
safe,” 

Taylor said.

families 
was 

in fact a negotiating tool to 
get Democrats to cave on his 
immigration demands,” she said.

Kossoudji 
continued 
to 

illuminate the conditions of the 
children in detention. She said 
despite adults and children in 
detention having defined rights, 
the reports about the detention 
conditions reflect neglect, abuse 
and widespread indifference to 
the well-being of the children, 
families and adults.

Children 
were 
kept 
in 

customs, border control and 
detention for longer than the 
allowed 72 hours, and they 
“often had no oversight, they 
often had little in the way of 
reasonable food, blankets, toys, 
books, anything you might think 
of as something reasonable.”

Kossoudji further described 

the conditions in which the 
children were held.

“The 
eyewitness 
accounts 

were that hundreds of immigrant 
children wait in series of cages 
created by metal fencing … One 
cage had 20 children inside,” she 
said. “Scattered about are bottles 

of water, bags of chips and large 
foil sheets intended to serve as 
blankets.”

Kossoudji described how the 

staff is not allowed to touch 
the children and neither are 
children allowed to touch each 
other, resulting in a lack of 
human contact when a child 
is crying or frightened. The 
detainment for the children, 
according to Kossoudji, can 
result in social and emotional 
distress, mental and physical 
health 
consequences, 
poor 

education outcomes, short and 
long term family disruption, and 
mistrust in law enforcement.

Lin continued the discussion, 

focusing on how the “zero-
tolerance” policy came to be, 
and questioning whether the 
U.S. is actually in a crisis that 
warrants this policy. She pointed 
to a long term decline in border 
apprehensions.

Furthermore, 
Lin 
pointed 

to 
the 
murder 
rate 
and 

governmental 
issues 
in 
the 

Northern 
Triangle, 
an 
area 

in 
Central 
America 
that 

encompasses 
Guatemala, 

Honduras and El Salvador and 
is known for its heightened rate 
of violence, as the motivation for 
refugees coming to the U.S.

“People are living in a stage 

of crisis,” she said. “So it is 
not 
surprising 
under 
those 

conditions, as we see across the 
world, if people are living in a 
state of crisis, they will try to 
leave.”

Lin said the effect of the 

“zero-tolerance” policy is that 
refugees are charged with the 
crime of crossing the border, 
which means, unless they can 
provide bail, they are placed in 
detention until they can come 
before a judge, after which they 
usually receive a longer ban for 
returning to the U.S.

Moreover, Lin said, since 

children are not allowed to be 
detained in adult jails, they are 
separated from the adults.

Hathaway also weighed on the 

legal implications of the policy, 
criticizing how the new policy 
and conditions for refugees do 
not act in accordance with the 
law.

“The mess that we are seeing 

reflects a failure by the United 
States, not just by the Trump 
administration but long standing 
by both democratic and republic 
administration,” he said.

He stated that despite signing 

a treaty that states no one shall 
be subjected to arbitrary arrest 
or detention, the U.S. routinely 
detains asylum seekers, and 
that the U.S. are not honoring 
the legal system nor the treaty 
the U.S. helped draft and design 
itself.

He further said refugees are 

entitled to arrive wherever to 
seek protection, as long as they 
claim 
protection. 
Refugees 

are not doing anything illegal, 
Hathaway explained, yet they 
are still penalized.

Hathaway said even if refugees 

meet all of the requirements 
set by the U.S. domestically, the 
government is still not required 
to give them refuge, despite this 
going against the international 
laws under which the U.S. is 
bound.

LSA senior Arooshe Giroti 

said she and fellow LSA senior 
Josh Greenberg attended the 
event to learn more about the 
legality of the refugee situation.

“We 
are 
both 
interested 

in the rights of refugees and 
international law, specifically 
how it relates to what’s going 
on at the southern border, so we 
just wanted to learn more about 
legally what’s happening and 
not just get a more superficial 
understanding of it through 
news outlets or social media.”

Sociology professor Kiyoteru 

Tsutsui, director of the Donia 
Human 
Rights 
Center 
and 

Center for Japanese Studies, 
also remarked the issue of 
the 
detainment 
of 
refugee 

children, despite its importance, 
has somewhat faded in the 
background in the debate.

“The main purpose is to 

inform 
the 
public 
and 
the 

university constituents about 
this 
particular 
topic 
that 

attracted a lot of attention but 
kind of subsided, but I bet the 
issue will come back,” Tsutsui 
said.

you have to find your niches.”

Challenging the audience 

further, 
Ortiz 
reminded 

everyone though there has 
been 
much 
progress, 
it’s 

crucial to acknowledge the 
trans activists of the past — 
many of them being trans 
women of color — such as 
Sylvia Rivera. The work of 
these women in the 1960s and 
’70s, she highlighted, set the 
foundation for all work being 
done today.

“Pay 
homage 
to 
the 

queens,” Ortiz said. “To think 
about being trans-identified 
women of color in the ’60s and 
the ’70s, it just blows my mind 
the level of survival these 
women had to go through. So 
when you think about gender 
fluidity in 2018 and how open 
everyone is, it’s wonderful, 
it is progress, but sometimes 
we do have to pay homage 
to the queens. They laid the 
foundation for gender fluidity 
in this country.”

This idea resonated with 

Kari Nilsen, a Social Work 
and Public Health student 
who 
came 
to 
the 
event 

because of their non-binary 

trans-masculine identity and 
because of their desire to 
work in Ortiz’s field. Nilsen 
talked of the significance 
of recognizing the different 
racial identities within the 
trans community and repeated 
Ortiz’s message of paying 
homage to the “queens.”

“It’s 
really 
important 

that we make sure to have 
an intersectional lens and 
recognize that the people that 
have done the work are trans 
women of color,” Nilsen said.

Nilsen further emphasized 

another 
of 
Ortiz’s 
points, 

which was to always ask about 
someone’s gender identity and 
never assume.

“One thing you all can 

do to be an ally is in every 
single introduction ask what 
someone’s 
pronouns 
are,” 

Nilsen said. “Because it’s just 
like your name, it’s just how 
you’re referred to. It’s the 
exact same thing and there’s 
no way you can know without 
asking.”

Social Work student Erica 

Watson said she came to 
learn about the challenges of 
the trans community face — 
something 
especially 
close 

to home because of her queer 
identity and her partner’s 
trans identity.

“I came because I identify 

as queer and my partner is 
trans, and I’m always trying 
to learn as much as I can about 
the community and really 
engage with the community 
and I think the best way to do 
that is to really listen to the 
people who are experiencing 
these things,” Watson said.

Watson 
expressed 
her 

appreciation 
of 
Ortiz’s 

discussion of the positives 
happening 
in 
the 
trans 

community and in trans social 
work. This type of discussion 
is especially imperative in a 
time full of negative news and 
policies.

“I get lost often in the idea 

that everything seems bad and 
it’s only getting worse, and 
it feels overwhelming, like 
there’s nothing you can do and 
I think it’s really good to take 
time and look at the work that 
people have been doing and 
will continue to do,” Watson 
said.

Ortiz left the audience with 

words empowering the trans 
community.

“This 
society 
needs 
to 

understand that trans people 
are here, we have been here 
and we will always be here,” 
Ortiz said.

as you’d like, and I feel like 
people aren’t open about it and 
there’s a lot of shame.”

LSA junior Sumrah Jilani 

agreed 
sexual 
education 

in both South Asia and the 
United States is a difficult 
topic for educators. She said it 
is important to eliminate the 
stigma against sex education 
in these places so people will 
be able to have comfortable 
conversations about the issue.

“I think one of the biggest 

things we highlighted was a lot 
of the misconceptions that are 
out there,” Jilani said. “There’s 
such a big stigma associated 
with anything related to sex, 
and getting rid of that stigma 
and making it so that it’s not 
a super taboo topic, so that 
people are able to talk about it 
and learn about it in a healthy 
way and know what all of the 
risks are and consider all of the 
factors. I feel like that’s really 
important.”

LSA junior Liliana Pfeifer, 

co-president of WORTH, an 
organization 
that 
promotes 

activism for women’s health 
rights, said inclusivity should 
be emphasized when learning 
about sexual health. This would 
produce a more well-rounded 
sexual education.

“I learned the importance of a 

comprehensive sex education,” 
Pfeifer 
said. 
“Including 

genders, races, cultures and 
the LGBTQ community is very 
important, and making sure the 
people who are doing the sex 
educating are trained in that 
intersectional perspective.”

Participants 
also 
shared 

their own personal experiences 
with sex education in these 
countries. Talluru said she 
wishes her sexual education 
was more comprehensive.

“I had a very biology-focused 

sex ed. My own parents never 
really talked to me about sex 
ed,” Talluru said. “Definitely 
not comprehensive. Definitely 
would have liked to learn more 
growing up.”

Jilani said the multitude of 

perspectives present made the 
discussion more valuable.

“I 
think 
this 
discussion 

was really interesting because 
we got to kind of hear a lot of 
different perspectives,” Jilani 
said. “While a lot of people here 
were South Asian, they all grew 
up in different backgrounds 
and a lot of people had different 
experiences … There were also 
a few people here who weren’t 
South Asian but still were 
able to relate to a lot of the 
experiences or shed light on 
their own experiences as well.”

CURRICULUM
From Page 1


I 
 

expected the world to look 
different when I woke up 
last Wednesday. I don’t 
know exactly what 
I 
expected 
it 
to 
look like; perhaps 
I thought I would 
see 
catchy 
quotes 
lighting up the sky 
in bold pink font, 
proclaiming that the 
future is female and 
therefore that I am 
the future. Maybe 
I expected the sun 
to 
shine 
a 
little 
differently, to reflect on the 
crimson maple trees around 
campus so the leaves would 
glow like a thousand little 
stars and light my path as I 
walked down State Street to my 
economics lecture.
For the past two years, I 
had been told Tuesday would 
be my chance to change the 
world. Instagram had been 
flooded with glossy images of 
feminism and intersectionality 
that promised a better life for 
us all if we would simply vote. 
We were told that if we voted 
on Tuesday, we would have 
a chance to paint America 
sparkly pink and wrap it up 
with a bow. We were told our 
fate was in our hands if we 
would just show up to the polls. 
So we showed up. We voted in 
record numbers. 
It was a groundbreaking 
election. We, as voters, decided 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will 
be the youngest woman ever 
to serve in Congress, Ilhan 
Omar will be the first Somali-
American in Congress, Sharice 
Davids and Deb Haaland will 
be the first Native American 
women in Congress, and Letitia 
James will be the first African 
American woman to serve as 
New York’s attorney general, 
among several other decisions. 
We decided it’s finally time 
for over 100 women to serve in 
Congress. For a split second, 
I let myself get caught up in 
the hope and hype. I thought 
maybe when I woke up, things 
would look and feel at least a 
little different.
Then, 
Wednesday 
night, 
more than a dozen people were 
brutally murdered on American 
soil simply for spending time at 
a country music bar.
After 20 years of living in 
this country, I should have 
known better. I should have 
known the country has never 

been glossy and pink and hope 
always appears to be in vain.
One of my good friends grew 
up 
near 
Thousand 
Oaks, Calif., which 
was 
the 
location 
of the shooting. I 
didn’t talk to her 
much about it, but 
I know she spent 
most 
of 
Thursday 
in 
mourning. 
Real 
people in Thousand 
Oaks 
— 
people 
with 
families 
and 
dreams 
to 
change 
the world — simply went out 
to enjoy their evening at a bar, 
and now they’re dead. Gone. 
Executed for committing the 
unforgivable crime of existing 
on American soil.
On Friday, the same friend 
sent me a video of her neighbor’s 
house in California, engulfed in 
a blanket of sinister flames that 
danced with gleeful knowledge 
of the destruction they were 
causing. 
Historic 
wildfires 
have taken over the region, and 
have now killed more than 30 
people. Thousands of families 
have lost their homes, and 
dozens have lost someone they 
love.
How 
are 
we 
possibly 
supposed to find hope when 
there seems to be nothing but 
death from sea to shining sea?
Personally I know of two 
activities that give me hope: 
When I’m loving kids and when 
I’m telling stories.
It’s fairly simple, actually. I 
volunteer for two really great 
organizations: one for which I 
spend time with 10th graders 
in Detroit and one for which 
I hang out with middle school 
students 
in 
my 
hometown. 
To me, nothing beats being 
with these kids, hearing about 
their classes and career goals 
and their crushes. And telling 
stories – well, you can already 
see God gave me a love for 
words, and when I sit down and 
put them on paper, it just feels 
right, like all my confusing 
thoughts finally have a purpose.
There’s 
nothing 
profound 
about either of those things, 
and they won’t put an end to 
mass tragedy, but they give me 
a small opportunity to make 
the world a little bit better, 
and when faced with that 
opportunity, I’m going to take 
it.
As heartbroken as I am by the 
current state of our country, 

I am a proud American and I 
consider it my honor to perform 
my civic duties. I’m an informed 
voter and I’ve participated in 
multiple protests when voting 
didn’t seem to be enough. I 
actively reach out to my elected 
officials. If you’re an American 
and you don’t do those things, 
it’s high time to ask yourself 
why not. Nothing is going to 
change if we don’t demand 
change.
But I have another civic 
duty, one that wasn’t listed 
in my Advanced Placement 
Government textbook: to sit 
in a middle school cafeteria 
and listen to 12-year-old girls 
complain 
about 
their 
gym 
classes. Every one of us has 
more civic duties. Some of 
us are called to improve the 
country by helping advance 
our computer systems, or to do 
research on cells, or to bring 
beauty to people’s lives through 
art.
I beg of each and every one 
of you: Do what you were put 
on this planet to do. That’s 
your civic duty. You can’t 
singlehandedly prevent tragedy 
from ever occurring again, but 
there are plenty of things you 
can do to make this broken, 
hurting country a little bit more 
joyful.
This 
isn’t 
a 
call 
to 
complacency, telling you to 
follow your dreams instead of 
fighting for change. Far from 
it, in fact. Please do everything 
you can to enact change in 
this 
world 
because 
we 
so 
desperately need it in more 
ways than I can begin to list in 
this column.
My call, instead, is for you 
to remember though we may 
never see bold pink words 
engraved in the skies, though 
perhaps we will always find 
ourselves in a country of 
mass tragedy and heartbreak, 
we can never be stripped of 
our hope. There is always 
something we can do to make 
today a little bit better. And in 
two years’ time, when our fate 
is once more in our own hands, 
I hope we believe it, and show 
up to the polls again, and, 
despite everything, I hope 
we continue to vote in record 
numbers.

T

his experience we call 
college has the potential 
to be the most integral 
quest 
for 
self-discovery 
in 
our lives. Exalted in popular 
imagination as a wild, inspiring 
and fulfilling era, adults often 
reminisce 
on 
their 
college 
years with a wistful smile. This 
is because people in college 
are 
afforded 
the 
freedom 
of 
adulthood 
without 
its 
consequential 
responsibility. 
Yes, many students work and 
pay their way through college, 
and some have to sacrifice a lot 
to make college happen, but few 
wrestle with the true pressures 
and entanglements of adulthood 
like raising a child, nurturing a 
marriage, and paying taxes and 
mortgages for an entire family. 
By its very design, college can be 
an inherently selfish time. You 
set off on your own adventure 
and find out what’s important 
to you and who you are. You’re 
constantly concerning yourself 
with what classes you’re going 
to take, who you’re going to 
develop 
relationships 
with 
or what organizations you’re 
going to participate in across 
campus. There’s the danger that 
you might develop a routine 
blindness to the people who 
brought you to college in the 
first place: your parents.
By parents I don’t just mean 
biological parents. Perhaps you 
were influenced more by your 
grandparents or a teacher or 
community organizer (further 
references to “parents” herein 
indicate the people or person 
who 
raised, 
mentored 
or 
otherwise supplied you with 
the building blocks from which 
you constructed yourself). A 
parent can take many forms, 
but whoever they are, there’s a 
chance you’ve become numb to 
their struggles in your constant 

juggling of the new and exciting. 
“They didn’t get me into college! 
I did through hard work and 
determination,” 
you 
might 
assert. As a matter of fact some 
people at college even have 
an unfortunately adversarial 
relationship with the people 
who raised them because of past 

complication or hardship.
The 
important 
truth 
to 
recognize here is regardless of 
the tone of your relationship 
with your parents, they still 
represent the order around 
which you oriented yourself in 
the world. Whether someone 
has a close and loving or 
contentious 
and 
distant 
relationship with their parents 
— the philosophy of life that 
you’ve inherited from them 
is your familiar anchor in the 
world, the truth from which you 
go out and explore. 
Whether 
you 
consciously 
realize it, those elements are 
the very things that stabilize 
your life. Discovery, the new 
and uncharted, is chaos. That’s 
where learning comes from, 
exposing yourself to something 
beyond order so that you might 
incorporate it into yourself 
and expand. Too much chaos, 
and your life might fall out of 
balance. Too little, and you’ll 
never learn, grow or change. 
But how do you embrace the 
chaos without throwing the 

order your parents gave you 
out the window? How do you 
create your own values without 
desecrating 
the 
ones 
your 
parents instilled in you? How do 
you discover yourself without 
leaving them behind?
Start by trying to understand 
and appreciate the kind of 
order your parents have given 
you. Partly as a function of 
our mutual respect, effective 
communication and openness, 
I’ve 
been 
fortunate 
in 
my 
relationship with my parents. 
Their order has helped instill 
in me values that allow me to 
make sound judgments and 
balance the temptations and 
opportunities presented to me 
as a young person living away 
from home. One ingredient 
of this order is my parents’ 
conscientiousness. 
My 
dad 
organizes his briefcase and 
closet every night before work. 
He arms each pocket and drawer 
with a toolbox of materials 
for nearly every situation: a 
backup 
pair 
of 
headphones 
and medicine for a theoretical 
future cold. It’s the doomsday 
prepper of briefcases, a trait 
accumulated from a lifetime of 
being prepared to face chaos for 
him and his family. My mom, too, 
has a specialization in making 
our 
home 
feel 
perpetually 
organized, 
comfortable 
and 
safe. It isn’t just tidiness. My 
mom is establishing order in our 
house so that those who enter 
know that this is a place safe 
from the chaos of the world, 
that this is a home in the truest 
sense of the word.

Hope amid tragedy

Integrating parents into the college experience

The joint campaign’s ethos 
is “Whether you or someone 
you know is struggling, there 
are 
counseling 
services 
available to everyone at the 
university … We’re here for 
you.” U-M mental health 
service 
providers 
also 
expressed the hope that this 
campaign will open up the 
campus to new conversations 
about mental and emotional 
health.
As students, most of our 
mental health falls under 
the 
guidance 
of 
CAPS. 
Mental health on college 
campuses is a critical issue. 
A 
2016-17 
report 
from 
Healthy Minds, a national 
network that surveys the 
mental health of U.S. college 
students, shows 31 percent 
of students have depression, 
31 
percent 
have 
elevated 
levels of generalized anxiety 
and 11 percent have had 
suicidal ideation in the past 
year. Suicide is the second 
leading killer of Americans 
ages 10-34. These alarming 
statistics highlight the need 
for comprehensive mental 
health services on college 
campuses.
We 
applaud 
CAPS 
and 
other campus organizations 
for attempting to bring more 
awareness to the available 
mental health resources for 
students. One resource we 
would particularly like to see 
this joint campaign promote 
is the embedded counselor 
program run through CAPS. 
While many students may 
not be aware of it, 13 U-M 
units, such as the College of 
Engineering, the School of 
Public Health and the Ford 
School of Public Policy, have 
their own dedicated mental 
health provider available to 

students. These embedded 
counselors have their offices 
not in the main CAPS space 
but in the academic unit 
itself. For instance, a Public 
Policy 
student 
would 
be 
able to see their embedded 
counselor at their office in 
Weill Hall. The embedded 
model was actually started 
in four of the North Campus 
colleges in 2014 and we feel 

that, despite the general 
lack of awareness among 
students, this is a good 
model. CAPS would do well 
to highlight their embedded 
counselors and expand the 
program to other academic 
units such as LSA, which 
does not currently have its 
own.
CAPS 
has 
developed 
a 
bad reputation among some 
University 
students 
due 
to long wait times and the 
feeling that students are 
not getting the help they 
need. While we hear these 
concerns and will continue 
to urge CAPS to cut down 
wait times, we also must 
acknowledge CAPS is meant 
to serve as a first-step on the 
road to good mental health 
and not the cure-all some 
students may expect it to be.
While we endorse this 
new awareness campaign, 

we also call on CAPS to 
improve 
their 
services. 
As 
previously 
mentioned, 
long waits are a serious 
barrier to students wishing 
to 
access 
care. 
We 
also 
have concerns with stories 
of students feeling forced 
away from CAPS and toward 
community providers. While 
we recognize CAPS operates 
under a short-term treatment 
model and it may not be able 
to provide the specialized 
care needed to address some 
mental health problems such 
as eating disorders, pushing 
students toward community 
providers presents problems 
of 
access. 
Unlike 
CAPS, 
community 
providers 
can 
be 
prohibitively 
expensive 
without 
good 
health insurance and many 
students without a car could 
have a hard time traveling to 
appointments.
We encourage CAPS to 
explore innovative solutions 
to improve access to mental 
health 
services 
among 
the 
student 
population. 
Potential 
options 
could 
include a fully staffed CAPS 
office 
on 
North 
Campus 
and providing teletherapy 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
in-person counseling. The 
joint campaign should also 
promote Wolverine Wellness 
and the Wolverine Support 
Network, 
two 
non-CAPS 
mental health interventions. 
 
The 
joint 
awareness 
campaign 
initiated 
by 
three of the University’s 
counseling offices is a step in 
the right direction. However, 
promoting 
resources 
without actively working to 
improve them would be a 
wasted opportunity.

TV NOTEBOOK

“‘Hannah Versus the Tree’ is 

unlike anything I have ever read 
— James Wood,” reads the sole 
endorsement quote on the front 
cover of Leland de la Durantaye’s 
debut novel.

“Hannah Versus the Tree” 

is indeed unique. The main 
character is Hannah Syrls, a young 
woman who opposes the brutality 
that has made her family rich. The 
unnamed male narrator speaks in 
the second person, addressing an 
also unnamed matriarch.

The world of the novel is 

immediately presented as different 
than our own, though it’s never 
clear if that difference is a result of 
the narrator’s skewed perspective 
or if “Hannah Versus the Tree” is 
meant to be science fiction. The 
language 
seems 
intentionally 

vague, but this authorial choice is 
confusing rather than poetic.

“Before the Divide, our world 

heated up. It was like a return to 
the beginning, to the first circle 
of warmth,” the narrator said 
as he describes the first time he 
met Hannah, his friend and later 
lover. What is “the first circle of 
warmth?” This is a question the 
novel poses but does not answer 
in any comprehensible way. Even 
in the book’s first chapter, the 
layers of distance between the 
narrator and the events he is 
describing (which take place in 
some unknown years prior to the 
telling and which he is describing 
to some unknown person) create a 
chasm between the reader and the 
created world of the text.

The narrator and Hannah are 

schooled in myths and theology 
by “the Old One” and “the Wise 
One,” and the beginning of the 
novel is flooded with references 
to literature and culture that 

attempt to situate Hannah’s story 
in the history of epic poetry. 
Instead, the citations read as 
awkward 
and 
forced. 
These 

scenes remind me of Donna Tartt’s 
“The Secret History,” in which a 
group of college students commit 
themselves to the study of ancient 
Greece. However, de la Durantaye 
never manages to create the same 
sense of mythic intensity that 
Tartt develops. This issue of failed 
profundity plagues the rest of the 
“Hannah Versus the Tree” as well.

“‘Hannah Versus the Tree’ 

presents a new literary genre, the 
mythopoetic thriller,” announces 
the inside flap of the book 
jacket. What an odd, bold claim, 
considering that mythopoeia is 
nothing new at all and that many 
works in the genre are certainly 
thrillers. Here lies the essential 
problem with “Hannah Versus 
the Tree”: de la Durantaye has 
disassembled and obscured plot, 
characterization 
and 
language 

to create a work he believes is 
original.

If the book had any semblance 

of subversion or intrigue, this 
could be a successful trade-off. 
Unfortunately, the trite and tired 
character archetypes — manic 
pixie dream girl, wise grandparent, 
feisty protagonist — do not infuse 
the dull, impenetrable plot with 
any sense of humanity. The 
language is labyrinthine, and the 
reliance on cliché detracts from 
any moments of clarity.

In a final, desperate plea to attach 

universal importance to the novel, 
de la Durantaye inadvertently 
hammers the last nail into the 
book’s coffin. At the midpoint of 
the text, Hannah is raped by her 
uncle after she opposes his plan 
for the environmental devastation 
of the Amazon. The scene is 
described in uncomfortable detail 
that masquerades as insight. “As he 
came closer his eyes changed and 
he grew enchanted by the pain, 
causing more so as to see more 
power to cause it,” the narrator 
said. This sentence — like many in 
“Hannah Versus the Tree” — is so 
tortured as to be incoherent, and 
the effect is a bizarre, ill-defined 
fetishizing of pain and power.

After the rape, Hannah is 

immediately overcome with the 
desire for revenge: “As he walked 
out, replacing the key, he said, 
‘If you even whisper of this I’ll 

do worse.’ And she whispered 
back that he was wrong.” By 
eliminating any nuance from this 
scene, de la Durantaye indulges 
in the unimaginative trope of a 
woman whose motivations can all 
be traced back to a man and the 
act of violence he has committed 
against her.

Why do men love writing 

about sexual assault? Hannah’s 

rape is the catalyst for every one 
of her subsequent actions, the 
single defining event of her life 
that drives her ravenous desire 
for revenge against her family. 
I could have overlooked all the 
other problems with this book if 
it were not for de la Durantaye’s 
callous use of assault as a means of 
articulating his misguided notions 
about victimhood and violence. 
Rape is not a plot device, and its 
use as such in “Hannah Versus 
the Tree” is the most egregious 
example of de la Durantaye’s 
lacking imagination. 

The whole book feels like a weak 

gesture at some undefined avant-
garde ideal. It seeks to interrogate 
power, beauty, knowledge and 
capitalism, but it is missing the 
gravitas and compassion that could 
have elevated the novel beyond 
its structural weaknesses. By 
exchanging complexity of emotion 
for the complexity of construction, 
the 
novel 
deteriorates 
into 

formulaic banalities about the very 
subjects de la Durantaye set out to 
complicate. Simply put, “Hannah 
Versus the Tree” takes itself far 
too seriously.

‘Hannah Versus the Tree’ 
a poor attempt at depth

MIRIAM FRANCISCO

Daily Arts Writer

To attain a firm grasp on 

what in the actual fuck the 
digital programming platform 
Brat is, we need to discuss 
the 
nuance 
between 
the 

young people that comprise 
Generation Z. Generation Z 
encompasses 
anyone 
born 

between 1997 and 2009, but as 
anyone born between 1997 and 
2009 will tell you, this is not 
the full truth. As a result of the 
dawn of the smartphone and 
easier internet accessibility, 
our generation is in many ways 
fragmented by way of extreme 
differences 
in 
childhoods. 

Generation Z is comprised of 
two distinct sectors: those 
who 
watched 
their 
chaste 

crushes on Nick Jonas evolve 
into sexually charged feelings 
towards 
Harry 
Styles 
and 

those 
who 
(unironically) 

crush on Noah Centineo and 
Jacob Sartorius. Some of us 
remember big drama unfolding 
on G-chat, while others can 
only recall Snapchat. Most 
importantly, while some of us 
were raised on a television diet 
consisting of Cartoon Network, 
Nickelodeon 
and 
Disney 

Channel 
with 
occasional 

sprinkles of YouTube for clips 
or music, the younger sector’s 
entertainment 
is 
almost 

completely based on YouTube. 
Nowhere else is this difference 
between us as apparent than 
on the Brat network.

For those not cool enough 

to be in the know about 
the 
hottest 
children’s 

programming, Brat is a new 
digital network created by 
app developer Rob Fishman, 
with content that is targeted 
at the eight- to 13-year-old 
demographic. 
Armed 
with 

$40 million from investors, 
Fishman’s goal with Brat was 
to steer YouTube away from 
the monotony of vlog content 
and 
short-form 
Vine 
style 

comedy and transform it into 
a 
legitimate 
platform 
that 

not only offers the former, 
but also can serve as a real 
competitor to television. In 
his pursuit of the ubiquity of 
networks like Disney Channel 
and 
Nickelodeon, 
Fishman 

has decided to tamper with 
the formula in some ways to 
great success. Banking on the 
community of the Internet 
that 
largely 
defines 
the 

younger sector of Generation 
Z, 
Fishman 
has 
shrewdly 

taken a shortcut; rather than 
awaiting a team of executives 
to 
discover 
and 
mold 
an 

unknown, Brat is hiring viral 
teen sensations.

By bringing aboard and 

crafting 
vehicles 
around 

tweens 
who 
have 
already 

amassed 
a 
huge 
following 

on apps like Tik Tok (R.I.P. 
Musical.ly), the only thing 
needed to promote the shows 
are the names of the mini-
celebrities. Shows on Brat 
are billed as “Annie” and 
“Hayden” in “Chicken Girls” 
or “Kehlani” and “Taylor” 
in “Dirt.” To put their fame 
in perspective, all of them 
are apparently big enough to 
their respective fanbases to 
be recognized as mononyms. 
Whereas in the past, the 
project 
(a 
“High 
School 

Musical,” for example) would 

do the job of promoting then-
unknown actors, on Brat the 
reverse is true. If a show needs 
to land, they will shove in 
someone that they know their 
preteen masses will love. It 
almost sounds too easy, yet the 
system is clearly working — a 
little over a year after its initial 
launch, Brat is surpassing its 
creator’s expectations, with 
at least 10 individual shows 
being cranked out so fast that 
some are already in their third 
season, and are averaging at 
least three million views per 
episode.

Fishman and company also 

take advantage of the lack 
of 
sophistication 
of 
Brat’s 

primary audience. For someone 

who is reportedly backed by 
investors with $40 million 
to craft an online network 
from scratch, the quality of 
the product should not look 
as pathetic as it does. The 
sets look laughably fake. Not 
one person on Brat’s payroll 
can act. The central stars, the 
tertiary characters and even 
the adults act as though they 
have 
never 
processed 
the 

English language before. Even 
more hilariously, there is little 
consideration given to casting 
characters who look their age 
that it took me an entire season 
of “Chicken Girls” to decipher 
which grade the characters 
were in. However, the joke is 
not on Fishman for producing 
lackluster content. At the end 
of the day, he is still profiting 
immensely. Brat is not trying 
to boast the newest crop of 
teenage 
acting 
phenomena, 

and they’re not apologizing 
for not doing so. Brat is all 
gimmicks, no talent.

The gimmicks have only 

become more evident in Brat’s 
quest to outdo Disney — to do 
what Disney has never been 
able to do. Even in its inaugural 
year, 
Brat 
has 
undergone 

rapid image reconstruction to 
shed its innocent children’s 
television persona and tackle 
melodrama. Nowhere is this 
shift as clear as on its flagship 
show, 
“Chicken 
Girls.” 
In 

season one of the show (aired 

in Sept. 2017), the central 
drama was wholesome, clean 
fun — drama between two 
middle school dance teams, 
characters being too afraid 
to kiss boys and hanging out 
in the neighborhood arcade. 
Season 
three 
(currently 

airing) has taken a drastically 
different 
approach. 
Nine 

episodes into season three 
and I have already witnessed 
plotlines related to underage 
tattoos, 
school 
vandalism, 

open mouth kisses with boys 
at parties, peer pressure from 
older girls, frank discussions 
of sexuality, infidelity and 
using boys as pawns to gain 
popularity. Someone get me 
my church fan.

In addition to these drastic 

changes within one series, 
Brat has also seen its cleaner 
content 
like 
“BroBot” 
and 

“Overnights” canceled in favor 
of “Dirt,” a new series that is 
so dangerous that, without 
a doubt, millions of pre-teen 
girls across America will be 
sneaking to watch it after 
their parents have gone to 
sleep. Kids are poppin’ pills 
(granted, it’s Ibuprofen) on 
“Dirt.” 
If 
anything, 
Brat’s 

rapid rebranding indicates a 
mastery of PR, but on a more 
haunting level, a knowledge 
of how to straddle the line 
between innocence and adult 
content all for the sake of 
views and profit.

So what does the boom 

in YouTube celebrity mean 
for the fate of old standards 
like 
Disney 
Channel 
and 

Nickelodeon? While the two 
still retain the upper hand 
in terms of recognizability, 
this recognizability can act 
as a double-edged sword — 
because 
the 
powerhouses 

have been operating under 
the 
same 
system, 
wherein 

being risqué has always been 
a hard “no,” if they were to 
abruptly shift their image it 
would come across as solely 
opportunistic 
and 
soulless. 

With Dan Schneider’s ousting 
at Nickelodeon (among murky 
accusations) 
and 
Disney’s 

failure to produce stars of the 
magnitude of the golden era 
of Miley, Selena and Demi, 
it seems that Brat is the only 
network that is daring to do 
something — granted, icky 
— different from the typical 
formula of television targeted 
pre-teens.

Brat seems to be one step 

ahead of Disney and Nick in all 
respects. Brat also has actor/
singers akin to the storied 
traditions of Disney and Nick, 
but 
they 
are 
strategically 

advertising their own station 
on Spotify during their shows. 
Disney and Nick may have 
episodes posted on YouTube, 
but while they cost money to 
view, every episode of every 
series on Brat is free. Brat also 
has an acute understanding of 
playing up the popular “ships” 
of characters on their series, 
in order for the subsequent 
frenzy to lead to more views 
and more interaction with 
their content. Brat and its 
shows may appear to be a joke 
to you and me — a 20-year-old 
woman who chooses to spend 
free time ridiculing children’s 
television — but it would be 
foolish to underestimate the 
seismic shift in television we 
are bearing witness to.

BOOK REVIEW

“Hannah Versus 

the Tree”

Durantaye

McSweeney’s

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘NOWHERE2GO’

FLICKR

Almost exactly a month after 

Earl 
Sweatshirt 
released 
his 

second studio album I Don’t Like 
Shit, I Don’t Go Outside, “solace,” 
a 10-minute extended single, 
emerged 
from 
Sweatshirt’s 

unofficial 
YouTube 
channel. 

Captioned with a vague, “Music 
for when I hit the bottom and 
found 
something,” 
it’s 
about 

as introspective as one can 
imagine. In between dissonant 
instrumental 
interludes 
and 

softly gliding synths, Sweatshirt 
raps 
about 
past 
addictions, 

loneliness and his grandma. It’s 
subject material that has been 
used in most of his past projects, 
from Doris to I Don’t Like Shit, 
yet, differing from both of these, 
“solace” 
presents 
something 

softer, a little more hopeful. “And 
I buy nothin’ by myself, my second 
thoughts, my sec,” he mumbles 
in the fourth section, stumbling 
into silence, before picking back 
up with, “My hands, I start to 
cry when I see them / Cause they 
remind me of seein’ her / These 
the times when I need her the 

most cause I feel defeated.” On 
their own, the verses drag with 
a melancholic weight, yet the 
piano in background is open and 

gentle; in complete emptiness, 
there is always solace to be found, 
he seems to be saying. When 
rock bottom has been hit, there is 
nowhere to go but up.

This 
past 
week, 
Earl 

Sweatshirt, after three years of 
nearly complete silence, dropped 
“Nowhere2Go.” When I listened 
to it for the first time — and nearly 
every other time after that — I was 
inexplicably reminded of “solace.” 
Lyrically, 
“Nowhere2Go” 
isn’t 

as darkly intimate: “I found a 
new way to cope / It ain’t no 
slave to my soul / But I keep the 
memories close by,” he raps in 
a steady march. Yet, both songs 
share a similar vulnerability, 

the looping drum melody of 
“Nowhere2Go” inducing the same 
effect as “solace”’s wandering lo-fi 
ambiance — a subtle optimism 
that was rarely seen amid the 
bleakness of I Don’t Like Shit or 
Doris’s chaotic whorl.

“Nowhere2Go” isn’t a single 

in the traditional sense. Rather, it 
seems to serve as an introduction 
of what’s to come, a snippet of a 
new sound that Sweatshirt has 
been toying with since “solace.” 
After all, you can barely hear 
Sweatshirt 
deliver 
his 
bars 

underneath 
“Nowhere2Go”’s 

heavy production, and this seems 
to 
be 
intentional. 
Languidly, 

he 
throws 
out 
monorhymes 

alongside more complex rhythms, 
and both are allowed to surface 
organically, free-flowing from the 
clutter. The result is something 
drowsily thoughtful: ideas that 
Earl Sweatshirt’s been mulling 
over in his head for a while but has 
only just now found out how to put 
into words.

This past weekend, my friend 

and I went to see “Candide.” 
After the show, we couldn’t stop 
talking about the controversial 
and 
potentially 
offensive 

nature of some of the jokes. For 
those unfamiliar with the show, 
much of the humor revolves 
around seemingly impossible 
sequences of negative events 
befalling various characters. 
My friend was particularly 
struck by a long sequence in 
which the audience laughs 
as Cunegonde recalls being 
stabbed, repeatedly raped, left 
to die and then almost buried 
alive — the humor comes in 
that she somehow escapes from 
this sequence of events entirely 
unchanged.

This conversation got me 

thinking about other examples 
of 
over-the-top, 
offensive 

humor. I’m a huge fan of “The 
Book of Mormon,” for example, 
and it has many examples of 
this. One example that comes to 
mind is a character interrupting 
happy 
moments 
throughout 

the play by repeatedly singing 
“I still have maggots in my 
scrotum.” 
Another 
example 

is the song “Sal Tlay Ka 
Siti,” in which the audience 
invariably laughs at an African 
character’s misconception of 
American society. Statements 
such as “I’ll bet the goat-meat 
there is plentiful / And they 
have vitamin injections by the 
case,” or “The war-lords there 
are friendly… And there’s a 
Red Cross on every corner 
/ With all the flour you can 
eat,” are always greeted with 
laughter despite their potential 
offensive nature.

What makes this humor 

acceptable 
in 
a 
society 

becoming 
increasingly 

cognizant 
of 
unconscious 

biases 
and 
offensive 

stereotypes? As my friend said, 
why were these statements 
acceptably humorous in context 
though they would obviously 
have been offensive out of 
context? Could my laughing 
at these statements be seen as 
condoning these stereotypes? 
Does my laughter minimize 
our collective awareness of the 
harm of these stereotypes?

Initially, I will admit, the 

distinction between agreeing 
with 
these 
stereotypes 

and finding humor in them 
seemed insignificant. In both 
instances, 
I 
thought, 
not 

challenging these stereotypes 
ingrains them. This distinction 
seemed superficial — beneath 
this 
façade 
of 
laughter 

or 
tacit 
acceptance 
lies 
a 

negative stereotype that gives 
the 
statement 
context 
and 

meaning. Unless we call out 
these statements, are we not 
allowing them to spread under 
the surface?

With more analysis, however, 

the 
distinction 
between 

laughter and agreement could 
not be clearer. While laughing 
at these jokes out of context is 
indeed offensive, laughing at 
them in context is the opposite 
of 
offensive. 
Laughing 
in 

context indicates that we are 
aware of the offensive tropes 

or discriminatory assumptions 
that allow for this humor.

Humor, after all, is the 

juxtaposition of two illogical 
or 
contradictory 
concepts. 

We laugh because we witness 
something 
unexpected, 

illogical or otherwise atypical. 
We laugh because we are 
aware of the contradiction that 
makes a statement humorous 
and not simply meaningful. 
Laughing at jokes such as those 
described above indicate that 
we understand the stereotype 

that makes them humorous.

In “Candide,” for example, 

the audience laughs at the 
long list of negative events 
because it clashes both with 
the unrealistic positivity that 
we expect of an operetta and 
the amount of unluckiness that 
we think could ever befall one 
person. Rather than condoning 
or tacitly accepting this long 
chain of negative events, we 
laugh specifically because we 
know them to be improbable, if 
not impossible. Humor proves 
that we have analyzed the play 
on multiple levels and focused 
in on a glaring contradiction 
between what we think is 
possible and what the play has 
told us is possible.

In “The Book of Mormon,” 

the 
complexity 
of 
African 

society 
contradicts 
the 

stereotypes 
of 
“developing 

country” simplicity pervasive 
throughout American culture. 
The 
seemingly 
absurd 

statements in “Sal Tlay Ka 
Siti” are thus humorous in 
that they demonstrate to us 
the inherent impossibility of 
these 
stereotypes. 
Through 

the 
singer’s 
confused 

understanding 
of 
American 

society, 
we 
begin 
to 
see 

how flawed our conception 
of African society is. The 
play holds a mirror to our 
unconscious biases, reflecting 
them back on us in the form 
of a glaringly stereotypical 
representation 
of 
Africans 

dreaming of American society.

This 
concept 
of 
humor 

relates to my understanding 
of art and my views on what 
constitutes “good” art. I view 
good art as art that makes 
us question our beliefs and 
reassess 
our 
unconscious 

biases. It touches us on an 
emotional 
level, 
bypassing 

the intellect and provoking 
new lines of thought. It is 
emotionally complex, allowing 
for endless interpretation, and 
it 
communicates 
something 

about the human condition 
that transcends the limitations 

of any specific time period or 
culture.

Good humor, I realized, does 

much the same thing. Humor 
trains the mind to be skeptical, 
to question information against 
our 
expectations 
and 
find 

statements so illogical as to 
be humorous. And while this 
humor can be based on offensive 
statements, the effect of this 
offensive humor is actually 
the opposite of offensive, as it 
forces us to become conscious 
of the stereotypes and biases 
that 
make 
the 
statement 

humorous. Unless we are aware 
of an underlying stereotype, we 
cannot find a statement to be 
funny.

Humor can even be effective 

in fighting white nationalism. 
In an article in The New York 
Times last year, for example, 
Tina 
Rosenberg 
describes 

an 
unconventional 
and 

surprisingly effective means 
of fighting neo-Nazism. After 
years 
of 
staging 
counter-

protests at neo-Nazi events to 
little success, some American 
towns have begun humorously 
mocking event participants. 
Groups such as the “Coup Clutz 
Clowns” greet white nationalist 
protesters with confetti and 
shouts of “white flour” (an 
intentional misunderstanding 
of cries of “white power”). 

White nationalists feed off 

the victimization and the need 
for hyper-masculine aggression 
that serious counter-protests 
provoke. 
Counter-protesting 

with humor deprives these 
white 
nationalists 
of 
the 

attention, fear and power they 
seek. 
Though 
some 
would 

argue that reacting to these 
events with humor willfully 
ignores the severity of the 
threat that they pose, this 
humor proves to be incredibly 
effective in depriving those in 
the movement of the hyper-
masculine validation they seek.

Humor is thus an incredibly 

effective tool not for building 
up 
ideas 
but 
for 
tearing 

down opposing ideas. Humor 
forces 
us 
to 
be 
skeptical, 

to 
accept 
nothing 
at 
face 

value; humor brings even the 
most ingrained unconscious 

biases to the realm of the 

conscious 
and 
intentional. 

When used well, it exposes 
contradiction without allowing 
for a counterargument. And 
though it can be offensive 
on 
the 
surface, 
humor 

predicated on an inoffensive 
and unprejudiced worldview 
is 
ultimately 
anything 
but 

offensive. It functions much 
as my understanding of good 
art functions, provoking an 
immediate emotional reaction 
that lays the groundwork for 
lengthy, complex thought on 
the ambiguities of the human 
condition.

And if this whole column 

can be generated from one 
potentially offensive joke in 
an operetta, imagine what can 
be generated from a series of 
jokes! The possibilities abound 
for 
those 
willing 
to 
take 

this Matrix-esque red pill of 
skepticism.

Offensive humor and

Susan Orlean at the Ann 
Arbor District Library

At some point in our lives, 

we will allow ourselves to 
be consumed by something, 
kindled by the flames of art, 
sex, passion or whatever else 
transcends you beyond the 
mortal realm of existence. 
If we weren’t curious about 
something 
or 
hungry 
for 

knowledge, we would be left 
on empty, our own flames 
extinguished.

Susan Orlean, a journalist for 

The New Yorker and acclaimed 
author of “The Orchid Thief” 
(the basis for Oscar-winning, 
Meryl Streep-starring 2002 
film “Adaptation”), had her 
own fascination sparked by 
the Los Angeles library fire of 
1986. The flames that devoured 
over 400,000 library books 
was a travesty to page after 
page of history, memories and 
untainted knowledge. Beyond 
the content inside, the library 
building itself was a mecca for 
connection among people and 

words that left patrons with a 
reviving sense of community 
and ineffable nostalgia.

Last Thursday night in the 

Ann Arbor District Library, 
aisles were filled with admirers 
of 
Orlean’s 
endearment 

towards library books and 
the worlds they hold inside. 
Orlean’s curiosity surrounding 
this tragic event prompted her 
latest release, “The Library 
Book,” a biography that peers 
into why libraries and library 
books are cherished as sacred 
spaces across the globe. 

TESSA ROSE
Daily Arts Writer

BOOKS EVENT

Orlean’s 
work 
consisted 

of investigating the arrest 
of the young man possessed 
by his dream of stardom and 
the 
subsequent 
legal 
case 

surrounding his arson. The 
results were in: 45,000 works 
of literature, 9,000 business 
books, 
6,000 
magazines, 

18,000 social science books, 
12,000 cookbooks (including 
six 
books 
of 
popcorn 

recipes) and numerous other 
devastated 
book 
categories 

making the recovery attempt 
the largest on record. All of 
the books were wet from the 
firefighters’s attempt to put 
out the flames. The only way 
to salvage some more time for 
the books to have a chance at 
restoration was for them to be 
frozen. The library reached 
out to various food companies 
in L.A. that had freezers large 
enough to store hundreds of 
thousands of damaged library 
books. “They shoved aside the 
broccoli and the shrimp. And 
the books were frozen for 6 
years,” Orlean said.

While writing “The Library 

Book,” Orlean’s mother was 
diagnosed with dementia.

“I came across an expression 

that is used in Senegal when 
someone dies, and rather than 
saying that he or she died, 
you say his or her library has 
burned,” Orlean said. As Orlean 
watched her own mother’s 
library burn down, she finally 
recognized the power libraries 
have to retain things eternally 

while humans fade closer to 
oblivion with each passing 
inhale and exhale.

“Each of us in a sense as 

our own private library, our 
own set of volumes of stories 
and vignettes. Libraries in a 

way replicate what we have 
inside ourselves, a collection 
of information that defines 
who we are, who we’ve been 
and who we dream of being,” 
Orlean said.

There’s 
a 
reason 
that 

burning 
books 
seems 
like 

a 
heinous 
crime 
against 

humanity, and to Orlean, it is 
because books preserve who 
we are. For this same reason, 
oppressive regimes burn books 
as a method of terror against 
other nations, sending the 
message that “you don’t exist.” 
“The number of books burned 
in World War II and libraries 
burned is the single greatest 
loss of books in the history of 
civilization,” Orlean stated. 
Books 
become 
extensions 

of 
ourselves 
that 
preserve 

culture, history, science and 
all other bits and pieces of 
human thought rendered into 
ink-inscribed words on paper.

Orlean concluded the event 

with a reading from the end of 
“The Library Book” that best 
captures the sentimentality 
of libraries: “The library is 
so big that I can feel private. 
Almost like a secret place,” she 
said. The idea, it seemed, was 
that libraries connect people 
with ideas, cultivating spaces 
for the embers of passion and 
inspiration to be set ablaze.

“The 
silence 
was 
more 

soothing than solemn. The 
library is a good place to sulk 
in solitude. A place where you 
feel part of a conversation that 
has gone on for hundreds and 
hundreds of years even when 
you’re all alone... You don’t 
need to take a book off of a 
shelf to know there is a voice 
inside that is waiting to speak 
to you.”

Brown calls Rutgers play “wake-up” call

It’s hard to find lapses in 
the Michigan football team’s 
defense.
Over the last few weeks, the 
fourth-ranked Wolverines have 
dominated on every side of the 
ball, but especially when the 
opponent has the ball. They have 
given up just 34 points in the last 
four games and have the No. 1 
total defense in the country.
So when Michigan traveled to 
Piscataway to take on Rutgers, 
the Big Ten’s perennial bottom-
feeder, it was expected to 
be a blowout the whole way, 
with the Wolverines’ defense 
smothering the worst offense in 
the conference.
For the most part, that was 
what happened. If it weren’t for 
an 80-yard touchdown run from 
running back Isiah Pacheco, 
the Scarlet Knights would have 
been held scoreless with fewer 
than 200 yards.
“Well 
thought-out 
play,” 

said defensive coordinator Don 
Brown on the play. “They lined 
up three backs in the backfield, 
they motioned one of them out, 
we made the adjustment nicely. 
They brought that guy back and 
faked the reverse with him and 
we lost one of our edges and the 
safety who had him man-to-
man was adjusting to him. But 
we lost the edge to the defense — 
the back edge — and it got out.”
Of course, in the grand 
scheme of things, the play 
doesn’t really matter. But it 
can serve some purpose for a 
defense that has done nearly all 
that is asked of it.
For one, Michigan is still 
chasing its first shutout of the 
season. In fact, it hasn’t shut a 
team out in two seasons — the 
last coming in 2016 against 
Rutgers.
That was a focus when the 
Wolverines faced Penn State 
two weeks ago, as they now-
famously wanted revenge for 
the Nittany Lions’ beatdown 
over them in 2017. But Michigan 

couldn’t 
get 
it 
done 
then 
thanks to a late, garbage-time 
touchdown.
And on Saturday against the 
Scarlet Knights, the Wolverines 
once again fell just short of the 
shutout, thanks to Pacheco’s 
run.
The second way the play 
serves a purpose is as a bit of a 
wake-up call.
Before 
Michigan 
played 
Rutgers, the Wolverines played, 
and beat, three-straight ranked 
teams. The Scarlet Knights, 
along with Indiana this week, 
make this part of the schedule 
inarguably easier than what 
Michigan just endured.
Perhaps 
because 
of 
that, 
Brown said his team needed a 
wake-up call last Wednesday, 
so he yelled at them a little bit. 
Pacheco’s run had a similar 
effect.
“That was a wake-up call for 
me,” Brown said.
With a defense this good, 
that’s about the only call they 
need.

Warriner says ‘M’ exceeds expectations

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Defensive coordinator Don Brown says Rutgers’ touchdown tun was a “wake-up” call for him.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Offensive line coach Ed Warriner has taken over and helped Michigan’s offensive line steadily improve.

When the Michigan football 
team hired Ed Warriner as 
an 
offensive 
analyst 
last 
offseason, it was unclear what 
his immediate role would be.
Warriner had always been 
an offensive line coach at 
Division I programs across the 
country, but the Wolverines 
already 
had 
an 
offensive 
line 
coach 
and 
run-game 
coordinator in Tim Drevno.
But Drevno left the program 
for Southern California, and 
Warriner was promoted to 
take his place.
“I wanted to be a part of this 
program, and I knew that I 
would contribute in whatever 
role I had,” Warriner said. 
“And then it came to be, 
probably a few weeks after I 
got here, and so there was no 
promises or anything like that 
going into it. So I just came 
here to be a guy to help in any 
way, shape or form.
“Then 
when 
the 

opportunity presented itself 
and (coach Jim Harbaugh) 
said, ‘You’ve got the line,’ of 
course I was ecstatic about 
that.”
In hindsight, that move may 
have made all the difference 
for Michigan’s offense.
The offensive line, which 
was under fire all of last 
season, has improved as this 
season has gone on. It’s to 
the point now where that unit 
may be one of the Wolverines’ 
strengths.
That was unthinkable in 
years past.
“I’m really pleased at where 
they’re at,” Warriner said 
Wednesday. “So we’re headed 
in the right direction. We 
keep getting better and better. 
I think we’ve grown a lot. I 
still think there’s some room 
to squeeze a little more juice 
out of it, and we’re gonna try 
to do that.”
The growth of his position 
group may have shaped how 
Warriner 
feels 
about 
his 
experience in general.

He said he expected big 
things when he came from 
Ann Arbor — stemming from 
the beginning of his career 
when he was at West Point 
coaching Army and much of 
the staff there had previously 
been at Michigan.
Even with that, Warriner 
says being a part of the 
Wolverines’ 
program 
has 
exceeded expectations.
“Michigan is what I thought 
it would be — the University, 
the 
athletic 
department, 
what (athletic director Warde 
Manuel has) got going here, 
what (coach Jim Harbaugh 
has) got going here,” Warriner 
said.
“But for me, it’s been better, 
but it was all gonna be about 
how much could I impact 
the group I had, and could 
they get them where they 
could help this team play at a 
championship level? So that’s 
been very fulfilling. But my 
expectation was this is a place 
that’s as good as it gets, and it 
is as good as it gets.”

Garrett Van Wyhe, fourth line looking to add secondary scoring threat

From his first game in a 
Michigan 
hockey 
sweater, 
Garrett Van Wyhe made an 
impact.
In the Wolverines’ season 
opener 
against 
Vermont, 
Van 
Wyhe 
witnessed 
the 
Catamounts 
hit 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 
from behind multiple times. 
The freshman forward had 
enough of his teammate taking 
unnecessary hits and got in 
the face of the Vermont player, 
seemingly telling him to back 
off Hughes.
For the rest of the game, 
Hughes 
was 
relatively 
unscathed.
“I 
don’t 
like 
taking 
penalties, but sticking up for 
our teammates is one of the 
things that morally, I think 
is all right,” Van Wyhe said 
Wednesday. “I’m not gonna 
just let our team get bullied, 
and I’m gonna make sure that 
everyone knows that I’m gonna 
stick up for my guys. … They’re 
my brothers, so I’ve got their 
backs.”
But outside of standing up 
for his teammates, Van Wyhe 
hasn’t had a huge impact on the 
stat sheet. He has started as the 
fourth-line center in all nine 
games for No. 16 Michigan (5-4 
overall, 1-1 Big Ten), but his 
linemates changed throughout 
the first few weeks, making 
line chemistry — and offensive 
success — more difficult.
In 
the 
last 
couple 
weeks, 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
line 
has 
settled in with 
freshman 
forward 
Nolan 
Moyle 
and 
sophomore 
forward Dakota 
Raabe on the left 
and right wings, 
respectively. 
Van Wyhe, Moyle and Raabe 
have 
found 
some 
chances 
to score since they’ve been 
playing together, but across the 
three of them, Raabe is the only 

one who has found twine.
The first and second lines 
are carrying the Wolverines on 
offense to this point, with 37 
combined points 
— 
compared 
to 
the 
nine 
combined across 
the bottom two 
lines. That’s an 
unsustainable 
recipe across a 
full season.
“We’re 
still 
trying 
to 
find 
some 
scoring 
from 
some different people,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“We’ve got a couple lines that 
are carrying us. We need some 
other guys to kick in here 

and there, and obviously that 
secondary scoring.”
Now that the players seem 
to be locked into positions, it 
could be Van Wyhe, Moyle and 
Raabe that help the Wolverines 
find that secondary scoring 
they’ll need through the rest of 
the season.
In 
the 
2-1 
win 
against 
Notre Dame on Nov. 9, it was 
that fourth line of forwards 
that kept the game moving in 
Michigan’s favor. It seemed that 
nearly every time they were on 
the ice, they were stealing the 
puck from the Fighting Irish or 
putting pressure on goaltender 
Cale Morris.
“They’ve controlled the play 
in the other team’s offensive 
zone when they’ve been out 

there, and that’s what you’re 
looking 
for,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“They’ve been good momentum 
changers, too. There’s been a 
couple times in games we’re 
playing in our zone, we throw 
them out there and they change 
the momentum and they play in 
the other team’s zone, so good 
for them. We’re gonna need 
that.”
Now, it seems, the only 
thing 
left 
for 
Van 
Wyhe, 
Raabe and Moyle is to break 
through on the stat sheet. The 
scoring chances are coming 
more and more frequently, but 
they haven’t found consistent 
success on those chances yet.
With 
Van 
Wyhe 
as 
the 
center of the line, the offense 
is expected to flow through 

him. Pearson said he’s good at 
distributing the puck but added 
that some of his open shots 
have caught him a bit off guard.
“I think he’s 
pretty 
right 
on 
that 
one,” 
Van Wyhe said 
when 
told 
of 
his 
coach’s 
comments. 
“I think I get 
a 
little 
too 
anxious if I find 
myself with a 
little more time 
than I thought 
and kinda just get in my own 
head. Calming down is kinda 
the perfect term for it. Just rely 
on my instincts and be able to 
bury chances.”

When Van Wyhe and the 
rest of his linemates get the 
chemistry they need, they’ll 
be valuable additions to the 
Wolverines’ 
offense. 
And 
the 
chemistry 
has 
improved 
every 
game 
they’ve 
played 
together, so it 
seems to be only 
a matter of time 
before there’s a 
breakthrough.
“They’ve 
got 
the potential to 
score,” Pearson said. “I think 
once they get a little more 
chemistry and once they kick 
in a couple, that dam’s gonna 
break, and look out.”

Philly Special

‘M’ avenges national championship 
loss to Nova with blowout, 73-46 win

VILLANOVA, Pa. — This was 
not supposed to happen.
Last April, Villanova took the 
floor in San Antonio and put on a 
spectacular display of basketball 
dominance. 
The 
Wildcats 
seemingly scored at will, while 
suffocating the Michigan men’s 
basketball team on the other end.
Wednesday night in Villanova, 
history was supposed to repeat 
itself.
And it did — except that the 
roles were reversed, with the 
18th-ranked 
Wolverines 
(3-0 
overall) jumping out to an early 
lead and never looking back in a 
stunning, 73-46 win.
If anything went as expected 
on Wednesday, it 
was 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
dominance. After 
allowing 
just 
13 points in the 
second 
half 
of 
Saturday’s 
win 
over Holy Cross, 
they limited the 
eighth-ranked 
Wildcats (2-1) to 
17 first half points 
on 6-of-25 shooting.
Postgame, Villanova coach 
Jay Wright was asked what went 
wrong for his team. Midway 
through a lengthy self-reflection 
on the Wildcats’ performance, he 
stopped and corrected himself.
“Number one: their defense.”
At half time, Villanova trailed 
in all but two categories — 
personal fouls and turnovers. 
The 
Wildcats 
finished 
with 
two more free throws than the 
Wolverines but the turnover 
disparity 
remained, 
as 
they 
finished with 21 — seven more 
than their made field goal tally.
“We really are gonna probably 
be as good as our defense is 
gonna be this year,” said coach 
John Beilein. “And it was really 
good today.”
“People ask, ‘well what’s this 
scheme or what did you do?’ 
We have really good individual 
defenders, including our big guy 
Jon Teske. They’re really good at 
picking you apart and finding a 
weakness. We didn’t have many 
weaknesses 
individually 
on 
defense today and that was a big 
difference.”
Eight minutes into the first 
half, 
Michigan 
had 
already 

quieted a raucous Villanova 
crowd by building an early 14-8 
lead. That wasn’t enough for 
Beilein, who replaced junior 
center Jon Teske with freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis and 
shifted 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah Livers to the ‘5,’ where 
he would remain until Teske 
returned with 25 seconds left 
in the half. By that point, the 
Wolverines led, 44-17.
Livers 
made 
a 
dramatic 
introduction to his new position, 
pulling up from just beyond the 
3-point arc to hit Michigan’s 
second 
consecutive 
3-pointer 
and start a 25-5 run, but his 
biggest impact came on the 
defensive end.
“(Livers) allows us, with a 
driving big like they have, he 
can 
stay 
in 
front of him,” 
Beilein 
said 
“… 
And 
then, 
hitting 
those 
two 3s in the 
first half really 
was big for us. 
You’ve watched 
our games, you 
know 
right 
now, we were 
struggling 
getting open shots from outside. 
He knocked down those two 3s.
Added Wright: “If they’re 
with (Livers) at 
the ‘five’ and he’s 
the 
biggest 
guy 
and he’s guarding 
our guards, that’s 
a hell of a team.”
But much like 
against 
Holy 
Cross, 
it 
was 
Brazdeikis 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
forward 
Charles 
Matthews leading 
the way for the Wolverines. 
Matthews led all scorers with 19 
points — including 16 in the first 
half.
His most ferocious two came 
with the game teetering on the 
edge of a blowout, as Michigan 
led with 26-13 with 6:29 to 
play in the first half. Livers 
missed a layup under the hoop, 
but Matthews elevated above 
multiple 
Villanova 
would-be 
rebounders to slam home a two-
handed dunk before flexing to 
the crowd.
“I just play and let my passion 
take over,” Matthews said. “It 
was an exciting game, it was a 

fun game and I got the dunk, and 
I just screamed. I didn’t know 
what else to do.”
Livers made amends on the 
next possession with his second 
three of the day. Sophomore 
guard Jordan Poole followed 
up with an isolation three over 
forward 
Jermaine 
Samuels 
before 
Brazdeikis 
completed 
an 
and-one 
to 
extend 
the 
Wolverines’ lead to 24.
If 
the 
Wildcats 
had 
any 
suppositions 
of 
a 
second-
half comeback, 
junior 
guard 
Zavier Simpson 
— 
Michigan’s 
defensive star 
all 
night 
— 
quickly 
put 
those to rest 
with a basket, steal, and fast-
break assist to put the Wolverines 
up 32 within two minutes.
From 
there, 
the 
rest 
of 
the game — much like the 
closing minutes of the national 
championship — was little more 
than a formality. Only this time, 
it was Michigan exhibiting its 
dominance.
“Whatever the final score 
was,” Wright said, “it wasn’t that 
close.”
Safe to say, that is not 
something 
the 
defending 
national 
champions 
were 
planning to say about a 27-point 
defeat.

Stubborn defense fuels Wolverines 
as they hold Wildcats to 46 points

VILLANOVA, 
Pa. 
— 
It 
happened exactly as John Beilein 
expected.
On 
Villanova’s 
second 
possession, senior forward Eric 
Paschall drove the lane, right at 
Ignas Brazdeikis. With Paschall’s 
40-pound 
weight 
advantage 
and three more years of college 
experience, it should have been 
an easy two points. Instead, 
the freshman held his ground, 
absorbed the contact and took the 
charge.
“We thought they’d isolate him 
and go right at him,” Beilein said. 
“And he stuck right in there and 
drew a charge. That was moving 
his feet. Many players come in 
as freshmen, they aren’t ready 
to do that or it wears them out … 
His endurance and his toughness 
today were outstanding.”
It’s hard to point to the defining 
moment of a blowout like the 
27-point 
shellacking 
Michigan 
unleashed 
on 
the 
Wildcats 
Wednesday night. But just 78 
seconds into the game, Brazdeikis 
had set the tone.
The freshman forward from 
Ontario, 
Canada 
joined 
the 
Wolverines with a reputation for 
scoring. A knack for shutdown 
defense doesn’t show up on his 
scouting report.
It did, however, appear on 
Wednesday’s boxscore. Brazdeikis 
stifled Paschall all night, forcing 
him 
into 
an 
uncharacteristic 

3-for-14 shooting night and just 10 
points, and matching the Villanova 
power forward on every one of his 
drives to the basket.
“Iggy’s kind of like a mini pit 
bull,” said redshirt junior forward 
Charles Matthews. “He’s not 
scared of anything. He took the 
challenge, played against a good 
four-man. He came out there, just 
played hard, played smart and 
tried the best he can.”
With Michigan boasting elite 
defenders such as Matthews junior 
guard Zavier Simpson and junior 
center Jon Teske, it makes sense 
why the Wildcats tried to attack 
Brazdeikis, sensing a relative soft 
spot in the nation’s third most 
efficient defense. It didn’t work — 
and neither did anything else.
“They’re really good at picking 
you apart and finding a weakness,” 
Beilein said. “We didn’t have 
many weaknesses individually on 
defense today.”
Meanwhile, the pre-perceived 
strengths 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
remained 
strengths. 
Simpson — the fiery, hard-nosed 
leader of the unit — racked up 
a whopping six steals while 
relentlessly hounding point guard 
Collin Gillespie into five turnovers 
to 
just 
three 
assists, 
which 
prevented Villanova from finding 
any rhythm offensively.
“He’s just such a tough kid 
and he’s tough to get off the floor, 
sometimes I have to drag him off 
the floor,” Beilein said. “... (His 
teammates) look at him and they 
see leadership all over him.”

Added Villanova coach Jay 
Wright: “Every time (Gillespie) 
caught it, they were in on him. 
That’s why he was driving so 
much, and when he was driving 
they were just banging the hell out 
of him, not letting him go by them.”
Matthews, 
meanwhile, 
matched up with shooting guard 
Phil Booth, who came into the 
contest averaging 20 points per 
game. All night long, Matthews’ 
range and athleticism thwarted 
the Wildcats’ normally lethal 
perimeter attack, closing out hard 
on 3-point shots, recording two 
blocked shots and holding Booth 
to nine points on 2-for-8 shooting.
Beilein noted that Villanova 
shot 
just 
15 
3-pointers 
on 
Wednesday — less than half of its 
season average, and an essential 
ingredient in Michigan’s victory. 
Matthews’ length and athleticism 
were huge reasons why.
“He’s just active. His defense 
is what’s making us right now,” 
Beilein said. “Booth is a heck of 
a player. A heck of a player. So 
Charles is relentless when you give 
him a matchup like that.”
The Wildcats had no more 
luck dealing with the Wolverines’ 
big men, either. Teske is known 
for his prowess in the paint, but 
Wednesday showcased a different 
side of his game. Michigan often 
defended Villanova’s ball screens 
by switching Teske onto the ball 
handler, and the 7-foot-1 giant 
proved he was no statue.
“Most teams, if you switch a 
ball-screen, they’re not gonna get 
more complicated after,” Beilein 
said. “So Jon can do that. Jon can 
really move his feet, and that was 
very obvious today.”
Last 
season, 
the 
Wildcats 
possessed 
the 
second-most 
efficient offense in the KenPom 
era. On Wednesday, Villanova 
scored just 46 points total. It shot 
31.8 percent from the field and 20 
percent from behind the 3-point 
line. It had more turnovers (21) 
than made field goals (14).
And for Michigan, it was the 
entire team — Simpson all the 
way down to the unheralded 
Brazdeikis — that made such a 
performance possible.
“Their 
defense 
was 
very 
physical, very aggressive, and 
really locked in to their scouting 
report,” Wright said. “... They’re 
playing with Brazdeikis at the ‘5’, 
and he’s the biggest guy and he’s 
guarding our guards.
“That’s a hell of a team.”

“We really are 
gonna probably 
be as good as 
our defense.”

“Whatever the 
final score was, 
it wasn’t that 
close.”

Michigan looking to continue growth against Western Michigan

For 
a 
relatively 
young 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team, every game is another 
opportunity to grow.
A Thursday night trip to 
Kalamazoo to take on Western 
Michigan (1-1) is no different.
Though 
the 
Wolverines 
(1-0) may have Big Ten title 
aspirations come the end of 
the season, their goals are 
much less ambitious at the 
moment.
“I think the team is just 
focusing 
on 
getting 
better 
each 
and 
everyday,” said 
senior 
guard 
Nicole Munger. 
“We’re looking 
to be the best 
team 
we 
can 
be, and that’s 
going to take 
some time but 
everybody 
is 
enthusiastic 
about 
the 
process.”
Michigan is coming off a 
dominant home opener against 
Mount St. Mary’s, where its 
starters combined for 62 points 
en route to an 88-40 win. The 
Wolverines’ defense was a 
bit shaky in the first quarter, 
allowing Mount St. Mary’s to 
score nearly half their total 
points within the first quarter. 
The offense picked up the 
slack though. Senior center 
Hallie Thome, specifically, got 

anything she wanted.
With Michigan in control, 
coach Kim Barnes Arico could 
afford to empty the bench and 
give freshmen some valuable 
game 
experience. 
Forward 
Naz Hillmon scored 10 points, 
while guards Ariel Young and 
Emily Kiser pitched in four 
points each.
There 
wasn’t 
much 
to 
complain about from Barnes 
Arico’s perspective, but with 
some tough tests coming up 
at the end of November, every 
minute detail counts. So as 
Michigan turns its attention 
to the Broncos, 
the team’s focus 
is 
on 
starting 
strong.
“I 
think 
for 
the 
entire 
team, freshmen 
included, 
it’s 
important 
that 
we come out of 
the gates ready 
to play for 40 
minutes,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think that’s 
happened to us the past couple 
of games where we came out 
kinda comfortable and in the 
first quarter they scored a lot 
more baskets than we would’ve 
liked. Once we settle down and 
follow the game plan, I think 
we were able to stop them and 
really do a good job. So the goal 
is really to play that way for 40 
minutes.”
If the Wolverines hope to 
accomplish this, their defense 
will have to be cognizant of 

Western Michigan’s forward 
Leighah-Amori 
Wool. 
The 
sophomore starter is averaging 
18 points through the Broncos’ 
first two games. Though most 
of Western Michigan’s other 
contributors are experienced 
upperclassmen, none of them 
present 
the 
scoring 
threat 
that Wool does. As a result, 
the Michigan lineup should 
be well-equipped to deal with 

them.
The 
Wolverines’ 
length 
should also help their cause. 
Much like Mount St. Mary’s, 
Western 
Michigan’s 
lineup 
doesn’t feature a player taller 
than six feet — Wool being the 
tallest. Down low, Thome and 
6-foot-2 
sophomore 
Hailey 
Brown should be able to take 
advantage.
Following 
Western 

Michigan, 
Michigan 
will 
return 
home 
for 
a 
game 
against Detroit Mercy, before 
its schedule really heats up 
Thanksgiving weekend at the 
Gulf Coast Showcase.
“We’re 
going 
down 
to 
Florida to play Missouri in the 
opening round,” Barnes Arico 
said. “In that tournament, 
dependent 
on 
how 
things 
shake out, we can have an 

opportunity to play Texas 
and Duke too. So three top-25 
programs: boom, boom, boom. 
Those early-season tests in 
the non-league will only help 
prepare us for league play.”
With all that said, priority 
number one for the Wolverines 
right 
now 
is 
their 
game 
against Western Michigan and 
the learning opportunity that 
comes with it.
