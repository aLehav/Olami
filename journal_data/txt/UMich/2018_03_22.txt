When LSA sophomore Izzy 

Nakisher entered the University 
of Michigan, she didn’t know 
her major. She visited her 
adviser, 
who 
was 
assigned 

to her at orientation, once 
every few weeks her freshman 
year, trying to figure out a 
direction. Four major changes 
later, Nakisher is now ready to 
declare. Her adviser, she said, 
was key in making this happen.

An 
academic 
adviser 
is 

assigned to students at the 
University 
during 
their 

orientation 
before 
starting 

school in the fall. According 
to the Newnan LSA Academic 
Advising 
Center’s 
website, 

general advising is meant to 
help students plan out their 
college as well as future careers. 

Newnan Director Tim Dodd 

wrote, in an email interview, 
many students seek help from 
advisers for issues regarding 
course selection, advice on 
their major or minor, or even 
personal issues.

The Maize Collective hosted 

their second “Industry Insight” 
panel 
series 
Wednesday 

night, inviting guests in the 
music industry to talk on 
their experiences in booking 
and promoting. University of 
Michigan students and local 
music 
enthusiasts 
gathered 

at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art to hear about 
the challenges of entering the 
music industry.

Moderator 
Augusta 

Morrison invited the diverse 
group of panelists to share how 
their personal endeavors led 
them to the positions they have 
now in booking, outreach and 
promotion.

Working in the industry for 

over 25 years, Christine Kitora 
currently works as the talent 
buyer and event coordinator for 
Ann Arbor’s Necto Nightclub.

“My path was definitely not a 

straight line,” Kitora said. “For 
many people in the industry, 

it’s never been a straight line.”

Kitora 
and 
many 
other 

panelists 
shared 
similar 

experiences of working at small 
clubs and venues, eventually 
working their way to new 
positions and facing different 
challenges at every new place.

Kitora 
emphasized 
the 

importance of the collaborative 
work behind each show, from 
those who mop venue floors 
to those who prepare the 
wardrobe.

“Any 
organization, 
any 

venue, any show is only as good 
as the sum of its parts. It takes 
everybody,” she said.

Jacobson, 
senior 

programming manager of the

offered his perspective on 
what drives him through long 
hours and hectic timelines.

“The

E. Royster Harper discusses Greek Life, racist Snapchat incident and gun violence

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
sat 

down with E. Royster Harper, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

vice president for student life, 
for a conversation Wednesday 
afternoon 
on 
current 
issues 

affecting 
both 
campus 
and 

national climate. Harper spoke on 
national issues, such as campus 
sexual assault, recent Michigan 
legislationto improve resources 

for survivors; gun violence and 
the 
University 
preparedness. 

Royster also touched on campus 
news, specifically, the University’s 
decision to move to a winter rush 
process for Greek life and the 
racist Snapchat featuring two 
students in blackface with the 
caption “#blacklivesmatter” that 
was circulated this past weekend.

Sexual assault
To begin, Harper spoke on 

issues of sexual assault and 
misconduct, highlighting actions 
the University has taken to 
hold perpetrators accountable. 

Recently, the Michigan state 
Senatepassed 
legislation 
to 

improve resources and support 
for 
survivors, 
specifically 

by expanding the statute of 
limitations on reporting sexual 
assault, increasing the number 
of 
mandatory 
reporters 
at 

universities and placing more 
emphasis on holding institutions 
accountable for failing to report 
cases of assault and harassment. 
Before the vote on this legislation 
occured, however, the Michigan 
Association of State Universities, 
of which the University is a 

member, 
attempted 
to 
delay 

voting on the bills in a move 
state 
Sen. 
Margaret 
O’Brien, 

R-Kalamazoo, 
claimed 
would 

“delay justice, or maybe the hope 
is to stop it entirely.”

In response to O’Brien’s claim, 

Harper stated these allegations 
are wrong, arguing that by 
asking for more time to consider 
possible legislation, universities 
are seeking the ability to consider 
options 
before 
jumping 
into 

conclusions that may not be as 
effective.

AMARA SHAIKH

In honor of National Women’s 

History Month, panelists as part 
of the “Women in Public Service” 
panel spoke about their career 
paths as female leaders working 
in the political sphere, pivotal 
changes in their lives and career 
advice.

Erin 
Byrnes, 
lead 
for 

democratic engagement at the 
Ginsberg Center, spoke about the 
intended event impact and the 
importance of conversations of 
this nature.

“Our democratic engagement 

work is focused on multiple 
different facets, one of which is 
really encouraging our students 
to see themselves in a body of 
elected officials – people who 
are doing important work behind 
the scenes,” Byrnes said. “We 
are in the midst of a national 
conversation about what women 
are doing, how they’re treated 
and how they deserve to be 
treated. The more we can bring 
unique voices and experiences 
to the table and highlight them, 
that’s better for all of us as a 
community.”

Panelists discussed challenges 

they faced while trying to 
break 
into 
the 
industry. 

Ghida 
Dagher, 
director 
of 

Government Partnerships and 
Community Affairs at United 
Way for Southeastern Michigan, 
discussed how she had to make 
a distinct effort to be heard in 
political spaces.

“I had a realization that I had 

to be twice as loud, twice as vocal 
as everyone else in the room,” 
Dagher said. “Quite often I’m the 
youngest person in the room … 
and because of the nature of our 
work, I’m usually the only woman 
in the room. I have to think about 
everything – kind of absorb, seek 
out the players and understand 
what’s 
happening, 
and 
then 

vocalize.”

She continued by speaking on 

how she felt women were held 
to a different standard than most 
men in politics, responding to a 
comment another panelist made 
about how female politicians 
should “never stand by the bar, 
and be seen with a drink in hand.”

“I think there are a lot of social 

norms, I would call them, that 
are acceptable for men and are 
not acceptable for women in this 
space,” she said. “Particularly in 
this space, I feel like the women 

are under a microscope, every 
movement, if you’re a candidate, 
what you wear is open for 
criticism.”

University 
Regent 
Andrea 

Fischer Newman, R, agreed with 
the statement, adding she felt the 
#MeToo movement was pivotal 
in giving women an opportunity 
to speak up about the pervasive 
issue of sexual assault and 
harassment. 

For many students, meeting 

Reggie the Campus Corgi, also 
known as Reggie Bee, is the 
highlight of their day or even 
their week. So, it comes as no 
surprise that when a campaign 
was started on March 16 to elect 
Reggie Bee for Central Student 
Government president, students 
showed their support. Three 
days after the creation of the 
Reggie Bee for CSG Facebook 
page, 
Reggie 
accepted 
the 

nomination.

Engineering 
junior 
Brett 

Swiecicki voted for Reggie as 
CSG president.

“Honestly, with the content 

I’m exposed to on a daily basis, 
personal, interpersonal, on social 
media or in print advertising, 
Reggie was the only person 
that I knew that was ‘officially 
running’ for Central Student 
Government,” Swiecicki said. “I 
was aware of other platforms, but 
I wasn’t aware of any of the other 
people that were running or what 
they stood for. The main reason I 
wanted him to win is because I 
feel as though he should be more

If you founded a CSG party

“We want to have integrity 

in holding people accountable, 
and we need a time frame that 
allows for that,” Harper said. 
“Sometimes 
in 
reactions 
to 

horrific experiences, people are 
much more interested in doing 
something rather than being 
effective … I think we sometimes 
see 
that 
in 
the 
legislative 

process … really what it does is 
compromise institutions’ real 
ability to be effective.”

At the University, Harper said 

decision-making has revolved 
around 
considerations 
that 

would support survivors and 
keep 
resources 
confidential 

to allow for maximum choice 
for 
survivors. 
Harper 
also 

emphasized the importance of 
clarifying who the mandatory 
reporters include.

According 
to 
Harper, 

the University has hired a 
consultant to observe reporting 
mechanisms 
and 
provide 

feedback to administrators on 
what might be done differently. 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
has 
also 
brought 

together a team, which includes 
senior leaders, to look at current 
training objectives and work to 
make improvements.

“This is not an environment 

that is going to hide or condone 
or not hold people accountable 
for their behavior,” Harper said. 
“We are using the expertise 
here, and there’s tons of it, 
being clear about expectations, 
providing the training, making 
sure 
that 
people 
who 
are 

mandatory reporters know that, 
encouraging others to report, 
and making sure that there are 
some confidential sources like 
SAPAC, like CAPS, for the rest of 
our community.”

Gun safety
Harper then moved on to 

discuss issues of gun safety and 
the University’s measures to 
ensure the safety of everyone on 
campus in the case of an attack. 
Last week, students across the 
country participated in walkouts 

in response to the deadly school 
shooting at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School 
in 

Parkland, Fla. On campus and 
in Washtenaw County, various 
students 
havevoiced 
their 

concern for the preparedness 
and prevention of mass shootings 
at their respective schools.

Harper emphasized guns are 

not allowed on the University’s 
campus 
and 
explained 
the 

administration has completed 
many trainings in collaboration 
with the Department of Public 
Safety and Security to prepare 
themselves for a variety of 
dangerous situations.

“The leadership team has 

done active shooter planning, 
planning for bombs, so we do 
a pre-planning,” Harper said. 
“We have gone down to, what I 
call Central Control, but a place 
called 
Emergency 
Operation 

Center, again to figure out who 
would be calling, what would 
you be saying, to make sure the 
people you ought to be calling 
you actually have their phone 
numbers — prior preparation 

really to prevent a tragedy.”

She also praised DPSS 

Executive Director Eddie 
L. Washington Jr. for his 
preventative 
mindset 
in 

regard to campus safety.

“We have a phenomenal 

director of the Department 
of Public Safety and he 
has a mantra that has been 
enormously helpful: ‘Prevent 
the preventable.’”

Harper mentioned the 

University’s 
collaboration 

with other schools to ensure 
DPSS is up to date with 
trainings. Additionally, she 
feels the University has 
prepared itself in the best 
possible ways it can if an 
attack were to happen.

“Our 
department 
of 

public safety talks to other 
schools, gets training from 
other schools. We’ve gone 
to training around this,” 
Harper said. “I feel in the 
ways you can be prepared, or 
the things you can do to be 
prepared, we’ve been doing 
a lot.”

Though 
she 
said 
she 

feels the University is well-

prepared, Harper acknowledged 
the severity of the situation and 
explained the security systems 
implemented in various campus 
buildings. She also pointed out 
complete prevention is unlikely, 
but the administration and DPSS 
continue to ensure the likelihood 
is lessened.

“It is a constant issue that 

we’re thinking about, I know 
the department has gone out 
to classes, and has gone out to 
departments. I know they look 
at buildings to secure them. We 
certainly have a system where 
we can lock buildings down 
pretty quickly. All of those kinds 
of things are designed to help 
us reduce the likelihood that 
someone would be harmed. You 
and I know you can’t prevent it, 
there is not enough preparation 
to prevent it, but you can reduce 
the likelihood.”

Greek life winter rush process
Wednesday, the University 

announced 
recruitment 
for 

Greek life would be moved to the 
winter term starting in January 
2020, rather than the current 
fall rush process. Despite the 
previous Interfraternity Council 
social 
ban, 
Harper 
stated 

this decision is not related to 
current work to improve risk 
management issues.

“This is not about hazing. 

This is not about alcohol. This 
is not about sexual misconduct. 
This is about making sure that 
the students that are in the 11th 
grade now, when they come, 
that they have a really good 
experience, a fabulous first-year 
experience, and the research 
tells us that winter recruitment 
has 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 

academic success,” Harper said.

With specific emphasis on the 

first-year experience, Harper 
explained the goals of this 
decision are to allow for students 
to establish a pattern of academic 
success, develop strong and 
healthy relationships and give 
students a chance to participate 
in a diverse community with 
others who are different from 
themselves. 
She 
also 
hopes 

first-year students will have the 
opportunity to explore Greek 
life, which she considers a

lifelong 
commitment, 
before 

making the decision to rush.

Harper 
explained 
the 

expansions 
of 
learning 

communities 
and 
theme 

communities 
will 
help 
to 

compliment this improvement 
of the first-year experience. She 
hopes more students will have 
opportunities to take part in more 
extracurriculars and community 
service to feel more engaged and 
connected to the University.

“When students have a chance 

to pause and to think about it 
and to think about their interests 
and to test out some possibilities, 
they discover they have a passion 
for something else and that they 
want to make their contribution 
in a different way,” Harper said. 
“This is really designed to have us 
pause.”

Harper stated the University 

had winter recruitment processes 
in place during the late 1950s 
and early 1960s, and in 2015 a 
subcommittee was gathered to 
investigate options on delaying 
recruitment. By implementing 
the new recruitment stage in 
2020, Harper said, the Greek 
community will be given time for 
training and understanding of the 
new process.

Harper reiterated her argument 

against 
conversations 
that 

this change in the recruitment 
timeframe serves as a punishment 
to the Greek community.

“There has been some sort 

of framing that this is about 
punishing the Greek community. 
So we’re going to punish them by 
doing something 20 months from 
now? That’s a little dumb,” Harper 
said. “It is really about how do we 
ensure that the students we’re 
inviting to our community can do 
well.”

Racist Snapchat
Harper 
also 
discussed 

the 
University’s 
actions 
and 

responses after LSA sophomore 
Lauren Fokken released a racist 
Snapchat with herself and a friend 
in blackface with the caption 
“#blacklivesmatter.” 

Harper explained the Snapchat 

was inappropriate and against 
the University values. However, 
she was grateful for the number 
of students who reported the 
incident to the Bias Response 
Team on campus. The next step 
for the individuals involved is 
to see what consequences they 
would face at the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution.

“We were of course concerned, 

so we were clear about our values 
that is not welcome here,” Harper 
said. “Lots of students sent it to 
the Bias Response Team, which 
we enormously appreciate so we 
knew what was going on. There 
was an outreach to the students 
that were involved and they were 
in several conversations trying 
to understand why this behavior 
isn’t okay — it also happened to be 
a student employee — so of course 
it 
has 
different 
implications. 

Students were talked to. It is a 
case then that will make it to 
OSCR, our coding office, to look at 
what are the implications, how do 
we hold students accountable?”

The Office of Multi-Ethnic 

Student Affairs also held open 
office hours Saturday and Sunday 
for students who were impacted 
by the Snapchat to discuss how 
they were feeling. Harper touched 
on the widespread effect of 
ignorance and how the University 
needs to deny its place on campus 
as an entire community.

“Those are the kinds of things 

that we do when this kind of 
ignorance and racism shows up 
on our campus,” Harper said. “It’s 
very painful, for the students are 
subject to it, it’s very painful for all 
of us as a community that doesn’t 
condone that kind of behavior, 
and it is painful I believe for the 
students who engage in it.”

She furthered this sentiment 

and explained the importance 
of not only condemning racism 
but, in her opinion also allowing 
an opportunity for individuals to 
learn.

“Once this happens on our 

campus, then we have to decide 
as a community what kind of 
campus do we want to be,” Harper 
said. “We have to condemn it 
absolutely, then we have to leave 
space for people to change, to 
grow, to understand what is 
inappropriate about it, and to 
make 
restoration, 
and 
that’s 

what we try to do in the OSCR 
process. Bring students in who 
engage in this behavior, have a 
dialogue about it, try to help them 
understand its impact, sometimes 
have them talk with the folks to 
whom it impacted.”

She 
also 
addressed 
the 

dilemma she faced in her own role 
as vice president for student life 
and balancing accountability with 
room for restoration.

“That’s the challenge in my 

role. It is both about holding 
people accountable and creating 
space for them to change and 
grow.” Harper said, “Sometimes 
when you’re hurt, when I’m 
hurt, 
I’m 
not 
interested 
in 

anybody changing or growing, 
I’m interested in them being 
punished, but we don’t want to be 
only that kind of community.”

While allowing an opportunity 

for growth is important to Harper, 
she acknowledged the importance 
of calling the Snapchat out for 
what it really was.

“I think we have to talk about 

that (the Snapchat), and name it 
for what it is: It was racist, it was 
inappropriate, it does do harm,” 
she said. “We have to name it 
before we can do something about 
it, and when we do something 
about it we have to create space 
for the person to still be in the 
community.”

Harper said she understands 

the impact racist incidents have 
on minority communities and 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of speaking up to ensure those 
groups 
are 
not 
negatively 

impacted. She also said actions of 
violence, whether they be sexual, 
ethnic or racial, all come from 
the same place of disrespecting 
another individual or group’s 
humanity.

“It does mean there are some 

students who are carrying a bigger 
burden around, and that’s why all 
of us have to say something so 
that the people that are targeted 
are not harmed,” Harper said. 
“I believe it’s the same kind of 
disregard 
for 
other 
people’s 

humanity and for their bodies and 
their minds and their intellect 
that causes a person to do sexual 
violence – (it) comes from the 
same place of, ‘I get to decide who 
ought to be in the community.’ 
Who put you in charge? Who put 
you in charge of deciding who is 
the ‘other’ in the community?”

La Casa
In February, the Latinx Alliance 

for Community Action, Support 
and Advocacy released a list of 
demands to the administration 
with steps they felt needed to be 
taken to better support the Latinx 
community. The demands arose 
after several racial incidents 
and a boycott against the lack 
of Latinx representation across 
different University levels. It has 
been about a month and a half 
after the initial demands were 
released, and Harper commented 
on the University’s efforts toward 
implementing La Casa’s requests.

“We 
have 
been 
meeting 

with La Casa members and 
faculty members of the Latinx 
community, I would say for maybe 
at least a month, and sometimes 
twice a day,” Harper said. “Going 
through what the concerns are, 
and in some cases bringing people 
in to help us understand what 
we’re currently doing.”

She also said the administration 

was looking over the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion Campus 

Climate 
survey 
released 
last 

fall to better understand the 
experience of Latinx students at 
the University.

“Last Friday, we looked at 

the climate data, what does our 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
student data tell us about the 
experience of Latinx students, 
and what they are experiencing 
in relation to other students,” 
Harper said.

Harper 
explained 
the 

administration is also working 
to 
consolidate 
the 
different 

demands 
and 
come 
to 
an 

understanding of how they will 
proceed with actionable steps. 
She praised the members of 
La Casa for calling attention 
to issues their community is 
facing and acknowledged the 
administration’s 
willingness 

to work with them on creating 
solutions.

“It would be premature for 

me to say this is where we are 
because we are in the process of 
figuring out together where we 
are,” Harper said. “I think that 
the Latinx community has raised 
some important issues. That is 
one of the things really I admire 
about our students here that they 
will see a concern and raise the 
issue, and what I love about the 
administration is that we are 
responsive. So we are engaged in 
that discussion dialogue process 
right now to better understand 
and then to figure out given what 
the needs are what it is that we 
are able to do.”

Commuting and accessibility
In terms of accessibility for 

students, Harper spoke on current 
resources available to students, 
as well as the University’s push 
to make these resources more 
widely known and available. In 
response to students on campus 
calling for more accessibility, 
including 
commuter 
students 

and those who face financial 
strain in paying for on-campus 
and finding off-campus housing, 

Harper stated administration has 
been working more closely with 
individual schools and colleges to 
provide resources.

“We 
have 
many 
more 

resources than students know 
about,” Harper said. “With our 
communications department and 
each of our units, we’re trying to 
get better at making sure students 
understand the resources that 
are available. Right now, we’ve 
asked the schools and colleges 
and others who are providing 
resources to tell us what is the 
resource, who is it for, how many 
people does it involve, and trying 
to get a catalog of what’s available 
so we can figure out how we 
make this more apparent and 
transparent to students.”

Harper 
also 
discussed 

providing 
resources 
to 
first-

year students, explaining while 
administration is working to 
make the depth and breadth of 
resources more transparent for 
students, freshman orientation 
can often be too busy of a time to 
highlight all of these resources. 
Harper said the problem is often 
caused because of the immense 
quantities of options.

In addition, Harper spoke 

on the importance of listening 
to students and explained that, 
while it may not always be 
possible to resolve the issue in 
the ways students are asking for, 
there is always room for progress 
and improvement.

“As the vice president, when 

I hear from students of color 
or 
students 
with 
disabilities 

or 
underrepresented 
minority 

students or low-income students 
or 
high-income 
students 
for 

whom this place isn’t working, 
I take it seriously,” Harper said. 
“I first try to listen then I try to 
understand, I take the concern 
seriously, 
because 
sometimes 

it affects a small population, 
sometimes it’s a large population, 
but to me all of those students are 
important.”

day, I’m certainly a fan. A lot 
of us are fans, that’s why we’re 
here. You have to love the music, 
and you have to love the art.”

Students and local residents 

from all backgrounds said they 
came to the event in hopes of 
gaining valuable advice from 
experts who were once in their 
shoes.

LSA senior Dyshon Toxey 

Jr. is a local artist who said 
he attended the event to learn 
more about the industry he’s 
passionate about. He said it was 
helpful hearing the panelists 
speak about the challenges they 
once faced and learned they all 
took non-linear paths. 

“I’m trying to meet up with 

them, network and build more 
connections, just so that I can 
grow and potentially be in their 
position, and next year be the 
one speaking,” he said.

Jacobson also had some advice 

for artists like Toxey.

“Just keep doing what you’re 

doing. If you make good music 
and you’re passionate about it, 
people are going to follow you 
and come to your shows,” he 
said.

The music industry requires 

experience, and many students 
at 
the 
University, 
including 

LSA senior Jessie Baren, feel 
as though their classes aren’t 
preparing them properly.

“Coming 
into 
Michigan, 

there’s not a music business 

or 
entertainment 
industry 

classes,” he said. “So I think 
it’s really cool Maize Collective 
and 
organizations 
like 
that 

are putting on these kinds of 
events for us, because they are 
beneficial.”

Maize 
Collective 
founder 

James Roeser, an Information 
senior, said he also felt this 
frustration during his time at 
the University. Between his 
sophomore and junior year, he 
crafted the Maize Collective, a 
hands-on organization to help 

interested University students 
get the real-life experiences they 
need for starting careers in the 
music industry.

“There’s a lot of disperse 

music communities on campus, 
but no central place to learn 
what’s going on, or how you 
can get involved and meet other 
people, especially if you’re not in 
the music school,” he said.

The Maize Collective isn’t 

just for musicians. The club 
offers opportunities for growth 
in areas like art and design 

and 
marketing. 
Events 
like 

“Industry Insight” are meant to 
give students interested in all 
creative industries the chance 
to meet professionals who were 
once students like them.

“The stuff people are talking 

about is all applicable to other 
industries and areas,” Roeser 
said. “Most people have a central 
interest in music and creating, 
even if you’re not 100 percent 
going into the music industry, 
it’s 
also 
a 
great 
learning 

opportunity.”

their own unique, authentic 
and powerful narratives that 
inform 
their 
decisions 
and 

create alignment, confidence 
and coherence in their lives,” 
Dodd wrote.

Nashiker said her adviser’s 

interest in getting to know 
her was one of the reasons she 
had a positive experience with 
advising.

“He’s made an effort to talk 

to me about my hobbies and 
my life,” Nashiker said. “So 
he’s said that this major may 
suit your hobbies or might suit 
the classes you’ve been taking 
and have been liking. I think if 
you have the time to get to talk 
to a student then you’re better 
off when suggesting classes or 
majors or minors.”

Newnan adviser Tim Webb 

said he looks at his students 
holistically, not just in terms of 
their academic goals.

“I like to talk to students 

how that will work with their 
professional goals, clubs and 
social life: how to be a successful 
student, but also maximize 
their 
time 
on 
Michigan’s 

campus,” 
Webb 
said. 
“I’m 

also an advocate for health on 
campus, making sure you have 
the time and space to take care 
of yourself.”

Part of Webb’s job is helping 

students navigate the resources 
on 
campus, 
which 
include 

the 
Opportunity 
Hub 
and 

departmental advising, among 
others.

For LSA senior Jenny Luo, 

specific departmental advising 
was more useful to her than 
general Honors advising.

“I always felt like when I 

talked to (my general adviser) 
it was always about what he 
wanted rather than my own 

direction and ideas for my 
education,” Luo said. “There 
was something that he wanted 
to push.”

Luo went to see her general 

adviser the end of her freshman 
year before selecting classes 
and has not returned to general 
advising since.

“There was one instance 

where I went to see him before 
I chose my classes second 
semester of my freshman year 
and he was very condescending 
towards 
me 
regarding 
the 

Honors core classes,” Luo said.

Apart 
from 
general 

advising, Luo has also gone 
to see departmental advisers 
in chemistry and computer 
science for more major-oriented 
information. 
Luo 
said 
the 

departmental 
advisers 
have 

been helpful before selecting 
classes and in providing more 
information 
about 
potential 

post-graduation plans.

“Most of the departmental 

advisers that I’ve worked with 
have always been more about 
what do you want accomplished 
and how we can help you with 
that,” Luo said.

With 
there 
being 
many 

advisers on campus, Dodd wrote 
students should find advisers 
that work well for them.

“I want students to find that 

advisor who makes them feel 
comfortable and confident in 
their exploration and decision 
making,” 
Dodd 
wrote. 
“No 

advisor gets upset if a student 
meets with a different advisor.

A 
coordinator 
for 
the 

undergraduate 
program 
in 

the 
Sociology 
department, 

Tammy Kennedy is also an 
adviser for students pursuing 
a major or minor in Sociology. 
Kennedy works with current 
as well as prospective students 
to help them get a feel for the 
department.

Kennedy 
said 
students 

majoring 
or 
minoring 
in 

sociology are required to come 
to her for two reasons: to declare 
their major and get a release 
for 
graduation. 
Other 
than 

that, students mostly go if they 
have any questions about the 
department, classes and future 
career paths after sociology.

“I 
want 
to 
make 
the 

University as small as possible 
for them,” Kennedy said. “It’s 
a really big university that’s 
often siloed and we sit in our 
own departments. I want to 
connect students as easily as 
possible to other departments 
and resources that I know of 
and would be helpful to them.”

If a student is unsure about 

committing 
to 
the 
major, 

Kennedy 
usually 
arranges 

for the student to meet with 
a faculty member, speak to 
another 
student 
or 
attend 

social 
events 
within 
the 
 

department to give them a 
better idea.

“I 
think 
students 
are 

pressured earlier and earlier in 
their academic career to pick 
a major and make a decision,” 
Kennedy said. “My line is that 
I don’t get paid any more if 
you major in sociology. I’m not 
trying to convince you for my 
own personal gain.”

Before applying to the School 

of Kinesiology and the School 
of Public Health, Nakisher said 
her general adviser also helped 
her create a back-up plan in case 
it didn’t work out.

“I talked to a lot of students 

who applied to these programs 
and 
didn’t 
have 
a 
backup 

for when they didn’t get in,” 
Nakisher said. “I was ready to 
go right after I got notice that I 
didn’t get in.”

Webb is also co-president 

of the Advising Council at the 
University, 
which 
connects 

advisers 
from 
the 
various 

schools 
across 
campus. 

Compared to other schools, 
Webb said LSA offers more 
freedom in their majors in terms 
of electives.

“There is so much more 

space and time to figure out 
their major,” Webb said. “My 
colleagues at Newnan really 
have a great understanding of 
the curriculum and the courses 
that 
LSA 
offers 
and 
help 

students navigate their major.”

In reference to issues Newnan 

advising faces, Dodd wrote 
adviser turnover is an issue 
both the center and students are 
forced to navigate.

“I 
sympathize 
with 
the 

student who really likes his or 
her advisor only to learn a year 
or two later that the advisor has 
left to take a bigger job or moved 
away from Ann Arbor for family 
reasons,” Dodd wrote.

For LSA sophomore Lorraine 

Furtado, her original adviser 
assigned to her at orientation 
left in the fall.

“(My original adviser) sent 

me a lovely email that she was no 
longer advising,” Furtado said. 
“She said I would be assigned to 
a new adviser, but she didn’t say 
who that adviser was.”

Furtado found out who her 

new adviser was just a few days 
ago, months after orientation, 
when she had scheduled an 
appointment with a different 
adviser, who then checked and 
told her.

As a first-generation student, 

Furtado said navigating the 
course selection process and 
selecting a major was difficult 
at first.

“The advice I received was 

along the lines of follow your 
heart’s desire, which is hard to 
hear knowing that what I do in 
my undergrad has to potentially 
be a career option,” Furtado 
said. “I ended up taking her 
advice, which I’m really grateful 
for now.”

“I wish it was happening 

when I was younger, 10 years 
ago,” Newman said. “Because 
you must call it out, you can do 
it nicely, but you must call it out. 
The #MeToo campaign has given 
women everywhere the wake-up 
they needed to say something. 
When you get out there, most of 
you aren’t out there yet, there’s 
definitely a difference in how 
women are treated by an older 
generation. This campaign really 
brought a whole new level to this 
issue and we can’t let it go away, 
it’s too important.”

Public Policy student Erica 

Muñoz-Rumsey, who is also in 
the School of Public Health, spoke 
of how she loved the diversity of 
the panel and hearing about these 
women’s experiences.

“I was excited to see a panel 

where we hear some different 

perspectives 
from 
people 
in 

different kinds of public service,” 
Muñoz-Rumsey said. “I thought 
they brought a lot of stories that 
I hadn’t heard before to the table. 
They had different experiences 
and weren’t afraid to disagree 
with each other.”

Saskia DeVries, a graduate 

student 
in 
the 
School 
of 

Information and Ford School of 
Public Policy, agreed, emphasizing 
the honest approach panelists 
embodied.

“It was really cool to hear a 

candid conversation between a 
bunch of women who made the 
decision to enter public service 
at different points in their lives,” 
DeVries said. “I appreciated the 
candor and the stories that people 
shared. I think it’s important that 
when we have these conversations 
that inspire women to enter public 
service that we are honest about 
the challenges too … I want to go in 
knowing what to expect and how 
to prepare for that.”

officially integrated into the 
University. I know a lot of other 
people wanted to vote for Reggie 
because they wanted to prove 
to the other students running 
that they didn’t really believe 
in their ideas as much as a dog, 
essentially.”

However, 
on 
Wednesday 

afternoon, midway through the 
two-day election, Reggie Bee 
announced his resignation on 
Facebook. By that time, the page 
created in order to elect him had 
already received nearly 600 likes.

“Because some of my good 

human 
friends 
are 
‘truly’ 

running for Student Government 
President, I’ve decided to ask all 
my friends to get out and Vote 

for Them. They deserve your 
support in their sincere desire 
to become leaders of the student 
body.” the post said.

In a follow-up post, Reggie 

once again encouraged students 
to go online and vote for the 
human 
candidates 
in 
the 

election, adding he “ran out of 
steam.”

While some students were 

excited about the prospect of 
Reggie 
becoming 
president, 

others, such as LSA senior 
Zach Xu, feel that a dog could 
not serve as the student body 
president.

“I legit think the whole Reggie 

thing is a joke,” Xu said. “Reggie 
is not a human being. And if he 
won by popular vote, it would 
be ridiculous for a dog to serve 
as a president of a major public 
university in the United States.”

Confirm Pompeo, Deny Haspel

 BRETT GRAHAM | COLUMN

C

orporate America has a lot of 
work to do if it wants to achieve 
any form of gender equity.

According to a 2014 fact sheet from 

the Center for American Progress, 
women earn almost 60 percent of all 
bachelor’s degrees and 60 percent of 
master’s degrees. Yet, somehow, they 
make up only 14.6 percent of executive 
officers, 8.1 percent of top earners and 
4.6 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs. They 
hold only 16.9 percent of Fortune 500 
board seats.

Here we face a dilemma. We 

want the girls and young women 
to grow up and earn these upper-
level business positions, therefore 
increasing gender equality in the 
business world. But we also know, 
based on these statistics alone, 
corporate America isn’t always 
the most welcoming place for a 
woman. How can we ensure the 
women who enter the business 
world feel empowered to believe 
they are capable of earning a 
highly-paid leadership position?

According 
to 
Quinnipiac 

University’s 
Women’s 
Rugby 

Head Coach Becky Carlson, the 
first D1 women’s NCAA coach for 
a full-contact sport, the first step 
to achieving gender equity in the 
workplace is working toward gender 
equity in sports, she said in a phone 
interview with The Daily.

More than 3.2 million girls in 

the United States played high school 
sports in 2010, and about 200,000 
young women played college sports 
in 2012. This is often their first 
experience working as part of a team 
to achieve a greater goal, and one of 
their first experiences taking on a major 
leadership role, such as team captain. 
The skills student athletes obtain 
through their sport translate directly to 
the business world. Unfortunately, for 
female athletes, playing a sport is often 
also their first experience facing blatant 
sexual discrimination.

Carlson often notices major gender 

inequity in college athletics, even when 
it means schools are noncompliant 
with Title IX, the law that requires 
federally-funded institutions (such as 
public schools) do not discriminate 
based on sex. At athletic events and 
seminars, she often explains her 
position to athletic directors and 
administrators by saying, “Women’s 
Varsity Rugby, the only full contact 
sport of women in the NCAA.”

“I get this response from people, 

and it ranges from insulting, to, ‘Oh, 
sweetie, our gender equity is fine, 
we don’t need you’ or, ‘You don’t look 
like a rugby player,’” she explained 
in a phone interview. “I often got 

the, ‘We’re in compliance (with Title 
IX), we’re fine,’ and I would always 
take notes on these universities that 
would say this, and they were not fine 
or in compliance.”

Even though Title IX was 

implemented almost half a century 
ago, the glaring gender inequity in 
today’s sports world is no secret. 
According to Athletic Business, girls’ 
sports lack not only recognition, 
but uniforms and equipment. Take 
a trip to any high school athletic 
facilities and this will be made 
abundantly clear. Or look at the 
ESPN or Sports Illustrated website 
to see that the sports world values the 
accomplishments of its male athletes 
much more highly than those of 
female athletes. Would it be much 
of a surprise if after female athletes 
graduate and enter the workplace, 
they subconsciously internalize the 
idea that their accomplishments are 
not as valuable as those of their 
male counterparts?

“If we’re doing what we’re 

supposed to be doing in athletics — 
and it doesn’t have anything to do 
with dribbling, kicking, running, 
passing — it has everything to do 
with preparing them for what lies 
ahead,” Carlson said. “And what 
lies ahead is a system that is not 
going to ask you if you’d like a raise, 
it is a system that is not going to ask 
you to speak louder, it’s just going 
to pass you over.”

Carlson believes her primary role 

as a coach is to empower her athletes to 
succeed beyond the playing field.

“The first pitch that I make when 

I’m with recruits isn’t, ‘Hey, this is the 
scholarship opportunity and this is how 
great it is to play on the field and this is 
the amenities we have,’” she said. “No, 
the first pitch is, ‘I want you to leave here 
with the understanding that you can 
speak in the boardroom.’”

Her goal is for her athletes to 

graduate feeling comfortable asking 
questions, speaking up and negotiating 
their salaries. She doesn’t want them to 
graduate with the belief that no matter 
how hard they worked, they would 
still be second class compared to their 
male counterparts. Achieving this goal 
begins on the rugby field.

“I coach a full contact sport 

and we’ve been three-time national 
champions,” she said. “And I still see 
that when an athlete tackles and goes 
down for a second and needs a moment 
to shake it off and get up, our male 
trainers are up, off the bench, running 
out there. I’m like, give them a second. 
Give them a second … That never 
happens when a male athlete needs a 
second. They’re not running out there. 

We rush; we see (women) as weaker. 
That’s something in our athletes that I 
would like to see change. I would like 
for us to be able to say, ‘I would push this 
athlete the same way I would push a 
male athlete.’”

In other instances, she has seen 

women coaches criticized for being 
too “harsh” on their athletes, when 
male coaches are respected for the 
very same coaching tactics.

“It’s always, ‘She’s tough on them 

and he’s a great leader,’” she lamented. 
“They show Coach K and they’ll show 
Geno and in every photo those guys 
are coaching and they look serious and 
they look badass, right? It’s revered: 
It’s strength, it’s impressive, it is a 
champion’s face. And then you take 
the pictures that DNT has been using 
of Shannon (Miller) and she’s greedy, 
stubborn, unwilling to work.”

Carlson noted that this mindset 

translates directly to the business 
world. “That male CEO that you 
work under goes in and tells everyone 
how it is and everyone’s like, ‘Yeah, 
he’s a boss, he’s badass,’” she said. 
“And you go into the boardroom and 
the woman tells you what to do 
and she’s considered bitchy, or 
considered moody.”

Several times, Carlson has seen 

her athletes reap the benefits of 
her female empowering coaching 
tactics. One of her athletes had been 
interning for a company for two 
years and wanted to be hired there 
after graduation, but believed she 
deserved more than the entry level 
salary that employees who had never 
worked there would earn.

“She went in,” Carlson recalled. 

“She directly said, ‘This is the value I 
bring to the company and if you want 
to hire me, this is my requirement.’ 
They said no initially, but she kept 
her head up after that, and she was 
still interning with them. Two weeks 
later, they turned around and were 
like, ‘You know, we really don’t want 
to lose you, we’ll take that salary 
bump and we want to hire you.’”

Why 
was 
this 
athlete 
so 

confident? Carlson explained: “A 
recognition and appreciation and a 
reverence for strength in athletics 
moves over to this life after college.”

The answer is simple. If we treat 

women as second-class citizens when 
they’re on the rugby field, we 
can’t expect them to understand 
that they’re equal as soon as they 
enter the boardroom.

L

ast week, in the latest 
round 
of 
“Survivor: 

West 
Wing 
Edition,” 

President Donald Trump fired 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 
and nominated Mike Pompeo, 
current CIA director and former 
Tea Party congressman, to take 
his place. To fill Pompeo’s post, 
Trump 
nominated 
Pompeo’s 

deputy, Gina Haspel. Each of 
these people would be a disaster 
in their post and potentially 
irreparably harmful to both U.S. 
foreign policy and what little 
moral standing this country 
has left. Senate Democrats, 
however, in the current political 
climate, should consider biting 
the 
bullet 
and 
confirming 

Pompeo, 
while 
remaining 

firmly opposed to Haspel.

First of all, it is important to 

establish why both are so odious. 
Pompeo is your standard order, 
run-of-the-mill Republican hawk; 
his career has been financed 
almost entirely thanks to the 
Koch brothers, he puts forward 
a “hard line” on terrorism that 
often bleeds into Islamophobia, 
he thinks the National Security 
Agency’s surveillance program 
does “good and important work” 
and he wants Edward Snowden 
extradited 
and 
sentenced 
to 

death. He resembles, in more 
ways than one, an external-facing, 
slightly younger Joe Arpaio, the 
former Arizona sheriff known 
for his controversial stance on 
immigration law.

Compared to his deputy 

and potential successor, he’s 
also the more palatable of the 
two. Haspel ran a CIA torture 
site in Thailand in the early 
2000s, where prisoners were 
waterboarded, slammed against 
walls and confined within coffin-
like boxes. For those not already 
sold on her, she later oversaw the 
destruction of the video evidence 
that would have almost certainly 
damned her as a war criminal in 

violation of the United Nations 
Convention Against Torture. 
So, torture and a cover-up. 
Double trouble.

There are, though, a few 

fundamental situational factors 
to take into account. First of all, 
consider the current state of 
the agencies that each of these 
would-be 
Kubrick 
characters 

have been nominated to run. 
The 
State 
Department 
has 

been understaffed to the point 
that, by many accounts, it is 
struggling to function properly. 
As recently as February, no 
fewer than 45 ambassadorships 
were 
left 
vacant, 
many 
of 

which are to important world 
powers and allies. South Korea, 
Australia, 
Germany, 
Turkey 

and Saudi Arabia all belong to 
this group. Though the thought 
of 
staffing 
these 
positions 

with conservative, reactionary 
ideologues is not the most 
appealing eventuality, there is 
foreign policy merit to having 
warm bodies in those chairs. 
Pompeo has been, according 
to reports, decently effective 
and well-liked at the CIA. A 
lukewarm 
performance 
like 

that would be a major step up 
from what State looked like 
under Tillerson.

Secondly, after he staffs the 

place up and gets it in working 
order, there’s a good chance that 
most foreign policy will still 
be run out of the White House. 
More than temperament, what 
impeded Rex Tillerson’s ability 
to get things done was the fact 
that any diplomatic conversation 
or stance could and would be 
thrown out the window in 140 
characters or fewer. Twitter is 
Trump’s State Department and 
he is his own ambassador to 
the world. That is not likely to 
change depending on whom is 
serving in that post.

For 
those 
news 
sources 

that seem to suggest Pompeo 

is different in any way to the 
sycophants that came before him 
— that Trump listens, trusts or 
respects him more than anyone 
else who has come through the 
White House to this point — 
please stop. There was a time 
that he listened to Steve Bannon, 
too. At other times, it was going 
to be Jared Kushner and Ivanka 
Trump’s cooler heads prevailing. 
Remember 
when 
we 
were 

supposed to collectively breathe 
a sigh of relief when John Kelly 
entered the picture because he 
was a moderating force to who 
Trump listened? How’s that 
working out?

Pompeo 
is 
not 
a 
game 

changer and, at this point in time, 
we should treat that as a victory. 
Republicans face a tough road 
between now and the midterm 
elections. Now is not the time to 
pick a confirmation fight over a 
nominee as qualified as Pompeo, 
just to give them a bit of slack 
and make people think that this 
is partisanship business as usual.

Senate 
Democrats 
should 

nonetheless make a distinction; 
Pompeo, 
though 
abhorrent, 

is qualified to do the job and 
the State Department needs a 
secretary. The CIA, on the other 
hand, is not in any state of crisis 
whatsoever (that we know of). 
It does not necessarily need this 
modern-day 
Torquemada 
to 

keep the lights on and the trains 
on time, so to speak.

Pompeo is just about on 

par when it comes to what 
we expected from a Trump 
nominee. Confirm him. The 
State 
Department 
needs 
a 

secretary. Haspel is almost 
undeniably a war criminal. 
The CIA can wait for someone 
much better.

All other signed articles and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

 Lecturers vary from part 
to full time, teaching one to 
three or even more courses 
per semester. These educators 
teach 
in 
nearly 
every 

department 
and 
program 

across all three campuses 
and have worked closely with 
fellow University educators 
and students, contributing to 
both the academic and greater 
University community. As an 
Editorial Board, we believe it 
is imperative the University 
takes 
the 
demands 
and 

propositions of LEO seriously 
and invest in our educators, 
giving them the support that 
they need and deserve.
 A great number of University 
undergraduate students have 
been taught by lecturers, and 
these qualified University 
employees 
are 
being 

underpaid and left without 
the beneficiary support they 
need. The current minimum 
salary 
for 
University 

lecturers is $34,500 at Ann 
Arbor, $28,300 at Dearborn 
and $27,300 at Flint. As 
reported in the University’s 
2016 
and 
2017 
audited 

financial statements, these 
lecturers brought in $462 
million in revenue, while 
the 
cost 
of 
employment 

for 
these 
educators 
was 

only 
$85 
million. 
Their 

contributions 
and 
work 

contribute 
significantly 

to the economics of the 
University, 
and 
yet 
they 

are 
not 
receiving 
wages 

and benefits that reflect 
this. When compared, many 
lecturers 
are 
being 
paid 

less than their surrounding 
colleagues 
at 
various 

institutions, 
including 

Washtenaw 
Community 

College and a variety of 
public 
high 
schools, 
and 

definitively 
less 
than 

tenure-track professors at 
the University, where the 
average salary is $148,800 
at the Ann Arbor campus. 
This contrast becomes even 
starker 
when 
considering 

that 
the 
average 
salary 

for 
female 
lecturers 
is 

$13,154 less than their male 
counterparts. The lecturers 
of the University are not 
being paid fairly, and when 
considering what they bring 
to all three campuses in terms 
of academics, economics and 
community-engagement, 
the LEO request to raise the 
minimum salary to $60,000 
in Ann Arbor and $56,000 in 
Dearborn and Flint does not 
seem unwarranted.
 LEO has been very vocal 
about 
their 
bargaining 

platforms and have a strong 
online presence that they use 
to document their successes 
and progress as negotiations 
continue. 
This 
platform, 

when reviewed, focuses not 
only on the issue of salary 
but also on benefits. Aspects 
such as an increase in child 
subsidy are crucial to the 
LEO platform, as these types 
of benefits are necessary 
to 
support 
lecturers 
in 

their work and with their 
families. Consistent health 
care and job security also 
aid 
this 
struggle, 
giving 

lecturers more stability in 
their family lives. Referring 
specifically to the Ann Arbor 
campus, lecturers are often 
not even able to live within 
the city they work in and 
contribute to due to the high 
cost of living and their own 
struggles with wages and 
benefits. The lack of direct 
support from the University 
to 
lecturers 
and 
their 

families could lead to them 
potentially leaving for other 

institutions, where they are 
more consistently supported 
and paid, with our campus 
losing critical members of the 
University community.
 
Lecturers 
are 
qualified 

and 
impactful 
educators 

who enrich the University 
experience 
for 
countless 

students, 
and 
their 

partnership 
and 
support 

helps the cause and impact 
of LEO. Students can get 
involved 
with 
LEO 
by 

showing up in solidarity to 
grade-ins 
and 
bargaining 

sessions (the next grade-in 
is March 29, with a regents 
meeting to follow). These 
events are often publicized 
on the LEO Facebook page, 
and 
outline 
how 
students 

can make an impact on the 
LEO negotiations. Lecturers 
are 
able 
to 
build 
strong 

relationships with a wide 
range of students on campus, 
often 
working 
in 
small 

classrooms and contributing 
to campus culture. By having 
not only members but also 
other faculty and students 
show 
their 
support 
and 

partnership with LEO, this 
could put pressure on the 
University to concede and 
meet the needs of University 
lecturers.
 The University has taken 
steps 
to 
reach 
fair 
and 

necessary compromises with 
LEO, 
but 
their 
stagnant 

changes to salary increases 
hurt not only the lecturers 
and academic excellence of 
the school, but the people 
who work consistently and 
closely with students. Both 
the University and students 
need to do their part by 
supporting 
those 
who 

dedicate their time and effort 
to our Michigan experience.

Jordan Poole’s next challenge

It doesn’t matter if Jordan 

Poole 
never 
makes 
another 

basket. He’s already cemented 
himself 
into 
Michigan 

basketball lore.

You’ve probably seen the shot 

a thousand times. Awkwardly 
released, fully covered, a heave 
in desperation. Yet it still found 
nylon, of course.

On 
Tuesday, 
Poole 
told 

reporters he was poked in the 
eye during the game, making it 
feel like he had a film over his 
pupil. It’s even more reason why 
the play is one of the most — if 
not the most — improbable shots 
of the NCAA Tournament.

Naturally, 
attention 
has 

swarmed Poole. Standing in 
a water-soaked locker room 
amidst a blinding artillery of 
camera lights, he opened his 
phone to 532 texts a half-an-
hour after the buzzer. They came 
from close friends to middle 
school teachers to pastors in his 
hometown Milwaukee.

Poole said his Instagram 

account has nearly doubled in 
followers up to roughly 51,000, 
which makes for the most on the 
team — something the freshman 
wasn’t hesitant to point out. 
Enough people on Twitter even 
mistook him for Jordan Peele, 
prompting the Oscar-winning 
“Get Out” director to fire off an 
ironic tweet about his jump-shot 
practice paying off.

Oh, and Poole graced our 

Sports Monday cover — clearly 
the most exciting of all.

As of Tuesday, Poole said he 

has watched the video of the 
shot at least 500 times. Even at 
that number, he said it doesn’t 
get old.

“Every time I watch it,” Poole 

said, “I keep getting goosebumps 
and butterflies because it’s just 
amazing that I hit the shot.

“I just can’t not smile every 

time I look at it, like, ‘Yo, I 
actually hit that.’ ”

There’s probably no other 

Wolverine who would enjoy 
these circumstances more than 
Poole. Guys like sophomores Jon 
Teske and Zavier Simpson, along 
with even captains Duncan 
Robinson and Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman are relatively 
reserved when swarms of media 
gather around after big-time 
performances.

But that’s not Poole. He was 

born for the spotlight, relishing 
almost all the focus that’s come 
his way.

“I mean, he’s got a lot of 

confidence, and he’ll tell you 
about it, too,” Michigan coach 

John Beilein told reporters on 
Saturday.

It’s 
that 
confidence, 
or 

“overdose 
of 
swagger” 
as 

Beilein said in 
a TV interview 
directly after the 
buzzer-beater, 
that 
allowed 

Poole to drill the 
shot and create 
memories 
for 

Michigan players 
and 
fans 
that 

will carry on for 
years.

But 
there’s 

still basketball left to be played. 
After all, just two wins separate 
the Wolverines from the Final 
Four. And that’s where Poole’s 

quandary comes. His “overdose 
of swagger” can be exactly that 
sometimes: an overdose.

Early in Big Ten Play, heat-

check 3-pointers, 
lapses 
on 

defense 
and 

the 
occasional 

failed highlight 
would 
irk 

Beilein, making 
an 
already 

short leash even 
shorter. As such, 
Poole 
played 

just 10.5 minutes 
through 
the 

season’s first 16 games.

But 
Poole 
soon 
began 

executing 
the 
simpler 

maneuvers — “winning plays” 

as Beilein describes them — and 
was rewarded with more agency 
and playing time.

And after a sturdy drought, 

Poole began to take off in late 
January. Fifteen points against 
Ohio State. A trio of 3-pointers 
against Maryland. A posterizing, 
SportsCenter-top-play 
dunk 

against Penn State. Poole was so 
effective that he began cutting 
into Charles Matthews’ minutes 
— the redshirt sophomore guard 
who led Michigan in scoring 
during non-conference play.

“(Poole) wasn’t in the rotation 

because he was learning so 
much about basketball that he 
wasn’t helping us,” Beilein said 
Feb. 20. “He was going to help 
us win games, but he matured. 

He got better.”

But 
then 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament hit, and Poole’s 
shot was off. After a 1-for-
9 effort in the quarterfinals, 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers 
was asked about his roommate’s 
struggles.

“He’ll pop out of his slump 

sometime,” Livers said. “He’s a 
natural scorer.”

“Slump?” Poole interjected 

from the locker over.

“You’re in a slump right now, 

bro,” Livers responded.

“Watch tomorrow. I’ll pop out 

of it.”

But under the bright lights of 

Madison Square Garden, Poole’s 
attempts simply wouldn’t fall, 
finishing with just 13 total 
points over four games.

Last Saturday, however, he 

still hit the shot. All the pressure 
and all the talk of a slump has 
become a distant thought.

But 
now, 
the 
Wolverines 

need a strong Poole to beat 
Texas A&M on Thursday. The 
Aggies thwarted No. 2 seed 
North Carolina’s interior on 
Sunday. The Tar Heels failed 
to open up lanes for slashers 
and opportunties on the block, 
shooting 
an 
abysmal 
6-for-

31 from beyond the arc and 
allowing Texas A&M to advance 
in emphatic fashion.

To 
avoid 
the 
same 
fate, 

Poole and Michigan need to 
knock down 3-pointers — and 
efficiently 
so. 
That 
means 

making those winning plays and 
avoiding heat checks — despite 
the greatness of Poole’s last shot.

And 
to 
his 
credit, 
even 

through all the hype, new 
Instagram 
followers 
and 

celebrity shootouts, Poole seems 
to understand just that.

“(Coach) definitely told me to 

live in the moment, and take it 
all in,” Poole said. “But it’s only 
so long you can do it before you 
move on to the next game.”

The freshman guard has cemented himself in Michigan lore. Now, he and the Wolverines will look to take down Texas A&M

goosebumps ...”

Abdur-Rahkman, Michigan look to solve shooting struggles against Aggies 

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Michigan shot under 40 percent from the floor and 28 percent from deep in the first two games of the NCAA Tournament.

this time of year. The Wolverines 

snuck into the Sweet Sixteen 

despite struggling to score.

If that performance is repeated 

this weekend, they might not be so 
fortunate.

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — There 

are two lines of thinking when a 
good team plays badly.

One is that it’s a problem to be 

taken seriously, because any sort 
of slump in the postseason can 
easily spell doom for a team.

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team, after shooting under 40 
percent from the floor and 28 
percent from deep in two games 
last weekend, has taken the 
second train of thought. The 
Wolverines believe their play, and 
their shooting in particular, will 
regress to the mean eventually.

“We didn’t make them last week, 

but we’ve got to stay encouraged 
and still have that confidence to 
take and make open shots,” said 
senior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman. “That’s what 
we’ve been doing, we haven’t 
really changed anything.”

“We’ve been winning,” added 

sophomore guard Zavier Simpson. 
“We’re on a good winning streak. 
We want to continue what we’ve 
been doing, and hopefully the 
shots fall. We want to make sure 
everybody stays confident, and 
when (the shots) fall, that’s when 
it’s a whole different ballgame.”

For 
Michigan, 
that’s 
the 

positive side of things. Even with 
lackluster shooting numbers, it’s 
still playing basketball because 
of freshman guard Jordan Poole’s 
game-winning 
shot 
against 

Houston.

And to a man, it seems the 

Wolverines are thinking positively 
about their next opportunity to 
break out of their slump against 
Texas A&M on Thursday.

“Zavier takes pride in that,” 

said freshman forward Isaiah 
Livers. “He was like, ‘Dang, we’re 
up two and we’re not even playing 
our best right now,’ at halftime. 
And I was like, ‘Yeah, you’re right, 
X. We’ve just gotta come out and 
play better.’ And that’s why I said I 
was really looking forward to this 
game to see what happened over 
the week and if we’re gonna hit 
that shot or not.”

The 
concerning 
side 
to 

Michigan’s shooting struggles last 
week is that there isn’t a strategic 
change that can be made to fix it. 
The Wolverines got good shots 
against Houston and Montana, 
but they weren’t falling.

Shooting 
is 
variable, 
and 

it’s contagious. When a good 
shot doesn’t go in, there isn’t 
much more to do but shrug your 
shoulders and shoot it again the 
next time. Michigan coach John 
Beilein said as much Wednesday.

“I see us just going to play on,” 

Beilein said. “We were fortunate 
to be here, and we played the best 
basketball we could play. It wasn’t 
as good as some of our other 
games, but that just happens. 
Everybody is always asking for 
reasons why. There is no reason 
why. It just happens. They’re 
19-year-old kids. It just happens.”

So what do you do in practice 

the next week to improve you 
shooting? You shoot.

At least with that, according to 

Beilein, there is a silver lining.

“Yesterday, we did our shooting 

drills, and it was the highest 
numbers we’ve ever gotten as 
a team as far as our shooting 
drill,” Beilein said at his press 
conference Tuesday. “It was just a 
five-minute shooting drill, but the 
lowest guy had 55 threes in five 
minutes, and that was the lowest 
guy. And the standard used to be 
50 until we became good at it, and 
now it’s 60. Of our 12 players, 10 
got 60.”

And there is the confidence 

again. Every Michigan player and 
coach says that the shooting woes 
won’t continue. After all, this is 
the same team whose offense lit 
up Madison Square Garden to win 
the Big Ten Tournament.

But they’d better be right. The 

margin for error is much less

Walk-ons take in March Madness

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — C.J. 

Baird was enamored with his 
surroundings.

The 
walk-on 
freshman 

continually scanned his locker 
up and down, jimmied his feet 
through his white Jordans and 
sent Snapchats of the covered 
nameplate beside his own name 
at the top — it belonged to Los 
Angeles Clippers forward Danilo 
Gallinari. The scene was an image 
custom-fit to a childhood dream.

While 
reporters 
swarmed 

the typical starters, Baird and 
his

teammates — Luke Wilson, Rico 
Ozuna-Harrison and Naji Ozeir — 
stood up from their quiet corner 
and surveyed the room to find the 
lockers of Lou Williams and Tobias 
Harris, two of their numerous NBA 
inspirations.

The 
wide-eyed 
walk-ons 

weren’t surrounded by cameras 
and voice recorders. The meager 
foot traffic by their lockers wasn’t 
a surprise, though — they aren’t 
going to see the floor for Thursday’s 
Sweet Sixteen matchup against 
Texas A&M. Even for their first 
road trip of the season last weekend 
in Wichita, the NCAA Tournament 
aura of InTrust Bank Arena wasn’t 
the most jaw-dropping spot to be — 
Ozeir justified it as having a role in 
“the bigger picture.”

But 
now 
in 
Los 
Angeles, 

practicing for a Tournament game 
under the storied Staples Center 
rafters, the newly-travelled walk-
ons are understanding what it 
feels like to hit the road and get 
star treatment as members of one 
of the highest ranked teams in the 
country. You can’t blame them for 
having trouble taking it in stride.

“We’re all in awe and taking 

everything in and they’re just like 
‘Yeah, this is what you do when 
you travel,’ ” Baird said. “It makes 
us feel more welcome and more 
accepted.”

Accepted 
is 
the 
operative 

word here. The freshmen admit 

not travelling with the team 
throughout the season can lead to 
an isolated nature. They didn’t even 
know until just after the Big Ten 
Tournament that they would get 
to come with the team for March 
Madness. Ozuna-Harrison even 
said some of his teammates had 
to calm his nerves before the first 
flight.

Their dedication, of course, 

doesn’t go unnoticed on the team. 
Coach John Beilein lightheartedly 
labels them and junior forward 
Brent Hibbitts the “Fab Five” that 
compose the scout team. With an 
upcoming date against a lengthy, 
athletic Aggies team that boasts 
three starters 6-foot-9 or taller, it 
is up to the scout team — none of 
which are taller than 6-foot-8 — to 
do what they’ve done all season and 
emulate their opponent.

“It’s definitely a bigger role, 

mimicking the other person,” Ozeir 
said. “Just trying to do what they 
do. They’re a much bigger team 
so the emphasis is guarding post 
players.”

Added Ozuna-Harrison: “You 

always know exactly what the 
other team does. Being a guard, 
and we’re not playing a team that 
has guards that take a whole lot of 
shots, we know to just give it to the 
post. Stuff like that, we know our 
personnel.”

With a difficult opponent for the 

most high-stakes challenge of the 
season, they do the dirty work no 
one else wants to do. It’s a position 
vital to the team’s success, and 
another reason to celebrate their 
presence at the tournament.

“Everybody was excited (they 

were coming),” said senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman. 
“They put so much into it, as much 
as we do. They don’t get any credit 
for it and you don’t see what they 
do. They definitely deserve to come 
on the trips and definitely deserve 
everything that we get.”

Off the court, Michigan hardly 

gives itself time for other activities. 
In “the spirit of staying focused,” 
according to Baird, their time is 
spent playing Xbox or eating meals 
together. Time for yourself isn’t 
really an option on a trip like this, 
which is why at least two players 
volunteer every trip to bring a game 
console. The walk-ons were always 
familiar with this ritual — another 
small gesture that makes the trip 
that much more special for them.

Unlike Wilson and Ozeir, Baird 

and Ozuna-Harrison were added 
to the roster after the beginning of 
the University’s fall semester. But 
needless to say, it didn’t matter how 
long they had been with the team. 
Baird’s disbelief in getting this far 
echoed the group’s mentality.

“Never could’ve dreamed,” he 

said, “of anything this good.”

Michigan beats CMU, 5-0, in home opener

First it was a trickle. Then it was 

a flood.

For the No. 17 Michigan softball 

team (23-6 overall), the first five 
innings of Wednesday’s home 
opener against Central Michigan 
— an eventual 5-0 win — seemed 
to be the same story ad nauseam. A 
hard-hit ball that found a glove. An 
infield single erased on a double 
play. A shot that looked destined 
for the seats, only to die on the 
warning track.

Rinse. Repeat.
Until the floodgates opened.
At first, the game was a pitcher’s 

duel between senior right-hander 
Tera Blanco and the Chippewas’ 
Taylor Weaver. Both pitchers 
faced the minimum through three 
innings. The lone baserunner for 
either team — a swinging-bunt 
single by sophomore outfielder 
Haley 
Hoogenraad 
— 
was 

promptly erased when junior 
catcher Katie Alexander lined into 
a double play.

“They’re just extra pumped, 

they’re extra excited to be at home, 
and I worry about the distraction,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. “ … I thought we were 
anxious a little bit at the plate, 
trying too hard and we weren’t 
very relaxed.”

The fourth inning provided 

some hope for the Wolverines. 
Junior second baseman Faith 
Canfield led off with a walk and 
junior centerfielder Natalie Peters 
followed with an infield single. 
Blanco stepped up to the plate and 
launched a long, arcing fly ball. 
The crowd held their collective 
breaths, but the wind — a cold, 
gusty breeze that blew straight in 
for the majority of the game — had 
other plans. What could have been 
a game-defining home run was 
instead a routine flyout.

And in the fifth, Michigan’s 

pitching — which had kept it in the 
game up to that point — sprung a 
leak. Hutchins, wanting to get all 
her pitchers a look in front of the 
home crowd, removed a dealing 

Blanco for freshman left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien. But Beaubien 
wasn’t herself. First she gave up a 
leadoff double. Then she stopped 
throwing strikes.

Though Beaubien got a quick 

out on a popped-up bunt, she got 
to a 3-0 count on the next hitter 
before forcing a groundout. With 
the following two batters, she 
wasn’t as lucky. Both drew walks.

Hutchins had enough. She 

called Blanco back 
into the circle.

“I 
think 

Beaubien 
just 

kind of felt off,” 
Hutchins 
said. 

“And I think she 
let that affect her 
a little bit. … She 
never really got 
a chance to get 
going.”

But 
Blanco 

came in pumped up. She had been 
lights-out all game and this time 
was no different. The next batter 
hit a chopper right to Canfield. 
Inning over.

And just as Blanco had flipped 

the switch off for the Chippewas, 
she flipped it on for the Wolverines.

With runners on first and 

second in the bottom of the sixth, 
Blanco launched a ball deep to 
center. This time, there was no 
leather in sight as the ball dropped 

for a double that made the score 
1-0.

“All 
the 
game 
we 
just 

needed that one hit that started 
everything,” Canfield said. “It 
gave everyone confidence and I 
mean … one leads to another and 
another and another.”

Indeed, one hit led to another 

(a two-RBI double by sophomore 
third baseman Madison Uden) and 
another (a single from freshman 

designated 
player Lou Allan 
that 
brought 

Uden 
home) 

and another (a 
double down the 
left-field line to 
move runners to 
second and third 
with only one 
out).

By the time 

the parade had 

ended, the Wolverines had scored 
five runs, and suddenly a tense 
duel was anything but.

“It was just a matter of time,” 

Blanco said. “ … We came through 
at the end.”

Ten pitches from freshman 

right-hander Sarah Schaefer later, 
the side was retired. The game 
was over.

And the struggles that had 

seemed so potent until the sixth 
had been washed away.

“It was just a 

matter of time. 

We came through 

at the end.”

In women’s athletics, Rosen has seen transformative changes

In observance of Women’s History 

Month, The Daily launches a series 
aimed at telling the stories of female 
athletes, coaches and teams at the 
University from the perspective of 
the female sports writers on staff. 
Daily sports editor Paige Voeffray 
continues the series with this story.

Mark Rosen is a man living in a 

woman’s world. When he started 
his career, he was faced with a 
choice: stick to what was familiar 
and coach men’s sports, or venture 
to the women’s game. Choosing the 
latter, he has seen first-hand the 
struggles female college athletes 
face: Lack of crowds, lack of 
funding and lack of respect.

Many others would have stuck 

with the men.

But Rosen grew fond of coaching 

women. He’s been the Michigan 
women’s volleyball coach for 19 
seasons now.

“I think they’re way more 

coachable,” said Rosen. “They’re 
way more willing to listen. There 
are some personality differences 
that I think are really unique that 
I really like the side of women’s 
personalities. They really take 
to heart wanting feedback and 
wanting to get better.

“I think you spend more time 

with women trying to convince 
them that they’re better than they 
think they are, and guys you spend 
more time convincing them they’re 
not as good as they think they are.”

Before his tenure as a coach, 

Rosen never would have dreamed 
of being a women’s volleyball coach, 
let alone a volleyball coach at all.

After growing up an avid hockey 

player 
in 
Anchorage, 
Alaska, 

Rosen knew that he wanted to 
coach when his playing days were 
over. Throughout high school 
and the beginning of college, 
Rosen realized that his hobby of 
playing volleyball was something 
much more than that. So, he took 
his talents to California State 
University at Northridge to try his 
hand as a Division I varsity men’s 
volleyball player.

Combining his desire to be 

a coach and natural volleyball 
IQ, Rosen became a student of 
the game and, after 26 years of 

coaching, it has surely paid off.

***
Rosen’s 
first 
coaching 

experience was back where it all 
began — his former high school. 
He never worried that he wouldn’t 
understand the different playing 
styles or how to coach women, 
because he was too busy simply 
trying to learn how to coach, 
period.

As 
Rosen 
eventually 
left 

high school volleyball to pursue 
a coaching career at a more 
competitive 
level, 
he 
never 

ventured to the men’s game. In 
part, it has to do with the number 
of programs — there are over 1,000 
NCAA women’s volleyball teams, 
while the men have yet to break 
100. But even though Rosen was a 
player himself, there’s something 
about the women’s game that 
speaks to him.

“I like the women’s game more 

because it’s more rally oriented 
and more defensively oriented, 
whereas the men’s is more just raw 
power,” Rosen said. “I don’t even 
like watching the guys’ games. … 

It’s entertaining, but to me it’s not 
as tactically intriguing because it’s 
just more physical — set the best 
player, he gets up and gets a kill, 
rally over.

“In the women’s game, I think 

there’s way more tactics and way 
more adjustments you can make 
and things you can do to tactically 
be involved in the game.”

The style of play is truly the only 

difference Rosen 
sees 
between 

the 
men’s 
and 

women’s 
games. 

In fact, he believes 
thinking of them 
differently 
is 
a 

problem of its own.

At 
the 
end 

of the day, his 
athletes want to 
compete and win. 
He disregards the 
characterization that there will be 
more drama, and social lives are 
more important than the sport just 
because they’re women. Rosen was 
a player himself, and he can recall 
plenty of drama and “guys that 

wanted to beat the heck out of each 
other” on his team.

It’s not specific to women’s 

sports. It’s specific to being an 
athlete.

***
Just because Rosen views men’s 

and women’s sports the same, 
doesn’t 
mean 
everyone 
does. 

Rosen has had a front row seat to 
the struggles women’s sports have 

been through, but 
he credits those 
that came before 
him for why his 
volleyball 
team 

is at the level it is 
today.

He 
recalls 

softball 
coach 

Carol 
Hutchins, 

before she was the 
winningest coach 
in NCAA softball 

history, when she held a second job 
as the athletic director’s assistant. 
Sure, she was the head softball 
coach at a huge public school, but 
she would spend her evenings 
raking her own fields while she 

watched an entire grounds crew 
take care of the baseball field. But 
the dues she paid paved the way 
for the next generation.

He recalls Bev Plocki applied 

for three gymnastics coaching 
jobs. One for a Division III school, 
one for a Division II school and 
the other at Michigan. She didn’t 
get the other jobs and has been the 
Wolverines’ coach for 29 seasons. 
It is suspected she was offered 
the job because they thought she 
wouldn’t make waves, but instead 
they got a coach who hasn’t been 
afraid to speak her mind and 
has been a champion for women 
athletes. 

With the introduction of Title 

IX, women’s programs began 
establishing themselves across 
the country. Progress was slow, 
but it was happening. As each new 
generation sees powerful women 
athletes, the stigma surrounding 
them will disappear. Rosen still 
has friends that are shocked to 
hear how much time his athletes 
spend in the weight room, on the 
track and with a dietician.

His athletes are all in and are 

committed to being the best, and 
it’s time people started seeing that.

“My mom is a super competitive 

person, but she couldn’t be an 
athlete because there was no 
opportunity for her. I didn’t look 
at her when I was a kid as, ‘Hey 
there’s my mom, the athlete and 
competitive 
person,’ 
” 
Rosen 

said. “Well then there’s my wife 
(associate head volleyball coach 
Leisa Rosen), who was an All-
American, she was a scholarship 
athlete, she was a Big Ten Player 
of the Year, she was the Ohio State 
Athlete of the Year, she’s in the 
Hall of Fame.

“My kids are so much more in 

tune with and proud of her athletic 
career than mine. … They’ll brag 
about Leisa, and think about how 
cool that is that we have two guys 
that see their mom as an athlete.”

Women’s sports have come so 

far in such a short amount of time, 
and Rosen only sees their success 
increasing in the future.

“The men’s sports have had a 

75-year head start. Michigan really 
didn’t take women’s athletics 
seriously really until the mid-80s, 
maybe the late-80s. They’ve only 
been really committed to it for 
30-40 years versus the men side’s 
been (committed for) 150 years,” 
Rosen said. “Are we catching 
up and are we making moves? I 
absolutely think so.

“It’s so exciting to see where 

volleyball’s going and I try to 
project ahead and think, ‘What 
about 25 years from now? What 
will it be like?’ I honestly believe 
there will be pro leagues, I 
honestly believe there will be 
more and more sold-out venues 
and we will be making revenue. 
That’s totally conceivable to me. 
(Men’s athletics) just had a head 
start.”

The future of volleyball is still 

unknown, just as the future of 
women’s sports is unknown. But 
if Rosen has any control of the 
future, change is coming. He sees 
dedicated fans that are hooked on 
volleyball, he sees packed arenas 
for games and he sees an increase 
in quality female coaches.

But 
most 
importantly, 
he 

sees a future without stigma 
surrounding women’s athletics.

technology and music.
“It’s 
really 
hard 
to 
say, 
because every time I get exposed 
to something new in PAT, I 
gravitate towards it,” Cox said. 
“Every day, what I see myself 
doing in the future is different. 
It’s really hard to decide what 
you want to do, because every 
day 
music 
technology 
and 
performance arts technology is 
growing and its exponential. It’s 
not going to stop.”
This year’s student showcase 
will be a single example of 
the expansive work that PAT 
students are doing, which could 
be viewed as the most recent 
culmination of several years of 
art and technology developing 
alongside 
one 
another. 
According 
to 
Department 
Chair Michael Gurevich, these 
developments can be boiled 
down to two major factors, the 
first being an immense growth 
in computing power.
“When I was starting out, you 
could barely kind of process and 
manipulate sound on a computer 
live, in real time,” Gurevich said. 
“Now, your watch or your phone 

can do that. So just the sheer 
computing power has created 
the possibility that anyone’s 
phone, computer (and) lots of 
mobile computing devices are 
basically 
powerful 
recording 
studios 
of 
powerful 
simple 
processes. So that means that 
anyone can do it, and anyone has 
the access to really sophisticated 
tools.”
Gurevich has been active in 
the field of performance arts 
technology for about 20 years. 
Another factor that has led to 
an increase in innovation in this 
field, he said, is the Internet.
“The second thing is the 
possibility 
that 
using 
the 
internet 
as 
a 
medium 
for 
music-making 
has 
made 
so 
the possibility of now not just 
recording, producing one’s own 
music, but distributing it online,” 
Gurevich said. “But then also the 
possibility of collaborating with 
people in distant locations who 
you’ve never met — and we can 
do that live now, too. So one of 
our interests in our department 
at Michigan is what we call 
telematics, so the possibility 
of playing live with people in 
distant locations.”
The PAT program at the 
University 
specifically 
has 
risen to meet the occasion. 
One of the things that makes 
the department here stand out 
is that the program is highly 
undergraduate-focused; 
By 
Gurevich’s estimate, as many as 
98 percent of PAT students are 
undergraduates.
“Music technology, which is 
really what our department is 
primarily about, tends to be a 
field that really, in most schools, 
exists primarily at the graduate 
level,” 
Gurevich 
said. 
“And 
that’s because in order to work 
in this field, you need to know 
a lot about music, you need to 
know a lot about technology and 
you need to also have put some 
thought into how those two 
things go together … So we’re 
pretty unique in that respect, 
in that we start out in a really 
challenging field, from day one, 
with undergraduate students.”
The department is also unique 
because of its sheer breadth: 
There 
are 
nine 
full-time 
faculty members, with focuses 
encompassing composition, film 
music, visual media, recording, 
sound engineering and more. 
All of the faculty and their 
classes share a commitment to 
prioritizing creativity through a 
technological lens.
“What we try to do, always, 
is to keep the aesthetic and the 
creative aspects of what we’re 

doing front and center in all of 
our classes … What we try to do 
is not focus on technology for its 

own sake, but instead to try to 
always be asking what are the 
creative consequences and the 
creative or artistic possibilities 
of a particular technique or 
a 
particular 
technology,” 
Gurevich said.
The classes accomplish this 
often through assigning project-
based work, and assignments 
where “as soon as students learn 
something, they’re starting to 
make music with it.” The world 
of performance arts technology 
is rapidly evolving, and judging 
by the pace of the department 
and the wide variety of projects 
being undertaken by its students, 
the University’s PAT program is 
more than prepared to keep up.
“Historically, a lot of new 
technologies 
have 
actually 
emerged 
from 
artistic 
motivations. At the same time, 
artists have always been kind 
of 
voracious 
consumers 
of 
technologies, and as soon as a 
new technology emerges, artists 
are using it to try to push art 
forward. And I think that exists 
in music, it exists in visual art, 
in architecture, in almost any 
creative field,” Gurevich said. 
“So I think they’ve always been 
intertwined, and that’ll probably 
always be the case.”

Performance Arts Technology and 
the limitless potential of tech & art

Moore’s law postulates the 
capabilities of technology double 
every two years and will continue 
to do so indefinitely. The logical 
base of this projection into the 
future has been disputed, but 
regardless its central idea is 
true: Technology does not stop. 
This 
characteristic 
is 
what 
makes the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance’s Performance 
Arts Technology department 
so interesting, as the challenge 
for students is to chase this 
technological trend through art.
The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 
PAT 
students 
about 
the 
unique characteristics of the 
University’s 
program 
that 
facilitate the marriage between 
art and technology as well as the 
intrinsic innovation within the 
major.
Fee Christoph, an interarts 
performance 
and 
computer 
science major, took both PAT 
201 and PAT 498. In PAT 201, 
Christoph was exposed to the 
processes behind the creation 
of electronic music and some 
history about the genre.
“In the class itself, what I 
really enjoyed was that it wasn’t 
just a focus on learning (PAT) 
skills, but a lot of it was also about 
thinking about electronic music 
and the debates it presents and 
understanding 
philosophically 
what 
it 
means 
for 
these 
different music movements to be 
happening,” Christoph said.
Her PAT 498 experience was 
slightly different: “PAT 201 was 
a studio class where we were 
making more music, and then 
in PAT 498 we were learning all 
about this awesome electronic 
music.”
In 
PAT 
498, 
Christoph 
learned the scope of electronic 
music in a social context, as 
her professor revealed to the 
students many artists working at 
the fringe of technology-driven 
music, especially women and 
minorities innovating in a genre 
historically dominated by white 
men.
“The easiest gate into the 
history of electronic music is 
through a lot of white male 
composers, so it was really 
cool to have a class that was 
like, ‘Hey, there are also a 
ton of women composers and 
minority composers who are 
doing amazing work currently,’” 
Christoph said.
Classes in PAT often examine 
artistic innovation in the context 
of history, a focus which has 
offered its students a broader 
perspective on the possibilities 
that 
technology 
offers. 
In 
another interview, PAT major 
and 
independent 
singer-
songwriter Johanna Baumann 
expanded on the importance of 
this innovation.
“If we’re talking about history, 

going back to, let’s say, the 1900s 
… people were going back to the 
classical stuff, but there were 
also other people who were like, 
‘No, we’re not going to go there. 
We’re going to do new things. 
We’re going to mess around with 
records and later tape, and cut 
stuff up, and make crazy stuff 
that doesn’t sound like music to 
anyone.’ Yet. But now it sounds 
like music to us,” Baumann said.
According 
to 
Baumann, 
this 
pattern 
has 
continued 
throughout many of the major 
technological advancements of 
the last century, all the way up 
to the present day.
“People were making music 
with computers as soon as 
computers started to become 
a 
thing,” 
she 
said. 
“Even 
before that, people were using 
technology in music in creative 
ways … Technology and art 
develop alongside each other 
and enhance each other, because 
technology without art would 
be super boring. And then art 
without technology would be 
more limited.”
As a PAT student, Baumann is 
often seeking out creative ways 
to explore this intersection. She 
interned last year at Moogfest, 
a festival focused on music and 
technology, and just released 
an 
original 
album 
in 
Feb. 
The album, Peach, consists of 
eight tracks, some of which 
were recorded as projects in 
PAT recording classes. Last 
year, Baumann received the 
Hedy 
Lamarr 
Achievement 
Award for Emerging Leaders 
in Entertainment Technology, 
presented 
by 
the 
Digital 
Entertainment Group. As she 
pointed out in our conversation, 
she is only one example: “PAT 
majors are doing big things.”
“If you just know the technical 
basics, you’re not going to be 
able to solve problems as well 
as if you know the creative 
aspects,” Baumann said. “Say 
you’re helping a musician, and 
they have some kind of problem 
… You know the technology of 
what’s going to work, and then 
you also know, aesthetically 
and musically, what’s going to 
sound good. So I think having 
the creative experience really 
enhances being an engineer. 
Because you’re an artist, too, so 
you can help the artist.”
Baumann’s 
newest 
project 
is her senior thesis, a sound 
installation to be put up in the 
Chip Davis Technology Studio 
of the Earl V. Moore Building. 
The 
student 
showcase 
day 
for all senior theses will take 
place April 13. Baumann’s own 
installation, Mood Room, will 
be a curtained-off section of 
the room with stations that 
generate music algorithmically 
using participants’ heart rate, 
temperature and conductance.
“I’m 
trying 
to 
estimate 
people’s moods and play music 
that reflects the mood of the 
room, and then also have colored 
lights and stuff. It’s like a mood 
ring, but a room,” Baumann said.
Ryan 
Cox, 
a 
Daily 
Arts 
Writer and former saxophone 
performance major, explained 

his initial draw to PAT was the 
program’s diversity of interests 
and lack of rigidity that mirrored 
the limitlessness of technology.
“One of the things that I really 
liked about the PAT program 
here especially was how diverse 
is actually was,” Cox said. “They 
didn’t have a specific focus, but 
it was kind of what you made 
of it. I’ve had friends graduate 
here who are now recording 
engineers in L.A. I’ve had 
friends graduate here who are 
now working for digital audio 
workstations and coding for 
them. It’s really as technical or 
as creative as you want it to be.”
For example, Cox mentioned 
that for his PAT application, he 
was asked to rearrange a Bach 
fugue with the objective to “be 
as weird and creative as you can 
be.” He merged the fugue with 
“Back to the Future” themes, 
titling his piece, “Bach to the 
Future,” 
checking 
both 
the 
weird and creative boxes.
Cox 
also 
spoke 
on 
the 
controversy 
regarding 
the 
combination 
of 
music 
and 
technology in general. While 
there is certainly merit to the 
claim 
technology’s 
influence 
in music has the potential 
to 
transform 
warm, 
analog 
sounds into digital, inauthentic 
computations, Cox sided with 
the computers. To him, the 
influx of technology in art 
opens up many more doors than 
it closes, especially when the 
proper balance between natural 
and artificial is struck.
“I’m all for the incorporation 
of 
technology 
in 
music,” 
Cox said. “I think it’s really 
important because of how many 
boundaries it alleviates. It’s 
really cool to have a combination 
of analog sounds and more 
digital, abstract sounds that 
you wouldn’t be able to actually 
create. I think that’s stimulating 
for the listener because they’ll 
hear these things that are man-
made, and then they’ll hear 
these things that aren’t natural.”
Cox posited this stimulating 
blend of electronic and organic 
sounds is what drives pop 
and hip-hop music today, as 
electronically engineered beats 
are often paired with a natural, 
familiar voice.
Sticking with the topic of the 
benefits technology brings to art, 
our conversation shifted toward 
the music industry. Today, with 
the advent of label-less streaming 
services like SoundCloud and 
Bandcamp, amateur musicians 
can independently make the 
leap into the professional world 
with simply a microphone, a 
digital audio workstation and 
a computer. This progression 
not only makes the creation and 
promotion of music infinitely 
easier for the artist, but it also 
exposes so much art to the 
listener that would go either 
uncreated 
or 
undiscovered 
without technology.
When 
asked 
about 
his 
focus 
and 
future 
in 
PAT, 
Cox gave a response in line 
with 
the 
information 
he’d 
already 
provided

the 
ever-changing 
landscape

Johanna Bauman discusses the PAT program.

From developing car parts to 
making sculptures, 3D printing 
and scanning technologies are 
changing the way we create.
The 
Groundworks 
Fabrication 
Studio, 
located 
in 
the 
Duderstadt 
Center, 
offers students the chance 
to work with 3D printing 
and 
scanning 
technologies. 
Staff at Groundworks assist 
students with the printing of 
their projects, giving advice 
on which specific printer to 
use and helping create the 
file. 
Stephanie 
O’Malley, 
Interactive 
Imaging 
and 
Production 
Specialist 
at 
Groundworks, creates content 
for a variety of grant funded 
projects across the schools 
associated with the University.
“These grants can involve 
3D content for augmented 
or virtual reality platforms, 
animation 
or 
illustrations 
and span very diverse fields, 
from medical or engineering 
to 
art 
and 
architecture,” 
O’Malley wrote in an email 
interview 
with 
The 
Daily. 
“Because Groundworks at the 
Duderstadt Center is an open 
resource to all of the University 
of Michigan, we see a lot of 
cross-pollination 
between 
students from different fields 
which can lead to some very 
interesting projects.”

O’Malley has seen many 
student projects, and some 
of the most interesting to 
her have been when students 
3D scan themselves to print 
miniatures or to paper craft 
armatures. Others use the 
data to CNC route (a computer 
controlled cutter) to cut large 
foam statues.
“I think the most intriguing 
art projects that utilize 3D 
printing are those that make 
smart use of the technology 
to do things that haven’t been 
done before or can’t be done 
with 
traditional 
means 
of 
fabricating,” O’Malley wrote. 
“I am also always excited to 
see other technologies feed 
into the 3D printing process.”
However, 
O’Malley 
has 
noticed some restrictions with 
the 3D printers, especially 
because 
they 
require 
that 
the artist have the technical 
knowledge 
that 
goes 
into 
making the CAD (computer 
aided design program) model 
of the project they want to 
print.
“I would like to see these 
technologies 
become 
more 
artist-friendly,” 
O’Malley 
wrote. 
“3D 
printers 
are 
restricted in many ways that 
artists have to design around. 
A lot of people have the 
expectation that a 3D printer 
should work as seamlessly 
as a paper printer, and I see 
a lot of companies trying to 
progress 
toward 
achieving 

that experience.”
O’Malley herself started out 
in the video game industry, 
working 
on 
cross-platform 
game development for XBox, 
Playstation and Wii. She now 
finds working at the University 
to be a way to blend her 
background with her interest 
in cutting edge technologies 
and virtual reality platforms.
When O’Malley looks to the 
future of 3D technologies and 
art, she hopes for improvement 
from both the artistic side 
as well as the technical side, 
because while 3D technology 
is used to create art, art skills 
are used to transform science 
and engineering projects from 
an idea to reality.
“In 3D visualization we 
see a lot of rough diagrams 
and other visuals that are 
constructed by scientists or 
engineers, 
and 
they 
often 
lack the aesthetic to make 
them look professional but 
also the visual cues that tell 
the viewer what is important 
or how to travel coherently 
through the data,” O’Malley 
wrote. “It takes a very skilled 
artist 
to 
reinterpret 
this 
kind of complicated data in a 
more coherent way. I would 
like to see artists that are 
more adaptive to this visual 
language, 
but 
also 
more 
people seeking visualizations 
who realize the importance 
of a strong aesthetic when 
communicating their ideas.”

There’s no doubt we are 
living in an age of screens, and 
books have not been spared in 
the relentless transfer of text 
to electronic devices. Is this a 
bad thing? How have writers 
grappled 
with 
the 
impacts 
of 
technology 
on 
human 
connection, 
communication 
and interaction?
Sweetland lecturer Simone 
Sessolo studies how technology 
shapes the way we write and 
think. His take on digital media 
is refreshingly nuanced.
“Let’s not start by being 
evaluative,” 
said 
Sessolo. 
“Let’s start by observing and 
describing.”
The software of e-reading 
is perhaps more important to 
consider than the hardware. 
E-readers have become less 
popular in recent years; apps 
that users can download on 
their phones and computers are 
more convenient and usually 
free, even when the content 
itself is not.
“There’s 
an 
enhanced 
attention 
to 
multimodality,” 
Sessolo explained.
Technology 
means 
there 
is no longer an inexorable 
connection between object and 
content. Sessolo held up a book 
and demonstrated, explaining 
he could read that book on his 
laptop, his phone or an e-reader. 
The physical book, once central 
to obtaining knowledge, is now 
one of many means through 
which readers and writers can 
communicate.
The relocation of print books 
to digital mediums does mean 
something is lost, however. 
The Daily chatted with English 
Professor Joshua Miller, and 
he described an experience 
that, for him, reinforced the 
possibility for connection and 
coincidence that physical books 
allow.
“I had this very strange 
experience 
in 
college 
that 
I 
think 
probably 
can’t 
be 
reproduced anymore,” Miller 
said. “I was in the library, 
browsing through the stacks. 
I just randomly picked up a 
novel, and I decided to take it 
to the checkout desk. I was on 
the way there and the old call 
slip card fell out of the book 
so I reached down to pick it 
up — and there was my father’s 
name, in his handwriting, from 
when he was a graduate student 
20 years earlier. That’s the kind 
of thing that won’t happen once 
we’re fully digital.”
Miller, though enthusiastic 
about 
the 
possibilities 
for 
creativity 
that 
technology 
allows, 
still 
has 
some 
reservations.
“One thing that I think gets 
lost a little bit is the book as a 
curated object,” Miller said. 
“The publisher and the editors 
— and the author, if they’re 
lucky — get to make decisions 
about how the book comes 
together — in terms of a unique 
font, hardcover or softcover, 
creative typography, whether 
or not to include drawings or 
images, the texture of the paper, 
how raised or how smooth and 
matte or glossy. That doesn’t 
always happen with digital 
material.”
Miller is also a margin-note 
enthusiast.
“All of the books I have on 
my bookshelves I keep in part 
because they have my notes in 
them. As a piece of technology, 
the paper book is very good at 
storing 
information,” 
Miller 
said. “That data doesn’t get 
lost unless I lose the book, 
and no digital format has fully 
succeeded in convincing me I 
can reproduce that.”
Miller continued to clarify 
his use of reading technology.
“I think we’re all still figuring 
out what (e-readers) can and 
can’t do,” Miller explained. “I 
do have some concerns about 
the shift from analog to digital 
and what it means. We lose a lot 
when we give up the material 
book.”
Still, Miller isn’t by any 

means 
opposed 
to 
new 
technologies.
“I use screen reading apps, 
and I love them. It allows me to 
buy a book and read it quickly, 
so that’s really helpful … there’s 
a lot of benefits to it,” Miller 
said. “I’m excited about the 
opportunities and possibilities 
of new technologies, and I’m 
trying to distinguish between 
the changes that feel profound 
to me and the changes that feel 
incremental — and determine 
what I think about each of those 
different kinds of changes, 
because both are there.”
Another important aspect of 
reading technology is the issues 
it raises regarding accessibility. 
Sessolo noted in many ways, 
technology has broken down 
barriers between writers and 
readers and thus democratized 
access to books. Those who 
don’t 
live 
near 
bookstores 
or libraries and people with 
various 
disabilities 
clearly 
benefit from the ability to read 
using a screen; however, while 
technology has the potential 
to radically improve access 
to written material, it’s also 
important 
to 
consider 
the 
price 
of 
technology, 
which 
can exclude those who cannot 
afford to buy e-books, e-readers 
or other devices.
“Technology in and of itself 
is not enough,” Sessolo said.
While 
technology 
is 
promising 
in 
many 
ways, 
working toward economic and 
social equality in all aspects 
of life is still necessary in 
order to fulfill the potential of 
alternative reading mediums. 
“The thing I’d like people 
to consider is that democracy 
only exists in action,” Sessolo 
explained. “To democratize the 
experience of new technology, 
get involved with whatever you 
can.”
Miller 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
accessibility 
when considering multimedia 
works.
“Publishers 
are 
understandably 
concerned 
about losing readers who require 
accessibility or are sympathetic 
to the politics of accessibility,” 
Miller 
said. 
“There’s 
class 
issues too — writers are often 
writing about the precarity 
of everyday life and scenes of 
crisis, so they want to reach the 
widest audience possible and 
engage the issues that they’re 
describing. They don’t want 
to write a novel that can’t be 
checked out of the library.”
How have writers addressed 
and used technology in their 
work?
“I think authors are adjusting 
slowly,” Miller said. “There are 
some writers who have found 
digital platforms and e-books 
to be a natural fit or work really 
well with pre-existing forms. 
Now there’s Twitter fiction and 
things like that, but the divide 
in technology between turning 
books into digital forms and 
digitally-born books is still 
pretty firm. My guess is that 
more and more writers will 
figure out how to use these 
technologies digitally.”
Associate English Professor 
Madhumita Lahiri noted in an 
interview with The Daily that 
short-form writing lends itself 
to incorporating slang, emojis 
and abbreviations. The long 
publishing process for novels 
often means quick cultural 
changes 
render 
words 
and 
phrases obsolete, even if the 
author was innovative a few 
years earlier.
“I think it’s easier if you 
know it’s going to be published 
in the next week,” Lahiri said. 
“The thing that’s tricky about 
emojis in particular is that 
their meanings are extremely 
unstable.”
Miller talked about the rise 
of 
short-form 
writing 
and 
reading apps.
“The number four app in 
the book section of the iOS app 
store is Hooked,” Miller said. 
“It’s a storytelling platform 
that allows authors to tell 
captivating stories in a really 
short form as a series of text 
messages.”

Still, 
there’s 
a 
cultural 
pushback against shorter forms 
of narrative.
“The micro of culture has 
been maligned by people who 
have said attention spans have 
gone down, which I think is 
exaggerating a true fact too 
much,” Miller explained. “The 
shift from a book to a machine 
to apps on other devices does 
increase 
the 
likelihood 
of 
distraction and I think makes 
it much harder to stay focused. 
On the other hand, I think 
the emphasis on short-form 
storytelling isn’t necessarily a 
bad thing.”
While there are many long-
form novels that interrogate 
the 
role 
of 
technology 
in 
modern life, there are fewer 
that 
actually 
incorporate 
technology as part of the 
reading experience.
“There are a lot of works 
describing 
technology 
in 
relatively analog formats, so I 
don’t know when the tipping 
point is going to happen and 
people are going to figure 
out how exactly to make that 
work,” Miller said. “There are 
definitely people who are using 
text language or acronyms —
people are thinking and writing 
about speech and language 
issues.”
The 
ways 
technology 
has changed language is a 
source of cultural anxiety. Is 
technology disintegrating the 
very foundations of language? 
Sessolo 
doesn’t 
think 
so, 
particularly because slang isn’t 
a 21st century creation.
“We’re talking about these 
abbreviations with the feeling 
that they’re new,” Sessolo said. 
“But if we look into stenography, 
that’s what stenographers have 
been doing for a long time.”
Combining text with other 
media such as photographs or 
paintings is also not new. In 
fact, the practice goes back 
hundreds of years.
“Some pages (of medieval 
books) look like the homepage 
of a website. People have always 
experimented 
with 
design,” 
Sessolo said.
Similarly, the popularity of 
serialized narratives harkens 
back to earlier trends.
“There’s 
a 
19th 
century 
version of serialized fiction that 
was published in newspapers or 
magazine in chapters and then 
only put together as a book 
later,” Miller said.
Lahiri echoed this sentiment.
“When the Dickens novel 
was a serial, it would come out 
on the weekend. You could send 
in some comments, and then the 
next one came out — whether or 
not it was true, people felt that 
they had some input,” Lahiri 
said. “People have always felt 
a certain interactivity with the 
fastest media of their day.”
Lahiri 
also 
stressed 
writers have been integrating 
technology into literature for a 
long time.
“If you back to 18th and 
19th century novels, there’s 
all this stuff that we don’t 
understand that is often about 
specific technical devices — a 
kind of shoe or a kind of lamp.” 
Lahiri said. “When we look 
at 
technological 
references, 
there’s a lot more novel-length 
fiction about technology than 
there is actually incorporating 
it. I think that the kinds of 
expressions used in texting 
would have to work the way 
dialect and slang work in 
literature in general — it would 
have to show us something 
particular about that moment. 
I wonder if part of it is that 
people don’t know what it is 
that we would gain from seeing 
that on the page.”
Given 
the 
fast 
pace 
of 
technological 
innovation 
in the 21st century, this is 
certainly an exciting time to 
be a reader and a writer. Here 
are a few recommendations 
for 
narratives 
and 
novels 
that incorporate or discuss 
technology in unusual and 
meaningful ways.

MIRIAM FRANCISCO
Daily Arts Writer

You may know him as Jay 
Dee, J Dilla or even his given 
name, James Dewitt Yancey, 
but there’s no denying that the 
man with many monikers was 
an undeniable genius. Taking 
part in the mid-’90s hip hop 
and neo-soul boom that crafted 
some of the best music of all 
time, the Detroit producer is 
responsible for bringing funk to 
a new playing field with other 
legends like Q-Tip and Dr. Dre. 
J Dilla revolutionized the genre 
with his incredible take on 
the art of sampling, bringing a 
human touch to the computer-
generated beats of his era.
His hand in the great music 
of the ’90s and early 2000s is 
unmistakable; 
the 
laid-back 
groove of Erykah Badu, De La 
Soul, The Roots, Slum Village, 
A Tribe Called Quest, Common 
and many more owe their unique 
sound to the collaboration of 
Yancey and his singular use of 
sampling and drum machines. 
Dilla’s influence is found in 
almost all of current hip hop, 
living on in the remixes and 
beats of music mainstays from 
Flying Lotus to Kanye West and 
the headphones of millions.
Yancey was born in Detroit 
in 1974, growing up with his 
family’s appreciation for music 
and the deep-rooted traditions 
of his city. According to his 
mother Maureen “Ma Dukes” 
Yancey, her son was musical 
from a young age, playing with 
a Fisher-Price record player for 
hours on end and accumulating 
his first 45s given to him by 
family. This laid the foundation 
for an illustrious career as a 
producer who changed the hip 
hop game, starting with the 
formation of his first group, 
Slum Village, in the final years 
of high school with fellow 
Detroit rappers T3 and Baatin. 
Their first album Fantastic, Vol. 
1 came out in 1996 to critical and 
local acclaim.
This was a stepping stone 
toward 
the 
greater 
Detroit 
hip hop scene, of which he 
became a lasting fixture. His 
friendship 
with 
producer 
Joseph “Amp” Fiddler created 
a 
fruitful 
mentorship 
from 
which Dilla mastered digital 
production and created his 
signature sampling style. From 
there, his talent could be seen 
on albums like The Pharcyde’s 
1995 Labcabincalifornia, which 

are still revered today. That 
style is what sets him apart 
from other producers of his 
era — Dilla threw convention 
to the wind with everything he 
did, learning techniques from 
Amp and building off of them 
towards an incomparable sound 
of his own.
Amp’s influence on a young 
Yancey 
contributed 
to 
his 

affinity and skill for sampling 
and 
drum 
machines 
like 
the MPC (MIDI Production 
Center) in its earliest 60 and 
3000 models, a collaboration 
between Roger Linn and Akai 
which revolutionized digital 
music production by giving 
artists the opportunity to use 
their own samples in lieu of 
preloaded drum sounds like 
those of the Linn Drum. In 
Dilla’s 
last 
interview 
with 
Scratch Magazine before his 
untimely death in 2006, the 
producer claimed that Amp 
encouraged him to learn by use 
and not the manual, saying that 
“(Amp) was like, ‘I’m not going 
to show you to work it. You gotta 
learn on your own.’ He was like, 
‘Don’t use a book.’ Ever since 
this day I never read the books 
to samplers and all of that, I just 
try to learn them.”
This 
on-the-fly 
education 
gave Dilla a creative edge to 
sampling, one of the most 
prominent signatures of his 
work being his disregard for a 
function called quantization, 
which snaps beats to a more 
uniform grid. Instead of using 
quantization 
to 
polish 
his 
production, J Dilla embraced 
the humanity of music-making 
and let the beat take him 
where it wanted to go. Roots 
drummer Ahmir “Questlove” 
Thompson says Dilla’s beat on 
The Pharcyde’s song “Bullshit” 
produced 
the 
most 
“life-
changing moment he’d ever 
had,” which inspired him to 
rethink everything he’d been 

taught as a drummer. In an 
interview with Red Bull Music 
Academy, Questlove said that 
at first listen, Dilla’s beats 
“sounded like the kick drum 
was played by like a drunk 
three-year-old. And I was like, 
‘Are you allowed to do that?’”
This stunned response was 
one of many to Dilla’s unique 
approach to drums and bass, as 
he created a signature low-end 
sound that grooves and flows 
throughout each of his songs. 
His 
work 
with 
production 
groups like The Ummah, in 
which he worked with A Tribe 
Called Quest’s Q-Tip and Ali 
Shaheed Muhammad and hip-
hop supergroup Soulquarians. 
Dilla’s command of sampling did 
not only present in his technical 
skill with machines like the 
MPC, but also an incredible 
knack for sourcing jazz and soul 
records and bringing them to 
new heights.
This 
skill 
for 
creating 
incredibly original music out of 
already existing samples is what 
put Dilla on the map in the first 
place, but also what carries his 
legacy into the present. His last 
album, Donuts, was released 
three days before his death from 
a rare blood disease in 2006, 
and mostly recorded and mixed 
from his hospital room. Despite 
the conditions in which it was 
produced, Donuts is arguably 
J Dilla’s most acclaimed and 
celebrated solo album, a stark 
example of his skill for creating 
instrumental hip hop from 
unique sources and influences.
Some 
have 
argued 
Dilla 
may 
have 
been 
the 
last 
great jazz innovator, as his 
command and creative affinity 
for 
imperfection 
lifted 
his 
music to a level beyond his 
contemporaries. Whatever one 
may think J Dilla stands for 
in the history of hip hop and 
soul, it’s clear that he was a 
revolutionary figure who truly 
shifted how people thought 
about production. Dilla’s use of 
technology to further his art 
is proof of hip hop’s reliance 
on and celebration of digital 
production, but also of what it 
is capable of. Dilla humanized 
the buttons and knobs of his 
machines beyond recognition, 
disregarding norms left and 
right to create a lasting legacy 
which lives on in every track he 
touched. Whatever name you 
know him by, one thing is true 
— that James Dewitt Yancey 
changed the face of hip hop 
forever.

Urban Ministries of Durham,

Though 
technology 
is 
shaping both written content 
and the reading experience 
in 
thought-provoking 
ways, 
it’s hard to predict where 
technological innovation will 
take us next —and what that 
will mean for readers and 
writers.
“Technology 
is 
allowing 
storytelling as an art to happen 
in all sorts of places in really 
interesting ways,” Lahiri said. 
“How that relates to print is 
still something we’re figuring 
out.”

begun to dabble in one of 
video game storytelling’s most 
unique aspects: The ability to 
give players a sense that their 
actions matter to the world of 
the story.
The advent of modern video 
games, however, wouldn’t truly 
begin until the release of Hideo 
Kojima’s “Metal Gear Solid” in 
1998. “Metal Gear” tells the 
story of Snake, a work that 
was so unmistakably different 
from other games being put 
out at the time because of its 
sweeping, cinematic nature. 
The game’s many cutscenes 
offered dynamic, interesting 
“camerawork,” 
alongside 
dramatic voice acting, that lent 
the game a sense of gravity and 
importance that had thus far 
been absent from the medium. 
This would lay the groundwork 
for 
games 
like 
Sony’s 
“Uncharted” series, which has 
been described as playing a 
movie. This signaled one of the 
first times that mainstream 
video gaming had embraced 
its role as a medium capable 
of telling intense, deeply felt 
stories.
The late 2000s and beyond 
would see the beginning of the 
storytelling explosion. Here, 
studios began to experiment 
with the concept of player 
choice. Games like “Metal 
Gear Solid” did important 
work in terms of establishing 
video games as a legitimate 
medium of storytelling, but 
it still seemed as if there was 
little that video games could 
do which other storytelling 
mediums 
couldn’t. 
“Metal 
Gear Solid” could just as easily 
have been a movie; in fact, you 
can watch all of the cutscenes 
spliced together on YouTube 
as a serviceable substitute for 
actually playing the game. 
Unsatisfied with this being 
the benchmark for storytelling 
in 
games, 
developers 
such 
as Telltale Games began to 
create games with alternate 
endings and storylines based 
on choices given to the player. 
These 
games 
seemed 
to 
emulate the choose-your-own-
adventure novels sold to kids in 
elementary school, albeit with 
more adult subject matter.
Cut to the modern day. 

The last couple of years have, 
in my opinion, seen video 
games truly come into their 
own as a medium that can 
tell unique, powerful stories 
which could only be told 
as video games. Games like 
Toby Fox’s “Undertale” and 
Davey Wreden’s “The Stanley 
Parable” come to mind as 
members 
of 
a 
developing 

medium 
that 
almost 
feels 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
1920’s 
literary postmodernism; these 
games dissect what it means 
to be a game. Players can 
exploit glitches, mess with 
game files and more. “The 
Stanley Parable,” for example, 
is a game meant to be restarted 
dozens of times. It has almost 
20 achievable endings, some 
of 
them 
entirely 
random, 
including 
some 
in 
which 
Stanley, the game’s voiceless 
protagonist can either choose 
to comply with or rebel against 
the game’s whimsical British 
narrator. Games like this make 
me think that if Samuel Beckett 
were alive today, he’d be a game 
developer. Wreden’s follow-up 
game, “The Beginner’s Guide,” 
tells the story of his friendship 
with a reclusive game designer 
by walking the player through 
the games his friend made. It’s 
an entirely unique narrative 
structure, a story about an 

artist in which the audience is 
placed inside of their art.
One of the most unique 
offerings I’ve seen has been 
Giant Sparrow’s 2017 release, 
“What 
Remains 
of 
Edith 
Finch.” 
The 
game 
follows 
the titular Edith Finch as she 
explores her now-abandoned 
childhood home and unearths 
generations-old secrets about 
the 
Finch 
family. 
“Edith 
Finch” is the first video game 
I’ve encountered that I can say 
tells a story that could only 
ever work as a video game; it 
makes such creative use of all 
facets of the medium, from its 
interactivity to its non-linear 
narrative to how effortlessly it 
manages to tell a story through 
its environment. The player 
is left to wander aimlessly 
through this massive house 
and, 
through 
discovery 
of 
old 
family 
heirlooms, 
step 
into the memories of Finch 
ancestors, 
experiencing 
the world uniquely as each 
family member did. In one 
such sequence, the character 
plays as a baby sitting in a 
bathtub, able to control the 
bath toys floating and swirling 
around in the water as Mozart 
plays alongside the player’s 
movements. 
The 
game’s 
emotional journey is ingrained 
in its interactivity.
This isn’t to say that all 
modern 
video 
games 
are 
art. On the contrary, truly 
artful games make up only a 
small portion of the medium. 
However, this is the case 
with all artistic mediums. For 
every masterfully constructed 
art-film, there’s a mindless 
blockbuster, and for every 
“What 
Remains 
of 
Edith 
Finch,” there’s a “Call of 
Duty.” There’s nothing wrong 
with the latter — it’s in fact 
beloved by many — but for the 
first time in the history of the 
young medium, video games 
are beginning to consistently 
offer an upper echelon of well-
crafted games that tell deeply 
felt and uniquely experienced 
stories. Today, some of the 
most moving, profound stories 
being told anywhere are being 
told in video games — we’ve 
come a long, long way from 
“Pong.”

I love video games. For me, 
they are almost inextricably 
tied up in childhood nostalgia. 
I think of countless hours 
spent 
with 
my 
brothers 
huddled around a GameCube, 
Wii or PlayStation. I think 
of collecting Pokemon on my 
GameBoy 
Advance 
during 
long car trips. These probably 
sound like familiar stories, 
and that’s because they’re the 
kind of experiences shared by 
many kids who grew up during 
video games’ “golden age” 
through the late ’90s and early 
2000s. As millennials grew up, 
video games seemed to change 
with them — just look how far 
graphics have come from the 
clunky, polygonal look of the 
N64. This change expands 
far beyond how video games 
look, however, and has greater 
implications for how they tell 
stories. The last 15 years have 
seen video games come into 
their own as a unique form of 

expression.
I’ve always held that many 
of the best pieces of art — 
your “Casablanca”s, your “Les 
Misérables”s, your “Catcher in 
the Rye”s — are told via their 
respective mediums because 

that medium is the only way to 
most effectively tell the story. 
A great film, for example, 
should be able to do and show 
things that only a film can do. 
Today, we’re in the midst of 
video gaming’s renaissance; 
inspired, 
motivated 
content 
creators 
are 
continuously 

finding new ways to push the 
boundaries 
of 
storytelling 
within the interactive medium 
of video games at both the 
indie and mainstream level.
This 
prolific 
explosion 
of artful storytelling didn’t 
just 
happen 
spontaneously, 
however. Rather, it was a slow 
build over nearly two decades of 
progress and experimentation. 
Through much of the ’80s, 
video games existed mostly 
as 
novelties; 
games 
like 
“Tetris” or “Galaga,” which 
told no stories, but were just 
intended to be, well, games. 
Throughout the early to mid 
’90s, this began to change. 
Games like “The Legend of 
Zelda: A Link to the Past” 
began incorporating fleshed 
out stories with dialogue. The 
beauty of these early story-
based single player games was 
the ability of the player to step 
into the world of the game. For 
example, Link, the protagonist 
of “The Legend of Zelda,” 
has no lines of dialogue; he’s 
just a stand-in for the player. 
These roleplaying games had

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

A few years ago, Charlie 
Kaufman (“Eternal Sunshine of 
the Spotless Mind”) and Duke 
Johnson (“Community”) made 
the 
stop-motion 
animation 
film “Anomalisa” with eerily 
realistic puppets. I watched the 
first 15 minutes with my mom 
last summer before a rather 
explicit sex scene started and 
I quickly changed the channel. 
“That’s why I recognized it!” 
my mom yelled and shuddered. 
When 
the 
film 
was 
first 
released, she and a friend went 
to the theater to see it under the 
impression of watching a funny 
animated movie — more along 
the lines of Disney’s “Big Hero 
6” than Seth Rogen’s “Sausage 
Party.” I remember her friend 
laughing and telling the story 
at a Christmas party, acting out 
how my mom covered her face 
with her jacket and eventually 
ran out of the theater. Sure, it’s 
weird watching puppets having 
sex, but her reaction had more 
to do with the phenomenon 
called “Uncanny Valley.”
Kaufman and Johnson were 
warned 
“Anomalisa” 
would 
creep 
out 
audiences 
since 
the puppets were 3D printed 
and highly photorealistic, the 
equivalent of a painting by 
Richard Estes. In an interview 
with the Los Angeles Times, 
Johnson 
explained 
their 
reasoning 
for 
this 
hyper-
realistic style:
“The challenge we felt with 
so much animated stuff is that 
you’re always conscious of the 
animation, and we kept asking, 
‘What if we could escape that? 
What would it be like?’” In 
other words, these filmmakers 

steered into the skid, embracing 
the 
disturbing 
nature 
of 
Uncanny Valley, a theory that 
Stamps 
Associate 
Professor 
Heidi Kumao describes as “the 
aesthetics of a human look-
alike.” As Kumao wrote in 
an email interview with The 
Daily, “We are fine with (and 
have empathy for) objects that 
have human features, but are 
recognizably different from us. 
When the look-alike appears 

to resemble a human being too 
closely, however, we become 
uneasy. An eerie sensation is 
triggered. We are naturally 
repulsed by objects that are so 
realistic that we almost mistake 
them for a real person.”
Technological advancements 
in the medium of animation 
drive 
the 
competition 
between 
large 
companies 
like Pixar, Disney and video 
game corporations to achieve 
ultimate realism. According to 
Professor Kumao, “realism is 
their currency. It is how these 
types of movies sell themselves: 
They try to outdo each other 

with 
technical 
wizardry. 
As they strive to reach this 
technical goal, the goalposts 
keep moving.”
In 
addition, 
the 
fervor 
around 
virtual 
reality 
and 
augmented reality has turned 
animators into cowboys in the 
Wild West as they discover how 
to make animation interactive 
and 
visualize 
360 
degree 
environments. 
As 
a 
result, 
cutting-edge technology has 
forever altered the process of 
animation. Take “Anomalisa,” 
for instance, which used 18 
different 3D-printed versions 
of the main character, Michael 
Stone, so the animators could 
change 
expressions 
and 
physical gestures with extreme 
precision. However, as Kumao 
wrote, 
this 
scramble 
for 
realism is a “technical task that 
leaves nothing to the viewer’s 
imagination.”
Although 
brand 
new 
technology 
like 
VR 
and 
3D 
printing 
are 
incredibly 
expensive, 
access 
to 
basic, 
affordable 
equipment 
has 
also altered the independent 
animation 
scene. 
Since 
the 
creation of YouTube in 2005, 
several 
animation 
artists 
have 
established 
themselves 
as popular channels. “How it 
Should Have Ended,” “Happy 
Tree Friends,” “Cyanide and 
Happiness” and many more all 
benefited from the affordability 
and easy access to animation 
technology as well as the rise 
of social media. No longer do 
studios have a monopoly on the 
art form, as individual artists 
and anyone with a computer 
can create their own material. 
For these low-budget YouTube 
channels, there is no race for 
realism. The same goes for many 
animated television series that

The Uncanny Valley effect 
& the future of animation

FILM NOTEBOOK

produce over a dozen episodes 
each season. While the old “Tom 
and Jerry” cartoons and the 
new episodes from the reboot 
noticeably differ in style, the 
series has stuck to 2D animation 
and less-realistic avatars as 
have other cartoon staples like 
“The 
Simpsons.” 
However, 
Hollywood 
productions 
and 
some independent films have 
larger staffs, more money, more 
time and a desire for realism, 
which can lead to some ethical 
problems.
After the tragic death of 
actor Paul Walker during the 
shooting of “Furious 7,” the 
studio used his brother as a body 
double and computer-generated 
images of the deceased Walker 
to finish the film. Some people 
congratulated Weta Digital for 
preserving 
Walker’s 
legacy, 
while 
others 
felt 
queasy 
watching this digital rendering 
of the actor. The latter not 
only questioned the ethical 
legitimacy of the quasi-real 
CGI, but also felt the images 
fell irretrievably deep into the 
Uncanny Valley. Since “Furious 
7,” other big franchise films 
have used computer-generated 
clips of actors. For example, in 
“Rogue One,” audiences did a 
double take at the animation of 

Grand Moff Tarkin portrayed 
by Peter Cushing (“Dracula”), 
a beloved actor who died 20 
years prior to the release of 
this particular “Star Wars” 
installment.
Besides 
bringing 
actors 
back to life, studios have also 
started to animate younger 
versions of stars like Robert 
Downey 
Jr. 
(“Iron 
Man”) 
in 
“Captain 
America: 
Civil 
War.” While the script did call 
for a brief appearance by a 
younger Tony Stark, Marvel’s 
experiment 
inspired 
Martin 
Scorsese to “de-age” Robert 
De Niro to fit a younger role 
in the much-anticipated film 
“The Irishman.” So where’s 
the line? Should older stars 
skilled in their craft be able 
to take opportunities away 
from up-and-coming actors? 
Is de-aging as morally tricky 
as profiting off of digitally 
reincarnated 
actors 
without 
their 
permission? 
There 
remains plenty of grey area to 
cringe at and debate. However, 
the 
biggest 
concerns 
arise 
when this technology, once 
contained to the most powerful 
and wealthy companies that 
must obey legal restrictions, 
becomes available to that creep 
commenting 
anonymously 

online or irresponsible internet 
users.
The invention of FakeApp, 
and other similar programs, 
has made this a reality. Almost 
anyone can paste a random 
face on another person’s body 
with this software that leaves 
minimal differences between a 
real video and a “deepfake.” Like 
many worrisome communities 
on the web, deepfakes have a 
faithful following on Reddit 
where users post videos ranging 
from innocent re-imaginings 
of superheroes with different 
actors to modified pornography 
featuring celebrities, politicians 
or 
exes. 
These 
are 
the 
consequences of animation’s 
quest for realism — a quest 
that the Uncanny Valley can 
keep in check. The discomfort 
that forms when an animation 
looks too realistic is an ethical 
defense mechanism. When a 
de-aged or computer-generated 
version of a deceased actor 
appears on screen, listen to the 
urge to squirm and feel a little 
sick in the stomach. Someone or 
something is trying to warn us 
about the future of animation: 
We are on a dangerous path 
and our only guide is the 
phenomenon of the Uncanny 
Valley.

With feats in entertainment, 
technology 
and 
production, 
The Rogue Initiative is a 
true triple threat. The Rogue 
Initiative builds worlds with 
the aid of technology and 
immersive storytelling in a way 
that goes beyond the mediums 
they explore. Through film, 
television and video games, the 
tech-fueled, 
entertainment-
driven and collaboration-based 
start-up is making waves in 
Hollywood and beyond. The 
Daily had a phone interview 
with University alum Brad 
Etheridge, 
The 
Rogue 
Initiative’s Creative Executive, 
about the power of a story 
and the future of immersive 
content.
The Rogue Initiative builds 
the medium around the story, 
making the company a “cross-
medium” production studio. 
“That looks like the user would 
want to be that character, make 
it a video game,” Etheridge 

explained. Tailoring the stories 
to the medium creates a unique 
perspective and a changing 
role for production studios. 
But then again, Rogue is not a 
regular production studio.
Etheridge 
wants 
to 
tell 
stories, 
because 
it’s 
about 
“finding 
those 
stories 
and 
partnering 
with 
Hollywood 
creatives 
with 
those 
new 
and unique ideas.” How does 
technology 
influence 
the 
stories they tell at Rogue? 
Etheridge explains that the 
intersection 
is 
incredibly 
relevant to what they do. 
After all, they are both an 
entertainment studio and tech 
company. 
The Rogue Initiative is a 
story-focused studio that sees 
entertainment as a vehicle to 
tell stories and build worlds. 
Working 
in 
video 
games, 
Rogue 
understands 
the 
immersive power of media. 
So what do they think about 
the direction of virtual and 
augmented reality? Etheridge 
explained that at Rogue, they 
want to be on the cutting 

edge as a “forward-thinking” 
company and take part in the 
“community” 
involved 
with 
new tech.
“It’s really about the idea 
of being part of those first 
movers,” 
Etheridge 
said, 
following up with the fact that 
it needs to make “financial 
sense.” Keeping up with the 
hottest and newest tech is a 
risk — a very expensive risk 
— so for a rising start-up like 
Rogue, they want to ensure 
the choices they make in terms 
of innovative entertainment 
experiences 
are 
wise 
and 
rational.
As of now, the company 
is working on a top secret 
creative partnership project 
with “Transformers” director 
Michael Bay. By associating 
with creatives and Hollywood 
big shots like Bay, The Rogue 
Initiative and their focus on 
stories is sure be recognized. 
The intersection of mediums, 
technologies 
and 
worlds 
collide at The Rogue Initiative, 
and we can’t wait to see what’s 
to come.

On Friday, Mar. 23, Netflix 
is releasing an original movie, 
“Game Over, Man!” starring 
Adam DeVine, Blake Anderson 
and Anders Holm, of Comedy 
Central’s 
“Workaholics.” 
The film, which was created, 
written and produced by the 
three stars, follows the antics 
and adventures of three hotel 
employees who, in the midst 
of making a pivotal deal with 
a young, reckless, millionaire 
party-boy (Utkarsh Ambudkar, 
“White 
Famous”) 
to 
fund 
the making of an original 
video game, find themselves 
combating 
terrorists 
and 
fighting for their lives.
In a sense, the movie is 
reminiscent of “Die Hard” 
— a “Die Hard” for stoners, 
if you will — filled with 
suspense, shock, stunts and, 
of course, humor. Between 
scenes involving capers, such 
as the building of a rig in an 
attempt to defeat the terrorists 
through Salvia asphyxiation 
and full frontal nudity, DeVine, 
Anderson and Holm are in 
their element, proving their 
writing, production and acting 
chops.
In an interview with The 
Daily, DeVine, Anderson and 
Holm discussed the process 
of writing and creating “Game 
Over, Man!,” how it differs from 
their work on “Workaholics” 
and their favorite production 
moments.
“We wrote the movie about 
six years ago, and we’ve been 
working it, and re-working it 
and changing different stuff,” 
DeVine said. “We finally shot it 
last year at about this time, and 
then we did post-production. 
We’re excited to actually have 
it come out for everyone to see. 
“
The movie’s original release 
date was Apr. 20 but got moved 
up to Mar. 23.
“Netflix saw it and was so 
excited, and wanted to release 
it sooner,” DeVine said. “We’ve 
been sitting on the movie for a 
while, so they were like, let’s 
just put it out. Also, we like 
to think it’s a 4/20 gift for all 
the people who are celebrating 
4/20 
every 
day 
in 
their 
lifestyle. It’s a 4/20 miracle.”
The 
personalities 
and 
energies of the three are 
electric, with their sense of 
humor just as present and 
sharp in real life as it is on 
screen. While each has his 
own 
distinct 
charms 
and 
characteristics, they seem to 
speak and think in harmony, 
in a way that is only possible 
if you have written, produced 
and acted together on a TV 
show for over seven years.
“The story (of “Game Over, 
Man!”) 
was 
something 
we 
were all throwing around,” 
said Holm, who is credited 
as the principal writer of the 
film. “I’m the guy that goes 
and takes our dreams and our 
ideas and turns it into what I 
like to refer to as ‘The Quilt of 
Comedy.’”
“And you keep them warm 
at night. Thank you for that,” 
Anderson chimed in.
“That’s right,” Holm agreed. 
“I bundle the ideas up, and 

keep them warm. But this is our 
movie — the group’s movie. It’s 
a labor of love for me to be able 
to go off and write for these 
goddamn comedy geniuses.”
“God, I love you,” said 
Anderson. “I love you Anders 
Holm and Adam DeVine.”
“Okay. Now we’re hugging, 
and kissing. We’re currently 
kissing,” Holm said, feeding 
kissing noises into the phone.
“Workaholics,” 
which 
wrapped up its final season 
in 2017, features characters 
Blake, Ders and Adam who, 
as college dropout druggies 
working in a telemarketing 
office, may seem quite similar 
to Joel, Darren and Alexxx of 
“Game Over, Man!” But, when 
asked if character confusion 
was a concern, Holm seemed 
optimistic.
“When you start from the 
ground up, and you go, OK: 
Who are these people, and 
why are they in this movie? 
Then, you start to find out 
why they’re different,” Holm 
said. “And then, when you start 
writing for actors, because 
you know their strong suits 
are in certain places and not 
in others, you can still play to 
their 
performing 
strengths. 
By putting a different point of 
view and perspective in the 
story, all of a sudden you have 
a new man.”
Though 
the 
film 
was 
originally written six years 
ago, it is quite hip to the times, 
including a number of jabs at 
current societal trends, such as 
the obsession with vaping and 
the purchasing of social media 
followers. But the heart of the 
movie stays true to the original 
script.
“Everything else was added 
later on. But we were like, ‘The 
world needs to see Adam’s 
penis. Everything else, we’ll 
come up with at a later date,’” 
said Anderson and Holm.
“You 
know, 
we’re 
like 
anyone else,” Anderson added. 
“We’re walking around seeing 
idiots vaping, and we’re lucky 
enough to be able to create a 
movie and put those freakin’ 
Bozo the Clowns in a movie.”
DeVine, Anderson and Holm 
have been working on the film 
with Seth Rogen and Scott 
Rudin’s company for five to six 
years.
“We had a few studios that 
were pretty interested, and 
then Netflix came in, in a real 
way, and gave us the budget 
that we wanted to make the 
movie as big and as fun as we 
needed it to feel,” DeVine said. 
“We wanted to come from 
‘Workaholics,’ which is this 
small, basic cable television 
show, and make the movie feel 
much larger than anything 
you’ve seen from us. And 
Netflix was able to give us a 
proper budget to do that.”
The 
movie 
features 
a 
number of cameos, including 
Shaggy, Steve-O and Flying 
Lotus, as well as people who 
have appeared in episodes of 
“Workaholics,” such as Jillian 
Bell (“SuperMansion”).
“We filmed the whole movie 
up in Vancouver, and a lot of 
people we were calling just 
for one day of work. So, you 
gotta kind of pull the ‘Homie 
Pass’ for something like that. 
You know, the ‘Homie Pass,’” 

Anderson said.
At the risk of giving away 
any 
spoilers 
(apart 
from 
DeVine’s nakedness), it is safe 
to say that the film has its fair 
share of unexpected plot lines 
that drive the exciting and 
unpredictable nature of the 
movie.
“Anything that comes off as 
shocking ties into the story. 
There’s not nudity for nudity’s 
sake — it is pushing the story 
forward,” Anderson said.
“Though, I have been dying 
to see Adam’s nude penis,” 
Holm said. “It served my story, 
I’ll tell you that.”
“Yeah,” 
DeVine 
agreed. 
“Ders has a life story, and at 
the end of it, he gets to see my 
penis.”
Not only is “Game Over, 
Man!” the three’s first major 
motion picture together, but 
it is the first production of 
this caliber that they have 
approached as a single entity.
“Weirdly, for me, it was kind 
of seamless,” Holm said, of the 
transition from “Workaholics” 
to “Game Over, Man!” “We 
walked onto our giant set 
where we literally built an 
entire floor of a hotel, with 
hotel rooms, stairwells... it was 
a trip. But then I was like, let’s 
do this. We shoot tomorrow.”
“Yeah, I think if we would 
have done this movie during 
season one or two or three (of 
‘Workaholics’), we might have 
been overwhelmed,” DeVine 
said. “I think we got to this 
movie at the perfect place in 
our lives and careers. Because 
it is a lot, to be given millions 
and millions of dollars to go off 
and make a movie. But since we 
were able to do ‘Workaholics’ 
for 
so 
long, 
and 
feel 
so 
comfortable, and be the bosses 
for seven years, by the end of 
it — we got pretty comfortable 
steering the ship.”
While 
there 
is 
no 
disputing 
their 
experience 
with 
“Workaholics” 
greatly 
prepared them for their work 
on “Game Over, Man!,” there 
is a stark difference between 
working on a TV show and a 
high budget film.
“When you’re making TV — 
and we were involved in every 
aspect of the show — you’re 
reading scripts for episodes, 
you’re acting, you’re casting 
episodes, you’re watching cuts 
of episodes. So stuff can really 
back up on you,” Anderson 
said. “But in the movie biz, 
you really get to focus on each 
thing individually, and you 
have a lot more time to live in 
the scenes and the comedy, so 
that was refreshing.”
“Also, TV shows move so 
quickly. We would have to 
shoot, sometimes, eight to 10 
pages in a day, which is a ton,” 
DeVine said. “In a movie, you 
only need to shoot two to four 
pages for the whole day, so you 
really have time to make sure 
you get it right. So when you 
see a bad movie, just know that 
they really, really blew it.”
“Also,” 
Anderson 
added, 
“we were coming off of seven 
seasons of a show on TV, so it 
was kind of refreshing to have 
all those freedoms that a movie 
allows you to have.”

“And especially at Netflix, 
where you don’t have to worry

about popcorn or candy sales — 
they allow you to be as creative 
as you want to be,” DeVine 
said. “They also don’t have “R” 
ratings, so... anything goes.”
“Anything 
goes,” 
agreed 
Anderson.
When asked about the ideal 
way to view “Game Over, 
Man!,” Anderson sung, in a 
teasing tone: “With your pants 
off.”
DeVine and Holm scoffed 
and laughed at Anderson, as if 
they suddenly disapproved of a 
joking, insincere response.
“I 
would 
say,” 
DeVine 
started, “get the biggest TV you 
can find. Watch it with your 
friends. Watch it on a gigantic 
TV — the biggest TV that you 
can get your hands on. Because 
it’s a cool, big movie, and it’s 
kind of a shame to watch it on 
your phones. This is a movie 
that I think will play better on 
a larger screen.”
“Take all the bedsheets in 
the dorm and you tie them 

together, and hang them out 
the window to make a giant 
screen, and project it,” Holm 
said in a booming, affected 
tone.
“I know you’re doing, like, 
a fake voice, but that’s a really 
good idea,” DeVine said.
As the creators and stars, 
picking a favorite moment of 
the film proved to be difficult 
for the bunch.
“They’re all our babies,” 
DeVine 
confessed. 
“A 
fan 
favorite is probably the fist fight 
when we first encountered the 
terrorists, and I am fully nude 
from the waist down. That was 
also pretty difficult to film, 
because Blake wouldn’t stop 
staring at me.”
“Knock it off!” Anderson 
refuted. “One of my favorites 
was the big stunt with us 
hanging 
between 
the 
two 
buildings, 
because 
we 
had 
never really gotten to do a stunt 
of that scale. It almost felt like 
we were Marvel heroes for a 

second.”
“I like watching all the bad 
guy stuff,” Holm said. “I’ve 
acted with these guys for so 
long, which is fun, but to sit 
back and watch characters 
that I’ve never seen come to 
life, and do what was in my 
brain in my basement, was a 
lot of fun. Watching the scene 
where Jillian (Bell), who’s just 
credited as somebody who shits 
her pants... that was funny.”
“Also, Blake shit his pants 
one time,” DeVine stated.
“No I didn’t!”
“I wish that were a joke — ”
“I did not do that,” Anderson 
said.
“Well,” explained DeVine, 
“something happened that one 
day. We’ll never know, but he 
definitely left the room and 
changed his pants, so...”
“It 
was 
a 
wardrobe 
malfunction,” Anderson said.
“Yeah. 
A 
wardrobe 

malfunction,” 
DeVine 

repeated. “Sure.”

SINGLE & VIDEO REVIEW: FREAKY FRIDAY

 Last week, comedic rapper Lil 
Dicky released his first single 
in three years. “Freaky Friday,” 
a spin-off of the iconic mother-
daughter comedy popularized 
by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay 
Lohan, recruited Chris Brown, 
Ed Sheeran and Kendall Jenner 
to help compose a song in which 
Dicky and Brown switch bodies.
 As Lil Dicky’s brand is self-
deprecation based on his admit-
tedly white and lame style — an 
oddity in a genre mostly domi-
nated by Black men with swagger 
— switching bodies with Chris 
Brown opened the floodgates 
for funny lyrics that play on art-
ist stereotypes. The song begins 
with Lil Dicky’s realization that 
he’s woken up in Chris Brown’s 
body. The lyrics (actually voiced 
by Chris Brown), “I’m so fly and 
I can dance / There’s tattoos on 
my neck,” hilariously expose the 
stark contrast between Dicky and 
Brown. The lyrics go a step fur-
ther, as Lil Dicky (again, actually 
Chris Brown) takes advantage of 
his ability to say the N-word and 
rejoices at the size of his member. 
Controversial and uncomfort-
able? Maybe, but Lil Dicky has 
never shied away from push-
ing the envelope or discussing 
penises.
 The track gets even funnier 
when Chris Brown wakes up as 
Lil Dicky and realizes the perks 
of being white and barely rec-
ognizable as a celebrity: “Ain’t 
nobody judging ‘cause I’m Black 
or my controversial past / I’ma go 
and see a movie and relax.” Even-
tually, though, Brown (Dicky’s 
voice) grows tired of being some-
one else, and after he realizes he 

truly likes being himself (can I get 
a cliché?) the rappers are reunited 
with their own bodies. The outro 
provides some extra comedy, as 
Lil Dicky is thrown into the body 
of Ed Sheeran and then Kendall 
Jenner, after which he realizes 
Chris Brown is much cooler than 
Ed Sheeran and having private 
access to the female anatomy for 
a day might be interesting.
 Sonically, “Freaky Friday” 
is extremely basic, with a thin 
chord progression and beat akin 

to last year’s hackneyed hit, “I’m 
The One.” The track is much 
more entertaining when paired 
with the elaborate and extended 
music video, the driving force 
behind the growing popularity of 
the new single.
- Mike Watkins, Daily Arts Writer

 With a Chinese red paper lan-
tern as the first shot of the video, 
I didn’t exactly have high hopes 
for this music video. What was to 
follow? Subtle racism? Cultural 
appropriation? Goody, goody. 
Couldn’t wait.
 My bad feeling turned out to be 
spot on. I shouldn’t have to spell 
out why implying that the Asian 
server can’t understand English 
is racist and tokenizing as heck 
(Reminder: General Tsao’s Chick-
en is in no way actually Chinese. 

Nobody in China knows what 
that shit is). Of course, the server 
also turns out to be a mystical 
wizard and suddenly gains Eng-
lish comprehension skills when 
it serves to forward the sloppily 
constructed plot of the video. And 
all of this perfectly dropped right 
before Asian Pacific American 
Heritage Month in May.
 Follow with a brief scene where 
Lil Dicky commiserates about his 
own un-coolness whilst watching 
some clips of Chris Brown doing 
his thing. Brown may be “so good 
at dancing” and have the “sickest 
tattoos,” but did Dicky forget his 
idol also nearly beat Rihanna to 
death? Brown even references his 
“controversial past” a bit later on 
in the video. Assault isn’t funny.
 In comparison to the rest of Lil 
Dicky’s music videos, “Freaky 
Friday” isn’t all that unique; it has 
the same cringey mid-2000s bad 
meme humor, objectification and 
downright stupidity that many of 
Lil Dicky’s creations share.
 There were times when I did 
laugh. Who doesn’t enjoy watch-
ing someone poke fun at them-
selves for three minutes straight? 
Maybe if Dicky hadn’t gone out 
of his way to include every single 
problematic thing that’s common 
in movie media — objectification, 
emphasizing the “otherness” of 
non-Western people and cul-
tures, rampant sexism, tone-deaf 
racist undertones and tossing the 
N-word around as if it was some 
sort of joke — I would have even 
enjoyed it.
 Try harder, Lil Dicky. Being 
intentionally offensive is not a 
good look.

When people ask me what 
Performing Arts Technology 
is, I sometimes struggle to 
find the precise definition. For 
such a specific department, 
the vastness of its contents is 
pretty 
overwhelming, 
even 
for someone in the major. 
Everyone 
in 
the 
program 
has a different passion and 
a different area of the field 
that they’re pursuing, some of 
which may not even exist yet.
The PAT Showcase this 
past Saturday gave audiences 
a glimpse into the expansive 
cross-section of technology 
and art.
The showcase took place 
over two separate sections, one 
in the Chip Davis Technology 
Studio and one in Macintosh 
Theatre. Each event had its 
own unique performances and 
presentations that felt original 
and creative.
In the Davis Studio, live 
performances 
constituted 
many of the performances, 
however, many acts were pre-

recorded and produced pieces 
that 
students 
composed. 
The Davis Studio boasts a 
unique listening environment, 
complete with a plethora of 
state-of-the-art speakers to 
create an immersive listening 
environment 
for 
audiences. 
The 
presentation 
of 
these 
electronic compositions was 
really interesting, and although 
it 
seemed 
like 
something 
you wouldn’t typically see at 
an SMTD concert, they still 
seemed to be treated as such, 
with light dimming before they 
were performed and audiences 
applauding after.
A 
lot 
of 
times 
in 
a 
conservatory 
environment, 
electronically 
produced 
music is seen as inferior to 
traditionally composed music. 
At the showcase, this notion 
seemed 
to 
be 
completely 
abandoned: 
Each 
unique 
piece was given attention and 
respect. The differences in 
each piece were celebrated by 
the audience and the students 
alike. These strictly electronic 
pieces brought nuance to a 
musical climate that often 
feels void of emotion and 
creativity. Many are against 
the implementation of more 
electronics 
in 
music, 
but 
how could you be against a 
movement 
that 
encourages 
creativity?
As a PAT student within 
SMTD, 
I 
have 
constantly 
been encouraged to engage 
in collaborative projects with 
other members of the school 
in 
both 
conventional 
and 
experimental ways. This desire 
to collaborate, with other PAT 
majors and with other artists, 
was made abundantly apparent 
at the showcase. Many works 
involved students playing a 
variety of instruments in a 
variety of genres, and using 
technology 
to 
alter 
their 
timbre or to accompany them.
One of my favorite pieces 
from the night was “War 
Machines 
Dance 
to 
Piano 
Music” by Matias Vilaplana 

and 
Joey 
Panlertkitsakul. 
The piece involved Matias, 
a graduate student in the 
program, 
using 
electronics 
to alter Joey’s piano playing. 
By 
miking 
the 
piano, 
Matias was able to alter the 
sounds with delays, filters 
and 
reverberation 
in 
live 
performance, as well as alter 
videos 
of 
machines 
being 
projected 
on 
screen. 
The 
music felt very minimalistic, 
however, in conjunction with 
live signal processing. The 
piece evolved into something 
completely different and more 
expansive over time.
Some other performances 
included saxophonists from 
the jazz department and a solo 
double bass piece by Spencer 
Haney from their upcoming 
senior thesis. There was no 
shortage of variety at the 
showcase.
Things also took a turn 
towards a more commercial 
direction. Artists like Clem 
Turneri and Aliyah Marie 
Smith shared songs off of 
their upcoming and recently 
released albums. Borrowing 
from R&B, pop and even 
experimental influences, the 
artists sang their own songs 
in 
addition 
to 
performing 
live 
looping, 
mixing 
and 
projecting. The performances 
showed a completely different 
side 
to 
PAT 
than 
many 
other performances in the 
department. Although many 
had modern influences, these 
two 
specifically 
felt 
more 
independent and void of a need 
to be groundbreaking. These 
performances 
showcased 
the songwriting talents PAT 
majors are capable of.
The one thing that cannot be 
emphasized enough here is just 
how diverse this showcase, 
and the PAT department itself, 
actually is. While students 
generally take the same classes 
during their first year of study, 
they 
eventually 
break 
out 
and start to take classes that 
interest them and the areas 
they want to focus on, and this 
was especially apparent by just 
how many different types of 
performances there were.
Another 
detail 
to 
note 
is 
just 
how 
involved 
the 
department is. Not only are 
PAT majors involved in all 

sorts of different productions 
across campus, but younger 
members of the community are 
just as involved as the seniors. 
Seeing a large representation 
of the newer members of 
the department was really 
inspiring to me. Technology in 
art is moving at a rapid pace, 
and it’s nice to know that the 
new generation of PAT majors 
is just as motivated to advance 
this world as the past.
This year’s PAT showcase 
was one of the best the 
department 
has 
ever 
had. 
Not 
only 
were 
members 
of the community able to 
showcase the bridge between 
art 
and 
technology 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
different 
ways, 
but students were able to 
express themselves through 
technology. Many may argue 
that music and art, in general, 
feel more artificial with the 
increased implementation of 
new technology. But with the 
passion that the performers 
displayed on Saturday night, 
I’m not sure if I can give this 
argument much credibility. 

A PAT major’s 
reflections on 
the program

The tranquil, introspective 
air of the Detroit Institute of 
Arts was suddenly violated by 
the phone I was clutching in 
my hand and its unsolicited 
decision to blare a tribal drum 
beat. At lightspeed, I pressed 
down on the volume controls 
all while fellow museum-goers 
cast disapproving looks in my 
direction. To all the people I 
secretly giggled at when your 
phone went off in class, I’m 
sorry. I now understand your 
pain.
The room couldn’t clear out 
slower as I sat on a cushy bench 
inspecting my shoelaces. When 
the last person left carrying my 
eternal embarrassment, I could 
finally freely use the reason I 
came all the way downtown. 
The main attraction of my latest 
DIA visit is what the museum 
calls Lumin, a mobile tour that 
uses Google’s Tango augmented 
reality (AR) platform to supply 
visitors with a modern way 
to innovatively engage with 
the 
museum’s 
collection. 
However, it is less a tour than 
it is a personal learning tool. 
The 
entirety 
of 
Lumin 
is 
loaded onto a single Android 
smartphone that the DIA rents 
out to visitors; you become the 
tour guide and decide what 
you want to experience in this 
strange new digital world.
The seven exhibits currently 
integrated with Lumin each 
implement the technology in 
distinct ways. A variety of AR 
experiences are available at 
one’s fingertips, from a Persian 
cylinder seal rolling out an 
impression 
on 
virtual 
wet 
clay to a tree stump gradually 
being carved out to match the 
Yoruba 
royal 
presentation 
bowl sitting behind a glass 

case. Sight is not the only 
sense Lumin manipulates — 
my aforementioned brush with 
societal ostracism turned out to 
incorporate sound effectively 
(just when I was the only 
person listening). In front of 
me hung multiple war drums 
with depictions of thunderbirds 
embellishing them. Tapping on 
one of them via Lumin added a 
musical layer that combined to 
beautifully produce traditional 
Native American piece.
Due to the inanimate nature 
of most visual art, what one sees 
is what one gets. There may be 
written descriptions next to 
a painting, or knowledgeable 
museum staffers present to 
enrich one’s understanding of 
the art, but they are accessory. 
The 
central 
relationship 
between art and audience is 
defined by the latter; only the 
viewer can decide how they 
personally interpret the art 
and what emotions it evokes. 
With 
Lumin, 
however, 
the 
smartphone becomes a living 
lens, a third party that connects 
the other two through a whole 
new dimension.
The presentation of Lumin 
lends itself to education. While 
I was circling an Egyptian 
sarcophagus 
to 
reveal 
an 
X-ray view of the skeleton 
inside, the device also revealed 
information. 
Touching 
key 
points on the mummy brought 
up slides and images that 
described 
the 
process 
of 
mummification and how the 
curators cared for the artifact. 
The whole experience connects 
visitors with art in global 
contexts beyond the physical 
walls of the museum. In a press 
release about the technology, 
current DIA director Salvador 
Salort-Pons 
praised 
these 
educative 
values, 
saying 
“augmented reality allows the 
user to see the unseen, imagine 
art 
in 
its 
original 
setting 

and understand how objects 
were used and experienced in 
people’s everyday lives.”
There is no denying that 
today’s 
youth 
is 
acutely 
accustomed to technology all 
across the board. While this 
has created separate problems 
in and of themselves, this 
connection can be positively 
exploited to trick kids into 
learning without them even 
realizing. Although I loved 
going to museums when I 
was young, I dreaded having 
to sit through guided tours 
and being overwhelmed with 
waves of information. I wanted 
to explore at my own pace 
and learn in my own way, but 
unfortunately, 
to 
a 
child’s 
mind, most art is surface-
level, and trying to explain it 
to them usually leaves them 
more confused than they were 
before. Yet after my latest 
adventure at the DIA, I am 
convinced that technology like 
Lumin is prime for education; it 
sits perfectly at the crossroads 
of explanation and exploration.
The problem, however, lies 
in the fact that Lumin has a 
bit of an identity crisis. It is 
only in the prototype phase, 
but there are minor issues 
with the experience. I had 
to go back and get a second 
device after my first one froze, 
and only select artifacts on 
the first floor are given stops, 
rather than centerpieces of the 
collection like Diego Rivera’s 
Detroit Industry Murals — 
the DIA does assure though 
that similarly requested stops 
will be added in the coming 
months. Silly enough, I also 
couldn’t shake the feeling that 
I was some vapid YouTube 
personality vlogging due to 
the mounted grip that was 
used to hold up the phone. 
Despite these, the real issue 
is that Lumin is more geared 
towards a sophisticated adult 

mind rather than a child’s. 
Kids would definitely be able 
to use the technology with the 
help of an adult, but the whole 
experience is not very kid-
friendly; the UI is sleek and 
modern, but caters to the tech-
savvy. It asks a lot of the user 
and almost requires them to 
have a previous understanding 
of similar technology to truly 
get the most out of it.
While I’m not trying to 
say only children should be 
getting educated in the arts, 
the most important factor in 
cultivating an appreciation for 
the arts is starting at an early 
age. Kids possess a genuine 
sense of wonder and awe when 
experiencing 
art, 
but 
they 
don’t know how to make the 
most out of it. Giving them an 
innovative avenue like Lumin, 
which not only excites and 
entices them but also teaches 
them 
in 
a 
method 
suited 
towards their sensibilities, can 
help them understand art on a 
fundamental level and tap into 
their own creative potential.
During my excursion, I came 
across a local troop of Brownie 
Scouts about to embark on a 
guided tour of the museum. I 
overheard their troop leader 
telling them that the point 
of today’s journey was to see 
the pretty pictures as more 
than pretty pictures. And as 
the bright sun shone upon 
them through the windows 
of the atrium, I realized they 
were 
about 
to 
encounter 
that 
amazing 
moment 
of 
artistic 
illumination, 
the 
same mysterious and magical 
illumination that Lumin is 
named after and attempts to 
recreate. Although Lumin and 
other AR technology like it still 
require retooling before it can 
become a truly intuitive and 
educational tool, holding the 
phone in my hand, I couldn’t 
help but feel like a kid again.
