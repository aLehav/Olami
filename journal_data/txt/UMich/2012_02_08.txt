Big House lease for
Winter Classic
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
DailySportsEditor
The University's Board of
Regents will vote today to
approve the leasing of Michigan
Stadium to host the 2013 NHL,
Winter Classic.
The regents will vote in a spe-
cial meeting at 10 a.m. in the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing. A University source con-
firmed to the Daily that the event
would involve leasing thestadium
to the NHL, which would make it
more likely that alcohol will be
permitted to be sold inside Michi-
gan Stadium.
Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon announced early
last month that the University
and the NHL were in discussions,
but no formal agreement had
been reached.
"We have been approached by
.the NHL about utilizing our facil-
ity for the 2013 Winter Classic,"
Brandon said in a Jan. 5 state-
ment. "There are alot of complex
-circumstances that need to be
ironed out before anything moves
forward. We willhave more to say

if/when something materializes."
If approved, the game would
likely feature the Detroit Red
Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs
on Jan. 1, 2013, which would be
the first Winter Classic match-
up tbat includes a team from
Canada. It would also be the first
Winter Classic held at a college
stadium.
Michigan hosted a hockey
game in Michigan Stadium on
Dec. 11, 2010 - The Big Chill at
the Big House - a 5-0 victory
over Michigan State. Pending
final approval, the Winter ClIs
sic would be the second outdoor
hockey game at Michigan Stadi-
um and would rival the Big Chill's
world-record-setting attendance
of 104,473.
The Sporting News' hockey
analyst Bob McKenzie tweeted
that the matchup would be made
official on Thursday.
The Ontario Hockey League
revealed a doubleheader match
set for Dec. 31, 2011 last week,
with early speculation being that
the gameswould be held at Mich-
igan Stadium as well. But Michi-
gan dismissed those rumors and
an OHL source told the Daily
the.games would likely be played
instead at Comerica Park in
Detroit.

Volunteering abroad

Childreach, a newly formed
campus organization, will soon
take a group of students to Peru
and Tanzania to assist in reno-
vating schools and developing
sustainable programs in the two
countries.
LSA sophomores Lisa Nations
and Olivia Thompson lead
the campus chapter that was
formed this fall as a branch of
Childreach International USA,
a non-profit organization dedi-
cated to improving healthcare
and education for children in
developing countries. The orga-
nization aims to create sustain-
able solutions to these problems
while empowering . community
members.

Nations said she specifically
chose to bring Childreach to the
University because of its unique
goal of achieving sustainable
development, in addition to its
international outreach.
To remain sustainable, the
organization hires local commu-
nity members in the countries to
carry out large construction tasks
beforethe Childreach team mem-
bers arrive in order to give locals
hands-on experience building
so that if anything breaks or
becomes run down in the future,
they have the experience to fix it,
Nations said.
The Childreach team members
then focus their two-week trips
on light renovation work, like

decorating classrooms and paint-
ing the exteriors of schools.
"We get to see firsthand what
all of our fundraising efforts are
giving to this community, which
is really awesome," Nations said.
"The fact that we run sustainable
development projects means that
we know that this is going to be
a lasting thing for the commu-
nity members in years to come,
so children, say, 10 years down
the road will still benefit from the
work we put in."
Thompson said the group
hopes to have a safe and success-
ful first trip as a new organization
on campus and expect to expand
their group in the future.,

SControversies overabortion,
0- birth control grab spotlight

Komen, Obama
contraception
ruling fuel
discussions
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - Politi-
cal turmoil over abortion and
birth control spread suddenly on
yesterday. A high-ranking official
resigned from the Komenbreast-
cancer charity after its back-
tracking treaty with Planned
Parenthood, and Republican
presidential candidates blistered
the Obama administration for a
recent ruling on Catholic hospi-
tals and contraception.
The White House made a point
of declaring it wanted to ease the
concerns of church-affiliated
employers - many would be
required to provide birth control
coverage to their workers under
the new rules - but there was
no word on how those concerns
might be addressed.
The two-track drama pumped
new furor into longstanding
disputes that sometimes take a

backseat in political campaigns
because the lines are so familiar
and firmly drawn. Last week's
Komen-Planned Parenthood dis-
pute stirred many women's groups
that support legal abortion. And
the Obama ruling touched a nerve
with moderate Roman Catholics
who support contraceptives but
also defend their church's right to
run its hospitals and other institu-
tions according to religious con-
victions.
Republican presidential can-
didates pounced on what they
considered a blunder by Presi-
dent Barack Obama. They believe
his administration's ruling will
alienate moderate Catholic vot-
ers who could prove crucial in
November in Ohio, Pennsylvania
and elsewhere.
There also could be political
repercussions from the Susan G.
Komen for the Cure controversy.
The breast-cancer charity, fac-
ing fierce criticism, mostly from
women's groups, quickly over-
turned its decision to cut off
funding to Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood is a major

provider of abortions, but it also
screens women for breast cancer
and other health problems.
In Atlanta, Karen Handel,
a Komen vice president who
played a role in the fund cutoff
decision, resigned yesterday. A
Republican who ran for governor
in Georgia, Handel was seen by
some as an example of what they
felt was an increasing tendency
by Komen to bring partisan poli-
tics into the charity's decisions.
"I am deeply disappointed by
the gross mischaracterizations
of the strategy, its rationale and
my involvement in it," Handel
said in her resignationletter.
Presidential candidate Mitt
Romney, for his part, said he sup-
ported Komen's original decision
to stop funding Planned Parent-
hood.
The arguments came as the
GOP presidential hopefuls cam-
paigned in several states and
Republicans voted in Colorado
and Minnesota. Each candi-
date tried to take advantage of
the unusually intense focus on
reproductive issues.

Mohammed Waheed Hassan, second left, who previously worked as a top UNICEF official, is sworn in as Maldives new
president after Mohamed Nasheed announced his resignation yesterday afternoon in Male, Maldives.

Vice president, a

official, sworn in
MALE, Maldives (AP) - The
Maldives' new president prom-
ised to protect his predecessor
from retribution after he stepped
down amid protests and clashes
between the army and police over
his decision to arrest a top judge.
President Mohammed Waheed
Hassan, who was sworn in yes-
terday, called for chaos on the
streets to stop and for citizens of
this Indian Ocean island nation
to work together after months of
political turmoil.
"I urge everyone to make this a
peaceful country," he said.
Former President Mohamed
Nasheed's Maldivian Democrat-
ic Party insisted his ouster was
a "coup" engineered by rogue
elements of the police and sup-
porters of the country's former
autocratic leader.
However, a Nasheed adviser
denied the resignation came
under duress from the military.

The adviser, who spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the situation, said
Nasheed was left with two choic-
es: order a bloody military crack-
down on the police dissidents or
resign.
Hassan's office also denied
the military pressured Nasheed
to quit in the wake of yesterday's
street clashes.
"It was not a coup at all. It
was the wish of the people," said
Ahmed Thoufeeg, Hassan's sec-
retary.
Nasheed's resignation marked
a stunning fall for the former
human rights campaigner who
defeated the nation's longtime'
ruler to become its first democrat-
ically elected president. Nasheed
was also an environmental celeb-
rity, traveling the world to per-
suade governments to combat the
climate change that could raise
sea levels and inundate his archi-
pelago nation.
Nasheed presented his resig-
nation in a nationally televised
address after police joined the
protesters and then clashed with
soldiers in the streets. Some of

the soldiers then defected to the
police side.
"I don't want to hurt any Mal-
divian. I feel my staying on in
power will only increase the prob-
lems, and it will hurt our citizens,"
Nasheed said. "So the best option
available to me is to step down."
Maldivians waving flags
poured into the streets to cel-
ebrate Nasheed's resignation.
Some playfully threw water at
each other. Soon after, the judge
was released.
U.S. State Department spokes-
woman Victoria Nuland said that
Hassan had informed the U.S.
that the security situation in the
Maldives was now under control
and generally peaceful.
In a phone call with U.S.
officials, Hassan expressed his
strong commitment to a peace-
ful transition of power and the
preservation of democracy.
According to Nuland, the new
Maldivian leader expressed his
intent to form a national unity
government with opposition
participation in the lead-up to a
presidential election scheduled
for November 2013.

Environmentalist group challenges
candidates' support in Asian carp fight

Plan in question
would protect fish
in the Great Lakes
region
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
(AP) - Environmental activists
yesterday challenged President
Barack Obama and the Repub-
licans hoping to unseat him to
support a hotly debated plan to
protect the Great Lakes from an
Asian carp attack by cutting off
their Chicago-area connection
to the Mississippi River water-
shed.

The Healing Our Waters-
Great Lakes Coalition, which
includes more than 100 groups
in the region, included the pro-
posal in a pledge submitted to
the campaigns of Obama and
Republicans Mitt Romney,
Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and
Rick Santorum. None of the
campaigns had any immediate
reaction.
The Great Lakes region
includes heavily contested
and vote-rich states such as
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylva-
nia, New York and Wisconsin.
Michigan's primary is Feb. 28
and Ohio is among states with
a Super Tuesday " primary on

March 6.
The environmental coalition
asked the candidates to promise
if elected to continue an Obama
administration program dealing
with some of the Great Lakes'
most pressing environmental
problems, including invasive
species, toxic pollution, farm
and urban runoff and wildlife
habitat loss.
Congress has appropriated
more than $1 billion for the
Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive since 2009. But supporters
say billions more are needed
over many years to fix the prob-
lems, which have been decades
in the making.

The children are being

Former senator
romps in Minn.,
Col, .and Mo.
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
resurgent Rick Santorum
won Republican presidential
caucuses in Minnesota and
Colorado on yesterday night,
a stunning sweep that raised
fresh questions about front-
runner Mitt Romney's appeal
among the ardent conservatives
at the core of the party's politi-
cal base.
Santorum triumphed, as well,
in a nonbinding Missouri pri-
mary that was worth bragging
rights but no national conven-
tion delegates.
"Conservatism is alive and
well in Missouri and Minne-
sota," the jubilant former Penn-
sylvania senator told cheering
supporters in St. Charles, Mo.
Challenging both his GOP rival
and the Democratic president,
he declared that on issues rang-
ing from health care to "Wall
Street bailouts, Mitt Rom-
ney has the same positions as
Barack Obama."
Returns from 83 percent of
Minnesota's precincts showed
Santorum with 45 percent sup-
port,:.Texas Rep. Ron Paul with
27 percent and Romney - who
won the state in his first try for
the nomination four years ago -
with 17 percent. Former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich trailed
with 11 percent.
It was closer in Colorado,
where returns from all the pre-
cincts showed Santorum with
40 percent of the vote to 35 for
Romney. Gingrich had 13, and
Paul claimed 12 percent.
Romney showed no sign of
disappointment in remarks to
supporters.

"This was a good night for
Rick Santorum. I want to con-
gratulate Sen. Santorum, but I
expect to become the nominee
with your help," he told sup-
porters in Denver.
If the night was good for San-
torum, it was
grim for Gin-
grich, who
made scant2 I
effortin anyof
the states that s
voted during
the day. He ran far off the pace
in both caucus states, forced to
watch from the sidelines while
Santorum boasted of being the
candidate with conservative
appeal.
There were 37 Republican
National Convention delegates
at stake in Minnesota and 33
more in Colorado, and together,
they accounted for the largest
one-day combined total so far in
the raceforthe GOP nomination.
The victories were the first
for Santorum since he eked out a
34-vote win in the lead-off Iowa
caucuses a month ago, and he
reveled in the moment. "I don't
stand here to be the conserva-
tive alternative to Mitt Romney.
I stand here to be the conser-
vative alternative to Barack
Obama," he told his supporters.
He had faded far fromthe lead
in the primaries and caucuses
since, and Gingrich seemed to
eclipse him as the leading con-
servative rival to Romney when
he won the South Carolina pri-
mary late last month.
While Romney throttled
back after victories in Florida
and Nevada in the past several
days, Santorum campaigned
aggressively in all three states
on the ballot, seeking a break-
through to revitalize his cam-
paign.

Case likely to
be appealed to
Supreme Court
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --
me-sex marriage moved one
ep closer to the Supreme Court
sterday when a federal appeals
urt ruled California's ban
iconstitutional, saying it serves
opurpose other than to "lessen
e status and human dignity" of
ys.
A three-judge panel of the 9th
S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ve gay marriage opponents
me to appeal the 2-1 decision
fore orderingthe state to allow
me-sex weddings to resume.
"I'm ecstatic. I recognize that
e have a ways to go yet. We
ay have one or two more legal
eps," said Jane Leyland, who
as gathered with a small crowd
tside the federal courthouse in
wntown San Francisco, cheer-
g as they learned of the ruling.
Leyland married her longtime
rtner, Terry Gilb, during the
e-month window when same-
x marriage was legal in Cali-
rnia.
"But when we first got togeth-
I would have never dreamed
a million years that we would
allowed to be legally married,
d here we are."
The ban known as Proposition
was approved by voters in 2008
th 52 percent of the vote. The
urt said it was unconstitution-
because it singled out a minor-
'group for disparate treatment
r no compelling reason.
The justices concluded that
e law had no purpose other
an to deny gay couples mar-
ge, since California already

grants them all the rights and
benefits of marriage if they regis-
ter as domestic partners.
"Had Marilyn Monroe's film
been called 'How to Register a
Domestic Partnership with a
Millionaire,' it would not have
conveyed the same meaning
as did her famous movie, even
though the underlying drama
for same-sex couples is no differ-
ent," the court said.
The lone dissenting judge
insisted that the ban could help
ensure that children are raised
by married, opposite-sex par-
ents.
The appeals court focused its
decision exclusively on Califor-
nia's ban, not the bigger debate,
even though the court has juris-
diction in nine Western states.
Whether same-sex couples
may ever be denied the right
to marry "is an important and
highly controversial question,"
the court said. "We need not
and do not answer the broader
question in this case."
Six states allow gay couples
to wed - Connecticut, New
Hampshire, Iowa, Massachu-
setts, New York and Vermont
- as well as the District of
Columbia. California, as the
nation's most populous state
and home to more than 98,000
same-sex couples, would be
the gay rights movement's big-
gest prize of them all.
The 9th Circuit concluded
that a trial court judge had
correctly interpreted the Con-
stitution and Supreme Court
precedents when he threw out
Proposition 8.
The measure "serves no
purpose,, and has no effect,
other than to lessen the sta-
tus and human dignity of gays

and lesbians in California, and
to officially reclassify their rela-
tionships and families as inferior
to those of opposite-sex couples,"
Judge Stephen Reinhardt, one of
the court's most liberal judges,
wrote in the 2-1 opinion.
Opponents of gay marriage
planned to ask the Supreme
Court to overturn the ruling,
which came more than a year
after the appeals court panel
heard arguments in the case.
"We are not surprised that
this Hollywood-orchestrated
attack on marriage - tried in San
Francisco - turned out this way.
But we are confident that the
expressed will of the American
people in favor of marriage will
be upheld at the Supreme Court,"
said Brian Raum, senior counsel
for the Alliance Defense Fund, a
Christian legal aid group based
in Arizona that helped defend
Proposition 8.

The Obama Bogeyman

As the Republican presiden-
tial nomination process gets
increasingly nasty,you might

start to hear com-
plaints about one
of the most time-
honored tradi-
tions in politics:
spinning. No, I'm
not talking about
what you do

gym - although

DAR-WEI
CHEN

In light of the recent scandals that shook
other colleges including Penn State University
and Syracuse University, it's imperative that
the University report all incidents in a timely
manner, as long as it does not hinder ongoing
investigations. University officials must be
extra vigilant when dealing with reports of this
nature. Though the Department of Public Safe-
ty doesn't have authority over UMHS security,
some groups, like the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee for University Affairs,,have suggested
changing oversight rules. Lapse in procedure
not only affects the community's safety of the
community but also taints the overall goodwill
that the University works to maintain.
It's some consolation that University

President Mary Sue Coleman called for an
internal investigation to determine the cause
of the delay. Two outside groups - the U.S.
Department of Education and the Joint Com-
mission - are also reviewing the incident.
Clearly, the University is aware that such
a delay in reporting exposes a faulty and
outdated complaint system that warrants
investigation. If the investigation reveals the
complaint process was properly followed, the
University must change the process to ensure
the efficient reporting of crimes. It would be
unfair to attribute this singular case to an
institutional failure of DPS or UHMS, but
the upmost care must be taken to ensure the
well-being of the community.

DANIEL HOFFMANN I
Empower entreprenuers

is exhausting himself pedaling on a
stationary bike. In politics, spinning
is the art of cherry-picking facts and
carefully phrasing ideas for maxi-
mum political gain.
When debating among them-
selves, Republicans usually spin a
lot about each other. However, when
talking about President Barack
Obama, they move to another tactic
that's even slimier than spinning,
which at least includes some fac-
tual basis. The technical term for it
is making stuff up. The goal in mak-
ing stuff up is to scare voters from
Obama.
Now is where the bogeyman
comes in.
Remember when you were a little
kid and your parents told you that if
you didn't behave yourself, a monster
or evil creature would deal with you?
That scary imaginary thing is called
a bogeyman. Bogeymen are created
by parents to scare their children into
doing particular things they don't
want to do .such as cleaning their
room or eatingvegetables.
The particular thing Republicans
want is support for GOP candidates.
But since spinning Obama's record
hasn't been enough for the electoral
changes they want, the Republicans
have started making stuff up to cre-
ate the Obama Bogeyman. Bogeymen
don't actually exist, but they can be

quite effective if forced into the pub-
lic conscience. Let's investigate the
Obama Bogeyman using gun control
as an example.
One trait that all effective bogey-
men share is the ability to strike fear
in the hearts of people, and very few
things are closer to the hearts of.
conservative voters than their guns.
GOP presidential candidate Newt
Gingrich has exploited conserva-
tive voters' fears of Obama coming
for their guns, saying at a National
Rifle Association meeting that "the
Obama administration is the most
consistently anti-gun administration
and anti-Second Amendment admin-
istration that we have ever seen."
Except Obama hasn't been anti-
gun at all. Even in the wake of the
Gabrielle Giffords shooting last
year, when he could have - at the
very least - done something about
extended ammunition clips, he didn't
act. And that's when momentum for
gun control during his presidency
was probably highest.
Another sign of the lack of legis-
lated gun restrictions is the F grade
Obama received from the Brady
Campaign Against Gun Violence in
2010. Shouldn't an F from the Brady
Campaign translate to an A from the
Republicans?
Some conservatives actually admit
that Obama hasn't done anything to
restrict gun usage. But Obama still
can't win even when that happens
because, like any good bogeyman,
he's going to eventually get you.
Last year, National Rifle Association
_Vice President Wayne LaPierre said
Obama's lack of gun regulations is
"part of a massive Obama conspiracy
to deceive voters and hide his true
intentions to destroy the Second.
Amendment," according to NRA
reports. Can Obama win on this issue
if that's how the gun-toting, conser-
vative voting bloc thinks?
Another issue that fires up conser-

vatives is tax policy. To the GOP, high
taxes are never good. Now check
out these statistics: when President
Ronald Reagan tried to bring the
economy out of recession in 1983, tax
revenues were 17.5 percent of GDP.
In the Obama recovery, tax revenues
are 14.9 percent of GDP. Further-
more, Obama extended the massive
Bush tax cuts in 2010 when they were
abouttoexpire -look, it even has the
name Bush in there!
Republicans have
started making
stuff up.
But reality doesn't matter for GOP
talking points or for bogeymen. As
long as the Republicans can scare
people off with the Obama Bogey-
man, whether or not he is actually
raising taxes is immaterial to them.
The same principle applies to his
environmental or foreign policies,
and even his religion and birthplace.
My analyses here are to say noth-
ingabout whether I support Obama's
actions on these issues. Personally,
I'd like to see him move more aggres-
sively on gun control and raise taxes
onthewealthiestamongus.Thepoint
is that, in November, the Republican
presidential candidate won't have to
compete with President Obama. The
nominee will instead run against the
fact-free, imaginary Obama Bogey-
man created by the GOP, making the
candidate's job a little easier. Makes
me wish for the days of old-fashioned
spinning.

Facebook is going public. The scrappy lit-
tle start-up born in a Harvard dorm room in
2004 is now estimated to be worth $100 bil-
lion. In just eight years, the company has built
a user base that is nearly three times the size
of the population of the United States. Face-
book is one of the world's most widely rec-
ognized brands and has become a significant
part of our social lexicon. Its success story is
a tremendous source of inspiration for entre-
preneurs all over the world wishing to launch
their own ventures.
Unfortunately, all the financial figures and
Wall Street jargon surrounding coverage of
Facebook's decision have shifted focus from,
arguably, the most important chapter of the
story: Facebook was started by students. Mark
Zuckerberg and his friends turned their novel
idea into a business that generated $3.71 bil-
lion last year.
The success stories of start-up companies
like Facebook have inspired an entrepreneur-
ial boom on college campuses. The University
is a leader in providing resources and encour-
agement to students looking to start their own
ventures. The Center for Entrepreneurship
offers a nine credit undergraduate certificate
and a Master of Entrepreneurship program,
which provides graduates with a joint degree
in Engineering and Business. The Zell Lurie
Institute in the Ross School of Business offers
funding to students through its Dare to Dream
and Venture Shaping grant programs. Univer-
sity students even have access to office space
and entrepreneurial mentors in the TechArb
in downtown Ann Arbor.
Providing students with the skills and
resources to work on their own projects is
crucial to creating a generation of innovators.
Partnerships between the educational and
entrepreneurial communities couldn't have
come at a better time. With a flagging econ-
omy and a need to find solutions to problems
like energy security and sustainability, entre-
preneurial ingenuity has never been more
important.
According to the U.S. Small Business
Adiinistration - an organization that pro-
vides governmental support to entrepre-
neurs and small business owners -- small
businesses employ about half of all workers
in the United States. They also accounted

for b5 percent of all net job creation between
1993 and 2009. Our economy thrives on the
creativity and drive of small business owners
and entrepreneurs.
Many colleges and universities, includ-
ing the University of Michigan, are tailoring
programs toward the practical application of
entrepreneurial skills. These programs are
crucial and will prepare students to drive the
economy forward in the coming decades.
Encouraging students to develop their own
ventures has turned campuses into a hot bed
for the creation of new endeavors, Doug Neal,
executive director of the Center for Entrepre-
neurship said.
"Entrepreneurship is quickly becoming
part of the fabric of our culture at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, and I'm very excited about
how many students are activelyengaged in our
educational programs, which offer a unique
blend of entrepreneurial frameworks and
theory combined with hands on application
which yield tremendous results," Neal said.
"We are very enthusiastic about the future
of entrepreneurship at Michigan and looking
forward to continuing to help students, fac-
ulty, researchers and staff embrace the entre-
preneurial mindset and identify ways to have
an increasing impact on the world."
Michigan students have plenty of ideas. In
2010, the 1000 Pitches Competition received
more than 3,000 ideas for business ventures,
unique inventions and non-profit organiza-
tions. With the support of University resourc-
es, one of these ideas has the potential to
become the next Facebook, Google or Twitter.
All colleges and universities should offer
opportunities to students who wish to explore
and experiment. Educating students to take
risks and put their ideas to the test will pre-
pare a generation of thinkers and doers
prepared to face today's complex global chal-
lenges. There's no better place to stimulate
creativity and entrepreneurship than college
campuses where students are thirsty to see
their ideas become reality. If a few college
students were able to completely change the
way we communicate with each other, there's
no telling what we can accomplish next.

SHARIK BASHIR I ' WP 'NT
Your9 hl is our 24 7 -

I enjoy watching the Republican
presidential debates. Though, I'm
usually indifferent to the candidate's
views. I'm not American - I'm from
Pakistan. Still, I generally enjoy
mocking the rhetoric and sound bites
used by Republicans, something
characteristic of election season
campaign speeches. But the Jan. 16
GOP debate in South Carolina evoked
a different emotion in me: hurt.
It was former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich that got to me. He
was enthused as ever. When the
topic of Pakistan came up, I became
particularly alert to what he was
saying. He alluded to the mission
that killed Osama Bin Laden in
Abbottabad last May and accused
Pakistan of supporting the al-Qaeda
leader. To put it mildly, Gingrich
called Pakistan an enemy of the
United States. As he spoke, loud
cheers erupted from the debate's
audience. His performance in the
debate was bombastic. The cheers
transferred to votes as Gingrich
snatched South Carolina right out
of Mitt Romney's grasp.
But his view on Pakistan was
painful to hear. It was ignorant
to the massive sacrifices Pakistan
has made as a country on the front
line of the Wr on Terror, and was
ungrateful for Pakistan's efforts.
In Pakistan, the War on Ter-
ror seems more like Pakistan's war
than America's. Since 9/11, Pakistan
has suffered much heavier losses
than the United States as a result
of the war. According to a Paki-
stani security report last year, there
were 10,003 deaths from violent

incidents in 2010 and another 7,107
in 2011 alone. An advertisement by
Pakistan in the Wall Street Journal
on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11
attacks read that 21,672 Pakistanis
have lost their lives as a result of
the war. The investment and losses
faced by the U.S. pale in comparison
to losses Pakistan has suffered.
There is a common protest slogan
in Pakistan, "Your 9/11 is our 24/7."
I can attest to that. On Nov. 11,2010,
I was watching television in the
living room with my family. Sud-
denly a shockwave swept through,
rattling my house. My father fell
off the sofa, ducking for cover. The
doors were unhinged and blades of
glass shot out from the shattering
windows. A 1,000-kilogram bomb
had exploded at a police center
nearby. There was no surprise as to
who the perpetrators were.
What may come as a surprise to
most people is the mood that pre-
vailed in my home afterwards. It
was apathy. This has become such
a common occurrence. This is the
ground reality in my home and
country. We have become used
to such incidents and are suffer-
ing daily because of this war that,
according to Gingrich, Pakistan
isn't cooperating in.
In an interview with CBS News,
Pakistan's ambassador to the U.N.,
Abdullah Hussain Haroon, cited
World Bank statistics claiming that
Pakistan has spent $150 billion on
this war. Even if you don't accept
this number and the U.S.-given fig-
ure is $20 billion. Haroon also said,
"We have invested 50 to 60 years of

the best periods of our life in (the
U.S.) and today we are getting treat-
ed like a pariah."
This is true. Pakistan and the
United States have been allies since
Pakistan entered the realm of foreign
policy. Pakistan was instrumental in
fighting against the Soviet commu-
nists in Afghanistan, and today it's a
crucial partner of the United States
against the Taliban forces on both
sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan
border. The Express Tribune, a Paki-
stani newspaper, reported that more
than 200,000 troops were deployed
on the front line, and 90,000 Paki-
stani troops are fighting across the
border on the ground. Pakistan has
dedicated many air bases inside its
territory to the U.S. for launching
drone attacks - attacks that some-
times kill innocent civilians along
with militants. In the words of
Haroon, "you cannot solve Afghani-
stan without Pakistan."
I hope that next time before
jumping to conclusions about where
Pakistan's loyalties lie, people
reconsider the statistics. Instead of
alienating your allies, support us.
We stand on the same side in this
fight. I would encourage voters to
make a wise decision when choos-
ingthe best candidate for president.
Choose a candidate who is not bel-
ligerent. Pick someone who can
appreciate the sacrifices of your
allies, someone who can show some
respect and empathize with those
who suffer and fight for not only
their own, but your safety too.

LSA freshman Alex Kokaly
said he believes in the poten-
tial of the upcoming Go North!

will take the journey to North

"I think the main challenge is
getting the people who live on
Central to make the trek up to
North Campus, but my friends
and I are always willing to do
something fun," Kokaly said.
Engineering freshman Isaiah
Murray, who lives in the Baits I
Residence Hall, said he thinks
the new events from Go North!
may help alter negative feelings
toward North Campus.
"I think that people get the
misconception that because
North Campus is ... outside of
(central campus) that there's
nothing to do up here," Murray
said. "Something like Winter
Blast could possibly change that
outlook a little bit."
The show left the crowd
cheering and audience members
were visibly excited to see stu-
dent athletes perform on stage
instead of the field.
Engineering junior Nick Ber-

mance and found it to be one the

The bombardment of Homs, the hot bedof the resistance to President Bashar Assad's regime, has intensified over recent
days, after Syria's allies Russia and China vetoed a Western and Arab-backed resolution at the United Nations.

"Necessary reforms must be

Assad replied that Syria is
determined to hold a national
dialogue with the opposition and
independent figures, saying his
government was "ready to coop-
erate with any effort that boosts
stability in Syria," according to
the Syrian state news agency
SANA.
Repeated efforts by the Arab
League and Russia to broker
talks have been rejected by the
Syrian opposition, which refuses
any negotiations while the crack-
down continues. The opposition
has also said Assad's proposed
reforms, including a new consti-
tution and eventual multiparty
elections, are aimed at keeping
his hold on power.
In yesterday's talks, Assad
told Lavrov that Russia's posi-
tion has played "a key role in sav-
ing our motherland," according
to ITAR-Tass.
As Lavrov's convoy snaked its
way along Damascus' Mazzeh
Boulevard, it was greeted by a
sea of Assad supporters cheering
the vetoes at the U.N.
"Thank you Russia and
China," read one banner that
had photos of Assad and the
Russian president. Many stood
in the rain carrying Syrian flags
as well as the red, blue and white
Russian banner.
"I am hereto thank Russia for
its stand in the face of the world
conspiracy against Syria," said
Manya Abbad, 45. "I wish the
Arabs adopted similar stances."
The Assad regime says terror-
ists acting out a foreign conspir-
acy to destabilize the country
are behind the uprising, not
people seeking to transform the
authoritarian regime.
But in the flashpoints of the
conflict, witnesses, residents
and human rights workers say
Assad's forces are shelling and
firing indiscriminately. The
troops renewed their assault
yesterday on one of the main
centers of the opposition, the
city of Homs, with activists say-
ing tanks were closing in on a
restive neighborhood.


*CSG
From Page 1A
discussed the upcoming Lansing
Blitz, a collaborative event with
other colleges in the state to fos-
ter discussion of student issues.
CSG President DeAndree
Watson said he was glad to see
some of those vacancies filled
and to increase representation
within the Assembly.
"It's extremely important that
people who are elected show
up to meetings," he said. "I'm
also excited that we have good
relationships with the school
and college governments who
are standing ready to fill those
vacancies when they do exist so
that we can make sure we always
have an adequate (amount of)
students who are here repre-
senting the voices of the stu-
dents."
The Assembly has the capac-
ity to have 57 sitting representa-
tives, but not every school and
college sends, or even elected,
the representatives available
to them. The University Medi-

cal School, the School of Public
Health, the School of Natural
Resources and the Environment,
the Taubman College of Archi-
tecture & Urban Planning, the
Ford School of Public Policy and
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance do not send representa-
tives to Assembly meetings.
Sean Walser, chairman of
CSG's External Relations Com-
mission, attended the meeting to
discuss Lansing Blitz, which is
slated to take place in late March
and will provide an opportunity
for students from the state's 15
public universities to meet with
state legislators in Lansing to
advocate for issues pertinent to
students.
Walser said CSG is currently
planning on spending $1,000 to
pay for two University buses to
take students to Lansing for the
two-day event. Walser said he
and other members of CSG are
discussing logistics of the event
with student organizations
including the University's chap-
ter of College Democrats, the
University's chapter of College
Republicans and the Michigan

Political Union.
Watson said the event is an
opportunity to provide a forum
for students to voice issues
they've experienced, and devel-
op ways to overcome them.
"I'm really excited that we're
going to provide an opportunity
for students to voice their con-
cerns directly to the people in
Lansing," Watson said. "Hear-
ing directly from a large group
of students simultaneously will
get that message to them loud
and clear."
Only one resolution, a pro-
posal to hold a joint meeting
between the University Council,
a CSG council created in 2010
composed of delegates from dif-
ferent schools to connect the
University Activity Center to
other school's student govern-
ments, and the Student Assem-
bly, was discussed. There were
also no speakers for Community
Concerns, a portion of the meet-
ing that typically lasts anywhere
from 10 to 30 minutes and allows
members of the University and
Ann Arbor community to dis-
cuss issues.

Exactly a month after earning
MVP honors at the Sugar Bowl
in New Orleans on Jan. 3, former
Michigan wide receiver Junior
Hemingway had it alltaken away.
Friday, Hemingway had
numerous valuables stolen from
the home of his father, Kenneth
EarlHemingway, indConway, S.C.,
according to myrtlebeachonline.
com.
The following things were
taken from the home, according
to the report:
' Gator Bowl watch valued at
$1,000
" Sugar Bowl watch valued at
" East/West Shrine Game
watchvalued at $1,000
" Silver watch valued at $1,200
" Gold watch valued at $500
e Outback Bowl ring valued at

" Gold diamond ring valued at
$800
* Gold initial ring with a K on it
valued at $500
" Two video gaming systems
and controllersvalued at $759
" Eleven video games valued at
$400
* A55-inch TV valued at $1,200
The report stated that crime
scene officers took fingerprints
for processing and photos were
taken of the home, which was
"left in disarray."
Hemingway finished his
fifth-year senior season with the
Michigan football team with 34
catches for 699 yards and four
touchdowns.
He was invited to compete
in the NFL combine later this
month in Indianapolis.

against the Spartans, and his
four points were a season-low.
But that performance wasn't
entirely unexpected - all season,
especially in Big Ten games, the
Miami native hasn't looked like
the sharpshooter he became dur-
ing conference play last year.
His struggles on Sunday mean
Hardaway Jr. is now 10-for-36
in his last three games and he is
shooting just 21.3 percent from
deep in conference games.
Worse yet, the sophomore has
let his offensive struggles affect
the rest his game, slacking on the
boards and regressing defensive-
ly. Hardaway Jr. has taken ques-
tionable shots, and Beilein said
the guard needs to let the game
come to him instead of forcing
things. But that's difficult when
someone puts as much pressure
on himself as Hardaway Jr. does.
"He really wants to be the ulti-
mate perfect player, and no one
is," Beilein said. "We just con-
tinue to work at that - that it's

not about perfection, it's about
excellence, of getting better, of
growth. And like I said, he's very
receptive to those things. We've
just got to continue to work at it."
Though Michigan (7-4,17-7) is
unfamiliar with the Cornhusk-
ers, Nebraska is far from a bas-
ketball version of the Mona Lisa.
Nebraska hasn't impressed the
conference much in its inaugural
season in the Big Ten, currently
sitting in 11th place in the league
standings.
The Cornhuskers are led by
one of the more solid scoring
threats in the Big Ten in guard Bo
Spencer, who averages 15.5 points
per game. Spencer is surrounded
by a veteran-laden lineup - three
of the team's other starters are
fellow seniors and the fourth is a
junior.
But other than a home win
against Indiana, Nebraska hasn't
beaten anyone of note in the con-
ference and lostits last two games
to Northwestern and Minnesota.

The biggest challenge for the
Wolverines may be adapting to
the Cornhuskers' offense, which
is more wide-open and relies less
on set plays than most of Michi-
gan's foes.
"It'llbe one of those personnel-
driven games," said senior guard
Stu Douglass. "There's some sets
they run, but alot of (the offense)
is transition. They have some
1-on-1 scorers, and they got great
options on the perimeter that can
make plays. It'll take our whole
focus.
"It's different going from play-
ingsets to playing individual play-
ers. It takes a different mindset."
The good news for the Wol-
verines is that they've completed
their toughest six-game stretch of
the season, bookended by Michi-
gan State. The team went 3-3 in
that span, and though that's a
solid mark against such difficult
competition, Douglass admitted
that such inconsistency has been
frustrating.

With a relatively easier sched-
ule the rest of way, Michigan has
an opportunity to make some
headway in the conference -- and
it begins in Lincoln on Wednes-
daynight.
"We're in a better position
than we were last year," Douglass
said. "Last year, we needed the
string of wins. You don't neces-
sarily need them (now), but we
do need to build momentum as
we head into a hopeful NCAA
berth."
INJURIES: Just 11 players
will make the trip to Nebraska.
Sophomore forward Jon Horford,
whose redshirt looks increasing-
ly likely, will stay home.
So will freshman point guard
Carlton Brundidge, who is still
dealing with an asthma-related
illness.
Meanwhile, the Cornhus-
ers will once again be without
backup center Jorge Brian Diaz.
Sadler said Diaz is likely out the
rest of the season.

DeBlois leads scrappy penalty kill

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team
wouldn't be successful if it was
littered with flashy offensive
playmakers that cared about
defense as much as Wes Welker
cares for Gisele Bundchen. The
Michigan hockey program is
built of scrappy, two-way for-
wards that enjoy the dirty work
as much as the offensive glory.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
stresses the importance of these
two-way forwards perhaps more
than any other type of player on
the roster, and he has no qualms
about rewarding those players.
Senior forward Luke Glendening
is the captain, and he has never
scored more than eight goals in a
season.
And against Miami (Ohio) last
weekend, Derek DeBlois showed
why the two-way forward is so
important.
For the casual observer, it
might have seemed that DeBlois
didn't do much. The sophomore
forward didn't appear on the stat
sheet and was an even zero in
the plus/minus category in both
games.
But DeBlois was a lynchpin
Â° on a stellar penalty-kill unit that
scored a shorthanded goal and
didn't allow a goal on 12 power
plays. DeBlois was all over the
ice, breaking up shots and leaving
his impact on the boards.
"I thought he was a stud, one
of the best guys on the ice," said
sophomore defenseman Mac
Bennett. "We had to kill a lot of
penalties and that's one of his
strong points, so he really got a
* chance to shine. The penalty kill
speaks for itself, and he's a big
part of that."
A lot of credit for the unit's
turnaround has been given to
sophomore defenseman Jon Mer-
rill, rightfully so.
But the penalty-kill unit is
composed of guys like DeBlois,
who sacrifice the glory of being
an offensive stalwart in order to
help the team on the defensive
end. He has scored just five goals
on the season - and only one in

Examining the next step for Borseth and the Wolverines

ive years ago, Kevin Bors-
eth came to Ann Arbor to
jL become the eighth head
coach of the Michigan women's
basketball program.
He inherited a program that
dwelled near the bottom of the
Big Ten for a half decade and
hadn't made an NCAA Tourna-
ment appear-
ance since COLLEEN
2001. His THOMAS
teams showed
promise in On Women's
each of his Basketball
first four
years, but slow finishes hindered
any shot at a tournament berth.
This season, the team hopes to
change that story.
After posting a program-best
12-2 record to open this season,
the Wolverines appeared to be
a contender for the Big Ten title
and finally earn a spot in the
tournament.
But in conference play, it's
looked like the same old story
for Borseth's squad.
Michigan has dropped games
to good teams in Penn State and
Michigan State - the Wolver-
ines haven't beaten the Spartans

since 2008 - and sub-par Wis-
consin in the last three weeks,
and it began to look like the
Wolverines were going to have
another breakdown near the end
of the season.
But there still is time to turn
the season back in the right
direction. If they want to take
that next step and earn a tour-
nament bid, the remaining five
games will be the most impor-
tant of the season.
If you compare last season's
and this season's conference
records, this year's squad is
behind last year's.
Michigan is currently 6-5 in
the Big Ten, whereas last year
at this point, Wolverines were
one game better. Michigan will
have to go 4-1 over the next five
games in order to have the same
conference record as last year -
and matching last year's effort
may not even be enough.
With opponents such as
Nebraska and Purdue still loom-
ing, the Wolverines have to take
their game to the next level by
beating the best teams in the Big
Ten. And that starts with beat-
ing the Huskers on Thursday.

They also have a home-and-
home series against Iowa that
can help them gain momentum
for the postseason.
The Hawkeyes maybe just
14-10 overall, but they're tied
with the Wolverines in the Big
Ten standings at 6th, just below
Michigan State. Iowa has beaten
Purdue on the road, and the
Huskers beat the Boilermakers
in triple overtime last week.
The Big Ten may be a mess right
now, but the Wolverines can
straighten it all out by simply
winning these games.
There are a few stipulations,
though. Senior guard Courtney
Boylan has cooled off after a hot
start in nonconference play, and
senior guard Carmen Reynolds
has been unpredictable all sea-
son.:
Those two were two of the
team's leading scorers last
year, but they haven't produced
this season, which has been a
problem for Michigan. Instead,
junior forward Rachel Shef-
fer has taken the reigns of the
offense and is now the Wolver-
ines' leading scorer.
Sheffer has come up big in

some of Michigan's games, but
one player doesn't constitute a
team.
There are five players on the
floor, and all five need to con-
tribute for the team to be suc-
cessful. Boylan and Reynolds
are two pieces to that puzzle. As
seniors, they have the leadership
capabilities and the experience
to know what needs to be done
down the stretch.
They know what it's like to
hit a low - they lost to the worst
team in the Big Ten last year in
the conference tournament. In
order to make this season differ-
ent than the rest, they have to
take control.
The senior duo has shown
its potential. Boylan tallied a
career-high 22 points in Sun-
day's loss to Michigan State,
and Reynolds has gotten back
in stride after setting the pro-
gram's 3-point record. That
offensive production needs to
continue.
Sheffer, Boylan, and Reynolds
make three. There are two more
pieces in junior guard Jenny
Ryan and the Wolverines' bench,
but those aren't a problem for

Michigan. Ryan has consistently
contributed around the board
all season, especially on defense,
and the bench - whether it be
juniors Kate Thompson or Sam
Arnold - can step up in any
situation.
So it all comes down to the
seniors. Leadership and expe-
rience are two things a coach
can't teach, but they are things
Boylan and Reynolds possess
and have to use in order to finish
strong in the last five games.
Right now, ESPN's Bracketol-
ogy has Michigan as a 10-seed.
Earlier in the season, they were
as high as a seven. It's gener-
ous listing, though, as the same
bracket has both Michigan State
and Iowa as two of the First
Four Out. The Spartans swept
the Wolverines already and are
higher in the conference stand-
ings.
The Wolverines' nonconfer-

ence play was one of the best
of any team in the Big Ten. But
that has passed, and it again
comes down to the last push for
the team to gain a spot in the
64-team field.
The seniors have been here
before, and it's their job to make
this season different.
Borseth understands all of
this.
"Everything is at stake right
now," he said. "(The difference
between missing the tourna-
ment) last year, two wins. The
year before, two wins. The year
before that, one win. That's
what-it comes down to, getting
your win total up.
"You have to do well at the
end of the season - that's what
you're judged on. We've laid the
groundwork in the nonconfer-
ence, and now we need to be
able to clos.e the deal here in our
conference play."

TV REVIEW
MTVWears 'Pants' well

Hilarious cast
pleasantly surprises
in raunchy comedy
By BRIANNE JOHNSON
Daily Arts Writer
Nobody wants to admit ,they

funny? Seek shelter and sharpen
the cries for long-lost music vid-
eos! But it's true - MTV gives
viewers exactly what they need
and revisits the neglected realm
of scripted television with Thurs-
day night's fist-pump-free "I Just
Want My Pants Back."
Based on the novel by David
J. Rosen, "I Just Wants My
Pants Back" follows Jason Strid-
er (Peter Vack, "As the World
Turns"), stuck in a less-than-
satisfactory entry-level position
at a New York casting agency and
plagued by a painful six-week
dry spell - so painful that poor
Jason can barely "remember
what sex smells like." Climbing
his way from rock bottom, Jason
meets Jane, the soon-to-be-elu-
sive "Fridge Girl." After a quick
exchange of witty banter and

"That's some good looking no-no juice."

"We should try it in the blender next."
drinks, the two, hunched in the
comfort of Jason's refrigerator,
exchange something else - bodi-
ly fluids. Broccoli is an aphrodi-
siac, right? One sunrise later, the
one-night stand steals off with
Jason's jeans, leaving him with-
out alife plan or a pair of pants.
Each joke whizzes by as
"Pants" churns out humor of all
kinds: subtle remarks, witty (and
some not-so-wyitty) puns, pop-
culture-conscious comments,
snide retorts and delightfully
raunchy allusions. Despite the
risk of falling into the stereotypi-
cal "teen-y" ranks of "Skins" or
"My Life as Liz," "Pants" dodges
over-the-top attempts at relat-
ability and edge. Shockingly, the
show succeeds in evoking laughs.
That's right - not a slight snort
or throaty chuckle, but a literal

"LOL." After a sloppy enter-
tainment lawyer urges Jason to
stick his thumb in a previously
uncharted orifice, he heads to the
local store for a splint, complain-
ing that "her sphincter had the
grip of a merchant marine."
Yet at times, "Pants" may be
trying a little too hard, as illus-
trated by buxom friend Tina
Bradley (Kim Shaw, "She's Out of
My League"). An overwhelming,
overdone portrait of the hot-girl-
with-a-male-brain, Tina is quick
to spit obviously over-thought
lines, such as "take the deal, oth-
erwise a handjob is a man's job
and you can get out at the light
and mind my vagina." Mother
Goose must have excluded that,
one from her collection.
Instead, Jason holds the real
charm, like a cuter Andy Sam-

berg itt desperate need of a hair-
cut (and maybe a dose of reality).
Despite his lazy ways, Jason is
an incredibly likeable character,
playful and optimistic despite his
pants-less circumstances. Vack is
endearingly genuine, portraying
the protagonist with a subtle vul-
nerability and casual demeanor.
His character seems far more
"real" than the manicured "reali-
ty" casts MTV has manufactured
for years.
Strider may have described his
fridge-humping hook-up as "cute,
funny, and surprisingly filthy,"
but such compliments apply more
so to the new Thursday night
favorite, "I Just Want My Pants
Back." After the spray tans of the
"Shore" and the solemn-faced
squabbles of "The Hills," MTV
has finally done something right.

TV REVIEW
'Revenge' still bringing depth
and deftness to soap format

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Senior ArtsEditor
If you've ever wished that the
opportunistic, corrupt social-
ites who remained financially
unharmed by
the economic.
crisis finally
had their assets Revenge
served to them
on a silver Midseason
platter, your Wednesdays
modern-day at10 p.m.
Robin Hood A
has arrived in ABC
a cocktail dress
and heels. ABC's new thriller-
drama '"Revenge" shatters the
idyllic picture of carefree Hamp-
tons living by weaving a complex
but controlled web packed with
dark twists and surprises.
To the gossipy Hamptons
inhabitants of "Revenge," Emily
Thorne (Emily VanCamp, "Ever-
wood") is just the pretty, wealthy
new girl who has decided to
spend hersummer on the beach.
In actuality, Emily is an antihero
on a mission to avenge her father
David Clarke (James Tupper,
"Grey's Anatomy") by taking out
the players who framed him for
a crime he didn't commit. Her
friendly, warm facade allows her
to smoothly ease her way into the
lives of the people who haven't
seen her since Child Protec-
tive Services took her away and
placed her father in jail for trea-
son and laundering money for
terrorists. Her father dies in pris-
on but leaves behind a collection
of documents, video tapes and
photos that prove his innocence
and implicate the Hamptons'
residing royal family: Victoria
(Madeleine Stowe, "Raines") and
Conrad Grayson (Henry Czerny,
"The Tudors").
Emily, whose real naime is

Amanda Clarke, uses her father's
evidence to draw a roadmap of.
revenge. She concocts a won-
derfully complex plan to deal
out personalized forms of retri-
bution to everyone responsible
for her father's demise, target-
ing whatever or whomever they
value most. Almost every epi-
sode follows a similar formula:
Emily zeroes in on her victim
of the week, and after a series
of obstacles, destroys their life.
This could easily become tir-
ing, and most soapy dramas suf-
fer from their formulaic arcs,
but the writers of "Revenge"
know exactly when to throw in
a game-changing twist to pro-
pel the story forward or focus in
on a specific character to spend
time on development and depth.
This balanced movement makes
for strong storytelling and char-
acter development, which is why
it's hard to classify "kIevenge" as
a primetime soap - these char-
acters are fully realized, the sto-
ries are carefully plotted, and
the twists are shocking but still
grounded in a sense of plausibil-
ity and connectedness.
While the acting of the sup-
porting cast can sometimes be
melodramatic and vapid, the
leading ladies of "Revenge" are
a main reason that the show is
so addicting and exciting. Van-
Camp plays both sides of Emily
so expertly that the character's.
moments of earnestness seem
completely honest, yet her sud-
denbut fluid transformations into
a cold, calculating schemer are
just as convincing. Emily starts
dating Daniel (Joshua Bowman,
"Make It Or Break It"), son of
the all-powerful Graysons, and
it's still unclear if he's only a part
of her plan or if she really has
fallen in love with him. With the
elegant way VanCamp captures

ByKAYLA UPADHYAYA
SeniorArts Editor
You know that old saying,
"don't judge a television show by
its title?" No? OK, so maybe it's
not as popular as the real saying
about book covers, but it's a valid
point. With the multitude of
fantastic series floating around
the TV world these days, it can
be difficult to pick and choose
what we want to tune into every
week, and it's tempting to sort,
select and reject based on the
surface-level details: the cast,
the promos, the premise and the
title. This tendency has made it
difficult for me to recommend
the show "Cougar Town" with-
out being met with doubtful gri-
maces and judgmental badger
faces.
Yes, I agree, "Cougar Town"
is probably the stupidest title
of any show currently on air,
rivaled only by "The Vam-
pire Diaries." But just like the
supernatural CW drama, the
title isn't only dumb, it's entire-
ly misleading (I promise you,
the vampires stop writing in
their diaries circa the 5th epi-
sode of the series). Though the
first few episodes of "Cougar
Town" center around recently
divorced Jules Cobb (Courteney
Cox, "Friends") and her various
attempts at dating younger men,
the show has since morphed into
something entirely different,
making a lot of viewers wonder
why the title made itnto the page.
The cast even put forth sugges-
tions for alternative names.
"Cougar Town" isn't about
Courteney Cox vying for stud-
ly 20-somethings. It's about a
close-knit group of adult friends
- dubbed the "Cul-de-Sac
Crew" - who have a lot of fun
and drink a lot of wine.
It sounds simple, because it
is. Most of the comedy comes
directly from the interactions
among different combinations
of the Cul-de-Sac Crew. Put-
ting any two of these characters
in even the simplest of situa-
tions leads to hilarity. Jules's
two best friends - the feisty,
speed-talking Laurie (Busy
Philipps, "Freaks- and Geeks")
and the ever-crabby and judg-
mental Ellie (Christa Miller,
"Scrubs") - hate each other
and engage in daily insult bat-
i ties. Ele's husband Andy (Ian
Gomez, "Royal Pains") has an
over-the-top friend-crush on
Jules's ex-husband Bobby (Brian
Van Holt, "Entourage"), who
lives on a boat and has a golf
cart in lieu of a car. The cyni-
cal bartender Grayson (Josh
Hopkins, "Private Practice")
often acts like he wants nothing
.to do with Jules and her crazy
friends, but he quickly converts
into a full-fledged member of
the gang - watching "American
Idol," chugging wine and writ-
ing songs, (his top hits include
"Confident in My Sexuality"
and "It's Part of Being a Couple
- Remix").. Jules's pragmatic
teenage son Travis (Dan Byrd,
"Heroes") serves as the straight
man most of the time, calmly
explaining to the adults in his

life that "morning drinking"
probably isn't the best idea.
An ensemble show like "Cou-
gar Town" is nothing without a
well-meshed cast, and comedy
veteran Courteney Cox hardly
outshines her co-stars. Philipps
brings vibrant energy to her
delivery of all of Laurie's wild
stories, ramblings and words of
wisdom ("I have a rule that every
kiss should last three seconds -
it's what the Obamas do").
Speaking of "Scrubs," even
though this show has a different
premise and formula from Bill
Lawrence's past work, the dia-
logue, tone and jokes of "Cougar
Town" are distinctly Lawrence-
esque, reminiscent of this com-
edy master's beloved medical
sitcom. The Cul-de-Sac Crew
isn't all that different from the
Sacred Heart bunch in the ways
they interact and develop recur-
ring inside jokes. The characters
of "Cougar Town" make up the
game "Penny Can" - literally
consisting of throwing pennies
into cans - which reminds me
of all the absurd games J.D. and
Turk used to play, such as "Find
the Saltine" and "Toe or Finger."
On Valentine's Day, Ellie and
Grayson engage in a Janitor vs.
J.D.-like prank battle, ending
with Grayson littering Ellie's
whole house and front yard with
obnoxious Christmas decora-
tions. If you liked the pacing
and character arcs of "Scrubs,"
you're sure to find a familiar
home in "Cougar Town."
A game of
Penny Can,

When Bill Lawrence alluded
to the possibility of "Cougar
Town" changing its name, I was
torn. On the one hand, the show
has been in constant danger of
cancellation and returns next
week after a long hiatus filled
with uncertainty for fans. Law-
rence noted on his Twitter that
the title is certainly a contribut-
ing factor to the show's low rat-
ings. The term "cougar" is also
offensive and problematic, and
have I mentioned it has noth-
ingto do with the show? But I've
become attached to the ridicu-
lous name. I no longer whisper
"I love 'Cougar Town' "out of
shame, because you know what?
It's a downright hilarious and
heartwarmingshow about fami-
ly and friendship that frequently
outshines "Modern Family" in
its ability to take simple stories
and charge them with smart,
feel-good comedy.
Yes, the titles "Friends With
Beverages" and "Wine Town"
are far more accurate, and if a
name change means the show
gets to stick around a little lon-
ger, I'm all for it. I guess I just
wish people could look past
the name and see the show
for what it is - a cougar-free,
wine-infused (penny) can full of
laughs.

What are your plans for Valentine's Day?
by Kaitlin Williams
Valentine's Day - some call it a scam manufactured by Hallmark. Some
swoon and get engaged. Some scoff at the mainstream holiday and buy dis-
counted candy the day after. Yet others cast off their reservations about love
and make reservations at fancy restaurants with their significant others. How-
ever you decide to spend this random upcoming Tuesday, seize the day for
whatever you want it to mean to you. Make it a Mother's Day preview and call
up your mom to tell her you love her. Give your best girl friend a flower. Tape
hearts all over a stranger's dorm room door. Just because some guy wrote love
letters in prison doesn't mean you have to commit a crime and get locked up to
seize the passion of this February day, do a dramatic reading of Walt Whitman
for your current crush or buy a Walt Whitman chocolate sampler. Take a page
from the stories told in these pictures and reach out your hand to someone you
love. Nothing warms the heart like the heat of two hands interlocked.

"The more important question is not whether $3,000should be spent on
school supplies, but whether that investment would better improve student
achievement than student placement with a TFA teacher... The goal of edu-
cation is not to protect the jobs of low performing or ineffective teachers."

Welcome to the Random Student
Interview, where we run around
without clothes on.
Hey, what's up? How are you
today?
I'm good. Kind of a rough morning,
what about you?
A lot of the same. I got a stupid
parking ticket this morning on
North Campus. Do you think I
have to pay it?
Oh man, they get you every time up
there! I go to the School of Art &
Design and I always get them. It's
the worst. You can pay them online
though. I know because I get them
so frequently, it's my homepage.
I'm pretty sure I give Ann Arbor
more money than the actual tax-
payers.
Any special plans for Valentine's
Day?
I don't know yet. I'm probably
going to eata lot of chocolate that I
bought myself.
Are you seeing anyone special?
He's definitely "special," but you
know, nothing special.
I wonder how he got into the
University ofMichigan, then.
How long have you guys been
together? Long enough to score
some good Valentine's Day gifts?
I wouldn't be expecting anything
radical from this guy, butI also
wouldn't turn anything down
either.
What have been some of your


favorite Valentine's Day gifts
that you've received in the past?
In the fourth grade, Cody [redact-
ed] gave me two Starbursts and a
tattoo necklace. It was pretty awe-
some.
Did you end up dating him?
No, he broke up with me like two
weeks later for Jiovanna [redact-
ed]. I'll never forget it - clearly,
since I remember both their full
names. It really traumatized me. I
stopped eating Starbursts.
Ouch. What is the worst gift
you've ever received?
Does no gift count? One time I
received a gym membership, which
was weird.
I really cannot believe that. How
does that even happen? Who
were you seeing?
I know. There's a story behind it,
but basically I kept going to my
sister's gym as her guest and I
had been abusing the privileges
for weeks. She was only allowed
maybe five guest passes and I think
I went 15 times. So finally, after
flirting with some of the guys at
the front desk, they gave me a free
month membership as a mock
"Valentine's Day gift" incentive.
Do you still go? Or more impor-
tantly, do you pay?
I kept going until the summer
months began when they pretty
much cornered me and were like
"OK, this has been fun watching
you run around in short shorts, but
seriously, you have to start paying
for a membership now or we're

gonna start kicking you out." I was
too embarrassed to go back after
that, so I switched and started pay-
ing for one closer to my house.
But you weren't embarrassed
,about running around in short
shorts?
You do what you gotta do. It
worked for a while. And it was
totally worth it. (Laughs) I was,
like, 17, and I thought it was cool.
Interesting. Have you heard
about the Walk of Shame Shut-
tle?
Yeah, I saw it posted on someone's-
wall on Facebook. Sounds like a
great idea. I want to use it to go to
breakfast or something afterwards.
I think it's pretty genius, but I don't
know if I'd actually use it or just
call a friend.
It also sounds mildly unsanitary.
Yeah, I guess the driver would
have to seriously wipe down the

A day at the mercy of strangers' food suggestions
By Chloe Stachowiak

've never been to The Chop House.
When I'm rushing to or from class
with an empty stomach, Thai food
doesn't even cross my mind. Like
many of my peers, I reach for a sure thing
when I'm hungry. In fact, my Ann Arbor
eating is almost exclusively limited to a
handful of sushi places (depending on
which one I'm closest to) and the- occa-
sional salad from Panera. I rarely branch
out from this handful of restaurants, and
when I do, it's usually with a friend who
is, for whatever reason, sick of sushi and
Panera salads.
But I can't help but think I'm missing out
on something - that an entire world of cafes,
sandwich shops, and restaurants exists out-
side my tuna roll and chicken salad palate.
After all, aside from a few office buildings
and parking structures, what is our down-
town district but a mecca of upscale (and
overpriced) eateries? Am I the only person
in Ann Arbor who doesn't take advantage of
these dining opportunities?
I decided to seek out these answers the
only way I knew how: by putting my appetite
in strangers' hands. For an entire day, Iasked
people off the streets where to go for each
meal and what to order - no Panera allowed.
10:30 a.m.
My Saturday morning started on South
University Avenue. Though I was sport-
ing bleary black eye makeup from the night
before, I didn't shy away from asking for
breakfast suggestions from the trendiest
person I could find: a Burberry-clad woman
in sunglasses who was the perfect comple-
ment to her breakfast suggestion - Sava's for
the Parfait French Toast.
Though I'd never stepped foot inside
Sava's, I should have known that the

woman's appearance was a precursor to
the classy establishment awaiting me. The
leather gloves. The oversized shades. The
lipstick at such an early hour. This woman
obviously leads a classier life than I do, and
this unfortunate truth unveiled itself the
second I stepped inside the clean, crisp and
well-lit restaurant. Everything was just too
polished.
The French toast I ordered was just as
intimidating as the ritzy atmosphere, piled
high with creamy yogurt, artfully arranged
berries and pompousness. Nothing about the
flavor itself wowed me. Despite the glamor-
ous appearance and price tag, it tasted exact-
ly like a piece of bread smothered in dairy
and fruit.
So maybe the dish wouldn't be showing up
in my dreams anytime soon - a phenomenon
my waiter had claimed to experience regu-
larly. But at least it looked pretty.
2:30 p.m.
My next meal felt a little closer to home,
thanks to advice from a group of students I
met taking a smoke break on a Kerrytown
porch.
"You have to go to Jerusalem Garden,
get the falafel sandwich," instructed the
leader of the porch posse, shielding her
bleach-blonde hair from the wind. "And
you have to get it with hummus and hot
sauce."
"It's just an Ann Arbor original," added
her hairy friend in a voice as serious as his
grizzly beard. "It's not like one of those
cookie-cutter pita chips and hummus plac-
es. You can get that shit anywhere in this
town."
The small, sunny restaurant was a nice
change from the spread of Sava's, but Istill
felt a little bummed at my porch friends'

suggestion.
It's not like anything was wrong with
the food - the hummus was creamy and
the falafel deep-fried to perfection - but
my time there just didn't feel out of the
ordinary.
There was no mystery, no stressful-
yet-exciting hunts through the menu, or
the "let's all order different things so we
can share" deals among groups of friends.
Everyone there knew exactly what they
wanted and what they were getting.
What's the fun in that?
6:45 p.m.
Lunch was a little less inspiring than I
had expected, but I had faith that my luck
would change when dinner rolled around.
Maybe someone would instruct me to go
somewhere fancy, where patrons wore
real pants in lieu of leggings and entrees
cost more than six dollars. And maybe, just
maybe, that place would serve medium-
rare steaks.
But it seemed that fate and I just weren't
on the same page. My dinner assignment
was Panchero's Mexican Grill, the home of
midnight munchies, belligerent conversa-
tions and everything that comes with an
embarrassing night of South U partying. A
low price and DIY thrill, according to Sam,
the curly-headed guy I met outside Espres-
so Royale on State Street.
"The townie secret is to order a side of
beans, rice and a tortilla," he insisted, "and
then just make it into a burrito yourself.
It's cheaper than just ordering something
off their menu."
Needless to say, I was skeptical. What
could the fast food Tex Mex place offer me
that a local restaurant couldn't, especially
when my BAC was "in the blue?"

Admittedly, my Panchero's experience
was almost exciting at first. I felt like I was
cheating the system as I stood behind the
burrito bar. At any moment a cook could
point his leathery finger and expose me for
the penny-pincher I was. But that never
happened, and it only took one bite of my 4
makeshift burrito to drain its badass thrill.
It was as lackluster and bland as it sounds
- a mushy pile of.carbs that lacked even
the simple touch of cheese or salsa. This is
what townies eat for dinner?
Epilogue
And, like that, nine hours and 25 dollars
passed me by. The part of me that wasn't
totally bloated felt tinged with disappoint-
ment.
I didn't once walk inside a European
breakfast cafe or swanky Indian restau-
rant. I still don't know what Ethiopians
eat for dinner, and the fabled Chop House
remains a distant stranger - hell, I didn't
even get close enough to the restaurant to
peek in the windows.
But maybe that's the point. Maybe
there's a reason why students feel uncom-
fortable in unfamiliar and expensive
breakfast places, flock to the same Medi-
terranean places for falafel and opt for
cheap "Mexican" dinners instead of dish-
ing out a day's paycheck for a meal.
Eating out might be more about com-
fort of routine than broadening horizons
and palates, about playing it safe with old
favorites rather than taking chances on
the exotic and unknown. So unless my
parents are in town to treat me to din-
ner (in which case Main Street awaits), I
think I'll just stick with my usual Panera .-
salad and sushi rolls. I order the same
ones every time.

RESEARCH
From Page 4B
ducted less frequently and protests involve
animals instead of explosives, the federal
government's involvement in research con-
tinues.
Today, the National Institutes of Health
and the federal government support the
largest part of the University's $1.2 billion
research budget. Last year the NIH alone
gave the University more than $570 million
for health-related studies.
Forty-five percent of the research budget
goes to medicine-related studies, 15 percent
to engineering, 10 percent to public health
and 7 percent to social research.
Edie Goldenberg, a former LSA dean who
is now a public policy and political science
professor, saw the expansion of research not
only in biomedical but other fields as well,
while she served as dean from 1989-1998.
"During my time in LSA, Michigan
- became the (second) largest research Uni-
versity in terms of amount of funding, after
Johns Hopkins," Goldenberg said.
With increased funding and encourage-
ment of research, the work at the University
flourished. Other institutes were built and
soon garnered more national recognition.
The University's Institute for Social
Research is one of the leading centers for
survey research and houses five centers: the
Center for Political Studies, the Inter-uni-
versity Consortium for Political and Social
Research, the Research Center for Group
Dynamics, the Survey Research Center and
the Population Studies-Center.
ISR is not housed within a specific school,
but the Institute for the Humanities, the
University's humanities research center,

is in LSA. Goldenberg said the institute is
amongst the best of its kind.
"The social sciences here at Michigan are
very strong," Goldenberg said. "They are
really something to be proud of at Michigan
and they generate a lot of research activity,
perhaps more than most other social science
departments in other places."
The University prides itself on encourag-
ing interdisciplinary work between fields
and departments by housing strong core
areas for research, including medicine, engi-
neering, public health and social research,
Forrest said.
"All of these four schools are strongly cou-
pled to other schools around campus that are
much broader in scope and vision," Forrest
said. "We're so collaborative that it allows
us to look at multi-dimensions of the same
problem."
Ken Warner, dean of the School of Public
Health from 2005-2010, said that when he
was asked by Duderstadt to chair a commis-
sion to search for a new provost, the Univer-
sity's interdisciplinary work was something
many candidates said differentiated it from
other schools.
"I don't think you could find another uni-
versity that has as many schools and colleges
as we do that are ranked in the top 10 in their
fields," Warner said. "We have breadth and
we have depth."
Warner, who said he was attracted to
the University because of its reputation
for research, has developed classes he
said wouldn't be able to teach without his
research.
"One of the advantages of a university
like this for the students is that they are
really learning state-of-the-art knowledge
and methods," Warner said. "Most of the

faculty are very '" " * * 
active on their
scholarship and
their research.
It means they're
up to date, and
it means the stu -
dents are learn-
ing what's really
current."
Likewise,
first-hand
involvement
in research for
undergraduates
is something
the University
receives national
acclaim for now,
but it increased
tenfold while
Goldenberg was -
dean of LSA, she
said.
"There was a
tiny little pro-
gram called . a.. . . . .
UROP that had
14 students when I
became dean, and
now it's, I think, pushing 1,000," Goldenberg
said. "So that was a big ramping up of that
program."
University President Mary Sue Cole-
man, a biochemist by trade, openly supports
research growth. Coleman participated in
research as an undergraduate for a summer
and felt the experience was important.
"It was totally different from taking a
course," Coleman said. "I think it was one of
the reasons that I probably decided to go on

opposed to other universities around the
country.
"All the other proposals that were sub-
mitted to NSF would have built much less
capable networks," Van Houweling said.
"(Other university networks) would have
gotten saturated. There wouldn't have
been enough resources to make them
work, and the notion of these Internet pro-
tocols that we now depend on for every-
thing would have gotten a black eye.'It
might have been the end of the Internet."
Atkins said if the University did not step
up, the Internet could have ended up as a
much more closed environment that was
segmented between telecommunications
companies.
Echoing Atkins's words, Van Houwel-
ing said the telecommunications compa-
nies were against the open structure of the
Internet he helped create,
"Of course, none of the telephone com-
panies thought this was a good idea," Van
Houweling said. "From their point of view,
the only way to run a network was with a

The University has increased the diver-
sification of its funding by starting part-
nerships with industry and allowing
businesses to contribute funds, which less-
ens dependency on federal funds should
they diminish.
Last year, for instance, saw no increase
in federal funding.
Vice President for Research Stephen
Forrest said the lack of increase is to be
expected now as well as in the future.
"If we look over the next decade we're
going to see a slowing in the growth of
" federal funding."
Ultimately, what Duderstadt says
drives research at the University - soci-
ety's wants - is what Forrest calls the
" University's great asset.

Looking back on what his team achieved,
Van Houweling said he believes the Inter-
net could have been created only in an aca-
demic setting.
"The only place in the world the Inter-
net could have been invented was.at a uni-
versity, because we're the only people who
understand that good things happen when
nobody is in charge," he said.

"It made the case that research was so

versity campuses," Duderstadt said.
Though the federal government knew the
Â® import'ance of funding university research,
most of its awards were limited to military and
national security research. Only a small per-
centage of federal funds were granted to non-
military experiments.
The University was no exception to the

As the Cold War heated up, the federal gov-

dollars to conduct classified military research;

did not have its own central apparatus for
research and thus most of this classified
research was conducted through the Col-
lege of Engineering, according to Duder-
stadt.
Most of the classified research was con-
ducted at Willow Run Laboratories near
Ypsilanti, an off-campus facility that now
functions asanairport. Duderstadtsaid the
University chose an off-campus facility to
limit outside exposure as much as possible.
Only a small amount of classified research
was conducted on-campus, according to
Duderstadt.
But at the height of the Vietnam War in
the 1960s and 1970s, controversy began to
swirl around the University's involvement
in classified government research.
"As Vietnam became a controversial
issue, students were very concerned about
the military industrial complex," Duder-
stadt said. "They were concerned about
being drafted, and so this became a hot
issue."
In the early 1970s, the uproar over clas-
sified research being done at the University
grew so violent that Willow Run's on-cam-

taking lives, then the policy was against
* it," Duderstadt said.
Even after the University made these
reforms and cut its ties to military
research, student protests continued
well into the early 1980s. Duderstadt said
* on a few occasions students even tried to
: break in and take over laboratories on
* campus.
* Duderstadt said he still agrees with
the University's policy to restrict classi-
fied military research on campus. How-
ever, he conceded that since most of the +
country's mathematical and scientific
talent is concentrated within universi-
ties, academia must be involved with
some of America's clandestine activities,
albeit in off-campus locations.
Duderstadt cited cryptography, the prac-
tice of code breaking for the intelligence com-
munity, as an example.
"(University Provost) Phil Hanlon is a
world-class cryptographer, but he doesn't do
it on campus," Duderstadt said. "He goes to
California in the summer.,
Duderstadt stressed that without the
involvement of the University's research
institutions, national security would be very
much at risk in this country.
Research today
As the University severed ties with military
research, it moved into a new field that con-
tinues to dominate research today: biomedical
research.
This transition was triggered by a broader
societal need for such research, Duderstadt
said.
"No matter what the federal government
tells you, the priorities for research are really
driven very much by larger trends in our soci-
ety," Duderstadt said, adding that in the 1970s
and 1980s the national focus switched from
defense technologies to health care.

Starting in 1987, Van Houweling spear-
headed the University's effort to rebuild
NSFNET. His team initially approached
the state of Michigan's own network
Merit, which was created collaboratively
by the University of Michigan, Michigan
State University and Wayne State Uni-
versity, to work together on the project.
After the Merit board agreed to join
the project, Van Hou-
weling solicited the
help of IBM and MCI,
a now-defunct tele-
communications
company, to build the
hardware and routers
for the network. The
partnership between
the private and pub-
lic sectors made Van .

In the end, NSF
awarded the Univer-
sity funding to launch
the new NSFNET in
" 1988 because of the
strength of its proposal
and its low costs, Van
Houweling said.
Van Houweling
said it was from this
point forward that the
Internet as we know
it today began to take
shape. The new NSF-
NET, unlike its prede-
cessor, did not become
oversaturated with information and .
actually grew by 10 percent every month
until it was shut off in 1995.
Initially, the network was restricted to
research facilities and higher education.
But as it grew, many commercial compa-
nies started to pay for its connections and
access spread to the general population.
By the time the University shut off NSF-
NET in 1995, private corporations had the
knowledge to run their own networks.
Van Houweling added that the Univer-
sity was uniquely positioned to build a
