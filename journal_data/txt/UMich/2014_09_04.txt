School of Social

to discuss Michael

By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
After weeks of nationwide
coverage of the turmoil in Fer-
guson, Mo. over the controver-
sial shooting of Michael Brown,
the University's Community
Organization Learning Com-
munity along with the Commu-

nity Action and Social Change
minor program hosted about 90
students and faculty Wednes-
day to discuss race relations in
light of the protests..
Students gathered for the
interactive forum and were
given the chance to exchange
thoughts, concerns and discuss
possible ways forward from
Brown's death.
Brown, a Black teenager, was
shot and killed by Ferguson
police officer Darren Wilson,
who is white, on Aug. 9. The
details of the incident are still
under investigation. However,
Brown was unarmed, alleg-

edly, and in response Ferguson
residents took to the streets to
protest violent police practices
Black citizens.
Protests continued after a
portion of the demonstrators

Ferguson police employed riot
gear and armored vehicles to
contain the protests. The situ-
ation has sparked national dis-
cussion on the use of excessive
force by police officers and sys-
temic prejudice against young
Black men.
Wednesday's forum began
with faculty members shar-
ing their reactions to the inci-

dent. Among the speakers was
Desmond Patton, an assistant
professor of social work and
assistant professor of informa-
tion, who discussed his recent
visit to Ferguson. While he
did witness the protests in the
street, he also saw the other
areas of the neighborhood liv-
ing peacefully, offering him
a unique perspective on the
town.
"What I saw was not what
you all see on the news," Patton
said. "After I came back I knew

As University President Mark
Schlissel heads into his first year,
he may not be the only new face in
the administration for long.
Two executive committees,
one formed in May and one in
August, are currently searching
for replacements for Ora Pesco-
vitz, former executive vice presi-
dent for medical affairs and CEO
of the University of Michigan
Health System, and Timothy Slot-
tow, former University executive
vice president and chief financial
officer. Both announced earlier
this year that they would be step-
ping down.
There are 13 executive officers
in total at the University. Of those,
10 hold permanent positions. The

remaining three are interim CFO
Douglas Strong, interim EVPMA
Dr. Michael Johns and 'S. Jack
Hu, interim vice president for
research.
The EVPMA search committee,
formed in May, is further along in
the search process than the CFO
committee. Dr. Paul Lee, direc-
tor of the Kellogg Eye Center and
chair of the EVPMA committee,
said the search has been going
well thus far, and he's been pleased
with its progress.
Over the past few months the
EVPMA committee has hosted
public forums with groups such
as UMHS faculty and staff, and
has met with other groups across
the University that are impacted
by the position. Lee said the com-
mittee is now finished with that
phase, though it is still accepting
feedback and nominations.
"It was wonderful to hear the
degree of focus from all the people
who participated on what's good
for the University of Michigan as
an organization, what's good for

F CAMPUS LIFE
'Take back the
RC' reaches
an agreement

Mural painting
to continue with
approval from arts
coordinator
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Last semester, a small group
of students in the Residen-
tial College, one of East Quad
Residence Hall's learning com-
munities, wrote a quote on the
white wall of the building's
basement. When maintenance
staff painted over the "mural,"
a movement started: "Take
Back the RC" - an effort to
assert student ownership of the
learning community.
The movement was strong,
enough to elicit a response
from the RC's administration,
members of which met with
students in mid-April to discuss
solutions to the problem.
Now, that solution has
arrived in the form of a four-
page document titled "Art in
East Quad: Policies and Pro-
cedures." Drafted during the

summer, the guide requires any
resident of East Quad - not just
the RC - to propose public art
projects to a new arts coordina-
tor, who will help to evaluate
available space and potential
maintenance concerns before
approving potential works.
The document encourages
students to consult with the
coordinator early during the
fall semester, though additional
requests may be accepted on a
rolling basis.
The criteria for artwork will
include "contribution to the
educational purposes of the
University," in addition to its
"aesthetic quality" and "rela-
tive uniqueness," among other
factors.
RC Acting Director Charles
Bright, who worked with Uni-
versity Housing to draft the
new policy, said it is the best
of both worlds - combining
the priorities of dorm residents
with projects potentially gener-
ated through art classes housed
in East Quad.
"Truth be told, people need
to own the spaces they live in,"
Bright said. "They need to feel

Due to an unfortunate over-
sight, the Ann Arbor Down-
town Development Authority
lost a night out for drinks.
The DDA canceled a sched-
uled meeting Wednesday night
after two Michigan Daily
reporters were denied entry to
the scheduled venue. The city's
official online calendar listed
a DDA meeting for Wednesday
as a "DDA Chair's Gathering"
at Bill's Beer Garden oh Ashley
Street. However, the restaurant
only allows customers of legal
drinking age, unless a parent
accompanies them.
DDA Executive Director
Susan Pollay said the gathering
was only intended to be a social
event. They decided to post the
meeting online in case there
was a full quorum and she said
it was not intended to include

DEFENSE CLASS

The good, the bad and the UgLi

Our new rotating item, 'Student
Profiles,' will chronicle the
experience of students on
campus this fall.
LSA. freshman Mac Levin's
first week at the University
was pretty standard. He met
new friends and went to some
"fun parties." His only regret:
"Having to go back to school
and hit the books."
Levin has liked his sports
sociology course so far - he
was particularly enthused
when he discovered that
De'Veon Smith, a running back
for the Michigan football team,
was in his class."
Regardless, after all of the
excitement of Welcome Week
came to an end, and as much as
Levin wasn't excited to "hit the

books," it seems that they were
pretty excited to hit back.
While studying insthe Sha-
piro Undergraduate Library
Wednesday afternoon, Levin
had just introduced himself
to two girls and began to lean
back in his chair. He leaned too
far.
"I went right into a metal
book case," he reminisced with
a laugh. "It kind of hurt, but
I'm alright. It made a big noise.
Everyone in the library turned
toward me. Probably one of the
most embarrassing moments
of my life."
While embarrassing, the
incident doesn't seem to
have fazed Levin. In fact, he
couldn't chair less.

work for the DDA.
"It was just supposed to be a
beer," she said.
Pollay said the gathering was
organized by DDA member John
Mouat. Because the restaurant
allows children accompanied by
parents, Pollay said the group
didn't realize there was a policy
restricting minors and that it
"wasn't on their radar." No one
requested a special arrange-
ment to allow the full public into
the restaurant. Had the meeting
taken place, a significant portion
of the University student body
would not have been allowed
inside.
Two Daily reporters arrived
at Bill's Beer Garden but were
asked to leave because they were
younger than 21.
Staff members at the restau-
rant suggested at one point that
they would let the Daily report-
RC

that those spaces are theirs."
"To own the space is to be able
to put something on the wall, but
the wall itself is shared. It has tobe
somehow negotiated through."
LSA junior Kerry Fingerle, a
student in the RC and one of the
leaders of the "Take Back the RC"
movement, said the policy is prom-
ising, but only time will tell wheth-
er or not it is effective.
"I think it's great that they're
talking about how to get student
work onto the walls," Fingerle
said. "It's a little premature to even

ers in, but said it would be too
difficult to allow unaccompa-
nied, underage patrons to attend
the meeting since it would be too
hard to remove them afterward.
Pollay said she then contacted
other DDA members, and at about
5:30 p.m. the meeting was can-
celed to avoid "disenfranchise-
ment" of the Daily.
It is unclear exactly why the
members felt they needed to list
the gathering as a public meeting
on the city's website when it was
only intended as a social event
without any DDA work. How-
ever, the Michigan Constitution's
Open Meetings Act requires all
meetings that meet a quorum of
members to be open to the public.
The DDA is one of the most
active and important committees
in the city, working to promote
economic growth and activity in
downtown Ann Arbor. In recent
years, the DDA has taken criti-
cism for having too much influ-
ence over the City Council's
priorities, overshadowing the
needs of other neighborhoods.
speculate on it because there hasn't
been amural submitted yet. Just
because something was written on
paper ... how it plays out could be
pretty different."
LSA junior Amanda Nelson, also
an RC student and "Take Back the
RC" leader, stressed that better
communication will be essential
to increasing student awareness
of the new policy and encouraging
submissions.
"I think this was posted once
on a Facebook page," Nelson said.
"And I don't believe it's been made
easily accessible to students, espe-
cially Residential College fresh-
men. And I think that's an integral
part ... to let students know the
opportunities that they have."

VOTING
From Page 1A
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Taylor said much of his
time until the general election takes
place will be business as usual, and he
will continue to campaign and make
preparations to become Ann Arbor's
next mayor."
"I will continue to serve as a mem-
ber of City Council," Taylor said. "I
will of course look to make plans for
the general election - there is a gen-
eral election, we do need to honor the
process, and if I am so fortunate as to
win in November, I look forward to
serving as mayor."
Kelly said his main concernleading
up to the general election has been
gaining a better understandingof the
key issues the city currently faces and
what influence the city has on devel-
opment. He also plans to discuss the
kind of future Ann Arbor residents
hope the city will have.
"(I am) trying to basically perform
a very transparent investigation into
what it's like to run for mayor and
how the city is run and what kind of
city we're going to become," Kelly
said. "I feelike there might be a lot of
misinterpretation about what I'm try-
ing to do here in one form or another,
and I think primarily what I want to
be is someone who is worth voting
for."

Though victorious candidates in
Ann Arbor's recent history have been
affiliated with either the Republican
or Democratic party, many of Ann
Arbor's mayors have run against
independent candidates, such as
Dominick A. DeVarti, an independent
candidate in the 1950s and founder
of the downtown restaurant Domi-
nick's.
The Ann Arbor Chronicle's polling
prior to the Democratic primary, as
obtained from Public Policy Polling,
found that among likely Democratic
primary voters, 52 percent approved
of current Mayor John Hieftje's per-
formance. Kelly said he hopes to
reach out to those identifying not
with the Democratic Party, but rather
with his stances on individual issues.
Taylor won the primary on a platform
emphasizing a continuation of the
current political climate and direc-
tion of the city as led by Hieftje.
"I think Mayor Hieftje and the
council have done a wonderful job of
cultivating a vibrant downtown, but
sooner or later an effort needs to be
made to let that energy spill out of the
downtown footprint," Kelly wrote in
an e-mail. "A person who votes for
me shares my vision of a future Ann
Arbor where neighborhoods have
more proximate culture, where the
total emphasis of job creation is taken
off downtown and spread across the
range of neighborhoods."
The general election will be held
on Nov. 4.

us for their health and health
care," Lee said. "One of the
great things about Michigan is
how we all work together to do
the very best."
The EVPMA position comes
with several key require-
ments, including a medical or
equivalent degree, clinical and
academic experience, broad
knowledge of health policy
issues and experience and
knowledge in managing an enti-
ty as large as UMHS. The health
system includes the University
hospitals, practices, specialty
centers and the Medical School,
and comes with a $3.4 billion
annual operating budget.
When asked what he's look-
ing for in a potential EVPMA
in a July press release, Schlissel
reiterated several of the bench-
marks in the position descrip-
tion, including experience in
academia and medicine, and
with management and business.

He also said he would look
for someone who has a "real
sensitivity to what faculty and
students need to be success-
ful."
The committee hopes to have
someone in the position by early
2015. However, Lee said the tar-
get time period wasn't neces-
sarily exact.
"The goal is to find the best
possible person, and so we don't
want to rush through things,"
he said.
The CFO search commit-
tee is at a much earlier stage
in the search process, and nei-
ther benchmarks nor a position
description have been released
yet.
In the same July interview,
Schlissel said he thought the
position could go to someone
with or without university
experience.
"Business and management
acumen will be critical, along
with an ability to explain chal-
lenges and opportunities to
constituencies," he said. "It's
essential that we find someone
who can work collaboratively

and has a passion for higher
education."
The CFO's responsibilities
include overseeingfacilities and
operations, finance,information
and technology services, invest-
ments and human resources.
For both positions, Schlissel
will make the final decision on
whom to put forward for the
approval of the University's
Board of Regents. He will do so
in consultation with the search
committees after they make
their recommendations of final-
ists. A liaison to the President's
Office, project manager Lisa
Connolly, who is a senior man-
ager for executive searchers.
Lee characterized Schlis-
sel's involvement in the EVPMA
search process thus far as
"respectful."
"President Schlissel met with
the committee to give us our
charge as a committee, and we
were very appreciative of that,"
Lee said. "And then he's been
very respectful of the commit-
tee in terms of doing the work to
help identify the most appropri-
ate, best fit for us."

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the president's
liaison onthe committee serves
primarilyina support role dur-
ing this part of the process in
order to facilitate communi-
cation between the commit-
tee, the executive search firms
hired to aid the search, and
the president's office, as well
as assist with campus outreach
efforts.
"Obviously, (Schlissel) makes
the final decision (on the nomi-
nation)," Fitzgerald said. "Dur-
ing the search process, it's not
something he's deeply involved
in, and that's why Lisa Con-
nolly, as the representative of
the president's office, is more in
touch on an ongoing basis with
the search consultants and the
search committee."
More information about
the CFO search, including the
position description, should be
released soon, Fitzgerald said.
He also the CFO search com-
mittee plans to begin campus
outreach events shortly, though
the form those will take is yet to
be determined.

need to be talking about this
incident. I hope that we think
deeply about the experience of
Black people, of Black men and
that Black lives do matter." ,
Social Work student Loren
Cahill, a resident of St. Louis,
also shared her experience as
one of the first protesters in Fer-
guson after the incident.
"We began with a group of
only 20 people," Cahill said.
"This effort that began as a
small but dedicated crowd has
become a larger mobilization
effort that has touched the
hearts of thousands."

After the speakers finished,
the audience broke into small
groups. They were asked to dis-
cuss their initial reactions, as
well as consider changes that
could be made to improve race
relations in the future. -
Many students discussed
how the race-fueled turmoil in
Ferguson resonates nationwide.
"This is an event that could
happen anywhere," said Social
Work student Sarah Emeritz.
"It goes along with the idea that
a threat to justice anywhere is
a threat to justice everywhere.
While it may be something
going on in a different part of
the U.S., or in another country,
it's something that affects peo-
ple and the way we interact with
each other."

Some students thought that
police reform and demilitar-
ization would help minimize
extreme reactions in the future.
"I don't want violence to be
the first response," said Social
Work student Bobby Raham.
"We have to have a real conver-
sation about how police should
behave with their constituents.
They need to understand the
community and culture they
work with."
"There was an unaccept-
able and excessive force by the
police, and they should be held
accountable for this," Cahill
said.
Students also discussed their
feelings that police violence
against Black men has become
the norm.

"I was upset because I wasn't
surprised," said Social Work
student Chloe Jean. "They've
really taken the shock out of it.
We're fighting for human rights
all over the world when we can't
even give human rights to our
citizens in America."
Overall, the audience shared
a dedication to fixing the per-
sistent issue of racial injustice
but lamented that they feel 4
little has been accomplished
despite the hard work that has
been done.
One student could be over-
heard reflecting on a similar
forum she attended for the
Trayvon Martin case last year.
Another student replied, "No
one would be surprised if we're
here again next year."

Welcome back to Michigan in
Color, a space for People of Color
(PoCs) on the University of Michigan
campus to facilitate change by
sharing their stories and voices.
Michigan in Color (MiC) was
launched on Martin Luther King,
Jr. Day, Jan. 20, 2014, by three
women of color - Rima Fadlallah,
Jerusaliem Gebreziabher and Kayla
Upadhayaya, with two initial goals:
to help individuals and groups see
beyond their own experiences, and
to feel and embrace power from
other communities of color across
the University of Michigan campus.
Since its inception, MiC has had
a powerful, widespread impact.
People who had never picked up
The Michigan Daily before were
reading it consistently. Professors
were selecting MiC pieces to initiate
discussions in class. MiC writers
started receiving responses from
readers from across the country and
the world that reflected on their own
issues as PoCs. For the past nine
months, MiC has radically raised
discussions and awareness about
issues that are important to PoCs.
People listened. They still are.
But MiC isn't just about getting
people to take notice; we address an
unmetneed.Aneedfor allstudents to
be valued, affirmed and heard. With
every publication, MiC proves that
even though our stories as people
of color deviate from mainstream
narratives, our stories are worthy of
words, ink, time and space. In fact,
our stories are oftentimes made
valuable because they stray from the
dominantnorm.
MiC is a crucial space on this
campus - a space for PoCs to
celebrate what is rarely celebrated
and to take comfort in what we often
feel pressure to defend. It is a space
where PoCs do not have to strip or
censor our stories of the ache, shame,
or pain we carry before sharing them
with the world. Our contributors
aren't required to dissect their
narratives into "logical" bite-sized
pieces to prepare them for public
consumption. As The Michigan
Daily's first section where the
creators, editors, and publishers are
exclusively People of Color, we aren't
here to be politically correct. This is
our truth, and these are our stories.
MiC is not here to be shiny, or
fierce, or revolutionary. It is here
to tell honest stories that shovel
beneath the heart. And by doing so,
Michigan in Color has allowed us to
jump through windows of curiosity,
rage, wonder. It becomes fierce and
revolutionary because it is honest
storytelling; it is honest listening
that pushes, challenges, questions,
affirms - and that combination
unlatches all the windows.
MiC offers storytelling that does
not claim to be anything other than
narratives from the mouth, the
brain, the heart. For us, the best
part about storytelling is that while

you will never have the exact same
experience as someone else, you
have the power to weave together
something from your own world that
connects and supports and builds
upon your own experience. We hope
MiC will foster a space of connection
for our readers, as well as a place of
empathy, listening and generosity.
Last year MiC defined itself and
carved its space on campus. This year,
we will take a new step. Stories can be
told with words - but they can also
be told with art, music, pictures, and
so many more mediums. We want to
create new multimedia avenues for
our voices to speak and to be heard.
Throughout the year, we will be
introducing new visual and artistic
elements to Michigan in Color with
platforms for cartoons, illustrations,
poetry and song. We want MiC to
be more than a newspaper column;
we want it to become a dynamic
community - a support network for
communities of color on campus,
one that provides opportunities for
individual and collective growth
through the sharing of our stories,
one that pushes us beyond the space
to listen, challenge, empathize and
grow.
We want all our readers to see
that there is no one way to be any
color, any ethnicity, any identity.
MiC is a space for stories to be told.
We do not speak for all - we speak
for ourselves, and these narratives
have a right to be heard. Let us tell
them proudly.
We are the new Michigan in Color
editors, and these are our stories:
I'm Carlina Duan, and I'm here
because I want to help build an
accessible, powerful space on cam-
pus that uses narrative to pummel
past doors. As a first-generation
Chinese American, I'm often stuck
switching between codes of "Ameri-
can" versus "Chinese," navigating
feelings of strangeness and small-
ness, while simultaneously hatching
wonder and joy. For me, my identity
as a Chinese American woman is as
stunning as it is confusing. As a stu-
dent on this campus, I want to talk
about the confusion. I want to talk
about what gets skimmed over or
pressed into flatter shapes. For me,
Michigan in Color is urgent. It has
the ability to amplify honest conver-
sations surrounding issues of race,
ethnicity, and personhood. It has
the power to dimensionalize and
heal, teaching us all how to stretch
- and, ultimately, how to grow.
I'm Ryan Moody, and I'm here
because I am tired of me and my
friendsbeingsilenced and dismissed
as oversensitive. For me, the desire
to be understood, disprove negative
stereotypes, and avoid offending
others prevents my speaking can-
didly outside of the few spaces creat-
ed by and for people of color. Instead,
I am often telling a white-washed
version of my truths. Though each
person has unique life experiences, I

think that we, as PoCs, are all linked
by common pressures that restrict
the ways in which we express our-
selves. Michigan in Color is working
to repair that dynamic. I'm excited
to help build and maintain one of
the few spaces on campus where
I have seen people of color be and
thrive unfiltered.
I'm Teresa Mathew, and I'm here
because I want all people of all colors
and heritages to know that they
deserve to forge their own identities
and tell their own stories. I'm tired
of people thinking that because they
can look at me and classify me as
Indian they can ascribe everything
they think that identity means (a love
of Bollywood, elaborate weddings,
Hinduism) to me. Guys, literally
none ofthose things are true. For me,
Michigan in Color is a furnace. We
will ignite fires and blaze our truth,
bringing light and warmth to those
who have been left out in the dark.
I'm Nour Soubani, and I'm here
because I've learned that not telling
our own stories erases us. As a Pales-
tinianAmericanmyidentity wasone
that people, didn't even recognize -
"Palestine? What's that?" - and so it
becamesomethingIfeltIhadtohide,
something I couldn't even under-
stand for myself, let alone explain to
someone else. Only when I was sur-
rounded by people who wanted to
talk about and listen to Palestinians
did I have a chance to truly embrace
who I was and where I came from,
and that has given me awell of inspi-
ration and courage on which I draw
often. For me, MiC is necessary; it is
critical for our survival. I'm a MiC
editor because I believe in the trans-
formative power our stories have to
heal us and those who listen to us.
We need to talk about who we are
and what our identities mean, to find
strength and passion in our strug-
gles and resistance and bravery. By
speaking our truths uninterrupted
and unapologetically, we can come
to know ourselves, our sorrows and
sadness, our triumphs and our pain
- and love and appreciate all of it.
So for all of you PoCs who see this
as something you want to be a part
of, now is your time. This can be your
space, ifyou wantto make itso. If you

Read

o this, actually. This isn't
important. Doubtless there are
other things - chemistry textbooks,
news stories, 18th-century English novels,
brilliant yet ridiculously
dense academic works that
make your eyes glaze over
- you should be reading
right now. For time's sake,
just skip the rest of this
column and go read them.
Why? Sometimes the
syllabus says so and that's ERIC
justification enough; after FERGUSON
all, you will miss some
things in college if you
don't get into the habit of doing the readings.
At the very least, you'll actually know what's
coming out of your fingertips while working
on a term paper 24 hours before the deadline,
frantically pumping out text to meet the page
requirement. If you just can't take the time to
read because you're busy volunteering for a
nonprofit in Detroit or agitating in the Diag
on your social justice issue du jour, fine -
you're probably reading up on and learning
about those things, and that's good enough
for me.
Well, almost good enough. If you're
passionate about any issue at all, chances
are you want to do something about it. And
fortunately for you, it's election season once
more. You should participate, but recognize
at the same time that there will be issues at
stake you know little about. There is nothing
wrong with that - to some extent, each and
every person is a mountain of ignorance -
but for the sake of your future and that of
everyone around you, don't just go vote on
Election Day without seeking out information
on the issues beforehand. Being informed is a
responsibility you can't afford to ignore.
Who you choose to represent you and the
decisions you make to favor or oppose state
Supreme Court candidates or ballot measures
(Prop 1, Prop 2, et cetera) will affect the
lives of others. Any political scientist would

tell you the act of one more random person
casting their vote matters little due to the
statistical improbability of that vote deciding
the election. However, the consequences of
failing to "do the reading" on the issues on
which you vote - and even ones not on the
ballot - are damning in the long run, while
the benefits of doing the reading are great.
If you want to win others over to your
side or even just increase their awareness of
your cause, being knowledgeable is key. The
knowledge you bring to the table multiplies
when you use it to raise others' awareness.
Even better, knowledge is invaluable if you're
called upon to make a decision like the ones
every voting-age American is called upon to
make on Election Day. Besides, you'll be far
more likely to impress those around you with
what you know, and far less likely to make an
idiot out of yourself in conversation. Getting
into the habit of being informed now, as a stu-
dent, is therefore both personally beneficial
and unquestionably a good thing to do.
So read for the classes in your major. Read,
at least a little bit, for the classes you're
required to take. What you learn there might
even come in handy someday. Read up on
issues on which you have a strong opinion
- and for the love of God, don't just read the
latest ThinkProgress or Fox News article on
the issue and call yourself informed. Read the
best arguments you can find that go against
your strong opinions, and remind yourself
that some people's views justifiably differ
from yours. Read comments on the Internet
every so often, if only to remind yourself
how many people have no idea what they are
talking about. You are entitled to your own
opinion on any issue, but if you're going to
even think about affecting someone else's life
by expressing that opinion through voting or
advocacy, read. Read like the quality of your
life and the lives of everyone you know and
love depend on it - simply because they do.

Unaddressed for too long

Articles describing the horrific
tragedy that occurred at Isla Vista,
California on May 23rd appeared on
newsfeeds across the nation while
the stream of hashtags feverishly
trended across Twitter.
While I fully supported the
emboldened outcry of my fellow
feminists, I hesitated before open-
ing each journalistic piece offering
coverage of the incident. Before
each click of the mouse, I wondered:
"Now, what is this article going to
say about the shooter?" Therein lies
a flaw of our news media. While
piece after piece sensationalizes
the event, the media has yet to delve
into the overreaching problems that
led up to this rampage. The name of
the perpetrator is plastered across
cyberspace, but more of a focus
should be placed on raising aware-
ness of the dangers objectification
and misogyny pose to our society.
Now, I don't mean to insinuate
news outlets are being neglect-
ful in their coverage. Rather, I'm
extremely troubled by the amount
of the news hole occupied by a sin-
gle individual. Why are news outlets
continuing to only give attention
to a man who was seeking infamy

when he committed these acts? The
motivations behind the rampage
are complex and no single issue -
whether it be mental illness, misog-
yny or objectification - is the sole
driving force behind the incident.
However, I'm bothered by the
manner in which some articles fail to
acknowledge how the tragedy at Isla
Vista illustrates a glaring epidemic
still running rampant in this
patriarchal society of ours. While
this recent incident demonstrates
the dangers of misogyny to an
extreme degree, society needs to
learn objectification and misogyny
are harmful to women on every
level. Likewise, these problems
are far too prevalent and sadly go
unaddressed in our society.
Objectification is the reduction of
a human being until they are treated
merely as an object. These young
women and men were more than
just the "beautiful blonde girls in
revealing shorts" or the "obnoxious
brutes" described in those chilling
and vengeful YouTube videos.
Yes, the man responsible for
their deaths was deeply troubled
and a vehement misogynist who
erroneously believed women owed

him whatever he desired. However,
he's a single case out of many. The
stereotypes and images polluting
our society allow individuals to
believe reducing a human's worth
to nothing more than good hair or
their physique is acceptable. When
women and a number of men are
viewed merely as objects, it's far
too easy for others to treat them
as such. Misogyny develops as a
result. These flawed beliefs lead to
the unbelievably large amount of
violence and harassment women
face on a daily basis, and they help
to explain why the United States
possesses one of the highest rates of
rape in the world.
Misogyny, objectification,
harassment and violence against
women aren't merely the ranting
of angry feminists. They're
widespread problems with dire
consequences. While these issues
shouldn't detract from the coverage
of recent events, these actions
indicate these issues have gone
unaddressed for far too long and
need to be brought to light.

FOOTBALL
Michigan preps
for ND's Golson

Hoke:'Not talking' about injuries
OL Kyle Bosch a qP

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
They say Everett Golson is
good enough to start on the Notre
Dame basketball team.
They call him a playmaker.
"Electric." The player you have to
look after because of his speed.
Now, they say he's a complete
quarterback.
Even after being suspended
a year for what he called "poor
academic judgment," Golson
returns this season with the
same speed that exposed
defenses last season and a strong
arm that will test the Michigan
football team's secondary.
"To me, watching him on
tape, he has a really strong arm,"
said defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison on Monday. "He has
thrown so many deep passes this
last game, more than he usually
would, that were on the money. I
see aguy who's not only mobile but
also has a really, really strong arm.
He's becoming a really complete
quarterbackinmymind." -
Added junior linebacker Joe
Bolden: "He's the stereotype of a
dual-threat quarterback."
In the 16th-ranked Fighting
Irish's 48-17 win over Rice, Golson
went 14-for-22 for 295 yards and
two touchdowns passing while
running for three touchdowns.
But his skill set isn't unique,
nor is it new to Michigan. Ohio
State quarterback Braxton Miller
has burned the Wolverines
before, and former quarterback
Denard Robinson has torched
many a team.
Even current quarterback, fifth-
year senior Devin Gardner, has the
mobility to escape defenses.
But in the past, Hoke and
company have used former
wide receiver Joe Reynolds to

simulate mobile quarterbacks.
With his departure, Michigan is
using backup quarterbacks Brian
Clearyand Wilton Speight.
"Those two have given us good
looks," Hoke said. "Because of
the first opponent, we've worked
really hard on the zone-read
aspect. So, you're gonna play, a
really good athlete. We gotta have
11 guys to the football."
Against Appalachian State,
the defense lined up in the 3-4,
putting senior defensive end
Frank Clark as a linebacker,
giving more options in the event
Golson scrambles.
The Wolverines succeeded
in getting into the backfield
with the formation, but failed
to force a turnover against the
Mountaineers.
"You gotta cover the guy you're
supposed to cover as well as keep
your eyes on the quarterback to
make sure he doesn't take off on
you," Bolden said. "He's fast, he's
athletic and he's a playmaker."
It's Golson's arm that poses
the biggest threat, and he toyed
with Rice by scrambling and then
unleashingadeepbombdownfield
or findinganopenreceiver.
"Our receivers clearly 'know
that there is no area on the field
that Everett can't get to (with his
arm)," said Notre Dame coach
Brian Kelly after the game.
"He kept his eyes downfield,
knew when to run, knew when
to throw it, and those are things
we really talked about. We didn't
want to overcoach him in that
we were going to allow him to
get outside the pocket and be a
football player and just naturally
go play the game. He came back
and I think really showed the kind
of player that he can be."
Added Bolden: "He's been off
for a year, so he's ready to play."

of absence for
personal reasons
By GREG GARNO
ManagingSportsEditor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
generally refrains from talking
about injuries.
He called them "boo-boos"
in his first NOTEBOOK
years and
Wednesday, he
took it to anewlevel, refusing to
even acknowledge them.
When asked about the
status of senior linebacker
Desmond Morgan, who is now
in a rotation for his position
after starting last season, Hoke
didn't discuss it.
One reporter asked: "Will
Desmond Morgan play on
Saturday?"
To which Hoke replied:
"Well, you know, we're not
goingto talk about any injuries,"
he responded.
"So he's injured?" the
reporter responded.
"I didn't say that, you did,"
Hoke answered back.
Morgan finished with six
total tackles (four solo, two
assisted) against Appalachian
State, but Hoke's response
raised more questions than it
answered.
He was consistent with his
non-answer when asked about
freshman Jabrill Peppers status
for Saturday, two days after he
said the cornerback would be
good to go.
"We're not talking about
injuries," Hoke said.
And when asked about the
progression of sophomore tight
end Jake Butt, Hoke went back
to his go-to phrase. Butt is
recovering from an ACL injury
in March and is slated to return

PAUL sHERMAN/Daily
Brady Hoke declined to comment on injuries but announced that Kyle Bosch would take a leave of absence indefinitely.

in time for the Big Ten season.
That time, he was in a joking
mood.
"Good job, though," he told
the reporter.
BOSCH LEAVES: Michigan
announced that sophomore
offensive lineman Kyle Bosch
has taken a leave of absence
indefinitely from the program.
"Kyle Bosch has taken a leave
of absence for an undetermined
amount of time for personal
reasons," Hoke said in a
statement. "We ask that his
privacy be respected at this
time. We wish him the best and
look forward to his return."
Bosch was one of several
linemen competing for
a starting position on an
inexperienced offensive line.
His lone start came last season
against Michigan State, when
the Wolverines rushed for
minus-48 yards.
He played in five games last
season and saw time as a backup

guard in the Wolverines' win
over Appalachian State on
Saturday.
Bosch was competing at
both guard spots, but was
listed behind sophomore
Erik Magnuson at left guard
and fifth-year senior Joey
Burzynski at right guard.
Sophomore Kyle Kalif would
move into second on the depth
chart automatically.
BOLDEN'S BEST BUD:
Junior linebacker Joe Bolden
was born and raised in the
Midwest, and he was born and
raised with the Notre Dame-
Michigan rivalry.
From Cincinnati, Ohio,
Bolden said he grew up
watching the game on TV and
was aware of the matchup well
before he was ever recruited.
Growing up the son of a high
school football coach, Bolden
said he went to his first game
when he was two weeks old and
then sat with his dad in front of

the TV on Saturday.
"Obviously, Notre Dame
comes on and Michigan comes
on at the same 'time, you're
going to watch them play,"
Bolden said. "It's a phenomenal
series."
But this matchup might mean
even more, since he played
in high school beside Notre
Dame linebacker Jarrett Grace.
Currently recovering from
injury, Grace likely won't be in
action, but that doesn't mean
the two aren't taking the rivalry
any less seriously.
"We love each other, but this
week we don't necessarily talk
to each until after the game,"
Bolden said. "We love each
other so much that we're not
going to be hard about things."
Bolden visited him in South
Bend, Ind. over the summer, one
of the few times he's traveled to
see his friend at school.
"It's almost like he's a brother
to me," Bolden said.

Wolverines hone
skills at home
for tournaments
during summer
By MATTHEW KIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
When classes ended for the
summer in April, the Michigan
women's golfers got to work on
their individual games.
Some golfers chose to
focus on developing their
techniques by not playing as
many tournaments. Others
participated heavily in
tournaments, choosing to work
on their complete game.
Without mandatory practice
times or study times, each
player could set her own
practice times and tournament
schedule.
"I think it is nice for them

Michigan coach Jan Dowling.
"They have a lot more freedom

Dowling was able to work
with the three returning

with the golfers, followed
their tournament results and
checked in on their wellbeing.

In rare chance to start,
Warner makes impact

Thursday, September 4, 2014 - 5A
Freshmen live up to billing

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer


Even early in her recruiting
process, Carly Warner's
on-court focus grabbed the
attention of Michigan volleyball
coach Mark Rosen.
Now a junior, Warner has
held Rosen's eye throughout
her career as a Wolverine.
There's only been one problem
- she shares a position with
the team's impact player, senior
setter Lexi Dannemiller, a
three-year starter.
But when Dannemiller
missed the team's season-
opening tournament last
weekend due to "internal
rules," Warner was thrust into
the spotlight and showed her
opponents what her coach
has known for years - even
without their senior captain,
the Wolverines have a leader in
their setter.
"She's someone who makes
other people better," . Rosen.
said. "And as a setter that's a
huge trait. ... Hitters love to hit
off her sets because she makes
them feel really good. Part of the
psychology of setting is being
that kind of teammate and she's
verygood atit.
"When it's game time, she
does a pretty good job of keeping
her emotions and any kind of
stressors out of the picture. She

stays calm and runs her team
really well."
Unwanted thoughts can
derail even the best athletes,
but Warner says blocking them
out has always come naturally
for her.
Even though she had a
month to prepare to start in
Dannemiller's place for the
Arkansas Invitational over
the weekend, she must have
used that gift to combat some
pregame nerves before the
Wolverines' opener against
Stephen F. Austin. While her
mind could have been any
number of places, Warner was
able to use a team mantra to
focus in.
"One quote that we've talked
about this year is, 'Be where
your feet are,' "Warner said.
"I always try to
compartmentalize what I'm
doing at the time."
Her feet may be on the court
even more the next three weeks.
Dannemiller could miss up to
a month with mononucleosis,
according to Warner, creating
more time on the floor for
Warner and redshirt freshman
Cindy Zhou.
And if Warner can produce
the way' she did in Arkansas,
it could be hard for Rosen to
sit her down much during that
stretch.
In three games over the

weekend, Warner tallied 126
assists, and of the Wolverines'
12.25 kills per set, she assisted
10.5 of them and committed
only one error on 17 total attack
attempts.
"I thought that she certainly
played at a very high level
and got our hitters in good
positions to compete," Rosen
said Saturday. "I really like what
she did, and that shows we have
depth at that position, which is a
great thing for us to see."
With Dannemiller's possible
extended absence, that depth
will face a tough test this
weekend when No. 19 Duke
and No. 20 North Carolina
visit Ann Arbor.
But Warner and Zhou won't
be left to their own devices
entirely. Rosen says the
setters do a great job sharing
informationtogive the teamthe
best edge it can get.
"We work together anyway
on who to set and how to
set," Warner said. "And then
definitefy when we figured
out that I was starting
(Dannemiller) really helped
me get prepared on how to run
the team."
Advice from an All-America
Honorable Mention never hurts,
but Warner has always had a
knack for directing traffic on the
court. She'll just finally be doing
it in the spotlight.

"The captain practices really
helped me because we gained a
lot of chemistry between us and
we all became good friends after
practices," Stevens said. "We were
working hard for each other."
Players that build relationships
with their teammates tend to lead,
and in order to push his team,
Daley relies on the athletes that
are displaying outstanding perfor-
mances, not just the older players.
"We have to lean on the best
guys," Daley said. "If the best guys
are the old guys, then they are, and
if it's the young guys, it's the young
guys. We have to coach them on
the fly. Sometimes, regardless of
year, you have to perform. You
have to perform and you have
to lead. You can't be a freshman
anymore. Bad teams have a lot of
young freshmen."
Michigan soccer has mature
freshmen, and right now, that's a
key to the Wolverines' success.

Some people complain that
bluefish is too oily and fishy-

cooked correctly. I begin with a
charcoal fire, and let the coals
burn down to a nice yellow-
red glow. Then, I give each
filet adifferent flavoring. One
gets slices of butter and lemon
arranged in an alternating pat-
tern on top, and the other gets
a thin coating of mustard and
mayonnaise. Either way, the
point is to keep the fish moist
while cutting its natural rich-
ness. Being hardy and fatty,
bluefish is easy to cook. I just
place both filets skin-side
down on the grill, put the cover
on, and let them bake. After
about 10 minutes, I periodi-

just a natural brininess and
clean richness.

Will Bedell's work deals with the ephemeral and dark side of the human psyche.

By AKSHAY SETH
ManagingArts Editor
The last thing William BeDell
says after being interviewed is,
"I hope I didn't say 'pussy' too
manytimes."
He's smirking, shirtless, in
front of a mass of piled painted
doors - his artwork - asa pho-
tographer casually clicks away
shots to be used in this profile.
An old record player blares
punk music in the background.
A tiny twin bed is littered with
old clothes, scrappy books and
drying paint stains. An empty
bottle of champagne skulks,
rolls on the ground. The room
is small, but like everything else
inside, it has character.
BeDell, an Art & Design
senior, hesitated for a while as
he answered questions, linger-
ing on the words and glancing
back at his work for inspiration.
When asked what pushed him
to develop an interest in art,
he shrugged before saying, "I
don't know - I just always did
it. I drew when I was younger.
I kept drawing, and when I fig-
ured I wasn't smart enough to
get where I want, I drew even
harder, painted, and then I
:came here."
He, spoke morg confideny
after the brief pauses that came
at the ends of his sentences,
making quick references to
all the past projects cluttered

around the room. "It has been
described as angsty," BeDell
said while discussing his paint-
ing, "but I wouldn't always say
that. It's usually whatever's in
my brain and whatever, from
there, I want to come out, so
it becomes kind of a diary of
sorts."
Pointing to a large door
with the word "pussy" embla-
zoned across in bright letters,
he joked, "I guess this could
be kind of angsty but it's more
reflective of what I'm thinking
and feeling all the time really."
He got the idea to paint large,
non-traditional pieces on dis-
carded doors from his tendency
to "go big" - a phrase he throws
around alot - in mostaspects of
his creativity. Instead of opting
for the customary cloth canvas
most commonly representative
of his medium, BeDell believes
splashing his thoughts on large
boards of wood can add depth
to an otherwise flat creative
process.
He did one of his earliest
door paintings while studying
abroad in London, and already
intrigued by the ability to scale
out his compositions, decided to
use the new technique as part of
his senior thesis project.
"I, was.,rlawing,. painting,
went to a lot of good shows -
a lot of the pieces I made there
were inspired by these really
great blues bars I went to," he

said. "I painted big, I painted
all the time and it was great
because I hated it, which let me
make some good work."
Usingthat experience, BeDell
is trying to formulate an idea
for his final year project. His
dollection of piecea, along with
those of every graduating Art &
Design student, will be show-
cased at the end of the school
year in a special gallery. In the
meantime, DeBell hopes to find
more galleries to display his
paintings, collectively dubbed
"the door show."
"I'm trying to look at how to
create a space with painting,
and make it more multidimen-
sional than just a piece hanging
on walls, because I really like
the action of swinging the doors
open to see the other side," he
said. "I really want to invite
viewers to geta chance to touch
the paintings and interact with
them in amore meaningful way
than just sitting and staring."
BeDell is still in the process
of laying out a definitive post-
graduation plan but he wants to
locate a larger space in Detroit
to continue developing his artis-
tic style.
"I'm hoping I can also hit the
road a little bit and get some
experience traveling. Just keep
myself working hard as ever,"
he added, before asking, "By the
way, do I need to put a shirt on
for the pictures?"

JAZZ
From Page 1B
"For me, music and life are all
about style."- Miles Davis
The first night of the Detroit
Jazz Festival is graced with a
nearly cloudless evening sky; as
the sun sets behind the Ernst &
Young building, a light breeze
sweeps across Campus Martius,
resulting in a temperature that
can be described only, perhaps
fittingly, as cool. "Cool" is a
term that gets thrown around
quite often, but it is really best
associated with this style called
Jazz, a style noted for its freedom,
improvisation and discipline
coupled with an unwavering
finesse. Cool can be interpreted
in so many ways: attractive or
impressive, calm and composed
and controlled. This night, this
Labor Day weekend in Detroit, it's
about the music, it's about history,
and most importantly, it's about
cool.
The festival's setup is simple
enough: four stages, one at
Cadillac Square next to Campus
Martius,the other three scattered
throughout Hart Plaza with the
audience facing the waterfront.
Woodward Avenue is blocked 'off
for pedestrian use from Jefferson
Avenue to Monroe Street, the
roads filled with food trucks
selling Memphis-style barbecue
and grilled chicken and tents
selling albums, t-shirts, concert
merchandise - the works. As
the evening turns to night, the
streets become more packed and
more lively as the sounds of jazz
fill the Detroit night sky: a rolling
bass line here, a smooth piano lick
there and the sweet, sweet bellow
of a tenor sax cutting through
the air. The audience bops their
heads; they close their eyes and
feel the beat, applause, repeat.
There's a rhythm to it.
The festival spans four days,
Friday evening to Monday,
with Saturday and Sunday
being the most filled in terms of
performances. The artists span
from well-known musicians to
up-and-comers to University Big
Bands, the content ranges from
new material to tribute acts. The
lineup is composed through a
meticulous, year-round process
"We weave artists in a way that
makes sense. I don't believe in
putting a bunch of artists in the
room and going 'make something
happen!' Bands are not just off
the shelf," said Chris Collins, the
festival's artistic director for the
past three years and a professor
and director of jazz studies at
Wayne State University.
As artistic director, Collins
is responsible for compiling
the festival's lineup, which
includes a constant search for
both established and new talent,
nationally and local to Detroit.
He places an importance on an
artist's abilitytodonewinnovative
things in the community, whether
it's creatingnewsounds orhelping
with educational pursuits. Both
of these are cornerstones of
jazz: Innovation couples with
improvisation, and education pairs
with history and recognizing one's
influences.
"We allbeginby beinginspired,
sometimes by a single artist; it

might be John Coltrane or Lester
Young. Whoever it is, it started
at that point, but very soon you
realize you have to move forward
and you have to move back
equally," Collins said. "You have to
move in all directions to develop as
an artist, to fill inthe holes."
The result is a well-rounded
lineup, one that is especially
impressive given that the festival
is free for everyone. Mike Ross,
Atlanta native and self-described
jazz enthusiast, travels the country
to jazz festivals like this one.
He attended the Newport Jazz
Festival in Rhode Island three
weeks ago, but claims the Detroit
Jazz Festival tops it: "This is one
of the best lineups in the country
I've ever seen, and it's free," he
said.
"Ifyousacrificeyourart
because of some woman, or
some man, or for some color, or
for some wealth, you can't be
trusted."
And it's that emphasis on a
free show that is most prideful
to Collins. "It is the belief of the
festival that it needs to remain
free," he said. "It cannot exclude
any person. It's essential in
order to keep the bar level so
that everyone involved has an
experience with the art and the
music."

Funding for the festival
comes from numerous sponsors
including JPMorgan Chase,
Comcast and the various casinos
in Detroit. Noticeably absent
are any of the Detroit 3: Ford
Motor Co., General Motors
and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.
Ford pulled its sponsorship from
the festival back in 2005, while
Chrysler pulled out just this year
after serving as the presenting
sponsor for the past two years.
These withdrawals beg the
question of just how "Detroit"
a festival can be without the
support of the companies that
define the city, especially with GM
headquarters in the Renaissance
Center peering down directly over
the festival grounds. But Collins is
confident in the festival's ability to
recoup any losses.
"We rely on a lot of different
funding sources, including
businesses and personal donors.
The festival never relies on any
one single source," he said. "That
being said, it is the largest free
jazz festival in the world and
the programming and size of it
competes with many of the largest
jazz festivals in the world, so it is a
challenge."
To encourage individuals to
give money to the festival, certain
rewards are offered for large
donations. Becoming a "Guardian
of Jazz" - requiring a donation
ranging from $500 to $5,000-plus
- resultsain such perks as reserved
seating sections directly in front of
the stage, an artist meet-and-greet
and an invitation to the opening
night VIP party. The party is
attended by many of jazz's current
great talents and features a menu
inspired by Memphis and New
Orleans cuisine - with a Detroit
twist - as well as a small, intimate
performance by a jazz band, all
setting thetone for the weekend.
Jazz Speaks for Life
This suggests a sort of
economic separation, but in
reality the festival is a melding of
characters, classes and cultures
- men and women dressed in
University of Michigan football
jerseys sit next to those clad in
the most expensive of suits. It's a
testament to the power of jazz.
"(Jazz is) emblematic of the
freedom, that we all yearn for in
our lives. It's about the ability to
be creative; it speaks to the need
for everybody to be free. Jazz is a
very democratic music,"said Ellen
Rowe, professor and chair of jazz
and contemporary improvisation
at the University, who also
performed in the festival with her
quintet this year. "Everybody has
an equal voice."
That voice, the voice of jazz,
is the theme of the festival: Jazz
speaks for life. It's a phrase
included in the opening address
of Martin Luther King, Jr., at the
1964 Berlin Jazz Festival in which
he declared, "(Jazz) is triumphant
music. Modern jazz has continued
in this tradition, singing the songs
of a more complicated urban
existence.When life itself offers no
order and meaning, the musician
createsanorderandmeaningfrom
the sounds of the earth which flow
through his instrument."
To Collins, "Jazz speaks for
life" connects the personal to the
communal. "The music of jazz
reflects the time, embraces the

moment and the culture. But "Jazz
speaks for life" is a suggestion of
how artists embrace their unique
individual existence and their
collective experiences. Their
individual life is represented
always at every club, gig or
recording session; it is a reflection
ofwho theyare andtheir particular
lifestyle," he said.
Much of that lifestyle is directly
impacted by the past; so much of
jazz requires looking to the past,
to the old masters. "I think it'svery
important to honor the legacy of
the music, to honor the artists to
come before us," Rowe said.
"When you're creating your
own shit, man, even the sky
ain't the limit."
To honor that past, Collins
assembled more tribute acts than
in years past, including Friday
night's "A Night at the Apollo," a
medley performance in the spirit
of the Apollo Theater in Harlem
that doubled as a jazz history'
lesson. The night also featured
tributes to Miles Davis and Nat
King Cole, among others. These
tributes were not impersonations,
however, but rather stepping
stones to achieving one's own
voice.
"The tribute is an homage as
recognizing the importance of

history and the legacy of what
the music is about, but also a
departure point for creating
something new based on an
existing model," Collins said.
"Jazz musicians have always
embraced the history; that doesn't
mean you have to learn every solo
and transcribe every piece, but
everything you study, everything
you break down becomes your
own voice. The hope is through
that exploration the artist can find
his own voice, his own unique
statement and through that can
contribute to the history."
To contribute to history is to
create something eternal, resilient
to time. Perhaps that's why it's so
fitting - or rather, so important -
that Detroit hosts and continues
to host this festival.
"Few cities can boast a
historic connection to jazz and
the jazz vocabulary as a whole.
We have something very special
here," Collins said. "We in this
community understand the
importance of that connection
to that legacy. All that is very
important to the Detroit sound
now and in the past. I think that's
why this yearI chose to havea few
more nods to the past, as asway of
making a strong statement."
Detroit boasts a rich musical
history, and despite the times,-
it continues to crank out new
artists. "Detroit is one of the
most important hotbeds,
most important spots for the
development of music, right there
with New York and Kansas City
and Chicago," Rowe said.
"In Detroit we keep turning
[artists] out," Collins said. "The
environment and the DNA of
the culture encourage artists
to pursue the art as voraciously
as they did 50 years ago. The
difference is we don't hear about
it. I'm a believer that we keep
producingthem."
One of the goals of the Detroit
Jazz Festival, then, is to find
those artists, to give them the
tools - whether it's education,
instruments or a stage - to have
their musical voices heard. That's
how Collins sees the future of the
festival.
"You have to look at it as a
year-round project to understand
the breadth of what we're doing:
different ways of enhancing
the community, supporting our
clubs and schools and the festival
proper, continuing to hone the
flow from stage to stage, from day
today, continuing to enhance the
festival with our projects."
The remainder of that
responsibility to the music, to
the culture of jazz, rests with the
listeners, the self-proclaimed jazz
enthusiasts and newly affiliated
alike, to go out and find the music.
"Many are doing it at the
university level which is get out
and play," Collinsasaid. "There are
plenty of clubs and jam sessions.
Get out and play: Let yourself
be heard, start bands, play at
that coffee house. Practice your
art and always make sure you're
integrating with the mentors in
your community."
And when the outside search
for the music is combined with
the festival itself, Collins believes,
the result is something incredible:
"There's something emotionally
and spiritually powerful about
that. I want people to realize that
they are a part of the functioning

organism that is the Detroit Jazz
Festival."
"You have to play a long time to
be able to play like yourself."
Anne Ross of Detroit sits
quietly in the back of the VIP
seating area, dressed elegantly yet
unassumingly. She's asked if she's
ever seen Miles Davis. She grins,
as though she knows a great secret,
and nodsher head, "I've seen them
all basically." "VIP" is a bit of an
understatement to describe Ross.
A native of Chicago, she not only
has been listening to jazz since
the 1950s; she fed and housed
some of the greats before they
became great.She doesn't learn the
history, she lived it -she's seen the
evolutionof Jazz.
"It's changed. Definitely
changed. But it's so good to see the
young listeners getinvolved."
As the first act of the festival,
The Bad Plus Joshua Redman
closes their set, the audience
gives a standing ovation. Her age
making it more difficult to rise,
Ross remains seated, but claps as
enthusiastically, perhaps more so,
than the rest. A wide smile now
rests on her face as she looks up
at the stage with passion and
earnestness.
"I couldn't ask for abetter night
for this."

RevelIing in-.horror

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Literary Columnist
Putting another book on top
was never enough. I built veritable
fortresses, arranging towers of.
chapter books on all sides of the
hideous thing to block it from'
my view. Even after I would set-
tle safely on the other side of the
room with my Barbies in tow,
there was always a prickle of
awareness, as if the buried book
pulsated with malevolence.
Some days it proved too
much for my cowardly heart to
stand, and with a deep breath
I would pick up the book, close
my eyes, run the few steps to
my older sister's room and toss
it through her door. The book
I'm referring to was, of course,
Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories
to Tell in The Dark," aka the
nightmarish "children's" book
that caused many a millennial a
sleepless night.
While most of the book's
power to disturb lies in its
ghoulish, surrealistic illustra-
-tions by Stephen Gammell, it
also served as the first introduc-
tion for many readers, myself
included, to what I consider to
be the most satisfying type of
short story: the horror/suspense
tale.
This type of short story is
rooted in the format and sensi-
bilities of earlier oral storytell-
ing traditions, traditions that
continue today when we tell
ghost stories around a camp-
fire or swap urban legends at
a slumber party. In general, a
short story uses the conven-
tional dramatic structure to
examine a singular event, which
thus encourages a specific mood
within the reader. In the case of
the horror/suspense tale, this
mood is fear.
Fear is an innate emotion.
Fear is also by its very nature
fleeting. Asa reaction to a per-
ceived threat, fear forces us
into a fight-or-flight response,
essentially making us choose
between confronting the per-
ceived threat or running away
from it.
Conflict is thus not only the
essence of drama, but also of
fear. The horror/suspense tale is
doubly bolstered by this intrin-
sic struggle towards some sort

of resolution or at least change
in state. The length of a short
story also works to the advan-
tage of this type of tale as it
sustains in totality the reader's
sense of fear longer than pos-
sible in a novel, but with a
deeper intensity than can be
accomplished through a simple
anecdote.
The horror/suspense tale also
provides the joy of emotional
release for feelings we may not
otherwise be able to alleviate
in our daily lives. Ina perverse
way, we like to be scared, but
only if it's on our own terms.
Things like horror movies and
scary stories present us a safe,
distant experience in which to
work through our emotions of
fear.
If, dear reader, you doubt my
evolutionary and structural
arguments as to why the best
short stories are also the scari-
est, the proof is most assuredly
in the pudding.,
We start with the undisputed
master of mystery and maca-
bre, Edgar Allan Poe. Though I
could reiterate praise for Poe's
most famous short stories such
as "The Cask of Amontillado"
and "The Tell-Tale Heart," and
truly wax poetic on the intense-
ly disturbing "Bernice," my
favorite short story of his would
have to be "The Masque of the
Red Death." The title in and of
itself is rather chilling.
"The Masque-of the Red
Death" tells the tale of Prince
Prospero who, when the illness
known as the "Red Death" rav-
ages his country, holes up in his
castle with other nobles in an
attempt to escape the disease.
In an effort to entertain them-
selves, a masquerade is held. All
is well until a mysterious party-
goer arrives dressed as a victim
of the "Red Death."
The story is incredibly paced,
and filled with haunting imag-
ery that is unmistakably Poe.
The "Red Death" is described in
terrifying detail, making it steem
alarmingly grounded in real-
ity. The story's end, along with
its message in general about
death's ultimate dominion over
all, doesn't leave the reader
breathless from anxiety, but
rather disconcertingly pensive.
Another American master-

piece, William Faulkner's "A
Rose for Emily," is a bit of a slow
burner. The story centers on the
eccentric and reclusive Emily
Grierson, who serves as the last
vestiges of the tradition and
grandeur of the antebellum era
for a small southern communi-
ty. Upon her death, the curious
townspeople enter her previ-
ously isolated home and make a
shockingly morbid discovery.
"A Rose for Emily" attests
to Faulkner's mastery of the
Southern Gothic, complete with
decrepit mansion and twisted
psyche. While the story doesn't
have quite the same opulence
as "The Masque of the Red
Death," "A Rose for Emily" is
filled with poignant observa-
tions on a society in transition
and those who are left behind
because of such transforma-
tions.
Lastly, we come to what I
consider to be one of, if not
the greatest, American short
story of the last century: Joyce
Carol Oates' "Where Are You
Going, Where Have You Been?"
There's a reason-this is one of
the most highly anthologized
short stories, and if you haven't
read it before, I beg you, go
read it now.
"Where Are You Going,
Where Have You Been?" cen-
ters around a vain but typical
teenager named Connie. Left
alone at home one afternoon,
Connie is accosted by Arnold
Friend, a mysterious man, with
only a screen door as protec-
tion. If your breath doesn't
quicken and your palms don't
start to sweat when reading
this story, you have steelier
nerves than I.
It's a disturbing representa-
tion of the dangers girls face
when transitioning into adult
sexuality. And while the devil-
like Arnold Friend may serve
as an extreme example of these
dangers, the truth behind the
hyperbole ringstrue.
So whether you're looking
for-a good read or a good scare,
you'll find the best of both worlds
in tales of horror/suspense. Just
makes sure to leave the light on.

"The Pout-Pout Fish" was on The
New York Times bestseller list for
children's picture books. Though
she is not an illustrator herself, she
professes a deep regardfor the work
illustrators do.
"I have been so fortunate in
the books that I have written to be
paired with illustrators who bring
the story to life, and I have admira-
tion and profound respect for that
process," she said. "With picture
books, it is what makes the books
come alive; the text is important,
but the illustrations bring italive."
Though the theme is centered on
illustration, Agnew made sure to
book a well-rounded programso the
fest can appeal to a diverse group of
attendees. Other events include a
graphic novel panel, which includes
"Speedbump" creator Dave Coverly
and a book cover redesign contest
for Michigan high school students
to be hosted by Raschka.
"This year we chose 'Paddle to
the Sea,' which is a Michigan classic
that won a Caldecott," Agnew said.

state, and they will be hanging at
the library next week, and we will
announce the winners next Friday."
Every year the feat also hosts a
Detroit panel, which is often the
most popular event of the day. This
year the panel is entitled "The Art
of the Comeback" and will feature
essayists who contributed to the
book "Detroit Resurgent," which
discusses the revitalization of the
city.
What makes the Kerrytown
BookFest unique in a city teem-
ing with literary opportunity is its
independence from the University
- a testament to Ann Arbor itself.
Though professors often participate
on panels, the event draws its power
from the local literary community
at large,uniting readers and writers,
booksellers and bookbuyers. Agnew
would love to see more cohesive stu-
dent involvement, though she rec-
ognizes the unfortunate timing of
the event in students' fall schedule.
"It's getting more and more
(support from the Ann Arbor com-

have sponsors. Our board is allvol-
unteers and they are so hardwork-
ing," Agnew said.
Both Agnew and Diesen high-
light the thriving Michigan literary
community, a segment of the popu-
lation they believe is often over-
looked, since the Great Lakes State
is better known for exporting cars
than stories. While Agnewhpg
the BookFest continues to attract
nationally known speakers, she
also places high value on featuring
locally based authors and artists,
Diesen also leverages her success
to feature other Michigan authors
on her website.
Despite the broad spectrum of
literary areas that the BookFest
emphasizes, Diesen believes it still
retains itseclectic charm, creating a
welcoming atmosphere for all.
"The Kerrytown BookFest is
unique in its energy. It's hard to
describe, but it's so welcoming
and convivial. Just a celebration of
books and authors, but also read-
ing and readers and of book lovers
of all azes
