After polar vortex,
updated policy will
guide emergency
closure decisions
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
When a polar vortex kept
the wind chill well below zero
for several days last Janu-
ary, the University canceled
a day of classes due to severe
weather for the first time since
1978. Monday, the University
released an updated policy to
guide future partial or entire'
severe weather-related clo-
sures.
Under the new policy, the
executive director of the Uni-
versity's Division of Safety
and Security is responsible for
assessing conditions and con-
sulting with experts before
providing a recommendation
to the University president
about whether to reduce Uni-

versity operations or cancel
classes.
The updated policy has been
renamed Emergency Reduc-
tion in Operations instead of
Emergency Closure in Opera-
tions, since the University
provides many critical servic-
es, such as health care provi-
sions and services in campus
residence halls, that cannot be
fully suspended.
Laurita Thomas, associ-
ate vice president for Human
Resources, chaired the com-
mittee charged with updating
the University's policy. In an
interview with The Michigan
Daily, Thomas said the Uni-
versity was never completely
closed when classes were can-
celled last January.
"All of our commitments to
research, to patient care and to
our community, the university
is never going to close, but it
can reduce operations if safe-
ty calls for that and warrants
that," she said

Michelle Obama
urges voters to back
Schauer, Peters
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily NewsEditor
First Lady Michelle Obama
campaigned in Detroit Friday for
a number of Michigan Democrats

up for office in the Nov. 4 election.
Her 30-minute speech followed
short addresses by candidates
and prominent figures including
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and
U.S. Rep. John Dingell.
The speakers underlined the
necessity to not only vote, but
encourage voting among, as
Obama said, "your family, your
neighbors and folks from church."
Obama referenced her husband's

election in 2008 when record
numbers of typically underrepre-
sented demographics voted.
"Now, a lot of people were
shocked when Barack won, you
remember that?" Obama said,
the crowd roaring "Yeah!" "They
were shocked, because they were
counting on folks like us to stay
home, but we proved them wrong,
because record numbers of
minorities and women and young

people showed up and voted."
This election is especially cru-
cial for the Michigan Democratic
Party. Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der, whose right to work legisla-
tion was repeatedly criticized
during Friday's campaign event,
is up for reelection against chal-
lenger Mark Schauer, a former
member of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.

Regents to consider
new Ross structure
dedication at
meeting Thursday
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
The University's Board of
Regents will convene Thurs-
day at the University of
Michigan - Flint's campus
to approve a handful of pro-
posals, including the nam-
ing of the new Ross School of
Business academic Building
for University alum and real
estate executive Jeff Blau.
In a communication to the
regents, Business Dean Ali-
son Davis-Blake and Douglas
Strong, interim executive vice
president and chief financial
officer, wrote that Blau had
made a $5 million donation to
the school, on top of a previous
$4 million gift in 2006.
The 104,000-square-foot
academic building will be con-
structed on the corner of East

University Avenue and the
Monroe Mall, on the site of
the school's former Computer
and Executive Education facil-
ity. The new building is part
of a $135 million construc-
tion project, which is aiming
to add additional office and
classroom space and create a
cohesive look for the entire
Business School campus.
The project is largely fund-
ed by a gift from real estate
mogul Stephen Ross, a Uni-
versity alum who made a
record-breaking $200 million
donation to the University last
fall: The gift was to be evenly
split between the namesake
Ross School of Business and
the Athletic Department.
Last spring, the University's
regents voted to name the
rename much of south campus
the Stephen M. Ross Athletic
Campus.
In September, the regents
approved the construction of
a $168 million South Campus
athletics facility, funded in
part by the Ross donation.

UCLA survey indicates recent grads have more debt

The University of California,
Los Angeles conducted a survey
that looked at doctoral alumni
from schools in the UC system
and their student loan debt, The
Daily Bruin reportedTuesday.
UCLA conducted the survey
for the first time this year and
looked at graduates with doctoral
degrees over the last 40 years.
26,000 alumni were surveyed,
but only 7,200 responded. Of the
respondants, 99 percent said they
were employed.
Unsurprisingly, the surveyalso
showed that alumni who gradu-
ated in recent years were more
likely to have student debt than
alumni who graduated in the
1970s.

Princeton seeks investigator

cases that arise during academic
vacations.
This addition will be the sec-
ond staff hiring related to sexual
assault cases since Princeton was
pressured by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education's Office for

Ford School hosts talk
on impact of social work

Lecturer shares.
research regarding
hypermarginalized
populations
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
While many students
decamped from Ann Arbor for Fall
Break Friday, Megan Comfort, a
research sociologist and professor
at the University of California, San
Francisco, presented her research
on integrating social work and
ethnography with what she calls
hypermarginalized populations -
people in extreme poverty affect-
ed by mental illness, poor health,
substance use, incarceration or
homelessness.
Comfortspoke in apresentation
for the Ford School of Public Poli-
cy titled "Integrating Social Work
and Ethnography with Hypermar-
H-S

ginalized Populations." The talk
was co-sponsored by the School of
Social Work Learning Community
on Poverty and Inequality.
Comfort's new research study,
which involved the innovative step
of incorporating a social worker
into intervention-based research
in addition to a researcher. The
study followed 20 impoverished
residents of Oakland, Calif.,
between the ages of 26 and 59.
None of the 20 participants had
stable housing, and many suffered
from mental illness, substance
abuse, sexual abuse and repeated
incarceration.
She aimed to investigate how
the impoverished navigate their
surroundings and how the addi-
tion of a social worker can affect
their experiences.
Comfort used the case of"Char-
lie," the pseudonym for a partici-
pant in the study, to illustrate the
challenges hypermarginalized
populations face.
Charlie is a 46-year-old, HIV-
5-M

positive man who suffers from
social phobia, depressive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder and
drug and alcohol addiction. He has
been repeatedly incarcerated and
had been unable to secure perma-
nent housing because of his felony
record.
Ultimately, Charlie's social
worker was able to secure him
subsidized housing. However,
his parole officer told him he was
legallyunable to live there because
the housing was outside of the
county where he was incarcer-
ated. This left Charlie with the
choice between living illegally in
a stable home or living legally on
the street.
Comfort repeatedly mentioned
and critiqued the "Kafkaesque"
bureaucratic institutions that the
extremely poor must navigate.
She also presented the case of
"Crystal," a 35-year-old woman
on probation and parole. Crystal
became homeless at age 11, began
using drugs at age 14 and is a sur-
vivor of repeated physical and sex-
ual abuse. She has been in and out
of jail, at one point returning four
days after she was released.
On one occasion, Crystal went
to the hospital following a violent
sexual assault. She arrived there
wearing only underwear, and was
treated and released that night
without shoes and only wearing a
hospital gown. She had no identifi-
cation or money.
Since Crystal had chosen not to
press charges for sexual assault,
she was not eligible to be taken in
by a domestic violence center, leav-
ing her with nowhere to go.
Comfort explained how Crystal
was able to find shelter because
she called her social worker,
underscoring the importance and
value of social workers and the
impact they're able to have on the
communities they serve.
Public Policy Lecturer Megan
Tompkins-Stange said the presen-
tation will stick with her and alter
the ways she thinks about this
work moving forward.
"In this paper you have given
voice to thevoiceless," she said.

there was also a focus on recent
Taubman Scholars and the con-
tributions that they are making
with their own research proj-
ects.
The Alfred A. Taubman Medi-
cal Research Institute prides
itself in supporting clinician-
scientists with the resources to
make advances in biomedical
research that will translate to.
real world solutions to those suf-
fering from life-threatening dis-
eases. With such a goal in mind,
the Institute's tagline reads,
"where scientists create cures."
Part of the Institute's success
lies in its expanding influence.
From its conception with four
Taubman Scholars and no clini-
cal trials, it has grown to encom-
pass 31 Taubman Scholars and 51
clinical trials.
"I think that our biggest
accomplishment is our growth
and our outreach and really
meeting our mission because we
are scientists and we are creat-
ing cures," said Neurology Prof.
Eva Feldman, director of the
Taubman Institute.
Carl June, a professor of the
Perelman School of Medicine
at the University of Pennsylva-
nia, introduced his promising
research that will hopefully lead
to a cure for leukemia. Dr. June's
work is particularly compelling
to clinicians because it intro-
duces an alternative to previous
cancer treatments, chemother-
apy and radiation, in the hopes
that it will produce not only bet-
ter survival rates, but also fewer
side effects.
Oncology Prof. Max Wicha,
deputy director of the institute,
said June's work is extremely

innovative because he "has
brought together these two
areas of research, that is the area
of gene therapy and the area of
tumor immunotherapy, to actu-
ally genetically engineer the
body's immune cells to specifi-
cally fight cancer."
After being introduced by
both Wicha and Alfred Taub-
man, the founder and chair of the
Taubman Institute, June delved
into the specifics of the origins of
his research, where the research
currently stands today, and what
he envisions for the future.
June's treatment caters to
patients by using their own T
cells - a type of white blood cell
is important for immunity - to
personalize immunotherapy.
His gene transfer therapy allows
the cancerous body to overcome
tolerance, or the activation of the
immune system that ultimately
prevents the body from destroy-
ing the tumor, through synthetic
biology.
Through this synthetic biolo-
gy, the body's own immune cells
can be fundamentally changed
so that they are able to attack
cancerous tumors.
After testing his new therapy
with three adults, June moved
toward helping children, affirm-
ing the importance in doing so
by relaying that the number one
cause of disease-related pedi-
atric deaths is leukemia. Treat-
ment options for these children
are especially limited to those
who may fail bone marrow
transplants, which are already
dangerous to begin with.
With his new therapy, June
found a 90 percent response rate
in his trial patients. The first
patient that he treated, a young
girl, has been cancer free for
more than two years.
June also discussed the
potential for his new therapy

to go beyond leukemia to solid
tumors. Clinical trials are being
initiated to look into this possi-
bility, although there are poten-
tial complications regarding cell
toxicity.
While his results are very
promising, Dr. June also rec-
ognized some of the problems
that his new treatment will face.
There will be regulatory and
manufacturing challenges, in
part due to the high cost of treat-
ment, a function of the treatment
specificity.
June reminded the audience
that patients and doctors will
need to be fully educated on the
new treatment - patient issues
as common as diarrhea, when
treated traditionally, potentially
become life threatening.
In his presentation, June
expressed his excitement about
the potential effect that this new
therapy could have on children
with leukemia.
"I loved taking care of
patients, and I thought that I
would do that the rest of my
life," June said. "Then I started
having the opportunity to do
some research, and it gradually
became what I do 100 percent of
the time."
This experience seems to
encapsulate the Institute's
motto, and Taubman himself
summed up the importance of
Friday's event.
"I think that (biomedical
research) is important to any-
one who realizes that there's so
much sickness around, so much
ill health, and if you're ina posi-
tion where you can bring people
together, and you can get great
minds together," he said. "We
can solve sickness and make peo-
ple healthier. I think that there is
a great opportunity."

After a decade of featuring a

Edgefest decided to incorporate
themes to better select the piec-
es to be showcased. After much
deliberation, this year's theme
- Bass - was chosen. Deanna
Relyea, founder of the Kerry-

hand picked some of the acts
to go with the bass theme, but
many artists volunteered to play
at such a prestigious event.
"Well, it's very organic in a
way, because (the artists) know
us," Relyea said. "Edgefest
quickly became a beacon for
these musicians in the Midwest
and they would use us on their
tours."
One of those artists, William
Parker, is doing a workshop for
kids at Scarlet Middle School.
These young musicians, along
with many of the artists playing
Edgefest, will join together for a
parade on Saturday at noon. They
will march together through the

streets of Kerrytown, showcas-
ing their musical talent.
Along with a vast number of
great bassists, including Mark
Helias who will be playing solo
as well as in a duo with Mark
Dresser as the Marks Brothers,
students from the University will
be featured at Edgefest. On Sat-
urday at St. Andrew's Episcopal
Church, the UM Creative Arts
Orchestra, directed by Mark
Kirschenman, will join forces
with all Edgefest artists to create
a concert of works for multiple
basses. This will be a take off of
the "Deep Listening" routines
recently undertaken by Dresser
at bass conventions. These rou-
tines involve using the internet
to hook up to bass players around
the world and create a huge
group collaborative piece. In the
same vein, the "Body of Basses"
at St. Andrew's will incorpo-
rate the same innovative group
dynamics to create improvised
pieces.
"It's truly a festival of music
on the edge with artists who are
continually striving to movie
their disciplines into new ter-
ritories," Aspenes said. "Music,
at the edge."

of Obama's statements were
affirmed by audience members
who cried "That's right!" or "Yes,
we can."
Lifelong Detroit resident
Wendy Yuille said the Demo-
cratic candidates this election
resonate with her. Yuille was
unemployed last year and said
her benefits were compromised
by gridlock in Congress.
"There's no one advocating
for people, the day to day people,
the people who are just trying to
work 40 hours a week, do an hon-
est day's work for an honest day
pay," Yuille said. "Who speasfor

Croswell resident Gloria
Finnegan drove two hours to
Detroit for the event with her
husband. A retired teacher from
the Dearborn school district,
Finnegan said she supports
Democratic candidates who
fight for pay equity, minimum
wage and legalized abortion.
Senator Debbie Stabenow,
who is not up for reelection, was
one speaker who emphasized
the equalizing nature of elec-
tions.
"Republicans are hoping they
can buy the election with their
billionaire buddies but the great
thing about our country is that it
doesn't matter how much money
you have inyour pocket whenyou
get to the polls," Stabenow said.
"Everyone gets one vote."
Speakers also touched on the
Affordable Care Act, recovering
U.S. automotive industry, pay

"Cabaret" opened on Broad-
way in 1966 and was an overnight
success. Over the years it went
through many various revivals
and even spawned a movie in 1972
starring Liza Minnelli ("Arrested
Development "). The production
won a Tony Award for Best Reviv-
al in 1998 thanks in part to the
incredible cast, which was led by
thetalentedAlan Cumming("The
Good Wife"), who brought the
show back to Broadway in early
2014. And now, the latest group to
take on the musical is the Univer-
sity's School of Music, Theatre &
Dance.
The main plot of "Cabaret"
revolves around two couples. Cliff
Bradshaw, an American, trying
to write his novel, travels to Ber-
lin, where he stumbles upon Sally
Bowles, a British singer at the
Kit Kat Club; the two instantly
hit it off. They soon begin living
together in a boardinghouse run

by Fraulein Schneider, who soon
falls in love with one of her other
tenants, Herr Schultz, an elderly
Jewish fruit-shop owner. The
remainder of the musical shows
how each couple navigates the
rapidly changing and increasingly
dangerous political climate as the
Nazi party slowly gains control.
The audience is led through the
show by the unnamed Emcee of
the club, a comic, dark and some-
times rather sexual character.
"The Emcee and the. Kit Kat
Boys and Girls are really acting
as a Greek chorus throughout the
show and are motivating a lot of
the action," said Joe Locarro, the
show's director and a visiting pro-
fessor at the University. "They do
interact with the characters in the
scenes fromtime to time so Ithink,
that it really brings it all together
in the way that the Emcee is con-
trolling the entire evening."
One of the major themes
throughout the show is sexual
identity, as Berlin was known for
being rather accepting of all forms
of sexuality during this time peri-
od. The amount of overt sexuality
present inthe production, though,
depends solely on the director,
with the 1998 revival as well as
the 2014 restaging of said revival
being much more sexual than
earlier productions. For SMTD's
interpretation, Locarro felt there
was no need to be blatantly sexual.
"I felt that it doesn't really help
the story personally," Locarro
said. "It still has all the bump and
grind, but not as much groping."
Because so much of the show
takes place within the Kit Kat
Club, several structural changes
were made to the stage to enhance
the atmosphere for the audience
within the theatre.
"I wanted to make this produc-
tion as environmentally relevant

as possible. I wanted to transform
the theatre as much as we could,"
Locarro said. "So we built the
stage over the orchestra pit and
tried to create avery intimate set-
ting as it would be in a club."
But the stage was not the only
thing added to the production to
make the theatre feel more like a
real cabaret. Several historically
accurate cabaret songs will be
performed on stage as audience
members take their seats.
"We wanted Catherine Walker
(Adams), the musical director, to
do a pre-show, so we've actually
added six characters to the show
that aren't normally there, and
then those characters are singers
and patrons of the club," Locarro
explained. "What happens is
they start off on stage when the
audience is coming in about 15
minutes before the show starts
and they are singing a number of
period pieces and period songs in
German, French and English, and
we wanted to give the feeling that
we're in a club."
While the show has numer-
ous songs that are fun and catchy,
Locarro believes the show's over-
all message will be what sticks
with the audience the most, espe-
cially today in a world rife with
political and social discrimina-
tion.
"Oddlyenough Iwas driving to
rehearsal and I drove by a number
of people holdingthese large signs
saying 'Boycott Israel' and things
like that, and they were doing
this right in front of a synagogue
and to see that in this day and age
was shocking," Locarro said. "So
I think the story that this musi-
cal tells is very important and the
sad reality is that history tends
to repeat itself, so we need to
keep reminding ourselves of the
importance of things like this."

unemployment across the nation
has fallen from about 10 percent
in Oct. 2009 to 5.9 percent in Sep-

"So, Michigan, while we still
have plenty of work to do, we
have truly made so much of that
change we were talking about,"
Obama said.
Education and its loss of
funding in recent years were
discussed; however, higher edu-
cation was not specifically pro-
moted by most of the speakers or
Obama.
The first lady also discussed
the need to ensure America is a
safe and supportive environment
for children. She mentioned chil-
dren she has met who must face
trying home lives and dangerous
neighborhoods while attempting
to succeed.
"These kids have every rea-
son to give up, but they are so
hungry to succeed," Obama said.
"They are so desperate to lift
themselves up. What we have
to remember is that they are the
reason we are here today. That's
why I'm here, I don't know about
you, but I'm here for those kids
who never give up. And we can't
give up on our kids."
Michigan has recently hosted
other famous faces looking to
promote their party. Former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Rom-
ney visited Livonia last week to
campaign for Michigan politi-
cians. Former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton is set to visit
Michigan next week and rumors
abound that President Barack
Obama himself will stop in the
state before the Nov. 4 election.

Jeffrey Robinson, assistant
director at Rutgers University's
Center for Urban Entrepreneur-
ship and Economic Develop-
ment, delivered the keynote
speech at the event. He spoke
about the work CUEED has done
in its efforts to revitalize New-
ark, N.J., along with other urban
communities in the state.
Robinson's address was struc-
tured around the three main les-
sons about how to be a successful
entrepreneur in an urban environ-
ment that he learned from being a
part of CUEED: finding collabora-
tors and partners, being ready to
pivotandknowingyouraudiences.
The event also included four
different panels: Urban Entre-
preneurship Case Studies, Com-
munity Engagement Methods,
Student-Led Entrepreneurship
and Facilitating Urban Entrepre-
neurship.
Nick Tobier, an associate
professor in the School of Art
& Design, also spoke about the
courses that he offers at the Uni-
versity and the projects that he
oversees such as Detroit Com-
munity Apparel, a joint initiative
involving University students
and Detroit high school students.
Tobier's goal is to engage
youth in revitalizing Detroit
communities.
"I am concerned deeply that if
our best and brightest students
see their communities as places
to get out of and education as
separate from the community,
those students will perpetually
go to the center," Tobier said.
"We then perpetually disadvan-
tage those places that need our
brightest the most."
Jill Ford, special counselor
to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan

tee wanted to centeralize the
decision to best promote the
community's safety.
Under the updated policy,
leaders at UM-Flint and UM-
Dearborn will continue to have
discretion to make their own
service reduction decisions dur-
ing weather emergencies.
A few weeks before the Uni-
versity's 2014 "cold day," some
students criticized the admin-
istration for allowing classes to
resume after Winter Break, even
amid sub-zero temperatures and
delayed flights.
At a meeting of the Universi-
ty's Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs the next
week, University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack said the University
did not have a substantial plan
in place to close the University if
necessary.
"By the time it became
clear that we were facing an
extraordinary weather event,
we realized that we didn't have

appropriate mechanisms to close
the University even if we wanted
to," she said. "Closing a universi-
ty is more like closing a city than
closing a building. You can't just
close; there is a hospital, there is
a police force, there are students
on campus who need to be fed."
As a result, the University's
executive vice presidents called
for a faculty and staff commit-
tee to review the University's
plans to reduce operations in an
emergency weather situation.
The committee consisted of 24
faculty and staff members from a
variety of units and completed a
report of final recommendations
in April.
"We've done work on clarity,
we are working on our continu-
ity of operations plans, we want
to focus on our effectiveness
going forward should we have
another severe weather event,"
Thomas said.

t all started in Walgreens last
week while I waited in line to
buy Vaseline for my dry eyes.
The girl in front
of me was yapping
into the phone
about this girl in
her anthro class
who always wears
sweatpants with
"JUICY"plastered -
all shiny on the
butt. "She's such YARDAIN
a basic bitch," she AMRON
said and laughed.
Her friend's laugh
cackled through the speaker.
I had heard the label around the
block, but never gave it too much
thought; a Basic Bitch was just one of
those silly slang monikers trending
these days - like 'Flapper' did in the
'20s, or'Valley Girl'inthe '80s (thank
you Google). But as I smeared fresh
Vaseline over my eyes that night as
per usual, my mind was filled with
Basic Bitch thoughts - I mean ... shit
... thoughts about Basic Bitches. Let's
just say Ihad a weird Fall Break...
Using a godly tool called Google
Advanced Search, I traced the ety-
mological roots of Basic Bitch back
to its origin. As far as I can tell, the
first reference is an August 2009
YouTube bathroom rant by a Black
comedian stage-named Spoken Rea-
sons. For almost three minutes, the
then-21-year-old offers a frustrat-
ingly specific list of ostensive defini-
tions for a Basic Bitch - all while he
is crouching on the toilet. Like: "if
you bend yo ass over in all yo pictures
just to make ita lil bigger knowin you
ain't got one, you a basic bitch."
Or
"if you sing any Beyonce song all
day erryday, somethin' like "upgrade"
and ain't nothin upgraded about you
since high school in '92 ... u a basic
bitch." (Transcription credited to
urbandictionary-wonder "thekay-
two").
Some definitions made me laugh
and more drew the feminist out
in me. But I still couldn't picture

her exactly, that quintessential
Basic Bitch.
Then during the game on Sat-
urday, a girl I didn't know walked.
through my living room wearing a
blue tutu. Because I plan to make
use of a tutu in my Halloween cos-
tume, I asked her where she got it.
She said, "MDen," and I didn't hear
her right and said something stu-
pid like, "What's Mdone?" and then
she said, "Yeah, I know, I'm a basic
bitch." She walked out before I could
say anything.
I felt kinda bad, but then real-
ized this was a semi-breakthrough:
If Basic Bitches shop at MDen, and
the opposite of MDen is like a thrift
shop, and thrift shops are for Indies
(and Hipsters trying to be Indies, but
no one likes those kids so who cares),
and Indies are non-conforming non-
conformists - then Basic Bitches are
"... unflinchingly upholding of the
status quo and stereotypes of their
gender without
even realizing-
it." (Fifth defini-
tion credited to Why has
the other-urban- blown up jU
dictionary-won-
der "Cee Gee"). Or, why dc
Ergo, tutu-girl
was by definition women us
not a Basic Bitch m
in view of the more th
fact that Basic
Bitches never
call themselves Basic Bitches. It's
like The Game, you know, that we all
played back in middle school; once
you think about The Game you lose.
Some crude amount of Vaseline
later, I hit more gold. College Humor
had directly solved my problem six
months ago with the gem: "How
To Tell If You're A Basic Bitch." I
learned that Basic Bitches "experi-
ment with North Face," "have full-
blown 'Sex and the City' brunches"
and are "into scented candles"
(among other things).
It was at this point that I finally
realized how late to the game I was.
A good chunk of my audience would

probably already know everything I
just wrote. But, I wasn't about to just
scrap this whole column because Sm
not up to date or whatever.
So I went looking for some signifi-
cance in all this Basic Bitch business.
Like: Why has the term blown up
just recently? Or, why does it seem
women use the term more than men?
Aren't its inherent misogynistic
and sexist undertones obvious? Or,
can men also be Basic Bitches? And
if not, is there a male equivalent to
the phrase? And if not, can someone
think of one please and make a video
about it? Pleeease.
But all those questions feel too
heavy, so I'll just leave them there.
Sure,mostgirlswouldprobablynever
want to be called a Basic Bitch. But
there's something about the phrase
that I just can't take seriously, some-
thing cheeky about the way Wal-
greens-girl and tutu-girl said it. The
phrase is too silly. That quintessen-
tial Basic Bitch

that I was look-
ing for - she's
the term the stereotype
.st recently? of a stereotype,
the Basic Basic
)es it seem Bitch.
We all gener-
e the term alize each other
an men? to make sense of
this ridiculously
complex planet.
And that's OK
to an extent, if we didn't, we would
still be drooling toddlers. But there's
something condescending about the
way Basic Bitch is thrown around by
people, like s/he doing the throwing
actually thinks s/he's better than the
Basic Bitch just named, when actu-
ally s/he's just being extremely sim-
ple-minded, and, well, basic. Come
on, can't you think of something
more original? Maybe the most Basic
of Bitches is actually s/he who calls
others Basic Bitches. Whoa, I need
more Vaseline - my eyes are crusty.

SHERRIE A. KOSSOUDJI I
Tackling sexual assault on campus

Football is the bad boy of abusive behavior
right now and it's no wonder, many people
say, since the game itself is so violent. But as
we excoriate the NFL for lenient decisions in
the face of domestic violence we expose our
willful blindness to the simple ubiquity of
violence against women. Why is it front-page
news that there is a history of lenience in the
NFL when there is also a history of lenience
in police departments, dean's offices, the
military and the workplace?
Blaming the NFL is an easy out. There
are so many articles in newspapers about
violence against women that the real news
is that we still won't acknowledge that it
is thoroughly pervasive. Violence against
women is an inconvenient and ever-present
virus and, like the common cold, we do not
take it seriously - whether the perpetrator
is an NFL athlete, a TV star, a millionaire, a
boss, a college student, a politician, a date, a
stranger or a husband.
I am a football fan. I think of it, at its best, as
conflictballet. What a beautiful sport. The NFL
personal conduct policy should be as complete,
well-thought-out and practiced as a team's
plays when it is six points down and there are
only 30 seconds on the clock. But it's not. When
the indictment of bad behavior goes up against
making money, justice almost always loses. We
need to make ignoring this problem hurt the
bottom line. Change from the inside is easiest,
but there just aren't enough NFL players who
are victims of violence against women to push
for change from the inside.
I am also a professor. College is not a
violent sport. Yet sexual assault and other
violent acts against women commonly take
place and are commonly ignored. College
and university administrations are just
beginning to acknowledge that they should

deal more forthrightly with sexual assault
on campus. A history of protecting athletes,
paying attention to the bottom line in athletic
revenue, covering up allegations against
other students and professors to protect the
university's reputation and paying attention
to the bottom line in tuition receipts helps to
maintain higher education as a big business.
But we can make change from the inside
on college campuses. Women are often
more than 50 percent of the student body
and they, along with their fellow male
students, have the power to quickly change
behavior and attitudes about violence against
women. College students, demand that your
university create and consistently act upon
a sexual assault policy. If it doesn't, stop
attending sports events, stop purchasing
college logo items and consider a transfer
to a school that does. High school seniors,
ask the university where you plan to attend
to provide you with university policy and
actions on sexual assaults. Inform them that
you will not attend if they lack a reasonable
and enforced policy. Mothers and fathers,
don't pay for your children to attend a
school that is cavalier about violence against
women, and tell it why you choose to pay
instead for attendance at another college or
university. With the power of our numbers,
an acceptance of violence against women
would be accompanied by a serious dent in
reputation and revenues.
Maybe we can expect to begin to change
behavior in places like the NFL when
violence against women is unacceptable on
college campuses.

I have a big secret.
(Hint: it's not that big).
But I'll get to that in a minute.
First, let me tell you about myself.
I am a runner. And when I say
runner, I mean someone who
genuinely enjoys the act of running.
I don't do it for the competition,
I don't do it so that I can fit into
a size two (I can't, by the way), I
do it because it gives me real joy
that keeps me relatively sane. I
train for marathons because to me,
going for a 16-mile run is an act of
meditation. Being a runner, I have
great legs. Yeah, you heard right.
My legs are awesome. But it's not
because I think they're thin (what is
a thigh gap?). I don't consider myself
skinny. I don't consider myself fat
either, because, well, obviously
there's a middle ground. But I think
somehow there has emerged this
binary of skinny and, as many label
it, "curvy" that we have created.
And the weird thing is, "we" is
usually women, typically fueled,
sadly, by a resentment that tends to
follow body image insecurities. And
it is absolutely ridiculous.
Take, for example, two of the
most popular songs right now: "Ana-
conda," and "All About That Bass."
Both express resentment toward the
group of women formally referred
to as "the skinny bitches." Although
I do not personally identify as a
"skinny bitch," I still think that the
underlying messages in these songs
are both immature and damaging.
Nicki Minaj sings (sings?) "Fuck
those skinny bitches," and ends her
message there, celebrating her "fat
ass" by insulting those without one.
Meghan Trainor also attempts to
celebrate her body and her booty,
saying "I'm bringing booty back /Go

ahead and tell them skinny bitches
that." She then adds the incredibly
condescending remark, "No I'm just
playing, I know you think you're
fat," as if body image issues that so
many women face should be taken
lightly. As if it is some sort of joke
that by age six, girls begin to be con-
cerned about their weight, and in
the United States alone, 20 million
women suffer from eating disorders.
Saying, "Every inch of you is perfect
from the bottom to the top," is then
just a nice backhanded compliment.
One of my friends recently posted
a picture of herself on Facebook that
juxtaposed a picture from about a
year ago and a picture from a few
weeks ago, clearly showing how
much weight she has lost. It got
138 likes. People that she hadn't
talked to in years, or that she had
forgotten she was even friends
with on Facebook, were liking this
picture. Compliments rained down.
Yes, the change is quite remarkable
and damn, she looks great. But do
any of these 138 people know that
she is takingmedicine that all but
obliterates her appetite? That she
sometimes goes entire days without
feeling any desire to eat, and
sometimes finds herself physically
weak after completing simple tasks
like sweeping the floor? She knows
it's not healthy, and we've talked
about my concern for her health.
And she's really trying to change,
to eat more, eat healthier and to
remind herself that even if she
doesn't feel hungry, she needs to
give her body fuel. But other people
don't see this. They don't see health.
They see curvy and they see skinny.
Because I hold the uncommon
combination of being both a runner
and a vegetarian, maybe I am more

aware than many women of basic
nutritional needs. I must pay closer
attention to how much protein,
iron and calories in general I am
eating; luckily for me, I get to make
sure I'm getting enough. I eat when
I'm hungry, I stop when I'm full
(sometimes) and I do my best to
eat as many fruits and vegetables
and natural foods as I can. I am
hyperaware of my health because I
have to be. You can't run marathons
on (only) mac and cheese.
This is where the secret comes in.
I weigh about 150 pounds.
There, I said it.
Andthethingis, Ialways feelkind
of ashamed to admit that number.
Although this is a perfectly
healthy weight for someone my age
and height, it does put me at the
80th weight percentile. And the
funny thing is, you'd never guess it
if you saw me. In fact, my friends are
actually comfortable joking about
how "fat" Iam, becausetheythink it
is absurd that I or anyone else would
ever consider me fat. Which is why
the only time I ever bother stepping
on a scale is when I'm at the doc-
tor's office - it's just not something
I worry about.
Does my weight matter? God,
no. I am healthy, and that is what
matters. Do I sometimes (OK, maybe
more than sometimes) supplement
myblack beans and kale with a large
quantity of chocolate? Definitely.
But rather than focusing so much
on "skinny" or "fat," or numbers on
a scale, we need to start focusing
on health, and how we feel. On the
health scale, I'm doing great. Hell, I
can run 26.2 miles. And then eat as
much as Idamn well please.

tion with your boss, "The Good

of football. It's easy to forget
that a bad day is a bad day, no
matter how big or small the
problems seem. The joyful but
flighty "Alexander and the Ter-
rible, Horrible, No Good, Very
Bad Day" follows two very bad
days in the life on one particu-
larly good family - with a lot of
unnecessary schmaltz, we are
shown how these terrible, hor-
rible moments can tie a family
together.
Based on the bestselling chil-
dren's book by Judith Viorst,
"Alexander" charts two days
in the life of the Coopers, an
infuriatingly cheerful subur-
ban postcard family - the first
in which 12-year-old Alexander
(played with lispy gravitas by Ed
Oxenbould) undergoes a series
of 12-year-old misfortunes, and

bad happens to everyone else. In

it better than
director Ira Sachs's ("Keep the
Lights On") latest film.
The movie takes a look at love
through the life of a recently
married same-sex couple, Ben
(John Lithgow, "This is 40") and
George (Alfred Molina, "The
Normal Heart") and the struggles
they go through when George
loses his job at a local Christian
school after their marriage. They
are forced to rely on the supportof
their friends and close family and
go through a journey that defines
them and the bond they share.
The wonderful thing about
this movie is that it's very real,
in the sense that it deals with
issues that actually occur in the
lives of ordinary people. Budget
constraints, family tensions and
relationship pressures are dealt
with without the unnecessary

Here's a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad caption.

of Alexander's errant midnight
birthday wish (complete with a
requisite half-moon and eerie
howl) that for once someone else
understands what it's like to be
him - that his perfect family
has a bad day for once in their
lives.
Steve Carell ("Despicable Me
2") and Jennifer Garner ("Men,
Women & Children") carry
the film as Alexander's consis-
tently caring, supportive, goofy,
movie-perfect parents, juggling
four kids and work (Garner) and
being unemployed with aplomb
(Carell). The dynamics of the
Coopers are concurrently sickly
sweet and endearing - while the
script is littered with nausea-
inducing morality checkmarks,
as their bad day progresses, it's
easy to spot your own family in
this lovingly frazzled one.
Despite the strong cast, "Alex-
ander" becomes bogged down
in the slapstick qualities of a
day gone wrong. Cue the pro-
jectile vomit, the poop jokes,
the crashes and Bunsen burner
fires and pee-induced slips of a
film invested more in its actors
than the quality of its script.
The Coopers' relatability puts
the film in an unusual predica-
ment - because we actually kind
of like themr, we commiserate
with their misfortunes, cringing
when we should be laughing. It's
an unfortunate quandary - why
watch a movie about someone

else's bad day when you would
never want to experience that
day yourself?
But at its heart, "Alexander"
is just a kids movie - almost
refreshingly simple in the sea
of overly self-aware, adult-ref-
erential children's movies of
late. The silly hijinks are amus-
ing and the characters certainly
recognizable - Carell as the
goofy dad you love to be embar-
rassed by, Garner the generous
mom who always knows what
to say. Though the morals are
heavy-handed, they are deliv-
ered earnestly - in particular
by Oxenbould, who already
demonstrates both comedic and
dramatic range. He manages
to give lines like this, without
seeming disingenuous: "Gotta
have the bad days, so you can
love the good days even more."
Groan-inducing, but it's not
wrong - and not a bad lesson to
be teaching kids.
The manic positivity that
rings throughout "Alexander"
may not always be enjoyable,
but at its core it's infectious.
It's not a film that leaves you
questioning the meaning of life,
but, frankly, there already are
too many of those. It's a film to
bring a moody 12-year-old to,
and watch him giggle at Steve
Carell in a pirate costume and
forget his own bad days for a
few hours. Sometimes movies
can be as simple as that.

Manhattan.
melodrama that usually comes
along with romantic movies in
the West. The movie gets down to
the things that affect people going
through a difficult time in their
relationship and presents them
in a manner that seems relatable,
even to an audience that might
belong to a different generation.
Because of the plot's relative
simplicity, it's easier to appreciate
the acting of the entire cast.
Sometimes, acting is not so much
"doing" as it is "being," and the
lead pair takes on this mantle in a
beautiful, powerful way. Lithgow
and Molina turn in natural and
unrestrained performances,
and the way one plays off the
other is a lesson in on-screen
chemistry. The actions of every
character, lead and supporting,
have an almost palpable effect
on the others, and it's great to
see a ripple effect taking place
every time multiple characters
are involved in a scene. The film
also delivers a strong, poignant
message about love - one that's

difficult to explain but easy to
feel. It's the ineffability of the
emotion that the film oozes that
makes it special, but at times, it's
also its downfall.
Though few and far between,
some events in the film are
understated to an ambitious
degree. Not much is made clear,
and at times the viewer is left
wondering about the actual
significance of what has just been
said or happened. It's not a hard
movie to follow, it's just that some
important nuances may be lost
on viewers. Although not much
happens, it's difficult to make
sense of all the thingsthat do and
that's what makes it a strange
movie to watch.
Overall, the wonderful acting
and the simplistic, splendid
storytelling keep the film
buoyant, and the subtle tone of
humor makes it enjoyable. The
running time of 94 minutes is
perfect, as it ends up being soft
and delicate in its handling, but
powerful in its message.

audiences the fastest man alive in
their new show "The Flash."
Barry Allen (Grant Gustin,
"Glee") is a brilliant forensic
analyst who always wants to help
people and do the right thing;
however, he doesn't always
possess the strength or speed
to succeed. That is, until Barry
is struck by lightning created
by a malfunctioning particle
accelerator that suddenly gifts
him with super speed.
Gustin's Barry is an instantly
likeable character; he's
idealistic and admirable in his
ambitions, but it's not born
out of naivete. The murder
of Barry's mother and the
wrongful imprisonment of his
father, shown in the show's
openingflashbacks, playoff the
tradition of tragic superhero
origins. Instead of hardening
Barry, it opens him to the
world, making him want to
help others and make it a better
place.
Barry's relationships with
three different father figures
form the emotional weight of
the pilot. There is the father
Barry lost, Henry Allen (John
Wesley Shipp, the 1990 version
of "The Flash"), who shares
a scene with his adult son at
the pilot's end. The next is the
father Barry has, Detective
Joe West (Jesse L. Martin,
"Law and Order"), who has
cared for Barry most of his
life. And, finally, we have
the mentor Barry may gain
in Dr. Harrison Wells (Tom
Cavanagh, "Ed"). The most
dynamic and contentious of
the three, Wells is responsible
for the malfunctioning particle
accelerator that gave Barry his
superpowers. Because of the
disaster, Wells lost everything
while Barry unintentionally
reaped the benefits of his
tragedy. Wells' cynical, realist
nature plays off Barry's
optimism, and alhough Wells
decides to help the young hero,
his true motives remain to be

seen.
Directed by David Nutter
(of the infamous Game of
Thrones episode "The Rains of
Castamere"), the pilot begins to
develop all these relationships
while maintaining a strong
sense of pacing. The
introduction of Barry's powers
starts with traces and steadily
grows in displays. There's the
world slowing down because
Barry is moving so fast, a la
"The Matrix" and Barry's super
speed resembles yellow and red
lightning. The powers escalate
with each appearance as Barry
battles the villain of the week,
a criminal who can manipulate
the weather. This culminates
in a strong final battle where
Barry has to stop the villain
inside of a tornado; usually,
special effects on TV range
from poor to awful, but this one
is an exception to the rule.
However, a few poorly
placed scenes slow the pace.
The opening flashback
depicting Barry's life before his
mother's murder is full of poor
child acting and hokey parental
inspiration, both from stilted
writing. At one point, young
Barry laments that he wishes he
were faster; his mother imparts
this sugarcoated, rose-tinted
wisdom, "It's better to have a
good heart than fast legs."
Barry initially appeared on
"Arrow," so it seems natural for
"The Flash" to cross over with
its parent series. However, the
discussion between Barry and
Oliver Queen feels shoehorned
in. It probably works for fans
of "Arrow," but from a pacing
perspective, it slows down the
episode.
Thestrengthof"TheFlash"lies
in the optimism that comes with
superheroes. With many comic
book hero adaptations taking on
a darker tone (just look at FOX's
murky "Gotham"), its refreshing
to see a take on a superhero that
focuses more on the good rather
than the melancholy of heroism.

What Michigan hockey is supposed to be

At some point in the
middle of August, in
the weight room on the
second story of Yost Ice Arena,
the Michigan
hockey team
arrives to
practice.
Each
member
wears the
same gray
shirt with GREG

phrase on
the back,
"Day by day."
Captains say the practice
represents Day 35 of the summer
workouts - another long day
in a long week of a long, never-
ending season - and then they
start their morning with the
same intensity of a tie game.
Everyone finishes the lift,
heads to the ice through a locker
room, one with a complete
makeover from the last season.
Gone is the sign that said,
"Win the nextgame." It's been
replaced with key words such as
"Unity" and "Respect."
So they get dressed to hit the
ice and work out before they
return to the same locker room,
the one where Hobey Baker
winners Brendan Morrison
and Kevin

"For half of the team, they
don't even know that," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"We're obviously on a mission to
be abetter team than last year."
What Michigan needs isn't
a reminder about what it once
was, but rather an identity of
what it's going to be. It needs
to go through its process, "day
by day."
Last season's team had
"checked out" of a game or a
practice or a lifting session,
accordingto Copp.,This year's
team is focused on being "the
champions of each day."
"We're not the same 27 guys
that we were last year, or two
years ago," Copp said. "This is a
differentteam, with a different
attitude and a different makeup,
and we play a little different, too.
"Just because we haven't
made the tournament in the
last two years doesn't mean
we won't make it this year. It
doesn't mean we will make it
this year."
No, this is a team that fights
back, albeit in a 4-3 loss, even
after it goes down 3-0 against
Ferris State - a top-five team in
the country. It's one that doesn't
lose to the U.S. National Team's
Under-18 squad, which was the
case the last two years.
It's ateam that's even closer
than last year's team that had
barbecues, went to Red Wings
games together and played
paintball.
Thisis ateam that's treating
tomorrow's practice no different
than Friday's game.
This is ateam that wants
to win, because it wants to be
the champion of the day. Not
because it's supposed to.

*MICHIGAN'S WIN OVER PENN STATE

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA Gardner has his flaws
ManagingSports Editor as a quarterback, but he's
undoubtedly the leader of this

The Michigan football team
ended a three-game losing streak
Saturday with an 18-13 win over
Penn State.
The result keeps the
Wolverines in contention to
make a bowl game, but they must
win three of their remaining
five games to earn a spot in the
postseason.
Here are five things we learned
Saturday.
1. Devin Gardner is a warrior.
We all knew this one already.
Anyone who watched the
quarterback lead Michigan to a
near-upset of Ohio State with a
broken toe last year knew better
than to question his toughness.
Saturday was just another
example. After suffering a left-
foot injury during a quarterback
sneak in the third quarter, the
fifth-year senior hobbled to the
sideline. Later, he would leave
the stadium in a boot.
But before then, he limped
back onto the field for the fourth
quarter and led a crucial six-play
drive that ended with a go-ahead
field goal by senior Matt Wile.
The Wolverines never trailed
again. And when Michigan was
on defense, Gardner was one
of the team's most animated
supporters from the bench.

football team.
2. Defense can carry this team.
Before the season, defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison
expected his unit to be elite.
Against the Nittany Lions,
the Wolverines finally showed
glimpses of that potential.
Facing an admittedly poor
offensive line, Michigan's
front four hurried Penn
State quarterback Christian
Hackenberg and sacked him six
times. They held the Nittany
Lions to 54 net yards on the
ground. And they even forced an
interception.
The referees may have been
mistaken in calling offsides on
Penn State's onside kick late in
the fourth quarter. But given
Michigan's blanking of the
Nittany Lions in the second half,
did anyone really expect them
to march down the field for a
touchdown?
In seven second-half drives,
Penn State managed just 60 net
yards. If the Wolverines can
manage similar performances
this season, Michigan may just
turn things around.
3. Matt Wile has shaken off his
early jitters.

Wile didn't exactly have a
good start to the year, making
only one of his first four field goal
attempts. And on Oct. 4 against
Rutgers, he had the potential
game-winning field goal blocked.
The Wolverines needed him
to be perfect Saturday, and he
was. Wile made field goals of
45, 42 and 37 yards - the last
coming with 11:24 left to break a
13-13 tie - earning him Big Ten
Co-Special Teams Player of the
Week.
The senior is now 8-for-12 this
year and has knocked through all
of his extra points.
Areliablekicker canwingames,
and Wile showed he can be that
with his performance Saturday.
4. Amara Darboh is a solid No.
2 receiver.
Junior Devin Funchess is not
only Michigan's best receiver
but one of the best in the nation.
But given their struggles on the
ground, the Wolverines need
another downfield threat.
Say hello to Amara Darboh.
The redshirt sophomore
snagged four catches for 66
yards, making crucial receptions
in key situations. Each of his
grabs resulted in a Michigan
first down.
During the Wolverines' first
drive, Darboh made a leaping,
twisting grab and held on as he
crashed to the ground, picking

up 13 yards on 3rd-and-3. Three
plays later, Gardner found
Funchess for Michigan's only
touchdown of the night.
Sophomore Jehu Chesson is
out with an undisclosed injury,
so more solid outings by Darboh
could be crucial to the offense's
success.
Bold Prediction: Slippery
Rock will roll, and the
Michigan State game will be
close.
All of a sudden, Michigan has
a bye week to build off some
momentum. All of a sudden,
Michigan State looks vulnerable,
having been tested by Purdue,
and will face a high-powered
Indiana team Saturday.
The Spartans are the better
team, and they have the
advantage of playing at home
for a second year in a row. The
Wolverines haven't won in East
Lansing, Columbus or South
Bend under Michigan coach
Brady Hoke.
But next week's game has
been circled on Michigan's
calendar since last year's debacle.
And while Michigan State may
have the upper hand, don't be
surprised if it's close in the
fourth quarter.
Don't expect a close game
Saturday at the Big House,
though. The Rock should beat
Mercyhurst handily.

THE VISUAL STATEMENT: LANGAR AS AN ANCHOR FOR A COMMUNITY
BY LUNA ANNA ARCHEY

Diag.

he task is huge but don't have any anxi-
ety about it. We saw that at the temple.
Don't be stressed about it, come and
have fun. That is the purpose." That's what
Coordinator Prof. Jasprit Singh told the group
of students as they planned the logistics of
feeding 5,000 people.
'The direct translation of Langar is 'anchor',
and it's a tradition that started in the t5th cen-
tury to break the social barriers of the caste
system in India and bring together people of
all walks of life, and it still exists on a mas-
sive scale. A group of students in the Global
Intercultural Experience for Undergraduates
(GIEU) traveled to Amritsar, India this sum-
mer to see the impressive feat in action at the
Golden Temple, and to offer their own hard
work.
Later the same week I was able to attend
langar on a much smaller scale as the Sikh Stu-

dent Association got together for their monthly
prayer and langar. The students recited the
evening prayer "Rehraas Sahib" in a circle
together, then sang and played instruments in
praise during "keertan" before joining together
for a meal that they had prepared the night
before. The intimate occasion was joyful. Com-
munity member Amarjeet Kaur compared it to
my own Christian perceptions of "heaven," say-
ing they didn't believe in a heaven after death
because it is something you make yourself in
this life through relationships and instances of
community and togetherness.
For the GIEU students, the Sikh students,
and others that prepare food for langar, it is a
privilege to give their time to prepare food for
others, not spmething that is acknowledged or
expected. "Just as you would give to yourself
you give to your people because it is all con-
nected," Singh said.

Personal Statement: Confessions of a procrastinator
by Mark Ossolinski

the writer's notebook: writing as movement
BY CARLINA DUAN
Poetry is largely a practice of
holding myself accountable. For
me, poetry moves me
to action when I begin
naming my OWN joy and
my OWN fear. I do not
want others to-name it, or
me. I ask my students to
reconsider how the poem
reshapes or celebrates
or challenges a ques-
tion of the self. How
the poem creates a new
vision. Not every poem
has to be "deep," nor does
every poem have to have an
agenda behind it. But I believe
that poetry can create movement
and action when others begin to
seize their own languages, and
undertake the project of naming

being responsible for ourselves. It rattles the floors. It lifts us up.

How did I get here?"
It's a question I've
found myselfaskingmany
times before. Here again, late at
night, wondering just exactly how
it is that I am where I am. But this
isn't the late-night existential
ponderingofa person lying in bed,
staring at the ceiling and contem-
plating life's meaning;
nor am I David Byrne,
looking back at my3
life with freaked-out
regret - although there
is an element of both
the nocturnal and the
regretful in my ques-
tion.
Instead, I'm staring
at my computer screen _
and the blank word
document looking back
at me. It's some ungodly
hour in the middle of
the night. My second
coffee of the night-
now-turned-morning
is next to me - I guess
the purpose of the first
cup was just to get me
to start thinking about
writing this paper
that's due tomorrow.
The blinking black textt
cursor in the top left of
the sea of white seems
to be mocking me:
"When I'm blinking, that means
you're not writing!"
This is not a new experience for
me. I'm pissed about it.
"How did I get here ... again?"
The simple answer, of course, is
that I've procrastinated. In spite
of telling myself "Never again"
after my last all-nighter, and the
one before that and the one before
that, I've inevitably found myself
in the same situation all over
again.
Ah, procrastination: the bane
of many a student's existence. I've
been a serial procrastinator for a
long time, and even though I'm
aware of it and I hate it, I can't
seem to overcome it. How did I
become such a prolific dilly-dalli-
er in the first place? It's clear that
for me, the Internet is the main
culprit, and getting my own lap-
top for the first time in 10th grade
- along with the world of poten-
tial distractions it brought with it
- was a salient event on the path
to my current condition of com-

puter-induced pseudo-ADD.
As I think about all of this, still
sitting in an empty library, my
paper hardly started, with harsh
fluorescent lights serving as the
only reminder that I might not be
the only person up at this hour,
I naturally decide it's time for a
break. All that staring at a blank

nation of the Digital Age that calls
for us to return to ye (g)olden
days when people wrote letters,
read, had greater attention spans
and actually talked to each other,
by goodness! While I do some-
times wish for those "simpler"
times with their fewer distrac-
tions and stimuli, that argument

and I devote myself fully to my
work - once I actually get around
to it, that is. Another weird thing
is that as unhealthy as my habits
are, they've always worked. My
procrastination may cause me
more stress and sleep deprivation
than I'd like, but I always finish
my work. Set a deadline for me

while. I know that if I didn't pro-
crastinate so much, I'd be able to
do more of these things. Yet
mental block has lingered, and
I haven't been able to figure out
how to fix it. Until recently.
Several months ago, during
one of my wonderful procrasti-
natory frolics across the Inter-
net, as it happens, I came across
something that may have finally
given me the impetus I needed.
A quote from Gustave Flaubert,
a writer I know next to nothing
about, but who I'd like to think,
I'd be more familiar with
weren't always wasting my time
in front of a screen:
"Be regular and orderly in your
life, so that you may be violent
and original in your work."
The combination of a desire
for discipline but also excite-
ment and creativity seemed to
intertwine perfectly with my
own frustrations. I've often
looked down upon the idea of a
perfectly ordered life, consider-
ing it artificial and unfulfilling,
and I think that mentality *.<
tributed to my habit of putting
off work. I thought a "regular"
life and an exciting one were
mutually exclusive, but that's
not the case. I can have both.
It's the old mantra: Do what you
have to do now so you can do
what you want to do later.
That may seem like an obvious
lesson to most, but it's one that
took me years to fully embrace.
And my new mindset is already
paying dividends. Every time
I have the urge to check Face-
book when I should be working, I
think of this quote. Every time I
think "I can just start this later,"
I think of this quote. And as I fin-
ish this piece of writing with a
(decent amount of) time before
my deadline, with the insanity of
midterms behind me and a free
weekend ahead of me, I really
think Flaubert might've been on
to something. So if you're some-
one who has grappled with the
same affliction that I have,
sider this message. Focus on the
things you need to do now so you
can do violent and original things
with the time you save. Go read a
book. Go build something. Write a
screenplay. Throw your compute
in the trash. Okay, maybe not t a
violent, but you get my point.

screen is tough work. I decide to
look up the root of the word "pro-
crastinate." From the Latin pro-
crastinatus, from pro: forward +
cras: tomorrow. I contemplate this
for a while before realizing, "Hey,
it is tomorrow. Yes, that same
tomorrow that this paper is due!"
Frustration wells up within me,
because this is probably the 30th
time tonight that I've let myself
go down one of these Internet-
enabled tangents.
I want to throw my computer
away. I really do. I frequently
envision myself during these
moments getting up from my
desk, picking up my precious lap-
top and chucking it at the near-
est trashcan. Or maybe just at the
wall. But this fantasy obviously
isn't plausible, nor would it solve
anything. Like many students, I
need my computer for basically all
of my schoolwork. So I sigh, and I
do my best to refocus and get back
to work.
Now, this isn't the old condem-

is narrow-minded and gives
no credit to the incredible ways in
which technology has improved
our lives. I just know that I'm
more susceptible to the diversions
offered by the Internet than other
people are. My laptop is a portal
to an entire world of things that
can distract me, from Facebook
to YouTube to fantasy sports. Yes,
there's the SelfControl app, but
even that has its loopholes, and
there's always your handy smart-
phone with 3G or 4G. To all of you
who are able to sit down in front
of a computer, block everything
out, and finish an assignment
days before the deadline: I envy
you. And I'm trying to get on your
level.
My struggle with procrasti-
nation is clearly a struggle to be
more disciplined, to practice more
SelfControl. The weird thing is
that in many other ways, I am dis-
ciplined. In spite of my bad habit
of doing homework at the last
minute, I'm a dedicated student

and I'll meet it. So what real rea-
son have I had to change my ways,
other than the constant thought
of "Eventually I'll have to"? This
way of doing things probably
won't work in the real world after
college, but do I really need to fix
them this instant?
The answer, though, is an
unequivocal Yes. Pulling all-
nighters is obviously unhealthy.
But just as important to me is
the fact that my biggest source of
frustration throughout my years
of beinga procrastinator has been
the sheer amount of time I've
wasted doing utterly inane shit on
my computer. I want to be more
productive with my time. I'm an
English major, but I haven't read
nearly as many books as I'd like. I

becoming a screenwriter, but my

Curtain call: Life after theatre school
by Paige Pfleger

The world of theatre
is cutthroat. Being
talented isn't always
enough to land a role in the
ipetitive world of profes-
sional performance. Actors
need to look, dress, act and be
the part of the character they're
pretending to be. A whole slew
of factors can throw a wrench
into the best laid plans, espe-
cially when hundreds of people
are competing for the same
role.
The same goes for making it
into theatre school - especial-
ly at the University. Competi-
4AiQ doesn't end once students
are accepted. Throughout the
course of their careers in the
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, actors audition for hun-
dreds of plays, musicals and
movies. A lot of time, they don't
get cast, but that rejection is all
a part of a learning process.
The culture of theatre school is a lot
like the harsh realities that face actors and
actresses after graduation. But does that
mean that actors and actresses are ready
to face professional challenges by the time
'r-Ouation rolls around?
For actress Jacqueline Toboni, the answer
was a resounding yes.
It was Winter 2014 when Toboni hit her
big break. She had been cast in the Screen
Arts & Cultures 423 film, "Bad Girls," and
Grimm Executive Producer Jim Kouf paid
a visit to the class. He was impressed with
some of the actresses in the film and had
them do a practice audition for a role in the
show, Trubel. Kouf was so taken with Tobo-
ni that he cast her in the role.
Tobani's training at SMTD gave her he
skills to snag the acting opportunity, while
still graduating on time in May 2014.
Currently, she's filming in Portland.
"Not every school would let me do that,"
Toboni said. "I think Michigan is really good
at seeing the bigger picture. They're good at
saying, 'Listen, we're teaching you all of this
stuff, in order for you to get work.' And as an
actor, that's really hard. So when that oppor-
tunity presented itself they encouraged
me to take advantage of that. I think that's
something that is very special, and I don't
know what I would have done if I didn't do
that."
'1 hat's one of the overwhelmingly posi-
tive things about SMTD - through their
coursework and academic opportunities,
the school has been trying to teach their
actors the skills for them to succeed, and if
they find that success earlier than expected,
students are allowed to chase after it.
Music, Theatre & Dance alum CJ Eldred,
a musical theatre major, had a similar expe-

rience to Toboni. He was cast as the stand-
by-for-lead in the first national tour of "Book
of Mormon" the semester before he was sup-
posed to graduate.
"Michigan gave me all of the tools, and all
of the opportunities to really start my career
strong," Eldred said.
But not everyone in the theatre and musi-
cal theatre programs had the same experi-
ences as Toboni and Eldred. Other than
talent, Eldred admitted that something else
comes into play as well - luck.
"I was lucky compared to other people in
my class that I had this fortunate opportu-
nity that there was a show that suited me so
well, and that I also had producers that were
trusting that a kid who hadn't even gradu-
ated college yet could jump in and play the
role," he explained. "I definitely think that
there's the same opportunities for people,
and it's just as possible for anyone in my
class to have had the same thing happen to
them."
Music Theatre & Dance senior Adam
Quinn, specializing in directing within the
theatre performance program, was given the
opportunity to leave and assume a associate
director role in a show during Winter 2014
at 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, and is cur-
rently directing at Goodspeed Opera House
in East Haddam, Conn., widely known as the
home of the American musical.
Even though SMTD let him leave to pur-
sue these opportunities, Quinn didn't feel
as if he was encouraged or appreciated for
doing so. Instead he felt quite the opposite.
"I found that many times, I am looked
at negatively by some people in the depart-
ment," he said. "Not only faculty, but also
students, and the way they think it's sup-
posed to be run versus what is going to give

me the best education possible."
Quinn said he is often times disappointed
in that way that faculty members at SMTD
respond to non-SMTD theatre produc-
tions, like the musical group MUSKET, or
independent Basement Arts that often offer
opportunities to students in and outside of
SMTD.
"The faculty sometimes looks down
on things like MUSKET and Basement
Arts, and I think that's really negative," he
explained. "It's allowing students to become
better. No, they're not being directed by fac-
ulty but sometimes, students can really learn
from other students."
Despite the pushback that he received
when trying to take time off, Quinn admits
that he really couldn't have gotten the same
quality of education at any other school. For
that reason, he says the University's pro-
gram is really unmatched.
"I would not be where I am today," Quinn
said, "and as prepared as I am today to go into
the professional world, than if I didn't go to
school at Michigan and learn from these fac-
ulty members and take these courses and be
given these opportunities," he said.
Music Theatre & Dance senior Teagan
Rose, specializing in acting within the the-
atre performance program, knew Michi-
gan's acting program was the place for her
from the moment she visited campus.
"Michigan was actually the very last place
that I auditioned for, and the last place I vis-
ited, and it was the only place when I came
here, as cliche as it sounds, I had the moment
- the 'this is my school' moment, the feel-
ing in my gut that this is the place that I'm
supposed to be," she said. "It was the faculty,
and the auditions and the campus."
Part of what intrigued Rose the most

about SMTD was the com-
petitive nature and the con-
stant challenges that the
actors face. Difficult shows,
classes, auditions and roles
keep the students constant-
ly on their toes, and, as a
result, constantly improving
and striving to be better.
"I never want to settle on
what I have, I always strive
to be better because I know
I always can be better. So I
find being in a department
where everybody is so tal-
ented, and it is very com-
petitive and the caliber is so
high, it's actually even more
encouraging because it just
makes sure that everybody
is on their A-game."
Rose is looking forward
to a semester full of shows,
including playing the lead
role in the play "Fuenteove-
juna," which centers on
themes of female empowerment. Life after
graduation is still up in the air, but she hopes
to move to California to start her career act-
ing for film or stage.
Even though Music Theatre & Dance
alum Al Fallick made it into the school of
musical theater, which is the most competi-
tive program at SMTD, he isn't doing musi-
cal theatre in his post-grad life. Instead, he's
moved to L.A. to pursue a career in comedy.
"I feel like musical theatre and comedy
are very closely tied," he said. "Some of the

cal theatre and some of the same things that
help you succeed in comedy: high emotions,
big characters, you know?"
Because there isn't really a graduate
school for comedians, Fallick is taking class-
es at The Groundlings, an improv and sketch
comedy school that has cranked out comedi-
ans like Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy.
While he's taking classes, he is supporting
himself through a job at Starbucks.
"The big negative, I think, is getting seen
for job interviews that don't have to do with
the industry, when my resume says I am a
musical theatre major."
Unlike Fallick, many of the musical the-
atre majors end up in New York City, audi-
tioning for Broadway productions. Acting
majors are more divided, with some pur-
suing stage plays in New York and others
trying to land roles in TV or movies, like
Toboni.
The upcoming class of graduates will
wind up spread across the country, or even
the nation, trying to use their Michigan edu-
cation to their advantage while auditioning
for shows.
Maybe they'll hit it big. Not all of them do,
but it's like they say - that's show biz, kid.

K sharp rise of intonation followed by an
inquisitive eyebrow - "Oh, so you're
joring in film?"
Well, not exactly.
Here at the University, it's Screen Arts & Cul-
tures, which isn't the same as majoring in film.
That medium is dead. You'd be hard pressed
to find a kid reeling film stock or splicing and
mendingtogether single frames from a filmstrip.
But screen arts? It's a combination of practice
and theory, and it's a field thatis very much alive.
Screen art is the modern alternative to film
- the dynamic digital imagery that pops up on
your laptop screen, flashes on the television and
glues you to your smartphone. It's not just the
study of how to make films, but the study of the
culture of making them.
But with big film schools like New York Uni-
versity or the University of Southern California
leading the pack, how does Michigan stack up?
What does a SAC degree mean for a life post-
graduation? With an interdisciplinary take on
film education, students at the University are
taking advantage of a more diverse set of post-
grad endeavors. Such careers may apply to film,
butit's certainlynot a set-in-stone requirement.
"Do you know what film is anymore?" Terri
Sarris, associate chair of the Department, asked.
"It's the stuff with the holes - celluloid." No one
at the University is a'film' major.
Instead, the SAC department, in line with all
other LSA majors, prides itself on the diverse
education it offers, comprised of both theory
and practice courses.
"We think of it, on one hand, like any other
major in that college," Sarris said. "Anybody
who has a degree from LSA finds creative ways
to use that degree."
Two-thirds ofthe department's curriculum is
based on the study of theory and history, while
the other third includes hands-on production
experience.
The Screen Arts & Cultures Department is

THE U
new to
the University. Before administrators were con-
vinced that students could pursue viable careers
in media studies, the Department was classified
as the Film and Video Studies Program.
Under Gaylyn Studlar, who served as director
of LSA's Film and Video Program from 1995 to
2005, it was transformed into the Screen Arts &
Cultures Department,giving it the power to hire
its ownprofessors and to expand its curriculum.
"The idea of [the program] being screen arts
and the culture around that seem to more accu-
rately reflectwhat the department had become,"
Sarris added.
Phil Ranta, a LSA alum, focused on screen-
writing when it was still the Film and Video
Program. The transition was finalized in 2005,
the year he graduated - a year when MySpace
was hugely popular and YouTube had just pre-
miered online.
"So it was really the beginning of a revolu-
tion," Ranta said. "U of M recognized the shift
at the right time."
After graduation, Ranta became a pioneer
in shaping film's place in an online platform.
Initially, he sold his screenplay for a TV pilot,
which was shot in Ann Arbor during his senior
year, to Turner's comedy web outlet called
SuperDeluxe.com. He stressed the importance
of knowing how to write and tell a story, regard-
less ofcareer plans. In this sense, his degree was
applicable far beyond the world of film.
"The beautiful thing about focusing on
screenwriting is that everything is storytelling
- independent of the medium," Ranta said.
Ranta later became the Head of Channel
Partnershipswith Fullscreen - YouTube's larg-
est network of content creators and brands that
strive to"empower thenextgenerationofartists
and creators." As their ninth employee at the
time, Ranta said he played a role in shaping the

goals of the now multimillion-dollar company.
The Department's fusion of production,
screenwriting, history and theory courses into
its curriculum is a unique concept that sets it
apart from the more traditional film schools.
Other universities are beginning to catch on
and recognize the value in a more liberal arts
style film school education. After leaving in
2009, Studlar, who built up the SAC program at
the University, joined Washington University in
St. Louis and presently serves there as the direc-
tor of its own Film and Media Studies Program.
Studlar pushed to incorporate a similar ratio of
theory and practice courses in St. Louis.
Screen Arts lecturer Mark Kligerman has
taught a variety of study-based courses at the
University for over 10 years. Courses he has
recently instructed include upper level Con-
temporary Film Theory; Cult, Camp Art and
Exploitation; and The Animated Film, aswell as
various film history courses.
Kligerman said that although students are
being primed for a career in film production
- what most would associate with the "Holly-
wood" career path - they also develop writing
and critical skills by studying theory and his-
tory, which prepares them to go into any field,
related orunrelated to film itself.
He said he has seen students graduate and
begin endeavors in the fields of journalism, law
and even medicine. Regardless of where stu-
dents decide to take their major, career-wise,
Kligerman stressed the importance ofbecoming
informed producers and consumers of media
culture. The intention of raising profound his-
torical awareness of media culture itself is
inherent in the name of the major - Screen Arts
& Cultures.

"It's one thing to bring in very successful
graduates who are further along in their careers
but those people can seem fairly remote so I

dents who have just graduated," Sarris added.
Sarris mentioned one University graduate
who is getting in touch with more eccentric
opportunities. One student is travelling with
Ann Arbor musician Mr. B, documenting his
ride down the Mississippi bank pulling a piano
behind him.
Inevitably, during production classes, SAC
majors will carry camera equipment around
the city of Ann Arbor. In this sense, Ann Arbor
serves as a springboard for on-site filming,
regardless of where students decide to apply
the skills learned. Aside from campus, the city
of Ann Arbor is much friendlier to SAC students
than large cities, such as New York, which costs
minimum $300 for a permit to film.
Sarris said Ann Arbor, as a smaller town, is
not so steeped in the film industry, so people are
lenient with lettingstudents shoot.
