A small fire was reported in
the Art and Architecture Build-
ing on North Campus Wednes-
day evening.
Flames were seen comingfrom

the building's sculpture studios
by multiple witnesses. Sources
at the scene said multiple Huron
Valley Ambulances, Ann Arbor
Fire Department Fire Engines
and University Police vehicles
were located outside the building
to evacuate students, faculty and
staff and suppress the fire.
AAFD Battalion Chief Rob-
ert Vogel confirmed that the fire
originated from a pottery kiln
inside the sculpture studio. He
said the first firefighters on the
scene were from Station5, which
is located near the Northwood
Apartments on Beal Road near
North Campus. He said no inju-

ries were reported as a result of
the fire.
Vogel said that the walls of the
sculpture room and surround-
ing equipment were damaged
by the flames, but the building
itself is safe. Shortly after the
fire was extinguished, students
were allowed to return to work
in other areas of the building.
Vogel said the burned kiln
was full of student pieces. It's
not clear what projects, if any,
survived the flames. Witnesses
estimated that flames inside
the studio were about eight feet
high.
He added that evacuation of

students, faculty and staff was
quick and efficient, and a fire
marshal will now inspect the
room to estimate damage and
determine if the studio is safe
for occupancy.
The University's Emergency
Alert System was activated at
about 7:00 p.m., advising recipi-
ents to stay away from the build-
ing. University Police reported
that the fire was extinguished at
about 7:04 p.m, and there were
no injuries.
Fire alarms inside the build-
ing were still activated and fire-
fighters remained on the roof of
the building as of about 7:15 p.m.

ZBT officials from the Uni-

Obama: 'I'll do whatever it

hint at concessions
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House and a key congres-
sional Democrat hinted at fresh
concessions on taxes and cuts to
Medicare and other government
benefit programs Wednesday as
bargaining with Republicans
lurched ahead to avoid the year-
end "fiscal cliff" that threatens

to send the economy into a tail-
spin.
Increasing numbers of rank-
and-file Republicans also said
they were ready to give ground,
a boost for House Speaker John
Boehner and other party lead-
ers who say they will agree to
higher tax revenues as part of a
deal if it also curbs benefit pro-
grams as a way to rein in federal
deficits.
"I'll go anywhere and I'll do
whatever it takes to get this
done," President Barack Obama

said as he sought to build pres-
sure on Republicans to accept
his terms - a swift renewal of
expiring tax cuts for all but the
highest income earners. "It's
too important for Washington
to screw this up," he declared.
For all the talk, there was no
sign of tangible progress on an
issue that marks a first test for
divided government since elec-
tions that assured Obama a sec-
ond term in the White House
while renewing Republican
control in the House.
"It's time for the president
and Democrats to get serious
about the spending problem
that our country has," Boehner
said at a news conference in
the Capitol. He, like Obama,
expressed optimism that a deal
could be reached.
At the same time, he publicly
disagreed with one GOP law-
maker, Rep. Tom Cole of Okla-
homa; who said he was ready
to go along with Obama's plan
to renew most but not all of the
expiring income tax cuts. "It'll
hurt the economy" to raise rates
for anyone, said Boehner.
Separately, at a closed-door
meeting with the rank and file,
the speaker told fellow Repub-
licans they are on solid politi-
cal ground in refusing to let tax
rates rise. He circulated polling
data showing the public favors
closing loopholes to raise rev-
enue far more than it supports
raising rates on incomes over
$250,000.
There were no face-to-face
talks between the administra-
tion and lawmakers during the
day, although the White House
is dispatching Treasury Sec-
retary Tim Geithner and top
legislative aide Rob Nabors to a
series of sessions with congres-
sional leaders on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a group of
corporate CEOs pushing for a
deal met separately with top

Erskine Bowles, who was co-

Protesters storm an office of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood Freedom and Justice party and
set fires in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, Egypt, Friday, Nov. 23, 2012.
Egypt crisis raises fears
of 'second revolution'

Draft of new
constitution
expected this week
CAIRO (AP) - Faced with
an unprecedented strike by the
courts and massive opposition
protests, Egypt's Islamist presi-
dent is not backing down in the
showdown over decrees granting
him near-absolute powers.
Activists warn that his actions
threaten a "second revolution,"
but Mohammed Morsi faces a
different situation than his oust-
ed predecessor, Hosni Mubarak:
He was democratically elected
and enjoys the support of the
nation's most powerful political
movement.
Already, Morsi is rushing the
work of an Islamist-dominated
constitutional assembly at the
heart of the power struggle, with
a draft of the charter expected
as early as Thursday, despite a
walkout by liberal and Christian
members that has raised ques-
tions about the panel's legiti-
macy.
The next step would be for
Morsi to call a nationwide ref-

erendum on the document. If
adopted, parliamentary elec-
tions would be held by the
spring.
Wednesday brought a last-
minute scramble to seize the
momentum over Egypt's politi-
cal transition. Morsi's camp
announced that his Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamists
will stage a massive rally in
Cairo's Tahrir Square, the plaza
where more than 200,000 oppo-
sition supporters gathered a day
earlier.
The Islamists' choice of the
square for Saturday's rally raises
the possibility of clashes. Several
hundred Morsi opponents are
camped out there, and another
group is fighting the police on a
nearby street.
"It is tantamount to a dec-
laration of war," said liberal
politician Mustafa al-Naggar,
speaking on the private Al-Tah-
rir TV station.
Morsi remains adamant that
his decrees, which place him
above oversight of any kind,
including by the courts, are in
the interest of the nation's transi-
tion to democratic rule.
Backing down may not be an

option for the 60-year-old U.S.-
educated engineer.
Doing so would significantly
weaken him and the Brother-
hood at a time when their image
has been battered by widespread
charges that they are too preoc-
cupied with tightening their grip
onpower to effectivelytackle the
country's many pressing prob-
lems.
Morsi's pride is also a key
factor in a country where most
people look to their leader as an
invincible figure.
He may not be ready to stom-
ach another public humilia-
tion after backing down twice
since taking office in June. His
attempt to reinstate parliament's
Islamist-dominated lower cham-
ber after it was disbanded in July
by the Supreme Constitutional
Court was overturned by that
same court. Last month, Morsi
was forced to reinstate the coun-
try's top prosecutor just days
after firing him when the judi-
ciary ruled it was not within his
powers to do so.
Among Morsi's first acts after
seizing near-absolute powers last
week was to fire the prosecutor
again.

An area of Arctic sea ice big-

climate change is happening
"before our eyes."
In a report released at U.N. cli-

ice melt was one of a myriad of
extreme and record-breaking
weather events to hit the planet
in 2012. Droughts devastated
nearly two-thirds of the United
States as well western Russia
and southern Europe. Floods
swamped west Africa and heat

But it was the ice melt that
seemed to dominate the annual

Grants aimed
to promote
collaboration
By MICHELE GILLINGHAM
For the Daily
At 10 a.m. Wednesday, the
Twitter account of the Universi-
ty's Office of the Vice President
for Research started lighting up
with new tweets.
"Emergence of locally-
owned food business in Detroit
#mcubed," read one tweet,
accompanied by a link.
"Adaptive health commu-
nications over mobile devices
#mcubed," read another.
The tweets, totaling 50 over,
the course of 51 minutes, were
announcements of choices for
the MCubed program, a $15-mil-
lion initiative started in May as
part of the University's Third
Century initiative to encourage
interdisciplinary research.
Wednesday's announcements
represented the first set of 50
research projects to receive
seed grants and each selected
project will receive $60,000 in
grants. Among chosen research
topics include the genetics of
tooth defects, an examination
of post-industrial cities, carbon
capture and hydraulic fractur-
ing. The research approved in
this round of projects is expect-
ed to be completed by June 2014.
, The contest for grants was

competitive, as faculty rushed to
apply for funding after hearing
of the program. Mark Burns, the
chair of the department of chem-
ical engineering - along with
Alec Gallimore and Thomas Zur-
buchen, the founders of MCubed
and associate deans in the Col-
lege of Engineering - selected
applicants through a semi-ran-
domly pick in order to make the
process fair, Zurbuchen told the
Daily in October.
Faculty applicants had to
partner with at least two other
researchers to form a "cube,"
and at least two members of a
prospective cube had to be from
different departments.
Susan urphy, a professor of
statistics, explained that she had
to compose a research and men-
toring plan, as well as determine
a budget.
Ben Allen, an assistant pro-
fessor of cell and developmental
biology, had his cube approved
by MCubed. Allen will study
the effects of cancer drugs that
inhibit Hedgehog signaling, a
nuanced type of signaling deal-
ing with taste and smell. He said
he is looking forward to having
the opportunity to be part of the
program.
"Fortunately, at UM, there are
experts in Hedgehog signaling
(both basic scientists and clini-
cians), taste and smell," Allen
said. "MCubed provided a per-
fect opportunity for these scien-
tists to collaborate in the pursuit
of answers to this question."

film clip filled the projection
screen in Rackham Auditorium
as a grainy promotional televi-
sion segment - produced by
a U.S. government agency to
encourage adoption - depicted
happy parents selecting chil-
dren from orphanages.
The piece served as an intro-
duction to an address by Cate-
' lynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra,
the stars of MTV's reality show
"Teen Mom," on adoption, a
practice they said was a far cry
from the antiquated images of
the past. Hundreds of students
attended the event -sponsored
by Bethany Christian Services, a
family-planning center, and the
University's chapter of Students
for Life - that was designed to
examine adoption and provide
students with a chance to brush
shoulders with well-known
reality stars.
.The two guests, now age
20, who are from Marine City,
Mich., appeared with their
Bethany Christian Services
adviser, to show clips from the
MTV series and share their
story in a question and answer
format. ,
When Bethany approached
Students for Life about hosting
the event, club president Tori
Criswell said it was a perfect
opportunity.
"We're all about fostering a
culture of life," Criswell said.
"We're a pro-life group, but we
really want to encourage dia-
logue. This is a great way to do
thatbecause Catelynn and Tyler
are really candid about their
experiences and that this stuff
gets people talking. They have a
very positive story and we want
to share life and the beauty of
that and how really good things
can come out of a seemingly
scary situation."
Criswell said Students for
Life hopes. its campus efforts,
including Wednesday's event,
will raise awareness and pro-
vide support for students coping

with unexpected pregnancy. In
addition to hosting speakers,
the group provides confidential
support through a Pregnant on
Campus Initiative and walks in
the March for Life each year.
That story began before
Lowell found out she was preg-
nant at age 16. Baltierra said he
remembers passing notes to
Lowell in seventh grade music
class, hoping to convince her
to go out with him, and they've
been together ever since.
After receiving news about
the baby, the couple struggled
to decide between raising the
child and completing an adop-
tion. Since both teens resided in
unstable home settings - Low-
ell's mother was an alcoholic
and a drug user and Baltierra's
dad shuffled in and out of prison
- ultimately, the two opted for
an open adoption.
Lowell and Baltierra careful-
ly selected the adoptive family,
and in their open adoption they
stay in contact with the family
and their child. They communi-
cate with their daughter, Carly,
regularly.
Lowell said she has no
regrets about deciding on adop-
tion. Both had unfulfilled goals
to meet, like graduating high
school, and they both plan
to enroll in college to pursue
degrees in social work.
Still, they said the decision
wasn't easy, and Baltierra said
he admires the courage Lowell
had in tackling the situation.
"I think for someone to have
that strength to be able to sacri-
fice like that for the child, to see
her strength through the whole
situation, really inspired me,"
Baltierra said.
Manyofthe event's attendees
also gleaned inspiration from
listening to the couple's experi-
ences. .
"I watched their story on
'Teen Mom' and always thought
the story was special," Engi-
neering sophomore Carly
Chorba said. "Not a lot of people
would have the courage to give
up the baby for adoption."
However, some students said
they mostly attended the event
to see their favorite reality tele-
vision stars.
LSA freshman Olivia Robert-
son said she didn't necessarily
agree with the pro-life spon-
sors, but still welcomed the
chance to attend the event.

"I think it's an interesting
opportunity to see people from
a TV show," Robertson said.
Regardless of reasons for
attending, Lowell said she is
glad to help educate others who
attended the event.
"It's crazy because I'll get
girls who said they made an
adoption plan from hearing my
story," she said.
Though Lowell and Baltierra
aren't planning on having more
children anytime soon, they
plan to get married next year
at a Renaissance themed wed-
ding. After nine years, Baltierra
said their relationship is stron-
ger than ever.
"I think trauma either does
one of two things to a relation-
ship. It either brings things
closer or rips them apart," he

Improvingeducation
Reform is needed in Michigan's public schools
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder is expected to present the
details of an important new education bill for the state of
Michigan in February. The proposed education reform bill,
which was recently obtained by the Detroit Free Press, would sub-
stantially change the public education system in the state of Michi-
gan. While reforming Michigan education should be discussed, this
bill could change the entire ideology of our educational system by
implementing unnecessarily extreme changes.

Getting your MRS and BME degrees

hile dinner tables across
America were still warm
from the turkey and fix-
ings last Thurs-
day night, mine
was just heat-
ing up with a
new source of
warmth: con-
versation. Ideas
were being
argued, sto-
ries were being HEMA
shared, conclu- KARUNA-
sions were being KARAM
drawn. But the
topic at hand
was one that only rarely had made it
to the dinner table or, for that matter,
was even spoken aloud in my family:
relationships and marriage.'
With many of the daughters of
family friends hitting their mid-
20s and looking toward marriage,
combined with the realization that
my mother was engaged by my age,
it shouldn't have surprised me that
a taboo topic a few years ago in my
family was now being openly dis-
cussed. Growing up in America in
a fairly traditional Indian house-
hold, I never expected my parents
to condone any type of romantic
relationship in my life. But I guess
their recently revealed open-mind-
edness was understandable. After
all, where else but in college would
I ever encounter so many potential
future grooms?
A widely circulated column that
ran this past summer in the Univer-
sity of Georgia's student paper, The
Red & Black, satirized the concept
of women, particularly at Southern
schools, whose goal is to graduate
with an "MRS degree"- that is,
a ring on their finger and nothing

more. The column received wide-
spread criticism for the sensitive
nature of the topic and the "satire"
being perhaps not satirical enough.
The columnist subsequently issued
a statement explaining her inten-
tions and affirming her belief that
many women now, including herself,
are very ambitious and are certainly
not in college for the sole purpose of
finding a husband. However, much
of the attention the columnreceived
undoubtedly stemmed from the
truth underlying the satire.
Apart from being a source of
higher education, for many people
college also serves as a goldmine of
intelligent, like-minded people who
happen to also be in their physical
prime.'There's no doubt that a large
percentage of Americans meet their
future spouses or companions in
college, and while the MRS degree
may be a frowned-upon concept,
the reasons for women histori-
cally choosing this route are, quite
honestly, logical. Of course, many
women now expect much more out
of college than a ring on their fin-
ger or evena boyfriend, but perhaps
a shift in priorities has also led to
more disregard for the non-aca-
demic opportunities college offers.
There's nothing wrong with
graduating with a 4.0 in fashion
merchandise and high hopes for a
proposal from your Harvard Uni-
versity Law boyfriend. But maybe
the Elle Woods types are best left
to the fictional world of "Legally
Blonde." More commonly today,
especially at top tier schools, we
see highly motivated and career-
oriented women - graduating per-
haps without 4.0s, but with offers
from companies like Apple or Gold-
man Sachs. Some may exit with a

serious relationship as well, but
this isn't high on the priority list
for many of them.
I'll admit it: I've been single for
five semesters of college and as far
as I know, it may stay that way for
my remaining three. I have big plans
for my future to further my educa-
tion and develop myself profession-
ally. I certainly didn't come here for
an MRS degree. But I think the tint
on the lens through which I view
Elle Woods had a
few things right
about college.

Among other provisions, the bill would
provide scholarships of $2,500 per semester,
of up to $10,000, to students who finish high
school early, and would "provide a framework
for funding based on performance, once the
proper assessment and testing mechanisms
are in place," the Free Press reported. The
bill also removes district ownership of stu-
dents, allowing students to choose in which
district they enroll. Funding provided to stu-
dents will then follow the students to the dis-
trict they transfer to - potentially splitting
a student's funding among multiple districts.
We shouldn't be encouraging high school
students to graduate early. Many students
whograduate earlymaynotbe matureenough
to move into a college environment. Attend-
ing high school for four years is important for
students because they have time to develop
their social skills and ability to interact with
peers and teachers, which will benefit them
in both casual and professional social situa-
tions later in life. Extracurricular activities
in high school help to develop skills such as
teamwork and cooperation that cannot be
taught in the classroom and make students
more well-rounded individuals. If students

focus exclusively on schoolwork and rush to
graduate, they may miss out on many of these
valuable opportunities. Education isn't just
about grades, its about growth.
Funding based on performance is also
very problematic for disadvantaged students.
Schools in lower-income areas are likely to
perform differently than students in liigher-
income areas. The current bill doesn't com-
pensate for this disparity. Public education
is supposed to provide the best education for
everybody. Performance-based funding isn't
the way to fund public education.
Unlike a voucher system, public educa-
tion is intended to benefit everyone. Pub-
lic education is paid through taxes, much
more effective than the voucher system. By
turning Michigan's education system into
a voucher system, some students will have
more opportunities than others, leaving
some students worse off. This system based
in inequality is the wrong way to fix Michi-
gan's education system.
We need to find ways to improve Michi-
gan's educational system, but the proposed
bill does more harm than good for Michi-
gan's students.

college has been lifted just slightly.
Will I go out of my way now to
look for a husband? Absolutely not.
But will I welcome the possibility
of allowing serious relationships
as I might allow for other extra-
curricular activities? Starting this
week, perhaps.
None of us are here in college just
to snag that future spouse or com-
panion. But there's no denying that
this opportunity likely won't pres-
ent itself again. There's no need to
skip class or lose sleep over it. But
go ahead and put your best foot
forward. Go to that party, text that
person back. Sure, they might just
be a college fling. But they could
always turn out to be much more.

Why Lincoln would los

Being told that you have noth-
ing more than a common cold after
waiting in line at University Health
Services for three hours to treat an
eight-week-long illness would make
any student a bit disgruntled. This
happened to my best friend this fall.
Her sickness for several months and
eventual retreat home to receive
proper medical attention at her local
family physician drew my atten-
tion to the pressing administra-
tive issues in our University Health
System. Though we're entitled to
"free"- read: included in our tuition
charges - health care as University
students, it seems we're paying an
untold price. The health program
has turned into a bureaucracy where
nurses can give students a "code" to
bypass the system while others wait
helplessly with a fever for hours,
only to be told they cannot see a doc-
tor for a week. With one of the best
medical programs in the world, the
University should be doing more for
its students and faculty.
It all started when my friend first
got sick in September. Her illness
progressed to night sweats, fevers
and a horrible cough, so she ventured
her first trip to UHS. She waited
for several hours and was eventu-
ally prescribed antibiotics, but they
didn'thelp. As the weather got colder,
she got sicker and sickeruntil itgotso
bad she could barely walk without
feeling her head pound and couldn't
sleep at night without waking up in a
cold, feverish sweat.
Naturally, it was hard to main-
tain her schoolwork and demand-
ing schedule, so she returned to

UHS. Upon arrival, they immedi-
ately sent her to wait for two hours.
Then, despite the fact that her record
showed a return visit for worsening
symptoms, she was sent to a desk
to schedule an appointment with a
doctor. They scheduled her for a few
days later. When she went in for her
appointment, the doctors looked at
her chart, looked in her eyes, nose
and throat, and handed her a pam-
phlet on the common cold.
Asa last resort to stop the deterio-
ration of her health, my friend help-
lessly traveled home to see her own
doctor, knowing she couldn't just,
have a common cold. Her home prac-
titioner diagnosed her with a severe
sinus infection. She was prescribed
the proper medications before she
returned to campus. Though she was
grateful to be on the mend, she was
behind on her work as a result of the
hours spent waiting in UHS and the
subsequent trip home. This anecdote
exemplifies our University's failing
health system.
With the new triage system enact-
ed in this fall, students who walk in
seeking medical care first have to
wait to be scheduled for an appoint-
ment based on the severity of their
illness. There are virtually no more
walk-ins welcome. While in theory,
the scheduling makes sense and does
help separate those who need less-
urgent STI tests from those who are
bed-ridden with severe illnesses,
it's not working. Students who are
in desperate need for medical atten-
tion are not receiving help quickly
enough. It seems that the system
determining the severity of the ill-

ness and the subsequent urgency for
care, is at fault.
It's not enough to look at a stu-
dent and say, "You don't have a fever
this moment and you're not violently
throwing up, so come back in a week
for your appointment," as opposed to
another student with a skin infection
(like another with whom I've spo-
ken) who gets fast-tracked to a doctor
without much wait time. Since the
skin infection was deemed "highly
contagious," the student got immedi-
ate care with a special "code" given
via phone to bypass the scheduling
portion and she moved straight to
waiting for a doctor.
I don't believe the doctors, secre-
taries or nurses are the ones at fault
in UHS. Rather, it's the bureaucratic
system. The fact that UHS is under-
staffed only complicates matters,
making waittimes too long and creat-
ing the necessity for a triage system.
The triage system, in turn, is unfair
to those with medical problems who
are qualitatively not deemed "imme-
diate," or "contagious" though the
student has been suffering for weeks
or may need immediate help. An inac-
curate diagnosis is more likely when
the staff feels pressured, overworked
and stressed. The point of having free
health care at the University is to help
students get better more quickly so
they can return to schoolwork. The
new UHS program isn't fulfilling this
need. The triage system needs to be
modified to help our students get bet-
ter faster and make sure our peers and
friends aren't sick for an entire term.

Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican
president, probably wouldn't win the Repub-
lican nomination for president if he ran today,
if the film"Lincoln" is any indication. Know-
ing director Steven Spielberg, writer Tony
Kuchner and lead actor Daniel Day-Lewis, it
was probably as historically accurate as a film
can get. In fact, Lincoln probably wouldn't
survive the first few primaries of the Republi-
can nomination process. The reason? He just
wasn't conservative enough.
As seen in "Lincoln," there were two
major Republican factions in the 1860s - the
radicals and the conservatives, akin to the
modern day Tea Party and moderate, Mitt.
Romney Republicans, respectively. However,
in the 1860s, the Republicans were the liberal
party, the one pushing the country toward'
progressive ideas. The Republicans were the
ones who wanted to abolish slavery, and Lin-
coln, straddling the line between moderate
and radical, wholeheartedly agreed. How-
ever, he never made slavery - a moral and
social issue to the Republicans - a fixture
of his campaign. In modern-day America,
a Republican cannot win the support of the
staunchly conservative base without straying
so far to the right as to make him unrecogniz-
able to centrists.
Furthermore, Lincoln believed in the wacky
idea of compromise, of working with people
with differing beliefs and political parties to
achieve a mutual goal. Day-Lewis's Lincolm
even says in the movie he wanted the Thir-
teenth Amendment to have bipartisan support.
Does the conservative faction of the Repub-
lican Party want to compromise? They hold
any possible debt deal hostage with a series of
unnecessary expenditures and tax cuts, which
economistsand the U.S. Department of Defense
have said could be dangerous. Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell even said the goal of

Republicans in 2010 should not be to fix the
country, but to ensure that President Barack
Obama only served one term. That doesn't seem
conciliatory to me.
Lincoln would've been eviscerated by his
own party for working with Democrats, how-
ever subtly, to achieve his goal. That's not
how the modern conservative behaves. That's
not how the modern liberal tends to behave,
although the liberals are less forthright about
their unwillingness to work across the aisle.
Conservatives don't even attempt to hide
their disdain for their liberal counterparts.
The most telling sign of the shift of the
Republican Party was in a speech Thaddeus
Stevens (played by Tommy Lee Jones) gave
in the film before the House of Representa-
tives. He sacrificed his personal beliefs in
order to better the nation; the sacrifice of the
few to benefit the many. He made that sacri-
fice. Lincoln made that sacrifice. Republicans
have been more dependent on playingup their
personal moral beliefs, rather than seeingthe
bigger picture and how personal sacrifices
could help the nation as a whole - see: Todd
Akin/Richard Mourdock on rape and Marco
Rubio on creationism.
Republicans, see how you've changed! So
hnuch so that you wouldn't elect the great-
est president to ever come from your party.
Republicans and Democrats can both learn
from "Lincoln." The American Dream isn't
just white picket fences, minivans and subur-
ban schools. The American Dream is the idea
that any man can save the world with democ-
racy, and that democracy, despite its flaws,
can be a beautiful thing when it works prop-
erly. It was a beautiful thing during the time
of Lincoln. It will be a beautiful thing again.
We all just need to change.

Ten new members elected Egypt crisis raises fears
to 2013 LSA- SG positions of 'second revolution'

Three ballot

S Though only 6.4 percent of
LSA students voted in the col-
lege's student government elec-
tion, those who participated
elected 10 new members and
approved three ballot questions.
The candidates who won the
10 open seats as LSA-SG repre-
sentatives are Ibrahim Hamati,
Will Canning, Ilana Lieberman,
Sook Peng How, Tyler Mesman,
Kelli Bartelotti, Allie Ham-
moud, Justin Hart, Kendall
Johnson, and William O'Brien
- in order of decreasing vote
count.
All candidates are new to the
position of LSA-SG represen-
tative, with the exception of
Johnson, who was re-elected
to her seat. The platforms of
the candidates included initia-
tives to increase transparency
between LSA-SG and the stu-
dent body, improve transpor-
tation between campus and
off-campus housing, increase
printing pages allotted for stu-
dents and coordinate to bring
more concerts to campus.

Besides holding elections for
10 open representative posi-
tions, LSA-SG allowed students
to vote on three ballot questions
that allow the University to .
'gauge students's perceptions on
University issues.
Athletes are allowed to reg-
ister for courses at an earlier
time than the rest of the student
body in order to compensate for
their practice schedules. The
first question on the LSA-SG
ballot asked students whether
they were in favor of granting
a similar opportunity to the
University's Reserve Officer
Training Corp. The ballot ques-
tion passed with 55 percent of
participating students voting in
favor of allowing ROTC mem-
bers to register early, 25 percent
were opposed and 20 percent
had no preference.
The second LSA-SG ballot
proposal addressed the limited
capacityofthe LSA courseguide
and asked students if they were
in favor of adding an option that
allows them to search for cours-
es available at select times.
The course guide now
requires that students search
through classes classified only
through subject and course
level, and the new option would
allow users to search classes
that fit gaps in their schedule.

other firms, since 2002. The
Wall Street Journal reported
that individuals familiar with
the case have confirmed that the
expert network firm used in the
scheme was Gerson Lerhman.
Bret Coons - a spokesman
for the Joint Commission, a
hospital accreditation organiza-
tion - said external decisions
of individual employees would
not generally affect a hospital's
accreditation unless patient safe-
ty or care quality was impacted.
"The Joint Commission's
accreditation looks at issues of
patient safety and quality of care
and would not be applicable to
the personal financial practices
of employees of an accredited
health care organization," Coons
said.
Coons could not confirm
whether or not Gilman was being
investigated.
Gilman has signed a non-pros-
ecution agreement with the SEC,
meaning he will not be criminal-
ly charged because he has agreed
to testify and cooperate with fur-
ther investigations. He will pay
$234,000 in settling the suit.

The third ballot question on
the LSA-SG poll questioned
whether or not students were

Act - a recently established
state policy that allows students
to seek medical assistance for

it be included in the Statement

The amendment passed with
65 percent of students voting
that they were aware of the law
and in favor of amending the
statement. Students unaware of
the law, but in favor of chang-
ing the statement totaled 17
percent. Only 2 percent of stu-
dents were aware of the law
but opposed the changes, and
4 percent of students were not
aware of the law and opposed
the amendments.
Twelves percent of students
who voted had no preference on
amending the statement.

and staff Thursday regarding

to be the parent company of CR
Intrinsic, SAC Capital Advisors.
Though he is not explicitly men-
tioned in the suit, it is suspected
that Steven Cohen, the compa-
ny's founder and owner, is impli-
cated in the scheme.

Deadline for launch
of new constitution
looms
CAIRO (AP) - Faced with
an unprecedented strike by the
courts and massive opposition
protests, Egypt's Islamist presi-
dent is not backing down in the
showdown over decrees granting
him near-absolute powers.
Activists warn that his actions
threaten a "second revolution,"
but Mohammed Morsi faces a dif-
ferent situation than his ousted
predecessor, Hosni Mubarak: He
was democratically elected and
enjoys the support of the nation's
most powerful political move-
ment.
Already, Morsi is rushing the
work of an Islamist-dominated
constitutional assembly at the
heart of the power struggle, with
a draft of the charter expected
as early as Thursday, despite a
walkout by liberal and Christian
members that has raised ques-
tions about the panel's legiti-
macy.
ZBT
From Page 1A
they have not proven true. He
added that he feels the national
organization is using the claim of
a dangerous living atmosphere as
a means of revoking the chapter
becausethey cannotact on previ-
ous unproven hazing allegations.
ZBT has not been a member of
the University's Interfraternity
Council since 2006, when the
chapter was expelled for violat-
ing restrictions on recruiting
new members. IFC placed the
chapter on probation the previ-
ous year for allegations of hazing
that involved forcing pledging to
engage in excessive exercise, eat-
ing and drinking.
The ZBT member said while
there is a feeling of disappoint-
ment within the fraternity, they
also feel frustrated that their
nationals did not seek alternative
solutions before officially dis-
banding the chapter. He added
the 92 members of the frater-
nity will possibly appeal to their
national council regarding the
official closing of the chapter.
ZBT's national organiza-
tion did not respond to repeated
requests for comment.

The next step would be for
Morsi to call a nationwide ref-
erendum on the document. If
adopted, parliamentary elec-
tions would be held by the spring.
Wednesday brought a last-
minute scramble to seize the
momentum over Egypt's politi-
cal transition. Morsi's camp
announced that his Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamists
will stage amassive rally in Cairo's
Tahrir Square, the plaza where
more than 200,000 opposition
supporters gathered a dayearlier.
The Islamists' choice of the
square for Saturday's rally raises
the possibility of clashes. Several
hundred Morsi opponents are
camped out there, and another
group is fighting the police on a
nearby street.
"It is tantamount to a dec-
laration of war," said liberal
politician Mustafa al-Naggar,
speaking on the private Al-Tah-
rir TV station.
Morsi remains adamant that
his decrees, which place him
above oversight of any kind,
including by the courts, are in
the interest of the nation's tran-
When the ZBT chapter was
removed from IFC in 2006,
then-IFC spokesman Brian Mill-
man and then-IFC president Jon
Krasnov said in a joint written
statement that the chapter defied
the IFC standards and principles.
"ZBT's continued indifference
toward the values embraced by
the Greek community has dem-
onstrated its inability to func-
tion as a contributing member
of the Interfraternity Council at
the University of Michigan," the
statement said.
Neither Ryan Gross, the media
relations spokesperson for IFC,
nor the Office of Greek Life were
able to comment on the closure
due to the fact that ZBT is not
currently an official member of
the University's Greek system.
Additionally, ZBT's national
body has stationed a security
guard outside the chapter's
Oxford Road house. Accordingto
an internal e-mail sent to mem-
bers of a University Panhellenic
Association sorority obtained
by the Daily- which contained
a report of Tuesday's meeting of
the Panhellenic Executive Board
- the precaution was taken to
ensure that no damage is done to
the property and no parties are
held.

sition to democratic rule.
Backing down may not be an
option for the 60-year-old U.S.-
educated engineer.
Doing so would significantly
weaken him and the Brother-
hood at a time when their image
has been battered by widespread
charges that they are too preoc-
cupied with tightening their grip
on power to effectivelytackle the
country's many pressing prob-
lems.
Morsi's pride is also a key
factor in a country where most
people look to their leader as an
invincible figure.
He may not be ready to stom-
ach another public humilia-
tion after backing down twice
since taking office in June. His
attempt to reinstate parliament's
Islamist-dominated lower cham-
ber after it was disbanded in July
by the Supreme Constitutional
Court was overturned by that
same court. Last month, Morsi
was forced to reinstate the coun-
try's top prosecutor just days
after firing him when the judi-
ciary ruled it was not within his
powers to do so.
The ZBT member said the
chapter is examining their legal
rights to privacy in regards to the
permanently stationed officer.
If the national body, which
owns the ZBT chapter house,
decides to sell the home on
Oxford, University Housing
spokesman Peter Logan said
University Housing would most
likely be unable to accommodate
the many ZBT members who will
be without a place to live.
University spokesman. Rick
Fitzgerald said University orga-
nizations are unable to com-
ment on the closure of the
chapter because the fraternity's
national headquarters made the
decision, without any influence
by administering bodies of the
University. /
"There's really no action from
the University - the action is
from the fraternity's national
organization," Fitzgerald said.
Other fraternity chapters on
campus have also been booted
from the IFC. In March 2011,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
was expelled from University
Greek Life after allegations of
hazingsurfaced. However, SAE's
national organization only sus-
pended the chapter and it still
has a house near campus.



comprehensive legislation.
"That's the balancing act, it's
not time for me to pick some num-
ber or some percentage, it's time
to say that is a factor that we've
learned from, that we should be
gathering data to say when you
put all these variables together,
what's a good outcome," Snyder
said.
Public Policy Prof. Barry Rabe
said Snyder's address lacked nota-
ble changes from the state's cur-
rent energy policy.
"(Snyder) covered a wide range
of areas, but I'm not sure that we
really heard any major new addi-
tions or dramatic departures,"
Rabe said.
Rabe said Snyder's policy on
fracking was vague and likely to
spark some disapproval among
Michigangesidents.
"There really wasn't a lot of
specifics to (the fracking poli-
cy)," Rabe said. "So that would
suggest he's not necessarily look-
ing at new legislation or themes
or directions, though fracking
has become increasingly contro-
versial in the state."

He added he felt Snyder did
not put enough emphasis on the
state's reliance on coal and the
question of renewable energy for
the future.
LSA junior Chris Takahashi,
the founder and president of Stu-
dents for Clean Energy, said Sny-
der's position on Proposal 3 and
renewable wind energy was a big
oversight.
"Proposal 3 would have been
a huge boost for our economy
and is well within reach for us to
achieve," Takahashi said.
Takashi said much of the pol-
icy Snyder outlined was "safe"
and was not nuanced enough in
establishing policy to innovate
the state's energy methods mov-
ing forward, adding that coal is a
critical issues that the governor
should put more focus on.
"Coal is imported into the
state of Michigan, it's costly, it's
terrible for public health and
that's something that, as a group,
we're advocating that we need to
stop relying on coal at the Uni-
versity level and in the state of
Michigan," Takahashi said.

CSG
From Page 1A
Election Commission hearing
on the final day of voting that
lasted until 7 a.m. the next day,
ultimately delaying results.
Despite a much tamer elec-
tion featuring none of the
aforementioned complexities,
the November election will
also have a delay in election
results, CSG election director
Jeremy Garson said.
"We are working with ITS
to confirm all of the election
results," Garson wrote. "We
will be releasing the results
at noon tomorrow as per the
Election Code."
It is unknown why results
are being held, though there
did appear to be an error with
the ballot for Rackham assem-
bly representatives.
Of the 18 seats voted on,
eight were for Rackham rep-
resentative positions though
there were no formally regis-
tered candidates for the posi-
tion. The ballot for Rackham
assembly representative only
allowed voters to write-in one
candidate rather than eight.
Rackham has the second
highest amount of seats on the
Assembly at 10, but only two
seats are currently occupied.
The ballot is supposed to allow
constituents to vote for as
many candidates as there are
open seats, but seven-eighths
of Rackham CSG's ballot was
missing.
The election code section of
the CSG Compiled Code states
that the election director has
12 hours from the end of the
election to release the results
to candidates and The Michi-
gan Daily, but traditionally the
results are released sooner.

Last year's November elec-
tion released results shortly
after polls closed at midnight.
Though the CSG results were not
released, the elected candidates
for LSA Student Government
and the University of Michigan

Engineering Council were both
released shortly after mid-
night.
Garson did not respond to
requests for an interview spe-
cifically regarding the decision
to release the results at noon.

Leveson Report on British
press set to be released today

Recommendations
come in wake of
phone-hacking
scandal
LONDON (AP) - Prime Min-
ister David Cameron failed to
offer any clues Wednesday on
whether he will support new
more stringent regulation of
Britain's press following the
conclusion of a yearlong inquiry
into the country's unruly tab-
loids.
Cameron got a sneak preview
of Lord Justice Brian Leve-
son's report, which is set for
public release Thursday. But in
carefully crafted remarks that
shielded how he would respond
to the judge's recommenda-
tions, Cameron told lawmakers
he wanted all of the major par-
ties to agree on the next step.
"Whatever the changes we
make, we wanta robust and free

press in our country," Cameron
said.
The inquiry was launched
after revelations of widespread
illegal behavior at the News of
the World, the top-selling Sun-
day publication that was eventu-
ally closed by its owner, Rupert
Murdoch's News International.
The scandal rocked Britain's
establishment with evidence of
media misdeeds, police corrup-
tion and too-cozy links between
the press and politicians.
And News International,
which is part of New York listed
News Corp., has been hit with
dozens of -lawsuits over the
interception of telephone voice-
mails. Reporters and executives
have been arrested - and the
entire media supervision system
has been called into question.
The essential issue swirling
around the report is whether
the government will pass new
laws to curb the press, possibly
involving the creation of a new
regulatory body, or whether

some modifications can be made
to the current system whereby
the press monitors itself, so-
called self-regulation.
Cameron declined to respond
to members of his own Conser-
vative Party, who are pressur-
ing the government to pass new
laws. Instead, he said he would
meet with opposition leaders
about the report's contents in a
quest for cross-party support.
"What matters most I believe
is that we end up with an inde-
pendent regulatory system that
can deliver, and in which the
public have confidence," he said.
Harriet Harman, the deputy
leader of the Labour opposition,
said she agreed with Cameron's
comments, telling the BBC the
present system had failed.
"Yes, it has to be independent
of government and politics and
Parliament. We don't want to
have anything to do with regu-
lating the press," she said. "But
it's also got to be independent
of newspapers. You can't have

Appeals to Congress
for tens of billions of
dollars in assistance
WASHINGTON (AP) - New
York City Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg appealed to congressional
leadersWednesdayforquickaction
on providing tens of billions of dol-
lars in new federal aid to help his
city and state and others recover
from Superstorm Sandy but was
told it might be some time before
it's forthcoming - and it likely
won't be all at once.
Bloomberg met with more than
a half-dozen lawmakers, including
several who chair or siton commit-
tees controlling the government's
purse strings, aswell and both par-
ties' leaders in the House and Sen-
ate.
"Hurricane recovery is not a
partisan issue," he told reporters
at a news conference in between
the meetings. "We have to bring
together both sides in Washing-
ton."
New York state alone is seeking
$42billionin additionalfederal aid.
New Jersey is seeking federal aid to
cover most of the nearly $37 billion
cost for recovery and rebuilding.
So far about $2 billion in fed-
eral funds - about half for direct
assistance to individuals - have
been provided to the two most
heavily damaged states and nine

others in the storm's path. There's
about $5 billion left in the Federal
Emergency Management Agency's
disaster relief fund, but last year's
budget agreement permits Presi-
dent Barack Obama to seek another
$5.4 billion without hitting a ceil-
ingonspending.
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine,
a member of the Appropriations
Committee and the top Republican
on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee that oversees disaster relief,
struck a skeptical note after her
meeting with the mayor.
"It's going to be ahard sell," she
said, given Congress's preoccupa-
tion with the fiscal cliff crisis and
tight budget restraints. Reflecting
a line taken in the past by House
Budget Committee Chairman
Paul Ryan and other fiscal conser-
vatives, she said at least some of
the new spending for Sandy relief
and rebuilding should be offset by
spending cuts in other government
programs.
"Otherwise it's just going to be
added to the debt and that makes
it even more difficult for us to deal
with the fiscal challenges," she
said.
Collins said she needs to see
more detailed numbers on dam-
ages before deciding on how much
Sandy aid is needed. But she said
New York's request is "reasonable"
if the damages can be documented
and added that state and city offi-
cials have not tried to exaggerate

the damages, as she claims hap-
pened .with Hurricane Katrina
seven years ago.
Bloomberg and New York Sen.
Chuck Schumer said they were
pressing White House officials
for as much money as possible, as
soon as possible, but they didn't
know what amount Obama will
seek. Whatever it is, the request
could get tied up in the talks aimed
at averting the fiscal cliff - a $6
trillion combination of automatic
tax increases and spending cuts -
beginningin January.
"There's no doubt this is going
to be a hard fight," said Schumer.
"We have a Congress that is decid-
edly less friendly to disaster aid
than any in100years. We're in very
strenuous negotiations overthe fis-
cal cliff. We know money is short
in Washington, just as it is in New
York."
Schumer said he expects the
fight for Sandy money to drag
on for months and that several
emergency spending bills will be
needed. State officials worry that
Congress's desire to- satisfy the
hunger for aid will fade as time
wears on.
"So far we believe our col-
leagues have been very receptive,"
said Schumer. "But there's a long
road to go and there are going
to be many pitfalls in the way,
particularly given the climate in
Washington and the shortage in
money."

Duke blows past Blue

Loss serves as reality
check for Michigan

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
In the opening seconds of the
Michigan women's basketball
team's game against No. 4 Duke
on Wednesday, senior guard Kate
Thompson dribbled near the top
of the key only to be swarmed
by a pair
of defend- DUKE 71
ers. Both MICHIGAN 54
reached for
the ball until it was ripped away
from Thompson and the whistle
blew for a jump ball.
It set the tone for a 71-54
defeat in which the Wolverines
were out-muscled, out-hustled
and out-played from start to fin-
ish.
"I think we showed signs of
being a really good team, but
we just have to get that consis-
tency," said Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico. "When you play
a great team like that scoring is
sometimes a problem when you
turn the basketball over as many
times as we did."
Michigan's lack of height con-
tributed to its defeat. The Wol-
verines were unable to establish a
presence in the paint with senior
center Rachel Sheffer or senior
forward Nya Jordan, who start-
ed for her first time this season.
Sheffer and Jordan scored eight
points despite the fact that both
played for more than 30 minutes

full-court pressure in the open-
ing minutes, Michigan was left
scrambling, looking to settle in
and set up their strong-shooting
offense.
"It's a savvy quickness,"
said senior guard Jenny Ryan.
"(Duke) kind of gets you into
places on the court where you
don't want to be and then they
trap hard. They use their length

pressuring us. They were so
physical, and we weren't able to
do anything. When we turned
the basketball over, they got easy
baskets in transition."
Duke also returned to form
at the beginping of the half,
extending its lead back to 10 just
three minutes in on another bas-
ket from inside the paint. The
Blue Devils' quickness continued
to contribute to easy baskets in
transition, making the most of
the Wolverines' lack of depth.
The Blue Devils continued
their run, using a 3-pointer from
Shelby Grey to make the score
52-38.
Michigan, in an effort to claw
back into the game, fired shots
off without taking the time to
fully set up - a style of play that
ultimately hurt the Wolderines.
"Our quick shots were almost
the same as turnovers because
our quick shots resulted in them
taking off the other way," Barnes
Arico said. "When we ran the
shot clock down we had more
of an opportunity to set up our
defense the other way."
The game slowed down after
the opening minutes of the sec-
ond half, as Duke meticulous-
ly worked the ball down low.
The Blue Devils also limited
Michigan's leading scorer, Kate
Thompson, to just 10 points and
6-15 shooting, and Michigan's
second-leading scorer.
With 7:21 remaining, Duke
opened up its biggest lead, 64-43,
taking advantage of the Wolver-
ines' 20 turnovers and 0.6 assist-
to-turnover ratio.
Michigan's lone bright spot
was Ryan, who finished with a
team-high 18 points and three
assists. Sophomore guard Nicole
Elmblad ended her night leading
the team with seven rebounds.
But the Wolverines have little
time to reflect on the lopsided
loss, with Florida traveling to
Crisler Center on Saturday.

It'sback to reality for the Mich-
igan women's basketball team.
After winning five of their first
six games of the season, the Wol-
verines were reminded that there
is work to be done. They were
reminded of their shallow bench.
And they were reminded why
they are still unranked.
on Wednesday night, No. 4
Duke (5-0) did everything in its
power to remind Michigan (5-2)
that the Wolverines are still far
from complete.
The Blue Devils were more
aggressive, constantly trapping
Wolverines on the wing. On every
offensive possession, Michigan
would find itself backed into a
corner with two Duke players
pressuring.
In addition, the Wolverines
were forced to use most of the
shot clock on every possession
in the first half, unable to find an
open look to the basket.
Knowing the Blue Devils were
going to pressure proved to be lit-
tle help for the Wolverines. Duke
played fast, converging on the ball
on every Michigan possession. In
the first nine minutes of play the
Wolverines had eight turnovers -
20 total on the game.
The Wolverines rallied at the
end of the first half cutting Duke's
lead to as little as two points on a
15-1 run to end the half by hold-
ingthe Blue Devils without a field
goal for the last 6:41.
"(The fact) that we were down,
stuck together, were able to rally
back, and didn't quit showed a lot
of fight and a lot of perseverance,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico.
But the Blue Devils didn't let
that momentum last long. They
came out in the second half with
the same fire they started the

game with, outscoring Michigan
11-2 in the first 2:42. The Wolver-
ines didn't give up, fighting Duke
every step of the second half
despite a double-digit deficit, but
the Blue Devils were too aggres-
sive, too big, too strong and too
good.
"We did a bunch of good
things, but obviously their pres-
sure really affected us," Barnes
Arico said. "They're a No. 4 team
in the country filled with a team
of All-Americans, so it was nice to
see in the first half when we did
get down we were able (to stay)
together and (rally) back and we
fought. There were a lot of posi-
tives."
If the direction of this team
was ever in question it isn't now.
The Michigan women's basket-
ball team has character, heart,
and promise.
The Wolverines aren't far off
from where they want to be, put-
ting that on display when they
made a run to tighten the game
late in the first half.
"I'm proud of our team for that
run that we made," Ryan said. "It
showed we had a lot of fight. It
showed that we are proud of who
we are and what we stand for. It's
good for the future."
In their first four games the
Blue Devils held their opponents
to 45 points per game while scor-
ing 89 points per game of their
own, but Michigan scored 54
points and held Duke to a season-
low 71 points. In addition, the
Wolverines kept the Blue Devils'
rebounding in check - Duke only,
out rebounded Michigan by one,
winning the battle on the boards
32-31.
"There's a lot of good signs
(from' the game)," Barnes Arico
said. "A lot of good positives that
we can take from the night. We
showed signs of being a really
good team."

Senior guard Jenny Ryan scored 18 points and registered three assists in Mich-
gao's 71-54 loss to Duke at Cislnr Center on Wednesday.

and their athleticism really well,
and I think it's not so much quick
as smart is how they get you."
Duke continued to extend
its lead throughout the first
half until Ryan snapped the hot
streak with back-to-back bas-
kets. The Blue Devils took advan-
tage of Michigan in transition,
and held its biggest lead of the
half at 6:41 when they doubled
the Wolverines' 17 points.
But suddenly, as if it had just
awoken, Michigan fired back,
as Jordan hit a bucket at 6:21 to
begin a 15-1 run to close the half.
Thompson hit a 3-pointer to pull
within single digits with less
than three minutes to go. With
less than 30 seconds to go in
the half, Sheffer made the score
34-32 to bring Michigan's run to

a close.
"I don't think (Michigan) did
anything differently," said Duke
coach Joanne McCallie. "When
you turn the ball over four
straight times you open the door
a little bit."
The Wolverines walked into
the locker room at halftime down
three, but they were unable to
carry the momentum after the
break.
Michigan mustered just. 22
points in the second half, half of
which came with less than eight
minutes to go when the game
was already out of hand.
"I think to start the second
half, they went back to that man
(defense)," Barnes Arico said.
"That really gave us our most
difficult time when they were


* Error-free, selfless
play characterizes M'

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
During the first two posses-
sions for the Michigan men's
basketball team in its 79-72 win
against North Carolina State (4-2)
on Tuesday, the Wolverines played
the way some experts believed
they would play prior to the sea-
son - ine--perienced, with fresh-
man mistakes. Two turnovers and
a Wolfpack dunk later, Michigan
stopped its careless play.
During a 25-minute stretch that
spanned across the first and sec-
ond halves on Tuesday, the third-
ranked Wolverines (6-0) played
mistake-free basketball and bust-
ed open what was' once a close
contest. Michigan turned the
ball over just six times all game,
and sophomore point guard Trey
Burke, didn't cough the ball up
once. For junior guard Tim Hard-
away, Jr., those numbers were
quite surprising.
"We only had six?" Hardaway
asked. "Dang. I thought we had
more than that. N.C. State did a
good job trying to deflect passes,
strip the ball and running in the
passing lane like they did in the
first two possessions."
The Wolverines easily won the
turnover battle and continued
this season's trend of rarely turn-
ing over the basketball. Through
the first six games last season, the
Wolverines averaged 12 turnovers
per game, but this season, Michi-
gan has kept giveaways to a mini-
mum, averaging less than 10 per
game.
Hardaway and head coach John
Beilein credit this downward
trend to unity and recognition of
what isn't working.
"In practice we really empha-
size (no turnovers)," Beilein said.
"As long as we have the ball, good
things can happen."
A lot of the change has come
from Burke's confidence level and
his improved ability to spread the
ball. Last year, Burke took it upon
himself to be a scorer, even when
the reads weren't there - he'd
force a shot or turn the ball over

while trying to make a play. This
year, things are completely differ-
ent.
In the first halves against Kan-
sas State and North Carolina State,
Burke was silent. The sophomore
point guard found himself a new
role in looking for the open shoot-
er - namely Hardaway and fresh-
man guard Nik Stauskas, who
have been the bulk of the Wol-
verines' offense lately. Burke is
averaging almost eight assists per
game, doubling his average from
last season.
On Tuesday against the Wolf-
pack, Burke tied his career-high
in assists with nine in the first half
alone. Though he went on to have
18 points, his 11 assists - a career-
high and good for his first career
double-double - were the high-
light of his game.
"This year I know we have more
weapons and guys who can score
and that kind of opens me up,"
Burke said. "It's a matter of mak-
ing the read the defense gives to
us. What was there was getting
deep into the paint and kicking it
out to Nik and Tim early,"
Beilein said Burke continues
to work on his ball control and
limiting turnovers in practice by
making the right adjustments
after a performance with which
he's unsatisfied. Burke said that
he also spends time working with
assistant coach LaVall Jordan on
making good reads and keeping
poised and patient while running
the offense.
But how different is Burke's
play compared to last year's?
Would last season's team be able
to win without the scoring contri-
bution from Burke, as this year's
squad has done?
"That would've been difficult,"
Beilein said. "But that nine assists
though, he was finding the open
men. ... He wants to win, and
whether he has to score points -
because they were locking up the
rails on Nik and Tim (on Tuesday)
- he just goes to work. He's got
that ability that only the best point
guards have to jump it in from 15
to 20 feet."

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.

"Les Miserables"
Perhaps you've seen a stage production of the hit
musical or already have your tickets to the midnight
release of the upcoming film starring Anne Hatha-
way, Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried. But let's
go all the way back to 1862, when French writer
Victor Hugo first published the historical-fiction
novel "Les Miserables." The book interweaves sev-
eral stories, focusing mainly on ex-convict Jean
Valjean's quest for redemption.
The Lion's Roar - First Aid Kit
Launched into fame by posting an exquisite,
stripped-down cover of Fleet Foxes's "Tiger
Mountain Peasant Song" on YouTube in 2008,
Swedish sisters Johanna and Klara Soderberg
have emerged as a powerful force in today's folk
scene. Their second album The Lion's Roar comes
just as the duo has garnered a broader audience,
and highlights their simple, Americana-inspired
music laden with rich harmonies.
"Jingle All the Way"
Do you have the post-Black Friday blues? Want
to watch (someone else) endure the arduous task of
holiday gift getting? In "Jingle All the Way," Arnold
Schwarzenegger plays a father who forgets to buy
the hottest new toy of the season, a Turbo Man
action figure, for his son. The quest for the coveted
doll is sure to induce empathy, and a lot of laughs.
It certainly is the most wonderful time of year - to
pre-order and shop online.
"Ben and Kate"
FOX's family sitcom "Ben and Kate" has been
this season's comedy sleeper hit. In just nine epi-
sodes, theseries has landed both the jokes and the
heartwarming moments, even doingthe impossible
by making a likeable child character. While char-
acters on "The New Normal" are busy shouting
cliches, the Fox siblings prove that the "unconven-
tional family" premise still works and portray the
most realistic sibling relationship currently on TV.

Chips and dips sure to
tickle the palate

Assocreation's public, interactive installations have been diverse, including toy cars and broom heads.

From Page iB
pocket.
"I used to get sort of annoyed
with these questions," he said.
"We'd be up, tying together sev-
eral hundred broom heads in the
freezing dark, trying to make
sure we stayed anonymous.
And people would keep poking
around, asking us where the
money came from."
With a laugh, Graf said
he developed a thicker skin.
"Whenever we're setting up a
project, we just turn the ques-
tions onto the viewer, and ask
them - well, what do you think
this is? What do you think it
means?"
"At the end of the day, it's not
our understanding or reaction
that really matters," Graf added.
"It's what the people do with it."
Videos of Assocreation's proj-
ects in action highlight this sort
of disbelief - even shock - felt
by viewers. In footage from
2007's "Red Carpet," passersby
react to a 12-foot pseudo-carpet
made out of hundreds of upright
broom heads. Outside the Royal
Palace of Brussels, pedestrians
jump, laugh and scurry across
the bristled rug.
And sometimes passersby
have no idea what they're sup-
posed to do. Maybe it's because
these projects are out of the
museum's womb, or maybe it's
just the sort of unapologetic,
unexplained presence of these
pieces. Something about them
bewilders viewers, turns them
into little kids - poking the rug,
asking whether they can walk
over it. Some do a double-take,
and awkwardly tip-toe over the
carpet before someone "catches"
them.
How people react to the
installation doesn't really mat-
ter to Graf and the rest of Asso-
creation. Just as long as they do.
"We don't go into projects
expecting X reaction, or Y
response," Graf said. "All we're
trying to get people to do is
notice."
He cleared his throat. "Every
day, we watch people walk down
the street, barely touching any-
thing, like they don't even know
where they are. We just want to
show people that location does
matter. Public interaction does
matter."
"And it all starts on the
ground," he added.

Ground control
The heart and soul of Assocre-
ation's work? Concrete.
Or boardwalks. Floors cov-
ered in human hair. Any ground,
really. Where most art asks you to
stand back, turn off the flash and
please, no touching, Assocreation
demands you to walk all over
them. Jump if you have to. Even
"Public Hanging," a piece that
puts participants in business suits
and hoists them offthe ground via
meat hooks - forces people back
down to earth.
"At first, -their reaction is really
funny," Graf said. "People swim
through the air, enjoying this sort
of freedom they have. But then the
suit becomes a straitjacket."
Participants often lose feeling
in their arms and legs.
"And once again, they become
slaves to gravity."
This fascination with the
floor, Graf explained, comes
from observing street life from
across the world. The members of
Assocreation may have different
backgrounds and personalities -
vastly different, if you ask Graf
- but what unites them is this
passion for the ground as a work-
ing material.
"We can be inspired by any-
thing on the street," Graf said.
"A wobbly pavement or sunlight
reflected on the street."
He paused: "Even now, as I'm
thousands of miles away from the
rest of Assocreation, we're still
connected by this obsession with
street life, and how people behave
with the ground."
It only takes a quick glance
through Assocreation's portfolio
to see this attachment to terra
firma. There's "Pink Prints,"
where the crowd covers their
shoes with in-your-face pink
paint, and walks over shirts scat-
tered across the ground. Then
there's "Airlines," where an Asso-
creation member drags a bag of
chalk through the streets, weav-
ing lines around pedestrians and
buildings. Even "Fieldwork," one
of Assocreation's museum piec-
es, encourages viewers to walk
all over pounds and pounds of
hair, turning split ends into a
tightly woven wig carpet.
"We want people to think
about what they're stepping on
with each footstep," Graf said.
"Each step is an interaction
with the ground and the world
around us."
For Graf, the feet and hands-
on nature of Assocreation's work

highlights the upside to public
art.
"Sure, you're opening yourself
up to vandalism," he said. "But
the flip-side to that is the possi-
bility to create something beau-
tiful; creating interactions more
beautiful and complex than you
imagined."
For 15 years, Graf and his col-
leagues observed street-level
interactions all across Europe
and transformed them into liter-
al works of art. Every plaza was
a breeding ground for new ideas.
Every public square told a story.
But then Graf took the job
at the University, and moved
his family to Michigan. And
just like that, the pedestrian-
driven streets of Europe were
left behind - traded in for strip
malls and red lights. The street
culture that drove Graf to art
was replaced with a new kind
of street culture - SUVs, mini-
vans and the occasional bumper
sticker.
Which brought him to the
question: What the hell am Isup-
posed to do now?
The wild (mid)west
Graf chewed on the end of
his pen. "I've traveled a lot in
my life, and I've lived in differ-
ent countries - Austria, France,
Brazil."
He paused: "But I've never
been to a place as wild and raw
like Michigan."
It has been a little over a year
since Graf uprooted his life and
hopped to the other side of the
Atlantic. Though he enjoys his
work at the University, Graf is
the first to admit - it's not easy
being an artist in the Midwest.
Especially one that lives for
pedestrian life.
"I had plans when I came
here," Graf said. "But from the
beginning, there were just so
many things that didn't make
sense to me."
For instance, cars.
"The connection to the street
here is completely different. Of
course, Ann Arbor is a nice small
town, and it's more walkable
than others.
"But it's still car-driven," Graf
continued. "Several times I was
nearly killed by cars while push-
ing my daughter in her stroller."
This wasn't the case back in
Austria. "In Europe, we could
open our studio doors and bring
people in off the street," Graf
explained.
Even Europe's mass transit was
an artistic goldmine, Graf added,
with thousands of people rushing
on and off metros every minute.
And here?
"I still get shocked driving
around Michigan," Graf said.
"I've never lived in a place where
you can adopt a street."
But with time, these automo-
tive affections became a vehicle
of inspiration for Graf.
"The intimate relationship
Americans have with their cars
inspired me. It pushed me to
incorporate completely new ele-
ments in my art, like the solar
toy cars," he explained.
Still, after a year in Michigan,
Graf doesn't really know if the
Midwest is best for artists.
Graf looked at the ceiling and

laughs. "Well, maybe if you can
afford to leave enough."
"Now, don't get me wrong,"
he continued. "This is a great
university, with smart, inspir-
ing people. But you're trading
this with an environment that
doesn't reflect the world outside
these doors."
"You have to make an effort
to stay in touch with the real
world," Graf said. "You have to
try to connect with street life, no
matter what that looks like."
"And above all else, you've got
to keep your feet on the ground."

So kick your feet up, knock back

join me as we pop open a bag or
two of my favorite supermarket
munchies.
If potato chips had eras like
classical music does, I would
say we're currently in the
kettle-cooked era. Sales of these
extra-crunchy dippers have
skyrocketed in the past few
years, and I don't see the trend
changing any time soon. What
exactly demarcates a kettle-
cooked chip, and why do people
like them so much? In a nut-
shell, it's how they're cooked.
While classic potato chips
brown up by floating through a
specific length of carefully reg-
ulated oil flowing in one direc-
tion, kettle-cooked potato chips
are fried in batches: A vat of oil
is heated and the potatoes are
dumped in, fried in-place and
removed batch-by-batch. This
immediate addition of potato
causes a quick drop in oil tem-
perature, which then gradually
rises as the potatoes cook.
The whole ordeal gives the
potato starches time to develop
a beefier texture and deeply
caramelized flavor, which
many people find superior to
the light, delicate texture and
flavor of the more modern pro-
cessed chip. I'm not one of those
people.
