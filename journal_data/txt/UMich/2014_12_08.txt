Detroit courses
focus on history,
culture and
community service
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily Staff Reporter
Students registering for
winter term -classes have a
range of opjions for learn-
ing about the city of Detroit
through culture and history
classes, or through community
service programs.
Rebecca Zurier, an associate
professor of art history, who
teaches Made in Detroit: A His-
tory of Art and Culture in the
Motor City, said Detroit has
changed so much recently she
felt it was important to offer
this course and have a discus-
sion about the city with stu-
dents. Her course gives students
insight to trends in modern art,
architecture and history by see-
ing how they were stressed on a
world stage.
"The arts are playing a bigger
and bigger role in this Detroit

r City
that is kind of growing infor-
mally," she said. "The arts are
an important insight into the
city and they have something
to do with its growth, so that's
a good thing to think about in a
classroom with a group of really
committed and interesting stu-
dents."
In the course, which is
cross-listed in art history and
American culture, students
will discuss specific pieces of
art and architecture along with
more general topics including
the story of the Detroit Institute
of Arts during the Detroit bank-
ruptcy trials.
For students interested
in taking classes in Detroit,
Detroiters Speak is a six-week
public mini-course aiming to
give students and the public a
better understanding of his-
toric and contemporary topics
in Detroit. Students listen to a
panel of Detroiters and experts
talk about various topics.

Durham's caters

speciality products

It all started in a bathtub.
Sound fishy? Well, it was.
Hand-crafted smoked salmon
is Durham's Tracklements' spe-

cialty. The business started in
Amherst, Mass. back in 1992,
where Founder of Tracklements
T.R. Durham cured - preserved
with salt, sugar and maybe some
seasoning - salmon in his base-
ment. The bathtub, being a req-
uisite size for salmon, served as
his sink.
Since then, Tracklements has
nixed the bathtub in favor of a
large sink in a small shop in Ker-
rytown, just around the corner
from the farmer's market.
At the sink stands Margarito

Dominguez, a member of the
Tracklements team since 2002.
He's performing a hand-led dry
cure with quick, skilled hands.
Using salt, sugar and sometimes
some seasoning, he's smoothing
the mixture up and down the
fish, applying more to the thick-
er parts and less to the thinner,
Durham explained.
"He's really extremely metic-
ulous," Durham said.
They've also since expanded
from what used to be a holiday-
time service onlyto a year-round

business - open on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fri-
days, Saturdays and by appoint-
ment - that produces and sells
smoked salmon varieties and has
further filled in its repertoire
with other fishes, meats and
cheeses.
Tracklements moved from
Amherst to Ann Arbor in 1996
when Susan Douglas, Durham's
wife, got a job at the University.
She's currently a professor and

Black Law Student
Association calls
attention to grand
jury decisions
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
Students and faculty gath-
ered on the Law Quadrangle
Friday afternoon to show their

solidarity with protestors
across the country who are ral-
lying for justice in the killings
of two unarmed Black men at
the hands of police.
Recent protests were
spurred nationwide by a grand
jury's decision last month not
to indict the Ferguson, Mis-
souri police officer who fatally
shot teenager Michael Brown.
Protests continued this week
after a New York grand jury
decided not to charge the offi-

cer that killed 43-year-old Eric
Garner while holding him in a
chokehold.
On the Law Quad, partici-
pants were photographed dis-
playing the "hands up, don't
shoot" gesture that has become
a symbol of the movement
nationwide. They also laid -on

THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS WEE K (DEC 8, 1984)
Regents oppose increase in state control

The University's Board of
Regents came out in strong oppo-
sition to a proposal that sought to
replace elected state university
governing bodies with appointed
boards.
Per media reports, the recom-
mendation was set to be included
as part of a six-page outline from
the Governor's Commission on
the Future of Higher Education, a
committee charged with examin-
ing the functioning of the state's
public universities.
Regent Thomas Roach (D-
Saline) acknowledged the prob-
lems with elected regents because
people don't understand what they
do and vote along partylines. How-
ever, he said the proposed plan
would allow the University to "be

made into an agency of the state."
Other recommendations
thought to be included in the
report were an increase instudent
financial aid, astate-funded work-
study program and merit schol-
arships for high-school students
interested in teaching.
Twentyyearsagothisweek
(Dec.12,1994)
University students rallied on
the Diag to protest California's
Proposition 187, which would
restrict access to certain public
services for undocumented immi-
grants.
Almost 200 students took part
in the protest, which was orga-
nized by M-STOP 187, a coalition

of campus student groups. One
student, then-LSA junior Sam
Copi, was arrested on charges of
obstructing a police officer and
failure to obey the lawful order of
a police officer.
Copi, who was holding a banner
that stretched across State Street
when arrested, claimed that he
was picked out of the crowd at
random and other people stand-
ing in the street were not arrested.
He added he was not warned he
would be arrested.
LSA sophomore Angelo Cisne-
ros, a member of the Latino fra-
ternity Sigma Lambda Beta, one
of the groups in the coalition, said
the purpose of the protest was to
demonstrate support.

mediaand journalism, such as how
social media has changed modern
journalism, the integrity of report-
ing through social media and the
role of social media in the recent
political events.
All three panelists agreed that
social media provide important
forums for journalism.
"To survive, journalismneeds to
go where the audience is," Ander-
son wrote via his Twitter account.
"Increasingly, that place is online
and connected socially."
Jones wrote that she is an avid
user of social media to get the latest
news and communicate with her
students and colleagues.
"Twitter and Facebook are now
my morning front page and head-
lines," Jones wrote. "I'm on Twit-
ter. A lot. That's where my students
are. And some colleagues too."
Calfas said social media have
expedited the spread of informa-
tion, but it has come with a price.
"Social media allows informa-
tion to spread to more people at
a faster rate," Calfas wrote. "(But
it) runs the risk of spreading false
information too quickly."

However, Calfas also said that
just because the reporting did not
come from the more traditional
outlets, does not mean that report-
ing via social media compromises
integrity.
"Regardless of social media,
journalism ethics are the same,"
Calfas wrote.
In addition to faster spread of
information, Anderson wrote that
social media has opened doors to
ordinary citizens to report sto-
ries as well.
Anderson also said that social
media has the power to trans-
form stories into actual political
movements, as with the recent
protests spurred by a grand
jury's decision not to a indict Fer-
guson police officer in the death
of an unarmed Black teenager.
"It's made it easier to orga-
nize protests," Anderson wrote.
"Online movements absolutely
get real results."
Jones added that social media
has also played a role in organiz-
ing student protests at the Uni-
versity, referencing a protest that
occurred Friday afternoon in the
University's Law Library.
"Students are now taking over
the library where I'm working in
protest," Jones said. "That is the
strength of Twitter!"

The three panelists were not
the only ones who shared their
opinions through the forum.
Matthew Adams, LSA social
media manager, participated in
the event and provided his own
answers to the chosen questions.
In an e-mail to the Daily, he said
he sees social media as plat-
forms for social interaction and
engagement.
"I wanted to participate in
#UMichChat because I value the
medium of Twitter as a conver-
sational space," Adams wrote
in the e-mail. "It's the kind of
conversation I would stop and
observe if it were happening, say,
after a lecture or a seminar."
Nikki Sunstrum, the Univer-
sity's social media director, wrote
in an e-mail that the Twitter chat
events provide opportunities for
the University to to initiate con-
versations through social media.
"#UMichChat is intended to
provide our social audiences
unparalleled access and exclu-
sive opportunities to converse
with our leaders, experts and
athletes. It is an opportunity
to leverage the power of social
media, open the channels of com-
munication and lead thought-pro-
voking dialogue for change," she
wrote.

believes the studies used to sup-
port circumcision are biased and
inaccurate.
"The studies are identical in
their methodology and share the
same sources of bias," Van Howe
said. "(The researchers) thought
it was already proven that cir-
cumcision prevents HIV. So they
determined what the results were
going to be before the study."
In addition, Van Howe said cir-
cumcision is unnecessary because
there are better options to prevent
HIV infections.
"We know that among other
things that are out there, there
are more effective, less expensive,,
and less invasive ways to prevent
illness," Van Howe said.
Geisheker added that circum-
cision may not only be unnec-
essary but may actually be

harmful since surgeons are often
not properly trained to perform
the procedure.
"There is very little training
for circumcision," Geisheker said.
"There is no training protocol. It's
very common that it is the very
first surgery for the surgery resi-
dents."
According to Geisheker, cir-
cumcision of newborns is also
unethical because the newborn
has no say in the decision.
"(Children) have to be protect-
ed until they are able to protect
themselves. (Parents) should save
decisions for the child that could
be made in the future," Geisheker
said.
Rackham student Andrew
Kohler, member of the Univer-
sity's chapter of the National
Organization of Circumcision
Information Resource Centers,
said he believes that circumcision
violates one of the most funda-
mental human rights.
"I think the ownership of one's

own body is one of the most fun-
damental human rights," Kohler
said. "Especially in the noncon-
sensual genital modification, it is
a serious violation."
Van Howe said in spite of the
evidence against circumcision,
the practice remains common in
the U.S. possibly because people
have difficulty admitting that
they have been circumcised.
"People have to first admit that
they have been harmed," Van
Howe said. "And that is very dif-
ficult for guys to do. We also know
that circumcision interferes with
men talking about their feelings,
and that makes it worse for cir-
cumcised men."
Norm Cohen, director of
NOCIRC Michigan, said raising
awareness about circumcision
is important for the university
students since they may have to
decide circumcising their chil-
dren in the future.
"It is very important to make
the right choice," Cohen said.

ies.
Judith Lowe, a Tracklements
customer, has been around since
the Ann Arbor grand opening.
"About every two and a half or
three weeks, I buy a large piece of
smoked highland salmon," Lowe
said. "And I also buy his smoked
puissant, his smoked mackerel,
his gravlax - most anything he's
got is good."
Florence Fabricant of the New
York Times featured Trackle-
ments in her Food Notes for their
"trendier varieties" in 1994, not-
ing the salmon was cured "Thai-
style, with a ginger flavoring."
"Actually they werent trendy-
at the time," Durham said. "They
were brand new. No one had ever
done flavored varieties of smoked
salmon. There was Scottish
I smoked salmon, Swiss smoked
salmon, Irish smoked salmon,
Norwegian smoked salmon, but
one thing they all had in common
was that they were just smoked
salmon."
Now, however, "trendy" does
seems an appropriate word.
In addition to its review in the
Times, Tracklements has been
featured by Food and Wine and
the Boston Globe, among others.
They have mail-order customers
on the East Coast and elsewhere,
regular retail buyers in Ann
Arbor and wholesale buyers too,
Durham said.
The flavor added to the smoked
salmon, in innovative combina-
tions, was the key that brought
Tracklements the press and ensu-
ing success. It was a marketing
venture.
"For a small and rather impov-
erished smoker to start, it's impor-
tant to have something that's

eye-catching, that gets attention,"
Durham said.
Another flavored variety with
a ginger flavoring, like the one
mentioned by the Times' Food
Notes, is one that's cured in miso,
a Japanese technique Durham
read about in an old Japanese
cookbook.
"So we whipped up a batch of
miso with a marinade, with tam-
ari, with honey, some ginger and
other things, and then started
curing the salmon with a mari-
nade of those, and it's been far
and away our best-selling smoked
salmon product," Durham said.
"It happened within two weeks."
At its core, Durham's process is
one of refined trial and error. He
reads cookbooks - many of which
line the shelf below the cash reg-
ister - he travels and he hires
people with diverse food knowl-
edge. But the crux of the process,
the one that makes it all work, is
the feedback he gets from his cus-
tomers.
"The great thing about Ann
Arbor in terms of setting up a
little boutique business like this is
that there are a lot of people who
are very avid foodies, to use the
trendier term," Durham said. "I
mean there are a number of neat
things, but one very important
thing is that you get immediate
feedback from them about new
products, so within a week or two
you can tell if you've got a winner
or a dog."
Though it still happens occa-
sionally, over the years the
Tracklements team has evolved
its process in such a way that
makes "dog" varieties rare.
From this stable process, com-
bined with the different bits of
food knowledge brought to the
table by his team members in
hodgepodge style, unique prod-
ucts emerge. One such product
is smoked salmon that tastes like

pastrami. It's like eating pastrami
that's healthy, Durham said.
Tracklements tried this prod-
uct a long time ago - when it
was requested by a deli business
in New York. Since then, how-
ever, it's become Tracklements
team member Ellen Wizniewski's
"hobby horse."
"It's really good, the salmon
really takes those spices very
well," Wizniewski said. "It's
about eight or 10 spices, predomi-
nantly paprika, and it just infuses
the flavor for pastrami spice."
Ellen Wizniewski has been
with Tracklements for about
seven years, taking time away
only for a short hiatus in Ireland
with her husband. She joined the
Tracklements team originally
after meeting Durham in the
store's parking lot by the dump-
sters. Her parents were among
Tracklements' first clients at
the beginning of the Ann Arbor
phase, a time when they had few
local customers.
Tracklements team member
Pete Arno brings bacon and other
pork-related products to the table.
He's an "Ann Arbor guy" who's
worked with Tracklements for
about three or four years now.
One of the many sticky notes
on the wall reads, "Pete's bacon -
the best bacon I've ever had."
Since 1992, Durham too has
been bringing unique bits and
pieces of information to the
Tracklements table. Wizniewski
said since college or before, Dur-
ham has been a cook and a travel-
ler interested in everything food
and culture.
"He's continuously questing for
new ideas, and seeing how things
come together, and channeling
people's interests into creativity
with his product," Wizniewski
said. "He's really brilliant."
The name "Durham's Trackle-
ments" itself manifests the way

bits of information converge to
produce the Tracklements prod-
ucts. It was coined by English
culinary writer Dorothy Hartley
to mean "a savory condiment to
be served with meat."
While Durham's Tracklements
has only occasionally used trackl-
ements like chutneys, relishes and
mustards throughout the years,
the word still reflects Trackle-
ments' process of producing such
widely renowned salmon for the
followingreason: Hartleyevolved
her word "tracklements" from
the word "tranklement," which
means "bits of things."
Durham could loosely be called
the Steve Jobs of the salmon food
industry, pooling "bits of things"
- information and people - in a
way that maximizes creative out-
He turned a hobby he picked
up from Dunken Stewart - the
manager of a cottage he rented in
Scotland who was smoking fish
that his friends had poached from
some nearby sport fishing estates
- into a flourishinglocal business
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
However, Durhamreceives one
common question: Why doesn't a
local business like Tracklements
get their fish locally, from the
Great Lakes?
"Basically, it's not as good for
what we do, and it's not available
year around," Durham said. "And
a lot of people don't want it."
Great Lakes salmon is a fresh-
water fish, but as it doesn't have
the same salt content, as ocean-
bred salmon - it doesn't hold
up as well. More than that, mail
order customers on the East Coast
especially have expressed their
concern about pollution in the
Great Lakes and contaminated
salmon products.
Bigger fish like salmon, being
high up on the lake's food chain,
accumulate more contaminants

than would smaller fish in the
same waters.
So because Tracklements deals
primarily with large fish like
salmon, they count on farmed,
Atlantic salmon.
"Atlantic salmon has for a long
time been at least widely per-
ceived - and I think there's some
real basis of fact in this - as the
best for cold smoking," Durham
said.
As for the often controver-
sial issue of farmed fish, in his
cookbook The Smoked Seafood
Cookbook: Easy, Innovative Reci-
pes from America's Best Fish
Smokery, Durham mentions that
he has a rant prepared, one he
calls "The bogus war againstfarm
salmon."
While he acknowledges that
many complaints against farmed
salmon do warrant attention,
like "contaminated feed, color-
ing agents with possible health
implications ... and adverse effects
on the local marine ecology," the
industry has generally given all of
these concerns the attention they
need.
Exemplifying their attention
to detail, Tracklements gets the
fish for their cold smoked vari-
eties from the Faroe Islands, an
archipelago cluster between Nor-
way and Iceland on the Arctic
Circle. Their hot smoked varieties
they get from the Bay of Fundy,
at the edge of the Gulf of Maine,
between Canadian provinces
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
In addition to their mail order
and retail customers, Trackle-
ments also has a large wholesale
market, in the Ann Arbor area
especially.
Except for whitefish - one of
the fish varieties Tracklements
does not sell - they've provided
neighboring Zingerman's restau-
rant with all other fish varieties
since 2008. Likewise, they've

supplied Cafe Zola for around 12
years.
But professional business con-
nections with buyers of their
products are not their only com-
munity relationships. The Kerry-
town local business community
is "like a very small, incestuous
family," Tracklements team mem-
ber David Wells said.
Wells' wife Mary Campbell is
the owner of Everyday Wines, a
nearby Kerrytown shop.
"David's in and out of there,
and we're in and out of there,
they're in and out of here. So like
David said, it is sort of incestuous,
around food and wine," Durham
said.
Wells is aware that Durham
and Campbell share "a philosoph-
ical stance."
"Small business forever," Dur-
ham said.
Beyond Durham, Wizniewski,
Dominguez, Arno and Wells,
Tracklements also has a few other
part-timers, like Lucus Cole, the
son of Kate Tremel, a woman
whose ceramics brochures sit on
the makeshift counter above the
"Taking Holiday Orders" chalk-
board sign.
Tracklements generally has at
least one team member in high
school working; they often start
in eighth or ninth grade and work
up through university, Durham
said. Cole, however, doesn't work
all that often due to Saturday soc-
cer commitments.
In any case, Tracklements is
holding up pretty well.
"They have the best smoked
salmon anywhere around, and
they have a lotof other really good
smoked products too, and they're
really nice people," Lowe said.
"They do things like going out of
their way to really help you out
with what you want and calling
you when they've got what you
need. They're just terrific."


BROWN
From Page 1A
Brown's body lay on the street
after he was killed.
Students from the University's
Black Law Student Association
organized Friday's event. The
demonstration followed a larger
vigil on the Diag last week, which
was attended by over 1,000 stu-
dents, faculty and members of
the community.
Friday, more than 200 peo-
ple registered for the event on
the group's Facebook page and
more than one hundred students
turned out on the Law Quad.
' Law student Emerson
Girardeau III, co-chair of the
Black Law Student Association,
said the student group wanted to
create a space for University stu-
dents to voice their opposition to
police brutality and express soli-
darity with protestors across the
nation.
Girardeau said the goal of the
picture and die-in was to raise
awareness about the issue of
police killings.
"There are still a lot of stu-

dents across the campus and
people across the country that
are unaware and unconcerned
about what's going on," he said.
"It takes protests and it takes
people voicing those concerns to
make people aware."
Britney Littles, another
co-chair of the organization,
stressed the importance of hold-
ing the event at the Law School,
as the issue revolves around a
grand jury's decision not to indict
the officers responsible for shoot-
ing Brown and placing Garner in
a fatal chokehold.
"As attorneys, we have to go
out and do the work that make
sure these injustices don't hap-
pen," Littles said. "Even if you
decide to go to work at a law
firm, whatever the case may be,
we still have a responsibility to
care about what's happening in
this nation and make a change."
Law School Prof. Samuel
Gross also said the holding the
event at the law school high-
lighted the significance of the
legal system in the situation.
He said change can be fostered
through the nationwide atten-
tion following the protests
around the country, though he

said the change should occur
by improving law enforcement
training, especially when work-
ing with minority groups that
are more frequently subject to
brutality.
Though he expressed hope in
bringing change through peace-
ful protesting, he noted the
country's fragmented policing
system could pose problems in
implementing new policies.
Like many government insti-
tutions, the criminal justice sys-
tem is decentralized and locally
run. Each local area has it's own
set of police forces, ranging
from very large forces in metro-
politan cities such as New York
or Chicago to places that have
only a few officers.
Because every state and local
area has its own criminal code
and policies surrounding police
training, Gross said achieving
nationwide change could be a
challenge.
"Getting practices to change
across the entire country is very
hard and takes quite a lot of
time," he said.
Business graduate student
Stefanie Thomas said she
attended Friday's event to bring

awareness to what she called
a racially biased police system
and give voice to the underrep-
resented minorities most affect-
ed by the bias.
"Regardless of your ethnic-
ity, your race, you're interacting
with police or law enforcement,"
Thomas said. "They're job is to
protect and serve, I think that
people should not feel threat-
ened by it."
LSA freshman Hadiya Wil-
liams also said she wanted to
bring awareness to the issue on
campus in an effort to reshape
the justice system and police
training.
"Things are going to change,
it's not going to get swept up
under the rug," she said. "We're
going to protest things and let
our voice be heard."
Graduate students Tara
Dosum Diener and Jasimen Bai-
ley were solemn after the event.
Bailey was moved to tears.
Diener expressed the diffi-
culty in having to explain to her
children why the officers were
not indicted.
"This cannot keep happening,
and it happened again today," she
said. "This is ridiculous."

Aggregating opportunity
New data system allows for monitoring of student activity
The New York Times recently published an article
describing the decisions of universities to employ data
analytics as a tool to monitor the activity of students
more closely. These universities, which included Ball State
University, Arizona State University and Georgia State University
intend to use an individual student's data to examine his or her
class attendance, gauge engagement in extracurricular activities
or help students stay on course toward achieving their degree.
For example, Ball State specialists call or e-mail students who
have stopped "swiping" into their typical activities. While there
is potential in this technology to create a more personalized
student experience, if the University were to implement a similar
system, they should be aware of concerns regarding its possible

The story of Frank Clark

Frank Clark spent the first half
of his life in the crime, drug
and violence-ridden Los
Angeles neigh-
borhood of Cren-
shaw. His mother
was addicted to
drugs, and his
father lived half-
way across the 4
country. A profile
in MLive from
early this fall JAMES
described Clark's BRENNAN
childhood liv-
ing situation as
"nomadic," staying with friends or
at shelters. A more accurate term
for Clark and his mother at this time
would be "homeless."
"I'd walk for hours with my
mother wondering where we were
going next, what we were going to
do next," Clark told MLive reporter
Brendan Quinn.
Frank Clark was no older than 10.
He moved to Cleveland about
a decade ago, leaving his mother
behind. At the time of the MLive
article's publication, Frank Clark had
not seen her since.
Cleveland was better than Cren-
shaw, but Clark continued to live
amongst high crime, high violence
and intense segregation.
Clark attended Ginn Academy,
an alternative, all-boys public high
school. Because Ginn Academy does
not have athletics, Clark played
football at Glenville High School.
Glenville is a national powerhouse
in football, having produced NFL
players like Ted Ginn, Jr. and Troy

Smith, a Heisman Trophy winner.
Ted Ginn's father, Ted, Sr., is Glen-
ville's head football coach and the
mind behind Ginn Academy.
According to Location, a location-
based data provider, the average per
capita income in the Glenville neigh-
borhood of Cleveland is less than
$13,368 a year, and Glenville is one of
the most dangerous placesinthe city.
In 2011, the year Clark graduated,
the student body at Ginn Academy
was 98 percent Black. Glenville High
School's enrollment was 99 percent
Black.
Clark played football from a young
age, and his abilities as a defensive
end got him a scholarship to the
University. In other words, he was
given free tuition, plus room and
board, for his ability to hit people. Do
it well enough, he was told, and he
could find himself making millions
of dollars entertaining people with
sanctioned violence.
Three years later, Nov. 15, Frank
Clark allegedlygot into an argument
with his girlfriend. According to
reports, he punched her in the face,
and she knocked over a lamp as she
fell to the ground. Clark picked her
up by her neck and slammed her
down. She laid there unconscious,
her younger siblings thinking Clark
had killed her. He easily could have.
In the years leading up to this,
while Clark was busy practicing,
training and trying to balance the?
other commitments of student life,
did he ever see a therapist?
Did he ever go into Counseling
and Psychological Services, look-
ing to talk about his childhood and

his mother?
Did anyone on the football team
ever take him aside and say, "Hey
man, you had a really rough upbring-
ing - have you ever thought about
going to see someone?"
I don't know the answers to any
of these questions. Maybe Clark did
see someone. Maybe he even had
long-term treatment from a psychia-
triaL. Maybe the Athletic Department
cared about his mental health as
much as they cared about his perfor-
mance onthe field.
This is not to advocate for sym-
pathy or pity for a man who hit a
woman, but let us remember that
the man who attacked his girlfriend
last month was once a boy. A boy
who was homeless. A boy who was
told that certain forms of violence
are not only OK but in fact his only
way to a better life. A boy who spent
half his life with no father, and the
other half with no mother.
Clark told MLive that he
dreamed of his mother coming to
senior day at Michigan Stadium,
saying that her presence would be
"the best thing ever." Clark was dis-
missed from the football team less
than three days after being charged
with domestic violence, meaninghe
was absent for the final home game
of his senior season.
Clark has not posted on his Twit-
ter since being dismissed. His bio
sectionreads:
"Simply, All I want to do is make
my momma proud."

invasiveness into students' lives.
Data collection offers a comprehensive
way to support students. For students with
lower socioeconomic status, a focus of
some universities' efforts, this means more
individualized attention, as universities
can flag students and check in with them
throughout their college career. Keeping in
touch and emphasizing relevant resources for
academic achievement can help low-income
students stay on track. In fact, the graduation
rate of lower-income students at Arizona State
has already significantly increased in the past
three years. This system may prove helpful
to other students as well, especially larger
schools like the University where students
can feel lost and disconnected. Reminders
provided through this system could help
all students remain active and focused on
their studies.
Bigdatacanplayacriticalroleinrecognizing
aggregate student behavior through collection
in a centralized manner. Universities already
have access to dining habits and gym visits.
However, these systems are separate from
one another. The recently developed systems
allow for more comprehensive information to
be analyzed from a single pool of data. This,
in turn, offers a huge variety of benefits, not
only in drawing correlations between student
behaviors and making findings available to
students themselves, but also in using the
information to fine-tune academic and other
university-led services. For example, generally
poor attendance and grades in a certain class
could signal further investigation into the
course. Measuring the times students visit

services like gyms could prompt opening for
different hours to accommodate these trends.
The University should consider using
these new tools to assess the student body as
a whole. However, the University should be
wary of targeting students and contacting
them individually, as other institutions have
been doing. The more personalized aspects of
the new systems can quickly turn into privacy
violations, and calls could seem intrusive or
accusatory to many students. These systems
leave ample opportunity for misunderstandings
as well. For instance, ifa student stops attending
lectures because they prefer to study at home, or
if they drop out of a club whose meetings they
previously attended, it should not necessarily be
theresponsibilityofthe Universityto dictatehow
the student shapes their academic experience.
If the University decides to implement
similar strategies to those of Ball State,
they should use less invasive techniques to
identify students who are in need of support.
An alternative to direct phone calls could
be group c-mails encouraging students to
come to advising appointments, as well as
other reminders to nudge students toward
extracurricular involvement. It's also
important to recognize higher education is
a service students pay for, and if they do not
wish to be approached by staff, they should
have the choice to opt out of the program.
Lastly, the University should consider the
significant monetary investments required to
process this data. If less expensive avenues
exist to directly aid students, those should be
taken into account first.

Reversion to an old self

This past Thanksgiving I travelled to
Connecticut, where my extended
family congregated over two days of
Thanksgiving meals, two tur-
keys, innumerable amounts
of pie, stuffings and love in
the form of aliment. There's
a cathartic feeling associated
with the gathering of fam-
ily. My ego is stroked by the
recognition I receive from a
distant family members. I
revert to vulgar jokes around
my comic uncles. I take plea- ABBY
sure in the intimacy of long TASKIER
overdue conversations. There
tends to be a certain type of
affection and generosity that
might otherwise be absent if it didn't exist
within a space and time dedicated to thanks.
But although love existshere, so does the rever-
sion to old habits, an old self I feel I've avoided
in orderto create a present one.
I'm the youngest of three girls. While I believe
that both my sisters and I have formed our per-
sonalities based off of individual interests, habits
and capabilities, such attributes seem to have
been founded upon our roles within the family
sphere. It seems that each of us embody the role
indicative of our birth order. My oldest sister,
Madeline, is in medical school. Sasha, the middle
child, is the family mediator. I, the youngest, am
passionate and directionless. At least that's what
my family seemsto think.
When I go home, I scan the old journals and
scrap pieces of paper that lie preserved and
untouched within my desk drawers. I don't look
at old pieces of writing in order to encourage
new ideas. In fact, looking at the feelings that
inhabited my younger self's brain makes me
cringe-there aresomanymisspellings,clumsy
phrases and pretentious thoughts that are not
fleshed out. Mostly though, alot of the words I
wrote as a high schooler just make me sad. An
old piece of paper reads, "All unhappy people
are just more interesting." Is this really what I
thought about during whatnow seems like such

an uncomplicated time? Such words make me
crave the distance between my present and past
self that much more.
The reminder of that uncomfortable and
reliant 16-year-old appears time and again in
the company of my home. On family outings, I
never bring my wallet. As the youngest, I never
did, and for some reason, although I've gone to
college for three plus years and have lived in a
foreign country where the only English words
spoken are "beautiful lady," I can't seem to
depend on myself when in the presence of my
own family. To my parents, this marks me as
careless and childish. To my sisters, I'm still
unable to take care of myself. For some reason,
no matter how much I've grown up, I neglect
that growth in old surroundings.
Further,growingup alongside two sisters who
seemed to have constantly been in relationships,
I've been characterized as the lone black sheep,
who over the Thanksgiving dinner table has been
called out as being a lesbian by my grandmother.
It means that one of my uncles, who identifies as
the black sheep of his siblings, sent me a poem
about all of the black sheep in the world - assur-
ing me that I wasn't, and would never be alone
no matter how alone I might have felt. Did this
mean though, that whenever around my family,
I'd always be seen as different?
It feels natural to distance my current self
from the one that sits at the family dinner table
- unsure of herself, anxious and maybe a little
bit misdirected. It's a time for new pathways,
when employers will say, "tell us about your-
self," and I'll tell them about what I'm doing
presently rather than who I presently am. The
key is that, although it's uncomfortable to face
the person I used to be, I am a cumulative being.
Humans are building blocks, evolving over time
into new structures. And when I'm reminded of
the underdeveloped kid I once was, that girl
who forgot her wallet is a part of the reason
I'm now able to answer the employer's question
with confidence, self-assurance and poise.

R olling Stone magazine is
no friend to those targeted
by crime of any kind. The
magazine's history
of sensationalizing
serious crime
includes its
infamous August
2013 cover, where
it featured a sepia-
toned glamour
shot of Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev - the VICTORIA
alleged perpetrator NOBLE
of the Boston
Marathon terrorist
attack. Under a thinly veiled guise
of "serious and thoughtful coverage
of the most important political and
cultural issues of our day," Rolling
Stone published an intentionally
shocking cover, which sold over twice
as many copies as its average issue
at the expense of the more than 260
people injured by the attack and the
friends andfamiliesofthose killed.
So when Rolling Stone published
the story of "Jackie," a UVA student
who had been, according to the
story, gang raped and mutilated
at a fraternity party, the best
readers could hope for was that
Rolling Stone had learned from
past mistakes.
Well, as it turned out, they
apparently haven't. The magazine
published the predictably explo-
sive story without diligently fact-
checking sources. After details of
the story were called into question,
Managing Editor Will Dana issued
probably the most unprofessional
statement I have ever read, which
claimed that the publication "trust-
ed" Jackie, whom the story identi-
fied as a rape victim, and that they
had "come to the conclusion that
(their) trust in her was misplaced."
After considerable criticism, the
statement was updated, albeit with
no note of its change, another ethi-
cal violation. The revised statement
detailed some factual discrepancies
- found in part by The Washington
Post, not Rolling Stone - and added
that the "mistakes are on Rolling

Stone, not on Jackie."
For about a year, I've worked as a
senior opinion editor for The Mich-
igan Daily, and just from that expe-
rience alone, without ever having
received formal journalistic train-
ing or working for a professional
publietion, I can identify several
actions taken by Rolling Stone that
demonstrate, at best, reckless laps-
es in judgment, and more seriously,
a callous disregard for ethics. Roll-
ing Stone is a national publication
staffed by industry professionals
and graduates from top journalism
schools, so I seriously doubt what
occurred was the result of the for-
mer. Either way, Rolling Stone has
seriously harmed the public's faith
in professional journalism and sex-
ual assault survivors.
When the story was published,
it almost immediately spurred
discussion on the issue of sexual
assault on college campuses -
places where sexual violence is
endemic, rarely reported and often
improperly investigated. Given
the fact that our own University is
currently being investigated for its
handling of sexual assault cases, or
that a Centers for Disease Control
study found that nearly one in five
American women will be sexually
assaulted in their lifetimes, why
does it take dramatic stories like
the one in Rolling Stone to reignite
discussion on the issue?
Rolling Stone's story, which
graphically detailed an incident of
a gang rape, was shocking to say
the least, and reading the piece was
discomforting and powerful all at
once. It inspired the emotions nec-
essary for action.
The piece sparked conversa-
tion and protests, and forced the
issue into the minds of people who,
until that point, hadn't been pay-
ing attention. One woman even told
me that the story had convinced
her that sexual assault must really
be happening on college campus-
es. Now, issues surrounding the
story threaten to reverse not only
that progress, but also that which

occurred before its publication.
But here's the thing - Rolling
Stone's article should've never
mattered in the way we allowed it
to. Jackie's story only served as an
illustration, a particularly dramatic
example of a serious type of crime
- sexual assault - that regularly
occurs on college campuses.
Regardless of whether Jackie's
story is true, half-true or complete
fiction, sexual assaultissoprevalent
that it's nearly statistically
impossible, on a campus as large
as the University's, not to know a
survivor of it. And while the story
provided a particularly violent,
bloody example, all forms of sexual
assault are violent, serious crimes
and should be treated as such.
If robbers or murderers went
unconvicted at the rate that rap-
ists are today, we would seriously
question the ways in which our jus-
tice system was failing to protect
us. The fact that 97 out of 100 rap-
ists are never punished should be
extremely worrisome. If we can't
expect the criminal justice system
to adequately deter sexual assault,
we need to address the issue as a
campus community. At the mini-
mum, that will require continual
consideration and discussion of
the issue, even absent powerful
media anecdotes.
Sexual assault certainly affects
survivors and perpetrators, but it
affects the entire community as
well. Students have a right to feel
safe on campus. But instead, stu-
dents, especially females, are taught
to fear walking alone at night, get-
ting too drunk at parties or spend-
ing time alone with men behind
closed doors. We should carry mace
in our purses, watch our drinks and
ignore strangers on the street. We
don't need a magazine article to tell
us that living in fear is no longer
an option. As a campus communi-
ty, it's time to step up and address
sexual assault.

broadcast. This year, the show
used its higher budget to create
sets which had lots of excellent
art and intricate details. The Nev-

This year's production was much
more theatrical, with strong fly-

(especially in the number "True
Blood Brothers") and magnificent
CGI effects. The idea of having
CGI Tinkerbell instead of the tra-
ditional spotlight took awhile for
me to warm up to, but by the end,
each appearance was welcomed.
The one thing that weakened
from "Music" was the camera-

Weiss (known for his many award
show broadcasts) brought a more

movement to the screen. Howev-

not show the lighting rigs on the

"Peter Pan Live!" was not per-

the television direction some-
times hindered scenes. However,

was filled with a childlike sense

and Maron should be proud of
themselves for the steps they took
in this production. Hopefully the
softer ratings don't scare NBC out
of doing more musicals, because,
given the strides taken in "Pan,"
the next go-around could be truly
special.

Label refuses -tob

By LEJLA BAJGORIC
Daily Arts Blogger
Weezy F Baby and the F
is for frustrated. On Dec.
4, Wayne revealed that The
Carter V, which fans have been
anxiously anticipating since
2013, won't be released at all
this December "bekuz Baby
& Cash Money Rec. refuse to
release it," according to his
Twitter account. Needless
to say, this couldn't be more
shocking. And he is beyond
frustrated. It seems that
Wayne has totally given up on
any chance of reconciling and
wants complete independence
from the label and Baby, who
is not just a boss, but more
of a father-figure to Weezy.
There have been certain
controversial allegations
about the pair in the past, but
nothing as shocking as this.
"This is not my fault. I
am truly and deeply sorry
to all my fans but most of all
to myself and my family for
putting us in this situation,"

Wayne tweeted. "I want
off this label and nothing
to do with these people but
unfortunately it ain't that easy
... I am a prisoner and so is my
creativity Again,I am truly*
sotry and I don't blame ya if
ya fed up with waiting 4 me &
this album. But thk u."
The following day, TMZ-
released footage of one of
their reporters probing Cortez
Bryant, Weezy's manager, who
claimed that the relationship
between Wayne and Baby is
problem-free. Cortez asserted
that his pulling up to the club
and smiling in a lavish whip
should be proof that there
isn't anything to be concerned
about at all. But Cash Money's
record of not treating their
artists with an appropriate
amount of integrity -
even Drake has previously
complained about not being
paid properly by the label -
makes it much easier to doubt,
Cortez and feel for Wayne.
And people really do feel
for him. Fans immediately

drafted a petition on ipetition.

Wayne's final installment in
the Carter series as well as
his last solo album. Pusha-T
also felt the need to aid Wayne
in this troubling time. Push
has previously spoken on the
subject with his "Exodus 23:1"
track, but this time he went a
step further and encouraged
Wayne to leave Cash Money for
good and join G.O.O.D. Music,
currently home to Push, Big
Sean and others. Presumably,
Wayne would be able to get out
his dreams, and his album, at
this label.

The hidden treasures
of finding your
middle school iPod
By CARLY SNIDER
Daily Arts Writer
I have recently taken a trip"
back in time - I found my old
iPod, stocked with music from
my middle school and early high
school years. Scrolling through
the tracks, I'm faced with so
many questions about my previ-
ous self, I begin to wonder if I
am even the same person. Why
did I like Coldplay so much?
What was Death Cab for Cutie
doing between 2007 and 2010
that was so interesting to me?
Skrillex, really? I can almost
feel the braces on my teeth. The
mix is largely made up of angst-
driven pop punk, a smatteringof
acoustic singer-songwriters and
what I then thought was really
cool, obscure electronic music.
But I can't be too hard on
13-year-old me. Aside from
the more questionable, highly
embarrassing records, a lot of
the songs immediately bring
back great memories; the kinds
of songs that take you back just
by hearing the first few chords.
Images of concerts, friends
and summer hangouts fill my
mind. To this day, whenever I
think about old music my mind
immediately jumps to my first
concert experience - Panic! at
the Disco, fifth grade, Palace of
Auburn Hills, with my friend
and her dad. Oy, how times have
changed. (Who am I kidding?
I still love Panic). More so than
a strong memory of the concert
is a memory of all the emotions

attached with it. A certain feel-
ing comes along with this kind of
nostalgia, something only music
can achieve. There are no images
being presented to you, no direct
narratives to jog your memory
- only the moments and people
you have personally linked to
that track or experience.
Though the music I listened
to when I was younger may not
be the most inspired or well-
crafted, it was only the begin-
ning of my love for the arts. I
was just starting to explore all
that was out there, not even
really knowing how or where
to find new artists. Listening
to it all again now, I'm able to
notice so many little nuances in
the music and wordplay in the
lyrics that I didn't catch in my
earlier years. I appreciate it not
so much for its overall content
or composition, but for the role
these tracks have played in my
musical journey.
Many of the artists on that
iPod lead me to discover some of
my favorites of today. They laid
the groundwork for what genres
and sounds I liked most, and I
was able to go from there. Crys-
tal Castles led me to Purity Ring
and Grimes, The Killers helped
me find The Smiths, Kanye led
to even more Kanye and the list
goes on. I don't think of these
new faves as replacements, but
rather as improvements. As my
knowledge of music grows, so
does my appreciation for genres
outside of my usual sphere. I
learned that there is so much to
be discovered, listened to and
experienced that I can't help but
be fond of where all my inter-
ests started. Even if that means
admitting my love for all things
Coldplay.

the spiritu- "Awake:

Despite cen- Counterpoint
tering on the Films
importance Michigan Theater
of medita-
tive experiences, the movie's
disjointed and rushed feelings
may misalign your chakras.
Checking all the boxes for a
biopic, the film travels through
Yogananda's childhood and
adolescent propensity for
spirituality. After he finds his
spiritual master and founds a
school in India, he realizes his
journey must be taken to the.
materialistic and spiritually
uneducated West. In'Boston

and then California, Yoganan-
da establishes his foundation
and begins to teach the masses
his theories of enlightenment.
Much of the movie focuses
not on the life of the yogi, but
on his influence on others. Fre-
quently distributed throughout
the film, interviews are from
diverse subjects, ranging from
George Harrison of The Bea-
tles, who constantly sought out
life advice from Yogananda's
autobiography, to a Harvard
physicist who confirms that
Yogananda's methods were
based in neurological scienc-
es. However, the interrupting
interviews that lionize the yogi
distract the viewer from the
actual story of his life.
The most interesting parts
of the movie are centered on
the sources of conflict in the
yogi's life. Entering the roar-
ing 1920s as a dark-skinned
man teaching foreign concepts,
Yogananda is the victim of rac-
ism and yellow journalism. The
yogi lectures and lives through
World War II and the bomb-
ing of Hiroshima - events that

fundamentally contradict his
views of the world. But even
with subject matter as com-
pelling as the arduous life and
forward thinking beliefs of the
yogi, the film hurries through
this content.
This movie seems like an
introduction to the life of
someone who influenced the
world with yoga, using the
spirituality of the practice to
try to achieve peace instead
of as an ab workout, as is the
case with most modern yoga.
Other biopics this year, such as
"Get On Up" about soul singer
James Brown and "The Theory
of Everything" about physicist
Stephen Hawking, have a pro-
found and confidential nature
in their details that make the
audience identify with the sub-
ject. Instead of acquainting the
audience with the personality
and flaws of the man behind
the legend, the film focuses
its energy on the glorification
of Yogananda. "Awake" barely
scratches the surface of a com-
plex man who deserved a bet-
ter exploration of his depths.

Michigan at Crisler

W ith 13.6 seconds left
in one of the great-
est upsets
in college
basketball
history, Al-
Tariq Lynn
was two
rows behind
the visitor's
bench, smil-
ing from ear BUTMA
to ear. New
Jersey Insti-
tute of Technology coach Jim
Engles was tense, not caving in
to the optimism Lynn exuded
eight feet behind him.
NJIT wasn't supposed to
have a prayer Saturday. No. 17
Michigan was going to roll the
Highlanders, then put in its
substitutes and roll them some

more.
"Coming into the season, I
sort of penciled this one in as an
'L,"' Engles would later say.
This was a team coming off a
Final Four and an Elite Eight in
its last two seasons against the
lone independent in Division
I men's college basketball - a
team that's independent for a
reason.
No one wanted the NJIT
Highlanders, the team that
went 0-29 in 2007-08. They've
been trying to get into the
America East for years, but the
league won't take them.
But here's the thing about
the team no one wants: it's
made up of players that no one
wanted - no one except NJIT.
And when a team like that
gets a national stage against a
ranked opponent, they tend to

remember how unwanted they
once were. They play better
than they're supposed to. They
play better than maybe they
even are.
And Michigan coach John
Beilein knew they would.
"Those guys, the crowds
don't faze them," he said.
"Those guys live on the road."
That's what happened
Saturday when Damon Lynn, the,
Highlanders freshman guard
who wanted to playat Michigan,
dropped 20on the Wolverines.
He saw every Derrick Walton
Jr. 3-pointer and matched it. He
wasn't fazed by Caris LeVert's
bank shot and kept going. What
did he have to lose?
So Lynn's dad, Al-Tariq,
stood there with time frozen,

Nation's only
Division I
independent knocks
off No.17 Michigan
By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
Appalachian State had
Armanti Edwards in 2007. New
Jersey Institute of Technology
had Damon Lynn on Saturday.
Lynn scored 20 points as
NJIT pulled off one of the
biggest upsets in college
basketball history, shocking
the Michigan men's basketball
team at Crisler Center, 72-70.
NJIT, which joined Division
I in 2006, went'0-29 in 2007-08
and is the nation's only Division

I independent, pulled it off
when freshman guard Aubrey
Dawkins' desperate last-second
full-court shot fell well short at
the buzzer.
With 4.3 seconds left, NJIT's
Daquan Holiday sank two free
throws to make it a three-
point game. The Highlanders
fouled Michigan freshman
forward Kameron Chatman on
purpose with 2.6 seconds left.
Chatman made the first free
throw and missed the second
intentionally, but NJIT pulled
down the rebound with 1.2
seconds left, and the fans began
to file out of Crisler Center.
"New Jersey deserved to
win the game today," said a
despondent Michigan coach
John Beilein. "They were the
better team today."
Four days removed from a

win over Syracuse, Saturday
was a lesson in consistency for
a young Michigan team, and the
Highlanders were more than
willing to capitalize. They shot
59 percent and made 1i of 17
attempts from beyond the arc.
Lynn was 6-for-10 from long
range, including two step-back
daggers in the final 4:32 that
helped preserve the lead.
Still, with less than a minute
left, NJIT had the ball and led
by only one. Michigan forced
a miss as the shot clock went
down, but after a battle for
possession under the basket,
Holiday emerged with the
ball. The Wolverines fouled
him immediately, and he lay
outstretched on the floor,
pumping his fists with victory
imminent.

SPORT$MONDAY COLUMN
Mee th ne2w Mchign Man

Interim Athletic Director
Jim Hackett strolled into
his press
conference-
Tuesday
afternoon,
his job
status no
more certain
than the
man-he had
chosen to GREGt
fire. GARNO
Two
weeks ago,
he said his position was up
to University President Mark
Schlissel and that the pair
would work together in finding
a permanent replacement.
"When I took this job, it
was clearly as interim AD,"
Hackett said on Nov.22. Later
he remarked, "I first have to
talk to Kathy Hackett about
(staying full time), because
she's asked me the same thing.
The challenge right now, I'm so
focused on that.
"For me, for Jim Hackett to
be asked to be interim athletic
director and to accept it, was
about, we need help right now
so would you come and do it? So
I'm glad to do it."
That Saturday afternoon
he made a list of goals he had
planned. He expressed his
interest in connecting with
athletes, students and fans.
He noted he'd continue the
development of renovating
and expanding the athletic
facilities. And he said how he'd
handle the status of the head
football coach.
But Tuesday, when he left the
media room after speaking for
14 minutes and 57 seconds, the
interim title might as well have
disappeared too.
Because in less than 15
minutes, Hackett made
one thing clear in his press
conference without having
to say it explicitly: He's here

which inevitably, won't come
in one year. After all, he saw
what happened when you get
too excited with a coach after
one year. And what coach would
want to work for a guy who is
going to leave right away?
Most importantly, he tackled
an issue that has reverberated
with the University for 25
years, not just an issue he could
address in 30 seconds.
"I want to get rid of the word
'Michigan Man,' "Hackett
said, his face as stern as ever.
"This is a point about how
we stand for the team first.
... The competitive spirit in
my lifetime and with others
that you see around here that
played, we knew.that we had
to work really hard. It wasn't
arrogance. It was about being
competitive."
Those aren't comments you
make unless you're in it for the
long haul, because this isn't
something anyone else will
handle.
And that's why it should
have been easy to see what he
meant when he talked about his
timetable for the future.
"The standard here is
not time," Hackett said in
November. "The standard
is issues. We go to work on
important issues, and I'm really
excited about that right now."
He may be similar to his
predecessor, who somany
people despised. He doesn't
have the experience in athletics
that other candidates have. And
he isn't the big name that would
automatically attract a big-
name coach.
But it's time to get
comfortable with Jim Hackett
for the time being, because
he's here to stay. And he's not
messing around.

. From Pg1 B
his son was "too small" to get an
offer from Michigan.
"What happens if they win?"
he was asked.
"There's no if," he said. "It's
gonna happen."
The Highlanders huddled
together, at first without their
coach. They gave each other the
usual words of encouragement,
"let's go," and "we got this," but
the real message was in their
eyes. Not one of them flinched.
When Engles joined them,
they passed around a white
towel, wiping off thick drops
of sweat and catching their
breath. They were hunched over,
gathering all the air they could,
watching their coach draw up
an inbounds play to try to seal
a momentous upset with 13.6
seconds left.
"It's the most confidence I've
seen every person on our team
have in a while," said guard Ky
Howard. "Everybody counted
us out, so we went into the
situation knowing, if we lose, it's
expected. If we win, we shock
the country."
The Highlanders didn't
win off the inbounds. Daquan
Holiday got fouled and hit two
free throws to go up by three,
smirking the whole time he was
at the line. And eventually, after
an eternity of free throws and

swallowed breaths, the buzzer
sounded and their celebration
began. They jumped; arms
blurring with legs, while their
cries of joy replaced the air they
had just sucked out of Crisler
Center.
In a moment like that,
everything is a freeze frame.
"I honestly wanted to cry,"
Howard said. "The coaches, the
guys - we've worked so hard to
prove ourselves over and over.
We felt like, honestly, earlier
this year, when we were at
Marquette, we were close. And
now, to get one of those games
that we really wanted, it's a
blessing."
Added Highlanders forward
Terrence Smith: "Right when it
happened, it was amazing. We
tried to be calm and wait to the
end, but we couldn't. At that
point it was like, 'Yo, we did it."'
Smith didn't play a minute in
Saturday's game, but he still felt
on-top of the world.
In moments like that, it
doesn't matter who played the
most, or who scored the points,
or who hit the free throws or
who was recruited by whom.
Every one of those unwanted
players knocked off Michigan.
Right in the middle of it was
Lynn, the undersized guard from
New Jersey who would have
gone to Michigan if he could
have - if they had wanted him.
"A lot-of people doubted me,"
he said. "That chip is on my

shoulder for the rest of my life.
Everybody doubted me I'm not
doubting myself, though."
In Engles' post-game press
conference, he joked about not
being accepted into a conference
yet.
"We're trying to get into the
American East conference," he
said. "I want to get into the Big
Ten. How about openinga spot
for us?"
While all of this was
happening, Smith and Howard
walked up the court in the now-
empty arena, crossing the spot
where freshman guard Aubrey
Dawkins took a last-ditch heave
that fell short. They walked to
the block 'M' at center court and
looked around.
A man packing up equipment
flagged them down, so they
walked over. For an autograph?
For a congratulatory handshake?
Nope. He saw the two players,
fresh off the biggest win of
their lives, and handed them his
phone. He wanted them to take a
picture of him and his son.
Things aren't going to change
for NJIT overnight. It still won't
get the respect it craves, and the
Highlanders might still be kept
out of the America East.
But they had their moment,
and they made a hell of a sales
pitch.

This trip to Las Vegas did not
involve going to a casino, waking
up with a tiger in the hotel room
or getting punched by Mike
Tyson.
Though the Wolverines came
into the two-day Cliff Keen Las
Vegas Invitational ready to dazzle
their competition, they slumped
to a seventh-place finish out of 37
teams.
"I was not happy, and I don't
think the other coaches were
happy with finishing seventh,"
said Michigan coach Joe
McFarland. "We thought we
could make a lot of noise at this
tournament."
No. 16 Michigan (86 points)
finished behind Big Ten
competitors No. 2 Minnesota
(146 points), No. 6 Ohio State (120
points) and No. 8 Nebraska (89
points), who finished first, second
and sixth, respectively.
The Wolverines fell just
short in crucial point-getting
opportunities, including
sophomore Adam Coon's first loss
of the season, a 5-3 decision to

Virginia Tech's Ty Walz.
"We lost some close matches,
and it was frustrating,"
McFarland said.
Added freshman Alec Pantaleo:
"Our team looked really great the
first day and then hit a road block,
so we lost a little momentum."
Despite the team's struggles,
Pantaleo was a standout in the
fifth meet ofhis career. He became
the story of the tournament as an
unranked wrestler who won his
first four matches, including wins
against the second, seventh and
third seeds, respectively. He lost
in the 149-pound championship
match to top-ranked Chris
Villalonga of Cornell, 4-0.
Pantaleo was not fazed by the
competition or experience he
faced en route to the finals.
"I just take it one match at a
time," Pantaleo said. "I knewthat
I could beat anyone at this meet.
I didn't let the seeding affecthow
I was thinking. And in my eyes,
I'm right up there with the top
kids."
McFarland was pleased with
the freshman and the other
wrestlers in his class. Davonte
Mahomes finished sixth in

his weight class, and redshirt
freshman George Fisher finished
with a 3-2 record.
"Overall, we had good
individual performances, but
as a team, we underachieved,"
McFarland said.
While McFarland may be
disappointed in his team's result,
Pantaleo said he sees nothing but
potential.
"I think that in this year or a
couple of years, we could win a
national title," Pantaleo said. "I'm
looking forward to being a part of
it."
With young talent such, as
Coon and Pantaleo - junior Rossi
Bruno earned a runner-up finish
as well - the Wolverines may be
able to achieve their goals. If not,
they hope to at least come away
with unexpected victories, as
Pantaleo did, when they take care
of business.
Having had little in the way of
fun in Las Vegas, the Wolverines
now have a lot of work ahead.
"This was more of a business
trip than a vacation," Pantaleo
said. "We were -in bed by 9:30
every night. This is a business.
That's what we do."

Michigan shatters

Women's

sets five new

By SERENA SAAKE
For the Daily
After completing three of the
most grueling workouts of the
season last week, coming off
just four days of rest; it would've
been easy for the Michigan
women's swim' team to treat
its next meet as just another
midseason checkpoint.
There wasn't any hint of
complacency though, as the
team left the AT&T Winter
Championships in Greensboro,
North Carolina, with a second-

the relay races were where the
excitement really picked up.
On the first day of
competition, the 800-yard
relay team composed of Ryan,
Smiddy, freshman Hannah
Moore and sophomore Claudia
Goswell took second place,
finshing less than three seconds
after Indiana.
On day two, Smiddy and
Kopas were joined by juniors
Zoe Mattingly and Ali DeLoof
to take first in the 400-yard
relay. Their time of 3:33.91 broke
the previous school record from
2011.
While the relay swimmers
have worked tirelessly in the
past weeks after a grueling
stretch in the season, they still
weren't expecting to be the first
team in Michigan history to

"The officials were telling us

Kopas said. "There wasn't a

The momentum created

carried on into day three when
Mattingly, DeLoof, Smiddy,
and sophomore Madeline
Frost took gold in the 200-yard

"We would have one good

"We would all get even more

really pushed us all to do the
best for our team."
Unlike for the Big Ten or
NCAA Championships, the
men's and women's teams
traveled and competed together
for the meet. Individually,
both teams finished in second
place, behind Louisville and
UCLA, respectively. However,
when scores were combined,
Michigan took home the
combined team title.
"It tells the world that
Michigan is one team," Bottom
said. "That's what we're going
for and that's how we're going
to look at it for the future."
The Wolverines return to
action in 2015 at the Orange

even higher expectations.

record and the continued
success of the relay teams,
Kopas is anticipating more
record-breaking races this
season.
"With the work we've been
putting in every day at practice,"
Kopas said. "There's no way we
could possibly fail."

Scoring from
defense ignites 'M'
on homestand
By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
A good defense typically leads
to a good offense, but what if
your defense is your offense?
That's been the case for the
Michigan hockey team as of late.
The Wolverines' recent string
of success can be accredited to a
defensive unit with a knack for
producing goals.
Saturday's 8-3 thrashing of
Ohio State is the latest result
of Michigan's seven-game
homestand that's included six
wins and 38 goals scored.
In that stretch, Wolverine
defensemen have combined for
26 points (five goals, 21 assists).
The production from the blue
line comes as awelcome sight for
Michigan coach Red Berenson
after his defensemen scored
just eight goals in 35 games last
season.
"We're getting better
' offensively," Berenson said.
"And we're getting better in the
offensive zone andgettingbetter
in defensive zone, not spending
as much time in our zone."
The offensive output during
this homestand has been
exponentially better than
the anemic showing in the
first seven games of the year.
Before returning to Yost, the
Wolverines were 2-5, scoring an
average of three goals per game.
But in the last seven games
at home, Michigan compiled a
6-1 record, a result of scoring
an average of 5.42 goals per
game. The difference is night-
and-day, and after making an
emphatic statement during their
most recent stretch at home,
the Wolverines might have just
salvaged their season.
"I think we had our backs

WOMNl'S YMNASTICS
Michigan tops EMU
in home exhibition

MEN'S BASKETBALL
'M'in trouble withoutfreshmen

*I

By MARINA NAZARIO
Daily Sports Writer
The unranked women's
gymnastics team returned to
Crisler Center for the first home
exhibition meet of the season on
Sunday, giving consistent and
enthusiastic performances in all
four events.
The Wolverines hosted and
defeated Eastern Michigan,
196.150-192.400,inaperformance
that will not count toward the
regular season scoring averages
or dual meet records.
Coming off a Big Ten
championship in 2014, the
Wolverines are now a young
team after losing six of their
seniors last season. Sunday was
a good opportunity not only for
Michigan to preview what it has
been working on in practice,
but also to give the freshmen
an opportunity to perform in
their first competition without
the added pressure of an official
meet.
"It's intimidating being in
Crisler for the first time," said
coach Bev Plocki. "I'mjust happy
that they performed as well as
they did today. This is going to
give them the confidence to do

some of the things they need to
in practice in order to improve
their routines."
As the team is plagued
by injuries - with four girls
sitting out during this meet -
there is no room for error. The
team's outcome is based on the
compilation of each gymnast's
score, with the goal to stay as
close to 200.00 as possible.
Though the injuries within
the team may have been
discouraging, the Wolverines
were all smiles, giving high-
energy performances during
floor, vault, uneven bars and
beam.
"This was about getting the
nerves out and being comfortable
with ourselves to see what we
can do in a competition setting,"
said senior Sachi Sugiyama. "We
don't expect to be perfect right
now, we don't need to be perfect
right now. We want to peak at
the right time, so I think we're in
a really good spot right now."
Top performers from the
competition included Sugiyama
on floor and vault, receiving
a score of 9.850 on both, and
sophomore Nicole Artz on the
uneven bars and floor with scores
of 9.825 and 9.875, respectively.

With the Michigan
men's basket-
ball team's fate
nearly sealed against New
Jersey Institute of Technol-
ogy on Saturday, junior guard
Spike Albrecht found himself
knocked
down. He
stayed on
the floor for
a moment,
face bur-
ied in the
Crisler Cen-
ter court, SIMON
and slapped KAUFMAN
the hard-
wood twice.
He was
mad, and he should've been,
because NJIT's shockingi2-70
upset over No. 17 Michigan
wasn't his fault. He chipped
in seven points and played the
point guard position admirably.
After the game, junior guard
Caris LeVert called the loss
"embarrassing." He was mad,
too, because this outcome
wasn't his fault, either. He
scored a career-high 32 points,
and when the Wolverines (6-2)
needed him most, he was cold-
blooded. The 6-foot-6 guard
had 15 points in the last six
minutes of the game, knocking

down four free throws and hit-
ting two big 3-pointers down
the stretch to keep the Wolver-
ines close until the very end.
But against an NJIT (3-5)
team that didn't miss late,
Michigan needed help from
more than a few of the older
guys.
The two juniors did every-
thing they could to prevent
the only independent Division
I team from making national
headlines. But instead, the
little-known school from New
Jersey became just the third
team to knock off Michigan at
home in the past two seasons.
Albrecht and LeVert weren't
the problem. Neither was
sophomore guard Derrick Wal-
ton r., who went5+of-9 from
the field and finished with 16
points. Even Zak Irvin wasn't
the problem, despite the sopho-
more forward contributing just
five points and going 1-of-8
from 3-point range.
"We gotta have guys ready
to make plays at any moment,"
Irvin said. "There's going to be
days when people are going to
have off days, and we have to
have that next-man-up mental-
ity."
The problem is;that mental-
ity hasn't translated into execu-

tion.
Saturday, freshman forward
Kameron Chatman could've
been the next man up. With
Irvin struggling to get shots to
fall, the former four-star recruit
could have stepped up. Instead,
he went 0-for-6 from the field
and struggled defensively.
Save for freshman forward
Ricky Doyle, who scored two
points, and freshman guard
AubreyDawkins, who came in
for less than a minute, the rest.
of Michigan's freshmen played
no role in the game - Michigan
coach John Beilein doesn't trust
them enough to put them in.
"We just got to keep work-
ing to develop the bench,"
Beilein said. "We're working
on it in practice, but not using
it enough in the game because
they're still earning some trust.
But this is really important that
(Dawkins and freshman guard
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rah-
kman) can come off the bench
and give us a little bit more."
So far, they and the other
freshmen haven't. A highly
touted recruiting class of six
has contributed less than a
quarter of Michigan's minutes
and less than 20 percent of its
scoring.
The Wolverines' fresh-

men are talented, but until
they develop to a point where
Beilein trusts them enough to
play them, Michigan will be far
too reliant on a handful of vet-
eran players to carry the load.
LeVert, Albrecht, Walton and
Irvin - Michigan's most expe-
rienced four - have proven
they're capable of doing the
heavy lifting. But when one of
them doesn't show up, and the
Wolverines don't get contribu-
tions from elsewhere, Michigan
is in trouble.
If it can't survive that
scenario against NJIT, the
prospect of having to rely on
contributions from freshmen
against Arizona on Saturday
and Big Ten opponents later in
the season is reason for con-
cern.
If LeVert doesn't take over
the game in the final minutes,
Michigan doesn't just get upset,
it loses in lopsided fashion to
the Highlanders.
"We have other guys that
are capable of scoring as well,"
LeVert said.
If that's the case, they
haven't shown it enough yet.
