Student governments 

aim to increase 

communication over 

city’s water

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

As months of public outcry 

surrounding 
Flint’s 
ongoing 

water crisis have unfolded, the 
University 
of 
Michigan-Flint’s 

Student Government and other 
student leaders have launched 
initiatives on their campus to 
provide resources to both students 
struggling with the water crisis 
and their community at large.

Cameron Haskins, a UM-Flint 

junior in Senior Molecular Biology 
and a senator on UM-Flint’s 
Student Government, said student 
leaders on UM-Flint’s campus are 
in the process of planning several 
long-term projects that focus 
on reaching out to community 
members who don’t have access to 
safe drinking water.

One such project is a rally to be 

held toward the end of this month 
with members of the University 
of Michigan-Ann Arbor’s Central 
Student Government. Students 
plan on marching in East Lansing 
to advocate for the state to repeal 
the emergency manager laws 
many have cited that were largely 
at the root of the water crisis.

Haskins said he is grateful 

for CSG’s support and increased 
communication with the UM-Flint 
campus. He added before the 
crisis, he had not seen much 
collaboration between CSG and 
UM-Flint’s Student Government. 
However, since then, there has 
been a significant amount of 
communication, 
including 
a 

Tri-Campus Summit promoting 
community 
organizational 

building and activism on each of 
the University’s three campuses.

“Together 
we 
have 
more 

resources, more minds, more 
manpower,” Haskins said.

and CSG president, attended a tri-
campus summit involving students

Students stand, 

dance for 24 hours in 
charity fundraiser 

over weekend

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

Daily Staff Reporter

For 24 straight hours this 

weekend, University of Michigan 
students stood in solidarity with 
disabled children as they raised 
money to support both C.S. Mott 
Children’s and Women’s Hospital 

and 
Beaumont 
Children’s 

Hospital during the 19th annual 
Dance Marathon.

The 
event 
ended 
Sunday 

afternoon with an announcement 
of the final tally of a semester-long 
fundraising effort: $475, 807. Last 
year, Dance Marathon fundraising 
totals reached about $460,000.

As an organization, Dance 

Marathon hosts several events 
throughout the year including 
mini marathons at local high 
schools and creative events such 
as 
pumpkin 
carving, 
where 

participants can interact with 
the children benefitting from 
the 
fundraisers. 
This 
year, 

event organizers rebranded the 
capstone dance event from “Dance 
Marathon” to “VictorThon” to 
better incorporate and connect to 
the University community.

Alyssa 
Allen, 
Dance 

Marathon’s public relations chair 
and recent University graduate, 
said the organization rebranded 
the marathon to build a stronger 
brand. Choosing to incorporate 
the University with the event led 
to several new initiatives, such as 
naming designated stations after 
campus landmarks and setting 
the event’s fundraising goal at 
$109,901 — one dollar for every 
seat in the Big House — she 

added.

“I think that it just makes for 

more 
cohesive 
programming 

and ‘VictorThon’ gets a lot more 
people excited because we’re all 
so spirited about this University,” 
Allen said.

During VictorThon, dancers 

remained on their feet for 24 
hours to show their support for 
children with mental and physical 
ailments. To raise money before 
the event, dancers register in 
teams that fundraise throughout 
the year through campaigns such 
as bake sales, asking for donations 
on street corners and hosting

In event hosted by 
the Daily, candidates 
discuss feasibility of 

goals

By 
BRANDON 
SUMMERS-

MILLER and ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporters

Friday night’s Central Student 

Government debate, hosted by The 
Michigan Daily, was highlighted 
with emotion and tension, with 
many candidates using personal 
experiences at the University of 
Michigan to illustrate their policy 
platform.

Issues of diversity, inclusivity, 

student mental health and platform 
feasibility took center stage as 
the president and vice president 
candidates from Your Michigan, 
newMICH 
and 
the 
Defend 

Affirmative Action Party answered 
questions from moderators and 
Twitter users over the course of the 
hour and a half long debate.

All six candidates from the three 

parties offered several solutions to 
change the current social climate 
in CSG, saying it is not currently 

not an inclusive student space 
that encourages open and honest 
dialogue.

LSA junior David Schafer said if 

elected as CSG president, his party, 
newMICH, would aim to create 
a space which encourages the 
progressive communication each 
party wishes to see by hosting Q&A 
periods with not only students, but 
also administrators, faculty, staff 
and the Division of Public Safety 
and Security. Schafer is running 
with LSA junior Micah Griggs, 
newMICH’s 
vice-presidential 

candidate.

“The 
diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion efforts were a fantastic 
step, but they didn’t go far enough,” 
Schafer said. “I think holding these 
open Q&As, which is something 
we called for, would provide the 
impetus to hold administration, 
faculty and staff accountable for 
improving diversity on campus 
inside and outside of CSG.”

Ford junior Thomas Hislop, 

Your 
Michigan’s 
presidential 

candidate, highlighted inclusivity 
and diversity as important areas of 
Your Michigan’s platform as well. 
To best do that, he said, CSG needs 
to recruit from new areas of campus

A proposed project to build a 

North Campus transit center was 
halted Saturday due to concerns 
from Ann Arbor residents.

The University of Michigan’s 

Board of Regentsapproved initial 
schematic designs and bids for 
construction contracts for the 
center, slated to include a full-
service bus depot and maintenance 
site, called the Transportation 
Operations 
and 
Maintenance 

Facility, during a 2014 meeting. In 
January of this year, the University 
initiated the process for obtaining 
a State of Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality permit for 
the project. The proposed $38.5 
million facility was planned to be 
located near several residential 
neighborhoods.

AAPD and DPSS 
address brutality 

concerns with 

students

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Black Student Union 

partnered with Students of 
Color of Rackham to host a day-
long forum on local policing 
Saturday. Security officers and 
administrators from a variety 

of 
University 
of 
Michigan 

departments took part as well, 
representing the University’s 
Division of Public Security and 
Safety and the Ann Arbor Police 
Department.

About 
50 
students 
and 

police officers participated in 
workshops discussing students’ 
rights, the relationship between 
race and safety and the national 
conversations 
surrounding 

police brutality sparked by 
incidents such as the 2014 
shooting of Michael Brown in 
Ferguson, Mo.

Student 
organizers 
didn’t 

shy away from acknowledging 
tension between students of 
color and law enforcement. 
Rackham 
student 
Pete 

Haviland-Eduah, SCOR Vice 
President, opened the forum 
by noting the need for students 
to know law enforcement on a 
personal level.

“There is a deep rift of mistrust 

between the Black community 
and the law enforcement that 
serves them,” he said. “But these 
are the conversations that must 
be had ... we have to employ 
humility in order to listen to one

NEWS BRIEF

EVAN AARON/Daily

Outside UMMA After Hours at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art on Friday night. 

L ATE- NIGHT ART

Jim Hackett, the outgoing 

University of Michigan 
interim athletic director, will 
lead Ford Motor Company’s 
new mobility services 
company, according to Crain’s 
Detroit Business.

The company, Ford Smart 

Mobility LLC, will be a formal 
subsidiary of Ford. Hackett, 
a Ford board member since 
2013, stepped down from the 
board on March 10 to assume 
his position as chairman of 
the subsidiary. The subsidiary 
aims to create commercially 
ready mobility services and 
collaborate with startups 
as well as established tech 
companies, Ford said.

The Smart Mobility 

initiative was first announced 
by Mark Fields, Ford CEO 
and president, in early 2015 
as the signature piece of 
his plans as CEO, Crain’s 
reported. Since then, Ford has 

conducted experiments and 
pilot programs such as a car-
sharing program, an Uber-like 
shuttle service for employees 
and an on-demand public bus 
service.

Hackett previously served 

as the CEO of furniture maker 
Steelcase for 20 years, retiring 
in 2014 to run Michigan’s 
athletic department. Ford’s 
statement credited Hackett for 
having transformed Steelcase 
“from a traditional office 
furniture manufacturer to a 
company that would change 
the way people work.”

Fields also spoke highly 

of Hackett and his suitability 
for the job in the statement.

“Our plan is to quickly 

become part of the growing 
transportation services 
market, which already 
accounts for $5.4 trillion 
in annual revenue,” the 
statement said. “Jim Hackett 

is the right visionary leader 
— with extensive experience 
in business development and 
design — to take us into the 
mobility services business in 
the future.”

Hackett said in a 

statement he looks forward to 
leading Ford Smart Mobility 
LLC into the frontiers of the 
transportation sector.

“I am absolutely 

thrilled to lead Ford’s 
mobility business into the 
future,” Hackett said in the 
statement. “Transportation 
in the world today is on the 
cusp of a major revolution, 
and Ford plans to lead the 
way by changing the way the 
world moves through Ford 
Smart Mobility.”

Warde Manuel, Hackett’s 

permanent replacement as 
UM athletic director, began 
the position on March 14.

from the University’s Ann Arbor, 
Dearborn and Flint campuses, last 
month. He said the event brought 
to light issues on the Flint campus 
he previously was unaware of.

“We haven’t really collaborated 

in the past, so I think this is one 
event that goes to show that 
we really do want to be more 
interactive — campus to campus 
— and unfortunately we felt really 
isolated in the past,” Charlton 
said during the summit. “I think 
just the gesture that we are 
collaborating is super special.” 

In 
addition 
to 
the 
rally, 

UM-Flint’s Student Government 
is working on planning a benefit 
concert to raise money in support 
of initiatives to provide needed 
resources to the city.

“There’s 
a 
lot 
of 
higher, 

recognizable artists who are 
donating money or water bottles 
to the city. If you’re willing to 
donate that much money, you’re 
willing to come play a few songs,” 
Haskins said.

Though 
UM-Flint’s 

administration 
has 
assured 

students that all water on campus 
is filtered and safe for drinking, 
Haskins said he notices a decent 
amount of hesitation from his 
peers.

“I think they have a right to be 

skeptical, whether they’re filtered 
or not,” Haskins said.

For him, he said, in recent 

months he’s felt comfortable 
drinking the water on campus 
until he recently left a metal water 
bottle over break and returned to 
find it had been discolored and 
stained from the water inside it.

“Now I’m definitely kind of 

wary of the water,” he said.

Haskins also noted that with 

students’ uncertainty over the 
safety of the water has come an 
additional influx of disposable 
plastic bottles, which he said he 
finds littered around campus and 
which, as a result, has increased 
awareness and push for recycling.

“It’s not water that the city 

needs. It’s a new infrastructure. 
It’s a new governor for the state. 
It’s things that aren’t fixed with 
writing a check and it’s things 
that are going to take years if not 
decades to solve,” he said.

Haskins 
said 
UM-Flint’s 

Student 
Government 
has 

identified a need within the 
Flint 
community 
to 
support 

undocumented 
citizens. 

Many water, filter and testing 
kit 
distribution 
sites 
require 

those 
receiving 
donations 
to 

present an ID. As a result, many 
undocumented 
citizens 
avoid 

these sites and continue to drink 
poisonous water.

UM-Flint’s 
Student 

Government is working on setting 

up a water giveaway specifically 
designated 
for 
undocumented 

citizens. In addition, they plan to 
provide undocumented citizens 
with foods that research shows to 
help absorb lead in the body.

UM-Flint senior Abud Jondy, 

psychology major and director of 
foreign outreach on UM-Flint’s 
Student Government, said he 
is currently working with the 
Student Association of Michigan, 
an organization made up of student 
representatives 
from 
nearly 

every public college in the state 
of Michigan, to plan a statewide 
water distribution day. Jondy said 
he sees this collaboration as an 
important signal to the people of 
Flint that students across the state 
are working to help them.

On campus, Jondy said an 

optional class for students offered 
every couple of weeks focuses 
on keeping students up-to-date 
on local news surrounding the 
water crisis as well as providing 
them 
with 
important 
safety 

information.

Jondy said though the Flint 

community 
has 
been 
under 

significant stress in this regard 
for the past two years, it is 
nonetheless hopeful they will see 
improvements.

“People haven’t given up on life. 

People are still moving forward … 
they won’t stop fighting until they 
see something happen,” Jondy 
said.

special bar nights around Ann 
Arbor.

To help keep dancers motivated, 

Dance 
Marathon 
incorporated 

random line dances throughout the 
night, taught from the main stage 
by event organizers. With each 
announcement of a line dance, 
instructors would add three more 
songs to the lineup; what started 
as a minute-long line dance in 
the beginning quickly piled into a 
10-minute performance set to clips 
of more than 20 songs.

Also new this year was a 

designated area called the FTK 
Lounge. FTK is an acronym 

commonly 
used 
and 
chanted 

during the marathon that stands 
for “For The Kids” — reminding 
dancers throughout the 24-hour 
stretch of the children they are 
helping by staying on their feet. The 
lounge was outfitted with lounge 
chairs that marathon participants 
could sit in for a dollar per minute.

“We 
really 
want 
to 
push 

in-event fundraising this year 
because we do so much fundraising 
throughout the year, but in-event 
there’s so much more opportunity 
to fundraise,” Allen said.

Dance 
Marathon 
founder 

Inder Singh spoke during the 
opening ceremony about how far 
the program has come since the 
first marathon in 1998, noting the 
difficulties in initiating the now 
annual program.

“I remember one week before 

the very first marathon, the 
Athletic Department called us and 
said, ‘you guys can’t do this,’ ” Singh 
said. “ ‘You guys don’t have the 
insurance, we don’t know if your 
EMTs are certified — you can’t do 
this.’ We were panic-stricken.”

Singh 
said 
the 
inaugural 

marathon went ahead as scheduled 
only after the marathon’s first team 
of event organizers and founders 
dropped all their commitments 
and called notable community 
members including former football 
coaches Bo Schembechler and 
Lloyd Carr.

“It wouldn’t have happened if it 

wasn’t for the efforts of hundreds 
and hundreds of people,” Singh 
said.

LSA freshman Harrison Angoff 

said he participated in VictorThon 
because he felt it was his duty to 
aid those who have difficulties 
performing everyday tasks.

“As college students I think 

we’re really privileged to be able 
to attend the University and to live 
our daily lives unhindered,” Angoff 
said. “I think it’s really important 
to fundraise for assistance and 
therapy to allow these children to 
live as normal a life as possible.”

Angoff said he thought the 

greatest 
challenge 
during 
the 

marathon 
is 
for 
students 
to 

remember why they’re choosing to 
undergo the physically trying event.

“We complained about our legs 

hurting or being tired, but really 
all it comes down to is who you’re 
helping and why you’re helping 
them,” he said. “Once you think 
about that the little issues that you 
come across go away immediately.”

During 
VictorThon, 
teams 

were paired up with children 
undergoing 
therapies, 
which 

benefit from the organization’s 
fundraiser 
and 
aims 
to 

personalize the experience.

Conor Waterman, one of the 

children who benefits from the 
marathon’s 
fundraising, 
said 

he greatly appreciates what the 
Dance Marathon organization 
has done for his treatments, and 
added he enjoys meeting new 
people every year and having a 
fun time.

“My 
experience 
at 
Dance 

Marathon has always been just 
being around awesome people,” 
Waterman said. “This is just a 
great organization you guys have 
formed, and you’re just making 
money for great, great things.”

“We are here, though, to 

alleviate that fear,” he said. 

DPSS 
Police 
Chief 
Robert 

Neumann 
acknowledged 

discussions involving race and 
policing might be sensitive ones, 
but highlighted their utility as 
well.

“We’ll leave here today with 

the information you need to be 

educated customers,” he said. 
“For law enforcement, to be better 
capable of providing the best 
experience we can.”

The 
workshops 
and 

presentations took three months 
for the various organizations 
to coordinate, but SCOR liaison 
and Rackham student Courtney 
McCluney said she appreciated 
the planning process and officers 
making themselves available to 
students.

“And 
our 
student 
leaders 

stepping up and being able to 
put 
aside 
potential 
common 

perceptions that they have about 
each other, I think we were all just 
really courageous in putting this 
together,” she said. 

McCluney 
also 
noted 
the 

dialogue’s 
importance 
in 

providing a space for proactive 
conversation 
over 
continued 

mistrust 
between 
the 
police 

department and the community.

“We have to be able to work 

together with all moving parts, 
including staff and students,” she 
said. “As student leaders on this 
campus, we wanted to be able to 
facilitate conversations about this 
rift, and be able to hopefully come 
up with some solutions that are 
viable to not just students, but also 
to law enforcement as well, so we 
can make everyone’s job better.”

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown agreed and said University 
police rely heavily on students’ 
comments to learn how to police 
more effectively.

“This kind of dialogue helps 

forge partnerships and will help 
inform our future policies and 
practices,” she wrote in an e-mail 
after the event. “We also hear 
from community members that 
they appreciate getting to know 
us in an environment not related 
to an investigation or emergency.”

life. Hislop is running alongside LSA 
junior Cam Dotson, Your Michigan’s 
vice-presidential candidate.

“That starts with going to 

different orientation groups, going 
to the summer Bridge Program 
and really starting to recruit from 
those very first steps on campus,” 
Hislop said. “Let’s get these 
students excited about making a 
difference on this campus.”

In response to a question from 

moderators, DAAP noted several 
unique goals in their platform, such 
as removing standardized testing 
from the admissions process and 
ensuring undocumented students 
are safe on campus.

Both of the party’s candidates said 

they would encourage the University 
to adopt the Texas 10 percent plan 
to increase minority enrollment 
— in Texas, the plan guarantees 
admission to the top 10 percent of 
graduates from public school in 
the state to a University of Texas 
campus.

DAAP’s platform also states they 

aim to make the University’s campus 
a “sanctuary campus,” meaning 
immigration officials wouldn’t be 
allowed to deport undocumented 

students, and in a direct question 
from moderators they were asked 
why their platform states making 
the University’s campus a sanctuary 
campus should be a priority for CSG.

“I believe everyone has the right 

to a public education, the right to be 
able to afford school and come on 
the campus and feel safe,” said LSA 
sophomore Chalse Okorom, DAAP 
vice presidential candidate.

LSA senior Keysha Wall, DAAP’s 

presidential candidate, added that 
CSG needs to be an organization that 
makes all oppressed people safe.

“Not just in words, but in action,” 

Wall said. “You cannot live and feel 
safe knowing you could be deported 
at any time.”

Mental 
health 
was 
also 
a 

recurring topic, with both Your 
Michigan and newMICH using 
statistical evidence to make their 
point that there should be more 
mental health resources on campus.

NewMICH candidates stated 

that the ratio of students to 
counselors on campus is 1:1,300, and 
that for the University to meet the 
gold standard 11 more counselors 
need to be hired. They cited a 
frequently emphasized campaign 
goal — putting a student on the 
Board of Regents as a voting member 
— to increase funding for CAPS.

“Ohio State put a student on the 

Board of Regents, and the Board of 
Regents got the funding to increase 
CAPS — double the budget — and get 
eighteen more counselors,” Griggs 
said.

Dotson 
said 
upcoming 

renovations to the Michigan Union 
could be a way through which the 
stigma of getting help for mental 
health on campus can be positively 
altered.

“Giving CAPS its own space is 

crucial,” Dotson said. “In doing 
so we make it a more inviting and 
productive space where student 
feel comfortable receiving help.”

DAAP responded to the need 

for 
improved 
outreach 
and 

accessibility 
of 
mental 
health 

resources on campus by drawing 
on personal experiences, with 
Wall sharing her experience with 
depression and attempted suicide.

“It’s hard to get help,” Wall said. 

“It’s hard when campus is signaling 
that they don’t care about you. 
When you have to wait a few weeks 
for a CAPS appointment. We need 
more action to change the climate 
on campus.”

During 
the 
debate, 
several 

candidates also engaged with each 
other on several heated points, 
with newMICH and Your Michigan 
disagreeing over the tangibility of 
each other’s goals, experience on the 

assembly and budgeting plans.

As part of a response to a question 

from moderators, Griggs argued that 
Your Michigan lacked a platform, 
with Schafer then mentioning a 
few of newMICH’s goals he said 
were more feasible in comparison.

“We often talk a lot about 

cross 
student 
government 

collaboration,” 
Schafer 
said. 

“We talk about the creation of 
an academic scholarship and 
leadership 
scholarship 
and 

stipend fund. We view these two 
scholarships would be greatly 
benefitted if they were jointly 
pooled financially from not only 
CSG, but also LS&A student 
government, Engineering Student 
Government, among some of the 
other school and college student 
governments on campus.”

In response, Hislop said he 

thought 
his 
party’s 
platform 

was more beneficial to campus 
than newMICH’s because of its 
budgeting.

“Not only do we have a platform, 

but you can find it online,” he 
said. “You’ll find that it is the 
only platform that is is financially 
feasible. It’s the only one that keeps 
in mind that CSG has a budget. To 
run a platform that makes so many 
costly demands is not a platform, 
but a list of demands.”

Throughout the debate, various 

candidates urged the audience to 
realise that while each party had 
similar broad goals for campus - such 
as improving diversity and mental 
health - the difference lay in how 
they approached them, and their 
specific policy objectives within 
them.

Hislop said in his closing remarks 

that he felt disconnected from 
student life when he entered the 
University as a freshman after his 
mother passed away.

“I want every single freshman 

that comes to this university to 
feel comfortable, every senior who 
leaves to feel like they’ve found 
their calling,” he said. “I want every 
student in the University who has 
ever felt alone to know that when 
Wolverines feel weak, they lean 
on other Wolverines. I want them 
to know this because this is the 
experience that every University 
student should have.”

CSG’s presidential elections will 

be held on March 23 and 24.

President Mark Schlissel said 
the University would pause 
the project and suspend the 
permit application to evaluate 
community input and study how 
the transit center would impact 
residents.

“In 
the 
coming 
weeks 

we intend to reach out to 
representatives of the adjacent 
neighborhoods 
to 
better 

understand their concerns and 
how they might be addressed,” 
Schlissel wrote.

The proposed transit center 

spurred significant outcry from 
the Ann Arbor community 
during a neighborhood meeting 
on Feb. 25. Issues brought 
up by residents included the 
University’s lack of transparency 
with the community.

W

hen 
we 
talk 
about 

immigration policy in 
the United States, do 

we 
consider 

how the United 
States 
helped 

to create these 
immigrants 
in 

the first place? 
The 
spectrum 

of 
acceptable 

opinions 
this 

election 
cycle 

includes 
the 

extreme 
right 

with 
Donald 

Trump and his 
proposed 
wall 

along the U.S./Mexico border and 
deportation of Muslim citizens to the 
left with Bernie Sanders and Hillary 
Clinton apparently both agreeing to 
end Obama’s campaign of detaining 
and deporting Central American 
refugees. But these two poles of 
opinion exclude what I believe to be 
a vital consideration in formulating 
immigration 
policy: 
the 
history 

of U.S. military intervention and 
subversion in Central America.

For people like me on the 

Marxist side of being Democrat, 
liberals are often more frustrating 
than 
conservatives. 
Take 
the 

New York Times, for instance: 
In an editorial earlier this year, 
the Times denounced the Obama 
administration’s “shameful round-
up of refugees,” referring to the 
hundreds of immigrants that the 
Obama administration has detained 
and/or deported as they arrived in the 
United States fleeing gang violence 
in Guatemala, El Salvador and 
Honduras. Though the Times wrote 
that solving this problem, which it 
framed as one of illegal immigration, 
“requires addressing the root causes 
of the bloody violence in the region,” 
the editorial unfortunately didn’t 
mention what those root causes 
may be, and thus didn’t propose any 
solutions addressing them. Instead, 
the Times suggested “fixing the 
chaotic, underfunded legal system at 
the border” and “building routes of 
escape for families in danger.”

What does this amount to? The 

Times refuses to even acknowledge 
the shameful history of the United 
States 
that 
has 
amounted 
to 

undermining democracy, supporting 
murderous military regimes and 
perpetuating 
military 
coups 
in 

Central America. By doing so, the 
publication fails to meaningfully 
challenge U.S. power and hegemony. 
Its proposed palliative solutions 
aim to help our Central American 
victims cope with U.S. power, but 
they don’t really aim to repair the 
harm we caused, and neither do they 
aim to prevent the United States from 
further harming them in the future. 
The most simple and basic measure 
the United States could take to help 
Central America, and in the process 
mitigate 
our 
own 
immigration 

problem, is knowing our intertwined 
histories, because only after that can 

we address the problem’s root causes.

In 1954, years before he alerted 

us all to the dangers of the military-
industrial 
complex, 
President 

Dwight Eisenhower toppled the 
first-ever democratic government 
in Guatemala. Ten years earlier, 
a revolution led by young officers 
and 
middle-class 
university 

people had ousted the U.S.-aligned 
dictator Jorge Ubico. In the name 
of establishing a genuine capitalist 
society, 
Guatemalan 
President 

Jacobo Arbenz Guzman pushed 
an 
agrarian 
reform 
bill 
that 

expropriated uncultivated land from 
large plantations and redistributed 
to the landless peasants.

This measure, accepted by the 

Guatemalan 
legislature, 
seized 

lands from Arbenz himself as well 
as the United Fruit Company, an 
American corporation that traded 
fruit grown on Central and South 
American plantations. In the name 
of defending Central America from 
communism, and in the interests 
of 
the 
United 
Fruit 
Company, 

Eisenhower ended Guatemala’s brief 
experiment with democracy and 
installed Colonel Rodolfo Castillo 
Armas as the country’s new dictator. 
Various authoritarian regimes ruled 
Guatemala with extreme violence 
and terror in the following decades, 
most with strong U.S. backing.

Though he is sometimes reputed 

as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
peaceful 

presidents, Jimmy Carter supported 
the murderous military junta that 
overthrew El Salvador’s government 
in 1979. By the end of May 1980, 
church sources had reported 1,844 
civilian deaths; by year’s end, there 
were 10,000, almost all of them at the 
hands of the coup regime.

Among 
the 
thousands 
of 

uninvestigated 
and 
unresolved 

murders in El Salvador was the brutal 
rape and murder of four U.S. nuns by 
Salvadoran 
National 
Guardsmen. 

Though the New York Times and 
other U.S. media outlets followed the 
U.S.-Salvadoran propaganda line that 
the guardsmen acted alone, there 
was strong evidence of high-level 
government/military 
involvement. 

After a Kafkaesque show trial, the 
Reagan 
administration 
unfroze 

Salvadoran assets and continued the 
flow of aid and weapons.

Archbishop Oscar Romero, the 

highest Catholic Church official in 
El Salvador, was an outspoken critic 
of the junta government. He was 
assassinated by the military junta, 
probably on orders directly from a 
Salvadoran general.

When Romero had sent a letter 

to President Carter opposing the 
sending of aid as destructive to 
Salvadoran people’s interest, Carter 
responded by lobbying the pope to 
rein Romero in. Carter continued 
the flow of aid throughout his 
administration, with brief interludes 
when 
it 
wasn’t 
strategically 

necessary, and Reagan followed 
suit after him, perhaps a little more 
willing to turn the blind eye.

Lastly, let’s acknowledge that 

200 years of U.S. domination of the 
hemisphere didn’t end with the 
Obama administration. On June 
28, 2009, a military coup ousted 
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, 
yet another democratically elected 
Central American president who 
stepped out of line with U.S. interests. 
Zelaya had supported radical social 
movements at home and signed 
cooperation agreements with the 
official U.S. enemy Venezuela. The 
United Nations, European Union 
and the Organization of American 
States all condemned the coup, but 
the U.S. government never did. 
To condemn the coup would’ve 
been to acknowledge it, and if the 
U.S. 
government 
acknowledged 

the Honduran coup as such, we 
would’ve been forced under our own 
law to stop sending the country aid 
with the exception of democracy 
assistance. Instead, despite reports of 
killings and human rights abuses by 
increasingly militarized Honduran 
security forces, and despite the rest 
of the world’s opposition, the U.S. 
government has increased military 
assistance to Honduras.

In August of 2009, then-Secretary 

of State Hillary Clinton tried to 
justify the lack of condemnation by 
claiming it was unclear whether 
a coup had actually taken place, 
promising to investigate further 
and then reevaluate. But later, a 
leaked government cable sent to 
top U.S. officials, including Clinton, 
revealed she knew very well that 
there had been a coup and had 
in fact lied about there being any 
ambiguity. The subject of the cable 
was “Open and Shut: The Case of the 
Honduran Coup,” and it thoroughly 
documented the claim that “there 
is no doubt” that the events of June 
28, 2009, “constituted an illegal and 
unconstitutional coup.”

U.S. military intervention and 

subversion in Central America is the 
principal root cause of the present 
violence in Guatemala, El Salvador 
and Honduras. The New York Times 
is right to denounce the Obama 
administration’s shameful response 
to the surge in refugees. The 
Department of Homeland Security 
has 
no 
excuse 
for 
indefinitely 

detaining families it finds to be 
bona fide asylum seekers. Deporting 
refugees back to the countries from 
which they fled is immoral, and bless 
the New York Times for saying so. 
But the real underlying problem, 
even within the frame of illegal 
immigration, is the United States 
continually supporting violence and 
unrest. If we really want to lessen 
the flow of refugees to the United 
States, we should stop creating them. 
If we really want to promote peace 
and democracy, we should stop 
undermining it at every turn. That’s 
my immigration policy.

E

very day, we are greeted by someone 
who asks how we are. Most of us give 
a one-word response like “good” and 

ask the other person the 
question almost reflex-
ively. We don’t get much 
out of simple interactions 
like this, but I believe 
these 
interactions 
are 

more 
important 
than 

they may seem. They’re 
an opportunity to con-
nect when people actu-
ally need to be asked how 
they are. Sometimes peo-
ple genuinely care how 
we feel — they take the 
extra step to ask, “No, really, how are you?”

Recently, I’ve been saying, “I’m OK” 

when people ask me how I am. It’s the truth, 
but saying those two words is a way of opt-
ing out. It lets me avoid conversations about 
what keeps me awake at night because ini-
tially, I am hesitant to share and fearful 
of what others will think. “OK” can be a 
watered-down version of “I’m having a hor-
rible day,” or “I’m struggling.” In my case, 
it’s more of the latter. What’s bothering me 
is multiple difficult days, filled with anxiet-
ies and obstacles to climb. In some instanc-
es, I silently pray that I won’t be asked to go 
more into detail.

The majority of people don’t want to 

hear about your problems because they’re 
expecting this part of the conversation to 
be short — “Good, how are you?” It can be 
embarrassing to bare your soul to someone, 
the discomfort raging on in your head. But 
I have seen how being vulnerable and open 
can also be a worthwhile risk to take.

Solely because I have had deeper conver-

sations extending beyond “I’m OK,” I have 
been able to see how I am blessed. After 
getting things off of my chest, I can get out 
of bed every morning, remembering how 
fortunate I am regardless of my pain. My 
dad told me the truth that this part of my 
life will not be the hardest stretch of time 
I will experience. There is a mix of comfort 
and disappointment in knowing the worst 
is yet to come. I’m 20 years old and still 
having good days amid the difficult ones. 
Dude, you’ve got a long way to go in life, I tell 
myself. So keep going. 

I realize that I am fortunate through 

difficult times. I really am OK. What lies 
ahead will be more than fine. Though my 
emotions can be out of whack at times, I’m 
learning how to be complete in my faith and 
resilient, while also being able to unpack 
my emotional state through more in-depth 
conversations. Even though I can be a baby 
and mope sometimes, I can’t complain 
because I’m not facing an unbearable bat-

tle. What’s more, I have support from my 
family, friends and God.

I wouldn’t have been able to have this 

mindset without the people who have 
pushed me beyond saying just “I’m OK.” 
Without people like this, we suffer more 
from battles that remain internal — battles 
that are haunted by past mistakes —by wor-
rying about an uncertain future, sending 
us tumbling into self-deprecation. Situa-
tions may seem much worse than they actu-
ally are, and listening to your own thoughts 
alone can be a recipe for unhealthy think-
ing. Other people are there to help lead you 
to truth.

By having people in their lives to ask 

more than surface-level questions, people 
who are struggling can better flesh out their 
inner thoughts and come to new revela-
tions. These questions help those struggling 
to realize what their specific “OK” really 
means. For me, saying, “I’m OK” means I 
can’t share all of my thoughts on my own. 
I need a push. And through being gently 
asked more questions, I can find that even 
as I face obstacles, I am not angry. I have 
hope, which a friend defined to me recently 
as a joyful anticipation for good.

Even so, there are still times I try to solve 

my problems by myself, times when I’m too 
stubborn to ask for help, times when I forget 
the help I’ve received before, times when 
it’s two o’clock in the morning and I can’t 
fall asleep. It’s hard to remember then that 
I have people who would still answer the 
phone if I called them.

I used to think I needed to keep all my 

real thoughts and anxieties to myself 
because I didn’t want to burden people I 
love with more problems. I didn’t want 
them to worry about me or to feel pres-
sured to help me. I believed voicing my 
pain would be a sign of weakness, impact-
ing how people viewed me as a man. But 
really, asking for help, facing all your 
pain and fighting through it takes a lot of 
strength. It’s badass.

People who say they’re OK may be strong, 

but we can’t face everything alone. We need 
people to guide and encourage us along the 
way; a lot more words can be unpacked from 
the standard two-word response. There 
need to be more conversations that start 
like this:

“Hey, how are you?”
“I’m OK.” 
“No, tell me how you really feel.”
“I don’t know if you want to hear about 

all that.”

“No, I would. I care about you.”
“It’s a long story. Well …”

A 

government should repre-
sent those whom it governs 
and fight for what those peo-

ple want. Though 
representatives 
each bring their 
own unique set of 
issues to govern-
ment and work 
hard to represent 
their 
constitu-

ents, they cannot 
experience 
the 

day-to-day lives 
of many of their 
constituents 
or 

meet with all the 
hundreds of stu-
dents we work to serve. That is why 
all student governments here on cam-
pus must work harder to have a more 
diverse representative body.

I won’t tiptoe around my connec-

tion to this problem; I serve in two 
student governments as an elected 
representative of the College of Lit-
erature, Science and the Arts Student 
Government, and as an appointed 
member of Wolverine Consulting 
Group, a commission within Central 
Student Government. I also will not 
ignore who I am or what my back-
ground is. I am white. I am male. I 
am cisgender. I come from a middle 
class background. While I bring an 
important perspective to student 
government, I recognize I cannot 
and should not speak on behalf of 
many students with whom I don’t 
share the same story.

CSG elected a Black woman as 

president of Central Student Govern-
ment in 1992, a Japanese international 
student in 2000 and a gay president in 
2010. But for the eighth year in a row, 

the University of Michigan’s stu-
dent body will likely elect a man to 
the CSG presidency. The status quo 
must change.

The fact that only data about 

diversity in CSG and not other stu-
dent governments has been studied 
in the past makes it clear we need to 
investigate the extent to which this 
lack of diversity affects other student 
governments. And regardless of the 
degree to which this lack of diversity 
exists in other student governments, 
these bodies can still take similar 
approaches to seek a more diverse 
representative body that reflects 
diverse backgrounds in terms of race, 
ethnicity, sexuality, gender orienta-
tion, socioeconomic status and more.

Though a lack of diversity shows 

itself in student governments, this 
deficiency begins with University pol-
icies concerning minority enrollment 
and incorporation of minority stu-
dents into campus life. These policies 
must change so that minority repre-
sentatives in student governments do 
not feel ostracized as Others, forced 
to speak for all people who share 
their background. In light of the rul-
ing on affirmative action in Michigan 
by the Supreme Court, other options 
are being and must continue to be 
weighed by the administration.

While the University reviews its 

policies, student governments on 
campus must step up to implement 
policies to help better recruit candi-
dates that reflect the constituency of 
the University as it is. The first way for 
this to be done would be for each stu-
dent government, acting through an 
election director unbiased by student 
politics, to recruit candidates.

Using money apportioned from 

dues paid by those in student govern-
ment, this election director would 
employ student recruiters and pay 
for the printing of recruiting materi-
als such as flyers or advertising space 
inside University buildings and other 
places around campus. Distribution 
of recruiting materials must be spread 
across campus to all different demo-
graphics and to students in different 
locations, both off campus and on 
North Campus.

Next, students in student govern-

ment should work with University 
administrators to secure funding for 
a scholarship for students of low 
socioeconomic status to participate in 
student government. Finally, student 
governments must work to make the 
atmospheres of their organizations 
welcoming, where members will feel 
respected and supported in pursuing 
projects that will help underprivi-
leged students. 

People should have the abil-

ity to represent themselves in stu-
dent government so they can work 
toward projects that help them bet-
ter their own and other people’s 
situations. In the absence of pro-
grams to seek out a wider variety of 
representatives, the status quo will 
continue. Diverse bodies of people, 
through much research, have been 
shown to produce this increased 
creativity and performance across a 
range of different activities. Diver-
sity within our representative bod-
ies will help them come up with 
resolutions and projects within 
the University that affect the most 
people in unique and creative ways.

HELP WANTED

I 

love to sing, but I’m 
absolutely terrified of 
anyone actually hearing 

me try to sing.

One of the random things 

I 
really 

look 
forward 
to 
whenever 
I go back 
home 
from Ann 
Arbor for 
a little bit 
is 
being 

able 
to 

drive. 
And it’s not the driving itself — 
I’m kind of an anxious driver 
— but the fact that I can queue 
up on my iPod all the songs 
I’ve heard and fallen in love 
with since the last time I came 
home. I can hear them with 
a full speaker system instead 
of just cheap headphones or 
laptop speakers, which is cool, 
but most importantly, I can 
try to sing along with them for 
the first time, testing my low-
pitched monotone voice over 
the recordings to see if I can 
deal with how it sounds.

It wasn’t long after I got my 

driver’s license that I started 
doing this. When I would drive 
home at night, I’d put on Bob 
Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” 
and crank the volume up as 
loud as it could go, screaming 
along to the lyrics with my 
scratchy, 
overjoyed 
voice, 

making an extra turn or two 
if the song was still going as I 
approached my street. “Like 
a Rolling Stone” isn’t a fun or 
happy song, but driving around 
my hometown on empty roads 
illuminated 
by 
streetlights, 

there would just be this amped-
up feeling of freedom in my 
body that I could only try to 
satisfy by attempting to merge 
with Dylan’s music, inserting 
myself into his song while 
it 
overwhelmed 
everything 

around me.

I don’t think I ever even tried 

to sing at all until I was like 16. 

I was in something resembling 
a band that was really just three 
guys in a basement playing 
music and never actually doing 
any gigs, and I was mainly 
behind the drum kit. But we 
revered punk and underground 
bands from the ’70s and ’80s. 
Those singers always sounded 
like amateurs — a rejection 
of rock star hero worship — 
so I actually wasn’t much 
worse than them, technically 
speaking. Singers like Johnny 
Rotten 
of 
the 
Sex 
Pistols 

or Calvin Johnson of Beat 
Happening had these imperfect 
voices 
that 
encouraged 
me 

to imitate them. I’d turn the 
guitar amps way up and the 
microphone way down, because 
I wasn’t comfortable hearing 
my voice as anything more than 
a kind of barely intelligible 
noise mixed in with the other 
instruments. 
But 
the 
total 

no-holds-barred cathartic rush 
you get when you have a mic 
and can make all the sounds 
you want was immediately 
intoxicating.

So it’s actually not very cool 

to scream in public, or even in 
a house when other people are 
around, but there’s a weird sort 
of privacy when you’re driving 
by yourself. You’re surrounded 
by strangers and your identity is 
shrouded by rolled-up windows. 
It’s like being in a dream — this 
transitory zone where, as long 
as you’re a good driver, nothing 
you do and nothing you think 
affects anyone but yourself. 
It’s incredible, and now I sing 
almost every single time I have 
to drive solo. Occasionally I 
worry about the person in front 
of me seeing my performance in 
their rearview, but at night or 
on an empty road, it’s absolute 
bliss.

I have a special place in my 

heart for vocalists who really 
aren’t that gifted at singing. 
I already mentioned Calvin 
Johnson, whose ridiculously 
low and unmelodic monotone 
lines up perfectly with my vocal 
chords, and Johnny Rotten, 

whose spitting British fury I 
can do a decent impression of 
under the right circumstances, 
but my favorite is Craig Finn of 
The Hold Steady. Their record 
Separation Sunday was a huge 
breakthrough for my musical 
taste, and it’s still my number 
one 
in-the-car 
CD. 
Finn 

screams himself hoarse over the 
course of the album, ignoring 
tune and melody in favor of 
just yelling these hyper-literate 
stories of kids in Minneapolis. 
The dude doesn’t even seem 
in control of his own voice, as 
it cracks and takes these odd 
turns throughout. He’s like 
an English major at a party 
trying to get your thoughts on 
Nabokov, bringing his voice up 
as loud as it can go just to make 
himself barely heard. I’m sure 
it’s ridiculous and off-putting 
to some people, but I absolutely 
love it. Finn’s voice is all about 
passion and intensity — anyone 
with a fiery belief in what he 
has to say can go up to a mic and 
sing, regardless of talent.

Music is really the closest 

you 
can 
get 
to 
inserting 

yourself into someone else’s 
artistic beauty. You can’t act 
unless someone casts you, and 
you can’t be a basketball player 
unless you make a team, but 
I can try and do exactly what 
Taylor Swift does whenever 
I put on 1989. The illusion 
doesn’t quite work, since I can 
only dream of hitting most of 
her notes, but if no one else 
can even hear me, who cares? 
Really, the ability to sing along 
is just one more magical thing 
about 
music. 
Whether 
it’s 

Lou Reed or Madonna or even 
Young Thug if you’re feeling 
super adventurous, under the 
right circumstances you can 
put on their songs, lose your 
identity for a few minutes 
and slip into someone else’s 
amazing creation.

Weird ‘Mermaid’

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

For those who watch movies as 

a form of escapism, there’s perhaps 
no 
better 

mechanism 
than the Chi-
nese 
block-

buster 
“The 

Mermaid.” 
It’s a ridicu-
lous slapstick 
fantasy/sci-
fi 
roman-

tic 
comedy, 

featuring 
a 

mermaid (newcomer Lin Yun) 
who falls in love with an environ-
mentally destructive real estate 
developer (Deng Chao, “Devil and 
Angel”) she’s been sent by her fel-
low merpeople to seduce and kill. 
Ridiculous? Yes. Entertaining? You 
betcha.

Director Stephen Chow, whose 

2004 martial arts comedy “Kung 
Fu Hustle” is nothing short of 
a masterpiece, here attempts to 
reconstruct his signature live-
action Looney Tunes style with 
mild success. “Hustle” lived up to 
its name, cracking unbelievably 
funny jokes and visual gags seem-
ingly every second. “The Mer-
maid” is equally fast-paced and, 
at a brisk 94 minutes, never slows 

down from its start.

Chow has a knack for the visu-

als. From the film’s opening incon-
gruous scene, set at a clearly fake 
museum for ocean life, Chow’s 
camera slowly reveals the absurd. 
As more and more details of the 
museum are shown, the laughs 
build and build toward one great 
punchline at the end. This is often 
how the film flows. Each scene pur-
ports to tell one major joke, and it 
deliberately lets its audience in on 
a small detail and widens the scope 
until we’re able to get the whole 
joke. It’s a tactic that works very 
well, but it limits Chow. A master 
of slapstick, Chow should start to 
expand beyond his strengths.

Let’s start with the bad. The 

effects are laughable, quite liter-
ally. In fact, it’s as easy to laugh 
at the effects as the jokes. With 
a budget of over $61 million, one 
has to wonder where much of the 
money went. And yet, to the dis-
may of visual effects engineers 
everywhere, the CGI adds to the 
charm. It takes real comedy skill 
to sell horrible effects as a positive 
attribute, but if there’s any movie 
that could do it, it’s probably this 
one. The jokes are pretty funny, 
but often they don’t work with 
each other, failing to coalesce into 
one great sequence. Instead, we’re 
left with fits and starts.

And yet, the jokes that do land 

excel wonderfully. Whether it’s 
the business executive, Liu Xuan, 
trying to describe to inept police 
officers what the mermaid looks 
like, or our hero, Shan, spectacu-
larly failing to kill the business 
executive, ludicrous comedy gold 
abounds. That latter scene, set to 
a rather apt track about invincibil-
ity, is a call back to the best scene 
of “Kung Fu Hustle,” an irrever-
ent take on accidental injury (a 
gag that Chow has developed as a 
sort of trademark). And the acting, 
which is over-the-top and hyper-
bolic, is just simply entertaining, 
like watching a face contortion 
contest.

And somehow, the film actually 

has a message. A parable about the 
environment, the film’s story fea-
tures merpeople taking revenge on 
a capitalist entrepreneur threat-
ening their ecosystem. One truly 
heart-wrenching scene, despite its 
tinge of absurdity, depicts human 
violence toward animals that can’t 
help but serve as a warning against 
whaling practices. It’s not the most 
effective movie to that end — anti-
whaling advocacy is far from its 
primary goal — but it’s hard to 
shake the environmental baggage 
from the viewing experience. And 
at the end, ultimately, it’s impos-
sible to leave without a smile.

‘Flaked’ half-baked

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

According to the New Oxford 

American Dictionary, “flake” 
can be defined as “coming or 
falling away from a surface in 
thin pieces.” 
It can also 
be used in 
the 
phrase 

“flaked out” 
to 
mean 

“to 
fall 

asleep” 
or 

“drop 
from 

exhaustion.” 
While Netflix’s newest dramedy, 
“Flaked,” attempts to themati-
cally capture the former defini-
tion, it unfortunately makes the 
mistake of embodying the latter 
one.

Filled with one-dimensional 

characters, clunky dialogue and 
half-baked ideas, “Flaked” suf-
fers the most from one of the big-
gest fatal flaws in television: it’s 
a snooze-fest. Centered around 
a self-help guru named Chip 
(Will Arnett, “Arrested Devel-
opment”) and his struggle to 
overcome his demons, “Flaked” 
searches for meaning, but comes 
up empty-handed.

For a dramedy, “Flaked” is 

more dour than funny. In the 
opening scene of the first epi-
sode “Westminster,” we hear 
Arnett’s signature gruff bari-
tone, describing his character’s 
lowest point to an Alcoholics 
Anonymous group. “I came to 
Venice by accident,” says Chip. 
“Let me reframe that — I came to 
Venice because of an accident.” 
While that line, coupled with 
Arnett’s dry execution, sets an 
engaging tone for “Flaked,” the 
episode stalls the series’ devel-
opment, wandering and drifting 
indefinitely.

The comically adept Arnett, 

known for playing memorable, 
wacky characters like Gob on 
“Arrested 
Development” 
and 

Devon Banks on “30 Rock,” has 
trouble finding an edge when 
playing Chip. Though Arnett’s 
morose portrayal of Chip is 
admirable and seems fitting in 
balancing the show’s combina-
tion of comedy and drama, his 
charisma and energetic pres-
ence, two of the actor’s greatest 
qualities, are missing. He plays a 
womanizing yet self-destructive 
recovering alcoholic, an arche-
type TV has seen one too many 
times. The character sounds 
similar to Arnett’s other current 
role as the titular anthropomor-
phic horse in “BoJack Horse-
man,” but Chip is definitely not 
as nuanced as BoJack. Chip just 
seems like an ordinary guy with 
no 
distinguishable 
qualities 

other than his sunglasses, five-
o’clock shadow and old-dude 
malaise.

Chip’s best friend Dennis 

(David Sullivan, “Primer”) is 
an unlikable and insecure run-
of-the-mill douchebag — in one 
scene, he’s actually wearing a 
popped-up collared shirt while 
riding a longboard. Dennis is 
immediately smitten with an 
attractive waitress named Lon-
don (Ruth Kearney, “The Follow-
ing”), but London falls for Chip 
instead, causing a rift between 
the two friends. While Dennis’s 
jealousy of Chip is understand-
able, his mean-spirited attitude 
makes it hard to sympathize with 
him. Regardless, neither actor 
can muster up any form of chem-
istry with Kearney, so there’s no 

real winner in this fight.

“Flaked” feels like it’s try-

ing to focus on something, per-
haps Chip’s existential crisis, 
but fails to delve deeper into the 
many layers of that concept. The 
series’ official tagline, “One step 
forward. Twelve steps back,” 
references the 12-step program 
of sobriety, yet the only direct 
mention of Chip’s alcoholism 
so far is in the show’s opening 
monologue. There’s a (some-
what forced) love triangle that 
develops between Chip, Dennis 
and London, but there’s nothing 
intriguing nor tantalizing about 
it. Read the rest of the review at

Purdue ousts ‘M’ 
after Wolverines’ 
big upset Friday

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

INDIANAPOLIS — After 

Purdue used an 8-0 run to kick 
off its Big Ten Tournament 
semifinal matchup with the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team Saturday, the Wolverines 
did 
something 
they’ve 

struggled to do this season — 
they answered back.

Sophomore 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman got Michigan’s first 
points with a layup as the 
Wolverines (10-8 Big Ten, 22-12 
overall) chipped away to keep 
things close in the first half.

But after Purdue (12-6, 26-7 

overall) started the second half 
with another run, an Abdur-
Rahkman layup rimmed out, 
denying 
Michigan 
its 
first 

points of the frame. Instead, the 
Boilermakers used a 9-0 spurt to 
widen the gap on their way to a 
76-59 win.

“Definitely 
for 
this 

tournament we wanted to come 
out and have a good start to both 
halves,” said junior guard Zak 
Irvin. “We really weren’t able to 
do that today which really put us 
in a lull, especially in the second 
half, going down as much as 16. 
It’s really tough to come back 
from that.”

All afternoon, Purdue’s big 

men used their size to bully 
Michigan’s big men in the 
paint. Junior Mark Donnal and 
sophomore Ricky Doyle were 
tasked with defending 7-foot 
center A.J. Hammons for most 
of the game, but neither could 
counter his overpowering size 
down low.

Hammons picked up 15 first-

half points, almost all courtesy 
of bodying a Michigan big near 
the basket, turning and shooting 
from point-blank range. He 
finished with a game-high 27 
points and 11 rebounds.

“Hammons is a really good 

player,” Doyle said. “He can 
finish with either hand. He was 
hitting some really tough shots 
today. The challenge is he’s is a 
big-body guy, so you knew you 
had to put that constant pressure 
on him.”

Due to the quick turnaround 

after Michigan’s Friday win over 
Indiana and no practice time, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
elected to cover Hammons 1-on-
1 instead of implementing a 
double-coverage defense.

After 
the 
game, 
Donnal 

admitted double coverage might 
have made the difference,

“Looking back on it, I think 

we probably would’ve doubled 
to probably start the game if we 
knew he was going to be hitting 
tough shots like he did today,” 
Donnal said.

In

Just two days after he hit the 

biggest shot of his college career, 
Kameron Chatman was pacing up 
and down the floor of the Weiser 
Crisler Center Club.

The 
sophomore 
forward 

knew he might have saved the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
season with his game-winning 
3-pointer to topple Big Ten 
champion Indiana in the Big Ten 
Tournament, but the Wolverines 
remained 
on 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament 
bubble 
heading 

into Selection Sunday. According 
to his teammate, junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., Chatman 
wouldn’t eat or drink as the team 
collectively awaited its fate.

But at 6:37 p.m. Sunday night, 

Michigan’s name flashed up on 
the board on CBS’s selection show 
— the Wolverines were a No. 11 
seed, headed to Dayton, Ohio, to 
play fellow No. 11 seed Tulsa as 
part of the First Four. The winner 
faces No. 6 seed Notre Dame on 
Friday in Brooklyn, N.Y.

For the second time in three 

days, many of Michigan’s players 
mobbed Chatman in celebration.

“Everybody 
almost 
tackled 

him,” Walton said. “His shot still 
means something for the season.”

The 
announcement 
was 
a 

relief to the Wolverines (10-8 Big 
Ten, 22-12 overall), who battled 
through the loss of injured senior 
guards and co-captains Caris 
LeVert and Spike Albrecht to 
still finish with 10 wins in the 
conference and four in the RPI 
top 50. 

For some Michigan players, 

that relief came a little bit earlier 

than expected, though, as the 
bracket leaked online a half-hour 
before the Wolverines officially 
popped up on the board.

Walton thinks it was junior 

guard Andrew Dakich who first 
saw the leaked bracket — which 
had already correctly predicted 
half of the field at the time it was 
discovered — and some members 
of the team began to feel more 
confident. Walton, though, wasn’t 
convinced yet.

“I 
didn’t 

believe 
it,” 

Walton said. “I 
don’t 
believe 

stuff like that 
until I actually 
see it. I’m a 
visual guy. I 
need 
visual 

proof.”

Nobody 
dared 
to 
tell 

Michigan coach John Beilein, 
who shared Walton’s skepticism 
when he found out about it a few 
minutes later.

LeVert, meanwhile, started 

checking off names on the 
leaked bracket as they were 
announced 
in 
real 
time. 

Assistant coach LaVall Jordan 
tweeted a video of the team’s 
reaction to its selection, which 
conveniently started right at the 
point where the leaked bracket 
had Michigan listed.

Meanwhile, Beilein may not 

have bought into the leaked 
bracket, but he was feeling 
hopeful on Selection Sunday 
for an entirely different reason. 
Before the team left Indianapolis 
on 
Sunday 
morning, 
Beilein 

went to 8 a.m. Mass at St. John 
the Evangelist Catholic Church. 
The 
priest, 
who 
was 
from 

Minnesota and came to the Big 
Ten Tournament, told Beilein 
after the service that he thought 
Michigan was in, claiming he 
knew a guy better than ESPN’s 
Joe Lunardi at picking the NCAA 
Tournament field.

Astonished, Beilein pointed 

to the sky and asked, “Are we 
talking about this guy?” before 
the priest laughed and dismissed 
the thought.

Whether 

it was divine 
bracketology 
or leaked news 
on 
Twitter, 

the 
team 

had 
plenty 

of 
sources 

of 
optimism 

before its name 
was 
called. 

But even though most of the 
Wolverines were starting to feel 
good about their chances, they 
didn’t need to fake the ensuing 
celebration.

Only 
seven 
members 
of 

Michigan’s 
current 
roster 

have 
experienced 
an 
NCAA 

Tournament 
run, 
making 
it 

the first taste of the Division I 
postseason for Chatman and seven 
other underclassmen. A year after 
the Wolverines stumbled to a 
16-16 record and thrust multiple 
freshmen into action due to injury, 
those same young players have 
seen their contributions result in a 
tournament berth. 

“That’s what made it a lot more 

sweet,” Walton said. “There’s 
no experience like it. You want 
everybody to experience that. ... 
(It will) give those guys times to 
experience the excitement when 
it really gets to its peak.”

Forward Boo Nieves is one of three seniors who, in his final season, has helped lead Michigan to the NCAA Tournament.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN

Michigan’s seniors who 

broke two streaks

J

acob Trouba turned pro 
after one season, Andrew 
Copp after three. Jared 

Rutledge 
played in 10 
games before 
returning to 
the United 
States Hockey 
League after 
one season. 
Daniel Milne 
played in just 
seven before 
moving back 
to Canada 
mid-season.

Boo Nieves stayed. Justin 

Selman stayed. Steve Racine 
stayed.

Of the seven players who 

entered the Michigan hockey 
program as the recruiting class 
of 2012, just those three lasted 
until the end. They suffered 
disappointment, paid their 
dues and battled when it wasn’t 
always easy. They were praised, 
then humbled, then praised 
again.

They began their careers on 

a team that ended the streak no 
one wanted to end, and they’ll 
go out ending the dubious streak 
that followed.

And on Saturday, they savored 

the reward they earned, a 
victory lap around Yost Ice 
Arena after their final home 
game. None of the other four 
— Rutledge, Milne, Trouba or 
Copp — experienced it.

“It’s too bad, because this 

is what they’re missing,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
after the Wolverines trounced 
Penn State, 
6-1, on Senior 
Night to lock 
up an NCAA 
Tournament 
bid once and 
for all.

Only Nieves, 

Selman 
and Racine 
watched as 
tributes to 
their careers 
played on the video screen 
at Yost Ice Arena. Only they 
hugged their teammates and 
coaches, one by one, before 
skating off the ice. Only 
they will enjoy what comes 
next — a long-awaited NCAA 
Tournament berth.

Only they really know what 

that means.

When they changed, 

stretched and came to their 
postgame press conference, 
a reporter asked them what 
Saturday’s win against Penn 
State meant going forward.

“We’re back in the 

tournament now, right?” Selman 
asked. “Locked in?”

Yes, Selman was assured. 

For the first time in the 
seniors’ careers, Michigan has 
clinched an NCAA Tournament 
berth. One projection, from 
College Hockey News, gave 
the Wolverines a 99-percent 
chance entering Friday and a 
99.9-percent chance going into 
Saturday.

When you’ve made the NCAA 

Tournament 22 years straight, 
maybe you can just round up. 

When you’ve missed it three 
straight, as these seniors have, 
that assumption is a little harder 
to make.

But Michigan secured the 

postseason berth the same 
way it has all season — with 
a resounding, indisputable 
demolition.

Nieves, Selman and Racine 

suffered as the first-year Penn 
State program ended their 
NCAA Tournament hopes two 
years ago. This season, they 
enjoyed retribution as they 
dominated the Nittany Lions 
in four meetings, including 7-1 
and 6-1 blowouts at Yost Ice 
Arena on Friday and Saturday, 
respectively.

Each senior stuck around 

long enough to find redemption. 
Selman scored just 13 points 
combined in his first two 
seasons. He raised his career-
high season total to 29 with two 
goals and an assist Friday and 
two more assists Saturday.

Berenson said Friday that the 

team would avoid making the 
whole week about the seniors 
playing their last home game. 
Not even the seniors themselves 
did. It didn’t strike Selman until 
after the game, when the public-
address announcer called his 
name to honor his career.

“You hear about what’s gone 

on in the four years and what 
you’ve been a part of,” Selman 
said. “It’s just so much bigger 
than yourself.”

Selman’s linemate, Nieves, 

suffered similar growing pains 
earlier in his career. Berenson 
admitted Saturday he expected 

too much 
out of Nieves 
early in the 
forward’s 
career. But 
Nieves has 
improved 
constantly, 
and he had 
the all-around 
performances 
to prove it this 
weekend.

He finished with three goals, 

played on the penalty kill for 
a short-handed goal Friday 
and won 12 out of 15 faceoffs 
Saturday. He tied his career high 
with 29 points in a season, and 
if all goes well, he’ll have plenty 
of chances to add to it in the 
coming weeks.

“Some seniors can’t get out of 

their own way on Senior Night — 
they try so hard. But Boo Nieves 
could,” Berenson said. “He got 
out of everybody’s way, and he 
was one of the best players in 
the game from start to finish.”

And then there’s Racine, who 

burst onto the stage in 2013 
when he led the Wolverines to 
the CCHA title game, where 
they almost prevented the 
22-year streak from breaking in 
the first place. Michigan entered 
the conference tournament 
needing to win it all as the No. 
7 seed, and it very nearly did. 
It swept Northern Michigan in 
the first round, upset Western 
Michigan in the second and 
stunned No. 1 seed Miami (Ohio) 
in the semifinals before falling 
to Notre Dame in the title game, 

all with Racine between the 
pipes.

But Racine has struggled to 

keep hold of the spotlight since. 
His goals-against average rose 
to 2.91 the year after, then 2.94 
the year after that. He began to 
split time with newcomer Zach 
Nagelvoort, who eventually 
became an NHL Draft pick and 
appeared at times ready to take 
over the starting job. But Racine 
won out in the end, now taking 
the team back to the NCAA 
Tournament.

Saturday, Racine turned in his 

second strong performance in as 
many nights, and with 11:51 to go 
in the game and Michigan ahead 
6-1, Berenson pulled him so that 
he could get a standing ovation 
from the crowd one last time.

But the fans weren’t done. 

Almost all of them stayed to see 
the senior class honored, right 
until the very end — just like the 
seniors themselves did.

“It’s like our fans are 

all parents of our players,” 
Berenson said. “They care 
about the players. They care 
about the seniors. They care 
about the team. I just think it’s 
a great tribute to our fans, how 
respectful they are and how 
aware they are of what’s going 
on.”

Before Michigan honored its 

three seniors individually, the 
PA announcer ran through their 
overall accomplishments from 
the past four years. Admittedly, 
they weren’t eye-popping. The 
Wolverines went 22-8-1 against 
Michigan State and Ohio State, 
with a few disappointing losses 
to underperforming rivals. 
They never made the NCAA 
Tournament, and they never 
won a conference tournament — 
each time falling one win short 
of securing an NCAA bid.

But their three seniors stayed, 

and now they have more to play 
for after they leave Yost for the 
final time.

Well, not exactly the final 

time, as Berenson pointed out.

“We’re going to be practicing 

here,” he said. “It’s not like we’re 
going away.”

By now, it’s clear going away 

just isn’t in their nature.

Michigan cruises 
on Senior Night

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

As the number of games 

remaining on the Michigan 
hockey schedule has dwindled, 
a shroud of 
uncertainty 
has 
gradually 
begun to descend upon the 
Wolverines.

Unlike in recent years, it 

hasn’t been one about their 
NCAA Tournament fate. They 
will be among the 16-team field 
— that much is certain.

Rather, 
there 
have 
been 

questions 
about 
whether 

Saturday night’s regular-season 
finale against Penn State would be 
Michigan coach Red Berenson’s 
last time behind the bench at 
Yost Ice Arena — the place he has 
called home while building an 
illustrious 32-year career as the 
program’s patriarch.

But regardless of the rumors, 

the 
Wolverines 
made 
one 

thing certain: If this was their 
coach’s last game on home ice, 
he was going out in a fashion 
emblematic of his entire career.

Behind a dominant second-

period 
effort 
and 
a 
lethal 

power-play performance, No. 
9 Michigan cruised to a 6-1 
victory against the 14th-ranked 
Nittany Lions (10-9-1-1 Big Ten, 
20-12-4 overall).

The sweep was a much-

needed result for Michigan, 
which was in the middle of a 
debilitating 
three-game 
skid 

entering the weekend.

“It’s important,” Berenson 

said. “We’ve been in different 
situations in different years. 
Sometimes 
it’s 
hard 
to 

manufacture momentum if you 
really haven’t earned it, and I 
think this team has earned it. 
We can talk about last week, 
and how we took a big step 
backwards. I thought this week 
we took a big step forward.”

Kyle 
Connor 
opened 
the 

scoring for the Wolverines (12-5-
3-2, 22-7-5) in both the first and 
second period. The two finishes 
put the freshman forward at the 
30-goal mark, and Connor is the 
first player in the nation to reach 
the milestone this year.

His second-period goal came 

in a way that has become all too 
familiar to opposing teams.

Six minutes into the frame, 

Michigan 
rotated 
the 
puck 

around its offensive zone on 
the power play until it landed 
on the stick of sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski. 

The blueliner dished a cross-ice 
pass to Connor, who fired a one-
timer past Penn State goaltender 
Eamon McAdam.

The finish gave the Wolverines 

a 4-1 lead, and they didn’t take 
their foot off the pedal for the 
rest of the contest.

Just a minute and a half 

later, with Michigan still on 
the power play, junior forward 
JT Compher lit the lamp for his 
team once more. After two shots 
by Werenski and junior forward 
Tyler Motte, the puck laid in the 
crease, inches away from the 
goal line.

Compher 
cleaned 
up 
the 

garbage 
easily, 
and 
chased 

McAdam with the goal, as the 
Nittany Lions replaced him with 
Matthew Skoff.

Though 
the 
first 
frame 

featured three goals from Connor, 
junior forward Max Shuart and 
senior forward Boo Nieves, the 
Wolverines outdid their opening 
performance 
by 
every 
other 

measure in the second.

The Wolverines closed out 

their job from there, notching one 
more goal off the stick of Nieves 
in the third period and holding 
the Nittany Lions scoreless.

The horn sounded, and the 

stands began to ring out in 
unison, “Thank you, Red!”

“Well, they’re thanking me,” 

Berenson said. “But they don’t 
know and neither do I.”

That’s the last he mentioned of 

his possible retirement.

But after the Senior Night 

presentations, Berenson exited 
the ice. He started his walk 
toward the locker room at Yost 
Ice Arena for what may be the 
final time, with a scoreboard 
looming overhead, reading 6-1 in 
favor of his team.

With every step he took, it was 

hard not to remember his lasting 
creation — a program with two 
national titles, 11 Frozen Four 
appearances, 
11 
conference 

championships and 22 NCAA 
Tournament berths.

There’s no telling if the coming 

weeks will be his last push for 
postseason hardware.

But 
if 
tonight 
was 
Red 

Berenson’s goodbye, it sure was 
a sweet one.

Connor deserves the Hobey
R

ed Berenson said 
Kyle Connor lacked 
confidence when he first 

donned the 
Michigan 
sweater. That 
was back in 
October when 
Connor was 
skating on the 
second line 
and didn’t 
even have the 
most points 
among his 
freshmen 
teammates.

But a move to the first line 

in early December changed 
the narrative, and Connor’s 
confidence is now at an all-
time high. Friday, before 
Connor could even answer a 
question on whether that’s the 
case, senior forward Justin 
Selman interrupted and agreed, 
pointing to Connor’s new 
European-style haircut as the 
only evidence you need.

With the regular season now 

over, Connor’s 61 points lead 
the nation, as do his 30 goals. 
And with another four tallies 
to cap this weekend, Connor 
has nearly perfectly positioned 
himself to win the Hobey Baker 
award — a feat only Michigan 
greats Kevin Porter (2008) and 
Brendan Morrison (1997) have 
accomplished.

There’s no question his 

numbers are astounding — his 
1.79 points-per-game average 
is the highest for a freshman 
since superhuman Jack Eichel 
registered 1.83 a game last 
season. Eichel won the Hobey 
Baker Award.

And Connor should, too.
Sure, it’s easy to chalk 

up Connor’s success to his 
linemates, juniors JT Compher 
and Tyler Motte, who boast 52 
and 50 points, respectively. And 
to some extent, that may be true. 
Compher leads the nation with 
39 assists. But Connor leads that 

three-headed monster, coined 
the CCM line.

Connor commands the 

attention, allowing room for 
his linemates and when all the 
defensive attention comes his 
way, he has no problem feeding 
Compher and Motte.

“He’s such a dangerous player 

with the puck,” Berenson said. 
“You don’t know for sure what 
he’s going to do, what he’s going 
to pull off. One thing is sure: 
If he gets a scoring chance, it’s 
going in the net. And when is 
the last time we had a 30-goal 
scorer? Let alone as a freshman.”

Porter was the last player to 

notch 30 goals in a season; he 
scored 33 times in 43 games. He 
was a senior and won the Hobey. 
Whereas Connor, just a freshman, 
has scored 30 goals while playing 
in nine fewer games.

Connor is guaranteed at least 

two more contests, and it’s not 
unreasonable that he matches 
Porter’s total in those games — 
in fact, most fans would assume 
he does just that.

Critics may say Boston College 

netminder Thatcher Demko, 
who has posted an incredible 
10 shutouts and a .939 save 
percentage, deserves the award. 
But he also benefits from one of 
the nation’s best defenses that 
has allowed 1.89 goals per game.

And while those stats 

do warrant consideration, 
the committee isn’t keen 
on handing the award to 
netminders — mind you, 
Connor Hellebuyck registered 
a mind-blowing .952 save 
percentage for UMass-Lowell 
back in 2012-13. He didn’t win 
the Hobey Baker Award.

New Hampshire’s Andrew 

Poturalski kept pace with 
Connor for much of the season. 
In 37 games, the sophomore 
notched 52 points. But much of 
that total stems from playing 
a weak schedule. And just this 
last week, Poturalski opted to 
ditch the final games of the 
season, and the last two years 
of his college career, signing a 
NHL contract with the Carolina 
Hurricanes.

Unfortunately for Poturalski, 

whose stats had him very much 
in the race for the award, the 
decision committee also takes a 
player’s character into account 
— and bolting early certainly 
shows how much regard 
Poturalski holds for college 
hockey. Sure, he was realizing 
his dream, but he could have 
waited a couple more weeks, and 
I’m confident Carolina would 
have too.

By all means, it must be 

frustrating for the committee to 
hand the award to a freshman, 
let alone having to do it two 
years in a row. Before Eichel 
won last season, Paul Kariya was 
the lone freshman to accomplish 
the feat after he had 100 points 
playing for Maine in 1992-93.

Connor’s stats mirror 

Eichel’s. Connor’s impact on 
his team is similar to that 
of Eichel’s. And he dazzles 
everyone who watches him play, 
just like Eichel.

“He’s one of those players,” 

said senior forward Boo Nieves, 
“when he gets the puck, you hold 
your breath.”

And when it comes time to 

announce the 2016 Hobey Baker 
Award Winner, Michigan fans 
shouldn’t have to hold their 
breath.

Because Kyle Connor is far 

and away the most deserving 
player to win the award.

Kyle Connor’s 61 points and 30 goals have put him up for the Hobey Baker Award.

Michigan scores in two events

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

Even after his team finished 

the 
2016 
NCAA 
Indoor 

Championships in Birmingham, 
Ala., tied for 58th place, scoring 
just two points, Michigan men’s 
track and field coach Jerry Clayton 
found a way to stay positive. 

“It’s twice as much as last 

year!” Clayton joked.

The nation’s top 16 athletes 

and top 12 relay teams were 
invited to compete at the meet. 
Senior Steven Bastien — who 
competes in the heptathlon — and 
the distance medley relay team 
were Michigan’s only athletes to 
qualify. The relay team comprised 
of junior Connor Mora in the 
1,200-meter leg, freshman Taylor 
McLaughlin in the 400-meter, 
sophomore Brennan Munley in 
the 800-meter, and fifth-year 
senior Mason Ferlic in the 1,600-
meter anchor. 

Any 
individual 
or 
relay 

that placed eighth or above 
automatically earned first team 
All-American honors. Clayton 
set a goal for the team that for 
every athlete would come back 
as an All-American. 

And the team met that bar, as 

both Bastien and the distance 
medley relay team placed eighth. 

Bastien, who transferred to 

Michigan as a junior, has set 
and re-broken the Wolverine 
heptathlon 
program 
record 

three times. He did it again this 
weekend, earning his second-
consecutive All-American honor 
and finishing with a total of 5,810 
points. That total bested his 
previous record at the Big Ten 
Championships last month. 

“I was super happy and felt 

really blessed to have it all work 
out,” 
Bastien 
said. 
“There’s 

so 
many 
opportunities 
for 

something to go wrong. I felt 
really fortunate to have this 
work out this was especially 
there with all my family and 
friends watching and to be able 
to to do it two years in a row.”

According 
to 
Clayton, 

this is the deepest and most 
competitive the heptathlon event 
— which occurs over both days of 
competition — has been since its 

start 12 years ago. 

“People 
look 
at 
(the 

heptathlon) as seven individual 
events, but it’s not,” Clayton 
said. “You have to think of it 
as one. (Bastien) has a good 
temperament 
and 
mentality 

about the event. He understands 
that you can’t be too high from 
the high or too low from the low. 
You have to move on. You want 
to use that energy and move on 
and refocus. The good (athletes) 
have 
a 
really 
good 
ability 

regardless of how the last event 
went to move on.” 

Two potential factors could 

have contributed to Bastien’s 
success. The first is that Bastien 
is 
a 
transfer 
student 
from 

Samford University, just down 
the road from the Birmingham 
Crossplex. His familiarity with 
the facility definitely did not 
hurt him, nor did it against the 
distance medley relay team — the 
indoor track and field facility in 
Ann Arbor is modeled after the 
Birmingham facility. 

Second, his dad was ranked, 

for the heptathlon, at one point 
in the top 25 internationally 
and competed at the 1984 U.S. 
Olympic trials. 

Both he and Bastien’s mom — 

natives of Saline, Mich. — made 
the trek to support their son 
in Alabama, a daunting road 
trip to say the least. In addition 
to 
Bastien’s 

parents, 
the 

Michigan 
fanbase 
was 

extensive. 

“We had a 

really 
good 

turnout 
of 

Michigan 
fans,” Clayton 
said. “It was 
real 
exciting 

to have them 
there cheering for the athletes. 
Before I came to Michigan, (the 
turnout was) something I had 
observed. It’s not typical of most 
programs.” 

Historically, 
the 
turnout 

makes 
sense. 
It 
was 
the 

University of Michigan Athletic 
Director Donald B. Canham who 
founded and served as director 
for 
the 
first 
NCAA 
Indoor 

Championships.

The distance medley relay 

team paralleled Bastien’s success 
despite an early fall in the first 
leg. The team finished in 9:37.45, 
10 seconds slower than the 
program record it had set earlier 
this year.

The 
major 

obstacle: 
Mora’s 
fall. 

An 
athlete 

ahead of the 
Wolverine 
pack stumbled 
and took Mora 
and 
three 

other 
teams 

with him. But 
out of the four 
teams 
that 

went down, Michigan was the 
only one to get competitive again. 

“It would have been easy 

to think that their dream of 
winning or finishing top three 
were gone, and it would have 
been easy for them to mail it in,” 
said Michigan assistant coach 
Kevin Sullivan. “It’s a testament 
to those guys that they didn’t.”

To make up for the tumble, 

McLaughlin 
had 
the 
fastest 

400 split time of the field. 
And, predictably, Ferlic pulled 
through in the end.

“I’m so incredibly proud of these 

guys,” Ferlic said. “In this sport, 
and in sports in general, there are 
uncontrollable circumstances and 
it’s all about how you respond and 
get back into it.

“Coming 
in, 
we 
had 

expectations to finish higher 
and I honestly believe we could 
have mixed it up with the best 
of them today, but to finish All-
American today … leaves me 
feeling very proud.”

Going forward, Clayton and 

the Wolverines have their eyes 
set on having more athletes 
compete and increasing their 
chance to place higher overall. 
Clayton is in his third year at 
the helm of the program, and he 
emphasizes that he has placed 
in the top 10 with school he’s 
coached. He thinks Michigan 
can do that, too, as it starts to 
emphasize the team rather than 
the individual awards. 

But for now, the All-American 

honors will have to suffice.

forward D.J. Wilson. But the 
Boilermakers size was too much 
for Michigan to contain.

Unable to compete in the 

paint with Purdue, Michigan 
relied on its shooting to stay in 
the game. A jumper from junior 
guard Zak Irvin tied the game 
at 21 midway through the first 
half, and a 3-pointer from junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. cut 
Purdue’s lead to single digits 
midway through the second. 
But each time, the Boilermakers 
responded 
by 
overpowering 

Michigan in the paint.

After Irvin’s jumper, Swanigan 

fed 7-foot-2 center Isaac Haas 
down low, and Haas put in 
an easy bucket over Donnal. 
Following Walton’s second-half 
3, Hammons pushed his way 
into the paint on the other end 
and drew a foul from Donnal 
— Donnal’s third of the game. 
Swanigan hit both of his free 
throws to push the Boilermakers’ 
lead back to double digits.

In the second half, Michigan’s 

shots 
stopped 
falling, 
and 

Purdue 
turned 
Wolverine 

misses into makes on the other 
end. After shooting 43 percent 
in the first half, Michigan 
struggled in the second, going 
11-for-33 from the field in the 
final 20 minutes and finishing 
6-for-25 from 3-point range.

Abdur-Rahkman 
— 
who 

scored a team-high 15 points on 
7-for-11 shooting from the field — 
was Michigan’s best option, but 
he got little help from teammates 
as the Wolverines missed seven 
of their final eight shots to close 
the game.

“We’ve been very up and down 

the last month with our shooting,” 
Beilein said. “Guys that are really 
good shooters haven’t been able 
to make shots. Now Purdue does 
have the best defense, you look at 
their stats, 3-point defense, I don’t 
care what defense it is, they’re 
the best at it, so let’s credit them 
instead. At the same time we did 
have some open looks that just 
didn’t go in.”

Ultimately, 
though, 
it 
was 

Michigan’s inability to compete 
with 
Purdue’s 
overpowering 

big men that was the difference 
in the game. The Boilermakers 
outscored the Wolverines 44-28 
in the paint and collected 15 more 
rebounds than them.

Ofili, Finn lead sixth-place finish

Michigan earns 

best place at NCAA 

Championships 

since 2008

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

Last year, senior Cindy Ofili 

fell during the preliminaries 
of 
the 
60-meter 
hurdles, 

destroying 
her 
NCAA 
title 

ambitions in the process. This 
year, a similar stumble nearly 
shattered her dream once again.

But instead, she came home 

with a national championship.

“It happened so quickly, so 

I couldn’t think,” Ofili said. “I 
stumbled, and I went straight to 
my form.”

In the preliminaries of the 

60-meter hurdles at the NCAA 
Indoor 
Championships, 
Ofili 

tripped off the block. Unlike last 
year, though, she was able to 
regain her composure and finish 
the race.

It was no certainty that Ofili’s 

run would be fast enough to 
qualify her for the final race. 
Rather, she had to anxiously 
wait for the remainder of the 
preliminary races to finish.

Fortunately for Ofili, she reset 

her form after faltering early, 
and her qualifying time gave her 
the eighth — and final — spot in 
the championship race.

“Going into the race, I knew 

once I got past the preliminary 
round, it was anybody’s game 
from 
there,” 
Ofili 
said. 
“I 

went into it with confidence, 
knowing that I’ve been in the 
national stage multiple times, 
and nothing is different. It’s just 
another race.”

This 
time 
around, 
Ofili 

didn’t have a problem off the 
block. She ran the 10th-fastest 
time 
in 
NCAA 
history 
— 

finishing in 7.89 seconds — and 
came home with the national 
championship.

With the win, Ofili garnered 

10 of Michigan’s 31 points, 
helping the Wolverines earn a 
sixth-place finish overall, their 
best since 2008.

Ofili, though, wasn’t even 

Michigan’s top contributor on 
the day.

In two distance events, junior 

Erin Finn was running near 
the 
front, 

with a shot 
at a national 
championship 
in each.

Finn wasn’t 

able to muster 
quite enough 
at 
the 
end 

of the races, 
though, 
and 

finished 
second behind 
Notre 
Dame’s 
Molly 
Seidel 

in both the 3,000-meter and 
5,000-meter runs.

Still, the races were not a 

disappointment. In the 5,000-
meter, Finn bested her indoor 
personal best by 14 seconds 

and set a new school record in 
the process. The two runner-
up finishes made Finn an All-
American in both events, and 
contributed 
a 
team-high 
16 

points to Michigan’s NCAA 
Championship cause.

“Individually, 
I’m 
very 

happy,” Finn said. “But I would 

be lying if I 
said I didn’t 
want to win. 
It 
definitely 

opened up my 
eyes a little bit 
more to show 
that I belong 
not 
just 

fighting for an 
All-American 
spot, 
but 

fighting 
for 

the 
national 
championship 

spot.”

Also earning points for the 

Wolverines was the distance 
medley 
relay 
team, 
which 

finished in fourth place with 
a time of 10:59.05 — earning 

Michigan five more points. The 
race was competitive until the 
end, but the relay team fell two 
seconds short of a national title.

“As a team it was so, so cool 

to get sixth place,” Finn said. 
“That’s as high as we were ever 
ranked all season, and that’s 
higher than we came in ranked, 
so that was very exciting. To be a 
top-10 national team, when there 
are so many schools that have 
track teams, is very, very cool.”

Despite the sixth-place finish, 

the season is only halfway over. 
This championship was just 
for the indoor portion of the 
season, and the outdoor portion 
still lasts another three months. 
For the Wolverines, resting and 
regrouping is their priority. After 
all, they certainly earned it.

“We’re going to take it down 

for a bit now,” Finn said. “There’s 
a progression of the training and 
we’re going to start all over. We 
have a good base from indoors, 
and we’re going to build on this 
come outdoor (season).”
