FUNDING HIGHER EDUCATION
Gov.:Tuitionfrez

New medium offers
tool for both classes
and recognition
By CAITLIN SCHNEIDER
Daily Staff Reporter
The booming blogosphere is
a world dominated by celebrity
gossip, confessionals and radical
opinions. But blogs are increas-
ingly hosting a new breed of user:
university professors.
In recent years, academics
across the country have started
using blogs to relay information
and ideas. Many are now incor-
porating the medium into their
classes, asking students to take to
their keyboards and post thoughts
or resources on course material.
"It's been extraordinarily suc-
cessful," said Brian Porter-Szucs,
an associate history profes-
sor, who has students blog their
responses to class readings. He
has them search for other rele-
vant material on the Interrletand
post it on the class blog.
Porter-Szucs said he decided
to include blogging in his classes
after reading one of his 15-year-
old daughter's homework assign-
ments. Porter-Szucs was alarmed
to see his daughter's writing suf-
fer as she tried to mimic what she
perceived as an academic style.
He suspected his own students
might be writing poorly for the
same reason and decided to use a

class blog to test the theory.
"My suspicions were con-
firmed," he said. "Part of the
problem wasn't necessarily that
the students didn't know how to
write, it's that they hadn't been
taught how to write effectively in
a variety of settings. If I could just
break through the sense of artifi-
ciality that came with the term
paper, I could actually get good
writing."
Communications Studies Prof.
Fara Warner, who uses blogging
in her classes, said the medium
allows students to write quickly
with relaxed prose. The class
blog also serves as a single space
in which to archive links or ideas
and facilitate class communica-
tion. Warner's personal blog is
called "The Power of the Purse,"
though she doesn't update it con-
sistently because of the amount of
time it takes to write posts.
"Blogging, for me, is a piece of
journalism," said Warner. "That,
for me, makes it a bigger task to
blog than to just throw my opin-
ion out there. I still struggle with
the immediacy of blogging and
wantingto be ethical as a journal-
ist and do right by sources and do
right by myself as well."
The time commitment means
professors need to prioritize
when it comes to blogging. Those
who write personal blogs do so
outside of their teaching require-
ments, but as blogs become more
popular, the question of their role

University to wait
for details of plan
before making a
decision
ByKYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
During her annual State of the
State address last night, Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm called on Michi-
gan's public universities not to raise
tuition rates next year.

Although details of Granholm's
proposal were not officially
announced, aides from her office
said she is expected to reward
schools that freeze tuition rates
with increased state aid and federal
funding from the stimulus pack-
age currently before the U.S. Sen-
ate. Granholm is also expected to
penalize schools that raise tuition
with decreased state funding.
In her speech, Granholm empha-
sized that increasing tuition could
result in fewer students enrolling
in college.
"As we accelerate our push to

get more kids to college, we cannot
have them priced out of the market
by tuition increases," she said. "I
am asking Michigan's universities
and community colleges to freeze
tuition for the next academic year.
No tuition hikes during this year of
economic crisis."
University Spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham issued a statement
following Granholm's comments
on a possible tuition freeze.
"We look forward to learn-
ing more details when we see the
governor's budget proposal," she
wrote.

Cunningham's statement also
said the University has made, and
will continue to make, financial aid
a major priority.
"We agree with the governor
that students and their families'
ability to access higher education is
a priority," she wrote. "This is why
we have so aggressively moved to
raise funds for financial aid during
our recent capital campaign and
why we use other strategies like
MPACT grants to help keep col-
lege affordable for students who
coptinue to demand a world-class

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Device turns words into sign

Student's technology
shows sign language
on cell phone
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
For most students, a laptop or a
college-ruled notebook is enough
to get through most lecture class-
es at the University. For hearing
impaired students, the process is
much more challenging. They need

both a translator to transcribe the
lecture and then extra time to read
through the notes once class is
over.
Using a cell phone, two Universi-
ty students have a plan to complete-
ly change the way hearinginpaired
students attend class.
Jason Gilbert and Judy Yu,
graduate students in the College
of Engineering's Department of
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space
Sciences, have developed a sys-
tem that translates sign language
into speech using cell phone

technology. They say that their
invention, Mobile Sign Language
Systems (MSigns), will revolution-
ize comrnmunication for the hearing
impaired.
"The idea behind it was to create
some software that would take spo-
ken English on any handheld device
like a smart phone and translate it
into a video of the sign language
like an interpreter you can carry in
your hand," Gilbert said. "This will
be really useful for deaf and hard-
of-hearing people who needed to

FRIDAY:
Photos of the Week

Finding a comfortable place to
browse Facebook in a dorm room
can be tough. Without wireless
Internet available in most resi-
dence halls, using the Internet
means struggling to stay plugged
in.
This isn't a concern in the
recently renovated Mosher-Jordan
Residence Hall, which is complete-
ly wireless. And once Stockwell
Hall and North Quad open they
will also be equipped with wire-
less - but what about the rest of
the dorms?
Peter Logan, University Housing
spokesman, said one of the major
challenges for installing wireless
in dorms is funding.
Logan said that University
Housing is a self-sustaining unit
with basic revenue that comes from
student room and board rates. As a

result, Housing has to prioritize
plumbing and electrical improve-
ments and heating and roofing
repairs over installing wireless.
"University Housing recog-
nizes wireless is important but it's
expensive," Logan said.
He added that it can cost sev-
eral thousands of dollars to install
wireless access points throughout
an entire residence hall, especially
in dorms like West Quad and East
Quad with complicated hallways.
"The larger and more complex
the building, the more it costs to
run wiring for the wireless access
points," Logan said. "In some halls,
existing conduit may work, in oth-
ers there have to be new wiring
channels constructed."
But the renovations of Mosher-
Jordan and Stockwell required
entire sections of walls to be taken

down, making it easy to installwire-
less as part of the reconstruction.
Though it's expensive, Logan
said Housing officials are looking
to add wireless to certain locations
in the residence halls. To help pri-
oritize prime wireless spots, Hous-
ing is working with an advisory
group within the Residence Halls
Association. This advisory group
suggested that Housing officials
should focus first on installing
wireless on North Campus.'
As of right now, one wing of Burs-
ley Hall is equipped with wireless,
and by the end of the academic year,
a second wing will be equipped,
which will constitute half of the resi-
dence hall.
Housingofficials and RHA are
also workingon installing wireless
in chief study areas in the dorms.

UNITED NATIONS
Darfur pullout
rejected by key U.N.
council members
Key U.N. Security Council mem-
bers rejected Sudanese pressure to
withdraw thousands of peacekeep-
ers from Darfur yesterday, even as
the U.S. reported a wave of govern-
ment air strikes near a rebel-held
town.
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice
said the United States is "gravely
concerned by reports of intense
aerial bombardment" - at least 28
bombing raids Tuesday morning
alone - by Sudanese forces on the
outskirts of the town in southern
Darfur.
Sudan's government on Sun-
day asked the U.N.-African Union
peacekeepers, on a mission known
as UNAMID, to leave the town
before bombing began, but U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
has said they won't go.
While Sudan has regularly chal-
lenged the U.N.'s fragile presence
in the country, the request was the
first of its kind from Sudan, U.N.
officials said. U.N. and Sudanese
officials meet in Khartoum to dis-
cuss the request, a spokeswoman
for the U.N. mission has said.

The Obama administration plans
to issue new limits on executive pay
today for companies that receive

"One of the things that that we're
going to do tomorrow is talk about
the need to control executive com-
pensation for companies that are
taking money from the federal gov-
ernment," President Barack Obama
said in an interview Tuesday with
"NBC Nightly News.
"If the taxpayers are helping you,
then you've got certain responsibili-
ties to not be livinghigh on the hog,"
the president added.
The administration will make
its announcement as congressio-
nal lawmakers work on their own
proposals to restrict compensa-
tion for companies that get money
from the $700 billion government
rescue fund. One legislative plan
would set the highest salary at a

Dow Chemical
posts $1.5B loss
in fourth quarter
Dow Chemical Co. reported a
$1.55 billion fourth-quarter loss
yesterday as a deteriorating global
economy led to a 23 percent drop in
sales and huge job cuts.
The loss was larger than expect-
ed and revenue came in below Wall
Street expectations.
"We are planning for a global
recession throughout 2009 and will
continue to take actions on manag-
ing our cash and controlling our
costs,"said Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's
chairman and chief executive.
Dow slashed operating rates
h to 64 percent in the fourth quar-
ter with demand for its products
evaporating. Diminished produc-
tion led to operating rates not seen
in more than 25 years, according to
the company.
The nation's largest chemical
maker said its loss amounted to
$L68 per share in the three months
ended Dec. 31. It had earned $472
million, or 49 cents per share, dur-
ing the last quarter of 2007.

Daschle leaves, health reform uncertain

South Dakota Sen.
will not be Obama's
HHS secretary
WASHINGTON (AP) - Tom
Daschle's decision to withdraw his
nomination as health and human
services secretary clouds hopes
that President Barack Obama
will make significant progress on
health reform in his first 100 days
in the White House.
But the problems of unafford-
able medical bills and millions of
uninsured aren't going away, and
a deepening recession has more
Americans feeling worried about
their jobs and insecure about their
health benefits.
So even if Obama's hand-picked
architect of health reform sud-
denly leaves the political scene,
the president himself still has an
opportunity to refocus the nation's
attention on its health care woes

and on his own program for mak-
ingthings better.
"It's a real blow to the effort
because Tom really was knowl-
edgeable," Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., who himself is deeply
involved in health care issues, said
Tuesday. "This is an issue I had
hoped would be a priority, and that
we could deal with it very quickly."
He added: "It hurts. It slows
things down. So this has been a
setback."
At the White House, spokesman
Robert Gibbs put on a brave front.
"I don't think the effort slows
down for health care reform, and
I think Sen. Daschle and others
would admit that the effort is far
bigger than any one individual."
"We'll miss Sen. Daschle's lead-
ership," said White House senior
adviser David Axelrod, "But this
issue has great power of its own."
Obama has a chance to recover
some lost momentumright away.As
early as Wednesday, he's expected

to sign legislation to expand health
coverage for uninsured children
of low-income working parents, a
major priority for Democrats. The
president's words at the signing
ceremony will be closely followed.
The White House has been plan-
ning a health care summit early in
the spring to kick off the health
reform campaign, but that may
now be delayed.
Obama must quickly select a
new HHS nominee who can be
confirmed smoothly. The list of
possible picks includes Kansas Gov.
Kathleen Sebelius and others with
state and national leadership cre-
dentials, including Howard Dean,
the former Democratic presiden-
tial candidate and party chairman,
Vermont governor and medical
doctor, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Ren-
dell and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland.
Not only could prospects for
health reform dim further if the
choice is delayed, but it means that
problems at HHS agencies such as

the Food and Drug Administration
could continue to fester. Agency
heads are not usually named until
a cabinet secretary is in place.
The loss of Daschle hurts Obama
in two ways. Daschle knows both
the details of health care policy
and the ways of the Senate. If a
bipartisan deal is to be struck on
health care, the best chance is in
the Senate, which is not as polar-
ized as the House.
"He brought special traits to the
job that were tremendous advan-
tages," said Judy Feder, a health
care policy expert who was a top
HHS official in the Clinton admin-
istration. "But the commitment of
the president is the key here. You
can't underestimate that."
Most health care reform advo-
cates say conditions are still favor-
able to get a bill passed. Interest
groups from insurers to small busi-
nesses, to the seniors lobby AARP
say the time has come. Key com-
mittee chairmen in the Senate and

the House remain committed.
SenateFinanceCommitteeChair-
man Max Baucus, D-Mont., whose
panel will write much of the bill, said
he's not slowing down. "It will take a
couple, three weeks at best, not alot
longer, to get health care reform leg-
islation up and ready," Baucus said.
"So this has no effects on our efforts
in the Congress."
But false starts do take their toll
in Washington. You don't get back
lost time. Other crises flare, compet-
ing for time and attention. Former
President Bill Clinton's delay in get-
ting a health care bill written and
delivered to Congress is widely seen
as a major factor in the subsequent
collapse of the legislation. And the
Obama administration has no short-
age of serious problems to confront.
Between the loss of Daschle and
continuing economic problems, "I
don't see how we get to health care
reform until the fall," said Robert
Laszewski, a policy analyst and con-
sultant for health care companies.

of October, left the downtown
Detroit facility wearing a dark
suit just after 12:30 a.m.
Before leaving the building, Kil-
patrick stood for several minutes
in the jail lobby, consulting with
lawyers and friends on the other
side of the glass front doors.
As he stepped onto the side-
walk, Kilpatrick stood for a long
moment amid bright television
camera lights, a crush of await-
ing reporters and swirling snow-
flakes, smiling occasionally to

those in the crowd who called his
name and shouted: "We love you,
Kwame. Detroit loves you, baby!"
Flanked by a number of men,
several dressed in fedoras and
long coats, Kilpatrick then was
rushed to a waiting blue Chev-
rolet Suburban. The Democrat
waved from behind tinted win-
dows as he was whisked away as
part of a multi-vehicle caravan.
Kilpatrick made no statements
to the media during his release,
upon the orders of new defense
attorney Willie E. Gary.
"He's not bitter. He said he
learned a lot," Gary said a short
time later during an impromptu
sidewalk news conference. "He
said this has been an experience
he'll never forget, and he thinks
because of it he'll be a better
person. Right now, he's just con-
cerned about getting home to his
mom, his sister, and of course his
other family.
"The former mayor ... he
wishes the city well, all the peo-
ple of Detroit well and that there
are no hard feelings one way or

the other."
It's been more than a year since
a text-messaging sex scandal first
reported by the Detroit Free Press
started the long process that
ended in Kilpatrick's disgraceful
arrest, plea, jailing and release.
Now, the man who quickly rose
from a state representative to
mayor of a city of 900,000 people
simply is looking for work.
Kilpatrick was expected to
meetwith stateprobationofficials
before heading to a job interview
Wednesday with an unnamed
company at an undisclosed loca-
tion in Texas. His wife, Carlita,
and three young sons, already
have left Michigan.
A judge has ordered that he
return by Feb. 9.
"The job prospect is very, very,
very favorable," Gary told report-
ers. "We want to make sure he can
get, and land, the job. That's his
first thing. He wants a job. That's
what he is concerned about now.
He wants to get with his family,
get with his kids so he can start
his life again."

Bridge in Khyber
Pass collapsed from
explosion
KABUL (AP) - U.S. troops in
Afghanistan saw their supply lines
squeezed from the north and east
Tuesday after militants blew up
a bridge in Pakistan and Kyrgyz-
stan's government said it would end
American use of a key air base fol-
lowing Russia's announcement of
new aid.
Securingefficient and safe supply
routes into Afghanistan has become
a top priority for U.S. officials as the
Pentagon prepares to send in up to
30,000 more American soldiers
this year. Some 75 percent of U.S.
supplies travel through Pakistan,
where militants have stepped up
attacks on truck convoys destined
for U.S. bases.
Attackers yesterday blew up a
bridge in northwestern Pakistan in
a fresh salvo in an escalating cam-
paign seeking to cripple Washing-
ton's war effort in Afghanistan.
The red metal bridge in the Khy-
ber Pass partially twisted and col-
lapsed on one end, with chunks of
concrete scattered about. A trailer
truck caught on the span - about 15
miles northwest of Peshawar - fell
on its side and spilled dozens of bags.
While U.S. officialshavelongsaid
they are seeking fresh supplyroutes,
they have never hinted publicly at
any concern about running out of
food or fuel. American forces stock-
pile enough supplies to last 60-90
days in the event that their supply
chain is severed, U.S. officials say.
The top U.S. military spokes-
man in Afghanistan shrugged off
any supply worries after Tues-
day's events, saying that traffic
was already flowing again in Paki-
stan after the attack. "They made a
bypass," said Col. Greg Julian.
He also dismissed Kyrgyzstan's
threat to close access to the Manas
air base as nothing but "political

positioning." Gen. David Petraeus,
who oversees the wars in Afghani-
stan and Iraq, met with officials in
Kyrgyzstan last month and "came
away with the sense that every-
thing was fine," Julian said.
"We have a standing contract,
and they're making millions off our
presence there. There are no plans to
shut down access to it anytime soon,"
Julian told The Associated Press.
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Mor-
rell said: "I have seen nothing to
suggest, other than press reports,
that the Russians are attempting to
undermine our use of that facility."
Pentagon planners and logistics
officers have a variety of alterna-
tive supply routes into Afghanistan,
although defense officials acknowl-
edged that Manas is singularly
important.
"There are other ways to resupply
via air or land if need be, but Manas
is well situated, it's well-appointed,
it's well run and it well serves our
troops in Afghanistan," Morrell
told The Associated Press. "We
think it's in everybody's interest to
continue our operations there."
Petraeus, chief of the U.S. mili-
tary's Central Command, said
last month that agreements had
been reached to use supply routes
through Central Asia, but details of
the deals have not been announced.
Kyrgyzstan President Kurman-
bek Bakiyev's statement that U.S.
forces would have to stop using
Manas air base came after Russia
said it was providing the poor Cen-
tral Asian nation with billions of
dollars in aid.
The Kyrgyz government "has
made the decision on ending the
term for the American base on the
territory of Kyrgyzstan and this
decision will be announced tomor-
row or the day after," Bakiyev said
in televised comments.
The United States set up the
Manas base and one in neighboring
Uzbekistan to back operations in
Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 ter-
ror attacks.

Chrysler sales plunge 55

Killefer withdraws

percent; GM, Toyota down bid for Obama post,

Automakers hurt by
unemployment and
tough credit market
DETROIT (AP) - Chrysler's
U.S. vehicle sales plunged 55 per-
cent in January, while General
Motors' tumbled 49 percent and
Ford's dropped 40 percent, start-
ing 2009 at an abysmal pace for the
whole auto industry as lower sales
to fleet buyers like rental car com-
panies weighed down the results.
Toyota's sales dove 32 percent
for the month, Nissan's dropped
30 percent and Honda's fell 28
percent, putting the overall indus-
try on track for its fourth straight
month in which U.S. sales plunged
30 percent or more.
But Subaru bucked the trend
of declines for a second month in
a row, posting an 8 percent sales
increase, and Hyundai said its
sales jumped 14 percent.
Hyundai credited its increase
to its offer to cover a new vehicle's
depreciation if customers return a
car within 12 monthsbecause they
are unable to make the payments.
"This program gets to the root
cause of today's economic con-

cerns - fear of job loss," Hyundai
regional general manager Peter
DiPersia said in a statement.
Chrysler's sales chief, Steven
Landry, told reporters yesterday
at a meeting with dealers that
U.S. industry sales could drop as
much as 35 percent in January.
The annualized sales rate for the
month could drop below 10 mil-
lion for the first time in more than
26 years, he said.
According to Ward's AutoIn-
foBank, the last month in which
the seasonally adjusted annual
sales rate dropped below 10 mil-
lion was August 1982, when it
hit 9.9 million as the nation was
mired in a recession.
Domestic and foreign auto-
makers have been struggling as
unemployment rises, consumer
confidence weakens and many
people have a tougher time get-
ting loans. General Motors Corp.
and Chrysler LLC have received
$13.4 billion in federal loans to
stay afloat, and they hope to get
more after they submit a viabil-
ity plan to the government by
Feb. 17. Ford Motor Co. has said
it does not plan to use govern-
ment aid.
GM said earlier this month it is

planning its turnaround under the
assumption the entireindustry will
sell 10.5 million new vehicles in the
U.S. this year. Chrysler has said it's
planning on 11.1 million units, and
Ford last week reduced its forecast
to a range between 11.5 million and
12.5 million. But few people were
expecting the automakers to start
2009 at such a pace.
January is typically a slow sales
month, and many automakers and
analysts are expecting the mar-
ket to rebound in the second half
of the year as the economy and
access to credit improves.
Detroit-based GM sold 128,198
light vehicles in January, while
Ford's sales totaled 93,060 and
Chrysler sold 62,157. Toyota Motor
Corp. sold 117,287 cars and trucks.
The automakers have rolled
out hefty incentive offers to boost
sales. Edmunds.com estimated
the average automaker incen-
tive at $2,714 per vehicle sold in
January, down 5.2 percent from
December but up 12.5 percent'
from January 2008.
Jesse Toprak, the auto Web site's
executive director of industry anal-
ysis, attributed the year-over-year
increase to a greater number of lin-
gering2008 model year vehicles.

citing unpaid taxes

Chief performance
officer nominee
owed $946.69 to IRS
WASHINGTON (AP) - Nancy
Killefer withdrew her candidacy to
be the first chief performance offi-
cer for the federal government on
yesterday, saying she didn't want
her bungling of payroll taxes on her
household help to become a distrac-
tion for the Obama administration.
Killefer was the second major
nominee to withdraw.Within hours,
former Sen. Tom Daschle also with-
drew his nomination to be secretary
of health and human services.
In a brief letter to President
BarackObama,Killefer,theSS-year-
old executive with consulting giant
McKinsey & Co., wrote that she had
"cometo realize inthe current envi-
ronment that my personal tax issue
of D.C. unemployment tax could
be used to create exactly the kind
of distraction and delay" that must
be avoided in responding to urgent
economic problems.
She offered no further details of

her tax difficulties.
In announcing his choice of Sen.
Judd Gregg to be commerce sec-
retary, Obama took no questions
Tuesday and left the White House
lectern ignoring a shouted question
about why so many of his nominees
have tax problems.
But White House press secretary
Robert Gibbs later insisted Killefer
and Daschle decided on their own to
withdraw. "I think they both recog-
nized that you can't set an example
of responsibility but accept a differ-
ent standard in who serves," Gibbs
told a White House briefing.
When Hillefer's selection was
announced by Obama on Jan. 7,
The Associated Press disclosed
that in 2005 the District of Colum-
bia government had filed a $946.69
tax lien on her home for failure
to pay unemployment compensa-
tion tax on household help. Since
then, administration officials have
refused to answer questions about
the tax error, which she resolved
five months after the lien was filed.
It wasn't clear whether theadmin-
istration was aware of Killefer's tax
errorsbefore Obama named her.

Calling for tough cuts
Granholm's efforts to balance state budget are critical
L ast night, Gov. Jennifer Granholm delivered her annual
State of the State address from the floor of the Michigan
House of Representatives. With the federal stimulus pack-
age - which could fund many state programs - facing an uncer-
tain future, Granholm focused on several major suggestions to
reduce the state budget. She also implored state universities to
freeze tuition for the upcoming school year. These efforts to pre-
vent an increase in college tuition costs are necessary to provide
for the state's economic revival, which hinges upon establishing
an educated workforce. With this goal in mind, Granholm's bud-
get cuts should be adopted, and the state must work with univer-
sities to keep the price of a Michigan education low.

A stimulating solution

During her address, Granholm suggested
massive budget changes to counter the defi-
cit predicted for the upcoming fiscal year.
When the new fiscal year starts on Oct. 1,
Michigan's budget is anticipated to be short
a staggering $1.6 billion. In response, Gra-
nholm suggested cutsto state agencies across
the board, which would mean eliminating 10
of 16 state departments and funding for the
state fair. She also requested that the State
Officers Compensation Commission, which
sets salaries for elected officials, cut salaries
by 10 percent.
Though these cuts will probably mean job
losses for some state employees, they are
nonetheless necessary so that the state can
control its budget. Now, more than ever, the
state needs to decide which expenditures are
vital to the well-being of the state - and cut-
ting education funding just isn't acceptable.
The state needs higher education to be acces-
sible and affordable to diversify Michigan's
economy with a workforce well educated in
a variety of academic fields.
Cuttingstate departments is vastly prefer-
able to the 7.1 percent across-the-board cut to
public university funding that was suggested
last month. These cuts, in conjunction with
other plans to save money in the state's cor-
rections system, will hopefully prevent the

state from cutting education funding.
And if the state is able to avoid cutting
education funding, these universities will
be more prepared to heed Granholm's call to
freeze tuition rates. Considering that tuition
here at the University has increased 34.6
percent in the last four years alone, an end to
the constantly increasing rate would bewel-
come to college students and their families.
But this becomes an impossible goal to. live
up to if the state ends up slashing education
funding. Granholm said that if colleges can
freeze tuition rates, the state will reward
them with funding. The University should
feel compelled to take her up on this offer.
In her discussion of the state's finances,
Granholm also mentioned the pending fed-
eral stimulus package. She noted that, while
there are projects that could benefit from
the federal aid, the stimulus package isn't a
cure-all for Michigan's problems.'And she's
right - the federal stimulus package mak-
ing its way through Congress is an uncertain
prospect. And, no matter how much money
Michigan gets, it won't solve our overarching
budget problems in the longterm.
If our options are between cutting funding
to higher education and scaling back on non-
essential spending, we would much rather
sacrifice the state fair.

The word "stimulus" always
makes me giggle. It just sounds
dirty to me. But despite the
fact that I never left
puberty, the stimu-
lus everyone is talk-
ing about today is
hardly a dirty joke.
In fact, it's probably
the nation's great-
est hope for salvag-
ing the economy.
Last Wednesday, M
the House of Rep- ATTHEW
resentatives passed GREEN
President Obama's
economic stimulus
package. Supporters and critics alike
have deemed it one of the largest
social spending programs since the
New Deal. Its basic tenets include vast
increases in funding for education
and Medicaid, more unemployment
benefits and the creation of public
works projects to secure employment
for millions of Americans.
In addition, the stimulus sets aside
funding for increased broadband
access, alternative energy investment,
financial assistance for college stu-
dents, infrastructure repair and health
care for blue-collar workers. It also
protects unemployed Americans from
losing their health care coverage.
In hopes of appealing to conserva-
tives, Obama pressured Democrats
to exclude a measure that would
make contraceptives more accessible
through Medicaid. Contraceptives
help many families stay afloat and
serve as a crucial element of family
planning. Failing to aid families with
this is an unfortunate means of com-
promise.
Nevertheless, close-mindedness
has compelled conservatives to ignore
the Democrats' concessions. Many
believe the package should focus on

things they view tobe more pertinent
to the economy. What they fail to rer-
ognize is that investing in the afore-
mentioned programs is investing in
the economy..
ProvidingAmericanschools withthe
resources to better educate American
students will lead to a more intellectu-
al workforce. Maintaining affordable
health care will inevitably result in
more people staying healthy and work-
ing more efficiently. Focusing on alter-
native energy will probably help save
domestic industry and simultaneously
rescue the environment in which all of
us work and live. And similar realities
are to be found for each individual part
of the stimulus.
"Well, fine," Republicans might
say, "lots of fancy new programs -
but there aren't enough tax breaks
for 'real Americans.'" In fact, a third
of the stimulus package goes back to
taxpayers in need in the form. of tax
breaks. But it's important to note that
in spite of what conservatives might
say, tax cuts alone are simply not the
answer.
The purpose of a tax cut is to
encourage taxpayers to spend more
at businesses affected by the failing
economy. But at a time when credit is
at a virtual standstill and people are
increasingly nervous about spending,
what little they have, money unspent
in taxes would likely be saved rather
than reinvested into struggling busi-
nesses. Thatmeansmajor cutsintaxes
at this point in time would decrease
government revenue while doing
nothing to help moribund businesses,
in effect making things worse.
To illustrate this point Congress
enacted amoreconservativeapproach
last year to an economic stimulus
program by passing a $168 billion tax
cuts and rebates package. That was
in February 2008. Are we more eco-

nomically sound in February 2009, or
were Americans once again duped by
the myopic social philosophy of the
far right?
To be fair, when discussing public
policy and especially economic poli-
cies, it's important to look carefully
at both sides. When members of both
parties have dissenting opinions in
Congress, representative democracy
is playing its 'A'-game and coming
closer to a holistic middle ground. But
when those opinions yield only bitter
argument - and no results - then the
process is entirely undermined.
Stimulus - it may
sound naughty,
but it's needed.
The House did manage to pass
Obama's stimulus plan, so any further
discussion might seem like a non-
issue. But it passed without a single
Republican vote, and the stubborn-
ness exhibited by House Republicans
scares me. It's a powerful pigheaded-
ness and it must not continue into the
future. There are too many important
bills to pass for partisanship to get in
the way of professionalism.
Regardless of whether or not
everyone on Capitol Hill agrees with
the current terms of the stimulus
package, policy gridlock will get the
U.S. nowhere. That much is clear. If
liberals are willing to come to the
table ready to bargain, Republicans
ought to do the same.

MSAs Band-aid solution

If any students were still unconvinced of the
ineptitude of the Michigan Student Assembly,
Monday night's Town Hall Meeting has surely
convinced them. Setting the tone for the night
was yet another laughable tirade against the
"Zionists" allegedly in control of MSA and, by
extension, U.S. foreign policy. What followed was
as equally detached from reality; MSA and other
student government leaders took questions from
a small audience of about forty people (comprised
mostly of those already in student government),
assuaging their concerns with nothing more than
recycled and unfulfilled campaign promises.
MSA has spouted a lot of rhetoric of late regard-
ing "accountability," but this is not it.
Over the past week, MSA's Gaza resolution
debacle has brought on a deluge of coverage
detailing its shortcomings, but none were as tell-
ing as Monday's Letter to the Editor (Student
government leaders to hold Town Hall Meeting,
02/02/2009) penned by none other than the
presidents of MSA, LSA Student Government
and the University of Michigan Engineering
Council: Sabrina Shingwani, Leslie Zaikis and
Danny Hsiao, respectively. The central thesis of
their letter seems to be that better communica-
tion with students will lead to more effective
student governments. On the surface, this is hard
to disagree with. A dialogue with constituents is
essential for an efficient government, student or
otherwise.
The problem is that it's completely insincere.
If MSA truly wanted transparency, it might con-
sider updating its website. The most recently
listed meeting minutes and resolutions are a full
11 months out of date. Likewise, this letter would
seem to be the extent of MSA's advertising for the
town hall meeting. Where was the mass email?
Where were all the flyers? A meeting with the
public doesn't work if the public doesn't know
where or when to meet.
The letter goes on to play one of the oldest
(and, incidentally, least effective) cards in the
political deck - blaming the media. The authors,

in an attempt to shirk responsibility for their
administrations' lack of transparency, compares
MSA to NASA. She claims that, like NASA, only
MSA's failures are publicized while their suc-
cesses go unnoticed. While comparing MSA to a
U.S. government agency is an interesting attempt
at implying legitimacy, the comparison is ridicu-
lous. If this is truly the case, then I challenge the
student governments to explain.why every robot
that gets shipped off to Mars is front-page news.
IfMSA is hurting for some positive press, it has
no one to blame but itself. Sure, not everything
MSA does right will make the papers. But with
a budget of hundreds of thousands of dollars,
the lack of newsworthy projects or initiatives is
simply a disgrace. The letter from the presidents
exposes the "town hall meeting" for what it real-
ly was - not an opportunity for real feedback,
but rather a public relations band-aid to stem the
recent bleeding only long enough for inevitable
student apathy to kick back in.
So how do we fix MSA and finally restore
accountability to student government? The
solution is quite simple - we must rid our-
selves of the single-party system. That means
we need an alternative to the Michigan Action
Party. Despite years of stagnation and scandal
(remember Zack Yost and Anton Vuljaj?), and
the same unfulfilled campaign "promises" each
semester, MAP continues its single-party reign
over student government. Without another
party in serious contention, voters cannot oust
the ineffectual party from office. Consequently,
our elections have become just about as mean-
ingless as North Korea's.
If there is any real leadership left in student
government, your mandate is clear. Break off
from your party bosses and forge into the future
under a new banner. The voters will reward
you. Until you do, your "town hall meetings"
will remain nothing more than "Tammany
Hall Meetings."

Nas brings his
rhymes to EMU

"'m Jason Bourne in 20 years."
indleM ssthrill

By JEFF SANFORD
DailyArts Writer
Ladies and gents of the University, roll
your blunts up tight; dust off those old
bottles of Moet and Alize; and please,
for God's sake, put away
that tired, auto-tuned NaS
hip hop. Nas is here.
Well, not yet. But Friday,
this Friday, acclaimed 7:30 p.m.
rapper Nas will be per- Atthe EMU
forming just down the Cunvocation
road at Eastern Michi- Center
gan University's Con- $35 and $45
vocation Center.
In 1994, Nas debuted
with the now-legendary album Illmatic.
Ever since, he has been a titan of the
hip-hop industry, maintaining a repu-
tation as the rap game's poet laureate.
Considering the elaborate rhymes and
abundant literary allusions sprinkled
generously throughout his songs - not
to mention his beautifully poignant ren-
derings of inner-city life - the title is
hardly unwarranted.
Yet in the 15 years since his debut, his
career hasn't been all handshakes and
backrubs. From pestering accusations
of selling out to his involvement in one
of hip hop's most notorious feuds (with
fellow rap elite Jay-Z), Nas has seen his
share of drama. But he and Jigga have
long since made amends, and his recent
street-consciousworkhas allbutsilenced
the critics. His name remains one of the
most revered in hip hop today.
Nas is not one to settle into compla-
cency, and his cushy throne at the head
of the rap kingdom hasn't made him shy
away from controversy. His most recent
LP, released in July, was originally sup-
posed to be titled Nigger. But after a furi-
ous shit-storm of uproars from various
retailers and high-profile personalities
like Reverend Jesse Jackson, the album
was simply re-titled Untitled, with Nas
remarking: "The people will n always
know what the real title of this album
is and what to call it." Still, it proved to
be an epic call-out of a record - slam-
ming FOX News, belittling George W.
Bush and successfully predicting Barack
Obama's rise to the presidency. The
reviews weren't bad either, with a four-
star review from Rolling Stone and a
prestigious four-and-a-half out of five
rating from The Source.
Performing with Nas on Friday are
Royce Da 5'9", hip-hop collective Street

Justice and rapper Johnny Saxx. Native
Detroiter Royce has a history in the rap
game stretching back to 1997, when he
and Eminem collaborated and released
several tracks together. After some sig-
nificant buzz early on, a brief prison sen-
tence hampered the young rapper's rise
to fame. But now he's out and looking
again to break into the mainstream with
the upcoming March release of his fifth
album, Street Hop.
Also Detroit locals, Street Justice and
Johnny Saxx have The D in their hearts
and aim to bring Motown back into the
hip hop limelight. Undoubtedly, theywill
shine in front of the hometown crowd
Friday. The Michigan Dance Team will
also accompany all acts on stage.
It's not every day that a living legend
comes to town. And Nas truly has the
credentials to be considered, as the pro-
One of hip-hop's
most revered artists
hits Ypsilanti.
motion for the show not-so-farfetched-
ly calls him, "One of the five greatest
emcees of all time."
Contrary to the title of Nas's 2006
effortHipHop isDead, hip hopisunques-
tionably alive. And on Friday, the evi-
dence will be indisputable to those who
make it out to the Convocation Center.
For Michigan students, free bussing
will be provided to and from the show
with proof of an MCard. Buses will leave
from the Michigan Union for the Convo-
cation Center at 7 p.m. After the- show,
buses will be running back to the Union
and to popular bars and clubs around
Michigan's camnus.

With Liam Neeson
onboard, this run-of-the-
mill action flick manges
to get most things right
By SHERI JANKELOVITZ
Daily Arts Writer
"Taken" appears to be an above-aver-
age action film - until you start thinking
about it. Now, thinking,
about an action film is
never a particularly good
idea because it's probably Taken
full of holes, and "Taken"
is no exception. At Showcase
Bryan Mills (Liam and Quality 16
Neeson, "Batman 20th Century Fox
Begins") is a retired
government agent try-
ing desperately to live a normal life so he
can get to know his daughter Kim (Maggie
Grace, "The Fog"). His former job drove
him to paranoia, so naturally he's opposed
to Kim jetting off with a friend to spend

her summer in Paris. Sure enough, when
they go, Kim and her friend are abducted
by a gang of Albanians faster than Mills
can say, "I told you so."
It's up to Mills to tear through Paris
until he finds his daughter, who appar-
ently has been sold into sexual slavery.
He's given only 96 hours to find her, which
explains why he's never seen eating,
showering or even sleeping. In fact, Mills
doesn't seem to need to participate in any
of these human practices;'he acts more like
Robocop or The Terminator than a flesh-
and-blood person. But he's surprisingly
effective at what he does, considering that
all the evidence he has to work with is a
string of convenient coincidences.
When it comes to action, "Taken" defi-
nitely delivers. There are car chases, fist-
fights and ample explosions. The action
scenes are also blissfully short so there's
no opportunity for them to get boring. Like
any action film, the bad guys are sniveling
weasels - caricatures whose departures
won't be mourned by anyone, least of all
the audience. The film is less about these
bad guys (none are even given names) and
more about Neeson simply wreaking havoc

on everything in his path. The man is sur-
prisingly limber for his age; perhaps more
action films will be in his future.
But then, inevitably, come the ques-
tions. How exactly is Mills not in any sort
of trouble for the fact that he has destroyed
a ton of Parisian property and killed doz-
ens of bad guys, all on his own? What
exactly is this government conspiracy he
has stumbled upon? And who keeps hiring
these henchmen? Obviously, nobody has
been teaching them how to win a firefight:
they can't hit the broad side of a barn, and
yet they're defeated by the hero with one
bullet. They could use some practice in a
shooting gallery.
While the film is undeniably ridiculous,
it's hard to nitpick, except when it comes
to the preposterously happy ending. With-
out giving it away, there is simply no way
everything could return to normal after
what transpires before the mushy conclu-
sion. Like everything else in the movie, it's
best to simply accept the flawed finish.
Like most action films, "Taken" has its
fair share of problems. And though it may
be all action and little brains, it still gets the
job done. Just don't think too much into it.

or who are uncomfortable with
their sexual orientation or gen-
der identity may find the prospect
of entering the Spectrum Center
or attending an LGBT student
group meeting to be too risky or
intimidating," Correa said. "Some
may fear being seen by others and
being identified as LGBT, some
may not be ready to be around a
group of LGBT people."
Correa said the new program
is being launched as a response to
previous insufficient support pro-
grams for students.
"We've found that existing
coming out support resources
were insufficient," he said. "We
needed a new way to support stu-
dents going through a difficult
time."
After filling out a confidential
online request form, students will
be matched with a GPS student

mentor by a GPS coordinator. The
student and the GPS mentor will
be pairedbased on shared identi-
ties and backgrounds.
Correa said the program is
designed to benefit students who
are coming out, and also the stu-
dents who are providingsupport.
"It's also a great way for stu-
dents who already have experi-
ence with coming out to give back
to their community by helping
others going through a situation
they might have been through,"
he said.
Correa said the main goal of
GPS is to provide a program for
students who are coming out to
feel more at ease with their sexual
identities.
"We hope to give students a
new tool to use as they are navi-
gating their way out of their
closet," Correa said. "I-opefully,
the program will help students
struggling with their identity
to feel more comfortable with
themselves."

education from the University of
Michigan."
Cunningham did not respond
to whether the University would
agree to freeze tuition or whether
it would raise tuition next year,
but said the University is currently
working on its budget for next year.
"We're in the early stages of
developing next year's budget,
which typically is presented to
the Board of Regents in June," she
wrote.
Mike Boulus, leader of the Pres-
idents Council, State Universities
of Michigan - the body that rep-
resents the presidents of Michi-
gan's public universities - told
the Associated Press that a tuition
freeze without increased state
funding would be "a tough pill to
swallow."
"We're being cautious right
now," he said. "We would have to

communicate on the spot and
didn't have a professional inter-
preter with them at the time."
Gilbert and Yu began working
on MSigns in January 2006. They
entered their idea in a program at
the Digital Media Commons in the
Duderstadt Center, which awards
cash grants to students who sub-
mit project ideas that incorporate
digital media.
Gilbert, who is fluent in sign
language and Yu, who has comput-
er-programming experience, col-
laborated to develop the project.
As an undergraduate student
at Brigham Young University, Gil-
bert worked as a sign language
translator to help pay his tuition
bills. He said many deaf and hear-
ing-impaired people told him they
preferred sign language to writ-
ten speech because it was easier to
understand.
Gilbert realized it was pos-
sible to create an application for a
smart phone, which would trans-
late speech into a video image of
sign language.
"We'd like it to be something
you can use on your phone like
more along the lines of a Google
app, or an iPhone app or an add-on
program to an install phone plan
- or even a service you could use
on the Internet," he said.
While a few products exist
that can translate speech to sign
language, they are expensive -
including the iCommunicator,
which costs $6,500.
"It's out of the range of the
everyday person, and that's who
we want to bring this to," he said.
Though the MSign's technol-
ogy isn't currently compatible
with cell phones, it's designed to
work with PC computers. Gilbert
and Yu said they plan to develop
a model the public can use within
the next month and distribute the

to exceed their goal of 1700 pints
of blood.
Talpos said he thinks donating
blood is one of the most charitable
things a person can do.

"It seems to me so simple," he
said. "There is no reason people
should be dying for lack of blood.
It's a way we can help someone
out without having to receive any-
thing in return."

hear more about the details."
Last year, Granhom asked
state universities to limit tuition
increases to the rate of inflation
- then 2.3 percent. In exchange,
Granholm had planned to
increase state funding to the uni-
versities by 3 percent, but the leg-
islature reduced the increase to 1
percent.
The University has raised
tuition every year for the past
nine years. Increases have ranged
from a 2.8- percent increase in
2000 and 2004 to a 12.3-percent
increase in 2005.
The University raised tuition
by 5.6 percent last year, when
the state's 15 public universi-
ties averaged a 7 percent tuition
increase.
Granholm's entire plan will
become public next week when
she submits her budget proposal
to the state legislature.

product by next fall.
Ina later version of the technol-
ogy, Yu said that using a camera
phone, the goal is to develop the
product to translate sign language
into words.
Currently, the program can
only translate English into sign
language, ut Yu said she intends
to add more languages.
"Sign language, like spoken lan-
guage, is different in every coun-
try so we'd have to basically redo
the whole process with another
set of vocabulary," Yu said. "It's
certainly something to think of
but (English speakers) are by far
the largest sign language commu-
nity right now."
To film their current prototype,
Gilbert and Yu used the Motion
Capture Studio at the University's
3D laboratory to record the videos.
"We really want to doa motion
capture version of sign language
rather than just video taping
a human," he said. "We think
there's a lot we can do with the
digital data in the long run."
So far, deaf and hearing-
impaired high school students
who attended a College of Engi-
neering summer program have
been involved in the testing of
MSigns.
"They were excited to see it,"
Yu said. "It wasn't the perfect
solution because it only does one
way right now, but they were glad
to see there was something being
developed that was targeted for
them because that doesn't happen
very often."
Yu said she hoped MSigns will
have a positive impact on the edu-
cation and employment prospects
for the hearing impaired.
"Transcribers, when they
take notes for the students, it's
still pretty difficult for hearing
impaired students to interact
inside a classroom or with stu-
dents," she said. "We want to fill
that gap so they can more fully
integrate into society."
Talpos also stressed the impor-
tance of donating blood despite
the snow and cold.
"In the cold winter months, we
get a lot less peoplebecause people
are less likely to leave their hous-
es to donate," he said. "We could
really use aslot more people show-

ing up because there is always a
blood shortage."

and times to donate blood for

in academic research and publish-
ing becomes more complex.
Mark Perry, an associate profes-
sor of economics and finance at the
University's Flint campus, is a self-
described "slave" to his economics
blog, "Carpe Diem." Perry said he
spends up to five hours a day mak-
ing various posts to his blog and
thinks there is a place for blogging
in the duties of a university profes-
sor, albeit an evolving one.
"It's so new that (universities)
haven'tquite incorporatedityetinto
the three areas that we're respon-
sible for - teaching, research and
service," Perry said. "But it really
kind of overlaps in all those areas."
Perry said he believes that blog-
ging could be considered applied
research.
But in an interview, University
Provost Teresa Sullivan said that
blogging lacks an important ele-
ment, which generally elevates the
credibility of a publication: peer
review.
"Peer review is an important
quality marker," said Sullivan.
"With electronic media now, any-
body can publish anything."
While the University doesn't
view blogs as a form of official
research or publishing, Sullivan
said she encourages professors to
use them, even if they express con-
troversial opinions or ideas.
"That's what universities are
about," Sullivan said. "The univer-
sity is the place where you're free
to put ideas out there, and we're
tolerant of other people's ideas but
it also means you've got to be ready
for somebody to go after you and
attack your ideas."
That open door for comments
adds a dynamic element to blogs,
which can further strain bloggers-
who take the time to edit readers'
posts. Harvard University Econom-
ics Prof. Greg Mankiw has removed
the comment feature altogether from
his economics blog.
History Prof. Juan Cole writes
what is probably the most well-
known of University of Michigan
professors' blogs as well as the most
controversial. His blog "Informed
Comment,". focuses on the Middle

Communication Studies Prof. Fara Warner works on her laptop during office hours at Starbucks on South University yesterday.

East and has received both posi-
tive and negative critical attention.
Cole said most of his students know
about his blog, and he references it
in class but doesn't make it part of
the curriculum.
"I don't do my blog as part of my
university duties," Cole said. "I do it
on my private time. For that reason,
I can sometimes be a little more
political."
With his blog, Cole has gained
recognition as an expert on the
Middle East and gets at least
800,000 visits a month.
While many professors anchor
their posts in facts and data, others
employ a less journalistic style and
write on topics outside their aca-
demic expertise.
Engineering Prof. Thomas Zur-
buchen writes a blog through the
Center for Entrepreneurship web-
site, though his content generally
addresses subjects other than his
academic specialty.
"The vast majority of topics are

about things other than engineer-
ing," Zurbuchen said. " feel it's
important to recognize as an engi-
neer that we have to learn how to
recognize the impact that we can
make, and see opportunity and
adjust to change. Engineering is not
just engineering, it's about much
more than that, and it requires
skills in many other areas."
Regardless of how this niche
of the blogging world evolves, the
trend shows no sign of slowing. Uni-
versity Librarian Paul Courant, who
is also a Public Policy professor and
author of the blog "Au Courant,"
said the trend is a positive thing.
"I actually think it's very good
if professors talk or convey their
views less formally to a broader
audience than we do in our formal
research publications," said Cou-
rant. "So I very much like the idea
that members of our. faculty use
their expertise in the wider world."
Blogs considerably raise the pro-
file of University professors, which

is good for the University. Through
their archive of posts, professors
advertise their expertise in a given
field. Establishing that authority
leads calls from the media - and
the University's appearing in print.
Perry used himselfas an example
of what blogs can do to elevate an
instructor's status, saying a Google
search of his name yields substan-
tially more results than University
President Mary Sue Coleman. Cole-
man's name generates 246,000
results while Perry's name registers
more than 2,620,000 results.
"Someone like Mary Sue Cole-
man, who has a very high profile
- you would expect a lot of atten-
tion to her on the Internet," Perry
said. "Now here I am just as a pro-
fessor without any staff, without
any research, writing a blog that's
gotten pretty popular. I've now got
this presence on the Internet that
in terms of the number of hits is
even higher than the president of
the University."

'1W surprisingly
hasn't seen a
shootout so far

The Victors vs. the eSt
We know the Wolverines have a game tomorrow against Penn State. So what? The team is taking on
Connecticut, the top-ranked squad in the nation, on Saturday - and that's always a big deal. The Daily
has dug through the record books and found Michigan's all-time record versus the No.l team in the na-
tion, and guess what? It's not great. In 19 tries, the Wolverines are 1-18. Can they make it 2-18 on Saturday?

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily SportsEditor
Last month, the CCHA released
its annual captains' poll. The
awards given out ranged from the
serious (best passer) to the silly
(best nickname).
"Best shootout skater," intended
to be a legitimate category, turned
out to be one of the most comi-
cal. The honor went to Wolverine
sophomore forward Aaron Palush-
aj, a talented skater and stickhan-
dler.
What's so funny about Palush-
aj's nod? Well, he plays for the
Michigan hockey team - the only
squad in the conference to not play
in a shootout so far this season.
During the off-season, the con-
ference became the nation's first to
implement a three-player shootout
formation for CCHA games that
remain tied after 60 minutes of
regulation and a five-minute over-
time period.
But the Wolverines haven't
competed in a shootout, let alone
played in overtime, through their
first 20 conference games.
By this time last season, Michi-
gan had already posted three ties.
And it's not like the Wolver-
ines haven't been in close games.
They've played eight games decid-
ed by one goal and won five of
them..
"It's kind of weird," junior act-
ing captain Chris Summers said.
"I guess it's just how the puck
bounces. We don't really expect to
go into overtime or anything like
that. I guess it's just a coincidence
that we haven't."
Summers said it would have
been nice to have an extra period
Saturday night against then-No. 1
Notre Dame, the closest the team
has come to ending regulation in
a tie.
With 31 seconds left in the game,
it appeared that junior defense-
man Steve Kampfer had battled a
loose puck into the back of the net
for the game-tying goal, complet-
ing a comeback from a three-goal
deficit and drawing comparisons
to last year's Frozen Four game

between the two teams.
"They called the goal off, so I
wasn't really getting my hopes up,"
Palushaj said. "Since we haven't
been to overtime this year, I don't
think it went through most of our
heads (that we might)."
And because Michigan hasn't
played an extra pefiod all season,
it logically hasn't competed in a
shootout, either.
The conference decided to
institute the shootout because it
needed a tie-breaking procedure
for the CCHA standings. The team
that wins the shootout gains an
extra point - making it equiva-
lent to a regular or an overtime
victory. Coaches voted and league
officials agreed that an NHL-style,
three-player shootout would be
crowd-pleasing and less draining
on players than endless overtime
periods.
Each Wednesday in practice, the
players divide and compete against
one another in a mock shootout.
But Berenson doesn't think a prac-
tice environment simulates the
pressure of a game-deciding shot
in a hostile arena.
"You try to create some compe-
tition," Berenson said. "But still,
I couldn't tell you for sure who's
going tobe good in a shootout until
they actually do it in a game."
Palushaj, the captain's poll
favorite, and fellow sophomore
forward Carl Hagelin are likely
selections for a shootout. Players
seem to enjoy Wednesday shoo-
touts, always teasing teammates
who miss and cheering players
who score.
This weekend's opponent, Lake
Superior State, has the experi-
ence in shootouts that Michigan
lacks. The Lakers have been in six
overtime games and are tied for
most in the conference. And while
that could give them an edge in a
potential extra frame or pressure-
packed shootout, the Wolverines
aren't worried.
"They've been in them, and we
haven't been in their," Berenson
said. That doesn't concern me.
We're playing to win every game,
not to tie."

What's wrong with recruiting?
Theprocess, not the players

HOLLAND -
When wide receiver Roy
Roundtree decom-
mitted from Purdue
in favor of Michigan on National
Signing Day last year, he drew the
ire of Boilermaker football coach
Joe Tiller.
"If we had an early signing date,
you wouldn't
have another
outfit with a
guy in a wiz-
ard hat sell-
ing snake oil
to get a guy at
the last min-
ute, but that's DAN
what hap- FELDMAN
pened," Til- _
ler told the
Indianapolis Star last February.
You probably won't hear any
coaches blast A.J. Westendorp or
Nader Furrha today, the first day
high school football recruits can
sign National Letters of Intent.
Westendorp is a senior at Hol-
land Christian, and Furrha gradu-
ated from Ann Arbor Pioneer last
month. Both were excellent high
school quarterbacks and will play
at the collegiate level next year --
Westendorp at Central Michigan
and Furrha at Michigan.
Although neither verbally com-
mitted anywhere, both called the
coaches at the other schools that had
recruited them once they decided
to go elsewhere. It wasn't hard for
them. It was the right thing to do.
Roundtree didn't call Tiller,
and the redshirt freshman said at
Michigan Media Day last summer
that he regrets it.
Dissecting how the recruiting
process has changed, several pun-
dits have criticized "kids these
days" for being disloyal. The Mich-
igan football team has already had
seven players back out of verbal
commitments, and it'd be pretty
surprising if at least one more
didn't today. Schools all around the
nation have had similar issues.
But fixing the kids isn't the way
to solve the problem. The bet-
ter answer is ensuring high-end
recruits go through a lower-pres-
sure process like Westendorp and
Furrha, who had a single Division
I offer between them. Although the
rules for Division II recruiting aren't
different, the practices clearly are.
Westendorp says his strength is
scoring touchdowns, and his num-
n 0%

bers certainly back that up. He's not
the fastest, and he's not the biggest,
but he threw 40 touchdowns (with
just four interceptions) and ran for
another 25 this year while leading
his team to a state title.
Most of his interest came from
DivisionIIschools.Themostuncon-
ventional element he encountered
in the recruiting process was Grand
Valley State coach Chuck Martin
stopping by his house to pick up a
highlighttape and askinghimnotto
take an official visit to North Dakota
State. Hardly sinister.
But Westendorp spent most of
his time in the process waiting for
a Division I offer. He finally got it
Sunday, and he will attend Central
Michigan.
Furrha grew up so close to
Michigan Stadium that he proba-
bly would have heard the cheers on
football Saturdays had he not been
at the games.
Division II powerhouse Grand
Valley State also pursued him. He
weighed his options and opted to
walk on at Michigan. It wasn't a
drawn-out public affair. He follows
recruiting, sees players waver in
their commitment to the Wolver-
ines and wonders how hard it is to
make a decision.
Well, it's hard because the pro-
cess is so screwed up. I'm sick of
everyone putting the blame on'
recruits not being mature enough
to honor their commitments.
Are Westendorp and Furrha
better people than all the recruits
nationwide who decommit, or are
there other factors for the recruits
who have multiple options with-top
schools?
Our generation isn't the problem.
It's the way recruiting is set up.
It's in a recruit's best interest to
commit early, even if he's not sure
he's want to attend that school.
By verbally committing, at least in
theory, a school will hold a scholar-
ship for him.
But that isn't always the case.
South Carolina coach Steve Spur-
rier pulled a scholarship offer from
a committed recruit, according to
Palmetto Sports. Spurrier found
better recruits and cast the lesser
player aside.
The NCAA needs to take a few
steps to ensure these tricks don't
spiral out of control:
1. Give recruits the option of
signing a. non-binding letter of
intent at any time. A recruit and a

school can agree to hold a schol-
arship, and the player wouldn't be
allowed to have contact with any
otherschools.
If a player wants to re-open his
recruitment, he could formally 4
rescind the letter. The school
couldn't void it unless the recruit
has disciplinary problems.
This way, schools and recruits
know exactly where they stand.
Players couldn't hold a spot while
flirting with other schools, and
coaches can't pull the rug out from
under recruits.
2. Eliminate oversigning. More
and more, schools are signing more
players than they have room for
under the NCAA's 85-scholarship
limit. It always seems to work out
because someone doesn't qualify
academically or someone isn't
cleared medically to play.
But that leaves coaches in the
position of needing some of their
players to fail. Coaches should have
to show the available scholarships
for every letter of intent, binding or
non-binding.
An added benefit is coaches
would give preference to players
they know would qualify academi-
cally.
3. Guarantee scholarships for
four years. Currently, scholar-
ships are granted on a year-to-year
basis. This would also help stop
coaches from oversigning since
they wouldn't be able to jettison
older players to make room for new
recruits.
4. Investigate and punish. No
set of rules will work if the NCAA
doesn't actively seek out offenders
and discipline them.
These suggestions are not origi-
nal, and they're pretty straight-
forward. But until these or similar
measures are implemented, college
football recruiting will continue to
be a mess.
Recruiting used to be annoying.
It's quickly becoming unbearable.
The NCAA needs to take action
and give top recruits the chance to
show the class of Westendorp and
Furrha.
Although not calling Tiller was a
mistake, Roundtree isn't necessar-
ily a worse personthan Westendorp 4
and Furrha. The other two justben-
efited from goingthrough a simpler,
less-stressful recruiting process.

Personal Statement
The tantric New York Times ByBrianTengel

friend of mine once told me
that reading the Sunday
ew York Times was better
than sex.
Being unfamiliar with the paper
at the time, I couldn't validate his
statement. But it gave me pause.
The Sunday Times must really be
something, I thought, if he's argu-
ing that it's better than sex. So I
started reading to find out.
Originally, I bought the paper
every Sunday at Starbucks on State
Street. But this became too risky -
if I showed up any later than noon,
I'd walk in and find an empty news-
stand, an experience that left me
paralyzed with rage and despair. To
prevent any health complications, I
soon switched to home delivery.
It Now, I walk outside my apart-
ment every Sunday morning at
about 11 a.m. to get the paper. The
heart palpitations begin immedi-
ately. "It better be there, it better be
there," I murmur under my breath,
as if this chant will somehow guar-
antee that my paper has been deliv-
ered. As anyone with a subscription
will tell you, a delivery is anything
but certain.
On those blessed days when I get
the paper, I take it inside and glance
at the content to whet my appetite.
Then, I make a pot of coffee, put on
my beige slippers and go to work. A

feeling of utter bliss soon sets in.
And so I've become addicted to
the knowledge the paper provides.
Without it, I feel shamefully igno-
rant of what's happening in the
world. I feel stranded in Ann Arbor,
enclosed in the bubble of academia.
The paper is my antidote to obliv-
ion.
Three years after I first held the
Sunday Times in my hands, I've
realized that my friend's claim
reflects an impassioned reverence
for the art of print journalism and
an enthusiasm for the power of
ideas in shaping society.
But I've also realized something
else - reading the Sunday paper is
perhaps not so unlike having sex.
Both are an art to be pursued with
patience and dedication.
Just as there are different sex
techniques, there are different
techniques for reading the Sunday
Times. And in both cases, some
techniques are much more suc-
cessful than others. It takes time
to discover what works and what
doesn't. If you're impatient, in both
cases things are bound to go less
than smoothly.
Since I've been reading the Sun-
day Times, I've worked tirelessly to
come up with a way to peruse the
entire paper in a reasonable amount
of time (three hours).
The endowment currently pays
out 5 percent of its average market
value each year to the University for
operating costs, financial aid and
other expenditures. At the time of
Lundberg's proposal, the time span

In the Sunday Magazine, I first
read "The Way We Live Now," a
column on current events and cul-
tural trends. I then read the weekly
interview, which typically features
a prominent person in politics (Karl
Rove) or the arts (Sheryl Crow).
Next comes William Safire's col-
umn, "On Language," in which he
examines the etymology of words
that are often used in the media.
Finally, I read the cover story,
which is almost always relevant
and illuminating.
So that's what I do for three

for all those sleepless nights spent

graded and that an intellectual dia-
logue exists outside the classroom.

in his job at the moment to think
about how he will be remembered

mark 10 years since Lundberg came

still be CIO for another decade or
two.
"Before I got here, it was, you
know, 'Where am I going to next?
Where am I going next?'" he said.
"But now it's, 'I don't want to go

ing the average market value for the
5-percent payout was three years.
But to better shield the endow-
ment from volatility in the market,
Lundberg proposed extending that
average market value calculation to
seven years. The longer-term fore-
cast would keep the payout consis-
tent from year to year, regardless
of financial market behavior, and
allow University operations that
use endowment funds to confident-
ly plan for a fixed amount of funding
each year. Lundberg's payout plan
was given the go-ahead, and was
instituted at beginning of the 2006
fiscal year. And today, as many uni-
versities make painful budget cuts
due to decreasing funds from their
endowment, the seven-year payout
has allowed funding for University
operations to stay consistent.
In retrospect, what was so
impressive about implementing a
seven-year average market value
was Lundberg's prudence to do
so in the midst of an overwhelm-
gly bull market. "It's easy to be

complacent when things are going
well, but, you know, we know that
markets will go up and they will
go down," Lundberg said. "And so
when markets go up, it's a good time
to take action and look out and say,
'What could possibly happen?"'
LUNDBERG WILL BE the first
to tell you that crises like the burst-
ing of the dot-com bubble in 2001 or
the fallout on Wall Street this sum-
mer aren't nearly as destructive to
a university endowment as they're
made out to.be. That's because a
major university endowment, like
the University's, is invested in per-
petuity for an infinite amount of
time. There's no end date for the
endowment and no terminating
point when allassets are sold off.
Barring any unforeseen disasters,
the endowment will be around for
as long as the University.
With that in mind, Lundberg's
legacy as the first CIO, though not
as easily seen, could be far more
lasting than that of Mary Sue Cole-

But tempted by cheaper trav-
el costs and better exchange
rates, more students are getting
adventurous or creative with
their study abroad experiences.
The 2008 Open Doors study,
an annual report on study abroad
trends published by the Insti-
tute of International Education,
found that the overall popular-
ity of "non-traditional" destina-
tions like Asia, Africa and Latin

American surged last year. From
2007 to 2008, the numbers of
American students studying in
China, South Africa and India all
grew by more than 20 percent.
Below are just a few of the
more unconventional options
offered by the University, from
study "abroad" trips you won't
need a passport for to remote
locations on the other side of
the globe.

Lakota territories in the Quebec, Canada

Khon Kaen, Thailand
Through a program administered
by the Council on International Edu-
cational Exchange, University stu-
dents can spend a semester studying
the Thai language and national
issues including political and envi-
ronmental tensions- fieldwork that
has certainly grown more intense
given the country's recent political
turmoil. Khon Kaen, in central Thai-
land, wasn't a part of the eruptions of
sometimes-violent anti-government
demonstrations this summer and fall
that, at one point, forced the closure
of both of Bangkok's airports and
portions of the capital's government
district. When a court banned Thai
Prime Minster Somchai Wongsawat
from politics in early December, the
protests dissolved and the airports
were re-opened.

Tibet
In past years, the University's
Department of Asian Languages
and Cultures occasionally organized
summer tours of the region, but the
program is currently postponed indefi-
nitely until the political climate of the
region calms down. The autonomy
of region has long been contested -
Tibet's spiritual leader, the DalaiLama,
has lived in exile since1959. These ten-
sions most recently boiled over last
March when protests turned devolved
into a riot violent and ended with the
Chinese government instating martial
law in the region.
The last University trip was in 2007
when students and faculty toured
monasteries and the countryside on
tourist visas, said Nicole Baker, the
department's graduate program coor-
dinator.

Walpole Island, home of the Bke-
jwanong First Nation, a community
of a few thousand native people,
is just a two-hour drive from Ann
Arbor. Located on the opposite
shore of Lake St. Clair, Walpole
Island is practically shouting dis-
tance from metro Detroit. The trip,
which is sponsored through the tn i-
versity's Global Intercultural Experi-
ence for Undergraduates Program,
is now in the planning stages for this
May. During their four-week stay
on the island, students will work
primarily with Bkejwanong youth,
learning about Ojibwe culture and
the island's ecology.

Dakotas
Similar to the Bkejwanong First
Nation trip, GIEU students will also
have the opportunity to spend a
month this summer on the Lakota
reservation - 1,000 square miles
of unrecognized territory covering
parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska,
Wyoming and Montana. Under
the direction of Engineering Prof.
Kim Kearfott, students will work
witfh area nonprofit organizations
to measure and assess the dan-
gers of radiation levels caused by
a long history of uranium mining
in the region.

The University's five-week sum-
mer program with Universite Laval
is a popular choice with French
students who don't have an entire
summer to spend abroad or stu-
dents who don't want to shell out
the big bucks to cover the high cost
of living in Paris. And although a
plane ticket is probably the most
practical, if you always longed to
take a road trip through Ontario,
here's your chance. The campus
in Quebec City is just a short 12.5-
hour drive away. That's closer than
Orlando, Fla.

POINTS.
Three things you can talk about this week:
1. Unpaid taxes
2. Iraqi elections
3. Stimulus packages
And three things you can't:
1. Obama sans suit jacket
2. Rod Blagojevich
3. Bong-hitting Phelps

Some of the Fellows said it could
be a little jarring to don a book bag
for the first time in decades and
walk into a classroom where even
the lecturer seems to be younger

Kobell was not surprised that
the presence ofther and the Fellows
on campus confuses some Univer-
sity students.
"When I went to school here,
the fellowship wasn't very known,"
she said.
Deitsch, who has written for
Sports Illustrated for 12 years, said
the introductory creative writ-
ing workshop he took was a novel
experience.
"We had to write and get our work
workshopped around the room," he
said. "What's more fun than get-
ting ten 20-year-old girls telling you
what's wrong with your writing?"

Pomeroy, a Rome correspondent
for Reuters, took a screenwriting
class and realized just how differ-
ent his life experiences have been
compared to the average University
student.
"I've heard a couple oftheirscript
ideas, and it's very interesting to see
what they write about," he said. "I'm
not American. I'm not 20 years old.
And there's just such a huge differ-
ence. They write about kids in high
school or kids in high school who've
just come to University."

travel. Each class of Fellows takes
two domestic and two international

One thing to be noted of the
Fellows is their cultural and jour-
nalistic. Former Fellows include
journalists like Jill Abramson, a
managing editor The New York

VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
A vegetable orgy
For some people, half the fun of
watching the Super Bowl last Sunday
was seeing the new commercials that
companies paid millions of dollars
to roll out. This adtthough, wasn't
among them. And that may or may
not be a bad thing.
This video presents a commercial
sponsoredbyPETA,the animalrights
organization, that NBC banned from
airing on Sunday. Let's just say that
it may encourage all those carnivo-
rous football fans to reconsider their
views of vegetarianism.
With a heavy metal guitar riff
slowly building in the background,
the video starts by showing three
different scantily-clad women seduc-
tively undressing themselves. Once
they're wearing nothing but lacy bras
and panties, the music climaxes and
the debauchery begins.
The women each start caressing
and fondling different vegetables.
One woman rubs a stalk of broccoli
up her leg, another provocatively
licks the curvaceous side ofa pump-
kin. The third woman pretends she's
thrustingasparagusintoherself.Dur-
ing this vegetable orgy, the women
are illuminated by the soft glow of
candles. And halfway through the
video, a message appears: "Studies
show vegetarians have better sex."
Pamela Anderson is a PETA activ-
ist, so perhaps this ad isn't so odd.

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
Welcome back, Kwame! - Kwame Kilpatrick,
Detroit's favorite felon and former mayor, was
released from the clinker Tuesday after 99 days in
an isolated cell. Kilpatrick has already high-tailed it
to Dallas, but you can still celebrate with a Kwame-
style party of your own. Get out the champagne and
the motorcycles. Make a stripper disappear. Then
claim the expense on your income tax. Remember,
it's not a party unless it's on the taxpayers' dime.
Throwing this party? Let us know. TheStatement@umich.edu
STUDY OF THE WEEK
Boys with unpopular names more likely to be felons
Boys in the United States with less popular names' like Ernest or
Ivan are more likely to commit crimes than boys with popular names
like Michael or David, according to a study recently published in the
Social Science Quarterly by researchers from Shippensburg University
in Pennsylvania.
In the study, the researchers examined the first names of male
juveniles compared with the first names of male juvenile delinquents.
Then, they generated a popularity-name index (PNI) for certain names.
Michael, for example, has a PNI of 100, meaning that it was the most
popular name during the time of the study. David has a PNI of50. Names
like Alec, Earnest, Ivan, Kareem and Malcolm all have a PNI of one.
The researchers concluded that juveniles with unpopular names are
more likely to engage in crime, regardless oftheir race.While unpopular
names obviously don't cause crime, researchers said, they often result in
social isolation that canlead to crime.

Erik Lundberg is the biggest name on
campus that you don't know. As chief
investment officer, he oversees the
University's multi-billion-dollar
endowment. And in the midst of a financial
crisis, he has never been more needed.
By Andy Kroll
Daily Investigative Editor
The most important office in the entire
University of Michigan system isn't
even on University property. About a
mile from the Ann Arbor campus, it's at the
cornerofHuron Street and Main Street, where
a towering, angular office building looms large
over the city's business district.
In a fifth floor suite of that building, ateam
of finance specialists in the University Invest-
ment office are hard at work managing the
school's vast investment portfolio. The largest
of these is the University's multi-billion-dollar
endowment - a portfolio of over 6,000 differ-
ent investments in stocks, bonds, venture capi-
tal, real estate and energy, among others - and
the school's financial backbone.
At the entrance to the Investment Office is
a glass door that bears the University seal, a
reminder of nearly 200 years of history. And
it's the job of the investors on the other side of
that door to lay the financial groundwork for
another couple centuries of maize and blue.
Leading that team is Erik Lundberg, the
University's 49-year-old, Norwegian-born
chief investment officer.
Since arriving in Ann Arbor in the fall of
1999, Lundberg has transformed a relative-
ly modest portfolio into one of the leading
endowments in all of higher education. Before
the collapse of the financial markets last fall,
Lundberg had more than tripled the value of
the endowment - from $2.5 billion in 1999 to
$7.6 billion as of June 30. For the 2007 fiscal
year, the endowment recorded a return of over
25 percent, one of the highest in the country.
In annual rankings published by the National
Association of College and University Business
Officers, the University's endowment climbed
from13th overall and 4th among public schools
in 2002 to 8th and 2nd, respectively, in 2007.
The success in investing couldn't have come
at a better time. State appropriations, once
a substantial and reliable source of funding,
have decreased more than $96 million in the
past seven years when measured for inflation
- meaning that the University must rely on its
endowment more than ever before.
Lundberg is the one who must guide the
University through the current financial crisis,
guarding the endowment against depletion at
a time when donors are tightening their belts
and the stock market is wrought with uncer-
tainty. It's a difficult job and the University has
not ridden through the recession unscathed.
Since the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1,
the endowment has lost an estimated 20 to 30
percent of its value. But with the economy as it
is it's to Lundberg's credit that the University
wasn't hit harder andsooner. The endowments
of other major universities can attest to that -
in June 2007, when the University recorded a
6.4 percent on its investments, large endow-
ment funds lost an average of 4.4 percent.
J. Ira Harris, a veteran investor and long-
time member of an external investment com-
mittee that advises the chief investment officer

and investment team, says Lundberg's job is
paramount to the success of the University.
"There are a very important number of jobs
at Michigan, including the president, includ-
ing the head football coach and including the
chief investment officer," Harris said.
Yet unlike University President Mary Sue
'Coleman or Michigan football coach Rich
Rodriguez, Lundberg keeps a low profile on
campus.,He tends to stick to his downtown
office - that is, when he's not on the road,
meeting investing partners and fund manag-
ers from throughout the world.
Nor does he fit "master of the universe"
financial guru image, either. Over two inter-
views in October and January at the Invest-
ment Office, Lundberg spoke with me about
his job, how the endowment works and his
thoughts on the future of the financial mar-
kets. In each interview, his modest, laid-back
tone and impression (he prefers sport jackets
with khakis or jeans over suits) belied the sub-
ject of our conversations: billions of dollars of'
investments, a financial crisis crippling the
global economy and the University's future.
His faint Norwegian accent affecting the
occasional word or two, Lundberg described
the composition of the endowment simply,
patiently,.for someone unfamiliar with long-
short trading strategies or derivatives. For
instance, in discussing the endowment's vari-
ous assets classes - the groupings of invest-
ments like stocks or realestate worth hundreds
of millions of dollars each - he referred to
them instead not as complex financial assets
but as "buckets" with money in them.
That modesty, however, understates the
growingimportance ofthe endowment.Today,
the University, quite frankly, could not exist
without it. And it follows that the University
wouldnot be where it istoday without the man
guiding the University endowment.
ALMOST 4,000 MILES fromAnn Arbor lays
the port city of Stavanger, Norway, located on
the country's southwestern coast bordering
the North Sea - territory once occupied by
Vikings. It was in this nearly 1,000-year-old
city founded on industries like shipping, ship-
building, fishing and canning where Lundberg
grew up. And it was with the discovery of oil in
the North Sea off of Norway in the late 1960s
that the futures of both Stavanger and Lund-
berg were transformed.
With money flowing in almost as fast the
newfound oil, Stavanger quickly grew into a
thriving energy hub for all of Europe. Today,
nearly every major oil corporation in the world
- Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, Total, ConocoPhil-
lips and Norway's Statoil - have operations in
or near the city, and the city website describes
Stavanger as the "energy capital of both Nor-
way and Europe." This influx of wealth and
prosperity to Stavanger provided the city's
young people with the chance to study busi-
ness abroad and then return home, degrees in
hand, to well-paying jobs in the oil industry.
Lundberg followed suit and traveled to
Madison, Wis. as a 20-year-old to study busi-
ness at the University ofWisconsin. But instead
of returning to Norway, he stayed in the U.S.
after meeting his future wife in Madison. He
then went on to earn an MBA in finance and
international business from Ohio State Uni-
versity. When asked about trading Scandina-
via for the Big Ten, Lundberg laughed, saying
that the Midwest was his home now. "I like it
here," he said. "I like public schools; I went to
public schools."

In 1986, after graduating from Ohio State,
he began working in corporate finance at
Wisconsin Bell and later took a job in inves-
tor relations with phone company Ameritech.
Lundberg rose within the company to become
an international equity analyst and then an
investment strategist in Ameritech's pension
department in Chicago. But by that point, he
decided he needed a new challenge. That's
when the University of Michigan, in the midst
of a national search for its first-ever chief
investment officer in 1999, came knocking.
Harris, of the external investment advisory
committee, was workingin Chicago at the time
as an executive for a major private investment
firm, and interviewed Lundberg on behalf of
the University for the CIO position. At the end
of the interview, Harris immediately knew
the search was over. "After spending a couple
hours with him my response back to the peo-
ple in Ann Arbor was if they didn't hire him, I
was going to hire him," Harris said.
University officials took Harris's advice and
hired Lundberg to be the first CIO. He would
be in charge of getting the University's newly
conceived Investment Office off the ground
and responsible for building a new investment
team from scratch. Yet the endowment Lund-
berg and his fresh-faced team took over in the
final few months of 1999, valued at $2.5 billion,
was hardly the robust nest egg it is now.
PRIOR TO LUNDBERG'S ARRIVAL, manage-
ment of the endowment was left to the Uni-
versity's Treasury Office, which traditionally
handles financial operations like debt and risk
management (including University employee
insurance coverage), check writing and over-
sight of the MCard program. Under the Trea-
sury Office's direction, the endowment made
small gains - $1.9 billion in the 10 years before
Lundberg arrived - and measured poorly
against portfolios at comparable universities.
"The University went through a long, long
time years ago with terrible performance in its
investments, in its endowments," Harris said.
University officials knew they needed a bet-
ter performing endowment because, as recent
years had shown, poor endowment perfor-
mance greatly hindered the University's abil-
ity to raise money and court potential donors.
When a donor gives money, the University's
investment tyam generally invests it in hopes
of generating the largest returns possible on
the original donation amount. But when the
endowment was recording poor investment
returns, University fundraisers faced a daunt-
ing task in convincing donors to give.
"Well, the school does such abad job invest-
ing it, I'll invest it and give it to you myself,"
Harris said, recalling a common response he
heard from donors during capital fundraising
campaigns.
All that began to change around the turn
of the century. As the new CIO leading ; new
Investment Office, Lundberg's first major task
was establishing and training a team of ana-
lysts and experts working around him to grow
the endowment. Looking back on Lundberg's
decade as CIO, colleagues say the development
of a top-notch investment group has been one
of Lundberg's main achievements.
University chief financial officer Tim Slot-
tow, who works closely with Lundberg, said
the investment team, which Lundberg almost
single-handedly built and developed himself,
today ranks as one of the top among all uni-
versities public and private. And he did this,
Slottow added, without hiring senior investors

away from elite hedge funds or endowments.
"He's done it rather by hiring, you know, junior
or mid-level analysts, and working with them
to develop their expertise and their ability to
really learn what he does," Slottow said.
For Lundberg, managing an elite invest-
ment team doesn't mean hovering over their
shoulders all the time. Instead, he believes in
givinghis analysts the autonomytosucceed on
their own and to develop individually as inves-
tors. One of his key ingredients for successful
endowment investing, as he described it in an
investment presentation last April, is to "Allow
staff to excel as long term investors."
In terms of strategy, one hallmark of Lun-
dberg's tenure as CIO has been to diversify
the endowment by increasing the number of
investments made abroad. In the nine years
since his arrival, Lundberg and his team have
increased investments in markets like China,
Japan, Hong Kong and Russia. And until the
global financial crisis devalued investments
worldwide, this internationalization of the
endowment reaped dividends for Lundberg
and his investment team, especially due to the
U.S. dollar's decline in comparison with inter-
national currencies.
Within the U.S., Lundberg and his team
have succeeded in investing with some of the
best partners. One such venture capital firm,
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in Menlo
Park, Calif., is one of the leading green tech-
nology funds in the country, if not the world.
Kleiner was the subject of a New York Times
Magazine cover story in October, and lauded
by The Times as "a temple of capitalism."
No university endowment is immune from
the global financial turmoil. In early Decem-
ber, Harvard announced losses of 22 percent,
or more than $8 billion, to its endowment,
which was valued at $36.9 billion as of June30.
Likewise, the University of California endow-
ment lost $1 billion-in the first nine months of
2008, $700 million of which tanked between
July and the end of September.
The University of Michigan's endowment
has suffered losses, too. By December the
endowment had lost between $1.52 billion and
'$2.28 billion. And it wasn't the first time the
endowment took a hit ina financial crisis.
When the dot-com bubble burst in2000 and
2001, the endowment recorded an first annual
loss of $200 million, dropping from $3.6 to
$3.4 billion - it's first loss in 12 years, and the
firstsince Lundberg's arrival.With the current
financial crisis, however, Lundberg smartly
protected the endowment in the years preced-
ing the recession and lessened the impact such
a crisis would have.
As the full scope of the subprime credit
crisis became apparent in 2006 and 2007,
investments in risky mortgage-backed securi-
ties began suffering huge losses. Unlike other
university that watched their investments in
mortgage-backed securities plummet, Lun-
dberg and his team had deemed such invest-
ments too risky, and avoided what in fact
turned out to be a toxic market. "We didn't get
paid enough for taking that risk," Lundberg
said. "So we steered away from the subprime...
and focused the investments other places."
But Lundberg's most notable move was
changing the way the endowment pays out
money to the University. A little over two
years ago, when the endowment was record-
ing incredible returns, Lundberg came to Slot-
tow with a proposal: He wanted to change the
way the University determines the endow-
