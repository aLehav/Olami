elite runners - many of whom
have broken that four-minute
barrier - will gather just outside
of Michigan's campus at Saline
High School's track to participate
in the Running Institute Mile.
Former Wolverine track athlete
Nick Willis is responsible for
putting everything together and
creating a race that has drawn
world-class runners from Oregon
and Colorado, to New York and
Ann Arbor.
When the US is finished with
track season in June, there are
no more elite races for athletes to
compete in without going over-
seas to Europe. This was a prob-
lem for Willis, who could not
make it to Europe, but wanted to
compete before heading into the
World Championships. The solu-
tion was simple - he would create
an elite race right in his home-
town of Ann Arbor and also take
a shot at breaking the record for
the fastest mile run in the state
of Michigan. The record is cur-
rently held by former Michigan
track star Kevin Sullivan, with a
time of 3.55. Willis admitted that
Sullivan was one of his heroes
growing up and was a big reason
he chose to run for Michigan.
"Sullivan was a legend from U
of M, so it would be nice to have
a crack at that," Willis said. "It
gives the crowd something to
look forward to. To say, 'Wow, we
just saw the fastest race ever run
in the state of Michigan,' espe-
cially on a high school track, in a
local town like Saline."
When news spread that Willis
would be hosting an elite race to
prepare for the World Champion-
ships and attempt to set a state
record, there were plenty of run-
ners interested.
"I know a lot of these runners
and they respect my running, so
they trust it will be a high-quality
race if I'm in it as well," Willis
said.
The respect from his fellow
runners is well earned. Willis
has competed in three Olympic
Games, winning silver in the
1,500-meter run in 2008 and
bearing New Zealand's flag for
the opening ceremony in 2012.
While competing for Michigan

from 2003-2005, he was a five-
time NCAA All American, three-
time Big Ten Champion and
two-time NCAA Champion.
It also helps that the Running
Institute in Ann Arbor will
be sponsoring the race and
providing prize money to the first
five finishers.
The runners who make the trip
to Ann Arbor will be treated well.
Willis is hoping to show them just
how great the city and Michigan's
campus is.
"We're going to show them
out to some restaurants the night
before and the night afterand give
them a dose of what Ann Arbor is
like in the summer," Willis said.
"It's the best place in the world in
my opinion, so hopefully they feel
the same way."
If there is enough community
support and general interest,
Willis has goals of making this
the first of an annual competition.
Having this race every year
would be a huge advantage for
American runners who would
otherwise head into the World
Championships without a tune-
up race. It also has implications
for recruiting and the future of
Michigan track.
"It's always good for recruiting
when they know that this is a
town that supports high-level
completion in our sport," Willis
said. "It just gives a bit more
credibility when high schoolers
are thinking of where they want
to go. Do they want to go to Tulsa,
Oklahoma or Ann Arbor where a
world-class mile was run?"

Security
raised
after
murder
AAPD, University
Police increase
patrols of area
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily News Editor
Following the homicide of
medical student Paul DeWolf,
whose body was found July 24
in his apartment in the Phi Rho
Sigma medical fraternity, Uni-
versity Police and the Ann Arbor
Police Department are workingto
ease residents' and students' fears
with increased police presence.
AAPD Lt. Ed Dreslinski said
on-duty officers have been asked
to make increased patrols in
the area around North Ingalls
Street, adding that crime is not
common there.
Dreslinski said the increased
police presence is two-fold -
intended both to alleviate resi-
dents' fears and possibly aid in the
investigation that has seen coop-
eration between the AAPD, Uni-
versity Police and the Air Force
Office of Special Investigations.
"We also want to be in the
area because we may run into
something - somebody may see
something or see a police officer
and run up and (give a tip) ... so
it's a couple of reasons," He said.
"We want to seek every option we
can (to find information)."
Since the death occurred
off-campus, AAPD is leading
the investigation. University
Police are cooperating with
the process and, according to
spokeswoman Diane Brown,
have also increased their
presence on Central Campus in
order to ease students' anxiety.

Regents and faculty
to conduct search for
Coleman's successor
By JENNIFER CALFAS and
AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporters
While the University's presiden-
tial search has officially begun, it
is still uncertain whether students
will be represented in the process.
The University's Board of
Regents announced the appoint-
ment of the presidential search
advisory committee - which will
appoint University President Mary
Sue Coleman's successor - but it
does not include students.
The 16-person advisory
committee is comprised of eight
regents and eight faculty members
who will work alongside Russell
Reynolds Associates, the executive

recruiting firm appointed to
lead the search. The 16-member
committee in 2002 included two
students: University alum Matt
Nolan, then Michigan Student
Assembly president, and University
alum Lisa Jackson, a doctoral
student of psychology.
While Business senior
Michael Proppe, Central Student
Government president, advocated
for similar student representation
on the current committee, his
requests went unfulfilled.
The regents plan to hold public
meetings in September and October
to receive feedback from students,
but Proppe said without actual
student representation on the
committee, he is concerned that
studentinputwillnotbeaseffective.
"We need some sort of way
of knowing that the search
committee, the consultants and the
regents aren't just going to sit there
and listen politely and just nod

their heads and never really discuss
it again," he said.
Proppe said he is already in
talks with regents about increas-
ing student input and there is still
a possibility of adding a student
representative to the committee.
He spoke briefly to Regent Andrew
Richner (R- Grosse Pointe Park) on
Tuesday and with E. Royster Harp-
er, vice president for student affairs,
on a separate occasion to create a
plan to "ensure there is significant
input still in the search process."
Proppe said he hopes to have
more conversations with regents in
the future, and added that he's "not
going to close any doors" on advo-
cating for a student representative.
In a statement to The Michigan
Dailyonbehalfoftheboard, Regent
Laurence Dietch (D - Bloomfield
Hills) wrote that the committee
aspires to seek input from a wide
array of students.

MHacks to host the largest
college hackathon in country

Event to be held in
Big House, anticipates
1,200 contestants
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
In February, more than 500
students from across the country
attended the first ever MHacks
hackathon at the University,
taking over Palmer Commons and
setting a new college hackathon
attendance record.
But when organizers sought a
location for the September 20-22
event, they realized one of the
only locations on campus big
enough to hold the anticipated
1,000 hackers was the nation's
largest footballvenue - Michigan
Stadium.
Hackathons are competitions
where "hackers" develop apps
and programs in a period that
usually spans between 24 and 48
hours. Participants often forgo
sleep to create the most polished
product possible, and there are
no limitations on what they can
make. MHacks only asks that
competitors don't continue past
work or use parts of past work.

Engineering junior Thomas
Erdmann, the director of the
hackathon, said given the
expected scale of the event,
housing it in Michigan Stadium
isn't a stretch. He said Palmer
Commons was overflowing
during February's event and
though the Ross School of
Business was considered as a
possible venue for the upcoming
hackathon, it was deemed not
large enough.
Though Oosterbaan Field
House could have held the event,
Erdmann said they settled on the
Big House instead. The hacking
will take place in indoor luxury
suits overlooking the field.
"It's going to be epic,"
Erdmann said of the hackathon,
which will give out about
$30,000 in prize money, but will
have no attendance cost and even
reimburse some attendees for
travel costs.
Within the first 24 hours after
tickets were made available
online Tuesday, Erdmann said
1,000 tickets were claimed.
While Erdmann said MHacks
is renting Michigan Stadium for
the event, he declinedto comment
on the rental fees as well as the
total budget of MHacks.

He said, however, there is a
tremendous financial interest in
field of computer science.
"There's an incredible demand
right now for engineers," he said.
"There's so much money going
into technical companies and
technical start-ups."
The event has yet to announce
this year's slate of sponsors, but
last year's included Facebook,
Groupon and Ann Arbor Spark.
"It's not inexpensive,"
Erdmann said."What's important
is that we're going to be able to
provide an incredible experience
for the people attending."
Tom Zurbuchen, a professor
and an associate dean of
entrepreneurial programs in the
College of Engineering, is the
faculty advisor of MHacks. He
said MHacks is one of several
highly visible and student-led
entrepreneurial events held at
the University.
Zurbuchen said MHacks is a
telling representation of what's
great about the University in
the way the event facilitates a
massive collaboration in which
people of different disciplines
work together. He added that
Michigan Stadium is an ideal
venue for the event.

"What speaks better about
competition than being leaders
and coming together as a team in
The Big House?" he said. "This
is what Michigan is about, these
mega-solutions ... I'm really
proud of the students."
Erdmann said MHacks,
together with PennApps
at Pennsylvania State
University and hackMIT at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, make up the three
biggest college hackathons.
PennApps and hackMIT
are aiming for 900 and 1,000
students, respectively, Erdmann
said, but he remains confident
that MHacks will hold onto to
its title as the biggest college
hackathon.
"I'm pretty confident that
MHacks will still be the largest
student hackathon in the world,"
he said.
Still, Erdmann emphasized
that the focus is on the
experience, not the number.
"Being the biggest isn't what's
most important," he said. "Our
number one goal ... is to provide
a really incredible experience for
each and everyone of attendees."
Tentatively, MHacks is

Catching up with No. 1 overall pick Jake Long

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
In 133 years of Michigan football
only two Wolverines have been
selected with the No. 1 overall
pick in the NFL Draft. There was
running back Tom Harmon in the
1941 Draft, who was chosen by the
Chicago Bears. Then a short 67
years later, left tackle Jake Long
was selected No. 1 overall by the
Miami Dolphins in 2008.
Long has had a successful NFL
career thus far, having made four
Pro Bowls in five seasons with the
Dolphins. But the left tackle finds
himself on a new team this season
- the St. Louis Rams - after he
left Miami in free agency this past
offseason.
After being redshirted his
first year on campus, Long took
over the starting job at left tackle
duringhis redshirt freshmenyear
and solidified the position for
then-quarterback Chad Henne
(now with the Jacksonville
Jaguars) for four years. Long
eventually became a two-time
All-American, two-time Big Ten
Offensive Lineman of the Year
and a two-time First-Team All-
Big Ten selection.
Long spoke with the Michigan
Daily over the phone recently
to talk about his time at school,
reflecting on his five seasons with
the Dolphins as well as transi-
tioning to a new team and recov-
ering from his offseason injury.
The Michigan Daily: You've
had a hectic offseason with
changing teams and recovering
from injury, but what was it like
to make the decision to move to

St. Louis? And what has the tran-
sition been like after spendingthe
first five years of your career with
the Miami Dolphins?
Jake Long: The transition has
been going great. I had an oppor-
tunity to come up here and take a
visit, meet with the Rams and coach
(Jeff) Fisher. I really fellin love with
his philosophy and really wanted to
be a part of his team and part of the
Rams organization because I felt
like it was a team that was going
somewhere, going to do something
and I wanted that, soI picked here.
It was a great fit for my wife and I,
and I'm just really happy to be here.
TMD: What are your initial
impressions of your new team and
coach Fisher?
Long: It's a team on the rise,
you know, they did some great
things last year and are only get-
ting better. I think coach Fisher is
a coach every player would love
to play for. This team is young,
energetic and hungry and made
some moves in the offseason, and
I think with a lot of work we can
do some great things this year.
TMD: You have Ohio State-
alum linebacker James Lau-
rinaitis as a teammate on the
Rams - and you used to play with
wide receiver Brian Hartline on
the Dolphins - what's that like?
Do the old college rivalries ever
resurface in the locker room?
Long: Yeah we mess around and
talk about it every now and then,
especially when The Game comes
on and we bring up some memo-
ries. Brian Hartline was a great
player, great teammate, and James
- I went up against him when we
were in college. He was a great

player and now with the Rams he's
a great leader and I'm excited to
play with him.
TMD: You're about to play in
a tough NFC West division. What
are your predictions for the Rams
this season?
Long: It really is a tough division
and that's fun to be a part of because
you can test yourself against the
best players and the best teams, and
that shows you what type of team
you are. You want to go against
the best in every single game and
that's lucky. People will come and
play the best on your team and I
think we can do some great things.
I'm not a guy that predicts wins or
losses, butI think we're going to get
better everysingle day, work hard in
practice and I think we can do some
great things this year.
TMD: How did the culture of
Michigan Football prepare you for
the NFL?
Long: Having (former Michi-
gan) coach (Lloyd) Carr - he is
a father figure to everyone. He
turned boys into men and just

fU' archaeologist aids discovery
of oldest inland European fort

North Carolina site
found containing
16th century Spanish
artifacts and ruins
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
A group of archaeologists have
discovered the ancient remains of
the oldest known European fort in
the U.S. - Fort San Juan - near
Morganton, North Carolina.

Assistant Anthropology Prof.
Robin Beck, assistant curator of
North American Archaeology,
is collaborating with fellow
archaeologists David Moore
of Warren Wilson College and
Christopher Rodning of Tulane
University to excavate the site.
Though Beck and his team
began work around the site in
2004 with help from the National
Geographic Society and the
National Science Foundation,
it was not until last month that
remains of Fort San Juan were
discovered. The fort was hidden

beneath a mound of dirt that was
built on top of the ruins as a result
of the ancient mound-building
culture in the Native American
community of Joara from 800 to
1500 C.E.
Beck said he was excited to
discover the fort, adding that
these discoveries are what make
his job worthwhile.
"It's incredible," he said. "It is
the reason we do archaeology. In
the moment that we realized we
had found the fort after 20 years of
looking for it, for all of us, there is
this euphoria."

The fort was built by Spanish
captain Juan Pardo and men under
his command in the Appalachian
Mountains in 1567.
Joyce Marcus, Director of
the University's Museum of
Anthropology and curator of Latin
American Archaeology, wrote in
an e-mail that Beck's discovery is a
significant archaeological finding.
"Our Museum and Department
(of Anthropology) are filled with
scholars who conduct fieldwork
to obtain new and important data
sets," Marcus said. "As famous

with 1,200 already claimed as
of Wednesday night, Erdmann
said. He said even though more
than 1,000 have signed up, it's
expected that not everyone will
show up.

While the MHacks website
says the event is for undergradu-

said they have admitted every

Chinese metropolis
By CARLINA DUAN
Daily Community Culture Editor
.* When I walk down Qingdao
streets, skyscrapers shout down at
me, regal in their red-capped roofs
and earnest, glinting windows. In
shopping centers, Chinese hip-hop
blares. On my grandpa's TV, an
entertainment channel whirs with
images of girls clunked in mascara
and lipstick. Everywhere I turn:
billboards of Chinese movie stars,
glamorously dangling rolls of toilet
paper; glamorously eating cans of
peach yogurt; glamorously kissing
one another on the cheek. This is
Thinese pop culture at its finest. It
is pop culture thathas unmistakably
filtered every public space, plas-
tering itself on walls, on candy bar
wrappers, on bathroom stalls.
I don't know why I'm so sur-
prised at finding reflections of the
USA Hollywood scene everywhere
in China. Perhaps it's because my
Western upbringing seems so out-
of-place here. Whether I am in a
potsticker restaurant, at the grocery
store, or on the street, everybody
stares, and I often get questioned
whether or not I'm foreign. Over
dinner the other night, my 25-year-
old cousin scanned my face with
hawkish eyes. "Are you wearing
makeup?" she glared. "Yeah," I said,
a bit sheepishly. In high school in
China, my cousins wore white slack-
like uniforms to class everyday.
No nail polish, jewelry, or makeup
allowed. At some schools, a haircut
was required for the girls - hair
must be up to your chin, or shorter.
WhenmysisterandI hungoutatthe
each last week, nobody else wore
bikinis. Girls don't wear spaghetti
straps here. Or show much skin.
Yet inside Chinese fashion
magazines, I flip through pages of
Chinese movie stars prancing on
gjarpets with curled eyelashes, car-
rying their lean, sharp frames with
ease. It is eerie. Here, "beauty" in
the Western sense - makeup, mas-
sive amounts of jewelry, bare skin

The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien.

- seems permitted only to the rich
and the famous. Pop culture, then,
resides very much on this exclu-
sive right to be "beautiful," to wear
your hair down and loose across
the shoulders, to walk with a sil-
ver anklet jangling your every step,
to wear lipstick with tones like,
"Poppy" and "Criminal Red."
Last week, my uncle and I took a
walk to a park. "Would I be consid-
ered fat in America?" he asked, half-
jokingly, yet half-serious. "There's
not one person here who doesn't call
me fat," he stepped on an aluminum
can drifting in the dirt, "But I don't
think I'm thatobese, amI?"
In China, body shape is a topic
that is bluntly stated, rather than
talked around, as I find it some-
times is in the U.S. My aunts and
uncles pinch my arms and tell me
on a daily basis that I have thick
legs. It is not an insult. Here, it is
simple fact. An ordinary truth,
true the way black cicadas here
chirrup and chirrup endlessly at
night. If a person is "fat," they are
called "fat." If a person is "skin-
ny," they, too, are called "skinny."
Body shape is something that
is remarked upon by relatives,
acquaintances, close friends, co-
workers. And not only body shape,
but other bodily descriptors as
well - skin tone, for example. A
desire for tan skin is very, very
rare. When I arrived to Qingdao,
one of my aunts exclaimed at how
"brown" I was. There is an enor-
mous want for pure, "white" skin
- so much so that men and women

alike carry umbrellas outside on a
sunny day, to avoid getting tan and
burnt.
It's a different aesthetic appeal,
and it makes me question how
much of our conception of "beau-
ty" is shaped by what culture we
were raised by, and live in. I'm
surprised by how much American
influence has seeped into Chinese
music, into fashion, into the street
culture. English words and slang
such as "party" and "swag" are
incorporated into the everyday
Chinese language, used primarily
by 20-year-olds and high school-
ers. Hipsters in hipster-glasses
flock the Chinese coffee shops,
which offer menu items such
as "sweet red bean gelato," and
"vanilla ice cream waffle cakes."
Women wearing maxi dresses and
glittery sandals swarm the 6-story
malls, the forever-busy streets.
Yet, there's still very much a
Chinese element to "beauty" that
inhabits its core. I am hyper-
aware of the ways in which I dress
and interact with the physical aes-
thetic of the architecture and the
people here. What I find "beauti-
ful," or lovable, or curious - is
remotely different than what my
Chinese cousins find. It's not about
reaching compromise, or settling
for one version of beauty versus
another. Rather, it's about the cul-
tural intricacies and history of a
place, and what that place is teach-
ing me about how I interact with
my home, and with the new. It's
always, always about wonder.

the heels of the acquittal in the
Trayvon Martin case: on New
Years Day, 2009, Oscar Grant, an
unarmed 22-year-old black man,
was forced off a train for being
involved in a fight and then shot
in the back by white Bay Area
cops.
This is the kind of story look-
ing for a hero. A martyr to rally
people of all races behind fighting
racial prejudice. Instead, Jordan
deftly portrays a complex man,
caught between a family he loves
and a beguiling lifestyle. The
films meanders through Oscar's
last day as if no one knows the
ending. The film simply shows a
day in the life of an ordinary man,
proving not that Oscar is defined
by his death, but that his murder
is so egregious because of it's ran-
domness, the lack of connection it,
has to who Oscar was and how he
lived his life.
First-time writer and direc-
tor Ryan Coogler, who grew up
in the same area as Grant, uses
commonplace dialogue and real-
life locations to ground the film
firmly in reality, avoiding setting
Oscar up as a malleable symbol

for racial tension in the United
States. Oscar is a young man -
barely a man - who has a temper
and listens to rap and spent time
in jail and cheated on the mother
of his daughter. He is imperfect.
Jordan's performance is not reve-
latory; rather, you often forget
that he is acting, that he is not
really Oscar Grant going about
his daily business.
The film is a misnomer as it is
ostensibly about explosive race
relations in America, but spends
most of it's time quietly exam-
ining a mundane day in Oscar's
life. Unfortunately, the audience
knows the catch. The emotional
meat comes -not from Oscar, but
the women in his life. Melonie
Diaz ("You, Me and the Circus")
and Octavia Spencer ("Smashed")
portray his longtime girlfriend
Sophina and mother Wanda as
they both fondly deal with erratic
yet winsome Oscar and hours
later react with tragic poise as
they wade through the confusion
and heartbreak that surrounds
In the wake of
Trayvon Martin,
Coogler tells a
timely tale.
his death.
In movies, death is often
used as an opportunity to make
speeches, to eulogize a person so
much they become just a symbol.
In "Fruitvale" Oscar's death is
not the death of an icon, a soon-
to-be catalyst for racial change.
His friends and family mourn him
as a caring son, a jesting brother,
a sincere friend, a playful father.
The emotion is there, and it's
palpable the connection Coogler
feels to this place and these char-
acters, but the film let's the story
tell itself. No preachy narration
or abstract artistry is necessary
to create anger, because there is
infuriating simplicity in a man
killed for being the wrong race at
the wrong time. "Fruitvale Sta-
tion" allows us to get to know that
man for who he was.

Elastic conductors,
create opportunite

Gold-polyurethane
mix could generate
strong flexible current
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
University researchers have
discovered that gold mixed with
layers of polyurethane can con-
duct 35 Siemens per centimeter
of electricity and be flexible,
opening up new applications for
medical and commercial elec-
tronics.
Roughly three years ago,
Engineering Prof. Nicholas
Kotov began to examine how to
make conductors used in certain
kinds of electronics and medi-
cal implants more flexible. But
when composites were created
to make these conductors, Kotov
and his team realized that they
made strong flexible energy
conductors.
Composite materials can
combine the flexibility of a
polymer and the conductivity
of an inorganic component. In
this case, Kotov combined gold

particles with polyurethane and
found that the final material
held both of these properties.
He said combined materi-
als tend to change in some way
and this case was no different:
the gold particles self-assem-
bled into extensive conductive
bands as the polyurethane was
stretched. Though such self-
assembly had already been dis-
covered in liquids, watching it
occur in a solid state was unex-
pected.
The process of self-assembly
allows the material to remain
both flexible and conductive,
and may not be limdited to just
gold.
"That also could be a very use-
ful property for other nanopar-
ticles,"Kotovsaid.
Although this process is not
yet officially accepted, he said
he is continuing to study the
reaction and believes that it may
be the result of a general prop-
erty of nanoparticles when they
are placed inside a flexible poly-
meric substance.
Kotov said a practical appli-
cation of these newfound flex-
ible conductors is their use in

medical implants, which are
currently fashioned out of rigid
substances.
"Normally, implants are made
from metals or silicone, which
are hard materials," he said.
For example, brain implants
that are used to alleviate some
symptoms of Alzheimer's or
Parkinson's disease do not
always work for extended peri-
ods of time.
Kotov said these devices tend
to lose their ability to stimulate
the brain over time due to scar
tissue formation around the
device. Implants made of more
flexible, tissue-like material
would, in theory, not cause such
scarring because they would be
able to conform to the surface
of an organ, and thus be able
to operate for longer periods of
time.
"These implants also need
to be small in order to avoid
inflammation," he said. "But we
need to retain their conductivity
still when they're small, so we
need unique materials that com-
bine mechanical and electrical
properties.

The Daily's endorsements for City Council primary elections
With the Democratic primary for the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil occurring Aug. 6, it's election season once again in Ann
Arbor. Though the fact that this election is occurring almost
a month prior to when most students arrive for fall classes is extreme-
ly regrettable, that shouldn't make students any less important in the
eyes of the candidates. Students are a large segment of the city's popu-
lation and inhabit every ward in the city, and our interests - such as
affordable housing, public safety and a quality transportation system
- deserve the council's attention. The Michigan Daily's endorsement
has been granted to those candidates who we feel will best represent
students' concerns on city council and who possess the skills necessary
to make their goals a reality.

Lack of student on
Presidential Search
Advisory Committee
a mistake
TO THE DAILY:
I was serving as student body
president in late 2001 when Presi-
dent Lee C. Bollinger announced
his departure for the presidency
of Columbia University, and was
proud to be appointed as a mem-
ber of the Presidential Search
Advisory Committee that recom-
mended the hiring of President
Mary Sue Coleman in 2002.
As a junior on campus, that
experience was very personally
fulfilling and contributed to my
future success. To be in a room
with approximately 15 other fac-
ulty, alumni and staff - and to
be treated as an equal member of
that conversation both by them
and the candidates we consid-
ered - was an experience that
has prepared me for counsel-
ing and interacting with those
much more senior than me, both
during my time as M&A counsel
with a law firm and now as Senior
Counsel to Dow Corning Cor-

poration. That experience and
lesson is what the University of
Michigan - in a nutshell - is all
about to me.
I was surprised to learn that
the PSAC recently announced
and charged with recommend-
ing a replacement for President
Coleman does not include a stu-
dent similarly situated. What
has changed between 2001 and
today to make the students' voice
less important in the process
this time? In an era when rising
tuition, increasing revenue-gen-
erating pressure and decreasing
state funds are conspiring to make
public universities about many
more things than "just" student
education, reminding the can-
didates who will interview for
the presidency of the University
of Michigan that students are at
least one of their stakeholders
seems more important than ever.
This decision, unfortunately,
sends the opposite message. I
urge the Board of Regents (three
of whom were on the board in
2001) to reconsider this decision
and appoint a current student to
the PSAC.

too. Even cooler, the rapport
between all of us "press people"
finally started to incline. The
quiet-keep-to-yourself attitude
on Friday transformed into small
talk in line for the pit, which-led
to some truly amazing conversa-
tions and even some jokes in the
pit. We started looking out for each
other even when we were all tech-
nically competing to get the best
spot -for photographs in the pit.
And yet the only competition that
existed was between us photog-
raphers and those nasty security
guards hounding us to get out of
their space. We were all there for
the same reason, and it felt like we
were in it together. -
My day began with White Lung,
a hardcore punk rock band that
fueled a mosh pit full of angst-
fueled teens, followed by Julia
Holter, who offered pretty much
the polar opposite. Holter's sooth-
ing, experimental and ambient pop
music left the crowd in a pleasant
daze, especially being accompa-
nied by a saxophonist that I found
particularly intriguing -mean-
ing I took a LOT of photos. Phos-
phorescent came next, becoming
a personal favorite of mine for its
vibrant personalities and feel-
good, deeply emotive tunes that
made the band visually and audibly
rich. While I was photographing
during "Song for Zula," my heart
throbbed throughout the whole
song.
Ryan Hemsworth, Solange,
Belle & Sebastian and Rustie took
up the rest of the day, which had
honestly become a blur with the
madness of rushing from show
to show, and the completer-state
of awe I was in as a result of see-
ing these people literally inches
away from me. While I would have
loved the opportunity to actually
see these performances like the
thousands of people watchingwith
their plastic wine glasses in hand,
I realized that I wouldn't trade my
three minutes of glory for any of it.
Day Three
Before I knew it, Sunday was
already here. The big day. The day

jam packed with back-to-back huge
acts. Well, huge to us Pitchforksi-
ans, I suppose - you Lollapalooz-
ers wouldn't understand. From
Foxygen to Lil B, Blood Orange to
Glass Candy, Yo La Tengo to Sky
Ferreira; from Toro Y Moi to M.I.A.
and R. Kelly and finally TNGHT
(deep breath) my mind was already
blown before any of it even hap-
pened. It was, however, also day
three. The last day of Pitchfork for
an entire year. I didn't even want to
think about it.
Luckily, I immediately spotted
quite the distraction as I walked
in. It was the beautiful Sky Fer-
reira, standing outside the press
tent getting interviewed. I. Needed.
To. Take. Her. Picture. This was one
opportunity that I could not pass
up - so I waited anxiously for that
damn interview to be done. After
what seemed to be forever, Sky was
finally free and I was quick to go
over and introduce myself. As we
started to talk, she was so down to
earth that I almost forgot whom I
was really talking to. She was just
a normal person. She even sported
a skirt that I own. Woah. Sky Per-
reira was just another person, like
you and me. A person who also buys
clothes from American Apparel -
like me. I most definitely still had
to take her picture. I didn'twant to
be that annoying photographer/fan
girl so I let her go after some time,
but I couldn't deny that she totally
had made my day.
And then, my day was somehow
made even better when Sam France
and Jonathan Rado of Foxygen
killed it on the Red Stage. France,
with his zany expressiveness, had
without a doubt the greatest stage
presence I had seen at the festival
yet. He climbed up the stage pillars,
whipped his straggly hair around
and danced until his pants nearly
fell down. He was all over the place
in the best way possible, and the
band put on a show that was quite
the workout to photograph, but
incredibly fun nevertheless. As we
left the pit, another photographer
appropriately remarked, "Well that
was something."
With some time to spare before
Blood Orange, I returned to the

Press Tent to charge some of my
electronics when I noticed France
and Rado just casually hanging
out. Even though I was definitely
over being starstruck, I couldn't
help but to go up and talk to them
(and also take their picture). Sam's
crazy onstage energy was com-
pletely switched off - he was just a
laid back, chilled out dude. He, too,
proved to me the ridiculousness of
the word "famous" as we started
talking about all the other cool
acts occurring the rest of the day.
Before leaving, I did get to snag
some quirky photos of them doing
the quirky things that they do. My
smile couldn't get any bigger at that
point.
Next, Blood Orange at the Blue
Stage was so groovy that, with all
the happiness surgingthrough my
body at that moment, all I wanted
to do was groove with them. The
saxophonist from Julia Holter all
of a sudden made a guest appear-
ance, and we make immediately
eye contact. He appeared again
at Chairlift later in the day, fol-
lowed by more eye contact. What
was going on? This day was get-
ting more bizarre by the minute.
Seeing Sky Ferreira passion-
ately play next led me to gain
even more respect for her. Later,
standing next to the speakers,
I'm pretty sure my eardrums
ruptured during Lil B's perfor-
mance. The crowd was absolutely
nuts, wilder than I had ever seen.
People were getting thrown out
left and right. It was definitely a
sight to see, and definitely one to
laugh at after we photographers
were all out of the pit. Man, would
I miss this
Time flew faster and faster.
Toro Y Moi: Done. M.I.A.: Done.
R. Kelly: Done. R. Kelly's balloon
birds released during "I Believe
I Can Fly" flew away. Finally,
the closing act of the night and
weekend was here. TNGHT was
finally here tonight. And we only
got to photograph one single
song before we were kicked out.
So TNGHT was quickly checked
off the list as well. Done. Along
with the few photographers that
were left during this final act,

I walked out of that pit for the
last time, put my stuff down and
just danced away all of the emo-
tions I had at that moment. I was
now done, too. Done with one
of the most difficult weekends
of my life. Done with one of the
most inspiring weekends of my
life. Done working side-by-side,
minute-after-minute for the past
three days. Done being inches
away from the talented artists we
got to photograph each day. Done
with the music. Done with the
heat. Done with the crowds. Done
with the pit. Done with the smiles
and laughter at things that only
we photographers would under-
stand. Done with the camaraderie.
Done with the job. Done with this
weekend. There were too many
dones happening too fast. I was
overwhelmed with feelings. I was
already experiencing withdrawals
before I had even left Union Park.
I just didn't want this all to end.
As I was walking out of TNGHT

in a daze, I ran into - who else? -
the saxophonist that surfaced all
weekend long, for whatever rea-
son. He stopped me and we started
talking. First, about the fact that
he kept noticing me taking pic-
tures of him. Oops. But it evolved
into something much deeper -
about life, and what we were doing
with it, and why ... etc. He told me
something that summed up the
entire weekend for me: We can do
great things if we do them together.
We can do great things if we
do them together. This weekend
was so meaningful to me because
it was about just that: Collaborat-
ing with others to create great-
ness. Whether it was with the
other photographers or the artists
that we photographed or just any-
one that I met. We were working
together to create something tarf -
gible or intangible, a photograph,
a feeling, a memory, a laugh, a
song, a lesson - anything. All that
matters is that we did it together.

Only the races in Wards 3 and
4 are contested Tuesday. In Ward
3, Julie Grand is running against
incumbent Stephen Kunselman
(D-Ward 3). Grand currently
chairs the city's Park Advisory
Commission and is a lecturer at
the University's Dearborn cam-
pus, havingearned both a master's
degree and a PhD from the Uni-
versity's School of Public Health.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Grand emphasized a
communicative and procedural
process for addressing challenges
the city faces, as well as public
service in her current capacity as
the Park Commission chair. She
also identified downtown devel-
opment with an eye toward the
long term as being important to
students, envisioning that empty
spaces will soon be developed.
While she mentioned core city
services as one of her priorities,
her knowledge of city issues per-

taining to students - such as the
provision requiring landlords to
wait 70 days before showing their
properties to people seeking a
place to live next year - left some-
thing to be desired.
Kunselman has served three
terms on the council in Ward 3 and
holds a master's degree in urban
planning from the University.
When asked about what he per-
ceived to be the most important
issues for students, his immediate
response was safety. Though he
supported many of the student-
focused apartment complexes and
opposed height caps on the build-
ings he does not support large
developments, such as the 413 E.
Huron development. He placed lit-
tle emphasis on engaging the com-
munity when making decisions.
* While Grand clearly has a strong
desire to serve the public and her
communicative style is promis-
ing, The Michigan Daily endorses

STEPHEN KUNSELMAN for
Ward 3 because of his extensive
experience in city government and
grasp of student priorities - but
strongly encourages him to reach
out to his constituents for their
input on city matters.
In Ward 4, incumbent Marcia
Higgins (D- Ward 4) faces chal-
lenger Jack Eaton. Higgins has
served on the council for 14 years
and has played a key role in the
Ann Arbor Developing Down-
town initiative. She wants to con-
tinue developing the downtown
area and sees increasing density
there as a way to reduce housing
prices citywide. While talking
with The Daily, she placed much
importance on building a public
transit station linking Ann Arbor
to surrounding cities on Fuller
Road - despite the setbacks over
the project in 2012 - stressing
the availability of federal match-
ing funds as a great opportunity

for the city. Such a
project would greatly
benefit students - as
many don't have access
to cars - and her pro-
fessed desire to con-
nectAnn Arbor to both
Detroit and Chicago
deserves consider-
able praise. She also
acknowledged existing
flaws in the city's storm
drain system - which
has recently flooded
streets in a significant
portion of the city -
and expressed her
support for a careful
overview of the system.
Eaton is a labor
attorney who repre-
sents many transit
workers across the

state and has been
quite active in the
Ann Arbor communi-
ty, starting the Neigh-
borhood Alliance and
helping other neigh-
borhoods organize.
While talking to The
Daily he repeatedly
lamented students'
lack of engagement
in city politics and
encouraged them to
bring their concerns
to him, rather than
emphasizing a more
proactive approach on .
his part. He displayed
a strong grasp of pub-
lic safety issues, and
though supportive of
improved public tran-
sit he believes that

expanding the exist-
ing train station on
Depot Street would
be a better idea than
building a new sta-
tion on Fuller Road.
However, his idea for
the scale of this proj-
ect was mostly limited
to linking suburbs to
the city.
While Eaton's
desire for the student
body to connect with
him is admirable.
The Michigan Daily
endorses MARCIA
HIGGINS for Ward
4 because of her
attentiveness to the
needs of students and
young professionals is

Sky Ferreira is an indie singer/songwriter and a legitimate angel.
Tm p

really realize what this meant.
Until I got there, that is.
Day One
After a train ride and a two-
mile walk that tortured me with
anxious anticipation, similar to
that of Christmas morning, my
whole body lit up as I was final-
ly allowed to "walk down the
stairs" to the festival entry. I do
have to admit how satisfying it
was walking past those painfully
long lines to get in and stopping
at the 10-person-long line at the
press check in. Standing there,
I tried hard to conceal my hard-
core staring at the people I was
in line with. Everyone seemed so
official, so legitimate ... and then
there was me. I wasn't going to let
myself become intimidated, I told
myself - though I'd be lying if I
said I wasn't already a little.
Finally I was all checked in, all
credential-ized with this new pur-
ple tag accessorizing my camera.
Then I paused. Now what? I didn't
know what to do, where to begin,
now that Iwas here, and by myself,
and this was really happening. I
checked the schedule and Frankie
Rose had just begun her set, so I
rushed over to the Blue Stage to
start shooting. I approached the
fence where the security guard
stood and I tried to get through.
All of a sudden, I was standing
right in front of the stage with the
whole gated-in crowd behind me.
I was maybe five feet from Frankie
Rose. As she belted "Night Swim,"
a single off her latest album, I was
in complete and utter awe. It was
as if my motor skills had become
disabled. It took me a minute to
regain my consciousness and start
actually doing what I was there to
do.
I took a total of about 10 pic-
tures before I was pushed out of
the way and yelled at to leave by
some (typically) huge and scary
security guards. What's going on?
Ijustgot here ... and now I have to
leave? I suppose my confusion was
blatant; one of the other photogs
explained to me that we could
only be in the "pit" for the first
three songs of each artist. Man,
did I feel out of the loop.
I wanted to make sure that I
was on time for the next show so
that I could be there for the whole
three songs and - who knows! -
maybe take 11 photos instead of
10. Mac DeMarco came up next
on the Green Stage, so I headed
over to get in line. The day was
only beginning, and I already
felt overwhelmed, both mentally
and physically. I was drenched in

sweat from the glaring sun, and I
evidently had a lot to get the hang
of.
But Mac DeMarco made none
of that matter anymore. His goofy,
free-spirited energy made me
and the whole crowd so pumped
up and excited to be there in this
moment, and this whole. week-
end for that matter. Even while I
was fighting my way through the
crowded pit full of photographers
to get the shots to do him justice, I
caught myself smiling and laugh-
ing and jamming out with him.
and his naturally great voice and
stage persona. It was during this
show that I encountered my first
round of chills from P4K 2013. I
walked out of that pit with literal
"WOW"s spilling out of my mouth,
even though I wasn't really saying
it to anyone in particular. He is
awesome. This is awesome. Adren-
aline rushed through my body as I
reflected upon what had just hap-
pened. Beinga fan is a ton of fun,
but being a photographer for the
show - having a purpose, work-
ing alongside all these artists,
both the photographers in the pit
and the ones performing onstage
created for an energy - that was
unexplainable.
The rest of my night followed
in a similar fashion with more
and more chills, albeit in a folksier
way, as I attended Woods, Mikal
Cronin and Joanna Newsom.
Newsom's ethereal serenades had
everyone (especially me) under
a spell. I photographed my three
songs, got out and just lied down
in the grass in the middle of all
these people without knowing a
soul. But I didn't have to. Right
there, in that moment, nothing
else mattered. The peaceful tri-
angle of intimacy between me
and the crowd and Joanna New-
som was pure magic. What I was
doing was magic. Today was
magic.
Day Two
I went into day two with a
confidence that I had lacked the
day before. I finally felt accus-
tomed to the way things worked,
where to go and when. The cool-
est part was that this was actually
starting to feel like the so-called
"real world." I wasn't in some
college fantasy land anymore; I
was working alongside photo-
journalists and reporters from
all over the country from impor-
tant publications. And yet we
were all there, together, doing
the same thing. For the first time
ever, I felt like a real journalist,
like what I was doing mattered

It was just two years ago when
I, a recent high school graduate,
was blown away by the magic of
Pitchfork Music Festival for the

first time. I still remember the
chills that crept through my body
as I witnessed those artists cre-
ate brilliance. This time around
- acting as a photographer and
reporter rather than just a care-
free fan - I had doubts about how
the festival would pan out.
While I would be traveling
back home to Chicago to attend
Pitchfork, I wouldn't have the
luxury of wandering around
wherever my heart desired. This

Graduation day

year, I would be lugging around
my three cameras, a backpack
full of lenses and a tag titled,
"Press," that ultimately felt the
heaviest of them all. To all of the
other attendees, I was no longer
an "us," but rather a "them" - a
member of The Press. My job,
first and foremost, was to cap-
ture the essence of the festival
through my cameras, not just my
brain. Now, taking photographs
is second nature to me, so I didn't

Graduation day - the day
we all look forward to
our whole lives. After all,
it's the time we
finally receive
our "golden
ticket" that,
gets us into
the workforce.
I should be
jumping for
joy - no more SARA
exams, all- SHOUHAYIB
nighters and
endless pages
of reading to do that make me
want to gouge my eyes out. I'm
about to graduate from one of the
most amazing universities in the
world. I mean, I should be happy,
right? The truth is, I've never
been more scared in my life.
But before I get into all of that,
I want to rewind back to the day
that I got accepted as a transfer
student from Grand Valley State
University. I was on vacation in
Florida with my friend Alex in
March 2010 when my Mom called
me. When I saw her name pop up
on my caller ID, I was positive she
was calling just to fulfill her paren-
tal duty and make sure I was doing
all right. But when I answered, she
said something that caught me off
guard. "Hello, Miss Wolverine,"
she said. I thought she was getting
me confused with my sister for a
second - she also went to school
here. Once I realized she really did
mean to call me, I went screaming
and running around like I had just
won the lottery. I remember think-
ing it was the best day of my life.
And in hindsight, it still kind of is.
Being a transfer student as a
sophomore was tough, though.
Everyone had already made their
friends as freshman, and I felt
like a fish out of water. I joined
club volleyball, WOLV-TV and the
Lebanese Student Association. I
quickly made friends, and I start-
ed to feel a little more integrated
into University life.
However, I wasn't the typical
college student - and with only
a week left, I don't think I ever
will be. I didn't go to my gradu-
ation ceremony for any of my
departments or walk in May with
my class. I wasn't a big partier, I
hated going to football games and
I went home a lot to see my family.
I consistently complained about
classes being stressful and always
said things like, "Ugh, I'm so over
school." But now that that time is
here and it actually is going to be

over, I feel entirely different.
To be frank, all I want to do is
bundle up in my bed with Edy's
Cookies 'N Cream ice cream while
clicking through past Facebook
photos of my college journey and
bawl my eyes out. I can't help but
be upset that I'll no longer be a
Michigan student anymore and
that Ann Arbor will no longer be
my home.
For the first time in my life, I
don't have a plan. I don't have a job
lined up or any real agenda when it
comes to the next few months. The
non-structured life that I'm about
to enter scares me more than the
creepy little girl from "The Ring."
At the end of the
day, Ann Arbor
raised me.
Despite feeling all of that
though, I'll refrain from acting
like the world is coming to an
end. Instead, I'll pick my head
up and reminisce with elation
that I was blessed to be a Michi-
gan Wolverine. For I'm thankful
for the wonderful friendships that
were formed, the beautiful mem-
ories that were made, the knowl-
edge my professors provided me
and for the person my University
experience made me become.
I will miss Ann Arbor every
day - it will always be one of my
favorite cities on the planet. At the
end of the day, it was essentially
what raised me. I came here as a
girl, and I'm leaving as a woman.
I don't know where I'm going, I
don't know what life has in store
for me and I'm starting to come to
the realization that that's OK.
It's true, what they say - you
never really know what you've got
until it's gone. I'm not ready to say
goodbye, but I don't think I ever
truly will be. It's time to close
this chapter of my life with no
regrets, and smile about the fact
that no matter what I'll always
be a Michigan Wolverine. I will
end my final piece with a quote I
have engraved on my bracelet that
I wear everyday, "Wherever you
go, go with all of your heart - and
forever go blue."

Beck said he was disappoint-
ed that, due to lack of interest,
he was unable to set up a field

have been given the opportunity

ever, he said he hopes that the

The increased presence began
on July 26 when AAPD announced
that it was investigating DeWolf's
death as a homicide, Brown said.
While there is no end date to the
heightened security, she said
patrols would likely return to

"If I get the field school

Toolkit connects
mutation carriers
with extended family
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
While genetic testing has long
provided people with an idea about
their susceptibility to certain
diseases and conditions, there has
been no specific way of sharing
that information with genetic
relatives until now.
A multi-departmental study
at the University is piloting the
use of the Family Gene Toolkit, a
program in which patients who
have mutations that increase the
risk of cancer - as confirmed
by genetic testing - are given
assistance contacting family
members who are also at risk.
Currentlythestudyonlyfocuses
on two mutations - BRCA
and BRCA2 - whose presence
indicates an increased risk of
breast and ovarian cancer for
women, prostate cancer for men
and other forms in both genders.
Associate Nursing Prof. Maria
Katapodi, principal investigator
for the Toolkit, said in the past
she has often found patients who
received genetic testing that
exposed certain mutations would
only share their news with their
immediate family, if anyone,
leaving distant and second degree
relatives uninformed even when
they are still at high risk of also
having the mutation.
Katapodi said this creates a two-
fold problem: first, more distant
family members don't get the
information they need to prevent
the disease and, second, having the
patient pass the news is less reliable
andcanleadtofurtherconfusionor
problems within the family.
"Genetic information is
complicated information," she
said.
Katapodi said Family Gene
Toolkit works by orchestrating
the conversation between the
patient and the family members;

the patient with the mutation
meets with the high-risk relative
twice over a webinar with Toolkit
staff present and discusses the
situation. Then the participant
and family member have follow-up
phone calls with a nurse.
Katapodi said they are focusing
mostly on only contacting high-
risk family members and only
dealing with participants wii
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
Katapodi said the trial stage
lasted for about a year starting last
February and the program is now
in the testing process.
"They have this trusted source
where we explain what this
means for them and help facilitate
processing this information," she
said.
However, sharing possibly life-
changing information to someone
who did not seek testing remains
relatively controversial.
But Katapodi said the
mutations the Toolkit program
examines are not deterministic,
meaning having the mutation
alone doesn't confirm a person
will get the disease.
She added that the Family
Gene Toolkit does not conduct or
advocate for genetic testing, only
dealing with participants who
have already received testing
elsewhere.
"For people, it's good to have
the choice," Katapodi said. "Once
they hear the information they
can choose, 'Well what do I want
to do with this information?' And
that is perfectly acceptable; we
all respect an informed choice."
Sofia Merajver, professor in the
School of Medicine and School of
Public Health, has worked along
with Katapodi and others on the
project as a clinician.
Merajver said family members
were generally receptive to being
sought out and getting the full
information.
"Most humans are curious about
their own destiny," Merajver said.
"We can give them information
that hopefully powers them to
utilize that risk information to act
intheirown lifestyle."
