The Fred C. Shure Lounge 

and Engineering Learning 
Center in the Bob and Betty 
Beyster Building on North 
Campus is no longer all work 
and no play. 

A 
lone-standing 
arcade 

system 
— 
called 
the 

MichiGames arcade — has 
been installed and is now 
used to showcase student-
made video games.

Despite 
its 
appearance, 

the 
MichiGames 
arcade 

differs 
from 
traditional 

gaming units. The arcade 
system features four Xbox-
esque 
controllers 
instead 

of joysticks, which allow 
for 
more 
complex 
and 

sophisticated 
gaming, 

including 
the 
option 
for 

multiplayer.

Currently, 
the 
system 

hosts five games — three 
made in the fall 2016 EECS 
494 class, Game Design and 
Implementation, 
and 
two 

others created earlier this 
year at Wolverine Software’s 
Game 
Jam, 
an 
annual 

competition 
where 
teams 

have 48 hours to create a 
complete video game.

MichiGames arcade was 

first developed by Austin 
Yarger, 
an 
Engineering 

graduate student and EECS 
494 instructor.

In December of 2007, the 

Pinellas County School Board 
of 
Pinellas 
County, 
Fla., 

discontinued its integration 
policy. Violence and a decline 
in student performance struck 
the school systems, and in 
2015, the Tampa Bay Times 
released “Failure Factories,” a 
five-part investigation of the 
effects on both students and 
the community.

As part of The Livingston 

Lectures 
and 
the 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. Symposium, 
Lisa 
Gartner, 
Michael 

LaForgia 
and 
Nathaniel 

Lash, 
lead 
reporters 
of 

the investigation and 2016 
Livingston Award winners, 
joined Prof. Tabbye Chavous 
as well as moderator Prof. 
Brian 
Jacob 
for 
a 
panel 

Wednesday afternoon at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
to discuss the investigation 
itself. 
The 
speakers 
also 

spoke about the reforms and 
changes in policy that have 
resulted from the national 
recognition of the issue.

The 
investigation 
began 

with 
Gartner 
and 
Cara 

Fitzpatrick, 
also 
of 
the 

Tampa 
Bay 
Times, 
when 

they noticed differences in 
test scores between students 
among local schools. Cara 
had previous experience with 
four 
other 
large 
districts 

in Florida before reporting 

for the Tampa Bay Times, 
and had noticed that Black 
students in Pinellas had lower 
standardized test scores than 
those in the other school 
districts she had covered.

“Simultaneously, Lisa, who 

had come from Washington, 
was interested in looking 
at the punishment of Black 
children in our schools, in 
particular young Black kids,” 
LaForgia said. “She requested 

some data that showed that 
young Black kids in our school 
district were being punished 
at rates that far outstripped 
the rates that white kids were 
being punished. It seemed 
like they were being punished 
more harshly for minor, hard 
to define offenses.”

When they began their 

research, their data showed 
even more striking results. 
They found in the Pinellas 

school district, 84 percent of 
Black 
elementary 
students 

were 
failing 
state 
exams. 

As the schools continued to 
become more segregated, the 
test scores of their students 
continued to decline.

“Today they score worse 

than 
any 
school 
in 
the 

county,” LaForgia said. “They 
score 
worse 
than 
almost 

any school in the state. Ten 

LSA 
Student 
Government 

voted on a resolution Wednesday 
evening to change the current 
textbook used in Arabic classes at 
the University of Michigan. The 
resolution passed unanimously, 
with 28 votes for and zero against 
or abstaining.

The 
book 
in 
question 
is 

called “al-Kitaab fii Ta’allum 
al-Arabiyya” 
— 
commonly 

referred to as “al-Kitaab” — 
which translates to “The Book 
in the Learning of Arabic.” 
The authors of the resolution 
are representatives LSA senior 
Ibtihal Makki and LSA juniors 
Nicholas Fadanelli and Ryan 
Gillerist, who also published a 
petition earlier this month on the 
issue.

According to the resolution, 

students take issue with the 
textbook because they believe it 
is highly politicized, which they 
think violates LSA’s promise to 
respect other cultures. When 
introducing 
the 
resolution, 

Gillerist outlined what he called 
the “problematic” nature of the 
textbook.

Faculty panel clarifies questions on immigration ban following demonstration

Hundreds 
of 
students, 

faculty and staff filled the 
lobby of the Ross School of 
Business on Wednesday for 

#OneRoss, 
a 
demonstration 

showing 
solidarity 
and 

support 
for 
international 

students affected by President 
Donald Trump’s controversial 
executive ordersigned into law 
last Friday. The order restricts 
entry to the United States for 
citizens 
of 
seven 
majority-

Muslim countries for 90 days, 

even if they are dual-citizens, 
and suspends refugee programs 
for 120 days.

The 
demonstration 
lasted 

about 20 minutes, during which 
participants — many of whom 
were students who had left class 
to attend — packed the stairway 
and lobby of the Business School 
and listened to Ross Dean Scott 

Derue and Business graduate 
student Jerry Won, president of 
the Ross Student Government 
Association, speak. Attendees 
distributed and wore red pins 
representing cultural tolerance 
and racial diversity.

Dialogue 
Series 
hosted 
a 

workshop Wednesday night 
on the intersection between 
feminism and environmental 
justice. About 15 students and 
Ann Arbor residents shared 
their experiences and opinions 
in a roundtable discussion 
at the Trotter Multicultural 
Center.

The 
program 
originated 

last fall in the Sustainable 
Living

community 
in 
the 
Oxford 

residence hall. According to 
the group’s Facebook page, the 
organization aims to connect 
individuals who are “interested 
in 
learning 
more 
about 

Environmental Justice, or how 
environmental 
degradation 

disproportionately 
burdens 

low-income 
and 
majority 

black/brown communities.”

The dialogue series started 

last September. This month’s 
dialogue, as pointed out by 
attendees, was held the on

faculty held a dialogue on the 
ban later in the day featuring 
immigration 
lawyers 
and 

University of Michigan faculty.

Though 
no 
specific 
plan 

for the protection of students 
with refugee status has been 
released by the administration, 
as requested by a petition 
signed by more than 1,400 
students, faculty and staff, 
the 
International 
Center 

issued 
a 
statement 
with 

recommendations for students 
who may be impacted.

Echoing sentiments from a 

statement made by University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel, 

Derue stated that there was 
still considerable uncertainty 
around the implications of the 
executive order but reaffirmed 
solidarity and support, as well 
as a commitment to keeping 
the Business School a safe and 
diverse environment.

“We are from the U.S., 

we are from Iran, we are 
from Somalia,” Derue said, 
mentioning two of the seven 
majority-Muslim 
countries 

from which entry into the 
United 
States 
has 
been 

suspended. 
“We 
are 
all 

global citizens, and we will 
demonstrate an unwavering 
commitment to a diverse and 
equitable community where 
we can all come together, live 
together and work together.”

First-year 
MBA 
student 

Rachel 
DeLeon 
helped 

organize the event and told 
the Daily that the purpose 
of #OneRoss was to support 
fellow students affected by the 
executive order.

“We have classmates that 

are going to be affected by 
this,” Deleon said. “We want to 
represent love and support for 
(them).”

In an email sent to the Ross 

student body, Won included 
a 
personal 
statement 
from 

Business 
graduate 
student 

Banafsheh Bagheri, an Iranian-
Canadian whose travel has 
been severely restricted.

“If I left the country, I may 

have to say goodbye to Ross, 
I may have to say goodbye to 
the career I have been working 
so hard on, I may have to say 
goodbye to the future I’m 
building for myself,” Bagheri 

said. “Not being able to leave 
the country means that I won’t 
be able to see my family, that 
they won’t be able to visit me.”

In 
the 
evening, 
the 

Ross 
Student 
Government 

Association organized an open 
panel 
to 
address 
concerns 

and 
questions 
from 
the 

community. 
Approximately 

100 people attended the panel 
which included immigration 
lawyers as well as University of 

Michigan officials and faculty.

The panel advised students, 

faculty and staff on travel 
plans and how to address the 
swift change in immigration 
policy. 
Panelists 
included 

Michael Carlin, an Ann Arbor 
area immigration attorney and 
University 
officials 
Donica 

Varner, from the Office of the 
Vice President and General 
Counsel, and Scott Manley 
from the International Center.

The panel began by informing 

the audience on the definition 
and scope of an executive order 
and what this particular order 
means for University students. 
The 
panel 
discussed 
how 

the order essentially revokes 
existing visas and may have 
residual 
effects, 
disrupting 

travel plans for those affected 
into the summer.

The 
main 
message 
to 

anyone 
from 
the 
listed 

countries was not to leave the 
United States, but instead, 
the 
panel 
emphasized 

vigilance regardless of where 
students are from. The panel 
advised travelers to have an 
immigration attorney on call 
and told students to carry all 
forms of documentation that 

they could — even a transcript.

“We speak to CBP (Customs 

and 
Border 
Protection) 

officials on a weekly basis and 
sometimes all they are looking 
for is that you’re a degree-
seeking 
student 
in 
good 

standing,” Manley said.

Panelists also outlined the 

logistical grievances of the 
order.

“Individuals that had to 

enforce this at the point of 
entry had no clue,” Varner 
said. “The confusion and chaos 
has been in the roll out.”

Later, the room was opened 

for discussion and the audience 
could ask specific questions 
in an effort to quell their 
uncertainties. 
Though 
the 

panelists could provide helpful 
advice to some, a common 
answer was: “I do not know.”

Business 
senior 
Michael 

Yashaya, president of the Ross 
Student Government Bachelor 
of 
Business 
Administration 

Council, explained how the 
immediate implementation of 
the order was dealt with by the 
SGA.

“The 
nature 
of 
how 

everything was executed left 
us with very little time, but we 

wanted to make sure that any 
student who had any questions 
could attend a forum where 
those concerns were able to 
be voiced in front of experts,” 
Yashaya said. 

Some students in the audience 

declined to be interviewed by 
the Daily, citing an email that 
told them to direct all media 
questions to University officials 
and the personal nature of the 
effects the executive order has.

Business graduate student 

Ricardo 
Dancuart 
was 

concerned about the state of 
affairs but expressed thanks 
to the community for all of its 
support.

“I am not from a country 

that is having a problem right 
now, but I am from South 
America and maybe today I’m 
all right, but I don’t know if 
tomorrow there’s going to be 
a problem,” Dancuart said. 
“There has been a lot of support 
from the community, not only 
from the dean but also from 
other students. Even from my 
classmates there were some 
very nice messages going on. 
That was a very good gesture 
from the University and its 
students.”

“It turns out that there 

are a lot of people around 
here making games,” Yarger 
said. “They are this beautiful 
combination of engineering, 
art, music, design and writing, 
but we noticed a problem. 
Students who were putting 
their hearts and souls in 
their games, they get played 
at the showcase at the end 
of the semester, and then 
disappeared. They end up 
up in some dusty hard drive 
somewhere.”

The cabinet for the arcade 

was purchased and donated 
by 
University 
alum 
Todd 

Newman, with funding for 
internal work provided by 
the Departmental Computing 

Organization of EECS.

The current games hosted 

on the system consist of three 
competitive action racers and 
two tricky puzzles, though 
there 
are 
more 
to 
come, 

according to Yarger, who, in 
addition to developing the 
system, is its sole curator.

“Making a game for an 

arcade 
is 
actually 
quite 

different than a computer or 
system,” Yarger said. “I go 
around to the Game Jams and 
showcases and find games 
that could be adapted to our 
system, but are also popular, 
the ones people want to play.”

Besides offering a break 

in 
between 
classes, 
the 

system 
has 
also 
sparked 

the imagination of students 
around campus. Engineering 
senior Antonio Fernandez is 
looking forward to discovering 

what additions could be made 
to the current system.

“(I’d like to see) some kind of 

virtual reality, maybe gloves, 
so that you could move the 
characters without using the 
buttons or sticks,” Fernandez 
said. 

Engineering junior Thomas 

Bartlett, is the developer of 
“Agent O’Hare,” one of the 
games available to play in the 
cabinet, is excited about his 
game reaching the public.

“Prior to putting the game 

in the MichiGames cabinet, 
the only people who had really 
played it were the other sleep-
deprived developers at the 
Game Jam event,” Bartlett 
said. 
“Having 
the 
game 

available to the whole public 
anytime seemed like a great 
way to make sure our hard 
work wasn’t for nothing.”

ARCADE

Florida 
elementary 
schools 

have 
similar 
failure 
rates. 

Take 
away 
privately 
run 

charters, and there are eight, 
take away schools for children 
with disabilities or behavioral 
problems, and there are six, 
take away a non-traditional 
early learning center, and look 
what’s left. The five elementary 
schools in Pinellas county’s 
Black neighborhoods.”

To 
supplement 
the 

educational data, they found 
violence in the schools has 
also been on the rise. They 
continually 
heard 
stories 

from 
parents 
stating 
that 

their children were having 
difficulty learning because 
of violence and disruption 
in the classroom, hallways 
and overall school climate. 
One mother described to the 
reporters the degree to which 
her daughter was bullied in 
school.

“She ended up laying down 

in the car pickup line in the 
path of oncoming cars and 
telling the teacher that she 
didn’t want to live anymore,” 
LaForgia said. “We found 
that children at these schools 
have been shoved, slapped, 
punched or kicked more than 
7,500 times since 2010. The 
equivalent of eight times a 
day, every day, for five years 
straight.”

They found the inclusion 

of personal stories like these 
to be crucial in crafting a 
distinctive account of the 
incidents 
students 
and 

parents face on a day-to-day 
basis. Gartner was at the head 
of 
interviewing 
people 
to 

validate data, and found the 
statements she received to be 

extremely helpful.

“The human storytelling 

we did for ‘Failure Factories’ 
went a long way, I think, in 
turning that data and these 
policy decisions into realities 
that played out for real people 
struggling to get their kids not 
even an amazing education, 
but an adequate education,” 
Gartner said.

Since 
the 
time 
of 
the 

investigation, several policy 
changes have been made at 
all levels of the educational 
system. At the district level, 
an eight-person team was 
hired to oversee the schools 
in the district, re-interviews 
have been held for all teachers 
and a minority achievement 
officer has been hired. They 
also 
reduced 
the 
allowed 

number of days that students 
can be suspended and opened 
centers for these suspended 
students to receive tutors and 
counseling. At the federal 

level, 
the 
Department 
of 

Education 
opened 
a 
civil 

rights investigation into the 
district.

“Arne 
Duncan, 
the 

Secretary of Education, and 
his 
successor 
John 
King 

came 
down 
to 
Campbell 

Park 
Elementary,” 
Gartner 

said. “They spoke there and 
put a lot of pressure on the 
superintendent. They called 
what had been done there 
‘education malpractice’ and a 
‘mandated disaster.’ ”

Education junior Gabrielle 

Rubinstein 
attended 
the 

discussion and highlighted the 
importance of understanding 
the issues that affect schools 
around the country.

“This 
specific 
situation 

that they’re talking about is 
something that is happening 
all over, and I was really 
interested 
in 
hearing 
the 

journalistic perspective of it,” 
Rubinstein said. “Usually you 
don’t hear about that because 
there are many sides that come 
to issues with education, so 
it’s important to hear all sides 
to find out the real truth.”

Abbie Stull, also a junior in 

the School of Education, found 
the panel to be informative in 
relation to the process of the 
investigation.

“The overview that they 

gave at the beginning was very 
helpful to understanding the 
entire process that they went 
through,” she said. “I thought 
it was just great overall; it 
talked a lot about education in 
that school specifically, and I 
felt that I learned a lot about 
that situation.”

was ordered to push through 
and finish the Dakota Access 
Pipeline. 
According 
to 

reports, protests have been 
concentrated near Lake Oahe, 
a segment of the Missouri 
River, in recent days. Many 
University 
students 
have 

spoken out against the pipeline.

Facilitator 
Noor 
Ahmad, 

an LSA senior, outlined the 
history of ecofeminism for 
the group. The movement, she 
said, began in the late 70s and 
early 80s in academic spheres 
and centers around the brief 
that in order to push back 
against 
female 
oppression, 

combating climate change and 
environmental decay is an 
important step.

The 
workshop 
began 
by 

comparing 
the 
relationship 

between the female gender 
and environmental issues such 
as fracking and oil pipelines. 
Detroit resident Lane Lewis 
said 
these 
infrastructures 

resemble the pressure put on 
women to continually provide 

for the world.

“There’s a lack of language 

for our responsibility to the 
earth, and even that ‘mother’ 
language is frustrating to me 
because it suggests a maternal 
giving and giving and giving 
and giving,” Lewis said. “I 
think that it’s important that 
we realize it’s not an unlimited 
resource.”

Engineering 
graduate 

student 
Josh 
Woods 
said 

Americans should not sacrifice 
technological advancement on 
the whole when attempting 
to 
combat 
environmental 

damages.

“I find that whole talk 

about 
consent 
and 
giving 

agency to the earth, it seems 
like muddling of the waters 
a little bit,” Woods said. “I 
wouldn’t want that to hamper 
any advancement on any level 
unless it’s going to pollute the 
waters with something like 
Standing Rock.”

The 
discussion 
migrated 

to climate change and its 
effect on women all across the 
world. Issues such as lack of 
representation in politics and 
negative health effects were 

also brought up.

According to the United 

Nations 
Framework 

Convention on Climate Change 
website, 
“Women’s 
unequal 

participation 
in 
decision-

making processes and labour 
markets compound inequalities 
and often prevent women from 
fully contributing to climate-
related 
planning, 
policy-

making and implementation.”

Rackham 
student 
Teona 

Williams said while she was 
conducting research in Kenya, 
she noticed first-hand how 
women will be affected by 
climate change because of 
their work on farms around the 
world.

“I was researching in Kenya 

where there’s mostly women 
farmers but they don’t own 
the land. They don’t own 
the product they produce,” 
Williams said. “They physically 
are close to the land. Then we 
think of things like climate 
change and that’s why they’re 
going to face the brunt of those 
impact because they are doing 
that natural labor.”

The night concluded with a 

guided meditation session.

FEMINISM
From Page 1A

We are all global 
citizens, and we 
will demonstrate 
an unwavering 
commitment 
to a diverse 
and equitable 
community

The human 

storytelling we 
did for ‘Failure 
Factories’ went a 
long way, I think, 
in turning that 
data and these 
policy decisions 

into realities

“The textbook that’s used 

in the Arabic program, as well 
as 96 percent of the Arabic 
programs around the country 
... it’s politically charged,” she 
said. “By the end of the first 
semester, you’re able to say, ‘My 
grandfather was a general in 
the army, my mother is a human 
rights lawyer who specialized in 
the Middle East’ but you can’t 
say, ‘My cat is orange.”

Makki, the main author of 

the resolution, is the daughter 
of Lebanese immigrants. She 
believes the textbook needs to 
be replaced, and pointed out the 
seemingly backward order in 
which the book teaches Arabic 
vocabulary.

“The problem isn’t the words; 

the words are not bad in essence,” 
she said. “The problem is that 

you’re learning to say (United 
Nations and army general) before 
you learn how to say the colors, 
and the days of the week, and the 
months of the year; things that 
you would need if you were to go 
to an Arabic-speaking country 
and try to get around or try to 
communicate with people. You 
would need to know how to say 
these basic vocabulary words, 
which is how other languages 
at this university are taught. It’s 
making it seem like if you were to 
go to the Arabic world, you would 
probably talk about politics more 
than you would ask someone if 
they want to get lunch.”

Makki also takes issue with 

the 
website 
corresponding 

with the textbook, which she 
says portrays Arabs in a very 
stereotypical light.

“There’s an online component 

where you watch videos and the 
characters in it are represented 
in a very Orientalist way, where 

the women who are college-aged 
are not allowed to leave their 
house,” she said. “They only have 
aspirations to be stay-at-home 
moms.”

While Makki acknowledges 

many students take Arabic with 
intentions of using the skill for 
political purposes, she believes 
there should be a separate class 
for students wishing to expand 
their 
political 
vocabulary. 

This way, people like Makki 
who simply want to learn the 
language for the sake of learning 
the language don’t have to 
be subjected to the political 
“framework” that is being forced 
upon them with the current 
textbook.

Fadanelli 
also 
pointed

hetoric 
since 
the 

inauguration has not only 
perpetuated a narrative 

that Donald Trump is not a 
legitimate 
president, 

but has also invoked 
fear as a would-be 
mandate that those of 
us who merely hear its 
words might be called 
to action. A productive 
dialogue has not been 
encouraged; 
rather, 

the left has focused 
on unilateral criticism 
and a hateful rebuke of 
Donald Trump.

I listened, incredulously, to the 

words Ashley Judd and Madonna 
selected for their speeches at the 
Women’s March the day after 
we, as a country, celebrated our 
peaceful transition of power — a 
hallmark of our democracy. I felt 
somewhat embarrassed by, at the 
very least, their lack of civility. The 
speeches suggested that Trump 
bathes in Cheeto dust, that he has 
traded a “Hitlerian” mustache for a 
toupee, and that we, the American 
public, must refuse “to accept this 
new age of tyranny,” in which 
“being uniquely different right now 
might truly be considered a crime.” 
Such incendiary and insulting 
rhetoric complements a dialogue 
that attempts to represent Trump’s 
presidency as illegitimate.

This 
type 
of 
rhetoric 

deliberately 
invokes 
feelings 

of mistrust, vulnerability and 
protest. 
Notwithstanding 
the 

value of a women’s march as an 
opportunity for dialogue and 
solidarity on behalf of shared views 
and values, remarks like these 
were a call to action to those who 
did not vote for our 45th president 
and to those inclined to join an 
ever-growing voice inspired by 
an insurgency. One need look 
no further than Saul Alinsky’s 
“Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic 
Primer for Realistic Radicals” to 
appreciate the collective action and 
antagonistic tactics at the core of 
the “not my president” agenda.

Here’s 
the 
problem: 
This 

proclamation of illegitimacy is not 
merely mythological — it further 
divides America, even though 
its advocates seek to assign sole 
accountability for divisiveness to 
Trump. Similar to Hillary Clinton’s 
comment that 50 percent of Trump 

supporters can be put in a “basket 
of deplorables,” the contention 
that Trump is not a legitimate 
president effectively questions the 

authenticity of nearly 
half of the American 
public who voted for 
him and for change. 
These 
Americans 

included 
decent 

people with diverse 
backgrounds 
and 

religious beliefs from 
varied cultures and 
races.

On 
“Meet 
the 

Press” 
two 
days 

after the inauguration, Kellyanne 
Conway, 
counselor 
to 
the 

president, introduced the dubious 
concept of “alternative facts” to 
challenge reports that Trump’s 
inauguration was far less attended 
than Barack Obama’s. Sadly, both 
she and Sean Spicer, Trump’s 
press secretary, remind me of the 
famous quote from Shakespeare’s 
Hamlet, “The lady doth protest too 
much, methinks.” In contesting 
media reports comparing Trump 
and Obama’s inaugural attendance 
numbers or presidential approval 
ratings, for that matter, Spicer and 
Conway seem ready and willing to 
dispute the claims of illegitimacy, 
and in doing so, they make them 
appear relevant. Trump similarly 
appears to seek legitimacy in 
suggesting that he lost the popular 
vote 
because 
of 
voter fraud. 

However, instead of giving credence 
to skeptics of his popularity, he 
needs to remember that the results 
of the popular vote are irrelevant 
since in our system the Electoral 
College determines who wins the 
presidency.

President 
Trump 
and 
his 

advisers need not tune into the 
noise of insurgency if it insists on 
using foul, antagonistic language 
to spread unsubstantiated fear 
of tyranny or imminent loss of 
constitutional rights. When Bill 
Clinton beat Bush senior, when 
George W. Bush beat Clinton and 
when Obama took office eight 
years ago, a significant number of 
Americans saw their candidates 
lose, yet shared optimism, for 
social and economic progress was 
the basis, at least in theory, for 
offering hopeful support.

I dare say that public outrage on 

par with what we have witnessed 

since the inauguration of Trump 
would have been rebuked strongly 
by the media and many Americans 
had 
this 
occurred 
following 

Obama’s inauguration. Trump’s 
early executive orders to build a 
wall, rollback the Affordable Care 
Act and his most recent travel 
decree are evidence of not only 
his authenticity, but also of his 
embrace of his legitimate position.

Similarly, Trump’s most recent 

proffering of uniquely qualified 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Neil 

Gorsuch and his deliberate and 
strategic selection of his cabinet 
reflect his legitimacy. Furthermore, 
the Electoral College proved his 
legitimacy by electing him as 
president. 
When 
interviewed 

on ABC on Jan. 24, Trump 
acknowledged his own belief that 
torture and waterboarding work, 
but unequivocally stated that he 
would defer to CIA Director Mike 
Pompeo and Defense Secretary 
General James Mattis on such 
issues. I ask you, if this does not 
resemble legitimacy, what does?

Sure, Trump’s own rhetoric has 

been, and likely will continue to 
be, incendiary. But, so too is the 
rhetoric — often hypocritical and 
inflammatory — of those who cling 
to identity politics and behave with 
antagonism. Messages like Judd’s 
and 
Madonna’s 
are 
proffered 

expressly to incite fear and to 
dampen optimism for economic 
and social change that prompted 
many Americans to elect Trump. 
Mutuality and collaboration are the 
way forward; alternative facts, by 
either the right or the left, are not.

President 
Trump 
is 

unquestionably a work in progress. 
Our democracy affords us with the 
First Amendment right to freedom 
of speech. So, though I tire of the 
too often specious criticism of 
Trump and its hateful rhetoric, 
it will strengthen his resolve to 
deliver favorable results for all 
Americans. In other words, the 
endless protest and rebuke that I 
anticipate over the next four years 
will likely foster his execution of 
his vision — which got him elected. 
Hope is the only thing stronger 
than fear. So, for the sake of our 
great democracy, let’s agree on the 
mythology of illegitimacy.

Internship blues

LAUREN SCHANDEVEL | COLUMN

M

ost days, my college 
education truly feels 
like the great equalizer. 

The University of Michigan is 
home to the children 
of doctors, lawyers 
and artists; children 
who grew up taking 
exotic vacations and 
boarding at expensive 
schools; children who 
know the function of 
the smaller outer fork 
in a table set — and it 
is, by some miracle, 
my home, too.

Together 
we 

complain about exams, 
immerse 
ourselves 

in student organizations, hunch 
over our homework with coffee 
in hand, willingly engaging in an 
unspoken inter-class camaraderie 
every day. However, there are 
drawbacks to attending a school 
where the median family income 
of its students exceeds the value of 
my house; subtle reminders that, 
while I may share spaces with the 
elite, I do not always share their 
opportunities. And each time 
summer rolls around, it never fails 
to jolt me back to reality.

To put it bluntly, my parents 

don’t see the merit of unpaid 
internships. To them, working 
for free seems outrageous — a 
complete waste of time. After all, 
how am I supposed to pay off my 
student loans if I don’t save up 
what I earn during the summer?

After dropping out of commu-

nity college, my dad waited tables 
and worked as a disc jockey on the 
side before landing in the central 
supply unit of St. John Hospital 
in Detroit. My mom, on the other 
hand, grew up on a farm in small-
town Michigan and worked four 
jobs in high school and college to 
pay for her associate’s degree in sec-
retarial science. For a time, she was 
a medical transcriptionist (that’s 
how I learned the term endoscopic 
retrograde 
cholangiopancreatog-

raphy), before bouncing around 

during the recession in 2008 and 
ending up in specimen processing at 
the Detroit Medical Center.

In the months leading up to the 

end of winter semester, 
it is an uphill battle of 
explanation. I need the 
experience. I can’t work 
full-time at a restaurant. 
I know my boss told me 
I could come back and 
bus tables any time, 
but I don’t want to. The 
University 
gives 
out 

scholarships for interns. 
No, you don’t have to pay 
for it.
Last 
summer, 
I 

convinced them to let 

me stay in Ann Arbor to work 
on a congressional campaign. 
This summer, they want me at 
home. While my friends scatter 
themselves across the globe — 
traveling, camping, taking coveted 
positions in D.C. — I will retreat 
to the one place where I have 
complete financial security: my 
dingy, unremarkable suburb. So 
much for leveling the playing field.

As much as it sucks, my 

experience is commonplace for 
lower-income 
students 
pining 

after glamorous summer plans, 
and it isn’t just a matter of funding 
them, either. We know there are 
resources. Believe us, we’ve scoured 
the 
scholarship 
websites 
and 

could probably recite verbatim the 
descriptions of specific scholarship 
packages to you. No, a lot of our 
struggle has to do with guilt. Some 
of us have to work to provide for our 
families; others simply cannot get 
their parents to warm up to the idea 
(“You’re away during the school 
year, why do you have to leave for 
the summer, too? We miss you!”).

So each year, while our peers 

gain valuable experience in their 
respective fields, we unwillingly 
set ourselves back — because, 
not surprisingly, employers will 
almost always take the guy who 
wrote policy memos for four 
months on Capitol Hill over the 

girl who worked in the stockroom 
at her local Kroger.

While the University does all 

it can to provide students with 
financial resources for internships, 
most scholarship packages only 
cover the cost of housing and food 
for the duration of the program, 
which nets zero by the end of the 
summer. For those of us with 
families who may not understand 
the experiential value of unpaid 
work, it is almost impossible 
to convince them that working 
for free in our field of interest is 
ultimately more beneficial in the 
long run than laboring at a service 
job for minimum wage.

I implore the University to 

consider the barriers low-income 
students encounter when seeking 
internships 
and 
subsequently 

train advisers to understand and 
accommodate this. Whether that 
entails connecting them with 
paid options or simply preparing 
them for conversations with their 
parents on the subject, a little 
consideration can go a long way.

Once the dorms close for the 

summer, not everyone has the 
means to continue their education 
outside of the classroom; some are 
forced to withdraw to a reality that 
is worlds away from the luxuries 
of campus. And when you are 
consistently knocked back on your 
ass every May after spending a 
school year steadily advancing 
with your peers, things can seem 
pretty hopeless and unfair.

For many, the months between 

winter and fall semester serve as 
a painful reminder that, while 
they may rub elbows with their 
wealthier 
counterparts 
eight 

months out of the year, matching or 
even outdoing them in academics, 
they will never quite fit in with 
them. It is an inequality that is 
overlooked and under-appreciated, 
and one that will always cause me 
to dread the arrival of spring.

The mythology of illegitimacy

FROM THE DAILY

Make the U more affordable

O

n Jan. 18, The New York Times’ The Upshot published a report 
with statistics detailing variation in student income on college 
campuses in the United States. The statistics reveal the University 

of Michigan’s disproportionately high number of wealthy students on 
campus. Sixty-six percent of students come from the wealthiest 20 percent 
of Americans, and only 3.6 percent come from the poorest 20 percent. The 
study fundamentally illustrates that the University is not doing enough to 
promote socioeconomic diversity on campus. The University must do more 
to promote socioeconomic diversity by more actively promoting financial 
aid and scholarships, as well as work to retain students once they come to 
the University through more affordable living. 

The 
University’s 
current 

policies to assist low-income 
students only go so far. While 
the HAIL scholarship, which 
provides full-ride scholarships 
to high-achieving, low-income 
students, is certainly a good 
start, it focuses on alleviating 
the student debt of a select 
few, rather than increasing 
socioeconomic 
diversity 

overall. 
Furthermore, 
the 

University must make sure 
that it is doing its part to make 
students more aware of the 
possible financial aid that is 
available to them. Financial 
aid documents are also long 
and often confusing, requiring 
months of rigorous financial 
work to grant students access 
to necessary assistance; the 
University 
needs 
to 
give 

students more tools to help 
them fill out these long and 
complicated forms to get the aid 
they need. In the 2011-2012 year, 
2 million students qualified for 
federal aid, but about 14 percent 
of students didn’t know how to 
apply and 9 percent said it was 
too much work to apply. What’s 
more, the CSS profile is another 
requirement the University has 
for students who wish to apply 
for grants and scholarships, an 
even more comprehensive and 
detailed set of forms students 
applying for any University aid 
must fill out.

In light of the Diversity, 

Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
plan, 

the University must work to 
make campus more affordable 
once students have arrived, 
otherwise 
the 
DEI’s 
main 

goal to create a better campus 
climate won’t be enough to 
attract and retain students 
of 
low 
socioeconomic 

backgrounds. We also believe 

that the University must take a 
more active role in alleviating 
external 
costs 
that 
may 

create barriers to low-income 
students. A study by the Urban 
Institute shows that four-year 
institution 
room-and-board 

costs are growing significantly. 
While 
on-campus 
housing 

used to provide students with 
cheaper housing, this report 
shows it is now only 7 percent 
cheaper to live on-campus.

This problem is especially 

salient 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
as 

increasingly 
unaffordable 

housing creates obstacles for 
students who already find it 
difficult to pay their tuition. 
Compared to other Big Ten 
schools, on-campus housing at 
the University is on the more 
expensive end of the spectrum. 
In 
fact, 
many 
University 

students 
live 
in 
Ypsilanti 

instead of Ann Arbor because 
of steadily growing housing 
costs in Ann Arbor. Increasing 
programs to assist in these 
additional 
expenses 
would 

decrease obstacles to students.

Other schools around the 

country have been doing a 
considerably 
better 
job 
at 

promoting 
socioeconomic 

diversity on their campuses 
through 
several 
different 

specialized programs. Denison 
University, Grinnell College, 
University 
of 
Southern 

California 
and 
Williams 

College 
allocate 
extensive 

amounts 
of 
funds 
toward 

highly specialized programs 
that help recruit lower-income 
students and offer assistance 
with admissions. Denison and 
Williams fly in thousands of low-
income students to tour their 
campuses and provide those 
students specialized assistance 

with 
applications 
free 
of 

charge. These initiatives can 
help explain why these colleges 
have 
greater 
socioeconomic 

diversity on campus.

In 1997, the state of Texas 

passed a bill in which the 
top 10 percent of students in 
each high school in Texas 
receive automatic admission 
to any public university in 
the state. Though the bill 
was later ammended to allow 
universities like the University 
of Texas at Austin to limit 
automatic admits to the top 
7 percent, this bill is still a 
good example for states and 
universites to follow. Although 
Texas’ 10 percent plan isn’t 
an entirely nuanced approach 
to 
increasing 
diversity 
on 

campus, it’s a step in the right 
direction in increasing lower-
income students’ access to top 
public universities.

We believe that the University 

has a duty to act as an agent of 
upward social mobility. The 
University should streamline 
the financial aid process by 
removing the CSS Profile, while 
supplementing and increasing 
funding 
for 
programs 
like 

the HAIL Scholarship that 
are aimed at recruiting and 
retaining students from lower 
socioeconomic status homes. 
Once 
students 
arrive 
on 

campus, the University must 
work to retain students by 
providing low-income students 
means to cover Ann Arbor’s 
lofty living costs. Diversity is 
what makes any institution 
strong, and without increased 
steps to improve socioeconomic 
diversity to make our campus 
welcoming for all students, 
the University risks remaining 
socioeconomically divided.

Lavigne draws from 
past, fights adversity

There 
wasn’t 
a 
specific 

play that Hayden Lavigne was 
injured on. Rather, it was the 
“accumulation of the game,” 
the result of facing 27 shots 
from then-No. 9 Minnesota, 
made only worse by improper 
care of his groin.

Regardless 
of 
how 
it 

happened, it felt tight after 
the game, and the freshman 
goaltender 
missed 
the 

Michigan hockey team’s series 
the 
next 
weekend 
against 

Michigan State.

It was the second stretch 

this season that Lavigne has 
missed extended time. The 
first took place over two weeks 
in 
November 

and December, 
when Lavigne 
was sick and 
missed 
both 

the 
series 

against 
Lake 

Superior State 
and then-No. 6 
Penn State.

Both 

the 
illness 

and 
injury 

couldn’t have 
happened at worse times for 
Lavigne. Before falling sick, he 
looked poised to grab the lead 
in 
Michigan’s 
still-ongoing 

goaltender 
competition. 
He 

had posted two shutouts in 
his first four starts and led the 
team in both save percentage 
and goals-allowed average by a 
wide margin.

When he returned from his 

first ailment in the Wisconsin 
series, the opening results 
weren’t pretty. He gave up six 
goals on 27 shots as Michigan 
suffered a 7-4 loss against the 
Badgers.

“I think he was getting 

confidence 
and 
momentum, 

and he got sick and he missed 
four games in a row,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“... It’s the same thing with any 
of our guys that are out for any 
time. If you’re out for a couple 
weeks, it’s tough to get your 
legs going and your head going 
and get your confidence back 
right away.”

Lavigne, though, recaptured 

some 
of 
his 
early-season 

momentum 
the 
following 

night. He saved 34 of 35 shots 
as the Wolverines salvaged a 
split against Wisconsin. Then, 
Lavigne stopped 36 shots in 
the Great Lakes Invitational, 
giving his team — in a game in 
which its offense went missing 
— a chance to beat Michigan 
Tech.

But as soon as he had gotten 

back on his feet, the Minnesota 
game 
and 
resulting 
injury 

followed. Now, Lavigne is back 
in the same position he found 
himself while sick: trying to 
fully recover while maintaining 
his level of play from earlier in 
the season.

Still, 
the 

adversity 
he’s 
faced 

this 
season 

is 
nothing 

compared 
to 
the 
path 

he 
took 
to 

Michigan.

After 

committing 
to 
Michigan 

in 2013, Lavigne spent nearly 
three years bouncing between 
teams in the United States 
Hockey League. He was cut 
from his first two teams — 
the Tri-City Storm and the 
Waterloo Black Hawks — all 
while 
Michigan’s 
coaching 

staff delayed his enrollment, 
waiting for Lavigne to emerge 
as the player they recruited.

At 
one 
point, 
while 

transitioning from one team 
to another, he sat in the stands 
for over a month, watching 
his team play without him. 
He eventually caught on with 
the 
Bloomington 
Thunder, 

putting up the best stats of his 
junior career, and joined the 
Wolverines this fall.

“Obviously, it’s not the same 

type of adversity I’ve been 
through, but at the same time, 
going through those trades 
and cuts taught me how to be 
mentally tough and deal with 

adversity,” Lavigne said. “…
That really taught me to be 
invested in practice and doing 
what I can, controlling what 
I can control, not stuff that’s 
outside of myself. Those things 
definitely prepared me for the 
injuries that I’ve had this year 
and the illnesses.”

Lavigne’s 
early 
successes 

surprised some because of 
his long-winding path to Ann 
Arbor. 
Senior 
goaltender 

Zach Nagelvoort is the most 
experienced of Michigan’s trio 
in net, while freshman Jack 
LaFontaine was a third-round 
pick by the NHL’s Carolina 
Hurricanes. Yet, Lavigne has 
arguably outplayed both when 
he’s been given the chance.

“Hayden’s done a nice job 

coming in here,” 
said 
assistant 

coach 
Billy 

Powers. “I think 
obviously 
his 

numbers 
bear 

that out. … I just 
think the start 
that he’s gotten 
off to is a credit 
to his ability to 
handle adversity 
and stay focused. 
That, clearly, I 

think has been an advantage 
for him having three years 
of junior experience. Clearly, 
all the work he put in prior to 
Michigan and dealing with the 
highs and the lows have really 
helped him be ready for this.

“... I would be willing to bet 

Hayden probably brushes small 
things off like nothing because 
he’s 
been 
through 
much 

worse.”

Added Berenson: “... I liked 

what 
(Lavigne) 
was 
doing 

in his early games. We had a 
bad team game in Vermont 
that didn’t help him any, but 
outside of that, I thought he 
was making progress. … Now, 
who was going to surface (in 
the starting competition), I 
don’t think we were in a rush at 
that point, but Hayden made a 
good first impression. Let’s put 
it that way.”

While it would be easy to 

imagine a freshman player 
fretting over whether he fell in 
the pecking order because of 
his illness and injury, Lavigne 
continues to remain unfazed. 
His struggles in the USHL have 
shaped him into the player he 
is today. A tight groin, after all, 
is a much different ordeal than 
spending three years in small 
Midwestern rinks waiting for 
your shot.

“I think that’s helped him 

a lot more than he knew at 
the time,” Berenson said. “He 
didn’t know at the time how 
this story was going to be 
played out, and I think now, his 
experience is going to be huge. 
Hopefully, he doesn’t have any 
more adversity this year, but 
what he’s gone through so far, 
he seems to have handled it 

pretty well.”

So 
Lavigne, 

equipped 
with 

the lessons of his 
junior 
travels, 

did 
what 
he 

knows best: He 
went 
back 
to 

work, 
whether 

it was rehabbing 
his 
groin 
or 

watching 
film. 

He 
started 

practicing 
once 
again 
this 

past week and may play this 
weekend against No. 11 Ohio 
State.

And once again, he’ll try to 

return to his early-season form 
— or better.

“I think I’ve just got to put 

that in the back of my head 
and know that that’s how I can 
play,” Lavigne said. “But at the 
same time, that’s the past and 
people are only going to look at 
how I finish the rest of the year. 
I don’t want to be that guy that 
started off really hot and fell 
apart.”

Added Berenson: “(Lavigne) 

knows he can do it. He’s got 
some confidence. … Of course, 
every day in practice is kinda 
like trying out for your position 
in the game. … We’ve got 
players that are trying out 
every day just to get into the 
lineup, and I think it’s a similar 
thing for Hayden.”

Evaluating the first half of 
Michigan’s Big Ten season

Last season, the Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
team 
flew 

through 
the 
first 
half 
of 

conference play en route to a 
7-2 record before subsequently 
managing just three victories 
over its final nine games. The 
Wolverines ultimately finished 
with a 10-8 conference record 
that secured them an eighth-
place finish in the Big Ten — the 
lowest of any team above .500 in 
conference play.

This season, Michigan (4-5 Big 

Ten, 14-8 overall) currently sits 
in a four-way tie for seventh place 
halfway through the conference 
season. The Wolverines lost 
only one of those games by 
double digits, against Illinois in 
Champaign on Jan. 11, but they 
also won only one by that margin 
— against Indiana at Crisler 
Center last Thursday.

While many of those contests 

came down to the wire and could 
have gone either way down the 
stretch, the bottom line is that 
Michigan didn’t do enough to 
win more games than it has lost.

Before the Wolverines kick off 

the second half of their Big Ten 
slate Saturday versus Ohio State, 
the Daily evaluates Michigan’s 
performance so far in 2017.

Offense: B+
Through 
their 
first 
nine 

games, the Wolverines have been 
carried by their offense. Boasting 
an average of 74.1 points per 
game — good for sixth-best in the 
conference — Michigan has the 
ability to score from anywhere 
on the court.

The Wolverines are shooting 

47.8 percent from the floor and 
38.8 percent from beyond the 
arc, ranking them second and 
fifth, respectively, in the Big 
Ten. They crossed the 90-point 
plateau twice, in wins over 
Nebraska and Indiana. While 
Michigan needed to score that 
many to beat the Cornhuskers 
in a shootout, it blitzed the 
Hoosiers while holding them to 
just 60 points.

Four 
of 
the 
five 
players 

in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
starting 

lineup 
average 
double-digit 

scoring totals. Senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. leads the 
way with 15.1, while wing Zak 
Irvin averages 13.2. Both have 
capitalized on the impulse to 
make their final seasons count, 
coming up clutch in crunch time 
on multiple occasions, often from 
the free-throw line.

Redshirt 
sophomore 
DJ 

Wilson and sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner have emerged 
as viable options for Michigan 
inside 
the 
paint. 
Averaging 

13.4 and 12.4 points per game, 
respectively, the pair of big men 
provide an interior presence that 
the Wolverines sorely lacked a 
year ago.

The duo replaced redshirt 

junior guard Duncan Robinson 
and senior forward Mark Donnal 
in the first rotation, but the two 
veterans continue to make their 
presence felt off the bench. 
Junior 
guard 
Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rahkman, the sole 
starter who averages less than 10 
points per game, has struggled to 
duplicate his breakout campaign 
from last year, but still averages 
7.6 points from the ‘2’ spot.

While the offense is far from 

Michigan’s point of weakness, it 
still has room for improvement in 
the second half of the conference 
season.

Defense: D+
In order for the Wolverines 

to turn their Big Ten fortunes 
around, the defense needs a 
serious adjustment. Michigan 
sits dead last in the conference 
in both opponents’ field-goal and 
3-point 
field-goal 
percentage, 

allowing a rate of 51.8 and 48.9 
percent, respectively.

While the Wolverines haven’t 

given up absurdly high point 
totals often — the most scored 
against them was 86, and that 
was in an overtime loss to Iowa 
— their losses have come in 
moments when they are beaten 
on that side of the floor.

In four of its five losses, 

defensive lapses came along 
with poor timing for Michigan. 
Against both Iowa and then-
No. 17 Wisconsin, late defensive 
breakdowns cost the Wolverines 

relatively 
winnable 
games. 

Meanwhile, in the first half 
against Maryland and in the 
second half against Michigan 
State, substantial runs swung 
the momentum in the direction 
of the opposition. Only at Illinois 
did the Wolverines fall apart on 
defense throughout the entire 
game.

Though 
Michigan 
has 

struggled to stop its opponents 
from scoring, its strong suit 
is keeping them from scoring 
second-chance points. Forceful 
on the backboard, the Wolverines 
average 31.4 rebounds per game, 
good for second in the Big Ten. 
Wilson leads that effort with 
an average of 5.6, and Walton 
bolsters him with the next best 
average of 5.1 per game. 

While rebounds seem to 

come naturally on the defensive 
end, Michigan sits in dead last 
in the conference in yet another 
statistic, 
with 
a 
minus-3.7 

rebounding margin because the 
Wolverines average just eight 
offensive rebounds per game.

Without a major improvement 

on the defensive side of the 

ball in the second half of the 
season, Michigan will struggle to 
contend in the Big Ten.

Second half outlook:
Though 
the 
Wolverines 

currently sit under .500, they 
have the potential to finish out 
the conference season on a much 
higher note.

Michigan 
should 
have 

winnable games left against Ohio 
State (3-7), Minnesota (3-6) and 
Rutgers (1-9). It already defeated 
Indiana (5-5) and Nebraska (4-5) 
and has the ability to replicate 
those feats, even though the 
Wolverines will go on the road 
where they have yet to win a 
game this year. They were within 
striking distance of Wisconsin 
(8-1) and Michigan State (5-4) 
in Madison and East Lansing, 
respectively, and playing at home 
in those rematches could provide 
the 
difference. 
That 
leaves 

Northwestern (7-2) and Purdue 
(6-3) as likely losses.

Last season, Michigan started 

strong and then fell apart. This 
season, a reversal could be in 
store.

Predicted record: 11-7

‘M’ hosts second “Signing of the Stars”

While last year’s inaugural 

“Signing of the Stars” was a 
celebrity-laden showcase, the 
2017 edition of the event simply 
featured 
Michigan 
coaches, 

players and alumni.

That 
may 
seem 

underwhelming. 
Yet, 
when 

softball coach Carol Hutchins 
took the stage, the entire crowd 
rose to applaud her. And when 
former wide receivers Braylon 
Edwards and Devin Funchess 
appeared on stage with former 
quarterback Jake Rudock, the 
crowd stood again to cheer.

It 
was 
a 
ceremony 
that 

showcased the Wolverine fan 
base’s support, no matter the 
sport.

“It was just a thought that I 

had — we had — to make it more 
about Michigan,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “From 
the band, the cheerleaders, the 
drumline, 
coaches, 
players, 

parents — make it about the 
family. Make it about the family 
that we are at the University of 
Michigan.”

The 
choice 
may 
have 

also been a reflection of the 
recruiting 
pitch 
Michigan 

gave this year’s recruits. The 
Wolverines secured their best 
recruiting class of all time, and 
for some of the commits, the 
family-feel of the event was 
exactly the reason they came to 
Ann Arbor.

“That feeling of home, that 

feeling of family at Michigan, 
that’s the reason why I’m here 
right 
now,” 
said 
incoming 

freshman 
defensive 
back 

Benjamin St-Juste. “A lot of 
schools were offering me a bunch 
of stuff like Michigan — playing 
time, all that stuff. But like, you 
want to wake up in the morning 
and feel comfortable with where 
you’re at. And Michigan offered 
that. You feel like home, you feel 
like family. That’s what’s great 
about Michigan.”

The feeling of family was 

most evident when Michigan 
invited Larry Prout Jr. to the 
stage at Crisler Center. Prout 
— who was born with spina 
bifida, cloacal exstrophy and 
massive omphalocele among a 
multitude of other illnesses that 
have 
required 

more than 90 
surgeries 
in 

his 
15 
years 

— 
has 
been 

championed by 
the 
Michigan 

football 
program. 
He 

was 
made 

an 
honorary 

member of the 
team in October 
and received a trip to watch the 
team play in the Orange Bowl.

On Wednesday, Prout took the 

stage with his family, danced a 
little bit, held up the block ‘M’ 
gloves he was wearing and used 

the moment to promote C.S. 
Mott Children’s Hospital.

The crowd rose for Prout, 

and once again, a family-like 
atmosphere 
engulfed 
Crisler 

Center.

“It means so much to me,” 

Harbaugh 
said. 

“Never has that 
resonated 
more. 

We 
brought 

home our seventh 
child a day ago. 
… 
There’s 
no 

better word in the 
English language 
to me than family, 
and this is this 
family 
of 
ours: 

the University of 

Michigan.”

Of course, the event still 

retained much of its pomp from 
last year. Between the marching 
band, a University group of 
drummers and the comedy of the 

emcees — Jason and Randy Sklar 
— there was a somewhat raucous 
atmosphere throughout.

At the end of the event, 

Harbaugh took the microphone. 
After all the incoming freshmen 
had 
been 
announced 
and 

discussed, after all the past 
Michigan 
players 
had 
been 

given their proper recognition 
and after the countless standing 
ovations had been given, he 
put an exclamation point on 
the event with his now-famous 
catchphrase.

“Who’s got it better than us?” 

Harbaugh asked.

The 
crowd 
responded 
in 

unison: “Nobody!”

Based on the on-field product 

in past years, it’s a sentiment 
that could be argued. But to 
the players and coaches within 
the Michigan football program, 
after today’s celebration, it’s 
obvious they believe it’s true.

Solomon, Collins choose Michigan on National Signing Day

Tom Brady was in Houston 

preparing for the Super Bowl. 
Migos and Jim Leyland were 
nowhere to be found. And then, 
over an hour before the ceremony 
even started, Michigan’s top 
remaining target picked the 
Wolverines on national television 
and faxed his letter of intent to 
Ann Arbor.

So while this year’s “Signing 

of the Stars” might have had less 
star power and suspense than its 
predecessor, National Signing 
Day — a day that has become like 
a holiday for those who follow 
recruiting — was no less sweet 
for the Michigan football team 
as it closed out its best class since 
recruiting rankings began.

Unlike last year’s class, which 

also ranked among the best in 
the nation, this year’s class came 
together much more smoothly 
for Michigan.

In 
2016, 
the 
Wolverines 

received a flurry of commitments 
in the final few weeks of 
January before sweating out the 
signatures of Rashan Gary, Devin 
Asiasi and Lavert Hill. This 
year, though, Michigan’s class 
was nearly full before National 
Signing Day. But once again, Jim 
Harbaugh 
and 

the rest of the 
coaching 
staff 

waited on pins 
and needles for 
the decisions of 
several recruits.

The 
day 

got 
off 
to 
a 

slow start for 
Michigan. 
In 

the 
span 
of 

fewer than 30 
minutes, two of the remaining 
four targets went off the board 
when Mekhi Becton and Willie 
Gay 
picked 
Louisville 
and 

Mississippi State, respectively.

The 
Wolverines, 
though, 

would close strong. At 10:30, 
Aubrey Solomon pulled out a 
white Michigan hat on ESPN, 
punter Brad Robbins committed 
during the event, and later in the 
afternoon, Nico Collins tweeted 
out a video of his commitment to 
the Wolverines.

Solomon’s final decision ended 

what 
had 
been 

a 
long-winding 

recruitment. 
The 
five-star 

defensive 
tackle 

from 
Leesburg, 

Ga., 
originally 

committed 
to 

Michigan 
during 

an unofficial visit 
in the summer. But 
he 
decommitted 

shortly 
after, 

citing a recruiting letter in 
which his name was misspelled. 
In the world of college football, 
recommitments 
very 
rarely 

occur, and it appeared Solomon 
would end up with a different 

team when he named Alabama as 
his leader in early January.

Yet the Wolverines came out on 

the right side of Solomon’s second 
choice of the process, beating 
out the likes of the Crimson 
Tide, Southern California and 
Georgia. In doing so, they added a 
crucial piece to next year’s team, 
as 
Michigan 

lacks depth on 
the interior of 
the 
defensive 

line, 
and 

perhaps earned 
a 
symbolic 

victory as well. 
Solomon’s high 
school, 
Lee 

County 
High 

School, was the 
site of a satellite 
camp hosted by Harbaugh and 
the coaching staff in June. 
Solomon 
was 
also 
heavily 

pursued by Nick Saban and 
Kirby Smart, two coaches who 
spoke out early and often against 

satellite camps.

“For two years, he’s been one 

of the top guys on the board,” 
said defensive coordinator Don 
Brown on ESPNU. “It will be 
nice to see (Solomon) and Rashan 
(Gary) play next to each other at 
times, so we’re very, very excited 
about it.

“We 
think 

we’ve addressed a 
number of needs, 
but it was a nice 
gift today, that’s 
for sure. … We’re 
excited, 
there’s 

no 
question 
… 

he’s going to be a 
great compliment 
in our four-down 
system.”

Collins was a 

victory for Michigan’s staff in the 
same vein. The 6-foot-5 receiver, 
ranked as a four-star recruit, 
is from Pinson, Ala. and was 
considering Alabama, Georgia 
and Louisiana State in addition 

to the Wolverines. Michigan 
rarely signs recruits from the 
deep south that are wanted by 
teams like the Crimson Tide or 
Bulldogs, yet on Wednesday, 
they got two that rank amongst 
the nation’s best.

Many of Michigan’s mid-year 

enrollees spoke Wednesday about 
recognizing 
the 
opportunity 

they have to play early in their 
careers, especially considering 
the Wolverines graduated most 
of last year’s team that finished 
just short of making the College 
Football Playoff. They will be 
significantly younger next year, 
and there will be growing pains 
along the way as inexperienced 
players find their way onto the 
depth chart. 

But as Brown pointed out 

Wednesday, those inexperienced 
players are talented. And after 
Michigan 
put 
the 
finishing 

touches on its bumper crop 
of a recruiting class, Brown’s 
assertion only rings truer.

EVAN AARON/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh managed to reel in an impressive recruiting class, signing two five-star recruits, 19 four-star recruits and eight three-star recruits.

“It was just a 

thought I had ... 
to make it more 
about family”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

On January 21st, I was one 

in a million — one in more 
than 3 million people who 
marched 
in 
the 
Women’s 

March on Washington and 
its sister marches worldwide. 
There were marches in each 
of the 50 states, including 
thousands of people in Alaska 
who marched through negative 
temperatures and falling snow. 
Crowd scientists estimate the 
marches are the largest protest 
in American history and that 
the crowds in Washington D.C. 
outnumbered those at Trump’s 
inauguration three times over 
— a fact that’s apparently made 
POTUS very upset.

That’s where I was the 

day 
after 
the 
inauguration 

— Washington D.C. I flew 
in on Friday, the day of the 
inauguration. 
Trump 
was 

preparing to be sworn in while 
I was 39,000 feet above the 
country, and became president 
shortly after I touched down in 
Baltimore.

I met my mom there. She’s 

been fighting this sort of fight 
much longer than I have. She’s 
a teacher, and has taught in 
public 
schools 
in 
Chicago 

and Baltimore — schools that 
serve predominantly minority 
students, schools where every 
student 
qualifies 
for 
free 

lunches, 
schools 
with 
the 

lowest reading scores in their 
city. She knows what’s at stake.

We marched with my mom’s 

college roommate (from her 
time at the University) Lori 
and her daughter Kira. None 
of us had participated in this 
sort of protest before, but we all 
felt the weight of the political 
moment too heavily to remain 
silent.

It’s hard to say whose idea it 

was to go. I remember calling 
my mom in the yard of Betsy 
Barber — a place that I felt 
safe for public crying — on the 
morning after the election. I’ll 
never forget how upset I was 
that day, how quiet campus 
was, the way we all looked 
at each other as if to say, “I’m 
sorry.” But when I spoke to her 
she reminded me that it was 
going to be OK. Because we 
were going to fight. And we 

weren’t going to stop fighting 
until it was OK.

I’m so grateful I got to go 

with my mom, the woman 
who raised me to be strong 
and smart and outspoken. The 
person off whom I’ve modeled 
much of myself.

LSA 
sophomore 
Kellie 

Lounds was also one of the 
500,000 people who descended 
on the National Mall that day. 
She drove all the way from 
Ann Arbor to D.C. with a group 
of female students from the 
University.

“I felt like I was going 

to regret it if I didn’t go … 
because I knew it was going to 
be a historic amount of people 
showing up. I had been feeling 
sort of down — especially with 
the inauguration and I knew 
that I needed something to 
jumpstart me.”

As a member of University’s 

chapter of College Democrats 
and chair of the female-interest 
sub-group, FemDems, Kellie 
Lounds knows that activism 
doesn’t end when the march 
does — a concern of many 
activists who were wary of the 
march’s ability to motivate the 
public in the long term.

“I think it’s a good place 

to start. The fact that 500 
(or however many hundred) 
thousand people showed up 
matters because it shows that 
people care. But I don’t think 
it’s the end-all-be-all solution,” 
Lounds said.

That “where do we go from 

here” sentiment was something 
shared among many of the 
women I’ve spoken to before 
and after the March.

For Lounds, the next step 

is to be a better ally for those 
who are affected more acutely 
by Trump’s policies, as well 
as for those who have largely 
been pushed out of mainstream 
activist movements.

“While I was at the March I 

didn’t really think about this at 
all but after we got done I read 
a lot of articles about how a lot 
of signage and messaging wasn’t 
very trans-inclusive,” Lounds 
said, “It made me check myself 
and be like, ‘You showed up and 
that’s good, but you can always 
be a better ally.’”

The March forced a lot of 

people to check their places as 
activists, myself included, and 
woke some people up to the 
necessity of their voices in an 
ongoing fight for justice and 
equality — a response that many 
felt was overdue. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Hannah 

Foster echoed that sentiment, 
calling on her peers to remain 
attentive to issues that might 
not impact them directly.

“More 
than 
anything 
I 

think it’s important to educate 
ourselves about the new policies 
being put in place,” Foster 
said, “to keep ourselves from 
becoming apathetic about the 

injustices happening now — 
which can be hard to do when 
these policies don’t affect you 
personally.”

That’s something I’m guilty 

of, not showing up until my 
rights were at stake. That sort 
of reversal of attitude made 
many 
people 
whose 
rights 

have always been on the line 
feel 
uncomfortable 
about 

the march. Much has been 
written about the division that 
still exists among a group of 

seemingly — if only by location 
— united people. The worry that 
people were only marching for 
themselves seemed to be the 
lingering concern shared among 
many following the March.

To some extent I would say, 

yes, I’m sure many of the people 
who flooded the streets of D.C. 
the day after the inauguration 
would not have been there had 
Trump’s 
promised 
policies 

(which we’re now seeing put 
into place at an alarming speed) 
not affected their lives directly. 
It was the first time at a major 
protest for everyone in my group, 
but I’m sure it won’t be our last. 
As a sign at a #NoBan protest 
suggested, protests are going 
to become a regular activity for 
many who got their first taste at 
the Women’s March.

This delayed response was 

understandably frustrating for 
many whose lives have been 
monumentally shaped by public 
policy long before the Trump 
era. Foster recognizes what’s 
at stake for many people in 
this country under a Trump 
presidency.

“It’s 
hard 
not 
to 
be 

overwhelmed 
by 
the 
sheer 

number of things I feel the need 
to speak out against and I’ve had 
some difficulty figuring out how 
to begin,” Foster said. “It helps 
to stay connected with other 
people who also feel obligated 
to work against some of what is 
happening.”

Because 
in 
addition 
to 

unifying a group of like-minded 
people, the March highlighted 
the divisions that exist even 
within 
liberal, 
progressive 

activism. Divisions along the 
lines of race, sexuality and 
religion were still visible, even 
at an event designed as a unifier.

What the Women’s March 

did is set a precedent for how 
to respond to the inevitable 
injustices of this presidency. 

Since that day protests have 
erupted across the country 
in response to the green-
lighting of the Dakota Access 
and Keystone Pipelines and, 
most recently, to Trump’s ban 
on immigration from seven 
Muslim-majority 
countries. 

The 
Women’s 
March 
was 

the first, and many feared it 
would be the last. And while 
the subsequent protests haven’t 
brought out the same numbers, 
their size relative to their 
spontaneity seems to be owed — 
in a small part at least — to the 
example of activism set by the 
Women’s March.

“Being in D.C. with hundreds 

of thousands of other people 
who shared my concerns was 
absolutely 
surreal,” 
Foster 

said of the lasting power of the 
march. “I left empowered and 
energized when before I felt 
scared and helpless. I’ll never 
forget it.”

For 
LSA 
sophomore 
Ana 

Patchin, she felt that her hope 
for the country — which had 
dampened since the election — 
was energized at the March.

“I 
was 
standing 
outside 

the Smithsonian Museum of 
American History, and I watched 
as a crowd of people carried a 
copy of the Constitution that 
they had crafted out of burlap 
down 
Constitution 
Avenue,” 

Patchin recalled. “That image 
has stuck with me. It serves as a 
reminder to me of how each and 
every day the people have the 
opportunity to carry the values 
that we believe in.”

Patchin described how hard it 

had been for her to believe in the 
goodness of America after the 
election — a feeling I, and many 
others, shared. She described a 
feeling of pride in the country 
on that morning and a great 
hope for its future as she joined 
the crowds on the mall.

“Every day I am finding 

so 
many 
reasons 
to 
feel 

disheartened,” 
Patchin 
said. 

“However, the march, and the 
action that people all across the 
U.S. have taken as a result, gives 
me a great deal of hope.”

While the Women’s March 

on Washington set a precedent 
for national activism, the same 
happened on a local level as 
thousands marched right here 
in Ann Arbor, in a sister march 
organized by Progressives at 
the University of Michigan and 
Michigan to Believe In.

“It all happened so fast,” 

said Public Policy junior Claire 
Cepuran, who organized the 
march with LSA sophomore 
Brad 
McPherson 
and 
LSA 

sophomore Robert Joseph. They 
didn’t know they were marching 
until 
early 
January, 
when 

Michigan to Believe In reached 
out to them about co-sponsoring 
the event. 

“Following the election there 

were a lot of people feeling 
upset and like they wanted to do 

something and get involved and 
show their solidarity somehow, 
but they didn’t really know how 
and this seemed like a really 
good outlet for that,” Cepuran 
said.

She felt a deep connection to 

the March and what it stood for, 
and was motivated to march for 
many of the same reasons other 
women were.

“Gender issues have always 

been really important to me … 
that’s why the women’s march 
was so cool and was so close 
to my heart,” Cepuran said. 
“I’ve always sort of felt that 
inequality.”

Cepuran, 
McPherson 
and 

Joseph 
run 
Progressives 
at 

the University of Michigan, a 
student organization started at 

the end of last semester with the 
goal of getting more progressive 
candidates into office on the 
city, county and state levels.

“I think there are a lot of 

progressive 
people, 
young 

people 
especially, 
who 
are 

not feeling represented by the 
Democratic 
Party,” 
Cepuran 

said. “We’re hoping to flood 
them with all of these young 
passionate people who want 
change.”

The meeting I attended last 

week attracted students as well 
as many Ann Arbor residents 
who feel passionately about 
similar causes. Everyone was 
eager to help in any way they 
could. For activists of all ages, 
the big question is still: What 
can I do next?

“There are two parts to 

making real change: You have to 
have the activism that focuses 
on expressing that there is a 
problem and then you have to 
focus on actual legislation and 
pushing for more parity between 
genders in government or in, 
say, the presidential cabinet,” 
McPherson said.

So now we’re on part two. 

The 
problems 
have 
been 

exposed, and are continuing to 
be exposed every day. We know 

what’s wrong. But it’s going to be 
hard to maintain the same level 
of energy that was achieved on 
January 21st.

I know I’m never going to 

forget how it felt when I got off 
the train at Judiciary Square 
and saw people lined up all 
the way down both sides of the 
platform. Or how it felt to hear 
someone in our car start singing 
“This Land is Your Land.”

But what I’m really never 

going to forget is how it felt on 
November 8th, watching the 
results come in as I sat in my 
friend’s apartment — the weight 
of the grief. And I’m never going 
to forget my dad calling me last 
Sunday to tell me how upset he 
was that his country, as a nation 
of 
immigrants, 
could 
turn 

against refugees looking for 
safety in a country that prided 
itself on its inclusivity.

I’m never going to forget 

how different it feels scrolling 
through 
my 
Twitter 
feed 

tonight, seeing piece after piece 
of my country fall apart and how 
it felt to stand on the top on the 
risers across from the National 
Archives and see people from 
the White House to the Capitol 
who believe, like I do, that 
America is better than a racist 
in an ill-fitting suit.

I’m lucky to have gotten to 

march with my mom. To have 
been able to fight alongside 
someone I know will never stop 
fighting for me. I’m so lucky 
to have been raised by people 
who set such a strong example 
of what it looks like to love and 
fight — and to forgive.

But I can’t just be lucky 

anymore. It’s time to make 
action out of the values I was 
raised with. Because it’s not just 
about surviving until midterms 
anymore. The March made it 
clear to me that this is much 
more urgent than I would have 
ever previously allowed myself 
believe.

At the end of the day it’s (sort 

of) simple: An international 
disease of hatred has produced 
a regime determined to turn an 
already divided nation against 
itself. It’s infuriating, but the 
best thing we can do is to stay 
angry, and to find in the midst 
of that anger some love for one 
another.

The 
Women’s 
March 
on 

Washington wasn’t perfect and 
it wasn’t the end, but what it did 
do was light a fire in the hearts 
of people of all ages and remind 
us that America is still worth 
fighting for.

The Women’s March: What we

None of us had 
participated in 

this sort of protest

That’s something

Thursday, February 2, 2017 — 3B

I had no idea what I was in 

for upon reaching the prominent 
pillared, 
white 
house 
on 

Tappan, but after talking to 
Art & Design seniors Madisen 
Bathish and Francesca Kielb, 
I was happy to learn about the 
exciting yet relatively secret 
new brand they’d created. After 
only a few minutes of sitting in 
their kitchen and talking about 
fashion, their latest project and 
their hopes for the future, it was 
clear they had done something 
extraordinary with an inspiring 
purpose.

As two extremely talented Art 

& Design students, the prospect 
of graduating college with only 
an Art & Design major poses 
both incredible opportunity and, 
all-too-real, vulnerability. As 
members of the next generation 
of young artists, Bathish and 
Kielb possess exciting potential 
with 
their 
brilliant 
work, 

impressive résumés and bold 
femininity. Kielb was a former 
Managing 
Design 
Editor 
of 

the Daily. However, becoming 
a female entrepreneur with a 
major in Art & Design presents 
a daunting amount of pressure 
to overcome in the next four 
years. 
Even 
as 
progressive 

strides are made in regard 
to unbalanced aspects of the 
world, like the gender wage gap, 
women still face disadvantage, 
a dynamic brought to light 
constantly in the wake of the 
recent election. Graduating as an 

Art & Design student presents 
its own challenges, including 
a known lack of employment 
opportunities many majors are 
said to ensure. 

In 
an 
effort 
to 
reduce 

federal spending, the Trump 
administration plans to defund 
the 
National 
Endowment 

for the Arts, which provides 
essential funding in grants to 
the exhibition and cultivation of 
the arts. Despite taking up less 
than .003 percent of the nation’s 
yearly 
budget, 
cuts 
would 

have a drastic effect on the 

artistic community nationwide, 
especially for upcoming artists 
such as Bathish, who is hoping to 
pursue fashion merchandising, 
and Kielb, who is pursuing 
curation after graduation. Faced 
with this pressure and a passion 
to support like-minded women 
in the arts, the two came up 
with a trend-setting idea to 
take thrown-away clothing and 
transform it into something more 
fabulous. Their brand is called 
OVRKLL, and its resurrection 
of forgotten clothing makes 
an exclusive, sought-after look 
possible for any maximalist-
conscious woman.

Over Winter Break, Kielb 

approached Bathish, remarking 
on the girls’ uncanny ability to 
sort through racks and piles 
of 
old, 
unwanted 
clothing. 

They realized they both loved 
the vintage look best found at 
thrift stores, and realized their 
ability to find the hidden gems 
could help others find the same 
exciting look every girl wants, 
but decides she doesn’t have the 
time, money or effort for.

After 
rooting 
through 

Salvation Army racks on any 
given 
day, 
the 
two 
would 

pool their findings: a tank 
from Dior, vintage tees, brand 
name jeans, a silk robe and 
faux fur accessories. Mostly 
designer, all chic and obviously 
opulent. Their hunts yielded 
a surprising amount of brand-
name merchandise with the 
potential to form an iconic look. 
With an eye for potential and 
detail, the pair repurposed their 
findings with embellishments 
and alterations. The two showed 
me some of the latest treasures 
from their collection. Holding 
up their latest treasures, Bathish 
donned a pink bomber jacket, 
sporting a lip patch she’d crafted 
herself, while Kielb pulled out 
a black satin robe, complete 
with an Alexander McQueen 
label. While Bathish works with 
more of a fashion background, 
interested in the design and 
creation of clothing, Kielb is 
especially 
interested 
in 
the 

curative, 
marketing 
process. 

Kielb put it jokingly: “We both 
want to do what the other 
doesn’t” — making them the 
perfect team for the continuation 
of the brand.

When describing their own 

style and the look of OVRKLL, 
the two used one word over 
and over again: maximalism. 
It’s 
most 
easily 
described 

as an aesthetic rejection of 
minimalism, a difficult concept 
to execute in the world of art 
and fashion. For them, however, 

the idea is simple. Maximalism, 
as Bathish said, consists of 
“things you wouldn’t usually 
put together being put together 
to look fucking epic.” Seen in 
collections by the likes of Gucci 
and Prada, maximalist clothing 
is 
elaborate 
and 
luxurious, 

but 
lacking 
responsibility 

and 
accessibility. 
OVRKLL 

intends to take on a perspective 
that challenges the value we 
hold in our clothing, proving 

maximalism is possible without 
the price tag and excessive use 
of new materials. As they put it, 
“Through our own vision, we 
make something fabulous out of 
recycled means.”

Better yet, OVRKLL is part 

of a collaborative effort that 
goes beyond its own magnificent 
clothing 
and 
accessories. 

Kielb and Bathish have also 
created a pop-up shop for 
“women makers,” in which to 
sell OVRKLL the creations of 
numerous other female artists 
in the School of Art & Design. 
Other artists and designers can 
sell their works and take home 
full profit with no cuts required 
for a place in the pop-up shop. 
The overarching hope is for the 
effort to take on a life of its own 
with more and more student 
artists taking part over time.

The first pop-up shop is 

scheduled for Feb. 4 at Amer’s 
on Church Street. The two hope 
to transform the back of the deli 
into a fresh venue complete with 
drapes, screens, decorations and 
clothing racks for a boutique-y 
vibe. However, supporting the 
space for themselves and other 
artists costs money — more than 
one would think — which has 
encouraged the two to apply 
for an ADC Grant from the 
Art & Design School. They 
hope the space can grow into 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 

female entrepreneurs. Their 
newest collection can be seen 
on Facebook and Instagram at 
@SHOPOVRKLL.

SARAH AGNONE

Daily Arts Writer

Emily Malan — a freelance 

photographer 
whose 
client 

list stretches from Vogue to 
Airbnb — believes her work is 
“more interesting than just a 
pretty girl and a pretty street.”

Malan’s 
grandparents 

were the first Chinese family 
to settle in Cupertino, the 
northern 
California 
city 

that now hosts Apple Inc.’s 
headquarters.

“My grandparents owned 

a flower farm so there were 
chrysanthemums and a flower 
stand that they sold them 
at — that whole area was 
just orchards” Malan said. 
A few generations later, the 
demographics 
shifted, 
the 

photographer’s high school 
was “70 percent Asian and 30 
percent white.”

Raised 
in 
a 
creative 

household, Malan first picked 
up 
her 
mulit-media 
artist 

mother’s camera at the age of 
12.

“Having a family with an 

artistic 
background 
is 
an 

advantage,” she said, but her 
mother warned she’d “rather 
have me not be an artist 
because she knows how hard 
it is.”

Malan looked challenge in 

the eye, though, enrolling in 
photography classes at a local 
community college as a high-
schooler to “get a level up” in 
the field.

She went on to earn her BFA 

in photography from the Art 
Center College of Design in 
Pasadena, Calif. in 2010.

“I definitely didn’t have a 

lot of work when I was first 
starting out” she said. But 
after spending five years in LA 
after graduation building her 
professional network, Emily 
Malan is in demand. This 
season, her travel schedule 
buzzes with jobs in New York, 
Paris, 
Hong 
Kong, 
Tokyo 

and Southern California for 
the Coachella music festival. 
When I spoke to her, she had 

just returned from Couture 
Week in Paris — before that, 
she attended Men’s Week in 
Milan.

“You kind of turn into a 

local,” 
Malan 
continued, 

“immersed in culture, meeting 
people — you’re on your own 
most of the time.” 

Over years of traveling, 

the photographer has grown 
comfortable with the “idea 
of being a city-dweller.” This 
notion shines through in her 
work; some of Malan’s most 
striking and vibrant photos 
are her “street style” shots. 
“I’m 
really 
influenced 
by 

cities,” she said, noting how 
some photographers “use the 
street as a background and the 
cool person wearing the cool 
clothing but there’s no story 
being told with it — I’m more 
interested in telling a kind-of 
narrative.”

At November’s Pitti Uomo 

men’s trade show in Florence, 
Malan was hired by Barney’s 
to shoot behind the scenes 
of the Tim Coppens runway 
show.

“They wanted to tell a story 

with it, the runway, the getting 
ready, the makeup and the 
hair,” she explained. “I was 
like: ‘okay I can do this pretty 
easy, pretty straightforward.’”

But 
once 
she 
arrived 

backstage, 
Malan 
couldn’t 

help but zoom in on the set’s 
solely-male 
atmosphere. 
“I 

was the only girl photographer 
backstage — literally the only 
one.” She recalled thinking, 

“‘Why am I the only girl here? 
What’s going on?’”

As a female who frequently 

finds herself in a crowd of 
male-dominated 
lenses, 

Malan’s gender has acted as the 
impetus for the minimization 
of her talent, work ethic and 
professionalism.

“One 
of 
the 
guys 
that 

shoots for GQ and Vogue, he 
definitely does not like girls 
around, backstage he would 
walk into my shots,” she said 
of her experience in Florence. 
Yet 
she 
mentioned 
that 

another male colleague put his 
opinion bluntly: “Girls should 
have a place in the field.”

“People have tried to take 

advantage of me because they 
think I’m just some girl,” Malan 
recounted. 
Undoubtedly, 

though, the photographer has 
earned her prominence as a 
strategic player behind the 
runway and in city streets. 
She’s professional, poised and 
confident in her capabilities, 
but 
despite 
her 
success, 

Malan remains eager to push 
her potential and refine her 
artistic eye. “Creativity is 
inherent but also you need 
to learn it by looking” she 
noted. “I try to always say 
yes to experiences, you never 
know what’s going to happen 
— small things do lead to good 
things.”

The 
good 
things 
keep 

coming for Malan: In just 
a 
week, 
the 
photographer 

will be heading to New York 
Fashion Week, and at the end 
of the month, she’ll shoot Paris 
Fashion Week. Even so, the 
artist’s impressive schedule 
doesn’t quench her thirst to 
look and learn. “I’m curious to 
know what else is out there,” 
she remarked. Malan accented 
the value of this curiosity in 
aspiring young artists — as 
well as the virtues of hard 
work and self worth.

“Don’t think that in order to 

get where you want to be that 
you need to sleep with a man,” 
she said, “and make sure you 
get your money.”

Despite being rela-

tively small and new, Flyte 
have consistently brought 
out some of the most out-
standing singles and EPs 
of the last few years. Now 
building to their debut 
album, “Echoes,” a single 
released on Monday, marks 
their first release since 
“Please Eloise” in 2015.
 
Finding inspira-

tion in nostalgia, both 
lyrically and musically, 
“Echoes” is an ethereal 
walk through bittersweet 
lyrics and punchy synths. 
Although the song just 
about reaches the three-
minute mark, there is 

emotion packed into every 
second, and the hum-
ming bass and synths take 
centre stage. That is in no 
way to say that this isn’t 

just as captivating lyri-
cally, though. Tackling the 
hard truths of forgetting 
and reminiscence, singer 
Will Taylor evokes relat-
able post-break up emo-
tions through the repeated 
refrain, “they remember 

the echoes.” Another tal-
ent that Flyte have honed 
so well is harmonizing, 
perhaps exemplified on a 
cappella videos posted on 
Facebook recently, but here 
it plays a subdued part. It 
suits the sound perfectly.
 
“Echoes” is a true 

short, but sweet song — so 
nostalgic, yet it only toes 
the line of sadness. Flyte 
are experts at emotional 
writing, and their first 
single in two years shows 
that this talent is not going 
anywhere.

Who let Sober Christian™ into this party? Oh wait. It’s 

his apartment. Doors lead to trap doors. Juxtaposition of the 

cornfield and the sleek black hoodie with zipper accents — 

never noticed before. Woman out here literally walking 

through water in a Roberto Cavalli gown. Is the baseball 

bat also designer? Bang bang! Mood: Calling yourself 

the “baddest woman in the game.” Beyoncé driving 
over every parked car in a monster truck is my 
mom when she comes to visit Ann Arbor. Beyoncé 
yelling is so hot. Only person who can make the 
word ‘pussy’ sound eloquent. Waiting in thorough 
anticipation of Serena Williams’ scene. Bang 
bang!!! She here! “If I saw Serena and Beyoncé 
next to each other I’d be equally in awe of both of 
them.” “She too smart to crave material things,” 
but they don’t hurt, am I right, custom Cavalli 
gown? Now I am borderline crying because police 
brutality has taken so many. The mother who hastily 

shakes her head no as she holds up a picture of her 

murdered son. America is not fair. Beyoncé is speaking 

to the metaphor of lemonade and the room is quiet. “Every 

single costume in ‘Formation’ needs to be in a museum.” YES 

CHRISTIAN.

‘Lemonade’ ft. Twins

in this series, three daily arts writers in varying states 

of mind do the same activity and write about it.

this week’s event:

My god this cinemotography. 
“Prayin to catch me”
“Where do you go when you go quiet” holy shit I’m already dead and this started 2 minutes ago.

She’s hitting me with her 

fuck I forgot what I was gonna say. This demon in my mind just asked if this video was over-

rated. God damn.

Oh I remember! DudeShe’s hitting me with poetry !! Pure poetry!!

Beyoncé almost plummeted to her death my heart just fell from my body.

My jaw just dropped all this water came rushing out of this building 

during “hold up” it’s a Beyoncé tsunami!! Slant rhyme!

I truly believe Beyoncé has the power of life and death.

I can’t wait until Blue Ivy is old enough to watch 

this god damn will she be proud. B is the leader 

of this female mob and wow I have no idea 
where we are or what we are doing but I 

most genuinely feel like I have been initiated 

into the mob.

Wait do we know how Jay-Z feels about this album?? 

does he finally feel bad for what he did? Or like ?

Anger to apathy ahhhhhh Is that SERENA WILLIAMS ?? they 

look like they are in the same house as AHS Coven setting.

 “Daddy’s Lessons” love this song but the host of this apartment does not. 

Whoa the cup I’m drinking out of has lemons on it like how fucking conve-

nient.

Ok well now we are disrespecting B by talking get about Eminem. Ugh “sand castles” I 

feel tears coming on but my cotton mouth is too bad it’s drying up my tears. Wow props to Jay Z 

for being in this video and knowing that he is a DAMN CHEATER. IN THE PUBLIC EYE.

I’m dead on “Freedom.” I think this is it here I go catch me now

Wait pd (post death) the evolution of her hairrrr though

— Daily Arts Writer

“I tried to make a home out of you but doors lead to trap doors” 

MY HEART. These words hurt enough when they’re not spoken 
by the soft voice of Beyoncé. Baked is giggling at her laughter at 
her own tears. I’m just waiting for “hold up” to come on so I can 
break it the fuck down. It’s on, Someone get me a bat. I hope if 
I ever go on a rampage my breasts look 1/15 as good as beys do 
here. Why does the cinematography in this sometimes remind 
me of Harry Potter, avadaka kadavra jay z. The outfit in “don’t 
hurt yourself” is everything I want to be in this life. (Minus the 
real fur, sorry bey, #meatismurder #morrissey) LOVE GOD 
HERSELF. “If Beyoncé doesn’t have suck his balls neither do I,” 
bored, quote of the century. This album makes me want someone 
to cheat on me. Baked doesn’t have a venmo. Is she Amish? A 
fourth party just reminded me about the fact that Eminem is “the 
skid mark on the underwear of America.” True. Beyoncé and I 
have the same Nina Simone record. I can die now, I am Beyoncé 
always. If you can listen to “Forward” without shedding a tear 
you are truly heartless. Goosebumps. I’m so emo. “Formation” is 
one of the most important things to come out of the last decade. 
Fight me. Replenish my wine.

“If we don’t educate half 

the world, we can’t work as 
efficiently and as advanced as 
we would like to,” said LSA 
sophomore 
Luna 
Terauchi, 

Membership Coordinator of 
She’s the First, when speaking 
about women around the world 
who do not receive education.

As powerful as these words 

are, they do not even slightly 
sum up all the objectives “She’s 
the First” has for the future.

A non-profit organization, 

She’s the First, sponsors girls 
in low-GDP countries that 
allows the girls to graduate 
primary 
and 
secondary 

schools. 
Globally 
founded 

in 2009 and with a chapter 
opening up at University of 
Michigan in 2012, STF has 
been creating opportunities for 
young women all around the 
world who have the potential, 
but do not have the educational 
resources.

“The 
organization 

fundraises and has social 
awareness events that provide 
information about what we are 
raising money for and why,” 
said LSA junior and STF’s 
President, Heidi Haas.

The group has partner 

organizations in other third-
world countries where they 
can easily find and help girls 
who belong in STF.

“There is so much potential 

that 
goes 
untacked 
when 

you have all these girls who 
could contribute something 
really meaningful to society,” 
said 
LSA 
sophomore 
and 

Global Awareness Program 
Representative, Ishani Mathur. 

However, She’s the First 

represents more than just 
women in foreign countries 
who are in need of education. 
They are a standing emblem 
in the area of global female 
oppression — a loud voice 
that can be heard in this sea 
of unjustified women’s rights. 

Although the majority of their 
organization involves women, 
they are eager to recruit more 
men into the group.

“We are trying to get guys 

involved,” 
Terachi 
added, 

“because 
girls 
education 

affects 
everyone, 
not 
just 

women.” With that goal in 
mind, about 10 percent of the 
club’s members are now male.

LSA 
senior 
and 
STF’s 

Events 
Coordinator, 
Mona 

Iskandarani, 
shared 
a 

personal anecdote of how her 
grandmother, a child of 12, was 
not sent to school because she 
was a girl (they educated the 
boys instead). “It’s stripping 
a fundamental right away 

from people because of their 
gender,” she said. “We (STF) 
are thinking about all the 
injustice in the world.”

The 
organization 
is 

consistently going after these 
problems both on a global and 
national scale. Last summer, 
Haas and Terachi attended a 
leadership summit in New York 
City where they interacted 
with 
larger 
corporations 

which support She’s the First. 
What was most humbling for 
the team was when they met 
two girls who were sponsored 
in the organization. It was 
a moment that “brought the 
cause to life,” Haas said. 

Even with so many women 

in such faraway places, the 
board felt as though they, 
too, grow up with the girls by 
staying connected through the 
journey. The club exchanges 
letters with the scholars and 
are able to see the impact that 

is being made on both the girls 
and on the club.

Additionally, 
the 
group 

doesn’t shy away from other 
issues. 
They 
are 
always 

considering the health and 
well-being of the girls and 
their families, their day-to-day 
lives and unfortunately, the 
discomfort and fear society 
creates around being female. 
The board understands that 
talking about these issues with 
these girls is a way to handle 
them.

At a place like the University 

of Michigan, where different 
perspectives 
economically 

and racially create a heavy 
influence, the members of STF 
take these viewpoints into 
consideration.

“We (STF) are about equality 

and education. Education is the 
main thing that is separating us 
from these girls. Other than 
different cultures, there is 
nothing physically or mentally 
different, but education is what 
is giving people power. And 
these girls deserve to have 
equal power,” said Business 
sophomore and Vice President, 
Emily Fletcher.

And as Haas reflected on 

what being a woman meant to 
her, she concluded: “I always 
remember that there are more 
difference within each sex than 
there are between sexes. We 
are living in a very progressive 
time, but not everything will 
fall into place right away. 
Although there a lot of women’s 
issues that need to be solved, I 
am really excited because this 
is the first time women’s issue 
are being valued.”

She’s the First is more than 

a group of people supporting 
educational rights. They will 
continue to make great strides 
in creating equality for all people 
universally and inspiring others 
in the Ann Arbor community 
and beyond. For membership

ALEXANDER WANG

Will womenswear 
remain a man’s world?

Ghesquière, 
Tisci, 

Saab, 
Michele. 
Galliano, 

Lagerfeld, Gvasalia, Wang.

Question: What do these 

things all have in common? 
Each of these men sit at 
the helm of a top-grossing 
women’s 
clothing 
label. 

Even the musical reference 
I just made can be attributed 
to a man.

In 2016, only three of the 

world’s top 12 richest fashion 
brands 
boasted 
female 

creative directors. This is 
especially remarkable given 
that womenswear rakes in 
over $200 billion more of 
the industry’s income than 
men’s. Business of Fashion 
notes that although women 
account for the majority of 
those entering the industry, 
they represented only 40.2 
percent of the 371 designers 
surveyed last fashion month. 
Even 
if 
certain 
fashion 

houses were created by 
women at their time, they 
write, today they often have 
creative leaders that are 
men.

Somewhere 
in 
the 

women’s clothing industry 
lies an alarming disconnect.

Women 
may 
be 

underrepresented 
and 

underpaid in most other 
fields, 
but 
one 
would 

think that they could take 
internal control of the one 
that is, quite literally, made 
for them. Yet something 
continues to keep girl power 
from coming out on top.

Are the meninists right? 

Does 
testosterone 
truly 

know estrogen better than 
estrogen 
knows 
itself? 

After 18 years of immersive 
research on female life, I can 
conclude that the answer is 
no.

To tell you the truth, I 

don’t know what’s driving 
the male domination of 
this 
seemingly 
womanly 

territory. All I know for 

certain is what is true of 
every industry: the existence 
of nuanced inequities among 
men and their qualified 
female 
counterparts. 

That, coupled with brand-
owner groups like Kering 
and LVMH being male-
dominated, could be enough 
to restrain even the most 
talented 
young 
female 

designer.

I can’t write this article 

without 
acknowledging 

the handful of of incredible 
female designers that do 
exist. 
They’re 
scattered 

across the globe, from Milan 
to Tokyo to New York City, 
presenting young women 
in fashion with a silver 
lining 
surrounding 
the 

monogamous cloud that has 
loomed over womenswear 
from the beginning of time.

“Monster,” 
the 
song 

I 
referenced 
earlier, 
is 

comprised of three verses. 
Rick Ross and Jay-Z present 
the first two, accompanied 
by Kanye West in the chorus. 

Things change in the final 
verse: Nicki Minaj, one of 
few 
well-known 
women 

in 
the 
male-dominated 

rap world, takes over. She 
shows listeners who’s boss, 
dropping bars that must 
have left Rick, Jay and ‘Ye 
with their jaws to the floor.

McCartney, 
Karan, 

Prada, Philo. Kawakubo, 
Versace, Sui, Ferretti.

Not unlike Minaj, these 

female designers embody 
all that a woman in fashion 
should. Their poise and 
creativity produces billions 
of dollars in revenue for 
their labels each year –– the 
true embodiment of “think 
big, get cash, make ‘em blink 
fast.” 
They 
consistently 

leave the industry eager for 
what the future will hold, 
inspiring 
their 
up-and-

coming counterparts along 
the way.

Beneath 
the 
surface 

of 
womenswear 
lies 
a 

whole new generation of 
motherf*cking monsters.

The irony in an industry made for women dominated by men


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
the b-side
 
 
 
 
 Thursday, February 2, 2017 — 5B

Our problem is that we really 

don’t listen to one another.

We are in stuck in a period 

of tension, conflicting views, 
fear, confusion — a product of 
merging different perspectives 
and different struggles, all while 
trying to find some common 
ground. Yet, so often we choose 
not to listen. It is not only in the 
form of ignoring the collective 
plea surrounding the major 
problems facing our world, but 
it is that most of us are aware 
of the weight of those topics. 
This inability to listen emerges 
in our everyday interactions 
with one another. That is, not 
solely in the topics evoking high 
levels of sensitivity that are 
covered on the news, but almost 
anything that could possible 
cause a differing of opinion.

A conversation that begins 

something like this:

“I love the winter so much, 

the snow is beautiful,” says the 
girl sitting next to me in lecture, 
while she looks out the window.

I’ve 
instantly 
stopped 

listening. I don’t agree. I hate 
the winter with all my heart 
and constantly ask myself how 

I’ve survived living in Michigan 
my entire life. Her opinion has 
not only provoked me to want 
to express my own, but also, 
has encouraged me to ignore 
whatever she has said about 
the “beauty” of the snow. I’m 
aware she’s speaking about why 
she loves the winter, but I have 
drowned the sound of her voice 
with the booming sound of my 
own thoughts about just how 
wrong I think she is.

I have purposely chosen quite 

a superficial example, not for 
the sake of belittling my point, 
but instead to display that our 
tendencies to avoid listening 
to one another transfer into all 
facets of life, whether important 
or not.

We listen for maybe a few 

words in, but the minute we 
hear something that sounds 
just a little off from what we 
think, we rarely keep listening. 
This happens all the time. The 
professor raises a question, 
hands go up in response and 
someone takes it upon himself 
or herself to share something 
that opposes the thoughts I 
have.Our inability to listen has 

actually become the reason as 
to why conflicting views cannot 
be bridged in some way and 
why we’ve left very little room 
for compromise within our 
community. Our instinct is to 
say: “I have found the fault” or 
“I don’t agree.” The girl sitting 
next to me loves the winter and 
I hate it, so we cannot go on to 
speak about things 
in 
the 
same 
way. 

Because 
we 
don’t 

think the same way.

Well, we’re going 

to spend our entire 
lives trying to find 
people who do.

If 
my 
mind 

could 
stay 
in 
the 

conversation just a 
bit longer to listen, 
I might realize that 
the girl who loves the winter 
might have a memory attached 
to this season or maybe has 
never experienced snow before 
college or maybe doesn’t easily 
feel cold, like I do all months of 
the year.

Don’t get me wrong, the 

problem is not that we have 
different 
opinions 
from 

one another. That’s entirely 
inevitable, and if you’re just 
realizing that now, maybe you 
need to become more observant 
of the way the world functions. 
If 
differing 
opinions 
won’t 

change in our lifetimes, what 
will is our response to them.

Ingrained in me is a habit of 

shutting out others’ thoughts 

simply 
because 
I 

want to respond with 
an 
objection 
that 

reflects my personal 
opinion, convincing 
everyone that I am, 
in fact, right.

My parents have 

always 
told 
me: 

“Bailey, 
you 
have 

to 
start 
listening 

to 
people 
around 

you. You will miss 

so much if you don’t.” For 
the amount of time I spend 
defending myself in opposition 
to 
a 
point 
someone 
raises 

against me, I could spend the 
time listening to what someone 
had said. If I let the girl who 
loves winter tell me why, I could 
have waited to explain to her 
why I hate it.

Mutual 
understanding 
— 

it’s something rare I think 
we’ve lost. Instead of trying to 
consider what position people 
may be coming from, I am so 
fixated on my own. That doesn’t 
mean someone’s opinion has to 
sway you to the “other” side. 
It is more a way of developing 
confirmation 
toward 
why 

you have come to your own 
conclusion, while also making 
an effort to meet the other 
person halfway.

Winter is the worst season 

according to me and maybe 
many others. I could probably 
find and present research on 
the multitude of health benefits 
attached to other seasons or 
attack the amount of illnesses 
that circulate in the winter 
compared to other times of year. 
There are various ways to prove 
a point is correct, but that’s not 
my objective.

It’s the process of getting 

there that matters. I always tell 
people: “We all only listen to 
what we want to hear.”

Justice 
Sonia 
Sotomayor 

spoke at Hill Auditorium this 
past Monday and she shared 

that during her first year as 
an undergraduate student at 
Princeton, she listened. She 
met many people, with many 
backgrounds that were entirely 
different than her own. And 
she listened. Beyond just being 
attentive, she really heard them. 
Today, she is so influential in 
the public sphere and can use 
her voice to project her beliefs 
to the public. She took the time 
early on to listen in order to 
develop a voice that projects 
such value and wisdom.

If we just spent a little more 

time listening to people and 
truly hearing what they have to 
say, our responses to divergent 
views would probably be more 
appropriate. If you really want 
to find a platform for your voice 
to be heard, you must first listen 
to others around you. We live in 
a world of opinionated people, 
who are passionate about many 
things. In order to express your 
view, especially if you’re trying 
to say it is “right,” you have to 
hear what the other side says. 
Otherwise, how do you really 
know they are wrong?

A long, long time ago – in 2012 

– Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) 
was “handling” D.C.’s scandals 
in a white power suit, rigging a 
presidential election and having 
a secret, steamy affair with the 
President of the United States. 
Normal “Scandal” things. 2017, 
however, has proven to be no 
time for normal. With explosions, 
a murder (gasp!) and political 
inconsistencies galore, the sixth 
season premiere of the Shondaland 
drama 
returned 
without 
any 

intention 
of 
reining 
in 
the 

ridiculousness. 

“Scandal” made no attempt 

to hide its political leanings last 
season, as a parody of Donald 
Trump emerged in the form of 
sleazy oil-tycoon Hollis Doyle 
(Gregg Henry, “Gilmore Girls”). 
The stabs were anything but 
subtle, as the fictionalized nominee 
hopeful portrayed all-too-familiar 
characteristics of unsubstantiated 
candidness, 
an 
affinity 
for 

corruption and an unfortunate 
hair-do. Furthermore, the episode 
where fake-Trump is booted out 
of the running for the Republican 
nomination by ex-First Lady and 
senator Mellie Grant (Bellamy 
Young, “The Freebie”) is called 
“Trump Card,” just in case there 
was any ambiguity.

This agenda comes as no 

surprise. Creator Shonda Rhimes, 
along with her three TGIT leading 
ladies Kerry Washington, Viola 
Davis (“How To Get Away With 
Murder”) 
and 
Ellen 
Pompeo 

(“Grey’s Anatomy”), released a 
powerful endorsement for Hillary 
Clinton in the spring of 2016. But 
the “Scandal” cast claims to be 
leaving real-world politics behind 

as the sixth season promises to 
carry a different tune. With the first 
five episodes of the season filmed 
before the November elections, the 
narrative will be a counterpoint, 
rather than a parallel, to the 
current political outcome, Rhimes 
told the Hollywood Reporter.

Perhaps it’s better this way, 

for politics was never “Scandal” 
‘s 
strong 
suit. 
Instead, 
the 

series turns its focus to telling a 
compelling story and churning 
out some goddam entertaining 
drama. Season six opens in the 
final moments of the presidential 
election between Mellie Grant 

and the Democratic nominee 
Frankie Vargas (Ricardo Chavira, 
“Desperate Housewives”). The 
deciding state of the race – of all 
places – comes down to California.

Irritating political paradoxes 

aside, Rhimes is a master of 
building 
compelling 
female 

protagonists. Only a handful of 
shows in recent memory have 
been able to pull off a character 
arc as drastic and fulfilling as the 
one portrayed in Mellie Grant. 
The once-detestable, scorned First 
Lady bitterly standing in the way 
of Olivia and Fitz’s star-crossed 
love affair has gradually – and 
surprisingly – transformed into 
the most relatable character on the 
show. Earlier seasons chipped away 
at the ice queen with trauma: a tub 
of fried chicken and moonshine 
in hand, Mellie’s narrative as a 
mother mourning the loss of her 

son was heartbreaking and, for 
once, completely believable.

But, 
ultimately, 
building 

complexity through pity is not the 
Shondaland style. Rather, strong 
women are formed when they rise 
in spite of adversity, and Mellie is 
the ultimate badass. Facing the 
setbacks that come with being a 
woman in politics to dumping the 
POTUS for her own shot at the 
oval office is ballsy, to say the least. 
She’s strong, flawed and wildly 
interesting. In a landmark fifth-
season episode, Mellie filibusters 
against the defunding of Planned 
Parenthood (even though she’s a 
Republican, but we’ll let it slide). 
She, 
perhaps 
single-handedly, 

embodies the kind of optimistic, 
fictionalized politics that make 
“Scandal” different from the rest of 
T.V.’s D.C.-based dramas.

This season also promises a 

continuation of the unlikely – 
yet totally amazing – friendship 
blooming between Olivia and 
Mellie. Both screwed over by the 
same guy and willing to go to any 
lengths for control of the White 
House, the duo stole the best 
scene of the season six premiere: 
commiserating in style, they drink 
champagne in a marble bathtub.

Once you get passed the fuzzy 

politics and the occasional bouts of 
cringe-y writing, the sixth season 
premiere of “Scandal” delivered 
on the over-the-top theatrics we 
all knew to expect. Although the 
episode was (unfortunately) devoid 
of angsty side-eyes and hot-and-
heavy make out sessions in White 
House closets, it was nevertheless 
entertaining. Olivia Pope is finally 
back, this time with a ginormous 
red prada bag covering up her the 
actress’s baby bump, handling 
business as usual.

She’s nobody’s ‘Fair 
Lady’ but her own lady

Daily Arts Writer Eli Rallo recounts her experience watching a 
reboot of the ‘Pygmalion’ classic through a modern feminist lens

Over the summer, I had 

the 
honor 
of 
seeing 
the 

musical “My Fair Lady” at the 
Baystreet Regional Theatre in 
Sag Harbor, N.Y. I brought a 
hesitancy with me as I went to 
see the golden age Broadway 
musical for the second time 
in my 18 years. I carried with 
me an aversion to the show’s 
portrayal of feminist issues, 
misogyny and the weak view 
of women it creates.

Eliza 
Doolittle, 
the 

protagonist, 
is 
a 
cockney 

flower girl taken in by the 
extravagant Henry Higgins, 
who bets he can turn Eliza 
into a “proper lady” in six 
months. Higgins successfully 
transforms 
Eliza 
through 

misogynistic and tiring tactics 
which diminish her personality 
and qualities, ladylike or not. 
Higgins celebrates his success 
selfishly, completely leaving 
Eliza out. This leads to the 
creation 
of 
her 
polemical 

argument against Higgins at 
the end of act two. Despite 
Eliza’s anger, the show ends 
with a reconciliation of sorts 
between the two. The end 
begs the audience to accept 
that Higgins is a decent guy, 
disregarding everything he 
did to Eliza throughout the 
musicaland poses her as rather 
weak.

Somehow, in the production 

I saw this summer, director 
Michael 
Arden 
(Director 

of the Broadway revival of 
“Spring 
Awakening” 
2015) 

was able to take the original 
text and completely transform 
its 
meaning. 
Through 

stylistic choices (the use of 
set, thrust style staging and 
mood blocking) and a tweak 
of 
that 
infamous 
ending 

scene, the show transformed 
from the story of a glorified 
misogynist 
being 
forgiven 

for his wrongdoings to that 

of a woman going through a 
terribly oppressive time and 
walking away from it stronger. 
The show ends with Higgins 
alone on the stage while the 
cast stripped his entire home 
away from him until the stage 
was bare. Eliza appears in the 
doorway, takes one look at him 
and defiantly turns the other 
way.

I wonder a lot about the 

implications of these classic 
golden 
age 
musicals 
on 

society. 
Pieces 
of 
theatre 

like “Oklahoma,” “Carousel,” 
“Kiss Me Kate,” “The King 

and I,” “Damn Yankees,” are 
all well-known, continuously 
produced pieces from that era. 
Yet they all harbor undertones 
of 
misogyny 
and 
aren’t 

successful in providing the 
view today’s female audience 
needs. Each miserably fail 
the “Bechdel Test”–– a test 
created 
by 
artist 
Alison 

Bechdel to monitor the role 
of women in film and theatre. 
A piece passes the test if it 
includes a scene between two 
women in which they discuss 
something other than a man. It 
is appalling that these pieces of 
theatre, and countless others, 
cannot include dynamic roles 
for women.

One could argue that the 

1950s, the time in which most 
golden age theatre premiered 
on the great white way, are 
to blame. Being a decade 
of 
massive 
oppression 
for 

minority groups and women, 
it is inevitable that the theatre 
of the time would reflect such 
injustices.

There is something very 

relevant and important about 
the material Arden adopted 
and how he was able to 
transform it into something 
strikingly 
different 
from 

the original piece without 
changing the text at all. The 
piece provided hope for the 
musical theatre I’d like to see 
in 2017: less reliant on the 
strong, central male figure 
and 
more 
poised 
to 
give 

women an empowering role in 
a time during which they were 
objectified and pushed down.

Building complexity 
through pity is not 
the Shondaland style


6B — Thursday, February 2, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Aristophanes 
spits 
and 

spins. Her delivery is slippery 
and sharp. In an instant, she 
switches from a whisper to a 
growl, creating sounds unlike 
anything I have ever heard. Her 
words seem to seep from her 
with ease and effortlessness, 
but they bite. Even if, like I, 
you cannot understand her 
slew of Mandarin, the punch of 
emotion is unmistakable.

Though exquisite in her 

execution, 
Aristophanes 
is 

relatively new to the hip-hop 
scene. Hailing from Taipei, 
she began dabbling casually 
in the scene there only a few 
years ago. Growing up, she 
was exposed to very little pop 

culture, making her aggressive 
jump into music all the more 
impressive 
and 
surprising. 

Unlike her male, Taiwanese 
counterparts, 
Aristophanes 

does not use her music as a 
stage for her swagger or to get 
a leg up towards a lush lifestyle 
— she is no braggart and has 
no desire to break into the 
American music scene.

Despite her lack of intention, 

Aristophanes 
slipped 
into 

the American stream when 
featured on “SCREAM,” an 
arresting single from Grimes’s 
2015 Art Angels. Her voice 
paradoxically drips with sex 
and malice, rapping: “You lie 
there / Struggling with the 
body fluid that is getting cold 
/ Sticky, transparent, elastic 
flowers in my palm.” She 
is not one to mince words, 

talking about sex and the 
body with a gothic tilt. Her 
most recent track, “Humans 
Become 
Machines,” 
was 

produced by Grimes and is 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
pair’s 

previous collaboration — dicy 
and surreal.

Her music makes my skin 

tingle; I feel hyperalert and 
slightly 
frightened, 
yet 
so 

much more alive. But it’s 
not only her sound; it’s her. 
Aristophanes 
herself 
is 
a 

force that demands to be felt. 
Nothing about her intersects 
nicely with American hip-
hop convention — not her 
gender, her nationality nor her 
contorted lyrical phrasings. In 
the hegemonic realm of hip-
hop, Aristophanes is a wake-
up call; a blast of freezing, 
refreshing air.

CARLY SNIDER
Senior Arts Editor

She’s only an “it-girl” if I 

want to steal her life. For me, 
that the line to be drawn for the 
definition. Trouble is, the girls 
whose lives I would like to steal 
the most are fictional imprints 
of the author’s imaginations. 
But that does not make me want 
their lives any less. 

Lady Macbeth
The literal and metaphorical 

Queen of “Macbeth.” Was that 
a low-hanging sentence? Yes. 
But it was wholly necessary. 
She’s in a league way above her 
Shakespearean contemporaries; 
she isn’t whiney like Juliet and 
Ophelia, she’s bold, beautiful 
and 
bloodthirsty. 
Lady 

Macbeth is the ultimate badass; 
unapologetically 
ambitious 

and determined. In a time 
when women were thought 
of as nothing but disposable 
accessories, 
she 
mercilessly 

pursued power. Admittedly, her 
proclivity to murder is a little 
off-putting, but a girl’s got to 
have some flaws. 

Anne Shirley
Red-headed and befreckled 

Anne Shirley of “Ann of Green 

Gables” is nothing short of 
ridiculous. She personifies the 
term “extra” a century before it 
even came into existence. She is 
unabashedly melodramatic –– 
after accidentally dying her much 
loathed red hair green she wails 
that her life cannot possibly go 
on. But her over-the-top nature 

only adds to her endless charm 
and fuels her unparalleled sense 
of imagination. 

Hermione Granger
The true hero of the Harry 

Potter series. Or, at least, to 
nerdy know-it-all girls like me. 
Those two buffoons would be no 
where if it wasn’t for Hermione’s 
logic, wits and ingenuity. Being 
a witch is undeniably cool, 

but being the best witch in a 
wizarding 
school 
infinitely 

cooler.

Eloise
No one can pull off an egg 

cup hat like Eloise. The little 
diva, who lives in the Plaza 
Hotel, made life at The Plaza 
so alluring. Plus she was in 
possession of just about the 
coolest pets a six-year-old could 
possibly have: Weenie the pug 
and Skipperdee the turtle.

Scout Finch
Universally beloved. Arguably 

the greatest thing is to be loved by 
all, and “To Kil a Mockingbird” 
’s Scout’s narration captures the 
heart of all. She’s intelligent, 
mischievous 
and 
genuinely 

good, in a way that perhaps only 
a child can be. 

I’ll admit it: I have dreamed 

of being a model after a Bella 
Hadid Instagram binge. Or a 
food stylist (which might be 
the best job ever) after scrolling 
through Molly Yeh’s picturesque 
page. But while I’m not immune 
to coveting these cool girls’ cool 
lives, I don’t lust after them the 
way I do with literary heroines. 
The lives of female protagonists 
don’t have to fall under the 
constaints of modern society, 
but instead are abound with 
thrill and melodrama.
