UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
ReSearchers concerned for
future of federal funding

Experts: Impact
of 'don't ask, don't
tell' repeal unclear
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
LGBTQ rights advocates
on campus celebrated in the
wake of the official repeal of
the U.S. military's "don't ask,
don't tell" policy on Tues-
day. But the
repeal also office
raised ques-
tions about HQORS
how it will
affect military programs both
nationally and at the Univer-
sity.
Following the repeal of
DADT, University professors
and campus organizations
discussed the merits of the
overturn of the legislation
in advancing LGBTQ policy,
while acknowledging there
is much work to be done. The
policy had banned openly gay
soldiers from serving in the
military since 1993.
In an event held Tuesday
night in the Welker Room of
the Michigan Union, about 20
members of the University's

chapter of Stonewall Demo-
crats and LGBTQ rights sup-
porters gathered to celebrate
the upending of the DADT
policy and to discuss how the
repeal will affect the nation.
The Stonewall Democrats,
many of whom were clad in
buttons that read "Ask, Tell,"
celebrated and proclaimed
that the day was "long over-
due" and a "big step for
equality." Others, while still
heralding the day as a mile-
stone for LGBTQ rights, said
it was just one victory for a
cause that still has ground to
gain until complete equality is
achieved.
Blake Mackie, co-chair of
the Stonewall Democrats,
said in an interview after
the event that despite other
laws in place that currently
hinder LGBTQ rights, the
DADT repeal is a milestone in
advancing LGBTQ civil liber-
ties.
"'Don't ask, don't tell' was
an ineffective policy that
resulted in the discharge of
many able and qualified ser-
vice members and the silenc-
ing of LGBTQ Americans,"
Mackie said. "(The end of)
'don't ask, don't tell' was real-

Sustainability
research may not see
sharp funding drop
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
DailyStaffReporter
Despite the University's
record-high research spending
this past fiscal year, researchers
are concerned about the future
of their projects because of

potential"funding cuts.
Research expenditures at the
University grew 8.5 percent to
$1.24 billion this past fiscal year,
with a 9.8-percent increase in
federal funding accounting for
much of the growth. But Ste-
phen Forrest, the University's
vice president for research, said
the University might see a sig-
nificant decrease in funding this
coming year.
"I think I'm fairly safe in say-
ing that the growth in research

fundingfrom the federal govern-
ment is going to be slowed this
year quite considerably," Forrest
said.
For the 2011 fiscal year, fed-
eral funds accounted for 66.7 per-
cent of the University's research
spending, according to a Sept.
20 University press release. The
National Institutes of Health
increased its grant money to the
University by 12.6 percent for
that year, the National Science

SPRING COMMENCEMENT 2012 ________________
Students nominate Mark
Zuckerberg as grad. speaker

200 students sign
petition in support of
Facebook founder
By K.C.WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
After protests erupted follow-
ing announcement that Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder would be
the commencement speaker last
spring, some members of the class

of 2012 are determined to find a
speaker they want to hear.
In an effort to do this, LSA
senior Jake Steinerman started a
petition over the summer to have
Facebook founder Mark Zucker-
berg serve as the keynote speaker
for the 2012 Spring Commence-
ment ceremony.
"The whole point of having the
speakers is to inspire the graduat-
ing class, to take what you've heard
and apply it to the real world, and
I think his story, to me atleast, has

been very inspiring," Steinerman
said.
Steinerman's petition currently
has about 200 signatures, and he
has continued to raise awareness
for his cause on - you guessed it
- Facebook.
"I'm not relying solely on Face-
book, but I think it would be awe-
some if it could be driven by social
media," Steinerman said. "That
would sort of prove its case further
and show that what he's done has a

As the world continues to
examine the role of social media
in recent uprisings in the Middle

East and North Africa, Sultan
Sooud Al-Qassemi, a Twitter
commentator, lecturer and glob-
al policy scholar with exper-
tise in the Middle East, spoke

Store owner
says foot traffic
has decreased
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor fashionistas have
only a month left to get the lat-
est fall trends at women's cloth-
ing boutique Poshh, which will
be closing next month after 10

years of business.
Poshh owner Wendy Batiste-
Johnson recently announced
that the store on East Liberty
Street will close on Oct. 30.
Batiste-Johnson, who said she
has been contemplating the
decision for a few months, is
closing the shop to spend more
time with her family.
"The main reason that I have
decided to close is that this is our
10-year milestone, and I have
two small children," Batiste-

Johnson said. "... I just really
wanted to spend more time with
mykids. Runningabusiness and
having a familyis extremely dif-
ficult ... I've missed out on a lot
and I'd like to not miss out on
anymore."
Poshh opened in 2001 when
Batiste-Johnson moved to Ann
Arbor with her husband, a Uni-
versity alum, and took note of
the need for more retail stores
in the downtown area.

What classes do you teach?
My staple course every fall
is Law and Philosophy. We talk
about equality under the law,
especially in the U.S. Constitu-
tion. I've been teaching it since
the 1990s. The course fulfills the
race and ethnicity requirement,
so I do want to get students
thinking about the meanings of
race and the realities of racial
inequality in the United States
and how the law can be used
as an 'instrument to promote
equality.
How did you come to work
in philosophy at the Univer-
sity?
I came here in 1987 right
after earning my Ph.D. at Har-
vard where I studied with John

Rawls - the very famous John
Rawls. Michigan made me an
offer, and it was the best offer I
had, so I came here.
You're working on a his-
tory of egalitarianism. How's
that going?
The dominant view is known
as luck egalitarianism, which
says that what's unjust is any-
one being worse off than anyone
else on the basis of pure luck. My
view is that egalitarianism real-
ly isn't about luck or un-luck, it's
fundamentally about eliminat-
ing oppression. Its main focus
should be on unequal social
relations between people.
What's your teaching phi-
losophy?
My main philosophy is get-

ting students thinking for them-
selves. That's really the heart of
higher education. It's not just
receiving a lot of information
from the instructor but learning
how to do stuff with it on your
own.
What's next for you?
I am now the director of the
soon-to-be-launched Philoso-
phy, Politics and Economics
concentration. Students will
take courses from all three
units. I hope students will keep
their ears pricked for more
information. The first course
offering under the designation
PPE will be taught by me next
winter.

Members of the Mexican Navy stand guard over seized telecommunications equipment, allegedly built by the Zetas
drug cartel, during a media presentation in Veracruz, Mexico, on Thursday Sept. 8, 201.
Leading Mexican gangs
make presence known

Zetas drug cartel
recently accused of
crimes, including
attacking civilians
VERACRUZ, Mexico (AP) -
A gang known to be aligned with
Mexico's most-wanted drug lord
appears to be making a violent
challenge to the dominant Zetas
Cartel in the Gulf state of Vera-
cruz, dumping 35 bodies on a
busy avenue in front of horri-
fied motorists near where the
nation's top prosecutors were
about to start a convention.
The cartel known as the New
Generation unloaded the bound,
seminude, tortured bodies dur-
ing rush hour Tuesday as part
of a several-month campaign to
take the strategic port of Vera-
cruz now controlled by the Zetas
drug gang, an official in the
Mexican armed forces told The.
Associated Press on yesterday.
All 35 victims, who included
12 women and two minors, were
linked to the Zetas cartel, said
the official, who couldn't be
quoted by name for security rea-
sons.
It was the first official
acknowledgment of who may
have carried out the attack after
a banner left at the scene threat-
ened the Zetas and bore the ini-
tials "G.N."

A U.S. law enforcement offi-
cial said the New Generation is
believed to be linked to Joaquin
"El Chapo" Guzman, widely con-
sidered the world's wealthiest
drug trafficker.
But the U.S. official, who also
could not be quoted by name for
security reasons, said it would be
surprising to see heavy involve-
ment in Veracruz by Guzman or
his Sinaloa cartel, which is based
in the Pacific coast state of the
same name on the other side of
Mexico.
"We don't have anything that
corroborates or disputes" that
the body dumping was linked to
Guzman, the U.S. official said,
adding that other sources say
the Gulf Cartel could have been
responsible. "Sometimes these
criminal groups blame the other
guys."
Drug trafficking in Veracruz
was long controlled by the Gulf
Cartel. But the business has been
taken over by the Zetas, who had
acted as enforcers for the Gulf
Cartel before breaking away in
early 2010 and waging a bloody
war with their former allies
across northeastern Mexico.
The Zetas presence in Vera-
cruz has grown since the gov-
ernment launched a crackdown
late last year in their main base
of Tamaulipas, a border state to
the north. But the gang has also
been hit hard in Veracruz by
Mexican army and navy opera-

tions, leaving them weakened
and vulnerable to challenges
from rival gangs, the Mexican 1
military official said.
This Gulf coast city is Mexi-
co's busiest port for commercial
goods.
The official said there is no
way to inspect all the contain-
ers coming in. He said many of 0
the drug smuggled in come from
Central American, an area where
the Zetas have been expanding.
The state is also a main transit
route for cocaine and migrants
coming from the Guatemalan
border. The Zetas have con-
trolled the corridor, the Mexican
official said.
A banner left with the bodies
Tuesday criticized the Zetas for
killing innocents and charging
extortion, warning: "No more."
The Mexican officical said the
New Generation gang has been
carrying out what it calls "sur-
gical" attacks that target Zetas
only and no civilians.
Security expert Raul Benitez
agreed that the attack could be
the work of a gang aligned with
Guzman, who is forming alli-
ances to attack the Zetas in other
parts of Mexico. He said Guz-
man is seeking both to control
territory and to punish the Zetas
for attacking civilians, some-
thing that is shunned by most
drug traffickers and that has
ramped up government heat on
all cartels.

LANSING, Mich.
Republicans push
ban on partial-
birth abortions
The Republican-led Michigan
Legislature on yesterday took
key votes toward approving a
state-level ban on a procedure
opponents call "partial-birth"
abortion.
A proposal to put a ban on the
late-term procedure in state law
passed the Senate by a 29-8 vote
yesterday. Similar but separate
legislation passed the House by a
75-33 vote. Lawmakers must pass
the same bills before they can be
sent to Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der, but that could happen within
the next few weeks.
Supporters say a state ban
would make it easier to prosecute
cases in Michigan and keep the
ban in place in case the federal
law changes.
WASHINGTON
House panel
approves bill for
Peace Corps safety
A House panel has approved
legislation to improve safety and
security for Peace Corps volun-
teers after criticism that the agen-
cy did little to train its workers to
deal with violent attacks such as
rape and murder.
By voice vote yesterday, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
pushed ahead two bills that would
establish a process for volunteers
to make confidential reports of
rape or sexual assault, set up train-
ing for staff on how to respond and
create aVictim Support Office.
In May, three Peace Corps vol-
unteers raped while serving over-
seas and the mother of a fourth
who was murdered in Benin com-
plained to lawmakers. They said
the agency failed to train its work-
ers about how to avoid or deal with
violent attacks. They also said it
was insensitive or unhelpful.
LONDON
U.K. officials vow

riots last month
Young people who looted
stores as riots erupted across
England last month were let

allow them to have faith in their
own futures, Britain's deputy
prime minister said yesterday.
Addressing an annual rally of
his Liberal Democrat party, the
junior partner in Britain's coali-
tion government, Nick Clegg
pledged new help for disadvan-
taged youths to divert them from
criminality.
Arson, disorder and theft
spread through London and
other major English cities for
four days in August. Five people
were killed and scores of stores
were looted, with youths blamed

for inciting and carrying out
much of the damage.
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN
Assassination of
Afghan president
hurts peace deal
The assassination of a for-
mer Afghan president reflects
the dangers of negotiations with
the Taliban: Any effort toward a
peace deal canbring deadly action
to stop it from factions within the
multi-headed insurgency.
Now supporters of the slain
Burhanuddin Rabbani angrily
warned yesterday that there is
no hope in seeking negotiations,
a key policy of President Hamid
Karzai that the United States
has backed. Afghans involved in
peace efforts are fearful of reach-
ing out to anyone within the
Taliban and risk being targeted
themselves.
Many fear such assassinations
could accelerate as the Taliban
and other insurgents try to bol-
ster their positions ahead of a
planned withdrawal of U.S. and
other international combat forc-
es at the end of 2014.

Health care
law proves
beneficial
for youth
1 million young
adults insured in
three months
WASHINGTON (AP) - At
least one part of President
Barack Obama's health care
overhaul has proven popular.
With the economy sputtering,
the number of young adults
covered by health insurance
grew by about a million as
families flocked to take advan-
tage of a new benefit in the law.
Two surveys released
yesterday - one by the gov-
ernment, another by Gallup
- found significantly fewer
young adults going without
coverage even as the over-
all number of uninsured
remained high.
The government's National
Center for Health Statistics
found that the number of
uninsured people ages 19-25
dropped from 10 million last
year to 9.1 million in the first
three months of this year, a
sharp decline over such a brief
period.
New data from an ongoing
Gallup survey found that the
share of adults 18-25 without
coverage dropped from 28 per-
cent last fall to 24.2 percent
by this summer. That drop
translates to roughly 1 million
or more young adults gaining
coverage.
The new health care law
allows young adults to remain
on their parents' health plans
until theyturn 26.

A man chants during a vigil for Georgia death row inmate Troy Davis In Jackson, Ga. yesterday.
Georgia executes Troy Davis

Davis: 'Look deeper
into this case so
that you can finally
see the truth.'
JACKSON, Ga. (AP) - Georgia
executed Troy Davis last night for
the murder of an off-duty police
officer, a crime he denied commit-
ting right to the end as supporters
around the world mourned and
declared that an innocent man
was put to death.
As he lay strapped to a gur-
ney in the death chamber, the
42-year-old told relatives of Mark
MacPhail that he was not respon-
sible for his 1989 slaying. "I did not
have a gun," he insisted.
"All I can ask ... is that you look
deeper into this case so that you

really can finally see the truth,"
he said.
He asked his friends and family
to "continue to fight this fight." Of
prison officials he said, "may God
have mercy on your souls. May
God bless your souls."
Davis was declared dead at
11:08 p.m. The lethal injection
began about 15 minutes earlier,
after the Supreme Court rejected
an 11th-hour request for a stay.
"Justice has been served for
Officer Mark MacPhail and his
family," state Attorney General
Sam Olens said in a statement.
Thehigh courtdid not comment
on its order, which came about four
hours after it received the request
and more than three hours after
the planned execution time.
Hundreds of thousands of
people signed petitions on Davis'
behalf, and prominent support-

ers included an ex-president and
an ex-FBI director, liberals and
conservatives. His attorneys
said seven of nine key witnesses
against him disputed all or parts
of their testimony, but state and
federal judges repeatedly ruled
against him - three times on
Wednesday alone.
MacPhail's widow, Joan
MacPhail-Harris, said there was
"nothing to rejoice," but that it
was "a time for healing for all
families."
"I will grieve for the Davis
family because now they're going
to understand our pain and our
hurt," she said in a telephone
interview from Jackson. "My
prayers go out to them. I have
been praying for them all these
years. And I pray there will be
some peace along the way for
them."

Davis' supporters staged vigils
in the U.S. and Europe, declar-
ing "I am Troy Davis" on signs,
T-shirts and the Internet. Some
tried increasingly frenzied mea-
sures, urging prison workers to
stay home and even posting a
judge's phone number online,
hoping people will press him to
put a stop to the lethal injection.
President Barack Obama deflect-
ed calls for him to get involved.
"They say death row; we say
hell no!" protesters shouted out-
side the Jackson prison before
Davis was executed. In Washing-
ton, a crowd outside the Supreme
Court yelled the same chant.
As many as 700 demonstrators
gathered outside the prison as a
few dozen riot police stood watch,
but the crowd thinned as the
night wore on and the outcome
became clear.

FRO TE QMl
The Big 'Green' House
'U' officials should consider solar panel project
group of alternative energy supporters are looking to make
the Big House a little greener. Ann Arbor 350, a project
of the Ecology Center - a nonprofit environmental orga-
nization based in Ann Arbor - is petitioning to have solar panels
installed on Michigan Stadium. The effort will continue through
the fall with supporters acquiring signatures on Football Saturdays
and circulating the petition online. The University should respond
to this petition by seriously looking into the possibility of solar pan-
els or other eco-friendly energy initiatives for the athletic facilities.

The panels will make a statement about
the University's commitment to bettering
the environment and reducing the use of
fossil fuels. Monica Patel, a policy specialist
at the Ecology Center, is calling on Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman, Athletic
Director David Brandon and Terry Alexan-
der executive director of the Office of Cam-
pus Sustainability to lead the initiative in the
pursuit of alternative forms of energy. This
venture would make the Big House the first
NCAA school to pursue such an eco-friendly
endeavor.
There are professional sports teams that
have already installed solar panels at their
stadiums. The Washington Redskins of the
National Football League have begun using
solar panels that provide up to 20 percent of
Fed-Ex Field's game day electricity. The Seat-
tle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles have
also embraced green technology efforts such
as wind turbines and bio-fuel. Solar technol-
ogy is used in Major League Baseball as well:
The San Francisco Giants, Boston Red Sox,
Cleveland Indians and Colorado Rockies
have solar panels installed on the roof of their
respective stadiums. In all cases, the technol-
ogy serves to offset conventional energy usage
and reduce emissions.
The Big House and Chrysler Arena have

undergone recent renovations, but increasing
energy efficiency at these facilities should be
a priority. The University has the opportunity
to have the first NCAA stadium to use solar
technology, and regardless of whether solar
panels are the answer to sustaining Michigan
Stadium, something should be done to reduce
the environmental impact of the most famous
icon of the University's athletics.
In spite of its obvious benefits, the practi-
cality of the project is a major concern. The
findings of a feasibility assessment done in
2009 show that the most efficient module, if
installed, would displace 9 percent of the sta-
dium's energy load per hour, while also reduc-
ing other harmful emissions. However, even
with these benefits, solar panels are costly.
The report estimated the installation of solar
panels would cost about $1.5 million. It would
take 26 years for that amount tobe paidback in
energy saved. The University should explore
all cost-effective possibilities for alternative
fuel before committingto a plan.
The University and the Athletic Depart-
ment should look seriously into whether solar
panels or other alternative fuels are viable
options to power the Big House. Solar panels
have already been implemented with success
at several professional athletic venues, and the
University should pioneer these efforts.

f I could turn the clock back to
my freshman year, one thing
I'd make sure to do is thor-
oughly read Cal Newport's blog,
Study Hacks.
His blog has
changed how
I view success
and how I aim to
achieve it during
and after col-
lege. Here are a
few things I've
learned from ERIK
Newport's blog: TORENBERG
Master a rare
and valuable
skill; don't spread yourself too thin.
Send your c-mails in large batches;
don't whimsically check your inbox
throughout the entire day. Focus
on working right; don't brood over
finding the "right work."
But perhaps my favorite idea of
Newport's is one - if I had imple-
mented earlier - I believe would
have significantly improved my
student experience: Have a Grand
Project.
Throughout college, I majored in
economics and became involved in
a couple extracurricular organiza-
tions. Problem sets and meetings
took up a large chunk of my sched-
ule, leaving me little time to pursue
my own projects. I once told myself
I would start an organization dedi-
cated to restructuring education
paradigms, but I never got around
to it. I once told myself that I would
write a screenplay about my first
years of college, but I never got
around to that either.
It's unfortunate because these
projects were the experiences that
would have enriched my life per-
sonally, socially and profession-
ally. Amid many of my academic
requirements that failed to elicit my
complete engagement, these were
the opportunities to actualize what
I truly wanted and believed in. Of
course, it's never too late, but it's
better to start early.
And it's not like such ambitious,
exciting projects are simply unre-

alistic. My friend Alex O'Dell, Ger-
ald R. Ford School of Public Policy
Senior, filmed a documentary a cou-
ple summers ago in India, and then
presented it on campus this past
weekend. My friend Allen Kim, Col-
lege of Engineering senior, started
his own business last year, Beba-
rang, and this year he is working on
it full time. Alumni AJ Holmes, Ali
Gordon and Carlos valdes (who I
would like to have as friends), wrote
an entire musical inone summer and
then gave a captivating performance
at TEDxUofM lastyear.
These projects were not complet-
ed through any formal programs.
These students pursued their pas-
sions on their own terms.
What they did was perform
Grand Projects.
If while reading this, you've been
thinking, "Well, I've always wanted
to do 'X,"' or if looking back at your
years at the University, you'd be
incredibly proud of yourself if you
accomplished a certain "X," then
I implore you to make that your
Grand Project - to at least try "X."
A Grand Project is an opportu-
nity for you to pursue your passions
or merely explore your interests. It's
also an opportunity for you to com-
bine your class work, extracurricular
activities and free time into a person-
alized project, customized to your
beliefs, talents and idiosyncrasies. A
Grand Project may even help you, as
it did Allen Kim, discover what you
would like to do after college.
A Grand Project will leave you
bustling down the hallways, induce
exciting ideas when you least
expect them and infuse your daily
life with a sense of purpose and sig-
nificance.
But what if you don't have an idea
for a Grand Project? If your "X" is,
like mine was, "something impact-
ful" and "you'll just know it when
you see it," then pursue an interest
on the side, and see where it takes
you. Or perhaps you already have
a full schedule with classes and
extracurricular activities. That's
fine, as long as they satisfy the "X"

condition mentioned above. If they
don't, find a way to tailor your cur-
rent activities into a Grand Project,
and if that's not possible, it may be
helpful to re-evaluate.
After you decide what you'd like
to accomplish, where do you begin?
Newport provides some recommen-
dations: First, talk to people who've
done something similar in the past.
Learn where they succeeded, and
learn where they failed. Second,
set clear expectations and goals
for yourself and your Grand Proj-
ect. Third, ensure that you receive
feedback consistently. Applying to a
competition, publicizing your work
or sharing it with close friends will
confirm that you are either on your
way to achieving your goal or that
you are behind and need to catch up.

Think beyvond yourself

xcuse me, I'd like to make
a toast. I'm usually not one
for formalities, but I'd like
to welcome the
class of 2015 to
Ann Arbor.
Congratula-
tions freshmen,
you should feel
fantastic about
yourselves s
right now. NoE
but really, you EAGHAN
nailed the ACT. DAVIS
You managed to
remain in the top
15 percent of your class and coast-
ed through senior year. Just a few
months ago you received your Mich-
igan-embossed acceptance letter.
It was a silver platter, a metaphori-
cal promissory note guaranteeing a
bright socioeconomic future.
Enough with the pleasantries.
You're here now, and you'd like to
know what it's really like inside this
place. If you ask that question the way
your overzealous parents will during
fallbreak, the answerswill come eas-
ily. Yes, the cafeterias aren't horrible.
Yes, the weather is bearable. And yes,
your fraternity's beer olympics are
highly competitive, and of course,
you won. Just kidding. Underage
drinking is illegal and immoral.
So here it is. Throw out any infor-
mation your cheesy tour guide told
you. We'd be kidding ourselves if we
explained college in terms of green
grass, pretty buildings and prestige.
I'm not trying to insult anyone, but
think about it - there are pretty
buildings, unique restaurants and
green grass in every college town.
The one you chose to inhabit isn't
special. If you're wondering what it's
like to be a college student, my sug-
gestion is to do yourself this favor:
Forget the reason why you chose to

come to the University, forget rank-
ings and forget showboating your
acceptance letter. Let your father
hang the letter in his office. Don't
worry, he'll keep it safe. You have no
use for it right now.
I know if I were reading this last
year, I'd have a few four-letter words
in mind. I've single-handedly dimin-
ished all you've strived for. Believe
me, I know you were an all-star in
high school. Yet, today you're here,
and here is an odd sanctuary in this
country. College is a place where
people think too hard. They think
beyond sense and sometimes beyond
their personal achievements.
Thinking beyond yourself - your
achievements and views - is, I
believe, the most valuable lesson I
learned last year. It starts when you
consider this: Your thoughts, your
very existence and the world have all
been shaped through the experienc-
es you've had prior to stepping foot
on campus. It's a simple idea, and yet
so often it's out of reach. The way you
think may not be correct (it probably
isn't.) It can and will change. Other
people think differently, whether
they come from across the world or
down the street. Maybe they're right.
If you get on board with this idea,
you feel your core challenged on a
deeper level than you've experienced
before. This year, you may expect
that in your fall political science lec-
ture you'll affirm why your political
views are correct. After your mid-
term you'll find problems not with
your views but with our whole politi-
cal system.
It begins to spread. Your new
friends are "those people." They
begin to seem not so horrible after
all. Maybe you won't burn them at
the stake. Maybe you'll date one of
them and not tell mom and dad. You
might adopt the view your father has

told you to ignore 1,000 times. You'll
explore and probably accept new
political, religious and social ideas.
Then you'll realize views are every-
thing but concrete, and you'll change
them once again.
You might look at people different
from you and take something from
their beliefs. You'll be humbled a
bit. I was, and I still am. This way of
questioning everything around you
won't make you sure; it will make you
radically unsure, at least temporar-
ily. Yet, knowledge is not confirma-
tion. Knowledge by its roots is new,
and if you want to gain more insight,
you must go beyond what you already
know. And what do you know better
than yourself?
Throw out what
your campus tour
guide told you.
So freshmen (I hope you're still
with me), give this philosophy a try-
it would be hard anywhere else with-
out dorms and libraries with millions
of books at your disposal.
This difference will open your
mind. Then you'll know what being a
student at the University can be like.
Get ready. If it happens, many things
you thought were important won't be
anymore - and you won't care. You
probably won't realize it. It may be
your greatest accomplishment.
Anyway, that's what I think of
Michigan right now. You might
disagree in a few months, and so
might I.

ly important ... to show the prog-
ress that can be made on LGBTQ
issues."
However, he added that prog-
ress still needs to be made on
issues such as the prohibition
of gay men from donating blood
and the denial of military ben-
efits for partners of those serv-
ing in the military. Additionally,
though gay and lesbian soldiers
are now able to serve openly, the
repeal of "don't ask, don't tell"
did not grant that right to trans-
gender soldiers, Mackie noted.
David Halperin, the Univer-
sity's W.H. Auden distinguished
university professor of the his-
tory and theory of sexuality,
said the repeal of "don't ask,
don't tell" was "a step forward"
and has the potential to advance
other LGBTQ issues.
"As anti-gay discrimination
becomes more and more rare,
it looks more and more bizarre
and archaic to more and more
people, and you wonder why it
still exists," Halperin said. "So
once various kinds of equal-
ity come into being, remaining
forms of inequality look more
and more strange and intoler-
able."
Halperin also noted that the
repeal of the legislation will
allow for more universities
around the nation to institute

Reserved Officers' Training
Corps programs, since many
have previously refused them on
the basis that the program was
not open to students of all sexu-
al orientations.
Additionally, Halperin said
many military leaders have
supported the repeal for years.
Because of this, Halperin said he
does not foresee any problems as
gay and lesbian soldiers begin to
openly enlist in the military.
"It's been clear for a long time
that the only real defenders of
the policy in the military and
in Washington are the elderly
generals and senators who were
pretty much out of touch," Hal-
perin said.
Ariana Bostian-Kentes, the
administrative and program-
ming coordinator for the Uni-
versity's Spectrum Center, said
she expects gay and lesbian
soldiers to join the military at
a greater rate than during the
era of "don't ask, don't tell." She
added that the repeal plays a
crucial role in encouraging dia-
logue on LGBTQ issues and how
to overturn policies that limits
LGBTQ rights.
She added that the repeal of
"don't ask, don't tell" could help
to root out other "glaring ineq-
uities" in LGBTQ rights includ-
ing the Defense of Marriage Act
and unfavorable marriage laws
in most states.
"I think this is going to be
a huge gateway in increasing

equality for the entire commu-
nity," Bostian-Kentes said. "The
military is such a well-respect-
ed, highly-regarded institution
that when you see that service
members are able to serve open-
ly and we have a more effective
military ... it's going to change
people's minds and open doors."
Still, others were not con-
vinced that the end of the policy
would bring a deluge of military
enlistment among gay and les-
bian soldiers. Jonathan Marwil,
a University lecturer of history,
who teaches a course on 2oth-
century wars as a social expe-
rience, said he anticipates a
wait-and-see approach as poten-
tial LGBTQ soldiers determine
how "welcoming" the program
will be after the repeal.
"Ifa year goes by and this has
worked fairly smoothly - there
aren't instances of people being
picked on, humiliated, injured ...
then you will see more sign-up,
absolutely," Marwil said.
Like Marwil, leaders of the
University's ROTC programs
said they could not predict
increased enlistment. The
ROTC officials also declined to
comment on the implications of
the repeal. Lt. Colonel Wayne
Doyle, the assistant chair of the
University's Army ROTC, and
Captain Richard Vanden Heu-
vel, commanding officer of the
University's Navy ROTC, said
they would follow orders as
received from command.

Middle East, often times the only
way to communicate is social

The use of social media dur-
ing uprisings in countries such
as Libya, Egypt and Tunisia over
the past year has gained atten-
tion worldwide. Social media
is also particularly valuable in
these countries, Al-Qassemi
said, because mobile devices help
people who are geographically
spread-apart contact each other.
Social media tools also cre-
ate distinct problems in Arab
countries because many dicta-
torial governments do not want
citizens to speak out against the
government. He said citizens

gy increased by 30.4 percent.
However, the Department of
Defense decreased its funding
for the University by 4.9 percent
in 2010-2011 compared to the
previous year, the press release
states.
The University's future suc-
cess in receiving federal grants
will depend on how competi-
tive the University is and what
research areas are being empha-
sized, Forrest added. He added
that researchers at the Universi-
ty have recognized the benefits
that their research can provide
beyond campus.
"The faculty at the University
of Michigan have been extreme-
ly competitive," he said. "(They)
have recognized that one of
things that they can do, and
they can do well for the country
- and particularly the state - is
to do good research and create
those innovations."

"I've always had a love of
fashion, but for me it was a
desire to bring something new
to the Ann Arbor area," Batiste-
Johnson said. "I was 22 years
old, and I decided to take a risk,
and the risk paid off for me."
While Batiste-Johnson said
the recent lack of foot traffic on
East Liberty has affected her
boutique, she noted that the
support of locals and University
students has allowed her to stay
in business.
"We've been very fortunate
in having a long-lasting busi-
ness that has been supported by
not only the University, but by
the surrounding areas," Batiste-
Johnson said. "We've had a
wonderful connection with our
clients, and because of that, our
clients stay loyal to us."
While she has watched East
Liberty transform over the past

10 yeas as stores moved in and
out of the area, Batiste-John-
son said she believes coopera-
tion among the businesses on
the street could help improve
sales.

Al-Qassemi also spoke of the
importance of his own online
community, where he has 78,000
Twitter followers.
"The social media also pro-
vide an avenue for me to tell my
family which areas they should
avoid, which areas are danger-
ous at a given time," he said.
Al-Qassemi also noted that
he is "on the record and not
afraid" of his beliefs and convic-
tions about the Middle East and
the political development in the
region.
Al-Qassemi concluded his lec-
ture by saying that even in times
of unrest, he is optimistic about
the future of Arab countries.
"Not everything will go the
way we want it to go, but the
vehicle communication and
safety. His project was recently
awarded $14.9 million, with 80
percent of the funding coming
from the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
Though Sayer said he isn't
concerned that his current proj-
ect will suffer from a decrease
in federal funding, he acknowl-
edged that he is worried about
upcoming research endeavors.
"Certainly we're concerned
about other programs that will
be happening in the future,"
Sayer said.
He added that focusing on
environmental sustainability
in the future could be a way to
receive federal research funds
for other projects.
"I think we have the opportu-
nity to see a growth in research
funding as a result of increased
interest in sustainability," Sayer
said.
Huei Peng, executive direc-
tor of the University Inter-
disciplinary and Professional
Engineering Programs, said he
thinks there is an urgent need
to solve sustainability issues,
which is why it is such a pop-
ular research topic. Peng is
working with the U.S. Clean

lished by the U.S. Department
she said. "My hope is that busi-
nesses would do as such or do it
more so there could be a larger
attraction to the area."
Catherine Berlucchi, man-
ager of Allure Boutique on
East Liberty, said the closing
of Poshh doesn't come as a sur-
prise.
"I was not surprised because
I know her on a personal level
as well, and I know she has
small kids that she wants to be
with all the time," Berlucchi
said.
Berlucchi added that the
closing of Poshh could either
increase her business, as
Poshh's customers will be
looking for a new boutique, or
decrease it as foot traffic in the
area may go down with the clo-
sure of Poshh and Borders. The
East Liberty Street Borders
- a 37,000-square-foot area -
closed last week.
While Batiste-Johnson said
she doesn't know what business

will fill Poshh's spot, Berlucchi
said she hopes to see another
retail store in the East Liberty
location.
"I think Ann Arbor (residents
need) another nice clothing
boutique to go to," Berlucchi
said. "I would like to see anoth-
er retail spot go in there - wom-
en's or men's."
Batiste-Johnson said Poshh

Public Policy junior Kevin
Mersol-Barg said he appreci-
ated the choice of Al-Qassemi as
a speaker because of his unique
background.
"Knowing that this profes-
sional speaker was coming from
a financial background, this is
something not generally asso-
ciated with that (social media)
profession," Mersol-Barg said.
"He took his skill set from his
job and tied it into something the
community needed."

mental blueprints.
The CERC-CVC will receive
$12.5 million over the next five
years, which will be matched
through private funding, for a
total of $25 million. But Peng
stressed that money is not the
most crucial component of a
research project.
"The most important thing is
the quality of the researchers,"
Peng said. "The way to grow
our research is not to focus on
money."
Peng said the University's
reputation as a top research
institution did help the CERC-
CVC and other prominent Uni-
versity initiatives receive the
money they needed.
Peng added that even if the
federal government makes sig-
nificant cuts in research spend-
ing, he hopes funds for the
CERC-CVC will be the last to get
cut. He said the work being done
by the center is a multi-nation
commitment that is important
to the global community. He
added that he thinks the project

wide sale during the shop's last
month of business. Though she
is sad to leave Poshh's custom-
ers, Batiste-Johnson said she
has no regrets since owning and
developing her business was so
satisfying.
"(Poshh) has been my life,
and it has probably been the
most rewarding 10 years of my
life," she said. "There are no
regrets where I'm concerned,
and I'm just so happy that we
had the opportunity to service
the Ann Arbor community and
the surrounding cities the way
we have. We've had a wonder-
ful following - I wouldn't have
lasted 10 years if we had not."
LSA freshman Laurel Ruza,
who has shopped at Poshh, was
surprised to hear of the forth-
coming closure.
"I'm really taken aback,"
Ruza said. "I thought it was a
really popular store. I'm from
West Bloomfield, Mich., and
everybody there talks about

Poshh. It's the place to be."
However, Ruza added that
she often shops at chain stores
like American Apparel and
Urban Outfitters located near-
by Poshh in the East Liberty
area.
"If I go shopping, that's usu-
ally where I head to," Ruza said.
"Some of the independent stores
like Poshh are really cute and
off-the-beaten track, but I stick
mostly to the chain stores."

tremendous effect on our lives."
Though Steinerman hopes sup-
port for his petition will guarantee
Zuckerberg as the commencement
speaker, there are many steps that
need to be takenbefore he becomes
eligible - including submitting
a nomination to the University's
Honorary Degree Committee.
Traditionally, commencement
speakers are awarded an honor-
ary degree for their achievements,
but before they can receive their
degree, they must get approval
from the committee, which is com-
prised of University officials, pro-
fessors, alumni and two student
representatives.
The committee typically meets
twice a year - once in November
and once in April - and selects
people the committee members
believe meet a set criteria. Their
selections are then shown to
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, who recommends any
number of people to receive an
honorary degree and one person
to receive a degree and speak at
commencement. Her recommen-
dations then go to the University's
Board of Regents for approval.
People can nominate speakers
by filling out a form located on the
website of the office of the Presi-
dent. The deadline for submitting a
nomination is Oct. 7.
According to the committee's
nomination criteria, one of the
committee's primary consider-
ations is that the recipient has
"distinguished achievement in an

activity related to the University's
missions of research and scholar-
ship, education or service."
Lisa Connolly, project manager
in the Office of the President, said
though the committee provides a
selection of potential speakers and
honorarydegree recipientsto Cole-
man, Coleman likes to hear feed-
back from students about who they
want as a commencement speaker
- whether it be in the form of a
petition with hundreds of signa-
tures or justone student's opinion.
"I don't think there's a magic
number as far as signatures (on
the petition)," Connolly said. "She
takes all requests she gets from stu-
dents very seriously. Even if it just
came in an e-mail from a student
saying'itwouldbegreatifwe could
get this person to be a commence-
ment speaker."'
According to Connolly, another
way students can contribute to the
selection processis to bringdesired
commencement speaker names to
the attention of the student repre-
sentatives on the HonoraryDegree
Committee. This year the student
representatives are LSA senior
Carly Goldberg and Rackham stu-
dent Neal Rakesh.
Goldberg said she is very open
to hearing students' ideas for the
commencement speakers.
"I really encourage students to
contact me ..." Goldberg said. "I'm
sure there are a lot of people who
are really passionate about people
who should speak."
Goldberg started a Facebook
page titled "Who do you want for
Winter and Spring Commence-
ment Speaker?" on which people
can post ideas for who they want

to be the keynote speakers.
"It's pretty informal because
it's through social networking, but
I think it's one of the best ways to
reach people," Goldberg said.
In regard to the petition to have
Zuckerberg as the Spring Com-
mencement speaker, Goldbergsaid
she is glad people are starting peti-
tions for speakers, but is not too
familiar with Zuckerberg's back-
ground.
"I honestly don't know much
about him," Goldberg said. "I've
really only seen 'The Social Net-
work.' If students sign the petition,
I'd love to hear about how he con-
tributed to research, scholarship,
education or service."
Zuckerberg developed Facebook
in 2004 with some of his class-
mates while attending Harvard
University. The site later grew to
have 500 million users as of July
21, 2010. With a net worth of $6.9
billion reported in Forbes maga-
zine, Zuckerberg signed a promise
in 2010 to donate at least half of his
wealth to charity over time.
LSA senior Colette Cascarilla
said she would support Mark
Zuckerberg as a commencement
speaker.
"I think that would definitely
be entertaining," Cascarilla said.
"He's an entrepreneur so he'd have
good advice. There could definitely
be a lot worse picks, like last year.
I think it'd be something fresh and
fun. I'd be all for it."

Americans freed from
Iran prison head home

People hold signs as they gather on a street in Lower Manhattan Sunday, Sept. 11, 2011, during a rally by the American Freedom Defense
Initiative, which opposes the planned Islamic cultural center and mosque near ground zero. Earlier that Sunday there was a ceremony at
the National September 11 Memorial at the World Trade Center site for the 10th anniversary of the attacks on Sept.11, 2001.

Hikers spent two
years in custody,
released under
$1 million bail
MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -
After more than two years in
Iranian custody, two Ameri-
cans convicted as spies took
their firststeps toward home
today as they bounded down
from a private jet and into
the arms of family for a joy-
ful reunion in the Gulf state
of Oman.
The families called this
"the best day of our lives,"
and President Barack Obama
said their release - under a
$1 million bail-for-freedom
deal - "wonderful news."
The release capped com-
plicated diplomatic maneu-
vers over a week of confusing
signals by Iran's leadership
on the fate of Josh Fattal and
Shane Bauer.
Although the fate of the
two gripped America, it
was on the periphery of the
larger showdowns between
Washington and Tehran
that include Iran's nuclear
program and its ambitions
to widen military and politi-
cal influence in the Middle
East and beyond. But - for a
moment at least - U.S. offi-
cials maybe adding words of
thanks in addition to their
calls for alarm over Iran.
For Tehran, it was a
chance to court some good-
will after sending a message
of defiance with hard-line
justice in the July 2009
arrests of the Americans
along the Iran-Iraq bor-
der. The Americans always
maintained they were inno-
cent hikers.

"Today can only be
described as the best day
of our lives," said a state-
ment from their families.
"We have waited for nearly
26 months for this moment
and the joy and relief we feel
at Shane and Josh's long-
awaited freedom knows no
bounds."
"We now all want noth-
ing more than to wrap Shane
and Josh in our arms, catch
up on two lost years and
make a new beginning, for
them and for all of us," the
statement added.
Obama called it "wonder-
ful, wonderful news about
the hikers, we are thrilled ...
It's a wonderful day for them
and for us."
U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon welcomed the
hikers' release, saying he
"appreciates the decision
to respond to international
appeals on humanitarian
grounds," said spokesman
Martin Nesirky. "He com-
mends all parties who helped
to secure their release."
The release came on
the eve of Iranian Presi-
dent Mahmoud Ahmadine-
jad's previously scheduled
address Thursday to the
U.N. General Assembly's
annual ministerial meeting.
The families waited on
the tarmac at a royal airfield
near the main international
airport in Oman's capital,
Muscat. Also returning to
Oman was Sarah Shourd,
who was arrested with
Bauer and Fattal but freed
a year ago. She received a
marriage proposal from
Bauer while in prison.
At about 20 minutes before
midnight, Fattal and Bauer
- wearing jeans and casual
shirts - raced down the steps

from the blue-and-white
plane. They made no state-
ments to reporters before
walking into the airport ter-
minal building, which was
guarded by security officials.
The men appeared thin, but
in good health.
"We're so happy we are
free," Fattal told reporters
in Oman. The two men made
brief statements before leav-
ing the airport with their
families.
"Two years in prison is
too long," Bauer said, and
hoped their release from
prison will also bring "free-
dom for political prisoners
in America and Iran."
In many ways, the release
was a mirror image of the
scene last year when Shourd
was freed on $500,000 bail.
That deal, too, was medi-
ated by Oman, an Arabian
peninsula sultanate with
close ties to both Tehran and
Washington. A statement
from Oman said it hoped the
release would lead to better
ties between Iran and the U.S.
The gray metal gates of
Tehran's Evin prison finally
opened for Shourd - as it
did for her companions on 6
Wednesday - as Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahma-
dinejad was preparing for
the spotlight in New York at
the U.N.'s annual gathering
of world leaders last year. He
is scheduled to address the
world body again today.
Just a month ago, Bauer
and Fattal - both 29 - were
appealing their eight-year
prison terms for espionage
and illegal entry into Iran.
They denied the charges and
said they were merely hikers
in Iraq's relatively peaceful
Kurdistan region who wan-
dered close to Iran's border.

Center will have 9/11
memorial, be open
to all religions
NEW YORK (AP) - The developer
of an Islamic cultural center that
opened last night near the site of
the terrorist attacks that leveled the
World Trade Center says the biggest
error on the project was not involv-
ing the families of 9/11 victims from
the start.
People crowded into the center,
where a small orchestra played tra-
ditional Middle Eastern instruments
and a photo exhibit of New York chil-
dren of different ethnicities lined the
walls. The enthusiasm at the opening
belied its troubled beginnings.
"We made incredible mistakes,"
Sharif El-Gamal told The Associ-
ated Press in an earlier interview at

his Manhattan office.
The building at 51 Park Place, two
blocks from the World Trade Center
site, includes a Muslim prayer space
that has been open for two years.
El-Gamal said the overall center is
modeled after the Jewish Commu-
nity Center on Manhattan's Upper
West Side, where he lives.
"I wanted my daughter to learn
how to swim, so I took her to the
JCC," said the Brooklyn-born Mus-
lim. "And when I walked in, I said,
'Wow. This is great."'
The project has drawn criticism
from opponents who say they don't
want a mosque near the site of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The center is open to all faiths
and will include a 9/11 memorial,
El-Gamal said. He called opposition
to the center - which prompted one
of the most virulent national discus-
sions about Islam and freedom of

speech and religion since Sept. 11
- part of a "campaign against Mus-
lims."
Last year, street clashes in view of
the trade center site pitted support-
ers against opponents of the center.
When the center was first envi-
sioned several years ago, activist
Daisy Khan and her husband, Imam
Feisal Abdul Rauf, played a major,
vocal role. But they soon left the proj-
ect because of differences with the
developer.
El-Gamal, 38, confirmed yester-
day that they parted ways because
"we had a different vision." He
declined to elaborate.
The couple said they had dis-
cussed plans for Park51, as the cen-
ter is known, with relatives of 9/11
victims, first responders and oth-
ers, including the possibility that
it could become a multifaith center
focusing on religious conflict.

Roke kills 16, stops
commuter trains
in capital
TOKYO (AP) - A powerful
typhoon headed north today
after dumping heavy rains on
Japan's tsunami-devastated
coastline, paralyzing commuter
trains in the capital, and leav-
ing at least 16 people dead or
missing across the country.
There hadbeen concerns that
Typhoon Roke could pose more
problems for the Fukushima
Dai-ichi nuclear power plant,
which was sent into meltdown
by the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami, but officials said
the plant weathered the storm
without major incident.
Hiroki Kawamata, spokes-
man for plant operator Tokyo
Electric Power Co., said several
cameras set up to monitor the
plant were damaged, but there
had been no further leaks of
radioactive water or material
into the environment.
"We are seeing no problems
so far," he said.
The typhoon had reached
the country's northern island of
Hokkaido by Thursday morn-
ing after weakening overnight,
but there were no immediate
reports of damage there. The
storm was still packing sus-
tained winds of up to 78 mph
(126 kph).
The typhoon made landfall
Wednesday afternoon near the
city of Hamamatsu, about 125
miles (200 kilometers) west of
Tokyo, and then cut a path to
the northeast and through the
capital before bringing new
misery to the tsunami zone. It
dumped up to 17 inches (42 cen-
timeters) of rain in some areas,
triggering landslides and flood-
ing.
Police and local media
reported 16 people dead or
missing, most swept away by
rivers swollen with rains in the
southern and central regions.
One person died in a landslide
in northern Iwate prefecture

and two people were swept
away in Sendai in the northeast.
Hundreds of tsunami survi-
vors in government shelters in
the Miyagi state town of Ona-
gawa were forced to evacuate
for fear of flooding.
Strong winds snapped power
lines in many areas, and offi-
cials said more than 200,000
households in central Japan
were without electricity late
Wednesday.
Overnight in Tokyo, where
many rush hour trains were
suspended for hours, thousands
of commuters got stuck at sta-
tions across the sprawling city
and stood in long lines for buses
and cabs.
"The hotels in the vicinity are
all booked up, so I'm waiting
for the bullet train to restart,"
Hiromu Harada, a 60-year-old
businessman, said at Tokyo Sta-
tion.
Kyodo said 5,000 people
stayed overnight inside Shink-
ansen bullet trains at Tokyo and
Shizuoka stations.
Fire department officials
reported three people injured
in Tokyo. In the trendy shop-
ping district of Shibuya, winds
knocked a tree onto a sidewalk,
but no one was hurt. Pedestri-
ans struggled to walk straight
in powerful winds that made
umbrellas useless.
The storm had set off land-
slides in parts of Miyagi that
already were hit by the March
disasters. The local government
requested the help of defense
troops, and dozens of schools
canceled classes.
A magnitude-5.3 earthquake
struck late Wednesday just
south of Fukushima in Ibaraki
state. Officials said the temblor
posed no danger to the Fuku-
shima Dai-ichi plant, and that
it did not cause any damage or
injuries in the region.
Heavy rains prompted floods
and caused road damage earlier
in dozens of locations in Nagoya
and several other cities, the
Aichi prefectural government
said. More than 200 domestic
flights were canceled.

King leads young
squad into season

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
It's been six years since a
Michigan men's tennis team has
been void of seniors. The 2005
team ended its season ranked
No. 39 and was bounced in the
first round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment by No.25 Arkansas.
This year, the Wolverines
start the season just like they did
in 2005. But with junior Evan
King ranked No. 8 in the nation
and four other contributors in
last year's lineup returning as
sophomores, expectations are
higher than a first-round exit in
the NCAA Tournament.
As the team's No. 1 singles
player, King will lead the Wol-
verines. King started last season
unranked, but ended the year
ranked No.17 with 30 wins, bow-
ing out in the Sweet 16 and ended
earning All-American status.
King was the first Michigan
player to earn All-American sin-
gles status in19 years and had the
most singles wins of any Wolver-
ine since 1998.
This season, King is ranked
below three Big Ten foes.
In doubles, King was also a
force and won matches with
three different partners. Of his
three different partners from
last season, sophomores Shaun
Bernstein and Alex Buzzi are
returning. This season, King and
Bernstein are expected to play
doubles together and are seeded
No. 33.
Bernstein not only had oppor-
tunities to play No. 1 and No. 2
doubles throughout last season,
he also solidified a spot at No. 3
singles for most of the season and
was a key everyday contributor.
In several matches last year,
Bernstein found himself in
tough third sets, and at the
beginning of the season, Ber-
nstein was losing the decisive
set. But as the year progressed
and Bernstein found himself in
third sets more often, he began
to turn the tables on his oppo-
nent and win the elusive third
sets.
For Michigan to be success-
ful, Bernstein will have to set an
example for the incoming fresh-
men about how to condition,
what kind of attitude to have on

the court, and even how to man-
age study time and diets.
Michigan also welcomes
three freshmen to its roster for
the 2011 season-Eli Brown,
Alex Petrone, and Michael Zhu.
Brown was ranked in the top
five of his junior class in Canada.
Michigan coach Bruce Ber-
que said Brown is highly moti-
vated to improve, transition
to college tennis in the United
States, and find a spot in the
lineup by the time scoring
events start in January.
Petrone, a blue-chip recruit
from New York, possesses natu-
ral shot-making skills from the
baseline that will make him
competitive in Michigan's line-
up almost immediately. Zhu also
brings excellent baseline skills
to the Wolverines. As someone
who aspires to play professional
tennis, Berque mentioned that
Zhu knows he has a lot of work
to do to reach his ultimate goal.
"We are going to have to have
at least one freshman in singles
and doubles lineups," Berque
said. "For us to be strong, these
freshmen are going to have to
be quick studies and get in the
lineup right away and improve a
lot between now and then."
Because the Wolverines have
just five returning players, at
least one of the incoming fresh-
men will have to do more than
make appearances in the lineup.
"I definitely think it's likely
that these guys will crack the
top five (in the lineup)," Ber-
que said. "We've got a lot of
guys that are pretty even on our
team. Evan has obviously estab-
lished himself as our top player,
but after that there isn't a whole
lot that would surprise me." .
Entering last season, Michi-
gan's roster of nine consisted
of three freshmen. So, it wasn't
necessary for freshmen to play
in every match. But this year,
the Wolverines only have eight
players on the roster, opening a
spot for at least one freshman to
play in every match.
The Wolverines start their
fall season this weekend, with
an appearance in the Harvard
Chowder Fall Classic. The tour-
nament field includes defending
champion USC and highly tout-
ed Texas A&M.

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson and the Michigan offense haven't recorded a single first-quarter point this season.
M'looks to couneatslow starts

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
In the Michigan football
team's first three games, it's been
getting out of the gates as fast as
Seabiscuit - N
in the horse's NOTEBOOK
present state.
And the Wolverines' opponents
aren't reluctant to beat a dead
horse.
Michigan has been outscored
21-0 in the first quarter this sea-
son. And Eastern Michigan, the
only team who didn't score in the
opening period, scored its only
points of the game in the first play
of the second quarter.
The Wolverines' defense has
given up a first-drive touchdown
in two of the first three games.
The offense has gained just 129
yards on 34 plays in the first
quarter.
"I don't know if there's a magic
answer for that," Michigan coach

Brady Hoke said.
But fifth-year senior wide
receiver Junior Hemingway
thinks he does. According to
senior defensive tackle Mike
Martin, Hemingway pointed out
in senior meetings that the team
always has their worst practice of
the week on Tuesdays, their first
day back from the weekend. Each
practice gets better as the game
goes on, mirroring their perfor-
mance on game days.
"I think it's really just a mental
thing," Martin said. "I think that
we need better leadership and I'll
put that on myself as a senior, as
captain. We need to get the guys
ready to go for the first snap of
the game.
"Maybe that's on me to make
sure I'm a little bit more intense
and ready to go and produce on
the field a bit better."
TRENDING BUT NOT TRENDY:
To 25,161 people, junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson is also

known as Denard X.
Robinson entered the Twit-
ter world with the handle of
@DenardX. The account gained
thousands of followers in the first
hours of its existence, partly due
to his teammates' heavy promo-
tion.
His first tweet actually came
from redshirt sophomore line-
backer Cam Gordon: "This Cam
and lace don't know what to
tweet."
After a week and a half, not
much has changed.
"Oh my god," Robinson said,
smiling. "I don't even know how
to tweet. I'm trying to learn. I just
made it. I don't know."
SPECIAL FEATS FOR SPECIAL
TEAMS: Redshirt sophomore
kicker Brendan Gibbons is han-
dling shorter field goals. Fresh-
man Matt Wile handles the
longer ones and is seen as the
deep threat. And he's willing to
go deeper.

He said he hit a 59-yard field
goal in practice. When asked,
Hoke said he would let Wile try
it in a game. Finding the oppor-
tunity may be the problem. Only
one team (Boise State) has yet to
attempt a field goal this season.
Michigan is one of seven teams to
attempt only one.
On the other side, redshirt
sophomore Jeremy Gallon may
be pulling double-duty after his
approximately 80-yard punt
return against Eastern Michi-
gan was called back because of a
block in the back. Hoke said Mon-
day that Gallon may both return
punts and kickoffs.
INJURY NOTE: Hoke said that
both Gordon andfifth-yearsenior
linebacker Brandon Herron will
be available to play against San
Diego State but clarified that he
didn't think they would start,
partly because of conditioning
and partly because of the play of
redshirt freshman Jake Ryan.

Stadium gives Blue
added confidence

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Playing at home has its advan-
tages - there's no travel, and
players are afforded the comfort
ofsleepingin their own beds and
eating home-cooked meals.
But for the Michigan women's
soccer team (6-2-1), competing
in Ann Arbor also means playing
in the Michigan Soccer Stadium:
a new venue with an inspiration-
al and vibrant atmosphere.
"The new stadium has been a
really great addition for us and
we all love it," senior defender
Kristen Goncalves said. "It does
provide a fun and energetic
atmosphere for us to play in. We
have so many more fans at home
and they're so great and ener-
getic."
Since the erection of the U-M
Soccer Complex a little more
than a year ago, the Wolverines
are 10-2-3 playing on their home
field, outscoring opponents
31-12.
Some might attribute their
home success to the extra rest
time they are provided by not
having to travel and an improved
roster in recent seasons. But
Goncalves believes that their
recent dominance at home can
be credited to their new stadium,
which provides them with extra
motivation and encouragement
when they step into the locker
room and head out onto the field.
In her freshman season,
Michigan played its "home"
games in three different loca-
tions. While the new soccer
stadium was being built, the

Wolverines played just two
home games in Ann Arbor while
the rest of its home games were
split between Ypsilanti and
Plymouth, Mich. She remembers
the unfamiliarity she felt play-
ing her home games on a field
covered with Eastern Michigan
signs.
It "just didn't feel like home,"
she said.
In the subsequent season,
Goncalves and her teammates
were lucky enough to play all of
their home games in Ann Arbor.
But while they had the fortune
of playing their home games on
campus, the new stadium still
hadn't been built yet, so they
played their home games with-
out the confines of a stadium.
Their home-field advantage was
mitigated by playing on a basic
soccer field with only a tiny sec-
tion of bleachers - seats that
were barely filled for games.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
- who was also in his first year
when the Wolverines played
their home games in Ypsilanti
and Plymotuh - insists that
Michigan suffered immensely
from not having a place to call
home.
The extended traveling and
the lack of adequate facilities
took a toll on Michigan. In his
first two years, the Wolverines
posted a mediocre 7-5-5 record
in their home games, barely out-
scoring their opponents 27-22
duringthat two-year period.
"It's really nice to play at
home," Goncalves said. "I don't
know if it helps us win, but it def-
initely makes ita lot more fun."

Van Bergen, defensive line adjust to new scheme


Fifth-year senior
says Hoke and Co.
have lofty aims for
defensive line
STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Ryan Van Bergen plays in
a constant state of limbo. The
fifth-year senior's position on
the Michigan football team's
defensive line doesn't just fluc-
tuate - it's a heads-or-tails mat-
ter.
"We actually have a little coin
that we flip to figure out if I'm
playing inside (or outside)," Van
Bergen joked.
After Van Bergen spent three
seasons at defensive end, Michi-
gan defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison decided to shift him a
spot over to play tackle alongside
senior defensive tackle Mike
Martin.
But Van Bergen has continued
to transition between both spots
on the defensive line.
He just likes to be in the spot
with the fiercest action. If the
opposing team is running inside,
he wants to playtackle. If there's
a pass rush, he wants to come off
the edge.
But the coaches have a differ-
ent plan for the seasoned line-
man.
"They like me against double
teams, so wherever the double
team's going, that's where I'll
probably be," Van Bergen said.
For Van Bergen, double teams
are just double the challenge. He
welcomes them.
"It's probably not the most
glorious spot," Van Bergen said.
"No one's going to say, 'Wow,

he took on some great double
teams.' That's not really some-
thing that's going to happen. But
I take it as a point of pride."
Van Bergen has collected nine
tackles in three games, but his
presence on the line is consis-
tently felt by both his unit and
the opposing offense.
Teammates like redshirt
junior linebacker Kenny Demens
and junior linebacker Brandin
Hawthorne can attest to the Van
Bergen effect.
"They tell me, 'I like having
you in front of me,' " Van Bergen
said. "They know I'll take on two
blocks and they'll be free to run
and make a play or two. I take a
lot of pride in the fact that I'm
going to take on two guys and
I'm not going backward."
"It's time to
start arriving
as a defensive
unit."
On the backs of the seniors,
Van Bergen thinks the entire
mindset of the front seven has
changed - and changed for
good.
"The standard for defensive
line at Michigan is going to be
the highest in the country, at
some point," Van Bergen said. "I
think it is right now, as far as in
(Michigan coach Brady Hoke's)
mind, but we're definitely not
playing up to that standard up
front, myself included."
The defensive line got its first
sack of the season last Saturday
when junior defensive end Craig

a

ED MOCH /Daily
Fifth-year senior defensive tackle Ryan Van Bergen (53) has collected nine tackles through three games this season, switching from defensive end to tackle.

Roh caught Eastern Michigan
quarterback Alex Gillett in the
backfield.
"Michigan traditionally has
had a dominant defensive line
and dominant linebacker corps,"
Van Bergen said. "We have to set
ourselves to the standard that
they have and we have to play
better - bottom line.
"It's coming up on crunch
time. If you're not where you
need to be, the season's here and
it's time to start arriving as a
defensive unit."
The Wolverines will face a

formidable test this weekend
in the form of San Diego State
and running back Ronnie Hill-
man, the nation's second-leading
rusher.
Hillman has rushed for 497
yards and eight touchdowns in
just three games this season.
Michigan has struggled
defensively against the run,
especially early in games.
"There's no way to hide it,"
Van Bergen said.
In first quarters, opposing
backs have rushed for an average
of 5.31 yards per carry. In com-

parison, fourth-quarter num-
bers less than half of that, at 2.65
yards per carry.
When asked what area needed
to improve substantially before
Big Ten play, Hoke instinctively
pointed to the front seven - the
defensive line and linebackers.
The defensive front has fall-
en on plenty of hard times. But
other times - with its backs to
the goal line - it has been nearly
impenetrable. Thanks to Mat-
tison's well-disguised schemes,
the defense has allowed just
four red-zone touchdowns in 10

opportunities.
There's nothing heads or tails
about it, Michigan's defense is
stout at the goal line.
In the defense's meeting
room, there's a sign affixed to
the wall, reading, "Give me a
place to stand."
"That really means that until
that ball crosses that goal line,
as long as I havea place to stand,
they aren't in yet," Mattison
said. "Our guys believe in that."
Even if it's by just a few blades
of grass, they haven't run out of
space yet.

Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
MINT CHOCOLATE
CHIP ICE CREAM

BEN & JERRY'S
304 South State
Though Ben & Jerry's ice creams
more often tend to be overly sweet, this
variation found a balance between cool,
refreshing mint and not being toothpaste.
It was the only one to stick to the natural
color oftmint ice cream: white. The choco-
late chunks required two bites and a nice
break in flavorbutultimately were too few
and far between.
WASHTENAW DAIRY
602 South Ashley
Creamy without being heavy, minty
without becoming toothpaste, Washt-
enaw Dairy's take on mint chocolate chip
should be the standard by which to mea-
sure all others. The pale green delight
hits that precise golden ratio of chips to
ice cream, resulting ina smooth marriage
of the two namesake flavors - a winning,
delicious proportion.

STUCCHI'S
1121 South University
The Stucchi's rendition ofmint chocolate
chip is underwhelming. The ice cream hits
your tongue without a burst ofmintyflavor.
You wait, hoping for a wave ofttasty happi-
ness to take your by surprise, but it never
comes. You chew the bits oftchocolate to try
and sooth our disappointed taste buds, but
the watery ice cream cannot be forgotten.
Pass on the mint, get chocolate instead.
ZINGERMAN'S CREAMERY
3723 Plaza Drive
OK, we know it's really gelato. But no
dessert competition is complete without
a trip to Kerrytown's coolest creamery ...
right? Wrong. The Zingerman's mint choc-
olate chip gelato tastes like icy Crest on a
spoon. Sure, the chips are a delectable choc-
olate surprise, and the cream's consistency
is dialed right up to "melt-in-your-mouth."
But a mint that intense can't wina war.

{(B-side Buzzi
Joseph Wojtowicz
LSA senior
Reference Assistant at Hatcher Graduate Library
Are you a fan of jazz music?
I really like Sun Ra and Cecil Taylor. Big Pharoah Sanders fan -
the list goes on.
What's your favorite ice cream place?
What's the name of that place that's on First and Ashley? They have
donuts there too, and they sell beer there, and it's like a creamery? I
can't remember what it's called now. (Washtenaw Dairy)
If you could invent an ice cream flavor, what would it be?
That's a really hard question. My favorite's Superman. I don't really
know how you can improve on that, so it's hard to imagine any-
thing better.

'GETZ/GILBERTO' (1964), VERVE

The Christmas wishes
of a true gossipgirl

COURTESY OF AMC
An example of the Japanese aesthetic shibumi, a Rothko painting hangs in Bert Cooper's office in the TV show "Mad Men."

Getz and Gilberto
epitomize bygone
sophistication
By JOE CADAGIN
DailyFineArtsEditor
"Less is more" goes the
maxim, and nowhere has this
concept been better understood
than in Japan. The Japanese
value an aesthetic called shibu-
mi, which has no equivalent in
English. The word refers to the
understated elegance that per-
vades in the art and architecture
of the island nation: the simple
beauty of a ceramic tea bowl,
or the quiet sophistication of a
stone lantern.
Shibumi may be the best way
to describe the 1964 Grammy-
winning masterpiece Getz/
Gilberto. The album's eight
songs, which include the iconic
"The Girl from Ipanema" and
"Corcovado," are a fusion of two
musical worlds. The legendary
collaboration between Ameri-
can jazz saxophonist Stan Getz
and Brazilian musicians Joo
Gilberto and Antonio Carlos
Jobim produced a work of sexy
simplicity that epitomizes the
PHOTOGRAPHY
From Page 1B
Last semester, LSA junior
Katie Gass collaborated with fel-
low RC creative writing student
Logan Corey to create a multi-
media exhibit combining poetry
and photography as a platform to
showcase gender and sexuality
in the modern world. The final
exhibit consisted of one 16x20
black-and-white and four 8x11
photos, three poems and sev-
eral three-dimensional objects.
Gass's experiences in the dark-
room and Michael's mentorship
have beentouchstone parts of her
growth as an artist.
"Working in the darkroom is
my escape from the real world;
whether it is the nerve-wracking
moments of developing negatives
or the rhythmic process of print-
ing photographs," Gass wrote in
an e-mail interview. "It is always
a worthwhile experience and one
that I hope others will continue
to have in the years to come."
She added, "Digital photogra-
phy may be getting more atten-
tion these days, but Photoshop is
really no substitute for the magic
of the darkroom. One moment
all you have is a negative and a
blank sheet of paper, and within
five minutes you've captured an
unforgettable moment in time."
Practicality also factors into
the decision to stick with film
- namely, the large expense of
a digital photo lab. According
to Hannum, it's actually much
cheaper to use a traditional 4x5
film view camera once one gets
into larger formats. It's still very
expensive for digital cameras
to replicate the high-resolution
quality of large-scale film prints.
While one tool is no better or
worse than another, Hannum
emphasized how film forces the
photographer to slow down and
really think about the image at
hand, instead of snapping a hun-
dred pictures and choosing the

best one.
"In a way it reminds me of the
Slow Food movement," he said.
"It slows you up a bit."
By experiencing the medium
from a different vantage point,
students only enhance their abil-

shibumi aesthetic, which hap-
pens to be making a comeback in
today's style.
Composer/pianist Jobim and
singer/guitarist Gilberto were
the pioneers of the Brazilian
bossa nova style that developed
in the late '50s and early '60s.
Portuguese for "new trend,"
bossa nova is a more subdued,
percussion-less take on the tra-
ditional Afro-Brazilian samba.
Casual and unobtrusive melo-
dies and gentle rhythm give
bossa nova its cool, relaxed feel-
ing - like a stroll down a sandy
beach in Rio.
Bossa nova struck a chord
with American listeners when it
reached the U.S. in the early'60s.
It was therefore no surprise that
when saxophonist Getz - who
had already experimented with
Brazilian music on his album
Jazz Samba - teamed up with
Gilberto and Jobim, their work
became one of jazz's best-selling
albums.
Performing Jobim's songs is
the soft-voiced Gilberto, who
also strums along on the guitar.
Getz's saxophone improvisa-
tions on Jobim's pieces reveal
the entire scope of rhythmic and
melodic possibilities contained
in the ostensibly simple melo-
ities with the methods they've
already learned and practiced.
Yet there is indeed a craft to
digital photography, Hannum
said - one just as viable as film.
The big question again comes
back to money: How does one
practice the craft and move into
large-scale prints without usinga
$50,000 digital camera?
Lending further credence to
his personal belief of all tools
being equal, Hannum explained
how he introduces students to
a "smorgasbord" of tools and
options. He leaves room for lots
of freedom and exploration, espe-
cially for students who undertake
an independent study, the next
step after Hannum's 385 course.
Upon gaining greater familiarity
with cameras, his students' inde-
pendent projects may use even
more diverse tools.
"We had someone do an inde-
pendent study with an iPhone
where she documented a party,"
he said. "There's a certain sense
of vitality one gets with an
iPhone. (The iPhone) is much
more appropriate for such an
event than a large 4x5 camera.
It's just a tool and you have to use
it in the way that's appropriate
for the job at hand."
At the end of the day, it comes
back to perspective. To be famil-
iar with the wide range of tools at
one's disposal is to know the cor-
rect time and place for each tool.
Sometimes it may be an iPhone,
and at other times it's a black-
and-white viewfinder. Both are
fine by Hannum. He just wants
people to know what else is out
there.
Because of this philosophy,
it would be a mistake to classify
Hannum as someone clinging to
old technologies. For him, devel-
oping prints in the darkroom is
simply a good way to learn how
to choose what to use and what
to photograph. It enhances the
overall liberal arts experience.
"This is what universities do.
We teach students what's hap-

pened and what's available and
how to deal with the problems at
hand,"he said. "I think inthe past
50 years, the art community has
moved away from craft and more
toward conceptual art, which is
OK. But some people just want to

dies - the range of complexity
beneath the shibumi.
Joining the team on the
album's two hit singles was Gil-
berto's wife at the time, singer
Astrud Gilberto, who sang the
English translations of "Girl
from Ipanema" and "Corcova-
do." One line from the latter is a
perfect lyrical representation of
the unobtrusive beauty of shibu-
mi: "Quiet nights of quiet stars
/ Quiet chords from my guitar /
Floating on the silence that sur-
rounds us."
Astrud's sensuous voice with
its "exotic" Brazilian accent
typified the sophistication of
the '60s. Yet until very recently,
the stylish and classy early years
of the decade went overlooked.
Any mention of the '60s conjures
images of psychedelic drugs,
hippies, rock'n'roll and Wood-
stock. But this sort of youth
counterculture that emerged
in the late '60s had little to do
with the more adult "Mad Men"
era, as the early '60s have come
to be called. In fact, AMC's hit
TV show is largely responsible
for rekindling America's recent
interest in the more mature
modernist chic of the period.
As depicted in "Mad Men,"
See MOD, Page 4B
buckle down and learn how to do
something well."
Leaving the past in the dark
Similar to Hannum's courses,
the School of Art & Design also
pushes its students to incorpo-
rate many facets into their art.
The main difference is a heavy
multimedia approach, as opposed
to an emphasis on historical pro-
cesses.
Within the School of Art &
Design, there are mandatory
classes for all freshmen and soph-
omores. The first required class
in the curriculum is TMP (Tools,
Materials, Processes), where stu-
dents learn fundamental skills in
a variety of mediums, including
photography and printmaking.
As students progress through
their four years in the program,
they have the opportunity to spe-
cialize. But according to Rebekah
Modrak, an associate professor
in the School of Art & Design,
traditional disciplines such as
photography were eliminated a
couple of years ago to mirror the
increasing fluidity in the arts.
In short, students don't major
in photography, but motivated
students can work within the
school's broad curriculum to
discover their passion and build
concentrations based on interest.
For Max Collins, an Art & Design
alum and former managingphoto
editor of The Michigan Daily, the
program not only allowed him to
do photography but also taught
him to apply it to other classes -
an idea reminiscent of Hannum's
own convictions.
"If you were to look at my
transcript, you would see very
few classes that were solely pho-
tography, but that is just how the
School of Art & Design is set up,"
Collins wrote in an e-mail inter-
view. "The classes offered often
have these very broad parame-
ters, which allows for students to
work in a variety of mediums. So
while I wasn't taking traditional

photo courses, I was able to use
photography in a majority of my
classes."
Collins's senior thesis stands as
a strong model of a project using
photography as a pivot-point for
a greater piece of media. He shot

say my Christmas wish did come
true, albeit a little late: Reese

fer finally has a boyfriend! She's
been dating the very rebellious-
looking writer-actor Justin
Theroux since May.
But looking back on my
Christmas wishes, it got me
thinking: Why did I wish for
the happiness of people I don't
even know? Wouldn't it have
been more practical to wish for
the happiness of, say, my sister
as she finishes her senior year
in college? Or widespread peace
in the Middle East? Why did I
want to see Jennifer Aniston
happy?
This got me thinking about
the role celebrities play in my
world. To me, these aren't just
average people living their lives.
These are people playing out
a story for me - the highs and
lows of their lives are chronicled
in every magazine I read and
in every re-tweet I post. They
become the people I root for
(Demi Lovato's struggle with
bipolar disorder) and the villains
I despise (ugh, Charlie Sheen).
When I first heard that Kim
Kardashian was getting married,
I cheered just as loudly as if I
found out my cousin was going

give them a zombie look.
"The general concept had to do
with how we behave with digital
technology and I chose to exem-
plify this through the glazed
expressions we have when we
work on computers," Collins
wrote.
Even though the school may
not offer an abundant array of
strictly technical classes, the
School of Art & Design's fine art
basis aims to get students think-
ing about the ways in which they
might employ their craft. Accord-
ing to Collins, such a curricu-
lum is ahead of traditional trade
schools where students might
solely study photography.
"Today, everyone with a cam-
era is a photographer," Collins
wrote. "Now the battle isn't in
making the image anymore; it's
about how you can differentiate
yourself from the pack creatively."
Of course, the school needs to
prepare its students for the real
world, where they must be famil-
iar with the entire array of artis-
tic practices currently in use.
However, the essential need to
understand the past has recently
reemerged to go hand-in-hand

with its current multimedia
approach.
Modrak recently published
"Reframing Photography," a
text geared toward photogra-
phers and non-photographers
alike. The primary impetus for
the book, as she explained, was
a desire to ground today's wide
spectrum of photographic prac-
tices in history and technique.
She advocates this type of study
despite her affinity for social net-
working sites like Facebook and
Flickr. Though the use of tech-
nology is not a bad thing, it does
alter the landscape.
"In many ways, Facebook is the
end result of what we're going to
make with a photo," Modrak said.
"We think about social network-
ing and online Internet art when
making photos, so Facebook must
be in your mind all the time with
what you're going to consider."

A TASTE OF ITAY
Digging into gelato's creation and past

How local joints
continue the
delicious tradition
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
There's a scene in "Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Fac-
tory" when Willy Wonka walks
into the Inventing Room in his fac-
tory. Walking into the backroom at
Zingerman's Creamery is kind of
like that, with coiled hoses, metal
machines that gurgle and hiss and
large freezers that exude steam
and frost. But it's a small, unas-
suming, box-shaped machine in
a corner that is the source of con-
fectionery delight at the creamery
- gelato.
As an Italian dessert, gelato has
a long history, dating back to the
days of the Roman Empire when it
was a luxury item for the wealthy.
In those days, the well-to-do Ital-
ians would send their slaves upthe

mountains to get ice for the frozen
treat. But now, the process moves
quickly and is much easier thanks
to modern technology.
According to Josh Miner, a
gelato maker at Zingerman's
Creamery, there are two main
steps in creating gelato. The first is
to make the base by mixing milk,
cream and sugar together, heating
the batch up and then freezing itas
fast as possible. The most impor-
tant and most demanding step is
making sure the mix has the cor-
rect percentages of fat, sugar and
air - the proportion of fat in the
base helps differentiate it from ice
cream.
"The way the base mix is done
will have alarge effectontasteand
texture," Miner said.
Once the base isset, Miner said,
the remaining bit is easy. The mix
is poured into the batch freezer
(that small machine in the corner),
flavoring is added and the result-
ing gelato is churned and frozen
slowly.
"There are only four buttons

on the machine. (At this point) it's
really hard to screw up," Miner
said.
Still, a lot of work goes into the
process, and it can't be done care-
lessly. It's the opposite - making
gelato requires a certain skill set.
"You have to approach gelato
with some curiosity ... if it's not
creative, it's not worth doing,
Miner said.
Additionally, painstaking mea-
surements are necessary to create
even the most basic flavors. The
base mix changes in relation to
each flavor's fat and sugar content
- strawberry has a lot of sugar and
no fat, but hazelnut is all fat and no
sugar.
"You need to make the right
adjustments in order to keep the
texture and the flavor right,"
Miner said.
Balancingthe taste to create the
ideal flavor is another challenging
part of the process. For example, Zingerman's gelato maker Josh Miner isp

almonds and chocolate - should
be obvious.
"You don't have to be an expert,
you're not swilling wine around
or cleansing the palate, but having
the right mindset and concentrat-
ing is important," Lemmer said.
Without really thinking about
what you're putting into your
mouth, it would be easy to over-
look the delicacies in gelato, like
the fizz in Champagne Rose or the
difference between a light milk
chocolate and a sinfully rich Bel-
gian chocolate. The subtle varia-
tions in flavor make tasting more
interesting.
"Our flavors are changing con-
stantly," Lemmer said. "You can
really make anything with gelato.
Ice cream is much more limited in
that way - you have your choco-
lates, your vanillas and you can
really only do so much with it....
(With gelato) you have to be will-
ing to try different things and
understand that it's special."
Furthermore, the flavor of gela-
to varies with each batch since it is
produced on a much smaller scale.
Some flavors can never he renli-

cated.
Yogobliss on South University
Avenue also carries gelato, pur-
chased from Palazzolo's, a gelato
company in Fennville, Mich. that
makes over 600 flavors. Though
the flavors Yogobliss carries are
more traditional, the makers
certainly understand versatility.
Taste is relative and not everyone
is daring enough to taste a salmon
or garlic flavored dessert.
"Lots of people haven't actually
tried gelato unless they're from
a huge city," said Catharine Rob-
inson, an LSA sophomore and a
manager of Yogobliss.
Since gelato is fairly new to the
area, Yogobliss wants to introduce
people to it slowly.
"I was a new student here last
year and for me, Ann Arbor is all
about new experiences and gelato
is kind of one of them," Robinson
said.
of course, there are endless
culinary possibilities with the des-
sert.
"It's all about what you can
dream up," Lemmer said. "The
freezer is vour canvas."

Gelato is served in a small cup with a tiny spoon because the taste is so rich,

shibumi was a dominant feature
in the look and feel of the early
'60s. The bichromatic or trichro-
matic paintings of Mark Rothko
- one of which adorns the wall 4
of Bert Cooper's office in "Mad
Men" - and the steel-and-glass
skyscrapers of Ludwig Mies
van der Rohe capture the unas-
suming appeal of the shibumi
aesthetic. In fact, Mies van der
Rohe was famous for embracing
the mantra "less is more" in his
approach to architecture.
This philosophy has been
absorbed into the fashions of
today and explains the resurg-
ing popularity of trim suits,
slim-fitting cocktail dresses and
well-groomed hairstyles. Even
the demand for IKEA's stream-
lined minimalist furniture has
something to do with the shibu-
mi renaissance.
Getz/Gilberto, then, is the 4
perfect musical expression of
this style. The album is the
antithesis of the loud and crazy
rock of The Beatles, with a

of American jazz and Brazil-
ian bossa nova created softer,
quieter and more stylish music
- something you could sip a
cocktail to.
