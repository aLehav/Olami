The 2019 novel coronavirus 
(COVID-19) 
has 
spread 
to 
countries around the world 
and across the United States 
since 
its 
identification 
in 
Wuhan, China last December. 
Yesterday, two cases of COVID-
19 
were 
confirmed 
in 
the 
state of Michigan, and Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer declared a 
state of emergency. One of the 
two patients with COVID-19 
in Michigan is an inpatient at 
Michigan Medicine. 
University President Mark 
Schlissel announced Wednesday 
that all classes, beginning on 
Monday, will be moved online. 
Classes for Thursday and Friday 
were canceled. Study abroad 
programs for spring were also 
discontinued. In the days prior 
to the announcement, students, 
faculty and staff waited for 
updates, sometimes frustrated 
by a lack of information.
Emily Toth Martin, associate 
professor of epidemiology at the 
School of Public Health who 
studies 
virus 
epidemiology, 
said COVID-19 will likely not 
affect a majority of people who 
contract it. 

The University of Michigan 
announced on Wednesday all 
classes on all three campuses 
will be held online beginning 
March 16 through the end of the 
semester, April 21, in response 
to the COVID-19 virus. Classes 

on Thursday and Friday will be 
canceled. However, the University 
will remain open, including dorms 
and dining halls.
In a statement shared on 
Twitter, 
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel wrote the changes 
are meant to maximize the safety 
of the campus communities.
“To protect the health and 
safety 
of 
our 
communities 
and minimize the spread of 

#COVID19, @UMich is making 
changes to classes, travel, study 
abroad and large events on our 
Ann Arbor, @UM_Dearborn and 
@UMFlint campuses,” Schlissel 
wrote.
Events expected to attract 
more than 100 people will also 
be canceled, including Honors 
Convocation. According to the 
statement, updates about plans 
for 
commencement 
will 
be 

provided when more information 
is available.
On-campus sporting events will 
be limited to parents and members 
of the press.
The statement noted all spring 
study abroad programs through 
the University will be canceled 
or altered, given the severity of 
the outbreak. All other University 
international travel will also be 
suspended, except under rare 

circumstances requiring approval. 
Programs starting July 1 or later 
will be evaluated over the coming 
weeks.
The World Health Organization 
declared the COVID-19 outbreak 
a global pandemic Wednesday 
afternoon as the virus continues 
to spread globally.
The move to online classes 
comes a day after Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer signed an executive order 

declaring a state of emergency 
following the diagnosis of the first 
two cases of the COVID-19 virus 
in Michigan.
In a press conference Tuesday 
evening, 
Whitmer 
said 
she 
declared the state of emergency 
to maximize efforts and to assist 
local governments and officials in 
slowing the spread of COVID-19.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

One of the two people 
confirmed to have COVID-
19 in the state of Michigan 
by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
Tuesday night is an inpatient 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
according to an update from 
Michigan Medicine.
Whitmer declared a state of 
emergency Tuesday evening in 

a press conference. According 
to Whitmer, one individual 
is a woman from Oakland 
County 
who 
has 
recently 
traveled internationally, while 
the other is a man in Wayne 
County who has a recent 
history of domestic travel. 
Both are middle-aged. 
Michigan 
Medicine 
CEO Marschall Runge said 
Michigan Medicine had been 
anticipating treating cases of 
COVID-19 if they occurred.
“For 
weeks, 
Michigan 
Medicine teams have been 

preparing to care for patients 
infected 
with 
COVID-19 
if the need arises,” Runge 
wrote. “Our teams will take 
all necessary precautions to 
triage patients appropriately 
and prevent the spread of the 
virus.” 
In an email to The Daily, 
Mary 
Masson, 
Michigan 
Medicine director of public 
relations, wrote that she cannot 
share any further information 
to protect the patient’s privacy, 
but noted Michigan Medicine is 
confident it has minimized the 

risk of exposure for employees 
and visitors.
According to the statement, 
the patient has been isolated 
and the necessary precautions 
are being taken. The patient is 
in stable condition.
“We are confident that we 
have used proper precautions 
with this patient who was 
carefully isolated to minimize 
the risk of exposure to our 
employees and patients,” the 
statement reads.

2 DAYS OFF, COURSES MOVED ONLINE AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAK


PAULINE RAJSKI/Daily 
The University of Michigan club rowing team raises money for Mott’s Children’s Hospital on the Diag Wednesday afternoon.

What 
is 
coronavirus? 
Where did it start?
COVID-19 
is 
the 
most 
recently 
discovered 
strain 
of coronavirus. It was first 
identified 
in 
humans 
in 
Wuhan, China in December of 
2019. Coronaviruses, a large 
family of zoonotic viruses, 
cause infections that span a 
wide spectrum of severity, 
from common colds to more 
severe respiratory diseases. 
Older 
populations 
or 
people with existing medical 
problems are most at risk 
for serious infections. The 
most common symptoms of 
COVID-19 are fever, tiredness 
and dry cough, however, other 
flu-like symptoms can occur 
and in extreme cases, patients 
experience 
respiratory 
complications 
and 
trouble 
breathing. Most people can 
recover from a COVID-19 
infection 
without 
intense 
treatment. 
How 
can 
I 
avoid 
contracting coronavirus?
COVID-19 spreads via small 
droplets 
from 
the 
mouth 
and nose that are circulated 
through the air when infected 
people 
breathe 
or 
cough. 
When 
an 
infected 
person 
coughs or exhales the droplets 
can be inhaled by individuals 
within a three-foot radius. 
People 
can 
also 
become 
infected 
by 
coming 
into 
contact with surfaces — such 
as doorknobs and railings — 
that droplets land on and then 
touching their mouth, nose or 
eyes. The risk for contracting 
COVID-19 can be lowered by 

taking precautions including 
washing 
hands 
frequently, 
avoiding contact with your 
face, practicing responsible 
respiratory hygiene, staying 
home when sick and avoiding 
others who are sick.
Is the virus in Michigan? 
On March 10, two cases of 
COVID-19 were confirmed in 
the state of Michigan and Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer declared a 
state of emergency. Testing 
for COVID-19 is occurring 
at the state level for patients 
who are exhibiting strong 
symptoms of the virus and 
with likely exposure due to 
travel history.
Who should be worried 
about coronavirus?
COVID-19 
infections 
in 
children and young adults 
are generally mild. It can 
cause 
serious 
illness 
in 
some cases, with about one-
fifth 
of 
infected 
people 
requiring hospital care. The 
demographics most at risk for 
contracting a serious infection 
as a result of COVID-19 are 
elderly people and those who 
have 
underlying 
medical 
conditions such as high blood 
pressure, diabetes or heart 
problems. 
What should I do if I feel 
sick?
Individuals 
experiencing 
cough, 
fever 
or 
difficulty 
breathing should seek medical 
attention. People who feel 
sick with other symptoms 
should stay home from classes 
or work to decrease the risk 
of spreading any infection 
to others. If you feel sick 
it is best to practice self-
isolation or social distancing 
and avoid public areas and 
transportation, 
minimizing 

contact with other people, 
wearing a facemask when 
around 
others 
to 
avoid 
spreading 
droplets 
and 
practicing good hygiene such 
as frequent hand washing and 
cleaning high-touch surfaces. 
What 
resources 
are 
available on campus right 
now?
As 
during 
a 
normal 
school 
year, 
Counseling 
and Psychological Services, 
housed in the Union, will 
continue to provide counseling 
and support to students. The 
English Language Institute 
and International Institute 
will work with international 
students to develop a plan 
for the rest of the semester 
if needed. University Health 
Service 
will 
continue 
providing care to students. 
But if you feel sick, stay home 
and call UHS or your primary 
care physician. 
What is the difference 
between social distancing, 
isolation and quarantine?
According 
to 
Joseph 
Eisenberg, 
chair 
and 
professor 
of 
epidemiology, 
“isolation is being three to six 
feet away from people so that 
particles being emitted won’t 
reach you. Quarantine means 
being alone and not in contact 
with people. Isolation is more 
about an ill patient being kept 
away from the population.” 
Social 
distancing, 
on 
the 
other hand, refers to making 
a concerted effort to stay 
away from others to lower the 
possibility of contracting the 
virus. Eisenberg said all three 
efforts are beneficial. “All 
measures help slow the spread 
of the disease,” Eisenberg 
said. 

Is social distancing really 
an effective way to stop the 
spread of the virus?
Eisenberg 
said 
much 
remains unknown about how 
the virus is spread.
“We don’t know a lot about 
the virus, we theorize it is via 
droplet 
spread,” 
Eisenberg 
said. “There are two ways 
this works: On an individual 
level, you are less likely to 
become sick and then on a 
population level, by reducing 
the efficiency of the spread.”
How can you tell if you 
have 
symptoms 
for 
the 
coronavirus or the flu?
While 
they 
may 
have 
similar symptoms at first, 
coronavirus 
is 
marked 
by 
fever and coughing that has 
the possibility to turn into 
pneumonia. While a vaccine 
exists for the flu and there 
is 
antiviral 
medication 
dedicated to treating the flu, 
neither is available for the 
coronavirus at this moment 
since it is so new. 
Are measures like washing 
hands and maintaining a 
six-foot 
distance 
really 
effective?
Eisenberg 
said 
these 
measures can help limit the 
spread of infectious diseases. 
“Slow the spread so that 
even though you have the 
same number of cases, the 
peak is smaller but hospitals 
are less overworked, which is 
important because hospitals 
are built to capacity based 
on the flu season,” Eisenberg 
said. 
What 
measures 
should high and low-risk 
individuals take?

According to Eisenberg, 
“high-risk individuals should 
be more careful with social 
distancing. 
It 
is 
critical 
that they not be around big 
crowds.” 
For 
lower-risk 
people, 
Eisenberg 
said, 
they 
“probably won’t have a major 
illness but they can contribute 
to the transmission. Even 

though students aren’t high-
risk they would be effective 
in its transmission. So for 
example, if you’re traveling a 
lot you might not want to visit 
your 85-year-old grandma.”
How can we learn from 
other affected countries?
Eisenberg 
said 
South 
Korea, where strict isolation 
and 
social 
distancing 
measures 
were 
taken 
to 
prevent infection, provides 
an example of the path the 
U.S. should take in slowing 

the spread of the virus. 
“If we can prevent it from 
being too accelerated we 
can 
prevent 
widespread 
transmission,” 
Eisenberg 
said. “We want to look more 
like South Korea and less like 
Italy. Especially now in this 
critical time period, where 
cases are just emerging, we 
don’t wanna overwhelm the 
hospitals and really unroll 
widespread testing: identify 
the clusters faster and then 
it’s a bit more targeted.”

Is there a time period 
for how long the virus will 
continue to spread?
The answer is still unclear. 
“It won’t be surprising 
if it is seasonal like other 
coronaviruses, but this is a 
unique, emerging pathogen 
and we are still unsure,” 
Eisenberg said.

“We’re taking every step 
that we can to mitigate 
the 
virus 
spread 
and 
keep Michiganders safe,” 
Whitmer said in the press 
conference.
The 
two 
diagnosed 
cases in Michigan include 
a 
middle-aged 
Oakland 
County 
woman 
who 
has 
recently 
traveled 
internationally 
and 
a 
middle-aged Wayne County 
man 
who 
has 
recently 
traveled domestically.
Michigan 
Medicine 
announced 
Wednesday 
morning 
the 
hospital 
is 
treating one of the two 
confirmed 
Michigan 
coronavirus cases. 
According 
to 
the 
University’s 
webpage 
on 
COVID-19, 
individuals 
should wash their hands 
often with soap for 20 
seconds, avoid close contact 
with those who are sick and 
to stay home when sick to 
prevent the spread of the 
virus.
Prior to the University’s 
decision to move classes 
online, universities across 
the 
state 
had 
already 
suspended 
in-person 
classes. 
Michigan 
State 
University 
suspended 
all 
face-to-face 
classes 
beginning at noon today, 
MSU 
President 
Samuel 
Stanley announced in an 
email 
to 
MSU 
students 
this morning. Online class 
instruction will last until 
April 20.
Central 
Michigan 
University 
also 
asked 
students not to return to 
campus after spring break 
and announced they will be 
moving their classes online 
through March 20. CMU 
will make a decision on 
whether to continue online 
classes on March 19.
Wayne State University 
announced 
Wednesday 
afternoon 
it 
will 
be 
extending 
spring 
break 
until March 23 to help plan 
for the transition to online 
classes.

Other 
universities 
across the United States 
have called off in-person 
classes this week, including 
Harvard 
University 
and 
Ohio State University.
As 
classes 
have 
been 
canceled across the country, 
some on social media have 
noted the sudden requests 
for students to leave campus 
may be harder to adjust to 
for students who may rely 
on university housing or 
meal 
plans. 
Additionally, 
they said some students may 
depend on work-study as a 
source of income. 
Others 
have 
noted 
students may not be able 
to go home because of 
transportation 
costs 
or 
travel 
restrictions, 
or 
because coronavirus may 
be more widespread in that 
location. 
Before 
the 
University 
announced the cancellation 
of 
classes, 
students 
on 
campus began creating a 
spreadsheet 
of 
resources 
to help students who may 
be 
disproportionately 
impacted by the changes.
Michigan 
Dining 
sent 
an 
email 
to 
MDining 
employees 
Wednesday 
afternoon letting students 
know they plan to continue 
having food available. 
The 
email 
stated 
MDining 
is 
increasing 
their sanitation processes 
– including the back of the 
house 
and 
some 
spaces 
leading up to the dining hall. 
Additionally, greeters are 
no longer swiping M-Cards 
and students swipe their 
own. 
Symptoms of coronavirus 
include fever, cough and 
shortness of breath. To stop 
the spread of the virus, the 
Centers for Disease Control 
recommend 
people 
wash 
their hands often and avoid 
touching their eyes, nose 
and mouth.

The 
main 
concern, 
according 
to 
Martin, 
is 
containing its rapid spread. 
“Most people that get 
this virus aren’t going to be 
severely ill,” Martin said. 
“When you’ve got a new 
virus that’s potentially going 
to affect large numbers of 
people, what you want to do 
is try to slow things down as 
much as possible, and a good 
way to do that is to stop 
people from congregating in 
big groups. The University 
could do a whole lot by being 
as flexible as possible with 
allowing students to recover 
from at home when they’re 
sick.”
Sue Anne Bell, assistant 
professor at the School of 
Nursing and a specialist 
in the effects of health 
disasters, 
added 
that 
COVID-19’s effect on the 
young, healthy demographic 
is minimal while the risk for 
elderly populations or those 
with chronic diseases is 
much greater.
“For people that have no 
significant 
health 
issues, 
young 
adults 
who 
are 
healthy in general, and also 
in children, there have been 
fairly low rates of serious 
complications,” Bell said. 
“The bigger issue is that, 
while a college-age student 
might contract the virus, it’s 
the spreading of the virus to 
other groups of people who 
have those chronic diseases, 
or 
an 
older 
population 
where they’re much more 
susceptible to some of those 
serious effects.”
Sandro Cinti, professor 
of 
infectious 
disease 
at 
Michigan Medicine who is 
involved 
in 
preparations 
for 
emerging 
infectious 
diseases, 
commented 
on 
the misconceptions he has 
encountered in comparison 
to the reality of the virus. 
“I know a lot of people 
have visions of many people 
dying and being in the 
hospital, but very likely 
most people will be fine, 
they won’t ever have to 
even go to the doctor,” Cinti 
said. “It’s a disease that we 
need to pay attention to, 
but generally, people will 
do pretty well even if they 
get infected with it, and 
there are no treatments and 
there’s no vaccine at this 
time, so it’s really all about 
community mitigation.”
Cinti explained some of 
the measures that Michigan 
Medicine 
is 
taking 
to 
prepare 
for 
COVID-19 
patients and how they plan 
to keep other patients safe.
“We’re looking at how 
we’re 
going 
to 
manage 
patients within the hospital, 
where we’re going to put 
patients, where we would 
cohort 
patients, 
putting 
them in certain parts of 
the hospital where they 
will be so they wouldn’t be 
exposed to other patients,” 
Cinti said. “There’s only 
limited testing right now. 

So if somebody wants to 
come in and get a test, they 
won’t be able to get it … 
unless they have symptoms 
and a very positive screen 
for having been exposed to 
Coronavirus.”
With 
the 
apparent 
minimal threat to a young 
and healthy demographic 
and 
the 
high 
potential 
for spread to higher risk 
populations, 
University 
epidemiologists and health 
care professionals said the 
best courses of large scale 
action against COVID-19 
are collective efforts to 
lower community’s health 
risks. 
Arnold 
Monto, 
the 
Thomas Francis Collegiate 
Professor of Epidemiology 
at the School of Public 
Health and an international 
expert 
on 
transmission 
prevention, 
said 
in 
similar 
flu 
outbreaks, 
pharmaceutical 
resources 
have been available but 
are lacking in the current 
situation.
“What 
is 
really 
most 
pertinent 
in 
terms 
of 
what’s going on now is 
the attention on what are 
called non pharmaceutical 
interventions because the 
three pillars of response 
to a flu pandemic were 
antivirals, 
vaccines 
and 
non-pharmaceutical 
intervention,” Monto said. 
“We don’t have two of the 
pillars for COVID-19.”
With the evident necessity 
for 
non-pharmaceutical 
intervention, Bell proposed 
taking the idea of serious 
social 
distancing 
within 
the University community 
as 
opposed 
to 
mass 
quarantines. 
“I think we have to move 
from this idea of these 
large 
scale 
quarantines 
to thinking about social 
distancing,” Bell said. “We 
don’t have the systems in 
place to just flip a switch 
and turn to an online class 
or cancel classes, but when it 
boils down to it, promoting 
and preserving the health 
of our community might be 
the more important thing 
to think about than missing 
class.”
In 
the 
past 
week, 
multiple 
universities 
across the country have 
canceled 
in-person 
classes in response to the 
virus, 
including 
Harvard 
University and Ohio State 
University. Many professors 
at the University have said 
they are preparing to move 
classes online in the event 
that 
the 
administration 
instructs them to do so.
STAMPS Professor Susan 
Funkenstein 
has 
already 
moved her ARTDES 151 
class online for a period 
of two weeks after being 
asked to explore alternative 
lecture delivery modes. 
Brad 
Smith, 
associate 
dean for academic programs 
at the Stamps School of 
Art & Design, wrote about 
efforts 
the 
school 
was 
making to determine the 
best way to continue the 

semester 
when 
classes 
moved online in an email to 
The Daily.
“Like the rest of the 
University, 
the 
Stamps 
School of Art & Design 
is taking a look at our 
current 
course 
offerings 
and evaluating alternative 
modes of delivery should the 
need arise,” Smith wrote. 
“As part of this exploration 
and at the request of our 
Dean, Guna Nadarajan, two 
Stamps 
lecturers, 
Susan 
Funkenstein and Melanie 
Manos, 
were 
asked 
to 
explore alternative modes 
of course delivery for the 
lecture component of their 
courses.”
Smith also addressed how 
University 
administration 
had instructed faculty to 
proceed with planning in 
the event that in person 
classes are not permitted to 
meet. 
“University 
administration 
has 
been 
asking units to consider 
how 
we 
might 
deliver 
classes to students under 
conditions where students 
or faculty might not be 
able to attend in person, 
in order to be prepared 
for a range of conditions,” 
Smith wrote. “For students 
who 
are 
currently 
self-
quarantining or ill: faculty 
at Stamps are ready to 
provide 
accommodations. 
This is being addressed on 
a 1-1 basis.”
Students 
discussed 
varying views on COVID-19 
with The Daily, specifically 
regarding the health risks 
it poses to campus and 
the 
necessity 
for 
either 
school closure or online 
classes instead of in-person 
meetings. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Ryan 
Fisher, secretary of the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 
sent an email out to the 
organization Sunday night 
dismissing concerns that 
coronavirus is the “end of 
the world.”
“Also, don’t worry so much 
about 
the 
Coronavirus: 
the idea that this is the 
end of the world is FAKE 
NEWS! It’s a virus, not 
far removed from normal 
flu,” Fisher’s email reads. 
“Even if you get the virus, 
if your immune system is 
half-functional, then you’d 
likely survive regardless. 
Don’t fall for the HOAX of 
world destruction. Literally 
wash your hands and stay 
home if you’re sick. Easy.”
LSA 
freshman 
Nick 
Schuler, 
spokesman 
for 
College Republicans, told 
The Daily the statement 
was referencing the panic 
that the media is portraying 
about the coronavirus.
“Ryan said ‘the idea that 
Coronavirus is the end of 
the world is fake news!’ 
This is in reference to the 
hyperbolic 
fearmongering 
done by the media that has 
inspired nothing but panic, 
making 
matters 
worse,” 
Schuler 
said. 
“He 
also 
points out that the survival 

rate is very high for those 
with functioning immune 
systems, also true. We feel 
that the school has created 
a culture of fear around 
the virus rather than one 
of understanding and that 
the outlook for the virus 
is much better than the 
doomsday narrative being 
put out by alarmists.”
On 
Tuesday, 
it 
was 
announced that an EECS 
280 midterm exam initially 
scheduled for Wednesday 
will now be online as a 
precaution 
against 
the 
spread of COVID-19.
LSA 
freshman 
Hadley 
Samarco, who is enrolled 
in EECS 280, said there 
was a lot of backlash to 
this decision and gave her 
personal reaction to the 
change. 
“There is a lot of confusion 
and backlash right now, 
because originally you were 
supposed to still abide to 
just having a note sheet and 
not cheating, and there was 
a lot of concern as to how 
that’ll work,” Samarco said. 
“I appreciate the concern, 
but I think it’s more trouble 
than it’s worth.”
LSA 
freshman 
Deanna 
Dwyer said she thinks the 
University’s emails about 
COVID-19 
have 
been 
a 
good way to stay informed 
and 
that 
while 
certain 
professors 
are 
changing 
their attendance policies, 
she does not wish to take 
online classes. 
“I would be really upset 
if we have to go to online 
classes, just because I feel 
like clubs would have to 
stop meeting then too,” 
Dwyer 
said. 
“And 
not 
everyone 
has 
access 
to 
computers and this could 
really affect those who are 
not as economically stable.”
In an effort to keep campus 
healthy 
for 
community 
members who are not self-
isolating, the department 
of 
Environment, 
Health 
& 
Safety 
and 
Custodial 
& Grounds Services are 
expanding 
their 
efforts 
to clean heavy-trafficked 
areas. 
Danielle Sheen, executive 
director of EHS, explained 
the precautions EHS and 
the Custodial and Grounds 
Services 
are 
taking 
to 
sanitize buildings at the 
University 
in 
an 
email 
to 
The 
Daily.“For 
main 
campus buildings served 
by Custodial and Grounds 
Services, they have been 
increasing their frequency 
of cleaning of the high 
touch 
point 
surfaces,” 
Sheen wrote. “Dorm rooms 
are cleaned by students, 
but common areas in dorms 
are cleaned by Housing 
Custodial 
Staff. 
They 
ramped up their efforts for 
cleaning as well with the 
return of students from 
Spring Break.”

CONCERN
From Page 1

The statement said the risk is 
low for employees and visitors, 
regardless of proximity to 
where the patient is located 
or whether individuals have 
been in the hospital recently. 
The statement noted risk is 
considered high for those 
without protective equipment 
with prolonged exposure to 
someone with symptoms.
Additionally, the statement 
noted 
Michigan 
Medicine 
is monitoring the “rapidly 

evolving” 
situation 
with 
state and local public health 
officials. Michigan Medicine 
has 
been 
monitoring 
the 
supply of “crucial” items such 
as masks, hand sanitizer and 
other protective equipment 
and has been placing orders 
for additional quantities, the 
statement said. 
In 
an 
email 
sent 
to 
Michigan 
Medicine 
volunteers 
Wednesday 
afternoon, Loulie Meynard, 
Volunteer Services director, 
advised volunteers not to 
come in for their scheduled 
shifts 
and 
all 
absences 

starting from March 8 will 
not be counted in volunteers’ 
records. 
While 
Meynard 
said Michigan Medicine is 
not saying volunteers may 
not come in, she noted that 
directive is expected to come 
soon.
On Wednesday afternoon, 
University 
 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
a 
two-day 
cancellation of classes. On 
Monday, classes will resume 
online until the end of the 
semester. 
Spring 
study 
abroad programs have been 
canceled. 

Michigan State University 
announced 
Wednesday 
morning that all in-person 
classes will be moved online 
through April 20. With the 
move, MSU joined schools 
including Harvard University, 
Indiana University and the 
University of Toledo who have 
altered in-person education 
in response to COVID-19.

PATIENT
From Page 1

More than 20 women have 
brought 
forward 
sexual 
misconduct claims against 
the former provost. In 2009, 
an 
anonymous 
woman 
reported that Philbert had 
sexually harassed her.
Thomas 
Komorowski, 
a 
former research associate for 
the University who worked 
in Philbert’s lab at the School 
of Public Health in 2003, 
claimed in a 2004 lawsuit he 
was wrongfully terminated 
due 
to 
an 
inappropriate 
relationship 
between 
Philbert 
and 
a 
female 
researcher. Philbert denied 
that Komorowski was laid off 
due to his relationship with 
the female researcher and 
claimed Komorowski’s grant 
aid had run out.
The University retained an 
outside firm to investigate 
Philbert, a process that is 
still ongoing, according to 
the statement. 
“Once it is complete, a 
determination will be made 
whether Philbert will be 
subject 
to 
proceedings 
to remove him from his 
faculty role,” the statement 
reads. “Meanwhile, Philbert 
will 
remain 
on 
paid 
administrative leave from his 
duties as a tenured faculty 
member.”
Philbert is now on paid 
administrative 
leave 
from 
his position as a tenured 
professor of toxicology in the 
School of Public Health. As 
Public Health Dean, Philbert 
earned $463,696 in 2016.
In the statement, Schlissel 
said the investigation is still 
underway, 
with 
resources 
provided to those affected.
“As 
the 
investigation 
continues, 
we 
encourage 
anyone 
with 
information 
to come forward and we 
encourage anyone affected 
by this issue to use the 
confidential 
counseling 

resources we have set up,” 
Schlissel said. 
As 
provost, 
Philbert 
was 
the 
highest-ranking 
University 
administrator 
after 
Schlissel. 
Philbert 
earned about $570,000 a year 
in his position, where he also 
acted as the top academic 
officer and chief budgetary 
officer. 
Susan M. Collins, former 
dean of the Ford School of 
Public Policy, was named 
acting 
provost 
in 
late 
January. 
Schlissel now plans to 
recommend 
Collins 
serve 
as interim provost at the 
Board of Regents meeting on 
March 26.
Philbert 
was 
approved 
as provost in June 2017, 
assuming 
the 
office 
in 
September 
of 
that 
year. 
Before that, he served as 
dean of the School of Public 
Health.
Last fall, Philbert played 
a role in the formation of a 
faculty group to consider 
amending 
the 
bylaws 
regarding the dismissal of 
tenured faculty. In October 
2019, he met with the Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University Affairs after the 
firing 
of 
Music, 
Theater 
& Dance professor David 
Daniels for allegations of 
sexual 
misconduct 
and 
discussed 
amendments 
to policies governing the 
removal process.
“We have to be very careful 
and thoughtful, and quickly 
amend the bylaws to protect 
tenure and to protect our 
faculty and to protect society 
from the bad behavior that is 
frequently in the headlines,” 
Philbert said at the meeting.

T

he Oscars 2020 reminded 
me all too well of the 
feeling you have when 
your grandma gives you a 
strange scarf for your birthday. 
It’s not what you wanted, but 
the gesture was nice. All you 
can do is hope that next year 
gets better, right?
While there have been a lot 
of loud, feminist moments, the 
Oscars 
ultimately 
continue 
to snuff women out of many 
categories, most notably “Best 
Director.” 
After 
92 
years, 
only five women have been 
nominated for the category and 
only one, Kathryn Bigelow, has 
won. Greta Gerwig, who is one 
of these five women, did not 
receive a nomination for her 
Best Picture nominated movie, 
“Little Women,” at the Oscars 
2020. This was disappointing, 
but not shocking. She and many 
other creative female directors, 
such as Lulu Wang and Lorene 
Scafaria, were shut out from the 
Academy’s nomination this year, 
following suit with the majority 
of previous Oscars. The most 
vocalized discrepancy with the 
Oscars nominations lies with 
the Best Director category — 
but the prioritization of men 
does not stop there.
It’s not surprising that, in 
general, the majority of movies 
nominated for Best Picture 
have 
male-centered 
themes 
and storylines. Nominees for 
this year, such as “1917,” “The 
Irishman,” “Ford v Ferrari” 
and “Once Upon a Time in 
Hollywood,” follow suit as the 
central ideas (war, cars, the 
mafia and Quentin Tarantino) 
are all male-dominated. Of the 
92 Best Picture winners, only 
14 winners have a story that 
follows a female lead. The Oscar 
nominations often portray the 
subconscious values of viewers 
and the sexist limitations in 
Hollywood. It’s not that movies 
such as “The Irishman” or “Ford 

v Ferrari” weren’t noteworthy, 
but it’s important to recognize 
their advantage over movies like 
“Little Women” due to the fact 
that they follow the normative 
style of a “winning” movie: 
male-based with male leads.

In 
a 
recent 
interview 
with 
Vanity 
Fair, 
Amy 
Pascal, 
producer 
of 
“Little 
Women,” discussed the lack 
of male presence in the public 
screenings of “Little Women.” 
“I don’t think that (men) came 
to the screenings in droves, 
let me put it that way,” Pascal 
said. “...and I’m not sure when 
they got their DVDs that they 
watched them.” Obviously, this 
was disconcerting considering 
a majority of the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences 
voting 
membership 
is held by men, with only 32 
percent of the members being 
women in 2019. “It’s a different 
bias,” 
Pascal 
said. 
“(Voters 
think), these kinds of stories are 
important to me, and these kinds 
of stories are less important to 
me.” From this, it’s important to 
note how the gender reference 
within the title “Little Women” 
alone would discourage a male 
audience.
Instead of being viewed solely 
as a good movie, the gender 
reference in “Little Women” 
transforms it into a “girl” movie. 
For 
most 
movies, 
without 
knowing the plot, the sole fact 
of having a female lead makes 

it a “girl” movie. Typically, 
when a movie has a male lead, 
it is not labeled a “boy” movie. 
It is simply a movie. The 
distinction 
between 
movies 
and “girl” movies originates 
from centuries of patriarchal 
influence and suppression of 
female cultural works. I know I 
can resonate with stories told by 
men about men, so to my male 
counterparts who refuse to see 
movies like “Little Women” 
because they are “girly,” I urge 
you to give it a try. At heart, all 
these movies are stories about 
people, not just women or men, 
and the human experience — 
despite our differences — is 
something we can all relate to.
Despite 
the 
lack 
of 
recognition 
women 
received 
with regard to the awards, the 
Oscars desperately tried to 
display their support of women 
and 
feminist 
movements. 
From Brie Larson, Gal Gadot 
and 
Sigourney 
Weaver 
declaring 
that 
“all 
women 
are superheroes” to the first 
female conductor leading the 
Oscars orchestra for the Best 
Original Score segment, the 
Oscars seemed to be all about 
women. While the gestures 
were appreciated, recognizing 
women are talented isn’t the 
same as rewarding women for 
their talent. Instead of just 
recognizing that women aren’t 
nominated for Best Director, 
maybe it’s time to call out the 
social and systematic reasons 
for this and directly challenge 
the Academy’s decisions. This is 
not to diminish many beautiful 
moments that occurred, such as 
Hildur Guðnadóttir’s acceptance 
speech or Natalie Portman’s 
homage to female directors, 
but only to encourage further 
progress and not to forget the 
work that needs to be done.

H

ere 
I 
am, 
typing 
this 
column 
far 
too 
close 
to 
its 
deadline, at 12:38 a.m. There 
are numerous tabs open on 
my laptop including Amazon, 
the political science midterm 
study guide I finished at 
ungodly hours the previous 
night and the Expedia tab for 
the flight at the end of the 
tunnel of this hellish exam 
week. I am, as most students 
would call it, #grinding. 
Here 
at 
the 
University 
of Michigan, the collegiate 
societal pressure to “grind” our 
work out offsets a life balance 
disproportionately focused on 
social media engagement and 
party culture. As I currently 
partake in this social scheme, 
I am in no position to speak 
down to the other members 
of this community of grind 
worshippers. 
The 
large 
iced coffee condensing on 
the 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library table beside me and I 
have both endured many late-
night study sessions. However, 
I’ve begun to wonder: When 
did working hard come to 
mean 
procrastination 
and 
cramming? Hard work was 
once attributed to committing 
to 
a 
particular 
task 
or 
challenge and exerting some 
sort of mental, physical or 
emotional effort toward a goal. 
Now, I associate hard work 
with bloodshot eyes at 3 a.m. 
in the South Quad Residence 
Hall study lounge.
While hard work is integral 
to 
success, 
this 
stressful 
lifestyle is disorganized and 
reinforces unhealthy concepts 
of time management. It is not 
cool to be exhausted. It doesn’t 
make you more accomplished 
to have slept four hours less 
than the human body craves. 
Yet in top-tier academia, we 
exert so much effort into both 
work and play and often fail to 
efficiently organize this time 
to allow for the maximum 
amount of productivity and 
therefore, 
the 
maximum 
quality of life. During the 
prime grind of midterms in 
the UGLi, why are so many 
phones 
scrolling 
through 
TikTok instead of actually 
studying? This inclination to 
grind has spawned a culture 
where 
students’ 
schedules 
become 
a 
hodgepodge 
of 
overlapping 
engagements. 
This disorganized chaos of 
scheduling is a major factor in 
reduced sleep and significantly 
reduced productivity. I have 
met two kinds of people in 
college: 
People 
who, 
like 
me, do not sleep and run on 
copious amounts of caffeine 
and people who take naps 
throughout their day. Neither 
of these groups enjoys the 
recommended eight hours of 
sleep allotted at nighttime, 

and instead, make use of 
alternative methods to get by. 
Perhaps instead of studying 
when we should be sleeping, 
sleeping when we should be 
socializing 
and 
socializing 
when we should be studying, 
we could acknowledge our 
faults and better manage our 
bustling schedules.

It seems the true antagonist 
in this story is distraction. 
According to Forbes writer 
Cheryl 
Conner, 
“a 
survey 
revealed sixty-four percent 
of employees visit non-work 
related websites every day of 
the week.” As people in the 
21st century, we are drawn to 
our phones more than ever. 
We lose track of time and 
suddenly the three hours we 
had planned to study for our 
exam or write our Michigan 
Daily columns were wasted 
scrolling through the endless 
cybersphere of constantly-
updating information. If the 
phone had been neglected 
for those three hours, then 
maybe we could spend time 
before 
bed 
engaging 
in 
social activities instead of 
accomplishing 
previously-
scheduled tasks at the hours 
meant for sleeping.
How do we fix this? When 
I say “we,” I genuinely mean 
that. I am both guilty and 
outspoken about what at this 
point seems like an allergy to 
an adequate night’s sleep and 
a relaxing day. I’ve realized 
that, 
despite 
my 
endless 
efforts to color code and 
plan my life, the tendency 
for my phone-usage study 
break almost always expands 
beyond the five or 10-minute 
limit 
I 
try 
to 
establish. 
The 
idea 
of 
organizing 
time 
through 
schedule 
compartmentalization, 
though 
not 
fool-proof, 
is 
useful in more ways than 
one. There is psychological 
research 
that 
shows 
the 
benefits 
of 
checking 
off 
tasks titled the “Zeigarnik 
Effect.” By simply writing 
these plans down as minute 
missions instead of daunting 
obstacles, accomplishing our 
goals becomes less anxiety-
ridden 
and 
overwhelming. 
The caveat, of course, is that 
the 
number 
of 
remaining 
tasks on our lifelong to-do 
list 
can 
further 
impact 

anxiety and result in more 
procrastination.
Harry Guinness of The 
New York Times offers an 
instructional guide for how 
“A (Former) Night Owl” can 
become a “Morning Person.” 
Guinness describes how any 
person can adapt their sleep 
and life schedule to increase 
productivity and align with 
a better “chronotype,” or 
individual interpretation of 
circadian rhythm. What is 
important to clarify is that 
this isn’t all about sleeping 
more. There are plenty of 
people 
who 
sleep 
eight, 
nine or even 10 hours and 
still waste large amounts of 
time throughout their day 
dawdling on social media 
sites 
instead 
of 
working 
through their daily tasks. 
Beyond allowing your body 
to rest at appropriate times, 
you need to encourage and 
challenge yourself to stick 
to 
an 
efficient 
regiment 
throughout the day; pencil 
in a time for leisure, exercise 
and work or school goals. 
Just doing one or the other 
perpetuates imbalance.
A mantra I came to appreciate 
more 
upon 
starting 
my 
freshman year at the University 
is “work smarter, not harder.” It 
is irrefutable that the students 
at this school, not unlike other 
schools, are dedicated to their 
work and seek to get the best 
education 
possible 
for 
the 
tuition they are paying to study 
here. However, Forbes writer 
Julian Mitchell suggests it’s 
time to stop the grind, and 
instead learn to hustle. The 
difference, Mitchell writes, is 
that while both are qualified 
and in possession of equal 
capabilities, 
grinders 
“move 
at a fast pace, juggle multiple 
tasks” and “can work tirelessly 
and see no return.” Conversely, 
“hustlers put effort into existing 
opportunities” and “know what 
it really takes to achieve the 
seemingly impossible.”
Nobody I have met thus 
far, and undoubtedly very few 
people in general, have truly 
mastered a perfectly planned 
life balance of work, sleep, 
exercise and fun. But I’d like to 
put more effort into trying, and 
I encourage you to do the same. 
I’d like to know that the hard 
work we are all exerting is 
being utilized efficiently. There 
will always be time for 
spontaneity and moments that 
will never have a key on your 
color code, but for one week, 
try and be more cognizant 
of the time you dedicate to 
different sectors of your life. 
Take out your AirPods, grab 
your highlighters and find a 
better way to hustle. 

O

n Jan. 12, 2020, I 
rejoined 
the 
ranks 
of being single, or in 
the words of my roommate, 
I got remarried to the game. 
I was single for most of 
freshman year, so I thought I 
was well acquainted with my 
new life; but, when I started 
dating again, everything felt 
different. Soon, I realized 
that the game itself had not 
changed, but I had. See, for 
the last year, dating was no 
game to me because I was in 
love with my girlfriend. But 
now I found myself in the 
starting lineup of a game I no 
longer understood.
In the dating game, we 
devalue people and reduce 
them to numbers; we rate 
them on a scale of one to 10; 
we constantly brag about 
our hookups to mask our 
feelings; we swipe on Tinder 
because we’re bored. Talking 
to friends, I am constantly 
astonished by the numbers 
they casually mention. 238 
Tinder matches. 12 bodies. 
23 Snapchats. Of those three 
people, they have collectively 
been on two dates and in no 
relationships over the last six 
months. Now, don’t get me 
wrong, I am in no position to 
slut shame anyone. I’m not 
even looking for a relationship 
right now, but I am looking 
for something beyond the 
meaningless 
games 
we’re 
playing. To transcend the 
games and make dating work 
again, we must address a 
couple of core issues.
Problem 1: Single people 
are too selfish.
Every Thursday, I wake up 
at about 9:45 a.m., just in time 
to sprint to my 10 a.m. I put 
in my headphones and don’t 
open my mouth until I need 
participation points. I attend 
classes until 4 p.m. and, after 
napping, either go to Hatcher 
to do homework or hang out 
with my friends. Wash, rinse, 
repeat. We all get caught 
up in these vicious cycles 
of routines because they’re 
comfortable and, in many 
ways, 
necessary. 
However, 
this conventional routine is 
flawed because it revolves 
entirely around one person.
While monotonous at times, 
our routines bestow upon us 

the curse of independence 
before our minds have fully 
developed. We grow up so 
self-reliant and self-conscious 
that we inevitably become 
self-centered and run the risk 
of becoming egotistical. Thus, 
when we venture to date — 
whether casual or serious — 
we struggle with empathy, 
which allows us to justify 
mistreating others or makes 
us oblivious altogether.
This phenomenon influences 
the decisions we make when 
pursuing 
potential 
partners 
because many of us are simply 
too 
self-conscious 
to 
talk 
to new people — except on 
Tinder, 
which 
I’ll 
address 
later. Instead, we prefer to 
stay confined in our social 
circles, which consolidates the 
dating pool considerably. In 
fact, Engineering senior Arjun 
Lama encapsulated it perfectly 
when he said: “I go to Rick’s, 
but no one meets people there. 
If you go up to someone, then, 
all of a sudden, you’re weird.” 
Now, this is where I draw a line. 
If there’s a social stigma against 
talking to people in a bar, we 
have officially gone too far. In 
order to expand our horizons, 
our generation needs to be 
bolder and reshape the dating 
landscape. Go talk to that 
cute girl in your biology class. 
Go sit with that hot guy in the 
dining hall. The world won’t 
shatter. The worst thing they 
can say is no.
Problem 2: Single people 
are too fake.
Have you ever looked at 
someone on Instagram after 
you met them in real life, but 
you didn’t recognize them 
at all? Today, we have this 
image that everyone should 
put forward a perfect face 
online. We need to look our 
best or people won’t put forth 
the effort to learn the person 
underneath the looks. Enter, 
Tinder.
Everyone who has told you 
that looks don’t matter is 
either someone hot, lying to 
themselves or someone who 
is not on Tinder. Looks aren’t 
insignificant, 
but 
they’re 
definitely 
not 
the 
most 
important thing. In person, 
you can overwhelm someone 
with your charm and bravado 
while Tinder’s main form of 

currency is ab muscles. Now, 
Tinder has some redeeming 
qualities 
like 
their 
bio 
section, Spotify preferences 
and the post-match messaging 
process. However, in order 
to get to the best parts of 
the app, people deem your 
attraction worthy of their 
attention. That’s what I call a 
flawed process.
If you want to cut through 
the noise, you can, but it’s 
exceedingly difficult when 
you only meet people through 
Tinder or through friends. 
Much 
like 
the 
previous 
problem, the solution is to 
get outside of the ordinary 
and meet some strangers. 
No 
matter 
what 
you’re 
looking for, you’ll probably 
find someone better in real 
life than you ever could on 
Tinder, and that is the point.
June 
14, 
2018: 
During 
orientation, I was on a bus 
talking with a friend about 
fantasy football when the bus 
came to a screeching halt and 
I fell forward into the girl 
in front of me. While I was 
profusely 
apologizing, 
she 
turned around and I noticed 
her piercing green eyes and 
dirty blonde hair. She said, 
“It’s okay, don’t worry about 
it. By the way, I’m Morgan.” 
I spent the rest of the night 
talking 
to 
the 
charming 
stranger, going back to East 
Quad and then to Bubble 
Island. 
Right 
before 
we 
left Bubble Island, I heard 
a thunderclap and saw a 
torrential downpour outside. 
I took her hand and we ran 
out. In the middle of that 
summer storm, I spun her 
around and we kissed. That’s 
why I talk to strangers.
At the end of the day, 
dating isn’t that complex. It’s 
just two people who want to 
be noticed, to be seen and 
accepted for who they truly 
are. Whether it is for one 
night or a lifetime, the rush 
in your head, the fluttering of 
your heart and the tingling of 
your skin make you feel alive. 
Those things make you want 
to step out of your bubble, 
stop being selfish and care 
for someone else.

Badmouthed, 
banned 
and 
ultimately 
blacklisted 
for 
their unwavering 
antiwar sentiment 
in 2003, the Dixie 
Chicks are battle-
tested. 
After 
a 
14-year hiatus, the 
ex-country music 
superstars 
have 
proven 
they’re 
ready to go another 
round 
with 
the 
fiery single “Gaslighter.”
A 
“gaslighter” 
describes 
a 
manipulative 
abuser. 
In 
the 
song “Gaslighter,” this abuser 
is lead singer Natalie Maines’s 
ex-husband. 
By 
linking 
the 
narrative of Maines’s divorce to 
the broader context of sexism, 

the Dixie Chicks retain their 
commitment to being political in 
a form that’s easier to swallow 
— a break-up song. “Tried to say 
I’m crazy, babe, we know I’m not 
crazy, that’s you / gaslighting,” 
Maines sings in disgust. In a 
moment stripped 
of production, she 
quietly 
admits 
“you broke me,” 
giving light to the 
hurt beneath her 
anger. 
The rest of the 
song is explosive. 
Co-written 
and 
co-produced 
by 
pop 
whiz 
Jack 
Antonoff, 
“Gaslighter” is expectedly catchy. 
“Gaslighter, 
denier 
/ 
doing 
anything to get your ass farther” 
is chanted along to pounding, 
building drums. Antonoff’s hand 
in the track along with the rest of 
the upcoming album is probably 
a major red flag to any old-school 

Dixie Chicks fan. But the richness 
of the group’s harmonies and the 
prominent use of banjo in the lead 
single should put those fears to 
rest, at least temporarily. 
For now, all there’s left to do is 
count down the days until May 1st, 
the album release date, and shout 
along to “Gaslighter.” Who knows 
who or what the Dixie Chicks are 
going to burn down next?

In new music video, Taylor

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW
SINGLE REVIEW

REPUBLIC

Just 
last 
year, 
Taylor 
Swift returned to her roots 
as the flowery, love-struck 
songwriter with her single 
“Lover” and gave us an album 
that sharply contrasted the 
pointed rage from her 2017 
album Reputation. Last week 
Swift released a music video 
for “The Man,” a song off her 
latest album, and returned 
to her targeting metaphors 
and sometimes not-so-subtle 
accusations. 
“The Man” features Swift 
in full drag as she portrays 
toxic masculinity and takes 
on the role of ‘The Man.’ 
She’s loud and rude, yells at 
coworkers and gets rewarded 
for doing next to nothing. 
Through these brief incidents, 

Swift pokes fun at what she 
considers to be masculine 
norms 
and 
highlights 
the 
double standard women face 
by turning the tables. 
Not surprisingly, Swift not-
so-subtly calls out Scooter 
Braun, the man who bought all 
of her masters and essentially 
wiped Swift of the rights to 
her own music. In the video, 
Swift walks through a subway 
and comes across a wall spray-
painted with the names of all 
of her albums that Scooter 
owns. On top of that, Swift 
incorporated signs onto the 
wall that read “Missing: If 
Found Return to Taylor Swift” 
and even a “no scooters” sign. 
It’s no secret that women 
in music face many obstacles, 
and Swift has clearly had 
enough with the misogynistic 
nature of the music industry. 
While her portrayal of men 
seems a bit dramatic and 
perhaps even unfair, the final 

scene where Swift is revealed 
as the director of the video 
is empowering and the most 
powerful part of the video. 
In truth, Swift doesn’t need 
to 
aggressively 
attack 
the 
male population to defy the 
patriarchy — she just needs to 
be herself and be an example 
for other women through all 
of the great things she’s done.

Who knows 
who the Dixie 
Chicks will burn 
down next 

Make no mistake — “The Invisible Man” is a true 
story. When one considers its source material, an 1897 
novel by H.G. Wells, this sounds like a wild claim. 
After all, nobody (that we know of) can become 
invisible, 
even 
centuries 
after 
the original book was published. 
Yet, this 2020 remake, which at 
first glance appears to be another 
desperate Hollywood cash-grab, is 
more true to life than most other 
offerings at the movies today. 
While the particulars of what 
Cecilia, played by Elizabeth Moss 
(“The Handmaid’s Tale”), endures 
are science fiction, they are simply 
imaginative means to a very real end. 
Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen, “The 
Haunting of Hill House”), a wealthy 
inventor 
and 
Cecilia’s 
abusive 
ex-husband, is so inflamed by Cecilia 
leaving him that he terrorizes her 
by turning invisible. The invisibility is fantasy, but 
Adrian’s arrogance, emotional manipulation and 
violence, which come from a deep, white-male 
privilege, are anything but. This gives the movie’s 
already well-made scares a core of indelible truth, 

making the story feel truly real. 
Writer-director Leigh Whannell (“Upgrade”) 
throws the viewer into Cecilia’s situation with 
razor sharp efficiency. The grungy, gray-soaked 
cinematography turns even the sunniest of days into 
something terrifying, making viewers wonder what 
lurks in every shadow. Sometimes the camera lingers 
on stillness, like a rack of knives or sheets in a dark 
bedroom, leaving the viewer waiting, breathless, like 
Cecilia. Waiting for what they know 
is coming but can’t possibly see until 
it’s too late.
The soundtrack crawls deep 
under one’s skin and stays there, 
coloring the visible horrors with 
stomach-churning 
blasts 
of 
unnerving synth. The script oozes 
with hand-wringing tension that 
never lets up, providing gut punch 
twists that blast the story forward 
even when it already seems to be 
hurtling at an impossibly high 
speed. Moss, as always, gives an 
immaculate performance that has 
one’s sympathies from the very 
start, ratcheting up the tension in 
every possible moment. For most other actors, a 
scene where a character is beaten up by an invisible 
man would be awkward at best, hilarious at worst. 
In Moss’s hands, it is one of the scariest, most heart-
wrenching scenes in recent memory. “The Invisible 

Man” is no haunted house attraction, and you will be 
sickened, afraid and exhausted once it’s over. 
Horror this stupendous does not come around 
often. The movie is not for the faint of heart, but 
should be seen by anyone who can stomach it. It’s 
especially satisfying once Cecilia fights back, giving 
viewers a look at something that rarely happens 
offscreen — a rich, white, male predator brought 
to justice. From film directors to the Commander 
in Chief, many of these abusers stay invisible even 
when their crimes are in plain sight, hidden behind 
their privilege. Others are only unmasked after 

vast swaths of damage have already occurred and, 
because of their status, can stay relatively invisible, 
unscathed by the harsh justice they deserve. It’s 
satisfying to see one of these monsters put through 
the wringer, even if only on the silver screen. 
“The Invisible Man” is a marathon of scares and 
heart, proving, like “Get Out,” “The Babadook” and 
“The Witch” before it, that horror can be one of the 
most meaningful, optimistic and authentic genres. It 
also may be the most vital — even in 2020, America 
still needs to learn that the monster never, ever 
should get away with it.

What does it mean to be a woman? Statistics, 
the media, society –– many of them would answer 
that womanhood lies in the gender wage gap, the 
tampon tax, abortion rights; the drawn out Harvey 
Weinstein legal battle or the #MeToo movement; 
in the Kardashian empire, Ladies Night at the local 
bar, or TikTok videos of preteen VSCO girls; broken 
stilettos, a Brazilian body wax, fake eyelashes. At 
least, these are the superficial labels that dog the 
steps of womanhood. 
More often, womanhood is understood only 
in contrast to the patriarchy. Womanhood is a 
battle –– armor worn from girl-hood until death, 
triumphantly painted in the colors of the conquest 
of man. Yet even here, in the fiery protest against 
gender-conforming shackles, there is no woman 
without man. Let us rewrite the question: What 
does it mean to be a woman in spite of man? 
An answer (by no means the only one) can be 
found within the heart of The Secret Sisters’ new 
album, Saturn Return. The Secret Sisters have 
written an ode to womankind; a dedication to 
womanly mind, body and heart. It is an album 

which finds its truth in the contrasting sharp 
edges and soft curves of womanhood. Here, man is 
irrelevant, obsolete. He is not torn down or ravaged 
in fury –– these are not the songs of a battle waged 
against patriarchy. Rather, man holds no place in 
Saturn Return because these are stories of women, 
of womanhood, not of mankind or masculinity. 
To be “Woman” –– Saturn Return explores this 
independently of patriarchal contrast, in its own 
basking glory. 
Saturn Return can be broken down into four parts, 
four core songs that make up The Secret Sisters 
exploration of Woman: “Silver,” “Fair,” “Nowhere, 
Baby,” and “Water Witch.” Each song presents a 
different aspect of womanhood, examined and 
experienced in the context and lens of women alone. 
 
“Silver” is a dedication to the relationships 
between mothers and daughters. It is womanhood 
defined by motherhood, but confined to the special 
bond between women, and not the limitations of 
marriage or patriarchal oppression. The only song 
on the album that prominently recalls the country 
roots of previous work by The Secret Sisters, “Silver” 
is comforting and a touch haunting. The harmony 
of the duo’s voices holds something ancient within 
as the pair recalls the memories of those women 
who came before: “Look upon your mother and the 
silver in her hair / Consider it a crown the holiest 

may wear.” The song makes a point to acknowledge 
the sacrifices and abundant strength of mothers 
who have raised us, who have created the world we 
know by giving and nurturing life. “Silver,” the first 
song on the album, sets the tone of Saturn Return 
with its poetry and mix of ancient sentiment in a 
modern package. “Last night in my slumber came 
the matriarchs I miss / They said, ‘Do you wanna be 
anointed with age’s lasting kiss?’” The silver hair of 
years spent in motherly toil is a badge of honor. Here, 
the Secret Sisters find a little-uttered truth: That 
motherhood is a mark of the unyielding strength 
and devotion of womanhood. It does not have to 
be a mark of oppression, as it has been and can 
certainly be. Motherhood is more than childbearing 
–– it is the eternal connection between mother 
and daughter, and every ancestor and descendent 
stemming from them. 
“One is given wings and one gets more than she 
can bear / God in Heaven, can you tell me how that’s 
fair?” In the song “Fair,” The Secret Sisters weave 
a story of the lives of two very different women. 
Through circumstance, one lives a life of ease 
–– of good choices –– and the other a life of hard 
choices. They are united in their womanhood, their 
respective difficulties, despite the opposition of 
their paths. Here, again, men are absent from the 
narrative. One might guess that in the background 

lies the patriarchal system that has led to “frownin’ 
from the pages of hard times,” but there is no 
nefarious villain to conquer. There is simply life to 
be lived, in all its beautiful and terrible simplicity. 
What is most enduring, however, is the evident 
love between these two unnamed women. Their 
friendship does not seem tangible, but rather their 
affection is bound in the solidarity of their identities 
of shared womanhood. 
“Nowhere, Baby” is a short breath of fresh air. 
The Secret Sisters do lonesome journeys and somber 
ballads so well, but “Nowhere, Baby” takes a chance 
to celebrate self-validation and victory. “And it’s time 
I showed myself exactly what I am made of / And 
that’s not a cop out, not a dream drop, not a ‘close, but 
no cigar’”: Self-doubt is banished to embrace inner 
strength, courage, and determination. A tale of a 
woman who spent a lifetime climbing “nowhere,” it 
is hopeful rather than deprecating. Moreover, it is 
a universal narrative: Life and time gets away from 
us, and suddenly we’re stranded too far from the 
starting line to go back, and the finish line too far 
away to grasp. Womanhood is life –– yes, it can be 
unique, but The Secret Sisters do not shy away from 
normalizing shared narratives.

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

‘Babylon Berlin’ issues 
a dire warning to the U.S.
Revived ‘West Side Story’ 
puts new spin on ’50s classic

It’s finally happening. Americans at large are 
starting to realize that not all good television 
and cinema has to be in the English language. In 
this peculiar moment of our history, critics and 
audience members are finally starting to give 
notice to ”Babylon Berlin.” 
The show is a proper mystery noir in all 
the right ways. “Babylon Berlin” centers on 
the gruff, witty Gereon Rath (Volker Brunch, 
“Jerks”), a male detective who tries to navigate 
the gritty world of Berlin during the Weimar 
Era. With his accomplice, Charlotte Ritter (Liv 
Lisa Fries, “Prélude”), the two fight to bring the 
city’s most insidious murderers to justice. Their 
misadventures often put them in the crossfire 
between the Underworld and the Communists, 
and directly in the path of Nazis, who are trying 
to bring down the democratic government.
Season three mainly focuses on the death of 
Betty Winter Natalia Mateo, a talented actress 
murdered on an expensive set by a man described 
by the press as “Das Phantom.” Gereon and 
Charlotte desperately try to fight the Nazis within 
the ranks of the police department itself, some of 
whom are responsible for the sinister murder at 
the shocking conclusion of season two. As Gereon 
tries to bring all murders to justice, his love life 
continuously falls apart, and his sanity slips away. 
Much like Gereon’s internal mood, the city itself is 
leaning closer and closer to complete insanity: All 
these plot threads come to fruition in an explosive 
season finale, culminating in the stock market 

crash of 1929.
One of the greatest aspects of the show is 
the world itself. The world of “Babylon Berlin” 
is exceptional in embodying the plethora of 
contradictions of Weimar Berlin. We see the 
opulence of the rich combined with the misery of 
the poor, Nazi boy scouts and genderqueer clubs, 
vast improvements in technology coupled with 
blatant racism and sexism. Season three richly 
expands the multiplicitous world of Berlin beyond 
the confines of seasons one and two. Characters 
who served minor roles in previous seasons are 
finally given the depth and time they deserve. 
The show masterfully balances these new wild 
contradictions. In one moment, we empathize 
with a gay character struggling to navigate a 
hostile world. In the next moment, we see young, 
disenfranchised boys get enthralled by the 
community that Nazism provides. 
In all, the creators show that this time period 
is not dissimilar to our own. With the rise of 
radicalism and authoritarianism in the west, 
“Babylon Berlin” is a refreshingly relevant 
historical retelling. Since we know what will 
happen to Germany in the near future of the show, 
it’s a not-so-subtle warning that modern society 
is on the same path to make the same mistakes. 
The rampant rise of radicalism as a solution to 
the chaos of modern democracy is a consistent 
motif in this world. “Good police officers don’t 
take sides,” Gereon tells his nemesis in the final 
moments of the season. Season three of “Babylon 
Berlin” is the most explosive season to date. Not 
only is it absolutely thrilling, but the world of 
“Babylon Berlin” itself stands as a dire warning 
about society, for Germany and the United States.

Is it possible to revive a staple of the Broadway 
repertoire while staying true to the original 
production? And if not, should revivals instead 
strive to forge new ground? Is there a point at 
which a revival is too groundbreaking to be a 
revival, at which the revival must be understood 
as an entirely new creative product?
Over the past month, reviews of the current 
Broadway revival of “West Side Story” have 
fractured 
along 
these 
lines. 
Some 
have 
questioned the video projections, atypical 
staging and musical omissions that form much 
of this new work; others have spoken of the 
story’s revitalization thanks to these new 
creative decisions.
The 
recent 
production 
has 
also 
faced 
controversy over the casting of Amar Ramasar, 
who was removed and reinstated at the New 
York City Ballet over allegations of sexual 
misconduct. Protesters had been outside the 
theater during early performances of the work, 
which opened on Feb. 6. I saw no protesters at a 
performance that I attended this past Saturday.
This was not the first revival in recent years to 
take great liberties in reinterpreting a previous 
classic. 2019 saw a critically successful revival 
of “Oklahoma!,” a revival also dependent on 
limited scenery, wildly different orchestrations 
and live video projection. 
Yet in the “West Side Story” revival, I couldn’t 
help but feel that the projections and set design 
distracted from the Romeo and Juliet aspect 
of the story. The fantastical choreography that 
constituted much of the violence in the movie 
was instead presented literally and graphically 
magnified by the projections.
The different openings to these two versions 
of the show highlight the basic premises that 
have changed. In the movie, the battle between 
the Jets and the Sharks takes place against a 
light musical backdrop — the famous snapping at 
the beginning of the movie turning into precise 
underscoring, specific musical hits timed to 
match with the opening and closing of fists in 
an unbelievable, overly-choreographed manner. 
In this revival, the Jets and Sharks stand 
motionless at the front of the stage throughout 
the opening number. The only thing that moves 
is the camera, as the barely suppressed rage of 
the Jets and Sharks is projected on the back 

wall at fifty-foot dimensions. There was nothing 
light or remotely unbelievable about this scene.
This is not to say that director Ivan van 
Hove hasn’t added much to the audience’s 
understanding of the story. And this is not to 
say that the original “West Side Story” was not 
problematic in its own right. 
The movie’s casting of Latinx characters, 
for example, is frequently cited as an example 
of exactly what was wrong with 20th-century 
Hollywood. And questions over the show’s 
reliance on racial and gender stereotypes have 
long surrounded critical commentary on the 
work.
But despite its controversies, the original 
“West Side Story” aspires to be little more than a 
20th-century “Romeo and Juliet.” It is a fragile 
love story in the midst of a race-defined feud, a 
story of a beautiful love-turned-tragedy.
However, as I watched the revival, I couldn’t 
help but question whether this fundamental 
premise had been altered. Van Hove has spoken 
about how this revival was meant to reflect our 
current cultural and political divisions, to draw 
out the conflicts that have always existed under 
the work’s surface. 
Van Hove reaches for such large concepts — 
police brutality, sexual violence, racial conflict 
— that it feels as though Tony and Maria’s 
demise is merely a side story. I entered the 
theater knowing that (spoiler alert) they were 
going to fall in love and Tony was going to be 
killed. There was no suspension of disbelief, no 
suggestion that perhaps Tony and Maria might 
elope unscathed. 
When asked about the show’s originality, 
Scott Rudin, one of the show’s producers, said 
Van Hove “doesn’t direct revivals like they’re 
revivals. Because to him, they’re not... They’re 
brand-new to him.” And this led me back to my 
original question about originality. At what point 
could this no longer be considered a revival? 
Could it ever be understood as something new, 
a new work of theater based on source material 
called “West Side Story”?
It’s not as though the creativity of the work’s 
creators hasn’t already come under question. 
Many classical music aficionados have spoken 
of 
the 
resemblance 
between 
Bernstein’s 
“Somewhere” and the second movement of 
Beethoven’s “Piano Concerto No. 5” (the 
“Emperor” concerto) and/or Tchaikovsky’s 
“Swan Lake.”

Michigan sporting events, NCAA Tournament to be played without fans

As part of its action to combat 
the spread of COVID-19, the 
University announced Wednesday 
that it will be canceling all events 
on campus convening over 100 
people through April 21.
Per 
an 
official 
athletic 
department 
release, 
the 
ban 

extends to all U-M home athletic 
competitions. Those competitions 
will “be played as scheduled with 
only student-athletes, coaches, 
officials, essential personnel and 
a limit of two family members 
per participant in attendance,” 
according to the release.
“This is a rapidly evolving 
situation,” 
the 
release 
said. 
“U-M 
officials 
and 
medical 
experts, in close coordination 
with the state and local public 
health departments, are closely 

monitoring for developments and 
will offer additional guidance 
and messaging as soon as it is 
available.”
In addition to games, the 
Michigan football team’s annual 
open spring practice and the 
annual Big House 5K have both 
been cancelled. The status of 
the NCAA Men’s Gymnastics 
Championships, 
scheduled 
for April 17-18, and the CWPA 
Championships, scheduled for 
April 24-26, are both uncertain.

Due 
to 
the 
Ivy 
League 
cancelling all athletic events 
for the rest of the school year, 
additional affected events include 
the rowing team’s meet vs. 
Harvard and Yale on March 28 
as well as the water polo team’s 
games 
against 
Princeton 
on 
March 28, Brown on March 29,

personnel.

extend to off-campus recruiting 
trips, which will be halted until at 
least April 21.
Fans who held single-game 
tickets will be refunded by the 
University ticket office, while 
season ticket holders will be 
partially refunded.
Additionally, this weekend’s 
Big 
Ten 
Men’s 
Basketball 

Tournament 
will 
be 
played 
without fans starting on March 
12, contrary to previous plans that 
it would go ahead with fans. The 
NCAA Tournament will also be 
played without fans, starting as 
previously planned on March 17.
Michigan hockey’s Big Ten 
semifinal game in Columbus, Ohio 
on Sunday will also be played 
without spectators, after Ohio 
Gov. Mike DeWine announced an 
order that no fans will be allowed 
at games in the state.

Big Ten Tournament to be played 
without fans, locker rooms closed

This 
season’s 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament, taking place this 
week in Indianapolis, will be 
played with no fans. Rows of 
empty seats will greet this year’s 
conference teams in an attempt to 
slow the spread of COVID-19.
In addition, reporters will not be 
allowed to enter team locker rooms 
following games at this week’s Big 
Ten Tournament in Indianapolis, 
according to a statement from 
the Big Ten Conference. The 
statement, released Wednesday 
afternoon, confirmed that the 
tournament will “continue to 
be held as scheduled,” though 
postgame 
media 
availabilities 
will be held in a larger space in an 
attempt to avoid the close confines 
of locker rooms and fans will not 
be permitted to enter the facility.
The news comes amid a flurry 
of action in response to COVID-19 
— the virus just recently classified 
as a global pandemic by the World 

Health Organization.
Instead 
of 
locker 
room 
availabilities, postgame interviews 
will be held on the practice court 
at 
Bankers 
Life 
Fieldhouse. 
Following the game, coaches and 
players will be given a 10-minute 
“cooling-off period” in their locker 
room, during which they can 
decide to forego, use only a portion 
of the allotted time or remain in 
the locker room. Following the 
cooling-off period, each team is 
required to complete 20 minutes of 
media availability.
On a global scale, sporting 
events across the world have 
been either cancelled or played 
without fans due to the virus and 
the ensuing wave of alterations 
that has hit the U.S. The Big West 
and MAC announced Tuesday 
that their conference tournaments 
would be played with no fans.
The Big Ten has stated that 
the conference tournament will 
continue but will be played without 
fans and restricted media access to 
locker rooms at this time. The Ivy 
League canceled its tournament 
outright, along with spring sports.
“Our 
health 
is 
the 
most 

important thing,” Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard said Tuesday, “so 
we will sit down with our medical 
staff and see what’s the best way 
to move forward while preparing 
and preventing them from getting 
sick.”
The response to this disease is 
changing by the hour and the fate 
of the larger NCAA Tournament 
remains unclear. 
In attempts to quell the spread 
of the virus, experts suggest 
washing your hands with soap for 
at least 20 seconds, avoid touching 
your face and avoid close contact 
with people who are sick. In the 
case of players at this week’s Big 
Ten Tournament, similar person-
to-person adaptations will be 
made.
“I’m definitely going to keep my 
distance, not just fans but from a 
lot of people as far as the touching 
process,” senior point guard Zavier 
Simpson said. “I’m not sure who 
has it or anything. Just to be on the 
safe side, just wash my hands more 
frequently. Hopefully fans don’t 
take it as a negative if I happen to 
give them a fist instead of a high-
five.”

Hockey team preparing for empty 
arenas ahead of Big Ten semi-finals

Michigan’s 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament semifinal game 
on Sunday against Ohio State at 
Nationwide Arena in Columbus 
will be held without fans in a 
precautionary measure to limit 
the spread of COVID-19.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine 
is expected to announce an 
order limiting spectators at 
all sporting events in the state 
within the next 24-36 hours, 
which includes the Wolverines’ 
game on Sunday. This move 
adds 
force 
to 
DeWine’s 
recommendation 
from 
Tuesday that large gatherings 
be limited or eliminated. 
The Big Ten also released a 
statement Wednesday evening 
announcing they’ll be limiting 
attendance at all remaining 
conference competitions.
“Yeah, 
it’s 
worrisome,” 
senior forward Will Lockwood 
said. “I don’t want our season 
to come to an end. I really hope 
it doesn’t. I hope it doesn’t get 

to that point. Obviously there’s 
a reason they’re doing it, 
there’s a reason they’re taking 
precautions.”
As teams around the country 
are suspending their seasons 
— Harvard and Yale have 
both pulled out of their ECAC 
Tournament 
quarterfinal 
series, ending their seasons — 
Michigan is faced with a great 
deal of uncertainty. At this 
point, it’s unclear what’s going 
to happen in the coming days 
— as this story was written, 
the NBA went from playing 
games on Wednesday night to 
the season being suspended 
indefinitely. 
It’s a rapidly developing 
situation, but as of Wednesday 
night, the Big Ten hockey 
tournament is set to go ahead, 
though all remaining games 
will be played without fans. 
“I hope we get to play,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. 
“That’s 
all 
I 
wish. 
It doesn’t matter if it’s in 
Nationwide in front of nobody 
or it’s full. We’re on a mission. 
We’re going somewhere. They 

just happen to be our next 
opponent. Like I said, doesn’t 
matter if we have to create our 
own atmosphere and intensity, 
we can do that.” 
As for playing in a completely 
empty arena, the Wolverines 
are looking at it as a positive. 
They may have to create their 
own energy, but the arena also 
won’t be filled with opposing 
fans.
“I honestly think it works 
to our advantage a little bit,” 
Lockwood said. “They won’t 
be able to have a home crowd 
advantage 
and 
have 
their 
fans there, not that it’s really 
impacted us. We’ve been pretty 
good on the road this year, but 
it’s something we can’t really 
focus on too much.”
Added Pearson: “We know 
it’s a huge challenge, but it’s a 
great opportunity for us and 
that’s how we’re approaching 
it. There’s so many things you 
can’t control. … We’re just 
focusing on being ready and 
being able to control our own 
destiny. That’s all you can ask 
for in sports.”
