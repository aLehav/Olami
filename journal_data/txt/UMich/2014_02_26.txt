Members of the Student Union of Michigan gather in the lobby of the Fleming Administration Building Tuesday to protest the University's sexual misconduct
policies and other issues.
Stu dents march on Fleming

Protesters chastize
administration
in wake of sexual
misconduct case
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
Chants heard across the Diag
on Tuesday afternoon demon-
strated that some students are
"fed up" with the University.
The Student Union of Michi-
gan hosted a protest to voice
concerns about the administra-
tion's handling of sexual mis-
conduct cases on campus. About

30 students and members of
the community marched from
Rackham Auditorium to the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing, chanting and distributing
pamphlets to onlookers.
Students from the group
delivered speeches at both
Rackham and Fleming, which
outlined the group's concerns
and suggested changes that
could be made to administrative
policies. While several issues
were addressed, the majority of
the protest revolved around the
administration's lack of effort to
improve campus climate, which
members of SUM said promotes
"rape culture" and "victim
blaming," while protecting the

personal financial interests of
administrators.
Although several references
were made to the recent contro-
versy surroundingformer kicker
Brendan Gibbons' permanent
separation from the University,
Rackham student Laura Her-
bert said the group supports the
survivor's right to privacy and
the University's decision to keep
certain information about the
case private.
"We're hearing the same
line of rhetoric," Herbert said.
"They're telling us that because
they can't divulge private mat-
ters to us as a student body, they
can't do anything about the rape
culture on campus. That's not

true."
Herbert said the administra-
tion has many opportunities to
improve campus climate within
the constraints of laws regard-
ing the privacy of sexual assault
victims. In particular, she called
for public forums where stu-
dents can speak about their
concerns and a mandate for Uni-
versity athletic staff to receive
training on how to handle cases
of sexual misconduct involving
students.
Following a mandate from
the Department of Education in
2011, the University reformed
its sexual misconduct policy to
comply with new federal regu-

Office for Civil Rights
will look into whether
sexual assault cases
were mishandled
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily NewsoEditor
The U.S. Department ofEdu-
cation Office for Civil Rights
will investigate the University's
response to a Title IX complaint
concerning a 2009 sexual mis-
conduct case involving former
kicker Brendan Gibbons.
The Michigan Daily reported
on Jan. 28 that Gibbons was per-
manently separated from the
University after violating the
University's Sexual Misconduct
Policy, according to documents
reviewed by the Daily.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed the Univer-
sity was notified of the investiga-
tion Monday night.
"We're very proud of our stu-
dent sexual misconduct policy,

our prevention efforts and our
programs to support survivors of
sexual misconduct," Fitzgerald
said in a statement. "We will fully
cooperate with the Department
of Education and we believe that
a review of our policy, programs
and investigations will conclude
that the University of Michigan
is doing what it should in this
important area."
A letter from the OCR to Doug
Smith, a former University pro-
fessor who has been vocal against
the University as information
about the Gibbons case has sur-
faced, said it will investigate
Smith's complaint about the case.
Smith issued his complaint in
August 2013, accusing the Uni-
versity of failing to respond in a
timely manner to a rape incident
at a fraternity house thatinvolved
a female University student and
two University football players.
Jim Bradshaw, a spokesman
for the Department of Education,
said no other information can
be confirmed by the OCR at this
point regarding the details of the

SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY
Big Ten schools
undergo similar
policy changes

Title IX coordinator
implemented at
universities under
new guidelines
ByJACK TURMAN
DailyStaffReporter
While the U.S. Department of
Education Office for Civil Rights
commences its investigation
regarding a Title IX complaint
lodged against the University,
other Big Ten schools are also
grappling with the implementa-
tion of revised sexual misconduct
guidelines.
In April 2011, the OCR released
a Dear Colleague Letter that
required universities to modify
their sexual harassment policies
codified by Title IX of the Educa-
tion Amendments of 1972.
Under the new mandate, uni-
versities are required to have a
Title IX coordinator who is in
charge of "overseeing Title IX
complaints and identifying and
addressing any patterns or sys-

temic problems that arise during
the review of such complaints."
The changes require uni-
versities to actively investigate
instances of sexual misconduct
rather than wait for survivors to
bring allegations forward.
Like many other universities,
after implementing an interim
policybased onthe recommenda-
tions, the University revised its
sexual misconduct policy in 2013.
The letter includes mandates, but
leaves some leeway for institu-
tions to craft their own policies.
Though universities are
required to implement many of
the same changes due to risk of
losing federal funding, one of the
main differences is the extent to
which the operation is central-
ized.
In an e-mail interview, Gary
Lewis, senior director of media
and public relations at Ohio State
University, said certain univer-
sity offices have the power to
investigate cases under their
jurisdiction.

Lecture discusses
importance of
broad education

An outsider's perception of
the life of a medical student
likely consists of a tedious
courseload and hours spent
memorizing facts and process-

aside, more experiences out-
side of alab lie ahead for those

aspiring to become a healthcare
professional.
In a lecture Tuesday, Joseph
Kolars, senior associate dean
for education and global ini-

emphasized the development
of a curriculum that produces
socially aware students. The
lecture occurred as part of a
series of town hall meetings

The town hall series exists
to allow the community to

take part in discussions about
important issues related to
the Medical School and offer
a variety of perspectives on
changes that will affect them.
Tuesday's meeting was the fifth
in the series, which was first
announced in the fall.
Kolars said this lecture was
focused on advising professors
to step back and reconsider the
central ideas of success within
the Medical School before
developing a new curriculum.

sexual misconduct policy,"
according to a CSG press release.
"Periodic, regular review of
records of resolution actions will
be made available, in confidence,
to the Code of Conduct Advisory
Board Chair of CSG," the
Statement reads. The Statement
was last updated on July 1, 2013.
However, the University
interpreted this clause in the
statement differently.
"The University stated that
the sexual misconduct policy
did not fall under the Statement,
meaning that they felt as ifI
our access to the documents is
invalidated," Dishell said. "Prior
to that meeting, that distinction
was not clear."
Keeney said the taskforce hasI
evidence that CSG had access
in the past to cases dealing with
sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment. However, these instances
were subject to the 2009 sexual
misconduct policy and a similarly
older Statement, not the new one.
Still, Keeney argued the policies
were "close enough" that CSG
should be granted access to the
Gibbons documents.
OSCR Director Jay Wilgus
said the Statement has a "cut-
out" where all potential sexual
misconduct violations will
now follow the Student Sexual
Misconduct policy.
The taskforce is now
working with Kirkland & Ellis,
an international law firm, to
determine whether or not there is
a direct correlation between the
statement and sexual misconduct
policy - and ultimately whether
or not the University has the right
to withhold OSCR documents
from the taskforce.
CSG President Michael
Proppe, a Business junior, said
the Department of Education's
investigation might push back
the timeline of the taskforce's
investigation, whose work will
be'ongoing despite its inability to
obtain University documents.
"The Department of Ed., I'm
guessing, is going to take a bit
of a priority, but we're going to
continue," Proppe said.

Prof. Megan
Sweeney uses
literature to teach
social change
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
Associate Prof Megan Swee-
ney remembered Payne Hiraldo
as a shy fourth grader from New
York City's Washington Heights,
a girl she mentored and taught
more than 20 years ago at P.S. 128
Elementary School.
Last December, Sweeney
learned her student - the girl
whose family she got to know,
whose first Holy Communion she
attended - earned her master's
degree from the University of
Vermont. Hiraldo now works at
the University of Maryland, Col-
lege Park as a residence director.
"Once I found you and had
the opportunity to look at your
CV, it felt great to know that you
yourself went off to become an
professor, get tenure and become
a director," Hiraldo wrote in an
e-mail to Sweeney. "It is very
inspiring. You serve as a remind-
er of what I would like to do and
where my passion lies."
And Sweeney herself - who
serves as an associate profes-
sor with joint appointment in
the Departments of English
Language and Literature and
Afroamerican and African
Studies, as a faculty affiliate in
Women's Studies and American
Culture and director of under-
graduate studies in the DAAS -
continues to teach.
These kinds of reconnections
are common for Sweeney, recent-
ly named an Arthur F. Thurnau
professor in recognition of her
work in undergraduate teaching.
Even though she's teaching semi-
nars in race and gender instead of
how to multiply fractions, Swee-
ney said she values relationships
with former students.
"That's a teacher's dream to

hear back from a long time ago
and see who they've become and
keep that connection," Sweeney
said. "It can be emotional at the
end of the semester whenyou feel
like you don't know how often
you'll see your students, but I've
actually been fortunate and been
able to keep in touch with alot of
my students over time, and that
matters to me a lot."
Sweeney's rdsum4 reflects
a hodgepodge of community
involvement between receiving
her B.A. at Northwestern in 1989
and M.A. from Penn State in 1997.
Among her former positions are
as a caretaker for children afflict-
ed with AIDS in Houston, an arts
and education facilitator in aMis-
sissippi town where 20 percent
of families live on incomes of
less than $10,000 per year and a
seamstress in a factory near Bos-
ton. Sweeney recalls listening to
the life stories of her factory co-
workers - including a Japanese
woman who lost her arm and
young women from the area who
were already mothers.
She said some of the most
inspiring stories came from the
female prisoners she met when
working as a book club facilita-
tor and GED tutor at the North
Carolina Correctional Institution
for Women, awomen's prison and
halfway home where recently
released prisoners work to read-
just to society.
Sweeney remembers a
42-year-old prisoner named Sissy
as being particularly inspiring.
Sissy used books and art as away
to understand the world beyond
her upbringing in Mississippi,
where she encountered racism
and substance abuse, as well as
abusive and violent relationships.
"She has been unfathomably
creative in trying to educate
herself and stay connected to
the world around her," Sweeney
said. "Reading has helped her to
understand people whose expe-
riences and backgrounds are dif-
ferent than hers. The materials
that are available to prisoners are
so paltry."

Sweeney later featured Sissy
and others in two books. "Read-
ing Is My Window: Books and
the Art of Reading in Women's
Prisons," which won the 2011
Emily Toth Award for Best Single
Work in Women's Studies, a 2010
PASS Award from the National
Council of Crime and Delinquen-
cy and an Honorable Mention for
the 2011 GloriaE. Anzalddia Book
Award, examines how prisoners
like Sissy use reading to come
to terms with their pasts. "The
Story Within Us: Women Prison-
ers Reflect on Reading" shares
interviews with 11 such women.
"She is somebody that will
probably never leave prison but
she's made alife of herself and it's
alife ofthe mind,"Sweeney said.
The courses Sweeney teaches,
like the issues she explored when
interviewing female prisoners,
concern race and gender. She has
also taught courses on social jus-
tice and community engagement.
In her classes, students analyze
topics through film, novels and
history, such as that of the Black
experience in America in the
20th and 21st centuries.
"The work that I've done with
all different types of groups has
made me realize how differently
our experiences are shared by
race, culture, gender, nationality,
by things that are not just theo-
retical concepts," Sweeney said.
"They deeply shape our experi-
ence and our history in the U.S.
and everywhere."
Rebecca Pickus, a graduate
student in the School of Social
Work, took Sweeney's English
398 course, "Reading 'the Black
Body' in 2oth/21st-Century
American Literature and Cul-
ture" as an undergraduate stu-
dent in 2009. One novel she read
in the course, "Invisible Man" by
Ralph Ellison, endedupbeingthe
topic of Pickus' undergraduate
honors thesis, which Sweeney
advised.

was initially vague, and Sweeney

Health officials
weigh in on hard
liquor regulation

of students report academic
consequences from drinking

Greek life's decision
to only permit beer
at large parties well-
received by UHS
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
Fraternities will no longer
serve hard liquor at open parties,
and the University Health Ser-
vice professionals are on board.
On Jan. 19, the Interfrater-
nity Council implemented a rule
banning hard liquor at open
fraternity parties, effective
immediately. Under this dis-
tinction, any fraternity parties
larger than a mixer will only be
allowed to serve beer. If they do
not comply, they run the risk of
being sanctioned by the IFC.
UHS Director Robert A.
Winfield, the University's chief
health officer, said beer is pref-
erable to hard alcohol because
of the slower speed of absorp-
tion by the body. While beer has
similar intoxicating effects to
vodka, it takes 12 oz. of beer to
get the same alcohol content as
a standard 1.5 oz. shot. Due to
the significantly larger volume,
Winfield said people tend to
drink beer much slower.
"When you drink a shot, you
do that in about five seconds,
then you have alcohol in your
stomach, and it's all there to be
absorbed, so it's going to get into
the bloodstream faster," Win-
field said. "Now, if you drink a
beer, usually you'll drink a beer
over a period of time, which
means the alcohol will be put
into your stomach more slowly,
so it's going to be absorbed more

lations. l4erbert said this demon-
strated that the University was
only willing to change its policy
under threat of financial penalty.
She added that students might
not understand why the poli-
cy changed and suggested the
administration could do more to
educate students about the nature
of the new policy.
"These are real changes we
could make to make our commu-
nity safer," Herbert said.
The Student Union questioned
Michigan coach Brady Hoke's
involvement in the events sur-
rounding Gibbons separation
from the University. SUM alleged
Hoke knew about the permanent
separation, but created an alibi
when asked about Gibbons' status
at a Dec. 23 press conference prior
to the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl.
"We do not know how Brady
Hoke possibly could have not
known about the separation
before he called the expulsion a
'family matter,"' SUM wrote in
a statement. "We find the injury

slowly."
Winfield added that with
slower absorption rates, the
negative experiences students
may have with alcohol, such as
memory loss and alcohol poison-
ing, will likely decrease.
"With vodka, you run the risk
of drinking so quickly that you
could get way more intoxicated
than you intend," Winfield said.
"That's the kind of thing that,
in general, gets associated with
behaviors that people regret -
blackout, non-consensual sex,
vomiting, behaving in a way
that's embarrassing yourself."
Christina Gerazounis, health
educator for the Wolverine Well-
ness program, agreed that beer
is the safer choice, adding that
students tend to drink too much
vodka in part due to its wide
availability at Greek events.
"I think that access and avail-
ability is huge in this," Gerazou-
nis said. "Limiting liquor is a
must on campus."
While the new limitation will
not restrict football Saturday
pregame events, Gerazounis
said it is dangerous when stu-
dents drink early on a Satur-
day morning because alcohol
from the night before will likely
remain in their blood. Alco-
hol leaves the blood at a rate of
roughly .015 percent of blood
alcohol concentration per hour.
Gerazounis said there are many
myths on how to get sober - cof-
fee, water, a cold shower - but
sobriety only comes with time.
"Students say, 'I don't know
how I got so out of hand, I only
had two drinks,' but what we
recognize is that they went to
bed at 4 a.m. and they still had
alcohol in their system," Gera-
zounis said. "When they wake up

University president Mary Sue
Coleman released a statement on
Jan. 30 stating that the athletic
department' "has no influence
over sexual misconduct investiga-
tions or the academic standing of
student athletes."
At a Wednesday press confer-
ence, Hoke said he could not dis-
cuss the matter and had not been
made aware of the student pro-
test. Similarly to past comments
by the University, Hoke said fed-
eral privacy laws preventing him
from discussingthe topic.
"Like I said before, I... can't say
anything," Hoke said. "You know,
I don't like that, but I can't."
Business junior Sumana Palle,

administrators at the University
placed greater value on financial
factors than the safety of students

"There's no way to right this

gated by Human Resources,"
Lewis wrote. "If the respondent/
accused person is a student, the
case will be investigated by Stu-
dent Conduct."
The University of Wisconsin-
Madison employs a similar sys-
tem.
Luis Pifiero, assistant vice
chancellor for workforce equity
and diversity, Title IX coordina-
tor and director of the school's
Office for Equity and Diversity,
said its investigation process also
relies on multiple offices.
"We have a system that is
decentralized in some ways
because the student's issues go in
one place and the employee issues
go in another place," Pifiero said.
He added that the Division of
Student Life, which includes the
office of the Dean of Students,
investigates student-against-stu-
dent cases.
Within this division,. Pifie-

ro said a judicial affairs unit
enforces the Student Code of
Conduct, which sets standards
for student behavior. The Office
for Equity and Diversity investi-
gates allegations in cases such as
employee-against-employee and
employee-against-student.
He said that assigning only
one person to deal with the
entire spectrum of allegations
would not be effective with such
a large student body and campus.
Additionally, working with the
Division of Student Life ensures
Title IX requirements are ful-
filled.
"We work collaboratively with
them and we also provide them
advice to make sure that the way
they are conducting their inves-
tigation fulfills the expectations
under Title IX," Pifiero said.
In contrast, Michigan State
University's Office for Inclu-
sion and Intercultural Initia-
tives receives all allegations. At
the University of Michigan, the
Office of Institutional Equity
receives all claims.
While universities have an

obligation to investigate all sexual
harassment cases under the Title
IX guidelines, situations in which
a student survivor does not want
the university to pursue an inves-
tigation requires a case-by-case
analysis.
Paulette Granberry Russell,
Michigan State's senior adviser to
the president for diversity, Title
IX coordinator and director of the
Office for Inclusion and Intercul-
tural Initiatives, said if this were
to occur, the office would initiate
contact with the student.
"We will invite them to come
in and meet with us," Russell said.
"The student can then decide if
they are going to participate in
the process."
If the student opts to not par-
ticipate in the investigation pro-
cess, the office then evaluates
whether to continue the investi-
gation. At the University of Michi-
gan, there is a panel in place that
reviews the case and determines
how to proceed.
On Monday, the Department
of Education confirmed the OCR
has also initiated an investiga-

tion of Michigan State's sexual
misconduct policy after a com-
plaint was lodged.
At OSU, Lewis said it depends

"The university will do a

there may be opportunities for
informal interventions that will

tion and Title IX."
While the Dear Colleague
Letter required universities to
revise their sexual harassment
policies, it also allowed universi-
ties to provide students, faculty
and staff with educational and
resource opportunities regard-

Changing Greek party culture
The University should better educate students on alcohol dangers
n Wednesday, Feb. 19, the Interfraternity Council amended its Social
Environment Management Policy to ban hard liquor at Tier IIIA
and IIIB parties. These registered open parties typically include
the members of the fraternity and are limited to 200 guests, and often have
crowds that are harder to control than lower-tier parties. The new policy
may help foster a cultural shift toward a safer party scene, and it is indicative
of an IFC and larger student body with a vested interest in student safety
and conscientious alcohol use. However, the University should do more
to better protect its students and foster a more responsible party culture.

is unfathomable given the polar
vortexes and all - and occasionally
gets to stay in a hotel thanks to the
generosity of the owner. A struggle
for survival, indeed.
The experience, though only a
couple of minutes, was humbling and
gave me the smallest glimpse into
what homeless life is like. In a world
where my biggest worry is about how
I may have done on the exam I just
took, here is a woman who needs to
beg for the help of others to survive.
Truly eye-opening.
While many people have also
decided to help the homeless in
their communities - notably in Ann
Arbor - through Feed the Deed,
other deeds that have been done such
as passing out motivational notes
to other students, making midterm
survival kits and donating to various
organizations. There is no doubt
that Feed the Deed has brought the
emphasis on good deeds back into
the spotlight - as sad as that is to say.
So from that perspective, I have no
complaints, and it will be an aspect I
address later on.

themselves doing good things,
which is why I chose not to do that.
The wordswere enough for me. But,
it was also part of the activity, so
I digress.
There is something to be said
about the intricate relationship
between goodness and anonymity.
For example, helping the elderly lady
across the street when no one else is
watching, and she never learns your
name. To me, that is goodness. Feed
the Deed has become something you
do to prove you are capable of helping
others, which is also a good thing
in its own right and by no means
is this saying that those who do it
are bad people whatsoever. It's just
important how we classify it.
I had a conversation with a friend
of mine questioning this point of
classification, because the other
day he gave money to a homeless
man without a Feed the Deed
nomination looming. We discussed
whether motivations even matter
because whether it was through
Feed the Deed or not, the homeless
man was still

If enforced, this amendment has potential to
curb dangerous drinking on campus. According
to the National Institutes of Health, 1,825 college
students die annually due to alcohol-related
incidents. An estimated 599,000 more students
are injured while under the influence and
690,000 are assaultedby a student who has been
drinking. The risk of being involved in a sexual
assault also increases when alcohol is involved.
According to a study published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, nearly
half of binge drinkers reported experiencing
more than five drinking-related problems in one
year. A study published in2002 in the Journal of
Studies on Alcohol reported 31 percent of college
students met the criteria for alcohol abuse.While
drinking is an undeniable part of college culture,
banning hard liquor from large parties may help
preventinjury or death. This is a proactive step in
the promotion of campus safety, and in the long-
term may even help change campus culture by
deglamorizing dangerous drinking.
The new ban should be expanded to include
otherlargeparties.IFCPresidentTommyWydra,
an LSA junior, said in an interview with the
Daily that he has "absolutely no plans to expand
it to Tier II or Tier IICs." Tier It parties have a
limit of 100 guests and Tier IICs are limited to
200 but are hosted by more than one fraternity.
Parties with 100 guests may still get easily out of
control, and monitoring a large group for signs
and symptoms of alcohol overdose is not easy,
despite the presence of trained sober monitors.
Additionally, by not extending the ban to larger
parties hosted by more than one fraternity,
the IFC is openly ignoring many of Greek life's
larger events. Not extending the ban to parties

with more than one host is self-serving, and the
safety of partygoers should not be ignoredsimply
because the liability and risk are more dispersed.
While this policy takes a step in the right
direction, the University needs to hold
fraternities accountable to following the law
and enforcing their existing policies and rules.
Licensedbars are highly regulated to ensure that
alcohol is not served to minors. While fraternity
parties do not sell alcohol, they do host a large
number of people. More needs to be done to
promote legal compliance.
Promoting student safety and changing
the college culture of drinking is not the sole
responsibility of the IFC. The University
needs to be more proactive in educating its
students on alcohol safety. Currently, the only
mandatory alcohol educational process for
non-Greek members is an online program
called AlcoholEdu that students complete
their freshman year. While this may be a
good first step, further education is needed to
ensure that students feel safe and confident in
their abilities to make responsible decisions.
Proper, comprehensive alcohol education isthe
best way to change the culture of dangerous
binge drinking at college parties. One way
this education could be formatted is in a
facilitated, dialogue-based seminar, similar to
Relationship Remix, which students attend
freshman year. Education should be continued
for all four years as students' habits change.
Rather thancreatingpolicies thatstop alcohol
consumption completely, it is more important
to change the culture of campus by having safer
parties. The University has the potential to build
its reputation by stepping in andtaking action.

people to go
out and do something nice for their
community, post about it on their
social networks and then nominate
their friends to do so too, usually
within24 to 48 hours.
The initiative ofFeed the Deed has
a very interesting origin. A drinking
game called Neknominate became
popular atthe end oflast year. Similar
to Feed the Deed, it involved people
recording themselves chugging
copious amounts of alcohol, posting
the video on their social networks
and then nominating their friends to
do the same. At the end of January, a
SouthAfricannamed BrentLindeque
was neknominated. Instead of
attempting the drinking challenge,
however, he bought a sandwich and
delivered it to a homeless man on
the side of the road. The video was
then seen by Canadians Josh Stern
and Russell Citron, who teamed
up to spread the initiative through
Kindness Counts, the nonprofit that
Citron runs.
For my own Feed the Deed, I
had an encounter on State Street
with a homeless lady who asked
me for some money to buy food. I
have always simply walked past
homeless people on the street, but
this time - with the nomination in
mind - I decided to help. Instead of
handing over cash though, I said I
would buy her some food. She asked
for a Jimmy John's BLT, which I
then bought and brought back to
her. I was met with a thank you and
"God bless." I responded by asking
her about how she is able to get
by every day. She told me how she

Leaving the savior mentality behind

UNITED COALITION FOR RACIAL JUSTICE I
Not your Victors

s the countdown to Spring
Break gets smaller and
smaller, I cannot wait to

At last Thursday's University's Board of
Regent's meeting, University President Mary
Sue Coleman proclaimed that "great struggles
occur at great universities," while members
of the #BBUM movement sat in the front row
with duct tape over their mouths, symbolizing
the University's silencing of Black students.
Coleman's remarks were a Janus-faced affair
of culpability and triumph, complicity and
victimhood. On the one hand, the University
of Michigan has "struggled in the wake of
Proposal 2." On the other, "universities look to
us to develop new solutions." At the University,
"commitment has never waned," yet we "haven't
always gotten it right through the decades."
Cappingthis rhetorical diversity dance, a choral
group sang"Hail totthe Victors" to a roompacked
full of protesters addressing the University's
low minority enrollment, poor racial climate
and growing class inequality. Without irony,
Coleman delivered a disjointed speech which
both lauded the University's leadership and all
but admitted its utter inadequacy. Her farcical
remarks were capped with a bizarre and jarring
chorus of triumph.
The logic put forth by Coleman was as
incoherent as the rhetoric was empty. So what
allows the University to enumerate its myriad
shortcomings while simultaneously trumpeting
the triumphant narrative of the Victors? The
answer takes two forms. First, the University
co-opts student movements. The University
strategically repackages the legacy of student
activism as a part of its triumphant narrative
about the University as a nationwide leader in
diversity. Second, the University nonsensically
trumpets that very narrative despite increasing
evidence to undermine it.
The history of student activism on campus
is an important one, but can be claimed only
by the students who forged these paths.
The institution can only claim to have
been the impetus of these protests, not its
torchbearers. In 1968 when students took
over an administration building after Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, they helped
establish what is now the Department of
Afroamerican and African Studies. The 1970
strike initiated by the Black Action Movement
led to the University's first aiming for a goal of
10 percent Black enrollment. The 1987 sit-in by
the United Coalition Against Racism forced a
reluctant University to issue Nelson Mandela
an honorary degree, close for MLK Day and
eventually draft the Michigan Mandate - a

comprehensive and flexible plan to increase
diversity among students and faculty. In all of
these cases, students led and the University
followed. The point at which the University can
claim to be an inclusive and diverse institution
is a fleeting one in a long history of isolation and
unmet promises. We must create a movement
that cannot be absorbed, appropriated and
repackaged under the banner of the Victors.
There is a legacy to be claimed here, but we
must make sure that the students, and not the
administration, rightfully claim it.
The co-optation of student movements is
especially damaging when it bolsters the false
idea that the University has historically been a
safe and inclusive place for students, staff and
faculty of color. That notion is shoddy history.
Coleman can tell us that the University leads in
diversity and support for students color. Provost
Martha Pollack can tell us that the problem is
only a few years old. But too often the popular
Prop 2 narrative elides the true history. A 2008
report called Opportunity Adrift, released by
a nonprofit advocacy group, found that the
University of Michigan ranked in the bottom
quartile in minority student access and success.
It listed the University along with Indiana
University as one of two institutions to receive
"the lowest overall marks for performance
and progress." Furthermore, it was one of only
six nationwide whose ranking had dropped
from 2005 to 2008. Schools do not look to the
University as a model in diversity and this is not
a new problem. Students have long come to this
conclusion. It is time this administration does so
as well.
The University would like to think that it can
simply rebrand itself through new hires, new
positions, and new initiatives. But at this point,
the current administration has lost what little
credibility it had. If Coleman will not deliver
anything more than empty rhetoric, President-
elect Mark Schlissel must take a stand. Until
proven otherwise, his silence stands as a
tacit endorsement for this administration's
inaction. As Barbara Ransby, former United
Coalition Against Racism activist, told a crowd
of over 1,000 at the Speak Out in the Shapiro
Undergraduate Library last Tuesday, students
must continue to be "the conscience of this
institution." Now it is time for the institution to
demonstrate that it has one.

Service trips have become
somewhat of a trend at the University,
whether one participates through
Alternative SpringBreak, Foundation

or your own student organization.
Some of these trips are domestic, as
close as Detroit, others international,
going to various countries in South
America. I have heard incredible
testimonials of those who choose to

I also know that many of these

they do not feel that they are saving

that not all individual participants

L.A. rapper releases
long-awaited
'Oxymoron'
By JOSH FRAZIER
DailyArts Writer
The long-awaited major label
debut from West Coast rapper
Schoolboy Q paints a comprehen-
sive picture of
the Los Angeles B+
gang scene, yet
the album falls O)ymoron
short of meet-
ing its lofty SchoolboyQ
expectations. Ttp aag
Oxymoron isEteptawgn
the first studio Enlertainment
album released
by Top Dawg Entertainment
since the 2012 release of good
kid, m.A.A.d city by labelmate
Kendrick Lamar. Schoolboy Q is
the logical successor to Lamar,
the second-in-command at one
of the most in-demand labels in
rap. His latest full-length effort
falls short of the high standard
set by Lamar3 last album" but is
a worthwhile listen in its own
right.
Schoolboy Q draws on his own
life experiences to weave togeth-
er a vivid tapestry of street life,
with tales of drug dealing and
human temptation. Q attempts
to balance hood-friendly bangers
with more introspective, per-
sonal confessions. Oxymoron
reaches its highest points when

Q turns inward, ruminating on
religion, morality and drug use.
His narrative-driven songs are
interspersed with snippets of his
young daughter's voice, which
juxtaposes his criminal lifestyle
with his good intentions for his
family. It's a compelling portrait
of a conflicted man attempting to
find his place in this world.
Q is at his best when he shares
his inner psyche over the course
of Oxymoron's 15 tracks. Songs
like "Prescription-Oxymoron"
and "Blind Threats" are obvious
standouts that are thoughtful
meditations on life. Creative sto-
rytelling strengthens "His and
Her Fiend," which features Q
rapping from the perspective of
an Oxycontin pill. Other tracks
showcase Schoolboy Q's versa-
tility, as he switches his point of
view from that of a drug dealer
and pimp to that of a nurturing
father.
Oxymoron features industry
heavyweights behind the pro-
duction and as featured guests.
A-listers like Lamar, 2 Chainz
and Raekwon deliver stellar guest
verses,"ad beats are provided
by hitmakers like Pharrell, The
Alchemist and Mike Will Made
It. Despite this star-studded cast
of characters, Oxymoron does not
deliver top-shelf results. School-
boy Q's rhyme schemes often
feel simplistic and border on
redundancy in many songs. The
Pharrell-produced track, "Los
Awesome," sees Q's voice over-
powered by the beat's thumping

baseline.
Unfortunately, the album has
too many lowpoints to make it a
consistently rewarding listen. At
his best, Schoolboy Q is one of the
most entertaining rappers in the
game, but Oxymoron has far too
many clunkers. Despite energetic
bangers like "Break the Bank"
and "Man of the Year," the album
is plaguedby filler. A tighter track
list would dramatically improve
the Oxymoron listening experi-
ence, as the album loses steam as
it goes along. The last two songs
are among the weakest on the
album; removing those tracks,
in addition to the dull "Hoover
Street" and the lackluster "Stu-
dio," would make Oxymoron one
of the best rap albums of the last
several years. As it stands, how-
ever, the finished product is still a
solid release, just not the modern-
day classic Q made it out to be.
It's not Schoolboy Q's fault
that Oxymoron will draw inevi-
table comparisons to good kid,
m.A.A.d city, which also fea-
tured a conflicted young man
describing life in Los Angeles.
Schoolboy Q hascreated a very
good rap album, but he wants to
be considered as one of the best.
On "Break the Bank," Q raps "tell
Kendrick move from the throne
/ I came for it." Oxymoron won't
convince anyone that Schoolboy
Q is a bigger star than Lamar, but
it is a promising release from an
entertaining rapper, and another
worthwhile offering from Top
Dawg Entertainment.

arvin Gaye, Ste-
vie Wonder, The
Supremes, The
Temptations, Diana Ross,
The Jackson 5 - all of these
renowned
artists came
together to
create one
of Detroit's
namesakes:
The Motown
Sound.
Motown PAIGE
Records was PFLEGER
founded by
Barry Gordy
in 1959, in the midst of racial
tumult in the city of Detroit.
Falling between the race riots
of 1943 and the riots of 1967, the
creation of Motown infiltrated
the white-dominated omusic
industry with a soulful pop
sound.
Berry Gordy started off open2
ing a record shop dedicated to
jazz music in 1953, and it soon
closed due to lack of a market.
After opening Motown Records,
he hired unemployed jazz musi-
cians from the area to form his
in-house band, the Funk Broth-
ers. Gordy's business model was
made to replicate the assembly
line process Ford had adopted
for making cars, but Gordy
used it to crank out hits. His
idea was that an African Amer-
ican kid off the streets could
walk into the Hitsville U.S.A.
offices as an unknown, and
emerge from the other side a
star.
In the early days, the beauty
of Motown music wasn't being
seen - it was merely being lis-
tened to. As Gordy developed
the Motown sound, he pur-
posefully shielded the race
of the performers from radio
disc jockeys and other poten-
tial markets for the music to
prevent racism holding the
music back. Gordy carried this
out was by hiding the identity
of the artists on the record's
album cover art, as most of
Motown's earlier albums dis-
played a variation of geomet-
ric patterns as opposed to
the faces of the performers.
It wasn't until the musicians
gained popularity among a
young white audience that
Gordy allowed the artists to
be revealed as African Ameri-
cans, and the Motown sound
grew into a dynasty - one of
the most successful African
American owned and run busi-
nesses of the time.
Today, the immense history
of the evolution of Motown
can be seen in full in one place:
Hitsville U.S.A., Motown's

first headquarters on West
Grand Boulevard in Detroit.
The white building sits back
on a grassy lawn with a mas-
sive sign stuck in it that reads
"Motown Museum." Its win-
dow frames and doors are
painted blue, and a sign spans
the length of the house says
Hitsville U.S.A. in cursive let-
ters. Upstairs are Barry Gordy's
old living quarters, and down-
stairs is the infamous Studio
A. Right next to the studio is a
candy machine that still holds
Stevie Wonder's favorite candy
bar, a Baby Ruth, in it's cus-
tosuary spot fourth from the
right so Wonder always knew
where to find it.
The house was converted
into a museum in 1985 after
Motown had moved to Los
Angeles. Esther Gordy, Berry's
sister, woke up one morning,
looked out the window and saw
people lined up on her lawn,
snapping pictures of the place
where Motown began. She
called up her husband in L.A.
and told him, "I think we made
history, and we didn't even
know it." The conversion from
house to museum was easy -
leave everything exactly as it
was, including a Kool-Aid mug
on the kitchen counter and
Wonder's favorite candy bar.
It's joined to a brick house next
door, formerly the publishing
office, which is now home to
hundreds of Motown artifacts,
among them photos, records,
one of Michael Jackson's fedo-
ras and his white studded right
hand glove that he wore the
first time he performed the
moonwalk.
For Detroit native Anto-
nio Dandridge, the Motown
dynasty has shaped the entirety
of his life. When he was three
years old, Dandridge told his
mom he wanted to sing, and not
only that - he wanted to sing
Motown music.
"The way the Motown sing-
ers made me feel was the way
that I wanted to make my audi-
ence feel when I performed,"
Dandridge said. "It's a great
story to tell, because they didn't
have anything, and they made
something out of nothing."
Dandridge began visiting the
museum when he was seven
and has gone consistently ever
since. He followed through on
his word and traveled around
the globe singing Motown
music. When he returned three
years ago, Dandridge became
a museum docent and changed
the style of the tours through
the Motown Museum -- he
began singing Motown songs

and dancing Motown dances,
turning the tour into a full out
performance that became one
of the many things that draw
people from around the world
to the West Grand Boulevard
location.
"I really love working there.
I love Motown," Dandridge
said. "To see people come out
and some cry, some laugh, some
thank you for taking them down
memory lane. All of the mem-
bers that work there, all of the
staff, all have a passion for
Motown and really have a pas-
sion for the music. That's what
makes it really enjoyable to
work there. We dance, and we
sing, and we have a lot of fun."
A world map in the front
hall of the museum boasts
an immense number of pins,
placed by visitors from all over
- France, England, Egypt, and
more. Tens of thousands of peo-
ple flock to the museum each
year, and in the summer months
the line wraps around the block
with people waiting to see the
home of The Motown sound.
West Grand
Blvd. museum
keeps Hitsville,
USA alive.
Though Dandridge is moving
on from Detroit, he isn't leaving
Motown behind; he'll be per-
forming in a Motown show on
Carnival Cruise ships touring
around the Caribbean islands.
Motown has been the catalyst
that has directed his life, and
the impact is reciprocal - the
Museum has been impacted by
his presence and the time he
has given back to it can be seen
through the songs sung by tour
guides into the echo chamber
upstairs or when people dance
to The Temptations in Studio
A.
"It's a part of American Cul-
ture. It's a part of the songs
of Motown; it's the soundtrack
of the '60s, '70s, '80s, and even
now. It really shaped people.
Music is a universal language,
and that's what Motown really
gave. A lot of people go back to
Motown music because it makes
them laugh. It makes them cry.
It had a lot of emotion. People
should come to learn about it."

'Americans' grows in season two

ByALEXINTNER
DailyArts Writer
For great TV dramas, the sec-
ond season ideally takes the ideas
the show planted in season one
and builds upon
them. Season
two increases
the depth of the The
show's world
and characters Amercans
while maintain- Season 2
ing its ongoing Premiere
story. If season
one is the estab- Wednesday
lishment of the at 10 p.m.
story, season FX
two is where
shit gets real.
The second season of "The Ameri-
cans" does just this, taking the
story from season one and increas-
ing the potential consequences of
the characters' actions, as well as
deepening the audience's under-
standing of them.
"The Americans" follows Eliza-
beth (Keri Russell, "Felicity") and
Peter Jennings (Matthew Rhys,
"Brothers & Sisters"), a team of
spies who work for the KGB during
the 1980s, posing as husband and
wife outside of Washington DC. It
portrays the balance of their mis-
sions and their family. There is also
Stan Beemen (Noah Emmerich,
"The Walking Dead"), the Jen-
nings' neighbor and an FBI Agent
who is working to take down the
KGB's operations in America.
The increasing depth of the
content plays out most in Peter
and Elizabeth's storyline. As they
invest more and more in their
operations, including the involve-
ment of their children (without the

kids knowledge), their missions
get more interesting. This is the
best material for the actors to work
with, as they are forced to show
a deep mix of emotions - worry,
fear - while never losing a straight
face.
The second season expands
the presence of the Jenning's two
children, and this is a good thing
for the show. Over the last several
years, television has had a prob-
lem with teenage characters being
whiny and annoying. Paige Jen-
nings (newcomer Holly Taylor)
verges on becoming the stereo-
typical "annoying teenage charac-
ter" as she starts to investigate her
parents. She never crosses the line,
but the writers might if they're not
careful.
"The Americans" succeeds
by increasing the involvement of
Agent Beeman and his mistress/
source in the KGB Nina (Annet
Mahendru, "Escape from Tomor-
row"). Season one ended with Nina
being forced to turn on Beeman
and report on his actions to the
KGB. What results is an intriguing
double cross, with Beeman falling
deeper in love with Nina and Nina
losing feelings for him. Mahendru

is successful at being more than a
pretty face, and watching her play
Nina's deception is what makes
this arc interesting.
The show's biggest problem
is also one of its strengths. "The
Americans" takes itself seri-
ously, almost to a fault. Some
of the scenes in the first half of
each episode are very dry. While
they're usually captivating, filled
with great dialogue and character
moments, when the dialogue isn't
there, the episode quickly becomes
boring.
Much of the "The Americans"
's success depends on the strength
of its cast. Russell, Rhys and Emm-
erich exhibit an extremely high
level of acting difficulty, as each
of their characters has many com-
plex layers (certain aspects of their
characters are visible at different
times).
As the show's writers contin-
ue to increase the stakes for the
characters, andas the actors add
more layers to their performances,
things look to keep on getting bet-
ter. Despite a few dry scenes in its
season premiere, "The Americans"
remains one of the most fascinat-
ing dramas on television.

ANDREW LUBIMOV/AP
New mayor of the city of Sevastopol Alexey Chaly, center, speaks to a crowd during a rally in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on
Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2014.
Ethnic Russians consider
secession from Ukraine

Crimea is home to
Russia's Black
Sea fleet
SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP)
- Dozens of pro-Russian pro-
testers rallied Tuesday in the
Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea
against "the bandits" in Kiev
who are trying to form a new
government - with some even
speakingofsecession. Alawmak-
er from Russia stoked their pas-
sions further by promising them
that Russia will protect them.
As a Russian flag flew Tuesday
in front of the city council build-
ing in Sevastopol - a key Crime-
an port where Russia's Black Sea
Fleet is based - an armored Rus-
sian personnel carrier and two
trucks full of troops made a rare
appearance on the streets of the
city.
The Crimean Peninsula - a
pro-Russian region about the
size of Massachusetts or Belgium
- is a tinder pot in the making.
Protesters had torn down the
Ukrainian flag a day ago, plead-
ing with Moscow to protect
them fromthe new authorities in
Ukraine who have forced Presi-
dent Viktor Yanukovych to flee
Kiev, the capital, and go into hid-
ing.
"Bandits have come to power,"
said Vyacheslav Tokarev, a
39-year-old construction worker
in Sevastopol. "I'm ready to take
arms to fight the fascists who

have seized power in Kiev."
Yanukovych's whereabouts
are unknown but he was last
reportedly seen in the Crimea.
Law enforcement agencies have
issued an arrest warrant for
Yanukovych over the killing of
82 people, mainly protesters, last
week in the bloodiest violence in
Ukraine's post-Soviet history.
Chanting "Russia, save us!"
the protesters gathered for a
third day before administrative
buildings in Sevastopol and in
other Crimean cities. The pro-
tests Sunday numbered in the
thousands.
"We won't allow them to
wipe their feet on us," protester
Anatoly Mareta said in Sevas-
topol, wearing the colors of the
Russian flag on his arm. "Only
Russia will be able to protect
the Crimea."
"I hope for the Ossetian
way," he said, referring to the
brief but fierce 2008 Russian-
Georgian war in which Russian
tanks and troops helped the
separatist provinces of South
Ossetia and Abkhazia to break
free of Georgian control. Russia
has recognized both as inde-
pendence states, but -few other
nations have.
Russia, which has thousands
of Black Sea Fleet seamen at
its base in Sevastopol, so far
has refrained from any sharp
moves in Ukraine's political
turmoil but could be drawn into
the fray if there are confronta-
tions between Crimean popula-

tion and supporters of the new
authorities.
The open movement of Rus-
sian military vehicles - nor-
mally avoided in Sevastopol per
Ukrainian request - was seen
as a reflection of the tensions
gripping the city.
A senior Russian lawmaker,
meanwhile, promised protest-
ers that Russia will protect its
Russian-speaking compatriots
in Ukraine.
"If lives and health of our
compatriots are in danger,
we won't stay aside," Leonid
Slutsky told activists in Sim-
feropol, the regional capital of
Crimea.
Slutsky, who heads a parlia-
mentary committee in charge
of relations with other ex-Sovi-
et republics, also promised that
the Russian parliament is con-
sidering a bill to offer Crimea
residents and others in Ukraine
a quick way of getting Russian
citizenship.
He also declared that Yanu-
kovych remains the only legiti-
mate leader of Ukraine, adding
there is a "big question mark"
over the legitimacy of the deci-
sions made by the Ukrainian
parliament since he left the seat
of power.
Ukraine's new authorities
are clearly concerned about the
tensions in Crimea. The coun-
try's interim leader, Oleksandr
Turchinov, met with top secu-
rity officials Tuesday to discuss
the situation there.

TECH
From Page lA
in the region during the next five
years.
The $148 million high-tech
hub is part of a larger $1 billion
government project to create a
national network for manufactur-
ing innovation to revitalize and
specialize domestic manufactur-
ing in the face of rising global
competition.
"In the 2000s alone, we lost
about one third of all Ameri-
can manufacturing jobs - and
the middle class suffered for it,"
Obama said. "Now the good news
today is that our manufacturers
have added more than 620,000
new manufacturing jobs over the
last four years. That's the first
sustained manufacturing growth
in over 20 years."
University President Mary Sue
Coleman and Jack Hu, interim
vice president for research, both
served on a working group that
recommended the creation of the
National Network of Manufactur-
ing Innovation in 20.
"Through this initiative, our
region will build on its core
strengths to become the nation's
technology hub for lightweight
materials and manufacturing,"
Coleman said in a statement.
"Companies from around the
country will come here not only
because of our technological
capabilities, but also because we
have the workforce they need
in their efforts to revitalize and
transform domestic manufactur-
ing."
The ALMMII will focus on
innovations in lightweight metals
- a key component in increasing
fuel efficiency by reducing weight
- by facilitating the process
between new innovations and
adoption for use in cars, trucks,
airplanes and ships.

"That journey was every bit

Engineering Prof Alan Taub,
who will serve as ALMMII's chief
technology officer, said the hub
will take theoretical technologies
and turn them into manufactured
realities at an affordable cost.
"Today, when a companywants
to lighten the structural part -
whether it's of a navy ship, a com-
mercial aircraft, or a light vehicle
- it costs more moneyto do it, and
our goal is to produce manufac-
turing technologiesnthatcan make
those changes more affordable,"
Taub said.
Taub added that the city of
Detroit would benefit from the
newhub.
"It's jobs," Taub said. "It's
where we're going to train the
workforce, everything from engi-
neers to plant line operators, and
it would be natural then beyond
the traditional companies for
additional companies to locate
here in order to use this newtech-
nology."
The projection of 10,000 jobs
created will largely be generated
through metal stamping, metal-
working, machining and casting
industries that will benefit from
the new technologies piloted at
the ALMMIL.
While the University's role at
the ALMMII will shrink after the
first five years, Hu said the con-
nection would remain.
"(ALMMII) is an independent
entity even though the University
is a co-founder," Hu said. "But I
think in order for the technol-
ogy to be used by industry, you
need that intermediate organiza-
tion to help with the translation
because research at a university is
very basic and cannot be directly
applied by industry. So by having
institutes like this, you make the
technologies more mature and
ready for industrial use. We may
not be as closely involved after
the first five years, but still our
ties with the institute and other

"She leads her classes to ask just

als can teach us about particular
social and historical realities," he
wrote in an e-mail interview. "She
is a deeply thoughtful teacher who
listens to her students, and allows
them to develop their own voices
and positions."
Sweeney said the process of
helping students like Pickus in
long-term projects was fulfilling.
She discussed the importance of
"findingyourselfin scholarship."
"That gets back to the idea for
students to figure it out what they
want and why it matters," Sweeney
said. "It's notnjusteto get a grade, but
to try to understand why do I care
about these subjects, why does this
matter to me, what do I want read-

On Tuesday afternoon, a
writer for the University News
Service tweeted a picture of Sen.
Carl Levin (D-Mich.) joined by
Taub and Hu at the White House
announcement.
Levin lauded Obama's
announcement in a statement
released Tuesday.
"The investment announced
today will mean the University
of Michigan, Michigan State
University, Michigan Tech and
Wayne State University will
team with other great academic
institutions, as well as nonprofit
groups such as Focus:HOPE and
a wide array of industry partners,
to advance new technologies that
will bring important capabilities
to our military and new economic
opportunities for our people,"
Levin wrote.
Two hubs like ALMMII have
already been built - one in
Youngstown, Ohio specializing
in 3-D printing and a second in
Raleigh, North Carolina special-
izing in energy-efficient electron-
ics - and Obama plans to launch
four more this year.
Despite the positive outlook,
other developed industrial pow-
ers are racing to create innovation
centers of their own - providing
competition for the American
initiative. Germany already has
a vast network of 60 high-tech
hubs, and Obama called on Con-
gress to notbecome complacent.
"I don't want the next big job
creating discovery to come from
Germany or China or Japan, I
want it to be made here in Ameri-
ca," Obama said. "So we've got to

Israeli PM refuses to
elaborate on air strike

Netanyahu yet to
confirm missile
strikes on Syria-
Lebanon border
JERUSALEM (AP) - Isra-
el's prime minister on Tuesday
refused to confirm whether his
country carried out an airstrike
along the Syrian-Lebanon border,
but said he would do everything
possible to protect the security of
Israeli citizens.
Benjamin Netanyahu delivered
his vague answer hours after Leb-
anon's state news agency reported
that Israeli aircraft carried out
two airstrikes late Monday. While
Israel's military refused to com-
ment, Israel has carried outsimilar
airstrikes in the past on suspected
weapons shipments believed to be
bound from Syria to Hezbollah
guerrillas in Lebanon.
At a news conference with the
visiting German chancellor, Ange-
la Merkel, he said Israel's policy is
not to discuss what others claim it
did.
"We do all that is needed to
protect the security of Israeli citi-
zens," he said.
Israel and Hezbollah fought a
monthlong war in 2006 that ended
in a stalemate. Israeli officials
believe Hezbollah has restocked
its arsenal with tens of thousands
of rockets and missiles, some of
which are capable of striking vir-
tually anywhere in the Jewish

state.
Although Israel has refrained
from taking sides in the Syrian
civil war, Netanyahu has repeated-
ly vowed to take action to prevent
Hezbollah from obtaining "game
changing" weapons from its ally
Syria. Past Israeli airstrikes are
believed to have targeted Russian-
made anti-aircraft missiles and
guided missiles from Iran. Israel
has never confirmed the airstrikes.
Lebanon's National News Agen-
cy said the air raids took place
near Nabi Sheet, a remote village
in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley.
The agency did not say what was
targeted in the attack. The porous
border is frequently used by fight-
ers and smugglers to move people
and weapons between Lebanon
and Syria. Hezbollahb has a strong
presence in the area. Arab media
reports said Hezbollah had suf-
fered casualties, though neither
the group nor the Lebanese mili-
tary confirmed an airstrike had
actually taken place.
Earlier this week, Israel's mili-
tary chief, Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz,
accused Iran, a key backer of Syria
and Hezbollah, of "handing out
torches to the pyromaniacs." He
spoke during a tour of the Golan
Heights, a strategic area near Syria
and Lebanon.
"Right now we're in the Golan
Heights and it seems quiet and
peaceful. I suggest that everyone
keeps in mind that underneath this
quiet, a storm is brewing - day,
night and in every setting," Gantz
said.

A rivalry, even on the ice

Smith finding an
offensive rhythm

ByJEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
It's 'Ohio' week in February.
The hype of a Saturday in
late November might not be
swirling around Ann Arbor and
Columbus, but the Michigan-
Ohio State rivalry is still held to a
high standard on the ice.
The Wolverines have finished
ahead of the Buckeyes in the
conference standings for each
of the past 10 seasons and hold a
72-33-11 edge since the first game
was played between the two
schools on Feb. 8, 1964. Records
and a lopsided difference in
program prestige might not point
to a heated rivalry, but everything
else does.
"It's a big game between
two rival schools, and you feel
that out on the ice," said senior
defenseman Mac Bennett.
"People are making that extra
effort or fighting a little bit more
to get that puck, and they're
exciting games to play in."
Take the 2004 CCHA
championship, for example.
Michigan and Ohio State came
into the conference tournament
sitting in first and fourth,
respectively. The Wolverines
came out flat, and after conceding
three second-period goals,
stumbled toward a front-row
seat to Ohio State's first CCHA
championship since 1972.
The next season, in 2004-
05, Michigan finished atop the
conference with the Buckeyes
close behind. No matchups
could particularly be classified
as an upset, but those contests
provoked a sincere hostility
between the two sides due to
their competitiveness.
Michigan coach Red
Berenson said the construction
of Value City Arena - the
current home of Ohio State
basketball and men's hockey
programs - in 2000 ignited the

hockey program's relevance on a
more national scale. Previously,
the Buckeyes played in a rink
that held 1,700 people and
hardly resembled a place that
supported Division I athletics.
"It was too bad, but it was a
disgrace to Ohio for them to have
to play Division I hockey in that
rink," Berenson said.
Since the opening of Value
City Arena, it'd be fair to say
Ohio State's increased relevance
has created its benefits for the
Wolverines, too.
Senior forward Derek DeBlois
remembers struggling through a
seven-game losing streak during
his sophomore season. With
a weekend series with Ohio
State looming, the Wolverines
desperately needed a way out of
a massive sinkhole. That time,

the Buckeyes were ranked No.
2 in the nation, but DeBlois and
company outscored their rivals
8-1 over the weekend.
"I think it was the most packed
it's been since we've played
there,"DeBloissaid. "Thatkindof
turned around our whole season,
so it was an exciting time."
Berenson creditsthe increased
television exposure from the
Big Ten Network and the
conference schedule as keys to
igniting the rivalry even more.
With teams vying for the same
recruits, bragging rights and
championships, rivalries become
inevitable.
"You saw the outpouring
support when they played here
the first time we played them,"
Bennett said. "That place was
nuts."

It was quite the spectacle. Big
Ten Commissioner Jim Delaney
was in attendance alongside
5,800 fans who were well aware
of what a matchup between
Michigan and Ohio State should
entail. Most left satisfied,
too, after sophomore forward
Andrew Copp's winning goal
in overtime. The following
Monday in Columbus, Bennett
proved to be the hero when he
netted a game-winner in the
final minutes.
"The losing team always
feels it's a bigger rivalry than
the winning team," said senior
forward Luke Moffatt. "Just
because it hurts so much more to
lose than it feels good to win."
When these teams meet this
weekend, there's no reason to
expect any different sentiment.

Guard tallies 38
points in two games
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Though the final score
said otherwise, the Michigan
women's basketball team didn't
feel like it
walked away NOTEBOOK
with a loss
Saturday to Iowa.
In its last home game of the
season, the Wolverines (8-7
Big Ten, 17-11 overall) played
strong in both halves and shot
50.8 percent, matching its
best shooting performance in
conference play.
"We knew it was going to be a
tough matchup for us, but it went
back and forth," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "We
came out ready to play."
And for the second time in
as many games, junior guard
Shannon Smith led the way.
Smith started the season as
the team's only viable offensive
option, but the growth and
emergence of junior forward
Cyesha Goree and freshman
guard Siera Thompson has often
put Smith in the backseat of the
scoring action.
In Michigan's last two games,
though, Smith has put up 38
total points. But in the game
before that, though, she was held
to just five.
"That's what we've talked to
Shannon about, you have to be
more consistent," Barnes Arico
said.
Smith's inconsistency is
attributed to the fact that the
opposing team's best defender
hovers between her and
Thompson. When one isn't in

an offensive rhythm, the other
faces the best defenders.
"When -you put numbers
up like that, you're facing the
opponents' best defender night
in and night out," Barnes Arico
said. "They're trying to be
physical with you and they're
trying to bang you around.
Shannon's really thin and tiny,
and she had to get accustomed
to that, and she had to learn to
adjust to that.
"And against Indiana and
Iowa she did."
DOMINATING THE
MIDDLE: Senior center Val
Driscoll has been an unexpected
force in the middle this season.
Last year, Driscoll sat out the
entire campaign with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament. But
after months of recovery, she has
stormed back to make the most
of her last season as a Wolverine.
With Michigan in need of
height in its starting lineup,
Driscoll's 6-foot-4 frame was
a welcomed option. Now a
consistent starter, Driscoll
averages six rebounds and just
over two blocks per game. The
center is tied for seventh in
program history on the single-
season block list.
Driscoll has been a big reason
why the Wolverines have
outrebounded their opponents
in 24 of 28 games. Against the
Hawkeyes, Driscoll posted a
career-high 18 points.
"Our kids did a great job
of really looking inside, of
attacking the high-low, of
getting Val or Cyesha touches,"
Barnes Arico said. "It's so great
for a coach to see a young lady
develop like she has, and see
her have such a special night
in front of her parents and her
family and her team."

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Senior forward Derek DeBlois has fond memories of playing Ohio State, a rivalry the Wolverines have dominated lately.

year, the target is on Michigan's

the beginning of its dominant

the Wolverines to their 38th Big

"This one's special," Bottom
said. "It's the first time we're at

excited.
"This is the best, fastest

No one's going to deny that, and
we want this one bad."

Sophomore forward Nik Stauskas will look to continue his hot hand at Purdue.
Keys to the gam---e:
'M' visits Purdue-

basketball team had one week
to prepare for its game against
archrival Michigan State, and it
showed. Despite a slow start, the

Now
holding sole
possession of first place in the
Big Ten with just four games to
play, it must avoid a letdown if
it hopes to win its first outright
conference title in almost 30
years. The final stretch of the
season starts Wednesday, when
the Wolverines head to West
Lafayette to take on a middling
Purdue (5-9, 15-12) that has lost
seven of its last nine games.
Michigan won the previous
meeting, 75-66, on Jan. 30 in
Ann Arbor. The Daily breaks
down the three keys for another
victory:
Continue the Nik and
Caris show: it's clear that the
Wolverines are at their best
when sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas is at his. Early in Big
Ten play, Stauskas emerged
as one of the country's most
dangerous scorers, and as
Michigan rode a 10-game win
streak through East Lansing
and Madison, the talk shifted
to Stauskas' professional
aspirations. But when Stauskas'
play dropped off,the Wolverines
lost three of five games despite
a scoring surge from sophomore
guard Caris LeVert.
But when both are on, like
they were against the Spartans
- the guards combined to
score 48 points - the Michigan
backcourt is lethal enough to
beat anyone in the nation.
Control the ball: In the

teams' previous meeting, the
Wolverines shot a whopping
60.4 percent from the field,
yet only beat the struggling
Boilermakers by nine. How was
the game so close?
Michigan's starting backcourt
- Stauskas, LeVert and freshman,
point guard Derrick Walton Jr.-
combined to turn the ball over 10
times, and the team had 16 total
turnovers. That figure, more than
six above the team's average, kept
Purdue in the game - it led to 12
Boilermaker points.
If the Wolverines can
replicate their three-turnover
performance from Sunday's
win, they should have no
troubles with the Boilermakers.
Play your game: At the end
of the day, stats can be thrown
out in a game likethis. Michigan
is the vastly superior team, with
more talent, experience and
all the momentum on its side.
Purdue, on the other hand, is
sputtering to the finish line,
and a win over the 16th-ranked
Wolverines would be a nice way
to go out.
Don't expect the Boilermakers
to simply roll over, meaning the
onus is on Michigan to come out
looking focused.
"They're just as tough a game
to us as if we went to Ohio State,
went to Michigan State. They
may not be to the media, they
may not be in reality, but they
are to me," said Michigan coach
John Beilein.
That sounds nice, though it's
easier said than done, especially
coming from a coach and not a
group of college kids riding
high from the win of their
season. Still, Beilein insists that
he'll have his team ready.
"That's our whole job as a
coach, to be able to make sure
that they understand that at
this level of basketball, every
game is going to be a battle,"
Beilein said.
If he succeeds, his team
should, and relatively easily.

Michigan 81, Purdue 63

all - ina category that is
judged on such unquantifiable
and subjective factors -
unmistakably incorrect. But
since someone in Michigan's
vastly expanding marketing
department opened the
discussion, I'll play along. The
Maize Rage, the Michigan men's
basketball student section, is
at best No. 7 in the conference;
Minnesota in a good year can
arguably push it down to No.8.
But while the Athletic
Department likes to deflect
blame, this one can't be pinned
nn fh-+ti-+ntP

"If you put the students by the
court and you care about them,
you care about the experience,
you'll have a great environment,"
Rosenbaum said. "If you don't,
you'll have Crisler Center."
Officially, students are
allotted 3,000 of Crisler's 12,707
seats, though an additional 300
were saved for Sunday's game in
anticipation of increased student
demand. However, just 653 of
those seats are in the lower
bowl, and fewer than 400, a
meager 12 percent of the student
allocation, are the courtside
bleacher seats that encompass
the heart of the Maize Rage.
Compared with the Spartans'
Izzone, which wraps around
three-fourths of the arena,
pitting thousands of screaming
students right on top of opposing
players, Crisler is practically a
friendly confine.
And at least a friendly confine
awards some character to the
environment, which it had little
of in the buildup to Sunday's
game - the biggest home game
of the season against the school's
biggest rival.
Less than an hour before
game time, the building was
dead - save for a slew of
corporate and University ads
and the occasional chorus of
boos or cheers when the teams
entered or exited the floor.
Though nearly every student
seat was filled 50 minutes before
game time, the lack of buzz was
palpable with two-thirds of the
students a great distance from
the floor and only a handful
of non-students already in the
building. It was a stark contrast
from the game in East Lansing
a month earlier, when the
Breslin Center atmosphere was
fully charged well over an hour
before tip-off.
"It was dead in there -
it's embarrassing," Sallen
remembers of the two hours
spent before the game sitting
in the upper bowl of Crisler.
"You're sitting there waiting for
+hp Anrk t" nin ci-" nd tt-

game to start because that's all
there is to really think about.
You're not in the environment
of getting all crazy and rowdy.
You're just another spectator
that happens to have a general
admission ticket."
Added Rosenbaum: "It's
definitely deflating. The
whole thing is just a corporate
environment, which is fine for the
Super Bowl, but it shouldn't be
that way for Michiganbasketball.
If youlook atthe great programs,
the really crazy places to play
collegebasketball,that's not what
they're like. They're not run like
it's Domino's."
LSA sophomore Yale
Williams arrived at Crisler
at 6:45 a.m., early enough to
score seats in the bleachers
because his three experiences
sitting in the upper bowl were
"almost like watching iton TV,"
with those around him sitting
through the game's entirety,
texting or talking to friends. The
high levels of disengagement
in the upperbowl contrasts
greatly to the students in lower-
bowl seating, especially in the
bleachers, where students stand
for the duration of games.
Business senior Alex
Loewenstein echoed those
comments as the reason why,
after sitting mostly in the upper
bowllastyear, he opted to watch
the games fromhome this season.
"I can't justify to myself
spending two hours in line or
paying that much money when
I know I'm goingto sit in the
upper bowl," he said.
Central Student Government
President Michael Proppe, a
Business senior and season-
ticket holder himself, has made
the student experience at
sporting events a pivotal part of
his agenda. Though the general
admission policy for football
games has loomed larger on
campus, amatter reflected in
Proppe's conversations with
the Athletic Department and
in CSG meetings, the Crisler
r^"n"ndrm as r"r""A rmih+

his attention.
He and CSG Vice President
Bobby Dishell, a Public Policy
junior, have been gathering
data, not only on Maize Rage
attendance, which he said has
been "very high," but on where
Crisler's student section stacks
up against Big Ten competitors.
"It seems like right now we
are one of the smaller courtside
student sections in the Big Ten,"
Proppe said. "Given where our
program is at and the level of
student interest, I think the
evidence is pretty compelling
... that in the nextcyear or so,
expanding the lower-bowl
student section should be given
pretty serious consideration."
Still, though, Proppe
expressed caution that any
major change will be made in
the immediate future. While
smaller adjustments, such as
moving up the claim period
closer to the game dates, could
happen for next season, he
believes that it'll take at least
a couple more years of high
attendance figures "before they
start to re-seat the entire arena."
So while an expanded
bleacher section wrapping
around the arena is certainly
unrealistic in the next season
or two on the heels of the 2011
interior renovations to Crisler,
the Athletic Department can
choose to make short-term
adjustments, such as converting
current non-student sections
in the lower bowl to student
seating, much like the 250-seat
section 130.
"It's something that's ontheir
mind, but it's not being given a
super-serious look," Proppe said.
Following the win in East
Lansing, Brandon turned to a
Michigan State athletic official
and said, "I'm jealous" of the
"incredible" atmosphere he
witnessed - even in spite
of a Spartan loss. It was an
atmosphere Brandon would
certainly love to bring to
Ann Arbor, but is it enough
of a desire to come at the cost
of losing the Personal Seat
Donations - hefty charges in
addition to the per-game cost -
from non-student season ticket
holders in the lower bowl?
Only time will tell, but
Brandon's track record suggests
the answer is no. So while
the pockets of one of the
richest athletic departments
will continue to grow, so too
will student unrest with the
department.
"I don't think there are too
many administrations out there
that care less about the student
experience," Rosenbaum said.
The message Brandon is
sending to the students - the
ones expected to be future
donors and season-ticket holders
- is clear, and it's not one
that can be soothed over with
preposterous attempts to flatter.
Because if the Athletic
Department wants to flaunt
the Maize wRage as the best
anything, it's high time it starts
treating its students like it.

The Maize Rage is hindered by the seating arrangements, diminishing the Crisler Center atmosphere, writes Wasserman.

THE THINGS WE CARRY

I bear into this room a package full of the
love my mother felt toward my father. The
mug of coffee on the counter each day, the
proper professor food, she told her friends
about his Ph.D. And he studied galaxies,
planets circling in orbit, the inevitable
collision of decomposition. This space dust
would fall from his mouth at dinnertime,
senseless matter that would coat the kitchen
plates and seats and walls. He was used to
speaking, while she would touch his elbow,
brush his back lightly, each point of contact a
pull of gravity. My father built constellation
palaces around himself. My mother passed
him lemon bars to keep cool in his study
during summertime. She-
filled the gaps of air around him. She-
smiled daily, licked at rose lipstick, trying
to compete with stars.

A DAY AT THE FAIR AMY HENSON

Dear readers,
For writers, it's a hard-knock life. Seriously. The world is funky,
and the world is also filled with rainwater, chocolates, glue

sticks and star fruit. Which is to say, the world is filled with the 5 T I R !
visual, the brave. We write so we can remember. We write so
we can press the eye's detail to the page; so we can make and ER I K A
shift and save and carve. It's not magic, but it's something that N E STO R

levitates, touches gravity and enfolds both brain and heart in
a delicious way. It's a difficult duty to do justice to the planet's
wondrous weight and gold. Yet, writers somehow manage to
cause sparks with the alphabet.
This year, The Statement's Literary Issue attempts to introduce
you to writing that uproots and imagines. We hope these pieces
cause readers to rethink the familiar into the strange. We hope
they turn the common into the fresh. Here at The Statement,
we are incredibly in awe and proud to feature the creative work
of such talented student writers. We hope the readers will find
that the poems and prose in this issue cradle, flit, unsettle the
dirt and do work in the world.
Sincerely,

After the fever
I only remember waking up to find everything
revealed,
my pale n ightmare
of the sun in a rainstorm
and my mother moving in and out of sight
stumbling and laughing,
the messy relief of night-watch survived:
my baby chanted,
whispered, a thousand times. The bundle
of my body under three blankets, rolling over
and over again. Hot dry tongue, purple sky
becoming pink & how the room
grew larger as it spun.
My father sat sitting by the door,
his fingers curled around a cup of coffee.
Close enough to touch, the lines of his mouth
pulled down, my sister's grayjumper drip
dripping on stained wood. The floor shook
when he stood up, and touched a single finger
to my glassy skin. Behind me the rocking chair
was creaking, someone's dog
somewhere barking.
Beyond the great green incline
of the couch I saw my mother's fingers
twitchingover buttered toast, smelled
her sharp familiar perfume like the aftermath
of fear, In my dream, my mother turned
pursuer, and I woke up with a stitch in my side.
And yet: I sawher only
in profile, as I dreamed-
it migh t have been

OP Ar 00 0

'm an imposter in my blazer from eighth grade.
Waiting in line at (Fortune 500 Company X), I'm
mentally prepping for the eight-or-so minutes Iwill
have to make an impression, and my brain just won't turn
off. Be natural. Be exceptional. Be funny. Be relatable. Be
cool. Be smart. Be interested. Be interesting. Just be your-
self.
I wipe a sweaty palm across the back of the leather
resume holder I felt compelled to buy junior year. It leaves a
smear, and I debate blowing it dry with my mouth. instead
I open the thing up, looking at my resume for the millionth
time.
My resume. The story of me in a neutral serif font, size
10. Complete with a professional summary, list of experi-
ences and strong action verbs for each bullet point (not
forgetting to show the results of my responsibilities with
numbers!).
. Spearheaded
. Implemented
" Managed
The result of hours of frustration with unaligned indents
and bullets and headlines, this 8.5" by 11" sheet of paper has
become my "foot in the door." Kind of.
"I look at resumes for new hires at Puma, and we real-
ly just go through the database and search certain buzz-
words." My cousin, the Global Product Group Manager at
Puma, helped me with my resume last year. "Not higher
than a 3.5 GPA? Gone. No retail experience? Gone. No lead-
ership experience? Gone."
"How many people get hired based on their resumes?"
I ask.
"Barely any. It's all about networking."
So, I learn the art of the palm-to-palm handshake
(Remember: only two shakes! Any more than that and
you're stuck in a handshake-death-spiral with a recruiter
who will probably dismiss you as unemployable while you
incessantly shake and smile and shake and smile). I learn
about selling myself, about dealing with recruiters, about
"networking." I learn because I have to, because those
around me are also learning, because this is what it takes to
become a successful adult, right?
I imagine the career fair from above looks like a hellish,
business-casual picnic. The 48 company recruiting tables
are draped in brightly colored tablecloths, swarmed by
eager-for-employment University of Michigan students -
ants in formal attire. We crawl, we schmooze, we shake
hands. Employ us, we beg. We take our promotional pens
and sunglasses and water bottles and move on. Except in
this ant colony, we don't work together. In this, it's every'
ant for himself.
As a senior at a competitive university like Michigan, the
job hunt is both exhilarating and exhausting; we hate it, but
we love it. All of us aren't sure what we will really be
doing at these companies. but we go for the big jobs
anyway. We want the great salaries. We want to hK
successful and we want to be happy. But at what point do
perfected elevator pitches, strong handshakes and font-
size-10 resumes make us stand out"
Finally, the recruiter smiles in my direction, indl-
eating that my turn has arrived. She is no older than
24. fresh-faced and happy to have her day away Fron
the office. I go in for a firm, doubie-pump palm-to-pain
handshake, and the dance negins.
"Hi! I'm Katherine. Great to meet vou..'"
"...Amy. Hi! Great to meet you, Katherine. (insert
small talk here. i.e. 'It' sto hot in here, how are you
holding up?')"

"(Insert response small talk. i.e. 'I know right? So hot.
But hangin' in there!'). So tell me a little about yourself,
Amy."
Tell her about myself. Tell her that I am always, always,
always on time. That Iam naturally curious, and love work-
ing with smart, creative people. That I am a writer. That
I love making people smile. That I am an English major
who isn't planning on teaching or going to graduate school,
actually. That my favorite sections of the New York Times
are Technology, Opinion and Books. That I would give 100
percent to this company because I've given 100 percent to
all of my activities since I started dance class at four years
old. That I really want to find a job that I love, but fear I
never will. That I hate recruiting, hate this blazer, hate that
my palms are sweaty, hate that I'm second-guessing my lib-
eral arts degree. That no job offer will be better than these
past years as a student and that I never want to leave this
place for the real world.
Myself is me, sitting in my Michigan sweats talking with
friends about our obscene Oreo intake, laughing at Drake
on Saturday Night Live. I am an empathetic listener with a
dry sense of humor and naturally decisive tendencies - but
somehow couldn't get all that onto my resume.
Just be yourself but I don't see how I can.
Especially when I'm wearing this outfit. Why this is
called business casual, I'll never understand. Casual is
jeans and a tee shirt. Casual is sneakers. Casual is com-,
fortable, and I feel anything but. I notice with envy that
Recruiter Katherine and all of her recruiter buddies from
(Fortune 500 Company X) are wearing jeans and company-
logo T-shirts. "We don't dress up for work. Really, we would
never wear something like you're wearing." This comment
makes me feel weird, but okay. Conversation continues.
Eventually, we end up discussing the job posting I found
online for a writing-based position. I'm feeling pretty excit-
ed about it, and ask about the recruiting process for full-
time hires.
"Oh, I don't really
handle that
kind of work.
I recruit for
Sales. But
you can go
talk to Jessica!
She knows more
about those
kinds of posi-
tions than

What.

move over to Jessica, a girl I swear I have seen walking
through the Diag over the years. She is wearing her blue
jeans, standard-issue logo T-shirt and a pair of Converse
sneakers, and looks more like the college student in this
exchange than I do. I go through the hand-shake-small-
talk-tell-me-about-yourself routine, and then ask about
that same writing position.
"Oh, interesting redirect by Katherine. I actually just
started three weeks ago, so I don't really know much about
anything other than Sales. You should go to www.(fortune-
500companyx).com/careers and check it out though!"
Yes, I have checked that out, actually.
"Great, thank you for your help."
"Would you like a stress ball?"
Yes, I would like a stress ball.
"Sure."
I don't give her my resume, and my foot remains firm-
ly outside the door to (Fortune 500 Company X). I crawl
onward, shoving my new stress ball into my purse.
I wait in another excruciatingly long line for a different
company, and start to chat with the guy waiting in front
of me. His blazer hangs folded over his right arm, and the
rings of sweat pooling around his armpits make my thank-
ful that my nervous sweating problem is in my palms.
"Yeah, I'm a sophomore. I'm here for internships."
A sophomore?
"Cool! What's your major?"
"Computer Science. I just built my own server this sum-
mer. I can access it from anywhere in the world. It's dope.
What's your major?"
Holy shit - what am I doing next to this kid?
"I'm studying English and New Media," I tell baby-
genius.
"Like blogs? Wow, they have classes for that? I thought
anyone could blog."
I decide to disengage, reaching for my iPhone to shut
this kid up. He puts his blazer back on and taps his foot
impatiently, waiting for his turn. Later on, I can hear
baby-genius talking with a recruiter from a huge
technology company. His voice sounds different;
his hands are working it; he's doing the dance. I
close my eyes. He's a sophomore.
"NEXT!" My turn.

Wednesday, February 26, 201411 The Statement E3 'I

he glare of the incandescent lights
seemed brighter than ever, and
the room seemed to have tripled
in size in the few minutes I had been in
it. Inhale, exhale, inhale, repeat. I took a
few deep breaths, cleared my throat, and
searched for a familiar face in the crowd.
Focusing on one person always helps me get
through challenges, as if the silent support of
a pair of eyes could infuse me with a steady
strength. The eyes seemed to blend together
in an expansive sea of faces, and I could feel
my heartbeat gradually quickening. I won-
dered if the audience could sense my anxiety.
"Just feel the power of the words," my aunt's
voice echoed in my mind, "and you'll be fine."
I lowered my glance, and my eyes landed
on a maroon-colored rectangular carpet,
splashed with images of fuchsia roses and
powdered lilies, the picture the song lyrics
conjured up. I mustered the courage to pro-
duce a single note, but after a few seconds,
the tone shook, and I couldn't sustain it any
4 longer. I couldn't continue with the perfor-
mance, I had disappointed everyone. It was
over.
It's been six years since this scene. I was
in India, around the time of my cousin's wed-
ding. I haven't had the courage or desire to
sing since that failure. The magic in sing-
ing seemed less clear to me after such an
embarrassing experience. It was as if fear
had quelled the passion that had originally
driven me to perform for others, blurring
my understanding of why music still needed
to remain a part of my life. Despite this, I've
grown up in a musical household. Singing
and dancing were always part of my life,
expected in a sort of way. Music has histori-
cally been a part of Indian culture. A number
of dance and musical styles have originated
in the country, and the sheer melodic vari-
ety reflects the nation's richness. What this
means for the average Indian child, however,
is that by the age of 10, she will have taken
classes for dance, Indian percussion, sing-
ing or any other traditional Indian art form.
Most often, families try to retain a style or
form of art that has trickled through the
family tree. For instance, if one's mother
and grandmother danced, it is likely that the
third generation of children will be enrolled
in dance classes, despite their own inclina-
tions. In my case, since my mother had been
a Bharat Natayam dancer, and my father had
played the synthesizer, I grew up dabbling in
both dancing and singing.
Since my father came from a deeply cul-
tured, artsy Indian family, I too, began learn-

ing about Indian music early. My informal each year.

the next time I visited.
I hadn't sungforthreeyearswhen I visited
my mother country again this past summer.
I had nearly forgotten how to hold a note for
longer than a minute, a feat which, five years
earlier, seemed much easier. So, naturally,
when my aunt, who learns music regularly,
asked me if I wanted to join her to observe
her music class, I was hesitant. How would
I be able to understand the tempos? What if
they asked me to join in? I wasn't prepared
to sing, but my aunt said coolly, "Come. It'll
be good for you to hear some good Indian
music." I couldn't resist or rather, didn't have
the motivation to, so I agreed to accompany
her, rather unwillingly.
The singing guru's home was a short
five-minute motorcycle ride away, and as
we entered the tiny two-roomed home, a
gruff-looking bearded man ushered us in.
An oblong wooden instrument resembling
a ukulele with a long fingerboard lay in the
corner, ready to be picked up and played by
its owner. For the first five minutes, my aunt
and her guru began with warm-ups - arpeg-
gios, or raagas, ranging from the simplest
two-note patterns, to more intricate combi-
nations of notes. Hearing the various tones
and the brilliant combinations reminded
me of trekking through a mountain with
twisted turns carved into it. The tones com-
bined in just the right places, but there was
an element of mystery in that it was impos-
sible to predict the following combination
of notes. Gradually, their voices gained
momentum, blending together in just the
right way, yet retaining their unique traits;
the sound assumed a more definitive pattern
of tones as the song progressed. I realized
that it was fused with particular sentiments,
and that the unique ways the tones merged
and diverged tugged at specific emotions. I
became engrossed in the song's melody, felt
the need to catch every fleeting note and
process its perfect timbre, rhythm and tone,
just before it transformed into a new one.
Listening to them sing together - their per-
fect blend of voices - touched me, and I was
reminded of my childhood sessions learning
music from my aunt. Then, too, I had been
enamored of the magnitude of music. I had
realized how music can stir and connect
souls, even those oceans apart. By the time
of the class' close, I was emotionally charged
from the beautiful performance, and I decid-
ed that I needed to start singing again.

DUST &
London, 1945.
The war was over.
He walked along the border of Regent's Park
with his hands tucked in his trouser pockets.
It was dark already, but then, it had never been
light - a thick fog hovered around the street-
lights, nestling close to the ruins of what had
once been the aviary of the London Zoo. It was
not the first time that he had walked this way,1
but every day it was a challenge. Before the war,
he had set himself goals for each morning: run
the circumference of Hyde Park, run from St.
Paul's to Grosvenor Square and back. Now he
had set the no-less heroic goal of walking past
the London Zoo, calmly and without thought.
Someday, perhaps, he would manage it. The
remains of the building were only brick and
mortar, but he smelled sulfur and manure and
something musky that made his stomach turn.
HIe longed for a drink to settle it, but it was only
three in the afternoon. Too early for a pint, even
by London's standards.
He turned up the collar of his coat. The wind
blew cold, hinting at snow somewhere past the
Tower, biding its time across the Thames. He
pudged a crumbled piece of brick with his toe,
ing the pressure of destruction against his
ot. It must have been an amazing sight, when
Germans dropped the air-raid bombs on
viary. Flashes of gold and red and orange
he fireworks on Bonfire day, pinpricked
o h with the jewel tones of exotic feath-
e -rald and turquoise and violet. Feathers
ted the dust, driftwood and seaweed
ne alo y the tide. Feathers, riding like tiny
ts witho passengers along the Thames to
ea.
