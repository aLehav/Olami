After 
three 
decades 
of 

minority 
student 
activism 

and 
ultimately, 
organizing 

for a more centrally located 
multicultural 
center 
and 

more emphasis on students 
of color at the University, 
the University of Michigan 
broke 
ground 
Wednesday 

morning 
at 
the 
William 

Monroe Trotter Multicultural 
Center’s new location on State 
Street. Alumni and students 
representing the Black Action 
Movement, 
#BBUM 
and 

current members of the Black 
Student Union gathered along 
with administrators at the 

construction site with shovels 
in hand at the spot north of the 
Michigan Union and between 
the Kelsey Museum and Betsy 
Barbour Residence.

The 
groundbreaking 

comes 
four 
years 
after 

#BBUM movement demands 
revitalized student requests 
for a more centrally located 
Trotter Center. Recent alum 
Logan Pratt, Trotter Student 
Advisory Committee member 
and 
former 
historian 
and 

academic concerns chair of the 
Black Student Union, recalled 
his time advocating for the 
building.

With United States House 

Republicans 
introducing 
a 

sweeping plan for tax reform 
last Thursday that outlined a set 
of tax cuts for businesses and 
a restructuring of the income 
tax system, students became 
concerned — especially because 
the bill contains a number of 
changes to the current tax code, 
some of which may directly 
impact college affordability.

The bill would eliminate two 

of three existing tax credits for 
students: the Lifetime Learning 
Credit and the Hope Scholarship 
Credit. The Lifetime Learning 
Credit offsets 20 percent of 
the first $10,000 of education 
expenses for individuals making 
$65,000 or less annually. The 
Hope Scholarship Credit offers 
a $2,500 credit for individuals 
making $80,000 or less annually. 
Cutting these two programs is 
estimated to save the government 
$17.3 billion in the next decade.

The American Opportunity 

Tax Credit — the third student 
credit — is expanded in the new 
bill. This offers a $2,500 credit 
every year for four years to people 
who spend $4,000 or more on 
tuition and fees annually. With 
the new bill, the program would 
be available to students for a 
fifth year with a reduced $1,250 
credit. This program cost the 
government nearly $18 billion 
in 2016, making it roughly ten 
times as costly as the other two 

combined.

Advocates of the bill argue 

new federal programs negate the 
need for these credits, which were 
created before any significant 
federal student loan repayment 
plan was available. The Obama-
era 
student 
loan 
repayment 

program would stay in place under 
the proposed plan. This program 
allows students to apply for 
federal loan aid, which is doled out 
depending on income. In general, 
the program caps the amount paid 
by students at 10 percent of their 

discretionary income. Individual 
plans offer loan forgiveness after 
25 years. More than five million 
people are currently paying back 
their loans with this program.

The 
Obama-era 
program, 

however, does not cover loans 
from private lenders, which make 
up 9 percent of all student loans 
for the current school year.

The GOP plan also eliminates 

the tax-exempt status of tuition 
reimbursements up to $5,250 a 
year, meaning that they would be 
taxed as income. Students whose 

education is funded by employers 
will be affected by this change.

In the view of LSA senior Grant 

Strobl—chairman of conservative 
Young Americans for Freedom— 
the economic benefits of an 
education negate the need for 
the tax credits and deductions 
changed in the bill. He said the 
return on investment of a college 
degree is far greater than its cost.

Approximately 17 University 

of 
Michigan 
students, 

representing 
various 
student 

organizations, will be attending 
the first national conference 
hosted by Students Organize 
for Syria this weekend at Loyola 
University Chicago to discuss 
solutions and raise awareness 
for the thousands of people who 
have died and millions who have 
been displaced as a result of 
violent oppression and civil war 
in Syria.

SOS, a national student-led 

movement that aims to spread 
awareness, assist and stand in 
solidarity with the Syrian people, 
focuses on fundraising, human 
rights advocacy and education. It 
has chapters at several colleges 
and 
universities, 
including 

the University of Michigan, 
the 
University 
of 
Southern 

California and the University of 
Florida, among others; most of 
which will be represented at the 
conference.

Students and administrators weigh measures on free speech & accountability

One year after the introduction 

of the five-year strategic plan for 
diversity, equity and inclusion, 
students, 
faculty 
and 
staff 

gathered Wednesday evening to 
evaluate the plan’s effectiveness.

Most students in attendance 

at the summit — about 50 total 
— were members of Central 
Student Government or student 
advisory boards related to the 
DEI or the Office of Student Life. 
The evening kicked off with 
an introduction from Central 

Student Government President 
Anushka Sarkar, an LSA senior, 
followed by Robert Sellers, vice 
provost for Equity and Inclusion. 
Both 
speakers 
stressed 
the 

idea of creating a safe campus 
community for all students.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president 
for

called on values-based problem 

solving.

“When times are tough and 

you’re up against a wall, that’s 
when you have to live and act 
your values or else they’re 
meaningless,” Harper said.

Awareness Center’s 32nd annual 
Speak Out were greeted by an 
atmosphere full of fairy lights, 
candles and the soft chords of 
Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide” 
this Wednesday night in the 
Michigan Union Ballroom. The 
organizers of the event said they 
created this ambience to make a 
safe space for survivors of sexual 
assault to share their stories.

LSA senior Nora Akcasu, a 

SAPAC volunteer and one of the 
main organizers of the event, 
said making the ballroom feel 
more inviting was something 
new SAPAC focused on this year.

“This year we really tried to 

emphasize making the space 
feel 
more 
comfortable,” 
she 

said. “The ballroom is such a big 
space, and we don’t want people 
to feel more intimidated than 
they already are to go up there 
and share this deeply personal 
story.”

Women who served in the military speak on overcoming sexist stereo-
types and sexual harassment at the Union Wednesday.

VETE R ANS MONTH

Former JetBlue CEO Dave 

Barger, who previously attended 
the University of Michigan, gave a 
$10 million gift to the University’s 
Barger Leadership Institute, an 
initiative to promote research 
opportunities for LSA students.

This gift comes 10 years 

after the foundational donation 
he made to create the institute. 
This 10th-anniversary gift is 
intended to expand and sustain the 
opportunities the institute gives to 
student leaders.

“It’s a great honor to be able 

to continue to support the (Barger 
Leadership Institute) and to help 
expand experiential opportunities 
for the next generation of leaders,” 
Barger said in a news release. 
“Michigan excels at preparing 
undergraduate students to 
contribute as well-rounded, 
forward-thinking leaders, and it’s a 
privilege to be able to support this 
important work.”

The $4.5 million gift Barger 

gave in 2007 to begin the institute 
has gone toward forming new clubs, 
developing startup companies, 

seeking global and domestic 
internships, partnering with on- 
and off-campus organizations, and 
learning professional skills that can 
be applied post-graduation.

Public Policy junior Zoha 

Qureshi, a BLI program 
coordinator, said the institute has 
been crucial to her development 
as a leader, and she has benefited 
immensely from Barger’s 
commitment and resources.

“With this generous gift, BLI 

will be able to provide even more 
resources to support students in 
their passions and interests. This 
gift will help us include more access 
opportunities to visit places all 
around the globe, more networking 
events to gain valuable, professional 
connections, and more workshops 
to promote individual growth,” 
Qureshi said. “BLI stresses that 
leadership is something that can be 
learned by anyone. With this ability 
to expand, we can make that vision 
a reality for all University of 
Michigan students.”

Barger has given more 

than $18 million to LSA, 

Athletics, University Libraries, 
Michigan Medicine and the 
Alumni Association since 1987. 
His donations have gone on to 
create programs like the Barger 
Family Professorship and the 
JetBlue Airways London School of 
Economics Summer Program.

This gift also creates the 

Richard. H. Price Founders 
Fund, named after the institute’s 
founding director, which provides 
the director with funds to start 
programs for students.

Five years ago, East Quad 

Residence 
Hallunderwent 

comprehensive 
renovations, 

sporting 
new 
study 
spaces, 

improved restrooms and a new 
430-person dining hall.

Since that renovation, the East 

Quad dining hall has been a quick 
stop for meals for students around 
campus due to its convenient 
location and sustainable meals, 
as well as a huge improvement 
for students in the University of 
Michigan’s Residential College, 
a 
living-learning 
community 

housed in East Quad.

Recently, however, concerns 

have been raised to East Quad 

Hall Council regarding the size 
of the dorm. With nearly 900 
students, LSA freshman Jaylen 
Bradley, president of the Quad 
council, says the expansiveness 
of East Quad has led to some 
issues the council hopes to 
address, especially with regard 
to the dining hall. 

The council, made up of 

15 students and two faculty 
advisers, has been drafting a 
petition for the past month to 
submit to MDining about the 
hours.

“I was approached by several 

of our residents saying how 
the hours were inconvenient,” 
Bradley said.

East Quad’s dining hall is 

open for breakfast and lunch 
from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.; for dinner 
from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.; and on 

the weekends, 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 
p.m. for breakfast and lunch, and 
again 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. for dinner. 
The council is petitioning for 
longer lunches, longer dinners 
and earlier breakfast on the 
weekends to accommodate the 
growing demands from residents.

“I need everyone to understand 

that this is an ongoing process. 
It takes time to make sure 
everything is aligned,” Bradley 
said. “Although our residents feel 
like we’re not doing anything, 
we are and it’s just behind the 
scenes.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Sage 

Renstrom-Richards has lived in 
East Quad for the past two years. 

“I go to the dining hall at least 

three times a day,” Renstrom-
Richards said. “I usually get 
second dinner because I know 

that they have a very limited 
window to get dinner.”

Like many students, late 

nights are often a part of the 
collegiate 
experience, 
and 

with late nights comes the 
desire for late-night snacks.

“At MSU, they have ‘late-

night 
something,’ 
where 

the dining hall is open and 
only has limited options. It’s 
good because it recognizes 
the fact that you don’t stop 
getting hungry after 8 p.m.” 
Renstrom-Richards said.

The late opening times 

for 
the 
dining 
halls 
on 

the weekends can also be 
inconvenient for students, she 
said.

“I also work on weekends 

and a lot of my work starts 
at 10, so I literally cannot 
eat 
breakfast,” 
Renstrom-

Richards 
said. 
“It 
really 

disadvantages 
people 
who 

need to work, which is a 
problem.”

This is for the Asian/Pacific 

Islander 
American 
social 

justice 
community 
at 
the 

University of Michigan — the 
people who have become my 
family.

Dear Family,
The time I’ve spent with 

Asian-American 
men 
who 

claim to be so “intersectional 
feminist” has proven we’re 
clearly standing at the wrong 
intersections. 
Because 
for 

boys 
who 
call 
themselves 

“involved in the community” 
of A/PIA activists, who hold 
high 
positions 
in 
A/PIA 

social 
justice 
and 
cultural 

organizations, they seem to 
have forgotten that you can be 
A/PIA and be a woman at the 
same time. I’ve spent so many 
late nights with other women 
in this community, whispering 
about a comment made on 
their sexuality by a boy who 
brands himself as “trying to 
be cognizant of his privilege.” 
And yet, that’s the whole 
point: we whisper. Because 
any 
attempt to open 
this 

conversation has been brushed 
over with performative nods 
of agreement and assuring us 
they’re trying their best. But 
I don’t fuck with the Social 
Justice Warrior label being 
used as a point of pride and a 
defense; this conversation does 
not belong on the sidelines 
between women in hushed 
voices anymore.

Dear Family,
These microaggressions that 

manifest into jokes and side 
comments matter. Laughing at 
a girl for telling you that she 
abstained from sex will impact 
her self-esteem and might 

drive her to make decisions 
she doesn’t completely want to 
make. Calling girls “trashy” for 
being in a sorority is not only 
condescending, it’s objectively 
wrong. If your friend tells you 
she doesn’t want to be felt 
up at a party, saying “what’s 
the big deal?” is incredibly 
disrespectful to her personal 
autonomy. And it seems so 
ridiculous to say these things 
to people who are supposed 
to know this already, yet it 
is somehow still necessary. 
Because 
these 
comments 

evolve into reputations, and 
reputations 
create 
impacts, 

whether 
being 
denied 

leadership positions, not being 
taken seriously in academic 
settings or losing confidence 
in your own work and general 
self-esteem.

Dear Family,
In 
a 
community 
where 

women care just as much, work 
just as hard and sometimes 
know twice as much as their 
male counterparts, they put 
up with receiving half the 
credit, especially in large A/
PIA organizations. Women in 
these spaces are constantly 
treated as if we’re just working 
on a fun social justice project, 
rather than doing the same 
work that the men are doing. 
We’re told our visibility “isn’t a 
problem like it used to be,” and 
that plenty of places are run 
by women now, so obviously 
the problem has been solved. 
Men 
leading 
organizations 

expect to be applauded every 
time they mention supporting 
women of color, but constantly 
ignore, diminish and push 
aside the work women in 
their own organizations do. 
They claim to be allies while 
talking 
over 
us, 
repeating 

points we have already made, 

belittling the efforts we put in 
and conveniently forgetting to 
give credit where credit is due. 
They think they’ve worked for 
everything they have while 
completely 
forgetting 
the 

support they’ve received from 
women of color along the way. 
And social justice is not an 
area you have to know the most 
about at all times, but in terms 
of leadership, some women 
are more qualified than some 
men to answer questions and 
explain concepts, yet don’t 
earn the same respect men do 
in this community.

Dear Family,
I am worried this will be 

brushed off as just another 
one of those feminist things. 
I especially don’t want the 
applause from white pussy 
hat-wearing 
feminists, 

because this is pertaining to a 
community that has been hurt 
by white privilege as well. But 
I’m worried the conversation 
among ourselves will conclude, 
yes, 
of 
course 
we 
should 

respect women, but then die 
out when it comes to making 
concrete action.

Dear Family,
I have so much love for this 

group of people, and I am 
proud of what we are trying to 
achieve. But it is not acceptable 
for these women to put in the 
work without receiving the 
recognition. It’s not acceptable 
that so many of them feel 
badly about their own choices 
or sexualities because some 
boy told them they should be 
ashamed. So it’s definitely 
not acceptable for men in this 
community to read through 
this article and not make 
strides for concrete change.

Dear Family,
I love you, but we have some 

work to do.

When people learn that I am 

half-Chinese the reaction is like 
watching 
someone 
figure 
out 

that math problem they had been 
stuck on: some mixture of a new 
revelation and old knowledge that 
they finally combined. It’s as if my 
race is some ambiguous thing to 
be discovered. I’m exotic looking, 
vaguely ethnic, somehow different 
— I’m not quite white. 

With this, in the years I spent in 

majority white institutions I got the 
full spectrum of Asian jokes and 
stereotypes.

“Well, of course you got an A.”
“But your mom made you take 

SAT prep courses didn’t she?”

“You’re a woman and Asian? 

You must be the worst driver on the 
road.”

“You know, I’ve never been with 

an Asian girl before.”

When I was younger this was 

strange to me. I lived my first nine 
years in America, how was I not 
fully American? Everyone around 
me was white, my dad was white, 
my grandparents were: I didn’t 
quite understand what it meant to 
be Chinese.

***
At age 6 I visited China for the 

first time. My mom’s family lived 
in a small town called Kangbao, 
where my laolao and laoye lived in a 
small mud-brick house. There was 
one large bed that we all shared 
and the pillows were hard and 
filled with beans. My laoye was a 
traditional Chinese doctor, though 
he was forced to stop practicing 
during the Cultural Revolution. My 
uncle raised sheep, which he let us 
chase around with the dogs. My 
grandparents didn’t have internet, 
so my sisters and I passed time 
watching “Mei Hou Wang” or 
Chinese “Tom and Jerry.” 

In that small town, I was a 

celebrity. One day my sister and I 
attempted to sit in on a day of classes 
at the local school, but eventually 
were asked to leave, as we were 
a novelty deemed too distracting 
to the students, who refused to do 
class work in lieu of staring at us. 
Later, some of the students would 
track us down and ask for pieces of 
our hair to keep to remember us. 

Walking down the street people 

would stare and shout: 

Wai guo ren!
Foreigner. 
***
By the time I was a teenager, 

I had grown used to my Chinese 
identity, and understood what that 
meant in the mostly-white suburbs 
of Michigan. I was not white. Here 
I was the Chinese girl, and that was 
fine. 

At age 15, my move to China 

should have felt like a move home — 
it was anything but. Suddenly I was 
surrounded by people who were 
more Chinese than me. Despite 
being at an international school, I 
had many American-born Chinese, 
Taiwanese and Hong Kongese 
peers. To them I was one of the 
“white kids” and with that there 
was an ingrained social hierarchy. 

The white kids were the popular 

ones. They went to bars and clubs 
on the weekends (foreigners are 
never asked for ID, even if they look 
15). They didn’t try very hard in 
school. They took fewer AP classes. 
They went to less prestigious 
universities. 

The 
Asian 
kids 
were 
the 

intellectually superior ones. They 
took SAT prep courses on the 
weekends. They participated in 
a variety of clubs and did charity 
work on the side. They aimed for 
the Ivy leagues. 

I hovered in the middle. Not 

white, not Asian. 

Among my white friends I was 

one of the “smartest” in the friend 
group. I went out with them less 
often in order to prepare for exams 
or the SATs. With my Asian friends, 
I was more of a slacker. I applied to 
Michigan with the intent to attend, 
not as a dreaded safety school.

In both groups, I existed on the 

margins. Drifting in between, with 
friends on both sides, but never 
really feeling at home in either. 

***
At home, my family jokes that 

I am the “whitest” daughter. 
My Mandarin is the worst (I am 
functionally illiterate and scarcely 
conversational), I don’t eat meat, 
excluding me from a variety of 
traditional foods, and most of all 
I “act white” — something hard 
to define, but easily recognizable 
when you understand it. 

Ironically, I am also the most 

“Asian” looking of my sisters. 
When alone or with just my 
mother, people often assume that 
I am simply Chinese. In Shanghai, 
people would always immediately 
speak to me in Mandarin and 
consequently look disappointed 
in 
my 
grammatically 
horrific 

response. My family often remarks 
at how similar I look to my mother 
when she was this age. 

***
At the University of Michigan 

and across the country, racial 
tensions are high. Hatred and 
bigotry walk the streets unafraid of 
consequences. People of color need 
support now more than ever. 

In the Ford School of Public 

Policy, there is a group specifically 
for students of color, but I’m 
not sure if I should join. Despite 
knowing my own identity as an 
Asian woman, I and others don’t 
always see me as a person of color. 

In 
discussions 
of 
diversity, 

I’m often overlooked. Last week, 
when someone I work with was 
criticizing low diversity numbers in 
leadership in our organization, she 
counted out two women of color — 
notably excluding me. However, at 
other times, I have been told that 
I am obviously a person of color. 
I had a friend who told me that I 
would always be identified first 
as Chinese before anything else 
because my minority identification 
would always hinder me. 

My face is ambiguous — vaguely 

ethnic, somehow different. People 
are unsure where to categorize 
me — hell, sometimes neither do 
I. Most forms only allow you to 
choose one option when it comes 
to race, so every time I must choose 
between those two boxes I must 
choose how I want to identity 
myself: white or Asian? 

At times, I also cannot relate to 

the same experiences as some other 
people of color. I generally do not 
face discrimination based on my 
appearance or encounter racism on 
a daily basis. Because of this, I feel 
like I cannot always fully identify 
with other students of color, and it 
causes me to fear that they do not 
fully accept me as a person of color. 

With 
every 
discussion 
of 

diversity and every group for 
students of color, I face anxiety 
and uncertainty over whether or 
not others will see me as a person 
of color. Despite knowing my own 
experiences and interacting with 
my Chinese culture everyday, this 
fear of not being respected as a 
person of color is something I still 
struggle with. 

My identity as half-Chinese (or 

halfie or Wasain) is something I 
am incredibly grateful for, as my 
family life and cultural experiences 
have been so much richer because 
of it. Despite the challenges 
I enumerated, China and my 
heritage are incredibly important 
parts of my life that I would not 
change for the world. 

Being Black in a white world 

is 
exhausting. 
While 
other 

people get to live their lives, 
oblivious to instances of racial 
injustice, Black people are not 
afforded that same privilege. 
Several non-Black students did 
not know about any of the racist 
things on campus — the spray-
painted praise of Dylann Roof, 
the N-word written on various 
spaces and several racist posters 
— that occurred on campus 
before I mentioned them. While 
I lived my days in increasing fear 
and growing discomfort, they 
were unaware that anything 
was even going on. While I 
remain slightly on edge because 
I don’t know who among my 
peers would love for me to not 
be at this school, or who would 
casually call me a n-----, I also 
have the burden of having to 
teach people about what is and 
what isn’t racism, on the daily.

Frankly, 
I’m 
annoyed 

constantly 
teaching 
people 

about what racism actually is. Do 
you know how frustrating it is to 
teach person after person about 
history that they could easily just 
look up? On one hand, I am happy 
to help shed light on issues that 
people may otherwise not have 
thought about, but on the other 
hand, it gets tiring. I’m tired of 
having to explain to you why the 
Confederate flag is a symbol of 
the heritage and history of hate. 
I’m tired of having to explain to 
you why me calling you a racist is 
not nearly as bad as you actually 
doing something racist. I’m tired 
of having to explain to you that 
racism lies much deeper than 

skin. You having one Black friend 
does not mean that you’re not 
racist. Just because you smiled at 
a Black person one time when you 
were 5, doesn’t excuse the fact 
that you yell n---- at frat parties 
when rap songs come on. Calling 
yourself an ally yet continuing 
to let racist friends and family 
be racist does not help anyone, 
and acting as if you’re colorblind 
certainly does not help me. But 
I don’t have the time to tell you 
this. Not when your president 
doesn’t value Black lives. I don’t 
have time to explain to you why 
your tendency to read anger into 
anything I say is supporting a 
negative stereotype when I have 
to go to a march to let people 
know that I will never let them 
forget, pretend or ignore the 
fact that my life matters. I can’t 
assuage your white guilt when 
I have to follow the news day in 
and day out because yet another 
unarmed Black person was shot 
by a police officer, and I want 
to know if they’ll finally get 
justice this time, though I know 
that is often not the case. When 
you’re trying to pretend that 
your 
Confederate-flag-owning 

relatives aren’t supporting a 
history of hate, I’m trying my 
hardest to not be upset by white 
friends who I know mean well, 
but still can’t really see white 
privilege.

Bottom line: I don’t always 

have time to be your teacher. It’s 
difficult, stifling and annoying 
to always have to sugarcoat 
what I need to tell you about 
your varying degrees of racist 
actions. Instead of flat out telling 
you that the #AllLivesMatter 
movement is racist because it 
exists to overshadow the point 
of #BlackLivesMatter, I must 

coddle you by saying, “I know 
you mean well, and I’m glad you 
want to be an ally, but all lives 
already matter, yet according 
to the cops...” I must be the 
politest, and the gentlest in my 
wording, or else you won’t even 
hear my point because you hear 
“racist” and think, “You called 
me racist — how dare you?” As 
a result of the systemic racism 
that has infected this country, 
each day I have some form of 
injustice to be upset by, but 
when I want to convey this to 
you, my words must be gentle 
as a lamb, even though you 
weren’t so gentle when you said 
Colin Kaepernick was dumb for 
kneeling and “protesting the 
flag” (fun fact: That isn’t what 
he was protesting). My words 
must be soft, and carefully 
chosen, so as not to upset the 
white person who is struggling 
to admit to their own racism, 
which is maddening because it 
quiets what I would prefer to yell 
from the rooftops: Yes, you may 
not believe me but this is indeed 
racist! I’m tired of policing my 
words to help to you realize what 
is and isn’t racist. My world, 
in terms of racial injustice, is 
difficult, jarring and sometimes 
scary, and yet the world has to be 
insulated for you.

I do not want to be your 

teacher, but despite this, I know 
that I must continue to be it. I 
can’t let people go on not being 
aware of their own racism, even 
if it drains me to repeatedly 
teach them. Despite loving the 
empowered feeling that I get 
from being Black and socially 
aware, I’m tired of the burden 
being placed on me to teach 
people who don’t want to be 
educated.

“That baby is so white,” 

a stranger said aloud at the 
grocery store, alarmed at the 
sight of a dark Southeast Asian 
man carrying a pale baby 
girl. It was 1998, potentially 
1999. I wish I had my own 
recollection of that day, but 
the “white baby” was me.

This day was nevertheless 

interesting. It was the day I 
became known as “the white 
girl” in my family, something 
that oddly stuck with me 
throughout the years, growing 
up as a Filipino-American kid. 
It was my alternate identity, 
like my own weird version of 
Hannah Montana to Miley 
Stewart.

Both of my parents are 

Filipino and came to the 
United States shortly before 
I was born. I grew up hearing 
them speak Bisaya (a Filipino 
dialect), but I was almost 
exclusively spoken and read to 
in English.

From 
very 
early 
on, 

I 
identified 
as 
Filipino 

American. But as the years 
passed, this identity of mine 
became 
confusing, 
and 
at 

times it diverged into two 
separate entities that clashed.

Flash forward to 2003. “Bye, 

my palangga,” my mom said as 
I took my first step onto the 
school bus for my first day of 
kindergarten. At the time, I 
didn’t know what “palangga” 
meant (later on, I learned that 
it meant “beloved”). I was 
reading and speaking English 
at a second-grade level, but my 
Bisaya vocabulary was limited 
to common household words, 
pet 
names 
and 
frustrated 

exclamations. 
Occasionally, 

my parents would put on 
“Mga Awit Bulilit,” a DVD 
of Filipino children’s music 
videos. 
I 
sang 
along 
to 

“Bahay Kubo” and “Pen Pen 
de Sarapen” religiously by 
reading the Tagalog subtitles. 
I never learned the English 
lyrics. Nor did I ever learn the 
difference between Bisaya and 
Tagalog, the most commonly 
spoken 
language 
in 
the 

Philippines.

In 
fourth 
grade, 
I 
sat 

down at the sticky cafeteria 
table and excitedly opened 

my 
lunch, 
ginaling 
with 

white rice. “That looks like 
dog food,” my best friend 
muttered. “Is that Chinese? 
Aren’t you Chinese?” a boy 
asked. “I’m Filipino,” I said for 
the 100th time, not sure why 
I even bothered to explain it 
again. I knew I would be met 
with “What’s that?” and “Can 
you teach me words in your 
language?”

“I 
can’t 
really 
speak 

it,” I would say, followed 
by 
expressions 
of 

disappointment. 
“My 

language” was English. How 
could I teach my friends a 
language that was practically 
foreign to me?

At 
school, 
I 
was 
the 

stereotypical Asian kid who 
usually did well in school, 
had strict parents, took off my 
shoes upon entering the house 
and ate “weird” food with a 
fork and spoon instead of a 
knife and fork.

But at family gatherings, 

I 
was 
the 
whitewashed, 

Americanized 
girl 
who 

couldn’t understand Tagalog 
or Bisaya and was unaware 
of what life was like in the 
Philippines. My aunts, uncles 
and 
cousins 
would 
speak 

drawn-out sentences in Bisaya 
and tell me to respond. “I 
can’t really speak it,” I would 
say, followed by the same 
disappointed looks I would 
get 
from 
my 
classmates. 

Only these stabbed harder. 
They came from people who 
knew what they were talking 
about, while I didn’t know 
a thing. Even if I slightly 
understood what they said, I 
always hesitated to respond, 
fearful 
of 
butchering 
the 

pronunciations.

I 
already 
had 
enough 

criticisms constantly hanging 
over my head: “You need to get 
a tan,” “Why didn’t you ever 
learn Bisaya?” “Your hair is so 
thick, it looks so unkempt.” I 
didn’t care to be reminded of 
my other perceived flaws that 
made me “less Filipino.”

From a young age, my fair 

skin, unruly brown hair and 
language inabilities made me 
feel like an outsider in my own 
family. To my peers unaware 
of 
Filipinos 
and 
Filipino 

culture, I felt like an imposter. 
I confused myself with the 
ideas of not being Filipino 

enough, not being American 
enough or being too much or 
too little of either.

It was only recently that 

I finally became completely 
comfortable with the identity 
I had assumed in the very 
beginning: Filipino American.

My advice to anyone else 

who has felt like an outsider 
in your family, an imposter 
to your friends or both: You 
aren’t.

I know, it’s really frustrating 

to hear your mom gossiping 
about you over the phone to 
your aunt in a language you 
can’t even understand. Yes, 
it’s irritating when people ask 
you to speak words “in your 
language” or ask, “Where are 
you really from?”

I could go on and on about 

the annoyances (and there 
are many more I haven’t 
experienced 
and 
therefore 

can’t speak on).

In spite of them, your 

identity is yours, and it can’t 
be altered by other people’s 
perceived notions of “less.”

You are not “less” of a person 

because of the languages you 
can or can’t speak, the color of 
your skin, the texture of your 
hair, the food you eat or the 
way you eat it.

You are your own complete 

person, and while you may not 
always be able to speak for 
other people who share your 
identities, you also shouldn’t 
always let other people speak 
for you.

I am Filipino American. 

I eat my ginaling, sinigang, 
adobo and rice with a fork 
and spoon. I know every song 
on the “Hannah Montana” 
soundtrack, the words to “The 
Star-Spangled Banner” and 
the tune of the Philippine 
national anthem, among other 
great music pieces.

When I graduate from this 

American university, I hope to 
one day visit the Philippines 
and contribute to the place 
my parents once called home. 
One day, I will be able to hold 
a conversation in Filipino 
— not only to respond to my 
relatives’ gossips about me 
but also to reach another 
population 
of 
people 
and 

connect more closely with my 
culture.

I am still growing and 

learning, but I am enough.

Filipino American, enough

By 
allowing 
Richard 

Spencer to speak on campus, 
the Editorial Board believes 
the University would offer 
a 
platform 
for 
Spencer 

to 
spread 
legitimate 
hate 

speech. Spencer advocates for 
the establishment of a “white 
‘ethno-state,’” 
“peaceful 

ethnic cleansing” and has 
adopted 
Nazi 
terminology 

for 
the 
press. 

Though 
hate 

speech is hard to 
define, we believe 
Spencer’s speech 
poses a reasonable 
threat to public 
safety. 
Spencer’s 

speech has incited 
rampant violence 
in 
the 
past, 

most notably in 
Charlottesville, 
Va., last August, 
when 
Heather 

Heyer 
died 

protesting 
at 

a 
Unite 
the 

Right 
rally 

which 
Spencer 

organized. 
Furthermore, 
Florida Gov. Rick 
Scott 
called 
a 

state of emergency 
when 
Spencer 

spoke on the campus of the 
University of Florida in October. 
Allowing Spencer to speak 
would also be contradictory 
to the University’s diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion 

ideals. We cannot condone 
the 
immorality 
(and 

irresponsibility) of providing a 
platform for white supremacist 
views at our University.

Due to the protections of 

free speech under the First 
Amendment, simply denying 
Spencer an opportunity to 
speak will likely spark a 
legal battle. Other prominent 
public universities, such as 

Michigan 
State 
University 

and Penn State University, 
currently find themselves in 
lawsuits initiated by Spencer 
after denying his request to 
speak. His behavior can be 
categorized 
as 
attention-

seeking, and until firm legal 
precedent is established, his 
tactics will continue from 
university to university. 

Therefore, not only is this an 
opportunity to take direct 
action against hate speech, 
but to fight alongside other 
universities 
in 
developing 

a legal weapon to prevail 
against 
these 
reactive 

lawsuits. 
The 
University 

can work to set new legal 
precedents 
that 
would 

likely help protect smaller 
universities that may not be 
able to afford hefty legal fees.

We 
acknowledge 
that 

even if the University were 
to forcefully fight to keep 
Spencer off campus, he may 
still prevail. The lawsuit is 

risky, as the University could 
relinquish all control they 
may have over scheduling 
Spencer’s 
visit. 
Measures 

like 
scheduling 
Spencer’s 

potential speech during a 
restrictive time — such as 
over a school break — and in a 
less central venue on campus 
may not be possible in the 
case of a lost lawsuit.

However, as 

the 
Editorial 

Board 
has 

written 
about 

in 
the 
past, 

the 
string 
of 

racist 
actions 

on 
campus 

has 
harmed 

the 
perception 

of 
campus 

safety 
and 

inclusivity, and 
the 
University 

should 
show 

unrelenting 
solidarity 
with 
minority 

students in the 
current political 
climate. 
The 

University 
needs to match 
its 
rhetoric 

of 
student 

solidarity 

and inclusiveness with its 
actions. Accepting Spencer’s 
speaking request will only 
add fuel to the fire of a 
troublingly hostile climate. 
Regardless, the University 
needs 
to 
be 
proactive, 

whether by legal measures 
or security, in protecting 
our 
campus 
and 
our 

students from intentional 
and degrading hate speech 
and an inf lux of dangerous 
white 
supremacists 

organizing on campus.

I 

suffer 
from 
Raynaud’s 

disease, an autoimmune 
disease in which blood 

vessels 
in 
my 
hands 
and 

feet 
spasm 
due 
to 
cold 

temperatures, 
causing 
a 

temporary decrease in blood 
supply. 
With 
Raynaud’s, 

sensitivity 
to 
temperature 

varies from person to person. 
Typically, I can experience 
symptoms at temperatures 65 
degrees or lower if I am not 
bundled up. There is no cure 
for Raynaud’s disease, but if 
I wear appropriate clothing 
and am careful about touching 
cold objects, I can live a fairly 
normal life. 

In my early teens, I began to 

lose my hearing. Being hard of 
hearing is difficult, but because 
I don’t need an American 
Sign 
Language 
translator 

and my hearing aids are not 
very 
visible, 
most 
people 

don’t realize that I’m hard of 
hearing. Once I was diagnosed 
with these two ailments, I did 
not have much of an idea as 
to what to do since I had not 
learned about these issues in a 
health class or at home.

Raynaud’s disease and being 

hard of hearing are examples of 
a larger spectrum of illnesses 
called “invisible disabilities.” 
An 
invisible 
disability 
can 

be 
described 
as 
primarily 

neurological but encompasses 
all disabilities that are not 
seen 
by 
others. 
They 
are 

often incurable. In addition 
to 
autoimmune 
diseases 

and 
visual 
and 
auditory 

impairments, 
an 
invisible 

disability can include mental 
health 
problems, 
sleeping 

disorders or chronic pain.

Among 
college 
students, 

invisible disabilities are more 
common 
than 
one 
would 

think. 
Seventy-five 
percent 

mental health disorders begin 
before the age of 24, making 
college a trying time for some. 

Additionally, 
mental 
illness 

is prevalent among college 
students. Twelve percent of 
freshman students said they 
were 
frequently 
depressed 

in 2016. For these reasons, 
increasing 
awareness 
of 

invisible disabilities, especially 
among teens and young adults, 
is exceptionally important. 

Invisible 
disability 
narratives 

are not represented enough in 
current conversations. Taboo 
surrounds invisible disabilities, 
especially in regard to mental 
illness. This stigma prevents 
personal narratives from being 
displayed. Unfortunately, this 
leads to those with invisible 
disabilities not getting the care 
and treatment necessary to 
maintain good health.

This significantly decreases 

quality 
of 
life 
for 
those 

individuals. 
A 
2017 
USA 

Today 
article 
found 
that 

students 
who 
knew 
about 

mental health resources on 
their campus chose not to use 
them because of the negative 
stigma associated with mental 
health problems. With studies 
showing that the risk for 
suicide decreases substantially 
once one begins counseling, 
this stigma creates a deadly 
problem for those struggling 
with mental health. Those 
with an invisible disability, 
like mental health disorders or 
hearing limitations, deserve the 
resources and care necessary 
to improve their health so they 
can participate in society to 
their fullest capacity.

A 
lack 
of 
awareness 

surrounding 
invisible 

disabilities makes the disability 
itself seem fake. Because my 
disabilities are not apparent, 
I feel as if I constantly have 
to justify the struggles I face 
because of them. There is a 
common misconception that 
I am making up the pain from 
Raynaud’s or that I can actually 

hear fine but am just bad at 
paying attention. Neither of 
these are true.

Other 
comments 
I 
have 

received 
regarding 
my 

disabilities are usually along 
the lines of how I should be 
grateful, because “I could have 
it worse.” I have always found 
this type of rhetoric extremely 
offensive. 
These 
comments 

are a thinly veiled attempt at 
invalidating the pain that those 
with invisible disabilities face. 
While it is true the majority 
of invisible disabilities are not 
terminal, these limitations can 
severely affect one’s daily life.

To 
combat 
these 

misconceptions, I feel the need 
to educate others on my invisible 
disabilities. While I am happy 
to answer questions, it is not my 
job to combat people’s ignorance. 
With information at everyone’s 
fingertips, the burden should 
not be on those with invisible 
disabilities 
to 
educate 
the 

general population.

Increasing awareness through 

conversation is an important 
step in decreasing these types of 
offensive comments. Education 
is 
key 
in 
creating 
positive 

change in the world of invisible 
disabilities in particular and 
disabilities in general.

Invisible disabilities and the 

struggles they entail are real. I 
want to remind those on campus 
who struggle with an invisible 
disability to remember they 
are not alone and they deserve 
respect 
and 
the 
resources 

they need to succeed. As a 
university, we can support our 
peers with invisible disabilities 
by including them in our 
discussions about disability. 
I 
would 
encourage 
those 

without an invisible disability 
to educate themselves to be a 
good ally to those suffering.

A

s a senior, sometimes 
it seems like talking 
about plans has become 

as mundane as talking 
about the weather. 
The 
question 

“Remind me, what 
are 
you 
thinking 

of 
doing 
after 

graduation?” 
with 

all its monumentally 
stressful 
implications, 
seems 

to weasel its way 
into 
conversations 

on a near-daily basis. 
To this point, one response has 
made me furrow my brow every 
time: “Consulting.”

Based purely on specs, its 

appeal 
is 
understandable. 

According to best estimates, 
the industry’s profits totaled 
over $71 billion in 2016, with 
projections 
promising 
even 

more growth this year. In 
terms of experience gained, 
salaries for recent graduates, 
job security and esteem, few 
other industries can compete. 
But work of this sort in one’s 
20s or 30s is the ultimate 
case 
of 
putting 
the 
cart 

before the horse. In the end, 
its rise is taking some of the 
most talented young minds 
graduating from this university 
and others away from making 
actual change in the world.

First and foremost, the idea 

that the thousands of young 
people who enter this industry 
each year are all 
experts 

in business, politics, public 
health, finance, strategy or 
management 
is 
far-fetched, 

verging on absurd. Platitudes 
aside, 
the 
difference 
in 

educational value between the 
classroom and the real world 
is substantial. Of course, they 
have something to contribute 
after four years of learning, 
but why would a client pay 
for 
advice 
from 
someone 

with absolutely no practical 
experience? Where do newly 
minted graduates fit into a 
field centered on connecting 
experts with companies and 
campaigns in need? The senior 
members of these firms did 
not become experts from years 
as junior researchers — they 
did so by doing first and then 
finding a platform to share 

their knowledge. Trial and 
error, not apprenticeships.

Some 
of 
the 
country’s 

best and brightest 
choose, 
oddly 

enough, not to set 
themselves 
up 
to 

start a business or 
run a campaign of 
their own, but to 
help someone else 
make change in the 
world. And why not? 
It’s not as though 
each of them lacks 
a potential million-

dollar 
venture 
they 
toss 

around in the back of their 
minds as they fall asleep, a 
cause they’d like to champion 
or lend their voice to. 

Instead, it can be ascribed 

to the sense of security that 
accompanies 
continued 

achievement. Success is much 
easier to process when it is 
measured by “U.S. News and 
World Report,” or when you 
know that McKinsey, Bain, 
BCG and Deloitte will look 
phenomenal on a résumé and 
that your tenure there will 
be the envy of friends and 
relatives. Some have said these 
groups, nearly all of which 
began their consulting in the 
1970s and have experienced 
a meteoric rise from there, 
have succeeded in branding 
“themselves as a kind of Ivy 
League of adulthood.”

What no one has been able 

to explain to me to this point is 
what is all that exciting about 
consulting. 
Granted, 
there’s 

the opportunity to learn from 
an array of clients, and there 
is value in variety. But when 
thousands of companies are 
all going to the same five or 10 
firms to inform their decisions, 
that must eventually preclude 
variety. Not long ago, the chief 
executives of Boeing, General 
Electric, 
Hewlett-Packard, 

Morgan Stanley and PepsiCo 
were all alumni of the same 
three firms. It is a structure that 
seems reminiscent of the type of 
home improvement shows one 
might see on HGTV: a cookie-
cutter formula for change, but 
instead of open floor plans, wood 
finishes and rustic accents, it 
has to do with networking, 
PowerPoints and social media 

strategies. Ultimately, the final 
products look decently similar to 
one another.

So why not come up with a 

product that’s entirely your own 
while you’re young and have 
the chance to make mistakes? 
My guess is that in five, 10, 
20 years, as these minds are 
moving into nicer offices and 
starting families, these bright, 
young professionals will be 
significantly 
less 
likely 
to 

leave their world and take 
risks. Furthermore, if you are 
the type of person who honestly 
sees themselves with a career 
in 
consulting 
and 
nothing 

else, isn’t the more beneficial 
experience out there in the 
world? You might not settle 
down at McKinsey before you’re 
30, but by the time you do, you 
won’t be starting at entry level.

Meanwhile, 
the 
true 

innovators, the names that 
people 
will 
remember 
as 

the titans of their industries 
in the 21st century — Jobs, 
Gates, Buffett, Zuckerberg — 
have no experience in, and 
often distaste for, the world 
of consulting. In fact, Warren 
Buffett, the second-wealthiest 
man in the world, railed against 
the 
profession 
just 
a 
few 

months ago. At a shareholders’ 
meeting, the 84-year-old made 
a joke about the fact that “If 
the board hires a compensation 
consultant after I (die), I will 
come back — mad.”

Make no mistake. Consulting 

work is an excellent career 
choice by almost every metric. 
Taking one of those jobs is not 
mutually exclusive with doing 
good in the world. But it’s not 
a job for a recent graduate — 
it’s a job for an old veteran. We 
should think about whether 
some of our best minds are 
being lured away from the 
real 
high-risk, 
high-reward 

work of truly changing the 
world around us by steadier 
salaries and the guarantee of 
prestige. Doing will never be 
as easy a path as consulting, 
and students who have huge 
potential should take this as a 
welcome challenge rather than 
something to shy away from.

Pick doing, not consulting

FROM THE DAILY

Keep Spencer off campus
H

istorically and contemporarily, universities have been 
the center of social change and political discourse. 
Consequently, the nature of free speech on university 

campuses is a deeply important issue. Recently, Richard Spencer, 
a white supremacist and an “alt-right” leader, has asked to speak 
at the University of Michigan. His request prompts a much-needed 
discussion on free speech and how the University will respond to 
it. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board believes that the University 
should fight Richard Spencer’s request to speak on campus for the 
purposes of campus safety.

Muslims on-screen: An 
honest reflection on my 
love for ‘The Big Sick’

The lasting effect of a romantic comedy that gets it (somewhat) right

It feels weird to say, but 

the movie that challenged me 
the most this past year was 
“The Big Sick.” Yes, that one. 
The charming indie romantic 
comedy 
starring 
Kumail 

Nanjiani (“Silicon Valley”) and 
Zoe Kazan (“The Deuce”).

Here, for once, was a positive 

portrayal of Muslims, right? 
They’re not terrorists, at least 
— the lowest possible bar to 
clear for representation for our 

people — and the guy is…dating 
a white woman? That seems 
kind of progressive. I watched it 
and loved it. It was funny in the 
right spots, tender in the others, 
a warm and intimate study of a 
relationship that requires more 
nuance in practice than in its 
idealized conception. And that’s 
not even getting into how good 
Ray Romano (“Get Shorty”) is 
here.

But 
in 
my 
post-film 

discussions 
with 
the 
other 

fellows of my ilk — “brown 
people,” as one might like to 
call them — I was disheartened. 

I rushed to extoll the film’s 
virtues to two of my friends 
(both Muslim, South Asian 
women) only to find them 
disenchanted at best, disgusted 
at worst. I texted my sister 
immediately after, expecting 
wholehearted enthusiasm but 
instead receiving a reply full 
of accusatory disappointment. 
And on a quick phone call with 
my mother, I found that while 
my appreciation for Kumail 
Nanjiani had bloomed, Mrs. 
Chollampat’s greatest fear had 
been actualized on the silver 
screen: That her son (me, for 

those of you keeping score) 
would 
eventually 
marry 
a 

white girl.

This is the worst feeling.
I hate liking something, 

and 
then 
finding 
out 
it’s 

“problematic.” It sucks. You 
feel 
like 
an 
asshole. 
But, 

determined to continue liking 
this movie, I engaged in what 
the kids these days call “civil 
discourse.”

My 
friends’ 
and 
family’s 

main issues with “The Big 
Sick,” it turned out, are ones 
of representation. The South 
Asian women — particularly 
the mother — are portrayed as 
incorrigible, shrew-like, alien; 
Nanjiani’s self-titled character, 
however, is the paragon of the 
assimilated immigrant. Kumail 
is afforded the agency that the 
women of the story, save for 
one brief exchange of dialogue 
with a potential suitor, are not. 
I’d like to counter that this is 
an autobiographical story and 
it’s simply the tale of his life 
that he’s telling, but I can’t. 
That’s too shallow. It’s a valid 
critique and one that I failed to 
acknowledge.

What 
struck 
me 
most, 

however, and what challenged 
me to my core (I know, this 
is just a Sundance romantic 
comedy, can you believe it?), 
was “The Big Sick”’s portrayal 
of Muslims. It’s funny, now that 
I think about it. Remember just, 
like 10 or so years ago, when the 
only work an Arab guy could 
get in Hollywood was some 
dude named Abdul bin-[insert 
“extremely al-Qaeda operative” 
surname here] on “24”? Or this 
classic: We cut to a Middle 
Eastern country (which we 
know is Middle Eastern because, 
duh, the Muslim call to prayer 
is playing in the background!) 
where a guy finishes up on his 
prayer rug before proceeding to 
strap a bomb on his chest and 
blow up a bustling market?

Contrast 
that 
with 
the 

notable 
prayer-rug 
scene 

in “The Big Sick.” Kumail’s 
mother tells him to pray before 
dinner, so he grabs the prayer 

rug, heads downstairs, throws 
on a timer for five minutes and 
sits and watches videos on his 
phone. I’m sorry, Umma, but I 
have literally gone through this 
exact process before.

Where’s the happy medium, 

though? If the two possibilities 
for Muslims onscreen toggle 
between 
deranged 
terrorist 

and guy who fakes prayer 
and drinks at comedy clubs, 
what does that mean for the 
comfortably religious Muslim 
American family?

It’s clear “The Big Sick” 

was sanitized, in some way, 
to appeal to the Sundance 
crowd. Kumail abandons any 
and all semblance of Islam in 

his quest to court (and then 
care for) Emily. His culture of 
arranged marriages and stilted 
family dinners and overbearing 
Muslim 
mothers 
and 
the 

dreaded prospect of a wife with 
an Indian accent is, for the 
most part, portrayed as wholly 
undesirable.

There’s room to grow, then. 

I don’t mean to defame Kumail 
Nanjiani’s relationship with his 
religion; God (I should probably 
say Allah here) only knows 
I’m not a perfect Muslim. But 
it’s clear that Islam isn’t at 
the same level of widespread 
understanding in film as other 
cultures; there’s less room for 
error.

The “lapsed Catholic” is 

a genre unto itself. So, too, 
are Woody Allen’s and Larry 

David’s 
“self-deprecating 

Jew” filmographies. We can’t 
afford to show ourselves to 
the 
American 
audience 
at 

this nebulous space between 
devout 
fundamentalism 
— 

which is inevitably positioned 
as antithetical to the entire 
American experiment — and 
a complete lack of adherence 
to religion. For the average 
moviegoer, Muslims, as they 
are in so many other facets of 
contemporary life, are held 
to a different standard than 
everyone else: they must occupy 
a binary while everyone else is 
afforded the range of spiritual 
possibility. It all, of course, boils 
down to that tiresome cliché of 
assimilation vs. acculturation.

Perhaps there’s no better 

recent example of this abstract 
conflict 
than, 
ironically 

enough, last year’s Democratic 
National 
Convention. 
Khizr 

and Ghazala Khan stood on 
the 
stage 
in 
Philadelphia, 

home of the Liberty Bell and 
the signing of the Declaration 
of 
Independence, 
frantically 

waving the Constitution as 
they lamented the loss of their 
soldier son, killed in Iraq 
and posthumously awarded a 
Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, 
who was finally laid to rest at 
Arlington National Cemetery, 
draped in an American flag. 
And yet, their patriotism was 
questioned.

I still love “The Big Sick.” 

I laugh at Kumail’s snarky 
but loving relationship with 
his mother; I’m moved by 
Zoe 
Kazan’s 
understated 

performance. It’s a romantic 
comedy 
about 
comedians 

starring a brown Muslim guy 
that features an incredible 9/11 
joke — a film seemingly tailor-
made for me. It’s not perfect, I 
know, but for the Aziz Ansari’s 
and the Hasan Minhaj’s and the 
Kumail Nanjiani’s and [insert 
plural characterization of a 
female Muslim comedian who 
will hopefully be just as famous 
very soon] of the world, it’s a 
step in the right direction. I’m 
fine with it.

A look at the problematic portrayal of Judaism on television

Oy Gevalt: How modern 
TV secularizes Judaism

The first time I really felt like I 

saw myself — or rather, my Jewish 
identity — on TV was in the 2003 
Disney Channel Original movie, 
“Full Court Miracle.” The story 
centered 
on 
Alex 
Schlotsky 

(Alex D. Linz, “Max Keeble’s Big 
Move”), the young, precocious 
leader 
of 
an 
inept 
Jewish 

basketball team, who recruits an 
ex-college basketball star to be 
their coach. 

At the time of its release, 

everything about this movie 
screamed modern day Jewish 
culture to me. Alex’s reticence to 
learn Hebrew spoke to my own 
struggle 
with 
understanding 

the intricacies of the language. 
The 
predominantly 
Jewish 

city of Philadelphia, my dad’s 
hometown, felt like a perfect 
backdrop for the story. Jewish 
lingo and rituals were exchanged 

among characters, and above 
everything, the Eight Days of 
Hanukkah made for a clever 
storytelling 
framework. 
And 

in typical Disney fashion, the 
climax of the film saw the mighty 
young Jewish defeating their 
much more imposing opponents, 
mirroring the victory of Judah 
and 
the 
Maccabees 
against 

the Hellenists from the actual 
Hanukkah origin story.

Even though I had seen these 

themes and images explored 
before in other TV movies like 
the 
“Rugrats” 
Passover 
and 

Hanukkah specials, there was 
something 
different 
about 

“Full Court Miracle.” Unlike 
“Rugrats,” “Full Court Miracle” 
wasn’t a simple retelling of 
Jewish oppression in the Bible. 
It captured the spirit of Jewish 
culture by interweaving it into a 
regular, underdog story. Through 
normalizing Judaism, TV helped 
validate my identity. 

Since “Full Court Miracle,” 

television 
has 
continued 

to 
broaden 
and 
unfold 
the 

complexity 
of 
the 
Jewish 

community 
beyond 
religious 

holidays like Hanukkah. Current 
shows like Comedy Central’s 
“Broad 
City” 
and 
Amazon’s 

“Transparent,” 
both 
starring, 

written and created by Jews, each 
have their distinctive depiction of 
Jewish life and culture, but they 
both encapsulate the essence of 
modern day Judaism through the 
mannerisms of their characters.

On “Broad City,” best friends 

Abbi Abrams (Abbi Jacobson, 
“BoJack Horseman”) and Ilana 
Wexler (Ilana Glazer, “The Night 
Before”) engage in their Jewish 
identity in a way that, more or 
less, reflects the current state of 
non-practicing, more culturally 
attuned Jews in America. They 
have difficulty fasting on Yom 
Kippur, attempt to go on a 
Birthright-like trip to Israel and 
face distractions while sitting 
Shiva. Since the show caters 

to such a wide, diverse young 
audience, these moments help 
shift misperceptions of Jews 
in the entertainment industry, 
portraying them as vibrant and 
care-free as every other young 
adult. 

As a much more explicitly 

Jewish alternative to “Broad 
City,” 
“Transparent” 
also 

finds a way to show Jews as 
ordinary members of society 
while recognizing the religious 
aspects 
of 
their 
identities. 

In each of its four seasons, 
“Transparent” explored the rich, 
complicated history behind the 
rich, 
complicated 
Pfefferman 

family. The show’s beginning 
skimmed the surface of modern 
Jewish family life. It introduced 
a rabbi character (Kathryn Hahn, 
“I Love Dick”) and depicted 
scenes of a Shabbat dinner and 
an unsuccessful preparation for 
youngest child Ali’s (Cleo Fraser, 
“Chronic”) Bat Mitzvah. The 
second season expanded on the 
first season’s religious themes, 

tracing 
Maura’s 
transgender 

identity all the way back to her 
aunt Gittel (Hari Nef, “Let Me 
Die a Nun”) in Nazi-controlled 
Europe.

The third and fourth seasons 

took on more current issues 
in 
the 
Jewish 
community, 

covering topics ranging from the 
Israeli/Palestinian 
conflict 
to 

synagogue bureaucracy. Though 
the show occasionally drifts 
into problematic territory — the 
Pfefferman 
matriarch 
Shelly 

(Judith 
Light, 
“Ugly 
Betty”) 

plays into the Jewish mother 
stereotype almost to a fault — 
“Transparent” is a standard 
example of how modern day Jews 
navigate the everyday world, 
confronting the traumas of their 
own history in order to come to 
terms with their present. 

In contrast to the relatively 

accurate 
representations 
of 

Jews 
in 
“Broad 
City” 
and 

“Transparent,” 
other 
Jewish-

themed shows like HBO’s “Curb 
Your Enthusiasm” and Hulu’s 

“Difficult People” — both of 
which are also starring, written 
and created by Jews — have a 
tendency to make Jews seem 
unlikable.

“Curb” creator and star Larry 

David is no stranger to causing 
controversy among the Jewish 
community, given his sardonic, 
neurotic humor and pointed, 
sometimes offensive observations 
on Jewish culture. While his 
most popular work, “Seinfeld,” 
was a huge success and a primary 
catalyst for Jewish representation 
on TV, David reinforces the 
worst possible tropes of Jews 
on “Curb.” He yells at crying 
widows at funerals to shut up, 
chastising unruly children and 
their overbearing parents during 
Passover seders and doodling 
Swastikas in textbooks. Then 
again, 
David 
makes 
fun 
of 

himself throughout the show — a 
character calls him a “self-hating 
Jew,” and David responds, “I do 
hate myself, but it has nothing to 
do with being Jewish.” 

COMEDY CENTRAL

I love female friendship

Hulu’s “Difficult People,” too, 

satirizes some absurd facets of 
Jewish culture. Billy Eichner 
(“American Horror Story: Cult”) 
and 
Julie 
Klausner 
(“Bob’s 

Burgers”) play two struggling 
writers who constantly make fun 
of other people, as well as their 
own Jewish heritage. The two 
venture to Friday night services as 
an excuse to network with Jews in 
the entertainment industry, make 
Adolf Hitler a character in their TV 
pitch to NBC and attempt to avoid 

their stereotypically insufferable 
Jewish families. Similar to “Broad 
City,” “Difficult People” tackles 
various trends in Jewish life and 
the 
increasing 
disillusionment 

toward religious practice among 
Jews today, though arguably to 
a much more provocative and 
exaggerated degree. 

Despite how these four shows 

differ in their views toward 
Judaism, they each incorporate 
an honest depiction of Jewish life. 
In some ways, the stereotypes 

in “Difficult People” and “Curb 
Your Enthusiasm” do illuminate 
some truths about the attitudes 
and beliefs of Jews today, but they 
don’t always get at the root of 
what makes Judaism so complex 
and compelling like in “Broad 
City” and “Transparent.” Part of 
what makes TV so entertaining 
as a medium is being able to not 
only see ourselves portrayed 
on-screen, but also to see the 
subtle nuances of our identities in 
those portrayals.

For the average 

moviegoer, 

Muslims are held 

to a different 
standard than 
everyone else

Now the starter, Peters not short of confidence

Ask Brandon Peters about the 

bruising hit, and he’ll laugh.

It was one he had already 

experienced. As Peters pointed 
out, he once “got folded in half” 
by someone in high school that 
plays at Notre Dame now.

But last Saturday, he got 

another dose of it.

With just under 10 minutes 

remaining in the third quarter 
against 
Minnesota, 
Merrick 

Jackson darted into the backfield 
and 
found 
himself 
one 
on 

one 
with 
Michigan’s 
young 

quarterback.

What happened next may have 

given Wolverine fans some pause. 
Merrick turned Peters into a 
tackling dummy, leaving him on 
the turf, where he was slow to get 
up. According to Peters, he only 
had the wind knocked out of him. 
But the hit was one of the less 
enviable firsts that the redshirt 
freshman has experienced thus 
far in his short tenure.

“It’s probably the first time 

I’ve been hit since high school,” 
Peters said. “Welcome to college 
football.”

Welcome to college football, 

indeed. And the hit aside, it has 
been a peachy start for Peters.

He entered the game against 

Rutgers midway through the 
second quarter, receiving his first 
meaningful college snaps. He 
finished having completed 10 of 
his 14 attempts for 124 yards with 
his first collegiate touchdown 
pass.

A week later, he recorded his 

first start against Minnesota, 
completing 8-of-13 passes for 56 
yards and another touchdown. 
He 
said 
Tuesday 
that 
the 

Wolverines probably could have 
thrown 
more, 
but 
admitted 

there wasn’t much of a need to 
with Michigan’s ground attack 
making his job “10 times easier” 
by rushing for 371 yards and four 
touchdowns.

So instead, as Peters said, he 

simply made sure everyone knew 

what they were doing, knew the 
checks and managed the game. 
And at the end of the day, he 
found solace in his minimalist 
role.

“Obviously we didn’t need the 

pass game much that game,” he 
said. “That’s fine by me, as long 
as we get the win.”

The Wolverines did get the 

win, and a convincing one at that. 
They did so with Peters under 
center against Rutgers, too. And 
the level of competition aside, 
that’s a long way away from 
where he was at the beginning of 
the year.

At Big Ten Media Days in late 

July, Jim Harbaugh said Peters 
was caught in a “dead heat” 
with 
redshirt 
junior 
Wilton 

Speight and fifth-year senior 
John O’Korn, as each vied for the 
starting quarterback position.

But as Michigan moved on 

from spring ball, Peters fell out 
of that competition. When the 
season opener rolled around, he 
was third on the depth chart.

This drop, Peters admits, was 

the product of mental errors. 
As the playbook opened up, 
the issues arose. There were 
turnovers, fumbled snaps and 
missed reads, and he wouldn’t 
call the play right in the huddle.

Through all of it, though, 

Peters didn’t waver in confidence.

“You can’t get down yourself,” 

he said. “You always got to keep 
the same confidence because 
when you start getting down on 
yourself, it’s gonna snowball.”

But nothing snowballed, and 

now Peters is — based on Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
press 
conference 

Monday 
— 
unquestionably 

Michigan’s starting quarterback. 
And if you ask Peters if he 
expected this moment to come 
this season, even he isn’t entirely 
sure.

“At the beginning of the year, 

third string, obviously not many 
third strings get the chance to 
get in the game unless it’s like a 
blowout,” Peters said. “I saw the 
opportunity when Wilton went 
down.

“You never want to wish 

that 
against 
your 
teammate 

for someone to go down, but it 
happens, so you’ve just gotta be 
ready. When that happened, I 
saw an opportunity — second 
string, anything can happen, it’s 
one play away.”

That play — or series of plays 

— finally came in the second 
quarter 
against 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights, when O’Korn went 
three and out with just over 10 
minutes remaining. On the next 
drive, Peters’ two-week path to 
officially being named the starter 
began. 

According to Peters, Speight 

has played a large role along that 
path. 

“He’s been basically like a 

coach,” Peters said. “He’s helped 
me a lot, keeping me confident, 
keeping me calm, giving me tips, 
reminders, that kind of stuff.”

And 
ironically 
enough, 

Speight may be the only one 
left to challenge for Peters’ job. 
After fracturing three vertebrae 

against Purdue and undergoing 
a recovery process, Harbaugh 
said Monday that Speight has 
finally been cleared for non-
contact activity and has resumed 
throwing.

Peters 
knows 
that 
when 

Speight 
does 
finally 
return, 

the competition is open again. 
And he admitted that for this to 
remain his job, he needs to make 
plays, control the offense and 
avoid turnovers.

So far, he has done just that. 

And when asked to grade his own 
understanding of the offense, 
but more specifically, if he could 
do everything Speight could do, 
Peters showed no hesitation.

“Yes sir,” he said. “I got a 

pretty good grasp on the offense. 
There wasn’t much change from 
last year’s offense, a lot of it 
carried over. I’ve been kind of in 
this process for two and a half 
years now when I came early.

“I’ve got a pretty good grasp on 

it. I can do pretty much anything 
the coaches ask me.” 

After unique commitment, Solomon 
enjoying strong freshman campaign

Aubrey Solomon may have 

accidentally said “University 
of 
Miami” 
while 
picking 

up a Michigan cap in his 
commitment 
announcement, 

but nine months later, he has 
become a mainstay in the 
Wolverines’ defensive line. 

Solomon, a true freshman, 

has appeared in every game this 
season and started the last two 
against Rutgers and Minnesota. 
He has 12 tackles so far, and is 
making his presence known.

Michigan 
defensive 
line 

coach Greg Mattison got to 
know Solomon very well as 
a recruit, and ever since the 
Georgia native arrived in Ann 
Arbor last June, Mattison has 
seen him steadily improve.

The 
Wolverines’ 
veterans 

have played a big part in 
Solomon’s progression.

“The 
older 
guys 
really 

mentor him,” Mattison said. 
“You can see it every day. You 
get (redshirt junior guard) 
Bryan Mone coaching him on 
what he should be doing, and 
you’ve got (fifth-year senior) 
Maurice Hurst. The guys will 
be watching the film, and you’ll 
hear them say, ‘That’s really 
good, or, step this way.’ ”

Mattison 
complimented 

Solomon on his work ethic 
and ability to take advice from 
both older players and coaches. 
Mattison, who has coached all 
around the country, made sure 
to involve himself heavily in 
Solomon’s recruitment. After 
all, Solomon was one of the 
nation’s top five players at his 
position.

Solomon, who visited other 

schools like Alabama, Auburn 
and 
Southern 
California, 

decided on Michigan after a 
recruiting saga that lasted for 
half a year.

Solomon 
originally 

committed to Michigan in June 
of 2016, but then decommited a 
few months later after receiving 
a thank-you note from the team 
for a barbecue he never went to. 
Upset by the lack of attention, 
Solomon 
reopened 
his 

recruiting, 
but 

didn’t 
eliminate 

the 
Wolverines 

from contention.

After 
saying 

the 
Crimson 

Tide 
had 
a 

“huge lead” over 
other schools at 
the 
Army 
All-

American 
game 

in 
January 
of 

2017, 
Solomon 

eventually 
recommitted back to Michigan 
— even though he said the wrong 
school in his announcement.

It took a hectic recruiting 

effort 
to 
land 
Solomon 
at 

Michigan, 
and 
though 
the 

defensive lineman may have 

changed his mind once or twice, 
Mattison is confident that the 
now-Wolverine made the right 
choice.

“When 
I 
recruit, 
it’s 
a 

no-brainer for a guy to come 
here,” Mattison said. “ … You’re 

going to have 
a great head 
football coach, 
you’re 
going 

to 
have 
a 

great 
football 

program 
and 

you’re 
going 

to 
have 
an 

opportunity to 
play 
because 

we 
play 
the 

best players.”

Now 
that 

Solomon 
is 
here, 
Mattison 

believes he has taken full 
advantage of the opportunity, 
and when he has gone into 
the 
games, 
he’s 
played 

exceptionally well.

Hurst echoed all the same 

qualities.

“He’s done a really amazing 

job,” Hurst said. “He’s someone 
that works really hard and 
puts in a lot of good work and 
listens to his coaching. … He’s 
a naturally strong, big kid and 
he’s able to do a lot on the field.”

Solomon’s 
role 
on 

the 
defensive 
line 
was 

supplementary up until the last 
few games, but now that he’s 
starting, he has put himself 
among an elite class.

Hurst, sophomore defensive 

end Rashan Gary and redshirt 
junior defensive end Chase 
Winovich have all been key to 
giving the Wolverines the No. 3 
defense in the nation, and now 
Solomon is right up there with 
them.

For Hurst, though, it hasn’t 

been odd to have a true 
freshman 
starting 
alongside 

him. He wasn’t surprised at all 
by Solomon’s progress.

“He’s just a really gifted 

young talent,” Hurst said. “I 
think he’s going to continue to 
get a lot better as time goes on.”

Notebook: Michigan’s 
goaltenders working 
as unit at year’s outset

A year ago, Jack LaFontaine 

and Hayden Lavigne had just 
begun their collegiate careers 
as goaltenders for the Michigan 
hockey team. 

For the sophomores, a lot has 

changed in one year.

Now, after the Ferris State 

series, the two have each started 
four games, have guarded the net 
during an overtime performance 
and have taken on leadership as 
the sixth man despite still being 
underclassmen.

This new experience and 

increased playing time has given 
the netminders an opportunity 
to reflect on their performances 
early on in the season.

“On a personal note, I am 

so far happy, but not overly 
satisfied with my performance,” 
LaFontaine said. “I think there’s 
some tweaks I need to work 
out right now, but I’m working 
towards that on and off the ice. I 
think I haven’t reached my max 
potential, and I’m hoping with a 
little hard work I can meet that.”

Lavigne 
reiterated 
this 

sentiment of a desire to improve, 
naming that he wanted to hone in 
on cadence behind the net.

“These games where we are 

only giving up 25 or (around) 20 
shots, I kind of tend to doze off,” 
Lavigne said. “And that’s one area 
where I need to work on — being 
able to dial it in and eliminate 
those bad timing goals.”

The 
goaltenders 
have 

combined for five wins, and a 
solid goals-against average of 
2.365. Though their amplified 
roles this season add more 
pressure, the two have realized 
the benefits of having a two-man 
rotation, as opposed to three.

“With a two-man rotation, you 

really get to stay in the game,” 
Lavigne said. “You know what it 
feels like from week to week, you 
know what you want to improve 
on from week to week, which 
actually makes it a lot easier.”

Added LaFontaine: “Having 

a two-man rotation is a little bit 
easier. You can catch more of a 
groove physically.”

Eight games in, Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson is looking 
to have a go-to man set in goal. 
This starter may even emerge in 
the Wolverines’ upcoming series, 
which would result in a change to 
this rotation.

“We’ve had a pretty good 

sample size of where they are 
at,” Pearson said. “They’ve both 
played well, so at this point you’re 
not going to bury one guy. At 
the same time, if one guy gets 
hot, then he’s going to have the 
opportunity to play consecutive 
games.”

With this in mind, LaFontaine 

and Lavigne still view themselves 
as a unit that works in cohesion.

“I wouldn’t say it’s much of a 

competition, as much as we are a 
team,” LaFontaine said.

Hughes Shows Skills on 

Both Ends

The youngest player in NCAA 

Division I hockey has already 

started making his mark on the 
Michigan team.

Freshman 
defenseman 

Quinn Hughes had a breakout 
performance in Thursday night’s 
Ferris State rout, which Pearson 
deemed 
the 
blueliner’s 
best 

performance thus far this season.

“He 
doesn’t 
surprise 
me 

anymore. That was his best 
game,” Pearson said after the 
game. “When he’s on the ice, I tell 
people you’d pay to watch him. 
You really would. He’s a special 
player.”

In the game, Hughes got off 

a shot in the first period and 
three in the second — the most 
launched by a defenseman in 
the outing. In addition to his 
offensive contributions, Hughes 
stood his ground in the defensive 
zone.

“He didn’t have any blatant 

turnovers (Thursday),” Pearson 
said. “He seemed to be on the 
right side of the puck, he picked 
his places where he could jump in 
and try some things offensively.

“I thought he was real good. 

I thought in both games (of the 
series) he was pretty good, but 
Thursday stood out to me.”

The expertise of balancing 

offensive 
playmaking 
with 

staying back on defense did not 
come automatically for Hughes.

In earlier games, Pearson 

noted 
that 
the 
freshman 

struggled more with turning the 
puck over and getting trapped 
when 
attempting 
to 
shine 

offensively.

But following the weekend, 

Pearson 
believes 
that 
these 

kinks have been ironed out, and 
that Hughes now knows how to 
choose his offensive spots wisely. 
 

“He was trying to do a few too 

many things offensively, and put 
himself in sort of a bad position 
defensively,” Pearson said. “And 
I think he’s really grown and 
learned from that over the course 
of the last few weeks.”

Injury Update
Michigan’s already relatively 

small array of defensemen will 
continue to be a man down — at 
least for another week. 

Senior Cutler Martin, one of 

the Wolverines’ most veteran 
defensemen, will likely be out 
of the lineup until after the 
Wisconsin series due to injury.

“He’s got an upper body injury, 

it’s sort of week to week right 
now,” Pearson said.

Martin got hurt during his first 

shift against Penn State on Oct. 
28 while he was playing forward, 
and has been out ever since. 

“He went to hit a guy and 

fell awkward into the boards,” 
Pearson said. “… Obviously he 
likes to play the physical game, 
and he doesn’t mind getting 
involved physically.” 

As 
a 
multifaceted 
player, 

Martin adds depth to Michigan’s 
roster on both sides of the ice. But 
when he returns to full health in 
a few weeks, he is expected to 
come back on defense due to the 
shortage of defensemen available 
on the Wolverines’ line.

Added Pearson: “It will be 

good to get him back.”

Intersections of art and religion can be seen across campus and students

“I find the best places that 

I can focus, and that I can 
worship, are places that have 
art or have artistic qualities. I 
don’t pray well in a little white 
box in a reflection room because 
it’s not really soothing.”

For Public Health student 

Nuha 
Mahmood, 
art 
and 

religion are intertwined. The 
addition of art in places of 
worship amplifies her prayer. 

“I’ll be really focused and 

really into it if I’m at the 
mosque that has calligraphy or 
art on the walls,” she said. 

It’s a sentiment that spans 

across continents; the interior 
of oldest mosque in the world, 
the Masjid al-Haram (or the 
Great Mosque of Mecca), has a 
forest of white pillars, gleaming 
marble arms that stretch up 
endlessly, crowned by stretches 
of calligraphy. The lines are 
graceful and exact, and their 
curves match the curved backs 

of the people as they bend down 
to pray. Their worship and the 
detail of the surrounding art 
reveal similar narratives: a 
story of dedication and devoted 
care. 

Across all faiths, religion 

and art have the potential to 
be easily connected. There 
already 
exists 
a 
sprawling 

history behind the portrayal 
of religion in art: paintings 

hung in the Vatican serving 
as the visual icons to religious 
stories and verses of the Qur’an 
turning melodic in recitation; 
on Lantau Island in Hong 
Kong, Tian Tan Buddha blots 
out parts of the sky; in Rio de 

Janeiro, Christ the Redeemer’s 
outstretched arms take flight 
30 meters above Brazil. 

Throughout the years, people 

have consistently turned to art 
as a platform for displaying 
religion. 

More 
expressive 
than 

written 
text, 
art 
makes 

religion more personable. It 
is, at times, a window into the 
interpretation of the artist — 
an invitation that is accessible 
to all. The method in which 
Diego Velázquez chose to paint 
Christ Crucified, a solemn 
figure with head lowered and 
eyes closed, induces a state of 
quiet contemplation no matter 
the religious affiliation (or lack 
thereof) of the viewer. 

The relationship between 

faith and art, however, is not 
solely limited to oil paintings 
and 
frescoes. 
Even 
more 

contemporary 
aspects 
of 

artistic 
performance 
that 

seem 
to 
stand 
completely 

independent of religion can 
share common themes. 

Both art and religion can

‘I was raised in the church’ 
reconciling faith and craft

take time to develop. Both art 
and religion can be used as 
forms of self-expression.

Music, Theatre, and Dance 

senior 
Grace 
Bydalek 
has 

always 
considered 
musical 

theatre a large part of her life. 

“I was probably six or seven 

when I started,” she said. “I 
started with A Christmas Carol. 
And then I kinda got bit by that 
bug and never went back.” 

Paralleling her art is her 

religion — an aspect of her life 
that has been as long-lasting as 
the musical theatre component.

“I was raised in the church,” 

she said. “so I was raised 
Presbyterian and Protestant. 
So I went to church all growing 
up with my family, it was a big 
family thing. We would go on 
Sundays and Wednesdays and 
do the whole conformation 
thing and do the whole Sunday 

school and bible school and 

vacation bible school and the 
whole thing.”

Music, Theatre, and Dance 

student Vincent Ford shared a 
similar story. 

“I’ve been working in the 

industry professionally since I 
was like six or seven,” he said. 
“I started off doing vocal work 
and a little modeling work and 
then, as I got older, I went over 
to the world of film and then I 
became heavy in theatre.”

Like 
Bydalek, 
Ford 
was 

raised in a religious household, 
spending time in church with 
his family as well as under the 
spotlight on stage or in front of 
the camera. 

“I’m a very southern man, 

so I was raised up extremely, 
strictly Christian,” For said. “I 
grew up in a Baptist religion. I 
come from a family of ministers 
and clergymen so I know what 
it is to be caught in religion.”

The 
commonality

lasting as the

component

More expressive 
than written text, 
art makes religion 
more personable

these distinct identities of art 
and religion is community — a 
concept Mahmood discussed 
when detailing her experience 
as a member of her high school’s 
Indian Students Association. 
Every year, Mahmood and the 
rest of the organization would 
put on a multicultural show, 
and, during her last two years 
of 
high 
school, 
Mahmood 

found herself filling the role of 
choreographer. However, more 
valuable than the actual dances 
themselves was the resulting 
interconnectedness throughout 
the group as a whole. 

“Just the skill of building 

community 
and 
building 
a 

pseudo-family for a lot of these 
kids that wouldn’t have found 
comfort anywhere else,” she 
said. “So, you get a lot of the 
people who tend to be loners, 
I felt like. They came and they 
would find people to support 
them there.”

A home built out of shared 

interests 
and 
countless 

rehearsals — the unity that 
Mahmood discovered within 
her cultural association is a 
concept holds true for Bydalek 

and Ford, as well. 

However, 
within 
religion 

and art, alongside cohesion, 
there can also exist conflict.

“This 
past 
year,” 
Ford 

explained, “I was in show 
called “Insurrection Holding 
History…” and my character 
was 
a 
slave 
who 
had 
a 

homosexual love interest… I 
remember telling my parents 
about it… [my father] wouldn’t 
come to the show because it’s 
just that far removed from our 
religious beliefs.” 

Contrasting 
his 
father’s 

actions, Ford approached this 
role with an open mind.

“The most important part 

about most religions is that 
we just are our best selves as 
human beings and that we love 
everyone equally,” Ford said. 
“I told the whole cast and the 
director as well that I grew 
as a person because of this 
production, because I was able 
to see the light of God through 
everyone.” 

Bydalek 
reconciles 
the 

occasional tension between her 
religion and her passion in a 
slightly different way. 

“I think of all the characters 

I’ve played as having important 
stories,” she explained. “Stories 
that were written for a reason. 
Stories that need to be told for 
a reason… it’s not necessarily 
about me, it’s more about telling 
a story.” 

And the stories that Bydalek, 

Ford and Mahmood share as 
they continue to balance art and 
religion have the capacity to 
inspire others; the interactions 
between 
art 
and 
religion 

prompt understanding: Ford’s 
dad might have purposefully 
skipped “Insurrection Holding 
History,” 
but 
Ford’s 
mom 

came, watched and had a 
life-changing 
experience. 

In religion, there is always a 
capacity for growth.

There 
is 
also 
always 
a 

capacity for art. 

Mahmood’s 
roommate 
is 

currently a member of the 
organization, “Redefine.” She 
pushes to re-introduce the 
component of art in religion; 
the significance it places on 
the synergy between art and 
religion is far-reaching.

I keep promising myself I’m 

never going to start another 
piece with “Senior year of high 
school …” again, but, alas, here 
we are. What can I say? It was 
formative.

Senior year of high school, 

during my wild, wild Spring 
Break, I got a nasal septoplasty 
— not a nose job, but basically 
a nose job. I broke my nose in 
2012, and for various reasons 
(mostly my fear of pain and, 
ironically, 
painkillers), 
I 

decided to be a mouth-breather 
for four years before getting it 
fixed. The week following the 
surgery, my doctor put me on 
a lot of Vicodin. I mean, a lot. 
I ended up spending my days 
with 
milkshakes, 
watching 

“Sing it On” (a docuseries 
on 
collegiate 
a 
cappella) 

and 
carefully 
blotting 
the 

tragedy that was my face. 
The experience birthed this

niche 
love 
for 
a

I was presented with the 
opportunity to speak with two 
of the University of Michigan’s 
groups, I couldn’t help but be 
reminded of how charming the 
art form is.

ASTHMATIC KITTY

Sufjan Stevens is a srange, beautiful man
The compelling faith of 
musician Sufjan Stevens

How the artist managed to deliver religion to those who reject it

Sufjan Stevens has never hid 

his faith. Throughout his work, 
he borrows extensively from 
Christian imagery. I always had 
viewed his frequent religious 
allusions as just another one 
of his characteristic oddities, 
akin to his absurd song titles 
and state-themed albums. It’s 
not as though Christianity 
is 
universally 
present 
in 

his works: Sure, if you only 
listened to Seven Swans, you 
might assume Sufjan to be an 
aspiring member of the clergy, 
but if you had only heard The 
Age of Adz you would never 
know he was religious at all. 
However, my views changed 
when I read his blog post that 
compared artistic creation to 
the Christian concept of the 
Eucharist — Sufjan views the 
artist as transforming their 
spirit into a tangible creation 
as an act of generosity. His 
blog made me realize that 
Sufjan’s 
views 
on 
religion 

were 
much 
more 
complex 

and idiosyncratic than I had 
initially viewed them.

I, being irreligious, have 

never had a positive impression 
of “Christian music,” always 
viewing it as exclusive or 
pandering. 
Stevens 
inverts 

those 
stereotypes. 
His 

religious 
inclinations 
feel 

wholly genuine and inclusive, 
a reflection of his personal 
experience without artifice. 
It 
is 
what 
separates 
him 

from the music labelled as 
“Christian,” that he himself 
described in a 2006 interview 
with Delucions of Adequacy 
as 
existing 
“exclusively 

within 
the 
few 
insulated 

floors (cubicles and computers 
included) of some corporate 
construction 
in 
Nashville, 

Tenn.” Rather than being stiff 
and preachy, Sufjan’s faith is 
malleable and subjective; it is 
open for interpretation. The 
way that Sufjan incorporates 

Christianity into his work 
proves that artists don’t have to 
label themselves as “Christian 
music” or beat the listener 
over the head with a neon bible 
to do so. His hymns are not 
agents of proselytization or 
ecclesiastical drones, but the 
earnest products of an attempt 
to 
create 
beauty 
through 

expression.

Sufjan’s 
most 
overtly 

religious 
work 
is 
Seven 

Swans, 
an 
acoustic-folk 

album he released in 2005. 
The album is littered with 
Christian 
allusions 
and 

spiritual overtones, including 
two songs (“Abraham” and 
“The Transfiguration”) that 
are actual Biblical tales. Yet, 
Sufjan made his position clear 

with DOA: “I don’t make faith-
based music,” he said. This 
is a confusing statement at 
first — this guy just made a 
song consisting of the story of 
the Transfiguration of Christ 
with a banjo playing in the 
background, 
and 
now 
he’s 

saying that he doesn’t make 
faith-based music? The key 
word here is “based”: while 
Sufjan 
often 
infuses 
faith 

into his music, his religion is 
never the basis of his creation. 
In that same interview, he 
provides further clarification: 
“It’s not so much that faith 
influences us as it lives in us. 

In every circumstance (giving 
a speech or tying my shoes), 
I am living and moving and 
being. This absolves me from 
ever making the embarrassing 
effort to gratify God (and the 
church) by imposing religious 
content on anything I do,” he 
said. To view certain songs 
as “Christian music” implies 
that there is some distinction 
between the religion of the 
artist and the rest of their 
existence.

Part of what makes Sufjan’s 

faith compelling is that he isn’t 
afraid to publicly wrestle with 
it — in the elegiac “Casimir 
Pulaski Day,” Sufjan tells the 
story of a female friend who 
was 
diagnosed 
with 
bone 

cancer. “Tuesday night at the 
Bible study, we lift our hands 
and pray over your body but 
nothing ever happens,” he 
sings. The creeping doubt, 
the “nothing ever happens,” 
is the subtle thread that runs 
through the narrative of the 
track. In the final line, after 
Sufjan’s friend passes away, 
the religious conflict comes 
to the forefront: “All the glory 
when He took our place, but 
He took my shoulders and He 
shook my face, and He takes 
and He takes and He takes.” 
Sufjan offers questions but 
no answers — his doubt is not 
assuaged, and he is just left 
with his confusion: he doesn’t 
understand why the glorious 
God who sacrificed his son in 
the place of humanity continues 
to take with no recompense. 
There is no answer. The song 
is over. Sufjan isn’t the type 
to conclude with a moralizing 
statement, or some life lesson. 
He tells his story, and he tells 
it as well as he can. This lack of 
an ulterior motive, be it piety 
or proselytization, is what 
sets Sufjan apart from other 
Christian musicians. In the 
DOA interview, he concurs: 
“On an aesthetic level, faith 
and art are a dangerous match. 
Today, they can quickly lead to 
devotional artifice or didactic

So strange, so beautiful he even has wings

crap. This would summarize 
the 
Christian 
publishing 

world or the Christian music 
industry.”

Another point of curiosity 

in 
Sufjan’s 
music 
is 
the 

relationship 
between 
his 

Christian 
beliefs 
and 
his 

slightly-less-than-ambiguous 
sexuality, with songs such as 
“Futile Devices,” “The Owl 
and the Tanager” and “All for 
Myself” all depicting a love 
interest of Sufjan’s as male. In 
both “To Be Alone With You” 
and “John My Beloved,” the 
narrator addresses a “you” in 
an intimate manner who can 
be interpreted as either Jesus 
or a male lover. While many 
Christians would view these 
two identities as conflicting, 
Sufjan seems to be asserting 
that they can coexist. The 
only hint he gives of conflict 
between his faith and the 
homosexual 
undertones 
in 

his music can be found in 
the 
song 
“The 
Predatory 

Wasp of the Palisades Is Out 
to Get Us!” in which Sufjan 
narrates 
an 
experience 
he 

had at a Methodist summer 
camp: The lyrics imply an 
intimate love between Sufjan 

and his male friend, with 
an ominous wasp hovering 
overhead as Sufjan’s feelings 
progress. This ominous wasp 
can be interpreted as Sufjan’s 
reservations about this same-
sex 
attraction 
brought 
on 

by his religious upbringing, 
a 
disquieting 
presence 

threatening its harsh sting.

Also worth mentioning are 

the two Christmas albums. A 
seamless mixture of the sacred 
and the secular; the 52-track 
long Silver & Gold contains 
both a faithful rendition of 
“Break Forth O Beauteous 

Heavenly Light” and a twelve 
minute long original work 
entitled “Christmas Unicorn” 
that itself includes a lengthy 
interpolation of Joy Division. 
Somehow, these two songs feel 
as though they belong together, 
united 
by 
Sufjan’s 
earnest 

nature and vision of beauty 
in spite of their ostensibly 
different tones.

Sufjan’s Christianity, in its 

honesty and unashamed doubt, 
succeeds in doing what the 
best efforts of the neon Bible-
thumpers in Nashville could 
not — providing a wholesome 
form of music that discusses 
faith 
while 
still 
appealing 

to non-believers. Of course, 
Sufjan was only able to achieve 
this because he is not trying to. 
“Christian music,” as a genre, 
will always feel duplicitous to 
nonbelievers — they know that 
they are trying to be convinced 
of something; the whole genre 
is a tool of conversion (a clumsy 
one, at that) rather than art. 
Sufjan, in total contrast, only 
includes faith when it adds to 
the final artistic product; it is 
never the goal, only the means. 
Sufjan is not a Christian artist. 
He is an artist who is Christian.

I, being 

irreligious, 
have never 

had a positive 
impression of 

“Christian music”

that, I feel overjoyed and 

accomplished.”

Citing Peggy James’s “Bring 

in Your Glory,” as her favorite 
song 
to 
perform, 
Hamilton 

spoke to the value of tradition 
within the Chorale:

“This is a song that has been 

sung each year, and every MGC 
member, past and present, has 
known or will know this song. It 

is one that brings us all together 
as one big family.”

Exuding nothing but warmth, 

MGC 
is 
effervescent 
and 

inspired and filled to the brim 
with pure, unfettered joy. A 
loving bunch, its members are 
bound together by their shared 
convictions and a collective 
goal. KHK, albeit stemming 
from another religion, is no 
different in this regard.

“No matter the level of 

observance, Judaism is another 
aspect of our group, in addition 
to us all loving music and 

singing, that we all have in 
common,” Bruder wrote. “Of 
course, UofM has a prevalent 
Jewish population, and KHK is 
one niche-group that can make 
Michigan’s Jewish community 
even smaller for people who 
want to become involved but 
don’t know where to start.”

Integrating its members own 

personalities into its collective 
range, KHK sings American pop 
songs, in addition to Hebrew 
and Jewish pop songs.

“Right now, our repertoire 

includes some Idan Raichel (a

popular Israeli artist) songs, 
as well as ‘Drop the Game’ by 
Flume and Chet Faker, ‘Sunday 
Candy’ by Chance the Rapper, 
and ‘Electric Love’ by Børns,” 
Bruder wrote. “I love that each 
semester is different in terms of 
songs we learn, and the positive 
messages in all of them reflect 
who we are as a group.”

KHK 
is 
a 
multifaceted 

team, including students in 
engineering; pre-law; the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance; pre-
med; and pre-social work.

“Each semester brings in 

new members with completely 
different backgrounds, and I 
have enjoyed becoming best 
friends with a group of people 
who have various passions but 
can come together to make 
good music,” Bruder wrote. “I 
have always loved a cappella, 

even before ‘Pitch Perfect,’ 
and knowing I have a space 
on campus for a performance 
outlet has made my Michigan 
experience so much better.”

Both groups have regular 

shows, the next one being in 
December for KHK. It will also 
be performing this February at 
the game between the Detroit 
Pistons 
and 
the 
Portland 

Trailblazers. 
MGC 
regularly 

holds a benefit concert, a fall 
concert and a spring concert, 
all free of charge. Its chief event 
each year is a Spring Break 
tour, during which its members 
minister at various churches

I think a lot of what I found 

charming about collegiate a 
cappella — back in those ill-
fated, Vicodin-hazed days of 
senior year — was that everyone 

involved had an incredible trust

their principles, MGC and KHK 
comprise individuals who have 
faith — faith in their religions, 
faith in their talents and faith in 
one another.

This movie is glaring with plot holes including: the main 

character is not Christian, the male love interest strongly 
resembles a Neo-Nazi, the Christian family dines over choco-
late chip cookies and lemonade, the female lead chose a picture 
of herself in a CHUNKY HEADBAND as her profile picture 
for her I have to say though they did a great job incorporating

FILM NOTEBOOK

Last week I lit a yahrzeit 

(remembrance) 
candle, 

exactly two years after my 
grandmother’s 
death. 
In 

Jewish tradition, one lights 
a 
candle 
every 
year 
on 

the anniversary of a loved 
one’s passing. The candle is 
supposed to symbolize life’s 
fleeting nature and represent 
the soul’s journey upwards. It 
got me thinking about the other 
mourning rituals in Judaism; 
Ranging from the preciseness 
with which the body is cleaned 
to the strange tradition of 
covering the mirrors while 
sitting Shiva. These rituals, 
while they may seem odd, are 
essential in the process of 
grieving. In search of a deeper 
understanding of my religion’s 
view of death, I turned to 
film. I uncovered several films 
that explicitly depict Jewish 
mourning rituals, from sitting 
Shiva in “This is Where I Leave 
You,” to Jewish burial in “Son 
of Saul,” to the mourner’s 
Kaddish in films like “The Jazz 
Singer,” “Schindler’s List” and 
even “Rocky.”

Based on the book of the 

same name, “This is Where 
I Leave You,” follows the 
Altman family, four siblings 
who have grown apart through 
adulthood and encountering 
real-life struggles of their own. 
Following their father’s death, 
their mother (Jane Fonda, 
“Grace and Frankie”) forces 
them to live under the same 
roof of their childhood home 

for the week of Shiva. Starring 
the likes of Jason Bateman 
(“Horrible Bosses”), Tina Fey 
(“Whiskey Tango Foxtrot”), 
Adam Driver (“Paterson”) and 
Corey Stoll (“Ant-Man”) as the 
Altman siblings, this dramedy 
is centered on the Jewish ritual 
of sitting Shiva. Sitting Shiva is 
a tradition following the death 
of a close relative in which the 
family sits, literally, on low 
stools or chairs for a week. In 
this week, the family remains 
in 
one 
location, 
accepts 

condolence calls and casseroles 
and tell stories and memories 
about the dearly departed. 
“This is Where I Leave You” 
teeters a fine line between 
comedy and drama, basically 
mirroring the complex feelings 
of togetherness and loss that 
Shiva accomplishes.

The Hungarian Holocaust 

film “Son of Saul” (László 
Nemes) 
won 
the 
Academy 

Award 
for 
Best 
Foreign 

Language 
Film 
in 
2016. 

The film follows Saul (Géza 
Röhrig), 
a 
prisoner 
in 

Auschwitz whose job is to strip 
and burn the bodies of the 
murdered Jewish prisoners. 
Saul discovers the body of a 
boy he calls his son and swears 
to give him a proper Jewish 
burial from a Rabbi. The 
terrifying and beautiful film 
paints a harrowing portrait of 
the human capacity for tragedy 
and a father’s love. In the 
concentration camps, life was 
an everyday battle and death 
was all around. Death was 
imminent and unavoidable, yet 
for the sonderkommandos like 
Saul, death was a day job. The 

act of purifying the darkness 
of death is a core belief in 
Judaism, that the dead remain 
dignified, cleaned and clothed 
before they are buried. For the 
Jews in the Holocaust, there 
was as little humanity in life as 
there was in death.

The 
mourner’s 
Kaddish 

is a special prayer recited by 
the family members of the 
deceased for the year following 
their death. The prayer is 
supposed to assist the mourner 
in the mourning process, a 
mode of reflection and a public 
pronouncement of one’s grief. 
Its somber notes are a universal 
sign of loss. For example, Rocky 
Balboa recites the Kaddish for 
Mickey in “Rocky III.” Cantor 
Rabinovitch (Laurence Olivier) 
in “The Jazz Singer” says the 
Kaddish as he disowns his son, 
evoking a dramatic sense of loss. 
In the last scene at the factory in 
Steven Spielberg’s “Schindler’s 
List,” Schindler declares three 
minutes of silence for the 
fallen. As he crosses his chest, 
a voice screams from the crowd 
the mourner’s Kaddish.

Jewish mourning rituals are 

unique in the fact that they 
are built on togetherness. One 
cannot sit Shiva without family 
or friends, the body before 
burial must be watched by a 
group of individuals and the 
mourner’s Kaddish cannot be 
said without the presence of 
a minyan (quorum). Grieving 
a loved one is a wound that 
never truly heals, therefore, 
we should support one another 
in times of suffering. No one 
should go through the pain of 
loss alone.

we see “The Passion of the Christ.” I, unfortunately, 

can’t adequately communicate how I’m not exactly 

in the mood to watch a bleeding Jim Caviezel for 

three hours. Alas.

Baked walks in and Buzzed emphatically 

implores Baked to watch “The Passion of the

mention it’s three hours long. Baked no lon-
ger seems amused. Alas.

After spending some time searching for 

notably terrible spiritual dramas on Netf-
lix (and watching twenty minutes of other 
drivel in the process), it’s as if some unex-
plainable divine force intervened in our 
lives as Netflix suggested we watch “Chris-
tian Mingle The Movie.” Masochism is alive 
and well in my social circle. Alas.

Save for the absurd plot holes (why a non-

Christian would immediately choose Chris-

tian Mingle to find love over the fucking obvious 

choice of any other dating site that exists is beyond 

me), the crippling stupidity that plagues the film’s 

entire cast and dialogue stale enough to belong in sub-

been worse. At least I didn’t spend three hours watching

Muslims on-screen: An 
honest reflection on my 
love for ‘The Big Sick’

The lasting effect of a romantic comedy that gets it (somewhat) right

It feels weird to say, but 

the movie that challenged me 
the most this past year was 
“The Big Sick.” Yes, that one. 
The charming indie romantic 
comedy 
starring 
Kumail 

Nanjiani (“Silicon Valley”) and 
Zoe Kazan (“The Deuce”).

Here, for once, was a positive 

portrayal of Muslims, right? 
They’re not terrorists, at least 
— the lowest possible bar to 
clear for representation for our 

people — and the guy is…dating 
a white woman? That seems 
kind of progressive. I watched it 
and loved it. It was funny in the 
right spots, tender in the others, 
a warm and intimate study of a 
relationship that requires more 
nuance in practice than in its 
idealized conception. And that’s 
not even getting into how good 
Ray Romano (“Get Shorty”) is 
here.

But 
in 
my 
post-film 

discussions 
with 
the 
other 

fellows of my ilk — “brown 
people,” as one might like to 
call them — I was disheartened. 

I rushed to extoll the film’s 
virtues to two of my friends 
(both Muslim, South Asian 
women) only to find them 
disenchanted at best, disgusted 
at worst. I texted my sister 
immediately after, expecting 
wholehearted enthusiasm but 
instead receiving a reply full 
of accusatory disappointment. 
And on a quick phone call with 
my mother, I found that while 
my appreciation for Kumail 
Nanjiani had bloomed, Mrs. 
Chollampat’s greatest fear had 
been actualized on the silver 
screen: That her son (me, for 

those of you keeping score) 
would 
eventually 
marry 
a 

white girl.

This is the worst feeling.
I hate liking something, 

and 
then 
finding 
out 
it’s 

“problematic.” It sucks. You 
feel 
like 
an 
asshole. 
But, 

determined to continue liking 
this movie, I engaged in what 
the kids these days call “civil 
discourse.”

My 
friends’ 
and 
family’s 

main issues with “The Big 
Sick,” it turned out, are ones 
of representation. The South 
Asian women — particularly 
the mother — are portrayed as 
incorrigible, shrew-like, alien; 
Nanjiani’s self-titled character, 
however, is the paragon of the 
assimilated immigrant. Kumail 
is afforded the agency that the 
women of the story, save for 
one brief exchange of dialogue 
with a potential suitor, are not. 
I’d like to counter that this is 
an autobiographical story and 
it’s simply the tale of his life 
that he’s telling, but I can’t. 
That’s too shallow. It’s a valid 
critique and one that I failed to 
acknowledge.

What 
struck 
me 
most, 

however, and what challenged 
me to my core (I know, this 
is just a Sundance romantic 
comedy, can you believe it?), 
was “The Big Sick”’s portrayal 
of Muslims. It’s funny, now that 
I think about it. Remember just, 
like 10 or so years ago, when the 
only work an Arab guy could 
get in Hollywood was some 
dude named Abdul bin-[insert 
“extremely al-Qaeda operative” 
surname here] on “24”? Or this 
classic: We cut to a Middle 
Eastern country (which we 
know is Middle Eastern because, 
duh, the Muslim call to prayer 
is playing in the background!) 
where a guy finishes up on his 
prayer rug before proceeding to 
strap a bomb on his chest and 
blow up a bustling market?

Contrast 
that 
with 
the 

notable 
prayer-rug 
scene 

in “The Big Sick.” Kumail’s 
mother tells him to pray before 
dinner, so he grabs the prayer 

rug, heads downstairs, throws 
on a timer for five minutes and 
sits and watches videos on his 
phone. I’m sorry, Umma, but I 
have literally gone through this 
exact process before.

Where’s the happy medium, 

though? If the two possibilities 
for Muslims onscreen toggle 
between 
deranged 
terrorist 

and guy who fakes prayer 
and drinks at comedy clubs, 
what does that mean for the 
comfortably religious Muslim 
American family?

It’s clear “The Big Sick” 

was sanitized, in some way, 
to appeal to the Sundance 
crowd. Kumail abandons any 
and all semblance of Islam in 

his quest to court (and then 
care for) Emily. His culture of 
arranged marriages and stilted 
family dinners and overbearing 
Muslim 
mothers 
and 
the 

dreaded prospect of a wife with 
an Indian accent is, for the 
most part, portrayed as wholly 
undesirable.

There’s room to grow, then. 

I don’t mean to defame Kumail 
Nanjiani’s relationship with his 
religion; God (I should probably 
say Allah here) only knows 
I’m not a perfect Muslim. But 
it’s clear that Islam isn’t at 
the same level of widespread 
understanding in film as other 
cultures; there’s less room for 
error.

The “lapsed Catholic” is 

a genre unto itself. So, too, 
are Woody Allen’s and Larry 

David’s 
“self-deprecating 

Jew” filmographies. We can’t 
afford to show ourselves to 
the 
American 
audience 
at 

this nebulous space between 
devout 
fundamentalism 
— 

which is inevitably positioned 
as antithetical to the entire 
American experiment — and 
a complete lack of adherence 
to religion. For the average 
moviegoer, Muslims, as they 
are in so many other facets of 
contemporary life, are held 
to a different standard than 
everyone else: they must occupy 
a binary while everyone else is 
afforded the range of spiritual 
possibility. It all, of course, boils 
down to that tiresome cliché of 
assimilation vs. acculturation.

Perhaps there’s no better 

recent example of this abstract 
conflict 
than, 
ironically 

enough, last year’s Democratic 
National 
Convention. 
Khizr 

and Ghazala Khan stood on 
the 
stage 
in 
Philadelphia, 

home of the Liberty Bell and 
the signing of the Declaration 
of 
Independence, 
frantically 

waving the Constitution as 
they lamented the loss of their 
soldier son, killed in Iraq 
and posthumously awarded a 
Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, 
who was finally laid to rest at 
Arlington National Cemetery, 
draped in an American flag. 
And yet, their patriotism was 
questioned.

I still love “The Big Sick.” 

I laugh at Kumail’s snarky 
but loving relationship with 
his mother; I’m moved by 
Zoe 
Kazan’s 
understated 

performance. It’s a romantic 
comedy 
about 
comedians 

starring a brown Muslim guy 
that features an incredible 9/11 
joke — a film seemingly tailor-
made for me. It’s not perfect, I 
know, but for the Aziz Ansari’s 
and the Hasan Minhaj’s and the 
Kumail Nanjiani’s and [insert 
plural characterization of a 
female Muslim comedian who 
will hopefully be just as famous 
very soon] of the world, it’s a 
step in the right direction. I’m 
fine with it.

A look at the problematic portrayal of Judaism on television

Oy Gevalt: How modern 
TV secularizes Judaism

The first time I really felt like I 

saw myself — or rather, my Jewish 
identity — on TV was in the 2003 
Disney Channel Original movie, 
“Full Court Miracle.” The story 
centered 
on 
Alex 
Schlotsky 

(Alex D. Linz, “Max Keeble’s Big 
Move”), the young, precocious 
leader 
of 
an 
inept 
Jewish 

basketball team, who recruits an 
ex-college basketball star to be 
their coach. 

At the time of its release, 

everything about this movie 
screamed modern day Jewish 
culture to me. Alex’s reticence to 
learn Hebrew spoke to my own 
struggle 
with 
understanding 

the intricacies of the language. 
The 
predominantly 
Jewish 

city of Philadelphia, my dad’s 
hometown, felt like a perfect 
backdrop for the story. Jewish 
lingo and rituals were exchanged 

among characters, and above 
everything, the Eight Days of 
Hanukkah made for a clever 
storytelling 
framework. 
And 

in typical Disney fashion, the 
climax of the film saw the mighty 
young Jewish defeating their 
much more imposing opponents, 
mirroring the victory of Judah 
and 
the 
Maccabees 
against 

the Hellenists from the actual 
Hanukkah origin story.

Even though I had seen these 

themes and images explored 
before in other TV movies like 
the 
“Rugrats” 
Passover 
and 

Hanukkah specials, there was 
something 
different 
about 

“Full Court Miracle.” Unlike 
“Rugrats,” “Full Court Miracle” 
wasn’t a simple retelling of 
Jewish oppression in the Bible. 
It captured the spirit of Jewish 
culture by interweaving it into a 
regular, underdog story. Through 
normalizing Judaism, TV helped 
validate my identity. 

Since “Full Court Miracle,” 

television 
has 
continued 

to 
broaden 
and 
unfold 
the 

complexity 
of 
the 
Jewish 

community 
beyond 
religious 

holidays like Hanukkah. Current 
shows like Comedy Central’s 
“Broad 
City” 
and 
Amazon’s 

“Transparent,” 
both 
starring, 

written and created by Jews, each 
have their distinctive depiction of 
Jewish life and culture, but they 
both encapsulate the essence of 
modern day Judaism through the 
mannerisms of their characters.

On “Broad City,” best friends 

Abbi Abrams (Abbi Jacobson, 
“BoJack Horseman”) and Ilana 
Wexler (Ilana Glazer, “The Night 
Before”) engage in their Jewish 
identity in a way that, more or 
less, reflects the current state of 
non-practicing, more culturally 
attuned Jews in America. They 
have difficulty fasting on Yom 
Kippur, attempt to go on a 
Birthright-like trip to Israel and 
face distractions while sitting 
Shiva. Since the show caters 

to such a wide, diverse young 
audience, these moments help 
shift misperceptions of Jews 
in the entertainment industry, 
portraying them as vibrant and 
care-free as every other young 
adult. 

As a much more explicitly 

Jewish alternative to “Broad 
City,” 
“Transparent” 
also 

finds a way to show Jews as 
ordinary members of society 
while recognizing the religious 
aspects 
of 
their 
identities. 

In each of its four seasons, 
“Transparent” explored the rich, 
complicated history behind the 
rich, 
complicated 
Pfefferman 

family. The show’s beginning 
skimmed the surface of modern 
Jewish family life. It introduced 
a rabbi character (Kathryn Hahn, 
“I Love Dick”) and depicted 
scenes of a Shabbat dinner and 
an unsuccessful preparation for 
youngest child Ali’s (Cleo Fraser, 
“Chronic”) Bat Mitzvah. The 
second season expanded on the 
first season’s religious themes, 

tracing 
Maura’s 
transgender 

identity all the way back to her 
aunt Gittel (Hari Nef, “Let Me 
Die a Nun”) in Nazi-controlled 
Europe.

The third and fourth seasons 

took on more current issues 
in 
the 
Jewish 
community, 

covering topics ranging from the 
Israeli/Palestinian 
conflict 
to 

synagogue bureaucracy. Though 
the show occasionally drifts 
into problematic territory — the 
Pfefferman 
matriarch 
Shelly 

(Judith 
Light, 
“Ugly 
Betty”) 

plays into the Jewish mother 
stereotype almost to a fault — 
“Transparent” is a standard 
example of how modern day Jews 
navigate the everyday world, 
confronting the traumas of their 
own history in order to come to 
terms with their present. 

In contrast to the relatively 

accurate 
representations 
of 

Jews 
in 
“Broad 
City” 
and 

“Transparent,” 
other 
Jewish-

themed shows like HBO’s “Curb 
Your Enthusiasm” and Hulu’s 

“Difficult People” — both of 
which are also starring, written 
and created by Jews — have a 
tendency to make Jews seem 
unlikable.

“Curb” creator and star Larry 

David is no stranger to causing 
controversy among the Jewish 
community, given his sardonic, 
neurotic humor and pointed, 
sometimes offensive observations 
on Jewish culture. While his 
most popular work, “Seinfeld,” 
was a huge success and a primary 
catalyst for Jewish representation 
on TV, David reinforces the 
worst possible tropes of Jews 
on “Curb.” He yells at crying 
widows at funerals to shut up, 
chastising unruly children and 
their overbearing parents during 
Passover seders and doodling 
Swastikas in textbooks. Then 
again, 
David 
makes 
fun 
of 

himself throughout the show — a 
character calls him a “self-hating 
Jew,” and David responds, “I do 
hate myself, but it has nothing to 
do with being Jewish.” 

COMEDY CENTRAL

I love female friendship

Hulu’s “Difficult People,” too, 

satirizes some absurd facets of 
Jewish culture. Billy Eichner 
(“American Horror Story: Cult”) 
and 
Julie 
Klausner 
(“Bob’s 

Burgers”) play two struggling 
writers who constantly make fun 
of other people, as well as their 
own Jewish heritage. The two 
venture to Friday night services as 
an excuse to network with Jews in 
the entertainment industry, make 
Adolf Hitler a character in their TV 
pitch to NBC and attempt to avoid 

their stereotypically insufferable 
Jewish families. Similar to “Broad 
City,” “Difficult People” tackles 
various trends in Jewish life and 
the 
increasing 
disillusionment 

toward religious practice among 
Jews today, though arguably to 
a much more provocative and 
exaggerated degree. 

Despite how these four shows 

differ in their views toward 
Judaism, they each incorporate 
an honest depiction of Jewish life. 
In some ways, the stereotypes 

in “Difficult People” and “Curb 
Your Enthusiasm” do illuminate 
some truths about the attitudes 
and beliefs of Jews today, but they 
don’t always get at the root of 
what makes Judaism so complex 
and compelling like in “Broad 
City” and “Transparent.” Part of 
what makes TV so entertaining 
as a medium is being able to not 
only see ourselves portrayed 
on-screen, but also to see the 
subtle nuances of our identities in 
those portrayals.

For the average 

moviegoer, 

Muslims are held 

to a different 
standard than 
everyone else

BAD MASCOT

They’re coming back!
Hertler & The Rainbow 
Seekers to play 2 nights

The Michigan natives return to the Blind Pig for a weekend stay

“You can have these really 

crazy, intense shows there. That 
kind of grungy environment just 
propagates intimacy; it’s a special 
kind of intimacy. Some of my 
favorite shows of all time have 
been at the Blind Pig,” said Joe 
Hertler in an interview with The 
Daily.

Fresh, funky and a little far-

out, the pop band Joe Hertler & 
The Rainbow Seekers is set for a 
two-night return to the Pig this 
weekend. I’m dancing already.

“We probably met, I want to 

say, five, six years ago. We were 
all in college. Half the band went 
to Central Michigan and half went 
to Michigan State,” Hertler said. 
“We were kind of just jamming 
in college and playing co-ops 
and stuff like that, and it slowly 
developed into something that 
was a little more involving.”

The group consists of Hertler 

(vocals, guitar and lyrics), Micah 
Bracken 
(keyboard), 
Jason 

Combs 
(bass), 

Aaron 
Stinson 

(saxophone), 
Rick 

Hale (drums), Ryan 
Hoger (guitar) and 
Kevin 
Pritchard 

(producer, bass).

Despite 
echoes 

of Edward Sharpe’s 
soul and Vulfpeck’s 
funk, 
Hertler’s 

songs often blossom 
from alt-rock. He’ll 
write a demo, then 
give it to the band, 
at which point the 
groovier elements 
start to bubble up 
as they work their 
Rainbow 
Seeker 

magic on it.

“Growing 
up 

in the ’90s, that 
was the music I 
connected to. It was the music 
that I first engaged with, which is 
kind of how it is for everyone from 

age 16 to their mid-20s. You know, 
those formative years where the 

music you listen to 
is what you tend 
to identify with,” 
Hertler 
said. 
“I 

guess that’s where 
the 
love 
affairs 

really started.”

Never 
having 

skyrocketed 
in 

popularity, 
the 

Rainbow 
Seekers 

have been gradually 
expanding 
their 

fervent fan base 
over 
the 
years. 

Each show is bigger 
than the last, and 
the group is driven 
by pure passion.

“It’s just really 

fun,” Hertler said. 
“All of us do other 
things, but so much 
of it is just part of 

your identity.”

On the band’s off-months, he 

works for the American Cancer 

ARYA NAIDU

Society and teaches English. To 
keep their experiences colorful, 
the Rainbow Seekers try to 
revamp a couple tracks each year.

“I’ve never been more excited 

to play ‘Jetski,’ of all songs,” 
Hertler said. “I’m always thankful 
that people like certain songs and 
respond well to them, but to redo 
them — while the core of the song 
is still the same — to have some 
things that have been changed is a 
fun challenge,” Hertler said.

Michigan-bred and Michigan-

based, JH+TRS love, love, love 
their Michiganders. They’ve built 
a rainbow-seeking family through 
the band, and they carry pieces of 
home with them wherever they go.

“We’ve had opportunities to 

leave the state, and we’ve thought 
about it, as every band does … but 
this is our home. A couple years 
ago, we decided to stick it out 
here. If it doesn’t work out, that’s 
alright,” Hertler said. “One of the 
nice things about Michigan is that 
a lot of people leave and go to other 
places. When we go to Denver or 
LA or NY — just a lot of big cities 
— there’s always a couple hundred 
Michiganders.”

JH+TRS 
radiate 
a 
certain 

warmth that lets them exist in a 
lane of their own within the funk-
pop landscape. They don’t take 
themselves too seriously, and every 
inch of their success is welcomed 
with nothing but gratitude. I met 
Hertler at the Espresso Royale 
on State, and it felt more like 
catching up with a friend than an 
interview. They’re a groovy bunch, 
and everything from their earnest 
lyrics to their smooth rhythms to 
their name itself is just one massive 
bear-hug.

The Rainbow Seekers’s most 

recent album, Pluto, is stunning in 
its existence as both heartbreaking 
and dance-inducing. I’m not a fan 
of using the word “real” to describe 
music, much less people, but this 
album — this band — is real in every 
sense of the word. They’re genuine 
in their joy and human in their 
heartache, and they’re all about 
connecting with people through 
unsullied authenticity.

“I think the focus of the music 

has always been the live show,” 
Hertler said. “Music is this form 
of communication, and when that 
communication is locked in, there’s 
a buzz you get. It’s in those tender 
moments where the magic is. I 
hate to be like, ‘It’s magical! It’s 
spiritual!’ But it is, in a way.”

Welcoming Ann Arbor like a 

second home, Joe Hertler & The 
Rainbow Seekers will play the 
Blind Pig this Friday and Saturday.
