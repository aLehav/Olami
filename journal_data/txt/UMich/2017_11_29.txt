The Michigan Daily sat down 

for an interview with University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
to 

address several current issues 
on campus, including a potential 
visit 
from 
Richard 
Spencer, 

Central Student Government’s 
vote for #UMDivest and more.

The Michigan Daily: Starting 

with Richard Spencer — in the 
Regent’s Meeting called last 
week, safety seemed like a big 
topic of discussion, that’s your 
top priority that you’re stating in 
your negotiations and that was a 
major concern for students. So, in 

the negotiation process, how are 
you defining safety? Obviously 
there are many components, 
physical, mental and emotional, 
but how do you work through 
that?

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel: I think the most 
unambiguous one is the physical 
safety of our community, and not 
just our students but the people 
that will come here, or may come 
here, to protest for or against 
and the safety of the speaker, the 
physical safety of the speaker and 
then of Ann Arbor. You know, 
the town and the University are 
intimately linked and we want 
to be sure as we move forward, if 
we do move forward, that we’re 
taking everyone’s physical safety 

On 
Tuesday 
evening, 
a 

crowd of about 100 students, 
faculty 
and 
community 

members joined together in 
the Diag for the #StopSpencer 
Speak Out with one common 
message: Richard Spencer is 
not welcome at the University 
of Michigan.

The Speak Out was one of 

the 11 #StopSpencer Week of 
Action events taking place 
to protest the University’s 
decision to cooperate with 
Spencer — an American white 
supremacist — and his team’s 
request to speak on campus. 
The event was organized by 
a coalition of student groups 
including Stop Spencer at 
the University of Michigan, 
Students4Justice and more. 
The goal of the Speak Out was 
to offer individuals who feel 
they have been ignored by the 
administration a platform to 
voice their concerns.

Many 
speakers 
and 

audience 
members 
at 
the 

event 
expressed 
their 

frustration 
with 
the 

University’s willingness to 
put the safety and comfort of 
minority students at risk in 
order to work with Spencer’s 
request.

One of these individuals 

was LSA junior Alex Chow, 
who explained by choosing 
not to deny Spencer’s request, 

the University was leaving 
students of color to fend for 
themselves.

“The University and its 

administration has made it 
clear that they’re not going 
to protect us so we have to 
protect 
ourselves,” 
Chow 

said. “The burden is now 
put on people of color, LGBT 
people, Muslim people and 
Jewish people. All of us have 
to protect ourselves because 

they refuse to say ‘no.’”

Chow also felt the issue 

involving Spencer was not one 
of free speech, but instead one 
involving hate speech.

“They’re claiming that they 

can’t say no to him because 
there is a risk of litigation, but 
they’ve said no to speakers in 
the past,” Chow said. “They 
have a world-renowned law 
school, but I don’t think that’s 
what the main issue is. The 

issue is that someone wants to 
come here and tell us that we 
shouldn’t exist, and that we 
should be killed, and that our 
lives aren’t important.”

Calls for continued action 

against Spencer were heard at 
the Speak Out, whether it be 
student laborers refusing to 
work for the Spencer event or 
students continuing to show 
up at events in protest.

The 
Central 
Student 

Government meeting Tuesday 
night 
revisited 
the 
recent 

passing of #UMDivest and the 
prospect of white supremacist 
Richard Spencer speaking on the 
University of Michigan’s campus.

Post #UMDivest debate
The meeting began with a 

guest presentation from history 
professor Victor Lieberman, who 
had not been allowed to speak at 
the divestment resolution vote 
after objections arose from CSG 
representatives. These objections 
stemmed from a concern that 
Lieberman, who has taught on the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, would cause 
a power imbalance during the vote 
by expressing his anti-divestment 
views.

While speaking to the assembly, 

Lieberman 
took 
a 
historical 

approach to examining the Arab-
Israeli conflict, citing examples of 
human rights violations by other 
countries, which he believes to be 
greater than the alleged violations 
by Israel.

“Because there’s a growing 

American political lobby against

Students on the Diag gather to protest the University’s consideration of hosting Richard Spencer Tuesday.

ADMINISTRATION

Handmade posters littered 

the floor of the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization office 
on East Liberty Street while 
a 
half-open 
laptop 
played 

music on Monday night. On 
the whiteboard, someone had 
written several guiding slogans 
in blue Expo marker; “Hail Not 
Heil” 
and 
“#SchlisselWYA” 

provided go-to options should 
inspiration otherwise fail. Stop 
Spencer at the University of 
Michigan, a coalition of student 
organizations 
protesting 

the University’s decision to 

proceed with negotiations with 
Richard Spencer, began their 
Week of Action with a sign-
making party.

It was a calm start to what 

has been a week packed with 
teach-ins, student walkouts and 
rallies, all aiming to dissuade 
the University from giving 
Spencer, a white supremacist 
and 
Nazi 
sympathizer, 
a 

platform to speak.

Nearly a dozen left-leaning 

groups 
on 
campus 
have 

banded together to organize 
in 
opposition 
to 
Spencer’s 

request, from radfun and the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats to the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization.

into account. 

TMD: What kinds of things are 

you going to specifically, in the 
negotiations, what kinds of things 
do you think could contribute 
to making a more or less safe 
environment?

Schlissel: What the law allows 

us to consider is the time and the 
place and the manner of speaking. 
So for example, it would be very 
easy for us to say no if Mr. Spencer 
insisted on speaking on the Diag 
at 11 in the morning on a class day 
with a bullhorn. Right? Because 
he would disrupt everyone’s class. 
So, using that as an example, what 
we would look for is a time of 
the day and time of the year and 
a location that our professional 
security people tell us is the safest 
possible way to do this. It would 
be silly to discuss these things 
in public and these are things 
that we want to discuss with Mr. 
Spencer’s representatives to figure 
out whether we can do something 
that’s safe.

TMD: 
So 
then 
in 
the 

negotiations going forward, which 
voices will you consider? Are there 
any faculty or student organization 
voices which will take precedence 
over one another? Furthermore, 
is there an expected timeline for 

how long these deliberations may 
take?

Schlissel: I don’t know, I don’t 

want to prejudice them. I want 
to make clear again, I have no 
particular interest in hearing 
this person speak and I have no 

particular interest in having this 
person come to the University of 
Michigan. The idea is that he’s 
made a request to rent a room, and

we’re obligated to consider that 
request without consideration 
of what he wants to talk about 
so with that in mind, as I’ve said 
publicly, we’re certainly allowed 
to put restrictions on the time, 
place and manner of speech 
to maintain the safety of our 
community and to minimize the 
disruption to our mission, and 
that’s what we’ll try to do. You 
could think of ways we might 
do this, but I’m not going to 
describe in a newspaper article 
how the University is going to try 
to negotiate the safest possible 
way to do this, because that 
would be against our interest in 
doing it the safest possible way. 
If we do arrive at a way to move 
forward, we would certainly 
give our community plenty of 
notice, we would discuss with the 
community all of our best advice 
about how people can maintain 
their own personal safety, we 
would discuss ways to protest and 
to express yourselves if that’s what 

you want to do. We’ve promised 
to work with student groups 
and other groups on campus for 
alternative programming and if 
people want things in different 
places so they can be together 
with one another, rather than 
sitting around wondering what’s 
going on with this crazy person 
on a different part of our campus, 
so we’ll do all of those things but 
there’s not really much we can do 
until (we know) whether it would 
be possible to do this safely and 
when and where it would be, and 
we don’t know those things yet. 
You know, one thing I’m really 
concerned about and presuming 
you were going to ask me about 
this, is students are protesting this 
decision to determine whether 
we can move forward in a safe 
fashion, and some people have 
called for a boycott of classes, 
and one thing I’m very worried 
about is by expressing the way 
we feel about this person, we may 
be inadvertently playing into his 
hands and giving him material he 
can use for fundraising and giving 
him the sense of power that none 
of us think he deserves, I certainly 
don’t think he deserves. So I have 

this picture of this person sitting 
in a room somewhere laughing 
at us. Laughing at us because his 
asking to rent a room and come 
and say words are enough to have 
people decide they don’t want to 
go to class on Thursday, and I fear 
that we’re giving this man too 
much power over us.

TMD: Can you tell us who, 

besides 
you 
and 
Richard 

Spencer and his team, will be 
directly involved in those sort of 
negotiations?

Schlissel: I don’t want to 

discuss the details — it will 
be people that are trusted to 
understand the legal issues that 
are involved and the public safety 
issues involved.

TMD: And, as far as alternative 

events offered to students, is 
there anything in place yet? Or in 
the works?

Schlissel: No because we 

don’t know if or when he’s 
coming. What I can imagine 
is a series of events developed 
in collaboration with students 
and faculty for the same day he’s 
here if he does come here and 
then perhaps a moderate time 
thereafter of days or a week or 

two weeks after, a major 
event expressing different 
points of view that we 
might want to sponsor that 
more express our values. 
That 
remains 
abstract 

until we know whether 
he’s 
coming. 
Students 

have already been sending 
me suggestions for who 
they might like to see and 
here to express alternate 
viewpoints which is what 
we should be doing.

TMD: 
Before 
we 

shift topics, back to the 
resources 
you 
touched 

on — the student strike 
on Thursday, I think the 
idea behind that from 
protesters 
is 
that 
this 

kind of organizing and 
resistance takes a lot of 
time and effort, that maybe 
distracts from —

Schlissel: 
From 
their 

studies, and what they’re 
trying to accomplish as 
students.

communications director for 
the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, said in the 
past they have been cautious in 
attaching their name to certain 
causes to avoid politicization, 
“opting instead to show up 
as allies rather than political 
affiliates.”

“In this instance, however, 

we believe that Spencer and 
his movement are enough of 
a political threat to justify 
our 
direct 
involvement,” 

Schandevel said. “Our goal — 
which I think is the main goal 
of many of the other student 
groups involved — is to protect 
marginalized students from 
violence. Spencer’s presence 
on 
university 
campuses 
— 

and 
frankly 
anywhere 
— 

brings 
heightened 
tensions 

with it. Not to mention if his 
supporters show up to see him 
speak, we could be hosting a 
Nazi rally on campus in the 
name of free speech. That isn’t 
a safe environment for anyone, 
let alone the students targeted 
by his rhetoric.”

In an email to students, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel emphasized student 
safety is his utmost priority, 
and 
a 
deciding 
factor 
in 

whether Spencer’s event will 
take place.

“If we cannot assure a 

reasonably safe setting for the 
event, we will not allow it to go 
forward,” Schlissel wrote.

Students4Justice, 
one 

of 
the 
primary 
organizers 

of 
#StopSpencer, 
issued 
a 

statement 
responding 
to 

Schlissel’s email, claiming it 
will be impossible for safety to 
be ensured if Spencer speaks. 
They 
cited 
previous 
racist 

incidents on campus and noted 
the University boasts one of 
the 
country’s 
largest 
state 

militias, a KKK base in Howell, 
30 minutes away from Ann 
Arbor, members of which tend 
to support white supremacy. 

“There is no ‘safe’ setting 

possible 
when 
white 

supremacists and neo-Nazis 
are given permission to come 
to 
college 
campuses,” 
the 

statement read.

In his email, Schlissel also 

mentioned the potential legal 
complications the University 
could face if they bar Spencer 
from 
speaking. 
Spencer’s 

lawyer previously threatened 
to sue the University if they did 
not reach a decision by Nov. 24; 
now, however, the University 
has until Dec. 8 to make a 
decision. 

“We are legally prohibited 

from blocking such requests 
based solely on the content of 
that speech, however sickening 
it is,” Schlissel said.

History professor Katherine 

French doesn’t believe these 
legal problems are enough 
grounds for allowing Spencer 
to speak.

“I’d rather that the money 

we’re going to have to spend on 
security be spent on actually 
arguing that this isn’t about 
education 
and 
about 
free 

speech, this is about safety,” 
French said.

Spencer 
has 
requested 

to speak at various other 
universities, 
including 

Michigan State University and 
Ohio State University.

“It seems like the rivalry 

between 
Michigan 
and 

Ohio 
State 
should 
maybe 

be 
invoked,” 
French 
said. 

“They’ve turned him down. 
I’m not fully convinced on 
President 
Schlissel’s 
stand. 

With one of the top-ranked 
law schools in the country I’m 
sure we have faculty who could 
articulate this point in a court 
of law.”

Amanda 
Delekta, 
vice 

president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
said 
while 
she 
disagrees 

with Spencer and the “alt-
right” movement, he should 
be allowed to speak if student 
safety can be ensured.

“I don’t think anyone wants 

Spencer to be able to speak on 
campus, but he has the same 
First Amendment rights that 
every other American citizen 
has,” Delekta said. “If the 
proper safety procedures and 
precautions are put into place, 
I don’t see how the University 
can 
justify 
preventing 
his 

speech.”

Schandevel agreed student 

safety 
was 
of 
paramount 

importance.

“It is our biggest priority,” 

Schandevel said. “That, and 
making sure Nazis don’t have a 
platform anywhere.”

Students4Justice and other 

organizers 
also 
called 
on 

faculty and staff to walk out 
of classes Wednesday and to 
cancel classes on Thursday 
to show support for students 
“who 
have 
been 
affected 

by 
our 
oppressive 
campus 

environment.”

French said she plans on 

walking out of class. 

“I’m glad the students are 

protesting,” French said. “I 
don’t think Spencer belongs on 
our campus. And I don’t think 
it’s a free speech issue.”

French 
currently 
teaches 

a class titled “The Rise and 
Fall of the Middle Ages.” She 
said the “alt-right”’ attempts 
to “co-opt medieval history” 
in order to legitimize white 
supremacy worry her.

“I’m 
pretty 
concerned 

about the level of legitimacy 
that white supremacy is being 
given,” French said. “I don’t 
want my class to be construed 
in any way as supporting that 
agenda. It’s a wrong reading 
of medieval history. I’m pretty 
anxious about what all this 
means.”

Philip Christman, co-chair 

of the Lectures’ Employee 
Organization, 
said 
he 

appreciates students are taking 
action. He especially admires 
the statement takes note of 

the fact not everyone is able to 
participate in all the events. 

“They seemed to kind of 

acknowledge that canceling 
classes doesn’t really mean the 
same thing for every teacher,” 
Christman said. “For a person 
with tenure or a grad student 
or a lecturer like me, we 
might face different kinds of 
sanctions. They left some room 
in their statement. They talked 
about, whether you cancel 
classes or not, think about how 
you can offer extra support to 
your students of color and your 
Jewish students who are really 
bearing the brunt of all this.”

Christman 
believes 
the 

faculty’s 
main 
role 
should 

be 
providing 
support 
and 

educating 
students 
on 
the 

larger picture behind Spencer 
speaking.

“We have to give context and 

help our students understand 
why 
this 
is 
happening,” 

Christman said. “I think some 
acknowledgement of the larger 
context and finding whatever 
gestures you can make to help 
your students is important.”

In emails sent to LSA and 

School of Education list servs, 
Dean 
Andrew 
Martin 
and 

Elizabeth 
Birr 
Moje, 
dean 

of the School of Education, 
informed 
faculty 
members 

classes would not be canceled 
Thursday 
in 
response 
to 

Spencer’s visit or the protests.

“The most important thing 

we do as educators is to teach, 
and for that reason, we do 
not support calls by students 
and faculty to cancel classes,” 
Martin wrote.

Associate 
Dean 
Angela 

Dillard said while the group 
of associate deans who helped 
write the statement along with 
Martin don’t agree on how 
the University should handle 
Spencer’s visit, they all believe 
that “this is a time to teach and 
be in the classroom.”

“My personal hope is that 

my colleagues teaching on 
Thursday will use this as an 
opportunity 
to 
teach 
hard 

and 
teach 
well, 
and 
that 

they’ll consider turning over 
some valuable class time for 
discussions and debates about 
democratic engagement, anti-
racist education and the unique 
role that college campuses 
have played in debates about 
free speech and the right to 
protest,” Dillard said. 

The Semester in Detroit 

Program 
recently 
released 

a statement in support of 
the Stop Spencer Protests. 
Program Director Dr. Stephen 
Ward 
said 
the 
University 

should have no role in helping 
Spencer propagate his views.

“I don’t think we should 

describe him as provocative 
and radical, because those 
give 
him 
more 
legitimacy 

than he deserves,” Ward said. 
“He’s a purveyor of hateful 
and 
potentially 
harmful, 

violent and deadly language. 
That’s beyond controversial 
or provocative. It’s incendiary, 
it’s hateful.”

#STOPSPENCER
From Page 1A

Public Health student Dana 

Greene was one of the people 
who took the stage at the 
Speak Out. Greene reminded 
the audience that by refusing 
to be complicit, the power of 
the University does not lie 
with the administration, but 
instead with the student body.

“President 
Schlissel 
and 

the Regents don’t run this 
campus, the students and the 
faculty and staff do,” Greene 
said. “So if we take a stand 
collectively 
then 
we 
can 

prevent this from happening 
but if we are complicit and 
willing to stand by and let it 
happen, then that’s what we 
allow to happen.”

History 
lecturer 
Anne 

Berg also spoke, pointing out 
the lack of faculty members 
present, and called on them 
to come out and support 
the efforts of marginalized 
communities.

“I see my students in fear, 

I see that they’re not just 
terrified about what’s going 
to happen to them but they 
also feel terribly alone,” Berg 
said. “The leadership is really 
absent, and the people who 
are supposed to be experts 
and guiding the students are 
not guiding them.”

Greene also echoed Berg’s 

call 
for 
the 
involvement 

from more members of the 
University community, and 
emphasized the need to stand 
up for one another, even if 
the issues at hand may not be 
directly pertinent to everyone.

“I want to make a call to 

people who are here and those 
who are not, that we can’t be 
complicit and allow this to 
happen,” Greene said. “Even 
if 
white 
supremacy 
don’t 

affect you, which it should, 
it affects everybody, but if 
your identity isn’t directly 
targeted by that you should 
still feel compelled to come 
out because it’s not just about 
me, it’s not just about you, it’s 
about everybody.”

Moving 
forward, 
Berg 

hopes the University decides 
to reject Spencer’s request 

even if it means losing a legal 
battle.

“I hope that they go the 

legal route, that they deny 
the request, withdraw from 
negotiations and let this go 
to court,” Berg said. “Yes, we 
may lose, but then there is a 
record that we fought.”

She also explained it was 

unjust for the University to 
comply with Spencer, when so 
many other schools are facing 
lawsuits for standing up to 
him.

“I don’t think that it’s fair 

that other institutions have 
taken that route, and that we 
are basically throwing them 
under the bus,” Berg said. “I 
don’t think this is an issue of 
free speech, I think this is an 
issue that is mobilized in ways 
that are really problematic.”

In 
terms 
of 
safety 
on 

campus, there was a large 
consensus 
that 
rejecting 

Spencer’s 
talk 
of 
white 

supremacy is the most certain 
way of ensuring that people, 
especially people of color, on 
campus will not be harmed.

“It 
doesn’t 
advance 

learning, it does not advance 
education — that doesn’t help 
anything,” Berg said. “All it 
does is inspire violence and 
hatred, and giving that a 
platform puts people’s lives at 
stake.”

Later 
Tuesday 
night, 

students gathered at Rackham 
Auditorium for a teach-in on 
free and hate speech, white 
supremacy, and anti-fascist 
organizing. Throughout the 
event, a group of panelists and 
students examined the distinction 
between these components in 
addition to emphasizing the 
importance 
of 
all 
students’ 

safety, especially those from 
marginalized communities.

Assistant 
history 
professor 

Amanda Armstrong from the 
Michigan Society of Fellows, a 
speaker at the event, discussed 
the issue behind increased police 
enforcement.

“The 
administration 
has 

decided the only way they 
can possibly deny Spencer the 
platform to speak is if the police 
department says that it’s not 
going to be safe,” she said. “I think 
even if the police decide they are 
not going to let him on campus, 

that sets as a norm this idea of 
intensifying policing in response 
to the events and protests on 
campus.”

Armstrong 
emphasized 

policing should not be prioritized 
when dealing with a controversial 
speaker — it should be the 
students.

“I think the grounds for 

denying 
Spencer 
a 
platform 

should have nothing to do with 
the police,” she said. “We should 
oppose the police being involved 
in this because it is making room 
for fascists, and we should not 
promote this type of work.”

Law student Lakshmi Gopal 

taught 
students 
the 
legal 

ramifications the University could 
have faced for denying Spencer 
the space to speak. While she was 
explaining the First Amendment 
structure to the crowd, Gopal also 
added she was not defending the 
administration’s rhetoric.

“Richard Spencer chose to rent 

a space from the University of 
Michigan. As a result, this puts 
the University at a completely 
different space. If there was 
an invitation to him, then the 
University of Michigan could 
have re-sent the invitation,” she 
explained. “The University of 
Michigan has to go through a fair 
process to deny his application.” 

Gopal added the University 

had another option.

“If the content of his event is 

in conflict with the fundamental 
purpose of the University, then 
the situation would be different,” 
she said. “The reality is if Richard 
Spencer comes and speaks here, 
the University of Michigan would 
have to protect his ability to speak 
without disturbance.”

LSA junior Chanelle Davis 

she said she was interested in 
learning the difference between 
free speech and hate speech. She 
said she also wanted to learn from 
different groups within the social 
justice realm.

“I feel there are so many 

different views, and with me 
being a Black student, I sometimes 
feel like my own community 
isn’t on the same page,” Davis 
said. “I believe it is important 
for me to continue to learn 
about different things outside 
of the classroom, and trying 
to get educated before I can 
do more in terms of activism 
personally.”

“The most important thing 

we do as educators is to teach, 
and for that reason, we do 
not support calls by students 
and faculty to cancel classes,” 
Martin wrote.

Martin 
and 
Moje 
both 

wrote they support the right 

of students to protest, but 
encouraged students not to 
participate in order not to 
give a platform to Spencer’s 
ideas.

“We 
urge 
you 
not 
to 

participate in such a protest, 
which gives power to the 
people who spread falsehoods 
and 
hate,” 
Moje 
wrote. 

“Instead, we urge you to teach 
your courses and use them 
as an opportunity to engage 

our students in discussions 
about free speech, the power 
of multiple perspectives, how 
to launch productive protests, 
and about the right to the 
opportunity to learn for all 
people.”

Both 
Martin 
and 
Moje 

also 
expressed 
their 

distaste for Spencer and his 
white 
supremacist 
beliefs, 

calling them “noxious” and 
“repugnant.”

STRIKE

Israel, but not against these other 
countries … that’s why,” he said, 
rhetorically asking why other 
countries are not facing a similar 
resolution.

Business 
junior 
Lauren 

Ward, a CSG representative, 
then questioned the purpose 
of Lieberman’s visit to the CSG 
chambers.

“Why come back and throw 

all of these clearly emotionally 
appealing persuasive arguments 
in student’s faces when that’s not 
at all the point of the resolution?” 
she asked.

Lieberman fired back: “You 

can’t judge international events 
on the base of your emotions … 
it requires an intellectual and 
historical analysis,” Lieberman 
responded.

A group of CSG representatives 

including 
LSA 
junior 
Ali 

Rosenblatt 
and 
Information 

senior Elle Shwer then took the 
podium to speak to their fellow 
student government members 
about the lack of respect they 
felt loomed over the divestment 
resolution vote two weeks ago.

“This assembly emboldened 

the BDS movement,” Andrew 
Watkins, a Public Policy senior, 
said. SAFE previously stated 
#UMDivest is not associated with 
the BDS movement. “They did 
not say a word to denounce the 
movement, and to me, that silence 
rings louder than anything else 
they said,” he said.

Watkins also brought up the 

swastika in the MLB bathroom 
the following day.

CSG Social Work Rep. Brittney 

Williams 
took 
issue 
with 

Lieberman’s appearance, calling 
his speech “scare-tactics cloaked 
as intellectual discourse.”

“I believe that he was here 

to attempt to put us back in our 
place,” she said. “He wanted to be 
here in person to rub our noses in 
what he believed to be the wrong 
decision.”

CSG Vice President Nadine 

Jawad, a Public Policy senior, 
and her support of #UMDivest 
during the resolution night were 
also called into question — one 
representative said she leveraged 
her status as vice president, 
creating a power imbalance.

Jawad, however, emphasized 

she spoke during community 
concerns 
and 
not 
executive 

communications.

“Are you all clear that I spoke 

during 
community 
concerns 

as opposed to during executive 
communications to try and share 
my narrative (despite) being an 
executive?” she said. “And though 
I know that it wasn’t a way to 
take away what I am as the vice 
president, it wasn’t my intent to 
abuse my power. Are you aware 
that other (executive) members 
including 
the 
president 
and 

former vice president of student 
body vocally supported a stance 
on the actual politics and not on 
the resolution?”

The 
resolution 
has 
been 

supported 
by 
many 
student 

organizations and social justice 
groups on campus including the 
School of Social Work Student 
Union and Black Student Union.

Richard Spencer resolution
Members 
of 
the 
coalition 

to Defend Affirmative Action, 
Integration, and Immigrant Rights 
and Fight For Equality By Any 
Means Necessary also asked CSG 
to pass a resolution to condemn 
white 
nationalist 
Richard 

Spencer’s possible visit to campus. 
The University administration 
said they are in talks about 
providing a space for Spencer, if 
safety is not compromised.

Kate Stenvig, an organizer for 

BAMN, drew connections both 
to the violence that unfolded in 
Charlottesville, Va., in August and 
to Michigan State University’s 
decision to not allow him to speak 
on campus.

“There are a lot of campuses 

that have denied him … and that 
doesn’t have anything to do with 
the First Amendment,” she said. 
“Everywhere Richard Spencer has 
gone has been accompanied with 
physical violence.”

CSG President Anushka Sarkar, 

an LSA senior, expressed the 
need to amend the resolution as 
it stands. She said the resolution 
should communicate that it is the 
threat to physical safety, not the 
content of Spencer’s speech, that is 
of concern.

“It’s pretty likely that University 

will go to court regardless,” she 
said. “If we pass a resolution that 
says that we reject him speaking 
here because of the content of his 
speech, they will use that to win 
the lawsuit. The resolution should 
focus on the fact that Spencer and 
his followers bring about violence.”

The resolution will be passed 

to the Resolutions Committee for 
further review.

M

y most anxious times 
used to be weekend 
nights. 

I 
remember 
spending 

countless 
Saturday 

nights staring out 
my window at the 
frozen landscape of 
campus — imagining 
that all of the lights 
from dorm rooms, 
apartments 
and 

houses were filled 
with 
students 

laughing, 
partying 

and 
just 
enjoying 

the few hours of 
downtime that college life grants.

And ignorantly, I deluded 

myself into believing that I was 
the only student whose first 
winter of college was dominated 
by this anxiety induced from 
the social obligation that seems 
to accompany dark hours — 
that my case was unique; I was 
the screwed up anomaly who 
was missing out on the college 
experience I had been led to 
believe existed.

While everyone else was 

out 
interacting, 
building 

friendships and relationships, I 
had locked myself in my fourth 
floor dorm room with a stack of 
paperbacks and a Netflix app 
that constantly asked if I was 
still watching “Mad Men.”

There is nothing wrong with 

being alone, but that first year 
I fell into an unhealthy cycle 
of self-hatred that I believe 
thousands of kids experience, 
started by the pressure to 
adjust from home to college 
life, constantly measuring their 
social success against others.

Because 
what 
is 
never 

conveyed to young kids arriving 
to college is just how profoundly 
difficult it is to make that 
transition at this point in their 
lives and, more importantly, 
how it is not instantaneous.

From the outside, I was 

always looking at the lives of 
kids who so easily adapted and 
integrated. Yet that blatantly 

selfish 
viewpoint 
prevented 

me from seeing the others 
experiencing the same shit I 
was going through every day. 

And instead of taking 
a breath, asking for 
help or breaking out 
of my reserved social 
self, I did the worst 
thing I could’ve done.

I 
wished 
that 

the 
next 
years 
of 

college would fly by. 
I proceeded to spend 
too 
many 
nights 

angry 
at 
myself 

for 
not 
instantly 

jumping into the ideal life I 
had imagined existed during 
those “four greatest years of 
your life.”

How much I regret that now.
Because 
as 
my 
college 

experience now comes to a 
close, one of the most important 
lessons I’ve learned is how 
precious your time is. That is 
a lesson that is unbelievably 
difficult to convey to young 
people, because in our minds it 
feels like we’ll be kids forever. 
It feels like the present day 
life will never end, that the 
passage of time has selfishly 
stopped for us.

But 
it 
doesn’t, 
and 
the 

opportunity 
and 
privilege 

we have here as students is 
something not to be wasted. 
Time is precious and wasting it 
stressing over your social image 
or how you have not yet fit in — 
all of that eats away at literally 
some of the most invaluable 

moments of our lives.

This adjustment varies in 

degrees of difficulty from person 
to person, but upon arriving 
here, 
understand 
that 
your 

home and high school image of 
yourself are unknown, that you 
have to break out of that comfort 
zone completely, and that you’re 
never going back to that life.

So, actually taking the time 

to meet new people, to knock 
on new doors, to try things you 
never thought you would — 
all add up and begin to shape 
the actual character of who 
you really are. Find a radically 
diverse number of social groups 
and see what makes sense. Try 
everything, instead of being 
upset over nothing.

As someone who has been 

in nearly every social setting 
this city offers, from punk rock 
concerts to political debate 
clubs, sorority formals to drag 
shows, I can say that every 
single one of those experiences 
has helped me understand a 
little bit more about who the hell 
I really am.

And as college will end for 

me in the next few months, the 
time I do look back on happily 
are the times I branched out — 
when I decided to leave that 
comfort zone, to try these new 
things, and most importantly 
incorporate 
them 
into 
life 

going forward.

Because eventually, at some 

point, you’ll run into something 
or someone that clicks, as a few 
things did for me. When that 
happens, it is incredible how 
that pressure and stress literally 
evaporate, how suddenly you 
feel like you belong. This campus 
is full of students feeling the 
exact same nervous way, I can 
guarantee that.

Relax. Enjoy your college 

experience. It will be over 
before you know it.

I

f you have ever set foot in 
Ann Arbor, you know why it’s 
called “tree city.” And we are 

not talking about the fall foliage — 
we are referring to weed.

Ever since Ann Arbor first 

decriminalized 
marijuana 

consumption 
in 
the 
1970s, 

the city has been associated 
nationally with relatively open 
attitudes for the plant that 
persist to this day. The Michigan 
Daily has previously reported 
on current student attitudes 
regarding cannabis and found 
that the student body is generally 
receptive. 
Several 
medical 

marijuana 
dispensaries 
are 

located on the periphery of the 
University of Michigan campus, 
but do students really know the 
ins and outs on the implications 
of cannabis?

This is why Students for 

Sensible Drug Policy and Green 
Wolverine (affiliated with the Ross 
School of Business) seek to educate 
students on the nature of cannabis 
and all of its consequences for 
public health, policy and business. 
On Dec. 3, we are hosting the 
first annual Michigan Cannabis 
Leaders Summit in order to fulfill 
this goal.

While 
the 
legalization 

of 
recreational 
marijuana 

in 
Michigan 
is 
potentially 

imminent, our state is in need 
of deep reckoning. As students 
at the University of Michigan, 
we find that the time is right 
to get other students involved 
in the countless facets of the 
recreational marijuana industry.

The 
joint 
effort 
between 

members of the University’s 
chapter of SSDP and Green 
Wolverine is one of shared 
outlooks regarding how students 
can become acquainted with 
cannabis. 
This 
familiarity 

should 
not 
just 
be 
limited 

to getting high; there is an 
entire cannabis industry in its 
infancy which needs future 
lawyers, policymakers, doctors, 
researchers, 
business 
leaders 

and many other professionals to 
carry out the industry’s vitality 
and legitimacy.

However, we recognize that 

students may not have positive 
beliefs regarding cannabis or, 
for that matter, may not know 
much at all regarding its usage. 
These student concerns need to 
be addressed. This is why SSDP 
and Green Wolverine both wish to 
educate the University community 
on the implications of cannabis 
under new legal circumstances.

Firstly, what is marijuana 

from a medical perspective? 
Marijuana can be used for a 
variety of ailments, including 
chronic pain, dementia and 
HIV/AIDS. Marijuana, for its 
medical application, need not 
be limited in use to the most 
severe of ailments; in its varying 
methods 
of 
consumption, 

marijuana may also be used as 
a prophylactic. While marijuana 
was popularized as a means to 
get high, cannabis consumption 
in general does not always lead 
to a psychoactive response. 
For 
example, 
cannabidiol, 

commonly 
known 
as 
CBD, 

contains 
no 
psychoactive 

elements and has a multitude of 
medical benefits.

As 
mentioned 
before, 
the 

campaign to put recreational 
marijuana on the ballot in 2018 
looks promising. If passed by the 
majority of Michigan voters next 
year, our state would look more 
or less like the states in which 
marijuana is legalized, such as 
Colorado and the seven other 
states excluding the District 
of Columbia that have already 
passed 
legalization 
measures. 

The ballot initiative up for 
consideration in Michigan, for 
example, would set up a system for 
taxation on marijuana purchases, 
give local governments the ability 
to govern how marijuana is sold 
in their communities and allow 
individuals to grow up to 12 
marijuana plants at home, among 
other provisions.

However, the exact rollout — 

which is contingent upon whether 
or not the legalization proposal 
will be on the ballot — remains 
to be seen. Though the initiative 
received many more signatures 
than is required by state law, the 
secretary of state must decide 

whether or not to respect the 
wishes of the 360,000 Michigan 
voters who signed the proposal.

For 
students 
looking 
to 

achieve a career in the cannabis 
industry, the time is ripe. New 
businesses will need to facilitate 
the 
production, 
distribution 

and 
sales 
of 
recreational 

marijuana once Michigan votes 
for legalization. Other business 
models are also needed: ancillary 
businesses (who do not “touch 
the plant”) must also be taken 
into account. These businesses 
include 
those 
dealing 
in 

scientific testing, technology and 
even private equity. According 
to the Detroit Free Press, full 
legalization would bring about 
$1 billion in sales annually in 
Michigan. This is an opportunity 
that must be seized.

The event, which includes 

a panel of experts in science, 
medicine, policy, activism and 
business, will be a worthwhile 
experience 
where 
students 

should expect to walk away with 
a clear picture of the still inchoate 
cannabis industry in Michigan. 
Aside 
from 
the 
educational 

component of the event, there 
will be networking opportunities 
with the panelists in addition 
to prize giveaways from our 
sponsors.

We hope this event will be a 

way for students to understand 
both 
the 
complexities 
and 

accessibility of the cannabis 
environment in Michigan. There 
could not be a more fitting time 
for this to occur. 

The 
Michigan 
Cannabis 

Leaders Summit will be held 
in 
the 
Robertson 
Auditorium 

located within the Ross School of 
Business on Dec. 3 from 3:00 p.m. 
to 6:00 p.m. Confirmed attendees 
include state Rep. Yousef Rabhi 
(D-Ann Arbor), former state Rep. 
Jeff Irwin and Stephen Goldner, 
an adviser to the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration. Additional 
attendees will come from various 
professions in law, science and 
business. The event will include 
a 
combination 
of 
interactive 

lectures, discussions, live music 
and networking.

The stretch

STEPHANIE MULLINGS | COLUMN

J

ust a few weeks ago, 
when the IFC announced 
it 
would 
temporarily 

suspend all social events, I 
remember saying to myself, 
“That’s a stretch.” However, 
not for the reasons you may 
think. I didn’t think it was a 
stretch because the decision 
was harsh or uncalled for. I 
thought this because social 
media 
and 
campus 
news 

outlets blew up immediately 
following the release of this 
decision. On Twitter people 
made statements like, “ALL 
of umich Greek life got shut 
down until further notice,” 
and published overdramatic 
analyses on why the world 
could 
potentially 
implode 

because of the lack of date 
parties this season. 

The stretch to me is that 

such a dense population of 
the student body believes the 
fraternities 
that 
encompass 

the IFC social organizations 
represent 
the 
entirety 
of 

University of Michigan Greek 
life. This couldn’t be further 
from the truth.

I have no ties to Greek life, nor 

do I intend to in the near future. 
I do not want this to be viewed 
as me being a “hater” or “anti-
Greek.” I offer this as a reasonably 
fair assessment of what I have 
observed in the Greek scene for 
the last three years.

Did you know all nine of 

the historically Black Greek 
fraternities 
and 
sororities 

have 
been 
represented 
on 

campus throughout University 
history and that they form a 
Panhellenic 
council? 
What 

about 
historically 
Latino 

fraternities 
and 
Latina 

sororities? I have also seen 
dedication 
to 
community 

service 
represented 
in 

Michigan Greek life and in pre-
professional organizations.

So why is it that now the IFC 

has been suspended, “ALL of 
umich Greek life got shut down!”

I am not sure about you, 

but I felt personally offended 
for those who were indirectly 
excluded 
from 
Michigan 

Greek life in the wake of 

the IFC suspension. It’s like 
getting invited to a party, 
going and having a great 
time, only to find out later 
that it wasn’t actually a good 
party because the “cool” kids 
didn’t show up. Even before 
this, when first arriving to 
campus, I could notice the 
very large divide between IFC 
Greek life and the remainder, 
which includes multicultural, 
pre-professional and service 
fraternities and sororities.

I can say with 100 percent 

confidence 
that 
in 
three 

years I have never been to an 
IFC social event, including 
tailgates, 
parties, 
date 

parties… all of these sorts of 

things. I can also say that the 
majority of my closest friends 
on campus have not either. Yet 
we have all attended Michigan 
Greek life events. That being 
said — and this is just a hunch 
here — I highly doubt that 
Michigan Greek life is “resting 
in peace.”

I am sure that students on 

campus know there is more to 
Greek life at the University than 
the IFC and its social functions. 
However, that knowledge was 
not reflected in the general 
commentary 
regarding 
the 

news of the IFC suspension. 
Thus, 
the 
implication 
that 

the IFC is what “makes” the 
University’s Greek life is a 
dangerous one.

Sure, a vast majority of 

students may love tailgates 
and date parties sponsored 
by IFC fraternities, but is this 
social aspect of the University 
too much of a vacuum? What 
I mean to say is, is the student 

body getting so sucked into 
the social ongoings of the 
fraternities 
encompassed 
in 

the IFC that they are blind to 
other diverse portions of the 
University’s Greek life?

It is extremely important we 

make campus a truly inclusive 
environment. Though it may 
be seemingly minor to let this 
extend to Greek life on campus, 
it is still relevant to maintain the 
ideals of a holistic and welcoming 
environment for all, despite what 
is considered “popular.”

As a campus tour guide 

— I know, I am one of those 
annoying people who blocks 
major entrances and exits to 
buildings with groups of parents 
— I tell visitors that about 20 
percent of the undergraduate 
student body is involved in 
Greek life. I always follow this 
up by saying, “This includes 
pre-professional 
and 
service 

fraternities as well.” I became 
so 
pressed 
with 
questions 

about things like “bidding” 
and “rushing” by incoming 
freshmen, and I had absolutely 
no idea what this meant.

Accustomed to the inner 

workings of historically Black 
Greek life, which encompasses 
an entirely different “rushing” 
process, I went home and 
searched “rushing,” “bidding” 
and things of this nature for 
other forms of Greek life on 
the Internet. This means that, 
though it was outside of the 
bubble I know of Greek life, 
I was willing to respect and 
acknowledge its other forms 
and 
variations, 
ultimately 

educating myself.

In one simple statement, I 

am able to include all, so that 
there are no misrepresented 
groups. I say this because 
I think it would have been 
simple enough for news outlets 
or students speaking out on 
Twitter to be conscious enough 
to do the same.

BLEECKER STREET

Silly film starring a schizophrenic Dickens
‘The Man Who Invented 
Christmas’ lively & fresh

The latest Scrooge story rings in a season of holiday movies

“A Christmas Carol” is one of 

those stories that has been told 
and told again year after year 
to the point that it’s hard for 
any new adaptation to do much 
more than retread the same 
material. That’s not necessarily 
a detriment to those retellings; 
it’s just the nature of bringing to 
the big screen a story that all but 
reinvented the way Christmas is 
celebrated. Audiences know what 
to expect. Ebenezer Scrooge is a 
miser. He is visited on Christmas 
Eve by three ghosts who force 
him to change his ways. He 
becomes a better person. God 
bless us every one.

Because of the potential for 

repetition, it’s to the utmost 
credit of Bharat Nalluri’s (“MI-
5”) new film “The Man Who 
Invented Christmas” that it has 
found a new way to examine the 
story of “A Christmas Story” by 
looking at the story of its creation. 
Instead of Scrooge becoming a 
more kind-hearted person, we 
watch as author Charles Dickens 
(Dan Stevens, “Legion”) must 
confront his resentful feelings 
toward his father for a childhood 
that saw him employed at a work 
house. Instead of just the Ghosts 
of Christmases Past, Present and 
Future, Dickens plays host to the 
entire cast of the novella. Instead 
of the same story repackaged 
with different faces, the film has 
the appeal of something entirely 
new.

At the center of the film is 

Stevens as Dickens, with the 
actor once more proving himself 
to be one of the most versatile 
performers at work today. Ably 
switching between the mania of 
a writer consumed by his craft 
and the turmoil underneath, it’s 
a dynamic performance through 
which Stevens commands the 
screen. The role of Dickens’s 
mental projection of Scrooge goes 
to Christopher Plummer (“The 
Exception”), who is given the 
opportunity to not only recreate 
the most iconic moments of “A 

Christmas Carol” but to approach 
them from the different angle 
allowed by the film’s unique spin 
on the material. The veteran 
actor proves more than up to the 
challenge, and his portrayal of 
the legendary character is one for 
the books.

And 
ultimately, 
much 
of 

what “The Man Who Invented 
Christmas” does so well comes 
down to the way it broaches the 
material. We know the steps 
Scrooge’s redemption will follow, 
but watching it be informed by 
and contrasted with Dickens’s 
struggles lends them new weight. 

The emotional climax is a truly 
fantastic repurposing of the 
Christmas Future scenes that 
puts a lovely bow on both stories, 
and while the dialogue doesn’t 
always sing as well as writer 
Susan Coyne (“Mozart in the 
Jungle”) seems to think it does 
— there are moments that seem 
to have been scripted specifically 
to provide “trailer lines” — 
there’s a certain joy to be found 
in 
watching 
Dickens 
banter 

with some of his most famous 
characters.

With that being said, it’s 

impossible to deny that the image 
of Dickens consulting literal 
manifestations 
of 
Ebenezer 

Scrooge and his fellow characters 
is just the least bit silly. Nalluri 
and Stevens handle it well enough 
by lending these moments an 
almost dreamlike quality in both 
visuals and performance, but 
Dickens, as he’s portrayed here, 
is borderline schizophrenic. He 
seems to be one superpowered 
alter-ego from turning into The 
Beast from “Split.”

It’s easy to take the silliness 

in stride once one considers 
that “The Man Who Invented 
Christmas” is currently the best 
Christmas 
movie 
playing 
in 

theaters. It embodies the spirit 
of the season and of Dickens’s 
work in a novel way that will 
likely please fans of “A Christmas 
Carol” and those who, like me, 
know it more for the Muppets’ 
take 
on 
the 
material 
than 

anything else. It’s doubtlessly 
absurd, but in a way, even that 
serves to buoy its charm and 
spirit.

NETFLIX

Thi is a Netflix picture but we’re talking about her Hulu show just so you know
Reckoning with the art of 
problematic once-heroes

How do we proceed in the face of the art versus artist debate?

“Can you love someone who 

did bad things?”

This is the question posed 

by comedian Sarah Silverman 
during the cold open of her Hulu 
show, “I Love You, America.” 
Silverman’s 
monologue 
was 

dedicated to comments on the 
recent revelations against her 
close friend and fellow comedian 
Louis C.K., who was accused 
by five women of masturbating 
in front of them without their 
consent. The comedian later 
admitted that these accusations 
were true saying, “I have spent 
my long and lucky career talking 
and saying anything I want. I 
will now step back and take a 
long time to listen.”

Silverman and C.K. have 

been friends for decades, and 
Silverman was a frequent guest 
on C.K.’s FX show, “Louie.” 
Her comments on his sexual 
misconduct 
were 
highly 

anticipated and much-needed, 
as she has been very public about 
both her support of feminism 
and her friendship with C.K. 
Though visibly upset, Silverman 
emphasized 
the 
importance 

of 
the 
recent 
barrage 
of 

sexual assault allegations in 
Hollywood, comparing it to 
tumors being removed. “Some of 
our heroes will be taken down,” 
she said, “and we will discover 
bad things about people we 
like or in some cases, people we 
love.”

As our idols and role models 

begin to deal with the fact that 
many of their colleagues and 

friends 
are 
less-than-moral 

people, we must also face our 
own reality. Even if you were 
never a fan of somebody who 
has been accused of sexual 
misconduct or any other type 
of abuse, what if tomorrow it is 
your hero’s face splashed across 
the front page of the New York 
Times? How will you react? 
Can you be a fan of something 
created by someone so horrible? 
Is it possible to separate the 
art from the artist? Can you 
still love someone who did bad 
things?

I wish there were simple 

answers to these questions. I 
wish that good and bad was as 
easy as black and white, and 
that there would be no gray 
area in between. Most of all, I 
wish that men and women alike 
would stop using their positions 
to take advantage of people 
desperate for their careers to 
take off. Unfortunately, we are 
living in an unkind world, and 
these difficult questions must 
be managed or else they will 
continue to persist.

I 
have 
no 
emotional 

connection to Louis C.K.. Nor 
did I to Harvey Weinstein, 
Charlie 
Rose, 
Nick 
Carter, 

Kevin Spacey or any of the 
other countless men accused of 
sexual misconduct. From the 
outside, it is easy to immediately 
discredit those who try and 
stand by these people. What 
they did is horrible, yes, and 
there is absolutely no excuse for 
their vile behavior. But I cannot 
shake the nagging feeling that 
soon enough, somebody that I 
have loved and admired will be 
the next one exposed. I imagine 

feeling 
sad, 
disappointed, 

even betrayed, but I cannot 
honestly say that I would exile 
this person, or the things they 
created, completely from my 
life.

It is hard to separate art from 

the artist when you know that a 
show or song or joke came from 
the the same mind that made 
the decision to harm another 
person or make derogatory 
comments. It is even harder to 
appreciate a piece of art when, 
in the back of your head, you 
know that someone else will 
look at that same thing and be 
struck with fear and trauma 
from what happened to them. 
We don’t have to feel guilty 
or shameful, we don’t have to 
force ourselves to stop liking the 
art that these people created, 
but what we do have to do is 
condemn 
their 
actions 
and 

refrain from making excuses. It 
hurts to see your heroes fall, but 
it hurts even more to be a victim 
of harassment or abuse and see 
people try and discredit your 
feelings just because the person 
who harmed you makes them 
laugh.

As Silverman noted in her 

monologue, this moment in time 
is vital not just for Hollywood, 
but for a world that too often 
allows for misconduct to be 
swept under the carpet. We 
have to expect more from the 
people we idolize and move 
towards a culture that does not 
allow them to use their status 
to exploit those under them. 
Until that happens, believe the 
victims, denounce the offenders 
and try to keep faith that we as 
a society will one day be better.

What does activism 

mean to us?

How do we define activism?
I ask not because I have an 

answer or even the slightest 
idea of how to answer such a 
question.

I 
ask 
simply 
because 
it 

matters.

One of the most amazing 

aspects of this University is that 
it provides the opportunity for us 
to immerse ourselves in all that 
it offers, particularly in using 
our collective power to seek 
change and work with others to 
achieve a number of goals. It is a 
forum that includes circulating 
ideas, varying experiences and 
incredible perspectives. Some 
students on this campus demand 
we look at our communities and 
encourage 
political 
change. 

Others admit they are not as 
passionate about politics, but 
incredibly committed to social 
reform and equality among the 
student body and beyond our 

campus. Some disregard such 
distinctions and simply view 
change as change.

I’m 
perplexed 
at 
how 

complicated 
it 
is 
to 
fully 

understand 
how 
we 
view 

activism in our society. I find 
it absolutely outrageous when 
I see some people who are so 
outwardly vocal about what 
they cannot stand: this political 
leader, 
that 
professor, 
that 

campus organization or that 
classmate, but yet, they are the 
same people who sit on their 
couch and expect the problems 
that they have identified to 
eventually go away. They raise 
a hand in class to share their 
two cents about the problems 
around them, yet nothing in 
their everyday life seems to be 
adjusted or sacrificed in order 
to create the change they wish 
to see.

May I add that change does 

not happen in the form of a long 
Facebook post, where you can 
hide behind a screen and outline 
what you believe are the major 
injustices of this world. 
Once you feel you have 
properly voiced them, 
you sign off, close your 
screen 
and 
resume 

your 
comfortable 

lifestyle of observing 
what you feel is wrong 
from the outside. Your 
“activism” 
doesn’t 

leave your front door.

Some people believe 

that change will come 
when they dehumanize 
those who oppose them. Their 
voices can be heard loud enough 
and clear enough, as long as they 
have properly silenced those on 
the other side.

My idea of activism is rooted 

in what I’m sincerely passionate 
about. I want to devote my career

to working in education reform 
and finding ways to provide 
opportunities for students who 
are academically capable, but 
are not provided the proper 
resources and preparation to be 
able to access quality education. I 
have found ways to give my time 
to campus organizations and 
nonprofit organizations that are 
oriented around similar goals. 
Therefore, I believe my activism 
is the process of devoting myself 
to the issues I feel I am most 
capable of solving.

Activism, 
seeking 
justice, 

achieving equality — however 

we choose to define 
this topic — reveal the 
inherently 
personal 

nature 
in 
activism 

that I feel our campus 
often 
overlooks. 

One 
person’s 
way 

of 
seeking 
change, 

like participating in 
a protest, may prove 
completely ineffective 
for someone else. Not 
for the purpose of 
why there is a protest, 

but simply what it asks of its 
members. You cannot adequately 
participate in a movement in 
which you don’t feel you can 
positively contribute. What I have 
defined as the “personal nature” 
to activism is the individualistic 
side of change, which is derived 

from a personal evaluation of 
what matters most to you. We 
all have our own strengths and 
abilities. I believe we should put 
these assets towards our existing 
systems — we enter, disrupt what 
exists and attempt to restructure 
what is there in a better way.

This past Monday at Hill 

Auditorium, 
I 
attended 

Congressman 
John 
Lewis’s 

keynote lecture, and one student 
asked a question regarding the 
idea of “levels” of activism, that 
is, some believe certain forms 
of activism are more powerful 
or worthy than others. She 
is a student in the School of 
Education, and she wanted to 
know how we can coordinate 
our 
various 
understandings 

of activism and allow these 
movements 
to 
work 
in 

conjunction with one another, 
particularly through how we 
educate one another. I have often 
felt like this campus glorifies 
a certain type of activist, the 
loudest ones in the room, while 
others who are involved with 
equally important movements 
are seen as complacent or not as 
influential.

This 
idea 
of 
“hierarchal” 

activism, which Nate Powell 
addressed in the lecture, raises 
questions of how educators and 
influencers can promote activism 
without suggesting there is one 

way to do it. When we operate 
under this “top-down” mindset, 
we tend to believe that politicians 
or other elected officials are the 
members of society most able to 
influence. In some ways, they can 
influence and promote change 
in ways that are inaccessible 
to others. However, the depth 
to which they contribute does 
not 
necessarily 
vary 
much 

from those in government to 
students on a campus who want 
reform. How can members of 
a 
community 
like 
teachers, 

politicians, students or parents 
feel they are active in change, 
though they approach it in 
different ways? More generally, 
how do we recognize and reward 
such differences?

Congressman 
Lewis 
spoke 

powerful and encouraging words 
to all of us gathered in Hill. He 
urged us to go after what we 
see that is not right and speak 
up. Activism is not defined 
one way and similarly, cannot 
be conducted in just one way. 
It is to be stretched, changed 
and designed by our unique 
passions and what we believe 
must be altered within our 
society. In a world that demands 
improvement, it is essential we 
realize what the path to change 
looks like — considering what 
surrounds it, and those that we 
encourage to walk along it.

INTERSCOPE

Mura Masa performed in Detroit the Friday before Thanksgiving
Mura Masa’s meticulous 
magic stuns at Majestic

British DJ brought mellowness and majesty to the Detroit venue

There’s a fine line between 

concerts and listening parties. 
Both involve listening to an 
artist’s music with a large 
group of people; you can dance 
at both, you can sing along 
at both. The artist is often 
times in attendance at both 
(less frequently for the latter). 
Both are even rather tightly 
produced — concerts may seem 
more freeform than playing a 
recording, but often times they 
too are planned with immense 
detail.

So how are they different? 

In concerts we get an insight 
into the person behind the 
artist enigma. We see them in 
their music-making element 
and, from this, draw evidence 
to piece together who they are 
and what they are like.

This 
was 
on 
display 
at 

Detroit’s The Majestic, where 
21 year-old British DJ Alex 
Crossan 
(known 
best 
by 

his stage name Mura Masa) 
exhibited 
a 
rather 
mellow 

presence; however, he didn’t 
come across as disinterested 
or bored, but rather highly 
focused and detail-oriented. 
The stage was set with a 
laptop, multiple drums sets, 
microphones, keyboards and 
a guitar. He shifted through 
instruments, 
demonstrating 

the breadth of his talent and 
adding layers to his intricate 
tracks.

Mura Masa rarely showed 

emotion; he broke from the flow 
of his set only briefly to check 
in on the crowd with a “How 
are you doing, Detroit?” Yet 
this lack of animation appeared 
a necessary side effect of the 
DJ’s sharp concentration on 
delivering really spectacular 
music. 
The 
music 
most 

definitely took focus.

However, 
the 
action 
on 

stage was far from dull. On 
featureless tracks or tracks 
that Crossan chose to lend 
vocals to, the producer held 
the crowd’s attention as if 
caught in a trance. I stood 
in awe of a person my own 
age single-handedly creating 
such complex music. Many 
of his most popular tracks 
have guest features. Rather 
than playing recordings, he 
was accompanied by British 
vocalist Fliss who flexed her 
versatility, singing and rapping 
tracks originally delivered by 
artists ranging from NAO to 
Charli XCX. Her performance 
of mainstream breakout single 
“Love$ick” rivaled the A$AP 
Rocky 
original. 
Given 
her 

energetic presence, she also 
seemed to double as a hype 
woman, dancing around the 
stage and calling for the room 
to dance with her.

No number of shiny features 

could dampen Mura Masa’s 
demanding presence though. 
There were plenty of beats-
only 
breaks 
throughout 

the night that allowed the 
DJ’s 
production 
abilities 

to take center stage. Even 
during the features, he lent 
an anchoring quality to the 
show — everything played was 
produced by him which made 
for a cohesive concert.

Throughout the show, my 

hope that we would catch the 
DJ in a less serious moment 
slowly diminished — he seemed 
keen on preserving his intense 
focus. Finally, during the first 
song of the encore, the shell 
showed a crack. The DJ called 
his girlfriend in the midst of a 
solo rendition of “Blu” and left 
the whole crowd standing on 
their toes, trying to read his 
lips as he spoke to her. I guess 
we all wanted to understand 
what it’s like to be friends with 
Alex Crossan.

Given the lack animation 

from the headline artist, the 
show had the potential to 
resemble a listening party, 
rather that a concert. However, 
Mura Masa’s stoic presence 
gave the audience an equally 
rich understanding of who Alex 
Crossan is. We learned this 
young producer is immensely 
talented, meticulously detail-
oriented and not afraid to show 
he’s having fun every once in a 
while.

I love you. You’re 

slouching.

The universality of ‘Lady Bird’’s mother/daughter relationship

“Lady Bird” is now the highest- 

rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. 
Ever. It’s also quite possibly the 
most wonderful movie. Ever. But 
universal acclaim hasn’t saved 
Greta Gerwig’s masterpiece from a 
serving of hot (and very bad) takes.

Recently, an article popped up 

on my Twitter: “’Lady Bird’ and 
Cycles of Abuse,” in which the 
writer poses an argument that 
“Lady Bird” is not a careful portrait 
of the complexities of a mother-
daughter relationship, but in fact a 
story about maternal abuse.

This is, of course, wrong. And I 

won’t dedicate much more space 
to the ways in which someone 
named “Jim” missed the nuances 
and complexities of the mother-
daughter relationship in “Lady 
Bird” (except to say that he missed 
them all). But his misstep did get 
me thinking about everything 
“Lady Bird” gets right.

Gerwig gets all the details 

of 
semi-suburban 
adolescence 

correct: the defiant rejection of 
Catholic 
school 
communion, 

the popular girl’s Range Rover, 
the 
sensitive 
(and 
closeted) 

heartthrob’s puka shell necklace. 
Justin Timberlake plays at a party 
where the parents are upstairs, but 
“they don’t care if we drink.”

All those little, carefully chosen 

details create a world that is both 
factually and emotionally real. The 
emotional reality comes from the 
delicacy and honesty with which 
Gerwig handles her character’s 
relationships.

There is no “good” and “bad” in 

“Lady Bird.” We don’t want Lady 
Bird to win against (or despite of) 
her mother or Danny or even Kyle 
or Jenna. Because none of those 
characters, though they make life 
harder for our heroine, are bad. 
And even Lady Bird can fluctuate 
between cruelty and compassion, 
often within the same scene.

Lady 
Bird 
and 
Marion’s 

relationship is built on this duality. 
In one scene, Lady Bird can grab a 
notepad and demand her mother 
tell her how much it costs to raise 
her so she can one day pay her back 
and “never have to see her again,” 
and in another see Marion pick up 

that same pad and struggle to write 
a letter to her daughter as she gets 
ready to leave for college.

And we can understand that 

those actions are both attempts 
at the impossible but inevitable 
process of separation. Lady Bird 
will leave Marion, and sometime in 
the distant but approaching future, 
Marion will leave Lady Bird. And 
neither one of them can be ready 
for either departure.

Before Lady Bird leaves, Marion 

scrambles to prepare her for the 
unknowable beast that is the world 
outside her home. And through 
that rushed preparation, “You’re 
dragging your feet” becomes a 
different way of saying “I love you.”

That moment — which comes 

up twice during the course of the 
film — as the two shop for dresses, 

is one of the most obviously 
recognizable for any mother or 
daughter. I went to prom in 2015 
as opposed to 2002, so after my 
mom and I fought in a department 
store I went home and bought my 
dress online. That act — choosing a 
dress without my mom — is in the 
same family as Lady Bird choosing 
to go to Danny’s Thanksgiving 
or hiding her college process 
from her mother. It’s a conscious 
act of exclusion that serves as 
preparation for a time in the near 
future when that type of inclusion 
won’t always be an option.

Lady Bird and her mother spend 

the movie creating space between 
each other. They push each other 
away, but they rarely — save Lady 
Bird’s dramatic exit in the first 
scene — try to escape each other. 
They fight, but stay in the same 
room after.

That’s why Marion’s silence 

isn’t abusive and her criticism isn’t 
cruel. It must be a complicated 
brand of love to prepare your 
child to leave you. Marion wants 
Lady Bird to be the best version of 
herself she can be so she tells her 
to stand up straight and hang up 
her uniform and apply to in-state 
colleges.

What it takes for Marion’s wish 

to be fulfilled is for Lady Bird to fly 
the nest.

I talk about my mother now in 

a way my 18 or even 20-year-old 
self could never imagine. With 
a kind of love and reverence and 
frequency that I didn’t realize was 
in such opposition to the way I 
used to talk about her until I saw 
the movie.

I talk about her the way Lady 

Bird starts to at the end of the 
film. She spends the film rejecting 
everything her mother has given 
her—her name, her hair color—and 
then finally, miles away from her 
mother, she starts taking them 
back.

And that concession of guilt, 

that apology, is an impossible one 
to articulate. So, when she calls 
Marion at the end of the film 
all she can say is: “Did you get 
emotional the first time you drove 
in Sacramento?”

And we get it. That in itself is a 

kind of apology for a kind of cruelty 
that doesn’t always warrant one. 
It’s a reconnection that tries to do 
yet another impossible thing: make 
up for lost time.

Now, older and wiser, I look 

back on the anger my high school 
self spit at my mother and I regret 
it. I regret all the hours of silence 
and fights in the car and times I 
slammed my door. But I know I 
couldn’t change it.

The stage after teen angst 

doesn’t 
have 
a 
good 
name. 

Existential dread, maybe? My 
twenties? Whatever this thing is 
called, I’m in it. And, at the end of 
the movie, “Lady Bird” is entering 
it. Picking up the pieces of the 
things our mothers gave us that we 
threw away and trying to say sorry, 
without being able — of course — to 
actually say it.

CONCERT REVIEW

ABSO LUTELY PRODUCTIONS

Tim and Eric star in “Tim and Eric Awesome Show”
Lasting influence of Tim 
and Eric’s comedy empire

How the duo created a legacy with Abso Lutely Productions

I was just a pimply teenage 

boy learning to cope with my 
abundant awkwardness when 
I first stumbled upon “Tim and 
Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!.” 
It was a beam of godly sunshine, 

the entertainment I needed to 
feel like my freakish sense of 
humor was actually shared with 
others equally strange. Since 
then, Tim Heidecker (“Fantastic 
Four”) 
and 
Eric 
Wareheim 

(“Master of None”) have spread 
their unique brand of humor to 
create a comedy empire.

Abso 
Lutely, 
the 
duo’s 

production 
company 
formed 

in 2007, produces some of the 
funniest shows on TV today, 
all embodying the Tim and 
Eric 
spirit. 
Describing 
this 

spirit, however, is like enduring 
a 
painstakingly 
awkward 

interaction with a stranger; we 
can’t say why, but it leaves us 
feeling uneasy. With “The Eric 

Andre Show” and “Nathan for 
You,” two increasingly popular 
and acclaimed shows, Abso Lutely 
Productions has become one of 
the most influential production 
companies in comedy.

Tim and Eric, though, were 

anything but overnight stars. After 
meeting at Temple University, the 
two have worked together since, 
first creating the animated Adult 
Swim series “Tom Goes to the 
Mayor.” The show began as an 
internet web series before Bob 
Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) 
found it, immediately noticing 
their brilliance. Eclectic and 
absurd, “Tom Goes to the Mayor” 
laid the roots for what would 
eventually become “Tim and Eric 
Awesome Show, Great Job!,” the 
duo’s creative highpoint.

“Awesome Show” takes over 

where 
Odenkirk 
and 
David 

Cross’s (“Arrested Development”) 
90s sketch comedy series “Mr. 
Show” left off. Each episode 
begins with the duo, generally 
dressed 
in 
frumpy 
outfits, 

scheming or bickering and varies 
from playing a million-dollar 
tennis match to recovering a lost 
testicle from Eric’s stomach. But 
what makes this show unique 
is its sketches, often featuring 
an equally hilarious actor or 
comedian. It’s shocking to see 
the plethora of talent — Zach 
Galifianakis 
(“Lego 
Batman 

Movie”), Will Ferrell (“Daddy’s 
Home 2”) and Maria Bamford 
(“Lady Dynamite”) to name a few 
— always in vulnerable situations, 
perfectly matching Tim and Eric’s 
cringe-inducing style.

The show’s most well-known 

recurring character Dr. Steve 
Brule, effortlessly played by John 
C. Reilly (“Kong: Skull Island”), 
gives 
viewers 
important 
life 

advice and even earned a spin-off 
series, “Check It Out! With Dr. 
Steve Brule.” A valuable addition 
to the Abso Lutely catalog, “Check 
It Out” rivals its predecessor in 
hilarity and ventures into even 

darker territory. Throughout the 
series, Brule investigates no-frill 
locations and interviews various 
professionals. 
Dangerously 

addicting and relentlessly bizarre, 
“Check It Out” kept “Awesome 
Show”’s legacy alive in full form.

Later in 2012, Tim and Eric 

produced 
“The 
Eric 
Andre 

Show,” a spoof of late night talk-
shows. Unlike “Awesome Show,” 
the show has reached a wider 
audience thanks to its long list of 

celebrity interviews, like Tyler 
the Creator (“Loiter Squad”), 
T.I. and Jack Black. It’s in the 
same vein as “Awesome Show,” 
with a greater emphasis on 
shock humor in its on-the-street 
skits, showing Eric Andre in 
ridiculous situations. The show’s 
mellow co-host Hannibal Buress 
(“Spiderman: Homecoming”) is 
responsible for an almost equal 
amount of laughs as Andre, acting 
as the ideal foil to the host’s 
energetic, rambunctious attitude 
and unpredictability. “The Eric 
Andre Show” is an extension of 
Tim and Eric’s comedic vision 
but at a higher octane; the result 
is a frenetic, hysterical show, one I 
would consider to be the funniest 
of today.

“Nathan for You” is the least 

obnoxious 
yet 
wittiest 
show 

produced by Abso Lutely. Nathan 
Fielder 
stars 
as 
a 
business 

consultant who gives advice to 
struggling small businesses on 
how to succeed. Abandoning 
the more explicitly in-your-face 
surreal tinge of the other shows, 
“Nathan for You” is the holy 
grail of awkward, cringe-worthy 
humor. It’s also the most easily 
accessible of the bunch, but this 
isn’t necessarily saying a whole 
lot.

Abso 
Lutely 
Productions 

practically 
transformed 

awkwardness into a form of art. 
With their signature transitions, 
nihilistic outlook and admiration 
for all things surreal, Tim and 
Eric created their own watermark 
of sorts, a clear style unparalleled 
by anyone else.

Let’s talk about it: What it means to keep walking

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 29, 2017

PHOTO COURTESY OF RABAB JAFRI

“

Passengers please prepare for landing.”

I hold onto my seat and look out the window. 

My stomach jumps as the plane hits the ground 
and I closed my eyes to feel the earth beneath 

me.

“Allahuma sali a’la Muhammad wa ale Muhammad” — 

peace and blessings be upon Muhammad and the family 
of Muhammad, the passengers on my 
flight landing in Najaf, Iraq, collectively 
voiced prayer. On this plane, I was not an 
outsider. Nobody glared at me as I walked 
down the aisle, silently wishing that my 
seat was not next to theirs.

I think about my reasoning, my state 

of mind undertaking this journey as I bid 
farewell and walk toward the crowds of 
the largest annual gathering in the world. 
My yearning to begin sets in as I join the 
14 million pilgrims determined to walk 50 
miles to reach the holy city of Karbala.

Everyone was walking for the same 

purpose: to commemorate the struggle of 
the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad 
(peace be upon him), Imam Hussain 
(alayhi as-salam).

The struggle of Imam Hussain is one 

that speaks to each person making this 
journey, and so many more around the 
world. He stood against the tyrant Yazid, 
refusing to give his allegiance and accept 
him as the leader. In response, Yazid’s 
army of 30,000 killed Imam Hussain and 
his 72 companions on the desert plains of Karbala over 
1,400 years ago. Yazid cut off water from Imam Hussain’s 
army and family, including women and children, for three 
days. After Imam Hussain and his army were killed, the 
women and children were taken captive until they were 
finally set free to bury their loved ones. This return to 
Karbala is called Arbaeen, the Arabic word for 40, as it 
was 40 days after the initial battle. This commemoration 
is sacred to Shia Muslims, the smaller of the two main 
sects of Islam — although Sunni Muslims also respect 
Imam Hussain.

I started my journey at dawn and felt the Iraqi sun rise 

overhead. I watched the people around me; some were 
not wearing shoes, or carrying simple string backpacks, 
or setting out to walk with only the clothes on their back. 
I saw an old, blind man walk down the long stretch of 
road on his own, only his guiding stick as company. I 
thought about how much I was carrying on my back, and 
the shoes on my feet as reminders of what I have and 

what acts as a distraction to me. I saw parents pushing 
children in strollers, and children pushing parents in 
wheelchairs.

With each step I took on this dusty, uneven road, I 

tried to remember my destination, and look up to the flag 
people waving around around me with the words “Ya 
Hussain” — “Oh Hussain” — written on them. Walking 

continually for multiple hours, I remembered how Imam 
Hussain walked back and forth unsure of how he would 
tell his wife, Rabab, that when he asked the opposing 
army to give his 6-month-old son water, they shot an 
arrow through his throat. I remembered the heat of the 
sun on the day of Ashura — the day of the battle — and 
the thirst of the army, women and children. I remembered 
each story that I’ve heard told from the halls of my mosque, 
year after year, the grief still fresh.

I walked, and remembered. And so I ensure no one 

forgets, I kept walking.

The strength of the people I saw around me gave me 

more determination. Every time someone in my small group 
became tired, I walked with them and listened to the poetic 
retelling the stories of Karbala, for the journey is both 
collective and individual. When walking became difficult for 
me, people did the same. I started to realize my potential to 
do good was greater than what I had originally understood 
it to be. This journey rejuvenates my understanding of what 

it means to struggle in the way of God.

Above all, it is the generosity of the Iraqi people that 

astounds me most. Every year, Iraqis who live a life of simple 
means save money to help serve every pilgrim who walks.

As I walked, every necessity was provided for me. 

People stand in the middle of the road, carrying plates of 
food, bottles of water, bread and tea. Children as young 

as two stood, poured water, sprayed 
perfume or handed tissues to pilgrims 
to practice this tradition of generosity. 
Massaging the feet of tired pilgrims 
gives them pleasure, as they know 
and understand the love that makes 
you walk for almost three days. No 
one expects anything in return.

People opened their homes or 

“Mawkibs,” places built for pilgrims 
to rest or stay the night. They stopped 
to ask me where I traveled from, and 
are surprised to learn I came from 
America. They ask me how long it 
took me to reach, as many of them 
came from Iran or other Iraqi cities.

They ask me what it’s like to be a 

Muslim in America.

I return to this question as I return 

to my regular school routine. This 
journey that I long to take every year 
is unknown to most, as is the story 
behind it. And as many people asked 
me why I was spending a week in Iraq 
during the school year when I have no 

family there, I could not find the words to explain what it 
means to me. It is seldom spoken about in comparison to 
the narratives of hypocrites in the media, who use Islam 
as justification for their actions put on the forefront, just 
as Yazid and his follower. This is the picture of Islam I’m 
often painted with, and as I have already felt this since I 
have been back, as I am starting to enter the workforce.

For me, the walk this year was especially astonishing, 

as it was only seven months ago that I was too ill to come 
to school. To look back at how life has changed in such 
a short time feels unreal. Now, every new challenge 
I face feels like the walk. Every time I feel a situation 
is impossible, I remind myself that there were times 
during the walk that felt impossible to me as well, but 
my potential is so much greater than what I credit myself 
with. I remember the generosity of the Iraqi people and 
the simplicity of those around me, all centered around 
one goal.

I remember what it means to keep walking.

Soundtracking: Scheduling

I

t’s the most wonderful time of the year …

I’m sitting on my laptop, physically drowning 

in papers and assignments, when an email 
notification pops up on my phone — not that I 

was on my phone instead of doing homework or anything 
but this is a judgement-free zone so get off my back. I 
swipe down to check out what all the fuss is about in my 
inbox. That’s when I see her …

The most beautiful sight I 

have ever witnessed. I fell to 
my knees. Tears welled up in 
my eyes. I finally felt some 
warmth in my body that has 
been oh so cold for so many 
years.

Seven words, four numbers, 

26 letters.

“Winter 2018 Course Guide 

is now live!”

Nothing Can Change This 

Love — Sam Cooke

Scheduling is the only thing 

I look forward to all semester. 
I 
understand 
the 
irony 

because I said the same thing 
last semester and the classes 
the course guide gave me for 
fall 2017 have been sucker-
punching me in the gut and 
spitting on my writhing body 
for the past 12 weeks but I 
stand by my opinion. The 
course guide launching is 
like Christmas or Hanukkah 
or 
any 
denominational 

celebration that takes place 
in the winter months. Think 
about it. You don’t know what 
you’re gonna get, some gifts 
are better than others and 
making your wishlist is often 
more fun and rewarding than 
the gifts themselves.

I check my enrollment time 

— the ultimate decider that either lifts you to academic 
success and mental health or the final nail in your coffin.

“December 4th, 12:45 pm”
Not bad. I text my friends to check if I’m royally 

screwed or if I’m in good shape. They respond:

“December 4th, 1:00 pm”
They Won’t Go When I Go — Stevie Wonder
I’m safe. I throw all my other homework aside (as if 

I were emotionally invested in it in the first place) and 
dive head-first into the course guide. Who would have 
thought I was diving into the equivalent of a kiddie pool 
with a concrete bottom?

Balancing my major, my minor, the LSA requirements, 

academic interests, personal interests, credit load and 
sanity is not an easy task. Three hours fly by before you 
can say, “Hey, Matt, maybe you should focus on your 
assignment due tomorrow instead of scheduling for 
classes like a dipshit,” and I finally have one schedule 
option that fits all my aforementioned categories. 
The golden schedule. The one true option. The highly 
coveted.

I have done the impossible.
A week goes by and my schedule still sits backpacked 

in Wolverine Access, right where it belongs. It awaits 
Dec. 4 so everything can be confirmed. I tuck in my 
schedule every night and sing it a lullaby so it knows 
how much I appreciate it. I don’t know why I checked 
but something told me I should explore the course guide 

some more. I go back to one of my classes and see the 
time of the class changed from 11-12 to 12-1.

Changes — Charles Bradley
One hour.
One hour has officially thrown a stone at the 

glass house that was my schedule. The new 12-1 class 
interferes with my second class, which, in turn, now 
interferes with my third class, which, you guessed it, 
jams a wrench into my schedule’s spokes and screws 
over my fourth class.

I sit, mouth agape, watching everything I loved and 

cherished in this world fall apart. I can’t blame myself. I 
won’t blame myself.

The course guide betrayed me.
Not My Baby — Alvvays
Why would the course guide do this to me? We 

had an agreement. I trusted the course guide and no 
consideration was given to how I might feel if a class 
was changed from 11-12. I have never felt this much pain 
in my entire life.

I login to my Backpack and stare at what could have 

been. I can’t look for too long unless I want to start 
crying like when I saw “Marley and Me” in theaters.

You can’t tell me you didn’t bawl like a damn baby 

when Owen Wilson buried that yellow Labrador 
retriever.

I select all the courses and press “Delete.” Along with 

my Backpack, my heart is empty.

Empty — Kevin Abstract
I walk with my head hung low back 

to the dorm to find all my friends who 
are 15 minutes after me for scheduling 
times. They knew. They knew something 
happened.

“Something wrong with your sched, 

Matt? Are you crying?”

No, my eyes are just watering. My 

face is sweaty. I just cut an onion.

I explain the situation and how I have 

to make a whole new schedule in a few 
days’ time. I may have broken down a 
few times in the process, but eventually 
I get the story out in full. Instead of 
consoling me and reminding me there 
are plenty of courses in the sea, all I get 
is a room full of friends laughing at my 
misfortune, telling me I’m up a creek 
without a paddle.

Thanks, guys.
Truth Hurts — Lizzo
I spend the next day and a half 

browsing the course guide once again. 
This time, I can only find classes that 
fit a few of my necessary categories. 
Maybe I want to take a class in my 
major, but it starts at 8:30 a.m. and I am 
not about that lifestyle or maybe this 
class sounds amazing but it interferes 
with a prior commitment. Suffice it to 
say, my friends were right. Turns out 
I was the one who was destined to be 
royally screwed.

While browsing my own personal 

hell that is now the course guide, I 
can barely keep from crying. My mind 

keeps wandering to how beautiful life was when I had a 
schedule and all was right in the world. Now, life is gray 
and my schedule has gone down the toilet.

Down — Jay Sean ft. Lil Wayne
I come to the realization that I did this to myself. I 

can’t mope and think the course guide was out to get 
me. I was the one who started scheduling before the 
class times were finalized. If I had waited, I might have 
been able to fix this and cause less pain. I might have 
been able to meet with an adviser and get, well, advised. 
They could have at least outlined my options instead 
of allowing me to flop around like a fish in the desert, 
gasping for breath and baking in the sun.

I’ve made my bed and now I must lie in it. Next 

semester, I solemnly swear not to start searching for 
classes until I am positive no switcheroos can ruin my 
life again.

Should Have Known Better — Sufjan Stevens
*Flash forward to next semester*
Ooh the course guide is out!

Changing the Script

Students of color break barriers in musical theater

by Tanya Madhani, Senior MiC Editor
W

ith the highly-antici-
pated opening of “Ham-
ilton: 
An 
American 

Musical” in the summer 

of 2015, it seemed as if Broadway — and 
theater as a whole — was taking the first 
step to combat the highly divisive and 
potent movement that has persevered in 
another section of the arts: #OscarsSoW-
hite. The hullabaloo and frenzy sur-
rounding the opening of the musical 
included a feature in Vogue magazine, 
shows selling out months in advance and 
scalpers asking for over $1,000 a ticket to 
the show.

Hamilton and its creator Lin-Manuel 

Miranda were lauded for their casting of 
non-white actors in traditionally white 
roles; Black, Asian and Hispanic actors 
played historical figures like George 
Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The 
initial casting call for the musical, which 
specifically requested actors of color, 
generated controversy over its alleged 
“reverse racism” toward white actors.

According to data collected by the 

Asian American Performers Action Coali-
tion, 70 percent of the actors in Broadway 
musicals running from 2014 to 2015 were 
white and 10.2 percent of actors were 
cast non-traditionally. Racial diversity in 
Broadway, despite Hamilton’s popularity, 
has a long way to go. 

The University of Michigan’s musical 

theater program, ranked one of the best 
in the country, trains students of diverse 
backgrounds to take on major roles 
in Broadway and off-Broadway shows 
across the country. The program recruits 
about 22 students annually from an 
applicant pool of over 1,000. I sat down 
with four students of color in the musical 
theater department to speak about their 
individual experiences both within the 
classroom and the industry about their 
identities.

*****
After competing in the prestigious 

National High School Musical Theatre 
Awards in New York City, Sam Hamashi-

ma, a School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior, knew he could do this for the rest 
of his life.

“I was so exhausted, but I really 

loved it. It was like finding that passion 
trumped the exhaustion. I also thought 
about how hectic it made my life feel. So, 
it’s definitely a job and it’s definitely an 
interest, but it’s a way of life too. It’s a 
lifestyle. Musical theater — it takes over 
your entire world.”

When the time came to apply to college, 

Hamashima — a musical theater major — 
wanted to highlight both his ethnicity 
and sexuality because they are central 
aspects of his identity. When auditioning 
for the University, he chose a song from 
the musical “Flower Drum Song,” and a 
monologue from the play “The Laramie 
Project.”

“Before I started applying, I had heard 

some things whispered about certain 
schools that was like: ‘They really like 
Asians there … they don’t take any Asians 
there you know,’” he said. “So, you kind 

of start to get the reputation of a school. 
For example, there were several schools 
on my list that I didn’t apply to primar-
ily because I looked at their student body 
and they didn’t have any representation.”

While the University has made strides 

to improve their diversity numbers, espe-
cially in the musical theater program, 
Hamashima said he still faces microag-
gressions that cast doubt over his future 
career on stage. In class Hamashima 
was once assigned to read the part of a 
character with an Italian accent. Shortly 
after attempting the part, his professor 
suggested he should read the passage 
by being “a little more accessible, like 
(doing) a Japanese accent.”

“Having my Japanese American iden-

tity, it’s just been a whirlwind for me,” 
he said. “Being looked at as Asian in the 
field, there are limitations. After [the 
incident], students came up to me and 
were like, ‘That was so crazy.’” 

Although he is biracial, Hamashima 

said he doesn’t have the option of pre-
senting himself as anything other than 
Asian due to his physical features. This 
constrains him when marketing him-
self for roles that call for certain casting 
types, ranging from the romantic lead to 
the sidekick.

“It’s frustrating and my journey is very 

different,” he said. “Especially now that 
I’m leaving school, I have to figure out 
not just what type am I, but also what 
type am I with the lens of my race, with 
the color of my skin, with the way that my 
face looks and the way my eyes are.”

His challenges in the musical theater 

field have not diminished his love for the 
stage and theater as an art form. After 
graduating in April, Hamashima plans 
to move to New York City and start audi-
tioning for shows.

“To be honest with you, when you are 

auditioning for anything, the hard part 
of this career is that there’s nothing 
stable,” he said. “If the show opens and 
closes then you have to find another job. 
You know, we switch employers so many 
times a year based on what show we’re 
with.”

*****
For most of the roles Music, Theatre 

& Dance junior Rohit Gopal has been 
offered — varying from television scripts 
to Screen Arts and Culture department 
projects — the American-born musical 
theater student has had to use a South 

Asian accent.

“Everything that I’ve submitted for 

that hasn’t been a commercial or for print 
work has been an Indian guy with an 
accent,” he said. “I don’t like it.”

When he gets a script for a comedy, 

Gopal said he first reads the lines with-
out an accent to make sure that the dia-
logue is funny regardless of whether or 
not he imitates a South Asian person. He 
does this, he said, to make sure the com-
edy is in the writing rather than in the 
character’s ethnicity. Sometimes, that’s 
not the case.

“Reading these lines, there’s noth-

ing inherently funny about the situation 
other than it’s funny to hear the Indian 
guy say bootylicious,” Gopal said. 

When asked if his identity as an Indian 

man is something that often plays into 
his interpretation of a role, Gopal paused 
to think before answering.

“I’m very, very underrepresented. I’m 

in a very underrepresented group … in 
musical theater in particular,” he said. 
“In music or musical theater, where there 
are very few Western musicals that are 
written about that are Indian or an Indi-
an person’s story … I don’t aim to be rep-
resented in that way.”

Gopal names comedian and actor Aziz 

Ansari and his hit Netflix series “Mas-
ter of None” as an example of how the 
landscape of Hollywood is changing to 
include more roles for those of his eth-
nicity.

“Aziz Ansari is a person who made his 

own work, and that is what I feel like I 
can do,” Gopal said. “I need to lead myself 
to a work that is a picture of what modern 
inclusivity really is.”

Nonetheless, Gopal has faced other 

obstacles in pursuing his passion for the 
arts. When he expressed a desire to major 
in musical theater to his parents during 
his final years of high school, he was ini-
tially met with resistance and concern.

“My parents and myself were very 

convinced that it was not going to be 
successful,” he said. “There’s very little 
possibility going into this field and my 
parents are very academic. So was my 
brother and I’m not so much in that way.”

However, when he was admitted to the 

School of Music, Theatre & Dance, Gopal 
knew none of his other college applica-
tions for academic majors would matter 
to him.

“Here was my second acceptance and 

it was also my top choice at this program, 
because I love the University,” he said.

Music, Theatre & Dance senior Nkeki 

Obi-Melekwe was fresh off of the new 
department-presented 
musical 
“One-

Hit Wonder” when she sat down for an 
interview with The Michigan Daily. Her 
experience being in the musical was 
rewarding — as has been the case with 
much of her time in the department — but 
she was appalled to find that callbacks 
for the lead roles in the program were 
whittled down to three pairs of white 
men and women.

“How is it that, out of all the talented 

amazing passionate people of color in this 
department, not one person fits either of 
those two roles?” she said. “That makes 
sense? That makes no sense. I talked 
to the head of our department and the 
music supervisor who was on faculty in 
the department separately. I told them 

my concern and I 
was like, ‘It is 2017. 
You guys have a 
new work on your 
hands and you’re 
the best musical 
theater school in 
the country. This 
cannot be white-
centric.’ ”

In an industry 

struggling 
with 

issues of inclusiv-
ity, 
Obi-Melekwe 

said it is hard not 
to 
come 
across 

roles that are ste-
reotypical 
por-

trayals 
of 
Black 

women.

“They have this 

idea of what the 
Black woman is; 
sassy and brassy 
and 
bold,” 
she 

said. 
“A 
lot 
of 

times 
that’s 
the 

box they’re put-
ting you in. Yes, 
I’m Black and I’m 
a woman, but I’m 
also a person that 

feels how anybody else would 
feel. Recently, like within the 
past year or so, the narra-
tive has begun to shift where 
people of color can be seen in 
roles with emotion and depth 
and they can fall in love and 
in a way that isn’t tragic.”

Like Gopal, when it comes 

to facing obstacles in the 
industry, Obi-Melekwe’s first 
challenge was convincing her 
parents and reconciling her 
identity as a first-generation 
American. Though they were 
aware of Obi-Melekwe’s love 
for singing and dancing, they 
initially dismissed it as a 
hobby and encouraged her, 
instead, to devote her time to 
more academic pursuits.

“My mom wanted me to be 

a chemist or something,” she 
said. “I’m not and could never 
be a chemist, but the further 
I committed myself to (musi-
cal theater) and going to (the 
performing arts) high school 
I went to and all of the great 
things that we did, my par-
ents realized that, ‘OK, she’s 
serious about this and she’s 
good at it,’ which I think was 
a hard conclusion for them to 
come to because they’re very 
traditional.”

Music, Theatre & Dance sophomore 

Joshua Strobl hadn’t considered applying 
to the School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
until the father of an alum approached 
him after a high school performance of 
the song “Goodbye” from the musical 
“Catch Me If You Can.” After attending 
MPulse, a summer program run by the 
University for interested Music, Theatre 
& Dance School applicants, Strobl said he 
was hooked.

“The camp here really got me to fig-

ure out that I wanted to do musical the-
ater,” he said. “Obviously, Michigan was 
my number one choice because after that 
camp I had worked with all the profes-
sors that I would be studying with at the 
school … I just fell in love with everything 
he said and his passion to the art.”

Before finding his calling in musical 

theater, Strobl said he was actively look-
ing to pursue a career as a rock musician.

“With me being the lead singer of my 

rock band, we were playing paid gigs 
around LA like the Sunset Strip and the 
Whiskey a Go Go. So, that’s what I thought 
I’d be going into,” he said. “But, as I was 
getting a little more professional in that, 
I realized that the scene is a little rough 
and it’s tough to get into and tough to be 
in. Musical theater was not easier, but I 
feel like I have a longer career in musical 
theater and it was something I was more 
passionate about, too.”

Being half Mexican and half white 

wasn’t something Strobl was actively con-

scious about before coming to campus.

“I had grown up in a town where I was 

viewed as the white guy and they’re like, 
‘You don’t look Mexican,’” he said. “I had 
been told that my whole life and so I had 
just kind of believed that I didn’t really 
look Mexican enough. I didn’t really iden-
tify as a Mexican even though I’m half and 
my mom is full and most of the traditions 
that I do during my holidays and stuff are 
Hispanic traditions.”

It wasn’t until he came to campus, 

Strobl said, that he was able to explore his 
Mexican identity. Playing a range of roles 
in his major allowed him to explore not 
only his ethnicity, but also broaden his 
understanding of what it means to be a 
Hispanic man in musical theater.

“I do tap into my identity and my tradi-

tions that I’ve had as a Hispanic person 
when I’m in a show sometimes,” he said. 
“I’m playing a role right now in ‘Bloody 
Bloody Andrew Jackson,’ and I’m play-
ing a Native American in that. So, I’ve 
tapped into that lot. I’ve called my mom 
and asked about my ancestors and what 
tribe they have been a part of and all that. 
And just to kind of tap into the character 
a little bit more and play that a little bit 
more real.”

Breaking into a professional musical 

theater career with any measure of job 
stability is difficult in and of itself. For 
some, the added strain of fitting into a 
still-homogenous field is yet another 
hurdle to success. 

As he left his interview, Strobl said, 

“This is the most I’ve ever talked about 
my identity, just so you know.”

Personal Statement: Dancing in color

I 

always feel as though I was 
given a second chance. I was 
born in Guatemala City to a 
homeless mother who never 
had the opportunity to go to 

school. She signed my adoption papers 
with her thumb print because she couldn’t 
write her name. She told the social worker 
her one wish for me was a good education.

As I write this article I think about 

what her wish means to me. I attend 
one of the top universities in the world 
and I’m able to pursue my passion for 
dance. When I chose dance as my career 
path, I was unsure exactly of what that 
meant. I wanted to find meaning in my 
work, so I decided to combine my love of 
dance with my passion for social justice 
work, specifically on issues regarding 
racial injustice. Recently, I have realized 
my responsibility as a Latina artist — a 
responsibility to use my art to give a voice 
to those who may not otherwise have one 
in this country.

I grew up in a very white neighborhood 

in 
Brookline, 
Mass. 
that 
was 
very 

accepting of my family. I have two white 
moms and a younger sister who is also 
adopted from Guatemala. Growing up, 
I did not notice I was different from 
my parents. I remember a classmate in 
second grade asking me why my parents 
were white and I was brown. I didn’t 
understand what he meant. I did not see 
myself as any different than my parents. 
It was a harmless question asked by a 
curious 8-year-old, but this question 
sparked many questions I would have to 
ask myself.

I became more and more interested in 

learning about my country and its native 
language. My family and I started taking 
service trips back to Guatemala to expose 
me to the country in which my sister and 
I were born. I slowly started to realize I 
would have been living a very different 
life in Guatemala — I wouldn’t have access 
to a good high school or higher education, 
and most likely would have had to work 
instead of attend school. I started to 
recognize my privilege and, with that, 
my responsibility to give back to the place 
where I come from.

With this newfound recognition of what 

I wanted to do in life, I decided to invest in 
becoming an artist. I believe art can express 
things that words and text cannot. I started 
dancing later than the average dancer. I 
was 15 years old when I officially decided 
to give dance my all. Before I came to the 
University of Michigan, I only wanted 

dance for a professional company like Alvin 
Ailey. But over the past two years here, I’ve 
learned I can still dance for a large-scale 
company and still be involved in other 
outlets of dance — outreach, teaching and 
choreographing to name a few.

Right now, I am most interested in 

creating my own work, connecting my 
heritage to my choreography. I use my art 
to create social justice dances in which I 
can highlight racial injustice happening 
in the United States and in our own 
school. Currently, I am creating a piece 

that will be performed at “Marching 
Forward: A Scholarship Symposium,” a 
series dedicated to shedding light on social 
injustices on campus. My work, “Through 
Our Eyes,” highlights what it feels like to 
be a performing artist of color. The dance 
includes seven dance majors of color from 
the University, including myself.

I created a sound score to accompany 

my piece, featuring interviews with over 
50 students on campus. I talked to Latino 
students about the writing on the Rock 
that targeted the Latino community. Other 

students spoke about being told to go back 
to their country when talking to family 
members on the phone in Spanish in public 
areas on campus. One LSA senior reported 
never being assigned to read a single book 
by a Latino author in all his four years as 
an English major. Another interview with 
a Black student revealed what it felt like 
having the word “N-----” written on his 
door tag in West Quad Residence Hall and 
how there was little to no follow up on the 
incident.

I use these interviews to dance and 

communicate what words cannot express. 
I believe in the saying, “actions speak 
louder than words” and dance, as well 
as other art forms, can inspire people to 
make a difference. Watching a dancer’s 
body move on stage can tell an entire story 
without using words. It can evoke emotions 
in people they may not have had simply 
reading an article online.

Although racist incidents on campus have 

been disheartening, our communities are 
working to empower minority communities 
and fight back. I have been devoting my time 
to form groups within the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance to talk about these hateful 
acts and what we can do to help people 
understand the severity of these them. We 
talk about how we can work as a school to 
react to these events more effectively.

This semester, I have started a group 

called “Arts and Color” along with a few 
more students in the Dance Department. 
This is a group within the department 
where 
undergraduates, 
graduates 
and 

faculty come together to discuss racial 
injustices within our community and plan 
events to have open discussions on race and 
racial injustice on campus.

Being a dancer of color at the University 

has its challenges and advantages. I am 
one of very few dancers of color and one 
of the even fewer Latino dancers in the 
Department of Dance. This lack of students 
of color is not just within our department 
but reflects the University at large. Latino 
students are less than 6 percent and Black 
students are less than 5 percent on campus 
in 2017. We must ask ourselves why this is 
and why our numbers continue to decline, 
instead of grow.

I create work for the fulfillment of my 

passion and for a whole race of people who 
are drastically underrepresented at the 
University, as well as Universities across 
the United States. I use my platform as 
a student and artist of color to bring 
awareness to racial injustices on and off 
campus.

Personal Statement: Someone in the crowd

by Micky Esteban, SMTD junior

I 

grew up in a small town in Connecticut 
where it was impossible for me to get 
lost. In a place where 95.7 percent of the 
population is Caucasian, an Asian stands 

out in a crowd. My school, my dance studio, my 
friends all reflected that demographic. As a 
result, I was my differences. My black hair, my 
dark skin, my almond-shaped eyes 
defined me. And from a young age, 
they defined whom I portrayed 
onstage. The first featured role 
I ever got was in “The King and 
I.” I played the Spanish dancer in 
my dance studio’s “Nutcracker.” 
The next year, I was an Arabian 
princess. When we did “Swan 
Lake,” I played the black swan, 
not the white one. The list goes 
on.

I felt a little more at home in 

the music world. My piano studio 
was fairly diverse, and my teacher 
of nine years was Taiwanese. But 
because I only saw the other kids 
in my studio at holiday or end-of-
year recitals, they were nothing 
more than familiar faces, and the 
community we formed could only 
be described as politely obligatory. 
Most of my music life was spent in a 
tiny practice room at the University 
of Hartford, where I would sit every 
week for lessons — or by myself in 
front of the piano in my living room.

The performing arts world I knew 

growing up was an isolating one. I 
believed I was always going to 
be the one who was not like the 
others. I was always going to play 
“exotic,” or I was going to be at the keyboard by 
myself. On top of that, there was a belief in my 
house that the arts were not a career. My parents 
grew up in the Philippines. My mom and dad 
immigrated to the United States to give their 
children better lives. They come from a culture 
where a career in the arts is virtually unheard 
of and essentially impossible. To them, the idea 
of their child growing up to be an artist was so 
far-fetched it was almost absurd.

I was 16 when I was accepted to the summer 

program at the Alvin Ailey American Dance 
Theater in New York City. My life changed 
entirely. It was my first experience living 
entirely on my own. My first experience living 
in a big city. My first experience immersed in 

an arts community made up primarily of people 
of color. For the first time, I was surrounded by 
other artists who looked like me — artists who 
were my peers, my teachers, my mentors. I was 
actually a bit invisible. I had to work to be seen 
in a sea of brilliant artists, amazing storytellers, 
incredible humans. For the first time, I felt what 

it meant to really be lost in a crowd of people. 
That freed me.

I was going to be a dancer. I craved my parent’s 

approval. I wanted to excel at everything I 
did because I didn’t want to let them down. 
I imagined myself as a doctor, a lawyer, a 
diplomat, a marine biologist, because I knew 
my mom and dad had moved across the world, 
away from their moms and their dads and their 
sisters and brothers and cousins so I could have 
a better life. I have always wanted to make their 
hard work worth it. I have always wanted to 
make them proud.

Comprehension is the key to pride. My 

parents could not comprehend why I would want 
to be a dancer when I could be something else 

that pays better and more consistently. They could 
not comprehend how being a dancer could be 
sustainable, how being a dancer required using my 
brain, how I was not throwing away those years of 
hard work they put into raising me. Even in a well-
developed country with a vibrant arts scene, the 
arts is treated like a frivolity. It’s the only mindset 

my family has really known. My 
parents could not be proud of me 
because they could not comprehend 
the arts. They could not comprehend 
me.

I wanted to become a dancer for 

selfish reasons. My life was already 
a performing art. For most of my 
life, I didn’t need to be on a stage for 
people to stare. But I wanted people 
to look at me the way I looked at 
those dancers at the Ailey School — I 
wanted to command space and time 
and respect because of what I did, 
not because of what I was. I wanted 
to be strong and fierce. Elegant. 
Sensual. Beautiful. Intensely smart 
and incredibly generous.

I have come to realize, however, 

the pursuit of dance or any art form 
cannot be a selfish one, especially 
for a person of color. There’s a 
responsibility that comes with 
inviting people to look at you, to 
look at your body. At its simplest, 
that’s what watching dance is. 
Watching bodies. What they do, 
what they create, what they say. As 
dancers, we are inextricably tied 
to our bodies. We are what we do, 
what we create, what we say. We are 
what makes us different.

I can list every time a person of color has affected 

my dance career, a timeline of every time I’ve seen or 
heard someone who looked like me. A little notch in the 
line every time my life has taken a different direction. 
Every time my views on dance and art and life have 
changed. I can list those moments because they stick 
with me, they define me. Pursuing dance means I might 
define other people’s timelines, other young Filipino 
girls and boys who grew up knowing themselves only 
as the kid with dark eyes and jet-black hair.

There’s an importance, then, that’s inherent in the 

way I move now and in the future. I would be lying 
if I said I could even begin to comprehend what that 
responsibility might mean. But the beauty in art is 
that comprehension isn’t the goal. It’s just the 
beginning.
