Emotions were high Tuesday as people 

headed to the polls. With the ongoing 

COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty 

about what the future may hold, University 

of Michigan students voting in Ann Arbor 

reported feeling that their voices matter 

now more than ever.

Despite pushes for voters to use 

absentee and vote-by-mail avenues, some 

students said they preferred to vote in 

person. Michigan election law changed 

drastically in 2018 through the passage of 

Proposal 3, which allows voters to register 

to vote through Election Day, have a 

straight party ticket voting option and be 

able to vote absentee without needing an 

excuse.

The state of Michigan is expecting to 

see a record number of voters voting by 

mail in this election, as well as potentially 

a record number of ballots cast in the state 

in this election, which could cause delays 

in final tallies for the presidency and U.S. 

Senate. 

Young people are showing up to 

vote early in the state, according to the 

Michigan Secretary of State’s office. 

Approximately 7,900 ballots from voters 

between the ages of 18 to 24 have been 

returned as of Monday — a 12-fold increase 

from the 654 absentee ballots from the 

same age group returned by the eve of 

Election Day in 2016.

While voting absentee is a way to avoid 

large crowds, there are many reasons 

why voters might choose to go in person. 

Voting with an absentee ballot brings the 

possibility of having your vote discarded 

through issues with signature matching, 

which has made some students question 

if they should trust voting by mail, LSA 

junior Maggie Huber said. 

Engineering 
sophomore 
Joshua 

Thomas also agreed, saying the thought 

of President Donald Trump claiming he 

won Michigan’s 16 electoral college votes 

before the absentee votes are counted 

was his deciding factor to vote in person 

despite the health risks associated with 

the ongoing pandemic.

“There’s always that lingering chance 

that Donald Trump might just say, ‘Oh, 

wait, look, we won in Michigan, just stop 

the count,’” Thomas said. “That’s my 

biggest fear, and that’s why I decided to 

vote in person despite the risks.”

Thomas’ concerns mirror those seen 

nationally, as people have raised concerns 

that President Trump will attempt to 

dispute the election results or not leave 

office if he loses. The Graduate Employees’ 

Organization — the union representing 

Graduate Student Instructors at the 

University that went on strike earlier this 

semester — released a statement Monday 

night saying it would join other unions 

across the U.S. in a nonviolent action, 

including a work stoppage, should Trump 

refuse to accept or attempt to undermine 

the outcome.

For many students, this is the first 

presidential election they are eligible to 

vote in. On top of this, many out-of-state 

students are voting in Michigan for the 

first time because the state election policy 

allows those who have lived in the state for 

30 days, including in residence halls or off-

campus housing, to be eligible to register.

Ann Arbor City Clerk Jacqueline 

Beaudry said last week that approximately 

150-180 students were registering to vote 

in Michigan through the satellite office 

at the University of Michigan Museum of 

Art each day before the stay-in-place order. 

Though the stay-in-place order included 

exemptions for election-related activities, 

the number of students registering each 

day dropped to around 60, Beaudry said. 

The order ended at 7 a.m. on Election Day.

These student votes could be critical 

to deciding which party carries the 

presidency and U.S. Senate seat in 

Michigan. 
President 
Donald 
Trump 

narrowly beat former Secretary of State 

Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election in 

Michigan, winning by approximately 

10,000 votes. The state’s executive branch 

flipped in 2018 as voters elected Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer and re-elected Sen. 

Debbie Stabenow along with Democrats 

Dana Nessel and Jocelyn Benson for 

attorney general and secretary of state 

respectively. 

Michigan’s status as a battleground 

state is not lost on students like Kinesiology 

freshman Hannah Waller. Waller, who is 

from the Washington, D.C., area, said she 

voted in Michigan because she felt that her 

ballot held more value in a swing state. 

“I’m actually from D.C. so I was going 

to vote there, but I figured they need my 

vote here more,” Waller said. “I wanted to 

do it in person because it’s my first time so 

I wanted to get that experience. I’m really 

glad I did it in person.”

In Ann Arbor, many polling sites saw 

little or no lines, with the exception of 

the UMMA, which was a location that 

processed same-day registration. Popular 

U-M buildings including the League and 

Union also were used as polling locations.

While safety precautions, such as 

social distancing, mask requirements 

and sanitizing surfaces, were taken, 

some students, like LSA senior Audrey 

Silverman, didn’t trust that others were 

following public health guidelines. 

“I took my own personal precautions,” 

Silverman said. “Right now I’m wearing 

a mask that has a HEPA filter in it which 

is basically the same as an N95. And I 

brought my own hand sanitizer. I know 

that I am protecting myself even if I can’t 

speak for other people.” 

LSA freshman Duncan Goodman, an 

out-of-state student who voted in Ann 

Arbor, said he supported candidates who 

were in favor of small government, but 

only voted on races he was educated on 

and felt could personally impact him. 

He said he wanted to vote in person to 

understand the feeling of what it has been 

like to vote in past elections.

“It was definitely one of those moments 

that made me feel really proud to be an 

American,” Goodman said. “Regardless of 

the outcome, I’m just excited to know that 

my voice was heard, my vote counts and 

mattered and that I’ll get the opportunity 

to do it again and stay involved in the 

process.”

A survey conducted by The Daily, 

which included 1900 students, found 

the environment and racial justice to 

be the most pressing issues for students 

this election cycle. Other top priorities 

included health care and the economy.

Thomas said the country needs to take a 

new approach to health care and is voting 

for candidates who share this ideology. He 

is among the 85% of students, as surveyed 

by The Daily, who are voting for Joe Biden 

and Kamala Harris for president and vice 

president, respectively.

“I think that not voting for Joe Biden, 

and not punishing Republicans for what 

they’ve done for four years, it’s inexcusable 

for me,” Thomas said. “The chance that 

my vote cancels out like some like, really 

nasty dude in my hometown is kind of 

satisfying.”

For some, this election feels like they 

are voting to protect their rights and 

quality of life. Recent U-M graduate 

Emma Scott said getting Trump out of 

office is important to her.

“As a queer person of color, it’s just 

terrible,” Scott said. “Just getting him out 

— that’s just the most important thing on 

my mind. Even if the other candidates 

aren’t ideal, just get him out. The current 

administration has just no regard for the 

citizens.” 

Election results can sometimes be 

shocking to students when they find 

themselves surrounded by people of 

similar ideologies on campus, LSA senior 

Sofia Calderon said. Calderon said she has 

a lot of friends who are environmental 

science majors so their beliefs strongly 

influence hers.

The election has been a significant 

source of stress for more than two-

thirds of adults, an increase from around 

half in 2016, according to the American 

Psychological 
Association. 
University 

administration has prepared for increased 

resources for students after the election 

through Counseling and Psychological 

Services, Wolverine Support Network and 

Michigan Medicine.

“The community that I’m in, everyone 

agrees with me politically,” Calderon said. 

“Everyone has kind of the same views, 

same leanings (in) my group of friends, 

the people I live with and people I interact 

with. Most people that I’ve talked to at the 

University kind of are on the same page.” 

Calderon’s views echo those expressed 

in 2016, when students stunned by Trump’s 

unexpected victory congregated in the 

Diag for a “vigil” for the fate of the country 

and rights of minorities. More than 

1,000 students, faculty and community 

members, including University President 

Mark Schlissel, gathered in the Diag the 

night after the election to protest Trump’s 

win. Approximately 90% of students 

who voted in the 2016 election did not 

vote for Trump. At the time, Schlissel 

said Trump’s win was revealing of the 

country’s feelings.

Above all, students told The Daily they 

felt proud to exercise their right to vote 

in this election. After he finished voting 

at the Union, Engineering junior Tommy 

Pickup, an Italian dual citizen, said he felt 

excited to vote for the first time at such a 

pivotal moment for the country.

“I feel like it’s just more of a feeling of 

civic responsibility,” Pickup said. “At this 

kind of political, state, and environment. 

I feel like this is the time where a lot of 

decisions need to be made, and people 

need to go out and vote.”

University of Michigan students 
and 
leadership 
are 
preparing 
support services for the community 
as the turbulent election cycle 
comes to a close.
Stress over the results of the 
election combined with ongoing 
issues like the COVID-19 pandemic 
and systemic racism have students 
on campus concerned as Tuesday 
nears. More than two-thirds of 
adults have reported the election 
being a significant source of stress 
in their lives, an increase from 
just over half of adults polled in 
2016, according to a study from 
the 
American 
Psychological 
Association. 
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzegerald said the school has 
prepared for Election Day on 
campus by inviting speakers to 
address the importance of voting. 
He noted how the satellite clerk’s 
office at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art — where students 
can register to vote and cast their 
ballots up until 8 p.m. on Tuesday 
— has made voting more accessible. 
What 
the 
University 
is 
offering
The 2016 election left many 
students 
on 
campus 
rattled, 
with University President Mark 
Schlissel and other community 
members voicing concern at a vigil 
on the Diag.
In preparation for the campus 
climate after Tuesday’s election, 
the University has created a 
Campus Climate Support group. In 
addition, resources will be available 
for students after the presidential 
election through Counseling and 

Psychological Services, Wolverine 
Support Network and Michigan 
Medicine. University faculty will 
have access to consultation and 
support groups as well. 
“Election cycles by their nature 
can be very stressful times,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 
“A 
fiercely 
contested 
presidential 
election 
during a pandemic, when some 
have questioned the democratic 
process itself, is creating high levels 
of anxiety for many members of our 
community.”
LSA sophomore Nick Schuler, 
vice president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, said 
he would not need to use campus 
resources after the election, but 
recognizes that the services are 
there for those who need it. 
“I do think that if you have to go 
see a therapist if Trump wins, then 
that’s a little out there,” Schuler 
said. “People have their rights and I 
guess if it helps you, go for it but it’s 
definitely not something I would 
do.”
LSA junior Arya Kale said 
counseling services are valuable 
after an emotional event like a 
presidential election.
“Mental health is important,” 
Kale said. “And judging from the 
conversations I’ve had with my 
friends, people are realizing it’s 
importance even more now than 
we were before. CAPS is a great 
service and it’s really nice to have 
that available.”
CAPS has faced criticism for 
its long wait times and lack of 
accessibility, inspiring students 
to create their own resources to 
focus on mental health. As of press 
time, the next available date for an 
initial consultation is Nov. 30.
In terms of safety after the 

election, the University will have 
the Division of Public Safety and 
Security send alerts to students 
and make themselves available for 
students to express their concerns, 
according to Fitzgerald. 
“The university is always on 
alert for Election Day and the 
possibility of protests or other 
disturbances,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“It’s clear we are headed toward a 
record turnout this year and that 
requires added attention from all 
of us.”
During 
the 
weekly 
Friday 
Campus 
COVID-19 
briefing, 
Public Policy Dean Michael Barr 
said University organizations are 
working with officials at the local, 
state and federal level. 
“Some of you are more worried 
about safety broadly during the 
election,” Barr said. “There are 
daily meetings, incident response 
teams and University protocols. 
The University will continue to 
communicate with the whole 
campus about staying safe.” 
Election heightens stress for 
some, but not others
Gina 
Liu, 
LSA 
sophomore 
and 
United 
Asian 
American 
Organization advocacy chair, is 
coordinating an Election Day care 
package that students can pick up 
on campus. Liu said she wants to 
support students with material 
items as a distraction.
“I think there is fear around 
the election, whether or not you 
actively participate in it,” Liu said. 
“With the election care package, 
we just want to have a no-strings-
attached model and make sure 
people have extra support through 
material items.”
Liu said she will volunteering as 
a diversion from the anxiety that 

comes with a presidential election.
“I’ve been relying on those 
Election Day tasks, but definitely 
putting off actually dealing with 
the results of the election,” Liu 
said. “People are also saying it’s 
not going to be 100 percent on the 
first day and that would definitely 
cause more anxiety for me and a lot 
of other people.”
Business 
sophomore 
Taylor 
Bielefeld, a member of Students for 
Biden, noted that increased mail-
in voting could delay final results.
“We 
have 
this 
natural 
predisposition where we think 
Election Day is one day and we 
know the night of,” Bielefeld said. 
“Now more than ever, this is not 
true. This is election season … We 
just have to perservere through 
that and not expect an immediate 
result.”
Business freshman Nick Rea, 
who is involved with Students 
for Biden and the One Campaign 
Michigan, said he’s been trying to 
avoid “obsessively checking” polls 
and worrying about the results. 
Instead, Rea said he’s turning to 
physical outlets to deal with his 
anxiety.
One coping mechanism Rea 
plans on using: purchasing a piñata 
of President Donald Trump’s head 
to take out his emotions on.
“It will give me something to 
channel my stress out because I’ll 
need something to keep my mind 
off of a lot of the results because 
I know there’s a lot of states that 
won’t even start counting their 
votes until after polls close or 
Wednesday,” Rea said.

Michigan Secretary of State 
Jocelyn Benson told CNN Tuesday 
she anticipates the state’s votes will 
be tallied earlier than previously 
anticipated. 
“What we’ve seen is such high 
efficiency and so little problems 
that I now think we’ll clearly get 
results much sooner,” Benson told 
CNN reporter Miguel Marquez. 
“We anticipate a mix of both 
in-person 
voting 
results 
and 
absentee voting results will be part 
of the results, the first results, you 
hear out of Michigan.”
According to CNN, Benson said 
on Tuesday she “expects cities 
and counties statewide will report 
results at about the same time 
meaning a so-called ‘red mirage’ 

may not happen in Michigan.”
However, spokesperson Kelly 
Rossman-McKinney called CNN’s 
characterization overenthusiastic. 
In a tweet Tuesday night, she wrote 
that the outlet “was a little too 
excited about the story.” She noted 
that Benson “told the reporter there 
might be SOME counts completed. 
Definitely not ALL.”
“Despite 
@CNN’s 
story, 
Michigan votes will NOT all 
be counted tonight,” Rossman-
McKinney wrote in another tweet.
In a statement to The Michigan 
Daily, 
Rossman-McKinney 
said 
Benson was misquoted.
When contacted for clarification, 
Tracy Wimmer, director of media 
relations for the Secretary of State’s 
Office, said it is unlikely that all 
ballots will be counted tonight.
“While there has been an 
incredible number returned, we 
know that the thousands of clerks 
and poll workers processing and 
tabulating 
these 
ballots 
have 

been hard at work across the 
state 
today,” 
Wimmer 
wrote. 
“While that may enable certain 
jurisdictions to complete their 
counts later this evening or during 
the early morning hours tomorrow, 
we still do not believe we will have 
full unofficial results tonight, as we 
have been consistently saying for 
weeks.”
State and local officials have 
been asking residents to temper 
their 
expectations, 
reminding 
people that tallying mail-in ballots 
will be time-intensive. 
At a Monday press conference, 
Benson warned that it could take 
several days to count the state’s 
votes.
“Some jurisdictions may report 
their full unofficial results sooner 
and that’s great,” Benson said. 
“We welcome that, and from the 
moment the polls closed until 
the moment that full unofficial 
statewide tabulation is complete, 
we will continue to update all of you 

and the public and the nation as to 
where we are in the process.” 
She 
also 
pointed 
out 
that 
Tuesday’s election will not differ 
significantly from other years if 
results take a while.
“To ensure every ballot is 
counted accurately, that takes 
time,” Benson said. “In Michigan, 
our election workers count absentee 
ballots in pairs, one Republican and 
one Democrat, to ensure there’s no 
political bias and that every ballot 
is counted fairly. This takes time, it 
always has.”
In a tweet Tuesday afternoon, 
Benson said that over 92% of all 
Michigan absentee ballots were 
returned four hours before the 8 
p.m. deadline to drop them off, 
adding that absentee counting is 
going “smoothly & very efficiently.”

More than 50 people proudly 
wearing “I voted early” and Biden-
Harris stickers congregated in front 
of the Electrical Workers Local 
252 building in Ann Arbor to hear 
from Doug Emhoff, the husband of 
Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice 
presidential candidate.
The stop was one of two in 
Michigan on Sunday for Emhoff, 
who was in town to launch a 
canvassing event. This comes a 
day after Democratic presidential 
nominee Joe Biden joined former 
President Barack Obama in Detroit 
and Flint for his last campaign 
event in the state before Tuesday’s 
election. 
Emhoff spoke to the crowd about 

traveling around the nation and 
seeing voters’ exhaustion with the 
Trump administration.
“Everywhere I go around this 
country, it’s the same thing,” 
Emhoff said. “People are sick and 
tired of what’s going on right now, 
they’re sick and tired of this lack of 
leadership. They’re sick and tired, 
and they want change. And in just 
a couple of days Michigan, we are 
gonna win this state.”
Michigan is considered a key 
battleground state for the 2020 
election. Trump narrowly won the 
state in 2016 by just over 10,000 
votes, though Democrats saw big 
wins in state leadership in the 2018 
midterm election. Biden is ahead by 
eight percentage points in the state 
with a few days to go before the 
election, according to The New York 
Times/Siena College poll. 
Emhoff went on to further 

emphasize the need to win the 
election by turning out the vote. 
“We got to vote in massive 
numbers,” Emhoff said. “We got to 
win. We got to win big because we 
need a mandate. We need a mandate 
that’s so big, so clear, that this guy 
cannot refute it, no matter how hard, 
you know, he’s gonna try, and you 
know he’s gonna try. And the only 
way to push back on that is to crush 
him — crush him here in Michigan.”
Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., 
emphasized the importance of 
campaigning until the very last 
second to ensure that Biden wins. 
“We can’t take anything for 
granted,” Dingell said to the crowd. 
“The next 48 hours, we got to be 
on doors. We’ve got to be calling 
everybody. We can’t stop for the next 
48 hours.” 
James Johnson, an organizer for 
IBEW Local 252, emphasized the 
need for strong leadership in the 
Oval Office.
“I want a leader who will fight 
for me and will fight for all of us,” 
Johnson said. “I want a leader with 
a concrete path to give us certainty 
— security — instead of bullying and 
lying. But in order to get that leader, 
we all need to go vote. Michigan’s 
gonna get to decide the next 
President of the United States, but 
only if we go vote.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Andrew 
Schaeffler, the founder and president 
of Students For Biden, expressed his 
gratitude to Emhoff paying a visit to 
Ann Arbor.
“I am so happy that the future 
first first gentleman Doug Emhoff 
came to Ann Arbor, and myself and 
our club are so happy to see the 
emphasis put on Michigan by the 
Biden campaign,” Schaeffler said. 
“At all of these events, including this 
one, the Biden campaign has made 
clear that on all issues impacting 
Michiganders — the choice is clear 
this November on which candidate 
is better for Michiganders.” 
Nick Schuler, LSA sophomore 
and spokesperson for U-M College 
Republicans, said that the Biden 
campaign’s 
efforts 
will 
prove 
ineffective and Trump will win 
reelection. 
“The Democrats can campaign 
all they all want,” Schuler said. “But 
the great people of Michigan will 
deliver the state for Trump because 
he brought back jobs and fixed our 
economy.”

Emhoff told The Daily in an 
interview Sunday that the campaign 
is taking Michigan seriously this 
election, citing visits from himself, 
Harris and Biden to the state. 
“I’m here and we are doing 
everything we can to get the word 
out that we have a plan to tackle 
multiple crises that are affecting 
our country,” Emhoff said. “(Biden 
and Harris) are going to bring us 
together, people are sick and tired 
of all the division and hatred that’s 
coming out of this administration. 
They want leadership, they want 
competence, they want unity and 
some compassion, and Joe and 
Kamala really bring that.”
Emhoff also said he has seen a lot 
of misinformation this election cycle 
from conservatives, specifically to 
discourage voting. He said the best 
way to combat this is to do exactly 
what he says Republicans don’t want 
people to do: vote.
“There’s a lot of misinformation 
out there and a lot of tactics that 
the other side is using to try to 
discourage people from voting and 
make it sound like it’s something 
that’s hard,” Emhoff said. “That’s 
just totally not true — it couldn’t be 
easier, and the only way that we’re 
going to be able to push back on that 
narrative is to vote and to win and 
win big. And that’s what we plan to 
do.”
Emhoff said he believes a lot of 
college students have figured out 
exactly how elected officials and 
their decisions directly impact their 
lives.
“They’re excited because I think 
they now realize that it does matter, 
their vote does matter because when 
they don’t vote, they don’t have voice 
and when they don’t have a voice, 
things are happening to them that 
they don’t like and they want to 
change,” Emhoff said. 
Emhoff 
emphasized 
the 
importance of everyone exercising 
their right to vote this year, especially 
in swing states like Michigan. 
“No matter what, people need to 
vote,” Emhoff said. “It’s their right, 
and it’s been a hard fought right. 
Take the time and exercise your 
right, just go out and vote. Your vote 
is your voice.”

Biden, Obama visit Flint, rally voters before Nov. 3

Former President criticizes current administration’s COVID-19 pandemic response, endorses Michigan Democrats

Only 
three 
days 
before 
in-person polls open for the 
Nov. 3 presidential election, 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate 
Joe 
Biden 
and 
former 
president 
Barack 
Obama held their first joint 
appearances at car rallies in 
Flint, Mich., and Detroit on 
Saturday afternoon. 
The 
two 
repeatedly 
endorsed Michigan Democrats 
running for re-election this 
Tuesday, including Sen. Gary 
Peters, D-Mich.; U.S. Rep. 
Haley Stevens, D-Mich.; and 
Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. 
Obama criticized Trump for 
his response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, laying the blame 
for hundreds of thousands of 
lives lost at the president’s 
feet.
“If Trump were focused on 
COVID from the beginning, 
cases wouldn’t be reaching 
new record highs across the 
country,” Obama said. “ … 
He’s going around having big 
events, no masks, no protective 
gear, no precautions. What’s 
his obsession with crowds, 
anyways? He’s still talking 
about his inauguration crowd 
being small, though he doesn’t 
admit it.” 
“Does 
he 
have 
nothing 
better to worry about? That 
was four years ago,” Obama 
added. “What kind of trauma 

did he go through? Did no one 
come to his birthday parties 
when he was a kid? Is Fox 
News not giving him enough 
attention?” 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
spoke at the event in Detroit, 
urging people to vote for 
Biden. 
“The road to the White 
House goes through the great 
state of Michigan,” Whitmer 
said, 
a 
message 
echoed 
throughout the evening. 
In 2016, the margin of 
victory by which President 
Donald Trump won Michigan 
was the smallest of any state, 
with only 10,704 votes. Then-
Democratic 
presidential 
nominee Hillary Clinton faced 
criticism for not adequately 
campaigning in the region. 
While polling shows Biden 
leading Michigan, Trump’s 
campaign has said they believe 
the numbers are wrong and 
that they can win the state. 
Trump is scheduled to visit 
Michigan three times in the 
two days before the election, 
after rallying supporters in 
Lansing, Mich., earlier this 
week.
On 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
Trump made multiple stops 
in 
Pennsylvania, 
including 
a large rally with several 
thousand 
attendees. 
The 
Trump campaign has held 
large events consistently in 
previous 
months, 
despite 
experts’ 
warnings 
that 
gatherings 
of 
this 
scale 

could 
spread 
COVID-19. 
As of Saturday afternoon, 
approximately 
230,000 
Americans have died of the 
virus.
Obama 
also 
criticized 
the Trump administration’s 
attempts 
to 
repeal 
the 
Affordable Care Act. Obama 
said Trump and his staff were 
trying to limit Americans’ 
access to health care, which 
he 
said 
was 
particularly 
egregious during a global 
pandemic. 
“Republicans love to say 
right before the election they’ll 
protect 
your 
preexisting 
conditions,” 
Obama 
said. 
“Joe and I actually protected 
them 10 years ago with the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act. 
We 
didn’t get Republican votes, 
not one … They promised a 
new plan for 10 years now, 
no plan. They still don’t have 
a plan, when asked about it, 
nobody can find it.”
Obama 
then 
pretended 
to look around the podium, 
joking that Trump’s health 
care plan must be “in the 
same place with the pandemic 
playbook that we gave them” 
in reference to a pandemic 
preparedness plan developed 
by the Obama administration 
that Republicans have denied 
existed. 
Before the pandemic, the 
state of the economy had 
been a point of pride for the 
Trump administration and a 
central point of his reelection 

campaign. Obama said Trump 
inherited a good economy 
from Obama when he left 
office and that the loss in jobs 
shows Trump’s failures.
“Donald Trump likes to 
claim he built this economy,” 
Obama 
said. 
“America 
created one and a half million 
more jobs in the last three 
years of the Obama-Biden 
administration than the first 
three years of the Trump 
administration. That’s a fact. 
That was before he could 
blame the pandemic.” 
Obama 
also 
said 
manufacturing 
grew 
in 
Michigan by 15% during his 
years in office and only 1% 
during 
Trump’s 
term. 
He 
ended his remarks by urging 
Michiganders to vote.
“Last 
time, 
we 
were 
complacent, some of us (were 
complacent),” 
Obama 
said. 
“We said ‘Eh, I don’t need 
to bother voting.’ I get why 
Americans 
get 
frustrated 
sometimes, 
government’s 
not perfect (and it) won’t 
solve every problem, but it’ll 
make things better … You’ve 
got almost half of eligible 
voters not voting, and those 
are some of the same folks 
complaining.” 
Biden 
highlighted 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 
insufficient 
response 
to 
COVID-19. 
“Imagine where we would 
be if we had a president who 
had worn a mask, instead of 

mocked it,” Biden said. “I can 
tell you this, we wouldn’t have 
5 million confirmed cases 
of COVID in this nation, we 
wouldn’t have 230,000 deaths 
… He knew and he hid it from 
the people, he knew it was so 
much worse than the flu, he 
lied to the people. He knew it 
wasn’t going to disappear.” 
Biden also discussed his 
economic plan, including his 
plan to raise taxes on those 
making over $400,000 per 
year. He criticized Trump in 
light of an investigation into 
the president’s tax returns 
published by The New York 
Times, showing the president 
paid $750 in income taxes in 
2016 and 2017. 
“I understand something 
Donald 
Trump 
doesn’t,” 
Biden 
said. 
“Wall 
Street 
didn’t build this country, you 
did. People like my parents, 
ordinary 
working 
people 
in this country, and unions 
build the middle class, that’s 
a fact … Why should all of 
you be paying more taxes 
than 
Donald 
Trump 
the 
billionaire?”
Biden 
continued 
by 
discussing Trump’s previous 
remarks about soldiers and 
prisoners of war, some of 
which disparaged American 
troops. He also noted that 
Russian President Vladimir 
Putin had put bounties on U.S. 
soldiers in Afghanistan and 
that Trump has not spoken to 
Putin about the issue. 

“Donald Trump isn’t strong, 
he’s weak … Donald Trump 
doesn’t understand sacrifice, 
he doesn’t understand the 
courage it takes to wear 
that uniform,” Biden said in 
reference to his late son Beau, 
who served in the military,
Trump commented on Biden 
and Obama’s remarks in Flint, 
which were similar to those 
delivered in Detroit, after 
the event. He tweeted about 
the Obama administration’s 
relationship 
to 
the 
Flint 
water 
crisis, 
criticizing 
their handling of the water 
contamination.
“Biden & Obama owe a 
massive apology to the People 
of Flint,” Trump tweeted. 
“The 
water 
was 
poisoned 
on their watch. Not only did 
they fail them, Biden proudly 
accepted the endorsement of 
disastrous Gov Rick Snyder! 
Unlike Biden, I will always 
stand with the People of the 
Great State of MICHIGAN!”
The event concluded with a 
final push for Michiganders to 
vote and move forward. 
“So for God’s sake, please 
vote,” Biden said. “Everyone 
knows who Donald Trump is, 
let’s show him who we are. 
We choose hope over fear, we 
choose unity over division, we 
choose science over fiction, 
and we choose truth over lie 
after lie after lie after lie.”

The Trump campaign held 
a “Trump Pride” event this 
Thursday in Ann Arbor to 
appeal to LGBTQ+ voters, 
with around 30 attendees. 
Most attendees wore face 
masks for the duration of 
the event, but speakers took 
them off while they were on 
the podium. Former Director 
of 
National 
Intelligence 
Richard 
Grenell, 
current 
Special Presidential Envoy 
for Serbia and Kosovo Peace 
Negotiations, 
headlined 
the event. Grenell became 
the highest-ranking openly 
LGBTQ+ government official 
in American history, and the 
only openly LGBTQ+ person 
to have ever served in the 
cabinet.
In 
the 
2016 
election, 
only 14% of LGBTQ+ voters 
reported to have voted for 
Trump, a stark comparison to 
the 78% who reported backing 
former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton. The Trump 
administration 
has 
upheld 
policies 
that 
undermine 
LGBTQ+ 
rights, 
including 
banning transgender people 
from the military, attempting 
to remove nondiscrimination 
protections for transgender 
people 
in 
health 
care 
and 
rolling 
back 
other 
nondiscrimination policies. 
The event was opened by 
Adam Schmidt, former U.S. 
national team figure skater 
and 
an 
LGBTQ+ 
Trump 
supporter. Schmidt said the 
Democratic party is a party of 
exclusion. 
“They are the party of 
exclusion; they are cancel 
culture; they are the opposite 
of inclusivity, all right. We 
are the party of inclusivity,” 
Schmidt said.
Several attendees at the 
event 
highlighted 
their 
economic interests as one of 
their principal reasons for 
supporting President Trump. 
One 
attendee 
described 
how he was excited for the 
event, specifically for the 
chance to interact with other 
individuals who identify as 

both conservative and gay.
Bill 
White, 
former 
President of the Intrepid Sea-
Air-Space museum in New 
York City, highlighted his 
experiences 
working 
with 
Trump through the 1990s. 
White went on to criticize 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, just 
weeks after the FBI foiled a 
coup attempt. Whitmer has 
blamed Trump’s rhetoric for 
inspiring the kidnapping plot. 
“In California, you can 
recall your governor, can you 
do that here? Well, we want 
to help you with that,” White 
said. 
White 
also 
generally 
criticized Republican Senator 
and 
former 
Republican 
Presidential Nominee Mitt 
Romney.
“The funny guy from Utah, 
who needs to be recalled too, 
but he gave us the vote for 
Coney Barret, so thank you, 
senator,” White said. 
Grenell dismissed criticism 
of President Donald Trump 
during his speech.
“You know HRC has a list 
of 100 things that Donald 
Trump did to be anti-gay, 
and you know almost every 
single one of them are about 
big government versus small 
government,” Grenell said.
Grenell 
was 
the 
final 
speaker 
and 
spent 
a 
significant amount of time 
arguing that President Trump 
has 
an 
immense 
amount 
of respect for the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
“Donald Trump was a New 
Yorker who in the ’80s was 
around so many gay people 
and was incredibly impacted 
by AIDS in New York City,” 
Grenell 
said. 
“(Trump) 
fundamentally 
understands 
what gays have been through. 
He doesn’t think of us as 
extra, he doesn’t think of us as 
anything other than a diverse 
group of people that are just 
like every normal American, 
and that’s exactly what we’ve 
been asking for.”

While Kale expressed concern about the outcome 
of the election, he said having a community with his 
friends and housemates has helped him out during 
the stressful season of an election. 
“It’s helpful to form a community within the 
place that I’m living in,” Kale said. “My housemates, 
we’ve been keeping tabs on what’s been happening 
politically, the best way to stay safe and how to limit 
our interactions outside. It’s been helpful forming a 
small, little group. That way we’re not going insane 
by ourselves.”

LSA COLLEGIATE LECTURE

From Better

Lethality:

Crystallization 
of Pharmaceuticals 
and Explosives


Should we do this again? 
University of Michigan students 
and administrators are asking that 
exact question about the current 
hybrid semester ahead of the 
upcoming decision on whether to 
bring students back to campus in 
the winter semester.
Unlike the decision on the fall 
semester, which was announced 
in June during a state and 
nationwide 
lull 
in 
COVID-19 
cases, the pandemic is headed in 
the wrong direction. The United 
States just registered its greatest 
single-day case increase — nearly 
100,000 cases in a 24-hour period 
— and Dr. Anthony Fauci told The 
Washington Post recently that the 
country “could not be positioned 
more poorly” going into the winter.
Despite the challenges of the 
fall hybrid semester — clusters 
in residence halls, strikes across 
campus in September and the 
two-week stay-in-place order — 
transmission outside of young 
people’s social gatherings remains 
low, 
according 
to 
University 
officials, and hospitalizations and 
deaths have not risen with cases. 
According 
to 
University 
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald, the 
University is looking at several 
factors for the winter semester 
decision.
“Among 
the 
considerations: 
health, safety and wellbeing of our 
community; lessons learned from 
the fall term related to teaching 
and learning; survey results from 
faculty, students and staff; and 
feedback from many different 
advisory 
groups 
on 
campus, 

students, 
faculty 
and 
staff,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email.
Fitzgerald added that COVID-19 
testing “will be part of the plans.”
Students’ views on the hybrid 
semester are mixed. Six students 
interviewed by The Daily said 
they were in favor of attempting a 
hybrid semester again, two were 
opposed and one was indifferent. 
They expressed the wide range 
of sentiments across the student 
body as the community weighs 
the value of health and normalcy 
in a pandemic-marred college 
experience. 
About 80% of undergraduate 
classes were held virtually at the 
start of the year, and with the 
recent order, only 10% maintain 
any in-person instruction. Some 
students rely on in-person classes 
for their major, like pre-med LSA 
sophomore Sophie Boock, who has 
labs that can’t be taken virtually. 
“To be able to still go in once 
every three weeks and have that 
hands-on experience has been 
great,” Boock said. 
LSA senior Jacob Katzman also 
relies on in-person labs and said 
he wouldn’t be in Ann Arbor next 
semester if it was entirely virtual.
“If I can’t get into the lab, I can’t 
do my thesis, so it would definitely 
set me back if we weren’t allowed 
to come in,” Katzman said. “I’m 
very grateful we’re allowed to 
come in this semester.” 
Others found in-person classes 
less essential, like Kyra Freeman, 
a Public Health graduate student, 
who opted into virtual classes 
after the first few weeks for 
convenience. LSA freshman Jenny 
Nam lives in East Quad Residence 
Hall and said she became more 

hesitant to attend in-person classes 
when cases in her residence hall 
started rising.
“I was definitely a lot more 
nervous being in my dorm because 
we started getting a lot of emails 
about how we were getting a new 
COVID case like every day, so then 
I was like, ‘Oh, so many people are 
stuck in one dorm building, it could 
spread really fast,’” Nam said.
As of Oct. 26, residence halls 
have recorded 472 cases since 
the beginning of the semester, 
and many resident advisors have 
voiced concerns over health and 
safety.
LSA junior Shivang Chandna 
said his off-campus apartment 
is a sunk cost, but he’d wait and 
watch public health metrics before 
deciding to move back for the 
winter.
“If they do go a hundred percent 
remote and things are okay here, I 
definitely want to be back, because 
I love the city — I love everything 
about it — but if cases keep going 
up and it’s a hundred percent 
online, I’d rather be back home,” 
Chandna said. 
U-M 
administration 
has 
cited the high proportion of 
students with off-campus leases 
as justification for the hybrid 
fall semester. With a link to the 
physical campus, administrators 
argued, students would be more 
likely to follow public health 
guidelines. 
Most students The Daily spoke 
with said they would be back in 
Ann Arbor regardless of next 
semester’s format, including LSA 
sophomore Sam Pinkus. The time 
difference between Michigan and 
her California home would put her 

synchronous 8 a.m. class at 5 a.m.
“Already looking into remote 
learning 
for 
the 
week 
after 
Thanksgiving is a little daunting,” 
Pinkus said. “There’s definitely 
like an academic feeling (on 
campus) still, so I think it’s easier 
to get things done here than at 
home.”
LSA 
senior 
Eliot 
Giannoni 
said he’ll be back in Ann Arbor 
regardless to “finish off the college 
experience.” However, he said 
connecting with people has been 
harder this year. 
“I can only imagine for freshmen 
just coming on campus for the 
first time and not really knowing 
anyone, that’s got to be difficult,” 
Giannoni said. “Academically, it’s 
been hard as well to connect with 
your peers on a group assignment.”
But 
engineering 
sophomore 
Mohammed 
Kashan 
said 
he 
thinks the winter semester should 
be entirely virtual for the safety 
of students and others close to 
campus.
“It would be safer because 
to be honest, with people that 
are as young as undergrads, and 
even grad students, it’s hard to 
understand what this virus is 
doing,” Kashan said. 
Most students who favored 
another hybrid semester said the 
University needs to make changes 
for the winter. Some noted the 
lack 
of 
communication, 
like 
Chandna, who said he has seen 
“disorganization” with the recent 
case escalation and stay-in-place 
order.
“I mean, literally three or four 
weeks ago they were like, ‘Do 
in-person events up to 25 people’ 
and this and that,” Chandna said. 

“And then fast forward to now, 
we’re under lockdown, cases are 
going up and I don’t think this is 
going to improve.”
Pinkus said it’s also been 
hard for her to keep up with the 
University’s 
changing 
public 
health guidance.
“We just get a new email every 
day with new rules and regulations 
regarding COVID and what we’re 
allowed to do and what we’re 
not allowed to do,” Pinkus said. 
“Obviously the world is changing 
every day and the school’s trying to 
keep up with that, but just having 
more clear communication with 
students (would be helpful).”
Othera said the University 
needed a more robust testing 
plan to bring students back next 
semester. 
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel has repeatedly 
defended the initial plan that 
did not test off-campus students 
who were asymptomatic upon 
their arrival to Ann Arbor. A 
community 
sampling 
testing 
program now tests over 3,000 
community members per week, 
but the program didn’t reach 1,000 
weekly tests until a month into the 
semester. 
Outside of the surveillance 
testing 
programs, 
if 
students 
have a COVID-19 scare and want 
immediate 
testing, 
they 
have 
to have symptoms or be a close 
contact of a positive case. Nam 
noted that many go off-campus 
to get tested, leading to a lag in 
reporting cases. 
“I know people have had 
experiences where they’ve had a 
lot of trouble trying to get tested 
for COVID,” Nam said. “I feel like 
if they made it a lot easier and made 

it a lot more accessible, that would 
be a lot better, but it would also 
expose the fact that they’re getting 
a lot of COVID cases, so they 
probably don’t want to do that.” 
Chandna said he couldn’t say 
yet what the University should do 
because it depends entirely on its 
testing capacity.
“If they are equipped enough to 
handle another semester hybrid 
with random testing, more rapid 
testing, then of course hybrid — 
otherwise, 100% online is the way 
to go,” Chandana said. 
Overall, Nam said, COVID-19 
is going to be a part of the winter 
semester no matter what, so the 
state of campus will depend on 
whether people follow public 
health guidelines.
“Obviously we’re not going to 
get the experience that we were 
supposed to get if COVID was not 
a thing, but I think that rather than 
depending on the University as a 
whole to just take care of things, 
like everything, it would be nice 
for the entire community to also 
work towards being more careful 
and following safety guidelines,” 
Nam said. 
Boock said even with all of the 
turmoil of the last few months, 
the fall semester is better than it 
would’ve been if students weren’t 
allowed back on campus. 
“I always think there’s room 
for more improvement, but I think 
we can take this and keep going,” 
Boock said. “We love it here — we 
came back for a reason.”

Within the first 30 seconds of 
Monday night’s Zoom meeting, 
members 
of 
the 
University 
of Michigan’s chapter of the 
College 
Democrats 
began 
discussing possible presidential 
election results. With anxiety 
regarding Tuesday’s election 
and the additional stress of 
mail-in ballot counting delaying 
results, 
the 
student 
group 
struggled to stay calm. 
LSA senior Carolyn Chen 
stated frankly: “I am recklessly 
optimistic. I am ready to be hurt 
again.” 
Chen said she was proud 
of the University’s high early 
voting turnout, emphasizing 
the effectiveness of the satellite 
voting location at the University 
of Michigan Museum of Art. 
State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-18, 
spoke 
at 
the 
Zoom 
rally. 
Showing 
excitement 
about 
tomorrow’s election, Irwin also 
emphasized what rights are at 
stake.
“I’m riding with Biden,” 

Irwin said. “We all know what’s 
at stake. The world’s burning, 
we’re facing climate change and 
have no national strategy. We’re 
lagging behind on education 
and labor rights. The rights 
of women in this country are 
tremendously under pressure.”
Irwin reminded attendees of 
the importance of getting in any 
last votes, saying voter turnout 
has never felt more important 
due to the polarization of 
Tuesday’s election. 
“We need to squeeze out 
those late voters, those maybe 
voters, and let them know why 
it matters,” Irwin said. 
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, 
D-Mich., spoke after Irwin, 
reiterating the necessity of 
voting and inspiring young 
voters 
to 
prepare 
for 
a 
generational change.
“Young voters are a decisive 
factor 
in 
this 
electorate,” 
Gilchrist said. “We need to take 
advantage of this generational 
opportunity.”
Next to speak was U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who 
was unafraid of hiding her own 

election anxiety. 
“I’m scared shitless,” Dingell 
said. “I was really scared four 
years ago, I thought Hillary 
Clinton was going to lose, 
nobody believed me.”
Dingell told participants to 
expect hazardous rhetoric to 
come from Trump this week.
“Donald Trump’s going to be 
shoveling fake news tomorrow, 
and we need to shovel it back up 
his blank. I won’t say it, but you 
know what I’m saying,” Dingell 
said.
Dingell 
then 
introduced 
her fellow representative, U.S. 
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., 
whom Dingell referred to as her 
“sister.” 
“She really is my sister,” 
Dingell said. “You don’t want to 
screw with the two of us.” 
Tlaib 
shared 
the 
other 
speakers’ 
concerns 
and 
emphasized 
her 
desire 
to 
see the end of the Trump 
administration.

Should the ‘U’ have in-person classes this winter?

Students weigh in on impending decision from the University regarding courses, reflect on challenges of hybrid fall plan

This semester hasn’t looked 
the same for any organization 
on campus, and the Michigan 
Marching Band is no exception. 
For the first time since its 
founding in 1896, the band has 
pursued a fully virtual format.
Despite these challenges, 
band 
members 
have 
been 
fostering friendships, learning 
new skills and staying safe.
After months of planning 
this summer, the band staff 
chose to adopt a module style 
of learning. Students enrolled 
in ENS 348 just like normal 
times, but instead of practicing 
at Elbel Field Monday through 
Friday from 4:45-6:15 p.m., the 
band members are learning 
completely 
asynchronously. 
The two-week modules are 
themed so that the musicians 
are able to hone their skills and 
learn techniques they wouldn’t 
normally be able to.
“No 
one 
was 
expecting 
this to be a substitute for an 
in-person season, but I speak 
for many people when I say 
that we’ve gotten things out of 
it that we couldn’t normally get 
from a busy band schedule,” 
said LSA junior Kaitlyn Colyer, 
the 
leader 
of 
the 
piccolo 
section.
LSA 
junior 
Shelby 
Ostrewich, an alto saxophone 
player, said she likes how 
module-style 
learning 
has 
allowed the band to learn 
different skills.
“My favorite so far has been 
the flag for non-flags since it 
gave me an excuse to be more 
active and get off my laptop,” 
Ostrewich said. “It helped me 
have a whole new appreciation 
for our color guard.”
During 
traditional 
years, 
the band’s rehearsal schedule 
is planned down to the minute. 
This year, the pandemic made 
that impossible, Band Director 
John Pasquale said.
“It’s completely different in 
every possible way,” Pasquale 
said. “Quite literally 100% 
of (the program) had to be 
examined, and then changed.”
The staff has worked to keep 
the performers engaged.

“We obviously care about 
their safety first and foremost, 
that is paramount,” Pasquale 
said. “Then, their experience 
is a very close second.”
Not only have the modules 
given 
the 
students 
an 
opportunity to see behind the 
scenes, they have also helped 
integrate freshmen with their 
fellow band members through 
collaboration, 
according 
to 
LSA freshman Alina Stinson, 
an alto saxophone player.
“The group work aspects of 
these classes have introduced 
me 
to 
so 
many 
different 
people,” Stinson said.
Of 
the 
nearly 
400 
performers who were accepted 
to be a part of the Michigan 
Marching Band this season, 
more than 250 students have 
enrolled in the optional virtual 
model while the others opted 
out. Anyone in the MMB 
this season will not have to 
reaudition next year.
Auditions for the subsequent 
academic 
year 
are 
held 
during the summer each year. 
Pasquale said he was “floored” 
by the number of students 
who chose to audition despite 
uncertainty about what the 
upcoming season would look 
like.
“All things considered, it 
was a very positive audition 
cycle,” Pasquale said.
The MMB plans to release 
two completely virtual shows 
this semester. The first one, 
scheduled for early November, 
is titled “Hail to the Everyday 
Heroes” and will be a tribute 
to the frontline workers in the 
pandemic.
“The 
resiliency 
of 
the 
students I am so proud of and 
inspired by every day, by the 
spirit of the Michigan family 
and community that is seen 
by the students and faculty, 
staff, alumni and supporters,” 
Pasquale said. “How people 
are coming together — it’s only 
a testament to the strength of 
the Michigan community.”
The 
second 
show 
that 
will be released around the 
Michigan vs. Ohio State game 
in December and will be 
completely designed, arranged 
and written by students.

In an ordinary season, the 
section student leaders are 
charged with teaching first 
and 
cultivating 
community 
second. This year, community 
comes first given that organic 
connections are difficult to 
foster virtually. From section 
“Among Us” games over Zoom 
to remote watch parties for 
game days and virtual quiet 
study 
sessions, 
the 
band 
members are trying to stay 
connected in any way possible.
Stinson, who opted to live 
at home in Michigan with 
her 
family 
this 
semester, 
said that she has made many 
close 
friends 
— 
freshmen 
and upperclassmen alike — 
through events organized by 
the alto section.
“I’ve been amazed by the 
sense of community within 
the band, even in a virtual 
form,” Stinson said. “I feel 
just as included as if I were on 
campus.”
However, building a sense of 
community in the absence of 
in-person practices is without 
a 
doubt 
challenging. 
LSA 
junior Will Padbury said it’s 
helped immensely that he lives 
with fellow members of his 
section.
“We 
experience 
virtual 
band 
together, 
reminisce 
about previous seasons, and 
help each other stay focused 
and optimistic for next year,” 
Padbury said.
Colyer said section leaders 
have always been responsible 
for welcoming new members. 
However, 
the 
nuanced 
challenges this semester have 
made it important to ensure 
new 
members 
know 
they 
have a friend without being 
overbearing.
“We’ve also had to strike a 
balance between letting people 
know we’re here and we’re 
actively interested in their 
participation in the band, but 
also respecting that people are 
overwhelmed with the amount 
of 
time 
they’re 
spending 
online,” Colyer said.

The 
ideal 
vacation, 
Paris, 
remains a special place for many 
aching for a life of romance, buttery 
croissants and artful architecture. 
The French language seen as poet-
ry, the streets of France idealized 
and the air romanticized as every-
one hopes to become entranced by 
Paris and France’s overall allure. 
Emily in Paris is the embodiment 
of that glamorization as Netflix’s 
carefree dramatic comedy stars Lily 
Collins as an American who has 
difficulty assimilating to French 
society. Having not studied the 
language prior to her arrival, her 
misunderstandings of the language 
are running jokes as she flaunts her 
Parisian influenced style and dis-
covers France. A sucker for guilty 
pleasures like this show, I eagerly 
binged all the episodes in two days. 
As I finished the show, I couldn’t 
help but think about how my expe-
rience in Paris could never look like 
Emily’s.
Like Emily, my mouth waters 
just thinking about French pas-
tries — chocolate croissants in 
particular — and decadent meals 
cooked with rich meats and fancy, 
unpronounceable glazes. Roaming 
the cobblestone streets in wander-
lust, purchasing groceries from 
an aesthetically pleasing French 
market and finally utilizing the 
French language I worked so hard 
to acquire were daydreams that 
kept me sane throughout stringent 
French courses. However, France 
has made it illegal for people like 
me to see these dreams through, 
unlike Emily, with their current 
ban on hijab. 

Attempting to stay true to an 
ideal of secularism, the country has 
made it illegal for Jews to dress in 
yamakas, Christians to wear cross 
necklaces, Sikhs to cover in dastars 
and Muslim women, like myself, to 
drape our hair in hijabs. Though the 
ban prohibits all religious apparel, 
the ban is rooted in the mainstream 
misconception that Muslim women 
who dress in hijabs are oppressed, 
that the hijab is an oppressive tool 
and that France, a republic built 
on liberty, equality and fraternity, 
cannot condone the oppression of 
women. Seemingly a contradiction 
as founding womens’ ideals on their 
clothing and reducing women to 
their appearance is oppressive and 
sexist in and of itself, the country 
does not care for promoting unity 
as their goal is to villify Islam to 
the French public. Due to the hijab 
being a physical embodiment of 
Islam and Europe’s overwhelming 
belief that Muslims are behind all 
of their political and social pitfalls, 
it is evident that this ban is moti-
vated by anti-Muslim convictions.
Anti-Muslim rheotric is the 
mainstream in France, as demon-
izing and disrespecting Islam is a 
social norm. Charlie Hebdo, a pop-
ular French satirical magazine, is 
no stranger to this phenomenon as 
its existence is a ruthless reminder 
of fervent French anti-Muslim big-
otry. Known for angering Muslims 
worldwide because of its purpose-
fully intolerant depiction of our 
last Messenger, its content is heav-
ily baked in this notion that Mus-
lims are either stupefying fools or 
threatening terrorists. Just scroll-
ing through its website makes me 
regret the years of French schooling 
I endured; the organization takes 
every possible opportunity to profit 

off of common anti-Muslim speech. 
Its top five most popular articles 
listed on its website, as I write this 
article, are centered on crude and 
derogatory jokes of Muslim figures 
and Muslim culture, even attacking 
Arabic; the language of the Quran 
and coincidentally the language 
that gave the French its numerals, 
as horsetalk. Sports is not a cul-
tural medium immune from anti-
Muslim bigotry. Despite a majority 
of France’s soccer players coming 
from Africa and the Arab world 
and identifying as Muslim, its play-
ers are categorized as French when 
they win and Arabs or Africans 
when they lose. Zidane, arguably 
the most successful French soccer 
player, is of Algerian and Muslim 
descent and even his prestige could 
not save him from France’s ram-
pant anti-Muslim bigotry. If a man 
that has delivered the French a 
world cup and multiple champion-
ships continues to be the at the end 
of anti-Muslim rhetoric, is there 
any Muslim that can be immune 
from French sponsered anti-Mus-
lim hatred? As the country contin-
ues to capitalize on anti-Muslim 
sentiments, France and some of its 
inhabitants remain keen on harm-
ing their Muslim neighbors in a 
country that just so happens to hold 
the most Muslims in the Western 
world.
The culmination of brewing 
anti-Muslim beliefs and a disen-
franchised 
Muslim 
population, 
France has been the setting for a 
petrifying exemplification of the 
domino effect. About two weeks 
ago, a teacher who chose to depict 
offensive Charlie Hebdo comics 
was beheaded by a terrorist. In 
response to the terror attack, Presi-
dent Macron, a man who identifies 
as politically centerist, stated that 
Islam was a religion “in crisis all 
over the world” and a threat to the 
West. I find it important to note 
that this was a man that claimed 
he wanted to save Lebanon fol-
lowing the disastrous earthquake 
and finds Muslim countries very 
appealing to his country’s dan-
gerous and exploitive infatuation 
with globalism. Angered by the 

anti-Muslim comments made by 
Macron, Muslim majority country 
leaders like Imran Khan of Pakistan 
and Erdogan of Turkey called for a 
boycott of French products. Fol-
lowing the horrific incident, anoth-
er terror attack occured when two 
Algerian women donned in heads-
carves were beaten and stabbed by 
two French women ironically near 
the symbol of France, the Eiffel 
tower. The women were harassed 
and called “Dirty Arabs,” a result 
of widespread anti Arab senti-
ments in the nation. In a horrifying 
retaliation to French enabled anti-
Muslim sentiments, a man iden-
tifying as Muslim stabbed three 
people at Notre Dame, all of whom 
died due to his cruelty. This led to 
an anti-Muslim man attempting to 
set a mosque ablaze as he poured 
gasoline onto its walls, arson he for-
tunately was not able to fully com-
plete, but an assault on the religion 
nonetheless. 
All of these terror attacks stem 
from a festering anti-Muslim gov-
ernance and culture. Prejudice, 
like Muslim and French blood, 
spills into the streets of France as 
rhetoric is spewed and legislation 
is drafted to antagonize the sec-
ond most followed religion in the 
world and those who follow it. As 
France continues to play victim, 
I can’t help but think about the 
countries France attacked over 
the past few centuries and its con-
tinued obsession with Islam and 
the Muslim veil. Having colonized 
countries like Tunisia, Lebanon, 
Egypt, Morocco and Algeria, it 
seems ironic that the French gov-
ernment claims that Islam is a “ter-
ror” when France has terrorized 
Muslim majority nations. To list all 
the cruelties committed by France 
to Muslim majority nations is vir-
tually impossible, cementing that 
France is the true opressor. Despite 
its beautiful appearance, its core is 
ugly, operating on the premise that 
Emily can be in Paris, but Eman 
cannot.

Emily can be in Paris, but Eman cannot

Thank God, I thought, as the 
aromatic plate made its way 
closer and closer to my table. I 
tore off the mask I’d been wear-
ing since entering the dimly lit 
restaurant, noting the lip gloss 
imprint on the inside. Yup, 
that’s going in the trash once I 
get home. 
The double-masked waitress 
placed our dishes in the middle 
of the table as my friends and 
I whipped out our cameras for 
the classic brunch Snapchat. As 
I navigated my phone, a notifi-
cation popped up: “1,500 new 
cases of COVID-19 today, the 
third consecutive day of rising 
cases in the state of Michigan.” 
I stared at it until the notifi-
cation disappeared from my 
screen, then looked around me. 
One couple 10 feet away, anoth-
er a little closer — man, why 
couldn’t they seat us outside?
The pandemic made dis-
persed and speedy features in 
our discussion — the “when’s 
that vaccine coming,” the go-to 
“this is all so crazy”, the slight-
ly bitter “at colleges they’re 
completely business as usual.” 
Just like the weather, COVID-
19 has become the automatic 
default for any awkward silenc-
es — “the nasal swab barely 
hurt” joining “it’s cold outside” 
in the reservoir of small talk 
go-tos. As America sees little to 
no veritable progress in stifling 
the virus, those of us privileged 
enough to do so have mentally 
conquered COVID-19: all by the 
process of externalization. To 
an extent, this process definite-
ly makes sense — our local, state 
and federal government make 
or break community responses 
to the virus, with implementa-
tions (or lack thereof) of vari-
ous regulations and mandates. 
However, at the same time, 
the actions of an individual 
quite literally initiate a domino 
effect. We all know COVID-19 
spreads like wildfire, with no 
definitive rhyme or reason — 
arguably every single time we 
go outside, there is a risk. Yet 
still, we’ve created parameters 
for our own peace of mind: out-
side or bust, gatherings of 25 or 
less (because the virus makes 
a U-turn once there’s no 26th), 
and intermittent hand sanitiz-
ing. 
These measures are valuable, 
and without them we would 
definitely have less public safe-
ty than we do now, but this mid-
dle-ground approach has left us 
to dwell in an indefinite sort of 
purgatory with no visible end 
in sight. While New Zealand 
and Taiwan are essentially 
‘back to normal,’ we look to 
them with envy without realiz-
ing the stringent measures they 
mandated to get to that place. 
For some, mask wearing is 
viewed as a form of groupthink, 
another way the government is 
trying to demand conformity. 
As such, mesh net masks have 
popped up to stick it to the man 
(yeah!) and let onlookers know 
that you may have been duped, 
but they haven’t. If beating the 
pandemic is striving for a light 
at the end of a tunnel, we’re 
currently navigating the same 
tunnel instead with random, 

small flickers of a candle, the 
extinguishing of which brings 
us all the way back to the tun-
nel’s entrance.
Was this just the luck of the 
draw for Americans? Is it just 
the vastness of our country that 
made the pandemic more wide-
spread here? As a nation con-
sistently purported as the ‘best 
in the world,’ our response to 
COVID was anything but. And 
interestingly enough, that may 
have to do with the ego we all 
carry as Americans- individu-
alism at all costs. According 
to a recent study published by 
the Social Science Research 
Network, higher rates of local 
individualism reduced adher-
ence to state lockdown orders 
by 41 percent and pandemic-
based fundraising by 48 per-
cent. Interestingly, areas of 
the country that have higher 
historical exposure to frontier 
conditions 
have 
empirically 
been proven to partake less in 
mask-use, social distancing and 
trust of science. This mindset 
is ingrained as an American 
value from our earliest les-
sons in elementary school and 
clearly display long-term impli-
cations: On one end, individu-
alism encourages innovation 
and entrepreneurship, but on 
the other, it stifles any sense of 
social responsibility and col-
lective action, characteristics 
needed in a pandemic-stricken 
country.
As such, here we are today 
— amid the indefinite slug of 
COVID purgatory. Ironically 
enough, many students have 
been forced to think collec-
tively in light of universities’ 
individualistic approaches. I’ve 
heard stories of some having 
to exaggerate symptoms just 
to get tested, others renting 
AirBNBs so they can quaran-
tine from their roommates, and 
many like myself, opting to stay 
home this semester to — among 
other things — avoid getting 
roped into an unused lease. 
When everything in our coun-
try seemingly operates like a 
business, the aforementioned 
mindset has permeated into a 
lot of our institutions, putting 
individual (oftentimes profit-
based) interests over serv-
ing communities. As we head 
towards what may very well be 
the second spike of COVID-19, 
I propose a reframing of the 
Great American Individualism: 
Instead of considering it as the 
pursuit of singular enjoyment 
at all costs, we pursue our sin-
gular safety in the face of an 
unending pandemic. To this 
end, be self-interested enough 
to say no if you’re not comfort-
able attending an event, eat-
ing indoors or even entering 
maskless settings simply and 
only because you’re protect-
ing yourself from the virus’s 
reach. When our government, 
our schools, and even ourselves 
may not immediately perceive 
those as primary concerns, 
consideration of the virus must 
be ingrained in our individual 
mindsets: we — myself and my 
homegirls at brunch included 
— need to confront the cogni-
tive dissonance of dissociating 
our responsibility in the fight 
against the coronavirus when 
quite literally we are potential 
vectors.

The evident ‘I’ in pandemic

Disclaimer: Islamophobia is a phrase that doesn’t truly embody anti-
Muslim rhetoric and actions. The word, literally meaning a fear of 
Islam, legitimizes fear of Muslims, as if we are a people to fear or 
operate like regular and logical horrors of spiders and heights. I do 
not condone nor do I use that phrase in my daily life as I attempt to 
distance myself from the misleading caricature of a term. In its place, 
I will use the phrase anti-Muslim and urge you to do the same as your 
refer to anti-Muslim bigotry.

When you look at this image, 
what do you see? Do you see the 
large animal-like figure that is 
front and center? The uncivi-
lized behavior portrayed by 
the figure? What about the 
small innocent-like characters 
in the back? The presence of all 
these factors makes this image 
the definition of the destruc-
tion that arises from the pres-
ence of any implicit bias held 
in society, and in particular, 
the Angry Black woman ste-
reotype. This cartoon was cre-
ated to portray a tennis match 
between Serena Williams and 
Naomi Osaka in 2018. When 
Williams expressed frustra-
tion with calls made through-
out the sets, and questioned 
the umpire’s intentions and 
authority, the umpire made 
calls that resulted in Serena’s 
defeat. This perpetuated Wil-
liams’ frustrations, causing 
passionate responses to the 
injustices. This resulted in the 
media characterizing her as 
an Angry Black woman. This 
stereotype 
unfairly 
classi-
fies Black Women’s emotions 
and opinions as unrealistic 
and unprofessional in order to 
deem us unqualified to occupy 
powerful positions and spaces. 
This image is a perfect exam-
ple of how dangerous this ste-
reotype is.
The artist makes Williams 
the center of attention by mak-
ing her take up the most space, 
and making her so apparently 
different from the charac-
ters in the background. Her 
enlarged head, mouth and body 
suspended above the smashed 
racket work to exaggerate the 
anger she expressed, through 

an apparent temper tantrum. 
The two other characters are 
small in comparison to Wil-
liams, with features that rep-
resent innocence and purity, 
to establish her as an animal. 
The artist makes Williams’ 
emotions seem irrational, and 
labels her as an Angry Black 
woman, something powerful 
Black women are constantly 
reduced to. The emotion she 
expressed during the match 
was no different than that 
of other professional tennis 
players, including the famed 
Roger Federer. So why was 
she punished with the cre-
ation of such a dehumaniz-
ing and false image? 
Seeing Kamala Harris, a 
Black woman, make history 
by running for one of the 
highest occupations in the 
United States is empowering 
to see as a Black woman, but 
also extremely nerve wrack-
ing. As I watched the Vice 
Presidential debate a few 
weeks ago, I couldn’t help 
but shake with nerves the 
whole time. Knowing how 
the passion Black women 
express can be redefined 
by others as aggression, I was 
scared to see how the media 
would respond to her demean-
or. Throughout the debate, I 
was constantly refreshing my 
Twitter timeline to see how 
people were reacting to every 
word that came out of her 
mouth. I was scared that one 
slip of the tongue would cause 
her to be labeled as an Angry 
Black woman, and create a loss 
of respect from everyone, sim-
ply for speaking her mind. Joe 
Biden showed an abundance 
of emotion in calling Donald 
Trump a clown a few weeks 
before in his own debate. His 

outburst was commended, and 
even seen as comical. Aside 
from the immature behav-
ior he showcased in the same 
debate, Donald Trump’s care-
lessness and negligence dur-
ing his presidency have put 
millions of Americans in grave 
danger. Trump and Biden were 
able to get away with acts of 
unprofessionalism, but I knew 
from my experience of watch-
ing other Black women like 

Serena Williams and Michelle 
Obama, that the critics would 
not be as forgiving of any 
degree of emotion communi-
cated by Kamala Harris.
Now, some may say Ser-
ena’s emotions during that 
tennis match did get a little 
out of control, and that she 
deserved the label. But the 
problem is not how much or 
what kind of emotion a Black 
woman expresses, the prob-
lem is our emotion will always 
be exploited and used to twist 
the narrative of our character. 
When Michelle Obama was on 
the campaign trail in 2008, 

supporting her husband Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s cam-
paign, she also suffered the 
cruel consequences of the ste-
reotype. In her documentary 
Becoming, released this past 
May, she described how the 
vulnerability, passion and love 
she expressed for America on 
the campaign trail was depict-
ed by the media as anger, and 
devalued the abundant success 
she had in her life. Much like 

the one of Serena Williams, a 
caricature was drawn in an 
attempt to portray her as an 
enemy of the very people she 
loved. In the image below, the 
artist enlarged Obama’s head 
and bulked up her muscles, 
giving her an unrealistic and 
manly appearance. Her eye-
brows were tweaked to appeal 
to an evil facade. The words 
“Bully Pulpit” on the podium 
described the meaning of her 
speeches as expressions of 
rage. The image embraced 
everything the media said 
about her. The artist trans-
formed her into an Angry 

Black woman.
Michelle 
Obama 
admit-
ted feeling hurt by the false 
ways the media has portrayed 
her. The backlash influenced 
her to change her approach 
to one that was robotic and 
scripted in order to be taken 
seriously as the future First 
Lady of the United States. 
At seven years old, I vaguely 
remember watching the news 
and hearing this narrative be 
constructed of her. They 
turned my idol into a mon-
ster. Everything negative 
the media said about her 
was hurtful to hear, being 
my first introduction to 
the Angry Black woman 
persona in real time. It 
hurt even more because I 
saw myself in her. Every 
time they picked her apart, 
I felt like they were picking 
me apart as well. I started 
to become weary of how I 
acted in public spaces in 
order to avoid being falsely 
stereotyped, because when 
you start seeing parts of 
yourself being told they 
don’t belong, you start to 
believe it. 
Kamala Harris is pursuing 
a dream the Black community 
has had for a long time. The 
rarity of her situation should 
be celebrated. In addition to 
the praise we give her, it is 
important to note that Kamala 
Harris is a politician and cor-
ruption is inevitable. In her 
career as an Attorney, she has 
already done some pretty con-
troversial things. Harris faced 
scrutiny over her claims of 
working to decrease the racism 
in the criminal justice system. 
Many have argued that these 
statements are hypocritical 
with her failure to investigate 

shootings 
involving 
police 
officers and implement reform 
bills that would help decrease 
police brutality. It is important 
to hold politicians accountable 
for the decisions they make, 
but while we are condemning 
her harmful actions toward 
minority 
communities, 
we 
need to recognize the implicit 
biases that may influence how 
we perceive her actions. She 
is the first Black woman in 
American history to be a vice 
presidential nominee for a 
major party, so she will be held 
to an extremely high standard. 
Because of this, when we criti-
cize her decisions we need to 
make sure that the criticisms 
don’t 
diminish 
her 
worth 
based on the stereotypes held 
of Black women. While we 
acknowledge her accomplish-
ments, we must also address 
her faults appropriately. 
Reflecting 
on 
Michelle 
Obama and Serena Williams’ 
experiences I can’t help but 
wonder how much of herself 
Kamala Harris is concealing in 
order to avoid the creation of 
another Angry Black Woman 
caricature. I worry that young 
Black girls today will be driv-
en to change themselves in 
order to appeal to the masses 
because of the false narrative 
the media may use to portray 
her. Despite the implicit bias-
es that I know will be held 
against her, seeing her in that 
high space gives me hope that 
there will be positive change 
in the systemic racism this 
country 
embraces. 
I 
hope 
little Black girls are able to 
look up to Kamala Harris the 
same way that I looked up to 
Michelle Obama.

 MARIA PATTON
MiC Columnist
The manipulation of a Black woman’s passion

On Oct. 13, 2019, over 100 
wildfires broke out in Leba-
non, setting the scene for the 
insufferable year ahead. Over 
the course of the last year, 
Lebanon 
has 
experienced 
an economic crisis, a global 
pandemic and an explosion 
at their largest port, all while 
citizens are revolting against 
their 
corrupt 
government. 
Though the wildfires have 
been contained, Lebanon has 
been up in flames for the past 
year, growing more disas-
trous by the day. 
On Oct. 17, 2019, the Leba-
nese 
thawra 
(revolution) 
began. The unfolding of an 
economic crisis caused the 
corrupt, sectarian govern-
ment to announce additional 
tax 
measures, 
triggering 
Lebanese citizens to protest 
for their social and economic 
rights. The goal of the pro-
tests extended beyond oppo-
sition to the additional tax 
measures; the Lebanese were 
protesting a fundamentally 
corrupt and flawed govern-
ment, who for years have 
denied them basic aid and 
services. They were protest-
ing government officials who 
failed to provide them with 
stable electricity and waste-
management services, ade-
quate public education and 
health services, food security 
and a functioning economy. 
In the midst of their failures, 
those government officials 
have made millions of dol-
lars (some even billions) for 
themselves. To end the cycle 
of corruption, the people of 
Lebanon called for all gov-
ernment officials to resign. 
Prime minister Saad Hariri 
was the only government 
official to resign, causing no 
substantial change for the 
Lebanese. 
Equally 
guilty 
politicians, Nabih Berri and 
Michel Aoun, stayed in power. 
As the revolution contin-
ued, 
Lebanon’s 
economic 
system continued to weak-
en. Lebanon, the third most 
indebted country, with a debt 
to GDP ratio of 152%, and 
with over 75% of its popula-
tion living below the poverty 
line, inevitably was about to 
face their worst economic 

crisis. Lebanon’s broken eco-
nomic system can be traced 
back to their heavy reliance 
on imports and the pegging of 
the Lebanese currency to the 
US dollar. Massive increase 
in prices of staples, the crash-
ing of the Lebanese curren-
cy, high unemployment and 
limits on bank withdrawals 
characterize the effects of 
Lebanon’s 
economic 
crisis 
on their people. As a conse-
quence of the economic crisis, 
the middle class disappeared 
and issues of food and home 
security were at an all-time 
high. Then COVID-19 hit, 
exacerbating Lebanon’s con-
dition and further revealing 
the government’s unwilling-
ness to aid their people.
On Aug. 4, a fire at the larg-
est port in Beirut triggered 
an explosion, resulting in 
over 200 people dead, 6000 
injured and at least 300,000 
displaced. 
The 
explosion 
further 
weakened 
health 
resources 
and 
destroyed 
valuable infrastructure, leav-
ing the Lebanese people to 
deal with a pandemic, an 
economic crisis and recon-
struction efforts with little to 
no resources or government 
aid. Carelessness and disor-
ganization of the Lebanese 
government directly caused 
the third largest explosion 
in history. Angry protests 
broke out, demanding the 
government would be held 
accountable for their actions. 
The outcome of the protests 
in August was similar to the 
outcome of the protests in 
October: Hassan Diab, prime 
minister, 
resigned, 
but 
it 
brought no change for the 
people suffering. 
Almost one year after his 
resignation, Saad Hariri was 
reinstated as Lebanon’s prime 
minister. His reinstatement is 
a clear representation of the 
direction of Lebanon. The 
purpose of the thawra was 
to dismantle the system in 
place, completely controlled 
by the corruption and greedi-
ness of the Lebanese govern-
ment and propelled by foreign 
interests. Saad Hariri repre-
sents everything the people 
revolted against. As long as 
people like him are the key 
players in Lebanese politics, 
Lebanon will remain stuck in 
a circle of corruption.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

If you can keep calm in the face of 
provocation, Aries, his can be an 
exceptional week for your career. 
Teamwork shows you in a good 
light, so don’t neglect your 
colleagues. It’s not 
always about going it 
alone or being top dog.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

Allow yourself to listen to your 
inner instincts. Your intuition is 
strong, and your mind is able to 
recognize things that your 
conscious may actively choose to 
ignore. In doing so, you 
will be able to choose 
the path that is best for 
you. 

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

In this romantic week, communi-
cation between you and your 
sweetheart is almost telepathic. 
You can make an unbeatable 
team now, Cancer, as your shared 
goals and dreams are 
coming to fruition. If 
you’re single, look out 
for someone who 
shocks you.

TAURUS

Dip your toe into exciting waters 
by being prepared to try 
something new. From exotic travel 
to adrenaline sports or intriguing 
affairs, you’re willing to take a risk 
now if something stirs 
your soul. Beyond your 
comfort zone, Taurus, 
life takes off.

VIRGO

PICES

LIBRA
LEO

An easing of financial pressures 
does a lot of good for your anxiety 
and mental health, Leo. However, 
it’s important now that you take 
control of your own emotions. 
Don’t leave yourself 
vulnerable, mentally, to 
fluctuating external 
circumstances.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

Your superpower this week is your 
creativity, Virgo. You have a 
strong feel for lateral thinking and 
innovative ideas, or creations will 
get you noticed. Don’t feel that 
you have to do things the 
way they’ve always 
been done. Dare to be 
different.

Loving support from your family 
means a great deal to you this 
week and you’ll feel blessed by 
those closest to you. If someone 
confides in you, Libra, it’s vital that 
you keep their confidence. 
Don’t turn this into an 
issue of trust.

Your words have a lot of power and 
presence this week, and once the 
Sun arrives in your own sign, 
Scorpio, your magnetism and 
charisma are off the scale. All of 
this means that people are 
taking notice of you – so 
you’d better have 
something meaningful 
to say.

Recognition at work is long 
overdue but welcome, nonethe-
less. This week, Sagittarius, 
stretch your ambitions by looking 
for new challenges. Not 
necessarily a new job, 
but new responsibili-
ties within your 
existing role. You’re 
more than capable.

You have the gift of the gab this 
week, Capricorn, so you’re able to 
put your opinions quite forcefully 
without coming across as 
insensitive or dogmatic. Turn this 
to your advantage if you 
want to get someone to 
agree to a new idea.

Messages from your dreams 
become easier to recall and 
interpret this week. Spend some 
time with a dream journal if you 
can – there is a lot if insight here 
which could change your 
life, Aquarius. Don’t 
dismiss what you can’t 
quite understand.

This is a healing week for a close 
relationship, Pisces, which will 
benefit from as much fun and 
laughter as possible. Socialize as a 
couple if you can, because you’ll 
love seeing each other in a new 
light. Mix and mingle, 
enjoy good company, 
and shine.

Mixed emotions: balancing safety and sanity
T

he 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health 
Department’s 

stay-in-place 
order 

announcement was met with a 
mixture of emotions. Some were 
hardly surprised, with the rising 
COVID-19 cases and the nature of 
the week ahead being both the first 
Michigan football game day at home 
and Halloween. However, even 
without a stay-in-place order or a 
global pandemic, this is a stressful 
time of year. It is because of these 
additional stressors, that the stay-
in-place order made me particularly 
concerned for what it would mean 
for the well-being and mindfulness 
of those affected; now more than 
ever, we must learn how to adapt 
and celebrate in unorthodox ways. 
Though it may seem vague at first, I 
would argue that within ambiguity 
lies the true message of this piece: 
There is no need for specificity. 
Celebration for me likely feels very 
different from a celebration for you. 

The increasingly intolerable stress 

has been undeniably augmented 
by the details of the stay-in-place 
order. From the very beginning of 
the school year, it was already clear 
that college freshmen were missing 
out on major parts of the college 
experience my friends, peers and 
I feel so lucky to have had. Beyond 
the handlings and mishandlings 
of the pandemic by the University 
of Michigan administration, the 
unique spirit of the Leaders and Best 
has been missing since I returned to 
campus. 

Imagine adding midterms, the 

obstacles of remote learning and 
the constant fear that every time 
you leave your room you have a 
decent chance of exposing yourself 
to COVID-19 on top of an already 
lackluster foundation for the school 
year. Now consider the turbulent 
and emotionally draining political 
climate; it all builds upon each other 
and proves to be a fierce foe for even 
the strongest or stablest of psyches. 

As someone living in a one-

bedroom apartment, the stay-in-
place order immediately terrified 
me. I had just submitted my last 
midterm and looked to my calendar 
for my weekly plans as a much-
needed 
detox. 
While 
everyone 

operates differently, it is proven that 
having something to look forward 
to — whether you write it down 
somewhere or add it to your calendar 
or whatnot — is an excellent way 
to provide yourself with necessary 
rewards and incentives, especially in 
times of duress. 

However, 
the 
stay-in-place 

order essentially canceled all of my 
plans, despite already being within 
COVID-19 guidelines. It would 
be ignorant for me to attempt to 
discuss the pandemic’s effect on 
the University without confronting 
the irrefutably irresponsible actions 
of some students on campus. The 
case numbers do not lie and a stay-
in-place order, while frustrating 
and 
potentially 
psychologically 

harmful, is at least supported by both 
qualitative and quantitative data. 

So what do we do? It grows 

tiresome to continue telling others 
and ourselves to “look at the bright 
side,” when all we want to do is sing 
“Mr. Brightside.” I want game day 
to be a sea of maize and blue; I want 
110,000 people in a stadium. I want 
the reverberation of a professor’s 
voice in Angell Hall, the white 
noise of a Blue Bus temporarily 
overpowering the hustle and bustle 
of students walking to class, even 
the sticky floors of a frat basement 
with the stench of cheap cleaning 
supplies and the incomparable 
sounds we took for granted in the 
pre-COVID-19 world.

While this may read like a stream 

of consciousness instead of a concrete 
opinion, I think that is ultimately 
the best I can do to show you how I 
truly feel. It’s okay to feel uncertain 
and not perfectly cohesive in your 
perspective given the situation. I 
feel my morality more than ever 
before like the literal manifestations 
of Freud’s id and superego perched 
upon my shoulders. Despite having 
already had COVID-19 and now 
having antibodies, should I lock 
myself away in my one-bedroom 
apartment? How do we weigh the 
benefits and burdens of a stay-in-
place order that in itself holds so 
many confusing contradictions? 

I

f there was any doubt 
before 
the 
pandemic 

that the term “student-

athlete” 
was 
oxymoronic, 

there isn’t any longer. My 
inbox in the week leading 
up to the Michigan football 
game 
against 
Minnesota 

included 
both 
guidelines 

from 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan about how to follow 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

emergency order and emails 
from the Michigan Athletic 
Department reminding me 
about game day. The email 
on Oct. 20 from University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

announcing the stay-in-place 
order didn’t mention the term 
“essential workers,” but the 
exception 
for 
University’s 

athletes (nearly all of whom 
are 
undergraduates) 
made 

it clear that is what the 
University has deemed them. 

The 
term 
“student-

athlete” was invented by the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association to avoid labor 
laws. In 1955, a Fort Lewis 
A&M football player named 
Ray Dennison suffered a fatal 
injury during a game. When 
his widow filed for workers’ 
compensation 
benefits 
for 

Dennison, 
a 
scholarship 

athlete, then NCAA executive 
director 
Walter 
Byers 

concocted a legal strategy to 
ensure college athletes would 
not be seen as employees in 
the eyes of the law. The term 
“student-athlete” was born, 
invoking amateurism as a 
way to avoid both payment 
and liability, and it stuck. 
And Ray Dennison’s wife lost 
her lawsuit. 

In 1984, Byers came out 

against the system that he 
had helped create, accusing 
the NCAA of exploiting the 
athletes under the guise of 
amateurism. He stated that 
campus 
athletic 
programs 

had adopted a “neoplantation 
mentality” where “the coach 
owns the athlete’s feet, the 
college owns the athlete’s 
body, and the athlete’s mind 
is supposed to comprehend 
a rule book that I challenge 
(the 
NCAA’s 
chief 
of 

enforcement) Dave Berst … to 
explain in rational terms to 
you inside of eight hours.” 

A 
recent 
NCAA 
policy 

change to allow athletes to 
profit off of their name, image 
and likeness is the first major 
step toward acknowledging 
that college athletes are not 
exactly amateurs, but that 
money would come from a 
third party, not the NCAA. 
Schlissel has tried to keep up 
the pretense that the school’s 
athletes are, in-fact, students 
first. In May, he stated that 
there would not be football 
unless there were in-person 
classes. He is just barely 
able to keep that promise, 
even as undergraduates are 
under a stay-in-place order, 
by allowing “all classes that 
are substantially enhanced 
by in-person instruction” to 
continue in-person. 

According 
to 
an 
email 

from University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald, about 10% 
of 
undergraduate 
classes 

still have some in-person 
components. 
Given 

on-campus 
residents 
can 

return 
home 
and 
receive 

prorated room and board, 
in-person 
classwork 
is 

clearly not a major concern 
for most. 

Schlissel contends varsity 

athletics pose little risk of 

transmitting 
COVID-19. 

Daily testing certainly helps 
mitigate 
the 
spread, 
but 

it’s worth noting that the 
week of Oct. 17, the athletic 
department 
reported 
26 

cases. Not exactly nothing. 

Yes, college athletes get 

daily testing while regular 
undergraduate 
students 

more or less had to prove to 
University 
Health 
Service 

that 
someone 
who 
tested 

positive coughed in their 
mouth. To me, that’s not 
the issue. Frontline workers 
should get frequent testing; 
they’re putting their bodies 
on the line after all. The 
issue is that we continue 
to 
pretend 
that 
college 

athletes are just like regular 
undergraduates, 
just 
in 

better shape and with honed 
athletic talents. They aren’t. 
They are essential workers to 
the University, as evidenced 
by their exception to the 
county health department’s 
order. 

But if we call them what 

they are, the jig is up. It’s 
one thing to admit that the 
grocery store and its workers 
are 
essential. 
It’s 
quite 

another to say that a football 
game, executed by unpaid 
athletes 
who 
earn 
their 

schools millions in exchange 
for a degree worth much 
less, is an essential service 
in the midst of a global 
health crisis. It certainly 
would make tailgating, even 
from home, less appealing 
if we reframed the game as 
watching essential workers 
risk debilitating, even life-
threatening 
illness 
(in 

addition to the risk of injury 
they take every game) for the 
purpose 
of 
entertainment 

and the University’s bottom 
line. 

Some 36 years after Byers 

called for an end to the 
system he created, major 
news outlets largely continue 
to keep up the charade that 
college athletes are students 
first. The Daily Tar Heel, the 
University of North Carolina 
at 
Chapel 
Hill’s 
student 

newspaper, 
finally 
had 

enough this year, announcing 
that they would no longer 
refer to college athletes as 
“student-athletes.” 
They 

will use “college athletes” 
or 
simply 
“athletes” 
or 

“students,” depending on the 
situation. These days, allow 
me 
to 
suggest 
“essential 

workers.” Is a change in 
terminology a solution to 
the blatant exploitation of 
college athletes for profit? 
No. But saying the quiet part 
out loud is a start.

Call them what they are: “Student-athletes” 

are essential workers

A

fter the stay-in-place order 
went into effect Oct. 20, 
the University of Michigan 

made the New York Times. The 
“Leaders and Best” had contributed 
to a full-on outbreak of COVID-
19 in Washtenaw County, and 
the undergraduate students were 
potentially to blame.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel tried last week to completely 
absolve himself and the rest of the 
University administration of blame 
for the outbreak. I’m not surprised 
by the University’s unwillingness 
to admit responsibility for their 
failed reopening plans. According to 
them, it’s neither the lack of testing 
and contact tracing nor the lack of 
enforcement of the arbitrary rules 
that they have created. It’s our — the 
undergraduates’ — fault, the same 
students who will end up paying 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to a 
university that doesn’t care. 

When the Graduate Employees’ 

Organization 
went 
on 
strike 

because the University refused to 
meet any of its demands, it was the 
students who suffered, graduate 
and undergraduate alike, when our 
classes were canceled. Once again, 
this stay-in-place order hurts the 
undergrads academically as our few 
remaining in-person classes have 
been moved entirely online. 

While undergrads acknowledge 

that we hold a lot of the responsibility 
for spreading the virus, it was 
the University that put us into an 
environment where we could not 
thrive or make the right decisions. 
Speaking anecdotally, I’ve suffered 
Zoom fatigue from weeks’ worth 
of virtual classes, constant stress 
over looming assignments and a 
frequent loss of focus after staring at 
my computer for hours. I’m sure I’m 
not alone in saying that I’ve made 
risky decisions to hang out with 
friends because I needed the social 
interaction to sustain my mental 
health.

The University has exempted 

student-athletes from the stay-
in-place order because of their 
low percentage of positive cases. 
This is obviously because student-
athletes 
are 
routinely 
tested 

asymptomatically. It is clear where 
the priorities of this administration 
lie — in the students that they can 
profit off of. If they can test our 
athletes, they can test the rest of our 
students. 

Other universities of similar 

capacity, like the University of 
Illinois, have tested their students 
twice weekly since the start of school. 
If one can diagnose and monitor 
cases before they have a chance 
to infect others, the magnitude of 

community spread will be lower, as 
we have seen in student-athletes 
here at the University. As the 
best research institution in the 
country, it is embarrassing, to say 
the least, that only a small fraction 
of the student body has had access 
to asymptomatic testing.

I love my school because 

of 
my 
supportive 
Graduate 

Student Instructors and amazing 
professors, and it’s whereI’ve 
met some of my very best friends. 
We are not the ones failing the 
University — the administration, 
specifically Schlissel, has failed 
us. We grew up in the wake of 
9/11, the rise of school shootings 
and now, we are living through a 
pandemic. 

Standing up to this University’s 

administration isn’t going to 
intimidate us. It’s time to be vocal. 
Tell your professors how you feel. 
Contact Provost Susan M. Collins 
expressing your concern. We are 
past due for real, lasting change 
from the top down. Schlissel 
needs to go before his lack of 
leadership 
and 
incompetence 

drag us down with him.

Who is really to blame for the outbreak?

W

hen 
I 
went 
to 

Traverse City, Mich., 
this past March to 

visit my grandparents, I was 
amazed by the beauty of Old 
Mission Peninsula. The green 
and orange leaves of the apple 
and cherry orchards line a 
landscape of rolling hills that 
provided me with a 360-degree 
view of Grand Traverse Bay. 
Rustic, 
red 
farmhouses 
and 

19th century cottages made the 
landscape even more idyllic. The 
Old Mission Lighthouse that sits 
at the tip of the peninsula gave 
me a view of Lake Michigan 
that stretched over the horizon. 
Few places, outside of national 
parks, have such awe-inspiring 
vistas. Dotting the yards of the 
homes lying on the lakefront, a 
bright green yard-sign managed 
to draw my attention away from 
the sweeping sight. The sign 
called for an end to the Line 5 oil 
pipeline, which transports crude 
oil through Michigan and into 
Canada: a topic I had heard about 
enough in my classes to have 
formed a knowledgeable opinion. 

Run by Enbridge Inc., this 

pipeline has already leaked up 
to a million gallons of oil into 
the Kalamazoo River in 2010. 
The section of the pipeline that 
worries the citizens of the Grand 
Traverse Bay area is located on 
the floor of Lake Michigan as it 
snakes its way across the straits 
of Mackinac. Due to repeated 
damage from anchoring vessels 
in recent years and the risk of 
a disastrous oil spill, there has 
been a push to shut down the 
pipeline. This reached a fever 
pitch soon after my trip, when 
Attorney General Dana Nessel 
filed a motion to shut down the 
pipeline, continuing a years-
long battle between Michigan 
and Enbridge. This challenge 
is just another example of the 
widespread pushback that often 
confronts oil pipelines and the 
risks that come with them. 

Opposition against pipelines 

has taken various forms, with 
northern Michiganders being 
able to express their will using 
political 
influence. 
Tribal 

nations standing against the 
Dakota Access Pipeline have 
faced physical violence in their 
fight against pollution. Police 
even shot protestors with water 
cannons to induce hypothermia 

on freezing nights. People do not 
want rivers of oil running through 
their 
communities, 
despite 

pipelines actually being the safest 
method of oil transportation, 
because no matter which form 
oil is moved in, it will always 
threaten our environment and 
our communities. Even so, the 
worrisome effects of pipelines 
pale in comparison to the deadly 
consequences of their railway 
alternative. 

In 1951, deep under the 

plains of North Dakota, over 18 
billion barrels’ worth of crude 
oil was discovered. Unable to 
extract it due to technology 
limitations, these Bakken shale 
oil fields sat dormant for the 
remainder of the century. In 
2008, however, a new method 
of drilling, hydraulic fracking, 
allowed the once inaccessible 
oil 
to 
be 
extracted 
with 

relative ease. This sparked 
the “North Dakota Oil Boom” 
which made North Dakota the 
second largest oil producer in 
the United States by 2015. Oil 
companies decided to use the 
nation’s railways to transport 
the immense amount of crude 
oil being extracted to coastal 
refineries — in 2008, there 
were 9,500 rail cars moving 
crude oil, and by 2014 there 
were over 400,000.

DOT-11 tanker cars, many 

developed to transport corn 
syrup, 
were 
often 
loaded 

full of thousands of gallons 
of highly flammable crude 
oil 
and 
shipped 
through 

American cities. With such 
a rapid acceleration in the 
usage of this new means of oil 
transportation, little oversight 
was applied to the dubious 
practice. Overall, derailments 
of these tankers have caused 
over 3,272 evacuations, spilled 
almost 
2.8 
million 
gallons 

of oil and cost an estimated 
$45 million in damages and 
cleanup. Oil train derailments, 
however, can have even more 
deadly 
consequences, 
as 
it 

is not only a risky way to 
transport the material, but 
also utilizes trains which are 
not designed for products this 
flammable. When a tanker is 
breached, massive fire spouts 
erupt that burn for days and often 
ignite the other tanks around 
them in a fiery chain reaction. 

The explosive potential of this 
concoction of natural gas and oil 
parallels even the most brutal 
weapons of war. 

On a late summer night in 

2013, 72 DOT-11 tank cars filled 
with Bakken shale oil derailed 
in the center of the city of Lac-
Megantic, Canada, exhibiting 
this destructive potential. A 
crowded bar was pulverized 
instantly by the blast as 27 tank 
cars ran off the tracks at around 
60 miles per hour, killing 47 
people. The city was consumed 
by this inferno for days as 
firefighters waited helplessly for 
the oil to finish burning. The loss 
of 100,000 liters of oil into local 
rivers also left a toxic aftermath 
that is still confronting the town 
to this day.

While this pushed Canada’s 

government to pass regulations 
regulating DOT-11 tank cars, 
these cars are still allowed to 
travel throughout the U.S. with 
no extra safety precautions until 
2023. The black tanker cars 
that stream into many major 
American cities on a daily basis, 
from Chicago to Omaha, Neb., are 
disasters waiting to happen. Oil 
transportation providing a wide 
variety of unsavory and deadly 
consequences is yet another reason 
that our dependency on fossil fuels 
must be curbed. 

When I made my way into 

downtown Ann Arbor after my 
trip to Old Mission Peninsula, 
I saw a line of black oil tankers 
sitting on the railroad tracks 
near the Big House. I wondered, 
if the people of Ann Arbor knew 
about the potential infernos being 
shipped through town, would they 
too have yard signs calling for their 
banning? With each tanker capable 
of causing massive explosions in 
any of the cities they roll through, 
some of America’s most densely 
populated cities are at risk of 
a 
fiery, 
industrial 
disaster. 

While railroad companies and 
Republican legislators may be 
fine with hoping for the best 
until 2023, with the string of bad 
luck this new decade has already 
wrought, that’s not a bet I would 
like to take.

Last line of defense

A

s we have seen out west 
and on the Gulf Coast, 
the effects of climate 

change are already impacting 
our everyday lives. As forest fires, 
hurricanes and other climate-
related disasters become more 
frequent, the likelihood of the 
government being able to help 
local 
communities 
decreases 

exponentially. We have already 
seen governments fail to protect 
their 
citizens 
during 
major 

hurricanes and in major health 
crises throughout the COVID-
19 pandemic. When a crisis 
occurs and governments are 
nowhere to be found, it is up to 
each community to organize 
itself in order to survive. Climate 
change makes it more likely that 
a disaster will strike in your area, 
but a strong community can 
withstand any crisis. 

In late October of 2012, walking 

around my neighborhood of Red 
Hook, Brooklyn in New York City 
felt surreal. Stores and houses 
were boarded up. Fallen trees lay 
across streets and on electrical 
wires. There was a boat in the 
middle of a road. Soaked books 
and clothes littered the sidewalks. 
Hurricane Sandy had devastated 
the area, killing 48 and causing 
more than $70 billion in damages, 
and the small neighborhood of 
Red Hook in South Brooklyn was 
one of the hardest hit. With its long 
coastline on New York Harbor 
and its low elevation, much of the 
neighborhood was flooded. Red 
Hook residents were left with 
nothing, particularly those living 
in public housing, who were left 
without heat for the winter. Both 
city and state governments were 
slow to aid those who needed it 
most, leaving communities to 
fend for themselves. 

Following 
the 
breakup 
of 

Occupy Wall Street, a protest 
movement 
against 
growing 

income inequality, participants 
reconvened for a new mission. 
A group, Occupy Sandy, set up 
distribution hubs to allocate food 

and equipment and organized 
teams to clear debris and clean out 
neighbors’ basements. In a time of 
chaos and uncertainty, it was the 
strength of the community that 
brought the residents out of the 
crisis — without any help from the 
government. 

This same sense of community 

self-sufficiency was seen in New 
Orleans during the aftermath of 
Hurricane Katrina. Scott Crow, 
an anarchist organizer from 
Texas, went to New Orleans 
to look for his friend, whom 
he hadn’t heard from since the 
storm hit. He was dumbfounded 
by the lack of aid from the local, 
state and federal governments. 
Last year on a podcast, Crow said 
that he “saw the inefficiency of 
capitalism or governments in 
general, but (he) also saw the 
inefficiency of corporations to 
do anything about this,” leaving 
people with no choice but to fend 
for themselves. 

This prompted Crow, along 

with his friend and former Black 
Panther, Robert King, and a 
small group of locals to begin 
organizing to provide neighbors 
with food, health care, shelter 
and community defense. The 
community organizing expanded 
— and turned into something 
quite different than the usual 
post-disaster intervention. Crow 
said that his group wanted to 
“not just [try] to provide charity 
and support for people in that 
way that everyone does because 
everyone could see that there 
was a disaster … we wanted to use 
it as a pivoting point to rebuild 
neighborhoods block by block, 
neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Not in our image but in the image 
of what the people want.” 

The 
organization 
became 

known as the Common Ground 
Collective 
and 
adopted 
the 

inspiring 
slogan 
“solidarity 

not charity” in an attempt to 
emphasize its nonhierarchical, 
community-led structure. When 
New Orleans citizens needed 

their government most, it was 
nowhere to be found — it was 
rather the community, catalyzed 
by Crow and his group, that 
uplifted those who most needed 
help in the middle of a disaster. 

The 
COVID-19 
pandemic 

has taken the lives of more 
than 220,000 Americans while 
devastating the economy and 
leaving millions jobless, once 
again 
putting 
pressure 
on 

community organizing. In our 
backyard 
in 
Michigan, 
local 

organizers in Ann Arbor and 
Ypsilanti launched Washtenaw 
County Mutual Aid. Beginning in 
March, this group grew to more 
than 4,000 members helping with 
food distribution, rent payments 
and running errands for those 
who are immunocompromised. 
The 
mutual 
aid 
network 

complemented 
existing 
aid 

organizations 
and 
structures, 

bringing them together and 
making it easier for those who 
were struggling to find help. 

While 
Washtenaw 
County 

Mutual Aid no longer exists, 
there are still ways to help others 
in our community. As hundreds 
of students test positive for 
COVID-19, 
myself 
included, 

the question of mutual aid is no 
longer abstract or some historical 
curiosity. This is something that 
we should do for each other right 
now. If you’re sick, take care of 
yourself, but if you’re healthy 
take care of your community 
while still following the stay-in-
place order guidelines. Offer to 
run to the grocery store and leave 
food on a friend’s porch. People 
are feeling isolated and scared, so 
check in on your friends and offer 
them support. In short, be there 
for each other. We must follow 
the experts and trust science, 
but we must also organize and 
strengthen 
our 
communities 

because, in the end, nobody is 
coming to save us.

eight Stigma Awareness 
Week 
happened 

recently, and its call 

for everyone, not just those in larger 
bodies, to understand why weight 
stigma is important moved me to 
use this platform to portray the 
issue. And what better example of 
how weight stigma has hurt those 
in larger bodies than its infiltration 
into the COVID-19 risk factors. The 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has asserted that people 
categorized as “obese” by body mass 
index standards are at increased risk 
of falling ill from COVID-19. 

But a look beyond the coveted 

CDC-label and into the research 
shows that these are preliminary 
findings at best and, on the whole, 
based on weak evidence. When 
organizations like the CDC and 
media outlets boast that higher-
weight individuals are specifically 
in danger of contracting COVID-19, 
they only point to three preliminary 
reports released since April that cite 
high BMI as a risk factor.

The first report overstates the 

percentage of “obese” patients 
by failing to also state that the 
percentage of individuals in this 
category in the United States is 
comparable, and could thus be a 
proportionate representation. The 
second report found that those with 
a BMI above 35 were more likely to 
be put on a ventilator, and the third 
report was a preliminary finding 
that those with a BMI over 30 have 
a higher risk of hospitalization and 
intensive-care admission if they’re 
less than 60 years old. Weight didn’t 
appear important for those above 60. 

Yet all of these are flawed in 

that they don’t control for social 
determinants of health, such as race, 
socioeconomic status and quality of 
care. These determinants are born 
out of structural racism and weight 
stigma is their sibling. The social 
determinants of health are a branch 
of the many systems of oppressions 
with us today, all of which are 
rooted in slavery, discrimination 
and 
racism. 
The 
system 
of 

oppression that is most at play in 
this particular case pertaining to 
COVID-19 is the health care system 
that 
disproportionately 
neglects 

the Black community and people 
of color, not necessarily because 
those working in it are explicitly 
racist, but because they exist under 
structurally racist systems. 

For a better understanding of 

these 
determinants, 
it’s 
worth 

examining the redlining policies 
that concentrated Black people into 
communities with limited access to 
quality health care, not to mention 
foods with highly nutritious profiles. 
Policies like these paved the way for 
health disparities, and by virtue of 
doing this covertly, they’ve also left 
room to allocate individual blame. 

Thus, “poor lifestyle choices” 

cannot be blamed for health 
disparities, like those in COVID-19 
where Black individuals have had 
the highest rates of complications 
and death from the virus. Evoking 
an individual-focused argument 
does great harm by dismissing 
and excusing the racist structure 
that has fostered it. Weight stigma 
feeds on this dismissal and excusal, 
and stigma towards larger-bodied 
individuals becomes an accepted 
social norm. Doctors’ failure to 
provide adequate care and instead 
assert that an individual’s weight 
is the root of their problem, and 
proceed to prescribe weight loss, 
is a great example of this stigma 
in a medical setting. In everyday 
society, stigma takes many forms, 
from outright telling someone to lose 
weight because you think you care 
about them to sneering at a larger-
bodied individual at the gym. 

Nonetheless, a new study of more 

than ten thousand individuals with 
the virus found that high BMI was 
not a risk factor for hospitalization, 
ventilation or mortality. I learned of 
this study through a great podcast, 
Food Psych, that discussed weight 
stigma and its disproportionate 
effect on the Black community and 
people of color, where the social 
determinants of health I mentioned 
earlier are the main predictors of 
future health outcomes. Contrary 
to what some are led to believe 
by 
sources 
highlighting 
the 

disproportionate rates of illness 
and death by the virus in the Black 
community, the virus does not 
discriminate. 
The 
health 
care 

system, on the other hand, most 
definitely does, and that’s why we 
have such stark disparities in the 
demographics of those who contract 
the virus. It has nothing to do with 
race, because the color of your 
skin does not make you inherently 
more susceptible to the virus, yet 
it has everything to do with race, 
in 
that 
minority 
communities 

have been severely limited in their 
access to quality care. And because 
the prevalence of higher BMIs 
in minority communities is well-
established, it’s easy for our society 
— medical professionals included — 
to resort to weight stigma and place 
blame for a systematic problem on 
individuals. 

Patrilie Hernandez, an Early 

Childhood Nutrition & Health 
Specialist and the founder of 
Embody Lib, was the guest on Food 
Psych that beautifully articulated 
how individual responsibility is 
skewed. “I’m not trying to say 
that our individual choices do not 
matter,” she started. “They do. And 
when it comes to lifestyle, sure they 
matter, but they only really start to 
matter when it comes to our health, 
when we’re free from the restraints 

of all these systems that create the 
health disparities.” I couldn’t have 
said it better myself.

At this point in time, we can’t say 

definitely that a higher body weight 
is the reason an individual becomes 
infected or further falls very ill with 
the virus when there are so many 
other factors in place. If my POLSCI 
300 class has taught me anything, it’s 
that substantive conclusions cannot 
be made when other confounding 
variables aren’t accounted for. And 
here, the confounding variables that 
are the various social determinants 
of health are complex and not 
accounted for in these studies. 
Moreover, the studies we do have on 
weight stigma right now continue to 
suggest that the stigma itself does 
the most harm.

Still, let’s say we were to believe 

that a higher body weight in itself 
put someone at a heightened risk 
for COVID-19. What can be done 
as a result? We know for a fact that 
diets don’t work, with most of the 
lost weight being regained within 
five years and sometimes even more 
weight gain than what was originally 
lost. So you can’t tell people to just 
lose weight because that implies 
intentionally restricting food, and 
that is a diet. So, what’s the next step? 
Unless the goal is weight cycling, 
which is known to be harmful, a 
restrictive diet is not the answer. 

In the end, the answer is still 

then to adopt healthy behaviors, 
regardless of current weight and 
without weight loss goals. But that’s 
on an individual level. You can’t 
run before you learn how to walk. 
The 
overarching, 
multifaceted 

problem is still weight stigma, the 
harm it brings to people in larger 
bodies by limiting their access to 
high-quality health care — and its 
parent, systematic racism born out 
of centuries of racism.

I’m not stating definitively that a 

higher weight doesn’t increase your 
risk of contracting and falling ill to 
COVID-19. It very well could. But the 
outright claims that it does — that an 
“obese” BMI increases your risk — 
is unsubstantiated right now. And 
again, if it does, that puts individuals 
in larger bodies between a rock and a 
hard place because it is also true that 
intentional weight loss efforts are a 
fruitless endeavor most of the time. 
In fact, weight cycling or weight gain 
past the individual’s initial starting 
weight are likely going to be the long-
term results. Finally, all this focus on 
weight as a risk factor, and weight 
loss to correct for it, allows weight 
stigma to continue to fly under the 
radar, and the social determinants 
of health continue to be reproduced 
the longer we continue to neglect its 
racist roots.

hought to be the only 
non-Iranian 
dual-

national 
currently 

imprisoned 
by 
the 
Iranian 

government, Kylie Moore-Gilbert 
has been Iranian custody since 
2019. Moore-Gilbert, a British-
Australian citizen, was a lecturer 
in Islamic studies at Melbourne 
University, where she specialized 
in politics, authoritarianism and 
popular movements in the Arab 
Gulf region. She was detained 
while traveling in Iran under 
accusations of espionage without 
any public disclosure of evidence 
for her alleged crimes. The 
Australian government described 
her detention as baseless and 
politically-motivated, 
which 

goes along with human rights 
advocates 
accusing 
Iran 
of 

routinely 
arresting 
innocent 

foreign nationals and holding 
them 
hostage 
for 
political 

purposes.

Multiple 
reports 
of 

mistreatment 
and 
abuse 

surfaced during the first two 
years of Moore-Gilbert’s 10-year 
sentence at Iran’s Evin Prison. 
Moore-Gilbert was beaten by 
prison guards after forming 
a prison choir as an act of 
resistance 
to 
her 
detention. 

Sources also stated that Moore-
Gilbert received treatment for 
injuries on her arms, along 
with severe bruising across her 
entire body. The husband of 
recently-freed Iranian detainee 
Nazanin 
Zaghari-Ratcliffe 

alleged that Moore-Gilbert was 
held in solitary confinement “at 
a level of abuse that’s beyond 
egregious.” 

While held in Evin, Moore-
Gilbert 
was 
offered 
her 

release on the condition that 
she would work as a spy for the 
terrorist Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard Corps. Letters reveal that 
Moore-Gilbert furiously denied 
the offer, writing, “I am not a 

spy. I have never been a spy and 
I have no interest to work for 
a spying organization in any 
country. When I leave Iran, I 
want to be a free woman and live 
a free life, not under the shadow 
of extortion and threats.”

In July 2020, Moore-Gilbert’s 

situation became even more 
dire as she was transferred 
to 
Iran’s 
notorious 
Qarchak 

Prison for women, which the 
U.S. State Department describes 
as an institution responsible 
for extrajudicial killings and 
torture. Human rights groups 
have 
detailed 
the 
prison’s 

deplorable conditions including 
overflows 
of 
raw 
sewage, 

inedible food and undrinkable 
water. 
Additionally, 
as 
Iran 

maintains its status as one of 
the 
most 
COVID-19-stricken 

nations in the world, sources 
have 
claimed 
that 
Qarchak 

regularly has disease outbreaks. 
Moore-Gilbert reportedly was at 
one point extremely physically 
ill, with a fellow prisoner saying, 
“after one meal she became 
sick. Kylie was terrified of the 
officers… she left me in tears 
and anxious. In a publicized 
recording, an exasperated Kylie 
can be heard saying, “I can’t 
eat anything. I feel so very 
hopeless… I am so depressed.”

News of political hostage-

taking has become a familiar 
occurrence in the West in recent 
years, especially in America. 
Most recently, Americans were 
subject to the dramatic and 
tragic story of Otto Warmbier. 
In January of 2016, Warmbier 
was 
detained 
by 
North 

Korean officials for allegedly 
stealing a poster in his hotel in 
Pyongyang, North Korea and 
was subsequently sentenced to 
15 years of physical labor. Images 
and videos of distraught and 
pale Warmbier, accompanied by 
public outcry, brought the Trump 

administration’s 
attention 
to 

the 
case, 
eventually 
ending 

with 
Warmbier’s 
release 
on 

humanitarian grounds.

Horrifically, Warmbier was 

released in a comatose state and 
subsequently 
died. 
Officials 

claimed that he had suffered 
from a case of botulism despite 
extensive 
evidence 
that 
he 

was a subject of beatings or 
torture. Warmbier’s father, Fred 
Warmbier, said in a declaration 
to a U.S. federal court, “it is 
unbelievable to me that North 
Korea would send Otto home as a 
vegetable, with scars on his body 
and crooked teeth.”

As with Warmbier’s case, 

Moore-Gilbert’s 
detention 

is 
completely 
baseless. 

Authoritarian regimes like those 
of North Korea and Iran continue 
to use the lives of innocent free-
world citizens as pawns for 
political gain, often torturing 
their 
victims 
psychologically 

and 
physically, 
and 
in 

Warmbier’s case, signing their 
death sentence. As Australia’s 
relationship with Iran becomes 
more strained, especially due to 
Australia’s troop commitment 
to the U.S. coalition in Iraq, the 
Australian government’s quiet 
diplomatic approach to securing 
Moore-Gilbert’s freedom has 
resoundingly failed.

Moore-Gilbert’s 
case 
is 

of particular concern as her 
imprisonment 
represents 

an 
increasingly 
hostile 

environment 
for 
researchers 

and academics with focuses on 
authoritarianism. 
The 
world 

must hear her plea for help, “I 
am entirely alone in Iran. I have 
no friends or family here and in 
addition to all the pain I have 
endured here, I feel like I am 
abandoned and forgotten.”

hile I tried to ignore 
the reality for as 
long as possible, I 

recently forced myself to face 
my addiction: social media. For 
many years I have been a user of 
Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, 
VSCO and now TikTok. It never 
felt as though I used these 
applications more than any of my 
peers. I would try to not be on 
my phone when around friends. 
The only exceptions were when 
I wanted to upload a Snapchat 
selfie or some event occurred 
that required me to instantly look 
at my phone so my Instagram or 
Snapchat stories would be in 
better view.

My life didn’t seem to revolve 

around 
social 
media 
posts, 

except for when casually hanging 
out with friends would turn into 
hour-long photo-taking sessions 
for Instagram. These would be 
followed by an hour-long session 
of staring at our phones editing, 
posting and checking to see if 
people had commented on the 
new shirts we were so excited 
about wearing, or if our bodies fit 
a certain beauty standard or if we 
looked like we were “thriving.”

From where I stood, I couldn’t 

pinpoint a way social media was 
making my life worse. My grades 
were good. I had plenty of friends 
and healthy relationships. It 
seemed that the anxieties over 
feeling left out, body image 
issues, validation from peers and 
whether or not his “Snap score” 
increased while he still hadn’t 
responded for hours were normal 
stresses that all my friends 
experienced. 

Whenever I pondered if my 

social media use was bad for 
my mental health, I concluded 
that not having it would be 
worse because I might lose 
my 
connections 
with 
long-

distance friendships, relate less 
to friends and family that were 
experiencing the same things 
online and lose my platform 
where I was able to prove that 
I was “living my best life” to 
almost 2,000 people, most of 
which I would probably never see 
or speak to. 

Then 
I 
went 
public. 
On 

Instagram, there is a feature 
where 
you 
can 
make 
your 

public 
account 
a 
“business 

account” and get access to how 
many people are viewing your 
account, saving your pictures, 
direct-messaging your pictures 
and more. While I have usually 
considered myself a generally 

down-to-earth person, I found 
myself 
impulsively 
checking 

these statistics whenever I would 
post. The rabbit hole would only 
deepen as I would find myself 
checking who had liked certain 
things, viewed different stories or 
more importantly, who hadn’t. 

Chamath Palihapitiya, former 

vice president of growth at 
Facebook, says in his interview 
in the Netflix documentary “The 
Social 
Dilemma” 
that 
social 

media apps are designed to 
“psychologically figure out how to 
manipulate you as fast as possible, 
and then give you back that 
dopamine hit,” regardless of if we 
realize we are falling into the trap 
or not. The validation of a like, 
comment, tag or direct message 
may entice you to constantly 
check the app in search of those 
dopamine hits. 

Around two weeks ago, I 

realized that I was no longer 
living for myself. I felt pressure 
to exercise and look fit so that 
people wouldn’t comment on my 
weight. I wanted to have my social 
media feeds be full of pictures 
with friends and smiles to ensure 
my followers that my social life 
is thriving. It felt good when 50 
people would take the time to 
comment on my pictures about 
how amazing I was. I thought 
that Instagram was helping 
me build my self-confidence by 
allowing me to show off my life 
and feel proud. 

While posts do achieve this 

self-confidence 
boost 
to 
an 

extent, I started to question 
why receiving this validation 
in person from the people I see 
and am currently friends with 
isn’t enough. How is a like from 
my elementary school crush or 
my middle school ex-best friend 
impacting me? All that should 
matter is how I feel about myself. 
Why am I letting the actions and 
opinions of anyone but myself 
impact my emotions and self-
esteem?

In an attempt to decide what 

I wanted to do going forward 
with my social media accounts, 
I deleted the Instagram app for 
a week. The number of times 
I went onto my phone and 
subconsciously looked for the 
app shocked me. I didn’t think 
I checked the app that many 
times a day. While it felt freeing 
to be Instagram-free for a week, 
I didn’t feel truly free knowing 
that my account was still out 
there for strangers to view and 
judge.

Tristan Harris, the former 

design ethicist at Google and 
co-founder for the Centre for 
Humane Technologies, explains 
in his “The Social Dilemma” 
interview, “Social media starts 
to dig deeper and deeper down 
into the brain stem and take over 
kids’ sense of self-worth and 
identity.” While I told myself I 
was using Instagram to express 
myself and feel confident, it 
began to feel like my account 
was an entirely separate identity 
I had to maintain. 

Amidst 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic, social circles have 
shrunk. Many individuals are 
only spending time with their 
closest friends and not meeting 
many 
new 
people. 
People 

are now solely making their 
judgments and impressions off 
of social media and pictures. I 
realized people aren’t meeting 
me and getting to know me right 
now — they are only judging 
from a feed of pictures and 
cheesy captions on a small phone 
screen. The ability of others to 
form judgements of me from 
my posts and not their actual 
interactions with me bothered 
me. 

So, I deleted my account 

entirely and started over. My 
new account has around 100 
followers, 
made 
entirely 
of 

people I respect, know and 
can call friends. While I still 
find myself checking the app 
throughout the day, there is no 
longer a rabbit hole to fall into. 
While challenging, I cut out 
any followers that may impact 
my emotions or mental health. 
It is tempting to give in to the 
validation and attention search 
that social media is programmed 
to make you crave. 

What is scary about the social 

media dilemma is that we do 
not usually realize how deeply it 
impacts us. Social media is not 
considered a serious addiction 
that needs to be addressed, since 
everyone is suffering from the 
same addiction. However, the 
harm it causes to mental health, 
relationships and self-identity 
are real and substantial. I urge 
all users of social media to take 
a break, reflect on how your 
life is controlled or impacted by 
social media and take steps to 
acknowledge the social media 
dilemma and break free from its 
grip on society.

THE B-SIDE: COMFORT
The reasons that we’re 
still watching television

They put TVs in hospital rooms. 
You don’t think twice about it while 
you’re there, probably because 
you’re 
distracted 
by 
whatever 
reason you’re there in the first place. 
The wall-mounted, boxy television 
set perches in the corner of a bare 
room reeking of antiseptic and 
bodily fluid. Sometimes it’s tuned 
into a generic game show with a 
host that tries his best to mimic a 
more charismatic person. Or it plays 
the kind of daytime soap opera that 
exists only to be background noise 
to drown out the silence between 
the beeps of heart rate monitors and 
IV drips. 
It sits, and it watches. It sees you 
hunched over in a plastic chair with 
just enough padding to prevent 
complaints. It sees you hunched 
over and fighting back tears and the 
bone-aching heaves that come with 
desperation and grief. It sees you 
propped up on pillows with a needle 
in your arm and stickers on your 
chest that leave a gooey residue that 
won’t go away after three showers. 
It sees you dazedly lifting up your 
arm for the nurse to take your vital 
signs in the middle of the night. It 
sees a doctor point at a chart of a 
pain scale from zero to ten with little 
cartoon faces beneath the numbers 
because they know you’re hurting 
and demand you tell them just how 
much.
There is a TV above you, and the 
sound is off. You don’t always need 
to hear it to know it’s there. It will 
always be there, no matter how 
many familiar faces and complete 
strangers come and go. In fact, it’s 
one of the few pieces of hospital 
furniture that doesn’t come with 
wheels for trips up and down the 
wide, cavernous elevators. Of all the 
things to bolt into the wall of a room 
no one wants to be in, they chose a 
TV. They put TVs in hospital rooms 
because they know you need it.

If movies represent the spectacle 
of show business, the magnitude of 
blockbusters, the insane celebrity 
of its stars, TV represents all things 
small. A miniature version of the 
silver screen, television arrived in 
homes and quickly replaced the 
radio as the hearth of the house. 
Furniture was arranged around a 
grainy black and white screen and 
stayed there indefinitely. Instead 
of intimate fireside chats with 
President Roosevelt, Americans 
of the early 1950s tuned in to 
reassuring domestic sitcoms like 
“Mary Kay and Johnny” and “I 
Love Lucy.” As a formal update of 
the radio, the TV had to prove itself 
valuable in the lives of consumers. 
Rather than opt for the theatrics 
of cinema, television burrowed 
its way into the daily routine 
of the country and offered a 
constant stream of content into the 
home. News broadcasts, comedy 
and variety shows and talent 
competitions gave television a broad 
range for appealing to every member 
of the family. And at the time, there 
was nothing more important than 
protecting the American nuclear 
family. The TV forced itself into the 
home until it became a fixture so 
permanent, no one could consider 
it anything but essential. The 
attachment that the American 
public felt to the television laid the 
foundation for an entire media 
industry built upon an unspoken 
trust between the consumer and the 
consumed. 
The images on the TV screen 
reflected the desires of the people 
who watched it. Light entertainment 
about everyday American life has 
remained a constant since the days 
of “I Love Lucy,” partially because 
the post-war “return to normalcy” 
period never really ended. In the 
1960s, audiences could flip between 
the civil rights movement to “The 
Andy Griffith Show” to the newest 
casualties of Vietnam. With more 
access to information, more viewers 
demanded to see who they were, 

who they wanted to be and how 
their country fit into the same 
rabbit-eared box that a family like 
theirs could. The smaller scale of 
the TV widened the scope of what 
audiences saw as belonging to them. 
The television gave the people 
ownership of an entire medium. It 
was built for them, targeted at them, 
so fundamentally connected to their 
lives that it created a new, more 
intimate relationship with viewers. 
That 
intimacy 
has 
only 
strengthened over time. Despite its 
many technological competitors for 
America’s attention, the television 
still remains the center of our homes. 
The couches still face the screen, 
whether it’s playing Netflix or cable. 
The advent of streaming services has 
only increased its presence in pop 
culture because now nearly every 
program is available somewhere for 
you to rewatch over and over again. 
Unlike movies, TV shows have 
hours of content to feed its audience; 
you don’t have to stop watching. It 
doesn’t have to end. It will always be 
there, sitting patiently on its stand 
in the center of your living room, 
waiting for you to come home. 
You lift the remote to your TV and 
see the nurse call button just below 
the volume adjuster. There’s nothing 
on, but there’s always something on, 
so you start scrolling through the 
channels. You flip to “SpongeBob 
SquarePants” and laugh at a stupid 
starfish who lives under a rock. It’s 
the funniest thing you’ve ever seen, 
or at least it feels that way right 
now. You flip to “The Office” and 
realize you’d still rather be here 
than at work where your boss makes 
Michael Scott look like a genius. You 
flip to “M.A.S.H.” because you want 
to remember what it was like when 
you were a child and could look up to 
brave doctors with good hearts and 
half as much paperwork as the ones 
making their rounds to your room.

THE B-SIDE: COMFORT
Dancing in the moonlight 
with strangers on campus

It is comforting to think that 
despite 
everything 
that 
has 
changed, the twilight hours of my 
college career arrive just as my first 
taste of adulthood started three 
years ago: with a dance. 
Full-of-myself, 
eager 
and 
incredibly naive, the person I was in 
the fall of 2018 seems like a stranger 
in some aspects. By the time the 
move-in flurry of activity had boiled 
down to a familiar routine, the fall 
chill had already set in. At the time, 
only seventeen, I felt untethered. 
Adrift and far from home, I didn’t 
know how to anchor myself back 
to the Earth. I was an adult — but at 
the same time, not really. 
Suffice 
to 
say, 
college 
independence didn’t meld with my 
teenage reality until months after 
my official “arrival.” I always like 
to say that college really started one 
Wednesday evening in October. 
It was freezing, but then again, 
Michigan always is. It was freezing, 
dark and nearing midnight, but 
we didn’t care. No, buoyed by the 
euphoria of a night spent swing 
dancing in the warm, heated 
ballrooms of the Michigan League, 
the cold was more than tolerable. 
My friend and I leaned against each 
other, drunk on shared happiness. 
Hours spent twirling and whirling 
the night away left us on unsteady 
feet. It was the happiest I had felt in 
a long time.
We danced our way home, too. 
Triple-stepping our way down 
the Ingalls Mall avenue; spinning 
around street lamps in imitation of 
“Singing in the Rain”; dancing the 
Charleston on the pavement, on the 
grass, on the stone benches of the 
Diag and down the steps of Hatcher 
Library. In the way only a freshman 
or graduating senior can, we even 
dared to dance teasingly around the 
block “M.” Now, my blood runs cold 
just thinking about it. 
Then, like a gratuitous Hallmark 

movie, out of the darkness appears 
a jogger. A shirtless jogger. A very 
fit, good-looking, shirtless jogger. 
A very fit, very good-looking, 
shirtless and male jogger who, 
against all reason and logic, stopped 
breathlessly to ask: 
“What dance is that? Do you 
know how to do this?” Followed by 
his awkward mime of a completely 
unintelligible dance move. 
Seized by the reckless daring 
only abs and fairytale moonlight 
can bring about, I boldly told him, 
“Just dance it with me, then I’ll 
know.” 
That’s right — I danced with 
the cute, shirtless jogger, under 
the moonlight, at midnight, with 
the Michigan “M” as my witness. 
Then he thanked me, and jogged off 
into the dark. I never did meet that 
jogger again — Jogger-boy, if you’re 
out there, call me. 
Freshman year, you could say, 
started with a bit of a bang, toasted 
by a dance.
Junior year, unfortunately, has 
had a distinct lack of attractive 
joggers (let alone men) to break up 
the monotony of quarantine. You 
can’t have it all, I guess. Junior year 
does, however, have one redeeming 
quality: dancing. 
When the walls of August 
lockdown began to close in, I would 
rescue myself by dancing; When 
the paranoia of the pandemic set 
in, or the fear of America’s political 
future overwhelmed my mind, 
I danced; And when my anxiety 
loomed overhead with sleepless 
nights, itchy skin, grinding teeth 
and tight pain coiled in my chest, I 
knew what would save me. 
So, if you happened across a 
strange girl dancing by herself 
on campus, consider the mystery 
solved. Like clockwork, when the 
sun began to set, I set out to work. 
Some nights, I would stake out a 
spot by the UMMA; Others would 
find me by the diag, or in the hidden 
corners and pathways sequestered 
around campus. Sometimes it was 
visibility that I needed –– to affirm 

to myself that I could still be seen, 
heard, witnessed by someone. 
Occasionally, it was simply me, 
myself and the ‘20s crooning of Fats 
Waller. 
You might wonder why dancing 
is so grounding for me. The simple 
answer is that dance, like other 
artforms, is driven by expression 
— The hops, skips, spins and dips 
of swing act as a conduit to channel 
out the tension, anger and fear that 
builds up.
The longer answer is memory. 
My grandfather, a University alum 
from the ‘50s, once swing danced 
on this very campus. When I 
dance on these same streets, there 
is an undeniable connection and 
sense of relief: The knowledge 
that 
someone 
else 
has 
been 
here before, experienced what I 
have experienced and somehow 
continued on buoys me from 
pessimism and doubt. 
Swing dancing, too, is special 
in itself. From the ‘20s Big Band 
of Tommy Dorsey and Benny 
Goodman to the ‘50s crooners of 
Sinatra and Dean Martin, swing is 
old fashioned, like me. It’s an act of 
indulgence in everything vintage, 
from the songs, to the clothes and 
even the dance-moves. More than 
that, swing is fun. Some of the steps 
have odd names (like “shin splints” 
or the “Charleston”), the acrobatic 
moves can feel circus-like and the 
musicians can be just as humorous 
as any comedian. It’s showbiz, baby. 
Swing dancing, for me, is 
comfort. Even if I do look like 
a crazed cat-lady or ghost of 
Christmas past dancing around 
campus at night. I think, however, 
that during unprecedented times 
like these, we could all use some 
time to let loose, to go out dancing. 
Before I close the final chapter of 
my Michigan years, I’d like to be 
able to end the story with “and 
everybody was dancing in the 
moonlight.”

THE B-SIDE: COMFORT

The B-Side: 
Closing the Penguin Cafe

VIVIAN ISTOMIN
Daily Arts Writer

The only people I’ve shown 
the Penguin Cafe Orchestra to 
are Diana and Stephen. 
Both had vastly different 
reactions. Stephen has really 
taken to it. I’m sure that Diana’s 
forgotten about it by now. I 
didn’t expect Stephen to become 
so preoccupied with their final 
studio album, Union Cafe. I only 
played one song for him out of 
its countless instrumentals, but 
in just 10 days I’ll be teaching 
him how to play “Silver Star of 
Bologna” on piano. 
I know he’s right. There’s just 
something about their music 
that also leaves me so at ease. 
Currents of musical pacification 
are what decorated my mid-
teenage years, after all.
* * *

It’s nice to call back to that 
time. 
Specifically 
the 
early 
mornings 
Diana 
drove 
me 
to school down her chosen 
dirt roads, trading traffic on 
the paved route for an ever-
morphing collection of potholes 
that thumped under our tires. A 
slow hollow wind always pierced 
our ears — something you only 
ever hear in a passenger seat. 
Maybe sounding from the tires. 
Probably from the speed. On 
top of that was whatever I was 
making us listen to on our way. 
Sometimes my face would grow 
hot with embarrassment if it was 
something particularly intense. 
A song by Animal Collective. 
A music video played off of 
YouTube, added sound effects 
still intact. She always had a 
limit to what she would let me 
play. A quick press of a button 
would skip the song or turn the 
volume down to negligible levels. 
She’d make a facetious remark 
as she continued to stare out at 

the back of a car in front of us. 
This was a quiet ritual. We were 
both half-asleep. Even though 
she had run that morning. Even 
though she’d already had two 
cups of coffee. 
I had my eyes closed in the 
darker months. There wasn’t 
much to look at, with a stray 
streetlamp or harsh headlight 
blinding us from behind. I 
wanted to grasp a couple last 

moments of rest before the 
day really began. The early 
autumn months were different, 
though. Rays from the rising 
sun would pierce through a 
deep, multicolored foliage. They 
shined through the thick fog 
that lamely hovered over the 
soccer fields, on the huge grass 
paths beneath electrical lines 
that cut through a small patch 
of forest. I would look out the 
window and just sort of dream, 
imagining 
myself 
following 
those power lines all the way, 
wherever they’d guide me.
A classic adolescent fantasy.

* * *

The Penguin Cafe Orchestra 
has always been an instrumental 
band. Their melodies give me 
peace. They give Stephen peace. 
Diana 
never 
skipped 
their 
music. “Cutting Branches For a 
Temporary Structure” always 
played unabated. We’d sit in 
silence. Like Stephen and I do 
now. I know she had work on her 
mind, what was important for 
that day, where she needed to be. 
But it was a found harmonium, 
a solitary piano that those 
thoughts rested on.
No sleep aides in emptying a 
mind. Formless. Thoughtless. 
“Penguin Cafe Single” carried 
me in my daydreams of escaping 
into nature. It’s like being a 
child, lifted to bed by large 
arms after falling asleep on the 
downstairs couch.
Thoughtless.
It’s nice to pass it on. Or maybe 
just the new memories attaching 
to a band that’s like a forgotten 
friend. Maybe he’ll play “Vega” at 
his wedding. Maybe when I see 
her at the park again I’ll ask her 
if she remembers “Perpetuum 
Mobile”. All the sounds made by 
a band that ended by the hand 
of tragedy stay with me, tracing 
small slivered visions of my mid-
youth. It’s easier to remember 
now than ever. 
I’m penning a story. It’s 
personal and vulnerable and 
slightly obtuse. All the good 
makings. There’s so much safety 
in the past. A seemingly concrete 
set of events. On the page. 
Trapped in ink. When a distant 
past melds with the present, 
however, that’s when the future 
loses 
its 
fearsomeness. 
My 
indecipherable journal entry is 
floating now. I wrote it all by 
myself. Please don’t land.

Usually, when I discuss the 
movie “Coraline” with other 
people, 
vague 
memories 
of 
childhood trauma and unease 
creep into the conversation, as 
countless children were given 
nightmares by this delightfully 
creepy children’s flick. And for 
good reason: The premise of a 
spider-lady threatening to sew 
buttons into your eyes while 
pretending to be your mother is 
deeply unsettling. OK, the plot 
is actually a bit more complex 
than 
that: 
Eleven-year-
old Coraline Jones (Dakota 
Fanning, “Once Upon a Time 
in Hollywood”) and her family 
move across the country where, 
in her new home, Coraline 
discovers an idyllic parallel 
world occupied by her “Other 
Mother.” Of course, I’m sure 
most kids forgot about those 
small details once the spider-
lady came out.
But 
I 
never 
had 
this 
experience 
with 
“Coraline.” 
“Coraline” has actually been a 
source of comfort to me in the 
past. It probably helped that I 
watched it after the period of 
my life when I was scared of 
the dark, but there’s something 
deeply charming about it that 
captivated me on my first watch.
I 
remember 
having 
a 
particularly rough day during 
my freshman year of high 
school. I was at a point in my life 
where my mental health was 
finally starting to stabilize, but 
for some odd reason, this day I 
was on the verge of tears. I may 
have been agonizing over some 
social interaction, or maybe I 
was just feeling insecure, but I 
just couldn’t calm myself down. 
The night dragged on as I began 
to realize I needed to distract 
myself, so I resolved to watch 
a movie. I’d been meaning to 

watch “Coraline” for a while, 
but until that point, I never had 
the time or the energy to do so. 
Naturally, I decided that was as 
good of a time as ever to finally 
watch it.
As I sat onto my bedroom 
floor, gently sipping my cup of 
mint tea, I started streaming 
the movie on my phone. It was 
difficult not to immediately 
be drawn in. In spite of being 
stressed moments before, I soon 

got lost in the world that director 
Henry Sellick built, taking joy 
in the oddities and wonders of 
both the “Other” world and the 
boring “real” world. The stop-
motion animation, with richly 
realized colors and delicately 
crafted 
environments, 
was 
mesmerizing.
The 
opening 
shot 
with 
neighbor Mr. Bobinski (Ian 
McShane, 
“John 
Wick”) 
doing 
handstands 
on 
the 
roof of the washed-out Pink 
Palace Apartments showed an 
incredible attention to detail 
and atmosphere. This becomes 
even more apparent when the 
real world is contrasted against 
the Other world, with vibrant 

and bright colors and none 
of the “boringness” Coraline 
hates so much. Every scene had 
personality, and the smallest 
details added to the overall 
ambience of the film.
However, 
none 
of 
this 
compared to the charm of the 
film’s writing and characters. 
I can’t describe the emotions 
I felt when I realized that 
Coraline’s 
two 
80-year-old 
neighbors, 
Misses 
Spink 
(Jennifer Saunders, “Absolutely 
Famous”) 
and 
Forcible 
(Dawn French, “French and 
Saunders”), were retired exotic 
dancers, with credits such as 
“King Leer” and “Julius Sees-
Her” to their names, but this 
sort of unabashed playfulness 
pervades 
the 
movie. 
The 
characters are at times so 
bizarre, 
so 
eccentric, 
that 
suppressing a laugh proves 
really difficult, and I definitely 
needed a laugh when I first sat 
down to watch “Coraline.”
By the time I had finished 
the film I felt better. Having 
finished my second cup of tea, 
and a bit bleary-eyed, I finally 
went to bed, but with a feeling of 
warmth. The movie itself wasn’t 
inherently heart-warming, but 
the love and care put into it 
certainly was. Since that night 
in freshman year of high school, 
“Coraline” has always held a 
warm place in my heart. Now, 
however, I take comfort in it 
for a different reason. When I 
watch it, I think of the people 
who were in my life back then, 
and of all the good memories 
we had. I think of the day after 
I first watched the film, when a 
couple of my friends helped ease 
my anxiety. I think of a warm 
cup of tea, slowly emptying 
as my anxieties are gradually 
pushed away.

THE B-SIDE: COMFORT

Finding comfort in the

When I describe myself as being 
“extremely online” to my friends, 
they usually agree — they too 
love memes and spend hours on 
Twitter.
Trying to clarify what I mean 
gets messy. It usually turns into 
some form of me reciting my own 
version of Bane’s quote from “The 
Dark Knight Rises”: “You merely 
adopted the internet; I was born in 
it, molded by it.”
If I was molded by the internet, 

“It’s foolish to run the risk of 
going mad for vanity’s sake,” says 
former Kentucky chess champion 
Harry Beltik (Harry Melling, 
“The Devil All The Time”) in 
director Scott Frank’s riveting 
new drama “The Queen’s Gambit.” 
This quote hints at the price one 
pays on the journey to be the best 
and the dangers of the reckless 
hyperfixation required of all 
those worthy of the title “genius.” 
No one seems more familiar with 
the costs than Elizabeth “Beth” 
Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy, “The 
Witch”), an orphan-turned-child-
chess-prodigy during the height 
of the Cold War. 
In a captivating performance, 
Anya Taylor-Joy captures the fire 
of tunnel-visioned protagonist 
Beth, as her trauma from losing 
her mother sets her on a cycle of 
escapism, filled with substance 
abuse and pouring herself into 
the only thing she understands: 
the game of chess. Beth describes 
the chess board not only as a place 
that makes sense to her, but as a 
place she can dominate. 
With the guidance of the 
orphanage’s janitor, Mr. Shaibel 
(Bill Camp, “The Outsider”), 
Beth quickly picks up the game, 
beating everyone in her path. 
Mr. Shaibel’s support is crucial 
to Beth’s development as a chess 
player, and for the first of many 
times, we see chess and the 
camaraderie that comes with 
it supporting Beth, giving her 
family and community in the face 
of loss.

Yet amid her victories, we 
are reminded of her worsening 
addiction 
to 
tranquilizers. 
Her addiction is momentarily 
halted when she is adopted 
by the Wheatleys, a typical, 
unhappily married 1960s couple, 
complete with a husband (Patrick 
Kennedy, “Mrs. Wilson”) that 
is constantly taking “business 
trips” and a housewife (Marielle 
Heller, “A Beautiful Day In The 
Neighborhood”) 
left 
to 
cope 
with her unhappiness through 
substance abuse. The series does 
a thorough analysis of the way 
battling trauma and addiction 
go 
hand-in-hand, 
particularly 
when it comes to suffering that 
otherwise 
goes 
unnoticed. 
Mrs. Wheatley’s trauma and 
subsequent addiction parallels 
Beth’s, and as time goes on their 
relationship blossoms into one 
of mutual understanding and 
support that truly functions as 
the backbone of the entire series.
While the show has powerful 
dramatic elements throughout, 
the relationship between Beth 
and Mrs. Wheatley is what 
secures “The Queen’s Gambit” as 
a must-watch. Their sometimes 
turbulent, 
always 
supportive 
relationship 
encapsulates 
love and family between two 
imperfect individuals. Beth and 
Mrs. Wheatley are flawed, and 
at times they act selfishly and 
enable each other’s addictions. 
They have also gone through a 
lot, yet the show reaffirms time 
and time again that they are 
worthy of love and beyond that, 
that their love is a necessity. Their 
uniquely liberating relationship 
allows them to be themselves in 

a world where they otherwise 
felt trapped in their pain. Even 
in moments where one of them 
acts flawed in a way the other 
recognizes, they realize that you 
can’t force someone to not make 
mistakes. While they are a mother 
and daughter relationship, the 
relationship lacks any semblance 
of patronizing behavior. They 
want the best for the other person, 
but they never assert what they 
think is best over the other. 
The building of family and 
support systems grounds this 
show as much as it grounds Beth. 
The series questions what it means 
to be alone versus supported, and 
what Beth can learn from both 
of these states of being. As an 
orphan, Beth has to build family 
from the ground up, and this goes 
beyond her relationship with her 
adoptive mother. There are so 
many moments that remind Beth 
she is never truly alone, even 
when she is at her most isolated: 
Mr. Shaibel lends Beth the money 
for her first chess competition; 
Beth’s friends check on her during 
her battle with addiction; Beth’s 
childhood best friend reminds 
her that they are family. While 
chess is the focal point of the 
series, it is obvious that interlaced 
between countless suspenseful 
matches, the true magic of “The 
Queen’s Gambit” lies within the 
love surrounding Beth and how 
it transforms her, and ultimately 
gives her the strength she needs 
to save herself. 
I can’t emphasize this enough: 
You’ve got to see this show.

Omar Apollo’s new mini- 
album explores identity

Did anyone else feel the 
need 
to 
completely 
reinvent 
themselves during quarantine? 
Maybe you were struck with the 
urge to dye your hair blue, take 
up skateboarding or even try a 
hand at baking (during that weird 
period in April when everyone 
started making sourdough)?
For 23-year-old musician 
Omar Apollo, the past few 
months in isolation have 
meant rewriting an entire 
album. 
The 
Indiana 
native, 
now 
residing 
in 
Los 
Angeles, had high hopes 
for a full project release 
and tour in the upcoming 
year, but, unsurprisingly, 
the 
pandemic 
threw 
a 
wrench in these plans. But 
instead of waiting for the 
indeterminate 
return 
of 
live musical performances, 
Apollo decided to scrap 
much of the material from 
his forthcoming album and put 
out a project more fitting of the 
circumstances. The final product, 
Apolonio, is a glossy and confident 
mini-album exploring adolescent 
struggles in middle America, 
sexuality and rising stardom. 
Despite the album’s run time 
of only 26 minutes, Apolonio 
manages to cover considerable 
ground in terms of style. On 

tracks like “I’m Amazing” and 
“Kamikaze,” Apollo plays around 
with his familiar laid-back pop 
sound, seen previously on past 
EPs Friends (2019) and Stereo 
(2018). “I’m Amazing” instantly 
pops as an opener thanks to 
bubbly production from Michael 
Uzowuru and Blake Slatkin, 
producers 
who’ve 
collectively 
worked with artists like Frank 
Ocean, Donald Glover and Gracie 

Abrams. 
On “Stayback” and “Hey Boy,” 
Apollo delivers sultry funk and 
R&B, with a seductive feature 
from 
Colombian 
American 
songstress Kali Uchis on the latter. 
Apollo also digs into his Chicano 
roots on the Spanish corrido track 
“Dos Uno Nueve (219),” paying 
homage to the style of narrative 
ballad popular among traditional 

Mexican communities. The song 
alludes to Apollo’s hometown 
area code, recounting instances 
of discrimination faced while 
growing up in the predominatly-
white suburbs of Hobart, Indiana. 
As the child of two immigrants 
from Guadalajara, Apollo has 
shared in previous interviews 
the very real struggles of food 
insecurity and poverty he faced 
throughout his upbringing. Now, 
as he sings on “Dos Uno 
Nueve (219),” “we have 
plenty to eat.” It’s a tale of 
redemption, one in which 
Apollo 
simultaneously 
celebrates his roots and lets 
go of the toxicity of the past. 
Between 
honeyed 
vocals 
and 
groove-
worthy guitar riffs, Apollo 
touches on another deeply 
personal theme: his much-
speculated-about sexuality. 
Though 
never 
declared 
outright on the project, 
tracks like “Bi Fren” paint a 
picture of stifled small town 
romances and heartbreak. 
Apollo professes, “I still 
like him, I still like him / I used to 
drive around your block without 
no license,” as if his swirling 
thoughts and desires chase him 
around the neighborhood in 
circles. Apollo tends to keep the 
subject of his sexuality close to 
the vest in interviews, but he’s 
dropped some not-so-subtle hints 
on previous works like the 2017 
track “Beauty Boy.” He sings 

longingly, “I want to say I love 
him / I want to say I love him / 
You take all my love / I’m afraid I 
can’t love no one again.” It seems 
that since then, Apollo has broken 
out of his shell of discretion, 
bringing the topic to the forefront 
of the “Stayback” music video 
released in early August. Directed 
by friend Aidan Cullen, the video 
follows Apollo as he navigates a 
bustling night out. Throughout 
the video, he exchanges furtive 
glances with a presumed male 
love interest who’s seated at a 
table with his girlfriend. The two 
steal tense glances from across 
the party, until Apollo finally 
stumbles 
defeatedly 
into 
an 
empty motel room to shelter from 
his rejection. As the music fades 
away, our mystery man finally 
appears in the doorway before the 
credits roll. Beneath the bright 
visuals and rich bassline, the 

“Stayback” video proves Apollo’s 
yearning remains unabated, even 
if he’s grown more comfortable 
expressing his identity to the world. 
In many ways, Apollo has 
graduated from his days of DIY 
bedroom pop. Not only does 
Apolonio stand as his most genre-
bending work to date, but it marks 
a clear transition from energetic 
ammatuer 
to 
increasingly 
established 
musician. 
While 
Apollo’s 
previous 
EPs 
were 
devoid of any features, Apolonio 
pulls the collaborative efforts 
of artists like Albert Hammond 
Jr. of The Strokes, who provides 
guitar 
and 
songwriting 
on 
the track “Useless,” and rising 
Australian 
singer-songwriter 
Ruel, who lends his smooth vocals 
on “Want U Around.” Apollo 
himself has blossomed vocally 
since his last project, perfecting 
the trademark falsetto that gives 

his music its irresistible charm 
à la Prince. Apolonio may be 
compact in structure, but it’s a 
testament to artistic growth and 
experimentation. 
The album isn’t a complete 
departure from the glittering pop 
of Apollo’s past, but it’s certainly 
his most dynamic project yet. 
There’s a shift in narrative on 
Apolonio, and the artist no longer 
rests on the laurels of charming 
and 
catchy 
tunes. 
Instead, 
we see a vulnerable Apollo, 
who’s managed to both mature 
musically and maintain the same 
vibrancy that keeps his fans 
coming back. 
Look out for Apollo’s recorded 
performance 
and 
concert 
documentary from Paisley Park 
on Oct. 27.

Booker nominee ‘Burnt 
Sugar’: an untamed debut

The words in Avni Doshi’s 
“Burnt Sugar” hit you like a 
bullet. Doshi doesn’t mind 
that they come with a burden. 
“It’s easy to unravel when no 
one is watching,” she writes 
within ten pages of the novel. 
It is, I find myself thinking. 
In fact, it would be so easy to 
unravel right now. 
Born in New Jersey to 
Indian immigrants, Doshi was 
an art critic and curator before 
turning to fiction. “Burnt 
Sugar,” Doshi’s debut novel, 
has been selected for the 2020 
Booker 
Prize 
shortlist. 
The story revolves around 
an aging mother, Tara, 
and 
her 
middle-aged 
daughter, 
Antara, 
who 
live in Pune, India. Antara 
is a struggling artist who 
can barely take care of 
herself, but finds herself 
caring for her mother 
instead. 
Each 
chapter 
reveals another layer in 
a 
tumultuous 
mother-
daughter 
relationship 
that is grounded in hate 
but forced to evolve into 
something 
resembling 
love. 
The 
narrative 
is 
set in Pune, India, and 
Doshi’s ties to the country 
are deeply embedded into 
the plot — “Burnt Sugar” was 
published in India as “Girl in 
White Cotton.”
“Burnt Sugar” is a richly 
layered story that shows us 
how tangled and performative 
our lives can be. Despite 
juggling the responsibilities 
of being an artist, a wife and a 
daughter, Antara’s life is filled 
with expectations that are 
never fulfilled. “I wonder if, 
when I’m old and frail and can 
see the shape of my end in front 
of me, I will still be waiting 
for the future to roll in,” she 
says. Antara’s relationships 
frame how she views herself 
— strong and capable some 
mornings, ashamed and guilt-
ridden on others. I think we all 
feel this same environment-
driven 
fluctuation 
in 
our 
personalities, 
though 
most 
days I’m too scared to admit it. 
The pillar of “Burnt Sugar,” 
and the core of Antara’s 
turmoil, is her relationship 
with her mother. “She named 
me 
Antara, 
intimacy, 
not 
because she loved the name 

but because she hated herself,” 
Antara says. Tara escaped to 
an ashram — spiritual healing 
retreats in India that are 
known to occasionally evolve 
into religious cults — and left 
ashram leaders to take care of 
her daughter. 30 years later, 
Antara is caring for a mother 
who didn’t do the same for her. 
“Being together or apart was 
independent 
from 
wanting 
and happiness,” Antara says. 
Yet, like many blood ties, Tara 
and Antara feel a pull toward 
each other despite a desperate 
need for escape.
Doshi compels us to believe 
that 
this 
wild 
mother-
daughter 
relationship 
isn’t 

as 
unusual 
as 
we 
think. 
Ultimately, our closest blood-
relationships form many of 
our early experiences, and 
these make us who we are 
today. Antara was humiliated, 
body-shamed and ridiculed by 
her mother as she grew up. “It 
was a warning not to get too 
comfortable with myself,” she 
says. Years later, Antara feels 
this same discontent when 
she herself becomes a mother. 
“I stare at the girl’s little face 
because I don’t know where to 
look,” she says in the minutes 
after giving birth to her 
daughter. The relationships in 
“Burnt Sugar” hit too close for 
comfort, but their truths are 
addictive.
“Burnt Sugar” builds on 
these character relationships 
to expose the ugliness of 
the human condition. Doshi 
writes of our biases and flaws 
as if they were key ingredients 
in our makeup. The most 
notable examples relate to the 
Western world’s perception of 
India. “The British built some 
lovely 
buildings,” 
Antara’s 

mother-in-law exclaims on a 
visit to India from America. 
Any novice in Indian history 
knows how dark this statement 
is in light of India’s occupation 
by the British. But I think of 
the tourist crowds surging 
around the Victoria Memorial 
this last Christmas, when I 
went to visit my grandparents 
in Kolkata (the ex-capital of 
British India), and realize how 
true this rings today. Antara 
fields 
similar 
sentiments 
from 
her 
husband, 
Dilip, 
who grew up in America. “I 
asked him not to idealize the 
polite veneer of his childhood 
because everyone knows what 
Americans are really capable 
of,” Antara says. 
Doshi uses culture 
shock as a way to 
expose 
aggressions 
that we are all guilty of 
committing in viewing 
another culture. But 
India is still embraced 
in 
the 
novel 
and 
provides 
a 
vibrant 
background 
for 
the 
plot. Doshi writes of 
India in a colloquial 
way that makes it hard 
to 
fully 
understand 
the 
novel 
if 
you’re 
not familiar with the 
culture, 
similar 
to 
Meghna 
Majumdar’s 
“A Burning” released 
earlier this summer. Digestive 
biscuits, 
balconies 
of 
apartments stacked on top 
of each other, crevices that 
allow you to see into your 
neighbors 
homes, 
breaking 
rotis with one hand instead 
of two. These cultural details 
make beautiful sense to me 
as the daughter of Indian 
immigrants, but they probably 
won’t ring as clear for others. 
Thankfully, 
that 
doesn’t 
make “Burnt Sugar” any less 
enjoyable. 
Regardless of your cultural 
background, “Burnt Sugar” 
will pulse with an addictive 
and thrilling energy. Every 
sentence is a treasure to read 
and brings you one step closer 
to 
yourself, 
even 
though 
you didn’t ask for it. This 
unsettling yet beautiful novel 
is a strong contender to win 
the Booker Prize in November 
— relish it before it stuns the 
world.

Why my mom can’t stop 
rewatching TV’s ‘Friends’

My 
mom 
has 
watched 
“Friends” start to finish so 
many times that everyone in 
my family has lost count. She’s 
on an agonizingly slow journey 
to recovery from a stroke a 
few years ago that has left her 
without energy to do very much 
other than watch TV most days. 
This year I’m pretty sure I saw 
her blast through all 10 seasons 
in a matter of weeks, only to 
dive into another back-to-back 
rewatch.
We all have that friend that 
has seen “The Office” 15 times. 
You know the one — the friend 
that has hundreds of “Want to 
read” books on Goodreads, but 
never fails to spend each summer 
re-reading “Harry Potter” front 
to back. Sometimes they’ll even 
have the audacity to ask for your 
music recommendations, only 
for you to catch them listening to 
Blonde on Spotify for the eighth 
time that week.
I think everyone has that one 
special show or book that you 
can’t help but return to over 
and over. The 21st century is 
insane because anyone with a 
cell phone in their pocket has 
immediate access to millions of 
books, movies, shows, albums 
and games at their fingertips. 
We’re also firehosed with new 
content to consume on a daily 
basis — more than is humanly 
possible for any sane person to 
keep up with. All that limitless 
potential 
for 
novel 
artistic 
consumption and I still dump 
hundreds of hours into replays 
year after year.
Why do we keep coming back?
For some students, rewatching 
their favorite shows and movies 
is a way to cope with a busy 
college lifestyle.
“A lot of the appeal of 

rewatching 
the 
things 
you 
know you like is you already 
know what’s gonna happen,” 
Engineering junior Jacob Renard 
explained. “It’s good background 
noise, and there’s just enough 
going on that you don’t have to 
pay full attention to it.”
In college, time is a luxury few 
can afford. Watching something 
new is a commitment. It demands 
full attention — but not if you’ve 
already seen it. Rewatching 
something 
you 
know 
you 
already like is actually extremely 
efficient. It’s a guaranteed source 
of comfort to pad the stress of 
constant 
homework 
without 
actually costing any precious 
time. A comfort rewatch, even 
in the background, helps you 
maintain your sanity despite a 
stressful schedule.
It’s pretty straightforward to 
choose a rewatch for Renard. 
“I’ve had a long day, I’m just 
gonna throw something on that I 
know I like,” he said.
“New Girl” is his rejuvenating 
rewatch of choice. “It’s always 
funny to me,” he said. “There are 
jokes that I’ve laughed at every 
single time.” For any overworked 
student, it just makes sense.
For other students, a rewatch 
is a little more personal.
LSA senior Shihua Lu has 
rewatched the same 80-episode 
TV series, dozens upon dozens 
of times. “I watch it almost every 
day because I watch it when 
I’m chatting with my friends, I 
watch it when I do homework, 
writing … I was even planning 
to see a therapist (about it),” she 
laughed.
Lu’s addiction is “My Own 
Swordsman,” a TV series she 
described as “a Chinese version 
of ‘Friends.’” I’d never heard 
of it before, so I tried to watch 
an episode I found on YouTube 
to see for myself. I couldn’t 
understand a single word, but I 
quickly felt a sense of inherent 

coziness from the vibrant cast 
of tight-knit characters. There’s 
definitely an alternate universe 
where my mom grew up in 
China and fell in love with “My 
Own Swordsman” instead of 
“Friends.” I could immediately 
see why Lu might feel so attached 
to the show. But her connection 
to it goes a little deeper than just 
a comforting rewatch.
“When I was in primary 
school I was actually bullied by 
a lot of classmates,” Lu said. “I 
always wanted to have a very 
close friendship or relationship 
with other people. So I guess 
that’s why I rewatch it over 
and over again, because I think 
that’s the kind of relationship (I 
wanted).”
Lu’s words brought me back to 
my own childhood — I too was 
bullied in elementary school. 
I remember wishing I had a 
close friendship, a yearning that 
persisted with every passing 
friendless year. I had my own 
comfort show for the same 
reason as Lu: “Toradora,” a 
romcom anime following a close-
knit class of high school friends. 
I first saw it in middle school, 
where the absence of friends had 
me mentally spiraling. Watching 
the joyous companionship in 
“Toradora” tapped into one of 
my greatest vulnerabilities. I 
so badly wanted to experience 
those heartfelt friendships with 
my own classmates. To this day, 
it’s the only TV show I’ve ever 
rewatched more than once.
After 
growing 
attached 
to 
“My 
Own 
Swordsman,” 
Lu sought out the kinds of 
friendships like those depicted 
in the show. I remember doing 
the same thing with “Toradora,” 
flipping through my yearbook 
and wondering who could be the 
Kitamura to my Ryuuji.
Where quality time is hard 
to find, rewatching the antics 
of a tight-knit friend circle can 

grow to feel like a comforting, 
familiar 
presence. 
“I’m 
the 
only child of my family, and my 
parents are busy, and I don’t 
have my grandparents with me,” 
Lu explained. “So I kinda watch 
that TV series as company. I treat 
them as my family members.” It 
reminded me of the way my mom 
always compared our family to 
“Friends.” Whenever my brother 
does anything remotely funny, 
she calls him Joey.
When most people think of a 
“comfort” watch or a “comfort” 
read, I imagine they might 
think of shows like “Parks and 
Recreation” or books like “Harry 
Potter.” 
The 
stereotypical 
easy-watch comedy or easy-
read nostalgia trip with cozy 
characters to grow attached to. 
Where a rewatch or reread is 
kind of like a warm hug.
Engineering 
senior 
Liam 
Russell’s 
warm 
hug 
is 
the 
menacing Batman classic “The 
Dark Knight.” Not a cheery 
comedy or classic kid’s book, but 
one of the most grim superhero 
movies out there. Still, a cold film 
can make for a warm sentiment.
“I would watch it with my 
brother almost all the time,” 
Russell reminisced. “It reminds 
me of my childhood, sitting 
in front of the big TV with 
my brother just watching the 

movie.”
“The Dark Knight” is one of 
the most critically acclaimed 
films of the 2000s, but it’s far 
from being warm or comforting 
on paper. I watched it when I was 
a kid too, and all I remember is 
Harvey Dent’s disfigured face 
and ruthless killing spree. But 
our memories are powerful, 
and “The Dark Knight” is 
transportive 
for 
Russell. 
Where rewatching “My Own 
Swordsman” 
and 
“Toradora” 
brought Lu and me to a place we 
wished to be, “The Dark Knight” 
brought Russell back to a place 
he’d been before — the place he 
fondly remembered watching it, 
his childhood, sitting in front of 
the big TV with his brother.
Russell’s warm hug in the 
video game world comes in 
the form of “Dark Souls,” a 
gloomy and unforgiving action 
RPG. Replaying it also brings 
Russell back to the time he first 
experienced it.
“Dark Souls” is known for 
its 
oppressively 
depressing 
atmosphere. It follows a cursed 
undead 
protagonist 
on 
a 
pilgrimage to discover the fate 
of their people. Not the warmest 
or fuzziest story, but it hasn’t 
stopped Russell from replaying it 
five or six times now. In fact, the 
darkness of “Dark Souls” is part 

of the draw for him.
“Comfort 
is 
different 
for 
different 
people,” 
Russell 
said. “And for me, comfort is 
escaping into another world, 
but not another world where 
everything’s easy … it isn’t a 
walk in the park, you still have to 
work hard, and I sorta like that 
attitude.”
The game is notorious for its 
extreme difficulty curve. When 
Russell first played it, he got 
stuck pretty early on and came 
close to giving up. True to his 
philosophy, he worked hard and 
persevered until he beat it. But 
what if he never did? What if he 
gave up and never finished it, 
and “Dark Souls” never entered 
his replay rotation?
I wonder how close I’ve been 
to experiencing a work of art that 
would have become extremely 
important to me if I’d just given 
it a chance. Like Russell, some 
of my favorite movies and video 
games are so important to me 
because of the time of life they 
return me to when I play them. 
I also have memories of sitting 
in front of the big TV with my 
brother, and “Paper Mario” is

‘Doctor Who’ understands 
the comfort change brings

Day by day, the walls are 
closing in. 
Or at least they seem to be. 
Maybe it’s because I spend most 
of my online classes looking at 
my room displayed over my 
shoulder, shrunk down, like 
me, to a square on the top-left 
corner of my screen. 
But that’s not all. 
My phone swells with news 
notifications, emails and phone 
calls about Nov. 3, 2020. The 
fall semester Zooms forward 
to 
its 
bitter 
end, 
hurling 
assignments down at me like a 
never-ending air raid. 
The stresses pile up like 
towering trash heaps that grow 
taller and more unstable day by 
day. The walls are closing in. 
But I know a way 
out. 
In the small strip of 
purple, 
star-studded 
sky visible over the 
landfill that is 2020, 
a blue police box flies 
across 
the 
horizon. 
The trash piles melt 
away, along with the 
dirt beneath my feet. 
The police box, a time 
machine 
called 
the 
TARDIS 
(Time 
and 
Relative Dimension in 
Space), shoots towards 
me. Its doors open. 
And for 45 minutes, 
I’m free. 
***
Through the years, 
I’ve thought again and 
again that I’d grown 
out of “Doctor Who,” only to 
be yanked back whenever I 
needed it most. The show isn’t 
always great, I’ll admit, but 
there’s always something great 
about it. 
Every actor to take on The 
Doctor, an eternal being called 
a “Time Lord” who changes 
their face when their current 
body perishes (and the previous 

actor quits), does something 
fascinating with the role — The 
Doctor has lived for thousands 
of 
years, 
and 
the 
actors 
somehow 
express 
centuries 
of joy, trauma and knowledge 
in every scene, no matter how 
terribly written. The Doctor, 
like the show itself, changes 
on a dime from episode to 
episode: 
Sometimes 
they’re 
lighthearted, 
sometimes 
haunted, 
sometimes 
totally 
alien and sometimes deeply 
human.
Take the first season of 
the rebooted “Who,” which 
premiered in 2005. The Ninth 
Doctor, played by Christopher 
Eccelston (“The Leftovers”), 
is introduced when he saves a 
woman named Rose from living 
department store mannequins. 
“I’m The Doctor,” he says. 
“Run for your life.” 

It’s silly, right? The terrible 
special effects, even for 2005, 
don’t help much either. 
Yet, in an episode where 
the villain is an alien made of 
living plastic, there’s a moment 
powerful enough to bring tears 
to one’s eye. When Rose asks 
who he is, The Doctor says this:
“It’s like when you’re a kid, 
the first time they tell you 

that the world is turning and 
you just can’t quite believe it 
’cause everything looks like it’s 
standing still. I can feel it … The 
turn of the earth. The ground 
beneath our feet is spinning at 
a thousand miles an hour. The 
entire planet is hurtling around 
the sun at sixty seven thousand 
miles an hour. And I can feel 
it. We’re falling through space, 
you and me, clinging to the skin 
of this tiny little world. And, if 
we let go … That’s who I am.”
That’s also the comfort of 
“Doctor Who”: The show is 
limitless, 
untethered 
from 
our world and its rules. The 
Doctor and his companions 
hurtle 
through 
space 
and 
time in a reliably unreliable 
time 
machine, 
looking 
for 
adventure. 
“Doctor 
Who” 
can be about anything. There 
are historical stories, horror 
stories, sci-fi stories, love 
stories and whatever this 
is. 
A 
given 
episode 
of 
“Doctor Who” can also be 
of any quality. In Season 
5, for example, a deeply 
sad, 
Hugo-nominated 
episode 
about 
Vincent 
Van Gogh is sandwiched 
between 
an 
episode 
about lizard people living 
underground and another 
where the bad guy is a 
spaceship on autopilot, 
disguised as the upstairs 
room in an apartment. 
When 
any 
other 
popular 
franchise 
becomes utter trash, say 
“Game of Thrones” or 
“Star 
Wars,” 
everyone 
loses their minds. When 
“Doctor Who” throws out a 
dud, there’s always next week. 
Week by week, total shlock 
exists side by side with the very 
best TV has to offer. There’s 
nothing else like it.
Season 4 has an episode 
where Agatha Christie and 
The Doctor fight a giant alien 
wasp, 
and 
another, 
called 
“Turn Left,” where England

becomes a fascist regime due 
to 
worldwide 
disaster 
and 
undocumented 
refugees 
are 
sent to concentration camps. 
“England for the English, 
etcetera,” one character says. 
“They can’t send us home … (so) 
they build labor camps.”
“Labor camps,” another says, 
weeping, as the character is 
shoved into a truck. “That’s 
what they called them last time 
… It’s happening again.”
Released 
in 
2008, 
yet 
somehow 
predicting 
the 
darkest implications of modern 
far-right nationalism, episodes 
like “Turn Left” sometimes 
make it seem like “Doctor 
Who” really does time travel. 
Yet there’s no magic to it; the 
show’s expansiveness allows 
for any writer to pilot the 
TARDIS, sometimes producing 
piercing political commentary, 
sometimes delightful escapism, 
sometimes total cheese or, at 
“Doctor Who”’s most striking, 
a mix of all three. 
The Daleks, villains who’ve 
fought the Doctor since 1963, are 
the most iconic example. They 
were radicalized in a never-
ending war on their planet, 
and 
became 
fascist 
Dalek-
supremacists, who believe that 
every other organism needs to 
be “exterminated.” As horrific 
as this ideology is, though, 
Daleks look like candy-colored 
pepper shakers, with weapons 
oddly similar to whisks and 

toilet plungers. 
“Doctor Who” is also unique 
as, every few seasons, its main 
character is killed off and 
replaced. Then, time and time 
again, after a gut-wrenching 
death, The Doctor becomes a 
stranger. Viewers are forced 
to accept — and embrace — 
change, even when it means 
losing someone they love. The 
Eleventh Doctor, played by 
Matt Smith (“The Crown”), 
exemplifies this just before his 
regeneration: 
“It 
all 
just 
disappears, 
doesn’t it? All you are, gone 
in a moment, like breath on 
a mirror. Any moment now, 
he’s coming, the Doctor. I am 
the Doctor, and I always will 
be. But times change and so 
must I … We all change. When 
you think about it, we’re all 
different people, all throughout 
our lives and that’s okay, that’s 
good, you gotta keep moving 
so long as you remember all 
the people that you used to be 
… I will not forget one line of 
this. Not one day. I swear. I will 
always remember when the 
Doctor was me.”
In “Doctor Who,” even at 
its most terrifying, adventure 
always triumphs over despair, 
the bad guys lose and the 
universe is always saved. Above 
all, things change. 
That’s why I’m back to 
watching “Doctor Who,” yet 
again, in the fall of 2020. 

Even at its worst, the show 
always has another surprise, 
or regeneration, up its sleeve. 
“Doctor Who” is an eternal 
reminder that there is a whole 
universe out there — without 
COVID-19, Donald Trump or 
Zoom calls, and things always 
get better. In a time when 
everything is uncertain and 
the walls seem to be closing 
in, it’s a relief to know that the 
TARDIS still sails through all 
of time and space. 
Most comforting are the 
Christmas 
episodes, 
where 
aliens frequently make the 
bizarre choice to invade on 
Christmas night, sometimes 
even using Christmas-themed 
tech such as Santa-Androids. 
The specials sometimes get 
quite dark (The Doctor has 
been killed and regenerated 
three 
times 
in 
Christmas 
episodes), 
but 
are 
always 
filled 
with 
white 
snow, 
English Evergreens glittering 
with ornaments and colorful 
presents. Thankfully, as 2020 
draws to a close, the Doctor is 
back in the “Revolution of The 
Daleks” holiday special. 
Even if they have chosen to 
ruin Christmas with another 
invasion, the genocidal pepper 
shakers are still better than 
what we’re dealing with.

I’d grown out of

I

n the fall of 2017, I stood nervously 
in front of the printers in Hatcher 
Graduate Library, observing the 

passersby and waiting for a hundred cop-
ies of full-sheet fliers to print out. Amo, 
Cole and I — the three founding members 
of the University of Michigan’s first free 
speech advocacy group, Michigan Open 
Discourse — had written and designed 
these fliers for distribution across cam-
pus. On them in big, bold, capitalized let-
ters read, “LET SPENCER SPEAK,” in 
reference to self-described identitarian 
and white supremacist Richard Spen-
cer. And, underneath this bold request, 
were bulleted points explaining why we 
believed that Richard Spencer should be 
given a platform to speak at the Univer-
sity. One of them read:

“Know thy enemy.”
Richard Spencer is a racist fraud, but 

one with influence. We should rationally 
confront and argue against his ideas in 
the open, not shield ourselves from them 
— not to mention that pushing Spen-
cer away only validates the persecution 
complex of his impressionable follow-
ers, driving them deeper into radical 
and dangerous underground movements. 
Free expression, regardless of content, is 
fundamental to the purpose of a univer-
sity setting, as affirmed by the bipartisan 
Supreme Court majority in the 1972 Su-
preme Court case, Healy v. James.

Cole and I continued waiting for the 

fliers to print. We both admitted to each 
other that we were slightly uncomfort-
able printing them in a public setting like 
the library, when they had such a conten-
tious demand plastered across the face of 
the flier. Neither of us wanted to be asso-
ciated with the fliers, even though we’d 
both endorsed their content, which was 
relatively mild and apolitical. 

Eventually, though, the hundred fli-

ers were printed, and the three of us 
went to post them around campus. Even 
though we were posting them up around 
10 o’clock at night, when basically no 
one was walking around campus, we 
only managed to post a grand 
total of nine fliers, mostly out of 
fear of being spotted and associ-
ated with their messaging. We 
had seen how most students on 
campus reacted to Spencer’s im-
pending visit.

Spencer’s rumored visit to 

the University’s campus sparked 
widespread outcry among the 
student body: Controversially, 
some individuals posted “It’s 
okay to be white” fliers at cam-
pus 
buildings, 
while 
others 

started a change.org petition 
advocating that the University 
deny Spencer’s request to speak 
on campus. The Michigan Daily 
even published a strong edito-
rial disavowing Spencer and his 
views and decrying the idea that 
he should be allowed to speak on 
campus. 

Amo, Cole, and I believed 

Spencer should have been al-
lowed to speak, because though 
his ideas are abhorrent and unin-
tellectual, we felt that he should 
be confronted and dismantled in 

a public setting — like a university, where 
he would be subject to rigorous ques-
tioning from a skeptical audience. And 
we further wanted to affirm his right to 
free speech and expression while coun-
tering his bigoted arguments. This was 
the motivation behind the designing of 
these fliers, and it was our first initiative 
through our organization Michigan Open 
Discourse. 

Expectedly, all the fliers were torn 

down by the next morning. This is not 
characteristic of conservative activism, 
but it is certainly not an uncommon ex-
perience to be facing certain barriers. 
Examples of this include widespread 
social disapproval, as is the case on the 
predominantly liberal U-M campus, to 
promulgating conservative ideas. Often, 
conservatives are mistreated, unjustly 
maligned or have to face significant re-
percussions for simply espousing view-
points that don’t align with the prevail-
ing liberal orthodoxy. 

In 2014, U-M student Omar Mahmood 

wrote a satirical column for The Michi-
gan Review titled “Do the Left Thing” 
mocking politically correct attitudes 
among college students. In response, his 
residence hall room was egged, he re-
ceived threats from fellow students and 
he was let go from his columnist position 
at The Michigan Daily.

A liberal activist who wrote a contro-

versial satirical column would not have 
experienced the same type of pushback 
from fellow students. There aren’t as 
many barriers for a left-leaning individu-
al to espouse their viewpoints on college 
campuses, especially at a University that 
has more liberal-identifying students.

It’s clearly not uncommon to be mis-

treated or judged for having divergent 
viewpoints or for taking a relatively radi-
cal stance like a conservative one, but it 
is common to face greater scrutiny in or-
der to enact conservative changes. 

I spoke with Deion Kathawa, a former 

U-M student and former editor in chief 
of the independent, conservative news-

paper on campus, The Michigan Review, 
to understand his experience as a conser-
vative activist. Beside his extensive set of 
written clips for The Michigan Review, 
Kathawa’s 
most 
important 
initiative 

as a conservative activist was propos-
ing a resolution to the Central Student 
Government to do the following things: 
affirm the commitment to freedom of 
speech outlined in the First Amendment 
and the University’s student code, com-
mit to “non-obstructionism” with respect 
to campus events that involve controver-
sial figures, adopt a similar set of free 
speech guidelines that the University of 
Chicago adopted and commit to includ-
ing diversity of viewpoint in the Univer-
sity’s diversity initiatives.

“I felt that officials in the University 

were not specifically committed to pro-
tecting the speech of other students at 
this University, so I decided that I want-
ed to do something outside of rhetorical 
advocacy,” Kathawa said. “I opted for 
something in the official channels. … I 
went, I proposed it, there was some par-
liamentary chicanery that pushed it back 
a couple weeks. Eventually I got to say 
my piece, people voted for it. It lost pret-
ty handily, 27-3.”

It’s telling that Kathawa’s idea, which 

was simply to affirm the right to freedom 
of speech in a number of ways and include 
diversity of viewpoint in the University 
of Michigan’s diversity codes and hiring 
processes, was shot down by committee 
members by such a significant margin. 
Not that there is necessarily inherent 
bias within these systems constructed by 
students against conservative activism, 
but there are certainly barriers prevent-
ing conservatives from achieving activ-
ism victories — the students and chan-
nels through which they have to operate 
through are, naturally, more left-leaning.

In rare instances, conservatives do 

achieve activism victories, though these 
are long processes and require undertak-
ing difficult procedural manipulations. 
I spoke with Amo, one of my fellow co-

founders of Michigan Open Discourse, 
to highlight such victories. Amo is not 
exactly conservative, but he has right-
leaning views.

Amo served as a plaintiff on the recent 

Speech First v. Schlissel legislation. This 
was a court case, filed by Speech First, 
a free speech advocacy group, who was 
arguing on behalf of several students 
who’d been identified by the U-M Bias 
Response Team as violators of its code of 
conduct, meaning they had promulgated 
some type of offensive speech, in the con-
text of harassing and bullying, and were 
reported for it. 

“A representative from Speech First 

reached out to me and Cole and asked us 
because we were at The Review,” Amo 
said. “She thought that maybe we would 
have some expertise … my angle on it was 
that I had experience with a bad speech 
climate at Michigan, and I had witnessed 
conservatives being mistreated. I knew 
that people didn’t want their real names 
officially associated with the paper.” 

Amo mentioned that this feeling ex-

tended beyond his work at The Review.

 “I just felt that in my classes there was 

a left-wing bias, and I didn’t necessari-
ly feel comfortable voicing my opinions 
that were divergent,” he said.

The Speech First v. Schlissel court 

case was settled, resulting in a victory for 
Speech First, and the disbanding of the 
U-M Bias Response Team (which would 
later be replaced with the Campus Cli-
mate Support). The exact contention in 
the court case was not over the Univer-
sity’s policy to reprimand individuals for 
acts of bullying and harassment, but rath-
er over their definitions of these terms 
that infringed upon protected speech. 
This court case demonstrates that, even 
though Speech First won the case, there 
are systematic barriers in place that cre-
ate a campus environment that is un-
friendly to free speech and conservative 
ideas. Evidence of this attitude within 
the University administration includes a 
U-M-sponsored “Bias Response Team,” 
which works to create a campus climate 
harmful to the right to free speech.

I also spoke with professor of Af-

roamerican and African Studies Angela 
Dillard about conservatives, faculty per-
ceptions of conservatives and activism 
among conservatives. The crux of our 
conversation was a sentiment we both 
agreed with: 

“I think it’s odd to use the term mi-

nority group (to describe conservative 
students on campus),” Dillard said. “I 
mean they certainly are numerically, 
statistically a smaller population of stu-
dents who self-identify as conservatives 
on campus than who would self-identify 
as liberals … (but) it’s a kind of political 
and ideological claim in and of itself to 
call conservatives a minority group.” 

Dillard added that while it may not be 

appropriate to define conservatives on 
campus as a “minority group,” she ac-
knowledged the odd positioning these 
students have within the campus culture.

aoyuan Liu’s suggestion to 

compare answers was reject-

ed outright after a difficult 

math exam. “Don’t involute yourself,” her 

classmates told her. Gaoyuan Liu, an LSA 

transfer student who then studied at one 

of the most prestigious universities in 

China, never felt the ubiquitous presence 

of the word “involution” in her and her 

peers’ lives as much as she did that day in 

the classroom.

The term “involution” was popularized 

by Clifford Geertz, an eminent cultural 

anthropologist who used it as a descrip-

tion of the agricultural process in which 

refinements of wet-rice cultivation led to 

more and more intricate labor use, with-

out creating significant progress in other 

social sectors such as technology and poli-

tics. The use of the word has unexpected-

ly stepped out of the academic world and 

gained prominence among young people 

in China in recent years.

In China, this term has been borrowed 

to describe the phenomenon where the 

competition for social and economic re-

sources is intensified. With more and 

more people opting into this game, the 

standard of “being average” increases dra-

matically.

“The result (of involution) is usually 

that everyone puts more efforts to meet 

the raised standard, but due to the fixed 

amount of available resources, no one in 

the competition yields better returns,” 

said one of the most up-voted comments 

on Zhihu, the “Chinese Quora.”

Involution didn’t make its entry to the 

public consciousness until recent years, 

though, as Gaoyuan recalled, her past 20 

years of life had always been played out 

under “the involution rules.” 

“Enrollment rates of magnet elementa-

ry, middle and high schools are extremely 

low,” Liu said. “Before getting into college, 

I have already been trained to coexist with 

and succeed in competition.”

Drawing 
a 
comparison 
with 
her 

15-year-old sister, who is in eighth grade, 

Gaoyuan said that there is an obvious in-

tensification in the trend of involution. 

She said, “They are already learning and 

taking exams that are originally oriented 

towards college students … When I was in 

middle school, I took two extracurricu-

lar courses or so every weekend, which is 

already hectic. Now my sister’s weekend 

schedules are fully packed by extracur-

ricular activities — unimaginable.” 

For many young people in China, invo-

lution is sometimes an entrenched institu-

tion rather than a personal choice. For ex-

ample, at Gaoyuan’s previous university, it 

is a written rule that the number of As as-

signed in every course, including A-s and 

A+s, should be manipulated to fall within 

a 30-percent quota. 

Ting, a student at a first-tier university 

in China, questioned the meaning of this 

by-design competitive mechanism. 

“Higher education should not only be 

about getting good grades and building up 

resumes. A 4.0 GPA isn’t necessarily in-

dicative of great command of knowledge. 

But I can’t resist. I am afraid of falling be-

hind. I feel trapped,” She said. 

Biao Xiang, a professor of social an-

thropology at the University of Oxford, 

referred to this as “a competition with no 

option of failure or withdrawal” in an in-

terview.

Behind this endless cycle of anxiety lies 

the explosive growth of college degree 

holders. 

In China, the gross tertiary enrollment 

rate rose from 3.1% in 1990 and 7.8% in 

2000 to 29.7% in 2013, nearly a tenfold ex-

pansion compared to two decades ago.

“In the 1980s, the title of college stu-

dent itself equated the definition of ‘elite.’ 

Today, higher education becomes another 

round of elitism sorting,” pointed out by 

Jingjing Xu in an Sanlian Lifeweek article. 

“In addition to the scarcity of resourc-

es, the monotonic standard of success is 

an important reason,” said Changyuan 

Qiu, a junior studying computer science at 

the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao 

Tong University Joint Institute.

This tendency is not endemic to Chi-

na. Between 2000 and 2014, the number 

of students in higher education globally 

more than doubled, rising from 100 mil-

lion to 207 million, according to a report 

published by the United Nations Educa-

tional, Scientific and Cultural Organi-

zation together with UNESCO Interna-

tional Institute for Educational Planning 

and UNESCO GEM Report. In the United 

States, the growth is particularly remark-

able. According to the Census Bureau, re-

ported college enrollment has increased 

elevenfold since 1940, from 1.5 million to 

17.9 million.

Is U.S. higher education confronted 

with the same trend of involution? Views 

on this question run the gamut. Having 

studied at both the University of Michi-

gan and SJTU, Changyuan thinks that the 

minimum threshold grading scale com-

monly adopted by American universities 

prevents the destructive competition from 

happening. Under this system, students 

are evaluated based on their own mastery 

of the materials, not the comparison with 

peers.

“At U-M, as long as you get a 93+ overall 

score, you are guaranteed an A,” he said. 

Fatma Müge Göçek, a professor of so-

ciology and women’s gender studies, at-

tended college from 1975 to 1978 in Istan-

bul, Turkey, came to the U.S. in 1981 and 

received her doctorate from Princeton 

University in 1988. She asserted that signs 

of involution had been witnessed in both 

Turkey and the United States in recent de-

cades. 

“I think it is definitely involution: the 

demand for degrees goes up constantly 

while the supply of degrees can never 

catch up with it, leading the education pie 

to be more competitively divided among a 

larger number of candidates,” Göçek said. 

She warns that despite facing fierce 

competition, Generation Y — also known 

as Millennials — is likely to be the first 

generation in recent American history 

that makes substantially less than their 

parents. 

“Findings demonstrate that the U.S. 

economic boom in the past is over — mil-

lennials will make 20% less than their par-

ents’ generation, and millennials with a 

college degree will make about 40% more 

than their less educated counterparts,” 

she said. “This result is certainly partial-

ly due to involution, but it is also due to 

global competition: other countries have 

copied the U.S. economic boom, thereby 

taking away larger chunks of business 

from the U.S.”

Caught in the middle of overwhelming 

competition traps and expected returns 

in the gutter, how should college students 

navigate education, mental health and 

their future? The question demands not 

only addressing the idea of involution, but 

rethinking how we face it.

How involution 
perturbs China’s 
youth

egend says a posse of so-
rority girls today looks 
like this: designer ten-

nis shoes, various shades of hon-
ey-highlighted hair, a cluster of 
pastel-toned sweatshirts, and the 
quintessential sweatpants don-
ning their sorority letters.

While the American soror-

ity system initially positioned 
itself as an emblem of tradition 
and female “excellence” when 
it originated over a century ago, 
it has since been held to signifi-
cant levels of controversy from its 
historically racist practices to its 
“nightmarish” hazing rituals. As 
an effect, the term “sorority girl” 
has come to connote ideas of su-
perficiality and hurtful exclusivi-
ty; the modern-day “sorority girl” 
character description is one of 
designer shoes, blonde hair and 
pricey athletic wear. 

I wish I could say I haven’t sub-

scribed to the wildly superficial 
makeup of the “sorority girl ste-
reotype,” and that, as a feminist, I 
have been able to reject the anti-
girl sentiment that this stereotype 
and its reduction of young women 
into a shopping-list type of description 
inherently carry. But, last week, just one 
day after Washtenaw County instated the 
campus-wide stay-at-home order, I saw 
a group of four female students conven-
ing in the Michigan Union’s Sweetwaters. 
And almost immediately, I found myself 
noting their sorority-like characteristics 
as if I were making some sort of tally:

Balenciaga sneakers: two pairs.
Lululemon leggings: three wearing 

them.

Patagonia backpacks: four on their 

backs.

I looked at this group of friends and did 

not register them as four women, or even 
four students, but, rather, four sorority 
girls. Observing them based on solely ma-
terialistic traits, I made a snap judgement 
before one of them even said anything 
about a sorority — which, eventually, one 
of them did. 

After about 30 minutes of chatting, 

they were asked to leave by a Sweetwa-
ters employee because they were infring-
ing upon the social-gathering regulations 
put in place by the recent executive order. 
I found myself shaking my head in bitter 
agreement with the employee, watching 
them leave the study space with their face 
masks hung flimsily around their wrists.

Serves them right, I thought. They’re 

the reason why we’re dealing with this 
stay-at-home order in the first place.

I looked down at the bright pink “femi-

nist” sticker emblazoned upon my plan-
ner and felt a sense of guilt settle in my 
stomach. The hypocrisy might as well 
have slapped me in the face. When did 
anti-sorority sentiment permeate such a 
basic level of my subconscious? Moreover, 
when did berating young women based 
purely on their social associations become 
OK?

Some might posit that the University of 

Michigan’s sororities’ uptick in bad press 
since the beginning of the pandemic has 
compounded a pre-existing anti-sorority 
sentiment on campus. Even before fall 
semester classes began, evidence of large 
and supposedly Fraternity & Sorority 
Life-affiliated social gatherings was gain-
ing substantial attention on social media. 
One picture depicting an outdoor gather-
ing in late August gained over 1,400 likes 
on Twitter, with commentators quick to 
associate the culprits with Phi Kappa 
Psi, a fraternity on the University’s Inter-
fraternity Council, though it’s unclear if 

the house actually belonged to members 
of that fraternity. One Twitter user re-
marked: “SO glad I never had a daughter,” 
presumably in response to the handful of 
female students shown in the photo.

One can observe that fraternity mem-

bers have received their share of pan-
demic-related policing via social media. A 
post on the popular “Overheard at umich” 
Facebook group criticized fraternity-af-
filiated parties being thrown mid-July: 
“...a bunch of fratboys having yet another 
party outside and endangering the gen-
eral public. So excited to start in person 
classes with these incredible careful and 
conscientious people!”

The Michigan Daily joined the nar-

rative of mid-pandemic fraternity criti-
cism with an article by columnist Elayna 
Swift discussing the ways in which Theta 
Chi’s partying habits demonstrated “dis-
appointing displays of entitlement and 
foolishness” that are “likely a result of 
Schlissel’s recent announcement to have 
an in-residence fall semester.”

Much of the public criticism surround-

ing the ways fraternities have (failed to) 
carry themselves in recent months em-
ploys action-based rhetoric: the frater-
nities’ actions rather than the brothers 
as individuals are being criticized. And 
rightfully so.

But when it comes to anti-Fraternity 

& Sorority Life sentiment based purely 
on individual, external attributes, like 
style or appearance, sorority girls have 
received a great deal more attention — 
which, frankly, represents a stark double 
standard in the ways we apply Fraternity 
& Sorority Life stereotypes on campus. 

If you haven’t heard of the “copy, paste” 

joke surrounding tribes of sorority girls, 
then you’ve likely seen the infamous pho-
to from The Daily that motivated it. The 
picture, which has gained over 2,900 likes 
on Instagram, shows a group of supposed 
sorority girls making the honorable pil-
grimage toward Welcome Week fraternity 
parties this August. Even before the pan-
demic, these parties have garnered a great 
deal of controversy in their own right for 
being hotspots of sexual assault and sexu-
al coercion.

The comment section under this partic-

ular photo reads like a brutal high school 
group chat:

“Greekazoids”
“Love the uniform”
“Lmao they got copy printed”
“Copy paste”

... Notice any overarching themes?
The “copy, paste” punchline, which em-

bodies the idea of sorority girls traveling 
in identical flocks, is not new. Earlier this 
year, a picture posted on Barstool Sports’ 
main Instagram of a huddle of female stu-
dents undergoing the rush process, all 
clad in black Canada Goose coats, gained 
over 280,000 likes.

The comment section isn’t subtle in its 

dehumanizing remarks:

“Look at all those chickens!”
“This is how (we) keep track of hens in 

public.”

The picture quickly circulated on the 

“Overheard at umich” Facebook group, 
with fellow University students hurling 
similar insults. One woman delivered the 
harshest blow:

“...It reminds me of the creation of dog 

breeds actually. Get enough that look sim-
ilar and boom, a new breed of (insert three 
Greek letters).”

First, I acknowledge how the Univer-

sity’s Panhellenic system carries an exten-
sive history of problematic, racially and 
physically discriminatory rush processes 
that lend themselves to constructing the 
sorority “breed” this Facebook user is 
referring to: a homogenous makeup of 
wealth, whiteness and thinness. 

But I must also acknowledge that in no 

circumstance should it be socially accept-
able to openly compare young women to 
dogs. And this is where I’ve seen produc-
tive, anti-sorority dialogue surrounding 
the system’s corruption become extreme-
ly destructive, anti-sorority girl dialogue 
— the same analysis that’s digested and 
manifested later by raging feminists like 
me, who can observe a group of perfectly 
friendly female students and automati-
cally cast judgement on them for being of 
that “type.” 

Assuming that this sector of female stu-

dents have been criticized enough for be-
ing a part of a system we know is corrupt, 
I wanted to hear from some of the mem-
bers themselves. 

In an email interview with The Daily, 

a member of one of the University’s Pan-
hellenic sororities who has chosen to keep 
her identity and sorority affiliation anon-
ymous for privacy concerns, expressed 
that she definitely recognizes the sorority 
stereotype being perpetuated on campus. 

“I feel like it is unfair, especially for 

those who don’t understand or are not in-
volved in the Panhellenic community,” she 
wrote. “Some of the stereotypes, at least 

from my experience, are not 
even close to the kind of love 
and genuine support I’ve 
received from this commu-
nity.”

As far as how this stereo-

type manifests itself in aca-
demic settings on campus, 
she noted that, “... some-
times the stereotypes may 
be that people in Greek life 
don’t focus on school, but 
that couldn’t be more of the 
opposite from what I’ve wit-
nessed. There are so many 
women excelling in their 
grades, including lots of 
women in STEM programs.”

This particular sorority 

member had also seen the 
notorious “copy, paste” pic-
ture that circulated on social 
media late August. 

“It is a little sad that this 

(photo) is being called a ‘so-
rority outing,’” she wrote. 
“First of all, there is no way 
to prove any of these women 
are involved in Greek Life, 
and many of the (Instagram) 
comments are based on the 

assumption of that. Secondly, if these in-
dividuals are freshmen, based on the sur-
vey presented in the (Instagram) caption, 
they wouldn’t be involved in Greek life 
yet, considering rush events do not start 
until Winter 2021.”

Essentially, this image depicts the kind 

of magic formula — tribe of females, crop 
tops and Air Force 1s — that immediately 
registered in our minds as “sorority girls,” 
despite the objective fact that these, pre-
sumably, first-year students wouldn’t 
have even started the rush process yet. 
Nevertheless, disregarding the actual or 
prospective sorority status of these young 
women, why does the sorority-girl as-
sumption immediately induce biting re-
proach? 

Does the harm exist in the mere label of 

being in a sorority?

Knowing that the sorority system ex-

tends across the United States, I was curi-
ous to know how the negative stereotypes 
attached to the sorority-girl label manifest 
themselves on other campuses beyond the 
University of Michigan’s. According to so-
rority members of Panhellenic chapters 
within Indiana University, which has a 
nearly-equivalent percentage of students 
involved in Fraternity & Sorority Life to 
that of the University of Michigan, the so-
cial impact of the sorority label can vary 
based on which sorority you are affiliated 
with. 

One member, who is quoted anony-

mously and omitted her sorority affilia-
tion due to privacy concerns, wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily that, on IU 
Bloomington’s campus, “I have met many 
people (...) who have said that I don’t come 
off as a stereotypical sorority girl to them. 
However, when people know of some of 
my sisters they are quick to say that I am 
such a (chapter name) sorority girl be-
cause of the sweet people they know who 
I am therefore associated with.”

This member has also observed the 

ways her sorority affiliation and the as-
sociated increased level of COVID-19 risk 
have affected the way she’s perceived by 
classmates. “The only setting in which 
Greek life has affected my reputation neg-
atively is in my classes this semester,” she 
wrote. “My classmates were just extreme-
ly worried about me spreading the virus 
to them.”

Dear U-M, 
give me a 
break

BY LEAH LESZCZYNSKI, 
STATEMENT COLUMNIST
H

alf of my 2020 Spring Break was spent on 

the beach. The other half was spent watch-

ing the dizzying news coverage on the CO-

VID-19 outbreak alongside the beginning of Trump’s 

failure to combat it. Though forever clouded by my 

grandparents’ fearful rush to return to their secluded 

Michigan farm for safety with the looming pandemic, I 

was lucky to have had a week of Florida sun in between 

an endless Midwestern winter and a busy semester in 

which I was taking 16 credits — looking back, I was lucky 

to just have a Spring Break, to have seven consecutive 

days off from school. This year, few, if any, college stu-

dents will have the same luxury.

During the typical academic year, University students 

receive a four-day Fall Break. This is not the typical 

school year, though. This year, seas of maize-clad fans 

will not pack the Big House and the fall semester began 

with 78% of undergraduate credits being offered online. 

Adding to the abnormalities, the recent increase in cases 

resulted in a stay-in-place order for U-M students was 

issued by the Washtenaw County Public Health Depart-

ment. This year has posed unforeseen, unprecedented 

obstacles for all groups, and students are no exception. 

While observing the tragic state of our nation, we are 

fighting for change, and juggling our online education 

and extracurriculars. However, October passed without 

the first Fall Break since its creation in 2002 and the Uni-

versity decided to scrap Spring Break during the winter 

semester in hopes of reducing student travel, and there-

fore curbing COVID-19 cases on campus.

Academic breaks arecrucial to student mental health, 

focus, productivity and overall well-being. LSA sopho-

more Brittany Hull shared her perspective on the lack of 

breaks for students during the 2020-2021 academic year. 

“This year, a break may be more essential than ever,” Hull 

said. “Even if it is not for us to go back home, just a break 

from classes would be beneficial. This is the most stress-
ful year I have ever had as a student. There are a lot of 

things going on in the world, and we are just expected to 

bear the weight of that.” 

LSA senior Larry Jia told The Daily he has used past 

Spring Breaks to travel to Florida and New York with his 

friends, but also spent the 2020 Spring Break catching up 

on work from his apartment on campus.

Indeed, there are many ways students spend their 

Spring Break. It grants time with friends and family, an 

opportunity to vacation, space to catch up on work, the 

ability to prepare for upcoming exams and participate 

in extracurricular activities or volunteer efforts, such 

as those made possible by the Alternative Spring Break 

program. Universities cite the spread of COVID-19 from 

student travel as the main reason to have canceled breaks 

this academic year. In Michigan, Michigan State Univer-

sity, Central Michigan University, Wayne State Univer-

sity and Grand Valley State University have all eliminat-

ed Spring Break, along with schools across the country 

including Penn State University, Purdue University, The 

Ohio State University, the University of Florida, the Uni-

versity of Kentucky and the University of Alabama.

Instead of a week off in the latter months of winter, 

schools are either tacking a week onto the end of Winter 

Break, and/or adding single days off in the middle of the 

week throughout the winter semester in hopes of pre-

venting students from travelling. As of now, Michigan 

State plans to give three days off, and Ohio State has add-

ed two days off to their academic calendar. Meanwhile, 

the University of Michigan has not added any days off to 

the Winter 2021 schedule.

Despite these attempts to ease the burden of living 

through a pandemic and attending college, students are 

voicing their concerns with the absence of typical breaks. 

A 
stu-

d e n t 

penned 

a letter 

to MSU 

P r e s i -

d e n t 

Stanley 

request-

ing that 

he 
re-

v e r s e 

his deci-

sion 
to 

c a n c e l 

s p r i n g 

b r e a k , 

reason-

ing that 

the cur-

rent situation is “exhausting far beyond the norm of col-

lege difficulty.”

Relatedly, a petition demanding a mental health break 

for Grand Valley students during the Winter 2021 semes-

ter has garnered over 4,000 signatures. In the comments, 

student signees cite mental health concerns, being be-

hind in classes and tanking grades as reasons for GVSU 

to add a break to next semester’s schedule. 

In response to the absence of breaks in the winter 

semester schedule, Central Student Government at the 

University of Michigan is working on a resolution urging 

the University to “implement a University-wide break on 

exams and other high stakes assignments (which [CSG 

defines] as contributing to 10% or more of a student’s 

final grade for a course) for one week during the Win-

ter 2021 semester.” The resolution explains that “classes 

will not be cancelled during this week, but the low stakes 
nature will engender the mental health benefits of the 

spring break for both students and teachers while still 

discouraging travel in light of COVID-19.”

Hull told The Daily that the resolution “sounds like a 

great initiative.” Citing the typical stressors

of student life that have been exacerbated by the pan-

demic, she told The Daily she “appreciates the effort to 

try and give students a break next semester.”

Not all students agree that the resolution will be effective. 

LSA junior Elizabeth Dickinson told The Daily she would 

prefer that professors have the ability to create their sched-

ule and spread out high-stakes assignments and exams to 

best fit the needs of their specific courses and students.

While the effectiveness and true benefits of the resolution 

remain to be seen if it is adopted, it seems that student orga-

nizations support the effort: over 100 have signed the resolu-

tion.

Despite the absence of a Fall and Spring Break, stu-

dents are embracing the flexibility of online classes to 

create their own vacations and breaks. I learned from 

talking to friends and scrolling through Instagram that 

students have taken trips to Florida and Chicago, visit-

ed other college campuses in search of parties and have 

rented cabins up north to find a temporary reprieve, de-

spite having to bring along laptops to attend class. Jia 

told The Daily he has observed this trend in his social 

circles.

“One of my friends has spent the past couple months 

driving across the country,” Jia said. “I do not know how 

they are managing that with coursework.” 

The fact that students with online classes are travel-

ing and interacting as they see fit during the pandemic 

indicates the weakness of the argument that eliminating 

breaks is an effective way to prevent the spread of coro-

navirus. It is understandable that schools have cancelled 

week-long breaks to discourage travel, but numerous 

universities have provided single days off throughout the 

semester in replacement. In contrast, the Winter 2021 

schedule is another failure of the University’s adminis-

tration to consider the health and well-being of students; 

the University has refused to grant a single weekday off 

throughout 14 weeks (a total of 98 days) of classes. 

Even when originally developing the fall break in 

2002, administrators and students acknowledged not all 

students would use the break with its intended purpose 

in mind: to study and catch up on work. Still, Fall Break 

was implemented and is regarded to serve a purpose for 

the mental health and well-being of students, regard-

less of how they personally choose to use the two days 

off. Relatedly, it is aggravating that the University has 

stripped all students of this break during the semester 

we arguably need it most.

The past few weeks have revealed the University can 

only control the activity and travel of students so much 

— regardless of the length or date of a break, students 

will use the time to spend it how they want, where they 

want — and that is not a reason to omit all breaks from 

the Winter 2021 semester, especially since students are 

already traveling across the country while classes are in 

session. And regardless of whether the CSG resolution 

is successful, the consensus among students is that any 

days off in the middle of the week is preferable none at 

all. 

“What about the people that are trying to do the right 

thing? What about the students that would stay and 

study, and use the extra time for the right things?” Dick-

inson asked.

“Even if they cannot send us home, there should be a 

mental break for us,” Hull said.

Putting the implications of an entire winter semester 

without a spring break into perspective, albeit lightly, Jia 

said, “Having 14 straight weeks of school is kind of ter-

rible.”

Regardless of the public health crisis, political ten-

sions, racial reckoning and economic instability of the 

United States, not to mention how these crises fuel each 

other, I think a couple days off this semester, and cer-

tainly next semester, are in order — we have days off dur-

ing “normal times.” With no clear idea on when or how 

the pandemic will end, it is likely the additional stressors 

of coronavirus will remain a tremendous added stressor 

for students well into next semester, and the University’s 

academic calendar should reflect students’ and faculty’s 

current circumstances. Many students are the most ex-

hausted, stressed and fearful we have ever been in our 

lives. So, can we get a break?

With his waiver approved, Chaundee Brown is finally ready to win

Chaundee Brown leaned back 
in his chair and smiled. 
Since 
transferring 
to 
Michigan from Wake Forest in 
May, Brown has been grounded 
in a perpetual state of limbo. 
The status of his waiver — which 
would determine his eligibility 
for the upcoming season — 
loomed over his head. 
On 
Friday, 
Brown’s 
wait 
ended. He secured the coveted 
waiver 
and, 
along 
with 
it, 
immediate eligibility. 
As Brown spoke to reporters 
on 
a 
Zoom 
call 
Monday 
afternoon, his words carried a 
certain ease to them, pointing to 
the weight that had been lifted 
off his shoulders. 
“It was a great feeling,” 
Brown said. “I’ve been waiting 
for it for a long time. Just been 
frustrated cause I’d like to know 
for a while, cause I didn’t know 
what position I was in, if I was 
gonna play this year.” 
As he embarks on his senior 
season, and his first in Ann 
Arbor, Brown is an accomplished 
college player. He is both battle-
tested, having been a three-
year starter in the notoriously 
difficult ACC, and dependable 
— he contributed 12.1 points per 
game last year, the third-highest 
mark on the team. He has five 
career double-doubles and 13 
20-point outings to his name. 
Yet on Brown’s resume, one 
item 
proves 
conspicuously 
absent: team success. 
During Brown’s Wake Forest 
tenure, the Demon Deacons 
posted a record of 35-58. They 
never finished higher than 11th 
in the conference and the NCAA 
Tournament was all but a pipe 
dream. 
When Brown committed to 
Wake Forest in the fall of 2016, 
he envisioned his career arc 
unfolding differently. The No. 
38 player in the country, Brown 
was the school’s highest-ranked 
commit since 2008. He turned 

down 
the 
likes 
of 
Kansas, 
Florida and Uconn to transform 
Wake Forest into a perennial 
contender and restore winning 
ways not seen since the days of 
Chris Paul. He believed in Danny 
Manning’s burgeoning program, 
which would go on to reach the 
NCAA Tournament for the first 
time since 2010 in the 2016-17 
season.
“He wanted to win,” former 
Wake Forest assistant coach 
Steve Woodberry said of Brown. 
“He wanted to come in and do 
something different and make 
his mark on the program.”
Brown did all he could to turn 
Wake Forest’s fortunes around, 
making himself amenable to any 
role that would help the team. 
Though a natural wing player, 
he frequently played power 

forward, chiseling his 6-foot-5 
frame and giving three inches to 
battle inside. He diversified his 
offensive game to shoulder the 
scoring load, offering an array 
of post-ups and three-pointers. 
On defense, he switched one 
through five. 
“We kinda moved him all 
over,” Woodberry said. 
“He had a willingness to 
do that, never batted an eye 
about it,” former Wake Forest 
associate 
head 
coach 
Rex 
Walters said. “It was, ‘What do 
I need to do to give us the best 
chance to have success?’ A lot of 
very talented players out there, 
they’re really not about winning. 
They’re about them. They’re 
about, ‘How do I play more, how 
do I get more shots?’ Chaundee, 
he wants to win.” 

Along the way, not once did 
Brown complain. Woodberry 
remembers often seeing Brown 
alone in the weight room, both 
before his teammates arrived 
and after they left. 
“He never cheated himself,” 
Woodberry said. “He came in 
and worked his butt off every 
day to get better as a player 
and to help the team get better. 
That’s just who he is. He wants 
to be great.”
Despite Brown’s best efforts, 
Wake Forest endured a trio of 
fruitless seasons. So in April, 
with one year of eligibility 
remaining, Brown pondered his 
future. He initially announced 
his intention to declare for 
the NBA Draft, but his name 
was absent from most mock 
drafts and, without an NCAA 

Tournament 
appearance, 
his 
collegiate career felt incomplete. 
Transferring was the next best 
option. 
On May 19, Brown committed 
to 
Michigan 
over 
Gonzaga, 
LSU, Illinois and Iowa State. 
Michigan’s winning pedigree 
stood out. He was also swayed in 
part by former Wolverine Colin 
Castleton, a fellow Florida native 
and childhood friend of Brown’s. 
Castleton, though transferring 
himself in April, had “nothing 
bad to say about Michigan.”
At long last ruled eligible, 
there is a sense of finality 
to Brown’s upcoming senior 
season. 
“This is his last shot as a 
college athlete,” Walters said. 
“With Chaundee, there’s no real 
agenda. There were never any 

agendas at Wake Forest except 
to help us win a ballgame, by 
any means necessary. … He 
wants to win badly. He’s willing 
to sacrifice his body, the effort, 
the energy, the enthusiasm. He’s 
willing to give all of that. He just 
wants to win.”
Michigan’s roster is more 
complete than Wake Forest’s 
ever was during Brown’s tenure. 
There are formidable pieces at 
every position. Brown won’t 
have to be the player he was at 
Wake Forest, forced out of his 
comfort zone or tasked as the 
lead scorer. He can revert to 
square one. 
“I can see myself helping this 
team this year by playing my 
game,” Brown, who has seen 
time at the ‘2’ and the ‘3’ in 
practice, said. “Coach (Juwan) 
Howard recruited me because 
he liked my game, so there’s no 
need to change it. Just got to be 
the player I am.”
At the end of Friday’s practice, 
Howard huddled the team at the 
end of the court, underneath 
the basket. He informed them 
that Brown’s waiver had been 
approved, prompting a raucous 
celebration 
— 
Brown 
was 
engulfed in a mosh pit by his 
teammates who pierced the air 
with euphoric screams. 
“It’s really a family here,” 
Brown said. “Everyone in the 
locker room gets along, we’re 
laughing and giggling and stuff 
like that. I’ve never had a team 
like this that’s so close and 
everything.”
Brown has also never been 
on a team so well-equipped 
to 
compete. 
After 
suffering 
through three losing seasons at 
Wake Forest and a five month 
wait for eligibility, he can hone 
in on all that matters to him: 
winning.
“My big goal is to win a 
Big Ten championship (and) 
national championship,” Brown 
said. “That’s everyone’s goal. But 
individual goals, I really put that 
to the side. I do anything to help 
the team out right now.”

Barnes Arico talks improvements

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
does 
not 
have an official schedule. The 
team doesn’t know what their 
season will look like. But they 
don’t care — they have ninth-
year coach Kim Barnes Arico 
to lead them through the 
uncertainty. 
Ignoring outside noise about 
what the season will look like, 
Barnes Arico says that the 
team is working on improving 
in categories where it fell short 
last year. The Wolverines shot 
32.8% from behind the arc last 
season but only averaged 4.8 
3-point attempts per game. 
“I think we’ve worked a 
ton in the offseason on our 
outside shooting. You know, 
we weren’t a team that made a 
ton of threes last year. I think 
that’s an area where we’re 
going to improve this season,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I think 
we’re going to shoot more of 
them and I think we’re going 
to make more of them.”
In an abnormal season, it 
helps that the Wolverines have 

a lot of experience returning 
to the court. Junior forward 
Naz Hillmon, junior guard 
Amy Dilk, fifth-year guard 
Akienreh Johnson, and senior 
forward Hailey Brown were 
starters last year and will be 
playing for Michigan in the 
upcoming season. 
The Wolverines also add 
junior guard Leigha Brown, 
who received a waiver for 
immediate 
eligibility 
on 
Sunday, to their roster after 
she transferred from Nebraska 
this offseason. Brown led the 
Huskers in scoring last season, 
averaging 14.4 points per game 
while shooting 34.1% from 
behind the arc and 43.6% on 
total field goals. With such 
a formidable stat-line, she 
should be able help Michigan 
improve its scoring abilities 
and could make an immediate 
impact.
On a bench with as much 
experience as the Wolverines, 
Barnes 
Arico 
said 
new 
freshmen may take on more of 
a learning role, but she didn’t 
deny the talented young group 
of freshmen their credit.
“I 
think 
that 
makes 
it 
even 
more 
difficult, 
being 

a freshman coming in and 
trying to make an immediate 
impact when you have a ton of 
experience (already),” Barnes 
Arico said. “ … I don’t know 
if any of them will come in 
and play 30 minutes a game, 
kind of like Naz was able to 
do her freshman year, but I 
think all four of them have an 
opportunity to be great players 
in a Michigan uniform.”
With solid experience and 
leadership at the top of the 
roster and a strong group of 
underclassmen who are eager 
to learn, the Wolverines seem 
positioned to compete for a Big 
Ten championship. 
But first, they have to make 
it through the uncertainty of 
the preseason.
“The new word of the year 
is fluid. (The upcoming season 
is) fluid, it’s ever changing,” 
Barnes Arico said. “You need 
to be adaptable and you also 
need to be willing to change 
and 
to 
make 
adjustments.
We might not have wanted 
this to happen. … Now, how 
are we going to spin that into 
a positive and how are we 
going to make the best of that 
situation.” 

Pearson may not let Power go to 
Canada Junior Selection Camp

Owen Power’s first game in 
a Michigan jersey may have to 
wait a little longer.
On Oct. 29, the freshman 
defenseman was announced as 
one of the 46 players invited 
to Canada’s National Junior 
Team Selection Camp. The 
camp will run from Nov. 16 
through Dec. 13 in Red Deer, 
Alberta. If Power attends, the 
first month of his season — 
which begins the weekend of 
Nov. 13 — will effectively be 
wiped out.
But there’s no guarantee 
that 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson will allow Power to 
attend.
In a normal year, Power 
would miss very little, if any, 
of the Wolverines’ season. The 
camp normally begins in the 
middle of December and only 
lasts two weeks, during which 
no college games are played. 
But 
because 
Canadian 
junior 
leagues 
have 
delayed 
their 
seasons and are 
not 
currently 
playing 
games, 
the 
camp 
has 
been 
extended, 
overlapping 
with the college 
season.
If 
the 
camp 
were to start in 
December, 
Pearson 
would 
likely let Power go — he allowed 
both 
former 
defenseman 
Quinn Hughes and sophomore 
defenseman Cam York to do so 
in their respective freshman 
years. But the early start 
complicates his decision.
“It’s not the ideal situation,” 
Pearson said. “I would like to 
let Owen experience it and go 
there, but at the same time, 
I’ve got to look at the overall 
picture and what’s right for 
Owen going forward, overall, 
not just for a two week camp 
that’s played at Christmas 

time, 
but 
for 
his 
overall 
growth and development and 
academic interest.”
While 
on 
the 
surface 
this 
seems 
like 
a 
hockey 
decision, academics will play 
a significant role for Pearson 
this year, since Power will 
have to take classes while in a 
bubble in Alberta.
“Even 
though 
I 
think all of 
his 
classes 
are 
Zoom 
classes, 
we 
just 
wanted 
to see what 
his workload 
was going to 
be 
because 
he could be 
gone 51 days,” 
Pearson said. 
“If you make that team, you’re 
gonna be gone 51 days — 51 
days in a bubble in Alberta.”
While the World Junior 
Championships 
provide 
players with the opportunity 
to compete against the best 
players in the world between 
the ages of 18 and 20, according 
to Pearson, it’s not always 
beneficial 
for 
players 
like 
Power to go. In 2018, Hughes 
played just over 13 minutes a 
game at the tournament, fifth 
among defensemen on the U.S. 
team, while York served as the 
seventh defenseman for the 

U.S. last year.
“We’ve had a lot of players 
go and it’s been a tough 
experience and you’ve got 
to 
come 
back 
with 
their 
confidence rattled a little bit,” 
Pearson said. “We got to build 
them back up.”
Even though Power would 
be playing for the Canadian 
team, he could face a situation 
similar to what Hughes and 
York 
faced. 
Power 
is 
the 
youngest of the 15 defensemen 
invited to the camp, and the 
only one who is yet to be 
drafted. Six of the defensemen 
were first round picks in either 
2019 or 2020, and as a result, 
Power could be facing an 
uphill battle for playing time.
All 
things 
considered, 
staying 
and 
going 
both 
have their own benefits and 
drawbacks. Whatever decision 
Pearson makes, it will have 
considerable ramifications for 
the start of the Wolverines’ 
season. The Athletic’s Corey 
Pronman ranked Power as 
the second best prospect in 
the 2021 NHL draft, and he 
figures to fill a spot as a top-
four defenseman for Michigan 
this season.
“I wish I didn’t have to 
make a tough decision like I’m 
probably going to have to,” 
Pearson said. “But he’s here to 
go to school and play hockey, 
not just the hockey.”

Secondary 
exposed in 
loss

Saturday afternoon in Ann Arbor, 
beneath a green gaiter that served to 
maintain his poker face, Mel Tucker 
wouldn’t reveal whether he intentionally 
designed a game plan to pepper Michigan’s 
cornerbacks with targets deep downfield.
He didn’t need to. The proof was there 
for three hours Saturday. It resided outside 
the visiting locker room, down the white 
stucco hallway and on the Michigan 
Stadium field.
That’s 
where 
Michigan 
State 
quarterback Rocky Lombardi — fresh off 
a three-turnover performance against 
the Big Ten’s perennial doormat, Rutgers 
— threw for 323 yards, 196 of them to 
freshman receiver Ricky White, who saw 
a 40-fold increase in his career receiving 
yardage.
“We’ve got a bunch of playmakers,” 
Lombardi said. “You’re gonna have to 
cover all of them.”
On Saturday, Michigan opted for the 
opposite.
White was the primary benefactor, 
connecting with Lombardi eight times. 
Junior Jalen Nailor — with his 328 career 
receiving yards — was another, going for 68 
yards. Running back Connor Heyward was 
there too, only catching two balls, but both 
for touchdowns.
At the end of it, the Wolverines’ 
cornerbacks could only look up at a 
scoreboard that read: Michigan State 27, 
Michigan 24, and wonder how they got 
there.
“Each person, we gotta look at that, 
every single guy, what they can do and 
what they can do better,” Harbaugh said 
when asked about the unit. “And every 
coach, too.”
For Michigan, the performance stood in 
direct contrast to everything it showed a 
week ago in Minneapolis. Back then, seven 
days and a lifetime ago, junior cornerbacks 
Vincent Gray and Gemon Green held the 
Big Ten’s reigning receiver of the year, 
Rashod Bateman, out of the end zone on 
101 yards, most of them in garbage time.
On the first drive of the game Saturday, 
it looked like the Wolverines could be in for 
a repeat. Green, who was lauded all week 
for his performance as a first-time starter, 
forced a three-and-out with a well timed 
pass breakup on the left sideline.
That would be the highlight of his game.
On the next drive, Green made the 
mistake he carefully avoided against 
Minnesota, failing to turn his head in one-
on-one coverage against White on a go 
route down the left sideline. Instead, Green 
only stared towards White, who streaked 
past him into the end zone, catching 
Michigan State’s first touchdown of the 
game.
The Spartans’ next touchdown came 
from the two-yard line, but it too was 
sparked by the deep ball. This time, it was 
Gray getting beat on the right sideline. 
Fooled by a rudimentary stop-and-go 
move, he stopped in his tracks at midfield 
as Nailor ran free under Lombardi’s 
53-yard pass.
Five plays later, Michigan State was in 
the end zone.
“We really didn’t expect those (deep 
throws) because the gameplan was to hone 
in on the run,” sophomore safety Daxton 
Hill said. “But they threw some shots in 
there so you just have to adjust.”
So at halftime, that’s what Michigan 
tried to do. Defensive coordinator Don 
Brown dropped his safeties deeper into 
coverage, attempting to provide help for his 
outmatched cornerbacks. Midway through 
the third quarter, he opted for a personnel 
change, replacing Gray with sophomore 
Jalen Perry.
“We were making adjustments and they 
were…” Harbaugh said, letting his voice 
trail off with the knowledge of what came 
next.
What came next was a second half in 
which Lombardi threw for 227 yards, 
including 121 on downfield passes into one-
on-one coverage. Perry, for his part, joined 
the struggles, falling over his own feet on a 
31-yard completion to White at the three-
yard line that all but sealed the game.
The most damning play, though, came a 
quarter earlier, with Lombardi backed up 
against his own end zone. Facing a second-
and-9 with a heavy rush from Michigan 
and White lined up against Gray on the 
right sideline, he dropped back and hurled 
a pass 40 yards downfield, hoping his 
freshman could come up with it.
There was no double move or play-
action. There were no suppositions about 
what else Michigan State might do. The 
Spartans were dialing up what had worked 
all game: Make Michigan’s cornerbacks 
win a battle.
And with the opportunity to shift 
momentum in the Wolverines’ hands, 
they couldn’t do it. Gray got beat, senior 
safety Brad Hawkins couldn’t get over in 
time and Michigan, for the third time in 
the Harbaugh era, walked off its own field 
with a loss to its in-state rivals.

S

ame. Old. Michigan.
Maybe even a little bit 
worse.
A 
week 
after 
the 
Wolverines defied expectations, went 
on the road and beat a ranked team 
and looked like a Big Ten contender, 
they suffered the 
worst loss of Jim 
Harbaugh’s tenure 
as head coach. One 
step forward. Two 
steps back.
Everything 
about 
Saturday’s 
loss was avoidable 
and self-wrought. 
There 
was 
no 
talent deficit in 
this 
game. 
The 
Spartans are in transition, in their first 
year under a new head coach after a 
season in which they were lucky to 
make the Pinstripe Bowl. They lost to 
Rutgers just a week ago. This might 
well be their only win of the season.
That it came in Ann Arbor, against 
their in-state rivals, in a game where 
the Wolverines were favored by over 
20 points, is a stunning indictment 
of everything about Jim Harbaugh’s 
program in year six of his tenure.
“Feels unreal, honestly,” junior 
running back Hassan Haskins said. “I 
can’t believe it right now. It don’t feel 
real right now.”
The Wolverines gave up 86 penalty 
yards on Saturday. They gave up 323 
yards in the air and five plays of 30 
yards or more, as a Michigan State 
passing attack that has been ridiculed 
across the state was too much to handle. 
In the fourth quarter, with the game 
on the line, they looked too gassed to 
compete on a 92-yard touchdown drive 
then proceeded to take five minutes off 
the clock, dinking and dunking their 
way to a meaningless touchdown with 
all the urgency the situation would 
have required in the blowout this game 
was supposed to be.
Michigan State 27. Michigan 24. 
It’s rock bottom for the Wolverines 
under Harbaugh, and it’s time for this 
fanbase to start reflecting on what it 

wants out of this arrangement.
“Team 
is 
gonna 
own 
this,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Congratulations 
to Michigan State but we gotta own 
the loss and come back and find out 
where we can improve. This is a high-
character team and I believe they’ll 
do just that. Each person looking at 
themselves, player, coach, all of us and 
strive to be a lot better.”
After past disappointments against 
Ohio State, bowl opponents and even 
Michigan State, it was easy for locals 
to dismiss the national voices calling 
for Harbaugh’s removal. Competing 
with Ohio State every year might not 
be realistic for this program right 
now. The Spartans were a bona fide 
contender when Harbaugh came in. 
But right now, they’re a bottom-feeder 
in the midst of a rebuild. 
Michigan simply cannot lose to 
them. 
Harbaugh is the fourth-highest paid 
coach in college football, according to 
USA Today’s annual salary disclosure. 
A $7.78 million salary demands more 
than butts in the seats, donations and a 
high graduation rate. Especially, by the 
way, if Harbaugh is marching on the 
school president to demand a season.
At a bare minimum, it demands 
taking care of business as a three-
touchdown favorite over your in-state 
rival. Not messing around with the 
wildcat in the red zone when you 
have a running quarterback, costing 
yourself four points and then losing by 
three.
“Close, thought it was a good 
playcall,” Harbaugh said, “and just 
needed a little bit more pipe on the 
throw.”
Of course, the quarterback might 
have been able to make a better throw.
Those gimmicks fly when you’re 
winning. But when you need to pull out 
a win, getting cute with the wildcat, 
with two kickers on the field for an 
onside attempt, with last season’s 
doomed two-quarterback package, 
is overthinking at best, desperate at 
worst.
The offense, as Harbaugh said, 
never found a consistent rhythm. 

After 
a 
first-quarter 
touchdown 
drive in which everything hummed, 
reminiscent of last week at Minnesota, 
the Wolverines struggled to put 
together another drive.
“I 
was 
thinking 
too 
much,” 
quarterback Joe Milton said. “I was 
too busy with my feet. It was all on me. 
O-Line did great.”
It’s admirable that Milton would 
take the blame, and true that there 
were clear areas in which he needs to 
improve. But Michigan, up and down 
the roster, didn’t come ready to play. 
And for that, the blame lies at the top.
Harbaugh is due for an extension 
after this season — his contract is 
already past the point where most 
coaches would have negotiated one. 
After this, is Michigan supposed to 
give him a raise? In the midst of a 
pandemic that’s seen layoffs in the 
athletic department?
Surely not.
It’s time to think long and hard 
about whether this is what the 
Wolverines want to be. Eight or nine 
wins every year, sometimes 10. Little 
chance of beating Ohio State. More 
disappointing losses than upset wins. 
And no chance — none — of a Big Ten 
title. 
Michigan will likely never be 
a yearly CFP contender in college 
football’s current environment. But it’s 
no longer true to say that no other coach 
can get the Wolverines to where they 
are now. Tom Allen nearly has Indiana 
there with far fewer resources. Kirk 
Ferentz’s Iowa finished a game better 
than Michigan last season. And that’s 
just coaches within the Wolverines’ 
own conference.
Harbaugh deserves plaudits for 
pulling Michigan out of Brady Hoke’s 
abyss. Much of the sniping over the last 
six years has been unwarranted. And 
maybe it’s all different if a call goes 
their way in Columbus four years ago. 
But this is on the verge of stalling out. 
And if Harbaugh can’t fix it, maybe 
it’s time to think about giving someone 
else a chance.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has lost at home to Michigan State three times in his six years as head coach of the Wolverines.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
The Michigan State football team scored an upset win on Saturday, beating Michigan 27-24 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.

‘M’ learns 
not to 
discount 
rival

The leadup to rivalry week couldn’t 
have gone any more different for the 
two teams.
Jim Harbaugh, as always, answered 
questions diplomatically. The Spartans 
weren’t going to turn the ball over seven 
times against Michigan, he said. His 
team would be ready. But the questions 
about 
the 
rivalry 
seemed 
almost 
farcical. Michigan State, after all, 
had just lost to Rutgers, snapping the 
Scarlet Knights’ 21-game conference 
losing streak.
Mel Tucker, the new kid on the 
block, needed to show how much this 
rivalry meant to him. He took a page 
from Ohio State’s playbook, referring to 
the Wolverines as “the team down the 
road.” At the time, it seemed desperate, 
like a coach trying to prove he cared 
about the game he was almost certain 
to lose.
For a week, you could talk yourself 
into believing this rivalry had lost its 
luster. Yes, it was still a big game, but 
this felt like two teams in two different 
places. Michigan, which had won its 
road opener decisively, and Michigan 
State, which had just shown how bare 
Mark Dantonio left the cupboard when 
he retired in February.
But it’s hard to imagine a better 
introduction to the rivalry for Tucker 
than this one, because it proved that the 
thing that makes this rivalry one of the 
best in college football is still as true as 
ever: Anything can happen when it’s 
Michigan and Michigan State.
So maybe it shouldn’t have been 
that shocking when the Spartans were 
the team doing jumping jacks on the 
sideline, the team that ran into the 
tunnel celebrating after a 27-24 win.
“We expected it,” Michigan State 
quarterback Rocky Lombardi said. 
“I know we were three-touchdown 
underdogs but everybody on this team 
knew going into the game that we had 
a chance and we had a good chance. 
So that was part of the reason why we 
played with so much confidence and 
ended up getting the win.”
Most of these games are punctuated 
by the strangest plays imaginable — 
botched snaps and monsoons and 
pregame antics and turnovers. This one 
felt almost normal by comparison, as 
normal as any game played without fans 
due to a pandemic can be. Neither team 
turned the ball over, the special teams 
were fine, the weather was a perfectly 
crisp 45 degrees.
The Wolverines can’t put this one 
on a handful of once-in-a-lifetime 
plays. They got outplayed on their 
own turf. Their secondary had no 
answer 
for 
Lombardi’s 
downfield 
heaves. They committed too many 
penalties, got too cute with their goal-
line wildcat packages and couldn’t find 
success in their running game. Here, 
their biggest mistake may have been 
underestimation.
“We wanted to win, bad. Beat them 
up by a lot,” junior running back Hassan 
Haskins said. “There wasn’t no” — 
Haskins emitted a deep sigh — “no lack 
of confidence or anything. We wanted 
to get in there and do our job and do 
it well and just smash them for real. 
Anything can happen.”
When junior quarterback Joe Milton 
spoke after the game, he blamed 
himself for the result and noted that the 
Spartans didn’t do anything he didn’t 
expect. This, he said, was a simple lack 
of execution. But when asked what 
he’d heard about linebacker Antjuan 
Simmons — a second-year starter and 
All-Big Ten honorable mention last year 
— Milton asked, “Who?” When given a 
description, Milton said that he “wasn’t 
really worried about him, man. He’s a 
heck of a player but wasn’t on my radar.”
Simmons, of course, had a clapback.
“It don’t matter, Pauly B’s back with 
us, so I don’t know what those guys do 
over there but we study our opponents, 
we know who we’re playing against, so 
I don’t care if I’m on Joe Milton’s radar 
or not.”
Of course, the loss can’t be blamed 
on just one player. Milton wasn’t nearly 
as good as he was last week against 
Minnesota, but the real issue was that 
the whole team came out flat. The team 
that won in Minneapolis last week was 
crisp, prepared and ready to play.
Somehow, against the Spartans, it 
didn’t seem that way.
“We had confidence. We knew we 
had the game, it’s just lack of focus 
or something,” Haskins said. “I don’t 
know. We had it, we just, we beat 
ourselves.”

Michigan emphasizes bouncing back

Following 
arguably 
the 
worst loss to date of Jim 
Harbaugh’s six-year tenure, the 
schedule doesn’t get any easier 
for the Michigan football team.
As 
Harbaugh 
and 
his 
players addressed the media 
on Monday, one of the most 
commonly used phrases was 
“bounce back.” With teams 
like Ohio State, Wisconsin 
and Penn State still ahead, the 
23rd-ranked Wolverines will 
be forced to do exactly that if it 
wants to avoid embarrassment.
And with a trip to No. 13 
Indiana on tap this week, 
they’ll have to do it sooner 
than later. 
“(Bouncing back) is huge,” 
fifth-year senior Carlo Kemp 
said. “And it’s definitely the 
only way in football to move 
on and erase things that have 
happened in the past. It’s not 
basketball or baseball where 
you’ve got to have a seven 
game series. You get your one 
Saturday, you get your one 
opportunity 
and 
your 
one 
chance to go out there and 
play and walk away with a win. 
Saturday, we didn’t do that, so 
that’s the only thing that’s kind 
in the back of your head and on 
your mind.

“The only way to erase that 
is to go out there as hard as you 
can on this coming Saturday 
and win. Walk away with a win 
because now, going into the 
stretch of games that we have 
coming up with already one 
loss, every game is so crucial. 
The impact it can make on 
(our) season — win or lose — is 
huge.”
After falling short against a 
Michigan State team fresh off a 
loss to lowly Rutgers, bouncing 
back is easier said than done. 
The Wolverines’ flaws were 
exposed in their loss, most 
notably on the defensive side of 
the ball.
Cornerbacks 
Vincent 
Gray and Gemon Green were 
consistently 
beat 
over 
the 
top, but even as the Spartans’ 
game 
plan 
became 
clear, 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown made minimal in-game 
adjustments. 
Instead, 
he 
relied on a man coverage 
scheme that surrendered 196 
receiving yards to Michigan 
State freshman Ricky White 
— the most by a Spartan 
against Michigan since Plaxico 
Burress tallied 255 in 1999.
“Definitely talk to the young 
corners,” 
senior 
linebacker 
Josh Ross said. “The main 
thing I tell them is, it’s tough, 
we made some mistakes, we 

have some tough plays, but 
at the end of the day, a man 
is judged by how he faces 
adversity and tough situations. 
… We will bounce back strong.”
The secondary wasn’t the 
only unit that struggled. The 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
line 
made little impact up front, 
and by the end of the afternoon, 
Michigan didn’t have a single 
sack or turnover in a game it 
entered as a three-touchdown 
favorite.
The Hoosiers, meanwhile, 
could prove to be the young 
season’s tallest task yet. After 
upsetting Penn State in the 
season-opener, they cruised 
to a 16-point win over Rutgers 
on Saturday. The Wolverines 
have won 24 straight against 
Indiana dating back to 1988, 
but they’ll need more than just 
history on their side to keep 
the streak alive.
This time, they’ll need a 
bounce-back effort.
“The only thing that’s gonna 
get the sour taste out of our 
mouths is winning the next 
game,” senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks said. “That’s how 
we’re gonna approach it and 
that’s how everyone’s mindset 
is right now. … Anybody’s 
allowed to get beat. It’s up to 
us to fine-tune the details and 
be able to execute.”

J

oe Milton sat down 
in front of the camera 

and 
adjusted 
his hair. He 
stayed 
quiet 
and stared.
“They didn’t 
do 
anything 
that we didn’t 
practice,” 
he 
said, 
answering 
the 
first 
question of an uncomfortable 
eight minutes. “I was thinking 
too much. I was too busy with my 
feet. It was all on me.”
There’s 
some 
truth 
there. 
Milton went 32-of-51 and threw 
for 300 yards on Saturday with 

zero 
touchdowns 
and 
zero 
interceptions. On paper, it’s about 
mediocre. Watching the game, it 
was a bit worse. 
Milton looked uncomfortable 
in the pocket; he got sacked just 
once but struggled to get past his 
first read. More than once, he 
tried to force balls into windows 
that were too tight, seeming 
to predetermine where he was 
going before the snap and failing 
to adjust. And more than that, 
he was lucky to avoid throwing 
an interception. The accuracy 
issues we’ve heard about for a 
long time showed up, especially 
on downfield throws, and by the 
end of the game, Michigan was 
attempting to run a two-minute 
drill by checking the ball down. 
The 27-24 loss to Michigan 

State wasn’t all Milton’s fault. 
He had nothing to do with the 
penalty yards Michigan’s defense 
racked up or with Michigan 
State receiver Ricky White’s 196 
yards against an overmatched 
secondary. He didn’t make the 
decision to go to the wildcat near 
the goal-line when the offense 
was humming. 
Still, after a strong performance 
against Minnesota, this will 
bring expectations for Michigan’s 
junior quarterback back down to 
earth. He wasn’t the reason they 
lost, but that doesn’t mean there 
was a shortage of issues.
“My take of it right now until 
I rewatch it, we would be in 
rhythm and we wouldn’t or we 
wouldn’t be in rhythm and then 
we’d get it,” Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh said. “Didn’t finish 
the drives and be in rhythm 
throughout the drive like we 
wanted to.”
At 
least 
some 
of 
the 
responsibility there falls on the 
quarterback’s shoulders, since 
he’s the one leading the offense 
on the field, and Milton should 
get 
credit 
for 
bearing 
that 
responsibility without hesitation.
What 
matters 
more 
now, 
though, is next week. 
How Milton plays on the road, 
coming off a crushing loss against 
a challenging Indiana defense, 
could set the tone for the rest of 
this season. 
The Wolverines opened as 
a favorite at Indiana, but the 
Hoosiers were ranked 10 spots 
higher in the AP Poll. That’s 

the first time Indiana has been 
ranked higher than Michigan 
coming into this game since 
1988, per Matt Cohen of the 
Indiana Daily Student. And if the 
Wolverines want to get anything 
at all out of this season, it’s a 
must-win game.
For Milton, this is also about 
keeping his job next year, when 
five-star recruit J.J. McCarthy 
comes in and Cade McNamara 
enters his junior year. But that’s 
getting ahead of ourselves.
As for immediate ramifications, 
Wisconsin, Penn State and Ohio 
State are all still on the schedule. 
Indiana is perennially penciled in 
as an automatic win. But not this 
year. And a loss would put a .500 
record — Michigan’s worst season 
since Brady Hoke was fired — on 

the table.
Milton took responsibility and 
pinpointed where he needs to 
improve minutes after Saturday’s 
game. He talked about being 
more comfortable in the pocket, 
staying poised, keeping his focus 
and being too busy with his feet. 
Asked about Michigan State 
linebacker 
Antjuan 
Simmons, 
who made 11 tackles and affected 
the game all day, he said, “Antuan 
Simmons, who’s that?” It pointed 
to another problem — a lack of 
preparation — even if Milton 
didn’t say it aloud.
That’s a laundry list of things 
to improve on. Whether he can do 
it in five days will be telling.

Bob Shoop not coaching on-field, 
Aashon Larkins coaching safeties

Safeties coach Bob Shoop is 
not actively coaching at this 
time, the team confirmed in a 
statement Monday morning.
“Bob Shoop is not working 
with the team in an on-field 
coaching 
capacity 
at 
this 
time,” a spokesperson said in 
a statement. “He is performing 
team-related duties remotely. 
In consideration of his privacy 
interests, we will have no 
further comment.”
Aashon Larkins, a defensive 
analyst, 
is 
currently 
doing 
on-field work with the safeties, 
the spokesperson confirmed.
“Aashon Larkins is coaching 
the safeties,” Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh said at his press 
conference. “And doing a good 
job. And yeah, we’ve adjusted 
as best we can.”
The 
reason 
for 
Shoop’s 
absence is unknown. Rivals 
first 
reported 
that 
Shoop 
wasn’t working on-field.
Asked 
to 
elaborate, 
Harbaugh 
referred 
media 
back to the statement, citing 
confidentiality.
Shoop, a former defensive 
coordinator 
at 
William 
& 
Mary, Vanderbilt, Penn State, 
Tennessee 
and 
Mississippi 
State, was hired in January 
after Chris Partridge left for 
Ole Miss.
“Getting 
to 
know 
coach 
Shoop is a great guy, great 
coach — an even better person,” 

senior safety Brad Hawkins 
said this fall. “He knows a lot 
of football. He’s been around 
it, the game, a long time. I’m 
just happy to learn from a new 
guy, learn new things from a 
new person. It’s just something 
that’s helping me elevate my 
game.
“He’s been around a lot of 
great 
safeties. 
He 
coached 
(NFL safety) Adrian Amos. He 
coached some great guys. I’m 
happy to be around him and 
I’m happy to learn from him.”
Asked whether Shoop would 
return to the field this season, 
Harbaugh didn’t answer.
“I would refer you back to the 
statement and can’t comment 
on things that are of a private 
nature,” Harbaugh said.
