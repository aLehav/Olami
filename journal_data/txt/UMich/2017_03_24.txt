KANSAS 
CITY, 
Mo. 
— 

With nine seconds left and the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
down by one, Derrick Walton 
Jr. received the inbounds pass 
looking for a shot that would lead 
the Wolverines to the Elite Eight.

And with two seconds left, 

the senior guard got his chance, 
jab-stepping his defender and 
stepping back for a 3-point 
attempt.

But unlike so many of Walton’s 

shots in Michigan’s seven-game 
undefeated run, the ball fell just 
short, clanking off the front iron 
as the buzzer sounded.

“I thought (the shot) was 

good,“ 
said 
junior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson. “That’s a shot 
that I’ve seen him make over 
and over, and I have the utmost 
confidence in him to make that 
shot.”

That was it, as the Wolverines’ 

season ended with a 69-68 loss to 
Oregon (16-2 Pac-12, 32-5 overall) 
at the Sprint Center on Thursday 
night.

But for a game that featured 

two of the top-20 scoring offenses 
in the country, it sure didn’t feel 
like it. The two teams combined 
for just 68 points in the first half of 
a game that was tightly contested 
down to the final buzzer.

The first half was marred 

by 
off-the-mark 
shooting 
— 

Michigan (10-8 Big Ten, 26-12 
overall) shot just 39 percent on 
11-of-28 shooting, while Oregon 

shot just 41 percent on 12-of-29 
shooting — and general lackluster 
play.

“We talked to people who play 

(Oregon) often, and they said 
‘We don’t know what they’re 
doing, we don’t have a formula 
for it,’ ” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “It’s just this off 
formation of zone defense.”

The Wolverines, who had 

given up just 10 turnovers in their 
past two games, turned the ball 

over seven times in the first half, 
allowing Oregon to run out in 
transition, a big part of the Ducks’ 
game plan.

Senior guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. was his usual self with a stat 
line of 11 points, two rebounds 
and seven assists in the first half, 
but he had little help from his 
teammates. Walton finished with 
a strong second half, totaling 20 
points, five rebounds and eight 
assists.

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner, who had 26 points 
in 
Michigan’s 
victory 
over 

Louisville just four days prior, 
was off the mark, totaling just 
four points on 2-of-8 shooting in 
the first half. Wagner’s second 
half wasn’t much better, as he 
played eight minutes and scored 
three points.

But as poor as the offense 

looked, 
Michigan’s 
defense 

Ann Arbor City Council’s 

March 5 decision to contract 
Hillard 
Heintze 
LLC, 
a 

Chicago-based 
security 

consulting firm, to review 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
practices elicited a variety of 
responses from Ann Arbor 
students, activists and other 
stakeholders.

The decision to audit the 

police 
department 
was 
a 

result of two and a half years 
of protests and complaints 
regarding the Aura Rosser 
case, in which a Black woman 
was shot by a white police 
officer, David Ried, who was 
responding 
to 
a 
domestic 

violence call.

Prosecuting attorney Brian 

Mackie said in a statement in 
Jan. 2015 no criminal charges 
will be brought against Ried, 
citing “lawful self-defense,” 
but 
activists 
across 
Ann 

Arbor 
have 
advocated 
for 

more 
police 
accountability 

and transparency to 
avoid 

another incident. For example,

Mark Schlissel, president 

of the University of Michigan, 
emphasized the importance 
of 
international 
students 

and the global economy in 
a 
Detroit 
News 
editorial 

co-authored with Lou Anna 
Simon, president of Michigan 
State University, and M. Roy 
Wilson, president of Wayne 
State University, on Thursday.

The three presidents wrote 

they believe it is essential 
to keep their doors open to 
foreign students, because it 
will lead to enhanced growth 
in Michigan’s innovation and 
economic growth.

“Our research universities 

give the people and businesses 
of our state an advantage in the 
global innovation economy,” 
Schlissel, Simon and Wilson 
wrote. “Keeping our doors 
open to the global community 
of scholars will enhance our 
ability to compete and power 
Michigan’s future.”

They also wrote more than 

10 percent of students at their 
respective 
colleges 
come 

from foreign countries and 
Michigan’s economy retains 
much of their talent after they 
graduate.

“While the vast majority of 

our students come from the 
state of Michigan, we also 
attract more than 10 percent 
from 
foreign 
countries,” 

Schlissel, Simon and Wilson 
wrote. 
“And 
those 
who 

remain in the U.S. to work 
after graduation are nearly as 
likely as domestic students to 
stay in Michigan.”

Schlissel, 
Simon 

and 
Wilson 
also 
wrote 

international

contribute to diversity at each 
of their respective colleges

City hosts town hall, discusses

The speakers discussed different methods to prevent negative effects of gerrymandering

More than 100 community 

members gathered in a room 
Thursday night at the University 
of Michigan School of Social 
Work to attend one in a series 
of town halls organized by two 
grassroots organizations aiming 
to end gerrymandering, Voters 
Not Politicians and Count MI 
Vote.

The 
political 
practice 
of 

gerrymandering — manipulating 

the boundaries of an electoral 
constituency 
to 
favor 
a 

candidate or party — has been 
a topic of major debate in recent 
months following the election of 
President Donald Trump.

Kevin 
Deegan-Krause, 
a 

professor of political science at 
Wayne State University, said the 
practice does not receive enough 
attention.

“The drawing of lines is 

an incredibly powerful tool, 
and one that I don’t think we 
appreciate enough,” he said.

Deegan-Krause, along with 

University Law Prof. Nancy 
Wang, are hoping to transfer 
the power of redistricting from 
legislators and politicians to 
Michigan citizens.

The 
town 
hall 
started 

out with a short history of 
gerrymandering and how it 
has been used by both major 
parties as a mechanism for 
winning elections and creating 
constituencies in their favor.

Deegan-Kraus 
said 
both 

Michigan and Maryland are 
guilty 
of 
gerrymandering, 

despite 
their 
difference 
in 

partisan leanings.

“If you are a Republican in 

Michigan or a Democrat in 
Maryland, you could look at the 
map and say, I care deeply about 
what my party wants,” he said. 
“My partner wants what is good 
for the country. My challenge is 
that is there any other reason 
that besides pure partisanship 
that you should be against this.”

The day after the presidential 

election, 
Wang 
joined 
the 

Facebook page for Count MI Vote 
and created a ballot question

The road to the Final 

Four is made in Michigan, 

as both the men’s and 

women’s playing surfaces 

have been built in the 

small town of Amasa, 

Mich. since 2005.

A company named 

Connor Sports, which has 

been in business since 

1872, manufactures the 

playing surfaces, with 

all the wood coming 

from Michigan’s Upper 

Peninsula, MLive 

reported.

After the courts are 

used in the championship, 

the playing surface is 

usually purchased by 

the winning school to 

be installed or used to 

fundraise, according to 

MLive.

The company 

produces 12 courts every 

year for the tournament, 

including the Final Four 

playing surface, Gary 

Gray, Connor Sports 

portable sales manager, 

said.

“We’re a proud 

partner of the NCAA 

and proud to be the 

official court for March 

Madness,” Gray said. “We 

get to see our labor of love 

out on television sets all 

across the nation.”

In any case, 

Michiganders can take 

pride that, even if the 

Wolverines don’t make 

it, the state will still be 

represented in this year’s 

final.

COLOR PL AY

“Hush,” 
the 
10th 
Annual 

Spring 
Monologue 
Show 

presented by Yoni Ki Baat was 
a 
performance, 
directed 
by 

LSA senior Irene Syriac, aimed 
to challenge stereotypes and 
address cultural taboos faced by 
South Asian women and other 
women of color held. 

“Yoni Ki Baat” means “talks 

of the vagina” in Sanskrit. In 
2003, the South Asian Sisters 
organization in San Francisco, 
inspired 
by 
the 
Vagina 

Monologues, put together the 
first Yoni Ki Baat performance 
as a space for women of color to 
share their stories. Thursday, 
it was put on in Rackham 
Auditiorium. 

Many monologues contained 

stories of queer women of color 
and the often-silent battles they 

face, often bringing the audience 
to their feet. Syriac commented 
on the importance of the event.

“I’m hoping people in the 

audience leave today thinking ‘I 
never thought that way before’ or 
learned something new,” Syriac 
said. “I think that as humans we 
are constantly learning and we 
are constantly having these new 
experiences — it’s good to hear 
someone else’s perspective on it.”

Over 
a 
dozen 
performers 

took 
the 
stage 
to 
address 

numerous topics, including their 
frustrations with social norms, 
understanding love and sexuality 
and coming of age. Most of the 
monologues were written by 
their performers, and took the 
form of rhythmic prose, music, 
poetry and monologues.

The Michigan Daily was asked 

not to record the event.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

freshman 
Maxwell 
Lipari 

commented on the effect the 

show had on him.

“The most important thing 

is hear other people’s stories,” 
Lipari said. “To get another 
perspective, especially for me 
as a white male. I don’t have 
these experiences, and hearing 
these stories can help me try 
to understand other people’s 
problems and try to be able 
to understand where they are 
coming from. That way, I can also 
help others try to understand 
what’s 
going 
on, 
and 
also 

recognize my own privilege.”

The program of the event 

contained a glossary, which 
Syriac said she felt was a 
necessary supplement to the 
performance.

“The 
thing 
about 
social 

justice is that there are a lot of 
terms that not everybody not 
really understands well,” Syriac 
said. “If anyone is here to maybe 
learn something or are not super 
into social justice and they don’t 

know a term, they might learn 
something 
while 
they’re 

here.”

Public 
Policy 
junior 

Chandani Wiersba, president 
the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of Yoni Ki Baat and 
event participant, expressed 
how she felt storytelling is 
critical in changing hearts 
and minds, and mentioned the 
weight it can carry.

“I hear over and over 

from all sorts of people that 
narratives 
are 
the 
most 

powerful way to connect and to 
have empathy,” Wiersba said. 
“I think because there is not a 
space on campus for women of 
color otherwise, we create that 
space to empower them and to 
have their voices heard.”

All proceeds of the event 

were donated to Mai Family 
Services, a community-based 
non-profit organization that 
focuses on addressing the needs 
of the South Asian community 
in Southeast Michigan. The 
organization 
specializes 
in 

domestic violence and mental 
health issues.

they wrote.

The three presidents also 

added they agree with Gov.

immigrants add to Michigan’s 
economic strength.

“We agree with Gov. Rick 

Snyder that immigrants have

significantly 
to 
the 

economic 
strength 
of 
our 

state,” the three wrote. “All 
three of our universities can 
better serve society — and 
our economy — because of 
international scholars.”

Schlissel, Simon and Wilson 

ended the editorial by writing 
about the achievements of three 
immigrant 
faculty 
members 

at each of their respective 
institutions, 
including 
UM 

Engineering 
Prof. 
Kamal 

Sarabandi, who is from Iran.

“Known as a leader in radar 

sensing, 
his 
[Sarabandi’s] 

research is used by NASA and

founded companies to market 
some of his technologies.”

activist group, wrote in its 
booklet, “People’s Retort to 
the 
Prosecutor’s 
Report,” 

the death of Aura Rosser and 
the exoneration of the police 
officer responsible is part of a 
national pattern of racism and 
questionable police practices.

“Aura Rosser’s killing and 

the official exoneration of Ried 
is part of a national pattern of 
disregard for Black lives,” the 
booklet reads. “Ann Arbor, one 
of the 10 most economically 
segregated cities of any size in 
the nation, is not exempt from 
racism and patterns of police 
violence. Indeed, Ann Arbor is 
America.”

Though 
Councilmember 

Sumi Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) 
said there is no major progress 
happening 
yet, 
the 
city’s 

Human 
Rights 
Commission 

meeting on March 8 provided a 
glimpse of what may follow in 
the next few months.

In the meeting, Kenneth 

Bouche, 
chief 
operating 

officer 
of 
Hillard 
Heintze, 

stated reform in community 
policing is impossible without 
direct engagement from the 
community.

“In order to move forward, 

in order to enter a new era 
of policing and to solve the 
problems we have seen over 
the last several years, (reform) 
has to be collaborative between 
government, between police 
and between the community,” 
Bouche said at the meeting.

Bouche then expanded on 

how 
the 
proposed 
citizen 

advisory board for the AAPD 
should also be built upon 
collaborative spirit, explaining 
that 
adversarial 
oversight 

boards around the country 
do 
not 
actually 
modify 

police behavior or improve 
community-police relations.

“Whatever you build, it’s not 

going to be adversarial, it’ll be 
cooperative,” Bouche said. “It’s 
designed to be a positive way 
because what we see around 
the 
country 
is, 
adversarial 

oversight only solves some of 

the problems.”

Debra 
Kirby, 
senior 
vice 

president of law enforcement 
counseling at Hillard Heintze, 
explained her team will conduct 
onsite data collection for at 
least one week every month 
and analyze the results offsite. 
Consultants 
will 
conduct 

interviews 
and 
ride-alongs 

with police officers, research 
policies and data, and talk to 
community 
members 
about 

their concerns, holding at least 
one public forum. Kirby said 
her team is aiming to complete 
its report by late June.

“Our goal at this point in 

terms of the assessment is to 
really be objective and let the 
facts show what they show,” 
Kirby said. “We look at what are 
national practices, we listen to 
what this community wants, we 
identify what are the specific 
needs of this community and 
at the end of this assessment 
phase, we’ll come in with 
recommendations 
for 
the 

people 
here 
to 
determine, 

assess, evaluate whether we’ll 
take this forward.”

When 
asked 
whether 

Hillard Heintze plans to do 
what is “right” as opposed 
to what the majority of the 
community 
wants, 
Bouche 

responded what his team is 
looking for is constitutionally 
correct policing that takes into 
account what every subset of 
the entire community — be it 
marginalized, rich, immigrant 
or undocumented — wants from 
the police.

“When we say that the 

community 
should 
direct 

how the police polices its 
community, it doesn’t mean 
the majority should direct how 
everyone is policed,” Bouche 
said. “When we say community, 
we don’t mean majority, but an 
inclusive community.”

Libby 
Hunter, 
a 

representative 
of 
Radical 

Washtenaw who was present 
at the meeting, wrote she 
was pleased to see real steps 
toward the improvement of 
community-police relations. 

“I was surprised because 

they spoke quite powerfully 
about how the (Human Rights 

Commission) was going to have 
to really get involved, and how 
community involvement was 
crucial to their process,” Hunter 
wrote. “They repeated multiple 
times, in different words, how 
community involvement was 
key. You could see the facial 

expressions 
change 
on 
the 

faces of the HRC as they began 
to understand that these people 
meant business.”

HRC Chair Leslie Stambaugh 

said consultants from Hillard 
Heintze also engaged with the 
city’s leadership, the AAPD 
— including Police Chief Jim 
Baird — and the court system 
from March 7 to 9. Baird wrote 
a memo last June describing his 
opinion that a civilian advisory 
board was unnecessary.

Baird 
said 
he 
was 
also 

impressed 
with 
Hillard 

Heintze’s 
attitude. 
Baird 

maintained 
that 
he 
still 

views the advisory board as 
unnecessary, 
but 
reiterated 

he would support such a plan 
if it were recommended from 

Hillard Heintze.

“(Hillard 
Heintze) 
will 

be well positioned to make a 
recommendation on what type 
of community board would 
work well in Ann Arbor,” Baird 
wrote in an email interview. “I 
have met with team members 
from 
Hillard 
Heintze 
and 

believe that their assessment 
and 
experience 
will 
be 

instrumental in designing and 
implementing such a board.”

Though the creation of a 

civilian advisory board will 
most likely pass a council vote, 
its role may be limited, because 
the board’s recommendations 
will 
be 
non-binding. 
Only 

City Council and the City 
Administrator have oversight 
power, per the city’s charter.

Public 
Health 
student 

Vikrant Garg, a representative 
for Students4Justice, a group 
fighting racism on campus, 
criticized what he saw as a 
minimal role for an institution 
with great potential. He argued 
this was a classic case of those 
in power being unwilling to 
give the people actual decision-
making power.

“I think we need to reimagine 

governmental structures that 
can be held to account in a 
system 
that 
currently 
fails 

marginalized folks, especially 
black trans women,” Garg wrote 
in an email interview. “The 
problem is when institutional 
accountability 
measures 
are 

just 
advisory 
existences, 

rather than those with actual 
perceived power.”

However, 
Councilmember 

Chip Smith (D–Ward 5) stated 
in a previous article Hillard 
Heintze is looking for a way 
for the advisory board and City 
Council to work alongside each 
other.

“Ultimately 
as 
a 
council 

person, I look for a board like 
that to give me advice on actions 
to take,” Smith said. “You know 
if there are complaints about an 
action or an officer, certainly I 
want to know what Chief Baird 
says about it, but I also want the 
independent group to be able to 
provide me their interpretation 
of what happened and how to 
best proceed.”

committee to begin drafting 
policy for a ballot proposal. 
Wang has traveled throughout 
the state, gathering feedback 
from communities before the 
petition is released.

“We’ve reached out to all of 

our state representatives and 
all mayors of any population 
greater than 3,000,” Wang 
said. 
“We’re 
really 
trying 

to 
make 
this 
bipartisan, 

nonpartisan and as inclusive 
as we can.”

Deegan-Kraus 
said 

opposing gerrymandering is 
simple and involves a basic 
level of fairness, and some of 
the current boundaries are 
lacking manageability, making 
it difficult for legislators to be 
responsive to their voters.

Other states have passed 

similar proposals that transfer 
the 
redistricting 
authority 

to 
the 
voters, 
including 

California, Arizona and Iowa.

In 2008, California voted 

to pass Proposition 11, which 
created 
a 
redistricting 

commission 
composed 
of 

fourteen 
members 
— 
five 

Democrats, five Republicans 
and 
four 
unaffiliated 

members.

Still, Wang, Deegan-Kraus 

and other members of Voters 
Not Politicians and Count MI 
Vote have not yet drafted a 
policy for the ballot proposal 
for a redistricting commission. 
The policy team is considering 
drafting a policy similar to 
that of California, yet there is 
one major barrier.

Wang 
said 
while 
in 

California voters are registered 
as Democrat, Republican or 
Independent, in Michigan it is 
optional for voters to register 
with a political party. There 
would be no way to ensure that 
restructuring 
commission 

members are indeed from the 
political party they claim, 
which is why Wang and 
Deegan-Kraus 
are 
seeking 

residents’ input to create a 
system for structuring these 
committees.

There are a few reasons 

why voters should care about 
gerrymandering, 
Deegan-

Kraus 
said. 
Among 
those 

are 
that 
gerrymandering 

can 
allow 
incumbents 
to 

retain office with lower vote 
counts, and it often breaks up 
communities.

If 
the 
authority 
of 

redistricting 
switches 
to 

Michigan 
residents, 
the 

possibility exists that voter 
turnout 
will 
increase. 

Wang 
said 
following 
the 

establishment of California’s 
redistricting commission in 
2008, there was an increase in 
voter turnout.

Social 
Work 
student 

Katherine 
Hammond 
said 

in recent months, following 
the election, there have been 
a number of issues to be 
concerned about and to fight 
for. But for Hammond, fighting 
to end gerrymandering is an 
issue that is worth the fight.

“Gerrymandering 

determines who is in power,” 
Hammond said. “To me, that 
gets to some of the root causes 
of why we have so many issues 
and why they are so highly 
contested.”

During the Q&A portion 

following the presentation, 
audience 
members 
voiced 

opinions on how to go about 
creating 
guidelines 
for 

restructuring 
committees. 

Some 
members 
suggested 

creating 
an 
algorithm 
to 

ensure the selection process 
is fair and unbiased, but 
also to have experts, like 
academics 
with 
political 

science backgrounds, serve as 
advisors.

Hammond, 
though 

concerned said he was these 
committees would be elitist.

“I think demographics and 

geography should be a factor 
in who gets picked, as well 
as 
socioeconomic 
status,” 

Hammond said. “I think there 
should be bipartisan support 
and independence.”

There will be two virtual 

town halls for those interested 
in learning more about the 
future proposal. Once the 
petition is drafted, it will need 
316,000 signatures to get on 
the ballot in November.

held strong. Despite two fouls to 
both senior wing Zak Irvin and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 

DJ Wilson, the duo held Pac-12 
Player of the Year Dillon Brooks to 
just four points on 2-of-6 shooting 
in the first half. Brooks ended the 
game with 15 points. 

“We knew he was a downhill 

driver, so I just tried to keep my 
body between him and the rim,” 
Wilson said. “I tried to make as 
many looks as possible tough for 
him.”

Oregon, 
though, 
didn’t 

back down with its star player 
struggling to score, as guard Tyler 
Dorsey filled the void. Dorsey, 
who had averaged 23.6 points a 

game in his last five contests, got 
hot late, finishing the first half 
with a game-high 12 points on 
4-of-8 shooting, including 3-of-4 
from behind the arc to lead the 
Ducks into the halftime break 
with a two-point lead.

The first four minutes showed 

some promise for the offensive 
fireworks many expected, as the 
two teams combined for 21 points 
before the first media timeout.

But the offensive spurt was just 

that — a short burst of energy — 
and the two teams went back to 
struggling to find the basket.

While Oregon led for most of 

the half, back-to-back 3-pointers 
by Wilson and Walton gave the 
Wolverines a rare one-point lead 
with 4:15 remaining in the game.

Afterward, the two teams 

traded baskets — and the lead — 
until Michigan got a defensive 

stop, and Walton hit a jumper 
at the other end to give the 
Wolverines the lead with just over 
two minutes left in the game.

“We all felt confident down the 

stretch,” Robinson said. “Credit to 
them, they made plays, and that’s 
what it takes to win a game with 
two good teams.”

But Oregon roared back and, 

in the span of less than a minute, 
took back the lead.

Then it came down to the last 

shot, Walton’s jumper that fell just 
short.

It wasn’t the ending the 

Wolverines’ 
seniors 
wanted 

— that would’ve happened in 
Phoenix next weekend — but it 
was about as close to it as they 
could get.

And for Beilein and his team, 

that’s about all they ever could 
have hoped for.

Eastman 
pointed 
to 
the 

current political climate in the 
United States and the fear in the 
future of LGBTQ rights under 
the current administration as 
the motivation for the event, as 
well as its importance.

“Right now, LGBTQ rights 

are at stake,” Eastman said. 
“We wanted to make sure 
that people had a safe space to 
express how harmful stories

Bernas, who was encouraged 

to join College Democrats by a 
friend, felt the need to run for 
the co-chair position based on 
her own experience of coming 
out, and expressed how she 
felt personally compelled to 
lead, even though she doesn’t 
identify 
as 
a 
natural-born 

leader.

“This is important work I 

need to be doing,” said Bernas. 
“My sexuality was very new 
to me and even coming to the 
University and accepting it had 

been very new and I had just 
come out at the end of senior 
year and felt that was the time 
for me to really start working 
towards changing policy and 
doing something tangible.”

LSA senior Lauren Harsh 

shared 
her 
own 
personal 

coming out story of when 
realized she was lesbian after 
attending a summer camp 
at the Methodist church she 
attended as a child in the 
months leading up to leaving 
for college. 

Harsh went on to describe 

some of the mixed reactions 
she 
received 
from 
various 

groups of people she had in her 

life.

“When I was at the camp, 

I was really scared,” Harsh 
said. “It’s church camp, and 
the staff members starting 
a relationship together was 
frowned upon anyway, and 
that made me kind of distance 
myself from my friends, which 
I really hated that I felt like I 
had to do that.” 

After, she described the 

immediate sense of belonging 
she felt when she arrived at the 
University in the fall.

“Once I drove up here to 

college, 
I 
dove 
head-first 

into all the gay shit,” Harsh 
said.“I’m out and proud now, 
but that doesn’t mean my story 
is over.”

Art 
& 
Design 
freshman 

Kevin 
Moore 
shared 
his 

personal experience of coming 
out as bisexual in a hyper-
masculine environment on the 
west side of Detroit. In sharing 
his experience, he emphasized 
how coming out is a constant 
experience 
people 
in 
the 

community have to face, if they 
choose to.

“The thing about coming out 

is that it’ll never be a one-time 
thing,” Moore said. “You’re 
going to constantly come out 
to people that you are sharing 

a piece of you to someone, if 
you want to approach someone 
in that way. You do not have to 
approach people saying, ‘I am 
this way,’ because guess what, 
your sexuality is not your 
personality.” 

He went on to offer some 

positive thoughts behind the 
idea of sexuality.

“The best thing about your 

sexuality is that it’s yours,” 
Moore said.

One of the most compelling 

stories of the night was told 
unscripted by a local high 
school 
senior 
attending 

Plymouth Canton Educational 
Park who shared a somber, 

yet insightful, story about 
the details of coming out 
first as bisexual and later as 
transgender.

El Hanley, who identifies 

as 
a 
transgender 
female, 

shared that, even though her 
experience of coming out as 
bisexual in middle school was 
met with overwhelming joy by 
her family, her experience of 
coming out as transgender in 
high school was the opposite.

“Coming out as trans is the 

most complicated thing on the 
planet,” Hanley said.

She 
expressed 
the 

fundamental 
difference 

between 
coming 
out 
as 

bisexual and trans, stating that 
coming out as bisexual or gay 
is more of an option, because 
they relate to a matter of who 
someone 
is 
interested 
in, 

where as coming out as trans 
is matter of physically visible 
changes.

In a more comical sense, 

she referenced the specific 
differences 
in 
interactions 

she shared after both of her 
experiences of coming out.

“When 
I 
came 
out 
as 

bisexual, a lot of people asked 
me if I wanted to have a three-
way, and I got on with my life,” 
Hanley said.

L

ast week, I was walking 
to class when I scrolled 
past a picture of Hillary 

Clinton on Twitter. I suddenly 
remembered 
the 
period 
of 

hopefulness 
and 

confidence 
before 

the 
election 
that 

was 
so 
prevalent 

among 
my 
peers 

and on social media. 
The realization of 
how different things 
would be had she 
won the election hit 
me hard, and I was 
struck by the intense difference 
in pervading mood between 
then and now. 

Hopefulness 
tainted 
my 

every move, from my posts on 
Facebook to my interactions 
with students and discussions 
with friends. I was naively 
optimistic, making jokes about 
what life would be like in Donald 
Trump’s America. Got a C on an 
exam? Hey, it could be worse, we 
could have a divisive reality star 
in charge of the nuclear codes! 
And so on, and so forth.

Before 
the 
election, 

individual political 
concerns 

were purely personal, while 
after the election, many feel 
they have a moral obligation 
to speak or act politically. It 
certainly 
seems 
as 
though 

moral and personal priorities 
have shifted significantly since 
the new administration was 
inaugurated. Yet, how have fear 
and hope influenced the mood 
and emotions we experience 
now? How do we move forward 
using what little power we 
have to influence politics in the 
future and make change?

Interestingly, 
hope 
and 

fear were tied deeply into 
both campaigns of the most 
recent political season. Hillary 
undoubtedly played off the 
fear of Trump, and many who 
voted for her voted not out of 
hope for the change she would 
bring, but rather out of the fear 
of a Trump presidency.

After 
the 
election, 
an 

informal 
campaign 
began 

reminding people to keep in 
mind that this presidency is not 
normal. Many predicted that, 
as time went on, the bigotry 
and hate expressed by Trump 

would begin to feel like familiar 
rhetoric. The importance of 
remaining vigilant was stressed. 
It seems that the hatefulness 

of his rhetoric and 
policy has not been 
lost yet on people, 
and he’s not become 
a normal politician in 
their eyes.

Many 
have 

accepted that Trump 
is the president, as 
painful as it may 
be for some to say 
aloud. But instead of 
letting their guard 

down 
and 
relaxing, 
many 

have remained skeptical and 
vigilant. Fear is not a great 
motivator to act, though it does 
inspire values of personal safety 
and protection, of watchfulness 
and wariness.

Instead of accommodating 

their identities to his presidency, 
many have accommodated his 
presidency to their identities. 
Many 
identify 
themselves 

through 
his 
presidency, 

voluntarily or not. Instead of 
preparing themselves for the 
chaos of the next four years by 
ignoring the news and avoiding 
politics, they’ve chosen instead 
to 
hold 
the 
administration 

accountable, to remind each 
other that this is not normal.

It was widely discussed at the 

time of the election that Trump’s 
successful campaign ran on fear 
alone. The campaign fed off 
the worries and qualms of the 
people who felt themselves to 
be disenfranchised, forgotten. 
Yet I don’t believe their fear 
took them to their polling place 
last November; I believe it was 
their hope. They hoped for a 
country in which they felt they 
could prosper, and Trump’s 
campaign 
slogan, 
“Make 

America Great Again,” was 
appealingly hopeful.

Hope, unlike fear, motivates 

people greatly. In 2008, the 
“Hope” poster came to be 
a 
major 
aspect 
of 
former 

President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

campaign, 
which 
was 

ultimately 
successful. 
Since 

the 2016 election, new social 
justice student groups, like 
Progressives at University of 
Michigan, have popped up 
on campus, and others, like 
Students4Justice, have become 
more 
active. 
These 
groups 

seek to inspire and encourage 
greater 
individual 
political 

change. While for many the 
Trump presidency is far less 
than ideal, the sense of hope 
for change has not disappeared 
entirely. Fear may drive many to 
hold Trump accountable for his 
actions during his presidency, 
but hope will elect the future 
leaders of our country. If there’s 
anything we learned from this 
election, it’s of the slow and 
steady power of hope to lift a 
campaign and push individuals 
into positions of power.

If this tactic is recognized 

and utilized, the outcome of the 
next few elections will reflect 
this. The recent Women’s March 
(on Washington and around the 
globe) empirically exemplifies 
the power of collective hope. Yet 
hope doesn’t have to take its form 
in the gathering of hundreds of 
thousands of protesters. Hope 
can 
also 
be 
individualistic, 

familial, a partnership; hope 
takes infinitely many forms.

As clichéd and outdated as 

the hope and fear dichotomy 
may be, it is nonetheless evident 
that these themes permeate 
U.S. politics. Hopefulness in 
the wake of fear may seem 
unlikely, but while fear spreads, 
hope grows. Strip yourself of 
cynicism, but remain vigilant. 
Be hopeful, but take care not 
to cross into naivety. When left 
unchecked 
and 
unbalanced, 

fear controls. Yet, when fear 
is controlled, the passion and 
energy inspired by it can be 
channeled 
into 
something 

productive. Hope and fear may 
walk along different paths, but 
that’s not to say they can’t work 
in tandem.

“Y

ou can’t put sleep on 
a resume.”

I had a visceral, 

almost dejected, reaction to this 
statement by a student because it 
keenly nailed why a majority of 
University of Michigan students 
don’t 
prioritize 
sleep. 
As 
a 

health educator with Wolverine 
Wellness at University Health 
Service, I am often asked to talk 
about sleep and well-being in 
the college environment. I love 
talking about sleep. And what I’m 
finding out is that students love 
talking about it, too.

Why?
For one, it’s an area of student 

well-being that tends to be less 
controversial than some of the 
other topics we frequently discuss 
with college students, including 
substance use, body image and 
sexual health. Sleep is a more 
benign topic, generally. However, 
sleep is not completely absent of 
stigma, as some may view those 
who nap as lazy or less motivated.

In 
my 
experience, 
most 

students love to sleep. Most 
students want to sleep more, 
and 
they 
understand 
the 

downfalls of lack of sleep. 
When I ask students about 
the negative consequences of 
sleep 
deprivation, 
they 
can 

easily rattle off the following: 
moodiness, 
headaches, 

increased anxiety, drowsiness 
and decreased focus to even 
more concerning complications, 
like heart palpitations, lowered 
immune response and overuse 
of stimulants.

One morning, I had a student 

in my office comment, “Sleep 
deprivation is an affirmation 
of busyness.” This makes sense 
in a competitive culture where 
“busy” is often worn as a badge 
of honor. Somehow busyness 
and 
sleep 
deprivation 
have 

become untenably entangled 
with success.

Students often say there’s just 

not enough time to sleep. They 
relay feelings of guilt — sometimes 
self-inflicted, sometimes cultural 
— when tempted to sleep more, 
figuring they could be using 
their time “better” by working 
harder, doing more, being more. 
And what is the unanticipated 
cost? According to 2016 National 
College 
Health 
Assessment 

data, 73 percent of University of 
Michigan students (75 percent 
of undergraduate students, 68 
percent of graduate students) did 
not sleep enough to feel rested for 
more than five days per week.

I believe this is an unintended 

consequence of the “Leaders and 
the Best” mentality. And I wonder 
if we can start to challenge it a 
bit. What if students could find 
a way to integrate sleep a little 
bit more as part of their overall 
well-being, in varying ways? 
What if there is a way to have it 
all, instead of the myth that you 
have to pick two: academics, 
social life or sleep? Sleep is 
connected to so many other 
dimensions of well-being, and a 
slight positive shift in one area 
can have a direct effect on other 
areas. For starters, improving 

the quality and quantity of sleep, 
and discouraging the use of sleep 
medication, is an effective, simple 
and cheap method of raising 
health and well-being.

One way to increase sleep 

for chronically sleep-deprived 
individuals is a nap. A short 
nap (think power nap!) has the 
potential to increase energy, 
alertness and improve mental 
performance. One study showed 
that a six-minute nap increased 
memorization by 11 percent! 

Yet, it’s not that simple. Some of 

the barriers to napping are being 
away from a bed most of the day, 
accidentally turning a power nap 
into a three-hour sleep session 
and 
concerns 
that 
napping 

may signal laziness. Increasing 
students’ sleep and restfulness 
in practical ways is a complex 
problem, and I invite us all to 
dialogue more about it. While it 
may seem that students can’t put 
sleep on a resume, perhaps well-
being is reflected on one’s resume 
more than we think. How can 
students prioritize sleep so that 
they can be more productive and 
well overall?

How can we begin to shift 

the culture of well-being at the 
University? Let’s start with sleep. 
Check out the University Health 
Service sleep page for more 
tips and techniques to improve 
sleep, and to take an online sleep 
assessment to learn more about 
your sleep personality profile.

campaign

to 
know 
that 
this 

campus has a problem 
when 
it 
comes 
to 

empathizing 
with 

students of color. Both 
deliberately 
and 
unknowingly 

pushing marginalized students 
further into the periphery is a 
theme that runs deep among the 
University of Michigan’s cautious 
administration and 65 percent 
white population. It was therefore 
not surprising when this theme 
manifested itself more recently 
in an unlikely place: a collegiate 
meme page. 

I was lucky (or maybe unlucky) 

enough to witness the chaos 
firsthand. Some context: Last 
month, I received a message from 
my friend, who had created a page 
called “UMich Memes for Edgy 
Teens” (inspired by the smash-
hit, “UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy 
Teens”). He asked me to moderate 
it and, reluctantly, I agreed.

The content started slow — a 

Diag squirrel meme here, a post 
about Canvas there. Students 
poked fun at Greek life, dining hall 
food and their own binge-drinking 
habits. For a week or so, it was 
a tight-knit community of close 
friends and acquaintances bonding 
over shared experiences. It served 
primarily as a place to laugh, vent 
and seek validation from peers.

Then it started to pick up. Soon, 

I was receiving requests to join 
every five minutes, and I even 
noticed students browsing the 
page in lecture and tagging each 
other in posts. The content was 
evolving as well, from broad and 
simple to niche and creative. My 
friend had seemingly developed 
quite the phenomenon, and the 
group was on a trajectory to 
grow exponentially — until out 
of nowhere, just weeks after its 
inception, the page crashed and 
burned with greater intensity 
than it began.

The conflict arose when some 

members began posting memes 
about 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel — some of which 

appropriated African 
American Vernacular 
English 
— 
that 

glorified him in a 
way that made me a 
little uneasy. While 
there did not appear 
to be any malicious 
intent, 
students 
of 

color on the page were 
uncomfortable 
with 

their fellow students 
jokingly 
praising 

someone they felt had failed to 
advocate on their behalf time 
and time again. It appeared as 
though their concerns were being 
trivialized. The tension reached 
a breaking point when those 
students spoke up about their 
frustration in a post and were met 
with resistance — specifically, over 
100 comments of resistance.

Frankly, it was cringe-worthy 

and alarming to watch people 
who were supposedly just there to 
have fun get so worked up when 
confronted with the possibility 
that their definition of fun was 
exclusive and even offensive. Even 
the more nuanced and sensitive 
arguments 
of 
the 
opposition 

seemed to admonish people they 
felt were ruining the lighthearted 
nature of the page.

As students continued to make 

exasperated pleas for the memes 
to stop, some members were quick 
to comply (one tried to divert the 
attention to another University 
icon: the Cube), while others 
were not so willing to bury the 
hatchet. Meanwhile, moderators 
(myself included) were in a frenzy, 
debating whether or not to archive 
the page in a private group chat. 
We worried that there were only 
a few of us and too many members 
to moderate properly. After all, we 
weren’t really edgy teens; we were 
sensitive adults, at best.

The group folded in on itself 

because most of the members 
who clashed with students of 
color on the page did not seem to 
grasp the notion that they were 
actively contributing to a system 
of oppression that reaches so 
far beyond the realm of comedy. 
What they did not understand 
is, in cases such as this, the “fun” 

we are having is at the expense 
of marginalized groups, and it is 
rooted in our ability to poke fun at 
things that they understandably 
cannot dissociate from enough to 
find humorous.

To some, a meme glorifying 

the president of the University 
may have been hilarious, but to 
others, it is a reminder of their 
constant struggle to be heard by 
an administration that doesn’t 
always prioritize their safety and 
inclusion. The conflict on the page 
could be chalked up to people 
refusing to sacrifice their sense 
of humor for other people’s well-
beings — the conflict on campus 
more broadly can be chalked up to 
people refusing to inconvenience 
themselves for the sake of helping 
people of color feel comfortable 
and secure at their own school.

Eventually, 
the 
mod 
team 

decided to delete the group 
following the conflict. From the 
page came two main offshoots: 
“UMich 
Memes 
For 
Edgy 

Teens 
who 
are 
ACTUALLY 

Edgy” (a group that claims in its 
description that it is “not a safe 
space”) and “Now THAT’S What 
I Call ‘Edgy Memes for UMich 
Teens’ VOLUME 2.” The former 
continues to post Schlissel memes, 
while the latter has banned them.

Obviously, 
something 
as 

trivial as a meme page doesn’t 
really matter in the big picture. 
However, the more I analyze the 
situation, the more I realize that 
the implosion of “UMich Memes 
for Edgy Teens” is representative 
of students more broadly brushing 
off the very real concerns raised 
by people of color because they 
“ruin the fun” or “take things 
too seriously.” When you don’t 
suffer at the hands of pervasive 
systems of oppression every day, 
of course you find it easier to 
turn those systems or symbols 
of those systems into something 
humorous. It’s easy to separate 
yourself from that thing, to laugh at 
it. However, not everyone has that 
luxury. To listen and empathize 
with those who may feel excluded 
or offended by your humor is not a 
buzzkill: It’s just a decent thing to 
do. Go back to posting about Diag 
squirrels, please.

No, I’m not talking about the 

Buffybot (BuffyBot? Buffy-bot?). 
I’m talking about the mega-campy 
1992 movie “Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer” that predated the hit TV 
show.

This 
month 
marks 
the 

twentieth anniversary of Joss 
Whedon’s groundbreaking teen 
drama — 20 years of stakes and 
butterfly clips and refreshingly 
enlightened portrayals of teen 
and young adult life. But before 
Sarah Michelle Gellar breathed 
life into the chosen one, Buffy was 
a cheerleader from L.A. played by 
Kristy Swanson.

The film — for which Joss 

Whedon is also responsible — is 
pure camp, a visually stylized 
horror 
comedy. 
It’s 
hard 
to 

compare the movie to the TV show, 
but looking at this movie as source 
material helps make sense of what 
made “Buffy” the TV series stand 
out from other teen dramas.

Little details stick out — Pike 

became Spike, Seth Green has a 

don’t-blink-or-you’ll-miss-it 
role 

as a vampire — that tie the two 
together. The film serves, in its 
own way, as the backstory the 
show never gives us, of Buffy’s 
discovering her slayerdom as a 
shallow, popular girl in L.A.

The movie also points out why 

the story excels on television. It 
lacks the depth of character or 
story that “Buffy” the TV show 
so benefitted from. Over 144 
episodes, we saw Buffy struggle 
and falter in ways that only 
solidified her status as a hero. The 
format of the TV show gives Buffy 
room to move around inside her 
character, something that makes 
her all the more real and all the 
more compelling. It’s important to 
see a heroine — especially one on 
a show targeting young people — 
make mistakes and feel real pain.

On the small screen, “Buffy” 

upended the expectations for TV 
storytelling. Recently, IndieWire 
compiled a list of the best “concept” 
episodes of all time, and, to no 

surprise, “Buffy” was among the 
most referenced shows. The three 
standout episodes “Hush,” “The 
Body” and, my personal favorite, 
“Once Again With Feeling” share 
something beyond their status 
as “concept” episodes. They can 
stand alone. As episodes, they can 
be plucked from the show’s seven 
season long arc and hold their 
own.

The 
show’s 
first 
season 

does this same sort of thing 
to noticeably weaker effect — 
focusing on individual episodes as 
contained stories (find a monster, 
kill a monster, end episode). But 

in the later seasons these concept 
episodes not only play with what 
we expect from TV, but also blur 
— way before Netflix — the line 
between television and the movies.

That’s how the assertion that 

Buffy has to be a TV show gets 
more complicated. It does and it 
doesn’t. “The Body” could stand 
alone as a sharp, poignant portrait 
of the specific grief young people 
grieve. Perhaps one of the show’s 
most cinematic episodes, it shows 
Whedon’s directorial chops in a 
way unique from most episodes. 
Really, it could be a movie. Any of 
these so-called concept episodes 
could.

So, yet again “Buffy” straddled 

the line between film and TV.

Good TV is made every day. But 

“Buffy” was good TV — beautiful, 
complicated, smart TV — for teens. 
It was teen TV in a way completely 
unlike “Gossip Girl” or “Riverdale” 
because it didn’t exploit or mock 
— it listened and saw. I’m having 
a hard time thinking of a show 

specifically 
targeted 
at 
that 

demographic that held its audience 
in such high esteem.

That’s why the show’s ending 

works as well as it does. Buffy 
spreading her power to every 
potential slayer — which, if you’re 
me, can be taken to mean every 
girl in the world (heck yeah!) — 
is a powerful celebration of not 
only female capability, but also of 
girlhood itself. It’s recognition that 
to be a woman — but especially to 
be a girl — is its own kind of fight. 
Sometimes, in fact, the hardest 
thing in this world is to live in it. 
And “Buffy” knew that.

While that sort of thing is hard 

(nearly impossible) to find on TV, 
it’s all over teen movies. Especially 
recent genre additions like “The 
Edge of Seventeen” understand the 
everyday tragedies of adolescence 
as well as they do the milestones. 
“Buffy” operated with a type of 
empathy usually reserved for the 
big screen.

So even if narratively they 

couldn’t really be movies (and 
as Netflix makes this piece less 
and less relevant by the minute, 
blurring the lines between the 
two mediums), they felt like them. 
The way an episode of “Mad Men” 
does.

The supernatural helps make 

sense of the inexplicable. Boys, bras 
and biology homework are easily 
compartmentalized in a world of 
vampires and demons. That’s why 
so many teen TV shows, like “The 
Vampire Diaries” or “Teen Wolf,” 
lean on it. What Buffy did, though, 
was marry the successes of both, 
the supernatural teen show and 
the rich, emotional teen movie.

One isn’t better than the 

other — that’s not the point. But, 
together they demonstrate the two 
ways teen media can excel. One as 
a richly realistic TV show and the 
other as an unabashedly kitschy 
horror comedy.

Buffy saved the world a lot. And 

“Buffy,” both “Buffy”s, saved TV a 
whole hell of a lot.

20 years after cult classic, 
sequel ‘T2’ finally arrives

SONY PICTURES

Twenty 
years 
ago, 
long 

before the zombies or the 
Oscar, director Danny Boyle’s 
sophomore film — a dark 
comedy about heroin junkies 
called “Trainspotting” — was 
blowing up. An instant success 
and undeniable cult classic, 
the film launched the careers 
of numerous actors and shifted 
the course of popular culture.

Two decades later, Boyle 

is 
diving 
back 
in 
to 
the 

world of his 1996 hit for “T2 
Trainspotting,” which picks 
up with Renton, the original’s 
protagonist of sorts, 20 years 
after his betrayal and follows 
his attempt at reentry into the 
world he left behind.

This 
isn’t, 
however, 
the 

first time the idea for a sequel 
has been pursued, but Boyle 
wanted to make sure he didn’t 
revisit the film until the time 
was right. Because, of course, 
there’s nothing worse than a 
bad sequel to a great film.

“If you’re going to update it 

you’ve got to have a reason,” 
Boyle said in a conference call 
with the Michigan Daily. “And 
it didn’t feel like there was a 
reason.”

The first attempt at a sequel 

was abandoned approximately 
10 years ago, before the script 
even made it to the actors. Two 
years ago, on the cusp of the 
twentieth anniversary, Boyle, 
screenwriter 
John 
Hodge, 

source book author Irvine 
Welsh and their production 
team reunited in the hopes of 
pursuing a sequel once again.

“And what emerged was 

much more personal and gave 
us a reason to make the film 
really,” Boyle said. “I think, 
is that it becomes not just a 
sequel, it is obviously a sequel, 
you can’t deny that, but it has 
its own right to exist … raison 
d’être”

Much of that reason is owed 

to time. The entire core cast is 
set to return in the sequel, and 
they’ve aged both physically 
and emotionally since the last 
time they were all together 

— something that was not as 
apparent the last time Boyle 
tried for a sequel.

“Age is cruel, and you don’t 

realize that until you get to 
this point in your life,” said 
Ewen Bremner, who plays Spud 
in both films. “In the first film 
we were full of exuberance and 
potency, and we thought we 
were invincible. And it took us 
20 years to realize that we’re 
just running on the spot and 
time is flying by.”

The opportunity to return 

to a character after this much 
time is one not many actors 
get to experience. The cast 
recognized the rare chance 
“T2” presented.

“To come back together 

and find each other again 
under the same conditions, if 
you like, and with the same 
responsibility for this film 
was just fantastic,” said Ewan 
McGregor, who plays Renton. 
“It just felt like coming home.”

The 
actors 
aren’t 
being 

thrown into exactly the same 
world, however. Now all aged 
46, the group faces a set of 
emotional challenges that both 
stem and diverge from those of 
the first film.

“The other film is obviously 

a great celebration of a certain 
period of your life through 
the most extreme prism you 
can imagine, these junkies in 
Edinburgh,” Boyle said. “Then 
obviously the update is when 
they’re 46 and they’re fucked, 
as Renton says.”

“Trainspotting” became a 

cult success in ways that no 
one involved with the film 
could have imagined. Shot 
in only seven weeks with a 
small budget and a cast of 
relatively unknown actors, the 
film transcended its humble 
origins amassing awards and 
influencing popular culture in 
ways none could have imagined 
20 years ago. 

“We worked really hard on 

it, and we were also all aware 
that we were doing something 
really special and important, 
and so we were giving it our 
all,” McGregor said, reflecting 
on the first film.

Much of that cult status is 

owed to “Trainspotting” ’s 
iconic soundtrack, something 
Boyle and his team wanted 
to recreate in the sequel. 
From Primal Scream to New 
Order, the original soundtrack 
is a celebration of British 
alternative music at a time 
when Britpop groups like the 
Spice Girls were taking over the 
scene. Boyle describes finding 
the first film’s “heartbeat” 
in 
the 
Underworld 
album 

dubnobasswithmyheadman.

“Coming to do the new one 

you want to try and find that 
equivalent 
heartbeat, 
and 

we found this band, Young 
Fathers,” Boyle said.

The band is from the same 

part of Edinburgh as Irvine 
Welsh, which also serves as 
the inspiration for his novels 
“Trainspotting” and “Porno,” 
upon which the films are 
based. Relatively young, Young 
Fathers, were just kids when 
the first film was released.

“And yet their stuff just fits 

in the film,” Boyle said.

In 
addition 
to 
the 

soundtrack, 
“Trainspotting” 

was helped on its way to cult 
stardom by the now-famous 
voiceovers, 
delivered 
by 

McGregor’s character Renton, 
that bookend the film.

“There’s 
that 
confidence 

and that fearlessness which 
permeates the first movie and 
it’s really summed up in the 
voiceover,” said Jonny Lee 
Miller, who plays Sick Boy. 
“Especially in the end speech 
there, this is what I’m going to 
do, this is who I am, this is who 
I’m going to be.”

There’s a certain assuredness 

in that final speech, but it’s 
never 
preachy. 
There’s 
no 

clear lesson or morale to 
“Trainspotting,” 
something 

that the film has been both 
lauded and condemned for. But 
ultimately it was something 
Boyle did intentionally.

“You hope people recognize 

it as honest really,” Boyle said. 
He doesn’t make films with the 
intention of sending a message 
or proving a point. Instead, 
Boyle strives for honesty.

“T2 Trainspotting” opens in 

wide release on March 31.

A Tale of Two Buffys

MUSKET’s ‘Sister Act’ is 
comedy and community

COURTESY OF MUSKET

For 
their 
long-awaited 

Winter 
semester 
musical 

production, the University of 
Michigan’s premier student-
run theatre troupe, MUSKET, 
will be presenting the lively and 
hilarious “Sister Act: A Divine 
Musical Comedy.”

The musical, which is based 

on the 1992 movie starring 
Whoopi Goldberg, follows the 
story of Deloris Van Cartier, 
a wayward woman who, after 
seeing her ex-boyfriend commit 
murder, hides in a convent. 
Coming 
from 
Philadelphia 

with dreams of being a singer 
to ending up in a house full 
of nuns, Van Cartier finds 
herself in an entirely different 
world. She uses her talents, 
however, to teach the other 
nuns choreography and music, 
resulting 
in 
wonderfully 

entertaining, powerful musical 
numbers with convivial spirit.

Playing Deloris Van Cartier 

is Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior 
AnnEliza 
Canning 

Skinner, who has been involved 
in 
SMTD 
productions 
like 

“Caroline, or Change,” “Music 
Man” and “American Idiot.” 
Through 
MUSKET, 
this 
is 

her first ever leading role in a 
musical.

“‘Sister Act’ is actually the 

show that made me want to 
pursue Musical Theatre when 
I was younger,” Skinner said in 
an interview. “It’s so cool to see 
it come full circle like that.”

Completely 
student-run, 

the production includes cast 
and crew from many areas of 
the University. MUSKET is 
made up of about 50 percent 
performance majors and 50 
percent 
non-performance 

majors. Part of MUSKET’s 
mission is to ensure that non-
performance 
majors 
have 

the 
opportunity 
to 
pursue 

their passion for theatre and 
performance.

“Honestly, 
I 
love 
this 

experience so much because 
of the aspect that it’s student-
run,” Skinner said. “My favorite 
part about this show is the 
standard that we hold each 
other to. Even though we’re 
all students, I’ve never seen 
such a hard working cast. The 
dedication, the universality and 
the passion for the theatre is so 
cool to experience.”

With rehearsals starting in 

January, the MUSKET cast and 
crew has been working long and 
hard for the April production. 
Music, Theatre & Dance junior 
Chris Campbell, the show’s 
Director and Choreographer, 
began his work before winter 
break.

“It’s hilarious. It’s nonstop 

laughing 
for 
two 
hours,” 

Campbell said. With this being 
his first time directing and 
choreographing 
a 
MUSKET 

production, 
Campbell’s 

excitement and gratification is 
tangible.

“I think what makes this 

production 
different 
and 

special is the energy that all the 
cast members bring,” he said. 
“There’s such a fresh, youthful 
energy to it.” 

“Sister Act” features music 

by 11-time Grammy winner, 
eight-time Oscar winner and 
Tony 
award 
winner 
Alan 

Menken, who also wrote the 
music for other Broadway hits 
such as “A Christmas Carol” 
and 
“Newsies,” 
along 
with 

classic Disney movies such 
as “Hercules,” “Beauty and 
the 
Beast” 
and 
“Aladdin.” 

“Sister Act” earned five Tony 
nominations.

“I have to say it’s so exciting 

and just so fun. Everyone is so 
supportive and unconditionally 
dedicated 
to 
this 
project,” 

Skinner added. “I struggle a 
lot with acceptance of myself, 
and I feel like this is such a 
great opportunity for students 
to work with other students, 
and especially to have some 
psychological 
freedom 
from 

the pressures that we put on 
ourselves.” 

After months of working on 

intricacies, perfecting details 
and rehearsing little bits and 
pieces of the show at a time, 
when the time to put everything 
together came, it was nothing 
short of magical.

“The highlight of this whole 

process definitely would have 
to be the first time we ran the 
whole show,” Campbell said. 
“It was so exciting for me. 
Everything started to take 
form. 
The 
ending 
product 

exceeded 
my 
expectations 

by 1000 percent: I did not 
think we would have the cast 
that we have, the set that we 
have, the lights that we have, 
the costumes we have, the 
orchestra we have.”

Like MUSKET itself, “Sister 

Act” channels the importance 
of community.

“With 
everything 
that’s 

going on in the world, it’s such a 
great story of sisterhood, unity 
and love,” Skinner said. “I think 
everyone can gain something 
from it.”

When 
I 
wrote 
about 

“American 
Crime” 
at 
the 

beginning of its second season, 
I had no idea where the story 
was going, but I still said there 
were 
no 
other 

shows that tackled 
its 
thematic 

material with as 
much intelligence 
and 
gravity. 
As 

the second season 
progressed, 
that 

continued 
to 
be 

true. The season 
built its characters 
and its story, and 
pulled off some truly shocking 
twists (like the brilliant scene 
at the end of “Episode 7” in 
which 
a 
character 
shoots 

a former classmate at the 
school). There’s nothing to 
suggest that season three will 
do anything differently. It’s 
taking on a new but no less 
compelling set of themes with 
a different group of characters 
and a completely new story. 
The premiere is saddled with 
a significant amount of setup, 
but it seems like the payoff will 
be worth sitting through the 
legwork.

The third season takes place 

in Alamance County, North 
Carolina. It follows a group 
of people who are trying to 
get by, despite their situation. 
In the premiere, Luis (Benito 
Martinez, “House of Cards”) 
crosses the border and moves 
into his work at a farm in 
North Carolina. Meanwhile, 

Issac 
(Richard 
Carbral, 

“Southland”) tries to recruit 
Coy (Connor Jessup, “Falling 
Skies”), a drug-addicted, poor 
man to work at the farm. Also, 
we see the underage Shae (Ana 
Mulvoy-Ten, 
“CSI: 
Cyber”) 

work as a prostitute.

Within these stories are 

powerful 
themes that the 
show looks to 
explore 
with 

deftness 
and 

poise. Not only 
does this season 
talk about illegal 
immigration, 
it 
also 
deals 

with child sex 
trafficking and 

drug addiction. Each one of 
these issues has had its moment 
in 
the 
political 
spotlight 

recently, 
especially 
illegal 

immigration. 
As 
president 

Donald Trump begins to crack 
down on illegal immigration 
in the US, the story the show 
is telling about Luis takes on 
increasing relevance. During 
the premiere, he’s placed at 
a farm for work and is told 
he owes a major debt to the 
people who brought him to 
North Carolina. It’s clear the 
show has something to say on 
these subjects, and I’m looking 
forward to watching the show 
explore these ideas.

“American 
Crime” 
’s 

ensemble remains one of the 
best on television. This season, 
the show brought back many 
of the stars of last season and 
added a couple big stars as well. 
Regina King (“The Leftovers”), 
who won an Emmy for both 

seasons of work, plays a social 
worker who tries to help out 
the kids involved in the sex 
trafficking case. She spends 
a lot of the premiere setting 
up her character, but the role 
is 
ripe 
with 
opportunities 

to grow. Jessup, who was a 
pleasant surprise as Taylor 
last year, is another actor 
with a character with a lot 
of potential. Cherry Jones 
(“24”) and Tim DeKay (“White 
Collar”) are the show’s biggest 
additions, playing a brother 
and sister who are running a 
financially-strapped farm.

My biggest criticism for 

the premiere is that it spends 
so much time setting up the 
characters 
and 
their 
roles 

that it doesn’t clearly lay out 
the arcs for the season. It 
introduces who the people are 
and the role they play in the 
county, but I can’t say where 
the story is going and how 
the show is going to explore 
its themes. “Crime” is using 
world-building 
rather 
than 

story to introduce its season. 
Still, I trust that showrunner 
John Ridley (who won an 
Oscar for “12 Years a Slave”) 
knows what he’s doing and will 
explore this world to its fullest 
potential.

Last year, “American Crime” 

was one of the best shows to 
air on TV. It explored difficult 
material 
with 
grace 
and 

composure. This year appears 
to 
be 
no 
different. 
With 

compelling 
characters 
and 

relevant 
thematic 
material, 

“Crime” looks like it’s going 
to maintain that crown this 
season.

‘Crime’ continues to wow

Rick Ross’s tried & true

MAYBACH MUSIC GROUP

Somewhere 
on 
the 

theoretical 
spectrum 
of 

ridiculousness, 
roughly 

situated 
between 
Pusha 
T 

calling himself the “L. Ron 
Hubbard 
of 
the 

Cupboard” and Lil 
Wayne 
claiming 

that 
“everyday 

Christmas, I’m egg 
nogged out,” lies 
Rick Ross, he of 
ultimate excess.

When it comes 

to 
luxury, 
Rick 

Ross 
isn’t 
merely 
part 
of 

the equation — he makes 
the 
equation, 
each 
boast 

leading 
to 
more 
attention, 

all 
new 
attention 
leading 

to 
an 
exponentially 
more 

extravagant life. For Ross, 
there’s an eternally correct 
answer 
to 
sustaining 
said 

equation: Blow Money Fast.

So let’s talk about his latest 

release, Rather You Than Me, 
which 
is 
sufficiently 
nice. 

There are fireworks, sure. 
They begin with the first track, 
“Apple of My Eye.” Ironically 
enough, the apple of Ross’s eye 
is himself — not his significant 
other, or his child, but himself, 
for doing it big. Especially for 
thinking introspectively about 
doing it big. He stays true to 
himself by shining a light on, 
well, himself. In other words, 
the track is quintessentially 

Rick Ross.

Quintessential 
Rick 
Ross 

also means quintessentially 
phenomenal 
production. 

“Santorini 
Greece” 
works 

thanks 
to 
a 
comfortably-

paced drum, dreamy piano 
and pitched vocal riffs. It 
transports back, all the way 

back, to 2010. 
Rick 
Ross 

ideally needs a 
grand entrance, 
a red carpet of 
sorts, and once 
upon a time, on 
Kanye 
West’s 

“Devil 
in 
a 

New 
Dress,” 

he got just that. After over a 
minute of similarly dreamy 
riffs, in came Rozay. Rozay 
is 
a 
French 
champagne. 

French champagne is rather 
objectively dope. The math 
adds up: He is inherently extra 
in the best possible way, and 
“Santorini Greece” is another 
entertaining embodiment of it.

Maybe 
Ross 
needed 
a 

Chris Rock intro on “Idols 
Become Rivals” and “Powers 
That Be” to prove he doesn’t 
take himself too seriously. 
When he opts for compelling 
substance — if you absolutely 
need that sort of thing from 
him — it comes in the form 
of “Game Ain’t Based On 
Sympathy” and “Scientology.” 
There’s 
gorgeous 
jazzy 

instrumentation in the former 
track.

Even so, it’s undebatable 

that the hits, nay, unapologetic 
bangers, 
have 
been 
the 

lifeblood of Ross’s career; this 
is crucial to acknowledging 
Ross’s accomplishment. He’s a 
visionary because he survives 
and thrives on hits, and it 
works, if only because his hits 
really fucking bang, time and 

time again.

Indeed, 
a 
discography 

highlighted 
by 
bona 
fide 

bangers — years later we bump 
“Hustlin’,” 
“B.M.F.,” 
“Stay 

Schemin’,” “Sanctified” and 
the like — has proven to be 
timeless. The best of Rather 
You Than Me adds to the case.

Three years from now we 

very well could be bumping 
“Trap Trap Trap” (“Only fuck 
if she exclusive / Her favorite 
rapper Lil Boosie / To tell the 
truth I didn’t ask / When it 
come to bitches I’m Gucci”), 
what with its almost reckless 
features 
from 
both 
Young 

Thug and Wale. The single, 
along with the trappy “Dead 
Presidents” and hook-friendly 
“She On My Dick,” certainly 
feels like it has staying power.

Rather You Than Me, as 

an entire album, exists in a 
fantastical world that feels 
fairly exclusive to those other 
than him and his crew. All are 
invited to experience what it’s 
like as long as the guests don’t 
try to rationalize, well, any 
part of it. With this in mind, 
it’s not too difficult to find a 
funny sort of sanctification 
still surrounding Rozay.

Wolverines begin Big Ten play at Maryland

Prior 
to 
the 
season, 
the 

Big Ten’s coaches picked the 
Michigan baseball team to finish 
second in the conference, right 
behind Maryland. But as the 
Wolverines prepare to open Big 
Ten play against the Terrapins, 
rankings are the last thing on 
their minds. 

“Preseason rankings really are 

worthless,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “The only rankings 
that mean anything are the final 
ones. Even the in-season ones 
don’t mean jack squat. We’re not 
going in to prove anything to 
anyone, we’re just going to play 
our butts off.”

While the Wolverines (16-4 

overall) may not be paying 
attention to polls, it’s clear that 
after their hot start, the polls are 
paying attention to them. After 
taking three out of four against 
Northern Illinois last weekend, 
Michigan moved up three spots 
in the D1Baseball.com poll, going 
from 21st to 18th, and currently 
finds itself in the Top 25 in three 
other polls as well.

Regardless of the Wolverines’ 

opinions about rankings, the polls 
still demonstrate the respect that 
Michigan has earned from its early 
triumphs against a challenging 
non-conference schedule.

“We’ve gone toe-to-toe as 

a conference with some of the 
nation’s best and we’ve been 
fortunate to have a lot of early 
success,” Bakich said. “We bring a 
high level of confidence going into 
conference play. We recognize it 
is conference play, but we’re not 
going to change anything, that’s 
for sure.”

Michigan will look to continue 

its 
early-season 
momentum 

against Maryland (13-7), where 
Bakich coached from 2010 to 
2012 before taking the Michigan 
job. While the Terrapins have 
a slightly worse record than 
the Wolverines, their statistical 
profile indicates what should be a 
well-matched series.

Offensively, 
Michigan 
and 

Maryland have put up almost 
identical 
numbers 
– 
the 

Wolverines bat .270 as a team with 

18 home runs and a .792 on-base 
plus slugging percentage (OPS), 
while the Terrapins have a .269 
average, 18 home runs and a .797 
OPS. Both teams also love to run, 
and excel at doing so – both rank 
in the top 10 nationally in steals, 
with 47 and 44, respectively.

The beginning of the home 

schedule saw some lineup changes 
for the Wolverines, most notably 
the ascension of 
senior shortstop 
Michael 
Brdar. 

With 
a 
.325 

average, 
three 

home runs and a 
.907 OPS, he has 
been Michigan’s 
hottest 
hitter 

recently, earning 
a move to third in 
the batting order.

“In 
baseball, 

you try to play the hot hands,” 
Bakich said. “Sometimes you go 
off hunches, and sometimes you 
just go off statistics. He’s been 
hitting in the six-hole most of 
the year and we just felt like we 
wanted him up more often. If 
there’s opportunities to get him 
more at-bats throughout the 
game, we want to do that.”

While 
statistically 
the 

Wolverines lack the individual 
offensive firepower of players 
such as Maryland’s right fielder 
Marty Costes, who is hitting 
.350 with four home runs and 
a 1.027 OPS, there are very few 
weak spots top to bottom in their 
lineup, especially with junior 
first baseman Jake Bivens and 
third baseman Drew Lugbauer 

emerging 
from 

their slumps to 
begin the season.

Bivens 

recently recorded 
multiple 
hits 

in four straight 
games – a streak 
that 
came 
to 

an 
end 
during 

Wednesday’s 
game 
against 

Western 

Michigan 
– 
while 
Lugbauer 

batted .333 with three home runs 
and nine RBIs in the Northern 
Illinois series last weekend.

While Michigan and Maryland 

appear to be even on offense, 
the mound has proven to be a 
different story. The Terrapins 
possesses an earned-run average 
of 4.24, a full run higher than 

the Wolverines. But this isn’t to 
say Maryland lacks shut-down 
potential: Brian Shaffer (2-1) has a 
1.65 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 32.2 
innings, while Tyler Blohm (4-1) 
has kept pace with him by putting 
up a 1.78 ERA. 

However, Michigan’s starting 

rotation this weekend – consisting 
of 
junior 
left-handers 
Oliver 

Jaskie and Michael Hendrickson 
and junior right-hander Ryan 
Nutof – is well-equipped to keep 
pace with Maryland’s hurlers. 
While Jaskie leads the staff 
with a 3-0 record, 2.60 ERA and 
32 strikeouts in 27.2 innings, 
Hendrickson has come on strong 
lately as well, having not allowed 
an earned run in two of his 
previous three starts.

The optimism around the 

Michigan program has been 
palpable all season. And as the 
Wolverines prepare to take on the 
Big Ten, there has been no change 
in their confident attitude.

“We just try to stick with 

our brand of baseball and the 
toughness and grit that we bring 
every day,” said senior catcher 
Harrison Wenson. “We’re just 
going to go in there and win some 
ballgames.”

SOFTBALL
Michigan looks to extend 
dominance vs. Penn State

Timing is vital to extending 

winning streaks when hungry 
competition 
presents 
itself. 

Almost as essential as it is to hit 
the softball. 

After scoring 15 runs in two 

contests against Bowling Green 
and Eastern Michigan this week, 
the Michigan softball team looks 
like it has finally turned a corner 
offensively — just in time for the 
start of Big Ten Play.

This 
weekend, 
the 

19th-ranked Wolverines (19-7-
1) 
will 
ride 

its five-game 
winning 
streak 
as 

they 
open 

conference 
play 
against 

Penn 
State 

(12-14) 
at 

Alumni Field.

Michigan’s 

offensive 
production 
— though down by a run per 
game since last season — is now 
rolling behind the bat of junior 
first baseman Aidan Falk, who 
notched two hits and two RBI 
on 
Wednesday. 
After 
being 

moved to the cleanup spot in an 
ever-changing order, Falk drove 
in five runs in a doubleheader 
against Kent State last Sunday.

“She’s settling into the fact 

that she’s in the four-hole, which 
is a big RBI spot,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins.

Falk and the Wolverines, 

however, will have to contend 
with the augmented frustration 
their opponent carries into this 
weekend, as Michigan has ended 
the Nittany Lions’ season in the 
second round of the Big Ten 
Tournament the last two years.

And that suffering for Penn 

State is even more far-reaching. 
It has lost the last 25 games 
in the series — a streak that 
extends back to 2007. When 
the Wolverines struggled to 
score against ranked teams 

in preseason tournaments, it 
looked as if 2017 might finally 
be the Nittany Lions’ time to 
dethrone the king of the Big Ten.

The Wolverines, though, are 

playing like the team they were 
expected to be at the season’s 
start. Junior right-hander Tera 
Blanco is throwing like the 
pitcher she was supposed to 
be as a highly touted recruit, 
surrendering 
just 
three 

combined runs and notching 12 
strikeouts in this week’s games. 
Most importantly, however, the 
offensive attack has begun to 
return to its form of previous 

seasons. 

Eight runs, 

four 
extra-

base hits and 
homers 
from 

Blanco 
and 

sophomore 
right 
fielder 

Natalie Peters 
on Wednesday 
provided 
a 
marked 

improvement 

over Saturday’s win against Kent 
State, in which the Wolverines 
had to rely on costly errors from 
the opposition to squeak by what 
should have been a far inferior 
opponent.

Hutchins 
credits 
the 

improvement to a combination 
of some players’ extra work and 
an improved sense of timing at 
the plate.

“We’ve been working on our 

swings and working on our 
timing,” Hutchins said. “We saw 
some well-hit balls and hit two 
home runs in two games — that’s 
definitely an improvement.

“We’ve 
had 
some 
kids 

(practicing) extra this week, and 
their desire that’s what a coach 
wants to see.”

Those additional repetitions 

might make Michigan even more 
nightmarish for Penn State this 
weekend, as the Wolverines’ 
confidence 
is 
blooming. 

Michigan will look to continue its 
win streak and hold the Nittany 
Lions to an additional loss.

Wolverines advance to WNIT quarterfinals

This game was always going to 

be memorable. For the first time, 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

coach Kim Barnes Arico faced off 
against her 
old team — 
a team that 
she 
had 

led to 176 wins over 10 years and 
exited as the winningest coach in 
program history. 

The Wolverines hosted St. 

John’s at Crisler Center for the 
first time in Barnes Arico’s tenure, 
and her team did not let her down, 
beating St. John’s, 60-40. 

“I thought it was incredible,” 

Barnes Arico said. “I’ve been 
pretty sick about it for the past few 
days. It’s tough. I think more from 
the outside noises of my family 
wanted to fly in, my uncle coming 
in, seeing some people I haven’t 
seen in a long time. 

“There’s a lot of memories 

there, which stir up a lot of things. 
Very positive memories. St. John’s 
gave me my first opportunity at 
the Division I level so I’m always 
loyal to them.” 

During the contest, senior 

guard Siera Thompson became the 
program leader in games played 
with a total of 138. She finished 
with eight points, three assists and 
two steals. 

The game started off with a 

surprise, however. Instead of 
walking out with the starting five, 
freshman guard Kysre Gondrezick 
missed Thursday’s game and will 
take a leave of absence for personal 
reasons. In her place, senior guard 
Danielle Williams earned the 
start, but Gondrezick’s absence 
was noticeable. The team did not 
comment when she’ll be returning.

The 
Wolverines 
initially 

struggled from the field, shooting 
0-for-7 in the first four minutes 

of gameplay and only managing 
a pair of free throws from junior 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty. 
St. 

John’s, though, managed just five 
points during that timeframe.

The best play of the second 

quarter was a layup by Munger 
with 4:53 left to go. A huddle of 
Red Storm and Wolverines were 
beneath the basket, and, from the 
corner, Munger rushed into the 
paint and stole the ball. The two-
point boost brought Michigan 
within one point, the closest it had 
been all game. Then, Williams 
pushed Michigan over the edge 
with a layup to give the Wolverines 
their first lead.

The first half ended, 30-29, with 

Flaherty making three free throws 
to push her team ahead. 

“I’m kind of mental with my 

free throws,” Flaherty said. “I was 
just hoping I could end the half 
by hitting those three and really 
helping our team get back our 
momentum. So I think that was 
the best part of it.” 

The 
second 
half 
was 
a 

completely 
different 
story. 

Michigan held St. John’s to just 10 
points on 5-for-26 shooting. The 
Wolverines also managed to foul 
out two of the Red Storm’s most 
prominent performers. 

To 
fill 
Gondrezick’s 
place, 

Michigan needed to go deeper 
into the bench, meaning freshman 
guard Kayla Robbins stood out. 
She finished with a game-high 
seven rebounds. 

“I don’t know if it shows up in 

the box score in points,” Barnes 
Arico said. “But she was able to 
draw some key, key fouls on their 
kids, and actually the fifth foul on 
their best player and get them out 
of the game. So sometimes people 
don’t recognize and see that, but 
for us that was critical.” 

Barnes Arico had prepared for 

the game knowing St. John’s kept 
their opponents to around the 

60-point mark — which Michigan 
hit squarely — and this game was 
no different. For a team that hit 
the century mark three times 
in a row at the beginning of the 
season and regularly reaches 80, 
that was an anomaly. 

“We definitely just had to 

execute well and take advantage 
of the shots, because we knew 
we weren’t going to have many,” 
Thome said. “We really just 
had to make sure we had stops 
on defense down on the end, 
because if it’s going to be a low-
scoring game, we can’t have it 
being too close.” 

At the end of the game, Barnes 

Arico still shook the hand of her 
former assistant coach — now St. 
John’s head coach Joe Tartamella. 
And she did so victoriously.

A 
few 
minutes 
before 

the 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team’s third-round 
WNIT 
matchup 
against 
St. 

John’s, reporters received an 
announcement that Wolverine 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, a breakout star 
this year, is taking an indefinite 
leave of absence from the team. 
Gondrezick had been scoring 14.9 
points per game on the season, 
and her absence left a void in the 
team’s offense. 

Michigan 
decided 
to 

compensate by taking the ball 
to the paint almost exclusively 
in the first half, scoring 32 of its 
60 points there by game’s end in 

a 60-40 win.

“At the half, it was good for us 

to keep encouraging the kids,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “They came in like they 
couldn’t get a shot off. We had to 
say, ‘If they’re over there, then 
penetrate the basket or push and 
wear them down.’ ”

St. John’s coach Joe Tartamella 

instructed his players to “stay 
vertical” when his players were 
defending in the paint. With the 
Red Storm keeping their arms 
up and not fouling, Michigan 
struggled scoring in the game’s 
beginning. St. John’s has held its 
opponents to just under 62 points 
per game on the season, giving 
the Wolverines a challenge in the 
scoring column.

Michigan managed just 10 

points in the first quarter, just 
six of which came in the paint, 
and sophomore center Hallie 
Thome went 1-for-4 from the 
field. Without Thome’s post 
presence, the Wolverines had 
difficulty scoring in other areas, 
failing to make one 3-pointer 
while shooting below 20 percent 
from the field. The Red Storm 
led, 13-10.

“I think they’re very aggressive 

and it took me a moment to get 
used to it,” Thome said.

Thome readjusted and got 

to the basket with ease in the 
second quarter, scoring the 
team’s first four points. But 
Michigan’s guards had less 
success against the Red Storm 
interior defense, as St. John’s 
swatted three shots by the 
midpoint of the second quarter. 
Michigan started to gain some 
momentum at the same time 
after sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger rebounded an airball in 
the paint and put it back up to 
cut the deficit to one, 23-22. On 
the next Wolverine possession, 
senior guard Danielle Williams 

made a finger-roll layup while 
driving through the key to give 
Michigan its first lead of the 
game.

By halftime, Michigan had 

20 points in the paint but still 
trailed 30-29. The Wolverines 
didn’t make either of their two 
attempted 3-pointers and scored 
seven from the charity stripe. 
That left just one made jump shot 
as Michigan shot 38 percent for 
the half.

“By the half, I think I only took 

one 3-point attempt,” said junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty. “It was 
definitely different trying to take 
it to the basket.”

The first 3-pointer came in 

the first minute of the second 
half when senior guard Siera 
Thompson nailed one from the 
corner to tie the game at 32. 
Thome ran to the low block on a 
fast break a minute later to give 
Michigan a two-point lead.

The rest of the third quarter 

continued to be a defensive 
struggle as Michigan made only 
one of its last seven shots while 
St. John’s made one of its last nine 
on a four-minute scoring drought. 
The Wolverines led 43-36 going 
into the fourth quarter.

Michigan 
began 
to 
pull 

away in the fourth quarter as 
it had a 12-point lead with just 
6:10 remaining in the contest. 
Flaherty pushed the lead to 15 
with her first triple of the game 
two minutes later to continue 
a 10-0 run for the Wolverines. 
She finished with 18, and Thome 
ended with 19 to help Michigan 
close out the game without 
Gondrezick.

It’s fitting that without their 

third-best scoring option, that 
the 1-2 punch of Flaherty and 
Thome would carry the load 
to lead the Wolverines to the 
WNIT Sweet 16 for the second 
year in a row.

THE END OF THE ROAD

OREGON 69
MICHIGAN 68

For the majority of the season, 
if you were trying to guess who 
would have the ball in their hands 
for the shot, you were better off 
picking a name out of a hat.

First came the game against 

Virginia Tech at Crisler Center. 
The Wolverines surrendered a 
15-point lead to fall, 73-70, to the 
Hokies.

Justin Bibbs converted twice 

from the line with three seconds 
left to give Virginia Tech the 
three-point advantage, but 
Michigan still had a chance.

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-

Rahkman sent the ball toward 
the baseline. Moritz Wagner 
needed to use every inch of his 
6-foot-11 frame to keep the ball 
inbounds, corralling it toward 
Duncan Robinson.

Robinson had no choice 

but to let it fly from deep. 
Waltonwatched from the 
opposite wing as it rimmed out.

In the final five minutes of 

the game, Michigan was 2-for-
9 from the field. That night, 
the Wolverines needed an 
answer down the stretch. It was 
nowhere to be found. 

Against Texas the following 

week, things fell in Michigan’s 
favor. The Wolverines won, 
53-50, but things could have just 
as easily gone the other way.

With 19 seconds left against 

the Longhorns, Michigan trailed 
by one. This time, Zak Irvin took 
the final shot — driving to the 
basket only to watch the ball 
clank off the backboard.

Fortunately for him, Wagner 

was there to clean up the 
garbage. The sophomore big 
man corralled a rebound, and 
kissed the ball off the glass to 
give the Wolverines a one-point 
lead with 16 seconds left. Walton 
was standing at the 3-point line 
watching it happen.

Michigan had a man hit the 

final shot. It didn’t have the man 
hit the final shot.

Then came the trip to Iowa 

City in January. Michigan 
went back and forth with the 
Hawkeyes all game — it was only 
fitting that the matchup went to 
overtime.

Once again, the Wolverines 

dropped one — 86-83 — in 
crunch time at Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena.

With 19 seconds left, Iowa’s 

Peter Jok knocked down two 
from the charity stripe to put 
the Hawkeyes up three. But 
Michigan had the final shot. With 
seven seconds left and a chance 
to tie, DJ Wilson pulled up from 
three. It didn’t even come close, 
and Zak Irvin’s offensive rebound 
was for naught.

Walton was the one who 

passed it to Wilson in the first 
place. John Beilein needed 
someone who could take the 
ball and go get a bucket. He had 
one of his most inexperienced 
starters shooting a deep 3 to tie 
instead.

But somewhere along the line, 

Beilein found his guy in Walton. 
As he said on Feb. 25, after 

Walton led the Wolverines to an 
upset win over Purdue, Beilein 
got the guard “we always wanted 
him to be.”

Walton’s teammates had their 

man to rely on down the stretch, 
too. And in the locker room, after 
Michigan’s season had ended, it 
was clear to see how they found 
him.

“The thing that hurts the most 

is to see these guys down, and 
that’s all that really matters to 
me,” Walton said. “I love these 
guys so much, and I just wish we 
could extend their season.”

Their season. Not my season.
If there were a moment for 

Walton to be selfish, Thursday 
night was it.

After four years, he had played 

the last game of his Michigan 
career.

He had done everything he 

could to make sure it wasn’t, 
too, turning in 20 points — tied 
for a game high — on 6-for-10 
shooting, while adding eight 
assists and five rebounds.

But that’s Derrick Walton Jr.’s 

self-described M.O. — a servant 
leader.

And that’s why — at some 

point this season — everyone 
figured out who they wanted 
with the ball in his hands against 
the Ducks on Thursday night.

It’s not because Walton played 

outside of himself for the final 
six weeks of Michigan’s season.

It’s because he’s type of 

person you trust to keep your 
season alive.

Last possession wins.
As the seconds ticked down in 

the final minutes of Thursday’s 
slugfest between Michigan and 
Oregon, those were the three 
words everyone was thinking.

Every shot, every dribble, 

every pass would count for 
more. As the Wolverines and the 
Ducks exchanged the lead five 
times in the final five minutes, 
all it could take for either team 
to emerge with the win was one 
of something.

Inevitably, Oregon emerged 

with one more than Michigan 
in several categories:

One defensive rebound...
...Oregon 
inevitably 

outrebounded Michigan. The 
Wolverines had worked so hard 
to overcome many defensive 
shortcomings in the second 
half of the season, but the one 
area that proved to be their 
Achilles Heel was the offensive 
glass. 
Michigan 
will 
finish 

ranked 
212th 

out of 351 teams 
in 
offensive 

rebound 
percentage 
on 

defense.

For the game’s 

first 38 minutes, 
the 
Wolverines 

had 
done 
as 

good a job as 
ever, 
limiting 

the 
Ducks’ 

second 
chance 

opportunities. Oregon had just 
four offensive rebounds and 
two 
second-chance 
points. 

Senior wing Zak Irvin and 
redshirt sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson were making aggressive 
moves to ensure they weren’t 
outmuscled or out-positioned 
Duck defenders — plays they 
weren’t making earlier in the 
season.

But in the last two minutes, 

two relapses proved to be 
the costliest offensive boards 
Michigan would give up all 
season.

The first — off a missed front 

end of a one-and-one — would 
have 
given 
the 
Wolverines 

the ball up three with 1:49 to 

go. Instead, Oregon forward 
Jordan Bell grabbed the loose 
ball and went straight up to the 
basket for the put back.

“If I could, I’d do anything to 

take back that one shot,” Wilson 
said. “That offensive rebound 
on the free throw that I missed 
that resulted in two points. 
That’s the one point that really 
sticks out to me the most.”

That Bell score was the first 

of a 4-0 run that put the Ducks 
in the lead for good. After 
the second basket, Michigan 
needed another stop with less 
than a minute to go for a shot 
to win the game on the final 
possession.

The Wolverines ended up 

forcing Oregon forward Dillon 
Brooks into a rushed layup at 
the end of the shot clock, but 
left Bell free without a block out 
again. 

The forward came down with 

his second offensive rebound 
in the final two minutes, and 
Michigan had no choice but to 
foul.

Just one of 

those rebounds 
could have sent 
the Wolverines 
off 
to 
extend 

their 
lead 
or 

find a winning 
bucket.

Instead, 

their 
biggest 

weakness 
hit 

it at the worst 
possible time.

“We 
knew 

we were going to have to get 
stops down the stretch, and 
we didn’t get those stops,” said 
junior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman. “We gave up 
offensive rebounds, fly-bys on 
drives, things of that nature. 
You just can’t have that at the 
end of the game. You have to be 
standing there and get stops.”

One turnover…
… the Ducks committed in 

the second half. Michigan’s 
turnover margin was winning 
it 
games 
this 
postseason. 

The Wolverines were forcing 
opponents into 12.8 turnovers 
per game in the Big Ten and 
NCAA 
Tournaments, 
while 

only committing 7.8 per game 

themselves.

But Oregon never seemed to 

be making the passes that could 
be served up for Michigan to 
pick off. Or dribble into the 
wrong lanes. Or make the 
mistakes that could have sent 
the Wolverines into transition 
for 
a 
momentum-changing 

basket.

“I don’t think we’ve had the 

same pressure we have had in 
the past,” Abdur-Rahkman said. 
“I don’t know why. I don’t think 
it’s fatigue. They’re a great team 
that took care of the ball better 
than we did.”

Michigan’s 
defensive 

renaissance 
over 
the 
past 

couple months had winning the 
turnover battle as the keystone 
that held everything up. But 
Oregon knew if it took care of 
the basketball, they’d be in as 
good as any position to win it in 
the end.

One shot…
… More Oregon made from 

the field than Michigan. Senior 
guard 
Derrick 
Walton 
Jr’s 

pull-up jumper in the final 
seconds may stand out, but the 
Wolverines had other chances 
in the final minutes to put 
pressure on the ducks.

Walton himself had a chance 

to finish a layup — a similar look 
to the dagger he put in the final 
minute against Louisville last 
Sunday — to put Michigan up 
three, but came up too strong.

Wilson had a look from three 

after Oregon took the lead with 
a minute left, but he ended up 
air balling his chance, and the 
Ducks were bailed out.

Michigan and Oregon each 

had 58 field goal attempts. 
The Ducks made 26 shots. The 
Wolverines hit 25.

All together — that one 

offensive rebound, that one 
missing turnover, and that one 
unwise shot cost Michigan a 
one-point game in a tournament 
where you only need one loss to 
go home.

“It basically just says the 

ball didn’t go our way,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “Shots didn’t 
go in and they were the better 
team today. You only have to 
beat a team once in the NCAA 
Tournament, and they did that.”

Wolverines come up just short in three areas to end season

ANSAS CITY, Mo. — 
“Money.”

Plain and simple. 

When Derrick Walton Jr. 

pulled up from beyond the arc 
with a chance to send Michigan 
to the Elite Eight, that’s what 
Andrew Dakich thought.

That’s what Walton thought 

himself. That’s what everyone 
thought.

“You felt like it’s meant to 

fall,” said senior forward Mark 
Donnal.

But it didn’t matter that 

everyone thought it was going in. 
It mattered that everyone cared 
who took it.

With the game on the line, 

the answer was unanimous. 
The Michigan men’s basketball 
team wanted the ball in Walton’s 
hands.

That wasn’t always the case. 

“I’d do 

anything to 
take back that 

one shot.”
