CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

RESEARCH

Pending litigation 
yields student-voter 

disillusionment 

with election system

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

The closest Central Student 

Government race of the decade is 
not over yet, as ongoing litigation 
between Make Michigan and The 
Team could alter the outcome of 
the presidency.

There 
have 
been 
nine 

complaints made by both parties 
overall, but three have yet to 
be decided on and the results 
are expected to be released on 
Wednesday. Each case’s outcome 
has the potential to result in 
demerits against either party, 
and if both receive more than 10 
demerits, they will be disqualified 
from the race.

So far, The Team has received 

four demerits for destruction 
of campaign materials — party 
members 
were 
found 
guilty 

of erasing promotional Make 

Michigan chalk advertisements 
and replacing it with “Vote the 
Team.”

Neither 
party 
has 
been 

disqualified 
yet; 
however, 

individual candidates have. Art 
& Design sophomore Tanner 
Petch, a candidate for The Team, 
and 
First-year 
Law 
student 

Stevin George, a Make Michigan 
candidate, were both disqualified 
for e-mailing listservs that did not 
belong to them.

While Make Michigan has 

yet to receive any demerits, the 
results of Monday night’s hearings 
could drastically change that. The 
Team charged Make Michigan 
with harvesting 5,719 e-mails 
from listservs that were not 
theirs. If found responsible, Make 
Michigan will be penalized with 
up to more than 17,000 demerits.

Make 
Michigan 
has 
also 

alleged that The Team and its 
Representative Manager Andrew 
Loeb, an LSA senior, harvested 
534 e-mails. Subsequently, The 
Team could be charged with up to 
1,602 demerits.

Access to personal 
computers is not 
required, but many 
recognize benefits

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

College is expensive: tuition, 

rent and social expenses can add 
up to tens of thousands of dollars 
per 
year. 
Smaller 
expenses, 

including the cost of buying a 
laptop, can get lost in this grand 
total.

News 
outlets 
often 
write 

broadly about the effects of 
socioeconomic status on success 
in school, but more specifically, 
how does restricted access to 
technology impact a student at 
the University?

Students are not required 

to own laptops in the majority 
of schools and programs at the 
University. According to the 
University’s Computer Showcase 
website, the University maintains 

computing sites on both Central 
and North Campuses equipped 
with both Macs and PCs for 
student use. However, the site 
also advises students “to consider 
a laptop computer.”

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, spoke to 
this contrast in a March interview 
with The Michigan Daily.

“As you can see, in the Unions 

and every place we can, (we) have 
computers and computer centers 
available for students,” she said. 
“But we know that that’s different 
from you having your own and 
being able to have the flexibility 
of 4:00 in the morning.”

Individual school 
requirements

Students in the School of Art 

& Design are required to obtain 
a specified computer package, 
which the school website says 
they can purchase for about 
$3,500. This is the only school 
with such a requirement.

Joann 
McDaniel, 
assistant 

dean for undergraduate programs 
in the School of Art & Design, said

Prof. Stephen Strobbe’s voice 
quavered 
with 
emotion 
as 

he stood before a nearly full 

Rackham Auditorium to deliver 
a lecture during his reception 
of the Golden Apple award on 
Tuesday evening.

The Golden Apple award 

— which is sponsored by the 
University of Michigan Hillel 
and more than 30 other campus 
organizations and departments 
— is the only student-nominated 
award for student teaching.

“The Golden Apple Award 

honors those teachers who 
consistently treat every lecture 
as if it were his or her last 

chance to impart knowledge on 
their students,” said Business 
junior Jake Berman, the Golden 
Apple Committee co-chair.

This year marks the 25th 

anniversary of the award at the 
University.

The Golden Apple Award 

Committee said they received 
a record of more than 750 
nominations this year, of which 
75 were submitted for Strobbe.

Symposium proposes 
recommendations 
for new ‘U’ STEM 

initiatives

By IAN DILLINGHAM

Magazine Editor

Scientific leaders are look-

ing to lay the groundwork for 
new science policy initiatives at 
the University and beyond. The 
exploration of initiatives was dis-
cussed at the Jerome B. Wiesner 
Symposium on Tuesday.

The two-day event at Rackham 

Amphitheatre brought together 
some of the nation’s leading sci-
entific minds and policymakers to 
discuss the current state of scien-
tific research. During the sympo-
sium, attendees created a series of 
recommendations for the Univer-
sity to better engage with policy 
issues facing the field.

Topics from the conference 

covered a wide range of concerns 

Hundreds gather to 

hear arguments 

about the proposal

and LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporters

After more than four hours of 

discussion and public comments, 
the University’s Central Student 

Government voted to reject 
a resolution calling for the 
creation of an ad hoc committee 
to investigate the University’s 
investments in companies that 
allegedly facilitate human rights 
violations against Palestinians.

The resolution failed to pass 

with a vote of 15 in favor and 
29 opposed. There was one 
abstention. A roll call voted 
determined that the vote on 
the resolution would be public 

instead of a secret ballot.

The resolution asked for 

CSG to support the creation 
of a committee through the 
University’s Board of Regents 
to examine the University’s 
investments in four companies: 
Boeing Company, Caterpillar 
Inc., 
G4S 
and 
the 
United 

Technologies Corporation. The 
resolution claims these specific 
companies profit from violations 
of Palestinian human rights.

Hundreds of members of the 

University community packed 
the Rogel Ballroom in the 
Michigan Union on Tuesday 
evening to hear dozens of 
speakers express reasons to vote 
for or against the resolution. 
Similarly to last year’s CSG 
vote on a similar resolution, 
attendees entered the meeting 
on a first-come, first-served 
basis and were given tickets

CRIME ON CAMPUS

A University of California, 

Berkeley 
student 
was 
pro-

nounced dead on Monday near 
the University of Southern Cali-
fornia campus, The Daily Trojan 
reported.

19-year-old Eloi Vasquez was 

a freshman and also a member of 
Berkley’s men’s soccer team. He 
visited the USC campus this past 
weekend and had been missing 
since early Saturday morning.

Police reported that Vasquez 

was hit by a car after leaving a 
party.

Stanford University student 

accused of poisoning

A Stanford University gradu-

ate student has been charged 

with four felony counts for 
putting a chemical known as 
paraformaldehyde in the water 
bottles of the subject’s labmates’ 
water bottles, The Stanford Daily 
reported.

The 
suspect 
admitted 
to 

tampering with the bottles and 
apologized for the actions, claim-
ing to have not been conscious of 
doing so.

The suspect pleaded not guilty 

by reason of insanity.

University of Virginia releases 

sexual misconduct policy

The University of Virginia 

published a revised interim sex-
ual misconduct policy, The Cava-
lier Daily reported Monday.

The revised document estab-

lishes new policies for report-
ing 
sexual 
misconduct, 
and 

delineates the process for pro-
tecting those who undergo this 
process. Furthermore, a Student 
Resource Guide to help univer-
sity members through the new 
policy was created.

According to the new policy, a 

number of acts — including sex-
ual assault, stalking and retaliat-
ing against a person for reporting 
a violation — are explicitly pro-
hibited.

Violators of the new policy 

could face disciplinary action, a 
punishment that encompasses 
the possibility of expulsion.

Students gather 
to discuss campus 
affairs, with focus 
on dual-degrees

By COLLEEN HARRISON 

Daily Staff Reporter

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

chatted with around 40 students 
Tuesday evening to discuss a va-
riety of campus affairs.

Throughout the course of his 

first year, Martin has held simi-
lar talks on campus to offer stu-
dents the opportunity to discuss 
his administration and other top-
ics of interest. Martin held two 
talks earlier this academic year 
where he discussed the LSA Race 
and Ethnicity Requirement, and 
diversity and socioeconomic sta-
tus, among other issues.

Students led the discussion in 

a town-hall style, asking ques-
tions on topics such as adding 
potential new majors, challenges 

associated with student-athletes 
missing class for practice and 
games and the perceived discon-
nect between faculty and stu-
dents.

“We want to make sure that 

they’ve got the robust support 
necessary,” Martin said.

Many 
students 
discussed 

problems of obtaining dual-de-
gree credits, specifically the re-
striction on students within the 
Ford School of Public Policy and 
their inability to double major.

Martin said he believes hav-

ing students obtain a dual-degree 
could only help rather than hurt 
them. He said eliminating this 
policy should happen and would 
only benefit students.

LSA 
freshman 
Nicholas 

Fadanelli said he appreciated 
Martin’s discussion of some of 
the issues with majors and mi-
nors on campus.

“If you have certain programs, 

like journalism, that don’t have 
the major like they used to, or 
have the applied field outside of 
college, that having new minors 
to come to those would be very 

beneficial to LSA students so they 
could have that liberal breadth,” 
Fadanelli said.

Discussing students on cam-

pus with lower socioeconomic 
status or who find themselves 
unable to academically continue 
at the University, Martin said he 
wants to ensure that all students 
admitted to the University are 
able to stay and finish their de-
grees.

“It does happen, and we want 

to do everything we can to make 
sure that it doesn’t happen,” 
Martin said. “Every student that 
we admit to this university de-
serves to be at this university.”

As a former professor, Mar-

tin spoke about a disconnect be-
tween students and faculty at the 
University.

“Sometimes we forget what it’s 

like, sometimes it’s been many 
years since we were undergradu-
ate students,” Martin said.

LSA freshman Patrick Mullan, 

an office ambassador in the LSA 
dean’s office, said he appreciated 
Martin’s efforts to increase con-
tact between students and ad-
ministration, citing the creation 
of the ambassador program to 
further facilitate this contact.

“I’ve been working in close 

contact with him for six weeks 
and I think he did a really good 
job in an hour of reiterating what 
we’ve been working on in the of-
fice,” Mullan said.

Students in attendance also 

mentioned problems with turn-
ing a degree into a career, es-
pecially for those pursuing the 
humanities. Martin said these 
degrees do not tend to provide 
a direct path toward a career as 
majors in other fields might, but 
he said the liberal arts education 
helps turn these degrees into ca-
reers.

“The reason why the liberal 

arts education is so empower-
ing is that it allows you to look at 
things from a different perspec-
tive,” Martin said.

To help students explore ca-

reers in their fields, Martin said 
he believes the University could 
do more to assist students in 
finding sustainable careers post 
graduation.

“As a college we can do a bet-

ter job helping to connect you 
with those people,” Martin said.

Investigation into 
screenings leads to 
hospital reforms

By KATIE PENROD 

Daily Staff Reporter

Award-winning journalist Ellen 

Gabler visited campus Tuesday, 
accompanied by three professors 
and the director of the Utah 
Newborn 
Screening 
Program, 

to lead a panel discussion about 
deadly 
delays 
in 
processing 

newborn blood work and the 
severe risk these delays can pose to 
newborn health.

Gabler’s 
investigative 
series 

on delays in newborn screening 
published 
in 
the 
Milwaukee 

Journal Senteniel led to reforms at 
hospitals throughout the country. 
Her talk focused on options to 
improve the screening process and 
how hospitals and institutions can 
implement these changes.

Newborn babies have blood 

drawn to test for rare diseases 
immediately after birth. Though 
the blood work is sent to labs, the 
process of sending and screening 
is often drawn out unintentionally, 
leading to delays.

Gabler started the panel by 

discussing her interest in the 
transparency of public data as well 

as her inspiration for beginning 
this 
investigative 
series. 
She 

said one of her colleagues at the 
Milwaukee 
Journal 
Sentinel 

brought in a story about a child 
who almost died because his blood 
work screening was delayed.

Gabler 
said 
she 
realized 

this delay could be happening 
around the country, adding that 
she believed hospitals as well as 
state governments needed to be 
held accountable. She insisted 
institutions analyze how quickly 
these newborns and their parents 
get the health information they 
need so rare diseases can be 
addressed.

“Holding people accountable is 

how you make change,” she said.

Throughout the investigative 

process, Gabler said she often 
struggled 
with 
getting 
data 

from certain states and that 
governments did not always want 
to share their hospitals’ lapses in 
responsibility.

“It’s 
simply 
not 
OK 
for 

governments to just say ‘listen 
we’ve got this handled, trust us’ 
and that’s kind of what they were 
saying, and that’s just not OK,” she 
said.

Throughout her talk, Gabler 

also 
discussed 
improvements 

made across the country because 
of her investigative reports. Prior 
to her work, she said Arizona was 

one of the worst states in regard 
to timeliness of screenings, but 
after her series was published they 
had a 30 percent improvement in 
efficiency.

Panelist Edward Goldman, a 

lawyer and associate professor in 
obstetrics and gynecology, spoke 
about how the newborn screening 
process is multifaceted. He said 
because of its complicated nature, 
addressing the issue requires 
analysis of every aspect of the 
process.

“The 
testing 
is 
for 
rare 

conditions 
with 
significant 

medical implications, as you’ve 
heard,” 
Goldman 
said. 
“That 

means testing has to be fast, it 
needs to be accurate, it needs to 
be returned to physicians who 
understand the testing and can act 
on it to provide treatment. That 
should show you all the places 
where this could break down.”

The panelists discussed the 

screening process from many 
different 
perspectives. 
Sharon 

Kardia, senior associate dean for 
administration and professor of 
epidemiology, said one important 
problem 
to 
consider 
is 
the 

monetary pressure on health 
departments.

Andreas Rohrwasser said he has 

only been at his post as Newborn 
Screening Laboratory Director in 

See JOURNALIST, Page 5A


the cost of this computer package 
is included in the cost of first-year 
tuition for Art & Design students 
— which is sometimes covered by 
financial aid.

“Our students have a larger 

budget for financial aid,” she said. 
“The cost of being a freshman 
in the School of Art & Design is 
greater than the cost of being a 
freshman in, say, LSA. And the 
difference is that our students 
are required to buy a computer 
package. So it’s included as part 
of their budget — if a student 
qualifies for financial aid, then 
they get aid for their Art & Design 
tuition (including the computer 
package).”

She said students are given 

a four-year warranty for their 
purchase of the package, which is 
discounted through the Computer 
Showcase, so the laptop should be 
a one-time expense while they are 
attending the University.

McDaniel added that the Art 

& 
Design 
computer 
package 

is 
necessary 
because 
every 

discipline 
within 
the 
school 

requires a significant amount of 
computer-based work. She said 
standardizing the package puts all 
students on an equal playing field.

“When 
everybody 
has 
the 

same equipment, it’s a little bit 
like wearing a uniform,” she said. 
“(The package) doesn’t mean 
that there is perfect equity, but 
it’s one more step (towards equal 
opportunity).”

Business 

students are not required to 
purchase a laptop but are warned 
that they will likely be at a 
disadvantage in both class and 
group work if they do not own a 
personal computer. The Business 
School’s website says that while 
students do have access to several 
public-use labs around campus, 
they should consider the fact that 
space in those labs will be limited.

Similarly, 
the 
School 
of 

Information does not have any 
specific 
laptop 
requirements. 

Education and Information Prof. 
Barry Fishman said decisions 
about what technology is required 
for classes are left up to the 
instructor.

Furthermore, 
neither 
the 

School of Music, Theatre & Dance, 
the School of Kinesiology nor the 
College of Engineering require 
students to obtain a personal 
computer.

interview that LSA does not 
have a laptop policy and does not 
require students to own their own 
computers.

“While some instructors do 

encourage students to use laptops 
in their classes, other faculty 
discourage or even ban the use of 
laptops or other mobile devices 
because they find them disruptive 
and distracting for students,” she 
said.

The digital divide and equity 

of access

Dressler acknowledged that 

lacking access to a personal 
computer can be difficult for 
students, but she echoed Harper’s 
sentiment that the University 
has done its best to make up for 
potential disparities in resources.

“LSA does understand there is 

differential access to expensive 
technologies 
and 
expensive 

resources among the student 
body,” she said. “This is true 
of 
textbooks, 
co-curricular 

activities, as well as computer 
technology; and is part of a larger 
issue of access that LSA is deeply 
concerned about.”

She said the potential of a 

“digital divide” is what drives 
University investment in facilities 
like the Angell Hall Computing 
Site — known as the Fishbowl 
— and other computer labs, and 
University Housing’s investment 
in the inclusion of computing 
sites and “community learning 
centers” in all residence halls. She 
added that LSA is committed to 
providing sufficient equipment to 
support students’ completion of 
their coursework.

Dressler said in LSA classes 

that have decided to use laptops 
for collaboration or in-class work, 
LSA ISS encourages faculty to 
ensure that all students are able to 
participate through group work so 
that any students without laptops 
can engage.

She also noted that students 

can check out a laptop from LSA 
Instructional Support Services for 
this type of in-class use. According 
to the LSA ISS website, there are 
three equipment loan centers 
on Central Campus — in Mason 
Hall and the Modern Language 
Building, from which “students 
enrolled in an LSA course may 
check out a wide variety” of 
equipment for short-term use. 
Long-term loan requests require 
additional paperwork.

In an e-mail interview, Kedra 

Ishop, associate vice president for 
enrollment management at the 
University, said students should 
not and do not appear to feel 
discouraged from taking classes 
in technology-heavy fields — even 
if they lack access to relevant 
technology.

“The 
colleges 
and 
schools 

work hard to direct students to 
resources and our application 
numbers 
to 
technology-rich 

majors don’t suggest that students 
are not pursuing their areas 
of interest because of a lack of 
access,” she said.

Fishman 
said 
the 
“digital 

divide” 
is 
clearly 
and 

fundamentally an equity issue 
because students with personal 
laptops have a much easier time 
getting their work done.

“Even when you provide a full 

scholarship to college, there’s all 
these unintended costs of college 
— so just buying books can be a 
struggle,” he said. “And if you can 
afford to buy all the books that are 
on your course list and have them 
in your dorm room, that gives 
you an inherent advantage over 
someone who has to go read them 
on reserve all of the time. It’s the 
same thing with laptops and other 
kinds of technology.”

Fishman 
said 
instructors 

should be aware of what “implicit 
assumptions” their course syllabi 
make about their students’ access 
to certain resources, such as 
technology.

He said there are many contexts 

in which instructional technology 
is an imperative element of the 
learning process, but added that 
instructors should consider how 
to make the required technology 
available to all students.

Limited access

LSA senior Cesar Vargas, a 

senior computer consultant in 
the Fishbowl, said space there is 
limited, especially during peak 
times and around finals, because 
students both with and without 
laptops come to use its study space 
and other resources.

“Especially when it comes 

to finals, we have to open up 
the Angell Hall classrooms for 
overflow,” he said.

LSA senior Kelsey Pakkala, 

another computer consultant in 
the Fishbowl, said even students 
with laptops come there to use 
expensive software the University 
provides for free to students on its 
computers.

“There’s SAS, SPSS, MatLab 

— it’s around $150 to buy that 
software,” she said. “Students 
who have laptops can’t afford 
that, so they come here. They’re 
subscription-based (and have to be 
renewed every year), but they’re 
free on campus.”

Pakkala also said she frequently 

sees people in the Fishbowl using 
the desktops to watch TV shows 
because they have bigger screens 
than laptops.

Vargas said the 2013 renovations 

to the site were intended to 
make additional lounge space for 
students using laptops, but added 
that he regularly finds students 
sitting at the desktop computer 
spaces 
using 
their 
personal 

laptops instead.

“There are definitely a lot of 

students that come up to us and 
complain that they see a lot of 
students in front of a desktop and 
a laptop and the desktop is off 
and they’re just on the laptop,” he 
said. “The main problem is people 
not understanding that there are 
students that obviously do need 
these desktops.”

He said that not having his 

own personal computer to use 
would certainly be an obstacle, 
especially because it can be hard 
to find a computer to use at campus 
computing sites.

“I was a first-generation student 

— I could definitely see not having 
a laptop as a huge disadvantage,” 
he said.

Pakkala said she believes the 

University 
has 
gotten 
better 

over time at providing resources 
for students without personal 
computers.

“(The Fishbowl) is 24/7 almost 

every day, I know the UGLi is 24/7 
all of the time — during peak hours 
obviously, that’s the bad times,” 
she said. “There’s a lot of options 
if you’re flexible with when you’re 
willing to work.”

Dressler said she does not 

know of any research that found 
drawbacks of not owning one’s 
own 
personal 
computer, 
but 

recognized the benefits of owning 
a personal computer.

“One might imagine a benefit 

of having one’s own computer 
because it would allow a student to 
work on her or his own schedule.”

LSA junior Ricardo Rubio said 

he comes to the Fishbowl and 
other campus computing sites to 
complete all the work he cannot 
get done on his iPad, which does 
not have programs like Microsoft 
Word and SPSS. He said he finds 
the sites convenient, and that he is 
always able to finish his work.

“I don’t necessarily need a 

laptop,” he said. “I am able to 
do everything that I need to get 

done.”

Funding for technological 

expenses

Fishman noted that the way 

people choose to pay for college — 
including loans and scholarships, 
among other financial plans — 
can affect how they finance the 
technology they buy for school.

“You can only use some of those 

resources to pay for technology if 
the technology is required by the 
syllabus,” he said.

Depending on how students 

pay for college, Fishman said, 
they may find it helpful for their 
respective schools to require 
certain technology rather than 
suggest students obtain it.

Ishop 
said 
the 
Office 
of 

Financial Aid considers many 
factors in addition to the cost 
of tuition when offering aid to 
students.

“A student’s Cost of Attendance 

is based on estimated student 
budgets that include not only 
tuition/fees and housing, but also 
books/supplies 
and 
personal/

miscellaneous 
expenses,” 
she 

wrote. “Those students who are 
unable to purchase a computer 
may acquire additional financial 
aid to purchase a computer once 
during their educational career at 
the University.”

“Other 
required 
technology 

also can be included in financial 
aid,” University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail 
interview. “Students simply need 
to provide documentation that the 
technology is required for a class.”

Ishop and Fitzgerald also said 

the University is piloting a laptop 
loan program in Fall 2015 with 
LSA. The initiative will provide 
the opportunity for incoming first-
year students with the greatest 
financial need to receive a laptop 
from LSA to use for the entirety 
of their academic career at the 
University.

director, said in an interview 
Sunday that the potential demerits 
could result in the disqualification 
of both major parties and their 
entire slates of candidates.

If this were to happen, she said 

the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party would win the election, and 
LSA junior Keysha Wall and LSA 
sophomore Katie Kennedy would 
respectively become president and 
vice president of CSG. In addition, 
all members of each disqualified 
party in the legislative branches 
would be removed as well — 
meaning that only DAAP and 
independent 
candidates 
would 

remain in power.

Though 22 percent of the 

University student body voted 
in this year’s election, the voter 
turnout was actually one of the 
highest returns in recent years.

DAAP received 742.05 votes — 

17 percent total, which is less than 
a quarter of what The Team or 
Make Michigan received. Though 
last week’s election was decided by 
five votes, the chance that the final 
outcome could be determined by 
litigation — not the popular vote — 
has lead some students to question 

how much their participation 
really matters.

LSA freshman Molly Aronson 

said she felt it was her responsibility 
to vote regardless of how much of 
an impact doing so actually had on 
the election results. However, she 
added, the trials take away from the 
significance of that responsibility.

“I think that this definitely 

undermines 
the 
student 
vote 

because 
considering 
if 
the 

litigations go through neither of 
the top two parties will actually 
have control,” Aronson said. “I do 
think that’s telling.”

LSA freshman Kate Stankey 

expressed disappointment in the 
litigation and said CSG was not 
maintaining a real democracy. 
She also called the process for 
enforcing election code violations 
as “flawed.”

“I don’t think it typically follows 

the democratic government that 
the CSG should,” she said.

Stankey 
also 
expressed 

discontent 
with 
parties’ 

campaigning in the weeks leading 
up to the election, adding that it 
may have dissuaded students from 
caring about the election.

“I don’t think many people 

were 
very 
interested 
in 
the 

election, especially when they 
were 
campaigning 
and 
they 

were bothering a lot of students,” 
Stankey said. “I think that made 
the student body pretty upset.”

Stankey said the individual 

candidates also deterred interest. 
She 
cited 
The 
Team’s 
vice 

presidential 
candidate, 
LSA 

sophomore Matt Fidel, a current 
CSG representative, due to his 
attendance at the Sigma Alpha Mu 
ski trip.

LSA junior Evan Gerstein said 

he did not know either major 
party’s platform and only voted for 
people whom he knew personally. 
He said campaigning on either side 
had no effect on his vote, which 
made him question the necessity of 
the efforts.

“The presidential party vote 

was separated by five, so clearly 
my vote actually had an impact, 
because I voted for an actual 
party,” Gerstein said. “At the same 
time, it didn’t really matter as 
much, because I didn’t know any of 
the candidates because they didn’t 
campaign well. Sure I saw Make 
Michigan, actually I saw more of 
The Team, with their chalking 
and everything, but I don’t know 
the platform; I don’t know the 
president; I only knew my friends 
who were representatives and I 
voted for them.”

Aronson 
took 
the 
opposite 

approach, 
noting 
that 
while 

students care about the selection 
of the CSG president, she doubts 
how much party platforms really 
matter.

“To an extent, I think people 

do care who the face of student 
government is,” Aronson said.

The last time a party secured 

executive seats through litigation 
after losing the initial election 
was in 2013. In that election, 
youMICH’s Michael Proppe, a 
current Business graduate student, 
and Bobby Dishell, current CSG 
president and Public Policy senior, 
assumed office without having 
won the popular vote.

Dishell went on to become CSG 

president in 2014 on the Make 
Michigan ticket. If Make Michigan 
were to officially secure the seats 
upon conclusion of litigation, this 
would be the second consecutive 
year that the incumbent party 
holds office.

Law student John Lin, CSG 

student general counsel and a 
member of the current Make 
Michigan executive team, said 
the continuation of the party’s 
power results from the lack of a 
large priority shift for the student 
population in the last few years.

“It means there’s a consistent 

philosophy,” Lin said. “The Make

once allowed into the room. 
Department of Public Safety 
and Security officers monitored 
the entire meeting from both 
inside and outside the room 
and officers organized a line for 
people to enter the meeting.

CSG speaker Christian Bashi, 

an LSA senior, said Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs staff was 
available outside the meeting 
room for students who felt they 
needed a break from the meeting 
to speak with someone.

Students Allied for Freedom 

and Equality is the University’s 
chapter of Students for Justice 
in Palestine, an organization 
that advocates for Palestinian 
solidarity across campuses. One 
of the group’s main initiatives is 
promoting the Boycott, Divest 
and Sanctions movement. As 
defined by BDS, divestment calls 
for institutions to divest from 
companies involved in alleged 
violations of Palestinian human 
rights.

The 
meeting 
began 
with 

guest speaker Ali Abunimah, a 
Palestinian American journalist 
who writes for The Chicago 

Tribune and The Los Angeles 
Times, speaking in favor of the 
divestment resolution.

Abunimah called the situation 

in Palestine an emergency and 
said social change needs to 
occur. He said he did not believe 
a peace process is currently 
being discussed between Israel 
and Palestine.

“Just a few weeks ago, the 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu was re-elected after 
publicly repudiating the two-
state solution and saying he 
would never allow a Palestinian 
state on his watch,” he said.

Abunimah 
compared 

divestment from the companies 
listed 
in 
the 
resolution 
to 

divestment for apartheid South 
Africa.

“We heard the argument 

divestment is divisive,” he said. 
“But, who looks back now and 
says divestment in Africa was a 
mistake.”

History 
Prof. 
Victor 

Lieberman, 
who 
currently 

teaches the course “The History 
of the Arab-Israeli Conflict,” 
spoke against the divestment 
resolution. At last year’s meeting 
concerning a similar divestment 
resolution, Lieberman offered

on topics of their choice as if it 
were their last opportunity to 
do so. Strobbe was learned of his 
selection for the Golden Apple 
award in February.

In his lecture, titled “Lessons 

from an Imperfect Life: A 
Premature 
Last 
Lecture,” 

Strobbe discussed how students’ 
anonymous 
nomination 

comments were made available 
to him upon his selection.

Strobbe said his purpose for 

talking about the comments 
was twofold. First, he said, 
he wanted faculty, staff and 
administrators to hear what 
students said they valued in 
a teacher. Second, he wanted 
students to reflect upon their 
comments and their collective 
importance.

“Remember that if these 

qualities 
were 
important 

to you as students, they’re 
undoubtedly 
important 
to 

others, including the patients 
who you will treat,” he said.

Stobbe said many of the 

comments 
addressed 
his 

approach to the difficult and 
challenging themes dealt with 
in his class, Mental Health and 
Illness Across the Lifespan.

“My stated overarching goal 

is ... to help students develop 
the skills and knowledge to 

talk to anyone about anything, 
generally during one of the 
most difficult and vulnerable 
periods of their lives,” he said.

Strobbe mentioned his own 

experience recovering from 
drug and alcohol addiction, 
and said he does not withhold 
that 
information 
from 
his 

students.

“I 
don’t 
share 
that 

information as something to 
draw attention to myself,” he 
said. “I think it’s important for 
us to humanize this solution 
to 
challenge 
preconceived 

notions of and convey a sense 
of home.”

Strobbe’s former students 

said his honesty distinguishes 
him as an influential professor.

“His genuineness made the 

whole semester easier for other 
people, for us as students, 
for us to be open and genuine 
about mental illness or all of 
these (things) that are pretty 
controversial or stigmatized 
… in normal conversation,” 
Nursing senior Allison Kosaian 
said.

Nursing senior Maggie Craft 

expressed similar sentiments 
about Strobbe’s teaching style.

“This kind of transparency 

and being so emotionally open 
is something we saw the entire 
semester,” Craft said. “The 
genuineness is completely who 
he is.”

Michigan/youMICH strand is very 
focused on certain issues, working 
on small tangible goals, whereas 
the other party, The Team, and 
FORUM before that, were very 
idealistic, kind of going for big 
moves: more culture, more social 
justice.”

He noted that if Make Michigan 

does maintain its win, there will 

not be a large shift in the approach 
to campus issues and resulting 
policies 
created 
by 
student 

government.

“I think that you’re not going to 

see much of a change in terms of 
culture and student government 
priorities,” Lin said. “Personally, 
I think that’s a good thing, other 
people might not.”

O

n Thursday, March 26, the 
Muslim Students’ Association 
and Students Allied for Free-

dom and Equality 
co-hosted an event 
titled 
“Confront-

ing Islamophobia.” 
The event was a 
panel followed by 
a question-answer 
session with guest 
speakers 
Dawud 

Walid, the execu-
tive director of the 
Michigan chapter 
of the Council on 
American-Islamic Relations; Fatina 
Abdrabboh, the director of the Amer-
ican-Arab Anti-discrimination Com-
mittee; and Sheikh Yassir Fazaga, who 
is on the advisory board of the Islamic 
Studies program at Claremont Gradu-
ate School.

The panelists covered many aspects 

of Islamophobia and its effects on Mus-
lims and American society. One aspect 
that the speakers highlighted was the 
problems associated with oversimpli-
fying Muslims and how Muslims, in 
turn, deal with their Muslim identity.

When asked about the effects of 

Islamophobia on Muslim identity, 
Walid explained that he has seen a mix 
of responses from Muslims. He reflect-
ed on how after 9/11 many Muslims 
changed their names to hide their Mus-
lim identities, but he also explained 
how he saw Muslims embracing their 
identities. Walid said, “I also saw this, 
especially in Dearborn, where there 
was a group of younger Muslim ladies 
who weren’t wearing hijab who also 
began to start wearing their hijab 
almost as a form of resistance and 
showing off their identity.”

Walid’s example highlighted an 

instance in which Muslim women 
decided to wear hijab voluntarily, 
another narrative not commonplace in 
the media. Abdrabboh expanded on the 
media’s oversimplification of Muslims, 

using Muslim women as an example: 
“Somehow there is a green light that 
our very womanhood can be described 
as cheap, or as you know, with one sen-
tence, genie in a bottle or you know 
burkha head to toe, abused, the whole 
stereotype.” She then continued to 
explain how this stereotype should be 
viewed in the broader context of wom-
en’s issues in America.

So, let’s talk about the stereotypical 

Muslim woman in this context of wom-
en’s issues in America.

The idea that somehow the only 

way a woman can be liberated is if she 
abides by the impossible expectations 
set by society is a problem that women 
in America face. Women are expected 
to be proud of their bodies and put them 
on display as people point out every 
flaw and imperfection. A confident 
woman is seen as someone who dresses 
a certain way with the right body.

The stereotype that the Mus-

lim woman who wears a hijab is 
oppressed and in need of saving is a 
misconception that portrays the idea 
that a Muslim woman isn’t capable of 
making her own choice — specifical-
ly to wear the hijab. The idea that a 
Muslim woman is in need of saving is 
parallel to the narrative of the dam-
sel in distress ingrained in society.

I am not a damsel in distress and I do 

not need saving.

So when I tell you that I’m very 

aware of the decision that I have 
made to wear my hijab, I would hope 
that you understand that it was an 
informed decision that I am com-
pletely capable of making.

Wearing hijab to me is an act of 

servitude to God and my understand-
ing of His infinite wisdom. Everyday 
I wake up and am reminded that I am 
a Muslim as I carefully pin my hijab 
to ensure that all my hair is covered 
and check my clothes to see if they are 
loose-fitting. It keeps me aware of my 
faith and away from being influenced 
by the media, which places impossible 

expectations on women’s beauty. Peo-
ple continue to view the Muslim heads-
carf as oppressive by separating it from 
the long standing tradition of women of 
faith covering their head.

When you meet me, you confront 

my faith — my success in explaining to 
others why exactly I wear hijab has had 
varying success.

When confronted about by my 

hijab, people often ask me what I 
am. If you ask me what I am, I’ll tell 
you I’m human.

If you ask me where I’m really from, 

I’ll explain again that I was born and 
raised in America and that my first lan-
guage is English.

In frustration, you ask me where 

my parents are from; I’ll tell you they 
are South Asian.

Finally you can whisk away my pre-

vious remarks and put me in one of 
your boxes, although the answer you 
were hoping for was Arab.

You may think that my hijab is 

slowing me down, but it only makes 
me focus more on what is really 
important to me. I am one of those 
snowboarding, 
poetry 
slamming, 

fun-loving hijabis that will not be 
constrained by stereotypes.

And so when you ask me who is 

making me wear my hijab, I’ll explain 
that it is a choice I made as I believe 
it as the command of God to dress 
modestly. With a concerned look you 
reply, “But you are in America, you 
can be liberated here.”

In my eyes there’s nothing more lib-

erating than the feeling I get when I 
wear my hijab. I put it on with the hopes 
to impress God and no one else. So 
when people confuse something I see 
as a beautiful act of worship with some-
thing inherently oppressive, it’s dis-
tressing. I hope that people will begin to 
learn more about hijab and Islam before 
making such assumptions.

“Girl crush” on country 

MELISSA 
SCHOLKE

I am a survivor. I am a survivor 

of sexual assault. I am a survivor of 
sexual violence. I am a survivor.

It took me a long time to feel like I 

could claim this identity. I didn’t like 
the term, the way it implied that I had 
the choice to give up, or as if I was car-
rying that weight with me wherever I 
went. The thing was that I was carrying 
it, every day, every moment, wherever 
I was. I would hear someone use the 
r-word, in class, in a joke, in passing, and 
felt myself shut down, check out, physi-
cally and mentally disassociate.

For the longest time, I didn’t want 

to call myself a survivor. I didn’t know 
how I felt about the term “victim,” and 
more than anything, I did not want 
those instances, those times, to define 
who I was. I have found that I tend to 
shut things out, black out memories, 
forgive too easily, attempt to forget. In 
ignoring the hurt, I failed to begin the 
process of healing.

When I signed up for a conference 

called “Culture Shift” on campus, I 
didn’t know it was about sexual assault 
and violence on campus. I wasn’t 
ready for what I found myself thrown 
into. After the first evening, I wasn’t 
sure if I would go back the next day, I 
wasn’t ready to talk about these things 
with my peers. I had never understood 
the speak-out events in which survi-
vors told their stories. They triggered 
me and reminded me of things I was 
trying so hard to forget.

But I decided to go back. I chal-

lenged myself to share with this group 
of strangers that I was a survivor. I 
didn’t need to tell him anymore, I 
didn’t need to explain myself, and if 
I ever felt like I could not handle it, I 
knew I could leave.

I almost did leave multiple times 

that day. Near the end of the day, they 
asked us to make signs that said, “I stand 
with survivors because …” or “I stand 
against sexual assault because ...” I spent 
what felt like ages staring at the paper, 
not knowing what to write, and when 
I finally did it the sign said, “I stand 
with survivors because … I am one and 
I no longer want to live in fear in my 
own community.”

Claiming the identity of a survivor 

has helped me to begin on the path 
of healing. Sharing that day, holding 
up my sign for others to see and ver-
bally saying that to my peers, without 
any judgment, without any pity, made 
me realize just how much I had been 
holding myself back. By attempting to 
forget these parts of my history and 
identity, I had been allowing them to 
control me even more.

A couple of weeks after the confer-

ence I went to the peer-led Support 
Group with SAPAC. Another girl 
from the conference was there, just 
the two of us, both totally new, and 
the facilitators. We didn’t have to talk 
about anything we didn’t want to, 
we didn’t have to share. But I knew 
that I could. We talked about coping 
mechanisms and how we had been. 
And while we didn’t share our whole 
stories, I found a safe space in these 
people. I went back the next week, 
and plan on continuing to do so.

I want to start to tell my story 

so that I can start to heal. I wasn’t 
ready to call myself a survivor 
before, I wasn’t ready to start that 
healing process, and I know that 
there are many people who are not 
either. But I can now understand the 
power in sharing our stories. The 
power in reclaiming ourselves and 
our memories without letting them 
define us, just acknowledging how 
they shape us.

In April 2014, I was assaulted by 

someone who I thought was a good 
friend, someone who was close to my 
partner at the time, someone I trust-
ed. My partner pushed me to press 
charges, and I did, just to be told later 
by the judge that my actions were not 
reflective of someone who was being 
assaulted. I was being blamed by the 
government, being told that I should 
have said, “no more,” louder, should 
not have let them come to my place in 
the first place.

Almost a year later, I am still work-

ing to heal and process. My partner 
left me, in many ways because I think 
that they felt they needed to do the 
same, and for each of us, that looked 
different. But after a year, after that 
conference, after sharing myself with 

a group of strangers and peers, after 
finally admitting to myself that I am 
a survivor and that I am carrying that 
weight with me wherever I go, I can 
finally reclaim myself.

In August 2009, at the age of 16, I 

was assaulted by two men in my sub-
urban hometown outside of Boston. I 
spent that fall in the mental hospital, 
and the following years doing trauma-
focused CBT, DBT and other types of 
therapy to help with my PTSD and 
severe depression. I faked my way 
through most of it, feeling that if I 
lied and said that I was okay, that the 
pain would go away. It wasn’t until last 
spring that I realized just how much 
healing I had neglected to do. I real-
ized just how much of myself I had 
tried to erase.

When people ask whether there 

is one thing I would go back and do 
differently, I think about this weight 
that I carry and I wonder what I 
would do differently. A lot? Noth-
ing? Regardless of the alternate 
realities I could live in, I am here 
in this one and I wouldn’t change 
a thing. I will only make the choice 
to continue the process of healing 
as I move forward. I will not black 
out years of my life or moments in 
time because of the pain. I will work 
through them and understand why 
they are important in who I am.

It took me five years to call myself 

a survivor. We all heal in different 
ways and at different rates. I wasn’t 
ready to share my story before, to 
claim this identity, but I now under-
stand why others could and have. It 
is not so that others can hear their 
stories and say, “What strong peo-
ple, how much we must change.” 
This is a part of it, but that is not 
why I, as a survivor, want to tell 
my story. I want to tell my story so 
I can say that this is what has hap-
pened to me, but this does not define 
me. This is what I come from, but 
it is not who I am. I am more than 
those who blamed me, more than 
the decision of the judge or the lost 
friendships. I am reclaiming myself.

I am a survivor

RABAB 
JAFRI

I

f you know me closely, I make my predilec-
tion for music apparent. My iPod isn’t just 
a device I carry with me on my walks to 

class, on jogs or during study 
sessions at the library; it’s an 
appendage. My conversations 
— perhaps to the chagrin of 
my friends and roommates — 
revolve almost solely around 
newly released singles, the 
quality of recent music vid-
eos and album critiques. I’ll 
often surprise (read: annoy) 
my friends with random bio-
graphical tidbits about artists 
when we’re riding in the car 
and listening to the radio. My love for music is 
easily described as an obsession lingering on the 
cusp of an addiction.

I proudly (and quite frequently) declare my 

immense appreciation for indie and pop art-
ists, like Florence and the Machine, Marina and 
the Diamonds, and Bastille. Despite my self-
declared status as an indie and pop music aficio-
nado, country music — much to the surprise of 
my friends — is a genre that remains entwined 
in the measures of my life. Scroll through my 
music library, and you’ll discover a small selec-
tion of country amid tracks my mother prefers 
to call “my weird music.”

I vividly remember her shock when she heard 

“Amazed” by Lonestar playing from my iPod. 
Admittedly the song is a bit before my time, but 
it’s connected to a memory. Memory and recol-
lection are the forces responsible for my country 
music appreciation. Contrary to what some may 
suppose, a love for country music is not hard-
wired into my DNA because I’m a Yooper. Rather, 
the genre connects me to recollections of every-
thing I have left behind in the Upper Peninsula. I 
can vividly remember the nights my cousin and I 
would sing along to Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel 
like a Woman” when we were little girls.

Fast forward to our first summer back home 

from college, the incessant plays of “Cruise” by 
Florida Georgia Line on the radio quickly led it 
to acquiring the title of the “song of the summer” 
among my friends. Whether it involved awkward 
school dances, sitting around a bonfire during 
summer nights, driving with friends or even 
going to the bar with my family when I was back 
in the U.P. during holiday breaks, country music 
was most likely playing in the background.

My fondness for the genre occasionally leads 

to defending it when people refer to it as “hick 
music.” As my mother once aptly explained, 
country is music meant for common, everyday 
people. It’s a relatable depiction of working-class 
life, which easily explains its popularity in areas 
like the U.P. I look fondly upon my hometown 
and love the people who reside there. However, 
like some residents of that same area, country 
music, in recent years, continues to uphold prob-
lematic and archaic ideologies I passionately 
 

disagree with.

Despite the progress made toward obtain-

ing marriage equality and other rights for the 
LGBTQ community in recent years, various com-
munities across the country continue to display 
vehement disgust and prejudice toward anything 
remotely homosexual appearing in the public 
arena. A subset of country music listeners can 
now be added to the list.

Within the last week, a single released by 

Grammy-winning country group Little Big Town 
became an object of controversy, as an abundance 
of listeners nationwide experienced selective 
hearing. Meant as a song about a woman desir-
ing the physical features of her ex-boyfriend’s 
current girl and wishing she possessed those 
attributes in order to win back the guy, the track 
entitled “Girl Crush” was viewed as propaganda 
to “promote the gay agenda.”

Focusing solely upon lyrics like “I want to 

taste her lips/Yeah ‘cause they taste like you/I 
want to drown myself/In a bottle of her per-
fume,” angry listeners ignored the rest of the 
song and automatically thought the track was 
about a lesbian relationship. Parents active-
ly opposed the notion that their children be 
exposed to such material. As a result, the track 
was removed from radio stations playlists, and 
its radio rankings plummeted to No. 33.

The fact a song mistaken for presenting a 

homosexual relationship caused such an incen-
diary uproar only further illustrates the flawed 
nature of our media industry. Country music, in 
its contemporary state, features sexually explicit 
lyrics and objectified descriptions of submissive 
female conquests in order to appeal to a hetero-
sexual male audience. This trend, accurately 
described as “Nashville’s bro explicit adventures” 
in a Washington Post article was mocked by two 
young country starlets Maddie and Tae when 
they wrote a “Girl in a Country Song” to illustrate 
the ridiculously sexist representations of women 
in many of today’s country songs.

Taking into account that I can remember 

hearing Big & Rich’s highly suggestive track 
“Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” frequently as 
a 10-year-old in 2004 when it was released, 
I find it hard to understand why sugges-
tive, sexually explicit and misogynistic lyr-
ics aren’t as concerning as the possibility of 
a song portraying a romantic relationship 
between two women or two men.

The “gay agenda” parents and politicians 

are exceedingly suspicious of creeping up in 
our media and “infecting” the minds of chil-
dren, in reality, is exactly the same as the agen-
da of every human being. Humans, regardless 
of sexual orientation, want to appreciate the 
everyday, to be respected, to experience love, 
to enjoy our family and our friends, to have 
fun, to grow as individuals and to sort out 
our place in the world — basically partaking 
in every theme ever discussed in a song. The 
entire point of creative expression, whether 
in the form of writing, artwork or song, is to 
encompass and celebrate the entirety of expe-
riences available to humanity.

Considering the ever-present struggle to both 

extend and ensure basic rights to the LGBTQ 
community, trying to enclose children and the 
general public in a world of heteronormativity 
will only further inhibit future legislative and 
societal progress. Music provides an excellent 
example of this. If you refuse to expose a student 
of any age to a subsection of notes solely because 
some individuals incorrectly deem them immor-
al or inappropriate, their ability to comprehend 
and play music — possibly music they strongly 
identify with or enjoy — will be limited. Limiting 
awareness of the world will likewise inhibit the 
ability to enact future change we need.

Not a damsel in distress

When I showed up to my first Relay for Life 

event my freshman year of high school, I had 
no connection to cancer. Sure, it was inspiring 
to see my friend Marissa fight against cancer 
so passionately, but I never felt a ton of emo-
tion toward the cause. Just a few weeks after 
attending my first Relay, my grandpa got up 
early from the lunch table after a round of golf 
and said, “I gotta go, I have an appointment.” 
When my mom asked what was wrong the reply 
was, “Just a tickle in my throat. Probably just 
a cold.” My grandpa was a doctor. A Michigan 
alum. He knew what was wrong, right?

After a week, the diagnosis of Stage 1 thy-

roid cancer came to my family. He waited a 
week to start treatment because the doctor 
said it wasn’t too urgent. I wasn’t worried. 
This is a man who had served in Korea, raised 
seven kids and gone to Egypt eight weeks after 
having knee-replacement surgery.

After a week, it had progressed extremely rap-

idly. The treatment plan changed. Chemotherapy 
once a week and radiation twice a day, seven days 
a week. When I looked up his actual diagnosis, 
Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer, I read some pretty 
scary stuff. “Anaplastic tumors are the least com-
mon (only 1% of thyroid cancer cases) and most 
deadly of all thyroid cancers. This cancer has a 
very low cure rate with the very best treatments. 
Most patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer do 
not live 1 year from the day they are diagnosed.”

As his condition worsened, we did get to spend 

more time with him. My mom went to help 
my grandma cook dinner while my sister and I 
watched TV with my grandpa. When he became 
too ill to eat solid food, I made him my famous fro-
zen chocolate mousse pie. To this day, some of my 
best memories are sitting with him on the couch 
listening to him yell at Tiger Woods to let some-
one else win for a change.

After less than 90 days, we were told he would 

live three more days without treatment or three 
months living in the hospital. Ultimately, he 
decided that having three months staring at a 
hospital wall and having everyone worry wasn’t 
worth it. My aunts and uncles flew in from San 
Francisco, Manhattan and Savannah to say good-
bye. He passed away after we had all left for the 
night, holding a picture of my grandma.

Even though cancer stole my grandpa, it 

brought my family closer together. Before his 
diagnosis, we hadn’t seen my uncle from Savan-
nah for years. Now he comes to visit us twice a 
year. We started a family e-mail chain and shared 
our favorite stories and quotes about grandpa. 
Now, when I ask for support for Relay, I get notes 
from all my aunts and uncles saying how proud 
my grandpa would be. All that makes me feel like 
I’m doing all I can to honor his memory.

After my grandpa’s passing, I have watched 

countless friends and families be affected by 
this disease. When I was 15, my friend Matt’s 
dad died from cancer. When I was 16, my friend 
Angela’s dad died in less than 60 days from his

diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. One 
week to the day after he passed, my 
best friend Anna’s mom was diag-
nosed with breast cancer. Three 
months later, my aunt was diagnosed 
with breast cancer. The list goes on 
and on, unfortunately with more peo-
ple losing their battles than winning.

Every time I go to an MRelay 

meeting, all of these people are in my 

thoughts. I Relay so nobody else has to 
go through what my friends and fam-
ily did. I Relay because I know that, in 
my lifetime, we will find a cure. Grand-
pa was a doctor, and when my mom 
used to ask how his day was when he 
got home, he’d say, “just another day of 
saving lives and stamping out disease.” 
Well, I want to stamp out this disease. 
I have seen what MRelay can do, rais-

ing more than $1,000,000 in the last 
three years. I know we are making a 
difference, and I’m so excited to see 
what we can do together this year.

Please join us on April 11 at 10 a.m. 

on Palmer Field to help finish the fight 
against cancer. Visit mrelay.org for

‘Genes for Good’ study 
could predict diseases

‘U’ researchers 

analyze fluxuation in 
wages and poverty, 
among other factors

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Doctors may soon be able to 

predict if patients will develop a 
particular disease based on their 
genes and lifestyle.

University 
researchers 

launched a study Tuesday titled 
“Genes for Good,” which aims 
to collect health and genetic 
information to better understand 
human health and preventative 
medicine. The study is co-led 
by Biostatistics Prof. Goncalo 
Abecasis 
and 
Scott 
Vrieze, 

assistant professor of psychology 
and neuroscience at the University 
of Colorado at Boulder.

Vrieze wrote in an e-mail 

interview that the goal of Genes 
for Good aligns with the aim of 
the Precision Medicine Initiative, 
which was announced during 
President Barack Obama’s State of 
the Union Address in January.

Obama 
characterized 
the 

initiative as a research effort to 
“revolutionize” how diseases are 
treated. The program was launched 
with a $215 million investment in 
the president’s 2016 budget.

The initiative aims to help 

clinicians 
provide 
the 
best 

possible care for patients by taking 
the patients’ genes, environments 

and lifestyles into account when 
determining medical treatments.

“What we’re doing is not unlike 

that which is being proposed 
and discussed for the new NIH 
Precision Medicine Initiative,” 
Vrieze wrote.

Abecasis 
said 
the 
recent 

technological 
advances 
have 

facilitated 
biomedical 
data 

analysis, 
which 
traditionally 

has been the limiting factor. He 
said researchers now need ways 
to generate and collect a large 
dataset of genetic and health 
information for analysis.

“One of the questions we were 

interested in was figuring out how 
to engage large numbers of people 
in research in a cost-effective 
manner,” 
Abecasis 
said. 
“By 

reaching large numbers of people, 
we can explore questions that 
can’t be tackled in small studies.”

Genes 
for 
Good 
collects 

health information by having its 
participants 
complete 
various 

health and lifestyle surveys. Once 
a certain number of surveys are 
completed, the participants can 
send in saliva samples to get their 
genes analyzed.

The 
genetic 
information 

includes 
details 
about 
an 

individual’s ancestry, such as 
what fraction of a patient’s genes 
originated from which continents.

Though participants can also 

download a full copy of the genetic 
information compiled through 
the project, the information will 
not be completely user-friendly in 
its current form.

“(It) is probably more useful 

for aficionados at the moment,” 
Abecasis said. “But that will 
become gradually more useful as 
more annotation services become 
available.”

Currently, 
the 
study 
uses 

Facebook as a platform to engage 
and reach out to a large, diverse 
group of people.

“We thought Facebook would 

be a place where many people 
already spent time as part of their 
regular routine,” Abecasis said. 
“And that perhaps they might 
answer some questions about 
their health as a small addition to 
that routine.”

Abecasis also said his team is 

currently working on a mobile 
version of the app to reach more 
individuals.

Rackham 
student 
Shweta 

Ramdas said she participated 
in Genes for Good because she 
wanted to contribute to the 
ongoing research.

“I saw this as win-win, really,” 

Ramdas said. “It’s also a great 
feeling 
knowing 
that 
you’re 

contributing to a research study, 
even if in a small way.”

Ramdas, 
who 
is 
studying 

bioinformatics, 
said 
she 

participated because her research 
project centers on human genetics. 
However, she wants to see others 
who do have background in 
genetics to participate in the 
study as well.

“I’d also want my non-Ph.D. 

friends to get excited about 
genetics 
and 
its 
increasing 

presence in our lives over the next 
few decades,” Ramdas said.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

James S. Jackson, professor of psychology, health behavior, and health education, speaks at the Jerome B. Wiesner 
Symposium “Strengthening the Roles of Universities in National Science Policymaking: Education, Research, and Engage-
ment” at the Rackham Building on Monday. 

within the scientific community: 
the lack of scientific representa-
tion in policymaking, the need for 
improved scientific communica-
tion to the public, the challenges 
facing STEM education and the 
concerns over a lack of diversity in 
scientific fields.

The recommendations were 

presented by School of Educa-
tion Dean Deborah Ball and Ros-
ina Bierbaum, former dean of the 
School of Natural Resources and 
Environment and current mem-
ber of President Obama’s Council 
of Advisors on Science and Tech-
nology. The list included improv-
ing science policy education for 
students, offering resources to 
faculty to support science com-
munication and fostering engage-
ment between the University, 
state government and federal gov-
ernment in policymaking.

Education

Several presenters discussed 

ways for Universities to potential-
ly improve the quality of under-
graduate education in STEM 
fields. The most pressing need 
identified was for students in sci-
ence to gain a better understand-
ing of science policy in the future.

Currently, the University offers 

a certificate program for graduate 
students in Science, Technology 
and Public Policy. The recommen-
dations encouraged the expansion 
of cross-departmental programs 
like this. They also called for the 
University to compile a directory 
of currently offered courses in sci-
ence policy, which would foster 
better review of its effectiveness 
in training students for potential 
careers in research or policy.

Whether through undergradu-

ate curriculum or internships, 
John Holdren, director of the 
White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, said scientists 
should spend as much as 10 per-
cent of their time working on poli-
cy issues related to their research.

Given that many grants from 

federal agencies, such as the 
National Science Foundation and 
National Institutes of Health, are 
funded through taxpayer dollars, 
many presenters said it is impor-
tant for the public to understand 
the importance of continued 
investment in the sciences.

Holdren said scientists, engi-

neers and mathematicians need 
to concern themselves with how 
the public receives research and 
how it is implemented in the pub-
lic sphere. He added that the sci-
entific community should also 
encourage young members who 
may wish to pursue policy profes-
sions full time.

“Obviously some will, at some 

point in their careers, engage with 
these issues full time,” Holdren 
said. “I think it is appropriate to 
train some people to do so early in 
their careers.”

A key dividing issue during the 

first day of discussion was how 
to implement such policy expe-
riences in science curriculums. 
Some experts, such as former U.S. 
Rep. Rush Holt, promoted the use 
of fellowships to allow scientists 
to gain exposure in federal offic-
es. Holt, who is currently chief 
executive officer of the American 
Association for the Advancement 
of Science, discussed his experi-
ence as a congressional intern and 
highlighted the role of current 
AAAS fellowships, which place 
young scientists in congressional 
and department offices in Wash-
ington, D.C. each year.

James Jackson, director of 

the Institute for Social Research, 
acknowledged that policy intern-
ships might not be suitable for 
every scientist, but said it was 

important to provide opportuni-
ties for students who might be 
interested.

Other 
panelists 
considered 

more formalized methods of 
integrating policy into science 
curriculums. Tobin Smith, vice 
president for policy at the Asso-
ciation of American Universities, 
suggested involving students in 
science policy and history courses 
early in their academic career, 
along with experiential learning 
courses and internships. He added 
that it is concerning that many 
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents working in laboratories have 
little to no idea as to the source of 
their funding.

Physics Prof. Homer Neal, who 

currently conducts research at the 
European Laboratory for Particle 
Physics, also known as CERN, 
expressed a similar sentiment. 
He noted that the College of Engi-
neering allows certain science 
policy courses to count toward 
optional 
distribution 
require-

ments in some programs, but that 
LSA does not.

Rackham graduate students 

Kim Daley and Rachel Merzel 
said they believe that integrating 
policy courses would make sense 
either later in undergraduate 
coursework or early in graduate 
coursework.

Merzel referred to current 

funding methods in science as 
a “black box” — rarely do young 
scientists fully understand what 
happens to research grants after 
they are submitted to a federal 
agency for review. Because they 
rarely receive formal education to 
apply for grants, most researchers 
face a steep learning curve when 
attempting to do so in their pro-
fessional careers. The pair agreed 
that formalized courses could 
overcome some of these obstacles.

Beyond policy decisions, sev-

eral presenters discussed the need 
for improved STEM education and 
teacher certification courses. Ball 
said the current system of produc-
ing STEM teachers — a system 
that primarily involves students 
graduating from four-year insti-
tutions like the University before 
starting a teaching career — do 
not prepare graduates for the true 
challenges of teaching, such as 
understanding different learning 
styles and encouraging student to 
pursue a variety of fields.

“The most important job that 

we ask any adult in our society to 
do — the cultivation of the next 
generation of thinkers, doers, 
problem solvers — we really leave 
largely to chance,” Ball said. “It’s 
a problem that’s squarely in the 
responsibility of universities, and 
yet we fail often on university 
campuses to understand our role 
in that.”

Communication

In 
addition 
to 
education, 

improving scientific communica-
tion was another widely identi-
fied area of concern among many 
presenters. 
Recommendations 

in this area included providing 
training resources to faculty in 
media communications, hosting 
regular meetings of science policy 
experts on campus and encourag-
ing engagement with government 
officials.

As scientific research struggles 

under the weight of sequestra-
tion — blanket cuts to government 
spending that have reduced scien-
tific research significantly since 
2013 — and other political pres-
sures, there is a need for the com-
munity to develop effective means 
of communicating research to the 
public and Congress, said France 
Cordova, director of the National 
Science Foundation.

Cordova said some research — 

specifically, she referenced a now 
infamous video of a shrimp run-
ning on a treadmill — can receive 

criticism from the public as a 
frivolous use of taxpayer money. 
However, as was the case with the 
aforementioned video, she said 
there is almost always a serious 
scientific purpose for such studies 
that, if effectively communicated 
to the public, encourages support 
for such research.

Cordova added that the key 

is not creating communications 
experts within science, but rather 
convincing scientists to engage in 
heartfelt conversations with polit-
ical leaders. In research, where 
emotional attachment to a subject 
is often discouraged, Cordova said 
it is important that scientists are 
able to communicate the personal 
importance of their own research 
to earn the public’s trust.

“When you speak from your 

passions, when you have some-
thing to say, when you have a 
good knowledge of and you’re 
truly interested in the person that 
you’re talking with and want to 
hear what they say, you are a com-
municator,” Cordova said. “I just 
don’t want anyone in this audi-
ence — and especially our young 
people — to sell themselves short 
because they haven’t taken some 
public speaking class.”

“If you take the effort to share 

what you care about, you can just 
make a tremendous difference,” 
she added.

In addition to communicating 

with Congress, presenters dis-
cussed the various ways that sci-
entists could make their research 
more available to the public. 
Chemical 
Engineering 
Prof. 

Sharon Glotzer referred to the 
research being conducted in cer-
tain departments at the University 
as one of the best-kept secrets in 
science.

The presenters recommended 

the University provide resources 
and workshops that teach faculty 
how to better engage with media, 
acknowledging how such com-
munication is often different from 
what a researcher might encoun-
ter when speaking with students 
or government officials.

Value

Another discussion held among 

the presenters regarded the value 
of public research universities 
to local and national communi-
ties. Traditionally universities are 
the harbingers of cutting-edge 
research and academia, but it 
appears the fundamental driving 
forces could be changing to reflect 
the changing needs of the country.

President 
Emeritus 
James 

Duderstadt highlighted the three 
main competencies of the mod-
ern research university: provid-
ing learning communities for 
students, promoting access to a 
broad scope of knowledge and 
verifying truth in sciences. While 
some of these roles have shifted in 
response to the rapid expansion of 
easily accessible online resources, 
the presenters contended that 
there is still a major role for uni-
versities in serving the public 
good.

Moving forward, universities 

will likely need to adapt to the 
changing landscape of public sup-
port for research. This could, in 
part, involve a reevaluation of how 
universities value different forms 
of research, — potentially placing 
more credibility on entrepreneur-
ship and translational research, in 
addition to traditional research, as 
a path toward tenure.

Engineering Dean David Mun-

son said his college has already 
started considering other aspects 
of impact that contribute to pro-
moting learning goals. In particu-
lar, he noted that when requesting 
letters of recommendation for 
tenure appointments, the college 
uniquely asks about a professor’s 
contributions to entrepreneur-
ship, along with standard mea-

sures of evaluation.

More broadly, the symposium 

drew attention to one major diver-
gence in academia: professors are 
best suited to engage on complex 
social and policy issues, yet engag-
ing with the public does not usually 
gain them the same level of recog-
nition in their professional careers.

Jackson, director of the ISR, 

contended that science rarely 
rewards the best and brightest for 
taking interest in policy efforts. He 
said this perceived disinterest can 
color the entire scientific commu-
nity when it comes to engaging the 
public.

“For a lot of our colleagues 

and for a lot of students, there is 
often something unseemly about 
involvement with regards to public 
policy and I think that we have a 

responsibility,” Jackson said.

One recommendation was for 

faculty to be asked to include 
engagement and outreach efforts 
in their annual report to deans and 
the provost, thus encouraging it as 
a means of career advancement. 
Another called for the University to 
better promote itself in Congress, 
the White House and Lansing in an 
effort to provide students the best 
possible chances of being selected 
for one of the highly competitive 
internships or fellowship that offer 
access to policymakers.

But value doesn’t just rest in 

public perception, but student per-
ception as well.

As the symposium was drawing 

to a close, Space Science Prof. Len-
nard Fisk raised one last concern 
over challenges facing scientific 

research. While students are some-
times despondent over the inherent 
struggles of becoming a scientist, 
Fisk said it was important to keep 
in mind the public arena that they 
will eventually enter — the prob-
lems they face now only prepare 
them for the problems they might 
face later.

Neuroscience Prof. Huda Akil 

agreed with the sentiment, but said 
she still works to encourage stu-
dents to pursue scientific careers. 
As she struggles with the pains of 
funding concerns and contentious 
policy, she said it’s important to 
remain optimistic and demonstrate 
to students that there are still great 
opportunities.

“The best antidote for the 

despair is for them to understand 
why I love what I do,” Akil said. 

his recount of the history behind 
the conflict.

Lieberman said the resolution 

rested on untenable premises 
and the resolution assumes that 
Palestinians are solely innocent 
victims 
without 
responsibility 

for their own conditions. He also 
gave examples of conflicts in other 
nations such as Syria, Russia and 
India as issues that should be given 
greater attention.

“Israel has offered to recognize 

Arab 
sovereignty 
on 
five 

occasions,” Lieberman said. “If any 
of those offers had been accepted, 
there would be no refugees.

Lieberman did not directly 

speak against divestment last 
year, 
though 
in 
response 
a 

CSG 
representative’s 
question, 

Lieberman did say the resolution 
would 
have 
furthered 
the 

larger Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions campaign against Israel.

During 
the 
Community 

Concerns portion of the meeting, 
speakers were heard in random 
order. The speakers included 
students both for and against the 

resolution.

Community Concerns lasted 

90 minutes instead of the usual 30 
minutes due to CSG voting twice 
to extend the time limit.

Speakers 
in 
favor 
of 
the 

resolution spoke about how they 
believe there is consensus that 
human rights are a universal right. 
They also emphasized that the 
resolution did not call for CSG to 
make a decision on divestment, 
but rather to support a University 
committee 
investigating 
the 

University’s investments.

Speakers against the resolution 

discussed 
the 
perceived 
lack 

of consensus on campus on the 
alleged violations. They also spoke 
about the issue being a divisive 
subject on campus. Speakers urged 
students to focus on dialogue 
between groups instead.

During 
the 
Executive 

Communications portion of the 
meeting, CSG President Bobby 
Dishell, a Public Policy senior, as 
well a CSG Vice President Emily 
Lustig, an LSA senior, said they 
were against the resolution.

“This resolution in no way 

embodies or is in concert with the 
University’s mission statement,” 
Dishell said.

SAFE introduced a similar 

proposal to the student assembly 
last March.

Last year, CSG initially voted to 

suspend the vote on the resolution 
indefinitely. This decision led 
to a sit-in at the CSG chambers. 
The following week former CSG 
President 
Michael 
Proppe, 
a 

current Business graduate student, 
motioned for the assembly to 
reexamine the resolution.

That year, CSG ultimately voted 

not to pass the resolution in a 25-9 
vote with five abstentions. This 
year’s resolution received six more 
votes in favor over last year.

The University has only divested 

twice in the past. In the first 
instance, the University divested 
from apartheid South Africa due 
to the “serious moral or ethical 
questions” raised by the investments 
made in South Africa at that time.

In 1999, the University divested 

from tobacco companies because 
of their distorted advertising 
and 
presentation 
of 
health 

information.

After the meeting concluded, 

members 
of 
SAFE 
gathered 

around the Cube in Regents Plaza 
and thanked the supporters before 
disbanding for the evening.

DIVEST
From Page 3A

Utah for one year, but the change 
he has been able to invoke in what 
he calls the “Post-Ellen” era, has 
been immense. When he began his 
job, he noticed there was already 
momentum to raise the standard 
for screening efficiency.

“The field wanted change, and 

I was ready to do some changing,” 
he said.

He said prior to his post, the Utah 

screening center was only open five 
days a week, delaying screening 
over the weekend and causing sick 
newborns to get sicker. Now, the 

center is open every day, allowing 
for a much smoother process.

The panelists concluded the 

panel by emphasizing that these 
newborn tests detect rare diseases 
and many pediatricians are not 
familiar with them, creating more 
room for error. Gabler said she 
had talked to parents who noticed 
abnormalities in their babies, and 
had doctors reassure them that 
everything was fine when their 
children were sick.

In addition to parents opting 

out of tests for religious reasons, 
individual states have control over 
which tests they conduct on babies, 
which can further complicate 
newborn health.

In an interview following the 

event, Gabler emphasized the 
importance of these tests and said 
patients can better advocate for 
themselves in these situations 
and demand the truth about the 
timeliness 
of 
their 
children’s 

screenings.

Public Health student Matthew 

Fillare said he found Gabler’s work 
impactful and important.

“It’s pretty cool that this is such a 

non-politicized subject as well, like 
it’s pretty easy to get people behind 
saving the lives of babies,” Fillare 
said. “It’s pretty objectively easy to 
do. Like someone said on the panel, 
sometimes journalism can have 
more of an effect than legislation.”

PC MUSIC

A photo of the lovely Academy Award-winning actress Helen Mirren ... April Fools!
PC Music is colorful, 
bizarre, kawaii pop

By DANIEL SAFFRON

For The Daily

PC Music, a mysterious, Lon-

don-based label founded by A.G. 
Cook in 2013, deviates from all 
recognizable paths. The label has 
received its fair share of encomia 
and vituperation. Easily pass-offa-
ble as innocuous consumer pop, 
the label’s self-aware, sarcastic 
affectation hints at quite the oppo-
site. Many critics have approached 
the goings-on over at PC Music 
with a high level of scrutiny, but 
it’s not a label that should be taken 
too seriously; it does better with a 
grain of salt and some chaser.

The music itself is hyper-digital, 

Kawaii-influenced synthpop with 
a heavily treble-skewed auditory 
range, high-pass filters aplenty and 
amphetaminic rhythms. The lyrics 
are peculiar, awkward and obtuse. 
Hannah Diamond’s “Every Night” 
awkwardly relates the familiar 
first moments in a romance: “I 
know you like the way that I look / 
And it looks like I like you too / You 
know I do / I like the way you like 
/ That I like how you look / And 
you like me too.” The rhythmic 
phrasing is choppy and noticeably 
quantized, but behind the heavy 
digital influence is a seductive 
candor. The vocals resembling 
Alvin and the Chipmunks are 
perhaps 
the 
most 
distinctive 

aspect of the genre. They are high-
pitched, digitally manipulated and 

Britishly accented. You either love 
it or hate it.

While the music is immedi-

ately unsettling, exposure uncov-
ers an insidious infectiousness. It 
can be likened to Crystal Palace. 
A vehicle for intoxication, it is to 
be stomached with a grimace, but 
the more you consume, the more 
powerful the effects become. 
The label’s bizarre, refined aes-
thetic sets it and its artists apart 
and makes it worth the atten-
tion it receives. To start, the art-
ists under the label bear Hello 
Kitty names like easyFun, Prin-
cess Bambi, GFOTY (Girlfriend 
of the Year) and Lipgloss Twins. 
SOPHIE, while not on the label, 
is an act often associated with it. 
The SOPHIE himself is male, but 
often has female DJs perform as 
him at his shows. Strange fashion 
taste features heavily in the per-
sona of the artists. In an interview 
with VICE, Hannah Diamond says 
she likes “all white and … veer(s) 
towards pink and black print and 
trainers,” while GFOTY likens her 
style to “a pink onesie covered in 
Swarovski crystals with loads of 
money coming out the pockets and 
Ugg boots.” It is uncertain how 
much of what GFOTY says is gen-
uine and how much she says with 
a wink. Her grandiose persona 
seems to be a loud commentary on 
female sexuality and club-culture 
customs. Listen to “Friday Night” 
and you’ll get the idea – it’s hard to 

take at face value.

The artists behind the PC label 

are easily cast off as preternaturally 
enigmatic, but attractive, human 
qualities come to light in some of 
the artists’ interviews. In a video 
on her YouTube channel, Hannah 
Diamond tells us about her music’s 
focus on failed romance. I have 
to admit, I developed something 
of a crush for Hannah Diamond 
after watching the video. Her cute, 
innocent personality is somehow 
both in keeping and incongruous 
with her focused artistic presence. 
Diamond 
studied 
fashion 

communication and styling and 
is the Diamond behind image-
making duo Diamond Wright, 
who are responsible for creating 
promotional images for many of 
the label’s artists.

The label most recently released 

a music video for effervescent “art-
ist” QT. QT, also referred to as 
drinkQT, is not a person, but rath-
er an “energy elixir,” which the 
website describes as a “5-calorie 
… drink manufactured to contrib-
ute to upward shine, vertical con-
nectivity and personal growth.” 
The music video for QT’s “Hey 
QT,” made with collaborators 
A.G. Cook and SOPHIE, dropped 
last Wednesday and is part of the 
mass-marketing ad campaign for 
the “sparkling future pop sensa-
tion.” Confused yet? You’re not the 
only one.

The video capitalizes on every-

thing that makes PC PC; its visual 
aspects are in no way an exception. 
The video takes place in a drinkQT 
“testing facility” and features 
a 
copper-haired, 
short-banged 

woman – the spokesperson/face 
behind QT. She is initially clad 
in hygienic hospital whites and 
maintains an uninvolved, laconic 
disposition as she gets ready to 
experience drinkQT. When the 
chorus drops and the elixir takes 
over, the whites are traded for a 
tight, reflectively pink dress and 
her slow movements fall to the 
wayside of digitally sped-up dance 
moves. Boy oh boy, if she doesn’t 
look like she’s having a ball, I don’t 
know who is. It must be QT’s doing, 
as we are incessantly reminded, 
she can feel QT’s “hands on (her) 
body.” The visuals do well to cap-
ture the music’s exuding pinkness 
and the artificial dance moves 
complement the pitched up vocals.

Everything about QT hints at 

its being a mockery of the heav-
ily ad-influenced pop industry. 
The whole label, which frequently 
refers to its music as pop, seems a 
sardonic caricature of the indus-
try. The “Hey QT” music video 
reminds us that pop artists them-
selves aren’t treated all too much 
differently than the latest energy 
drink and vice versa. PC Music 
is absurd and nightmarish in a 
bubble gum and candy canes type 
of way, but the label’s approach to 
music production and its heavy 
emphasis on image is not any 
stranger than the traditional pop 
approach; it only takes PC’s jarring 
music to bring it to light.

I’ve come to develop a taste 

for PC Music. It’s not musi-
cally groundbreaking, but it is 
definitely the first synth pop 
that I get down without dry 
heaves. Much has been written 
about the happenings over at 
PC Music, and it seems pretty 
universal that no one is entirely 
certain what exactly to think 
about it. I sure don’t. The two-
year-old label has yet to receive 
widespread notoriety, but as the 
fan base grows and the artists 
develop, it should be interesting 
to see what comes of this motley 
crew of London artists.

Poor performances 
and directing mar 
historical drama

By REBECCA LERNER 

Daily Arts Writer

“Serena,” 
starring 
Bradley 

Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, 
is a film Hollywood wants you 
to forget about. 
It is, on all pos-
sible levels, an 
aching 
disap-

pointment. The 
failure is the 
fault 
of 
both 

the 
lackluster 

performance 
from 
two 
of 

America’s 
most buzzed about actors and 
Oscar-winning Danish director 
Susanne Bier, who has proved 
that she can do better. Worst of 
all, “Serena” cheaply reproduces 
Ron Rash’s 2008 novel full of 
vital characters, issues that make 
an audience gasp and think and 
smash them into flat, trite ver-
sions of themselves.

The movie begins in 1929 with 

sweeping views of the North 
Carolina timber business. It is a 
place that would be lost without 
lumber tycoon George Pember-
ton (Bradley Cooper, “American 
Sniper”) and his superhero com-
plex. He must routinely save his 
men from broken equipment 
and an increasingly environ-
mentally 
conscious 
Congress 

that wants to halt his destruc-
tion of the Appalachian forests 
to create a National Park. After 
casually impregnating Rachel, 
(Ana Ularu, “A Very Unsettled 
Summer”) a local teenage girl, 
he leaves and happens to meet 
Serena (Jennifer Lawrence, “The 
Hunger Games”). She rides into 
the movie in slow motion on a 
white horse. Serena’s personal-
ity does not enter her own story 
until her future husband chases 
her on horseback and allows the 
third sentence he says to be, “I 
think we should be married.”

According to the jumbled and 

awkward sex scenes intended to 
illustrate their blossoming love, 
Serena 
accepts 
Pemberton’s 

proposal before heading back 
to 
North 
Carolina. 
George 

introduces her as his equal to 
his crew and his right-hand 
man Buchanan (David Dencik, 
“The Girl with the Dragon 
Tattoo”). At first, Serena shows 
no qualms about taking charge 
in the camp, proving herself as 
she insists on training an eagle 
to hunt the rattlesnakes that 
terrorize the men and directing 
them 
to 
more 
efficiently 

cut 
lumber. 
Serena 
quickly 

proves herself to be “the real 
pistol” that George introduced 
her as – when people in the 
camp threaten to expose the 
Pemberton’s 
shady 
financial 

records, she shows no hesitation 
about ordering the murders of 
anyone in the camp for the good 
of the company.

After a miscarriage, however, 

Serena learns she will not be 
able to bear children and angrily 
watches the way George cares 
for his and Rachel’s bastard son. 
With the help of her clairvoyant 
one-handed henchman Galloway 
(Rhys Ifans, “The Amazing Spi-
der-Man”) she determines that the 
child must be killed to save their 
marriage and the rest of the movie 

is a tangled race against insanity.

Aside from the stilted dialogue 

and the fact that the audience 
must constantly guess what quirky 
accent Bradley Cooper is going to 
try next, the film is unsatisfying 
in a far more important way. 
The women are given one or two 
personality traits without enough 
backstory to justify the emphasis 
on these traits. Lawrence seems 
afraid to play Serena to her full 
murderous glory, as the protagonist 
of Ron Rash’s novel is the coldest, 
baddest bitch around. But through 
her shift from a confident capitalist 
to a baby-crazy psycho with little 
explanation, there is an artificial 
softness added to her coldness. 
Because of the director’s fear of a 
truly inhospitable and aloof female 
character, they ruin her.

While there are gorgeous 

scenes of Czechoslovakia and 
both actors are dazzling in 
their Depression-era apparel, 
physical beauty is not enough to 
save “Serena.” The unjustified 
lunacy of the film is made even 
more unbearable by the possi-
bility of what could have been. 
Rash provided a solid novel 
with intriguing characters that 
were understandable in their 
madness, but they are carica-
tured on screen as condensed 
and dull versions of themselves. 
“Serena” deserves better.

DETROIT ARTS COLUMN

Bringing music back 

to Detroit’s kids

W

hen 11 University of 
Michigan students 
walked through the 

doors of Woodbridge Commu-
nity Center, 
a chorus of 
elementary 
schoolers 
greeted them 
with cheers, 
shouting 
“They’re 
here! They’re 
here!” as they 
ran down the 
hall.

The 
Uni-

versity 
stu-

dents are part of a club called 
Seventh Mile Music, which gives 
free after school music lessons to 
kids in Detroit’s Woodbridge and 
Brightmoor neighborhoods.

University alum Sam Saunders 

was inspired to start the club near-
ly two years ago. He grew up in a 
low-income town in West Virginia, 
and participated in a similar music 
program when he was younger. 
The program helped him realize 
his love of music, which led him to 
the University of Michigan School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance to pur-
sue a degree in piano and composi-
tion with the help of a scholarship. 
Without his music program, he 
wouldn’t be where he is today.

When Saunders came to Michi-

gan he was instantly impressed 
with the University’s resources 
and the wealth of talent in SMTD. 
He learned that the funding to 
Detroit Public Schools’ music pro-
grams had been cut, and wondered 
why one couldn’t help the other.

That’s 
when 
Seventh 
Mile 

Music was born.

“I just thought it was such a 

shame that an entire generation 

of kids in Detroit were getting no 
exposure to the arts, especially 
because African Americans have 
had such a huge impact on the 
arts, they’ve kind of cultivated our 
musical style,” Saunders said.

The student volunteers with 

Seventh Mile Music travel to 
Detroit twice a week using Uni-
versity transportation. They rent 
instruments and meet with the 
kids after they get out of school for 
their music lessons. The kids pick 
an instrument that they are inter-
ested in out of the instruments that 
the University students can teach, 
like drums, piano, guitar, banjo, 
cello, violin and more.

In a colorful classroom in the 

Woodbridge Community Center, 
LSA sophomore Michael Payne 
teaches one little girl to play 
“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” on 
the cello. Payne began teaching 
with Seventh Mile Music last year. 
He was most worried about not 
having any teaching experience, 
which ended up not being a prob-
lem at all.

“The kids are all so sweet, genu-

inely the nicest children I’ve ever 
met,” he said. “They’re so friendly 
and they’re really interested in 
learning the instruments.”

The program director and co-

founder of the Woodbridge Com-
munity Youth Center, Margaret 
Wilson, said that this program is 
filling a void that exists in Detroit 
schools.

“The children love it, they’re 

very excited about it,” Wilson said. 
“They love the opportunity to be 
able to play an instrument.”

Wilson said that parents in the 

neighborhood enjoy the program 
too, and the kids get to show their 
families what they’ve been work-
ing on at a recital that they put on 

in June.

The fledgling club is trying to 

solidify itself by creating board 
positions to help things run more 
smoothly and be more organized. 
Right now, Saunders is the glue 
that is holding the group togeth-
er — he rents the vans, rents the 
instruments, communicates with 
the community members and even 
pays out of pocket to keep things 
going.

He’s dropped over $1,000 of his 

own money to help pay for trans-
portation, or to buy kids instru-
ments that they get to keep for 
themselves so they can practice at 
home — all because the club is hav-
ing trouble securing funding, even 
from the University.

“Since we have not been able to 

acquire funding, if I stopped fund-
ing it, then it would fall apart com-
pletely,” Saunders said. “We’ve put 
in too much work to just let it go to 
waste.”

Saunders said the organization 

has applied for several University 
grants in the past, but was turned 
down from them.

“If the school were able to pro-

vide us funding, that’s just all 
that’s holding us back,” Saunders 
explained. “We have plenty of 
interest. There’s obviously a huge 
need for it in Detroit.”

Seventh Mile Music’s goal is

BOOK REVIEW

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

Ben Tripp’s “The Accidental 

Highwayman” is written “in the 
tradition of 
class 
fairy-

tale 
fanta-

sies,” but I 
would 
say 

it’s more of 
a fantasy to 
believe that 
this 
novel 

would 
be 

viewed 
in 

the 
same 

light as the fairy tales we have 
grown to love, such as “The Prin-
cess Bride.” It never makes it 
close to those stories that keep 
us engaged and excited, because 
there is a lack of depth to the char-
acters and plot. Instead, Tripp 
attempts to produce a story with 
similar elements of magic, love and 
heroic acts, but does so in a medio-
cre way, with nothing new to add. 
We know what to expect based on 
the genre and how the story is told, 
but we find little else to make a dis-
tinction between this novel, and 
anything we have read before.

Set in 18th century Britain, 

the novel follows the story of Kit 
Bristol, a servant to highwayman 
“Whistling Jack,” who is infamous 
for his gambling and unethical 
tactics. Kit serves loyally to his 
master, when one day, to his 
surprise, his master returns home 
bleeding from a fatal wound, a 
result of gunshots from those 
attempting to catch the dangerous 
highwayman. Kit’s reaction to 
the death of his master is one of 
a weak and fearful young man 
who is confused and lost, while 
attempting to plan an escape. 
Kit is on a quest, accompanied 
by his horse Midnight, to rescue 
a mysterious princess who is 
caught in an arranged marriage. 
His journey takes him through 
a magical series of events filled 
with fairies, a circus, a witch and 
numerous dangerous acts that 
call for a refreshing and heroic 
protagonist. Kit has some heroic 

qualities, so it’s fairly easy to side 
with him through his various 
trials, but overall, it’s not enough to 
add much dimension to the story 
itself, or offer anything new to a 
traditional fairy tale.

Despite 
being 
the 
novel’s 

protagonist, Kit also serves as a 
major weakness because of his 
youth. We root for him because he 
is nice, not because he does much 
to deserve our support or acts like 
a courageous hero. He regularly 
appears as the stereotypical hero 
of any good fairy tale, failing to 
add any dimension to his type. 
This lack of innovation has been 
a conscious choice meant to put 
a satirical twist on the entirety 
of the novel, but I’m not going 
to give Tripp that much credit, 
particularly while he is targeting 
a young adult audience. Young 
readers want to walk away with 
something new and exciting 
towards a genre they love, and 
I’m not certain a satire will 
accomplish that.

The relationship between Prin-

cess Morgana and Kit is enjoyable, 
but there isn’t enough interaction 
between the two characters to 
make up for what’s lacking in the 
rest of the plot. This makes it dif-
ficult to support the love between 
both characters, because readers 
cannot truly grasp the dynamic 
between the two of them. Their 
love doesn’t fully develop into 
anything that shifts or changes 
the story, though, in a fairy tale, 
that’s typically what readers 
want a love story to accomplish. 
More interaction between the 
two of them could have made up 
for weaker elements in the novel. 
However, Morgana is definitely 
a redeemable character in the 
novel — she is strong and adds 
excitement to their relationship, 
given her admirable qualities of 
strength and courage, but unfor-
tunately, 
her 
characterization 

doesn’t drastically alter the way 
the story moves.

It’s fair to say that a young adult 

novel can get away with a few 
stupid scenes or conflicts that are 
frankly just a result of misfortune. 

However, regardless of who this 
novel is directed toward, I would 
have liked more of a build up of 
conflict, where we question the 
emotions of the characters that 
we are rooting for and understand 
Kit’s relationships to those around 
him. Some secondary characters 
were occasionally dropped into 
the story, but overall added very 
little to the resolution.

Some may say this novel can 

stand alone, regardless of its 
similarities to “The Princess 
Bride,” but it can’t simply 
because there isn’t anything 
that keeps readers fully engaged 
with and dedicated to its plot 
or its characters. Tripp uses a 
dialect similar to eighteenth 
century speech, which is mixed 
with some degree of humor and 
lightness as an attempt to find 
balance. I doubt a young reader 
will finish the book and say “I 
appreciate the wit and modern 
humor woven through the old 
language in this novel.” They 
want an engaging and moving 
story and there isn’t anything 
humorous about a fairy tale that 
lacks those elements.

Critics describe this book as 

“fun,” and in some ways, there 
are fun elements to the work, 
but within that, there must be 
substance that allows for read-
ers of all ages to stay engaged 
in the story. I’m not sure this 
novel does anything close to 
that, because through moments 
of long descriptions and limited 
character growth, there isn’t 
much left to look for, and while 
looking, I doubt you’ll find any-
thing. Even if Tripp intention-
ally created a series of clichés as 
a way to exaggerate all elements 
of a fairy tale for the sake of 
humor and wit, there still needs 
to be something distinguishable 
for a young audience, consider-
ing the humor may or may not 
go over their heads.

All in all, if you are looking for 

a heart-warming fairy tale and 
find yourself reading this book, 
it’s safe to assume that decision 
was entirely accidental.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Musicians aim to 
retake streaming

Tidal is Jay Z and 
friends’ challenge 

to Spotify

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

In the early hours of March 30, 

many of the Internet’s elite artists 
went blue — turquoise to be exact. 
Beyoncé, Jay Z, Nicki Minaj and 
Rihanna were the first I noticed. 
They urged followers to change 
their profile pictures to the bright 
blue color as well. Lastly, all of 
them featured the caption “#TID-
ALforALL.”

So, what is #TIDALforALL? At 

first glance, I figured it must be a 
new charity they unanimously 
decided to support: possibly a tsu-
nami relief fund? But no, it refers to 
a newly relaunched subscription-
based music streaming service. 
Tidal, originally launched in 2014, 
was acquired by Project Panther, 
which is owned by none other than 
Jay Z.

Following the aqua profile pic-

tures, a countdown began. “Five 
more hours… are you ready?” was 
posted to Rihanna’s official Face-
book along with a video in which 
the music industry’s A-listers 
assemble around a conference 
table. Five hours later, at 5:00 p.m. 
Monday evening, a press confer-
ence appeared on Tidal.com (and 
is still available for viewing) in 
which it was revealed that Tidal 
will enter the streaming indus-
try, currently dominated by Spo-
tify and Pandora. But there’s more. 
With this crowd of artists, there 
always has to be more. While there 
is no free version, Tidal offers “the 
best High Fidelity sound quality, 
High Definition music videos and 
expertly Curated Editorial.”

Vania Schlogel, a member of the 

Tidal team, revealed that not only 

is this a new streaming service, but 
it is owned solely by artists, and 
even more importantly can also be 
taken offline.

Following her brief introduc-

tion, she invited the owners of 
Tidal to the stage: Alicia Keys, 
Arcade Fire, Beyonce, Calvin 
Harris, Chris Martin, Daft Punk, 
Jack White, Jason Aldean, J. Cole, 
Jay Z, Kanye West, Dead Mau5, 
Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna 
and Usher.

Now, that is what I call a knock-

out line-up.

Keys then took to the podium 

to expand on what Tidal is, and 
what it means for the music indus-
try — for both artists and fans. Her 
speech is filled to the brim with 
anecdotes about music. How it 
makes us feel, how it connects us. 
Not a word she said is false, but it’s 
also hard to see what exactly she is 
getting at.

The music industry is in freef-

all. Between illegal downloading, 
album leaks and streaming ser-
vices such as Spotify, which seem 
to rip off artists (ahem, T. Swift), 
it seems that these artists have 
banded together to claim what is 
theirs — music. And can we blame 
them? It is their work that we love. 
It is their passion and effort that 

we wake up to in the morning, that 
makes road trips bearable and that 
lifts us up when we feel low.

At first glance it comes off as 

a power-grab, which in the end, 
may turn out to be just that. Only 
time will tell. However, as each of 
these innovators walked up to the 
front of the stage and signed their 
declaration, it’s hard not to feel as 
though music history were being 
made in front of us.

I am very interested to see the 

experience of Tidal as compared 
to other companies that seem to fit 
the same niche. Will the quality of 
sound be noticeably better? What 
type of editorial content will be 
featured? Will it be so original that 
I need to have Tidal in my life? In 
all seriousness, I hope so.

Some will bitch about hav-

ing to pay; even more will bitch if 
their favorite artists move solely 
to Tidal, but it’s their work and 
they can do what they choose with 
is. As fans, as people, we should 
respect that. Innovation is what 
keeps the world running, and it 
certainly allows the music indus-
try to grow before our eyes every 
single day.

Tidal, you’ve certainly made a 

splash. Now, it’s time to see if you 
can truly live up to your name.

Hillary Clinton signs the Declaration of Independence ... April Fools!

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

Friends, family and esteemed 

colleagues, I have gathered you 
here today to discuss an important 
topic: ABBA.

Now before you scoff, roll your 

eyes or laugh, let me explain. I 
believe ABBA to be one of life’s 
greatest joys. In addition to being 
an excellent source of feel-good 
songs to sing in the shower, ABBA’s 
music is full of drama, humor, 
wit and heartbreak — basically 
everything good music should 
contain. A few nights ago, I was 
scrolling through Spotify in search 
of a song that would help me 
jumpstart my essay due the next 
morning when I stumbled upon 
“Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!” in the 
depths of an old playlist. This is 
what dreams are made of.

Regrettably, 
my 
first 

introduction 
to 
ABBA 
was 

through the movie “Mamma Mia.” 
I had probably heard “Dancing 
Queen” during a climatic montage 
in some movie, but this time the 
combination of Meryl Streep and 
Pierce Brosnan singing “SOS” was 
enough to send me to Google. (Yes, 

I know, I’m not proud of this part 
of the story, either.) While Pierce 
Brosnan should probably never 
sing again, I would like to thank 
him for jumpstarting my devotion 
to this Swedish pop band. Meryl 
Streep, on the other hand, is more 
than welcome to serenade me any 
day of the week.

There are iconic names in 

music that all people recognize, 
even if they have never listened to 
them before. These are the bands 
and musicians that transcend 
generations and gain the coveted 
title of “classic” (in varying 
degrees). The Beatles, Rolling 
Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Fleetwood 
Mac, ABBA — I could go on, but 
you get the point. This mishmash 
of cultures and genres has very 
little in common except for the 
fact that they are occasionally 
played on the oldies station and are 
widely regarded as timeless. While 
it’s still unclear what exactly 
allows a song or artist to cross the 
boundary from good to immortal, 
it’s clear that ABBA has it.

Let me break it down for you. 

ABBA was one of the first groups 
to emerge from a non-English-
speaking country and achieve 

success worldwide, and is one of 
the best-selling music groups of 
all time. It brought disco/pop to 
the forefront of the music industry, 
spawning several tribute bands 
and a musical, “Mamma Mia!,” 
that toured worldwide. In early 
2010, ABBA was inducted into 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
and Rolling Stone listed “Dancing 
Queen” as one of the greatest songs 
of all time in 2011.

Whether you love, hate or 

are simply indifferent towards 
ABBA, you can’t deny its impact 
on modern music or the success it 
garnered throughout its 12-year 
run. 
Despite 
my 
far-fetched 

dreams of an ABBA reunion, no 
new music would top “The Winner 
Takes It All” or “Take A Chance 
On Me” simply because the age 
of ABBA is over, even if its allure 
is eternal. I don’t want to live in 
a world where “Dancing Queen” 
doesn’t exist, and — deny it all you 
want — I don’t think you do either. 
So, ABBA, thank you for the music 
that inspired a generation.

(Just for the record, “Mamma 

Mia” is still a fantastic movie and 
anyone who says otherwise can go 
fight my 13-year-old self.)

ABBA remains one 
of life’s greatest joys

UCLA awaits Michigan in semifinal

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

As April begins and the 

collegiate year draws to a close, 
there are only eight women’s 
basketball 
teams 
in 

the 
country 

that are still 
playing.

And 
while 

it’s 
not 
one 

of 
the 
four 

battling 
for 

the 
national 

championship, 
Michigan 
is 

playing 
in 

April for the 
first 
time 
in 

program history.

Fresh 
off 
a 
69-60 
win 

over Southern Mississippi in 
Hattiesburg last Sunday, the 
Wolverines return to Crisler 
Center on Wednesday to face 
UCLA in their first WNIT 
semifinal matchup since 2010.

Just two wins away from 

hanging 
the 
first 
women’s 

basketball banner at Crisler, the 
team couldn’t be more excited to 
be back in Ann Arbor. And after 
two WNIT victories in front of 
raucous road crowds — at Toledo 
and 
Southern 
Mississippi 
— 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
wants the Wolverine faithful to 
create a similar environment.

“Any time (this season) that 

we have a had a tremendous 
crowd, a supportive crowd and 
a rowdy crowd, it has made the 
difference between winning and 
losing,” Barnes Arico told WTKA 
Radio on Tuesday. “It gets the 
team so fired up, and it really is a 
wonderful environment.”

Michigan (20-14) is hoping 

for a strong turnout Wednesday 
night, but lately, it hasn’t really 
mattered where the Wolverines 
are playing.

Despite playing two games in 

unfriendly territory, Michigan 

managed to escape with two wins 
in large part due to its seniors, who 
have been bound and determined 
to extend their careers. Led by 
senior forwards Nicole Elmblad 
and Cyesha Goree and senior 
guard Shannon Smith, Michigan 
has been playing arguably its best 
basketball of the season.

Most recently, Elmblad filled 

the stat sheet against Southern 
Mississippi with 14 points, four 
rebounds, five assists and four 
steals, all while holding leading 
scorer Tamara Jones to six 
points. Goree added 15 points and 
12 boards for her 17th double-
double of the season, and Smith 
posted 11 points of her own.

“All through this WNIT run, 

we have been led by our seniors,” 
Barnes Arico said. “They don’t 
want to stop playing. Nicole is 
playing with so much confidence 
right now — she has been a 
difference-maker for us on both 
ends of the floor.

“We have five people (scoring) 

in double figures, and that really 
makes it hard for other teams 
to defend us. A lot of times 
when (Elmblad) wasn’t scoring 
during the course of the season, 

people would step off of her and 
double Cyesha. Now that Nicole 
is knocking down that shot, it 
makes it that much tougher.”

The Wolverines will have 

to continue that momentum 
Wednesday against a team that 
barely made the tournament but 
has caught fire as of late.

The Bruins (17-18) entered the 

WNIT as the only team in the 
field with a losing record — two 
and a half games below the next-
worst team in the field — but 
they have now won four straight 
contests. They won three of 
the four by double digits, along 
with a five-point upset of NCAA 
Tournament bubble team San 
Diego (24-7).

UCLA’s offense is led by a trio 

of guards — Nirra Fields, Jordin 
Canada and Kari Korver — that, 
together, scores 30 points per 
game. The rest of the Bruins’ 
lineup has been fluid all season 
— nine other players, including 
guard Dominique Williams (twin 
sister of Michigan sophomore 
guard Danielle), have made at 
least one start and appeared in at 
least 17 games.

“UCLA is super athletic and 

really, really big,” Barnes Arico 
said. “They have probably six or 
seven players on their four-five 
rotation that they rotate in and 
out, play about 10-12 minutes a 
game, and they’re all about 6-2, 
6-3.”

As the Wolverines make their 

push to advance to their first-ever 
postseason championship game, 
they expect to lean heavily both 
on their seniors and their fans at 
Crisler Center.

And though Barnes Arico 

doesn’t know what to expect from 
the crowd Wednesday, her team 
has earned the support of the 
Michigan athletic community, 
including athletic director Jim 
Hackett and men’s basketball 
coach John Beilein, who attended 
last Thursday’s game against 
Missouri.

“(Beilein) is just the most 

supportive coach and coworker, 
and just tremendous to work 
with,” Barnes Arico said. “He 
said, ‘Kim, everyone’s going to 
be there (Wednesday). I will be 
there, (my team) will be there, 
and anything we can do to 
support you and your program, 
we will do.’ ”

Offense stays hot 
in midweek win 

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Lately, the Michigan baseball 

team has had no trouble scoring.

Tuesday was no different, 

as the Wolverines (2-4 Big Ten, 
15-12 overall) defeated Toledo 
(3-3 MAC, 9-19 overall), 7-3, for 
their third 
consecutive 
victory.

“It 
was 

great to see us come out the way 
we did in the first two innings,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 

Michigan launched its offense 

right away in the first inning. 
Junior 
third 
baseman 
Jacob 

Cronenworth led off with a solo 
home run, his third this season.

“(The home run) was a good 

tone-setter,” Bakich said. “You 
don’t see that very often.”

After freshman shortstop Jake 

Bivens flew out to center field, 
senior center fielder Jackson 
Glines drew a walk before he 
advanced to second base on a wild 
pitch. Sophomore first baseman 
Carmen Benedetti then drove 
Glines in with a double to put the 
Wolverines up 2-0.

But it was junior left fielder 

Cody Bruder who stole the show. 
He blasted a two-run homer — the 
first of his Michigan career — to 
extend the lead to 4-0. Bruder is 
now carrying a 13-game hit streak 
and a 21-game on-base streak.

“(Bruder) strings together a 

lot of quality at-bats every week,” 
Bakich said. 

After the Rockets put up a 

run in the top of the second, the 
Wolverines 
gave 
themselves 

breathing room in the bottom 
of the frame. With the bases 
loaded and one out, Glines hit 
into a fielder’s choice to drive in 
a run. Benedetti and Bruder each 
followed up by drawing walks, 

forcing in another run and putting 
Michigan ahead 6-1.

“We 
just 
kept 
throwing 

punches at them,” Bakich said.

From there, Toledo chipped 

away at Michigan’s advantage. 
With two on and two out in the 
fifth inning, right fielder Ryan 
Callahan hit an RBI single to left 
to make the score 6-2. The threat 
ended when the Wolverines’ 
starter, junior right-hander Matt 
Ogden, struck out designated 
hitter Dan Zuchowski.

But the situation only got 

more tense for Michigan in the 
sixth. The Rockets had runners 
on second and third with none 
out, prompting Bakich to pull 
Ogden in favor of sophomore right 
hander Cam Wysocki. Wysocki 
got the next two batters to ground 
out, but surrendered a run in the 
process.

Following a walk to put two on 

with two out, sophomore right-
hander Mac Lozer came on to 
relieve Wysocki. Lozer quickly 
shut down Toledo’s rally by 
striking out second baseman Matt 
Hansen.

“In that situation, we used 

three pitchers, and we needed to 
get out of that unscathed. Mac 
Lozer has thrived in that role,” 
Bakich said.

In 
the 
eighth, 
Benedetti 

was called on to pitch for the 
Wolverines. He was up to the task, 
pitching the entire inning without 
allowing a run, walking one and 
striking out one.

While Tuesday’s victory was 

not as flashy as Michigan’s 19-5 
blasting of the Rockets on March 7, 
the win improved the Wolverines’ 
already sterling all-time record 
versus Toledo to 37-13-1. Michigan 
will face another team that it 
has been historically successful 
against, Central Michigan, on 
Wednesday.

Draft results unknown

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Any assistant coach on the 

Michigan football staff will tell 
you there’s no experience quite 
like working for Jim Harbaugh.

Plenty of oddities separate 

Harbaugh from the rest — his 
expressions, his tough attitude, 
his competitive antics — but 
a notable one is that he holds 
a draft to select teams for the 
spring game.

Michigan’s 
draft, 
held 

Saturday, 
helped 
solidify 

some of the strengths and 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
team. 

While 
offensive 
coordinator 

Tim 
Drevno 
and 
defensive 

coordinator D.J. Durkin were 
hesitant to elaborate ahead of 
this Saturday’s spring game, 
they did talk about drafting a 
team for the first time since they 
last worked on Harbaugh’s staff 
at Stanford in 2010 and 2009, 
respectively.

“It’s 
great 
experience,” 

Drevno said. “It’s something 
that we’ve done in the past 
with Coach Harbaugh. You 
go through the roster, and 
you pick out your strengths 
and weaknesses, and you pick 
out 
your 
positions. 
You’re 

strategizing as the draft goes 
on because you have to fill those 
positions to make sure you 
don’t lose out on somebody. … It 
really makes you a better coach 
because you have to fill a team 
and build your strengths.”

The 
two 
wouldn’t 
give 

specifics on the players they 
picked, but Durkin said he had 
an idea of some of the top players 
on his defense are as he closes 
spring camp.

“We’ve got a much better 

sense now than a month or two 
ago,” Durkin said. “It’ll give us 
a good starting ground for (fall) 
camp. We’ll (go back) through 
it in camp. One of the best 
things in practice is to keep it 
competitive.”

Neither coordinator has been 

shy in his career about shaking 
things up and starting new, 
younger players.

Drevno 
hasn’t 
been 
an 

offensive coordinator since 2006 

at San Diego, but as the offensive 
line coach at Southern California 
last season, he started two true 
freshmen all year and a third 
late in the season because of an 
injury. This year, he has a stable 
of linemen to rotate during 
spring.

Durkin 
had 
a 
solid, 

experienced defense at Florida 
last season, but he started two 
freshmen and two sophomores 
toward the end of the 2013 
season, his first year as defensive 
coordinator for the Gators.

Durkin 
has 
most 
of 
his 

defense returning this year, but 
he gave some early names to 
look for at defensive end, where 
Michigan lost both 2014 starters, 
Frank Clark and Brennen Beyer. 
Durkin mentioned senior Chris 
Wormley, senior Royce Jenkins-
Stone, junior Maurice Hurst 
Jr. and sophomore Lawrence 
Marshall, the latter of whom has 
made tremendous strides this 
spring.

“He’s a young guy, he’s a 

freshman — first two practices, 
it looked like he could barely line 
up,” Durkin said. “Now he’s out 
there and he’s playing really well 
for us. We expect him to help 
us.”

Durkin specializes in coaching 

linebackers, who are his most 
experienced group of players.

“Joe Bolden, who’s played 

a lot of football here, he’s had 
a really good spring,” Durkin 
said. “I like his toughness. I 
like his leadership. (Desmond) 
Morgan is the same way. Those 
two are pretty much the same 
type of guy there for us.”

And 
then 
there’s 
the 

secondary, which holds the one 
true wild card: top 2014 recruit 
Jabrill Peppers, now a redshirt 
freshman.

“The 
guy 
loves 
football,” 

Durkin said. “He’s intelligent off 
the field. He’s very intelligent on 
the field as well. I’m not surprised 
at all. He works really hard at it. 
He’s got a great attitude every 
day.”

Durkin added that he’d feel 

comfortable throwing Peppers 
anywhere 
in 
the 
starting 

secondary, just as he has with 
young players in the past.

“Freshman, true freshman, 

that doesn’t matter to me,” 
Durkin said. “A guy’s either 
ready or he’s not. That’s been 
my experience and my track 
record. We’ve played a lot of 
young guys.”

Daily Sports Writer

Another 
narrative 
has 

been eclipsed by sophomore 
right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa’s 

spectacular 
pitching 

performance against Iowa. It’s 
hard to follow, but has been 
slowly developing throughout 
the season.

It’s the story of how senior 

left-hander Haylie Wagner has 
suffered a few ill-timed lapses 
and now faces the challenge 
of regaining control midway 
through a season.

Every 
athlete 
undergoes 

troubled times, and so far in 
2015, Wagner is no exception. 
But as the season has continued, 
Wagner has seen her struggles 
grow 
from 
footnotes 
in 

otherwise-respectable outings 
to a full-fledged chapter in the 
story of her season.

Wagner allowed four runs, 

had four errors and walked two 
batters in Saturday’s 7-4 win 
over Iowa. A three-run fifth 
inning for the Hawkeyes had 
the Michigan coaching staff 
visiting Wagner on the mound 
several times before she was 
finally subbed out for the final 
frames.

“I just wanted her to get 

angry,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins after Saturday’s 
games. “That other team wants 
to beat her and she needs to 
get mad at them. … I wanted a 
pitcher that was going to play to 
win.”

It got worse in Sunday’s 6-4 

loss to Iowa, when Wagner 
was brought in for Betsa to 
protect a one-run Michgan 
lead with one out and runners 
on first and second. Wagner’s 

first pitch was wild, allowing 
the runners to advance. After 
intentionally walking catcher 
Holly Hoffman, Wagner gave 
up a double, surrendering the 
Michigan lead.

“We needed Haylie to do 

her part,” Hutchins said after 
Sunday’s loss. 
“That did not 
occur, so we 
got what we 
deserved.”

Wagner, 

a 2014 All-
American, 
has amassed 
a 13-2 record 
and recorded 
two 
saves 

in 
her 
20 

appearances this year. Outings 
like her complete game, one-run 
win over then-No. 3 Alabama on 
Feb. 21 have proved she can pitch 
as well as her accomplished 
résumé suggests she can.

Yet 
the 
instances 
where 

Wagner has faltered have been 
critical.

It all started in the first game 

of the year against No. 1 Florida. 
After pitching six innings of 
two-hit softball, two walks 
followed by a fielder’s choice 
put runners on first and third 
in a tie game. With two Florida 
outs, Wagner threw a wild pitch 
that allowed the winning run 
to score. It was a microcosm 
of Wagner’s entire season. One 
bad inning undid an entire 
game of solid work.

On March 5, the Wolverines 

played the Gators again at 
the 
Judi 
Garman 
Classic, 

and Wagner hit three Florida 
batters in the third inning as 
the Gators scored three runs 
and cut into Michigan’s lead. 
In the home opener against 
Kent State, Wagner allowed 
three runs and was outdueled 
in a pitching battle by Golden 
Flashes right-hander Emma 
Johnson in an upset loss for the 
Wolverines.

“We’ve blown a lot of teams 

out,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins after the Kent State 
loss. “But to get where we want 
to go, we’ve got to be able to chip 
it out and win a tight series.”

Nobody who has watched 

the Michigan softball team 
can question the support the 

players 
and 

coaches openly 
show for one 
another. 
One 

need only look 
to the pregame 
ceremony 
of 
highly 

choreographed 
handshakes 
and 
high-

fives, or watch 
the 
throng 

of supportive teammates that 
gather outside the dugout after 
every home run or inning-
ending strikeout.

“Confidence comes around 

from the entire team,” Wagner 
said after the win against 
Bowling Green. “As long as I 
trust them and they trust me, 
we’re going to be good.”

Despite her troubles against 

elite 
competition 
early 
on, 

it seemed like Wagner was 
settling into a rhythm as she 
chalked up quality wins over 
Bowling Green, Ohio State 
and Western Michigan. But 
Wagner’s 
struggles 
against 

Iowa are a cause for renewed 
concern.

A decorated veteran, the 

senior 
left-hander 
plays 

an important role for the 
Wolverines. She still has the 
regular season to overcome this 
adversity, and she still has the 
ability to pitch at an elite level. 
But to contribute to Michigan’s 
hopes of a championship run, 
Wagner will have to right the 
ship before the problem grows 
larger.

“That other team 
wants to beat her 
and she needs to 
get mad at them.”

S

tand in the inescapable rain 
and 
question 
everything. 

Then once you’ve figured it 

out, question it again. Stop on the 
corner of Main Street and watch 
the white walking signal turn to 
red, then back again to white. Sit 
down next to a man playing the vio-
lin with a wolf mask on his face and 
listen for a few hours, because the 
city is talking to you.

Most of the time, Ann Arbor 

spins me in circles and leaves me 
dizzy, forces my eyes shut after 
long days and then somehow man-
ages to force them open again every 
morning with the eastward sun. 
Most days, the only word I want to 
use to describe Ann Arbor doesn’t 
sound flowery — Ann Arbor is not 
beautiful or alive or freeing, it’s 
lonely.

In four weeks, Ann Arbor will 

be rid of a huge percentage of stu-
dents following the end of the win-
ter term, but the 40,000 here now 
already make me feel like I’m the 
only living thing for miles. Stand-
ing on the Diag on the hour, it’s like 
everyone around me is a different 
species or worse, playing an entire-
ly different game with rules no one 
bothered to tell me.

It’s April 1 and I’m not in the jok-

ing mood. I would be overjoyed to 
write about the warm sun and how 
it feels for spring to have finally 

sprung, but it 
hasn’t. As I am 
writing this, it 
is overcast and 
the 
weather 

predicts 
ice 

showers 
and 

lows 
of 
15 

degrees for the 
coming week.

Ignore 

everything 
I’ve 
written 

so far about 
the 
hidden 

treasures Ann 
Arbor 
holds 

just 
await-

ing 
discov-

ery, 
because 

the 
seasonal 

depression 
everyone 
talks 

about is real and it hit hard on 
myself and on my peers in the past 
month as we all wait for one warm 
weekend. Ann Arbor is cold, and 
our relationship mirrors that of my 
relationship with the Ross boy who 
sleeps next to me on Friday nights 
— once a week it’s pretty great, but 
most of the time I could take it or 
leave it.

I see photos of Pasadena taken 

on my brother’s iPhone that induce 
dreams of California beaches and 
rollerblades and burgers that don’t 

taste like they’ve previously been 
frozen longer than I’ve been alive.

Ann Arbor is cold, and it will 

not be sympathetic to you. It is 
recklessly ambiguous and will be 
heartlessly honest with you when 
you are indeed wearing that mini 
skirt in the middle of January or 
you go to NYPD for a slice and the 
guy serving it to you knows you by 
name. Ann Arbor will tell you when 
you’ve got a problem and I know 
because I get told a hell of a lot by 
this city that I am in the wrong. 
That what I want is wrong or that 
I made a mistake, a quick reminder 
that my mother is 800 miles away 
and there will be no warm dinner 
waiting in the oven for me tonight 
and there will be no one to stop me 
from standing on the street looking 
like a lost puppy, watching colors 
turn until things make sense.

And then I remember that this 

is exactly what I’ve always wanted. 
The loneliness that follows the first 
few years of freedom is normal; at 
the very least we can take solace 
in knowing we are surrounded by 
seas of people who all feel alone. 
The Keds I got just three years ago 
remind me that, while Ann Arbor 
has gone around the sun time and 
time again, twenty is a new decade 
for me, so it might be alright to not 
be quite so hard on ourselves. Ann 
Arbor is the city a whole lot of peo-
ple live in alone for the first time, 
taking our proverbial virginities 
and welcoming us to reality.

It’s unbearable at times, but the 

truth is, you never forget your first.

An interview with former Congressman Rush Holt

The following is an interview with 

Rush Holt conducted during the 
Jerome B. Wiesner Symposium on 
Strengthening the Roles of Universi-
ties in National Science Policymak-
ing. Holt is currently chief executive 
officer of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science. 
Before taking over this role in Feb-
ruary, he served sixteen years in the 
U.S. House of Representatives (NJ–
12). In Congress, he was a proponent 
for the advancement of science and 
technology policies. He also held a 
faculty appointment at Swarthmore 
College as a professor of physics and 
public policy.

How do you define science?

Rush Holt: It’s a way of ask-

ing questions so that they can be 
answered empirically and verifi-
ably … You try things, you observe 
things, you communicate your 
conclusions, and you subject your 
conclusions to other people who 
will check your work. That’s sci-
ence. That’s the whole of science 
right there. It’s empirically based 
— evidence-based — it involves 
open communication and an invi-
tation to others to check your 
work. If you do all of those things 
you’re thinking like a scientist. 
And if you understand that, I think 
you begin to understand and can 
appreciate why it is important that 
you have good science involved in 
legislation and regulations, why 
it is important that you have good 
science involved in international 
problems, why it is important that 
you have good science involved 
in social and economic decision-
making.

What is the role of science and 

scientists in policymaking?

We have a problem in our soci-

ety understanding what science 
is and why science is. For starters, 
we should say that it is a liberal art. 
You want to understand science 
just as you would understand his-
tory or literature or other aspects 
of human intellectual experience 
… Science is not the exclusive path 
to knowledge — there’s poetry and 
story telling and religion — but it 
is the most reliable and it happens 
that it is also the most applicable. 
It is a way of thinking that leads 
to progress — in what most people 
would say is progress. We need a 
broader appreciation of that in soci-
ety; and the appreciation of science 
in society at large is only so-so.

There are a lot of people that 

appreciate the fruits of science — 
the ultimate applications: your 
iPhone here or something. But 
they don’t understand the scientific 
enterprise, how it works, what is 
needed to sustain it. We really need 
to develop that understanding in 
society at large; and, surprisingly, 
we need to develop that among 
scientists as well. Most scientists 
don’t think about science beyond 
the methodologies and the termi-
nologies. They’re working on their 
techniques, whether they’re on 
paper or on the computer or in the 
lab, and would be hard pressed to 
give an understandable definition 
of science — would be hard pressed 
to talk about where science fits in 
with the overall human endeavor.

How is science perceived by 

Congress and the public?

I served in the House of Repre-

sentatives. Members of Congress 
are representative of the popu-
lation at large. So when you see 
members of Congress denying evi-
dence about vaccinations, deny-
ing climate change, avoiding any 
thought about evolution, cutting 
basic research funding, they’re 
reflecting what is widespread in 
our society and in our body politic. 
It’s not as if they’re particularly ill-
informed or mendacious. They’re 
representing what people are say-
ing and thinking, and people are 
saying and thinking that the fruits 
of science are really pretty good.

Most people would say that sci-

ence is beneficial and society is 
making progress because of sci-
ence — but that number is eroding, 
so that’s a troubling sign. And fur-
thermore, they don’t quite know 
what that means, because they 
don’t have that basic appreciate of 
what and why science. They value 
the fruits of science but really 
don’t have a clue what it takes to 
sustain science and how scientists 
work … We need to communicate 
not what science says is true 
and false, but rather we need 
to communicate how science 
works and where science leads. 
And you have to do that with good 
stories. That’s how people com-
municate. All humans in modern 
history communicate with stories 
and anecdotes. That’s the way you 
learn. That’s the way you make 
decisions

How has the President played a 

role in science policy?

This president is intellectu-

ally very curious, and that says a 
lot — to me anyway. I was at the 
White House last week for the 
science fair, where he invited in a 
lot of high school and elementary 
school kids who had science proj-
ects and they all had their posters 
up. He just loved it. He said it’s his 
favorite day of the year — to inter-
act with kids who are discovering 
things. It’s fun to watch their sense 
of discovery, and he interacts with 
them a lot.

I

n 1988, the Muslim Student Association and the Palestinian 
Solidarity Committee took to the Diag to construct a 
wooden “shanty house,” a popular protest among anti-

apartheid activists of the time. The MSA and PSC were 
demonstrating in solidarity with the first Palestinian Intifada, 
painting on their shanty “STOP ISRAELI OPPRESSION.”

Angered by the demonstration, members of the right-leaning 

pro-Israel group Tagar responded in the fall with their own 
carpentry project: an Israeli school bus painted with flames 
shooting from its windows. The display was a memorial to a 
recent attack, where a mother and her three sons burned alive 
after terrorists firebombed the bus they were riding. The Tagar 
model carried the names of the four victims, as well as the 
demand “STOP ARAB TERRORISM, COME TO THE PEACE 
TABLE.”

Within hours of its construction, student complaints 

led Tagar members to reword their sign as “STOP ALL 
TERRORISM.” But it was already too late.

Outraged by the initial message, the Michigan Student 

Assembly — a predecessor to Central Student Government 
— moved to condemn Tagar, demanding an apology and 
threatening to derecognize the group. The Michigan Daily’s 
editorial page piled on, calling Tagar racist and endorsing the 
Assembly’s resolution to cut off funding.

The 1988 controversy over Diag demonstrations was one 

in a long line of battles between the University’s large Jewish 
student population and vocal left wing — battles that go back 
more than thirty years. Fights over divestment resolutions are 
just the latest manifestations of tensions that have boiled over 
into racism, anti-Semitism, and exclusionary rules on speech. 
Israel-Palestine is a polarizing topic on any campus, but this 
is exacerbated at the University of Michigan, a school equally 
known for its radical activism and vibrant Jewish community 
(two traits not mutually exclusive). Powerful pro-Israel groups 
fuel this extreme polarization, whose resulting climate has led 
students to attack each other personally, question their own 
identities, and try to overthrow the status quo.

On campus and abroad

The University first became a popular school among Jewish 

students in the 1920s, when a rising tide of anti-Semitism led 
elite schools like Harvard to begin capping the number of 
Jews they would admit. The University was one of a handful 
of schools to scoop these students up, building a long-term 
pipeline from Jewish communities across the country. During a 
tour of Michigan Hillel last month, Tilly Shames said she often 
meets Jewish students from out of state with three or even 
four generations of Wolverines in their family. Shames is the 
executive director of Michigan Hillel, which has served as the 
University’s center for Jewish life on campus since 1926.

The state of Israel was founded two decades later in 1948, but 

its inception as a major political issue for American Jews, let 
alone college students, would not come until the late sixties. In 
their book “The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy,” political 
scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt contend that a 
political connectivity to Israel is largely the result of a number of 
Arab-Israeli wars, especially the Six Day-War. From “The Road 
to Renaissance,” a history of Hillel International: “Spurred by 
pride in Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six Day-War Jewish students 
created groups that championed causes from Soviet Jewry to 
Israel, Jewish feminism to chavurot, Ethiopian Jewry to the 
environment.”

Victories led to a mixture of pride and fear among Jews 

worldwide; pride in defending Israel, but fear of future wars. By 
the 1970s, Israel had developed into a crux of Jewish cultural 
and political identity, which became a contributing factor in 
the deep relationship between America and the Jewish state. 
During the same time, college towns like Ann Arbor became 
ground zero for the New Left. The University has remained 
synonymous with radical student movements, while continuing 
to cultivate one of the largest, most vibrant Jewish communities 
of any university. The tension between these two factions would 
be palpable by the 1980s, with the 1988 Diag demonstrations 
serving just one example.

In 1989, after three Michigan Daily editorials were 

particularly harsh in their criticism of Israel and Zionism 
(“Zionism … is from its inception a racist construct” read one 

piece), hundreds of students protested outside of the Student 
Publications Building. They held signs like “Daily editorials are 
anti-Jewish” and “Print facts not slander.”

This tension between Jewish students and pro-Palestinian 

advocates on the left did not disappear, though it temporarily 
eased during the less contentious 1990s. After the failure of the 
Camp David peace talks in 2000, Palestinians launched the 
second Intifada and began calls for boycotts, divestment, and 
sanctions on Israel — BDS. In April 2002, students rallied for 
divestment from Israel at more than 30 campuses across the 
country. That same year, University students founded Students 
Allied for Freedom and Equality, or SAFE, the campus chapter 
of Students for Justice in Palestine. SAFE called for divestment 
and peacefully protested outside of a large Israel-focused 
conference at the University that year. The Daily came under 
fire again, this time erroneously publishing that SAFE incited 
riots.

In the early 2000s, many of the same narratives surrounding 

BDS were playing out across the country, leading national pro-
Israel groups to revamp their campus strategies.

As tensions rose in 2003, the American Israel Public Affairs 

Committee, or AIPAC, brought 240 students to Washington, 
D.C. for advocacy training seminars. Since at least 1980, all-
expenses paid trips, national conferences and training seminars 
have been a key tactic in AIPAC’s campus effort. Michigan 
Hillel sends a cohort of students to the annual policy conference 
every year.

In a speech at AIPAC’s 2010 conference, Leadership 

Development Director Jonathan Kessler told a crowd, “AIPAC’s 
job is to identify, engage, and educate” leaders in student 
government and political groups.

Doing this fulfills two goals for AIPAC: advancing the pro-

Israel cause in academic environments, where opinions of Israel 
are typically more critical, and befriending the students who 
are “self-selecting” to become America’s future policymakers. 
When students return to campus, they come with the tools and 
the zeal to spread the pro-Israel message and dismantle BDS 
efforts. Talking about a 2010 divestment resolution by students 
at the University of California, Berkeley, Kessler stated matter-

of-factly, “We’re going to make sure that pro-Israel students 
take over the student government and reverse the vote.”

“This is how AIPAC operates in our nation’s capital,” Kessler 

told the audience. “This is how AIPAC must operate on our 
nation’s campuses.”

This March, some 2,500 students from all fifty states attended 

AIPAC’s annual policy conference, including hundreds of 
student government presidents.

Defining “pro-Israel” at Michigan

Like AIPAC, Hillel has taken on an aggressive and often 

controversial strategy in pushing the pro-Israel message on 
campus. In 2002 Hillel International established its Center for 
Israel Affairs and co-founded the Israel on Campus Coalition; 
the latter began as a national coordinating committee and 
provides strategic consulting to improve Israel’s image on 
campus. For a short time in the mid-2000s, Hillel produced 
signs and T-shirts with the slogan “Wherever we stand, we 
stand with Israel.”

Michigan Hillel is home to seven Israel-focused student 

groups (not all political in nature) and estimates that its 
programs reach around 3,000 of Michigan’s 4,000-4,500 
Jewish undergrads. Along with being the center of Jewish 
life on 550 campuses, Hillel often speaks with the presumed 
authority of a united Jewish voice. At the University and other 
schools, Hillel International’s hard line stance on Israel can 
be deeply problematic, as it represents a large break for many 
progressive Jews.

Some of these students have found representation in J Street, 

a liberal pro-Israel group that preaches a two-state solution 
and opposes BDS. J Street has seen its presence grow both on 
campus and in Washington, acting as a foil to the increasingly 
controversial AIPAC. Last week, 1,100 students from around the 
country attended J Street’s fifth annual conference as members 
of J Street U college chapters. Speakers blasted recent remarks 
by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and after Hillel 
International President and CEO Eric Fingerhut rescinded an 
offer to speak, students walked to Hillel headquarters, posted 
sticky notes on the windows in protest, and left a box of letters 
demanding a meeting.

Despite disagreements with J Street by Hillel International, 

J Street U chapters are growing and often find a home in the 
campus Hillel. More than 40 Hillels sent groups to J Street’s 
conference, including Michigan.

“A lot of times you’ll see pro-Israel as ‘you have to love Israel 

no matter what’ and just supporting Israel blindly,” said Ari 
Schoenberg, co-chair of J Street U’s Midwest region. “Pro-
Israel is loving Israel in its best way that it can be. So that means, 

like, being critical of things that we aren’t proud of.”

Schoenberg speaks for many young Jews with a progressive 

view on Israel, whose growing numbers have led to more 
representation and power on campus than in the past. In 
February, students packed into the Michigan Union for an 
event with Ari Shavit, a columnist for the Israeli newspaper 
Haaretz, and enthusiastically applauded as he demanded a 
more progressive view on Israel.

“We need liberal Zionism again.” Shavit told the energized 

Hillel crowd. “Only that will give (young people) the energy, the 
tools, and the concepts to belong to our people.”

Hillel International has moved slightly away from its former 

slogan in allowing J Street into the fold, and its Israel Guidelines 
assert that it “welcomes a diversity of student perspectives on 
Israel.” But there are still those who feel marginalized. Hillel’s 
standards of partnership prohibit sponsoring “organizations, 
groups, or speakers” that present certain points of view. Chief 
among these disallowed perspectives are those who deny 
Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, but the list extends to 
anyone that “delegitimizes” or “demonizes” Israel or who 
supports boycott, divest, and sanctions.

In a recent Michigan Daily op-ed, a handful of Jewish 

students discussed their frustration with Hillel after the 
organization refused to sponsor a “Palestinian Solidarity” 
themed Shabbat dinner. LSA Junior Sarah Blume, a co-author 
of the op-ed, felt a clear takeaway meeting with Shames at 
Hillel: “You are a very much not invited here.”

This fall Blume co-founded, and now co-chairs, the 

University’s chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace. JVP is a 
Palestinian solidarity group for Jews and supports the BDS 
movement. Blume, a junior with a disarming smile, spoke in a 
quick, fiery passion about divestment and Hillel.

“As a Jewish organization and as Hillel as the umbrella of 

Jewish student life, one would think that we would be a part 
of Hillel, but we are not,” Blume said. “They actively disclude 
people who … disagree with the political stance on Israel.”

Asked if she considered herself pro-Israel, Blume responded, 

“I’m anti-occupation,” adding, “I don’t like the labels.”

That dislike of labels was evident as JVP’s op-ed called for 

the University to join the “Open Hillel” movement, which 
presses individual chapters and Hillel International to abandon 
the pro-Israel standards of partnership.

Along with a few other students, Blume also attended 

Open Hillel’s conference at Harvard this fall. Swarthmore 
College Hillel, after officially breaking from the international 
organization, renamed itself Kehilah, meaning “Community.”

In an e-mail, Shames, the Hillel Director, defended Hillel’s 

“broad and diverse array of programs,” writing that Israel is a 

part of Hillel’s mission.

“Our Hillel does not expect or insist that all participants 

in Hillel will pursue our Israel mission. But we expect that 
our mission will be respected just as our Hillel respects the 
diversity of views among our Hillel and campus community.”

Blume does not feel very respected.
“I don’t want to be affiliated with an organization like Hillel 

that discludes and speaks out against and … totally discourages 
and offends the voices that I support.”

LSA junior Jonathan Friedman, chair of Hillel’s Israel 

Cohort, was empathetic to Blume’s position. Though Friedman 
opposes BDS, he said he hopes students with differing views 
“have the same opportunity to express themselves.”

A major goal of Friedman’s as cohort chair is to “make the 

environment more inclusive” for students who feel unwelcome 
at Hillel — concerns he called “quite disheartening.”

Friedman, with shaggy hair, a bushy beard and dark, 

glassy eyes, speaks slowly and hesitantly, with an inflection 
of nervousness that grows when discussing more sensitive 
topics. At numerous events on Israel and BDS, he engaged with 
students across the ideological spectrum. He believes in the 
necessity of a Jewish state, but was cautious to note that he can 
only speak for himself.

“Criticism of Israel is healthy, and by no means disqualifies 

someone from being pro-Israel.”

BDS, Friedman fears, divides people and hardens them, 

pushing Israelis and Palestinians further apart.

LSA Junior Jacob Abudaram, a CSG representative and 

Friedman’s roommate, was disappointed with the 2014 
divestment debate and the current campus climate since, which 
he calls “terrible.”

“It puts everyone in a box,” Abudaram said, “I was 

immediately put in the Hillel box, the pro-Israel box, so that 
immediately excludes me from being pro-Palestine, which I 
very much identify as.”

Abudaram is Jewish and spent a gap year living in Israel 

through the program Kivunim, where he worked on grassroots, 
peace-building efforts. He spoke at length about the conflict, 
Judaism, and tensions within American Jewry. As an 
underclassman, Abudaram interned at AIPAC, worked with 
pro-Israel groups WolvPAC and Tamid, and ran for CSG — he 
had “poured his soul” into unifying work during his gap year, 
and hoped to do the same on campus.

When asked what was going through his mind during last 

year’s divestment debate, the usually well-spoken Abudaram 
struggled to articulate his feelings on the polarization and grew 
quiet.

“It was saddening for me.”

The Public Ivy: A brief history of University governance

by Claire Bryan, Senior Opinion Editor

P

ublic Ivy.”

Richard Moll, an admissions officer at Yale 

University, originated the term in his 1985 book 

titled “Public Ivies: A Guide to America’s best public 
undergraduate colleges and universities.” He noted 
eight schools that offer an Ivy League experience at a 
public school price, naming University of Michigan as 
the leader — “the prototype Public Ivy.”

History Prof. Terrance McDonald, director of Bent-

ley Historical Library, echoed this sentiment in an 
interview with the Daily. He said the term Public Ivy 
defines public universities with very high prestige that 
are on par with the Ivy League universities.

Though the term has been used in defining the Uni-

versity for the past thirty years, the University has 
experienced success since its origin in 1817 because of 
two unique factors.

Unlike many state universities, 

the University was founded at a 
request from the federal govern-
ment: specifically, a land grant from 
Congress. Congress — not the state 
— initiating the creation of the Uni-
versity suggests to some that the 
University should equally strive to 
serve all Americans, not primarily 
Michigan state citizens.

Second, because the Univer-

sity was created before the state of 
Michigan was created, the original 
1851 state constitution did some-
thing unheard of in the history of 
state universities: the constitution 
granted the University complete 
autonomy from the state legisla-
tor. That is, the governing Board of 
Regents had complete control over 
all University matters and in no way 
was controlled by state legislators.

“The constitutional autonomy is 

one of the most important features 
of the University,” said President 
Emeritus James Duderstadt, who 
served as President from 1988 to 
1996, in an interview. “It allows the 

University, its Board of Regents, and faculty to really 
think very carefully of how to build the quality of the 
institution and not be subject to the whims of today.”

Regent Kathy White (D), chair of the Board of 

Regents, said the end result of the Michigan framers 
intentions has been the creation of fifteen excellent, 
autonomous public universities.

“It is very impressive that framers of the state Con-

stitution thought carefully about higher education and 
how important autonomy is for good governance,” 
White wrote in an e-mail.

McDonald agrees that these characteristics are 

unique.

“This (autonomy) had a huge impact on the rest of 

the history of the University because it was a publicly 
run but a very self-organized institution in contrast 
with public universities elsewhere that were micro-
managed by the state legislator,” McDonald said

McDonald likens this historical independence, as 

well as religious independence — the University has 
consistently been a secular institution — as contribut-
ing factors to why the University has been so success-

ful.

Moreover, this autonomous system took the Univer-

sity out of the public realm while still provided political 
accountability, because the people of Michigan must 
vote to elect the regents.

The regents serve eight-year terms. They are not 

constantly running for re-election, which allows them 
to take a long-term view of how the University is grow-
ing.

“Having an autonomous governing board that is 

solely focused on the university allows the Regents to 
make decisions that are best for the institution over the 
long-term,” White said. “Those who seek election to the 
Board of Regents have a very deep commitment to the 
University and to the public that it serves.”

The citizens of Michigan elect regents so that citi-

zens’ voices and concerns about the University are rep-
resented.

“At the time, the public had a much more cyni-

cal view toward standard politics and government,” 
Duderstadt said. “That is one of the reasons why they 
wanted to control how regents were elected rather than 
appointed by a governor or other mechanisms.”

The University of California system — the other flag-

ship public research university comparable to the Uni-
versity of Michigan — also boasts a Board of Regents 
constitutionally autonomous from its state legislator.

After the Civil War and the passage of the Morrill 

Act — an act providing public lands to each state to 
build colleges with a focus on agriculture and mechan-
ics education — the California Assembly passed the leg-
islation creating the University of California. According 
to Duderstadt, pages from the Michigan constitution 
were inserted in this legislation, giving the University 
of California the same constitutional autonomy the 
University of Michigan has held for many years.

The UC system is different though, because Califor-

nia’s state governor appoints the regents, instead of the 
people of California electing them.

Additionally, the University of Michigan Board of 

Regents has sued the state, which has strengthened the 
true meaning of their autonomy, unlike the regents of 
the UC system.

The 2003 Supreme Court case Grutter v. Bollinger, 

concerning the use of affirmative action in college 
admissions policy, is an example of the University’s 
Board of Regents national leadership.

“The (UC system) regents’ autonomy hasn’t been 

defined through the courts in the same way the state 
of Michigan has had constitutional autonomy defined,” 
Duderstadt said.

The UC system has historically received gener-

ous funding from their state legislator, whereas in the 
Michigan state legislator higher education funding has 
not been a large priority.

Duderstadt likens this lack of state support, con-

tradictorily, to this autonomy, as well as the success of 
national research funding the University has received 
from outside donors and the state of Michigan’s eco-
nomic tragedy of 1980.

Prior to the Civil War, the University relied on the 

sale of its federal lands and student fees instead of the 
state’s resources to fund expansion. According to Dud-
erstadt, this is a continued reason that has caused the 
University to regard itself as much as a national univer-
sity as a state university.

These opposing facts — that the University must 

serve the nation but is run by leaders who capture the 
votes from citizens of Michigan only — contribute to 
issues of ownership and who exactly the University 
should be serving.

White said she believes that, in striving for excel-

lence, the University not only serves the state of Michi-
gan well but the nation and the world. She stressed 
though that the commitment made to state students is 
particularly extraordinary. An example of this is the 
University’s commitment to lower tuition for in-state 
students.

“(The election process) ensures that those who 

become stewards of the University have listened to the 
people of the state of Michigan, separately from other 
political entities in the state,” White said. “This gives 
great ownership of this institution to the people of the 
State of Michigan.”

Different University presidents have had a variety of 

ideas of what the University should be providing when 
it comes to if they are serving the state or the nation 
first.

While serving as President of the University in the 

late 1800s, President Emeritus James Angell said the 
University of Michigan’s purpose was to “provide a 
common education for the common man.”

According to Duderstadt, the fraction of students 

who come from low-income families has dropped in the 
last 10 years. In 2011, 63 percent of incoming freshmen 
reported family incomes over $100,000.

“Today, we are not providing a common education 

for the common man.” Duderstadt said. “This is in part 
because the state has abandoned its level of support for 
students based on need.”

Duderstadt says right now is a time where less than 

10 percent of support comes from the state, and this fact 
may change, therefore changing citizens sense of own-
ership.

“I think right now if you look at the quality of the 

University, our form of selecting regents seems to work 
so well,” he said. “I’ve seen both sides of it though and 
I think it depends on the time. It is my hope we can be 
much more influential in the years ahead in persuading 
the people of the state just how important it is to invest 
in higher education.”

McDonald argues that the citizens of Michigan have 

a large sense of ownership because of how expansive 
the University campus is and how far it reaches, but 
may not always be attentive to the changes the regents 
are making.

“Michigan citizens on the whole are not paying close 

attention to what is going on at the University but at the 
same time they appear confident in the University and 
are pretty proud of it,” he said. “The average attitude 
towards the University I think is quite positive.”

Despite conflicting views, because of how the Uni-

versity is defined as a state university and how the 
Board of Regents is elected by the citizens of Michigan, 
the University should be serving the people of Michi-
gan first. But because of its origins, the University has 
always done its best to go beyond the state level and 
serve the nation and the world.

Its creation from a congressional land grant and the 

Board of Regents being autonomous from the state of 
Michigan have shaped the University’s unique struc-
ture. This structure has allowed the University to think 
bigger, grow expansively and truly be distinctive in the 
higher educational world.

“The 

constitutional 

autonomy 
is one of 
the most 
important 
features 
of the 

University.”

Personal Statement: The image of a scientist

by Irene Park, Daily Staff Reporter

I 

knew what I wanted to be since I was three: a scientist. 
The thought of solving the mysteries of the universe 
was the only thing that got me excited — even more than 

Disney characters, or whatever three-year-olds were into at 
the time. For the next twenty-something years, I dedicated 
my life to science. I read Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of 
Species” as a five-year-old and I started doing experiments 
in our family house’s basement in elementary school. I also 
built my computer from scratch in high school. Oh, and if 
you were not impressed already, when I took an IQ test, I 
scored over 200.

Only none of what I just said is true. I wish they were.
If you are reading this, picture a scientist in your head. At 

least some of you pictured a person who is extremely intelli-
gent in a pristine white lab coat, wearing goggles and gloves, 
and holding a flask with mysterious, bubbling liquid in each 
hand. And of course, sporting the messy, mad scientist hair-
style and the social ineptitude too.

As a Human Genetics graduate student, I have faced sev-

eral stereotypes associated with being a scientist. In Ann 
Arbor, where students make up a good chunk of the city 
population, I fit in. But when I hang out with people who 
are mostly working, I almost feel out of place. It has become 
pretty common for people to stare at me with awe or act 
intimidated by me, though the only thing I’ve said is: “Hi. 
My name is Irene, and I’m a genetics Ph.D. student.”

Either the person’s eyes grow wide and they interject 

something like “Whoa,” and walk away, or they start com-
plimenting me on how smart I must be because I am doing 
a Ph.D. in science. Situations like these have happened so 
often that I sometimes hide my true identity and just say my 
name when I first meet people to save the trouble.

You might wonder why I feel uneasy to have people think 

I am smart. After all, isn’t that better than the other way 
around? Isn’t this a first-world problem?

Sure, I like it when people compliment on my intelligence. 

And I do prefer to have people think of me as smart than 

not. But the problem here is that most of these people have 
met me for the first time, and they are assuming something 
about me solely based on what I like or what I do. Isn’t that 
the problem with all stereotypes?

Yes, I like science. That’s why I am doing a Ph.D. that will 

take me anywhere from four to “n” years to complete. Unlike 
other advanced degrees, you graduate when your thesis 
committee, a group of four to five faculty members, agrees 
that you are ready.

And I do like to do science. But, in contrary to what most 

people think, doing science is simple problem solving, which 
sounds fancier than what it actually is. Virtually everyone 
does a bit of problem solving here and there without realiz-
ing it. People follow the steps of the scientific method all the 
time: observe, ask a question, construct a testable hypoth-
esis, test your hypothesis, analyze the results, and draw a 
conclusion. For instance:

1. Observations: I have gotten many texts from this par-

ticular guy lately. He always wants to hang out with me and 
is possibly flirting. He is single. I am single.

2. Question: Is he interested in me?
3. Hypothesis: He is interested in me.
4. Test: I will ask him in person if he is interested in me.
5. Result: He says that he is indeed interested in me.
6. Conclusion: He is interested in me.
Sounds familiar? Congratulations! You think like a sci-

entist. With simplicity and the unlikeliness of the situation 
aside (usually no one does the test in #4), you get the idea. 
We all are capable of thinking through a problem. The only 
difference is that scientists, myself included, routinely apply 
this process to scientific problems.

As a person who has been doing science for several years, 

I do not think science is as difficult as the public perceives it 
to be. Don’t get me wrong — it takes a lot of hard work, but 
some people (e.g. my parents) seem to see science as some-
thing “normal” people simply cannot understand even if 
they tried. Because of this I am troubled when people per-

ceive me as extremely smart. I immediately sense an invis-
ible barrier and people distancing themselves away from 
me, as if I am an alien doing something that is far out of their 
reach.

I see that barrier in people’s attitude toward the STEM 

subjects. Why is it that when people struggle with science 
and math it is almost readily accepted, as if doing well in 
science and math is not normal? But when people struggle 
with reading, they are treated like idiots? My high school 
required four years of English for graduation, but only 
required two years of science and math. The ability to read 
is clearly important for everyday life, but being able to think 
logically is equally as important. That is the skill you pick up 
from science and math classes.

What is so intimidating about science? Is it the jargon? At 

the end of the day, those are just words. They are just as spe-
cialized as the words that we encounter in other fields, like 
finance, history, and art.

Could it be the people? The people who have made the 

scientific discoveries that we read about in textbooks and 
newspapers are not too different from you or me. I have 
been on the other side before when I was talking to an emi-
nent, accomplished scientist who has received many awards 
and recognitions for his work. But when he started talking 
about his hobbies and what he likes to do for fun, I realized 
that he is just like the rest of us, and he became less intimi-
dating.

I am certainly not a genius who knows everything there 

is to know about science and thinks about my project all 
the time. On my off-days I like to wind down and watch 
the Food Network and try to re-create some dishes (and eat 
them), jog through the Arb when the Ann Arbor weather is 
nice for once, or waste time taking BuzzFeed quizzes. And 
I’m sure this isn’t just me.

So maybe the next time when people in lab coats intimi-

date you, you should ask them what they like to do for fun. 
Their answers just might surprise you.

The issue of funding

This ultra-polarization of campus is often blamed solely on 

BDS, but the responses rather than the act itself may be more 
culpable. Campus leaders have bemoaned the breakdown of 
dialogue and meaningful debate regarding Israel-Palestine — 
people like Friedman and Abudaram, Dishell and Blume, and 
even Tilly Shames, the Hillel director.

“Something’s gotta change,” Abudaram told me. “I don’t 

know what.”

“I think if things continue the way they are we’re just 

gonna further split our campus,” he added.

Plenty of other students — from both the campus left 

and the pro-Israel community — have similar sentiments to 
share. Younger Jews are also increasingly critical of Israel, 
with only 26 percent of 18 to 29 year olds believing the Israeli 
government is making a sincere effort for peace with the 
Palestinians, according to a recent Pew survey.

So why are things still so bad?
At the core of this constant strife is an issue that all 

institutions face, one that often leads to bad outcomes: the 
need for funding. While younger Jews are considerably 
further to the left of the ideological spectrum, their parents 
are not. Significantly more Jews aged 50 and older — 43 
percent according to the Pew survey — feel that Israel is 
making a sincere effort for peace. Older, more conservative 
Jewish Americans still control the funding, and hence the 
direction, of many powerful pro-Israel institutions.

Groups like AIPAC and Hillel have both conservative 

political views and the cash to make sure they get heard. 
AIPAC’s yearly budget is estimated to exceed $60 million, 
some of which pays for hundreds if not thousands of student 
trips to conferences and seminars. In 2013, Michigan Hillel 
had expenditures of over $2 million — $300,000 alone for 
student organizations. Hillel has many functions beyond 
Israel advocacy, but few campus organizations have that level 
of funding available.

This influence can go beyond advocacy work, often spilling 

into academia. In October 2013, the Center for the Education 
of Women withdrew a speaking invitation for Pulitzer Prize-
winning author Alice Walker. On her website, Walker wrote 
that she was disinvited due to her controversial views and 
activism surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a claim 
the CEW denied. The events’ funding, Walker withdrew, 
was compromised as donors angered with her politics had 
threatened to pull out.

Seven years earlier, in 2006, University History Professor 

Juan Cole, a prominent blogger, was being considered for a 
position at Yale University. Due to his often-harsh criticism of 
Israel, Cole’s appointment became highly politicized and was 
voted down. Rumors quickly surfaced that Yale’s appointment 
committee came under pressure from prominent pro-Israel 
donors, but Cole, who declined comment for this story, has 
downplayed the incident.

In a similar situation this past summer, the University of 

Illinois reversed an appointment for Professor Steven Salaita 
after a string of anti-Israel tweets, some of which were 
interpreted as anti-Semitic. Illinois denies that de-hiring 

Salaita, who favors BDS and spoke to SAFE this December, 
was at all influenced by donors. A trove of e-mails show 
several threats by alumni to never enroll their children or 
donate another dollar as long as Salaita teaches at Illinois.

In 2014 both UCLA’s The Daily Bruin and UC Berkeley’s 

Daily 
Californian 
released 
e-mails 
showing 
student 

government candidates soliciting funds from pro-Israel 
donor Adam Milstein. Milstein appealed to other members of 
the pro-Israel community in Los Angeles, invoking a looming 
campus divestment resolution.

Avi Oved, who now serves as the University of California’s 

student regent, thanked Milstein and promised to “make 
sure UCLA maintains its allegiance to Israel and the Jewish 
community.”

This is not to posit that wealthy donors and powerful, 

nefarious organizations are using their wealth to control 
college campuses. This line of thinking is terribly blind to a 
more nuanced and reasonable reality.

Like most pro-Israel students, Bobby Dishell did not begin 

his connection with Israel after a free trip or “brainwashing” 
by AIPAC. But he has had extensive opportunities to cultivate 
his interests that most students don’t — from a paid internship 
in Washington to AIPAC’s Saban Leadership Seminars, 
which are named for wealthy pro-Israel businessman and 
philanthropist Haim Saban. Programs like these, and the 
money behind them, do not control campus debates on Israel 
— but they do have an influence.

LSA sophomore Lindsay Hurwitz is currently a fellow 

with the Committee for Accuracy on Middle East Reporting 
in America, a right-leaning pro-Israel group. CAMERA pays 
student fellows to hold CAMERA-funded campus events 
and write op-eds with a pro-Israel spin. Hurwitz published 
articles with the Daily in November 2014 and February 2015, 
though only stipulated her fellowship in the November piece. 
Both were displayed on CAMERA’s website as an example of 
Hurwitz’s work through her fellowship.

Students who are enthusiastically pro-Israel, like Dishell 

and Hurwitz, do not hold their stance purely because they 
were enticed by donations or a paid fellowship. There are many 
students who grew up in staunchly pro-Israel environments 
and did not change their views to assimilate in college. There 
are even some students who become more Zionist in college, 
or adapt a pro-Israel stance after being exposed to the issue 
for the first time. This could be because of a panel at an AIPAC 
conference, or from a 3:00 a.m., heart-to-heart conversation 
with a new friend.

The influence of money on the Israel-Palestine debate is 

often an impossible topic to breach, even more hot button 
than the conflict itself. The concept of wealthy, manipulative, 
Jewish donors trying to control politics hits on the worst of 
anti-Semitic stereotypes, one that is both dangerous and 
untrue. The influence of money on campus politics and 
climate is a reality that must be acknowledged, even though 
it is not the sole reason behind the current feelings on Israel 
and BDS.

Alex Adler, the chair of Hillel’s student governing 

board, explained in clear terms that Hillel limits its group 
membership and events due to its mission as a long-standing 
(and private) institution — not donors. Shames said the same. 
It is possible to live in a world where money, institutional 

barriers, and genuine commitment to Israel all work in 
tandem to amplify some campus voices and stifle others.

On the other side of the debate, the once dominant and 

always vocal campus left has of late been pushed to the 
margins. Student government, once a platform for firebrand 
activists, has taken a step back and focused on athletics, 
Greek life, and day-to-day campus problems. CSG will give an 
occasional endorsement to initiatives like tuition equality or 
increased diversity, but they seldom inspire social movements 
and have set a high bar for any divestment initiative.

Likewise, The Daily’s editorial voice is far removed from 

the radical liberalism of the ’80s and ’90s. The paper has also 
turned away from opining on international conflicts to focus 
on campus issues, the city of Ann Arbor, and higher education. 
During divestment debates the last two years, The Daily has 
published numerous student op-eds, but the editorial board 
has not taken a firm stance one way or the other on BDS.

Moving forward

In the midst of this year’s divestment resolution, which 

was voted down at the March 31 CSG meeting, several pro-
Israel students formed the group Wolverines for Peace, which 
opposes BDS and has spoken out in favor of more space for 
dialogue about the conflict. Jonathan Friedman, the Israel 
cohort chair, hopes this dialogue will be purposeful and lead 
to support for people who empower positive change in the 
region.

While their goals for action have been vague, and primarily 

defensive about Israel, it would be action nonetheless — like 
supporters of divestment, many, especially progressive 
— Zionists are dissatisfied with the current stalemate. 
Predictably, however, BDS supporters are not impressed. 
On Twitter, UM Divest supporters juxtaposed the hashtag 
#WolverinesForPeace with images of Israeli oppression, 
while former SAFE co-chair and Public Health student Farah 
Erzouki condemned the group in a March 24 speech.

“They have not reached out to Palestinians on campus, 

but they want dialogue?” Erzouki asked. “They have done 
nothing to listen to the voices of Palestinians on this campus.”

Even a progressive group like J Street U is far from making 

friends with SAFE or Jewish Voice for Peace, but a number 
of campus leaders are committed to building a less divided 
community. Progressive Zionists have consistently played 
the difficult role, the child exchanging passive aggressive 
messages between her feuding siblings. After the 1988 
controversy over Tagar’s bus and the Palestinian students’ 
shanty, the Progressive Zionist Caucus placed a sign in the 
Diag painted with a dove and the slogan “TWO PEOPLES, 
TWO STATES.” Uniting the campus without taking sides is a 
goal equal parts ambitious and idealistic; as Herzl once said, 
“If you will it, it is no dream.”

But the doubts loom: Another failed peace plan; another 

grisly war in Gaza this summer; another right wing Israeli 
Prime Minister denying Palestinian statehood. In their op-ed 
this fall, the students of Jewish Voice for Peace quoted Hillel 
the Sage, asking, “If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if 
I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?”

Student activists of all shades do not have a response for 

this question, but they are frantically searching for an answer.
