Sdents head one last time

Amid rush to apply
for new funds, some
caution that shoddy
proposals could pass
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
Daily StaffReporter
After the federal stimulus plan
opened up more than $10 billion for
the National Institutes of Health to
dole out in the next two years, they
now have researchers and scien-
tists across the country lining up
for their slice of the pie.
With the April 27 stimulus dead-
line application fast approach-
ing, University Internal Medicine
Researcher Jeffrey Ruth and other
University scientists have joined in
on what has become a frantic rush
to generate preliminary data.
Amid the flood, Ruth said the
process has been very different
from the typical NIH mechanism
for Research Project Grants. Ordi-
narily, these grant applications
cover five years of study and are
around 25 pages long. By contrast,
the stimulus grants are half the
length of a traditional NIH propos-
al and span only two years for the
same amount of funding.
"You write the grant, get it in as
quick as possible and you have one
shot at it - no resubmissions," said
Ruth. "It's basically a rush to get
the money out into the economy."

The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 will pro-
vide the NIH with $10.4 billion for
the next two years, according to a
recent statement issued by Ray-
nard Kington, the acting director
at the NIH. The NIH will, in turn,
allocate funds to colleges across
the country for the coming year.
Lastyear,nearly45percentofthe
University's research expenditures
came from NIH-funded grants,
according to one press release. The
University's Medical School, which
received more than $301 million
for the 2008 fiscal year, ranked sev-
enth amongall universities ingrant
funding from the NIH.
Exact figures for the NIH allo-
cation from the stimulus package
have not yet been announced for
2009.
Ruth said the shortened time-
frames and requirement of fewer
specifications reflect the focus
of the stimulus grants in encour-
aging researchers to generate
experimental data as quickly as
possible, instead of following the
more methodical, time-intensive
traditional process.
Previously involved with study
sections for the U.S. Department of
Defense, Ruth said the pressure for
expediency in reporting data has
drawn concern in some scientific
circles.
The government has had diffi-
culty with recruiting enough spe-
cialized reviewers to accommodate
the volume of incoming grants.

About to lose their
health care, seniors
get check-ups, meds
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
Faced with the prospect of being
without health insurance coverage
in the very near future, graduating
seniors are flocking to University

Health Service to get one last free
check up.
UHS offers students currently
enrolled at the University many
free health services includingclini-
cal visits, radiology and laboratory
tests. The services are covered by a
health insurance fee that students
pay as part of tuition, according to
the UHS website. The fee also cov-
ers services for a one-to-two week
grace period following each term.
Many students are now looking

to take advantage of UHS before
they lose the free benefits.
Karen Klever, director of man-
aged health care and student insur-
ance said that, there is generally an
increase in overall routine clinical
appointments made during March
and April.
Klever added that last year there
was an increase in student traffic
during these months in different
clinics of UHS. In the pharmacy
there was a 13-percent increase,

while in the allergy clinic there
was a 29-percent increase.
UHS director Robert Winfield
said he thinks that the usual rush
before summer is due to the anxiety
some students are feeling because
they know that the services includ-
ed in their tuitions will end soon.
"March and April, specifically
April, are a very busy time at the
pharmacy," Winfield said. "People
come into health service doing

Though the number
of gifts to 'U' has held
steady, officials say
values have declined
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
Facing an economy filled with
tight wallets and the word reces-
sion in the air, many colleges across
the country are cutting back on
their fundraising and development
staffs. But in an interview yester-
day, Vice President for Develop-
ment Jerry May said the University
isn't following the trend.
May said although the current
economic picture has made it more
difficult for fundraisers, the Uni-
versity continues to make fund
development, which raises money
for the University's endowment
and special projects.
"We continue to put an emphasis
on fundraising and private support
because it means the difference
between a good university and a
great university," he said. "We're
just not letting up on our emphasis
on fundraising."
May said he feels it is important
to continue fundraising efforts
because private philanthropy helps
to increase the University's acces-
sibility and overall quality.
"Fundraising has become an

essential part of the revenue
stream of the University," he said.
"It especially adds to the quality
of the institution, and it especially
adds to the money that provides
students access to the Univer-
sity."
But May also said the economy
has made the mission of raising
money for the University obviously
more difficult.
"It's harder than it was six
months ago," he said. "Fundrais-
ing is hard to begin with, but now
that you have an economic down-
turn, you have some people that
just don't have as much money as
before."
Despite the current economic
times, May said there are still
potential donors out there.
"There are still people that
frankly have the money," he said.
"But it takes a while for people psy-
chologically to get past that sense
that they don't have as much."
May said that in general, the
number of donations to the Univer-
sity has stayed consistent, but that
the average gift amount is lower
than before.
"We've been averaging about 25
to 30 new pledges a month," May
said, noting that was a normal
amount of activity. "But the size of
the gifts have been decreasing."
This decline in giving is one of
the reasons some schools - includ-
ing the University of Washington

Carrying the torch

A common fixture at University
commencement, the University mace
has hecome a symhol of strength and
unity since its creation in 1950.
The original mace was mnade out of
the walnut staircase from University
Hall, which was torn down in order
to make room for additions to Angell
Hall, according to an article puhlished
in the University Record.
The original mace had 1S rods sym-
holizing the University's schools and
colleges. Each rod was painted the
color of its respective school and the
rods were united with maize and hlue
rihhon, according to the article.
The design for the mace was devel-
oped hy Warner G. Rice, marshal of the
faculty and Frank E. Rohhins, assistant
to the president.
Rice expressed to Rohhins that his
office lacked a symhol and together
they hegan the initial plans for the
mace, according to the article. Rice
and Rohbins used John Monteith's

Temple of Wisdom description of a
mace, which included six pillars and
a dome with the motto "Epistemia" at
its hase.
The mace was then created hy the
Plant Service carpenters and painters
under the direction of Plant Superin-
tendent Walter M. Roth. The original
mace is currently housed at the Bent-
lcy Lihrary.
But the mace huilt in 1950 isn't the
one that students see at convocations
and commencement. The current mace
is made of red oak with silver orna-
mentation, according to the article.
The mace was given hy the Senior
Board of 1968 and was used for the first
time in the i968 Spring Commence-
ment. It's just a little over two pounds
and has engravings of the names of the
University presidents, a drawing of an
open hook and scales of justice among
other engravings, according to the
article.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
GOP: Intelligence
report unfair to right
Republicans yesterday said a
Homeland Security Department
intelligence assessment unfairly
characterizes military veterans as
right-wing extremists.
House Republican leader John
Boehner described the report as
offensive and called on the agency
to apologize to veterans.
The agency's intelligence assess-
ment, sent to law enforcement
officialslastweek,warnsthatright-
wing extremists could use the bad
state of the U.S. economy and the
election of the country's first black
president to recruit members.
The assessment also said that
rturning military veterans who
have difficulties assimilating back
into their home communities could
be susceptible to extremist recruit-
ers or might engage in lone acts of
violence.
"Tocharacterizemenandwomen

Boehner, R-Ohio.
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran looks to settle
nuclear dispute
President Mahmoud Ahmadine-
jad says Iran is preparing a new
package of proposals aimed at re-
solving disputes over its nuclear
program.
He has also vowed that Iran will
not allow the U.S. and its allies to
impose their will on Tehran.
Addressing thousands of Iranian
citizens in Kerman, southeastern
Iran, Wednesday, Ahmadinejad
said Iran welcomes dialogue with
the world powers provided that it
isbased on justice and respect, sug-
gesting the West should not try to
force it to halt its uranium enrich-
ment program.
The U.S. and some of its allies
accuse Iran of seeking to build
nuclear weapons. Tehran denies
the charges, saying its nuclear pro-
gram is geared towards generating
electricity.
BOGOTA, Colombia
Most-wanted drug
lord in Colombia
caught yesterday
Colombia's most wanted drug
lord was cowering like a dog under
a palm tree when he was captured
yesterday in a jungle raid involv-
ing hundreds of police officers, the
defense minister said.
Daniel Rendon Herrera, alias
"Don Mario," was taken in shack-
les to the capital to await possible
extradition to the United States.
Rendon Herrera allegedly com-
manded hundreds of armed men
in a private militia and directed
a criminal organization that sent
hundreds of tons of cocaine to the
U.S.
PresidentAlvaroUribe described
Rendon Herrera, 43, as "one of the
most feared drug traffickers in the
world."

Rendon Herrera's organization
is responsible for 3,000 murders in
the last 18 months alone, said Gen.
Oscar Naranjo, who directs the
national police.
Police said he had offered his
assassins $1,000 for each officer
they killed, in hopes of evading
arrest.
SACRAMENTO
Sacramento tent
city begins to empty
Dozens of the people who have
been living in a homeless encamp-
ment near downtown Sacramento
folded their tents and packed
their shopping carts yesterday,
the deadline set by the city to
clear out.
Many said they did not want to
go to shelters or had heard that the
city's shelters were full.
"I don't know where I'm going,"
said Danny Valadez, 48, who lost
his job as a painter and has lived at
the so-called "tent city" with his
girlfriend for the past 13 months.
He said they didn't want to live in
shelters because there are too many
rules and they feel "a little like jail."
"Everybody's trying to find a
spot where they won't get messed
with," Valadez said.
About 50 tent and tarp camp-
sites remained at the tent city site
and an adjacent piece of vacant
land. Homeless advocates said
many people left because they
feared being arrested and planned
to come back later to retrieve their
belongings.

Private firm looks
to buy GM's Saturn

DETROIT (AP) - An Okla-
homa City private equity firm
has teamed with a group of Sat-
urn dealers in an effort to buy the
money-losing brand from General
Motors Corp.
The proposal from a group
led by Black Oak Partners LLC
is among several that GM has
received for the brand, said GM
spokesman Mike Morrissey.
"We are working with all
those groups," Morrissey said.
"It's too early to speculate as to
what the ultimate outcome is
going to be."

workers.
"I think it certainly provides
folks with another program to
earn a certificate in," she said.
Carpenter said though she
can't speak on behalf of this
specific certificate program, No
Worker Left Behind's goal is to
supply training programs for jobs
with high employment rates.
"Our whole intent is to provide
training to folks in high demand
occupations," she said. "Those
high demand occupations vary
across the state in various areas."
In a recent University press
release, officials wrote that the
depleted health care worker indus-
try provides displaced workers with
a chance to starta new career.
Dina Kurz, managing direc-
tor at the University's School of
Public Health, said she has been
contacted about the certificate
program by a number of people
who are in manufacturing - par-
ticularly in the automotive and
pharmaceutical industries who
have been working with mar-
keting and business skills - and
want change careers.
"They want to reinvent their
careers,"Kurzsaid."The No Work-
er Left Behind Act gives displaced
workers the funding to retrain in a
different area such as public health
which is a growing field."
Kurz added that the health
care field in general is also grow-

"A large percentage of the

have formal training in public
health," she said. "This program
provides each individual with
foundational knowledge and pro-
vides them graduate academic
credit as a gateway to a master's
(degree) if the individual desires
further training."
All the coursework is taught
online. Students take five courses
to receive the certificate as well as
an additional 16 graduate credits
that they can apply to a master's
degree either at the University or
another school.
Kurz said online instruction
makes it easy for students to par-
ticipate in the program.
"It gives people the flexibilityto

said. "They don't have to come to
campus to have the benefit of the
high-quality education the School
of Public Health offers."
The program has been in place
since this past fall, and Kurz said
it has a variety of students.
"We have a wide spectrum
of individuals," she said. "From
people who have just graduated
to people who have been in the
field for a number of years and
want a formal education in public
health."
Kurz added the variety of
people involved in the program
allows them to learn and support
each other as well as create dif-
ferent networks.
"It's an exciting program
because the students involved bring
a lot from their own experience and
share it with each other as well as
with the faculty," Kurz said.

President Barack Obama exits after making remarks about the tax code, yesterday at the White House.
Last year, Obamas earned
$2.M\., aided bbook sales

First couples' income
fell from $4.2 million
two years ago
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle,
millionaires from his best-selling
books, made $2.7 million last year
and paid just under one-third of their
adjusted income in federaltaxes.
While the income, mostly his,
was far more than the U.S. median
household income of about $50,000,
it was quite adecrease fromthe $4.2
million the Obamas made in 2007.
Both years, nearly all of the
earnings came from Obama's
best-selling books. "Dreams from
My Father" and "The Audacity of
Hope" - brought in about $2.5 mil-
lion in royalties last year, according
to copies of the returns released by
the White House on Wednesday,
the federal filing deadline.
Obama earned $139,204 asa Dem-

ocratic senator from Illinois last year
before leaving his seat after winning
the November election. Michelle
Obama received a salary of $62,709
from the University of Chicago Hos-
pitals, where she was an executive.
The couple's total federal tax
came to $855,323. That was 32 per-
cent of their adjusted gross income
of $2,656,902.
The Obamas overpaid by
$26,014, and elected to apply that
amount to their 2009 taxes.
The couple's federal tax deduc-
tions included about $50,000 in
home mortgage interest.
They reported contribut-
ing $172,050 to charity last year,
including $25,000 each to the
CARE international relief agency
and the United Negro College
Fund. That $172,050 represented
about 6.5 percent of the family's
adjusted gross income. That per-
centage is roughly two to three
times the national average for
household donations to charity,

according to the Center on Philan-
thropy at Indiana University.
The Obamas gave a total of
$1,400 to five churches. In contrast
to 2007, they gave nothing to the

Loaning for less
Federal government should control student financial aid
L ast week, President Barack Obama demonstrated his
commitment to providing affordable higher education to
all students. He put forth an ambitious proposal to Con-
gress that will cut funding to private lenders and redirect the
money to Pell Grants for students in need. This is a great way
to provide additional money to students who are having trouble
paying for college in the current economy. While this proposal
may leave students who rely on loans at a disadvantage, the govern-
ment could mitigate this effect by offering risk-free loans to college
students directly instead of working through private companies.
Congress should consider this solution to simultaneously offer Pell
Grants and affordable loans to students who need them.

The hypocrisy ofgay actievism

a

Both Iowa and Vermont finally
ended their discrimination
against the gay community and
legally recognized
same-sex marriag-
es this past week.
As a gay person, I
celebrated this fact :
along with the rest
of my community
throughout the
United States. I -
was excitedto hear PATRICK
such positive news ZABAWA
just as it was look-
ing like progress
toward the legal
recognition of same-sex relationships
was being reversed - the most notable
example being California's approval of
a gay marriage ban this past fall. But
a recent Washington Post article has
made me less hopeful (Faith Groups
Increasingly Lose Gay Rights Fights,
04/10/2009). It describes situations in
which groups or individuals lost law-
suits or were discriminated against
explicitly because of their anti-gay
views. And though I am gay myself,
I'm very worried about how the nation
is treating those who don't agree with
gay rights.
The Washington Post article ref-
erenced several situations in which
people were forced by to act against
their beliefs by authorities who dis-
agree with their anti-gay views. One
such case was a lawsuit in which the
California Supreme Court ruled that
a group of doctors at a private medi-
cal clinic must artificially inseminate a
lesbian who had requested they do so,
even though it's against the doctors'
religious beliefs. In a more famous
case, a lawsuit attempted to force the

online dating site eHarmony, founded
by evangelical psychologist Neil Clark
Warren, to offer online dating services
to gay couples. Warren agreed to cre-
ate a separate online dating site for
same-sex relationships as part of an
out-of-court settlement.
The gay movement has been esca-
lating such lawsuits in order to pre-
vent discrimination against them.
But this makes the gay community
just as intolerant as the anti-gay big-
ots who discriminate against them.
Those who attempt to deny gays state-
recognized marriage and its benefits
because they have personal convic-
tions against gay relationships are
certainly being oppressive in trying
to force their opinion on others. They
are so strongly opinionated that they
not only believe that gay relationships
are wrong for themselves but that
others should be forcefully prevented
from having a recognized gay rela-
tionship. Imposing their views on the
gay community through the force of
law is wrong in itself.
But, at the same time, gays hold
the opinion that their relationships
are perfectly moral, and - just like
the opinion that gay relationships are
wrong - not everyone shares their
opinion. By using the courts to make
doctors inseminate a lesbian against
their beliefs or a dating service to serve
homosexuals against its will, the gay
community is being intolerant of those
who are intolerant of them. The com-
munity is sending the message that
while it doesn't like the law being used
against them, they will use the law to
force their opponents to accept them.
That's hypocrisy.
But gay rights groups don't seem to
understand this message. The Human

Rights Campaign, an organization
working for LGBT equal rights, recent-
ly published its annual "The State of
the Workplace" report, noting that
85 percent of Fortune 500 businesses
now have discrimination protections
based on sexual orientation up from 51
percent in 2000. This statistic shows
the positive effect the gay rights move-
ment has had - these companies all
changed their policies voluntarily.
Gov't should
tolerate even the
intolerant.
Buttomyshockanddisappointment,
the same webpage that contains this
report also has a statistic that "more
than 50 major businesses support leg-
islation to protect both gender identity
and sexual orientation under federal
law." The gay rights movement is mak-
ing so much progress toward being
accepted in business, and the next step
it wants to take is toforce businesses to
accept them rather than convince them
to? This is no better than using the law
to ban gay marriage.
As states throughout the nation
continue to debate gay marriage pro-
posals, gay rights groups should be
trying to win hearts and minds, not
court rulings. We should continue
to engage people about our views on
homosexuality, not force them by law
to accept us.

Today, President Barack Obama is mov-
ing toward such a system. According to the
proposal, $94 billion will be saved over the
next 10 years by eliminating subsidized
loans from private banks and replacing
them with direct government lending. The
extra money saved from cutting the subsi-
dies to private lenders will also go to Pell
Grants. This means that the profits that
would have been collected by private lend-
ers will essentially be redirected to fund
aid programs for college students.
It's important that the federal govern-
ment takes a strong initiative to create funds
for students. This money - taken from the
profits of private loan companies - is better
spent on making higher education afford-
able for struggling students in a failing
economy. The proposal puts the focus back
on what's best for students who otherwise
wouldn't be able to afford college.
Despite these advantages, there is some
worry that students who don't qualify for
Pell Grants and instead use loans to pay for
college will lose out. For decades, private
lenders have heavily relied on up to 97 per-
cent guaranteed repayment from the gov-
ernment on these loans, accustoming them

to a risk-free process. Ending the govern-
ment subsidies could cause private lenders
to drastically raise interest rates. This could
potentially pose a problem for students who
don't qualify for grants but rely heavily on
loans, because the private lenders need to
make up for lost revenue. It could also limit
loan availability, since private lenders may
be more selective in choosing loan recipi-
ents.
The solution is to bring the federal gov-
ernment to the forefront of all student aid
programs. Instead of the government pay-
ing lenders like Citigroup, Sallie Mae or
Bank of America to loan money to students
for profit, the federal government could
take the role of a main resource for stu-
dents in need of a loan at a fixed, affordable
interest rate. Such an idea surfaced during
the Clinton days but didn't make it past
Congress. It's time to revisit this loan plan,
eliminating the middle-man and making
the loan process more affordable and reli-
able for students who will not qualify for
the increased amount of Pell Grants.
Congress should consider this plan as
the best way to provide students with the
financial aid they need for college.

Despite some progress over the
years, people still aren't recog-
nizing anal sex as a legitimate
sexual act. In Leo
Bersani's 1987 essay
"Is the Rectum a
Grave?" he thinks of
anal sex as signify-
ing two deaths. The
first is the death of
the rigid masculine
ideal. The second is
the literal, biologi-
cal death that is the ROSE
potential result of AFRIYIE
AIDS. The latter
death, he argues,
"reinforced the het-
erosexual association of anal sex with
self-annihilation."
Our view of anal sex has certainly
evolved since the '80s, and now we
know that AIDS is no longer some-
thing exclusive to the gay community.
Neither is anal sex, for that matter.
And many a sexual activity can lead to
the transmission of STIs without con-
traception.
The vision of sexual tolerance we
must adopt is one where everyday peo-
ple acknowledge differences in sex-
ual relations while promoting public
health provisions that accommodate
our sexual diversity. We need a sexu-
ally tolerant healthcare system that
accounts for the various kinds of activ-
ities that occur in our sexual lives.
And although anal sex is here to
stay, it seems that people who practice
anal sex, both occasionally or exclu-
sively do not have access to the same
kinds of care as people who practice
vaginalsex.
This is partially because men have
no national guidelines for their sexual
and reproductive health care, meaning
their care is done at the discretion of
the physician or physician's assistant.
When considering women, despite the
fact that women have considerably
more guidelines, they simply aren't
asked about their anal sex practices.
As such, regardless of gender, care for
people who practice anal sex will only
happen if a patient volunteers infor-
mation.
This is odd, considering the preva-
lence of anal sex. The latest data
released in 2002 by the National Sur-
vey of Family Growth showed that 34
percent of heterosexual men and 30
percent of heterosexual women have
had anal sex at least once.
And while all gay men do not prac-
tice anal sex, many are particularly
hampered when providers do not take
them into account. To further explore
the healthcare disparities, consider
this story. I spoke with a male LSA
senior who asked for anonymity to
protect the identity of his partner.
After developing an anal wart, it took
him four months to actually receive
adequate care. He noticed a small
bump on his rectum one night during
anal sex but thought nothing of it.
. When he and his monogamous part-

ner decided to stop using condoms, he
went to University Health Services to
get tested. He explained to a physi-
cian's assistant that he was a gay man
who was a receptive partner for anal
sex. The PA conducted a visual inspec-
tion of his penis, took a urine sample
and called him a few days later saying,
"Everything came back negative."
But soon after, the bump started to
itch, and upon a second look, his part-
ner recognized it as a wart. He drove
an hour and fifteen minutes to his fam-
ily's physician, onlyto receive no rectal
exam and a referral to a colon and rec-
tal surgeon. On his third appointment,
he received a full examination and ful-
guration - the most effective way to
treat warts so they don't return.
While the LSA student did not feel
personally mistreated by the UHS PA,
he did have this to say: "At the mini-
mum, if the PA at UHS had given my
anus a visual inspection, he may have
identified that the alleged bump was
instead a wart, a symptom of human
papillomavirus (HPV)."
UHS medical director Dr. Robert
Ernst supplements this viewpoint.
When asked about the standard test-
ing protocol for someone who was
practicing anal sex, he replied, "There
are no national health guidelines for
men, regardless of sexual orientation,
and further, there is no standard pro-
tocol for anal sex."
Anal warts are a symptom of HPV
and, as I mentioned in previous col-
umns, men can't get tested for HPV.
But there are more thorough visual
inspections available at UHS to con-
firm if one has anal warts. The main
procedure is the digital rectal exam
or an anoscopy, where the physician
inserts a small tube in order to better
visualize the anus with the naked eye.
So why didn't our anonymous man
receive this when asking for an STI
test? Dr. Ernst explained that rectal
exams "are not otherwise done unless
they are prompted by a concern or an
irregularity." The take home point is
that if you are practicing anal sex and
want a rectal examination along with
your testing, you have to ask for it.
Women aren't that much better
off. During annual Pap smears, UHS
doesn't specifically ask whether they
are engaging in anal sex. Although
there are guidelines for looking for
changes on the cervix, there are no
such guidelines for changes in the anal
area. As such, the main circumstance
under which women would be checked
for anal warts is when they are positive
for HPV, have confirmed symptoms or
cervical changes that have taken place
as a result of HPV or have volunteered
information confirming that they
practice anal sex.
It's important to note that the major
differences between the way men and
women receive sexual health care
exacerbate the situation. It's true that
women have significantly more regi-
mented sexual health care than men.
National health guidelines assert that

three years after women become sexu-
ally active or by age 21, they should be
tested annually. While socioeconomic 4
factors prevent some women from
accessing sexual health care, the insti-
tution of annual Pap smears means
that women have their risk assessed
annually and other STI testing can
take place.
Considering that there are no sex-
ual health guidelines for men, their
testing is done entirely on a voluntary
basis. It's also important to mention
thatheterosexualmen canrely ontheir
female partners' annual Pap smears to
get a rough sense of their HPV status.
This is a luxury gay men don't enjoy,
since they are usually diagnosed after
warts - or worse, cancer - appear.

will soon be attending a health forum

system here at the University. First,
in the absence of sexual health guide-
lines for heterosexual men, the Uni- 4
versity has set their own informal
guidelines to account for the male
population. In previous columns, I
have noted that UHS administrators
have recommended that heterosex-
ual men who are regularly sexually
active should get tested annually for
chlamydia, gonorrhea and HIV. As
such, the University should consult
with experts in the field of gay men's
sexual health and create guidelines
for gay men like visual inspections
of the anal area for men who are the
recipients of anal sex.
Secondly, UHS should support
student efforts to advocate for clear
national guidelines for gay men,
men in general and for non-vaginal
sex activities. More printed materi-
als should be made available in UHS
on anal sex health care. Women and
people who seek STI testing should be
asked if they are having anal sex dur-
ing their annual examinations and
provided information accordingly.

that reflect sexual tolerance and
inclusion, and I am now constructing I

MICHIGAN BRIEFS

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Granholm says
stimulus plan is
good for Michigan
Gov. Jennifer Granholm says the
Obama administration's econom-
ic recovery plan will be good for
Michigan, despite running up the
federal budget deficit.
Granholm discussed the plan's
likely effects on Michigan during
a town hall meeting Wednesday
in Traverse City. She is visiting a
number of cities to answer ques-
tions about the initiative.
The governor said about $18 bil-
lion in federal money would come
to Michigan, including $11 billion
in tax cuts and the rest in higher
spending on education, road con-
struction, law enforcement and
other areas.
She acknowledged it would
boost the national debt, but said
the top priority for now must be
stimulating the economy and put-
ting people back to work.

travel up to 110 mph
CHICAGO (AP) - Eight Mid-
western states hope to secure fed-
eral stimulus money for a network
of faster passenger trains with
Chicago as its hub - joining forces
to boost their chances of getting a
cut of $8 billion set aside for high-
speed rail.
The governors, including Illi-
nois Gov. Pat Quinn, said yesterday
they have sent a joint letter to U.S.
Department of Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood asking him
to support the initiative.
Longtime proponents of high-
speed rail welcomed the show of
unity, sayingitshould help inwhat's
sure to be stiff competition among
states for the federal stimulus dol-
lars. California and New York are
among those vying for the funds.
"Getting eight governors to
agree where to go to lunch is a
challenge, so them agreeing on pri-
ority corridors is very good news,"
said Kevin Brubaker, of the Envi-
ronmental Law & Policy Center in
Chicago. "We'll still be competing
with other states, but at least we're
competing on the same team rath-
er than against each other."
A spokesman for Missouri Gov.
Jay Nixon, who also signed the let-
ter, agreed.
"If there's a unified presenta-
tion, it will present a stronger case

for us using some of these funds,"
said Scott Holste.
The multistate appeal comes
days before the White House is
expected to release further details
about the kinds of projects that
would qualify for the billions
marked for high-speed trains.
The governors' proposal,
dubbed the Midwest Regional
Rail Initiative and first conceived
a decade ago, focuses on upgrad-
ing three existing routes by 2014
- one between Chicago and St.
Louis, another between Chicago
and Madison, Wis., via Milwaukee
and a third between Chicago and
Pontiac, Mich., through Detroit.
Improvements to tracks and
equipment on those routes should
enable trains to reach speeds of 110
miles per hour, according to the
governors' letter. Currently, the top
speed of trains on the Chicago-St.
Louis corridor is just under80 mph.
Later phases of the project
would improve other lines, includ-
ing a route between St. Louis and
Kansas City, Mo.
Neither the letter nor a state-
ment from Nixon's office specifies
how much of the $8 billion the
states want, though they do esti-
mate that the project's first and
most critical phase would cost
around $3.5 billion.
Other governors who signed the
letter are: Indiana's Mitch Daniels,
Iowa's Chet Culver, Michigan's
Jennifer Granholm, Tim Pawlenty
of Minnesota, Ted Strickland of
Ohio and Wisconsin's Jim Doyle.
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley also
signed.

Daily wire reports

automaker would
get 20% stake in
troubled Chrysler
DETROIT (AP) - With just 15
days left before the U.S. govern-
ment pulls the plug on Chrysler,
the only man who appears able to
save the struggling automaker is
casting doubt 11
on whether
a deal can be
worked out.
Fiat CEO
Sergio Mar-
chionne, in
an interview
published MARCHIONNE
Wednesday,
said the Ital-
ian automaker will walk away
from a nonbinding agreement
to take a 20 percent stake in
Chrysler and share its small car
technology unless the U.S. auto-
maker's unions agree to major
cost cuts.
A Fiat spokesman confirmed
Marchionne's statements.
Chrysler, which is living on $4

billion in loans from the U.S. gov-
ernment, has to take on a partner
and gain concessions from unions
and debtholders by April 30, or
the Obama administration will
stop lending it money. No other
suitors have emerged, and it's
likely that no bankruptcy financ-
ing will be available, so Chrysler
would have little choice but to be
auctioned off in pieces.
Marchionne's comments,
made in an interview with the
Toronto Globe and Mail, could
be designed to pressure unions
to give further concessions. The
United Auto Workers union
already has agreed to cost reduc-
tions, but the Obama adminis-
tration has said it must agree to
further cuts to make Chrysler
more competitive with foreign
automakers.
The Canadian Auto Workers
union reached a deal with Gener-
al Motors Corp., but Chrysler says
the pact doesn't go far enough,
and the company has threatened
to pul out of Canada without
further cuts from the union.
The uncertainty adds to wor-
ries for Chrysler's 54,000 employ-
ees as well as thousands more
who work for parts suppliers and

dealers across North America.
"There's definitely some worry
and concern about what's going
on," said Brett Ward, 35, a 15-year
Chrysler worker who drives a
forklift at an assembly plant in the
Detroitsuburb of Sterling Heights.
"We haven't been asked to vote on
the contract changes yet."
Ward, who is far too young
to retire, just started classes to
become a nurse in case Chrysler
goes under. His factory, which
makes the midsize Chrysler
Sebring and Dodge Avenger, is
in the third week of a four-week
shutdown due to slow sales.
No one is entirely sure just how
much the unions have to give to
satisfy the U.S. government,
which said only that unions must
make concessions that are deeper
than those the Bush administra-
tion outlined when it approved
government loans last year.
Shortly after Marchionne's
comments were published, CAW
President Ken Lewenza said the
union would return to the bar-
gaining table with Chrysler on
Monday after a two-week hiatus.
But he later said the union won't
stray from the GM deal. The UAW
declined comment.

4,000 attend Lansing Tea Party

Joe the Plumber
leads anti-tax,
anti-bailout rally
LANSING,Mich.(AP)-Cheered
along by "Joe the Plumber," 4,000
people from across Michigan pro-
tested againstfinancial bailouts and
taxes Tuesday at the state Capitol in
a mock rendition of the Boston Tea
Party revolt.
They waived signs exclaiming
"Stop the Fiscal Madness," "Read

My Lipstick! No More Bailouts"
and "The Pirates Are in D.C."
Children held banners objecting
to the rising national debt being
passed along to them.
"I'm really opposed to spending
the way out of our problem," said
Deborah Mourray, a 56-year-old
business administrator from the
Detroit suburb of Troy who partic-
ipated in her first demonstration.
Her friend Patty Fish, a49-year-
old executive recruiter from Troy,
said it was her first protest, too.
"I'm tired of sitting back and

watching this happen. I needed
to do something," said Fish, who
fears higher taxes.
President Barack Obama and
Gov. Jennifer Granholm, both
Democrats, drew the ire of many
protesters, though others vented
anger at both major political par-
ties. One sign declared "It's Tea
Time! Fire All Politicians." Others
simply carried American flags.
"How I run my home is I don't
spend more money so my situation
improves," Mourray said. "Save
and conserve."

RESEARCH
From Page 1A
This has compelled researchers like
Ruth, who is researching a potential
therapeutic solution for arthritis-
inducedinflammation,totailortheir
proposals to a broader audience.
"I don't know if the best science
is going to get funded since things
are going so quick," Ruth said. "You
may have (a reviewer) who's an
expert in science but not necessar-
HEALTH CARE
From Page 1A
physical exams for job applications,
or getting prescriptions refilled for
the next six months or a year, get-
ting birth control pills and general
female checkups."
But once students graduate, they
no longer have free access to the ser-
vices at UHS, and many health care
coverageprogramsthattheirparents
may have don't cover students once
. they graduate. As a result, 34 per-
cent of college graduates didn't have
health insurance a year after gradu-
ation, accordingto a 2006 study in a
U.S. News & World Report article.
LSA senior Tracy Lent, made one
last visit to UHS, said she is anx-
ious about a possible future without
health insurance. She added that she
is keeping her fingers crossed she
won'tget sick in the near future.
"I don't think I can afford getting
my own policy right now without

ily someone in your field."
Despite its drawbacks, Ruth
said there may be some advantag-
es to the new application process.
While the stimulus grant appli-
cations are not as rigorous as they
have been in the past, Ruth said
they may offer a testing ground
for novel ideas that may not have
had sufficient backing to receive
grant funding in the past. For new
research investigators in particular,
the stimulus plan may ultimately
provide an opportunity to establish
having a real job," she said. "Right
now, it's kind of like playing a game
of Russian roulette."
LSA senior Julie Foster, said she
headed to UHS for one final check
up because she doesn't know if she
will have health insurance during
graduate school.
"I want to make sure I am up to
date with all my prescriptions and
am healthy and am getting every-
thing checked out before summer,"
she said.
Foster added that if it turns out
she doesn't have health insurance
in graduate school, she will make
do without.
"The day I graduate is the day
my (parents') insurance coverage
ends," she said.
But LSA senior Chanel Hamilton,
who also took advantage of UHS's
services before her upcoming gradu-
ation,said she needs health insurance
to pay for her monthly treatments
and she's not sure if she'll be able to
afford it after she graduates.

themselves in the field.
At the "State of Research at the
University" discussion last week,
University Vice President for
Research Stephen Forrest com-
mented on the importance of the
boost in federal funding, despite
the nation's economic troubles.
"It's one of the ironies of our age,"
Forrestsaid."The United States seems
to be going broke, but we've never
found so much money in research."
Forrest said research funding
nationwide has been sagging for
Being without health insurance
temporarilycouldmeanthatstudents
will search for jobs with sufficient
health benefit packages, making the
job hunt even more challenging.
Winfield said with the current job
market, students willhave even more
trouble than usual finding jobs that
offer adequate health insurance.
"Thebiggestproblemis withthe job
marketas it is - my guess is that more
students will go out and get jobs that
will not have health insurance," he
said."Everybodyexpectsthatstudents
will try to get into graduate programs
because the job market is so weak
right now, but those programs gener-
ally don't have health insurance."
LSA senior Jessica Maurice also
recently went to UHS for a last min-
ute checkup. She said she is fortu-
nate that she found a jobwith health
insurance but, because she has lung
disease, is concerned about the kind
of coverage she will get.
"I need to have a low co-pay to
afford all of the medication and

more than six years with renewed
interest coming only recently with
the stimulus plan and the federal
budget outlined for the 2009 fiscal
year.
"We finally have an adminis-
tration that really gets it," he said
referring to the Obama adminis-
tration's focus on research. "They
understand, ina fundamentally dif-
ferent way than we've seen in the
last 20 or 30 years, the relationship
between innovation and economic
strength."
treatmentthatIneed,"said Maurice.
"AndIam off my parent's insurance
as soon as I leave school."
But LSA senior Mike Tikh said
though the company where he will
be working won't be providing
health insurance he has a noncha-
lant attitude about the situation.
"At first, I guess I will have to go
without it for a little bit. And hope-
fully when I start earning enough,
I'll try and try to buy health insur-
ance privately," he said.
Tikh added that during his time
at the University, he has rarely used
his UHS benefits.
"I haven't really been using it
all that much the past few years -
I haven't had physicals," he said.
"It's more of a convenience know-
ing that it's there."
Though some students might rush
in for checkups and physicals before
their times at the Universityend, stu-
dents who purchased health insur-
ance through the University are still
covered through August, Klever said.

FUNDRAISING
From Page 1A
and Oklahoma State University
- are reducing their fundrais-
ing staffs. Other schools - like
the University of California at
Los Angeles and the University of
Michigan - have continued to fill
vacant positions in their develop-
ment offices.
The University is not cut-
ting back on its development
staff, even though its operations
are already considerably larger
than other peer institutions,
like UCLA. The Chronicle of
Higher Education reported that
UCLA employs 270 development
staffers, while the University of
Michigan has approximately 480
staffers.
May said the larger operation
at the University can't be attrib-
uted to one factor, but that there
are several contributing causes
- including the University's
extremely large alumni base of
approximately 475,000 people.
May explained that paired
with the sheer size of the alum-
ni base, is the fact that they are
spread throughout the country -
requiring a national fund devel-
opment strategy. On the other
hand, May said UCLA's alumni
are more heavily concentrated in
California - meaning their fund
development office doesn't have
to reach out to as many alumni
or travel across the country as

often.
"Forty percent of our alumni
live outside the state of Michi-
gan ... but they give about 60
percent of the money," May said.
"We have to go a lot of places to
bring out alumni to the Univer-
sity."
Additionally, May said the
University's fundraising opera-
tions are so large because they
support the Athletic Department,
the Flint and Dearborn campuses
and the Museum of Art, in addi-
tion to each of the University's
schools and other University
entities.
The University finished its
national record-breaking Michi-
gan Difference Campaign in
December. The capital campaign
raised about $3.2billion,breaking
the previous record for a public
institution fundraising campaign
set by UCLA in2006.
May said another capital cam-
paign would be implemented
in the future, but that until the
economy improves, the Develop-
ment Office will focus on improv-
ing internal operations and
thanking donors who gave in the
last campaign.
"We sort of call this year the
year of the big thank you," he
said. "It's just too soon to tell, but
we'll (start another campaign)
as soon as the United States
and everybody starts feeling a
bit more optimistic about their
finances and the condition of the
economy."

BIOENERGY
From Page lA
of developing a biomass harvester
thatwill efficientlyconvertbiomass
into biofuels.
The objective of the biomass
harvester is to affordably provide
farmers with a tool to efficiently
process waste into biofuel. It does
this through a thermochemical
decomposition process and by
effectively controlling heat losses
during the process.
Funding for the project stands
currently at $50,000 per year, but
officials at the institute are hoping
to increase funding to $200,000
per year.
Students at the University and
around the state are also working
to develop biofuel technology.
Algal Scientific Corporation,
which is made up of students from
the University of Michigan and
Michigan State University, devel-
oped a wastewater treatment sys-
tem that grows algae in order to
simultaneously treat wastewater
and produce the raw materials for
biofuel.
The team won the inaugural
Clean Energy Prize on March 20
in a competition sponsored by DTE

Energy, the University, the Masco
Corporation Foundation and The
Kresge Foundation that awards
entrepreneurship in the develop-
ment of clean energy technology.
Team Algal Scientific Corp. took
the top prize of $65,000.
Paul Kirsch, program man-
ager of the Zell Lurie Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies at the Ross
School of Business, said the insti-
tute helps to develop more clean
energy sources by supporting many
student groups like Algal Scientific.
"ZLI does not provide directsup-
port for outside firms," Kirsch said.
"We have provided a tremendous
amount of coaching and funding
for some student-based teams like
Algal Scientific that won the Clean
Energy Prize."
According to Algal Scientific's
website, the technology is used to
"design, build and sell treatment
systems incorporating - factory
assembled modules, then operate
them for fees based on pollutant
reduction."
Team member Robert Levine,
a Chemical Engineering Ph.D stu-
dent, said biofuels, although biofu-
els are important to the company,
they're really justbyproducts of the
team's project. The main purpose
of Algal Scientific is to serve as a

wastewater treatment company.
"Algal Scientific Corp. didn't
choose to use biofuels or not," he
said. "Rather, we're treating waste-
water while producing a biofuel:
Our unique system allows us to
grow algae on wastewater which
are then converted into a liquid
transportation fuel like ethanol."
Levine added that there is still
much progress to be made in order
for biofuels to become a feasible
alternative for traditional energy
sources because manybiofuels cur-
rently lead to increased greenhouse
gas emissions.
"We need a replacement for liquid
fuels that is not derived from food
crops and does not require arable
land or freshwater to be produced,"
hesaid. "Ifwecandothiswithalgae,
we might have a shot at cutting our
dependence on petroleum, but it is
still going to take time."
Levine said the University has
been very receptive to alternative
energy ventures like Algal Scien-
tific.
"In general, the University is
working hard to connect engineers
to the Business School, and the
various opportunities that exist for
moving technology from the labo-
ratory and into the real world," he
said.

Michigan shoots for the Super Six

By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan assistant men's gym-
nastics coach Derek Croad has
coined a new catchphrase for the
No. 4 Michigan men's gymnastics
team in the postseason.
Get in the CAR.
The letters of "CAR" represent
the Wolverines' new attitude that
helped lead them
to their first Big NCAA
Ten title since
2000: Confi- Champion-
dent. Aggressive.
Relaxed.
This afternoon, When:1 P.M.
the Wolverines Where:
will see if"getting Minnesota
in the CAR"works Sports Pavilion
at the NCAA Live Blog:
Championships in thegame.
the University of blogs.michi-
Minnesota Sports gandaily.com
Pavilion.
"This is what
guys work for throughout the whole
summer, the whole season, for this
one time," Michigan assistant coach
Scott Vetere said. "You get to these
meets and you put a little added pres-
sure on yourself. It shows - whether
you're going in last place or going in
first place -it's about handling situa-
tions thatnyou're not accustomed to."

The new outlook has paid huge
dividends for gymnasts like sopho-
more Chris Cameron, who finished
second in the Big Ten all-around
and floor-exercise competitions.
Cameron's energetic performances
at the Big Ten Championships and
Michigan's huge victory in Colum-
bus pushed him to a No. 3 rank-
ing in the country on the pommel
horse and a No. 4 ranking in the all-
around.
Last Monday, Michigan coach
Kurt Golder posed an interesting
questiontohisteam. Could the Wol-
verines handle being in first place?
The Wolverines didn't seem
entirely ready to take first place at
Big Tens. After building a comfort-
able lead in the first four events,
Michigan tightened up in the final
two rotations, almost letting the
title slip away.
"We've never really experienced
(a lead like that) before," senior
Ralph Rosso said. "I think if that
does occur (again), we'll be ready for
it. But no matter what, if you hear
those announcements, you have
to learn to keep your focus, ignore
it and just keep doing what you've
been doing throughout the whole
competition."
Today, Michigan's task is simple:
qualify forteam finals, known as the
Super Six. The top three teams from

on Thursday at 1 p.m., but on Friday
night, with host Minnesota possibly
in the team finals, the arena will
likelybe packed.
Michigan's seniors and juniors,
who competed twice at Minnesota
in 2007, remember well how dif-
ficult it can be to compete at the
Sports Pavilion.
"I hate Minnesota," said senior
Joe Catrambone, who claimed the
Big Ten high-bar championship. "I
personally had terrible meets every
time I (went) there. I think this is
going to be the toughest (NCAAs)
we've everbeen to, in the qualifying
and Super Six."
Defending champion No. 2 Okla-
homa and co-Big Ten champion No.
3 Illinois are near-locks to make
Super Six from the second session.
Even against the most talented
field they've ever faced, the Wol-
verines feel they are ready to turn
heads at NCAAs.
"As long as we hit our routines
and do our thing, that's all we can
really ask for," said sophomore
Thomas Kelley, the Big Ten all-
around championand No.1 high-bar
competitor in the nation. "We're the
underdogs - it's been said before by
my teammates. By the same token,
we're a talented team, and we can
make some noise at NCAA Champi-
onships."

Sophomore Thomas Kelley earned the Big Ten Gymnast of the Year award after winning the All-Around conference title.

each of today's two six-team quali-
fying sessions advance to the Super
Six on Friday night.
Michigan will face two top-five
teams in Stanford and California,
who are likely to advance. No. 8
Penn State might make a push, but
two of the Nittany Lions' key com-
petitors are injured, one out for the
season. l
The Wolverines were pleased to

draw the afternoon session - they
have an excellent shot at making
team finals and will have several
more hours of rest before the Super
Six competition than the teams
competing in the evening session.
And they'll get parallel bars -
their weakest event at Big Tens -
out of the way first, finishing the
session on vault.
"If you look at all the NCAA

champions the past three years I've
been here, they've ended on vault or
rings," said senior co-captain Phil
Goldberg, who won the Big Ten still
rings title. "Usually rings and vault
are high scorers in big meets."
If it makes the Super Six, though,
Michigan expects a dogfight in the
intense, hostile atmosphere of the
Sports Pavilion. A big crowd proba-
bly won't turn out for a competition


Wolverines split doubleheader in
the battle for Washtenaw County

I
I

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
After the first game of yes-
terday's doubleheader against
Eastern Michigan, Michigan
baseball coach Rich Maloney was
optimistic.
Sophomore centerfielder
Ryan LaMarre had just made a
spectacular diving catch to rob
the
Eagles of EASTERN MICH. 11
a scoring MICHIGAN 5
chance
in the EASTERN MICH. 2
sixth MICHIGAN 4
inning.
Junior first baseman Mike
Dufek smashed a two-run
home run so deep that it hit the
Indoor Track and Field Build-
ing and gave Michigan a 4-3
victory.
"It was a moment," Maloney
said. "It's been a while since we've
had something like that at the
right time."
Then, less than one inning into

the second game, Maloney's entire
outlook changed as he watched his
team quickly fall behind 4-0.
"It was batting practice (for
the Eagles) in that second game,"
Maloney said. "That's what it
was."
In the nightcap, the Eagles
dominated Michigan with four
longballs en route to their 11-5
victory.
The Wolverines struggled at
the plate all day. In the first game,
they batted 5-for-21, and in the
second game they batted a slightly
improved 8-for-30.
Michigan was no better from
the mound. Maloney emptied
his bullpen as the Wolverines
again struggled with inconsistent
pitching with two devastating
innings in the second game where
the Eagles scored four and five
runs.
Junior Jeff DeCarlo got the start
for Michigan, but after allowing
four runs in one-third innings, he
was replaced by sophomore Travis
Smith.

Smith pitched 2.2 innings before
Maloney sent in freshman Kevin
Vangheluwe. Vangheluwe, with
similar results, gave up five runs in
less than an inning. Finally, Michi-
gan found some stability with red-
shirt sophomore Matt Gerbe, who
only gave up one run in the final
three innings.
"The bottom line is that if
we don't pitch better, then we
don't stand much of a chance,"
Maloney said. "But we can, I just
believe we can. I'm not giving
up."
Michigan has struggled all year
with spotty pitching and defensive
difficulties. In the past five losses,
the Wolverines have given up at
least 10 runs and made a combined
10 errors.
"I did not expect this many
games where we would give up
that many runs," Maloney said. "I
just didn't see it coming. I'm still
hopeful, as crazy as it may sound,
despite watching this myself. I just
know these guys are better than
that."

Maloney finds his confidence
from the glimmers of hope he
sees in each game. In yesterday's
games, junior catcher Chris Ber-
set and sophomore pitcher Tyler
Burgoon both returned to the field
after suffering injuries earlier this
season.
Maloney trusted Burgoon to
pitch the final four outs of the
first game - including a span that
saw a scoring threat that LaMarre
diffused late in the sixth inning -
but Burgoon was able to pull
through.
For the Wolverines to win
their intrastate battle with the
Michigan State this weekend, a
leader will have to emerge each
game and set a model for the
rest of the team as it tries to find
consistency on a game-to-game
basis.
"Sooner or later, you're just
waiting for someone to step up and
rise up to the occasion and right
now we're not doing that and we'll
keep trying, we'll keep battling,"
Maloney said.

Pitching leads 'M'
to five-inning mercy

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
EasternMichiganmade the short
bus ride to Alumni Field yesterday
to play the Michigan softball team.
Exactly an hour and a half later, the
Eagles were thankful the bus ride
back to Ypsilanti, was short, too.
The
abbrevi- EASTERN MICH. 0
ated com- MICHIGAN 9
mute left
little time to dwell on their hitless
outing.
Michigan's pair of ace pitch-
ers, sophomore Jordan Taylor and
junior Nikki Nemitz, combined for
a no-hitter in yesterday's 9-0 win
over Eastern Michigan.
After three hitless innings,
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
pulled her starting pitcher, Taylor,
for fellow All-American Nemitz.
Hutchins told the pitchers before
the game they would split time, and
Nemitz was ready to go. She struck
out four in two scoreless innings to
finish the combined no-hitter in a
mercy-rule shortened, five-inning
game.
The pair would have enjoyed a
combined perfect game had it not
been for one small mishap. Just one
Eastern Michigan runner reached
S FTALL

base the whole day after fresh-
man catcher Amanda Chidester
lost track of a third strike. The ball
bounced off the backstop, and by
the time Chidester located it, the
runner had already reached safely.
Taylor had her third consecu-
tive strong outing after struggling
for much of the last month. And
her newfound success could reach
another level soon; she is currently
developing a backdoor curveball.
"We've been working on it all fall
so today is the first time I actually
got to throw it," Taylor said. "We
only threw it twice, but both times
it was successful."
The offense gave their pitchers
plenty of support, scoring nine runs
in the first three innings.
After consecutive walks by
juniors Roya St. Clair and Maggie
Viefhaus, sophomore Dorian Shaw
stepped to the plate and got the
scoringstarted with a home run.
The ball traveled well beyond
the scoreboard, clearing the pine
trees behind the centerfield fence
and nearly landing in the baseball
stadium.
"I'm pretty good at reacting
inside because I have relatively
quick hands," Shaw said. "I was
lookingfor (a pitch outside), because
she was throwing everybody in the

right-handed batter's box a lot of
outside pitches. I just reacted and
that's what I need to start doing
more."
The three-run shot was her sev-
enth of the year and her first since
Mar. 28.
"I wasn't really seeing the ball
very well," said Shaw, referring to
the past few weeks. "I was so eager
to hit it, and I'm watching it halfway
to the plate and not all the way and
that will mess you up every single
time. I was popping a lot straight
up in the air, miles high, and it just
finally started to level out."
The blowout gave Hutchins a
final chance to get some of her
reserve players extended playing
time before the heart of conference
play begins.
The lopsided win extended
Michigan's win streak to 10 games
just before the tough stretch start.
The Wolverines, third in the con-
ference standings, need help to win
the conference after getting swept
in their Big Ten opener against
Northwestern.
Sitting one game behind the
Wildcats, the Wolverines can pres-
sure the Big Ten leaders this week-
end, as they head to Champaign ARIEL BOND/Dai
for a two-game series against the Sophomore first baseman Dorian Shaw hit her team-leading seventh home run on the season in a 9-0 win over Eastern
Illini. Michigan yesterday. Shaw was one of two Wolverines that notched a multi-hit game in the five-inning mercy victory.

I saw it get past her glove, I just
had my eye on first base. I sighed
in relief."
The bases were loaded when
Ryan came up to hit, and she tal-
lied her first career RBI when
she sent junior designated hitter
Dorian Shaw home for the Wolver-
ines' seventh run of the day.
In high school, Ryan started
every game in three different
sports - soccer, basketball and
softball. She wasn't sure if she
wanted to play basketball or soft-
ball in college, so she took time to
make a decision.
By the time she picked softball,

most schools had already finished
their recruiting.
Ryan applied to Michigan
because being a Wolverine was a
family legacy, but originally, she
had no intention of becoming one
herself.
"When I found out that I got
into Michigan, I just thought it
was an education that I couldn't
turn down," Ryan said. "I didn't
know if I was going to make the
team or not. But it was a risk that
I was willing to take. I just thank
God that I made the team. I feel
very blessed."
After a day of tryouts at the

beginning of her freshman year,,
Ryan was told to come back for:
day two. She continued to prac--
tice with the team for three weeks
before she was told she had made
the roster.
She has been practicingfive days
a week for the last two years but
has never had much of a chance to
leave the bench - until her third-
inning single flew over Eastern
Michigan pitcher Staci Skodinski's
glove.
"Oh, it felt good," Ryan said
reflecting on her first collegiate'
hit. "They all gave me high fives
and were pretty excited for me."

If you struggle with indecision,
stay away from Stucchi's. An Ann
Arbor original, Stucchi's has almost
too many incredibly delicious
flavors. Ranging from the sinful
White Russian Fudge to the quirky
PB Truffle Shuffle (alongwith ever-
pleasing classics like Strawberry
and French Vanilla), there is always
a flavor to suit any mood.
In case caloric morals inter-
fere, Stucchi's also offers frozen
yogurts of which the variety is
just as expansive (Swiss Choco-
late Almond, anyone?), so sacri-
ficing taste is never a concern.
Milkshakes, smoothies, sorbet and
soft-serve ice cream are also avail-
able, catering to cravings of every
dessert domain. Just to top it all
off, Stucchi's now offers Insom-
nia Cookies, making the menu so
irresistible and arousing it's almost

unsafe to read when young chil-
dren are nearby.
True dessert connoisseurs
will never run out of selections,
which is probably for the best
since choosing a favorite flavor or
combination is nearly impossible.
Luckily, you can always try plenty
of free samples to decipher your
own personal perfect combination.
Choosing a location isn't a concern,
either, since there are multiple
stores on campus. Stucchi's is that
best friend on gray days, or after
a break-up or when you've failed
an exam. Supplied with caramel,
chocolate, fresh fruit, nuts and
homemade chocolate-dipped waf-
fle cones, it's always there to ease
away any troubles.
Still notconvinced?Thenwe'll use
this age-old argument: Buy local.

Borders has been in Ann Arbor
since the '70s. It's a local business
- it was piloted here, in case you've
been living in a box. And even with
plummeting profits and bankrupt-
cy, the Liberty Street's Borders has
managed to keep some awesome
programs running.
Borders makes a point of bring-
ing in artists - both emerging and
well-established - for free con-
certs. Last year, artists including
Matt Nathanson visited, and Amer-
ican Idol finalist Melinda Doolittle
performed this February. This
weekend Indigo Girls, an Ameri-
can folk rock duo, is in town, and
last week saw Andressw Bird stop in
for a short set. Borders also has fre-
quent author readings. And though
it might now be a chain, it main-
tains its indie-flavored presence in
Ann Arbor as a local business just
as Shaman Drum does.
What makes it the best bookstore
in Ann Arbor? For one thing, it's
by far the largest. While it may not

afford the cozy bookshop feel some
bibliophilesyearnforits proportions
allow it to incorporate a expansive
selection of books, a sizable music
section and a quality coffee shop
(complete with, of course, comfort-
able seatingand study spaces).
The employees are great. What-
ever section you might be looking
in, they have a recommendation.
Some are listed on the bookshelves
as "staff picks," but more than that,
the staff actually knows what's
good - and they aren't only famil-
iar with headliners.
So although it might not be the
place to go for all your textbook
needs, if you ever want to browse or
just pick up that book your room-
mate said was amazing, Borders is
your place. Not only will it have that
ridiculously awesome book, but
you'll probably encounter another
couple great finds on your way out.
Not great for the pocketbook, but
perfect for the book lover.

Oh, Espresso Royale, truly the most noble of cof-
fee venues, you continue to awe us. Situated firmly at
a locus central to our travel on campus, your symbol
is a shining beacon of hope for the downtrodden and
numb, those who seek only a caffeine injection to pro-
pel them through one more panic-ridden day of study.
Inside, your tables and chairs offer comforting, wel-
coming sites of study when the UGLi is full of noisy
freshmen. Your majestic tones of brown and deep red
exultantly restore our energy, similar to how your cof-
fee restores us like an IV full of saline. Yours, Espresso
Royale, is a kingdom free of meaningless distractions.
Among your competitors, who could challenge

you? Not Amer's! And as for the rest, ha! What "rest?"
Starbucks, without pretension toward independence?
Surely not Ambrosia or Rendezvous - what are they
in the face of your your innocuous accessibility? Great
king of coffee, you know the power of the horde, of
coffee handed out en masse to your subjects.
We return, Wednesday after Wednesday for your
$2 lattes. The rest of the week is an apathetic haze
as we survey the seat of your power, the drip coffee,
each variety calling out our names like an old friend.
There is no usurper, Espresso, no challenger. Your
throne is secure.
- BEN VANWAGONER

According to its website, Pizza
House is "A Slice of Chicago, in
your home town!!!" Making the
literal interpretation of that state-
ment a reality would require the
newest laser-drilling technology,
the cooperation of millions of peo-
ple, hundreds of billions of dollars
and a ton of helicopters (and once
we airlifted the slice of city over
here, we wouldn't even have a good
place to put it). Luckily for us, it
turns out Pizza House was actu-
ally using a form of metonymy and
referring to Chicago-style pizza
(who knew?), which is not only far
easier to accomplish, but also much
more delicious.

Pizza House is a great place to go
for some deep-dish delights. Locat-
ed conveniently on Church Street
between South University and Wil-
lard Street, it's never a far walk -
unless you live on North Campus,
in which case you have my deepest
condolences. But never fear, neigh-
bors to the north, for Pizza House
delivers until the miraculous hour
of 4 a.m., setting it apart from the
competition. So whether you live in
East Quad and are too lazy to cross
the street to satisfy your late night
munchies or you're being held as a
hungry hostage on North Campus
by the tyrannous bus schedule,
Pizza House will bring a saucy

solution straight to your door.
There are some who think Pizza
House is overpriced, and to be fair, it
is kind of expensive. I believe it was
Winston Churchill who once said
"responsibility is the price of great-
ness." But at Pizza House, the price
of greatness starts at around $10.99.
As far as the pizza itself goes,
Pizza House does a pretty damn
good job emulating the city of Chi-
cago's success on the pizza front.
And it smells and looks as good as
it tastes. Whether you go deep-dish
or not, your taste buds, nostrils and
retinae will all leave happy - even
if your wallet doesn't.
- JAMIE BLOCK

Good No Thai! customers are astute when it comes to the art of purchas-
ing No Thai! food. They scoff pretentiously at those they overhear ponder-
ingwhat a restaurantecalled No Thai! would serve ("Why would a restaurant
make a point of telling people what they don'tserve?"). They smile to them-
selves when novice customers contemplate the meaning of the question
mark following "medium" on the menu's list of spice levels. (Though to be
fair, "medium?" isn't the best assessment of the spiciness it stands for)
The whimsicality of No Thai!'s misnomer, casual use of punctuation
and foreign cuisine make it the perfect place to grab a deliciously fill-
ing meal while feelingtotally indifferent about how hipster, indie, scene,
urban or bohemian you look (or whatever else you youngsters are cur-
rently striving to be these days).
For those who claim they judge restaurants based on food quality
and aren't concerned with their image: You're not fooling anyone. In all
seriousness, though, two remarkable qualities of No Thai! cuisine keep
customers satisfied and ensure return visits.
First, No Thai!'s food smells almost better than it tastes, and it tastes
great. If you're low on cash, you can get roughly the same satisfaction
from standing outside the restaurant and enjoying exotic scents as you
can from actually indulging in its flavorful dishes.
But No Thai's best achievement lies is its ability to create meals that
survive collegiate conditions. Surprisingly, the week-old No Thai! left-
overs lying in your refrigerator will taste just as good after two minutes
in the microwave. Thank goodness for large portions, take-out boxes
and those newfangled radiation machines.
More hip than Jimmy John's, but void of Bubble Island's predomi-
nately freshmen patronage and mysterious food-like substances (what
are those bubbles made of anyway?), No Thai! is the best eatery on South
University.

I don't really have to tell you
this, because in your heart you
already know it: Ashley's is what
a bar is supposed to be. At Ash-
ley's, patrons can find the finest
of drinks, the closest of friends
and - the deal-breaker - the
most perfect of atmospheres. The
heavenly joint's honey-brown and
milk-chocolaty hues, weathered
brick walling and hazy lights all
blanket guests in a fuzzy, welcom-
ing warmth, mercifully providing
short respite from a seemingly
otherwise unforgiving, cold world
outside. This is your place.
Somewhere, lost in the threads
of our progressively deteriorating
American culture, drinking has
been reduced to an oft-repeated
machismo parade of pushing
through packed houses filled with
blaring music in order to knock
back a shot. Silly freshmen, drink-
ing's not for kids. Beers need to be
nursed, loved and cradled, and for
god's sake, there should be some
bloody conversation while you're
sipping your brew. This, after
all, is the sport of pub drinking,
and within this sport, Ashley's is
Wrigley Field.
Ashley's tabletops, graced with
the carved signatures of patrons
who have come before you, now

serve as a resting place for your
best friends' elbows. With your
friends in close proximity, con-
versation - that lovely thing that
goes hand-in-hand with alcoholic
beverages - naturally happens.
Maybe this is the reason Ashley's,
Ann Arbor's bar of bars, is consid-
ered sacred ground.
Ashley's,though, isnotendeared
by Ann Arborites and University
students alike solely because of its
homey environment. At Ashley's,
beers flow magically from seem-
ingly infinite taps. Aside from the
70 draught beers normally avail-
able (including rare beers that
can't be found anywhere else in
Michigan, like Schneider Aventi-
nus, a wheat ale from Kelheim,
Germany), there's a rotating tap
that brings limited specialtybrews
to the lips of those residing in Ann
Arbor. Simply put, Ashley's' selec-
tion is unparalleled.
The formula, the one that has
made it so renowned, is simple:
provide people with a good place
to drink good beers. While other
establishments might have lost
sight what makes a bar truly a bar,
Ashley's embraces these essential
bare-bones principles. And that's
why we embrace Ashley's.

I CAN HAZSUMMER7?

Angelo's Restaurant, located
on the corner of Glen Avenue
and Catherine Street, has been
an Ann Arbor staple since 1956.
Angelo Vangelatos and his wife
Patricia Verames opened the
business a few years after Angelo
arrived from Greece, and the res-
taurant has been bustling ever
since. Angelo and Patricia's son
Steve and his wife Jennifer run
the eatery these days, and they
are determined to keep the res-
taurant running the way it was
originally run.
Angelo's breakfast is so great
it inspired a famous song by Dick
Siegel. The song is played when
restaurant's website loads, and
patrons can purchase the album
itself at the restaurant's cash reg-
ister.
"Eggs over easy, hash browns
and toast" is what Dick chose to
order, but you'll find plenty of
other tummy-pleasing options
there as well.
The restaurant offers classics
from French toast and scrambled
eggs to more elaborate dishes
like Crabby Benedict and pump-
kin pancakes. The wide variety
of food ensures that everybody
will find something to his or her
liking. The assortment is a big
reason Angelo's has won Best
Breakfast in Ann Arbor not only
this year, but several times in the
past. And with its devoted fol-
lowing that spans generations,
it's obvious Angelo's is a mainstay
in Ann Arbor.
And what if you're on the
run? Desperately need caffeine
and a quick breakfast? Stop into
Angelo's on the Side, a small cof-
fee house/carry out building
attached to the restaurant. Grab
a cappuccino, a pastry or your
favorite meal in a convenient
doggie bag. Angelo's on the Side
is also a great place to pick up
Angelo's famous homemade rai-
sin bread.
Be reminded, however, that
if you're planning to visit Ange-
lo's for a tasty and traditional
sit-down breakfast, pack your
patience. The place is often
packed by Ann Arborites and the
line to get into the popular eatery
is often out the door and around
the corner.
