Physical description
of assailant released
as inquiry continues
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment is continuing to investigate
allegations that a Blue Cab driver
made unwanted advances on a
female client on Sunday. The inci-
dent comes a week after a student
reported she was raped, by an
unknown cabbie.
The incident occurred at around
3:30 a.m. onthe 1100 block of South
University Avenue, according to
AAPD Sgt. Mike Scherba. The
woman told police that the driver
touched her leg and kissed her
before droppingher off.
The latest assault was reported
Sunday evening. AAPD has not yet
named the suspect, but describes
him as a dark-skinned male with a
light beard, 29 to 35 years old.
The driver was employed by
the Blue Cab taxi company, which
declined to give any comment on
the incident. Blue Cab's website
states that its cabs are operated by
independently contracted drivers,
but all taxi companies and drivers

must be licensed with the city to be
in accordance with Ann Arbor law.
However, some cabs pick up pas-
sengers as fixed-rate limousines to
avoid licensing fees.
University Police spokeswoman
Diane Brown said AAPD officials
confirmed to her that the woman
attacked was not a student.
AAPD Sgt. Mike Scherba said
investigators are working to deter-
mine whether the assault is related
to previous incidents.
"Our investigators are look-
ing into the (latest) incident and
the possibility of it being linked
to other incidents of the recent
past."
On Feb. 3, a 21-year-old stu-
dent reported that she was raped
by a taxi driver in an off-campus
parking lot on the 300 block of
East Madison Street. The cab
company was not named in that
incident.
Brown added that a University
Police crime alert was not emailed
to the campus community because
the crime did not occur on campus
and does not involve sexual assault
in its legal definition. Crime alerts
are generally sent out when UMPD
qffcals determine t4 4 suspect
or trend in crime poses a continu-
ous threat to the University com-
munity.

$500K study will
explore genetic
differentiation
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
All humans begin as a single
cell that divides and eventually
forms the complex structure
of the human body. However,
the process by which one cell
gives rise to hundreds of differ-
ent types in humans is largely a

mystery to scientists.
Yukiko Yamashita, a
research assistant professor at
the University's Life Sciences
Institute, has been awarded a
$500,000 W. M. Keck Foun-
dation grant to study the bio-
logical processes behind cell
division and differentiation.
The organization is known
in the scientific community
for funding "high-risk, high-
reward" research projects.
The grant will likely fund
the next two years of research
at Yamashita's lab, where

researchers aim to shed light
on one of the most basic ques-
tions of modern biology: how
genetically identical cells can
develop different functions in
the human body.
"When one cell becomes
two, this is supposed to be an
exact copying process, but then
if you are exactly copying (the
cells), we shouldn't be us -
(we're) made of different kinds
of cells," Yamashita said.
"If (all cells) were just the
same, you would just be 100
or 200 pounds of cell mass,"

Yamashita continued. "But we
are not ... all of the cells in our
body are different and know
how to coordinate."
The lab research hypothe-
sizes the link to this cell differ-
entiation lies within the cell's
genetic material - its DNA.
"Quite a bit of who you are
is defined by what kind of gene
combination you have, and this
information is stored in DNA,"
Yamashita said. "All DNA is
like an encyclopedia, (it holds)
everything about you - what

'Evangelist' says
alumni are big
advantage in
search for jobs
By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily StaffReporter
Awkwardly hinting that
you want a'summer internship
is much easier than it would
have been just a few years ago
thanks to online tools that con-
nect prospective employers and
job seekers,
John Hill, LinkedIn's high-
er-education "evangelist",
lectured to 150 University
students at the Alumni Cen-
ter Monday about networking
and building a personal brand
through LinkedIn. Launched
in 2003, LinkedIn is a profes-
sional networking site with
approximately 200 million
users.
In his presentation, Hill dis-
cussed the importance of creat-
ing a compelling and effective
network, establishing qual-
ity relationships and taking
risks in utilizing LinkedIn as
a professional resource. Hill
emphasized that reaching out
to alumni to build networks
and create meaningful profes-
sional relationships is vital to
students' success during and
after college.

"I think in the U.S. there's an
emotional connection back to
the institution; there's a lot of
school spirit," Hill said. "(This
leads) to that emotional con-
nection back to an institution
and that opens up the door for
one Wolverine to connect with
another Wolverine."
Hill encouraged students to
be adventurous in their profes-
sional pursuits, reminding his
audience that the University's
alumni network can help along
the way.
"What I'm asking of you is to
dream big," Hill said. "Go out
for the opportunities that are
there for you ... I will show you
the pathways of U of M, where
you can get to where you want
to go."
According to a Harvard
Business School study, 65 to 85
percent of jobs are found not
through formal searches, but
rather through networking and
personal connections.
Laura Turner, the Alumni
Association's senior career ser-
vices manager, said she coor-
dinated this event to educate
students about LinkedIn as a
vital professional resource and
about the University's network
on LinkedIn. According to
Turner, there are more than
190,000 University alumni on
the networking site.
"I can't underestimate
the power of leveraging the

plan new
bike-share
program
Second phase of
expansion begins
after Blue Bike rentals
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
The University is teamingup with
Ann Arbor's Clean Energy Coalition
to bring a simplified bike-share pro-
gram to campus and downtown Ann
Arbor, beginning the second phase
of a push for bike transit.
The CEC is a non-profit organi-
zation that works with a number of
partners,'including the University
and the Ann Arbor Transportation
Authority to focus on decreasing
fossil fuel emissions and promoting
the use of clean energy.
The idea for the bike-sharing
program began with University
President Mary Sue Coleman's sus-
tainability address last year. In her
remarks, she touched on her wish to
bring a bike-sharing program to Ann
Arbor similar to the ones that had
been successful on other university
campuses. Students have advocated
for the program in recent years as
well.
Stephen Dolen, executive director
of Parking and Transportation Ser-
vices, formed a partnership with the
CEC, the Downtown Development
Authority and the AATA to launch
the program. Dolan said while the
groups have all committed to work-
ing on the project, some technical

From Britain to A2

Lacy Hartley is an associate
professor of English. She has
taught in from Great Britain.
What do you teach?
Officially, 19th century Brit-
ish literature. I teach courses
that are more about theories of
literature, theories of art and of
language. ButtI also teach a Vic-
torian novel class - a graduate
course about Charles Darwin,
George Eliot and scientific ideas.
What is your favorite thing
to teach?
Theory. The course I'm
teaching is called "Is Literature
Art?" It starts with Plato and
CRIME NOTES

Aristotle and ends with cur-
rent ideas about literature and
whether it is spectacle in the
world, whether it is producing
truth, if it's singular or plural
and whether it should serve any
social, political, moral purpose
or whether it just is a form that
we admire and that moves us in
such ways. It's a great class; it's
fantastic.
What is the best thing you
have learned while working
at the University?
Every time you go into a
classroom, at whatever level,
you learn something from the
students. Students here are
wonderfully willing to give

forth their opinions and toss up
ideas, and so the discussions are
always exciting and sometimes
unpredictable, but also fun. It
doesn't feel like work. That cer-
tainly wasn't always the case
teaching in Britain. There's a
very big distinction and a dif-
ferent level of formality and
stance. There it's definitely
more formal and it's a very dif-
ferent structure for teaching.
So, do you enjoy it more
here than you do in Britain?
I do. And that you can quote

Kwame Kilpatrick turned
Detroit's City Hall into a "pri-

Pope Benedict XVI celebrates a mass for priests and nuns in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican on Feb. 2.
Pope's bombshell sends'
troubled church scrambling

Benedict XVI
resigns due to his
Parkinson's disease
VATICAN CITY (AP) - With
a few words in Latin, Pope
Benedict XVI did what no pope
has done in more than half a
millennium, stunning the world
by announcing his resignation
Monday and leaving the already
troubled Catholic Church to
replace the leader of its 1 billion
followersby Easter.
Not even his closest associates
had advance word of the news, a
bombshell that he dropped dur-
ing a routine meeting of Vatican
cardinals. And with no clear
favorites to succeed him, anoth-
er surprise likely awaits when
the cardinals elect Benedict's
successor next month.
"Without doubt this is a his-
toric moment," said Cardinal
Christoph Schoenborn, a prote-
ge and former theology student
of Benedict's who is considered
a papal contender. "Right now,
1.2 billion Catholics the world
over are holdingtheir breath."
The Feb. 28 resignation
allows for a fast-track con-
clave to elect a new pope, since
the traditional nine days of
mourning that would follow
a pope's death doesn't have to
be observed. It also gives the
85-year-old Benedict great sway
over the choice of his successor.
Though he willnot himselfvote,
he has hand-picked the bulk of
the College of Cardinals - the
princes of the church who will
elect his successor - to guaran-
tee his conservative legacy and
ensure an orthodox future for
the church.
The resignation may mean
that age will become less of a fac-
tor when electing a new pope,
since candidates may no longer
feel compelled to stay for life.
"For the century to come, I
think that none of Benedict's
successors will feel morally
obliged to remain until their
death," said Paris Cardinal
Andre Vingt-Trois.
Benedict said as recently as
2010 that a pontiff should resign

if he got too old or infirm to do
the job, but it was a tremendous
surprise when he said in Latin
that his "strength of mind and
body" had diminished and that
he couldn't carry on. He said he
would resign effective 8 p.m.
local time on Feb.28.
"All the cardinals remained
shocked and were looking at
each other," said Monsignor
Oscar Sanchez of Mexico, who
was in the room at the time of
the announcement.
As a top aide, Benedict
watched from up close as Pope
John Paul II suffered publicly
from the Parkinson's disease
that enfeebled him in the final
years of his papacy. Clearly
Benedict wanted to avoid the
same fate as his advancing age
took its toll, though the Vatican
insisted the announcement was
not prompted by any specific
malady.
The Vatican said Benedict
would live in a congregation for
cloistered nuns inside the Vati-
can, although he will be free to
go in and out. Much of this is
unchartered territory. The Vati-
can's chief spokesman, the Rev.
Federico Lombardi, said he isn't
even sure of Benedict's title -
perhaps "pope emeritus."
Since becoming pope in 2005,
Benedict has charted a very con-
servative course for the church,
trying to reawaken Christianity
in Europe where it had fallen
by the wayside and return the
church to its traditional roots,
which he felt had been betrayed
by a botched interpretation of
the modernizing reforms of the
Second Vatican Council.
His efforts though, were
overshadowed by a worldwide
clerical sex abuse scandal, com-
munication gaffes that outraged
Jews and Muslims alike and,
more recently, a scandal over
leaked documents by his own
butler. Many of his stated pri-
orities as pope also fell short:
He failed to establish relations
with China, heal the schism
and reunite with the Orthodox

There are several papal-con-
tenders in the wings, but no
obvious front-runner - the
same situation as when Bene-
dict was elected after the death
of John Paul. As in recent elec-
tions, some push is expected for
the election of a Third World
pope, with several names
emerging from Asia, Africa and
Latin America, home to about
40 percent of the world's Catho-
lics.
The Vatican stressed that
no specific medical condition
prompted Benedict's decision,
saying he remains fully lucid
and took his decision indepen-
dently.
"Any interference or inter-
vention is alien to his style,"
Lombardi said.
The pope has clearly slowed
down significantly in recent
years, cutting back his foreign
travel and limiting his audienc-
es. He now goes to and from the
altar in St. Peter's Basilica on a
moving platform to spare him
the long walk down the aisle.
Occasionally he uses a cane.
As early as 2010, Benedict
began to look worn out: He had
lost weight and didn't seem
fully engaged when visiting
bishops briefed him on their
dioceses. But as tired as he
often seemed, he would also
bounce back, enduring searing
heat in Benin to bless a child
and gamely hanging on when
a freak storm forced him to cut
short a speech during a youth
festival in Madrid in 2011.
His 89-year-old brother,
Georg Ratzinger, said doctors
recently advised the pope not
to take any more trans-Atlantic
trips.
"His age is weighing on him,"
Ratzinger told the dpa news
agency in Germany. "At this age,
my brother wants more rest."
"He has looked veryvery run
down," agreed U.S. Cardinal
Edwin O'Brien, who was pres-
ent for Monday's announce-
ment, speaking to Sirius XM's
"The Catholic Channel.

Turner said. "And LinkedIn is the
perfect platform for making that
happen."
The strong alumni presence
on LinkedIn has been extremely
beneficial to students' profession-
al endeavors, Turner added.
"Certainly, students whom I've
worked with in the past have gone

lot of them can attribute it to the

one would have to agree that
judges serve only the law and to
have all this unaccountable influ-
ence in our judicial campaigns is
certainly corrosive of the trust
and confidence and the impartial-
ity of the judiciary."
Many of the panelists said the
negativity of issue advertise-
ments also calls for concern.
Sarosi argued that issue ads
don't focus on the relevant char-
acteristics of the candidates.
"The problem with these ads
- that I've seen throughout this
election - is it doesn't really tell

"Bringing three entities of the

The CEC has taken the lead on

Sarosi personally experi-
enced the anxieties of facing
issue advertising while working
on McCormack's state Supreme
Court campaign.Inthelastweeks
of the election, the conservative
Judicial Crisis Network launched
a million-dollar attack campaign
against McCormack. The com-
mercial criticized McCormack's
role in the defense of an alleged
terrorism case involving Guan-
tanamo detainee Wahldof Abdul
Mokit.
"I just don't agree that they're
helpful to the conversation and
they're certainly not helpful to
the collegiality that one needs
when one gets to the Court and
has to work with six other jus-
tices," Sarosi said.
In response to the negative
ads, former Justice Kelly said a
possibility would be creating an
organization separate from the
government and partisan politics
that would review issue ads, simi-
lar to media outlets like Politifact,

Dan Marshall, an assistant cam-
pus recreation director.
The new bike-sharing plan
targets students as well as Ann
Arbor residents. It ultimately
aims to have' multiple pick-up

Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community rela-
tions, said the bike-sharing pro-
gram would help transportation
options for residents in the com-
munity.

kind of skin color, hair color or
eye color - who you are."
During cell replication, each
new cell receives a copy of all
the genetic information stored
in the parent cell's DNA.
When a parent cells under-
goes cell division, it forms two
genetically identical daughter
cells. By studying stem cells
from , fruit flies, the lab has
discovered slight differences
between these daughter cells.
Yamashita said figuring out
why cells adapt to different
characteristics even though
their DNA contents are indis-
tinguishable has been a "funda-
mental mystery in biology."
Yamashita's lab has theo-
rized that the different cell
expressions are due, in part, to
epigenetic markers on the cell's
DNA. These epigenetic mark-
ers can best be understood as
"bookmarks" placed into the
cell's "instruction book," which
is the DNA molecule, Yamashita
said. Different markers exist for
skin, blood and other aspects of,
the body.

"Somehow (cells) distin-
guish (which bookmark to use)
and segregate them into two,"
Yamashita said. "This is the first
direct evidence that cells are
capable of distinguishing two
sane-DNA molecules."
Using these "bookmarks,"
human cells only express some
of the genetic traits found in
DNA. For example, skin cells
do not develop the same neu-
rotransmitters found in the
brain, but instead express the
pigment melanin, which creates
skin color.
The genetic bookmarks are
formed by a chemical process
known as methylation. This
process attaches a chemical
group to the outside of the DNA
molecule at a specific location,
which usually suppresses the
gene in that area.
"How much of the DNA is
methylated - where it is meth-
ylated - affects where cells
actually transcribe the genes
- which genes to activate,"
Yamashita said. "Cells somehow
can distinguish which DNA
copy is more methylated or less
methylated."
Despite the currently accu-
mulated knowledge of cell divi-

sion, Yamashita said more work
must be done to determine the
exact mechanisms by which
these genetic processes take
place.
"Our discovery only tells us
cells can distinguish two DNA
(molecules) that look the same,
but are probably different,"
Yamashita said. "We want to
know ... exactly how they are
different."
"This might answer this most
fundamental question in biol-
ogy - how we multicellular
organisms, made of a hundred
trillion cells, came from a single
cell," Yamashita said. "If you
understand this, the implication
is huge."
These consequences include
possible medical advancements.
She added that his team hopes
to use the long-lasting grant
to get some concrete answers
about cell division within two
years.
"The fundamental under-
standing is always the basis of
medical research," Yamashita
said. "If we contribute anything
to the knowledge of funda-
mental biology ... we can come
up with ideas of how to cure
(genetic diseases)."

Funding the future
Gov. Snyder needs to redirect budget emphasis on education
M ichigan Gov. Rick Snyder's newly unveiled budget for fis-
cal year 2014 calls for a slight raise in funding for higher
education - a 2-percent increase from the last year. While
the increase seems like a good move on the surface, modest growth in
education spending comes after large cuts that occurred over the past
two years, including a staggering 15-percent cut for 2012 and a 3-per-
cent reduction the year before. While Snyder's increase in education
funding recognizes the need to invest in this area after two years of
hard cuts, his desired increase isn't sufficient enough to be effective.

The longest odds offered by the bookie are
1,000 to 1 on the Irish singer Bono, who is
not Catholic, and the Irish television star
Father Dougal Maguire, who is not real."

website Paddy Power after Pope Benedict XVI announced his retirement Monday.

Snyder's billincludes a 2-percent increase for
both higher education and community colleges.
State universities and community colleges are
both funded on performance-based measure-
ments. Universities' performances are based
on the number of federal Pell Grant recipients
they have, undergraduate degree completions
and adherence to tuition-cost restraint. Snyder
plans to have $100 million in bonds to allocate
to universities that try to increase graduation
rates and the number of students enrolled in
engineering. For community colleges, $8.5 mil-
lion will be distributed to those that increase
degrees in critical skills areas.
Because of Snyder's previous cuts, a 2-per-
cent increase - which may not keep pace with
inflation - is not enough. As Michigan con-
tinues to suffer from a brain-drain effect - or
the widespread emigration of highly skilled
individuals - a larger focus must be placed on
sustainable education. Michigan needs a larger
increase in higher education to stay nationally
and globally competitive, improve the econo-
my in the future and make up for the cuts of
the last two years.
Snyder's budget also calls for incentives in
the state's community colleges, offering $8.5
million for local colleges that produce gradu-
ates in science, technology, ingineering and

mathematics fields. However, these incentives
should be expanded to four-year institutions.
Larger universities also struggle with produc-
ing majors in these so-called "critical areas." By
expanding these incentive programs to bigger
state intuitions, Snyder can ensure the innova-
tion that he championed for in his campaign.
Increasing the number of graduates who
stay in the state must also become a goal for
Snyder. In 2009, only 24.6 percent of Michi-
gan's population held a bachelor's degree or
higher. The governor could look into other
ideas, like tax incentives for college gradu-
ates who stay in state - a policy Maine has
adopted. Other states, most notably Penn-
sylvania, have thought of forgiving student
loans for those graduates who decide to work
in state. Gov. Snyder needs to look at more
efficient ways of improving and utilizing edu-
cation in Michigan.
Snyder has started, slowly but surely, to
increase education funding. His proposedbud-
get does call for increases, but the increases are
insignificantcompared to the cutshe has made
in the past. He also lacks ideas about ways to
improve college education in Michigan and
should be working to keep recent graduates in
state. Snyder must be more ardent in his plans
to better Michigan's education.

'm throwing a "Jumanji"-
themed party on Valentine's
Day.
For those
unlucky souls
who've never '
seen it, "Juman-
ji" is a 1995
children's flick
about a magic
board game that
puts partici- ANDREW
pants in jungle- ECKHOUS
themed danger
after every roll
of the dice. Roll a two and you may
find your home infested with mur-
derous vines. Finish the game and
all of your troubles disappear.
I didn't choose this theme as a
method of flipping love the bird,
and I'm not trying to say that rela-
tionships are plagued with the
same arbitrary pitfalls as a turn in
"Jumanji." Rather, I want to redefine
what Valentine's Day can be.
Last week, my housemate Dave
and I had a disagreement about
Valentine's Day traditions. He con-
cluded that Valentine's Day should
be about loving yourself, not oth-
ers. He obviously put quite a bit of
thought into his argument, as he
methodically outlined his rationale.
It boiled down to three points: 1) Too
many people spend an inordinate
amount of time cultivating a public
image and neglectingthemselves; 2)
Even though we're constantly think-
ing about ourselves, it's often times
stressful (i.e. grades, job/internship
applications); and 3)1f we can't love
orselves,-then we can't love'others.
Why take a day to love others when
most people don't have time for
themselves?
Though I rarely waste my time
pontificating on the meaning of
Valentine's Day, Dave's arguments
made me think. While there aren't

any indices that accurately quan-
tify any of his three points, there are
trends in our culture that seem to
bolster his assertions.
While casting social media as
Satan's tool to destroy our grammar
and our confidence is far too easy,
there are some legitimately nega-
tive side effects that support Dave's
first point. Facebook and the never-
ending quest for 'likes' expose the
lengths to which our obsession with
perception has gone. There's a suf-
focating need for ubiquitous expo-
sure. Posting PhotoBooth selfies and
pictures from a weekend in Chicago
may seem self-indulgent, but it's also
a strategic attempt to impress one's
virtual friends.
Is thatany differentthan the past?
Not really. People have always been
presenting themselves strategically,
and they always will. But now it's
constant. Between Facebook, Twit-
ter and Instagram, I can manipu-
late my image all day, every day,
and that can be both stressful and
exhausting. There's a reason studies
have shown that social media can
increase anxiety and insecurity.
Dave's second point seems valid
as well. As a second-semester senior,
I can attest that every week, I devote
hours to stressing about jobs, school-
work and the added burden of check-
ing every box on my 'before I leave
Ann Arbor' checklist. It's hard to
find time for myself, and after three
years of hearing similar complaints
from nearly all of my friends, I know
I'm not the only one.
Many of us are overstressed, run-
ning on a diet of caffeine during the
week and alcohol during the week-
end. We're overexerting ourselves,
but we're constantly reminded that
we could be doing more. The Sha-
piro Undergraduate Library is now
open 24 hours a day, so why aren't
you studying all night? Want a bet-

ter GPA? Just spend about ten min-
utes searching for Adderall - it's
that easy.
Instead let's celebrate
our surroundings
and ourselves.

As for the last point, take that
with a grain of salt. "How can
you love someone if you don't love
yourself" is a common piece of
folk psychology, but what does it
mean? Why couldn't you love your-
self through loving others? Studies
have shown that committing acts
of kindness for others positively
affects one's own self-worth, illus-
tratingthat loving others can be the
key to loving one's self.
Dave's phrasing may be off for the
final point; but the sentiment sum-
marizes his argument. In order to
enjoy ourselves, we must understand
what makes us tick. Find your pas-
sion and immerse yourself in it. Your
sanity will thank you.
Valentine's Day doesn't need to be
another day of stress. For those who
enjoy the romantic side of Saint Val-
entine, go for it. But I think I'mgoing
to take a big step back and focus
on me (and no, that's not a double-
entendre). Valentine's Day should
celebrate love, but why should we
limit it to romantic love? Instead,
let's redefine the day to celebrate lov-
ing your surroundings and yourself.
I promise that my passion-doesn't
revolve around reenacting Jumanji
scenes. But right now, it's exactly
what I want to do. And if it makes me
happy, then why not celebrate it?

A university education means we belong to
a community. We learn with each other, but
also from each other. From our many perspec-
tives and experiences, we challenge ourselves
to be better students and better people. This is
why we're among the 'Leaders and Best.' This
process of education produces leadership in a
multitude of ways.
As tuition rises, students are paying more
and more to a student government that gives
back less and less. We aim to change that. We
are forUM, a new party and a new idea: From
our different pasts we come together as one
voice for the future so we can make profound,
long-lasting improvements to our campus
community.
We're led by students who come from a
wide range of academic and extracurricular
interests, a diverse set of backgrounds and a
vast array of skills and beliefs. We hold these
qualities to be assets - tools tested by the fires
of our passions - forged in the belief that we
might allay what divides us into an alloy of
what unites us.
ForUM is running LSA junior Chris Osborn
for president and LSA junior Hayley Sakwa
for vice president of the University's Central
Student Government. We chose them because
they represent the best of the University and
the best of our ideals.
Osborn currently serves as CSG treasurer
and has a financial prowess incomparable to
any other student on campus. This is criti-
cally important in understanding the intrica-
cies of an organization like CSG, where he has
successfully managed a $700,000 budget and
overseen 22 commissions. He's a proven leader
who deeply cares about this institution and
will do right by students as he has done time
and time again.
Sakwa volunteers her time in a variety of
roles, including at University of Michigan
Hillel and in the service fraternity Alpha
Phi Omega. In 2011, she founded the Jewish
Detroit Initiative, engaging University stu-
dents with city residents throughsocial action,
education and.fun. She's committed to foster-
ing a culturally inclusive university.
Now, we don't pretend to have all the
answers. Butthe oneswe dohave, we think, are

the best. These are the planks of our platform:
Equity: We would liketo see a student rep-
resentative on the Board of Regents. Many
other university boards have student represen-
tation, and we believe it's time our university
did too. Our 40,000-plus student population
deserves one seat at the table.
Accessibility: We'll advocate for an
increase in healthful food options on cam-
pus - especially the year-round availability
of fresh produce. We think it'd be a great idea
to make the MFarmers Market a permanent
institution, and perhaps open a caf4 dedicated
to fresh, local ingredients.
Synergy: Wait times and paperwork at
University Health Service are a nightmare.
Let's simplify things by putting critical infor-
mation - lists of medications and allergies,
blood types and health insurance - onto our
Mcards, so we can swipe in instead. The Uni-
versity figured out how to use an Mcard at TCF
ATMs; surely this isn't beyond ourreach.
Efficiency; We propose a common applica-
tion for student organization funding, taking
the current 15 or so down to one. This will
reduce paperwork, increase transparency and
smooth students' frustrations greatly.
Diversity: Finally, we must not forget that
these are just our ideas. We'd like to hear
yours. The strength of our university has
always been measured as much in the diverse
perspective students bring as it has in the
results they come up with. Following this
model, we'd like to use CSG as a medium to
foster collaboration between diverse student
groups on campus.
If you think we'd be a good fit for you, and
you for us, come to our mass meeting next
Tuesday, Feb. 19 in 3330 Mason Hall at 6 p.m.
We're individuals whose record of leadership
is second only to our conviction that a just and
more equitable university requires new lead-
ers and new ideas. We believe that the change
we seek is greater than the sum of our own
differences - that this idea binds us all to this
new forUM for student government.
Fortune favors the bold. Join us.
Eaghan Davis is an LSA junior, and
Taylor-Ryan Nedd is an LSA sophomore.

"( ouldyou be free
to meet up some
time later this



week?"
I click to my
Google Calen-
dar tab, scan
over the week
and quickly type
back, "How does
Thursday night
sound?" I have
no plans for that HEMA
evening, and I KARUNA-
figure it'll be a KARAM
great time to
schedule a casu-
al meeting.
Unfortunately, meetings usu-
ally involve more than one person,
and apparently I've made a terrific
blunder.
For those of you who haven't yet
recognized my gaffe, this Thursday is
Valentine's Day. Andbytheunspoken
rules thatnguide-us throughthe social
labyrinth that is college, I should be
spending that day either canoodling
with a romantic interest, commiser-
ating with single friends or celebrat-
ing rebellion against all Hallmark
holidays. Canoodling, commiserat-
ing or celebrating. There is no fourth
option; there is no room for arbitrary
meetings that don't acknowledge the
significance of Feb. 14.
And what is it about the 14th day
of the second month each year that
floods shops, restaurants and our
newsfeeds with infinite references
to all things pink and romantic? Leg-
ends abound referencing Pagan tra-
ditions, Christian martyrology and


Shakespearean literature - but none
of these things should dictate when
we do or don't celebrate our feelings.
Whether we support or denounce it,
why do we bother giving in to the
holiday at all?
If you're in a relationship of any
sort,youmostlikelyhavebetterdates
to celebrate: birthdays, anniversaries
or perhaps the first time you locked
eyes across the Diag? Instead of giv-
ing in to the Valentine's hype, it'd be
far more meaningful to do special
things on some other, more personal-
ly significant day. And if you're of the
party who prefers to celebrate Sin-
gle's Awareness Day - your relation-
ship status probably won't change in
the vicinity of Feb. 14, so why choose
to acknowledge it on this day spe-
cifically? The need to do something
in honor of one's relationship status
seems far too arbitrary.
But perhaps all of this has been
said too often. Increasingly, the new
trend is to shun such traditions alto-
gether and rebel against the holiday.
But choosing to not wear red, to not
go out to a nice dinner, to not wish
your friends a nice holiday, is still
acknowledging that something's
happening on Feb. 14 and you just
don't wantto be a part of it.--
Whether you're canoodling, com-
miserating or celebrating, what
difference does the date make?
Whatever your choice may be, you
can do this on any other day of the
year too. And, likewise, things
like meetings shouldn't need to be
rescheduled just because it's Feb. 14.
Yes, some people callithis Valentine's
Day; some people call it Single's

Awareness Day; but some people,
like me, think it shouldn't make a
difference in the way we, lead our
lives, one way or another.
It doesn't matter
whether I'm single
or taken on Feb.14.
So where will I be this Thursday?
Maybe you'll spot me on a date at a
fancy restaurant. Or maybe you'll
find me getting late-night dessert
with my roommate. Maybe, like last
year, you'll discover that I'm watch-
ing a decidedly un-romantic movie
(read: American Pie) with a decid-
edly single friend. And maybe, I'll
be holed up in the stacks all alone,
studyingformyupcomingmidterms.
This Thursday, it doesn't really
matter where I am or who I'm with.
It doesn't matter whether I'm single
or taken, whether I'm wearing red
or black, whether I'm enjoying gift-
ed chocolates or a cheap midnight
burrito - at least, not more than it
would any other day of the year.
If none of these things matter to
you, great. Feb. 14 is just another day
of the year. So let there be no Val-
entine's Day. And if they do matter,
that's fine too. Feb. 14 is just another
day of the year, so let every day be
Valentine's Day.

It clocks in at
around 40 minutes, but it feels a
lot shorter.
Everything has been amped'
up since Deez's debut, self-titled
album. His simple recordings
of guitar and percussion have
evolved into richly woven mixes
that showcase synths and samples
on top of the usual instrumenta-
tion. As the tracks thicken with
new layers, so does his lyrical con-
tent with new themes and emo-
tions.
The synths Deez has added to
his arsenal create a more elec-
tronic vibe and a science theme.
This new flavor comes out in the
first track, "(800) HUMAN,"
on which electronic drum kits
support his part-sci-fi, part-
existentialist lyrics. He goes full
nerd on "Redshift," a song full of
musings about the Big Bang and
the Doppler effect. It definitely
works - "Redshift" is the cli-
max of the album and arguably
the best song. It rises and falls
throughout, led by a powerful
falsetto and featuring a kick-ass

chorus.
There's also plenty of emo-
tional conflict in the album.
"You Can't Be My Girl" bites
with strife: It references a debate
about Gorbachev and features a
couple of hi-octane, Jack White-
style, whammy pedal solos. Not
too shabby. "Free (The Editorial
Me)" clearly tries to make some
serious social commentary.
Unfortunately, a final message
is not entirely evident. YouTube
hits, however, show that this
song has twice as many plays
as any other song on the album,
so listeners are definitely trying
hard to figure it out. He ends the
record with "Chelsea's Hotel," a
story of contentment and desire,
set in a seaside town whose
image he burns into your mind
through rich lyrics.
It's not all serious, though -
"Alice" is a straight-up love song,
and it gets a little sappy. Feel free
to listen to this if you have a far-

away lover, or if you want a cute
tingly feeling in your stomach.
"Moonlit" came straight from
the 1980s, and it grooves like it's
still there. Deez's usual meander-
ing mixes give way to a tight beat
that grinds hard on the backbeat.
Deez has been practicing,
too: He rips through some gui-
tar solos that didn't seem pos-
sible in the last album, and his
falsetto soars to new heights
with new clarity. His playing,
on "You Can't Be My Girl" sur-
prises with its technical skill,
but he really experiments with
his guitar on "No Love." The
track fills with different layers
- there's a plucky bass line in
the low register, an airy rhythm
guitar, an aggressive lead and a
cool, slurred riff that sounds like
his fingers are tripping over each
other down the fretboard. His
falsetto impresses at the front
end of the LP, shines in "Red-
shift" and shows its softer side

in "All in the Wrist."
Songs for Imaginative People
is fresh and will snag new listen-
ers just as it will impress fans of
the. last album. Its main downfall
is that it doesn't really shove any
memorable melodies into your
head on a first listen. Deez doesn't
have a "Bad Day" this time - a
song that will stick with you for
days until you just want it to be
gone. There's plenty to catch on to
after a day or two, but the vocals
might not be able to reel in the.
casual listener.
Darwin Deez released an
exclusive stream of the 'record
through NME, and he decided
to accompany it with a full, self-
written track guide. It seems a lit-
tle counterproductive that Songs
for Imaginative People comes with
an explanation for every song, but
maybe he's just accommodating
those who are less imaginative.
With or without the footnotes, it's
worth a listen.

Eye-opening short
documentaries

Sorrow seeps
through Oscar-
nominated films
By NATALIE GADBOIS
DailyArts Writer
Albert Einstein, once said,
"Any fool can know. The point is
to understand." Good documen-
taries give us the opportunity to
do just that, experience life from
very different perspectives and
understand the depths of human
strength. As an upper-middle-
class, educated and healthy Uni-
versity student, I know that awful
things occur in the world. But
before watching the 2013 Oscar-
nominated short documentaries,
I never would've known what it's
like to be a homeless teenage art-
ist, an 85-year-old slowly accept-
ing the inevitability of death or
a mother diagnosed with breast
cancer facing the loss of her femi-
ninity and sense of beauty.
Now, I almostrunderstand. This
year the Michigan Theatre is air-
ing the five nominated documen-
taries in two parts, dividing up a
program that would have lasted
almost four hours.
"Part A" began with "Kings
Point," a film that looked at elder-
ly people (mainly former New
Yorkers) who live in a Florida
retirement community, where
they act cranky and play mah-
jong. Although the premise seems
amusing, the film shows the lone-
liness and disconnection that
comes with old age.
This film harshly contradicts
the image of old people living itup
Florida, so often perpetuated in
advertising. (Apparently, retire-
ment ain't one big ol' party, Taco
Bell.) Instead, growing old with-
out your loved ones can be dismal
and lonely. "Kings" eloquently
proves the fine line between inde-
pendence and solitude.
Perhaps in an attempt to emo-
tionally'wttndlt e entire theater,
"Mondays at Racine" followed
"Kings," a look at women with
aggressive cancer as they lose
their hair, and with it some sense

of their own womanhood. It
chroniclesCynthia and Rachel,
sister hairdressers in Long Island,
who reserve one day every month
to give free beauty care to these
cancer sufferers.
Cancer stories are unfortu-
nately common in our society,
but -rarely do we get to see the
real pain and loss cancer suffer-
ers feel - what we get are stoic,
strong individuals heroically ris-
ing above their pain. "Mondays at
Racine" finds tragic beauty in the
real breakdowns of these women,
and its effects strike a cord.
I fortunately am not close
to anyone who has had cancer,
but watching Cambria, a young
mother of two, shave her head
was nothing short of sorrowful.
She isn't defiant. She doesn't tout
the overdone power anthems of
cancer victims. She quietly cries,
accepting her loss in a way that
transcends the "normal" cancer
conventions. This film does just
that, cuts away cancer tropes to
identify the core emotion of these
women.
"Part A" rounded out with "Ino-
cente," an intensely personal and
luminous look at a colorful, radi-
ant young artist (named Inocente),
who also happens to be homeless.
Her story is told through the can-
vasses of her fantastical and incan-
descent paintings.
This underdog tale is told with
careful fragility and weight,
focusing just as much on Ino-
cente's tragic past as her inspiring
future. The visuals are stunning,
contrasting the protagonist's
neon art and bright face with the
decrepit areas in which she is
forced to live. Tears are entirely
justified, as sas the resounding
applause that filled the audience
as Inocente's laughing face faded
from the screen.
"Part B" features two films,
"Redemption" and "Open Heart,"
both of which kept up with the
theme of showcasing the breadth
of human strength.
"Redemption" followed New
Yorkers (both native and immi-
grant) who, because of the econ-
omy and layoffs, are forced to
collect cans from the street in

order to make a living. The film
meanders, not identifying with
the canners until the second half,
when we see them all huddled
together at the redeemingsite - a
sad family of people better than
its current condition.
This film forces you to really
consider the value of money and
the useless things we buy. A two-
dollar cup of tea from Espresso
Royale is a bagful of 40 cans, an
hour of digging through gar-
bage. Though thought provok-
ing, "Redemption" is the bleakest
of the five, as it offers no hope of
improvement or any real redemp-
tion.
"Open Heart" seems the most
conventional of documentaries;
it follows Rwandan children as
they travel thousands of miles to
receive necessary heart surgeries.
Keywords: Africa, children, life-
threatening disease. But "Heart"
finds its own heart not in unfor-
tunate backstories, but in the sus-
penseful joy of discovering what
perils and successes follow these
endearing kids.
Thousands of kids in Africa are
diagnosed every year with rheu-
matic heart disease, an illness
that has' been eradicated from
most developed countries. Eight
of those afflicted'children are spe-
cifically chosen to fly 2,500 miles
from their villages in Rwanda to
the Salam Center in Sudan, the
only cardiovascular surgery hos-
pital on the continent.
There they undergo intensive
surgery, get a visit from Suda-
nese president (dictator) Omar
al-Bashir and easily win our
affections. "Open Heart" deftly
shows the pain that comes with
being a sick child and the harder
feelings of inadequacy being a
parent of that child, but it never
loses its hope or its joy.
These films are at times too
powerful; watching five heart-
breaking stories in succession
makes for an emotionally drain-
ing evening. However, they all
have something to say about the
human condition. These short
documentaries tell their messages
with simplicity and passion, so
that everyone can understand.

"She doesn't even go here.'
Foals fails to bring heat
on latest release ' Fire'

By KENDALL RUSS
Online Arts Editor
When Foals released its 2008
debut, Antidotes, to much fan-
fare, NME's review tested the
Oxford quin-
tet's buzz-wor-
thiness with
four lessons on Holy Fire
"How To Deal Foals
With Hype."
The final les- Transgressive
son went some-
thing like this:
"Make a really good album but
not a great one. Alert everyone
to your potential but don't ful-
fill it." And while Antidotes aced
that test, its 2010 follow-up, Total
Life Forever, ditched the insidi-
ous droning for more compelling
melodies to great effect.
But with its latest release,
Holy Fire, Foals falls short of the
admittedly lofty benchmark set
by its preceding work. Where
Total Life Forever seized the jar-
ring intensity of Antidotes and
harnessed it brilliantly, Holy Fire
is sedated in nearly every aspect.

The encouraging "Prelude" and
"Inhaler" - among the album's
sole highlights - quickly give
way to a convoluted and confused
body of work.
When frontman Yannis
Philippakis mockingly chanted a
Lacoste advertising slogan ("Un
peu d'air sur la terre") on Anti-
dotes opener "The French Open,"
the criticism of commercial
society was evident. He dumbs.

Number," though, delivering
a toothless track that's catchy
but inane. In place of biting and
intelligent social commentary,
Philippakis blandly rambles
about naive love for the better
part of Holy Fire. The uninspired
lyricism on Holy Fire's weakest
moments further manifests itself
through uncharacteristically
lethargic guitar play. The urgen-
cy that once made Foals so capti-
vating is nowhere to be found.
Indeed, Holy Fire contains
far too many insipid moments
to make it a memorable record.

of "Bad Habit" and the chill-

ing "Late Night," while decent,
amount to little more than poor
imitations of their Total Life For-
ever predecessors. "Everytime"
lacks the unsettling, nervous
tenacity of previous Foals, which,
again, would be fine if it packed
any punch at all.
Perhaps this notable absence
of panache stems from a severely
restricted Jack Bevan, whose
drowsy drumming acts as a poor
replacement for his typically
complex and unrelenting percus-
sion. Instead of thetightly wound
pulsing of Antidotes or the robust
funk of Total Life Forever, we get
a dull and unmotivated collec-
tion of elementary beats. By the
closing track, "Moon," Bevan
is entirely absent. Foals under-
standably would want to tweak
its sound on the third album, but
abandoning perhaps its strongest
quality to date as a focal point is
as incomprehensible as it's inef-
fective.
Scottish band
loses emotional
punch.
Despite the genuine quality of
"Inhaler" and "Milk & Black Spi-
ders," neither track suffiiently
supports the rest of Holy Fire's
dead weight. The latter pairs
a haunting guitar and Bevan's
(finally!) pounding percussion
with Philippakis's reverberating
vocals to brilliantly capture the
emotive longing Holy Fire all-too-
infrequently taps into. Where the
scintillating "Inhaler" bruises
and bullies, bringing the Foals
way forward with menace, the
band expands laterally on"Milk &
Black Spiders," incorporating an
eerie synth and a distinguishably
darker vibe. Unfortunately, such
lateral growth occurs sparingly, if
at all, across the album.
Holy Fire's fatal problem,
though, is the glaring absence of
any cogent, cohesive identity. It
features unexciting, gushy love
songs with spritely pop-infused
hooks; more sorrowful accounts
of distant and lost love; even
blaring and clumsy grunge with
no intelligible theme. Conclud-
ing with its two softest songs
after its loudest and most clut-
tered merely highlights the
album's thematic, lyrical and
musical disunity throughout.
The single criticism direct-
ed at Foals's angular, bizarre
debut centered on its obdurate
rigidity and its inaccessibility.
The band artfully addressed
these concerns on its follow-up,
exchanging the atonal chant-
ing for a fuller but often more
withdrawn sound. Holy Fire
struggles to strike that balance,
often going for far too much or
far too little. It results in a spo-
radic effort at best, and a con-
fused, defensive step backward,
at worst. With a self-assured
lyrical and vocal composure,
Philippakis dropped the bark
but still maintained the vicious
bite of Foals' debut on Total Life
Forever. Holy Fire hardly even
amounts to a growl.

Thompson leads 'M'

Forwards struggling in 'D' zone

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
The past few weeks have been a
series of ups and downs for Mich-
igan women's basketball senior
guard Kate Thompson. The all-
time program record holder for
3-pointers has led the team to
its best start in program history,
but the Wolverines will need her
deep ball now more than ever as
they head into the final stretch of
conference play.
The 6-foot-4 native of Plym-
outh, Minn. surely isn't the loud-
est player on the court, but her
sharpshooting does most of the
talking. Thompson's 15.3 points
per game and her 43.5 shooting
percentage from behind the arc
leads the entire Michigan roster.
It comes as no surprise,
then, that when Thompson hits
3-pointers, the Wolverines tend
to win games. But when she
struggles to find the bottom of
the net, Michigan (7-4 Big Ten,
18-6 overall) can't find offensive
consistency elsewhere. Prior to
Sunday's upset at Purdue, the
Wolverines had lost four of six

with Thompson's worst slump of
the year.
Against Penn State, Thompson
hit just 3 of 14 attempts from deep
in a losing effort. Though Michi-
gan bounced back with a vic-
tory at Indiana three days later,
Thompson continued to struggle,
and shot 3 of 9 from 3-point range.
A 1-for-5 shooting performance
against Iowa was followed by
her resilient effort in Minnesota
when she finished with 18 points
in the loss.
"I think in her mind, she shoots
from wherever," said senior guard
Nya Jordan. "Kate will shoot a
half-court 3-pointer and it will
go in, because she doesn't care
where she shoots it from. She has
so much confidence that she'll
shoot it wherever, whenever."
Thompson's past three games
have mimicked her team's roller-
coaster ride through conference
play. Michigan State's Klarissa
Bell locked down Thompson's
perimeter shooting and forced
her into making just two 3-point-
ers on 10 attempts. Though her
5-for-15 shooting clip against Illi-
nois wasn't efficient, Thompson's

to help Michigan preserve a
momentum-changing win.
"Sometimes when you are a
shooter and you don't shoot the
ball well, you become a little hesi-
tant," said Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico. "You are not shoot-
ing it with as much confidence,
and it is almost like you are trying
to force the ball to go in. I thought
she did that a few times in the Illi-
nois game when she was 5-for-16.
She made two late (3-pointers)
that she didn't even think about
because we needed her to make
them. I think her biggest thing
is that she cannot hesitate, and
she did a tremendous job (against
Purdue)."
With her 22-point perfor-
mance against the Boilermakers,
Thompson has now turned in two
straight Big Ten performances in
which she finished with double-
digit point totals. Purdue might
just be the game that sets Thomp-
son - and the Wolverines - back
on a winning track.
"I think that is a big thing as
a shooter, to know that we (the
team) have confidence in you and
you have the green light," Barnes

Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson has emphasized all
season that the players who earn
regular spots in the lineup will be
plus players.
Senior forward Lindsay
Sparks, who has played sporadi-
cally this year, hasn't seen his
name on the lineup chart since
Michigan's 5-1 loss to Bowling
Green on Jan. 8. Sparks finished
that game with a minus-four rat-
ing and was a major factor in one
of the Wolverines' worst defen-
sive performances of the year.
"I think our team is in desper-
ate need to play better hockey
defensively," Berenson said.
"That was a game where our
team got embarrassed by Bowl-
ing Green, and Lindsay was
one of the guys that we've had a
microscope on."
The defensive struggles have
been a problem for the entire
team, but Berenson isn't afraid
to point out specific players who
need improvement, and fast. He
also hasn't hesitated to sit players
who have been productive offen-
sively but fail to show up on the
defensive end. .I
And Berenson isn't only look-
ing for two-way players, but also
players who have some of the
intangibles - such as knowing
where to be on the ice or antici-
pating an opponent's next move.
Sometimes these intangibles
come instinctively, but if they
don't, practice and repetition
become that much more impor-
tant.
"Lindsay has got to play bet-
ter without the puck," Beren-
son said. "If he plays well with
the puck that's a bonus, but in
the meantime, he can't hurt us
defensively. (The Bowling Green
game) was a nightmare night for

NCAA Championships, won the
200-yard medley relay and placed
third in the 200-yard butterfly at
the Big Ten Championship and
posted multiple first-place finishes
in meets throughout the year.
According to this progres-
sion, this year was supposed to be
Wojciechowski's breakout season
- though things haven't exactly
gone to plan.
"I had hernia surgery (during
the offseason) and was out for
about two months," Wojciechows-

back into shape from that, I broke
my foot. I remember the practices
were really brutal and I would
always not be able to finish the
workouts."

Swimming is a sport that's reg-
ularly decided by the slimmest of
margins. The smallest details dis-
tinguish winners from losers. It's
a sport where you cannot afford to
give your opponent an advantage
of even an inch, let alone a healthy
foot.
"I went to meets with my foot
broken and wasn't swimming
nearly as well as I was the pre-
vious year at the same meet,"
Wojciechowski said. "It was frus-
trating but somehow I used that as
an opportunity to work on aspects
of my swimming that I could still
do with my broken foot and it
ended up making my kicks stron-
ger, and I think I actually grew
from these injuries."
With injuries behind him,.

Wojciechowski is looking to make
the best out of the remainder of
the season. And judging by recent
performances against Big Ten
rivals Ohio and Michigan State,
where he finished in first place in
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly to
go along with a 400-yard medley
relay win, and set a pool record in
the 100-yard butterfly, respective-

for this season.
"This is myjunior year.Iwant to
step up as a leader," Wojciechows-

lead by your actions, what you say,

He's really just trying to make a
name for himself, but with a name
that nobody else can pronunce.

Q&A with MSU juniors

Sophomore pointguard Trey Burke will be tasked with another tough matchup in Spartan Keith Appling.
Michigan travels

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
For the first time since the
Fab Five roamed the Ann Arbor
streets, the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team seems to have a leg
up, or at least be on par with its
in-state rival, Michigan State.
Just 60 miles separate the two
top-10 teams, and with a pair of
the nation's top coaches - Mich-
igan's John
Beilein and B I
Michigan
State's Tom
Izzo - both
programs
should be
perennial contenders for years
to come.
The Spartans, tied with Indi-
ana atop the Big Ten standings,
hold a one-game lead over the
Wolverines, making Tuesday
night's tussle inside the Breslin
Center even more important.
Tensions should be high come
9 p.m. in East Lansing, and two
Spartans - center Adrelan
Payne and guard Keith Appling
- have experienced the intensity
of the rivalry over the course of
their past two years on campus.
After Michigan swept the Spar-
tans in the juniors' freshmen
seasons, the programs split last
year's contests. Payne, an Ohio
native, and Appling, a Michigan
native, should know a fair share
about this rivalry, right?
The Daily sat down with the
players at Big Ten Media Day in
October to find out.
The Michigan Daily: What did
you learn from rooming with
someone like Draymond Green?
(Green, one of Michigan State's
most heralded athletes of all
time, graduated last year and is
now playing for the NBA's Gold-
en State Warriors.)
Adreian Payne: I just learned
more of, you can say, things off
the court. You know, paying bills

on time, things like that. Just
life-learning lessons you will
take with you every day.
TMD: (Senior center Derrick
Nix) went through that legal
stuff at the beginning of the off-
season. (Nix was arrested, jailed
and pled guilty to two counts of
drug possession). Do you think
that helped him because now
he's a captain? Do you think that
helped shaped the leader that
he's turned into?
AP: I think that that helped
him a lot as far as sometimes
maybe you've gotta get knocked
down, you know, hit rock bottom.
before you realize that you have
to change and learn that people
look up to you and things like
that. I think that opened his eyes.
TMD: Growing up in Ohio,
was it easy for you to come here
and hate Michigan?
AP: Growing up in Ohio, I
never really watched basketball,
so I really never had rivalries or
anything big on Michigan or not.
Just coming up here and going to
Michigan State, it informed me
to have a rivalry against Michi-
gan. I didn't grow up in the fam-
ily atmosphere and the tradition
of Michigan State. Coach Izzo
has grown on me, so it's kind of
hard not to have that rivalry.
TMD: What's itegoing to be like
this year, with both teams being
top-15 preseason teams, because
that's not something that's hap-
pened recently?
AP: We really don't focus on
that, butwe'll come outevery day
and use it for fuel and just go out
and play hard every day.
TMD: What do you remem-
ber about last year's two games
against Michigan?
AP: You know, I don't really
want to talk about that.
TMD: Michigan State might
be flying a little more under the
radar than normal. Does that put
a chip on your shoulder?
Keith Appling: I wouldn't say

so because last year we flew
under the radar tremendously
and we were able to win the Big
Ten championship, so that's not
really one of the things we worry
about.
TMD: Draymond was the face
of Michigan State basketball, and
now Izzo's'been pointing at you a
lot. Do you feel any pressure to
fill his shoes, even a little bit?
KA: I don't feel pressure at
all because, at the end of the
day, this is what I signed up for.
I've just got to be prepared to do
whatever I can to help my team
win and be successful in the Big
Ten.
TMD: You grew up in Michi-
gan. Is this the best you ever
remember Michigan and Michi-
gan State being at the same time?
KA: (Laughter) Yeah, because
there's a lot of talent on both
teams, so when we step out on
that floor, it's going to be blood,
sweat and tears. I'm pretty sure
it's going to be a hard-fought
game.
TMD: What do you remember
about the two games last year?
KA: I remember they were
some hard-fought games. The
one in Ann Arbor, it was a tough
one. They played hard, we played
hard, it was a back-and-forth
game throughout the whole 40
minutes, but they were able to
come out with the win because
they werethe better team onthat
given night. But in the Breslin
(Center), we were kind of able to
repay them a little bit. It was fun,
that's what it's all about.
TMD: Do you have many fam-
ily members who are Michigan
fans who get in your ear around
that time?
KA: Nah, not really. Even if
they were Michigan fans, now
that I'm Michigan State, they're
Michigan State. They don't real-
ly bother me too much in the sea-
son anyway, so that's not one of
the things I have to worry about.

to East

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
The stakes have never been this
high for a mid-February rivalry
game.
The Wolverines (8-3 Big Ten,
21-3 overall) and the Spartans
(9-2, 20-4) have faced off 169
times in the rivalry's history, and
just nine of those matchups have
come when both teams were in
the Top 25. And until Tuesday's
game, both teams have never both
been ranked in the Associated
Press' top 10.
Though rankings don't have
significant implications at this
pointin the season - there's stilla
month left in the regular season -
the matchup in East Lansing has
more substance than who stays in
the top 10 at the end of the week.
"It's the Big Ten title on the
line," said sophomore guard Trey
Burke. "Two top-10 teams going at
it, and Michigan-Michigan State
(is) one of the biggest rivalries in
college basketball."
Tuesday'sgamewill alsodecide
whether or not Michigan will
regain control of its destiny on the
road to the Big Ten regular-season
title. Currently,Indiana and Mich-
igan State sit in first place at 9-2 in
conference play, with Michigan
and Wisconsin in second place at
8-3. All year, Big Ten coaches have
stressed the depth and strength of
the conference and predicted that
the eventual champion wouldn't
come away with fewer than four
conference losses.
The tough conference slate
hasn't been kind to the Wolver-
ines. Michigan has dropped two
of its past three games - both
on the road - and has faced two
ranked opponents in the past 10
days. Though Michigan coach
John Beilein doesn't like to point
out certain games as "must-wins,"
a road victory tonight would put
them in better shape towards the
ultimate goal of a Big Ten title.

Women's soccer inks seven

By ALEJANDRO ZON&IGA
DailySports Writer
The Michigan women's soccer
team enjoyed its most success-
ful season in almost a decade in
2012, taking first-seeded Penn
State to a penalty kick shootout
before bowing out of the NCAA
Tournament's Sweet 16. With one
of the most experienced coaching
staffs in the country and a loaded
recruiting class joining the pro-
gram this fall, the Wolverines
might experience even better
results in the near future.
On Monday, Michigan coach
Greg Ryan announced that seven
players had signed National Let-
ters of Intent for the 2013 season:
Taylor Bucklin, Bailey Haydock,
Jessica Heifetz, Missy Kreutz,
Madi Lewis, Anna Soccorsi and
Nicky Waldeck. The incoming
class will add to a roster that lost
just three seniors to graduation.
"We're very excited about this
class of signees," Ryan said in a
statement. "Each member of this
class is extremely talented and
plays the game of soccer at a very

high level. We expect them to
make an immediate and positive
impact on our team this season
and add to the culture that we've
created here at the University of
Michigan."
Taylor Bucklin could help
address the graduation of Haley
Kopmeyer, the program's most
successful goalkeeper. Kopmey-
er recorded more saves (383),
shutouts (27) and had the lowest.
goals-against average (0.96) than
any other netminder in Michigan
history. The Wolverines' roster
already features two goalkeep-
ers, sophomore Maddie Clarfield
and junior Zaryn Jennings, but
Bucklin has showcased her tal-
ents for the Canadian national
team at the CONCACAF Under-
17 Women's Championship and
the Under-17 Women's World
Cup.
The seven signees also include
a total of four defenders and
midfielders who will reinforce a
defense that allowed just 17 goals
and recorded 13 shutouts in 2012
- both program bests. The back
line is anchored by senior She-

lina Zadorski, who was recent-
ly called up to the Canadian
national team. The Wolverines
also picked up Virginia transfer
and Troy, Mich. native Olivia
Brannon on Jan. 9 - one of the
nation's top defenders.
Michigan had enjoyed a peri-
od of success when it made the
NCAA Tournament every year
between 1997 and 2004, but has
only danced three times since
then. When Debbie Rademacher
- the program's longtime coach
- resigned in 2007, the Wolver-
ines hired Ryan and associate
coach Dean Duerst to replace her.
When Ryan and Duerst arrived
in Ann Arbor, they had very little
with which to impress recruits.
The team didn't have a practice
field and even played some games
at Canton High School. But after
several delays, the UM Soccer
Complex was completed in 2010,
and Zadorsky and standout for-
ward Nkem Ezurike enrolled that
year. Since then, the coaches and
facilities have consistently drawn
strong recruiting classes and the
team has continued to improve.
