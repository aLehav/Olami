Museum of Art Director James
Steward's 'town hall for the
arts' opens to students tonight.

By BEN VANWAGONER
Daily Fine Arts Editor
After two-and-a-half years and
$41.9 million worth of renovation
and expansion, University stu-
dents will finally get a glimpse of
the University of Michigan Muse-
um of Art's long-awaited make-
over tonight.
The length of construction
means that for many students on
campus, this evening's preview
will be their first chance to expe-
rience the museum, which houses
more than 18,000 works of art and
is now more than double its previ-
ous size.
During a walkthrough of
the museum yesterday, UMMA
Director.James Steward's rueful
grimace made it clear that he real-
ized this all too well.
"How many of you were in the
museum before (the expansion)?"
he asked Daily staff on a tour yes-
terday. "Probably not many."
The Museum's doors will be
open tonight from 8 p.m. until
midnight. Planned exclusively
with students in mind, the pre-
view features two DJs and Ann
Arbor band The Great Divide, who
will perform amid the oil paint-
ings and sculpture of the Europe-
an and American art gallery.
Most events will be occurring
in the Apse - a wide-open, col-
umned space in the middle of the
old wing - butevery gallery in the
newly expanded museum is open
for exploration.

UMMA PREVIEW
WHAT: A free preview of the Art
Museum open to all University of,
Michigan students.
WHEN: Tonight from 8 p.m. until
midnight.
WHY: Live entertainment, free
food and a chance to explore the
building before it opens.
Steward emphasized that con-
necting with students is one of the.
Museum's major goals, and many
of the features of the new section
- officially the Frankel Wing -
are designed to enable that.
The purpose of the expansion
is to create what Steward calls a
. "town hall for the arts" by bring-
ing students, faculty and com-
munity into direct, unmediated
contact with art and with each
other.
"We want it to be like the Diag,"
Steward said.
He places the Museum among
older traditions of collaboration
and exchange with suitably high
hopes.
"Think of the marketplace in
Athens," Steward said. "It wasn't
just a marketplace - it was also
whereSocratic dialoguetook place,
where ideas were exchanged."
The space in the old wing has
been vastly modified to bring visi-
tors closer to the art. Whole ceilings
have been redone, and new skylights

In an announcement made at a
staff meeting yesterday morning,
Laurel Champion, publisher of The
Ann Arbor News, told employees
that the newspaper plans to close its
doors and stop publishing in July.
In an interview yesterday, Cham-
pion said she and a few key execu-
tives learned of the newspaper's
decision to close about one month
ago, but that most Ann Arbor News
employees heard the announce-
ment for the first time yesterday.
Champion said a marked decline
in advertising revenue - with Jan-
pary advertising sales figures down
20 percent from last year - largely
contributed to the newspaper's

financial challenges.
"We had very serious losses last
year and those losses declined even
more in the past months," she said.
The Ann Arbor News - owned
by parent company Booth Newspa-
pers - will be replaced by AnnAr-
bor.com, a website that will publish
local news online.
The News will continue to pub-
lish its daily content on Mlive.com
in the interim.
AnnArbor.com, owned by Web-
based media company AnnArbor.
com LLC, is expected to begin
operations later this year and has
plans to circulate a print edition on
Sundays and Thursdays.

vice president of the new company,

The hole in Ann
Arbor's local news

By MATT AARONSON
Daily StaffReporter
Yesterday's announcement of
the end of The Ann Arbor News is
yet another dark cloud in the ever-
worsening landscape of print jour-
nalism in this country.
All across the country, news-
papers are switching to an online
format, cutting down on staff and
content, filing for bankruptcy and
even going under. Though 15,704
people lost a job at a newspaper in
2008, and over 6,000 have already
lost their jobs this year, accord-'
ing to Paper Cuts, a website that
tracks layoffs, buyouts and news
in the U.S. newspaper industry,
some local experts have begun to

speculate that the Ann Arbor's
tech-savvy community could make
for a smooth transition to a strictly
online news outlet.
"Many people think that we're
experiencing a slow but quicken-
ing death spiral of the newspaper
industry," said Michael Traugott,
chair of the University's Commu-
nications Department, in an inter-
view yesterday.
"So who is going to keep an eye
from a news perspective on devel-
opers, the University of Michigan,
certain kinds of businesses as well
as the political machinery in local
government?" he said.

Arbor Chronicle, a local, online news

THE DIGITAL PRESS
SU' will merge publishing
operations with the library

0 Combined effort
will update the way
the University Press
prints its books
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
University officials announced
plans on Friday to merge the Uni-
versity of Michigan Press with the
University Library in an effort to
reinforce the University's mission
of efficiently publishing scholarly
texts while transitioning into the
digital age.
The announcement came
* approximately one month after
the Association of American Uni-
versities and the Association of
Research Libraries issued a call to
action urging universities to take a
more active role in producing and

sharing academic works through
digital technologies.
Under the new plan, Dean of
Libraries Paul Courant will over-
see the University of Michigan
Press.
Philip Pochoda, director of the
University of Michigan Press, said
the library is a natural partner for
the University Press and that the
change will place the publishing
house at the center of the Univer-
sity's digitization efforts.
The move will signal a major
change for the University of Mich-
igan Press, Pochoda said. The Uni-
versity of Michigan Press will now
digitize scholarly books and only
print them once an order has been
placed.
The conventional method of a
publishing house involves print-
ing a certain number of copies of
a book and storing the copies in a
warehouse until orders are placed,
Pochoda said. The University of

Michigan Press's new model will,
therefore, avoid printing more
copies than necessary and reduce
physical storage costs.
Pochodasaiddespitethis, some
areas of the University of Michi-
gan Press will not be affected.
He said books published for the
general reader, including books
on the Great Lakes and issues
of public concern like personal
health or poverty will continue
to be published under the cur-
rent model.
Pochoda said the reorganization
will better align the University of
Michigan Press with the'goals of
the University asa whole.
"(It will) allow us to connect
to the central mission of the Uni-
versity," he said. "(The move)
puts us into being a part of the
academic mission of the Univer-
sity."
The move, Pochoda said, will

Underneath the Student Activi-
ties Building, down a flight of stairs
and at the end of a long hallway, is
the student-run WCBN radio sta-
tion where radio show host arwulf
arwulf broadcasts every week at
88.3 megahertz.
arwulf is a University lecture hall
projectionist who moved to Ann
Arbor in the summer of 1968 at the
age of 1.
A self-proclaimed autodidact,
whichmeansheisself-taught, arwulf
has let this approach toward learning
become a philosophy of sorts.
Born Theodore Grenier, arwulf
said his adopted name found him at
the age of 13. While on a walk with
friends, arwulf said the moon cast
a shadow and his friends told him
he looked like a wolf howling at the
moon.
In addition to his radio show at
the University, arwulf hosts The
Sunday Best on Eastern Michigan
University's radio station WEMU

and writes music reviews on allmu-
sicguide.com.
Despite his many interests,
arwulf said his real passion lies in
radio and music.
"I want to be there to alleviate suf-
fering," arwulf said. "That's the main
body of work."
arwulf's play lists for his Thursday
show have an eclectic range while his
Sunday show focuses more on jazz
and blues tracks.
He said he enjoys experimenting
with different types of formats on his
radio show.
"Every format is worth appreciat-
ing," he said. "We could learn from
formats to get along. We could learn
equality from formats. If all formats
are created equal, maybe we could
then rub off on the human race. I'm
not sure. It's worth a try."
In his many years living around
the University, arwulf has witnessed
changes in the student body and in
Ann Arbor.

LANSING Cdeb b r
5 5percentpaycut kills 23 in blast
for state emnlovees

proposed yesterday in Irag i

Republicans in the Michigan
House yesterday called for a 5
percent pay cut for state employ-
ees and a 5 percent cut to state
departments to help address a
growing deficit in this year's
budget.
GOP leaders said state gov-
ernment is spending $5 million
more each business day than
is being collected in tax rev-
enue. A plan proposed yesterday
would cut salaries 5 percent for
52,000 state workers, make state
employees and retirees pay high-
er health care premiums, and
reduce spending by 5 percent
across the board in state depart-
ments.
"It is time to bring state gov-
ernmentin line withthe econom-
ic realities of the private sector,"
said House Minority Leader
Kevin Elsenheimer, R-Kewadin.
WASHINGTON
Investigation opens
more possibilities
for plane crash
Speculation over the crash of
a single-engine turboprop plane
into a cemetery shifted to ice
on the wings yesterday after it
became less likely that overload-
ing was to blame, given that half
of the 14 people on board were
small children.
While descending Sunday in
preparation for landing at the
Bert Mooney Airport in Butte,
Mont., the plane passed through
a layer of air at about 1,500 feet
that was conducive to icing
because the temperatures were
below freezing and the air "had
100 percent relative humidity
or was saturated," according to
AccuWeather.com, a forecasting
service in State College, Pa.
Safety experts said similar
icing condition existed when a

turboprop crashed into a home

Legislators consider
apology for slavery
Connecticut legislators are
considering making their state
the first in New England to apol-
ogize for slavery and other racist
policies of old.
A legislative committee heard
* testimony yesterday on a resolu-
tion that would issue a formal,
general apology and express the
General Assembly's "profound
contrition" for the official acts
that sanctioned and perpetuated
slavery hundreds of years ago.
The state's African-American
Affairs Commission, a liaison
between black communities and
the government, is urging leg-
islators to pass the resolution,
which ithas called "an exercise in
reconciliation" and not an effort
to determine fault for slavery.

Concerns raised over
possible resurgence
of violence in Iraq
BAGHDAD (AP) - A suicide
bomber struck a tentfilled yester-
day with Kurdish funeral mourn-
ers, unleashing a huge fireball
that killed at least 23 people in a
northern town where Kurds and
Arabs are competing for power.
Also yesterday, Turkey's visiting
president pressed the Iraqi gov-
ernment to crack down on Kurd-
ish rebels who stage cross-border
raids into Turkish territory from
sanctuaries in northern Iraq.
The provincial security office
said 23 people were killed and 34
wounded in the suicide attack in
the town of Jalula some 80 miles
(120 kilometers) northeast of
Baghdad.
A member of the provincial
security committee, Amir Rifaat,
said 24 people were killed and 28
wounded. The difference could
not be immediately reconciled.
Karim Khudadat, whose
father was being mourned, said
he was receiving visitors when
the bomber struck.
"I was with my relatives out-
side the tent receiving people
who came to offer condolences
when suddenly the explosion took
place," Khudadat said. "Suddenly
a huge flame engulfed the tent
and I was wounded in my head
and legs."

capital
Elsewhere, eight people were
killed and 10 wounded in a bomb-
ing near a bus stop west of Bagh-
dad, and a policeman died and
eight people were wounded in a
suicide blast at a market in the
northern town of Tal Afar.
A series of high-profile bomb-
ings this month has raised concern
that insurgents may be regrouping
as the U.S. begins to scale down
combat operations and hand over
security responsibility to the Iraqis
ahead of a planned American troop
withdrawal by the end of 2011.
The attack in Jalula was note-
worthy because it points to ris-
ing tensions in the north between
Kurds and Arabs over control of a
swath of territory that the Kurds
want to incorporate into their self-
ruled region.
U.S. officials believe Kurdish-
Arab tension is among the major
flashpoint issues threatening Iraqi
stability now that the threat posed
by Sunni and Shiite insurgents has
been diminished.
Last August a suicide bomber
killed 25 people, mostly police
volunteers, in Jalula, a predomi-
nantly Arab town where the Iraqi
army forced out Kurdish fighters
of the self-ruled Kurdish govern-
ment last year after a standoff that
U.S. officials feared would lead to
armed conflict.
A Jalula resident who was
wounded in Monday's blast blamed
al-Qaida in Iraq, a Sunni Arab orga-
nization that typically carries out
suicide bombings.

Stocks soar after new a
-mortgage purchase plan

Plan would purchase
nearly $1 trillion in
bad mortgages
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration aimed
squarely at the crisis clogging the
nation's credit system yesterday
with a plan to take over up to $1
trillion in sour mortgage securities
with the help of private investors.
For once, Wall Street cheered.
The announcement, closely
stage-managed throughout the day,
filled in crucialblanksinthe admin-
istration's financial rescue package
and formed what President Barack
Obama called "one more critical
element in our recovery."
The coordinated effort by the
Treasury Department, the Federal
Reserve and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. relies on a mix of
government and private money -
mostly from institutional investors
such as hedge funds - to help banks
rid their balance sheets of real-
estate related securities thatare now.

extremely difficult to value..
The goal, said Obama, is to get
banks lending again, so "families
can get basic consumer loans, auto
loans, student loans, (and so) that
small businesses are able to finance
themselves, and we can start get-
ting this economy moving again."
It was a huge gambit and one that
came like a tonic to Wall Street,
whichhad pannedanearlier outline
of the program that lacked detail.
Stocks soared, the Dow Jones
industrial average shooting up
nearly 500 points, thanks to the
bank-assets plan and a report
showing an unexpected jump in
home sales.
The introduction of the plan was
closely choreographed so that the
president - rather than Treasury
Secretary TimothyGeithner --would
be the first administration official to
appear on camera at midday to dis-
cuss it. Geithner met earlier in the
day, before markets opened, with a
group of reporters at the Treasury
Department to go over specifics. But
cameras and broadcast-quality audio
recorders were barred.

It was the reverse of what hap-
pened Feb. 10. Then, after Obama
had helped raise expectations
toward Geithner and the plan, the
treasury secretary went before
cameras and bombed, The. Dow
plunged about 300 points amid
investor confusion about details.
The fleshed-out plan is designed
to help fix a value on damaged
mortgage loans and other toxic
securities.
If the value of the securities
goes up, the private investors and
taxpayers would share inthegains.
If the values go down, the govern-
ment and private investors would
incur losses.
"This will help banks clean up
their balance sheets and make it
easier for them to raise capital,"
Geithner said.
The plan will take $75 billion to
$100 billion from the government's
existing $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Program. The govern-
ment will pair this with private
investments and loans from the
FDIC and the Fed to generate $500
billion in purchasing power.

KHARTOUM (AP) - Sudan's
president traveled to Eritrea yes-
terday, choosing one of Africa's
most politically isolated nations for
his first trip abroad since an inter-
national court sought his arrest on
charges of war crimes in Darfur.
The one-day visit followed Eri-
trea's official invitation to Sudan's
Omar al-Bashir, who faces the
arrest warrant by the Nether-
lands-based International Crimi-
nal Court.
Eritrean television showed
live coverage of al-Bashir being
greeted at the airport in the Eri-
trean capital Asmara by his coun-
terpart President Isaias Afwerki;
along with drummers and danc-
ers. Sudanese state television later
yesterday showed live images of al-
Bashir returning to Khartoum.
SudaneseForeignMinisterDeng
Alor said the visit was "important"
and reflected Eritrean "solidar-
ity ... with Sudan against the ICC."

Eritrean Information Minister Ali
Abdu told The Associated Press that
al-Bashirwas accompaniedbyheads
of security and intelligence and was
there to discuss regional security, ...
The ICC charged al-Bashir on
March 4 of leading a counterinsur-
gency against Darfur rebels that
involved rapes, killings and other
atrocities against civilians. His
government has been accused of
unleashing Arab militiamen known
as janjaweed against Darfur civil-
ians in a drive to put down a revolt
by ethnic Africans in the region.
Up to 300,000 people have died
and 2.7 million driven from their
homes in the conflict since 2003,
according to the U.N.
Under the ICC charter, member
states are bound to arrest those
indicted when they enter their ter-
ritory. Eritrea is not a signatory,
however, and has vehemently con-
demned the indictment, making it
a kind of safe haven for el-Bashir to
visit.
"It's unjustifiable and illegal and
illogical and futile, the so-called
ICC decision," said Abdu. "We
believe it's an extension and symp-
tom of the ongoing world hegemony
and domination by a few powers in
this world."

FROM TH E DAILY
The cost of coverage
Universal health care would make system more affordable
hile many University students wait in fear of another
tuition hike, faculty members took the first financial
hit last week.. On Friday, the University announced
that faculty and retirees on University health plans will have to
pay a higher proportion of the costs. Though this will be a tough
increase for faculty, the University wasn't left with much of a
choice. Burdensome health care costs are a national problem, and
institutions like the University shouldn't be responsible for them.
Instead, the federal government needs to create a universal health
care system that provides for the medical needs of all people - a
reform that eases the financial burden many organizations like
ours are carrying.

According to University officials, health
care is the most rapidly increasing cost on
the University's budget. That's one reason
why faculty members will soon be paying
30 percent of their total health care costs
under a new plan - a considerable increase
over the current 20 percent. The commit-
tees that created the plan, the Committee
on Sustainable Health Benefits and the
Committee to Study Retirement Savings
Plan vesting Options, opted to increase
faculty contributions, rather than scrap
benefits.
With the University facing rising costs
and state funding cuts from the state,
something had to give. Failure to cut costs
could harm other priorities like the need
to keep tuition low. These costs are clearly
draining money that should be available
for other things.
And the University isn't the only one hurt-
ing -burgeoninghealth care costs are partly
to blame for the financial woes of Michigan's
auto makers. The best solution to the prob-
lems is federally managed universal health
care. This would alleviate health costs that
employers shouldn't have to worry about.
The rising cost of health care is a national
issue that shouldn't be left to individuals,
employers and schools to solve.
The government is better equipped to

address escalating costs and also has a
duty to provide such services to all people.
A national health care plan would reduce
the cost of health care because private
plans that already exist would have to offer
lower prices to compete. This would in
turn drive down costs for institutions like
the University.
With the cost of health care decreas-
ing from the creation of a national system,
more people will be able to afford coverage.
opponents of universal health care might
claim that a universal policy will lower
the quality of care or result in abuse of the
system, but this shouldn't be the case in a
well-managed program. Universal health
care is the best solution to the inequalities
created under current health care policies.
Colleges shouldn't have to struggle with
raising tuition or charging faculty mem-
bers through the roof for services that
their lives cpuld literally depend on. Edu-
cators and other individuals aren't respon-
sible for the problems in private health
care systems - they shouldn't have to pay
the price for the problem. And the federal
government can't shirk its responsibility to
make high quality health care accessible to
everyone. It's time for Congress to make
efficient, affordable health coverage a real-
ity for all Americans.

Today is World TB Day, when countries around the
world focus on the problem of tuberculosis, a disease that
still kills about 1.7 million people per year. This year, World
TB Day falls at a time of financial uncertainty and fear for
the future of our economy. During this period of financial
crisis for even the richest countries in the world, we in the
United States may be tempted to turn inward and look only
at our own needs and problems. Of course we must find ways
to help American families that have lost their homes and
American workers who have lost their jobs. But at the same
time, we should not overlook our global family for the sake
of our security. Just a little attenition and help can enhance
national security while simultaneously upholding the dig-
nity oftour fellow human beings.
Typical TB can be treated with a cheap six-month pro-
gram of two or three medications, but the increasingly
common, multi-drug-resistant TB can cost millions of
dollars to treat. Nearly 500,000 people around the world
developed MDR-TB last year. Even more threatening is
extensively drug-resistant TB, which has a mortality rate
of 85 percent and has been found in 35 countries, includ-
ing the United States. As we learned last year through the
case of Andrew Speaker, those with TB in one country
can spread the disease easily in a closed area, like in an
airplane. Now that global travel is so commonplace, TB in
one country threatens all of us.
Currently, the United States provides funding for TB
programs primarily through the Global Fund to Fight
AIDS, TB, and Malaria. This fund, which is financed
through contributions from avariety of wealthy countries,
solicits grant proposals for health programs in poorer
nations to combat these deadly diseases. If the proposals

are deemed worthy by an independent technical review
panel, the Global Fund grants the money to launch and
sustain these programs. Since its inception, the Fund has
disbursed $7.2 billion for programs that have saved an
estimated 3.5 million lives.
In 2007, leaders at the Global Fund Board and G8
agreed to scale yearly contributions to the Global Fund
up to between $6-8 billion if countries crafted high-qual-
ity grant proposals. This encouraged a dramatic increase
in the number and scale of proposals submitted, and
the Global Fund agreed to increase yearly funding. But
G8 countries have not lived up to their commitments to
increase contributions to the Fund yet and consequently
many worthy projects still can't obtain funding. If these
projects stall, it could lead to lost lives and an increased
likelihood that TB will spread to more countries.
Congress and the President have a chance to remedy
this situation by increasing funding for the Global Fund
in the coming supplemental appropriations bill. Our fair *
share of the financial need of the Global Fund is $2.7 bil-
lion. Compared to the trillions that we have poured into
our irresponsible banks, this sum seems like pennies, and
this money could actually provide a return on investment.
Please contact your legislators and ask them to fight for
full funding for the Global Fund. If you are unsure about
who your legislator is, feel free to contact Lisa Treumuth
(lmtreu@umich.edu) and Joshua Lee (msnbc@umich. *
edu) to receive that information. Millions of lives could
depend on it - maybe.
Joshua Lee is a Business sophomore and
Lisa Treumuth is a graduate student.

Playing for keeps

Sp endid 'Hazards'

It's a bummer that Michigan was cured
of its March Madness. To top it off, that
hockey game on Saturday blew, and let's
not forget that crazy Rich Rod. Blue athletics
can be distressing these
days, but I have a working
form of athletic alleviation.
I cherish sports movies
- when you watch them,
not only can you can pick
your plays, but you can
watch true drama. Sports
movies are real, brutal, BLAKE
insightful, poetic and awe- GOBLE
inspiring. Sports are dra-
matic; plain and simple.
That's why I'm here to present to you the
finest sports films of all time. Who am I to
make such bold claims? First, being a former
athlete - pre-paunch, I participated in varsity
swimming and water polo - I can say I know
how sports films connect. I've screened loads
of these flicks. And like any sport, I have rules.
Rule one: No Kevin Costner films. Rule two:
No boxing films. Rule three: "Hoosiers" is dis-
qualified, because it had the same director as
"Rudy." And rule 4: A sport can only present
itself once, meaning no two baseball or basket-
ball films. Don't like the rules? Tough. I don't
have to justify them. So without further adieu,
let's get it on.
"The Hustler" was unglamorous, yet ultra
hip. Paul Newman plays "Fast" Eddie Felson,
the most bodacious billiards man you'll ever
see. "Hustler" gets the nod because of New-
man's iconic portrayal of a man trapped by
his talents.
Speaking of talent, "This Sporting Life" is
the most emotional piece on this list. If you
haven't seen Richard Harris ("Camelot")
give a total performance in this kitchen-sink
drama about the trials of gifted rugby player
Frank Machin, you must see this movie.
But even without revealing harsh realities,
sports can be beautiful. Yes, there's a tainted
quality to Leni Riefenstahl's "Olympia" films
about the 1936 Berlin Olympics - juxtapos-
ing Jesse Owens with Adolph Hitler is too
awkward to ignore. But Leni was the first and
best filmmaker to understand the beauty of
the physical form and she showed it with slow
motion, low-angle athletes in fluid form.
The filthiest, funniest and most furious
film here, "Slap Shot" is raw athletics. Look up
the fashion show scene online. But as a sports

story, it is a great dramedy, capturing the
unexpected in the best way possible. Oh, and
the Hanson brothers are the funniest perpe-
trators of sports violence you'll ever see.
Then there's the original "Bad News Bears,"
the most accurate depiction of youth sports.
Argue hard about "Sandlot" capturing your
youth, but "Bears" is way more honest. Who
didn't razz on other teams? Just look up "Bad
News Bears Tanner" on YouTube for proof.
Kids are cruel, but funny too. I certainly earned
my water poloblack eyes and stitches at 16.
That's not to say sports can't imbue hope.
Sports will always inspire. Granted, the Dis-
ney sports movie formula has been packaged
and resold just like the worst junk food. But
"Remember the Titans" was the first in Dis-
ney's recent string of athletic dramas, and it's
I just hate 'Field
of Dreams'!
still the greatest. You really do want Denzel
Washington to be your coach. And for once it's
OK to win a game.
So what are arguably the two best sports
film ever made? The first is Roger Ebert's pick
for best film of the 1990s. As the most compre-
hensive movie on sports, "Hoop Dreams" is
incendiary. It's a three-hour documentary on
two teenage Chicago basketball players, and
it never lets up. Witness the heart-breaking,
spirit-lifting experience of their quest to
someday play in the NBA. It's a landmark.
However, without apology, I believe
"Breaking Away" is the perfect sports movie.
Funny, fast, pretty and completely involving,
it's ekactly right. Four townies at the Univer-
sity of Indiana compete against locals, and
that's it. But there's much beneath the surface.
"Breaking Away" is about finding and chal-
lenging yourself, and about uncorrupted com-
petition. We learn from, enjoy and take part in
this experience as it connects with us all. This
is all that is good in sport and film.
These are the sports movies that get it. And
I hate "Field of Dreams."

An ambitious opera,
The Decemberists' new
LP beats expectations
By JEFF SANFORD
Daily Arts Writer
So The Decemberists have made a
17-track indie-opera.
It's a necessary label,

is touted as any type
of "opera," it's nor- DeCemlbeists

incoherent mess. It'soThe
simply too difficult of Love
for most bands to Capitol
strike that delicate
halance between pretension, ambition
and actual musical quality when mak-
ing these beefed-up concept albums.
But it goes without saying that The
Decemberists are not a typical band.
Colin Meloy, the group's bookish front-
man, is well knownfor his peculiar fond-
ness for arcane and obscure vocabulary
(a sample line from 2006's The Crane
Wife: "Its contents watched by Sycorax
/ and Patagon in parallax"). Guitarist
Chris Funk once battled Stephen Col-
bert in a guitar duel on live television.
They're weird dudes. Maybe that's why
they were able to turn out a rock-, indie-
or whatever-opera that's both musically
and thematically compelling.
Conceptually, Hazards of Love is a
sylvan fairytale describing an evil tree-
queen and a fair maiden named Marga-
ret who (I'm fairly sure) gets raped by
a morphing fawn and kidnapped. Natu-
rally, her lover seeks revenge.
Needless to say, it's a strange album.
But coming from Meloy and his merry
band of troubadours, it all fits into place.
The story is told not only coherently but
poetically - here's Meloy describing
Margaret's abduction: "All a'gallop with
Margaret slung roof crossed withers /
Having clamped her innocent fingers
in fetters / This villain must calculate
crossing the wild river."

"We shot 782 pounds of game, but were only able to carry 200 back to our wagoe.

In less capable hands, an album like
this could be disastrous. It's grandiose.
It's campy. But for The Decemberists, it
works. The way the album structurally
mimics a real opera makes the bizarre
subject matter much easier to stomach.
Three different vocalists play the three
lead characters. The chaste-voiced
Becky Stark (from the band Lavender
Diamond) is the distressed Margaret,
takingup lead vocals wheneverthe story
calls for it. My Brightest Diamond's
Shara Worden voices the evil queen
with Disney-esque prowess. Meloy,
meanwhile, is convincing as both the
noble hero and the conniving evildoer
in "The Rake's Song." Each track segues
into the next, demanding the album be
listened to from start to finish.
Even Wagner would be proud - leit-
motifs are used masterfully throughout
Hazards (for example, whenever the
treacherous queen is about to sing, a
brooding, distorted guitar line comes in).
Sometimes with concept albums,

excessive narrative and structural con-
cerns take top priority and the music
suffers. Not here. Meloy has an almost
preternatural gift for melody, routinely-
turning clunky; word-heavy phrases
into dulcet melodic lines. "A Bower
Scene" and "The Queen's Rebuke/The
Crossing" see The Decemberists blast-
ing off into new, distortion-and-solo
territory. These harder-rock songs not
only set the mood for the album's more
narratively menacing moments, but
also unveil a refreshing sound for The
Decemberists; more than any other time
in its career, the band actually sounds
like it's rocking out and having fun.
This album was a definite risk. The
Decemberists seemingly ignored com-
mercial and credibility issues and made
the ambitious, thoroughly odd record
they wanted to make. And it paid off.
Like all good rock-operas or concept
records before it, Hazards is more than
an album - it's a.theatrical, fully engag-
ing experience.

declined to speculate about whether
the new AnnArbor.com will pro-
vide people with a replacement they
could be satisfied with. Though he
did say that Ann Arbor was "more
likely to embrace an online publica-
tion than other communities."
He said that people typically
cite interactivity, spontaneity and
publishing "as it happens" as the
advantages of online news sources.
"That is by no means our
strength," he said.
For Askins, the freedom to write
as much as necessary and include
as much detail and thoroughness
as possible sets online publishing
apart from print, where there are
limits on paper space.
"It's the vertical scroll bar we
take advantage of," he said.
Whether AnnArbor.com will
share this philosophy is unknown.
"The importantthing is thatyou
have a news organization that has
sustainable economics to it so that
it exists," Askins said.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said that although he was confi-
dent local news coverage would
continue without The Ann Arbor
News, he said "it does mean the
loss of another way to get info out
to the public."

of the News, learned of the closing

during most of his time at the

buyout package first offered by the
News last fall in an effort to down-
size staff and cut costs.
Though Pitts has plans to begin
law school in the coming months,
he said that most people were
unprepared for the prospect of
unemployment.
"What was dropped this morn-
ing was a lot different than what
people had expected," Pitts said in
an interview yesterday.
"It's uncharted territory,"
Hieftje said of the loss. "But there's

Indeed, many worry that for
newspapers with extensivecoverage
of local news, moving to the Internet
will have negative consequences.
Primarily, there is concern that
newspapers will lose the credibility
that sustains their traditional posi-
tion as a necessary check on institu-
tions - a protector of democracy.
Traditional newspapers, like The
Ann Arbor News, have been forced
to compete with an explosion of
online content, and as a result
they're suffering from declining
subscriptions and advertising rev-
enue. These factors is the crushing
economic crisis making consumers
think twice about buying some-
thing they can get online for free.

the first paper to go through this
transition. The Seattle Post-Intel-
ligencer published its final print
edition last Tuesday, and it's now
available only online.

Pochoda also said the reorgani-

"Projects will not be subject to

Pochoda said that being profit-

rather that it meet or exceed the

"To be fair, the new budget

said.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Berenson impressed with Vaughan's stint at wing*

By GJON JUNCAJ
Daily Sports Writer
When Michigan hockey sopho-
more Ben Winnett injured his knee
Mar. 13 against Western Michigan,
the Wolverines lost an experienced
center on their fourth line and a key
penalty killer.
Winnett's injury didn't heal as
fast as the coach-
ing staff had NOTEBOOK
hoped, and Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson was forced
to move freshman Luke Glendening
to center in practice last week to
handle faceoff duties.
So, needing to fill a hole at right
wing, Berenson let his curiosity get
the best of him.
SophomoreScooterVaughan,who
had played defense his entire colle-
giate career, was surprised when he
discovered he would switch to the
open forward spot. The Placentia,
Calif., native played on the fourth
line in the CCHA Tournament last
weekend alongside Glendening and
senior Brandon Naurato.
With Alaska playing just three
lines for most of Friday's semifinal
game, Vaughan didn't see as much
ice time as Berenson would have
liked. But Berenson said Vaughan
looked decent in his limited oppor-
tunities.
"The thing I like about him is he's
an upbeat skater," Berenson said
Friday. "He's a better-than-average
skater and gives us some jump. He
also gives us some good puck touch-
es. He has pretty good hands and
he's hungry to play."

percent of their draws this season.
" Berenson admitted he was con-

I

cerned about the night-and-day
performance butsaid losing faceoffs
can depend more on individual
matchups than discouraging trends
within the team.
The player most responsible for
the discrepancy in the circles was
Notre Dame junior center Kevin
Deeth, who won 14 of 21 draws.
Deeth was surprisingly dominant
against sophomore forward Louie
Caporusso, taking seven of eight
draws from the Wolverines' top
faceoff man. Caporusso entered the
weekend having won 58.2 percent of
his draws. Deeth is just as impres-
sive in the circle, winning 58.4 per-
cent of his faceoffs this season.
HONOR ROLL: Caporusso and
junior defenseman Steve Kampfer
were selected to the CCHA All-
Tournament team after Saturday's
title game.
Caporusso had a goal and five
assists in four games in the tourna-
ment. The Woodbridge, ont., native
is tied for fourth in the nation with
24 goals. He is also one of10 finalists
for the Hobey Baker award, given
to the nation's top college hockey
player.
Kampfer notched two assists and
accumulated a plus-two plus-minus
rating in the conference playoffs.
Notre Dame goaltender Jordan

Pearce was the tournament's most
valuable player. Fighting Irish
defenseman Ian Cole and forwards
Ben Ryan and Calle Ridderwall
rounded out the All-Tournament
squad.
PERFECT ATTENDANCE: Senior
forwards Tim Miller and Travis
Turnbull both played in their 165th
consecutive game Saturday, break-
ing the program record set by Rob
Brown (1986-1990). Neither Miller
nor Turnbull has missed a game
during their collegiate careers.
Their streak dates back to 2005.
Miller, named CCHA's top defen-
sive forward last Thursday, has
scored a goal and three assists in
his past three games. Turnbullwent
pointless on the weekend.
NOTES:Saturday'sdefeatsnapped
Michigan's nine-game winning
streak at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit.
The Wolverines had not lost there
since the Fighting Irish beat them
in the 2007 CCHA Championship
game. ... Saturday marked just the
second time this season Michigan
has lost with a lead after two peri-
ods. The first came on Nov. 14, a 2-1
defeat against Western Michigan....
The fourgoals allowedin Saturday's
third period were the most the Wol-
verines have surrendered in a single
stanza since the opening round of
the 2007 NCAA Tournament, an 8-5
loss to North Dakota.

SAIDALSALAH/Daily
Sophomore Scooter Vaughan had never played forward for Michigan until this weekend's CCHA Tournament semifinals and finals.

With Winnett still questionable
for Michigan's first-round matchup
with Air Force in the NCAA Tour-
nament, Berenson said Vaughan
might stay on the wing. Berenson
thought Glendening looked smooth
at center, and Vaughan said he felt
comfortable on the ice with his new
linemate.
"I think me and Luke cycle
the puck really well down low,"
Vaughan said. "I bring a little speed

and a little physical play. I didn't
really show thatmuch this weekend,
but it's something I need to work on
through practice and I'll getanother
chance this upcoming weekend."
Vaughan said his primary goal
entering the weekend was to have
a positive plus-minus rating. And
although he didn't record a point
against Alaska or Notre Dame, he
registered a plus-two on the week-
end.

TROUBLE IN THE CIRCLE: Michi-
gan looked like two different teams
in the faceoff circles last weekend.
The Wolverines won 42 of 68 draws
(61.8 percent) against Alaska, which
has won 50.3 percent of its faceoffs
this season.
But Michigan was uncharac-
teristically submissive against
Notre Dame, winning just 23-of-62
faceoffs (37.1 percent) against the
Fighting Irish, who have won 56

FOOTBALL UPDATE: TONEY CLEMONS TO TRANSFER
Sophomore wide receiverToney Clemons has left the football team,

Lee, Merritt and Shepherd were the nucleus of Blue's turnaround

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -
As C.J. Lee walked off the
court for the last time in
is career as a member
of the Michigan JASON
men's basketball KOHLER
team, not only
did the Michigan On men's
fans stand up and basketball
acknowledge the fifth-year senior
guard, but so did his teammates
and coaches.

If there was anyone who had a
right to hold a grudge against Lee,
it was Kelvin Grady, who Lee edged
out of the starting lineup. But the
sophomore guard embraced Lee in
a long hugbefore the captain took
a seat.
In the waning minutes of a loss
to Oklahoma Saturday, Lee had just
fouled out for the first time in his
career. Occupyingthe bottom posi-
tion in the 1-3-1 zone, he stood face

to face with the hest player in the
country, the Sooners' Blake Griffin,
and refused to back down.
And as Lee took a seat with
Michigan down by nine points, he
quickly jumped up, yelling com-
mands at his teammates on the
floor. Next to him, Grady followed
suit, yelling out, "Keep fighting!"
He was just following the lead of
his captain - something the Wol-
verines did all season.


Replacing Lee on the court was
fellow fifth-year senior captain
David Merritt. And in the final
minute, senior Jevohn Shepherd
subbed in.
On Selection Sunday last year,
Lee, Merritt and Shepherd sat
down and talked about how they
were goingto lead the Wolverines
back to the NCAA Tournament.
The weight was on their shoul-
ders. They didn't have a choice.
Without the seniors, this team
would have been lost and would
have lacked the guidance to take
the Wolverines back to the Big
Dance.
Coming into this season,
sophomore Manny Harris was an
unquestionably talented scorer,
but he was still young and very
quiet in the locker room. Junior
DeShawn Sims was more experi-
enced but was still adapting to his
new role under the guidance of
Michigan coach John Beilein.
The duo's star power wasn't
enough - the Wolverines needed
leaders.
Thisnseason, Lee averaged just
2.8 points and 1.5 assists and Mer-
ritt just 1.9 points and 1.0 assists.
But their impact on their team-
mates was unmeasurable.
They did the little things. They
talked when the team needed a
voice. They set the pace in practice.
They were the identity of the
team.
Beilein selected Merritt to give
the pregame speeches and gave
Lee the starting point guard posi-
tion - and their teammates were
watching.
Freshman guard Stu Douglass
said his whole motivation in the
NCAA Tournament came from
wanting to win for the seniors.
"You don't want tosee these

Fifth-year senior C.J. Lee was a nocal and emntional leader for the Wolnerines all year.

guys go," Douglass said. "That was
all the motivation in the world."
When Lee wentto the bench,
he knew it was the end, but he also
knew his team wouldn't go down
without a fight.
And in the waning minutes of the
game, the Wolverines put together
one of their scrappiest performanc-
es of the year. In the last possession
of the game, Michigan grabbed four
offensive reboundsbefore Sims
threw in a layup.
After the game, Lee said he
would like to be remembered as
a player that came every day and
fought hard, representing Michigan
to the fullest. Every time he put

on that jersey, people knew he was
going to bring it.
Lee then mused, "That's defi-
nitely what they can say about us
(as a team)."
Lee, Merritt and Shepherd won't
be back next year. But they won't
be forgotten. They can't be forgot-
ten because they are the epitome of
Michigan basketball.
A few years ago, Michigan bas-
ketball had a different image.
It was an image of the NIT. It
was the image of failingto win
down the stretch. It was the image
of teams with weak leadership.
These seniors changed that.
They didn't have a choice.
