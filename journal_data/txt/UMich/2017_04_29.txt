APRIL 22: The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the state of Michigan’s 
ban on affirmative action, specifically the consideration of race in public 

universities’ admissions. In the majority opinion, Justice Anthony 

Kennedy held that under the Constitution, the voter-enacted ban in 

Michigan could not be overturned at the national level. 

SEPTEMBER 5: Mark Schlissel bacame the 14th president of 

the University, succeeding Mary Sue Coleman. Schlissel, who was 

previously the provost at Brown University, discussed his vision for an 

inclusive and accessible campus in his inaugral address. He encouraged 
the exchange of diverse viewpoints and experiences to attain “true 
excellence.” Schlissel’s term began July 1.

Black Student Union 
issues seven demands 
aimed at increasing 
campus diversity

University 
students 
took 

to Twitter in droves Tuesday 
afternoon to share their experiences 
as Black students in Ann Arbor and 
bring attention to issues of race 
and diversity on campus using the 
hashtag #BBUM.

“Being Black at the University 

of Michigan has many shades and 
many levels to what someone might 
want to speak on it. It can go from 
someone being the only Black 
person in their class to someone 
with no problems at all.”

-LSA senior Eric Gavin
The campaign, initiated by the 

University’s Black Student Union, 
has built up over the past few 
days before trending nationally 
on Twitter Tuesday. The hashtag 
gained 
momentum 
after 
the 

student organization distributed an 
e-mail to community members and 
other campus groups encouraging 
them to participate in the online 
conversation.

LSA 
senior 
Tyrell 
Collier, 

BSU’s president, said the #BBUM 
campaign was planned to raise 
awareness of the experiences of 
Black students and for the BSU to 
collect subjective data it can couple 
with University statistics to address 
pressing issues Black students face.

Collier said BSU encouraged 

students to tweet both negative and 
positive experiences, though the 
tweets have been predominantly 
negative, which he expected.

He said the issue is especially 

pressing on campus because while 
the University frequently discusses 
ways to increase diversity, many 
communities have yet to witness 
tangible results.

“I would like to see the lives of 

Black students valued more,” Collier 
said.

By 10 p.m., over 10,000 tweets 

included the hashtag from Ann 
Arbor and beyond.

“I don’t think this is a problem 

specific to the University, I think it’s 
an experience that Black students at 
predominantly White universities 

across the nation are facing,” he said 
of the far-reaching responses.

Black 
enrollment 
at 
the 

University has fallen precipitously 
over the past decade largely due 
to Proposal 2, an amendment to 
the state constitution that bans 
affirmative action policies that 
was passed by Michigan voters 
in 2006. The proposal, formally 
named the Michigan Civil Rights 
Initiative, bars the University from 
considering race in its admissions 
process.

Immediately after the passage of 

the proposal, University President 
Mary Sue Coleman gave a dramatic 
address on the Diag promising 
to 
maintain 
the 
University’s 

commitment to diversity. However, 
the institution has been unable 
to stanch the decline in minority 
enrollment 
through 
alternative 

outreach policies in the wake of the 
affirmative action ban.

In Fall 2006, Black students made 

up around seven percent of the 
undergraduate population. In Fall 
2013, the University reported that 
Black undergraduate enrollment 
had fallen to 4.65 percent. Hispanic 
enrollment as a percentage of the 
overall undergraduate body also 
declined over the same period.

At a search forum for the next 

University president in September, 
the Presidential Search Advisory 
Committee — which includes the 
University’s Board of Regents — 
heard from a number of students 
about diversity issues. Several 
student speakers at the event said 
many minorities feel they lack a 
voice on campus and occasionally 
experience bias incidents with both 
students and instructors.

Collier 
said 
the 
University 

has not yet contacted BSU about 
Tuesday’s campaign. University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald stressed 
that the University’s next step will 
be to listen to the students and their 
experiences on campus.

“I think at this point the listening 

is the most important part and how 
we might respond is the next step 
and we haven’t gotten there yet,” 
Fitzgerald said.

He said the University is aware of 

students’ concerns and recognizes 
that there is always room for 
improvement in any organization.

However, the University’s social 

media team responded to the 
campaign via Twitter Tuesday 
afternoon: “Thanks for engaging in 
this conversation. We’re listening, 
and will be sure all of your voices 

are heard. #BBUM”

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
the 

University’s 
vice 
president 
for 

student life, created a Twitter 
account late Tuesday to address the 
issue.

“Got on Twitter to hear and 

support your voices. Proud of our 
students. 
More 
later,” 
Harper 

wrote.

LSA senior Eric Gavin, BSU’s 

public relations chair, said several 
recent campus events spurred the 
organization to plan a campaign, 
including a recent controversy 
involving 
Theta 
Xi 
fraternity 

members who branded a party with 
racialized images and words.

BSU also timed its Twitter 

campaign to correspond with a 
forum this evening hosted by the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, the Black Student 
Union, We are Michigan and 
Students of Color of Rackham.

BSU hopes to not only engage 

members of its organization but also 
Black campus leaders from an array 
of groups, Gavin said. However, 
leaders didn’t believe the student 
organization would receive national 
attention for its efforts.

“I definitely could not have 

foreseen the national attention 
we have garnered in such a short 
amount of time,” Gavin said. “We 
felt it necessary to push for an 
initiative that would bring more 
awareness to these issues and to the 
larger Black community.”

Though 
traditional 
methods 

such as campus demonstrations 
play a role in raising awareness, 
Gavin said BSU decided social 
media could serve as an additional 
method for sparking dialogue.

“It kept it open ended and that’s 

why it so successful,” Gavin said. 
“The hashtag leaves for open ended 
interpretation so people can say 
what they feel instead of imposing 
somebody’s thoughts on them.”

So far, students have voiced an 

array of perspectives.

“Being Black at the University 

of Michigan has many shades and 
many levels to what someone might 
want to speak on it,” Gavin said. 
“It can go from someone being the 
only Black person in their class to 
someone with no problems at all. 
It’s a spectrum, but we want people 
to be aware of everyone’s different 
ideas on the issue of being Black at 
the University of Michigan.”

As news that the Supreme 

Court ruled in favor of same-sex 
marriage swept across the U.S. 
Friday morning, supporters rallied 
in both downtown Ann Arbor and 
Washington D.C. in celebration of 
this historic decision. 

The Jim Toy Community Center, 

an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, transgender and queer 
residents of Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti 
and the greater Washtenaw County 
area, hosted a “Day of Decision 
Rally” so supporters could gather 
in response to the Court’s decision. 

After quieting the crowd, April 

DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, one 
couple represented in the string 
of cases considered by the Court, 
offered remarks under rainbow 
colored streamers during the press 
conference portion of the event. 
DeBoer thanked her lawyers for 
their determination and hard 
work.

In January 2012, Michigan 

residents April DeBoer and Jayne 
Rowse filed a lawsuit in the 
U.S. District Court, challenging 
Michigan’s ban on adoption by 
same-sex couples.

DeBoer and Rowse separately 

adopted 
one 
son 
and 
two 

daughters, respectively, but were 
unable to jointly adopt their 
children because Michigan law did 
not recognize same-sex marriages, 
and only granted joint parent 
adoption rights to married couples.

“It’s been a long, long, hard 

road,” Deboer said. “It’s been four 
and a half years in the making… We 
would not be here if it weren’t for 
many people, and first and foremost 
our attorneys: Dana Nessel and 
Ken Mogill, Bob Sedler and Carole 
Stanyar. So I want to thank you 
guys as well. My last comment is to 
my beautiful children: We did this 
for you,” DeBoer said.

Carole Stanyar, one of the 

attorneys for DeBoer and Rowse, 
also spoke at the press conference, 
praising her team and clients for 
their hard work and resilience. 
She 
expressed 
pride 
in 
the 

accomplishments of her case.

“This 
was 
a 
definitive 

statement under equal protection, 
fundamental right, liberty, due 
process,” Stanyar said. “It was for 
now, and it’s for future generations. 
The bans are unconstitutional. 
States cannot treat people this 
way. They cannot treat people 
unequally. Same-sex couples, their 
families, their children, have to be 
treated with dignity and respect,” 

Stanyar said. 

In an interview with the press, 

Attorney General Bill Schuette 
said 
throughout 
litigations, 

his main argument challenged 
who would decide if same-sex 
marriage should be recognized 
in different states. 

“We argued this case is a 

question of who decides: the 
voters across the United States 
of America, or the Justices of the 
Supreme Court,” he said. “It was 
about voters and who decides, that 
was what the case was about.”

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor 
also 
offered 
remarks 

during 
the 
celebration. 
In 

an interview with the Daily, 
Taylor was enthusiastic about 
this progressive milestone in 
Michigan’s history.

“I could not be more excited for 

the people of Ann Arbor and for 
all Americans. This is a day when 
the Supreme Court has redeemed 
the American promise of equality 
before the law. It has ratified 
that gay, lesbian, transgender 
and bisexual people are fully 
and finally embraced into the 
American family. It’s just — it’s 
wonderful,” Taylor said. 

Beth 
Sherman, 
assistant 

professor of social work at the 
University and her wife, Karen 
Hawver, owner of Precision 
Accounting 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 

attended the celebration and 
press conference at Braun Court 
with their two children. 

Sherman and Hawver were 

one of the 300 couples married 
in Michigan in March 2014 after 
a U.S. federal judge struck down 
s the state’s ban on same-sex 
marriage. Both were excited that 
the Supreme Court’s decision 
would further legitimize their 
marriage. 

“We’ve been together for 21 

years and we have two kids, and 
now it just means eventually 
we’ll be able to both be their legal 
parents. We were able to marry 
the one day in Michigan, but now 
it just means our marriage will 
be recognized, so it’s good for us 
and for our children.”

University 
alum 
Alanna 

Maguire, a project manager of the 
National Marriage Challenge, 
a 
non-profit 
committed 
to 

legalizing same-sex marriage in 
the U.S., said she was proud of 
her team. She also said she was 
proud of her fiancé Dana Nessel, 
also a University alum and an 
attorney for the April DeBoer 
and Jayne Rowse case. She said 
she was also excited that she 
and Nessel could now obtain a 

marriage license themselves. 

“I can get married in my 

home state. Dana Nessel and I 
are both from Michigan. We’re 
both University of Michigan 
graduates. We love our state. We 
just wanted to make it better, 
and I’m so, so proud of Dana 
particularly today. She carried 
this case from start to finish,” 
said Maguire. 

Brad 
O’Connor, 
president 

of the Jim Toy Community 
Center, expressed enthusiasm 
for his own marriage, which 
was officiated in Illinois, to be 
officially recognized in his home 
state of Michigan. 

“It means that...my family, 

that was only recognized in two-
thirds of the country, is now 
recognized nationwide. I can go 
to Texas or I can go to Louisiana 
and Maine and California and 
have my marriage valid there,” 
said O’Connor.

However, although O’Connor 

reserved today for celebration, he 
added that the Supreme Court’s 
decision resolves only one aspect 
of the LGBTQ community’s 
current struggle for equality in 
the U.S.

“This is just something that 

we check off the list. There’s 
so much more left to do with 
regards to bullying in high 
schools, transgender rights — 
that’s huge— making sure that 
we’re protected at work, because 
we could be fired, still, for being 
gay. The fight’s not over. It’s just 
the battle’s won. It’s a big battle, 
but this battle’s won, and now 
it’s time to move on and keep 
fighting,” O’Connor said.

Aside from granting same-sex 

couples the right to marriage, the 
Supreme Court’s decision could 
have further legal stipulations 
on health and work benefits. 

University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
will review the Court’s ruling 
and adjust benefits for same-sex 
couples in both a legal and timely 
fashion. 

“We 
realize 
that 
some 

members of our community 
will be anxious to change their 
benefit enrollment status and we 
will study the ruling carefully 
to ensure that we offer new 
eligibility in a manner that is 
legal and timely,” Fitzgerald 
said. 

In an interview with the Daily, 

University law professor Julian 
Mortenson said the Court’s 
decision could have an impact 
on health benefits the University 
offers. 

“For 
every 
category 
as 

to 
which 
marriage 
triggers 

rights and responsibilities, like 
benefits, 
access, 
permissions 

to health care facilities, etc., 
same-sex marriage couples will 
have exactly the same rights as 
opposite-sex couples,” he said. 

The Supreme Court’s ruling 

was thorough enough to address 
any other potential issues, he 
added, saying it was clear in its 
decision. 

“There 
were 
more 

complicated scenarios that could 
possibly have emerged from this 
opinion before it was released, 
but as it turns out, the Supreme 
Court has written a decision that 
is very straightforward and is 
very emphatic,” he said. 

Sen. 
Gary 
Peters 
(Mich.) 

lauded April DeBoer and Jayne 
Rowse in a statement for their 
courage in taking their case to 
the Supreme Court. 

“With 
this 
decision, 

thousands of Michigan same-sex 
couples will finally be afforded 
the same opportunity to marry 
as other Americans, including 
April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse 
of Michigan, who courageously 
took their case all the way to the 
United States Supreme Court,” 
Peters said.

#BBUM twitter campaign 
garners national attention 
to the University 

SEPTEMBER 2: The University of Michigan adopted a new sexual 
misconduct policy that emphasized investigation over testimonials 
of complaints. Its implementation followed a 2011 mandate from 

the Department of Education, which clarified Title IX such that 

University investigations into sexual misconduct became obligatory. 

The Office of Student Conflict Resolution, the Office of Institutional 

Equity and the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center 
worked together to amend the policy. 

NOVEMBER 19: In a Twitter campaign that prompted over 

10,000 tweets, the Black Student Union gained national distinction. 

Central to the conversation were issues of race and diversity on campus. 
Students incorporated the hashtag #BBUM, which stands for “Being 
Black at the University of Michigan” to bring awareness to the lives and 
experiences of Black students.

Monday. The speakers made demands concerning their campaign, Being Black at University of Michigan, giving University 
officials seven days to respond.

Daily Staff Reporter 2016

University of Michigan president 

Mark Schlissel responded to several 
political and religious statements 
chalked on the Diag this week, 
including “Stop Islam,” “Trump 
2016” 
and 
“Build 
the 
Wall,” 

Thursday afternoon, stressing a 
campus committment statement to 
creating a welcoming and inclusive 
environment for all groups on 
campus

“Attacks directed toward any 

individual or group within our 
community, based on a belief or 
characteristic, are inconsistent with 
the university’s values of respect, 
civility and equality, “ Schlissel 
said. “These are core values and 
guiding principles that will help us 
as we strive to live up to our highest 
ideals.”

He emphasized the need for 

the University community to form 
a unified front and strive toward 
understanding and respect for all 
individuals.

The statements, which were 

largely washed off by Thursday, 
prompted 
students 
to 
call 

University police Wednesday and 
group together to wash some of the 
chalkings off that same evening. 
Though the phrases were written 
in chalk, students gathered on the 
Diag Wednesday said they thought 
the effects of them were more 
permanent on campus climate.

Rackham 
student 
Banen 

Al-Sheemary said she and fellow 
students who encountered the 
writing and gathered in the Diag 
found the sayings hurtful and 
disturbing. 

“This is so reflective of our 

student campus and the depths of 
racism and the things that students 
of color have to endure and that 
the administration is continuously 
silent on,” Al-Sheemary said. “This 
is just another example. This is 
happening year after year and we’ve 
been telling the administration the 

same things over and over again.”

Al-Sheemary said she and other 

students had been attempting to 
contact the University’s Division of 
Public Safety and Security as well 
as the University’s administration 
regarding 
the 
writing 
since 

Wednesday morning without much 
response.

“I’ve 
been 
getting 
bounced 

around from one person to another, 
and I understand it’s after hours, 
but there should be some kind of 
emergency number besides the 
police because a lot of students of 
color don’t feel comfortable calling 
the police,” Al-Sheemary said. 
“They’re our only resource and that 
I think is ridiculous.”

One DPSS officer arrived at the 

scene around 6:45 p.m Wednesday, 
but informed students that there 
was not much that could be done 
because it was after hours. In 
response, a group of about ten 
students began to wash the chalk 
messages off the Diag with water 
and towels themselves, pouring 
buckets of water to erase the 
statements and wiping down other 
concrete with rags.

“It’s 
irresponsible 
of 
the 

administration that we are actually 
out here with buckets of water and 
napkins to clean off these hateful 
messages and the administration 
isn’t taking care of it,” Al-Sheemary 
said. 
“And 
not 
only 
is 
the 

administration not taking care of it, 
they are putting us through a really 
difficult process. That perpetuates 
these really racist and hateful 
stereotypes that turn into violence 
and turn into students of color 
feeling unsafe on campus.”

LSA junior Tahany Alsabahi, 

one of the students who contacted 
DPSS, 
echoed 
Al-Sheemary’s 

sentiments.

“There needs to be another 

resource for students, and I think, 
also, the University has to speak 
out against these things,” Alsabahi 
said. “Because oftentimes when this 
happens for other groups, they’re 
very quick to release statements and 

say that they don’t condone anti-
Semitism or any other type of stuff 
like that, but it gets really iffy and it 
becomes really difficult to get them 
to speak out against Islamophobia.”

In 
a 
statement 
Wednesday 

night in response to the incident, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University was 
committed to inclusivity.

“Earlier today someone used 

chalk to write a #stopislam message 
on the main square in the heart of 
our campus known as the Diag,” the 
statement read. “Attacks directed 
toward any member or group 
within the University of Michigan 
community, based on a belief or 
characteristic, 
are 
inconsistent 

with our values of respect, civility 
and equality. We all understand 
that where speech is free it will 
sometimes wound. But our message 
is this: We are fully committed 
to fostering an environment that 
is welcoming and inclusive of 
everyone. Tonight we are reminded 
there is much work yet to be done.”

Fitzgerald also noted that several 

reports had been filed with the 
University’s bias response team, 
and officials from the team had 
been to the Diag Wednesday.

Al-Sheemary said she was not 

surprised by either the various 
writings for and against Republican 
presidential 
candidate 
Donald 

Trump, or statements targeting 
Muslim students.

“It’s 
nothing 
new,” 

Al-Sheemary said. “Maybe it 
has just been heightened with 
the election, but this is just 
something that happened before 
9/11, spiked with 9/11 and it’s not 
anything new and it affects a lot 
of students of color.”

Alsabahi also noted that she 

thought statements like those 
on the Diag had connotations 
beyond political.

“When 
speech 
can 
incite 

violence and aggression and 
hatred towards another group, 
that’s when it becomes hate 
speech,” she said.

Both a vigil and anti-Trump 

rally were held Wednesday night in 
protest of President-elect Donald 
Trump’s unexpected win in the 
Diag, drawing a crowd of nearly 
1,000 University of Michigan 
students, faculty and staff, as well 
as community members.

The 
vigil 
featured 
both 

student speakers and University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel. 
Speakers 
called 
for 

perseverance during the next four 
years of Trump’s term, discussing 
both the fear felt by minority 
students on campus and the 
importance of action.

LSA senior Nicole Khamis 

opened the vigil by recounting 
conversations with her parents, 
who are Palestinian refugees, the 
morning after Election Day.

“We came here for a better life 

and last night, I woke up at 2:30 
to the election results,” she said. 
“I thought it was a dream. And 
I called my parents, they could 
see that my eyes are red because 
I had been tearing up. … And (my 
mother) looked at me and said, 
‘This is not the end.’ ”

Throughout 
his 
campaign, 

Trump has criticized President 
Barack Obama and Democratic 
presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton’s policy of allowing more 
Syrian refugees to enter the 
country. 
Trump’s 
immigration 

plan details an end to letting a 
number of groups into the United 
States, and in February Trump 
claimed he would look at Syrian 
children and tell them they could 
not enter the country.

“Are we going to stand up in 

the face of racism, in the face of 
sexism, in the face of xenophobia?” 
Khamis asked the cheering crowd. 
“My parents have escaped a war 
to have a better life for me and my 
two siblings. And we did not come 
to this country for this.”

In 
his 
remarks, 
Schlissel 

congratulated University students 
for waiting in lines and voting, 
stating that student voices were 
90-10 in favor of a candidate other 
than Trump. Earlier today, he 
penned an email to students urging 
them to be inclusive and work 
toward intellectual honesty in 
their conversations.

“Ninety 
percent 
of 
you 

rejected the kind of hate and the 
fractiousness and the longing for 
some kind of idealized version of 
a non-existent yesterday that was 
expressed during the campaign,” 
Schlissel said during the event. “So 
I urge you, continue your advocacy 
and your voices are already being 
heard. They are loud and clear — 
this is the way America changes. 
It’s the way it always changes. 
It’s the way it will change for the 
better.”

According 
to 
USA 
Today 

exit polls, 56 percent of voters 
nationwide ages 18 to 24 voted for 
Clinton. There are no age-based 
exit polls specifically for Ann 
Arbor, but Michigan Daily surveys 
of students in the leadup to the 
election indicated a strong campus 
preference for Clinton at about 70 
percent.

At the rally, similar sentiments 

were expressed. Business junior 
Myles Hawkins said he felt shock 
after finding out the results of the 
election, and that he came to the 
rally to gain a sense of comfort 
about the situation.

“(As an) African American, it’s 

hard to fathom Donald Trump 
being my president because he 
(has) no respect for my background, 
and it’s shocking to have gone from 
the first Black president, which 
was celebrated in my family … to 

a person who doesn’t seem to care 
about (them) or my culture,” he 
said.

The rally emphasized solidarity 

and began with a chant: “The 
people united will never be 
divided,” that progressively grew 
into a unified roar.

Speakers at both the vigil and 

the rally also emphasized the need 
to take action moving forward. In 
remarks at the vigil, CSG President 
David Schafer, an LSA senior, 
asked all individuals in the crowd 
to hold others accountable for 
discriminatory actions. He said 
minority students have had to be 
the ones responsible for calling 
out hate speech in the past, citing 
an incident last semester when 
Muslim students were the ones to 
wash off anti-Islamophobic chalk 
drawings on the Diag.

“To all that have been targeted 

or marginalized: You have a place 
on this campus,” he said. “The 
University of Michigan is yours 
just as much as anybody else’s. 
Don’t stop challenging each other. 
So I am challenging everyone 
here tonight who professes to be 
an ally — whenever you hear a 
microaggression, whenever you 
hear an act of discrimination and 
bigotry or injustice perpetrated by 
one of your friends or anyone of 
your acquaintances, step up and 
challenge them. Because if you 
don’t, you are part of the problem.”

LSA senior Tina Al-khersan 

told the crowd at the vigil several 
stories about her younger brother 
being asked if he had bombs 
underneath his coat in a response 
to Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric, 
which has included statements 
about deporting Muslims due to 
their possibly being terrorists. 

Speaking before Al-khersan, 

University alum Harleen Kaur said 
she felt afraid for her life the day 
after Trump’s win.

“I simply ask for you to not 

be comfortable as we have after 
violence and tragedy countless 
times before,” Kaur said. “Do not 
let yourself be destroyed by fear but 
do not let yourself be wooed into 
calm. There’s work to be done.”

Multiple speakers at both the 

vigil and rally told the crowd they 
had the right to feel sadness about 
the election result, calling it a 
confirmation that the country does 
not support minorities.

At the vigil, Khamis said her 

family has not traveled to the 
United States only to be deported.

“We need to organize, we need 

to mobilize,” she said. “Remember 
this is not a new fight for my 
family, this is not a new fight for 
women, this is not a new fight for 
Latina/Latino, this is not a new 
fight for the LGBT+ community. 
This has been happening forever. 
But now we know that it has been 
institutionalized to the point it is in 
the White House.”

Earlier in the night at the rally, 

Public Policy graduate student 
Sundar Sharma expressed similar 
sentiments.

“(We must) grieve and rebuild 

… especially because of the forces 
trying to stop us,” Sharma said. 
“Trump and Trumpism isn’t going 
to be around forever.”

LSA 
senior 
Adedolapo 

Adeniji, whose parents are both 
immigrants to the United States, 
told the vigil crowd she was not 
going to stop fighting — and asked 
fellow students to do the same.

“I don’t care what the election 

said today,” she said. “I don’t 
care what it says in the next four 
years. I refuse to stop fighting 
not because of my family of 
immigrants who have nobody 
to fight for them, not just for me 
for the people for look like me, 
for the people who don’t look 
like me, for the people who have 
visible differences.”

LSA junior Darian Razdar 

asked for help from white 
students in particular to become 
allies. 

“White, straight, cisgendered 

students, it’s the time for you to 
show up for your loved ones,” he 
said. “Don’t fall to the silence of a 
racist and homophobic society,” 
he said. “Be there for those of us 
who need it.”

Ford senior Thomas Hislop, 

a vigil attendee, said while he 
grew up in a Republican house, 
his family does not agree at all 
with Trump’s ideology.

“I grew up in a house of love,” 

he said. “I grew up in a house 
where it was more important to 
care about marginalized people 
than about your marginal taxes.”

Many students said they felt 

energized by the vigil and the 
rally, as well as unity with those 
were also scared about the future 
of the country. School of Music 
Theatre & Dance freshman Nina 
Renella said the vigil allowed her 
to have a more positive space to 
express how she felt.

“I really just wanted to be 

surrounded by love… I feel 
like I have been very sad and 
despaired all day,” she said. 
“And as a person of color, I feel 
very threatened and shaken to 
the core. I am an immigrant, so 
I just wanted to be surrounded 
by love.”

Echoing 
Renenlla, 
LSA 

junior 
Michael 
Miller 
said 

students 
needed 
to 
become 

more organized and continue to 
support each other.

“While today was a very 

emotional day, we need to come 
together like we did tonight,” he 
said. “We need to come together 
for the future. Despite the 
election, despite all of the hatred, 
we need to make that happen.”

Many students also expressed 

the fear and frustration they felt 
for friends and family who could 
be affected by the election’s 
outcome, as well as with how 
the electoral process works, 
throughout the vigil.

LSA junior Dale Mallete said 

while he feared what it would 
create, he had to accept the 
process that led to Trump’s win. 

“The fact that I know LGBT 

friends and family and all of 
the people that I know that 
could be affected by this — it 
leaves a terrible feeling in my 
gut that sort of been there all 
day,” Mallete said. “So I am kind 
of disappointed that this is the 
route that America decided to 
go with. But ultimately I need to 
respect the democratic process 
and have to accept the results of 
the election.

For some students, however, 

the events left something to 
desire. 

LSA junior Remi Murrey 

said she was upset with the 
lack of mentions of Black lives, 
emphasizing that she feels Black 
lives have been consistently 
excluded in both national and 
campuswide dialogues.

“Our lives matter just as much 

as Muslim lives, Latina/Latinx 
lives, and LGBT lives,” she said. 
“We are constantly fighting our 
lives and our lives are being 
taken from us for however long. 
We have to see Donald Trump 
as the President of the United 
States and that is messed up. I 
understand that he had made 
threats 
against 
everyone’s 

community but we are just as 
affected as everyone else in this 
country that we live in.”

“Again, I don’t matter. Not in 

this campus, not in this country, 
not in this world…(God) has 
pushed my ancestors for many 
years and he is going to push me 
for the next four to eight years.”

Norris, the creator of the Race 
Card Project — a nationwide 
initiative that gathers perspectives 
on race and aims to foster dialogue 
on 
the 
subject 
— 
partnered 

with the University during last 
winter’s theme semester on race, 
and will give the 2013 Winter 
Commencement address.

In a form similar to BSU’s 

campaign, Norris used Twitter 
to broaden the reach of the Race 
Card Project because she said even 
though the social media platform 
only allots users only 140 characters, 
it’s a powerful way to stimulate 

uncomfortable conversations.

“I used to say the most productive 

conversations are the private ones, 
but Twitter made me rethink that,” 
Norris said.

Norris noted that the University 

did not “take cover” once the dialogue 
took off, but rather embraced the 
campaign and encouraged students 
to take part in the conversation, 
which is not always the norm for 
large institutions.

“This is an honest conversation,” 

she said. “They wanted to see an 
honest conversation and that’s what 
this is, as uncomfortable as this may 
be for people to read about this.”

She said diversity has been an 

issue on every college campus she 
has visited, and after reading the 
tweets from Tuesday’s discussion at 

Michigan, it is likely the topic isn’t 
going to subside once the Twitter 
debate dies down.

“It 
really 
was 
not 
just 

people talking about their own 
experiences, but it turned into an 
actual dialogue,” she said. “People 
were talking to each other and 
perhaps even learning from each 
other, and more importantly 
listening to each other.”

Norris added that she will 

likely address the issue in her 
commencement 
address 
next 

month.

By asking students to share 

their 
experiences 
as 
Black 

students on campus, BSU is 
hoping to not only bring light to 
challenges, but also to call other 
student leaders to action.

University President Schlissel 
responds to anti-Islam Diag chalk

Almost 1,000 protest president-

elect Trump’s victory in 

rally, vigil on Diag

MARCH 31: Central Student Government rejected a resolution 
to support a committee that would investigate the University’s 
investment in companies that allegedly violate the rights of 
Palestinian people. After four hours of discussion, 15 members of 
the assembly voted in favor, 25 opposed and one abstained. Dozens of 
University affiliates spoke regarding the issue at the deciding meeting. 

SEPTEMBER 10: At a meeting of all members of University 
Greek life, University President Mark Schlissel discussed alcohol 
abuse and sexual assault issues in the Greek community. Schlissel 
said such a party culture hurts the University’s reputation. The 
meeting came in the aftermath of the now infamous ski trips, in 
which several members of the Sigma Alpha Mu faternity vanalized 
a ski resort, as well as nationwide scrutiny Greek life’s party culture. 

FEBUARY 9: Two years after the outbreak of the Flint Water 
Crisis, nearly 100 protesters marched to the Diag, calling out Gov. 
Rick Snyder for acting carelessly. The crisis occurred as a result of 

lead contamination in the city’s water supply, following a switch 

in such supply. The situation was not rectified for almost 18 

months, causing severe health problems. 

NOVEMBER 9: Nearly 1,000 University affiliates took to the 

diag the night after the election of President Donald Trump to 

protest the controversial candidate’s beliefs and policies. Schlissel 

spoke, as did students, who called for perseverence in light of the 
coming four years. Central to the speeches was fear — and a call for 
unity — on behalf of minority groups. 

MARCH 27: University seniors were disappointed when it was 
announced there would be no featured speaker at their commencement 
in late April. Instead, the commencement was to feature a multimedia 

project of University faculty reading the words from past 

commencement speeches. One belief was that the University focused 

more on the bicentennial festivities than on the graduating class. 

APRIL 3: In conjunction with the Bicentennial, seven pop-art 

installations were set up on campus to draw attention to the 

University’s history. Such installations included a ticker tape sign 

above the enterance to the Michigan Union, which displayed rules that 

women had to abide by in terms of building accessibility, as well as 950 
maize and blue chairs on the Diag to recognize the underrepresented 
minority students who did not attend the University after affirmative 
action was banned by Proposal 2. 


4 — Saturday, April 29, 2017
Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Earlier this semester, We Are 

Michigan organized a “Freeze 
Out” 
protest, 
where 
minority 

students and allies banded together 
to form a circle surrounding the 
Diag, carrying signs that read “We 
want real diversity,” and “I am 
that one Black girl in your class” 
along with other signs outlining 
the low minority representation 
on campus. Following an offensive 
“Hood Ratchet Thursday” party 
planned by the University’s chapter 
of Theta Xi, student leaders have 
responded by organizing forums 
to raise awareness and urging 
campus leadership to hold students 
accountable 
for 
irresponsible 

behavior and, more importantly, to 
stop treating these aggressions as 
isolated instances. 

As part of their general LSA 

requirements, every student must 
take at least three credits from a 
list of approved courses that fulfill a 
race and ethnicity requirement. To 
be approved, classes must discuss 
the meaning of race, ethnicity and 
racism, inequality resulting from 
racial and ethnic intolerance, and 
comparisons 
of 
discrimination 

based on race, ethnicity, religion, 
social class or gender. The goal 
of this requirement is to prepare 
students for working in multiethnic, 

multiracial environments in school 
and beyond. However, many of these 
classes are history courses that are 
highly theoretical in material. This 
is misleading because they imply 
history alone is more relevant than 
discussing the very tangible lasting 
effects and contemporary legacy 
of that history. Students should be 
required to take specific courses 
that openly discuss issues related to 
racism, classism and sexism as they 
exist and inform their interactions — 
in society generally and particularly 
on this campus. 

Instead, a required course about 

identity will help us nurture a more 
socially aware and responsible 
student body, and will serve as an 
unprecedented 
demonstration 

to 
students 
that 
University 

administration is committed to 
promoting and institutionalizing 
diversity education. This required 
course should replace the current 
race and ethnicity requirement 
and should become a part of every 
incoming 
freshman’s 
schedule. 

The course should discuss social 
identity in its multiple forms — 
spanning issues of racism, sexism, 
LGBTQ discrimination, classism 
and discussing the ways in which 
power and privilege play an 
unignorable role in sustaining 

these 
issues. 
Learning 
and 

reading 
material, 
assignments 

and discussions should challenge 
students to consider their own 
identities and the role they play 
in society. To nurture meaningful 
discussion and a safe space, the 
course should be dialogue-based, 
with facilitators who are trained 
by the University’s Program on 
Intergroup Relations and the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution. 

We recognize that students 

in this course will interact and 
respond to material very differently, 
and some may feel uncomfortable. 
However, if the University is serious 
about creating a climate that is 
safe for all identities, it must urge 
students to confront the serious 
and often uncomfortable questions 
that 
our 
campus 
community 

cannot afford to overlook. Since the 
University has already instituted 
the race and ethnicity requirement, 
it only makes sense that it be 
refined and modernized to fulfill 
the goal for which it was created 
and adjust to the needs of shifting 
campus climate. Only upon having 
these serious conversations, both 
with themselves and with others, 
will students be prepared to enter a 
diverse world without threatening 
the safety of others in that space.

Columnist 2016

There have been many “not mys” 

this week. “Not my campus.” “Not 
my president.” “Not my country.” 
You’re all right — these things are 
not yours. They are ours. We should 
be concerned by how polarized 
things seem, and perhaps by how 
we may be complicit in amplifying 
that polarization. What we share 
and how we share it is increasingly 
contentious. This election and its 
aftermath illustrate as much.

This isn’t a call for unity. Unity is 

overrated. We won’t always agree 
on matters of politics. In fact, it’s 
important not to, because more 
often than not, what makes a policy 
“good” falls to normative judgment. 
Sharing and debating a wide swath of 
opinions is invaluable; such discourse 
broadens our collective worldview 
and creates the framework for 
compromise.

Now more than ever we need to (re)

learn how to coexist, and to approach 
conflict with civility and respect, not 
judgment and violence. That much is 
true regardless of the candidate for 
whom you voted. We are all human 
beings with basic shared desires — 
these include security and wellbeing, 
with applications from physical 
to financial to psychological. Our 
individual pursuit of what we need 
varies infinitely, but at its core we can 
find common ground.

If you didn’t vote for Trump, 

consider why such a vast portion 
of the country did. Know that their 
frustration and anger might have 
paralleled what you feel now if 
Trump had lost. Many Trump voters 
feel they are being mischaracterized 
as racist, bigoted xenophobes — 
and yes, clearly, some of them are 
this way — but why might scores of 
people have voted for him in spite of 
concerns about his language?

If you did vote for Trump, 

consider why such a vast portion of 
the United States didn’t. Understand 
why, overwhelmingly, people of 
color, Latinx, Muslims, coalitions 
of women, those who identify as 
LGBTQ+ and more are so upset. 
Understand why they feel unsafe.

Trump’s diction throughout his 

campaign, intentionally or not, has 
seemingly made these contingencies 
even more subject to discrimination, 
hate and violence than they were 
before. We’ve seen it in our Ann 
Arbor bubble, and the reality is, 
many who have been and are being 
marginalized feel that having voted 
for our president-elect constitutes 
tacit approval of these consequences.

Ultimately, then, now is not the 

time for either disillusionment or 
reticence. These will exacerbate 
political stratification and othering — 
which we cannot afford.

If you signed the “#notmycampus” 

petition, I think you’re misguided. 
You don’t get to call “microagression” 
when it suits your agenda, but decry 
an 
overly 
sensitive, 
“politically 

correct” country when your status 
quo is challenged.

If you’re so upset by the election’s 

outcome that you declare Trump 
is “not my president” and the U.S. 
is “not my country,” I think you 
may be misguided, too. People of 
all backgrounds talk about being 
disenfranchised by the system in 
one way or another, and the reality 
is that in democracy, we are all part 
of the system in some capacity, even 
when we feel outcast. Accepting 
this isn’t easy, especially when the 
institutional odds are historically 
stacked against you.

Instead of retreating to our corners, 

let’s talk to each other. It’ll be hard. 
Emotional. At times, triggering. But it 
will be necessary if we have any hope 
for some semblance of reconciliation. 
I think it’s going to require adopting 
certain 
practices 
that 
common 

opponents of “political correctness” 
hate: creating safe spaces, dispersing 
trigger warnings and acknowledging 
microaggressions when applicable.

Before you write these concepts 

off, consider that labels tend to be 
more divisive than the concepts 
they define. Some say trigger 
warnings and safe spaces are 
soft excuses for avoiding conflict. 
But, if I suggested that we warn 
students before a screening of 
“A Clockwork Orange” (which 
contains graphic rape scenes) that 
its content could prove traumatic 

for victims of sexual assault, I 
doubt I’d be rebuked. If I suggested 
implementing a judgment-free zone 
for people to ask difficult questions 
about race for which they may feel 
apprehensive, ignorant or just plain 
stupid, my conjecture is that few 
would object.

Don’t 
recuse 
yourself 
from 

dialogue 
that 
makes 
you 

uncomfortable. Be open to ideas 
you may disagree with, or even 
those which may offend you, so that 
we may find the common ground 
underlying opposing positions. On 
matters of policy, know that it’s OK 
if we don’t resolve our differences, 
but on matters of humanity, know 
that doing so is imperative.

We should all be outraged by the 

crime alerts of the last few days. So, 
regardless of your political affiliation, 
be an ally to the marginalized. This 
is a term with which I wasn’t all that 
familiar until recently, and I turned 
to my Facebook friends to help me 
define it. They said “allying oneself” 
to the marginalized entails listening 
to them; protesting alongside them 
even when our experiences are not 
shared; advocating fairness, equality 
and equity; intervening when we 
come into contact with family, 
friends, acquaintances and strangers 
alike who push unjust rhetoric or 
ideology at the expense of others.

It’s about asking people how you 

can be helpful, even if you don’t 
relate to what they’re going through. 
Really, being an “ally” is just having 
basic human decency. We are all 
capable of that.

The result of this election is set in 

stone, and we need to work together 
to 
move 
forward 
from 
here. 

Facebook posts and catchy Twitter 
hashtags aren’t enough. Subversions 
of our democratic systems, like 
petitioning the Electoral College 
to change the outcome, aren’t the 
answer either. Conversations with 
homogenous groups who share our 
opinions will only further divide us.

Do you want change? Let’s be 

good to each other, even when we 
disagree. Let’s do our homework. 
Read newspapers, get civically 
involved, vote and start listening. 
We can do this.

O

n Tuesday, the Black Student Union organized a “Being Black at the University of Michigan” 
campaign both on social media and University spaces, where Black students were encouraged to 
tweet and share their experiences of being Black at the University. The #BBUM campaign is just one 

of many student movements to point to declining minority enrollment and a lack of support from University 
administration as instrumental in creating a hostile racial climate. Since Michigan is devoted promoting and 
nurturing a diverse institution, the administration should demonstrate this commitment by requiring all 
freshman to take a course concerning contemporary identity issues.

It’s all but impossible to 

calculate the finite value of 
an education. At my middle-
class high school in Michigan, 
one of the biggest pitches that 
teachers and administrators 
made to try and convince more 
of my peers to attend college 
relied purely on economics.

“College grads make more,” 

they said.

While that may typically be 

true, the fluctuating economy 
and subsequent job market 
doesn’t make attending a four-
year university a sure bet. 
Laying thousands of dollars on 
the table just to get a job can 
even seem paradoxical. Borrow 
money to pay for school, get a 
job, profit. Then pay the money 
back.

But universities shouldn’t 

be seen as manufacturers of 
employees. Students shouldn’t 
look back after graduation 
and weigh the cost of a college 
against the job prospects they 
were able to line up by their 
first month as an alum.

Education benefits society 

as a whole. No one’s chances 
of finding a job would improve 
if everyone in America held a 
bachelor’s degree, but the way 
our country would operate 
culturally 
and 
politically 

would transform and for the 
better.

For 
example, 
Pamela 

Brandwein, a political science 
professor here at the University, 
wrote a book on reinterpreting 
Reconstruction-era 
politics 

and history after the Civil War. 
Some of her work has been 
especially relevant this year.

After the Charleston church 

shooting in June, the nation 
entered a discussion about 
the Confederate flag. South 
Carolina lawmakers, and the 
nation, 
debated 
the 
flag’s 

meaning; one side claiming it as 
a symbol of Southern heritage, 
while 
others 
passionately 

bemoaned against the state’s 
use of a flag that stood for a 
nation founded upon acute 
racism and slavery.

In a resoundingly American 

fashion, we couldn’t even agree 
on what the ol’ stars and bars 
represent. The Civil War has 
been over for nearly one and a 

half centuries, but we haven’t 
been able to reach a consensus 
on what it was about. 

I remember being taught 

(shout 
out 
public 
school) 

that the Civil War was about 
slavery. I also remember being 
taught that this was too simple 
of a summation, that slavery 
was the big issue, but really 
state’s rights were what was on 
the line for the Confederacy.

And then I entered Brandwein’s 

class, and I re-learned two 
things. 
First, 
yes 
the 
Civil 

War was indeed fought over 
slavery, period. The prevailing 
sentiment in the South was that 
slavery was an institution of the 
utmost importance because the 
unlimited source of free labor was 
supposed to be the cornerstone 
upon which a Southern utopia 
(for white folks) was built.

Secondly, political forces have 

the power to reshape history and 
affect our cultural understanding 
of it for decades and generations 
to come. After the Civil War, the 
loudest and most boisterous pro-
slavery guys recognized a sinking 
ship when they were standing on 
it and began the line of rhetoric 
about states’ rights as the cause 
for 
the 
war. 
Unfortunately, 

they were successful, and this 
incorrect 
interpretation 
of 

history still exists around high 
school classrooms and water 
coolers today.

Thanks, professor, for clearing 

that up.

Brandwein 
isn’t 
the 
first 

scholar, historian or journalist to 
pin down the truth about slavery 
and the Civil War. But in the 
public, we still see its significance 
as something that’s up for debate. 
To drive a point home, anyone 
who believes the Civil War wasn’t 
a war about slavery is wrong. But 
the truth, though made relatively 
accessible 
to 
undergraduates 

here and at other universities, 
isn’t as easy to come across in the 
real world.

Society 
has 
entered 
full-

force into the information age, 
and everyone is surrounded by 
accessible data. While there’s a 
lot of good that comes from this, 
there are now more channels 
than ever to launch a marketing 
campaign to sway public opinion. 
The ability of self-interested 
actors to control what story gets 
told in the newspapers and on TV 
has made it incredibly difficult to 

find out what is really going on.

Pick an issue: Black Lives 

Matter, Occupy Wall Street, 
Detroit’s bankruptcy — it doesn’t 
matter. Each person and each 
news 
outlet 
frames 
things 

differently. And there have been 
countless cases where powerful 
people have lied to the public 
with their own motives in mind. 

“I am not a crook,” said 

Richard Nixon.

Even with the brightest minds 

examining an event, like with 
the Civil War example, lies 
and political spin can slip past 
American common sense and 
become, for better or, more often, 
worse, part of what we accept as 
fact. We then carry on with an 
incorrect understanding of what 
is true and what happened.

Knowing this, the high volume 

of lies and political pandering 
should 
cause 
anyone 
from 

Portland, Maine, to Portland, 
Ore., to think more critically 
about 
the 
information 
they 

consume.

In an educated society, we 

would all have the skills to at 
least do this. Making more 
people college graduates benefits 
the greater good. A college 
education exposes each person to 
perspectives, ideas and concepts 
they otherwise may not have 
stumbled upon. Students absorb 
all of this information and take 
it with them to parties, coffee 
shops and, eventually, society in 
some form or another.

In a time where privilege is 

defined by access to opportunity, 
being educated turns over a blank 
page for new ideas and ways of 
thinking. If more people had 
access to education, it could aid 
in turning the echo chamber of 
social media unoriginality, bias 
and uninformed public opinion 
into something more symphonic. 
And 
more 
importantly, 
it 

undercuts 
the 
ability 
of 

politicians and billionaires to 
sell their own versions of history 
and manipulate the masses into 
acting or believing certain ways.

Above all else, receiving an 

education may not get you a 
job, but it can provide some 
direction amid all the chaos and 
half the production of lemmings 
(the video game people, not the 
animals). Because as the late, 
great Yogi Berra said, “If you 
don’t know where you are going, 
you’ll wind up someplace else.”

Wilson would not be indicted in 
the death of teenager Michael 
Brown. It has since been revised 
for publication in The Michigan 
Daily.

I am usually not one to use 

Facebook as a platform to 
share my own voice. I might 
repost things I find funny or 
exciting, artistic and beautiful, 
reassuring. Repost about issues 
that are relevant and important 
that reflect my thinking and 
beliefs, but when it comes to 
my own voice on this particular 
platform, I have been silent.

But tonight, on this grave 

night, when my hands and 

heart tremble, there is no other 
time that might merit a greater 
reason to speak out than this.

We all know what happened 

months ago. We all know what 
happened tonight. We are all 
reacting in some capacity.

I’m thankful for the voices 

that resonate with my own, the 
words I can snap to. It reminds 
me that I am not alone, that we 
are not alone. That we matter.

And while I am hurt and 

angered by those voices that are 
dead set that this man is innocent, 
that this circumstance is not 
about race, these arguments are 
irrelevant to the matter and not 
only is there no room to discuss 
this, there is negative room to 
discuss this. 

Then there are those who 

believe they are not reacting at 
all. Those who have the power 
and privilege to look away. I 

would just like to say that your 
passivity might be the biggest 
reaction of them all. Neutrality is 
the greatest threat to a world that 
might one day be just and free 
to all. This silence perpetuates a 

system in which accountability 
and 
responsibility 
are 
not 

required and tells those who 
believe that this is anything less 
than a tragedy that they are right.

There is no more room for 

passivity 
and 
complacency. 

There is no ‘neutral’ where 
human rights are concerned, only 
responsibility. 

This is not the time to police 

and criticize the reactions of a 
people beaten and broken down 
by a system in a country and 
society built on their backs and 
their blood. And please spare me 
arguments about how slavery 
is irrelevant. The institution 
of 
slavery 
helped 
create 
a 

system where Black bodies are 
seen as subhuman and where 
unlawful Black death is justified, 
rewarded and upheld socially, 
institutionally and politically. 
This is the mess slavery — and 
the violent distorted thinking 
and bloody actions that produced 
it — made. We’ll stop talking 
about it when its residual effects 
are cleaned up.

Tonight I am ill with sadness 

and trauma. I believed that 
maybe we might have made it 
a little farther than we’d come 
before.

I am pained to admit that I 

was sorely mistaken and am 
now perplexed by this massive 
question of where we go from 
here. What do we do now?

I may — we may — have been 

wrong in thinking our justice 
system would move away from 
its haunting history and surprise 
us with hope for the future, but 
I believe I am right about one 
thing: This time is different. The 
difference not being in a system 
that consistently fails us — but 
the difference being in a people 
tired of being failed. We have 
changed; we are the difference; 
we have the power to be the 
change. 

This cannot be put to bed. 

They wanted us to forget but 

we cannot allow them to bury 
us, to bury this. We must keep 
organizing, 
keep 
speaking, 

yelling, screaming, until we are 
heard. 
Marching, 
stomping, 

pounding, shaking the ground 
until the system has no choice 
but to break.

And by we I mean all. This is 

not a Black issue; this is a human 
issue, as all violations of human 
rights are. We did not enslave 
ourselves. We need just as many 
bodies that helped get us here to 
help us get free.

I live by this always and I will 

say it a dozen times over:

“The only way to deal with 

an unfree world is to become so 
absolutely free that your very 
existence is an act of rebellion” —
Albert Camus

I will be a rebellion. I will be 

a revolution.

I hope y’all will join me.

‘Cooking for Jeffery:’ An 
iconic American love story 

By KATHLEEN DAVIS

Managing Arts Editor 2016

Ina Garten is a powerhouse.
When the Food Network 

train 
hit 
new 
heights 
of 

popularity in the mid-aughts, 
Garten reached a new level of 
celebrity status attained by 
only a few other chefs on the 
network. 
Her 
long-running 

series, 
“Barefoot 
Contessa,” 

has been on air since 2002, 
making it one of the longest 
running series on the network.

In each episode, Garten is 

effortlessly charming as she 
cooks a meal for a special guest 
— be it friends, a celebrity or 
her longtime husband, Jeffrey. 
Ina and Jeffrey’s relationship 
has reached an almost cult 
status, as the pair (who have 
been married since 1968) have 
a chemistry that would make 
any cynic a believer in true 
love. When so many marriages 
end in divorce these days, 
how can we not rally around a 
couple who has made it work 
for almost 50 years?

It was no surprise, then, 

that Garten’s 10th cookbook, 
released last month, is titled 
“Cooking for Jeffrey.” The 
glossy hardcover is two parts 
cookbook, one part love story. 
The introduction traces the 
history of Garten’s relationship 
with 
cooking 
and 
her 

relationship with Jeffrey. The 
two things are inextricably 
interconnected, Garten says. 
According to her, Jeffrey was 
the one who encouraged her 
to work in the food industry 
and pursue her dreams in the 
public sphere.

Jeffrey is no stranger to 

attaining lofty goals himself; 
he’s Dean Emeritus at the Yale 
School of Management, and has 
worked in several presidential 
administrations. Not to be 
outdone 
by 
her 
husband, 

Garten 
has 
an 
extremely 

impressive resume from before 
her venture into the food world. 
She worked in the White House 
during the Ford and Carter 
administrations writing policy 
papers on nuclear energy. In 
the words of Garten herself, 
“how great is that?”

On first glance, I joked to 

my friends that the title of 
the cookbook seemed bad for 
feminism. 
I 
never 
thought 

badly about Ina for it — 
Garten is old enough to be my 
grandmother, and I am well 
aware of how gender roles 
have shifted since she was 
in college. However, I was 
surprised to see her actually 
tackle the topic of feminism in 
her introduction: “I often say 
[Jeffrey] was the first feminist 
I ever knew; he believed that I 
could do anything I wanted to 
do.”

The 
couple’s 
mutually 

beneficial 
relationship 
is 

highlighted several times in 
“Cooking for Jeffrey.” It’s one 
thing to see their relationship 
on television, where Ina is 
queen of the kitchen and 
Jeffrey seems happy just to 
be on the receiving end of her 
production. It’s a completely 
different thing to read Garten’s 
heartfelt gratitude for finding 
a relationship that allows both 
people to follow their goals 
while loving each other deeply.

While 
flipping 
through 

“Cooking with Jeffrey,” I was 
fascinated that not only did 
every recipe sound delicious, 
but 
they 
all 
looked 
like 

something I, an amateur home 
cook, could whip up without 
too much trouble. One of the 
reasons Ina Garten has become 
a Food Network icon is her 
penchant for simple meals 
that require ingredients you 
probably have in your fridge. 
While there are recipes that 
require a thoughtfully planned 
grocery run (“Fried Oysters 
with Lemon Saffron Aioli,” for 
instance), most of the recipes 
are 
something 
you 
could 

easily make with a few hours 
notice. In Ina’s recount of her 
culinary history, she explains 
that she finds the best meals 
are often the simplest, coming 
from perfected classic recipes. 
This explains the prevalence 
of meals with humble names 
like 
“Roast 
Chicken 
with 

Radishes,” 
“Parmeasan 

Roasted 
Zucchini,” 
and 

“Roasted Italian Meatballs.”

For a television personality, 

Garten has done a wonderful 

job making her audience feel 
like they share an intimate 
connection with her. Skimming 
through the blurbs written at 
the top of each recipe, I found 
myself reading some of her 
iconic phrases in her voice, 
like I was watching the recipe 
unfold on her show (“How 
smart is that?”). It’s hard to 
tell if you want her to be your 
grandmother, or your mother, 
or your Hampton neighbor. 
But the overwhelming reaction 
is that her fans do want her 
in their life in some capacity 
becauseshe seems like such a 
fun and friendly person. Her 
voice translates nicely from 
“Barefoot Contessa” to her 
cookbooks, a hard-to-achieve 
skill that has certainly been 
perfected from years in the 
business.

Sitting down with “Cooking 

for Jeffrey” is the reading 
equivalent of curling up in 
a blanket next to a fire — 
the warmth Ina has for her 
husband and her love for 
cooking 
radiates 
off 
every 

page. Even for the biggest 
skeptic, there is something 
beautiful about hearing how 
two people fell (and stayed) 
in love. “Cooking for Jeffrey” 
not only offers a glimpse into 
the first few years of Ina and 
Jeffrey’s relationship, but you 
can rest easy knowing the story 
has a happy ending almost five 
decades later.

As Garten reminds us in her 

“Planning a Party” chapter, 
food is no fun unless you’re 
sharing it with the people you 
love, be it friends, family or 
Jeffrey. Cooking for others 
is a selfless act that can be 
deeply 
personal, 
and 
the 

ritual of sharing a meal is only 
productive if we’re building 
on our relationship with that 
person through conversation 
and 
laughter. 
Though 

especially important in this 
political climate, this lesson is 
something that each and every 
one of us should hold deeply. 
Besides, if we learn anything 
about sustaining a marriage 
from 
Ina 
and 
Jeffrey’s 

relationship, 
it’s 
undeniable 

that sharing lots of delicious 
meals has only helped.

There is no ‘neutral’ 
where human rights 
are concerned, only 

responsibility.

If I could see all 
my friends tonight

Claudia Rankine to talk 
about ‘Citizen’ at Rackham

By LAUREN THEISEN

Daily Music Columnist 2017

I used to listen to “All My 

Friends” by LCD Soundsystem 
and dream about when I would feel 
nostalgic for it. If you have never 
listened to LCD, “All My Friends” 
is its magnum opus, a bullet train 
of a song that’s undeniably one of 
the best of its generation. Over an 
unstoppable, unchanging piano 
rhythm and the slowly increasing 
crescendo of drums, synth and 
guitar, James Murphy — the unof-
ficial spokesman of the lost, aging 
New York hipster — meditates on 
growing old while still trying to 
live the fast life.

“You spend the first five years 

trying to get with the plan / And 
the next five years trying to be 
with your friends again,” he sings. 
“We’re running out of the drugs,” 
he continues. “and the conversa-
tion’s winding away.” Then there’s 
the line that received crazed 
cheers at their supposed farewell 
show back in 2011: “To tell the 
truth / This could be the last time.” 
And the repeating refrain to close 
out the song — “If I could see all 
my friends tonight…” — before the 
music seems to disappear into a 
puff of smoke.

My senior year of high school 

was, of course, filled with good-
byes — but not really. I went off to 
a school that’s a 30 minute drive 
from where I grew up, if traffic is 
bad. I came here with over a dozen 
classmates I knew well. I still see 
several regularly, and I keep in 
touch with plenty more. I’m kind 
of proud of the fact that I have 

only really “lost” a small handful 
of friends, and even these discon-
nections felt more-or-less natural.

“All My Friends” was a fantas-

tic song, one that grabbed me and 
didn’t let go for seven-and-a-half 
minutes, but it never conjured 
up any specific memories. It was 
never mainstream enough to be 
a song I danced to with people. It 
never soundtracked a celebratory 
occasion. It mainly just stayed in 
my pocket on my “Top 25 Most 
Played” iPod playlist.

Through college, I always 

seemed to make a special point 
of listening to it at the end of the 
summer, usually when I realized 
I was driving around Livonia for 
the last time in a while. It turned 
into a ceremonial thing — I’d turn 
it up loud and try to inhabit the 
lyrics, even though I was usually 
just making a mundane trip to 
a grocery store or library. Each 
time, I felt like the song would 
touch some part of me that need-
ed to connect, but even though I 
enjoyed the goofy devotion of the 
whole practice, I don’t know if I 
can say that it ever quite moved 
me.

The line Murphy sings that 

always sticks out to me when I lis-
ten is the classic: “I wouldn’t trade 
one stupid decision / For another 
five years of life.” It’s tailor-made 
for a high school yearbook quote, 
and I always, every time I listen, 
think about whether it’s true.

2016 was the first year I started 

noticing the ages of celebrities 
who died. I subtracted my age 
from theirs and wondered what 
fraction of my life had already 
been lived — and whether I could 

comprehend the amount of time I 
theoretically had left. More press-
ingly, I checked to see if they were 
younger than my parents, and if 
they were, I searched for mitigat-
ing factors and tried to find relief 
in the revelations that these 
famous people smoked cigarettes 
or lived otherwise unhealthy 
lifestyles.

I have made a lot of stupid 

decisions in my life, only some 
of which turned out to be good 
stories later. There are hospital 
trips that could have been avoid-
ed; there’s that time I slammed a 
door on a friend and almost broke 
her mirror; the multiple times I 
spilled wine on carpets.

What I’m trying to say is that 

I don’t think I actually identify 
with “All My Friends.” Murphy 
sings like an everyman, and his 
arrangement is visionary, so 
it’s the kind of song any lover of 
music can appreciate. There’s a 
certain anticipation, though, that 
I have whenever I queue it up — 
I’m looking forward to powerful 
emotions. I’m ready to feel some-
thing that never quite hits.

But now, I’m ready for actual 

goodbyes. The friends I never 
really left in high school are 
getting jobs out of state. I just 
finished up my time at the first 
job I ever loved. I’ll leave for the 
summer without the certainty of 
returning to see the same people 
again.

I’ll finally be able to say “To 

tell the truth / This could be 
the last time and mean it,” and 
I can’t help feeling like at some 
point soon I’m going to listen to 
LCD Soundsystem and actually, 

Searching for hope 

on a TV screen

By MARIA ROBBINS-

SOMERVILLE

Daily Arts Writer 2017

According to author Claudia 

Rankine, the inception of her 
book-length poem, “Citizen: An 
American Lyric,” began with the 
question: “How did that happen?” 
Something of an investigation, 
the poem opens with secondhand 
prose poetry cataloguing the 
lived experience of racism among 
Rankine’s friends and colleagues.

“I just wanted to see if people 

were sensitive to the fact that 
every day in small ways, they 
were 
themselves 
engaged 
in 

actions that were annihilating 
other people’s human rights, their 
rights to be here as a citizen and 
as a person in the world,” Rankine 
said in a phone interview with the 
Michigan Daily.

As part of the Martin Luther 

King Day Symposium, Claudia 
Rankine, poet, professor and 
MacArthur fellow, will present on 
“Citizen” published in 2014. The 
event will take place in Rackham 
auditorium, hosted by the U-M 
Racism Lab. “Citizen” is the first 
and only book of poetry to ever 
be named on the New York Times 
nonfiction bestseller list as well as 
the recipient of the NAACP award 
and PEN Open Book Award. The 
poem explores the brutal lived 
experience of structural racism 
against Black Americans.

“Reading on Martin Luther 

King Day is always for me, 
an honor, because it puts me 
conversation 
with 
one 
of 

America’s greatest leaders, and 
not only a great leader in terms 
of Civil Rights, but for me he is a 
great leader in terms of human 
rights. He’s an example to us all,” 
Rankine said.

It is more than fitting that 

Rankine read on MLK day, as her 
work deals with the profound 
urgency of the country’s increasing 
need for humanity and reversal of 
racist policy and practice. The way 
“Citizen” challenges poetic form 
is inseparable from the way it 
challenges the forms of oppressive 
sociopolitical 
structures 
in 

American society.

The form of the poem is deeply 

interdisciplinary and interweaves 
personal narrative, image and 
news-style evidence. One section 
lists names of black Americans 
whose lives were taken by police 
brutality, the words fading from 
the page as the poem progresses. 
The poem is haunting and direct, 
elucidating the ways in which the 
recipients of such constant and 
inhumane treatment wear the 
oppression on their bodies.

As a recipient of a MacArthur 

Genius grant, Rankine will be 
broadening her commitment to 
interdisciplinary work in founding 
the “Racial Imaginary Institute” 
in New York, a gallery space to 
explore race.

“Our name ‘racial imaginaries’ 

is meant to capture the enduring 
truth of race that is an invented 
concept 
that 
operates 
with 

extraordinary force in our daily 
lives, limiting our movements 
and imaginations. We understand 
that perceptions, resources, rights 
and minds themselves flow along 
racial lines that confront some 
of us and give others unchecked 
power. These lines are drawn and 
maintained by white dominance,” 
Rankine, in describing the work of 
the Institute, said.

Although many read Rankine’s 

work as a call for social change, she 
explained that she does not think 
that the artist’s responsibility 
to elicit a certain reaction or 
response from an audience.

She put it simply: “I’m not into 

any prescriptive definition when it 
comes to being an artist.”

The book’s powerful statement 

on the experience of racism in 
America merges the personal 
and political in a way that has 
resonated with both timelessness 
and an eerie timeliness. The 
text places present-day micro-
aggressions against black lives 
and beside text and images that 
allude to the era of Jim Crow 
laws, all culminating in poetry 
that 
unleashes 
something 
so 

personally and persistently felt.

Near the end of the poem 

Rankine writes, “That time and 
that time and that time the outside 
blistered the inside of you, words 
outmaneuvered years, had you in 
a chokehold, every part roughed 
up, the eyes dripping.” In this 
moment, the immensity of history 
and politics upholds a visceral 
pain that is at once personal and 
shared.

In this, the poet makes no 

real distinction between artistic 
intention that is or is not political.

“I think that politics are part 

of life so they are unavoidable, 
so we don’t need to go out of our 
way to avoid them or engage 
them,” Rankine said. “They’re 
part of our life, our history, our 
day to day living. They determine 
everything. I think writers and 
artists need to do what they 
do for themselves, to write 
from the place of most honesty, 
imaginative, possibility that they 
can envision themselves in, but 
they can’t avoid politics whether 
or not they think they’re doing 
it.” 

Rankine will be appearing 

both at Rackham Auditorium 
Monday evening and at the 
Institute for Social Research 
Tuesday morning where she will 
talk about her ongoing research 
on racism in America.

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily TV Columnist 2016

In the past two weeks since 

Donald Trump was elected the next 
president of the United States, my 
weekly TV schedule has seemed 
less important than ever. Sure, TV 
is good for escapism, but in the face 
of such horrific things happening in 
the real world, whether I’ll catch up 
on “How to Get Away with Murder” 
or make time to binge “Transparent” 
suddenly seems trivial.

Of course, I quickly remembered 

that in times of political turmoil, 
art is more important than ever. 
A wealth of smart pieces have 
been written about this already. 
Genevieve Koski recently quoted 
Roger Ebert’s famous speech in 
which he claims, “the movies 
are like a machine that generates 
empathy,” arguing that by setting 
out to engage with every piece of pop 
culture we encounter, we become 
more understanding people. The 
Michigan Daily’s own Dayton Hare 
suggested that artists are obligated 
to “bring people together into the 
oneness of human existence.”

As I caught up on my shows 

recently, I realized that part of the 
reason I assumed Hillary Clinton 
would become president is that I 
watch an overwhelming amount 
of progressive, liberal-minded TV. 
Most of my favorite new fall shows 
have female leads — “Fleabag” and 
“The Good Place,” for example. Most 
of my favorite returning shows have 
predominantly female casts with a 
wealth of roles for women of color, 
like “Jane the Virgin” and “Orange 
is the New Black.” Hollywood most 
definitely still has a long way to go 
in terms of bringing marginalized 
groups to the screen — just look at 
last year’s Oscars controversy — but 
we’re in a period of unprecedented 
onscreen diversity. Being so used to 
that diversity, so used to the feminist 
beliefs I see regularly espoused 
on my favorite shows, has only 
emphasized how much of a bubble 
I live in.

Living in a bubble can have 

negative 
consequences 
if 
you 

assume the rest of the world is the 
same as yours, but I don’t mean to 
say that these progressive shows got 

Trump elected. With the impending 
Trump presidency, it’s crucial that 
we continue to work to populate 
the TV landscape with people of all 
races, sexualities, gender identities 
and ages. Still, though — in this time 
of darkness, I remember how far TV 
and movies have come, and it gives 
me hope.

Take the recent trend of casual 

abortions on TV. In the past few 
weeks, three shows have featured 
women who make the decision to 
terminate their pregnancies without 
fanfare or excessive agonizing. Too 
often, abortion is portrayed as an 
absolute last resort, a tragic decision 
that women should only make in the 
case of rape or some particularly 
vulgar circumstance. Lindsay from 
“You’re the Worst” may be a terrible 
partner and a terrible person, but 
ultimately her choice to get an 
abortion is the sanest choice she’s 
made this season. Lindsay knows 
it would be irresponsible to raise a 
child with a man who frequently 
revolts her, and it would be cruel 
to use a child to force herself into 
staying in a marriage she doesn’t 
really want.

Meanwhile, what’s revolutionary 

about seeing Lindsay or Paula 
from “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” or 
Xiomara from “Jane the Virgin” 
get an abortion is that these women 
aren’t rape survivors, or teens who 
accidentally get pregnant and have 
to “pay the consequences.” These 
are 
middle-aged 
women 
who 

emphatically don’t want to have 
more children, so they choose not to. 
It’s that simple.

I 
also 
recently 
watched 

“Moonlight,” a film that’s so 
personal, layered and subversive 
that I don’t even know how to 
begin to explain its radicalness. 
“Moonlight” isn’t exactly a feel-
good movie, but I left the theater in 
awe, convinced that writer-director 
Barry Jenkins was capable of really 
changing the way people think 
about race and sexuality.

Of all the art I’ve taken in since 

Nov. 8, though, nothing provoked so 
visceral and immediate a reaction 
in me as the season finale of “Better 
Things.” 
“Better 
Things” 
has 

brought tears to my eyes in more 
than half its episodes, but I was still 
shocked at my own reaction when I 

watched the last scene. As Sam and 
her daughters sing along to “Only 
Women Bleed” by Alice Cooper, 
the camera cuts to a wide shot of 
their minivan barreling down the 
highway, a single line of text below 
closing out the season: “dedicated to 
my daughters.”

There was something about that 

line that made me tear up every 
time I even remembered it for the 
rest of the day — something about 
the simplicity of it, the way it felt so 
quiet and elegant yet so enormously 
important. At the end of the day, 
we want our daughters to feel like 
they’re understood and respected 
and loved — not just because they’re 
our daughters, but because they’re 
people.

As 
an 
upper-middle 
class, 

straight, 
white 
male, 
I 
am 

the apotheosis of privilege. If 
“Moonlight” profoundly affected 
me, I can’t imagine how it must 
feel to be a gay Black boy watching 
his own identity — an identity 
rarely acknowledged, onscreen 
or otherwise — come to life. And 
as emotional as it made me, the 
dedication in “Better Things” must 
mean more to the women who 
see it, women who are regularly 
denigrated 
with 
cumulative 

microaggressions and explicitly 
hateful acts of violence.

Of course, we can’t let inclusive 

TV trick us into thinking the whole 
world is this open-minded. More 
importantly, we can’t let ourselves 
subside into complacency just 
because watching a show with 
an all-Black cast gives us the 
superficial appearance of social 
activists. I’m not advocating for 
ignoring reality and being blindly 
optimistic about the state of our 
country just because “Atlanta” and 
“Insecure” have been renewed for 
second seasons. I just think that 
in a time when it can be so hard 
to even log onto Twitter without 
seeing some heinous news pointing 
toward massive societal regression, 
the increasingly progressive state 
of TV is a small, hopeful sign. 
Sometimes, all you need to regain 
your faith in humanity is a little 
sign: a shot of a Black boy drenched 
in moonlight, or a four-word 
dedication. Sometimes, little signs 
are all we have.

Instant classic, eternal anguish

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor 2016

COLUMBUS — The play was 

called 29 lead.

Curtis Samuel took a handoff 

going left. His blockers created 
a tunnel. He burst through it, 
jumped over the goal line and 
stretched his hands as wide as 
he could to the fans in the north 
end zone.

It may go down in history 

as one of the enduring plays in 
one of college football’s great 
rivalries — not because it was 
exceptionally drawn up (though 
it was), but because it ended an 
iconic game that may outlive 
those who saw it live.

The nation’s No. 2 team beat 

the No. 3 team, and then fans 
stormed the field. That doesn’t 
happen in games where the 
home team is favored. But this 
was Ohio State and Michigan, 
with the highest stakes in a 
decade. No celebration was 
unworthy.

That’s the significance of 

what happened at Ohio Stadium 
on Saturday: Ohio State 30, 
Michigan 27.

There will be time to 

rehash what was or wasn’t. 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
offered plenty of thoughts in 
the moments following the 
game, when he said he was 
“bitterly disappointed” with 
the officiating. He thought one 
hold went uncalled, one pass-
interference was called unjustly 

and one spot — on fourth down 
in double overtime, no less — 
should have given his team a 
victory. None of it matters. None 
of it’s changing.

It took two overtimes for the 

Buckeyes to beat Michigan, but 
they did it. They twisted the 
most jagged of knives through 
the hearts of those who dared 
to hope. They did it in the last 
game of the regular season, and 
they did it in a year where the 
Wolverines looked like one of the 
nation’s four best teams.

Ohio State coach Urban 

Meyer called it an instant 
classic, and 
he’s right. 
Harbaugh 
said the 
implications 
of the 
rivalry 
weren’t on 
his mind. 
Both are 
probably 
true. That’s 
because instant classics don’t 
happen without heartbreak, 
“bitter disappointment” or 
whatever you’d like to call it. 
The ingredients of despair and 
ecstasy are exactly the same.

In his postgame press 

conference, Harbaugh stuck 
up his hands and showed how 
far from the first down he 
thought J.T. Barrett was on a 
double-overtime 4th-and-1. 
With Ohio State down three, 
Barrett rushed forward, took 

low contact from Delano Hill, 
and stretched toward the first-
down marker.

Afterward, Harbaugh asked 

reporters what they saw on 
the TVs upstairs. “Short,” they 
agreed. The referees did not. 
They saw Barrett collide into 
Hill and fall just over the line 
of gain. The replay officials 
did not see enough to overturn 
it. That’s how these things 
go. Harbaugh has a legitimate 
gripe, but legitimate gripes are 
worth exactly zero wins.

Instead, they are worth 

years, even decades, of 

anguish. Harbaugh 
may be able to 
eventually rid 
himself of that 
burden with other 
games, other calls 
that do go his way 
and maybe even a 
championship. But 
he will never be 
able to undo what 
happened on the 

north side of Ohio Stadium on 
Saturday.

His team might have avoided 

it by gaining more than 
just five yards in the fourth 
quarter, or not committing 
one of its three turnovers, 
one of which occurred at the 
Buckeyes’ 1-yard line. But it’s 
too late for all that. Nothing 
will ever change the outcome. 
The game will be preserved, 
exactly the way it unfolded, for 
eternity.

After Harbaugh expressed 

his displeasures, Meyer held 
court in the southeast corner 
of the stadium. It couldn’t 
have been more different. 
There was Meyer, the victor, 
entirely flummoxed. He was 
asked all kinds of questions, 
including what he thought his 
chances were when his team 
was down 17-7 in the third 
quarter.

“I don’t know,” he 

responded. “We won the 
game.”

As the questions continued, 

Meyer found refuge in a 
clever response. Asked about 
an unsuccessful fake punt 
call, he said: “On the last 
play, we ran a stretch to the 
left. It’s 29 lead, is the call, 
and Curtis scored.” Asked 
about his health, he started, 
“Curtis…” before laughter 
finished the sentence for 
him. On if he remembered 
anything from after the game: 
“Yeah, Curtis scored.”

It was that simple for 

Meyer. Harbaugh didn’t even 
mention the play.

That’s the difference 

between being on the 
winning and losing ends 
of a game like Saturday’s. 
Harbaugh is left looking 
back on what went wrong, 
remembering the calls that 
could have been different. 
Meyer doesn’t have to 
remember anything. History 
will do it for him.

Charmingly fun until the photo finish

INDIANAPOLIS — Moments 

after the game, the sun is low in 
the sky and Lucas Oil Stadium 
casts a long shadow across 
Indianapolis as, inside, Michigan 
walks off the court for the last 
time together. Jordan Morgan 
is first, well before anyone else. 
Glenn Robinson III gives a quick 
wave to the crowd and puts 
his head down. Nik Stauskas is 
emotionless. Mitch McGary, who 
was never getting into the game, 
walks off wearing the uniform 
his teammates have insisted he 
wear.

Later, Morgan, held up by 

his press conference, is one of 
the last to enter the Michigan 
locker room. Most of the room is 
composed except for Zak Irvin, 
who is emotional in one corner 
of the room, and for Morgan. He 
wipes his face with his sleeve and 
cries in front of the television 
cameras.

His 
teammates 
have 
said 

the loss is all the more difficult 
because it means they’ll never 
play another game with Morgan. 
The senior doesn’t know how to 
respond.

He pauses to wipe his eyes.
“I didn’t expect it to be my last 

game,” Morgan says.

“It’s over. I don’t know what 

else to say.”

***
It’s over — much later than 

anyone 
anticipated. 
Without 

Trey 
Burke, 
without 
Tim 

Hardaway Jr., without McGary, 
this team didn’t just win the Big 
Ten. It dominated. It improved, 
steadily, each game. The pieces, 
especially offensively, meshed 
seamlessly.

A photo comes to mind now 

from the summer of 2012. The 
Michigan 
basketball 
team’s 

incoming class is posing together 
at the basketball facilities, maybe 
for the first time all together.

Caris 
LeVert 
is 
wearing 

cargo shorts. Spike Albrecht 
looks small, even next to the 
wiry LeVert. All have their 
arms around each other, except 
Robinson, who has his hands 
in his pockets and smiles big. 

McGary looks like a kid at 
summer camp. Stauskas stands at 
the edge and looks moody.

College basketball today is 

brutal in this regard. Jordan 
Morgans are rare. Play as well as 
Michigan has and you risk losing 
your best players. A two-year-
old photo feels like a sepia-toned 
memory. Almost certainly, some 
of those players will be gone next 
year.

***
It’s unclear what Michigan 

could 
have 
done 
differently 

against Kentucky. It’s unclear 
what Michigan could have done 
better. A few more box outs, 
maybe. Less foul trouble.

But Michigan played at just 

about its peak and stood with 
Kentucky’s size and talent and 
said beat this. And Kentucky did.

It was hard to ask much more 

from this team in this game, 
this season. Michigan’s big men, 
simply, weren’t big. Kentucky 
was too much to handle above 
the rim. The final six minutes 
on Sunday were the best 
basketball of this thoroughly 
entertaining tournament.

Michigan takes a timeout, 

down seven, the game slipping 
away. A pretty drive and kick 
back by LeVert finds Robinson 
open 
in 
the 
corner. 
His 

shooting has been inconsistent 
for most of the season. It’s 
good. Four-point game now.

Two 
possessions 
later, 

Morgan gets a put-back and 
the foul. Free throw good. One 
point game —and now we’re 
off.

Aaron 
Harrison 
three. 

Morgan dunk. Kentucky layup. 
Robinson 
layup. 
Kentucky 

layup. 
The 
under-four-

minutes 
television 
timeout 

feels 
akin 
to 
interrupting 

Mozart mid-symphony to sell 
a few extra bratwursts. Damn 
your television timeouts.

Back now. Stauskas makes 

both on a shooting foul. 
Harrison 
three. 
Robinson 

three. Nine possessions now 
without so much as a missed 
shot. How much fun is this?

Michigan needs two to tie 

now, so John Beilein takes a 
timeout. And then LeVert goes 

off. Stauskas misses a layup, but 
LeVert grabs it and dishes. Stauskas, 
again, from three rims out and 
LeVert slashes into the paint, dives 
after the ball and, falling backward, 
dishes back to Stauskas. Another 
miss, but a hand — likely that 
of Julius Randle of Kentucky — 
redirects the ball back in. Tie game.

This right here was Michigan’s 

season. A flawless, smart offense 
(the most efficient, ever, it turns 
out, at least since we’ve started 
keeping track of such stats); a 
socialist-like insistence on sharing 
the basketball; and more effort than 
defense. LeVert was not going to let 
Kentucky get the ball back before 
Michigan made a basket.

Then Aaron Harrison — that’s 

Aaron 
Bleeping 
Harrison, 
to 

translate for Ann Arbor readers 
— hit the shot of his young career. 
Stauskas’ prayer went short. And 
Kentucky won.

Michigan will be back here 

again. This feels more certain than 

it has in forever.

For Michigan, this hurt not 

because it gave Kentucky anything. 
It didn’t. It hurt not because it 
squandered a rare opportunity. It 
will come again.

It hurts because it won’t be 

with this team, this thoroughly 
surprising and likeable team. It 
hurts, because in college basketball 
today, teams like this are like 
comets — brilliant, breathtaking, 
brief. It hurts because that photo 
feels nostalgic. And it’s from 2012. 
It hurts because of Morgan.

Morgan is talking about this 

team in the press conference after 
the game. He’s the last one to speak 
before it’s over.

“Yeah, I mean, just this year has 

been the most fun time I’ve had, 
probably, playing basketball, ever,” 
he says.

It’s over now, and it hurts for 

Michigan, but I don’t know what 
else to say except: how much fun 
was that?

Jim Harbaugh 
welcomed as next 
‘M’ football coach

By MAX BULTMAN 

and 

GREG GARNO 

Daily Sports Editor and 

Daily Sports Writer 2014 

Jim Harbaugh’s first press 

conference 
as 
Michigan 

football 
coach 
was 
filled 

with laughter and clapping 
from the players, coaches and 
family looking on.

But the room of hundreds 

went quiet when Harbaugh 
was asked if he was inheriting 
a turnaround program.

“This 
is 
Michigan,” 

Harbaugh said. “There are 
no turnarounds at Michigan. 
This is greatness.”

He added in his statement: 

“Throughout my life I have 
dreamed of coaching at the 
University of Michigan. Now I 
have the honor to live it.”

The 
Michigan 
Athletic 

Department announced the 
hiring of the former San 
Francisco 
49ers 
coach 
on 

Tuesday afternoon, the 20th 
coach in program history. 
Harbaugh agreed to a seven-
year contract paying a base 
salary of $5 million per year.

Hoarse-voiced 
from 
a 

gatorade bath in his NFL-
finale Sunday, he handled his 
first press conference nearly 
an 
hour 
after 
addressing 

his team for the first time. 
Harbaugh 
didn’t 
give 
a 

timeline for when he planned 
to name a coaching staff.

A former quarterback under 

Bo Schembechler, Harbaugh 
was 
an 
All-American 
and 

Heisman 
Trophy 
finalist, 

but he’s been part of the 
Wolverines’ program since he 
was nine years old. Harbaugh’s 
father, Jack, was the defensive 
backs coach at Michigan while 
Jim was growing up.

It 
was 
then, 
Harbaugh 

said, that he first dreamed of 
coaching at Michigan.

“When I was nine to 10 

years old, there was a time 
when I was sitting in coach 
Schembechler’s office. I was 
sitting in his chair; I had my 
feet up on his desk,” Harbaugh 
recalled. “He walked in and 
said, ‘How ya doin’, Jim?’ And 
I said, ‘I’m doing great Bo, how 

you doin’? He said, ‘Whattaya 
doin?’ and I said, ‘I’m sitting 
in 
your 
chair, 
coach!’ 
... 

There’s just been times in my 
life where I’ve thought about 
it, dreamed about it, and now 
it’s time to live it.”

In addition to his $5 million 

base 
salary, 
Harbaugh’s 

contract includes incentives 
for playing in ($125,000) or 
winning ($250,000) the Big 
Ten 
Championship 
Game, 

a $50,000 bonus if he is Big 
Ten Coach of the Year and a 
$150,000 bonus for each year 
the team’s Academic Progress 
Rate is 960 or higher. He can 
also earn $300,000 for playing 
the College Football Playoff 
or $500,000 for winning the 
national championship.

His contract includes a $2 

million signing bonus.

Michigan marks Harbaugh’s 

fourth head coaching job in the 
last 10 years, most recently in 
San Francisco, where his base 
salary is roughly the same as 
it will be with the Wolverines.

“I kind of think of myself as 

a construction guy,” Harbaugh 
said. “You build this home, and 
hopefully it’s a great cathedral, 
and then afterwards they tell 
you, ‘Go build another one.’ 
And I feel like that again. … 
But I’d really like to live in one 
permanently. And that’s what 
I’m really hopeful for here.”

Harbaugh 
insisted 
his 

decision to take the Michigan 
job had little to do with 
his 
salary 
or 
financial 

considerations.

“I really made a decision 

from 
the 
heart, 
which 
I 

thought was best for myself 
and my family,” Harbaugh 
said. “I’m very excited by it 
and very challenged by it.”

Michigan defeats 

Wisconsin, claims Big Ten 
Tournament championship

By BRENDAN CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer 2017

A little over a month ago, 

Michigan hit rock bottom.

The Wolverines had just lost to 

Big Ten bottom-dweller Ohio State, 
and looked completely shook while 
doing so.

But following the game, senior 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. stood 
in the corner of the Crisler Center 
pressroom looking as poised as ever.

He knew his team had just hit 

its lowest point, but realized things 
could only get better.

“If what we’re going through at 

this point spearheads a run and us 
taking the next step in some places 
we lagged in, then I’m all for it,” 
Walton said following the Ohio State 
loss. “I’m more so excited. I think it’ll 
make it a better story.”

And what a story it has become, 

as the Wolverines have done what 
looked impossible over a month ago 
and improbable just four days ago.

They’ve won a Big Ten 

championship.

There were a lot of questions 

asked of Michigan following that 
Ohio State loss. Could Walton and 
senior wing Zak Irvin put together 
complete performances in the same 
game? Could the Wolverines’ defense 
get out of the basement of almost 
every statistical category of the Big 
Ten? Did Michigan players overall 
have a winning mentality?

“The loss at home to Ohio State 

really opened our eyes,” Walton said 
on Sunday. “I think we played well 
but we just layed down and that was 
the biggest moment for us as a team. 
I knew after that very moment guys 
took it to heart, and really wanted 
to make the key adjustments to be 
successful for the rest of the season. 
We did that, and that’s why I was so 
confident going into the rest of the 
season.”

Over the past four days, the 

Wolverines have turned the 
weaknesses present against the 
Buckeyes into strengths. And 
that all culminated in Michigan’s 
title-winning 71-56 victory over 
Wisconsin.

The most suspect of all those 

questions was Michigan’s defense, 
but after watching today, one 
would never know the struggles 
the Wolverines once faced while 
defending.

Michigan opened the second 

half on an 11-2 run to get out to a 
10-point lead. That stretch included 
a 5:19 Wisconsin scoring drought 
and denying the Badgers from 
getting points from the field for over 
eight minutes. The Wolverines also 
were struggling to find points as 
the second half wore on, but their 
defense helped Michigan maintain a 
comfortable lead over that period.

“Especially in the second half, we 

all came together and connected well 
on all cylinders on the defensive end,” 
said redshirt sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson. “Even when they brought in 
within six, we were able to get crucial 
stops and crucial rebounds. I think 
that’s really what sealed the deal.”

But if there was ever a team built 

to respond to those types of runs, 
it’s the Badgers. Guard Bronson 
Koenig and forward Ethan Happ 
combined to score Wisconsin’s last 

12 points of the half, reducing the 
Wolverines’ lead to only one heading 
into intermission.

Again in the second half, the 

Badgers began chipping away at 
an 11-point Michigan lead slowly 
but with the sort of poise their core 
group of seniors have become known 
for over the past few seasons. The 
Badgers would get within six of 
the Wolverines, but Michigan had 
a response every time they were 
closing in.

Irvin and redshirt junior wing 

Duncan Robinson each hit massive 
three-pointers when Wisconsin 
looked like it had found the slightest 
bit of momentum to get on a run.

“I just feel lucky my teammates 

had that sort of confidence in me,” 
Robinson said. “I hadn’t really gotten 
any clean looks in the game. But to 
get that shot and knock it in was a 
special moment.”

When the Badgers put on a 

full-court press for the final three 
minutes of the game, Wilson found 
junior guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman for a slam that brought 
the fans at the Verizon Center to 
their feet and all but shut the door 
on Wisconsin. Wilson was essential 
in the Wolverines maintaining their 
lead down the stretch, scoring 12 of 
his 17 points in the second half, while 
shutting down a first team all-Big 
Ten player in Happ defensively too.

Walton and Irvin were Michigan’s 

primary drivers on both ends all 
game long. Irvin was efficient scoring 
points early on, mixing up cuts to the 
hoop through the Wisconsin defense 
and his signature mid-range jumper. 
He’s put together one of the most 
consistent runs of his career through 
the conference tournament, and 
finished Sunday with 15 points, seven 
rebounds and five assists.

But no performance could 

compare to what Walton was doing 
single-handedly. The senior earned 
assists on the Wolverines’ first 
two scores of the half, and midway 
through the first, went on a personal 
9-0 run, hitting three shots from 
beyond the arc on three consecutive 
possessions to give Michigan its 
initial 10-point lead.

Most importantly, Walton 

quarterbacked his offense through 
a tough stretch in the second half, 
and put the ball in his teammates’ 
hands. His 22 point, six rebound, 
seven assist outing will go down as 
the final jewel that helped him earn 
the crown of the tournament’s most 
outstanding player.

The Wolverines leave 

Washington as the Big Ten’s highest 
seeded team to win the conference 
tournament, and, most importantly 
to them, will be raising a banner at 
Crisler Center next fall. More than 
anything, they have a trophy with 
their names engraved in Michigan 
basketball lore for what they proved 
over the past five days.

“I wanted them to imagine 

what it would be like for them to 
walk into that beautiful William 
Davidson Player Development 
Center and see that trophy and tell 
people about not the four games, 
the five days, and be able to tell 
them that story,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “Because that’s 
part of their legacy together, all 16 
of those guys.”

After 33 years at the helm, Red 
Berenson announces retirement

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Editor 2017

On April 10, nearly one 

month after finishing his 33rd 
season as head coach of the 
Michigan hockey team, Red 
Berenson announced he would 
be retiring.

“I’ve thought about this for 

a long time and I think this is 
the right time and it’s the right 
thing to do for the Michigan 
hockey program,” Berenson 
said in a press release Monday. 
“My heart will always be at 
Michigan and I look forward 
to the team taking the next 
step and making me proud as a 
former coach.” 

Added athletic director 

Warde Manuel: “Red Berenson 
is a legendary figure at the 
University of Michigan as well 
as in our ice hockey history. 
Throughout his career, Red 
has focused on the academic 
and athletic success of the 
young men who have come 
through our program while 
shaping the sport as we know 
it today. He has developed an 
astounding 73 NHL players 
but, more importantly, he has 
positively impacted hundreds 
of young men. We are forever 
grateful for his contributions 
to the University of Michigan 
and I look forward to 
continuing working with Red 
for years to come.”

Berenson has pondered 

retirement in recent years. 
He said Monday that he 
had received questions on 
the recruiting trail about 
his future and how long 
he planned on coaching. It 
bothered him, he admitted, 
that it was an issue, and 
it played a part in his 

conversation about retirement 
with Warde Manuel last year.

The original plan was 

for Berenson to step down 
following last season. But 
Manuel was still settling down 
into his new job — according 
to Berenson, he hadn’t even 
moved to Ann Arbor yet. The 
new athletic director coaxed 
Berenson into staying, and 
so began the last year of his 
career in Ann Arbor.

And what a career it was: 

to trace its outline with each 
of its stops is to follow the 
history of the sport — and 
even history itself. To put the 
longevity of Berenson’s term 
at Michigan into context, the 
last time the Wolverines took 
the ice without him behind 
the bench was during the Cold 
War, with Ronald Reagan 
serving as president of the 
United States.

Many fine players have filed 

in and out of Ann Arbor over 
the years, doing their part to 
fill the trophy cases and bring 
glory to the program. Yet it 
is Berenson’s name that has 
become synonymous with 
‘Michigan hockey’ — and 
rightfully so.

Berenson himself was once 

the star on ice, playing for the 
Wolverines for three seasons 
between 1959 and 1962. He 
enjoyed an illustrious career in 
the NHL, becoming one of the 
league’s first expansion stars 
as it doubled in size during the 
late 1960s. Once his playing 
career ended, he became a 
coach for the St. Louis Blues 
— the team he had become 
famous playing for — and won 
coach of the year in just his 
second season. In 1984, he 
returned to his alma mater, 

where he would remain for the 
duration of his career.

It took longer for Berenson 

to achieve success in the 
collegiate ranks. Michigan, 
once mighty but since 
humbled, was in dire straits. 
It had been nearly a decade 
since the team experienced its 
last postseason success, and 
the onus was on Berenson to 
rebuild the program. It was no 
easy task. To begin his tenure, 
he endured three consecutive 
losing seasons. He took 
another step forward once 
the team was full of players 
he had recruited, leading the 
team to three straight winning 
seasons — but with zero NCAA 
Tournament appearances.

The final breakthrough 

occurred in Berenson’s seventh 
year. The Wolverines recorded 
over 30 wins for the first time 
in school history and finished 
as an NCAA quarterfinalist, 
marking the beginning of a 
22-year NCAA Tournament 
streak that remains the longest 
streak any team has ever put 
together in college hockey.

During that streak, 

Michigan made the Frozen 
Four 11 times, finishing as 
the runner-up once while 
collecting two national 
championships.

Berenson has left an 

enduring legacy not only with 
his achievements on the ice but 
off of it, as well. A graduate of 
the university’s Ross School 
of Business, Berenson has 
stressed the importance of 
education to all of his teams, 
priding himself on molding 
boys into men. Some of his 
players have even returned to 
the University after the end 
of their playing careers to 

take graduate classes — like 
Berenson once did. In recent 
years, he has sought to raise 
money and awareness for 
the cause of Scott Matzka, 
a former Wolverine who is 
currently fighting ALS.

Michigan will be in 

uncharted territory next 
year. This past year, the 
Wolverines struggled through 
their worst season in three 
decades, missing the NCAA 
Tournament for the third time 
in four years.

They will bring back the 

bulk of the team barring any 
unexpected early departures 
to the NHL, and may even 
have a new head coach with 
ties to the program — such as 
Michigan Tech’s Mel Pearson, 
a longtime assistant, or 
current assistants Billy Powers 
and Brian Wiseman. Berenson, 
in his new role as a special 
advisor to Manuel, will surely 
have a say in who his successor 
is, as well.

“I hope there’s some 

Michigan awareness or 
Michigan connection for a 
coach that will feel the right 
way about what a Michigan 
man should be like or what 
a Michigan team should be 
like,” Berenson said. “We’ve 
got some of those coaches here 
today, and we’ve got some 
great alumni here today. I’m 
sure Warde will make the right 
decision. It might be an easy 
decision, it might not be. We’re 
going to get a lot of people 
interested.”

But regardless of any ties 

the new coach might have 
to the program, things will 
undoubtedly feel different.

It is the end of an era and 

oh, what an era it was.

Michigan can’t overcome early deficit, loses in 
National Championship

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer 2015

OKLAHOMA CITY — After 

falling to No. 1 Florida, 4-1, in 
Game 3 of the Women’s College 
World Series final, the Michigan 
softball team came just shy of a 
national championship.

A 
complete 
performance 

from NFCA Player of the Year 
and 
right-handed 
pitcher 

Lauren 
Haeger 
carried 
the 

Gators to an early lead, and 
they never looked back. Haeger 
dominated on both sides of the 
ball, shutting down the third-
ranked 
Wolverines’ 
offense 

which didn’t register a single 
hit until the fifth inning.

The Gators wasted no time 

on offense. In the bottom of 
the first inning, Haeger flared 
a 1-1 pitch to shallow center 
with runners on first and 

second. One run scored, and 
Florida was off to the races 
with no outs. A pair of batters 
later, Florida’s Taylor Schwarz 
dropped a double into left field, 
making headway for outfielder 
Nicole Dewitt and Haeger, who 
reached home safely, increasing 
their lead to three before the 
first inning came to an end.

“They were the best team 

tonight,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “They’ve been 
No. 1 all through the season. 
They showed up to come after 
us, and that first inning broke our 
back. We gave them a lot of free 
bases, too many, and you can’t do 
that to a team like Florida.”

Florida’s leadoff hitter Kelsey 

Stewart came up to bat for the 
second time in just the second 
inning and blasted a double to 
left that scored outfielder Justine 
McLean from second base. The 

Gators’ fourth run of the day 
prompted Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins to take senior left-
handed pitcher Haylie Wagner 
out of the circle for sophomore 
right-hander Megan Betsa.

Betsa solved the immediate 

puzzle and struck out two 
straight batters to strand three 
Gators on base.

Freshman first baseman Tera 

Blanco recorded the Wolverines’ 
first hit of the night, ripping a 
full-count pitch to left field in the 
top of the fifth inning. Sophomore 
shot stop Abby Ramirez followed 
up with a single of her own, and 
the top half of the order would 
come up.

With two outs and two on for 

junior second baseman Sierra 
Romero, if there was a time for 
the team’s superstar to step up, 
this was it. Romero sent the first 
pitch to left field and Blanco, 

from second base, was able to 
score. The Gators got out of the 
fifth inning, but Michigan had 
finally gotten on board.

Freshman 
pinch-hitter 

Amanda Vargas stepped to the 
plate in the sixth inning and 
produced, lining to center for a 
base hit. Next, Wagner, now the 
designated player, was hit in the 
shoulder. Another two-on, two-
outs situation for Michigan’s 
offense, and this time it was 
Blanco’s turn.

But yet again, the Gators got 

out alive when Blanco grounded 
out to the short stop. Overall, 
the Wolverines could not handle 
Haeger in the circle Wednesday 
night. 
She 
was 
named 
the 

tournament’s Most Outstanding 
Player.

“(Lauren Haeger) was great 

tonight,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“A 

very deserving champion. She 
definitely took care of business.”

Against Betsa, the Gators 

couldn’t get a single run, as 
the Big Ten Pitcher of the Year 
handed Florida eight strikeouts. 
However, she hit a multitude of 
batters to load the bags and was 
taken out in the bottom of the 
sixth when Wagner returned to 
the circle.

In the final inning, Ramirez 

got onto first base as Florida’s 
short stop couldn’t handle her 
slapper in time. Michigan’s next 
batter, junior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence, struck out looking, 
and Romero returned to the 
plate. Romero grounded to the 
shortstop, who tossed to second 
for the next out, and sophomore 
outfielder 
Kelly 
Christner 

stepped into the box, Michigan’s 
last chance.

But 
after 
three 
pitches, 

Christner grounded out to first, 
and the season was over. The 
Florida Gators were the 2015 
National Champions.

“I told my team today, and 

I told my team (Tuesday), 
‘Tonight doesn’t define our 
season,’ ” Hutchins said. “We 
would’ve liked to walk out of 
here with the other trophy, but 
this has been a great team. I’m 
really proud of them.”
