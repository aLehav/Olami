ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Sexual misconduct 
regulation expansion 
could prompt more 

Title IX cases

By CAMY METWALLY and 

RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporters

Amid 
other 
impacts 
of 
a 

planned new policy on student 
sexual misconduct, University of 
Michigan administrators said they 
are expecting the changes will 
prompt the number of Title IX 
cases to increase.

Title IX investigations are cases 

filed against the University for 
possible violations of federal law 
regarding the handling of sexual 
misconduct. Up until this July, they 
will be governed by regulations 
laid out in the Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy. After that, the 
University will adopt the University 
of Michigan Policy and Procedures 
on Student Sexual and Gender-
based Misconduct and Other Forms 
of Interpersonal Violence.

The new policy, announced last 

Tuesday, makes several changes, 
including expanding to include 
gender-based 
harassment 
— 

violence suffered due to gender 
identity, sexuality or orientation 
— and intimate partner violence. 
It also modifies the definition of 
consent and the scope of prohibited 
conduct, as well as restructuring 
the 
sanctioning 
and 
appeals 

process.

Anthony 
Walesby, 
the 

University’s Title IX coordinator, 
wrote in an e-mail interview that 
the Office of Institutional Equity — 
the office responsible for processing 
sexual misconduct complaints — 
largely anticipates the rise in cases 
because of the inclusion of gender-
based harassment and intimate 
partner violence.

The revisions come after the 

release of OIE’s annual sexual 
misconduct report in January, 
which showed that though the 
number of reports increased by 
33 percent from 2014 to 2015, the 
number of cases investigated by 
OIE stayed the same. According to 
the report, 29 of the 172 cases OIE 

Contrasts between 
local and federal law 
draw mix of student 

reactions

Hash Bash — an annual April 

event when pot enthusiasts from 
Ann Arbor and beyond gather to 
smoke marijuana and meander 

around campus — will be on the 
University of Michigan’s Diag 
Saturday afternoon. Nationally 
recognized 
since 
1972, 
Hash 

Bash is meant as a rally for the 
decriminalization of marijuana 
and a more lenient drug policy 
nationwide.

Marijuana legalization, long a 

controversial topic nationwide, 
has gained steam in recent years 
as multiple states have chosen to 
allow the drug either entirely, or 
for medicinal purposes.

Over the past few decades, 

studies have shown it has the 
potential 
to 
have 
powerful 

medicinal effects on conditions 
such as severe or chronic pain and 
cancer. Advocates for the drug 
also argue that overall prohibition 
has been ineffective, and doesn’t 
make sense when compared to 
how alcohol is regulated.

Allen St. Pierre, executive 

director 
of 
the 
National 

Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws, an organization 
that argues for reform of marijuana 
laws, noted that the majority of the 

American public is currently in 
support of legalization.

“The Gallup polling of today 

indicates 
58 
percent 
of 
the 

population supports legalization,” 
St. Pierre said. “When NORML 
was founded in 1970, it was 10 
percent.”

According to the University 

Health 
System, 
however, 

marijuana is not recommended 
by 
some 
medical 
experts 

due to the fact it is not yet 
approved by the Food and Drug

Study says potential 
spill could impact 
720 miles of Great 

Lakes shoreline

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter 

A break in the Enbridge Line 5 

pipeline — a 63-year-old pipeline 
that runs beneath the Straits of 
Mackinac and carries up to 23 
million gallons of light crude oil 
and natural gas per day — could 
potentially spill into 720 miles of 
Great Lakes shoreline, according 
to a University of Michigan 
study released Thursday.

Researchers created a model 

to demonstrate 840 possible 
simulations of an oil spill by 
the pipeline and outlines of 
where the oil could go. Based 
on the model, up to 720 miles 
of coastline could be affected 
by a spill and require extensive 
cleanup.

David Schwab, a research 

scientist for the University’s 
Graham Sustainability Institute 
and designer of the simulation, 
said due to the strong, rapidly 
changing currents in the Great 
Lakes, it would be difficult 
to predict how and where 
the oil would be distributed 
to. However, Schwab noted 
the spread would be vast and 
disastrous.

“This is possibly the worst 

place in the Great Lakes in 
terms of how fast and how far 
something would spread,” he 
said. “If there were a spill it 

would be really hard to predict 
where that oil would end up.”

Schwab’s 
research 
in 

Thursday’s 
study 
goes 
into 

detail about the movement of 
the oil and the extent to which 
shorelines could be damaged. 
Based on the model, nearly 60 
percent of Lake Huron’s open 
water and more than 15 percent 
of Lake Michigan’s open water 
could have visible oil in the event 
of a spill.

The effects an oil spill would 

have on surrounding ecosystems 
were beyond the scope of the 
study, but Schwab said in a 
press release prior to this study 
that the potential effects of an 
oil spill in the area were largely 
unknown, this model shows the 
extent of the possible impact.

“Until now, no one knew 

exactly how much shoreline was 
vulnerable to spills in the Straits 
of Mackinac,” he said in the 
release. “These findings show 
that under the right conditions, 
a spill in the Straits of Mackinac 
could affect a significant amount 
of shoreline and open-water 
areas in either Lake Michigan 
or Lake Huron, or both, very 
quickly.”

Enbridge Line 5 and the 

danger of a potential spill has 
been a matter of concern for 
the public over the past years, 
including on campus. Earlier this 
month, the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats hosted a 
discussion on water issues in 
the state, which highlighted the 
pipeline as a threat.

Discussion aims 
to draw attention 
to barriers facing 

community

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Thursday night at the Ford 

School of Public Policy, four 
panelists 
discussed 
various 

obstacles 
the 
transgender 

community 
face, 
especially 

concerning health care, at the 
Trans Health Access Panel.

Approximately 0.3 percent of 

the U.S. population is estimated to 

be transgender — about 700,000 
adults — according to a study 
from the University of California, 
Los Angeles. Transgender is an 
umbrella term for individuals 
whose gender identity and/or 
gender expression differs from 
the sex they were assigned at 
birth.

Laura 
Jadwin-Cakmak, 

the 
panel’s 
moderator 
and 

Health Behavior and Health 
Education 
research 
director, 

said 
transgender 
community 

members face unique health 
care issues for several reasons, 
including discrimination when 
their gender identity does not fit 
in the binary male-female system.

Panelist 
Leslie 
Nicholas, 

a 
naturopathic 
medicine 

practitioner, noted how deeply 
ingrained the binary system is in 
people’s minds, saying it does not 
include those who do not identify 
themselves as simply male or 
female.

“When someone has a baby, 

we first ask them if it’s a boy or a 
girl,” Nicholas said. “Why not ask 
for the baby’s name? Why not ask 
how the baby is doing?”

Several panelists emphasized 

that several countries — including 
Germany, New Zealand and 
Australia — recognize that there 
are more than just two genders.

Event aims to 
highlight need 
for continued 

advocacy

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

A panel in the Wolverine 

Room of the Michigan Union 
Thursday night discussd the 
rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, 
highlighting political and social 
changes over time and the 
continued need for advocacy to 
fight against discrimination.

The panel, hosted by the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
consisted of Jim Toy, founder 
of the Spectrum Center and 
Jim Toy Community Center; 
Kelly 
Maxwell, 
academic 

co-director and lecturer of 
Intergroup 
Relations; 
Rose 

Maxwell, 
systems 
engineer 

at the Ford Motor Company; 
and Jason Morgan, director of 
government and community 
relations 
at 
Washtenaw 

Community College.

Business 
junior 
Paul 

Guilfoyle, 
chair 
of 
the 

Stonewall Committee within 
College Democrats, said the 
event’s purpose was to support 
the LGBTQ+ community and 
identify the issues they face.

“A lot of people think that 

after the same-sex marriage 
ban was overturned the LGBTQ 
community’s work was done,” 
he said. “We feel it’s really 
important to address the other 
issues still remaining that the 
community faces at this time.”

The panel discussed how 

pushes for civil rights within 
the community were sparked 
following 
the 
Stonewall 

Riots, a series of spontaneous 
demonstrations 
in 
New 

York City in June 1969, and 
culminated in the Supreme 
Court decision to legalize same-
sex marriage in June 2015.

Kelly said she has seen a 

massive difference in rights 
even during her lifetime.

“From the 1990s to the 

present, it is a huge cultural 
shift,” she said.

State, 
city 
and 
campus 

policies on preventing LGBTQ 
discrimination 
are 
mixed. 

Under current Michigan law, 
the Elliott Larsen Act prohibits 
discrimination 
based 
on 
a 

variety of factors including sex, 
race and religion in the state of 
Michigan but does not account 
for sexual orientation or gender 
expression. In December 1972, 
Ann Arbor stepped beyond 
state law and amended its 
anti-discrimination ordinance 
to 
include 
protections 
for 

sexual orientation, which Toy 
co-authored. The provision was 
further expanded in October 
2014 to include provisions for 
gender expression and identity, 
survivors of domestic violence, 
political 
beliefs, 
genetic 

information, arrest record and 
familial status.

At 
the 
University, 
the 

Board 
of 
Regents 
adopted 

an 
amendment 
including 

protection on the basis of 
gender identity and gender 
expression in the University’s 
bylaws’ 
non-discrimination 

clause in September 2007.

During 
the 
panel, 
Toy 

recounted his attendance at the 
Board of Regents meeting when 
they voted on the amendment,

Jason Morgan, director of government and community Relations at Washtenaw Community College, speaks about 
his experiences being openly gay in the workplace at an event sponsored by the University of Michigan’s chapter of 
College Democrats in the Michigan Union Thursday.

See LGBTQ, Page 3

received in 2015 were investigated, 
66 were referred to the Review 
Panel and 78 did not fall within the 
scope of the policy.

Walesby 
wrote 
that 
the 

broadened scope of the new policy 
aims to create an environment 
in 
which 
more 
students 
feel 

comfortable 
to 
report 
such 

experiences.

“With the additional definitions 

of prohibited conduct in the policy, 
our hope is that students will come 
forward to express concerns,” he 
wrote.

In a February meeting with 

the Daily, E. Royster Harper, the 
University’s 
vice 
president 
for 

student life, expressed concern 
about potential discourse that 
stigmatizes and dismisses sexual 
misconduct, 
as 
evidenced 
by 

campus climate surveys showing 
that many students may not 
report sexual assault. She said she 
thought education, training and 
transparency are key to combating 
such unawareness.

In a 2015 campus climate 

survey, only 6.3 percent of students 

considered 
themselves 
“very 

likely” to report an incident of 
sexual assault to OIE, while 12.8 
percent reported themselves to be 
“somewhat likely” to do so. The 
survey found 22.5 percent of female 
students have experienced sexual 
assault during their time at the 
University.

“That’s what I saw in the 

survey, a kind of normalizing of 
inappropriate behavior, and we 
have to interrupt that,” Harper said. 
“I think we reshape our thinking 
about the issue.”

LSA 
senior 
Laura 
Meyer, 

volunteer co-coordinator for the 
Networking, Publicity and Activism 
Program at SAPAC, said she thought 
the revision was a natural addition 
to the current policy.

“I think it’s important to have it 

in the policy because a lot of violence 
based on gender or on perceived 
gender or perceived sexual identity 
or sexuality, occurs at the same 
time or concurrently with sexual 
misconduct or sexual violence,” 
Meyer said. “And so I think it’s 
really important to have it together.”

However, she noted that she 

had several concerns about how 
changes in the new policy could 
impact reporting. She pointed in 

particular to a “Sexual History 
of the Parties” clause, which 
allows prior sexual history to be 
considered when there was a “prior 
or ongoing relationship between 
the Claimant and Respondent” or 
“to establish a pattern or practice 
of conduct similar in nature by the 
respondent,” as concerning.

According to the clause, the sexual 

history will never be considered 
evidence, but could be used in certain 
limited number of cases to assess the 
nature of communication between 
both the claimant and respondent, 
according to the policy, and establish 
intent or motive.

Meyer said she thought that 

kind of clause is the product of an 
even larger, underlying issue — how 
consent is defined — noting that 
she would like to see a definition 
of consent that relies on “verbal, 
enthusiastic, 
affirmative, 
sober, 

coercion-free consent” instead of 
one that also requires trying to 
understand body language as well.

“My concern with that is that the 

whole concept of using that sexual 
history is based on what I think is 
a very weak definition of consent,” 
she said.

The updated policy modifies the 

enforced definition of consent to 
clarify instances of incapacitation 
and coercion, and also aims to 
increase 
awareness 
and 
thus 

reporting on campus through 
changing how another issue, 
stalking, is treated. While it was 
also prohibited in the previous 
policy, it will now be listed as a 
separate category.

Walesby wrote that OIE has 

reviewed several instances of 
stalking that related to Title IX 
since the 2011 interim policy, with 
the Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution 
addressing 
other 

cases that did not violate federal 
guidelines. He wrote that by 
addressing stalking as a distinct 
category, OIE hopes to highlight 
the issue.

“It’s meant to help educate 

our campus and remind our 
community 
that 
stalking 
is 

prohibited by university policy,” he 
wrote.

In an interview with the Daily 

last week, University President 
Mark Schlissel said he hopes 
to engage the entire campus in 
creating reform around the issue.

“Our overarching goal is to 

make campus as safe as possible.”

College 
Democrats, 
said 
the 

state government needs to take 
the potential danger of the

catastrophic outcome of a spill.

“Because of its location in 

the Straits of Mackinac, the 
potential damage from a spill 
there is unimaginable,” he said. 
“As Democrats, we believe the 
Great Lakes must be protected 
as some of the greatest natural 
resources our state and our nation 
possesses. 
The 
environmental 

and 
economic 
consequences 

of a break in Line 5 cannot be 
taken lightly, especially given the 
current administration’s revealed 
inability to properly respond to 
water crises.”

Protesters 
also 
gathered 

outside of last year’s Mackinac 
Policy 
Conference 
to 
raise 

awareness for the issue, hoping 
to influence policy makers to 
further regulate or shut down the 
pipeline.

Mariah 
Urueta, 
Michigan 

organizer for Food & Water 
Watch — one of the groups that 
organized the protest at the 
conference— said she hopes to see 
the pipeline shut down because of 
its threat to the Great Lakes.

“Pipeline 
5 
should 
be 

permanently 
decommissioned,” 

she said. “We do not believe that 
any oil at all should be flowing 
through the Great Lakes. It poses 
unnecessary risks to our Great 
Lakes.”

According 
to 
Urueta, 
the 

majority of the oil flowing through 
the pipeline is not consumed by 
Michigan residents, and is instead 
transported through to Canada. 
The group also has concerns 
regarding Enbridge’s ability to 
react to a breakage in the pipeline, 
claiming it could take anywhere 
from a few hours to a few days for 
the proper response team to be 
organized.

Activists 
also 
note 
that 

Enbridge 
Energy 
does 
not 

have the best track record for 
maintaining pipelines. In July 
2010, a different pipeline owned 
by Enbridge experienced a large-
scale spill affecting 35 square 
miles of the Kalamazoo River — 
the largest inland oil spill in U.S. 
history. In 2013, the National 
Wildlife 
Federationrevealed 

Enbridge was not following the 
safety guidelines they agreed 
to when a diver discovered 
Enbridge Line 5 was lacking many 
necessary supports.

Ryan Duffy, supervisor of 

regional 
communications 
and 

media relations for Enbridge, said 
the company constantly monitors 
the pipeline and would be able to 
shut off the pipeline within three 
minutes of a detected breakage.

Additionally, Duffy said the 

pipeline was built to the highest 
standards and does not anticipate 
any issues moving forward. He 
said Enbridge has emergency 
protocols, 
like 
emergency 

response 
drills 
and 
sending 

devices inside to look for testing 
in case an accident does happen.

“Our most important concern 

is safety; that’s why we do 
constant testing on the pipe,” he 
said. “But there is just no reason 
to make any changes. The pipe is 
in excellent condition.”

Despite these assurances by 

Enbridge, along with protesters, 
members of the legislature have 
pushed for further action on the 
issue. Last October, Jeff Irwin 
(D–Ann 
Arbor) 
submitted 
a 

resolution 
calling 
upon 
Gov. 

Rick Snyder (R) and Michigan 
Attorney General Bill Schuette to 
exercise their right to terminate 
the state’s contract with Enbridge 
and shut down the pipeline.

Last week, Schuette submitted 

a request, along with other 
members 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Pipeline Safety Advisory Board 
for Enbridge, to release more 
data 
concerning 
Pipeline 
5’s 

integrity and inspection policies. 
According to a press release, the 
current read-only form of the data 
severely limits the usefulness 
of 
the 
provided 
documents, 

preventing the state from properly 
analyzing risk.

Under 
the 
initial 
1953 

agreement between Lakehead 
Pipeline 
Company 
— 

laterpurchased by Enbridge — 
and the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality and 
Natural Resources, there is a 
termination clause allowing the 
state to revoke its agreement 
under 
certain 
conditions, 

including if the pipeline is not 
operated under the best practices.

The resolution provides several 

reasons why the termination 
clause should be invoked, such 
as high water pressure on the 
pipeline and its age.

Irwin said though Enbridge 

Line 5 may not fail, the potential 
harm it could cause is too great to 
risk.

“The likelihood of the problem 

is probably relatively small,” he 
said. “But the magnitude of the 
harm would be tremendous. 
The concern if there is a mistake 
— like there was in Kalamazoo 
— the magnitude of the harm 
is enormous and the ability of 
Enbridge to fix it is not there.”

Schwab said he hopes the new 

research will impact future policy 
on the state level to address the 
pipeline.

“We hope this information will 

inform spill-response planning 
and will help government officials 
make sound decisions about the 
oil pipeline beneath the straits,” 
he said.

Administration, and has the ability 
to 
impair 
memory, 
judgment 

and coordination. Opponents of 
the drug argue that the medical 
impacts of it aren’t yet clear, and 
could be significantly negative.

In Michigan, medical marijuana 

is legal, but recreational use is 
not, despite legislative pushes to 
legalize it fully. Furthermore, on 
campus, University policies follow 
federal 
law, 
meaning 
neither 

medical nor recreational use is 
legal — a situation that each year, 
Hash Bash places in sharp relief.

Balancing the purpose of 

Hash Bash

Despite 
likely 
marijuana 

consumption at the event, last 
year’s Hash Bash only resulted 
in three arrests. This year’s 45th 
annual Hash Bash will take place 
on April 2, and, as usual, will be 
directly on campus.

The University’s Alcohol and 

Drug Policy states that possession 
of 
marijuana 
on 
University 

property 
is 
a 
misdemeanor, 

punishable by a fine of up to $2,000 
and possible imprisonment of up to 
one year.

University Police spokeswoman 

Diane Brown said the department’s 
policy is that the event itself is 
not 
something 
UMPD 
would 

take action against, but drug 
consumption is.

“It’s not legal to be smoking or 

possessing marijuana on the Diag 
at this event,” Brown said. “It’s 
exercising of free speech, but at 
the same time, the University and 
the police and DPSS don’t condone 
the use of illegal drugs or the public 
consumption of alcohol on our 
campus.”

Brown said in recent years, 

attendees at Hash Bash have made 
speeches and rallied for about an 
hour, and then continued their 
activities off campus. Once the 
attendees leave campus, any illegal 
activities are under the city’s 
jurisdiction. Currently, marijuana 
is decriminalized in Ann Arbor, 
resulting in only a civil infraction 
and a $30 fine.

“Most of the time, the crowds at 

this are reasonably well-behaved — 
it’s just trying to manage and make 
sure people who look like they’re 
having considerable difficulty from 
a medical situation are provided 
medical treatment,” Brown said.

LSA junior Erin Dunne, who is 

director of Students for Sensible 
Drug Policy and on the organizing 
committee for Hash Bash, said the 
event is crucial for demonstrating 
political activism on campus.

“It’s important for this to 

happen on campus because it’s an 
opportunity for students to both 
be exposed to political opinions 
and viewpoints and hear from a 
lot of speakers from the political 
activist network, but also the 
national activist network,” Dunne 
said “It’s also an opportunity for 
the community to see that students 
care about these issues.”

Dunne said the event organizers 

do not advocate illegal behavior 
at Hash Bash and notify both 
the University and the city of 
Ann Arbor that the event will 
happen. Police then patrol at their 

discretion.

She emphasized that despite 

the potential for people to engage 
in activities that might violate 
University policies, the University 
should allow for student-led events 
that exercise student speech. 

“Hash 
Bash 
is 
considered 

student 
speech,” 
Dunne 
said. 

“It’s allowed to happen because 
of the First Amendment. It is 
meant to be a political rally and 
not a marijuana party on the Diag, 
although there are some people 
who misunderstand the purpose of 
the event.”

State policies surrounding 

marijuana usage:

Marijuana — whether used for 

medical or recreational purposes 
— is currently legal in 23 states and 
the District of Columbia, according 
to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures.

However, each state varies in 

what amount and type of marijuana 
is legalized. In Michigan, Proposal 
1 dictates recreational marijuana 
as illegal, though it allows for legal 
possession of 2.5 usable ounces 
if used medically. So far, there 
are nearly 100,000 patients in 
the state registered for the use of 
medical marijuana, according to 
the Michigan Medical Marijuana 
Program.

Last September, State Rep. Jeff 

Irwin (D–Ann Arbor) proposed 
legislation aiming to legalize and 
tax the private use of marijuana for 
Michigan residents 21 years and 
older.

“Prohibition is not working. It’s 

expensive. It ruins people’s lives, 
and it distorts the priorities of our 
law enforcement agencies,” Irwin 
said in a recent interview with The 
Michigan Daily.

His bill, House Bill 4877, would 

make the possession, use and 
purchase of marijuana legal for 
adults 21 and older, decriminalizing 
the use and possession of the 
substance and providing a system 
for licensing sellers, much like 
alcohol regulations. It’s modeled 
after 
similar 
legislation 
in 

Colorado, where recreational use 
is legal.

“If we learned one thing from 

Colorado, it’s that their system of 
legalized marijuana is working,” 
Irwin said.

The bill has drawn opposition 

from Republican members in the 
legislature, and a range of groups 
in the state.

On campus, LSA freshman 

John Sack, freshman chair for 
College Republicans, said he does 
not support the legalization of 
marijuana for recreational use. He 
cited several studies regarding the 
use of marijuana in Colorado that 
have pointed to issues with people 
driving under the influence of 
marijuana, which could jeopardize 
safety on the road.

“I think there’s a lot of drawbacks 

to legalizing marijuana,” Sack said. 
“While I fully agree with legalizing 
it medicinally, I think recreational 
use poses a lot more risks to every 
person and to society as a whole.”

According 
to 
the 
National 

Institute of Health the known 
effects 
of 
marijuana 
include 

breathing 
problems, 
increased 

heart rate, poorer physical and 
mental health and lower life 
satisfaction. 

Irwin said he does not see his bill 

getting passed, given conservative 
control of both chambers in the 
state legislature, he has also 
invested time into theMILegalize 
campaign, a petition drive to try to 
legalize cannabis.

Under Michigan law, a petition 

drive can place a legislative change 
on the ballot if a group garners 
enough signatures.

“People on both sides of the 

political spectrum are realizing 
that prohibition isn’t working,” 
Irwin said. “It’s been a huge, huge 
failure and it’s incredibly costly. 
People are realizing that marijuana 
is a more benign substance than 
even things like alcohol, which are 
legal and available.”.

St. 
Pierre 
echoed 
Irwin’s 

statements, also saying there is little 
merit to arguments suggesting that 
marijuana use will rise following 
legalization.

“One out of three youth between 

the ages of 15 and 24 use marijuana 
regularly,” St. Pierre said. “If one 
just takes the fearful argument 
that there will be an increase 
in marijuana use, consequently 
there will probably be a decrease 
in alcohol use and binge drinking. 
There will probably be a decrease 
in tobacco and opioid use.”

Sack, 
however, 
disagreed, 

pointing in particular to issues 
he said educational institutions 
could face following a nationwide 
legalization of marijuana.

“If you look at Holland and 

Portugal, where they legalized 
(recreational use of marijuana), 
and actually Amsterdam, their 
mayor actually had to go back 
and ban students from smoking 
marijuana,” Sack said. “Because 
they would go into class stoned, 
grades would drop, productivity 
would drop.”

St. Pierre also noted that 

legalizing marijuana could lead 
to changes in the justice system, 
pointing to the fact that young Black 
males are five times more likely to 
be charged with a marijuana crime 
than young white males.

“The data doesn’t lie that the 

arrests, prosecutions and worse, 
incarcerations, that have to do 
with marijuana are totally racially 
disparate,” St. Pierre said.

Enforcement on campus
Even as state and national groups 

push for recreational legalization, 
policies on the University’s campus 
remain completely restrictive — no 
medicinal or recreational use, and 
a misdemeanor charge, not a civil 
infraction, if caught using it.

Brown 
said 
because 
the 

University receives federal funding 
as a public university, federal law 
takes precedence over state law on 
campus.

“In 
order 
to 
have 
legal 

possession of marijuana you have 
to have a valid medical marijuana 
card and there are a number of 
restrictions you have to adhere to,” 
she said.

One 
particular 
area 
this 

becomes 
quickly 
clear 
in 
is 

University 
Housing. 
Because 

University 
Housing 
policies 

restrict all illegal substances, 
students who use marijuana for 
medical issues are not allowed to 
use marijuana on campus.

Sack said while he doesn’t 

support full legalization, watching 

a family member struggle to 
manage their health issues due to 
restrictions on medical marijuana 
at the University led him to support 
medical legalization, echoing a 
position other students on campus 
also expressed.

In response to these kinds 

of concerns, Brown said she 
recognized the policy makes it 
difficult for those with a medical 
issue to manage their condition, 
even with a legitimate medical 
marijuana card, but nonetheless 
reiterated University policy.

However, 
several 
students 

said they felt that regardless of 
actual policy, enforcement of 
University policies surrounding 
both marijuana and alcohol is not 
consistent.

An LSA junior, who requested 

to remain anonymous because 
of admitting to illegal activity, 
recalled getting away with openly 
smoking and drinking in her 
residence halls.

“My freshman year I lived in 

Bursley, and there’s nothing else to 
do in Bursley except smoke weed,” 
the student said. “I know a lot of 
people who smoke for (a medical) 
reason, but they don’t have a card, 
because they don’t need one here.”

She said her freshman year, she 

acquired marijuana most often 
through a mutual friend whose 
family grew marijuana.

Despite 
smoking 
fairly 

frequently, she said she has never 
gotten 
caught 
for 
possessing 

marijuana, and does not know any 
other students who have gotten 
caught.

“So many people smoke at this 

campus,” she said. “Every party 
you can find shit and get it. Every 
party that I go to, someone is 
smoking weed on the back porch. 
It’s everywhere. Where do people 
get it? How? I don’t know. It’s just 
there.”

The future of the legalization of 

marijuana

Ultimately St. Pierre said he 

believes there are multiple reasons 
marijuana prohibition has been 
kept in place by lawmakers for 
so long, such as law enforcement 
opposition and long-term advocacy 
efforts against it

“(These organizations) waste 

billions of dollars a year trying to 
enforce a prohibition the public 
no longer wants,” St. Pierre said. 
“If government really, genuinely 
would like to achieve its stated 
goal of reducing the amount of 
marijuana used — notably amongst 
young people — to make it illegal 
and propagandize against it the 
way they have hasn’t achieved any 
of its stated goals.”

Regardless of the long-term 

prospects 
for 
legalization, 

however, one thing is clear — 
this Saturday in Ann Arbor, at 
least one side of the arguments 
and 
controversy 
surrounding 

marijuana will be on full display, 
as it has been for the past 44 first 
Sundays in April.

That display, organizers said, 

will hopefully at the least spark 
some discussion about campus and 
state policy if nothing else.

“Hash Bash is fundamentally a 

rally to change laws,” Dunne said. 
“And get the conversation started 
about 
legalization 
and 
harm 

reduction.”

affect the quality of life for trans 
individuals, citing that 41 percent 
of trans individuals have reported 
to have attempted suicide, much 
higher than 4.6 percent of the 
overall population.

Panelist Kathryn Fessler, a 

pediatrician and sociologist, said 
during 20 years of working with 
more than 100 young transgender 
individuals, 
she 
has 
worked 

with only one person who did 
not suffer from depression or 
anxiety. However, she added that 
this does not mean mental health 
disorders and transgender people 
are linked.

“There’s this idea that all trans 

people need mental health care,” 
Fessler said. “That’s not true. The 
reason why trans people need 
mental health care is because they 
are living in horrible conditions.”

The panelists also discussed 

how difficult it is for transgender 
individuals to find transgender-
inclusive 
and 
transgender-

affirmative 
medical 
providers 

and 
how 
uncomfortable 
the 

experience can be at the doctor’s 
office.

“We get asked questions about 

our bodies all the time in health 
care settings, even when it’s 
unrelated to the reason why we 
are there,” said Elliot Popoff, a 

project manager at the SexLab. 

Along with discussing the 

issues, panelists also touched on 
potential solutions. Panelist Bré 
Anne Campbell, a community 
specialist at the University’s 
Center for Sexuality & Health 
Disparities, 
emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 
hiring 
more 

transgender 
individuals. 
A 

2011 national survey showed 
that 26 percent of transgender 
individuals lost a job due to 
discrimination and 50 percent 
were harassed on the job.

Nicholas 
said 
the 
non-

transgender community must be 
welcoming and treat transgender 
individuals as human beings. 
She added that mistakes are OK 
as long as people have the best 
intentions and try to understand.

“It’s not rocket science to treat 

each other as human beings,” 
Nicholas said. “Best intentions 
are well received by people who 
know you are trying. We’ve got to 
be welcoming.”

Public Health student Jack 

Andrzejewski, who attended the 
event, said the topics discussed 
during the event aligned with his 
research interests at the SexLab, 
which include sexuality and 
gender identity.

“(The event) spoke to our 

personal interests in terms of our 
research and the work that we 
have been doing,” Andrzejewski 
said.

saying he worked on the issue 
for over 20 years.

“We 
advocated 
for 
two 

decades 
to 
add 
sexual 

orientation to our University’s 
non-discrimination bylaws,” he 
said. “One day, I got a call from 
a friend who said ‘Get your butt 
over to the Regents’ meeting. 
They’re going to vote up this 
amendment.’ So over I went, and 
they voted it up.”

Morgan, 
who 
is 
running 

for Washtenaw County city 
commissioner, 
discussed 

his 
experiences 
in 
politics, 

noting that running for office 
as an openly gay man may be 
problematic in other areas, but 
not in Ann Arbor.

On the national level, few 

politicians are openly gay. Only 
seven members of Congress 
are openly gay or bisexual, 
despite 3.4 percent of the U.S. 
adult 
population 
identifying 

themselves 
as 
lesbian, 
gay, 

bisexual 
or 
transgender 

according to Gallup Poll. 

“My mom, when she found 

out, sat me down and said, ‘You 
are never going to be able to 
work in politics if you’re gay,’ ” 

he said. “She genuinely meant 
it as a worry for me, but there’s 
nothing I can do about being 
gay — I’m not going to hide it. 
I’m certain that no one in Ann 
Arbor that’s going to vote for me 
anyway is not going to because 
I’m gay.”

The panelists also each made 

recommendations for how to 
advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, 
highlighting the importance of 
interacting with state legislators 
and speaking openly about the 
issues facing the community.

Maxwell 
said 
openly 

participating in the discussion 
and making people more aware 
of the issue can have a large 
impact.

“Be active, be vocal and be 

out there so they can see us,” she 
said. “We were invisible for so 
long, and it’s amazing what just 
showing your face does.”

LSA freshman Kellie Lounds, 

who attended the event, said she 
thought it was key in informing 
the population on issues facing 
the LGBTQ+ community.

“I feel like it’s really important 

to educate yourself to be aware 
of how you can actively help 
other people,” she said. “This is 
a really great opportunity to do 
so because it was a very candid 
discussion.”

M

y childhood was spent 
exploring the world with 
wide-eyed wonder. I was 

constantly being 
told I could do 
and be anything 
I 
wanted. 
I’m 

lucky and very 
privileged 
in 

that respect. I 
have a supportive 
family who has 
trusted 
every 

decision 
I’ve 

made 
in 
my 

academic career 
and hasn’t pushed me toward one 
area of study or another. They raised 
me to do what I want and value my 
happiness above all else. If I wanted 
to drop out of school tomorrow and 
just work for the rest of my life, my 
dad would stand behind that decision 
if it was what was going to make me 
happy. Not that I ever would, but 
the fact that the option is even there 
means my happiness is valued in my 
family above all else.

Then I arrived here and our 

bustling school was full to the 
brim with opportunity. Here, I 
really can do anything. But the 
conversations 
behind 
whether 

taking the opportunities that truly 
make us happy are shrouded in 
the constant wondering of how 
these decisions affect the incomes 
of our futures. Choosing classes 
at orientation swiftly moved from 
fun to anxiety-ridden. I remember 
scouring the course guide and 
fleetingly wondering if there were 
still spots in orgo despite the fact I 
had absolutely no interest in any area 
of study related to the sciences. I 
ended up signing up for Introduction 
to Buddhism. But I couldn’t help but 

be plagued with the question asking 
whether or not I had done something 
wrong by signing up for classes that 
were far from sensible in the grand 
scheme of my degree. I thought 
it was a mistake to take such an 
obscure class that I would definitely 
enjoy 
over 
something 
deemed 

useful on the road to a successful 
future. I wish I could say it was 
with that decision that I resolved to 
covet my happiness above all else. 
Unfortunately, I struggled with 
similar anxieties for a while.

Society still tells you to be 

whatever you want. Except major 
in English. Also Women’s Studies is 
useless unless you want to go into 
even crazier debt for graduate school 
to make your degree worth anything. 
Right now, I’m a double major in 
International and Women’s Studies. I 
came in wanting to do humanitarian 
work and travel, which brought 
me to International Studies. To be 
quite honest, I accidentally became 
a Women’s Studies major. One day, 
I realized I was more than halfway 
done with the degree requirements 
and 
suddenly 
I 
was 
declared. 

I’ve since realized I want to take 
an entirely different career path 
than the humanitarian work I had 
originally planned, yet, I’m still an 
International Studies major. I think 
I’ve kept it for the cushion it gives 
me when explaining my studies to 
people. Out of both of my majors, at 
least one is reasonable, right?

Still, I keep hearing how much 

money I’m not going to make and 
how little my degree will be worth. 
Whatever happened to just doing 
what we want? When did a higher 
education become worth it only 
if you were studying something 
“practical”? For some people, job 

security and wealth will make them 
happy. For people like me who enjoy 
studying the “impractical” things, 
money is the last thing in mind.

My peers’ strong opinions on what 

I should study threw me into an 
anxiety-ridden existential crisis. At 
one point last year, I found myself on 
the University of Michigan’s Program 
in Neuroscience website, trying to 
make myself interested enough to 
sign up for some classes. Instead I 
applied to minor in writing. I was 
accepted into the program and I’ve 
since realized I want to be a writer. 
Writing doesn’t even break the list 
of 20 lowest-paying college majors 
to avoid. But why does this list even 
exist? I’ve been getting more and 
more fed up lately with the complete 
lack of appreciation for education 
we all have. Nothing has been about 
learning for a long time. In high 
school, everything was for the grade. 
Now, it’s for the degree and what kind 
of job you can get. It’s fine if you value 
money and a job title. I don’t. 

Now 
I’m 
going 
to 
sound 

pretentious here for a minute, but 
I really do not care about money. I 
just want to be happy. My inevitably 
lower income doesn’t mean I won’t 
be. It’s almost worse to be told it’s 
useless to try to do something simply 
because I won’t make money. I don’t 
have to make six figures a year to be 
happy. The truth of the matter is, 
my degree is probably going to be 
useless. I am not going to get a job 
with a women’s studies degree. But, 
that doesn’t discredit the work I’m 
putting into getting this degree. I’m

T

he first time I had a seizure 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 

terrifying 
and 
confusing 

events of my life. Everything that 
happened was a fog. One moment, I 
was volunteering as a referee for the 
local youth football league, and the 
next, I was staring up at a group of 
paramedics and my parents, who I 
knew had not been present during 
the football game itself. From that 
moment on, I underwent multiple 
tests from different doctors, and they 
all gave me the same diagnosis. I had 
epilepsy, but they weren’t sure what 
things might trigger it. I was given a 
prescription, and I went on my way, 
pretty much living my life as usual. 

Unfortunately, this wasn’t my 

first exposure to epileptic seizures. 
My mother also has epilepsy, but her 
case is much more potent than mine. 
She can’t attend fireworks shows, 
her seizures can be triggered by 
flash photography and even sunlight 
shining through trees while driving 
on a highway can be dangerous for 
her. Though my triggers are not 
always the same as my mother’s, I am 
always conscious of flashing lights. 

Most of these things are easily 

avoidable. Stimuli like fireworks and 
flash photography are possible to 
avert for the most part. I also make 
sure to get a reasonable amount of 
sleep every night, because it may be 
dangerous for people with epilepsy 
to be low on sleep. But one thing that 
is all together unavoidable — that 
can, at any time, spur on an epileptic 
seizure — is police lights.

Police cars in the state of 

Michigan are each equipped with 
one solitary red “gumball” light on 
the top of the car. While this sounds 
tame compared to most police cars, 
each light contains 12 light heads, 
with nine LED bulbs in each head. 
This equates to 108 lights on each 
car. When these lights are used by 
police officers, they are blinding, and 
for somebody with epilepsy, they can 
be a nightmare.

Of course, I realize police must 

use their lights when pulling people 
over or chasing down criminals, 
but there are occasions when police 
lights are used inappropriately.

My parents recently visited me 

at the University of Michigan for a 
basketball game. As we walked out 
of Crisler Center after the game, we 
were shepherded toward our car 
by police who had stopped traffic. 
To do this, the police parked their 
cars sideways in the intersection 
and turned on their flashers. This 
forced my mother and me to look 

downward at the ground and shield 
our eyes, while my father walked in 
front of us, leading the way. We were 
extremely fortunate that my father 
was there at the time.

Think for a moment about what 

would have happened if he hadn’t 
been there. My mother would’ve 
almost definitely had a seizure 
while crossing that intersection. 
I would’ve tried to help her, but I 
might have been rendered useless by 
the flashing lights, too. Bystanders 
would’ve attempted to help, but 
because of a lack of public knowledge 
about epilepsy, they might not have 
known exactly how to help. It may 
have been just as effective to put 
out barriers indicating the road 
was closed. Instead, the police cars 
parked in the intersection created 
an obstacle for those of us who 
have epilepsy to enjoy what was an 
otherwise great night. 

Though epilepsy isn’t something 

that is widely understood in our 
society, this doesn’t mean it isn’t 
prevalent. One in 26 people will 
develop epilepsy at some time in their 
life. And these seizures aren’t simply 
an inconvenience or an annoyance. 
Many people with epilepsy aren’t 
like me. Not everyone can recover as 
quickly after a seizure.

In some cases, people can cause 

substantial harm to themselves while 
having a seizure, such as hitting their 
heads on the ground and giving 
themselves concussions. During one 
of my own seizures, I fell facedown 
and awoke with blood staining my 
clothes and the ground below me. 
Seizures may also cause extreme 
physical fatigue. When regaining 
consciousness after a seizure, people 
often feel as though they have just 
finished running a race.

People can run into an enormous 

number of places with unexpected 
flashing lights in day-to-day life. 
That is why the police force should 
be pioneering a movement to reduce 
the times they utilize flashing lights. 
They should be the ones setting 
the example. This is particularly 
important with epilepsy, because it 
isn’t at the forefront of the public’s 
mind. People don’t consider who 
might have epilepsy around them 
before they take a picture with 
flash in a dark restaurant. People 
don’t stop and think who might be 
coming to a party before they turn 
on strobe lights. 

Of course, flashing police lights 

were obviously implemented in the 
first place for a reason. According 
to blogger writer Bogdan Popa at 

autoevolution.com, law enforcement 
vehicles used to only have a single 
light beacon on their cars “to attract 
everyone’s attention and let them 
know that an official vehicle is 
approaching,” according to Bogdan 
Popa. But eventually, these alerting 
lights evolved into the bright, 
flashing lights of today, coupled with 
blaring sirens.

I am not asking for anything 

enormous. I don’t think it would 
be too much to ask to simply turn 
off the flashing lights when police 
direct traffic. I don’t think it would 
be too much to ask for the lights 
on a police car to not flash at all. If 
the lights themselves get people’s 
attention and indicate an official 
vehicle, then it stands to reason 
they could do without flashing 
entirely. Bright lights and sirens 
alone would appropriately identify 
an active police car. Changing this 
small detail would not only help 
people with epilepsy in interactions 
with police cars, but those without 
epilepsy would notice the change as 
well. They would wonder why these 
changes were made and hopefully 
begin to engage in an important 
conversation on epilepsy awareness.

I realize it isn’t possible for 

flashing lights not to exist in all of 
society. I realize people have a right 
to take flash photography, watch 
fireworks and use strobe lights. But 
at the same time, there has to be 
some sort of concession made for 
those of us who have epilepsy. Of all 
people, it seems like police officers 
should be the ones to draw that line. 
Those with epilepsy should not be 
relegated to their homes, unable to 
attend large events for fear police 
cars might flash their lights outside 
of the event.

I implore you, the Michigan State 

Police, to consider this out-of-sight 
minority. I ask you to consider who 
might be attending those concerts 
and sporting events where you 
direct traffic, and I want you to 
consider making the lights on your 
cruisers less potentially triggering. I 
believe the changes you could make 
would be small and would not affect 
your officers’ ability to do their 
jobs. But at the same time, these 
could be instrumental changes 
toward a wider consideration of 
epilepsy. At the very least, it would 
be something my family and I would 
greatly appreciate.

Hopefully heard,

Dear Michigan State Police

H

ome.

If you look the meaning up in 

the dictionary or online, it says that 

home is a permanent residence. To me, home 
is a physical place, yes, but it is also defined 
by how I feel when I am there. In my opinion, 
home is where one can go to feel relaxed and 
comfortable — comfortable enough to feel 
uncomfortable — and welcomed. When I came 
to Ann Arbor in 2013, I thought that I had found 
my hoMe. I have met, and continue to meet, 
some of the best people I have ever known, and 
they make me feel comfortable. I have found 
this one spot by the river in the Arb that never 
fails to make me feel relaxed after a stressful 
day. I have been able to critically think while 
at this university and push myself outside of 
my boundaries because I have felt comfortable 
enough to feel uncomfortable.

However, I have never felt fully welcomed. 

As a Muslim student on this campus, I have 
known that my hoMe is not perfect, but I have 
to remind myself that no home is and perfection 
is not what I am striving for. What I want is to 
make this campus a more welcoming place for 
Muslim students. As a part of these efforts, 
my peers, staff and I hosted an event this 
past January titled “Student Voices Against 
Islamophobia.” People of all identities on 
campus were invited to hear Muslim students’ 
experiences at the University of Michigan. 
After their stories were heard, there was 
a session on allyhood intended to increase 
solidarity between Muslim and non-Muslim 
students, faculty and staff.

Tonight, a few members from our group, 

including myself, were attending an event where 
we were awarded for our successful Cross 
Cultural Programming. Ironically, as the award 
was being announced, my peers and I were 
notified of messages on the Diag. Among them 
were messages that stated “#STOPISLAM.” In 
that moment, I felt that no matter how much 
I try to move forward and create a welcoming 
environment on campus, Islamophobia is 

right there pushing me back. It feels like I am 
constantly hesitant to call this campus hoMe.

I fear that if people constantly see Islam as 

a threat, then they will begin to believe this 
message that Islam is something to fear and 
Muslims are people to hate. So for the next 
hour, my peers and I wiped the Diag clean of 
these hateful messages, and I scrubbed as hard 
as I could. As I watched the letters fade, I began 
to think that if I just scrubbed fast enough, 
fewer people might see, and therefore believe, 
this message. In the back of my mind, though, 
I could not help but think of how degrading 
it was to be cleaning up these messages that 
were left by someone else in my supposed 
hoMe. I kept bouncing back and forth between 
being unsurprised and utterly shocked. While 
I knew that this was the dominant narrative 
surrounding Muslims on the news, I could 
not believe (but sadly I kind of could) that this 
narrative would exist at this University.

However, I refuse to let days like these hijack 

my religion and take my hoMe away from me.

So to whoever wrote that message on the 

Diag, it is NOT Islam that you have to worry 
about stopping. In fact, you should consider 
the hatred that you yourself are spreading by 
supporting that message.

But above all, I want you to know that my 

religion is not the reason that hatred exists in 
this world.

“Indeed, Allah does not wrong the people 

at all, but it is the people who are wronging 
themselves” Quran (10:44). 

In fact, my religion is the reason that I know 

how to respond to animosity with love.

“Good and evil can never be equal. Repel (evil) 

with that which is better, and see how, then, 
someone between whom and you was enmity 
shall become a true friend” Quran (41: 34).

W

hat would a course look like if 
students were able to choose how 
they earned their grades? Gameful 

learning, one of the biggest 
revolutions in pedagogy, 
seeks 
to 
address 
just 

that. At the University of 
Michigan, gameful learning 
comes in the form of 
GradeCraft, the brainchild 
of Barry Fishman, Arthur 
F. Thurnau professor of 
Learning Technologies in 
the School of Information 
and School of Education. 
The project is currently 
sponsored by the Digital Innovation Greenhouse. 
Since its conception, more than 2,000 students 
have enrolled in at least one of the 29 GradeCraft 
courses the University offers, and that number 
will only continue to grow.

What sets a GradeCraft course apart from 

most other courses is that most — if not all — 
assignments are optional, and students build 
their grades in the class from the bottom up, 
instead of starting with 100 percent and losing 
points along the way. GradeCraft is structured 
like a video game wherein students earn points 
by completing assignments, allowing them to 
“level up” one-third of a grade level once they 
reach specific point benchmarks.

Such a system intends to give students 

flexibility in a course, allowing them to capitalize 
on their strengths, to pursue assignments they 
find most interesting and to take risks without 
fear of destroying their grade. (After all, 
students can earn points, but they technically 
cannot have points taken away.) The end result 
is a course custom-made for each student, one 
where students leave feeling they have learned a 
lot and are proud of the work they’ve done.

This semester, I had the opportunity to take 

my first GradeCraft course, Honors 232: Deep 
Time: The Science of Origins. I was excited 
and curious about the freedom of choice the 
platform would provide in my studies. And 
with the semester nearing its close, I can safely 
say that while I like the philosophy behind 
GradeCraft, I believe it fell short of fulfilling 
such purpose in practice.

There are plenty of things I like about 

GradeCraft. Perhaps the thing I like about it most 
is that it gives me a lot of flexibility in my schedule, 
allowing me to plan my schedule for this course 
around exams and papers due in other courses 
and over material I’m most interested in. It also 
opens up plenty of opportunities for instructors 
to create unconventional assignments. In Deep 
Time, for example, I could earn points for 
attending talks and events related to course 
topics, which — especially as a first-year student 
— provided many fantastic opportunities to 

make the most of what Ann Arbor has to offer. 

But, as I mentioned before, gameful learning 

is not without its faults. One of the side effects 
of having a course structured like a video 
game is the inevitable “tutorial” that lasts an 
indefinite period of time at the beginning of 
the course. For 10 to 15 minutes each lecture 
and discussion period for the first few weeks 
of class, we’d discuss the logistics of the course: 
how to navigate the platform, where to turn 
assignments in, which assignments are open 
indefinitely and which ones have strict due 
dates. As a result, students lose quite a bit of time 
that could have been used to engage more deeply 
with the subject matter.

Coming into a class with a nontraditional 

platform, however, I expected this learning 
curve. From my experience, gameful learning’s 
tragic flaw lies in the defining feature of its design 
— its gameability. Whereas the platform seeks to 
foster deep, meaningful work, it isn’t hard for a 
student in a GradeCraft-based course to scrape 
up enough points to earn the grade they want in 
the course by merely doing surface-level work. 
In fact, I have found that gameful learning more 
or less encourages students to take the easy way 
out and do the minimal amount of work possible 
to earn the grade they want in the course.

Unfortunately, I feel these factors were 

present in my Deep Time course. As I look around 
the lecture hall, I notice very few students even 
take notes on the material covered in lecture. 
Students can easily skip assigned readings, 
but then be rewarded for showing up to the 
discussion section, unprepared for conversation. 
This cutting-corners mentality adversely affects 
the learning not only of the individual student, 
but of the class as a whole: Without a concerted 
effort around a common goal from all students in 
a gameful course, the richness of learning in that 
class quickly deteriorates.

This creates a gaping, pedagogical flaw in 

gameful courses: There is no guarantee that 
students learn new skills or even live up to the 
course expectations within the framework of 
a GradeCraft-based course without limiting 
the freedoms the platform brings to the table. 
Without a compulsory obligation like an exam or 
paper looming around the corner, there seems to 
be no incentive or for students (beyond genuine 
interest in the subject matter) to actually learn 
all of the material.

While I definitely can say I still learned 

quite a bit in this course, both GradeCraft and 
instructors’ and students’ interactions with 
the platform are most definitely still in beta. 
The platform has promise, but unfortunately 
students will have to miss out on some valuable 
learning in the process.

‘Boy & the World’ is 
attractive but flawed

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

“Boy & the World,” an ani-

mated Brazilian film directed by 
Alê Abreu (“Garoto Cósmico”) 
and 
nomi-

nated 
for 

the Academy 
Award 
for 

Best 
Ani-

mated 
Fea-

ture, 
never 

lets you go. 
It’s one of 
those 
films 

with 
pac-

ing so perfect, it’s impossible 
to look away. For an essentially 
silent film (the only lines of dia-
logue are few and far between, 
plus they’re reversed recorded 
Portuguese), 
that 
pacing 
is 

critical to keeping the story pro-
gressing.

In “Boy & the World,” we fol-

low an unnamed protagonist, 
a young stick figure boy from 
the countryside whose father, 
pressured to work harder, one 
day boards a train to head for 
the capital. The boy immedi-
ately becomes distressed, see-
ing visions of his father, who 
then fades away, leaving the 
boy alone. In his rural home, 
the animation is simple, bare 
and childlike. Small doodles in 
wildly varying colors comprise 
the grass, houses and clothes. 
There, a five-tone folk melody 
plays consistently, a recurring 
musical cue for the untouched 
naturalism of his home and 
the melancholic memory of his 
father — a well-remembered 

and vacant part of his life.

Our protagonist summons 

the will to search for his father. 
Traveling far from his home, 
across the rural landscape, the 
boy traces his father’s path to 
the grand metropolis. Along the 
way, he gains a few companions 
who provide him with hous-
ing. In the city, the boy walks 
through the vice district, among 
rush hour traffic and over-
whelming layers of advertising. 
Houses are stacked upon each 
other to form impractical, men-
acing towers.

In 
this 
futuristic 
world, 

where cities float in glass cap-
sules in the sky and flying sail-
boats are a safe and practical 
method of transportation, any-
thing seems possible. But, alas, 
it comes with a cost. This we 
can determine by the anima-
tion. In the cities, everything 
is processed, fake. Abreu uses 
magazine cutouts for objects 
instead of drawing them, like in 
the countryside. Even the news 
anchors and models have hair, 
lips, eyes cut out from maga-
zines.

While the film’s visual effer-

vescence is quite attractive, the 
story suffers from its format. 
Dialogue-free, 
hand-drawn 

films are dangerous; many of 
the characters look the same, 
and without dialogue as a ref-
erence for characters, a num-
ber 
of 
scenes 
immediately 

become confusing, especially 
when Abreu uses flashback and 
visions to convey ideas. Is this 
our protagonist as an older man 
or is this his friend? Minor ques-

tions like this bogs down the 
film.

Beyond 
its 
obvious 
com-

ing of age message, “Boy & the 
World” is primarily an environ-
mental parable. Environmental 
destruction is far from subtle; 
Abreu would prefer to animate 
in broad strokes than leave 
interpretation up to the viewer. 
One particular scene, a truly 
jarring and surprising sequence 
of environmental destruction, 
clearly demonstrates his inten-
tion. But that’s no hurdle for the 
film. This is a serious problem, 
especially for Abreu, a Brazilian 
who is undoubtedly wary of his 
nation’s destruction of the Ama-
zon.

Abreu wears his influences on 

his animated shoulders. Chan-
neling the fast-paced, music-
focused animated shorts of Walt 
Disney, the stunning large-scale 
choreography of Busby Berke-
ley, and the dystopian met-
ropolitan cityscapes of Fritz 
Lang, Abreu clearly has a wide 
appreciation for 1930s film. And 
it couldn’t be more relevant. 
For a story so deeply concerned 
about capitalist environmental 
destruction, Abreu turns to the 
1930s, a decade in which art-
ists had to confront economic 
turmoil 
through 
their 
art. 

“Boy & the World” is as much 
a pointed criticism of today’s 
environmental woes as Chap-
lin’s “Modern Times” was of the 
Depression. And, like Chaplin 
before him, Abreu keeps you on 
your toes, right until the very 
end. It doesn’t hurt that there’s 
a pretty view, too.

EVENT PREVIEW
A historic ‘Sleeping 
Beauty’ production

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

For the 25th anniversary of 

the University Musical Soci-
ety’s lauded dance series, some-
thing special 
was in order. 
Fortunately 
for 
them, 

and for local 
audiences, 
the 
perfect 

opportunity 
presented 
itself 
when 

American 
Ballet Theatre 
announced 
it would be 
going on tour 
with 
Tchai-

kovsky’s “Sleeping Beauty.”

There could hardly be a bet-

ter time for the performance. 
American 
Ballet 
Theatre 

appeared in the headlines last 
year when they appointed the 
legendary Misty Copeland as 
a principal ballerina, the first 
Black woman to ever win that 
position in the United States. 
The audiences on Friday and 
Saturday will even get the 
opportunity to see Copeland 

dance in a minor role.

And during the end of March, 

many on campus are craving 
an escape from the drudgery 
of work and studies. “Sleeping 
Beauty” promises to be one of 
the most lavish productions 
the area has seen in recent 
years, featuring an exquisite 
set, period costumes and an 
enormous number of perform-
ers. Bringing a huge, luxurious 
production here was far from 
easy, as Jim Leija, UMS’s direc-
tor of education and community 
engagement, can attest.

“It’s also a really big col-

laboration between UMS and 
the Michigan Opera Theatre in 
Detroit,” Leija said. “We don’t 
really have a stage or venue 
that’s big enough to do this kind 
of classical production in Ann 
Arbor.”

The collaboration, which will 

continue in future productions, 
worked out beautifully for both 
partners, resulting in stellar 
production values that stay true 
to the show’s original produc-
tion in New York City.

“It’s a really beautiful pro-

duction. It’s quite lavish,” Leija 
said. “There are something like 
200 people in the performance, 

and about half of them are from 
the local community.”

In the weeks leading up to 

the production, American Bal-
let Theater has participated 
in 
community 
workshops 

and other engagement events 
with UMS. Dancers led mas-
ter classes at the University of 
Michigan as well as at Wayne 
State University and Oakland 
University, and Detroit high 
schoolers even had the oppor-
tunity to “meet the artists,” 
Leija said. They also visited the 
Ann Arbor YMCA to lead a “You 
Can Dance” collaboration with 
adults of all ages interested in 
movement, dance and expres-
sion.

The 
dazzling 
show 
runs 

through Sunday, the culmina-
tion of years of planning and 
months 
of 
preparation 
for 

UMS, Michigan Opera Theatre 
and American Ballet Theatre. 
Then the ballet will hit the 
road, bringing their fantasy of 
slumbering royals and magi-
cal kisses across the country. 
But the promising partnership 
between UMS and Michigan 
Opera Theatre, beginning with 
this impressive high note, will 
continue in the coming years.

ALBUM REVIEW
Domo Genesis goes 
beyond Odd Future

By ANAY KATYAL

Daily Arts Writer

During Odd Future’s peak, 

critics of the collective liked to 
parrot the notion that the group 
was 
nothing 

but a loosely 
tied 
collec-

tion of crass, 
offensive, teen-
age hooligans. 
They 
skate-

boarded, their 
music 
pushed 

the limits of 
what was defined as “explicit” 
and their live shows were often 
likened to the bombastic and 
reckless punk concerts of the 
genre’s 
heyday. 
Oftentimes, 

these critics had considerable 
fuel for their argument, espe-
cially when dissecting some 
of the solo projects from OF’s 
frontman Tyler, The Creator, 
or Earl Sweatshirt’s breakout 
single “EARL.” It’s an argument 
the general public generally 
accepted if they had not been 
exposed to much of the group’s 
work beforehand, but for those 
who actually took the deep dive 
into the crew’s music without 
having the conservative predis-
positions of a suburban soccer 
mom, the group’s diversity of tal-
ent and the mischaracterization 
of those beliefs becomes fairly 
clear. Frank Ocean became the 
neo-soul enigma the music-lov-
ing public has become infatuat-
ed with. Matt Martians and Syd 
Tha Kyd started successfully 
making smooth and sensual soul 
arrangements under the moni-
ker “The Internet.” Earl Sweat-
shirt, with his dark, brooding, 
sonically 
distinct 
bodies 
of 

work, can be accurately likened 
to a younger MF Doom. With 
Genesis, Domo Genesis joins the 
ranks of OF alumni that illus-
trate the overlooked level of tal-
ent that permeated the group 
during its height.

When profiling each mem-

ber of Odd Future, Domo Gen-
esis is often touted as being “the 
most underrated” or “the most 
slept on.” Often times, people 
who said that wanted someone 
to validate their pretentious 
love for his debut mixtape Roll-
ing Papers, but there was some 
truth to the idea. No one dared 
call Domo the best of the group; 
after all, he isn’t as technically 
gifted as Earl, nor is he the kind 
of bombastic character that 
Tyler is. Despite that, he quietly 
pushed out three mixtapes, each 
increasing in skill and mastery, 
slowly exchanging the teenage 
immaturity Domo was suscep-
tible to for more technically 
astute, complex lyrics and beats.

Having been in the works 

since early 2013, Genesis’s elu-
sive release almost became as 
similarly storied as the video 
game “Duke Nukem Forev-
er” and its 15 year protracted 
release date. In those three 
years, Odd Future has essen-
tially disbanded, leaving Domo 
without the free hype he was 
afforded earlier. As disappoint-
ing as it is, Domo still manages 
to drop one of Odd Future’s 
strongest solo projects. Smooth, 
jazzy production and consis-
tently clever lyricism had me 
rewinding plenty of Genesis’s 
songs (namely “Wanderer” and 
“My Own”). Domo used to be a 
rapper who crafted fairly gener-
ic bars about weed and life, but 
Genesis shows a rapper with an 
impressive level of self-aware-
ness and maturity. As much as 
he can talk about getting fucked 
up with his squad, Domo can 
also lament life regrets, and rap 
about the motivators behind his 
musical career.

Genesis’s focal point, “One 

Below,” opens with an emotion-
al spiel from Domo’s mother, 
before he raps about feeling lost 
as a teenager, and how music 
helped him find fulfillment. 

Throughout the album, his lyr-
ics often deal with the influence 
music has had on his develop-
ment. Considering that, Genesis 
is an apt name for Domo’s debut 
LP, symbolizing the advent of 
Domo finding purpose, some-
thing he largely owes to his 
musical career.

Though Genesis is a testa-

ment to how much Domo has 
grown as a rapper, collaborators 
on the project also play a signifi-
cant part in making the album 
the enjoyable listening experi-
ence that it is. “Go (Gas),” an 
eclectic combination of Juicy J, 
Wiz Khalifa and Tyler, The Cre-
ator, contains an entertaining 
level of goofiness and liveliness. 
On “Coming Back,” Mac Miller’s 
sing-songy hook is integral in 
maintaining the song’s intended 
vibe. Anderson .Paak’s smooth, 
hybrid R&B and rap perfor-
mance on “Dapper” will have 
anyone dancing in their seat.

Genesis 
has 
the 
makings 

of being an overlooked work, 
largely thanks to Odd Future’s 
general nonexistence and the 
maligned reputation some of its 
members are unfairly slapped 
with. But considering that Gene-
sis is one of hip hop’s most cohe-
sive bodies of work so far this 
year, it might deservedly lend 
fame and credibility to Domo 
once and for all. Domo’s career 
timeline has been a long-winded 
journey toward Domo finding 
his musical identity, and with 
Genesis he finally does that.

Narayanan talks 
progressive retail

At Ross’s “India 
Marching Ahead” 
conference, Myntra 

CEO stands out

By ANAY KATYAL

Daily Arts Writer

Last 
weekend, 
the 
Ross 

School of Business hosted the 
seventh iteration of the India 
Business 
Conference, 
with 

the theme of “India March-
ing Ahead.” A variety of Indian 
business leaders and former 
bureaucrats sat down to talk 
about strides being made in 
the realm of business in India, 
and how the business relation-
ship between the United States 
and India has been changing 
for the better. Among the list 
of panelists, which included 
esteemed guests such as Yum! 
Brands India President Niren 
Chaudhary and former Minister 
of Finance for India Yashwant 
Sinha, Myntra CEO Ananth 
Narayanan and his talk about 
changing waves in the Indian 
retail industry through his 
retail app stood out.

Narayanan has a colorful his-

tory within Indian enterprise. 
Previously serving on McKin-
sey & Company’s product devel-
opment and automotive practice 
teams in South Asia, Naray-
anan’s background isn’t imme-
diately indicative of someone 
with fashion expertise. But he 
emphasized that heading Myn-
tra requires more than rudi-
mentary style knowledge.

“[Myntra] 
works 
hard 
in 

understanding the quirks of the 
Indian consumer base,” Naray-
anan said during his talk.

And this is important con-

sidering the rapidly develop-
ing economy India has right 
now. Myntra’s parent company, 
Flipkart, has only recently ush-
ered in the advent of online, 
Amazon-style shopping in the 
country. According to Price-
waterhouseCoopers, 
India’s 

e-commerce 
market 
itself 

has grown around $9 billion 
between 2009 and 2013. In 
2014, Amazon made an effort 
to cash in on this trend with a 
$2 billion investment in their 
Indian business. The industry 
for online purchases in India is 
much like the Wild West in its 
open landscape; with Myntra, 
Narayanan is among some of the 
individuals trying to capitalize 
on the opportunity, creating a 
new generation of fashion-con-
scious Indians in the process.

Myntra was acquired by Indi-

an e-commerce giant Flipkart 
(Amazon’s biggest competitor in 
the region) in early 2014. While 
Flipkart mainly functions as a 
“one stop shop” online desti-
nation for Indian consumers, 
Myntra was a strategic buy for 
Flipkart in their efforts to target 
India’s new, trendy and finan-
cially empowered youth popu-
lation. Flush with Flipkart’s 
cash and boasting an impressive 
inventory of the latest in fash-
ion and athletic wear, Myntra 
utilizes a variety of mobile and 
online channels to reach their 
targeted demographics, often-
times pushing an app-centric 
shopping experience in a coun-
try whose mobile phone adop-
tion has grown to over 1 billion 
subscribers according to Forbes.

Not only has Myntra been 

engaging Indian consumers in 
innovative ways, but they’re 

also among a select few Indian 
companies 
engaging 
India’s 

millennial populace on issues 
relating to gender and identity 
in Indian society. Their recent 
“All About You” advertising 
campaign employs Bollywood 
superstar Deepika Padukone to 
challenge longstanding myths 
about the kind of colors and 
clothes Indian women should 
wear; in a joint campaign with 
Indian fashion label Anouk, 
Myntra broadcasts a commer-
cial depicting a lesbian couple 
and 
their 
anxieties 
around 

meeting each other’s conser-
vative Indian parents for the 
first time. Evidently, Myntra is 
a remarkably progressive com-
pany in a country that has been 
blighted with issues of misogy-
ny and homophobia, marking a 
change in India’s social direc-
tion from the country’s youth, 
and companies like Myntra 
helping to empower them.

Time will tell if India’s con-

sumers will bite when it comes 
to Myntra’s advances, but the 
company is making laudable 
strides in increasing fashion 
accessibility to Indians. By giv-
ing young Indians a platform to 
both more easily express them-
selves through their styles, and 
affirm their beliefs and values, 
Myntra is a refreshing addi-
tion to India’s corporate land-
scape. With India on track to 
be the world’s youngest country 
by 2020 (according to the New 
York Times), Myntra’s efforts 
in targeting India’s emerging 
millennial middle class and the 
newfound disposable incomes 
they possess are paving way for 
an 
empowered, 
independent 

and socially conscious Indian 
populace. 

One of hip hop’s 
most cohesive 
works so far 

this year

‘U’ students start a 
new local music fest

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

In the not too distant past, 

it was sometimes maddeningly 
difficult to gain access to art of 
interest to you. 
If you wanted 
to hear a piece 
of music, you 
had to go to the 
record 
store 

and hope they 
had it. If you 
wanted to read 
a 
somewhat 

obscure book, 
you had to visit 
your local library and hope it 
was somewhere in their system. 
Visual art could be seen in gal-
leries or in picture books. But in 
the present hyperconnected age, 
when we’re all supersaturated 
with various forms of media, 
entertainment and art via the 
Internet, we can find almost 
anything we want with a few 
clicks and keyboard commands 
(indeed, the challenge today is 
mostly sorting through the vast 
quantity of information to deter-
mine what is worth our time).

While it’s excellent to have 

such easy access to so much, one 
of the regrettable side effects 
of this situation is that we now 
have a tendency to overlook the 
work of local artists, having 
removed the immediacy of being 
local, one of their main advan-
tages. But it’s important to note 
that by so doing we potentially 
lose something extremely valu-
able — a sense of community. 
A sense which is constructed 

through the togetherness of 
people enjoying the art of their 
neighbors. All well-known art-
ists were once local. Without 
the support of those around 
them, the great artists of history 
may have failed to achieve the 
fame they ultimately possessed. 
After all, The Beatles started as 
a group of Liverpool teenagers 
jamming together.

For all of those reasons, it’s 

very exciting that this weekend 
Ann Arbor will have an oppor-
tunity to consume a tremendous 
quantity of local art, gathered 
in a single place as part of the 
Threads All Arts Festival.

“There’s a bunch of things 

happening in Ann Arbor, there’s 
a lot of people who come through 
Ann Arbor, but there’s not a lot 
of people who go to the shows of 
the art that’s happening here,” 
said Nicole Patrick, School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior 
and one of the founders of 
Threads. “So we were kind of 
like ‘Let’s make our own festi-
val, and see what happens.’ It 
was kind of a joke at first, and 
then we wrote a proposal, and 
then it wasn’t a joke — no, mostly 
a dream, not a joke.”

Patrick and her friend, School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Samuel Schaefer, initially 
had the idea to start an arts fes-
tival after attempting to gain 
funding for another project of 
theirs.

“Sam also works on a project 

out of our house — we also live 
together. We turned our attic 
into a recording studio,” Pat-
rick said. “It’s called Stereo Par-
rot, and it’s a recording label … 
they’ve released five to seven 
albums since they started. We 
wanted to get a few dollars for 
that going.”

The pair submitted grant pro-

posals to the EXCEL Program 
for three projects. The program 
provides 
entrepreneurship 

training and career services for 
University students within the 
performing arts.

“We had that idea, kind of 

came up with a grant proposal. 
I took it into my drum teacher, 
Michael Gould,” Patrick said. 
 

“He was like ‘Yeah that’s great, 
but you guys should just like, 
apply for everything you ever 
wanted to do. Don’t just write 
one proposal.’ So we submitted 
three: one for Stereo Parrot, one 
for Threads and one for our band 
Rooms.”

The application to get fund-

ing for Threads was ultimately 
successful, and in the time since 
the proposal, Patrick, Schaefer 
and an additional four friends 
who joined the project have 
worked to bring a diverse array 
of arts and artists to the event 
— from the Balkan brass band 
Rhyta Musik to contemporary 
dancers. This year, Threads will 
have over 50 performing artists 
present, most of which are musi-
cians, with rock bands, original 
classical compositions, jazz and 

more.

“We kind of wanted to touch 

on every genre that we got,” 
Patrick said. “A few electronic 
things too, and DJs as well, that 
are also using projections and 
stuff like that.”

Threads will incorporate far 

more than just music however, 
giving a platform to all sorts of 
artists, such as modern dancers, 
poets, film artists and visual art-
ists. 

This diversity of art genres 

and performances is reflected in 
the name of the festival, Threads 
All Arts, which Patrick said was 
a name long in its conception.

“It came from one of the peo-

ple on the team — Karen Too-
masian, who’s an architect, just 
graduated — she was standing in 
the doorway, with her backpack 
on,” Patrick said. “And — this is 
how she says it — she was looking 
at the rug that was on the floor, 
and she was like, ‘Man, there’s 
a lot of things that make up this 
rug, and that’s cool because it’s a 
pretty rug, and threads, there’s a 
lot of threads on here. Guys we 
should name it threads!’ And it 
was finally the first name that 
everyone didn’t totally hate, so 
we had to keep it.”

The festival will be held on 

Friday April 1 and Saturday 
April 2 at the Yellow Barn, a 
local performance space.

Threads is also partnering 

with UMS to showcase some of 
their local artists in residence, 
who will be performing in the 
festival. 

“(UMS has) helped us a bunch, 

really in term of promotion,” 
Patrick said. “It’s really great.”

Patrick said he hopes that this 

weekend’s festival can be the 
first of many, emphasizing the 
value of local art.

“We really believe that the 

community will feel stronger 
connections to the place that 
they live if they are also aware 
of the artists who live here,” Pat-
rick said. “The cool thing about 
Ann Arbor is that it’s so small 
that it’s like, your cashier is also 
your friend, is also your neigh-
bor, is also this person who’s 
been releasing albums that you 
haven’t known about for 10 
years. And we really want to be 
sort of like a vessel for artists 
trying to establish themselves 
in this town … it’s pretty inspir-
ing, I think, to know that you’re 
walking on the same sidewalk as 
someone who has those feelings 
and expresses themselves in that 
way.”

ASA to celebrate 
African identity

Eighteenth annual 
show fuses music, 
dance, comedy, 

fashion and stories

By MARIA ROBINS-SOMER-

VILLE

Daily Arts Writer

We were. We are. We will be. 

These are the lines that both 
divide and unite the theme 
of this year’s 
Annual 
Afri-

can 
Culture 

show, an annu-
al 
tradition 

created by the 
African 
Stu-

dents Associa-
tion that fuses 
music, dance, 
comedy, fash-
ion and rich 
storytelling 
to explore the 
roots of many 
African 
stu-

dents on cam-
pus.

LSA senior Lukonde Mulen-

ga, president of ASA joined 
the club her freshman year in 
hopes of connecting with other 
African students in a way that 
was unavailable to her in high 
school.

“My parents are from Zam-

bia, and not many Zambians 
immigrate from Zambia,” she 
said. “So where we were living 

the closest people from Zambia 
to us were an hour away.” 

LSA junior Seun Oladipo, 

ASA’s social media chair, said 
he hopes to ensure that the Cul-
ture Show includes a broad and 
diverse representation of Afri-
ca’s 54 countries. 

“We try and get a very 

regional representation,” Ola-
dipo said. “The campus can 
be very much West African-
based, so we try to span dif-
ferent regions within Africa. It 
should be a really educational, 
but really fun experience for 
everyone.”

“I want to leave with ASA 

knowing that they are repre-
senting the entirety of Africa 
and not just one part,” Mulenga 
added.

Historically, the African Cul-

ture Show has been lively and 
well-loved and Oladipo said 
she feels the pressure to exceed 
expectations for this year’s per-
formance.

“I think one of my biggest 

challenges this year is making 
sure that people aren’t compla-
cent,” she said. “We did really 
have a good show last year, and 
I feel like some people came 
into it thinking, ‘oh it’ll be 
amazing,’ not really realizing 
that there is a lot of work that 
goes into making the show.”

About 60 people are involved 

in producing Afrolution this 
year. The group gets support 
from their graduate chapter 
and, has worked to bring in acts 

from outside of the University 
of Michigan community and 
even from outside of the United 
States to perform.

The fashion show, which fea-

tures students exclusively, is a 
mainstay of the African Culture 
show. The group holds open 
auditions for models and com-
bines African-inspired fashions 
with authentic clothing donat-
ed by students and their fami-
lies over the years.

“One place where the theme 

is really apparent is in the fash-
ion show,” Oladipo said. “You 
can see the progression of the 
clothes, how it was pre-colonial 
to how a lot of Africans are 
dressing now to where you see 
the fashion aesthetic going in 
the future.”

She noted that with the show 

in particular, attendees will 
see some differences — though 
they’ll have to wait until the 
show to find out what they are.

“Something that we’ve been 

trying to do differently is the 
way the fashion show is struc-
tured,” Oladipo said. “In pre-
vious years it’d be sectioned 
off by the tempo of the walk, 
so we’d have a slow walk and a 
medium walk and a fast walk, 
and we kind of stuck with that 
for a bunch of years.” 

In combining history, pride, 

music and identity, ASA links 
generations to celebrate what it 
means, has meant and will one 
day mean to be part of a vibrant 
African community.

Michigan set to begin Big Ten play

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

In the eighth inning on Tuesday, 

Bryan Pall was on the mound and 
the Michigan baseball team was 
leading Central 
Michigan, 
9-6. 

Pall 
had 
just 

walked 
the 

bases 
loaded 

and was pitching 
to 
Robert 

Greenman with 
only one out. 

It 
was 
a 

high-pressure 
situation, 
but 

Pall 
kept 
his 

composure and 
forced a crucial 
6-4-3 
double 

play to end the inning and keep 
the game out of reach for the 
Chippewas.

Moments 
like 
these 
have 

become routine for the Wolverines’ 
bullpen early in the season.

The starting rotation, composed 

of 
left-handers 
junior 
Brett 

Adcock, sophomore Oliver Jaskie 
and senior Evan Hill, along with 
right-hander 
sophomore 
Ryan 

Nutof, has been dominant. The 
four have posted a combined 
ERA of 2.39 and started 21 of 22 
contests.

But especially in recent games, 

it has been the bullpen that has led 
the Wolverines to victory. 

Clutch outs late in games from 

pitchers such as freshman William 
Tribucher and junior Mac Lozer 
have helped Michigan (17-5) to 
its best start in 20 years. And not 
only do these key outs hold the 
opponent at bay, they also ignite 
the batting order.

“It is instantly able to energize 

the offense and get the momentum 
back into your dugout,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“Guys are hustling off the field, 
fired up and ready to go hit.

Added junior outfielder Johnny 

Slater: “Fighting at the end of the 
game like that — we get a lot of 
momentum from that.”

After 
dramatic 
endings 
in 

the last two games — a walk-off 
win against Illinois-Chicago on 
Sunday and stranding the bases 
loaded in the eighth on Tuesday 
against Central Michigan — Slater 
thinks the team will carry that 
energy into this weekend, when 
it faces Northwestern (7-18) for a 
three-game set in Evanston. 

Momentum has been on the 

Wolverines’ side lately, as they ride 
a six-game win streak into their 
first conference games of the year.

Maintaining momentum can 

depend on a solid relief staff. And 
Michigan seems to be getting 
better as the season goes. 

Junior 
right-handed 
pitcher 

Jackson Lamb hadn’t pitched in 
almost 12 months due to an injury, 
but he made his season debut last 

weekend. He closed out the ninth 
inning in two of the last three 
games for the Wolverines.

Junior 
left-hander 
Keith 

Lehmann is also coming off an 
offseason injury, and he showed 
that his arm is ready to join an 
already-deep Michigan bullpen. 
Lehmann threw four innings on 
Tuesday and allowed two earned 
runs on three hits.

Lamb 
and 
Lehmann’s 

recoveries aid a staff that is also 
boosted by junior first baseman 
Carmen Benedetti’s ability to help 
the Wolverines on the mound in 
addition to hitting in the 3-hole.

“Whenever (Benedetti) is in 

there, it’s going to be in a situation 
that is an important part of the 
game,” Bakich said.

Benedetti’s 92-plus miles-per-

hour fastball and improved off-
speed pitches have come in handy 
for Michigan. Sunday, he held a 

one-run lead over UIC, pitching 
2.1 innings and striking out four 
without allowing a hit.

The 
Wolverines’ 
schedule 

ramps up starting Friday, with a 
stretch that includes 12 Big Ten 
games over the next three weeks.

The bullpen — comprising 

newcomers 
like 
Tribucher, 

situational pitchers like Benedetti 
as well as now-healthy pieces 
Lamb and Lehmann — will hope 
to continue its successful support 
of the dominant Michigan starting 
pitching. 

As 
the 
Big 
Ten 
favorite, 

Michigan will want to show right 
away that it doesn’t have weak 
spots on the mound, whether it is 
the beginning of the game or the 
ninth inning.

And if they continue to get strong 

showings, the Wolverines have a 
good chance to start conference 
play in dominant fashion.

Wolverines relaxed ahead of regionals

‘M’ hopes to ride 
home advantage

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

Three days before the NCAA 

Regional Championships, one 
would expect to hear all the 
sounds of a grueling practice in 
the women’s gymnastics team’s 
training center, whether it be 
sprints on the runway to the 
vault, the squeak of uneven bars 
or tumbling passes on the floor.

Instead, all that could be 

heard was laughing.

There’s no doubt that the 

laughing came after a grueling 
practice, but it was laughter all 
the same. For No. 7 Michigan, 
this kind of confident, relaxed 
attitude is the engine pushing it 
to do well in competitions. Less 
than two weeks ago, it garnered 
the 
Wolverines 
a 
Big 
Ten 

Championship, and Saturday, 
they’re hoping it’ll get them an 
NCAA Regional Championship.

Watching 
individual 

gymnasts on competition day, 
one wouldn’t notice this attitude. 
Whether it’s Big Ten Freshman 
of the Year Olivia Karas prepping 
for a Yurchenko 1 ½ that got her 
a second-place finish on vault at 
the Big Ten Championships, or 
junior Talia Chiarelli pausing 
before a dismount on beam, each 
athlete is completely focused.

But if you look just behind 

them on the sidelines, you can 
see the rest of Michigan’s team 
smiling and cheering like it’s 
any another meet.

“The coaches are always 

telling us to stop during practice 
because they’ll try to have 
meetings and we’re just being 
loud and funny,” said senior 
Lindsay Williams. “We have 
a lot of fun together, and that 
helps us when we’re competing 
because we’re relaxed. We do 
way better that way.”

Michigan plans on going into 

the regional tournament with 
this same attitude. But facing 
teams like No. 6 Auburn, No. 
18 Stanford, No. 24 Eastern 
Michigan and No. 25 Penn State, 
the Wolverines know they’re 

going to have to focus on more 
than just their confidence to get 
them a finish on top.

“We have been tracking hit 

percentage for landings; that is 
a huge focal point for us,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“The difference between a team 
that goes to the Super Six and 
the team who doesn’t are those 
stuck landings.”

Near the end of the regular 

season, the Wolverines battled 
with some of those landings. At 
the Big Five meet — a qualifier 
for the Big Ten Championships — 
they had struggles with multiple 
landings on beam and on bars.

But at the Big Ten meet, 

Michigan 
looked 
like 
a 

completely 
different 
team. 

There 
were 
stuck 
landings 

all across the board, most 
noticeably by junior Nicole Artz, 
who won two Big Ten individual 
titles on floor and beam.

However, with competition 

coming from No. 6 Auburn this 
time around, the Wolverines 
know that despite their strong 

performance at Big Ten, they 
can’t take that win for granted. 
Michigan 
had 
back-to-back 

regional titles in 2013 and 2014, 
but fell short last year.

And while the Wolverines are 

hoping their confident attitude 
and work on landings will give 
them a chance to claim another 
title, they have a safety net.

“I 
can’t 
emphasize 
the 

importance of the depth in our 
lineup enough,” Plocki said. 
“Having Karas doing the job as 
a freshman, along with Brown 
and Artz — they’re incredible 
all-arounders.

“But you can’t be successful 

as a team with three great 
athletes. I’ve got Chiarelli, who 
is phenomenal on three events 
but goes unrecognized because 
she’s 
not 
an 
all-arounder, 

along 
with 
Sheppard 
and 

Christopherson. At meets like 
these, it can come down to one 
kid, one kid can be our savior. 
Sometimes, that’s the kid who 
doesn’t get recognition.”

Sophomore 
Nichelle 

Christopherson 
is 
a 
prime 

example of this depth. 

Christopherson, 
who 

preformed just four routines 
on uneven bars her freshman 
year, stepped up to the plate 
this year. After senior Briley 
Casanova faced a sidelining 
back 
injury, 
Christopherson 

filled in. She not only filled in 
on the majority of the uneven 
bars rotations where she had 
previous experience competing, 
but also on floor.

Michigan’s roster has just 

11 athletes, and with 24 events 
in a competition, this could be 
a struggle for the Wolverines. 
However, with athletes such 
as Christopherson to fill in any 
gray areas, these low numbers 
don’t prove any problems.

According to the rankings, 

Michigan should be one of the 
two teams advancing to the 
NCAA finals. If the Wolverines 
use their depth along with their 
home advantage, they could 
be restarting their Regional 
Championship streak.

What to watch for: 
‘M’ Spring Game

Fans will get peek 
at QB competition, 

WR depth, new 
D.C. Don Brown

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

Spring 
football 
usually 

comes 
and 
goes 
quietly, 

with its 15 practice sessions 
wrapping up almost as soon 
as fans even knew they began. 
But for the Michigan football 
team, the offseason practices 
were anything but reticent. 
The 
Wolverines 
received 

scrutiny and praise for Spring 
Break travel plans while also 
garnering a captive nationwide 
audience left wondering what 
Jim Harbaugh would do (or 
tweet) in his second year at 
Michigan.

Friday 
night, 
its 
well-

watched spring season will 
come to its close in a fitting 
way: under the lights and in 
front of hoards of curious fans 
in the Big House. 

Here’s what to watch for 

when the Maize takes on the 
Blue in the Wolverines’ Spring 
Game. 

1. Who’s under center?
Jake Rudock was a more-

than-capable signal caller in 
2015, but the fifth-year senior 
transfer from Iowa was only a 
temporary fix at quarterback.

Following 
his 
departure, 

three 
quarterbacks 
have 

separated themselves from the 
pack, but the coaching staff 
says it hasn’t gained enough 
confidence 
in 
any 
player 

to name a starter. Redshirt 
sophomore Wilton Speight and 
redshirt juniors Shane Morris 
and John O’Korn are still 
battling it out, but Friday night 
should provide insight to who 
has the best chance of playing 
on the gridiron on Sept. 3. 

Both O’Korn and Morris sat 

out last season, but Speight did 
see some game action. Against 
Minnesota, the 6-foot-6 player 
came in for an injured Rudock 
and 
led 
a 
game-winning 

touchdown drive, proving he 
can play under pressure.

While 
the 
Spring 
Game 

provides a clear checkpoint 
and will show how the other 
two react to a large audience, 
things will still change over the 
summer months. 

2. O-line chemistry
Of the five offensive linemen 

who 
played 
regularly 
last 

season, four are returning. 
After playing two seasons at 
left tackle, sophomore lineman 
Mason Cole is expected to 
take over at center following 
Graham Glasgow’s graduation.

Cole’s move will leave a spot 

open at the left tackle position, 
which 
sophomore 
Grant 

Newsome will likely assume. 
Newsome, who made his college 
debut against Minnesota in 
2015, contributed as a true 
freshman on the O-line. Now, 
with a season of experience 
under his belt, Newsome is 
expected to perform. Redshirt 
junior Patrick Kugler could 

also play into the mix, if he 
plays well enough at center. If 
so, Cole could be pushed back 
to the outside and Newsome 
would move to the bench.

A lot of team leaders will be 

returning on the line as well, 
including 
three 
fifth-year 

seniors: Kyle Kalis, Ben Braden 
and Erik Magnuson. With as 
much experience as it has, the 
O-line should be a good match 
Friday for a unit that ranked 
fourth 
nationally 
in 
total 

defense last season. 

3. Receivers who aren’t 

named Amara Darboh or 
Jehu Chesson

Last season, Darboh and 

Chesson 
made 
names 
for 

themselves as starting wide 
receivers, but the Wolverines 
could have benefitted from 
more depth at the position. 

Michigan 
passing 
game 

coordinator Jedd Fisch listed 
Moe Ways as a receiver who was 
making strides in the offseason, 
but the sophomore recently 
injured his foot and had surgery 
on Tuesday. He’s expected to be 
back in time for the start of the 
season, but he will miss critical 
practice time throughout the 
summer that will lead to more 
opportunities for others. 

Michigan natives Grant Perry 

and Drake Harris could step up, 
but the sophomore and redshirt 
sophmore, 
respectively, 
will 

need to prove they can play 
under pressure. The Spring 
Game will be another good test 
for that. 

Early-enrollee 
freshman 

Ahmir Mitchell has turned 
heads 
throughout 
spring 

practice and received more 
than a few reps at the spring 
practice held at Ford Field. 
Don’t be surprised if the young 
wide receiver grabs attention 
on Friday night, too. 

4. Don Brown’s new defense 

(starring Jabrill Peppers)

Redshirt sophomore Jabrill 

Peppers could be found on both 
sides of the ball last season, but 
so far this spring, he’s spent 
all of his time on defense. 
Peppers is a big asset for first-
year 
Michigan 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown, who’s 
using Peppers in multiple ways. 

Brown 
likes 
Peppers 
at 

the SAM linebacker position, 
estimating that he spends about 
70 percent of his time at the 
position. He likely allots the rest 
of his time at safety or nickelback. 
The 
Wolverines 
might 
put 

Peppers on offense for the first 
time during the Spring Game for 
the crowd’s enjoyment, but don’t 
expect too much from him there. 
No promises on defensive scores, 
though. 

Brown left Boston College 

after leading the Eagles to the 
best total defense in the nation 
in 2015, and he’s taking over 
the remnants of the fourth-
best total defense. With the 
combination of returning talent 
and coaching, it’s expected that 
Michigan’s defense will be of 
similar strength to last season’s. 

Brown is known as “Dr. Blitz” 

for a reason, so keep watch on 
the defense if you can tear your 
eyes away from the quarterback 
competition.

Michigan ousted from WNIT

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Throughout 
the 
Women’s 

National 
Invitational 

Tournament, Madison Ristovski 
has told her 
teammates, 
“This 
isn’t 

going 
to 

be my last game,” while still 
playing like it will be. With every 
performance Ristovski had in 
the WNIT, she has played the 
best basketball of her career to 
delay the last time she dons the 
maize and blue.

But in the Final Four against 

Florida Gulf Coast on Thursday, 
the senior guard could no longer 
prolong the end. Ristovski scored 

19 points, but it was in vain, as 
the Wolverines fell, 71-62, to end 
their season.

Since the Eagles’ inaugural 

season in Division I in 2007, 
they have won more than 90 
percent of their home games 
at their home Alico Center — a 
win percentage second only to 
Connecticut during that time 
span. That figure alone was a 
hint that Michigan would need 
everything they had to pull out a 
victory in its first time away from 
Crisler Center in the WNIT.

“It definitely helps in this 

tournament to play on your 
home court, a place where you 
shoot and practice every day,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I think that definitely 

played into their advantage, but 
they still made shots and they 
did what they needed to do to 
seal the game down the stretch 
when we made that run.”

The 
Eagles 
(33-5) 
scored 

the first basket of the game 
with a 3-pointer, but soon after 
they went into a four-minute 
drought, shooting 0-for-8 while 
the Wolverines went on a 9-0 
run before a timeout at the 4:54 
mark in the first quarter. Florida 
Gulf Coast didn’t remain quiet 
for much longer, though, as it 
knocked down its next three 
3-pointers to take the lead. The 
Eagles used their hot shooting 
from distance to cap off the first 
quarter with a 13-2 run to take 
the lead, 16-11.

Michigan (22-14) struggled to 

take care of the ball in the first 
frame, committing six turnovers 
that turned into 11 points for the 
Eagles. The Wolverines went on 
an 8-0 run and took over the lead 
twice for brief moments in the 
beginning of the second quarter, 
but Florida Gulf Coast regained 
momentum at the end of the first 
half with a blocked shot and a 
coast-to-coast layup to go up 
by six. The Wolverines had one 
more opportunity to score before 
the end of the half, but freshman 
center Hallie Thome was denied 
at the rim.

“I wish I had that first and 

second quarter back to change 
the tempo a little more like we 
did in the second half,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They exposed our 
young defenders and they did a 
great job of that.”

Florida Gulf Coast’s defense, 

which allows 49.1 points per 
game — second-fewest in the 
nation behind Connecticut — 
proved its legitimacy against 
Michigan in the first half. The 
Wolverines shot 10-for-28 from 
the floor while giving up 10 
turnovers to fall behind, 28-22, 
by halftime. The Eagles made 
only one more shot than the 

Wolverines, but they made four 
more 3-pointers and six fewer 
turnovers, giving their senior-
laden squad confidence going 
into the break. Zero Michigan 
players scored in double digits 
at the half, as sophomore guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
led 
the 

Wolverines with six points on 30 
percent shooting.

“They scout the heck out of 

you and I think that they know 
their personnel and make other 
people have to beat you,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They take away your 
top guys and they put everybody 
else in the paint and they make 
those other guys have to play to 
beat you. They block out, they 
give you one shot, and they get 
back in defensive transition.”

Michigan didn’t score in the 

first two minutes of the third 

quarter, turning the ball over 
two more times along the way 
before Ristovski knocked down 
a 3-pointer to get it going. But 
Florida Gulf Coast matched the 
shot with a triple of its own to 
push the lead to seven. The Eagles 
led by as much as 10 in the third 
quarter, but finished it leading by 
just two due to Ristovski’s play. 
Putting the team on her back 
while the cold-shooting Flaherty 
was on the bench for the majority 
of the half, Ristovski dropped 12 
points and dished out two assists 
in the third quarter to keep the 
Wolverines close while the rest 
of her team struggled.

The game stayed close deep 

into the fourth and, with just 
over three minutes left to go in 
regulation, Flaherty sank two 
free throws to cut the deficit 

to two again, 59-57. After a 
defensive stop, the Wolverines 
took the lead after Flaherty made 
her first 3-pointer of the game. 
But again, the Eagles battled back 
with another make from behind 
the arc. Florida Gulf Coast’s next 
possession ended with another 
3-pointer that deflected off the 
rim and went in at the shot-
clock buzzer to push the lead 
to five with a minute left. Only 
managing a pair of free throws 
down the stretch, Michigan was 
unable to climb back again.

The Wolverines saw their 

season end at the exact same 
point this year as they did last 
year — in the Final Four of the 
WNIT. And even with a desperate 
effort from Ristovski, the team 
once again fell short of hoisting 
its first banner at Crisler Center.

Michigan seeks to answer 
questions against Indiana 

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

In 
the 
Michigan 
softball 

team’s loss to Northwestern last 
Friday, Sierra Romero filled in at 
shortstop. As a 
routine ground 
ball 
made 
its 

way 
to 
the 

senior, it slipped 
through 
her 

legs, 
allowing 

two 
Wildcats 

to score. And 
with the added 
cushion 
of 

those two runs, 
Northwestern 
survived 
the 

Wolverines’ 
spirited seventh-
inning comeback and won, 13-12.

The next day, Romero moved 

back to second base as junior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez made 
her return to the field, injecting a 
sense of normalcy into Michigan’s 
infield and exuding confidence in 
the lineup.

“(Ramirez) is a player who 

shows up to do her part,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“That is one of the things I love 
about her the most.”

Though she usually hits second, 

Ramirez hit ninth and notched 
one hit in four at-bats, keeping her 
batting average above .400.

“I thought she did as well as she 

could do,” Hutchins said. “I don’t 
think she is … 100 percent or her 
speed is all there, but we just need 
her to do the best with what she 
has.”

In 
Ramirez’s 
three-game 

absence, due to an ankle injury, 
Hutchins 
inserted 
freshman 

Faith Canfield at second base 
for Romero. Canfield excelled, 
hitting .333 with a home run and 
three RBI.

“Faith is a role player, not a 

bench player,” Hutchins said. “Her 
role is to fill in where we need her 
and … she is very capable of doing 
anything we need her to do.”

As strength is restored to 

the Wolverines’ middle infield, 
questions surround the rest of 

No. 2 Michigan (2-1 Big Ten, 24-3 
overall) as it prepares for three 
away 
games 
in 
Bloomington 

against Indiana (3-0, 20-10).

During 
the 
Wolverines’ 

collapse on Friday, catcher Alex 
Sobczak’s inexperience showed 
itself as the freshman struggled 
to deal with low-thrown pitches, 
allowing several to make their 
way to the backstop.

Sobczak lost her place in the 

lineup for the series’ final two 
games, giving way to sophomore 
catcher Aidan Falk.

Hutchins gave no hints as to 

who will be catching against 
the Hoosiers, stating only that, 
“(Sobczak) is one of our catchers.”

Though 
uncertainty 
marks 

the catcher position, there is 
little doubt as to the improved 
performances of junior pitcher 
Megan Betsa on Saturday and 
Sara Driesenga on Friday.

Coming into Friday’s game 

in a relief role, Betsa struggled, 
garnering zero outs, walking 
three and allowing four earned 
runs. Saturday, Betsa continued 
to give up an inordinate amount 
of walks — five in total — but 
found a way to work through 

jams, as 12 strikeouts proved to 
be the difference between further 
Northwestern 
scoring 
and 

Michigan returning to bat.

As 
the 
public 
relations 

department touted the game as 
“Sara Driesenga Day,” last Friday 
turned out to be anything but 
for the hard-throwing right-
hander. While Driesenga started 
in commanding fashion, the top 
of Northwestern’s lineup got to 
her in the fifth inning, when she 
put two early runners on base. 
The Wildcats used that as a 
springboard to construct a seven-
run scoring inning.

Returning to the mound for 

the series finale, Driesenga tossed 
four solid innings, allowing only 
one earned run and restoring 
confidence 
to 
Michigan’s 

beleaguered pitching staff.

As Betsa and Driesenga return 

to their confident selves, the 
return 
of 
defensive 
stalwart 

Ramirez is sure to be a boon for 
the defense. However, it won’t 
solve all of the Wolverines’ 
problems, as more consistency 
from the pitching staff holds the 
key to Michigan’s success against 
the Hoosiers.
