BIG TEN FOOTBALL
Paterno fired
amid scandal
after 46 years
at Penn State

Football coach and
Penn State president
dismissed from
positions last night
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The Penn State Board of
Trustees fired legendary foot-
ball coach Joe Paterno and Penn
State University President Gra-
ham Spanier amid a sex abuse
scandal.
At 10:14 p.m. yesterday, the
Board of Trustees announced
in an unanimous decision the
immediate dismissal of Spanier
and Paterno.
"Joe Paterno is no longer the
head coach, effective immediate-
ly," said Vice Chair of the Board
of Trustees John P. Surma.
The 84-year-old Paterno had
led the Nittany Lions since 1966
- he was both the longest-ten-
ured and winningest coach in
college football history.
The announcement came in
the wake of a sex abuse scan-
dal that has centered around an
ongoing investigation into for-
mer Penn State defensive coor-

dinator Jerry Sandusky's alleged
abuse of young boys in his Sec-
ond Mile nonprofit organization.
Paterno was reportedly was
made aware of a situation involv-
ing Sandusky and a young boy
in the showers at the Penn State
football facility nine years ago. A
graduate assistant notified Pater-
no, and Paterno gave the report
to Penn State Athletic Director
Tim Curley, saying the gradu-
ate assistant had seen Sandusky
"fondling or doing something of
a sexual nature to the boy."
Sandusky was told not to bring
any more children from the Sec-
ond Mile to campus. That was
the only action taken.
"I am absolutely devastated by
the developments in this case,"
Paterno said in a statement
released Wednesday. "I grieve
for the children and their fami-
lies, and I pray for their comfort
and relief.
"This is a tragedy. It is one
of the great sorrows of my life.
With the benefit of hindsight, I
wish I had done more."
The Board of Trustee's deci-
sion came 12 hours after Paterno
released a statement stating his
intentions to retire after the sea-
son, which would allow him to

GOP hopefuls discuss,
economy, student debt

Presidential
candidates debate at
Oakland University
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
ROCHESTER, Mich. - Slated
to focus on economic issues, the
Republican presidential primary
debate last night encompassed

a wide range of topics including
international affairs, health care
and the federal student loan pro-
gram.
The debate, held at Oakland
University, featured GOP candi-
dates former Massachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney, former Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich, U.S.
Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-
Minn.), former Utah Gov. Jon
Huntsman, Herman Cain, Texas
Gov. Rick Perry, U.S. Rep. Ron

Paul (R-Texas) and U.S. Sen. Rick
Santorum (R-Penn.).
When answering the debate's
opening question, all the can-
didates hesitated to promote
financial support for Europe's
struggling economy. Cain and
Romney expressed a desire to
focus on supporting the domestic
economy over offering interna-
tional economic aid. Romney dis-
cussed his seemingly two-sided
record offavoringabailoutforthe

Detroit auto industry in2008 and
then later retracting his support.
"I care about this state and
about auto industrylike - Iguess
like no one else on this stage,"
Romney said. "My view with
regards to the bailout was that
whether it wasby President Bush
or by President Obama, it was the
wrong way to go. I said from the
very beginning they should go
through a managed bankruptcy

STATE LEGISLATION
Anti-bullying bill
causes contention

House is rewriting
bill to remove
controversial clause
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
State Rep. Rick Jones (R-
Grand Ledge) is familiar with
the troubles of bullied youth.
His son, he said, was "pushed
around" and tormented by bul-
lies during his middle and high
school years, and the grand-
daughter of one of his close
former colleagues commit-

ted suicide after being bullied
throughout high school.
Jones said those experiences
inspired him to sponsor an anti-
bullying bill, which has raised
controversy after a state caucus
attorney added a provision to
the bill prohibiting schools from
giving punishments as a result of
bullying in the form of "a state-
ment of a sincerely held religious
belief or moral conviction of a
school employee, school volun-
teer, pupil or a pupil's parent or
guardian."
The clause, some legislators

UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY
'U' begins project to improve cell phone service in buildings

Increased coverage
expected to be
complete in 2013
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
Campus community mem-
bers may become more closely
connected due to a new Univer-

sity effort to improve cell phone
service.
Over the next two years,
University Information and
Technology Services will work
with cell phone providers like
Verizon to improve cell phone
reception in University build-
ings, Michigan Stadium and
the University Hospital. After a
successful trial in five buildings
on North Campus, permanent

installation of cellular tech-
nology started this month and
is expected to be completed in
2013.
Andrew Palms, executive
director of Communications
Systems and Data Centers at
the University, said the change
is due to complaints about poor
cell phone coverage on campus.
"A couple of years ago, it
became clear we had a number

of places that did not have good
coverage ..." Palms said. "We
decided it was time to do some-
thing about it."
The project aims to provide
service in more buildings and
increase the number of mobile
devices the service area can
handle, according to Palms.
"In (Michigan) Stadium on
a Monday, there's great cover-
age," Palms said. "The problem

is capacity. If you have 10 peo-
ple in the stadium it's fine, but
100,000 is a problem."
According to Paul Killey,
executive director of informa-
tion technology at the College
of Engineering, the college is
highly interested in the project
and volunteered to be part of
the trial.

Observing history

Tunisia hosted its first
democratic election in
late October. How did you
become an election observ-
er for Tunisia?
I received an e-mail from
the Carter Center asking me
if I would go. They contacted
me because I have written
about Tunisia and have been
involved in human rights
work in the region. I am on
.the board of Amnesty Inter-
national and do a lot of human
rights work in and outside the
U.S. When I was in Tunisia in
June 2011, I was helping the
Amnesty section of Tunisia to
get back on its feet.
As an election observer in

Tunisia, what amazed you
most about the experience?
It was amazing just how
many details they took into
account and how dedicat-
ed they were to following
instructions. For example,
the army was asked to deliver
the ballot boxes all across the
country. Two soldiers were
left at each polling station and
actually slept in sleeping bags
next to the ballot boxes all
night long before the polling
began the next day.
How did you come to
teach at the University?
I came to the University in
2001 to join the Ford School of
Public Policy, and I had at that

Professor Susan Waltz from the Ford School of Public Policy
website.

Suspect arraigned for USS Cole
attack after 9-year detainment

Trial will take place
under military
commision system
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL
BASE, Cuba (AP) - A Saudi con-
sidered among the most senior
figures in al-Qaida emerged yes-
terday from nine years of secret
confinement to face charges of
orchestrating the deadly attack
on the USS Cole in the start of
a new round of Guantanamo
Bay war crimes tribunals under
a president who vowed to halt
them.
Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri
did not enter a plea as he was
arraigned and the court dealt
with a number of procedural
issues. The detainee, who was
subjected to the harsh interro-
gation techniques that his law-
yers say amounted to torture,
appeared engaged and occasion-
ally smiled as he responded to
questions from the judge.
The charges against Al-
Nashiri, 46, include murder in

violation of the law of war in the
2000 suicide bombing of the USS
Cole in Yemen, an attack killed
17 crew members. Authorities
say he took orders directly from
Osama bin Laden and also set
up the October 2002 bombing
of the French supertanker MV
Limburg, which killed one crew-
man, as well as a failed attack on
another American warship, the.
USS The Sullivans in January
2000.
He was allowed to remain
unshackled, declined an offer
to exchange his white prison
uniform for civilian clothes in
future court appearances and
said he wants to keep all the
members of his appointed legal
team. "At this moment these
lawyers are doing the right job,"
he told the judge.
It was a low-key start to a
highly anticipated proceeding,
the start of a capital case against
a prisoner who was held in a
series of clandestine CIA prisons
where he was subjected to the
simulated drowning technique
known as waterboarding as well
as mock executions and other

forms of harsh interrogation.
President Barack Obama took
office pledgingtoclose the Guan-
tanamo Bay detention center, but
was rebuffed by Congress, which
has refused to authorize moving
prisoners from the American
base in Cuba, and forced him to
resume the war crimes prosecu-
tions started under his predeces-
sor.
Three Guantanamo cases
have been resolved through
plea bargains under Obama but
al-Nashiri is the first initiated
under this administration and
it is considered a prelude to the
prosecution of the five Guanta-
namo prisoners who are accused
of orchestrating the Sept. 11
attacks.
The trial of al-Nashiri will
take place under a military com-
mission system that has been
revised by Congress and the
Obama administration but isstill
subject to criticism from defense
lawyers and human rights
groups, who have complained
about repeated changes in pro-
cedures and rules that favor the
prosecution.
Legal experts have also
questioned whether al-Nashiri
should be charged with a war
crime for the Cole bombing,
which occurred before the Sept.
11 attacks and the U.S. declara-
tion of war on al-Qaida.
Critics such as retired Air
Force Col. Morris Davis, who
resigned as chief prosecutor for
the trials in October 2007 after
alleging political interference by
superiors, said the case against
al-Nashiri and other prisoners
should be moved to U.S. federal
court to avoid having the convic-
tions perceived as illegitimate.
"There is ample evidence to
prove his case in federal court,
where there is a long history of
trying terrorism cases and cer-
tainly not this presumption of a
kangaroo court," Davis said.
Al-Nashiri was captured in
2002 in Dubai and was held by
the CIA in a series of secret pris-
ons before being sent to Guanta-
namo in September 2006.

ing, we have been getting a lot
of feedback from students, fac-
ulty and staff that cell phones
are becoming more important
for convenience and safety,"
Killey said.
- Improved cell phone reception
might bringstudents a new range
of distractions in the form of
texting and smartphone use, but
Killey said those issues will be
decided on a class-by-class basis.
"It is up to the instructor
to decide if it is a problem," he

said. "... It can be a challenge or
an opportunity - however you
want to look at it."
LSA freshman Stasha Yan-
cho said some of her classes use
cell phones in place of iClickers,
which can be a problem if there
is poor cell phone reception.
"One lecture uses cell phones
instead of iClickers, so it's
annoying when you get points
off just because you don't have
service," Yancho said.
Engineering sophomore Joe
Riley said he thinks class will be
more enjoyable after the project

is implemented since it aims to
improve cell phone service in
academic buildings.
"Being able to communicate
with others, I don't feel isolated
anymore," Riley said.
LSA freshman Sammie Levin
said cell phone service is an
issue in residence halls and Uni-
versity buildings like the Mod-
ern Languages Building.
"I lose calls all the time from
my room and the (MLB) gets no
service," Levin said. "(It's) not
a huge problem, but it could be
improved."

550,000 Toyota cars
recalled worldwide

No accidents or
injuries have been
reported as a result
of the defect
TOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor
Corp. said yesterday it is recall-
ing about 550,000 vehicles
worldwide - mostly in the Unit-
ed States - for problems that
could make it harder to steer.
The recall affects 447,000
vehicles in North America, as
well as 38,000 in Japan and
another 25,000 in Australia

and New Zealand, said Toyota
spokesman Dion Corbett. In
Europe some 14,000 vehicles
are being recalled along with
10,000 in the Middle East and
14,000 in Asia outside Japan.
Toyota has received a total of
79 reports about the defect dat-
ing back to 2007, said Corbett.
There have been no reports of
accidents or injuries related to
the problems, he said.
Toyota's reputation has taken
a hit over the last two years due
to a string of huge recalls that
have ballooned to 14 million
vehicles over that time, includ-
ing millions recalled last year

for acceleration problems. It
faces damage lawsuits and lin-
gering doubts in the U.S. about
whether it had been transparent
enough about the recall woes.
Japan's largest automaker
has been trying to communi-
cate better with customers and
empower regional operations
outside Japan to make safety
decisions.
The news comes a day after
Toyota said its July-September
profit slid 18.5 percent to 80.4
billion yen ($1 billion) on plung-
ing sales caused by parts short-
ages from the tsunami disaster
in northeastern Japan.

Occupy protesters
start march from
NYC to D.C.
About two dozen Occupy Wall
Street protesters have started a
two-week walk from New York
to Washington.
The activists left Manhattan's
Zuccotti Park yesterday. Police
on scooters flanked them as they
marched past the World Trade
Center site toward a ferry pier.
They planned to resume
their walk in New Jersey and go
through Pennsylvania, Delaware
and Maryland, then arrive in
Washington by Nov. 23.
That's the deadline for a con-
gressional committee to decide
whether to keep President Barack
Obama's extension of Bush-era
tax cuts. Protesters say the cuts
benefit only rich Americans.
They hope to pick up other
participants along their 240-

the effort to long-distance walks
during the civil rights era.

Students go on
strike in Brazil
after police raid
Students at one of Brazil's
most elite universities are going
on strike a day after riot police
forcibly removed them from an
occupied building on campus.
The students voted for the strike
after police raided an administra-
tion building and arrested 70 stu-
dents who were protesting police
patrols on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Sao Paulo.
A judge had ordered them to
leave the building by late Mon-
day, but the group refused.
Students complain they are
subjected to random searches and
intimidation by police on campus.
University administrators and
police signed an agreement in
September that allowed police
* to begin patrols in response to a

wave of assaults on campus.
ISLAMABAD
Aid running out
for victims of
Pakistan floods
International aid agencies
warn they are running short of
money and supplies to help mil-
lions of people affected by floods
in Pakistan.
The statement was issued yes-
terday by the United Nations and
several other aid groups, includ-
ing Oxfam, Save the Children,
Care and ACTED.
The U.N. says it has only raised
$96.5 million of the $357 million
six-month appeal it issued in Sep-
tember. It says relief supplies will
run out in weeks without more
money.
Oxfam has only raised about
$13 million of its $35 million
appeal and will have to cut back
help to nearly 4 million people at
the beginning of the year.
The floods first hit Pakistan
in August following unusually
* heavy monsoon rains and have
affected over 9 million people.

Somalia still suffering

Nearly 2 million
Somalis without
access to food
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - As
Minhaj Gedi Farah lay silently
on a hospital bed three months
ago, even his mother had given
up hope that the skeletal Soma-
li baby would live. Weeks of
intensive feeding, though, have
transformed him into a chubby-
cheeked boy who crawls.
The is one of several sto-
ries highlighted yesterday in
an annual New York fundrais-
ing event held by the aid group
International Rescue Commit-
tee, which helped nurse Minhaj
back to health.
Famine has claimed the lives
of tens of thousands of Somali
children this year, but the U.N.
said despite restrictions by
Islamist insurgents, heavy rains
and fighting, aid agencies are
expanding their reach. Food aid
is now getting to 2.2 million of
the 4 million Somalis who need
it, the U.N. said.
"His mother never thought
he would recover. Every mem-

ber of his family is happy," said
Sirat Amin, a nurse-nutritionist
with the International Rescue
Committee who has been moni-
toring Minhaj's progress. "He
can sit without being supported,
he can have (nutritional supple-
ment) Plumpynut on his own.
He's crawling."
In July, the month that the
U.N. declared parts of Somalia
famine zones, Minhaj was one
of dozens of limp babies lying
under mosquito net shrouds in
the sweltering wards of the IRC
hospital in Dadaab, the world's
largest refugee camp. Seven-
month-old Minhaj weighedonly
3.2 kilograms (7.05 pounds), less
than some newborns.
Pictures of his gaunt cheeks
and bulging eyes made him the
face of the famine. But after
weeks of intensive feeding with
Plumpynut - a kind of sweet-
ened peanut butter packed with
nutrients - he is nearly 8 kilo-
grams (17.64 pounds), almost
normal for aboy his age.
Since the beginning of the
year, hundreds of thousands of
Somali families have poured
over the border, fleeing war and
hunger. Domes made from dirty

tarpaulins and scraps of cloth
mushroomed on the scrub-
lands of northern Kenya and the
U.N.'s famine announcement
brought planeloads of television
crews to capture images of their
suffering.
Now the torrent of refugees
fleeing into Kenya has slowed
to a trickle and the camera
crews have gone home. But that
doesn't mean the emergency is
over.
Nearly 2 million Somalis still
don't have access to food aid.
Rain has turned tracks through
the bush to slush and there's
been fighting along the border
after hundreds of Kenyan sol-
diers crossed into Somalia. Last
month's incursion followed a
string of kidnappings on Kenyan
soil by Somali gunmen.
Families wanting to flee may
fear being . caught up in the
fighting or be stuck in the mud.
Only the strongest are getting
through. When they arrive,
they are not only starving but
sick and exhausted, Amin said.
So although less are coming,
when they arrive in the refugee
camps in Kenya many are in a
more severe state of starvation.

process, a private bankruptcy pro-
cess."
The candidates moved on to
discuss tax plans and govern-
ment regulation, during which
Cain's famous 9-9-9 plan took
center stage. The sexual harass-
ment allegations against Cain were
mentioned briefly and quickly dis-
missed when Cain said they were
"unfounded accusations."
"I value my character and my
integrity more than anything else,"
Cain said. "And for every one pr-
son that comes forward with a false
accusation, there are probably ...
thousands who would say none of
that sort of activity ever came from
Herman Cain."
The candidates' initiatives to cut
government spending and restruc-
ture the tax system were met with
applause and enthusiasm from
the audience, particularly when
Paul announced his desire to cut
$1 trillion from the federal budget
during his first year in office. The
candidates frequently reiterated
their support of businesses and the
imporanceof a free marketsystem.
"The right thing for America is
to have profitable enterprises that
can hire people," Romney said. "I
want to make Americanbusinesses
successful and thrive. What we
have in Washington today is a pres-
ident and an administration that
doesn't like business, that some-
how thinks they wantjobs,but they
don't like businesses."
The topic of economics based
on laissez-faire principles contin-
ued as the debate shifted into the
health care sector. Each candi-
date expressed their opposition to
Obama's health care law and said
they would act to repeal it upon
entering office.
The candidates disagreed, how-
ever, on the issue of the costly fed-
eral student loan program. Paul
announced his desire to cut the
program entirely in addition to
eliminating the Department of
Education to make education more
cost effective and beneficial for
students.
"So when the government gets
involved in the delivery of any ser-
vice - whether it's education, med-
ical care, or housing - they cause
higher prices, lower quality, create
bubbles and they give us this mess
thatwe'rein," Paul said.
Gingrich pointed to the College
of the Ozarks in Oliver Township,
Mo. - that uses a work-study pro-
gram in which students work 20
hours each week in exchange for a
free education - as an example of
an ideally cheap and high quality
approach to funding higher educa-
tion. But he called the program so
unusual that most young Ameri-
cans would experience a "culture
shock" if the system were changed.
Jesse Benton, Paul's national
campaign manager who spoke
with The Michigan Daily after the
debate, said Paul's plan does not
entail the immediate removal of
federal student loans, but rather

a gradual shift away from depen-
dency on the program so govern-
ment spending is minimized and
the quality of American education
is maintained.
"The truth is that the federalostu-
dent loan program has completely
messed up our higher education
system," Benton said. "Look at
the exploding cost and look at the
diminishing quality. Look at the job
market we're handing our students
whenthey getout and work."
In an interview with the Daily
after the debate, Santorum said the
increasing amount of federal sub-
sidies provided to students greatly
attributes to the skyrocketing cost
of higher education. He added that
in many regards, the costs associat-
ed with attending college, like the
price of textbooks, is a "scam." Ulti-
mately, the current state of higher
education is hindering the ability
for students to learn effectively,
Santorum said.
"There's all these artificial costs
that are built into a college educa-
tion, and they can get away with it
because kids aren't feeling the real
impact of the cost if they're bor-
rowing all that money and we have
to change that," Santorum said.
LSA sophomore Russ Hayes, a
member of the University's chap-
ter of College Republicans, was in
attendance at the debate and said
in an interview afterward that the
general sense of accordance among
the eightccandidates was important
to showcase the candidates' desire
- regardless of their background -
to progress the nation.
"Overall that consensus, that
universal agreement that some-
thing needed to change, that was
important," Hayes said.
Hayes said he agreed with com-
ments made by Paul regarding
divesting federal funds from high-
er education funding since it cul-
tivates higher inflation rates and
ultimately encumbers students'
abilities to find post-graduate
employment.
"The argument is that when the
federal government loans money
to people it inflates the value of an
education," Hayes said. "Education
is key. I think all sides agree that
education is incredibly important,
and what we need is people to get
jobs with their degrees."
Hayes added that despite the
lauding of education among gov-
ernment officials, the reality is
that students are failing to obtain
jobs with their degrees, creating
an issue similar tothe housingbub-
ble, as Paul mentioned, in which
students invest a large amount of
money that leads to little pay off, or
evenbankruptcy, in the longrun.
"The problem is we have people
coming out of college with degrees,
and they're just not working,"
Hayes said. "The degree is not what
it was 10 to 15 years ago. The prob-
lem that Ron Paul and a lot of the
Republican candidates see is this
bubble of education like what we
saw with the housing bubble. The
worry is if we keep pouring grants
and pouring loans to students that
won't be able to afford it and willbe
in debt, that's a worry."

Immigration crackdown leads
to labor shortage for harvest

About 70 percent
of Washington
farmworkers are
illegal immigrants
YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -
Apple growers say they could
have had one of their best years
ever if a shortage of workers
hadn't forced them to leave
some fruit on trees.
Growers inWashington state,
which produces about half of
the nation's apples, say the labor
shortage was made worse by a
late start to their harvest. The
growing season got off to a
slow start because of a cold, wet
spring, and some migrant work-
ers didn't stick around to wait
for it.
But farmers say an immigra-
tion crackdown by the federal
government and states such as
Arizona and Alabama scared
off many more workers. They
have tried to replace them with
domestic workers with little
success and inmates at a much
greater cost. Many growers
have resorted to posting "pick-
ers wanted" signs outside their
orchards and asking neighbors
to send prospective workers
their way.
Jeff Pheasant and his sister
Darla Grubb are the fourth gen-
eration in their family to grow
apples near Soap Lake, about
120 miles east of Seattle. They
said their harvest was a week
behind because the fruit wasn't
ripe, then another week behind
because they had no workers to
pick it.
Pheasant Orchards usually
has 65 workers at the peak of

harvest. Only 50 pickers arrived
this year, and many were inex-
perienced, Pheasant said.
"You have to have people,"
Grubb said. "They're the reason
we have fruits and vegetables.
We couldn't do this without our
workers."
About 15 billion apples are
picked in Washington each
year, all by hand. Orchards line
the hillsides and valleys east
of the Cascade Range from the
Canadian border in the north
to the Columbia River in the
south.
Growers have struggled for
years with labor shortages, but
they say this harvest season is
one of the toughest yet. Typi-
cally, about 70 percent of the
state's farmworkers are in the
country illegally. But many
Mexican and other migrant
workers stayed away this year
after some states passed tough-
er immigration laws and the
federal government cracked
down.
"We've been dealing with
this for a number of years now,
and until something changes at
the federal level, growers are
going to struggle having enough
workers," said Mike Gempler, a
farm labor contractor for Wash-
ington growers.
Gov. Chris Gregoire assem-
bled a delegation of 15 farmers
last month for a trip to Wash-
ington, D.C., where they urged
Congress to enact comprehen-
sive immigration reform. At the
time, Gregoire estimated the
state still needed 4,000 workers
to complete the harvest, which
could have been the third-larg-
est in state history.
"Our problem now is: How do
we get it off the trees?" Gregoire

said. "We don't have a work
force, and that is at the doorstop
of the federal government."
Farmers in other states also
are struggling with a labor
shortage. A Georgia pilot pro-
gram matching probationers
with farmers needing harvest-
ers had mixed results. Some
Alabama farmers tried hiring
American citizens after the
state's new immigration law
chased away migrant workers,
but they said the new employees
were often ready to call it a day
by mid-afternoon. Many quit
after a day or two.
In Washington, a state office
that matches workers with
available jobs posted hundreds
of openings at orchards with
few takers, and many farmers
complained that those who did
apply were too inexperienced.
Some critics say growers
would have enough workers if
they paid more. Washington
has the highest minimum wage
in the country at $8.67 per hour.
Apple pickers are often paid
based on how much they pick,
but they're guaranteed at least
minimum wage.
Erik Nicholson, Pacific
Northwest director for the
United Farmworkers of Amer-
ica labor union, said that's not
enough to attract a steady labor
supply.
A growing number of farmers
have turned to a federal guest-
worker program to bring in
foreign workers, despite long-
standing complaints that it's
too cumbersome and expensive
to be of any real help. Growers
in the program generally must
pay a higher wage, plus provide
housing and transportation in
and out of the country.

Life sentence too long
State should reconsider juvenile lifer policy
M ichigan has more juvenile lifers - people between age 14
and 17 who are sentenced to life in prison without the
opportunity for parole - than every state except Penn-
sylvania. With 358 people currently serving life sentences who were
convicted as juveniles, this is not a ranking the state should be eager
to maintain. While some of these young people committed heinous
crimes, some were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Michigan
lawmakers must re-evaluate the policy of life sentences for juveniles
because some of these youth may deserve a second chance.

Some of the charges that can result in a life
sentence include first-degree murder and sec-
ond-degree murder. A life sentence is unrea-
sonable for some youth who receive these,
charges. This was the case for Keith Maxey,
who at age 16 fled the scene of an attempted
drug theft in 2007 in which another person
was killed. Maxey was unarmed and was shot
during the incident, but he was still charged
with felony murder and sentenced to life in
prison. He is currently involved in a federal
lawsuit against the state to overturn the life
sentence.
The purpose of the penitentiary system is
not to keep criminals locked up forever but to
provide an opportunity to rehabilitate them
back into society. Criminals who enter the sys-
tem as youth are more likely to go through this
process successfully. A person undergoes major
psychological and personal changes from ado-
lescence to adulthood, and young criminals are
no exception. These individuals should be re-
evaluated to see if they have changed from the
time they committed their crime.
The state should grant convicted juveniles
a second chance at a free life if the state feels
they are genuinely remorseful. Teenagers who
are convicted of serious crimes should still face
substantial jail time, but allowing them to be

sentenced as adults to lifetime imprisonment
without parole is unjust. Michigan should not
exclusively treat juveniles as adults in murder
convictions, but should evaluate crimes com-
mitted by youth on a case-by-case basis.
Michigan should also provide services to
help imprisoned juveniles learn to understand
the impact of their crimes and what led to the
decisions they made. Offering counseling and
mental health services could help with this
rehabilitation process. Trained mental health
professionals should routinely monitor a juve-
nile's mental health.
Locking up juveniles for the duration of
their lives is also an extreme financial burden
for Michigan citizens. Supporting juvenile lif-
ers costs Michigan residents more than $10
million each year. Taxpayers must foot the bill
for food, clothing and medical care for every
prisoner. The longer a juvenile is imprisoned,
the more expensive it becomes for taxpayers.
There are terrible crimes committed by
young people that are unforgivable and deserv-
ing of a life sentence. But as is the case with
Maxey's conviction, this is not always the cir-
cumstance. Michigan needs to reconsider its
current treatment of juvenile lifer convictions
and make sure it gives all criminals fair treat-
ment under the law.

W e're approaching
Thanksgiving, our
all-American harvest
festival. Theo-
logian Reinhold
Niebuhr once
asked if it was
"really possible -1
to have an hon-
est Thanks- "
giving in an
industrial civili- JOEL
zation." Instead BATTERMAN
of celebrat-
ing the gifts of
nature and nature's God, he wor-
ried, the holiday risked becoming
a collective pat on the back, since
humans thought they mastered
nature with their machines. That
might be true. But ina development
Niebuhr might not have anticipat-
ed, some of the most industrialized
youth who've ever lived are now
looking to find honest work beyond
industrial civilization.
A surprising number of students I
know are going into novel fields, so
to speak. They're working on organ-
ic farms scattered across the coun-
try: at the shores of Lake Michigan,
against the foothills of the Rockies,
on a small island off the coast of
Washington, even in the post-indus-
trial cities of the Rust Belt. For some,
agriculture is a temporary activity.
"WWOOFing," or taking advantage
of World Wide Opportunities on
Organic Farms, is an easy route to a
summer, semester or longer period
of farm work in exchange for room
(or tent) and board. For others,
agrarian living is a lifelong vocation.
I haven't spent more than a day
on one of these farms myself, but
I can understand their attraction,
especially for a set of environmen-
tally conscious, fairly privileged

students from professional fami-
lies. Many aspects of industrial
civilization are getting hard to deal
with, not just at a global level, but at
a personal level as well. The agrari-
an escape can provide a way out, for
individuals who pursue it, though
I'm less sure whether it would work
for society as a whole.
If you think about it, getting back
down to Earth is a logical response
for young people confronting the
hyperextension of higher educa-
tion, the joke that's the job market
and the crazed competition that
dominates both. It's no wonder that
some of us are forsakingthe resume
rush for an occupation that tends
to emphasize cooperation, stability
and a slower pace of production. No
plant is going to complain if you're
a few minutes late with the water.
Farming also involves making
real, tangible products - stuff you
can sink your teeth into, which
citizens of this country don't do too
often anymore. Indeed, many pro-
fessional students don't get to do
any kind of real work at all. Educa-
tor John Dewey warned about the
"loss of moral power that arises
from the constant impression that
nothing is worth doing in itself, but
only as a preparation for something
else, which in turn is only a get-
ting ready for some genuinely seri-
ous end beyond." When you grow
things, though, you can have your
crops and eat them too.
Then there's the political sub-
text. For many practitioners, do-it-
yourself agriculture offers a radical
alternative to industrial civilization
and its evils - from McDonald's to
climate change. These practitioners
see growing food as the first step in
a new agricultural revolution that
would eliminate the unequal rela-

tionship between producer and
consumer, shake off supply chains
and liberate local communities
from global capital.
The agrarian
adventure
has promise.
I have some doubts about that.
It can be hard to separate what's
revolutionary from what's merely
therapeutic. The metaphor of "cul-
tivating our garden," observed by
1960s activist and historian Todd
Gitlin, often represents "the tradi-
tional middle class way of renounc-
ing the world." Some student farm
workers hint at that notion. "I'm
not sure that I can change ... poli-
tics in Washington, but here I can
see the fruits of my labor," one
told a reporter, while another says
he's gained self-reliance, a classic
industrial virtue contradicting the
natural interdependencies Niebuhr
mourned. Meanwhile, the planet
burns and 3 million immigrant
farm workers in this country lack
the rights we take for granted.
The agrarian adventure has
promise. We badly need alternative
models to industrial civilization.
Yet I tend to think the best farms
will be the ones that also foster con-
tinuous engagement with the soci-
ety beyond their fences. We require
hands to sow the seeds of change,
but we also need others to redis-
tribute the harvest they reap.

Spare some change for change

In her viewpoint (Workshop in need of a
remix, 11/8/11) Jesse Klein asserts that the
concepts presented in the Relationship Remix
Workshop are, to incoming freshmen, "obvi-
ous and basic about relationships - things
that anyone smart enough to get into the Uni-
versity would already know." As a facilitator
of these workshops I can understand where
Klein is coming from. Sure, it may seem obvi-
ous that trust, communication and consent
are all components of healthy relationships.
Those of us who work in the field of sexual-
ized violence prevention, however, are aware
of the theory-to-practice disconnect present
in discourse on healthy relationships. While
many incoming freshmen - and much of the
general population - are able to assert the
obvious components of healthy relationships,
when 20 to 25 percent of women in college
have experienced a completed or attempted
sexual assault, the disconnect between what
people say they know and how they behave
is obvious.
In order to bridge the theory-to-practice
gap in consent and healthy relationships on
campus, the Relationship Remix Workshop
asks participants to pair up and practice hav-
ing conversations in which giving and receiv-
ing consent is necessary. Klein thought this
experience was "uncomfortable, unrealistic
and purposeless." I completely affirm Klein's
experience of discomfort. However, I believe
the general discomfort in these activities
arises from the fact that we are not taught to
have conversations about sex. In movies, sex
just happens; music plays and things happen
smoothly - there is never a realistic conver-
sation about the expectations of, or feelings
about, the activity.
As facilitators of Relationship Remix, we
expect these conversations to be a bit awk-
ward because we have all been socialized to
remain silent about sex. In response to these
practice conversations being "unrealistic," I
again affirm Klein's feelings - these conver-
sations aren't happening at the frequency we

would like to see. But there lies the point of
the workshop: for people to integrate conver-
sations about consent and healthy relation-
ships into their lives.
It is unfortunate that Klein feels the Uni-
versity is treating all incoming freshmen like
naive children because that is far from what
they are doing. Rather, the University is tak-
ing into account the diverse experiences of
all incoming freshmen. While some people
have learned about consent and sexualized
violence in high school health classes, and
some have been in situations in which they've
been able to give, decline to give, receive or
accept the rejection of consent, these are not
the experiences of all freshmen. There are
many communities that do not approve of
dating, partying or drinking alcohol. There
are some students who have come from fami-
lies and high schools in which interactions
with potential dating partners were limited.
Starting with the basics of healthy relation-
ships, consent and coercion and actually
skill-building around these issues are ways
to educate in a way that is inclusive of all
previous experiences, knowledge levels and
choices of dating partners.
As a final note, I sincerely do not doubt the
maturity level and lack of naivete of Klein
and appreciate very much the attempt to
answer the questions of facilitators during
the workshop. However, in my experience,
some audience members are unable to lis-
ten respectfully when a Relationship Remix
facilitator is speaking, some make offensive
and homophobic remarks and, in Klein's own
words, treat the experience "as a joke or (do)
not do the activit(ies) at all." It is my sincere
hope that freshmen (and all students) rec-
ognize the need to practice healthy behav-
iors rather than just hear about them and
that this recognition will result in attentive,
mature audiences for all future Relationship
Remix Workshops.

Many students who attend the University would like
to become involved in community service, but some-
times it may be difficult to find an organization or
cause in which you can become actively involved and.
actually see the impact of your service from the begin-
ning through the end.
The University's chapter of the Foundation for the
International Medical Relief of Children is a student
organization that helps students become involved in
community service locally and abroad. FIMRC was
started in 2002 to address the health disparities found
in many countries - paying particular attention to the
plight of underserved pediatric groups. The founda-
tion operates through clinic sites to provide high-qual-
ity medical care and preventative education to those
who don't have access to health care.
At the clinic sites, children often come in malnour-
ished or with pneumonia. First, the doctor needs to
prescribe medication to immediately treat the prob-
lem. But the problem is often due to poor hygiene or
parasites, and the patient and the family need to be
educated on how to prevent the problem from occur-
ring in the future.
Since its inception, the national organization has
started self-sustaining clinics around the world and
now has more than 3,000 staff and volunteers who
help carry out their dream of improving the health of
impoverished children around the world.
But what makes FIMRC unique is the importance
of its many college chapters. It's primarily through the
fundraising efforts of college chapters that the inter-
national clinic sites stay open all year.
Something service organizations - like ours - are
often asked is, "Why does FIMRC bother going abroad?
Why don't you focus on helping United States citizens in
need?" Some people may think that we need to honor our
duty to our own country before helping people overseas.
But we believe if we accept arguments like this, we will
be valuing the lives of Americans over those around the
world, and that is undesirable. The value of a person's
life is the same, no matter where he or she was born.
But we don't believe in neglecting our community.
FIMRC strongly believes in having a large local impact.
As volunteer chairs, we can certainly say this is true,
since our role in FIMRC is to find opportunities for

FIMRC members to reach out to the Ann Arbor com-
munity. We hold a variety of events from volunteering
at retirement homes and serving at soup kitchens to
playing games with kids at the Detroit Medical Center.
So how can students get involved in service proj-
ects here and abroad? We'll help find opportunities for
students who join FIMRC to serve in local communi-
ties in a variety of ways. Another hands-on way to get
involved is to travel to one of the clinic sites and volun-
teer. One of our members, student Stephen Philip, went
for a week to Costa Rica to visit the clinic site in the
summer of 2010.
"When you are at the clinic, you can see the health
problems that underserved populations experience
and some of the political and socioeconomic reasons
for those problems," Philip said about his experience.
"The impact on your life will hopefully be profound.
Once you come back from a mission trip, you will be
more willing to educate others about what you have
seen and have a greater passion for fundraising for the
clinics based off your firsthand experiences."
The final way to help out with service projects is
to go to some of the fundraising events FIMRC holds.
We will be holding our largest fundraiser of the school
year, the annual Benefit Dinner, tonight from 5 p.m.-
8 p.m. in the Psych Atrium in East Hall. Restaurants
from all over Ann Arbor donate food to the event for
students and the community to enjoy. There will also
be items up for auction. The admission ticket for the
dinner will get you as much food as you can fit onto
one plate and, more importantly, it will go directly to
improvingthe lives of children around the world. With
this in mind, please come and "spare some change for
change," and get a great meal out of it too!
As students, we need to do everything we can to help
promote a spirit of volunteerism and service. In the end,
it's not a matter of which organization you choose to
work with, but rather the motivation and passion with
which you work. Rather than simply reminiscing about
the great service deeds done by University students in
the past, but use that legacy to propel you to do greater
acts of service in our community and around the world.
Madelyn Stumpos and JordIan Reilly are
the fundraising coordinators for FIMRC.

i program offered through the
University's Nonprofit and Pub-
lic Management Center.
For nine years, the program
has given graduate students
the opportunity to serve as
active members on the boards
of various local nonprofit orga-
nizations, according to Rishi
Moudgil, associate director of
the University's Nonprofit and
Public Management Center. Ini-
tially, the program was only for
students pursuing an MBA in
the Ross School of Business, but
it has since expanded to include
those earning master's degrees
in the School of Social Work and
the Ford School of Public Policy.
According to Moudgil, a stu-
0 dent in the Board Fellows pro-
gram receives a mentor who
guides them during their time on
the board. Students in the pro-
gram can become involved with
anything from financial plan-
ning to working on developing

did for the Salvation Army.
Moudgil said the Board Fel-

graduate students - to immerse
themselves in the community.
"One of the really positive
feedback we get from (the par-
ticipants) is that this is their
opportunity to really engage
with the broader community
and learn about Ann Arbor,
Southeast Michigan, what peo-
ple are doing (in the area) and
have a real experience to apply
their skills," Moudgil said.

forgotten in Big Ten history. The
conference's championship tro-
phy bears his name - not Michi-
gan legend Bo Schembecher's or
former Ohio State coach Woody
Hayes's.
"The Big Ten trophy is the
Stagg-Paterno Trophy, and I
think that says it all in how much
he's given to college football,"
said Michigan senior defensive
captain Mike Martin.
In 1968, Michigan Athletic
Director Don Canham trav-
eled to Pittsburgh to meet with
the hottest young coach in the
nation. He wanted Paterno as
Michigan's next head football
coach.
Paterno, then 42, was com-
ing off an undefeated 11-0 sea-
son at Penn State. He declined
the offer. Canham hired a young
Bo Schembechler from Miami
(Ohio).
"And once a year, Don used
to write me a letter and say,
'Thanks,' " Paterno joked before
the 2009 season.
Schembechler went on to
After students apply for the
fellowship, they are selected for
interviews with the Nonprofit
and Public Management Center
staff and the participating orga-
nizations. The groups then sub-
mit criteria for a candidate, and
the center matches the appli-
cants with the organizations.
This year the program select-
ed 35students from 75 applicants
- the most it has ever received
in one year, Moudgil said. The
fellows have been paired with 22
participating nonprofit organi-
zations and have already started
their work. It is expected that
board members contribute about
eight hours per month to their
positions.
Rackham student Katherine
Valle, who is pursuing her mas-
ter's degree in Public Policy, is
serving as a Board Fellow this
year for Girls on the Run of
Southeastern Michigan, a non-
profit organization that encour-
ages healthy living among
preteen girls through running.
She will create their strategic
plan during her time working
with the organization.
Valle said she is enthusiastic
about her placement. Though
she has yet to attend a formal
board meeting, she has already
been in contact with different
members and has started work-
ing.
"I felt honored to have
received (the fellowship) and
honored to also work for an
organization that I feel like my
personal mission for my life goes
hand in hand with, and I believe
the work that they're doing is
great," Valle said.
Valle, who has already worked
on strategic planning interna-

coach the Wolverines for 21 sea-
sons. Paterno never left Penn
State. Until today.
A legacy built over nearly a
half decade has been decimated
in five days.
Of all the speculations for how
Paterno's legendary tenure in
State College would end, no one
could have scripted this finish.
A week ago this outcome was
unimaginable. It ended as a
unanimous vote.
Paterno had a discussion
with the Board of Trustees over
the phone, signifying the split
between him and the university
in the past two days. A 46-year
bond was severed with a phone
call.
He left on someone else's
terms.
His success on the field is
immeasurable, but his legacy is
marred after a decade-long lapse
in moral judgment.
"Right now, I'm not the
football coach," Paterno said
Wednesday night. "That's some-
thing I have to get used to."
tionally, said she hopes her ser-
vice as a Board Fellow will give
her the chance to leave her mark.
"(The Board Fellowship) for
me will give me an opportunity
to do something with some sort
of an impact in a grander scale
than what I have done, here in
the U.S.," Valle said.
When Jones served as a Board
Fellow, the position was extend-
ed from its original duration of
one academic year, allowing her
to serve during her entire time
at the University. As soon as she
graduated the board offered her
an official position as a board
member, and she has continued
to serve since 2009.
Jones said that while the pro-
gram was difficult, it pushed her
out of her comfort zone, which
helped in her future endeavors.
"If you want to have a great
experience, you have to put in
a lot of time and energy into it,
but it pays off in huge brings
and masses," Jones said. "It was
certainly a lot more work than
I expected in a lot of ways but I
loved every minute of it."
Moudgil said Jones's story is
a model for success within the
program that is still shared at
events for the Board Fellows. As
she has continued to serve as a
board member, Jones said she
learned that many of her past
experiences were helpful in the
work she did on the board with
the Salvation Army division.
"You wear that brand wher-
ever you go as a representative,"
Jones said. "In my case it's the
Salvation Army, and being able
to own that and use those oppor-
tunities you come into in your
day to day interactions can really
benefit the organization."

Researchers
receive $300,000
two-year grant
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
DailyStaffReporter
While logging into Facebook,
Twitter or LinkedIn may seem
as simple as clicking a button,
two University faculty members
suggest there are complex, ener-
gy-intensive processes behind
these mediums for social inter-
action.
Thomas Finholt, professor
of information and senior asso-
ciate dean for faculty in the
School of Information, and Erik
Hofer, lecturer in the School of
Information, recently received
a nearly $300,000 two-year
grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation to research
energy use of social networks.
The networks include online,
cell phone and other mobile
communications.
Finholt and Hofer have been
involved in this area of study for
BILL
From Page 1A
es bullying and offers legal pro-
tection from accountability to
bullies. Despite the opposition,
the bill passed in the state Senate
last week along party lines, with
26 Republicans voting in favor
and 11 Democrats voting against
it. The bill now awaits approval
by the state House of Represen-
tatives.
The legislation, also known
as "Matt's Safe Schools Act,"
was developed in honor of Matt
Epling, a middle school student
from East Lansing who commit-
ted suicide in 2002. In response
to the outcry about the clause,
the state House is currently
rewriting the bill, pledging to
redact the clause from the bill.
Once it is rewritten, itwill return
to the Senate to bridge consensus
among the viewpoints.
According to Ari Adler, press
secretary for Speaker of the
House Jase Bolger (R-Mar-
shall), House Republicans and
Democrats have been collaborat-
ing to produce legislation that
respects students' First Amend-
ment rights and marks bullying
as unacceptable under any cir-
cumstances.
"We want to have a very gen-
eral anti-bullyinglaw that essen-
tially says, 'Bullying is wrong,
and no one should be bullied,"'
Adler said. "It doesn't matter
what reason you think you're
doing it for, and it doesn't matter
who you are."
Though Adler said most
Republicans and Democrats
in both chambers of the Legis-
lature agree on that principle,
negotiations in the House have
been challenging because the
Senate bill was killed and the
contested clause is expected to
be removed.
"You have a situation here
where you are dealing with dif-
ferences of opinion in regards to
the philosophy of whether there
should be a bullying law or not,
and then you wrap into that the
fact that it is a very emotional

issue for many people," Adler
said.
The starkest difference of
opinion is on whether the law
should or should not include a
specific list of characteristics for
which bullying can be punished,
Adler said. He added that he and
Bolger believe such enumera-
tions would only compound the
intricacies of bullying policies,
and Adler expects a list of spe-
cific acts will not be included in
the bill.
"As soon as you start making
a list of reasons that you cannot
bully someone, you're automati-
cally opening the door to a list
of reasons why you could bully
someone," he said. "As soon as
you create a list of inclusions, you

more than 10 years. Their work
has evolved in part due to the
increasing popularity of social
media tools. The goal of their
research is to find ways to make
energy systems more sustain-
able and ultimately help people
manage or reduce their carbon
footprints.
"People maintain their social
networks through a whole host
of supporting infrastructures,
and those all have energy sig-
natures associated with them,"
Finholt said, giving the exam-
ple of a cell phone, which goes
through an energy-intensive
manufacturing and packag-
ing process and uses additional
energy to power its battery and
antenna
Finholt added that he is
concerned about the overcon-
sumption of Earth's fossil fuels,
which are burned to support
many of the processes associ-
ated with socializing.
"We think (social networks)
are a place where some of this
energy consumption is discre-
tionary, and if people knew
what the consequences were,
create a list of exclusions at the
same time."
Still, some lawmakers believe
excluding the enumerations
would weaken the bill's ability
to curb bullying in school. One
proponent, Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-
Ann Arbor), said enumerations
would protect bullied youth
from gaps or lack of specificity in
the policies. Irwin accused state
Republicans in the State House
and Senate of being unwilling to
shield youth like LGBT students,
from harassment.
"(The Senate bill) flies in
the face of what bullying is all
about," Irwin said. "Bullying is
about identifying differences
and picking on them. The Sen-
ate bill says if you can draw some
sort of religious connection to
your discrimination, then it's
OK. That's not going to help the
situation."
State Sen. Rebekah Warren
(D-Ann Arbor) called Repub-
licans' attempt to frame the
enumerations issue as one that
would fail to shield some stu-
dents from harassment a "false
argument." Because the quali-
fication "including, but not lim-
ited to" precedes enumerations
in law, they would encompass
all characteristics for which stu-
dents might be bullied, Warren
said.
"If we make it incredibly
explicit thatwe mean every child
regardless of which of these
characteristics they exhibit or
possess, then we'll have the wid-
est protections possible," she
said.
Though the Senate bill marks
the most significant anti-bully-
ing legislation in the years that
Warren and other lawmakers
have been pushing the issue,
Warren said she might not have
supported it even had the cau-
cus attorney not introduced the
exclusion provision at the last
minute. She criticized the bill's
lack of inclusion of mechanisms
for schools to report their bully-
ing statistics to the state and pro-
viding information legislators
would then use to adjust policy.
"It's such a disappointment

that we would pass a bill that's
so obviously flawed when we're
finally taking a look at it," she
said. "This really is our oppor-
tunity to get something positive
and protective on the books so
that our kids can go to school,
can learn and can get a good edu-
cation without the fear of what
might be waiting for them from
bullies in the classroom."
Jones accused state Demo-
crats of playing the bill for politi-
cal purposes. Neither the clause
nor the legislation as a whole was
intended to excuse bullying or
offer bullies a refuge from liabil-
ity, he said.
"Nothing in this bill says that a
student can go up to another stu-
dent and verbally assault them,"

they might change their pat-
terns of behavior," Finholt said.
For Hofer, the research also
prompts the question of how
much power and energy is truly
required to maintain a friend-
ship. Hofer said he hopes to
better understand the means
by which people network with
one another and develop rela-
tionships, whether it's through
social media such as Facebook
or Twitter, e-mail, cell phone
communication or meeting in
person. Ultimately, this under-
standing could lead to the
creation of more sustainable
technologies to support inter-
personal connections, he said.
Hofer added that the findings
will help answer a broad range
of questions about communica-
tion patterns and how they vary
across different demographics.
"It's a very exciting project ...
It's a chance for us to take a big
step back and look at how all
of these new technologies that
we're using to shape our social
lives are being used in the real
world by people and in what
combinations," Hofer said.
he said. "I don't think that was
the intent at all, and I think the
meaning has been twisted by the
other side of the aisle for politi-
cal purposes."
Jones urged Democratic law-
makers to end their political
wrangling and remember the
reason he introduced the legisla-
tion in the Senate - to mandate
anti-bullying policies and curb
bullying in schools across the
state.
"It's time to stop politics and
start worrying about how we can
have appropriate policies in our
schools to protect our children,"
Jones said.
The bill has also drawn dis-
approval from school district
superintendents statewide.
Superintendents have said they
worry the exception clause will
disarm their abilities to disci-
pline bullies.
Patricia Green, superinten-
dentofAnnArbor Public Schools,
sent a letter to the district's fac-
ulty and staff encouraging them
to write to Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder and state representa-
tives about the Senate bill. Green
wrote in the letter that she found
the exclusion clause "disturbing
and potentially dangerous."
In an interview, Green said
parents wrote to her expressing
their gratitude that she alert-
ed them to the addition of the
clause. She said many parents
wrote to legislators expressing
their disapproval, stating that
the bill did not fully attack bul-
lying.
"It can create potentially dan-
gerous situations for students
to be able to potentially justify
when bullying is allowable," she
said. "We're saying, 'Don't bully,
don't intimidate, don't harass,'
and then you have a situation
where all these exceptions are
allowable and open in some ways
for interpretation."
When informed that Adler
expected the clause would be
excluded from the House's bill,
Green said she was "glad to hear
it."
Ann Arbor Public Schools
already have an anti-bullyingpol-

icy, though Jones said Michigan
is one of three states where such
policies are not state mandated
in public schools. According to
Green, the district's policy clearly
defines bullying and harassment
and outlines measures district
administrators can use to prevent
and punish bullying. But Green
said the state bill, if enacted,
could be a boon to the district's
efforts to limit bullying.
"It means that people are
going to pay much more atten-
tion to that kind of behavior," she
said. "Anything that strength-
ens the effort to eliminate bul-
lying is significant, and I just
want to make sure that we're not
waffling on the issue that kids
shouldn't be bullied."

Shutout ends 'M' season early 84th-minute score
By STEVEN BRAID drops Wolverines

The Michigan men's soccer
team opened the first round of
the conference tournament hop-
ing to resurrect the magic of
2010.
The defending Big Ten Tour-
nament champion Wolverines
were con- _
fident WISCONSIN 2
they could MICHIGAN 0
repeat as
champions, according to fresh-
man midfielder Tyler Arnone.
Despite their struggles dur-
ing the regular season - which
stemmed from their inability to
score - they believed that they
had the ability to surprise every-
one but themselves.
But this wasn't the same high-
octane Wolverine team of 2010,
and it showed.
Struggling to convert on scor-
ing opportunities the whole
game - much like they did dur-
ing the regular season - the Wol-
verines lost to Wisconsin, 2-0, as
their season came to an end.
Early on, the inclement weath-
er greatly impacted play. With
howling winds, cold tempera-
tures and sporadic rainfall, nei-
ther team was able to maintain
possession of the ball for lengthy
periods of time in'the first half.
The winds created havoc for both
defenses.
"The wind in the first half
was a huge factor," said senior
midfielder Adam Shaw. "No one
wanted to take any risks, so we
just wanted to get the ball up the
field. But when we kicked it up
the field, it got stuck in the wind
so it seemed like we were in our
half (of the field) alot."
Despite playing against the
wind during the first half, Michi-
gan (1-5 Big Ten, 5-14-1 overall)
was still able to create scoring
chances. In the 31st minute,
redshirt sophomore midfielder
Noble Sullivan outran the Wis-

consin defense and retrieved
a pass at the top of the box. But
with Badger goalkeeper Max
Jentsch coming out of goal to
challenge the play, Sullivan was
unable to get a clean shot at
the net. Minutes later, Arnone
received a pass in the middle of
Wisconsin's box. With another
golden opportunity, Arnone fired
just left of the goal.
Though both teams had mul-
tiple scoring chances, neither
the Wolverines nor the Badgers
(4-2, 10-7-2) could convert as they
entered halftime in a scoreless tie.
.As the wind died down at the
beginning of the second half,
Wisconsin played much more
aggressively. It attacked relent-
lessly and pressured Michigan's
defense, creating scoring chances
from the first minute of the sec-
ond half. Its attack, though, was
initially stifled by redshirt fresh-
man goalie Adam Grinwis.
Grinwis was instrumental in
keeping Michigan competitive

throughout the game, especially
in the second half when he rou-
tinely made sliding and diving
saves.
In the 58th minute, it looked
as if midfielder Joey Tennyson
would give Wisconsin the lead
with what appeared to be a per-
fectly placed shot at the top left
corner of the goal. But Grinwis
corralled the ball after making a
full-extension save.
"For 84 minutes, Grinwis
managed the game really, really
well," said Michigan coach Steve
Burns. "He made things look easy
in a couple of very dangerous sit-
uations."
The Wolverines, though, con-
tinued to struggle with convert-
ing scoring chances. With less
than 11 minutes left in the game,
junior midfielder Latif Alashe
sent a pass towards Arnone in the
middle of the box. Arnone barely
missed deflecting the ball into
the net, as it sailed just passed his
outstretched leg.

Moments later, Wisconsin
took the lead when midfielder
Nick Janus took a pass from fel-
low midfielder Tomislav Zadro
and knocked the ball into the left
corner of the net from the top of
the box.
Arnone and freshman forward
Matt Rickard had chances to tie
up the game in the 85th minute,
but they couldn't convert their
shots from within the box. With
less than two minutes remaining
in the game, Wisconsin scored its
second goal of the game. Pushing
up the field for additional offense,
Grinwis whiffed on a kick - Wis-
consin took control of the ball
and scored on the empty net.
Despite Michigan's struggles,
Burns was encouraged by what
he saw on the field as his team
enters the offseason.
"All in all, I thought where we
were lacking - with our killing
instinct - the young guys are
starting to come around and they
will be around next year," he said.

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
The Wisconsin men's soccer
team plays its home games on the
banks of Lake Mendota, where
a biting wind sweeps off the
water. So the wind that whipped
through the University of Michi-
gan Soccer Stadium Wednesday
night was nothing new.
The Badgers had just watched
a major upset when Penn State
defeated No. 2 seed Ohio State
earlier in the day. They knew
that in the Big Ten Tournament,
everyone was vulnerable.
Wisconsin also remembered
the Wolverines' remarkable run
through the 2010 Big Ten and
NCAA Tournament that ended
in a heartbreaking 1-0 loss in the
semifinals to Akron. So it knew
that Michigan coach Steve Burns
coaches his teams to thrive in do-
or-die situations.
The Badgers finally broke
through in their 2-0 victory.
The first goal was a rocket from
near the top of the box that red-
shirt freshman goalkeeper Adam
Grinwis couldn't keep from find-
ing nylon. It was clear Wisconsin
knew what it was getting from
the scrappy Wolverines, and
when push came to shove - with
about six minutes remaining in
the match - the Badgers made
sure there would be no fanfare,
no magical run, no last-minute
goals as they defeated Michigan,
2-0.
In fact, it seemed that Wiscon-
sin was prepared for anything
that came its way in Wednesday's
Big Ten Tournament first-round
match - weather, an upset bid or
a hot goalie.
For 84 minutes, Grinwis
played like an All-American goal-
keeper.
Then, he gave up the go-ahead
tally, followed quickly by a whiff

as he was preparing to boot a ball
away. An eager Badger easily fin-
ished on the empty net to put the
match out of reach.
Several times in the first half,
Grinwis needed to fully extend
to prevent Badger shots from
scoring. Wisconsin came into
the game with a more aggressive
style than in the previous meet-
ing and it showed. But Michigan
held on for as long as it could,
waiting for a counterattack strike
that never came.
"They know what we're all
about," Burns said. "The game
played out the way both teams
probably thought it was going to
go. One team was goingto pounce
on the other team's mistake."
And though the southerly
wind was stalwart for the full 90
minutes, that's hardly to say the
momentum followed suit. Both
teams found real estate in the
other's box multiple times in the
first half. But just like in Wiscon-
sin's 2-1 victory over the Wolver-
ines on Oct. 9, possession favored
the Badgers.
"I think they tried to play in
ourhalfalot morethan lasttime,"
said teary-eyed fifth-year senior
midfielder Adam Shaw after the
loss. "We could've done a bet-
ter job of pressing them, which
would've keptthem in theirhalf."
But Wisconsin's combination
of size and speed proved lethal,
even after added time seemed
imminent. And because the first
Wolverine letdown took so long,
when it finally happened, it was
crippling. The wind picked up
even stronger and Shaw and the
rest of the seniors realized their
Michigan careers were ending.
The Badgers' preparation over-
whelmed the Wolverines down
the stretch. But Burns was quick
to point out the team's bright
future, saying his young guys are
"starting to come around."

New faces, old veterans will have Michigan
women's team ready to dance in March

It has been 3,887 days since
the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team last appeared
in the NCAA Tournament.
The current freshmen were
in third grade when the Wolver-
ines lost to
Notre Dame MICHAEL
on March 19, LAURILA

second round. On Women's
Michigan Basketball
was under the
direction of then-coach Sue Gue-
vara.
More than 10 years later, there
are a lot of new faces in Ann
Arbor, but the Wolverines are
looking for similar success.
Instead of Guevara, Kevin
Borseth is the coach hoping to
get Michigan back to the Big
Dance.
Borseth had an immediate
impact when he arrived in 2007,
posting a 16-14 record after five
consecutive losing seasons. Dur-
ing his tenure he has recorded
three winning seasons and
two WNIT appearances, but
no NCAA Tournament appear-
ances.
Two seasons ago he took the
Wolverines to the semifinals of
the WNIT, which was the deep-
est postseason finish in the pro-
gram's history.
But last year, entering the
WNIT as a title contender, they
suffered a devastating first-
round loss to the Eastern Michi-
gan Eagles.
Michigan returns four start-
ers and almost its entire roster
this season. The Wolverines did
lose key contributor Veronica

Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth
was screaming from the sideline,
"Two hands Val, two hands!"
At the other end of the court,
associate head coach Dawn Plit-
zuweit was running the guards
through a pick-and-roll drill, all
while screaming the same thing,
"Two hands, guys, two hands!"
The next moment Driscoll
grabbed the ball, faked up and
went under the high-flying Arnold
for the lay in - all with two hands.
"That's an area of ours that's a
concern," Borseth said. "We've
been working on blocking out and
driving by people, but most impor-
tantly we are looking to go after
the ball with two hands."
While going after the ball with
two hands may seem like far too

basic of a skill to be stressing at
this point in the season, Borseth
knows his team will need to be
strong on all its fundamentals,
even the most basic, if it hopes to
compete against the Gators - who
have their scaly eyes set on anoth-
er 20-win season.
"(Florida's) quick," Borseth
said. "I just got a scouting report
from one of the teams that played
them in the NIT. They put the let-
ters 'qq,'which means quick quick,
by the quick kids, and they got a
bunch of those. They also have
everybodybackfromlastyear, and
they got a big kid in the middle
who's about 6-foot-4. Very typical
of a southeast team, very athletic,
quick."
Playing a team of this caliber,
this early in the season is a dra-
matic change for Michigan whose
first opponents from the last
few seasons included the likes of
Akron, Alcorn State and Ball State.
Borseth refuses to waver on his
decision.
"You got to find out where
you're at at some point whether
it's the first game of the year or
the third," Borseth said. "A lot of
scheduling comes down to look-
ing for teams that can play you

Redshirt junior linebacker Kenny Demens (25) shrugged off a hamstring injury in Michigan's loss to Iowa last Saturday.
Hamstring can't slow
Demens at linebacker

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
It looked like a normal play in
a normal game, when Iowa wide
receiver Keenan Davis caught
the ball on a crossing route
with redshirt junior linebacker
Kenny Demens giving chase on
the Hawkeyes' first drive of the
game. Davis easily pulled away
from Demens for a 44-yard gain.
It was one of just thrge play of 40
or more yards that the Wolverines
defense has allowed this season.
Three hours later, the play was
largely forgotten about due to last-
second drama.
Three days later, it made sense.
Demens wasn't supposed to
be the man to chase him all the
way to the sideline. But defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison .gited
Demens's ability to run as one of
his strengths. He wasn't expected
to run down receivers, but stl, he
got dusted. 19
Tuesday, Maftison reugled the
answer to Demens's lack of burst:
he had played the whole game
with a hamstring injury. Agcord-
ing to Michigan coach Brady
Hoke, Demens had been playing
with the ailment for a while.
"I venture to say there's a lot of
players that would have tapped

The early signing period for
the basketball class "of 2012
began Wednesday, and for the
first time in a while, Michigan
has one of the elite classes in the
nation.
The Wolverines landed a con-
sensus top-10 class in the coun-
try, ranked as high as No. 4 by
Rivals.com and No. 6 by ESPN.
com. Power forward/center
Mitch McGary - who commit-
ted to great fanfare last Thurs-
day - and forward Glenn "Tre"
Robinson III faxed in their
National Letters of Intent to
Michigan on Wednesday. Guard
Nick Stauskas is expected to
send his on Friday.
It's the program's best class
since the 1999 group of LaVell
Blanchard, Jamal Crawford,
Kevin Gaines, Gavin Groninger
and Leland Anderson arrived in
Ann Arbor.
"It's a top-10 class in the
country (to Scout.com), so obvi-
ously that signifies that it's one
of the best around," said Scout.
com recruiting analyst Brian
Snow. "Mitch McGary (is) one
of the premier players. You got
Glenn Robinson, who's one of
the best athletes and someone
who's really on the upswing
with his game, and then also
Nick Stauskas, a big-time shoot-
er.
"You combine all three of
them, it's a heck of a class for
(Michigan coach) John Beilein."
It's the best class Beilein has
landed in his coaching career.
Beilein's never had a reputation
as a great recruiter. Many were
uneasy about his ability to land
top talent when he was named
Michigan's coach in 2007. In
the past, Beilein had signed
more unknown, low-rated
recruits who seemed to fit his
offensive system.
But he did sign Darius Mor-
ris in 2009, who was ranked No.
77 by Rivals.com, and sopho-
more forward Evan Smotrycz in
2010, ranked No. 59. This class
especially breaks the mold and
helps ease the concerns about
Beilein's recruiting ability.
"If someone asked you before
(this class) if they'd be beating
out North Carolina, Duke, Ken-
tucky for kids, you would've

Michigan coach John Beilein received two Letters of Intent on Wednesday and
expects a third on Thursday from Nick Stauskas.

looked at him like he was crazy,"
Snow said. "For me, it's really a
pleasant surprise for Michigan
fans that Beilein is recruiting at
such a high level because he's
proven throughout his head
coaching career that he can 'X'
and 'O' with the best of them,
and he's one of the best in-game
coaches in the country."
The crown jewel of the group
is McGary, a consensus top-5
recruit.
"Mitch possesses a unique
blend of size and skill with
a motor to run, rebound and
compete, which will serve
him well at this level of col-
lege basketball," Beilein said
in a statement. "Mitch loves
the University of Michigan and
loves playing basketball and
will bring energy and enthusi-
asm to our team."
But the other two recruits
are no afterthoughts. Robinson
III - the son of former Purdue
and NBA star Glenn "Big Dog"
Robinson - is ranked No. 34 by
Rivals.com. Like his father, he's
an explosive athlete, but also
has the ability to hit outside
shots. With his ability to finish
above the rim, the 6-foot-6 Rob-
inson could be the Wolverines'
best dunker as soon as he steps
on the court next fall, and Snow
said he's a potential McDon-
ald's All-American.
"The combination of (Rob-
inson's) explosiveness and
unselfishness, along with his

expanding skill set, makes him
a perfect fit for Michigan Bas-
ketball," Beilein said.
Stauskas is more of a tradi-
tional Beilein player, as he's
known as one of the best out-
side shooters in the class of
2012. But the Canadian - who
attends St. Mark's prep school
in Southborough, Mass. -
also is athletic for his 6-foot-5
frame, and can get into the lane.
Snow said that all three can
earn immediate playing time
next year and said McGary
would immediately be Michi-
gan's best player. Stauskas
seems to be a perfect fit for a
role similar to senior guard Stu
Douglass's, and with Robinson
III's explosive athleticism, he
should be an asset off the bench.
Combined, the class of 2012
adds to a Michigan team that
should again be highly ranked
when the three recruits step
onto campus next year.
"You have to say this is an
excellent class for (Michi-
gan)," Snow said. "Michigan
fans, Michigan coaches, (and)
Michigan players all have to be
thrilled with what's coming to
Ann Arbor."
Having already secured four
verbal commitments for 2013,
it appears the Wolverines are
already done recruiting for that
class. That means that Beilein
and his staff can already begin
to concentrate on players in the
class of 2014.

Hopkins embracing new role, Hoke reacts to Paterno situation

BykEiN RAFTERY Oak,Z
Daily SportsEditor games

Trailing Notre Dame, 24-7, at
the start of the fourth quarter,
Stephen Hopkins lined up in
the I-formation behind junior
quarterback Denard Robinson,
as senior running back Michael
Shaw ran in motion. The Wol-
verines needed
half a yard - it NOTEBOOK
was obvious
whom the ball was going to.
Robinson took the snap and
immediately handed it to the
6-foot, 228-pound running back.
Hopkins put his head down and
tried to bulldoze his waythrough
the Fighting Irish defense. But
before he made it back to the line
of scrimmage, the ball was loose.
Somehow, the ball bounced
right back to Robinson, who
dashed left and scampered into
the end zone from two yards out
for the score. Just how the Wol-
verines drew it up, right?
Though Hopkins lucked out
against the Fighting Irish, his
inability to hold onto the ball
helped land him a spot on the
bench.
In just eight carries this sea-
son, he's fumbled twice.
That is, until Michigan coach
Brady Hoke and his staff decided
to use Hopkins in a different role
- as a fullback. k
Hoke and offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges noticed something
in Hopkins they felt *ould fit
perfectly in their system and
would allow them to play Hop-
kins without taking time away
from the other running backs.
"He's a good lead blocker,"
Borges said. "He has tailback-
type skills, so he has good feet,
but he has some toughness."

HOLLOWELL'S REDSHIRT
BURNED: Freshman Delonte
Hollowell, a defensive back
out of Detroit Cass Tech High
School, played in his first career
game last Saturday against
Iowa.
He played on special teams
and recorded his first career
tackle.
Until that point, it appeared
that Hollowell, who weighs just
164 pounds, would redshirt and

work on gaining weight for next
season.
According to Hoke, Hollowell
was just too good in practice not
to play in games.
"He's such a pain in the butt
all week, to be honest," Hoke
said. "On the scout team, how
he competes, doing everything
we ask him to do - he's got very
good quickness. He's athletic,
he's not big, but he's very intel-
ligent.
"We got to a point and we
looked at some depth issues we
felt we had, and it was an oppor-
tunity for him to get five good
games under his belt, and the
experience is going to pay divi-

dends this year."
BARNUM'S BACK?: After
missing Saturday's game against
the Hawkeyes with an ankle
injury, redshirt junior offensive
lineman Ricky Barnum should
be ready to play on Saturday
against the Fighting Illini,
according to Hoke.
"He did some things (in
practice Tuesday)," Hoke said.
"We'll see. He'll play, but we'll
see how healthy he is."
Even if Barnum isn't 100-per-
cent healthy, his presence would
greatly help an already-limited
offensive line - the Wolverines
have just six linemen with expe-
rience.

The City and the Canvas
n What is Ann Arbor's relationship with public art?
by Cassie Balfour, Daily Community Culture Editor

weekend
essentials
Nov. 10 to 13
ON STAGE
"Ain't Misbehavin' " won
an astounding number
of Tony awards in its
original 1978 Broad-
way run. The musical,
an artistic tribute to
the Harlem Renais-
sance and the many
black musicians who
gave it substance, is
opening tonight at Ann
Arbor's Performance
Network Theatre in
a special "pay-what-
you-can" perfor-
mance at 7:30 p.m..

From downtown buildings awash in
spray paint to sculptures erected under
the watchful eye of the City Council,
Ann Arbor is saturated in colors and
ideas. Public art is the pulsating beat
of the troubadours who stake out the Diag
in warm weather. It's the artful bike racks
installed by the city that adorn State Street
and it's the spontaneous poetry scrawled in
Graffiti Alley. Public art is for the people, by
the people.
But that broad definition doesn't really
fit. And the meaning of public art itself is
constantly being redefined, challenged and
debated.
The Ann Arbor government has recognized
the need for public art: The Ann Arbor Pub-
lic Arts Commission (AAPAC) is dedicated
to erecting inoffensive works of public art
throughout the city, in various mediums.
Some small businesses have ordered con-
ventional, city-approved murals to be painted
on the sides of their buildings. Yet other pub-*
lit art is more organic and oftentimes more
subversive - done under the cover of dark-
ness, spray-paint can in hand, with lookouts
watching for city authorities. Cathy Gendron,
a member of AAPAC, even said The Rock that
students have covered in splashes of paint for
years is a form of public art.
Mark Tucker, a lecturer for the Lloyd Hall
Scholars Program and a champion of public
art, sees art everywhere - even on Football
Saturdays.
"The whole atmosphere is a creative rit-
ual, from the costuming to the tailgates to
the intermission show, with amazing ballet-
inspired showmanship and awe-inspiring
physicality on the playing field," Tucker said.
"(It's) not unlike what you would see if you

were to witness what goes into the fabrication
of a heroic piece of sculpture or a grueling
theatrical rehearsal."
Public art is not just about aesthetics - it's
an integral partof life. And according to Tuck-
er, public art reflects our humanity and has an
impact on the shape and
feel of our society.

AAPAC has facilitated quite a few of Ann
Arbor's more visible pieces of public art, includ-
ing the recently revealed bronze sculpture out-
side the Municipal Center. The wall of bronze
is dotted with blue glass pearls that brighten
up when they collect storm water flowing from

FOOD WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
bottle field as Doily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
TOMATO SOUP

PANERA
777 North University Ave.
Panera's tomato soup is pretty tasty
overall. You can tell there are real toma-
toes in it, and it has an enjoyable zesty
flavor. It also comes with croutons, which
is awesome - no less and no more. The
tomato soup at Panera is definitely a solid
choice, rain or shine - plus it only has 300
calories for a large amount of soup. Every-
body wins.
ZINGERMAN'S
422 Detroit St.
Some tomato soups taste like the inside
of a can, but at Zingerman's, the soup
actually tastes like its ingredients. Thick
and textured, it's unabashedly, unasham-
edly tomato. Try to parse out the herbs or
spices in each bite - it's not too difficult.
Best enjoyed with a strong slice of world-
famous Zingerman's bread to dip into it,
this is a tomato soup to return to.

NOODLES
320 South State St.
The tomato soup at Noodles is creamy
and colored a dark, spaghetti-sauce shade
of red. It not only looks like sauce - this
"soup" essentially is. It's very thick, and
you can taste the basil (or some herb). It's
the kind of soup served by Polish grand-
mothers during the colder months, to
instill fortitude against influenza. Also,
it's darn tasty.

Trader Joe's has a deceptive tomato
soup, because the one provided at the
sample counter is infused with some kind.
of smoky spice rub and contains kernels
of crunchy corn at the bottom. But when
you purchase the actual can, hoping to
recreate the melty flavor you tasted in the
store, the result is overly sweet, kind of
bland and overall disappointing.

toire is so damn good.
Not to mention the cast of
"Carnage" is one made of dia-
monds. Picture this: the impec-

("The Reader") paired with the
wolfish grin of Christoph Waltz
("Inglourious Basterds"), and
the straight-laced Jodie Foster
("The Beaver") linking arms
with the furrowed brow of
John C. Reilly ("Cyrus"). Four
heavyweights throwing down
wobbly insults about their chil-

throw-up abound. Delicious.
Yeah, there's always a
chance this thing could fall
through. Maybe all the best
lines in the film have already
been given away in the trail-

doesn't gel. But when there's
a risk involved, there's some-
times a big payoff. And "Car-

PUBLIC ART
From Page 1B
In many ways, AAPAC is lim-
ited by the City Council in what
it can do. Multiple voices are
involved in every step, from brain-
storming to deciding where to put
a piece. City Council Liaison Tony
Derezinski described the slow
process - coming up with an idea
and then waiting for the idea to
meet the city's criteria of "careful,
and very prudent" before being
unveiled.
The reactions to the Percent
for Public Art program have been
mixed. AnnArbor.com posted
an article in September 2011 that
quoted various council members
criticizing the program for only
creating two art pieces in four
years. Some members even ques-
tioned the value of the Percent
Program. A number of random
commenters echoed similar senti-
ments, bemoaning the uselessness
of public art.
Tucker believes public funding
for artis just as important as fund-
ing for other societal services.
"Why don't we recognize that
artists are as important to the
fabric of our community as any
firefighter, police, teacher or con-
struction worker?" Tucker said.
"My guess is that each of us has at
one time or another been deeply
moved by a poem, a theatrical
performance or perhaps an amaz-
ing concert. Why do we always
take this for granted? Is it simply
because we don't understand the
time, expense, talent, education
and dedication required to bring a
piece of artwork to life?"
Tucker has claimed a vote for
" public art is a vote for all arts, and
that it shouldn't be viewed as an
extra expense. It is a necessary
"cultural value" that we as a town
have deemed important enough
to invest in. He added that Ann
Arbor as a whole must value art
and that a few anonymous com-
mentators do not represent the
voice of the entire city.
Tucker also said that a city that
values art as much as Ann Arbor
does shouldn't censor, but instead
value, all kinds of creative expres-
sion.
"To (censor art) is to cut off our
own heads," he said.
Derezinski also works to com-
batthe manyrulesgoverningwhat
public art pieces can be created.
He recognizes the pull public art
can have on creating economic
prosperity for Ann Arbor and to
retain the city's youth population.
"We have to find other funds
to keep the homeless in warm
places and other very needy proj-
ects, but the art money is a trying
thing in tough times," Derezinski
said. "Here you really are defin-
ing what you are and we can't
give up our core nature of being
both a compassionate city but
also a city that has a strong devo-
tion to the arts. I think those
restrictions were wisely put in so
we wouldn't diminish our efforts
given the twists and turns of the
economy."
But it doesn't have to be a zero-

sum game, in which the commu-
nity's decision to create public
artwork will cause other aspects
of city governance to suffer.
"It's more helpful to take a
long-term look at public art," Gen-
dron said. "Look at the parks - it

It isn't clear what graffiti
counts as art. Shades himself

against detractors.

they want be down, and it's slow-
ly, surely coming around," Shades
said. "But it's a college town, they
want to keep it clean, pristine for
you guys. You can try to knock on
their door and if they let you in,
just tag the bathroom and get the
fuck out."
Tucker values all art, even if
he doesn't like all art equally. He
founded the annual spectacle
known as Festifools. Each spring,
Main Street becomes crowded
with giant puppets made by stu-
dents with help from community
members. Though the artwork is
temporary and shifts each year,
Tucker said the march of pup-
pets is still public art - despite
its apparent impermanence, the
event's annual nature makes it
permanent public art.
Maybe defining public art is
dangerous. Tucker said that once
we start deciding what counts as
art, we risk stifling a vital com-
ponent in our society. But if Ann
Arbor is to solidify its reputation
as a creative community, it has to
be open to discourse on how to
integrate public art into the city,
whatever "public art" may be.

Whatever grows goes,

Now, it SMITH-
may just EPPSTEINER
be seen as
something to
do, something to talk about and
something to crazy party about
at the end of the month, but like
the majority of trends, thereis
a story behind the madness. No
Shave November, also referred
to as Movember and Novem-
beard, was an event conceived
by a group of Australians in
1999. Five years later, Movember
Charity was established to raise
awareness for prostate cancer.
Men register online, pledging
their commitment to the public
men's health campaign by shav-
ing Oct. 31 and growing out and
grooming a mustache through-
out the month of November,
typically ending the joke with a
Dec. 1 shave. I feel more in-the-
know now that I'm aware of the
cause behind the hair, which is
sponsored by Livestrong and
sports the catchphrase, "Every
mustache makes a difference."
I would venture to guess that
the fusion between the charity's
cause and the trend works out
delightfully for men because
they come off as both caring
and manly, the ultimate con-
trast. Naturally, all one needs
to paint the perfect picture isnto
have a Golden Retriever pacing
by his side.
But this fad extends much
further than the campaign, to
college students and others.
Many participate in the intended
facial hair growth without
knowing about the campaign
behind the fun.
Personally, I'm all for the
crazes of November - cozy
sweaters, pumpkin cheesecake
and sexy beards - yes, please.
But I know that's not the case for
everyone.
There are a wide variety of
female responses to this fall
movement: In the extreme, we
have females in cheerleader sup-
port of their Movember men,
also known as Mo Sistas. There
are women, like me, who find
the scruffy look to be intriguing
and pleasing. And then there are
the many ladies who like their
men clean-shaven. Those with
participatingboyfriends, but
who are not in favor of such a
brutish style, simply refer to the

month as "No Sex November."
But the ratio of people con-
tent with the trend running its
course shifts dramatically when
it's women partaking in the fes-
tivities.
According to my Twitter-
based research, there exists
a massive group of men and
women who think it's over-the-
top-feminist and also simply
disgusting for chicks to let their
leg and armpit hair flow natu-
rally. The fact that men don't
support this impulse doesn't
make much sense to me because,
by extension, it's like they're
not supporting women who
support men. And the timeless
argument of my-body-not-yours
stands in this scenario, as well.
If you have abig problem with
the four-week movement, date a
swimmer, date a supermodel or
embrace the hair.
No shave,
no shame
November.
One of the less crude Movem-
ber-related, misogynistic tweets:
"That awkward moment when
you have to explain that No
Shave November is meant for
men, NOT women." But it's good
to know there is a slight balanc-
ing out happeningbecause of
tweets like, "I guess as part of
No Shave November I should
point out that ladies with body/
facial hair are totally, utterly glo-
rious. Rock on, lovelies."
However you look at it, it's a
social force you will encounter
in some way or another. If you
don't enjoy your colleagues let-
ting loose, you might still be one
of the many enjoying the mer-
chandise that results from it -
mustache mugs or stickers have
been popping up everywhere.
Ann Arbor has more beards
than mustaches, and I appreci-
ate that. Everyone should con-
tinue trimming, waxing, styling
and shaving - or not - as they
wish, and should welcome each
individual to do the same. It's
a fashionably cold but carnal
month for those participating
in No Shave November. But it
could be larger than that for
altruists - this particular trend
may have more longevity and
appeal than others like Insta-
gram, Ray Bans and the phrase
"Is this real life?" because of
the consciousness of a health
campaign beneath your swank
wool coat.

Derezinski said. "There was a
Supreme Court justice that once
said about obscenity, 'I can't

latitude. Some of the spontane-

Self-proclaimed "graff artist"
Shades claims graffiti art will
always have a stigma attached to
it, but when he was growing up,
street art had nothing to do with
reckless vandalism. Shades's work
these days is still graff art, but
now people hang it above their
mantelpieces rather than just see-
ing it in the streets. First, someone
was moved by it, and then Shades
was able to make himself into a
successful artist. From his begin-

Walking into Hollander's, a bookbind-
ing store nestled in historic Kerrytown,
one is instantly overwhelmed by the
sheer volume of paper hanging in wooden
racks, row after row. Simple solids are
juxtaposed next to splashes of shimmer-
ing metallic and intricate patterns. Every
sheet radiates a vivid signature, bearing
that raw, rustic appeal of the handcrafted.
That same appeal permeates through-
out the shop, each nook and cranny filled
to brimming, from the wall of bookbind-
ing supplies, to the racks of stationery, to
the squeak of aged hardwood underfoot.
Cocooned under the gleam of soft light-
ing, Hollander's is one lasting example
of the rare places still catering to such a
niche market. It is one of the few remain-
ing stores to offer a hands-on approach
to such time-honored traditions as hand-
made papermaking and bookbinding.
Book arts is devoted to perceiving the
book as an art object. For purveyors of the
craft, the form and touch of a hardcover
tome is just as important as the content
inside.
Hollander's has become nationally rec-
ognized for its vast selection and exclu-
sive workshops devoted to the art of the
book. Through the workshops, which
are conducted in the basement of the
store, students learn and create beautiful
pieces of history, surrounded by old-fash-
ioned printing presses and other equally
enthused pupils of book arts practices.
Covering an immense array of subjects,
and with names from Foundational Cal-
ligraphy to Japanese Books and Boxes,
the workshops offer a distinctive setting
for acquiring these atypical and uncon-
ventional crafts. Generally spanning one

or two days, the workshops cater to both
novices and experts, offering a one-on-
one setting with the instructor. These
instructors come from all over the coun-
try. Even nationally recognized pioneers
of the burgeoning modern book arts
movement, most notably Hedi Kyle, have
traveled to Ann Arbor to teach at Holland-
er's, according to owner Cindy Hollander.
Eric Alstrom, instructor of the Japa-
nese Books and Boxes class, has been
teaching at Hollander's for seven years.
Alstrom is also the head of the Florence
G. Wallace Conservation Laboratory at
Michigan State University, where he is
currently working with other book arts
faculty to create a definitive book arts
program.
"There's just something about the feel
of a book, being able to hold that and read
it versus seeing it on a screen," Alstrom
said, elucidating on the importance of
keeping these papermaking and book-
binding of traditions in practice in mod-
ern society.
There is certainly an exotic charm to
the handmade journals that the students
create in this class, with their beautifully
vibrant covers and exposed stitching.
These distinctive creations are part of
what is keeping the book arts movement
alive today, exemplifying the inherent
contrast between what can be digitally
appealing and what is alluring - not only
in appearance, but also assembly.
"I think that people always like to make
things, to work with their hands," owner
Tom Hollander explained, as an illustra-
tion of how Hollander's has remained
such a steady force in Ann Arbor. "There
is a part of the population that just really
wants to be involved with making some-
thing from scratch, making something by
hand and making it visually interesting.
Not just functional, you know, but beauti-
ful and interestingto look at."
The Hollander's workshops have
helped to shape what the store has become
today. Since opening its doors in 1991, the
family-run shop has steadily grown with

each passing year, becoming one of the
largest providers of decorative papers and
bookbinding supplies in the country. It
even ships internationally to customers in
places as far as Argentina and Japan.
Though Hollander's currently resides
on the ground floor of the historic Ker-
rytown Market and Shops, the store did
not always have such permanent lodg-
ings: It began not ina retail space, but in
the free-flowing venue of the Ann Arbor
Art Fairs. Tom and Cindy Hollander used
to work out of their home, creating desk
accessories from the same decorative
paper prevalent in the shop today, and
then selling these creations in various
art fairs.
"It just got to the point where we
thought, 'Boy, it would be nice -tohave
someplace where we could keep it all set
up.' And there was just a real small space
in Kerrytown and we thought we could
give it a try," said Cindy, who worked in a
corporate job for 10 years before opening
the shop. "We thought we could do it, and
it just kind of grew from there."
Of course, the Hollanders weren't ini-
tially certain of the venture. With no
direct knowledge of the burgeoning book
arts community already established here
in Ann Arbor, their decision was a veri-
table stab in the dark. Fortunately, they
were in the right place at the right time,
and Hollander's continued to grow steadi-
ly as the years passed.
There will always be the passion to
create, whether from paper or from pix-
els, and as long as such passion endures,
Hollander's will continue to offer a place
to facilitate the exploration of such cre-
ativity. With the continuing emergence
of a book arts community in Ann Arbor,
Hollander's is sure to always have a demo-
graphic to cater to.
"Book art, you know, (in the past) you
would say it to somebody and they would
have no idea what you're talking about,"
Cindy Hollander said. "But it has come
into its own being, so we were just ahead
of the curve, fortunately."

THE VAU LTICINEMA PARADISO' (1988), MIRAMAX
Finding paradise in the cinematic treasures of old

By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
If a film succeeds, its audience will
simply set aside all logic. For a couple of
hours, we won't see actors or contrived
special effects. We won't hear music.
Though we're only watching people
pretending to be other people, we'll feel
something greater than we can under-
stand.
For some, this is irrelevant, which is
fine - they come to be entertained for
a couple of hours and they are. But for
others, films provide a form of escapist
catharsis. And the Italian film classic
"Cinema Paradiso" succeeds by not only
helping to explain this phenomenon,
but also by providing its own helping
of emotional payoff. This makes its elo-
quent storytelling reach far beyond its
financial success.
Today, 22 years later, "Cinema Para-
diso" is consistently ranked as one of
the best films of world cinema, and it's
often credited as one of the reasons
behind the Italian film industry's reviv-

al. Grossing an impressive amount at the
box office, the film won the Special Jury
Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival
and the Best Foreign Film Oscar at the
1989 Academy Awards. Surprisingly,
all this is owed to Miramax co-founder
(and infamous film butcher) Harvey
Weinstein.
The 1988 gem
'Cinema Paradiso'
is more than a
collection of kisses.
After the original cut was criticized
as bloated and scatter-brained, the
stewardship of its international release
was handed over to Weinstein, where
51 minutes were cut. Under Weinstein's
scalpel, Tornatore's poignant story of
film director Salvatore Di Vita (Jacques

Perrin, "Le Petit Lieutenant") and his
early life as a mischievous movie-lover
nicknamed "Toto" (Salvatore Cascio,
"The Pope Must Die") are even more
keenly felt.
Toto is a young boy living in an iso-
lated Sicilian town where he dreams
of people and places that are impossi-
bly beyond his reach. But through the
power of film, he can experience worlds
through the eye of a camera. Movies
offer Toto - and other inhabitants of his
town - an escape.
When this escape has to be censored
by the local priest for material he finds
sexually offensive, it's easy to under-
stand the town's feelings of frustra-
tion. Hotvever, these bits and pieces of
the film are snipped off and put away
in a box by the cinema operator Alfre-
do (Philippe Noiret, "Topaz"), who
becomes Toto's mentor.
After Alfredo's funeral, Toto, now a
broken man burdenedby his ownmemo-
ries, is given a small montage left to him
by his mentor. It's a collection of all the
kiss scenes the priest had censored, and

what follows is truly a perfect scene.
As the screen flickers on, an eloquent
score by Ennio Morricone builds in the
dark. The camera pans to Toto's face.
As the screen illuminates with dozens
of famous Hollywood kisses, a range
of emotions plays over his face. This
scene alone sums up the nostalgia, pain,
regret, joy and heartbreak that he's car-
ried for more than 30 years. Like Toto,
we are overwhelmed by its power. But
when the montage ends three minutes
later, the weight of Toto's memories
is lifted, and we stand up fresh and
renewed.
It's puzzling to consider how power-
ful this scene is. Rationally, we'd remind
ourselves that none of this actually hap-
pened anyway - after all, it's just a scat-
tered montage of famous Hollywood
kisses. Still, our tears are unmistakably
mixed with the same joy Toto feels. Its
meaning isn't given weight through its
own merit, but through the experiences
that we bring with us.
Movies give us a chance to compact
and project our past on screen. In only

a single scene, "Cinema Paradiso" dem-
onstrates and explains the redemptive
power of storytelling. It's a tremendous
achievement that will remain relevant
so long as laughs, tears and thrills are
shared in a movie theater.
