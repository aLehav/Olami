Michigan Medicine nurses at high 

risk of contracting the virus have 

had different experiences navigating 

the risk of caring for patients versus 

returning to work. 

Michigan 
Medicine 
began 

conducting 
in-house 
COVID-19 

testing for employees and patients on 

March 19 and has created a COVID-19 

hotline for employees and patients as 

well as curbside screening by referral. 

Meghan Clarke, a nurse at C.S. 

Mott Children’s on the Respiratory 

Intensive Care Unit, was among the 

first nurses to volunteer to work in 

the converted COVID-19 units. She 

said the level of personal protective 

equipment and other protections 

provided was especially high. 

“The RICU where everyone was 

going at first was really the most 

protected I’ve heard of in any of the 

health care systems so far,” Clarke said. 

“All the rooms have negative pressure, 

so what that means is the air from that 

room is being vacuumed back into the 

room, it’s not being blown out into the 

hallway. We had either an N95 face 

mask that we had to be fitted for or a 

(powered air-purifying respirator). If 

you had the PAPR, that covered your 

whole head and face, but if you were 

wearing an N95, they were giving you 

eye shields too.”

When Clarke began experiencing 

symptoms after about a week of 

working in the COVID-19 unit, she 

said they were mild and could easily be 

written off.

“If I hadn’t been very aware of the 

situation and trying to read up as much 

as I could, they were symptoms that 

would have been very easy to ignore 

or attribute to another cause,” Clarke 

said. 

Clarke has since tested positive for 

COVID-19. 

She said all Michigan Medicine 

employees 
must 
go 
through 

occupational health services. 

“We’re told at Michigan Medicine 

that if we have any questions, any 

symptoms, basically direct everything 

to our occupational health department, 

so they were the first people that I 

called,” Clarke said.

ANN ARBOR

As the spread of the novel 

coronavirus forces businesses 

across the state to shut down 

and residents to shelter in 

place, 
many 
people 
have 

been laid off, leaving them 

struggling to pay rent and 

other bills.

LSA 
senior 
Emily 
Roat 

lives in an Oxford Companies 

property. She lost her job and 

needed assistance paying her 

$420 per month rent.

Subletting difficult amid virus outbreak

Filling empty apartments, houses during summer months complicated by COVID-19 

In response to the continued 

spread of the coronavirus and 

uncertainty 
over 
when 
the 

pandemic may be controlled, the 

University of Michigan moved all 

classes for the spring and summer 

terms to remote learning. For 

Ann Arbor landlords and tenants, 

the University’s decision means 

significantly 
fewer 
students 

looking 
to 
sublet 
properties 

during the summer months. 

Many 
students 
leave 
Ann 

Arbor and return home to live 

with their families or move 

elsewhere for internships over 

the 
summer. 
Because 
rental 

properties in Ann Arbor are 

typically leased on 12-month 

contracts, they are stuck paying 

rent for unused houses and 

apartments. 
To 
mitigate 
the 

financial burden of paying for an 

empty property, tenants look to 

sublet their properties to the few 

students who remain for spring 

and summer classes.

This 
year, 
however, 
those 

subletters may be hard to find. 

The University’s move to online 

courses for spring and summer 

effectively eliminates the need 

for 
the 
remaining 
enrolled 

students to be in Ann Arbor, 

shrinking the pool of people 

looking to sublet housing.

Rackham student Kamerhon 

Moses is a resident in the Vic 

Village 
apartment 
building. 

When the building announced 

that one of their residents had 

tested positive for COVID-19, 

Moses said he chose to leave. 

“I decided it was probably best 

to just get out of there because, 

one, I have insurance that’s 

only for my state, so if I get sick, 

I’m kind of screwed if I’m in 

Michigan,” he said. “You never 

really take it too seriously until 

it starts affecting people around 

you, and once I heard somebody 

in the building was the second 

or third case in all of Michigan, I 

was like, ‘Wow, this is spreading 

fast and it’s probably not going to 

be great if I or anyone around me 

in my apartment gets sick.’”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a 

state of disaster Wednesday night and 

signed an executive order expanding 

Michigan’s 
COVID-19 
response. 

Whitmer previously declared a state 

of emergency on March 10 in hopes of 

helping local governments slow the 

spread of COVID-19 and persuading 

Michiganders to take preventative 

measures. 

In a press release Wednesday, 

Whitmer said the state of disaster 

order would allow for a more 

effective response and hopes it 

will help reduce the impact of the 

coronavirus in Michigan. 

“Today’s action will allow my 

administration 
to 
respond 
more 

effectively to every facet of this 

crisis,” Whitmer said. “During this 

time, it’s crucial that Michiganders 

continue to stay home and keep their 

distance from others. We will get 

through this together.” 

As of Wednesday, Michigan had 

7,630 recorded cases of COVID-19 

and 264 deaths, as Wayne County 

has quickly become an epicenter of 

the disease. Michigan has the fourth 

most cases of any state, behind New 

York, New Jersey and California. 

Washtenaw County had reported 400 

cases of COVID-19 and eight deaths.

In the press release, Joneigh 

Khaldun, chief deputy for health and 

chief medical executive of Michigan 

Department of Health and Human 

Services, explained she believed the 

executive order will help protect 

Michiganders and hopes it will slow 

the spread of COVID-19. 

“The 
number 
of 
confirmed 

COVID-19 cases in Michigan is still 

climbing, and we must continue to 

do everything we can to slow the 

spread,” Khaldun said. “The governor 

has taken a number of critical steps to 

protect Michigan families, and this 

order today will allow that work to 

continue. I will keep working closely 

with the governor and our partners 

across state government to mitigate 

the spread of COVID-19.” 

Whitmer has previously ordered 

non-essential businesses to close and 

directed all Michiganders to stay in 

their homes with few exceptions. 

The Centers for Disease Control 

and Prevention recommends people 

wash their hands often and avoid 

touching their faces. Anyone who 

believes they have been exposed to 

COVID-19 should call their primary 

care physician or reach out to the 

local health department, which in 

Washtenaw County can be reached at 

734-544-6700.

Whitmer declares state of

Governor takes action to expand Michigan’s efforts to combat 
spread of COVID-19 as global pandemic takes its toll on residents

“They were the people who did the 

screening with me, going over all my 

symptoms, and they asked me about more 

symptoms than just the basic three.”

Clarke said she had to strongly advocate 

for testing because she did not necessarily 

meet the typical requirements of fever, 

dry cough and shortness of breath. 

“A lot of places, because of the limited 

supply of testing, are only testing people 

who really meet the criteria, so I made it 

really clear that one, I work on RICU so 

I know I’m working with people that are 

positive and there’s the risk of exposure,” 

Clarke said. “But two, even though I 

didn’t have a fever on reading, I had other 

symptoms of fever-like sweats and chills. 

I feel like I really had to advocate strongly 

for myself, I don’t meet the obvious 

criteria, but I recognize changes in myself 

that I think are similar.”

Clarke said she had heard about 

her coworkers experiencing similar 

symptoms and being denied testing.

“I don’t know if it’s the luck of who you 

talk to or how strongly you advocate for 

yourself or if they called a week before I 

did when those symptoms weren’t being 

considered, but now they are,” Clarke 

said. “ … I just know that I really tried 

to make a strong case for getting myself 

tested.” 

Another registered nurse interviewed 

for this article has requested to remain 

anonymous for fear of jeopardizing their 

job at Michigan Medicine. 

The registered nurse, who works 

in an Intensive Care Unit at Michigan 

Medicine’s main hospital, will be referred 

to as Nurse 1. They said they were exposed 

to a patient with COVID-19.

“We had a surgical patient that had 

been on our floor for a couple days, 

we were trying to figure out why we 

couldn’t get him extubated and off of 

the ventilator,” Nurse 1 said. “I was in 

there working with him without a mask 

because at that point he was just a typical 

surgical patient.”

When it was determined that the 

patient had COVID-19, health care 

professionals considered to be at risk 

were notified immediately that they had 

likely been exposed to the virus. These 

“exposures” include staff present in the 

room when certain procedures were 

performed on COVID-19 patients while 

not wearing proper equipment, such as 

adequate masks and eye protection.

“I came back to work two nights later, 

he had been reintubated, swabbed for 

corona and was not doing well,” Nurse 

1 said. “By Saturday, I woke up after my 

shift and I had gotten these emails from 

my boss … missed calls all saying ‘The 

patient came back positive. Because you 

were taking care of him on these days 

when he wasn’t on droplet precautions 

and he was extubated, it’s considered to 

be a high-risk exposure.’”

The email from Infection Prevention 

and Epidemiology, sent out to employees 

considered to be high risk, notified nurses 

and other health care professionals that 

they may have been exposed to the virus. 

The email detailed exposure criteria and 

noted that an employee determined to 

have a high-risk exposure to the virus 

will be restricted from coming into work 

for 14 days.

Roat said after reaching out to 

Oxford Companies, she was told they 

were not planning on providing rent 

assistance.

“Essentially they said that they 

were a management company and the 

individual property owner of 425 Hill 

had chosen not to make any changes 

whatsoever.,” Roat wrote. “The person 

who emailed me recommended I apply 

for unemployment, and said I should 

consider subletting — I still live there, 

so that is not an option, and moving in 

with my parents would be dangerous 

for them.”

On 
March 
23, 
Roat 
posted 

screenshots of her emails and text 

messages with Oxford Companies 

in a Facebook group with University 

students. Roat said in addition to 

declining to offer rent relief, Oxford 

Companies had no plans to allow 

tenants to break leases early. 

Oxford Companies owns several 

apartment complexes and houses 

in the Ann Arbor area. On behalf of 

Oxford Companies, Karin Meier, 

director of Shared Services, shared a 

statement with The Daily. Meier said 

the company is aware of the difficulties 

their tenants are facing and said they 

will be waiving all late fees for their 

residents.

“The COVID-19 outbreak and the 

actions necessary to slow its spread 

are creating hardships for everyone,” 

Meier wrote. “At Oxford, our first 

priority will always be the safety and 

wellbeing of our residents. To that 

end, our maintenance staff is taking 

strong 
precautions 
and 
adhering 

to the protocols of the CDC and 

Health Department as we service the 

properties to ensure resident safety.” 

Meier wrote that the company is 

looking for ways to lessen the burden 

on their residents, but is unable to 

construct a universal policy for all its 

properties. 

“While 
we 
don’t 
own 
any 

residential assets, Oxford provides 

property management services on 

behalf of multiple property owners, 

each with their own unique financial 

considerations such as property taxes 

and 
mortgage 
payments,” 
Meier 

wrote. “As such, we unfortunately 

aren’t able to offer a uniform policy 

regarding rent payments. What we can 

do, however, is continue the discussion 

around COVID-19 to understand how 

residents, property owners, lenders 

and the City of Ann Arbor are impacted 

and identify possible solutions.”

In response to those in search of 

rent relief, University alum Hoai An 

Pham created a Facebook page for 

Washtenaw County Mutual Aid + 

Resources to support tenants who 

need assistance paying rent during 

COVID-19. 

She said she created the page 

because she feels it is important to 

ensure people have access to as much 

information as possible.

“I saw lots of other Facebook groups 

being created around the country, and 

a lot of us have been learning from each 

other and communicating with each 

other. I think that’s really important to 

be collaborating and sharing resources 

when we can,” Pham said. “I was 

seeing a lot of people just trying to 

share as much as they could on their 

own Facebook pages in the hopes that 

people would see it, and there were, 

like, 20 different research documents 

being circulated.

Washtenaw Mutual Aid has been 

in existence for over a year, but Pham 

said she thought it was important for 

everyone to have access to any and all 

resources they may need in this time of 

uncertainty. 

“The Mutual Aid Network facility 

has existed for a year, in part connected 

to the Mutual Aid Disaster Relief 

organization, which has existed for a 

super long time,” Pham said. “Peace 

House, in Ypsi, is a house of hospitality 

and has been doing work for homeless 

folks for a super long time. Detroit 

has been doing all the groundwater 

delivery to folks who don’t have 

running water. So, all this stuff existed 

before. I think that in these times, 

there has been a higher need in terms 

of mutual aid because a lot of people 

are losing their jobs.” 

LSA seniors Sharif Krabti and 

Katrina 
Stalcup 
and 
Rackham 

student Casey Jong are working on a 

campaign called No Rent Michigan. 

The campaign aims to help renters 

receive support and guidance during 

the COVID-19 pandemic. Krabti said 

their short-term goals are to empower 

tenants.

“We took the approach of getting 

resources out there as much as possible 

to allow people to organize for their 

own situations, and hopefully get some 

concessions or get some relief for this 

month’s rent or for April’s rent,” Krabti 

said. “And then our long-term goal is 

trying to build a network of tenants 

across the state of Michigan. 

Stalcup said Ann Arbor renters 

should not strike by themselves. She 

advised renters struggling to pay rent 

to look at the organization’s resource 

guide for advice on how to approach 

asking for a rent waiver for April.

“(Striking by themselves) puts 

them at risk,” Stalcup said. “Really 

consider our Google Doc and our list 

of resources that shows you how you 

can create a network within your own 

building, and then also long-term, 

be connected to a statewide group of 

people that are supporting renters 

standing in solidarity with renters and 

will continue to show up.”

Moses 
moved 
out 
of 
his 

apartment and returned home, 

but he still has to pay rent on 

his Vic Village apartment. He 

said he posted a listing for his 

apartment in several Facebook 

groups and utilized Vic Village’s 

sublet-assistance system but has 

yet to find someone to sublet his 

apartment. 

“It 
hasn’t 
happened 
yet,” 

Moses said. “But I’m still holding 

on to hope because rent is pretty 

expensive.”

Moses attributed some of that 

trouble of finding a subletter to 

there being so few students left 

in Ann Arbor. 

“It’s pretty hard to find a 

subletter 
when 
everybody’s 

leaving,” Moses said. “A lot of 

people kind of got — for a lack 

of a better word — screwed, 

because some people just don’t 

have resources. I’m definitely 

one of the lucky ones where I am 

able to at least go back and have 

someplace here, but it’s definitely 

affected the market.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Harrison 

George said he is also struggling 

to sublet his apartment for the 

summer. 

“I have it through the summer, 

and I was planning on subleasing 

it,” George said. “I had a lot of 

interest from people before all 

of this happened, and then once 

they announced online classes, 

interest started to decline for 

everyone. All my friends who I 

know who have housing right now 

are amazed at how drastically 

quick people were interested in it 

and then just kind of faded away.”

While people had expressed 

interest 
in 
subletting 
his 

apartment, George said it is 

usually hard to sublet even 

without 
the 
effects 
of 
the 

coronavirus. 

“Ann Arbor is a ghost town in 

the summer,” he said. “The only 

time you’re going to get someone 

to sublease is usually for spring 

term. And then July and August 

are just sunk costs. Like, you are 

not going to get anyone. That’s 

usually, in my experience, how 

it’s gone.”

Most 
University 
students 

are only enrolled in classes 

from 
September 
to 
April. 

During the 2018-2019 school 

year, enrollment dropped from 

around 45,000 students during 

the fall and winter semesters to 

an average of a little less than 

4,000 students over spring and 

summer.

Students 
also 
expressed 

concerns 
about 
the 
greater 

effects of the pandemic going 

into the summer. Last week, 

Michigan 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer issued an executive 

order directing all non-essential 

businesses to shut down to slow 

the spread of the virus. However, 

with no clear end in sight, many 

are 
worried 
the 
restrictions 

could last much longer. 

George said he thinks the 

stay-at-home order was the right 

call but is concerned about the 

economic effects. 

“The stay-at-home order is 

going to make it even worse now 

because people are going to now 

move out of Ann Arbor even 

more,” George said. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Trenten 

Ingell helped create a petition to 

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor calling for the halting 

of all rent payments in light of 

the coronavirus outbreak. As of 

Wednesday night, the petition 

had more than 2,800 signatures.

“We wanted to represent both 

on- 
and 
off-campus 
housing 

situations and the issues that a lot 

of people are having with where 

they are living,” Ingell said of the 

petition. “Some people want to 

leave, and they still have to pay 

rent. We thought that was kind 

of — pardon my language, but — 

bullshit. In the dorms, people 

were being de facto evicted. 

They did not want it to look like 

an eviction but, I mean, it really 

was.” 

Ingell lived in North Quad 

Residence Hall this year but 

moved out when the University 

made the decision to consolidate 

on-campus housing. Ingell said he 

recognized the difficulty of the 

University’s situation but said he 

feels the $1,200 reimbursement 

that the school is offering its 

residents is not enough. 

“We ran through some of 

the numbers,” Ingell said. “We 

should really be paying, and get 

paid back, a little more than 

$3,000 just with our meal plan 

and housing based on the time 

that we would not be living in the 

dorms or taking advantage of the 

meal plan.”

On March 27, the University 

announced that students will 

receive dining credits for their 

unused meals and Dining Dollars 

that can be used when classes 

resume in-person instruction. 

There 
remains 
a 
lot 
of 

uncertainty 
about 
what 
this 

summer holds for tenants in 

Ann Arbor. But amid all of the 

adjustments — returning home, 

adjusting 
to 
online 
classes, 

struggling to find a subletter — 

students said they feel like they 

need to remain positive. Moses 

said he appreciates the resources 

he has and is looking out for those 

who have less. He also said he is 

trying to prioritize productivity, 

noting that an outbreak of the 

plague sent Isaac Newton home 

from university in the 1660s. 

While in quarantine, Newton 

developed 
groundbreaking 

theories 
and 
mathematical 

concepts.

“He went home, and we all 

know about Newton now because 

of that summer,” Moses said. 

“Everybody 
should 
just 
stay 

productive and try to think about 

other people.”

On March 23, two days after Nurse 

1 was told to avoid work for two weeks, 

all Michigan Medicine employees 

received an email instructing health 

care professionals that had previously 

been identified as having had a high-

risk exposure to return to work if they 

do not present any symptoms.

“As 
a 
result 
of 
widespread 

community transmission, the state 

has issued new information today 

stating that healthcare workers who 

have been placed off work following 

travel or an exposure and who are 

asymptomatic may be asked to return 

to work,” the email reads. “If you 

develop symptoms, stay at home. If 

you develop symptoms at work, do 

not complete your shift and return 

home.”

Nurse 1 said when they received 

this email, they were beginning 

to 
experience 
some 
respiratory 

symptoms and attempted to get 

tested for COVID-19. 

“At that point, I was starting to 

have some mild upper respiratory 

symptoms, I was feeling pretty 

congested, 
fatigued, 
getting 

headaches,” Nurse 1 said. “I called 

employee health and told them all 

the symptoms I was having and they 

were basically like, ‘You don’t meet 

the criteria for testing at this time 

because you don’t have a fever and 

cough, so you’re okay to come back to 

work and just wear a mask.’”

In early March, University of 

Michigan employees were given 

access to extra personal time off 

for COVID-19 related emergencies. 

Katie Oppenheim, chair of the 

University of Michigan Professional 

Nurses Council, said extra time 

off was negotiated for health care 

professionals. 

“The University, March 13, put out 

this 80-hour special personal time off 

bank which is to be used for COVID-

related things, including childcare,” 

Oppenheim said. “We negotiated an 

additional 120 hours for our members 

because they’re at higher risk, and 

then immediately the health system 

provided that to everybody, which is 

great.”

Nurse 1, having stayed home while 

sick using the 80-hour bank, said the 

120 hours cannot be accessed unless 

the employee tests positive and that 

this creates difficulties for people 

experiencing symptoms who can’t get 

tested.

“I know a lot of other people on my 

unit are also experiencing the same 

symptoms and they’re just making 

it really difficult for nurses to get 

tested,” Nurse 1 said. “Not only do I 

have a confirmed patient exposure 

and I’m sick, but the University of 

Michigan won’t let me access that 

special PTO bank that was bargained 

for because I’m not getting tested.”

Oppenheim elaborated on the 

current policy of testing individuals 

only 
with 
strong 
symptoms, 

specifically a fever. 

“There’s no special treatment for 

anybody about testing, health care 

providers, anybody that works in 

the institution, everybody is treated 

the same based on symptoms,” 

Oppenheim said. “The only time you 

stay home is if you are symptomatic, 

so if you were exposed and are 

completely 
asymptomatic, 
then 

you’re just going to monitor your 

temperature and continue to work.”

Michigan Medicine spokesperson 

Mary Masson said she had no 

information to share with The Daily 

regarding the criteria that employees 

must meet to be tested at the moment. 

Nursing junior Rachel Quigley, 

who also is currently working as an 

aid at Michigan Medicine, said she 

has faith in the organization’s ability 

to protect students and workers. 

“Michigan Medicine is really 

committed to protecting us, I feel 

really comfortable and they have an 

employee hotline and everything,” 

Quigley said. “They update us 

numerous times every day, our 

supervisors have been really excellent 

at keeping us updated, we’re not really 

in the dark or anything, and there’s 

information being sent out all the 

time.”

S

ince the first cases of 

COVID-19 — a respiratory 

disease caused by the 

coronavirus — were reported 

in the United States in January, 

American life has been turned 

upside down by an event few will 

ever forget.

The 
coronavirus, 
which 

originated in Wuhan, China at the 

end of 2019, has spread to every 

continent 
except 
Antarctica 
and 
has 

claimed 
over 
42,000 
lives 
worldwide, 

with European countries like Italy 

and Spain being hit especially hard. 

After spreading to all 50 states and 

infecting 
over 
200,000 
nationwide, 

the American economy has come 

to a screeching halt. Schools like 

the University of Michigan have 

moved 
classes 
online, 
non-essential 

businesses have closed and stay-at-

home orders have been issued for 

more than half of the states as well 

as Washington, D.C. 

As the fallout from the COVID-

19 crisis continues to deepen, a 

dark feeling of anxiety has taken 

hold across the country, with some 

saying the pandemic’s impact is 

worse than the Sept. 11 terrorist 

attacks.

Beyond 
the 
medical 
and 

economic implications of this crisis 

for the nation, the coronavirus also 

has broad political implications for 

leaders who will be judged by their 

response to the illness, which 

the World Health Organization 

has declared a global pandemic. 

In particular, President Donald 

Trump is under incessant pressure 

to respond to the coronavirus 

as his re-election bid — which is 

being increasingly complicated by 

the crisis — looms this November.

Many Americans — especially 

those who are opposed to the 

president’s policy agenda — may 

see this pandemic, which coincides 

with a presidential election year, 

as an insurmountable obstacle 

for Trump. But I would disagree. 

While many think that the 

infection will kill off Trump’s 

political career once and for all, the 

crisis is actually an opportunity for 

the President to showcase himself 

as a strong, capable leader for the 

American public. And he’s already 

doing just that.

Since the crisis first began to 

rattle American society, Trump 

has used his executive power to 

protect Americans every step of the 

way. In the direction of qualified 

experts, the president first banned 

travel into the U.S. from China, 

which medical professionals like 

Dr. Anthony Fauci credit as a major 

step toward slowing the spread of 

COVID-19 into our borders. Later, 

as the pandemic ramped up outside 

China, the president moved to 

prohibit travel from Europe as 

well, another critical step that 

likely spared America from the 

worst the coronavirus had to offer.

Beside cutting off travel from 

some of the worst-off areas across 

the globe, Trump has delivered 

the information and resources the 

American people need to overcome 

this illness. In a coordinated, 

bipartisan effort, the president 

helped organize a historic two 

trillion dollar economic stimulus 

bill 
that 
passed 
the 
Senate 

unanimously. 
The 
economic 

aid package promises to give 

individuals and married couples, 

along with small businesses and 

hospitals, the funds they need 

in order to survive these trying 

times.

In addition, with many experts 

fearing that America may become 

the next epicenter of the pandemic, 

Trump has taken dramatic steps 

to fully utilize the resources of the 

federal government to combat the 

coronavirus. Along with working 

to increase the availability of 

testing for COVID-19, Trump took 

the responsible step of invoking 

the Defense Production Act to 

increase the supply of key medical 

products and secure the help 

of hospital ships to combat the 

virus. Moreover, the president 

implemented 
“Coronavirus 

Guidelines 
for 
America,” 
an 

effort that has made Americans 

aware of important steps they 

can take to “flatten the curve.” 

Finally, the president assembled 

the White House Coronavirus 

Task Force, a group of experts, 

including Vice President Mike 

Pence, who work around the 

clock to contain COVID-19 and 

offer key information to the press 

and public.

I

n order to encourage exponential 

growth of renewable energy in the 

coming years, the United States must 

significantly invest in the infrastructure 

of our energy grids. Renewable energy 

faces two main problems: the inherent 

unreliability 
of 
natural 
forces 
and 

the cheap competition of fossil fuels. 

However, 
increasing 
interconnection 

between regional energy grids addresses 

these two central problems of reliability 

and cost-effectiveness by creating a 

market for the transfer of energy between 

states. Connecting our energy grids will 

allow the U.S. to boost the security of 

the green energy supply and integrate 

more renewable energy into the market. 

During extreme weather conditions, 

states need to be able to rely on their 

neighbors to import the electricity they 

need. Yet without proper infrastructure, 

it is impossible to buy and sell electricity 

across borders. Interconnection of our 

regional energy grids is essential for the 

security of green energy supply and thus 

for the growth of green energy.

The main challenge of renewable 

energy is its inherent unreliability, but 

a green energy market 

would bypass the requisite 

of 
sustainability: 
vast 

energy 
storage. 
Solar 

energy in California, for 

example, falls far below the 

necessary energy demands 

in the winter months. Yet 

in the summer months, 

California often has to 

discard their excess solar 

power. The state’s fleet 

of solar farms frequently 

generates more electricity 

than 
Californians 
use 

during the middle of the day, and without 

sufficient energy storage infrastructure, 

this excess electricity is simply thrown 

away. Expensive storage methods such 

as batteries or hydroelectric energy 

storage are technologically possible, but 

extremely expensive and thus carry little 

political traction in California. A cheaper 

alternative is the development of a more 

interconnected regional power grid, 

allowing neighboring states to buy and sell 

energy as necessary. So in summer months 

when California has too much solar 

energy, the state can sell excess electricity 

instead of curtailing it. Meanwhile in 

the winter when there isn’t enough solar 

energy production, the state can import 

other types of green energy such as wind 

energy from Wyoming or New Mexico. 

In this way, a proposed energy market 

could solve our energy storage problem 

by bypassing the problem of storage 

almost entirely. Instead of requiring 

each green energy producer to invest in 

expensive energy storage on top of green 

energy costs, states can just buy and sell 

as needed.

A larger, more interconnected power 

grid would mean each state doesn’t 

have to worry about diversifying their 

individual energy portfolio for energy 

stability, but can still benefit from 

green energy diversity in the region at 

large when necessary. In the European 

Union, 
for 
example, 
Denmark 

already produces excess wind energy, but 

instead of throwing it away, they sell it 

to their neighbors like Norway. Norway 

then stores that energy and can sell 

the electricity to other neighbors when 

demand is high. Interconnection like this 

creates more diverse sources of energy, 

where different regions can benefit from 

their respective advantages in climate 

and geographical features. In this energy 

market, Denmark doesn’t have to plan 

for a day when the wind doesn’t blow by 

turning to fossil fuels or building other 

types of green infrastructure. Instead, 

Denmark can focus on what is most 

efficient for them. And, Norway doesn’t 

have to heavily invest in energy production 

when it is more cost-effective for them 

to invest in energy storage and import 

energy from Denmark. Each state can 

focus on their own geographic or climate 

niche and maximize their individual 

efficiency. In doing so, exporters of green 

energy can make a profit, and importers 

can import cheaper green energy. Take 

a step back, and the European continent 

as a whole system will see a decrease in 

green energy prices and an increase in 

the overall usage of green 

energy.

While 
increased 

interconnection 
of 

regional 
power 
grids 

has 
the 
potential 
to 

make green energy more 

competitive, 
the 
fossil 

fuel industry could also 

capitalize 
and 
benefit 

from 
cheaper 
energy 

exchange. However, the 

energy market in the U.S., 

and the rest of the world, 

is undeniably trending 

towards green energy, and opening up 

the market will only steepen that trend 

over time. An energy market will always 

favor the cheapest and best option, 

and even though coal might still be 

competitive now, an open energy market 

will work to increase the rate so that the 

market phases out fossil fuels eventually. 

Instead of outlawing coal or fossil fuels, 

we can realistically build infrastructure 

in our power grids to incentivize green 

energy through the market.

Discussion 
of 
renewable 
energy 

faces many technological and economic 

hurdles, but we can begin to address 

them 
right 
now 
by 
investing 
in 

infrastructure. 
Renewable 
energy’s 

inherent unreliability can effectively be 

addressed with the interconnection of 

power grids — we don’t need to wait for a 

miracle battery. A bigger, more liquid and 

transparent market would enable easier 

integration of renewables such as wind 

and solar, and help meet the country’s 

renewable energy and climate goals at 

the least cost. It would allow California 

solar energy to be exported rather than 

discarded, and enable access to a greater 

variety of excellent resources, such as wind 

energy in Wyoming. We need to invest 

in interconnection now to incentivize 

renewable energy in the future.

FILM NOTEBOOK

Movies are projections. Yes, literally, in the 

sense of filmstock and screens and projectors 

and bulbs. But movies can also be projections 

of ourselves — a momentary snapshot of the 

internal, the introspective, the metaphysical. And 

given the circumstances, we as the film beat are 

seeing less literal projections in movie theaters 

and doing more projecting ourselves. So what are 

we thinking about? Among them are Tik Toks, 

Tiger King and — of course — the apocalypse. 

This series will traverse the cinematic doomsday 

in its eclectic iterations. After all, why grapple 

with an uncomfortable reality when you can 

watch movies that hyperbolize it completely? 

— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

*

2005 was a fantastic year for movies. In 

just 12 months, “Batman Begins,” “Harry 

Potter and The Goblet of Fire,” “King Kong” 

and “Brokeback Mountain” all hit the screens. 

What do these have in common? They’re all 

produced by major studios like Universal and 

Warner Brothers, and are absolutely wonderful. 

Be it undercutting the superhero myth, pulling 

Harry into a race war, simultaneously honoring 

and critiquing a classic film or depicting a gay 

relationship with honesty and depth, each one 

of these blockbusters did something brave and 

worthwhile. 

Today, most tentpole movies are part of 

a convoluted cinematic universe, critically 

panned or instantly forgettable. It almost 

seems antiquated to imagine a major studio 

release that’s finely crafted. Yet 2005 was full 

of films like “Rent,” “Munich” and “A History 

of Violence,” big budget movies good enough 

to be revered even fifteen years later. There’s a 

dark horse in this lineup, though, which usually 

doesn’t turn up in 2005’s “Best of” lists. Yet it’s 

perhaps the most relevant of any movie released 

that year. 

Steven Spielberg’s “War of The Worlds” is 

not considered a classic like “ET” or “Close 

Encounters of The Third Kind,” the director’s 

two other alien movies. It should be. 

In 2005, the USA was just four years out from 

9/11 and in the midst of Bush’s War on Terror. 

On top of the death tolls in Afghanistan and 

Iraq, Americans contended with the Patriot 

Act, a ramping up of surveillance across the 

nation. Bush’s approval rating was the lowest 

of any president ever while prejudice like 

islamophobia and antisemitism skyrocketed 

throughout the world. Once those towers fell, 

it was harder than ever for people to put trust 

in their government, their neighbors and their 

own safety. 

“ET” just wasn’t gonna cut it anymore. 

“War of The Worlds” begins like many 

of Spielberg’s movies do, with a slice of 

Americana as perfect as Grandma’s apple pie. 

After finishing a shift as a dockworker in New 

Jersey, Ray, played by Tom Cruise (“Mission: 

Impossible - Fallout”), goes home to his kids, 

Robbie and Rachel. It’s his weekend to have 

them from his ex-wife and the first thing he 

wants to do is play a game of catch with his son. 

Both of Ray’s kids are stereotypical 2000s 

kids. Robbie, played by Justin Chatwin 

(“Another Life”), is a sullen, earphones-

wearing teenager with slick black hair who 

complains about everything. Rachel, played 

by Dakota Fanning (“I Am Sam”), dresses in a 

colorful sweater with a pink fur hood, carries 

around horse toys and watches Spongebob 

Squarepants. If one didn’t know the title, they’d 

probably guess the movie would be about Ray 

connecting with his dissatisfied kids and maybe 

even his ex-wife, played by the great Miranda 

Otto (“Lord of The Rings”). 

There are some hints of the darkness to 

come, though. Robbie’s homework, which he 

refuses to start, is about the French occupation 

of Algeria, a notoriously violent, imperialistic 

campaign. In between Spongebob episodes, 

Rachel sees news reports about lightning 

storms from around the world. She changes the 

channel. 

That evening, a storm brews above their 

block, a black spiral in the middle of the sky. 

Lightning strikes again and again, right outside 

their house. The power goes out. When Ray 

goes outside to investigate, his neighbors are 

gathered around the impact zone. The earth 

trembles and everyone starts to run, but it’s too 

late. A gigantic alien machine rises above the 

buildings and gives a great, unearthly screech. 

Then it starts torching people. 

The imagery in this scene is ripped from 

9/11 news footage. Everything is shot on street 

level, giving the carnage a massive scale of 

importance. As buildings topple and spew 

debris in the air and people turn to dust, it’s all 

right in the viewer’s face. The clothes of burn 

victims fly into the air with the force of the heat 

ray but drift down slowly, evoking imagery like 

that of The Falling Man. 

“We need to leave this house in sixty seconds,” 

Ray tells his awe-stricken kids when he makes 

it home. He goes to the mirror and realizes 

his skin is caked in the dust of incinerated 

human beings. Panicking, he washes it off. The 

bloodshot terror in his eyes remains. 

“Is it the terrorists?” Rachel asks. 

All it takes is one minute to bring modern 

America to the brink of apocalypse, to forever 

destroy its sense of peace and security. While 

the aliens are fictional, this scene played 

out a thousand times over on Sept. 11, 2001. 

Americans watched in horror as carnage rained 

down from above. Afterward, they had to face 

their kids and try to explain that their country 

wasn’t safe anymore. 

As the alien attack continues, Spielberg 

destroys countless American motifs. A looming 

highway is blown apart, sending cars crashing 

into a row of townhouses. Rachel stands next 

to a sparkling river in upstate New York, like 

something out of Walden, and dozens of bodies 

float by, clogging the water. An Amtrak train 

rattles past through the dark, in flames. A 

statue of a Minuteman is wrapped in alien red 

weed. Refugees clog the main street of a small 

town as Sinatra plays in the background. “If I 

ruled the world…” 

Rachel herself is a breathing American 

symbol, the typical blonde-haired daughter in 

her purple coat, clutching her horse toys. She 

shrieks throughout the movie like a canary in 

a coal mine, American innocence thrown into 

violent chaos. In the end, when she faces the 

most horrific thing imaginable, she’s silent, 

dead-eyed. Like most of us, she’s so used to the 

terror that it has become everyday. 

Scenes from an apocalypse: ‘War of the Worlds’

Future Nostalgia

Dua Lipa

MUSIC REVIEW
Dua Lipa reinvents the past on ‘Future Nostalgia’

DIANA YASSIN
Daily Arts Writer

Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia was actually 

supposed to come out this week, with an original 

release date of April 3rd. But in late March, a full 

leak of the album hit the internet. This placed Lipa 

in a complicated position: postponing her album 

release would be a seemingly pointless pursuit. 

She addressed the situation in an emotionally 

packed Instagram Live stream that ranged in 

topics, spanning from the future of her album to 

the UK’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. 

“In these kind of situations we all need to actively 

work together to make a change,” Lipa said. “What 

I’m gonna do is, instead of my album coming out 

April 3rd, my album is actually gonna come out 

this Friday.” In light of the pandemic, many artists 

actually did the exact opposite, delaying their 

album releases.

Despite the negative background surrounding 

its release, Future Nostalgia is a peppy, fun step 

forward in Lipa’s career. Lipa’s 2017 self-titled debut 

cemented her as a successful, stable pop force. 

Radio mammoth “New Rules” dominated charts 

worldwide and the debut garnered Lipa her status 

as 2017’s most streamed female artist. She played 

this route to pop stardom safely, though; her 17-track 

debut contained a lot of EDM filler, tactful collabs 

and on-trend Ed Sheeran lyrics about anxiety and 

party-skipping. Her appeal felt formulaic, almost 

indecipherable in a music sphere with receding 

pop dominance. There wasn’t a distinct personality 

to Lipa’s celebrity, her then lacking stage presence 

picking up slack in meme potential. Her leathery, 

molasses-thick register was her saving grace, 

polished like a relic from pop music’s past. 

For this reason, Future Nostalgia is a testament 

to Lipa’s evolution and greater control of her career. 

The new era is as distinct a shift for Lipa’s image as 

her two-toned bob. Shortly following her breakup 

with longtime boyfriend Isaac Carew, Lipa had a 

relationship with Anwar Hadid and a leading single 

that blithely addresses her ex. “Did the heartbreak 

change me? Maybe,” she croons in “Don’t Start 

Now.” “But look at where I ended up / I’m all good 

all ready / so moved on it’s scary.” Her voice is 

strong, almost melismatic, but it glides effortlessly 

off the thumping percussion and pulsing synths. 

An electric violin in the bridge elevates this already 

buoyant boogie track with a groovy disco flare. 

Follow-up single “Physical” has the same vintage 

bubble wrap, but with an anthemic intensity. Lipa 

chants “Let’s get physical” over a neon, almost 

jazzercise-type 
melody. 

While very imitative, its 

chugging synthline and 

synth flares don’t come 

off as dated. 

Lipa both literally and 

figuratively 
breathes 

“Future Nostalgia” into 

the initial title track. A 

robotic 
voice 
harkens 

back to Prince’s “1999” while also whispering 

“future” throughout the song’s intro. From there 

hovers a comfortably cheesy keyboard melody and 

flaring synths. Lipa wears the unabashedly chunky 

bassline like a chain as she proclaims, “You want a 

timeless song / I want to change the game,” as if to 

state her album’s mission. The song carries the same 

stratosphere of the ’80s, but her attitude anchors it 

to the future with contemporary commentary and 

references to futurist artist John Lautner. 

While never as kitsch as the intro track, a similarly 

contagious ’80s pop ether 

coats every moment on 

Future Nostalgia. Some 

songs contemplate the 

transcendent, 
altering 

nature 
of 
love 
and 

romance. 
“Levitating” 

is galactic and starry 

eyed 
with 
wobbly, 

rhythmic 
synths 
and 

spacey imagery that call a “sugar boo” to dance 

in the moonlight and “fly away.” Similarly, hazy 

“Hallucinate” pulses with laser beam flares and 

promises to “love you like a fool.” Other songs 

wrestle with the tension of recent heartbreak and 

newfound love. Most notable is her recent single 

“Break My Heart” that considers the anxiety and 

potential doom of a newfound love. Hypnotic 

and dreamy standout track “Love Again” visits 

similar territory with a simple violin melody that 

flourishes under the vision of developing trust in a 

new romance. 

Future Nostalgia operates under a vision that is 

equal parts visceral and nostalgic. With the ambition 

to reinvent herself, Dua Lipa modernizes an iconic 

pop sound. This goes down to the very fabric of 

the album, thumb-tacking legendary sounds and 

moments in ’80s music with a contemporary bend. 

By collaborating with disco legend Niles Rodgers on 

the album and tracking back to the near forgotten 

pop trend of the 2000s, Lipa honors the past as she 

breathes life into the EDM pop scene that kick-

started her artistry. Beyond the ’80s synth-packing 

Lipa, Future Nostalgia is a balanced blend of raw 

vulnerability and empowerment as Lipa navigates 

love, self assurance and heartbreak. Despite its 

newness and early appearance in her career, Lipa’s 

Future Nostalgia is a timeless pop masterpiece.

The other day I was cursorily perusing my 

housemate’s New York Times, and, amidst the 

portents of apocalypse, I came across an agitated 

letter to the editor in the book review. 

“Confirming a trend I’ve noticed with 

annoyance on bookstore shelves,” the man 

wrote, not one, and not two but “fully three” 

of the novels reviewed 

last week had writers as 

their protagonists. This 

isn’t counting Elizabeth 

Tallent’s memoir, which 

is also about writing. Four 

books, each written with 

what this man seems to 

see as the same sort of 

unforgivable myopia, the 

same sort of decadent 

navel-gazing, a literary 

inbreeding that can only 

be a dead end. “Based 

on 
the 
reviews,” 
the 

man continues, “all the 

aforementioned 
writers 

appear to be frustrated 

in some way.” It’s unclear 

whether he means the writers depicted in the 

novels or the writers themselves, though, of 

course, it can be difficult to separate the two at 

times. “Maybe they could find some satisfaction 

in writing about people with a job title different 

from their own,” the man writes. “There are lots 

of us out there.” By this point it’s mostly clear that 

the man wants the writers who have published 

novels to write about something else now; though 

I like the idea of him offering advice to the fictional 

characters of books he hasn’t read; for if these 

characters have the misfortune to be created by 

writers, they can at least avoid another level of 

recursion. 

Petty as it is, his accusation isn’t unfounded: 

A lot of debut novels I’ve come across recently 

do seem like a frustrated writer’s attempt to 

exorcise their process. This can produce good art, 

of course: The process of becoming a writer is an 

extended mundanity that transforms itself into a 

psychodrama if you let it. While we all know that 

writing is mostly just fiddling with characters 

and situations and sentences and above all the 

proverbial “ass in chair” that we are all so very 

good at avoiding, it can be fun to pretend that it’s 

something else. For my 

part, I confess that literary 

fiction about writers is 

like candy to me. Maybe 

that makes me elitist by 

someone’s metric, and I 

don’t care. 

Another thing our irate 

epistolarian might have 

missed: A lot of people 

with more humble “job 

titles” are also writers 

and (depending on how 

you want to look at it) 

vice versa. Lily King’s 

fifth novel, “Writers & 

Lovers,” is a novel about a 

writer who also works as 

a waitress, and a lot more 

time is spent on waitressing than on writing. It’s 

a job title that is starting to make Casey, the first-

person protagonist, seem a little ridiculous: She’s 

31, an age that functions as a pivot. Here, one is 

faced with the reality of adult life and the fading 

of the exuberance of your twenties; there are 

suddenly considerations of stability. To persevere 

as an artist requires a certain amount of fortitude, 

especially if, like Casey, you haven’t found much 

success as an artist yet. She’s been working on her 

novel (provisional title: “Love & The Revolution”) 

for six years, in the process going between 

cities and boyfriends all over North America 

and Europe. She’s ended up in Cambridge, 

Massachusetts after a bad breakup, is working at 

a restaurant on the third floor of a Harvard social 

club and living in a tiny room sublet from her 

brother’s sadistic friend Adam (who at one point 

tells Casey “I just find it extraordinary that you 

think you have something to say”). King might 

want us to see Casey’s stubborn perseverance as 

heroic, but it also seems like Casey is doing this 

simply because she can’t be happy doing anything 

else. The recent death of her mother in a freak 

accident has left Casey emotionally fraught and it 

becomes increasingly clear that her novel, which 

incorporates elements of her mother’s biography, is 

a way for her to cope at least as much as it is a work 

of art that she eventually wants to finish and show 

people. Casey’s character isn’t self-dramatizing in 

the slightest; she instead has a talent for noticing 

things about people, picking up on intentions and 

empathizing. Casey feels everything in a way that’s 

contagious. A lot of sentences in this book start 

with “I love…” 

Additionally, King shows us how complicated 

this kind of life is to sustain while maintaining 

one’s sanity; we see how Casey has to adapt her 

mind to at least two playing fields, that of the 

service worker and that of the aspiring artist. She 

goes from writing her novel in the mornings to 

working at the restaurant in the afternoon to going 

on dates with other writers or going to literary 

parties at night; each space requires a particular 

use of language, a particular code. The restaurant 

itself is a kind of microcosm of the double 

consciousness she has to sustain on a larger scale 

in the rest of her life — she ducks into the kitchen 

and has to deal with the crass behavior (and 

sometimes harassment) of the cooks, then brings 

food to the restaurant’s wealthy patrons, doing her 

best to charm them. 

This theme of double consciousness is further 

elaborated by that most quintessential of novelistic 

tropes — a love triangle. Like all good fictional love 

triangles, each vertex represents a possibility for 

Casey’s life. She meets Oscar, a 45-year-old author 

who runs a regular writing workshop, when he 

comes into her work with his sons for mother’s day. 

They are, in a slightly morbid fashion, celebrating 

Oscar’s dead wife. Casey charms Oscar’s sons, and 

he takes a liking to her. Through being around 

Oscar and his endearing children, Casey starts to 

imagine a life for herself that settles nicely into 

adulthood but might mean giving up her writing. 

Also in the picture is Silas, a regular attendee of 

Oscar’s workshop who spurs intense physical 

passion in Casey but has boyish qualities, not the 

least of which being that he tends to vanish for 

weeks at a time. Her struggles to choose seem 

increasingly like a referendum on her life: a gentle 

fade into the responsibilities and small joys of 

adulthood or the continuation of the sometimes 

messy process of trying to make it work as an artist. 

In the meantime, so much happens. Casey 

has reams and reams of backstory to intersperse 

this mostly straightforward plot with; there’s 

also, of course, the business of writing and 

getting published, the mundane struggles of life 

exacerbated by precarity (a cancer scare, sexual 

harassment, her landlord threatening to sell out 

her apartment, etc.). In many ways, King has 

a maximalist approach to realist fiction, one 

that seeks to capture life as it is lived. Life tends 

to pleasantly overwhelm plot. The jumble of 

situations, the huge chaos of characters (I counted 

26 after the first chapter, and more keep getting 

added later) and the endless backstory started to 

feel like the point after a while. In the face of the 

luminous digression of King’s style, the writing 

that Casey does often ends up being the least 

interesting part, though I was definitely rooting 

for her success.

I feel as though accusations like that of the 

writer to the New York Times assume that writing 

about writers is necessarily self-involved, that 

writers treat their work as uniquely heroic and 

deserving of attention. It’s not like anyone has 

to respond to an accusation of self-involvement 

(really, who isn’t self-involved?) but King’s writing 

ultimately feels very generous. Casey’s ambitions 

give the plot of the story a motivating force, but it’s 

by no means what makes the novel compelling.

BOOK REVIEW

TV NOTEBOOK
What cop TV reveals about our relationship with police

ANYA SOLLER
Daily Arts Writer

Over spring break, I spent the day at my 

grandparents’ house watching old shows from the 

1960’s. I hadn’t seen many of them before and was 

excited to laugh at the fun fashion and the era’s 

simplistic, slapstick comedy. After a few episodes 

of “Bewitched” and “Green Acres,” the channel 

transitioned into that night’s marathon of “The 

Andy Griffith Show.” 

While I wasn’t as familiar with other shows, 

I knew the basics of this one. Sheriff Andy Taylor 

(Andy Griffith, “Matlock”) protects and serves the 

small town of Mayberry while raising his young 

son, Opie (Ron Howard, “Arrested Development”). 

After the first episode about the town’s beauty 

pageant ended, I felt I got the gist. Sheriff Andy and 

the people of Mayberry are sweet and kind, with a 

tendency toward endearing eccentrism. 

The next episode was about two old ladies 

secretly running a moonshine business while 

turning in their competition to the sheriff so they’d 

get more customers. It was an adorable story to 

be sure, but one particular moment caught me 

off guard. When arresting one of the moonshine 

producers, Sheriff Andy doesn’t read him his 

rights. It took me a moment to remember Miranda 

warnings weren’t implemented in arrests until 

1966, five years after the episode aired.

Police procedurals have been a staple of 

American TV since the mid-1950s with shows like 

“Dragnet” and “The Untouchables” but the more 

modern, slightly grittier version of cop shows came 

later with 1980s classics “Hill Street Blues” and 

“Miami Vice.” These programs popularized the 

format while amping up the stakes for an audience 

now keyed in to crime thanks to the 24 hour 

news cycle. Perhaps the most influential police 

procedural of all time, “Law and Order,” is the best 

example of how crime-themed TV reflected (and 

affected) the American public.

“Law and Order,” and its successful spin-off 

“Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,” each have 

upwards of 20 seasons and are known for their 

hallmark style of including stories “ripped from 

the headlines.” With more serious storylines and 

a loyal audience, these series could explore more 

difficult and controversial topics than “The Andy 

Griffith Show” could ever dream of. The comfort 

of small-town justice is entirely absent in modern 

police procedurals which tend to examine the 

most frightening aspects of our society and deeply 

flawed legal system.

As I sat in my grandparents’ house, wondering 

how there was ever a time before Miranda rights, 

I wondered if there was something deeper at play 

in Mayberry. In the past few years, one particular 

scene circulated the Internet in which Sheriff Andy 

remarks, “When a man carries a gun all the time, the 

respect he thinks he’s getting might really be fear… 

I don’t carry a gun, because I don’t want the people 

of Mayberry to fear a gun. I’d rather they respect 

me.” The quote garnered much attention from 

gun control advocates who lauded his nonviolent 

sentiment, but in the context of the arrest scene I 

watched, that positive message is complicated.

The people of Mayberry trust Sheriff Andy. But, 

the world of Mayberry is not as complicated as the 

worlds depicted in “Hill Street Blues” or “Law and 

Order.” The world of “The Andy Griffith Show” 

doesn’t exist anymore, and in fact, it never existed 

at all. There was no idyllic, peaceful small-town 

America. At least, not one that wasn’t plagued 

with other issues of racial discrimination or the 

oppression of marginalized groups. The trust 

citizens of Mayberry had for their sheriff was partly 

because of the town’s lack of serious crime but also 

because he looked and acted like them.

This mutual respect and admiration, while most 

obvious in early examples, is a common thread 

throughout American police procedurals. “Law 

and Order: Special Victims Unit” often challenges 

this assumption by addressing issues that affect 

disadvantaged 
communities 
and 
emphasize 

the fallibility of law enforcement. But for all the 

empathy Olivia Benson and her team elicit, they’re 

still cops. They sometimes arrest the wrong guy 

or harass suspects. In one episode, one of the SVU 

detectives shoots an unarmed, Black teenager and, 

though he regrets his actions, he is still considered 

the protagonist of the show. 

Therein lies the conundrum of police-themed 

TV. Do we frame cops as trustworthy heroes 

because we trust the police or because we wish 

we did? In a time when police brutality and lack of 

accountability are daily news stories, our cultural 

obsession 
with 
crime-related 
entertainment 

presents a distinct juxtaposition between how we 

feel and how we want to feel. In “The Andy Griffith 

Show,” the suspects trust the sheriff to respect them 

without a statement of their rights. But that’s not 

how things work. We need civil rights, we need to 

be innocent until proven guilty, we need protection 

from abuses of the law. 

As we continue to watch shows that idealize our 

relationship with law enforcement, as a country we 

need to consider why we need the scripted format 

of TV to comfort us in this way. Do we just like the 

mystery and entertainment of crime stories and 

cops are the incidental protagonists? Or are we less 

interested in the lives of people in Mayberry and 

more invested in heroes like Sheriff Andy? And 

if the latter is true, what does that say about us? If 

we continue to glorify the ideal while ignoring the 

reality of our justice system, change will remain on 

screen, just beyond our reach.
