coach beelines 
to cleveland

John Beilein will leave Michigan 
to become the new coach of the 
Cleveland Cavaliers after signing a 
five-year deal, according to a report 
from ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. 
The news has also been confirmed 
by Michigan spokesperson Tom 
Wywrot. The school has no plans for 
a press conference today, or in the 
near future, per Wywrot.
According 
to 
Wojnarowski, 
Beilein reached a decision on Sunday 
and informed his staff and players 
Monday morning. Beilein himself 
confirmed the news via Twitter later 
in the morning.
“Thanks to everyone at the Univ of 
Michigan for their incredible support 
these last 12 years,” Beilein tweeted. 

“Our fans, alums, leaders, players and 
students are AMAZING It has been a 
heck of a ride and I hope you enjoyed 
our teams and staff as much as I did! 
Go Blue Forever! #GoBlue”
The Cleveland Cavaliers also 
issued a statement from Beilein 
on 
their 
website 
alongside 
announcements 
from 
general 
manager Koby Altman and chairman 
Dan Gilbert.
“I want to thank the University 
of Michigan for what has been a 
truly special home and remarkable 
place for my family and I for the last 
12 years. We have achieved great 
success together and we could not 
have done it without the incredible 
support 
of 
our 
administration, 
coaches, players, staff, students, fans 
and the entire university community. 
We shared some of the best moments 

of my life together and I will always 
be grateful for that,” Beilein said in 
the statement. “At the same time, 
I felt very strongly about this new 
and exciting opportunity with the 
Cavaliers. I am very thankful to 
Dan Gilbert and Koby Altman and 
honored to be the head coach of the 
Cavaliers. I love the position the team 
is in to build and grow and this was 
something I felt was the perfect fit for 
me. With hard work and dedication 
by all of us, we will grow this team 
day by day and reinforce a culture 
of success that sustains itself with 
strong core values. Cleveland is a 
great city with amazing fans and I 
am really looking forward to calling 
Cleveland home for years to come.”
Altman cited Beilein’s ability 
to build a culture and his winning 
pedigree at the college level, saying 

they interviewed several candidates 
and it was clear Beilein would be the 
best fit.
“He has a unique ability to 
create an outstanding culture that 
will promote the development of 
young players and provide a solid 
structure to the entire program; not 
to mention the fact that John Beilein 
wins everywhere he goes,” Altman 
said. “We are excited Coach Beilein 
is joining our organization as we 
continue to build the foundation that 
any enterprise needs to be successful 
and competitive year in and year 
out.”
Beilein was hired as the coach 
of the Michigan men’s basketball 
team in 2007. Since then, he has 
led the Wolverines to nine NCAA 
Tournaments, five Sweet Sixteens 
and two Final Fours. During the 

same time frame, he won Big Ten 
regular-season titles in 2012 and 
2014 and tournament titles in 2017 
and 2018. He revived a program that 
previously had not made the NCAA 
Tournament since 1998.
In the recently concluded 2018-
19 season, Beilein guided Michigan 
to a record-best 17-0 start and an 
eventual 30-7 record, making the 
finals of the Big Ten Tournament. 
The Wolverines earned a No. 2 seed 
in March Madness, where they 
lost to Texas Tech in the Sweet 
Sixteen. However, in the aftermath, 
several key players — wing Charles 
Matthews, 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole 
and forward Ignas Brazdeikis — 
declared for the draft, and Poole and 
Matthews have already announced 
they will remain there.

Legislators show 
support of ‘One U’

12 congresspeople 
sign Free Press op-ed 
supporting ‘equitable’ 
campus funding

On 
Wednesday 
morning, 
state Sen. Curtis Hertel, Jr., 
D-Lansing, 
and 
state 
Rep. 
Jon 
Hoadley, 
D-Kalamazoo, 
published an opinion piece in 
the Detroit Free Press titled 
“University 
of 
Michigan 
students in Flint and Dearborn 
are shortchanged. That has to 
stop.” Signed by a dozen state 
legislators, the article discusses 
disparities 
in 
funding 
and 
resources across the University 
of Michigan’s three campuses.
“As members of the Michigan 
State 
Legislature, 
we 
are 
incredibly proud that our state 
is home to the University of 
Michigan,” Hertel and Hoadley 
wrote. “But we were elected to 
stand up for all Michiganders — 

and today, we call on the Leaders 
and Best to do better.”
The op-ed comes one day 
before 
the 
One 
University 
Campaign 
plans 
to 
“pack” 
the final Board of Regents 
meeting to “demand equitable 
funding 
for 
(the) 
UM-Flint 
and UM-Dearborn campuses.” 
Formed 
in 
fall, 
the 
One 
University 
Campaign 
is 
a 
coalition of students, faculty, 
staff and community members 
aiming to promote equitable 
distribution 
of 
funding 
and 
resources 
between 
the 
University’s 
three 
campuses. 
The campaign also hopes to 
ensure long-term support for the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses 
from University President Mark 
Schlissel, the Board of Regents 
and the state legislature.
In a statement provided to The 
Daily, One University spokesman 
Austin Ogle confirmed the op-ed 
was written in coordination 
with the 1U campaign.

Schools host joint 
conference in 
Ypsilanti Friday

Friday night, nearly 100 health 
professionals, 
researchers, 
policymakers 
and 
community 
members 
gathered 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
and 
Harvard University at the Ypsilanti 
Marriott Resort at Eagle Crest to 
discuss research done on the United 
States’s opioid epidemic. The seven-
hour summit, titled “Opioids: Policy 
to Practice,” featured Rear Admiral 
Sylvia Trent-Adams, Ph.D., R.N., 
F.A.A.N. as the keynote speaker. 
University President Mark Schlissel 
also gave special remarks as well 
as commentary from four other 
panels.
University professor of surgery 
Michael Englesbe began the third 
panel on health system approaches 
to opioid prescription. He explained 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
people 
suffering from opioid abuse are 
first introduced to it by doctors and 
surgeons.
“Particularly 
disturbing 
are 
women who have had breast 
cancer … (and) survived the cancer, 
almost 20 percent of those women 
become chronic opioid users after 
that horrible journey,” Englesbe 
said. “It essentially comes down to 
overprescribing.”
According 
to 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Institution 
for 
Healthcare Policy and Innovation 

brief, prescriptions often far exceed 
pain 
management 
needs 
and 
“becoming a new chronic opioid 
user is the most common post-
surgical complication.”
University 
professor 
of 
anesthesiology, 
medicine 
and 
psychiatry, Dr. Daniel Clauw, said 
he was originally trained to not 
treat chronic pain with opioids. 
According to Clauw, the industry’s 
shift came in 1997 when the Food 
and Drug Administration changed 
the label for oxycontin and deemed 
it acceptable for health professionals 
to prescribe to their patients.
“One of the things that really 
makes my head explode is when 
the narrative is driven by these 
anecdotes, by these patients that 
are brought up before the FDA … 
that say they’re on high doses of 
opioids and that they are doing 
incredibly well,” Clauw said. “I talk 
about those individuals that are on 
very high dosages of opioids that are 
doing very well. I say, ‘these are like 
unicorns: I’ve heard about them, but 
I’ve never seen them.’”
Clauw blames pharmacies for not 
stopping the distribution of opioids 
despite knowing the dangers that 
came along with it. He said they are 
no less of a cartel than the street 
traffickers.
“The 
drug 
distributors 
and 
pharmacies 
knew 
exactly 
what 
was going on,” Clauw said. “They 
knew about these drug mules and 
everything like that, but they were 
making a lot of money, and they 
weren’t doing anything to stop this.

U.S. 
District 
Judge 
Arthur Tarnow has ordered 
University 
of 
Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel to 
appear in court June 11 as a 
result of the Doe v. Univer-
sity of Michigan lawsuit. On 
Wednesday afternoon, Tar-
now turned down a motion 
from University lawyers 
which would have over-
turned the order requiring 
Schlissel’s appearance.
Tarnow 
originally 
ordered Schlissel to court 
by May 1 during a tele-
conference 
with 
Joshua 
Richards, a Pennsylvania-
based attorney represent-
ing the University, and 
the 
unnamed 
plaintiff’s 
attorney Deborah Gordon, 
a Bloomfield Hills civil 
rights attorney. During the 
teleconference, 
Gordon 
echoed 
Tarnow’s 
senti-
ments regarding Schlissel’s 
attendance in court, while 
Richards made repeated 
arguments 
against 
the 
order.
The order came out of 
a case involving a male 
undergraduate student who 
sued the University in June 
2018. The student, referred 
to as “John Doe,” was on 
track to graduate and had 
been accepted to the Uni-
versity’s graduate engineer-
ing program, in addition to 
programs at other colleges. 
The student felt his future 
was endangered when the 
University froze his tran-
script and degree follow-
ing a complaint of sexual 
assault against him.
Doe’s 
transcript 
was 
released in June, within a 
week of the lawsuit being 
filed.

The 
allegations 
trace 
back to November 2017, 
when a female student 
reached out to Doe, a Uni-
versity residential adviser, 
about getting together. Doe 
invited her to his room, at 
which point they watched a 
movie and had sexual rela-
tions. Four months later, in 
March 2018, the female stu-
dent accused Doe of sexual-
ly assaulting her during the 
interaction in a complaint 
filed with the University’s 
Office 
of 
Institutional 
Equity.
The female student said 
Doe 
had 
nonconsensual 
sex with her in his resi-
dence hall room. However, 
Doe said in the lawsuit the 
encounter was consensual 
and no drugs or alcohol 
were involved, the Detroit 
News reported. There were 
no witnesses to the encoun-
ter in question.
The lawsuit aligns with 
a 2017 ruling regarding the 
University of Cincinnati, in 
which a similar case found-
ed exclusively upon “he 
said/she said” grounds and 
in which defendant failed 
to “provide any form of 
confrontation of the accus-
er” made the proceeding 
“fundamentally unfair” to 
the case’s defendant.
Doe said in the lawsuit he 
was unaware of the allega-
tions during his interview 
with the OIE, rendering 
him unable to respond ade-
quately. Additionally, the 
lawsuit claimed the Univer-
sity refused the option for a 
hearing or cross-examina-
tion to Doe, even though 
this is provided to students 
facing other violations.

Judge orders 
Schlissel to
district court

On Wednesday night, the 
city of Ann Arbor held an open 
forum event for residents to 
meet the three final candi-
dates for a new chief of police: 
Michael Cox of Boston, Bryan 
Jarrell of Arizona and Ann 
Arbor’s Jason Forsberg. There 
were nearly 50 attendees from 
City Council members to 
police officers and civilians.
In the casual, cocktail 
hour-style event, attendees 
were able to openly converse 
with the candidates. Cox, Jar-
rell and Forsberg each spoke 
with The Daily about a range 
of issues including their past 
experience, their thoughts on 
cross-jurisdiction cooperation 
with the University of Michi-
gan police and their plans to 
move forward with the new 
Independent 
Community 
Police Oversight Commission.
For nearly 25 years, Ser-
geant Bill Clock has served 
with the Ann Arbor Police 
Department. Clock said he and 
his fellow officers would want 
a chief who is committed to 
the department, open to offi-
cers’ ideas, well-educated and 
experienced.
“I think the biggest thing 
for me is someone who will 

listen to our suggestions and 
what we want and then make 
the decision and that’s the 
decision,” Clock said. “They’re 
the boss, and they’re going to 
choose.”
The new chief of police will 
be replacing Robert Pfannes, 
interim chief of police, who 
is planning to retire May 24. 
Pfannes has spent 21 years 
with the Ann Arbor Police 
Department as Deputy Chief.
“We just need stable leader-
ship,” Clock said. “I think we’re 
open to whatever direction we 
go. We haven’t had a true chief 
for over a year, so it’s tough 
to kind of move forward and 
progress without that. What-
ever candidate is chosen, I’m 
sure will be best for the job. We 
just want stable leadership.”
Ann Arbor’s new ICPOC 
has been at the center of the 
search for a new chief. The 
commission was formed as 
civilian monitoring of the 
AAPD following the fatal 
shooting of Aura Rosser in 
2014 by an officer, and the posi-
tion’s public listing noted the 
commission as a unique chal-
lenge for the appointee.
Councilmember Ali Ram-
lawi, D-Ward 5, is one of the 
City Council’s two lesions on 
the 
oversight 
commission. 
Ramlawi told The Daily what 

the commission is looking for 
in a new chief, noting commit-
ment and open-mindedness.
“I think one that is open to 
new ideas; one that has faced 
some of the challenges we 
face here — somebody who 
has some longevity,” Ramlawi 
said. “I’d like to see someone 
who’s going to be here for a 
while, and someone who’s 
receptive, asking questions, 
interested, really trying to get 
to know the challenges in the 
community and know how to 
apply themselves. We’re look-
ing for a lot of things. No one 
is perfect. We’re looking for 
the type of person who fits the 
needs of our community.”
The oversight commission 
has held two official meetings, 
one of which was an emergen-
cy meeting Tuesday night with 
the city’s HR department. For-
mer HR director Robyn Wilk-
erson resigned May 1 after 
accusations of sending inap-
propriate text messages which 
were negative toward the 
Black Lives Matter movement 
and the oversight commission. 
The commission convened 
to investigate whether Wilk-
erson’s actions tainted the 
recruitment process for a new 
police chief.
Assistant City Administra-
tor John Fournier was also 

present at the meeting. Fourni-
er said it was an “illuminating” 
meeting and provided a lot of 
insight to the public regarding 
how the recruitment process 
was carried out.
“When you’re in a position 
of public importance and pub-
lic service, it’s really impor-
tant to be transparent, and it’s 
really important to be open to 
oversight and communication 
and things like that,” Fournier 
said. “We take that really seri-
ously in Ann Arbor.”
Ramlawi said he was sat-
isfied with how the meeting 
transpired.
“I feel more comfortable 
knowing that officials from 
our city have gone on record 
indicating 
(contamination 
of the recruitment process) 
wasn’t the case,” Ramlawi 
said. “It gives the community 
more confidence and comfort 
in the process.”
Clock said he has con-
fidence 
in 
the 
profes-
sionalism of the police 
department and does not 
believe they need an over-
sight commission, but he 
respects the city residents’ 
desire to establish one 
nonetheless.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

A

s two long-serving lecturers 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, we understand 
the importance of building a legacy 
for generations of students to 
come. For the past 20 and 32 years, 
we’ve taken pride in working for a 
University that stands for what is 
right, that prioritizes its students 
over profits and that respects 
faculty and its obligation to honor 
contractual agreements with all 
employees. Over the past few 
months, however, the administration 
of the University’s School of Music, 
Theatre, and Dance has shown a 
reckless disregard for all three. 
It 
is 
therefore 
with 
great 
disappointment that we write this 
letter outlining a series of deceptions, 
stonewalls and contract violations 
coming from the SMTD we know 
and love — because we know our 
University is better than this. 
Last July, the Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization 
(LEO) 
ratified 
a 
new contract with the University 
administration. The contract gave 
us the salary increases and health 
benefits many of us needed to live 
and work effectively. It also required 
SMTD to pay the two of us a higher 
salary to fairly compensate for our 
depth of experience and outstanding 
results. 
Rather than pay us our worth and 
give students the instruction they 
deserve, SMTD chose instead to cut 
our course load by 50 percent and 
66 percent for the next academic 
year. This in itself is a travesty: 
The University prioritized profits 
over giving its students a quality 

education. Even more disappointing, 
however, was the series of events 
which took place in the process of 
issuing these layoffs. 
First 
and 
foremost, 
SMTD 
violated our contract when it failed 
to forewarn us about the layoffs, 
choosing instead to wait until we 
approached them with questions 
about class cuts. 
Secondly, SMTD lied both to us 
and The Michigan Daily when it 
denied LEO’s new contract as the 
reason for the layoffs. On February 
20, the Chair of the Dance Program 
sent an email to Missy Beck stating, 
“Because of the large increase in 
LEO salaries, the administration 
would like to move as many LEO 
courses as possible to tenure track 
faculty.” When prompted by The 
Daily, however, the chair denied 
the email existed and said she was 
“amazed at how many invented 
facts are circulating.” This disregard 
for honesty and accountability is 
unacceptable.
Thirdly, SMTD continues to 
change its reasons for laying both 
of us off. Over the last few months, 
they have cited lack of qualification 
and low enrollment as rationale for 
these changes. More recently, the 
reasons have been “wanting to go in 
a different direction,” and that our 
job loss is “necessary (italics added) 
to offer additional opportunities and 
expand the learning experiences for 
our students.” Having taught here 
for decades with nothing short of 
outstanding results and consistent 
enrollment, however, we know none 
of these to be true — and are greatly 

disappointed 
by 
the 
deception 
and delays in providing rational 
explanations for these actions. 
Over a dozen lecturers and other 
allies gathered last week to speak 
out against these shameful tactics. 
Some of SMTD’s most successful 
alumni have turned out in droves to 
write letters and film videos urging 
them to reconsider this decision. 
But SMTD continues to ignore 
the pleas of their alumni who are 
Tony nominees and winners, Oscar 
nominees and winners, professional 
dancers, heads of dance programs 
in 
higher 
education, 
Broadway 
performers, producers and so much 
more, all of whom have insisted our 
work has been integral to their success. 
Students, alumni, lecturers and 
community members are coming 
together to demand better from a 
university to which we give so much. 
It is truly disheartening to see 
this University treat us with such 
disregard after we have devoted 
our entire professional lives to our 
students with such outstanding 
results. The University of Michigan 
prides itself in providing a world-
class education for its students and 
an excellent working environment 
for its staff. We call on SMTD to live 
up to this creed and treat its long-
serving lecturers with the respect 
they deserve.

T

he effort to eliminate public 
school segregation in Ameri-
ca has stalled.
Our school systems are just as seg-
regated today as they were decades 
ago. A combination of factors includ-
ing “white flight,” gerrymandered 
school districts, the rise of charter 
and private schools and the decima-
tion of civil rights legislation such 
as the Civil Rights Act of 1968, also 
known as the Fair Housing Act, have 
contributed to this. A recent report 
estimated that predominantly non-
white school districts receive $23 bil-
lion less than white districts despite 
serving the same number of students. 
How can this be? 
It’s simple. The United States, 
unlike most of the world, has left the 
education of its citizens up to individ-
ual states. The “right” to a free, pub-
lic education is implied though never 
addressed directly in the Constitu-
tion. Federal dollars compose on aver-
age less than 10 percent of a school 
districts budget, while the rest comes 
from state and local funding. Usually 
a school district is first funded from 
local property taxes. The state usually 
has a minimum funding level, so if the 
district is unable to meet that with the 
money generated from taxes, the state 
would step in to bridge the gap to the 
minimum level. Sounds fair right?
Unfortunately, states aren’t always 
able to contribute what is needed 
and leave lower-income districts 
scrambling to provide basic needs. 
In the wake of the Great Recession, 
state and local governments slashed 
funding for K-12 education. This, of 
course, hit the poorer districts the 
hardest. Wealthier districts, on the 
other hand, take in so much more 
money from their local taxes that 
they are able to deal with most fund-
ing shortages.
The quality of education you grow 
up with is tied to where you live. By 
doing this, we are cementing the 
pathway of upward mobility in this 
nation with the social engineering 
of those in power. While poorer dis-
tricts in general receive less funding 
than wealthier ones, the contrast is 
especially stark when looking at the 
racial disparity. In general, non-white 
districts receive an average of $2,226 
less per student than white districts. 
High-poverty, white districts still 
receive $782 more per student than 
low-poverty, non-white districts and 
a staggering near $1,500 more than 
high-poverty non-white districts. “A 
single fact is clear — financially, it is 
far better in the United States to have 
the luck and lot to attend a school 
district that is predominantly white 

than one that enrolls a concentration 
of children of color.” 
Even when a school district is less 
segregated, issues arise. It is well 
documented that “aggressive judicial 
desegregation efforts — and exposure 
to minorities in general — often lead 
to ‘white flight’ from urban school 
districts.” It seems a clear limitation 
to integration is white people’s aver-
sion to diversity in their school dis-
tricts.
While we have yet to solve the 
aforementioned issue, we have an 
obligation to all citizens of the United 
States to reform the way we fund our 
public schools. Regardless of race, 
income or geography, all students 
should have the same amount of 
investment from the government in 
their futures. 
On average, a predominantly white 
district enrolls just over 1,500 stu-
dents compared to over 10,000 in 
non-white districts. A potential solu-
tion to this issue can be seen in the 
South, where “school district lines 
are often drawn along county lines, 
making districts larger across the 
board. Researchers found that fund-
ing looks more equal in states like 
Georgia and Alabama.”
According to EdBuild researchers, 
larger school districts would help bal-
ance out funding disparities, instead 
of arbitrary boundaries that favor 
keeping white and non-white students 
separated. Rebecca Sibilia, founder and 
CEO of EdBuild, said, “This confirms 
a theory that we’ve had, which is that 
the larger the tax base — the larger the 
actual geography of the school districts 
— the more you can actually balance 
out the difference between a wealthy 
white suburb and a less wealthy rural 
or urban area.”
Additionally, pooling together the 
local tax revenue and redistributing it 
equally would end the unfair system in 
place today. Of course, this would raise 
issues: The wealthier districts would 
likely see their funding drop. This 
would lead to inevitable backlash from 
the parents and teachers at wealthy 
schools. It seems the only plausible 
way this policy could be implemented 
would be with a large increase in state 
funding so that wealthier school dis-
tricts wouldn’t lose money. Everyone 
should demand increases in public 
school funding at the state level. Doing 
so will ensure that we invest the same 
amount in all kids, rich and poor.

018 was, globally, the fourth 
hottest 
year 
on 
record, 
surpassed only by 2016, 
2015 and 2017 in that order. In the 
United States alone, there were 
14 weather and climate caused 
billion-dollar disasters last year, 
and the cumulative cost of all these 
natural disasters was over $1.6 
trillion (for reference, that’s more 
than a twentieth of the U.S. GDP, 
and over twice as much as the U.S. 
annually spends on the military). 
Unfortunately though, this is just the 
tip of the iceberg.
Climate change is unlike any prob-
lem human civilization has faced 
before; it is a truly global crisis which 
impacts an incredibly diverse range 
of issues, from economic productiv-
ity to urban development to migra-
tion flows. However, efforts to solve 
climate change have thus far been 
derailed by a lack of binding inter-
national legislation and an amoral 
focus on short-term profit over the 
health of the planet. While the clock 
is ticking, there is time for humanity 
to right these wrongs by embracing 
a strong, cooperative approach to 
fighting climate change, and looking 
for the economic benefits, not draw-
backs, that come with it.
To begin, it’s important to con-
textualize how broad the effects of 
climate change are. One of the big-
gest effects of climate change, which 
is often an afterthought in discus-
sions of the issue, is global migra-
tion flows. In the past five years, 
the European Union’s struggle to 
handle a large influx of immigrants 
and refugees has already revealed 
how economically contentious and 
politically charged the issue of mass 
migration is. The EU’s controversial 
management of the situation has 
unfortunately contributed to the 
rise of far-right movements within 
Europe.
However, an increasingly warm 
and erratic global climate would only 
serve to drastically increase migra-
tion flows, in particular from devel-
oping nations in the global south. In 
2015, a Notre Dame study found that 
many countries in Central and Sub-
Saharan Africa are the most vulner-
able to climate change and the least 
prepared for it. Many do not have 
the money or resources to effec-
tively protect themselves. A report 
published by the European Council 
of Foreign Policy found that “The 
combination of poverty, dependence 
on agriculture, environmental deg-
radation, and population growth (in 
Africa) are creating a vicious circle, 
which can be expected to translate 

into increasing forced migration.” 
Here in the United States, the same 
issue is already occurring: Climate 
change has decimated the Guate-
malan farming industry, leaving 
individuals with little choice but to 
migrate to America.
The mass migration caused by 
climate change is problematic and 
highlights a fundamental prob-
lem with humanity’s handling of 
the issue. Even among developed 
nations that have acknowledged the 
dangers of climate change, there is 
no actual long-term plan in place 
for solving them. The Foreign Policy 
report explains that “The EU Emer-
gency Trust Fund for Africa is typi-
cal in focusing on enhancing border 
control and fighting smuggling, rath-
er than tackling the long term causes 
of migration.” This exemplifies the 
systemic unpreparedness countries 
have in regard to climate change, 
even when it touches on issues like 
immigration, which have already 
proven to be highly controversial. 

With that said, it’s time for the 
global community to finally take 
some bold steps towards fighting 
climate change. Historically, there is 
(some) precedent for binding global 
cooperation in fighting climate 
change. The primary example of 
this is The Montreal Protocol of 1987, 
which was a global agreement to 
ban the use of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) and other substances which 
depleted the Earth’s ozone layer. 
The treaty, with its concrete, specific 
restrictions was ratified by 197 coun-
tries. Two years later, at the Noord-
wijk Meeting in the Netherlands, the 
world came agonizingly close to cre-
ating a global framework for fighting 
climate change, except, as a Swed-
ish minister eloquently explained 
to American environmental activist 
Daniel Becker, “Your government is 
fucking this thing up!”
Since then, the global response 
to climate change has been a 
bevy of half-hearted treaties with 
high-minded language which are 
unenforceable, weak and largely 

ineffectual. The Paris climate agree-
ment, hailed as a groundbreaking 
treaty, “requires all Parties to put 
forward their best efforts through 
nationally 
determined 
contribu-
tions.” This type of open-ended 
requirement essentially leaves coun-
tries to do as they please, as exem-
plified by how the U.S. leaving the 
treaty didn’t seem to change any-
thing, on any level, with regard to 
fighting climate change.
While creating a binding treaty 
on such a broad issue is incredibly 
complex, there are a few aspects that 
are essential for effectively tackling 
climate change. Beyond the obvious 
requirements for a climate change 
treaty (promoting clean energy, 
finding ways to limit overall car-
bon emissions, etc.) there should 
be several other components. First, 
there needs to be some sort of finan-
cial incentive for countries to join; 
too often, countries ignore treaties 
they’ve agreed to follow if the agree-
ment is solely diplomatic. This could 
be as simple as creating a free trade 
agreement between member states, 
creating incentives for countries 
to join and cooperate. To go along 
with that, specific environmental 
goals on a country-by-country basis 
should be instituted. While the Paris 
climate agreement attempts to keep 
global warming below 2 degrees Cel-
sius, it has no specific requirements 
for individual nations, essentially 
absolving countries of their respon-
sibility to actually act.
Secondly, a good treaty would 
extol the economic benefits of fight-
ing 
climate 
change. 
Especially 
within the U.S., the political right 
has successfully created the narra-
tive that fighting climate change is 
economically infeasible or unwise 
(even as economic disasters caused 
by climate change cost the country 
trillions). A 2016 report found that 
Germany, by further promoting the 
use of renewable energy and globally 
cooperating with other countries 
doing the same, could reduce its car-
bon emissions from 72 to 93 percent 
by 2050 without harming economic 
growth. By justifying the economic 
benefits of fighting climate change, 
a global agreement could win over 
private enterprise, leading to greater 
investment in renewable energy and, 
subsequently, more innovation in 
the field.

The video game movie is a genre 
that precedes itself, and not for good 
reason. Video games are an inher-
ently interactive medium, and film 
is not; you do the math there. Part of 
the joy of playing video games is the 
ability to control something (in most 
cases, a character) and then have that 
something romp around the world 
of the game — in essence, a digital 
playground. Darting from Florence 
rooftop to rooftop as a Renaissance 
assassin is infinitely more fun than 
watching Michael Fassbender’s stunt 
double do the same in the “Assassin’s 
Creed” movie.
While some video games have 
compelling narratives and spec-
tacle the same as a movie — take 
the “Uncharted” series for example 
— most have a standard good ver-
sus evil plot that exists only to tie 
its characters to its world. You play 
“Street Fighter” to make Chun-Li 
kick the shit out of your friend’s 
fighter, not to obsess over cutscenes 
stitched together to make an (often 
poor) excuse for a story mode. 
Even returning to the example of 
“Uncharted,” the movie-like quality 
of which has attracted a Hollywood 
production, the whole point is that 
you’re basically playing a movie. 
Shoving it onto the silver screen 
makes it no different than your gar-

den-variety action blockbuster.
All these trappings of a video game 
movie were almost certain to set up 
“Pokémon Detective Pikachu” for 
failure. Battles between fantastical 
little creatures, the core mechanic of 
“Pokémon” games, function entirely 
on a turn-based system: One player 
acts while the other has to wait, 
and vice versa. This would be nigh 
impossible to port over to the real-
time nature of movies. Yet somehow, 
some way, “Detective Pikachu” man-
ages to capture not the mechanics of 
any “Pokémon” title, but the emo-
tional experience playing one elicits.
The best decision they made 
regarding 
“Detective 
Pikachu” 
was choosing not to adapt any plot 
already covered in the wider “Poké-
mon” universe — the anime has 
already done that to death. Instead, 
they took the fundamental principle 
of a low-profile spinoff game of the 
same name and ran with it. You have 
Pokémon, you have humans. They 
coexist. There’s a special Pikachu, 
he’s a detective. From just these blasé 
story elements, the film finds some-
thing special.
When I first saw the trailer for 
“Detective Pikachu,” I was very 
much put off by the realism of it all, 
the scary scaliness of movie Chariz-
ard clashing with the simply killer 
design of “Pokémon Red” that I fell 
in love with all those years ago. But 
actually seeing the movie and how 
it decided to bring these Pokémon 
to life (which are admittedly hor-
rifying; I mean, look at any Pokédex 
entry for a ‘mon that isn’t cute and 
cuddly and you’ll be met with tales 
of lost dead forest children turn-

ing into spirits) very much quelled 
that initial distaste. The more Poké-
mon that populated the screen, the 
more I thought, “Damn, they totally 
would be like that in real life.” You 
have something like Lickitung, a 
Pokémon with a constantly exposed 
tongue larger than its body, given 
a short scene where it makes use of 
that tongue, and then you realize it is 
fundamentally disgusting even as an 
8-bit sprite.
Even with the few frightening 
designs, it was an absolute treat to 
see these Pokémon scuttle, scamper 
and saunter in and around the cen-
tral location of Ryme City. Greninja 
was as ferocious as Bulbasaur was 
adorable. There’s even some great 
action scenes thrown in that stay 
grounded in the source material. I 
was transfixed by an underground 
battle between Blastoise and Gengar 
that saw the latter sending out a bar-
rage of familiar moves like Shadow 
Ball, warping ghastly around the 
arena as Blastoise spun around on its 
shell, using its water cannons to dis-
pel of the creepy Gengar clones.
“Detective Pikachu” does have 
its fair number of flaws. For every 
genuine emotion shared by the two 
lead characters, Tim (Justice Smith, 
“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) 
and Lucy (Kathryn Newton, “Block-
ers”), there’s a hamfisted line or reac-
tion right around the corner. Ryan 
Reynolds (“Deadpool 2”) fully invest-
ed himself in voice acting the titular 
role, but oftentimes the script puts 
a little too much stock in him, and 
his constant one-liners start to lose 
steam. However, for all the short-
comings on the human side of the 

film, the Pokémon more than make 
up for it.
I think the best review of “Poké-
mon Detective Pikachu” I can give is 
that I spent 90% of the movie point-
ing at the screen and giddily naming 
off all the various Pokémon I saw 
to my friends. “Emolga! Octillery! 
Rufflet!” I felt like a kid again, and I 
loved every second of it. It might be 
the most average movie, but “Poké-
mon Detective Pikachu” is the most 
fun moviegoing experience I’ve had 
in years.
— Cassandra Mansuetti
“Pokémon Detective Pikachu” is a 
great technical showpiece that proves 
— along with Disney’s “Beauty and 
the Beast” and “The Jungle Book” — 
another staple of millennial and Gen Z 
childhood can be brought to life on the 
big screen, even if the film’s plot struc-
ture leaves much to be desired.
In a post-“Sonic the Hedgehog”-
live-action-movie-trailer world, we 
can all breathe a sigh of relief in the 
comfort that comes with the com-
fort that comes from knowing they 
didn’t fall into the same trap of bad 
and unfaithful CGI. The Pokémon in 
“Pokémon” are great. They’re cute 
when they’re supposed to be cute, 
they’re tough when they’re supposed 
to be tough and all the time they’re 
as hilariously linguistically Hodored 
as we ever could have asked. There’s 
a lot to be happy with in this intro-
duction to a cinematic Pokémon uni-
verse, even if it does lean on modern 
storytelling tropes a little too pre-
dictably.
The escalation in the third act of 
“Detective Pikachu” is disappointing. 
The movie falls into the same trap 
that brought down the first “Fan-
tastic Beasts” movie — a transition 
away from a small, self-contained 
story about a few characters and their 
own personal quests, and toward a 
big blockbuster flick with world-end-
ing danger and city-saving heroics. 
“Detective Pikachu” was an interest-
ing, character-driven movie for about 
sixty minutes. Around that mark, it’s 
revealed that, for Tim to complete his 
personal mission of finding his father, 
he will have to defeat a villain that 
threatens the entire city (and ostensi-
bly the entire world when they wake 
up the next morning).
The ever-expanding plot arc of 
“Detective Pikachu” is now another 
example of big-studio cinematic uni-
verse-itus wilting away a perfectly 
good trio of characters when they 
force them to save the world. The 
advent of the MCU and its twenty-
something movies of fire and brim-
stone seem to have convinced us all 
that every movie’s plot has to put the 
fate of the world on the line. “Detec-
tive Pikachu”’s Ryme City is an 

engaging and vibrant enough world 
without the possibility of its total 
destruction. Characters can intro-
duce you to these worlds even if their 
task isn’t to save everyone’s day. The 
movie lost much of its interest when it 
decided that Tim’s character-driven 
arc, which had been guiding the plot 
up to that point, wasn’t enough any-
more.
These gripes aren’t all that rel-
evant, though, since “Detective Pika-
chu” is a movie aimed at giving kids a 
chance to see their favorite Japanese 
battle monsters come to life in the 
real world. The script wasn’t written 
to be a cinematic juggernaut — that 
wasn’t ever the filmmaker’s agenda 
— but I stand by the sentiment that 
a plot structured like that of “Detec-
tive Pikachu” is dangerous since it 
only further entrenches this idea that 
all films have to implicate the lives of 
everyone in the world to have a point.

Introducing a new generation of 
moviegoers to the big screen with 
flick after flick of down-and-out 
underdog facing off versus the all-
powerful essence of evil, hell-bent 
on destroying the world for what-
ever goddamn reason (probably 
because they love hell and darkness) 
maybe isn’t a good way to bring them 
into the cinema’s fold. It creates false 
expectations of what a satisfying 
story must be, and leads to further 
erosion of storytelling in the medi-
um. This isn’t a problem of “Detec-
tive Pikachu”’s making, and the film 
shouldn’t have to shoulder all of the 
blame. It’s a much larger industry 
issue. Hopefully, it’s one that will 
start to get addressed now that we 
are in and out of the “Endgame.”
In the end, “Pokémon Detec-
tive Pikachu” delivers on a lot of 
what anyone could want from a 
Pokémon movie. It’s a great way to 
spend an hour and forty-five for a 
family movie night, and it should 
succeed because of it. It’s a shame 
Danny Devito never got tapped up 
for the role of the man behind the 
little yellow rat, but what are you 
going to do?

Despite the countless positives 
associated with the recent surge 
in representation within our 
media landscape, it is easy to be 
lulled into a false sense of accom-
plishment. The mere presence of 
diverse faces does not mean that 
the seemingly never-ending jour-
ney toward parity has been com-
pleted. 
That’s right, whites. Put your 
pussy hats back on, this party’s 
far from being over. Currently, 
to be a person of color with a 
platform in the media, your vis-
ibility comes at the cost of your 
individualism. The beast of fame 
is indiscriminate in its scrutiny 
of those in the public eye, but 
only those from marginalized 
groups know the fatiguing extent 
to which their identities amplify 
this magnification. In the same 
way that the only Black kid in 
class is expected to retain a doc-
torate in American slavery by 
middle school, creators of color 
are expected to use their projects 
to speak for an entire community. 
Part of this stems from a long-
standing legacy of underrepre-
sentation. When a people has 
been deprived of representation 
for — well — forever, each starved 
member has ample time to dream 
up their own unique expectations 

that one show cannot possibly 
satisfy. This pattern also stems 
from the long-established nor-
malization of the privileged, and 
the resultant “othering” of every-
one who does not meet a certain 
criterion. Even shows featuring 
niche sects within privileged 
groups, take Irish Catholics for 
instance, 
avoid 
the 
expecta-
tion to speak for all members of 
the 
community. 
This is because, 
as Ramy Youssef 
(“Mr. Robot”), cre-
ator of a new, self-
titled Hulu show, 
 
pointed out in his 
group 
interview 
with The Michi-
gan Daily, privi-
leged groups have 
historically 
been 
afforded the right 
to nuance. Mar-
ginalized groups? 
Not so much. 
Ramy Youssef is 
out to combat this 
norm. 
To 
the 
untrained 
eye, 
“Ramy” 
appears 
to be yet another vehicle for a 
stand-up comedian too lazy to 
think up a title for a show loosely 
based on themselves. There’s 
been 
“Seinfeld,” 
“Roseanne,” 
“Ellen” and even (yes, I’m bring-
ing it up) “Mulaney.” Only this 

time, the old trick comes with a 
layer of complexity unfounded 
in its predecessors: “I think it’s 
really important to have people 
authentically being themselves. 
And I think, for me, my approach 
in calling the show ‘Ramy’ was 
to highlight from the beginning 
that this is just one Arab-Muslim 
story.” 
In developing “Ramy,” Youssef 
made it his mis-
sion to create a 
show with subtle-
ties usually only 
reserved for white, 
presumably Chris-
tian characters. In 
doing so, he has 
forged a path for 
future creators of 
color who dream 
of 
a 
day 
when 
their 
identities 
can be present in 
their work with-
out overshadowing 
the actual story, or 
at the very least, 
express 
them-
selves 
in 
their 
work without the 
constant 
anxiety 
of appeasing everyone within a 
community. 
Produced by A24, “Ramy” 
is now kin to some of the most 
talked-about coming-of-age sto-
ries of recent years: “Lady Bird,” 
“mid90s,” “Eighth Grade,” the 

list goes on. Although this is 
exceptional company to be in, 
I had to wonder, in addition to 
centering on an Arab-American 
man, how else does “Ramy” dis-
tinguish itself as a narrative 
from the seemingly never-ending 
stream of projects falling under 
the category of Confused Mil-
lennial Finding Him/Her/Their 
selves™? Youssef’s answer was 
unexpected to say the least. And 
not just because genteel women 
never discuss it during dinner. 
Religion. 
Make no mistake — Youssef, 
dressed as though 
he could have just 
clocked out from 
a long day at VICE 
News, is not out to 
convert the masses 
or spread the word 
of how “cool” reli-
gion can be like 
a 
cargo 
short-
clad youth group 
leader. His aim in 
emphasizing reli-
gion in his passion 
project is merely 
to shed a light on 
the crossroads he 
has been met with 
throughout 
his 
life in attempting 
to own his faith 
while willingly participating in 
aspects of secularity.
While most comedies geared 
towards the coveted 18-34 demo-
graphic evade discussing religion 
in an earnest way and feature 
characters 
either 
ambivalent 
toward or outwardly disinterest-
ed in any element of faith, “Ramy” 
attempts to bridge this divide by 
crafting a nuanced depiction of 
a man who is not attempting to 
escape his religion and culture, 
but, on the contrary, to “be his 
best spiritual self.” A distinction 
that is on display from the onset 
of the series, in the first episode 
alone, fictional Ramy Hassan 
must have an awkward conver-
sation with his hookup regard-
ing her misconceptions about his 
faith. She assumed he was “cul-
turally Muslim” in the same way 
that she was “culturally Jewish.” 
She was incorrect. I couldn’t help 
but picture the scene as a meta 
exchange between Youssef him-
self and other popular coming-
of-age comedies of today. 
Comedy 
and 
religion 
are 
an odd couple of sorts — with 
their only successful merger to 
date being the archaic setup for 
jokes about a rabbi and a priest 
inexplicably sharing a drink at 

Applebee’s. Youssef is not blind 
to this reality, reasoning that, 
“church, the mosque, the temple 
… whatever are almost always the 
punchline.” As much as I like to 
perceive millennials and Gen-
eration Z as a hold-no-punches 
bunch, shying away from no topic 
too taboo, I had to wrangle with 
the possibility that maybe we did 
avoid religion like Christmas Eve 
mass. Just because I am a disil-
lusioned Catholic (read: only 
stuck around for the wine, then 
bounced), does that mean that I 
cannot appreciate a show about 
someone 
else’s 
relationship 
to 
their 
faith? 
My 
fear in beginning 
Youssef’s 
series 
with this in mind 
was that it would 
be 
akin 
to 
the 
Christian 
movies 
they showed at my 
Catholic 
middle 
school: 
preachy, 
poorly acted and 
(maybe?) with an 
arc related to high 
school football.
It would be an 
understatement 
to say that this 
is not “Ramy” in 
the slightest. No 
spoilers: There’s a condom full 
of water, a cringe-inducing car 
makeout and hookah. There are 
clearer traces of “Atlanta” inher-
ent in “Ramy” than the Catho-
lic school staple, “Facing the 
Giants.”
Rather than being a hindrance 
to 
my 
enjoyment, 
Youssef’s 
exploration 
of 
religion 
pro-
vided for a compelling internal 
struggle that was refreshing to 
see. In discussing the possibility 
of renewal by Hulu, Ramy and 
co-star Dave Merheje (“Mr. D”) 
both expressed high hopes for a 
second season. With commercial 
and critical praise continuing to 
pour in for the show, this appears 
to be a very plausible matter. And 
for Youssef, who was credited 
with penning about half of the 
first season’s episodes, he shows 
no signs of writer’s block: “The 
importance [of “Ramy”] lies in 
that we get to highlight that you 
can be very specific and do ten 
episodes in a season and there’s 
still so much that hasn’t been

anything that is important about 
(this), it’s that. We get to high-

a wealth of story and probably 
profitable too.”

Starting in late 2018, Ann Arbor 
residents have grown increasingly 
concerned 
about 
dioxane 
and 
PFAS contamination in Washtenaw 

County’s drinking water. With Ann 
Arbor residents calling for a more 
transparent reporting system, Ann 
Arbor Water Treatment Manager 
Brian Steglitz released a plan to 
publish 
updated 
water 
quality 
newsletters every month.
Because 
May 
is 
“Water 
Awareness 
Month,” 
Steglitz 
published 
the 
initial 
issue 
of 

“A2H20” on the first of the month. 
To further inform residents about 
water quality, city officials also 
added a page to their website with 
the monthly report, information 
about fire hydrant flushing and 
water rate changes.
In the report, Steglitz mentioned 
dioxane and PFAS infiltration are 
not a new phenomenon.

“Dealing 
with 
water 
contaminants is not new to us,” 
Steglitz wrote. “Throughout my 
tenure of almost 22 years, and in 
the decades preceding, the city 
has successfully addressed and 
overcome several water quality 
challenges.”
In an email to The Daily, Daniel 
Brown, Huron River Watershed 
Council planner, referenced the 
ongoing water crisis in Flint. Now 
more than ever, he suggested, there 
is a need for transparency regarding 
the current state of Ann Arbor’s 
water.
“Post-Flint, it is clear utilities 
need to be proactive in providing 
customers 
with 
as 
much 
information as possible,” Brown 
wrote. “PFAS and 1,4 dioxane 
contamination concerns add to the 
urgency of that messaging in Ann 
Arbor specifically.”
Breeches in 1,4 dioxane — 
classified by the EPA as a likely 
carcinogen — have been an ongoing 
problem in Ann Arbor for over a 
decade. In a 2001 press release, 
Sue 
McCormick, 
former 
Ann 
Arbor Water Utility director, said 
the city found trace amounts of 
dioxane in the water supply during 
a routine test. Now, according to 
the first newsletter published by 
Steglitz, dioxane is at .029 parts per 
trillion (ppt), which is considered 
undetected.
Last summer the Department 
of Environmental Quality found 
traces of PFAS around the state, 

including in the Huron River. Even 
at low levels, consumption of PFAS 
chemicals can lead to a multitude 
of health problems such as a 
higher risk of cancer, a weakened 
immune system and child growth 
impairments. Since 2016, PFAS 
levels in Ann Arbor’s water have 
continued to rise. 
There are 36 confirmed PFAS 
sites in Michigan, according to the 
Michigan Environmental Council. 
However, the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality believes 
there could be over 11,300 locations 
statewide could be contaminated.
Since 
then, 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer has proposed a PFAS water 
drinking standard to be implemented 
by July 1, 2019. U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Ann 
Arbor, 
echoed 
support for Whitmer’s proposal, 
calling again for the Environmental 
Protection Agency to set a national 
maximum contaminant level for 
all PFAS compounds and distribute 
funds to all contaminated sites.
According to MLive, there was a 
significant spike in PFAS levels in 
Ann Arbor’s water this past March 
reaching up to 41.7 ppt.
However, Lisa Wondrash, Ann 
Arbor 
communications 
director, 
said she wouldn’t consider these past 
three months’ PFAS levels — which 
were all around 4 ppt — to be a spike 
as the water drinking quality goal is 
set at 10 ppt.

Recently, Jordan Peele, direc-
tor of the hit movies “Get Out” 
and “Us,” got a lot of attention 
for saying that he plans on con-
tinuing his pattern of casting 
Black people for his leads. He 
goes on to say that he has noth-
ing against white guys, but won’t 
use them in his films because he 
has “already seen that movie.” 
When I saw somebody post his 
words on Instagram the other 
day, I was shocked that he was 
so blunt about his decisions, but 
also glad that someone powerful 
in the entertainment industry is 
dedicated to opening the door 
for Black representation.
When I read through the com-
ments, the reviews were mixed. 
There were some who were 
against his words, (arguing the 
typical “but if someone of a dif-
ferent race said this, it would be 
seen as racist) while there were 
some who appreciated his stance 
in the same way I did. The com-
ment that struck me the most 
was when someone went on to 
say that his Peele’s comment 
and subsequent actions were 
no problem because Tyler Perry 
has been doing the same thing 
for years. In this context, they 
were right. However, in general, 
I wouldn’t even think to equate 
the two. In my mind, Jordan 
Peele is no Tyler Perry. And the 
proof is in what they produce.
Almost every prominent art-
ists has trademark aspects of 
their works. Peele’s is social sat-
ire and elements of suspense/
thrill. Perry’s, on the other hand, 
is baby mama drama, unfaithful 
partners with STDs and domes-

tic violence. Now don’t get me 
wrong, I’ve enjoyed my fair 
share of Tyler Perry movies and 
sitcoms (I used to watch “Meet 
the Browns” very faithfully). 
I also get that these stories are 
real for some people, and they 
deserve to be told. However, it 
is pretty obvious the different 
manners in which these power-
ful men have chosen to regularly 
represent the Black community.

This is something that hs 
actually 
started 
to 
disgrace 
Tyler Perry in recent years. For 
decades now, Black people have 
been typecast into negative por-
trayals. Most of the roles we are 
set to play are either characters 
that are a personified version of 
our stereotypes, some kind of 
villain, or an irrelevant sidekick. 
The only exception to this is 
when we are slaves. So it’s start-

ing to rub people the wrong way 
(myself included) that this Black 
man with a multi-million dollar 
platform is using it to reiterate 
demeaning images. And these 
images continue to impact how 
we are seen on the screen, but 
also how we are perceived in 
real life. I understand that his 
extremely successful platform 
wouldn’t exist in the first place 
without the type of work media 
that he creates. However, many 
artists change their tune after 
accumulating 
enough 
main-
stream success. For example, 
Beyoné played it safe for so many 
years. But when she became a 
bonafide and irreplaceable icon, 
her music started to showcase 
her as one of the most overt-
ly pro-Black musicians in the 
industry today. Perry has/had 
the option to do this, but he 
hasn’t.
Peele, on the other hand, 
has built his empire by casting 
Black people in more unique and 
inspiring roles. He puts them in 
positions that include charac-
ter development and relatabil-
ity. You go through the movie 
actually rooting for somebody. 
His films have introduced Black 
people into new roles and new 
genres. He entertains his audi-
ence without having to bounce 
around in a dress.
Tyler Perry’s works definitely 
have a time and a place. They 
definitely serve as a good source 
of 
entertainment 
sometimes. 
However, with Perry being one 
of the only Black directors in 
Hollywood, I needed a break 
from the typical. And that’s 
what Peele is.
To me, it is obvious that Jor-
dan Peele is no Tyler Perry. And 
to be quite honest, I’m glad.

Michigan to host NCAA Tournament regional round at home

Two weeks ago, it seemed out 
of the cards. But after a pair of 
massive dominoes fell into place, 
the Michigan softball team was 
selected as one of the 16 host sites 
for the four-team regional round 
of the 2019 NCAA Tournament.
Heading 
into 
the 
final 
weekend of conference play, the 
Wolverines found themselves one 
game behind Northwestern in 
the Big Ten standings. With the 
help of third-place Minnesota’s 
series win over the Wildcats, 
Michigan 
used 
a 
sweep 
of 
Maryland to clinch the outright 
regular season conference title.
On 
Saturday, 
the 
team 
captured 
its 
10th 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
championship 
in 
program 
history 
with 
a 
thrilling win over the three-time 

defending 
champion 
Golden 
Gophers to sweep the Big Ten 
titles.
“(Hosting a regional) is the 
goal,” said coach Carol Hutchins 
on Apr. 28. “To be honest, it’s the 
number one goal of all the goals 
we have. Don’t get me wrong, 
championships are great, but to 
host the regional and be a seeded 
team would be a tribute to this 
senior class … It would be really 
special.”
On Sunday night, Hutchins 
and the 15th-seeded Wolverines 
achieved their goal. Following 
two 
weeks 
of 
uncertainty, 
Michigan seniors Faith Canfield 
(.418 batting average), Natalie 
Peters 
(.358), 
Alex 
Sobczak 
(.336), Mackenzie Nemitz (.288) 
and Katie Alexander (.280) will 
in fact have their “tribute,” as 
Hutchins put it. Each senior is 
a member of the team’s starting 
lineup.

The Wolverines will welcome 
St. Francis (PA), James Madison 
and DePaul to Alumni Field this 
coming weekend. On Friday, 
Michigan will take on St. Francis 
while James Madison squares off 
against DePaul in the first leg of 
the double-elimination round. 
The winner of the Ann Arbor 
regional will face the winner of 
the Los Angeles regional, hosted 
by No. 2 seed UCLA, in next 
weekend’s super regional.
If the Wolverines and the 
Dukes both advance, Saturday 
will 
present 
an 
opportunity 
for Michigan to avenge one of 
its five non-conference losses 
against ranked opponents. On 
March 7, then-No. 21 James 
Madison downed the Wolverines 
in nine innings at the Arizona 
State Invitational.
Now, Michigan will host 
the regional round for the 
first 
time 
since 
2016. 

That 
year, 
the 
momentum 
of 
sweeping 
the 
regional 
propelled 
the 
program 
to 
the Women’s College World 
Series.

If 
Hutchins 
and 
the 
Wolverines are searching for 
one more tribute, there wouldn’t 
be anything more fitting than 
returning to Oklahoma City.

DANIEL DASH
Daily Sports Writer

ALEC COHEN/Daily
The Michigan softball team won the Big Ten Tournament and will host a regional.

Warde Manuel has been here 
before.
In 2012, as athletic director at 
Connecticut, 
he 
oversaw 
the 
men’s 
basketball 
program’s 
transition from 
retiring Hall of 
Fame coach Jim 
Calhoun to the 
hiring of Kevin 
Ollie. And just 
two years ago, 
as 
Michigan’s 
athletic director, Manuel appointed 
Mel Pearson to assume reigns of the 
Michigan hockey team, succeeding 
legendary coach Red Berenson.

John Beilein’s announcement 
Monday morning to leave the 
Michigan men’s basketball program 
and coach the NBA’s Cleveland 
Cavaliers means Manuel is faced 
with a similar task once again. 
But this will by far be the biggest 
decision during his tenure in Ann 
Arbor — and possibly his career.
“My priority now is to commence 
a full national search for our next 
basketball coach,” Manuel said in a 
statement.
How does one replace the all-
time winningest and greatest men’s 
basketball coach in school history?
At Monday’s Big Ten meetings, 
Manuel acknowledged he prepared 
for this moment since Beilein was 
in talks with the Detroit Pistons 

last year. Knowing the coach’s 
possibility to ascend to the pro 
ranks despite a virtual lifetime 
contract signed last summer, a 
shortlist of candidates has been at 
the ready.
It’s what Manuel does with this 
shortlist, and the results which 
stem from the impending decision, 
that will define his career at 
Michigan.
Coaching changes are never 
easy, but Manuel’s track record 
demonstrates nothing but smooth 
transitions — and fast success. 
Two years after Ollie arrived, 
the 
Huskies 
won 
a 
national 
championship. Their first season 
under Pearson, the Wolverines 
advanced to the Frozen Four.
But this one is different. This 
is a change from a coach with no 
connection to any semblance of 
foul play or scandal, a coach who 
excelled in player development and 
a coach who, over the past 12 years, 
redefined 
Michigan 
basketball 
and made it, once again, a top-tier 
program nationally.
This decision is unlike the others 
where 
quick 
accomplishments 
represent the greatest litmus test 
for a positive replacement. This 
outlines the future of the program, 
one that can enter an era of 
rebuilding or continue to produce 
winning seasons year in and year 
out with Sweet Sixteen appearances 

essentially the norm. This is one 
that needs to steady a ship that has 
now entered unchartered waters, 
its captain gone from the helm.
“The way he’s carried himself 
with class and dignity and doing 
things the right way, I’m just so 
proud to work with him and to 
have him at Michigan,” Manuel 
said minutes after the Wolverines 
clinched their sixth Final Four 
berth in 2018. “John is the stability 
of what we’ve been doing in 
basketball for the last decade and 
we didn’t have this kind of success 
consistently until John came.
“For me, I couldn’t ask for a 
better person.”
Now begins the search for a 
successor, one who can fill Beilein’s 
enormous shoes and maintain a 
high level of excellence expected 
by the athletic department and fan 
base alike.
Should Michigan hire from 
within or look outside the program? 
How will this affect current players 
potentially transferring or assistant 
coaches possibly departing? Will 
this hurt recruiting in the long run?
The announcement is still fresh, 
but questions have already been 
raised and will continue to be 
obsessed as Manuel contemplates 
the choice in front of him. The 
rumor mill of potential Beilein 
replacements has already been at 
work with Butler’s LaVall Jordan, 

Texas Tech’s Chris Beard and 
Miami Heat assistant and Fab Five 
member Juwan Howard thrown 
into the mix. On top of that, Manuel 
said Monday he has received 
multiple calls from those with 
interest in the coveted vacancy.
The timeframe for the decision?
“The timeline is I want to get 
it right,” Manuel said Monday. 
“While I’d like it to be done ASAP, 
I’m also going to take the time to 
make sure that we find the right 
person for Michigan.”
In the following weeks, Manuel, 
along with Turnkey Search, will 
conduct interviews and eventually 
name the 17th head coach of the 
Michigan men’s basketball team. 
The so-called “culture driver” in 
Beilein has left for Cleveland and 
it’s up to Manuel, in his biggest 
move yet, to get to vetting and 
selecting a replacement who will 
also leave an indelible mark in Ann 
Arbor.
Warde Manuel has been here 
before. But unlike with Ollie 
and Pearson and any other past 
appointments, this move changes 
the trajectory of an elite Michigan 
basketball program for years to 
come — and cements Manuel’s 
legacy as athletic director, for 
better or worse.

Warde Manuel’s career-defining decision 

BENJAMIN
KATZ


Last 
summer, 
Beilein 
was 
reportedly in talks to become the 
coach of the Detroit Pistons, but 
decided to remain at Michigan. 
In July, he signed a contract 
extension through 2023, with a 
rollover clause that would keep 
him in Ann Arbor as long as both 
sides desired.
However, this time around, the 
Cavaliers were too enticing to pass 
up. According to Wojnarowski, 
Beliein had become frustrated 
with 
the 
world 
of 
college 
basketball recruiting and the 
nature of top teams losing their 
players year after year. Beilein 
was also an appealing choice to 
NBA teams for the work he did 
rebuilding the Wolverines into a 

top national contender after years 
mired in mediocrity.
“We could not be more thrilled 
to name John Beilein as the new 
coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers,” 
Gilbert said in a statement. “First, 
John is a great human being. He 
cares deeply about his players 
and others who work for him and 
around him. He defines the words 
class, integrity and character. He 
is a tireless worker who obsesses 
about finding better ways and 
the inches that will help his team 
and the organization grow. John 
is a brilliant basketball mind and 
last but not least, John Beilein 
is a winner. I also want to thank 
Koby and his hardworking staff 
for turning over every rock while 
relentlessly searching for our new 
head coach since the minute this 
past season ended. It is no surprise 
that Koby and his team landed 
on John Beilein as great cultures 

attract others 
who hold the 
same values as the foundation for 
everything they do. I can’t wait 
for next season to begin.”
Staying in Cleveland will also 
allow Beilein to stay relatively 
close to home, as well as just a few 
hours drive to his son Patrick, who 
is now the coach of Niagara.
In a statement released Monday 
afternoon, athletic director Warde 
Manuel thanked Beilein for his time 
at the University and said that he 
would commence a national search 
for the next coach. Michigan hired 
the search firm Turnkey Search — 
the same firm it used to hire Manuel 
in 2016 — according to the Detroit 
Free Press. 
“I was saddened when John told 
me this morning of his decision to 
leave Michigan for a head coaching 
position in the NBA. However, I am 
incredibly thankful for his 12 years 
of service to this university,” said 

Manuel. “Above and beyond being 
our all-time winningest coach, 
John is a tremendous role model 
for the game of college basketball. 
He is an outstanding educator, 

community member and a man of 
great integrity, and he and Kathleen 
will be missed. My priority now is 
to commence a full national search 
for our next basketball coach.”

As Beilein leaves, an unmistakable legacy is left in his wake

The last time the Michigan had to 
replace its head coach, the program 
was unrecognizable to those familiar 
with the current Wolverines.
Michigan in 2007 had barely 
scraped relevance since the breakup 
of the Fab Five in 1993. It hadn’t 
made the NCAA Tournament since 
1998 — an appearance later vacated 
by NCAA sanctions. It lived under 
the shadow of the football team and 
a group of recruits who had since 
been banned from the program.
CJ Lee, a Michigan guard from 
2006-09 and current director of 
program 
personnel, 
was 
there 
when then-coach Tommy Amaker 
was fired. Even with Amaker’s 
uninspiring record, his firing still 
incited some disappointment. After 
all, he had helped drag the program 
out of its sanction-induced low point 
in the early 2000s.
Lee, though, knew the Wolverines 
were getting someone good in 
John Beilein. Lee went to high 
school in western New York, where 
Beilein recruited some of his AAU 
teammates and had seen Beilein’s 
success at West Virginia. The Beilein 
he knew of back then was a coach 
who ran a unique offense and a 1-3-1 
zone, a coach with a good reputation 
but questions about whether he 
could stick at a high-major program 
like Michigan.
Twelve years later, when Beilein 

left the Wolverines to take the helm of 
the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday 
morning, he was a coach who still 
ran a unique offense, albeit one of a 
different vein, but had ditched the 
zone — and ditched control over 
his defense, hiring assistants with 
greater expertise in the area. He 
was a coach whose reputation had 
exploded, who hadn’t just succeeded 
at a high-major program but taken 
it from no-man’s-land to consistent 
contender. He was a coach who had 
become, in some ways, impossible to 
replace — the unenviable task that 
now falls on the shoulders of athletic 
director Warde Manuel.
“The first couple years, people 
were kinda wondering, does (Beilein) 
have what it takes?” Lee told The 
Daily. “And it just shows that his 
ability to morph, his ability to adapt, 
his ability to change, his ability to 
figure out that place and figure out 
his way of doing things here — it was 
incredible. And it worked.”
Beilein got Michigan back to the 
NCAA Tournament in his second 
year, and the Wolverines have made 
it in eight of the past nine years — 
with five Sweet Sixteens and two 
appearances in the national title 
game. His performance surpassed 
even 
what 
could 
have 
been 
considered the best-case scenario.
“It goes without saying, he 
brought Michigan basketball back to 
prominence,” Lee said. “I would say 
he restored the image in the hearts 
and minds of a lot of people, probably 
in the court of public opinion. 
Certainly, coach Amaker did a great 

job in his time, coming out of the 
sanctions, and then coach Beilein 
took it to a level where you’re back in 
the Final Four.”
Zack Novak, a Michigan guard 
from 2008-12, joined the program 
in Beilein’s early days. Back then, 
the team was filled with Amaker 
holdovers, and Beilein was tasked 
with not only developing his young 
players, but getting buy-in from his 
older ones — a test he passed with 
flying colors. Then, he began to build 
the foundation of the Wolverines’ 
new 
identity. 
Novak 
saw 
the 
beginning of that foundation, with 
Michigan’s 
NCAA 
Tournament 
appearance in 2009. By the time he 
left in 2012 — with a Big Ten regular-
season title and a No. 4 seed in the 
tournament — he saw a program that 
finally stood on solid ground.
“From day one, when coach 
starting recruiting me, the first 
step was, get back to the NCAA 
Tournament,” Novak told The Daily 
on April 13. “But he was very firm 
that Michigan should be a premier 
program and we needed to build the 
foundation to get back to where it 
should be. And so, I think from day 
one, he had a vision and he had his 
guys that bought into the vision.
“And I think you gotta give credit 
to a lot of the guys who came from 
coach Amaker, who rolled over. Kind 
of a difficult situation, right? Two 
very different styles of playing. And 
those guys easily could have been 
cancers on the team and not bought 
into the vision, and instead they did 
the opposite. 
And 
really 

set the foundation for what was to 
come. Now, with that being said, 
I’m not gonna lie to you and say that 
I thought we’d be in two national 
title games in the next 10 years. I 
think it’s gone a bit beyond what the 
original vision was.”
From 
there, 
Beilein 
built 
Michigan into what it is now, all with 
the perception that he runs a clean 
program. Beilein is one of the few 
high-major coaches who is widely 
believed not to cheat. He instilled his 
values in every player, from Lee and 
Novak until now. Former Michigan 
sports information director Bruce 
Madej 
remembered 
Beilein 
as 
someone who always talked about 
family and community. Even as 
Beilein began to crave the greater 
challenge that the NBA would 
bring, that community was what the 
Wolverines were to him.
In a way, the NBA is a culmination 
for Beilein. This is someone who has 
never held a permanent position as 
an assistant coach, instead climbing 
the ladder from high school JV to 
community college to Division II to 
mid-major to Michigan. Professional 
basketball was the one step he had 
never taken.
“What has happened to John 
Beilein in his life and in his coaching 
career has been miraculous, it’s 
really been magical,” said Jeff 
Neubauer, the current Fordham 
coach and a former Beilein assistant 
at Richmond and West Virginia 
from 1996-2005. “... Who he has 
been throughout his life is to take on 
a massive challenge — most of them 

were places where people didn’t 
think he could succeed. So he’s gone 
to different schools throughout his 
career and done amazing things 
over and over. So my speculation 
would be that this is his opportunity 
to take on another huge challenge, 
climb another mountain.”
Now, Beilein is firmly entrenched 
as a Michigan legend. No matter who 
you talk to, former players, assistants 
and people around the program have 
nary a bad word to say about him — 
as a person or a coach.
And regardless of what the 
future holds, Beilein will always 
be remembered as the coach who 
brought Michigan back to soaring 
heights, the coach who firmly 
implanted a new culture and the 
coach who did things the right way 
— in every sense of the word.
“I tell people all the time when 
they ask me about playing for, 
working for coach Beilein, is that as 
good of a basketball coach as he is, 
he’s a better person,” Lee said. “And 
I think that, over the last 12 years, 
the fan base and college basketball 
in general has got to witness an 
incredible, incredible human being 
who happens to be a basketball 
coach on the sidelines, in Ann Arbor.
“And I really hope that they 
cherish that. I hope they recognize 
how special that is to have the 
human being, the coach, the man, 
the success. How rare that is, for it all 
to come together like that. So I just 
hope that people are appreciative 
and he is honored for his time, 
because he did a tremendous job.”
