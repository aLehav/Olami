Making a splash

Researchers could 
contribute to future 
travels to the planet

For the Daily

NASA recently funded a 

University of Michigan design 
for spacecraft thrusters as part 
of its Next Space Technologies 
for Exploration Partnerships 
(NextSTEP). The NextSTEP 
program encompasses various 
projects, all aimed at bringing 
humans closer to manned 
missions to Mars.

The project at the University 

is led by Aerospace Engineering 
Prof. Alec Gallimore, who was 
named the next Engineering 
dean Thursday.

His design, called the X3, 

is the thruster component of a 
larger propulsion system called 
the XR-100, which is the project 
of major aerospace engineering 
firm Aerojet Rocketdyne. NASA 
awarded $6.5 million to Aerojet 
Rocketdyne for the XR-100, $1 
million of which has been given 
for work on the X3 thruster

On Friday, a group of panelists 

from Flint, Detroit, Highland 
Park and Muskegon Heights 
spoke at the University to discuss 
water access and management in 

communities of color as part of an 
event for Black Heritage Month.

Each panelist had a different 

expertise 
including 
research, 

science, political and activist 
backgrounds. All of the panelists 
agreed, however, that water is 
a public good that should be 
available for every person to 
access.

Leon 
Howard, 
program 

manager in the Office of Multi-
Ethnic 
Student 
Affairs 
and 

moderator of the event, said the 
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs wanted this event to 

address concerns about water 
access in communities of color and 
to delve into why the management 
of water has tremendous impacts 
on communities.

“We wanted to do a panel 

focused on water access and 
management in communities of 
color because of what was going 
on in Flint and other places across 
the state when it comes to being 
able to access safe water,” he said.

One of the topics of the panel 

was the ongoing effect of water 
crises

Wolverines keep 
intensity up all 
week, hold off 

Indiana for victory

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

Saturday night, in a unified 

leap, the Michigan women’s 
swimmers, 
divers, 
coaches, 

trainers, 
and 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championship trophy splashed 
into 
the 
pool 
at 
Canham 

Natatorium, 
capping 
off 
a 

victory years in the making. 
Over the course of the four-
day Big Ten Championship 
meet, the Wolverines beat out 
the 12 other Big Ten teams and 
claimed their first Big Ten title 
since 2004. 

“The only way to put that 

in words is to cry for joy,” said 
Michigan coach Mike Bottom.

The Wolverines dominated 

the meet, leading from the 
second 
day 
on. 
After 
the 

100-yard freestyle, in which 
freshman Siobhán Haughey set 
a pool record with a time of 47.71 

and senior captain Ali DeLoof 
finished third, the meet was all 
but over. And after the 200-yard 
butterfly, with two events still 
remaining, the Wolverines had 
put themselves out of the reach 
of second-place Indiana, the 
only team within 400 points of 
the Wolverines. 

However, 
DeLoof 
didn’t 

always know that Michigan 
would accomplish this much. 
Three years ago, DeLoof was a 
freshman struggling through 
weeks of 20 hours of practice 
in the pool. It was Bottom’s first 
year with the program, and the 
team finished sixth in the Big 
Ten. DeLoof helped the team 
to improve over the next two 
years — placing fifth in the Big 
Ten in 2014 and third in 2015 — 
but taking the next step was still 
somewhere in the distance for 
the Wolverines. 

“We imagined it at the 

beginning of the year, but it was 
always just a possibility,” said 
sophomore Clara Smiddy.

Even just a few days ago, 

DeLoof — who was named first-
team All-Big Ten on Saturday 
— didn’t know if she would be 

Residents discuss 
frustration with 

government, burden

Daily Staff Reporter

As national media attention 

and 
a 
state 
and 
federal 

declarations of emergency over 

Flint’s water crisis draw eyes to 
the city’s community, residents 
are tasked with continuing to 
live within the city’s bounds, 
feeling the crisis’ effects.

On 
a 
Friday 
afternoon, 

Saginaw Street — the city’s 
main drag — is quiet, with 
several residents walking into 
the restaurants and shops that 
have survived the economic 
hardships that have plagued the 
area since the closing of a nearby 
General Motors plant almost 

seventeen years ago.

On the University of Michigan-

Flint campus, a few students 
linger in the Harding Mott 
University Center watching T.V. 
on communal screens, eating or 
paging through thick textbooks. 
 

Signs around campus tell 

students the water is OK and safe 
for them to drink. Students rely 
on state-issued purifiers on each 
faucet and drinking fountain to 
protect them from any possible 
lead in the city’s water supply 

while on campus.

Cody Worswick, a sophomore 

computer science major from 
Marysville, Michigan considers 
himself 
fortunate. 
Before 

enrolling at the University’s 
Flint campus, his mother was 
aware of the dangerous water 
quality within the city’s limits, 
he said, and bought him a filter, 
which he uses for all of his 
drinking water.

Worswich said he doesn’t 

After FOIA, body 
has data but must 
wait for University 

approval

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

LSA senior Cooper Charlton, 

Central Student Government 
president, said Sunday that 
course evaluation data could be 
released for student use as early 
as fall 2016.

The organization has gained 

the data from a Freedom of 
Information 
Act 
request, 

Charlton said, but cannot release 
it until it secures approval from 
the Provost’s office.

CSG has been advocating for 

the release of course evaluations 
since Charlton’s party, Make 
Michigan, took office this fall. 
Charlton said two committees 
led by Sean Pitt, LSA junior and 
CSG chief of staff, and Anushka 
Sarkar, LSA junior and CSG 

chief programming officer, have 
submitted reports to the office 
of the Provost regarding the 
construction of a new course 
evaluation instrument and a 
new release policy. If approved, 
the University of Michigan will 
release the course evaluation 
data.

This is the first time CSG 

has submitted a FOIA request 
for course evaluations since 
2011, according to Pitt. He 
wrote in an e-mail that the 
recommendations 
formed 

by the committees will be 
considered by the University in 
determining what information 
will be collected and released 
from course evaluations, and are 
not directly related to the FOIA 
request.

In 
2011 
and 
prior, 
the 

Michigan 
Student 
Assembly, 

now known as CSG, regularly 
filed Freedom of Information 
requests 
to 
release 
course 

evaluation data for a course 
selection advice site. Pitt said 
though these efforts have fallen

by the wayside in past years, 
the 
current 
assembly’s 
two 

committees have put a particular 
emphasis on obtaining this data 
again. 

However, the push to release 

the data has sparked concerns 
on campus, namely from faculty, 
over potential biases and impact 
on tenure. In October, the 
Faculty Senate voted to delay the 
public access of the numerical 
evaluation data. 

In response to the concerns, 

CSG exceutives pointed to a 
report released by the University 
of Michigan Learning Analytics 
Task Force, created in 2013 by 
former Provost Phil Hanlon at 
request of the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs. According to the report, 
there is virtually no correlation 
between 
student 
grades 
and 

perceived workload and biases 
based on gender, race, ethnicity 

or citizenship status in regard to 
course evaluations. Chaired by 
Physics Prof. Tim McKay, director 
of the LSA Honors Program, the 
task force was operated for three 
years and consisted of faculty 
members from several schools 
and colleges.

Certain other parameters have 

also been put in place regarding 
the effects of the data release for 
the instructors. Pitt said first-
year instructors will not have 
their evaluation data released 
publically.

Sarkar and Pitt said their 

committees are the result of a 
three-way partnership between 
the CSG Executive Committee, 
University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollock and the Faculty Senate.

“As Cooper and the rest of 

the Executive Committee have 
promised, students will now have 
access to previously unavailable 
information to improve their 
course 
selection 
process, 

including evaluation data, by 
backpacking for the fall of 2016,” 
Sarkar and Pitt wrote in a joint 

e-mail.

Pitt also noted that along with 

the course evaluation data, the 
University is working on another 
tool to aid in course selection. The 
Academic Reporting Toolkit 2.0 
is a website that aims to be a one-
stop shop for the course selection 
process. Pitt said the tool will 
contain information about not 
only the professors who taught 
the course and when, but also 
the students who had previously 
taken it — including their majors 
and grades of an average student.

Pitt 
said 
CSG 
executive 

committee’s push for the release 
of course evaluations stems from 
recognizing the high cost of 
University courses and wanting 
students to be supplied with as 
much information as possible 
when selecting their courses.

“Students 
are 
paying 

thousands of dollars for each and 
every course that they take here,” 
Pitt wrote. “Most are taking out 
major student loans and many 
are working between classes just 
to be here. When we recognized 

how little reliable information 
there was to help students select 
the courses that they spend so 
much time and so many resources 
on, we knew we had to make a 
change.”

Pitt said during a CSG meeting 

last 
semester 
that 
releasing 

course evaluation data will allow 
students to form expectations 
of courses without resorting 
to third-party sources like the 
website 
RateMyProfessors.com. 

In a later interview, he noted 
that as an out-of-state student, he 
and many others have particular 
interest 
in 
accurate 
course 

information.

“Each course I take here costs 

thousands of dollars and I’m 
spending so much time and energy 
to be able to be a student here 
and it’s important that I can take 
courses that actually contribute 
to my growth and education,” Pitt 
said. “I only have two sentences 
to look at on the course selection 
website, that doesn’t really give 
me a basis from which to make a 
decision.”

Group hopes to 
provide better 

services for traveling 

students

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporter

On Sunday night, the Central 

Student 
Government 
Detroit 

Congress held a sparsely attended 
monthly meeting in the Michigan 
Union.

The 
Detroit 
Congress, 

sponsored by the Commission 
on Detroit Engagement, aims to 
bring together various student 
organizations and initiatives that 
work in and with the city of Detroit 
to collaborate and discuss Ann 
Arbor’s connection to the Motor 
City.

CSG 
members 
noted 
that 

attendance was down due to 
sickness, as noroviruscontinues 
to be present on campus. Three 
student 
organizations 
were 

represented at Sunday’s meeting: 
Detroit 
Revitalization 
and 

Business Initiative, Detroit Urban 

Debate Education and Trotter 
Multicultural Center organizers.

The 
meeting 
was 
chaired 

jointly by LSA sophomore Dylan 
Bennett and LSA junior Rohin 
Patel, co-chairs of the Detroit 
Congress. Despite the low turnout, 
Bennett said there are several 
other student organizations who 
have attended previous Detroit 
Congress 
meetings, 
including 

Detroit Partnership, JDs in the D 
and Seven Mile Music.

Two of the three organizations 

were new to the Detroit Congress, 
according to Patel who said he 
believes the lack of attendance 
overall did not keep them from 
having a productive conversation.

Sunday’s 
meeting 
focused 

primarily 
on 
the 
issue 
of 

transportation 
difficulties 
for 

students traveling between Ann 
Arbor and Detroit.

Several representatives voiced 

concern that their organizations do 
not have the resources to transport 
people to and from Detroit.

Students who want to get 

involved in Detroit are often 
asked to drive their own cars to 
downtown 
Detroit, 
attendees 

said. They may also be asked 
to pay for taxi cabs or Zipcars. 
The organizations often have 
the funding to reimburse their 
members for their travel expenses, 
but this places a financial burden on 
those members to pay money out of 
pocket before being reimbursed.

Currently, 
the 
University 

runs the Detroit Connector, a 
bus system that takes students 
from the Central Campus Transit 
Center to three different locations 
in downtown Detroit which runs 
four days a week.

However, LSA junior Alexis 

Lowe, the representative from 
Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center, 

pointed out that because the 
Connector requires an Mcard, 

Detroit residents cannot utilize the 
transit system to get to Ann Arbor.

“Because we hold cultural 

events at Trotter, I think it’d be 
really beneficial for Detroiters to 
come up here for that,” Lowe said.

Lowe added that this would fill 

the Connector during hours when 
it is less-used by University of 
Michigan students. She suggested 
implementing a small fee for use by

ON THE DAILY

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Toledo resident Liu Hua leads protests on the Diag on Saturday 
to protest the manslaughter conviction of Peter Liang, a former 
NYPD officer who fatally shot Akai Gurley, a Black man, in 
Brooklyn in 2014. Rallies in support of Liang occurred across the 
country on Saturday. His supporters say that he has been made 
a scapegoat for police brutality while other, often white, police 
officers with similar cases have not been convicted.

Swiping right on 

that potential suitor is 
becoming more common 
among American adults, 
according to a new Pew 
Research Center survey.

The national survey 

of over two thousand 
adults found about 15% of 
American adults report 
using online and/or mobile 
dating sites, compared to 
11% in early 2013.

A large part of this 

spike in online dating is 
connected to the increase 
in dating apps like Tinder, 
Bumble, Grindr and 
Zoosk, especially with 
high smartphone use 
among young people.

This overall 

increase is particularly 
distinguishable in two 
age groups: 18- to 24- year 
olds and 55- to 64- year 
olds.

In early 2013, only 

about 10% of the first age 
group reported having 
used online dating; today, 
the number has nearly 
tripled to 27%.

The number of users is 

growing across the range 
of American adults. The 
proportion of 55- to 64 
year olds who use online 
dating has doubled from 
6% in 2013 to 12% in 2015.

The study also looked 

into whether the outcome 
of online dating sites is 
the stereotypical one-
night-stand or if they truly 
create relationships. 29% 
of respondents reported 
they know someone 
who has married or 
entered into a long-term 
partnership with someone 
they met via online dating.

The survey also said 

college graduates and 
users from middle-to-
high-income populations 

are more likely to 
know people who have 
entered into a long-term 
relationship that began 
online. Nearly half of 
the college graduates 
know someone who has 
entered into a long-term 
partnership or marriage 
with someone they met via 
online dating.

Data also showed 

digital dating has received 
mostly positive reviews; 
a majority of users agree 
that it is advantageous 
over other ways of meeting 
potential partners. 

80% said that online 

dating is a good way to 
meet people; more than 
60% say that it allows 
people to find a better 
match and is much more 
efficient and easier than 
other means.

freshman physics and math 
major, is shoveling snow off a 
bench on campus. He works for 
UM-Flint part time.

Miller 
is 
one 
of 
three 

people on his street who have 
well water — but many of his 
family and friends are not as 
fortunate, he said. His friends 
come to his house regularly to 
take showers.

Miller said the unfolding 

magnitude of the water crisis is 
still unimaginable. 

“It was just sort of surreal 

for a while just because they 
had been talking about it for 
a long time — how there was 
something in their water — and 
it just wasn’t right,” he said. 

“My sister is dealing with it, 
and she was just starting to 
notice hair falling off — her 
skin would be really red when 
she got out of the shower for 
whatever reason and she didn’t 
know (why),” Miller said.

He added that any trust 

between 
Flint 
residents 

and 
their 
local 
and 
state 

governments that once existed 
has disappeared.

“At first it was like, ‘There’s 

no way the city of Flint is just 
going to allow the poisoning 
of 90,000 residents — no, they 
totally did,” Miller said. “It just 
helps to further cement the 
dichotomy — the line of trust 
that is just never gonna come 
back in terms of citizens and 
their government. It’s never 
gonna come back.”

Miller said he is further 

angered by the fact that national 
media, not the months of Flint 
residents’ complains, sparked 
governmental attention to the 
water crisis. 

“It was going on for a solid 

year and a half before the 
rest of the world picked up,” 
Miller said. “There’s a city of 
100,000 people being poisoned 
and no one seems to care just 
because 
they 
have 
shoddy 

infrastructure.”

Larry 
Tucker, 
a 
Flint 

resident who regularly uses 
UM-Flint campus recreational 
facilities, on Friday said he 
believes the government must 

take immediate action. He’s not 
alone in these sentiments by 
far — some state residents have 
called for moretransparency 
from Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 
while others call for his arrest.

Tucker added that the crisis 

has deeply impacted his level 
of trust in the government.

“I don’t trust whoever I’m 

drinking water from — no way,” 
he said. “Just because they 
put up a sign there that says 
‘filtered’ doesn’t necessarily 
mean it’s filtered because the 
government is always going to 
cover themselves.”

Caniejrah Marshall, a junior 

communications major at Mott 
Community College in Flint, 
works in a student convenience 
store in the Harding Mott 
University 
Center 
on 
the 

University’s Flint campus. Soft-
spoken, she answers questions 
as she checks out customers.

She said the water crisis 

has been particularly difficult 
for her to deal with due to her 
severe eczema, a condition that 
inflames the skin.

She noticed her skin turning 

extremely dry after showers 
directly after the city switched 
from using Lake Huron’s water 
to the Flint water supply. She 
suffers from regular itching 
spells and takes Benadryl on 
a nightly basis to alleviate the 
irritation.

Before government agencies 

and 
local 
charities 
began 

providing free bottled water to 
Flint residents, Marshall said 
she paid seven or eight dollars 
for cases of water, a costly 
expense. And though she has 
been buying bottled water, she 
continues to bathe in the tap 
water.

“I have no choice but to take 

a shower. It kind of makes you 
feel helpless because I can’t 
help but to take a shower — I 
can’t help but to cook in the 
water and I heard somewhere 
that they could’ve fixed it a 
long time ago so it would’ve 
been better if they just fixed 
it and treated it right in the 
beginning so people wouldn’t 
have to go through this,” 
Marshall said.

She said she is additionally 

troubled with the fact that 
government officials now face 
million-dollar projects to fix 
and replace the pipe system, 
whereas it would have initially 
cost $35,000.

Though she said she is 

appreciative of national and 
local efforts to provide water 
and filters, she worries about 
those who don’t have cars and 
therefore access to pick up 
bottled water.

Damario Mason works with 

Sodexo catering on UM-Flint’s 
campus. He said his aunts 
and cousins have experienced 
symptoms of lead poisoning, 
and his family recently decided 
to leave Flint.

“They’re losing hair. They’re 

getting rashes and it’s just not 
livable anymore so they just 
decided to leave,” Mason said. 
“I saw my little cousin the 
other day and she had a huge 
rash on her arm, and I knew 
she wouldn’t normally get that 
just from regular water.”

Denazia 
Pettway, 
a 

freshman public health and 
sciences major from Detroit, 
lives on UM-Flint’s campus.

Pettway 
said 
she 
only 

drinks tap water on UM-Flint’s 
campus thanks to a notification 
from University officials that 
it’s safe, and accompaying 
water filters. 

She added that she was 

disturbed 
by 
a 
lack 
of 

governmental 
accountability 

surrounding the water crisis.

“They just wanted to live 

their lives, but people are 
getting sick and people are 
dying and people are sad and 
they don’t know what to do 
because this is Flint,” she said. 
“Flint is not the richest city. 
Flint is very poor, and so they 
don’t have the money to go out 
and move — they don’t have 
that money. They don’t have 
those resources, so they have 
no choice but to sit in Flint and 
use water bottled water for 
everything.”

solutions.

Panelist Dr. Terry Thompson, 

assistant 
professor 
of 
the 

Department of Public Health 
and Health Sciences at the 
University of Michigan-Flint, 
has been working with a team 
of researchers on community-
based participatory research for 
what he calls the ‘91st day.’ He 
said the 91st day occurs after 
media coverage slows down and 
emergency funds stop coming.

“As you know, emergency 

funds, water and all this usually 
happens for 90 days. But what 
we’re interested in is what 
happens on the 91st day after 
CNN has gone,” he said. “So 
that’s what we’re interested in. 
We’ve got to find explicitly what 
is it that is needed, what is that 
gap.”

The event featured videos 

including from the local Fox 
News channel, “Let it Rip: Flint 
water crisis special” and “When 
the Water Runs Dry: Voices from 
the Detroit Water Crisis.”

Panelist Dr. Jerome Nriagu, 

a recently retired professor 
of 
Environmental 
Health 

Sciences at the School of Public 
Health, said he has done work 
on childhood lead poisoning 
in Flint and Detroit with a 
focus on the future of the water 
source. Nriagu said many of the 
solutions to decontaminate the 
water that were discussed in the 
Fox News video such as treating 
river water will not work even in 
the short term.

“First of all, somebody says 

you can treat Flint River water, 
the answer is no,” he said. 
“Because it’s contaminated with 
organic compounds and we still 
don’t know how to remove some 
of these organic compounds 
from any river water. So the 
idea that you can treat river 
water, from my own research 
experience, is false.”

Both Thompson and Nriagu 

discussed the possibility of 
removing and replacing the pipes 
of contaminated communities 
as a long-term solution to the 
water crises. Thompson said 

the procedure for removing 
pipes is not too complicated and 
takes a few hours, adding that 
community members should be 
trained to replace the pipes so 
they can feel involved.

“The people would feel that 

they are part of the solution 
and that confidence in itself will 
do so much for a community,” 
Thompson said.

All panelists said they agreed 

that that it is important for 
communities to feel empowered 
and to use their voices to show 
what the media will not show.

While 
much 
of 
the 

conversation in the media about 
water has been centered on 
Flint, panelist Alexis Ramsey, 
a charter commissioner for the 
city of Highland Park, said in 
2014 it was reported that over 
1,000 children in Highland Park 
had higher lead levels than the 
children of Flint and that there 
had been a 35 percent increase in 
water bills for bad water.

“We just want people to 

understand that we are fighting 
the same fight, no different 
than Flint, and our citizens and 
residents are facing the same 
thing,” said Ramsey.

Panelist Kim Sims, mayor of 

Muskegon Heights, noted that 
her city was one of several that 
avoided hiring an emergency 
manager, which Flint had while 
the crisis was unfolding. She 
added that her city has its own 
water filtration plant, saying 
she hoped to learn from the 
other panelists about water 
management.

“We do have our own water 

filtration plant that we own and 
operate completely,” she said. 
“At this point we are our own 
customers because we had two 
customers who decided to leave 
us for another municipality. I’m 
hoping to gain some knowledge 
actually while I’m here and 
assist the conversation however 
I can.”

Panelists also discussed the 

evident health issues facing the 
children of Flint.

Panelist and activist Monica 

Lewis-Patrick, co-founder of We 
the People of Detroit which aims 
to provide resources for Detroit 
citizens to better their quality of 

life, said children have already 
started showing health problems 
from the contamination.

“One of the things we know 

from working on the ground in 
Flint for almost two years is that 
teachers are already reporting 
that they are seeing behavioral 
issues and acting out increased 
in the classrooms,” said Lewis-
Patrick. “We also know that 
with these children, especially 
poor white, Black or brown 
children will be more likely to be 
incarcerated as opposed to being 
treated.”

Charles 
Ransom, 

Multicultural Studies librarian 
at the University Library, served 
on the committee that organized 
events for Black History Month. 
He said this event related to 
Black History Month because 
water 
crises 
are 
primarily 

happening in communities with 
a large population of African 
Americans.

“Just like what the speakers 

were saying, most of the cities 
that have been affected by the 
water issues are chocolate cities, 
they are Black cities,” he said. “It 
seems to follow the same script 
— the city loses money, the city 
has an asset, it’s water or it’s the 
water treatment plant and they 
lose it or something goes wrong.”

LSA junior Lauren Miles said 

she came to event because she 
was curious and had not gone 
to an event for Black Heritage 
Month yet. She said she wanted 
to know more about the water 
crisis in Flint.

“I knew of Flint, I didn’t really 

know the details of it and I really 
wanted to know the details 
because I keep on hearing things 
about water,” Miles said. “I took 
a one-credit class last year about 
water, it was more of a global 
view on water. This is another 
side of that conversation that is 
important; I think it’s everyone’s 
main concern.”

She added that though the 

event focused on Michigan, she 
thought anyone can learn from 
the issues discussed.

“I think we can take things 

from here and apply it to 
things that are happening 
all around the world,” she 
said.

taking place at the University. Prof. 
Gallimore said the University is a 
partner and subcontractor for the 
firm.

The X3, which is based on a 

series of thrusters developed at 
NASA, works by ejecting plasma at 
extremely high speeds out of the rear 
of a device, providing forward thrust. 
Plasma is ejected at speeds of up to 
30,000 meters per second, which is 
equal to about 65,000 miles per hour.

Scott Hall, a Ph.D. candidate 

in the Department of Aerospace 
Engineering, is the lead graduate 
student on the project. He said 
while the NextSTEP funding has 
only occurred in the past week, 
development of the design has been 
underway for some time.

“The funding through NextSTEP 

has been active for about a week, and 
the proposal for that was originally 
made about a year ago,” he said. 
“However, the X3’s development 
started somewhere around 2010 and 
the thruster has been assembled and 
operational since September 2013.”

The X3 is competing against two 

other designs for use in the XR-100 
system. According to Hall, this 
design is the only one of the three 
that has been created by members of 
a university.

The X3 design is also further 

ahead of competing designs in terms 
of development, Gallimore wrote in 
an email.

“It is more mature than any of 

the others, which means the risk 
of developing it is lower,” he wrote. 
“Also, it appears to be lighter and 
more efficient (in terms of converting 
spacecraft power to thrust) than the 
other systems.”

Hall also noted that the X3 design 

has a proven track record.

“The three different concepts are 

all electric propulsion, but they are 
all very different types,” he said. “The 
thruster we have developed here has 
a very proven track record: It is based 
on a series of thrusters developed at 
NASA.”

According to Gallimore, the short-

term goal is to bring the design to a 
level of readiness within three years.

“The goal is to bring the technology 

up to a readiness level in three years, 
that a follow-on contract could get 
the system ready for use in space a 
few years after NextSTEP is done,” 
he wrote.

Even if the design is ready in three 

years’ however, it will be longer until 
the X3 design can be tested or put 
to use in space. Gallimore said he 
believes one of the limitations will 
not be the U-M thruster, but rather 
the spacecrafts that would use it.

“The power system needed to 

drive this thruster is years away from 
development, so while the XR100 
system could be ready by 2020, I 
doubt we will have a spacecraft large 
enough or powerful enough by then 
to use it,” he said.

Hall agreed and said it will take 

some time for the design to be put to 
use.

“Realistically, it would probably be 

10 years or so until something based 
on this work was operated in space,” 
he said. “But our project is ambitious 
and if successful will get us much 
closer than we are right now to being 
ready to fly for the first time.”

Hall 
added 
that 
there 
are 

several other potential uses of this 
technology beyond just propelling 
humans to Mars.

“The X3 was developed not only 

with Mars missions in mind, but also 
a range of other applications,” he said. 
“The thruster was designed to be run 
down to as low as 1 kW and up to 200 
kW, so it has a huge range of ‘throttle 
ability,’ as we say. Something like it 
could be used to maneuver heavy 
satellites in orbit around Earth, for 
cargo tugs to places like Mars, to 
crewed mission to places like Mars, 
and as a way to get a very large probe 
to deep space much quicker than by 
traditional means.”

non-students.

Several of the representatives 

voiced concerns that the Connector 
often runs regardless of whether 
people are riding it, meaning it 
often runs empty.

CSG representatives added that 

the Connector also has a marketing 
issue — few people know of its 
existence. Business junior Danny 
Kaprielian, the representative from 
Detroit Urban Debate Education, 
remarked that he had not heard of 
the Connector until this meeting. 
His organization sends students to 
Detroit regularly.

The 
Connector 
is 
funded 

through the Office of the Provost 
and will expire June of this year. 
The funding will then need to be 
renewed.

The 
transportation 
issue 
is 

one that underscores the lack of 
communication and coordination 
across 
student 
organizations 

working in Detroit organizers said, 
which is what the Detroit Congress 
is working to combat.

Bennett said some of these issues 

with the Detroit Connector are to 
be expected, such as a disconnect 
between those who are running the 
transportation and those who need 
to use it.

“So I guess it’s just a lack of 

communication in different aspects, 
as one might expect,” Bennett said.

The meeting ended with a 

broader discussion on what the 
organizations can do to strengthen 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 

University and the city of Detroit.

Patel said he finds it helpful to 

structure the Detroit Congress’ 
meetings around common problems 
that all the student organizations 
can relate to.

“It’s very beneficial to talk about 

broad issues surrounding Detroit 
engagement like social justice, 
community service, business and 
transportation, like we discussed 
today,” Patel said.

The next meeting will be in 

March. Bennett and Patel said 
they’re 
attempting 
to 
bring 

University 
administrators 
to 

upcoming meetings.

is not a Christian. This is not the gospel.

FROM THE DAILY

Democracy for Detroit schools

In response to mass protests by DPS teachers 

and the Detroit Federation of Teachers lawsuit 
against DPS, Darnell Earley, the city’s state-
appointed emergency manager, announced this 
February he’ll leave the position Feb. 29. Earley 
was also the emergency manager for the city 
of Flint, a position from which he also resigned 
without issuing any sort of public apology. 
Furthermore, during his time in Detroit, Earley 
has consistently not listened to residents. Earley 
has criticized teachers who participated in sick-
outs. After pursuing the lawsuit, DFT has also 
attempted to bring in its own health inspectors. 
However, DPS officials stopped these inspectors 
from entering all but one school building, 
saying DFT’s inspectors would “complicate the 
district’s efforts to fully comply with state and 
local regulations.” Now state lawmakers are 
considering legislation to provide funding and 
revitalize the school district.

The trend of Snyder concentrating control 

of the city’s poorest areas in the hands of the 
unelected is unacceptable. Most alarming is 
that in recent months, Snyder’s emergency 
managers have essentially acted with impunity 
while the populations they governed suffered.

That’s not to say that serious financial 

reform like that which Detroit, Flint and others 
are undergoing won’t come with sacrifices. 
However, on the exterior, Detroit seems 
like a city on the rise. New restaurants and 
young residents have moved downtown. The 
riverfront has been revitalized, a new hockey 
stadium is in the works and the Detroit auto 
show hit record-high attendance this past 
January with more than 800,000 visitors, the 
most it has seen in 12 years.

But an apparent contradiction lies in 

investing whatever it takes to revive Detroit’s 
urban core while ignoring the buildings 
crumbling around its most vulnerable residents. 
DPS teachers are the only ones doing anything 
constructive to raise awareness, but are being 
met with serious resistance. It’s easy to see why 
teachers are frustrated with administrators, 
especially because administrators are also 
using funds that could be used to fix schools to 
sue many of the teachers who have participated 
in 
sick-outs. 
Their 
reasoning: 
Sick-out 

protesters are depriving students of their right 
to attend school, adversely impacting students’ 

academic progress, depriving students of their 
breakfast and lunches, forcing parents and 
non-striking DPS employees to miss work and 
wasting taxpayer money.

Looking at photographs of the conditions 

of Detroit schools’ buildings, it is obvious 
that these conditions existed before the sick-
outs, and are only going to get worse unless 
someone calls attention to them — which is 
exactly what teachers accomplished in holding 
sick-outs. Lack of administration funding for 
instructional 
materials 
adversely 
impacts 

each student’s right to an education, and it’s 
not a stretch of reason to conclude that a leaky 
cafeteria roof might deprive students of safe, 
healthy breakfasts and lunches.

The teachers participating in sick-outs 

should be applauded for their dedication. 
Earley and DPS officials should not be acting 
against the teachers, but instead in conjunction 
with them and DFT.

The 
demographics 
of 
districts 
with 

appointed emergency managers must also 
be called into question. Grosse Pointe, a 
93.2-percent white town, is just 10 miles away 
from the 82.7-percent African-American 
Detroit, but its schools aren’t crumbling. 
DPS has failed administratively to provide 
adequate education for its students, but the 
implications of socioeconomic status and race 
cannot be ignored. The inequality between 
public school systems — not just in Grosse 
Pointe, but throughout the state — begs the 
question: Why are some students afforded 
top-notch instruction while others have to 
settle for substandard education?

Emergency managers in both Flint and 

Detroit were only accountable to numbers on 
a spreadsheet, and never to the actual human 
beings they governed. In the cases of Flint and 
DPS, it seems Earley is failing to recognize 
the tangible impacts his decisions are 
having on human lives. Snyder and the DPS 
administration need to realize that behind all 
the debt, behind all the money and behind all 
the problems are real students who deserve an 
education. It is possible to make a difference 
through kindness, empathy and compassion. 
If the people in power can remember that 
when they are making decisions, then Detroit 
will be one step closer to revitalization.

Why I stopped listening to Kanye

M

y 
hands 
were 
raised 

toward the air, a sign of 
praise to God. My head 

was 
lowered, 

eyes closed, as 
I 
just 
wanted 

to soak in the 
moment. I was 
not at church, 
but I felt like I 
was taken there. 
I was listening 
to 
“Ultralight 

Beam,” the first 
track of Kanye 
West’s 
new 

album, The Life 
of Pablo. West 
described this new work as a gospel 
album before its release, and while 
listening to the first song, I believed 
him. The choir roared through my 
speakers and Chance The Rapper’s 
verse gave me goose bumps. But as I 
went through the songs in the rest of 
the album, I found myself thinking, 
Did Kanye really just say that? Kanye 
West has always been known for 
his over-the-top ego and critically 
acclaimed music style. I am a fan of 
his and honestly enjoy every song 
on The Life of Pablo. But some of the 
lyrics and his recent tweets have 
been questionable, to say the least.

The nature of his words can’t just 

be swept under the rug saying, “Oh, 
that’s just Kanye.” We still listen to 
the music, but we should no longer 
view West as a role model or idol.

Fans can be caught in an awkward 

middle ground when a celebrity or 
anyone they admire messes up or 
says something they don’t agree with. 
I grew up a huge fan of Tiger Woods. 
I wrote a report on him in fifth grade 
because he paved the way for Black 
and mixed people in golf and kicked 
ass while doing it. He runs founda-
tions to promote golf with children 
who live in the inner cities and his 
Tiger Woods Learning Center has 
five campuses across the United 
States that teach college-access class-
es to underprivileged kids.

But when he announced on Feb. 

19, 2010 that he cheated on his wife 
with multiple women, I was 14. I was 
upset, but quickly forgave him, prob-
ably because I had been a fan since I 
could remember. I was just 14, and I 
thought the good he did trumped his 
mistake that he took ownership for.

There obviously is a difference 

between cheating on your wife and 
using controversial lyrics, but Woods 
apologized and some have forgiven 
him. West, on the other hand, has 
continued using controversial lyrics 

time and time again without remorse. 
In his song “On Sight” from Yeezus, 
he raps, “Soon as I pull up and park 
the Benz / We get this bitch shaking 
like Parkinson’s.” In the song “Blood 
on the Leaves,” (also from Yeezus) he 
compares sitting courtside across the 
court from your wife at a basketball 
game to apartheid.

West hasn’t apologized or owned 

up to the controversy. He isn’t obli-
gated to, but he should. Because he 
doesn’t take responsibility for what 
he puts out there, we cannot respect 
him for anything else but possibly his 
musical talent. As listeners, we must 
deliberate whether we want to sup-
port an artist who makes outrageous 
claims or hurtful statements.

Much of the uproar about lyrics 

on The Life of Pablo comes from two 
separate bars, “I feel like me and Tay-
lor might still have sex / Why, I made 
that bitch famous,” and “Do anybody 
feel bad for Bill Cosby? Did he forget 
the names like Steve Harvey?”

West defends the first lyric by say-

ing in a series of tweets, “First thing 
is I’m an artist and as an artist I will 
express how I feel with no censor-
ship. 2nd thing I asked my wife for 
her blessings and she was cool with 
it. 3rd thing I called Taylor and had 
an hour long convo with her about 
the line and she thought it was funny 
and gave her blessings. 4th bitch is 
an endearing term in hip hop like the 
word n****.”

But Swift and her representatives 

deny the claim wholeheartedly say-
ing, “She declined and cautioned him 
about releasing a song with such a 
strong misogynistic message. Taylor 
was never made aware of the actual 
lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.’ ”

Because of West’s past use of lyr-

ics and the fact that he called Swift 
“fake ass” backstage on SNL last 
week, we cannot take his word. 
And isn’t it weird, though he had 
his wife’s blessing, that West talks 
about having sex with another 
woman while he is married?

And no, Kanye, I certainly don’t 

feel bad for Bill Cosby. Dude, the song 
was great until you said that. “Facts 
(Charlie Heat Version)” is such a 
great song to fire you up before an 
exam or even to aggressively eat your 
cereal, but when I heard that line, 
my face shriveled up and I took out 
my headphones. West has tweeted, 
“BILL COSBY INNOCENT !!!!!!!!!!” 
and Cosby is not. Too many women 
have bravely stepped forward to say 
that Cosby had assaulted or raped 
them for anyone to think Cosby is 
anything but guilty.

We can idolize characters or celeb-

rities, like Cosby was adored for his 
television show and stand-up sets, 
and when they make a mistake, we 
may deny it or shrug it off. Of course, 
depending on the severity of the 
offense, we can accept apologies, 
like in the case of Woods, or have our 
opinions change permanently, like 
with Cosby.

Kanye does not apologize for his 

antics, but he does remain one step 
ahead of those who criticize him. 
In “Feedback,” he raps, “I can’t let 
these people play me / Name one 
genius that ain’t crazy.” Even the 
apostle Paul, a writer of the Bible’s 
New Testament — who the album 
is named after according to West 
— was perceived as more than out 
there during his time. Kanye West 
is crazy, but has reached new levels 
of self-absorption and being com-
pletely unapologetic.

Paul wrote in Romans 12:2, “Do 

not be conformed to this world, but 
be transformed by the renewal of 
your mind, that by testing you may 
discern what is good and acceptable 
and perfect.” This verse is difficult 
to follow for any Christian. But it 
put me in the mindset that some of 
the things that West says are unac-
ceptable, and should not be taken 
lightly because he hasn’t publicly 
apologized for any of them, even if 
he does internally regret some of 
the things he has said.

Even West’s former songwriting 

partner, Rhymefest, said that West 
needs spiritual and mental help. 
West’s narcissism has reached 
a boiling point and it can put his 
fans in a middle ground — at least 
it has for me. In my opinion, his 
music is excellent. But I’ve been 
disappointed with his words. Even 
if he may be joking, thus far, he 
hasn’t indicated so.

Part of me wants to keep listen-

ing to The Life of Pablo, but at the 
same time, I don’t think I can sup-
port West because of his words. 
The album is great, filled with great 
production, beats and also lyrics 
that I enjoy.

But the bad has outweighed the 

good for me, so I ripped off the Band-
Aid and I deleted it off my phone.

West and I agree on this: Only God 

can judge him. I just choose not to 
support his music anymore.

Kanye West can take us to church. 

But his words can’t be taken as triv-
ial.

oilet water falling from the ceiling, mushrooms sprouting 
from the walls and black mold infestation are just some of the 
conditions that students and teachers have had to face on a daily 

basis in Detroit Public Schools. It is difficult to imagine that any city’s 
residents would allow their elected officials to treat their children with 
such indignity. But Detroit residents don’t even have the opportunity to 
make that choice, because Gov. Rick Snyder (R) has utilized the state’s 
financial emergency law to give a non-elected, state-appointed emergency 
manager practically complete control over DPS affairs. The events that 
have unfolded in recent weeks surrounding DPS are a reflection of a 
larger trend within the state government: Too much power is being 
concentrated in the hands of non-elected, state-appointed officials to the 
detriment of Michigan citizens.

Lackadaisical language and “progressive” politics
T

hey might seem like empty 
political talking points, but 
the recent skirmishes over 

who 
or 
what 

is 
a 
Democrat 

or 
progressive 

actually offer us 
the opportunity 
to 
expand 

our 
political 

discourse 
and 

redefine 
the 

spectrum 
of 

acceptable 
political opinion.

In a town hall 

last week, Hill-
ary Clinton once 
again grossly paraphrased Bernie 
Sanders’ criticisms of President 
Barack Obama, alleging that Sanders 
called the president “weak,” “flawed” 
and so on. (Apparently, criticizing 
the current president is unbecoming 
of presidential candidates.) Clinton 
ultimately suggested that “Senator 
Sanders wasn’t really a Democrat 
until he decided to run for president.” 
The crowd responded with a mix of 
boos and applause.

Though he caucuses with the 

Democrats and supports many of 
their legislative initiatives, as a mat-
ter of fact, Sanders was not a mem-
ber of the Democratic Party until he 
decided to run for president. I don’t 
see why Sanders’ status as an inde-
pendent or his willingness to criti-
cize President Obama should worry 
us. In fact, it’s the reason many of us 
support him. If Clinton’s criticism 
here amounts to saying that Sanders 
rejects establishment politics, she is 
just knocking on the open door.

But let’s allow ourselves to briefly 

play this language game of putting 
names to politicians and policies 
and see who falls in the categories 
of Democrat or progressive. In 1963, 
Sanders was being arrested at civil 
rights rallies in Chicago. He also 
participated in marches with Martin 
Luther King Jr. In 1964, Clinton was 
supporting Republican presidential 
candidate Barry Goldwater, avowed 
opponent to the civil rights move-
ment. Clinton would go on to work 
for other Republicans, such as Ger-
ald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller. In 

terms of partisanship, Clinton plain-
ly appears to be the least Democratic 
(i.e. most Republican) of the two.

Though her husband was offi-

cially a Democrat, his critics have 
often pointed out how his presidency 
blurred the traditional lines between 
our country’s two dominant par-
ties by supporting policies that were 
highly conservative. For example, 
Michelle 
Alexander 
frequently 

talks about how the 1994 crime bill 
extended and intensified Reagan’s 
war on drugs, by pouring billions of 
dollars into the destruction of Black 
communities across the country.

These labels (Democrat, Republi-

can, progressive, conservative, etc.) 
don’t literally mean what they used 
to, as with most other labels in our 
political discourse. Last I checked, 
U.S. Republicans don’t believe in the 
idea of the republic any more than 
U.S. Democrats do. Liberals don’t 
believe in open-handedness any 
more than conservatives believe in 
conserving anything. Libertarian-
ism in this country usually means 
market fundamentalism (i.e. let-
ting a few people who control a vast 
majority of the nation’s capital deter-
mine the lives of the less privileged) 
instead of what it maybe once meant 
(i.e. something closer to the Thore-
auvian notion that people ought to 
determine their own destinies free 
from the constraints of big govern-
ment and big commerce). Point being, 
these terms either don’t denote much 
of anything substantive, or their cur-
rent common usage has perverted 
their old meaning into its opposite. 
So let’s not worry too much about 
how the mainstream media assigns 
politicians these titles.

If the Sanders campaign ultimate-

ly does nothing else, it has forced 
millions of people, who might not 
otherwise be inclined, to reckon with 
the true meaning of these terms. The 
disagreement between Sanders and 
Clinton over terms like “progres-
sive” represents a larger ideological 
disagreement between the two. It is 
a disagreement between liberals and 
the New Left (beautifully embodied 
in Ms. Nina Simone’s song, “Missis-
sippi Goddam”). It is a disagreement 
today over fundamental political and 

economic questions, like “Is corrup-
tion a symptom of Wall Street when 
it’s not properly regulated, or is cor-
ruption inherent to its very struc-
ture?” and “Are health care and 
college education luxuries, or are 
they economic rights?” and “Should 
the government serve the will of the 
citizens, or just (to borrow a phrase) a 
handful of billionaires?”

This contrast benefits people 

whom, by watching CNN, ABC 
nightly news, MSNBC, etc. before 
the Sanders campaign, might not 
otherwise have noticed that there 
are other — and, in my view, more 
compelling — visions of progress 
than the liberal, pessimistic Obama-
Clinton vision. While the president 
and Hillary Clinton say to go slow, 
Sanders and Ms. Simone say that’s 
what’s the trouble.

If we want to reinvest signifiers 

like “progressive” with meaning and 
efficacy, we should first avoid adopt-
ing their common usage. Instead, 
we should critique this perverse 
usage and appropriate these terms 
according to our own purposes. In 
other words, after overcoming our 
cultural speech impediment, we 
appropriate the term “progressive” 
according to what we ourselves 
declare progress to be.

In this postmodern era, when 

the signifier has apparently lost all 
connection with the signified, it’s 
tempting to conclude that we have 
no hope of using language effective-
ly (especially political language). 
But this conclusion overlooks the 
fact that words have the meaning 
that we invest in them in order to 
serve our individual and commu-
nal interests and concerns. Inves-
tigating the meaning of words not 
only improves our ability to com-
municate; it improves our ability to 
think, expanding our political hori-
zons beyond the binary of liberal 
and conservative and into a whole 
field of potential political opinion, 
which might include socialism, to 
anarcho-syndicalism, to #Black-
LivesMatter. That’d be what I’d call 
progress.

EVENT PREVIEW
CBCO rings in the 
new year in Detroit

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

The mental image that general-

ly accompanies the word “orches-
tra” is that of a large mass of 
European instruments gathered 
together 
in 
front 

of a wild-
haired 
conductor 
enthusi-
astically 
waving 
a 
baton 

— 
which 

is 
fair, 

consider-
ing 
that 

in 
almost 

any 
con-

text this image would be largely 
accurate. But on occasion the 
word is applied to an ensemble 
which defies expectations, shak-
ing off linguistic preconceptions 
to present the public with some-
thing unanticipated. This is the 
case with the China Broadcasting 
Chinese Orchestra, which will be 
performing in Detroit Monday 
evening under the direction of 
Pang Kapang.

“It’s a combination of all 

different types of Chinese tra-
ditional instruments — that’s 
including percussion, strings 
and wind instruments — but 
it’s set up very similar to a 
Western symphonic orchestra,” 
Wei Yu, principal cellist with 
the Detroit Symphony Orches-
tra, said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “It’s like 
a large orchestra version of 

… Chinese traditional instru-
ments.”

The CBCO was founded in 

1953, formed by the combination 
of two previous Chinese orches-
tras. Over the subsequent decades 
it has come to stand as a symbol 
of Chinese culture, led to promi-
nence by conductor and composer 
Peng Xiuwen.

“The piece I’m playing with the 

orchestra is … a modern adaption 
of a very traditional, old folk melo-
dy,” Yu said, who will be featured 
as a soloist on the CBCO concert 
for the piece Huaer Caprice said. 
“It’s based on a very well-known 
film back in the ’60s. The movie 
is called ‘The Visitors from the 
Icy Mountain’; the theme song … 
has become a popular song called 
‘Why are the Flowers So Red?’”

The melody, while a folk tune, 

is actually not Chinese in origin 
— rather, its roots are Tajik, a des-
ignation which refers to a wide 
range of Persian speaking peoples 
of Iranian origin. Since “Visitors 
from the Icy Mountain,” however, 
the melody has become widely 
known in China.

“I grew up in mainland China — 

I know that tune really well,” the 
cellist said. “(The piece) is such a 
showcase of the cello and another 

(Chinese) string instrument … it 
becomes a virtuoso piece for two 
solo instruments accompanied by 
this large orchestra.”

Many of the pieces the CBCO 

will be presenting are similar — 
modern arrangements of tradi-
tional Chinese folk music — but 
several are original compositions 
as well.

“A lot of folk melody is from 

the voice, or from one single 
instrument — right now they are 
adapting a lot of varieties into this 
kind-of Western kind-of orches-
tration, or symphonic, version of 
the tradition,” Yu said.

CBCO is visiting Detroit to cel-

ebrate the Chinese New Year. On 
February 8th the new Year of the 
Monkey was inaugurated, an event 
which occurs once every 12 years 
in the cyclical Chinese calendar .

“The Chinese New Year is cel-

ebrated worldwide these days,” 
Yu said. “Before I joined the DSO 
I was also a member of the New 
York Philharmonic. For a few 
years we started to have a Chinese 
New Year celebration in concerts.”

The concert, Yu said, touches 

universal themes of music and 
ideas of cultural dialogue.

“I’m just really happy to be 

a cultural ambassador between 
American and China, together 
celebrating the Chinese New 
Year … music is a bridge that 
links two cultures together,” Yu 
said. “I’m very proud to be part 
of the cultural ambassador (sic) 
using the common language 
of music … I hope that way to 
introduce Chinese culture and 
music to a wider audience, and 
vice versa.”

ALBUM REVIEW

Chicago Kid’s “In 
My Mind” is just 
original enough

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Make no mistake. As closely 

tied as BJ the Chicago Kid may be 
with hip hop today, he is through 
and through an 
R&B artist. His 
early mixtapes 
contained 
a 

plethora of overt 
references 
to 

traditional R&B 
gods 
— 
Sam 

Cooke, 
James 

Brown, 
Mar-

vin Gaye — and 
his sound has 
always reflected that reverence for 
classics.

At times this has worked to 

his detriment. His first mixtape, 
Taste of Chicago, while an enjoy-
able piece of soul showcasing his 
smooth, crooning voice, sounded 
ill-fatedly bound to be the back-
ground music for overzealous, vir-
ginal high school boys dropping 
$1.99 clearance rose flower ped-
als over their extra-long twin bed 
in an attempt to convince their 
apprehensive, younger, girlfriends 
that this is finally the “right time.” 
There’s even the obligatory “Sex-
ual Healing” cover. Those prede-
cessors so prevalent on his earlier 
works seemed to box him in as he 
held them so tightly.

Whether by personal growth 

or external pressure, BJ has 
branched out towards the con-
temporary. BJ’s feature on rapper 
Schoolboy Q’s track “Studio” was 
undoubtedly his major break into 

the public lexicon. Still, he was by 
no means unknown prior, lend-
ing his voice to standout releases 
like Kendrick Lamar’s Section.80, 
Chance the Rapper’s Acid Rap 
and Ab-Soul’s Control System. 
His most recent full release, The 
M.A.F.E. Project, offered samples 
from Kanye West’s futuristic 
album Yeezus and a rendition of 
Justin Timberlake’s “Strawberry 
Bubblegum.” It’s an acknowledge-
ment that, for better or worse, pop-
inspired bass and synths are the 
majority of R&B tracks in 2016, not 
jazz bands and orchestral sounds. 

In My Mind, BJ’s major-label 

debut, finds the artist merging 
his past and present, trying not 
to compromise either. He shows 
impressive growth both vocally 
and sonically, likely a result of the 
talented crowd he’s associated 
himself with, and there’s an obvi-
ous tinge of tradition here. But 
there’s an equally poignant mod-
ern element that helps keep this 
album from feeling like any other 
nostalgic work of soul.

Opening the album on “Intro,” 

BJ jokes “I love God, but I also 
love mob movies.” It’s a fitting 
introduction to In My Mind, which 
pulls influence from both. “Man 
Down,” which leans closer to 
mob movies, both on account of 
the berretta-like beat and lyrics 
like “you can’t fuck with me and 
my n****s,” is probably the clos-
est BJ will come to the radio. It’s a 
forward-moving track that brings 
an energy that was sometimes 
absent from his earlier releases. 
On the other hand, there’s no lack 
of slow piano-ballad sermons on 
this debut. “Shine,” Falling On 
My Face,” and “Jeremiah/World 
Needs More Love,” all lean on 
his love for God. On the latter, he 
makes this unquestionably clear: 

“Just in case you were wonder-
ing what Jeremiah I’m speaking 
of, not the singer but the prophet 
from the bible.”

The best moments of this 

album come when BJ can bring 
both of these elements together. 
“Church,” featuring Chance the 
Rapper and Buddy, sees him con-
templating that line between 
church and sin. “She say she 
wanna drink, do drugs and have 
sex tonight / But I got church in 
the morning,” he sings. He delivers 
the lines playfully, like he knows 
what he wants but also what he 
needs. Impressively, he holds his 
own with Chance, who has a habit 
of taking center stage on a number 
of his guest appearances.

The Kendrick collaboration, 

“The New Cupid,” is another high-
light that marries new and old, 
and again involves BJ looking at 
his moral compass — “Cupid’s too 
busy in the club” he notes. The 
interplay between Kendrick and 
BJ is powerful, with both seeming 
to guide each other, like friendly 
musicians in a jazz band.

BJ has been often compared 

to D’Angelo, on account of simi-
larities in his voice and tributes 
(both subtle references and entire 
album covers) that BJ has made 
to the artist. Indeed, BJ seems 
like the natural succession from 
D’Angelo’s ’90s neo-soul towards 
a more rap-heavy modern scene. 
BJ doesn’t have the power, though, 
that D’Angelo’s voice does, and the 
more old-fashioned, vocal second 
half of In My Mind could turn off 
listeners that were initially held by 
the tempo of the opening tracks.

Still, In My Mind is a solid 

attempt at bridging BJ’s different 
worlds. It neither succumbs total-
ly to pop-pressure, nor holds too 
completely to tradition.

‘Saul’ haunts

By DANIEL HENSEL

For the Daily

It has become nearly impossible 

to separate the Holocaust from 
its cinematic legacy. We’ve seen 
Oscar-winning 
feature 
films 

and 
documen-

taries 
of 
all 

tones, all sub-
ject matters and 
from numerous 
countries on the 
topic. And while 
this subject is 
far from a tired 
one, its sheer prevalence in a way 
calls for some new interpretation 
of the horrors of the early 1940s. 
“Son of Saul,” directed by Hungar-
ian first-timer László Nemes, is yet 
another film to add to the subject 
matter’s collection of works, but it 
satisfyingly goes beyond the con-
ventional messages and techniques 
of the works that came before.

The film follows the titular Saul 

Ausländer, 
played 
impeccably 

by first-time actor Géza Röhrig, 
through a day and a half at Aus-
chwitz. There, Saul is a prisoner and 
member of the Sonderkommando, 
a labor force comprised of Jewish 
prisoners who were coerced into 
assisting the Nazis in disposing 
the bodies of gas chamber victims 
at the threat of their own death. 
Saul comes across the body of a 
boy whom he claims as a son, and 
attempts to find a rabbi to give the 
boy a proper burial, while also join-
ing a cadre of fellow workers who 
are attempting to escape. These 
two stories interweave as Nazi offi-
cers decide to trim Ausländer’s spe-
cific group of workers. That last plot 
point, (like a boa constrictor tight-
ening on its prey,) turns the film 
into more of a taut thriller.

“Son 
of 
Saul” 
differs 
so 

strongly from other Holocaust 
movies because its subjects are 
not larger than life. Whereas 
“Schindler’s List” features a man 
who saved about 1,000 Jews, 
and “The Diary of Anne Frank” 
follows a girl whose story has 
become legend, “Son of Saul” is 
a fictitious story about a group 
of people who have been largely 
forgotten. When Saul enters the 
screen, we know nothing of him, 
his past and his fate. The story 
renders Saul as a stand-in for 
all the victims whose stories we 

have forgotten.

And yet, “Son of Saul” retains 

a narrow scope in its examina-
tion of the human experience in 
horrifying circumstances. Saul, 
who wears a deadened expres-
sion throughout much of the film, 
is seen at his most lucid when on 
the quest for the rabbi. Otherwise, 
Saul resembles little more than an 
abused worker who, because of the 
conditions, has been dehumanized 
beyond 
emotional 
recognition. 

Saul’s decisions in the company of 
fellow workers are peculiar, but 
they serve to emphasize that ratio-
nality is a luxury in such harrow-
ing experiences.

But while Saul is the most fea-

tured character, the true stars 
of the film are its below-the-line 
craftsmen. Mátyás Erdély’s shaky, 
kinetic cinematography instills a 
true sense of chaos, while the quick 
pace of the script itself underscores 
the quickly approaching doom of 
the characters. Matthieu Tapo-
nier’s editing features several 
long, uninterrupted takes, many 
of which depict relatively mun-
dane events, like Saul standing in 
a hallway as several new prisoners 
pass him on their way to the gas 
chamber. This deliberative pacing 
both adds to the mounting dread 
of knowing what awaits these pris-
oners, as well as the bit of relief of 
knowing Saul gets to live for a few 
seconds more than we would have 
seen if the clip had been edited. 
Further, the camera follows Saul 
around, like a third-person video 
game following its main charac-
ter, while the typical horrors of 
the Holocaust are confined to the 
corners or, more often, off-screen. 
The biggest accomplishment is the 
film’s superb soundscape, designed 
by Tamás Zányi, which trans-
forms off-camera conversations 
into menacing words looming over 
Saul’s, and our, head. The sounds 
of screaming, crying, burning and 
hard labor combine to create an 
opus of pure sonic horror.

“Son of Saul” was Nemes’s 

attempt to cure the ills of the Holo-
caust film. He avoids spectacle, 
heroes and happy endings, the typ-
ical fixtures that make the subject 
matter artificially digestible. And 
most of all, rather than attempting 
to be a sprawling epic, “Son of Saul” 
is impossibly small, opting to focus 
on its main character rather than 
the horrors that surround him.

I 

always thought it was weird 
how many people I talked 
to would name “Lost in the 

World” as their favorite Kanye 
song. Don’t get me wrong — it’s 
an amazing 
track that 
scales incred-
ibly huge 
heights— but 
all things con-
sidered, it’s 
just another 
major high-
light of an 
album with 
about a dozen 
of them. “Lost 
in the World” is a coda to one of 
the greatest records of all time, 
but as a non-single, the enthu-
siasm I’ve heard for it over the 
years was a little perplexing.

I have yet to form a solid opinion 

on Kanye’s latest: The Life of Pablo. 
I want to hail Rihanna singing Nina 
Simone over a sample of “Bam 
Bam” as some of the best music I’ve 
ever heard, but I need to forget about 
those opening Taylor-Swift-referenc-
ing lines to do so. I think “No More 
Parties in LA” is one of Kanye’s best 
songs ever, but it’s sandwiched in 
between two of his most mediocre. 
When I was walking to class this 
week I always thought about try-
ing to pick a song from the album 
to listen to, but I usually found that 
I’d rather listen to something like 
Acid Rap. When I can give it my full 
attention, though, and I’m not just 
looking for pleasant songs I love in 
between lectures, I’ve been pouring 
over Pablo, trying to make as much 
sense of it as I can. But I’m still 
completely overwhelmed by Kanye’s 
vision. The Life of Pablo is hip hop’s 
answer to James Joyce — genius-
level intellect and never-before-
thought creative ambitions fully 
realized to a hysterical extent that’s 
astounding yet impenetrable. This 
album is Kanye’s fickle impulsive 
genius brain made painfully public 
in the most tangible way possible, 
but to even call Pablo an album and 
put it in the same category as the 
millions of traditional collections of 
songs out there in the world doesn’t 
feel quite right.

But as I listened to TLOP, I found 

my mind going back to “Lost in 

the World.” Kanye’s verse on this 
song is one huge contradiction, as 
he speaks to this “you” who seems 
to represent every gigantic idea, 
good and bad, in the entire universe. 
And when I hear Pablo, I hear all 
of the ideas in Kanye’s head trying 
to become tangible and fit together, 
with no filter and nothing holding 
them back. The art Kanye creates is 
everything he is and all he wants to 
be, layered one on top of the other 
and relentlessly captured from every 
possible angle. Music is his devil, his 
angel, his heaven, his hell, his now 
and forever, his freedom and his jail, 
his lies and his truth.

Now listen to “Father Stretch My 

Hands” off Life of Pablo. Kanye’s 
two-part track incorporates soulful 
backing vocals like Marvin Gaye’s 
What’s Going On, features classical 
composer Caroline Shaw, a Future 
sound-alike, a Metro Boomin’ drop, 
his dumbest lyrics (the bit about the 
bleached-asshole model on part one) 
and some of his darkest (everything 
he says on part two.) Kanye throws 
all these pieces into a vortex and 
expects us to make sense of whatev-
er the final composition turns out to 
be. “Father Stretch My Hands” is a 
song that not that long ago wouldn’t 
have even registered as music. It’s an 
enourmous contradiction of sounds 
that tests your patience and pounds 
at you and purposely evades any-
thing comfortable or familiar, and 
it’s endlessly fascinating even if it’s 
not entirely satisfying.

I obviously have no idea what 

Kanye West’s actual mental state 
is now or has ever really been, but 
unlike some critics and fans, The 
Life of Pablo and the circus sur-
rounding it don’t make me person-
ally worried for his long-term sanity. 
In that SNL audio, I just heard a 
really stressed-out dude finally los-
ing it after days of non-stop work; in 
his tweets, I just see cries for atten-
tion and experimentation (“what 
happens if I say this?”) mixed with 
occasional smart lucidity; in the 
music itself, I just hear a mostly self-
aware Kanye trying to be as real as 
possible, not self-editing or holding 
back any of his ideas, stretching 
himself as far as he can go.

Kanye’s music has always strived 

for this childlike state — one where 
all dreams are possible and society’s 

norms are meaningless and the worst 
thing someone can do to you is lie—
and more than ever that young cre-
ative ideal is what I hear on Pablo. 
Being a kid, there’s always a conflict 
between maturity and immaturity 
— multiple interior parts of yourself 
duking it out as you try to figure 
out who you are and what kind of 
person you’re going to become, and 
in Kanye’s broken experiments and 
regrettable phrasings and glorious, 
inspired combinations of sounds, 
that’s exactly what I hear.

And so as I try to figure out what 

Life of Pablo will mean to anyone 
months or even years from now, I’m 
seeing it more and more as a record 
for kids and teenagers — one that 
stretches the realms of possibility 
and acts like the choking, authori-
tarian mainstream world is of no 
consequence and has never even 
existed. Kanye is Van Morrison cre-
ating tender, beautiful, nine-minute 
odes to drag queens on Astral 
Weeks or Wilco smashing the typi-
cal clichéd rock album to pieces on 
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but of course, 
he’s none of these things, because 
Kanye’s mind is truly unique and 
only he can approximate it to us 
through music.

If Kanye defines success as how 

real he can make his fantasies, Life 
of Pablo pushes him even higher. 
If he’s not untouchable, he’s at least 
in Beatles territory, continually 
forcing us to expand our definition 
of hip hop and pop music like the 
Fab Four did for pop and rock with 
Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. Listening 
to Life of Pablo, it’s obvious Kanye 
is still lost in the world, using his 
art and ambition to search for 
meaning in the disorienting dark-
ness of life. He’s not successful all 
the time, but along with Pablo’s 
garbage fires, the album also fea-
tures a few peak Kanye moments 
(namely “Ultralight Beam”) where 
you can feel that enlightenment 
just centimeters away from his 
outstretched fingers, and it makes 
for the most incredibly thrilling and 
challenging music I’ve ever heard. I 
hope Kanye never gets found.

‘Call Saul’ hits hard 
with gloomy reality

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Walter White (Bryan Crans-

ton, “Trumbo”) got to go out with 
a bang. The same cannot be said 
for his crooked 
lawyer 
Saul 

Goodman/
Jimmy McGill 
(Bob 
Oden-

kirk, “W/ Bob 
and 
David”). 

While the for-
mer 
Heisen-

berg 
died 
at 

the 
end 
of 

“Breaking Bad” 
blasting 
away 

neo-Nazis, 
embracing 
his infamy and earning some 
semblance of redemption, Saul 
resigned himself to a life of hid-
ing, toil and anonymity to avoid 
arrest.

Like the opening of its first 

season, “Better Call Saul” ’s season 
two premiere reacquaints us 
with Saul in his monochromatic 
purgatory as “Gene,” the manager 
of a Nebraska Cinnabon. There’s 
an 
inherent 
sadness 
in 
the 

mediocrity of Saul’s new life, 
with Odenkirk bearing the world-
weary weight of Gene. When 
Gene gets stuck in a dumpster 
room, with one door locked and 
the other set to alert police if 
opened, he becomes the man 
trapped in his own life, resigned 
to waiting for someone else to 
open the door.

This is the end for the man. 

And in that fact lies the ultimate 
tragedy of “Better Call Saul” 
— the inevitability of Jimmy 

McGill’s transformation into Saul 
Goodman and Saul eventually 
wearing the mask of Gene. It’s 
an endpoint the audience knows 
will inevitably come, but it 
doesn’t make the series any less 
intriguing.

“There’s no reward at the end 

of this game,” Jimmy muses to 
love interest Kim (Rhea Seehorn, 
“Whitney”) as the pair sits in the 
bar of the resort that Jimmy is 
staying in after turning down a 
position at a prestigious law firm. 
Jimmy is caught at a crossroads; 
it’s entirely possible to see the 
con man living the rest of his life 
scamming blowhards like Ken 
Wins (Kyle Bornheimer reprising 
his one-off role from “Breaking 
Bad”), but the decision has already 
been made. Every step Jimmy 
takes leads him towards Saul; 
there may be detours like the 
resort, but the destination is set. 
“Better Call Saul” is a tragicomedy. 
Sure, the characters are verbosely 
hilarious as creators Vince Gilligan 
(“Breaking Bad” ’s showrunner) 
and Peter Gould (“Too Big to Fail”) 
along with their writers insert 
amusing specificity and charm 
into every member of the cast. 
Underneath it all, though, is the 
sobering inevitability that, for at 
least some of these characters, the 
end will be far worse than where 
they began.

While the thoughtlessness of 

prescription drug dealer Daniel 
Warmolt (Mark Proksch, “The 
Office”) with his flame decaled 
Hummer 
H2 
and 
obsession 

with baseball cards is amusing, 
foreboding danger lurks right 
around 
the 
corner. 
Mike 

Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks, 

“Community”) may have walked 
away from being the fool’s hired 
muscle, but, as the audience 
knows, he can’t stay away forever. 
Like fellow “Breaking Bad” alum 
Odenkirk, 
Banks’s 
character’s 

future is firmly set in stone, no 
matter what he does.

Often framed within wide 

shots, the characters of “Better 
Call Saul” are made insignificant 
by the world around them and 
their 
own 
encroaching 
fate. 

Written and directed by Thomas 
Schnauz 
(“Reaper”), 
“Switch” 

may be offering a brief stoppage 
on the way to the endpoint, but 
the signs pointing towards it are 
there — whether it’s in the form of 
a minor “Breaking Bad” character 
like Ken or the literal signs that 
Jimmy often ignores in one life 
but cautiously obeys in the next.

When Jimmy finally accepts 

the position at the law firm of 
Davis and Main, it’s a continuation 
down the path that will end in 
tragedy. Davis and Main, with 
their company cars and cocobolo 
desks, will turn into a strip mall 
law firm with faux pillars and a 
blown up copy of the Constitution, 
which will also fade away. All 
roads lead to a dead-end Cinnabon 
in Nebraska — enjoy the ride while 
you can.

TV REVIEW

HBO show from 
legendary creators 
depicts life in the 

’70s fast lane

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

“Vinyl” reflects the legendary 

names heading its creation. Mar-
tin Scorsese and Terence Winter 
team up post-
“Boardwalk 
Empire” 
to 

produce anoth-
er 
powerful 

period 
piece. 

The 
lengthy 

series 
pre-

miere 
(nearly 

two 
hours) 

takes on the 
’70s New York 
music 
scene 

with countless 
depictions of coke-fueled antics, 
abounding sex and spectacular 
musical performances. In short, 
it abides by the sex, drugs and 
rock ‘n’ roll trope of the iconic 
rock era.

Though these elements are 

ubiquitous, they don’t define 
the show superficially. In the 
very first scene, Richie Fines-
tra (Bobby Cannavale, “Board-
walk Empire”), the once-great 
record producer around which 
the show centers, rips off his 
car’s rearview mirror to line up 
what we assume is the first coke 
he’s done in some time. This 
hook into the story suggests 
there is more to Richie than 
the staggering music producer 
we see at a moment of weak-
ness. And when office secretary 
Jamie Vine (Juno Temple, “The 
Dark Knight Rises”) sleeps with 
aspiring punk musician Kip Ste-
vens (James Jagger, “Mr. Nice”) 
after a particularly rowdy per-
formance by his band the Nasty 
Bits, she begins to mold him 
into a musician she can present 
to Richie to sign, indicating her 
ingenuity that exceeds her low 
rank on the industry totem pole.

The show is rooted in the par-

ticularities of an industry overrun 
with seedy characters and their 
unwholesome pastimes (includ-
ing ingesting a variety of drugs), 
but it doesn’t fall into the trap of 
glamorizing the lifestyle. Can-
navale’s powerful performance as 
Richie, the music exec with a sto-
ried past, illustrates this grounded 
storytelling. We’re taken back and 
forth between his humble begin-
nings in the music industry and 
his present day disillusionment as 
a man on the comedown from the 
pinnacle of his career. The story 
is told through Richie’s perspec-
tive, which he warns from the 
start may be blurred by his exces-
sive drug use and “bullshit.” His 
character is written masterfully 
by Terence Winter and George 
Mastras and executed poignantly 
by Cannavale.

After the first scene of Rich-

ie’s meltdown in his car, we learn 
what sparked the series of events 
leading to his moment of weak-
ness. As Richie and his partners 
Zak Yankovich (Ray Romano, 
“Everybody Loves Raymond”) 
and Skip Fontaine (J.C. MacK-
enzie, “The Departed”) sit at a 
conference room table with the 
German executives buying their 
floundering record label Ameri-
can Century, Richie’s voiceover 
briefly explains how he got to 
where he’s sitting and how he 
“earned his right to be hated” 
carrying kegs and cleaning up 
vomit before starting his own 
company. 
More 
importantly, 

the previous scene’s weight is 
made clear when Richie states, 
“I had a golden ear, silver tongue 
and brass balls. But the problem 
became my nose, and everything 
I put up it.”

Aside from the clever prose 

and cynicism towards the music 
business, the show is enhanced 
with beautifully executed cin-
ematography and a soundtrack 
carefully curated by show cre-
ator Mick Jagger himself. The 
rapid cutting and various angles 
of some of the more striking 
performances create a blur of 
leather pants, guitar thrash-
ing and headbanging that draw 
us into the performance as if 

we were one of the enthralled 
audience 
members 
attending 

the show ourselves. Scorsese’s 
style is stamped on to the show 
with dreamy interludes of well-
known musicians performing in 
Richie’s imagination, reflecting 
whatever emotions are cours-
ing through him at the same 
moment. That is the beauty 
of the show. It bonds together 
the music and its emotional 
response in a way that reflects 
the profound attachment Richie 
and other music fans have to 
their experiences with it.

The music of the period is 

infused into every moment of 
the show, from playing over the 
loudspeakers at American Cen-
tury’s offices to catching Richie’s 
attention as he passes a night-
club driving down the street. 
The music’s constant presence 
in the narrative is as much a 
part of Richie’s character as it is 
the show itself. His passion for 
music is delivered with such sin-
cerity that it makes his efforts to 
salvage his company by selling it 
all the more poignant. 

Richie’s devotion to his com-

pany and the world of music also 
creates a rift between his wife 
Devon (Olivia Wilde, “Rush”) 
and himself, who comes in 
second to the job he lives and 
breathes for. Like any middle 
aged executive with his glory 
days slipping away behind him, 
Richie is forced to look back at 
his past mistakes, including his 
neglect of his family, with tor-
mented questioning of what’s to 
come next. This struggle, along 
with an epic soundtrack, is what 
we have to look forward to as the 
series continues.

Wolverines fall to 
No. 6 Maryland in 
wild shootout in 

College Park

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

COLLEGE PARK — Much 

like in their first showdown 
on Jan. 12, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s rematch with 
No. 6 Maryland was nothing 
short of a heavyweight fight.

Each 
team 
rode 
multiple 

momentum shifts, with most 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
punches 

coming from junior forward 
Mark Donnal and sophomore 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, who combined for 41 
points. And after limiting guard 
Melo Trimble to two points in 
the last meeting, Michigan’s 
defense held him to 3-for-10 
shooting this time around.

But 
Maryland 
countered 

with its own one-two punch, 
composed of big men Diamond 
Stone and Robert Carter Jr. — 
who together scored 30 points 
and grabbed 11 boards — and 
also rode a strong effort from 
versatile wing Jake Layman, 
who made his first five shots of 
the game.

And this time around, the 

Terrapins 
punched 
harder, 

dashing the Wolverines’ chances 
of upsetting them for a second 
time this season. 

Trailing 82-79 with under 30 

seconds left, Michigan (9-6 Big 
Ten, 19-9 overall) had a chance 
to tie the game, but junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. was called 
for an offensive foul when he 
pushed off a Maryland defender 
under the basket. Despite a 
late 3-pointer from redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson, the Terrapins hung 
on, and Trimble — who scored 
seven of his 
14 points from 
the 
charity 

stripe — sealed 
an 
86-82 

victory 
from 

the free-throw 
line.

“Maryland 

was just better 
than us on too 
many 
plays 

to 
get 
the 

victory,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “We just didn’t have 
enough to get it done. Tough race 
down the stretch — ball didn’t 
bounce our way a couple times, 
other things didn’t go our way a 
couple times, and it just wasn’t 
enough to get the victory.”

Maryland (11-4, 23-5) had 

plenty of chances to pull away 
throughout, but the Wolverines 
wouldn’t 
let 
them. 
Donnal 

made all three of his attempts 
from beyond the arc in the 
game, at times singlehandedly 
carrying 
the 
offense 
and 

scoring six straight points in 
one memorable stretch.

“There’s another gear for 

Mark that you saw today,” 
Beilein said. “He’s got a fifth gear 
that can make him a really good 
college basketball player. ... I was 
dialing him up today — usually 
that hasn’t been as successful 
when I did that, but he’s ready 

to do that now. 
It changes our 
whole team.”

Abdur-

Rahkman 
also provided 
his 
share 

of 
heroics, 

stealing 
an 

inbounds 
pass 
midway 

through 
the 

second 
half 

and hitting a layup to give 
the Wolverines four points in 
seconds. He later was fouled on 
a made layup and knocked down 
the ensuing free throw to give 
Michigan a 73-72 lead — its last 
lead of the game before Carter 
won a tip drill at the rim to put

able to help her team capture a Big 
Ten title. She fell ill earlier in the 
week, putting the chance to swim 
at Canham for the last time as a 
senior in serious danger. 

But by the time the meet 

started, DeLoof was determined 
to compete. Not only did she 
swim, but she excelled and 
capped off her Big Ten career 
by anchoring the pool record-
setting 400-yard freestyle relay, 
with a time of 3:13.81.

“My freshman year, I didn’t 

think I was going to make it at all,” 
DeLoof said. “ ‘Those who stay 
will be champions’ — it’s really 
what’s been with me all year and 
even this week.”

Though 
the 
program 
had 

shown clear improvement this 
year, winning all but one of its dual 
meets, it was an underdog to the 
Hoosiers going into this weekend. 
Bottom and his team knew they 
needed to step up, and both 
swimmers and divers answered 
the bell.

In the 1,650-yard freestyle, 

freshman Yirong Bi bested her 
seed time by 20 seconds to finish 
second. Smiddy just missed a pool 
record in the 200-yard backstroke 
when she beat out Indiana’s 
Kennedy Goss to win the event. 
And the dive team impressed 
a sold-out Canham crowd by 

qualifying four divers for the 
platform finals.

Bottom, the long-time men’s 

coach, took control of the women’s 
team in 2012. He took over a 
team that had fallen off since the 
success of the early 2000s and was 
closer to the bottom of the Big Ten 
than the top. 

Drenched from his victory 

leap into the pool, Bottom was 
hit with a wave of emotions 
when talking about how far the 
program had come.

“It’s absolutely a dream to 

reality,” Bottom said. “Our first 
year, we didn’t have people in the 
final. I think we had two, maybe 
three people in any of the finals. 
Tonight, we had people in almost 
every final.”

For 
Bottom, 
getting 
this 

far was not only in his mind, 
but also in plain sight — the 
2004 Big Ten Championship 
banner has beckoned at every 
training session and every home 
meet during his time with the 
Wolverines. Every Saturday for 
the past four years, his team has 
stood under that banner and sang 
the Michigan fight song together. 

It took Bottom, DeLoof and 

the rest of the program four 
years to get there, but the hard 
work has paid off. Saturday, 
they could look at the banners 
on the wall, and for the first 
time in 12 years, know that 
there will be a new place to sing 
“The Victors.”

Mike Bottom’s ever-growing empire
T

uesday afternoon, 
one day before his 
women’s swimming and 

diving team won the Big Ten 
Championships in its home pool, 
Michigan 
coach Mike 
Bottom 
stood on the 
pool deck 
at Canham 
Natatorium, 
watching over 
his empire.

Right in 

front of him 
were the 
qualifiers for the Big Ten meet, 
and the ‘B’-level qualifiers for 
the NCAA Championships who 
didn’t make the Big Ten meet. On 
one wall, a clock counted down 
until this summer’s Olympics in 
Rio de Janeiro, and on the other 
side of the pool, Club Wolverine 
— the Olympic hopefuls training 
at Canham in preparation for this 
summer — swam alongside the 
current Wolverines.

“And this is just the men’s side,” 

Bottom said. “And then we have 
the women’s side of things ready 
to go here.”

Bottom and his swimming 

dynasty are well-established. 
Three years ago, his men’s team 
reached the peak of college 
swimming, winning the national 
championship. The previous 
summer, he coached in his fifth 
Olympics, putting him among the 
greatest swimming coaches in 
the world.

That year was the culmination 

of his previous journey. It was 
also the first year of his next one.

In the 2012-13 season, Bottom 

took over the women’s program 
in addition to the men’s. That 
year, while the men won the 
national title, the women were 
an afterthought, finishing 36th. 
There, Bottom found himself in 
an unfamiliar position.

“It wasn’t easy,” Bottom said 

Tuesday. “It wasn’t easy for me, 
and it wasn’t easy for the rest of 
the coaching staff. … Every time, 
our gut aches, just like everybody 
aches when you don’t do what you 
want to do as a team. But that’s 
OK. That’s sport.”

Coaching both teams also 

meant twice the work, twice 
the time commitment and twice 
the number of athletes. It’s a 
testament to Bottom’s methods 
that the men’s team won the 
national title in the first year he 
led both programs. The biggest 
challenge now, according to 
Bottom, is finding time with his 
three daughters, ages 10, 9 and 5.

Four years ago, he was already 

the successful head coach of a 
thriving men’s program. So why 
did he add the women’s program 
to his schedule? What, after 
five Olympics and a national 
championship, did he have left 
to prove?

“I don’t think I have anything 

to prove, right?” Bottom said. 
“I think at this point in my life, 
I’ve done what I’ve done. So I 
don’t feel like I need to prove 
(anything), but I feel like it’s an 
opportunity.”

The Big Ten title Michigan 

won at Canham Natatorium on 
Saturday seemed like a long shot 
four years ago. The year before 
Bottom took over the women’s 
program, the Wolverines finished 
eighth in the Big Ten and hadn’t 
won the conference since 2004.

Bottom believed the pieces 

were in place to reach that level 
again, but he had to bring the 
team to believe that it could do it. 
That wasn’t easy, though. After 
the meet Saturday, senior Ali 
DeLoof, whose first year was also 
Bottom’s, admitted she never 
thought she’d make it.

“Twenty hours a week in 

this pool, it hasn’t been easy,” 
DeLoof said. “It’s been a process. 
It’s tough to keep your head up 
sometimes, but you’ve got the 

girls motivating you every day, 
and I’m going to miss that.”

The Wolverines made 

incremental improvements every 
year, from 36th to 30th to 22nd at 
the NCAA Championships, from 
sixth to fifth to third in the Big 
Ten. As Bottom’s methods paid 
off, his swimmers bought in more 
and more each year.

But the last step was the 

toughest. As Bottom spoke 
Tuesday, Indiana entered 
Canham Natatorium. He ran the 
scores before the meet and wasn’t 
sure his team could beat the 
Hoosiers. Neither was his wife.

“She said, ‘Mike, you’re going 

to lose by 100 points,’ ” Bottom 
said Saturday. “I go, ‘Come on, 
sweetie, you gotta help me out 
here! Give me some confidence!’ ”

Going into Saturday, the 

fourth and final day of the 
championships, Michigan led 
Indiana by 45.5 points. Still, 
Bottom thought the Hoosiers 
could catch his team if things 
went wrong.

Saturday morning, in the 200-

yard backstroke, Marie Georger 
beat her seed time by 4.56 seconds 
to sneak into the ‘B’ finals, where 
she’d earn at least 11 points. In 
the 200-yard butterfly, Astrid 
Swensen did the same. It was then 
that Bottom knew his team could 
pull it off.

Senior captain Sarah Kamstra 

said the Wolverines went into 
the finals saying it was still 0-0. 
They did it to make sure they still 
fought until the end, but maybe it 
was also because they had never 
won before. Bottom spent four 
years building up all the belief he 
could in his team, but maybe just 
a hint of doubt remained until the 
victory was secure.

Around 8 p.m., with an hour 

still left in the meet, that moment 
came. Indiana had no divers left, 
and even if the Hoosiers won 
the final event — the 400-yard 
freestyle relay — and Michigan 

was disqualified, the Wolverines 
would still win.

Then Michigan won the relay 

by two seconds anyway.

So the final moments of the 

meet weren’t a conclusion as 
much as they were a coronation. 
The Wolverines stood on the pool 
deck as the conference handed 
out the relay awards, and then the 
individual awards, and then the 
other 12 team awards, one by one.

They wore shirts that 

read, “Those who stay will be 
champions,” because they all 
stayed, and they were champions. 
When the moment came, they 
ran up to the podium, giddily 
cheering and singing and dancing. 
They threw on their Big Ten 
Championship hats and shirts and 
posed for a photo. And then they 
dove in the pool.

“There (were) tears, and there 

was laughter,” Kamstra said. “And 
that was just something I’ll hold 
with me forever.”

Bottom dove in, too, just as he 

always does when his team wins 
a championship. Before he did, 
though, he spoke for a moment 
with associate coach Rick Bishop. 
He told Bishop to look at their 
swimmers’ faces.

“This has been a four-year 

process,” Bottom said. “Now, they 
can understand they’re champions. 
Not that they weren’t champions 
before this, but this solidifies it. And 
I said, ‘This will change their lives. 
They’ll have this moment in their 
lives forever.’ ”

That moment was what Bottom 

dreamed about when he took over 
the women’s program, no matter 
when it came, no matter how far 

it took to get there. Tuesday, on 
the cusp of that milestone, he was 
asked if he ever thought twice 
about it, about the early struggles 
or the long hours or the drain of 
the journey.

Just then, his 5-year-old 

daughter ran up to him on the pool 
deck and jumped into his arms, 
watching the swimmers along 
with him as he beamed with pride.

“Maybe, in a few years, I need 

to do something different,” he 
said. “But right now, the thrill of 
seeing these women get better, 
climb the ladder of success in 
their own lives … I get to be a part 
of that. That’s a thrill. That’s a 
thrill you can’t buy.”

‘M’ prevails on Senior Day

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Even though the Michigan 

band jeered, “We’re not Penn 
State” while the Nittany Lions 
took free throws, Penn State 
and 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team played strikingly 
similar. Both struggled to shoot 
from behind the arc, take care 
of the basketball and played 
through their stars.

But on the Wolverines’ Senior 

Day, Michigan outperformed 
its counterpart in the fourth 
quarter to pull off a 78-73 victory.

After the Wolverines started 

the game on a 10-3 run, the 
Nittany Lions called a timeout. 
After the Penn State players 
stepped onto the floor again, 
their 
defensive 
pressure 

intensified, bringing the action 
more up-tempo.

Michigan, a team that usually 

prefers to play in transition, looked 
rushed with the change of pace as 
it missed a wide open layup, turned 
the ball over six times and missed 
five 3-pointers in the first quarter 
alone to fall behind, 17-15, at the 
end of the period.

Both the Wolverines and 

Nittany Lions struggled to make 
baskets as both suffered from 
shots rimming out and poor shot 
selection. Midway through the 
second quarter, Michigan was 
shooting 33 percent (8-for-24) 
and Penn State was shooting 
at a 35 percent clip (7-for-20). 
To add to the lackluster start, 
the Wolverines made careless 
passes in transition, stunting 
opportunities 
to 
develop 
a 

rhythm when they were not 
making baskets to begin with.

“In the first half we struggled 

with wide open shots. I don’t 
think we’ve been that wide open 
all year,” said sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty.

Michigan ended the half down 

37-32, but it took momentum 
into the locker room as Flaherty 
knocked down a jump shot to beat 
the buzzer. The shot capped off 
an average half for Flaherty, who 
had nine points but also three 
turnovers. The Wolverines had 11 
turnovers in the first half, nearing 
their average of 15.4 a game.

After 
junior 
guard 
Siera 

Thompson fired a pass that was 
intercepted by a Nittany Lion 
to give Penn State a 5-0 run to 
start the third quarter, Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico called a 
timeout as the coaches met up 
separately from the team before 
grouping up as a whole.

“In the first half we got a 

lot of shots and we couldn’t 
get a lot of those shots to fall, 
and that was 
discouraging 
and 
affected 

us 
on 
the 

defensive 
end,” 
Barnes 

Arico 
said. 

“We still came 
out 
flat 
to 

start the third 
quarter, 
so 

when we came 
out, 
I 
just 

told them that they had to give 
better effort.”

Thompson 
followed 
her 

mistake 
with 
a 
3-pointer, 

giving Michigan the jolt it 
needed to cut the deficit to two 
by the next timeout. After an 
and-1 by sophomore forward 
Jillian Dunston and a 3-pointer 
by 
freshman 
guard 
Boogie 

Brozoski, the Wolverines took 

the lead with 3:35 left in the 
third quarter.

The Nittany Lions took a 

55-52 lead going into the fourth 
quarter, but Michigan ended the 
third quarter on a 20-12 run.

Freshman 
center 
Hallie 

Thome began the fourth quarter 
with an off-balance and-1 to tie 
the game. Flaherty backed up 
the effort with a 3-pointer to 
continue the hot start. Three 

minutes later, 
Flaherty 
knocked down 
another 
3 

to 
give 
the 

Wolverines 
a 

six-point lead.

“I 
think 

once one of us 
gets going — 
today it was 
me 
— 
that 

everyone gets 

more confident and shots start 
to fall all around,” Flaherty said.

Added Barnes Arico: “In the 

fourth quarter, our team did a 
great job of finding Katelynn, 
who has such a high percentage 
shooting, and Hallie and got her 
touches inside … We really found 
them and that was important 
for us to be able to score the 
basketball better.”

Penn State had an opportunity 

to tie the game with just under 
three minutes left in the game, 
but the layup attempt rimmed 
out. 
On 
Michigan’s 
next 

possession, 
Flaherty 
struck 

again from behind the arc for 
her fifth 3-pointer of the game. 
She ended with 30 points. On 
the Wolverines’ next possession, 
senior guard Madison Ristovski 
sunk a floater at the buzzer to 
give Michigan a seven-point lead.

“There were only five seconds 

left on the clock and I was like, 
‘I missed all day, maybe I’ll try 
one more time,’ ” Ristovski said. 
“It was cool because I beat it off 
the buzzer, but I think it was at a 
really important time in the game. 
We were in a scoring drought and 
I had no idea. I’m happy it helped 
propel the team to win.”

Dunston stepped up to the line 

with the Wolverines up by four, 
but missed both free throws. 
The Nittany Lions attempted 
to cut the lead to one, but the 
3-point 
attempted 
touched 

nothing but air. Penn State’s next 
desperation 3-pointer wouldn’t 
fall either.

In the waning minute, Flaherty 

was fouled and made both of her 
free throws. The band chanted to 
the Nittany Lions, “See ya.”

Wolverines open season with sweep of Canisius

Michigan posts 

first 4-0 start since 

2009 season

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

In each of the Michigan 

baseball team’s previous three 
seasons under coach Erik Bakich, 
the opening weekend was always 
one to forget.

The 2016 edition will be just 

the opposite. The 15th-ranked 
Wolverines won all four games 
in the series against Canisius, 
9-0 Friday, 6-2 and 3-0 Saturday 
and 9-3 Sunday. It’s the first time 
Michigan has started 4-0 since 
2009.

“The momentum that was 

created (this weekend) was a 
byproduct of our training, and 
the consistency of our efforts on 
a daily basis,” Bakich said.

The Wolverines put away 

Friday’s contest quickly, putting 
up four runs in the first inning. 

It all started when sophomore 

shortstop Jake Bivens hit a 
leadoff single to right field. 
Senior Matt Ramsay followed 
up with a single of his own to 
put runners on first and second 
base.

Two 
batters 
later, 
senior 

outfielder Cody Bruder singled 
with the bases loaded and one 
out to drive in two runs. Then 
fellow junior outfielder Johnny 
Slater hit his own RBI double 
to extend Michigan’s lead to 
three. Junior designated hitter 
Harrison 
Wenson 
added 
a 

sacrifice fly to center to put the 
Wolverines ahead, 4-0.

Michigan later accumulated 

a four-run sixth inning and a 
one-run eighth frame to round 
out Friday. Every batter for the 
Wolverines either notched an 
RBI or scored a run.

“To see (the offense) have 

success, get on base, run hard 
on the bases and create scoring 
opportunities 
was 
really 

exciting.” Bakich said. “Our 
team was very engaged and 
invested in one another. I liked 
the positivity, I liked the energy 
and I liked the execution.”

But it was junior left-handed 

pitcher 
Brett 

Adcock 
who 

was the star of 
Friday’s show. 
He 
pitched 

5.1 
scoreless 

innings, 
allowed three 
hits and struck 
out 
seven. 

Sophomore 
right-hander 
Jayce Vancena 
came on for 1.2 innings of 
scoreless relief and freshman 
right-hander Troy Miller pitched 
the final two innings.

“We got quality starts from 

all four guys who started (this 
weekend),” Bakich said. “We got 
quality relief pitching, too. I was 
very happy to see the way our 
pitching staff competed.”

The first game of Saturday’s 

doubleheader 
started 
out 

differently 
than 
Friday’s 

contest 
as 

Canisius 
scored 
an 

unearned run 
in the top of 
the first, but 
Michigan 
quickly dashed 
the 
Golden 

Griffins’ hopes.

With two outs in the bottom 

of the first, junior outfielder 
Carmen Benedetti hit a single to 
right field. Sophomore infielder 

Drew Lugbauer followed up 
with another single to put two 
runners on base.

“(Lugbauer) still made some 

of the loudest contact of anyone 
with deep drives to the warning 
track,” Bakich said. “Even though 
his statistics from this weekend 
are solid, they don’t show how 
well he really hit this weekend.”

Sophomore 
right-handed 

pitcher Ryan Nutof earned the 
win in Saturday’s first game. 
He pitched four innings, kept 
the Golden Griffins hitless and 
only surrendered one unearned 
run while striking out two. 
Sophomore right-hander Michael 
Hendrickson came on for three 
innings of relief, permitting only 
one run on three hits and earning 
a save in the process.

While 
Michigan 
scored 

just three runs in the second 

game of the doubleheader, four 
Wolverine 
pitchers 
ensured 

that the offense’s support was 
sufficient.

Senior left-hander Evan Hill 

started things off by pitching 
four scoreless frames, striking 
out one and allowing six hits. 
After that, freshman southpaw 
William 
Tribucher, 
junior 

right-hander Mac Lozer, and 
sophomore righty Bryan Pall 
combined 
for 
five 
shut-out 

innings of relief.

“When the pitching is as 

dominant as it was this weekend, 
it’s a huge pump-up for our 
offense.” Bruder said. “I have to 
give credit to (the pitchers).”

But Michigan’s offense came 

roaring back alive in the first two 
innings of Sunday’s game.

In the first frame, Bivens 

singled up the middle to lead 

off the inning and Ramsay 
immediately followed up with 
another single. A sacrifice fly 
by junior outfielder Carmen 
Benedetti put runners on first 
and third with one out.

Two unforced mistakes by 

Canisius turned into two runs for 
the Wolverines. A balk allowed 
Bivens to score and a throwing 
error two batters later allowed 
Ramsay to score after stealing 
third base.

Slater opened up the second 

inning by singling to right field. 
Wenson then launched a home 
run to left field on the next at-bat 
to put Michigan up, 4-0. The 
Wolverines scored one more 
time in the inning to extend the 
lead to five.

An RBI single by Bruder and 

a sacrifice fly from Wenson in 
the fifth created even more 
separation for the Wolverines. 
Bruder again singled in the 
eighth to drive in a run and 
give Michigan a 9-3 advantage. 
Bruder finished Sunday with 
three hits in five at-bats, one run 
scored and two RBI.

“I got to give credit to the 

people in front of me for setting 
the table,” Bruder said. “Coach 
Bakich always had a good game 
plan for us going in.”

Perhaps 
the 
lone 
blemish 

from the weekend was the fact 
that the Wolverines’ defense 
committed four errors Sunday, 
which turned into three runs for 
the Golden Griffins. Yet Bakich 
believed the performance was an 
anomaly in an otherwise strong 
series for the defense. Michigan 
committed two errors in the 
other three contests.

“For the first three games, the 

defense was elite,” Bakich said. 
“We had some issues (Sunday). 
I don’t think our defense is 
outstanding, but it’s very good.”

While there are still plenty 

of 
challenges 
ahead 
during 

conference 
play, 
the 
sweep 

of Canisius was certainly a 
momentum-booster 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Cody Bruder capped a strong opening weekend for the Michigan baseball team by going 3-for-5 with a run scored and two RBI on Sunday against Canisius.

“Our team was 
very engaged 
and invested in 
one another.”

‘M’ cruises in 
weekend wins

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

Only one run separated the 

Michigan softball team and No. 
13 Florida State heading into the 
seventh inning Friday night. The 
Seminoles scored a run in the 
bottom of the sixth inning to cut 
Michigan’s lead to one.

Then, the top of the second-

ranked Wolverines’ lineup came 
up to bat.

After senior centerfielder Sierra 

Lawrence reached first base on an 
error, the stage was set for senior 
second basemen Sierra Romero to 
make her mark.

Despite 
being 
hitless 
in 

three at-bats, Romero quickly 
put those struggles to bed as 
she launched a home run over 
the right-field fence, giving the 
Wolverines a 5-2 lead.

Michigan 
scored 
another 

insurance run in the inning, 
giving fifth-year right hander Sara 
Driesenga all the help she needed 
to close out the game and give the 
Wolverines (8-1) a 6-2 victory over 
the Seminoles.

“We expect things to be 

close,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “It was a tight game, but 
we kept swinging away.”

That set the tone for the 

Wolverines’ 
4-0 
weekend 
in 

which two wins came against 
Florida State.

After Friday night’s explosive 

finish, the Wolverines regrouped 
for a Saturday matchup against 
Virginia Tech, a team they beat 3-1 
last weekend.

Saturday’s matinee, in stark 

contrast to the night before, 
was smooth sailing as junior 
right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa 

and sophomore right-hander 
Tera Blanco stifled the Hokies’ 
hitters at every turn to ensure 
a 6-1 win. The pair combined 
to record nine strikeouts while 
only allowing one hit.

With the pitching staff locked 

in, Michigan’s hitters soon also 
found themselves in rhythm in the 

bottom of the third inning.

Romero hit another two-run 

home run, with Lawrence crossing 
the plate first again. Then, hits 
started pouring in as Blanco 
singled, sophomore catcher Aidan 
Falk ripped a hit into center field, 
and freshman infielder Faith 
Canfield notched an RBI. The big 
inning propelled the Wolverines 
to a victory.

“(Lawrence) getting on base 

is critical for our offense,” 
Hutchins said. “When she is 
doing her part of leadoff hitter, it 
really helps our offense.”

Saturday night brought another 

date with Florida State as the 
host Seminoles looked to even 
their series with Michigan. But 
the Wolverines weren’t fazed, 
continuing to hit the ball well in 
the third inning.

Falk, continuing her strong 

weekend play, got the big inning 
going 
with 
a 
single. 
Junior 

shortstop Abby Ramirez followed 
Falk’s single with a hit, and 
sophomore 
infielder 
Amanda 

Vargas tallied up a single of her 
own as the runs started to pile 
up. By the end of the half-inning, 
Michigan built up a 6-0 lead to take 
all of Florida State’s momentum. 
Driesenga and Betsa dealt with 
the Seminoles’ lineup with ease as 
the Wolverines won, 10-3.

Sunday morning dealt the 

Wolverines a familiar opponent 
in Virginia Tech. From the start, it 
was not close.

A Lawrence hit, a Ramirez 

triple, a Romero single and a RBI 
line drive from Sobczak got the 
Wolverines off to a roaring start. 
The entire lineup came up to bat in 
the inning.

Driesenga put an exclamation 

point on her fine weekend, 
tossing six innings of nearly 
flawless softball, racking up three 
strikeouts and only giving up one 
earned run.

Freshman right-hander Leah 

Crockett made her collegiate debut 
in the seventh inning and closed 
out a 9-1 win for the Wolverines.

Michigan upsets Tar Heels

Wolverines rally 
past No. 2 North 
Carolina at home

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 8 Michigan women’s 

tennis team knew it was going 
to be tough to beat No. 2 North 
Carolina 
(10-2), and 
they 
were 

excited 
and ready from the first serve. 
In the end, it was Michigan’s 
dynamic bond that gave them 
the 5-2 victory.

The 
doubles 
teams 
were 

active at the net, knowing they 
needed to control the points if 
they wanted to win. Every point 
was a battle, but eventually the 
Wolverines (6-2) put enough 
points 
away 
to 
clinch 
the 

doubles point.

With the No. 1 doubles team 

of freshman Brienne Minor 
and sophomore Mira Ruder-
Hook only one point away 
from beating the Tar Heels’ 
No. 1 doubles team, which is 
ranked No. 1 in the nation, 
Minor produced a big serve that 
immediately put North Carolina 
on 
defense. 

Both players 
charged 
the 

net, 
giving 

them an easy 
volley to end 
the match.

With 

Ruder-Hook 
and Minor winning, 6-4, the 
Wolverines needed only one 
more team to take the doubles 
point.

The No. 3 doubles team, made 

up of junior Sara Remynse and 
freshman Teona Velehorschi, 
officially secured the doubles 

point 
after 
winning 
the 

tiebreaker, 7-4.

For 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 

lineup, the momentum from 
the doubles carried into their 
singles 
matches. 
Sophomore 

Alex Najarian took advantage 
of her fresh legs at No. 5 singles 
and came out fired up.

She was two games away from 

winning 
the 

match 
and 

it 
was 
clear 

to 
anyone 
in 

earshot that she 
was ready to 
end it. Screams 
of 
“Go 
Blue” 

or 
“Come 

On” 
echoed 
throughout 
the 

Varsity Tennis Center. Najarian 
dominated her opponent and was 
the first to finish with a score of 
6-3, 6-4.

“It’s hard to play people when 

they’re not being as loud to try and 
get yourself to be loud,” Najarian 

said, “But having the energy of my 
teammates helps a lot.”

With a comeback win from 

junior Sara Remynse, Michigan 
only needed one more win to 
take the whole match. It was a 
race between freshman Kate 
Fahey and Ruder-Hook to seal 
the win first. The honor was left 
to the freshman.

Fahey was at match point as 

she ran toward the net. She left 
the ball to land out and locked 
in the Wolverines’ win on a Tar 
Heel unforced error. While her 
teammates rushed to celebrate 
the upset, North Carolina’s 
Jessie Aney threw her racket in 
the air in defeat.

“Just for the bottom of our 

lineup to come through today 
was huge,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “This is a team 
win for sure. Everybody stepped 
up today, and that’s what it is. 
It’s going to take a team, it’s not 
going to take a couple kids.”

Freshman Kate Fahey scored the point that clinched the Wolverines’ 5-2 victory over No. 2 North Carolina at the Varsity Tennis Center on Saturday.

win for sure.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Maryland back on top for good.

The game had the makings of 

a shootout from the beginning. 
Both teams traded blows to start 
the game tied at 12 points apiece, 
with Robinson — who hit five 
3-pointers in the Wolverines’ 
upset of the Terrapins in January 
— scoring seven quick points and 
showing off a rare inside game 
with two layups.

But after a seven-and-a-half-

minute stretch in which Michigan 
missed 13 straight field goals and 
fell victim to a 17-1 Maryland run, 
the contest took on the look of the 
Wolverines’ blowout home losses 
to Indiana and Michigan State 
two weeks ago.

This time, though, Michigan 

refused to allow the first-half 
run to put the nail in its coffin. 
Walton started cold, but he ended 
the Terrapins’ scoring run with a 
layup and later picked Trimble’s 
pocket for a contested fast-break 
layup as part of a 7-0 Wolverine 
run. Walton and seldom-used 
sophomore 
forward 
Kam 

Chatman also knocked down two 
3-pointers apiece late in the half 
to leave Michigan trailing by just 
five points heading into the break.

“I’m proud of our kids, the 

way they battled (after) we got 
ourselves in a little trouble in 
the first half,” Beilein said. 
“Thank goodness, because that 
thing can go the wrong way very 
quickly in this building and with 
their team.”

The Wolverines ended up 

showing a similar fight right 
until the end, outscoring the 
Terrapins in the second half, 
but it wasn’t enough to secure 
a potential NCAA Tournament 
résumé-boosting win with just 
three games remaining on the 
regular-season schedule.

The loss was the end of two 

notable streaks for Michigan. 
With Walton’s offensive foul 
marking his fifth of the game, 
it was the first time all season a 
Wolverine has fouled out; it was 
also the first time Michigan has 
lost under Beilein when scoring 
80 points or more.

Donnal’s effort falls short again

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

COLLEGE PARK — Mark 

Donnal was the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s best option on 
Sunday, and it almost worked.

After a game-high 17-point 

performance in a losing effort 
Tuesday 
against 
Ohio 
State, 

Donnal had the game’s best mark 
again against No. 6 Maryland in 
another road loss.

The junior forward hit only one 

field goal — a 3-pointer — in the 
first half at the Xfinity Center, but 
Donnal got hot early in the second 
frame and went off for 22 points, 
finishing with a game-high 25.

After the Terrapins pushed 

out to a 16-point lead with eight 
minutes left in the first half, the 
Wolverines started to chip away, 
eventually cutting the lead down 
to six points with just more than 
a minute left. Maryland tried to 
extend the lead back to double 
digits before halftime, but two 
big blocks from Donnal late in 
the frame kept Michigan within 
arm’s reach heading into the 
locker room.

To kick off the second half, 

sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
found 

Donnal twice early in the paint 
for two quick buckets. Donnal 
fought through contact on the 
second attempt to help Michigan 
cut the lead to just three.

“They kind of played uphill off 

the ball screens,” Donnal said. “So 
we knew the late drop-off pass 
was going to be there, so that’s 
kind of something we emphasized 
at halftime.”

A 
possession 
later, 
after 

a 
Maryland 
basket, 
Donnal 

got open from beyond the arc 
and knocked down his second 
3-pointer of the game. He went 
3-for-4 from deep in the game 
after entering it shooting just 25 
percent from 3-point range.

“I hit my first (3-pointer), and it 

gave Coach the confidence to draw 
up the same play,” Donnal said. 
“He gave me some good looks, and 

we were able to execute.”

But despite Donnal hitting 

from inside the paint and behind 
the arc, Maryland continued to 
take it to him on the other side. 
After his made triple, 6-foot-11 
center Diamond Stone bullied 
him down low, putting in an easy 
bucket of his own.

Donnal 
kept 
playing 

aggressively, though, even as 
Michigan’s only weapon to combat 
Maryland’s size. Five minutes into 
the half, Abdur-Rahkman found 
Donnal again, and the big man 
slammed down a dunk, giving the 
Wolverines their first lead since 
early in the first half. He nailed 
another 3-pointer one minute 
later, and when he got fouled down 
low two possessions after that, he 
hit both of his free throws to keep 
Michigan ahead by a point.

Perhaps his impact was best 

felt when he was off the court. 

When Donnal picked up his 
third foul with 12:30 left in the 
second half, Michigan coach John 
Beilein opted to sub in sophomore 
forward Ricky Doyle. Maryland 
took advantage of Donnal’s time 
on the bench, picking up four 
quick points in the paint.

“We didn’t keep him out for 

that long, but yeah (it was hard to 
take him out),” Beilein said. “His 
defense on Stone was good — he’s 
strong. He’s got more experience, 
but he’s going to have to have a rest 
anyhow. The way the wrestling 
match is down inside, he’s going 
to have to have a rest whether he’s 
hot or not. Your big men have to 
get a little bit of an extra breather 
that the other guys don’t get.”

Doyle filled in for just three 

minutes before Donnal reentered. 
Donnal picked up right where he 
left off and used two quick layups 
to cut an eight-point Terrapin lead 

to just four.

But Donnal couldn’t handle all 

of Maryland’s size himself. With 
five minutes left in the second half 
and Michigan up one, Maryland 
forward Robert Carter Jr. put up 
a close-range jumper. The shot 
missed, but Donnal was outsized 
by 6-foot-11 forward Damonte 
Dodd. Dodd grabbed the board 
and put up a shot of his own 
from inside the paint. This time, 
he missed, and Carter grabbed 
another 
Maryland 
offensive 

board. Carter went up again, 
putting in an easy bucket from 
point-blank range.

The Wolverines actually had 

the edge in offensive rebounds, 
12-9, but Maryland capitalized 
on its second chances more, 
scoring 13 second-chance points 
to Michigan’s eight.

The Carter bucket reclaimed 

the lead for the Terrapins, and 

they never looked back, closing 
out Michigan down the stretch 
for an 86-82 win.

For Donnal, though, Maryland 

marked his second straight game 
as Michigan’s most productive 
player. Along with his 25 points, 
he also picked up five rebounds 
and five blocks.

It didn’t change the end result 

for Michigan — another Big 
Ten loss on the road — but for 
Donnal it appears to be changing 
his confidence. After losing his 
starting job just three games into 
the season before working his way 
back into the starting five after 
a big performance in Michigan’s 
Big Ten opener at Illinois, Donnal 
has established himself as far and 
away the Wolverines’ best option 
down low on both sides of the floor. 

Against Maryland’s physicality, 

though, Michigan’s best wasn’t 
enough.

Junior forward Mark Donnal exploded for 22 points in the second half to try to lead Michigan from behind Sunday at Maryland, but the Wolverines fell, 86-82.

Compher powers top line
W

ith the Michigan 
hockey team on the 
power play against 

Ferris State on Friday night, 
junior 
forward JT 
Compher 
cradled a 
pass from 
fellow junior 
forward Alex 
Kile and rifled 
the puck 
toward the 
net.

Bulldog 

netminder 
Darren Smith got a pad on 
Compher’s shot, but the rebound 
went right across the crease to 
freshman forward Kyle Connor, 
who buried the puck upstairs 
past a sprawling Smith.

Connor’s goal gave him 50 

points on the year, a massive 
accomplishment for the freshman 
phenom, and his teammates 
surrounded him to give 
congratulatory pats on the back.

But lost in the commotion 

was another milestone. With 
his second assist of the game, 
Compher, Michigan’s captain, 
hit 100 points in his career 
and became the first junior to 
do so since Carl Hagelin, who 
currently plays in the National 
Hockey League with the 
Pittsburgh Penguins, in 2010. 
The assist propelled Compher 
to tie New Hampshire’s Tyler 
Kelleher for first in the NCAA 
in helpers.

Unlike a week ago, when 

senior forward Boo Nieves 
scored his 100th point, there 
was no fanfare. A public 
announcement came and went 
with little crowd applause.

And that’s fine to Compher. 

That’s how it’s been all year.

While his linemates put up 

flashy goal totals — Motte has 
scored in 12 straight games 
and Connor has 51 points on 
the season — Compher doesn’t 
get enough recognition for the 
intangibles he provides to the 
line.

On a line with two of the 

most prolific goal scorers in the 
country, some could argue that 

Compher is the most important 
member of the line. He’s a key cog 
in a very well-oiled machine.

There’s no one reason that’s 

the case. And that’s the point. 
Compher does a multitude of 
things very well.

Compher does the dirty work. 

He gets to loose pucks in the 
corner, and he retrieves pucks on 
dump-ins. He gets the pucks that 
give his line mates chances to pad 
their goal totals.

That’s not saying that the 

Motte and Connor don’t do the 
dirty work. But as the center 
on the line, Compher’s job is to 
facilitate, and he’s one of the best 
in the nation at doing just that.

“JT demands the puck, and 

he’s got speed,” said Michigan 
assistant coach Bill Powers. “He 
can carry it, and he sees the ice 
exceptionally well. So you have 
a centerman that doesn’t have 
a weakness, and the other two 
players feed off him.”

Take for example, Motte’s 

first goal of the weekend against 
Wisconsin.

Compher retrieved a loose 

puck just inside the blue line 
with his back to the goal. Before 
he turned, though, Compher 
saw a streaking Motte cutting 
behind two Badger defensemen. 
He spun around and fired a pass 
straight to Motte, who banged it 
home to give Michigan the one-
goal advantage.

The play exemplified 

everything Compher does on 
the line. His hustle, vision and 
skill make him the perfect third 
linemate for Motte and Connor.

“The one thing that you really 

look to our lines is the center on 
the line dictates so much because 
everything starts with him on 
the faceoff,” Powers said. “A lot of 
time, the puck gets to the middle 
of the rink. So that’s our centers 
getting the puck in the middle 
of the rink, so when Kyle and 
Tyler get the puck, a lot of times, 
it is dictated by a puck-carrying 
centerman.”

Earlier in the week, when 

Compher was asked about which 
player on his prolific line should 
win the Hobey Baker Award, 
given annually to the best college 

hockey player in the nation, 
Compher didn’t have an answer.

“We haven’t talked about 

anything like that,” Compher 
said Monday. “That’s out of our 
control and not something we 
worry about.”

But Compher should be in 

the conversation. You could 
even make a pretty convincing 
argument that Compher should 
be the frontrunner.

Not only is Compher a big 

reason why the CCM line is 
playing well; he is also one of — if 
not the best — penalty killer on 
the team.

With penalty killing, a lot of 

success comes from working 
harder than your opponent to get 
the puck and send it down the 
ice. Compher does that better 
than any player on the team. He 
doesn’t take one play off.

“There’s no way JT shouldn’t 

be in the discussion (for the 
Hobey Baker),” Powers said. “Is 
JT the third wheel on that line? 
No, he’s as important as the 
other two.”

Added Motte: “His impact 

freshman year all the way 
through now has been 
unbelievable for the program. 
The guy works hard every day. 
I can’t give him enough credit 
for what he’s done, not only 
individually, but for the team as 
well.”

Compher has never put 

personal accomplishments 
before team accomplishments, 
not at Team Illinois, not at the 
United States National Team 
Development Program and 
certainly not now Michigan.

And with Compher on the cusp 

of leading the Wolverines to their 
first NCAA Tournament in three 
years, the tournament berth will 
probably feel a whole lot better 
than hitting 100 career points 
Friday night.

Because the fact of the matter 

is, Compher isn’t just a key cog 
on his own line. He’s the engine 
that keeps Michigan’s scoring 
machine running smoothly.

‘M’ beats Ferris State

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Oct. 23, 1992.
Back 
when 
the 
Michigan 

hockey team was still a part of the 
CCHA. Back when the Wolverines 
put together 
their third 
consecutive 
NCAA 
Tournament appearance, before 
stringing together another 19 
afterwards. 
And 
back 
when 

Michigan coach Red Berenson 
faced coach Bob Daniels for the 
first time.

Now fast forward to Friday 

night, 23 seasons later, and take a 
look at the two benches. There are 
the players — some in white and 
blue, the others in all red — but 
they come and go over the years. 
So take a look behind them, and 
you will find something that has 
stayed the same.

Berenson, 
behind 
his 

Wolverines, and Daniels, behind 
Ferris State. For the 63rd time.

No one knows if this is 

Berenson’s last season at the helm 
of Michigan’s hockey program yet. 
But if this season is his farewell 
tour, it’s fitting that he’ll be able to 

leave with a win against the team 
the Wolverines have faced every 
year since 1982.

No. 6 Michigan took the lead 

just under six minutes into the 
first period and didn’t relinquish 
it the rest of the night, cruising to 
a 5-2 victory against the Bulldogs 
and giving Berenson his 43rd 
win against Daniels — the most 
against any coach he has faced.

“It’s 
a 
good 
relationship,” 

Berenson said. “He came in — he 
had his daughter with him this 
morning — and we had a long talk 
about how it’s going in the WCHA 
and how their team is doing.

“And his teams play hard. They 

don’t hand over the games to 
Michigan. But we’ve had maybe 
one or two more players that could 
get us over the top — difference 
maker players or players that 
could score that might have made 
the difference.”

But Berenson’s 63rd meeting 

against Daniels wasn’t the only 
piece of history that happened 
Friday night.

Just over 12 minutes into the 

second 
period, 
Ferris 
State’s 

Ryan Lowney went to the box for 
slashing. It took just 49 seconds 
on for freshman forward Kyle 

Connor to make the Bulldogs pay 
for the penalty. Connor coolly 
put away a rebound from junior 
forward JT Compher’s shot — the 
captain’s assist marked his 100th 
point in a maize and blue sweater, 
making him the first junior to 
reach the milestone since Carl 
Hagelin in 2010.

But after Connor found twine 

to give the Wolverines a 3-1 lead, 
Michigan cruised until the final 
horn sounded.

The Wolverines added two 

more to their goal tally off the 
sticks of Connor and sophomore 
defenseman Zach Werenski. It 
took Werenski just 90 seconds 
in the third period before he 
singlehandedly carried the puck 
in on goal from the offensive 
blue line and netted a backhand. 
Connor’s goal, on the other 
hand, required some help. Junior 
forward Tyler Motte carried 
the puck into the offensive zone 
before feeding freshman forward 
Cooper Marody in the left circle. 
After tapping the puck off his right 
skate, Marody reversed direction 
and sent a perfect pass sailing 
toward his fellow freshman. 
Connor finished the chance easily 
to put an exclamation point on 
Michigan’s victory.

Though Ferris State responded 

with the final goal of the game, 
senior goaltender Steve Racine 
and the Wolverine blueliners 
put together a unified stand 
throughout the matchup. The 
senior netminder made a number 
of critical and acrobatic stops in 
front, tallying 24 in total.

There’s no telling if this is the 

last year Berenson will be on 
Michigan’s bench. But if it is, he 
got to watch his junior captain 
write his name in program 
history. He got to face Bob Daniels 
one last time. And he got one last 
victory against him.

So if it is the last time Berenson 

coaches on a bench opposite of 
Daniels’, that’s not a bad way to 
cap off a friendly rivalry.

“He’s successful because he’s 

very loyal to his players, and I 
believe his players are very loyal 
to him,” Daniels said. “I think the 
world of Red, and I think he’s a 
great coach. If you want to try to 
emulate someone, he’s your guy.”
