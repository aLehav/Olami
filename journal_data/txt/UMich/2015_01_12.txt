Mice fed crumbs 
from local eatery 
to examine yeast, 
sugar digestion

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

When Ann Arbor locals think 

of Zingerman’s, they are most 

likely not considering the estab-
lishment as a beacon for medical 
advancement.

However, bread from Zinger-

man’s Bakehouse contributed to 
a new study involving intestinal 
bacteria and its role in curing 
intestinal and autoimmune dis-
eases such as yeast infections and 
Crohn’s disease.

The study, co-conducted by a 

University professor, found that 
certain bacteria in the intestines 

— namely one strain called Bacte-
roides thetaiotomicron — are able 
to digest sugars on the surface 
of yeast, a large and unique com-
ponent of the human diet. These 
sugars have previously been dis-
covered to exacerbate many of the 
symptoms of common intestinal 
diseases.

CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Mayor officiates 

ceremony as 

fire department 

welcomes new head

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor’s new fire chief is 

preparing to set the city ablaze 
with plans to improve its fire-

fighting unit.

Friday morning, members of 

the Ann Arbor Fire Department, 
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment and the Ann Arbor City 
Council gathered for the inaugu-
ration of the city’s new fire chief, 
Larry Collins.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor (D) served as master of 
the ceremony, which took place 
at the Ann Arbor Fire Depart-
ment on North Fifth Avenue.

Taylor said he was excited to 

welcome Collins to Ann Arbor, 
who had previously served as fire 
chief for the Brevard County Fire 
Rescue in Florida since 2009.

“It’s a tremendous day for Ann 

Arbor to welcome a new chief,” 
Taylor said. “I want to say, chief, 
that I think you’ll like it here 
in Ann Arbor. I think you’ll be 
proud, and you will value your 
colleagues in the fire department 
because they are dedicated, pro-
fessional, and work hard every 
day to protect us.”

Taylor stressed the impor-

tance of the Ann Arbor Fire 
Department in maintaining the 
city’s mission of maintaining the 
quality of life of its citizens.

“At its core, basic services are 

what this city is all about, and 
at the core of basic services, of 
course, is fire, and police, and 
law enforcement.”

Governor gains 
national media 

attention ahead of 

2016 primaries

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Following his reelection and 

the success of several of his 
state economic reforms, several 
national media outlets have float-
ed Republican Gov. Rick Snyder 
as a contender in a crowded field 
of potential GOP presidential can-
didates.

Snyder sparked national media 

attention after he visited Wash-
ington, D.C. in early December 
to accept Governing Magazine’s 
award for Public Official of the 
Year. During the trip, he said he 
hoped to visit more places around 
the country to tell the story of 
Michigan’s recovery.

Several major national media 

outlets have since run stories 
about Snyder’s prospects, includ-
ing Politico and The Washington 

Post.

However, the governor has 

remained 
noncommittal, 
tell-

ing reporters at the U.S.-China 
Automotive Forum on Sunday 
he thought experience running 
a state would make for an ideal 
presidential candidate, but he 
declined to say whether or not he 
would consider running for the 
position.

“Right now I’m just trying to 

get around,” he said jokingly, in 
reference to a torn Achilles ten-
don. “I’m back to working on lit-
eral running first.”

Michigan’s first lady Sue Sny-

der has been less reserved. Dur-
ing the annual joint interview 
with her husband on Michigan 
Public TV, she said she would not 
want Snyder to run for president 
nor seek the vice presidency.

Snyder’s office did not return 

several requests for comment on 
the prospect of his 2016 candi-
dacy.

In regard to Snyder’s overall 

chance of attaining the presiden-
cy, Political Science Prof. Vincent 
Hutchings said the candidacy 

University 

researcher stresses 

importance of 

disease awareness 

By PARISHA NOVA

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
University-based 
data 

project has found patients with 
kidney disease are living longer 
than in the past.

The United States Renal 

Data System, whose coordi-
nating center is located in the 
School of Public Health Build-
ing, reported fewer cases of 
end-stage renal disease and 
fewer deaths related to it in the 
U.S. this year compared to last 
year in its annual data report.

As of 2012, there were 

636,905 people in the United 
States being treated for end-
stage renal disease, which 
worsens or eliminates the kid-
ney’s ability to function and 
support the body’s needs. The 
kidneys filter wastes and tox-
ins out of the body’s blood sup-
ply, making them an essential 

organ for supporting life.

Treatments for end-stage 

renal disease include dialysis — 
a method through which blood 
is purified clinically, or kidney 
transplant.

Rajiv Saran, a professor 

of internal medicine and the 
associate director of the Uni-
versity’s Kidney Epidemiology 
and Cost Center, said the report 
shows a declining trend in the 
growth rate of new cases of the 
disease.

“The USRDS registers and 

tracks every patient diagnosed 
with end-stage renal disease,” 
Saran said. “For the last three 
years, the rate of appearance of 
patients reaching end-stage has 
decreased.”

Saran said the data indicates 

an improvement in U.S. health 
care. After the age of 30 to 35, 
the body’s organ functions start 
declining. Low kidney func-
tion coupled with risk factors 
such as diabetes, hypertension 
and obesity makes the body 
more prone to end-stage renal 
disease. Fewer cases of this 
disease indicate an increased 
focus on addressing risk factors

WWII depletes graduate schools

Art docent, gives a tour as part of a program focused 
on engagement with art.

TALKING HE ADS

At the conference of the Asso-

ciation of American Colleges in 
Cleveland, university represen-
tatives from around the coun-
try discussed problems finding 
suitable teaching staffs, which 
had proved challenging with 
increasing enrollment.

University 
representative 

Hayward Keniston, at the time 
the LSA dean, said World War II 
had reduced the ability of grad-
uate students to teach.

“Because of wartime deple-

tion of graduate schools, there 
is no backlog of graduate stu-
dents who would be eligible 
as instructors,” he said. The 
conference recommended the 
establishment of an agency 
to advise veterans of existing 

vacancies in universities across 
the country.

49 years ago this week 

(Jan. 13, 1966)

The Ann Arbor City Council 

passed its first significant leg-
islation 
concerning 
high-rise 

buildings. This vote came after 
the construction of 
University Towers 
and more than a 
year of discussion.

The code did not 

include a height 
limitation 
on 

high-rises, but set 
standards includ-
ing floor area, lot 
size and the dis-

tance walls must sit back from 
the street. At the time, the code 
applied to the area west of State 
Street and between Kingsley 
Street and Madison Street.

Charlie Hebdo newspaper staff, with editorialist Patrick Pelloux, right, cartoonist Renald Luzier, known as Luz, left, react 
during a march in Paris, France, Sunday, Jan. 11. 
Millions protest in France 
following terrorist attacks

Rally is described 
as the largest in 
French history

PARIS (AP) — More than a 

million people surged through 
the boulevards of Paris behind 
dozens of world leaders walking 
arm-in-arm Sunday in a rally for 
unity described as the largest 
demonstration in French history. 
Millions more marched around 
the country and the world to 
repudiate three days of terror 
that killed 17 people and changed 
France.

Amid intense security and 

with throngs rivaling those that 
followed the liberation of Paris 
from the Nazis, the city became 
“the capital of the world” for a 
day, on a planet increasingly vul-
nerable to such cruelty.

More than 40 world leaders 

headed the somber procession — 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian Pres-
ident Mahmoud Abbas; Ukrai-
nian President Petro Poroshenko 
and Russian Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov — setting aside 
their differences with a common 
rallying cry: We stand together 

against barbarity, and we are all 
Charlie.

At least 1.2 million to 1.6 mil-

lion people streamed slowly 
through the streets behind them 
and across France to mourn the 
victims of deadly attacks on 
the satirical newspaper Charlie 
Hebdo, a kosher supermarket 
and police officers — violence 
that tore deep into the nation’s 
sense of security in a way some 
compared to Sept. 11 in the Unit-
ed States.

“Our entire country will rise 

up toward something better,” 
Hollande said.

Details of the attacks contin-

ued to emerge, with new video 
showing one of the gunmen 
pledging allegiance to the Islam-
ic State group and detailing how 
the attacks were going to unfold. 
That gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, 
was also linked to a new shoot-
ing, two days after he and the 
brothers behind the Charlie 
Hebdo massacre were killed in 
nearly simultaneous police raids.

The attacks tested France’s 

proud commitment to its liber-
ties, which authorities may now 
curtail to ensure greater secu-
rity. Marchers recognized this as 
a watershed moment.

“It’s a different world today,” 

said Michel Thiebault, 70.

Illustrating his point, there 

were cheers Sunday for police 
vans that wove through the 
crowds — a rare sight at the many 
demonstrations that the French 
have staged throughout their 
rebellious history, when protest-
ers and police are often at odds.

Many shed the aloof attitude 

Parisians are famous for, helping 
strangers with directions, cheer-
ing and crying together. Sad and 
angry but fiercely defending 
their freedom of expression, the 
marchers honored the dead and 
brandished pens or flags of other 
nations.

Giant 
rallies 
were 
held 

throughout France and major 
cities around the world, includ-
ing London, Madrid and New 
York — all attacked by al-Qaida-
linked extremists — as well as 
Cairo, Sydney, Stockholm, Tokyo 
and elsewhere.

In Paris, the Interior Minis-

try said “the size of this unprec-
edented demonstration makes it 
impossible to provide a specific 
count,” noting that the crowds 
were too big to fit on the official 
march route and spread to other 
streets.

Shooting leaves 

three dead and one 
critically wounded

(AP) — Investigators found 

five guns and a laptop computer 
in the vehicle of a man suspect-
ed of killing three people in a 
shooting spree, a police chief 
said Sunday, but they hadn’t yet 
uncovered any motive for the 
rampage.

John Lee, 29, was arrested 

following a high-speed chase in 
nearby Washington state after 
the shootings Saturday. Police 
believe he opened fire at three 
locations in the western Idaho 
city of Moscow, killing his land-
lord, his adoptive mother and a 
manager at a restaurant his par-
ents frequented. A Seattle man 
was also critically injured.

Investigators searched Lee’s 

car and apartment late Satur-
day night, Moscow Police Chief 

David Duke said. They found 
two semi-automatic pistols, a 
revolver, a shotgun and a rifle 
in the vehicle, along with a lap-
top, he said. Ballistics tests were 
expected 
to 
help 
determine 

which weapons might have been 
used in the shootings.

Authorities were seeking a 

warrant to search the computer, 
he said.

“There’s still nothing to iden-

tify a specific motive as to why 
Mr. Lee took these actions,” 
Duke said.

The first death was that of Lee’s 

adoptive mother, Terri Grzebiel-
ski, 61, at her home. Police said 
Lee then headed to Northwest 
Mutual life insurance, where he 
shot his landlord, David Trail, 
76, who was a local businessman 
and the brother of a former state 
representative, as well as Michael 
Chin, 39, of Seattle.

Duke said Chin had no link to 

Lee, but he was discussing busi-
ness with Trail when the gun-

man arrived. Duke said Chin was 
shot in the arm and leg. Authori-
ties initially said he was being 
flown to a hospital in Seattle in 
critical condition, but Duke said 
Sunday he was flown to one in 
Spokane. It wasn’t immediately 
clear which hospital he was in; a 
supervisor at Providence Sacred 
Heart Medical Center said Sun-
day the hospital would not con-
firm whether he was a patient 
there.

There were “some issues” 

regarding Lee’s apartment, Duke 
said, but no eviction proceedings 
that police were aware of.

Upon leaving the insurance 

office, the shooter drove to an 
Arby’s restaurant and asked 
for the manager. When she 
appeared, he pulled out a gun 
and opened fire. The manager, 
Belinda Niebuhr, 47, died at the 
Moscow hospital.

Duke told The Associated 

Press that Lee’s parents ate at 
the restaurant and knew the 
manager well, but it’s not clear 
whether Lee did as well. He did 
not work at the restaurant as far 
as police knew, and workers who 
witnessed the attack didn’t rec-
ognize him, Duke said.

Kelsey Stemrich said she was 

working at a cafe near Arby’s 
when she and a customer heard 
three gunshots and then saw 
people running from the restau-
rant. She says they took down 
the license-plate number of a 
car seen pulling away from the 
Arby’s and called it into police.

Police in Washington spot-

ted the suspect’s black Honda, 
and a chase involving multiple 
agencies ensued. Pullman Police 
Chief Gary Jenkins said the pur-
suit lasted nearly 25 miles, and 
Lee’s vehicle at times topped 100 
mph before crashing off High-
way 195 north of Colfax and roll-
ing to a stop.

Few details were available on 

Lee’s background. Duke said he 
had been adopted at birth, and 
he recently returned to Moscow 
after living for a few years in the 
Midwest.

Harper identified several promi-
nent University issues.

Last 
February, 
the 
U.S. 

Department of Education Office 
for Civil Rights announced they 
would investigate the University 
for its handling of allegations 
of sexual misconduct. In Jan. 
2014, The Michigan Daily first 
reported former kicker Brendan 
Gibbons’ permanent separation 
from the University for violating 
the Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy, which drew wide criti-
cism of the University’s response 
policy to sexual assault on cam-
pus.

Last year, the student-led 

#BBUM 
movement 
attracted 

widespread attention on Twit-
ter. Through tweets, students 
discussed challenges faced by 
Black students at the University. 
As part of the campaign, mem-
bers of the Black Student Union 
and the administration have dis-
cussed changes to the Trotter 
Multicultural Center as one way 
to improve minority experiences 
on campus.

“What I think about a lot is 

sexual assault on campuses, 
diversity and inclusion,” Harper 
wrote. “The steady but too low 
numbers of students of color. 
Also issues of high risk drink-
ing.”

Harper also wrote that her 

undergraduate education at the 

University and desire to share 
her own experience led her to 
her current position.

“I did my undergrad work 

here,” Harper wrote. “It was 
everything I needed, plus stuff 
I didn’t know I needed. I have 
a passion and love for young 
people & want them to have that 
kind of experience, so they can 
change the world.”

However, Harper also wrote 

that her job is not without chal-
lenges, 
such 
as 
considering 

the needs of multiple parties, 
especially if they are in conflict 
with one another. She noted 
the necessity finding a balance 
between transparency and rights 
to privacy, as well as individual 
freedoms and the interests of the 
community at large.

According to Harper, the bal-

ancing act is why problems in 
student life take a long time to 
get fixed, even if the administra-
tion places a priority on finding a 
solution for the problem.

“Big myth: If I care, a problem 

would be fixed NOW,” Harper 
wrote. “Many problems are more 
complicated & involve many 
people.”

Harper described a day at the 

Student Life office as a consis-
tent exercise in prioritizing and 
stressed the importance of keep-
ing the work moving.

“Every day is balancing the 

important with the urgent,” 
Harper wrote. “We have to be 
proactive in keeping important 
work moving. It doesn’t matter 

what the schedule is.”

Finally, Harper also listed 

several ways the students can get 
involved and have a voice at the 
University, such as volunteer-
ing at the Ginsberg Center and 
attending events through the 
Center for Campus Involvement.

In an e-mail to the Daily, 

LSA senior Katie Szymanski, a 
UMSocial Media intern, wrote 
that the staff of UMSocial, 
which handles the University’s 
social media accounts, usually 
does not participate through 
their personal accounts to let the 
community participate instead. 
However, Szymanski said she 
felt inclined to tweet a question 
during Friday’s chat.

“I felt like this topic regarding 

student life and campus com-
munity really spoke to what I’m 
going through as a senior at the 
University of Michigan,” Szy-
manski wrote. “At one point, 
I joked about being indecisive 
about graduate school and looked 
at Royster for her response. She 
responded with ‘Tweet it at me!’ 
It almost felt like I was talking 
with one of my own friends.”

The next #UMichChat will 

take place in February, with 
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder 
and Thomas Zurbuchen, pro-
fessor of space science and 
aerospace engineering and the 
associate dean for entrepre-
neurship. The topic will focus 
on innovation, entrepreneur-
ship and the state of Michigan’s 
future.

might not be realistic.

“This is not a reflection on 

Snyder, but it takes a lot of money 
to make a viable run for the 
White House,” he said.

Hutchings also noted that 

several 
high-profile 
Republi-

cans such as Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, 
Rand Paul and possibly Marco 
Rubio have already established 
themselves as candidates in the 
race and locked up key donors. 
The 2012 Republican candidate 
Mitt Romney also stated his 
intention to run to a group of 
donors last week.

He said he felt it was already 

too late for Snyder to launch a 
successful campaign, and since 
Snyder has not been actively 
seeking donors, he most likely 
will not run.

Nonetheless, as the country 

gears up for the 2016 race, sev-
eral aspects of the governor’s 
record have received prominent 
attention. Snyder won reelection 
in 2014, carrying 51 percent of 
the vote in what was expected 
to be a close race against his 
Democratic counterpart Mark 
Schauer.

As 
governor, 
Snyder 
also 

passed a right-to-work bill that 
allows employees to retain their 
jobs without needing to join a 
union, a policy few other GOP 
governors have been able to 
accomplish.

However, since Republicans 

in Congress have attempted to 
dismantle portions of the health 
care reform laws passed under 
the Obama administration, Sny-
der’s policy record could also 
become a source of scrutiny.

Richard Hirth, professor of 

health management and policy at 
the University, said Snyder might 
face opposition in a Republican 
primary based on his admin-
istration’s 
Healthy 
Michigan 

Plan. The plan, which expanded 
Michigan’s Medicaid program, 
has been touted as an early suc-
cess, enrolling over 400,000 
low-income Michiganders since 
April, but also places Snyder in 
contrast to the prevailing GOP 
standpoint on highly contested 
federal healthcare legislation 
such as the Affordable Care Act.

“Since he was so instrumental 

in the Healthy Michigan plan, it 
will be hard for him to run com-
pletely away from it,” Hirth said. 
“He can still oppose the (federal) 
health care law broadly as a mat-

ter of principle to appeal to vot-
ers who oppose the law.”

After Romney lost the 2012 

presidential election, Hirth said 
the GOP would be less likely 
to support a candidate such as 
Snyder, who has arguably taken 
a more moderate approach to 
health care reform. As governor 
of Massachusetts, Romney pio-
neered a plan with similar facets 
as the ACA.

However, if Snyder made it to 

a general election, Hirth said he 
may be able to win some level of 
bipartisan support.

When the Healthy Michigan 

Plan passed in December 2013, 
Snyder requested federal waivers 
that allowed the state to receive 
federal funding for the plan while 
avoiding 
adoption 
of 
certain 

requirements under the ACA. 
However, Hirth was skeptical 
Republicans would accept a candi-
date who took the middle-ground 
approach to health reform.

“I don’t think I’d want to be 

him making that argument in 
most Republican primaries,” he 
said. “If he somehow got through 
the primaries, I think he could 
play that as a responsible, mid-
dle-ground approach.”

SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich.
Parked pick-up 
truck explodes

Authorities say they are inves-

tigating an explosion in a pickup 
truck parked in the driveway of a 
home near Detroit.

Oakland County sheriff’s depu-

ties say nobody was in the vehicle 
at the time of the Saturday morn-
ing explosion. The blast signifi-
cantly damaged the truck and 
sent debris across the Springfield 
Township home’s yard and drive-
way. 

The explosion also shattered a 

window on the home but nobody 
inside was hurt.

Deputies are working with 

state and federal law enforcement 
officials to determine the cause or 
motive of the blast.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 
Court case could 
foil government 
suits over job bias

The Supreme Court could put 

the brakes on the Obama admin-
istration’s 
growing 
crackdown 

against companies facing claims 
of discrimination against women, 
minorities and other protected 
groups.

Justices will hear arguments 

Tuesday in a case that considers 
whether employers can defend dis-
crimination lawsuits by asserting 
that government lawyers did not 
try hard enough to settle claims 
before going to court.

Companies 
are 
complain-

ing increasingly about the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Com-
mission’s 
“systemic 
litigation” 

program, which turns individual 
complaints of bias into high-stakes 
class-action cases on behalf of doz-
ens or even hundreds of workers.

The enforcement strategy has 

netted over $100 million in legal 
judgments and settlements from 
more than 50 companies since 
2011, including $20 million from 
Verizon Inc. to settle allegations 
that the company unfairly fired or 
disciplined hundreds of disabled 
workers for missing work.

PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia
AirAsia black boxes 
may be recovered

While Indonesia’s navy said 

divers had not yet found the black 
boxes from the AirAsia plane that 
crashed into the Java Sea two 
weeks ago, searchers on Sunday 
honed in on intense pings detect-
ed amid a growing belief that the 
devices will soon be recovered.

“The two are close to each other, 

just about 20 meters (yards),” 
Soesilo told reporters. “Hopefully, 
they are the cockpit voice recorder 
and flight data recorder.”

Officials said earlier Sunday 

that two separate pings had been 
detected.

Tonny Budiono, team coor-

dinator at the Directorate of 
Sea Transportation, said in a 
statement that the signals were 
intense in one area, and that the 
recorders were believed to be 
lodged there beneath wreckage. 
If divers are unable to free it, all 
of the debris will be lifted, the 
statement said.

for the disease.

Though 14 percent of U.S. 

adults suffer from chronic kidney 
disease, which can eventually lead 
to end-stage renal failure, Saran 
said awareness of the condition 
is low in comparison to illnesses 
such as diabetes or heart disease.

“We need more awareness; we 

need people to practice primary 
and secondary prevention,” he 
said. “Less than 20 percent of 
those diagnosed with the dis-
ease are aware of their low kid-
ney functions.”

To prevent the chronic con-

dition, Saran also noted the 
importance of monitoring kid-
ney function patients coming 
in and out of the University of 
Michigan Health System. Pri-

mary prevention, which involves 
screening for risk factors, is the 
first step toward overcoming 
this challenge and accelerating 
the decline in the incidence of 
the disease.

“Non-communicable diseases 

such as these need early atten-
tion,” Saran said. “We need to 
take action sooner.”

Saran said transplants and 

dialysis have helped keep peo-
ple with chronic kidney disease 
alive longer, which is why fewer 
people are reaching end-stage 
renal disease. Even so, the pool 
of patients diagnosed with the 
chronic disease is not declining. 
In Ann Arbor, dialysis units have 
been cropping up increasingly in 
the last three years.

“The pool of sick people still 

continues to increase,” Saran said. 
“A chronic disease does not go 
away.”

Abbott, an adjunct professor of 
chemistry and biology at the Uni-
versity of Lethbridge in Canada 
and research scientist at Agri-
culture and Agri-Food Canada; 
and Harry Gilbert, biochemistry 
professor at Newcastle Univer-
sity in the United Kingdom, col-
laborated on the study.

With studies currently under-

way, the researchers hope the 
Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron 

bacterium can be developed into 
a therapeutic for people with 
diseases such as Crohn’s.

Abbott said distinguishing the 

bacteria’s relationship with sugar 
compared to yeast was an impor-
tant step in moving forward.

“On the surface of the human 

intestines, there are sugars that 
are very similar in structure to 
what you find on yeast, but there 
are dedicated pathways in this 
bacteria for digesting human 
sugars and for digesting yeast 
sugars,” he said. “(This) suggests 
that the relationship that bacte-
ria has with the human host is 
very different from the relation-
ship it has with yeast.”

In their study, the research-

ers tested their findings on 
mice, whose digestive tracts are 
similar to those of humans. To 
do so, they fed the mice Zinger-
man’s bread; the company pro-
vided 50-percent yeast-leavened 

breadcrumbs as food samples for 
the mice.

“Mice don’t have any androg-

ynous bacteria already in their 
gut so we can put what we want 
and … the quantity and genetic 
composition that we want,” 
Martens said. “So instead of put-
ting one human bacteria on top 
of hundreds of species of mouse 
bacteria already there, there’s 
nothing there. We know exactly 
what the physiology of the sys-
tem is.”

Gilbert and Martens teamed 

up after attending a conference 
together in 2009, where Gil-
bert became interested in one of 
Martens’s previously published 
papers on fungal cell molecules 
and intestinal cell walls.

“It really kind of started as a 

light discussion over a beer or 
two at conference and a few sim-
ple experiments and those few 
simple experiments turned out 
to be really interesting,” Mar-
tens said. “A lot more detailed 
studies came after that.”

Martens and Abbott said they 

were pleased with the study’s 
results.

“Everyone 
who 
becomes 

a researcher, you know, your 
whole career or your mission 
is to do something that actu-
ally makes a difference so if, in 
some small way, this study can 
lead to a therapy for people suf-
fering from intestinal diseases, 
that would be very rewarding,” 
Abbott said.

appointment.

“Somebody of this caliber, we 

could’ve only wished for. It’s like 
Christmas – we got it!” Brow 
said.

Both Collins and his col-

leagues said they look forward 
to changes and improvements in 
store for the department.

“For years we’ve needed this 

type of leadership to make suc-
cession plans, and I think that 
he’s going to be able to get us 
going in the right direction,” 
Brow said.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Collins said he 
wants to involve members of the 
community in the process.

“I’ve got to get in and get my 

feet on the ground,” he said. 

“I’ve got to get a better under-
standing of the community, the 
department and its needs.”

“I think at that point in time 

what we do is we sit down and 
(compose) a strategic and a 
master plan to guide us into 
the future based upon changes 
in demand, based upon fiscal 
resources, based upon training 
needs and those kinds of things 
… We want that to be an open 
process.”

At the ceremony and recep-

tion, Collins said he considers 
Ann Arbor to be a world-class 
city, adding that the AAFD could 
become a world-class depart-
ment to match it. He said he feels 
privileged to lead the organiza-
tion, though he still maintains 
ties to Ohio, where he served at 
the Dayton Fire Department for 
thirty years.

“And remember: go Bucks,” he 

said.

P

resumably (depending on 
one’s year of graduation) 
we 
have 

been graded for 
the past 15 years 
of 
our 
lives. 

Whether it’s an S for Satisfactory, 
a 4.0 for perfection or a B+ for you 
almost made it, most students have 
had an arbitrary numbering system 
attached to their name for as long 
as they can remember.

Upon my recent conclusion of 

undergraduate courses, I am unde-
niably reflecting on my time as a 
student. An adviser asked me the 
other day how it feels to be done. I 
said it felt good, but I wasn’t exactly 
sure why … I love learning, I love 
the University, I love my profes-
sors, my peers, Ann Arbor, etc. So 
again, why does it feel so good “to 
be done”? I thought for a moment 
and said, “It is liberating to not be 
graded for my work for, what feels 
like, the first time in my life.”

We are innately social creatures, 

we attempt to be well-rounded, 
and we strive for excellence, to be 
healthy and physically fit and to 
maintain close relationships with 
others, while also miraculously 
obtaining a 4.0. If the pursuits that 
I listed above are truly the essence 
of life, then this 4.0 pressure is 
not feasible and only marginal-
izes what one considers important 
about our existence.

Mentors often tell us grades 

cannot possibly calculate one’s 
improvement or a student’s knowl-
edge — yet their existence persists, 
and not only that, but grades con-
tinue to be a predominant factor 
in being admitted to most forms 
of collegiate education. If grades 
supposedly 
“don’t 
matter 
that 

much,” then why is it still the form 
in which we are reviewed? No one 
wants to be the student who craves 
the A- instead of the B+ or the B 
instead of the C, but we are living 
in a culture that grooms students 
to be grade grubbers. Professors 
similarly dislike this neediness for 
higher grades and often choose to 
stick to a bell curve. If grades don’t 
truly matter, then why not give 
the student an A or just a big P for 
pass? Perhaps it’s because there is 
a similar pressure from public uni-
versities to not inflate grades or for 
professors to appear tough. What-
ever the reason, the pressure comes 
from all angles.

It is not my point to direct fingers 

at a particular branch of education, 
but rather to show the vicious cycle 
and the paradox in which students 
are trapped. Maybe it’s not the fault 
of the students, professors or even 
universities as a whole, but more-
over the symbol of what education 
has grown to mean and the ideas 
that it perpetuates that underlie the 
real problem.

Perhaps I am suggesting abolish-

ing standardized testing or a refor-

mation of our system of grading, but 
what really must occur is a change in 
the system of education as a whole. 
In Ken Robinson’s video, “Chang-
ing Education Paradigms,” the nar-
rator discusses how the foundation 
of education began in a time when 
women didn’t have rights and slav-
ery existed. It is ignorant to think 
that the ideologies and structures 
that were created back then should 
be maintained nearly 400 years 
later, when we have progressed way 
beyond these confines. Robinson 
states, “The problem is they are try-
ing to meet the future by doing what 
they did in the past.”

Yes, this argument has been pre-

sented before, but it’s still difficult to 
find the change. In order to create a 
learning community where we prac-
tice what we preach, a huge shift in 
the paradigm of education is hope-
fully on the rise. If nothing more, at 
least for the time being, it is helpful 
to recognize the paradox and pres-
sure students face. As much as one 
can, we can individually attempt to 
live outside of the paradox: learn 
in classes, work hard and hopefully 
the arbitrary letter will follow in the 
right direction. And, if not, remem-
ber that this grade is flat, it has no 
breath, no heartbeat, no laughter, no 
passion and in no way can reflect the 
complexity of a person.

A

fter the results of the midterm elec-
tions poured in — a curt realization 
for the Democratic Party that the 

American people were all 
but 
impressed 
with 
the 

Democrats in office — Presi-
dent Barack Obama said on 
CBS’s “Face the Nation” that, 
“Whenever, as the head of 
the party, it doesn’t do well, 
I’ve got to take responsibility 
for it.”

Responsibility is what he’s 

been taking — issuing veto 
threats to Congress, restor-
ing diplomatic relations with 
Cuba, exercising his executive action power 
on immigration issues and reminding count-
less Americans in both red and blue states 
that the American economy is steadily and 
 

surely improving.

Last Thursday, Obama delivered a speech 

at the Ford Motor manufacturing plant in 
Wayne, Michigan. Behind the podium, where 
Obama delivered remarks, sat American-made 
Ford automobiles — red, silver and blue. On 
the left side of the podium, an American flag 
hung, stretched flatly and tightly, as if straight-
ened by a military bed-maker’s hand. Amidst 
the atmosphere created by an American auto 
plant cloaked in patriotic garb, it all felt very 
working-class American. This wasn’t surpris-
ing given the rhetoric Obama has consistently 
delivered while in office, one during his address 
in Michigan.

Obama’s speech commenced a three-day-

long trip to Michigan, Arizona and Tennessee 
— states that voted Republican for governor in 
the recent midterm elections. Given the new 
GOP Senate majority, Obama’s red-state stops 
were strategic reminders of the White House’s 
exploits since 2008. The three states on the 
agenda all exemplify initiatives taken in the 
economic, housing and education spheres. And 
further, on Jan. 9 in Knoxville, Tennessee, 
Obama announced a colossal initiative on the 
education front — America’s College Promise — 
making “two years of community college free 
to responsible students who are willing to work 
for it.” This promise mimics the Tennessee 
Promise, a similar pact for Tennessee residents, 
making Tennessee the spearheading force for 
free higher education.

In Michigan two days prior, amidst pipes 

and car parts, Obama discussed the revival of 
the American auto industry. In 2008, as report-
ed by the White House, the automobile indus-
try was “on the brink of collapse.” The same 
report, published June 2011, states that in 2009, 
“the president’s decision to save GM and Chrys-
ler was about more than those two companies. 
It was about standing by the countless workers, 
communities, and businesses — large and small 
— that depend on the automotive industry.”

Although Ford — the most secure of the 

Detroit three — was not among the companies 
that received a federal bailout, by aiding GM 
and Chrysler, America avoided a “cascading 
impact throughout the supply chain, causing 
failures and job loss on a larger scale.” Because 
of Ford’s tie to the same auto suppliers as GM 
and Chrysler, Obama’s decision to provide a 
bailout can in large part account for Ford’s 
 

current profitability.

When speaking to the people, plant work-

ers and apprentices-turned-professionals of 
Wayne, Obama manifested a tendency blatant 
even in speeches given during his first presi-
dential campaign: a deep appreciation and con-

cern for the middle class. “If we all do our part, 
if we all pitch in, then we can make sure that 
this rising tide is actually lifting all the boats, 
not just some,” Obama said. “We can make sure 
that the middle class is the engine that powers 
America’s prosperity for decades to come.”

After a very rough six years in office, Obama 

has turned a corner, taking a proactive stance in 
addressing his administration’s achievements 
and proposing new initiatives that have put lib-
erals on the edge of their seats. This stance is 
demonstrative of the fearless attitude seen in a 
younger, more optimistic Barack Obama — one 
that sparked a national movement toward the 
alluring concept of change.

But disappointment has become a national 

sentiment over the past six years, with Wash-
ington in gridlock and the Obama admin-
istration only grazing over issues with a 
moderate tone. I believe the new Republican 
Senate majority was almost welcomed in by 
some liberals, assuming that Senate majority 
leader Mitch McConnell sticks to his word to 
 

pass legislation.

As an advocate and lover of all things Obama, 

I’ve found myself defending his presidency for 
no other reason than that I see him as a moral 
person, a family man and a leader. I’ve clung 
to words shouted during his 2008 acceptance 
speech: “I will never forget who this victory 
truly belongs to. It belongs to you.”

But along the six-year road, the path that 

has lodged too many national and international 
crises to count, it began to feel like maybe the 
American people weren’t as victorious as we 
had once hoped we’d be.

However, once Obama began to announce 

shocking and almost radical new initiatives, 
such as restoring diplomatic relations with 
Cuba, I, along with the rest of the country’s 
Obama enthusiasts, were reminded of his will-
ingness and determination to change the free 
world. Obama’s speech in Michigan planted 
subtle hints at the administration’s victo-
ries — the federal bailout of the auto indus-
try is a big one — but I believe his words went 
 

beyond that.

He asserted that “this state proves that no 

matter how tough times get, Americans are 
tougher.” And what I believe is embedded 
within that statement is that no matter how 
tough times get in America, the Obama admin-
istration is tougher. Toughness is what he’s 
demonstrating in response to the GOP Senate 
majority. Action is what he’s proposing for the 
last two years of his presidency. Consistency 
is what he’s preaching when he comments 
on the middle class and its importance to our 
 

great nation.

Obama’s rhetoric, now reformed to become 

fiercely operative, is at the forefront an oration 
delivered to members of the middle class. His 
new policies and intentions aren’t uber liberal, 
and they aren’t on the brink of socialist either. 
They’re intended to fuel economic, personal 
and professional growth among the majority 
of Americans. Twice during his speech at the 
Michigan Assembly Plant, Obama noted that 
no matter what, we should never become com-
placent. Complacency is the touch of death to 
progress. Americans are resilient, and Obama, 
an American, is resilient. Given his consistent 
concern for those who need help coupled with 
a new drive to enact change, I will leave with 
words that probably put a fire in your belly back 
in 2008: Yes we can.

More than a high-five

President Barack Obama stopped 

in Wayne, Michigan on Jan. 7 for 
his first speech in a three-day tour 
leading up to his State of the Union 
address. Held at a Ford Assembly 
plant, his speech highlighted the suc-
cess of his administration’s bailout of 
the auto industry in 2009. Michigan 
Republican Party Chairman Bobby 
Schostak, however, called the presi-
dent’s tour “another opportunity he’s 
taking to run all over the country and 
high-five himself.” Schostak contin-
ues to insist that the auto bailout was 
unnecessary, stating that there were 
 

“other options.”

Obama’s speech was more than 

just Obama high-fiving himself. It 
was ultimately a celebration of the 
middle class, the auto industry and 
Detroit. Obama did, however, high-
light the success of the auto bailout. 
The auto bailout used $80 billion 
of taxpayer money and, as Obama 
noted, as of last month “the auto 
companies have now repaid taxpay-
ers every dime and more of what 
(his) administration invested.” Being 
transparent about the use of taxpay-
er money was, in this case, inher-
ently self-congratulatory, but that 
doesn’t make it unnecessary. For a 
move that was so unpopular, it would 
be foolish not to point out its success. 
The president stuck his neck out 
for the auto industry, and showing 
America that he did the right thing is 
 

hardly deplorable.

The focus of the speech, however, 

was not the Obama administration. 
The emphasis quickly shifted back 
to the people who took the oppor-
tunity to save a newly revitalized 
auto industry that was given to them 
and ultimately made it successful. 
Obama made it clear that it was the 
workers he was addressing, and 
their counterparts at other plants 
throughout America, who made the 
bailout successful. To the workers, 
Obama declared, “because of you, 
manufacturing has a future in this 
country.” Repeatedly, he stressed 
that it was the autoworkers who 
saved America’s last bastion of man-
ufacturing. It was the people work-
ing in both management and labor 
throughout the auto industry who 
took the money from the bailout and 
turned the auto industry around, 
helping the economy to recover. Its 
success wouldn’t have been possible 
without the hard work and sacrifice 
of the autoworkers.

The fact that the speech was 

delivered at a Ford plant to Ford 
employees speaks to the necessity of 
the auto bailout. Ford never received 
funding from the bailout, so why 
would Obama go there to comment 
on its success? The bailout saved 
more than just General Motors and 
Chrysler. It saved an entire industry 
that would have fallen apart if GM 
and Chrysler had failed. Schostak 
used the fact that Ford was able to 
restructure on its own without gov-
ernment financing as proof that the 

bailout was unnecessary, but the 
Ford employees cheered for Obama 
when he spoke about the success of 
the bailout because they understand 
the basic economic structure of the 
auto industry better than Schostak. 
They know that Ford could not have 
simply restructured and become as 
successful as it is today if GM and 
Chrysler had failed. Should GM 
and Chrysler have failed, auto sup-
pliers could not have survived, and 
Ford would have suffered as a con-
sequence. The livelihoods of those 
employed by the Big Three and their 
suppliers depended on this bailout.

For Schostak to continue to 

deny the necessity and success of 
the auto bailout as the chairman 
of the Michigan Republican Party 
is pig-headed and misrepresents 
Republicans across Metro Detroit 
whose jobs were saved in the bail-
out. Furthermore, in his rush to be 
against anything and everything 
Obama-related, 
Schostak 
prema-

turely wrote off Obama’s speech as 
a mere self-congratulations, when 
it ended up being more about the 
triumphs of the auto industry, the 
middle class, Detroit and Michigan. 
After all, I think few Michiganders 
would disagree with Obama when 
he said, “this state proves no mat-
ter how tough times get, Americans 
 

are tougher.”

versity President Mark Schlissel in an article 
published January 6. As someone who has 
been impressed with Schlissel, I felt com-
pelled to respond. The strange assertions 
began early in the piece, when Manes wrote, 
“Based on his background in higher educa-
tion, his visible identities and his expressed 
intent in taking the most highly esteemed 
position at this university, I didn’t see what 
he could bring to a campus such as ours.” 
What does this even mean? His background 
in higher education (professor at Johns Hop-
kins, dean at University of California, Berke-
ley, provost at Brown) left him unqualified 
to be Michigan president? Would Manes 
have preferred a politician? His “expressed 
intent” to take the job? Did we want some-
one who accidentally took the job? Any fair-
minded observer has to conclude Schlissel’s 
experience makes him eminently qualified to 
lead the University, so Manes’ initial doubts 
are confusing and unfortunately not made 
explicit enough to take seriously.

Manes 
criticizes 
Schlissel’s 
handling 

of sexual assault because he objected to a 

framing of requests by an anonymous group 
of students as “demands,” which, he said, 
“makes it really difficult to have discussions.” 
Schlissel’s comment “dismisses and silences 
students’ feelings and experiences,” Manes 
wrote. “While Schlissel didn’t have to agree 
with any of the demands, he needed to affirm 
the feelings of those who wrote them, not 
mock his students.” I’d agree — if that was 
all he had to say on the topic. Had the author 
bothered to watch Schlissel’s interview in 
which he made those comments, posted on 
the Daily’s website, she would have also 
heard him say, “I’m impressed by people that 
develop this passion … to take the time and 
show up in public and talk about something 
they care about a lot. The kinds of things that 
the students who were discussing their feel-
ings about sexual assault and the way the 
University handles this were all reasonable 
things to think about and discuss.” The Uni-
versity needs the help of the student body to 
fix its poor approach to sexual assault; Schlis-
sel is welcoming a discussion on this issue 
much more openly than his predecessor’s 
administration did.

that, in meetings with students, 
“not once (has he), or anyone on 
his behalf, (taken) a single note on 
the ‘student feedback and input’ 
that was requested.” “Inexcusable,” 
she writes. Really? Given Schlis-
sel was able to recall several of the 
previously 
referenced 
demands 

specifically (seriously, watch the 
interview, he knew them all off 
the top of his head), we know he is 
absorbing what students tell him. 
And the lack of note-taking would 
be a small-time offense by Schlis-
sel — if it were true. As one recent 
fireside chat attendee told me, 
“he wrote his notes on the back of 
his name tag to ensure he would 
remember what a student said to 
him.” Additionally, I am told there 
is normally someone taking notes 
on a computer for him during fire-
side chats and other meetings with 
groups of students.

Schlissel’s engagement with stu-

dents in his first six months has 
been impressive. The first meeting 
he held on the day he was intro-
duced as president-elect was with 
students (at his request). He has 
held open and frank fireside chats 
with students and meetings with 
student groups at a greater fre-
quency than his predecessor. He 
has been visible in the student 
community, even inviting students 
over to his house for Thanksgiving 
dinner. He responded profession-
ally but quickly to the scandal and 
student outrage brewing over the 
mismanagement of Michigan Ath-
letics. Schlissel installed an interim 
Athletic Director who has already 
taken great steps to reform the cul-
ture of the Athletic Department. 
Schlissel is working with students 
on new efforts to promote diversity 
and sustainability on campus.

Six months is not nearly enough 

time to judge Schlissel’s tenure as 
President, and he is bound to hit a 
few speed bumps as he acquaints 
himself with the University. But 
his leadership has, so far, been a 
breath of fresh air for the Universi-
ty. I hope students continue to raise 
issues to Schlissel (hopefully more 
serious issues than “take notes”) 
and that he continues to engage 
with students. If he is the president 
I think he is, the student voice at the 
University will enjoy a bigger seat 
at the table than it has in a while. 
And Schlissel could become one of 
the most transformative presidents 
in our University’s history because 
of it.

Franchise falls 
apart in ‘Taken 3’ 

Neeson’s screen 

presence can’t save 
messy blockbuster

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

Not even Liam Neeson could 

save this one.

Though 
the 
62-year-old 

action star manages to main-
tain his always 
impressive 
screen 
pres-

ence, 
his 

talents 
are 

wasted on this 
most 
lacklus-

ter, incoherent 
and 
ill-con-

ceived 
action 

vehicle from French director 
Olivier 
Megaton 
(“Colombi-

ana”). Indeed, it’s time to lay 
this “Taken” franchise to rest.

A sequel to the previous two 

“Taken” films in name only, 
this third go for retired covert 
operative Bryan Mills features 
no kidnappings or Albanians 
from Tropoja. Instead, Mills is 
framed for the murder of his ex-
wife (Famke Janssen, “X-Men”) 
and must embark on a mission 
to clear his name while doling 
out occasional mild-mannered, 
PG-13 punishment to those 
responsible.

In theory, this idea is intrigu-

ing — an update of “The Fugi-
tive” with Neeson replacing the 
equally formidable Harrison 
Ford in the title role. Sadly, the 
premise proves the only com-
parison between the two films. 
Where “The Fugitive” is clever, 
gripping and intelligent, “Taken 
3” proves humdrum, a mere 
exercise in emptying wallets.

The script, from French mae-

stro Luc Besson (“Lucy”) and 
American Robert Mark Kamen 
(“The Fifth Element”), is so 
contrived, so very ignorant of 
just how stupid it is. And Mega-
ton’s direction features, quite 
simply, some of the choppiest, 
most incomprehensible cam-

erawork and editing, as well 
as a dearth of poignancy and 
immediacy. One chase sequence 
— and there are multiple, each 
less compelling than the previ-
ous — features, and I’m not even 
kidding, four cuts in about one 
second. That’s about equivalent 
to twisting your head side-to-
side as fast as you can in one 
second — it’s dizzying. Throw 
in some shaky camera work, 
and you have yourself an unin-
telligible film.

The actors are given little to 

work with; Liam Neeson (“Non-
Stop”) is solid as always, though 
he has far less to do here than 
one would hope (but he does 
survive two, count ‘em, two 
car explosions). Newcomer to 
the franchise Forest Whitaker 
(“Out of the Furnace”) plays 
the cop assigned to take Mills 
down. I assume he was added 
to create a sense of urgency, 
but, really, what kind of threat 
does the LAPD pose to a guy 
who singlehandedly took out 
an entire human trafficking 
cartel? Maggie Grace (“Knight 
and Day”) returns as Mills’s 
daughter to look sad and help-
less. And Stuart, the new hus-
band of Mills’s ex-wife from 
the first “Taken,” miraculously 
reverse-aged 10 years and was 
recast as Dougray Scott (“Mis-
sion Impossible 2”).

I’ll admit, I have a soft spot 

for these kinds of action films 
— yes they’re mindless, yes 
they don’t advance cinema in 
any way, shape or form and yes, 
they’re fun as hell. Not every-
thing that we deem cinema 
needs to be high art, not every-
thing needs to be avant-garde, 
cerebral, meaningful. Some-
times a healthy dose of escap-
ism is not only welcome but also 
necessary. But it’s mishandled 
films like “Taken 3” that prove 
me wrong.

I’ve gotten a lot of flak for 

wanting to see this film, and in 
this instance I was rightfully 
put in my place. The action film 
as a genre has been thoroughly 
stripped down into a series of 
explosions, quick cuts, shaky 
camerawork and poorly devel-
oped characters. There is, or 
used to be, artistry to convinc-
ing an audience that they are 
watching 
something 
urgent, 

that there is danger and that 
they should care about the man 
or woman facing that danger. 
What we have now is a mere 
semblance of action’s former 
self, a genre that seemed origi-
nal not ten years ago reduced to 
a skeleton, a formula.

So for now, I’ll look to the past 

for my adrenaline fix, for my 
danger. And to all those would-
be warriors out there, looking 
to revive a lost art, I have but 
two words for you: Good luck.

‘Galavant’ is 
fun, not funny

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

The musical TV genre has a very 

mixed track record on network tele-
vision. While “Glee” was successful 
for a long time 
and 
“Empire” 

opened strongly 
this week, other 
attempts 
(like 

“Smash”) 
have 

failed. 
While 

the ratings for 
“Galavant” 
were 
nothing 

to write home 
about, this show 
should have gained more atten-
tion. Though it’s not perfect, the 
first two episodes produce a highly 
entertaining hour of television, 
putting it among the better televi-
sion musicals.

“Galavant” follows an epony-

mous 
knight 
(Joshua 
Sasse, 

“Rogue”) whose true love Madale-
na (Mallory Jensen, “Young & 
Hungry”) 
was 
kidnapped 
by 

the evil King Richard (Timothy 
Omundson, “Psych”) so he could 
marry her. When Gal interrupts 
their wedding, Madalena chooses 
to remain with the king. After a 
year of heartache, the Princess of 
Valencia (Karen David, “Waterloo 
Road”) asks for his help in a quest to 
save her kingdom from the clutches 
of King Richard.

What contributes the most to 

“Galavant” ’s fun tone is its music. 
Written by Alan Menken and Glenn 
Slater (collaborators on Broadway’s 
“The Little Mermaid”), the songs 
are catchy and cathartic. The core 
of the show lies in its ability to 
release beautiful songs in each epi-
sode. Numbers like King Richard’s 

“She’ll be Mine” or the quartet 
songs “Maybe You’re Not the Worst 
Person Ever” prove that Men-
ken and Slater know how to put 
together amusing tunes with some 
clever words. Though the main 
“Galavant” melody does begin to 
tire by the third reprise in the hour, 
Slater adds some sharp quips to the 
lyrics which lessen the burnout.

While the songs’ humorous lyr-

ics are fantastic, the show’s dialogue 
is disappointing. Some contain 
humorous moments, but many have 
gags that come off as overly broad. 
Sometimes they have a solid idea, 
but it lasts for one or two lines too 
long, like a scene where Gal’s rival 
Sir Jean Hamm (John Stamos, “Full 
House”) tells a series of “yo-mama” 
jokes. Creator Dan Fogleman was 
also responsible for “The Neigh-
bors,” which was similarly hit-
and-miss comedically. It’s a shame 
that these scenes aren’t as strong, 
because they’re the only things that 
hold this show back from being the 
best small-screen musical.

The lack of comedic success is not 

the cast’s fault, however. Many of 
the actors bring charm to the screen 
despite being saddled with weak 
material. Omundson especially gets 
some of the more immature jests, 
but he has so much fun with his 
part that you hardly notice the bad 
jokes. He gives a huge performance, 
chewing scenery left and right. It 
works well, especially in the musical 
numbers. He is what makes “She’ll 
be Mine” as amusing as it is.

“Galavant” is exactly what a 

TV musical should be. Its songs 
are catchy and it’s a hell of a good 
time. While the humor isn’t 
always strong, the other elements 
are prominent enough to make it 
incredibly enjoyable television.

Earning the right to 
wear band T-shirts

DGC RECORDS

Smells like teen spirit...or maybe that’s manure.

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

They’re everywhere.
Who would’ve thought two 

little x’s for eyes, a squiggly smi-
ley face to finish them off and an 
all-caps rendering of a band name 
would unite and inadvertently 
become the biggest fashion state-
ment of 2014?

Sure, the typically black and yel-

low T-shirts containing the afore-
mentioned components emerged 
way before this past year — 1987, 
to be exact, when Nirvana formed. 
But it wasn’t until last year (pos-
sibly before, one is too trauma-
tized by it all to look these things 
up) that Urban Outfitters and 
other hipster-catering clothing 
brands decided Kurt Cobain, Krist 
Novoselic and Dave Grohl were 
the new Louis Vuitton bag.

As preposterous as it sounds to 

the ears of any ex-brooding teen or 
early ’90s connoisseur, grunge is 
“in” now, dipped in flannel shirts, 
Dr. Martens and Nirvana; 1994 has 
come full circle (except, of course, 
in regards to popular music). Teen-
age girls, fashion bloggers and hip 
men alike don Nirvana t-shirts. 
Got a lone black blazer? Finish it 
off with some distressed jeans, 
black booties and a Nirvana t-shirt. 
It’s a neutral; it goes with every-

thing. Don’t worry.

All this leaves music purists and 

Nirvana fans with one pesky ques-
tion: Do these people even know 
who Nirvana is?

Now, maybe we’re not giving 

them enough credit. I’m sure they 
know Nirvana was a band with a 
lead singer that died. Oh, and they 
sang that one really catchy song, 
“Smells Like Teen Spirit,” right? 
Yeah, that was a good one. Really 
edgy, man. That one was rockin’.

But do they know some of Nir-

vana’s best work (i.e. “Dive” or 
“Aneurysm”) wasn’t a product of 
Nevermind, however glorious it is, 
but rather 1992’s Incesticide? Do 
they know about “In Bloom” or the 
Biblical imagery of “Heart-Shaped 
Box”? Do they know Cobain wrote 
“Something in the Way” about his 
experiences with homelessness, 
allegedly living under the bridge 
on Wishkah River in Washington 
when he couldn’t find a place to 
sleep (though Novoselic disputes 
this)? Moreover, do they intensely 
dislike Courtney Love?

Probably not. Well, maybe the 

Courtney Love part.

I like to think this parapher-

nalia constitutes a “true” fan, one 
that is worthy, for lack of a better 
word, of wearing a shirt with a 
certain band’s name. I personally 
employ a strict 15-song rule before 

I slip any sort of music-related 
attire on my body: If I know at 
least 15 songs by the artist on the 
T-shirt, I deserve to wear it. Part of 
it’s a pride thing, but the other part 
is some deep irrational fear that 
I’ll run into another human being 
like myself who will test me, as I’m 
testing all Nirvana T-shirt owners 
with these words.

Knowing all the guts and glory 

behind your choice aesthetic of the 
day makes it that much more worth 
it, at least to me. What angers most 
Nirvana fans is the “style over sub-
stance” mindset many outfitters of 
the urban variety have adapted — 
they prefer the frock for its grunge-
y chic look rather than the fact that 
it reminds them of the sunny tune, 
“Rape Me.” Understandable, but 
not intellectually desirable.

Nevertheless, it’s exposure — the 

fashion world has made sure people 
don’t forget about one of the best 
things that happened to the music 
industry in the ’90s, whether that 
was a conscious move or not. All the 
Forever 21 models are carrying on 
Cobain’s memory, as much as that 
would have nauseated him, per-
haps even inspiring people to revisit 
the justifiably legendary band.

In the meantime, though, I’ve 

only given you seven songs for your 
repertoire. Study up before you slip 
on.

‘Inherent Vice’ a 
difficult head trip

Anderson is a great 
director, but can’t 
engage audience 

By AKSHAY SETH

Daily Film Columnist

Seconds after the last Satur-

day night showing of “Inherent 
Vice,” a 70-year-old man sporting 
a frayed pony-
tail and what 
looked like a 
knitted Hawai-
ian 
poncho 

stared into the 
trashcan. Mov-
iegoers dropped 
empty cartons 
of 
popcorn 

inside. 
They 

walked by. The 
old man gaped, seemingly mes-
merized by its butter-smeared 
bowels. In a crowded Michigan 
multiplex populated mostly by 
youngish college students, mostly 
lamenting how they ‘“should’ve 
seen the movie high,” the man 
appeared out of place — an anach-
ronism lost in a ditty of time. He 
looked like he listened to sea-
shells, owned beach shorts before 
they were called beach shorts.

And for a few seconds, as I 

stared at the old man who stared 
into the trashcan, I thought 
maybe I’d found an incarnation 
of what Paul Thomas Anderson 
spent 148 minutes (and $35 mil-
lion) constructing. An ode to a 
bygone era forever doomed to 
lament its own demise, to stare 
into nothingness as indifferent 
descendants strolled by.

Then, with a noticeable swell 

of his Hawaiian poncho, a bobble 
of his frayed ponytail, the old man 
threw up his head. He leaned back 
for a moment. I leaned in for a rev-
elation.

He throatily hawked some snot 

into the can. “Well, that was a 
shit-boring movie” was what he 
said before disappearing into the 
night.

I agreed, kind of.
During the car ride home, 

when a friend made an exasper-
ated comment about the film’s 
impenetrable plot — which is to 
say, its unfathomably complex 
clusterfuck of a story — I nodded, 
but clung to a hollow doubt that 
maybe the perplexity was intend-
ed. Maybe Anderson wanted half 
the theater to collectively mutter 
“whaaat the shit” under its breath 
as credits rolled. After all, the 
writing does accurately convey 
the tortuous Thomas Pynchon 
prose that inspired it. So maybe 
the head scratching was all part of 
the high? Maybe destiny intended 
me to look for answers in a pon-
cho-draped geezer? Maybe?

Nah.
The film’s most obvious failing 

comes in the form of its unfor-
giving storytelling. It starts and 
ends with Doc Sportello (Joaquin 
Phoenix, “The Master”), an eter-
nally-stoned 1960s private eye 

tasked by his ex, Shasta (Kather-
ine Waterston, “Being Flynn”), to 
pinpoint the whereabouts of her 
current beau, the millionaire land 
developer Micky Wolfman. From 
there, this otherwise straightfor-
ward noir rambles through hazes 
of marijuana fumes to greet Nazi 
bikers, cocaine-addled dentists, 
lesbian prostitutes and Owen 
Wilson’s Nose in a journey that 
climaxes in achieving not much 
more than further muddlement.

The head trip escalates in 

paranoia as Anderson and Pyn-
chon’s threadbare strands of plot 
bind and intertwine themselves 
around an ethereal criminal orga-
nization called The Golden Fang, 
which seems to have sunk its teeth 
squarely into every illegitimate pie 
baking in fringe Los Angeles. Then 
as the film progresses and sinks 
deeper into conspiracy-laden con-
fusion, something weird happens.

The audience gives up. It set-

tles back, it reclines in cinema 
hall seats, it watches as Anderson 
attempts a brand of comedy inher-
ently tied to Phoenix’s mutton 
chops. He’s what would happen if 
Winnie the Pooh met a few pounds 
of reefer — so well-intentioned, 
you often wonder how he manages 
to even fathom an act of wrongdo-
ing let alone confront it. An air of 
optimistic puzzlement frames his 
every move, and Phoenix uses the 
lethargy well, drawing consistent 
laughs with the smallest facial tics 
awkwardness can allow.

The 
whimsical 
physical-

ity of that portrayal is contrasted 
sharply by Josh Brolin’s (“No 
Country For Old Men”) Christian 
“Bigfoot” Bjornsen, renaissance 
LAPD officer, lover of chocolate-
dipped bananas and hater of 
all things hippie. Where Sport-
ello whispers, Bjornsen screams. 
Where Phoenix toddles, Brolin 
marches. Yet, there’s a weird 
kinship developing between the 
characters that Anderson wants 
us to see. It’s emblazoned some-
where in that bygone-era ethos 
evoked throughout much of the 
movie, but subtler notes slip 
through in the two actors’ inter-
actions. We see it when they play 
off each other, when they talk.

There’s 
never 
any 
doubt-

ing how Doc’s earnest, carefree 

behavior is going to be gobbled 
up by the impending ’70s, as is 
Bjornsen’s squareness, but there’s 
also solace in knowing the hippie 
lived/smoked a life he wanted in 
the time he had. The sunset feels 
decidedly more cataclysmic for 
his companion.

Brolin conveys a hidden vul-

nerability in his character’s oper-
atic chest-beating that rings like 
a cry for help. He’s been hiding 
behind the straight lace for so 
long, even the drawn out, slow 
scenes where we see him doing 
nothing but sucking away at his 
chocolate-dipped bananas feel 
fraught with homoerotic under-
tones. It’s enough to warrant a 
laugh, and Anderson makes sure 
to offer them up every chance he 
gets, though the subtext here is 
gloomy at best.

The humor carries the free-

wheeling, lowbrow feel Pynchon 
wrote into his novel, and often, 
the punchlines are clearly better 
on paper than when stretched out 
on screen. But the movie doesn’t 
suffer for want of steadiness — 
there are enough chuckles to be 
had in the utter absurdity of the 
images to keep audiences watch-
ing. Confused, but watching.

The real culprit is hollowness, 

an impermeable “why” you keep 
asking yourself at the end of every 
scene, and, ultimately, a “why” 
that stretches itself across the 
whole film. Anderson’s response 
to that “why” would likely be 
to forget it even exists: Let the 
strangeness wash over you, mar-
vel at the way it seeps into the 
smallest of plot devices, and only 
if you get the time, lean in for the 
much nastier shit growing inside 
— the class warfare, the racial 
tension, the hard drugs power-
ing it all forward. The stuff that’s 
inevitable.

Making a film about the beach, 

coursing with soft dissolves and a 
cleansing sanguinity redolent of 
the tides, may just be Anderson’s 
way of finding some nostalgia in all 
that violence. It may simply be Doc 
curled down in a fetal position, 
thinking about that ex who will 
never really be just an ex, as a pha-
lanx of police officers steps over 
him. What it’s not, well, at least not 
completely, is a shit-boring movie.

“Two ounces of weed, please.”

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

When hundreds of great songs of 

all genres are released every year, 
it’s no surprise that The Michigan 
Daily’s “Top Songs of the Year” bal-
lots are consistently wide-ranging 
and diverse, with plenty of worthy 
tracks snubbed in the final annual 
list. With this in mind, Daily Arts 
Writer Rachel Kerr would like to 
present an alternative list: her own 
personal choices for 2014’s best 
music.
1. “2 On” – Tinashe ft. School-

boy Q

Tinashe told ThisIsRnB that “2 

on” means “when you’re like a lit-
tle too turnt up. It’s like being extra 
just like whatever you’re doing.” 
And Urban Dictionary tells us it 
literally means to be on two differ-
ent substances — “to be drunk and 
high at the same time.” Whatever 
the hell it means, this undeniably 
catchy song channels the univer-
sal feeling of going out and making 
some regrettable — but enjoyable 
— decisions. Who can’t relate?

2. “After Ur Gone” – Alex G
Alex Giannascoli, better known 

as “Alex G,” is a Temple Univer-
sity student who has quietly been 
uploading music to the Internet for 
years now. Reminiscent of indie-
rock favorites such as Built to Spill 
or the late Elliot Smith, “After Ur 
Gone” succeeds by contrasting the 
rocker’s fragile vocals with hectic 
bits of electric guitar. The track 
appears on Giannascoli’s first full-
length album DSU.

3. “Gone Down the River” – 

Fletcher C. Johnson

There’s something about this 

track that just feels right — it’s 

both authentic and natural. “Gone 
Down the River” sounds senti-
mental, but not sappy; meaning-
ful, but also fun. It’s hard not to 
appreciate the infectious rhythm 
of the 7-minute track as it dances 
beautifully between country and 
rock-n-roll.

4. “Continental Shelf” – Viet 

Cong

“Continental Shelf” is the kind 

of postpunk I love. It’s loud and 
unsettling and makes you a bit 
nervous. The clanging of the gui-
tar could be overwhelming, if not 
for the hypnotizing melody car-
rying the track. It sounds very 
Interpol-esque, but back when 
they were young and still making 
good music.

5. “Tuesday” – ILOVEMA-

KONNEN ft. Drake

As a loyal Drake fan, I first 

listened to this song only for 
his verse. After my first listen, I 
believe I even called this song “ter-
rible.” But the song has a way of 
growing on you. Makonnen’s jag-
ged, unconventional rapping style, 
which I once found annoying, is 
actually pretty upbeat and catchy. 
You can’t help but sing along as he 
sings, “Got the club goin’ up, on a 
Tuesday,” no matter what day it is.

6. “Brother” – Mac DeMarco
Mac Demarco’s Salad Days was 

hailed by many as one of the best 
albums of 2014. With its release, 
DeMarco’s already large cult fol-
lowing grew even larger. “Broth-
er” showcases everything that is 
great about the album – dreamy 
lyrics, lackadaisical guitar riffs 
and some good advice about grow-
ing up – “you’re better off dead / 
when your minds been set / from 
nine until five.”

7. “Without U” – Spooky 

Black

It’s hard not be intrigued by a 

white kid wearing a turtleneck and 
du-rag who starts uploading music 
to the Internet. What’s even more 
intriguing is how difficult this kid 
is to define. Spooky Black is in the 
same league as rising irony-tinged 
rappers Yung Lean and Lil B, art-
ists whose creativity is constantly 
questioned and rarely understood. 
“Without U” demonstrates Black’s 
surprising range as an R&B artist, 
proving that he should be taken 
seriously.

8. “Hella Hoes” – A$AP Mob
If you like ignorant rap, you 

can’t not love this song. What’s 
better than A$AP Mob standouts 
Ferg and Rocky, along with their 
counterparts, literally just rapping 
over and over again, “I got hoes?” 
Doesn’t get much better than that.

9. “Blue Suede” – Vince Sta-

ples

Beginning with its siren-like 

intro, “Blue Suede” seethes 
with urgency and paranoia. The 
beat is loud, and Vince Staples’s 
lyrics are explicit. It was the 
first single from Staples’s first 
official EP Hell Can Wait. The 
track is best played at maxi-
mum volume, so you can’t hear 
yourself attempting to rap along 
as Staples aggressively tell us, 
“Bitches ain’t shit but hoes and 
tricks.”

10. “Off the Corner” – Meek 

Mill ft. Rick Ross

I once had a friend say he’d kill a 

person for this beat. Dramatic, but 
a testimony to the strength of the 
track (or my friend’s sanity.) But 
when Rick Ross goes in, it’s hard 
not to agree.

Daily Arts Writer

One of the treats of the Marvel 

Cinematic Universe is the manner 
in which creators have portrayed 
its 
intricate 

design through 
various settings 
and 
perspec-

tives. Such is the 
case with Mar-
vel’s most recent 
television series, 
“Agent Carter.”

It’s 1946 New 

York City and 
Agent 
Peggy 

Carter (Hayley 
Atwell, “Captain America: The 
First Avenger”) is picking up the 
pieces of her life following the 
end of World War II and the loss 
of Steve Rogers/Captain America 
(Chris Evans, “Snowpiercer”). But 
the show is more than just a “Cap-
tain America” spin-off. Creators 
Christopher Markus and Stephen 
McFeely (“The Life and Death of 
Peter Sellers”) bring the sly politi-
cal commentary that made “Cap-
tain America: The Winter Soldier” 
such a hit. The duo write a solid 
pilot, albeit one that is somewhat 
safe, before they give the reins over 
to the more-than-capable show-
runners Tara Butters and Michele 
Fazekas (“Reaper”).

Whereas “Winter Soldier” was 

a paranoid political thriller and 
“First Avenger” a nostalgic pulp 
swashbuckler, 
“Agent 
Carter” 

finds itself somewhere in the mid-
dle. In the pilot, inventor Howard 
Stark (Dominic Cooper, “My Week 
With Marilyn”) is accused of trea-
son and branded a fugitive. He 
enlists the help of Carter to use her 
connections with the Strategic Sci-
ence Reserve to clear his name and 
bring those responsible to justice. 
As Carter evades her male supe-
riors, she stumbles upon a secret 
organization called “Leviathan” 
which may or may not be stealing 
Stark’s weapons and selling them 
on the black market.

The revelation of a secret orga-

nization with an ominous name 
might not be the most origi-
nal move, but it does clue comic 
fans in on the potential thematic 
path of the series. In the comics, 
Leviathan is an organization that 
stems from Stalinism in the same 
way Hydra stems from Nazism. 
Though it’s too early to say for cer-
tain if “Agent Carter” will be the 
MCU’s take on McCarthyism, it 
would make sense given Marvel’s 
love of “pop with purpose.”

A lot of the heart in “Agent 

Carter” is thanks to its lead, Hay-
ley Atwell. The pilot has plenty of 
gunshots, punches and supernatu-
ral craziness, but it also features 
Atwell’s confident and soulful 
performance. If some found Peggy 

in “First Avenger” as just another 
beautiful 
love-interest, 
“Agent 

Carter” smashes that notion with 
a roundhouse kick to the face. She 
balances action chops, wit and a 
tragic sense of loss with subtlety 
and charm.

Though Atwell is great, some of 

the cast in the pilot feel a bit unde-
rused. Shea Whigham (“Board-
walk Empire”) is a little shallow 
as Carter’s sexist supervisor — a 
shame given the actor’s spectac-
ular resume. Nightclub owner 
Spider Raymond (Andre Royo, 
“The Wire”) was killed off early 
in, which was also disappointing. 
That being said, it was fascinat-
ing seeing Chad Michael Murray 
(“One Tree Hill”) embrace the 
sleaziness of his pretty boy image 
as Agent Jack Thompson. And it’s 
interesting to speculate where 
the show might take Enver Gjokaj 
(“Dollhouse”) as a well-meaning, 
wounded war-vet and fellow agent.

While the pilot of “Agent Carter” 

doesn’t reinvent the wheel, Marvel 
has created an exciting action-
adventure series that announces a 
brave new talent in Hayley Atwell. 
The upcoming “Daredevil” series 
might be Marvel’s bolder television 
property, but “Agent Carter” does a 
hell of a job proving that the House 
of Ideas can make mainstream hits 
outside the movie theater and still 
attract the best talent in entertain-
ment.

‘Carter’ a promising 
new take on Marvel

OOP, THERE IT IS

home win over Minnesota on Saturday, 
the Wolverines’ second straight victory.

but the plays that don’t show up in the 
box score merit Hobey Baker consider-
ation, writes Erin Lennon. Page 2B

R

ed Berenson hopes this story will be about 
something other than himself.

His team just beat 

the No. 9 team in the country, 
won eight of its last nine games 
and moved to the top of the 
Big Ten standings, but I’m not 
discussing that success. Instead, 
I feel compelled to write about 
his 800th win as a coach in his 
college hockey career, because it’s 
mind-boggling that someone can 
win 800 games at any level in any 
sport.

Berenson joined a list of three 

other coaches in college hockey Saturday night, and 
it’s important that everyone realizes how much effort 
and how much time goes into that achievement. 
There are no more than 40 games in a season, and 
that’s only if a team makes the Frozen Four. Berenson 
is now 800-391-84 in 31 seasons.

He started when he was 44 years old, compared to 

the three other 800-game winners — Jerry York, Ron 
Mason and Jack Parker — who all started before they 
turned 29. He had to transform a struggling program 
that couldn’t pay its fans to attend games into one 
that captured two national championships.

Feats such as these are rare and special. But then, 

so are coaches like Berenson. These are the feats that 
capture the attention of those who otherwise haven’t 
kept track or wouldn’t pay attention. These are the 
feats that deserve that attention.

But he doesn’t want this story written. He’s not 

interested in celebrating the accomplishment any 
more than he’s interested in celebrating his birthday.

“I read about (the milestone) more than I think 

about it,” he said on Wednesday. “I just had my 75th 
birthday, and I didn’t celebrate that, and I didn’t 
celebrate New Years and I didn’t even celebrate the 
GLI (the team’s first title since 2011).”

***

T

his milestone almost never happened. Just 
last year, Berenson was ready to retire. 
Michigan had lost in the first round of the Big 

Ten Tournament and missed out on the postseason 
for the second year in a row.

He said he thought about leaving hockey because 

he “can’t handle losing” and “can’t handle a team 
underachieving.” He’s back now, of course, but was 
willing to leave hockey because he knows losing 
starts with the coaching staff, and he wasn’t leading 
his team to success.

There’s a story — one Berenson may not even 

remember — of a little boy and his grandfather 
meeting him for the first time. They are introduced, 
and Berenson asks the seven-year-old, “Do you know 
how to skate?”

The boy acknowledged that he had not learned 

how. With a straight face, Berenson replied, “If you 
can’t skate, then you can’t play hockey, and if you 
can’t play hockey, then what are you?”

Berenson’s life is hockey. But he’s willing to give it 

up in order for the Wolverines to win.

Mr. 800

Berenson gets win No. 800 as 

Michigan sweeps No. 9 Minnesota 

at Yost

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

Red Berenson’s 31-year tenure as the head coach of 

the Michigan hockey program has comprised an era of 
prestige laden with countless awards and accomplish-
ments.

His first-ever win came in Berenson’s first game as 

head coach of his alma mater on Oct. 12, 1984, a 6-4 
victory at Miami (Ohio). And on Saturday, Berenson 
became the fourth coach to eclipse the 800-win mark 
after his Wolverines pounded Minnesota, 7-5.

“I can remember my first game at Michigan was 

at Miami and we won the game, and our team was so 
surprised that we won that they were celebrating like 
we’d won the Stanley Cup, and I knew we were in trou-
ble,” Berenson said.

However, in just a few years, things took a drastic 

turn, as Berenson began to build Michigan hockey 
into a dynasty. The journey from his first win against 
Miami (Ohio) to Saturday’s victory has been a long 
but memorable one with two national titles, 11 Frozen 
Four appearances, 11 conference championships and 
22 NCAA Tournament berths sandwiched in between.

Behind four first-period goals, the Wolverines (4-1 

Big Ten, 12-7 overall) put an old-fashioned beatdown 
on the ninth-ranked Golden Gophers (1-2-1, 10-7-1) for 
their eighth win in their past 10 games.

“We were happy with the amount of goals we put up, 

obviously, offensively,” said sophomore forward Tyler 
Motte. “But defensively, we gave up a little too much 
in our D-zone. We’ll give up shots as long as they’re 
not grade-A opportunities, and that’s what we saw too 
much of, I think, this weekend.”

With Michigan clinging on to a 2-1 lead in the final 

minute of the first period, senior forward Zach Hyman 
and sophomore forward JT Compher scored exactly 
30 seconds apart to take a 4-1 lead into the first inter-
mission. The other Wolverine goals came off the sticks 
of senior forward Travis Lynch and junior forward 
Andrew Copp at the 12:48 and 14:27 marks, respec-
tively.

“Coach (Berenson) was on us that we need to be 

prepared and start on time today,” Hyman said. “Even 
though we gave up that first goal, I think we outshot 
them in the first period and getting four back in the 
period, we end up exploding a little bit in that period, 
and that was huge for us.”

Minnesota forward Travis Boyd carried a large load 

all weekend, tallying a goal in Friday’s contest before 
netting the first two goals for the Golden Gophers 
on Saturday. His first was the product of a perfectly 
threaded pass from forward Seth Ambroz, who split 
the Michigan defense just over seven minutes into the 
game.

Ambroz would also net a goal of his own with a well-

executed redirect off a shot from the point, coming 
just 14 seconds after Michigan’s sophomore defense-
man Michael Downing scored his fourth of the season. 
Downing’s tally was enough for coach Don Lucia to 
pull the reigning Big Ten Goaltender of the Year, Adam 
Wilcox, for the first time all season.

Playing a large part in Michigan’s offensive outburst 

was Dylan Larkin, who’s coming off a dynamite per-
formance for Team USA in the World Junior Champi-
onships. Larkin never missed a beat upon his return to 
Ann Arbor, as he would net the Wolverines’ final two 
goals to extend his point total to 20 on the year.

“A lot’s going right,” Copp said regarding Michi-

gan’s offense. “I think our power play did a really good 
job today… We’re getting pucks behind their (defense), 
we’re cycling pretty well down low, we’re scoring off 
the rush, scoring off faceoffs, power play like I said, 
so it seems like any possible way that we can put the 
puck in the net, it’s going

in the net.”

The Golden Gophers seemed 

to answer nearly every time 
Michigan found twine, but for-
ward Connor Reilly’s goal in 
the closing minute of the second 
period seemed to be the final 
threat. Forward A.J. Michaelson 
scored from the slot with under 
three minutes remaining, but 
neither his nor Reilly’s tally was 
enough to overcome the Wolver-
ines’ well-cushioned lead.

“It’s tough to win up in Min-

neapolis, so holding serve here 

at Yost is really important for 
us,” Copp said. “You know, 
and in Pairwise (rankings) and 
NCAA 
implications, 
I 
don’t 

know where we’re at but we’re 
right on the borderline now, and 
if we keep playing the way we’re 
playing, we’ll find ourselves in 
the tournament.”

Earlier in the week, Beren-

son said he wouldn’t celebrate 
his 800th victory, but a sweep 
of Minnesota is enough to make 
even the most stoic of coaches 
crack a smile.

“I just had my 75th birthday, 

and I didn’t celebrate that, and I 
didn’t celebrate New Years and 
I didn’t even celebrate the GLI,” 
Berenson said after Wednesday’s 

practice. “I mean, I was glad. To 
me, the best part of the GLI is 
in the locker room for the two 
or three minutes after the game 
where everyone can sit there and 
say, ‘Wow this is great.’

“They’re sweaty, they’re sore, 

they hurt, they’re tired and 
they’re happy and they’re ful-
filled.”

Exactly 
800 
times 
now, 

Berenson has felt that satis-
faction from walking into a 
locker room and standing over 
a sweaty, sore, hurt, tired and 
happy bunch of Wolverines. He 
won’t admit Saturday’s victory is 
sweeter than another, but this is 
one of many that will be etched 
into the record books.

O

n the second floor 
of Yost Ice Arena is 
the media interview 

room. There are pictures of 
Michigan teams celebrating 
championships, trophies from 
the two Hobey Baker winners, 
awards for the countless 
conference championships and 
national titles.

It has two couches and 

an armchair along the walls 
facing inward. There’s a blue, 
leather armchair, just like one a 
grandfather 
would have 
fallen asleep 
in, at the 
head of the 
room. It 
faces the 
trophies 
and the 
pictures and 
the people 
who have 
come to 
speak with 
Berenson.

Everything around the 

room, including that blue chair, 
serves as a constant reminder 
about the success at Michigan. 
Berenson doesn’t keep plaques 
or trophies for reaching 800 
wins, because he cares more 
about seeing his players 
graduate with a degree than he 
does about cranking out draft 

picks. He keeps those awards 
because he cares about his team 
more.

“He’s always hungry, always 

looking for the next best thing,” 
said junior forward Andrew 
Copp.

His wins have never been 

about himself. Berenson will 
be quick to remind you he’s 
got a creative, offensive mind 
in assistant head coach Brian 
Wiseman and an experienced 
defensive leader in associate 
coach Billy Powers that make 
him look smart.

He has had players like Jack 

Johnson, Marty Turco, Brendan 

Morrison 
and Mike 
Knuble, all of 
whom played 
some of their 
best hockey 
for him. 
Berenson’s 
biggest 
smile on the 
night of his 
800th win 
came when 
he realized 

Knuble was in the back of the 
interview room, watching his 
coach dismiss how big a feat he 
accomplished.

“I think it’s good before 

it became too much of a 
conversation piece,” Berenson 
said. “It’s not really about me, 
but something happens like this 
every 100 games, I guess.”

Added senior forward Zach 

Hyman: “Someone asked him, 
‘You’re at 799, did you know 
that?’ And he responded with, 
‘Yeah, if you’re counting.’ So 
he’s a humble guy, and you don’t 
see it on his face a lot.”

***

T

he horn sounded on 
Saturday evening and 
the camera panned to 

Berenson, not to the team’s 
celebration. He exhaled, as if 
winning his 800th game was a 
relief.

The crowd chanted “Thank 

you, Red,” while the student 
section bowed in appreciation. 
Berenson gave a slight wave 
to the crowd, but was no more 
excited than any other win. He 
walked off the ice and into a 
locker room applauding him.

“You look around the locker 

room and you feel better about 
the guys you’re playing with, 
you feel better about your 
team,” Berenson said in the 
locker room after the game. 
“That’s how I feel as a coach.”

Win No. 800 doesn’t feel 

much different than win No. 1, 
because each one is about the 
success of the Michigan hockey 
team.

So now, Berenson is most 

excited that everyone will 
finally be able to move past 
the milestone. He can focus on 
beating Ohio State next for win 
No. 801.

You know, if you’re counting.

Zach Hyman deserves 

your attention

utler Martin glided

teammates after netting 

the overtime 
game-win-
ner Friday, 
securing 
the Michi-
gan hockey 
team’s come-
back win 
over No. 9 
Minnesota.

Everyone 

had watched 
as Martin 
buried the shot that ended the 
series opener.

But nobody had seen the 

player who set up the dramatic 
tally, the player who embraced 
him in a bear hug after the goal: 
Zach Hyman.

Hyman, a senior forward, 

tallied six points in the sweep. 
Both nights, he led the team 
with six shots and finished 
plus-four in the series.

Yet the individual 

performance — which came 
against one of the best defenses 
in the country — was typical 
for the alternate captain, who 
surpassed his career best in 
points just 15 games into his 
senior season.

The numbers tell us Zach 

Hyman is worthy of Hobey 
Baker-type attention.

Hyman now leads Michigan 

and the Big Ten in points, 
while his 11 goals rank first 
on the team and second in 
the conference. And after 
upping his season total to an 
impressive 26 points in 19 
games, the Florida Panthers 
prospect is now No. 5 in scoring 
in the country.

Hyman is consistent. He’s 

clutch. He’s fast. He’s capable 
of leading a talent-filled roster 
at any level.

Right now, Zach Hyman is 

the player who deserves the 
most attention from opposing 
defenses. His teammates know 
that, even if he won’t take the 
credit.

“I’m fortunate to be playing 

with really good players,” 
Hyman said Saturday. “The 
puck is going in for me right 
now, and that’s always nice to 
see.”

And if you pay just a little 

more attention to the No. 11 
jersey, you’ll see Hyman’s 
contributions extend beyond 
the box score.

With just under 12 minutes 

remaining in the third frame 
Friday, junior forward Andrew 
Copp sent Minnesota forward 
Kyle Rau into the boards, and 
roughed several Gophers en 
route to the penalty box. He 
was tossed from the game 
and, after three minutes of 
the five-minute penalty kill, 
junior goaltender Steve Racine 
had allowed two goals, giving 
Minnesota a sudden 3-2 lead.

So while the captain watched 

from the locker room, Hyman 
became general of the offense, 
finding junior forward Justin 
Selman to regain the tie 
midway through the period.

“I didn’t even see the goal,” 

Hyman said Friday.

That’s because as he threw 

the puck in front of the net, 
Hyman was already on his 
back, falling into the boards.

Hyman isn’t the kind of 

player who demands attention; 
he’s the kind 
that deflects 
it to his 
teammates.

“(Freshman 

defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski) 
made that 
play, and then 
I don’t know 
how I got the 
puck, but I 
luckily got the puck, and I just 
wanted to take it wide on their 
‘D,’” he said of his own tally.

Playing alongside the 15th 

overall pick in the 2014 NHL 
Draft in freshman Dylan Larkin 
means Hyman’s success has 
often been associated with the 
center.

At the Great Lakes 

Invitational, without brand-
name players like Larkin and 
Werenski, it was Hyman who 
anchored a blue-collar effort 
in Michigan’s first title since 
his freshman year. On a new 
line, Hyman added game-
winning goals against both 
Michigan Tech and Michigan 
State, contributing half of the 
Wolverines’ offense.

Simply put, Hyman is the 

kind of player Michigan needs 
to model its offense after if it 
wants to win against gritty 
teams like Michigan Tech and 
Minnesota in a postseason run.

“If you look at the stats 

here, one goal, three assists, 
six shots,” Larkin said Friday. 

“You can tell he’s stepping up 
and taking our team to the next 
level. It’s fun to watch, and he 
is fun to play with.”

On Saturday, with five 

minutes remaining in the first 
period, Hyman, pinned to the 
boards, won a puck from his 
knees, drawing a penalty before 
skating around to fire a shot 
before the whistle sounded.

Three seconds and one pass 

later, the unit scored a power-
play goal.

At times, Hyman makes 

players like Copp and 
sophomore forward JT 
Compher, U.S. National Team 
Development Program players 
who have received their share 
of media attention well before 
stepping foot onto campus, look 
mediocre.

With 42.7 seconds remaining 

in the period, the alternate 
captain took a puck through 
the neutral zone, splitting 

two Gophers 
defenders en 
route to an 
unassisted 
goal.

“I know 

he’s fast,” 
Martin said. 
“He’s the 
fastest kid on 
our team, for 
sure.”

None of 

this, though, should come as a 
surprise to those who follow 
Michigan hockey closely.

Hyman has long been 

known as one of the hardest 
workers and one of the better 
two-way players on the team. 
His 17-point junior season 
was a career best, which is 
noteworthy considering he 
spent time at both center and 
winger.

When he isn’t scoring 

or offering praise for his 
linemates, Hyman is listening 
and leading by example.

During a goal review in the 

second period, Hyman stood 
alone in the crease talking with 
Racine before skating back to 
the Michigan bench to deliver a 
message to Berenson.

Several minutes later, Racine 

left the game due to a foot 
injury and was replaced by 
sophomore Zach Nagelvoort.

It was Hyman who paid 

attention to Racine.

It’s time to start paying 

attention to Zach Hyman.

Power trio lifts ‘M’ 
over OSU in OT

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

Freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty made a 3-pointer. And 
another.

There were 50 seconds left in 

regulation when she received 
the ball at the top of the key. 
Unguarded and 24 feet from the 
hoop, she drained the 3-pointer 
with a flick of her wrist, tying 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team with Ohio State at 82, 
forcing overtime and sending 
Crisler Center into a mad frenzy.

The Wolverines (3-2 Big Ten, 

11-5 overall) got the ball to start 
an electric five-minute battle, 
and Michigan played its best 
basketball of the season. Rebound 
by rebound and intangible by 
intangible, 
the 
Wolverines 

controlled overtime and came out 
with a thrilling 100-94 victory 
over the Buckeyes.

Flaherty, 
alongside 
senior 

guard Shannon Smith and senior 
forward Cyesha Goree, led the 
charge against Ohio State, and all 
scored in double digits.

“It was pretty incredible,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I’m so proud of our 
seniors and of our entire team 
for the way that they battled and 
played today.”

Michigan paved the way for 

its first 100-point scoring total 
since 1998 with the help of a full-
court press on defense, which 
held Buckeyes guard Kelsey 
Mitchell — the nation’s leading 
scorer with 26 points per game 
— to zero points by halftime and 
just 13 overall. Near halftime, 
the defense cooled down before 
firing back up late in the game.

As the defense clicked once 

again, so did Flaherty, who had 
started the game in a slump. 
After losing control of the ball 
twice in the first half, resulting 
in four points for the Buckeyes, 
she was benched. But when the 
stakes rose, she reverted back to 
her usual 3-point finesse.

To start the extra minutes, 

Flaherty followed up her clutch 
shot with another open triple 
from the same spot — ending the 
game with a career-best 24 points.

“Coming 
out 
(my 
3-point 

shooting) felt good, and then, just 
like Michigan State, I missed a 
lot,” Flaherty said. “But at the end, 
I started hitting them again. And 
my teammates find me in great 
spots that I’m wide open for.”

Then there was Smith, who 

was fearless en route to a career-
high 36 points.

Whether absorbing contact 

when driving to the basket or 

taking a charge, she executed 
every intangible there was and 
helped launch the Wolverines 
into overtime by scoring five 
quick points in 18 seconds.

During that span, Flaherty dove 

on the floor to steal the ball and 
passed to Smith, who was already 
in transition and faced only one 
defender to make an easy layup. 
The crowd jumped to its feet, and 
Smith signaled to get loud.

Whenever Michigan missed 

shots, it seemed as though Goree 
was always there to take the ball 
back. Goree — who had a double-
double in the first half alone — 
ended the game with 18 points 
and a career-tying 19 rebounds. 
Goree halted several crucial 
Buckeye possessions and helped 
Michigan outrebound Ohio State, 
45-31.

“She is the number one person 

in everyone’s scouting report,” 
Barnes Arico said. “That speaks 
to her work ethic, her motor and 
her desire and passion to be a 
great basketball player.”

The Wolverines have now 

beaten Penn State, Michigan 
State and Ohio State in the same 
season for the first time since 
2001.

If the trend continues, even 

bigger things could be on the 
horizon.

Wolverines are answering 

their own questions

W

ith the final seconds 
of overtime ticking 
down on the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 
100-94 win 
against Ohio 
State, coach 
Kim Barnes 
Arico looked 
out onto the 
court and 
smiled.

And she kept smiling as she 

went down her bench, hugging 
every player, coach and trainer.

“I know how incredibly hard 

everyone works everyday, and 
I was just so proud of them,” 
said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “This is an Ohio 
State team that’s been playing 
extremely well that has a lot of 
talented kids on their team, and 
we stuck together to find a way 
to win.”

Her team had just beaten a 

Buckeye squad that had won 
seven in its last eight games, 
a team that featured the first 
and 15th-leading scorers in the 
nation, and everything that could 
have possibly gone right went 
right for Barnes Arico and the 
Wolverines.

Before the season began, there 

were four big question marks 
that Barnes Arico was concerned 
with: rebounding, senior forward 
Cyesha Goree, youth and the 
strength of the Big Ten.

When Barnes Arico started 

her hug line, she did so because 
her questions had been 
emphatically answered.

First, there was rebounding.
While Michigan is still one 

of the shortest teams in the Big 
Ten, rebounding hasn’t been as 
big of an issue as Barnes Arico 
thought it would be.

The Wolverines have stood 

their ground on both the 
offensive and defensive glass 
with Goree and senior forward 
Nicole Elmblad leading the 
charge, grabbing a majority 
of the rebounds. But with 
contributions from freshman 
forward Jillian Dunston and 
senior guard Shannon Smith, 
Michigan has done just fine on 
the glass.

Sunday’s game against the 

Buckeyes showcased the team’s 
rebounders, with Goree pulling 
down 19 while Elmblad had 
eight. As a team, the Wolverines 
outrebounded Ohio State by 14 
by the end of the game.

The Wolverines are still an 

undersized team, and with the 
rest of the Big Ten schedule 
looming, rebounding is a 
question they are going to have 
to continue answering every 
single night.

But against the Buckeyes, they 

looked like they had a cheat sheet 
decoding the bounces of the ball.

The second worry Barnes 

Arico had was whether or not 
Goree could repeat her second 
team All-Big Ten performance 
now that she has received some 
recognition for her efforts.

While Goree wasn’t double 

teamed as much against Ohio 
State, she has had to fend off 
double and even triple teams 
most games. But she has found 
a way to still average a double-
double.

“She is the number-one 

person on everyone’s scouting 
reports after she wasn’t on 
anyone’s scouting report last 
year,” Barnes Arico said.

Added Smith: “I think we have 

the best big in the country.”

And Sunday against Ohio 

State, Goree only strengthened 
that opinion.

Not only did Goree earn 

herself a double-double by 
halftime, she played the 
intangibles — diving for loose 
balls or fighting for space inside 
— as well as anyone could have.

With 18 points to go along 

with 19 rebounds, Goree made 
a statement to the rest of the 
league that she is going to be 
an inside presence every night, 
despite her name appearing at 
the top of every team’s scouting 
report.

But Goree is just one piece. 

Other teams still know Michigan 
has just three seniors, and no 
matter how Goree and her senior 
counterparts played, Barnes 
Arico was worried about the 
youth of the team and if they 
would be able to handle the 
pressures of a tough Big Ten 
schedule.

But Sunday, over half 

of the players who played 
for the Wolverines were 

underclassmen, and while they 
didn’t have as much impact 
as Smith or Goree, all five 
underclassmen contributed in 
some way.

Freshman guard Katelynn 

Flaherty was on point, as usual, 
with her shot, scoring 24 points 
on six-for-11 shooting from 
behind the arc, and bounced 
back from her four-point 
performance at Rutgers.

Flaherty has answered her 

coach’s questions about youth 
by making Barnes Arico forget 
there ever was one.

“Sometimes I have to remind 

myself that she is still a freshman 
playing college basketball at the 
highest level,” Barnes Arico said.

Sophomore Danielle Williams’ 

hustle and defense were integral 
as she was a big part of a full-
court press that stonewalled 
the Buckeyes from crossing half 
court at times.

And while freshman forward 

Jillian Dunston and sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson both 
struggled with foul trouble, the 
duo still contributed a combined 
10 points to the cause.

But even if all of those things 

went well, Barnes Arico was 
worried about the talent of the 
Big Ten. But after five games of 
conference play, the Wolverines 
have proven that they can 
hang with the best in the Big 
Ten, as they have beaten three 
top teams in the conference, 
including both of last year’s 
co-champions in Penn State and 
Michigan State.

“The challenge every night is 

to keep that intensity each and 
every single night, because if you 
have a letdown in this league, 
you’re going to lose.”

Michigan’s loss to Rutgers on 

Wednesday gave Barnes Arico 
little to smile about, but after 
its win over Ohio State, Barnes 
Arico couldn’t stop grinning.

Just because the Wolverines 

answered all of Barnes Arico’s 
preseason questions doesn’t 
necessarily mean Michigan will 
win the national championship, 
because it is going to have to 
answer the same questions night 
in and night out.

But for one game, at least, 

everyone contributed to the 
victory.

And everyone got a hug.

Michigan splits on weekend

‘M’ falls just short 

against No. 2 

Minnesota but tops 

Michigan State

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — Reflecting 

the poise and strength Paul 
Bunyan used to cut down trees, 
the Michigan wrestling team 
nearly took down a giant of its 
own.

The 15th-ranked Wolverines 

fell just short of a road upset of 
No. 1 Minnesota on Friday, 20-19, 
and came back on Sunday to beat 
down in-state rival Michigan 
State, 28-9. 

Michigan 
went 
5-5 
in 

individual matches on Friday 
and 7-3 on Sunday.

“Our goal was to make sure 

we put (the loss at Minnesota) 
behind us,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “I think the guys 
did a pretty good job of that.”

The big story from Friday was 

No. 8 sophomore heavyweight 
Adam Coon. With Michigan (1-1 
Big Ten, 4-2 overall) down 17-10 
to the Golden Gophers, Coon 

tossed No. 13 Michael Kroells 
onto his back a mere eight 
seconds into his match. Coon 
went on to pin Kroells at the 0:23 
mark to cut the margin to 17-16.

“Having a stopper like (Coon) 

is very important,” McFarland 
said.

Redshirt sophomore Conor 

Youtsey followed up Coon’s 
victory with one of his own, a 
10-7 decision over Jordan Bremer 
in the 125-pound class. Youtsey’s 
win gave the Wolverines their 
first lead of the meet, 19-17.

It also set up a do-or-die 

matchup at the 133-pound weight 
class, with junior Rossi Bruno 
taking on No. 1 Chris Dardanes. 
Bruno 
fought 
valiantly, 
but 

Dardanes scored a takedown 
with less than one minute left 
in the third period, sealing the 
match for himself and the meet 
for Minnesota.

Sunday’s meet against the 

Spartans 
went 
much 
more 

smoothly for Michigan.

Youtsey led off with a victory 

over Mitch Rogaliner, 3-2, in the 
125-pound class.

“(Conor) getting the first 

win was huge in that it gave us 
the momentum for the match,” 
McFarland said.

Bruno followed Youtsey with 

a dominant performance of his 
own, notching a 4-0 win over 
Hermilo Esquivel at 133 pounds.

No. 
13 
Alec 
Pantaleo, 
a 

freshman, and No. 19 Brian 
Murphy, a sophomore, kept 
the 
Wolverines’ 
momentum 

going with 10-3 and 6-0 wins, 
respectively.

Things got tense at the 165-

pound 
match, 
when 
Ryan 

Watts of Michigan State went 
down with an injury late in the 
third period in a close battle. 
Watts eventually got up, but 
No. 10 Taylor Massa, a redshirt 
sophomore, grabbed a win by 
injury default, putting the match 
out of reach. 

The weekend matches capped 

a two-month-long stretch on the 
road for the Wolverines.

Michigan will return to Cliff 

Keen Arena on Jan. 18 to face 
Ohio State in their first home 
dual meet of the 2014-15 season. 
McFarland is excited for his 
team to resume channeling Paul 
Bunyan in Ann Arbor.

“It hasn’t been a typical year,” 

McFarland said of the long road 
stretch. “We usually have at least 
one dual meet at home in the first 
semester. But we always enjoy 
wrestling at Cliff Keen Arena and 
it’ll be nice to be home.”

‘M’ rallies past Gophers, 
moves to 3-1 in Big Ten

Wolverines shake 
slow start, close out 
Minnesota at home

By LEV FACHER 

Managing Editor

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team attempted eight 
3-pointers in the first half of its 
62-57 victory over Minnesota 
on Saturday afternoon. It made 
none.

But the Wolverines made up 

for their long-range struggles, 
and then some, in the second 
half, culminating in a trey 
from sophomore guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. that brought the 
Crisler Center crowd to its feet 
with just over three minutes 
remaining in the game. The shot 
and the ensuing three-turnover 
sequence gave the lead back 
to Michigan after a 14-minute 
stretch in which the Golden 
Gophers held the advantage.

Though 
the 
game, 
at 

that point, hadn’t gone the 
Wolverines’ way, the final nine 
minutes played out exactly 
as they drew them up in the 
timeout huddle.

“It was a little bit of everyone 

(talking in the huddle),” said 
junior guard Spike Albrecht. 
“The main message being, ‘We 
need three straight stops.’ Get 
stops, and get out and run an 
offense.”

It 
was 
an 
afternoon 
of 

oddity in Ann Arbor, but that 
didn’t 
stop 
the 
Wolverines 

from 
orchestrating 
their 

comeback, which began with 
8:56 remaining in the game and 
Minnesota leading by nine.

The 
head-scratching 

moments included sophomore 
guard Zak Irvin backing down 
a 
Minnesota 
defender 
and 

getting whistled for a charge 

while he attempted to finish a 
fast break. Also included were 
freshman forward Ricky Doyle 
missing the front end of the rim 
by several inches on a first-half 
free throw but later banking in 
a foul shot.

To top off the often-sloppy, 

nonsensical 
play, 
freshman 

forward 
Kameron 
Chatman 

twice 
fouled 
the 
Golden 

Gophers’ Andre Hollins on 
3-point attempts. Hollins went 
5-for-6 on the resulting free 
throws.

Hollins remained a thorn 

in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
side 

throughout, as he finished with 
18 points. The Gophers’ Carlos 
Morris added 16 points of his 
own on 7-for-10 shooting from 
the field.

If Minnesota had passed the 

ball as well as it shot it, the game 
might not have been close. But 
the Golden Gophers continually 
provided Michigan an open door 
to victory by coughing up the 
basketball with regularity. The 
Golden Gophers finished with 17 
turnovers, baffling their second-
year coach, Richard Pitino.

“Those 
turnovers 
were 

inexplicable,” Pitino said. “We 
didn’t allow ourselves to win 
the game. … We will not beat 
anybody — home, road, neutral 
— if you do that.”

But despite the 17 turnovers, 

Michigan finished with just 11 
points in offensive transition.

“We just didn’t convert,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“I’m a bit concerned right now 
about our fast break — we’ve 
got to be better at it, and we’ve 
got to work at it more. We’ve 
spent so much time in defensive 
transition, (but) we’ve got to be 
better in offensive transition.”

It wasn’t just the transition 

offense 
that 
struggled, 

especially in the early going.

Michigan 
showed 
only 

sparks of offensive cohesion 
in the first period, with one 
flash of brilliance coming when 
Albrecht left Doyle alone at the 
rim with a sneaky one-handed 
dish. Doyle finished with an 
emphatic two-handed reverse 
dunk that gave a previously 
quiet crowd a rare moment of 
excitement.

But for most of the half, the 

Wolverines had trouble scoring 
simply because of 10-for-28 
shooting from the field. Of the 
made shots, just three came 
from outside the paint.

Trailing by seven, Walton 

drained a pair of foul shots, 
forced a Minnesota turnover 
and used a lightning-quick 
crossover at midcourt to set 
up an alley-oop layup to Irvin. 
A Minnesota turnover forced 
Pitino to take a timeout, which 
Doyle followed with an and-
one layup. Fittingly, he banked 
in the free throw, cutting 
Minnesota’s lead to 49-47.

Michigan fought tooth and 

nail to hold onto its narrow lead 
in the game’s final minutes. 
Doyle drove the nail into the 
coffin with an emphatic dunk 
that put the Wolverines up 59-55.

Irvin attributed the offensive 

improvement in the second 
half largely to Michigan finally 
cracking the Golden Gophers’ 
defensive front.

“We just turned it around, 

tried to get in the paint,” Irvin 
said. “And if they put us in there, 
then we can kick it out.”

The kick-outs led to vastly 

improved 
shooting 
in 
the 

second half — the Wolverines 
went 4-for-10 from beyond the 
arc in the second half, a far cry 
from their eight fruitless first-
half attempts.

Walton and LeVert tied for 

the team lead in scoring with 15 
points each, followed by Doyle 
and Irvin with 12 apiece.

Walton takes over second half

By DANIEL FELDMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Derrick 
Walton 
Jr. 
didn’t 

come to Michigan, according to 
Michigan coach John Beilein, 
as a scorer. The sophomore 
guard took over the reigns of 
the point guard position last 
season from Trey Burke, and was 
surrounded by a bevy of offensive 
weapons around him to ease his 
progression into the Wolverines’ 
system.

This season, however, things 

are different for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team. Walton 
has 
to 
create 
opportunities 

for himself as frequently as he 
needs to create opportunities 
for others. If he looked to pass 
only, the Wolverines’ offense just 
wouldn’t flow.

“He came to us as a pass-first 

guy,” Beilein said. “And while we 
love that, if everyone was just 
playing to pass, you’re not going 
to find anybody open. So, we 
want him to be more aggressive 
shooting the ball.”

With 
38 
seconds 
left 
in 

Michigan’s 
62-57 
win 
over 

Minnesota 
Saturday, 
Walton 

had a choice coming out of a 
Wolverine timeout. According 
to Beilein, four options existed 
for Michigan, which held a two-

point lead.

With Caris LeVert on the 

floor, surely one option was for 
the lanky junior guard to get the 
ball at some point during the 
possession. However, the play 
that Michigan (3-1 Big Ten, 10-6 
overall) and Walton executed 
was something that Michigan 
had never pulled off before, even 
in practice.

As Walton drove towards the 

foul line, he lifted the ball in his 
right hand upward at the hoop, 
offering the deceiving look of a 
hook shot. When he lofted the 
ball in the air, freshman Ricky 
Doyle flew in to grab the ball 
with two hands before throwing 
it down for the dunk, giving 
Michigan a four-point lead.

For the guard that was once so 

pass-centric, it was the threat of a 
shot that allowed Walton to pull 
off the pass.

“I love that he turned his 

shoulders on the last one, got 
down at the foul line and just 
threw up a hook shot,” Beilein 
said.

Added Walton: “All season, 

Ricky has just been finishing 
in a crowd, so of course I have 
confidence throwing it to my big 
fella.”

For 
his 
partner 
in 
the 

backcourt, the explanation was 

simpler for Walton’s pass and 
general excellent play in the game, 
especially in the second half.

“That was D-Walt going to 

work,” said junior guard Spike 
Albrecht. “He just kind of took 
over in that second half.”

Totaling 
15 
points, 
five 

rebounds 
and 
three 
assists, 

Walton looked like his old self, 
not someone still suffering from a 
sprained toe. Making three out of 
Michigan’s four 3-pointers of the 
game, Walton resembled the fast-
on-his-feet thinker and player 
that he’s been known to be.

“Derrick was playing like we 

remember 
Derrick 
playing,” 

Beilein said. “He’s not 100 percent 
healthy, but he was healthier 
today.”

While 
the 
timetable 
for 

Walton to return to full health 
is 
unknown, 
Michigan 
will 

need to rely more than ever on 
his intangibles and creativity, 
whether he practices or not.

“We haven’t done that in a 

game or a practice yet with it 
completed as a dunk,” Beilein 
said. “We practice it a lot, like 
once a week, but we haven’t done 
it in (a game).

“That took a lot of courage to 

do that. And I’m so happy we did 
it — make or miss, it was the right 
play.”
