Union sees room 
for pay growth but 
notes above average 
wages, conditions

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Good 
— 
but 
not 
perfect. 

That’s 
how 
many 
University 

administrators 
and 
lecturers 

describe the current relationship 

between their two groups.

While 
this 
assessment 

acknowledges 
some 
lingering 

problems, especially when it 
comes to salaries, the climate 
places the University in a unique 
position. For the most part, the 
University stands in contrast to 
many other colleges across the 
country that have seen non-tenure 
track 
faculty, 
like 
lecturers, 

mobilizing around a number of 
issues — namely low pay and poor 
work conditions.

A 2014 report by the American 

Association 
of 
University 

Professors 
showed 
that 
on 

average in the United States, 
non-tenure track faculty make 
up 76.4 percent of instructional 
employees. 
In 
2013, 
NPR 

reported that adjunct professors 
— another term for lecturers — 
are paid on average $20,000 to 
$25,000 per year. Those salary 
numbers have inspired protests 
at various institutions over past 
years, including theUniversity 
of 
California, 
Berkeley; 

Northeastern 
University 
and 

Rutgers 
Universitysince 
April 

alone.

However, 
the 
University 

stands out as an anomaly to 
those numbers. Lecturers make 
up 18 percent of all University 
instructional employees, which 
also include tenure-track faculty 
and graduate student instructors. 
The salaries of lecturers vary, but 
they earn a mean salary of $70,358 
and a minimum salary of $34,000, 
according to the University’s 
2014-2015 
salary 
analysis. 

Professors earn an average salary 

of $161,511.

The reasons for the difference 

between the numbers nationally 
and at the University, according to 
both the University and lecturers 
interviewed for this story, is 
largely the Lecturer’s Employees 
Organization, a union formed in 
2003 to confront the University 
on its treatment of lecturers.

In 2004, the LEO negotiated its 

first contract with the University 
on behalf of the lecturers. The 
contract covered the Dearborn 
and Flint campuses in addition 

to the Ann Arbor campus, and set 
minimum salaries with regular 
raises and added increased job 
security and benefits.

In 
an 
interview 
with 

The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
LEO 

President 
Bonnie 
Halloran 

said the movement to form the 
organization was first based on 
the issues common to non-tenure 
track faculty nationwide — low 
pay and the lack of job security 
and proper benefits.

Before the LEO negotiated a

the experience of 

volunteering abroad

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Last month marked the 55th 

anniversary of former President 
John F. Kennedy’s speech on 
the steps of the Michigan Union 
proposing the organization of a 
United States Peace Corps.

Many things have changed 

since the program’s inception 
in 
1961, 
most 
notably 
the 

advancement 
of 
technology— 

which 
has 
had 
a 
profound 

influence on the application, 
deployment 
and 
service 

experience 
of 
Peace 
Corps 

volunteers 
in 
recent 
years, 

particularly among University 
participants.

Application process
In August 2012, the Peace 

Corps officially switched to an 

online application process that 
allows applicants to apply only 
to regions in which they have an 
interest. The previous system 
accepted only general applications 
— volunteer assignment locations 
were later determined based on 
each location’s varying level of 
need.

Jeanne Paul, who served as a 

Peace Corps volunteer in Brazil 
from 1964 to 1966, said because 
applicants can choose which 
regions they apply to, certain 
less desirable locations may no 
longer have enough volunteers. 
She said the Peace Corps changed 
their method of application to 
appeal to more applicants with a 
wider variety of experiences and 
qualifications.

“The irony here is that when 

you allow people to make these 
choices and to feel that they can 
determine where they’re going to 
go and what they’re going to do, 
you may be attracting people at 
the same time who won’t easily 
adjust to the communities where 
they’re serving,” Paul said.

Celebrations feature 

array of customs, 
expressions of faith

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 1,000 students 

and alumni gathered Friday at 
50 different locations across 
campus for a Shabbat dinner, 
which 
marks 
the 
Jewish 

Sabbath, or day of rest.

The event, called Shabbat at 

UM or ShabUM, was sponsored 
by 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Hillel and organized by a 
special committee.

LSA 
senior 
Ali 
Meisel, 

a member of the ShabUM 
committee, said Hillel hosted 
the event to celebrate all the 
different ways people observe 
Shabbat.

“When a Jewish person 

thinks of Shabbat, they think of 
the Friday night dinner and it’s 
a time where people can come 
together at the end of a week 
and really enjoy each other’s 
company and with their family 
and friends, and just really be 
grateful for the week that has 
just passed,” Meisel said.

Though Hillel hosts its own 

Shabbat dinner every Friday 
night, Meisel said, the point

State College, 28-16

STATE COLLEGE — As the 

public-address 
announcer’s 

voice echoed throughout Beaver 
Stadium, the No. 12 Michigan 
football team streamed onto the 
field for postgame handshakes 
with wide smiles and a sense of 
purpose.

The announcer listed stats 

from the game, but the players 
weren’t 
listening. 
The 
13 

penalties, two turnovers and 
countless miscues mattered as 
little as the four touchdowns and 
margin of victory.

The Wolverines (6-1 Big Ten, 

9-2 overall) had just defeated 
Penn State, 28-16, and all that

10 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (NOV. 23, 2005)

Graham institute launched

FUSION

Seven University schools 

collectively launched the 
Graham 
Environmental 

Sustainability Institute, an 
effort to address an energy 
crisis and reverse the effects 
of 
pollution 
and 
global 

warming.

This group is a compi-

lation of interdisciplinary 
environmental 
research 

programs from the schools 
of Natural Resources and 
Environment, Engineering, 
Public 
Health, 
Business, 

Architecture 
and 
Urban 

Planning, 
Public 
Policy 

and the College of Litera-
ture, Science and the Arts. 
The cooperation of these 
disciplines yields practical 

environmental projects and 
solutions.

Then-Associate 
Provost 

Phil Hanlon emphasized the 
program’s ability to provide 
assistance 
to 
companies 

looking to make efficient 
and environmentally friend-
ly products. He provided the 
example of a software com-
pany aiming to manufacture 
a fuel-efficient computer. 
With such a large collective 
skill set, the GESI would 
have 
the 
resources 
and 

information necessary to 
advise this company, he said.

32 years ago this week 

(Nov. 23, 1983)

University officials began 

looking into merit scholar-
ships to attract minority 
students to the school.

Opportunity 
Program 

Director 
Eunice 
Royster, 

now E. Royster Harper, the 
current vice president for 
student life, was confident in 
the approach. On the other 
hand, 
Salene 
Hitchcock, 

then-MSA vice president for 
minority affairs, the precur-
sor to Central Student Gov-
ernment, disagreed with the 
merit-based program. She 
said 
need-based 
scholar-

ships would be more appeal-
ing and beneficial to more 
students.

Urban planners contribute 
unique perspectives to council

All spectators will be 
asked to open their 
coats, outerwear for 

inspections

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

It might take a little longer 

to get through the line and into 
the Big House on Saturday as 
the University adds security 
measures for the upcoming 
football game against Ohio 
State.

Though the Division of Pub-

lic Safety and Security says 
there are no current specific 
threats, security officers will 
now ask each spectator to open 

their coat or outerwear for 
visual inspection for prohib-
ited items. Law enforcement 
may also pat down fans or ask 
them to empty their pockets 
for further inspection. People 
who refuse the checks will be 
denied entry.

The list of prohibited items, 

which has already been in 
place, includes bags, drones, 
selfie sticks, weapons, bottles 
and umbrellas. This list will be 
strictly enforced. Exceptions 
for medical needs may be per-
mitted, but supplies must be in 
a clear bag.

When asked whether the 

precautions are being enacted 
in response to recent terrorist 
attacks targeting public spaces 
in Paris and elsewhere, DPSS 
spokesperson 
Diane 
Brown 

declined to provide additional 
comment. She said more infor-
mation may be available at an 
athletics media briefing on 
Monday. 

Joe Piersante, director of 

University Security Services 
with DPSS said the depart-
ment often adjusts security 
protocols depending on the 
situation.

“We want this to be a safe 

environment for our patrons 
and area neighbors,” he wrote. 
“We regularly analyze our 
security plans and make modi-
fications as necessary.”

With a capacity of 107,601, 

Michigan Stadium has the 
highest spectator capacity of 
any football stadium in the 
United States.

Kirk Westphal, 

Chip Smith draw on 
knowledge of city 

landscapes 

By EMILY ROBERTS

Daily Staff Reporter

With City Council’s two new 

members installed last month, 
the addition of one of them also 
doubles the total number of coun-
cil members with a background in 
professional city planning.

Councilmember Chip Smith 

(D–Ward 5) joins Kirk Westphal 
(D–Ward 2) as the second a coun-
cil member with an urban plan-
ner’s background.

As urban planners and coun-

cil members, they both said they 
aspire to proactively shape Ann 
Arbor into an accessible and 
affordable place to live.

“It is really important for us as 

a community to decide what we 

want to be when we grow up, to 
put it simply,” Smith said.

Smith, who is a professional 

urban planner certified by the 
American Institute of Certified 
Planners, currently works for 
Wade Trim in Detroit, a design 
and civil engineering firm. West-
phal, who holds a masters in urban 
planning from the University, is 
the owner of Westphal Associates, 
a firm focused on aiding business-
es with research and advertising.

Westphal said he’s found him-

self using his degree in urban 
planning in a unique way as a 
member of the council, recalling 
a time in his graduate program 
when a professor asked whether 
one had to be a professional plan-
ner to do city planning.

The answer to this question, for 

Westphal, was no.

“Some people do (city planning) 

through journalism, some people 
do it through teaching, some peo-
ple go onto transportation, some 
people environmental studies,” he 

said. “The thing that wasn’t men-
tioned but what I found myself in 
was getting involved with local 
politics.”

Urban planners, Smith said, are 

able to bring “big picture” think-
ing to the body, which is impor-
tant in thinking about topics like 
city development, a frequent 
discussion point among council 
members.

“The more people on Council 

that understand the intricacies of 
development, the better that we 
can address the growth and devel-
opment issues,” he said.

For Westphal, his desire to be 

an urban planner came first, and 
his City Council aspirations sec-
ond, but he said he’s found they 
both work together well.

“Cities and neighborhoods and 

transportation had always fas-
cinated me, and I thought that 
urban planning would really help 
me scratch that itch,” Westphal 
said. “I never intended to be an 
elected official but I saw how my 
background in urban planning 
could help inform council discus-
sions for the city as a whole.”

Smith echoed Westphal, saying 

his background has helped him 
understand the consequences and 
benefits of development.

“(Urban planners) have a keen-

er understanding of the devel-
opment process and how that 
process impacts the environment; 
the human environment and the 
natural environment,” he said.

For both, they said, when it 

came to policy, creating affordable 
housing and transit were develop-
ment priorities for them.

“Expanding 
opportunities 

for anybody, whether they’re 
students or not to be able to live 
here more affordably, will take 
a lot of political courage and 
acknowledging that we are will-
ing to change the appearance of 
parts of the city to accommodate 
more people,” he said. “And this 
is difficult to do. We’ve invested 
a lot more in transit and it’s the 
perfect opportunity to allow 
people to live in a way that’s less 
reliant on cars.”

FUTU RE PALEONTOLOGIST


of ShabUM was to foster a 
comfortable space for those who 
may not feel comfortable going 
to a Hillel dinner.

“We know that’s not for 

everybody and not everybody 
wants 
to 
come 
to 
Hillel,” 

she said. “This event is an 
opportunity, as the slogan says, 
to ‘bring Shabbat home,’ which 
means that different people 
with particular interests are 
able to have their own personal 
Shabbat dinners.”

The 
ShabUM 
committee 

supplied each Shabbat host with 
a goodie bag that included the 
weekly Torah portion, matches 
with “Michigan” written in 
Hebrew on the box and a cloth 
cover for challah, a type of 
Jewish egg bread, also inscribed 
with 
Michigan 
in 
Hebrew. 

Hosts were welcome to use any 

or all of the items, which are 
included in traditional Shabbat 
dinners.

Meisel said the event meant 

a lot to her because of the 
significance Shabbat has for her 
personally.

“Judaism is a really big part 

of my identity and I’ve always 
loved Shabbat dinners,” she 
said. “Even though the general, 
basic 
aspects 
of 
Shabbat 

dinners can be the same, if that 
means eating challah, one of the 
ritual breads, or if it’s lighting 
candles, 
the 
experience 
is 

different no matter where you 
are. I’m really excited that I 
get to facilitate other people 
having their unique individual 
Shabbat experiences, especially 
for people who don’t usually 
celebrate it at all.”

LSA senior Gabi Kirsch, 

co-president 
of 
Ahava, 
an 

LGBTQ student organization 
that is part of Hillel, hosted a 
Shabbat dinner that aimed to be 
inclusive of queer individuals.

“The actual name of the 

event, actually, is One Fish, 
Two Fish, Queer Fish, Jew 
Fish,” she said.

Kirsch said she thought it 

was important to give Jews a 
queer space on campus that 
isn’t necessarily in a straight or 
heteronormative 
perspective, 

such as for traditional events 
like Shabbat.

“It’s important to have a 

queer space in general, just 
because I think a lot time queer 
Jews have to sort of self-censor,” 
she said. “Either they’re in a 
queer space and they have to 
censor being Jewish, because 
it’s not so typical, or they’re in 
a Jewish space and they have 
to censor being queer. It gets 
really tiring and exhausting 
having to censor like that and 
always being aware of how 
you’re coming off.”

Noting 
the 
integral 
role 

Shabbat plays for many Jews 
growing up, Kirsch said she 
felt that significance made it 

especially important to host a 
specifically LGBTQ dinner.

“It’s not that everyone is 

having a conversation about 
being queer out there,” she 
said. “The goal is that they can 
have it and not feel like they’re 
the only one in the room who’s 
feeling that way or have had 
those experiences.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Sara 

Bender-Bier spent the most of 
her Friday cooking to get ready 
for her dinner, which mostly 
included freshmen. People in 
her apartment, she said, had 
always been eager to host Hillel 
events, which is why they 
decided to host Shabbat dinner.

“We like cooking and we 

really like the idea of having 
a bunch of people over for 
Shabbat and making it more of a 
homey feel,” she said. “At Hillel, 
you have so many people there, 
sometimes it can be really 
overwhelming even though it’s 
a really great community, but 
when you’re here in a home, it 

feels more comfortable.”

Bender-Bier said her dinner 

didn’t include any religious 
services 
before 
it 
started 

because she wanted to make 
her guests feel as comfortable 
as possible.

“There are some people that 

don’t feel comfortable going to 
Hillel because they don’t feel 
that observant, that religious,” 
she said. “We didn’t have any 
rituals beforehand, we just 
have the prayers and if you want 
to go to the services at Hillel 
before you can, but there’s no 
pressure to do anything super 
religious.”

Overall, she said she hoped 

that by coming to ShabUM, 
her guests could form new 
friendships 
and 
explore 

Judaism more.

“There are so many ways to 

be Jewish and not a lot of people 
realize that there’s more than 
one way,” she said. “Hopefully 
this makes them feel more 
comfortable.”

Paul is the founder and 

administrator of the Southeast 
Michigan Returned Peace Corps 
Volunteer Applicant-Mentoring 
Program, 
a 
program 
which 

matches 
former 
volunteers 

with students and community 
members 
interested 
in 

applying. The program works 
in conjunction with the School 
of Information and the Peace 
Corps.

Rackham student Benjamin 

Morse, a former Peace Corps 
volunteer and strategic campus 
recruiter for the corps, served in 
Hawzen, Ethiopia from 2011 to 
2013.

In addition to being able to 

apply to specific regions, Morse 
said 
the 
online 
application 

process 
has 
also 
allowed 

volunteers 
to 
gain 
more 

information about where they’re 
going before they leave. When he 
was deployed, prior to the online 
application, he said he had no 
information until right before he 
departed.

“It was this elusive process 

where you never really knew 
where you were going until right 
at the end,” Morse said.

Because he could not, at that 

time, apply to any particular 
region, after being admitted, 
Morse was nominated by the 
corps for a specific region. 
Morse was asked to serve in 
sub-Saharan Africa, and told 
he would depart that October. 
Morse said he was not permitted 
to know what country he was 
going to until 10 days after he 
was told his region.

Technology 
access 
during 

service

University 
alum 
Rachel 

Bielajew 
currently 
serves 

as a math education Peace 
Corps 
volunteer 
in 
Malawi 

and will complete her service 
in September 2017. Rackham 
student Megan Barnes served 
as a Peace Corps volunteer in 
Guatemala.

Though 
technological 

advancement is seen as vital 
in the Western world, both 
Barnes and Bielajew said they 
found little use for advanced 
technology in the field.

Bielajew 
said 
her 
work 

teaching math largely lacks 
technological tools.

“In my work as a teacher I 

use very little (technology),” 
Bielajew said. “Day to day, it’s 
just a chalkboard, chalk and 
me.”

Bielajew said her school is 

currently 
trying 
to 
acquire 

a computer, despite limited 
funds. She brought her laptop 
to Malawi and is using it to 
teach her fellow teachers and 
community members how to 
use a computer, or to show films 
to her students to help them 
practice English.

In contrast, Barnes said she 

remembered visiting a remote 
community with no electricity 
that had been gifted a complete 
solar-powered computer lab. 
She said the gift went largely 
unused.

“It was reputed that no 

one knew how to use or fix 
the computers so they went 
unused,” Barnes said. “I thought 
a thing like that would be nice 
for my community, but saw the 
sustainability challenges with 
installing a ‘gifted’ technology 
suite’that would then be left to 
gather dust.”

Charging a cell phone is 

quite a feat in the Peace Corps. 
Using car batteries to charge 
phones or traveling to a city to 
sit in a coffee shop are the norm 
for many volunteers who are 
seeking electricity. Paul said 
she’s had return volunteers tell 
her they have to walk to the 
highest elevation in the area to 
find cell phone reception, even if 
that spot is hours away. Even so, 
she said, every volunteer brings a 
cell phone.

Though technology is not 

largely 
used 
for 
teaching 

purposes, 
both 
Barnes 
and 

Bielajew brought cell phones to 
their countries of deployment, 
and 
used 
them 
regularly. 

Bielajew said she was one of few 
community members to have a 
smartphone. 

“I use my smartphone all the 

time for personal reasons, like 
talking with other volunteers 
and 
friends 
back 
at 
home 

through WhatsApp,” Bielajew 
said. “Many of the members 
of my community have a cell 
phone, but only a few of the 
more well-off people have a 
smartphone.”

Barnes said she was unsure 

of what to expect of the 
technology in Guatemala, and 
she heard mixed accounts of cell 
phone access and the presence 
of Internet cafes. She said as 
unpredictable as it was, media 
access provided her comfort 
during her service.

“I use Facebook occasionally 

to update friends and family 
back home and try to share 
with them some of what I’m 
learning about the culture of 
Malawi,” Bielajew said. “ I don’t 
remember the last time I read 
or watched the news because it 
just takes too long to load on my 
phone.”

Reintegration into society
It can be difficult for Peace 

Corps volunteers to reintegrate 
into society upon return.

Paul said a smooth integration 

to a new society is influenced 
by the volunteers’ expectations. 
Negative expectations can make 
reintegration difficult for those 
returning. She said volunteers 
return with one foot in the 
culture of the host community 
and another foot in their native 
culture, which can be difficult to 
reconcile.

“They expect culture shock 

when they go, they don’t expect 
culture shock when they come 
back and it’s very painful to 
discover most Americans are not 
interested in what they learned,” 
Paul said. “And when they come 
back 
they’re 
very 
different 

people.”

When Paul returned, the 

landscape of American culture 
had gone through an upheaval 
during her 27 months in Brazil.

“Women were ironing their 

hair on an ironing board, women 
were all wearing miniskirts, 
there was mass murder in this 
country for the first time and 
there was inflation — a term 
we’d never heard before,” Paul 
said.

For Barnes, the reintegration 

period was not as difficult, largely 
due to access to technology, 
which Paul did not have during 
his service. Due to access to 
communication mediums like 
e-mail and Facebook, Barnes 
said, it did not feel as though the 
world had moved on without her.

“I was a little behind the times 

as far as popular culture and 
music went,” Barnes said. “But 
I had at least heard of ‘Game of 
Thrones’ — even if I didn’t know 
what it was.”

contract with the University, 
Halloran, who is also a lecturer, 
said she was not a full-time 
employee 
and 
made 
only 

$19,700. After the contract, she 
said, she saw a 43-percent raise 
in pay.

“This is the kind of thing that 

galvanized people to form a 
union,” Halloran said. “The pay 
rates were so low that they were 
basically poverty wages.”

At 
the 
time 
when 

negotiations began, Halloran 
said, the University recognized 
the problem that existed in the 
community.

“The University was willing 

to work with the unions. They 
did not start from the point that 
unions are hostile,” she said. 
“They knew that what we were 
asking for was reasonable and a 
public embarrassment.”

Jeffery Frumkin, associate 

vice provost for academic and 
faculty affairs and director of 
academic 
human 
resources, 

expressed similar sentiments.

“There are other institutions 

who took a pretty hard stance 
when their lecturers organized, 
but for the leaders of this 
institution that was never really 
on the table,” Frumkin said. 
“My sense was there’s a reason 
that they wanted to unionize, 
and there were treatments 
of people that had go one for 
time and time without being 
reviewed.”

In terms of relations between 

the LEO and the University, 
Halloran said the negotiations 
have yielded positive results 
and 
that 
adjuncts 
at 
the 

University have one of the best 
contracts in the country.

However, she and other 

lecturers noted that despite the 
strides made in the last 10 years, 
issues still remain.

In particular, Halloran said, 

lecturers are still underpaid 
for the skills they bring to their 
jobs.

“These 
are 
people 
with 

advanced degrees and this is 
the type of pay they get,” she 

said. “We are teaching these 
really key classes that are all 
essential parts of the students’ 
education, and the people who 
are teaching them are well 
trained but poorly paid.”

Melinda Matice, a lecturer in 

the English Language Institute, 
echoed Halloran’s statement, 
pointing to the impacts of 
lecturers 
on 
defraying 
the 

University’s costs.

“As universities have become 

more expensive I think it is 
important to add that the 
amount 
of 
teaching 
that 

lecturers do really helps keep 
the costs down,” she said. “I 
think it would be fair to inquire 
why costs continue to rise when 
our pay isn’t rising accordingly, 
that rise is not reflected in 
the people who are doing the 
majority of the teaching.”

Frumkin said the University 

has done a lot to meet the needs 
of the union, but understands 
that there is more the union 
wants to address.

“I think the first contract 

went a long way to meeting 
the objectives of the union,” 
Frumkin said. “It’s still not 
everything they want, but that 
is OK because that is what 
unions do.”

Alexandra Matish, associate 

director of academic human 
resources at the University, 
said the University has a solid 
working 
relationship 
with 

the LEO, but they still have 
disagreements.

“We 
have 
a 
very 
good 

working 
relationship 
with 

them,” Matish said. “We don’t 
always agree but we have a very 
good working relationship. I 
would be surprised if they were 
pleased with it, but that is part 
of the job of a union to continue 
to advocate for their members.”

Speaking to wages, which 

is what both sides identified 
as 
the 
largest 
point 
of 

contention, Halloran said lack 
of prioritization is the reason 
lecturer pay isn’t higher.

“The University could set 

different kinds of priorities,” 
Halloran 
said. 
“They 

could put more money into 
undergraduate education and 

pay their lecturers a fair salary 
for what they are doing.”

Frumkin 
disagreed 
with 

Halloran’s 
assessment 
of 

the situation and cited the 
decentralized 
nature 
of 

budgets instead as the reason 
for variation in salaries across 
different disciplines.

“The 
dean 
has 
the 

responsibility 
for 
managing 

his or her resources,” Frumkin 
said. “We have a wide range of 
salaries on campus, but that is 
not unique to the lecturers. The 
salary ranges for tenure-track 
faculty vary all over the place.”

Overall, both sides said they 

agree that the University has 
done a lot to compromise with 
the unions, but disagreements 
on issues like wages still exist 
between the two groups.

Judy Dyer, lecturer in the 

English Language Institute, 
said while she still thinks 
pay is still too low, she is 
grateful for what the union has 
accomplished.

“Salaries are pitifully low,” 

she said. “However, I would 
hate to work in a university 
as a lecturer without a union 
because all of the things we got, 
we got together.”

Frumkin 
said 
he 
had 

heard 
about 
the 
types 
of 

poor relationships that many 
universities have with their 
non-tenure track faculty and 
feels the one at the University is 
above the standard.

“We are so far removed from 

that now, but that doesn’t mean 
everything is perfect,” he said. 
“From an overall standpoint, 
looking at what has been 
accomplished by LEO and the 
University in the three areas of 
salary, benefits, and job security, 
it’s a very different kind of 
supportive 
and 
protective 

relationship in comparison to 
other institutions.”

Halloran said she is proud 

to work for the University, but 
still hopes for improvement, 
especially in regard to wages.

“It’s a good place to work, but 

it doesn’t mean it’s perfect,” she 
said. “It’s not as embarrassing 
now as it used to be, but it is still 
really low pay.”

‘U’ takes American 
Campuses Act on 
Climate Pledge

The 
University, 
along 

with more than 200 other 
colleges, 
has 
signed 
the 

American Campuses Act on 
Climate pledge, according to a 
University press release. The 
pledge supports world leaders 
taking strong actions against 
climate change.

The 
list 
of 
supporters 

was released by the White 
House Office of Science and 
Technology last Thursday, and 
a group of 10 faculty members 
and students will be attending 
the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference in Paris 
beginning Nov. 30 as part of the 
pledge.

Participants 
in 
the 
U.N. 

conference will be from the 
School 
of 
Information, 
the 

School of Natural Resources 
and Environment, the College 
of Engineering and the Public 
Policy School. 
Ann Arbor receives 
record-hitting 10.7 
inches of snow 

Snowfall 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 

hit an all-time record for a 
24-hour period in the month 
of November, with almost a 
foot of snow accumulating 
across the city on Saturday.

The 
first 
records 
date 

back 
to 
1880. 
Saturday’s 

snow totaled 10.7 inches on 
the 
University’s 
campus, 

according 
to 
the 
National 

Weather Service.

Snowfall 
tallies 
varied 

across 
the 
county. 
Some 

parts of town received less, 
like 
southeast 
Ann 
Arbor, 

where 9.6 inches of snow was 
recorded. 
In 
Manchester, 

in the southwest corner of 
Washtenaw 
County, 
more 

than 14 inches of snow fell 
Saturday.

According 
to 
Dennis 

Kahlbaum, the University’s 
staff 
meteorologist, 
this 

variance was due to a dry 
pocket in the weather system 
that formed during the storm, 
causing the county’s northern 
and western parts experienced 
more snow than other areas.

Even though Ann Arbor saw 

a record for a 24-hour period, 
the overall snowfall was not 
the biggest in the state. Howell. 
recorded 16.5 inches of snow as 
of 8:45 a.m. Saturday.

mattered now was Ohio State.

Michigan overcame a slew of 

untimely penalties, a poor run 
game and a hostile Penn State 
crowd to not only win, but also 
keep its Big Ten Championship 
hopes alive.

“It was a great win,” said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“The amount of players that 
contributed to this win was 
very higher — probably our 
highest total of the season. … 
There was a lot of guys sucking 
it up and playing good, winning 
football.”

Much of that good, winning 

football came from fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock. 
After compiling 777 yards and 
eight touchdowns in the last 
two weeks, Rudock was back at 
it against the Nittany Lions (4-3, 
7-4) on Saturday.

In a back-and-forth game, the 

reigning Big Ten Co-Offensive 
Player of the Week threw for 
256 yards and two touchdowns 
on 25-for-38 passing. Both of his 
touchdowns came immediately 
after the defense allowed a 
score.

After the Nittany Lions scored 

a field goal on the opening drive, 
Rudock found junior tight end 
Jake Butt for a touchdown on 
the ensuing possession. Later, 
when Penn State took a 10-7 
lead with a touchdown, Rudock 
connected with redshirt junior 
wide receiver Amara Darboh for 
an 11-yard score to close the first 
half.

“Just finding a way,” Rudock 

said. 
“Scratching, 
itching, 

clawing, whatever you have to 
do to get points on the board. It’s 
what we have to do.”

With 
the 
performance, 

Rudock 
became 
the 
first 

quarterback in Michigan history 
to throw for 250 yards or more 
in three consecutive weeks.

As in recent games, the run 

game continued to struggle 
for the Wolverines. Five backs 
combined for just 87 yards on 30 
carries, but senior fullback Sione 
Houma found the end zone after 
the Nittany Lions fumbled a 
punt, setting Michigan up for an 
easy score.

And 
with 
just 
over 
five 

minutes to go in the game and 
Penn State trailing just 21-16, 
junior running back De’Veon 
Smith scored from two yards out 
to provide the dagger Michigan 
needed.

Before that dagger came, the 

Wolverines’ defense continued 
to exhibit the big-play woes 
that have plagued it all month. 
Penn 
State 
running 
back 

Saquon Barkley broke loose for 
a 56-yard run on the game’s 
opening drive to set up a field 
goal, and quarterback Christian 
Hackenberg 
found 
receiver 

Saeed Blacknall for a 25-yard 
touchdown in the first half’s 
waning moments.

Michigan’s defense buckled 

down 
in 
the 
second 
half, 

however, ending the game with 
10 tackles for loss and just 207 
yards — including just 74 in the 
second half — allowed on 54 
plays. In four trips to the red 
zone, Penn State mustered just 
nine points.

“It’s been remarkable the 

way our defense is playing, 
and I can’t imagine anyone’s 
playing any better,” Harbaugh 
said. “The amount of guys that 
stepped up was really a lot. … 
I’m really trying to single one 
guy out, but I can’t.”

With each defensive stop and 

ensuing score, the Wolverines 
quieted the crowd of 107,418 in 
Beaver Stadium. As the players 
left the field, the hundreds 
of Michigan fans that made 
the trip remained and began 
chanting “Beat Ohio.”

Michigan had conquered its 

latest opponent, and was on to 
the next week.

“Whenever 
you 
win 
a 

road game, you’re not just 
overcoming the other team, 
you’re overcoming the other 
team’s fans,” Harbaugh said. 
“That really makes you feel like 
a man when you do that.”

Despite 
the 
win, 
the 

Wolverines’ hopes of winning 
the Big Ten East took a hit 
on Saturday when, later in 
the 
afternoon, 
Michigan 

State defeated Ohio State in 
Columbus. Michigan’s path to 
the Big Ten Championship Game 
now hinges on not only a win 
over Buckeyes, but also Penn 
State upsetting the Spartans in 
East Lansing.

However, after a long and 

hectic season, the Wolverines 
can tune out the noise and focus 
solely on Ohio State. With wide 
smiles and a sense of purpose, 
Michigan’s dreams are still 
alive.

“It’s 
fun 
to 
be 
in 
this 

environment and this position,” 
Harbaugh said. “It’s fun to be in 
the playoffs. In our minds, we’ve 
been in it for weeks.

“We’re right where we want 

to be, and we’re playing for the 
championship.”

Misguided empathy for Paris

O

n Nov. 13, Paris was hit by a 
series of terrorists attacks. 
By the night’s end, a barrage 

of shooting and 
suicide bombings 
left 
about 
130 

people dead and 
hundreds 
more 

injured. This was 
the most deadly 
attack France has 
faced since World 
War II.

The 
reaction 

from the tragedy 
naturally sparked 
widespread fear 
across the globe, 
particularly in Western countries. 
Collectively, the public’s heightened 
fear has initiated a call for imme-
diate security from our national 
governments. Although this is a nat-
ural human reaction, the response is 
socially and politically misguided.

Emotionally speaking, our fear of 

terrorism is warranted. After wit-
nessing terrorist activity in Paris (in 
addition to that in Beirut and Mali), 
people became increasingly intimi-
dated. They should be.

Since technological advancements 

have spread to more people with no 
official (or elected) power, the capac-
ity of an individual or small group of 
people to cause extensive destruc-
tion has become a growing concern. 
As Moises Naim argues in “The End 
of Power,” technological develop-
ments over the past few decades have 
allowed for the widespread disper-
sion of information and more com-
plex social groupings. The result has 
led to more power concentrated in 
the hands of fewer, thereby dimin-
ishing the influence of our elected 
officials and institutions. Typically, 
this power is positively utilized, 
improving education levels and indi-
vidual autonomy. However, in the 
wrong hands, increased power can 
be devastating.

The increased capacity for wide-

spread destruction by a small num-
ber of organized deviants increases 
the threat of terrorism. Consequent-
ly, watching this destruction unfold 
makes our lives appear more precari-
ous and therefore more precious. As 
we are exposed to traumatic series of 
human suffering through innumer-
able media channels, we, in turn, feel 
pressing sadness, despair and fear in 
our hearts and minds, as if the attack 
had occurred to us.

Initially, people’s fear from these 

lethal attacks expose humanity’s 
most beautiful trait: empathy. When 
we connect emotionally with others 
in harm’s way, we often offer chari-
table and emotional support. Expres-
sion of empathy allows us to care for 
people we’d otherwise be unconnect-
ed with, living halfway around the 
world. Unfortunately, empathy, in 
the background of intense terrorism, 
leads to fear, as we personally imag-
ine confrontation with terrorism. 
And while fear alone is manageable, 
when it drives our political and social 
decisions, it’s problematic. In Ameri-
ca’s recent history, we’ve entertained 
a path driven by fear. The results 
have been tragic.

After the planes hit the World 

Trade Center in 2001, the natural 
human reactions of empathy, sad-
ness, despair and fear brewed in 
America. Ultimately, these feel-
ings galvanized a sense of need for 
national security, leading to two 
wars, and the creation of Guanta-
namo Bay (along with torture-ridden 
black sites). In the former, we were 
left with mounting human fatality 
and trillions of dollars wasted. In the 
latter, according to scholar Joseph 
Margulies, many innocent people 
were abused without due process 
under the law. What’s more, our fears 
of terrorism have likely endured 14 
years after 9/11, as President Barack 
Obama has been unable to remove all 
American troops from Afghanistan 
and is continuously rebuffed when 
he attempts to close Gitmo. 

As noted, our fear-driven behavior 

and decisions in light of harrowing 
terrorist attacks are not completely 
uncalled for; they are a natural reac-
tion to human suffering. In turn, we 
search for security. Our fear-driven 
response galvanizes us to ensure 
America’s safety, liberty and democ-
racy. On the surface, this appears 
good. We want to shield Americans 
from unjust harm. However, our 
push for safety becomes problematic 
when we infringe on the liberty and 
security of foreigners, in addition to 
American citizens.

Our priority for safety is made 

in light of terrorism’s challenge — 
offering us a choice between safety 
and liberty. The more personal lib-
erty we maintain, the more at risk 
we are of terrorist acts. This initiates 
a controversial debate — should we 
abrogate our values and personal lib-
erty for the sake of security? Should 
we do everything in our power to 
keep American citizens safe, even if 
that means invasive National Secu-
rity Agency techniques and locking 
people away without due process? 
In response to terrorism, our initial 
instincts have led us to choose the 
former; we have done everything 
possible to keep American citizens 
safe even while disregarding the 
rights of individuals. However, in 
times of fear and uncertainty, maybe 
it would be more helpful to reconsid-
er how we view terrorism.

Maybe, as David Foster Wallace 

suggests, we should consider those 
who die at the hands of terrorists to 
be martyrs, who’ve sacrificed their 
lives for freedom, liberty and democ-
racy. In reality, the alternative seems 
much worse. The late author ven-
tured down this path when he asked 
if Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, the 
PATRIOT Acts, warrantless sur-
veillance, etc. are worth protecting 
Americans’ safety? And let’s be hon-
est, when these institutions claim to 
protect “Americans’ ” safety, they’re 
really excluding Muslim Americans 
or any person one could associate 
with the Middle East. 

Today, the attacks in Paris — strik-

ing fear into the general public — have 
occurred in the midst of a critical for-
eign policy issue: the Syrian refugee 
crises. Many American governors 
have made a choice: increase security 
and refuse to accept Syrian refugees, 

presumably because they believe 
Muslims to be the root cause of ter-
rorism. Again, misguided fear has 
become an immediate social problem 
in today’s political climate. Again, 
America is on a track that actively and 
passively abuses the rights of others. 
Unfortunately, terrorism — the cause 
of our fear and vulnerability — justi-
fies these actions to the public, allow-
ing our representatives to make very 
poor, prejudicial decisions. Ultimate-
ly, representatives overlook the cause 
of terrorism: the lack of autonomy, 
agency and political rights terror-
ists feel, leading them to cause great 
harm to others. Our reaction does 
more than propagate Islamophobia. 
Our reaction destroys the possibility 
for resolve, the end to terrorism and 
relief for its victims.

Our prejudice won’t help us under-

stand why these people do what they 
do — what is influencing people to 
want to cause mass destruction. 
After all, terrorists are humans even 
if they act inhumanely. Therefore, 
they are driven by the same human 
instincts as the rest of us. If we begin 
assessing them as such, we can fairly 
and objectively question what they 
do and why they do it. Instead, we 
consider persons who allegedly con-
duct acts of terrorism to be inhu-
man, and dismiss them of their full 
rights under the law. Unfortunately, 
infringing on terrorists’ civil liber-
ties will not get America any closer to 
eradicating terrorism.

Of course, having read this far 

(and probably declaring me a tree-
hugging liberal hippie), you may be 
asking, what about your life? Are you 
not afraid of putting your life in jeop-
ardy of a massacre? And, further-
more, what about the families that 
are randomly taken, the lives lost? 
Should we not do everything possible 
to bring these victims restitution?

From my view, infringing on the 

rights of others is not the proper way 
for victims and their families to heal 
from terrorism. Sacrificing my per-
sonal values — liberty, justice, due 
process under the law for all global 
citizens — is worth my life. The alter-
native — persecuting others due to 
excessive fear and prejudice — is 
much worse.

Today, our political, domestic and 

international systems ensure that 
we don’t arbitrarily destroy a human 
life or strip it of all its value, even 
if that human life has committed 
deplorable crimes. In other words, 
our nations have made themselves 
responsible for protecting individu-
als by laws and processes that place 
value on human lives. Personally, I 
don’t want to live in a place where 
my government stops deeming all 
people as humans, unworthy of min-
imum respect and dignity. Warring 
(relatively) arbitrarily with nations 
and indiscriminately sorting people 
in institutions like “black sites” and 
Guantanamo Bay epitomizes this 
place. There’s much more terror I feel 
from that prospect than anything 
an extremist with a weapon can do 
 

to me.

My heart hurts too

My heart aches. For Lebanon. France. 

Nigeria. Syria. For both the reported 
and unreported deaths and injuries. For 
every wound made in this world from the 
 

incessant violence.

My heart aches. For the brown people who 

may have been safe from those attacks, but 
aren’t safe from the public’s.

I can’t hide that I’m Muslim, so whenever 

an act of terror happens, I can’t mourn in 
peace. I’m stuck in a glass room in which 
all eyes are on me. Even when I’m angry, 
sad and frustrated — having the same feel-
ings you have — I have no space for it in my 
 

glass box.

And when I’m finally able to grasp my 

arms around my emotions and reactions, 
you start to ask.

When you ask me to be “brave” when 

everyone else is encouraged to fear me, you 
are asking for a piece of me. When you ask 
me to apologize for what happened, you are 
asking for a piece of me. When you ask me to 
condemn what happens, you are asking for 
a piece of me. And even as you simply ask, I 
find myself unraveling as you move to collect 
 

the pieces.

Islamophobia is not my paranoia.
Islamophobia is hijabi women being 

denied entry into a store, brown fami-
lies asked to step off of flights for making 
the staff uncomfortable, governors of 31 
states announcing their unwillingness to 
accept Syrian refugees, arson attacks on 
masjids, Muslim and non-Muslim brown 
persons fearing for their lives while 
walking on the street, death threats and 
not being allowed to call your country 
 

your home.

Islamophobia is not me being over-emo-

tional, or self-victimizing or me exaggerating.

Islamophobia is me — having a man I’ve 

never met grab me on the street so that I’m 
forced to listen to him. Islamophobia is me 
— being verbally harassed on the street for 
wearing hijab. Islamophobia is me — ner-

vous for my brown dad traveling on an inter-
national flight in two days. Islamophobia is 
me — always thinking about how much eas-
ier it would be if I took off my hijab. Islamo-
phobia is me — realizing that even if I did, I 
would still be unsafe.

It’s strange to have your beliefs plastered in 

flashy headlines, 140 characters and disturb-
ing images. Religion has always been some-
thing very personal to me, and I never would 
have thought that I would have to defend and 
answer for it so often. Islam was taught to me 
by my parents and community to prioritize 
good character, honesty and humility. And 
when I’m asked to explain myself and my reli-
gion for its “violent,” “barbaric,” “oppressive” 
beliefs, I can’t answer you. Because you aren’t 
talking about my religion.

You’re talking about a group of individu-

als who make up a miniscule percentage 
of those who identify as Muslim. If you are 
going to paint a whole race, region or religion 
with your label of “terrorist,” then you better 
have done your research. And if you did do 
your research, you would realize that you’ve 
made a minority your majority, and that you 
are mistaken. In fact, by far, more Muslims 
have died at the hands of ISIS than any other 
group. ISIS, and other terrorist organiza-
tions, are exactly that — organizations that 
are focused on building political power. They 
are corrupt people who use the pretense of 
religion to achieve their goals.

And that means I will mourn — for the 

hundreds of black and brown people who 
don’t have the benefit of your doubt, whose 
lives do not matter when white lives are lost, 
who are forced out of their homes, who are 
painted in broad strokes and who escape one 
terror only to be attacked with another.

So this is me asking you to stop with the 

Islamophobia and xenophobia. Stop using me 
as your target practice for your frustration. 
Because my heart hurts, too.

FROM THE DAILY

Indigenous Peoples Day

The University should recognize newly created holiday
T

he Ann Arbor City Council voted unanimously on Nov. 16 
to designate the second Monday of October as Indigenous 
Peoples Day. A couple of days later, the Washtenaw County 

Board of Commissioners followed suit at the request of commissioner 
Yousef Rabhi. The new holiday, meant to replace Columbus Day, was 
the result of collaboration between Councilmember Chuck Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 5) and various local indigenous groups and their allies. The 
decree is obviously a welcome change, as Columbus Day has been a 
topic of controversy, and shows much-warranted consideration of 
native communities here in the Ann Arbor area. However, the county’s 
recognition of the holiday is somewhat diminished by the University’s 
questionable history with its Native American constituents. Now that 
progress is the law of the land, the University should follow suit by 
recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day and set the tone for a new era of 
alliance with those community members who deserve our respect.

The University was founded (both in its 

original location in Detroit and its current 
location in Ann Arbor) on what was once 
Native American land with the permission of 
the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs. But in the years 
following its conception, the school has done 
little to honor this grant.

Additionally, 
students 
showed 
their 

prejudiced attitudes toward Native Americans 
in tasteless club traditions like those of the 
Order of Angell — a University organization 
(which changed its name from the pseudo-
tribal “Michigamua” in 2006) with a long, 
murky past rooted in blatant insensitivity. 
In its heyday, the formerly secret society 
initiated its members with public rituals 
involving sacred Native American regalia and 
religious items, such as peace pipes, drums 
and totems. Acts such as these were called out 
as unacceptable by not only the indigenous 
community in Ann Arbor, but also various 
organizations on campus. Having undergone 
so much intense scrutiny, the Order fully 
ceased these despicable activities by 1989.

Further, 
University 
possession 
of 

Native American artifacts has also been a 
point of contention in the past. In March 
2008, members of the Saginaw Chippewa 
tribe requested rights to what Museum 
of Anthropological Archaeology officials 
deemed 
“unidentifiable” 
artifacts, 
but 

because ownership of ambiguously cultured 
objects was not ruled illegal by the Native 

American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act of 1990, their efforts were futile. It was 
not until two years later in 2010 that the 
federal court became involved and demanded 
the University return the remains to their 
rightful place.

With 
these 
instances 
in 
mind, 
the 

University should take full advantage of 
this opportunity to make amends with its 
neighbors. A good start would be to eradicate 
the recognition of Columbus Day from 
University calendars and planners; an even 
better effort would be to recognize local 
tribes like those of the Three Fires — Ojibwe, 
Odawa and Potawatami — by hosting a day or 
more of events in collaboration with them.

The University of California, Berkeley, 

for example, holds a day-long festival that 
features an exhibition and gourd dancing, as 
well as an “Indian market” with handmade 
products from local tribes. Simply bringing 
in native speakers to share their experiences 
with the student body would also be a step in 
the right direction.

The Native American community in Ann 

Arbor is essential to the history of both the 
city and the University. Recognition of their 
influence is commendable, but deliberate 
effort by the University to acknowledge and 
appreciate them is warranted if we are to 
celebrate this new holiday with integrity. 
Given our disreputable history, it is the least 
we can do.

Odesza not stopping 
rise anytime soon

CONCERT REVIEW

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

With some people in full fairy 

costume, with light-up capes, 
glowing sunglasses and multi-
colored luminescent balloons 
floating through the crowd, most 
were there to rave, emphatically 
bouncing with every vibration of 
the ubiquitous bass.

Odesza, made up of Harrison 

Mills (previously CatacombKid) 
and Clayton Knight (Beaches-
Beaches), has only been playing 
together since 2012. Yet there we 
were Friday night at the Detroit 
Masonic Temple in a jam-
packed, sold-out theater where 
every person knew every song. 
The show was insane — a sonic, 
visual and tactile trip.

In a phone interview with 

The Michigan Daily before the 
show, Mills described Odesza’s 
show last year opening for GRIZ 
at Masonic as “one of the hyp-
est shows we’ve ever played.” 
Emphasizing the possibilities 
the Masonic’s stage offered for 
visuals, Mills said he couldn’t 
imagine what playing a head-
line show there would be like — 
well, it was incredible.

Like I said, only a year ago 

Odesza opened for GRIZ, but 
if the two were to play a show 
together now it might be the 
other way around.

“To a lot of people it’s really 

fast climbing, but it’s kind of felt 
like a slow progression to me,” 
Mills said. “Especially in the 
last year it’s been a rapid rise.”

That seems fair to say, see-

ing as just a few months ago the 
only song my alternative music 
friends and I knew was their 
most popular “Say My Name,” 
which is now only one of many 
tracks people would be able to 
reel off. Their wide-ranging 
fan base has to be one of the 
main reasons for such a surge in 
popularity. Odesza has been, for 
me, an offshoot of several art-
ists on the edge of more main-
stream EDM genres: minimal 
techno like Nicolas Jaar, synth-
folk like Bibio or more serene-
upbeat French electronica like 
Mome or Petit Biscuit.

But the crowd on Friday 

in Detroit was not there for a 
serenely introspective jam sesh. 
They were there to party. This 
taught me something about 
shows: you take the wildest 
subset of an artist’s fan base, 
and that will make up the vast 
majority of the crowd. I prob-
ably should have known that 
from the time I got knocked 
around by some moshing met-
alheads at the Smashing Pump-
kins a couple years ago, but hey, 
nobody’s perfect.

Warming up the crowd was 

Jai Wolf, who generally had a 
pretty mellow stage presence 
but played some good mixes 
of CHVRCHES’s “Mother We 
Share” and Drake’s “Hotline 
Bling,” then finished with his 
own dreamy “Indian Summer.” 
After Jai Wolf was Rufus du Sol, 
an Australian trio more focused 
on vocals than either Jai Wolf or 
Odesza, but who really made the 
audience move.

Everyone went crazy when 

Odesza came onstage. Both 
Mills and Knight had their own 
controllers and drums, some-
times bringing up a guitarist, a 
trombone and a trumpet player. 
But the coolest part of the set 
was the combination of sounds, 

lights and animation that was 
playing 
on 
the 
five-paneled 

screen behind the artists.

The visuals ranged from gold-

painted women to this really 
cool dyed red and blue vapor (or 
something), but the sweetest one 
was this anime compilation that 
lasted for a few mixes, includ-
ing their older “IPlayYouListen” 
and the newer “Kusanagi.” This 
makes sense, since Kusanagi is 
the name of the main charac-
ter in the acclaimed 1995 anime 
Ghost in the Shell.

The highlight of the show, 

though, was “Say My Name,” 
which involved an explosion 
of lights and confetti pouring 
from the ceiling. The crowd was 
ecstatic, and that just showed 
how focused on the crowd 
Odesza was. They thanked us 
several times throughout the 
night for being there and being 
excited. Positivity and grati-
tude were definitely a focus for 
the duo through the past couple 
years touring and making new 
music, according to Mills.

“It’s 
always 
still 
positive, 

which I think helped us so 
much,” he said. “It’s really felt 
like opportunities are ahead of 
us.” It doesn’t seem like their rise 
is going to let up any time soon.

Subtle ‘Spotlight’ 
trusts its viewers

Film documenting 
pedophilia scandal 
unfolds gradually

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

In nearly every shot that takes 

place outdoors in “Spotlight,” 
the camera captures a church. 
Sometimes a character points it 
out, noting, for 
example, 
its 

proximity 
to 

a playground. 
In 
others, 

the 
camera 

lingers 
on 
a 

steeple 
and, 

in others still, 
a 
tower 
sits 

unassumingly, 
blending 
in 

amongst 
the 

modern architecture.

The city of Boston has a 

small-town feel, possessing a 
deep connection to its history, 
and so rooted with it a deep 
connection to religion; from 
its founding, Boston has been a 
Christian city. And somewhere 
along 
the 
way, 
when 
the 

institution 
of 
the 
Catholic 

Church became ingrained into 
the fabric of the city itself and in 
the hearts of the predominantly 
Catholic 
populace, 
religion 

seemed to forsake morality to 
maintain that institution.

“Spotlight” is the true story 

of The Boston Globe’s Spotlight 

investigative 
team 
as 
they 

exposed the decades-long mass 
cover-up of the Church’s blind 
eye to priests who had molested 
children. 
Like 
its 
subject, 

the 
film 
unfolds 
gradually, 

creeping along ever closer to its 
conclusion. Since the narrative 
itself is fairly well known (the 
story won a Pulitzer Prize in 
2003 after it was published in 
January 2002), its dramatic 
turns stem not from sudden 
twists but from the careful 
revelation of new information — 
the “eureka” moments that link 
seemingly disparate threads.

The film relies primarily 

on its narrative and actors to 
carry the audience through 
this tale. There is no complex 
cinematography to catch the eye 
— shots instead are, with few 
exceptions, fairly stationary. 
The only truly “cinematic” 
moment in “Spotlight” comes 
with the slow zoom out of the 
camera as the team talks on 
the phone with a priest-turned-
psychotherapist as he discusses 
the seemingly endemic issue 
of child molestation in the 
Catholic church; that zoom out 
parallels the team’s realization 
of the scope of the matter at 
hand. 
“Spotlight” 
concerns 

itself with, like its subjects, 
revealing the information in a 

direct, uncomplicated manner. 
Like any good reporter, it wants 
to nail the story, make it stick 
and let the public decide how to 
process that information.

“Spotlight” then could be 

best described as understated; it 
does not idolize its protagonists, 
nor does it necessarily vilify (to 
the extent expected, at least) 
its antagonists. It presents its 
characters as human beings, 
each of whom possess some 
sort of flaw, whether it’s an 
excessive commitment to work 
or the inadvertent perpetuation 
of the corrupt system. Multiple 
characters utter phrases like 
“I was just doing my job” and 
“It didn’t seem plausible at the 
time,” 
which 
maybe 
serves 

as 
a 
psychological 
defense 

mechanism 
for 
those 
even 

tangentially involved, but also 
simply 
highlights 
the 
very 

human quality of stumbling — to 
err is human, after all. 

The 
actors 
maintain 
this 

realism superbly. Rather than 
approach his or her character 
with 
the 
intent 
of 
reaping 

Oscar gold, each actor finds 
the character’s need to balance 
the emotions of such a highly 
controversial 
and 
significant 

story with the dutiful necessity 
of completing the task. These 
main 
characters, 
journalists 

and lawyers mostly, recognize 
that they serve the public, not 
themselves 
and 
the 
broken 

system.

Of the Spotlight team, Mark 

Ruffalo (“The Avengers: Age of 
Ultron”) stands out the most, 
if only because he speaks the 
one charged monologue about 
the obligation of publishing the 
story immediately for the sake 
of any victims. But Michael 
Keaton (“Birdman”) and Rachel 
McAdams (“Southpaw”) both 
inject nuance and care into 
their roles as equally as Ruffalo 
does into his. Liev Schreiber 
(“Pawn Sacrifice”), as the new 
editor of The Globe, and Stanley 
Tucci (“The Hunger Games: 
Mockingjay – Part 2”), as a 
frazzled lawyer looking to finally 
bring abuse victims’ cases to 
the public, embrace the quirk 
of their characters, portraying 
them as somewhat off-putting 
but also endearing. It cannot 
be overstated just how finely 
attuned each of these actors are 
to their roles; it’s so refreshing to 
watch an ensemble piece where 
the whole is greater than the sum 
of its parts.

Comparisons 
to 
“All 
the 

President’s Men” are inevitable, 
and certainly not misguided, 
though “Spotlight” is far less 
political than the former. Both 
films focus on the day-to-day, 
the unfolding of a story as it 
slowly generates steam until the 
wheels spin fast enough that it 
ultimately writes itself. It doesn’t 
always run smoothly — leads 
get lost, more pertinent matters 
arise (9/11 occurred as the 
story just started to pick up for 
Spotlight). And, in each, the job 
never ends — both films’ closing 
shots suggest the real work has 
only just begun. The characters 
identify and open the floodgates, 
but it’s in realizing, accepting and 

fixing the fallout from the deluge 
that poses the real challenge.

But in depicting just how 

those floodgates do get opened, 
the film poses some very taught 
questions. Tucci’s character, in 
talking with Ruffalo, points out 
that the two men exploring the 
scandal, himself and the new 
Globe editor, are Armenian and 
Jewish, respectively, and that 
this is not a coincidence. Time 
and routine inevitably lead to 
complacency, and complacency 
leads to blindness. It takes some-
one outside the system, like a 
journalist or sometimes a film-
maker, to dig where others feel 
is hallowed ground, or point the 
camera where we fear to look 
— and sometimes that means 
reminding us of just how badly 
we messed up. “Spotlight,” in 
this sense, is a modern, real-
life fable that reminds us how 
far we’ve come, but cautions us 
to avoid complacency. The real 
work, after all, has only just 
begun.

“You get that new Norah Jones? It’s fire.”

I 

just saw something I never 
thought I’d see on network 
television.

That seems like a ridiculous 

thing to say in 2015 — the notion 
of any storyline 
being 
“ground-

breaking” seems 
especially 
out-

dated. 
Anyone 

could turn on 
“Looking” 
and 

watch a show 
entirely absent of

male. 
Anyone 

can 
queue 
up 

Netflix and watch Annalise Keat-
ing shatter expectations on “How 
to Get Away With Murder” or 
Aziz Ansari craft jokes from pure 
pathos on “Master of None.” Any-
one could count the hundreds of 
ways these shows and characters 
subvert the typical narrative, and 
I could have enough fodder for 10 
years’ worth of TV columns.

But this is my TV column, so 

I’m going to talk about “Scandal.” 
Again. But this time, it’s different. 
“Scandal” showed me something 
I never thought I’d see on network 
television.

“Scandal” is one of the riskiest, 

most shocking shows on TV. The 
violence and graphic content it 
depicts is unparalleled among its 
broadcast peers. The President 
of the United States murdered a 
woman onscreen. Another woman 
chewed off the skin on her wrist. I 
won’t go into too much detail about 
the dozens of torture scenes that 
“Scandal” has subjected its viewers 
to, but I will say that there is one 
involving tooth-pulling, and you 
are lucky if you don’t know what 
I’m referring to. The crimes are 
difficult to watch, but “Scandal” 
handles violence with a special 
focus on the victims of violence, 
so they never feel gratuitous. In 
season three, “Scandal” explored 
Mellie’s experience as a victim 
of sexual assault, which is to this 
day one of the most devastatingly 
nuanced portrayals of rape I have 
seen on TV.

After four and a half seasons, I 

assumed that “Scandal” had been 
there and done that. There was no 
more ground to break.

However, “Scandal” is nothing 

if not surprising. Its fifth season 
has been fantastic so far, a 
welcome respite from the utter 
garbage of the show’s previous 
season. This year, “Scandal” has 
let its most intolerable characters 
(Papa Pope, Huck, Jake, basically 
everyone involved in the toxic 
B613 plot) take a step back in 
order to spotlight the relationship 
drama between Olivia and Fitz. As 
Olivia wrestles with herself over 
whether she wants to sacrifice 
her career and independence for 
Fitz’s love, Olivia suddenly finds 
her decisions are being made for 
her. News of their years-long affair 
is leaked to the press. She moves 
into the White House for her own 
protection, and there is nothing 
for her to do there except play 
the dutiful First Lady and hunt 
down a snickerdoodle recipe for 
a Congressman’s wife. She hates 
that she is so good at serving her 
man, dressing up in holiday party 
finery and standing by Fitz’s side 
like a sparkly cufflink.

A pregnant sparkly cufflink.
The mid-season finale sneaks 

this bombshell on viewers in the 
last 15 minutes of the episode. 
It truly comes out of nowhere, 
dropped in the middle of a 
narrative lull of a scene featuring 
Olivia’s father and her former 
associate. 
Eli 
Pope 
reminds 

Huck, his former employee and 
metaphorical son, that returning 
home for the holidays may not be 
as idyllic as Huck imagines. Huck 
says that if it weren’t for Olivia, 
Eli would certainly be dead. It’s 
all standard “Scandal,” and the 
details don’t really matter. But 
Eli turns the conversation ever 
so slightly. A happy home is not a 
sanctuary, but a prison: “Olivia is 
also the reason I’m shackled to this 
chair. Family is a burden.”

Cut to a close-up of Olivia’s legs 

and blue medical scrubs moving 
around them. Olivia Pope, the main 
character of a television series that 
airs at 9 p.m. on a weeknight, is 
receiving an abortion on-screen.

I can say with confidence that 

this subject matter has never been 
tackled by network TV. Some 
statistics say that one in three 
women will receive an abortion at 
some point in her life, but television 
danced around this fact. Even 
when it made narrative sense for 

a character to exercise her right to 
choose, the story almost invariably 
shifted to her changing her mind 
(Miranda on “Sex and the City”) or 
having a convenient miscarriage 
(Jessa on “Girls”). When TV 
women did receive abortions, they 
did so off-screen (Claire on “Six 
Feet Under”). One in three women 
will see the inside of that operating 
room, but TV usually shrouded 
these stories in narrative gaps and 
opaque allusions. Abortion was 
one of the few taboos TV had left, 
one of the few stories it was still 
afraid to tell.

But Olivia Pope is a strong 

woman, the kind of character 
who 
will 
smash 
every 

barrier to get the respect and 
opportunities she deserves. She 
chooses, and she is not one to 
hide behind a veneer of fakery. 
She serves no one. Olivia’s non-
stop work ethic and honesty 
inspire me in every episode, 
and I feel lucky that this 
experience that is shared by 
so many women is represented 
by someone as unbreakable 
as Olivia. And if “Scandal” ’s 
treatment of Mellie’s sexual 
assault and loss of a child are 
any indication, “Scandal” will 
not just let the abortion play 
out for shock value. Mellie bled 
and grieved young Jerry’s death 
for the better part of a season, 
and hopefully, when “Scandal” 
returns from its mid-season 
break, the show will explore 
the period of adjustment just as 
fully for Olivia.

In the monologue that scores 

Olivia’s scene on the operating 
room table, Eli says, “Family 
doesn’t complete you. It destroys 
you.” I never thought I would 
hear these kind of words on 
cautious, 
government-regulated 

network TV. I never thought that a 
television woman could be so open 
about her choice and the logical 
steps that led her to it. I thought 
that good characters, strong and 
likeable ones like Miranda Hobbes 
and Mindy Lahiri, only really had 
one option. I’m glad I was wrong.

I hope “Scandal” never stops 

surprising us.

CONCERT REVIEW

Miley’s ‘Milky’ tour 
is a sensory assault 

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

A little over a year ago Miley 

Cyrus wrapped her 78-show 
Bangerz World Tour. Saturday, 
she played the 2,888-person 
capacity Fillmore in Detroit, 
showcasing her free collabora-
tion album with psychedelic 
rock band The Flaming Lips, 
Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz. 
And as Miley explained The 
Milky Milk Milk Tour: “small-
er venue, same amount of bal-
loons.”

After an opening set by 

Dan Deacon worthy of a Van 
Goghian double amputation, it 
wasn’t clear if the show would 
be worth the nine hours in the 
freezing snow. Miley can some-
times be just plain ridiculous. 
Some of the Dead Petz mate-
rial flirts with the line between 
music and noise.

She can be on drugs. She can 

be provocative. She may not 
fully grasp large issues such 
as white privilege. But despite 
all of her shortcomings, from 
the moment she took the small 
stage, “Dooo It!” didn’t sound 
as shitty as it usually does and 
she encapsulated the crowd for 
a two-hour trip into her most 
recent musical facet.

She 
followed 
“Dooo 
It!” 

with 
its 
Bangerz-equivalent 

“Love Money Party” hyping the 
already-spirited crowd. Com-
plete with dozens of three-foot 
balloon spheres, “DO IT” nylon 
blow-ups, champagne bottles 
and a stage packed with Miley, 
her band, Amazon Ashley and a 
crew of random hippie friends/
dancers, Cyrus was the focal 
point of the most stimulating 
show in recent memory.

As queen of excess, Cyrus 

donned a slew of ridiculous 
costumes, including (but in no 
way limited to) a baby, a pair of 
bedazzled milk cartons, a stick 
of butter and a purple-haired 
unicorn with an unreasonably 
large faux penis. The outfits 
topped off the psychedelic stag-

ing consisting of a mirror ball 
the size of a piano, fog machines, 
graphic screens and light up 
cords hanging up from the ceil-
ing. That, combined with the 
bulk of Dead Petz, resulted in 
an aesthetically pleasing, some-
times overwhelming, show that 
allowed Cyrus’s raw vocal tal-
ent and genuine personality to 
shine.

The new sound focuses on 

space, animal or weed-inspired 
tracks. Actually, they’re all 
weed-inspired — some are just 
more upfront about it. The 
songs boast enough catchiness 
to roll with a crowd. Hippy-
dippy “1 Sun,” vagina jam “Bang 
Me Box” and “I Forgive Yiew” 
were among highlights. Even 
the monologue-heavy “BB Talk” 
was an honest, comical lead-in 
to the pre-“Fweaky” strip tease 
which began as Cyrus in BB 
costume, ending with a heart 
bikini top and high-waisted 
bottoms.

Slower moments emphasized 

Cyrus’s talent and tenderness. 
She covered “You Are My Sun-
shine” to mass crowd participa-
tion as well as debuting a new 
track, which seemed to nod to 
her country roots. The climac-

tic screams of “Twinkle Song” 
blur the line between beauti-
ful and egregious, landing near 
cathartic. And toward the end 
of the spectacle, the bass lines 
of “Evil Is But A Shadow” were 
the closest thing to a musical 
orgasm, with beats distinctly 
vibrating through the chests 
and over the skin of attendees.

Cyrus’s new direction aside, 

she knows what her fans want 
when she closes out the show 
with “We Can’t Stop.” The 
banger from two summers ago 
united Miley’s fans as glitter 
cannons exploded and a two-
person rainbow costume waltz 
around the stage.

The Milky Milky Milk tour 

isn’t the little sister to Bangerz 
Tour. It’s the stoner cousin who 
is always down to try some-
thing new and “fweaky.” Show-
casing her new material, Miley 
acknowledges the success of 
what came before her (some-
thing she avoided with Bangerz) 
and gave some of her closest 
fans a peek into what’s next. 
She might not be the artist she 
has the potential to be, but with 
Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz 
and the Milky Milky Milk tour, 
she’s closer than ever.

‘More’ needs more

TV REVIEW

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Television dramas about rich 

people and their wealthy lifestyles 
tend to follow a formulaic method. 
The characters 
are depicted as 
superficial, the 
storylines 
are 

usually generic 
and the drama 
is 
exaggerated 

to an excessive 
degree. 
Frequently, 
these 
white-

collar 
shows 

portray the upper class as devious, 
corrupt or greedy, their success 
only making them more obsessed 
with power and money. Though 
some of these shows have proven 
to be successful (CW’s “Gossip 
Girl” and ABC’s “Revenge”), they 
don’t always offer engrossing 
material or delve into thought-
provoking themes. Such is the case 
with Crackle’s new original series 
“The Art of More.”

While a decent attempt at being 

a suspenseful crime thriller, “The 
Art of More” is mediocre and 
somewhat perplexing, focusing 
more on glamour than on content 
and coherence. Set in the seedy 
underbelly of New York auction 
houses, the show centers around 
successful, debonair art executive 
Graham Connor (Christian Cooke, 
“Witches of East End”). Connor 
works at the upscale Parke-
Mason auction house, where he 
encounters rivals, affluent clients 
and a black-market side business. 
Based on the premise alone, “The 
Art of More” seems like it could 
be an appealing exploration into 
the lives of American socialites 

through their ventures in crime 
and debauchery. But alas, it only 
builds on bland clichés. The only 
exception is that these socialites 
bid for fancy cars and famous 
paintings, which is about as 
unexciting as it sounds.

The pilot episode, “Heavy Lies 

the Head,” doesn’t do “The Art 
of More” any storytelling justice, 
with a convoluted plot that’s 
very easy to get lost in. Several 
flashbacks are used to convey 
Graham’s 
backstory, 
but 
the 

organization of the episode sets a 
confusing tone for the show. In the 
opening scene, there is a flashback 
to an Iraqi museum in 2009, 
where Graham is an American 
soldier who becomes engaged in a 
physical struggle with art robbers 
attempting to steal a prized crown. 
Then, the scene shifts to present 
day, where Parke-Mason is selling 
that same crown for a large sum 
of money. Though the first scene 
is referenced later and gives more 
details about Graham’s past, “The 
Art of More” struggles to achieve 
any fluid connection between 
these flashbacks and Graham’s 
character.

While the cast of “The Art of 

More” is attractive and fit for 
their roles, the acting could use 
a great deal of work. Graham’s 
charismatic 
suaveness 
with 

potential 
clients 
helps 
his 

business at Parke-Mason, but 
Cooke’s stilted, robotic delivery 
as Graham makes him sound 
unconvincing. 
Dennis 
Quaid 

(“Vantage Point”) plays Sam 
Brukner, an obnoxious, Donald 
Trump-type 
billionaire 
and 

client of Parke-Mason, whose 
prominent 
drunkenness 
and 

flirtation with young women 
is grossly overused. Perhaps 

Brukner is supposed to be an 
unlikable character, but “The Art 
of More” could make his role more 
three-dimensional if it reduced 
his erratic behavior. Graham’s 
boss Arthur Davenport (Cary 
Elwes, “Saw”) acts like a typical 
slimy villain, with no distinctive 
features other than his blue suits 
and British accent. However, one 
bright spot in the mostly dull 
cast is actress Kate Bosworth 
(“Still Alice”) as the alluring, 
elusive Roxanna Whitman, one 
of Graham’s adversaries. Though 
she is on screen briefly in the 
pilot, Bosworth breathes life into 
Whitman, making her the show’s 
most intriguing and mysterious 
character. 

Unfortunately, 
Bosworth’s 

presence and the show’s stylish 
aesthetics seem to be “The Art 
of More” ’s only redeeming 
qualities. 
There 
aren’t 
any 

compelling 
twists, 
thrilling 

action sequences or exciting plot 
developments. Instead, “The Art 
of More” moves at a plodding 
pace and offers ambiguous clues 
about Graham’s mysterious past 
and ulterior motives. Considering 
“The Art of More” is featured on 
the streaming service Crackle, 
a poor man’s Netflix, it hasn’t 
reached the inventive heights 
of other online original series, 
especially since it shares the same 
platform as a raunchy animated 
series 
(“SuperMansion”) 
and 

a direct-to-video sequel of a 
David Spade movie (“Joe Dirt 2: 
Awesome Loser”). Even though 
it has some potential to break 
creative 
barriers 
for 
crime 

dramas, “The Art of More” needs 
more suspense, more character 
development and a more gripping 
plot in order to do so.

“Miley, what’s good?!?”

TV REVIEW

We need more TV 
like ‘Jessica Jones’

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Marvel’s new Netflix series 

“Jessica Jones” isn’t just the best 
female-driven superhero show 
on 
air 
right 

now (not that 
there are many) 
— it’s the best 
superhero show 
to have come 
out within the 
past few years. 
It would have 
been watchable 
even just as a 
private investi-
gator show, but 
the superhero storyline adds an 
element of intrigue that keeps us 
watching even more closely. The 
opening credits sequence feels 
bizarrely reminiscent of “Mad 
Men,” “Doctor Who” and “The 
Pink Panther,” but somehow it 
works perfectly. And the show 
itself — thanks to phenomenal 
acting, intelligently crafted plot-
lines, 
stylish 
cinematography 

and distinct lack of tired female 
superhero tropes — is addicting.

Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter, 

“Don’t Trust the B---- in Apart-
ment 23”) pays for her rent (and 
her whiskey habit) by working 
as a private investigator in New 
York City. We see immediately 
that she’s not normal — she can 
lift a car with one hand — and we 
learn that she’s “gifted” in other 
ways, as an ex-superhero. Mike 
Colter (“Million Dollar Baby”) is 
introduced in the pilot as Luke 
Cage, a bar owner gifted with a 
nearly unbreakable body. From 
the first few moments, Jones and 
Cage share tantalizing chemis-

try that quickly escalates into 
boundary-pushing sex scenes.

Jones struggles with PTSD 

from an abusive relationship 
with Kilgrave (David Tennant, 
“Doctor Who”), a gifted villain 
who can influence people not 
only to do horrible things but to 
feel like they want to do those 
things — like shooting their own 
parents in an elevator. Kilgrave’s 
abusive behaviors are often sexu-
al in nature, and Jones is not his 
first or last target.

Ritter is captivating as Jones, 

with her nuanced performance 
growing in depth throughout the 
course of the show. Ritter is as 
unaware of the camera as Jones 
is unaware of her own good 
qualities, resulting in an organic 
portrayal. Ritter accesses a wide 
emotional 
spectrum, 
playing 

Jones as brazen yet panicked 
and vulnerable, often at the same 
time. Jones never takes a moment 
to appreciate the good things she 
has done for the city or for other 
people, preferring to ignore feel-
ings of self-blame and drink to 
avoid PTSD flashbacks.

“Jessica Jones” is as strong as 

its protagonist. Ritter, Tennant 
and Colter are compelling leads, 
and the supporting cast holds 
up as well. The directors are lit-
erally shooting for subtle noir 
tones, and despite some overly 
exaggerated mood lighting and a 
couple extra-long shots of seedy 
street corners and Manhattan 
bars, the noir influences glim-
mer through. The show holds 
a surprising number of artistic 
touches, like a light percussive 
drumbeat that accompanies an 
extended bar fight scene. The 
jazz score doesn’t feel out of 

place, but accentuates the over-
all tone of the PI storyline.

While the pilot episode holds 

gems like “You’re one of them,” 
“you’re not normal” and “I’ll tell 
the world!” directed at Jones 
when she’s holding a car in one 
hand, “Jessica Jones” never relies 
too heavily on superhero-hiding-
in-plain-sight mechanisms. The 
show winks to those viewers who 
have read the comics on which 
“Jessica Jones” is based, but it’s 
also completely accessible to 
those who haven’t.

Even though it seems like we 

can never have a female superhero 
on TV who is dangerous without 
also being “damaged,” this show 
doesn’t fall into traps that female-
driven superhero shows often get 
tangled in. Despite Jones’s sultry 
voice-over narration, she isn’t 
over-sexualized and there are 
close and complex relationships 
between Jones and other women. 
There are very, very few hints of 
an “I’m not like other girls” sen-
timent. And sexual violence isn’t 
aesthetized here, but treated 
gravely, as it should be.

Jones is a capable ex-superhero, 

a cynical P.I., a survivor, a com-
plicated friend and a vulnerable 
person trying to stop an abusive 
man from barreling back into her 
life while protecting people she 
cares about. The show captures all 
of these elements equally without 
relying too heavily on any single 
one. “Jessica Jones” does justice to 
its protagonist.

But the best thing about “Jes-

sica Jones” is undoubtedly the fact 
that you can stream the entire first 
season on Netflix, right now, from 
pilot to finale. And then watch it 
again, because yes, it’s that good.

TATE COLLEGE — 
Every time, it looks 
like the Michigan 

football 
team 
is at its 
breaking 
point. 
Every 
time, it 
looks 
like 
there’s 
no more 
room 
to push 
the Wolverines further up 
against the wall. And every 
time, they scratch and claw 
and push and find an extra 
inch.

That’s all they need. One 

inch.

Fifth-year senior 

linebacker Desmond 
Morgan first explained 
it three weeks ago, 
after Michigan stopped 
Minnesota just shy of the 
goal line on the final play 
of the game on Oct. 31. 
That seemed like a close 
call, until the Wolverines 
were in the same position 

two weeks later — only this 
time in double overtime, 
exhausted by Indiana’s 
up-tempo offense, playing 
without redshirt junior 
nose tackle Ryan Glasgow.

Somehow, on Saturday, 

Michigan found itself in 
that position again. The 
Wolverines led, 21-13, with 
just over eight minutes 
to play in the game. Penn 
State was driving toward a 
game-tying score and two-
point conversion. But the 
Nittany Lions had to get 
through Michigan’s wall 
first.

On 1st-and-goal from the 

six-yard line, Penn State 
quarterback Christian 
Hackenberg threw a fade 
route at Michigan junior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis. 
That was a mistake. Lewis 
never gave him a chance.

On 2nd-and-goal from 

the six, the Nittany Lions 
gave it to running back 
Saquon Barkley on an 
outside handoff. That was 
a mistake, too. Barkley ran 
for the pylon, but Michigan

senior safety Jarrod Wilson 
chased him down at the two-
yard line.

On 3rd-and-goal from the 

two, Hackenberg threw again, 
this time well over the head of 
his intended receiver. That was 
a mistake, too. The Wolverines 
swarmed him and his receivers. 
The drive stalled, and Penn 
State kicked a field goal, never 
to have a chance like that again.

Several statistics separated 

Michigan and Penn State on 
Saturday, but look no further 
than this one: The Wolverines 
won by 12 points. Three times, 
they held the Nittany Lions to 
three instead of seven. There’s 
your ballgame.

It wasn’t a big difference. 

On Penn State’s three field goal 
drives, the Nittany Lions fell 
short of the end zone by a total 
of 13 yards. Add that to two at 
Indiana and one at Minnesota, 
and 16 yards 
could make 
the difference 
between 
playing for 
a Big Ten 
championship 
in two weeks 
or packing 
for a mid-tier 
bowl.

If you 

ask the 
Wolverines, they don’t even 
need 16 yards. All they need is 
an inch.

“It’s just a mindset,” said 

redshirt junior defensive end 
Chris Wormley. “You go out 
there, backs against the wall, 
and you know you have to hold 
them to three points or less.”

For most of the past three 

close games — excluding a 49-16 
rout of Rutgers in the middle — 
Michigan has looked extremely 
beatable. At Minnesota and 
Indiana, lesser opponents 
gashed the Wolverines’ defense 
throughout the game. At Penn 
State, minor mistakes such 
as penalties finally seemed 
destined to cost them.

But in those small situations, 

they take their inch and they 
win the game with it. In 
those small situations, they 

look unbeatable. In the past 
four games, opponents have 
journeyed into the red zone 
17 times and scored 14 times. 
Just two of them have been 
touchdowns.

After the Minnesota game, 

people criticized the Golden 
Gophers for running the ball 
into the teeth of the Michigan 
defense instead of spreading 
the field and trying to make a 
play. After the Indiana game, 
people criticized the Hoosiers 
for spreading the field and 
trying to make a play instead of 
running the ball into the teeth 
of the Michigan defense.

Finally, the Nittany Lions 

tried every which way to get 
into the end zone. They couldn’t 
do it.

You could still argue that 

each of those situations was 
mismanaged, but three of 
these games have passed now. 
Quarterback sneaks, short curl 
routes, wildcat formations, fade 
routes, inside runs, outside 
runs — opponents have tried 

everything. 
When you 
give this 
Michigan 
team an inch, 
you just can’t 
take it away.

Now, 

sometimes the 
Wolverines 
don’t even get 
an inch. The 
touchdown 

they gave up Saturday was on a 
25-yard pass play when redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers 
was beaten on a deep route. No. 
3 Ohio State, Michigan’s next 
opponent, has the weapons to 
burn them many, many more 
times than that.

But the Buckeyes would be 

wise not to give Michigan an 
inch to hold. They will likely be 
favored, but the Wolverines can 
earn a major shift in the rivalry. 
Give them an inch, and they just 
might take it a mile.

Harbaugh, Bo and Ohio State

I

t took Jim Harbaugh 
21 seconds to reference 
Bo Schembechler at his 

introductory press conference last 
December. 
He walked 
up to the 
podium and 
apologized 
for his hoarse 
voice. 

Then 

Harbaugh 
talked about 
how he 
tripped on his 
walk into the 
room, saying, “A lesser athlete 
would have gone down,” drawing 
upon Bo Schembechler’s line that 
his heart attack would have killed 
a lesser man.

Being a student of 

Schembechler is so thoroughly 
ingrained into Harbaugh’s being 
that his college coach is a part of 
his everyday life. Not only does 
he work in Schembechler Hall 
and drive past Schembechler’s old 
house daily, but Harbaugh thinks 
about his coach even in what 
otherwise could be mundane 
conversations.

It happened on Michigan’s 

flight to Saturday’s game, when 
former Michigan quarterback Jim 
Breaugh piloted the team’s plane.

“I said, ‘You know what 

Bo would tell you right now?’ 
Harbaugh asked. “ ‘Don’t screw 
it up!’ ”

He even thinks about 

Schembechler’s chief rival, 
former Ohio State coach Woody 
Hayes. One reporter Saturday 
asked Harbaugh about a Hayes 
quote about teams laying eggs 
and not performing in certain 
games. It led to a Harbaugh quip 
about comparing humans and 
chickens, but that wasn’t really 
the interesting part.

Harbaugh insisted the quote 

wasn’t true, that Woody Hayes 
never said it.

The man is a historian of 

sorts on the Michigan-Ohio 
State rivalry. Last winter, in the 
days before Harbaugh’s hiring 
at Michigan, Chase Beeler, an 
offensive lineman who played 
for Harbaugh at Stanford, said 
Harbaugh had “an extreme 
reverence” for Schembechler. 

Beeler remembered sitting 

with Harbaugh and his father, 
Jack, one night in 2009. Jim 
and Jack went back and forth 
discussing how much they 
admired Schembechler and 
Hayes, particularly how they 
brought out the greatness in one 
another. 

When Harbaugh was hired, 

this was the expectation for 
him and Ohio State coach Urban 
Meyer. They would battle as 

the head coaches of Michigan 
and Ohio State every year in the 
last week of November for the 
foreseeable future, two of the best 
coaches in the country fighting for 
Big Ten and national supremacy.

Schembechler came to 

Michigan from Miami (Ohio) at 
a time when the Buckeyes had 
taken seven of nine games from 
the Wolverines. Michigan was 
overmatched, particularly in 1968, 
the year before Schembechler 
arrived. Schembechler once 
called his first 10 games against 
Ohio State, the ones known as 
the 10-Year War, the 10 favorite 
games he ever coached against 
the Buckeyes. He bested Hayes 
in those games — the Wolverines 
went 5-4-1.

Harbaugh will get his first 

chance to begin that sort of legacy 
against Urban Meyer on Saturday.

The immediate implications 

of the upcoming game are 
now diminished. The average 
Michigan fan was devastated 
by Ohio State’s loss to Michigan 
State on Saturday. The wildest 
Harbaugh fantasy, the one of 
him coming to Ann Arbor and 
immediately leading Michigan to 
a conference championship, was 
all but shattered.

But think back to that day 

when he was hired. In all of your 
giddiness, was the first thing you 
thought about the possibility 
of Michigan winning a Big Ten 
championship? Or was it the idea 
that the Wolverines, finally, after 
losing 10 out of 11 games to their 
bitter rival down South, had a 

coach who could fight back, one 
whose team wouldn’t just get 
geared up to play the Buckeyes, 
but actually beat them?

Saturday won’t be about a Big 

Ten title, a trip to Indianapolis 
or the right to play Iowa. But you 
know darn well that Michigan 
doesn’t need to beat Iowa to 
show, once and for all, that it’s 
back.

“Right now, Ohio State and 

Michigan State are ahead of 
us,” said Michigan announcer 
Dan Dierdorf, who played on 
Schembechler’s first team, in 
August. “We can’t talk about 
national titles. We can’t talk 
about winning the Big Ten. What 
we have to do, job No. 1, is to 
become competitive with your 
chief rivals, and that’s Michigan 

State and Ohio State, and those 
are the two teams that have to 
be front and center in everything 
we do.”

Harbaugh won’t admit to that 

last statement. Publicly, he has 
always been focused on the task 
ahead for his team, abstaining 
from guarantees and absolutes 
like the one he made during his 
playing career about his team 
defeating Ohio State in 1986. But 
Schembechler, the man Harbaugh 
considers a profound influence 
on his life, was always thinking 
about the Buckeyes. He prepared 
his teams for them all year round, 
even when they didn’t know it.

Exactly how Harbaugh has 

prepared his team behind closed 
doors is unclear. But any way 
you look at it, Saturday will be 
the culmination of a year’s work. 
It started, as Michigan players 
love to say, with four-hour spring 
practices. Like Schembechler did, 
Harbaugh made his team buy in 
completely and unconditionally. 
Senior linebacker James Ross, 
who played for Brady Hoke for 
three years, said Saturday that 
anyone on Michigan’s team would 
run through a brick wall for 
Harbaugh.

Schembechler’s first team 

would have done the same for 
him. The group pulled off a 
massive upset of Ohio State in 
1969. Entering the game, the 
adversary was considered to be 
the greatest college football team 
of all time, but Schembechler had 
his team ready.

If Michigan wins this weekend, 

it wouldn’t even be considered an 
enormous surprise. Ohio State is 
ranked eighth in this week’s AP 
Poll, and the Wolverines are 12th.

But to say this edition of The 

Game doesn’t matter? You’d be 
dead wrong.

Five Things We Learned

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

For the second straight week, 

the 
Michigan 
football 
team 

went on the road, played in an 
emotionally charged atmosphere 
and took care of business.

As with Indiana last week, 

this 
opponent 
presented 

challenges: Penn State’s noisy 
crowd, 
quarterback 
Christian 

Hackenberg 
and 
a 
physical 

defensive line.

But the 12th-ranked Wolverines 

solved all of them. They escaped 
with another victory, setting up 
this week’s rivalry clash with 
Ohio State at Michigan Stadium.

Here are five things we learned 

Saturday:

1. The defensive line will be fine 

without Ryan Glasgow.

After last week’s game at 

Indiana, what was originally one 
of the strengths of the team looked 
like a glaring weakness. The 
Hoosiers rolled over Michigan for 
307 rushing yards and 41 points 
before falling in double overtime.

The 
culprit, 
it 
appeared, 

was the loss of redshirt junior 
nose tackle Ryan Glasgow, who 
injured his pectoral muscle the 
week before against Rutgers. 
With Glasgow out for the season, 
the future looked bleak. The 
Wolverines needed to be better on 
the defensive front at Penn State, 
and they were.

Against the run, they stifled 

Penn State running back Saquon 
Barkley, 
who 
managed 
just 

68 yards on 15 carries — even 
though one of those carries went 
for 56 yards. Michigan’s biggest 
stands came on its first series and 
second-to-last series. Both times, 
the Wolverines held the Nittany 
Lions to only a field goal inside the 
10-yard line.

But 
their 
biggest 
impact 

was in the passing game. They 
sacked Penn State’s Christian 
Hackenberg 
four 
times 
and 

hurried 
him 
plenty 
more, 

disrupting the aerial attack and 
making it nearly impossible for 
the Nittany Lions to come back. 
Michigan faces an even tougher 

test next week against Ohio State, 
but the resurgence in this area 
bodes well for the rivalry game 
Saturday.

2. Michigan’s penalties are an 

issue.

Some were unambiguous, such 

as the Wolverines’ four offside 
and two false start penalties. 
Some were controversial, such as 
redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers’ pass interference, after 
which 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh angrily threw off his 
hat and coat.

The Wolverines have had a 

significant problem with penalties 
in the past two weeks. Saturday, 
they committed 13 for 117 yards, 
giving Penn State six of its 14 first 
downs. Michigan dominated in 
many facets, but its miscues kept 
the Nittany Lions in the game for 
too long.

The most fixable issue is 

the four offside penalties from 
jumping the snap early. That 
might solve itself Saturday in 
front of a home crowd after two 
straight road games. At any rate, 
the Wolverines can’t afford to give 
Ohio State free yards.

3. The running game still has 

some things to work out.

Those things have seemed 

trivial over the past three weeks. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
quarterback 

Jake Rudock’s emergence has 
made everyone forget about the 
running game. The Wolverines 
haven’t needed it.

But 
Michigan 
needs 
to 

re-establish the ground game 
soon. 
Junior 
running 
back 

De’Veon Smith was the leading 
rusher Saturday with just 39 yards 
on 13 carries. Redshirt junior 
wide 
receiver 
Jehu 
Chesson 

was second, despite getting only 
one carry. The Wolverines are 
now tied for 81st in the country 
in rushing with 161.4 yards per 
game.

No Michigan running back 

has hit the 100-yard mark since 
September, and the road doesn’t 
get any easier: At 30th in the 
country, Ohio State’s rush defense 

will give the Wolverines another 
tough test.

4. College football guarantees 

nothing.

When the Wolverines walked 

off the field Saturday, the stage 
seemed set. A contingent of 
Michigan fans greeted the team 
at the tunnel after the game. Some 
chanted “BEAT OHIO.” All that 
had to happen to set up a winner-
take-all showdown for the Big Ten 
East next week was Ohio State 
beating Michigan State later that 
day.

But in college football, all that 

has to happen rarely does. With 
quarterback Connor Cook injured 
and not playing, the Spartans 
rolled into Columbus and knocked 
off the Buckeyes, 17-14, on a game-
winning field goal as time expired.

So, Michigan and Ohio State 

will play their normal rivalry game 
Saturday at Michigan Stadium. 
Either could still make the Big 
Ten Championship against Iowa. 
But they’ll need some help: Penn 
State will have to upset Michigan 
State in East Lansing.

Who knows? Maybe that will 

happen too. Nothing is ever 
certain.

5. BOLD PREDICTION: Jake 

Rudock will throw for 400 
yards against Ohio State.

The days of Rudock playing 

against Indiana-caliber defenses 
are over. While he might not 
reach the milestone as easily as 
he did two weeks ago against 
the Hoosiers, he will have his 
chances.

The Buckeyes will provide 

more opposition, but they will 
also put up points, perhaps 
forcing 
Michigan 
to 
pass 

for most of the game. And 
if 
the 
Wolverines’ 
running 

game continues to struggle, it 
will give Rudock even more 
opportunities. Each of the past 
two Michigan-Ohio State games 
have been shootouts, and the 
Wolverines’ passing game has 
produced in both.

This year, the unit has never 

looked better. Rudock is the first 
quarterback in Michigan history 
to throw for more than 250 yards 
in three straight games. He’s 
clicking with each of his three 
top receivers — redshirt junior 
wideouts 
Jehu 
Chesson 
and 

Amara Darboh and junior tight 
end Jake Butt. Expect the group 
to have a big day this weekend.

Jake Rudock threw for more than 250 yards for the third straight game Saturday.

An almost-

perfect 
weekend

B

OSTON — With 4:28 to 
go in the final period of 
Saturday’s game against 

No. 10 Boston University and 
the Michigan 
hockey team 
up, 3-1, junior 
forward Max 
Shuart found 
himself on a 
breakaway. 
After receiv-
ing a diving 
poke-check 
pass from 
freshman 
forward Kyle 
Connor, Shuart deked once 
before putting the puck past the 
Terrier goaltender.

Shuart’s goal allowed the 

Wolverines to finally breathe 
a sigh of relief, putting an 
exclamation point on an overall 
successful weekend.

“It was nice to get it going in 

the third and get the lead up a 
little bit,” said junior forward 
JT Compher.

The goal shouldn’t have been 

the first time the Wolverines 
breathed a sigh of relief, though. 
In fact, Shuart’s goal should 
have been the cherry on top 
of an undefeated weekend in 
Boston.

Michigan should have 

passed its first real test of the 
season with flying colors, twice 
beating a highly ranked Boston 
University side that hadn’t lost 
in three weeks.

That’s not what happened, 

though. Instead, the 
Wolverines’ second game was 
the only one in which they came 
away with a win.

Less than 24 hours prior 

to their 4-2 win Saturday, the 
Wolverines held a two-goal 
lead at the end of third period, 
similar to one they held in their 
game the next night.

But the difference was that 

the minute the Terriers got on 
the scoreboard with 9:16 left 
in the game, the once-quiet 
Agganis Arena woke up, and 
pandemonium ensued.

Boston University scored 

again to tie the game just 12 
seconds later and finished off 
the Wolverines with three 
minutes left in the game with 
a goal from defenseman Doyle 
Somerby.

“We saw we were up 2-0 

heading into the third, and we 
really wanted to lock down the 
(defensive zone), which took 
away from our aggressiveness,” 
said junior forward Tyler Motte 
after Friday’s loss. “Intensity 
from our end went down a little 
too low. Obviously, you have 
to defend the lead, but we also 
have to play our game, and 
that’s not something we did.”

If Michigan had kept its 

pedal on the gas for 10 more 
minutes, it could have walked 
out of Boston with two massive 
wins.

It’s like doing really well 

on an exam, but missing out 

on the big point questions and 
still getting a B+ even though 
you only missed one or two 
problems.

“We just played a very good 

hockey team,” said Boston 
University coach David Quinn 
after Saturday’s game. “They’re 
big, strong and fast. Their 
forwards keep you on your 
heels, and they were the better 
team over the weekend, without 
question.”

And most would agree with 

Quinn. The Wolverines were 
the better team for five-plus 
periods.

But the Pairwise Rankings 

don’t take into account losses 
that were almost wins. That’s 
not how it works.

No matter how many 

questions you get right on the 
test, if you only get 88 percent 
of the points on an exam, you 
usually get a B+. No ifs, ands or 
buts.

The computer will just see 

that the Michigan went on the 
road to Boston University and 
came away with both a win and 
a loss.

While the end result wasn’t 

ideal, by no means was it 
terrible either.

In fact, the series was 

quite a good showing by the 
Wolverines and one they 
should be proud of. Boston 
was the 10th-ranked team in 
the country and sports some 
of the best players around, 
including 2014-2015 First Team 
All-American defenseman 
Matt Grzelcyk, as well as 
forward Jordan Greenway and 
defenseman Charlie McAvoy, 
two highly touted freshmen 
who played on the United States 
Under-18 National Team a year 
ago.

“(Boston University’s) a good 

team,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “They’re going to win 
a lot of games, and they showed 
it on Friday. We didn’t let them 
play well tonight.”

After playing no ranked 

teams prior to the weekend 
series, the Terriers presented 
the Wolverines with Berenson’s 
first gauge of how his team 
matches up against college 
hockey’s elite. Also considering 
the fact that the Wolverines 
had never won in Agganis 
Arena, just getting one win was 
impressive.

“Anytime you win Boston, it’s 

a good win,” Berenson said.

But the reality is that the 

Wolverines played their best 
hockey of the season and had 
two wins well within their 
grasp, and 10 minutes of 
hockey separated them from 
just passing their first test to 
blowing it out of the water.

A B+ performance isn’t bad, 

but an A+ performance was 
definitely there for the taking.

‘M’ earns split in Boston

Wolverines recover 

from meltdown 
Friday to win 
finale Saturday

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

BOSTON — Three weeks 

ago, the Michigan hockey team 
suffered its first loss of the 
season 
against 
Robert 
Morris. 
It was the Wolverines’ first 
afternoon 
game, 
and 
the 

Colonials shut out Michigan at 
home.

After the game, Michigan 

coach Red Berenson said one 
team always has more energy 
in an afternoon game, and that 
team always wins.

“I told my team this morning 

that there would be one team 
that would come out hungrier 
than the other,” Berenson said 
after the Robert Morris loss 
on Oct. 31. “In these afternoon 
games, that’s how it works. We 
thought we’d be that team, but 
we weren’t.”

Saturday 
afternoon, 
the 

Wolverines were that team. 
No. 12 Michigan outshot No. 
10 Boston University, 38-21, en 
route to a 4-2 win.

“We knew we had to come out 

and start on time and play well 
at the beginning,” said junior 
forward 
JT 
Compher. 
“We 

had had a lot of, I wouldn’t say 
anger, but we wanted to send a 
message.”

Like it did a day earlier, 

Michigan (6-2-1) started the 
day’s scoring. Ninety seconds 
into Michigan’s first power-play 
opportunity, junior defenseman 
Michael Downing lined up a 
shot from the blue line that 
freshman 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody redirected past Boston 
University netminder Connor 

LaCouvee.

It didn’t take the Wolverines 

long to add to their early 
lead when freshman forward 
Brendan 
Warren, 
on 
a 

breakaway, backhanded one over 
LaCouvee’s 
left shoulder.

However, 

the feeling still 
wasn’t secure 
for 
Michigan 

hockey 
fans. 

Friday, 
the 

Wolverines 
jumped out to 
a 2-0 lead over 
the 
Terriers 

(6-4-2), 
but 

conceded 
three 
unanswered 

goals in the third period in their 
second loss of the year.

Saturday was a different story. 

With three minutes left in the 
first frame, Downing, on a power 
play once again, got his shot 
through from the blue line. This 
time, junior forward Alex Kile 
was there to collect the rebound 
that he ultimately backhanded 
over LaCouvee.

The second period was a 

stalemate for 19 minutes before 
Boston 
University 
forward 

Matt Lane took a long pass 
from forward Doyle Somerby 
and brought the puck in from 

the right slot 
before beating 
Racine via the 
five hole.

And 
when 

the 
second-

period buzzer 
rang a minute 
later, it was 
the same story 
as a day before: 
Michigan was 
up two goals, 

outshooting the Terriers by 
more than 10 while dominating 
the game.

More notably, during the 

final five minutes of the second 
period, the Wolverines looked 
like they were playing not to 
lose, rather than playing to win. 
Berenson said that was the sole 
reason for Friday’s collapse.

But 
Berenson 
stressed 

that 
message 
during 
the 

second 
intermission, 
and 

the Wolverines looked like a 
completely different team in the 
third period than they did a day 
before. Compher said the team 
was well aware of that during 
the second intermission.

“I didn’t have to say much,” 

Compher said. “We just knew we 
had to keep the gas pedal down 
and play to win and play our goal. 
It was a good period by us, and one 
of the best we played all year.”

With three minutes left in 

the game, junior forward Max 
Shuart received a pass from 
freshman forward Kyle Connor 
and beat LaCouvee for his first 
goal of the season.

And with Shuart’s goal, the 

Wolverines, despite letting up 
a final-second goal, cruised to 
their first afternoon win of the 
season and left a tough road 
series against Boston University 
with a win.

“To come out and play the way 

we did today leaves a good taste 
in our mouth,” Compher said.

Added Berenson: “Any time you 

win in Boston, it’s a good win.”

WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY
MEN’S CROSS COUNTRY

Michigan equals 
rank, takes sixth

Finn earns All-
America honors 

after running most 

of race barefoot

By LANEY BYLER

For the Daily

The Michigan women’s cross 

country team ended its season 
at the NCAA Championship 
on Saturday with a sixth-
place 
finish, 
matching 
its 

No. 6 national ranking. The 
result marked the Wolverines’ 
12th 
top-10 
finish 
at 
the 

championship meet, with 11 of 
them falling under the guidance 
of coach Mike McGuire.

The team went into the race 

striving for a podium finish, 
expecting to work hard and push 
for a spot in the top three.

Michigan junior Erin Finn, 

however, wasn’t expecting to lose 
her shoes.

Shortly after the 2K mark in 

the 6,000-meter race, Finn was 
clipped by a runner behind her, 
and as a result, lost both of her 
shoes and socks. Despite the 
setback, Finn continued to run 
barefoot.

“It speaks volumes about how 

tough she really is, because the 
easy way out would have been to 
walk off of the course,” McGuire 
said. “We were not running on a 
pristine golf course. Part of it was 
on a gravel road, part of it was 
traversing sidewalks. She wasn’t 
over at Grand Haven walking on 
the beach.”

Finn placed 19th with a final 

time of 20:10:2 and was awarded 
All-American honors for the 
second time in her career. Finn 
is the seventh Michigan runner 
to be awarded multiple All-
American honors.

Senior Shannon Osika was the 

next Michigan athlete to cross 
the finish line, placing 53rd with 
a time of 20:33.2. Osika, and 
fifth-year senior Anna Pasternak, 
who placed 120th with a time 

of 20:59.3, ended their cross 
country careers at the NCAA 
Championships.

“Shannon has been a mainstay 

in the lineup for the four years 
she’s been here,” McGuire said. 
“Anna is someone who has 
progressed and ran in her first 
Championship last year and 
really had an outstanding fifth 
year this year. They’ve impacted 
us 
race-wise, 
and 
they’ve 

impacted us with their presence 
as being good teammates. I’ve 
just got good thoughts on what 
both of them have contributed to 
the program.”

Gina 
Sereno, 
a 
redshirt 

sophomore, placed third among 
Wolverine finishers at 90th place 
with a time of 20:47.2. Redshirt 
sophomore 
Jaimie 
Phelan 

followed closely behind, crossing 
the finish line just 2.8 seconds 
after Sereno but placing 100th.

Sophie 
Linn 
and 
Jamie 

Morrissey, 
also 
redshirt 

sophomores, made their NCAA 
Championship 
debuts 
on 

Saturday, 
placing 
145th 
and 

180th, respectively.

“Sophie is a much better runner 

than she was last year,” McGuire 
said. “Jaime is a little more of a 
middle-distance 
specialist, 
so 

she’s still adapting to racing a 6K, 
but they got their feet wet, so we 
expect an improvement on what 
they can do.”

The NCAA Championships 

capped a strong season. The 
Wolverines were the runners-up 
at the Big Ten Championships 
and brought home a Great Lakes 
Regional title, to go along with 
the sixth-place finish at the 
NCAA Championships.

“The team has depth,” Finn 

said. “We have a lot of girls who 
can be in the top five, or the top 
10, and that really shows, because 
you can’t count on everyone 
having their best day every time. 
But when you have a lot of girls 
who are really good, you don’t 
have to have your best day every 
time, and you can still perform 
well because you know that 
someone has your back.”

Wolverines claim 
ninth-place finish

After winning 

Big Ten, regional, 

Michigan falls 
short of podium

By BILLY STAMPFL

Daily Sports Writer

Following a ninth-place finish 

at the NCAA Championships on 
Saturday, the Michigan men’s 
cross country team felt an eerie 
combination of gratification and 
disappointment. Despite ending 
the season as a top-10 team, the 
Wolverines had even higher 
expectations after winning both 
the Big Ten Championship and 
the Great Lakes Regional.

“As a whole, I think we’re 

content,” junior co-captain Ben 
Flanagan said. “But we’re also 
definitely all still hungry for 
more.”

Flanagan finished 83rd overall 

at the NCAA Championships to 
go along with senior Mason Ferlic 
(67th) 
and 

senior 
Tony 

Smoragiewicz 
(72nd) 
in 

forming 
Michigan’s top 
three runners.

Ferlic, 

who won the 
regional 
title 

last weekend, 
started 
strong before 
uncharacteristically falling back 
with just 2,000 meters to go.

“(Ferlic) had a goal of trying to 

be in the top 10 at nationals,” said 
coach Kevin Sullivan. “For 90 
percent of the race he executed 
really well, but I think it was an 
unusually fast day up front.”

Despite noting that the team 

had slightly higher expectations 
in comparison to its actual 
performance, Sullivan remained 
positive and commended the 
Wolverines’ efforts.

“We hit every goal that we set 

out to this season,” Sullivan said. 

“This team has really come a long 
way in the last two years.”

Sullivan has found immediate 

success in just his second year 
as head coach after a decorated 
career as a student-athlete at 
Michigan. In six years, he won 
Big Ten Athlete of the Year four 
times and was also a four-time 
All-American.

Sullivan’s experience as a cross 

country runner has certainly 
aided his success as a coach.

“It’s hard to truly explain how 

much guys like (Sullivan) can 
help out,” Flanagan said. “He’s 
been to all of these meets, and 
he’s been in our shoes so many 
times. We have confidence in 
every word he says, because 
we know he’s speaking from 
personal experience.”

Despite his players’ praise, 

Sullivan refuses to take credit for 
the program’s achievements over 
the past two years.

“This 
season 
was 
about 

these guys continuing to build 
confidence,” Sullivan said. “It’s 
really more about what they’ve 

done 
than 

what I’ve done 
as a coach.”

Moving 

forward, 
the 

team will look 
to replace top 
runners such 
as Ferlic and 
Smoragiewicz, 
whose 
combination 
of talent and 

strong leadership contributed to 
the team’s success.

“We have some gaps to fill 

next year,” Sullivan said. “I’ll 
be expecting that some of our 
younger guys and the guys 
coming in next fall will be able to 
fill those roles.”

With next year on the horizon 

and a ninth-place finish now 
in the past, the mood may well 
shift from slight frustration to 
anticipation of what’s to come. 
Still, Sullivan made one thing 
clear: “Overall, we have nothing 
to be disappointed about.”

“We’re also 
definitely all 
still hungry 
for more.”

Lewis’ kick return, Wolverines’ 
special teams break PSU’s back

By MAX COHEN 

Managing Sports Editor

STATE COLLEGE — With 

8:05 remaining in Saturday’s 
game 
against 
Penn 
State, 

Jourdan Lewis turned to Jim 
Harbaugh.

The Nittany Lions had cut 

what was once a 21-10 deficit to 
21-16, and they had just kicked 
a field goal from the Michigan 
football team’s one-yard line. 
If Penn State had converted 
the fourth down and scored a 
touchdown, it would have had 
the chance to go for the two-
point conversion to tie the game. 
Penn State coach James Franklin 
preferred to cut the Wolverines’ 
lead to five, and settled for the 
field goal.

So 
Lewis 
smelled 
blood. 

The 
junior 
cornerback 
has 

impacted games all season long 
by shutting down opposing wide 
receivers, but Saturday’s game 

was his third straight returning 
kicks. In the newer role, he had 
an opportunity to go for the 
jugular.

In the middle of the huddle 

before his kick return, Lewis 
looked over at Harbaugh and 
told him he was going to break 
the Nittany Lions’ back.

Harbaugh’s 
response 
was 

succinct: “Go ahead.”

Lewis 
took 
his 
coach’s 

permission and ran with it. He 
returned the ensuing kickoff 
55 
yards, 
leaving 
would-be 

tacklers grasping for air. Lewis 
created space all the way to Penn 
State’s 40-yard line, setting 
the Wolverines up for a game-
clinching touchdown drive.

“He was just competing like a 

maniac throughout that return, 
just refusing to go down,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“That 
was 

fantastic.” 

The importance of special 

teams is not lost on Michigan. 

The unit does not meet alone 
during weeks of practice — every 
special teams meeting is a team 
meeting, and a part of game 
preparation that both Harbaugh 
and special teams coordinator 
John Baxter consider crucial to 
team building.

The 

Wolverines 
have 
found 

out 
firsthand 

what happens 
if 
special 

teams plays — 
the ones that 
so 
frequently 

seem mundane 
— don’t go as planned. There 
was, of course, the fumbled punt 
that cost them a win against 
Michigan State last month. And 
Michigan surrendered return 
touchdowns 
against 
Rutgers 

and Indiana in its previous two 
games, though those errors 
weren’t nearly as costly.

At some points Saturday, it 

appeared as if special teams 
issues would hurt Michigan 
once again. With just over four 
minutes remaining in the second 
quarter, fifth-year senior punter 
Blake O’Neill’s kick was blocked, 

allowing Penn 
State to take 
over 
on 
the 

Wolverines’ 
43-yard line.

The Nittany 

Lions needed 
just six plays 
to 
score 
on 

the 
ensuing 

possession, 

and they took a 10-7 lead. Penn 
State enjoyed the lead for just 
1:10.

Once the Wolverines regained 

the lead, the special teams 
performance also turned in their 
favor. Michigan extended its lead 
to 21-10 in the third quarter in 
large part due to a special teams 
miscue by the Nittany Lions.

O’Neill lined up to punt with 

about 7:30 remaining in the third 
quarter after the Wolverines’ 
drive stalled on Penn State’s 
43-yard line. His kick landed 
in the arms of Nittany Lions 
returner DeAndre Thompkins, 
but only for a moment.

Thompkins muffed the punt, 

and Michigan redshirt junior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson 
emerged from a brief scrum with 
the ball. The Wolverines took 
over possession on Penn State’s 
nine-yard line and scored a 
touchdown three plays later.

After the game, Harbaugh said 

that Saturday’s victory might 
have been the one for Michigan 
in 
which 
the 
most 
people 

contributed. The Wolverines, 
when it mattered most, made 
some of the game’s routine plays 
count.

“Everybody does a little, and 

it adds up to a lot,” Harbaugh 
said.

If all goes well, as it did 

Saturday, 
the 
contributions 

add up to a broken back for the 
opponent.

Xavier outmuscles ‘M’

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team was just eight minutes 
into its first real non-conference 
challenge of 
the season, 
but 
Caris 

LeVert was fired up.

The senior guard got in Xavier 

forward Jalen Reynolds’ face after 
a hard foul sent LeVert crashing 
into the base of the basket. The 
boos rained down at Crisler 
Center before the under-12 media 
timeout halted the confrontation.

Reynolds and the rest of 

Xavier’s 
frontcourt 
certainly 

didn’t come to Ann Arbor to make 
any friends, and the end result 
was an immensely physical game 
featuring 48 total fouls and 52 free 
throws. Despite LeVert’s 29-point 
performance, the Musketeers’ 
physicality proved too much for 
the Wolverines to handle.

Even with Reynolds in foul 

trouble for most of the second 
half, Xavier capitalized on its 
bevy of second chances — 18 
offensive rebounds — and beat the 
Wolverines, 86-70.

“(The Musketeers) hit the 

backboards 
obviously 
much 

better than us, they got loose 
balls, they have tremendous grit,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“They’ve got a great mix of guys 
who can shoot the ball with the 
big men. ... They’ve got a really 
experienced team that knows 
how to win.”

After Xavier took over the 

game with an 8-0 run late in the 
first half, Michigan found itself 
in a nine-point hole after the 
first frame. Then, an offensive 
surge led by redshirt sophomore 
Duncan Robinson, who made his 
first two 3-pointers off the bench 
in the second half, cut the lead to 
just two.

But the Musketeers answered 

with a triple of their own, and then 
another after LeVert connected 
from beyond the arc on the next 
possession.

From there, Xavier’s physicality 

took over. After LeVert’s 3, 
the Musketeers outscored the 
Wolverines 25-11 the rest of the 
way, mostly due to their continued 
ability to get to the free throw line 
against Michigan’s overwhelmed 
defenders. 

“We’ve got to get stops,” 

Beilein said. “We can dial up 
(the offense) all we want. It’s not 
about the offensive end. … We 
cannot give up that many points, 
that kind of percentage, off of 
that many foul shots.”

Xavier made runs in the first 

half, too, scoring the game’s first 
seven points. But the Wolverines 
battled back on the strength of 
LeVert’s 
offensive 
versatility. 

The captain scored Michigan’s 
first points of the game with a 
contested layup, peppered the 
Musketeers with several mid-
range jumpers and took his game 
beyond the arc with back-to-back 

3-pointers to put the Wolverines 
ahead 26-24 with 6:39 remaining 
in the first half.

LeVert finished the day with 

29 points, three assists and seven 
rebounds, but he alone wasn’t 
able to stop Xavier’s frequent 
scoring runs.

Plenty of Michigan’s shots 

just missed the mark when the 
Wolverines needed to fight back 
in the game. Both junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. and sophomore 
guard Aubrey Dawkins completely 
missed 
the 
rim 
on 
3-point 

attempts, and Dawkins missed an 
open layup on a fast break early in 
the second half.

“We’ve 
just 
got 
to 
keep 

developing as a team,” LeVert 
said. “When we get layups, we’ve 
got to make them. We’ve got to 
knock down our free throws. 
We’ve got to hit open shots. ... But 
we had 70 points — that’s enough 
to win a basketball game.”

Big men struggle 
to control Xavier

Musketeers grab 18 
offensive rebounds, 

dominate four 
Michigan bigs

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

With just over eight minutes 

left in the game, Jalen Reynolds 
stood on the Crisler Center 
steps, surrounded by Michigan 
fans, and flexed his muscles. 

Reynolds 
had 
just 
fouled 

sophomore 
forward 
Aubrey 

Dawkins, who continued on to 
make both free throws, but the 
Xavier big man didn’t care. The 
Musketeers 
outmuscled 
the 

Wolverines in an 86-70 victory 
that included 48 fouls, with 11 
of them going against Michigan 
big men.

The Musketeers grabbed 18 

offensive rebounds over the 
course of the game, scoring 16 
second-chance points off of 
them, and consistently grabbed 
the ball out of the reach of the 
Wolverines’ centers. Michigan 
coach John Beilein has wanted 
to slim down his 12-man roster, 
but he wasn’t able to Friday. 
Beilein has been rotating four 
men in at the big man spot, but 
that decision didn’t become any 
clearer after 40 minutes against 
Xavier.

“We 
got 
into 
early 
foul 

trouble, so I’m sure it was 
tough for (the big men) to get a 
rhythm,” said senior forward 
Caris LeVert. “Mark (Donnal), I 
think, had three in the first half, 
so that was tough, definitely. 
I think Moe (Wagner) gave us 
some great minutes when he was 
called upon, so we’ve just gotta 

keep growing at that position.”

Junior forward Mark Donnal 

started, as he did the first two 
games of the season, but was 
yanked after the first minute 
and a half after losing the tip 
to Reynolds and allowing him 
to drive to the basket, fouling 
Reynolds on the way there.

“Mark certainly didn’t have 

a good day today,” Beilein 
said. “He appeared to be a bit 
overmatched.

“We’re trying not to foul, but 

that’s hard for us to do with that 
quickness. (Xavier) just came 
right at us.” 

Beilein threw in sophomore 

forward 
Ricky 
Doyle 
after 

Donnal’s woes, but that didn’t 
help matters 
much. Doyle 
was too slow 
on the inside 
and couldn’t 
compete with 
Reynolds 
or 
Xavier 

forward 
James 
Farr, 

who 
totaled 

13 rebounds.

Six 

minutes after Doyle entered the 
game, LeVert dished the ball 
to him for an and-1. But Doyle 
missed the free throw.

Seconds later, he fouled guard 

Remy Abell and caused an and-1 
on the other side, but this time, 
Abell made the free throw. 

Little things like missed free 

throws add up, and entering 
halftime, Xavier led Michigan, 
45-36. Though the Musketeers 
and Wolverines made the same 
number of field goals, Xavier 
outscored 
Michigan 
at 
the 

free throw line by nine points. 
The effects were visible on the 
halftime score. 

“It was frustrating,” LeVert 

said. “We had a lot of ticky-
tack 
fouls 
defensively 
that 

really killed us, and they shot 
the lights out at the free-throw 
line. The 50-50 balls at the end 
killed us.”

In the first half, Xavier 

had more made free throws, 
rebounds and assists and had 
fewer turnovers and fouls than 
Michigan. 
The 
Wolverines 

forgot the fundamentals.

Forwards Moritz Wagner and 

DJ Wilson entered the game late 
in the first half to relieve Doyle 
and Duncan, but struggled to 
stay on the court and make and 
impact. Wagner and Wilson 
played seven and five minutes, 

respectively, 
but 
hardly 

made a dent 
on 
the 
box 

score.

After 

Donnal 
collected 
three fouls in 
the first half, 
Doyle started 
the 
second. 

On the first 

play, he drove to the hoop for 
a layup, and hope returned to 
Michigan fans.

That dream was shattered 

after Xavier maintained its lead 
for the rest of the half. Though 
the Wolverines got close to 
closing the gap in the beginning, 
the Musketeers pulled away in 
the last 10 minutes, going on a 
14-3 run to seal the deal.

“It was tough,” LeVert said. 

“Guys were knocking down 
shots, like we expected. But at 
the end of the day, we had 70 
points — that’s enough to win a 
basketball game. We’ve gotta be 
better on the defensive end.”
