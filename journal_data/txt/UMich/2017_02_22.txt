work, you might soon be 
receiving 
packages 
from 

someone other than a mailman 
— instead, a robotic bird. 

The University will be the 

first institution to program 
and test “Cassie,” a robot with 
the mobility of a bird and 
the potential to transform 
efficient energy usage. The 
robot, created by the Agility 
Robotics program at Oregon 
State 
University, 
will 
be 

arriving at the lab belonging 
to Jessy Grizzle, professor of 

electrical 
engineering 
and 

computer science. Grizzle has 
also worked on robot bipeds 
— machines that use two legs 
to walk — similar to Cassie, 
which takes the form of a large 
bird. Grizzle is well-known 
throughout 
the 
nation 
for 

his work on bipeds and has 
collaborated with Oregon State 
University before — which is 
why Cassie will be tested by his 
lab. 

Grizzle 
said 
Cassie’s 

inventors did not plan on 
its 
aviary 
appearance, 
but 

tweaked their design when 
mathematics proved that the 
robot would perform better 
with this form.

City 
Council 
voted 

unanimously 
Tuesday 
to 

postpone an initial vote on an 
ordinance intended to protect 
Ann Arbor’s undocumented 
residents, citing a need to 
tighten exceptions originally 
provided in the ordinance.

The ordinance comes after 

an executive order signed 
by President Donald Trump 
in January providing for the 
removal of federal grants for 
“sanctuary 
jurisdictions,” 

which the order defines as 
jurisdictions that refuse to 
assist 
federal 
agencies 
in 

identifying 
and 
detaining 

undocumented 
immigrants. 

Additionally, implementation 
memos for the order released 
Monday expanded the federal 
government’s 
authority 
to 

allow lower jurisdictions to 
carry out the duties of federal 
immigration agencies.

At the Feb. 6 meeting 

of City Council, members 
unanimously 
passed 
a 

resolution directing the city 
administrator to review the 
executive order and “provide 
advice 
regarding 
possible 

options or actions the city 
might take to protect the 
rights of the city and persons 
within its jurisdiction.”

The ordinance proposed 

Tuesday 
would 
prohibit 

city employees from asking 
residents 
about 
their 

immigration 
statuses, 
but 

provides several exceptions to 
the prohibition. According to 
the ordinance, city employees 
would be permitted to inquire 
into a resident’s immigration 
status while assisting federal 
law 
enforcement 
in 
the 

investigation of a criminal 
or civil offense, or while 
processing 
an 
arrested 

person.

Ann Arbor resident Jessica 

Prozinski said the exceptions 
defeated the original purpose 
of the ordinance, opposing it 

on those grounds.

“The resolution, I believe, 

had good intentions, as far as 
strengthening Ann Arbor’s 
don’t-ask-don’t-tell 
policy,” 

she said. “This resolution, I 
think, has actually become

he

and the other authors of the

argued 
the

surveys did not take Middle

“In 1944, all Arabs were 

marked as white in the United 
States because whiteness was 
a prerequisite for citizenship,” 
Jones said. “That changed in

Current political discourse in GOP could repeal act which provides medical care to millions

Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell 
(D–

Mich.) accompanied a panel 
at the University of Michigan 
Ford School of Public Policy 
Tuesday night to discuss the 
impacts 
of 
the 
Affordable 

Care Act. The panel, hosted by 
the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
along with Progressives at the 
University of Michigan, also 
answered public questions to 
an audience of approximately 
100 
students, 
faculty 
and 

community members.

Panelists began by laying 

out 
facts 
about 
the 
ACA 

itself, 
explaining 
that 
20 

million previously uninsured 
Americans 
gained 
health 

insurance because of the act. 
In 
Michigan, 
the 
“Healthy 

Michigan” plan reduced the 
number of uninsured citizens 
by 50 percent, allowing nearly 
700,000 people in Michigan 

to 
gain 
health 
insurance, 

according to Dingell. 

The panel comes during a 

time of concerns surrounding 
a 
possible 
repeal 
of 
the 

ACA from GOP lawmakers. 
Panelists described the idea 
of “repeal and replace” as 
more of a slogan than a plan

The Push to Change History on Campus 


NEW SUDOKU WHO DIS?

2A — Wednesday, February 22, 2017
News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

After bipartisan pressure, 

the Michigan state legislature 
modified its initial proposal 
from 
one 
which 
would 

completely 
eliminate 
the 

state’s 4.25-percent income 
tax to one that will gradually 
lower the tax to 3.9 percent 
over four years.

This change occurred after 

nine 
university 
presidents 

from public schools across 
the 
state, 
including 
Mark 

Schlissel, president of the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

gathered Tuesday morning in 
front of the House chamber 
to lobby against the original 
proposal.

The university presidents 

were 
concerned 
the 

elimination of the income tax 

would lead to constraints in 
the state’s budget, potentially 
a gap of more than $1 billion 
in the first fiscal year and 
subsequently 
decrease 

university 
funding. 
The 

presidents 
cited 
concerns 

such 
as 
higher 
education 

inaccessibility and the rising 
cost of a college education as 
reasons for opposing the bill.

Schlissel 
expressed 

concern the tax cuts would 
prevent 
universities 
from 

providing higher education 
at a manageable cost for 
families across the state. He 
also said the proposal would 
negatively affect community 
infrastructure.

“Our fear is that if the 

resources available to state 
government are constrained 
by such a large tax cut, we 
won’t be able to maintain 
accessibility to a great higher 

education at the same cost 
now,” Schlissel said to the 
Detroit Free Press. “Families 
are already struggling to pay 
for college, and we don’t want 
to 
make 
those 
challenges 

greater. It’s not just higher 
ed, it’s community colleges, 
it’s schools, it’s infrastructure 
we’ve promised our fellow 
citizens we’re going to take 
care of. It’s the aid we return 
to our cities that allows them 
to provide services to our 
fellow citizens.”

According to the Detroit 

Free Press, Gov. Rick Snyder 
had also expressed concern 
over the original tax plan and 
the loss of revenue, remarking 
that the situation should be 
researched more thoroughly.

“The governor is always 

open 
to 
new 
ideas 
and 

welcomes the discussion on 
tax reform,” Anna Heaton, 

Snyder’s 
press 
secretary, 

told the Free Press. “For this 
particular proposal, there 
would need to be concrete 
data to demonstrate that 
there is adequate revenue 
from sources besides the 
income 
tax 
to 
ensure 

services for residents and 
investing in our statewide 
infrastructure would not be 
adversely affected.”

In 
a 
press 
release 

following the announcement 
of 
the 
change 
Synder 

expressed his pleasure with 
the change.

“I appreciate that House 

leadership took seriously 
my concerns about the long-
term impact of the proposal, 
but I still have a billion 
dollars worth of concerns 
because there has been no 
plan presented as to how 
this will affect residents 
and 
their 
communities 

statewide.”

Last week at a trail leading into 

Nichols Arboretum, University of 

Michigan medical student Daniel 

Nadelman stumbled upon a dead 

deer. Nadelman told MLive that 

at first glance the deer appeared 

to have been shot as a part of the 

city’s cull from Jan. 30 to Feb. 6. 

However, city officials say it was 

not killed during the cull.

The Ann Arbor cull sparked 

opposition from many residents. 

At a City Council meeting 

last January, many residents 

chanted, “Stop the shoot,” and 

organized a number of protests 

and demonstrations against the 

planned shoot. The latest cull 

removed 96 deer from parks 

and nature areas on University 

properties, with an additional 

54 female deer being sterilized, 

according to an article on the city 

of Ann Arbor’s website.

The remaining carcass 

appeared to be partially eaten, 

according to Nadelman. Tom 

Crawford, Ann Arbor’s chief 

financial officer, who oversaw the 

deer cull, said each deer killed 

during the cull was removed last 

Thursday, leading him to believe 

this one died of other causes.

Because of the dead deer’s 

proximity to the train tracks, it 

might have been hit by a train, yet 

other possibilities still remain. 

The deer could also have been 

attacked by a predator or shot by 

an outsider.

Nadelman also speculated 

this was the same doe he had 

seen before in the Arb with three 

fawns.

“Several months ago, three 

fawns were born in the Arboretum 

and I watched them with their 

mother every day until the hunt 

began,” Nadelman said in the 

MLive article.

coming from Congressional 
Republicans. 
They 
said 
if 

the ACA is repealed, it will 
need to be replaced; however, 
lawmakers have yet to bring 
forth a definitive plan for 
replacement.

“In the last year, we’ve 

heard discussion of increasing 
premium costs and higher 
deductibles, and we do need 
to worry about that, there’s no 
question about it,” Dingell said. 
“There are a lot of statistics 
and numbers but we need to 
know what the facts are, we 
need to understand.”

Laurie 
Burchett, 
an 

insurance 
specialist 
at 

University 
Health 
Service, 

stated that for students who 
obtain an illness that needs 
to be treated at an outside 
facility, health insurance is a 
requirement. She has found, 
however, that many students 
at the University do not have 
their own health insurance 
and 
cannot 
receive 
this 

treatment. She continued by 
explaining that the portion 
of the ACA that allows young 
adults to stay on their parent’s 
health insurance until age 26 is 
crucial for college students.

Claire Fitzgerald, a senior 

majoring in political science, 
gender and health studies and 
business, was also a member 
of the panel. She described 
her experiences as a college 
student and how the ACA 
has affected her and her 
classmates.

“For college students in 

particular, the ACA gives us 
the ability to receive access 
to 
contraceptive 
provision, 

preventive 
sexual 
health 

care and the mental health 
support and flu shots we need 
in a crucial and tumultuous 
time without worrying about 
obtaining coverage outside our 
parents’ plan,” she said.

Fitzgerald 
recalled 
a 

time when she contracted 
mononucleosis and had to 
be hospitalized for a week. 
She said if she were not able 
to be on her parent’s health 
insurance, paying for the large 
hospital bills would have been 
extremely difficult.

Panelists 
also 
described 

how women in particular are 
affected by the ACA, as they 
are provided contraceptives, 
prenatal care, mammograms 
and several other preventative 
screenings.

When moderators opened 

the floor to the audience, 
many attendees had questions 
regarding what they could do as 
individuals to advocate for the 
ACA. Panelist Michael Budros, 
a Rackham student, stressed 
the importance of outreach 
and 
education, 
especially 

toward those who may not 
understand the entirety of the 
current situation.

He said there are many 

people 
who 
have 
health 

insurance 
under 
the 
ACA 

without realizing it and at the 
same time hold a disdain for 
the legislation under its more 
common name, “Obamacare.”

“Don’t underestimate the 

power of talking to your 
friends and families, especially 

people who live in different 
areas,” he said. “They might 
know that they’re benefiting 
from the Affordable Care Act 
but hate Obamacare.”

Dingell stressed situations 

surrounding 
controversial 

issues like the ACA should not 
be made political. She said in 
cases that affect the well-being 
of citizens, public health is not 
a matter of political ideologies.

“This isn’t a partisan fight, 

it’s about real people’s lives,” 
she said. “There are a lot of 
people that are just scared to 
death about what’s going to 
happen to them, so that’s why 
I am so concerned about this 
because this isn’t a political 
game, it’s real people’s lives, 
and that’s why it does matter 
and it is so important.”

LSA freshman Kieran Byrne 

attended the panel as a member 
of a younger generation that 
has seen the ACA in action 
for the majority of their lives, 
and who hasn’t personally 
experienced any major effects 
from other health care plans. 
He explained the importance of 
students from this generation 
attending panels such as this 
one and educating themselves 
on issues that could change 
very quickly in the near future.

“I 
think 
it’s 
important 

that people have a good idea 
of what’s going on in terms 
of 
the 
legislation 
that’s 

going to happen and what 
laws are already doing for 
us,” he said. “I think a lot 
of news and information is 
very sensationalized and it’s 
important to hear from the 
people who actually have an 
impact.”

DINGELL
From Page 1A

identifying … to this day, they 
are still regarded as white. So 
basically, we don’t have a count 
on how many Arab Americans 
or Middle East Americans exist 
in the United States, we don’t 
know how many exist in the 
University of Michigan.”

Public Policy junior Nadine 

Jawad, who serves as senior 
policy adviser to CSG, stressed 
the importance of having a 
record of how many ME/NA 
students there are on campus 
to allocate resources toward 
that community and reach out 
to members.

“When something goes on on 

campus, if we want to connect 
with Arab American students, 
Middle Eastern students, or 
Middle 
Eastern 
and 
North 

African students and people 
identifying in this category, 
it’s very hard to reach out to a 
population of people that you 
don’t even know where they 
are, how many exist on this 
campus,” Jawad said. “If we 
want to advocate for resources 
for our community, it’s very 
hard to because we don’t have 
a breakdown of how many 
students there are so it makes 
it hard to allocate resources for 
this demographic of people on 
campus.”

LSA junior Jad Elharake 

said with all of the talk of 
representation and outreach 
from 
students 
and 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

administration, it is important 
to have an idea of how many 
ME/NA 
students 
are 
on 

campus.

“This will be our third year 

planning a graduation for ME/
NA students, and when we’re 
trying to reach out to students 
and graduates and seniors, 
there isn’t a Listserv we can go 
to, so we have to go by student 
organizations 
or 
friends,” 

Elharake said. “Just to show 
you how dysfunctional it is … I 
know we talk about access and 
outreach and representation 
amongst FSAs (faculty, staff 
and administrators), but we 
don’t even know how many of 

us are on campus.”

Jones 
said 
the 
authors 

hoped 
to 
see 
student 

government support for the 
resolution before approaching 
administration 
and 
sending 

the resolution to University 
President Mark Schlissel.

“All you’re being asked to 

do is show support for this — 
you’re not asked to actually 
create the box, you’re not asked 
the logistics of the box,” he 
said. “It’s basically going to be 
in the racial category, when 
applying to anything or under 
distinctions, so there would 
be a separate ethnic category 
where 
you 
could 
identify 

distinctions. This is primarily 
a racial category we are looking 
to implement, and you would 
just be supporting the idea.”

The 
resolution 
passed 

unanimously 
among 
the 

assembly.

Engineering 
freshman 

Mario Galindez, a member 
of the Engineering Student 
Government, proposed another 
resolution during the meeting 
to support an academic holiday 
on Election Day.

He referred to the long 

lines students had to wait in 
on Election Day, and specified 
these as being a potential factor 
in discouraging students to 
vote.

The resolution proposed an 

academic holiday for Election 
Day 
2020 
and 
all 
even-

numbered years after that. 
The proposal was passed on to 
the resolution committee for 
further review.

to Athletes Connected, an 
initiative to support student-
athlete 
mental 
health 
in 

memory of Garrick Roemer, 
a University student-athlete 
who committed suicide in 
2014.

In an effort to reach out 

to the greater Ann Arbor 
community 
and 
continue 

encouraging 
their 
support 

for treating mental illness, 
the 
organizations 
choose 

Fresh Start Clubhouse, a local 
organization that helps adults 
in the Ann Arbor Community 
with 
mental 
illness 
by 

emphasizing 
employment, 

education, 
housing 
and 

wellness programs as their 
2017 beneficiary.

In 
previous 
years, 
the 

event has relied solely on 
the audience to judge the 
performances; however, this 
year, Harbaugh was joined 
by his wife, Sarah Harbaugh, 
and University alum Summer 
Berman, director of Fresh 
Start Clubhouse, behind the 
judges table. 

In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 

show, 
current 
members 

and 
employees 
of 
Fresh 

Start Clubhouse took center 

stage 
to 
be 
recognized 

and gave a performance to 
share 
their 
message 
that 

no one is ever alone. One of 
the 
organization’s 
current 

members shared his personal 
story 
and 
history 
with 

depression and how, with the 
help of Fresh Start Clubhouse, 
he was able to improve his 
quality of life.

In 
response 
to 
the 

performance 
by 
Fresh 

Start 
and 
the 
story 
of 

overcoming depression, the 
Harbaughs offered to match 
every donation made. The 
organization 
received 
a 

standing ovation.

Co-host 
Drake 
Johnson, 

a fifth-year senior running 
back, shared how important 
he felt the issue of mental 
health for student-athletes 
and the fervor he has to be 
a part of a community that 
supports it.

“As an athlete, it’s very 

critical that we recognize 
how important our mental 
health is,” Johnson said. “Not 
even in just our performance 
but as people. I’m proud to be 
a part of this place because 
you’re not going to find this 
support everywhere.”

To continue the theme of 

mental health awareness, the 
women’s field hockey team 
dedicated its performance to 

“those who felt they didn’t 
have a message.” The team 
lined the stages with signs of 
the lyrics to Adele’s “Make 
You Feel My Love,” as a 
member of the team sang the 
song.

Afterward, 
Harbaugh 

expressed his admiration for 
the team’s performance.

“Talent, 
presentation 

and a compelling message,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Women’s 

field hockey is in it to win it.”

Other teams went with 

more 
conventional 
talent 

show acts such as lip-syncing 
and choreographed dances. 
The men’s gymnastics team 
did a hip-hop dance routine, 
which was well received by 
Harbaugh.

“I thought it was dope,” 

Harbaugh said.

After the judges delegated, 

first-place 
went 
to 
a 
tie 

between 
the 
University’s 

dance team and Fresh Start 
Clubhouse.

Cheer team member Bailey 

Hedman, an LSA sophomore, 
came out to help fundraise for 
mental health after finding 
out about the event from her 
team.

“I know one of our captains 

is a really big supporter of 
this,” Hedman said. “So, the 
whole cheer team is here to 
support.”

with the design of the Atrias-
series robot that we have in 
our lab, and then (we) used the 
mathematics to arrive at the 
robot’s design,” he said. “Hence, 
Cassie ended up looking like 
a bird as a result of math, but 
wasn’t designed that way in the 
sense of bio-inspired.”

Grizzle’s 
lab 
will 
be 

programming and testing the 
algorithm to control Cassie, 
in the hopes they can steer 
the 
robot 
toward 
delivery-

based functions. Xingye Da, an 
Engineering graduate student 
who works in Grizzle’s lab, said 
this functionality was designed 
to maneuver through obstacles.

“Cassie 
was 
designed 

for 
carrying 
and 
delivering 

packages,” he said. “In delivering 
a package to the front of your 

home, the robot will probably 
have to climb up the stairs and 
go through other obstacles.”

Da added Cassie would be 

productive in delivering objects 
because of its studier structure, 
which can mitigate the amount of 
damage coming from collisions 
and falls.

Cassie’s 
functions 
surpass 

those of older robots: Grizzle’s 
current 
robot, 
MARLO, 
is 

another biped that “walks,” but 
it requires human assistance to 
stand up and maneuver its path. 
Moreover, Cassie is designed 
to be able to reorient its “feet,” 
which makes it able to turn in 
its course of action — a function 
MARLO lacks.

“The models for MARLO and 

Cassie were designed for outdoor 
walking, so the biggest challenge 
for MARLO is that it’s very heavy 
and when we take it to the place 
where no mobile gantry can 
work, like the Michigan Wave 
Field or the woods ... we have to 
carry it on a boom to support its 
weight in case it falls,” Grizzle 
said. “Cassie does not need this 
and is more durable.”

Along with this engineered 

mobility, 
Cassie 
is 
set 
to 

transform energy efficiency in 
robots. Da explained robots, 
compared to humans, are very 
inefficient in terms of expending 
energy.

“Compared to humans’ energy 

efficiency, MARLO is five times 
less 
efficient 
than 
humans 

whereas other robots are 100 
times less efficient,” he said. “I 
expect Cassie will be even more 
efficient than MARLO because 
of its lighter weight.”

Da 
expects 
this 
energy 

efficiency to be a main feature 
of Cassie. He explained per 
its design for the outdoors, 
conserving 
energy 
will 
be 

a necessity for carrying out 
missions.

“If you think about doing 

outdoor exploring or rescue, the 
biggest concern is the battery 
life,” he said. “If you carry more 
power, of course you’ll end up 
weighing heavier, so there’s a 
tradeoff. But Cassie was designed 
to counter this.”

Cassie, 
along 
with 
other 

bipedal robots, was designed 
to harness a variety of human 
mobility. 
Dmitry 
Berenson, 

assistant professor of electrical 
engineering 
and 
computer 

science, predicted future robots 
will integrate more humanoid-
type parts.

“Cassie is a pair of legs, but 

to do useful things you would 
need some way to interact 
with the world (with arms),” 
Berenson said. “It’s good to 
develop arm and leg capabilities 
independently so we can focus 
on the core problems of each. 
However, we’re moving toward 
a point where both technologies 
are maturing and need to be 
integrated into a full humanoid 
system.”

problematic to the point where 
I think it would almost be better 
if it weren’t passed, because 
some of the exceptions in it I 
think are very dangerous.”

Along with several other 

residents 
at 
the 
meeting, 

Councilmember Jack Eaton (D–
Ward 4) agreed the language of 
the exceptions in the ordinance 
needed to be revised.

“I find great substance to 

the objections that were raised 
by residents of the city,” he 
said. “I’ve spoken to the city 
attorney’s office regarding this, 

and in consultation with them, 
I will be working out a better 
way to describe any exception 
we will make for this.”

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) said 
she 
understood 
residents’ 

concerns with the exceptions, 
but pointed out the council was 
balancing multiple priorities 
with 
the 
ordinance. 
She 

specifically noted the federal 
funding that goes toward public 
housing for the city’s low-
income residents, which could 
be threatened by the passing of 
such an ordinance.

“None 
of 
us 
here 
have 

any doubt that the current 
president is a very vindictive 
person,” she said. “Some of you 

have pleaded with us, asking 
us why don’t we just declare 
ourselves a sanctuary city and 
then go fight it out in the courts, 
because it’s a just war. And I do 
agree with you, but the issue is 
we come from a middle-class 
perspective where we have a 
safety net. The people who live 
in public housing are not in the 
safety net. They don’t have any 
other safety net.”

Kailasapathy said the city 

currently receives $1.25 million 
per month from the federal 
government in public housing 
grants. 
Councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D–Ward 
3) noted the funds provide 
housing for more than 1,300 
Ann Arbor residents.

the substituted bill will be 
voted on — less than a week 
after the committee’s hearing 
for the initial bill.

To reach the income tax level 

of 3.9 percent, the new bill, 
which will take effect Jan. 1, 
2018, would reduce the income 
tax by 0.1 percent each year for 
three years — for the fourth 
year, it would be lowered by 0.05 
percent.

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–

Ann Arbor) remarked that he 
thinks both the initial proposal 
and this new plan will negatively 

affect the state.

“I think that the Republican 

tax proposal and its amendment 
are both fiscally irresponsible to 
the state and the wrong move for 
us to make — it’s irresponsible to 
talk about cutting income to the 
state,” he said. “That’s hundreds 
of millions of dollars coming out 
of police and fire departments, 
coming out of schools.”

HISTORY IN THE M AKING

We’re moving 
toward a point 

where both 

technologies are 

maturing


O

n Friday, Feb. 10, I saw a 
beautiful 
performance 

by the Budapest Festival 

Orchestra at Hill Auditorium. 
Before 
the 
show 

began, as I looked 
around at the sea of 
gray, elderly audience 
members surrounding 
me, 
I 
saw 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
president 

of the University of 
Michigan, sitting in the 
level below me.

On 
the 
previous 

night, I had attended 
a 
sit-in 
protest 
at 

the 
Michigan 
Union, 

organized by Students4Justice. 
As part of the protest, S4J wrote 
up a list of demands that it wants 
the administration to meet. The 
first demand reads as follows: 
“Acknowledge our humanity and 
address us-- Muslim, Jewish, 
Black, 
Arab, 
LGBTQ+, 
and 

other 
marginalized 
students 

on campus-- in person on 
Thursday, February 9, 2017 at 
the Michigan Union.”

Several administrators came 

and met with the organizers of the 
protest. But Schlissel never came. 
I was surprised that Schlissel did 
not attend this event, especially 
since the demands being made 
were very basic and fundamental: 
Recognize us, see us, treat us 
with the respect that human 
beings deserve.

And I’d like to deliberate 

here why Schlissel might not 
have attended the protest, a 
well-publicized 
event 
that 

attracted students, faculty and 
administrators alike. I saw a 
video of Schlissel confronting 
protesters, who were angry about 
the spate of racist and anti-Semitic 
emails, 
and 
the 
subsequent 

lack of a concrete, immediate 
administrative response, outside 
of his home the night before the 
sit-in at the Union. And in that 
confrontation, Schlissel said, “I 
feel helpless.”

So perhaps it is this helplessness 

that renders you silent, that 
kept you invisible on the night 
of a student protest and sitting 
in luxury seating at a classical 
musical concert on the very next 
night. Schlissel feels “helpless” 
to the demands being made by 
activist groups on campus.

President Schlissel, if I can 

address you here, you ought to 
know that you are not alone. Your 
students who make demands of 
you also feel helpless. And it is not 
actually an option for you to feel 
helpless and then to subsequently 
refuse to meet with the very 
students who are calling for 

change. That’s like me, as a young 
boy, crying because I’m hungry 
but then refusing to eat the food 
my parents give me. You cannot 

have it both ways. You 
cannot feel helpless 
and then refuse to 
engage your students, 
who know best what 
it means to live on 
this campus. They 
are the people who 
can help you feel 
less helpless. Their 
demand 
that 
you 

meet with them is 
an offer to help you 

feel less helpless, to 

help you take tangible actions 
to push our University forward.

Schlissel’s 
general 

unresponsiveness reminds me 
of something Angela Davis, 
the renowned revolutionary 
prison abolitionist and civil 
rights leader, once said. Davis 
was 
asked 
about 
violence 

within the Black nationalist 
movement. 
The 
reporter 

suggested that violence was the 
only way to achieve the goals 
stipulated by the movement. 
And Davis responded:

“When 
you 
talk 
about 
a 

revolution, most people think 
‘violence,’ without realizing that 
the real content of any kind of 
revolutionary thrust lies in the 
principles and the goals that 
you’re striving for, not in the way 
you reach them. On the other 
hand, because of the way this 
society’s organized, because of the 
violence that exists on the surface 
everywhere, you have to expect 
that there are going to be such 
explosions. You have to expect 
things like that as reactions. If 
you are a Black person and live 
in the Black community all your 
life, and walk out on the street 
every day seeing white policemen 
surrounding you. … And then 
you ask me, you know, whether I 
approve of violence, I mean that 
just doesn’t make any sense at all.”

In other words, Davis is saying 

one should not be surprised 
at violence perpetrated by the 
movement when violence has 
been perpetrated by the police 
and by the dominant white society 
against Black and brown societies 
for centuries in the United States. 
Violence is the norm. To only 
criticize it when it is perpetrated 
by Davis and her colleagues is 
racist and willfully ignorant.

And in this passage, too, 

Davis defines precisely the flaw 
in Schlissel’s refusal to respond 
to 
demands: 
Davis 
criticizes 

her interviewer for assuming 
violence comes only from the 

Black nationalists and not from 
the white supremacist United 
States 
government. 
Similarly, 

the idea that demands do not 
start a conversation presupposes 
that there are other options for 
these students to be taking up. It 
presupposes a sort of absolute 
innocence on the part of the 
administration, as if it has done 
nothing to perpetrate the need 
for demands.

Of 
course, 
these 
students 

understand that a demand is 
different from a request, from 
setting up a meeting with the 
president like other students — 
those students, for example, who 
do not feel as if their lives are 
threatened and their humanity 
silenced — might do. These 
students know what a demand is 
and their lived experience informs 
why demands are necessary.

Schlissel’s logic, then, does 

not even attempt to understand 
why demands must be made, 
why his students feel as if his 
administration does not recognize 
their humanity. Instead, you shy 
away from the demands, as if 
they aren’t necessary. As if these 
students ought to feel, of course, 
that a normal, egalitarian, calm 
conversation can happen.

So 
I 
ask 
you, 
President 

Schlissel, what reason has your 
office given these students to 
feel that way? What tangible, 
in-person, 
immediate 
action 

have you taken to defend these 
students? For example, you have 
not addressed police brutality 
in this country and you have not 
addressed that this might affect 
the experience and the perceived 
safety of marginalized students 
on this campus. You have not 
made your solidarity with these 
marginalized students publicly 
known; so, in turn, when activists 
literally came to your doorstep 
just to get you to make some 
public statement, to force you 
hand, you responded with a 
pathetic, hapless declaration of 
your own helplessness. 

And then, on the next night, 

when 
students, 
faculty 
and 

administrators protested at the 
Union, you were nowhere to be 
seen. What kind of a leader — 
specifically as someone who has 
repeatedly declared yourself to be 
a relentless advocate for diversity, 
equity and inclusion — disappears 
as your students march, sit and 
advocate their humanity? 

Please listen to your students. 

That is all.

N

atasha Bedingfield’s song 
“Pocketful of Sunshine” 
has unfailingly gotten 

me 
through 
many 

stressful situations I 
have experienced in 
my 18 years of living. 
Whether I was having 
a tough day at school, 
didn’t want to go 
to work or was in a 
fight with a friend, its 
melody always put me 
in a better mood that 
would keep me from 
exploding inside.

Recently, 
I’ve 

found that I haven’t had the same 
opportunities I once did to dance 
around and belt Bedingfield’s 
liberating words “take me away.” 
It is hard to find time to be alone, 
totally and completely in solitude, 
when 
living 
with 
400-plus 

freshman students in a college 
dorm. I was forced to welcome 
a new home that is incredibly 
different from my old home 42 
miles away.

Going into college, I thought 

I was prepared for it all. I knew 
the campus, the students and the 
culture. I was ready to come to 
school and get away from my life 
at home. I have found that one 
of the biggest challenges no one 
explicitly prepares you for is living 
in the dorms. College was my first 
time living away from home, and I 
had no idea all it would entail.

At 
college, 
the 
ability 
to 

separate school from home life 
gets increasingly difficult, and I 
find myself constantly thinking 
about classwork. I go home to 
people I go to school with and 
wake up next to them just to do it 
all again. Constantly living around 
people who can observe and hear 
my every move leaves little time 
for me to truly be myself, as I am 
constantly conscious of my actions 
and how they will resonate with 
the people who live in such close 
proximity to me.

No longer do I have time to 

come home, sit on the couch 

and watch TV. I am constantly 
moving and thinking about what 
assignment to do next. I pack my 

bag in the morning, 
knowing I won’t return 
until late at night. Then 
by 2 p.m., when all I 
want to do is watch an 
episode of “Friends” 
and relax, I am still 
sitting uncomfortably 
at the coffee shop table 
where I have been 
cemented for the last 
four hours. No longer 
can I shower alone in 
the bathroom, and I 

have to leave my “house” to get 
lunch. 

The transition from home life 

to dorm life can be a struggle that 
many students think they’ll know 
how to handle before coming to 
college, but it is hard to anticipate 
all the changes living in a dorm 
will bring. This struggle that 
many freshmen face is something 
that is not always recognized but 
is nonetheless valid.

I am struggling to find time 

to be in solitude. It is hard to 
always go home to someone in 
the room or someone down the 
hall. For me, being comfortable 
in any space is something that I 
value wholeheartedly. I long for 
moments when I can belt show 
tunes without any thought that I 
am disrupting others.

The experiences that I have had 

with communal living have taught 
me to truly never be embarrassed 
for who I am and what I am 
interested in. And, no, I still can’t 
bring myself to sing in the shower 
when I know other people are in 
there, but I commend the people 
who do. I am proud of the girl 
who showers to Beethoven, and 
definitely could learn a few things 
from her.

I have said it before and I will 

say it again: College is a growing 
experience. Having the ability to 
adapt to certain situations in this 
first transitional year is really 
something to be proud of yourself 

for. It is hard to move to a place 
you are unfamiliar with and have 
to find new outlets for expressing 
yourself because the resources are 
vastly different here.

Next year, I will have my own 

room, in an apartment with 
friends I know and love, and will 
be comfortable belting Natasha 
Bedingfield, even if they don’t 
appreciate it. The difference is 
that when you are surrounded 
by people whom you are familiar 
with, you are more comfortable in 
expressing who you are, no matter 
who that may be. The challenge of 
sharing a space with individuals 
you don’t know or share interests 
or backgrounds with is tough. It’s 
during these moments when I stop 
myself from singing Bedingfield’s 
catchy tunes and hum the lyrics 
quietly so only I can hear that I 
realize this struggle.

Living in a dorm presents 

freshmen 
with 
a 
unique 

opportunity to constantly be 
surrounded by their classmates. 
This 
often 
underestimated 

transition has presented me with 
lots of challenges that I thought 
I was prepared for. The struggle 
of moving away from home is 
often brushed off by the fact 
that students come to college to 
further their schooling. There is 
no way to be successful if we are 
not first comfortable in their living 
situation, which I have found 
to be the hardest adjustment. I 
think we should cherish these 
moments where we are constantly 
surrounded 
by 
others, 
and 

immerse ourselves in situations 
where we feel most comfortable. 
Finding the environment where I 
truly feel at “home” is going to take 
time, which is something I have 
had to recognize and embrace. 
And I hope that future Wolverines 
and current students know that 
this adjustment is normal and you 
are not alone in this struggle.

S

tudent health and safety is, 
without a doubt, one of the 
most pressing issues for 

students across the country. Rates 
of sexual assault and depression 
remain high: One in five women 
and one in 16 men are sexually 
assaulted during their college 
years, while one in four college 
students 
suffers 
from 
some 

type of mental illness. These 
are concerns that must be on 
all of our radars, regardless of 
the nature of our connection to 
these issues. Simply put, when 
anyone is struggling or is made 
to feel unsafe, that must matter 
to all of us. Our lives are woven 
together, and thus we must not 
be apathetic when a classmate 
or peer of ours suffers.

When we ran for Central 

Student Government president 
and vice president last winter 
semester, 
we 
promised 
to 

work our hardest to utilize the 
organization as a vehicle to 
advance a safer, more inclusive 
campus. More than 10 months 
later, with little more than one 
month remaining in our term, 
we are proud to report on the 
great progress that CSG has 
made in the area of student 
health and safety.

At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 

year, in partnership with the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
and 

LSA Student Government, we 
established hydration stations in 
high-risk areas on the first five 
football Saturdays of the year. 
Additionally, on Sept. 17, 2016, as 
Michigan played Colorado at 3:30 
p.m., we hosted an alcohol-free 
tailgate, serving 1,500 students 
water and pizza throughout the 
afternoon. One goal of ours with 
this event was to provide students 
who might be unable to drink, 
or uninterested in drinking, 
before a football game with an 

alternative option to have fun. 
We also wanted to ensure that 
those who had been drinking had 
the opportunity to eat and stay 
hydrated throughout the day.

During our administration, we 

have likewise worked to advance 
student mental health, an issue 
that has received an increasing 
amount of attention over the 
past few years. In late October, 
we commissioned the first-ever 
CSG Mental Health Climate and 
Resources Task Force which is 
composed of nearly 20 student 
leaders 
from 
mental-health-

focused 
organizations 
across 

campus. The task force’s central 
goal is to draft and present to us 
a set of policy recommendations 
that will help to destigmatize 
mental illness, better the climate in 
classrooms and expand resources 
for both faculty and students. 
The task force will release its 
report shortly after Spring Break 
and we will work with the task 
force’s leaders and the University 
of Michigan administration over 
the next weeks and months to 
implement these suggestions.

To 
aid 
sexual 
violence 

prevention and awareness, we 
empowered University students 
to receive bystander intervention 
training about sexual violence and 
alcohol and other drug misuse. 
At the end of last semester, we 
launched a highly successful pilot 
funding policy that requires any 
student organization seeking to 
claim more than $1,000 from 
CSG’s 
Student 
Organization 

Funding Commission to send 
at least two authorized signers 
to one SAPAC- and Wolverine 
Wellness-led 
bystander 

intervention training. More than 
215 student leaders from 100-
plus student organizations have 
already completed the training. 
Going forward, we must ensure 

that students are receiving this 
education not just during their 
first few weeks on campus, but 
throughout their college career. 
We believe that this policy is a step 
in that direction.

This year, we’ve also committed 

CSG to addressing sexual assault 
prevention at the K-12 level. On 
Feb. 22, alongside students from 
Michigan State University, CSG 
is coordinating an advocacy day, 
the purpose of which is to meet 
with Michigan state officials to 
advocate for the implementation 
of a sexual education curriculum 
that 
encompasses 
sexual 

harassment and assault in public 
schools. We believe that a stronger 
K-12 sexual education curriculum 
is one way in which we can help 
reduce these high rates of sexual 
misconduct on college campuses.

Overall, we are both proud of 

the strides that our administration 
has made in the area of student 
health and safety and cognizant 
that much work still needs to 
be done. It will be up to future 
CSG administrations to lead the 
unending fight against alcohol and 
other drug misuse, the stigma 
around mental illness and the 
high rates of sexual assault. It is 
our hope that they will expand 
the bystander intervention policy 
that we set in motion, work 
to implement the task force’s 
recommendations and expand 
the scope of CSG’s state-level 
advocacy about K-12 consent-
based education, among other 
important initiatives. The work to 
holistically elevate student health 
and safety, of course, also falls to 
the individual student, who must 
continue to lead by example and 
forever exercise safe behavior.

Carlton on work, future

A thousand miles later, the singer-songwriter is all grown up

After 16 years, six major 

releases 
and 
a 
nod 
from 

Billboard, the Grammys and 
the AMAs, Vanessa Carlton 
refuses to slow down. She’s 
only getting better, really. The 
singer-songwriter known for 
“A Thousand Miles” may have 
made a purposeful exit from 
the mainstream 
stage, 
but 

Carlton has never 
ceased to gain 
ground; she has 
found her sound 
and 
navigates 

the 
stage 
and 

studio 
with 

surefootedness.

“There 
are 
people 
who 

know 
‘A 
Thousand 
Miles’ 

cause everyone seems to know 
that song, of course … but it’s 
16 years old, so if you were to 
hear a record of mine now, you 
can tell I’m that pianist but it’s 
a different sound,” said singer-
songwriter Vanessa Carlton.

In 
a 
phone 
interview, 

Carlton mused on the makings 
of her latest releases, Earlier 
Things Live and Liberman 
(Live), while touching on the 
arc of her prolific career and 
upcoming tour.

“It was probably the easiest 

way of doing a record I had 
ever 
experienced,” 
Carlton 

said, when asked about the 
process behind her first live 
record. “It was the last show 
on tour in Nashville one night, 
and it was a good night and 
we captured it. People who 
don’t know much about me or 
my life or what I’m doing now 
who haven’t seen a live show, 
(Liberman [Live]) is a good 
record to get.” 

Nodding to her now-veteran 

singer-songwriter 
status, 

Carlton confessed it took time 
for her to build up the self-
assurance to do a live album.

“Over the years I really have 

been able to evoke more of a 
vocal confidence and sound, 
and I’m glad I waited so long,” 
Carlton said.

Coming hot off of Liberman 

(Live), Carlton also released 
an EP, Earlier Things Live. The 
short record is a compilation 
of older songs from that same 
magical Nashville night that 
bore Liberman (Live). When 
asked to explain her drive to 
compile a separate EP, Carlton 
expelled the virtues of vinyl 
and the power of choice and 
authenticity it brings to the 
digital streaming age.

“Either you’re streaming 

all 
the 
time 

or 
you’re 
into 

buying 
actual 

vinyl 
records 

which is higher 
sound 
quality 

it 
is 
better,” 

Carlton 
said. 

“I think people 

understand that medium no 
matter how old you are. It is 
a superior sound, so I wanted 
there to be different products 
for my followers and fans.”

But now that Carlton has 

done due justice to Liberman 
and its beautiful moments, she 
is ready to put on a tour that 
more encapsulating — one 
that reflects her breadth as an 
artist.

“I’m going to do some 

older songs and some songs 
peppered 
from 
different 

records to create a little bit 
more of variety in the show 
than 
the 
Liberman 
tour,” 

Carlton said. “(We will play) 
songs that we like, songs that 
we want to rearrange, songs 
that haven’t been played in a 
while.”

Though the upcoming tour 

aims to more fully encompass 
Carlton’s 
decade-and-a-half 

long career, her work is not 
impervious to the stressors 
of the present day. Touching 
on the tense socio-political 
climate, Carlton spoke of the 
essential role that art plays in 
bringing people together. 

“Right now, I’m so disturbed 

by what’s happening to civil 
rights in this country and as 
a woman reproductive rights 
are really under fire and so 
I feel very protective of my 
daughter and I feel protective 
of the earth and of human 
beings,” Carlton said. “I think 

more than anything ... an 
artist during this time, the 
most valuable place is making 
art and making something 
beautiful 
or 
something 

that can connect people, or 
something that is telling the 
truth about the present day.”

Despite 
her 
personal 

feelings concerning the state 
of the nation, Carlton does 
not plan to make her show a 
political spectacle. Instead, 

embarks on her tour with 
a hope for partnership and 
trust between her and her 
audiences.

“There is a trust that you 

are going to be taken care of 
by the audience and that the 
audience is going to be taken 
care of by the artists, you 
gotta be there for each other,” 
Carlton said. “With every 
tour there’s usually a handful 
of really great feeling shows 
that transcend the typical 
performance 
and 
you 
go 

someplace else.”

It is these moments — these 

instances 
of 
transcendence 

— 
that 
make 
the 
grind 

worthwhile for Carlton, that 
have driven her to break from 
the mechanized pop mold and 
break into her own voice.

“(‘A Thousand Miles’) is 16 

years old, so if you were to hear 
a record of mine now, you can 
tell I’m that pianist but it’s a 
different sound,” Carlton said. 
“I’m still privileged that I’m 
able to have a vibrant career 
doing music and making albums 
in a way that I want to make 
them. I’m not a part of the huge 
machine anymore, I left that … 
and never looked back.”

Daily Arts Writer

In the land of women

In 
many 
ways 
“Julieta” 

noticeably 
lacks 
the 
stylistic 

ticks of its writer/director Pedro 
Almodovar. It’s tame, as far 
as 
Almodovar 
is 

concerned, sticking to 
a simple plot, down-
to-earth 
characters 

and not even a hint of 
singing.

What it does retain is 

Almodovar’s signature 
feature — women. And, 
not just any women, 
real women, some of 
the 
realest 
women 

created 
by 
a 
man 

possibly ever. It’s easy 
— so easy it’s almost boring — to 
find what’s wrong with onscreen 
portrayals of women. What’s much 
more interesting, and cosmically 
reassuring, is looking at all the ways 
Almodovar gets it right.

Almodovar rose to international 

acclaim following his 1988 film 
“Mujeres al borde de un ataque 
de nervios” The film’s title is 
poorly translated into English as 
“Women on the Verge of a Nervous 
Breakdown.” That film, screened in 
my high school Spanish class, was 
my first introduction to Almodovar.

In the film, a web of people 

become 
increasingly 
tangled 

in each other. In classic, almost 
Shakespearian comedy, Pepa loves 
Iván whose son Carlos and his 
fiancé Marisa want to buy Pepa’s 
apartment where she’s trying 
to console Candela, etc. etc. It’s 
hilarious and impossibly confusing. 
In the middle of it all is Pepa, a 
hurricane in the best sense of the 
word. She’s manic and destructive 
and most of all a force.

His latest, “Julieta,” joins a 

portfolio of films that demonstrate 
Almodovar’s keen observation of 
and empathy for the daily suffering 

of the modern woman. The 
central figure, Julieta, is a woman 
defined by loss, first by the death 
of her husband and next by the 

abandonment of her 
daughter. 
Almodovar 

gets 
increasingly 

close to her over the 
course of the film, 
sifting 
through 
the 

nuances of her psyche. 
He understands her 
deeply enough that he 
can visually form her 
with very little spoken 
dialogue 
(the 
film 

was originally called 
“Silence” but the name 

was changed to avoid confusion 
with Scorses’s film of the same 
name).

To Almodovar, it seems, women 

are the fabric that hold the universe 
together. His film “Talk to Her” is 
a perfect example of this. Despite 
being comatose, the two women 
at the center of this film hold it 
together. The other characters 
are reliant to some extent on their 
presence.

Some criticize what they call 

Almodovar’s stylization or even 
fetishization of female suffering, 
something the director seems to 
address in his 1999 Oscar-winning 
film “All About My Mother.” This is 
a common criticism pointed at gay 
men who make art about women.

And yet, empathy and beauty 

are 
not 
mutually 
exclusive. 

Almodovar’s film do not need to be 
come any less beautiful to be real 
and deeply true. His picture of the 
experience of women, painted in 
striking colors and perfectly laid 
out shots, is one steeped in a deep 
understanding of what it means to 
suffer mundanely. It is very easy to 
show Day 1 of grief, Almodovar has 
mastered the art of Day 1001. 

Raised by a strong community 

of women, Almodovar is clearly 
attuned to the ways women 
interact with each other. Themes of 
maternity and sisterhood dominate 
his family dramas.

Part of what sets Almodovar’s 

women 
apart 
from 
other 

cinematic representations is his 
deep understanding of female 
friendship. Contrary to what gal 
pal rom-coms might lead you to 
believe, the backbone of female 
friendship is not two women telling 
each other how much they like each 
other and swapping relationship 
advice in a trendy bar. So much 
of female friendship is unspoken. 
Its essence is in moments like the 
one in which Beatrice helps Antia 
lift her depressed mother from 
the bath. Or when Julieta returns 
to the park where her daughter 
and Beatrice used to play, only to 
discover Beatrice has done the 
same.

Some 
American 
filmmakers 

like Noah Baumbach and Mike 
Mills have captured the parts of 
womanhood that elude so many 
others. 
Baumach’s 
2015 
film 

“Mistress America” examines the 
overlapping nature of sisterhood 
and friendship and Mills’s “20th 
Century Women” examines the 
role three women play in the 
development of a teenage boy. Both 
films capture the empathy and 
tenderness that Almodovar’s films 
exude. 

So it’s not impossible. Male 

filmmakers can put real women 
on the screen. What is takes it 
seems is a simultaneous look 
inward and outward, a close 
examination 
of 
the 
women 

around 
the 
director 
and 
a 

reflection on how they shaped 
the director himself. Almodovar 
is a standout, but he’s not alone.

CONCERT REVIEW
Young the Giant steps up

In 
all 
honesty, 
when 
my 

roommate asked me if I wanted to 
see Young the Giant in concert with 
her, I wasn’t too stoked. I love going 
to alternative concerts, especially 
bands that are not as popular as they 
once were. But I’ve never listened to 
Young the Giant beyond their hits, 
and based on those I didn’t think 
this was going to be anything to 
rave about. Boy, was I wrong.

20 Monroe Live, a new venue 

in Grand Rapids, MI, consisted of 
a general admission pit and a high 
mezzanine. The stage’s backdrop 
was a simple black and grey 
mountain, the same outline of the 
mountain that appears on Young 
the Giant’s Home of the Strange 
album cover. The small flags 
printed on the album cover also 
came to life where six of them hung 
on either side of the stage.

After much waiting, and with 

absolutely no warning, Kanye’s 
“Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 
1” blasted through the venue as 
opener Lewis Del Mar strutted out 
on stage to a roaring welcome. I was 
lost, because I never even heard of 
these guys, but they walked out to 
fucking Kanye, so I had faith.

The moment Danny Miller, lead 

singer and guitarist of the band, 
sang the lyrics, “Can you please 
/ Sit the fuck down,” the crowd, 
including myself, went crazy. And 
with the rest of the set, the audience 
seemed to sing along.

The experimental alternative 

band chose to perform most of 

their album in a screamo style. As 
someone who knows nothing about 
screamo nor Lewis Del Mar, I was 
still highly impressed. Although 
I was later told the group is not 
screamo at all, I was interested in 
listening to their original album.

Cross-pollinating 
acoustic 

instruments, 
like 
the 
guitar, 

woodblocks and sleigh bells, with 
an electric sound, like heavy bass, 
keyboard and electric guitar, Lewis 
Del Mar provided a new sound 
for the audience. They were the 
definition of “a great opener,” and 
immediately took the the spotlight 
for the night.

With 
that, 
I 
had 
high 

expectations for Young the Giant.

The band walked out to fog 

machines 
and 
bright 
lights, 

reflected from the stage and the 
audience. Opening with “Jungle 
Youth,” one of the less popular songs 
off Home of the Strange, the energy 
held at the top, like a rollercoaster 
— but it never dropped. In other 
words, it was uneventful.

Still, the band picked it up with 

crowd favorites “Something To 
Believe In” and “Titus Was Born,” 
which involved a lot of sweet 
harmonies from the band members.

And yes, right in the middle of 

their set, they played the song that 
made them famous: “Cough Syrup.” 
I almost wish they didn’t play it, 
hoping the band would move on 
from the trite hit. But they did, and 
although it might have bugged me, I 
still sang along.

They kept going with some 

older material, including “Mind 
over Matter” and “Apartment,” 
and the crowd raved over these 

hits, feeding into a comradery for 
audience members.

With a mix of high falsetto riffs 

from lead singer Sameer in “Mr. 
Know-It-All” and a deep, ’80s 
groove bass in “Elsewhere,” the 
band began to pick up the intensity, 
or at least kept it varied.

One of the highlights of the entire 

show was when Sameer whipped 
out 
the 
ukulele, 
introducing 

the nostalgic and mystical “Art 
Exhibit.”

With a single spotlight on him, 

Sameer said: “This song is about 
how memories warp and change.” 
It allowed the crowd to relate to 
his nostalgia, especially as the set 
background turned into a simple 
starry night sky.

The 
band 
returned 
with 

the second half of their upbeat 
set, 
including 
“Amerika” 
and 

“Silvertounge,” 
which 
were 

accompanied by intense technicolor 
lighting.

And of course, the band couldn’t 

leave their concert without their 
hit “My Body,” which I will admit, 
I was less moody about. There 
was a type of refreshing freedom 
and adolescence that came with 
it, allowing me to wrap my arms 
around my roommates as we belted 
the lyrics to the song of our early 
teens.

There 
were 
elements 
to 

Young the Giant’s concert that 
were lackluster. But their sound, 
their combination of different 
instruments and their diverse set 
list proved my pre-notioned ideas 
wrong. They are unique, and they 
are truly embedded within their 
own category of music.

History, myth & ‘Neruda’

20TH CENTURY FOX

“I 
don’t 
smoke,” 
Jackie 

Kennedy 
whispers 
to 
the 

journalist writing a profile on 
her as she exhales a cool puff of 
smoke in Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie.” 
Larraín’s English-language debut 
examined Jackie Kennedy as both 
woman and image 
in the aftermath 
of her husband’s 
assassination. Her 
words 
here 
are 

an 
assertion 
of 

power, an attempt 
to control the story that will be 
crafted and the memory that will 
be perpetuated. Along with Jackie 
herself, Larraín’s film meditates 
on the methods by which history 
is made, by which men and 
women of flesh and blood become 
figures of paper and ink.

“Neruda,” Larraín’s feature 

about the Chilean poet and 
politician (Luis Gnecco, “Narcos”) 
is an unconventional biopic of an 
altogether different nature. And 
once again the focus is on the 
relationship 
between 
history 

and myth. It begins in 1948, as 
Chilean democracy descends into 
dictatorship and the conservative 
government cracks down on its 
communist opposition. Neruda 
is, of course, the most famous 
of Chile’s communists and the 
party’s most prominent figure in 
the Senate. Faced with jail, exile 
or hiding, he chooses the latter 

and leaves his upper-class life 
— far away, despite his rhetoric, 
from the trials of the workers — 
which consists of poetry during 
the day and parties at night.

In flight from the government 

police, Neruda strides across 
Chile like a Colossus, and the 
detective Oscar Peluchonneau 
(Gael Garcia Bernal, “Mozart in 
the Jungle”) scurries after him, 

like a mouse at his 
feet. Peluchonneau 
narrates 
the 

action 
of 
the 

film, 
frequently 

castigating Neruda 
for his bourgeois 

excesses yet admiring his poetic 
gifts. The chase covers over a 
year, during which Neruda writes 
his epic poem “Canto General,” 
the early drafts of which are 
clandestinely 
distributed 

throughout the world.

Whereas Jackie is the center of 

her film’s universe, Neruda shares 
the spotlight with Peluchonneau. 
Indeed, the tension between the 
two provides all of the drama. At 
every hiding spot, Neruda leaves 
a potboiler detective novel for 
Peluchonneau to pick up, at once 
teasing him and encouraging his 
hunt. The investigator seems to 
be a character plucked out of one 
of these books, a man hapless 
and 
delusional, 
who 
stakes 

professional glory on a case that 
he hasn’t the skill to complete.

The film is less a rumination on 

Neruda’s place in Chilean history 
than a political thriller that prods 

and ironizes his aggrandization 
by both himself and others. As 
the film goes on, Peluchonneau 
realizes that he will not capture 
Neruda but mythologize him, that 
he is an invention made for this 
very purpose. As Neruda’s wife 
Delia del Carril (Mercedes Morán, 
“Motorcycle Diaries”) tells him, 
he is just a supporting character 
in the life of the great poet.

Yet the film is never this simple. 

Larraín’s Neruda is hardly a 
gilded monument. He is, without 
a doubt, a man: Impetuous, loving, 
charming, arrogant, stubborn. He 
has no reservations about drinking 
or adultery, spending a not 
insignificant amount of time, even 
in hiding, at a brothel. He is tender 
and cruel, self-aggrandizing and 
a man of the people. He’s packed 
with contradictions.

Eventually, 
after 
months 

of 
running, 
Neruda 
and 

Peluchonneau 
meet 
in 
the 

southern Andes. Peluchonneau 
lies dying, after being hit in the 
head with a large tree branch by 
the employees of the landowner 
who housed Neruda for a night. 
His blood glazes the bright snow. 
The infamous man meets the 
forgotten. And the film seems to 
wonder: Who has made who?

Larraín’s film doesn’t have 

any easy answers. Rather than 
explain the meaning of Neruda’s 
legacy, it prods the complexities 
of how history is created and 
proliferated, and the result is, 
once again, a film as strange and 
compelling as its subject.

‘Doubt’ on uncertain start

CBS

The premise behind CBS’s 

newest series, “Doubt,” is an 
interesting 
concept, 
but 
one 

without passion or conviction. The 
series follows renowned lawyers 
Sadie (Katherine Heigl, “Grey’s 
Anatomy”) and Albert (Dulé 
Hill, “Psych”) as they work to 
prove that pediatric 
neurosurgeon 
(Steven 
Pasquale, 

“Rescue 
Me”) 
is, 

beyond a reasonable 
doubt, 
completely 

innocent of a crime 
committed 25 years 
prior. 
However, 

pathos clashes with 
professionalism when Sadie finds 
herself falling for the convicted, a 
fact that is especially chilling when 
she admits a startling truth — her 
lack of certainty that Billy did not 
commit the crime with which he 
stands accused.

One of the downsides of 

“Doubt” is the obvious struggle 
that Hill and Heigl face when it 
comes to falling out of old habits. 
Albert (Dulé Hill, “Psych”) is 
overly serious, to the point that 
his humor feels forced and out of 
context — highly reminiscent of 
his time on long-running comedy 
series “Psych.” It seems like 
Heigl struggles with breaking 
the mold as well, pushing her 
“Grey’s Anatomy” character to 
the forefront of her performance. 
In her role as a surgical resident, 
Heigl played up the flawed and 
emotional doctor, unable to make 
it through an episode without 
letting her emotions overtake 
her priorities as a professional. 
As a lawyer, she owes the public 
and family of the victim closure, 
something that is done in a 

professional manner — however, 
justice doesn’t hold a place for 
emotional connections between 
the convicted and their defenders. 
Adding in a jailed mother, and 
Sadie is mirror image of Heigl’s 
previous role, in both mannerisms 
and inflections alike. Heigl still 
commands a scene, not in the 
conventional manner, but instead 
with 
over-the 
top 
emotional 

context, reminding viewers in a 

recurring 
and 

uncomfortable 
manner of her 
humanity. This is 
quite unfortunate 
for 
“Doubt,” 

which has created 
a 
character 

who, 
perhaps 

developed for a 

specific role, comes off as flat and 
unoriginal.

The development of a unique 

personality is not the only thing 
that “Doubt” struggles with in 
separating itself from series of 
a similar nature. Though there 
are not many facets of Sadie’s 
personality that are standoutish 
— a young, independent woman 
who is eco-conscious and friends 
with her co-workers — the minor 
characters of “Doubt” are truly 
generic. In fact, it often feels 
as though, in developing an 
overstuffed plot and focusing 
too heavily on introductions, 
the writers neglected to award 
a personality to these members 
of the cast. For a more obvious 
example of this neglect, one should 
look no further than resident 
dumb blonde Tiffany (Dreama 
Walker, “Don’t Trust the B---- in 
Apartment 23”), who continuously 
reminds viewers that just because 
she’s from Iowa doesn’t mean 
she milks cows all day. Even boss 
Isaiah (Elliott Gould, “Mash”) is 
given less than stellar dialogue 

to work with, his lines often 
bordering on the obscene and 
soapy. Like many of the characters 
on “Doubt,” an interesting plotline 
is disregarded for cheesy one-
liners and a lineup of stars who feel 
as if they cannot pull themselves 
out of their comfort zones.

Despite a cast with overly 

dramatized background stories, 
Laverne Cox (“Orange is the New 
Black”) is open regarding her 
sexuality, but in a subtle manner 
which feels more natural and fits 
comfortably into the dynamic 
of the series. As someone who 
has faced injustice firsthand, her 
choices as a lawyer are much 
more structured and passionate. 
In the few times that Cox takes 
over the scene, she commands 
the screen with the conviction 
with which the remainder of the 
cast struggles. That being said, 
Cox is also given limited screen 
time, and though she shines in the 
courtroom, the transition between 
lawyer and bar patron is a sudden 
shift that doesn’t sit well with Cox 
and dulls her overall performance 
in the series.

However interesting the plot of 

“Doubt” sounds on paper, there 
is a haunting presence of “Law & 
Order” and performances of series 
past that holds “Doubt” back from 
reaching its intended potential. 
Though the narrative has aspects 
which could be compelling, the 
line delivery is less than stellar 
and an issue that does not sit 
comfortably with the series. I’ve 
yet to watch the remainder of the 
season, but if “Doubt” can clear 
up some of the standout issues 
experienced in the pilot episode, it 
may live up to the status of “Law & 
Order.” Then again, with so many 
similar series currently airing 
under the same premise, “Doubt” 
is an easily forgettable addition to 
this season’s lineup.

FROM THE VAULT
‘Allegiance’ sheds light

In 
remembrance 
of 
FDR’s 

Executive Order 9066 authorizing 
Japanese American internment on 
February 19, 1942, Rave Cinemas 
screened the movie version of the 
Broadway musical “Allegiance,” 
which tackles like in the camps.

The musical was created by 

“Star Trek” actor George Takei, 
inspired by his own experience 
growing up in an internment camp. 
It follows the Kimuras, a three-
generation family of Japanese 
immigrants, as their wishes for the 
future are stamped out once they 
are uprooted from their homes and 
transported to Heart Mountain 
camp in Wyoming. George Takei 
plays an elderly Sammy Kimura, 
encouraged by the ghost of his 
sister, Keiko to go “back to a time 
that no one speak of” and reflect 
on the painful and lasting family 
divide that internment caused.

When the Loyalty Questionnaire 

is 
distributed, 
with 
infamous 

questions 27 and 28 asking Japanese 
to sign their willingness to fight in 
the US military and forswear all 
allegiance to the emperor of Japan, 
each character takes a different 
strategy for resistance.

Sammy Kimura hopes to fight 

in the American military to prove 
that the Japanese are loyal citizens. 
On the other hand, Frankie Suzuki 
refuses to join the war effort, on 
the grounds that he is unwilling 

to fight for a country that treats 
his family like the enemy. This 
causes tensions within the family, 
and Keiko, who loves them both, 
attempts to bridge the gap.

A repeated refrain is the word 

gaman, which means to carry 
on. The families band together 
to start a baseball league and 
organize dances to make life in 
camp bearable. They fold the 
Loyalty questionnaire into an 
origami flower. Oji-chan nurtures 
a vegetable garden in the rocky 
mountain terrain, creating beauty 
and strength in a hopeless place.

Hannah, 
a 
white 
military 

nurse, who trusted that America’s 
government would act to keep the 
best interests of citizens in mind, 
feels torn once she falls in love 
with Sammy and realizes that the 
Japanese Americans are not enemy 
people. She sings: “I follow the 
rules, but should I?” The question 
echoes multiple times through the 
air, forcing the audience to question 
whether the legal system can be 
trusted to protect the rights of all 
citizens.

Because “Allegiance” tells an 

often overlooked part of American 
history, some Japanese Americans 
are concerned that that audiences 
will 
assume 
the 
musical’s 

interpretation of historical events 
is the ultimate truth, without 
knowing enough about the nuances 
of the time.

Some 
Japanese 
American 

organizations expressed concern 
over the portrayal of the JACL 

leadership and the 442nd combat 
team as a “suicide mission” without 
acknowledging 
the 
soldiers’ 

honorable 
contributions 
and 

progress it made. Others are also 
concerned that “Allegiance” passes 
unfair judgment on those who did 
not resist internment, because 
with the safety of loved ones at 
risk, balancing protection and 
justice was an incredibly difficult 
predicament.

On the other hand, actor Greg 

Watanabe, whose own family 
was interned at Heart Mountain, 
defended his portrayal of Mike 
Masaoka, saying: “It’s possible to 
be historically factual, and still 
express an opinion.”

Even with mixed reactions, 

“Allegiance” is groundbreaking 
for Japanese and Asian Americans 
because it paves the way for more 
dialogue to enter mainstream 
media. Not only is it the first major 
piece of media centered around 
internment, “Allegiance” is the 
first Broadway musical created 
by Asian Americans, directed 
by Asian Americans, with a 
predominantly Asian American 
cast.

The ending sequence reveals 

that 
almost 
120,000 
people 

watched “Allegiance” during its 
run on Broadway — the same 
number of Japanese that were 
interned. 
“Allegiance” 
opens 

up the conversation about a 
rarely discussed civil injustice, 
educating audiences to ensure 
that history doesn’t repeat itself.

Lewis shines in Wolverine debut

Miles Lewis may be new to 

the Michigan baseball team, 
but he isn’t new to college 
baseball. 
After 
transferring 

from 
the 
University 
of 

North Dakota, the redshirt 
sophomore left fielder wasted 
no time in making his mark for 
the Wolverines. 

As a Fighting Hawk, Lewis 

finished the 2016 season as the 
Western Athletic Conference 
Freshman of the Year and a 
freshman All-American. At the 
end of the season he had a .360 
batting average and 63 hits.

The Wolverines’ new left 

fielder faced the transition 
to Michigan due to North 
Dakota’s decision to cut its 
baseball 
program, 
leaving 

some uncertainty for players 
like Lewis. He didn’t allow this 
to affect his game, though. 
If anything, he’s only gotten 
better.

In all likelihood, it was 

disappointing for Lewis when 
the Fighting Hawks’ program 
got cut, but fortunately for 
Michigan, it received what 
could be its most prolific threat 
on offense this season.

“We were fortunate enough 

to get him, he was a heck of a 
player last year,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “He brings 
that impact ability to come in 
and solidify an outfield role 
and hit towards the top of the 
order and I think you’ll see 
good things out of him.”

Lewis 
boasts 
a 
lot 
of 

accomplishments already in 
his career, and if this weekend 
is any indication, he will earn a 
lot more as a Wolverine.

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 

traveled to Port St. Lucie, 
Fla. to battle Seton Hall, and 
though the Wolverines split 
the four-game series with the 
Pirates, Lewis provided a nice 
silver lining.

After 
a 
shaky 
start 
in 

Michigan’s 
season 
opener 

Friday, in which Lewis failed to 
get a single hit in five at-bats, he 
finished the weekend strong.

In the first game of Saturday’s 

doubleheader, 
both teams were 
locked at seven 
runs 
apiece, 

forcing 
the 

game into extra 
innings. Lewis, 
though, 
would 

have none of it.

In the bottom 

of 
the 
10th 

inning, 
Lewis 

knocked 
the 

first pitch he saw into shallow 
right field for a walk-off single, 
proving he could handle the 
pressure.

In that first game, Lewis had 

the hot bat, leading the team 
with four hits and driving in 
his game-deciding run.

His experience showed as he 

spearheaded the Wolverines’ 
comeback late in the game. He 
began Michigan’s fifth inning 
rally with a single to right field 
and later would score on an 

RBI single from 
senior 
catcher 

Harrison 
Wenson.

Lewis 
used 

his momentum 
to 
carry 
him 

into the second 
game. 
He 

notched 
two 

hits 
in 
three 

at-bats, but more 
importantly for 

Michigan, he earned these hits 
with men on base – driving in 
three runs in the third game of 
the weekend.

Though Lewis’ best day was 

Saturday, he proved once again 
Sunday that he could come in 
clutch when the Wolverines 
needed it the most.

With Michigan down by a 

run in the bottom of the third, 
Lewis led the offense to a four-
run inning. After sophomore 
second baseman Ako Thomas 
singled and stole two bases, he 
stood at third base with Lewis 
up to bat.

Lewis singled to right center, 

nothing 
particularly 
fancy, 

but it did the job, bringing 
Thomas home. After that, the 
runs just kept coming, with the 
Wolverines scoring three more 
times.

“Main thing is falling back 

on the training this fall, a lot 
of mental toughness training,” 
Lewis said. “That’s what our 
coaches prepared us for.”

After a stellar first weekend, 

Lewis leads Michigan with 
a .389 batting average and 
seven hits. With only one 
weekend under his belt, it will 
be exciting to see how Lewis 
grows with his new program.

SOFTBALL
Michigan thriving 
behind home runs

With a runner on first in the top 

of fifth inning, senior outfielder 
Kelly Christner shifted the force 
from her back leg to the front side 
of her body, reached her arms out 
over the plate and blasted the ball 
over the center field wall. North 
Carolina 
State 
pitcher 
Harli 

Hubbard could barely turn around 
in time to see the pitch descend out 
of sight, but she didn’t need to look 
to know the ball was gone.

It was Christner’s third home 

run in Friday night’s 12-0 rout of 
the Wolfpack, becoming the first 
Wolverine since 2009 and the 
fourth all-time to homer three 
times in the same game. She was 
honored the Big Ten Player of the 
Week on Monday for the effort.

“(Christner) was on fire that 

game,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “She really resonated 
with some of the timing things we 
had done in practice throughout 
the week.”

The blast proved to be a 

microcosm of the ACC/Big Ten 
Challenge for Michigan. The 
weekend’s four games saw the 
team tally a total of 10 home runs 
from six different players.

Sophomore second baseman 

Faith Canfield was one of those 
Wolverines. After ending Saturday 
night’s rematch against NC State 
with a grand slam, she struck again 
with a home run Sunday morning 
to help Michigan avenge an earlier 
loss to Notre Dame. Canfield, who 
was moved back to the cleanup 
spot in the team’s last two games, 
collected three hits and seven runs 
batted in during the second half of 
the weekend.

“It gives me a lot of confidence,” 

Canfield said. “But then again, you 
can’t get too high on the highs or 
too low on the lows.”

The 
performance 

demonstrated 
a 
strong 
early 

improvement for the sophomore, 

who hit just three home runs in 
44 games last season.

“All my freshman year, (power 

hitting) was the coach’s main focus 
for me,” Canfield said. “Coming in, 
I never really saw myself as a power 
hitter. I think that just buying into 
the coach’s plan of getting bigger 
and attacking harder with my 
swing and just looking to drive the 
ball has really been a huge focus. 
It’s really nice seeing all my hard 
work pay off.”

The 
weekend’s 
offensive 

production also proved to be an 
improvement for the entire team 
from the week prior, when the 
Wolverines averaged just 5.6 runs 
per game and hit only one home 
run in five contests.

But 
hitting 
homers 
wasn’t 

necessarily the focus of last week’s 
practices.

“Timing has been our focus,” 

Hutchins said. “Last weekend we 
barely hit the ball out of the infield, 
so I was very pleased to see our 
timing improved tremendously. It 
is still a work in progress, but we 
are hitting (for) power a lot better.”

As with any team that finds a 

burst of success at the beginning 
of the season, finding production 
with regularity will be crucial 
for the Wolverines during two 
tournaments in California over 
spring break. Naturally, that’s a 
focus for Hutchins this week.

“Certainly, we’re going to come 

together and get more of our kids 
to be consistent,” Hutchins said. 
“That’s a goal: to have more of the 
kids consistent throughout the 
lineup.”

Getting that power in addition 

to consistent contact from players 
throughout the order will make 
the Michigan’s lineup even more 
potent moving forward.

So early into the season, if 

nothing else, the dominance of 
the long ball is a sign of offensive 
improvement that will turn heads 
faster than Hubbard needed to on 
Christner’s home run Friday.

MARK CALCAGNO

Daily Sports Writer

In its five-year history, the 

Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
has never seen a season start 
like this one. After their 13-5 
victory over Bellarmine (0-2), 
the Wolverines (4-0) remain 
undefeated for the first time in 
program history.

More than 10 minutes of 

the first quarter passed before 
either 
team 
could 
manage 

a goal. It took until the 4:17 
mark for Michigan sophomore 
attacker 
Brent 
Noseworthy 

to 
break 
the 

stalemate. 
His 
goal 

was 
quickly 

followed 
by 

three more for 
the Wolverines, 
courtesy 
of 

sophomore 
midfielders 
Nick DeCaprio 
and 
Decker 

Curran 
and 

freshman 
midfielder 
Avery 

Myers.

Michigan’s 
4-0 
scoring 

run was briefly halted in the 
second period by the Knights’ 
Tucker Cisseau, but Curran 
and Noseworthy tacked on 
two more goals to give the 
Wolverines a 6-2 halftime lead.

Michigan continued to pad 

its lead through the remainder 
of the competition. In the third 
period, Noseworthy continued 
the success he has seen all 
season, notching three more 
goals for the Wolverines, two 
of which were assisted by 
sophomore 
attacker 
Rocco 

Sutherland.

While the Wolverines’ senior 

class dominated on defense and 
helped set up the offense, it was 
the underclassmen who found 
the scoring opportunities.

“Offensively, there’s a group 

of sophomores right now — 
Rocco 
Sutherland, 
Decker 

Curran — who are all a big part 
of our offense,” said Michigan 
coach John Paul. “Brent’s the 
beneficiary of what all of the 
other guys are doing. … We 

have a couple veteran guys out 
there, but we’re relying heavily 
on some of the younger guys, 
and they’re getting the job 
done.”

It wasn’t just the sophomores 

who 
played 
well, 
though. 

Senior attacker Ian King tied 
the school record of 113 career 
points, previously set by former 
Wolverine Kyle Jackson, and 
added two assists.

Defensively, 
Michigan 

played its best game of the 
season, allowing just five goals 
on 31 shots and winning 13 of 21 
faceoffs. Redshirt sophomore 

goalie 
Tommy 

Heidt made 11 
saves 
on 
the 

night.

“I 
thought 

it 
was 
more 

of 
a 
team 

performance 
today,” 
Curran 

said. 
“The 

offense 
has 

really 
been 

clicking, putting 

up some pretty big numbers 
on the (offensive) side. For any 
team, when the defense steps 
up, it allows the offense to just 
get going, and I think that’s 
what we did today.”

As 
impressive 
as 
their 

record may be, the Wolverines 
have yet to face some of their 
toughest 
competition. 
That 

will change soon as they look 
ahead to a meeting with No. 4 
Notre Dame next week.

“We’re not prepared yet, 

we’ve got a lot of work to do,” 
Paul said. “Something we’re 
going to be working on is just 
getting back to some really 
competitive 
practices 
we 

haven’t been able to do for a 
week.”

Still, with the way Michigan 

has 
played 
through 
the 

first part of its season, the 
Wolverines believe they can 
compete with the Fighting 
Irish.

“I think this team is a really 

talented group,” said junior 
attacker Patrick Tracy. “We 
know what to expect and we’re 
really excited for Notre Dame.”

of work to do”

Michigan falls in close matchup with N.C. State

The No. 16 Michigan and 

No. 7 N.C. State wrestling 
teams both sport top-ranked 
wrestlers in multiple weight 
classes, but the lineups from 
both teams in their dual meet 
meant that bonus points and 
a few close matches would 
ultimately decide the outcome.

The 

Wolverines got 
off to a strong 
start in their 
last dual meet 
of the season. 
They 
started 

in the heart of 
their 
lineup, 

with 
three 

straight 
wins 

starting 
at 

the 157-pound 
weight 
class. 
Ninth-ranked 

senior Brian Murphy delivered 
a 7-4 decision to put Michigan 
up 3-0. No. 2 redshirt freshman 
165-pounder 
Logan 
Massa 

nearly got a technical fall in 
the final seconds of his match, 
but could not secure his final 
takedown, putting Michigan 
up 
7-0. 
No. 
8 
freshman 

174-pounder 
Myles 
Amine 

had a dominant finish to his 
match, riding out his opponent 
the entire third period to a 5-2 
decision.

After the first three matches, 

the Wolverines had a 10-0 
lead, but then the Wolfpack 
stormed 
back. 
N.C. 
State’s 

No. 11 184-pounder Michael 
Macchiavello started to swing 
the momentum with an 18-7 
major decision.

One of the closer matchups 

of the dual came at the 197-
pound weight class, between 
redshirt 
freshman 
Jackson 

Striggow and N.C. State’s No. 
25 Malik McDonald. Striggow 
captured an early lead, but 
McDonald 
outlasted 
him 

for a 9-5 win, narrowing the 
wolfpack’s deficit to three.

In the heavyweight class, 

junior 
Payne 
Hayden 
was 

quickly pinned by N.C. State’s 
Mike Kosoy. Hayden was slow 
to get up, and clearly shaken, 

but it was unclear how he was 
injured. 
Kosoy’s 
dominant 

show 
against 
Hayden 
put 

Michigan down 10-13.

The closest match occurred 

in 
the 
125-pound 
match 

between 18th-ranked Michigan 
senior 
Conor 
Youtsey 
and 

N.C. State’s 12th-ranked Sean 
Fausz. Youtsey had a 3-0 lead 
heading into the third period, 
but Fausz scored a last-second 

takedown 
to 

force 
overtime. 

Youtsey 
shot 

a single leg at 
the 
start 
of 

overtime, 
but 

Fausz scored on 
a counterattack, 
to 
give 
the 

Wolfpack a 16-10 
lead.

With 
the 

momentum 

firmly in favor of NC State after 
earning 16 unanswered points, 
Michigan’s No. 7 freshman 
Stevan Micic had to deliver to 

keep the match close (against 
No. 18 Jamal Morris). He did 
just that, with a dominant win, 
securing the technical fall with 
a feet-to-back trip in the final 
moments of the match.

“It was pretty loud in there, 

the place was pretty packed 
and everyone was screaming,” 
Micic said. “But I was pretty 
focused on what I had to do.” 

Micic kept Michigan in the 

match, as the 
Wolverines 
trailed by only 
one 
leading 

into 
redshirt 

freshman 
Sal 
Profaci’s 

match.

Profaci had 

a tough task 
ahead of him, 
wrestling 
second-ranked 
Kevin Jack from N.C. State, and 
he fell 19-5. The final match 
was very close for redshirt 
sophomore Zac Hall, and was 

ultimately decided on riding 
time in favor of N.C. State. This 
put the final score at 23-15.

“They were a good team. 

They had proven it over the 
season,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “If maybe a 
few things hadn’t happened, 
a few things gone our way, we 
could’ve come away with it. 
But in the end we competed 
hard, and that’s what matters 

as we shift into 
tournament 
mode.” 

Michigan 

will be headed 
to the Big Ten 
Championships 
in three weeks, 
and 
soon 
after 

that to the NCAA 
championships. 
But 
if 
the 

Wolverines 

want to be successful heading 
forward, they will need to 
make a few more things go 
their way.

For Talcott, it’s about relationships with teammates

At 4:18 Monday afternoon, just 

a few players remained at Yost Ice 
Arena. Many of the members of 
the Michigan hockey team had 
departed. Their participation in 
practice had ended. The ones who 
remained did so because of their 
in-game absence in Madison this 
past weekend. 

While some of these players 

could be recognized by certain 
fans of the Wolverines, such as 
senior forward Alex Kile — who 
was injured last weekend — or 
junior forward Niko Porikos, 
one player would likely leave 
spectators wondering.

Alex Talcott spent that Monday 

practice as one of the last athletes 
on the ice.

Unlike Kile, Porikos and his 

other peers, the junior forward 
has yet to appear in a game during 
this season. Michigan coach Red 
Berenson has penciled Talcott in 

the lineup just eight times in his 
three years and just twice as a 
sophomore.

But despite Talcott’s lack of 

in-game 
experience, 
he 
still 

manages to impress Berenson 
with his work ethic.

“He’s a depth player,” Berenson 

said. “He knows that if we get a 
couple guys hurt, he’s gotta be 
ready. He hasn’t had a chance to 
show what he can do this year 
except in practice.”

While the active players dress 

and 
participate 
in 
pregame 

skates, Talcott and the other 
inactive players have different 
roles. They still eat the pregame 
meal with the team and practice 
in the early afternoon, but once 
the game begins they head to the 
weight room and prepare for the 
weekend’s second game.

It 
might 
be 
difficult 
to 

seemingly prepare for nothing, 
but 
Talcott 
has 
found 
his 

niche. 
He 
spends 
his 
time 

during practices and off the ice 

developing relationships with his 
teammates. It’s an area that he has 
dedicated himself to improving 
over his three-year career.

“To be a good teammate is a 

really important part of what 
I do,” Talcott said. “(To be) 
someone 
that 

one of the other 
guys can come to 
and talk to about 
things, to show 
them 
support. 

That way they’re 
confident 
when 

they’re playing.

“I try not to 

have any negative 
relationships. 
I 

don’t want to be 
in a situation where I’m dragging 
anybody down or dragging the 
team down as a whole. I try to 
be positive and upbeat, and if I’m 
not playing then I reinforce that 
behind the guys that are playing.”

For Berenson, it is likely 

rewarding 
to 
see 
Talcott 

succeeding 
in 
this 
role. 

He 
explained 
that 
Talcott 

encountered 
some 
difficulties 

during his first years in Ann 
Arbor and that “some guys 
would’ve maybe just quit.”

Berenson 
praised 
Talcott’s 

determination to 
thrive, something 
he sees daily at 
practice.

“Alex, 
he’s 

had a tough time 
here,” 
Berenson 

said. “... The good 
thing 
is 
we’ve 

stuck with him 
and the other part 
of the good thing 
is that he has stuck 

with it. He’s in a much tougher 
position than being (freshman 
forward) 
Will 
Lockwood 
or 

(senior defenseman) Nolan de 
Jong who are playing every night.

“He’s gotta say to himself ‘I’ve 

got to play better than these guys 
to be in the lineup. I’ve got to do 

that every day in practice.’ So 
there’s a challenge (for him.)”

One of the challenges for 

Berenson is how best to motivate 
Talcott when he will rarely see the 
ice during games. It’s a dilemma 
he faces not only with Talcott but 
other players such as sophomore 
goaltender Chad Catt, who rarely 
crack the rotation. He urges them 
to focus on their academics and 
again emphasizes their time spent 
in practice. While other players 
have opportunities to impress 
the coaching staff in games, for 
Talcott, it is imperative that he 
strives for excellence every other 
day of the week.

But even then, it’s difficult to 

find opportunities. Because of 
his status on the depth chart, 
Berenson will place Talcott on 
defense if the Wolverines lack 
a blueliner at practice, another 
obstacle in his desires to make an 
impression on the coaches.

That’s why Talcott remained at 

practice that Monday afternoon 

when most others moved on to 
homework or other activities. It 
was an opportunity for him to 
play some offense, showcase his 
shooting, passing and skating 
skills.

For the near future though, 

Talcott 
will 
continue 
giving 

assistance and motivating to his 
teammates. It might not be on the 
ice, or even during game time, but 
Talcott has carved out a role for 
himself.

“The relationships that I build 

with my teammates are built 
around respect and showing 
them that I really care about them 
and care about their success as if 
it was my success,” Talcott said. 
“And then in return it kind of is 
contagious. (It leads to) a better 
relationship with everyone on the 
team and then it manifests itself 
from there.

“I feel like that’s something I 

can bring to the team to influence 
it. Even if it’s in a small way, I’m 
still happy with that.” 

Michigan set to rebound against Rutgers

If not for a collapse in overtime 

— which featured two turnovers, 
an 0-for-2 trip to the free throw 
line and just six total points — the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
could have left 
Williams Arena 
on 
Sunday 

riding a four-
game winning 
streak. 

Instead, the 

Wolverines 
return to square 
one, with their 
first 
chance 

to 
bounce 

back from last 
weekend’s loss 
on Wednesday 
night, 
when 

Michigan 
will travel to 
Piscataway 
for a matchup 
against Rutgers in what will be 
the first of a three-game, 10-day 
stretch.

The Wolverines couldn’t ask 

for a much better team to face as 
they aim to get back in the win 
column. The Scarlet Knights (2-13 
Big Ten, 13-15 overall) sit at dead 
last in the Big Ten, and it’s easy to 
see why.

Rutgers ranks last in the 

conference in four categories 
— scoring 66.1 points per game, 
shooting just 41.2 and 29.4 
percent from the field and beyond 
the arc, respectively, and posting 
a lowly free throw percentage of 
61.2. Still, Michigan coach John 
Beilein refuses to allow his team 
to take the Scarlet Knights at face 
value.

“This is going to be a difficult 

one going to Rutgers,” Beilein 
said. “I know you look at the 
record, but look at the scores 
instead of the record and you’ll 
see, watching this team, they are 
going to be the best rebounding 
team that we’ve played all year.

“We are obviously not a great 

rebounding team, and that’s a 

tough matchup for us. … It is going 
to be a great win if we can get it. 
I know that sounds like ‘coach 
speak’, (but) I’m telling you it’s 
going to be a great win if we can 
get it. We’re going to have to 
play better than we did against 
Minnesota.”

Rebounding 
is 
certainly 

Rutgers’ one saving grace, as it 
leads the Big Ten with 41.1 per 
game — 15 of which come on the 
offensive glass. And if there were 
ever an advantage that Michigan 
wouldn’t want its opponents to 
have, it would be on the boards.

Unlike Rutgers, the Wolverines 

(7-7, 
17-10) 
sit 
last 
in 
the 

conference with 29.3 rebounds 
per game. Though sophomore 
forward Moritz Wagner has 
markedly improved — averaging 
5.4 rebounds through the last five 
contests — his emergence still 
isn’t enough to offset one of the 
biggest problems that Michigan 
has faced all year.

While 
rebounding 
should 

realistically be the only issue 

the Wolverines face Wednesday 
night, they are stepping onto 
the court against a team that is 
playing with house money. A 
loss to the Scarlet Knights could 
deal a serious blow to Michigan’s 
tournament 
resume, 
as 
the 

Wolverines have an invitation to 
the Big Dance to lose. Rutgers, 
on the other hand, has nothing to 
lose at all.

“We’ve been in that situation,” 

Beilein said. “We were in that 
two years ago, we were in that 
certainly my first year … of just 
trying to get a ‘W’ somewhere. 
They’ve been on the road I think 
the last two games, at their 
place right now, in a storied 
environment there at Rutgers 
— they’ve had some great teams 
back in the day.

“And they’re trying to grow 

that. I think with a new coach, 
it’s all fresh, a lot of enthusiasm. 
Every day there’s a small victory 
in that program right now, and 
a huge victory would be beating 
Michigan tomorrow.”

Regardless, there is no denying 

that, on paper, Michigan should 
win the matchup handily.

Though it stumbled against 

Minnesota, Michigan is still 
averaging 74.6 points over the last 
five games while allowing just 
66.2.

What’s more, all five of the 

Wolverines’ starters scored in 
double digits against the Golden 
Gophers — an encouraging sign 
of consistent production that they 
have been searching for all season.

Michigan 
holds 
an 

unimpressive 1-7 road record, 
but given that Rutgers’ season 
has been a consistent progression 
from bad to worse, the Wolverines 
should be able to bump that total 
up to two.

“We’ve just got to realize how 

close we are to reaching our 
goals,” said senior forward Mark 
Donnal. “Take it one game at a 
time and just really be locked in 
going into Rutgers, and make sure 
that we play up to our potential 
and not let anything beat us.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ relying on seniors

Two regular season games 

remain for the Michigan women’s 
basketball team. Winning only 
one would lock the Wolverines 
(10-4 Big Ten, 21-7 overall) into 
a top-four seed for the Big Ten 
Tournament.

If it can manage that, it will be 

No. 25 Michigan’s highest finish 
under fifth-year coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. This Monday marks the 
team’s third week spent in the top 
25 — already the longest stretch in 
which the Wolverines have been 
ranked in Barnes Arico’s tenure.

“This is a spot we’ve never been 

in,” Barnes Arico said. “I think our 
kids are getting incredibly tight, 
and I think the teams that are 
playing against us are coming out 
like, ‘Hey, we’re beating a ranked 
opponent, now that’s on our 
resume in the NCAA Tournament.’ 
That’s something our team has 
never faced before.” 

In the past few seasons, the 

Wolverines 
have 
consistently 

been the underdogs. They have 
never won more than 22 games in 
a season, and have never made it 
past the semifinal round of a Big 
Ten Tournament — ever.

With two regular season games 

left against unranked opponents 
Nebraska 
and 
Penn 
State, 

Michigan has an opportunity 
to make history by reaching the 
23-win mark. And it has prepared 
for this moment all year.

“I think we have the ability 

to come out and play against top 
teams,” said sophomore center 
Hallie Thome on Inside Michigan 
Basketball on Monday night. “In 
the beginning of the season we 
were in the Virgin Islands playing 
against all the top teams, and we 
were able to hold our own. I think 
having that confidence under our 
belt really helped us coming into 
the Big Ten season.”

Yet, Michigan has lost its last 

two matchups, including its first 
home loss of the season against 
Michigan 
State 
on 
Saturday 

afternoon. 
A 
record-breaking 

season is far from guaranteed, but 
the Wolverines have access to an 
unprecedented opportunity.

Michigan’s ranking, along with 

a streak of three 100-point games 
earlier this season, has already 
solidified the 2016-17 season as one 
of firsts for the program. But while 
the younger Wolverines relish this 
run, for the two co-captains, it is 
a bit bittersweet. Thursday night, 
senior guards Danielle Williams 
and Siera Thompson will play their 
final regular season home game at 
Crisler Center.

Thompson has started in every 

game this season and leads the 
team in assists with 140 — the only 
current Michigan player to break 
into triple digits in that category. 
Thompson also ranks fourth in 
points and third in rebounding.

Williams has started 15 of 28 

games, and while she has just 53 
points, she is an effective defensive 
presence every time she steps on 
the court. 

Both seniors are known as stable 

presences for the Wolverines, 
which will be an important factor 
in postseason play. With two of 
their top three leading scorers— 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick — having shooting 
troubles recently, the seniors’ 
steadying focus will be necessary 
to get the team back on track.

Michigan’s postseason might 

even hinge on Williams and 
Thompson’s ability to lead the 
team during the next two games 
because winning will give the 
Wolverines a bye for the first round 
of the Big Ten Tournament.

“We are at our best when we 

have that time to prepare for our 
opponent,” Barnes Arico said on 
WTKA Radio. “So that would be a 
position we would be really excited 
about and I think it could definitely 
be a difference maker moving into 
the Big Ten Tournament.”

With a core group of five starters 

that average over 25 minutes a 
game, the rest afforded from a bye 
could be crucial.

M

y friend Eli 
Chanoff once 
remarked 
that everyone 

in the world would benefit 
from drinking a tall glass of 
water right now. I think this 
is probably true. It is certainly 
true for me. Out of the set of 
emotional and physical states 
a person can be in — of which 
there are many, maybe infinite 
— dehydrated is the one I most 
commonly exist in.

I notice, most acutely, the 

symptoms of my dehydration 
when I’m in class. The corners 
of my eyes get a little blurry, 
as if someone put tiny drops 
of water in them. Sometimes I 
feel like I’m drifting away from 
my body. I’ll lean back into my 
chair and most of me will be 
caught by the back of the chair 
but part of me will keep tilting 
back, back and out of my body. 
I’m equal parts familiar with 
the sensation and insanely 
freaked out by it. I panic until 
something snaps me back into 
my own body and I resolve to 
hydrate more the next day.

The problem is, I forget to 

remember.

I wake up the next morning 

and forget to drink water, I 
forget that yesterday I spent 
class swirling in my body 
instead of paying attention. I 
choose instead to recycle my 
saliva for 30 minutes until I 
down a $3 coffee. I tell myself 

coffee is made from water so it’s 
hydrating me in some way.

I generally believe that the 

reason anybody is anything is 
extremely complicated.

I like to believe that I am 

dehydrated because of a set 
of small, seemingly unrelated 
factors that subtly pushed 
me toward dehydration and 
continue to push me away 
from hydration. What if I never 
got into the habit of carrying 
around a reusable water bottle 
because my mother liked the 
ease and aesthetic of red Solo 
cups? What if that has made 
me subconsciously undervalue 
backpacks with exterior water 
bottle pockets? What if, before 
all of that, Ralph Nader diluted 
some percentage of Gore’s 
votes in Florida and maybe, 
just maybe, if Gore had won he 
would have enacted some set of 
policies that inspired a young 
Harry Krinsky to stop drinking 
out of red Solo cups and start 
drinking out of Nalgenes, BPA 
or no BPA? Of course, owning 
a reusable water bottle does not 
guarantee perpetual hydration, 
but the point is most mornings 
I wake up with the implicit goal 
of hydrating myself, and almost 
every night, I go to bed with a 
dry mouth and yellow pee.

The alternative, of course, is 

that I am dehydrated because 
I choose not to drink enough 
water — I am to blame. I’m not 
sure where I stand on why I am 

dehydrated. Something worth 
exploring, though, is where 
agency begins and ends in all of 
this, and getting to the bottom 
of how and where I actually 
control any individual habit in 
my life is a thought experiment 
worth doing.

As a middle schooler dealing 

with anxiety, I developed this 
ritual where I would imagine 
all of the bad thoughts swirling 
in my head as urine in my 
bladder, and when I peed, I’d 
imagine pumping the half-
conceptualized anxieties out 
of my brain, into my bladder 
and out of my body. Water 
is 
tangentially 
related 
to 

dehydration, so bear with me.

This was a strange habit, 

and Freud would have had 
something to say about it, 
and my therapist certainly 
had something to say about it. 
He told me it wasn’t a useful 
technique because repelling 
anxieties only make them more 
real. The analogy of choice is 
playing baseball with a ball that 
is attached to a long elastic rope 
that is also attached to your bat. 
If you hit a home run, the ball 
will fly far, far away over the 
fence and into the toilet bowl. 
It will, however — as most 
things attached to long elastic 
strings — eventually come 
back. It won’t just come back, 
it will shoot back, powered by 
whatever really basic physics 
concept explains what I’m 

talking about. The ball won’t 
just come back, it will be 
hurled back at you, smacking 
you in the back or the gut or 
the head. The solution: Bunt. 
When translated to an 11-year-
old with anxiety, this means 
keep your anxiety close to you 
because, after all, a baseball 
is a relatively small burden to 
carry to first base. (The analogy 
breaks down when we consider 
what running to first base with 
the ball in hand would look 
like.)

All 
that 
sounds 
simple 

enough, but bunting, just like 
hydrating, is equal parts easy 

to understand and difficult to 
follow through on.

I try my best to bunt when 

I can, but often I forget to 
bunt or forget to remember 
to bunt or forget to drink 
water or forget to care about 
school or forget to watch 
“An Inconvenient Truth.” 
I think about pee so much 
because I’m dehydrated and 
maybe I don’t think about 
education enough because 
I am educated. I think 
about habits because I had 
a therapist when I was 11 
and I bunt when I can, but I 
sometimes forget to.

BY SYLVANNA GROSS, DAILY SPORTS EDITOR

ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN TOLAR

“

So, what are your plans for next year?”

Eight words that all seniors respond to 

with immediate sweaty palms and slight 
nausea. It’s an involuntary response that 
most of us experience because being asked 

to confront the biggest source of stress we have at this 
moment is awful.

Every. Single. Senior. Has heard this question — at 

minimum — 10,000,000,000,000 times this year alone. 
And, in case you slept through the last moments of 2016 
and Mariah Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance, it’s 
just two months into the new year.

The question itself is relatively harmless at face 

value. It’s a natural follow-up to the normal “How are 
you?” “I’m good, how are you?” type of conversation 
you have twice every hour on average. More often 
than not, though, the question is asked by someone 
carelessly inquiring about your future on the off-
chance that they’ll be interested. Or, their parents just 
taught them good manners and reminded them not to 
talk just about themselves during small talk.

Coming from peers, the question is inquisitive. 

Coming from relatives, the question can be intrusive 
and coming from strangers the question can be 
invasive. But for whatever reason the question is asked, 
there’s still the obvious fact that you must now answer 
it.

And that’s why a lot of 

us want to spontaneously 
combust, because we just 
don’t know. And in a society 
where saving face is key 
and having your stuff 
together is attractive, 
admitting 
that 
we 

are clueless AF is 
unbearable.

No matter how 

you answer the 
question, you’re 
trapped. 
If 

you’re one of the chosen few and have already locked 
down a job or a graduate position or whatever, you feel 
guilty by bragging or feel disheartened when they don’t 
care or feel protective if nosy relatives give you their 
take on what you’re choosing to do.

Because clearly Aunt Helen knows more about 

working in a lab than you, even though you’re the one 
graduating with a degree in biomedical engineering.

If you respond with a joke, others might feel that you 

aren’t taking things seriously and you might become 
a bum. If you respond with a simple “I don’t know,” 
the pesky counterpart will probably follow up with a 
“Well, do you have any ideas?” type of question.

So how, as seniors, do we grapple with publicizing 

one of the scariest transitions in our lives while also not 
knowing what to publicize?

I’ve found that politely disassociating with the 

conversation works. That, and learning to just have 
quick hits such as “I’ve applied to some jobs” or “Some 
graduate schools are looking at my application now.” 
Just enough information to quell the nosiest inquirer, 
but not enough to display how much you have no clue 
what’s going on.

In truth, there’s a part of me that loves the question. 

I mean, it’s inviting me to talk about myself, which is 

amazing. When I first started getting the question in 
September, I would jump at the chance to talk freely 
about all the possibilities I had in front of me. Quickly, 
when I saw my friends solidifying their post-graduation 
plans, my frankness turned to embarrassment because 
there was nothing definitive. And then it turned to 
humor. Over holiday break, my friend asked me what I 
will be doing my next year and I just laughed.

It’s not that I find not knowing what I’m going to 

be doing funny, it’s just that I find my reaction to 
the question now funny. Going into senior year, and 
hearing from former then-senior friends, I knew 
that people didn’t like being asked that question, 
which I had always found unfathomable. How do 
you not like talking about yourself? But I think I 
get the dislike now. The question just invites me 
to continuously face an unknown future, which 
scares me quite shitless.

So, I’m not suggesting that people don’t ask, 

because I understand the knee-jerk curiosity for 
someone else’s life. But, maybe, wait for them to 
post a Facebook status about their job offer or 
graduate school offer or whatever else they might 
be doing before subjecting them to the challenge of 
explaining their (probably) stressful decisions. 

How to: Respond to The Question

1. So, you’ve been asked about 

your plans.
2. First rule: No matter how much you want to claw 

their eyes out, consider that the last resort.

3. Remember you probably really like whoever 

asked.
4. Seriously, remember that.

5. And if you don’t — well, your mom would 

want you to stay calm.

6. Now, open your mouth.
7. Say words.

8. You can lie; for all they know, it’s the truth.

10. OK, stop saying words. You’ve probably said 

enough to bore them to the next topic of conversation.

11. Take a deep breath.

12. Because at the end 

of the day, you’ll figure 
something out.

9. Say more words.

n an opening scene of “The Dan-

premiered last month, James Bur-

rill 
Angell, 
then-University 
of 

Michigan president, stands before 

the Board of Regents at a late 1870s meeting 

to fight for women’s right to admission to the

As a contribution to the ongoing bicenten-

University history when forward-thinking 

campus leaders faced resistance from the 

institutional norms of the day. Portrayed as a 

fatherly figure, Angell challenges his conser-

vative opponents in favor of a woman’s right to 

enroll at the University.

“What struck me most strongly, doing 

research, was the humanity in the history,” 

the play’s program quotes McGlashen as say-

ing. “Social movements of the time inspired 

some and threatened others. The students 

were barely adults, and the adults were just 

doing the best with the world they lived in, 

and that’s the most quintessentially human 

thing.”

However, there is more to Angell’s his-

tory than can be conveyed on a stage. Today, 

Angell is known as the namesake of Angell 

Hall and the oldest senior honor society at the 

University. The beloved Michigan Union was 

dedicated to him. Few, however, associate him 

with negotiating an exclusionary immigration 

policy viewed darkly in U.S. history.

Following his tenure as University presi-

dent, Angell played a key role in drafting the 

Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 while serving as 

U.S. minister to China. Renamed “The Angell 

Treaty,” it became the first comprehensive 

law limiting immigration to the United States. 

The treaty led to a decade-long moratorium on 

Chinese laborers and restricted those who had 

already migrated in response to racial preju-

dice and anger over wage competition on the 

West Coast. Chinese immi-

gration would be effectively 

banned until 1943.

Campuses 
across 
the 

nation have been roiled by 

the question of historical 

revisionism, or the desire 

to reconcile modern moral-

ity with the darker points 

of an academic institution’s 

history.

At Yale University, stu-

dents staged a sit-in at 

Calhoun College in protest 

of the school’s namesake, 

alum John C. Calhoun the 

seventh vice president of 

the U.S., who championed 

slavery as a “positive good.” 

Earlier this month, Yale 

administrators agreed to 

rename the college after 

Grace Hopper, a Yale alum, 

computer science pioneer 

and Navy admiral.

In late 2015, Princeton 

University students chal-

lenged the name of the uni-

versity’s Woodrow Wilson 

School of Public and Inter-

national 
Affairs. 
Though 

Wilson — who served as pres-

ident of both Princeton and 

later the United States — was a champion of 

national self-determination and democracy 

abroad, his administration pursued domestic 

segregationist policies far more aggressive 

than those of his predecessors. In spite of the 

president’s controversial policies, Princeton’s 

board of trustees declined to rename the 

school in April 2016.

Debates surrounding the renaming of Uni-

versity buildings raise an uneasy question: 

How can the dark episodes of American his-

tory be reconciled with the country’s current 

values?

Former LSA Dean Terrence McDonald, a 

professor of history and director of the Bent-

ley Historical Library, currently serves as 

chairman of the President’s Advisory Com-

mittee on University History, which was 

commissioned by University President Mark 

Schlissel in the spring of 2016 to draft guide-

lines for renaming University buildings.

The committee released a memo in Janu-

ary outlining eight principles for consider-

ation upon renaming a University building, 

including pedagogy, interpretation, histori-

cal and institutional context, contemporary 

effect and a proposed process for implementa-

tion. There are, however, no binding rules for 

future buildings, and any name change must 

receive approval from the board.

“Our document is not a policy on naming,” 

McDonald said. “If a historical question is 

raised about an existing name, that’s when 

we come into play. None of the principles will 

determine (what names are chosen), but taken 

together they will offer perspectives.”

McDonald said the timing of the memo is 

explained by the coming of age, not only of the 

University, but of academic institutions across 

the nation.

“It’s really incredible how much we’re start-

ing to learn about the University,” McDonald 

said. “These issues of … naming buildings have 

been in the air at other campuses at well. Their 

own anniversaries have created this pushback 

to history. Georgetown was financially saved 

by the sale of slaves. How do you deal with it?”

*****

Hindsight has not favored Clarence Cook 

Little, a biologist who was president of the 

University from 1925 to 1929. Born to an “old 

Boston family” that traces its lineage to Paul 

Revere, Little progressed to Harvard Univer-

sity, where he studied genetics and cancer.

After serving as an officer in World War 

I, Little jumped between various academic 

positions, serving as president of the Univer-

sity of Maine from 1922 to 1925 before he was 

appointed president of the University.

Serving as University president from 1925 

to 1929, Little’s name has been attached to 

the C.C. Little Science Building on Central 

Campus since 1968. In recent years, however, 

students have questioned whether his name 

contradicts the University’s values.

During his brief tenure, Little did rela-

tively little. He banned alcohol in fraternity 

houses, tried to limit the use of automobiles in 

some areas of campus and expanded research 

resources available to faculty. Little resigned 

after four years — hurt by a recent divorce and 

facing opposition from segments of the faculty 

— and dedicated the remainder of his career to 

research, becoming managing director of the 

American Cancer Society in 1929.

However, Little was also a firm believer 

in eugenics, a now-discredited pseudo-sci-

ence that sought to improve the human race 

through selective breeding, maintaining that 

certain genes were defective and should be 

kept from reproducing.

In Europe, Nazi leaders used eugenics 

to justify violent and discriminatory poli-

cies against Jews and other populations they 

deemed “inferior,” such as homosexuals, dis-

abled people and Romani. 

Little was a president of the American 

Eugenics Society, an organization that spear-

headed the promotion of eugenics education 

nationwide. He also supported eugenic ster-

ilization, maintaining that those who were 

deemed “unfit” for breeding should be steril-

ized. In accordance with the sterilization laws 

enacted by the state, the University’s hospital 

performed forced sterilizations until the mid-

20th century.

Little’s beliefs were not unique to the time, 

nor was he alone at the University. Eugenics 

was widely accepted across the medical pro-

fession and Victor Vaughan, the first dean of 

the University’s Medical School, held similar 

views. The Victor Vaughan building is also 

located on Central Campus, serving as a hos-

pital administration building located on Cath-

erine Street.

Because of his belief in eugenics, Little sup-

ported birth control — an unusual position at the 

time — as a means to prevent what he considered 

unworthy pregnancies.

Along with John Harvey Kellogg, popularly 

known as the cereal magnate and less popularly 

known for his questionable politics and support 

for eugenics, Little helped organize the third 

Race Betterment Conference in 1928, at which 

people shared what would now be considered 

discriminatory, exclusionary and racist ideas.

“It’s the easiest thing in the world to judge 

people by our contemporary standards,” McDon-

ald said. “What we know and stand for and what 

people in the time knew and stood for. And we 

need to understand that. And historians 

wrestle with that all the time, but that’s the 

complicated thing. How do we have sufficient 

knowledge, and empathy, and how can we 

stand back and judge what they did?”

A panel discussion, titled “The Power of 

Place-Naming: C.C. Little, Eugenics, and the 

University of Michigan,” will be held in April 

to debate the merits of the continued use of 

Little’s name on campus buildings. Ameri-

can Culture Prof. Alexandra Stern, author of 

“Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontiers of Bet-

ter Breeding in Modern America” is organiz-

ing the panel.

Stern said her bicentennial event will 

explore the implications of the University’s 

history as it pertains to Little. She said while 

there were many connections between the 

eugenics movement in the early 20th century 

and the University, the same could be said for 

prominent universities across the country.

“But what is interesting and what prompts 

us to use the bicentennial as a period of 

reflection,” Stern said. “He was only presi-

dent for four years — he appears to have left 

due to some pressure because of his contro-

versial ideas and some of his discriminatory 

belief.”

The panel discussion, which Stern hopes 

will consist of three to four faculty members, 

will create the forum for a conversation about 

the process of naming, and talk through it as 

part of a deliberative process.

“I’m not coming to the event with my deci-

sion already made about what should hap-

pen to the building,” Stern said. “Should the 

building be renamed? Who was C.C. Little? 

What does it mean that thousands of under-

graduates everyday are going into this build-

ing named after a person with those beliefs? 

Do we erase history if we take a name off the 

building, and if we do, do we sanitize the past 

to make it cleaner and neater for ourselves?”

Stern said that though it was planned 

before the memo’s release, her event coin-

cides in the spirit of those guidelines.

Overall, Stern said, she believes the nam-

ing process at the University should not be 

lightly undertaken. In the context of history, 

she said, figures praised in their time, like 

C.C. Little, may not remain so pleasant when 

viewed through the lens of their contempo-

raries.

“I think the real question is: Does the C.C. 

Little name and does his history, does it rise 

to the level of needed to be renamed by the 

University?” Stern said. “The fact is it is get-

ting close to that threshold, because it keeps 

coming up.”

 

***

Further complicating the question of the 

naming of University buildings is the influ-

ence of donors. Contrary to what most believe, 

Jim Harbaugh’s job title isn’t the head coach 

of the Michigan football team. Instead, he is 

officially the J. Ira and Nicki Harris family 

head football coach. Because of a $10 million 

donation to the Athletics Department, all 

those who hold the position will also bear the 

Harris family name.

Those who donate to the University decide 

what happens to their funds, which has occa-

sionally been a point of contention with the 

University community. When the renaming 

guidelines were released in January, mem-

bers of the campus community rehashed some 

recent naming grievances, including the con-

troversy surrounding the changing of Denni-

son Hall to Weiser Hall 

in 2014. The change 

was enacted when Ron 

Weiser — a sitting Uni-

versity regent — made a 

$50 million donation to 

the school.

McDonald 
high-

lighted pedagogy as the 

most essential of the 

guidelines for renam-

ing buildings. For him, 

every naming oppor-

tunity can be a teach-

ing opportunity, even 

in cases of financial 

endowments.

“Acknowledging 
a 

perfectly generous gift 

to the University, that’s 

an excellent thing to 

teach about,” McDon-

ald said. “When some-

one makes a donation, 

it’s not inappropriate 

to put their names on 

it. We’re teaching about 

generosity, and giving 

back and commitment 

to this University. It can 

be a good example of 

pedagogy.”

Weiser was not the only 

donor to face pushback for attempting to rename 

a building after himself. Last semester, Regent 

Mark Bernstein (D) donated $3 million to the 

reconstruction of the Trotter Multicultural Cen-

ter on the condition it be renamed the Bernstein 

Multicultural Center. Amid criticism by students 

and members of the campus community that 

changing the name of the center would erase 

William Monroe Trotter’s legacy, Bernstein 

withdrew the funds.

Trotter was a civil rights activist and co-

founder of the NAACP in 1909. The Trotter Cen-

ter is the only building on campus named after an 

African American.

These episodes raise the question of whether 

the name of a historical figure can be replaced 

by a large donor in the future.

“When the University makes a commitment 

to a name, it’s a very serious commitment,” 

McDonald said. “We have to understand this 

is the commitment the University’s made. 

There is a heavy burden of proof to change a 

name.”

Tappan Hall, named after Henry Philip 

Tappan, the first University president, hous-

es the Fine Arts Library. The building was 

named after him in the 1890s, 40 years after 

his 11-year term.

“It would be hard to find a critic for Presi-

dent Tappan ... (even though he) was vehe-

mently opposed to the admission of women,” 

McDonald said. “What do you do about this? 

He was a visionary leader, except for one 

thing. Nobody’s perfect, no context is com-

plete.”

As the University looks beyond the bicen-

tennial, these naming debates will continue. 

Though these are not questions with easy 

answers, context as well as understanding 

are crucial tools moving forward.

T

o this day, I remember the 

photos.

I was 12 years old when Robyn 

“Rihanna” Fenty, a 20-going-

on-21-year-old pop artist from Barbados, 

suddenly canceled her performance for the 

51st annual Grammy Awards. Despite the 

fact that I was hardly a Rihanna fan at the 

time, I found myself intrigued by the news. 

I remained concerned as the story unfolded 

rapidly, bursting forth like a phoenix from 

a fire. But my curiosity quickly changed to 

disgust when from these sensationalized 

flames emerged a disturbing account of 

intimate partner violence.

Suddenly, photos of Rihanna — her face 

bruised and contorted at the hands of then-

boyfriend Chris Brown — were blasted across 

newspapers, websites and television screens 

across the country in what I cannot help 

but see as a grotesque invasion of privacy. 

Through it all, I could not help but wonder: 

How did a “verbal dispute” escalate to the 

point that bodies were battered? How could 

Brown, a rising musician from a small town 

in Virginia with so much “potential” commit 

such a horrible act? What man is capable of 

procuring so much rage, fury and coldness 

that he can, with a flash of his fist, induce so 

much suffering in a woman he is supposed to 

“love?”

I did not feel any sense of resolution or 

justice — and I certainly do not feel these 

things when I think of the incident now — 

when Chris Brown was sentenced to five 

years of probation, one year of domestic 

violence counseling and 1,400 hours of 

“labor-oriented service.” My disappointment 

stemmed from the realization that no amount 

of “restorative” measures could compensate 

for the wounds Rihanna sustained. As both a 

public figure and survivor, her entire personal 

life and social network was dissected by the 

jaws of an entertainment-thirsty public, most 

of whom could only imagine the way the 

incident affected her.

But even then, she would be expected to 

maintain the trajectory of her career while 

Brown was allowed to retain his. I could not 

— still cannot — fathom how some can idolize 

a man capable of such 

violence and even refer 

to him as an “artist.” 

There is nothing artistic 

about domestic violence 

in the slightest, and 

nothing 
compensatory 

about 
a 
two-minute 

YouTube apology.

Eight 
years 
later, 

I 
continue 
to 
think 

about Rihanna’s story 

as a symbol of a more 

widespread 
issue. 

At its core, domestic 

violence 
is 
based 

on 
skewed 
power 

dynamics, intimidation 

and 
coercion, 
and 

affects 
individuals 
of 

all 
gender 
identities, 

socioeconomic 

backgrounds, 
sexual 

orientations, age ranges 

and ability statuses.

Domestic 
violence 

remains 
one 
of 
the 

most 
misunderstood 

forces in our society. 

Both in high school 

and at the University of 

Michigan, I have heard 

my peers argue against 

a survivor’s credibility 

based on “what she was 

wearing,” “how much 

she was drinking” and 

even her inability to “read cues.” These 

statements contribute to a culture of blame 

that both silences survivors and overlooks 

the accountability of perpetrators.

The National Domestic Violence Hotline 

estimates that one in four women and one 

in seven men over the age of 18 have faced 

severe physical violence from a partner at 

some point in their lives. However, domestic 

violence can also manifest itself in other ways 

— including economic abuse, threatening 

relationships between a survivors and their 

children, forcefully isolating a partner and 

using coercion to manipulate a partner’s 

emotions. Yet, I know from my own personal 

experiences that these forms of violence are 

rarely shown in media.

During my first semester at the University, 

I enrolled in a women’s health class 

that challenged me to look beyond this 

dramaticized lens. I was touched by the 

words of Heidi Sproull, a clinical social 

worker whose experiences involved working 

with survivors and perpetrators of sexual 

violence. Through a narrative that was both 

vulnerable and powerful, Sproull reminded 

us that the body is not an open book, but a 

sacred space that can be vandalized by forces 

of coercion and control.

To this day, I reflect on this course and 

the way that it further inspired me to learn 

more about domestic violence. Since then, 

I have pursued more coursework in gender 

and health and volunteered for our campus’s 

Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness 

Center. I have learned from fellow students 

and volunteers that domestic violence is 

hardly a “one-size-fits-all” crime; rather, 

one that is influenced by race, class, sexual 

orientation, tribal affiliation, citizenship 

and ability status. I have come to see that we 

cannot understand the gravity of domestic 

violence without considering the unique 

backgrounds and experiences of the survivor.

As students at the University, we must 

consider our campus’s culture surrounding 

domestic and sexual violence. While as many 

as 20 percent of female undergraduates have 

experienced some form of “unwanted kissing, 

groping, digital penetration, or oral, vaginal, 

or anal sex” according to the 2015 Campus 

Climate Survey, less than 4 percent of cases 

will be reported. We have to ask ourselves: 

What does it mean to truly be the Leaders 

and the Best? As our University approaches 

its 200th birthday, we still have a long way 

to go before our campus community is active 

in the fight against intimate partner violence 

and rape culture.

As someone who has neither experienced 

nor directly witnessed domestic violence, 

I write this piece from a place of immense 

privilege, and perhaps one of some distance. 

But nonetheless, I am driven to write about 

this issue because I dream of living in a 

violence-free world. I aspire to live and 

participate in a community where domestic 

violence is regarded not as a “woman’s issue,” 

but as a human rights concern. I recognize 

that eradicating this issue — given President 

Donald Trump’s attitude toward the Violence 

Against Women Act — mandates that we 

question deeply rooted social doctrines 

regarding consent, masculinity, gender and 

sexuality.

But perhaps most importantly, I ask that 

we — as a campus community, rather than 

individuals — challenge our discomfort 

rather than abandoning it. When we 

recognize that domestic violence is anything 

but a “private” matter to be isolated behind 

closed doors, we can take a step forward 

in promoting a space that is safe for all. 

I am steadfast in my belief that no college 

campus, city, state or nation can consider 

itself fully developed as long as domestic 

violence persists.

Personal Statement: 
 To the ER and Beyond

I 

never expected to spend the morning of Jan. 24 in 
the emergency room. I didn’t think I’d be hooked 
up to an IV when I should have been sitting in my 

“Origins of Nazism” lecture at 11:30.

Somehow, on that Tuesday I found myself in a bed in 

the emergency room at the University Hospital, wear-
ing a typical gown and enjoying some vanilla yogurt and 
apple juice. As soon as I regained consciousness, I could 
only think of one question: Who was she?

***
I don’t really know how I passed out that morning. 

I didn’t sleep the night before — only about five-and-
a-half hours because of my heavy homework load and 
conversations with my hallmates. I also neglected to eat 
breakfast. I walked through the snow to Chem 1800 and 
sat in the back for another Psych 112 lecture — a class 
that, even on a good day, I struggle to remain focused. At 
a certain point, I began to feel dehydrated and left to fill 
my water bottle.

The next thing I know, I’m lying on a hard tile floor 

with a girl crouched next to me reassuring me and 
attempting to ease the bleeding. I couldn’t really see 
what was happening and thought I had a concussion. 
I was frightened, tired and hungry. I didn’t know how 
hard I hit my head and if my fall caused damage. Would 
I need stitches? Did I have a concussion? Any permanent 

damage? (For those wondering: yes, no and no thank 
God).

Through all of my shock and nervousness, she spoke 

to me while her friend assured the paramedics were 
en route from the hospital. That ride didn’t go so well 
either. I begged for water while the paramedics in the 
back of the ambulance told me no each time, increasing 
my stress from zero to one hundred. I really just want-
ed a cup of apple juice or a bowl of cereal. Eventually, I 
arrived at the hospital. The nurses and doctor did some 
preliminary tests and then allowed me to take a two-
hour siesta. Finally, I received my cup of apple juice and 
called my parents to tell them what happened.

After my nap, I (obviously) checked my phone. Still, 

I kept wondering who it was that helped me, something 
I slowly began to realize would be nearly impossible to 
figure out. There are 28,000 undergrads at the Universi-
ty of Michigan. How could I possibly find the one person 
who happened to be in the Chem Building at 9:30 and 
helped the guy who passed out? 

You might be wondering why I was obsessed with find-

ing the girl who helped me. I began the search because, 
without this person, I don’t know what would’ve hap-
pened. She knew immediately to grab a paper towel to 
stop the blood oozing from my head. So, yeah, it was a big 
deal to find out who may have just saved my life.

A few days went 

by, and even though 
I expressed some 
curiosity 
toward 

finding who saved 
me, 
it 
eventually 

became more spec-
ulative. What if I 
found this person 
— not really think-
ing it was possible. 
I didn’t know what 
method to pursue 
and 
my 
“search” 

began to feel more 
and more like an 
unsolved mystery.

It 
took 
some 

prodding from my 
physician uncle to 
really seek out the 
girl. We spoke on 
the phone at length 
about 
the 
injury 

and he urged me 
to find who saved 

me. The next day, 

I called the Division of Public Safety and Security, but, 
because I called after hours, the records department 
employees had already left for the weekend. My search 
would have to wait until Monday.

***
After class on Monday, I called again and spoke to a 

woman from the records department. I told her about my 
“quest” to find who helped me and, to my surprise, she 
was interested in helping, which made me optimistic. At 
least I wasn’t too crazy, I thought.

I gave her my incident number and learned the details 

of the people present at the scene. Unfortunately, she 
only had Officer Kevin Rice’s name, not the name of the 
person who first spotted me (big shoutout to Officer 
Rice). It appeared I hit a dead end. But, I was undeterred.

And as I sat in the library a few hours later, I estab-

lished my next step: I would post in the University of 
Michigan class of 2019 Facebook group. I’ll look like an 
idiot, but I thought that maybe I’ll gain some closure. I 
wrote in the group (YOLO, right?):

Complete Longshot but I believe in miracles: Last 

Tuesday morning I passed out in the Chemistry build-
ing and two girls came over right away and helped me 
ease my injuries and called the ER. I’m really grateful 
and it’d be great to send you a thank you note/get you a 
Starbucks. From what I remember, one girl was named 
Allie (sp.?) and you were selling food for a student orga-
nization. If you know this person/are this person please 
let me know. Thank you.

Sure enough, about an hour later, I saw someone com-

mented on my post, tagging her friend. Her friend then 
messaged me and I learned that, yes, she had indeed 
been the girl who saw me fall in the Chem Building.

As you could probably expect, I was in shock. My per-

sistence paid off. A few weeks later, we met at Starbucks 
in the Union and rehashed. She told me it wasn’t the first 
time she’d helped someone who passed out, so she knew 
exactly what to do. I would no longer wonder, “What if,” 
about the incident. I learned all I needed to about my 
frightening morning.

***
Nearly a month later, it’s still puzzling to think I spent 

a day in the emergency room. It’s just as incredible that a 
far-fetched, seemingly improbable request in a Facebook 
post — in a group of more than 17,000 people — some-
how reached the right person. The experience taught me 
a great deal.

I’ve learned to be mindful of my surroundings, to 

always look to see if I can be of assistance. I’ve learned 
that sometimes, even the craziest ideas can work. Final-
ly, and perhaps most importantly, I’ve learned to eat 
breakfast and get a good night’s sleep.

I don’t want to end up in the ER again.
