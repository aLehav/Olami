A2 Art Fair 
showcases a 
different side 
of Ann Arbor

57th annual Ann Arbor Street 
Art Fair seeks younger crowd

Fair extends 

through weekend 

to stimulate 
downtown 
businesses

The 57th Ann Arbor Street 

Art Fair will — for the first 

time ever — last throughout 
the entire weekend, hopefully 
drawing new crowds of specta-
tors and artists.

This year’s Art Fair will 

run from Thursday to Sunday, 
instead of the traditional slot 
of Wednesday to Saturday, to 
hopefully stimulate more busi-
ness in the downtown and draw 
both a new and younger crowd 
of artists and visitors.

The Art Fair has has been an 

annual tradition in Ann Arbor 
since 1960 and has grown to 
become one of the nation’s 

largest outdoor summer fairs, 
attracting hundreds of thou-
sands of visitors each year.

Since 
the 
original 
fair’s 

inception, three more art fairs 
have been scheduled to occur 
at the same time: the Ann Arbor 
Art Fair, the State Street Art 
Fair and the South University 
Art Fair. Each exists as its own 
separate fair as a part of a larger 
event throughout the city.

Ann Arbor Police Depart-

ment Lieutenant Renee Bush 
said the city has prepared for 
the expected crowds by station-

ing more police on duty as a way 
to ensure public safety.

“We’ve been doing this for 

years,” Bush said. “We’ve pre-
pared with extra patrolling. 
The Art Fair is an extremely 
popular event — between 300 to 
400 thousand people could be 
in the city for it.”

Bush also cautioned that, 

while the fair will be phenom-
enal, visitors should take the 
necessary precautions to ensure 
a healthy stay in the city.

Summer in Ann Arbor is a different 

beast from its school year counterpart. 
The pace slows, with many Univer-
sity students returning home or going 
elsewhere, the sidewalks thin and the 
town’s median age seems to rise. Yet, 
the 56-year old Ann Arbor Art Fair 
seems to mark the town in a way that 
makes July feel as rowdy as autumn’s 
Football Saturdays, punctuating this 
time of year with a signature touch of 
Ann Arbor culture and camaraderie.

Art Fair encapsulates what is 

essentially four different fairs — The 
Ann Arbor Street Fair, Ann Arbor 
State Street Fair, Ann Arbor Summer 
Art Fair and the Ann Arbor South 
University Fair — for a long weekend 
of showcasing over 1,000 artists as 
well as live entertainment, demon-
strations, local museum and gallery 
openings and interactive cultural 
activities.

Maureen Riley has been the 

Executive Director of the Ann Arbor 
Street Fair since 2010 and previously 
directed the Detroit Festival of the 
Arts. In a phone interview with the 
the Daily, she identified this year’s 
biggest change as a move from the

At Republican Convention, Michigan 
delegation rallies to support Trump

Petition to halt sale of 
vacant lot rejected for 
insufficient signatures

Delegates pass 

during roll call to 
allow New York to 

crown Trump

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

CLEVELAND — The Michi-

gan delegation presented a united 
front behind Republican presi-
dential nominee Donald Trump 
despite 
brief 
confusion 
dur-

ing roll call, in which Michigan 
abstained from the vote Tuesday 
at the Republican National Con-

vention. 

Trump won the Michigan state 

primary in March, garnering sig-
nificant support in rural areas 
of the state — such as the Upper 
Peninsula — while, in Washt-
enaw County, the majority of 
voters supported Ohio Gov. John 
Kasich, a candidate who has yet 
to endorse Trump.

According to delegate Tim 

Brown, Michigan passed during 
its roll call turn — based on a cal-
culated request by the New York 
delegation — so that Michigan 
could be the state to allow Trump 
to clinch the 1,237 delegates 
needed for the official nomina-
tion. New York ultimately passed 

as well and voted later for Donald 
Trump Jr. to announce the dele-
gates needed for his father to win 
on behalf of the state.

“They were doing the math, 

and they wanted New York to be 
the state to push him over the top 
to get the amount of delegates 
he needed,” Brown said. “We 
abstained, and, as it went on, they 
realized they still had enough. 
They were going to do that to a 
couple of other states too.”

Confusion over Michigan’s pass 

echoed across the floor as rumors 
spread on social media concern-
ing the state’s motivations. Many 
believed it was attempting to help 
New York, but others questioned 

the unity of the delegates.

Confusion persisted even on 

the floor itself as the same the-
ories circulated. Joseph Thor-
rez, guest of the delegation, told 
The Daily he believed the issue 
was a lack of consensus among 
delegates.

“They wanted to get all of 

the votes corrected,” he said. 
“Another ballot was cast to all 
the delegates, and they had a 
recount.”

Thorrez 
was 
later 
cor-

rected by John Taylor, delegate 
and chairman of the Washtenaw 
Republican Party, who confirmed 
the maneuver was an attempt to 
help New York.

Despite the confusion, the 

various members of the Michigan 
delegation reaffirmed the state’s 
support of the Republican nomi-
nee, as 51 of 59 ultimately voted 
for Trump.

Taylor said that, despite his 

commitment as a delegate to 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas), he will 
work to unify Washtenaw County 
around the Republican nominee.

“He was not my first choice,” 

he said. “But of course we will get 
behind our nominee.”

Brown said Michigan delegates 

all feel the need to unify around 
Trump as the nominee.

“The delegates of Michigan 

have come to realize we can’t play 
around anymore,” he said. “We 
have to be united. I think there 
were six for Cruz and two for 
Kasich, but at this point it doesn’t 
matter anymore.”

Michigan delegation confusion 

came in wake chaos that erupted 
Monday on the convention floor 
over a movement by members of 

Petitioners vow to 
continue fight to 

build downtown park

By ISHI MORI

Daily Staff Reporter

A petition demanding to halt 

the sale of a city-owned park-
ing lot to a private developer did 
not have enough certifiable sig-
natures to be placed on Novem-
ber’s general election ballot, the 
City Clerk’s Office ruled Friday.

The petition was filed June 

6 by the Ann Arbor Committee 
for the Community Commons, a 
citizen group that aims to build 
a civic center commons on the 

Fifth Avenue library parking lot. 
The parking lot, which is located 
in a coveted area of downtown, 
has been a matter of intense 
debate between residents who 
feel the downtown area needs 
more high-rise buildings to 
grow further and those who are 
satisfied with the existing state 
of low-rise shops.

According to City Clerk Jac-

queline Beaudry, the petition 
fell short of the required 4,616 
signatures — 5 percent of reg-
istered voters — required after 
accounting for circulator errors, 
duplicate or incomplete signa-
tures, and signatures from peo-
ple who are registered outside 
city limits. Approximately 5,700

Profiles of faculty members, departments 
and research at University Medical School 

Ward 4 City Council race challenges incumbent’s leadership

Researchers 

continue to focus on 
addressing pressing 

health issues

By ALEXA ST.JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Last fiscal year, the Univer-

sity of Michigan Health System 
saw more than 2.1 million outpa-
tient visits. The patients received 
a range of care with new and 
innovative technologies— from 
psychiatric to orthopedic, car-
diovascular and surgical — and 
the University Hospital offered 
its services and resources in an 
attempt to find successful treat-
ments and cures.

With a $466 million research 

budget, a campus larger than 
11 million square feet, 1,000 
licensed patient beds and more 
than 26,000 faculty, students 
and volunteers that make up the 
University Health System, it is no 
question why many of the Medical 
School’s departments consistently 
rank with those of other competi-

tive schools nationwide. At the 
Medical School, researchers and 
professors continue to focus on 
constructing innovative solutions 
to society’s most troubling health 
problems. 

Today, researchers and admin-

istrators at the University Medi-
cal School continue to further the 
goals set forth since its opening in 
1850 and the opening of the Uni-
versity’s hospital in 1869 — the 
first program in the United States 
to have established and operated 
its own hospital at the time to 
learn and teach.

Depression Center — 

Veteran’s Health

In 1906, one of the nation’s 

first psychiatry departments was 
established at the University. In 
2001, the University’s Depression 
Center became the nation’s first 
comprehensive center of its kind. 
Established to bring depression to 
the forefront of medical research 
and public discussion, the cen-
ter has received multiple honors 
for research on adolescent brain 
development, substance use and 
more. Recent honors include the 
Center’s selection as one of 13 sites 
to launch a landmark study on 

substance abuse and adolescent 
brain development, in addition to 
the induction of several faculty 
members into the University 2015 
League of Educational Excel-
lence. 

Housed in the Rachel Upjohn 

Building, the Depression Center 
is dedicated to multiple aspects 
of understanding mental illness, 
including research, treatment, 
education 
and 
public 
policy. 

Aimed at reducing the stigma that 
often accompanies mental ill-
nesses, the center welcomes those 
suffering from depression, suicide 
survivors and college students.

There is also a distinct focus 

on veteran’s mental health. Amy 
Kilbourne, 
University 
profes-

sor of psychiatry and director 
of the Veterans Affairs Quality 
Enhancement Research Initiative 
Program, said a focus on veteran 
mental health is crucial particu-
larly due to the growing veteran 
population in the United States. 
According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, the 2009 to 2013 Ameri-
can Community Survey revealed 
21.3 million veterans live in the 
United States and Puerto Rico — a 
total of 9 percent of the popula-

tion. Due to to this consistently 
increasing population, the VA 
changed its focus to strictly pri-
mary care services, and QUERI 
was established in 1998. 

Kilbourne, who represents the 

national QUERI program office 
in Ann Arbor, hopes to bridge 
the gap between her interest in 
psychiatry and veteran care. She 
added that sometimes the only 
provider of mental health services 
for veterans is the VA, and, con-
sequently, QUERI often co-spon-
sors suicide prevention programs 
and evaluates the best strategies 
of implementation for suicide pre-
vention.

However, this is not the only 

aspect of veteran health QUERI 
works to advance.

“The goal of QUERI is to 

improve veteran’s health, and, 
in order to accomplish that goal, 
QUERI promotes the more rapid 
implementation of research into 
routine care practice,” Kilbourne 
said. “We do that primarily by 
funding a national network of VA 
affiliated investigators who are 

Two residents 
running for 

Councilmember 
Krapohl’s seat

By KEVIN LINDER

Daily Staff Reporter

City Councilmember Graydon 

Krapohl (D–Ward 4), who ran 
unopposed in his original 2014 
election, faces two separate chal-
lenges for his council seat from res-
idents dissatisfied with what they 
describe as his ineffectual leader-
ship. However, he argues it is mere-
ly his brand of centrist pragmatism.

Both Eric Lipson and Diane 

Giannola are challenging Kraphol 
for his seat. Whomever emerges the 
victor of the Aug. 2 Democratic pri-
mary election will most likely claim 
the seat unopposed in November.

In a recent forum hosted by the 

League of Women Voters, the three 

candidates came together to dis-
cuss their positions on these issues. 
Lipson and Giannola tended to hold 
conflicting proposals for solutions 
to issues facing the council, where-
as incumbent candidate Krapohl 
tended to hold a neutral position.

The topic of development high-

lighted where these two candidates 
differ. Giannola is a supporter of 
growth in density, pushing for the 
development of a large building 
complex at the downtown library 
lot. Lipson opposes this and sup-
ports maintaining green space and 
constrained growth.

However, both Lipson and Gian-

nola share a discontent with the 
current state of affairs on City 
Council.

Giannola, a 20-year resident and 

current manager of the Univer-
sity’s Venture Accelerator, believes 
the current City Council currently 
lacks an aspect of customer service 
and that it operates to push agendas 
through, rather than communicate 
and work with residents on their 

issues.

“Overall, the mentality seems to 

me that they don’t see it as a service 
job and more that they have been 
appointed to this to pass the initia-
tives,” she said in an interview with 
the Daily.

She feels strongly that com-

munication with residents is lack-
ing, primarily because many City 
Council members do not put forth 
the effort. Particularly, she believes 
there is no meaningful constitu-
ent service in Ward 4 from its City 
Council delegation.

“Graydon is non-existent from 

what I can tell,” she said.

Both challengers have expressed 

concerns about what they described 
as Krapohl’s neutral, “wait and see” 
approach to how issues unfold.

Lipson, a 40-year resident who 

has acted as city planning commis-
sioner and director of Student Legal 
Services, said in an interview with 
the Daily he believes that many 
City Council members, including 
Krapohl, do not vote decisively. He 

believes his competitor’s voting 
habits are non-conducive to taking 
actual steps forward toward solu-
tions for on-going issues such as 
the dioxane plume and the lack of 
transparency around the proposed 
train station development.

“There are some members who 

are more independent than others,” 
Lipson said. “And there are some 
members, such as my competi-
tor the incumbent that I am run-
ning against, who vote along the 
party line and are aligned with the 
mayor.”

Krapohl, a former Marine and 

self-proclaimed pragmatist, says 
that he votes in line with the mayor 
for logical reasons, not for political 
reasons.

“I don’t fly by the seat of my 

pants,” Krapohl said in an inter-
view with the Daily. “When I talk 
at Council, I try to get to root prob-
lems and not treat symptoms. I tend 
to align with the mayor because I 
think philosophically on a number 
of issues I agree with that approach; 

I don’t think that’s bad.”

Krapohl, who was born in Ann 

Arbor and has extensively played a 
role in city government during his 
time as a resident, has served on the 
Ann Arbor Parks Commission and 
as a Neighborhood Watch coordi-
nator. While on City Council, he has 
served on the Human Rights Com-
mission and the Local Development 
Finance Authority.

“I think my experience and per-

spective is different from the other 
two candidates, and I think that 
both of them seem to be very issue 
oriented and to some extent have an 
agenda” Krapohl said.

Both Lipson and Giannola have 

focused on particular areas of inter-
est during their campaigns and 
have expressed that they intend 
to take immediate action on these 
issues if they are to be elected. Lip-
son wants to take immediate action 
toward addressing the spreading 
dioxane plume dealing with issues 
of transparency concerning the

NOWICKI

Make America work again?

CLEVELAND — After a Monday 

filled with delegate dissidents 
and 
spousal 
plagiarism, 
the 

Tuesday slogan 
of 
“Make 

America Work 
Again” seemed 
prescient. The 
Republican 
National Convention needed to get 
back on track — it, too, needed to 
work. The theme of the night was 
supposed to be economic issues, 
highlighting 
the 
Republican 

platform for job safety and growth. 
With high-profile speakers such 
as Mitch McConnell and Chris 
Christie, the night held promise 
for at least the acknowledgment of 
concrete policy changes.

Immediately, it became clear 

that this would not be the case. 
McConnell truly did not use 
his position as Senate majority 
leader to advocate for changes to 
entitlement programs or typically 
conservative goals. He used his 
position from behind the podium 
instead to rail against Hillary 
Clinton, 
highlighting 
mainly 

her flip-flopping and her private 
e-mail server scandal. He didn’t 
describe his goals, the party’s 
goals or Trump’s goals for actually 
beating Clinton. Rather, he just 
seemed to care a heck of a lot that 
she didn’t win.

Chris Christie launched what he 

called a “prosecution” of Clinton. 
Listing off Clinton’s record, fact-
checked by the New York Times, 
he incited a gleefully raucous 
electricity into the air, spurning 
chants, dances and squeals from 
Trump-drunk supporters fueled 
by hatred, fear, lack of education 
and the July heat. Attendees 
sitting near me in the stands stood 
up and danced, clenching their 
fists in the air and tossing their 
heads back as if they finally were 
understood. Chris Christie, the 
governor of a state with the third 
highest per-capita income in the 
nation, didn’t discuss policies for 
economic mobility. The governor 
of a state with the second-highest 
concentration of millionaires in 
the nation didn’t mention his plans 
for making more of the country 
into 
millionaires, 
much 
less 

his plans to reduce regulations 
for businesses and millionaires 
alike. He didn’t outline anything 
concrete. Christie basked in his 
own spectacle, failing to shed 
light on the policies of the man 
under whose shadow he will 
permanently reside.

Trump’s 
daughter, 
Tiffany, 

focused on her father’s leadership 
qualities as a businessman, rather 
than any actual substance of how 
he could translate them into a 
quality economy. Donald Trump Jr. 
talked about how his dad ensured 
he knew how to lay drywall and 
carry a hammer and be a real salt-
of-the-earth construction worker. 
He said this while dressed in a 
shirt with a literal blue collar and 
failed to provide insight into how 
his father would share the great 
secrets of construction with the 
rest of America. General manager 
of Trump Winery, Kerry Woolard, 
mentioned Trump’s ability to 
work under pressure, without 
delving into any specifics on 
Trump’s or any other plan to ease 
the pressure of the working class 
in America. Sen. Shelley Moore 
Capito of West Virginia talked at 
length about how Clinton dislikes 
the mining industry and how this 
will ruin the economy of Capito’s 
state but failed to point out what 
Trump 
would 
specifically 
do 

differently.

Making America work again 

could have been a catchy twist on 
Trump’s slogan-filled dilettante 
of a campaign, if not for two key 
flaws. First, America was put 
back to work already. President 
Obama did exactly that, which is 
why the country now experiences 
only a 5.5 percent unemployment 
rate 
as 
opposed 
to 
nearly 

double that during the Great 
Recession. America is at work 
and is continuing to do so with 
job growth continuing steadily 
as it has over the past several 
years of Obama’s administration. 
Second, the Republicans failed to 
coalesce around any real strategy 
for putting Americans to work. 
Apart from blue-collar pandering 
from 
millionaires, 
platitudes 

about leadership qualities and 
demonizing of the opposition, the 
Republicans failed to coalesce 
around any economic issue at 
all. The only strand of unity 
that ran consistent throughout 
the night was a distaste for 
Secretary Clinton. I’m not sure 
how disliking an opponent is a 
legitimate party platform, much 
less one that will put America to 
work. If increasing American jobs 
was as simple as increasing hatred 
for public figures, unemployment 
would have been extinct long ago.

There are a lot of reasons to 

be terrified of Donald Trump 
and the movement his campaign 
created. He has called for the 
flat-out ban of an entire religious 
group from the country, has said 
he would punch protesters at his 
rallies and his vocabulary seems 
to lack the words for an apology. 
But on display in Cleveland at the 
Republican National Convention 
this week was a new terror: 
the seemingly-gleeful attitude 
that 
the 
now-mainstream 

Republican Party has taken to 
their new nominee, and the lack 
of awareness that the GOP has 
departed from standard rational 
discourse.

Presidential 
conventions 

are supposed to be unifying 
moments for their parties. After 
a long-fought battle, the party 
can finally come together and 
agree to support one candidate 
for the presidential election. In 
the standard game of politics, 
the logic follows that the party 
should support the will of the 
general populace of the party. 
But 
2016 
has 
thrown 
that 

standard rule book out the 
window. 
Wednesday, 
Trump 

advisor Al Baldasaro suggested 
that opponent Hillary Clinton 
should be executed by firing 
squad (Trump’s spokesman said 
Trump disagreed, but thanked 
Baldasaro for his support).

Yet 
Trump’s 
seeming 

ignorance 
of 
the 
standard 

ways of being a candidate 
is what’s gaining him more 
attraction. 
The 
party 
that 

endlessly 
touted 
being 
the 

party of Lincoln now seems 
bent on ripping establishment 
practices to shreds in favor 
of 
loud-mouthed 
rhetoric. 

This departure from norms 
has been riling up convention 
attendees speech after speech, 
as speakers adopted Trump’s 
rhetoric and lack of affection 
for 
facts 
in 
attempting 
to 

prosecute Clinton on stage and 
suggesting that she associates 
with Lucifer.

Many 
republicans 
skipped 

the 
convention 
altogether. 

Republican primary candidates 
including Marco Rubio and 
John Kasich, former presidents 
George W. Bush and George 
H.W. Bush, Gov. Rick Snyder 
and scores of other Republican 

leaders all did not attend the 
convention either under protest 
or with a variety of other 
excuses. Taking their place 
as primetime representatives 
of the GOP, however, was an 
arena filled with supporters 
more than willing to scream 
their support for all that Trump 
stands for.

While I may not share many 

beliefs with the Republican 
Party, this development still 
brings me great disappointment. 
Part of America’s greatness has 
involved the ability for two 
parties to engage in serious 
debates over the issues. That 
America is not being made 
great again in GOP’s decision 
to follow Trump over the ledge 
in verbally supporting racist 
remarks, dubious conspiracy 
theories and violent events. 
While the Republican Party 
may appear to be jolly in 
support for their nominee this 
week, this week demonstrates 
that the GOP is no longer the 
institution it once was.

I 

was not super excited when 
I heard that Marvel was 
making a new Spider-Man 

movie. For a 
little while, I 
was 
holding 

out hope that 
Donald Glover 
would be cast as the titular role, 
but when I found out that Tom 
Holland, a pretty average looking 
white boy (no offense) had been 
cast, I mostly lost interest. 
Recently I got in an argument 
with my uncle, who is totally in 
favor of casting Tom Holland, 
about the relevance of a new 
Spider-Man movie.

For my uncle, this new reboot 

meant a chance to finally get 
the Spider-Man of his childhood 
right. For my uncle, Spider-Man 
held quite a bit of significance 
— as he grew up in real life, 
so did Spidey in the comics he 
was reading. All of the teenage 
drama 
that 
my 
uncle 
went 

through, Spider-Man also went 
through, and he was able to 
share in Spidey’s ups and downs. 
In this way, it was almost as if 
my uncle had a companion who 
he grew up with, someone who 
could reflect the struggles he, 
as a teenage boy with a single 
mom, underwent. I’m sure that it 
means a lot to my uncle that his 
childhood companion is finally 
getting a movie where he wasn’t 
cast as a handsome adult man 
but as an awkward and scrawny, 
and therefore more relatable, 
teenager.

I 
was 
touched 
by 
my 

uncle’s 
explanation, 
but 
to 

me, this movie still remained 
unnecessary. I couldn’t shake the 
spiteful feeling that white, cis, 
heterosexual men already had 
enough movies that explained, 
organized and made relevant 

their experiences. To be honest, 
I was a little jealous. While the 
stories of white women are just 
beginning to be told, and the 
stories of persons of color, trans 
people and people who identify 
as LGBTQ are still considered 
refreshing, Hollywood decided 
to make another movie about a 
straight white boy going through 
puberty. It doesn’t make me 
upset that they made another 
Spider-Man movie, it makes me 
upset that they made a third 
reboot of the life and times of 
Peter Parker while the stories of 
Kamala Khan, Natasha Romanoff 
and many others are still waiting 
for their Hollywood treatment.

But why is this important? I 

mean, why does it really matter 
whether or not we see the same 
stories over and over again, or 
if we get to see some diversity 
in major movie productions? 
In 
her 
documentary 
Miss 

Representation, Jennifer Siebel 
Newsom states, “You can’t be 
what you can’t see,” and I think 
that this quote does a good job 
of explaining why diversity is 
important in film. For example, in 
my mind it was understood that if 
a man was yelling at a woman, the 
woman always just had to wait 
until it was over — she couldn’t 
fight back or tell him to calm 
down — until I watched “Thelma 
and Louise.” I didn’t grow up in 
a household where there were a 
lot of men yelling at women, so I 
must have learned this standard 
from the macho-man movies that 
my family used to watch. But 
then, one family movie night, we 
watched “Thelma and Louise” 
and one scene in particular stuck 
with me. In this scene, Thelma 
is confronted by her boyfriend 
Jimmy, who demands to know 
why he was asked to wire her 

money (SPOILER ALERT: it’s 
because Louise and Thelma are 
on the run for murdering a guy). 
She says that she won’t tell him, 
and he throws the typical film 
alpha male fit — throwing stuff 
around the room and swearing. 
Louise responds by saying, “You 
start this shit, I’m out of here,” 
and heads toward the door. It 
was an important and defining 
moment in my childhood because 
it taught me that, as a woman, 
I could stand up for myself in 
the face of angry men. But it 
happened when I was about 
13 — I didn’t grow up believing 
that I could show my strength 
in the face of men. All the other 
female-led movies I had watched 
up until that point had been 
pseudo-feminist 
romances 
or 

princess movies. Young people of 
all identities should be able to see 
themselves reflected on screen 
in roles that are empowering and 
authoritative.

Just to be clear: I’m definitely 

not opposed to the new Spider-
Man 
movie. 
Honestly, 
I’m 

probably going to go see and 
will most likely enjoy it (I’m 
a sucker for both teen movies 
and superhero movies). And 
I’m really glad that a movie 
is finally getting the Spider-
Man universe right, according 
to my uncle. But after this 
movie has been made, I hope 
that Hollywood starts making 
more movies that validate the 
experience of non-cis, -white, 
-straight, -heterosexual men. 
I hope that we start viewing 
franchises 
as 
a 
chance 
to 

increase diversity. Mostly, I 
just hope that we start seeing 
stories from new points of view.

Inspiring movies for all

“goals” rolled off my teacher’s 
tongue, I knew what my goal 
was: to look out for and care 
for others. Afterward, when 
we shared our goals amongst 
some of our peers, I read my 
goal aloud to a trusted friend. 
Immediately, 
she 
made 
a 

face, telling me my goal was 
supposed to be about myself. 
And in retrospect, she was 
right. While wanting to help 
people is always important, you 
should save an important place 
in your life for yourself.

As a young kid who was 

taught that I should always 
look out for the needs of others, 
anything 
that 
seemed 
even 

remotely about helping oneself 
above others I looked down 
on. Self-care wasn’t something 
I really ever thought about. I 
strove for this perfect person 
who did everything for others, 
disregarding how it may affect 
me, and I know now, that won’t 
serve anyone in the long run. 

Self-care is not synonymous 

with being selfish. It doesn’t 

mean that you are a slacker, 
you don’t care for others or 
want everything to revolve 
around you. It means that while 
you work your hardest to help 
others, 
you 
also 
remember 

that your health and wellbeing 
matter. It doesn’t need to be one 
or the other — helping others or 
focusing on yourself.

Take time to practice self-

care. It’s important.

Prioritizing self-care
A 

few days ago, a close 
friend from school came 
to visit me, and I wanted 

to 
show 

her 
where 

I 
worked. 

Walking 
toward 
the 

office, I got 
tense. I started to feel self-
conscious, like if I went into 
work and my coworkers and 
supervisors saw me there with 
my friend, they would question 
why I took time off. And as these 
thoughts swam around in my 
head, I began to feel nervous, 
bad, guilty — even anxious. 
I should be there helping or 
doing something else important 
if I’m not at the office. As we 
approached the door to my office, 
I almost wanted to scream out: 
“Stop! Let’s not bother them, 
why don’t I show you campus 
instead?”

As I walked into the office, I 

wasn’t greeted with glares and 
judgmental stares (completely a 
product of my own imagination) 
but 
instead 
smiles, 
and 
I 

remembered the workshop we’d 
had at work a few weeks back. 
The lawyers had arranged for 
a psychologist to come into the 
office to answer our questions 
and advise us on how to speak 
with traumatized clients. Part 
way through the workshop, after 
giving us tips about the best ways 
to communicate with clients, she 
switched the conversation to us.

How do we keep from getting 

burnt out? How do we separate 
work from our lives at home? 
Almost immediately, one lawyer 
said, “You can’t help anyone else 
before you help yourself.”And 
while a younger version of myself 
wouldn’t have understood, and 
maybe even thought it seemed 
selfish, it was a relief to hear this. 
As I think about it now, I realize 
how important this idea was to 
hold on to.

After a long day at work, 

you’re tired and feel spent. When 
someone asks you for a favor, 
though, your first reaction is 
to jump to help. But it’s alright, 
even necessary, to take a moment 
and decide: Can I do this now? 
It is OK to take a break, to ask 
for a break, to need a break. We 
need to practice self-care above 
all else, because if we don’t, how 
much help will we be to others? 
This has taken me a long time to 

realize, and I still need to remind 
myself of this every day when I’m 
hard on myself for not working 
that extra hour or for taking that 
extra day or not volunteering to 
help someone because I had to 
be somewhere else. And not only 
will we better help others, but we 
need to realize that our health, 
simply because it’s our health, is 
important.

Before I go further, I want to 

acknowledge that for many it is 
not so simple to just “take a break” 
because they need to work, or 
those they care for have no one 
else. And while I do write from 
a place of privilege, being able 
to set strong limits in my place 
of work and have other support 
systems, I believe there are ways 
for anyone to practice self-care, 
big and small. Even if it is taking 
a five-minute walk, having an 
extra cookie or breathing deeply 
for a minute, it is well worth it 
and too important to ignore.

We are taught to be selfless, 

give without expecting anything 
in return; otherwise, we are 
often told we are selfish. And 
there is no question that those 
who give their lives to help others 
should 
receive 
high 
praises 

for their work. But while it is 
very important we realize our 
privileges and that we have a duty 
to help those in need in the ways 
we can, it is also equally crucial 
to remember how important your 
own health and wellbeing are. 
In fact, it may even give you the 
strength and the ability to help 
others even more than you might 
have if you didn’t practice self-
care. We must include self-care 
as an important aspect of our 
lives. 

The first (and only time) I 

listened to the safety video on an 
airplane, I thought it was weird 
they told you to put your oxygen 
mask on before helping others. I 
said to myself that I’d be selfless 
and brave and help someone 
before myself. Of course you 
should help your child or sister 
or friend before yourself. In fact, 
I asked my mom when I was 
younger why they wanted us to 
do that. Isn’t that selfish? She 
explained that it was because you 
would be better suited to help 
others. Even though it makes 
sense now, it didn’t then.

Then in freshman year of high 

school, we were asked to make 
goals for ourselves. As soon as

‘Suits’ ill-fitted

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

Can anyone explain what hap-

pened to “Suits”? I’m struggling to 
come up with why the show is still 
running 
and 

why they decid-
ed to substan-
tially 
remove 

the drama from 
where it was 
at its creative 
peak. This sea-
son 
premiere 

didn’t feel like 
the 
“Suits” 
I 

fell in love with 
when it first premiered. It’s a com-
pletely different show, with a tone 
that feels unfamiliar and, quite 
frankly, wrong.

Season six picks right up where 

season five left off, with Mike Ross 
(SAG Award Nominee Patrick J. 
Adams, “Orphan Black”) adjusting 
to prison after pleading guilty to 
fraudulently practicing law despite 
not being an actual lawyer last sea-
son, and Pearson Specter Litt deal-
ing with the consequences of pretty 
much all their staffers leaving as a 
result of a deal gone wrong.

In preparation for the season six 

premiere, I binged the last six epi-
sodes of “Suits” ’s fifth season that 
aired last winter and it felt like the 
series was preparing for its end-
game. Where can this show go after 
permanently separating the show’s 
two leads in Mike and Harvey Spec-
ter (Gabriel Macht, “The Spirit”) 
after having Mike’s guilty plea? 
Doesn’t that mean it just blew up its 
whole premise? The drama seemed 
lost during its premiere, trying to 
rediscover its tone with its new arcs 
while seeming to struggle greatly.

Mike’s prison story is what felt the 

most off-base from what “Suits” has 
done before. The premiere shows 
him trying to adjust to a new way of 
life and a new group of people while 

imprisoned. It’s embarking on a dark 
storyline, especially as Mike gets 
tricked by his original cellmate Frank 
(Paul Schulze, “24”) into telling his 
life story and texting his girlfriend 
Rachel (Meghan Markle, “Fringe”) 
from the man’s phone. Frank then 
reveals himself as someone Harvey 
is responsible for imprisoning, and 
that he’ll use this information to get 
back at him through Mike. A story 
of having Mike deal with villains in 
prison feels distinctly different from 
what the show used to be. The series 
invokes “Shawshank Redemption” a 
lot in these scenes, but it’s not nearly 
at the level of the movie it’s referenc-
ing.

Where “Suits” gives glimmers of 

hope is in its story involving Har-
vey, Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres, 
“Firefly), Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 
“Samantha Who?”), Donna (Sarah 
Rafferty, “Brothers & Sisters”) and 
Rachel trying to recover everyone 
from leaving. “Suits” is at its best 
when it throws an intriguing chal-
lenge at its lawyers while simulta-
neously watching them dig their 
way out of it, and elements of this 
idea were at play in the premiere’s 
storyline. Additionally, the moment 
where Louis accidentally gets some 
of his late assistant’s ashes on his 
face is one of the few moments 
where the episode allowed itself to 
loosen up and be humorous.

In this story, the show didn’t 

double down on its misery. It didn’t 
force the characters into situations 
where they’re not allowed to be 
happy, like it did for most of last sea-
son and it’s doing to Mike with the 
prison storyline. They’ve jettisoned 
the character off onto his own show 
and they’re struggling to figure out 
what it should be. Honestly, I might 
be done with the show at this point, 
because once they made this choice, 
there’s no way the show can reunite 
and become what it once was, even 
if there are hints of what I enjoyed 
about the show still existing.

TV REVIEW

What’s next for Nintendo?

VIDEO GAMES COLUMN

Y

ou know what Pokémon 
Go is. If you haven’t 
noticed the people 

around you playing it, you’ve 
probably read one of the thou-
sands of news 
articles cover-
ing its meteoric 
rise to the top 
of the app store 
and its gar-
gantuan rev-
enue stream. 
According to 
CNBC, it’s the 
biggest mobile 
game in the 
history of the 
United States. There’s not much 
more to say about the game that 
hasn’t been said — it’s a bona 
fide cultural phenomenon. And, 
as someone who follows gaming 
culture very closely, it’s been 
wonderful to see.

However, as fascinating 

as it has been to watch 
Pokémon retake the cultural 
consciousness both locally and 
internationally, I have to say 
that I’m even more interested 
in seeing how Nintendo handles 
its current boost in fame and 
fortune. Long story short, I 
think they’re already failing 
to capitalize on their biggest 
opportunity ever.

Even though Pokémon Go 

wasn’t developed or published 
internally at Nintendo (instead 
developed by Niantic, Inc., 
which Nintendo owns a stake in), 
the resurgence in the popularity 
of the Pokémon brand has still 
managed to double Nintendo’s 
stock price. Apparently you can 
hear Silicon Valley executives 
salivating from as far west as 
Arkansas.

But, like any smash hit on the 

app store, Pokémon Go won’t 
be able to keep its grasp on the 
zeitgeist forever. Observing the 
stories of fly-by-night app boom 
companies like the currently 
gasping-for-air Zynga shows a 
distinct trend of initially massive 
hits in mobile and social gaming 
that fail to recapture their early 
successes. If Nintendo wants to 
fully capitalize on their enviable 
situation, they need to make 
several significant moves sooner 
rather than later.

First and foremost, Nintendo 

needs to announce NX right 
now. Like, within the next two 

weeks. It’s already baffling 
that Nintendo hasn’t even 
announced the real name of 
their still-codenamed console, 
which is due to be released in 
March 2017. If they want to 
turn around the rather rough 
story their hardware sales 
numbers are telling (Wii U has 
sold around 13 million units 
worldwide, a little more than a 
tenth of what the original Wii 
sold), they need to jump on their 
worldwide news media attention 
and provide details on their next 
big hardware launch as soon as 
possible. It’s not like they’ll lose 
out on coverage from the games-
specific press if they put out 
the news in the fall. The IGNs 
and the Gamespots of the world 
will hound Nintendo’s every 
decision regardless of when or 
where it happens. What they 
will lose out on is a significant 
portion of the mainstream 
press — your EWs, your Us 
Weeklys. All of these influential 
outlets are rubbernecking in 
Nintendo’s direction right now, 
but they’ll turn their heads back 
toward the highway if Nintendo 
doesn’t work their magic with a 
hardware press conference soon.

Nintendo also needs to find 

a way to load Pokémon Sun and 
Moon — the new main-series 
Pokémon games — into Pokémon 
Go’s powerful trebuchet. While 
the more traditional Pokemon 
games never really stopped 
selling big (Pokémon X and Y for 
Nintendo 3DS sold an impressive 
15 million units), they haven’t 
done the ridiculous numbers the 
original games did back in the 
late ’90s, never mind the mind-
boggling numbers Go is doing on 
the App Store. If Nintendo can 
correctly maneuver the message 
around their new games, 
perhaps even by promoting 
within the Pokémon Go app, 
they might be able to massively 
boost their sales even past what 
they were in the first generation. 
It’s really their only chance to 
come out of this holiday season 
in the black, since both the NX 
hardware and their new “Legend 
of Zelda” game aren’t releasing 
until next year.

Finally, Nintendo should 

attempt to understand the 
social aspect of Pokémon Go 
and incorporate it into future 
software and hardware. 

Nintendo has always been a 
company notoriously behind 
the curve with social and online 
features — the Wii was maligned 
for requiring lengthy “friend 
codes” to connect with other 
players online, and neither 
it nor the Wii U has offered 
any sort of social networking 
comparable with the online 
ecosystem of Playstation 
4, Xbox One or Steam. To 
this end, Pokémon Go has 
demonstrated that it has power 
far beyond financial. It shows 
that Nintendo’s brands have 
the ability to connect people in 
droves — to bring people from 
diverse walks of life together 
under one big geeky umbrella. 
If Nintendo could learn to 
make something powerful and 
interesting out of people’s shared 
love of their games (perhaps a 
functional online profile and 
chat functionality for their next 
console?) they could drastically 
improve the future of their 
hardware.

Besides a few tweets about 

the next Pokémon game’s roster, 
the only news we’ve heard 
from Nintendo post-Pokémon 
Go is the announcement of 
their “NES Classic Edition,” a 
replica of their iconic ’80s home 
console that’s bundled with 30 
digital games. It’s a lukewarm 
announcement that really only 
appeals to Nintendo’s perennial 
hardcore fanbase. Again, these 
people aren’t the ones Nintendo 
needs to be looking to right now.

This article isn’t meant to 

be a scathing criticism about 
a company I have problems 
with. On the contrary — his is a 
layman’s advice for a company 
that I care very deeply about. 
I’ve been a gigantic Nintendo fan 
for as long as I can remember, 
and I truly believe in the quality 
of the art that Nintendo’s 
talented developers create. If 
anything, Pokémon Go should 
be proof that the Big N should 
never be slept on. Just when you 
think they’re out for the count, 
they deliver a huge uppercut that 
puts them right back in the fight. 
Pokémon Go is their biggest one 
yet.

TV REVIEW
Red card for ‘Ballers’

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

Booze, 
boats 
and 
women 

constitute the opening of the 
season two premiere of “Ballers” 
and characterize 
much 
of 
the 

ostentatious 
imagery 
of 

football in all its 
professional and 
personal glory on 
the show. Though 
the partying and 
excess 
depicted 

in 
“Ballers” 

may be the TV 
incarnation of some repressed 
fantasy of what it’s like to have 
that much success and wealth, the 
show does more than just flaunt 
it. It uses tropes of the industry to 
show another side — a side where 
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who 
plays former NFL star Spencer 
Strasmore, must find fulfillment in 
his post-career life.

This desire is the driving force 

behind Spencer’s aspirations as 
he settles into his new career as 
the go-to financial manager for 
professional football players. As 
season one taught us, success 
is 
capricious 
— 
and 
Spencer 

charms his way into helping his 
clients navigate the personal and 
financial perils that come with 
overconfidently indulging in it. He 
adds a much welcomed maturity 
and depth to counter the abundant 
antics of his clients.

But even a character as measured 

and composed as Spencer begins to 
show cracks in his armor, especially 
when his past resurfaces. In the 
season two premiere, this takes the 
form of Andre Allen (Andy Garcia), a 
competing manager from Spencer’s 
financial firm who used to represent 
him and who he blames for his 
injury 
and 
ultimate 
departure 

from the league. It’s clear from the 
beginning of the episode that Andre 
will be implicated in the central 
conflict of season two both as a 
remnant from Spencer’s past and as 
new competition. At the restaurant 
opening of one of Spencer’s clients (a 
cameo appearance by Ndamukong 
Suh), Spencer refuses to even shake 
Andre’s hand.

Fittingly, Spencer’s Achilles heel 

is his pride, which is threatened by 
Andre’s belittlement of Spencer. 
But “Ballers” may have shown 
their hand too soon by openly 

identifying Andre as the primary 
conflict that will drive season 
two’s plot. After hinting later in 
the episode that Andre’s actions 
spurred the downfall of Spencer’s 
career, the mystery surrounding 
the animosity between the two is 
unceremoniously lifted and Spencer 
vows to steal all of Andre’s clients 
–– a brazen statement and a bolder 
mission characteristic of Spencer’s 
determination, cementing the roles 
both Andre and Spencer will play 
this season.

Though season one hinted at 

Spencer’s weaknesses, it’s clear the 
writers intend to trigger them in the 
current season. Johnson’s charm 
carried him through season one and 
effectively pulled together a great 
ensemble, but it appears that he’s 
shed his characteristic good nature 
in an attempt to reflect the tipping 
balance of his confidence and 
composure. However, it seems that 
both Johnson and the writers know 
that the emotional range required 
to develop Spencer’s character 
are beyond Johnson’s charismatic 
grasp, and he’s better left lashing 
out in short bursts of emotionally 
charged bravado than brooding and 
acting troubled because he hasn’t 
gotten closure on his past.

This is proven in his spat with 

football player T-Sizzle (NFL player 
Terrell Suggs), who’s represented by 
Andre, on “Glazed and Confused.” 
Sizzle manages to prod Spencer into 
a violent altercation on live television 
following a round of sharply written 
verbal 
smackdowns. 
Though 

heated, the sequence is intercut with 
reactions from Ricky (John David 
Washington, “Malcolm X”) and 
his crew, who are simultaneously 
entertained by Spencer’s comebacks 
and shocked at the crack in his 
impermeable veneer. The comic 
relief briefly allowed to us during 
the awkwardly tense interaction 
serves as a reminder that the show 
— though it addresses serious topics 
in the football industry — shouldn’t 
be taken too seriously.

While head injuries and partying 

entire fortunes away are not joking 
matters, “Ballers” is able to address 
them with both poignant brevity 
and adjunct humor. Though, these 
qualities may go unnoticed among 
gratuitous 
scenes 
of 
snorting 

coke off strippers (scenes that 
were bizarrely absent from this 
premiere). In fact, the energy in the 
premiere was lacking so sorely that 
more strippers would have been 

welcome. Maybe if greater attention 
had been given to the supporting 
cast, including the comically brash 
Joe (Rob Corddry, “Children’s 
Hospital”) and the unassumingly 
sweet Charles (Omar Benson Miller, 
“CSI: Miami”), the episode would 
have succeeded in capturing our 
interest in the overall season.

The best the show could muster 

was more contract trouble for Ricky 
and Charles, a recycled conflict that 
was already overused in season one. 
What makes the show so great is 
how Spencer and Joe manage to pull 
through for untethered characters 
like Ricky and Charles, who are 
essentially lost without Spencer’s 
well-meaning, 
but 
floundering 

guidance.

As a start for what’s been hyped 

up to be an exciting season, the 
premiere is certainly a let down. 
But then again, “Ballers” is brought 
to us by the same creators as 
“Entourage,” and has shaped up 
to be the product of an identical 
formula (just sub out Hollywood 
for the NFL). Let’s just hope that the 
Andre-Spencer conflict pans out to 
be more promising than Ricky and 
Charles’ contracts.

historic Wednesday through Satur-
day timeslot to a Thursday to Sun-
day one, anticipating the attendance 
of over 500,000 people over the four 
days.

“That’s a huge change, and it’s 

been a couple of years in the making. 
There were a lot of people involved, 
a lot of stakeholders involved in the 
decision,” she said.

Artists supported the shift and 

local businesses have jumped at the 
opportunity to benefit from Satur-
day night Art Fair patrons.

Riley highlighted aspects of the 

fair that create a singular artistic 
experience that’s constantly evolv-
ing and highly interactive.

“Every year the art is new. 

Whether it’s new artists or old 
favorites 
returning 
with 
new 

bodies of work, you’re never going 
to see the same thing from year 
to year and that’s what makes Art 
fairs exciting. If you have a favorite 
artist that you follow over the years, 
you get to watch the evolution of 
their style and technique and it 
becomes a friendship,” said Riley. 

Riley spoke about an Art piece at 

the fair that’s to take place in real 
time. “We do a large scale street 
painting, which this year is a chalk 
drawing in the style of the Ancient 
Italian Modenari and this year our 
artist is named Tess Tobolic and 

this year she is recreating Salvador 
Dali’s melting watch.”

“She’ll start creating the piece 

on Thursday and it will be done 
on Sunday and you can watch the 
progress as she creates it in chalk on 
the sidewalk on East Washington 
and Ingalls Mall,” Riley continued.

There will be a demonstration 

area on North University where 
attendants can watch artists and 
craftsman in action, taking a peek 
into an often-mysterious artistic 
process.

“It’s really a broad, broad range of 

styles and people and our visitorship 
really comes from all over the 
country, while a lot of it is from 
Michigan, 20% of our visitors come 
from out of state,” she said.

Above all else, Riley believes in 

the accessibility of the Art fair. “You 
take a thousand artists and put them 
in the streets of Ann Arbor. You find 
artwork to suit everyone’s taste and 
price point and then you add the 
unique ambiance of Ann Arbor into 
the mix and it’s just a fun time,” 
Riley said.

Ann 
Arbor 
will 
open 
its 

streets for the 57th time, letting 
local creative juices flow and 
undertaking festivities to honor the 
innovation and whimsical talent 
that brews below the surface of 
a quieter and more relaxed Ann 
Arbor populace.

City Council pushes 
to raise minimum age 
for tobacco purchase 

Councilmember 
Grand dismisses 
need for student 

input on bill

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

A resolution raising the mini-

mum age to purchase tobacco 
from 18 to 21 passed its initial read 
with only one dissenting vote at 
Monday’s Ann Arbor City Council 
meeting. The proposed legislation 
will still need to be approved by the 
council in a meeting next month 
before being fully accepted.

The proposed ordinance would 

raise the age at which Ann Arbor 
retailers may sell tobacco prod-
ucts and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21, 
while also decriminalizing under-
age tobacco possession of both.

In a phone interview prior to 

the meeting, Councilmember Julie 
Grand (D–Ward 3) — who has been 
the leading proponent of the reso-
lution — explained that, though the 
ordinance would explicitly affect 
those between ages 18 and 20, it 
would also indirectly target tobac-
co usage by younger teenagers.

“Most 15 to 17-year-olds get 

their tobacco products from 18 and 
19-year-olds or other similar social 
sources, so this ordinance helps 
block that source,” Grand said. 
“What it also does for the 18 to 
20-year-olds is it provides an onset 
barrier when those individuals 
are most likely to be moving from 
experimental tobacco use to regu-
lar or habitual tobacco use.”

Pointing to California, Hawaii 

and Massachusetts as examples, 
Grand said she hoped a municipal 
ordinance would eventually pave 
the way for other city governments 
in Michigan as well as the state 
government.

When asked why the ordinance 

was being pushed during the sum-
mer, when most University of 
Michigan students — who would 
be directly impacted by the reso-
lution — are absent from campus 
and unable to participate in public 
debate over the issue, Grand was 
dismissive of student input, say-
ing she has the backing of a broad 

coalition comprising local medical 
and public health professionals.

“My main interest is develop-

ing this model and moving it out to 
other communities,” Grand said. 
“As much as I would like to get 
the input from the University stu-
dents, that’s not my primary goal. 
And honestly, if they were against 
the ordinance, I really don’t think 
it would change my mind.”

While affected, University stu-

dents would still be able to take 
a free city bus line to Meijer on 
Ann Arbor-Saline Road, just out-
side city limits and therefore not 
subject to city ordinances, and 
purchase tobacco products there. 
Grand pointed out that in past 
cases, even if neighboring munici-
palities did not pass a similar 
ordinance, there would still be a 
decline in teenage tobacco usage.

All council members, except 

Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4), voted to 
support the first reading of the bill, 
moving it forward to be discussed 
at a second reading in the future, 
before a final vote will be held. 
Councilmember Eaton said that 
he thought the bill was a good idea 
but that he could not support it 
because of the fact that it violated 
state law.

“I am vividly aware of the cost 

of smoking, but I can’t support 
this ordinance,” Eaton said. “The 
Michigan Tobacco Products Tax 
Act says that we shall not impose 
any new requirements or prohi-
bitions pertaining to the sale of 
tobacco, and that’s exactly what 
we’re doing here. I think that 
when there’s a state law that tells 
us not to do something, we’re ill-
advised to do it regardless of how 
passionate we are about the intent 
behind the law.”

Councilmembers Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2) and Graydon Krapohl 
(D–Ward 4) also expressed con-
cerns about the conflict the ordi-
nance would create with state law 
but voted to support the first read-
ing.

Councilmember Sumi Kaila-

sapathy (D–Ward 1) asked City 
Attorney Stephen Postema what 
the legal ramifications of passing 
such an ordinance would be, but 
Postema said he wasn’t prepared 
to answer that question at the 
time.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

important. It’s supposed to be 
very hot during Art Fair this 
year,” she added. “And people 
should take caution with their 
pets too.”

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2), who served as a board 
member for the Ann Arbor Street 
Art Fair for nearly a decade, said 
the fair has grown considerably 
into a large-scale, significant 
cultural event for the city.

“I would call it an iconic event 

for our community,” Lumm said. 
“It attracts thousands and thou-
sands of visitors and hundreds of 
artists. It brings in a lot of peo-
ple, which is of course great for 
business.”

However, this year’s Art Fair 

is unlike any other before it. 
Instead of running in the tradi-
tional slot of Wednesday through 
Saturday, it instead begins on 
Thursday and concludes on Sun-
day.

“(City Council) supported that 

move,” she said. “I know this is 
something the Art Fair directors 
have been working on for a num-
ber of years … In order for this to 
occur on Sunday it was critical 
to address the concerns for the 
churches. Congregations have 
access to churches.”

In addition to addressing the 

needs of Ann Arbor citizens, the 
switch was made to further stim-
ulate business in the downtown 
where Art Fair occurs.

“I think everyone felt that 

this way it would be more cus-
tomer friendly. It’s a good move,” 
Lumm said.

While the schedule shift away 

from Art Fair’s traditional slot 

may help encourage business 
activity, Maureen Riley, execu-
tive director of the Ann Arbor 
Street Art Fair, said the change 
was a long process to implement.

“Changing the Art Fair days 

was a little bit like turning the 
Titanic — it doesn’t happen over-
night,” Riley said. “It took a lot 
of time and preparation, and we 
started that process a couple of 
years ago.”

According to Riley, the transi-

tion was a tactical move to keep 
the Art Fair accessible to people 
in modern society.

“It was a result of evaluating 

the Art Fair and it’s future and 
how to keep it sustainable and 
healthy,” she said. “One of the 
major components to that we felt 
was being open on the weekend. 
People don’t live the same life-
style they did in 1960, when we 
first opened. Stores weren’t open 
in those days on Sunday … But 
that was 57 years ago and life is a 
lot different now.”

Another large reason for the 

updated schedule was to make 
the fair more appealing to young 
people and young artists. While 
artists who’ve come to Art Fair 
to show their work are always 
encouraged to come each year, 
event organizers noticed that 
many long-time artists were 
beginning to retire and not come 
back.

“The baby boom generation is 

starting to retire, which is allow-
ing for a whole lot of new artists 
to come into this business,” Riley 
said. “We’ve been seeing that for 
the last few years and I’m sure 
that will continue. The work — 
the aesthetic in the Art Fair in 
my opinion — is appealing more 
to a younger profile than it did 
ten years ago.”

signatures were initially submit-
ted, by the group’s estimate.

The petitioners have until 

August 2 to collect additional sig-
natures, though the city’s legal 
team is unsure whether supple-
mental petitions are allowed 
under the Home Rule City Act, 
which regulates how petitions 
are filed.

Alan Haber, the leader of the 

petition, said there are several 
routes he can go if the city attor-
ney instructs the clerk to not 
accept additional signatures.

The first is to discuss and nego-

tiate with the city to validate the 
petition. In the event that fails, 
Haber said, he will appeal to the 
22nd Circuit Court and seek an 
injunction to halt any city action 
on the parking lot until the court 
rules. If the court recognizes the 
validity of the petition, the ques-
tion will most likely be put on the 
spring 2017 regular election bal-
lot.

Another strategy is to ask City 

Council to recognize the petition 
on its own initiative before the 
November 8 election. Haber said 
that City Councilmember Jack 
Eaton (D–Ward 4) is ready to 
introduce a resolution to do that 
at the August 4 meeting, which 
Eaton confirmed to the Daily in a 
phone interview.

Haber said he can also chal-

lenge some of the disqualified 
signatures to ascertain that a sig-
nature is from a registered voter 
from Ann Arbor.

Frank Wilhelme, a member 

of Haber’s group, showed opti-
mism in this strategy succeed-
ing, pointing out a discrepancy 
between state and city petition 
practices.

“A day or two ago, I saw some 

e-mail conversation about how 
state law allows one valid signa-
ture but Ann Arbor practice is to 
rule invalid the initial signature 
and any duplicates,” he said. “If 
we can prevail on this question, 
we would pick up 233 or so signa-
tures.”

In a Facebook post on Tuesday 

for the Ann Arbor Committee for 
the Community Commons, Haber 

emphasized the library lot peti-
tion is of paramount importance 
for democracy in Ann Arbor.

“Many people have cooperated 

in moving forward this effort to 
do democracy in Ann Arbor,” 
Haber wrote. “Be part of the ‘we’ 
who are trying to in-source sov-
ereignty — its (sic) ours, the pub-
lic’s — We have the right to vote 
on keeping it for a public purpose, 
or selling it.”

Haber has previously criti-

cized City Council’s perceived 
inclination for increased devel-
opment, calling it corrupt for 
ignoring residents’ voices. His 
tone was still acerbic on Tuesday.

“Sometimes 
it 
seems 
they 

would sell their mother if the 
price was right, and not even 
notice they were doing it, and 
they are trying to do that right 
now, not noticing what never-
to-be center of community they 
are selling away,…” he wrote in 
his Facebook post. “This citizen 
initiative is the alternative to 17 
floor luxury hotel/condo devel-
opment, Chicago style, or its suc-
cessor waiting to buy it out from 
under us.” (sic)

the “Never Trump” movement 
who tried to force a roll call vote. 
The motion ultimately failed by a 
controversial decision by deputy 
chair Steve Womack, who was 
presiding over the voice vote.

Michigan delegate Debra Man-

tey said she believes the “Never 
Trump” movement is composed 
of a set of delegates who are not 
loyal to their voters.

“I don’t think much of it, obvi-

ously,” she said. “I think it was 
more of a media distraction. 
There wasn’t enough of a faction 
of them to really do anything, 
and I think it’s pretty sad, really. 
These are delegates who have 

been entrusted by the people who 
have put them here to follow the 
will of the people.”

Michigan 
delegates 
also 

seemed confident in Trump’s 
ability to convert the tradition-
ally blue state into a red one come 
November.

John Haggard, Michigan del-

egate in the first district, said 
support for Trump will spread 
throughout the state so that 
Michigan votes Republican in 
November.

“Michigan will be red in the 

fall,” he said. “Donald Trump is 
going to turn the state of Michi-
gan red, and it’s going to start 
from us in the Upper Peninsula 
all the way down. It’s going to be 
like cancer, and we are going to 
spread it fast.”

proposed train station develop-
ment. Giannola wants to place City 
Council priority on the develop-
ment of the library lane lot.

While these two candidates 

have outlined specific goals that 
they want accomplished if they are 
elected, there has been open com-
ments on the fact that there has 
been a lack of any specific issues 
that 
immediately 
concern 
the 

majority of their constituents.

“On some years there are issues 

that tears the community apart,” 

Giannola said. “But this year, I don’t 
see any issues that will get people 
out to the polls, and it’s a bit worri-
some. There is not a local issue that 
matters so much to the fourth ward 
people.”

Krapohl argued that a City 

Council member driven by per-
sonal issues rather than popular 
consensus could detract from his 
or her ability to make the best deci-
sion based on facts, noting that a 
lack of support for issues driving 
candidates could lead to problems 
once they are in office.

“If you are unable to gain sup-

port for that issue, then you are 
dead in the water,” he said. “If you 

are only focused on your issues, I 
think it can cloud your judgement 
and your perspective when you 
need to get things done. It is impor-
tant to get council as a whole to 
make decisions.”

Giannola summed up what she 

found to be the fundamental differ-
ences in approach to issues.

“Graydon is making decisions 

based on what is presented to him,” 
she said. “I want to get the infor-
mation before the decision-making 
process, so it’s just a different way 
that we go after the job. Eric comes 
at it from an ‘anti’ point of view, 
he approaches issues as the devil’s 
advocate.”

2016 Schefters: Several teams rebound from down season

By MAX BULTMAN and JAKE 

LOURIM

Managing Sports Editors

A year ago, the Daily’s Schefter 

Awards, honoring the best in Michi-
gan athletics, recognized a few 
bright spots amid a mostly bleak 
year.

Among 
the 
highest-profile 

teams, the football, men’s basketball 
and hockey teams each missed the 
postseason for the first time since 
1972-73. But the struggles didn’t 
stop there: The men’s tennis team 
went 7-17, and the men’s track and 
field team finished 10th at the Big 
Ten Outdoor Championships.

For many teams, this past sea-

son was a revival. The football, 
men’s basketball and hockey teams 
each returned to their respective 
postseasons, and Carol Hutchins’ 
unstoppable 
softball 
juggernaut 

continued.

The women’s gymnastics, wom-

en’s track and field, men’s cross 
country and men’s and women’s 
swimming programs also delivered 
Big Ten titles. Adam Steinberg’s 
men’s tennis team rebuilt, as did 
Jerry Clayton’s men’s track and 
field team. Only the men’s gym-
nastics team suffered a significant 
regression, and that was after losing 
loads of talent from three dominant 

seasons that included two national 
championships.

Before the women’s soccer team 

kicks off the next Michigan athlet-
ics season Aug. 19 against Pitts-
burgh, here are this year’s awards, 
named after one of the Daily’s most 
prominent alumni, ESPN NFL 
insider Adam Schefter:

Best Cinderella Story: Steve 

Racine, ice hockey

Racine’s comeback story almost 

never happened, because there 
was almost nothing from which he 
needed to come back. Racine nearly 
capped his freshman season with a 
Cinderella run to extend Michigan’s 
22-year NCAA Tournament streak. 
It was the closest the Wolverines 
had been to missing the postseason, 
and thus it would have been one of 
the most memorable trips.

In 2013, Michigan entered the 

CCHA 
Tournament 
at 
13-18-3 

after a miserable regular season. 
They could only stay alive by rid-
ing Racine, their stand-in freshman 
goaltender, to an unlikely CCHA 
Tournament title. But the seventh-
seeded Wolverines began by sweep-
ing No. 10 seed Northern Michigan, 
and they made the final weekend by 
upsetting No. 3 seed. They reached 
the finals by stunning No. 1 seed 
Miami (Ohio), 6-2, in the semifinals. 
Only a championship loss to Notre 

Dame halted what would have 
been an incredible start to Racine’s 
career, but it also became the image 
of the 22-year streak ending.

Still, the forecast on the fresh-

man netminder was promising. 
Surely, many thought, carrying the 
momentum of that run, the Wol-
verines would return to the NCAA 
Tournament the following year.

But in the following two years, 

Racine could never recapture the 
magic of that CCHA Tournament 
run. He played fewer games in 
both seasons than he did as a fresh-
man, and his goals-against average 
worsened from 2.65 to 2.91 to 2.94. 
He only had one more try to help 
ensure he wouldn’t go four years 
without an NCAA Tournament trip. 
Even then, he didn’t have the start-
ing job secured.

Before Racine closed the book on 

his career, he ended his legacy on a 
positive note. An early injury kept 
the starting spot in jeopardy, but 
Racine returned last December at 
the Great Lakes Invitational, which 
also turned out to be his coming-
out party. He started and won both 
games, totaling 62 saves with just 
three goals against.

From there, he only cemented 

his impact on the season: 46 saves 
against Penn State in January to 
exorcise the demons of the previous 

two years; 30 against Minnesota in 
the Big Ten Championship to seal 
Michigan’s 
NCAA 
Tournament 

ticket; 28 more to move onto the 
regional final. He was terrific again 
in that game, making 44 stops, 
but the Wolverines lost to a better 
North Dakota team that eventually 
won the national title.

Still, Racine made sure the 2013 

CCHA setback wasn’t the last we 
heard from him.

Breakout athlete of the year: 

Jehu Chesson, football

By a show of hands, who thought 

Chesson would have the season he 
did in 2015?

If your hand is up, you misun-

derstood that the previous question 
was rhetorical, and probably look 
like an idiot right now. Also, you’re 
lying.

Chesson’s season started slow, 

but he finished as strong as nearly 
any receiver in the Big Ten. As he 
developed chemistry with quar-
terback Jake Rudock, the redshirt 
junior receiver turned into one of 
the conference’s most dangerous 
deep ball threats, all while earning 
Jim Harbaugh’s respect as a blocker.

Over the final six games of the 

season, Chesson caught 33 passes 
for 574 yards and nine touchdowns 
— and that’s to say nothing of his 
96-yard kickoff return for a touch-

down against Northwestern in 
Week 6. The highlight, of course, 
was a 10-reception, 207-yard, four-
touchdown thriller against Indiana, 
including one touchdown catch 
through double coverage on a late 
fourth down to tie the game late. If 
Chesson hadn’t already been intro-
duced to the college football world 
before his big game in Blooming-
ton, it became nearly impossible to 
ignore him after it.

His season did end on a a lower 

note, with an apparent leg injury in 
the Citrus Bowl, but only after he 
tallied 118 yards and a touchdown 
against Florida.

Many things were said about 

Chesson last year, but the best quote 
had to be by his roommate, run-
ning back Drake Johnson. “Pardon 
my French, but Jehu’s got his s--- 
together,” Johnson said after the 
Citrus Bowl.

This past season, it was hard to 

argue with him.

Best 
Single-Event 
Perfor-

mance: Michigan defense vs. 
Northwestern, Oct. 10, 2016

Really, any of the Michigan foot-

ball team’s three straight shutouts 
— 31-0 against BYU on Sept. 26, 
28-0 at Maryland on Oct. 3 or 38-0 
against Northwestern on Oct. 10 —

would fit in this category.
The winner is the last of the 

three, against the best opponent 
in likely the biggest game. And as 
coach Jim Harbaugh put it after 
the game: “The fellas really came 
out ballin’ right from the start.”

He 
was 
right. 
Chesson 

returned the opening kickoff 96 
yards for a touchdown, but it was 
thanks to the defense that those 
points were the only ones the 
Wolverines needed, even if they 
did tack on 31 more. The defense 
forced a three-and-out on the 
ensuing possession and never 
let up, harassing the Wildcats all 
afternoon.

Northwestern managed just 13 

first downs and 38 rushing yards. 
It punted eight times, possessed 
the ball for less than 23 minutes 
and converted two third downs. 
Michigan had one interception — 
which Jourdan Lewis returned 
37 yards for a touchdown — four 
sacks and eight tackles for loss. 
Much like they had with their 
previous two opponents, the 
Wolverines beat the Wildcats 
into submission, forcing them to 
use three quarterbacks.

By the end of the game, North-

western was out of answers, 
and Michigan was rolling. As 
the crowd at Michigan Stadium 
begged for more even in the final 
minutes, chanting “DE-FENSE!” 
repeatedly, the game served as a 
highlight of the Wolverines’ sea-
son.

Game of the Year: Michigan 

72, No. 10 Indiana 69, March 11, 
2016

On the morning of March 11, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s NCAA Tournament hopes 
were on life support. Even after 
all of the chances the Wolverines 
had to lock up a return trip to 
the “Big Dance,” they still need-
ed one more win in the Big Ten 
Tournament quarterfinals.

That one more win had to come 

against Big Ten regular-season 
champion Indiana, which had 
run Michigan off its home court 
in the teams’ only prior meeting, 
22 hours after the Wolverines 
escaped with an overtime victo-
ry over No. 9 seed Northwestern.

And the game was in India-

napolis.

Still, Michigan scrapped and 

clawed, 
overcoming 
another 

poor shooting game and avoid-
ing runs like the 28-0 spurt that 
proved fatal in the first matchup. 
Duncan Robinson hit a 3-point-
er in the final minute to tie the 

game at 69, and an Indiana turn-
over on the next possession gave 
the Wolverines the final shot, 
the closest they had been to a 
marquee win in two months. 
They needed one more play — 
from point guard Derrick Wal-
ton, who ran the clock down near 
midcourt, 
or 

perhaps 
Zak 

Irvin, or even 
Robinson.

As it turned 

out, that play 
came 
from 
a 

most 
unlikely 

source. 
Wal-

ton drove right 
and passed the 
ball 
to 
Kam-

eron Chatman 
— thinking he was kicking it to 
Aubrey Dawkins — who hoisted 
a desperate 3-point try and bur-
ied it.

The Michigan bench, right 

behind Chatman as he shot, 
mobbed him immediately. The 
Wolverines all knew that shot 
likely 
made 
the 
difference 

between them making and miss-
ing the NCAA Tournament. As it 
turned out, they were right. They 
made the field as one of the last 
four teams in.

Freshman of the year: Kyle 

Connor, ice hockey

It’s hard to believe Connor 

was a freshman with the way he 
so thoroughly dominated NCAA 
hockey this season. His line 
with Tyler Motte and JT Com-
pher was regarded as one of the 
top in the nation, and with good 
reason. By season’s end, they all 
ranked in the top four nationally 
in points, and they formed one 
of the most feared combinations 
in the country come tournament 
time.

But it was Connor who stole 

the show. His 71 points were 
eight more than anyone else 
in the country, and his near-
est challenger was his linemate, 
Compher. The freshman sensa-
tion also led the country with 
35 goals and was tied for third 
nationally with 36 assists.

Among his many highlights 

were a pair of memorable games 
in the Big Ten Tournament. Con-
nor scored four goals in the semi-
finals before adding a one-goal, 
three-assist encore in the Cham-
pionship the next day, leaving 
a trail of exceptional plays and 
stunned goaltenders in his wake.

He seemed to be the odds-

on favorite for the Hobey Baker 
Award before Harvard senior 
Jimmy Vesey was announced as 

the somewhat surprising win-
ner. In any case, Connor’s season 
speaks for itself, with or without 
the Hobey.

Connor signed with the Win-

nipeg Jets this offseason, ending 
a short but superb college career.

Coach of the year: Mike Bot-

tom

Technically, 

this award is for 
Bottom’s work 
with the wom-
en’s swimming 
and 
diving 

team, but would 
anyone 
com-

plain if it were 
for the men’s 
team 
instead? 

By this point, 

Bottom has a case for this award 
every year. 

He rounded out his fourth 

season coaching the women’s 
team by leading the Wolverines 
to their first Big Ten title in 12 
years — and doing in front of the 
Canham Natatorium crowd, to 
boot.

The championship meet was 

a fitting breakthrough, with a 
contributions coming from stars 
new and old to claim the title. 
Ali DeLoof, who was a fresh-
man in Bottom’s first season, 
fought through an illness that 

week to finish second in the 100-
yard backstroke and anchor the 
400-meter freestyle relay, while 
freshman Siobhan Haughey was 
named Swimmer of the Champi-
onships. 

Bottom has improved the 

women’s Big Ten finish each 
successive year he has coached 
them, and while there’s no way 
to improve upon first place, it’s 
hard to bet against the renowned 
sprint coach to 
hold the Wol-
verines 
steady 

at the top of the 
conference for 
the foreseeable 
future.

Female Ath-

lete 
of 
the 

Year: 
Cindy 

Ofili, women’s 
track

Multiple 

members on any one of Michi-
gan’s four Big Ten champion 
women’s teams — women’s track 
and 
field, 
softball, 
women’s 

swimming and women’s tennis — 
could make a case here. But Ofili 
has had a year that tops them all, 
culminating with a trip to the 
Olympics.

Last month, Ofili won her sec-

ond straight silver medal in the 
100-meter hurdles at the Brit-

ish 
Athletics 
Championships. 

This one qualified her for next 
month’s Rio Games, where she’ll 
compete alongside her older sis-
ter, Tiffany Porter, who beat Ofili 
by two hundredths of a second.

Ofili has plenty to call her own 

in Ann Arbor. After spending 
most of her career rivaling her 
sister, who also had an illustri-
ous career at Michigan, this was 
the year Ofili broke through. On 

March 12, at the 
NCAA 
Indoor 

Championships, 
she 
won 
the 

national title in 
the 
60-meter 

hurdles 
after 

failing to qualify 
for the finals in 
2015. It was her 
first crown, and 
her time, tied for 
the sixth-fastest 

in NCAA history, broke the last 
program record her sister had.

Competing in the 100-meter 

hurdles at the Outdoor Champi-
onships, she finished fourth, still 
good enough for her fifth All-
American honor. Combined with 
the indoor title, she had the best 
season of her career in the two 
events.

And for the last three years of 

her career, she slowly picked off 

Chatman’s last-

second shot 
gave his team 
the victory.

Ofili will 
compete at 

this summer’s 
Olympics in Rio.

school records, two each year 

until almost most of the sprinting 
marks were hers: indoor 60-meter 
dash, indoor 200-meter dash, 
indoor 60-meter hurdles, outdoor 
100-meter dash, outdoor 100-
meter hurdles and 4x400-meter 
relay (along with her team).

Male athlete of the year: 

Mason Ferlic, track and field, 
cross country

Ferlic might not be the most 

recognizable name in Michigan 
sports, but how do you pick against 
the NCAA Champion in the Stee-
ple Chase?

The man they call Big Bird made 

up for his fall in the 2015 NCAA 
Track and Field 
Championships 
by winning the 
3,000-meter 
Steeple Chase in 
2016. He topped 
off a dominant 
career as a Wol-
verine, 
which 

has 
seen 
him 

take home UST-
FCCCA 
All-

America honors 
five times and win five Big Ten 
Championships to match. And 
that’s only on the track.

In cross-country season, Ferlic 

also won the Great Lakes Regional 
10,000-meter run and helped the 
Wolverines to win the Big Ten title 
for the first time since 1998. In the 
end, Ferlic’s NCAA title this sea-
son was enough to edge Connor for 
male athlete of the year honors.

Team of the year: Softball
It seems strange to give the 

softball team this award in a year 
that Carol Hutchins’ team actually 
underperformed from its previous 
season. But when you make the 
Women’s College World Series an 
annual destination, as the Wolver-
ines have in recent years, you get 
the benefit of the doubt.

For most of the season, Michi-

gan jockeyed with Florida for 
national supremacy. The Gators 
had knocked off the Wolverines 
in the World Series Final one year 
ago, and they seemed destined for 
a rematch in Oklahoma City.

But when Georgia upset Florida 

in the Super Regionals, Michigan 
looked poised to make a serious 
run at a title that has eluded them 
in their dominant Romero Era. 
Instead, a pair of early losses sent 
Wolverines to an early exit, and 
Oklahoma’s Sydney Romero — 
Sierra’s younger sister — captured 
the title in the year Sierra was 
National Player of the Year.

With stars like Romero, Sierra 

Lawrence and Sara Driesenga on 
their way out, the program could 
be looking at a regression in 2017. 
But with Hutchins at the helm, 
Michigan is a threat year in and 
year out to leave Oklahoma City as 
champion.

They’ll have to settle for a 

Schefter in the meantime.

Career Achievement Award: 

Sierra Romero, softball

This award isn’t ambiguous. 

Almost half of Michigan’s women’s 
sports teams have won Big Ten 
titles in the past four years, but only 
two have won all four, and Romero 
has accomplished the most.

From moment she arrived on 

campus, she has started all 253 

games. 
Once, 

during 
the 

NCAA 
Tour-

nament in her 
sophomore 
year, 
she 
was 

severely ill and 
needed IV fluids 
beforehand, and 
she still helped 
Michigan upset 
Arizona 
State 

twice to move 

onto the Super Regional.

She broke records every year: 

single-season home runs (23) as a 
freshman; batting average (.491) 
and runs (74) as a sophomore; 
RBI (83) as a junior; and a series 
of career marks as a senior until 
she had almost all of them. In each 
year she was consistent, in each 
year she seemed to play a different 
role for the team and yet in each 
year she was equally valuable.

Romero swept the national play-

er of the year awards as a senior 
and earned All-American honors 
in each of her four seasons at two 
different positions, moving to sec-
ond base early in her junior year. 
She leaves as the NCAA career 
record holder in runs and grand 
slams, and she is the only player 
ever to amass 300 runs, 300 hits 
and 300 RBI.

More 
significantly, 
Romero 

served as the face of the program, 
starting almost right when she 
began her career. She sparked the 
Wolverines when they were play-
ing well, and carried them when 
they weren’t. “She has more swag 
than anybody on the planet,” coach 
Carol Hutchins said of Romero this 
year.

Hutchins has spoken as highly 

of Romero as any other player 
in recent memory, and in one of 
Michigan’s most successful pro-
grams, it says a lot that Romero 
will go down as likely the greatest 
player in school history.

M Den provides preview of Nike gear

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Pay a visit to the M Den web-

site and you’ll be greeted with a 
countdown clock to Aug. 1, the 
first day Michigan’s apparel con-
tract with Nike begins.

Pay a visit to the M Den ware-

house and you’ll find that most 
Adidas products have already 
been moved to make room for the 
scores of boxes containing the 
newest Nike gear.

Out with the old and in with 

the new, as they say.

Wednesday, the M Den hosted 

several members of the media 
to discuss the store’s upcoming 
release of Mich-
igan-themed 
Nike apparel as 
well as provide a 
preview of vari-
ous products.

The M Den 

has been plan-
ning its launch 
of the new gear 
for over a year 
now, according 
to Scott Hirth, 
the co-owner of M Den.

It will begin a week-long prod-

uct release next week, starting 
with an extravagant midnight 
release on July 31.

According to Hirth, State 

Street will be blocked off between 
Williams and 
Liberty 
from 

10 p.m. to 2 
a.m. to accom-
modate 
the 

large amount 
of consumers 
that 
is 
cur-

rently 
antici-

pated. 
There 

will be a roll-
out party that 
will include 60 
members of the Michigan march-
ing band, members of the dance 
team, special guest appearances 
and a DJ.

Most of the 

fall 
line 
of 

products 
will 

be unveiled at 
the 
midnight 

release 
with 

the exception 
of the football 
jerseys. Michi-
gan’s 
agree-

ment 
with 

Nike includes 
a 
stipulation 

that calls for the football and 
both men’s and women’s bas-
ketball teams to be outfitted by 
Jordan Brand, a division of Nike 
characterized by the famous 

Jumpman icon in place of the 
Nike Swoosh.

Instead, 
the 

football jerseys 
will be unveiled 
separately 
on 

Aug. 2 at the M 
Den located on 
State Street in a 
ceremony open 
only by invita-
tion. In addition 
to the reveal of 
the football jer-
sey, the Aug. 2 

event will also present the new 
Michigan-themed shoe designed 
by Jordan Brand, dubbed the Air 
Jordan Trainer 1.

The jerseys and Air Jordan 

Trainer 1 will then be made avail-
able to the public on Aug. 6. The 
jersey will be available at all M 
Den locations while the shoe 
will be available at just the State 
Street location and on the M Den 
website — which, according to 
Hirth, has been recently beefed 
up to deal with the flood of visi-
tors expected during the launch 
week.

Hirth 
believes 
that, 
even 

though a large order was placed, 
the shoe will be one of their 
quickest selling items and will 
most likely sell out in a brief peri-
od of time.

Romero was 

national player 
of the year as a 

senior.

Starting Aug. 1, the M Den will have a week-long release of new Michigan-themed Nike products — including the shirt above.

The M Den will 
host a midnight 

release event 

July 31.

Michigan’s 

apparel contract 
with Nike will 
begin Aug. 1.
