University President Mary Sue Coleman (right) and Vice President for Student Affairs E. Royster Harper hold a fireside chat with students in the Kuenzel Room of the

At fireside chat, Coleman fields
questions on campus diversity

Wide-ranging event
also covers vampire
novels, top eateries
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Speaking before an intimate
group of students gathered in
front of a crackling fire in the Kue-
nzel Room of the Michigan Union
yesterday, University President

Mary Sue Coleman answered a
variety of questions that ranged
from serious matters like diversi-
ty at the University to more light-
hearted topics like the book she
recently read about vampires.
Coleman's first monthly fire-
side chat of the year drew approx-
imately 40 students who pitched
questions to Coleman and E.
Royster Harper, the University's
vice president of student affairs.
Among the topics discussed at
yesterday's gathering was diver-

sity on campus - an issue that
multiple students asked Coleman
about.
Questioned about the Univer-
sity's commitment to diversity,
Coleman said it is an overarch-
ing commitment of which she is
extremely proud.
"I think if there's one thing that
defines the University of Michi-
gan, at least in higher education
and the people who go to the Uni-
versity of Michigan, they say this
is a University that puts its money

where its mouth was,"' Coleman
said. "We were willing to go all
the way to the Supreme Court,
and I'm very proud of that."
In fact, Coleman said the Uni-
versity's commitment to diversity
is one of the reasons she decided
to take the job as the University's
president.
"One of the reasons that I was
attracted to come to Michigan in
the first place was because of the
commitment of the institution (to

PUS BAR SCENE
Ann Arbor bar owners report no
major fallout from smoking ban

Some watering
holes see increased
family business
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
More than six months after
Michigan's statewide smoking
ban took effect, owners of local
restaurants and bars say more
families have been eating at their
establishments.
While some owners worried
that the smoking ban - which

took effect May 1, 2010 - would
decrease the number of customers
who frequented their establish-
ments, local restaurant owners
and managers told The Michigan
Daily that their businesses have
actually picked up.
Jim Higgins, day manager of
Ashley's pub on State Street, said
foot traffic has increased and that
more parents are taking their chil-
dren to the pub for meals.
"People aren't afraid of the
smoke anymore," he said.
Though Ashley's has seen a
spike in family business, other
businesses have seen no differ-

ences in clientele.
Ed Evers, manager at Score-
keepers Sports Grill and Pub
Maynard Street, said he has
seen neither an increase nor a
decrease in business because of
the ban.
"(The ban) hasn't really affect-
ed us too much," Evers said.
"Everybody's taken to the law
well."
Evers added he was not a fan
of the ban at first, but he now
thinks it's beneficial.
"The smell of bars has gotten
better," Evers said. "It's nice to

By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
In a press conference at the
Ford School of Public Policy today,

Michigangovernor-elect Rick Sny-
der announced the appointment of
former lieutenant governor Dick
Posthumus as senior advisor and
current Democratic House Speak-
er Andy Dillon - a former Demo-

working in Lansing. During his
campaign, Snyder branded himself
as an outsider with the business

GETTING PSYCHED

'U' plaque on moon

While the legend that a University
of Michigan flag stands proudly on the
moon isn't true, there is truth to a relat-
ed myth that claims a chapter of the
University of Michigan Alumni Associa-
tion was founded during the lunar land-
ing in 1971.
As the legend goes, the team of astro-
nauts on the Apollo 15 journey took a
charter for a University Alumni Asso-
ciation branch with them into space to
officially form an alumni association on
the moon. The legend is, in fact, true.
The three former University students
- astronauts Colonel David Scott, Major
Alfred Worden and Colonel James
Irwin - who piloted Apollo 15 did leave
behind a document that established a
charter of the University of Michigan
Alumni Association on the moon.
The charter makes the University the
first and only school to have an alumni
association chapter on the moon.
The only evidence of the charter is a
document, etched into a 45-word plaque

that was left behind on the lunar sur-
face.
"The Alumni Association of The Uni-
versity of Michigan. Charter Number
One," the charter reads. "This isto certi-
fy that The University of Michigan Club
of The Moon is a duly constituted unit
of the Alumni Association and entitled
to all the rights and privileges under the
Association's Constitution."
With those words, the University's
Alumni Association on the moon was
founded. It's a history that the Alumni
Association continues to boast, high-
lighting the fact on its website.
And while the moon may be the most
unusual branch of the Alumni Associa-
tion, it's far from the only chapter. With
more than 460,000 University alumni
living across the globe, the University's
Alumni Association has established
chapters in 31 countries and has numer-
ous chapters throughout the United
States.

Bush legacy focus of new memoir

Bush is back, and
eager to help history
judge him
WASHINGTON (AP) - George
W. Bush knows that history will
shape his legacy more than any-
thing he can say. But that's not
gonna stop a guy from trying.
After two years of near silence,
Bush is back.
With his new memoir, "Deci-
sion Points," and a promotion tour,
the president who in cockier times
could not think of a single mis-
take he had made, lists many. He
counts the years without a post-
9/11 attack as his transcendent
achievement. He says the eco-
nomic calamity he handed off to
Barack Obama was "one ugly way
to end a presidency."

While he's been absent from the
national scene, Bush's team has
been busy. Some of the mostpolar-
izing figures from his 2001-2009
presidency have found second
lives in the political world.
Karl Rove, the operative who
might as well have put "mas-
termind" on his business card,
became a master money-raiser for
the midterm elections in plenty of
time to make Democrats apoplec-
tic all over again. Dick Cheney,
the Bush vice president whose
influence rivaled if not surpassed
Rove's, has tormented the Obama
administration at many turns.
Not Bush.
He has given the occasional
innocuous speech, has tended his
presidential center, has helped
with Haiti earthquake relief and
has offered glimpses of a life that
has him walking Barney the dog

in his Dallas neighborhood with a
poop bag, "picking up that which
I had been dodging for the past
eight years."
"Decision Points" puts Bush
back in the public eye. He'll be all
over TV this week and beyond,
from news and opinion shows to
Oprah Winfrey and Jay Leno.
But times have changed.
Hard-driving tea party adher-
ents, a post-Bush movement,
helped to power a Republican
takeover of the House and gains
in the Senate in the recent elec-
tions, seemingly light years from
the "compassionate conservatism"
that Bush said he hoped to bring
to the White House from Texas a
decade ago.
For all the sour struggles of his
time in Washington and the divi-
siveness over war policy, Bush
pushed Congress to spend billions

more on education and ushered
in prescription drug coverage for
seniors in a major expansion of
health care, now overshadowed
by Obama's overhaul. Those mea-
sures, too, are out of step with the
Republican majority coming in.
And he's not out to trash Obama
in his new book. The Democrat, in
his 2008 presidential campaign,
spared no effort to criticize Bush
for taking the U.S. to war in Iraq,
for letting the effort in Afghani-
stan flag and for presiding over an
economy sinking into the Great
Recession.
Bush turns the other cheek,
merely praising Obama's decision
to add troops in Afghanistan.
Instead he details difficult
times with Cheney, still his friend,
delivering some of the buzz-
generating palace intrigue that is
expected of any political memoir.

Obama boosts India
for 'rightful place
in world'
NEW DELHI (AP) - Deepen-
ing America's stake in Asian power
politics, President Barack Obama
on yesterday endorsed India's bid
to become a permanent member
of the U.N. Security Council, hop-
ing to elevate the nation of a bil-
lion people to "its rightful place in
the world" alongside an assertive
China.
Obama's declaration, delivered
to the pounding applause of India's
parliament members, spoke to a
mission broader than the makeup
of one global institution. By spend-
ing three packed days in India,
announcing trade deals, dismiss-
ing job-outsourcing gripes and
admonishing India's rival Paki-
stan, Obama went all in for an ally
whose support he hopes to bank on
for years.
"I want every Indian citizen to
know: The United States of Amer-
ica will not simply be cheering
you on from the sidelines," Obama
said inside the soaring legislative
chamber of the capital city. "We
will be right there with you, shoul-
der to shoulder, because we believe
in the promise of India."
To Obama, that promise entails
shaking up the world order by giv-
ing more voice to developing coun-
tries that offer lucrative markets
for U.S. products and potential
help to counter terrorism and a

warmingplanet. Indiafits Obama's
agenda perfectly because it is the
world's largest democracy and sits
in the heart of a pivotal, vexing
region.
The diplomacy in India also
gave Obama a chance to reassert
himself on the global stage, far
from Washington in the aftermath
after humbling congressional elec-
tions.
His final day in India began
with a lavish welcome ceremony
at the majestic palace residence of
India's president and ended there
as Obama and his wife, Michelle,
were toasted to a state dinner.
The capstone of Obama's
outreach here came when he
announced support for India's long
push to achieve a permanent place
on the Security Council, the elite
body responsible for maintain-
ing international peace. It under-
lined Obama's contention that the
partnership between the U.S. and
India could have defining impact
on both countries and the world.
"The just and sustainable inter-
national order that America seeks
includes a United Nations that
is efficient, effective, credible
and legitimate," Obama said as
he called for India to be part of a
reformed council.
Yet White House aides acknowl-
edge any changes to the council
could be messy and years in the
making. Attempts to expand the
council have long failed because of
rivalries between countries.
India considered Obama's move
to be an enormous coup regardless.

DETROIT
New Jeep Grand
Cherokee helps
Chrysler rebound
A year-and-half ago, Chrysler
almost went under. Now, a new ver-
sion of the Jeep Grand Cherokee is
helping turn its fortunes around by
narrowing its third-quarter loss and
raising its confidence as it rolls out
an unprecedented 10 new models
before the end of this year.
Chrysler was weighed down by
debt, billions in losses and a poor
reputation for quality when it filed
for government-funded bankruptcy
in April 2009. The company almost
didn't get government help to see
it through bankruptcy court. But
it emerged from Chapter 11 with
a tough new management and an
aggressive plan to remake its cars
and trucks.
Even though the company is still
losing money and must improve its
quality ratings, the push for goo
vehicles is payingoff.
DENVER, Colorado
Cocaine bust linked
to Mexican cartel
Gang members, a retired Den-
ver firefighter and a college team
coach were among 35 people
accused of transporting more than
40 pounds of cocaine from Mexico
to the Denver area every week, fed-
eral officials said Monday.
Officials said the drug ring's
source was the Sinaloa cartel,
which is in a bloody turf war with
the Juarez cartel in Ciudad Juarez,
a northern Mexican border city. At
least 20 people died in drug-gang
violence over the weekend there.
Despite the international sup-
plier, authorities described the
operation as "homegrown," with
all 35 defendants involved in dis-
tributing cocaine in the Denver
area. They said cocaine was trans-
ported in secret panels in vehicles
that traveled into Colorado on
Interstate 25.
KABUL, Afghanistan
Canadian troops to
remain overseas to
train Afghan troops
Canada's government has agreed
to keep 750 military trainers in
Afghanistan until 2014, a pledge
of support which may help plug a
critical shortage of 900 trainers for
NATO's year-old mission to bolster
Afghan security forces.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai
wants his nation's police and army
to take the lead in protecting and
defending their homeland by 2014
- a deadline that will be reached
only if the stepped-up training
effort continues with support from
foreign capitals weary of the war.
U.S. Lt. Gen. William Caldwell,
the commander of NATO's train-
ing mission, said Monday that the
NATO mission faced a shortage of
900 trainers.
Hours later, a senior Canadian
government official said that 750
military trainers and about 200
support troops will remain and

most likely be based in Kabul after
Canada's combat mission ends
in 2011. It was unclear whether
the offer was a direct response to
Caldwell's request.
"If that's what NATO is looking at
and that's the block that we're look-
ing at it may bridge the gap," the
official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity because no authoriza-
tion was given to speak publicly.
BAGHDAD, Iraq
Car bombs hit three
Iraqi cities, kill 21
Car bombs struck three Shiite
cities in southern Iraq on Monday,
killing more than 20 people in an
apparent move to derail progress
toward forming a new government
as political leaders tried to break
the eight-month deadlock.
The blasts in the holy cities of
Karbala and Najaf and in Iraq's sec-
ond largest city of Basra were the
third major attacks since last week,
after the slaughter of more than 50
Christians in a Baghdad church and
a string of 13 coordinated bombings
across Baghdad that killed more
than 90 people.
There was no claim of responsi-
bility for Monday's attacks, but the
violence underscores the desire of
al-Qaida and other Sunni extrem-
ists to foment sectarian division at
a time when Iraqis are watching
to see if their leaders can form a
new government accepted by both
the Shiite majority and the Sunni
minority.

State Dept. calls
decision to build
counterproductive'
JERUSALEM (AP) - The
Israeli government is moving
ahead with plans to build nearly
1,300 apartments in disputed
east Jerusalem, an official said
Monday, drawing a harsh U.S.
response just as Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is there for
meetings with American leaders.
The plan drew renewed atten-
tion to Israeli settlement policies
just as Washington was pressing
Israel to curb construction in a
bid to get stalled peace talks back
on track.
Israel's Interior Ministry said
the decision to seek public com-
ment on the building plans was
merely a procedural step.
Even so, the announcement
risked setting off another Israeli
run-in with Vice President Joe
Biden, who met with Netanyahu
in New Orleans on Sunday. Israel
infuriated Biden early this year
by announcing other construction
plans in east Jerusalem while the
vice president was visiting.
In Washington, State Depart-
ment spokesman P.J. Crowley
said Monday's announcement

was "deeply disappointing" and
"counterproductive to our efforts
to resume direct negotiations
between the parties."
Netanyahuis office did not com-
ment.
The U.S., along with the rest
of the international community,
opposes Israeli settlement con-
struction in the West Bank and
east Jerusalem - captured terri-
tories claimed by the Palestinians.
Washington is already frus-
trated over Netanyahu's refusal
to renew curbs on settlement con-
struction in the West Bank that
expired in September. The Pales-
tinians say they will walk away
from peace talks, relaunched just
two months ago, if the building
restrictions aren't renewed.
Netanyahu's talks with Biden,
and later this week with Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,
are aimed at finding a compro-
mise to restart the talks. Clinton
has said that the settlements are
a secondary issue that would be
solved automatically if the two
sides agree on borders.
. News of the new building
plans came from Israel's Interior
Ministry, which is controlled by
the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas
Party, and it was not known
whether Netanyahu was told
about it ahead of time.

Interior Ministry official
Efrat Orbach said the plans to
build 978 apartments in the Har
Homa neighborhood and 320 in
the neighborhood of Ramot were
approved six months ago but that
for unspecified "technical rea-
sons" the ministry only recently
published the plans to give the
public an opportunity to appeal.
She denied the timing of the
move had anything to do with
Netanyahu's U.S. trip and said it
would take years before building
actually starts.
The anti-settlement Israeli
group Peace Now denounced the
move as a "huge provocation by
Netanyahuoat avery sensitivetime
in the negotiation process." It said
in a statement that "it is going to
take a few years until the bulldoz-
ers can start the construction."
Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said regardless of when
the building actually takes place,
the latest Israeli move was a sign
of bad faith.
He said the Palestinians had
hoped Netanyahu had gone to the
U.S. "to make a choice for peace
and not settlements."
"Unfortunately, once again,
when given the choice, he chooses
settlements," Erekat said. "We
hold him fully responsible for the
collapse of these negotiations."

Trial begins for Smart kidnapper

Kidnapping victim
Smart testifies
before jurors
SALT LAKE CITY - Elizabeth
Smart remembers not being able
to make out the threat, only the
feel of cold knife at her neck.
As the then-14-year-old lay
in bed alongside her baby sister,
the man repeated: "Don't make
a sound. Get out of bed and come
with me, or I will kill you and your
family." She was his hostage, he
told her.
"I was shocked. I thought I was
having a nightmare. It was just
indescribable fear," Smart, now
23, told jurors Monday on the first
day of testimony in the federal
trial of Brian David Mitchell, the
man accused of kidnapping her in
June 2002.
That night, they fled up the hills

above her home, with Smart in her
red pajamas and tennis shoes, and
the knife to her back.
Her younger sister - a baby
blanket wrapped around her head
and neck - rushed to their moth-
er, telling of the kidnapping.
"It was utter terror," their
mother, Lois Smart, testified earli-
er Monday. "It was the worst feel-
ing, knowing that I didn't know
where my child was. I was help-
less."
Nine months later, motorists
spotted Elizabeth Smart walking
in a Salt Lake City suburb with
Mitchell.
His attorneys did not dispute
the facts of the abduction. But
during opening statements, they
said the prosecution's allegation
that he was a calculating person
who planned the kidnapping was
wrong.
Known as a homeless street
preacher named "Immanuel,"

Mitchell was influenced by a
worsening mental illness and reli-
gious beliefs that made him think
he was doing what God wanted,
his attorneys said.
Mitchell, who has a long gray-
ing beard to the middle of his
chest and hair to the middle of his
back, was again removed from the
courtroom Monday for singing
hymns,eso he's watching and lis-
tening from a holdingcell.
Smart's mother testified that
she and her children ran into
Mitchell downtown and that she
offered him ajob doinghandyman
work at the family's home. One of
her sons encouraged her to give
him money, she said.
"He looked like a clean-cut,
well-kept man that was down on
his luck," she said. "I gave him $5."
Later, the family hired Mitchell
to help fix a leaky roof, Lois Smart
said. It was the only job he did for
the family.

research and politics, according to
Forrest, the University has been
involved in alternative energy
research for decades.
"We were the first University in
the United States to have a formal
nuclear reactor," Forrest said, cit-
ing the Ford Nuclear Reactor facil-
ity that began operating in 1957.
Forrest stressed the importance
of University researchers partner-
ing with industry leaders, adding
that the North Campus Research
Complex - a 28-building complex
formerly owned by Pfizer Inc. - is
a great starting point.
"The North Campus Research
Complex is a place where we can
do this combination of research,
where we bring University teams
together and industry and govern-
ment partners," Forrest said.
Stabenow is one of the govern-
ment officials who is actively mak-
ing an effort to establish alternative
energy in the state, Forrest said.
At the event, Stabenow said
Michigan has the tools to take
advantage of the green revolution,
given the state's ties with the auto-
mobile industry.
"We have some of the very best
engineers in the world in Michi-
gan, supported by our wonderful
universities," Stabenowsaid.
Stabenow said she believes that
new alternative energy technology
will generate new jobs and indus-
fries in the state and will s&ccess-

fully boost Michigan's economy.
"There are 8,000 parts in a wind
turbine," Stabenow said. "We can
manufacture every one of those
parts here in Michigan."
Stabenow also emphasized the
importance of producing this tech.
nology domestically.
"Creating this wonderful new
technology is important, but it's
also important where it's made,"
Stabenow said. "If (this greenrevo-
lution) happens in America, as it
should, we will benefit in Michi-
gan."
Grewe said his company, Gener-
al Motors, has realized the impor-
tance of getting ahead in the global
market when it comes to alterna-
tive energy. Its newest electric
vehicle - the Chevy Volt - will be
revolutionary in the realm of elec-
tric cars, he added.
"This is really true. You are liv-
ing a reality, everything Senator
Stabenow said, you are about to see
how it was brought to Michigan,"
Grewe said.
Grewe said there has been spec-
ulation surrounding the efficiency
of electric cars, noting that owners
who forget to plug in their elec-
tric automobile will need to wait
four hours until it is completely
charged. With the Volt, Grewe said,
owners won't have to wait due to
the car's new on-board generator
technology.
"You have 40 or 50 miles of elec-
tric and after that, you don't have
to wait for it to recharge," he said.
"You aren't held hostage by elec-
tricity." r

Grewe added that because elec-
tricity is less expensive than gaso-
line, owners of electric cars will
end up paying the equivalent of
only 2 to 3 cents per mile.
Echoing Stabenow's sentiments
concerning domestic manufactur-
ing, Grewe said the Volt epitomizes
Michigan's ability to sustain its
automobile industry and embrace
new technology.
"It took so many diverse tech-
nologies and diverse trades to make
this car happen," he said. "Very few
companies can do it. Michigan can
do it."
Grewe, who brought with him
three models of the Volt, said in an
interview after the event that feed-
back surrounding the car has been
overwhelmingly positive. In line
with Grewe's statement, audience
members raced outside to see the
cars after the presentation.
Business School sophomore
Simon Qin, who attended the sym-
posium, said he was extremely
impressed by the Chevy Volt, add-
ing that he believes it may be one
catalyst in improving Michigan's
economy.
"There really aren't any compet-
itors," Qin said. "Plus, this car looks
better than anything that comes
close, hands down."
At the end of his presentation,
Grewe hinted that the Volt is just
the beginning of the auto industry
taking advantage of alternative
energy technology.
"I can't even tell you what we're
doing next," Grewe said. "It's going

A loco beverage ban
MLCC needs to rethink the removal of Four Loko
ecently, a rising number of teens and young adults
appear to be going loco for Four Loko. But a recent ban
on the alcoholic energy drink in Michigan will interrupt
the craze for this controversial drink. A Michigan Liquor Con-
trol Commission order, signed on Thursday, prohibits the sale of
55 types of alcoholic energy drinks in the state, including Four
Loko. With two of the commission's five members absent, the
ban passed 2-1. While the drinks may prove to be dangerous, the
MLCC's decision skipped procedural steps necessary to imple-
ment a statewide ban. The MLCC should reevaluate its reaction-
ary ban of Four Loko and other alcoholic energy beverages.

Together, we can be Superman


Four Loko - a 23.5-ounce drink that
contains approximately four beers worth
of alcohol and as much caffeine as 12
ounces of coffee - stirred much contro-
versy in Michigan after the hospitaliza-
tion of students who drank the product
and the reported rape of a 14-year-old girl
who drank Four Loko mixed with rum,
as reported last week by the Detroit Free
Press. The University of Rhode Island,
Ramapo College in New Jersey and several
other schools have reacted to incidents
surrounding the drink and banned alcohol
energy drinks on their campuses. Michi-
gan is the first and only state to prohibit
the drink statewide. The order requests
that the caffeinated alcoholic drinks be
removed from shelves within 30 days.
The MLCC ban was a knee-jerk reaction
to recent frenzy, rather than a careful con-
sideration based upon empirical evidence.
The MLCC couldn't possibly have had
time to consider the data and discuss con-
cerns - the FDA hasn't even completed its
study of Four Loko and its health effects.
Without clear, empirical reasoning for the
order, the MLCC shouldn't have passed
the ban.
And MLCC seemed to sidestep proce-
dure to implement a ban. Two out of the
five members of the commission were
absent from the meeting at which the ban

was passed. It's unreasonable to enact a
statewide ban without full attendance of
the small commission. All members of
the MLCC should be present when mak-
ing important decisions, especially when
those decisions affect the entire state.
The MLCC also failed to communicate
with these businesses and the company
responsible for the sale of Four Loko, Phu-
sion Projects, LLC. Phusion Projects was
never given a notice of the commission's
proposal and never had a chance to make
it's side of the story heard. The MLCC
also failed to consider the effects of the
ban on companies that produce alcoholic
energy beverages, as well as the businesses
in Michigan that profit from distributing
these drinks.
Without time to consider the imprac-
ticalities of the ban, the prohibition is a
naive response to the drinks' safety con-
cerns, rather than a comprehensive plan
to prevent further harm. The MLCC hast-
ily skipped over reasonable alternatives
worth trying, like the use of educational
campaigns or the relabeling of the prod-
ucts to emphasize possible dangers.
The MLCC was too rash in its decision
- even hastier than Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil's porch couch ban. The MLCC should
revoke or reconsider its decision to ban
alcoholic energy drinks.

he Michigan Theatre's screen-
ing of "Waiting for Super-
man" on Wednesday night
struck a chord with
everyone packed
in the theatre that
night. The film cre-
ated a symphony
of sniffles as the
credits rolled. The
audience watched
the flip side of luck
bring tears to the
eyes of four out of LIBBY
the five children ASHTON
we met that night.
My heart broke as
I was confronted
with the inequalities plaguing Amer-
ican children.
The world I knew as a child is
inextricably linked to the person I
am today. I am a product of a public
school and I am one of the lucky few
who lived in a district that made our
public school a top priority. I attri-
bute my optimism about the world
and my belief that I can make a dif-
ference to my educational experience
during my formative years.
In the world that incubated me for
12 years, I felt loved and empowered.
My early education teachers were
genuinely invested in not only my
academic success, but also my emo-
tional well-being. I felt like I mat-
tered to the community that greeted
me every morning and waved good-
bye every afternoon.
As I grew up, my relationships
with faculty members, the admin-
istration and community members
developed, too. My voice as a student
carried weight among the adults in
my world. I felt encouraged to chal-
lenge ideas and push boundaries. In
my first year of high school, I had an
English teacher whose expectations

of excellence terrified all of my class-
mates and me into working harder
than we thought we ever could. She
inspired us to pursue our intellectual
potential and gave little - if any -
care to the mandated curriculum and
standardized tests. She treated us as
though we might all become Pulitzer
Prize-winning writers.
Among my peers, it was cool to
be smart. I can distinctly remember
feeling socially influenced to work
harder because the people who did
were more impressive than the peo-
ple who didn't. Those who ostracized
themselves from school ostracized
themselves from the social world to
which the school was so intimately
connected.
And here I sit in Ann Arbor, able to
write about the power residing with
our generation simply because I have
had the privilege of experiencing a
system that worked for me rather than
against me. I fervently believe that I
can make a difference in this world
because my experiences thus far have
shown me so. But this belief in myself
is a privilege of which I am not the
slightest bit more deserving than the
children whose names weren't called
during the lotteries documented in
"Waiting for Superman."
My heart broke on Wednesday
night as I was confronted with stories
to which too many children around
the country can relate. Too many
children spend the first part of their
lives in a world that leaves them feel-
ing hopeless and insignificant. Before
they're even old enough to realize
the gravity of the injustice to which
they've been subjected, these children
are robbed of the opportunity to feel
as if the world is theirs to seize. Their
ability to aim high and reach far is
restricted by an education system that
fails to nourish their essential human

need for self-actualization.
The members of the panel discus-
sion thatoccurred after the screening
- who were all experts on the status
of the American education system -
reacted to the movie, highlighting
the movie's flaws and expanding on
its messages. Most thought the blame
shouldn't be placed exclusively on
bad teachers, bad parents, bad princi-
pals, the teachers union, bad schools
and so on. Rather, we - as a society
that claims to care about justice and
equality of opportunity'- must col-
laboratively re-evaluate the nuances
of what's working and what isn't
within American public schools.
Re-evaluate the
nuances of broken
public education.
I was (and, to a large extent, still
am) blind totheinner-workings of the
flaws in the public education system.
I won't be able to contribute anything
of value to the prescribed societal
re-evaluation until I see the problem
first-hand and learn about the expe-
riences of the people its afflicting.
We should feel a sense of urgency to
see where, exactly, the problems lie
and what, exactly, we can do to solve
them. If so many American children
continue to spend their first 12 years
of school feelingbeaten down, unspo-
ken for and powerless, what kind of
contribution can they be expected to
make during their next 50 years?

The need for student regents


Last spring, University students overwhelm-
ingly voted to elect MForward candiates to
represent them on the Michigan Student
Assembly. All 19 MForward candidates up for
election won seats, led by current MSA Presi-
dent and MForward founder Chris Armstrong.
This landslide victory was a mandate from the
student body for MForward to pursue their
campaign promise of aggressive advocacy to
address major problems on campus.
Since taking office in April, MForward's slate
of diverse student leaders has become the new
leaders of the MSA. MSA's. current treasurer,
chief of staff and seven committee chairs were
all MForward candidates and have been at the
forefront of many major initiatives. We have
met with the Ann Arbor Police Department to
address noise and trash violations on Football
Saturdays, worked with administrators to offer
transportation options for student organizations
and delayed the vote on the porch couch ban due
to a lack of student involvement in the debate.
Currently, MForward party members on
MSA are leading the initiative to implement
an open housing policy on campus. For those
who are unfamiliar with open housng, it would
allow students living in University housing to
choose their roommates regardless of gender
identity and expression. Open housing isn't
simply about creating an inclusive and non-dis-
criminatory community. it's also about about
students' rights to make their own decisions.
ELAINE MORTON

MForward is proud to be leading the way on
such a monumental policy change and proud to
keep its promise to work for the students.
Our new slate of candidates for this Novem-
ber's election is as poised and energetic as the
last. With the election less than two weeks
away, our 15 candidates have already been out
on the Diag listening to concerns from the stu-
dents. MForward is sticking to its plan to listen
to the needs and desires of the students that
MSA represents.
We have established a group of candidates
consistent with our goal of bringing diverse
ideas and experiences to MSA by selecting
student leaders from a wide variety of campus
groups and communities. Our slate of candi-
dates includes leaders from the Chi Phi Fra-
ternity, College Democrats, Indian American
Student Association, Arab Student Associa-
tion and the NAACP, to name a few. Our slate
also includes current MSA representatives and
MSA committee members.
Keep a lookout for MForward candidates
around campus and be sure to let them know
what you'd like to see improved or changed at
the University. For more information on our
candidates and their platforms, check us out
on Facebook or at mforward.org. Most impor-
tantly, be sure to vote in MSA Elections on Nov.
17 and 18 at vote.umich.edu.
Brendan Friedman is the MForward Party Chair.

Sixteen years ago, Michigan voters rejected the chance
to hold a constitutional convention. On Nov. 2, 2010, the
outcome was the same. Many may have voted against the
measure because of the high expenses involved and the
ominous threat of another blow to the University's fund-
ing. And these reasons may hold some validity. ButI think
that the University of Michigan, other state universities
and community colleges missed an opportunity to come
together and have students' voices be heard.
This year, I ran for the University's Board of Regents
with the ambition of collecting 30,000 signatures in
three weeks. While a seemingly impossible goal, I tried
my best and successfully spread awareness for the need
to have a student's voice on the Board of Regents. While
the goal was never reached, the positive feedback was
encouraging. Someone told me that "having no student on
the board would be like Meijer having no customer ser-
vice. How would Meijer know if it was doing everything
right?" This person brought up a good point. How can the
Board of Regents truly know whether or not their deci-
sions are beneficial for students?
I'm not suggesting a student takeover of the Board of
Regents, three spots for students or the elimination of this
governing body, but rather one voting student regent. Just
one. Not just for the University, but for every public universi-
ty in Michigan. Imagine the University of Michigan, Michi-
gan State University, Wayne State University, Grand Valley
State University, Western Michigan University and many
other outstanding educational institutions in Michigan
having one student on their governing board. While these
officials are either elected or appointed by the governor, the
constitutional convention was our - the thousands of col-
lege students across Michigan - missed opportunity.
The most salient reason for a student board member is
the unique and refreshing perspective it brings to many
discussions. Currently, inadequate - but appreciated -
efforts are made to incorporate students' voices at board
meetings. There may be time for public comment and
sending a letter, but students must be engaged in mean-
ingful dialogue.
A student regent could give insights on issues that are
on the minds of the people the board serves. This student
would see first-hand the impact of a tuition increase or
implementation of a new policy and could submit ideas

that may not normally be discussed. The feedback given
during participation in a board discussion would improve
both the governance of the university and the institution
holistically.
This would also give student representatives priceless
leadership experience, something I wish could be grant-
ed to every student to better prepare a new generation of
leaders. Student representatives would learn communica- 4
tion skills and gain valuable leadership experience.
Student representatives would close avoid between the
students and administration. Welcoming a student on the
board would increase awareness about campus issues and
hopefully start new dialogue among students. Certainly,
these meetings are within public domain, but to the stu-
dents, there is such a disconnect that the meeting might
as well be held in the dark. Students deserve a meaningful 4
engagement with their university's governing body.
The University of California has a student regent. The
University of Texas has a non-voting student regent.
Michigan should be the first state in which each univer-
sity and community college has a student regent. Proposal
1 would have been our key to unlocking this opportunity.
With the exploration of our out-dated constitution, stu-
dents across the state could rally, send letters and petition
for an amendment to add student representation to elect-
ed university boards. This isn't possible now, but students
must continue to look forward.
Now is the time to start something that may be icono-
clastic, coming together as college campuses to fight for
representation. Students should create a ballot proposal
to be voted on by Michigan citizens that amends the state
constitution to read: "Every state-funded university and
community college will have one voting student repre-
sentative." While the process to select that student may
bring about new debate, the fundamental issue must be
resolute. The students' voice must be heard.
Let's call our newly elected representatives and lead-
ers, petition at every university and community college
and spread the word. Let's gather the necessary support
and signatures to place a proposition in an upcoming elec-
tion to amend the constitution for a change that can ben-
efit students and the state schools.

does not stray far behind. Though
he still clings to the minimal-
ist spaceship atmosphere that
he perfected in the first Man on
the Moon, this time around it is
undoubtedly darker and not near-
ly as chock full of sunny radio hits.
The first note of "These Wor-
ries" isn't a musical one, but rath-
er the swooshing sound of a joint
being inhaled. Not surprising con-
sidering Cudi's ongoing love affair
with weed (he even has a track
simply titled "Marijuana" that
clocks in at exactly 4:20, showing
true pothead dedication). "These
Worries" gets some much-needed
punch served up in the form of
Mary J. Blige's guest vocals. Cudi
describes his angst simply but
straightforwardly as Blige takes

it away: "These worries are heavy
/ They rest on my shoulders / My
pride it won't let me / Fall victim
no more."
Single "Erase Me" is Cudi's
attempt at some alt-rock/pop
crossover. With a cheesy '80s
drumbeat and chugging guitars
leading off the song, Cudi sounds
about as close to hip hop here as
Lil Wayne was on Rebirth. But
unlike Weezy's ill-fated attempt
at a rock album, "Erase Me" is
actually listenable. Though the
lyrics are forgettable ("I keep on
running, keep on running / and
nothing works/ I can't get away
from you"), Cudi strikes the per-
fect self-aware hipster chord with
Kanye West's trite guest verse and
a chorus that will take up residen-
cy in your brain for days.
All signs on Man on the Moon II
point to Kid Cudi's mental deteri-
oration. Kanye's young protig is

holding his own now, but he isn't
handling fame all that gracefully.
Yes, he has the requisite cocky
pretension of any Kanye disciple,
but lately Cudi's rep has been tar-
nished due to his recent arrest,
onstage tussles with fans and his
ongoing trend of showing up to his
performances drunk and totally
strung out.
On Man on the Moon II, Cudi
jumps from reveling in his fame
to chasing women to contemplat-
ing suicide to realizing that even
though he's trapped in his own
anguished mind, "Hey, it's not that
bad at all!" Cudi's emotional issues
(and weed) are the epicenter of
every song. Sure, "Mr. Rager"
and "GHOST!" are the two of
the best tracks Kid Cudi has ever
produced, but by the end of this
despondent hipster-hop album we
are leftworriedly wondering: Will
this guy just get a shrink already?

sic martyr potential of Kanye's
808s and Heartbreak to be a one-
off outlet of emotional despair as
Cudi lamented his father's death,
his obsession with pot and his
plaguing nightmares. After the
popularity of his debut, you'd
think Cudi would buck up a lit-
tle, revel in his success and then
continue to churn out sub-par
pop anthems about getting high
to maintain his newfound ghet-
to-fabulous lifestyle. Instead,
Cudi comes out with Man on
the Moon II: The Legend of Mr.
Rager. On the album, he delves
even further into his psycho-
logical pain, twisted soul and
depression. it would appear Kid
Cudi is not fronting.

"You'll never guess where my dragon tattoo is."

'The Girl' loses its sting

By EMILY BOUDREAU
DailyArts Writer
Lisbeth Salander is back, and
she's as pierced and tattooed as
ever in the third
installment of
the Swedish
films adapted The Girl
from Stieg Lars-
son's best-selling Who Kicked
series. the Homet's
Not only
is Salander Nest
(Noomi Rapace) At the
an outstand- Michigan
ing hacker with Music Box
a photographic
memory, but she
seems to be some sort of superhu-
man. The film opens right where
the second left off, with Salander
surviving a shot in the head and
digging her way out of her own
grave. Sadly, she digs her way out
only to face charges of attempted
murder. It's up to Mikael Blom-
kvist (Michael Nyqvist), Saland-
er's journalist friend, and her
lawyer, Anrr ka Giannini (Annika

Hallin), to save the day and unrav-
el the government conspiracy in
which she's been tangled up.
Though engrossing and packed
with assassination attempts,
threatening e-mails and nerve-
racking undercover investiga-
tions, the plot is sometimes hard
to follow. This may be because its
subtitles are packed with names
and places that read like some-
thing out of an IKEA catalog.
While the story manages to
engage viewers beyond its occa-
sional incomprehensibility, the
most captivating character,
Salander, is out of commission
for pretty much the entire film.
In the past two movies, Salander
was established as a cool heroine
with a major attitude and anti-
social tendencies. "The Girl Who
Kicked the Hornet's Nest" is actu-
ally somewhat of a misleading
title. The film doesn't really end
up being about the girl; it's more
about the wonCer-boy journalist
who tries to save her. Ordinar-
ily, the switch from heroine to
hi-co wouldn't be that prltem-

atic, but the purpose of the books
was to establish an alternative
to the Nancy Drew-type female
detective. And, in the past films,
Salander has delivered a femi-
nist message that has the same
strength as her punches.
But this time around, Salander
spends a lot of her time in a jail
cell or recovering from her head

wound and obviously can't be out
hunting down the bad guys. The
book itself is guilty of relegating
Salander to the background as
well, but onscreen her absence is
more evident simply because she
isn't present in the majority of the
scenes. Also, the books provided
alternative storylines for Salander
that highlighted women's issues
including stalking and sex-slave

From the University stage to FOX's 'Glee'
'A Very Potter Musical' star Darren Criss
discusses his new TV role
By Jacob Axelrad I Daily Arts Writer

The University's boy who lived
just landed himself a role on "Glee."
It's time for alum Darren Criss, star
of University and Internet phenom-
enon "A Very Potter Musical," to
work his magic on the FOX sensa-
tion. Tonight the 2009 graduate will
make his first appearance in what
could easily become a recurring role
in the series. And if his work at the
'U' is any indication, his voice and
personality will cast a spell on the
show's millions of viewers.
Criss will play Blaine, an openly
gay student from a rival glee club,
the Dalton Academy Warblers.
Blaine willbe a friend and mentor to
castmate Chris Colfer's openly-gay
character Kurt Hummel. in terms
of Blaine's musical and professional
journey, the character seems to hit
home with Criss and his Ann Arbor
roots.
"(Blaine's) part of a killer glee
club, the Dalton Warblers, much
like the glee clubs that I had so
much fun with while at Michigan,"
Criss said in a recent interview with
the Daily. "Blaine is the first role on
'Glee' that I've really related to. He's
very centered and he's defined by
the trials and tribulations that he's
gone through."

The Warblers will be featured in
their own musical numbers on the
show, giving Criss a chance to really
show off his vocals. Fans can look
for an a cappella rendition of Katy
Perry's "Teenage Dream" in Tues-
day's episode.
Criss exuded enthusiasm when
discussing his character. He hopes
"that the composure Blaine dis-
plays" can serve as an example for
young people struggling with simi-
lar issues of homosexuality.
On another level, he hopes audi-
ences willbe willingto accepthimas
partofthe "Glee"family. As the new-
est cast member to join the show, he
likens his experience to that of being
the new kid on campus.
"It's just like being a freshman
again," Criss said with a lightheart-
ed laugh.
The truth is it wasn't too long ago
that Criss himself was a freshman at
the University. As a BFA acting stu-
dentintheSchoolofMusic,Theater,
& Dance, he was part of the creative
team that put on the shows "Little
White Lie," "A Very Potter Musical"
and "A Very Potter Sequel." Online
videos of the shows led to Internet
stardom for the group of MT&D
students that would subsequently

HORNET'S NEST
From Page 5
trafficking. But these storylines
have been left out of this film
adaptation altogether, leaving
Salander and the story with less
power.
Some of that power is regained
in Salander's climactic trial scene
in which she returns to form -
platform combat boots, Mohawk
and studded leather jacket. She
swaggers in and flops angrily
down into her chair, and the
judges in the courtroom seem
to automatically assume she's
guilty. Her appearance screams
"homicidal problem child."
Yet it is during that scene that
Salander and her lawyer make
fools of everyone in the court-
room and expose their shallow
judgments. She's not what her
appearance suggests at all. In
fact, rather than a murderer,
she's a victim of both society's
cruel assumptions and the labels
forced on her as a result of the
way she chooses to dress and the
life she chooses to lead. Her trial
is the most gripping scene in the
movie because of its message:
It's not just about stakeouts and
gunfights - the trial emphasizes
the feminist roots the rest of the
movie has left behind in order
to become a more traditional
action movie. But as the final
chapter, "The Girl Who Kicked
the Hornet's Nest" should have
resonated more with it's original
message and stuck with what had
distinguished it in the first place.

become the theater group StarKid.
"It was something we did for
fun," Criss said of StarKid. "We
never anticipated anything happen-
ing with it."
While Starkid is still of central
importance for him, he regards it as
very separate from his professional
actingcareer. Yethe's quickto point
out that his time at the University
gave him the preparation he needed
for the life he currently leads.
"There are days when I can con-
cretely point to moments at Michi-
gan that prepared me for the work
I'm doing now," he said.

Criss is still involved with ongo-
ing projects with Starkid. An
upcoming show, "Starship,". for
which Criss wrote the music, will
premiere in Chicago in February.
Criss hopes his attention won't be
too divided to force him to give up
either his newfound TV career or
his longer-standing theater work
with Starkid.
"('Glee' is) going to change the
game a little bit for me," Criss said.
"Right now I'm trying to focus on
both of them."
I While uncertain about his char-
acter's duration on the show, Criss

obviously hopes Blaine will stick
around for a while.
"You hope to see a character like
Blaine coming back," Criss said. "I
really like the guy and he's such a
positive beacon of energy."
Criss's career has taken him far
from Ann Arbor, but he remains
nostalgic for the University that
gave him his start.
"Even when I'm on the beach in
L.A. in the middle of Februarythere
are times when I think, 'I could be
in Ann Arbor right now,' " Criss
said. His parting statement was
simple and direct: "Go Blue!"

FIRESIDE CHAT
From Page 1
diversity)," Coleman said.
Coleman was also asked about
how she reconciles the importance
of diversity and academic excel-
lence. She responded by saying the
University never lowers its aca-
demic standards to increase diver-
sity, but rather that it takes a holistic
approach among qualified appli-
cants thatcincludes looking at a wide
range of factors to build a class of
students with diverse backgrounds
and opinions.
And diversity on campus, Cole-
man said in response to other ques-
tions, is one of the things graduates
say was one of the best parts of
attending the University.
"I'm proud of what we've done,
but we've got a lot of work left to do.

We're not there yet," Coleman said.
The ethnic diversity of the
incoming freshman class of Univer-
sity students increased this year for
the first time since the state passed
a ban on affirmative action, which
took effect in 2007. The population
of underrepresented minority stu-
dents increased from 9.1 percent of
the total freshmen class in 2009 to
10.6 percent of the total freshmen
class this fall.
But topics discussed at yester-
day's fireside chat also included
more light-hearted questions, like
the most recent novel Coleman read.
Coleman said her most recent
read was a book titled "The Pas-
sage," which is about a military
project gone awry and the ensuing
struggle that the only remaining
colony of people in existence face
as the power station that helps to
preventvampires from entering the

city and killing all its citizens begins
to fail.
"It's sort of a vampire book, but
it's not like Twilight," Coleman
said, explaining to the group that
she received the book as a gift when
attending a meeting of University
presidents from across the country
at Rice University earlier this year.
A student followed up with a
question for Coleman about wheth-
er the president also liked the Twi-
light saga by Stephenie Meyer.
"Stephenie Meyer is a genius, and
she's made a lot of money off Twi-
light," Coleman said. "But Twilight
books don't hold a candle to 'The
Passage."
The light-hearted topics also
included questions about Coleman
and Harper's favorite places to eat
near campus. Coleman told stu-
dents she likes to eat at Red Hawk
Bar & Grill on South State Street,

while Harper said she likes to eat
at the Ann Arbor staple Blimpy
Burger.
Another student asked Harper
and Coleman to name one thing on
their bucket lists.
Harper used her iPad to pull up
a copy of her bucket list, joking that
she'd have to look at it to find some-
thing she could share and adding
that she wants to become techno-
logically literate.
"I really love paper and pencils,
and the more beautiful paper is and
the nicer theink is the more Ilike it,"
Harper said, holding up her iPad. "I
really do have to get over that. This
has been a big help for me."
Coleman's list included a more
traditional bucketlist activity - vis-
iting the Inca ruins at Machu Pic-
chu.
"It's high on my list," Coleman
said.

worlds together," he said.
Snyder also eschewed party
labels during the press confer-
ence, saying he chose Dillon and
Posthumus based on their expe-
rience not their party affiliation.
"Let's stop fighting over the
extremes and recognize Michi-
gan is in a crisis," Snyder said.
"And we're going to move for-
ward, we're going to roll up our
sleeves, solve the problems, that's
what the people elected us to do."
Posthumus holds the record
for the longest-serving Senate
majority leader in Michigan and
is also the former CEO of Com-
patico, a furniture manufactur-
ing company in Grand Rapids. In
addition, he served as lieutenant
governor to former Republican
governor John Engler.
SMOKING BAN
From Page 1
go home not smelling like a bar."
Art & Design freshman Mad-
eline Young echoed Evers, saying
she likes the ban because she's
doesn't like the smell of smoke.
"I love the ban," Young said. "I
like not having to go to a bar and
smell like smoke."
Recognizing patrons like Young,
some bar owners are even redeco-
rating to get rid of the old smoke
smell.
Adam Lowenstein, owner of the
Alley Bar on West Liberty Street,

Posthumus's role as a senior
adviser will be to assist Snyder
and his team in developing pub-
lic policy and translating it to
legislation. At the press confer-
ence, Snyder said he looks for-
ward to working with Posthumus
and lauded his vast experience in
both the public and private sec-
tors.
"I'm extremely excited about
having Dick join the administra-
tion," Snyder said. "His back-
ground is absolutely fabulous ...
He's got great legislative experi-
ence. And he's really going to be a
leader in helping us on legislative
affairs."
Posthumus said at the press
conference that he never antici-
pated taking on the role as senior
adviser and merely suggested
Snyder create the position to ease
the transition from the private
sector to the public sector.
"Coming from the outside,

things are a little different to
accomplish in Lansing mode,"
Posthumus said at the press con-
ference. "To accomplish things
in the legislative process is a
little different than the private
sector and I urged him to bring
some people on to assist lieuten-
ant governor-elect (Brian) Calley
in working with the process to
implement legislation for Michi-
gan."
Posthumus said he initially
declined the job because he
"wasn't looking for a job in
administration," but he was soon
persuaded by Snyder to join his
team.
"If any of you a month ago
would have said I would have
been here to talk about this sub-
ject today I would have said you
were crazy," Posthumus said.
"The governor-elect and his
team is pretty persuasive and
they convinced me that maybe

some of the experiences I have in
a very small way could help the
administration succeed so that's
why I'm here today," he contin-
ued.
At the press conference Snyder
said that like Posthumus, Dillon
has a "fabulous combination of
experience" that will be benefi-
cial to the Snyder administration.
Though Dillon was vying to
run as a Democrat for governor
earlier in the year before Lan-
sing Mayor Virg Bernero won the
Democratic nomination, he said
he decided to join Snyder's team
because he's "very impressed
with the governor-elect's vision
for the state."
"We need fundamental change
in Michigan," Dillon said at the
press conference. "I also believe
that because these changes are
so dramatic, we've got to shed the
labels. Democrats and Republi-
cans need to work together."

Armstrong worked this past sum-
mer - during work hours, the
press release states. Shirvell tried
to get Armstrong fired from his job
with Pelosi's office, according to
Cox's statement.
Also, "Shirvell would, at times,
post attacks on Armstrong on the
Internet while at work," Cox wrote
in the press release.
Shirvell is the creator of a blog
titled Chris Armstrong Watch on
which he has accused the MSA
president of promoting a "radical
homosexual agenda."
The decision to fire Shirvell was
also based on his dishonesty with
other assistant attorneys general
who investigated Shirvell's case
throughout his disciplinary hear-
ing, Cox wrote. The disciplinary
hearing to determine Shirvell's
employment status with the state's
attorney general office began on
Friday.
Deborah Gordon, Armstrong's
lawyer, wrote in a statement
released today that Shirvell must
"realize there are consequences
for his reckless, outrageous state-
ments and actions..."
"This is clearly the correct
decision by the attorney general's
office," Gordon wrote. "The next
step must be a complete retraction
of all the malicious lies and fabri-
cations by Mr. Shirvell, and a pub-
lic apology to Chris Armstrong, his
family and the others Mr. Shirvell
has slandered."
Calls to Shirvell'slawyer weren't
immediately returned yesterday.
In a phone interview this eve-
ning, Gordon said Cox's decision to
fire Shirvell didn't come as a sur-
prise.
"I wasn't surprised really
because I looked into the matter,"
she said. "I know the attorney gen-
eral's office has been doing a full
investigation and there's so much
wrongdoing there."
Gordon said she assumes the
panel at the disciplinary hearing
"made a recommendation" to Cox
regarding Shirvell's employment
status.
"I think it had to be an obvious
end for him, for Shirvell," Gordon
said. "You can't conduct yourself
that way and remain an assistant

attorney general."
Gordon said she and Armstrong
intend to follow through with their
complaints to the Michigan Attor-
ney Grievance Commission. They
have requested an investigation of
Shirvell's recent actions and pos-
sible disciplinary action, up to and
including potential disbarment.
Gordon said she also filed a
supplemental complaint, including
Shirvell's blog, with the Attorney
Grievance Commission on Friday.
But there has yet to be any prog-
ress on the complaints filed, she
said.
"Typically, it's not a fast pro-
cess," Gordon said, adding that
there isn't a lot of precedent for a
case of this nature..
Gordon said Shirvell should be
disbarred due to his actions involv-
ing Armstrong.
"He should lose his right to
practice law based on his behav-
ior," Gordon said. "You have to
be trustworthy and reliable and I
don't see (that) that's possible with
him."
In addition to pursuing the com-
plaints with the Attorney Griev-
ance Commission, Gordon said
she and Armstrong are evaluating
other "legal options."
"We continue to look at our
other legal options; no decisions
have been made," she said.
Gordon told the Daily last week
that she and Armstrong believed
Shirvell's actions had been in vio-
lation of the Michigan Rules of
Professional Conduct - a guide
state attorneys must follow. This
alleged violation led Gordon and
Armstrong to file the complaints,
she said at the time.
Shirvell was previously barred
from setting foot on campus due
to a trespass order issued by the
University's Department of Pub-
lic Safety. However, the order was
modified last Wednesday so that
Shirvell can now be on campus but
cannot attend events where Arm-
strong is present, including MSA
meetings.
Gordon said DPS's trespass
order modification was "sensible."
"I think it was a reasonable
decision on their part," Gordon
said. "That's a tough issue, to bar
people from campus completely;
legally that's a tough issue."


said when he took ownership of
the bar in August, he and his part-
ners made an effort to eliminate
the lingering smoke smell by tear-
ing out the old carpet and putting
a fresh coat of paint on the walls.
"Old smoke smell is worse than
new smoke smell," Lowenstein
said. "And the best smoke smell is
no smoke smell."
other local business owners
whose bars were non-smoking
before the ban say they have not
been affected by it.
Ben Hammond, day manager
at Good Time Charley's on South
University Avenue, said the ban
has not impacted business because

the indoor area was already non-
smoking before the ban. However,
customers could smoke in the out-
door caf6.
Since the ban took effect, cus-
tomers cannot smoke in Charley's
outdoor caf6 while eating meals.
Lowenstein, who also owns
Good Time Charley's and BTB
Cantina above Charley's, said he
agrees with the ban but thinks
people should be able to smoke out-
side while being served food.
But Higgins said smokers still
go to restaurants and bars even
though they cannot smoke inside.
"Definitely, there are crowds
outside smoking, but it's not ridicu-

lous," Higgins said.
Higgins, who said the smoking
ban helped him kick his smoking
habit, added that his customers
who smoke still come to Ashley's
despite the fact that they cannot
enjoy their cigarettes at the bar.
"It's not like anyone else offers
smoking," Higgins said. "There's
nowhere else for them to go."
Though a smoker herself, LSA
freshman Brogan Dysert said she
supports the statewide smoking
ban.
"I think it's good because obvi-
ously the health risks of breathing
secondhand smoke, (and) I think it
will help people quit," Dysert said.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.cor

After three bowl-less years,
bid special for Blue's seniors

ByJOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
For each of his first two sea-
sons as Michigan's coach, Rich
Rodriguez had to tell the depart-
ing seniors that, even though they
weren't going to a bowl game, they
were laying the foundation for
future success.
And that's something to be proud
of, to be sure.
But, as Rodriguez said dur-
ing Monday's press conference,
it's especially nice that this year's
seniors will finally get to go to a
bowl.
"The seniors, I think the chance
to extend their college career one
more game is huge," Rodriguez
said. "That bond you have with your
team is pretty tight, and being able
to extend that another month for a
bowl game I think is really impor-
tant for our seniors."
The Wolverines (2-3 Big Ten,
6-3 overall) secured their first bowl
berthof the Rodriguez era on Satur-
day with a dramatic triple-overtime
67-65 victory over Illinois.
One senior, defensive end Ryan
Van Bergen, said that for a lot of
players, achieving bowl eligibility is
a huge relief.
"Being a senior, you feel a lot of
pressure to be a leader and give the
team everything you have," Van
Bergen said at Monday's presser.
"To be a part of the upperclassmen
who got us back on track ... I defi-
nitely feel a pressure lifted off my
shoulders."
For many of the younger players,
giving the seniors a chance to play
in a bowl was an importantmotivat-
ing factor throughout the season.
Junior wide receiver Darryl Sto-
num said the rest of the team talked
about sending the seniors to a bowl
after the game.
"We talked in the locker room
after the game," he said. "A lot of
the guys got kind of emotional. We
love our teammates and our seniors
mean a lot to us. We were happy to
do this for the seniors."
ROBINSON DOING FINE: As has
been the case in nearly every game

Senior forward Amanda Bowery, along with most of her teammates, will see the
postseason for the first time in her Michigan career.
'M'headed for
NCAA Tourney

Redshirtjunior Ryan Van Bergen and the rest of the Michigan seniors will be playing in their first bowl game this winter.

this season, sophomore quarter-
back Denard Robinson went down
with an injury during Saturday's
matchup against the Illini.
The Deerfield Beach, Fla. native
was taken out of the game near the
end of the third quarter and did not
return.
Rodriguez said Robinson was
experiencing concussion-like
symptoms when he was taken out,
and because of this, the team's
trainers kept him out the rest of the
day.
"He got a little dizzy, had a little
headache," Rodriguez said. "So for
precautionary reasons, the trainers
wanted to hold him out."
However, Rodriguez said Rob-
inson went through a series of tests
on Sunday and the results indicated
that he was "okay."
Sophomore quarterback Tate
Forcier performed well in Robin-
son's absence, throwing two touch-
downs over the course of three

overtimes and the time remaining
in regulation.
But barring another injury, it
looks like the team won't need his
services next week. Robinson has
been cleared to practice and will be
fine for the Wolverines' next game
at Purdue.
"He'll do everything today and
be good to go," Rodriguez said.
RYAN VAN SUH?: When asked
about Detroit Lions' defensive tack-
le Ndamukong Suh's extra point
attempt during the Lions game on
Sunday, Van Bergen had an interest-
ing first thought.
"I know I would have made that,"
Van Bergen said. "There's no way
I miss an extra point. I kicked in
high school, my long is 46 (yards),
I would have made that. Ndamu-
kong should be a little embarrassed
- 13-yard field goal, right down the
middle?You got to capitalize."
Van Bergen has a history in the
kicking game. He said he started

kicking for his high school and got
pretty good at it. He even kicked
off in the Michigan East vs. West
game during his senior year of high
school.
Though he made a 35-yarder in
practice, Van Bergen said his skills
have undoubtedlyeroded since high
school. But should he be called upon
to kick a point after?
"If I got called upon, I would
make an extra point for this team,"
he said.
INJURY REPORT: Sophomore
running back Teric Jones left Sat-
urday's game with a leg injury and
Rodriguez informed the media that
Jones tore his ACL and is out for the
season. ... Junior nose tackle Mike
Martin got through the game with-
out aggravating either of his injured
ankles. ... Rodriguez said the
availability of redshirt freshman
Fitzgerald Toussaint will depend
on what he can do in practice this
week.

Hagelins unselfish play draws praise
after weekend split in Fairbanks

Wolverines haven't
been selected since
2006 season
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Just two years after finishing
last place in the Big Ten, Michi-
gan is back where it wants to be
- the NCAA Tournament. With
the women's soccer team packed
around a TV watching ESPNU's
selection show yesterday after-
noon, anxious minutes passed
before it was finally announced
that the Wolverines had made it
for the first time since 2006.,
They will now travel to Stillwa-
ter, Okla. and face Oklahoma State
- the region's host - on Friday.
The Cowboys are the No. 3 seed in
the North Carolina Region.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan -
who guided Wisconsin to two
Final Fours and a runner-up fin-
ish in 1991 - is in his third year
as the Wolverines' head man and
has returned his team to familiar
territory. Before his tenure began,
Michigan had made the tourna-
ment in nine of its last 11 years.
only one player on this roster,
senior defenseman Kylie Neschke,
has any tournament experience.
But for the Wolverines (5-3-
2 Big Ten, 10-4-4 overall), who
haven't had a winning record since
2007, being back on top is incred-
ibly rewarding.
"We knew we weren't going to be
very strong on the field, so we com-
mitted to being good teammates
and getting along and working for
each other," Ryan said. "That's car-
ried over for all three years. I think
when you get to a year where you
have enough talent on the field to
win and you have that great team
chemistry, I think that combination
puts you over the top."
The season has been a magical
ride for the seniors who had gone
through so much. After the show's
conclusion, a nostalgic Ryan
addressed his team, nearly chok-
ingup.
"It's a great credit to this group
of girls who have made the NCAA
Tournament, but it's also a credit
to people of the past few years that
have helped us rebuild the pro-
gram, building the culture, learn-
ing how to fight every second,"
Ryan said. "This is just a gritty
group of players that believed in
themselves when nobody else in
the country believed in them."
With all they've gone through,
the season couldn't have been any
more special for a transforming

soccer program. To begin the sea-
son, Michigan unveiled a brand-
new stadium and discovered a
vibrant fan base. A bid to the tour-
nament just caps it all off.
"It really makes us realize how
far we've come as ateam and as a
senior class," senior captain and
forward Amanda Bowery said. "To
go from our freshman year when
we won three games to now, it feels
really good to look at and reflect
on what we have done. When we
found out freshman year that we
were going to get a new coach, it
was kind of like, 'We know there's
going to be a turnaround in the
program and restructuring,' and
now that we've actually been able
to see it from nothing to now win-
ning, it's really cool."
The'tension built in the room as
the bracket filled up and the Wol-
verines were still absent. Needing
a win or tie to all but secure a bid,
Michigan lost to Penn State on
Sunday in the final 17 seconds of
double overtime.
With banners andstreamersstill
hanging in the locker room from
last week's Senior Day victory, the
players and coaches were loose
prior totheshow's beginning, most-
ly enjoying the large spread of food
and laughing among themselves.
But when three of the four brackets
had been finished, the mood dark-
enedbas the room swelled with ner-
vous words of encouragement and
frustration.
Someone even yelled at com-
mentator Julie Foudy to "shut up"
as she rambled about numerous
matchups.
When Michigan was finally
announced, jubilant yells were
let out in celebration, as the team
hugged and high-fived. After
Ryan's speech, coaches piped in
rock music, yet the celebration was
short lived.
"(Oklahoma State) is obviously
a very, very good team," Ryan said.
"My next hour is going to be call-
ing coaches, figuring out every-
thing I can about them. We'll roll
up our sleeves against anyone in
the country. This team has showed
that all year long."
The Wolverines will head down
to Stillwater onWednesdayin prep-
aration for Friday evening's game
against Big-12 champion Oklahoma
State (8-2-1, 17-3-2). The winner
will advance to play the winner of
Memphis and Oregon State.
"Our gameplan the whole year
has been taking it one step at a
time," Bowery said. "We'll just go
in there Friday, give itour all, leave
it all on the field. This is the point
where one loss is your season.
Then it's done."

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
It didn't mean anything. The
goal only pushed the game fur-
ther out of reach. But senior for-
ward Carl Hagelin's assist on the
Michigan hockey team's fifth goal
of its 5-2 victory over Alaska-
Fairbanks on Saturday may have
been the most intriguing of the
year.
With 1:37 remaining in the
third period and the game already
at 4-2, senior forward Louie
Caporusso let go of a one-timer
for his second goal of the game
and his fourth this season. But it
was the way the play developed
that opened some eyes.
The goal started in the defen-
sive zone. Hagelin picked up the
puck on the left side boards and
came out of the zone with speed.
He beat the Nanook defense-
man to the outside and cut hard
towards the net, setting up the
play that eventually resulted in
Caporusso's goal - the play which
was a prime example of Hagelin's

leaders:

Ain skated in all alone, fastest he's skated all year."
Caporusso joining the The Nanooks had pulled their

puck over to his linemate the goal, when they first gained

*wn on one knee to gain lin's final scoring opportunity
could have ended with an easy
tap-in goal. Instead he showed
the team his selflessness in giving
don't preach up the puck.
"It shows you're a real team
)ut it but ... it's player when you do that," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said. "I
al team player think it's a great move, I've done
it myself. We've had other players
at does that." I've seen do that. I don't preach
about it but I think it's a real team
player that does that, that would
make a pass to a player and give
everage, uncorked a shot them a goal. That's a sign of a
he hashmarks - on the good team or a good leader, a good
et. team player."
t's what you do if you come Said Caporusso: "We've talked
wo-on-zero and no defen- a little before so he kind of knew
back and an empty net," what I was going to do. He knew
i said. "I would have done what to do I guess, pass me the
se thing if the goalie was puck. I tried to do the same thing
too. That's just how you for him against Ferris State ... I
le deserved that goal. He would have done the same for

him."
As a captain this year and an
alternate captain last season,
Hagelin leads the team by exam-
ple on the ice. But this particular
play may have resonated more
because of his struggles to open
the season.
Coming into this season, Capo-
russo and Hagelin were expected
to carry the scoring for the team.
But Hagelin has just three goals
through 10 games while Capo-
russo has just four, including the
empty netter.
Now, with the two playing on
the same line for the past five
games, it could be the spark both
of them need to break out of their
slumps.
"I can probably score a lot more
goals with him on the line, just
trying to get to the net and get
open for him" Caporusso said. "As
opposed to other lines that I've
played on, I felt like I was trying
myself to play-make. I feel like my
play-making doesn't have to be as
prominent as scoring goals when
I'm on his line."

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Young players show spark in Wolverines' final fall action

By MATT KRASNOFF

Senior tennis standout Denise
Mursean wasn't there to defend her
title last weekend at the Arizona
State Thunderbird Tournament.
Instead, the nation's No. 12 player
was busy competing in the presti-
gious USTA/ITA National Indoor
Championships in New York. But
the show mustgo on and so must the
tennis.
Michigan coach Ronni Bern-
stein took the rest of her nine-player
roster to Tempe, Ariz. where the
Wolverines competed in a singles
tournament, consolation matches
and doubles matchups. Michigan
was part of a competitive field that

featured Arizona State, California,
Northwestern, Ohio State, Oregon
and San Diego.
The team has spent a majority of
the fall season playing at home, so it
was nice to get away for a weekend.
"It's always enjoyable to go on a
trip," Bernstein said Sunday. "But it
was the last time we'd see them com-
pete before we start again in January
so of course it's very important."
Every Wolverine played at least
three matches and no one went
home winless. The weekend was
highlighted by freshman Brooke
Bolender's run to the semifinals. Ari-
zona State's Kelcy McKenna - the
nation's No.54 singles player and the
eventual tournament champion -
upended her.

Sam Crister, Michigan's other
freshman, suffered a first-round
loss to No. 80 Pavlina Smatova from
Oregon. But the rookie persevered to
win her next four consolation match-
es, defeating a Big Ten opponent in
each one.
The quality play from the young
guns comes as no surprise to Ber-
nstein. Both players come in with
valuable experience on both the
national and international levels.
Bernstein feels that this experience
has paid major dividends in their
adjustments to becoming Division-S
student-athletes.
Senior co-captains Rika Tatsuno
and Whitney Taney each won three
singles matches, while sophomore
Mimi Nguyen picked up two wins

before a quarterfinals exit. Overall,
Bernstein was certainly pleased with
how her team performed.
"It's a really competitive tourna-
ment that's full of good teams, so
every match was tough," she said.
"We got in a lotcof good matches and
I'm really happy with the results."
The 2009-10 Wolverines were
ranked in the top five nationally for
most of the season. The program had
the honor of hosting regional play in
the NCAA Tournament for the first
time ever.
But after falling in the Sweet 16
in June, this year's senior-led squad
is setting higher goals. Michigan
prided itself last year on its superb
doubles play, winning many impor-
tant doubles points in every Big Ten

dual-play match. This weekend,
however, doubles was not the team's
strong suit.
The Wolverines went 4-5 in dou-
bles, though the No. 4 duo of Taney
and Tatsuno did not play together.
Bernstein acknowledged the impor-
tance of doubles play, but stressed
that the fall is a period of assessment
and evaluation, which is exactly
what took place.
"(Doubles) is one area we've been
consistently good at in years past,"
Bernstein said. "So we need to keep
working on that and figure out our
teams for the season."
It will be more than two months
before Michigan plays its next tour-
nament. The team returns to host the
Wolverine Invitational in mid-Jan-

uary, and the next eight weeks are
crucial to the team's development
goingforward.
"I think we're in good shape,"
Bernstein said. "We go into eight-
hour weeks now but we have to con-
tinue to work hard and we need to
stay healthy and stay in shape when
everyone goes home over break.'
And as the fall season comes to a
close,the Wolverines feelthat they're
prepared to repeat as a force to be
reckoned with across the nation.
"Overall, I think we had a good
fall," Bernstein said. "With whatthe
girls showed this weekend and the
quality of the programs there, we
proved that we're definitely a team
that's going to compete hard and
should be in every match we play."
