THE LAST DANCE

After worker death,
Michigan's attorney
general looking into
subcontractor
By DAVID TAYLOR
For the Daily
The masonry company cur-
rently working on the North Quad
residential and academic complex
is under criminal investigation
by the State Attorney General's
office, according to an official
from the Michigan Occupational
Safety and Health Administra-
tion.
The Attorney General's office
is currently reviewing the Fehru-
ary 2008 on-site death at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of
Art, of.3-y3ear-old Leo Felty, Jr.,
a -worker for the subcontractor
Davenport Masonry, Inc.
Felty, a Pinckney, Mich.
native, fell from scaffolding last
February while working on the
$42-million addition to UMMA.
He was nearly 40 feet from the
ground when he stepped back-
wards off of his scaffold, which,
according MIOSHA construction

safety standards, should have had
a guardrail installed on all open
sides. He died on impact, officials
confirmed.
In response, MIOSHA cited
Davenport Masonry for four sep-
arate violations of construction
safety standards, totaling $61,600
in fines. Three of those were clas-
sified as "willful violations," the
most serious form of OSHA cita-
tions.
Davenport Masonry has
appealed the citations, according
to MIOSHA Construction Safety
and Health Division Director Bob
Pawlowski.
The gravity of citations classi-
fied as "willful" merit automatic
referral to the Michigan Attorney
General's office, Pawlowski said.
"When we issue willful vio-
lations, as we did in this case,
they're directly associated with
a fatality," Pawlowski said.,"This
means that an employer knew
of certain rules, and consciously
ignored them ... We are required
by law to send it to the criminal
division of the Attorney General's
office."
The Office of the Attorney
General is "currently reviewing

Detroit educators respond to
ColeOman' ,sd "-Irec4OA,1ruit ment efforts

Officials: President's
pitch may push more
students to apply
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Though the number of underrep-
resented minority students enrolled

at the University is decreasing, edu-
cators working in Detroit Public
Schools said University President
Mary Sue Coleman's trips to the
city's schools may be helping to
change that.
For every year since the passage
of a state constitutional amendment
in 2006 that banned the use of race-
based affirmative action, the num-
her of underrepresented minority

students enrolled at the University
has declined. According to data
released by the University in Octo-
ber, underrepresented minority
freshman enrollment is down 11.4
percent from last year.
in an effort to curb this decrease,
Coleman has been traveling to
Detroit and speaking to students
in hopes of encouraging them to
consider the University as a viable

post-high school option. in a series
of interviews over the last several
weeks, many Detroit educators said
the tactic is a practical solution to
stem the underrepresented minor-
ity enrollment declines.
In October, Coleman spoke to
hundreds of Detroit educators at the
2009 Wolverine Outreach Workshop
reception, which aimed to inspire

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
White House
crashers served
with subpoena
Congress authorized subpoenas
yesterday for the White House gate-
crashers to testify about how the
couple got into a state dinner without
an invitation.
Lawmakers on the House Home-
land Security Committee voted
yesterday to compel the attention-
hungry couple to answer questions
about the Nov.24 incident.
The couple, Tareq and Michale
Salahi, have said they will invoke
their Fifth Amendment right to
refuse to answer questions.
Secret Service Director Mark Sul-
livan has said normal security pro-
tocols weren't followed, and three
uniformed Secret Service officers
have been placed on administrative
leave.
While the committee authorized
subpoenas for the Salahis, it would
not accept its top Republican's pro-
posal to subpoena White House
social secretary Desiree Rogers.

Hundredsofgovernmentsupport-
ers shouted insults and pro-Castro
slogans at about 50 wives, mothers
and other female relatives of Cuban
political prisoners as they marched
yesterdaythroughacrowded Havana
neighborhood in the name of human
rights.
There were no injuries among
the "Women in White," a political
opposition group that holds small,
silent marches along Fifth Avenue in
a wealthier part of the Cuban capital
each Sunday after attending Roman
Catholic Mass. The women dress
head-to-toe in white.
The demonstrations usually only
go for a few blocks and rarely draw
the ire of supporters of Fidel and
Raul Castro, nor do they generate
much support among the general
population, who know little about
the dissidents.
But this time, the group left
from the central Havana apart-
ment of Laura Pollan, one of the
organization's founders and the
wife of Hector Maceda, who is
serving a 20-year prison sentence
for his political views. They also
marched for more than an hour.

DETROIT
From Page 1A
more students from Detroit Public
Schools to apply to the University.
Thomas Moss, assistant princi-
palatCooleyHigh School inDetroit
and a University alum, said in an
e-mail interview that the reception
urged educators to encourage stu-
dents who would normally apply to
schools like Wayne County Com-
munity College or Wayne State
University to give the University of
Michigan's applicationa try.
in a school where 99 percent of
the student population is African-
American, according to www.pub-
licschoolreview.com, Moss said
that economic and academic barri-
ers commonly discourage students
capable of excelling at the Univer-
sity from even applying. in order
to cut down these barriers, Moss
said that more guidance counsel-
ors have been hired to "insure aca-
demic continuity and success for
all of our students."
Moss said that Coleman's speech
and the efforts of other University
officials have helped to supplement
the work of the school's guidance
counselors.
"They've encouraged those of us
who are front-line players in this
ever-changing landscape of pub-
lic education to keep pushing our
young charges to stay focused on
their very attainable life by maxi-
mizing on all of their opportuni-
ties," he said.
Moss said that while some
Detroithigh schools likeCassTech-
nical High School, Renaissance
High School, King High School
and Communication and Media
Arts High School are "prime areas
for Detroit public school recruit-
ment," other schools including
Cooley High School, Denby High
School, Osborn College Preparato-
ry Academy, Cody College Prepara-
tory Upper School of Teaching and
Learning and Central High School
are not - meaning that students
in the first group would be more
likely to attend the University than
those in the second group.
Kenyetta Wilbourn, principal
of Denby High School in Detroit,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
she is satisfied with the support

that the University has shown to
her school through the years, but
does have a few recommendations.
She suggested that the Univer-
sity put more emphasis-on "teach-
ing the students how to complete
applications, test-taking skills, and
how to matriculate at higher levels
of learning."
Ken Watson, the college and
scholarship coordinator of Central
High School, said that while the
University currently helps his stu-
dents prepare for the SAT and sends
guest speakers to talk about the
benefits of a college education, he
envisions the University eventually
playing a larger role in encouraging
the school's students to apply.
Central is currently undergoing
a transformation to help the school
better promote a college-going cul-
ture. Watson explained that Cen-
tral aims to house educators from
Michigan colleges directly within
its school walls in order to give stu-
dents first-hand access to informa-
tion about colleges.
Watson said the success of this
initiative is crucial because the stu-
dents who willreap the benefits "will
for the most part be first generation
ofcollege goers" intheir family.
He added that he hopes the Uni-
versity members will participate
because "they are the leaders of
our state."
According to William Collins,
director of the University's Cen-
ter for Educational Outreach and
Academic Success, the aim of Cole-
man's speech at the reception was
to encourage college-going culture
among underrepresented minority
students in Detroit Public Schools.
"President Mary Sue Coleman
spoke about her own interests
in having a diverse student body
here," he said.
Ted Spencer, associate vice pro-
vost and executive director of the
Office of Undergraduate Admis-
sions, said this year was the first
time that the Wolverine Outreach
Workshop spoke directlyto "prima-
rypeopleintheDetroitpublicschool
system" like superintendents, prin-
cipals and guidance counselors.
"For our president to go down
and talk about our commitment
to Detroit and how we want to do
everything we can to encourage
Detroit public school students is

vitallyessential andextremelyhelp-
ful to any effort that we have for
attracting students," Spencer said.
In her speech, Coleman used the
story of University alum Jawuan
Meeks as an example of a stu-
dent who came from Detroit and
achieved success at the University
and beyond. Meeks - now a middle
school teacher in physics and geog-
raphy in Boston - said he decided
to apply to the University after
hearing a speech like Coleman's
from a University representative at
his high school.
"I think that students need to
know that getting to college is
believable, something that can
happen," he said.
Though Spencer said that "in
terms of a specific area, (Detroit)
is certainly one of the largest
areas in the state and perhaps in
the country that (the University)
receives applications from and
(has) students enrolled from," he
believes there is always room for
further improvement.
"Our biggest effort is making
certain that we program better
with the city of Detroit and make as
many students and faculty and staff
aware of those programs," he said.
One such program is in the
works, according to University
alum Thomas Parker, principal of
the new Osborn College Prepara-
tory School. He said his school
is working on partnering with
the University to encourage stu-
dents to apply for the University
by exposing them to it as early as
ninth grade.
In addition to an upcoming field
trip to the University, Parker said
he is planning for "financial train-
ing and college application work-
shops in the spring with the ninth
graders to prepare them before
tiey get to 12th grade, with the
expectations that they should be
doing it now." 16
Parker said that so far, the Uni-
versity has been "very responsive"
to his efforts to forge a relation-
ship between the two schools. He
added, "They're ready and waiting
to help and assist in any way."

CHINA
From Page 1A
China is incredibly important,
and the strong economy has led
the developing middle class to
be able to afford an international
education.
"(Education)is the main means
of social mobility in China," Gal-
lagher wrote. "if you succeed
academically in China, you can
break down other barriers of dis-
crimination."
She went on to note that for
many of these middle-class par-
ents, post-secondary education in
the United States is so attractive
because they believe fluency in
English is imperative for success.
Similarly, Brown said that it's
difficult to find a job straight out
of college in China, and a U.S.
education may serve as a leg-up.
"You either want to get into
the top-tier school in China," she
said. "Or you want to maybe beat
out the competition by having an
American degree."
John Greisberger, director of
the University's International
Center, said that while highly
regarded universities and colleg-
es do exist in China, there is not
.enough space to accommodate
every student who wants to go on
to higher education.
"My understanding is that
there still aren't sufficient ter-
tiary institutions in China to
accommodate all those in China
who want to go on to higher edu-
cation," Greisberger said. "And
so the Chinese need to look to
another country for opportuni-
ties, and the U.S. is well-known
as being the best place in the
world to go for higher educa-
tion, and we're at one of the best
schools in the country."
Robyn Wang, an LSA senior, is
originally from the Canton Prov-
ince of China.
When asked why she chose to
study in the United States, and
more specifically at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, she said it

was mainly because America
has a better educational system
than her native china, and that
"Michigan has a good reputa-
tion."
Like Wang, Gallagher noted
that the University is an appeal-
ing place for Chinese students
because "it is a large, well-known
research university with strong
historical ties to China."
In an effort to promote and
strengthen these ties, the Univer-
sity established a joint institute
with Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni-
versity in 2006 and with Peking
University in 2009.
According the Griesberger,
these joint institutes permit stu-
dents to study for two years in
China and then two years at the
University, ultimately earning
degrees from both institutions.
They also allow for a "strategic
global partnership" between the
two universities, as stated on the
UM-SJTU Joint Institute website.
Though it's unclear whether
the joint institutes have led to the
increase in Chinese students at
the University or vice-versa, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man spoke of the University's
ongoing efforts to increase the
school's international outreach,
in particular to China, during
a fireside chat with students on
Tuesday.
Coleman mentioned the pos-
sibility of opening an office
in China to make information
about the University available
to prospective students, as well
improve connectionswith under-
graduates. ,
With China's ever-growing
presence in the world economy
and the influx of Chinese col-
lege students, Coleman said she
believes it's time to "re-think"
the way the University interacts
with international students.
"For us, the notion is to have
successful programs that people
can see that we deliver very high
quality programs, high quality
education," Colemansaid."That's
part of the changing dynamic."

LANSING, Mich.
Battle over school
funding continues

Michigan lawmakers still haven't
agreed on ways to generate more
money for schools as a key deadline
approaches.
A $127 per student cut in state aid
will be reflected in checks sent to
schools Dec. 21 unless lawmakers
agree on awayto avoid it.
Democratic House Speaker Andy
Dillon yesterday criticized a Senate
Republican proposal that includes
freezing a tax credit for low-income
workers to raise money for schools.
Dillon says that plan has provisions
that would wind up costing the state
money through tax breaks and lost
federal matching funds.
Republicans stood by their pro-
posals yesterday. The Republican-
led Senate has not approved a House
Democratic plan to use more stimu-
lus money for schools now because
that would make schools' financial
situation worse in 2011.
DETROIT
Ex-Detroit mayor
violated parole
The Wayne County prosecutor
says former Detroit Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick violated his 'probation by
not following court orders and fail-
ing to make full restitution payments
to the city.
Kym Worthy says in a statement
she will file a motion against Kilpat-
rick. Details of the motion were not
released.
Kilpatrick agreed to pay $1 mil-
lion in restitution as part of pleas to
two criminal cases. He says he cut
his $6,000 monthly payments in half
after his salary as a salesman was
O reduced.
Testimony in a restitution hearing
ended yesterday. Wayne County Cir-
cuit Court Judge David Groner told
prosecutors the hearing is to decide
whether Kilpatrick will pay more or
less each month in restitution.
Closing arguments in the case
will be heard Jan. 12, followed
by Groner's ruling on Jan. 20.

MSA's group work
Assembly's constitutional revision process needs openness
ast month, the Central Student Judiciary ruled, with
considerable irony, that the Michigan Student Assembly's
attempts to amend its constitution were unconstitutional.
This was due to the fact that constitutional convention delegates
were appointed rather than elected by the student body, a clear
violation of the rules for amending the constitution. Though MSA
leaders are now pursuing another method of rewriting its consti-
tution, many of the same concerns still exist - namely, that the
process is too exclusive. They should actively involve students in
the process to rewrite its constitution, and students should join
the effort.

ADRIAN CHOY I

E-MAIL ADRIAN AT AWCHOY@UMICH.EDU

A very Jewish Christmas

There are several different ways that
MSA can revise its constitution. At the
start of the semester, MSA leaders had
formed a constitutional convention
whose delegates were picked by President
Abhishek Mahanti from a pool of inter-
ested applicants. But now that CSJ has
disbanded the convention on the grounds
that these appointments are unconstitu-
tional, MSA leaders are using a different
method. Former members of the conven-
tion have formed a student group - Stu-
dents for Progressive Governance. If the
group garners 1,000 signatures from stu-
dents., its proposals will be put up for a
campus-wide vote.
The problem is that this student group
doesn't appear to be much different from
the constitutional convention. It consists
of about 20 members from the original
convention, including MSA leaders like
Vice President Mike Rorro, Student Gen-
eral Counsel Jim Brusstar and Rules and
Elections Committee Chair Michael Ben-
son. But more concerning, membership
in the student group is only available to
students who are nominated by a cur-
rent member and approved by a majority
of group members. While that might be
good enough to survive CSJ scrutiny, it
shouldn't be good enough for the group.
After all, the constitution mandates a
student-wide election rather than appoint-
ments for delegate positions for a reason.
Students for Progressive Governance is a
body with a considerable amount of power
to impact students' lives. Keeping a strong
hold over who can join this student group is

all too similar to appointing convention del-
egates. In both cases, MSA leaders have too
much control over which students partici-
pate in the constitutional revision process.
While deficient student interest in MSA
is a problem - with student turnout at
only about 9 percent in the recent elec-
tion - it's unlikely to be improved by a
constitutional revision process in which
you have to know someone in the group to
get in. If there are passionate students out
there interested in reforming campus gov-
ernment, such an approval process won't
encourage them to be active. All students
should be able to join the group without
undergoing a nominating and approval
process.
In addition to discouraging interested
students, restricting the group's mem-
bership will only give credence to argu-
ments that assembly leaders don't tolerate
dissent. By opening up the group to any
interested student, MSA leaders can dem-
onstrate that they don't want any views
to be excluded. SSch a policy could only
benefit the group, and by extension, MSA
leaders.
Despite its shortcomings, MSA has the
power to weigh in on important Univer-
sity issues on behalf of students. If stu-
dents want MSA to be making the right
calls - and for administrators to listen
- they need to show more interest in the
assembly by voting in its elections and
participating in groups like Students for
Progressive Governance. But the process
has to be more accessible for students to
care.

ach December, it seems that
some of my acquaintances
still struggle with wishing
me well for the
holidays. True
to form, they get
out the first syl-
lable of "merry"
before correcting
themselves with
a "Happy Hanuk- -4
kah" or "Happy
Holidays" upon
remembering MATTHEW
that I'm Jewish.
That's thought- GREEN
ful, but not
entirely nec-
essary. Some
Jews may resent what they see as a
Christian tradition being pushed on
them, but I think they're just kind
of missing the point. I am delighted
when someone cheerily wishes me a
"Merry Christmas," and I don't con-
sider it an assault against my Jewish-
ness.
At any rate, it's fairly well estab-
lished that Christmas is effectively a
national holiday in this country. For
Christian faithful, this can under-
standably be a point of frustration.
To put it into terms I can compre-
hend more readily, if Jewish boys and
girls suddenly forgot the meaning
of the high holidays and associated
them with revelry, sweets and mate-
rial gain, no small number of bub-
bies would be up in arms about it. It's
worth pointing out that there's still
a lot of importance in the liturgical
Christmas for many Christian Ameri-
cans.
But whether it's due to Frosty the
Snowman or Ulysses S. Grant's 1870

decision to make Dec.25 a federal hol-
iday, Americans from a variety of reli-
gious backgrounds are happy to hang
stockings and decorate trees. There-
fore, if one can accept that Christmas
is increasingly becoming a secular
holiday in the U.S., I would argue that
it's possibly the most Jewish of Ameri-
can holidays, or at least one in which
Jews should feel comfortable taking
some small part.
Aside from the fact that Christmas
commemorates the birth of history's
most famous Jewish boy, Jews have
been contributing to Yuletide tradi-
tion ever since 1840, when German-
Jewish composer Felix Mendelssohn
wrote the song that would become
"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing." It's
undeniable that from "White Christ-
mas" to "Sleigh Ride" and scores of
other favorites, the works of Jewish
composers make up an enormous per-
centage of carols. And at that, some of
the most iconic seasonal recordings
have been by Jewish artists like Bar-
bra Streisand, Mel Torme, Kenny G
and Harry Connick, Jr.
Members of the Tribe have fur-
thermore helped write, act, produce
and direct innumerable Christmas
films. And insofar as department
stores have had ajhand in developing
the modern conception of Christmas,
the historical connection between
Jews and retail has, therefore, even
further influenced the holiday.
It's partly this understanding of
how my people have helped to add
magic to the Christmas tradition that
has kept me at peace with the holi-
day's December dominance. Yet, tak-
ing a step back, what further fills me
with warmth is the symbolic mean-
ing behind any and all Jewish contri-

butions to the American Christmas
tradition. Only in America could
countless members of a historically
persecuted religious minority enrich
the traditions of a holiday at least
rooted in the religion of that group's
past oppressors.
I don't groan if
somebody says,
"Merry Christmas."
As a Jew, it may intrigue me to find'
out that "Silver Bells" was composed
by one of my own. But any prideI feel
from hearing that fact comes mainly
from the knowledge that I live in a
society in which that sort of religious
symbiosis is all around me. And it is
with that pride that I have come to
love the Christmas season.
I'm not saying that Jews should
trade their menorahs for evergreens
and ornaments or even assimilate
in the smallest way into the main-
stream.I, for one, will probablyspend
December 25th in a Chinese res-
taurant somewhere with my family.
But I refuse to feel ashamed for my
love of Christmastime, and I believe
other American Jews should embrace
the jolly spirit of the holiday as well.
Christmas, so I've been told, is a time
for peace, goodwill and togetherness,
in addition to the requisite food and
presents. And as far as Ican tell, Jews
love all of those things, too.

Art Program that JAMIE
would require BLOCK
only half a percent
of the funds des-
ignated for city
developments and infrastructure be

to the full one percent the program
is currently given. In a time when
millions of dollars in budget cuts
are necessary in Ann Arbor, this is
a great step, and possibly even not
going far enough. (And if an arts edi-
tor is saying this, you know it must
be true.)
The public art fund will stand
at a hefty $1.5 million at the end of
the fiscal year, as it has been accu-
mulating for some time. Surely this
is enough money to last the city for
a while. Protesters of the program
change claim that now there won't
be enough money for public art. But
if we've already let it accumulate this
much without spending enough to
counter its growth, then there's not
an urgent need to keep it expanding
at the current rate. One percent of
the development budget has clearly
been more than enough.
Many arts enthusiasts vehemently
argue that if cuts are to be made, they
must be made elsewhere. But Ann

Arbor Mayor John Hieftje is already
proposing a three-percent pay cut for
all city employees, so art is not the
only part of budget from which bits
and pieces are being chipped away.
But on a more pragmatic level,
there just isn't a need for more public
art in Ann Arbor. We live in a town
that's pretty artsy as it is - the city
bike racks even say "art" on them.
Slowing development of future pub-
lic art projects is a risk we can afford
to take when compared to the idea of
skimping on city infrastructure and
density development. Plus, it doesn't
seem like we're anywhere near using
up the public art budget we already
have.
So good work, council, but maybe
you haven't gone far enough. With
that hefty wad of cash already set
aside for beautifying our streets,
why not just put a hold on the Per-
cent for Art Program altogether? We
don't need more art right now. Those
who claim the city will lose its repu-
tation as an artsy town neglect the
fact that first you need to actually
have a functioning city with bridges
that don't collapse and buildings that
aren't falling apart. Once the bud-
get is back on track and Ann Arbor's
infrastructure is repaired, we can
reconsider the art program. But until
then, it's a finicky thing to fuss over.
Perhaps part of the problem is that
the art projects the Council inves-
tigates are often absurd - and so
are their price tags. City Council is
considering spending $850,000 on
a German artist's concept for what
looks like, in all fairness, a short col-
umn on a wet ramp near some trees.
At least support a local artist if you're
going to commission a weird project
like this, and find one willing to do

it for a much lower price tag. If the
city is goingto spend so much money
on a single, unexciting art piece, it's
no wonder people are saying the $1.5
million isn't enough. The way we're
spending the money, it really won't
be enough. But the way we're spend-
ing it is also just plain dumb.
Infrastructure, job
retention higher
priorities right now.
But there is a right way to spend
money on the arts, even in this
economy, and it can be seen in my
hometown of Washington, D.C. The
National Endowment for the Arts
distributes stimulus money to arts
groups, and one of the criteria for
acquiring money is to demonstrate
that the failing economy had forced
your organization to eliminate cer-
tain job opportunities. According to
a story in the The Washington Post,
the program is working. Promoting
arts institutions in a way that keeps
people employed is the best of both
worlds. We keep our reputation of
being focused on the arts, and we
keep our residents employed. Given
the choice between funding arts
programs so they can keep provid-
ing jobs and erecting a wet, German
pillar in front ofCity Hallwe should
go with funding the programs.

SALT IN THE WOUND

Despite Harris's 25
points, Michigan
can't keep up in
68-52 loss at Utah
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
SALT LAKE CITY - It couldn't
have been clearer last night. Or
in any of the Michigan basketball
team's losses this season, for that
matter.
The Wolverines need someone
not named Manny Harris to step
up.
Harris led the team in points
(25), rebounds (six) and steals
(four). He hit shots from beyond
the arc, an area that Michigan has
struggled with most this season.
And he hardly saw the bench.
But his heroics weren't enough.
The Wolverines (4-4) suffered a
very frustrating 68-52 defeat to
Utah (5-4) at the Huntsman Cen-
ter.
"Manny's played so many min- rPJPHOTO
utes, he needs a rest," Michigan Sophomore JaceTavita and the Utes dowsed Mchigan lost nitht in Salt Lake City.

Novak's absence leaves
too large a void for Blue

apparently was, especially on
a night where all of Michigan's
weaknesses were exposed.
Rebounding was the most glar-
ing. Utah, thanks in large part to
the play of massive 7-foot-3 center
David Foster, owned the boards.
The Utes outrebounded the Wol-
verines 41-25, but perhaps most
importantly, they collected 10
offensive rebounds in the first half
alone. Utah capitalized on its sec-
ond - and in many cases, third or
fourth - chances to build an eight-
point lead at the half.
The Utes also exploited another
Michiganweakness, its size, rather
easily. The Wolverines have played
a small lineup for much of the sea-
son, but due to the illness of soph-
omore guard Zack Novak and the
size of the Utes' frontcourt, they
were forced to go big last night.
Novak missed the game with a
case of gastrointestinal flu. Senior
forward DeShawn Sims, who fin-
ished the game with 10 points,
didn't talk to the media after the
game because he said he didn't
feel well. Beilein said he was con-
cerned Sims may have the same ill-
ness as Novak.
With Novak ill, Michigan devi-

senior forward Zack Gibson.
"In the first half, when we
played both big guys together,
it did not work very well," Beil-
ein said. "We didn't know Zack
(Novak) wasn't going to play until
(Tuesday) night. We made a few
adjustments to playing big going
into this game, but we were really
out of sync with our defense."
And that defense - both inte-
rior and along the perimeter -
couldn't keep up with the dynamic
Utah offense.
The Utes penetrated the paint
at will, and when they felt a little
resistance, they passed the ball
out to the 3-point line and a Utah
guard launched a three. Many
times, that shot would fall - and
each time, it felt like a dagger for
the Wolverines.
Michigan's 3-point attempts, on
the other hand, clanged off the rim
for most of the night.
Excluding Harris' 3-of-5 night
from beyond the arc, the rest of
the team shot a miserable 4-of-17
(23.5%). That, coupled with some
bobbled passes and lethargic play,
provoked Beilein to criticize his
guards' performance.

"Right now, the guard play is
not real good, and we just keep
working at it, just keep working
at it," he said. "It's not the biggest
evil right now. There (are) a lot of
issues right now we need to get
better at."
"We've got a lot
of the season left
and we just got
to pick it Up."
And that's precisely what last
night's loss clearly explained.
Michigan has struggled defen-
sively, on the boards and with its
shooting. But until last night, all of
those struggles hadn't coincided
so dramatically.
"It's frustrating, but the bad
thing is we're 4-4, and the good
thing is we've got a lot of the sea-
son left and wejust got to pick itup
now," Harris said.

used through its first seven games,
and Beilein started both Sims and S U 2

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
SALT LAKE CITY - Last night,
there was a glaring, gaping hole in
the Michigan basketball team.
Its heart was missing.
Or rather, sophomore guard Zack
Novak was missing.
He hasn't been the go-to guy in
the Wolverines' offense, or even the
key to the their 1-3-1 zone defense.
But when Michigan needs someone
to dive across the floor for a loose
ball or bleed for the team, he's the
guy.
Two nights ago, Novak came
down with gastrointestinal flu. He
felt fine until the Wolverines' prac-
tice Tuesday night in Salt Lake City.
There, he began feelingill and start-
ed to vomit.
Michigan coach John Beilein
said that Novak had trouble "keep-
ing anything down" until last night.
The sophomore didn't leave the
team's hotel to come to the game
against Utah.
"We miss him a lot, we absolutely
miss him a lot," Beilein said after
Michigan's 68-52 loss. "That is one
guy we can always depend on. He's
always going to block his man out.
He's always going to hustle. He's
always going to do some pretty good
things."
With Novak out of the lineup,
players like senior forward Zack

Gibson, sophomore guard Stu Doug-
lass and freshman Eso Akunne saw
increased playing time.
Gibson started in Novak's
place, giving Michigan a chance
to showcase a big lineup with Gib-
son and senior forward DeShawn
Sims simultaneously on the court.
According to Beilein and evidenced
by Utah's eight-point halftime lead,
the strategy didn't work.
Beilein also put Douglass and
Akunne on the court in an attempt
to get the Wolverines' guard play
to click. Douglass saw his time
increase to 27 minutes, and Akunne
17. Though that additional time on
court didn't translate to points -
Douglass led the pair with just five
- it still helped Michigan gain one
thing it can't in practice: experi-
ence.
"Our guards are just so young,
(and) we're playing very young,"
Beilein said. "We just got to contin-
ue to get more experience and keep
teaching them."
That word "young" came up
multiple times last night, and it
was always with the same message,
With a young team, the cure is usu-
ally in upperclassman leadership.
But on this team, Novak, a second-
year player, is expected to be one
of the team's on- and off-the-court
leaders this season.
"We missed him a lot - just his
hard work, aggressiveness, his

offense, everything," junior guard
Manny Harris said. "No excuses.
Our team should have still found a
way to pull out the win."
Harris is another player Michi-
gan has looked to for guidance, and
the junior successfully led by exam-
ple last night by scoring 25 points.
The next steps, though, are tougher.
He needs to become a more vocal
leader, and then it's time to get the
team on the same page mentally.
"It's not good right now," Harris
said. "We've got a find a way to get
everyone's confidence back up, get
everybody mentally into it. It's not
good right now, but I know it'll get
there."
NOTES: In the waning minutes
and with the game's outcome all but
decided, the Utah student section
began chanting, "Just like football."
For Michigan fans, it's a painful
reference to last fall's football game,
in which Utah beat Michigan 25-23
in Ann Arbor. That was the first
shock of the Rich Rodriguez era,
and the win jumpstarted the Utes'
undefeated season. Their 2008 cam-
paign ended with a Sugar Bowl win
over Alabama.
Accordingto Utah's athletic web-
site, the Utes received $800,000 to
play in the football contest, and the
deal included an agreement for' a
home-and-home basketball series.
Utah will come to Crisler Arena
next season to complete the deal.


Phillips stepping up for Wolverines

By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
Krista Phillips has found her
groove - and it's no surprise that,
as the tallest player on the team,
she has built that momentum
smack in the middle of the paint.
Despite Iowa's physicality and
tall lineup (six players above six
feet tall), the senior scored 15
points, the majority in the paint,
and was the Michigan women's
basketball team's top scorer in the
its first Big Ten test of the season.
Phillips has now scored in dou-
ble digits in Michigan's last three
games and is almost doubling her
point-per-game average from last
year. She is emerging as a consis-
tent weapon for the Wolverines
- a much-needed one after last
season's offensive woes.
After an injury early last season,
Phillips averaged just six points
per game. She continually strug-
gles with her footwork, and while
it is not yet perfect, she has figured
out a way to get around that.
"She understands what we are
trying to do, she totally gets that
picture," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "The footwork is the
part she is probably challenged
most with and that's the area we're
really trying to deal with."
While the Wolverines (1-0 Big
Ten, 6-2 overall) haven't shot well
frombehind the arctheyhave made
a habit of feeding the ball to Phillips
under the basket, and the 6-foot-6
center is producing.
But it will become much more

Senior Krista Phillips scored 15 points in an upset of Iowa last Saturday.

difficult for Phillips to camp out
down low as the Wolverines get
into conference play. She will need
to adjust to the bigger players and
a more physical style of play oth-
erwise, opponents will push her
out from the post, as New Mexico
State did in its win over Michigan
two weeks ago.
That strategy eliminated her
chances to score in the game's
waning moments.
"When she plays against those
big Big Ten kids, they are going to
move her four feet off that lane,"
Borseth said. "She's going to have
to get craftier or we're going to have
to get craftier in how we use her,
because scoring in that paint is very
important."
Another advantage to Phillips'
size is that it attracts attention.

which opens up the perimeter for
her teammates. In three of her four
highest-scoring games in the paint,
her teammates took advantage of
the open shots an hit 50 percent or
better.
"They might double her, or even
just pulling her defender closer
to her helps us," freshman guard
Jenny Ryan said. "So if we get
the ball moving, it opens it up so
much."
Staying in her lane will be an
ongoing battle as the season pro-
gresses, but Phillips looked prom-
ising in Sunday's win over the
HIawkeyes (0-1, 5-4).
.Now she just needs to stand
her ground in tomorrow's game
against Boston College (5-3) if
the Wolverines hope to snap the
Eagles' five-game winning streak.

"Traditionally, I have been a one-

last year, we had two I thoughtcould
play, and then it was up to them to
show us who is the starting goalie."
This year, Hogan has made that
decision easy.

:

Junior Bryan Hogan has been the only goalie to log minutes for the Wolverines this season.

good times with others. Get out and
schmooze! Accept invitations to party.
Partnerships are unusually warm and
fun.

than that, bosses and VIPs really appre-
ciate your efforts. (You can earn points
today!)
GEMINI
(May 21 to0June 20)
A new flirtation could be exciting
today, especially with someone from
another background or a different coun-
try. In fact, it might even seem like a
dream come true.
CANCER
(June 21 to0July 22)
Family relationships are warm and
friendly today. People are ready to help
each other or listen sympathetically to
each other. Encourage gatherings at
home. Entertain friends!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Because you're so intuitive in your
conversations with others, you will fit
right in wherever you go today. It's easy
to be upbeat, optimistic and friendly to
everyone.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Everything having to do with busi-
ness, commerce and financial matters
looks good today. You night boost your

You feel warm and friendly toward
everyone today, and others feel friendly

welfare of others. It's a feel-good day.

SCORPIO

go for a walk or a drive. You need down-
time just for you.
SAGITTARIUS

and rewarding today. You appreciate the

you (and perhaps vice versa).

are people in power - bosses, VIPs and
such. They notice your ability to net-

Travel opportunities or chances to fur-
ther your education are excellent today.
Look around you. Something might
open up where you least expect it.
(Enjoy the beauty of your surroundings

PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
A sympathetic person might help you
today or show generosity to you.
Alternatively, you might share whatever
you can with someone who needs it.
YOU BORN TODAY You are goal-
oriented and purposeful. You're never
casual about what you do. Because
you're conscientious about your respon-
sibilities, people know they can rely on
you. You're resilient and courageous in
the face of difficulty. Nothing will stop
you. You also have the ability to influ-
ence others. Your year ahead can be one
of the best, most powerful years of your
life!

plex, which is located next door
to building.
Police also arrested 18-year-
old Ian MacKenzie in connection
with the fire.
The prosecutor told Easthope
that Arens has "a significant
criminal history" for someone of
his age. Arens, who is 21, has pre-
viously been convicted of home

invasion and retail fraud, among
other crimes. The prosecutor
also cited substance abuse issues
as reasons to keep the bond at
$100,000.
The court order lists Arens's
address as an area homeless shel-
ter, but the prosecutor said he
probably wasn't actually living at
the shelter at the time of the fire.
Easthope said he would keep
the bond set where it is and
revisit the issue during the Dec.
16 hearing.

INVESTIGATION

will prosecute," Pawlowski said.
"They will inform us when they
decide - to our knowledge, they
haven't made a final decision."
Office of the Attorney Gen-
eral Spokesman Nick De Leeuw
refused to give information about
when a decision whether to pros-
ecute would be reached, but Paw-
lowski said he anticipates it would

be made within the next few
months.
MIOSHA has inspected Dav-
enport Masonry on eight sepa-
rate occasions over the past five
years and has cited the company
for more than a dozen safety vio-
lations, according to records on
the U.S. Department of Labor's
website.
Several calls to officials from
Davenport Masonry over the last
week went unreturned.
Marina Roelofs, the executive
director of Architecture, Engi-
neering and Construction at
the University, said Davenport
Masonrywas chosen forthe North
Quad project before Felty's death.
She also said Davenport was not
directly vetted by the University
for either project because in both
cases Davenport was acting as a
subcontractor.
The University never direct-
ly screens sub-contractors, but
Architecture, Engineering and
Construction does perform a "full

pre-qualification" for construction
managers that includes scrutiny of
the firm's hiring process for sub-
contractors.
"That's one of the criteria that
we look at," Roelofs said.
Swedish construction company
Skanska was the construction man-
ager for the UMMA project.
Davenport Masonry, based in
Holt, Mich., lists an extensive port-
folio of projects for various colleges
and universities, religious facilities
and office buildings on its website.
Among these are many University
structures, including the Replace-
ment Hospital Enclosure, the Bio-
medical Science Research Building,
the Ambulatory and the School
of Public Health. Davenport also
worked on the Michigan Theatre
on State Street.
Most recently, the company was
tapped to help construct the new
$175 million North Quad residen-
tial and academic complex located
at 105S. State St. To ensure safety at
this new site, MIOSHA performed

standard planned inspections this
pasi May and July.
"We have done two inspections
and they have both been clean,"
Pawlowski said. "We want to see
firms being more diligent about
adhering to our standards, espe-
cially after serious violations."
Though the willful violations
against Davenport Masonry are
grounds for concern, violations
against construction companies are
more commonplace than generally
expected.
Barton Malow Co., the contrac-
tor working on C.S. Mott's Chil-
dren's and Women's Hospital and
the Michigan Stadium renovation,
has been cited for 36 violations since
2005, according to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor's website. Walbridge
Aldinger, the general contractor
working on North Quad that also
built the new Hill- Dining Center,
has had six violations levied against
them since 2005. None of the viola-
tions for either company, however,
were classified as willful.

ON DISPLAY

The school of MT&D's production of'Macbeth'
triumphs over a curse and the scope of Shakespeare

t's just coincidence,"
Philip Kerr says of the supersti-
tions that swirl around Shake-
speare's "Macbeth."
"I don't personally believe that
spirits are throwing rocks at us or
anything."
Kerr, professor of theater and
drama in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, will direct the
Department of Theatre & Drama's
performance of "Macbeth" this
weekend at the Power Center for
the Performing Arts.
It's well known in showbiz that
"Macbeth" is cursed. In one 17th-
century production, the actor
playing King Duncan was alleg-
edly murdered when a real dag-
ger was used instead of a fake one
for his stabbing scene. At least 25
people died in the Astor Place Riot
of 1849, which was spurred by a
rivalry between two well-known
actors both playing - who else -
Macbeth. And in a 1953 produc-
tion starring Charlton Heston, a
sudden gust of wind blew flames
from a realistically staged battle
scene onto Heston. He was severely
burned - as it turned out, someone
had soaked his tights in kerosene.
Kerr has been lucky so far in
this production, save a few bouts
of swine flu in the cast - still, he
insists, "touch wood and please

A talking goat who

is taking center stage
in Studio One at the

Center. "0 Lovely
Glowworm" features
a taxidermied animal
telling a story about
mermaids, toilets and
everything in between.
The play was written

Berger who adapted

cal for Broadway. The
performance is free
and starts at 8 p.m.

don't say anything."
When Kerr played the Scottish
lord Ross in the 1988 Broadway
revival of "Macbeth," it was a dif-
ferent story. That show was plagued
by changes in directors, sets and
actors, and lead Christopher Plum-
mer (known for his leading roles in
movies like "The Sound of Music"
and "Up") was injured multiple
times in multiple accidents.
There are several theories
behind the "Macbeth" curse. Some
say Shakespeare lifted some of his
lines for the "Macbeth" witches
from actual spells, causing real-
life witches to jinx the play. Oth-
ers point to King James, the ruler
for whom Shakespeare allegedly
wrote "Macbeth," who believed in
witchcraft and even wrote a book
on demonology.
Even saying the name "Mac-
beth" aloud in the theater, some
say, can lead to grave misfortune.
And so it is often referred to as
"The Scottish Play," and its lead
actors as "Mac-ers."
Depending on the theater com-
pany, 'there are certain cleansing
rituals for those who accidentally
say "Macbeth" - including one
in which the culprit turns around
three times, spits over his or her
left shoulder and recites a line from
another work of Shakespeare. In

some circles, one just has to swear.
But safe within the walls of the
Power Center, Kerr isn't afraid to
let his actors say the name.
"(The character of Macbeth) is
intriguing, but not totally sympa-
thetic, and that may contribute to
(the superstitions)," Kerr added.
Shakespearean tragedies tend to
have flawed leads - Hamlet and
Romeo come to mind - but Mac-
beth is different, dark and at times
downright unlikable.
"I believe that Macbeth is essen-
tially a good- man whose mind is
poisoned by the witches and cor-
rupted further by his wife," coun-
ters Music, Theatre & Dance senior
Thomas Wolfson.
Wolfson might be a little biased
- he plays Macbeth - but he
doesn't see the character as "a
moustache-twisting villain." Wolf-
son will indeed sport a moustache
for the performance, though.
"Macbeth" is Shakespeare's
shortest and most violent tragedy.
It deals with dirty, primal ambi-
tion - the power couple at its cen-
ter consists of a man who considers
murdering his king but doesn't
have the guts and the heartless
wife who emasculates him so much
that he finally commits the crime.
After three witches deliver a
prophecy that he will become

king, the Scottish general Mac-
beth - upon his wife's urging and
taunting - murders King Duncan
and assumes the throne. But the
couple's bloody power trip soon
threatens the Macbeths' own san-
ity and lives.
Though the casualty count is
lower than that of "Hamlet," dam-
aged psyches and selfish motives lie
at the heart of "The Scottish Play."
"Macbeth" in Desperate Times
Kerr's investigation into the
play's themes . of "disease and
wounds and blood and light and
dark" led him to set the play not
in 11th century Scotland as Shake-
speare did, or in 1606 England
where it was written, but rather in
a World War I-era field hospital.
Though most productions
of "Macbeth" use a vaguely
"Braveheart"-like medieval Scot-
tish setting, shifting the play's time
and place isn't rare. Kerr points to a
Canadian production last summer
that set the play in revolutionary
South America.
The landscape of Kerr's "Mac-
beth" was inspired by an actual
World War I-era picture of a
bombed-out church that had been
converted into a field hospital. Kerr

High Five
A notable Ann Arborite gives five
answers to a curious question.
Mark Clague
Associate Professoi of Musicology
What are your five favorite Motown songs?
1. "Cometo Me," MaryJohnson (1959)-This is the first songBerry Gordy
wrote and recorded with the $800 loan from his family's investment fund. The
hot, dedicated microphones on the tambourine and bass singer give the listener
the feeling of being in the band. If "Come to Me" had not been a hit, Tamla /
Motown would have gone out of business before it even started.
2. "Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)," The Temptations
(1970) - While Gaye's "What's Going On" is the emblematic Motown political
song, "Ball of Confusion" is earlier and hits topics such as the Vietnam War,
racial segregation, white flight, drug abuse and political corruption with a funk
bass line that drives the whole message home.
3. "Dancing in the Street," Martha and the Vandellas (1964) - Before Diana
Ross, Martha Reeves was the original female lead of a hit Motownvocal trio.
"Dancing in the Street" helped define the "Motown sound," and captures the
positive, worldwide message of friendship and brotherhood for which the label
is justly famous.
4. "ABC," The Jackson 5 (1970) - The supergroup's second hit of five in a row,
"ABC" features the passion, power, and joy in the voice of 10-year-old Michael.
It's an infectious song and maybe more than any tune, suggests that everyone
loves Motown.
5. "Superstition," Stevie Wonder (1972) - Stevie won artistic independence
from the corporation and asa result remains the one artist of the classic era who
remained loyal to the label. The electric groove (played by Wonder on clavinet -
an early electric keyboard) and power-pop horn lines can't be beat.
SINGLE REVIEW
BEACH HOUSE
"ZEBRA"
Beach House has been steadily making a name for itself with its narcotic dream
pop, and "Zebra," the leadoff track to the band's Sub Pop debut Teen Drean, finds
the Baltimore duo setting their ambitions ever higher. But despite the track's thick-
er arrangements and quicker pace, the band retains its praise-worthy knack for
winning melodies and minimalist arrangements. The band's ode to the "black and
white horse" is a shimmering display of'slow, hand-plucked guitar and woozy vin-
tage organs, anchored by lead singer Victoria Legrand's smoky and intoxicating
vocals.

Seeking refuge
at Seva

"Book of Iterations" features three horse skulls, earned Aphasia, Anomia and Alexia.

Written on the bones

Using dioramas and tattooed horse skeletons,
South African artist Pippa Skotnes challenges
the definition of a book
By Leah Burgin I Daily Arts Writer

"It's one of those awful questions
where people
say 'what kind Book of
of work do you
make?"' u Iterons
For Pippa Through
Skotnes, artist Jan.22
and professor of At Institute of the
fine art at Univer- Humanities Gallery
sity of Cape Town
in South Africa, the answer to her
own hypothetical question is com-
plex. Her current exhibition, "Book
of Iterations," explores the defini-
tion ofa book through the mediums
of shadow box (an enclosed diora-
ma) and - believe it or not - tat-
tooed horse skeletons.
Skotnes's interest in books began
with legal, as opposed to artistic,
inspiration.
"I'm really interested in what a
book is," she said. "Part ofthat inter-
est comes out of a court case where
I made a book that I considered an
artwork and the National Library in
South Africa claimed that their legal
department should be able to copy
the book. They wanted a precedent
out of this and sued me."
The court case centered on the
definition of a book. Ultimately,
an appeals court ruled against
Skotnes, saying that books and art-
work are mutually exclusive.
"So then I thought about it after-
wards. About what, in terms of the
law, is a book? And what could I
make that would fit the legal defi-
nition of a book, yet the library
wouldn't claim it?" she added.
To create such an object, Skotnes
turned to horse skeletons and shad-
ow boxes. On three of the exhibit's
walls hang conglomerates of boxes
containing dioramas consisting of,
among other items, a leopard skel-
eton, crane skulls, horse shoe nails,
miniature World War I stretch-
ers, photographs of colleagues and
family members dressed as clergy
members, text excerpts and pho-
tographs of now-dead Westernized
Bushmen.
According to Skotnes, the
shadow boxes are supposed to be
unbound pages of a multi-cultural
and time-defying narrative dis-
cussing two of Skotnes's themes:
redemption and sacrifice.
The solitary horse skeleton at
the exhibit's center also comments
on these themes. Named the Book
of Divine Cancellation, this skel-.
eton is tattooed with fragments of
John Donne's poetry on its skull,
King Hamlet's ghost's speech about
purgatory upon its hips, passages
from religious works upon its ribs
and legs and major battles of World
War I along its spine. Noteworthy
battles of World War II are written
on linen strips and attached to the
rear of the horse, forming a tail.
Even though Skotnes cannot
remember why she chose to use
horse bones for the exhibit, it seems
fitting now.
"The skeletons fit the legal defi-
nition of a book - they have spines,
pages - which don't have to be
made out of paper - and writing,"
she said.
The Book of Divine Cancella-
tion is joined by three bridled horse
skulls and the remains of one of its
complete skeleton brother books
(there are four in total) that was
accidentally destroyed in transit
to the exhibit. Fragments of the
damaged skeleton are on display,
featuring excerpts from 19th-cen-
tury interviews with South African

Bushmen.
These interviews were combined
into an archive of the now-dead
Bushmen language, called Ixam
(pronounced with a tut, followed
by "sahn"). Fourteen-thousand
pages of interviews and several
photographs are all that remain of
this extinct culture. The passages
featured on the broken skeleton,
centered on stories of transforma-
tion, are just small selections from
the archive.
Though unplanned, the wrecked
horse fits perfectly into the exhibit.
As Skotnes explained, "it's a frag-
mentary object representing a frag-
mentary archive."
The three horse skulls, named
Aphasia ("without memory"), Ano-
mia ("the loss of names") and Alex-
ia ("the inability to write"), also
represent this theme of fragments,
as each horse stands for an aspect
of incompleteness.
"Aphasia represents the martyrs
burnt at the stake during the Mid-
dle Ages. Anmia represents war
casualties and the soldiers who not
only sacrificed their lives, but also
sacrificed their names. And Alex-
ia represents the paradox of the
remaining Ixam dictionary - it is a
written document meant to decode
an oral language that is no longer
spoken and only exists in writing,"
Skotnes said.
The skulls, skeleton fragments
and complete horse glisten with
gold leaf that complements the
vibrant red and stark black ink used
to tattoo the bone. While these col-
ors are aesthetically pleasing, their
combination and resulting beauty
are eerie. Instead of masking what
the dead horses are supposed to
represent, the delicate artistic
touches highlight the skeletons'
otherworldliness.
This ghostly aura is exactly what
Skotnes was tryingto express.
"How do you represent a lost
world? A lost culture? A lost lan-
guage? I chose the idea of sacrifice
- Christ and other biblical stories,
the colonists wiping out civiliza-
tions of Bushmen, World WartI sol-
diers slaughtered in the trenches,
the four horsemen of the apoca-
lypse," she said.
"Where is the redemption? I
think it's in finding some kind of
voice for the dead - providing a
way for these texts to walk out of
the archive on the bones of hors-
es. Making their absence present
through the sensorial."
A quote painted onto one of
the exhibit's walls (from Robert
Pogue Harrison's "Dominion of the
Dead") further explores this con-
cept:
"The Dead speak from beyond
the grave as long as we lend them
the means of locution; they take up
their abode in books, dreams, hous-
es, portraits, legends, monuments
and graces as long as we keep open
the places of their indwelling."
In addition to themes of sacri-
fice and redemption, Skotnes is
also interested in "how objects
circulate and move away from
their original place into differ-
ent realms and spaces." This
concept manifests itself in the
exhibit through miniature vials
spread throughout the dioramas
and skeletons, containing one
line each from an essay by Ste-
phen Greenblatt on the nature of
the rucharist. Skotnes's curlsity
alsomirrors the dispersive nature

Quite literally, I can say
that every Saturday

or if there
was four feet of snow on the
ground. It was a ritual.
The routinization of these
pilgrimages to Seva began out
of circumstance. As most dorm
dwellers know, residence hall
cafeterias are closed on Saturday
nights. So, ravenous, my three
friends and I would drag our-
selves out of the building - a dif-
ficult task on those winter days
when the heat was cranked up
so high that shorts and t-shirts
could be worn comfortably inside
- and trudge across the Diag.
A little relief from East
Quad's world harvest bar and
limited cereal selection was
appreciated - 10 blocks of bit-
ing Michigan wind was not.
But, alas, it was worth it every
time. Seeing Seva, with its
great big leafy sign sitting atop
the Ann Arbor Comedy club, is
from the first moment a whim-
sical experience.
Stepping through the double-
door threshold is like stumbling
back onto the set of my high
school's production of "Peter
Pan." The fairy lights, wood-
paneled walls and pearlescent
green flooring could have easily
been used in any scene from that
play. The main dining area is
spacious and rectangular, recall-
ing the image of an all-purpose
room, readily convertible for
the big dance or school-wide
assembly. From the orange lava
lamp sitting unapologetically on
the bar behind the hostess stand
to the arbitrary placement of
stained-glass artwork and hang-
ing plants throughout the res-
taurant, it's obvious that Seva,
like the lostboys, doesn't want to
grow up. And I love that.
I am a stalwart defender of
the place, not because the food
is outrageously gourmet or the
service dazzling - in fact neither
are. What makes Seva great is
its warm and friendly ambi-
ence, commitment to delicious
and affordable vegetarian and
vegan cuisine and overall funky
vibe. It is one of the few spots in
Ann Arbor where families, hip-
pies and frat boys seem to come
together to have a good meal.
The menu, creative but con-
stant, will distract you with its
overabundance of options. If
you like going out to eat with a
biggroup of indecisive pals like
I do, it may take awhile to order.
Seva's yam fries, accompanied by

a spicy mayo dipping sauce, are
" necessary supplement to any
entr6e or the perfect appetizer
if you're having trouble decid-
ing on what to do for the main
course.
Back when I first became a
vegetarian, Seva was ahaven for
me. Instead of the usual dearth
of options'I encountered atlmost
places, I could eat everything on
the menu. When I was vegan this
was even more of a blessing. But,
Seva isn'tjust a good vegetarian
place. It's a good restaurant in
general. Its ambience is light-
hearted and fun - the perfect
finale for ahard week. Moderate
prices and generous portions
make ita student and family
favorite.
Seva doesn't try to compen-
sate for its meatless-ness by
being overly flashy or haughty.
The food is comforting and
it's a great place to experiment
with dishes you might not get to
try anywhere else. Probe their

Seva (not to be confused with
Sava's, another spot down the
street and around the corner) has
a full bar, both a gluten-free and
a kids' menu and serves breakfast
all day. In other words, there's
something for everyone. Some say
that Seva lacks innovation - the

that's OK. Sevsshouldbe allowed

are closely tied with my friends.
So far away from home, it has
become a college family spot.

I can count to celebrate every-
thing from birthdays to goings-
away, losses and triumphs. I
never left unsatisfied. And the

to the next day with leftovers.

of her own work.
"I started working with the
archive in the 1980s and it's a proj-
ect I've been working on for so long
that every time I think I'm going
to give it up, something comes out
of the woodwork. In the past, the
pieces have traveled everywhere
around the world," she said.
This time the exhibit brought
with it two events - a lecture
by Skotnes titled "Curating the
Archive: Representing Scattered
Collections of the Colonial Past" at
the UMMA last Wednesday and a
conference with multiple scholars
discussing the "Archive, Museum,
and the Safe House of Language"
at the Humanities Gallery last
Thursday.
In her lecture, Skotnes focused
on a Bushmen diorama that was
closed down in South Africa due
to its culturally insensitive nature.
Skotnes discussed the merits of the
exhibit (which was, incidentally,
not opposed by those whom it was
"insensitively" presenting).
She claimed the diorama, fea-
turing several Bushmen in their
hunting camp, paused and looking
toward an animal that just ran past,
encourages a suspension of disbe-
lief. Representing a snapshot of
an extinct existence, the diorama
seems more real simply because
it is a fantasy. Even though the
potential of this moment's reality
is gone forever, the remembrance
remains in this diorama.
Despite the heavy subject mat-
ter of her exhibit and lecture,
Skotnes offered a message of hope
for the future of her two passions:
the archive and the book.
"One increasingly goes online.
and finds more fabulous, old
archives digitized. But then what
happens to the actual archive? It's
no longer of interest just in terms
of content, yet it's still interest-
ing," she said.
"In the books that I've pub-
lished I've tried to put the reader
in the presence of the actual
objects because when you work
with the archive and work with
the material, you become bonded
with the documents - with the
paper, the ink, the srpell of it. Digi-
tizing an archive makes the mate-

rial more important. And it's the
same for a book."
"I think there's an entangle-
ment in the object and the read-
ing, which the digital availability
of it will throw into sharper relief.
Books and archives allow you to
occupy a space that other disci-
plines don't allow you to occupy,"
she added.
In an interesting twist,
Skotnes's obsession with the con-
cepts of books and archives direct-
ly affects a visitor's experience of
the exhibit. Beside a single plaque
outlining her credentials and gen-
eral influences, no other explicitly
explanatory text is prominently
displayed in the exhibit. Skotness
intends her work to be ambigu-
ous and to instill a unique reaction
within each visitor.
According to Skotnes, her art-
work should be read as a book - a
highly interpretive narrative can
be gleaned from the bones, pho-
tographs and other materials in
the exhibit. However, a copy of
the exhibit's corresponding (and
traditional) book, "Book of Itera-
tions," is available ifa visitor needs
footnotes.

MACBETH
From Page lB
and the design crew took pains
to create a set and costumes that
would be historically accurate
but not so specific as to take away
from the play's universal themes.
More than anything, the setting is
a metaphor for the characters' psy-
chological damage.
"It might have been a church,
but now it's a hospital," Kerr says
of his setting, "So there's a sense
of transformation and decay, and
yet curative hope, going on all at
once."
"Dingy" and "decrepit" are two
words costume director Rachel
Jahn, a senior design and produc-
tion major in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, used to describe
Kerr's rendering. The set and
costume designs reflect a color-
less, broken world. The attention
to detail is impressive, from the
nostalgic black-and-white fam-
ily photos taped above a cot to the
eerie brown gas masks that Jahn
constructed from authentic peri-
od-era masks and store-bought
canvas.
"We wanted there to be a sense
of history, and there's a lot of
things that are happening here ...
that you don't necessarily see, that
you don't necessarily know about,"
Jahn says.
Mystery and mysticism, the
things "you don't see," are essen-
tial to the design of Macbeth. The
"Macbeth" witches (of "Double,
double toil and trouble" fame)
appear twice in the play to proph-
esize, as well as'inspire, the action.

For this production, Kerr chose
to portray the witches as nuns.
According to Jahn, this was the
most controversial costume deci-
sion. To lessen the controversy,
the witches lower a black veil that
rids them of their nun-ness and
turns them into a "non-entity"
before they utter their lines.
"We found all these different
'roles' for everyone to play inside
this world," Jahn explains.
Her costumes paint Macbeth as
a fighter pilot, wife Lady Macbeth
as a nurse and enemy Macduff as a
military surgeon.
Jahn spent her summer vaca-
tion mining Google Images and
library books for historical tid-
bits to use in the production - for
instance, the early 20th century
was full of facial hair, so many of
the male actors have grown beards
for the performance.
Obviously, blood is a major
component of "Macbeth" as well.
While the exact recipe is a secret
of the trade, Jahn mentioned Her-
shey's syrup as a possible ingre-
dient. The blood in "Macbeth" is
mostly what Jahn describes as
"old blood," dripping from dag-
gers or red-stained hands. Even
though Jahn calls her blood more
"minimal" and "graphic" than the
blood in some other productions,
it's still a concern when the ward-
robe crew does laundry between
shows.
The set remains the same
throughout all five acts of "Mac-
beth." Institutional gray cots
are lined up in a room that looks
grungy but seems to retain some
former glory with artful pillars
and arches arranged in the back-

ground.
Set designer Vincent Moun-
tain, associate professor of design
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, brings out the humanity
in "Macbeth" in the little things:
bland grey clothes hanging on a
line, crutches haphazardly strewn
beside a hospital bed.
But none of Mountain's set
designs are present in the produc-
tion's minute-long trailer, which
readers can find on YouTube. Min-
imalist and abstract, it interposes
World War I photo footage with a
scene of Lady Macbeth symboli-
cally baptizing her husband in a
tub of blood. He emerges brutal
and forceful, a transformation
that occurs near the beginning of
"Macbeth."
An Ensemble Production
Wolfson's Macbeth will be
joined by Music, Theatre & Dance
junior Anna Robinson as Lady
Macbeth, along with a supporting
cast made up of mostly upperclass-
men, with one first-year Music,
Theatre & Dance student, David
Kaplinsky, who plays James.
"The director trusts you to be
self-motivated ... and allows you
the space to try new things in the
rehearsal process," Kaplinsky says
of his first college-level perfor-
mance.
When the production was
found to be lacking in "males of
size," Kerr found two Michigan
football players to round out the
cast. Both in the College of Liter-
ate, Science and the Arts, fifth-
year senior and starting offensive
lineman David Moosman and

senior quarterback David Cone
portray soldiers. Also unaffiliated
with the School of Music,'Theatre
& Dance, a 12-year-old Tappan
Middle School student will play
Little Macduff.
About 60 students auditioned
for the 29 roles in Macbeth, with
preference given to acting BFA
undergraduates. These BFA stu-
dents are required to audition

music, and actors have to find the
right cadence to make lines reso-
nate that might sound stilted to
modern-day speakers of English.
Kerr's actors don't use British
accents, which he thinks would
narrow down the play by speci-
fying the time and place of the
action. Instead, they focus on clear,
diction to bring the lines across to
audiences.

Macbeth is essentially a
good man whose mind is
corrupted byhis wife.
- Thomas Wolfson, performer

Kerr sees as much of a psycho-
logical study as a linear progres-
sion in "Macbeth." What makes
"Macbeth" stand out are the snap-
shots of a fanatical Macbeth rant-
ing to a ghost as he hosts a dinner
party or a guilty Lady Macbeth
trying and trying to wash the
blood off her hands.
And it's these psychological
details that will be emphasized
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance's production to bring across
central themes of ambition, fate
and the supernatural.
Large themes require a large
space, and so, of this year's main-
stage plays, "Macbeth" is the only
one to take the stage at the 1,380-
seat Power Center for the Per-
forming Arts.
"To put something on in the
Power Center, it needs to have
size," Kerr explains, "and a Shake-
speare play ... usually has size to
it - it's dealing with big ideas, big
themes."
But there's still room for the
audience to add its own interpre-
tation to Kerr's sparse presenta-
tion of a bleak world.
"I think that's one of the things
theater can do ... (it's) not spelling
out all the details for the audience,
you have to work too. It's a little
different from watching a film on a
small screen in your living room,"
Kerr says.
At only $9 for students, it's not
much of a price difference, either.
Provided no sudden stroke of bad
luck hits before 7:30 p.m. tonight,
the University's production of
"Macbeth" promises a journey to a
traumatized world where "Fair is
foul and foul is fair."

for all mainstage productions
and must fulfill a "studio cred-
it" requirement by performing
onstage. This can be accomplished
through School of Music, Theatre
& Dance productions like "Mac-
beth," or in student-run shows
with Basement Arts or other orga-
nizations.
Throughout the school year, the
Department of Theatre & Drama
produces five mainstage plays.
Shakespearean works are more
rare, though, the last one being
"As You Like It," performed last
spring.
One major difficulty in per-
forming Shakespeare is the lan-
guage. Delivering Shakespearean
lines is comparable to performing

Making Shakespeare clear is no
easy task - scores of high school
English classes have spent hours
puzzled over lines like "Things
bad begun make strong them-
selves by ill" (Act III, Scene II).
But in a live production, an actor's
delivery and facial expression can
make a big difference in the way
lines are interpreted.
Sometimes, directors with
a more modern take on Shake-
speare will change the script to
incorporate contemporary lan-
guage, but the only changes Kerr
has made to the original script are
a few cuts to make the action flow
more quickly.
"Shakespeare wrote scenes, not
plays," Kerr theorizes.

writing? Absolutely.
We all know that correlation does not
imply causation. And with a test group size
of only 300, I can't help but be a little skep-
tical. But then I read the abstract. While
the psychological jargon reassured me that
that study was somewhat legitimate, I still
felt pretty defensive until the last sentence:
"Results provide new evidence for both

compensatory and complementary uses and
gratifications of entertainment media."
Now, I didn't read the actual research
paper (I decidedly refused to pay the $25
fee for access to the paper for a mere day.
Seriously, paying for access to a University
study? "That's the Michigan difference."),
but it sounds as though the study wasn't
designed to insult me and other TV lovers.
Shocking, I know. Watching television for
"compensatory and complementary uses"
probably isn't the healthiest way to fill the
void, but I'm sure we can all think of worse
things lonely people could do with their

time. And if it makes them feel better, who's
to say relating to a TV character is a bad
thing at all?
We all remember pretending to be Power
Rangers as kids. And while my particular
group of childhood playmates spent most of
the time arguing over who got to be which
color, there was always that one group of
kids that had it all figured it out. They didn't
just pretend to be Power Rangers, they were
Power Rangers. Maybe they were a little
weird, and maybe they were mocked, but
who were we to tell them they weren't actu-
ally Jason, Kimberly, Zack, Billy, Tommy

and Trini? While my fun was at a standstill
until little Robby sucked it up and accepted
that he was stuck as the Blue Ranger, they
were off enjoying themselves. Long story
short, the point is, even if they were identify-
ing with these characters because they were
lonely (and they probably weren't), they
were having a good time.
Having a good time - or, the "gratifica-
tions of entertainment media" - is what
decent television should be about. And if this
studyhas anylastingmerit,maybethe indus-
try will realize its power and takeit to heart.
If lonely people are relating closely to TV

characters, maybe watching their pseudo-
friends struggle and triumph would instill in
them a sense of hope. I'm notsaying we need
more programming like "Full House," but
watching my forlorn BFF Artie come out on
top every once in a while couldn't hurt and
would certainly make me happier.
In the end, who really cares if people are
relating to TV because they're lonely? First-
rate work is being appreciated, and people in
need of comfort are finding it. Besides, I'm
sure original Blue Ranger, Billy Cranston,
was a much better friend than little Robby
anyway.

'THE PAGEMASTER' (1994)
Growing up animated


By HANS YADAV like co
Daily Arts Writer lights a
off into

When reminiscing about our
childhoods, we more often than
not focus on the good memories
- the playing, the laughing and
the lack of responsibility. It's easy,
though, to forget those repressed
moments of terror in the night or
being alienated by peers and bul-
lies. Ultimately, in order to grow
out of childhood, we must at some
point dive headfirst into our fears
and conquer them.
"The Pagemaster" is a story
about a boy named Richard
(Macaulay Culkin, "Saved!") who
is scared of everything. His par-
ents are at their wits' end trying
to get him to take any risks in life.
Richard's dad even builds him
a tree house, but when asked to
come up and check it out, Richard
just gives a barrage of statistics on
the number of household-related
accidents.
Finally, Richard's dad sends
him to buy some nails for the tree
house, and though Richard isn't
happy about venturing into the
world alone, he goes begrudgingly.

allusions, irony and metaphors.
The allusions come in the form of
the various storybook characters
Richard encounters as part of the
central plot, but there are more
subtle ones incorporated as well,
like the raven from Edgar Allen
Poe's classic poem. The instances
of irony will escape most children
(like when one talking book criti-
cizes another book for not hav-
ing a spine), but at least the most
important message - and conse-
quently the central metaphor of
the movie - remains accessible to
all age groups. The obstacles Rich-

ror those insurmountable hurdles
found in the real world.
Whether Richard actually
entered the cartoon world or if
he dreamt everything up remains
largely ambiguous. But on his ride
back home at the end of the film, he
sees the ramp he knew before he
would never able to clear and, sud-
denly, he is peddling toward it at
full speed - with a grin on his face.
