CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Discussions, panels 
kick off week-long 
symposium on race 
and social justice

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Instead of attending classes 

Monday, 
University 
students 

and faculty honored the legacy of 
Martin Luther King Jr. by host-

ing or attending various semi-
nars and discussions to examine 
social justice in American soci-
ety.

The School of Social Work 

hosted “Policing Black Bodies: 
A Dialogue on Poverty, Police 
Brutality and the Way Out” to 
reflect on King’s legacy in mod-
ern America. Writer Shaun Ossei 
Owusu, Assistant Prof. Kamau 
Rashid and Rackham student 
Finn Bell discussed how poverty, 
race and police brutality have 
changed throughout U.S. his-

tory.

“The 
historical 
configura-

tions of race in the United States, 
within the context of slavery and 
colonialism, actually teaches us 
a great deal about the contempo-
rary manifestations and expres-
sions of racism today,” Rashid 
said. “Racism is both permanent 
and indestructible and I think 
that there’s a lot that we can 
learn from this.”

Rackham 
student 
Loren 

Cahill, who is in the School of 
Social Work, said the most nota-

ble part of the event was Rashid’s 
acknowledgement of racism’s 
permanency and inability to 
completely dissolve.

“I thought it was phenom-

enal,” she said. “I liked the dis-
cussion about still fighting to do 
racial work and to end profiling, 
still striving to improve it.

Bell spoke of his experience 

growing up white in the South 
and witnessing the racial dis-
crimination his peers through 
an outside lens. He also warned

CAMPUS LIFE

Efforts to move 

multicultural center, 

increase minority 
enrollment continue

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

On a cold Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Day last year, members of the Uni-
versity’s Black Student Union stood 
atop the steps of Hill Auditorium, 
holding black signs etched with 
white chalk. The organization gath-
ered to protest stagnant minority 
enrollment and demand the Univer-
sity meet seven goals for improving 
campus climate.

Engineering 
senior 
Robert 

Greenfield, BSU treasurer, said in 
early discussions, administrators 
expressed a genuine willingness to 
collaborate with the BSU. 

“University 
administration 
is 

made of the highest and best ser-
vants of our University, and the BSU 
is very appreciative of how they 
have collaborated with us,” he said. 
“However, as of now, it is the overall 
sentiment of the BSU that progress 
is not being made, and as an execu-

tive board, we’re questioning the 
administration’s willingness due to 
how fast things are progressing.” 

Despite progress on several of 

the BSU’s demands, which includ-
ed revising the Race and Ethnic-
ity distribution requirement and 
providing emergency funding for 
students, Greenfield said he and 
other members of the BSU believe 
progress slowed over the last year, 
particularly in increasing minority 
enrollment and establishing a new 
multicultural center on Central 
Campus.

“It’s been a year, and many of the 

things that still need to be done, the 
Black Student Union just can’t con-
trol,” he said. “Many of the solutions 
to the demands have been handed 
over to people who are very pas-
sionate about fulfilling the work, but 
just simply don’t have the resources 
to do so.”

In November 2013, the BSU had 

launched the Twitter initiative 
#BBUM. Students of color used the 
hashtag, which stands for Being 
Black at the University of Michigan, 
to share thoughts and experiences 
about being a minority on campus. 
#BBUM soon went viral, accumu-
lating over 10,000 tweets by 10 p.m. 

MEN’S BASKETBALL

With much of its 
roster depleted, 
Michigan faces an 

uphill battle

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

John Beilein was frank in 

assessing the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s roster prior to 
its Tuesday night tilt with Rut-
gers in Piscataway.

“We have more injured or sick 

players than we have healthy 
players right now,” Beilein said.

The Wolverines’ eighth-year 

coach is barely exaggerating. As 
few as six players are entirely 
healthy and ready to contribute 
major minutes against a Rutgers 
team that upset then-No. 4 Wis-
consin on Jan. 11, and the rest of 
Michigan’s roster is hurt, sick, 
ineligible or some combination 
thereof.

Following 
the 
team’s 

announcement 
Sunday 
that 

junior guard Caris LeVert is out 
for the remainder of the season 
with a left foot injury, the Wol-
verines’ injury tally stands at 
four. Freshman forward D.J. Wil-
son may redshirt and has yet to 
be cleared for full-court play fol-
lowing a December knee sprain. 
Freshman 
forward 
Kameron 

Chatman is questionable thanks 
to a knee injury suffered Satur-
day against Northwestern. And 
sophomore guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. remains limited by an injured 
toe on his right foot which has 
plagued him throughout the year.

To make matters worse, fresh-

man forward Ricky Doyle’s status 
is uncertain thanks to an illness, 
and junior guard Spike Albrecht 
is questionable because of an 
upper respiratory infection.

Per Beilein, Albrecht has been 

“cleared to give it a shot and see 
how he feels.”

That leaves just nine healthy 

players. But sophomore guard 
Andrew Dakich hasn’t played this 
season, and likely won’t — Beilein 
has said previously that Dakich 
will redshirt so that he has a 
fifth year of eligibility remain-
ing should he choose to transfer. 
Duncan Robinson is also sitting 
out the season, because NCAA 
transfer policy precludes him 
from playing in the year follow-
ing his move to Ann Arbor from 
Division III Williams College. 
But Robinson wouldn’t have been 
available, anyway — he suffered a 
sprained ankle in recent weeks, 
preventing him from contribut-
ing to the scout team during prac-
tice.

The injuries have depleted the 

scout team and forced to Beilein 
took advantage of an NCAA rule 
that allows coaches to occasional-
ly bring in former players to prac-
tice with the team. He invited 
David Merritt, a former Michigan 
point guard and 2009 graduate, 
to ensure that 5-on-5 competition 
was an option in practice.

Fifth annual 
MHacks event 
engages students 

over 36 hours

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

When the clock struck mid-

night on Friday, 1,200 people 
rushed to begin 36 hours of liv-
ing and breathing one thing: 
programming.

Over the weekend, MHacks, 

a hackathon competition orga-
nized by University students, 
held its fifth hacking competi-
tion.

Saturday morning, 11 hours 

into the competition, teams 

filed into the nooks and cran-
nies of the Bob and Betty 
Beyster building on North 
Campus to work on their proj-
ects. Rooms called “hacking 
spaces,” labeled with famous 
programmers such as Alan 
Turing, were filled to the brim 
with teams.

Throughout the event, some 

hackers wore pajamas, others 
remained in the clothes they 
had arrived in. A few partici-
pants slept on benches outside 
of rooms or at their desks as the 
night wore on. Several sleeping 
bags were scattered in the hall-
ways and on the floors, but a 
few resisted sleep through the 
entirety of the event.

“There 
are 
people 
who 

haven’t gone to sleep yet from 
the (organizing) team,” said 

MHacks Director John Zwick, 
an Engineering junior. “And I 
really appreciate that.”

Started in 2013 by MPow-

ered, a student organization 
that encourages entrepreneur-
ship among college students, 
MHacks promotes program-
ming innovation and encour-
ages students to build both 
software and hardware they 
can continue to develop in the 
future.

The closing ceremony of 

MHacks was held at Rack-
ham Auditorium where fam-
ily members and observers sat 
patiently for the top 10 teams 
to present the fruits of their 
labors.

After 
each 
presentation, 

Zwick read off special prizes 

ADMINISTRATION

Envoy to include 
meetings with 
several partner 

institutions

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

In his first international trip 

as the University’s chief adminis-
trator, University President Mark 
Schlissel will head to China early 
this July to continue collabora-
tion with the country’s universi-
ties, as well as to meet alumni, 
faculty and students studying 
abroad.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily on Friday, Schlis-
sel said the visit — slated for the 
week of July 5 — is demonstrative 
of the University’s growing pres-
ence in China.

“Michigan is a global univer-

sity, and I think in the decades 
ahead more so,” he said. “The 
world is becoming smaller, peo-
ple are traveling and communi-
cating with one another, students 
are traveling the globe, so reach-
ing out around the world is an 
important part of my job.”

Schlissel visit Shanghai Jiao 

Tong University and Peking Uni-
versity. Fifty University under-
graduates currently attend SJTU 
each summer through the UM-
SJTU Joint Institute to study

Research shows 

composer’s cardiac 
arrhythmia mirrors 
tempo, key changes

BY MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Fans of Ludwig van Beethoven 

may find his compositions heart-
felt, but their sentiments may be 
more accurate than they realize.

An essay published in Perspec-

tives in Biology and Medicine by 
Musicology Prof. Steven M. Whit-
ing; Dr. Joel Howell, professor of 
history of medicine and Dr. Zach-
ary D. Goldberger, cardiologist 
at the University of Washington 
School of Medicine, suggests that 
Beethoven’s music may have been 
influenced by his own heartbeat.

The 
essay 
examines 
the 

unusual rhythms found in some 
of 
Beethoven’s 
most 
famous 

compositions — such as sudden 

key changes or tempo changes 
— and speculates these irregular 
rhythms may mimic the arrhyth-
mic rhythms of Beethoven’s own 
heart.

Whiting said the idea for the 

essay emerged out of interdisci-
plinary curiosity.

“It started because of two 

musically-inclined doctors and a 
musically-inclined musicologist 
who wondered together whether 
this visceral connection to his 
own heartbeat might add yet 
another dimension to Beethoven’s 
music,” he said.

The group studied the rhyth-

mic patterns of several composi-
tions of Beethoven, focusing in 
particular on passages that were 
both emotionally stimulating and 
rhythmically irregular.

These 
irregularities 
were 

striking, the authors wrote. 
Whiting said they compared 
electrocardiograms, 
which 

measure electrical activity of 
the heart, with the music. They 

concluded that Beethoven’s own 
cardiac arrhythmia, a condition 
that causes the heart to beat with 
an irregular rhythm, may have 
influenced some of the rhythms.

Beethoven has been linked 

with a host of other health 
problems as well, such as liver 
disease, kidney disease and deaf-
ness.

His deafness, the authors 

wrote in the essay, could have 
also contributed to a heightened 
sense of awareness of his own 
heartbeat.

“If you were to sit in silence for 

a while, you would become more 
aware of your heartbeat,” How-
ell said. “Beethoven’s world was 
silent.”

One of the passages studied, 

“Cavatina,” is a movement in 
Beethoven’s String Quartet in 
B-flat Major, Opus 130. It is the 
slow movement in the quartet 
and has been long recognized as 
exhibiting overwhelming emo-
tional force. In the passage, the 
lower strings throb slow repeat-
ing notes, while the first violin is 
rhythmically unhinged from the 
lower voices.

“The passage is almost too 

distraught to align with them 
rhythmically,” Whiting said.

The emotion in the passage is 

deliberate. In fact, in the com-
poser direction written for this 
passage is the word “beklemmt,” 
a German word that could be 
taken to mean “heavy of heart.” 
The phrase “heavy of heart” may 
not only refer to a psychologi-
cal emotion, the authors wrote. 
It could also be referring to the 
pressure felt on the heart that is 
associated with cardiac arrhyth-
mia.

“We talk about music being 

heartfelt, and it is interesting 
because in some cases, music 
might be literally heartfelt,” 
Howell said. “Music might liter-
ally reflect how your heart feels. 
Your heart beats continuously 
your entire life. That’s pretty 
amazing. You’re intimately relat-
ed to your heartbeat, so it’s not 
surprising that it might make its 
way into great artists’ works.”

‘U’ professors say Beethoven’s 
heartbeat influenced his music

Keynote speaker 

encourages 

listening, unity in 

today’s society

BY LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

Kicking 
off 
the 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. Symposium, 
Marc Lamont Hill, host of 
HuffPost Live and BET News, 
delivered a keynote lecture 
to a full Hill Auditorium on 
Monday morning.

Hill spoke on King’s life 

and legacy in the context of 
current social conditions in 
the United States.

“Today, January 2015, pres-

ents a particularly interest-
ing and compelling moment 
to think through: Dr. Martin 
Luther King’s life and legacy 
at a moment when his life 
and legacy has been hijacked 
by all sides, at a time where 
he has been transformed or 
reduced into a sort of revo-
lutionary 
or 
multicultural 

action figure,” Hill said.

Hill described the present 

time in history as particular-
ly interesting and compelling 
when the legacy of King is 
compared to that of President 
Barack Obama.

“War has become an instru-

ment of foreign policy, rather 
than a last resort — this isn’t 
a motivational speech, clear-
ly. But this is our reality as 
we enter this moment. What 
would King say about this?”

Hill said King’s idea of rad-

ical listening, a practice Hill 
sees as absent from a cur-
rent age defined by “preoc-
cupation with the self,” could 
“usher in a new possibility of 
justice.”

“The legacy of King would 

say we need to listen to more 
people, we need to listen for 
poor people,” he said. “We 
can’t just be compassionate by 
proxy — poor people need to 
be at the table.”

Hill said the U.S. is also 

missing a sense of unity and 
is inhibited by a lack of con-
versation surrounding issues 
important to others, but not 
necessarily a priority to our-
selves. For example, Hill said 
people may be more concerned 
with educational reform com-
pared to prison reform, since 
the former is an issue poten-
tially more relevant to them.

Though King would not 

have argued for unanimity or 
for everyone to work togeth-
er, Hill said King would have 
wanted everyone to take the 
first step of listening to one 
another.

To fully understand King’s 

desire for listening, Hill said, 
Americans must reconstruct 
conceptions of history.

“We remember King as the 

father of democracy and mod-
ern democracy, the patriarch 
of the Civil Rights Movement, 
the 
leader 
of 
empowered 

struggle … But the truth is 
Dr. King dies an enemy of 
the state. April 4th, 1968, 
People Magazine denies Dr. 
King’s entrance on its ‘Most 
Admired Americans’ list; the 
National Baptism Convention 
kicks King out,” he said.

Hill said recognizing this 

idea is critical for helping 
people realize what King sac-
rificed when he committed 
his life to “dangerous truth-
telling.”

The latter part of the Hill’s 

speech covered points that 
relate closely to the recent 
controversial deaths of Black 
citizens, such as Trayvon 
Martin, 
Eric 
Garner 
and 

Tamir Rice.

“We’ve been reenacting the 

same ritual of Black people 
being killed for being young, 
Black and outside,” he said. 
“Instead of talking about driv-
ing while Black all the time, 
maybe we can talk about 
patrolling while racist.”

To prevent history from 

repeating 
itself, 
Hill 
said 

Americans need a greater 

sense of unity at the commu-
nity level.

“To create a community 

that includes all of us, we need 
values of inclusion,” he said. 
“That means restorative jus-
tice must trump contributive 
justice. Justice doesn’t mean 
punishment.”

To conclude his lecture, Hill 

emphasized that for change 
to occur, citizens must make 
a plan and follow through by 
taking action.

“Dr. King said we must have 

an analysis, but we can’t suc-
cumb to, as Dr. King put it, 
the paralysis of analysis … 
What does that look like? It 
means we must act bravely. 
No one modeled brave action 
more than Martin King,” he 
said.

The crowd gave Hill a 

standing ovation at the con-
clusion of his speech.

In an e-mail interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Pub-
lic Policy junior Julie Sarne 
said Hill’s lecture inspired 
students to move beyond the 
classroom and take action.

“As students at the Uni-

versity of Michigan, we learn 
about sweeping societal injus-
tices in the past and present — 
yet so often, we stop there. Dr. 
Hill delivered a call to action, 
an imperative for us to ‘act 
bravely,’ ” Sarne said. 

“After all, Dr. King’s lega-

cy demonstrates that ‘to act 
bravely is to work in the ser-
vice of justice.’ ”

Rackham student Courtney 

McCluney, president of the 
Students of Color of Rackham, 
also wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that Hill’s call to action 
resonated with her.

“Instead 
of 
glamorizing 

the positive messages of Dr. 
King’s life, (Hill) encour-
aged us to realize that to take 
action means that not every-
one will agree with you, that 
you have to sometimes go 
against the norm, and that you 
must become a radical listener 
for change to occur.”

Ndaba Mandela explores 
African equality, future

Grandson of Nelson 
Mandela calls for 

student empowerment 

through African 

heritage

BY GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Ndbaba Mandela spoke to more 

than 500 students, faculty and com-
munity members Monday, detail-
ing his upbringing, problems that 
plague Africa today and the work he 
is doing to combat them.

Mandela, the grandson of the 

late South African President Nelson 
Mandela, was the keynote speaker 
for the 2015 William K. McInally 
Memorial Lecture, sponsored by 
the Ross School of Business and the 
Office of Academic Multicultural 
Initiatives, and held in the Blau 
Auditorium at the Business School.

He 
referenced 
Martin 
Luther 

King, Jr. several times, beginning 
and ending his lecture with excerpts 
from King’s famous “I Have a 
Dream” speech.

Mandela 
championed 
progress 

and social equality throughout his 
lecture, emphasizing the struggle of 
the African people.

“The American Dream is pervad-

ing every part of society across the 
world but we, as Africans, do not 
want the American Dream, we want 
the African Dream,” Mandela said.

He said his experiences abroad 

motivated him to form his own non-
governmental organization, Africa 
Rising, to spread awareness about 
African culture and society.

“We see ourselves creating a new 

breed of young Africans that will 
empower themselves to develop the 
continent from within, raising the 
pride and the confidence of young 
Africans,” he said. “So that when 
they travel, when they engage with 
travelers that have come to visit us, 
that they will talk about Africa with 
a certain pride and confidence.”

Africa Rising strives to educate 

and empower young Africans, con-
tribute to the development of Africa 
and spread awareness to those out-
side the continent.

The organization is currently 

working to develop a resource center 
in the small village where Mandela’s 
grandfather was raised. The center, 
which plans to house a library and 
technology center, is slated to edu-
cate African children so that they 
can compete on a global scale.

Mandela said the biggest obstacle 

South Africa faces is its lack of qual-
ity and accessible education.

“The primary barrier that we have 

in South Africa, and probably across 
the continent is skills and training,” 
he said. “We do not have the skills 
nor the information to service our 
people, hence we are always work-
ing with Europe, with China, etcet-
era, to get people with skills to come 
in to service our people.”

Mandela branched beyond Afri-

ca’s internal struggles and acknowl-
edged that the fight for racial and 
economic equality across the world 
is far from over. He called on stu-
dents to recognize the sacrifice 
needed to create social change.

“Some of us have to take pub-

lic positions, we have to sacrifice, 
guys,” he said. “That is why we 
talk about these leaders because 
they sacrificed everything, includ-
ing their own families. “My grand-
father Nelson Mandela sacrificed 
his own family to become the man 
that he became and he will tell you, 
‘If I was put in the same position I 
wouldn’t change anything, I would 
do it again.’ ”

LSA freshman Taylor Rick was 

drawn to Mandela’s platform, “The 
Power of One,” and felt a desire to 
learn more about Africa.

“People don’t know enough about 

the problems in Africa so that’s 
why I came. I’m just not informed,” 
Rick said. “It has opened my eyes to 
what I need to do and what I need 
to learn.”

physics, math and engineering. 
Likewise, 100 Chinese students 
from SJTU come to the Uni-
versity each year to complete 
degrees in the same fields.

The University has engaged 

in extensive medical research 
collaboration with Peking Uni-
versity, so Schlissel’s tour there 
will largely revolve around its 
Health Science Center in Bei-
jing, which houses the Uni-
versity’s Joint Institute for 
Translational 
and 
Clinical 

Research.

“U-M has many significant 

engagements in China, and 
this trip will allow the presi-
dent to learn more about those 
engagements firsthand, and to 

meet and build relationships 
with the leaders of our partner 
institutions,” said James Hollo-
way, vice provost for global and 
engaged education in a press 
release.

Holloway will travel to China 

with Schlissel.

University President Emerita 

Mary Sue Coleman first trav-
eled to China in 2005, three 
years 
into 
her 
presidency. 

Developing 
the 
University’s 

relationship abroad was a major 
theme of her presidency, exem-
plified by presidential trips to 
India , Ghana, South Africa and 
Brazil.

Kenneth Lieberthal, a senior 

fellow in public policy at the 
Brookings Institute and for-
mer University political science 
professor, said in January 2008 
that engaging with China was 

a way to gain a deeper under-
standing of its culture, econo-
my and global impact.

Lieberthal was part of a task-

force, commissioned by Cole-
man, to determine efforts for 
using University resources to 
help improve the University’s 
understanding of China.

Currently, China is home to 

almost 5,000 University alumni 
and 200 study abroad students.

In the 2007-2008 academic 

year, LSA’s academic theme was 
“China in the World.”

“China is going to be a major 

force in the 21st century and 
so I think it’s very important 
for our students to be exposed 
and to understand the culture 
and the politics and the current 
issues in China,” Coleman said 
in an October 2007 interview 
with the Daily.

the evening of its launch. The cre-
ation of the hashtag and the subse-
quent movement gained national 
media attention and inspired simi-
lar movements on other college 
campuses. 

Law Prof. Martha Jones, co-

director of the Law School’s Pro-
gram in Race, Law & History 
and an associate professor in the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily that 
she was not on campus when the 
movement began, but followed the 
events via social media. 

“I recall vividly setting my Twit-

ter to the hashtag, so I could keep 
up with the hashtag, and I remem-
ber seeing the photographs of all 
the postings on the posting wall,” 
she said. “Those still, to me, are 
some of the most powerful images 
of the movement.” 

As part of the Martin Luther 

King, Jr. Day demonstration, BSU 
made seven demands of the Uni-
versity administration and chal-
lenged officials to respond within 
seven days. According to the BSU 
website, the demands would give 
the group “an equal opportunity to 
make change” on campus. Shortly 
after, weekly discussions between 
the BSU and the University admin-
istration 
commenced. 
During 

these meetings, plans to address 
every demand were developed. 

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones was present during the 

weekly meetings between the BSU 
and administration. In an inter-
view with the Daily, she discussed 
some of the work that has been 
done since discussions with the 
BSU began. 

“Progress was made with every 

single one of the demands, and 
several of the demands have been 
completely rectified,” Dean Jones 
said. “For example, the Bentley 
documents have been digitized 
and stricter Race and Ethnic-
ity requirements have been imple-
mented.”

Last 
April, 
University 
offi-

cials and the BSU co-authored a 
press release outlining how each 
of the seven demands was to be 
addressed. Dean Jones referred 
the Daily to the press release when 
asked about the progress made to 
address every demand thus far. 
Among the seven, four demands 
have been completely remedied, 
she said. 

The BSU was granted $60,000, 

for funding a variety of student 
groups on campus, an increase 
from the $37,000 previously allo-
cated to the organization.

The University also approved 

Intergroup Relations courses to 
count toward the Race and Eth-
nicity distribution requirement, 
increasing the classes in credit 
value from two credits to three. 
Seven colleges within the Univer-
sity adopted IGR courses as classes 
fulfilling the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement. 

The 
administration 
also 

addressed 
emergency 
funding 

for students with financial need, 

which the BSU demanded the 
University increase. By launch-
ing a survey, the University deter-
mined that available funds had 
not been exhausted. As a result, 
several University units, including 
the Office of Student Life and Cen-
tral Student Government, created a 
central website to raise awareness 
about available emergency funding 
options for each school and college.

Lastly, officials digitized Bent-

ley Historical Library documents 
with information on the Black 
Action Movement of the 1960s. A 
long-term plan for digitizing the 
remaining documents is currently 
in development by the Bentley 
Library. 

Talks to address affordable 

housing are ongoing, though eve-
ning and weekend bus service has 
increased as of May 2014. The Dean 
of Students Office has also allocat-
ed funding for students for whom 
transportation is an issue. Discus-
sions on increasing minority enroll-
ment and building a new Trotter 
Multicultural Center on Central 
Campus are also continuing. 

Greenfield said developing a 

business and architectural plan for 
a new Trotter is difficult when the 
committee responsible for doing 
so comprises students and faculty 
who lack the resources necessary 
to move the project forward, a chal-
lenge which has impacted many of 
the proposed initiatives. 

Overall, Dean Jones said the 

initiatives implemented so far are 
helping move the University closer 
toward tangible results. 

In an interview with the Daily, 

E. Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, said it is normal to 
feel like progress is slowing down 
at this point in the planning pro-
cess.

“They have been meeting weekly 

and biweekly and doing the planning 
for the new cultural center,” she said. 
“This is more long-term work, so it’s 
going to naturally feel slower than 
actually making the decision to have 
(a new multicultural center). We’re at 
the working phase.” 

Harper also said the decision to 

allocate money for the new Trotter 
Multicultural Center lies in Uni-
versity Provost Martha Pollock’s 
office, and will be budgeted once a 
plan for the new facility is finished. 
Students and faculty are expected 
to finish planning by the end of the 
semester.

“There is no expectation for the 

students and faculty to have all 
the resources they need to actu-
ally build a new Trotter,” Harper 
said. “What we’re asking students 
and faculty to do is help with the 
planning. You don’t know what 
resources you’ll need to execute the 
plan until the plan is finished being 
made.”

The BSU and University admin-

istration agree that the demand 
for a 10-percent representation of 
Black students on campus has been 
the most difficult to address.

“By the time we received the 

demands, admissions decisions 
had already been delivered,” Jones, 
the dean of students, said. “At that 
point, we decided we needed to 
focus on yield, making phone calls 
and sending e-mails to students 

of color who had been admitted, 
really encouraging them to accept 
and enroll.” 

Dean Jones also said the admin-

istration has hired Kedra Bishop to 
serve as associate vice president for 
enrollment management to further 
address minority enrollment. 

Greenfield thinks the admis-

sions office should focus on target-
ing urban communities — where 
students tend not to apply to the 
University — to raise minority 
enrollment on campus. 

“Instead of focusing on race 

and some of the cultural back-
grounds of students, admissions 
should focus more on geography, 
and highly concentrated minority 
areas or even SES status,” he said. 
“They’re going to have to start 
considering innovative admissions 
techniques.” 

Voters in the state of Michigan 

banned the consideration of race, 
among other characteristics, in 
admissions with a 2006 ballot ini-
tiative.

Aside from continuing to col-

laborate — the administration and 
BSU are currently scheduling meet-
ings for the winter semester — both 
groups are developing future events 
and plans. The BSU is currently 
planning a leadership conference to 
help increase post-graduate oppor-
tunities for students of color. The 
BSU hopes the event will include 
professional networking events and 
speakers. Details for the conference 
are projected to be released some-
time this term. 

In December, University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel announced 

his intention to release a campus 
diversity plan and to host a lead-
ership breakfast for various com-
munity members Feb. 18 focused 
on developing a strategic plan for 
diversity at the University. 

Many agree #BBUM and the 

movement that followed had a 
significant impact on the Univer-
sity and will be remembered by the 
University community for years to 
come. 

“It definitely provoked a lot of 

listening and thought,” Prof. Jones 
said. “I was thrilled and so proud of 
our students for so creatively and 
so eloquently bringing this move-
ment not only to our campus audi-
ence, but to a national audience.” 

She also said #BBUM will serve 

as a prime example of student 
activism to which younger Wolver-
ines can aspire. 

“BBUM will be linked to a long 

chain of the history of activism on 
this campus,” she said. “It has left 
a challenge for students on this 
campus. How are you going to 
leave your mark? What do you care 
about, and what are you going to do 
about it?” 

“Be understanding and be open 

minded,” Greenfield said. “Don’t 
allow your social circle to be your 
end-all-be-all. Consider what oth-
ers have to offer.” 

Dean Jones said the work will 

continue.

“We all need to keep working 

on this together,” Dean Jones said. 
“We have to keep the momentum 
going, keep the support going, and 
keep the lines of communication 
open.”

given out by sponsors of the event. 
One of the prizes, sponsored by 
Thiel Audio Products, offered 
NetworkedIn, FoodCompass and 
Snooze You Lose, three different 
teams, $1,000 to continue devel-
oping their hacks. If the winners 
were to continue pursuing their 
projects, 
representatives 
from 

Thiel said their cash prize could 
increase to $5,000.

The top three winners, selected 

by a panel of judges, were Draw 
Anything, which placed first, 
DataWave, which placed second, 
and Haptic Feedback Suit, which 
placed third.

Rackham students Olivia Walch 

and Matt Jacobs, developers of 
Draw Anything, used Wolfram 
Alpha to program an application 
that allows an individual to snap 
a picture of any object and config-
ure a step-by-step instruction on 
how to draw it.

Walch said her MHacks vic-

tory was unexpected, particularly 
because her app was more algo-
rithm-based.

“I also love designing iOS apps, 

so that was the software part of it, 
and I just figured these awesome 
people are doing amazing hard-
ware things that I could never do,” 
Walch said. “So I thought when 
you do something more theoreti-
cal — I mean they’ve got a Nerf 
gun — we don’t have a chance.”

MHacks is the first competi-

tion of its kind in the nation and 
has inspired several other college-
based hackathons in recent years. 

Representatives from a similar 
hacking competition at Stanford 
University called TreeHacks were 
in attendance and planned to fly 
the winning team from MHacks 
to their hackathon at Stanford.

This is a common practice at 

hackathons, and MHacks prac-
tices a similar method to draw 
students, both national and inter-
national, according Zwick.

“We bring in talent from 

around the country and even out-
side of the country,” Zwick said. 
“We have people from as far as 
South Africa this time around. It’s 
a building marathon so they can 
build whatever they want. Most 
use computer science and others 
engineering, but it’s more about 
making connections and, you 
know, learning how to think in the 
hacking way.”

Individuals don’t necessarily 

have to have their teams fixed or 
even their projects planned out; 
organizers of MHacks provide a 
networking session for those still 
looking to join or build a team.

Chris 
Bradfield, 
a 
gradu-

ate student from University of 
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, was 
one of these students that just 
showed up. He said, aside from 
convenience, he came to MHacks 
because he wanted to experience 
programming. He did not have a 
team three hours before the hack-
ing began, but said he was willing 
to work by himself or loosely with 
another team.

“I just want to do something 

back-end web development,” he 
said. “When you go to a website 
you see the front end, everything 
behind it, that makes it work. 

Really, I just hope I get a team I 
can work with. That’s what I’m 
here for, the other people. But I’m 
not just going to ditch it if I don’t 
get a team, though.”

Zwick said people without a set 

group or people with no coding 
or hackathon experience can still 
find MHacks to be a valuable event 
to attend, as the aim of MHacks is 
to teach and inspire.

“Individuals leave here know-

ing a lot more than what they 
came in with,” Zwick said. “I’ve 
known people who’ve come here 
never ever coding before in their 
life and leaving having made an 
iOS app, and I think that’s pretty 
incredible.”

Jacobs and Walch, members of 

the winning team, said their next 
plan is to continue developing 
their app and participate in other 
hackathons, including TreeHacks 
and Seoul Global Hackathon, 
which fully sponsored the three 
winning teams’ trips to the inter-
national competition.

“No expectations going into 

this, so all these things that are 
now on the table are on the table,” 
Walch said.

Conrad Kramer, a previous 

winner, gave a short speech at the 
closing encouraging participants 
to continue working on their ideas. 
Kramer and his team, who had 
won MHacks III, further devel-
oped their now best-selling iOS 
app, WorkFlow. The app now has 
over 100,000 downloads and won 
the Editor’s Choice in the Apple 
App Store.

“Do not drop your projects,” 

Kramer said. “Build an awesome 
product.”

white social workers not to fall prey 
to a savior complex that often leads 
to racist behaviors and mindsets.

“I think that it’s important to 

remember that, for me, I see myself 
in doing whatever work I do out of 
a fundamental self-interest,” Bell 
said. “I do that out of a way to try to 
reclaim my humanity.”

Owusu warned against the use 

of body cameras as a method for 
curbing police brutality. He said 
while it will increase accountabili-
ty of the problem, it risks normaliz-
ing the behavior and desensitizing 
the community to violence.

He also lauded social media’s 

impact on bringing to light some of 
the injustice of police brutality and 
rallying support for victims of it.

“There’s a lot of talk about how 

online activism isn’t meaningful 
as opposed to traditional means of 
protest, but I think in conjunction 
to traditional protest, that’s what 

helped galvanize people in terms of 
Michael Brown and the Eric Gar-
ner killings,” Owusu said. “I think 
this is especially true when the 
media is sometimes uninterested 
in covering these stories or does it 
opportunistically.”

Several 
University 
learning 

communities sponsored the 28th 
annual “Circle of Unity” gathering, 
featuring musical performances 
and slam poetry to feature the lit-
erature and art that came out of the 
Civil Rights era.

Local artists Joe Reilly and 

Julie Beutel performed original 
compositions as well as spirituals 
from antebellum Black communi-
ties. The Michigan Gospel Chorale 
also performed the Black National 
Anthem.

At the end of the event, students 

stood at the podium to finish the 
statement “I have a dream…”

Rackham student Dan Green, 

also in the School of Social Work, 
was one of the event organizers, 
and said the University community 
should learn about the ideals and 
values Martin Luther King embod-

ied.

“I think learning what his beliefs 

actually were is very important,” 
Green said. “It’s more than what 
you see in movies and on posters. 
There’s so much more to Dr. King 
that should be learned about.”

Green hoped the event inspired 

and challenged those in attendance 
to be the change they wish to see on 
campus.

“There’s a lot of work to be 

done,” he said. “Everyone needs 
to be a part in order to make that 
change happen.”

The Black Volunteer Network 

also hosted their annual Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day program for 
21 high school students to discuss 
King’s leadership and the current 
state of activism, while encourag-
ing them to apply to the University.

The day began with the students 

listening to the symposium’s key-
note address, which this year was 
given by Marc Lamont Hill, host 
of HuffPost Live and BET News, 
as well as a political contributor to 
CNN.

Hevhynn Jackson, a senior at 

University High School Academy 
in Southfield, Mich., said Hill’s lec-
ture inspired her to become more 
socially active.

“I thought his speech entirely 

was really amazing and really 
spoke to me about how I need to get 
active and if I want to see a change 
I have to start making the change,” 
Jackson said.

The BVN event also examined 

academic, social and professional 
life at the University, including 
information on financial aid and 
scholarship options.

LSA senior Asia Bond, who is the 

BVN’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
co-chair, said the point is to inform 
visiting students about the Univer-
sity and the application process.

“We just want to give them the 

opportunity to come to Michigan 
seeing what it’s like, seeing that 
it’s not that far from home but you 
can still attend this University. And 
to meet us most of all, to get that 
one-on-one experience, that’s hav-
ing someone who can be a mentor 
somewhat,” Bond said.

Immediately 
following 
the 

keynote,Honors College residential 
assistants hosted their sixth annu-
al peer-group discussion.

LSA senior Colin McWatters, 

an event organizer, said the goal 
of the discussion was to discuss 
the influence of recent nationwide 
social movements on student lives, 
including those against police bru-
tality and for statewide same-sex 
marriage recognition.

“It’s important to focus on the 

impact of the problems, so we’re 
not just having conversations for 
five or 10 years and so we’re actu-
ally doing something,” McWatters 
said.

Students discussed how social 

justice could be used to build a 
more tolerant and diverse commu-
nity for all different types of indi-
viduals.

LSA sophomore Matt Sehrswee-

ney spoke of his perspective on the 
fight for social justice as a straight 
white male. He said it really “hit 
home” when he saw 1,000 students 
rally to call for the firing of former 
Athletic Director Dave Brandon, 
yet only 200 students participate in 

the die-in to protest police brutal-
ity in December.

“If I wanted to I could ignore 

those issues and I could be fine 
my whole life, but so many people 
can’t,” he said.

Rackham 
student 
Channing 

Mathews told the group how her 
friend heard white students mock 
students and the event during the 
die-in. Though Mathews spoke of 
some of the discouragement she 
felt after hearing about the encoun-
ter, she said by speaking to other 
like-minded individuals, including 
Sehrsweeney, she feels more hope-
ful.

“Even listening to Matt just 

made me feel a lot better than I’ve 
felt in the past eight months,” she 
said, turning to Sehrsweeney.

The University’s MLK Sympo-

sium hosts a variety of social jus-
tice themed events throughout the

ines will need to stop the high-
flying scoring duo of Myles Mack 
and Kadeem Jack, who average 14.7 

and 12.8 points per game, respec-
tively.

Mack, a 5-foot-10 guard, is a 

potential defensive match for 
freshman guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman if Albrecht and 
Walton are entirely unable to go.

The injuries, Beilein acknowl-

edged, have flipped Michigan’s 
status in the Big Ten — the Wol-
verines were among the confer-
ence’s “hunted” teams following 
a Final Four appearance in 2013 
and a trip to the Elite Eight the 

following season.

“We’re certainly hunters for 

the rest of the year,” Beilein said.

Beyond newfound opportuni-

ties for players like Lonergan, 
along with Abdur-Rahkman and 
fellow freshman guard Aubrey 

Dawkins, the injury void creates 
an obvious opportunity for soph-
omore forward Zak Irvin to step 
up.

This year, according to Beilein, 

Irvin has seen consistent growth 
as a passer, rebounder and defend-

er. Tuesday night represents a 
prime opportunity for the 6-foot-
6 swingman to take the next step — 
as Beilein said Monday, LeVert’s 19 
shots and 39 minutes per game are 
now there for the taking.

T

here’s a linguistic problem 
one encounters whenever 
talking about “terrorism.” 

“Terrorism” refers 
only 
to 
violence 

done to civilians 
for political pur-
poses by non-state 
actors. Thus, by definition, the Unit-
ed States, Israel and their allies can 
never do terrorism.

But state violence does, as a matter 

of fact, terrify people. What’s more, 
state actors can and do do violence 
on a much larger scale than non-state 
actors. But terrifying people and the 
scale of the violence doesn’t define 
“terrorism.” If they did, the United 
States would be the largest terrorist 
organization in the world. Because 
of the way the English language has 
evolved, we can’t call what the state 
(United States, Israel, Britain, etc.) 
does “terrorism,” even if they ter-
rify more people with violence on a 
larger scale than the supposed “ter-
rorists” do. Note the asymmetry: 
There’s no specific word for violence 
done by state actors. Therefore the 
prevalence of the word “terrorism” 
in popular political discourse and the 
lack of any corresponding term for 
violence done by state actors makes 
criticizing the “terrorists” relatively 
easy while making dissent against 
the state extra difficult.

The word “terrorism” implies a 

moral difference between these two 
types of violence and, by extension, 
a moral difference between those 
doing the violence. Calling something 
“an act of terrorism” automatically 
denounces and delegitimizes it. But 
when we compare the many instances 
of violence done by non-state actors 
and state actors, any intrinsic moral 
difference between the two breaks 
down. Thus we see that the word 
“terrorism” and its great popularity 
creates the appearance of a moral dif-
ference between the types of violence 
and violent actors, concealing the fact 
that there is none. While there might 
be certain distinctions that truly legit-
imize and delegitimize violence, such 
as the purposes and consequences of 
the violence, or the scale of the vio-
lence, the distinction between state 
actors and non-state actors is not 
among them.

Nonetheless, this false moral dis-

tinction endures in many people’s 
minds. Why? Does its existence reflect 
a natural moral distinction between 
violence done by state actors and non-
state actors? If that were true, we’d 
expect to see people across time and 
space making this distinction, but we 
do not. The word “terrorism” itself has 
only been in use very recently. So, the 
natural moral distinction, if there is 
one, must at least exist independent of 
the word “terrorism.”

At first glance, the word “commu-

nism” seems to reflect a similar dis-
tinction, but then again, this word has 
mostly been associated with enemy 
states, so the word “communism” 
doesn’t signify the distinction we’re 
looking for. Actually, the two words 
seem to reflect a similar moral dis-
tinction because both terms signify 
an enemy of the United States. Herein 
lies the salient difference guiding 
many Americans’ moral intuitions on 
the matter of legitimate and illegiti-
mate violence: the violence that “we” 
do (that is, violence done by the United 
States and its allies) is good because 
“we” are the ones doing it, whereas the 
violence that “they” do (that is, vio-
lence done by the terrorists, commu-
nists and so on) is bad because “they” 
are the ones doing it.

The logic of this argument plainly 

runs in circles: “We are good because 
we do good violence and our violence 
is good because we are good, etc. They 
are bad because they do bad violence 
and their violence is bad because they 
are bad, etc.” If “we” want to assert 
our moral superiority, we’ll have to 
find some better logic.

So why the endurance of this 

false moral distinction? Because the 
mainstream media and the U.S. gov-
ernment repeatedly reinforce the dis-
tinction in people’s minds every time 
they use terms like “terrorism,” “act 
of terror” or “terrorist.” Through the 
reinforcement of this false moral dis-
tinction, the mainstream media and 
the U.S. government regulate the flow 
of discourse by manipulating our lan-
guage such that it favors certain con-
clusions over others — e.g., the United 
States is good and its enemies (the ter-
rorists) are bad.

In the wake of “terrorist” attacks, 

like the recent attack on Charlie 

Hebdo, the cry for unity often drowns 
out dissenting opinions. Investigat-
ing the meaning of the word “terror-
ism” in the parlance of our times will 
therefore understandably offend some 
people. Despite our strong, liberal, 
democratic desire to always be polite, 
this is not sufficient reason to stop ask-
ing these questions.

On the other hand, it would be 

heartless as well as intellectually sus-
pect to deny the feelings of those who 
are offended. People who feel offend-
ed by such questions and ensuing 
arguments probably empathize very 
strongly with the victims of these ter-
rorist attacks, and they feel that such 
questions and arguments aim to criti-
cize their feelings. And in a way they 
are right. We should inquire: Do these 
people empathize equally with the 
victims of state terrorism and with the 
victims of non-state terrorism? If the 
answer is no, as I suspect, we should 
then ask: By what logic do they dis-
criminate between legitimate and ille-
gitimate victims as well as legitimate 
and illegitimate violence?

Some might object, saying that my 

argument seeks to uncover hidden 
biases, but that my argument itself is 
biased — that is, biased in favor of the 
so-called “terrorists” or the victims 
of state terrorism. And I understand 
why it might seem that way. Because 
the popular bias in favor of violence 
done by state actors and against vio-
lence done by non-state actors is so 
pervasive and profound, it will seem 
like I’m valuing the lives of the vic-
tims of state violence above the lives 
of victims of non-state violence, when 
what I’m really doing is equating the 
two. By arguing that there’s no intrin-
sic moral difference between violence 
done by state actors and non-state 
actors, I’m also arguing that there’s 
no reason to empathize more with 
the victims of state actors than with 
the victims of non-state actors. Again, 
we could probably find ways to dis-
criminate between legitimate and ille-
gitimate victims as well as legitimate 
and illegitimate forms of violence, but 
the ways of discriminating implied 
by the word “terrorism” would still 
 

be irrelevant.

I

t’s that time of year when the 
snow boots come out, the Can-
ada Goose jackets go on and the 

out-of-staters 
get 

ridiculed for think-
ing they knew what 
cold was before they 
came to Michigan.

As a Californian, I took and still 

take the brunt of this mockery. During 
my freshman year, “in-staters” asked 
me if I had ever seen snow before. 
They asked how cold it gets in my 
hometown, Palo Alto, during the win-
ter. They made sure I knew that I had 
no idea what I was getting into for the 
upcoming months.

I held onto the one piece of infor-

mation that I hoped would give me a 
bit of weather street cred: I was from 
Northern California. My winters were 
not 60 degrees and sunny like in Los 
Angeles, they were 40 degrees and 
rainy. Unlike my SoCal dorm mates, 
I had seen snow, though only when I 
drove four hours to Tahoe for a family 
skiing trip. I also knew of and already 
owned a North Face jacket. I was sure 
I wouldn’t be as shocked by winter as 
the surfer dudes down the hall.

But was I really prepared for my 

first Michigan winter? Of course 
not. The boots I had bought in Cali-
fornia were suede, and my feet were 
soaked and freezing the first time it 
snowed. I walked home from a party 
in two-degree weather, only to spend 
the night curled in a ball in my dorm, 
unable to get warm. The next day I 
went out and bought Hunters and a 
Patagonia winter jacket.

Michigan cold was like nothing 

I had ever experienced: The sting-
ing cold on your face and the way 
your ears hurt when you are walk-

ing home at night without a hat. The 
instantaneous cough that rises from 
your throat when you step out into 
the cold air for the first time that day. 
The panic you feel when your phone 
shuts off because the air is too cold for 
the electronics to work. I had never 
known that type of cold. The one ben-
efit is that I found the one thing that 
will sober me up faster than anything 
— cold air without a jacket.

Michigan cold and California cold 

are unique in ways beyond the differ-
ence in numerical temperature. Win-
ter is the rainy season in California. 
When I came to Michigan and learned 
it was colder when the sun was shin-
ing than when it was raining, I was 
very disconcerted, and honestly, it still 
pisses me off.

I don’t think anyone gets used 

to Michigan winters. “In-staters” 
complain about the cold just as 
much as “out-of-staters”. While 
I got taunted with “Why the hell 
would you move here?” questions, 
they get just as much scorn with 
“Shouldn’t you be used to this by 
now?” inquiries. We all feel the cold 
the same and the seasonal depres-
sion hits all of us when February 
comes around.

My answer to the “Why the hell 

would you move here?” question has 
always been the same. I wanted to 
prove I could live somewhere other 
than California, and better to do it 
when I’m young, drunk and surround-
ed by people my age to “cuddle” for 
warmth with than at any other time 
in my life.

However, I will always feel like I 

didn’t get the full Michigan winter 
experience. I missed the only snow 
day in 75 years. I skipped the entire 

polar vortex because I was study-
ing abroad in sunny Australia. I will 
never know what minus-40 degrees 
with a minus-10 wind chill feels like. 
But I’m not sorry in the slightest. I 
picked a really good winter to not be 
in Michigan.

I like to humblebrag to my 

friends back in California that they 
shouldn’t be complaining about a 
30-degree New Year’s Eve, because 
if it breaks 25 in the middle of Janu-
ary in Michigan, that is considered a 
heat wave. The few sunny 36-degree 
days we get in the middle of win-
ter — thanks to Ann Arbor’s sense-
less weather changes — give me just 
enough hope to make it through the 
rest of winter, which usually lasts 
until finals week.

I got lured into a false sense of 

security my freshman year when 
it was 60 and sunny on St. Patrick’s 
Day. I thought “two months of hor-
rible weather and then it’s fine by 
March 17, I can do that.” But those 
snow flurries in April break your 
heart just when you think you are 
home free for spring.

I really think that some of my 

friends deal with worse weather 
than we do. Many of my friends 
ventured up north to Oregon and 
Washington for their college expe-
riences. I would take cold and snow 
over 300 days of rain any day. Rain 
is dark. Rain is depressing. Rain is 
wet and inconvenient.

But this is my first Michigan winter 

since sophomore year, and I’m a little 
worried that I have forgotten just how 
miserable they really can be.

Preparing for Michigan winter

G

ov. Rick Snyder approved a number of bills concerning 
criminal justice Jan. 12, including one that requires DNA 
collection of those accused of felonies, including nonviolent 

ones, upon arraignment, and another that expands the type of offenses 
that can be expunged from a person’s criminal record. Senate Bills 105-
107 were signed with the general intent to decrease overall recidivism. 
According to Snyder, the DNA collection bill was specifically designed 
to “help identify suspects earlier in the investigation process.” Though 
expungement will likely help stimulate economic recovery of past 
criminals, the DNA sample collection of all accused is invasive and 
violates basic privacy rights of those who are supposed to be “innocent 
until proven guilty.”

Before Senate Bill 105 was signed into law, 

DNA samples were only taken from suspected 
felons in cases of violent crime. Now, this 
sampling at the time of arraignment will be 
expanded to suspects of nonviolent crime, 
including those accused of drug, property 
and white-collar offenses. In the event 
that a suspect is charged with an offense, 
their sample is to be forwarded and kept 
for departmental use. Concurrently, the 
approval of House Bill 4186 expands the 
ability for all persons with one felony change 
and two misdemeanors to petition for 
expungement five years after their sentence 
is completed. Previously, expungement was 
only possible for those under 21. The list of 
non-expungeable crimes has been expanded 
to add felonies including second-degree child 
abuse and terrorism offenses.

The new law broadening expungement 

ability will help those who have completed 
their 
criminal 
sentencing 
recover 

economically and avoid the stigma associated 
with felonies. According to the Center for 
Economic and Policy Research, ex-convicts 
are seen as significantly less employable, and 
employment losses from the neglect to hire 
these individuals lowered the nation’s GDP 
between $57 and $65 billion in 2008. Increased 
employability will not only benefit the past 
offenders themselves, but may also stimulate 
the state economy. In addition, those with 
expunged offenses may have a better chance at 
being approved for housing, which may help to 
decrease the significant rates of homelessness 
among ex-offenders.

Though collecting DNA samples at the 

time of arraignment may be beneficial when 
convicting repeat violent offenders, it’s an 
utterly unnecessary protocol for those accused 
of nonviolent crimes. The Senate Fiscal Agency 
estimates that the state collects approximately 
3,000 felony suspect DNA samples yearly and 
predicts that, with the new law, that amount 
may rise to roughly 12,000, an increase that 
would not come without a cost. Fingerprints 
are already taken upon arrest, so the need for 
using additional DNA samples to track repeat 
offenders is unclear. More importantly, though 
the DNA samples will only be tested after the 
accused individual is charged with the offense, 
the fact that this personal information is on 
the record is a gross violation of privacy and 
infringes upon the central tenet of the criminal 
justice system; that one is innocent until proven 
guilty. Also concerning is the penalty for a 
suspect’s refusal to provide the sample. Doing 
so would result in a fine of not more than $1,000 
or up to one year in jail — an unnecessary 
measure.

Snyder’s approval of Senate Bills 105-107 

simultaneously benefits certain ex-offenders 
while threatening the privacy of those accused 
of nonviolent felonies. Ultimately, broadening 
expungement after five years for certain 
offenses is economically positive for both the 
individual and the state. Conversely, mandatory 
DNA collection upon arraignment of the 
accused violates privacy and the presumption 
of innocence, which could lead to premature 
decision-making in criminal cases. Together, 
the new laws will affect those ending criminal 
sentences and those who may not have them, 
for better and for worse, respectively.

An invasion of basic rights

FROM THE DAILY

Nolan Loh/Daily

I 

love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. I loved 
them on “Saturday Night Live,” I loved 
them in “Baby Mama” and I intend to love 

them a year from now when 
“Sisters” comes out in the-
aters. I would love them if 
all they did was stand up on 
a stage and read the entirety 
of the iTunes Terms and Conditions. They’re 
brilliant writers, incredible comedians and 
exemplary role models for women working in 
 

male-dominated fields.

I got suckered into watching the Golden 

Globes last week in no small part because the 
duo was hosting. And it’s my admiration for 
these women that made their monologue at the 
Golden Globes such a disappointment for me.

On the one hand, they were able to humor-

ously capture the particular difficulties faced 
by women in Hollywood, namely the lack of 
compelling roles for older women. Of Patricia 
Arquette’s performance in “Boyhood,” Poehler 
said the film proves that there are still great 
roles for women over 40, as long as you get 
hired when you’re under 40.”

Fey pointed to the absurdity of praising 

men in Hollywood for sitting through hours of 
makeup when women — us laypeople included 
— are expected to be made up just to be present-
able in public: “It took me three hours today to 
prepare for my role as human woman.”

The monologue was entertaining and clever, 

filled with humorous but poignant social com-
mentary on gender inequality.

Then there was the rape joke:
“In ‘Into the Woods,’ Cinderella runs from 

her prince, Rapunzel is thrown from her tower 
for her prince and Sleeping Beauty just thought 
that she was getting coffee with Bill Cosby,” 
Poehler said.

This was followed by a series of uncom-

fortable Cosby impressions that were shoddy 
at best and racist at worst. However, my dis-
comfort with the bit comes from more than 
the over-the-top impersonation of a Black 
voice by a white person. It comes also from the 
reckless insensitivity shown for the victims 
of the sexual assaults that are the centerpiece 
of this joke. When sexual assaults are so dis-
proportionately committed against women, 

A bad joke

SYDNEY 
HARTLE

it was absolutely appalling to have 
two comedians who showed such 
astuteness to sexism making light of 
it. You can’t quip about the discrim-
ination faced by women out one side 
of your mouth and spit jokes at the 
expense of sexual assault victims 
out the other.

Arguably, the intended target of 

the joke was Bill Cosby and not the 
women coming forward to name him 
as their assailant. And make no mis-
take, he deserves to be called out for 
his behavior. The problem is that com-
paring sexual assault victims to Sleep-
ing Beauty trivializes a serious and 
traumatic real-life experience. The 
problem is that bumbling impressions 
of Bill Cosby that present him as a 
clueless moron relieve him of a degree 

of accountability for his actions. 
The impressions reduced the drug-
ging and assault of women from an 
intentional decision to an “Oopsies!” 
that renders the victims mere props 
rather than human beings who were 
 

deliberately violated.

Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are 

smart women. They are skilled 
comedians who were definitely 
aware that the joke was risky when 
they chose to include it in their Gold-
en Globes monologue. The question 
is why they did it anyway. I’m aware 
that good jokes can be bawdy, off-
color and even downright offensive. 
Lewdness is sometimes the price we 
pay for biting social commentary, 
but the Cosby joke made a carica-
ture of his speech pattern instead 

of underlining the atrocity of his 
treatment of women. The Bill Cosby 
situation absolutely bears further 
discussion, but a silly impression 
does not strike me in any way as the 
correct avenue for doing so.

I think “betrayed” is probably 

the most accurate word for what 
I’m feeling in the aftermath of that 
monologue. I still adore Fey and 
Poehler, but I think that a rape joke 
is a lot to ignore in the name of blind 
admiration. Instead, it’s important 
to integrate their poor choices into 
my understanding of them as imper-
fect individuals. They still need to be 
called out for their mistakes.

‘Broad City’ back

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Abbi and Ilana hit 
career high in new 
season premiere

We’ve been counting down (four 

and three and two and one) since 
last season, and Comedy Central’s 
best 
gal-pals 

stride are final-
ly back! Abbi 
and Ilana have 
returned 
with 

their crop-tops 
high and heads 
held even high-
er, with their 
sweat 
stains 

large and their 
personalities 
even greater so.

Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer 

(“High and Dry”) have brought 
along Seth Rogen (“The Inter-
view”) for their sophomore sea-
son premiere, in what is one of the 
finest written episodes since the 
series’ conception (and quite possi-
bly one of the best written sitcoms 
of the year).

The show opens with Abbi and 

her new boy toy, Stacy (Rogen), 
amid a horrendous urban heat 
wave that causes Stacy to pass out 
mid-climax. Abbi, in her awkward 
glory, proceeds to finish – but ret-
rospectively wonders if that makes 
her a rapist the next day. To rem-
edy her wrongs, she decides that 
her janky apartment needs an air 
conditioner, so she drags Ilana 
along to Bed, Bath & Beyond where 
she shimmies and handshakes 
with employees who know her on 
a first-name basis. Unfortunately, 
the pair avert their eyes for just a 
moment, and the AC they’ve pur-
chased is stolen in an instant. Ilana 
proposes they return to her NYU 
dorm in alumni fashion, and take 
the AC that should be rightfully 
theirs. Of course, they classically 
get sidetracked on their mission – 
but they end up positively asserting 
their alumni influence on today’s 
youth by encouraging the inno-
cent, unsuspecting dorm residents 
to hit up a bong together. While 
higher than the empire state, Abbi 
makes out with one of the boys, 
who reveals he is (yikes) actually a 

visiting high school student.

“Broad City” ’s setting is nothing 

new, nor the premise anything rev-
olutionary – simply two post-grad 
girls stumbling aimlessly around 
New York City. However, the show 
centers on two characters who 
stray the most radically from any 
archetypes – and who believe that 
not only the show, but the universe 
revolves around them.

If the show’s first season had 

one flaw, it’s that Abbi and Ilana’s 
experience is so singular and can 
be hard to relate to. They had no 
greater ambitions beyond immedi-
ate gratification – no career goals, 
no infatuations beyond fleeting 
crushes, no fucks to give about 
anything significant. However, this 
is the one show where these some-
what pathetic, dispassionate (but 
oh, so passionate) characters are so 
endearing, even with every cringe-
worthy adventure of debauchery.

As an audience, we have been 

wired to see characters always in 
pursuit of “the dream job” or “the 
dream girl.” Abbi and Ilana just 
want an AC – but in their minds, 
this endeavor is anything but triv-
ial. It is we who must learn to not be 
surprised about their questionable 
life choices – not them who must 
adjust to the responsibilities of the 
real world.

These two women are the 

polar opposite to the “glamor-
ous,” “graceful,” “size zero” female 
standards that are seen on televi-
sion continuously. Their character 
development (or lack thereof) lies 
in immediate pleasures. Even pro-
gressing from pilot to sophomore 
season, neither Abbi nor Ilana have 
matured – evidenced especially 
when they retort with insults like: 
“Maybe your dad should’ve pulled 
out!” They do not attempt to pres-
ent the audience with any bullshit 
quasi-poignant lessons about living 
lives as twenty-somethings. They 
do not attempt to mask any inad-
equacies, and they do not attempt 
to present a façade to obscure any 
imperfections. They just are, and 
that is the most refreshing thing.

We have defaulted to expecting 

force-fed “morals” from television, 
that when the only lesson Abbi and 
Ilana hand us is the reassurance 
that our decision-making skills are 
not nearly as fucked up as theirs. 
We’re caught off guard. Jacobson 
and Glazer do nothing more than 

tell a story purely for comedy – no 
ulterior intentions, no instillations 
of lessons that are supposed to 
make us “better human beings.” 
They entertain just to entertain – a 
concept quite scarce on television. 

Because Abbi and Ilana have 

no devotion to anything except 
each other, we see a raw relation-
ship unhindered by any other 
responsibilities in their lives. It’s 
quite revitalizing to see females 
who genuinely only care about 
each other (even if that may be 
at the expense of other cares). 
While they do include men in 
their plots, none of their decisions 
are actually inspired or provoked 
by them. Stacy may have been 
the inciting incident to ensure no 
other sexual partners pass out in 
the future, but Abbi is the only to 
come up with that solution, sug-
gested with input from no one 
else, and with no other support 
except from her gurrrrl, Ilana. 
Beyond their quirks, they have 
a feminism that makes them all-
powerful. The duo does not need 
complex plotlines or pseudo-
grandeur aspirations or air condi-
tioner. They have their friendship 
and that’s enough.

Nevertheless, Abbi and Ilana 

still inadvertently say something 
about how difficult living life in 
your 20s actually is, especially 
while trying to maintain finan-
cial and social stability in New 
York City. However, while other 
shows demonstrate this des-
peration to survive in this urban 
monster through drama and 
tears, Abbi and Ilana tear the city 
apart. They make the city their 
bitch simply because they are too 
immature (and too indifferent) to 
take adult problems seriously. 

While yelling at a cat in the 

final scene, in their fit of anger, 
they accidentally bump their sto-
len air conditioner out the win-
dow, crashing down to its death. 
Their toil was all for naught – but 
hey, are we surprised? Well, we 
shouldn’t be. Karma is a bitch, 
sometimes for no reason, and 
everything has come full circle. 
One thing is for sure: Abbi and 
Ilana will never fall prey to rou-
tine because the epitome of what 
they are is unpredictable – a qual-
ity that seems to be wearing thin 
in modern television. In their 
mundanity, there is hilarity.

Art in a changing 
cultural climate

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

T

wo masked gunmen 
stormed the offices of 
French satirical maga-

zine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7 and 
subsequently killed 12 employ-
ees, including four cartoonists, 
an economist, 
two police 
officers and the 
Editor-in-Chief 
of the publica-
tion. Eleven 
others at the 
scene were 
wounded dur-
ing the attack, 
some gravely. 
As a nation 
rocked under the aftershock 
of the worst terrorist attack in 
France since 1961, journalists 
and civilians, alike, took to their 
respective mediums of expres-
sion to declare the death of free 
speech by radical extremism. 
The attacks were in direct retali-
ation to the magazine’s cartoons, 
which showed the prophet 
Muhammad in compromising 
situations and satirized Islamic 
ideologies.

First and foremost, it should be 

noted that cartoons, as depicted 
on the covers of Charlie Hebdo, 
fall under a large umbrella of art, 
and should thus be subjected to 
the same standards other forms 
of art are granted when it comes 
to freedom of speech. Artists are 
guaranteed freedom of expres-
sion, except in cases of child por-
nography, threatening motives or 
a handful of other exceptions to 
the rule. 

As I write this column, I’m 

consistently struck by a moral 
dilemma. 
While 
I 
consider 

myself non-religious, in my heart 
I object to several of the Charlie 
Hebdo covers under scrutiny. 
The distortion of such an impor-
tant figure in such a prominent 
religion is offensive, and the 
repeated targeting of one spe-
cific religion by the publication 
strikes me as troublesome and 
xenophobic. However, above all 
these objections, I hold freedom 
of speech in the utmost regard, 
regardless of context. The rights 
laid out in the first amendment 
are undoubtedly the founda-
tion of democracy in any society, 
and we cannot begin to pick and 
choose when the freedom of 
speech is appropriate or not, 
especially in the world of politi-
cal art. It’s important to learn 
about art like Andres Serrano’s 
“Piss Christ” like I did in my 
AP U.S. Government class, not 
because it’s a particularly beau-
tiful or influential piece on its 
own, but because it’s a test of our 
nation’s ability to question norms 
— religious, political, what have 
you — without fear of govern-
ment persecution. 

The United States, as well 

as France and other Western 
countries, are seeing an influx 
of immigrants from all different 
parts of the world, all with dif-
ferent ideas of the limits of free 
speech. As globalization increas-
es, should satirical art change to 
accommodate the sensitivities of 
other cultures?

It comes without question that 

with 
increased 
globalization, 

cultural awareness is necessary. 
Every culture has its customs, 
quirks and taboos, and it’s our 
job as citizens of a global world 
to become aware to these quirks 
and develop sensitivity to cer-
tain topics considered rude or 
blasphemous, even if they may 
not appear so from our own cul-
tural 
experiences. 
However, 

art is meant to break rules and 
challenge social norms, and thus 
shouldn’t be held to the same 
standards as everyday interac-
tions. Art — real, textbook art — 
is supposed to incite something 
within us. We’re supposed to 
look at a piece and feel an emo-
tion, and that feeling could be 
happiness, sadness or anger. 
While there was obviously anger 
incited by the Charlie Hebdo 
cover (which reached the point 
of a terrorist attack), these ter-
rorists were radicals, and chang-
ing rules regarding freedom of 
speech in response will break 
down a complex system of West-
ern freedoms that entice immi-
grants to come to America or 
France in the first place. We must 
defend the sanctity of art at all 
costs, because artistic expression 
is the basis of human culture. 
The ability to critique our sur-
roundings, without fear of per-
secution or death, is the core of 
democratic freedom.

‘Girls in Peacetime’

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

My admittedly limited colle-

giate experiences have taught me 
that college bands are typically 
too immature and overeager to 
focus on cre-
ating one par-
ticular type of 
sound. Excited 
by the process 
and possibility 
of acceptance, 
young 
talents 

generally 
cre-

ate a scurried 
amalgamation 
of sounds that 
derive 
from 

their personal 
strengths 
or 

multiple mutual interests and 
inspirations. In the early ’90s, 
from the quiet, urban campus 
of Stow University in Glasgow, 
Scotland emerged a college band 
of this definition. An indescrib-
able collection of musicians – 
including the now famous Stuart 
Murdoch – were recognized by 
a music professor at Stow, Alan 
Rankine, who guided the young 
tribe into their first recording 
studio. 

Upon gaining more members 

and momentum, the fresh-faced 
band produced their first full-
length album at the college’s 
record label as Belle & Sebastian. 
The album, titled Tigermilk, was 
met with mild acclaim. Multiple 
albums followed with a couple 
subtractions and additions from 
the group, and the Scottish band 
entered the 21st century as a crit-
ically acclaimed indie band. Pur-
posely eccentric and traditionally 
adventurous, Belle & Sebastian 
has inspired the work of many: 
modern 
bands 
like 
Vampire 

Weekend, The Shins and Arcade 
Fire have created content filled 

with definitive strains of Belle 
& Sebastian’s influence. Wistful 
lyrics and pop music, or sad lyr-
ics with a quiet acoustic guitar, 
Belle & Sebastian has aged into a 
musical anomaly. Changing con-
stantly, and vaguely described 
as a “folk-pop” band, the group 
has never really been defined by 
anything certain. Although con-
taining the maturity and talent of 
an aged collection of musicians, 
Belle & Sebastian’s musical ran-
domness keeps the band as col-
legiate as ever. 

Ending a five-year hiatus the 

band took for equally random 
side projects, this well-awaited 
ninth album, Girls in Peacetime 
Want to Dance greets fans of new 
and old in a state of noticeable 
depression. 

The first song of the album, 

“Nobody’s Empire,” tells the 
story of a boy getting tested and 
touched by doctors because he 
won’t leave his room. When 
interviewed by The Guardian, 
Murdoch described the open-
ing track as a testament to his 
daily struggle against myalgic 
encephalomyelitis, 
a 
chronic 

fatigue disorder causing constant 
emotional and physical stagna-
tion. The group’s lyrics dip in 
and out of Murdoch’s personal 
vat of human sadness consis-
tently throughout the album. 
The listener is then slipped into 
the taunting mind of a young girl 
named Allie who, in a song of 
the same title, is telling herself 
“When there are bombs in the 
Middle East / you want to hurt 
yourself / When there’s knives 
in the streets you want to end 
yourself.” More political than 
Belle & Sebastian has ever dared 
to be, the song tells the story of 
an anxious adolescent battling 
our violent world — all set to a 
happy-go-lucky beat and grow-
ing electric guitar sound. Here 

salutations should be adminis-
tered once again to the perfected 
randomness of Belle & Sebastian. 

Girls in Peacetime Want to 

Dance is deliciously synthesized. 
Upbeat and fun, “Enter Sylvia 
Plath” and “The Party Line” are 
cousins of a Fitz & the Tantrums 
dance number. “Enter Sylvia 
Plath” is an especially interest-
ing song; never before has music 
so synthesized or joyful held 
Sylvia Plath as the subject. And 
“The Party Line,” the first single 
off the album, is a Pet Shop Boys 
number that is sure to excite the 
crowds and reiterate the band’s 
relevance at their upcoming 
summer festival engagements, 
including Coachella and Bonna-
roo. 

Coffee-sipping, slow morning 

songs reminiscent of Dear Catas-
trophe Waitress and other early 
Belle & Sebastian reappears in 
tracks “The Power of Three” and 
“Ever Had a Little Faith.” Sarah 
Martin, the keyboardist and 
occasional vocalist of the band, 
tells an ironic and seemingly 
precious story in “The Power of 
Three.” Filled with references 
to the world of Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle and the concern that 
“Everybody has their Moriarty,” 
the song is another reminder that 
time has not lessened the random 
genius of this clever little band. 

Idiosyncratic 
and 
overall 

upbeat, these Glaswegian musi-
cians have released a ninth 
album far better than most vet-
eran bands. Age and time haven’t 
lessened the talents of this mis-
matched group. Instead, they 
have made the band highly aware 
of its audience and the freedoms 
that those followers will contin-
ue to adore. This old indie band 
has the following of a popular 
college band, one that a univer-
sity will ardently support despite 
artistic strangeness.

Lupe’s stellar return

By KEN SELANDER

Daily Arts Writer

Scanning over my first casual, 

relaxed account of Lupe Fiasco’s 
Tetsuo 
& 

Youth , I noted 
that 
I 
didn’t 

hear any real 
“bangers” 
on 

the record. The 
length of the 
songs 
proved 

tiring 
and 

forgettable, the 
instrumentals 
seemed a bit out of place, but I 
still thought it was well produced 
on the whole, anyway. 

It wasn’t until my second time 

listening through with a more 
attentive ear that I realized 
how jaw-dropping this album 
is: I focused in on the lyrics 
and structure of each song and 
had my mind blown. “Mural” 
is a mesmerizing masterpiece, 
“Deliver” is filled with soul-
wrenching 
symbolism 
and 

“Prisoner 1 & 2” manages to 
take a cliché theme in rap and 
politics and repackage it in a 
new, exciting way (with maybe 
a little inspiration from skits in 
Kendrick’s good kid, m.A.A.d 
city). 

While 
completely 

unintentional, my own change 
of heart is a near perfect 
representation 
of 
the 
issues 

Lupe Fiasco has been facing as 
a rapper and artist throughout 
his career. He’s experienced 
resistance because his tracks 
don’t fit the mold for the music 
industry’s standard hit. Lupe 
often complains about the label 
interfering with his music. “Dots 
& Lines” calls out major labels 
for limiting his artistic voice and 
artists for selling their souls for 
money, directly telling listeners 
in a catchy chorus, “don’t sign.”

His tracks are often double 

or even triple the length of an 
average song – “Chopper” alone 
runs for 9.5 minutes. It’s hard to 
get radio play with records that 
long. Furthermore, it seems that 
most people don’t want to have 
to think so deeply about their 
music. Lupe’s lyrics and rhyme 
schemes are so intricate you have 
to listen over and over again just 
to get a basic understanding of a 
track. I could listen to “Mural” or 
“Adoration of the Magi” for a day 
straight and still not discover all 
that the songs have to offer.

Listening to “Prisoner 1 & 2,” 

which has numerous references 
to Maya Angelou’s famous “I 
Know Why the Caged Bird 
Sings,” I could not help but 
directly contrast the soulful, 
meticulous track to Gucci Mane’s 
mixtape The State vs. Radric 
Davis II: The Caged Bird Sings. 
And how entirely different the 
two are. 

Artists 
like 
Waka 
Flocka 

Flame and Gucci Mane don’t care 
to make complex or highly lyrical 
music (Waka has been quoted in 
an interview with Noisey saying 
just this of himself). The recent 
rise of rappers like Migos and 
Young Thug reinforces the fact 
that many consumers don’t care 
for the complex, multilayered 
works 
of 
art 
that 
Lupe 

produces. I can’t understand 
any words except “lifestyle” 
and “beginning” in Rich Gang’s 
“Lifestyle (ft. Young Thug, Rich 
Homie Quan)” and it landed at 
number 16 on the Billboard Hot 
100. This trend certainly can’t 
be good for Lupe’s record sale 
prospects.

“Chopper” 
on 
Tetsuo 
& 

Youth serves to address those 
who propagate and imitate the 
lifestyle of gangster rappers, 
even 
referencing 
Waka 
and 

Brick Squad. The song’s simple 
chorus 
and 
bridge 
parodies 

the simplicity of such records, 
and is a powerful satire of the 

“hood rich” lifestyle with talk 
of “Filet Mignon with my food 
stamps.” The lines “Sayin’ free 
they guys like I’m dirty / With a 
clean record but I’m cursed / To 
make a half a million off a verse,” 
encompass so much in so few 
lines.

I’d argue that Lupe fell off for 

a good while, The Cool being the 
last album where he was true to 
himself. Probably, in an attempt 
to compromise with industry 
pressures, his talents stagnated 
thereafter. He’s been open about 
his conflict with music labels over 
control of his music in the past 
with songs like “Dumb It Down,” 
and again addresses the issue of a 
certain recognition coupled with 
distaste for his artsy fartsy style 
in the opening lines of “Adoration 
of the Magi” on Tetsuo & Youth. 
“Blur My Hands” is a lovely 
example of his creative ability, 
taking something as rude and 
indecent as flicking someone off 
and making it a creative, non-
vulgar song addressing those 
who embody any of the criticism 
he receives. 

In any event, Lupe’s back. 
Tetsuo & Youth is mostly 

amazing, but I don’t feel the 
instrumentals “Summer,” “Fall” 
and “Winter” mesh with the 
tracks musically, and the same 
for the banjo intro and outro 
to “Dots & Lines.” My personal 
dislike for artists who sacrifice 
pleasurable music or practicality 
to be artsy definitely factors into 
my opinion – can you say Yeezus? 
– but Lupe’s ability to implement 
such depth and still produce an 
enjoyable album from a purely 
pleasure based lens overrides 
this. I don’t know if Tetsuo & 
Youthwill sell, but I’m sold on it.

‘M’ holds off Northwestern

By MAX BULTMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Plagued by sicknesses to two 

key contributors, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team found a 
way to get the job done.

Even with junior guard Spike 

Albrecht out with a respiratory 
infection and freshman center 
Ricky Doyle playing minimal 
minutes due to a cold, the 
Wolverines 
squeaked 
out 
a 

thrilling win over Northwestern, 
56-54.

Junior guard Caris LeVert 

had 18 points, seven assists and 
six rebounds in a game that 
saw 
Northwestern 
in 
prime 

position to pull off a game-tying 
buzzer-beater on the game’s final 
possession.

Wildcats’ 
guard 
Bryant 

McIntosh put up a runner with 
the final seconds ticking down, 
but his shot rimmed out and 
LeVert did just enough to clear 
the rebound as time expired.

“I don’t know how (we got the 

win), but we end up getting it, 
and we’ll take it,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “I’m really 
proud of the way our kids played 
through some adversity.”

Northwestern was able to 

stay in the game by exploiting a 
stark mismatch down low. With 
Doyle sidelined, Wildcats center 
Alex Olah dominated redshirt 
freshman Mark Donnal in the 
post, forcing Donnal into foul 
trouble and leading to big minutes 
for senior forward Max Bielfeldt.

And though Olah held a 

significant height and weight 
advantage over both Wolverine 
big men, Beilein went to various 
zone defenses in an effort to 
minimize his advantage.

“We couldn’t stop (Olah) down 

low,” Beilein said. “It’s a matchup 

that we just did not like, so we 
went away from him.”

Whereas 
Doyle’s 
sickness 

caused problems on the defensive 
side 
of 
the 
ball, 
Albrecht’s 

absence left Beilein with a 
difficult decision on who to insert 
into the starting lineup.

Freshman forward Kameron 

Chatman had the most experience 
starting, as he did for the first two 
months of the season, but Beilein 
thought it would be better to stay 
with the smaller lineup for the 
sake of consistency. Accordingly, 
he turned to freshman guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman alongside sophomore 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. in 
the backcourt. And both young 
guards delivered.

Walton looked as sharp as he 

has since sustaining a toe injury 
against Villanova on Nov. 25, 
making more deliberate cuts 
and moving better away from 
the ball. He was even able to find 

more open space, getting free and 
shooting an impressive 4-for-6 
from beyond the arc.

Meanwhile, Abdur-Rahkman 

held his own and kept up with the 
tempo of the game, even coming 
up with a few key buckets for 
the Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 11-7 
overall). With 8:17 remaining, 
LeVert 
saw 
Abdur-Rahkman 

cutting to the rim in transition, 
hitting the freshman for a smooth 
layup to tie the game at 45.

His nine points were the third 

highest on the team behind 
LeVert and Walton, and none 
of them were bigger than his 
dagger 3-pointer with just under 
a minute to play, extending the 
Wolverines’ lead to 56-52. 

“I think it’s big, especially 

for the rest of our season, to 
have these guys sort of out of 
their comfort zone playing big 
minutes,” Bielfeldt said. “With 
Muhammad doing that tonight, 
you know when Spike is back 

he’s probably not going to start, 
he’s probably going to come 
off the bench with a lot more 
enthusiasm.”

Early in the game, LeVert 

and Walton appeared as though 
they would carry Michigan to a 
runaway win. LeVert unleashed 
a wicked crossover before finding 
Walton for a corner triple eight 
minutes into the game, then 
followed it up with a 3-pointer of 
his own on the next possession to 
give Michigan an early 21-11 lead. 
The back-to-back threes were 
part of an 18-0 Wolverine run in 
the first half.

But Northwestern (1-4, 10-8) 

answered, riding 13 first-half 
points from Olah and a buzzer-
beater at the end of the first frame 
to take a 32-31 lead into halftime. 
The Wildcats went on to stretch 
their lead to large as five points 
in the second half before Abdur-
Rahkman tied the game and hit 
the eventual game-winner.

Behind Enemy Lines: 
Rutgers’ Myles Mack

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Even with an injury report 

that grows by the day, the Big 
Ten schedule won’t wait for the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team to get 
healthy. 
Tuesday, 
the 
Wolverines 
(4-2 
Big 
Ten, 

11-7 overall) will travel to 
Piscataway to take on Rutgers.

While 
not 
much 
was 

expected this season from the 
Scarlet Knights (2-4, 10-9), 
they recently turned heads 
with an upset over then-No. 4 
Wisconsin. They have since lost 
to Minnesota and Maryland, 
but Tuesday’s game may not be 
a cupcake game for Michigan, 
as it was once billed.

Leading the Scarlet Knights 

is senior guard Myles Mack, 
who averages 14.7 points and 
4.5 assists.

The Daily sat down with 

Mack at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to talk about the 
transition to the Big Ten, 
expectations in the tougher 
conference and how former 
NBA coach Eddie Jordan has 
handled the switch to coaching 
college basketball.

The Michigan Daily: Are 

you excited to see more of the 
Midwest this year after being 
on the East Coast a lot in the 
early parts of your time at 
Rutgers?

Myles Mack: It’s a great 

opportunity to come out to the 
Midwest and play these great 
teams. (I’m) just happy to have 
the opportunity to do that.

TMD: Is it going to be a hard 

transition to play in your third 

different league in three years?

MM: 
No, 
I 
mean, 
the 

transitions haven’t been that 
bad. I mean, it’s just basketball, 
so at the end of the day it’s the 
same thing.

TMD: Are people buying 

into his message? Is he teaching 
different things? What exactly 
is he trying to do to connect the 
team?

MM: He’s just trying to 

connect the team the best way he 
can. He’s getting us to do more 
things off the court together. (He 
wants us) to make better bonds, 
better chemistry. He’s just doing 
a lot more different activities off 
the court and getting after us in 
practice also.

TMD: Coach Jordan has said 

he’s always willing to talk about 
his career. Are there any stories 
that have stuck to you or your 
teammates?

MM: Yeah, man — him 

making it to the Final Four in 
’76. He just talks about that all 
the time. He says anything is 
possible, so we’re just trying to 
work hard and get there one day.

TMD: In 1976, Rutgers lost 

to Michigan in the Final Four. 
Since you play Michigan twice 
this year, do you think he might 
bring that up, try to rev you up 
before those games?

MM: Yeah, I’m sure he will. 

He doesn’t bring it up that often, 
but I’m sure on that occasion 
he will bring it up just to put 
something in our heads about 
the opportunity.

TMD: What’s the goal for 

this year?

MM: Of course, the goal is to 

make the NCAA Tournament, 
just like every college team. 
We’re just trying to get as many 
wins as we can. That’s all we 
can really worry about right 
now.

Michigan improves 
in conference debut

By CINDY YU 

Daily Sports Writer

From the uneven bars to the 

balance beam and the floor exer-
cise to the vault, the No. 4 Michi-
gan women’s gymnastics team 
showed improvements on each 
event in its first Big Ten meet.

The Wolverines hit all 24 of 

their routines on Saturday, took 
home top honors on every event 
and swept the podium in the all-
around competition. Senior Sachi 
Sugiyama and freshman Brianna 
Brown scored their career-best 
totals of 39.450 and 39.375 to 
place first and third, respectively. 
Sophomore Nicole Artz finished 
second with a score of 39.400.

Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 3-0 

overall) scored 196.975 to defeat 
No. 20 Ohio State (195.025) and 
West Virginia (194.175) at St. 
John Arena in Columbus.

Though the margin of victory 

may not seem significant, the 
improvements in scores don’t 
begin to do their performances 
justice. At No. 10 Georgia last 
weekend, the Wolverines tallied 
196.600 to set their highest-scor-
ing season opener in program 
history.

Michigan started out on bars, 

an event in which the six com-
petitors in the lineup swept the 
top six spots.

Freshman Nichelle Christo-

pherson set the tone for the rest 
of the lineup by leading off on 
uneven bars. Her score of 9.825 
matched the performance of 
junior Briley Casanova in the 
anchor position.

Sandwiched in between their 

routines, Sugiyama and Artz 
both scored 9.850 to improve 
upon their scores from the pre-
vious week. Brown — named Big 
Ten Freshman of the Week for 
the second consecutive week — 
set a career-best 9.875 on bars 
to rank among the top 20 in the 
country. Junior Lindsay Wil-
liams also topped her career high 
by earning a 9.925.

After the first rotation, Michi-

gan led the Buckeyes and the 
Mountaineers 49.325 to 48.900 

and 48.725, respectively.

Beam 
was 
an 
especially 

impressive event for the Wol-
verines. Michigan’s 49.225 score 
propelled it to the top nationl 
ranking for the event.

A West Chester, Ohio native 

making her homecoming to the 
state, Brown led the team with a 
career-high 9.875 routine.

“As a freshman, Brianna con-

tinues to just impress me tremen-
dously,” Plocki said. “She’s proven 
to be a really dynamic competitor 
and very, very consistent.”

In her return to the beam line-

up, Casanova led off with a score 
of 9.800.

Sugiyama scored her career-

best 9.850 in just her second 
competition on the beam since 
freshman year.

“Sachi has really just come 

into her own this year,” Plocki 
said. “She just competes with so 
much more aggressiveness and 
confidence than she had when 
she came in as a freshman.”

Artz and her sophomore coun-

terpart Talia Chiarelli tied Sugi-
yama in back-to-back routines, 
with both currently tied for No. 
7 in the NCAA standings on the 
event.

Just like the bars squad, the 

entire Michigan floor lineup 
in the six-up five-count format 
placed in the top six. The scores 
escalated throughout the night, 
with Williams leading off with a 
9.800 routine and Artz capping 
the rotation by tying her career 
high with a score of 9.950.

“My favorite part of compet-

ing is cheering on the sidelines of 
floor,” Brown said. “I love doing 
everybody else’s routines and 
then cheering them on, giving 
out high fives and seeing their 
faces at the end of their routines. 
They’re just so happy and there’s 
such raw emotion. It’s unlike 
anything I’ve ever seen.”

Heading into the final rota-

tion, Michigan led by over a point 
with a total of 147.800.

On vault, Sugiyama highlight-

ed the event with a stuck Yurch-
enko 1.5 in the anchor position, 
earning her a 9.925 score.

‘M’ looks to create energy

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Writer

COLUMBUS — When senior 

forward Zach Hyman scored 
his second goal of the game 5:36 
into the first period to give the 
Michigan hockey team a 2-0 
lead, the celebratory banging 
of gloves and sticks was heard 
loud and clear even from the 
highest parts of the building. 
The rest of Value City Arena 
was shockingly quiet.

The 
fans 
in 
Columbus— 

all 
8,156 
of 
them 
— 
had 

been silenced early. For the 
Wolverines, that meant mission 
accomplished.

“I think it was huge,” said 

sophomore 
forward 
Tyler 

Motte. “We’re just trying to 
focus on our system and play 
our game every night, no matter 
what building we’re in and no 
matter what energy there is.

“We’re trying to create our 

own energy.”

The 10-6 win at Ohio State 

marked the start of an eight-
game road trip for No. 16 
Michigan. The stretch away 
from home comes after playing 
11 of 12 games in Southeast 
Michigan — two in Detroit for 

the Great Lakes Invitational 
and nine at the friendly confines 
of Yost Ice Arena.

The lone trip outside of the 

state was to Boston, where the 
Wolverines fell to then-No. 16 
Boston College, 5-1 — the team’s 
only loss since Nov. 21.

After starting the season 1-5 

on the road, the Wolverines 
needed to start fast in the 
unfamiliar environment Friday. 
Thanks to the early offensive 
execution, the 10-6 win showed 
that the Wolverines are capable 
of doing just that.

“Zach got us out to a good 

start,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “With (Friday)’s 
game, you could say we won 
the game and we scored a lot of 
goals, but we gave up six goals.

“Had they scored the first 

two or three goals and we had 
to play catch-up in this building, 
it could’ve been a different 
outcome.”

Behind 
Hyman’s 
goals, 

Michigan hushed the crowd. 
With 
two 
more 
goals 
in 

the 
period, 
the 
Wolverines 

successfully sucked the life 
from the stands, leaving only 
their own energy to control the 
game.

But in the third period, three 

consecutive 
Buckeye 
scores 

evaporated Michigan’s five-goal 
lead and brought the remaining 
fans to their feet. It was a 
crude glimpse for Michigan of 
what can happen when it plays 
passively on the road.

“It’s a game of momentum 

too,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“We 

had momentum for parts of 
the game, but when they had 
momentum, 
it 
was 
really 

obvious.

“We 
didn’t 
like 
the 

momentum and the way things 
were going — the puck was 
going in too easy.”

Friday, the Wolverines travel 

to Madison, where they haven’t 
won since 2006. Though the 
Badgers are just 2-13-3 on the 
season, Michigan players know 
that 
come 
conference 
play, 

there simply are no breaks on 
the road.

“We 
got 
the 
bounces 

(Friday),” Motte said. “But it’s 
easy to see that game going the 
other way if we didn’t get that 
extra bounce or two.

“Obviously, we’ve got to find 

a way to win on the road if we’re 
going to compete in the Big 
Ten.”

Wolverines claw back to 
top Wildcats on road

Michigan’s strong 
second half erases 

early deficit for 
first road win

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

After just three minutes, the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team was down 9-0, and it 
seemed like the Wolverines’ 
road woes traveled with them to 
Evanston.

But tonight was different.
This time, the home team’s 

lead 
evaporated 
before 

the 
Wolverines 
took 
an 

insurmountable lead en route to 
a 73-66 win over Northwestern 
on Saturday night.

Unlike at Rutgers, where the 

Wolverines closed a 19-point 
deficit to zero before going 
behind again, Michigan took 
the lead in the second half and 
never looked back.

But it was the defense that 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico attributed most to the 
comeback.

“It 
really 

started 
with 

our defense,” 
Barnes Arico 
said. “In the 
first 
half, 

they went up 
early and we 
switched our 
defense 
and 

kind of slowed 
them down a 
little bit.”

The 
Wolverines 
started 

out the game playing a full-
court 
press, 
which 
worked 

successfully against opponents 
such as Michigan State and, at 
times, Ohio State.

But the Wildcats were ready 

for the defense and broke the 
press early and often with top 
scorers Maggie Lyon and Nia 
Coffey getting easy buckets in 
transition.

So Barnes Arico changed up 

her defense to the only thing 
that would keep the top scorers 
in check: half-court man-to-
man defense.

And it worked like a charm, 

with Coffey finishing with just 
six points.

“Early, we tried to press them 

and they broke that and got a 
bunch of baskets in transition,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Then we 
tried to go 2-3 on misses, and 
we really weren’t able to locate 
the scorers in transition. So we 
just played half-court man, and 
it was effective for us.”

On the other end of the court, 

senior guard Shannon Smith 
and sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson led the way with 
20 points apiece. But the way 
each obtained their points was 
different.

Smith scored most of her 

points in transition, including 
an acrobatic layup late in the 

first half that 
awed even the 
Northwestern 
bench.

“(Smith 

has) 
been 

incredible,” 
Barnes Arico 
said. 
“She’s 

been 
playing 

at 
another 

level. We want 
the ball in her 

hands when the shot clock is 
running down because she’s 
able to make some big plays for 
us.”

For Thompson, she stuck 

with her bread and butter: the 
3-point shot.

On a night where freshman 

guard Katelynn Flaherty — 
Michigan’s 
leading 
scorer 

— went 0-for-5 from behind 
the arc, Thompson excelled, 
hitting five of nine 3-point shots 
including key shots at the ends 
of both halves.

Down low, senior forward 

Cyesha Goree was her usual self 
and led the way for the bigs with 
16 points. But senior forward 
Nicole Elmblad led the team in 
rebounds with nine.

While Michigan still has a 

tough schedule ahead with the 
bulk of the Big Ten schedule 
still remaining, a win over a 
team undefeated at home will 
do wonders for a team that has 
struggled on the road.

“Anytime you have a win 

against a really good opponent, 
it gives you confidence,” Barnes 
Arico said. “If you can do it on 
the road, even better, and if you 
can do it and play well like we 
did in the second half tonight, I 
think it’s definitely going to help 
us moving forward.”

Najarian closes 
out home victory

Freshman not 
fazed by late 

tension

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Alex Najarian’s serve was on 

fire.

After a barrage of aces, her 

opponent from South Florida, 
Olga Martinez, tried to use a 
common stall tactic: icing the 
server.

Fans at the Varsity Tennis 

Center 
groaned 
after 
her 

opponent 
took 
what 
they 

thought was too long to search 
for a rogue ball. Fresh off a 
couple 
of 
aces, 
Michigan’s 

freshman standout was unfazed 
by the wait.

Najarian had to fight through 

her emotional opponent. After 
winning the first set handily, 
6-1, Najarian battled to win the 
second set of her last match of 
the tournament, 7-5.

Martinez yelled either with 

jubilation or disappointment 
after 
every 
point. 
Najarian 

simply smiled to the crowd as 
it whispered about Martinez’s 
antics. Najarian later jokingly 
called her opponent’s tactics 
annoying, but said she respected 
her play.

“She started playing better by 

picking up her game a little bit, 
and I backed off when she was 
doing so,” Najarian said. “I just 
needed to step it up a little more 
and take control of the points. 
I did that in the end, which 
helped me.”

Najarian has been working on 

being more aggressive since the 
fall, and it showed on Monday. 
Her overheads and serves were 
noticeably powerful, keeping 
her opponents off balance. She 
picked up aces at crucial times, 
especially in her last match.

“She’s kind of changed the 

way she’s played from the (ITA) 
Juniors,” said Michigan coach 

Ronni Bernstein. “She was a 
little more defensive and (now) 
she’s coming forward more.”

Najarian, 
a 
three-time 

state 
champion, 
three-time 

All-American and last year’s 
Michigan High School Athlete 
of the Year, has already made an 
impact on the team. She went 
undefeated over the weekend 
in both singles (playing at the 
No. 3, 4 and 5 positions) and 
doubles, where she is in the No. 
1 position and ranked No. 10 in 
the nation.

Her success in both makes it 

tough for even Najarian herself 
to decide where she excels more. 
But she does have a preference.

“I 
like 
doubles 
better,” 

Najarian said. “I like having 
another person out there.”

Although 
team 
points 

weren’t scored in the Michigan 
Invitational, 
Najarian 
will 

certainly 
contribute 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ 
success 
as 
the 

season progresses.

“She’s come a long way in 

four months. She’s been doing 
a great job and has been a great 
addition,” Bernstein said. “She’s 
going to compete day in and day 
out, and that’s all I can ask for.”

Najarian lost only one singles 

match in her entire high school 
career. The college game isn’t 
much different, but it comes 
with heightened competition 
and pressure. Though Najarian 
has 
tweaked 
her 
playing 

technique and strategy to be 
more successful at the college 
level, Bernstein has the utmost 
confidence in her to achieve.

“She’s hopefully going to get 

more confidence in what she’s 
doing,” Bernstein said. “She’s 
playing more different and 
offensive, and hopefully the 
results will come.”

As 
Najarian’s 
confidence 

grows, she and the team will 
improve and learn, for this year 
and the years to come. At the 
same time, her opponents will 
learn something as well: You 
can’t ice Alex Najarian.

Coon, Murphy strong in defeat

Michigan can’t 
overcome early 
deficit in loss to 

Ohio State

By OLIVER HENRY

For the Daily

Brian Murphy raised his 

arms in triumph. He overcame 
the odds and beat his nationally 
ranked competitor as the sold-
out crowd in Cliff Keen Arena 
erupted in cheers.

In spite of Murphy’s efforts, 

though, the Michigan wrestling 
team dropped its home opener to 
No. 4 Ohio State by a total score 
of 25-15. Despite surging after 
intermission, the Wolverines 
were unable to climb back into 
the match and earn the victory.

Ohio State (2-1 Big Ten, 7-3 

overall) boasts a catalog of 
highly ranked wrestlers who 
dominated Michigan early in 
the bout. In three successive 
fights, the Buckeyes posted two 
majority decisions and a pin to 
jump out to an early 15-0 lead.

From 
there, 
Ohio 
State 

cruised to a victory, as the 
Wolverines 
were 
visibly 

demoralized.

But all was not lost for 

Michigan, as it salvaged a few 
prized victories.

Sophomore Brian Murphy 

was one of the Wolverines’ 
bright spots, improving his 
personal record to 14-6 and 
taking down the No. 5 wrestler 
in the country in the 157-pound 
weight class. During the match, 
Murphy and his opponent, Josh 
Demas, remained even through 
the first period.

But at the beginning of the 

second period, Murphy chose to 
begin in the down position and 
escaped Demas’ hold to earn 
himself a point and the lead. 
Murphy surged to a 3-1 lead 
with a takedown entering the 
third period before he decisively 
earned his team three points 
with a powerful takedown.

“Before the match I try to tell 

myself if I get a lead, I gotta score 
again,” Murphy said. “So I put 

the match away, and it felt really 
good to get that last takedown.”

Murphy’s 
victory 
is 
an 

example of the kind of grit and 
determination that Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland has tried 
to instill in all his wrestlers. He 
firmly believes that toughness 
and 
determination 
are 
the 

key contributors to success in 
wrestling matches.

“We’ve got 

to have that 
toughness 
in 
those 

moments,” 
McFarland 
said. “We have 
got to be the 
ones firing off 
those shots.”

Other 

shining 
moments 
in 

the defeat for Michigan (1-2, 
3-3) 
were 
majority-decision 

victories by freshman Alec 
Pantaleo 
and 
sophomore 

Domenic 
Abounader. 
Both 

wrestlers fought for six tireless 
minutes to earn victories and 
a combined six points for the 
Wolverines.

But 
the 
most 
impressive 

performance of the night for 

Michigan came from sophomore 
captain Adam Coon.

After a disappointing outing 

for the Wolverines throughout 
the day, the heavyweight was 
the last to step on the mat. And 
he did not disappoint, putting 
on a clinic instead.

Coon quickly earned two 

points by taking down his 
opponent, and with still 1:22 

left in just the 
first 
period, 

he 
secured 

a pin to give 
Michigan 
15 

total 
points 

for the match. 
Coon, ranked 
No. 8 in his 
weight 
class, 

improved 
to 

19-2 
in 
his 

career 
after 

the victory.

“Coon’s 
approach 
is 

everything, 
bottom 
line 
— 

just the way he approaches 
his academics, the way he 
approaches our workouts, our 
training and his competitions,” 
McFarland said. “He’s great in 
all those areas, and he’s really 
focused and he’s got a lot of 
character, too.”

Despite 
a 
few 
hard-

fought 
victories, 
the 
team 

was 
underwhelmed 
by 
its 

performance.

“I feel like we didn’t get the 

job done today, but I feel like 
our team is capable of beating 
these 
guys,” 
said 
Murphy. 

“But we have some even better 
opponents coming up, so we just 
gotta prepare like we always 
have.”

McFarland, 
in 
particular, 

was unhappy with the effort 
and toughness his wrestlers put 
forth on the mat.

“If you want to beat a team 

like Ohio State in Cliff Keen 
Arena, you better be able to lay 
it on the line, and you better 
be able to really gut out an 
incredible 
performance 
to 

win 
those 
tough 
matches,” 

McFarland said. “That’s what 
it takes to win a national 
championship, that’s what it 
takes to be an All-American, 
and that’s what it takes to win a 
Big Ten title.”

While Michigan’s loss to Ohio 

State sets it back on its quest for 
a conference championship, the 
Wolverines will get a chance to 
right the ship on Friday when 
Wisconsin comes to town.

Sophomore forward Tyler Motte scored two goals and added an assist in Michigan’s 10-goal outburst at Ohio State.

LeVert (foot) out for season

Junior will have 
surgery this week

By MAX BULTMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Junior guard Caris LeVert 

will miss the remainder of the 
season with a left foot injury, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
announced Sunday.

LeVert went down hard after 

clearing a rebound to seal the 
Wolverines’ 
56-54 
win 
over 

Northwestern Saturday night, 
and MLive.com reported LeVert 
had been seen on crutches 
following the game.

“Caris has been working so 

hard this season and for this to 
happen is very unfortunate,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein in 
a press release Sunday. “If we 
know anything about Caris, he 
will do everything it takes to 
not only get better, but to help 
his teammates during this time. 
He is a tremendous young man 
who I will really miss coaching 
the remainder of the season. 

However, I am optimistic he will 
have a complete recovery.”

The press release stated that 

LeVert will have surgery this 
week and will undergo a 12-week 
recovery period. LeVert also had 
surgery on his left foot in May 
2014.

LeVert 
was 
leading 
the 

Wolverines in scoring with 14.9 
points per game, rebounding 
with 4.8 boards per contest and 
averaged 3.7 assists in a team-
high 35.8 minutes per game.

In the press release, LeVert 

emphasized his confidence in the 
Wolverines to build on their 4-2 
record in Big Ten play, as well as 
his own recovery process.

“While this is obviously not 

what I wanted, I know this team 
will come together and be stronger 
because of it,” LeVert said. “Now 
more than ever, it is important for 
all of us support this team. For me, 
I am familiar with the recovery 
process and what work lies ahead 
for me. I am very confident that I 
will return 100 percent and have 
already begun work to ensure that 
happens.”

LUNA ANNA ARCHEY/Daily

Caris LeVert leads Michigan in points, rebounds, assists, minutes and steals.

In need of a 

miracle

M

iracles happen.

Just ask the 

1980 United States 

Olympic 
hockey team, 
or the 1982-
83 North 
Carolina 
State 
basketball 
team. Better 
yet, just ask 
anyone who 
has seen 
Full-Court 
Miracle.

The movie follows the 

journey of Philadelphia Hebrew 
Academy, which has the 
worst basketball team in the 
history of the sport. It enters 
a tournament without a coach 
but has surprising success, 
reaching the final against the 
school’s biggest rival.

There’s a major storm on 

the night of the championship, 
and the power goes out at the 
school, so 
officials use 
a generator 
to keep the 
lights on, 
with an 
agreement 
that 
whichever 
team is 
ahead when 
the gym 
goes dark wins. In a miracle of 
miracles, the generator restarts 
despite having run out of gas, 
and the Philadelphia Hebrew 
Academy ekes out a buzzer-
beating win.

It’s a classic feel-good 

story of a group of ragtag 
underdogs overcoming the 
odds to accomplish greatness 
through wild and improbable 
circumstances.

Right now, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team 
needs a Full-Court Miracle. 
Unfortunately for the 
Wolverines, the power grid at 
Crisler Center is doing just fine.

* * *

J

ohn Beilein is a 
great coach, but the 
circumstances facing him 

today are remarkably difficult.

The Wolverines have more 

injured or sick players (seven) 
than healthy ones (six). Their 
best player, Caris LeVert, 
is done for the year with a 
fractured bone in his foot. 
Their starting point guard, 
Derrick Walton Jr., couldn’t 
practice Sunday due to a toe 
injury. Their backup forward, 
Kameron Chatman, injured 
his knee that day in practice. 
Zak Irvin, Ricky Doyle and 
Spike Albrecht — who is also 
already nursing an unspecified 
midsection injury — are 
suffering from an illness.

Turn on your TV for 

Tuesday’s game against 
Rutgers, and you’ll see plenty of 
unfamiliar faces on the court. 
Players such as Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman and Aubrey 
Dawkins might need to accept 
starting roles, while former 
walk-on Sean Lonergan could 
see major time. How crazy is 
that?

It’s mid-January, and 

Michigan is clinging to its 
NCAA Tournament hopes. 
Tuesday is a must-win game, 
but it’s on the road, and the 
Wolverines may only dress 
eight players.

Can they do it?

* * *

D

oyle, Chatman and 
Irvin should all return 
to complete health 

this year. Albrecht and Walton 
probably won’t, but at least 
they’ll play.

But LeVert isn’t coming 

back this season. He might 
not ever play another game 
in a Michigan uniform. And 
that’s a shame, because this 
was his year, and this was his 
team. That’s what he said on 
Oct. 16 at Big Ten Media Day, 
when losing to New Jersey 
Institute of Technology or 
Eastern Michigan seemed 
unfathomable.

“(My role) is to be the 

leader of the team, one of the 
captains,” he said. “Hopefully 
me and Spike can really take on 
that role.”

And he had from the very 

beginning of the season. 
He scored 20 points against 
Hillsdale, 21 against Detroit, 18 
against Oregon and 16 against 
Syracuse.

But then the NJIT game 

happened, and it started a 
four-game losing streak. 
LeVert didn’t score more than 
10 points in the final three. 
And when Big Ten play began, 
Michigan suffered deflating 
defeats at Purdue and Ohio 
State.

And as the season 

progressed, it became obvious: 
LeVert was everything. Stop 
him, and you’ll stop Michigan. 
If he gets hot, well, watch out.

LeVert saved the game 

for Michigan on Saturday. 
Northwestern’s Alex Olah, the 

7-foot center, 
had boxed 
him out, and 
yet the guard 
managed to 
tip away a 
contested 
rebound. 
Had he 
not made 
the play, 
Olah could 

have scored on a putback at 
the buzzer, and maybe the 
Wolverines would’ve lost in 
overtime. But LeVert knocked 
the ball away, then went 
tumbling to the ground in pain 
as the celebration began around 
him.

Without LeVert, the 

Wolverines are a “wounded 
animal,” as Rutgers coach 
Eddie Jordan explained 
Monday. Michigan is trapped 
in a corner, and its only hope 
for survival is scratching and 
clawing to escape.

This was LeVert’s team, and 

it was struggling plenty with 
him. Now it has to move on 
without him.

* * *

E

xpectations for the 
2014-15 Wolverines 
have been adjusted 

from competing for the Big 
Ten title, to making the NCAA 
Tournament, to simply treading 
water and developing players 
for next year.

Michigan can’t succeed this 

season, right? Not now, not 
with so many freshmen and 
unproven players.

But remember: In 2011, 

the Wolverines broke a six-
game losing streak by beating 
Michigan State at the Breslin 
Center. Then they came within 
a basket of making the Sweet 
Sixteen.

Remember: In 2012, 

Michigan won a Big Ten title 
with Stu Douglass and Zack 
Novak starting a majority of 
games.

Remember: In 2013, Mitch 

McGary transformed from an 
underperforming, out-of-shape 
freshman into a potential NBA 
first-round pick over the course 
of a handful of games in March 
as he helped lead Michigan 
to the national championship 
game.

The challenges facing this 

team are much larger than 
anything the Wolverines 
have faced lately. They 
need several key road wins 
available, beginning Tuesday 
in Piscataway. They need three 
or four players, including 
several freshmen, to make 
in-season leaps to greatness; 
and they need a new leader, a 
more efficient offense and a less 
porous defense.

It would take a near-miracle 

for this team — led by a pair 
of hobbled guards and a duo 
of developing centers — to 
make the NCAA Tournament. 
It would be Beilein’s best 
coaching job yet. It would be 
worthy of a Disney movie.
