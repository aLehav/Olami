Obama bestows
retiring rep. with
Presidential Medal
of Freedom
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
President Barack Obama
announced Monday that he will
award U.S. Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.) the Presidential Medal,
of Freedom, the highest civilian
award an American citizen can
win.
After 58 years of representing
Southeast Michigan in Washing-
ton, D.C., Dingell officially became
the longest-serving member of
congress in history last year. His
district comprises Ann Arbor,
Ypsilanti, much of Downriver
Detroit and other townships in
Southeast Michigan. Dingell will
retire next year, and his wife Deb-
bie Dingell, currently a Wayne
State University trustee and for-
mer General Motors lobbyist, was
elected last week to succeed him.
She will be the third consecutive
member of the Dingell family to be
elected to Congress, as John Ding-
ell's father served from 1932 until
his death in 1955.
In a statement on his Facebook
page Monday evening, Dingell said
he was humbled by the recogni-
tion.
"There are few words that could

accurately describe my thoughts
and feelings in receiving this won-
derful honor," he said. "It is espe-
cially meaningful to me to receive
this recognition alongside such a
distinguished and diverse group
of individuals thattrulyrepresents
the ideals and values that have
made this nation great."
Dingell's stance-in Congresshas
been characterized as moderate
andliberal. He is staunchdefender
of the environment, having helped
pen historic legislation such as the
Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act
and National Environmental Pol-
icy Act. He also advocated for the
Affordable Care Act.
More recently, in a January
interview with The Michigan
Daily, Dingell discussed the need
to ease college students' struggles
with student loans and raise the
minimum wage.
"That's one of the biggest prob-
lems when I talk to the people I
see and serve," Dingell said on the
topic ofstudent loan debt.
The Presidential Medal of Free-
dom was established in 1963 to
honor those who have contributed
to "the security or national inter-
ests of the United States, or world
peace, or cultural or other signifi-
cant public or private endeavors."
As of Nov. 20, 2013, the last update
of the Medal'swebsite, Obamahad
awarded 61 medals.
Previous recipients of this
award under Obama include for-
mer President Bill Clinton, scien-
tist Steven Hawking, former South

Driver training
protocols doubled
over past year
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Since June,two members ofthe
University community - a student
and a staff member - have died
from University bus accident-
related injuries, raising concerns
about the safety policies in place
for University drivers.
With a total of six bus-related
accidents, deaths or instances of
negligencehavingoccurred inthe
last year and a half, a spokesper-

son at the University's Parking and
Transportation Services said they
are always working to improve
their methods of instructing driv-
ers - including the implemen-
tation of a three-phase training
system last April - to ensure that
drivers are well equipped to oper-
ate transit vehicles. -
In October, a University bus hit
24-year-old engineering graduate
student Derek Tat while he was on
his bike.In June, University Hous-
ing employee Nancy Sanders was
hit by a University bus and died
from the resulting injuries.
Last year, there were four bus-
related incidents of driver error.
In September 2013, a University
bus crashed into and destroyed an

unoccupied bus shelter on the cor-
ner of Fuller Street and Bonisteel
Boulevard, and during that same
month, three students fell out of
the back of a University bus on
its way to Michigan Stadium. In
October 2013, a University bus
got stuck in a turnaround next
to the Michigan Union. Then, in
November 2013, a University bus
driver was arrested for driving his
vehicle off-route and abandoning
it while he went into his house for
severalihours.
JeffBidwell,whobecame direc-
tor of PTS in April2013, said train-
ing protocols have doubled since
then so that incidents like those
thathave occurredinthe pastyear
and a half can be avoided.

"My first priority was to look
at how we were doing training
and see if there was anything we
could improve or revise," he said.
Driver training is now a three-
phase process: First, a potential
driver learns to maneuver the
vehicle without passengers. Then
he or she has to complete in-
service training, which involves
operating routes and picking up
passengers alongside a licensed
driver. A third party administers a
commercial driver's license exam,
and if the potential driver passes,
then he or she returnsfor any final
additional training, if needed.

 Annual NASCO
conference celebrates
history of cooperative
living arrangements
By LINDSEY SCALLEY
For the Daily
It was a cooperative presen-
tation, so the audience partici-
pated.
"What brought you folks to
co-ops? Just shout some stuff
out," said Nikki Marin Baena, a
keynote speaker and co-founder
of Cooperation Texas, a non-
profit dedicated to creating sus-
tainable employment for those
affected by social and economic
inequality.
The audience members were
quick to respond.
"Community."
"Necessity."
"Affordable housing."
"Economic justice."
"Control."
"Food."
"Kindness."
Last weekend, from Nov. 7 to
Nov. 9, 405 cooperative mem-
bers from across the United

States and Canada, about 30 of
whom came from Ann Arbor
co-ops, descended on the
Michigan Union for the North
American Students of Coop-
eration Institute, a conference
held yearly in Ann Arbor since
1977.
They came to network with
other co-ops, share ideas and
skills, and further the coop-
erative movement, a historical
movement working to return
ownership to the people. Co-ops
are houses, frequently located
near college campuses, where
residents are required to share
the responsibility for cooking,
cleaning and other household
activities.
"This principle about co-ops,
that we can decide what kind
of a world we want to have and
shape it for ourselves, is a really
big thing," Baena said.
Before and after the keynote
address, however, co-opers
lined the hallways of the Union,
occupied Au Bon Pain and Star-
bucks and wandered through
the makeshift bookshop in the
Art Lounge, which was filled
with coffee, art, buttons and 300
pounds of chocolate donated by

By TOM MCBRIEN

Amid statewide and national
clashes between nurses' unions,
hospital systems and state
governments on the issue, the
Michigan Nurses Association

and the University of Michigan
Health System have negotiated
a contract to offer specific Ebola
protections to nurses should the
need arise.
The contract, signed Monday
between the MNA, the largest
nurses association in the state,
and UMHS, the largest hospi-
tal system in the state, outlines
specific regulations for personal
protective equipment, referred
to as PPE, and safety training for
Ebola preparation for all UMHS

nurses. It also outlines the mea-
sures of job and salary security
that nurses who may have to
undergo quarantine or treat-
ment for Ebola can expect.

Settlement fund set up

$14 million set aside
for victims of
2005 hurricane
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -
More than nine years after
the levees broke during Hur-
ricane Katrina and flooded
New Orleans, residents and
businesses finally can ask for
some compensation - albeit
small - from a $14 million
settlement fund set up to pay
for the catastrophic flood.
The payouts, though, will
be meager and far from what
residents may have hoped for
after their city was devastated
in 2005.
Hopes for hefty damage
payments were dashed in
the years after the hurricane
when lawsuits suing the Army
Corps of Engineers were
defeated in federal court. The

courts held that the federal
agency was protected from
liability by a 1928 law that
gave the agency immunity
from suits seeking damages
over failed flood-control proj-
ects.
This money comes from
a separate settlement that
plaintiffs' lawyers reached in
2009 with three levee boards
in New Orleans, Jefferson
Parish and St. Bernard Parish.
The levee boards were respon-
sible in part for the upkeep of
the structures that broke dur-
ing Katrina.
Under this settlement, resi-
dents, businesses and people
visiting the city when Katrina
struck can apply now for com-
pensation. The money comes
from insurance policies the
levee boards had at the time
of Katrina. Claims must be
filed by April 30, 2015. A fed-
eral judge recently gave his

approval to how the money
can be divided.
Gerald Meunier, a New
Orleans lawyer who helped
handle the class-action law-
suits over the flood, said the
settlement is as much money
as can be gotten from the
boards' insurance policies.
He added that'under the law,
the levee boards' assets could
not be seized.
"We can't get a dime more
from the levee districts,"
Meunier said. "It's obviously
not enough. It can never make
up for everything people went
through."
He said the plaintiffs'
lawyers did everything they
could to win more for the
city's residents, but that the
federal courts affirmed the
Corps' immunity.
Residents and businesses

Bernard and Jefferson are eli-

gioie ror money.

-U

The size of the payouts
will depend on how many
claims are filed. For instance,
if 200,000 claims are paid,
a homeowner whose prop-
erty was flooded by 4 feet of
water could expect to receive
4 $463. But if 800,000 claims
are paid, then the same home-
6 owner could expect $116.
People also can claim com-
pensation for the death of a
family member. Claims for
deaths will receive between
9 $255 and $1,020.
After lawyer and admin-
istrative costs are factored
in, there will be about $14
million left for residents and
businesses. Lawyers who han-
dled the case are expected to
divide up $3.5 million among
themselves to pay for costs
they incurred. The lawyers
who handled the case waived
their fees. In all, the lawyers
say they spent more than $13
million on litigating the cases.
"We took a beating," said
Joseph Bruno, a plaintiffs'
lawyer.

Collaboration
raises awareness of
available resources
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
The University's chapters of
Students for Life and Students
for Choice have found an issue
worth coming together to sup-
port. In partnership with the
Dean of Students Office, the two
groups are creating a website
set to be released by the end of
the semester that will showcase
resources for undergraduate stu-
dent parents.
The idea came about after a
campus visit by Sally Winn, vice
president of Feminists for Life.
The central theme in Winn's
speech was her frustration with
the lack of campus resources for
student parents.
After the speech, LSA senior
Taylor Crookston, Students
for Life interim vice president,
said he was approached by Stu-
dents for Choice about working
together to improve resources
on campus for student parents.
Crookston said the collabo-
ration was intended to better
organize the current resources
available to students with kids.
"Right now, this collabo-
ration between Students for
Life and Students for Choice
is trying to just get what
resources are available very
clear," Crookston said. "There
are more resources than peo-
ple know about, but there is
nowhere for people to really
find out about them."
LSA senior Sophia Kotov,
president of Students for
Choice, said student parents
and pregnant students lack a
community at the University.
"It's really, really hard to
have a child on campus espe-
cially because you don't see
other people on campus who
have children," Kotov said. "If
you don't know anybody else

who is in the situation, you
would feel so alone."
Though a discussion group
for parenting students previ-
ously existed on campus, apart
from a Facebook group, it has
since disbanded.
Rachel Naasko directs the
Blavin Scholars Program, a
division of -Student Life that
works to promote the success of
University students who were
formerly in foster care. She is
a Critical Incident Coordina-
tor, whichsupports students in
difficult situations, and serves
as the Dean of Students Office
administrator helping establish
the new website.
Naasko emphasized that the
website supports both pregnant
students and students already
caringfor children.
"The website will be tailored
toward undergraduate student
parents, not exclusively stu-
dents who are pregnant," she
said. "We want to support all
students in whatever way they
come to campus, whether that
be students who come to cam-
pus with children to students
who have children while they
are on campus. We want those
resources to be in an accessible
way, which is really the issue
they brought forward."
The website is expected to
feature dadirectory of resourc-
es. It will likely provide links
to housing options for student
parents, University lactation
rooms, University Health Ser-
vice options for prenatal care
and other community-based
resources such as childbirth or
Lamaze classes.
Crookston said the groups
came together to give students
more options at the University.
"I don't think that students at
the University of Michigan have
any choice between abortion or
carrying the baby to term - and
then either givingit up for adop-
tion or raising it themselves
because of this institutional-
ized barrier that you don't see
any pregnant girls on campus

or rarely," Crookston said. "We
don't think there is that genu-
ine choice. It's either drop out
or have an abortion."
Naasko said the groups were
too focused on their common
goals to let conflict get in the
way.
"They, together, came for-
ward and identified an issue
that they had questions about
and were looking for more
information," Naasko said. "I
think because they had already
identified that together, there
wasn't a place for conflict. They
had already decided that this
was an issue they wanted to
create support for together."
Kotov said this experience
reminded her of the groups'
commonalities and how pro-
life and pro-choice are not a
dichotomy.
"Pro-life and pro-choice
aren't opposites. Not at all,"
Kotov said. "We have so many
common goals that we just kind
of forget about because we are
busy with this polemic rheto-
ric."
Naasko added that this part-
nership reflects University stu-
dents' desire to support fellow
students.
"It is a great example of how
Michigan students, who appear
to have very different ideas and
feelings, can come together to
support other Wolverines. I'm
glad to hear that their expe-
rience has also been fairly
smooth. I think the circum-
stance could have been very
different," Naasko said.
Crookston said the website
will be unbiased and will not
showcase any pro-life or pro-
choice arguments.
"Our goal is to make our Uni-
versity a more inclusive place
for pregnant and parenting stu-
dents, for women who do want
to have the choice to carry their
pregnancy to term," Crookston
said. "We have really avoided,
honestly, abortion as a topic in
regards to the website."

Ballroom dance team,
sees major growth

Sole U.S. Ebola patient
scheduled to be released

Group welcomes
almost 150 new
students this year
By TANYA MADHANI
Daily Staff Reporter
Inside the Central Campus
Recreation Building late on a
Monday night, the familiar lyrics
to British '80s pop duo Euryth-
mics' hit song "Sweet Dreams"
permeate the halls. The source of
the sound is the University's Ball-
room Dance Team, a permanent
Monday, Thursday and Saturday
night fixture in the facility's Mir-
ror Room.
LSA junior Brianna ' Mayer,
the team's public relations chair,
leads a group of 60 new team
members through a lesson on the
perfect promenade form along-
side her partner, LSA senior Ter-
rence Tigney. Mayer and Tigney
demonstrate a foxtrot step to the
onlooking students encircling
them - boys on one side and girls
on the other.
"One, two, three, four," Mayer
calls out, moving in time with her
partner.
After two more demonstra-
tions, the two halves of the room
combine to form 30 couples.
Mayer walks to the edge of the
room, where her phone is plugged
into a speaker, and restarts the
familiar foxtrot remix.
Couples clad in everything
from jeans to activewear, Latin
dance shoes to socks, imitate
Mayer and her partner as best
they can. A mix of inexperience
and space constraints result in
some couples bumping and run-
ning into each other.
Rackham student Jon Her-
shaff, team president, said the
club has had their biggest group
of incoming members ever this
year, with close to 150 new stu-
dents entering the collegiate ball-
room dance world.
The-team-which consists-of-
250 members, anticipates out-
growing the University's avail-
able practice space as soon as next
year.
"We're almost too big for a stu-
dentgroup," Hershaff said. "It can
be very difficult to be able to coor-
dinate classes and practices when
youjust have ateam of our size."
Hershaff said he attributes
the growth in interest to active
recruitment during Welcome
Week, during which the team
hosted free lessons in various
ballroom styles. They followed

up those events with dinners and
social activities to allow potential
members to learn about the club's
offerings.
Unlike many dance groups
at the University, the Ballroom
Dance Team does not have an
audition process to become a
member, nor does itrequire mem-
bers to attend every practice ses-
sion.
"You get out of it what you put
into it," Hershaff said. "If there's
some people who just want to get
their feet wet, they could put in
a couple of hours per week. For
people who want to go deeper, the
cap is usually 15 hours a week."
The team allows interested
students to enter the group at
the newcomer level for the first
semester. Members can then
audition for higher-level teams
within the group in every subse-
quent semester.
There are five competition
groups within the club. Try-
outs for these sub-teams last a
few hours in a . mock competi-
tion environment, where couples
are required to come dressed
in full competition attire as the
team's coaches - Steve and Susan
McFerran - judge and sort cou-
ples into respective groups.
A partner is not needed when
first joining the team, but one is
required to audition for a higher-
level. The team currently has
more women than men, causing
five women to enter their first
competition on Oct. 25 at Purdue
University partner-less.
Three blocks down from
where the newcomers are per-
fecting their foxtrot, experi-
enced team members practice in
the Dance Theatre Studio above
Moe Sport Shops on North Uni-
versity Avenue. DTS offers the
Ballroom Team discounted pric-
es for practice and lesson space
four days week in exchange for
services, such as cleaning their
studio.
DTS is much less crowded
than the-CCRB, with only a
handful of couples turning up
for practice. LSA junior Whitney
Raska, a member of the C-team,
said she enjoys the quieter prac-
tices after competitions, because
most people are still recovering
from an exhausting weekend of
travel and dance.
Raska and her partner, Engi-
neering junior Jake Snyder,
started dancing together in the
winter of 2013 and Raska said
due to the disproportionate ratio
of male and female members, she
felt rushed about finding some-

one to dance with for competi-
tions.
"There's always a shortage of
guys to girls," Raska said. "And
it really stinks if you don't (have
a partner) because you have to
dance by yourself, so I started
looking out for people who I
enjoyed dancing with and then
I just asked (Snyder) one night to
be my partner."
Because other boys on the
team initially advised him not
to rush into selecting a partner,
Snyder said, he didn't accept
Raska's offer right away.
"(This was) just to be sure that
we had the conversation with our
partner about whether we had
the same goals, the same com-
mitment level," he said. "Wheth-
er we had the same kind of
dreams from ballroom before we
said yes to a partner. So she will
tell you that I denied her at first,
but I'm going to call it deferring."
Hershaff said he sees picking
partners as being similar to dat-
ing.
"There's some people who just
want to jump right into a part-
nership, but what we try and
recommend is to ask someone to
practice first," he said. "That's
like going out to coffee together.
If you enjoy practicing together,
you ask them to go to a competi-
tion. That'd be like going out to a
dinner date.
"And if you enjoy that and you
want to stay together, you can ask
them to be your partner."
Partners on teams higher than
the newcomer level are locked in
for a semester, but members are
free to switch with a new semes-
ter if some couples do not com-
pete or get along well.
"Ideally you want to dance
with the same partner for mul-
tiple semesters, because then
youget to dance better together,"
Snyder said. "But if partnerships
don't work out, you're not locked
in for life. It'snot like you'remar-
rying somebody."
But newcomer-level partners
LSA junior John Cooper and LSA
freshman Ariel Odlum said they
have enjoyed their first compe-
tition together in Purdue this
weekend and hope to remain
partners for both semesters of
the year.
"(Ballroom) is a good way to
have an entry-level way to get
training, to get good at some-
thing that I can be proud of,"
Cooper said. "That's probably
the biggest (goal), to.get good at
dancingtogether and to compete
and win if we can."

N.Y. Department
of Health declares
ER doctor Craig
Spencer healthy
NEW YORK (AP) - An emer-
gency room doctor who was the
first Ebola patient in the nation's
biggest city has recovered and is
scheduled to be released from
the hospital on Tuesday, health
officials said.
Dr. Craig Spencer, who was
the only Ebola patient being
treated in the United States, has
been declared free of the virus,
the city Department of Health
said Monday in a statement.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said
Spencer has suffered a lot the
last few weeks but has "come
back really strong." He called
Spencer "a real hero."
"I'm sure he's a little weak-
ened from the experience," de
Blasio said, but he's "very, very
healthy."
Spencer tested positive for
the virus on Oct. 23, just days
after returning from treating
patients in Guinea with Doctors
Without Borders. He has been
treated in a specially designed
isolation unit at Manhattan's
Bellevue Hospital, a designated
Ebola treatment center. His
condition was upgraded from
serious to stable last week, and
he was feeling well enough to
request an exercise bike and a
banjo.
His fiancee and two friends

initially were quarantined but
were released and are being
monitored along with hundreds
of others.
Spencer, who's 33, is expected
to issue a statement but not take
questions when he's released
from the hospital.
Health officials have stressed
that Ebola is not airborne and
can only be spread through
direct contact with the bodily
fluids of an infected person
who is showing symptoms. Still,
news of Spencer's infection set
many New Yorkers on edge, par-
ticularly after details emerged
that he rode the subway, dined
in a meatball restaurant and vis-
ited a bowling alley in the days
before he developed a fever and
tested positive.
New York Gov. Andrew
Cuomo and New Jersey Gov.
Chris Christie responded by
announcing a mandatory 21-day
quarantine for travelers who
have come in close contact with
Ebola patients.
De Blasio and Cuomo
had urged residents not to
be alarmed by Spencer's
Ebola diagnosis, even as they
described him riding the sub-
way and taking a cab. De Blasio
has said all city officials fol-
lowed "clear and strong" pro-
tocols in their handling and
treatment of him and Spencer
did right by calling authorities
as soon as he got a fever.
Spencer may have been
aware of New Yorkers' fears
about his case but didn't dwell
on it, and he remained upbeat

about recovering even in the
worst of his illness, said de Bla-
sio, who spoke to him during his
hospitalization.
The Ebola epidemic in West
Africa has killed thousands of
people, but only a handful of
people has been diagnosed or
treated in the United States.
Those treated in the U.S.
also include American health
and aid workers and a journal-
ist who were in West Africa, a
Liberian man diagnosed with
the virus during a visit to Texas
and two nurses who contracted
it from him. The man, Thomas
Eric Duncan, died; the rest have
recovered.
Colleagues in Guinea have
said Spencer conscientiously
followed safety procedures in
place at the Doctors Without
Borders clinic in Gueckedou.
Spencer, anattending physi-
cian at NewYork-Presbyterian
Hospital/Columbia University
Medical Center, has traveled
around the world to care for the
needy. In the past three years,
he'd been to Rwanda to work
on an emergency care teaching
curriculum, volunteered at a
health clinic in Burundi, helped
investigate an infectious para-
sitic disease in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and traveled
to 32 villages in Indonesia to do
a public health survey.
Colleagues have said Spencer
has the ability to put patients at
ease even when he doesn't know
their language, winning them
over through hugs and smiles.

Hackers breach U.S. Postal
Service computer system

Sept. attack could
have compromised
sensitive employee
information
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
U.S. Postal Service said Monday
it had been hacked, potentially
compromising sensitive infor-
mation about its employees such
as names and addresses, Social
Security numbers, emergency
contacts and other information.
The FBI said it was leading a
multi-agency investigation into
the breach, which took effect in
mid-September. The intrusion
was similar to those reported by
other federal agencies as well as
in the private sector. The agency
isn't recommending that its cus-
tomers take any action.
"The intrusion is limited in
scope, and all operations of the
Postal Service are functioning
normally," said Postal Service
spokesman David Partenheimer.
He said that customers at
local post offices or those using
its website, usps.com, were not
affected, but that people who
used its call center may have
had telephone numbers, email
addresses and other information
compromised.
Partenheimer said the attacks
affected Postal Service workers
across the board, from the post-
master general to letter carriers

to those who work in the inspec-
tor general's office.
The Postal Service provided
no immediate information on
how many people may have been
affected. It said it employs over
800,000 workers.
Mark Dimondstein, president
of the American Postal Workers
Union, called the hacking "trou-
bling."
"We're starting to get feed-
back immediately. People are
concerned," Dimondstein said
in an interview.
He said that, so far, the hack-
ing "doesn't seem to have affect-
ed the public at all and doesn't
seem to have affected credit
cards, bank accounts and things
like that."
"What we don't know is
whether the Postal Service did
everything they could to protect
the employees," he said.
He said the union did not get a
heads-up about the two breach-
es from the Postal Service offi-
cials even though they happened
weeks ago.
However, the agency did noti-
fy congressional staffers about
the hacking in classified brief-
ings on October 22 and Novem-
ber 7, said Rep. Elijah Cummings
of Maryland, senior Democrat
on the House Oversight and
Government Reform Commit-
tee.
"The increased frequency and
sophistication of cyber-attacks
upon both public and private

entities highlights the need for
greater collaboration to improve
data security," Cummings wrote
Monday ina letter to Postmaster
General Patrick Donahoe.
In a statement, Donahoe
depicted cyber-attacks as "an
unfortunate fact of life these
days" for every organization
connected to the Internet. "The
United States Postal Service is
no different."
"Fortunately, we have seen no
evidence of malicious use of the
compromised data, and we are
taking steps to help our employ-
ees protect against any potential
misuse of their data," the post-
master general said.
The issue is sure to come up
at a previously scheduled Postal
Service public meeting on Fri-
day morning at agency head-
quarters here.
FBI spokesman Joshua Camp-
bell confirmed his agency is
leading a multi-agency inves-
tigation of the hacking but
declined to discuss details.
"Impacted individuals should
take steps to monitor and safe-
guard their personally identifi-
able information and report any
suspected instances of identity
theft to the FBI's Internet Crime
Complaint Center at www.ic3.
gov," he said.
The Postal Service said dis-
closing the breach when it first
occurred could have jeopar-
dized the agency's efforts to fix
the problem.

Policy would. ban
charging content
providers different
rates for service
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pres-
ident Barack Obama on Mon-
day embraced a radical change
in how the government treats
Internet service, coming down
on the side of consumer activ-
ists who fear slower download
speeds and higher costs but
angering Republicans and the
nation's cable giants who say
the plan would kill jobs.
Obama called on the Federal
Communications Commission
to more heavily regulate Inter-
net providers and treat broad-
band much as it would any
other public utility. He said the
FCC should explicitly prohibit
Internet providers like Verizon
and AT&T from charging data
hogs like Netflix extra to move
their content more quickly.
The announcement sent cable
stocks tumbling.
The FCC, an independent
regulatory body led by political
appointees, is nearing a deci-
sion on whether broadband
providers should be allowed to
cut deals with the content pro-
viders but is stumbling over the
legal complexities.
"We are stunned the presi-
dent would abandon the long-
standing, bipartisan policy of
lightly regulating the Inter-
net and calling for extreme"
regulation, said Michael Pow-
ell, president and CEO of the
National Cable and Telecom-
munications Association, the
primary lobbying arm of the
cable industry, which supplies
much of the nation's Internet
access.
This "tectonic shift in
national policy, should it be
adopted, would create devas-
tating results," added Powell,
who chaired the FCC during
the Bush administration until
2005.
Consumer groups and con-
tent providers hailed Obama's
move, with Netflix posting to
its Facebook page that "con-
sumers should pick winners
and losers on the Internet, not
broadband gatekeepers."
"Net neutrality" is the idea
that Internet service provid-
ers shouldn't block, slow or

manipulate data haying across
its networks. As long as content
isn't against the law, such as
child pornography or pirated
music, a file or video posted on
one site will load generally at
the same speed as a similarly
sized file or video on another
site.
In 2010, the FCC embraced
the concept in a rule. But last
January, a federal appeals
court struck down the regula-
tion because the court said the
FCC didn't technically have the
legal authority to tell broad-
band providers how to manage
their networks.
The uncertainty has prompt-
ed the public to file some 3.7
million comments with the
FCC - more than double the
number filed after Janet Jack-
son's infamous wardrobe mal-
function at the 2004 Super
Bowl.
On Monday, Obama waded
into the fray and gave a major
boost to Internet activists by
saying the FCC should explicit-
ly ban any "paid prioritization"
on the Internet. Obama also
suggested that the FCC reclas-
sify consumer broadband as a
public utility under the 1934

Communications Act so there's
no legal ambiguity. That would
mean the Internet would be
regulated more heavily in the
way phone service is.
"It is common sense that the
same philosophy should guide
any service that is based on the
transmission of information -
whether a phone call, or a pack-
et of data," Obama said.
This approach is exactly
what industry lobbyists have
spent months fighting against.
While Internet providers say
they support the concept of an
open Internet, they want flex-
ibility to think up new ways to
package and sell Internet ser-
vices. And, given the billions
of dollars spent to improve net-
work infrastructure, some offi-
cials say it's only fair to make
data hogs like Netflix bear
some of the costs of handling
heavy traffic.
AT&T on Monday threatened
legal action if the FCC adopted
Obama's plan, while Comcast
Corp. said reclassifying broad-
band regulation would be "a
radical reversal that would
harm investment and innova-
tion, as today's immediate stock
market reaction demonstrates."

find a just and peaceful resolution to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if we
cannot speak openly about it in Jew-
ish institutions? It is in Hillel - "The
Center For Jewish Life" - where
it makes the most sense for these
conversations to happen amongst
Jews. The shirking of Jewish institu-
tions from hard conversations only
entrenches the occupation. Passive
support for the status quo enables the
violation of Palestinians' human and
civil rights to continue and worsen.
And so, today we declare a cam-
paign for an Open Hillel. We are not
alone. Open Hillel is a nationwide stu-
dent-led movement to change Hillel's
policies to better reflect the Jewish
community's values of pluralism and
inclusivity.Themovementseeksto end
the "Standards of Partnership" which
arbitrarily draw red lines around stu-
dents whose political beliefs about the
occupation are unsavory to Hillel's
donor base.
Across the country, Jewish stu-
dents are saying "no more" and "not

in myname"to occupation inthe West
Bank and to the massacres in Gaza.
These growing numbers of students
should not be ostracized from the
community, but valued as Jews who
are inspired by our history of fighting
for justice. We demand that we be able
to speak openly without fear or vilifi-
cation. Open Hillels are being declared
on campuses across the country and
the University can be at the vanguard.
To the Hillel staff that say this
challenges them, we ask you to sit
with that discomfort. The discom-
fort of diaspora Jews should not
trump Palestinian human rights.
Vigorousdebate and discussion isthe
driving force of Judaism's holy texts
for a reason. Open conversation is
the basis of democracy, any healthy
community and a more just world. A
commitment to tolerance of various
political identities should be a prin-
ciple of our community. The one per-
cent of wealthy donors should not be
allowed to stifle the urgent conver-
sations that the 99 percent of young

Jews need to have.
Even without Hillel's support, the
Palestinian Solidarity Shabbat will
go on.It'sthis Friday, Nov. 14 at7 p.m.
in East Quad's Benzinger Library
(Room 1423). We welcome anyone
who wants to join in this informal
setting, where no views will be cen-
sored, restricted or stigmatized.
Come share in a meal with Jews and
people of all faiths who are against
the occupation and are inspired by
Jewish tradition to fight together for
equality and human rights. As we
light Shabbat candles together we
will kindle our ancestors' tradition of
radicalism and justice. In the words
of Hillel the Sage for whom the Hil-
lel Houses are named: "If I am not
for myself, who is for me? And if I am
only for myself, whatam I? And if not
now, when?"

To teach or not to teach

:E

Ioverheard a conversation on the bus the
other day that didn't sit well with me. A
guy was talking to his friend about his
exam score - a 30 percent.
He told the kid that he
didn't know one thing that
was going on in his class
and spent most of his time
making intelligent guesses
on test material that should
have been checking his
retained knowledge and
skills he learned throughout DEVIN
the semester. The guy was EGGERT
thankful he got a 30 percent
though. In the world of edu-
cation, a 30 percent translates into a B.
Now, people have their own opinions on
curved exams. However, as a senior, I've taken a
diverse set of classes at the University. SoI think
that my observations of some of the teaching
methods here have bearing. I am a double
major in English and Biopsychology, Cognition,
and Neuroscience. I have a Certificate in
Entrepreneurship. I am also a student note-
taker for Students with Disabilities. I have been
assigned to classes varying from computer
science to music theory to calculus. Each
class and subject has its own thinking skills
associated with it. But overall they share some
common themes, styles and flaws.
When I stepped into my first class at the
University of Michigan (Chemistry 130), I was
extremely grateful. I came from a small town
where I had neighbors who used cardboard to
separate their walls. I did my homework by a
space heater with my sisters. I had never heard
of ACT prep. And thank God I was an obedient
student who listened to my teachers. Otherwise
I would have completely screwed myself and
not taken the ACT seriously - like half of my
friends back home. I was lucky. Hardworking,
sure. But lucky.
Unfortunately, the barrier of getting into the
University of Michigan was not the tallest in
terms of my education. Day one, thy chemistry,
professor told us that about 30 percent of our
class would drop and that we should as soon
as possible, so that way we weren't wasting our
time. Chemistry 130 is a weeder class. We've all
heard this term before. A "weeder" class refers
to an extremely challenging class put in place to
weed out the dumb students, the ones who give
up. But what exactly are these freshmen (mostly
from a lower-SES and/or underrepresented
racial/ethnic group) giving up on?
Are they giving up banging their head against
a brick wall or from climbing a set of stairs
providedby the University's education system?
The order of skills taught through each major
and class needs to be seriously reconsidered. I
shouldn't be learning how to read and write a
basic research paper in a 300-level psychology
class. That should have been extensively taught
in a lower-level class - that way, we could all
understand the many readings we are handed.
I shouldn't walk away from a Stats 250 class
feeling like I got nothing out of it except feeling
like I worked hard. Each subject teaches a skillset
that the University is not capitalizing on in terms

of the job market. These skills should be made
clear at the beginning of the term. I will never be
a famous calculus genius. But, if I can take a class
in calculus and feel like I've gained analytical
skills instead of pounding my head against a wall
- then I have been taught something. That is a
more important lesson as a freshman, facing the
adversity that I did and getting the door slammed
in my face when I already felt like I didn't belong.
There is a general theme in some classes that
it is simply survival of the fittest. My question is
what are the students actually getting outof the
class - are they getting fit?
If a curve is being set by someone who gets a
100 percent on every exam, do you really think
that the professor/that class is necessary for
them to learn the material? The professor might
as well'give everyone a book and say sayonara
for the next four months and see who survives.
If that is the principle we are operating on, that
is not a $50,000 education.
There isahugebarrierthatenteringfreshmen
coming from more disadvantaged backgrounds
face. Most of their classmates have learned the
material that is being taught in 100-level classes
through high school AP courses. This increases
the speed that most weeder courses are taught
at and warps the perception of the lessons'
effectiveness. These disadvantaged freshmen
usually lack the study skills that are primed
by family influence and a well-funded school.
Generally,they are also (like I was), dealingwith
trying to keep their confidence up and paying for
their own school bill. I can't tell you the number
of hardworking students I have worked with as
an RA who are fighting a language barrier.
I don't think that it is just the professor's
responsibility to fix everything. I think our
services need to step up. The amount of time
students put into getting help for a resource or
direction to the right office is ridiculous. There
are people, like my friends and me, who are
workingtwoor more jobson campus. Efficiency
and effectiveness should always be a goal for
this community. That being said, I don't think
programs such as the Comprehensive Studies
Program - which oversees the Bridge Program
- are the solutions to this gap. I consider those
programs Band-Aids to what is really going on
here, protecting enough kids for the University
to use on advertisements. We are playing a
losing game.
Just like the diversity ofclasses and thought at
this University, people designing the classes and
educationalsystemshouldkeepinmindthatthere
are students from different backgrounds as well.
If the University of Michigan wants to advance,
we shouldn't be mindlessly disadvantaging
our lower portion of the bell curve. By setting
aside a little time for academic strategy when
the students are young, the University can help
disadvantaged freshmen and give advanced
students more learning opportunities. We need
to be preventative and proactive instead of
reactive. If the goal is to get us to the top, stairs
are more helpful than walls. Let's get a B back to
retaining 80 percent of a lesson, please.

An open letter to poorly dressed men on campus

earest Bro-thren,
It has come to my
attention that this campus

has been plagued
with an ailment.
I've stood
by watching
helplessly as
this pandemic
has spread from
the frat houses
to the freshman
dorms to the
classrooms, the
very classrooms
in which I must

HAYA
ALFHARAN

study and learn. Though I've not
been personally infected with it,
I've been afflicted by nausea at the
sight of those stricken. I've seen it,
ravage the majority of the campus's
male population and turn them
into a gruesome sight - a sight so
despicable it plagues my mind and
conversations every day.
Today, I take a stand so that we
can finally recognize this epidemic
and take action before this contagion
claims every last man on campus.
The ailment I'm addressing, of
course, is the rapid increase of
sloppiness in dress among the male
population, also known as Gross
Aesthetic Syndrome.
Now, I know what you're thinking:
"Perhaps this is a good thing. Perhaps
this is a movement toward a society
that places less value on appearance,
a society geared toward focusing on
what is within." No, gentlemen, I'm
afraid I must disagree. This epidemic
is threatening to the very fabric of
this University. Nay, this great nation.
I'm here to tell you that I see you.
In fact, everybody sees you.

It is with the utmost concern
that I write this letter. I only hope
that the issues I address will lead
to quick and effective action to
rectify this and you cleanse your
wardrobes of this affliction.
Stop dressing like every week is
finals week. It takes approximately
45 seconds to take off your pajama
pants and put on a pair of jeans. I
understand that you're probably
running on three hours of sleep,
but there are other ways to make'
that known. Wearing your pajamas
in public won't compensate for
the missed hours of sleep. This is
not a build-it-and-they-will-come
situation. Sleep doesn't work that
way. I know what you're thinking:
"But they have Michigan on them!"
No. Pajama pants are pajama pants,
regardless of how many block 'M's
are printed on them.
Fellas, size matters. Which is
to say, if you're going to go for the
business casual look, buy blazers
that actually fit you. Maybe you're
not ready for adulthood. Maybe
you're crippled by the very notion
and dread your future beyond
graduation. That's quite alright,
but dressing like you're a teenager
borrowing a blazer from your father
to look spiffy for a Model U.N.
conference should not be the look
you're going for. There's nothing
business or casual about it.
Of course, we can't forget our frat
brethren. Gentlemen, salmon is not
a flattering shade on anyone. I must
admit I don't know how a shade can
be so white and colorful at the same
time. I don't know how a color can
scream "bougie." I do not know the
ways of the salmon pants, but I'm

warning you against it. Enough with
the salmon-colored pants. Enough
with the salmon-colored shorts. This
is the official call for you to denounce
your salmon shackles. Can you paint
with all the colors of the wind? Yes,
you can. Except for salmon.
Basketball shorts with knee-
length socks. I'm just going to leave
that one there for you to reflect upon.
And yes, this letter extends to
male professors.WhileI respect your
degrees, dear sirs, I strongly urge
you to abandon the sad dad pants,
the academic sweater vest, and most
definitely the ever-troubling fedora.
It's OK to be hip. Try it. Maybe your
Rate My Professors rating will even

blowing it more
than slightly out of
proportion in the process.
Predictably, this column didn't
achieve its goal of capturing the
zeitgeist of what felt like the most
significant election in history. But I
stand by its message: young people
traditionally lack political power in
our democratic society, and the out-
comes of general elections are one
of the primary fronts of that power.
Lawmakers and elected officials
have a broad and exclusive mandate
to make decisions that affect people's
lives. More generally, the best-qual-
ified (and sometimes the least-bad)
candidate is not guaranteed to win
unless people actually turn out - no
matter what Nate Silver predicts on
FiveThirtyEight. Therefore, students
can gain considerable power through
the vote and should capitalize on
that opportunity.
This notion was as true last week
as it was two years ago. At the same
time, the final vote count doesn't
come close to telling the full story
of a democratic election. Names on
ballots end up there through a com-
bination of political party power
and institutional phenomena that
present a hefty and arguably over-
whelming counterweight to the

democratic will.
From its utility as a means for
consolidation of personal networks
into a candidate support structure,
to its status in the public arena to
its effectiveness as an infrastruc-
ture for raising disgustingly large
sums of money, the support of the
Democratic or Republican Parties
offers candidates, a nearly peerless
electoral edge. Moreover, the depth
of prior connections to these parties
itself has a massive role in determin-
ing who will benefit from the party
apparatus. The race for Michigan's
own 12th District starkly illus-
trates this fact through the absolute
steamrolling that the Democratic
candidate and representative-elect,
Debbie Dingell, inflicted upon not
just her Republican counterpart in
the general election, but her chal-
lengers in the Democratic primary.
The party's support for Dingell's
candidacy over every other Demo-
crat in the district was not inevita-
ble. However, it would be ludicrous
to suggest her longtime integra-
tion into state Democratic circles
through prior experience in elect-
ed office and personal connection
with a successful and well-reputed
House Democrat had nothing to do
with that outcome. Very few people
have partisan connections of that
quality, and this situation likely
deterred similarly well-qualified
Democrats who might have contest-
ed her nomination. These factors
added up to a formidable electoral
edge for Dingell before a single bal-
lot had been cast in her favor.
Factoring in institutional and
positional power alongside party
power, the power of the vote
shrinks even further. Besides his
partisan affiliation as a Democrat,
outgoing U.S. Senator Carl Levin

possessed the electoral advantage
of chairing the Senate Armed Ser-
vices Committee since 2007. That
position inevitably lends a mega-
phone to the one who possesses it
- and even more importantly for
Michigan voters in 2008 and 2002,
Levin was the only person who
could offer such deep influence
over this country's armed forces as
their representative. This was the
result of years of work within the
idiosyncratic structure of the Sen-
ate, honing Levin's edge as a can-
didate with effects similar to those
benefiting Dingell.
These two general phenomena
aren't insurmountable. However,
they set the groundwork for who
can run for political office in a non-
democratic fashion. They do this
to such an extent that the vote this
year felt like merely a mechanism
for expressing general preference,
devoid of the personal and symbol-
ic importance I so proudly attrib-
uted to it two years ago. Even as the
candidates I voted for head off to
Washington, D.C. to represent me,
incumbents on the whole continue
to overwhelmingly keep their seats,
and gridlock in Congress seems
destined to graduate to a new level
of divisiveness. Topping it all off,
the Democratic nomination for
2016 has for two years looked like a
lock for Hillary Clinton - a candi-
date whose presence on the scene is
likelyto drive away the overwhelm-
ing majority of others who might
have otherwise considered seeking
that nomination.
This is, apparently, what Ameri-
can democracy looks like. It's no
longer an inspiring view.

Niki Sunstrum, director of social media for the University, speaks at the "Coming of Age Online" event at the
Michigan Union on Monday.

EBOLA

bian said. "We don't believe that
there's any other place where the
union and management have come
together and said that they need
to prepare to take care of poten-
tial patients with Ebola and work
together to do that. So I think in
that respect, this is very unique,
but we plan to try to negotiate this
with other institutions as well."
Aside from an assurance that
nurses will receive proper PPE
and training, the contract contains
three major provisions. The first
and second provisions state that
nurses will not lose any salary or
be forced to use their "Paid Time
Off" or "Extended Sick Leave"
provisions if they are quaran-
tined due to Ebola or if they actu-
ally contract the disease. The third
provision states that the hospital
will pay for all medical treatment
and follow-ups, including psycho-
logical testing, if a nurse contracts
Ebola.
Throughout the negotiation
process, UMHS has implemented
measures as they've been agreed
uponso asto nothinder Ebolapre-
paredness, Karebian said. He also
said the contract will remain fluid-
to allow for further improvements
if necessary.
"It's going to change as we learn
more and nurses become more
trained," he said. "We will learn
from those things and we might

have to make some adjustments.
We have a nursing taskforce for
Ebola preparedness put together
that will meet twice per week to
continue to look at what we will
need to do to change and do bet-
ter."
To prepare for the unlikely sce-
nario that Ebola arrives in Ann
Arbor, UMHS has already estab-
lished a general response plan to
address the virus.
The contract comes in the midst
of conversation about statewide
preparedness for the disease.
Though Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der has said Michigan hospitals
are prepared for Ebola, a recent
MNA poll showed that more than
80 percent of Michigan nurses
don't believe their hospital has
provided them with proper train-
ing on howto treat this virus.
"My message to the governor
and to the state is that we want
to see more consistent practices
in hospitals," Karebian said. "And
we believe that the Department of
Community Health and the gover-
nor shouldstep up andsay, 'Yes,we
need to ensure that hospitals are
prepared.' And it's not enough just
to say it; they have tobe prepared."
The MNA's complaints reflect
nationwide dissatisfaction
expressed by nurses through
National Nurses Unitedand state
nurses unions, which has orga-
nized a "Day of Action" Wednes-
day in protest of a perceived lack of
preparedness for Ebola. In Califor-
nia,18,000 nurses plan tostrike for
two days starting Tuesday.

The MNA is organizing its
own event. It is planning to send
a delegation to Snyder Wednesday
morning to ask him to meet with
the union.
"We decided that since we
couldn't get him to our building,
we would go to him,"said Ann Sin-
cox, public relations and commu-
nications liaison for the MNA. "So
we are going to meet on Wednes-
day at 11:30 in front of the Rom-
ney Building. We have quite a few
nurses coming and a mobile bill-
board and we are going to invite
him to come down and join us."
Sincox said the overall goal for
the MNA is to achieve a state stan-
dard for Ebolapreparation.
"We feel the governor needs to
work with the Michigan Depart-
ment of Community Health, and
of course we're more than happy
to join in on that, to make a state
standard so that everyone is pre-
pared adequately, regardless of
what happens," she said.
Sincox added that though nurs-
es in other states are taking more
drastic measures such as protests
and strikes, the MNA believes that
a state standard for Ebola prepara-
tion can be negotiated with state
officials.
"Some states are having pro-
tests; there are a couple of states
actually having nurses walk off,"
she said. "That's not really where
we're at on this. We think going
for the state standard makes more
sense. We think that's a more col-
laborative thing, an area we think
we can do some growth in."

cO-OPS
From Page 1
Equal Exchange, a worker coop-
erative focused on Fair Trade.
Hannah Rosenberg, a junior
at Oberlin College in Ohio living
in Harkness Co-op, sat at a Star-
bucks table in lively conversation
with two other co-opers, both of
whom she had just met.
"If we have any hope of the
cooperative movement being a
national or international thing
rather than a very localized
thing, it's important to know one
another," Rosenberg said. "And
that's chill."
In addition to presentations
by co-op members, attendees ate
meals together, watched films,
played games and taught and
attended classes - one of which
was titled "The Forgotten His-
tory of Group Equity Housing
Cooperatives."
Jim Jones, the two-time for-
mer executive director of NASCO,
former executive director of Ann
Arbor's Inter-Cooperative Coun-
cil and a 2009 Cooperative Hall
of Fame inductee, taught the
course.
Jones is a cooperative history
buff. The author of"Many Hands:
A History of the Austin Coopera-
tive Community," he is also in his
25th year of work on a book about
the history of student coopera-
tives.
Jones said the country's first
student-owned cooperatives
were opened in 1932 - one of
which was in Ann Arbor - dur-
ing the Great Depression.
Sharing housing, decisions,
food and labor was the Student
Socialist Club's way of coping
with the effects of the Great
Depression. They rented a house
and inaugurated the Michigan
Socialist House cooperative,
charging each member $2 per
week for room and board, Jones
said.
Ann Arbor's student coopera-
tive movement remained embod-
ied in the lone Michigan Socialist
House, until the Campus Cooper-
ative Council, now known as the
Inter-Cooperative Council, was
born in 1937.
By 1941, the student coop-
erative movement was expand-
ing. Eleven rented houses in
Ann Arbor housed student co-
ops, eight for men and three for
women, according to the ICC's
website.
"It wasn't until the war that
things became difficult," Jones
said.
The male population, he said,
was "devastated." Many co-ops
lost their leases and were closed
and many men coming to the Uni-
versity to train for World War II
filled the former co-op houses
instead.
Still, the ICC survived.
In 1944, the ICC purchased its
first house, A.K. Stevens House.
Before this, the ICC had only'
rented. Two years later, bol-
stered by the return of soldiers
from World War II, the co-op
movement rebounded. Three
hundred co-ops emerged on 144
student campuses, according to
the video "Working Together:
The Story of the ICC," found on
the ICC's website.

By 1967, the ICC owned 10
houses. With the war behind
them, co-ops were able to refi-
nance, repay loans and develop
equity, Jones said.
Finally, in 1968, the ICC
sponsored a conference that
formed NASCO, uniting the
cooperative movement across
the United States and Canada.
Ingrained in the coopera-
tive movement is a struggle for
social justice, a struggle made
more institutional by NASCO
and the ICC.
"The (ICC) is not inherently
political, but it does inherently
promote social justice by using
collective buying and democrat-
ic self-government to give more
equitable access to resources
within the organization," said
LSA senior John-Thomas Zaka-
la-Downs, president of ICC
co-op Black Elk.
The ICC has, however, been
political in the past.
In 1943, for example, Les-
ter House was recognized in
The Saturday Evening Post for
its success and persistence in

supporting integrated hous-
ing. Jones said co-opers once
picketed the barbershop in the
basement of the Union, which
refused to cut the hair of Black
patrons.
The front door of the Union
was another point of contention
for co-opers. Women were only
permitted to enter through back
doors.
"This was the men's Union,"
Jones said with feigned severity,
"so they (women) used to rush
the door! They used to rush past
this guy that was there. These
things go way back."
The co-ops' push toward
social justice again manifest-
ed itself in 1948 when the ICC
bought Nakamura, a house
named for Johnny Nakamura, a
Japanese-American student at
the University who fought and
died in World War II.
The name exhibited the ICC's
defense of its Japanese co-op
members during World War II,
as the U.S. government interned
almost 120,000 Japanese Amer-
icans.
"(The ICC) has been at the
forefront of a lot of important
social movements, so I'm proud
to say that co-ops have always
been on the right side of history
in that way," said ICC President
Maya Menlo, a Public Policy
senior.
Inside Nakamura's living
room laid Tyler Whittico, ICC
Board Representative for Naka-
mura and Washtenaw Commu-
nity College culinary student,
who was stretched out in a col-
orful hammock hanging just
above one of the couches.
Evan Bancroft, an Eastern
Michigan University junior, laid
in another hammock, one end
of which connected to the wall
just below the strand of lights
that spelled out "Nakamura" in
cursive.
It was 6:30 p.m. and the
cousins, along with a few other
Nakamura co-opers, were
relaxing before dinner at 7 p.m.
Jazz music came wandering
in from down the stairs in the
kitchen, where Wednesday's
cooks were preparing dinner.
The co-op has dinner togeth-
er every night from Sunday to
Thursday, and sometimes, resi-
dents play Super-Smash Bros.
after dinner.
According to Whittico, it's
hard to generalize and define a
house like theirs, a co-op with
diverse members.
They house members from all
different schools in the area, an
annual summer member in his
70s and people of many differ-
ent backgrounds.
"It's really unique," Bancroft
said. "A lot of people don't con-
sider co-ops asa housing option,
and it's a relatively cheap one
too, because you get everything
at a flat rate. We all decide what
we're going to budget our food
out to be."
According to the ICC's web-
site, every member living in an
ICC house this fall and win-
ter pays $459 in ICC charges
each month, which collectively
covers all of the ICC houses'
mortgages, taxes, maintenance,
administration, furniture, utili-

ties and internet fees.
In addition to ICC charges,
each house charges its members
a monthly amount voted on at
the beginning of each semester,
a charge that goes toward food,
cleaning supplies and laundry.
Nakamura's charge this year is
$122, making for a total charge
of $581 for monthly living and
boarding.
While it isn't quite the $2
from back in 1932, coopera-
tive living helps students save
money and makes living more
affordable.
"At the same time, you elimi-
nate that sense of privacy," Ban-
croft said. "In the co-ops you
have to build up seniority to get
your own single. It's a little bit
harder. Some people appreciate
that and some people don't. It's
just a matter of taste."
Nakamura President Alexan-
dria Carey, an LSA senior, coun-
tered by showing the other edge
of the privacy argument.
"I don't know, I think it's
awesome. Probably the best
place I've lived on campus,"
Carey said. "You get to live with

30 people who become like your
best friends."
Bancroft characterized
Nakamura as a "progressive
musician's house." Every sum-
mer it hosts Rockamura, an all-
day music festival at the house.
"We're one of the younger,
more lively houses," Carey said.
The walls just outside the
living room doors, with their
green mural of abstract faces,
echoed her sentiment.
Gregory House's walls are
much cleaner. In this sub-
stance-free co-op, white and
blue seem to be the theme.
The house was named after
Karl D. Gregory, a Gregory
House alum and professor of
economics at Oakland Univer-
sity, who donated $20,000 to
the ICC.
Gregory House also has din-
ners together, though its resi-
dents voted for six dinners per
week instead of Nakamura's
five.
"We all talk and we get into
long fights about ethics and
politics after dinner," said LSA
junior Emma Nagler. "We've
been having an ongoing debate
about whether or not people's
decisions are determined, or if
people have free will."
On the doorway to Gregory
House's living room is a check-
list, a monitor of house chores.
According to Nagler, each mem-
ber is required to do four hours
of work per week, whether it is
in the form of cleaning, cook-
ing or working as a leader in the
house.
Members of Black Elk, which
is just across the street from
Gregory House and has a large
sculpture of a hand planted in
its yard, are also required to
work four hours each week to
be a cooperative member of the
house.
Historically, Black Elk has
been characterized as a veg-
etarian co-op, according to
Zakala-Downs. Residents buy
their food from socially just
companies and sustainable
farms. They eat together four
times per week and offer a
vegan option at every meal.
"The people that have lived
there have chosen, if not to be
vegetarian as their lifestyle, to
be vegetarian as a community
for the sustainability of that,"
Zakala-Downs said.
The entire corridor of Black
Elk's entryway is plastered with
writing from past and current
members.
"At Black Elk we get a lot of
communication through writ-
ing from our past, from our
history, letters, posters from
parties, artwork, signatures
and notes painted on the walls,"
Zakala-Downs said.
According to Jones, this con-
nection to the past is part of
what makes a housing co-op
different from a normal group
of people living together.
"The co-op is institutional-
ized so that people move in and
out, and that entity of the co-op
stays there," Jones said. "Over
time, the longer that entity
lasts, the stronger it becomes.
It's almost like a mythology,
and the culture grew up around

it, and then it becomes every-
body's responsibility to make
sure it lasts for the next group."
ICC cooperative members of
the past preserved their co-ops
and present-day co-opers are
reaping the benefits, especially
in the context of today's rising
tuition costs and housing pric-
es.
"It's unmanageable for a lot
of people, even if they're using
loans or doing scholarships,"
Menlo said. "It's just very tough
for some people to go to school
and pay room and board. I think
now co-ops are serving an even
more important role than ever
before because of the financial
situations of alot of students."
The co-op movement is about
returning power to its mem-
bers as an act of social justice.
NASCO, the ICC, and each
co-op are making drastic strides
toward that end, each member
owning the co-op house they
live in, the worker co-ops they
work for or the consumer co-
ops they buy from.
"Collectively, we own every-
thing," Menlo said.

sity bus since May 2013, said she
felt very comfortable driving a bus
by the time she reached in-service
training, during which she would
operate a bus with alicensed driver
or observe strategies for driving,
such as scanning patterns and
knowingwhen to stop.
According to Bidwell, 70 per-
cent of students and temporary
hires who enter the training pro-
cess succeed. But 30 percent don't
reach proficiency, and if at any
point it becomes clear that they
aren't progressing at a satisfactory
pace, trainers then meet and dis-
cuss an improvement plan. If after
that meeting prospective drivers
still don't demonstrate sufficient
improvement, they are released.
Bidwell said PTS is always
observing its operations to identify
potential improvements. After an
accident, PTS officials review the
incident to see how it could have

"We feel that UMMA has a
really special role to play in the
education of students here at

UMMA deputy director for

tions. "By exposing them to the
art of the world that awaits them
when they graduate, they will
have a deeper understanding of

been avoided. Bidwell said PTS is
also looking at route planning and
scheduling in order to add cush-
ion routes with extra travel time.
These routes allow drivers to focus
on safety first and discourages
them from rushing to their next
stop.
Tucker said schedule and route
planning changes have helped
immensely.
"We know safety comes first
and schedule comes last," she
said. "Even if I feel that I'm fall-
ing behind I don't worry about it
because there are different ways to
catch up."
However, Tucker said she feels
that drivers have developed a bad
reputation, partly as a result of
buses not always running on time
and partly as a reaction to some of
the incidents that have occurred
over the last few years.
"Idon'tthinkpeopleunderstand
what it takes tobea bus driver and
the amount of attention it requires
and the tests we have to pass," she
said. "People just get frustrated

because we're late."
Despite these incidents, Bidwell
said students make excellent driv-
ers and PTS should continue to
employ them.
"Students at the University of
Michigan are some of the best
and brightest young people that
we have in the country," he said.
"We're a great University, and
students go on to do great things,
and I think they do great things
while they're here being students.
Included in that is driving transit
coaches. They're fully capable and
they do a great job."
Bidwell declined to comment on
the details of the two most recent
accidents, their legal repercus-
sions or the disciplinary actions
taken against the drivers involved
inthem.
"Ourthoughts and prayersreally
go out to anybody affected by this.
We're really saddened by these
events," he said. "Our thoughts and
prayers are with the families and
the people that have been affected
by these things."


allows UMMA to collaborate
with other campus organizations
to better integrate the art center
with academic projects. Throm
said current Academic Coordina-
tor David Choberka has worked
with many professors to broaden
the curricular experience for
their students.
The museum's collections
assistant and History of Art Fel-
lowship will receive $250,000
to continue their work for three
more years.
UMMA's collections assistant
works alongside the academic
coordinator to encourage stu-
dents to use the museum's col-
lections and initiate research
projects. The assistant also builds
relationships with other colleges
and academic communities.
Throm said UMMA currently
services 37 percent of Univer-
sity schools and programs and 34
percent of LSA departments.
The grant will also fund
the History of Art Curatorial

Research Fellowship, which
allows a history of art doctoral
student to work with museum
collections in his or her academic
specializations.
Throm said the fellowship
provides doctoral students with a
broader understanding of profes-
sions in the art history field.
"Wehave putthe studentexpe-
rience at the top of our strategic
planning process," she said. "We
really think about how the stu-
dent experience is impacted by
our work at the museum. While
we serve a very important role
in the community to people who
aren't students, we are affiliated
with the University of Michigan
and we have alot to contribute to
the academic mission of the Uni-
versity."
An UMMA press release said
the museum will also expand
its focus in new fields of study,
update records and increase its
number of collections access
requests.

the two groups to remember to

like to keep that going. I don't

want to think of them as sides
because they aren't opposites,
but we have a lot to learn from
each other. Pro-life and pro-
choice also have a lot to learn
from people who try to stay out
of that 'dichotomy."'

n the opening-credits
scene of 2014's most
popular blockbuster
film, "Guardians of the Gal-
axy," the lonely figure of
Peter Quill
(Chris Pratt)
is seen
traversing
a rocky,
desolate
planet. Typ-
ical-action-
movie-score ADAM
strings THEISEN
swell in the
background
as Quill arrives at some
abandoned ruins. Enter-
ing the dilapidated monu-
ment, the camera focuses on
Quill's face, but the clichdd
music dies out. Quill fills the
silence by putting on a pair
of cheap-looking headphones
and hitting play on his Walk-
man.
Suddenly, unexpectedly,
Redbone's long-forgotten
1974 hit "Come and Get Your
Love" is playing, and Quill
is dancing among the wreck-
age. Like an intergalactic
Michael Jackson, he struts
along his path, spinning
around as he sings the song's
gleeful refrain into a micro-
phone that also happens to
be a small alien life form.
While lesser movies would've
likely picked your typi-
cal heroic instrumental to
accompany Quill's trek to his
mystical orb, director James
Gunn chose an upbeat '70s
jam and created an unforget-
table gete. ;
Too often whyen I' lis-
tening to music, I'll try to
pick songs from my iPod or
Spotify favorites that per-
fectly fit my current mood.
When I'm angry, I'll listen to
Minor Threat; when I'm fun,
Motown; when I need to con-
centrate on homework,Miles
Davis.
For the most part, there's
nothing wrong with this
strategy, but sometimes it
means I'll end up in a bad
mood and won't listen to
anything but the sorrow-
ful voices of Nick Drake or
Elliott Smith. I love those
guys, but I'm not always
looking for them to prolong
my mood - instead, I want
something that'll jumpstart
me out of it.
The other day I was lis-
tening to melancholy music
while walking to a class I
was dreading on a gloomy,
overcast day. Sprinkles start
hitting my glasses and finally
I decide that I'm just done
with this crap. So, inspired
by "Guardians," I switch
off my slow, sad ballad and
turn on "Come and Get Your
Love."
It was perfect. The
methodical bounciness of
the opening bass line, joined
quickly by the guitar, was
mimicked by the bounce in
my step. I was smiling and
trying my best to keep my
body from noticeably copy-
ing Chris Pratt's moves as I

swaggered my way down the
rainy streets of Ann Arbor.
In the 40 seconds it took
to get to the "Come and get
your looooo-hove!" chorus,
my mood had completely
changed. Sometimes, I real-
ized, I don't need to be stuck
in an unpleasant mood, and
I can use music to get me out
of it.
Naturally, I've been try-
ing to find other songs that
recreate this feeling - songs
that won't necessarily cure
all of my worries, but ones
that will at least help reori-
ent my mood on gloomy days.
The first obvious choice
was Three Dog Night's "Joy
to the World." The song's lyr-
ics are easy to laugh off but
impossible to forget. Singer
Hoyt Axton screams the first
line ("Jeremiah was a bull-

frog!") with such elation and
import that he sounds like
a scientist who's discovered
the missing piece of his life's
work. The guitars sound
much like they do on "Come
and Get Your Love," and the
chorus is just as easy to sing
along to. Even if you've never
heard the song before, you'll
be bobbing your head and
mouthing "joy to the fishes
in the deep blue sea/joy to
you and me" by the two-min-
ute mark.
It's not just your dad's
classic rock hits that have
this effect, though. Kend-
rick Lamar's "i" is a recent
example of life-affirming,
impossible-to-deny music
that obliterates all sadness.
(The assist from The Isley
Brothers is certainly the key
here - hip-hop producers
can almost never go wrong
when they sample old-school
soul.) UGK and Outkast's
"Int'l Players Anthem (I
Choose You)" is another one.
Andr 3000's verse always
hits me like a dive into a pool
on a 100-degree day.
We want The
Supremes and
Prince. We want
'500 Miles.
Rock songs with an edge
can have that "it" factpar,.
too, "Sheena is a y, Rpk-
er" by The Ramones also
soundtracks the beginning of
"Rock 'n' Roll High School,"
one of my favorite opening-
credits scenes of all-time.
Riff Randell plays the song
on her school's PA and the
entire school gets up and
dances. The song's effect on
young people is only slightly
overstated in the film.
So I've been trying to fig-
ure out what the common
denominator is. What, spe-
cifically, do these songs have
that make them such great
pick-me-ups? It certainly
isn't the case that every
popular, catchy song is a
perfect antidote to the blues.
Britney Spears, for example,
is great, but she doesn't get
me moving and smiling the
way that "Shake It Off" or
MKTO's "Classic" do. There's
something too stilted about
Spears's early work, and
something too grimy about
the later work - like she's
more under the control of
her producers than the song.
"Shake It Off" and "Classic"
have ingenious melodies, but
they also sound so effort-
less, like they just came to
their creators suddenly one
moment in the studio.
While I suppose it's pos-
sible that some people hate
Taylor Swift and get out
of their chairs for Britney,
my experiences with large,
diverse group events (like
weddings or sporting events)

tells me that there's a specific
subset of fun-filled songs
that connect generations and
improve everyone's mood.
And I think it comes down
to relaxation. When we're
stressed out and need to
loosen up, or even when we're
not and just want to dance
and sing, we want songs that
reflect that. We want people
who make it look easy. We
want The Supremes and
Prince. We want "500 Miles"
and "Sweet Caroline." If
we're going to shed our wor-
ries and boogie like we're on
an abandoned planet, we need
artists who are trying to do
the same.

'MasterChef Junior'
is reality TV's best

Cohesive 'Broke With
Expensive Taste'
impresses
By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
DailyArts Writer
Broke With Expensive Taste is
an album that begs to be listened
to in its entirety, even with its
unusual length
- 16 songs A
measuring in
at 60 minutes Broke
and 19 seconds. With
Most of the
songs sound Expensive
quite similar, Taste
but not in a .a
trite, boring Azeala
way; each track Banks
transitions Prospect Park
smoothly into
the next, giving the illusion that
the album might just be one
incredibly long and satisfying
harmony.
The album opens with "'Idle
Delilah,' a haunting track whose
main riff pops up again in later
songs, such as "Soda" and "Miss
Amor," continuing the illusion of
a single, hour-long composition.
"Idle Delilah" itself begins with a
beat from a drum and synthesizer,
slowly building to adding in a
kick drum. While the rhythm is
pretty steady and simple, it has
an anticipatory feel to it. When
Banks's voice comes in a couple
beats later, with its airy timbre,
it's as if the top has been taken off
of the boiling pot of water.
Banks's debut showcases her
knack for innovation, and in this
way, "Idle Delilah" sets the tone
for the rest of the album. The
song has no clear structure, and in
what could possibly be considered

the bridge, the mating calls of a
primate are dubbed over the new,
bell-like beat. And, somehow, it
works.
The second track, "Gimme A
Chance," switches into Spanish
in the second half of the song;
"Desperado" features a radio DJ
introducing the tune in a meta
sort of way; "Heavy Metal and
Reflective" opens with a sound
that could either be construed
as sweeping or the bustle of a
FedEx mailroom; "Ice Princess"
fittingly showcases the sound of a
(presumably) cold wind blowing;
and multiple tracks contain
trumpets blasting. She creates
music outofeverydaylife.
Banks pushes the boundaries
of traditional music conventions,
and, for the most part, she
succeeds, creating such
wonderful beats and melodies
that the unconventional aspects
of the songs work in their favor.
She pairs synthesized beats
with drums, with xylophones,
with trumpets, with the sultry
timbre of her voice in expertly
mastered paradox.
Where she fallsflat isontrack
14, "Nude Beach A Go-Go."
While the song fits with the
rest of the album by continuing
some overtly sexual themes, the
music, melody and lyrics about
drinking Coca-Cola cause it to
feel more like a country song
than the electro-hip-hop of the
rest of the album. It's unclear
whether this song was meant to
be even more innovative than
the rest of the album and just
fell horribly flat, or whether it's
meant as a joke or even a slight
at the rest of the music industry.
Whatever Banks intended,
the song interrupts the flow of
an otherwise seamless track
order. (I actually mistook it
for a corny jingle on a Spotify

commercial when it came on.)
Insome ways, it's also one of the
most traditional songs on the
album, sporting a traditional
verse-chorus form and only
clocking in at 2 minutes and
20 seconds, whereas most
other tracks are 4-5 minutes.
It doesn't fit, and, frankly, it's
obnoxious to listen to, while the
rest of the tunes are so soothing
that they almost put the listener
in a trance.
What should be juxtaposed
with this trance-like state
of listening are the lyrics to
"212," in which Banks intones,
"she wanna lick my plum in
the evening," followed by,
"and fit that tongue deep in. I
guess that cunt getting eaten."
Yet, there is something in
the way Banks performs, an
assuredness, that makes what
is probably considered one of
the worst words in the English
language perfectly normal
to utter. Considering a good
portion of the lyrics in the other
tracks on the album isn't easy
to comprehend (a quality that,
normally frowned upon, adds
to the trance-like quality of her
songs), it seems Banks is once
again pushing the boundaries
here, making a statement. And,
once again, she succeeds.
On Broke With Expensive
Taste, Banks creates such an
environment that the album
could be listened to as a lullaby-
or bumped at a club. She
soothes, but she provokes. She
follows tradition, but she toes
the line. She goes hard on tracks
like "Yung , Rapunxel," but
she lightens up on tracks like
"Wallace." She almost creates
a new genre: not quite hip-
hop, not quite dance, not quite
electronic, not quite rap, but
completely Azealia Banks.

FOX show's second
season is Gordon
Ramsay's finest
By ALEX INTNER
Daily Arts Writer
Gordon Ramsay is known for
being loud with his celebrity
character based on his brash
personality
and angry A~
interactions.
But, this MasterChef
hard image Junior
has changed
slightly with Season Two
the premiere Premiere
of a spinoff Tuesdays at 8 p.m.
of one of FOX
his hits,
"MasterChef Junior." By
surrounding Ramsay with a
group of incredibly talented
child cooks, he was able to
show a side of himself that
doesn't usually appear in his
other programs. In the process,
he made this new series much
better than his others. With a
strong second season return,
"MasterChef Junior" can
proudly claim its place as not
only the crown jewel of the
Gordon Ramsay reality empire
but also the best reality show
on network television.
In "MasterChef Junior,"
children from ages eight to 13
compete with one another in
a cooking competition. The

contestants are tiny; some
are even too small to lift the
equipment. Despite that,they're
preparing pork tenderloin
and an assortment of chicken
dishes that look like they
could be served in a high-class
restaurant. At this point, it's a
little too early in the season for
any of the participants to really
pop the way that Sarah and
eventual winner Alexander did
last year because there are just
too many. This is a problem that
every iteration of "MasterChef"
has, but one that resolves itself
as the season moves along.
What really separates
"MasterChef Junior" from the
other shows in the Ramsay
network is that it's built from a
genuinely sweet place. There's
none of the vindictiveness
and backstabbing that make
competitions like "Hell's
Kitchen" difficult to watch.
When someone doesn't do
well, the contenders express
support instead of just giving
the camera coy smiles.
The best moment in the
episode came when the other
competitors comforted one
player who broke down after
presenting the judges a dish
with raw chicken. It's rare that
something with that amount
of authentic kindness actually
makes it to the final cut, and
it's something that should be
savored.
From a judging perspective,
Ramsay and professional chefs

and restaurateurs, Graham
Elliot and Joe Bastianich, are
never overly harsh. Because
they're assessing kids, they
find a way to give pointed
criticism without coming
across like they're attacking
the children themselves, as
they often do on "MasterChef"
senior. Bastianich especially
tones down his abrasiveness
from what he brings to the
adult version, to the point
where he's a better judge for it.
The show also has slick
editing. It doesn't have the
same drawn-out nature of
"MasterChef," and it allows
the episode to feel freer. In
addition, they incorporate
some fantastic reaction shots
and testimonials from the
children. A big part of watching
the program is those clips;
some of the kids' comments
make for great television.
"MasterChef Junior"
has elements of what every
competition series should
have - great editing, skilled
contestants and intelligent, but
not overly cruel, judging. What
sets it above the others is a
lack of theatric maliciousness,
which keeps the focus where
it should be - on the talented
kid chefs - rather than on the
sabotage or hatred. Even with a
busy schedule, the show is well
worth the time. It's easy on
the brain and, because of that,
it's one of the most enjoyable
hours on network television.

'Gone Girl' suffers fromh

SWaiting for the next
musical bomb to drop

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY
DailyArts Writer
What keeps me on my toes?
Well, a pop quiz in Earth 103, my
girlfriend and as of late, the music
industry.
Gone are the days of waking
up and checking my e-mails and
texts. Now, iTunes, Soundcloud
and musicians' Facebook pages
are the first thing on my mind.
Is someone going to drop a sin-
gle? Is someone going to drop a
video? Is someone going to drop
an album?
The trend's best example is the
musical bomb that dropped Dec.
13, 2013 in the wee hours of the
morning: Beyoncd's self-titled
masterpiece. And as much of a
blessing that album was, it has
forever changed the game and
raised my blood pressure.
Listeners no longer have full
musical knowledge by waiting
until 12 a.m. Tuesdays. Or even
12 a.m. any day of the week.
What if an artist decides 3 a.m. is
a good time? Or maybe 2 p.m.? IT
DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS IN
ANARCHY. Listeners have no
clue when the next bomb is com-
ing or who is going to drop it.

I saw "Gone Girl" with my
girlfriend and a colleague from
The Michigan Daily, both big
fans of the book. Post-showing,
the two of them agreed that it
was incredibly absorbing and
engaging, which I enthusias-
tically echoed. To me, "Gone
Girl" was remarkably well-
crafted ... with the exception of
one scene.
There is one terrible, awful,
scene-ruining, tension-break-
ing, cringe-inducing moment
in "Gone Girl," one that (quite
understandably, mind you) nei-
ther of my Rave theater com-
rades noticed.

scene.
In one scene, Ben Affleck's
character is shown playing a
PlayStation 3 when his wife
(Rosamund Pike) walks in
the room to speak to him. The
camera at one point swings to
show the television screen, on
which footage of what appears
to be Battlefield 3's (2010)
single-player campaign mode
is shown. At this point, every
hardcore gamer in the audience
likely rolled their eyes.
What was the problem? To
put it simply, it's too obvious
Affleck's character is not actu-

With two weeks to reflect on
a dismal seven-game stretch,
a passage Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson called one
of the worst he
can remember NOTEBOOK
in his 30
years, the Wolverines (2-5) sat
down individually with their
coaching staff.
In each meeting, the point
was to discuss two things:
personal performance and
individual development.
"We kind of divided the
first half of the year up into
segments - this is a seven-
game segment and the next
segment will be eight games,"
Berenson said. "So where we
are as individuals, how we
performed and the things we
have to do better."
Each sit-down was filled
with personalized, "honest
feedback" based solely on
games played. Even if for some,
such as freshmen Alex Talcott
and Cutler Martin, that sample
size includes just two starts.
Experienced players like
sophomore forward JT

MOURNING A
MICHIGAN LEGEND:
Wally Grant, a three-time
All-American who tallied
146 points in four years at
Michigan, passed away last
Wednesday at the age of 86.
A native of Eveleth,
Minnesota, Grant came to
Ann Arbor in 1945 without a
scholarship in hopes of earning
a spot on the Michigan hockey
team. His game-winning goal
against Dartmouth in 1948
earned the Wolverines their
first national championship.
Grant is credited with
starting the "Eveleth Express,"
a pipeline of skaters from
the small town who helped
Michigan win six NCAA titles
in 10 years under coach Vic
Heyliger.
In 1994, Grant was inducted
into the U.S. Hockey Hall of
Fame. He was a Legend of
Michigan Hockey, a member
of the University of Michigan
Hall of Honor and the Dekers
Club Hall of Fame.
"Although his career was
outstanding, his relationship
with the program was even
more outstanding," Berenson
said ina statement. "He and his
wife Mickey have been solid
supporters in every regard.
They've done whatever it takes
to support this hockey team
and all of the players and the
program in general."

The shooting wasn't quite
there early in the Michigan
men's basketball team's
exhibition against Wayne State,
and neither was the smooth
offense the Wolverines used to
win the Big Ten last season.
And those issues reached
a climax with 14:31 left in the
game, when junior point guard
Derrick Walton Jr. went down
holding his left leg. Even junior
guard Caris LeVert said he was
nervous to see the Wolverines'
starting floor general wincing.
Freshman forward Kam
Chatman fed Walton off a
rebound, and Walton started the
fast break before finishing with
a layup at the other end. That
built Michigan's lead to 26, and a
crowd of 10,510 erupted - until
it noticed Walton grimacing on
the baseline under the basket.
But things actually went up
from there.
Walton hobbled off and then
went to the locker room, only
to return to the court three
minutes later and went back
in the game shortly thereafter.
By that time, the lead was a
comfortable 28, and all was
well again. The Wolverines
wouldn't need Walton much
after his return, extending their
lead to more
than 40 before
the buzzer "At the
sounded, the
final score the
reading 86-43. day
As the clock of have
wound down,
the score situa
seemed trivial
but the moment
of the night
came in the
final minute. With the game long
since decided, Michigan coach
John Beilein inserted freshman
guard Austin Hatch and told the
team to get him the ball.
They did so a couple times,
and the bench implored him to
shoot. In the final seconds, his
patience was rewarded as he
went to the line and scored his
first career point.
"I wouldn't say a sense of
relief," Hatch said. "But it was
cool, though. I'm not goingto lie.
I'm not going to say, 'No big deal.
It was just a free throw.' At the
end of the day, after all of which
has happened, I kind of have a
unique situation."
Hatch, who drew a standing
ovation with both his entrance
and his free throw, was the
highlight of a night in which
Michigan struggled to pull away
until the second half, finishing
just 7-for-22 from 3-point range.

"We didn't shoot the ball well
from three, so there's always
room for improvement there,"
LeVert said. "I'm not sure what
we shot, but it wasn't one of
our better nights. To see us still
score over 80 was encouraging
for us."
In a clear mismatch, though,
Michigan was never threatened.
Momentum swings, like
sophomore guard Zak Irvin's
fast-break dunk 2:03 into the
game and junior guard Spike
Albrecht's steal and layup,
dispelled any concern. But in an
exhibition, Beilein found plenty
of errors to clean up.
After just 89 seconds, he took
out Walton after he committed
an early foul for Albrecht. And
Albrecht promptly grabbed a
rebound and went coast-to-coast
for a finger roll. Walton later
came in and finished the first
half with eight points on five-
for-five free-throw shooting.
After just 2:44, Beilein took
out Irvin, who turned the ball
over and fouled the shooter at
the other end. He replaced him
with freshman guard Aubrey
Dawkins, and Irvin later came
back in and slammed home an
alley-oop from LeVert.
While Michigan's offense
didn't get going until the second
half, its defense kept Wayne

game. The

forced six
turnovers in the first seven
minutes of the second half,
including one that culminated
with Albrecht's behind-the-
back pass to LeVert for a dunk.
"I really wouldn't know what
moment to point out, but I know
Coach has just been harping
on our defense," Irvin said.
"Our defense can turn into our
offense, because we're pretty
good in transition, so that's just
something we've been working
on."
That would be just about the
end of the drama, especially
when Walton returned a few
moments later. It hadn't been a
perfect night, but the damage
was minimal.
"It's hard to believe we went
to Europe and we're not further
along, but I'm not moving as
quickly as maybe I would have
in past years," Beilein said. "I
just don't think we're there yet."

What we learned: Northwestern

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
Thankfully, we're not being
tested on what we learned from
the Michigan football team's
10-9 victory over Northwestern.
If we were, we probably wouldn't
do so well.
That's because if this
weekend proved anything, the
Wolverines are a difficult team
to understand. And even when
we ask for answers, we'd only
hear about how players failed to
execute.
But we managed to find a few
takeaways from this weekend,
so here are the five things we
learned.
1. There's a reason the
running back spot is open for
competition
Following redshirt sophomore
Drake Johnson's performance
against Indiana last week, in
whichhe rushed for122yards and
two touchdowns, the backfield
was poised for a new leader.
But after sophomore De'Veon
Smith's 121-yard-performance
with a touchdown on Saturday,
the conversation continues.
Smith, who was fed the ball
as the game wound down,
saw 18 carries to Johnson's 10.
Johnson didn'thelp hiscase after
fumbling the ball, despite having
it recovered by redshirt junior
Joe Kerridge.
Both bring something
different to the running game
- Smith, a bigger bruising back
and Johnson, a quicker, slashing
runner - but one hasn't stood out
more than the other. With two
games remaining, expect to see
the duo splitting carries as the
offense looks to find its rhythm.
2. The offensive line is
playing some of its best
football
This is new to us too, but the
offensive line, the same one that.
has struggled to open holes up
for running backs, wasn't a a
negative on Saturday.
That's not to say it's playing
spectacular, but it's not playing
poorly enough to be noticeable.
The offensive line had only one
false start penalty, it gave fifth-

year senior quarterback Devin
Gardner time to throw and
opened holes for running backs
to run through. Gardner wasn't
sacked even once and Michigan's
147 yards are one of its highest
marks on the season.
There are still issues to be
worked out, but if there were
ever a time when it needed to
play its best, this would be it.
3. The Wolverines have a
new go-to target, and it isn't
DevinFunchess
The Michigan receiving corps
is a one-man show right now,
but it's not who you have come
to expect. Redshirt sophomore
Amara Darboh has become
Gardner's best option.
After dropped two balls
against the Wildcats, junior wide
receiver Devin Funchess has
now gone three straight games
with multiple drops. Since he
got three touchdowns against
Appalachian State in the first half
on Aug. 30, Funchess has caught
only one other touchdown pass.
Darboh, meanwhile, has
been Michigan's most reliable
presence of late, catching four
passes for 41 yards in Evanston
and nine passes for 107 yards
l

against Indiana.
But Darboh can't do it all on
his own. For the Wolverines to
help Gardner, someone will have
to step up in the next two games.
Otherwiseoffensive coordinator
Doug Nussmeier's scheme is easy
to defend.
4. The secondary can make
or break how well Michigan's
defense performs
Michigan's front seven have
been the backbone to its defense
all seasonbuttheycanonly doso
much.
Despite limiting Northwestern
to minus-nine rushing yards and
six sacks, the front seven couldn't
slow down quarterback Trevor
Siemian on the final drive, as he
picked apart the Wolverines' sec-
ondary to reach the end zone.
Defensive backs senior
Raymon Taylor and redshirt
junior Blake Countess played too
far off receivers, giving room for
passes to develop and relying on
the front seven to create pressure
quickly.
Last weekend Michigan's two
interceptions came from the
front seven, not the secondary.
Sophomore cornerback Jourdan
Lewis is the only member of the

secondary to have recorded an
interception with two of the five.
Only against Indiana has
Michigan been able to slow
any passing attack - but that
game appears to be both more
of an anomaly and a reflection
on the Hoosiers' offense. And
if Michigan hopes to make a
bowl game, it's going to need
help at the back of the defense
to provide relief.
BOLD PREDICTION:
Michigan will not draw
more than 100,000 fans
against Maryland
Saturday's win was ugly,
confusing and confusingly
ugly. It was comical, but not
entertaining.
And it's why fans will struggle
to show up in two weeks when
Maryland comes to town. It's
likelythe reason the large alumni
base in Chicago failed to turn up
in Evanston.
Maryland is 6-3 overall, but
it hasn't played exciting football
by any means. With cold weather
expected combined with a
Michigan team that needed
three quarters to score, Saturday
is shaping up to make the wrong
kind of history.
