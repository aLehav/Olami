Severalmembers of the Uni-
versity community participated
in the White House's College
Opportunity Day of Action in
Washington D.C. Thursday,
a national event focusing on
increasing the number of stu-
dents able to attend college.
President Barack Obama,
First Lady Michelle Obama and
Vice President Joe Biden were
keynote speakers at the event.
More than 140 top college execu-
tives attended, including Daniel
Little, chancellor of University
of Michigan-Dearborn. Several
other higher education officials
and researchers, including Public
Policy Prof. Susan Dynarski, also

attended the event.
"(The speakers) focused on the
social justice importance and the
economic importance of extend-
ing access to disadvantaged peo-
ple in our country and being able
to help a segment of our popula-
tion that is historically very dis-
advantaged," Little said. "They
expressed values I think all of us
buy into."
In a conference call Wednes-
day, Josh Earnes, White House
Press Secretary; James Kvaal,
a deputy director of the White
House Domestic Policy Council;
Celia Munoz, deputy director of
the White House Domestic Policy
Council and Secretary of Educa-
tion Arne Duncan said the Col-
lege Opportunity Dayof Action is
a continuation of a similar event
that occurred in January of this
year, which included more than
100 leaders from different higher
education institutions around
the country. They added that
they hoped to outline progress
made since the first summit and
brainstorm ways to improve.

Steven Salaita
highlights
importance of
academic freedom
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Indigenous studies scholar
Steven Salaita, who was de-
hired from the University ofIlli-
nois amidst controversy earlier

thisyear, spoke at the University
Thursday evening in an event
hosted by Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality.
Salaita, who was set to begin
a tenured position at Illinois this
fall, had his job offer retracted
after a number of donors, stu-
dents and faculty at the school
contended that he was anti-
Semitic.
The charge stemmed from
comments Salaita had tweet-
ed from his personal Twitter
account during the summer

amidst escalating tensions
between Gaza and Israel, in
which he condemned Israel's
July bombing of Gaza. The
bombing resulted in an estimat-
ed 2,000 deaths in the area.
Speakingto a receptive crowd
of nearly 100 professors and stu-
dents in Hutchins Hall, who
gave him a standing ovation
before he began speaking, Salai-
ta discussed the circumstances
surrounding his exit from Illi-
nois, along with broader themes
of academic freedom.

He said reactions to his fir-
ing have run the gamut of poli-
tics and opinions, but what
disappointed him most is what
he characterized as a lack of
honesty.
"If you want to support what
the (University of Illinois) did,
I don't begrudge you," he said.
"What I ask of you though, is
honesty. I don't want you to say
that Salaita wasn't actually hired
yet; anybody who has spent any
time in academe knows full well

Startup High School

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Two years ago, members of
MPowered - one of the Univer-
sity's main entrepreneurship-
focused student organizations
- went into classrooms at Ann
Arbor's Pioneer High School to
pilot a program of small entrepre-
neurship workshops for students.
After receiving positive feed-
back,, MPowered established the
initiative as a permanent program
called Startup High School, and
expanded to cater to schools in
Metro Detroit for the 2013-2014
academic year, offering workshops
only to students who are selected
through an application process
that involves pitching startup
ideas.
This year, Startup High School
will enter its third cycle, seeking
innovative high school students
not only from Detroit and its sur-
rounding suburbs, but also from
Grand Rapids. The group's online
application closes Dec. 31.
Engineering junior Eric Yu, co-
director of Startup High School,
said in the program's first official
year, the organization received
more than 350 pitches from high
school students in Detroit. This
time, it's aiming to garner more
than 1000.

Calif. homeless camp

I&

Police and social-
service workers
disperse people
sleeping outside
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - About
50 muddy souls dragged their
meager belongings out of a trash-
strewn California creek bed
Thursday as police and social-
service workers began clearing
away one of the nation's largest
homeless encampments, a collec-
tion of flimsy tents and plywood
shelters in the heart of Silicon
Valley.
The people forced out of the
camp known as the Jungle ended
up alongside a busy San Jose
road, startling passers-by who
slowed down to watch.
"People drive by and look at us
like we're circus animals," said a
sobbingNancy Ortega.
H-M

More than 30 police officers
and dozens of construction work-
ers in white hazmat suits joined
about 15 social-service workers in
the effort to take apart the treach-
erous community that at its peak
housed as many as 350 people liv-
ing in squalor just a short drive
from tech giants Google, Apple,
Yahoo and eBay.
Ortega shuddered and
clutched her fleece blanket while
watching tractors cram couches,
tents, blankets, rotten food and
pails of excrement into roaring
garbage trucks.
"It's just junk to everyone else
but to us, that's home. That's our
stuff," she said.
On a nearby sidewalk, Al Pal-
aces, a former truck driver who
settled into the encampment
about eight months ago, said he
was trying to think of a plan.
"I just grabbed whatever I
could because I don't want to go
to jail," he said, standing next
-UU

to an overloaded shopping cart
stuffed with dirty plastic bags.
For months, social workers
have been trying to house camp
residents. And four days ear-
lier, they were warned they had
until dawn Thursday to leave or
face arrest for trespassing. Still,
city officials estimated about 60
people remained at the filthy site
when cleanout day came.
After a rainy night, skies
cleared Thursday, and one per-
son after another in varying
states of mental clarity and sobri-
ety dragged their belongings in
suitcases, shopping carts and on
bicycles out of the camp through
ankle-deep sludge. By midmorn-
ing, dozens had reached the side-
walk, abandoning most of their
possessions.
But some remained in the
slum.
Valentine Cortes, who said he
was a journeyman construction
worker, said he had no plans to
leave his makeshift shelter built
into a steep, muddy slope.
"I don't know why people got
all chaotic today," he said. "We
don't have to go."
Asked about the warning
that he could be jailed, Cortes
shrugged, pet a 6-week old puppy
in his palm and said, "Then I
guess I'll be arrested."
Dogs and cats still roamed the
square-mile camp, some of them
pets, others wild. Rats hopped
through the muck.
A few dozen protesters gath-
ered at the site holding signs
reading "Homeless people mat-
ter" and "Stand with The Jungle."
The encampment stands in
stark contrast to the surround-
ing valley, a region that leads the
country in job growth, income
and venture capital.
Palaces said he liked the
Jungle better than the streets
because people would bring
food and police didn't bother
the residents.
"Even a job wouldn't give me
a house" because housing prices
are so high, he said.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani speaks to delegates and ministers during the London Conference on Afghanistan on
Thursday in London, England.
U. S. -pledges support
to Afghan govern-ment

Britain, allies
agree to back newly
installed president
LONDON (AP) - The Unit-
ed States, Britain and other
allies promised Thursday not
to abandon Afghanistan's new
government, and the country's
president said "peace is a top
priority" as international secu-
rity missions end and Taliban
attacks surge.
At a one-day meeting of
envoys from more than 60 coun-
tries, Afghan President Ashraf
Ghani said observers who had
predicted doom for Afghanistan
as the international military
presence wound down were
wrong.
"History will not be repeat-
ed. We have overcome the past,"
Ghani told diplomats at the end
of the conference.
Ghani was elected in Septem-
ber in Afghanistan's first peace-
ful transition of power, though
he has yet to form a stable Cabi-
net.
He said he was confident
Afghanistan would overcome
its challenges.
"We hope that we will never

need direct combat support
(again), because the last thing
we want is more blood," he said.
"Peace is a top priority for us."
British Prime Minister David
Cameron assured Afghans that
"we are with you every step of
the way."
The 13-year international
combat mission in Afghanistan
ends Dec. 31, although Ghani
has signed security agreements
with Washington and NATO
permitting a continued interna-
tional military presence. Some
10,000 American troops will
remain by the end of the year.
Insurgents have sought to
destabilize Ghani's govern-
ment and unnerve international
agencies with several high-pro-
file attacks in Kabul.
Afghanistan came to the con-
ference seeking reassurance it
won't be forgotten after most
international troops leave. The
West, in turn, wants to see a
stable government and action
to curb the corruption that has
long plagued Afghanistan.
Ghani pledged to deliver
fundamental reform, say-
ing Afghans strongly backed
the unity government he has
formed with his former political
rival Abdullah Abdullah.

Economically, he conceded,
"we have not done well. But that
is the challenge we have inher-
ited.
He signaled that he would
fight corruption, telling inter-
national firms and donors "we
are determined to do business
differently."
Thursday's conference
served as a follow-up to a 2012
meeting in Tokyo, where allies
pledged $16 billion to help
rebuild and stabilize Afghani-
stan's government. But officials
in London would not discuss
how much of that money Kabul
so far has received, even as they
acknowledged that, in the short
term at least, Afghanistan can-
not survive on its domestic rev-
enues alone.
Since 2012, the United States
has sent Afghanistan's govern-
ment $8 billion in assistance,
and Kerry promised Thurs-
day to ask the U.S. Congress
to approve "extraordinary"
but unspecified levels of new
aid through 2017. He also said
Washington and Kabul are try-
ing to open investment oppor-
tunities for Afghans in the U.S.
by issuing multiple-entry visas
for business travelers, students
and tourists.

Dozens of people have held a
lie-down protest in downtown
Detroit over a New York grand
jury's decision not to charge a
white police officer in the choke-

The decision Wednesday not

Teenagers testify
in student killing
MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -
Two teenagers testified Thurs-
day that they had stolen items
from the garage of a Montana
man accused of killing a high
school student in that very place
weeks later, and one of the teens
said that may have been one
factor that led to the German
exchange student's death.
Mykle Martin, 17, and Tristan
Staber, 18, described how they
went "garage hopping," or bur-
glarizing garages, in search of
alcohol and other things after
dark and hit Markus Kaarma's
house.
Kaarma is accused of baiting
the shooting victim, Diren Dede,
into sneaking into his garage
early April 27, and killing him
with four shotgun blasts after
being alerted by a motion detec-
tor. He has pleaded innocent to
deliberate homicide, citing fear
of harm to his family and prop-
erty after he'd been burglarized
twice before the shooting.

design or desire that we see a
Russia isolated through its own
actions."
MANAMA, Bahrain
Bahraini activist
jailed for insulting
king
A Bahraini court on Thursday
sentenced a prominent opposition
activist to three years in prison
for insulting the king after she
tore up the monarch's photo, her
lawyer said. The activist, Zainab
al-Khawaja, gave birth only a few
weeks earlier.
Al-Khawaja was also fined the
equivalent of around $8,000, law-
yer Mohammed al-Wasti told The
Associated Press.
Al-Khawaja is part of the Gulf
island monarchy's most promi-
nent opposition family. Her father
Abdulhadi al-Khawaja is serving
a life sentence for his role in 2011

greater rights from the Sunni-led
government. Her sister Maryam
was sentenced this week in absen-
tia to a year in prison on charges
of assaulting police. Maryam is

At Thursday's conference, sev-
eral speakers also stressed the
importance of college graduation
for building the economy and
strengthening the middle class,
and said the event would help
organize leaders to increase the
number of college graduates in
STEM fields, particularly women
and minorities.
At the event, every school lead-
er was asked to commit to work
on a specific problem in educa-
tion, such ascollegereadiness and
investing in academic advisers for
high school students. The Uni-
versity has opted to work toward
increasing the number of college

graduates working in the fields of
science, technology, engineering
and mathematics, an area Little
said the University plans to con-
tinue placing emphasis on in the
coming years.
As part of this initiative, Little
said the University of Michi-
gan-Dearborn plans to focus on
increasing the number of advi-
sors available to high school stu-
dents. They will partner with the
Michigan College Access Net-
work, a non-profit organization
whose mission is to increase col-
lege readiness, participation and
completion in Michigan.
"The goal is to increase the
percentage of students at the
effective schools who apply to
community college or universities
to 90 percent and to increase the
percentage of students who apply

for federal financial aid to 70 per-
cent," he said.
MCAN currently supports a
statewide network of 40 college
academic advisers available to
high school students, but follow-
ing Thursday's event, the organi-
zation hopes to reach 80 advisors.
Little said both the Dearborn
and Ann Arbor campuses are
committed to increasing college
attendance for disadvantaged stu-
dents, though the Dearborn cam-
pus has a much higher population
of low-income students.
"The percentage of students on
our campus who are Pell (Grant)
eligible is 44 percent," Little said.
"The Ann Arbor percentage is
something like 12 to 15 percent. A
much higher percentage of lower
income students attend the Dear-
born campus."

instead of a force trying to protect

the peace," Rohde said.
In recent months, police in
Ferguson, Mo. have used military
equipment, tear gas and other
riot gear to control protests in
the wake of the police shooting
of Michael Brown, a Black teen-
ager. Their use of force has drawn
criticism from a number of groups
in recent months, prompting
Amnesty International to send a
group of observers to the city to
monitor police.
Brown said University police
have not requested any equip-
ment from other federal grant
programs, and do not have any
equipment beyond standard issue

sidearms and long guns. Instead,
he said the University can bor-
row tactical equipment from the
county as needed, as well as coor-
dinate with other agencies like
the Michigan State Police Bomb
Squad in situations necessitating
higher security.
Universities across the country
have tightened security responses
in recent years following several
instances of mass shootings on
college campuses.
The Ann Arbor police said they
do not have documents listing
weapons or gear of military grade
received from the federal govern-
ment.

STARTUP
From Page 1
Yu said the program is
divided into three parts. Dur-
ing the first semester, members
of Startup High School visit
high schools, present to stu-
dents about the organization
and encourage them to submit
pitches through the group's
website. Pitches are accepted
on an individual basis.
The top 30 to 50 students
are selected to compete with
the ideas they pitched, which
leads to step two: a series of
entrepreneurship workshops
hosted by Startup High School
on a weekly basis to help the
students develop their projects
and prepare them for launch.
This year's workshops will
begin in February, though the
group is still trying to find a
central meeting location. Yu
said Startup High School mem-
bers might be dispersed indi-
vidually to teach workshops at
local centers given the expand-
ed audience.
At the program's end, the
students attend a final summit
where they present to apanelof
judges. The top five pitches are
awarded prize money.
Business sophomore Ovijit
Datta, another Startup High
School co-director, outlined
the criteria for a pitch's initial
selection into the program.
"We will look for what kind
of passion does this student
have?" he said. "Does he or
she have any credibility in this
area? What kind of (research
and development) is required
to create the service? Have they
ever engaged with this idea
before?"
One of the organization's
biggest goals, Datta said, is to
expand participants' percep-
tion of what it means to be an
entrepreneur.
"From textbooks, they kind
of learn that an entrepreneur is
someone who assumes risks in
the factors of production ... to
pursue a venture," he said. "But
that's really not the case. We
really want students to realize

that entrepreneurship exists
in all fields outside of just busi-
ness."
Yu added that Startup High
School encourages its high
school students to consider
entrepreneurship beyond
the stereotypical technology
project. He said the organiza-
tion stresses the importance
of social entrepreneurship as
well.
"We decided that the best
way that we could start is to
have a program where these
students have a chance to meet
real entrepreneurs, experience
entrepreneurial events," he
said. "And that was the origi-
nal inspiration. We're trying
to give, introduce those stu-
dents to entrepreneurship at
a young age so they can get a
head start."
Datta said last year's top
prize winners reflected Startup
High School's mission.
The first place pitch was
a text-to-speech application
that could understand other
languages, including English,
Spanish and Swahili, among
others, for the purpose of
classroom note-taking. It won
$2,000.
The second place pitch,
named "Paradise Valley,"
aimed to renovate an aban-
doned building in Metro
Detroit and convert it into a
music venue for high school
and college musicians for a
small annual membership fee.
"The scalability of the idea'
doesn't have to be that large
at first," Datta said. "They just
need to realize potential. And
we can help them realize that."
This year, Datta said MPow-
ered is trying to unite its
numerous branch organiza-
tions and integrate their mis-
sions because the ultimate goal
is to expose students to entre-
preneurship.
"I got involved in MPow-
ered because I love mentoring
others," he said. "I love see-
ing when I can help them start
from point A and end up at
point B. It's very remarkable to
see how they deyelop as a per-
son through their professional
skills."


CIVIL WAR
From Page 1
ogy literature suggests that group
violence helps establish cohesion
within militant groups. Gang
rape helps establish relationships
among the perpetrators and can
raise the status of perpetrators,
differentiating group perpetra-
tors from lone perpetrators.
"The basic point of the combat-
ant socialization argument is that
the desire for combatants who
have been forcedly recruited to
fit in is a powerful motivator for
participating in acts of group vio-
lence," Cohen said.
Fitting in is more about attain-
ing protection and access to shel-
ter during the conflict, she said.
Statistics from modern civil wars
show that civil wartime rape
by state and non-state actors is
associated with forms of forced

recruitment, which is in line with
her argument.
Cohen did research following
the wars in Sierra Leone, which
lasted from 1991 to 2002; East
Timor, which lasted from 1975
to 1999; and in El Salvador, a
war from 1979 to 1992. She inter-
viewed former combatants who
spoke to her about their experi-
ences in their respective con-
flicts, including their involvement
in sexual violence.
Her fieldwork yielded a num-
ber of different results, includ-
ing data demonstrating that most
reported rapes were public gang
rapes. Furthermore, there were
reports of gang rapes by both
sexes. There was also a positive
correlation between groups that
abducted most often and those
that raped most often. Finally,
rape was not usually ordered
by commanders, according to
Cohen's findings.
Cohen noted that the com-

batant socialization argument
is not absolute and that specific
background circumstances in
each case affect the occurrence
of rape. She added that societal
effects of mass rape during civil
war are very complicated and
hard to generalize.
Public Policy Prof. Melvyn
Levitsky, a former ambassador
and Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State for Human Rights during
the Reagan administration, said
the presentation offered him a
different perspective on causes of
rape during civil wars. Levitsky
said empowering governments
to prevent armed groups from
abducting people could certainly
help.
"I am intrigued by the research
from a policy standpoint that
seems to indicate there would be
very few tools to stem rape in this
intragroup conflicts, in the eth-
nic conflicts especially," Levitsky
said.

on Thursday.
PutiOn speec suggests

that by the time that termina-
tion letter arrived I was hired...
and I don't want you to say that
Salaita engaged in hate speech.
I very clearly did not engage in
hate speech."
Instead, he said, he would
prefer that people take defini-
tive stances on the issue.
"What I would *prefer for
you to do is simply be honest,
and say 'I hate Salaita's poli-
tics.I don't like his criticisms of
Israel, and therefore he should
have been fired'," he said. "It's
the dishonesty that bothers me.
more than the argument - it's
people refusing to take owner-
ship over their own positions."
On academic freedom in the
classroom, Salaita said there is
often an imbalance of emphasis
between how comfort of stu-
dents with majority identities
and students with minority
identities are considered. Salai-
ta said as an undergraduate he
often heard offensive language
from his professors that he dis-
agreed with.
"Not a single administrator
ever fretted about my comfort
in the classroom," Salaita said.
"Not a single administrator
ever fretted about the comfort
of a non-normative student in
the classroom. Enough of this
discomfort already. Enough.
What they're really saying is,
we don't want those who feel
invested economically or psy-
chologically with the majority
to feel any sort of discomfort."
LSA sophomore Mekarem
Eljamal, SAFE spokeswoman,
said they invited Salaita to the
University because they felt his
message of academic freedom
was particularly relevant in
light of the group's UMDivest
campaign.
SAFE's campaign calls for
the University to divest from

several businesses they allege
supporthumanrightsviolations
against Palestinians because of
their contracts with the Israeli
military. Last year, the group
primarily pursued the initia-
tive through a resolution before
Central Student Government,
which ultimately failed. The
resolution was accompanied by
several large-scale protests and
accusations that voices were
being silenced on campus after
CSG initially declined to vote on
the resolution.
"I hope that (the Univer-
sity community) sees the con-
nection of what happened to
students last year on campus,
what's been happening around
the country" Eljamal said. "It's
not just administrations and
students, or student govern-
ments, but it's administrations
and professors and it hasa dev-
astating impact on careers."
Salaita also touched on
broader views of academic
activism. In response to a ques-
tion from the audience, he said
becoming engaged in politics is
a choice based on both personal
cost and an individual's values.
"You have to think about
where you're at inlifeboth eco-
nomically and personally and
emotionally," he said. "And I say
emotionally because it's hard
sometimes, engaging in politi-
cal issues, for all sides. You hear
things about yourself that you
don't want to hear... it can be
a hard commitment. It can be
unbelievably rewarding also."
LSA sophomore Lamees
Mekkaoui, who attended the
event, said she took away a
heightened awareness about
issues surrounding academic
freedom and academia.
"I thought he brought a very
real tone to something that
hasn't really been talked about
- academic dissent is basically
an untouched field," Mekka-
oui said. "He really brought it
to the table and opened up the
conversation."

Russian president
speaks amid falling
oil prices, economy
MOSCOW (AP) - Russia will
defend its geopolitical inter-
ests, President Vladimir Putin
warned Thursday as he prom-
ised economic reforms to pull
his country back from the brink
of recession. But Putin's patri-
otic bluster and vague promises
did little to assuage real fears
that Western sanctions, plum-
meting oil prices and a collaps-
ing ruble are crippling Russia's
economy.
In his annual state-of-
the-nation address at the
Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin
announced measures to spur
the country'sflagging economy,
which is set to enter recession
in 2015 for the first time in six
years.
"The quality and size of the
Russian economy must corre-

spond to our geopolitical and
historical role," Putin said. "We
must get out of this zero-growth
trap and in the next three or
four years raise our growth to
above-average global levels."
Putin proposed a three-
year freeze on tax inspections
for companies as well as a tax
amnesty for money brought
back to Russia from abroad. But
in a disappointment to inves-
tors, he offered no broader plan
for pulling Russia out of its eco-
nomic downturn.
"His freedom of maneuver is
limited now and many impor-
tant economic factors no longer
depend on him: the ruble rate,
the price. of oil, inflation," said
Moscow-based analyst Maria
Lipman. "No matter what Putin
says, whether he sounds con-
ciliatory and reassuring or bel-
licose and threatening, this
would not affect those basic
factors."
Putin spent much of his
speech blaming his country's

economic woes on the West,
which he accused of wanting to
dismember Russia like Yugosla-
via, which broke up amid wars
in the 1990s. Putin said the
United States and Europe would
have imposed sanctions and
found other pretexts for hold-
ing Russia back even if tensions
had not erupted in Ukraine this
year.
"The politics of containment
were not invented yesterday....
The more we retreat and jus-
tify ourselves;the more brazen
our opponents become and the
more cynically and aggres-
sively they behave," Putin said,
adding that "no one will suc-
ceed in defeating Russia mili-
tarily."
He blamed the volatility of the
ruble, which has lost about 40
percent of its value against the
dollar this year, on speculators,
and praised the Russian central
bank's decision to allow the cur-
rency to floatfreely. The ruble fell
further as he spoke.

The matter of intention

D ear faculty, administration, students
and squirrels of the University of
Michigan,
I think about time almost
constantly. It's a strange con-
cept to me, as both ahard sci-
ence major and a human with
limited days here on Earth.
With a significant milestone
for many of us coming up
next week as winter gradu-
ation takes place, I'd like to
trick the kind and smart edi-A
tors of The Michigan Daily JULIA
into thinking this paragraph ZARINA
is the beginning of a serious
and thoughtful reflection on
some pressing political issues
we've experienced in my time at school here.
Now that they've stopped reading and/or
slipped into an irreversible coma due to bore-
dom, I'd like to use the rest of this final column
as an opportunity to reflect on and attempt to
explain a few things unique to the University.
of Michigan that defy our human understand-
ing and challenge us both as engineers and as
philosophical beings.
Without further ado, I present to you: a
freshman engineer's survival guide to the
supernatural phenomenasof North Campus.
The dark navigational sorcery of
GG Brown
Welcome to college! It is your first day of
class. You stand anxious and excited in the
middle of the North Campus Diag, backpack
strapped on tight, class schedule clasped in
hand, and notice that your first discussion of
the day - the first day of the rest of your life! -
is located in a building called GG Brown. Cool!
You casually ask a passing upperclassman for
directions to the classroom and are met with
an empty stare and the echoes of a haunting
response: "Any room in GG Brown can only be
found bythose who already know where it is."
You are entering the Bermuda Triangle of
North Campus, a building designed from some-
body's twisted fever dream of an M.C. Escher
house; a labyrinth of rooms that appear to be
numbered according to some obscure permu-
tation of a Fibonacci sequence; and wall maps
that have no building blueprint but simply say,
"follow your heart." Desperate to escape the
maze, you sprint toward a faint glimmer of
daylight, flinging open door after door in infi-
nite hallways that lead back to places you have
already been. Who knows how much time has
passed for the ones you left behind? It could be
days. Weeks. Millennia. Society as you know it
may have ceased to exist. You have gazed long
enough into the abyss for it to have gazed back
into you and you will emerge with a renewed
appreciation for the fleeting nature of mortal
life.
Weeks later you'll real-
ize that this whole ordeal
transpired in the span of 14 But someh
seconds when you acciden- thing youi
tallywandered into auutiity i
closetinstead ofastairwell is go back t
This revelation will leave
you equally, if not more, beginnin
perplexed and terrified. -i all
The localized space-
time anomaly known as
"syllabus week"
Ah, syllabus week. The leisurely five days
revered by all college students for the inclu-
sion of stimulating class activities that include
hearing about every degree your professor has
ever received or contemplated receiving and
doing absolutely nothing else. In engineering,
it's exactly the same. Syllabus week is a joyous,
pleasant walk in the park for literally seconds
on end until it abruptly comes to a halt within
the first three minutes of the semester.
After briefly recapping some previously
learned technical material including, but not
limited to, "shapes that are not triangles" and
the song small children use to memorize the
names of the 50 states, you will be launched
directlyinto higher order differential equations
with a force that defies any law of physics you
have ever, or will ever, study in your time here.

But the ego boost you received in those 30
seconds of finally understanding everything
your professor was saying will sustain you well
into exam week.
Exam week is another unusual instance of
obvious space-time warpage on North Campus
that Neil deGrasse Tyson should really do
an investigative TV special about. Here, we
experience a completely different kind of time
warp wherein, instead of lasting a bafflingthree
and a half minutes, the aforementioned "week"
stretches from approximately the second week
of school until four, possibly five, years later
when you graduate.
The mystic inspiration of last-minute
panic
It's the beginning of the semester and
you're on top of your shit. You're proactive!
You're doing homework well in advance of the
deadline! This is the year everything will be
different! You've even read all your textbooks,
which is no small feat considering reading is
an extremely complex process that involves
removing a book from its shrink-wrapped
cocoon and exposing the front cover directly
to light rays for the scientifically accepted
maximum exposure period of 17 secondsabefore
finding a permanent home for it on the floor of
your bedroom where you will, ideally, never
come in contact with it again.
For the most part, everything is going fine.
Until suddenly, somehow, it's three hours
before your final project deadline, the code
you've been writing for weeks is not, in any way,
working, andyoufindyourselfonthethirdfloor
of the Dude in a sleep-deprived haze, thanking
automatic doors for opening for you. You will
have no memory of who you are or how you
got there but you will be propelled by a deep,
caffeine-fueled impulse to find one, single open
CAEN computer on this campus, goddamnit.
Days later, your friends, concerned for your
emotional and physical well-being, will find you
in a whirlwind of graph paper and two-day-old
pizza crusts, hunched over the pixelated light
of a monitor, muttering in tongues and divining
lines of code like the ancient oracle receiving a
prophecy from some silicon-powered deity.
Your efforts will not have been in vain. You
will most likely emerge from said endeavors
with some kind of primitive but functional
robot device - a five-day-old banana attached
to a wheel - that looks like it was forged in the
fires of a middle school science fair volcano and
may be powered by human tears. Sixty percent
of the time, it will work every time.
The inexplicable, logic-defying desire to
do it all again
It's some period of time greater than three
but less than 12 years later and you finally did it.
You're graduating! You are 20-something years
old in human years, which is approximately
48 years old in engineer
years due to a non-
only trivial conversion factor
)w the y caused by extreme sleep
want to do deprivation and abysmal
diet. Industry-mandated
o the very engineering factors of
safety at your next job are
lg and do higher than your GPA and
you've become intimately
igain. familiar with the best and
worst crying spots in each
campus library.
Butsomehow the only thing you want to do is
go back to the very beginning and do it all again.
As a senior graduating next week, I can report
firsthand that it is a very real phenomenon that
defies logic and understanding and one that I
will have to leave to far wiser minds than mine
to explain. If you figure it out, let me know.
I'll be circling the halls of GG Brown in my
banana-mobile, looking for a wormhole to take
me back to that first, anxious, excited day of
freshman year.
So for today, goodbye. For tomorrow, good
luck. Forever (until the ultimate end of exam
"week" a.k.a. the end of time as we know it), Go
Blue.

Imagine you arrive at your local
town hall for a meeting. In this
meetingyou will need to createvery
specific architectural and logistical
plans for building three houses in
your community. The meeting will
last exactly one hour and contain
20 three-minute-long speaker slots.
Out of the 100 people that show up
to the meeting, roughly 20 of them
are either architects or experienced
homeowners. When starting the
meeting the first question is: Given
the limited speaker times, who
should we let speak? Well, the'
answer is simple: If the meeting
is going to be successful, then
people who have experience in
home building (i.e. experts) should
talk. The experts should be given
the time to speak because their
experience and knowledge is
valuable in creating an effective
plan. This decision seems intuitive,
right? Well, then why do we deny
this logical conclusion when we talk
about race and racial experiences in
America? My fellow white people, I
think it is time we had atalk.
Oftentimes when I hear my fellow
white people talk about Black racial
injustice, I hear them take offense to
the idea that they should not speak.
I often find that white people are
angered by the idea that they should
not be part of the dominant voice
when it comes to improving the
experience of Black people in Amer-
ica. I hear white people get angry
when they are told not to instruct
Black people on how to protest,
handle their emotions, or "improve"
their situation. Well white people,
while your anger may be real, it isn't
logically justified. Why?
Well, first we must recognize that
in a world with limited resources
and social space, some people are
more qualified than others to speak.
Generally, we have to think of social
interactions and space as finite
resources. In society, we see there
are only so many voices the media,
lawmakers and people in general
can hear and process. Therefore,
we face economic decisions around
who gets to speak. When we apply
this concept to systemic racial
injustice, it becomes evident that as
a white-passing man, my emotions,
thoughts, and feelings around racial
issues are not as important as Black
voices for the same reason why the
home-building experts should be

the ones speaking at the town hall
meeting.
Simply put, the people best able
to speak on the issues involved with
Black injustice are Black. Black peo-
ple face the discrimination that is
being discussed. Black people have
a common narrative and history of
oppression that is vital in under-
standing the issue of racial injus-
tice towards Black people. By living
through this oppression and these
shared experiences, by sharing this
common history, Black people have
a more dynamic and informed view
of the Black racial injustices plagu-
ing America than someone who is
not Black. Black people contribute
valuable data, perspectives and
solutions that are grounded in real-
ity. In general, we shouldn't give the
limited and valuable social space
to people who are not qualified to
speak. White people should be quiet
when talking about racial injustice
for the same reason why we silence
an inexperienced community mem-
ber when we need to discuss how to
build a house. That is, society can't
waste its limited social space on an
opinion which contributes nothing
or is based in conjecture.
But someone might say: "Isn't it
racist to silence people just because
they are white?" Well no, it isn't.
We have to think about racism
through a functional perspective
to fully understand why we have
the idea of racism in the first place.
Functionally, racism is defined as
the systematic and institutional
discrimination of a person or group
of people due to their race, when
their race holds no relevance. We
functionally use the idea of racism
to denote injustice and prejudice.
This definition recognizes racial
differences, but understands that
discrimination arbitrarily based on
those differences is wrong. It isn't
racist to tell white people to be quiet
about Black racial injustice because
white people aren't qualified to
speak about the Black experience
and the emotions associated with
living that oppression every day.
White people cannot provide
that dynamic and valuable data
and perspective that will lead to
getting a nuanced understanding
of racial issues. Someone isn't
being prejudiced or unjust when
they silence white people because
race IS relevant in deciding who

vs. impact
is most qualified to speak about
Black oppression and experiences.
You wouldn't hire a prospective
employee who has no experience
building houses to build your home.
This isn't discrimination because
their experience is relevant in
deciding if you should hire them.
To apply this argument further,
we must not only think of how qual-
ified we are to speak on issues, but
how our intentions and words actu-
ally translate into the social land-
scape. Essentially, this is amatter of
intention vs. impact. While I truly
believe that most white people don't
want to be racist, they end up being
functionally racist. Their words
combine with realities of the social
systems of our society and become
problematic. When a white person
changes #blacklivesmatter to #all-
livesmatter we can infer that their
intention is to show that all lives
are valuable regardless of race. The
intention behind this is to lessen
racism. However, when white peo-
ple say #alllivesmatter, they move
the discussion away from Black
oppression, and unintentionally uti-
lize their social capital (power) to
allocate the limited social space to a
discussion ofthe existence, morality
and ethics of racism in the context
of idealism, rather than the neces-
sary discussion of how to navigate
Black oppression and racial injus-
tice that is grounded in the context
of reality. This holds true for the
#notallmen hashtag as well.. It is
obvious that all men aren't rapists.
However, when men say #notall-
men, they unintentionally utilize
their social capital (power) to drive
the conversation away from gender
inequality and rape culture, to a dis-
cussion about the existence, moral-
ity and ethics of sexismin a way that
uses idealism to inform discussion,
rather than recognizing that sexism
and rape culture is a demonstrably
proven reality, and moving forward
to discuss concrete ways to fix it.
As white people (and agent
groups in general) it's. imperative
that we recognize the socialrealities
of our society and our qualifications
to speak if we are to ever truly rid
society of racial and oppression in
general.

Center programming board member.

For marginaliZed students, a painful path

0

l
a

When I was 13 years old, I
found out a huge family secret: I
am Native.
I had always wondered why my
skin was darker than my white
friends'. But my light-skinned
grandparents kept the explanation
under wraps for years. Living dur-
ing a time when our Native heritage
would do a disservice to us, they hid
the knowledge in an attempt to pro-
tect us from stigma and shame.
My grandparents' fears were
neither unfounded nor uncommon.
The narrative of Native history in
this country is one of forced assimi-
lation - a deliberate effort to strip
us of the language, traditions and
culture that have united and sus-
tained us for generations. Decades
of systemic oppression have taught
Native families that their culture,
their customs and their beliefs have
no place in American society.
After I learned my true origins,
I paid much closer attention to
the dialogue happening - or, in
many cases, not happening -
around privilege and access to
opportunity. Even at fairly diverse
and progressive institutions like the
University, I found that many of my
well-meaning classmates had never
been exposed to the nuances of the
struggles facing Native and other
marginalized communities.
But this lack of exposure was not
unique to the University. All across
the country, few people of color are
in positions of authority and power.
This leads to startling disparities
in all sorts of rates that measure
health, wealth, happiness and
future prospects for low-income
families and people of color. To me,
some of the most alarming statistics
play out in education.
The diversityof the teachingforce

in this country does not reflect the
diversity of the students it serves.
This becomes even more problem-
atic in light of the fact that students
of color face such limited educa-
tional opportunities compared to
their white counterparts. While
great teachers come from all back-
grounds (I had many with whom I
did not share an identity), research
and reason tells us that kids benefit
when they get the chance to learn
from leaders who look like them. In
a society that tells certain groups
of children not to associate success
with the places they come from and
faces that look like theirs, working
with a role model every day who
embodies a marginalized identity is
among the best ways to give power
to our students.
It was with this in mind that I
joined Teach For America after I
graduated from the University. I
wanted to empower kids to embrace
who they are and take pride in their
heritage, regardless of what society
says they should feel when they
look in the mirror. I teach primarily
Latino students in Denver who
have been talked at and about in
conversations surrounding their
education, but have rarely been
included in the conversation.
My students need to know that
this isn't right. They have to feel
that they control their stories,
and that their lives should not be
predetermined by their zip codes
or parents' paychecks. For my
students, I know I have to make
more than surface-level changes,
like swapping out the examples
of "ice cream cones" for "tacos"in
word problems. Ihave to show them
that they have value just as they are
and that their experiences bring
much needed perspective and new

ideas to the world.
Teach For America is working
hard to increase diversity in the
teacher workforce and develop
advocates for equity, but there
is still work to be done. Being a
Teach For America corps member
of color has not been easy, and I
have faced many of the frustrations
around privilege and access that I
did as a student at the University.
The necessity of voices that point
out these issues, however, is what
keeps me in this movement. As a
corps member, I advocate to make
our professional development ses-
sions as inclusive as possible. I call
out ideas that could feel insensi-
tive to marginalized groups, even
when the speaker didn't intend
them to be. I use my own struggles
with identity to encourage others
to consider ways they can be more
inclusive and responsive to their
kids' unique needs. This work can
be uncomfortable, but the more we
talk about these realities, leverage
our own experiences and push one
another to expand our thinking, the
better off our kids will be.
Empoweringkids isthe bestway I
knowto make sure my grandparents'
shame was not in vain. This Native
Heritage Month and throughout
the year, I am fighting to make sure
other kids don't have to feel the
inner turmoil and confusion that I
did. As you reflect on how to honor
the heritage of your own ancestors
- whatever that may be - and help
create a world that is more equal
than the one they knew, I hope
the opportunity to foster the next
generation of leaders is one you'll
consider.

Let's talk about Ferguson

Police cases across nation
inspire host of protests

ts now been a week and a half
since the Ferguson ruling.
The issue has been dis-
cussed by a
variety of peo-
ple from mul-
tiple angles,
but I want us to
have one final'
discussion. We
won't turn this
into a heated
debate or a hos-
tile environ- MCHE
ment. Instead, SCHRAMM
I want every-
one to have one
calm, cool and collected opportu-
nity to hear why so many believe
the case is racially driven and
.speaks volumes about racism in
America. If you can't fathom why
the case is racist, just keep an
open mind in thinking through
some of the points I want to make.
First, let's talk about Ferguson
itself. It's a predominantly Black
citywithtwo-thirds of the town's
population being African Ameri-
can. While that's 66 percent of
the population, only one member
out of six on the city council is
Black. Three Black police officers
serve on'a 53-person staff, and
Blacks account for 86 percent of
vehicle stops in the town.
Now, let's talk about police
officer Darren Wilson's recount-
ing of the story. He starts by say-
ing he heard about a robbery of
cigarillos from a store. Later, he
sees Michael Brown and a friend
walking in the road, asks him to
walk on the sidewalk, and Brown
replies "fuck what you have to
say." Wilson proceeds to stop the
car, asks Brown to come over, and
Brown heads to the car. But he
doesn't simply head to the car -
Brown then slams the door shut
on Wilson and begins punching
him through the open driver's
window. Then, mid-fight, Brown
proceeds to stop punching Wil-
son to hand over the stolen ciga-
rillos that Wilson heard were
previously stolen. Using this
time to recover, Wilson grabs
his gun, points it at Brown, and
Brown replies "You're too much
of a fucking pussy to shoot me;"
After fighting for control over
the gun, Wilson fires a shbt that
sends Brown running. After this,
Brown comes charging back to
Wilson, puts his right hand into
his waistband (implying Wil-
son believes Brown had a gun),
and refuses to get on the ground
per Wilson's instructions. This
causes Wilson to fire six shots
into Brown.
Doesn't this story sound a little
strange to you?
I'll highlight some commen-
tary made in a Vox article. Why
would Brown, someone who
recently stole cigarillos from a
store, act so aggressively non-
compliant with a police officer
wanting him to simply walk on
the sidewalk? Why does Brown
- mid-fight - decide that it's a

wise decision to stop fighting to
hand his friend the stolen ciga-
rillos in front of a police officer?
Why would Brown antagonize an
intimidated officer to shoot him?
Why would Brown reach into his
waistband to pull out a gun when
evidence indicated that Brown
never had a gun? It almost seems
that Wilson is trying to connect
Brown with the theft and frame
him as particularly dangerous in
an attempt to justify his actions.
Furthermore, numerous eye-
witness accounts contradict Wil-
son's claims - including whether
Brown charged Wilson when the
gun was fired.
Let's also not forget that
there's evidence directly con-
tradicting Wilson's statements.
Brown was shot 150 feet from the
car as opposed to the 10-foot dis-
tance Wilson claimed separated
them. Brown's DNA was also dis-
covered in Wilson's car, contra-
dictingthe testimony thatWilson
and Brown's altercation occurred
with Brown outside the car.
Does any of this definitively
prove that Wilson shot Brown
due to race? No. But let's think
things through. This is a town
where a few whites rule a major-
ity of Blacks. Wilson is a man
who previously belonged to a
police force disbanded for racial
tension. His recounting of events
is bizarre at best, and evidence
directly contradicts his claims.
Given the facts, it certainly
seems likely that race played
a factor.
Notice how I'm not saying rac-
ism was the sole factor. I'm not
asserting Wilson thought "I'm
going to shoot this man because
he's Black." However, lying
somewhere between Brown's
conscious and subconscious lays
our society's purported notion
that Blacks are more threaten-
ing than whites. I believe that
if we could repeat the situation
with 50 Michael Browns and 50
white counterparts, more of the
Black men would be dead than
the whites.
I'm not unsupported in believ-
ing this. In America, young Black
men are 21 times more likely to be
shot dead by police officers than
youngwhite men.
That's an indicator of institu-
tionalized racism - subtle racism
that's facilitated by policies and
practices that are particularly
harmful to minorities. Institu-
tional racism happens all around
us. The same applies to the Fer-
guson case. The police system
isn't intended to harm African
Americans more, but statistically,
it does.
We also see evidence of insti-
tutional racism in the judicial
proceedings of this case. Despite
evidence contradicting Wil-
son's statement, he wasn't even
tried because the court failed
to indict him - something that
happened in only 11 cases out of
162,000 in 2010. Wilson didn't

need to be poven guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt for an indict-
ment. All that's needed to be
indicted is a legal threshold of
probable cause. Given this, in a
public statement, the National
Bar Association couldn't under-
stand how a jury couldn't indict
Wilson. The details behind the
case don't match the indictment
decision - something that could
be explained by the rejection that
institutional racism exists.
Let's just assume Wilson was
indicted and the case did go to
court. Does evidence exist to
declare Wilson as guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt? Honestly, I
don't know, and I could very well
see there not being evidence to
prove murder. "
Institutional racism is one of
the hardest things to prove, but
does that make the situation any
better? Enough evidence exists
to believe Brown's death was
influenced by race. It speaks to
how easily racism can occur in
our society with almost no reper-
cussions, and that in itself is dis-
heartening.
But let's take this further. Let's
assume the evidence indicating
this case as racist isn't actually
pertinent. What if Wilson wasn't
being racist?
It doesn't matter.
Because this case didn't occur
in a vacuum. It fits under the
enormous umbrella of cases
where race could have been a
factor in a shooting. Remember
Trayvon Martin? Cases where
death is potentially race-driven
happen frequently (remember
that Black men are 21 times more
likely to be shot dead than white
men?) It doesn't matter whether
Wilson definitively shot Brown
due to racism; it just matters that
there's a reasonable possibility.
If it didn't happen in this case,
there are hundreds of others,
and it is happening in some of
them. What's worse is that this
form of injustice is designed to
go unpunished.
This case speaks to the larger
societal problem that Blacks
encounter more frequent and
horrific police encounters, which
speaks to the even larger problem
that racist undertones exist in
our society.
That's why this case is so
important: not only does it reveal
fundamental flaws on a micro
level, but it's a huge problem on
a macro level revealing the exis-
tence of institutional racism.
I make absolutely no claims
that I can understand the hard-
ships that Blacks are experienc-
ingwhile mourningthe Ferguson
case. However, from observ-
ing the pain, riots and injustice
felt in the community, I feel the
responsibility lies on more than
just African Americans to speak
on this case.

Police brutality,
racial profiling
topics of concern
NEW YORK (AP) - From the
White House to the streets of
some of America's biggest cities,
the New York chokehold case
converged with the Ferguson
shooting and investigations out
of South Carolina and Cleveland
to stir a national conversation
Thursday about racial justice and
police use of force.
A day after a grand jury
cleared a white New York City
officer in the death of a black
man, civil rights leaders pinned
their hopes on a promised fed-
eral investigation. Demonstra-
tors protested for a second night
in New York, carrying replicas
of coffins across the Brooklyn
Bridge, and turned out in such
cities as Denver, Detroit and
Minneapolis. And politicians and
others talked about the need for
better police training, body cam-
eras and changes in the grand
jury process to restore faith in the
legal system.
"A whole generation of officers
will be trained in a new way,"
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio
vowed as he and his police com-
missioner outlined previously
announced plans to teach officers
how to communicate better with
people on the street.
President Barack Obama
weighed in, saying one of the
chief issues at stake is "making
sure that people have confidence
that police and law enforcement
and prosecutors are serving
everybody equally."
Even before the decision in
the Eric Garner case came down,
racial tensionswere runninghigh
because of last week's grand jury
decision not to charge a white
officer in the shooting death of
black 18-year-old Michael Brown
in Ferguson, Missouri.

Other cases were added to the
mix on Thursday:
- In the tiny South Carolina
town of Eutawville, a white for-
mer police chief was charged
with murder in the 2011 shoot-
ing of an unarmed black man.
Richards Combs' lawyer accused
prosecutors of taking advantage
of national outrage toward police
to obtain the indictment more
than three years after the killing.
- InCleveland,theU.S.Justice
Department and the city reached
an agreement to overhaul the
police department after federal
investigators found that officers
use excessive force far too often,
causing deep mistrust, especially
among blacks. The investigation
was prompted chiefly by a 2012
police ar chase that ended in the
deaths of two unarmed people in
alhail of137bullets.
Just last week, protesters took
to the streets of Cleveland after a
white police officer shot and killed
a black 12-year-old boy carrying
what turned out to be pellet gun.
At a news conference in New
York after a night of protests led
to 83 arrests, the Rev. Al Sharp-
ton called the state-level grand
jury system "broken" when it
comes to police brutality cases
and urged federal authorities to
fix it. %
"The federal government must
do in the 21st century what it did
in the mid-20th century," he said.
"Federal intervention must come
now and protect people from
state grand juries."
Still, federal civil rights
cases against police officers are
exceedingly rare.
In the past two decades, only
a few such cases have reached
trial in New York - most notably
the one involving Abner Loui-
ma, who was sodomized with a
broom handle in a police station
in 1997. Several other high-profile
cases didn't come together.
That's largely because federal
prosecutors must meet a high

standard of proof in showing that
police deliberately deprived vic-
tims of their civil rights through
excessive force, said Alan Vine-
grad, who as a federal prosecutor
handled the Louima case.
Federal intervention "doesn't
happen often and it shouldn't
happen often," said James
Jacobs, a constitutional law pro-
fessor at New York University
Law School. "They should only
step in when the local prosecu-
tion was a sham."
Activists have claimed that the
grand jury investigation of Gar-
ner's death was indeed a sham.
An amateur video showed Officer
Daniel Pantaleo putting Garner
in an apparent chokehold, and the
medical examinersaidthe maneu-
ver contributed to the death.
But Pantaleo's attorney, Stuart
London, expressed confidence
Thursday that his client won't
face federal prosecution.
"There's very specific guide-
lines that are not met in this
case," London said. "This is a reg-
ular street encounter. It doesn't
fall into the parameters."
Acting at the Staten Island dis-
trict attorney's request, a judge
released a few details Thursday
from the grand jury proceedings
- among other things, it watched
four videos and heard from 50 wit-
nesses,22ofthemcivilians.District
Attorney DanielDonovandidn't ask
for testimony, transcripts or exhib-
its to be madepublic.
But London offered some
details, saying the officer's tes-
timony focused on "his remorse
and the fact that he never meant
to harm Mr. Garner that day."
Pantaleo admitted he heard
Garner say, "I can't breathe," but
believed that once he got him'
down on the ground and put him
on his side, he would be revived
by paramedics, London said. The
officer also testified that he "used
atakedown moveand anycontact
to the neck was incidental," the
lawyer added.

NEEL SWAMY I
, The Team, the Team and a Victim

When it comes to athletics,
there's no denying that the Uni-
versity of Michigan - a school
known for the eardrum-shatter-
ingscreams of its students during
football games and the torrential
sea of maize and blue that adorns
our campus on a daily basis - is
encompassed by a level of spirit
that exceeds no bounds. Indeed,
one hardly has to flutter an eyelid
to find themselves surrounded by
a highly pervasive and inclusive
passion for the Big House and the
Victors who proudly call it home.
One only has to look around to
see that at the University, athlet-
ics are more than a form of relax-
ation and entertainment. Here at
the University, athletics - partic-
ularly football - are worshipped,
revered and glorified.
And while I will be the first to
admit that this level of passion
marks one of the many allur-
ing features of our university -
because let's be honest, what's
a college without its students
- I cannot help but feel that
our faithfulness to our athletic
department and the individuals
who compose it has the malig-
nant potential to render us apa-
thetic towards those who fall
outside it or in some way chal-
lenge it.
On Nov. 16, newspapers and
media companies all over the
country entered a state of insa-

tiable frenzy upon learning of
the arrest of former defensive
end player Frank Clark, who had
been charged with domestic vio-
lence and assault after report-
edly beating his girlfriend in an
Ohio hotel. Police reports indi-
cate that Clark, a senior, spent
the night behind bars until being
arraigned on the morning of Nov.
17. Clark was suspended from the
team that same day.
Rightfully so.
But despite the degree to
which the legal reports cen-
ter around the victim - who
through her altercation with
Clark was rendered unconscious
and sustained several bruises on
her face - the media coverage of
the event has been overwhelm-
ingly limited to the football team.
As far as local newspapers are
concerned, Clark's actions have
affected nobody but his team-
mates. As far as local newspapers
are concerned, the victim of this
altercation - who because of
Clark will bear the rusty chains
of self-blame and psychologi-
cal trauma - represents nothing
less than an additional obstacle
for The Team to overcome. This
news coverage indirectly and
directly diminishes the sever-
ity of Clark's crime, and propels
the message that we, as students,
should be concerned more about
the team than our peers.

The lessons taken away from
domestic violence cases do not
stpp being absorbed with the
prosecution of the perpetrator.
It's through the victim's experi-
ences that we as a society can
recognize the epidemic that is
relationship violence, and it's
through an analysis of our own
values that we can propel for-
ward and thus promote an envi-
ronment that's intolerant of
such hostilities. Clark's crime
deserves attention not because of
his status as a football player, but
because of the pain it has trig-
gered throughout our campus.
Our actions are hardly justified
by our position in society, and
thus we must view Clark not as a
god to be revered, but as a male
figure who surrendered his mas-
culinity by committing the worst
of crimes. Football players - and
all athletes for that matter - are
not representative of our stu-
dent body. This is not to say that
we should boycott the sport or
refuse to attend games because of
this incident - this maneuver is
both immature and deprecating
to the entire university as a whole
- but rather consider the degree
to which we glorify the game and
its players. It's important to rec-
ognize that there's more to our
campus than The Team.

Improv group
presents 'Kardashian
through the Snow!'
By FRANCESCA KIELB
DailyArts Writer
I walk in to the ComCo warm
ups to find a group of students
dancing to "Shake Dat Thing"
while making
strobes out of ComCO
the lights in
Angel Audito- presents:
rium A. When Kardashian
I explain that
I am at the through
warm up for the Snow!
Friday's show
to ask a few Friday, Dec. 5
questions, 800 Ad. e
they explain $2g
that they are
busy working,
but that I can sit and observe until
they are done. I sit silently with
my pen and paper out, watching
them slumber-party style mime to
"Glamorous," pretending to write
something of hard-hitting journal-
istic value.
It didn't take long to realizethat
the improv group was improv-ing
on me. An hour before the doors
open for the show, they gather into
a circle to do somethingthat,to my
untrained eye, closely resembled
"Stomp The Yard." They clap and
stomp to a beat, going around in a
circle making rhymes. I presume
this is an exercise to prepare the
actors for the fast pace of improve
skits, or some kind of war dance.
Practicing improv is different
from other performance rehears-
als in that they cannot actually
prepare any content, only format.
For example, one of their games
involves taking an adjective sug-
gestion from a member on one side
of the audience and a noun from
a member on the other side, and
combining them to make a movie
title. The twdt inCo playtr thit
volunteer then have to act out that
movie, while a third member (the
'director') tells them to change
genres on the spot (i.e. "now' make

it ahorror movie,""now make it an
opera").On performance night,the
words andgenres forthe warmup
round will be completely different
from the actual show, but it gets
the actors accustomed to making
on the spot decisions.
"Alex and I always go to the
bathroom before the show. It's
important, " said LSA freshman
Kelsey Fox. "It's become a tradi-
tion," added LSA sophomore Alex
George.
"Basically we just try to get
our energy up, and pass emotions
between each other," Fox contin-
ued. "I think it's important when
you are going into a show to get
out of your head, so I try to remind
myself that I don't need to prepare
or bring anythingwith me."
However, there are plenty of
challenges that the actors must
face.
"You get inside your own head
a little bit," said LSA Junior Mike
Duczynski. "There are occasion-
ally still the rough parts where
you go out there and the spot is on
and you are really supposed to say
something hilarious and it could
knock the scene out of the park ...
and you just have no idea what to
say, and that's the worst. Even then
though we just sort of laugh."
"Theideathatyouneed to letgo
of everything in your head," Fox
said.
"Fallinginto patterns taking the
same characters, letting it become
too formulaic," Duczynskisaid.
Favorite characters to play?
Fox: "I often end up as an
old Jewish man. I really have to
remind myself to stop being an
old Jewish man. I imagine him as
an older gentleman - he's home-
less butvery well spoken." He then
continued to do the voice for five
minutes.
"So just like that," said LSA
sophomore Aaron Hellman.
"Ithinkthat one easyway tonot
fall into the same character again
and again orthe same shtick is that
when you get a siggestion from
the audience sometimes you have
a first impulse of what road to go
downandyousort of double check
that in your mind. If you normally

choose anger in a scene, pick a dif-
ferent emotion,"Sherman said.
"The audience is aimostexpect-
ing your first reaction so if you
come up with something different
that's usually where the funniness
comes from,"said LSA senior Dan-
iel Markowitz.
On that note, what makes a
show particularly funny? "When
we had really big and really good
crowds - the energy is symbiotic,"
said Ross senior John Dennehy.
"The best scenes are when you
both buy in completely and no one
is driving it, and you are like 'oh
shit' and you are falling over the
edge of a cliff but the ground is still
there but you are still falling," he
continued.
"Yes, the best scenes are usually
whenyouare on the edge of a cliff,"
said LSA senior Guy Madjar.
"Hanging off by your neck,"
Sherman added.
"Yes, ComCo practices in the
U.P.," said Madjar.
Have you ever had anything go
wrongin askit?
Sherman: "Someone was shot
once."
Sherman: "Yeah, on stage."
Markowitz: "That was soooo
awkward,"
Markowitz: "I do miss Carol."
Markowitz: "She was less bul-
letproof than she was funny."
Sherman:"The carpethadtoget
completelyredone."
Sherman: "Yeah, I wouldn't
perform anywhere near this part
of the stage for like a whole three
shows."
Dennehy: "It was like the M in
the diag we justwalked around it."
Markowitz: "So ... does that
answer your question?"
On average, it took me five sec-
onds too long to realize they were
kidding, but when asked what the
best part ofimprov was I got asur-
prisinglytouching answer:
"WhatIlike aboutimprovisthat
nobody owns anything, I think
that if you say something hilarious
its just asmuchbecaiseyour pant
ner set you up as it is because you
thought of something funny," said
Fox. There was apause.
"What she said."

Stories like Adichie's,
FOLLOW ON TWITTER and the diverse background
that contributes to them,
*are infinitely important,
especially given the cur-
rent state of feminism in the
@MICHICANDAILY "nited States. It's danger-
ously easy for feminists to
get stuck in one narrative;
many of the most vocal and

impactful modern voices of
feminism come from cookie
cutter backgrounds: white,
upper-class, American, het-
erosexual. Feminist organiza-
tions have an alarming habit
of limiting minority voices.
First wave feminists like .
Alice Paul only allowed Black
women to participate in the
Women's Suffrage Movement
if they worked and marched
separately from the white
women and men; Author and
activist Rita Mae Brown very
publicly quit the National
Organization of Women in
1973 to protest of the orga-
nization's efforts to distance
itself from gay and lesbian
groups.
Unfortunately, this legacy
of compartmentalizing iden-
tities to fight for a greater
good continues today. Just
yesterday, combative feminist
magazine Jezebel published
a story headlined "Let's find
Taylor Swift a black friend" -
missing the point entirely on
how to incorporate non-white
voices into the conversation
without tokenizing or simpli-
fying.
Despite controversy over
the word itself, there is a
universality to feminism that
when tapped into is immense-
ly empowering, as Adichie's
work demonstrates: there
are certain experiences that
women everywhere can relate
to, ways that women connect
across borders and demo-
graphics. But, conversely,
particularly because of social
media and "viral" feminism,
vocal American feminists can
often get caught in the privi-
leges of white, upper-class
feminism, tone deaf to other
identities - recent backlash
against Lena Dunham and
Taylor Swift proves this
trend.
Thankfully, perhaps
because of Twitter and our
increasingly global world,
or perhaps because of a con-
scious effort to be more inclu-
sive, other voices are coming
to life, adding more and more
narratives to the library of
pop culture feminism. Voices
like Adichie's, like Beyonce's,
like transgender activist and
star of "Orange is the New
Black" Laverne Cox. Hope-
fully this is part of a general
shift towards a less frac-
tured brand of feminism, a
global movement focused on
impact and education rather
than oversimplified declara-
tions. As Adichie personally
defines feminism, "A femi-
nist is a man or a woman who
says 'Yes, there is a problem
with gender as it is today.
And we must fix it. We must
do better."' We must.do bet-
ter, and feminism is only
stronger when it dissemi-
nates stories from a range of
voices. So watch Adichie's
videos. Read her books. Dis-
cover narratives distinct
from your own; it will only
serve to widen your perspec-
tive.

UMMA to present
'Over the Line'

Collaboration with
SMT&D showcases
saxophone talent
By KATHLEEN DAVIS
DailyArts Writer
There's an instrument that
transcends the line between clas-
sical and jazz,
old and new, fl th
that can elicit
deep passion Line
or a sooth-
ing backdrop UMMA
to a situa- Friday, Dec. 6
tion. It's been 1-4 p.m.
featured in Free
hit songs
in genres from blues to rock 'n'
roll, and it's been caricatured as
overly sensual by a shirtless Jon
Hamm in an SNL Digital Short.
I'm describing the saxophone,
the instrument that'll be featured
prominently in Saturday's instal-
lation concert "Over the Line," a
collaboration between the Uni-
versity's School of Music, Theatre
and Dance and the University of
MichiganMuseumofArt.
The sixth annual installation
concert highlights four student-
composed pieces, which will be
performed by SMTD students
in the galleries of UMMA. Each
piece was composed with both
the acoustic properties of the
saxophone and the artistic venue

in mind, to compliment the per-
formance space as well as to offer
the audience an interdisciplinary
museum experience.
Lisa Borgsdorf, Manager of
Public Programs at UMMA, is
excited about the opportunity for
music students to expand their
creative process outside the class-
roomin this showcase.
"We're giving students a space
to step outside the traditional
ways they might be working in a
studio practice, and instead work-
ing towards a public performance
in a museum setting, which is out-
side the norm for performances,"
Borgsdorf said.
Making the saxophone the
center of "Over the Line" was a
choice influenced by several fac-
tors. The installation concert
marks the 200th anniversary of
the invention of the saxophone, by
the eponymous Adolphe Sax, as
well as honoring the retirement of
Donald Sinta, Professor of Saxo-
phone in SMTD, who is one of the
world'stop classical performers of
the instrument as well as a much
loved University professor.
"Also, the saxophone just
sounds really awesome in the
museum spaces," Borgsdorf said
with a smile.
UMMA and SMTD have along-
standing collaboration, with the
most recent student performanc-
es developing out of UMMA's
2006-2009 renovations, which
consequently gave more space in

which to experiment with outside
collaborators.
"One of the strategies for how
we would enliven this new space
was to work in partnerships with
a number of different depart-
ments and organizations on cam-
pus to create programming for
the museum," Bergsdorf said.
This plan has been successful in
organizing unique performance
content in UMMA, like 'Over the
Line."'
"Over the Line" is unique in
several ways, one of the reasons
being that the installation concert
is one of the only performances
UMMA holds during museum
hours, rather than after closing
like most are. The structure of
"Over the Line" is also non-linear,
and audiences are urged to come
any time during the performance
and to explore the different gal-
leries and student performers in
whichever order they wish.
"This is just a completely dif-
ferent way to experience the gal-
leries," Borgsdorf said. "Being in
a gallery where the music is being
played in complete response to a
work of art changes the way you
interact with the art. (Over the
Line) opens up new possibilities
for how a person might connect
to the art, and it's pretty awesome
to celebrate the talents that these
students have, both the perform-
ers and the composers, and give
them a showcase to experiment
with."

How to judge an
actor's performance

A millennial's ode
to YouTube videos

By MAYANK MATHUR
DailyArts Writer
I've been a fan of awards
shows for as long as I can
remember. Even as a little kid I
enjoyed the self-congratulation
bonanzas an unreasonable
amount. To be fair, the only
awards shows I used to watch
as a kid were Bollywood ones
and let's face it - there's way
too much going on there for
people to focus on insignificant
things like actually handing
out awards for cinematic
achievement. There's an insane
amount of song and dance, just
the right amount of controversy
and an unhealthy number
of actors making painfully
awkward jokes during the
ceremony. Rewarding the
people involved in film seems
almost incidental to the entire
process.
It was only when I got older,
invested more time in film and,
most importantly, began to
watch movies from the West,
did I begin to appreciate award
shows for what they were ...
or what they could be. There's
something about Western
awards shows that oozes class.
It seems to me like everyone
cares about the pageantry
and everything is done in
earnest. I've wasted hours on
end on YouTube on the official
"Oscars" channel, looking up
clips from award ceremonies
through the years.
It was a lot of fun while it
lasted.
Despite the fun I used to
have while watching these
awards, I could never really

'M' rolling into rivalry game

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Wolverines face
Michigan natives

By ZACH SHAW
DailySports Writer
After starting the season with
a 2-5 record, Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson knew hi;
team needed to have a good
homestand to keep the season
alive.
Friday, Michigan has a chance
to make it a great one.
The Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten,
7-6 overall) look to continue
their hot streak in a single game
against Ohio State.
Michigan has won five of six at
home and takes on the Buckeyes
(1-1, 5-8-1) feeling good in all
areas ofthe game.
"Our team has got a lot of
confidence," Berenson said.
"There's still a level of humility,
though. We haven't won the
Stanley Cup or anything, but
we've got a lot of players who feel
betterabout themselves and their
game, and that's helpful."
The Wolverines' best asset
continues to be their offense.
After posting 19 goals in their
first seven games, the unit has
tallied 30 goals in its last six
games, vaulting itself to the No. 3
offense nationally.
Ohio State, however, returns
its goaltender tandem and eight
of nine defensemen from last
season, presenting Michigan
with its toughest challenge since
its slowstart.
"We've got to keep
challenging them in practice
and realize that every game's
going to be different," Berenson
said. "We're better now, but you
never know. The shots won't
always go in, so we've got to
make sure that we don't let up
any unearned or cheap goals on
the other end."
Coming to Ann Arbor having
split their last three series,
the team has struggled with
consistency for much of the
season, but Berenson knows his

Kyle Cooper grew up in the
shadow of the Big House, with
Desmond Howard and Charles
Woodson watching over him..
The Hillsdale College junior
forward is from Northville, some
20 miles northeast of Ann Arbor.
Posters of Michigan Stadium,
Howard's catch against Notre
Dame and Woodson plastered his
childhood bedroom's walls.
On Nov. 15, though, the
Michigan men's basketball team
was the opponent, and Cooper put
up a double-double, with a game-
high 28 points and 10 rebounds.
Hillsdale was overmatched,
though, as the Wolverines rolled
in their season opener, 92-65, but
Cooper's performance earned
him praise from Michigan coach
John Beilein after the game.
For Cooper, and a handful
of other local products, the
opportunity to play against a
teamthey watched and rooted for
growing up is one they'll cherish
for a longtime.
"When I first found out this
summer we were going to come
up (to Michigan) for a game
there was kind of that little bit of
nostalgia," Cooper said.
Hillsdale center Jason Pretzer,
a Jenison native, also noted how
special it was to play against
the Wolverines and how he has
watched Michigan's program
improve over the years.
"It was great watching them
just improve as I grew up,"
Pretzer said. "They're on a
completely different level now.
You expect them to make the
tournament every year - deep
runs."
On Nov. 17, the Wolverines
rolled past Bucknell and two

more Michigan natives.
Bucknell guard Chris Hass
grew up in Pellston, and forward
Cory Starkey is from Petoskey -
both about a 250-mile straight
shot north from Ann Arbor.
And when the Bison came
to town, Hass didn't go easy
against the team he used to
root for, shooting 7-of-14 from
the field and scoring a team-
high 21 points.
Three days after taking down
Bucknell, Michigan hosted
Detroit - a team that has just
four out-of-staters on its roster.
For one of the Titans, his
relationship to Michigan
basketball was passed through
lineage. Juwan Howard Jr. - son
of former Michigan star and Fab
Five member Juwan Howard -
is a redshirt junior forward for
Detroit and its leadingscorer.
Howard helped the Titans
keep it close for most of the night,
contributing a game-high 24
points in an eventual 71-62 loss.
"I look up to-my dad a lot,"
Howard said. "Seeing him have
success here, I wanted to do
the same thing and follow his
footsteps. But things didn't work
out. I think that was a learning
experience for me and gave me
an extra edge and a chip on my
shoulder."
For some who grew up nearby,
lining up across from Michigan
doesn't mean they'll stop rooting
for the Wolverines.
"It's nice playing a
team coming off a Big Ten
championship," Cooper said.
"Hell, I hope they win another
Big Ten championship, just to
give us some more credibility for
playing them tough."

WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
For DeLoof sisters, team is family

By KEVIN SANTO
Daily Sports Writer
When freshman swimmer
Gabby DeLoof arrived in Ann
Arbor this year, joining the
Michigan women's swimming
and diving team meant more
than finding a new family in
her teammates. Gabby was also
reunited with her older sister,
junior Ali DeLoof.
Competing together is more
of the same for the duo. The
sisters have swam together
most of their lives and were
teammates at Grosse Pointe
South (Michigan) High School.
They have been waiting to get
in the same pool again since Ali
graduated in 2012.
"It's very exciting," Ali said.
"(Our favorite part is) the
competition and acting goofy
sometimes. Some of the girls
call us the Goofy DeLoofies."
As if having two DeLoofs

weren't enough, Michigan
coach Mike Bottom revealed
Tuesday that Ali and Gabby's
thirdsister, Catie, will be joining
the 12th-ranked Wolverines
next fall. Catie DeLoof signed
her letter of intent Nov. 17. The
fourth DeLoof, Jacqueline,
currently competes at Grosse
Pointe South, and if she follows
in her sisters' footsteps, she
might don the maize and blue
soon, too.
"It's a great family," Bottom
said. "I expect thatthey're going
to get better, because that's
what the DeLoofs do. They're
just going to keep (improving),
hopefully all the way to the
international ranks."
The DeLoof-Michigan
tradition started as a result
of another family member
- cousin Alana Font, who
attended Michigan from 2008-
2012.
Font taught the sisters about

the Michigan athletic culture,
and they were fortunate to have
the opportunity to consistently
visit the campus together at
a young age. So, when they
received their recruiting letters
from Bottom, it was a dream
come true.
As members of such a
prestigious women's swimming
program, the DeLoofs have
learned to lean on each other
through the rigorous training
sessions and demanding
practice hours.
"My biggest obstacle would
be probably getting used to the
training and lifting," Gabby
said. "(I'm) overcoming that
(by) being positive, asking Ali
for advice. It's been a good
transition."
Ali DeLoof noted that her
transition was much different
than her sister's. Gabby knew
a majority of the team through
her sister prior to having a

recruiting trip.
Bottom was quick to sing Ali
and Gabby's praises for their
progress and success so far.
He emphasized that the sisters
are unique in their own right,
but that, as a package, they
are extremely coachable and a
pleasure to be around.
The coach commended Gabby
for her willingness to learn and
the enthusiasm she shows in
wanting to improve. In addition,
Bottom went on to pay tribute to
Ali's confidence, explaining that
she isn't intimidated by any of
her competition.
The DeLoof sisters are
currently competing in
the AT&T Winter National
Championships in Greensboro,
North Carolina, which started
Thursday.
As they have their entire
life, the duo is looking to blow
opponents out of the water,
together.
