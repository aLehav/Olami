Michigan 
gubernatorial 

candidate 
Abdul 
El-Sayed 

discussed his candidacy and 
platform to more than 150 
students 
and 
community 

members at the Ford School of 
Public Policy Monday night.

The event, hosted by the 

University of Michigan’s chapter 
of College Democrats, allowed 
students to ask questions and 
hear the story of the 32-year-
old University alum and Rhodes 
scholar.

As 
the 
son 
of 
Egyptian 

immigrants, El-Sayed recognized 
the unlikeliness of his candidacy. 
However, he stressed that his 
background of coming from a 
biracial family reflects the goals 
he has for Michigan to become 
more inclusive.

“This is the American family I 

grew up in,” El-Sayed said. “We 
didn’t always agree. The one 
thing we could agree upon was 
our future, that we could believe 
in this society regardless of 
background.”

Opposite to what some have 

said about his campaign, El-Sayed 
said his background and religious 
differences won’t hinder him, 
but will hopefully inspire a more 
diverse government.

“If you’re not going to vote 

for me because I’m Muslim, you 
weren’t going to vote for me 
anyway,” he said.

The idea of more diverse 

representation 
was 
reflected 

by LSA junior Ali Safawi, also a 
member of the Michigan Daily 
edit 
board, 
who 
introduced 

El-Sayed for the event.

“When you have a name like 

Ali, you get the feeling the politics 
isn’t for you, certainly less so than 
if your name was Bill or Craig,” 
Safawi said. “So I was very excited 
to hear that Dr. El-Sayed was 
running.”

El-Sayed 
also 
said 
his 

background as the former director 

of the Detroit Department of 
Health and Wellness Promotion 
will have a large impact on his 
candidacy, as it gave him a more 
intimate and open look into public 
health — an issue he intends to 
stress in his campaign. He said his 
unconventional background will 
help Michigan stray from “politics 
as usual,” which he believes is a 
mindset that hasn’t been working.

“It’s not just public health that 

suffers when you run government 

as a business,” he added. “It’s also 
things like public education.”

In an interview, El-Sayed 

said millennials will have a 
large impact on this campaign, 
much like the 2016 presidential 
campaign,

“Nobody has as large a stake 

in our future as students do,” 
El-Sayed said. “They have been 
very involved in my campaign and 
its message that we have to take 

A 
panel 
discussion 

addressing 
xenophobia 

under 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s administration was 
held 
Monday 
afternoon 
in 

the University of Michigan 
International 
Institute, 

where 
action 
against 

microaggressions and social 
threats were among the most 
highlighted topics.

The 
panel, 
which 
more 

than 50 students and faculty 
attended, opened with Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Councilmember 

Chuck Warpehoski (D–Ward 
5), director of the Interfaith 
Council 
for 
Peace 
and 

Justice, who led with a call 
to action against xenophobia 
not only in the rejection of 
visible hate crimes, but of 
microaggressions as well.

“I’ve seen the importance 

that these social affirmations 
of values can have for people 
who are under attack,” he said.

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
met on Monday afternoon to 
discuss the bathroom policy for 
transgender students it passed 
last week, hoping to expand 
the resolution. The board also 
welcomed Cynthia Wilbanks, 
the University of Michigan’s 
vice president of government 
relations, to discuss the Freedom 
of Information Act.

Last meeting, the board passed 

a bathroom policy that allows 
for members of the community 
to use the bathrooms they feel 
match their gender identity. 
SACUA derived its policy from 
the one in place at Oberlin 
College, but modified it slightly 
to include its own wording, while 
still capturing the essence of the 
other college’s policy. For this 
meeting, the members expanded 
their discussion to pinpoint more 
ways they could further provide 
for the LGBTQ community.

Nearly 160 graduate student 

employees 
rallied 
Monday 

afternoon in support of proposals 
to improve their contracts with 
the University of Michigan, which 
have hitherto been declined. 
Protesters began in the Diag 
before 
marching 
to 
Palmer 

Commons 
for 
the 
Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization’s 

biweekly bargaining session with 
the University.

The GEO — the union that 

represents 
graduate 
student 

instructors and graduate student 
staff assistants at the University — 
has been in the midst of contract 
negotiations 
since 
November. 

Their proposals were declined 
or not addressed sufficiently, 
according to GEO members.

GEO President John Ware, 

a physics Ph.D. student and 
research assistant, said the rally 
was organized in an effort to make 
visible the continued struggles 
graduate employees face.

“We’ve been at the table for 

four months now and we’ve just 
seen very little progress,” he 
said. “We’re still a long way from 
where we need to be, especially 
on some of the core issues that we 
really need to get us to equitable 
and 
inclusive 
employment 

for 
graduate 
employees. 
We 

think that’s really an integral 
component of an equitable and 
inclusive University.”

Ware 
noted 
the 
small 

bargaining 
team 
represents 

universal concerns.

“The point we’re trying to 

make out here is that it’s not just 
the six dedicated volunteers that 
sit at the bargaining table, that 
these are issues that come from 
the University community,” Ware 
said. “They are widely felt and 
people care about them and we’re 
all watching.”

One of the central proposals 

is to increase graduate employee 
pay, because the cost of living in 
Ann Arbor is higher than most 
other Michigan cities and the 
housing market for students is 
very competitive.

percent 
won’t

Program to cover fake news, authoritarianism and Affordable Care Act in current climate

The introduction of a Teach-Out 

Series on topics ranging from “fake 
news” to the rise of increasingly 
authoritarian 
governments 
was 

announced 
by 
University 
of 

Michigan President Mark Schlissel 
at an Innovation Forum hosted by 
the University’s Office of Academic 
Innovation 
on 
Monday 
night. 

There are four “global community 
learning” events scheduled so far 
in the series to be hosted on the 
edX platform — a digital education 
company which aims to improve 
education research at universities 
worldwide.

The event was also a continuation 

of Schlissel’s Academic Innovation 
Initiative, which launched in fall 
2016 in an effort to foster growth in 
technology use to further classroom 
learning.

At the beginning of the event, 

Schlissel said he was excited 
the University is hosting these 

teach-outs, which are modeled 
after the teach-ins that began at 
the University starting in 1965 to 
protest then-President Lyndon B. 
Johnson’s military escalation in the 
Vietnam War.

The 
four 
course 
offerings 

available through the edX platform 
will cover: the transition from 
democratic to authoritarian rule, 
fake 
news, 
communication 
of 

scientific research, and the future 
of the Affordable Care Act, former 
President Barack Obama’s health 
care law. These topics were selected 
because of their relevance to 

modern-day global politics — much 
like the inspiration for the teach-ins 
held at the University over 50 years 
ago.

“Tonight’s event is keeping with 

the University’s historic ideals as 
we move forward into its third 
century,” Schlissel said at the event 
to an audience of over 100 attendees.

However, unlike the teach-ins 

of the 1960s, which were in-person 
lectures 
given 
in 
university 

classrooms, the online teach-outs,

Students and faculty discussed 

ways to manage the nation’s 
energy requirement and protect 
the 
rights 
of 
both 
Native 

Americans and the environment 
during 
a 
town 
hall 
hosted 

Tuesday evening by LSA Student 
Government. 
The 
town 
hall 

was sprouted out of the national 
controversy 
surrounding 
the 

Dakota Access Pipeline.

About 35 people met in the 

Michigan League to listen to four 
panelists: Mark Barteau, director 
of the University of Michigan 
Energy Institute, Philip Deloria, 
professor of history and American 
culture, who is an expert of 
Native American studies, LSA 
senior Jayson Toweh, president 

of Students for Clean Energy and 
Adam Simon, associate professor 
of Earth and Environmental 
Sciences.

LSA sophomores Sophia Leon 

and Connor Kippe — respective 
chair and vice chair of the sub-
committee of LSA SG called 
Taking Responsibility for the 
Earth and Environment — began 
planning the event shortly after 
the 2016 presidential election.

The 
pipeline’s 
proposed 

route crosses under a lake 
near the Standing Rock Sioux 
Reservation in North Dakota. 
Thousands of demonstrators 
from 
across 
the 
country 

spent months camping on 
the 
reservation 
in 
protest 

of the damage that could be 
done by the pipeline to the 
Sioux Tribe’s water sources. 
In December, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers announced 
the 1,172-mile pipeline would 
be rerouted, but President 
Donald Trump reversed the 
decision with an executive 
action on Jan. 24, ordering 
construction to continue.

“We decided to organize 

(the event) quite a while ago,” 
Kippe said. “It’s taken a while 
to get all of the professors 
together, 
but 
we 
started 

planning the event back when 
it was still really contentious 
and in was up in the air a lot, 
now it’s a little bit more subtle.”

Leon 
stated 
changing 

policies and administrations 
resulted in some challenges 
planning the event.

“It’s interesting, because 

we’ve seen a lot of changes 
while planning the event in 
terms of the administration 
and 
what 
actions 
they’ve 

taken,” Leon said. “We just 
hope people get a balanced 
view and the different facets of 
the problem.”

The University of Michigan’s 

School of Information has 

achieved a Platinum-level 

certification for sustainability 

from the Office of Campus 

Sustainability.

All three UMSI locations 

earned the platinum certification 

—the highest certification 

offered— and is the first 

school within the University of 

Michigan to do so.

UMSI’s locations in North 

Quad, Maynard Street and North 

University Avenue achieved 

Silvers status in 2014 and Gold 

status in 2015. These locations 

are among the 165 certified 

Sustainable Workplaces on 

campus.

“Earning this certification 

was truly an all-school effort, led 

by a dedicated and determined 

team of staff members who 

worked with imagination and 

commitment to improve our 

Planet Blue status, year by year,” 

said UMSI Dean Thomas Finholt, 

according to the University 

Record.

The standards set by the 

Office of Campus Sustainability 

in 2012 provide departments 

with steps to certification, 

including recommendations 

on sustainable practices and 

methods for identifying potential 

issues.

UMSI trained all its new 

employees with the Planet 

Blue Ambassador program, 

which made 85 percent of its 

staff certified Planet Blue 

Ambassadors and earned them 

the Platinum-level certification. 

Planet Blue represents the 

University’s commitment to 

becoming even more sustainable 

by 2025. 

Additional UMSI 

initiatives contributed to their 

Platinum rating, including 

increasing reusable mug usage, 

programming printers to print 

double-sided, purchasing 

rechargeable batteries, enabling 

sleep mode on computers and 

printers and installing timers on 

hallway lights.

the rent,” rally-goers chanted, 
in reference to the insufficient 
2 percent wage increase the 
University offered.

Ware 
explained 
graduate 

student 
employees 
are 
paid 

approximately 18 percent below 
the living wage in Ann Arbor, 
according to the MIT Living Wage 
Calculator. 

GEO Communications Co-chair 

Sara Chadwick, a psychology and 
women’s studies Ph.D. student, said 
the rally allows graduate students 
to stand in solidarity despite the 
inadequate response from the 
University.

“The fact that the University has 

the rejected all of (the) proposals, 
we view as problematic and 
disappointing and so we want 
to have a big sign of solidarity 
amongst all of us in order to show 
the University that we are paying 
attention to these things,” she said.

Chadwick said there is an 

ongoing Facebook feed where 
graduate student employees are 
expressing 
their 
appreciation 

for the health care they receive. 

She said among other topics of 
interest, they want to make sure 
their premiums stay free and that 
families can afford health care 
for their dependents. The GEO 
is also concerned with obtaining 
more adequate parental leave and 
childcare benefits.

Chadwick said another area of 

interest addressed in the proposals 
concerns mental health services for 
graduate students, seeing as this 
population experiences high rates 
of depression and anxiety.

Jimmy Brancho, a chemistry 

Ph.D. student, gets mental health 
benefits through the contracted 
negotiated by GEO. He said he goes 
to a therapist for general counseling 
and it costs him 25 to 50 dollars 
each week out of pocket. He said in 
times he requires more services, it 
costs more and changes how he has 
to plan for the month.

“I would like to work in a place 

where I don’t have to make choices 
between if I’m going to stock my 
fridge with food or if I’m going to 
be able to talk to my therapist,” he 
said.

He said the current health 

insurance plan is insufficient.

“The way the current health 

insurance is set up is you’re given 
a maximum of, it might be six 

sessions, before your therapist has 
to ask the health care people to give 
you more sessions,” he said. “They 
normally do that, but if they didn’t 
we would be screwed and we’d 
have to pay fifty dollars per session 
out of pocket. There is no language 
to protect us from that sort of thing, 
as I understand it.”

The proposals are asking for 

monetary benefits with regard to 
this service.

Also among the proposals is 

one to protect graduate student 
working hours. Certain visas do 
not allow international students 
to work more than 20 hours per 
week. However, the University’s 
current contract holds that GSIs 
can be required to work more than 
20 hours.

The issue became particularly 

relevant when President Donald 
Trump released the executive 
order 
to 
restrict 
immigration 

from 
seven 
Muslim-majority 

countries in late January. The most 
recent 
immigration 
legislation 

from Trump, however, has made 
changes to the initial order.

academic innovation, hope to reach 
a global audience.

“The University of Michigan 

Teach-Out Series can be a model for 
a new era of engagement between 
institutions of higher education and 
the global communities they serve,” 
Hilton said. “Part of our public 
mission is to create opportunities 
for citizens to be informed, because 
the more informed people are, the 
more informed debate can be.”

Education 
master’s 
student 

Bayane Alem said prior to the event 
she was eager to hear elaboration 
of how the University plans to 
approach new methods of teaching.

“I know this is a conversation 

about how we can learn from the 
University in different ways, I guess 
just to see how the University is 
thinking about students and how 
they’re thinking about approaching 
learning in new ways and if that’s 
actually going to result in practical 
different ways of teaching at the 
University level,” she said. 

Natural Resources Prof. Arun 

Agrawal will host the first of the 
teach-out events on authoritarian 

rule. He also told the Daily before 
the event he is looking forward to 
having the opportunity to teach 
about 
topics 
of 
contemporary 

importance to a wide audience 
online.

“We look forward to engaging 

online learners in this teach-out,” 
Agrawal stated in a press release. 
“Our historical and comparative 
lens will inform how societies and 
citizens have responded to the 
back and forth of more democratic 
versus more authoritarian political 
structures. The almost-daily churn 
of the current political climate 
makes our just-in-time approach to 
the learning experience ever more 
relevant.”

The event began with a keynote 

address given by edX CEO Anant 
Agarwal, who spoke about the 
need to expand online academic 
programs to meet the needs 
of students worldwide and the 
changing dynamics of the labor 
market.

“Because the world around 

us is changing, the demands of 
education 
must 
also 
change,” 

Agarwal said. “We founded edX 
to address these challenges. Our 
mission is to reimagine education 
for the 21st century and to meet the 

needs of those seeking continuous 
education for career advancement.”

The University’s relationship 

with edX goes back to October 
2015, when the University became a 
charter member of the educational 
non-profit 
organization. 
Last 

September, 
the 
University 

expanded its partnership with the 
addition of three MicroMasters 
programs, which are graduate-level 
courses that are available to those 
seeking career advancement.

In October 2016, the University 

announced a partnership with both 
edX and Microsoft to improve K-12 
teaching methods.

Agarwal said online platforms 

allow for more flexible learning 
opportunities 
among 
students, 

and they have received positive 
feedback from students who have 
piloted these opportunities.

“The reviews from the students 

are 
absolutely 
amazing, 
they 

absolutely love it,” he said. “Students 
are finding that the stress levels are 
lower by being able to flexibly watch 
videos and flexibly do things, the 
stress is lower. And undergraduate 
stress is a big issue. Any number of 
reasons where we can use digital 
technology to transform our reach 
both on campus and online.”

Following Agarwal’s keynote 

address, School of Information 
Prof. Barry Fishman, the head 
of the OAI Digital Innovation 
Greenhouse 
learning 
platform, 

GradeCraft, introduced a panel 
of University administrators and 
professors. In his opening speech 
to the audience, Fishman touted the 
universal appeal of the Teach-Out 
Series.

“The teach-out does resonate 

with students and faculty because 
the University should be a place to 
both inform and connect,” Fishman 
said.

Included in the panel was: 

Kedra Ishop, the vice provost 
for enrollment management and 
the executive vice president for 
academic affairs at the Office of the 
Provost, Engineering Prof. Joanna 
Millunchick, Agrawal and School 
of Information Dean, Thomas 
Finholt.

The topic of the panel discussion 

focused on the use of massive online 
open courses — courses taught by 
University faculty that are offered 
online and available to the general 
public.

According to Ishop, the potential 

of MOOCs to expand access to 
the University is a promising 

opportunity, because it enables the 
institution to reach students both 
before they are college-age and 
after graduation.

“It’s the question of how you 

innovate and maintain access (to 
the University),” Ishop said. “The 
space of K-12 transiting to higher 
education, how do you make sure 
that as we identify some of these 
areas, as we identify ways to 
supplement we make sure it has 
breadth, that it’s attainable.”

Ishop 
highlighted 
already-

existing University initiatives, like 
Wolverine Pathways, a program 
designed to mentor middle and 
high schoolers from underfunded 
public schools in Detroit, Southfield 
and Ypsilanti before they apply 
to the University. She said by 
expanding access to MOOCs for 
that demographic, the University 
can potentially boost institutional 
diversity by targeting students who 
are still enrolled pre-collegiate 
schools.

The topic of the panel then 

shifted from the wider potential of 
MOOCs to the specifics about the 
Teach-Out Series events. Agrawal 
said the public availability of the 
teach-outs is a positive example 
of the potential for MOOCs to 

be used as a way for educational 
institutions to connect with the 
public on contemporary issues in a 
manner similar to the Teach-Ins of 
the 1960s.

“It’s not only about making 

factual 
things 
more 
quickly 

possible, it’s also about reimagining 
the nature of learning at the 
University, which we need to do,” 
he said. “We need to free ourselves 
from teaching facts and make 
places where students react and 
reflect and become different, better, 
more capable students.”

Business and Education master’s 

student Iris Nguyen said after the 
event she felt the forum brought up 
issues she found pressing to future 
educators that are not necessarily 
discussed in other spaces.

“I think it addressed a lot of 

the issues education faces with 
developing, I hate the phrase, but 
21st-century learners equipped to 
go out into society and deal with our 
biggest issues today,” she said. “So 
I feel like it’s a conversation that’s 
not necessarily always taking place 
in classrooms, so having a space to 
hear what’s happening on that front 
and what they’re thinking about 
and innovating in that space was 
really inspiring.”

and Remedies” — alluded to 
current tensions in both the 
local and national political 
climate. 
With 
the 
recent 

spike in hate crimes following 
Trump’s 
election, 
many 

audience members expressed 
their desire to take a stand 
against 
xenophobia 
and 

inquired for ways to become 
activists.

History 
Prof. 
Anne 

Berg followed with a brief 
presentation 
outlining 
the 

approaches the Nazi regime 
in Germany used to mark 
“deviants,” 
specifically 

those 
of 
African 
descent, 

differently-abled individuals 
and Jewish people. She also 
affirmed these same tropes 

are rampant in society today, 
with the fear that “others” in 
society are somehow a threat 
to the system and an “us.” 

“Usually 
it’s 
that 
the 

inferiors are both painted 
as dramatically weak and 
at the same time extremely 
dangerous,” she said. “They’re 
accused of being a burden on 
the system. In that respect, 
not much has changed.”

Following 
Berg’s 

presentation, 
Sociology 

Prof. 
Fatma 
Müge 
Göçek 

explored 
societal 
violence, 

both in the United States 
and 
her 
home 
country, 

Turkey. She highlighted the 
importance of acknowledging 
structural 
violence 
in 
an 

effort 
to 
delegitimize 
it, 

citing examples from sexual 
assault on college campuses 
to torture at the Guantanamo 

Bay prison.

“One 
problem 
with 
the 

American approach is that 
we always see this violence 
occurring 
everywhere 
else 

and 
we 
do 
not 
actually 

acknowledge 
the 
violence 

occurring in our own society,” 
she said.

She went on to outline the 

distinctions between white 
guilt 
versus 
responsibility, 

claiming that white Americans 
need to take moral and ethical 
responsibility for the past and 
actively work to make things 
better, rather than simply feel 
guilty. She concluded on a 
positive note, adding she has 
great faith in millennials for 
upholding values of inclusivity 
for the future.

She 
was 
followed 
by 

Political Science Prof. Vince 
Hutchings, 
who 
provided 

another 
perspective 
with 

his 
extensive 
background 

in U.S. domestic policy. He 
stressed 
the 
racial 
divide 

in politics has provided an 
incentive for politicians to 
use racial priming in an effort 
to pull in voters and satisfy 
constituents. He vocalized his 
disapproval of these tactics 
by 
both 
the 
Democratic 

and Republican Parties and 
expressed his hope for a less 
divided political climate for 
the future.

LSA 
senior 
Christine 

Liu 
later 
expressed 
her 

satisfaction with the panel.

“I thought it was a good 

explanation of what may need 
to happen to rectify the onset 
of xenophobia that has been 
more 
outwardly 
expressed 

with 
this 
recent 
election 

cycle,” she said.

expansion of it.

“Suppose 
I 
were 
to 
say 

bathroom were a metaphor for all 
facilities, showers, sports,” Ortega 
said. “If the idea is to create a safe 
space, why are we limiting it to the 
bathroom?”

Another 
SACUA 
member 

Michael Atzmon, professor of 
engineering, 
added 
his 
own 

concerns over the bathroom policy, 
worrying people in the University 
of Michigan community were not 
educated on transgender rights. 

“I’m 
not 
sure 
people 
are 

sufficiently educated about these 
issues,” he said. “Just go on the 
internet and see what’s being said 
about this.”

Further concerns were voiced 

from SACUA Chair Bill Schultz, 

an 
engineering 
professor, 

who 
worried 
non-transgender 

individuals would take advantage 
of 
the 
bathroom 
policy 
for 

“shenanigans.” After the meeting, 
in an interview, Schultz described 
how the decision to modify the 
resolution from last week was 
reached.

“We passed it sort of on the 

fly last week and we didn’t pass 
it as much as approve it to be put 
forward to the Senate Assembly 
one 
week 
from 
today,” 
he 

explained, saying that it was not 
yet an official rule that has been 
instated on campus. 

Schultz also added there was 

no external pressure from any 
community 
to 
bring 
forward 

this policy — SACUA decided to 
bring up the issue on its own.

back our future.”

In order to mobilize millennials, 

El-Sayed said more investments 
need to be made into economies 
like Detroit’s in order to keep 
millennials 
in 
Michigan. 

Additionally, 
he 
mentioned 

sustaining the political activism 
seen by young voters will be 
difficult — but necessary — to 
the goals of his campaign. LSA 
sophomore Lauren Schandevel, 
public relations chair of College 
Democrats and a columnist for the 
Daily, said College Democrats will 
continue to encourage students 
to become involved with the 
gubernatorial race.

“We love being a platform for 

students who are a huge part of the 
grassroots movement,” Shandevel 
said.

Additionally, El-Sayed said Ann 

Arbor will be important to this 

campaign, considering its history 
of producing “people-first policy.” 
Despite the potential importance 
of millennials, like University 
students, in this race, El-Sayed said 
students need to recognize their 
privilege if any empathetic work is 
to be done.

“The 
economy 
is 
largely 

subsidized 
by 
people 
who 

often don’t have access to our 
institutions,” El-Sayed said. “We 
need to translate economic well-
being into helping the lives of 
people who aren’t as privileged.”

Schandevel said it was his 

promotion of empathy that was 
most strikingly different from 
other candidates.

“When he dealt with the 

question of crime, saying it was a 
symptom of poverty was unlike 
remarks I’ve heard from other 
politicians,” Schandevel said. “He 
was so willing to empathize, so 
willing to really pick at problem. 
That’s something recent politicians 
have really been lacking.”

In regards to President Donald 

Trump’s administration, El-Sayed 
stressed that a divisive political 
climate is not conducive to good 
policy. He said students can start 
unifying conversations by offering 
to listen to conservative voters.

“I have family who voted for 

Trump and they weren’t people 
who were hateful or xenophobic,” 
El-Sayed said. “Their interests may 
not align with us, but if we see a 
person, we can see across an aisle.”

Though El-Sayed recognized 

his identity as a cisgender, straight 
man, he said his ethnic and 
religious background has made 
him more sensitive to issues of 
those of all identities, including 
women’s rights and transgender 
people’s rights. He maintained his 
campaign will be different from 
those of other politicians who 
identify similarly.

“We 
have 
to 
believe 
that 

government is for the people by the 
people and that it hasn’t been sold 
out to corporations or to money,” 
El-Sayed said. “I’m not running for 
governor to be governor.”

O

ver 
Spring 
Break, 
I 

had 
an 
Uber 
driver 

ask me, completely out 

of 
nowhere, 
“How 

long was your past 
relationship?” 
I 

remember 
thinking 

to myself, “Why is he 
asking me this? He 
has no right to know.” 
As a white female 
college student who 
was clearly out of her 
element in southern 
Florida, he probably 
saw me as an easy 
target. While I found 
it very creepy, I responded with 
something that I knew would end 
the conversation: “Three years.” 
And the fact is, I have never been 
in 
a 
romantic 
“relationship,” 

but then again, what defines a 
“relationship” anyway? 

I have had many relationships 

— none that have been socially 
constructed as “romantic” — 
but relationships nonetheless. 
I have had relationships with 
friends that have taught me a 
lot about myself and have had 
relationships with teachers that 
have benefited me immensely 
as a learner. I have had a strong 
relationship with my mom all 
my life and had an amazing 
relationship 
with 
my 
math 

tutor that I would not change 
for anything. Until college, I 
did not really think much about 
relationships; I have not been in 
a socially constructed boyfriend-
girlfriend relationship and am 
perfectly OK with that.

“How long was your past 

relationship?” I said to the driver, 
surprising my friends in the 
back seat with my pursuit of the 
conversation. He replied, “You 
don’t need to know that.” When 
I asked why, he said, “Because 
you’re a girl; girls have vagina 
power that men will never have.”

At this point, I was fuming. 

Sitting in this Uber, I thought 
about 
why 
on 
earth 
my 

driver would ask me such a 
meaningless question. I couldn’t 
help but think of the labels 
young women innately have just 
by being women. In the women’s 
studies classes I have enrolled in 

since attending the University of 
Michigan, I have learned about 
the 
stigmatizing 
stereotypes 

women 
face 
in 

society 
and 
how 

some 
individuals 

cannot see beyond 
the binary. Not only 
had my Uber driver 
asked 
me 
about 

something that was 
strictly 
dependent 

on my gender, he 
came to conclusions 
that 
ignored 
the 

obstacles 
women 

have 
to 
overcome 

constantly in society. 

It took every fiber of my 

being to not go on a 20-minute 
rant about socially-constructed 
gender roles. I calmed myself 
down and realized that as much 
as I wanted to change this man’s 
beliefs, there was no way that 
would happen in the 10-minute 
car ride back to the hotel. 

It takes a lot of mental 

strength to choose your battles 
and move on. As sad as it is, it is 
not often that you get into a deep 
conversation with a stranger 
that results in changing their 
beliefs about an issue you 
feel to be morally important. 
Everyone is different, and our 
experiences 
throughout 
life 

shape the way we think and live 
within our communities.

This Uber driver’s lifestyle 

was likely vastly different from 
my own, and though I did not 
appreciate the way he talked to 
me, he made a point to relay that 
he was mildly joking. However, 
in every joke there is some truth. 
Though I did not feel threatened, 
it saddened me that he thought 
about women this way.

In 1848, the women’s suffrage 

movement began at the Seneca 
Falls Convention. It was more 
than 50 years later that women 
got the right to vote in 1920. A 
right that female youth in the 21st 
century often take for granted 
took more than half a lifetime 
to implement. In 1963, the Equal 
Pay Act was passed, but we still 
have a wage gap. In 1965, the 
Weeks v. Southern Bell case 
fought against restrictive labor 

laws for women, but women are 
still not treated equally in the 
workforce. In 1973, Roe v. Wade 
granted women the right to 
be educated on contraceptives 
and 
obtain 
legal 
abortions, 

but policymakers still try to 
restrict women’s control over 
their bodies. And in 2013, the 
ban against women in military 
combat positions was removed, 
finally reducing restrictions on 
women wanting to sacrifice their 
lives to serve our country, but 
they are still objectified by their 
male counterparts. 

Our history as women has 

been strong. We have come a 
long way to make waves in an 
oppressive society, but we can’t 
stop fighting and must always be 
aware of how we can help enact 
this change.

Transforming the ways our 

society views women has not 
and is not going to happen 
overnight. Instances like the 
one with that Uber driver in 
Miami frustrate me and show 
me that some people still don’t 
know the meaning of feminism 
and the true progress that 
women have made.

As I got out of the car that 

night in Miami, my final words 
were “Thanks for the ride, but 
you should look up a definition of 
feminism and educate yourself.” 
Unsure of what his response 
was, I felt reassured knowing 
that I at least tried. Did he look 
up the definition? Probably not. 
But at least I knew that I made 
a conscious effort to plant the 
seed in his mind on something 
that needs to be reinforced in 
our society.

In an age when women are 

holding marches to support 
unity and educating others on 
ground-breaking reconstruction 
of gender norms, there are many 
small acts we can perform to 
help make this change. I have 
come to terms with the fact that 
I can’t change everyone’s beliefs, 
and in order to make a significant 
difference, it is the small stuff 
that really counts.

W

elcome to the post-
Spring-Break log-jam 
of large assignments 

and late midterm exams. I was 
lucky enough not to be 
saddled with the latter. 
Of course, I didn’t want 
to work on that project 
assigned two weeks 
ago, but lo and behold, 
I have arrived at the 
panic zone of three 
days before the due 
date without having 
done any of the work. 
I, of course, rushed to 
finish the project that 
I was certain I would 
do well on, only to receive a grade 
reflective of my effort.

This 
is 
a 
common 

procrastinator’s 
problem, 

brought 
on 
by 
the 
end-of-

the-year 
fatigue 
and 
an 

overwhelming desire to fast-
forward to summer, when some 
of us will pursue professional 
development, employment and 
educational opportunities, and 
not focus on schoolwork as 
much. While March may be a 
difficult time to find motivation 
to put one’s best effort into 
academic work, hopefully this 
column can help my fellow 
procrastinators find value in 
starting 
projects 
and 
exam 

preparations early.

No matter what your class 

standing is, using this time as 
an opportunity to either create 
momentum for next year or 
cap off a good academic record 
upon 
graduation 
will 
yield 

tremendous rewards (the very 
least of which is a solidified 
work ethic).

What 
do 
we 
lose 
when 

we 
allow 
ourselves 
to 

procrastinate? 
We 
lose 
the 

ability to get ahead on projects 
and develop relationships with 
others, but, most importantly, 
we lose the opportunity to 
develop ourselves and grow 
personal discipline that will 
serve us throughout life. We 
lose the chance to practice and 

refine our skill set. A gifted 
pianist who procrastinates his 
practice may find himself falling 
behind his peers. Moreover, 

the 
institution 
of 

personal 
discipline 

helps us all become 
better at what we do, 
be it writing, singing 
or playing basketball. 

A 
graduating 

senior may have the 
impression that he or 
she has little to gain 
from putting effort 
into his or her final 
semester. You already 
secured your dream 

job or internship? You’re not 
worried about your GPA dropping 
because you already secured a 
spot in graduate school? Surely, a 
healthy dosage of senioritis is due, 
right? Wrong. A slip-up in attitude 
and academic performance could 
bring significant consequences. 

If your employer sees that your 

effort dropped after accepting a 
job offer, it may tell them that you 
focus only on short-term goals 
and don’t think about trying to 
achieve 
long-term 
objectives. 

They may anticipate that once 
you get a promotion you want, 
you may decide to stop putting 
effort into tasks and could lose 
your desire to be an effective 
employee. Why would they want 
to hire someone who is only in it 
for themselves and is not invested 
in 
long-term 
projects? 
They 

wouldn’t. According to Forbes 
Reporter Susan Adams, GPA 
matters quite a bit to employers, 
because “it’s really one of the only 
indications 
(employers) 
have 

of a student’s technical ability 
or competence to do the job.” 
So not only do grades indicate 
attitude and work ethic, they 
also demonstrate competence, 
something 
essential 
in 
the 

current job market.

So how does one maintain 

the motivation to continue to 
demonstrate 
this 
competence 

and zeal to complete projects 
successfully in the latter half of one’s 

senior year? College admissions 
counselor Kat Cohen has a few 
recommendations, 
the 
most 

important of which being taking the 
time to relax and recharge.

Yes, 
you 
have 
achieved 

something 
spectacular 
that 

required a great deal of effort, 
preparation 
and 
sleepless 

nights spent preparing resumes 
and cover letters or studying 
course material. You deserve 
to relax. But instead of letting 
this 
become 
permission 
to 

turn on auto-pilot, use it as an 
opportunity to prepare for the 
next chapter, which begins 
now. How can you use the 
remaining time in the year to 
build your organizational skills 
so you are successful at your 
internship or job? How can 
you take full advantage of the 
opportunity to end the year on 
a high note, whether that means 
giving more of yourself to your 
extracurricular 
activities 
or 

challenging yourself to learn 
a new skill in your classes that 
may prove useful going forward?

Letting 
success 
get 
to 

your head will prohibit your 
personal growth by keeping 
you focused on staying in 
the same place, instead of 
finding ways to innovatively 
move forward. Complacency 
consequently grows out of this 
self-satisfaction. Former Intel 
CEO Andrew Grove once said, 
“Success breeds complacency. 
Complacency breeds failure. 
Only the paranoid survive.” So 
when you find success, after 
briefly re-charging, take the 
chance to ask yourself, “Now 
what? Where can I go from 
here? How can I add value and 
challenge 
myself?” 
Because 

the time we have to make 
productive 
contributions 
to 

society is inherently limited, 
we mustn’t lose time during the 
Ides of March being idle.

P

resident 
Donald 

Trump’s first month in 
office came to an end 

recently, and the world of 
environmental policy is still 
reeling from the dramatic and 
counterproductive 
changes 

Trump’s 
administration 
has 

made. The futures of critical 
Obama-era 
legislation 
and 

agencies, which were designed 
to 
protect 
ecosystems 
and 

foster 
sustainable 
industry 

practices amid the realities of 
climate change, now appear 
threatened by the potential 
of executive orders aimed at 
dismantling them. 

One of the most troubling 

changes has been Scott Pruitt’s 
confirmation as head of the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency on Feb. 17. Pruitt has been 
a longtime adversary of the EPA, 
having sued the agency 14 times 
for its efforts to regulate mercury, 
smog and carbon emissions from 
power plants. But his history 
of opposition to environmental 
regulation extends beyond the 
EPA: Pruitt has also developed 
long-standing 
ties 
with 
the 

fossil fuel industry. During his 
time as the attorney general 
of 
Oklahoma, 
for 
example, 

he dismantled a specialized 
environmental protection unit 
and established a “federalism 
unit” to counter what he referred 
to as “unwarranted regulation 
and 
systemic 
overreach 
(by 

federal agencies).” 

This 
aggressive 
approach 

secured him the approval of 
many Republicans and the oil 
and gas industries. Pruitt has 
made numerous claims that he is 
determined to eliminate the Clean 
Power Plan, a critical climate 
policy created under the Obama 
administration that aims to reduce 
carbon emissions in order to 
combat climate change. However, 
Pruitt’s continuous skepticism of 
climate change data, evident in 
his efforts to defend these interest 
groups, 
has 
highlighted 
his 

willingness to compromise public 
and environmental health in order 
to further support the fossil fuel 
industry, leaving even more room 
for further dismantlement of key 
climate change regulations.

To 
make 
matters 
worse, 

Trump has proposed substantial 
cuts to the EPA’s budget, resulting 
in the elimination of dozens of 
core programs and reducing the 
agency’s staff by 20 percent in the 
first year alone. Additionally, the 
cuts would shrink grants to states 
— including those for air and 
water programs — by 30 percent.

For 
example, 
restoration 

efforts 
in 
the 
Great 
Lakes 

are 
expected 
to 
experience 

a jolting stop, as the Great 
Lakes 
Restoration 
Initiative 

budget is facing a potential 97 
percent cut. Jeffrey Reutter, a 
special adviser of the Sea Grant 
College Program at Ohio State 
University, voiced the fears of 
many environmentalists on how 
“we’ve seen (Lake Erie) go from 
the poster child for pollution 
problems to the best example in 
the world of ecosystem recovery. 
Now it’s headed back again.” 

Other restoration efforts in the 

Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound and 
the Gulf of Mexico are also at risk 
of facing major cuts. Moreover, 
Trump signed a repeal of the 
transparency rule, a regulation 
that required energy companies 
to 
disclose 
their 
payments 

to foreign governments. The 
repeal of this rule reduces the 
accountability of the fossil fuel 
industry. In response to this 
decision, Sen. Sherrod Brown 
(D–Ohio) 
said, 
“this 
kind 

of 
transparency 
is 
essential 

to 
combating 
waste, 
fraud, 

corruption and mismanagement.”

The president continued to 

act on his skepticism of climate 
change by signing a bill on Feb. 
16 that ended Obama’s coal-

mining regulation, which was 
implemented in order to protect 
waterways from coal mining 
waste and maintain public health. 
With coal being the largest source 
of carbon emissions and a major 
contributor to global warming, 
the reversal of this regulation 
could 
result 
in 
immense, 

immediate and long-term water, 
ecosystem and climate damage.

Moreover, despite months 

of 
protests 
and 
public 

outcry, on Jan. 24, Trump 
signed executive orders that 
authorized the continuation 
of the construction of the 
Dakota Access Pipeline and 
Keystone XL Pipeline. Today, 
the 
construction 
of 
DAPL 

is nearly complete. Not only 
does the pipeline encroach on 
sacred indigenous land of the 
Sioux Tribe, it also threatens 
the ecological quality of the 
land itself. The Standing Rock 
and 
Cheyenne 
River 
Sioux 

Tribes have now filed a lawsuit 
against the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers with the hopes of 
ending the pipeline’s drilling. 
The lawsuit details how, in 
the event of an oil spill or any 
damage to the lake, the water 
supply and quality surrounding 
the land could be compromised, 
thus posing an enormous threat 
to the food supply.

Last month alone was a 

trying time for advocates of 
environmental 
stewardship, 

and we now await updates 
regarding the future of the 
Clean Power Plan, the EPA and 
climate regulation. However, 
campaigns and organizations 
founded to support scientific 
research and data, including 
the March for Science, are 
now 
even 
stronger. 
The 

continuous growth of these 
movements will require united 
and steadfast support in the 
face of such opposition in 
order to continue fighting for 
the implementation of strong 
and effective environmental 
regulations.

Jung Yun, writer and assistant 

professor of English at George 
Washington University, will be at 
Literati Bookstore on Wednesday 
to celebrate the paperback release 
of her first novel “Shelter.” 

Yun began writing the first 

scene of her debut novel in 2004. 
After 12 years, “Shelter” was finally 
published in 2016 and is now being 
released as a paperback book. 
Yun studied at Vassar College, the 
University of Pennsylvania and 
the University of Massachusetts 
at Amherst, where she received 
her M.F.A. in Creative Writing. In 
graduate school, she wrote many 
short stories, and “Shelter” is her 
first to recieve wide acclaim.

In an email interview, Yun said 

she starts with the image.

“That tends to be my writing 

process — image first, storyline 
later,” Yun wrote. “Sometimes it 
takes a while to understand what 
the story is and how the image 
connects, so I often tell people that 
it took ten years to complete the 
novel if I include all the thinking 
time, or 3.5 years if I only include 
the research and writing time.”

“Shelter” follows Kyung Cho, 

a young father who is burdened 
by a life he cannot afford. A few 
miles away, his parents, Jin and 
Mae, live in the most exclusive 
neighborhood in the town. They 
are surrounded by material things 
that Kyung wishes he could have 
for his own family. 

The plot describes Kyung’s 

uncomfortable childhood, his own 
parents affluent, but extremely 
unkind in nature. Later, Kyung 
refuses to see them, or even ask 
them for help when he needs 
it most. However, when an act 
of violence leaves Jin and Mae 

unable to live on their own, Kyung 
is forced to take in his parents. 
Quickly, tensions begin to arise 
as Kyung’s new relationship with 
his parents resurfacse old feelings 
of guilt and anger, along with the 
constant question of how to be a 
caring father, when he was never 
shown love as a child.

Yun’s upbringing and childhood 

has shaped her writing style 
immensely. Born in South Korea, 
but raised in America, English 
is not her first language. In 
lieu 
of 
constant 

communication 
with the English 
language, 
Yun 

became 
very 

observant.

“I 
constantly 

watched 
people, 

studied 
their 

expressions 
and 

mannerisms, tried 
to glean meaning 
from 
how 
they 

behaved in addition 
to what they said,” 
Yun said. “I think this watchfulness 
carried over to my adulthood and 
it’s served me well as a writer. I 
find the disconnect between what 
people do and how they might feel 
endlessly fascinating.”

“Shelter” has already been very 

well-received and is a finalist for 
the 2016 Barnes & Noble Discover 
Great New Writers Award, the 
Goodreads Best Fiction Book of the 
Year and long-listed for the Center 
for Fiction’s First Novel Prize.

Yun claimed it is still shocking 

the way that complete strangers, 
like booksellers, librarians and 
readers, have recommended her 
novel to others. She supposes she 
had always hoped for her novels to 
be lining major bookstore shelves, 
but it has taken some getting used 
to.

“You don’t have to be Korean-

American to be broke in this 
country and living beyond your 
means to read my book. You don’t 
have to be Asian-American to 
have 
challenging 
relationships 

with your family. And you don’t 
have to be an immigrant to 
question whether you want the 
responsibility of caring for your 
elderly parents, particularly if they 
didn’t take such good care of you,” 
she said.

“These challenges are relatable 

to many, I think. I just chose 

to 
approach 

them 
from 
the 

perspective of a 
Korean-American 
family because I 
found that culture, 
ethnicity, 
class, 

immigration, 
etc. 

complicated these 
challenges 
in 

interesting 
ways 

that I wanted to 
explore,” she said. 

What I found 

most fulfilling from 

speaking with the new author 
was the advice she gave to me for 
aspiring authors. Often, young 
people trying to make it in the field 
of literature hear “keep reading.” 
But Yun points out that while this 
is important, it’s also overstated.

Instead, she told me: “Simply 

disappear.”

Her explanation: “The stories 

that instantly engage me as a 
reader, that pull me deep into 
another world, are typically stories 
driven by characters, not by the 
author’s hand. I think writers 
should be creators, not puppeteers 
— no one should see our strings 
— so I’d encourage people to be 
patient and take the time to really 
get to know their characters (as if 
they’re starting a new relationship 
because that’s essentially what 
they’re doing).” 

Lil Yachty in Paris: Young 
Boat unites the culture

Sal DiGioia/The Michigan Daily

Lil Yachty hanging above the crowd at his concert in Paris

Arts Writer Sal DiGioia travels to the French capital and 
reports on one of hip-hop’s breakout stars in a foreign land

“Est-ce que vous respectez 

Gucci Mane!?!”

I think he’s asking if the 

crowd respects Guwop? Of 
course, DJ Weedim speaks in 
French, so I can’t understand 
a single word he’s saying. Yet, 
the songs in his opening set 
are 
exclusively 
American: 

Anthems by A$AP Mob, Lil Uzi 
Vert, Playboi Carti, Migos and 
more earn emphatic reactions 
from 
Paris 
locals, 
equal 

participants in the culture.

The opening set of a rap 

concert is always a uniquely 
fraternal 
gathering, 
with 

excited fans reacting in unison 
to hit songs they have obviously 
been waiting to hear on proper 
speakers for some time. But 
on Sunday, February 26, the 
crowd at La Maroquinerie is 
particularly ecstatic, because 
Lil Yachty — the infamously 
red-haired crooner, who has 
found remarkable success as a 
part of hip-hop’s new wave — is 
sailing through the Old World, 
preparing to play his first 
concert in Paris, France. The 
energy in the venue is almost 
overbearing.

In preparation for Yachty’s 

performance, DJ Weedim is 
only playing tracks that are 
associated (either in form or 
spirit) with the Atlanta-raised 
artist’s unconventional, niche 
realm of hip-hop, and the 
French concertgoers clearly 
approve, 
their 
excitement 

vividly manifesting itself in 
wild mosh pits. More than 
once, I watch as a fan removes 
himself from the standing pit to 
take a break from the raucous 
crowd, only to hear the first 
few notes of DJ Weedim’s next 
selection, defenseless against 
his own instinct to turn up! 

Wow, what a scene! The room 

is aged primarily between 16 
and 26 years old and, naturally, 
many bodies are marked by 
notorious streetwear brands 
like Supreme and A Bathing 
Ape. Paris! Fashion!

As I anxiously await the 

arrival 
of 
Young 
Boat, 
I 

cannot help but notice some 
curious 
stares 
being 
shot 

in my direction by foreign 
hypebeasts 
who 
mistakenly 

believe that I might actually be 

somebody. It is so fascinating 
how — no matter where one 
is in this grand, vast world 
— simply wearing a Supreme 
cap and holding onto an entry-
level DLSR camera can seem 
to signal some amateur level 
of importance to those in a 
certain 
subcultural 
crowd. 

What 
is 
more 
fascinating, 

however, is that such a crowd 
exists even in Paris, France, the 
alleged home to high culture 
itself.

Some time around 21:30, Lil 

Yachty steps onto the venue’s 
small cement stage wearing 
bright red sweatpants and 
a crewneck sweatshirt the 
same shade, both of which 
are carefully matched to his 
signature braids. Though La 

Maroquinerie is much smaller 
than 
many 
of 
the 
North 

American festivals and arenas 
where he has played in recent 
months, all of the fans present 
have come out solely to see him, 
and the crowd is completely 
captivated. The energy seems 
to excite Yachty.

Yachty opens with a brief 

introductory 
skit, 
then 

dives into “Bentley Coupe” 
to bring the crowd to its 
maximum volume. He walks 
out what feels like his entire 
discography, talking through 
older, 
mellower 
songs 
like 

“Wanna Be Us” in a teaser-
like fashion before bringing 
out his most loyal sailing 
partner Burberry Perry. Perry 
helps erupt the venue on 
explosive hits like “Mase In 
‘97” (his collaboration with DJ 
Carnage). Other joint ventures, 
such 
as 
“Broccoli” 
with 

D.R.A.M. and “iSpy” by Kyle, 
are also included in the show, 
as are Yachty’s in-character 
antics. At one point, he asks if 
those in the room smoke weed 
and — after they obviously 

reply loudly in affirmation — 
announces that he and Perry 
do not. Oh, the irony.

Lil 
Yachty 
is 
a 
major 

figurehead 
for 
a 
young 

generation 
of 
rap 
stars. 

The 
Internet-fueled 
sub-

genre 
through 
which 
he 

earned 
himself 
a 
Grammy 

nomination consistently stirs 
up 
controversy 
among 
the 

genre’s older, more seasoned 
gatekeepers (think Funkmaster 
Flex). Yet, at a time when 
records are expected to flop 
and the amateur rapper market 
is especially saturated, this 
18-year-old has accomplished 
the unthinkable: He blazed 
his own odd-ball trail, fueled 
by a weirdly cool, playful 
energy and already, he has 
not only shifted the culture, 
but has apparently become an 
international star, too.

After his set, Lil Yachty 

announces that he and Perry 
will remain on stage for a bit 
to “turn up!” with fans, so 
naturally, they proceed to bop 
and boogy while Kanye West 
and Jay-Z’s hit record “N*gga’s 
In Paris” scores the scene. 
In those moments, the sheer 
sight of Yachty’s shy, boyish 
smile, standing up there in 
Paris, France with a glistening 
collection of diamond-coated 
rope chains dangling around 
his neck, literally illuminating 
(and 
illuminati-ing) 
his 

cartoonish 
persona, 
the 

underground, rainbow-headed 
rock-star, was truly a spectacle 
in itself.

Yet, the way the foreign kids 

respond to his music, and the 
energy with which they attempt 
to replicate the weirdly nasal, 
extremely specific twang in 
which he sings, shouts and 
(yes, of course) mumbles his 
lyrics — this remains the real 
sight worth emphasis, and 
breathtaking is the only word 
that can accurately describe it.

Lil Yachty’s music hardly 

make sense to most native 
English speakers. Surely, these 
French kids cannot understand 
the words? But they mouth 
along with tracks anyway, 
and 
their 
faces 
light 
up 

magnificently in his presence.

“It get colds like Minnesota!” 

It sure does, and now they 
know, even if many of them 
still have no idea where that 
place is.

‘Tickled’ digs into bizarre 
competitions, finds more

Documentary explores the strange world of competitive tickling

A few months ago my roommate 

walked into the living room of our 
apartment and told me about this 
documentary he watched called 
“Tickled.” He told me what it’s 
about, and that it’s one of the best 
(and weirdest) movies he’s seen 
in 2016. So, when I saw that HBO 
was airing the doc, I followed his 
recommendation and watched 
it. Boy, am I glad I did. “Tickled” 
might just be the most bizarre 
documentary I’ve ever seen, and 
it’s one of the best as well.

“Tickled,” directed by New 

Zealand entertainment journalist 
David Farrier and Dylan Reeve, a 
filmmaker, follows what happens 
after Farrier spots an online video 
of a competitive tickling league. 
When he reaches out to the 
company that produces the videos, 
he receives homophobic threats 
as a form of denying a request for 
an interview. The deeper he digs, 
the more legal threats he receives. 

What starts out as an absurd look 
into the world of competitive 
tickling becomes something much 
bigger, and much more nefarious.

The reason why 

I’m being slightly 
coy 
about 
what 

“Tickled” is truly 
about is a part of 
what makes this 
documentary 
so fascinating is 
watching everything unfold. The 
film knows about the absurdity 
of what happens to Ferrier and 
Reeve, and it takes great care 
of how it tells its story. There 
are twists and turns I wouldn’t 
have expected from it. By the 
time the movie finishes, it’s no 
longer about something as simple 
as 
competitive 
tickling, 
and 

has become about something 
much deeper and much more 
interesting. In this case, to say 
more would be a disservice to 
the movie, as the surprise of it all 
is one of the documentary’s best 
aspects.

For most of “Tickled,” it’s truly 

shocking how much the people 
behind the “competitive tickling” 
would want to keep it a secret, 
and the lengths they’ll go to keep 

the 
true 
reason 

for what they do 
quiet. 
Through 

this 
narrative, 

the documentary 
tackles the power 
that comes with a 
lot of money. Many 

of the participants in the tickling 
“competitions” have been doxxed 
online, and have been threatened 
with lawsuits or other life-ruining 
events. When these people are 
interviewed by Farrier and Reeve, 
the impact of these threats is clear, 
as is the tragedy of the situation.

“Tickled” introduces itself as a 

documentary that takes a look at 
the bizarre sport of competitive 
tickling. However, by its end, it 
shows itself to be so much more 
than that. It unfolds its true story 
in a way that’s as fascinating as it 
is bizarre. Farrier and Reeve have 
made one of best documentaries 
I’ve seen in a long time.

Casey Affleck won an Oscar, 

so as per usual when a rich guy 
in Hollywood with serious 
sexual allegations against him 
wins something, everyone is 
revisiting the “can you separate 
the art from the artist” debate. 
Even weeks later, my Facebook 
and Twitter feeds are full of 
people giving their own takes 
on whether this separation 
is 
possible, 
necessary 
and 

appropriate.

This debate is not new, and 

even though it has been around 
for centuries, it feels fresh, as 
the current design of American 
society 
makes 
it 
almost 

impossible not to be constant 
consumers of media, or avoid the 
social implications of everything 
we do.

Do I believe that I can like 

a movie without liking the 
heinous 
things its director 

has done? Yes. I can adore 
the 
opening 
sequence 
of 

“Manhattan” 
while 
still 

despising Woody Allen (though 
admittedly those emotions may 
be heightened for me by virtue of 
being a native New Yorker who 
really doesn’t like seeing him 
around town). But this debate 
isn’t as simple as it is made out 
to be; it holds more questions 
than just whether it’s possible to 
draw a line between artist and 
artwork.

The fundamental question 

at the root of this debate 
is whether we as a society 
believe that a person who has 
committed a crime — assuming 
for simplicity’s sake that the 
crime isn’t something banal 
like jaywalking — should be 
allowed to participate in the 
production of art. Opinions on 
this often depend on the crime 
itself, the perpetrator, the kind 
of art they want to produce, their 
current status of incarceration 
or 
punishment 
and 
their 

attitude (i.e., level of remorse). 
The 
follow-up 
question 
is 

whether they should be allowed 
to reap the benefits of others 
consuming their art, and the 
third is whether the rest of us 
should want to consume it at all.

But the reality of this debate in 

current contexts, and the reason 
I’m sure no one is confused as to 
why I’m writing about it within 
the framework of a Gender 
and Media column, is because 
nowadays when people talk 
about separating the art from 
the artist, they are almost always 
talking about sexual misconduct 
— because it is only within the 
realm of sexual misconduct that 
we have a supposed gray area the 
size of an ocean. No other kind of 
behavior or crime elicits such a 
passionate rush by the masses to 
this gray area where people sit 
and argue whether something 
does or does not count as assault, 
whether someone is or is not a 
rapist, whether she was or was 
not “asking for it” by her dress, 
her behavior, her intoxication, 
her agreement to work on that 
film or with this director. When 

it comes to allegations of sexual 
harassment or assault — against 
Casey 
Affleck, 
Bill 
Cosby, 

Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, 
Nate Parker, the list goes on 
and on — everyone seems to 
jump to defend their art while 
simultaneously diminishing the 
severity of or questioning the 
validity of the accusations.

I’m not just talking about 

Casey Affleck, or the women 
who have come out with their 
stories about his behavior. I’m 
talking 
about 
the 
rampant 

harassment and assault that 
women in this particular male-
dominated, art-based industry 
still face. I’m talking about the 
patriarchal power structures 
so 
deeply 
entrenched 
they 

leave women who do make it 
in the door — actors, writers, 
assistants, directors and those 
who do the invisible, non-
artistic work — vulnerable not 
only to these kinds of things but 
also to a boys club that protects 
their own. The rate of fake 
accusations of rape and abuse is 
incredibly low, but our society 
views those as more dangerous 
to our precious art world than 
the literal safety and well-being 
of the women involved.

Another aspect missing from 

current discussions about this 
debate is that there’s an obvious 
reflection of people’s ingrained 
attitudes towards women in the 
art that they make. People write 
what they know. Woody Allen 
knows how to be an old guy 
going after women half his age, 
so that’s what he writes. That’s 
why so many of his movies are 
so damn predictable: Beautiful 
young ingenue blinks at a 
cynical, grizzled man twice her 
age, who suddenly realizes that 
he can embrace life again. Many 
people believe the allegations 
of rape against Nate Parker to 
be true — and if they are, is it 
really a surprise that a man who 
has committed sexual assault 
directs a film in which the rape 
of women is used solely as a plot 
device to further the arcs of the 
heroic men? Is it really a surprise 
that a male-dominated industry 
produces films in which women 
are still often written as two-
dimensional archetypes — and 
when they aren’t, the writers 
are asked why they write such 
“strong female characters?” Is 
it really a surprise that the film 
industry is one of the biggest 
contributors to rape culture, 
when so many movies sexualize 
the lack of consent?

The most visceral example 

I can think of that shows how 
ingrained 
attitudes 
towards 

women is manifested in the 
production of art is the rape 
scene in Bertolucci’s film “Last 
Tango in Paris,” in which 
Marlon Brando plays a character 
who rapes Maria Schneider, 
using a stick of butter for 
lubrication. In the past year, it 
has come out that this scene 
wasn’t filmed with Schneider’s 
full consent; she was only 
informed of how they planned to 
film the scene once she arrived 
on set, and didn’t consent to 
the butter, but felt at the time 
she couldn’t say anything, as 
she was young and new and 
Brando and Bertolucci were 
stars. Bertolucci, in a revolting 
display 
of 
dehumanization, 

didn’t deny this; he defended his 
decision by saying he, “... wanted 
her reaction as a girl, not as an 
actress. I wanted her to react 
humiliated.” Instead of trusting 
that she was a capable actor 
and treating her like a fellow 
professional, he targeted the 
pain he thought she would feel 
as a woman, for whom the fear of 
gendered violence is a constant 
reality. His lack of respect for 
women was directly translated 
into the production of his art.

Last year, Lady Gaga brought 

survivors 
of 
sexual 
assault 

onstage as she sang a song about 
survival, and they received a 
standing ovation and several 
hugs from the celebrities in the 
audience. But that’s not nearly 
enough. I’m still waiting for 
someone to get up on the that 
stage and hold everyone in 
the audience accountable for 
their normalization of sexual 
harassment in the industry, that 
is both bolstered and reflected 
in the kinds of subtle misogyny 
still present in the films that they 
make. We shouldn’t be angry 
about Casey Affleck winning 
an Oscar; that’s just the natural 
culmination of the atmosphere 
in which women are often still 
expected to put up or shut up. 
It’s not that Affleck’s artistic 
performance itself is tarnished 
by his behavior; it’s that people 
shouldn’t want to work with 
him in the first place, or support 
someone who acts that way.

Fully separating the art from 

the artist is a seductive position; 
it allows us to be voracious 
consumers 
of 
art 
that 
is 

inhibited only by our own tastes 
— and for the vast majority of 
us, our strained wallets — so we 
fool ourselves into thinking it’s 
really that simple. If you believe 
that art, from conception to 
production to consumption, is 
inherently political, as I and 
most of the people I know 
do, then it isn’t that simple. It 
can’t be. This argument isn’t 
about whether the morality of 
the artist affects the intrinsic 
quality of the art; what people 
are really asking is if we should 
let our perception of the artist 
inform or affect our perception 
of the art. If you want to pretend 
it’s possible to separate the art 
from the artist, despite the fact 
that you literally can’t, as the 
art is a reflection of the artist’s 
experiences, as has been proven 
time and again, fine. But don’t 
pretend you can separate either 
the art or the artist from the 
inherently patriarchal power 
structures in which they are 
both already ingrained. 

Silence can be deafening in 

more ways than one. The silence 
that so often meets these women 
when they take the brave step 
of bringing the behavior of 
these men to light is repulsive. 
And Brie Larson’s silence — her 
refusal to clap for Affleck on 
national TV — was brave, but 
it was drowned out. I’m still 
waiting for us to get to a place 
where Casey Affleck would 
have been left standing up there, 
holding the weight of that trophy 
in his sweaty hands, looking out 
over a sea of stony faces, with a 
deafening silence ringing in his 
ears.

SOPHIA 

KAUFMAN

Circa Waves, who hurt you?

Breaking from previous sound, Circa surprises and broods

Circa Waves’ debut album 

Young Chasers exists in the 
heat of the summer: smooth 
transitions from one laidback 
song to the next putting the 
listener in the mindset of sun-
soaked afternoons, cotton clouds 
chasing down the endlessly blue 
line of the horizon. Repetitious 
but 
comforting, 
the 
album’s 

greatest strength lies in its 
genuine simplicity.

By 
contrast, 
Circa 
Waves’ 

newest 
release, 
Different 

Creatures, 
exists 
in 
harsh 

shadows.

Backed 
by 
aggressive 

harmonies 
and 
armed 
with 

pointed 
vocals, 

Different 
Creatures 
seems 

to be a complete 
rebranding 
of 

Circa 
Waves, 

trading in mellow 
for 
forceful. 

Even 
the 
two 

albums’ 
cover 

art are markedly 
dissimilar; Young 
Chasers’ 
coats 
fantastical 

imagery with hazy colors, while 
the harsh reds and blacks seen 
in Different Creatures brings to 
mind Pink Floyd’s The Wall.

The album sets its tone right 

from the opening song, “Wake 
Up.” Rapid-fire electric guitar 
chords build with intensity then 
immediately 
dissolve 
to 
the 

lyrics “So, coming, tryna break 
my fall / leaving, spitting sticks 
and stones.” “Wake Up” is jarring 
and 
initiates 
a 

bleakness 
that 

is 
reflected 

throughout the rest 
of the album.

Through 
lead 

singer 
Kieran 

Shudall’s hopeless 
vocals 
and 

melodies 
wound 
tight 
with 

tension, songs “Goodbye” and 
“A Night On The Broken Tiles” 
are grating. And while the more 
placid components of songs — 
“Fire That Burns,” “Different 

Creatures” 
and 

“Out On My Own” 
— help to create 
brief 
moments 

of 
respite 
from 

surrounding high-
energy tracks, they 
do nothing to shape 
the album overall.

Different 

Creatures is dense 
with 
similar-

sounding songs, tightly packed 
with no real sense of purpose. It’s 
easy to get lost in the constant 
antagonism. 

Circa 
Waves 
created 
an 

album wrapped in cynicism; the 

grim lyrics and downhearted 
perspective of nearly every song 
construct 
impermeable 
layers 

of negativity. It’s startling, the 
pronounced dreariness of this 
album, and a bit forced.

With 
Different 
Creatures, 

there appears to be 
a conscious push to 
be more impacting. 
Young Chasers was 
decently successful 
but unoriginal. Its 
songs are pleasant 
and 
innocuous 

but 
hardly 
novel 

enough to make waves. Through 
their newest release, Circa Waves 
seems to strive to prove that it 
can break through the generic 
indie-rock label and compose 
something influential. However, 
in this drive to make a name for 
themselves, Circa Waves lost the 
authenticity that Young Chasers, 
in all its uninspired, conventional 
glory, reverberated with.

The 
songs 
in 
Different 

Creatures 
are 
brooding 
and 

gritty but unapproachable. The 
emotions it struggles to portray 
appear distant and difficult to 
connect with. The drive behind 
the bleak vocals and the pointed 
tempos is one that is empty of any 
actual emotion. In pushing for 
notability, Circa Waves conceived 
an album that is explosive but 
empty — a hollowed out shell that 
has only decorative value.

NCAA Tournament: Breaking down the Midwest Region

By winning the Big Ten 

Tournament, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s basketball team earned 
an automatic bid into the NCAA 
Tournament. 
Once 
on 
the 

bubble, the Wolverines ripped 
off 10 wins in 12 games to make 
it into the field as the No. 7 seed 
in the Midwest Region.

Michigan 
kicks 
off 
its 

NCAA Tournament on Friday 
afternoon at 12:15 p.m. ET in 
Indianapolis, where it will take 
on No. 10 seed Oklahoma State.

If the Wolverines make it out 

of Indianapolis, they will head 
to Kansas City for the Sweet 
Sixteen and potentially the Elite 
Eight. The Final Four will be 
held in Phoenix.

With 
that, 
the 
Daily’s 

basketball beat breaks down 
the top six seeds in the Midwest 
Region as well as the team we 
think has the best chance to 
write a Cinderella story.

No. 1 Kansas

The 
Jayhawks 
may 
not 

have finished their season as 
the champions of the Big 12 
Tournament — falling to TCU, 
85-82, in the quarterfinals — 
but don’t let that fool you. The 
Midwest Region’s top seed is 
still very dangerous.

Though Kansas fell short 

against 
the 
Horned 
Frogs, 

it did so without freshman 
phenom Josh Jackson, who was 
suspended one game after being 
cited for three traffic violations. 
The Jayhawk forward is second 
on the team in both rebounding 
and 
scoring, 
averaging 
7.2 

boards and 16.4 points per game, 
respectively.

Led by senior guard Frank 

Mason III — who averages 
20.2 points per game — Kansas 
ended its regular season on an 
eight-game win streak. Though 
the 
Jayhawks 
surely 
would 

have wanted to take hardware 
home with them from the Sprint 
Center, they are poised to make 
a run at the trophy every team 
in the Big Dance is looking to 

claim.

Should the Wolverines make 

a run to the Elite Eight this 
postseason, they could likely 
find the Jayhawks standing 
between them and a Final Four.

No. 2 Louisville
If 
Michigan 
can 
manage 

to 
defeat 
Oklahoma 
State, 

Louisville 
will 
likely 
await 

in the tournament’s second 
round as a rematch of the 2013 
National Championship game. 
Just like the team that faced 
the Wolverines four years ago, 
this version of the Cardinals is 
built upon sound defense and 
strength in numbers. Louisville 
has 
the 
nation’s 
sixth-most 

efficient defense and plays with 
a 10-man rotation that will help 
give the Cardinals the physical 
edge over most any opponent 
they face.

Leading 
the 
charge 
for 

Louisville is guard Donovan 
Mitchell. The sophomore was 
a first-team all-Atlantic Coast 
Conference selection, and led 
the Cardinals in points, steals, 

three-pointers 
and 
minutes 

played. Mitchell is the engine 
behind 
Louisville’s 
offense, 

while also one of the ACC’s 
toughest lock-down defenders.

Alongside Mitchell in the 

backcourt is junior Quentin 
Snider, who will also provide a 
difficult matchup for the guard 
assigned to him on both ends of 
the court.

The Cardinals have one of the 

more 
interesting 
frontcourts 

Michigan could possibly face, as 
Louisville splits its post minutes 
fairly 
evenly 
between 
four 

different players. Anchoring the 
Cardinals’ frontcourt is center 
Anas Mahmoud. The seven-foot 
Egyptian finished second in the 
ACC in blocks per game (2.1) and 
is an imposing presence for any 
opposing offense waiting in the 
paint.

No. 3 Oregon
For the Ducks, there is more 

bad news than good news.

They are fresh off a loss 

in 
the 
Pac-12 
Tournament 

championship, received a lower 
seeding than many expected 
and 
got 
news 
that 
senior 

forward Chris Boucher is out for 
the season with a torn ACL that 
he suffered in the semifinals 
of the conference tournament 
against California.

Boucher 
was 
a 
steadying 

force for Oregon, averaging 
11.8 points, 2.5 blocks and 6.1 
rebounds — good for second on 
the team. Even with Boucher, 
the Ducks were mediocre on the 
offensive boards and even worse 
at keeping opposing offenses 
from hitting the glass hard.

Without 
Boucher, 
Oregon 

will be forced to rely even 
heavier on Dillon Brooks and 
Tyler Dorsey, who are currently 
first and second on the team in 
scoring with 16.3 and 13.3 points 
per game, respectively.

If Michigan and the Ducks 

can both advance past the 
opening 
weekend, 
the 
two 

teams will face off in the Sweet 
Sixteen in Kansas City.

No. 4 Purdue
The regular season Big Ten 

champion, No. 15 Purdue (25-
7) glided through much of the 
conference season, but turned it 
up a notch in the second half. The 
Boilermakers won eight of their 
final nine regular season games 
— falling only to No. 23 Michigan 
in Ann Arbor — to finish just 
ahead of No. 25 Wisconsin in the 
conference standings.

But Purdue’s joy ride came 

to a crashing halt in the 
postseason, as the Boilermakers 
lasted all of one day in the Big 
Ten Tournament after earning 
a double-bye. Facing off against 
Michigan once again in the 
quarterfinals, the Boilermakers 
suffered a 74-70 loss but still 
received a No. 4 seed in the 
NCAA Tournament.

No. 5 Iowa State
No. 17 Iowa State (23-10) 

weaved 
its 
way 
through 
a 

challenging Big 12 conference, 
finishing the regular season 
tied for second place with 
No. 12 Baylor and No. 13 West 
Virginia. Though the Cyclones 
fell to then-No. 2 Baylor and 
then-No. 2 Kansas in January, 
they bounced back in February 
to knock off the then-ninth-
ranked Bears and then-second-
ranked Jayhawks.

After winning six straight 

games, Iowa State lost its regular-
season finale to then-No. 10 West 
Virginia. But the bump in the road 
didn’t keep the Cyclones down 
for long, as they blitzed through 
the Big 12 Tournament all the 
way to a title. Iowa State topped 
Oklahoma State and TCU before 
capping off the run with a victory 
over the then-eleventh-ranked 
Mountaineers to receive a No. 5 
seed in the NCAA Tournament.

No. 6 Creighton
Creighton was one of the 

country’s hottest teams from 
the 
nonconference 
season 

through 
mid-January, 
once 

owning an 18-1 record with the 
lone loss coming against then-
no. 1 Villanova.

That all changed when senior 

point guard Maurice Watson 
tore his ACL at Xavier and was 
ruled out for the rest of the 
season on Jan. 17.

The Blue Jays finished the 

regular season winning just five 
of their final 12 games, which 
included an ugly 20-point loss to 
Georgetown and one-possession 
defeats 
against 
Xavier 
and 

Providence. 
Creighton 
did 

exact 
revenge 
against 
both 

those teams in the Big East 
Tournament, and reached the 
championship game where the 
Blue Jays fell to the Wildcats for 
the third time this season.

Though Watson’s 12.9 points 

and 8.5 assists per game have 
been missed, junior Marcus 
Foster has been carrying the 
Blue Jays offensively where 
Watson once would have. Foster 
now averages 18.3 points per 
game and will have to keep 
leading Creighton if the Blue 
Jays are to find any success in 
the NCAA Tournament.

Cinderella: No. 11 Rhode 

Island

With 
five 
losses 
in 
the 

Atlantic Ten, the Rams went into 
the Atlantic Ten Tournament 
squarely on the bubble.

But 
Rhode 
Island 
didn’t 

leave its NCAA Tournament 
spot up to the committee. The 
Rams won three games in 
three days — including over 
fellow tournament team, VCU, 
to clinch the Atlantic Ten 
Tournament championship and 
solidify an automatic bid to the 
Big Dance. 

Rhode 
Island’s 
biggest 

strength comes on the defensive 
end on the floor, where it is 
ranked No. 32 in the country.

It guards the 3-point line 

exceptionally 
well, 
allowing 

just 29 percent on shots behind 
the arc, which ranks No. 2 
in the country. Entering the 
tournament with seven straight 
wins, the Rams will look to keep 
rolling and bust some brackets 
in the process.

No Big Dance for ‘M’

There had been 45 minutes 

of 
chatter 
and 
giggling 

from the Michigan women’s 
basketball team as it watched 
ESPN’s selection show for the 
NCAA Tournament.

But after the final region 

was 
announced 
with 
the 

Wolverines missing from the 
bracket, the room immediately 
fell silent.

Michigan waited patiently 

for its name to be called Monday 
night. When they realized that 
moment would never come, 
the players uniformly stood 
up and huddled around fifth-
year coach Kim Barnes Arico, 
who stressed the importance 
of resiliency in the face of 
disappointment. 
Athletic 

director 
Warde 
Manuel 

hugged Barnes Arico as she 
said goodbye to her team for 
the night.

Just three weeks ago, the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team was a top-25 team in the 
country on the verge of having 
its best season in program 
history. 
And 
yet, 
Monday 

night, it was left in an all-
too-familiar position — with a 
Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament 
matchup 
with 

Kent 
State 
scheduled 
for 

Thursday. it was no wonder 
that the feeling of uneasiness 
filled every crevice of the 
room.

Despite losing four of their 

last five games and suffering 
an early exit from the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
the 
Selection 

Committee’s decision to leave 
the 
Wolverines 
(11-5 
Big 

Ten, 22-9 overall) out of the 
tournament left Barnes Arico 
and her players scratching 
their heads. Instead of the 
Tournament, Michigan will 
enter the WNIT, where the 
Wolverines 
will 
host 
the 

Golden Flashes in Ann Arbor 
for the first round.

“(I 
am) 
surprised, 

devastated, really disappointed 
— especially for our senior 
class, who has worked so hard 

and done things that haven’t 
been done in our program for a 
long time,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I just wanted them to have 
the opportunity to play in the 
NCAA Tournament. I thought 
we put ourselves in a really 
good position to be selected.

“We’ve never not been in all 

season long. We were a top-25 
team at one point. We played 
the No. 1 conference schedule. 
There were a couple of teams 
that came up that were not in 
the bracketology that would 
knock some teams out, but we 
didn’t think it would be us.”

The Big Ten had just four 

teams make the tournament, 
and most of the qualifiers 
were not seeded favorably. 
Maryland — a top-five team for 
almost the entire season and 
one of just two teams to lose 
by single digits to powerhouse 
Connecticut — was slotted 
as a No. 3 seed. Ohio State, 
Michigan State and Purdue 
rounded out the Big Ten 
representatives, seeded at No. 
4, No. 9 and No. 9, respectively.

“When that first bracket 

came out and Maryland was 
a three in the UConn bracket 
it wasn’t a good sign for us. 
... It’s just disappointing how 
they voted our league,” Barnes 
Arico said.

For much of the season, the 

Wolverines received votes in 
both the Associated Press and 
Coaches Poll, ranking as high 
as No. 20 in the Feb. 13 poll, 
and finished in third place in 
the regular season Big Ten 
standings — points that surely 
will fuel the fire for Barnes 
Arico’s team the rest of the 
way.

“They’re gonna take it and 

take advantage to prove the 
rest of the country wrong,” 
Barnes Arico said.

The Wolverines have proven 

that they can run with nearly 
any team in the country, but 
after their sluggish finish, 
they will have to iron out their 
flaws with a lot to prove as 
they prepare for their WNIT 
game 
against 
the 
Golden 

Flashes.

Freshmen prepare for first B1G Tournament

The Michigan hockey team 

is on a roll heading into the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament. 
The 

Wolverines have won four of 
their last five games and just 
capped off their first weekend 
sweep of the season against No. 
15 Penn State.

With Michigan getting set 

to take on the Nittany Lions 
again Thursday in its first-
round matchup, it would be 
reasonable 
to 
assume 
the 

Wolverines are prepared for 
the familiar opponent. But 
almost 
immediately 
after 

Michigan beat Penn State 4-0 
on Saturday, senior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort was quick 
to say that Thursday could be 
completely different.

“We’re going to talk about 

this Monday when we show 
up to the rink; what we played 
tonight, the game is going to be 
so much more intense than that 
next 
Thursday,” 
Nagelvoort 

said. “It’s just a whole different 
animal when you get to the 
playoffs. We’ve seen it every 
year when we’ve gotten to 
the Big Ten (Tournament). 
So that’s what we’re looking 
forward to. Yes, we’re playing 
the best hockey, but we’re 
going to continue to grow and 
play even better hockey if we 
want to make it last longer than 
a game.”

Most 
of 
the 
Wolverines 

have experienced the change 
of 
pace 
that 
comes 
with 

playoff hockey. Yet, as has 
been the narrative all season, 
the freshmen on the team are 
expected to contribute heavily. 
For them, this weekend will be 
the first time they’ve played in 
the conference tournament.

According 
to 
Michigan 

coach Red Berenson, whether 
or not the freshmen, and as a 
result the whole team, will be 
ready for Thursday depends 
on their preparation up to this 
point. 

“This time of year, you just 

can’t turn on a switch and 

say, ‘I’m going to turn on last 
year’s 
switch,’ 
” 
Berenson 

said. “You’ve got to build up 
momentum during the year, 
and even this week. This is a 
time 
to 
just 

focus on this 
one 
game. 

Like, we might 
only have one 
game left, and 
we’ve got to be 
ready for it.”

A 
few 
of 

the 
freshmen 

have 
their 

own 
playoff 

experiences 
from their time playing juniors. 
Forward Jake Slaker tallied 
12 points in 10 playoff games 
with the Bloomington Thunder 
in the United States Hockey 
League last season.

But just as the transition 

from juniors to college hockey 
requires 
some 
adjustments, 

Slaker knows that the Big Ten 
Tournament 
will 
bring 
an 

intensity he hasn’t seen yet.

“I know it’s a whole different 

game,” Slaker said. “Right now 
we have some confidence with 
these last few weekends. We 
got some big wins against some 

better teams. I 
think right now 
we know it’s a 
new season.”

For 
those 

who don’t have 
experience, this 
weekend 
will 

not just bring a 
competitiveness 
they 
haven’t 

experienced 
before, 
but 

it could also bring a larger 
workload than what they’re 
used to. After all, if things go 
how the Wolverines want them 
to, they will be playing in three 
games in three days.

To prepare for this potential 

stress on their bodies, Michigan 
has put an emphasis on making 
sure its conditioning is where it 
needs to be.

“Our goal is to play three 

games this weekend,” said 
freshman 
forward 
Will 

Lockwood. 
“… 
We’ve 
been 

taking some time out of the 
weight room and focusing on 
being on the ice, being in good 
shape, but being well rested at 
the same time. So just having 
that confidence coming into 
the weekend and knowing that 
we’re going to want to play 
three games, everyone’s got to 
take care of themselves and be 
ready.” 

All 
of 
this 
has 
been 

discussed all year, though. 
The Wolverines have known 
throughout this tumultuous 
season 
that 
they 
need 
to 

improve, and this week is no 
different. 

“I don’t think we have to do a 

lot of scouting,” Berenson said. 
“It’s more about understanding 
our opponent, but really getting 
the most out of our group. We 
know that we can play better, 
and we have to play a lot better. 
... They’re a really good team, 
and we have to play better.”

Nagelvoort gives ‘M’ a chance
T

he Michigan hockey team 
has found success over its 
last few games, and, like 

when it had some success early 
in the season, it has done so with 
goaltending. 

Then, the 

Wolverines 
relied on a 
rotation of 
goaltenders 
— freshman 
Hayden 
Lavigne 
earned two 
shutouts in 
the first nine 
games of the 
season, and strong performances 
from freshman Jack LaFontaine 
and senior Zach Nagelvoort led 
Michigan to victories against 
Ferris State, Arizona State and 
Lake Superior State.

Unfortunately for the 

Wolverines, the netminders 
could not sustain their level of 
play, especially with the volume 
of shots they began to face. 
Immediately after Michigan’s 
series against the Lakers, 
it traveled to take on Penn 
State, where LaFontaine and 
Nagelvoort were peppered with 
106 shots over two games and 
gave up 11 goals.

It was a series that sent the 

goaltending, and the team as a 
whole, into a downward spiral, 
as the Wolverines gave up two or 
more goals in 14 of their next 15 
games, accruing a 3-10-2 record 
over that span.

Michigan has righted the ship 

once again, winning four of its 
last five games heading into the 
Big Ten Tournament. Saturday, 
the Wolverines completed their 
first weekend sweep of the 
season against the 11th-ranked 
Nittany Lions, and the 
importance of good goaltending 
was never more apparent.

Nagelvoort again faced a bevy 

of shots from Penn State, but 
this time, he was up to the task. 
The senior stuffed all 46 of the 
Nittany Lions’ shots, fueling 
Michigan’s 4-0 victory.

The shutout was Nagelvoort’s 

second of the season and his 
third win in his past three 
starts. Paired with Lavigne’s 

winning effort in net Friday, the 
Wolverines turned in perhaps 
their most impressive weekend 
of the season, and it was fueled, 
once again, by their goaltending.

“Yes, it’s the best we’ve played 

so far, I think,” Nagelvoort said 
after Saturday’s game. “But I 
think we’ve played really well in 
spurts throughout the season, 
and I think we’re figuring out 
how to put it together now. And 
that’s important now that we’re 
going into playoff hockey.

“We’re going to talk about this 

Monday when we show up to the 
rink; what we played tonight, the 
game is going to be so much more 
intense than that next Thursday. 
It’s just a whole different animal 
when you get to the playoffs. 
We’ve seen it every year when 
we’ve gotten to the Big Ten 
(Tournament). So that’s what 
we’re looking forward to. Yes, 
we’re playing the best hockey, 
but we’re going to continue to 
grow and play even better hockey 
if we want to make it last longer 
than a game.”

Nagelvoort is right. If 

Michigan doesn’t improve at all 
heading into next weekend, it 
might be able to beat Penn State 
in its first-round matchup. But 
then the Wolverines will have 
to face No. 5 Minnesota, a team 
they have beaten only once in 
four tries this season, with the 
one win coming as a result of a 
late-game, three-goal flurry.

Yet, in playoff hockey, 

sometimes all it takes is a 
hot goaltender to make the 
difference for a team. And with 
Nagelvoort’s recent string of 
performances, Michigan will 
almost surely turn to him again 
next weekend.

So the Wolverines will need to 

play their best hockey to win the 
Big Ten Tournament and move 
on to the NCAA Tournament, 
and maybe that won’t even be 
enough. But if Nagelvoort can 
repeat his performance from last 
weekend, he will at least give 
Michigan a chance.

Baseball, and optimism, at Ray Fisher this weekend
I

t doesn’t take more than a 
couple of seconds for Ako 
Thomas to address it. The 

question wasn’t even about 
it. But to 
start an 
interview 
in the 
lobby of 
Ray Fisher 
Stadium on 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
asked what 
has gone 
well as 
Thomas 
and the Michigan baseball 
team have raced out to a 12-3 
start this year, the sophomore 
second baseman knows just the 
answer.

“We felt like we had 

something to prove this year,” 
Thomas says, “ending the way 
we did last year.”

Of course, everyone in the 

program remembers that. 
Last season, as the Wolverines 
were on their way to their best 
season in eight years, they 
instead sputtered, losing nine of 
their last 11 games and missing 
the NCAA Tournament for the 
seventh time in eight tries.

Twelve months later, last 

season’s optimism is back, and 
Michigan has the promise to 
back it up. The Wolverines’ 
quest now is to make sure they 
don’t repeat 2016.

“I just felt like towards the 

end, I feel like we just, I don’t 
know, got tired and started to 
fall apart towards the end,” 
Thomas said. “But with this 
year’s group, I just feel like we 
all have the same goals. We’ve 
all got one thing on our mind, 
and that’s winning each game.”

Michigan returns home 

to Ray Fisher Stadium as a 
ranked team this weekend 
for a four-game series against 
Northern Illinois. A month 
into this season, a 15-game 
road swing has gone about as 
well as the Wolverines could 
have hoped. They have started 

12-3 — improving on their 
15-game start last season — 
including a 7-1 spring break 
trip to California in which 
they knocked off Southern 
California and San Diego, 
which doesn’t happen often to 
teams from the cold Midwest.

Michigan came back and 

drew a No. 24 ranking in the 
national poll. The only other 
ranked team from north of the 
Mason-Dixon Line and east of 
the West Coast was No. 19 St. 
John’s. And the Wolverines 
will likely move up in this 
week’s poll after going down 
to Nashville and sweeping 
Lipscomb this past weekend.

The catch is that all of that 

was true at this time last year 
— the hot start, the national 
ranking and a 5-0 win against 

then-No. 10 California.

Last year’s squad started 5-0, 

then went to 11-3, then 20-5 
after sweeping Northwestern. 
Those Wolverines showed a 
few signs of letting up, but 
they were still 34-12 after 
they pounded Rutgers in May. 
Most 34-12 teams end up in the 
NCAA Tournament.

But Michigan finished 2-9 

and lost to Ohio State five times 
in the last three weeks — twice 
in the Big Ten Tournament. 
Had the Wolverines won 
any one of those games, they 
might have returned to the 
postseason. Instead, the 
momentum they gained from 
a dramatic run to the 2015 
conference tournament title 
disappeared. Michigan still 
finished with its best record 

since it won the last of three 
straight Big Ten titles in 2008, 
but it had nothing to show for it.

So yes, Thomas and coach 

Erik Bakich admit, the 
Wolverines have the proverbial 
“chip on their shoulder” — “if 
we said there wasn’t, we’d 
be lying to you,” Bakich said 
Wednesday. They do not 
deny the influence last year’s 
collapse had on this season’s 
start. They embrace it.

“I think last year and this 

year, there was definitely 
optimism,” said senior infielder 
Michael Brdar. “I think the 
difference this year is we’re a 
lot more motivated and tough 
towards our goals. Not that 
we expected to be great last 
year, but we kind of just had, 
‘we’re going to show up and 

we’re going to play well.’ This 
year, it’s more like we get to the 
ballpark and we’re on a mission 
every single game.”

The result is a team that 

again looks like it’s ready to 
take the next step as a program. 
Michigan now ranks tied for 
third in the country with 
30 stolen bases and has the 
pitching, led by ace left-hander 
Oliver Jaskie, to compete with 
anyone.

The evolution came in the 

offseason when Michigan 
reevaluated how it approached 
games as a program. First, 
according to Brdar, that meant 
what the team calls “mental 
toughness” — or in practice, a 
lot of running. The Wolverines 
also adopted a more aggressive 
mindset (which shows in the 

stolen base category) and 
discussed as a group what 
values were most important to 
them.

The beliefs they thought of 

as implicit, they made more 
specific. The classic ideals of 
baseball — every pitch matters 
— they have now seen in action.

“You always talk about that, 

but we never really saw it until 
last year, so now we know that 
it’s important to have intent 
with everything we do,” Brdar 
said. “…I think the end of last 
year helped, because there’s 
no taking the foot off the gas 
pedal.”

In response to a slump in 

which the Wolverines could 
never manage the win they 
needed, they have come back 
this year believing they’re never 
out of any game.

The intensity has paid off. 

Against Creighton last month, 
Michigan blew a three-run 
lead in the ninth inning and 
then rallied to win in the 10th. 
At Lipscomb on Friday night, 
the Wolverines rallied from 
down 4-2 in the ninth and won 
5-4. They believe last year’s 
sour finish helped build that 
resiliency.

“Maybe now more than 

ever, we’re going to be able to 
embrace, you know, when the 
garbage hits the fan,” Bakich 
said.

Wednesday, the fifth-year 

coach jogged into the Ray 
Fisher lobby for a media session 
with reporters and took a seat 
facing a wall plastered with a 
photo of the team celebrating 
the 2015 Big Ten Tournament 
title.

Looking at that picture, 

he reaffirmed that no, this 
season’s early success will not 
influence his team as it heads 
into a promising spring. By now, 
Michigan knows the danger of 
that already.
