Next semester, a new one-

credit 
class 
titled 
“Fake 

News, Lies, and Propaganda: 
How 
to 
Sort 
Fact 
from 

Fiction” will be offered to 
undergraduate students by 
the University of Michigan 
library system. The class will 
be aimed at dispelling biases 
about the news and teaching 
students how to look at media 
with a more critical eye.

Though 
the 
topic 
of 

fake news has been widely 
discussed 
in 
the 
context 

of 
the 
current 
political 

climate, 
Doreen 
Bradley, 

the 
University’s 
director 

of learning programs and 
initiatives—who is one of the 
four designers of the course—
said the course has broader 
roots.

“I think the whole political 

environment kind of raised 
the issue even more, but our 
sense was that this was a 
needed issue even before the 
political turmoil of the fall,” 
Bradley said. “It will include 
things, obviously, related to 
politics, but we really want 
to focus on things like if you 
get something about health 
news, how do you know if 
you can rely on that health 
news? So we really want to 
make it a course that applies 
to students’ entire lives.”

After years of citizen protests 

and government consideration, 
Ann Arbor officials are finally 
moving forward with the first 
phase of a proposal to review 
the practices of the Ann Arbor 
Police Department.

At its Feb. 21 meeting, City 

Council approved a $200,000 
contract with Hillard Heintze 
LLC, a Chicago-based security 
consulting 
firm, 
to 
assess 

community 
perceptions 
of 

AAPD and its practices and 
make recommendations for the 
implementation of a civilian 
review board.

Though 
the 
firm’s 
plan 

states that it will “provide 
recommendations for a model 
and 
implementation 
plan 

for Civilian Oversight of the 
APD 
(sic),” 
any 
potential 

civilian board would likely 
not have any oversight power 
other 
than 
non-binding 

recommendations — the city 
charter charges City Council 
and 
the 
city 
administrator 

have sole oversight over the 
police department. According 
to Councilmember Chip Smith 
(D–Ward 5), however, part of 
Hillard Heintze’s research will 
be to assess how an advisory 
board could work in tandem 
with the council.

“Ultimately 
as 
a 
council 

person, I look for a board like 
that to give me advice on actions 
to take,” he said. “You know if 

there are complaints about an 
action or an officer, certainly I 
want to know what Chief Baird 
says about it, but I also want the 
independent group to be able to 
provide me their interpretation 
of what happened and how to 
best proceed.”

And even after the firm 

makes the recommendations 
for 
implementation 
of 
a 

civilian advisory board, its 
enactment would still have to 

be passed by a vote from the 
council. Councilmember Julie 
Grand (D–Ward 3) expects the 
measure to go through.

“I would like to believe 

that 
I 
would 
be 
very 

confident in supporting (the 
recommendation) and that my 
fellow council members would 
be very confident in supporting 
the recommendations of this 
group,” she said.

Though Jim Baird, the Ann 

Arbor police chief, wrote in 
a memo to the council last 
June 
he 
would 
support 
a 

civilian review board if it were 
recommended by a third-party 
audit. He maintained, however, 
he did not personally view the 
body as necessary.

“Following an audit of the 

Ann Arbor Police Department 
is the logical time to evaluate 
whether 
a 
Civilian 
Police 

The future of a controversial 

high-rise plan on a contested piece 
of land in Ann Arbor is coming to 
an apex as the City Council has 
announced a special work session 
on March 16 to discuss the issue in 
more detail.

The real estate, located between 

Liberty and Williams streets on 5th 
Avenue, is currently a surface and 
underground parking lot called the 
Library Lane Parking Structure. 
Last year, City Council selected 
Chicago developer Core Spaces as 
a finalist to redevelop the property 
as a $10 million, 17-story high-rise. 
The building would include 357 
apartments and 131 hotel rooms, in 
addition to office and retail space as 
well as an outdoor plaza.

However, such an ambitious 

project provoked ire and scrutiny 
from citizen groups who felt 
constructing 
another 
high-rise 

downtown was unnecessary.

Last year, the Ann Arbor 

Committee for the Community 
Commons delivered a petition to 
put the future of the Library Lot to 
the November election ballot, but it 
fell short of signatures. Alan

Jewish Community Center evacuated after report of backpack bomb on Monday

Last Monday morning, Ann 

Arbor’s 
Jewish 
Community 

Center 
was 
evacuated 
after 

the Hebrew Day School of Ann 
Arbor, located within the center, 
received a call claiming a bomb 

was hidden inside a backpack in 
the school.

The school administration and 

Ann Arbor police determined 
there was no bomb after a 
thorough search of the school 
and community center, and the 
200 students were allowed back 
into the building two hours after 
the bomb threat was made.

Over 20 Jewish schools in 11 

states received similar threats 
on the same morning. Ann Arbor 
police Lt. Matthew Lige told 
ClickOn Detroit the police and 
school officials are collaborating 
with the FBI to determine the 
source of the call.

Despite the phone calls that 

morning, there have been no 

attacks on any of the schools.

According to CNN, calls of the 

same nature have been received 
by 68 Jewish Community Centers 
across the nation since January. 
A 
bullet 
was 
shot 
through

Math homework has taken to a 

new beat recently with the work of 

SKULE.org not only in Ann Arbor 

and Detroit, but nationwide. 

SKULE.org — a new education-

based nonprofit — released an 

educational rap video titled “99 

Math Problems” mid-February, an 

homage to Jay-Z’s “99 Problems”. 

The video received 400,000 views 

in its first week and was praised by 

schoolteachers around the country. 

Educational rapper Rohen Shah, the 

founder of SKULE.org and the face of 

MC SKULE, said as soon as the song 

was released, he and his team sent it 

to local school principals in the Ann 

Arbor and Detroit areas. From there, 

it reached the national level.

Adhering to the tune of rapper 

Jay-Z’s original the video features 

middle schoolers singing and 

dancing at their school. At the center 

of the video is MC SKULE, a rapper 

who encourages students to treat 

math as an enjoyable challenge, 

and to not be afraid of attempting 

problems.

The video discusses fractions, 

multiplication and other basic math 

principles.

He said schoolteachers around 

the country have been messaging the 

organization to say how much their 

students have enjoyed the videos.

“Mostly the feedback was that 

they used it in their classrooms and 

the students loved it,” he said. “Some 

even said that it helped some of the 

students who usually wouldn’t speak 

out in class make comments.”

Shah added that with enhanced 

technology today, it’s hard to keep 

kids engaged in class, when they are 

more likely to be become addicted 

to a Netflix show or listen to a song 

several times.

“Rather than forcing them to pay 

attention to the math, why not make 

the math compelling?” he said.

SKULE stands for Spread 

Knowledge Using Lyrics & 

Entertainment, as is the company’s 

mission. According to its website, 

it aims to build a community of 

educators and artists to make 

learning fun for students.

In October, DiagKNOWstics 

Learning, an Ann Arbor company 

co-founded by Shah, posted the first 

MC SKULE video to explain the 

Electoral College to young voters.

Shah said then the goal of the 

educational rap tool is to reach 

students who may be struggling to 

learn concepts that are not actually 

difficult but are often presented in a 

complex way.

“We decided to do something 

more innovative, something that will 

grab their attention a little bit more 

and something to get them excited,” 

he said.

On Feb. 28, President Donald 

J. Trump signed an executive 
order demanding a review of 
the 
controversial 
Waters 
of 

the United States rule. The 
act, signed in during Barack 
Obama’s presidency, allows for 

the regulation and protection 
of smaller bodies of water in the 
country. Reports were also leaked 
regarding a 97 percent funding cut 
for the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative.

University 
of 
Michigan 

experts have spoken out against 
the executive order, as well as 
another order expected out of the 
Oval Office that would withdraw 

Obama’s Clean Power Plan that 
aims to curb emissions from 
coal-fired power plants. The 10 
University experts are making 
themselves available to discuss the 
effects of the orders, according to 
a press release from the Michigan 
News.

Controversy surrounded the 

Waters of the United States rule 
when it was first established in 

2015, with supporters touting 
it as a public health necessity 
and opponents saying it was 
an act of overregulation. In 
his statement upon signing 
his executive order, Trump 
criticized the act, calling it a 
“power grab” from the EPA.

“The EPA’s so-called Waters 

of the United States rule is one 
of the worst examples of federal 
regulation … a few years ago, 
the EPA decided that navigable 
waters can mean nearly every 
puddle or every ditch on a 
farmer’s land or anyplace else 
that they decide,” Trump said. 
“Right? It was a massive power 
grab.”

However, University Law 

Prof. David Uhlmann, who 
is an expert on the Waters of 
the United States rule, said 
Trump’s decision to roll back 
the rule is a critical error.

“The 
president 
ignores 

elementary school science: 
The health of America’s 
rivers and streams — and the 
drinking water for countless 
cities and towns — depends 
upon the protection of the 
headwaters 
streams 
and 

tributaries that flow into 
our rivers and streams,” 
Uhlmann said. “With each 
passing 
day, 
it 
becomes 

apparent 
that 
‘making 

America great again’ means 
turning back the clock to 
a pre-1970s era of racial 
discrimination, sexism and 
rivers on fire.”

Monday, March 6, 2017 — 3A

cemeteries in three different 
states have been vandalized in 
recent weeks.

Recent threats in southeast 

Michigan 
go 
beyond 
the 

Jewish 
community, 
too. 
A 

threatening 
voicemail 
was 

left at the American Muslim 
Society in Dearborn on Feb. 19, 
claiming Muslims are “agents 
of Satan” and that they “will be 
eradicated.” The FBI has also 
been called upon to investigate 
this voicemail. In December, 
the Ann Arbor Islamic Center 
received an anti-Muslim, pro-
Trump 
letter 
with 
similar 

remarks.

On Friday, former journalist 

Juan Thompson, a St. Louis 
resident, was arrested in New 
York for making some of the 

bomb threat calls to Jewish 
centers around the country, but 
law enforcement officials do not 
think Thompson was behind 
other calls.

While there has been no 

information released regarding 
whether Thompson made the 
call to Ann Arbor last week, 
officials 
discovered 
he 
was 

responsible for a bomb threat to 
a Jewish school in Farmington 
Hills, Mich., at the beginning of 
February.

David Shtulman, the executive 

director of the Ann Arbor Jewish 
Federation, feels dismayed by the 
attacks. He said he wants more 
of a response from the Ufederal 
level.

“It’s 
sad 
that 
this 
is 

happening,” 
Shtulman 
said. 

“I think it’s part of the larger 
sadness that’s happening all 
across the country to all kinds 
of groups. Personally, I wish 
that the president of the United 

States would speak out a little 
bit more forcefully. It’s time 
for the administration to really 
speak out and say, ‘We’re not 
going to tolerate this anymore.’ “

President Donald J. Trump, 

whose senior adviser, Steve 
Bannon, 
penned 
several 

anti-Semitic 
articles, 
issued 

a 
statement 
condemning 

anti-Semitic acts on Feb. 21. 
However, many Jewish leaders, 
in the same vein as Shtulman, 
criticized 
the 
president 
for 

not responding to the acts — 
which have been occurring 
consistently since the beginning 
of January — sooner or in a more 
personalized fashion.

“The 
anti-Semitic 
threats 

targeting our Jewish community 
and community centers are 
horrible and are painful and a 
very sad reminder of the work 
that still must be done to root 
out hate and prejudice and evil,” 
Trump said.

Review Board is warranted,” 
he wrote. “The commission’s 
report does not identify or even 
suggest systemic issues within 
the ranks or leadership of the 
agency that would warrant such 
a step.”

At 
the 
time 
of 
this 

publication, Baird could not 
be reached for comment on 
whether his opinion on such a 
review board had changed.

Relations between civilians 

and police across the nation 
reached a tipping point in 
August 2014 after a white 
policeman 
fatally 
shot 

unarmed 
Black 
teenager 

Michael Brown in Ferguson, 
Mo. 
After 
the 
November 

2014 shooting death of Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser 
by a police officer, which was 
ruled as justified self-defense, 
local protests against police 
violence rallied around Rosser 
as a symbol for those affected 

by similar incidents of police 
violence.

One of the main functions 

of an advisory board would 
be to review complaints made 
against police officers and 
provide advice to the council 
and AAPD regarding next 
steps. In the memo, Baird 
also defended the complaint 

process, saying it could not 
be as transparent as a report 
from 
the 
Human 
Rights 

Commission 
suggested 
it 

should be.

“Due to the nature of the 

work officers perform and 
the conditions they perform it 

under, much of it must remain 
opaque,” he wrote. “However, 
we should always be in a 
state 
of 
self 
examination 

to determine if there are 
areas where we can be more 
transparent.”

Councilmember 
Graydon 

Krapohl (D–Ward 4) said he 
thought a civilian advisory 
board would be a way to shift 
the examination process from 
the police department to an 
independent body.

“The complaint process is 

done internally through the 
police department,” Krapohl 
said. “I don’t want to say 
exactly off the top of my head 
–– complaints are brought in 
and then they are reviewed 
by senior officers, but all 
complaints are taken seriously, 
reviewed 
and 
investigated. 

We’re hoping through the 
audit, you know, how can we 
improve this process? That 
has been something –– maybe 
not everyone feels comfortable 
coming into the police station 
to make a complaint, and I 
think that’s understandable.”

and 
became 

Assistant Director of Sexual 
Misconduct in 2016,” Harper 
wrote. “During that time, 
Nadia worked with close 
campus partners to provide

around 
the 
new 

Sexual Misconduct Policy 
and 
its 
implementation. 

She has provided oversight 
to case management and

Harper 
also 
noted 

Bazzy’s experience working 

with minority groups at a

her 
invitation 
to 
attend 

a 
White 
House 
session 

regarding the experiences of 
Asian Americans — as well 
as Muslim, Arab and Sikh 
communities — this past 
winter.

“This past December, Nadia 

was invited to a White House 
session that focused on the 
generational experiences of 
Asian Americans, including 
Japanese-Americans 
placed 

in internment camps during 
World War II, as well as 
modern day challenges facing 
the Asian American and Pacific 
Islander (AAPI) and Muslim, 
Arab, Sikh, and South Asian 
(MASSA) communities today,” 
he wrote.

According to Bradley, the 

concept of discerning the 
truthfulness of online news 
comes up in many other 
courses at the University. The 
new class builds off these 
predecessors, 
like 
Applied 

Liberal Arts 105, a class about 
digital research.

“We teach a current course 

called ALA 105, and in it 
we do a segment on news 
to begin with, even just 
evaluating general websites 
that students find on the 
web,” Bradley said. “We just 
have seen over the past couple 
years a need to evaluate news 
and other types of non-
scholarly information.”

Social media has played 

a role in the fake news 
problem. Facebook has been 
heavily criticized in its role 
in dispensing unreliable news 
sources to users’ newsfeeds. 
Recently, the site has added 
warning labels to posts that 
have disputed information.

Because 
of 
the 
role 

libraries play in helping to 
sort out different types of 
information, Bradley thinks 
the library system is the 
perfect place for the new 
course. She wants to use the 
class to teach students the 
skills librarians — and many 
other professions — must use 
every day.

“As 
librarians, 
this 
is 

exactly what we do,” she said. 
“We evaluate everything that 
comes through — who wrote 
it, what’s it purpose, what is 
their purpose in (writing) it … 
everybody’s being asked to do 
research, whether you need 
to find this or that, and it’s a 

skill that everybody needs.”

Angela 
Dillard, 
LSA 

associate 
dean 
for 

undergraduate education, told 
the Michigan News a critical 
view of the media is a crucial 
part of a well-rounded liberal 
arts education. She echoed 
Bradley’s thoughts that the 
new class focuses on a more 
specific part of that skill.

“Teaching students to be 

critical consumers of news and 
information is part of a good 

liberal arts education,” Dillard 
said. “Students are learning 
this skill in all their classes. 
But today there is so much 
information that learning how 
to assess its validity is more 
challenging than ever. This 
course addresses that need.”

Bradley 
and 
the 
other 

librarians involved in the 
course don’t yet know what 
kind of response there will 
be to the course, but they’re 
hoping 
to 
attract 
many 

students. 
As 
a 
one-credit 

mini-course, the class will 
only last the first seven weeks 
of the fall semester and will 
be 
taught 
by 
University 

librarians. 

LSA 
senior 
Rebecca 

Rothbart, the president of 
the Michigan Association of 
Communication Studies, said 
she sees connections between 
the fake news course and her 
communication classes. She 
said she is interested to see 
what the mini-course leads 
to, but also how the topic of 
fake news will be further 
integrated into other classes 
at the University.

“I think from my standpoint 

as a comm student, this course 
seems to align with other 
coursework 
we’ve 
talked 

about, and even is a topic I’m 
sure will be integrated into 
future 
courses,” 
Rothbart 

said. “I think if it becomes 
… a class (communication 
students) 
can 
get 
credit 

for, it would definitely be a 
worthwhile class to take.” 

Haber, the leader of the petition, 

has criticized the council’s decision 
to sell the lot and said he wanted to 
build a civic commons on it.

“Sometimes 
it 
seems 
(City 

Council members) would sell their 
mother if the price was right, and 
not even notice they were doing 
it, and they are trying to do that 
right now, not noticing what never-
to-be center of community they 
are selling away,” Haber wrote in 
a Facebook post for the AACCC. 
“This citizen initiative is the 
alternative to 17 floor luxury hotel/
condo development, Chicago style., 
or its successor waiting to buy it out 
from under us.”

Haber and others’ concerns 

have majority support from the 
community. A 2013 Park Advisory 
Commission survey showed 76.2 
percent of respondents thought 
Ann Arbor would benefit from more 
downtown open spaces — such as 
a park or town square — and 41.5 
percent of respondents chose the 
Library Lot as the best option to 
build such a space.

Will Hathaway, a member of the 

Library Green Conservancy, a group 
that advocates for apportioning a 
part of the library lot as a public 
open space, is one such individual. 
Hathaway argued that the high-rise 
is mired with problems, the most 
important being parking.

According 
to 
Hathaway, 
of 

the more than 700 underground 
parking spaces of the Library Lot, 
Core Spaces is planning to purchase 
or lease 196 of the spaces. However, 
he said 196 is not a sufficient 
number to satisfy all inhabitants 
of the high-rise, so Core Spaces 
is asking for another 85 parking 
spaces and 80 off-peak permits in 
the nearby parking lot on 4th Street 
and Williams Avenue. Hathaway 
argued even that is too little and 
would create a massive shortage of 
parking spots.

“The rest of the people who 

don’t get a dedicated parking space 
who are in this building are going 
to be in the mix with all the rest 
of us looking for parking spaces,” 
Hathaway said. “So the impact goes 
way beyond those parking spaces 
that they’re proposing to take out of 
the system.”

However, 
Councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D–Ward 3) 
argued the surface parking lot 
and 196 spaces underground were 
built expressly with the purpose 
of building a structure above it. He 
also noted that of the 160 spaces at 

Fourth and William, only 80 can 
only be used during off-peak hours. 
Therefore, Ackerman said, the real 
issue is the other 80 spaces, which 
he said is more than enough of a 
trade-off for the high-rise.

Ackerman noted that with the 

high-rise, Ann Arbor will gain a 
much-needed 20,000 square feet of 
office space for the tech community, 
as well as 120 apartments and 3,350 
square feet of retail space. He added 
the benefits do not end there.

“Each of these (spaces) will 

help activate 12,000 square feet 
of public plaza that will be built 
and 
maintained 
with 
private 

dollars,” Ackerman said. “This is 
important to note because our Parks 
Department is already responsible 
for maintaining 2,200 acres of 
parkland with a $14 million budget 
that they use in its entirety every 
year.”

Ackerman’s assertion has some 

backing in Councilmember Kirk 
Westphal’s (D–Ward 2) comment 
regarding Haber’s attempt at the 
petition. Westphal told the Daily 
in June the future of the parking 
lot as a high-rise was decided 
through a transparent public 
process.

“Before I was involved in city 

government, I participated as a 
citizen in the Calthorpe process 
for downtown over 10 years ago,” 
Westphal said. “The state of that 
particular parcel has not been 
contentious at all for decades, so 
going to the voters about a single 
piece of property didn’t seem 
to be a good use of the ballot 
mechanism.”

Ackerman reasoned that in a 

state which prohibits rent control, 
increasing supply and competition 
is the best way to bring prices 
down for residents. He also noted 
that 42 of the housing units will 
be workforce housing, which 
will house individuals making 
$45,000 to $60,000 a year, 80 
to 100 percent of Ann Arbor’s 
median income. Moreover the city 
will appropriate half of the $10 
million revenue from the high-rise 
to the Affordable Housing Fund.

In a meeting last Wednesday, 

the 
Downtown 
Development 

Authority decided to lease the 
360 parking spaces for 50 years, 
the minimum that Core Spaces 
deemed necessary. The proposal 
is heading to the council, where 
it would be approved at an 
undetermined date.

Hathaway also said the real 

estate biome around the parking 
lot is also problematic for building 
a massive high-rise. He said 
that the Core Spaces proposal 

encroaches on a piece of land the 
council designated as a public 
open space in 2014, and other 
developers may take Core Spaces 
to court in order to prevent a high-
rise from casting a shadow over 
their planned developments.

“Part of what we’re hoping 

is that we can avoid this whole 
protracted battle over who has 
a legal right to do whatever they 
want here and here, and instead 
get the community to step back 
and say, ‘Well, what would be 
the best way to develop this 
and this and this so that it all 
hangs together and supports the 
downtown around it instead of 
just treating each site in isolation?’ 
” Hathaway said. “It’s better from 
an urban planning perspective. … 
It’s more holistic to think about the 
relationship between all of these 
different sites and how they could 
knit together the downtown.”

Hathaway 
and 
Ackerman 

found common ground, however, 
in creating affordable housing 
for Ann Arborites with modest 
means.

Hathaway contended that Core 

Spaces may be adding luxury 
student housing in the building 
to ease the parking issue, but 
suggested the council apportion 
the land for affordable housing.

“If they use this site and a 

build a more modest building 
that included a 100 or 200 units 
of workforce housing, that could 
really help to create a more 
vibrant downtown,” Hathaway 
said. “You have people, in theory, 
who are the workers who work 
downtown 
living 
downtown, 

so less traffic congestion, less 
pressure on parking.”

Ackerman 
said 
instead 
of 

building affordable housing on 
the Library Lot, the council is 
building it across the street.

This 
year, 
the 
council 
is 

purchasing back this property, 
known as the Y Lot, for $4 
million 
from 
the 
high-rise 

revenue because there was no 
development since selling the 
land in 2014. Ackerman said City 
Council is bringing 250 units 
of affordable housing on the 
Y Lot and leftover land in the 
Library Lot, and contended this 
was a smarter way to solve the 
affordable housing problem.

“Talking 
about 
affordable 

and 
workforce 
housing 
only 

becomes lip service if we do 
nothing to build it,” Ackerman 
said. “Leaving this opportunity 
on the table is not just inaction 
on workforce housing, it’s action 
against workforce housing.”

T

he 
term 
“supernova” 

is used to describe the 
extremely 
dramatic 

destruction of massive stars within 
our 
universe. 
This 

occurs in the final 
stages of stellar life 
as a star burns its last 
amounts of helium and 
hydrogen, 
expanding 

to an incomprehensible 
size 
and 
increasing 

the 
temperature 
of 

its core to billions of 
degrees. 
The 
outer 

layers of the expanded 
star 
eventually 

collapse 
in 
on 

themselves, 
producing 

a final, absolutely massive and 
catastrophic 
explosion 
that 

destroys 
the 
star 
completely. 

Things go out with a boom.

The 
Republican 
Party 
has 

permanently chained itself to the 
side of the Make America Great 
Again Space Shuttle™, hurtling our 
country out of earth’s reality.

The GOP decided at its 2016 

national 
convention 
that 
the 

party 
of 
fiscal 
conservatism 

and anti-slavery would now be 
dominated by isolationism and 
ethnonationalism. The party of 
the pragmatic, wise, morally just 
words of Abraham Lincoln would 
now be replaced by the scattershot, 
misinformed, misspelled tweets of 
Donald Trump.

This was a transformation that 

was years in the making. From 
the adoption of Barry Goldwater’s 
radical nationalist positions in 1964 
to President Reagan’s fiscally insane 
“voodoo economics,” irresponsible 
defense spending and military 
misadventures, the party grew to 
include the more fringe right-wing 
ideologies, normalizing them in 
the process. With the acceptance 
of the anti-Obama Tea Party, the 
GOP further incorporated beliefs 
of science denial, xenophobia, blind 
nationalism and a tribal mentality 
that has a pathological hatred of 
the U.S. government.

Yet as E.J. Dionne says in 

his book, “Why the Right Went 
Wrong,” 
“no 
conservative 

administration — not Nixon, not 
Reagan, not the two Bushes — 
could live up to the rhetoric rooted 
in the Goldwater movement that 
began to reshape American politics 
fifty years ago.”

Now, 
the 
consequences 
of 

elevating right-wing extremism 
to 
normal 
political 
discourse 

have finally come to head. The 
effects of the new Tea Party’s 
Freedom Caucus in Congress, 
and the constant commentary 
of furious conservative pundits, 
who, through cable news and talk 
radio peddled pure nonsense of 

the evils of Democrats and Obama, 
leveled a further validation and 
embracement of factually inept 
beliefs. Millions truly believed the 

Democrats were going 
to 
establish 
death 

panels, 
take 
away 

all of our guns and 
transform the country 
into a “neo-socialist 
Europe.”

This 
dramatically 

culminated 
in 
the 

election of the physical 
manifestation 
of 

an 
angry 
Facebook 

comment, 
President 

Trump. His emergence 

was 
condemned 
as 

racist, xenophobic and not true to 
conservative values. The “Never 
Trump” movement desperately 
tried to reign in his campaign that 
had infected the party — or as 
our secretary for the Department 
of Energy, also known as man 
who wanted to eliminate the 
Department of Energy, Rick Perry 
said, Trump’s candidacy was a 
“cancer on conservatism.”

Yet this cancer had metastasized 

and infected the members of 
the party who decided to place 
power ahead of country. They 
nominated Trump and adopted 
his ludicrous platform, heading 
toward an election they believed 
they would lose. And when the 
Access Hollywood tape emerged 
in which the nominee of the 
party of traditional family values 
bragged about sexually assaulting 
women, many political pundits 
began discussing the death of the 
GOP — that this bubble of insanity 
had grown to its limit with the 
doomed candidacy of Trump.

While many Republicans began 

jumping ship and preparing to 
rebuild their party — the world 
was stunned by Trump’s “massive” 
electoral college victory. Suddenly, 
these 
spineless 
Republican 

politicians immediately flipped 
their condemnations and came 
scurrying back, blinded by the 
thoughts of pursuing their own 
personal agendas.

Cue 
Speaker 
Paul 
“This 

is 
not 
conservatism” 
Ryan, 

who pathetically defends the 
administration’s insane proposal 
for an ineffective $14 billion 
border wall, all in the hopes of also 
fulfilling his nighttime fantasies of 
slashing upper marginal tax rates.

Cue Senate Majority leader 

Mitch “I’m not a fan of the daily 
tweets” McConnell, who, despite 
getting screamed at during his 
town hall events, plans his total 
dismantlement of Obamacare.

And cue the countless other 

Republicans who condemned the 
lunacy of the xenophobic, racist 

and ignorant Trump campaign, 
only to defend and cozy up to the 
new administration like pathetic 
dogs. From Rep. Jason “can’t 
look his daughter in the eye if he 
votes for Trump,” Chaffetz, to 
Senator Marco “Donald Trump 
is a con artist, Donald Trump 
will never be the nominee of the 
party of Lincoln,” Rubio — these 
congressmen, senators, pundits, 
all now have capitulated to the 
monster they helped create that is 
Donald Trump’s GOP. 

And now, chained to this 

administration, the GOP is a 
bubble growing ever larger — 
a star becoming all the more 
unstable. The problems that the 
nomination of Trump exemplified 
have been swept beneath the rug 
by a smiling Paul Ryan and a 
sweating Reince Priebus.

And 
the 
ever-increasing 

temperatures 
seen 
before 
a 

supernova in the death of a star 
mirror the inner chaos within the 
Trump administration and the 
defense mounted by the GOP. In 
one month the 45th president of 
the United States has managed to 
attempt an unconstitutional travel 
ban, dismissed federal “so-called 
judges,” called the press the enemy 
of people, appointed a right-wing 
political hack as a permanent 
member of the NSC and had to 
force the resignation of his national 
security adviser because of an 
ongoing scandal. 

And as Reince Priebus, Sean 

Spicer and the GOP dance in 
goddamn circles attempting to put 
out these endless fires, a dotty old 
racist continues to wander around 
the White House in a bathrobe, 
tweeting about his crowd sizes 
and “The Celebrity Apprentice” 
— allowing his sycophant white 
nationalist advisers, such as Steve 
Bannon and Stephen Miller, to 
draft ludicrous executive orders 
further engulfing the GOP in a 
fiery hell.

This is what happens when 

you 
normalize 
such 
fringe 

movements of ethnonationalism. 
This is what happens when a 
reality TV celebrity capitalizes on 
free media and your party lacks 
the constitution to dismiss his 
populist rhetoric.

This is a bubble that was 

supposed to pop in November — a 
star destined to explode with the 
defeat of Trump — that now, is 
growing ever hotter, its stability 
becoming all the weaker.

This is something that will go 

“boom.” 

A 

couple weeks ago, I had 
the opportunity to attend 
TedxUofM’s 
annual 

conference 
in 
the 

Power Center, and I 
was struck especially 
by Dr. Abdul El-Sayed’s 
talk. University alum 
El-Sayed, the health 
officer and executive 
director of the Detroit 
Health 
Department, 

told 
the 
crowded 

audience 
to 
“think 

upstream” 
when 

considering issues of 
poverty and public health.

It’s true that poverty and poor 

health go hand-in-hand, but the 
story is bigger than that. It is 
not a simple cause-and-effect 
relationship 
between 
poverty 

and poor health; rather, there are 
several underlying factors that 
cause and sustain poverty, and 
poverty itself has several effects 
that cause poor health.

Removed as many of us are 

from poverty, most University 
of Michigan students are at least 
aware of it as a problem. However, 
the problems of food scarcity and 
lack of health education in America 
seem even further removed from 
our privilege. It can be difficult 
to believe that there are people in 
the United States — a developed 
country — who do not have 
access to a basic human need: 
healthy sustenance.

However, these problems are 

closer than we think. A USDA 
“food desert” is defined as “a 
low-income census tract where 
either a substantial number or 
share of residents has low access 
to a supermarket or large grocery 
store,” and a map of food deserts 
in America shows a startlingly 
large amount across the country. 
Though they are more prevalent 
in the rural South, there is a food 
desert not less than an hour away 
in our very own Detroit.

There are several factors that 

culminated into Detroit being a 
food desert. Built by carmakers, 
Detroit is a large city with 
highways in and out of the city, but 
not a lot of public transportation 
for those living within the city. 

So, while many Detroiters may 
realize that they should be eating 
healthier, the grocery store is so 

far away and only 
about 40 percent of 
people in Detroit have 
regular access to a car. 
Systematic racism in 
the last century has 
concentrated 
people 

of low income and 
minorities in certain 
areas 
in 
Detroit 

where 
the 
crime 

rate 
is 
especially 

high. So, while many 

Detroiters may want to take a walk 
around the block for exercise, the 
neighborhood isn’t exactly the 
safest to stroll around at night.

For people in poverty in food 

deserts, being healthy is not a 
choice like it is for many of us. For 
example, if I have poor health, 
it’s because I didn’t visit the salad 
bar in the dining hall, or I was 
too lazy to cross the street to 
get to the NCRB. However, for 
those who are not as fortunate, 
poor health is a condition they’re 
forced into by their environment 
and circumstances.

It is easy to judge people of low 

income as lazy, not hardworking 
and unhealthy, to tell them to pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps 
and dig their way out of poverty. 
However, that is easier said than 
done, because the poverty they 
are in right now will keep them 
in poverty. The unhealthy diet 
maintained by a low income 
leads to poor health that could 
eventually lead to serious health 
problems and a stay in the hospital. 
Even with the Affordable Care Act, 
health care carries a hefty price tag 
that is a heavy burden for people 
who already struggle financially. 
Unable to work and having their 
savings zapped by hospital bills, 
people in poverty cannot “pull 
themselves up by the bootstraps,” 
because they are caught in the 
vicious negative feedback loop of 
poverty and poor health.

However, the cycle can be 

stopped. The theme of this 
year’s TedxUofM conference 
was “Dreamers and Disruptors,” 
which 
certainly 
encapsulates 

El-Sayed: He works to disrupt 
the current cycle of poor health 
and poverty and he dreams of a 
healthier Detroit. Public health 
policy has failed poor people in 
Detroit, but El-Sayed’s work with 
the Detroit Health System is all 
about stopping the vicious cycle 
that has forced people into poverty, 
so they have a chance to be healthy. 
A few projects in Detroit have 
sprung up as a result of his work, 
including Sister Friends, which 
mentors pregnant teens through 
pregnancy and childcare, and a 
partnership with Vision to Learn, 
which offers free eye exams and 
glasses to students in Detroit. 
These programs strive to break the 
cycle of poverty and poor health 
that wracks people of low income 
in Detroit.

In 
the 
meantime, 
it 
is 

important to learn about the 
importance of public health and 
erase stigmas of poverty. It is 
so easy to judge people stuck 
in poverty without realizing 
the extent of their situation 
— a situation that leads to 
poor 
health 
and 
minimizes 

the chances of upward social 
mobility. Instead of shaming 
those with low income, we must 
strive to understand the whole 
extent of their situation and be 
cognizant of the uncontrollable 
circumstances that have trapped 
them 
where 
they 
are. 
We 

must empathize and withhold 
judgment, because there are 
extenuating circumstances that 
we do not understand.

With 
the 
fate 
of 
the 

Affordable Care Act in the air, 
it is more important than ever 
to realize that while the law did 
have its flaws, accessible health 
care is a lifeline for people with 
low income, who are trapped 
in this awful feedback cycle of 
poverty and poor health.

I

n a psychopathology class 
I am currently enrolled 
in, 
discussion 
on 
the 

manifestation of stress 
arose, as stress is a 
prominent 
factor 
in 

mental illness. While in 
many stress is apparent 
and noticeable to its 
possessor, there are 
documented cases in 
which stress manifests 
itself 
physically, 

through twitches or 
tics, or even in partial 
blindness. 
While 

incredibly 
rare, 
this 
disorder 

(conversion 
disorder) 
was 

particularly interesting to me, as 
I was reminded of my own high 
school experience. 

In the classic, over-achieving, 

well-rounded, doing-this-for-my-
college-application fashion, I was 
involved in as many aspects of 
high school as I could potentially 
fit within 24 hours. I would often 
wake up early to go to meetings 
before school, and I would rarely 
return home from school until 8 or 
9 p.m. My days were busy and filled 
with stress, but if ever I were asked 
about my own well-being I would 
respond positively, confirming my 
own happiness and mental health. 
Importantly, I believed it. I never 
thought much of the constant 
stressors in my life, and I enjoyed 
being busy. This raised a very 
important question for me: Why 
was I striving in spite of all of this 
stress, while many of my friends 
and peers were not?

Stress is huge in college students, 

and majorly affects one’s mental 
health. This can be explained in 
any number of ways, though the 
exact etiology of stress in college 
students 
remains 
unknown. 

Particularly at the University of 
Michigan, I have observed stress-
perpetuating behaviors such as 
stress competition and rumination, 
which many of us are unlikely 
to even be aware of, or perhaps 
perpetuate ourselves. I hope that 
if we notice and acknowledge how 
problematic these actions are, 
we can perhaps decrease their 
prevalence on our campus and 
subsequently decrease our stress 

levels through self-awareness.

I am a relatively relaxed person 

when it comes to assignments 

and exams. I was 
lucky to be raised 
by a teacher who 
somehow 
managed 

to 
simultaneously 

promote 
both 
the 

importance of doing 
well in school and 
the 
importance 
of 

maintaining a healthy 
level of stress. My high 
school was not very 
competitive outside of 

the cohort of students who took the 
same AP classes and participated 
in 
the 
same 
extracurricular 

activities, so like most freshmen, 
my experience at the University 
my freshman year was incredibly 
different from my experiences in 
high school.

What startled me most about 

the transition was not the rigor of 
the course exams, or the number 
of readings I was assigned per 
week, but rather other students’ 
responses to these expectations. 
Though I was completely without 
studying skills or experience with 
vast amounts of homework, I 
adjusted quickly to the rigor and 
though I was overwhelmed, I 
found the transition not to be very 
difficult. Other students from my 
small, underfunded high school 
who now attend the University 
related similar experiences. I 
was shocked. Friends of mine 
who had attended prestigious, 
rigorous 
high 
schools 
were 

spending hours in the library 
every day, our conversations 
revolved solely around readings, 
classes, professors and incessant, 
constant stress.

I was immediately concerned 

that I wasn’t stressed enough, that 
I was perhaps not putting in the 
requisite number of hours each 
week studying. But as time went 
on, I realized more and more that 
the excessive stress my peers were 
experiencing was hurting them 
more than it was helping. I think 
the phenomenon of “unnecessary 
stress” demonstrated by many 
students at this university can be 
explained through a variety of 

social cues and norms, and if we 
become aware of these, we can 
perhaps end the vicious cycle of 
their perpetuation.

Studying has become more of a 

social activity than an individual 
activity, and this often leads to 
distractions. 
While 
studying 

with friends can be beneficial 
when the studying is low-stakes, 
group study puts students at risk 
for distractions and decreased 
productivity. 
What’s 
more, 

studying in public or with friends 
can be a double-edged sword. For 
some, being around friends can lead 
to increased social disruption from 
concentration, while for others 
it can be easier to hold yourself 
accountable for studying when 
you’re among peers. However, it is 
important to differentiate between 
studying and socializing. This 
multitasking of socializing and 
studying diminishes efficiency and 
attention abilities.

Outside of studying and classes, 

when socializing or working, avoid 
topics of school, stress or exams. 
While it is helpful to discuss 
your worries and stressors to a 
degree and in certain situations, 
constant 
discussion 
of 
stress 

logically leads to rumination and 
increased stress. It is not a secret 
that students at this university are 
very competitive. Have you ever 
found yourself in a conversation 
where your friend complains to 
you about their workload, or how 
stressed they are for midterms, 
etc.? Have you ever immediately 
shot back with your own workload 
or stress level in a subconscious 
attempt to one-up them? Stress-
competition can be incredibly 
toxic, and not only leads to 
rumination and increased stress, 
but is also just bad conversation. 
The last thing you need to do when 
you’ve finished studying is worry 
about studying more.

The series for dreamers: 
A conversation with Pete 
Holmes and Judd Apatow

“If it sucks, you’re doing it 

right. I think that’s a fun thing to 
share with people.”

This is how Pete Holmes — 

creator of HBO’s latest comedy 
series 
“Crashing” 
— 
replied 

when I asked him to describe the 
central message of his new show. 
Accompanying Holmes during 
our 
conversation 
was 
Judd 

Apatow (“Knocked Up”), one 
of “Crashing” ’s producers and 
the director of two of the series’ 
episodes. The Holmes-created 
and Apatow-produced comedy 
has been widely praised for its 
charismatic cast and clever wit. 
Released on Feb. 19, the series 
currently holds a 92 percent 
“Certified Fresh” rating on the 
popular aggregate site Rotten 
Tomatoes.

Playing a fictionalized version 

of himself as a middling comedian 
recently 
separated 
from 
his 

wife, Holmes’s inspiration for 
“Crashing” 
is 
derived 
from 

his own experiences. Holmes 
divorced his wife in 2007 while 
struggling to progress his comedy 
career into his late-20s. It was at 
this time that Holmes became 
close 
with 
fellow 
comedian 

T.J. Miller (“Deadpool”), who 
features in two of the show’s 
episodes.

“The fun thing about T.J. was 

— when my real wife left me, he 
invited me to come hangout for 
a week in Pittsburgh,” Holmes 
recalled. “We laughed, and had 
a lot of room service… [now] 
when one of us is hurt we’re like 
dolphins [and can sense it].”

Holmes’s 
divorce 
had 
a 

profound effect on his psyche 
and 
drastically 
altered 
his 

perspective on life — he turned 

away from his faith to being 
able to appreciate the mystery 
in everything. This shift freed 
him to address new and different 
topics in his comedic routine, 
Holmes stated.

To fully explore these ideas 

about 
“boners 
and 
stuff,” 

Holmes and Apatow elected to 
do a television series, as opposed 
to a feature-length film. This 
represented a shift in from the 
norm for Apatow who — despite 
possessing a shared background 
with Holmes in stand-up comedy 
and the Los Angeles comedy club 
scene — typically does most of his 
production work on movies.

For 
Holmes, 
he 
decided 

it was a show as soon as the 
premise started to present itself 
as something episodic. While 
not 
his 
traditional 
domain, 

Apatow said he enjoyed the 
change in directing constraints 
due to the freedom offered by 
television that permits deeper 
character explorations. Despite 
the difference in medium, he 
maintained the same approach of 
striving to be funny by working 
with the actors before filming to 
acquire their perspectives on the 
scene and their character.

Applying this same approach to 

“Crashing,” Apatow and Holmes 
worked to develop a distinct style 
for Holmes’ character. When 
asked to compare his character 
on “Crashing” to his actual self, 
Holmes distinguished between 
the two personalities.

“[My character is] like me 

if I was a little bit sweeter and 
more naïve. It was a little bit of 
a vacation [to play that role],” 
Holmes said. “It just helped me 
have a point of reference for any 
scene.”

Although Holmes’s outlook 

changed, he still occasionally 
bombed during his stand-up 

routines.

“I remember doing a show 

with Kumail Nanjiani (“Silicon 
Valley”) that was so bad that I 
smoked a cigarette after the show 
because I wanted part of me to 
die,” he said, recalling one of his 
worst outings.

As 
a 
longtime 
stand-up 

comedian 
himself, 
Apatow 

was able to relate to Holmes’ 
experience, 
echoing 
similar 

thoughts about the effects of 
rough comedic performances on 
comedians.

“A lot of the fun of the show 

is watching someone do stand-
up when they’re not good at it,” 
Apatow said. “[But] if [Holmes’s 
character] keeps trying, he’ll get 
funny enough to make money.”

Due to this frank depiction of 

the stand-up comedy experience, 
“Crashing” was deeply influenced 
by comedian Louis C.K.’s series, 
“Louie,” 
Apatow 
confirmed. 

Apatow went on to explain 
that, when viewing “Louie,” he 
realized that there are only a few 
episodes in the show that truly 
portray the world of stand-up 
comedy. Having a connection to 
“Louie” — a series that has been 
nominated for 22 Primetime 
Emmys — can only be considered 
a positive for “Crashing.”

However, 
“Crashing” 
was 

not constructed solely around 
finding the humor in daily 
struggles. Rather, it is meant to 
resonate with dreamers.

“There’s 
always 
a 
trend 

toward 
people 
having 
big 

dreams,” Apatow stated. “In that 
way I feel people can relate to 
this.”

Holmes 
echoed 
similar 

sentiments about his intentions 
for “Crashing.”

“Hopefully the show will 

give a reference point to anyone 
following a dream,” he said.

Jack White’s Third Man 
Press brings life to vinyl

Two Arts writers recount their experience at White’s new press

On the eve of its opening, Third 

Man Press was a buzzing blur 
of yellow and black, chatter and 
song, excitement and awe. The 
artists, musicians, writers and 
legends of Detroit stepped out of 
the damp cold and into the warm 
world of Jack White — one that 
has the utmost respect for music, 
machinery and the city it calls 
home.

Small but mighty, the record 

store portion of the venue was 
dimly lit and filled with live music. 
There was TMR memorabilia 
alongside classic Detroit, rock and 
other records. That more subdued 
area then funneled down a short 
hallway, past a picture of a young, 
sweaty Iggy Pop and into the main 
event — the vinyl press. Shocking 
was the change in tone, color and 
volume. As would only be fitting, 
rock was blasted through speakers 
and bounced off the shiny factory 
surfaces. Guests mulled about with 
food and drinks, talking about not 
only the décor, but the importance 
of the evening for the record 
industry, Detroit and artists.

The press was vibrant; a bright 

yellow floor and tall, red beams 
drew guests’ eyes to the center 
of the room where workers were 
pressing custom vinyl. Friday 
night’s special: the debut albums 
of The Stooges and The MC5, 
pressed on bright yellow vinyl and 
sold in hand-screened sleeves. 
Sporting Third Man jumpsuits, the 
workers took care to mold, flatten 
and perfect each musical disc; this 
was no automated production. 
White purposefully curated this 
relatively small-scale press not 
only to boost the vinyl industry, but 
to connect and employ Detroiters 
by way of the music that shaped 
their city.

White made note of these 

sentiments in a toast he gave 

towards the end of the evening. 
Surrounded 
by 
his 
family, 

coworkers and attendees, White 
acknowledged those who work 
behind the scenes of music as 
well as the importance of art in a 
broader sense. 

“I also want to thank everybody 

here who works in a pressing 
plant,” White said, “who works on 
mixing and mastering, and every 
musician and artist in this room. 
Third Man Records is about no 
genre, it’s about poetry, it’s about 
painting, it’s about sculptures, it’s 
about music, it’s about history, it’s 
about Detroit, it’s about Nashville, 
it’s about America first and 
foremost.”

Unsurprisingly, this sentiment 

was met with voracious applause; 
there was almost a visible glow of 
hope and inspiration. The night 
served not only as a testament to 
the power that music and Detroit 
had in the past, but to their 
inevitable place in the future of art 
and American life.

Raising 
his 
glass, 
White 

concluded: “We’re all one family, 
we’re all together, and remember 
this 
moment 
because 
we’re 

making things beautiful last for 
the next generation.”

I was forced to repeatedly pinch 

myself on the night of Feb. 24, 
2017 due to the dreamscape that 
became the Third Man Records 
store in Detroit. In celebration of 
the grand opening of the highly 
anticipated record plant at the 
store, Jack White threw a stunning 
private event that was almost too 
good to be true.

Last year, I visited the store as 

a customer and left with a fond 
impression of the interior design 
of the store. Everything is fully 
merchandized from skateboards 
to coffee mugs. It’s layout is also 
littered with seemingly archaic 
machines custom designed in 
TMR’s 
theme: 
a 
mechanized 

puppet “house band,” a device for 
recording yourself and a booth 
to listen to the available vinyl 

before making your purchase. In 
its marriage of aging ideas with 
modernity, the store craftily brings 
unique appeal to the classically 
mundane aesthetic of a record 
store. Yet, the store wasn’t quite 
finished, as the doors to the 
pressing plant remained tightly 
shut. 

I entered through the previously 

closed doorway to an explosively 
colorful plant. Workers manually 
pressed vinyl in the middle of the 
room using machines that were 
custom designed for the plant, 
roped off from walkways and 
tables where guests could circle 
the operation. A screen-printing 
station 
showed 
the 
manual 

application of artwork to the vinyl 
sleeves. The entire presentation 
was vibrant with the working-
class spirit of Detroit.

Vinyl 
is 
the 
quintessential 

form of listening to music — fully 
superior in quality, tangibility 
and, of course, nostalgia. The 
entirety of the event not only 
celebrated the merits of manual 
pressing, but also commemorated 
the importance of vinyl as the 
physical representation of music. 
Towards the end of the evening, 
White himself gave a toast to the 
arts, to “every musician and artist 
in the room.” Embodying the TMR 
mentality, White’s speech praised 
all forms of art, from music to 
poetry to painting. Sticking to his 
word, Detroit artist Danny Brown 
gave a surprise performance later 
in the evening. In White’s beautiful 
testament, he also tied the arts into 
the history of Detroit itself.

Beyond bringing jobs into the 

city, the TMR record plant has 
blended music’s past and present 
by cloaking emotion in surrealism; 
beneath the bright colors and 
intricate designs lies the heart 
of the human connection with 
the tunes that cause our visceral 
reactions — soundwaves worthy of 
being pressed into existence by the 
very hands that enjoy them.

‘I’m Not a Feminist’ poses 
the necessary questions

Jessa Crispin is an author 

and the founder of two liberal 
magazines. Despite the ironic 
title of her 2016 novel “Why I 
Am Not a Feminist,” a spirited 
attack on modern commercial 
feminism, 
Crispin 
herself 

identifies as a feminist. Her 
nonfiction book explains her 
issues with the now popular 
“soft and Disney-ified feminism” 
that 
has 
counterproductive 

effects on the type of feminism 
she wishes to see destroy the 
patriarchy 
and 
change 
the 

world. Crispin starts with the 
general question: Are you a 
feminist? From there, she draws 
on her critiques of modern 
feminism. With her audience 
in the palm of her hand she 
outlines her confident opinions 
on the institutions of the current 
wave of feminism that has every 
female celebrity, young woman 
and modern feminist hooked.

Her critiques run on the 

basis that modern feminism has 
become essentially pointless — 
while it stands on the platform 
that it will become “universal,” 
it forgets that for something 
to become universal it must 
be accepted by all. It must 
essentially be non-threatening 
and ineffective for everyone to 
agree with its values. In order 
for feminism to recruit the 
masses, it needs to be close to the 
status quo — exactly what it does 
not want to do. Crispin argues 
that feminism should not have a 
desire to change the patriarchy 
we live in, but destroy it entirely 
— and reshape the world.

Crispin’s first major problem 

with mainstream feminism is 
the way in which it has gained 
popularity through the United 
States in recent years. “Feminism 
is trending,” she says in the first 
chapter of the book. Throughout 
the following eight chapters, she 
explains exactly how feminism 
has achieved that status. It 
bothers her that feminism has 
become 
“fashionable” 
when 

creating a more equal society 
has 
actually 

become 
more 

unfashionable 
than 
ever. 

Celebrities 
like 

Beyoncé proudly 
don the “feminist” 
label and Crispin 
claims 
she 
has 

every young girl 
calling herself one, as well. 
According to Crispin, so-called 
“feminists” are creating the 
problems within feminism itself.

When 
looking 
back 
to 

the first wave of feminism, 
Crispin argues that women had 
universal wants and desires, 
the right to vote being the one 
on the forefront. With this 
universal desire women were 
able to accept their differences, 
band together and gain this 
right. 
Women 
were 
united 

under a single cause. Today, 
Crispin argues, women have too 
many differences for modern 
feminism to work. Differences 
in race, personal history, class, 
location and education, among 
others, make feminism today 
not an institution that can bind 
women together but one that can 
tear them apart.

“Kill the dominant idea about 

what 
feminism 
is,” 
Crispin 

wrote.

Her novel works because she 

has strong opinions, a strong 
central voice, an idea of exactly 
what she wants and evidence 
to back it up. Crispin faces this 
beast knowing very well that 
society will have contrasting 
opinions — but she also knows 
that there are people who will 
pick up her words and agree 
with them.

In terms of anti-feminist 

literature, 
this 

is 
one 
of 
the 

most 
succinct, 

universal 
and 

sensible critiques 
on 
modern 

feminism. 
It 
justifies 

disagreeing with 
modern feminism 

— 
even 
if 
this 
villainizes 

Crispin to every woman who 
does identify as a modern day 
feminist. The book is worth 
the read for modern feminists 
and 
women 
who 
disagree 

with feminism alike. Simply 
educating oneself on another 
woman’s opinions and ideas 
when it comes to feminism is 
something 
Crispin 
believes 

this society lacks. Whether or 
not you agree with her ideas, 
Crispin’s polemic puts you in the 
position to question your beliefs 
and the effectiveness of the 
second wave of feminism. She 
makes the reader uncomfortable 
and forces them to have a 
conversation with themselves 
about what they believe. It is 
impossible to close the book and 
ignore the central question of 
the text: Are the current goals 
and ideas of feminism likely to 
create the world we search for?

Why I’m proud of my fat, 
bruised punk show lip

DAILY MUSIC COLUMN

The power and meaning in music and the injuries we endure for it

Of course, I know that “I love 

punk rock” is the least punk rock 
thing a person could possibly say, 
but as I left the Magic Stick after 
a sold-out Menzingers show over 
Spring Break, I just had to let out 
that exclamation — as corny as it is.

My friend and I were leaving 

with, between us, two pairs of 
sore feet, a bloody lip, broken 
glasses, sweat-soaked clothes and 
a passionate yearning for a glass of 
water. We thought of all these as 
badges of honor: Proof that we had 
seen a perfect show.

And it was perfect — physically 

draining, 
but 
perfect. 
Myself 

and other Daily writers have 
already 
given 
enough 
full-

throated endorsements of The 
Menzingers, so I’ll spare you too 
much repetition, but these guys 
from Philly are now veterans of 
the American punk circuit, having 
built up a hardcore, loyal fanbase 
and written a full set’s worth of 
great songs.

At the Magic Stick, “Gates” 

sounded like a piece of classic 
American 
songwriting, 
and 

“Casey” brought some of the 
loudest screams I’ve ever heard. 
Meanwhile, the new songs from 
After the Party give you a little 
more room to breathe but still boast 
tightly written, energetic choruses 
and boisterous crowd responses.

That crowd — if I hadn’t seen 

“SOLD OUT” taped to the venue’s 
doors when I walked in, I would 
have known by how packed-
together the entire room was. 
There were a host of different 
crowdsurfers 
for 
every 
song, 

jumping onstage unencumbered 
by security and leading the 

loudest singalongs. It was physical 
but not violent, fans crazed by 
their favorite song jockeyed for 
the closest position to the stage, 
causing harm more out of a lack of 
awareness than any ill intent. I got 
kicked in the face towards the end 
of the show, and although it wasn’t 
my favorite thing at the time, I can’t 
help but smile now when I see the 
mark in the mirror.

I’ve been thinking about that 

bloody lip of mine the past few 
days, and why I’m weirdly so proud 
of it. I’ve never been one to wear 
bruises proudly, like some kind of 
adventurer. I avoid pain as much 
as I can, and if you ever do see me 
sporting a bruise it’s much more 
likely that there’s an embarrassing 
tale of clumsiness behind it rather 
than an exciting story that shines 
a spotlight on my daring and 
athleticism.

Sometimes it’s hard to quantify 

how much a certain artist means 
to you. Collecting all the albums 
doesn’t mean as much in the age of 
Spotify. Discovering all the b-sides 
and obscurities is easier ever since 
Youtube. You could definitely buy 
a t-shirt, or some stickers, or get a 
signed poster. You could even get a 
tattoo. But the struggle of being a 
fan is coming to terms with always 
being an outsider — supporting but 
never really being able to make an 
impact on the art you love so much.

I try not to assign any kind of 

religious significance to music 
fandom, but getting to the front and 
shouting yourself hoarse at a show 
is definitely an act of devotion, 
maybe even a form of worship. 
The way people pack themselves 
in and struggle to get the best spot 
possible, the ways they dance and 
sweat and drain themselves over 
the course of the night — they’re 
giving everything they have to 

the music that they love so much, 
becoming part of the show as they 
trade stability and comfort for that 
life-changing chorus.

To be clear: don’t invade other 

people’s personal space, and please 
don’t use blood as a means of 
measuring loyalty. But just the fact 
that you’re willing to put yourself 
through the physical gauntlet of a 
great punk show speaks volumes 
about your feelings. I fucking 
hate to exercise, but I would have 
burned every calorie in my body as 
long as a band I loved kept playing.

The opener for The Menzingers 

on this tour is Jeff Rosenstock, a 
DIY pop-punker who sounds like 
a cross between Mark Hoppus and 
Father John Misty. Rosenstock 
has broken out since his recent 
release, Worry., yielded indie-
level hits like “Festival Song” 
and “Wave Goodnight to Me,” 
and his set was an exhaustingly 
spectacular celebration of his 
newfound 
success. 
His 
band 

played for a gloriously breakneck 
half hour with an energy level that 
no headliner could pull off without 
collapsing onstage.

A lot of fans had come to see him, 

specifically, as the space in front of 
the stage got almost dangerously 
frenetic as Rosenstock screamed 
out his songs. While Rosenstock 
was exceptionally conscientious 
about making sure his most 
vulnerable fans weren’t crushed, 
he couldn’t hide how touched 
he was by this crowd’s display 
of passion. They weren’t just 
loud, but they were willing to put 
themselves in harm’s way just 
for his art. Out of all those bodies 
flying around this upstairs room 
in Midtown, nobody was literally 
shouting “I love punk rock,” but 
everyone was saying it — to each 
other, and to the artists.

‘I Don’t Feel at Home in 
This World’ brings charm 

NETFLIX

Netflix’s new for-streaming movie “I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore”

The wonderful film “Frances 

Ha,” as described by co-writer and 
star Greta Gerwig, was conceived 
as an amalgamation of everyday 
moments, like deciding whether or 
not to pay a fee to use an ATM. The 
result is a film rich in humanity, a 
measured dissection of an average 
individual as she struggles to 
navigate her newfound adulthood.

Many of those same emotions 

— those familiar beats, not from 
our movie history but from our 
actual history — are given their 
due spotlight in “I Don’t Feel at 
Home in This World Anymore,” 
the debut directorial effort from 
actor Macon Blair (“Green Room”) 
that premiered this January at 
the Sundance Film Festival, won 
its top prize (an honor shared 
by the likes of “Whiplash,” 
“Beasts of the Southern Wild” 
and 
“Precious”), 
then 
was 

unceremoniously dumped onto 
Netflix, its distributor. But the film 
is worth more than its lackluster 
distribution indicates. “I Don’t 
Feel at Home in This World 
Anymore” is a darkly funny and 
gritty action movie, one that 
takes left turn after left turn with 
total confidence — and with great 
payoffs.

If “Portlandia” did “The Big 

Lebowski” 
with 
Phyllis 
and 

Dwight from “The Office,” this 
film would be the outcome. 
Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey, 
“The Intervention”) is the hero 
we neither deserve nor expect 
— a depressed nurse’s assistant 
whose 
house 
is 
burglarized 

and, disturbed by the police’s 
intransigence, 
becomes 
a 

vigilante, obsessed 
with 
restoring 

some 
semblance 

of 
justice 
and 

order in this cruel, 
chaotic 
world. 

Her best friend’s 
husband 
provides 

no assistance, so 
she 
recruits 
the 

help of an off-kilter 
neighbor, 
Tony 

(Elijah 
Wood, 

“The Trust”), who himself has 
no friends and who tries a bit too 
hard in everything he does. The 
guy, after all, is quick to wield his 
pair of nunchucks at the slightest 
provocation.

Though 
Wood 
is 
more 

attention grabbing, it’s Lynskey’s 
performance that buoys the film. 
She’s just so much fun to watch. 
Every sigh slightly tinged with 
disgust, every scrunch of the face 
to digest what idiotic nonsense 
someone else says or does — 
Lynskey is everyone who has ever 
wondered why people truly are 
the worst. But Lynskey never has 
to suck it up or go on about her day. 

She’s the hero in a revenge fantasy 
that feels all the more satisfying 
when she gets her way, often by 
force.

The magic of Blair’s film isn’t 

limited to its two leads. Every 
character, even those whose time 
on screens lasts not five minutes, 
is instantly memorable: An elderly 

secondhand goods 
salesman 
who 

looks on the verge 
of death but can 
still pull off some 
martial 
arts, 
a 

police 
detective 

whose 
divorce-

stricken grief takes 
control of his life, 
a bored housewife 
who 
could 

probably 
recite 

Betty 
Friedan 
by 
heart. 

Cinematographer Larkin Seiple 
recreates his genre-bending skills 
from last year’s surprise summer 
indie hit “Swiss Army Man” to 
form a kinetic style that constantly 
adapts to the film’s quickly 
changing moods.

Blair’s film is not just Ruth’s 

story: 
It’s 
a 
quintessentially 

modern American story — a 
Portlander’s fairy tale and an 
engaging 
slacker 
film 
that’s 

(fortunately for those like myself, 
bored by what one may consider 
the 
artificiality 
of 
Richard 

Linklater’s film) not like “Slacker” 
at all.

in a much better position.

The Wolverines’ Evan Allen 
is playing the best hockey of 
his career in the final weeks 
of his senior season.
» Page 4B

LINCOLN — With just over 

five minutes remaining, senior 
wing Zak Irvin pulled up from 
beyond the arc and nailed a 
3-pointer. Irvin’s shot didn’t 
matter. It put the Wolverines 
up by 30 in a game that had long 
been over. 

But who Irvin received the 

pass from did matter. With 
Irvin’s 
shot, 
senior 
guard 

Derrick Walton Jr. notched the 
15th of his 16 assists on the night, 
breaking 
Michigan’s 
single-

game assist record formerly 
held by Gary Grant.

“Andrew (Dakich) told me 

that I was close,” Walton said. 

“Of course I was looking for 
guys the entire game, but Zak 
said he felt good, and we ran an 
action for him to come up. He 
got an open look, and I smiled, 
and I told him I loved him after.”

Added Irvin: “Aww. I don’t 

hear that too often.”

Behind Walton, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team routed 
Nebraska, 93-57, on Sunday 
night to cap off its regular season 
with a road victory in what was 
a seemingly meaningless game 
prior to tip-off.

After all, the Wolverines’ fate 

had already been decided when 
Iowa defeated Penn State at 
noon and simultaneously locked 
Michigan (10-8 Big Ten, 20-11 
overall) in as the eighth seed in 

the Big Ten Tournament.

Still, the Wolverines had 

been dismal away from Crisler 
Center prior to 
the 
matchup 

with 
the 

Cornhuskers 
(6-12, 
12-18), 

entering 
Pinnacle Bank 
Arena with an 
uninspiring 
2-8 
road 

record.

Sunday 

night 
wasn’t 

a 
chance 
to 

put 
those 

problems entirely to bed, but it 
was certainly an opportunity to 
take a step in the right direction 

before beginning a postseason 
during which an ability to play 
in front of hostile crowds could 

prove 
to 
be 

the difference 
between 
moving on and 
going 
home. 

And to make 
matters worse, 
Michigan was 
tasked 
with 

responding 
from 
a 
gut-

wrenching, 
buzzer-
beater loss to 
Northwestern 

just four days prior.

The Wolverines recovered in 

full.

“I said twice in the locker 

room … that I had no idea how 
we were gonna play tonight,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein. 
“That 
Northwestern 

loss was so disappointing for 
these guys, but they handled it 
like they always handle it. They 
wanted to bounce back. They 
practiced well.

“We had this late game 

Sunday, you have to wait all day. 
… To me it seemed like forever 
when you’ve been through a 
whole season. Then they went 
out, and they were absolutely 
excellent from beginning to 
end.”

A pair of layups by Nebraska’s 

Isaiah Roby and Ed Morrow Jr. 
bookended a stretch in which 

Michigan scored 14 consecutive 
points to claim a 14-4 lead 
within the game’s first five 
minutes. 
The 
Cornhuskers 

weren’t 
helping 
themselves 

either, turning the ball over 
six times during the stretch 
and allowing the Wolverines to 
notch eight points off them.

At first, it wasn’t a matter 

of Michigan’s defense being 
anything exceptional. Nebraska 
still finished the first half 
shooting 56.5 percent from the 
floor, but they were plagued 
by 10 turnovers in the opening 
frame.

LINCOLN — By tip-off Sunday 

night, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team already knew its 
postseason 
fate. 
After 

Iowa’s 
victory 
earlier 
that 

day, 
the 

Wolverines 
knew 
a 

matchup 
with No. 9 
seed Illinois 
awaited them 
in the second round of the Big 
Ten Tournament in Washington 
D.C later this week. 

But before Michigan could 

turn the page on its regular 
season, the Wolverines had one 
last task to attend to — a road 
contest with Nebraska (6-12 Big 
Ten, 12-18 overall) in Pinnacle 
Bank Arena.

While Michigan had more 

games to look forward to, the 
Cornhuskers had nothing to lose. 
In their final game of the season, 
they were playing with house 
money.

The Wolverines had already 

beaten Nebraska, 91-85, at Crisler 
Center in January, but Michigan 
had won just two games on 
the road this season. With the 
stage set for the Cornhuskers 
to play the spoiler — damaging 
Michigan’s NCAA Tournament 
stock — the Wolverines (10-
8, 20-11) did what they were 
expected to do instead, blowing 
out Nebraska, 93-57, on Sunday 
night.

“It’s just a testament to how 

we develop our guys,” said senior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. “We’re 
so battle-ready for each and 
every single adjustment that’s 
thrown at us. Our coaches do a 
great job of putting us in the right 
positions, and it’s all about us at 
that point, just making the right 
plays.”

Throughout 
the 
game, 

Michigan proved that it was 
simply on another level, as the 
Wolverines played their ideal 
roles for the team.

Walton played the maestro, 

orchestrating the offense with 

total command as he finished 
with a game-high 18 points and 
a single-game program-record 
16 assists for his fourth double-
double of the season.

Senior wing Zak Irvin played 

his right-hand man, taking on 
the secondary playmaker role 
to the tune of 15 points with 
three 3-pointers. He topped off 
the night by scoring the bucket 
that clinched his fellow captain 
Walton’s assist record.

Junior 
guard 
Muhammad 

Ali Abdur-Rahkman played the 
energizer, aggressively making 
moves all over the court. His 
13 points were highlighted by a 
stretch of five consecutive points 
in the opening five minutes when 
he slammed home a dunk before 
Walton set him up for an open 3, 
which Abdur-Rahkman hit.

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward 
DJ 
Wilson 
played 

the reliable big men they have 
become, nailing four 3-pointers 
and collecting nine rebounds 
while commanding the paint on 
defense.

Redshirt junior guard Duncan 

Robinson, senior forward Mark 
Donnal and freshman guard 
Xavier Simpson played their key 
bench roles, from Robinson’s 3s 
to Donnal’s relief of a foul-ridden 
Wagner to Simpson’s defensive 
posture.

With the cast of characters 

coming 
together, 
Michigan 

clicked on both offense and 
defense for all 40 minutes. The 
Wolverines shot a blistering 63 
percent from the field and 51.9 
percent from beyond the arc, 
while the Cornhuskers shot just 
41.2 percent and 13.3 percent, 
respectively.

“It gives us a lot of confidence, 

giving us some momentum going 
into our game on Thursday, 
especially how well we shot the 
ball but also just how well we 
played defensively from start to 
finish,” Irvin said. “I mean, that’s 
going to be huge for us to be able 
to make a run in the Big Ten 
Tournament.”

For a team that has been 

both breathtakingly good and 

frustratingly 
bad 
at 
times 

this year, Michigan showed 
that it had come into its own 
down the stretch of the Big 
Ten season. Against Nebraska, 
the Wolverines provided the 
exclamation mark for their 6-3 
second-half record — including 
blowouts over Michigan State 
and Indiana and upsets over 
then-No. 11 Wisconsin and then-
No. 14 Purdue — earning their 
largest margin of victory at 36 
points.

In front of a packed crowd 

eager to celebrate the Senior Day 

of guard Tai Webster, who scored 
a game-high 28 points in the first 
matchup, Michigan sent many 
fans rushing toward the exits 
halfway through the second half.

Despite the large lead the 

Wolverines had, Michigan coach 
John Beilein said he didn’t feel 
comfortable.

“I’m nervous through all these 

games all the way through until 
it’s over,” Beilein said. “... That’s 
the way it is.”

Given 
the 
times 
the 

Wolverines have played down 
to the level of their opposition 

or failed to close out games in 
crunch time, his hesitance made 
sense. But on this night, he had 
no reason to worry.

Michigan dominated Nebraska 

from start to finish, and even 
though the outcome may not 
have impacted their Big Ten 
Tournament seed, the Wolverines 
will 
still 
go 
into 
Thursday 

afternoon rolling because of it.

Wolverines’ thundering road leads back to Illinois
J

ust over a month ago, on 
Feb. 4, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team was in a 

dire position. 

Ahead of 

a home game 
against lowly 
Ohio State 
— which the 
Wolverines 
would go on 
to lose — they 
were sitting 
at 14-8, with 
a 4-5 record 
in a weak Big 
Ten. As it stood, they were in line 
to be the No. 8 seed in the Big 
Ten Tournament and far from 
a safe bet to make the NCAA 
Tournament.

It’s surreal, then, that after a 

month in which the Wolverines 
have been as hot as any team in 
the conference, they still find 
themselves as a No. 8 seed when 
the Big Ten Tournament begins 
this week. They knocked off 
both of the Big Ten’s two best 
teams, scored blowout wins over 
Michigan State and Indiana and 
all but clinched an NCAA bid.

In one sense, that last piece is 

all that truly matters. Michigan’s 
Big Ten Tournament will count 
for little more than seeding, and, 
regardless of their position in 
the conference tournament, the 
Wolverines are playing like an 
entirely different team than they 
were in February.

But there is one aspect of being 

the No. 8 seed that creates an 
irresistible storyline leading up 
to this tournament for Michigan. 
The team it will face, Illinois, 
is due at least partial credit for 
starting the Wolverines’ second-
half run in the first place.

By now, of course, Maverick 

Morgan’s name has become a 
verbal punching bag in Ann Arbor.

When he called the 

Wolverines’ a “white-collar” 
team after the Illini beat 
Michigan, 85-69, in Champaign 
on Jan. 11, it lit a fire. How fitting 
it is that, as the Wolverines now 

look to go on another run — 
this time through a conference 
tournament they seem suddenly 
equipped to navigate — it will 
start with Morgan and the 
Fighting Illini.

Ten days after “the white-

collar game,” Michigan exacted 
revenge by outplaying Illinois 
at Crisler Center. It’s worth 
mentioning, of course, that it 
took some time, even after that 
win, before the Wolverines 
rounded into the form they have 
been in down the stretch. But it 
was still easy to see the different 
mentality they cultivated.

And while back-to-back losses 

to the Spartans and Buckeyes put 
that new mentality in question, 
Michigan has gone 6-2 in the last 
month, with its only two losses 
coming in overtime and on a 
buzzer-beater. The whole way, it 
has looked like a tougher, livelier 
team.

Now, just in time for the 

postseason, the Wolverines will 
get an up-close reminder of what 
sparked that initial flame — and 
how far they’ve come.

Even though the No. 8 vs. No. 

9 game — in which Michigan 
has played each of the last three 
years — is typically considered a 
toss-up, the Wolverines’ recent 

run should have them favored 
over Illinois. They have a senior 
point guard in Derrick Walton 
Jr. who is playing with a graceful 
brand of desperation. They have 
a big man in Moritz Wagner who, 
at any given time, is liable to be 
the best player on the court. And, 
most importantly, they have a 
supporting cast that is willing to 
accept the roles they’ve needed 
to accept in order to experience 
this success.

Consider, for a moment, that 

at the time of the “white-collar” 
comment, Zak Irvin was the 
relatively unquestioned go-to 
guy on the team. Now, Irvin, 

though still a gifted scorer, 
has accepted a secondary role 
as Walton has surged to the 
forefront. Some of this was surely 
not of his choosing — a lengthy 
slump forced other Wolverines 
to step forward — but to watch 
this Irvin after seeing him in 
the early going is to see a player 
increasingly comfortable with 
not dominating the ball.

Off the bench, two players at 

opposite ends of their Michigan 
careers have added punch, too. 
Freshman point guard Xavier 
Simpson has emerged as a viable 
backup or complement to Walton, 
while senior forward Mark 

Donnal has added a handful of 
sublime blocks — the epitome of 
someone rejecting the “white-
collar” label.

Hardly any of this could have 

been said a month ago, when a 
rematch win over Illinois looked 
like it might have been among 
the highlights of the season.

Thursday, the Wolverines 

will get a chance to win a game 
against Illinois that they’re 
expected to win. They’d be wise 
not to forget why that’s the case.

Michigan wraps Spring Break trip with 2-1 finish

After scoring 43 runs in a 5-0 

start to begin its West Coast 
swing, the Michigan baseball 
team found less luck at the plate 
in the Dodgertown Classic in 
Los Angeles. Despite managing 
just seven runs combined against 
UCLA, Southern California and 
San Diego, the Wolverines (9-3) 
took two out of three games in 
the tournament due to dominant 
starting pitching, timely hitting 
and clutch performances from 
their bullpen. 

Rebounding from a 1-0 loss in 

the opening game against UCLA 
(5-5), the Wolverines won the 
next two in solid fashion, beating 
USC, 
4-1, 
on 
Saturday 
and 

defeating San Diego on Sunday, 
3-1. Michigan’s pitchers recorded 
28 strikeouts in the three games 
and allowed only one earned run 
on a solo home run.

Friday night’s contest against 

UCLA was billed as a pitcher’s 
duel, with the Wolverines sending 
their standout left-hander, junior 
Oliver Jaskie, to the mound 
against the Bruins’ ace Griffin 
Canning. The matchup lived up 
to the hype. Jaskie didn’t give 
up a hit until the fourth inning 
and compiled a final line of six 
innings, six strikeouts and three 
hits allowed.

However, Canning was even 

sharper than Jaskie. Coming into 
the game, Canning had recorded 
20 strikeouts and gone 13 innings 
without allowing a run. Against 
the Wolverines’ normally potent 
lineup, he hurled eight more 
scoreless innings and struck out 
12, giving up just three hits. He 
grew sharper as the game went 
along, retiring the last eight 
batters he faced.

The tide seemed to turn in the 

top of the ninth inning, however. 
With Canning having thrown 114 
pitches, UCLA turned to its relief 
pitching. Michigan was able to put 
two runners on base via walks, 
but the Bruins’ bullpen escaped a 

jam by forcing a groundout with 
runners on the corner.

At this point, it appeared 

the 
Wolverines 
had 
gained 

most of the momentum, their 
bats liberated from Canning’s 
dominating spell. But as soon as 
they had gained that momentum, 
it slipped away. UCLA second 
baseman Chase Strumpf drove 
a double into deep left field off 
of freshman left-hander Tommy 
Henry’s first pitch of the ninth 
inning. The following at-bat, left 
fielder Brett Stephens laid down a 
bunt back to Henry, who decided 
to take the high-risk, high-
reward route and tried to get 
the out at third base. But the risk 
proved fatal, as Henry’s throw 
sailed past Lugbauer and pinch-
runner Jake Hirabayashi came 
home with the game’s only run to 
give the Bruins the walk-off win.

“It was a great game that came 

down to the wire,” said senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson. “We 
couldn’t make a play at third 
base, but we have a really gritty 
team and we’re going win a lot of 
games in extra and late innings.”

It appeared that Michigan’s 

bats would have a good chance 
of rebounding against USC (7-4), 
which entered the contest with 
an earned-run average of 6.50, 
and they wasted little time in 
doing so. Senior centerfielder 
Johnny Slater brought home 
sophomore right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann in the second inning 
with a double. The next inning, 
Wenson doubled in a run and 
later crossed the plate himself on 
a USC throwing error.

Meanwhile, 
junior 
right-

hander Ryan Nutof was in control 
from the beginning, striking out 
the side in the first inning and 
retiring the first nine batters he 
faced. Making effective use of 
multiple pitches and attacking all 
areas of the strike zone, he went 
6.1 innings, striking out eight 
while giving up just three hits 
and one run.

“He did a really good job with 

the level of his fastball being 

down, being in, being out, and 
throwing 
his 
curveball 
and 

his changeup,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “I liked his 
body language, his demeanor – 
everything he’s bringing to the 
table mentally and physically.”

USC tacked on its only run 

in the fifth inning with third 
baseman 
Adalberto 
Carrillo’s 

solo shot off of Nutof. But 
Michigan responded right back 
an inning later when sophomore 
designated hitter Nick Poirier 
ripped a liner into right-center 
field. Not content with simply a 
double, Poirier sprinted all the 
way to third base, displaying the 
aggressive baserunning that has 
become one of the Wolverines’ 
hallmarks this season. With two 
outs and Poirier still at third, 
sophomore second baseman Ako 
Thomas flicked a single to right 
field to drive in Poirier and push 
the Wolverines’ lead back to 
three runs.

The Trojans refused to go 

down 
easily, 
but 
Michigan’s 

bullpen was up to the task. 
With two outs in the seventh 
inning and the bases loaded for 
USC, senior right-hander Keith 
Lehmann battled back from a 3-0 
count to record an inning-ending 
strikeout of pinch-hitter John 
Thomas. An inning later, senior 
right-hander Jackson Lamb took 
the mound against the dangerous 
Carrillo with two outs and two 
men on base for the Trojans. 
Lamb came through with a 
strikeout to extinguish the threat 
and then retired the side in the 
ninth inning, sealing the victory 
and earning his second save of 
the season in the process.

“(Lamb) pitches with a lot of 

passion and conviction,” Bakich 
said. “His mindset is a good fit 
for the closer role, and he likes 
being in those situations. He can 
pitch extended if we need him to, 
or he can go into an adrenaline 
situation and get one out if we 
need him to. That’s just being 
an older guy, having experience, 
toughness and grit.”

At first, it looked like Sunday’s 

tournament finale against San 
Diego (6-3) in Dodger Stadium 
would follow a different trend 
from the previous two matchups. 
Michigan struck in the bottom 
of the first inning on a Wenson 
single for an early 1-0 lead, and 
the Toreros got multiple hits off 
of junior left-hander Michael 
Hendrickson in each of the first 
two innings, though they were 
unable to score.

After 
the 
second 
inning, 

however, Hendrickson began to 
dominate, retiring 12 straight 
batters at one point. But with the 
bases empty and two outs in the 
sixth, the Toreros began a rally, 
putting two runners aboard with 
a single and a walk and plating 
the tying run due to a throwing 
error by senior shortstop Michael 
Brdar.

Just as they had against USC, 

though, the Wolverines showed 
their resilience in the bottom 

half of the inning, spearheaded 
again by Poirier, who drew a one-
out walk to set up the bottom of 
the order. Engelmann and Slater 
hit back-to-back singles to drive 
Poirier home, and a wild pitch 
allowed Engelmann to cross the 
plate, giving Michigan all the 
insurance it would need.

“Our guys are fighters,” Bakich 

said. “We want to win every 
inning – if they score one, we want 
to score two, and if they score two, 
we want to score three. There’s no 
question we can take a punch.”

Junior 
right-hander 
Alec 

Rennard entered the game in 
the sixth inning in relief of 
Hendrickson. After walking his 
first batter, Rennard recorded 
a strikeout to end the frame, 
and wouldn’t let another hitter 
reach base until the ninth inning. 
By then, it was too late for the 
Toreros, as Rennard finished off 
the win and picked up his first 
save of the season.

WOMEN’S TRACK
AND FIELD
‘M’ earns 
lackluster 
seventh-
place spot

With 
its 
seventh-place 

finish 
at 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championship this weekend, 
the Michigan women’s track 
and field team produced a 
disappointing 
performance, 

well 
below 
expectations. 

Having won the tournament 
last year, coach James Henry 
was not pleased with his 
team’s result.

“It was nowhere near what 

we were looking for,” Henry 
said.

The Wolverines scored just 

54 points, finishing far behind 
Penn State, which won the 
competition with 96.5 points.

Senior 
Erin 
Finn 
and 

redshirt junior Gina Sereno, 
two of the program’s most 
prolific runners, spearheaded 
the team’s outing of few 
positives. 

Finn won a pair of third-

place finishes in the 5,000-
meter run and the 3,000-meter 
run, after winning both races 
last season.

Sereno, on the other hand, 

was able to give Michigan 
a victory in the individual 
category with her win in 
the 
3,000-meter 
run, 
an 

improvement over her fourth-
place finish in the event last 
season. It was her third Big 
Ten title and her first indoors.

The redshirt junior further 

added to the Wolverines point 
total by setting a career-best 
time in the 5,000-meter run, 
placing sixth.

However, by far Michigan’s 

most 
encouraging 
and 

exciting performance at the 
tournament 
was 
freshman 

Jade Harrison’s fourth-place 
result in the 400-meter run.

The Sunnyvale, Calif., native 

broke two school records over 
the course of the weekend, 
finishing her second run with a 
time of 52.84 seconds. 

“I knew I was going to be 

on the traveling team, but I 
definitely didn’t know that I 
would be doing as well as I am 
doing right now (at the start of 
the season),” Harrison said. 

Despite the few standout 

individual 
performances, 

the Wolverines were clearly 
disappointed 
with 
their 

seventh-place finish.

“It wasn’t Michigan track 

individual, it was Michigan 
women’s track team,” Henry 
said.

Michigan 
will 
need 
to 

quickly evaluate and reflect 
on its performance at the 
Big Ten Championships and 

focus on the upcoming NCAA 
Championships.

Sereno 
and 
Finn 
will 

be competing in the meet 
as 
individuals, 
and 
while 

Harrison failed to qualify in 
the individual category, she is 
expected to compete as part 
of the Wolverines’ distance 
medley relay team, which 
qualified for nationals for the 
15th consecutive year. Senior 
Jamie 
Morrissey, 
junior 

Jaimie Phelan and Sereno will 
also compete as part of the 
DMR team.

Henry said the team needs 

to do the unexpected when it 
competes. The coach praised 
Harrison for being one of 
Michigan’s few runners who 
was able to do that during the 
Big Ten Championship.

“You have to be willing to 

work hard when things do 
not go your way,” Henry said. 
“You have to be willing to take 
bad and make great from it.”

SOFTBALL
MEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
Cartwright breaks 
school record, wins 
title at Big Ten meet

As a team, the Michigan men’s 

track and field finished seventh 
out of 12 teams in the Big Ten 
Indoor 
Championships, 
but 

as individuals, the Wolverines 
put up a handful of impressive 
performances. 

Redshirt 
junior 
Grant 

Cartwright won the weight 
throw event with a school-record 
mark, and while those highlights 
didn’t prevail throughout the 
team, they did provide bright 
spots. 

“(It was) everything that I 

could have ever dreamed of 
happening in a competition,” 
Cartwright said. “It was just an 
incredible feeling. ... Since I’ve 
been 5 years old and doing sports, 
that was probably the favorite 
moment I’ve ever had.” 

Cartwright 
had 
started 

the 
competition 
with 
an 

underwhelming 
performance 

in the shot put — good for 10th 
place — but was 
able to bounce 
back with his 
record-breaking 
performance 
the next day.

In 
addition 

to Cartwright’s 
performance, 
redshirt 
sophomore Joe Ellis finished 
right behind him with a second-
place 
finish 
in 
the 
weight 

throw, ensuring that the two 
Wolverines will compete in the 
NCAA Indoor Championships 
next weekend.

Ellis’ performance in the 

weight throw comes a few 
weeks after he set the program’s 
record in the weight throw of 
22.11 meters, a record which 
Cartwright surpassed with his 
23.219-meter throw in Ohio.

“I suspected some big things, 

but 
who 
would 
have 
ever 

expected (this)?” said Michigan 
coach Jerry Clayton.

Cartwright 
and 
Ellis 

will be joined in the NCAA 
Championships 
by 
fifth-year 

seniors 
Steven 
Bastien 
and 

Ned Willig, giving Michigan 
its largest group of athletes 
competing since 2013.

Other 
solid 
performances 

by the Wolverines included 
sophomore Taylor McLaughlin’s 
sixth-place finish in both the 
400-meter 
and 
200-meter 

races, and a sixth-place mark in 
the 5,000-meter race by junior 
Aaron Baumgarten, who fell less 
than one second short of third 
place.

Despite a handful of good 

individual 
performances 
at 

the Big Ten Championship, 
Michigan 
was 
disappointed 

with its seventh-place finish. 
However, 
Clayton 
was 

encouraged by Cartwright and 
Ellis and stressed a thorough 
reassessment 
of 
the 
team’s 

performances as they prepare for 

the outdoor Pac-
12/Big 
Ten 

Challenge 
in 

three weeks.

For now, the 

Wolverines 
counted 
on 
positive 

chemistry 
between 

the athletes, exemplified by 
Cartwright and Ellis.

“We’re 
literally 
brothers,” 

Cartwright 
said. 
“We 
do 

everything together. Without 
Joe, I don’t know where I’d be as 
an athlete.”

As they turn the page and 

focus on the NCAA Indoor 
Championships, 
Cartwright 

said he’s looking forward to the 
tournament despite the absence 
of many of his teammates and 
hopes to improve on the already-
remarkable feat he accomplished 
over the weekend.

Offensive struggles plague ‘M’

Despite finishing the Judi 

Garman Classic and Spring 
Break 
with 
a 
13-5 
victory 

Saturday 
over 
Long 
Beach 

State, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins didn’t mince words 
when describing her team’s 
performance.

“Our heart is not yet beating 

as one,” Hutchins said. 

Her dissatisfaction centered 

around an offense that remained 
inconsistent 
in 
the 
early 

season. In the first four games 
of the tournament, before the 
blowout win against Long Beach 
State, the Wolverines (12-6-1) 
managed just four runs and 18 
hits combined.

While 
Michigan 
managed 

to win two of those games, the 
struggles hint at a broader trend 
through the first few weekends 
of the season. In eight games 
against ranked opponents, the 
Wolverines have averaged just 
1.9 runs per game, winning just 
two of them.

A dropoff from last year’s 

team, an offensive juggernaut 
that averaged more than seven 
runs per game and finished 
near the top of the national 
rankings 
in 
the 
category, 

seemed inevitable, especially 
given the reliance on young 
talent. But Hutchins believes 
the struggles that plagued her 
team this weekend often stem 
from a mental struggle rather 
than a physical one.

“We’ve got a lot of kids who 

can really swing bats. We have 
some kids that can swing well, 
and when we’re on, we’re all 
on — we’re very contagious,” 
Hutchins said. “And when we’re 
off, we’re all off. So in my mind 
(the struggles) are from the 
neck up. We need to get a little 
bit tougher. We need to get feisty 
and fight. We’re going to have to 
fight for what we want, and to 
be a good offense they’re going 
to have to fight to be a good 
offense.”

Michigan struggled to hit in 

the tournament opener against 

No. 20 Arizona State, scoring 
just two runs, one off a passed 
ball in the bottom of the first 
inning. But that was all the 
help senior right-hander Megan 
Betsa needed.

She turned in one of the best 

performances of her career, 
notching 
a 
complete-game 

shutout and allowing just two 
hits en route to her fourth win 
of the season. Her 16 strikeouts 
matched a career high and 
vaulted her to a tie for first in 
the country in strikeouts on the 
season with 94.

Perhaps most notably, Betsa, 

who has focused on limiting 
walks and pitch counts early 
in the season, 
walked only one 
batter and faced 
a total of just 25 
hitters 
in 
her 

seven innings. 

“I 
think 

she 
has 
been 

consistent 
and she’s been 
efficient,” 
Hutchins 
said. 

“…We just need 
her to do her 
part.”

But after scoring a run on 

an RBI double by sophomore 
catcher Katie Alexander in the 
sixth inning against Arizona 
State, 
the 
Wolverines 
went 

19 innings — spanning three 
different 
games 
— 
without 

scoring, and they could not 
overcome the low output like 
they did against the Sun Devils.

Michigan 
stranded 
10 

runners in a 4-0 loss against No. 
7 UCLA in its Thursday nightcap 
and produced a season-low two 
hits the next day against Baylor. 
Despite a strong outing, another 
Herculean effort for Betsa was 
not in the cards, as she allowed 
a leadoff homer in the top of 
the seventh inning to break the 
scoreless tie. The Bears would 
tally three more runs in the 
inning to win, 4-0.

The next game against Cal 

State Fullerton looked to be 
more of the same, as the two 
teams took a 0-0 stalemate 

into 
the 
fifth 
inning. 
But 

with a runner on in the fifth, 
sophomore 
second 
baseman 

Faith Canfield notched her 
second hit of the day — this 
one a home run over the left-
field fence to end the scoring 
drought at 19 innings. The 
go-ahead homer went down 
as the game-winner, as junior 
right-hander 
Tera 
Blanco 

would team up with Betsa for 
a four-hit shutout and a much-
needed victory.

For Canfield, the home run 

was her fourth on the season, 
passing her season total of three 
last year. And with positive 
takeaways few and far between 

offensively, 
Canfield’s 
newfound power 
could prove to 
be a saving grace 
as 
Michigan 

heads 
toward 

conference play.

“It was nice 

that I was able 
to help the team 
out, 
because 

we did need it,” 
Canfield 
said. 

“But I think we just need to keep 
pushing through it, everyone’s 
going to come around when it’s 
time.”

Added Hutchins: “I think 

they were just relieved, like ‘Oh 
good, we got a run finally.’ It 
was the first run we’d scored in 
about 20 innings. I think we’re 
very tight — our swings are 
tight, our minds are tight and 
that’s why we’re not performing 
to our capability.”

While 
the 
win, 
coupled 

with a 13-run outburst against 
Long Beach State may ease a 
few concerns, it will do little 
to answer the questions about 
offensive performance against 
quality opponents. 

And with the most difficult 

part 
of 
the 
non-conference 

schedule 
behind 
them, 
the 

Wolverines may have to wait 
to settle those worries until it 
matters most, as they might not 
play another ranked opponent 
until the postseason in May.

WRESTLING
Wolverines finish seventh 
at Big Ten Championships

A season that started with 

the Michigan wrestling team 
redshirting three of its best 
athletes began its championship 
swing this weekend.

And as they continued to 

travel with a young squad, 
the 
15th-ranked 
Wolverines 

ended up right in the middle 
of the conference, finishing 
seventh at the Big Ten meet in 
Bloomington. Ohio State won 
the team title.

Michigan’s 
misfortune 

dates back to last fall, when 
the program announced that 
senior 
All-American 
Adam 

Coon, junior All-American Alec 
Pantaleo and senior Big Ten 
champion Domenic Abounader 
would miss the season with 
injuries and redshirt.

The absences of three top 

talents spoiled the Wolverines’ 
depth that could have carried 
them to their first Big Ten 
title since 1973, but Michigan 
managed with a young lineup 
and 
could 
have 
laid 
the 

foundation for a run next year 
with three of its best back in 
the lineup.

The Wolverines finished the 

regular season at 8-7, 4-5 in 
the nation’s best conference, 
while facing 11 ranked teams. 
And when the Big Ten’s best 
converged this weekend, three 
Michigan redshirt freshmen, 
forced into action by injuries, 
finished in the top three.

“I thought a lot of our 

guys wrestled really hard,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland. “We just don’t have 
the horses right now to be able 
to compete with the top couple 
teams. We finished right in the 
middle, and like I said, there 
were a lot of top teams in the 
country that were here.”

The Wolverines’ best finish 

came from Logan Massa, the 
runner-up in the 165-pound 
class. After earning a first-
round 
bye, 
Massa 
defeated 

Nebraska’s 
Dustin 
Williams 

and then Wisconsin’s No. 3 
seed Isaac Jordan to reach the 
final against No. 1 seed Isaiah 
Martinez.

In the final, Massa, ranked 

second to Martinez in the 
country in his weight class, gave 
up a six-point takedown and 
ended up losing by six.

“This time, I kind of went 

out there and got caught off 
the mat,” Massa said. “And 
I was down by six points, 
and that’s a hard deficit to 
overcome in a match against a 
high-level opponent. I learned 
a lot from the match, and I’m 
just going to move forward 
and get ready for (the NCAA 
Championships).”

Another redshirt freshman 

contributor was Myles Amine, 
who came in seeded No. 4 
in the 174-pound class and 
finished third. Amine routed 
Maryland’s Josh Ugalde and 
Iowa’s 
Alex 
Meyer 
before 

losing in the semifinals to Ohio 
State’s Bo Jordan, who won the 
championship.

“After that match, I had to 

realize that I’m right up there, 
and I had a bad match, so I 
had to shake it off and come 
back today and finish strong,” 
Amine said. “And that’s kind of 
the mindset I went into the day 
with. I had a couple minutes to 
mope about that, but this sport 
is too tough to feel sorry for 
yourself.”

With that mindset, Amine 

bounced back to win the third-
place match against Illinois’ 
No. 3 seed Zach Brunson by 
technical fall.

Despite 
the 
seventh-

place team finish, several of 
Michigan’s wrestlers finished 
better 
than 
their 
seeding 

position but still lost to higher 
competition. In the 133-pound 
class, redshirt freshman Stevan 
Micic lost a 6-5 decision to Ohio 
State’s undefeated No. 1 seed 
Nathan Tomasello. He, too, 
recovered to beat an Illinois 
wrestler seeded higher than 
him, Zane Richards, in the 
third-place match.

‘M’ loses in Big Ten quarterfinals

When the Michigan women’s 

basketball 
team 
last 
met 

Michigan State back on Feb. 
19, 
the 

Wolverines 
suffered 
an 
86-68 

defeat, junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty 
scored 
just 
four 

points and they shot a mere 17.6 
percent from 3-point range.

Though Flaherty managed 

18 points and Michigan sank 
33 percent of its shots from 
behind the arc Friday, those 
improvements 
were 
not 

enough, as the Spartans came 
out on top of the Wolverines, 
74-64. Michigan State’s bench 
outscored Michigan’s, 22-5, in 
the process.

“We got good looks, but 

we didn’t make them,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “It was a case where 
we weren’t really scoring the 
basketball, and then we weren’t 
getting stops so we couldn’t 
really get anything easy in 
transition either.”

Despite once again coming 

up short against the Spartans, 
the Wolverines did not go down 
without a fight.

With five minutes to go in 

the fourth quarter, Michigan 
State held a commanding 68-51 
lead and looked to be running 
away with the contest. After 
trading missed baskets for a 
full 1:40, freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick broke the scoreless 
period 
with 
a 
3-pointer. 

Twenty-five seconds later, she 
forced a turnover and raced 
down the court for a layup to 
pull the Wolverines within 12.

While 
the 
Spartans 
did 

their best to milk the clock, 
Michigan trimmed its deficit to 
nine with just over a minute left 
when sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger 
found 
sophomore 

center Hallie Thome for a 
layup. The Wolverines still had 
faint hope of completing an 
improbable comeback.

But shortly thereafter, Thome 

was called for her fifth foul, 
forcing her to the bench and 
extinguishing whatever chance 
Michigan 
still 
had. 
Thome 

finished Friday’s game with 14 
points and nine rebounds while 
Gondrezick finished with 23 
points.

“I’m 
not 
going 
go 
by 

individual 
performances,” 

Gondrezick said. “I think on 
both ends it’s a team effort. 
We had a game plan and other 
players just stepped up with 
the personnel they had and 
the range with the post players 
knocking in. It’s stuff like that 
that just gives you kind of like 
mental lapses but we just had to 
regroup. I know one thing that 
Coach talked about was that she 
admired the fight in us, and we 
just had to play to the end and 
we just came up short.”

For much of the first half, it 

appeared the Wolverines might 
have been on their way to better 
fortunes against the Spartans.

The 
two 
teams 
found 

themselves 
knotted 
at 
19 

points apiece at the start of the 
second quarter, and neither 
team managed to score for 
the first three minutes of the 
frame. Michigan State forward 
Mardrekia Cook then came 
through with a layup to break 
the deadlock.

Less than 30 seconds later, 

Thome committed her second 
foul, forcing her 
to the bench for 
the remainder of 
the half. At first 
the 
Wolverines 

weathered 
the 

storm 
despite 

Thome’s absence, 
and 
even 
cut 

their deficit to 
one 
behind 
a 

3-point shot from 
Flaherty 
with 

5:30 left in the quarter.

But 
Thome’s 
absence 

eventually proved too much for 
Michigan, as Michigan State 
went on a 9-0 run over the next 
two minutes. Only another pair 

of long-range baskets from 
Flaherty kept the Wolverines at 
a 34-28 deficit at halftime.

“I think we got great looks,” 

Flaherty 
said. 
“We 
missed 

shots. 
Sometimes 
it 
just 

happens. Moving forward, we 

definitely need 
to find a way 
to keep scoring 
when that does 
happen. But I 
think 
we 
got 

great looks and 
we just couldn’t 
knock 
them 

down today.”

The Spartans 

wouldn’t 
keep 

it close for long, 

though, as they opened the third 
stanza with a 7-0 run. The squads 
traded baskets for the majority 
of the quarter until Gondrezick 
and Thome made a pair of short-
range jumpers in the final minute 

to pull Michigan within single 
digits. But eventually, Michigan 
State pulled away.

With 
Michigan’s 
defeat 

Friday 
night, 
it 
will 
now 

have to wait until the NCAA 
Tournament 
selection 
show 

Mar. 13 to learn its postseason 
fate. Though the Wolverines 
will likely be in the NCAA 
Tournament field, their 1-4 
finish to the season will end up 
costing them several seeding 
spots if they are selected.

“I know that they’re going to 

go out fighting and that we are 
going to regroup,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And if we get selected, 
which we still feel like our 
total body of work, which will 
get us selected to the NCAA 
Tournament, it will be the 
first time anyone on our team 
has ever been in the NCAA 
Tournament. So we still have a 
lot to play for.”

Allen finds mojo in final weeks of senior season

The puck slid across the ice, 

bouncing off the boards before 
being corralled by the stick of 
Nolan De Jong. As the senior 
defenseman readied for a shot, 
Evan Allen found himself in 
front of the net between De Jong 
and Minnesota goaltender Eric 
Schierhorn, looking for a chance 
at a deflection.

It was a position that the 

senior forward may have found 
unfamiliar during his time at 
Michigan, in more ways than 
one. Allen could have easily been 
the one to take the shot — after 
all, his trademark characteristic 
as 
a 
player 
has 
been 
his 

shot, powerful and accurate 
throughout his career. He has 
had to work to build the rest of his 
game around that one defining 
trait, and it certainly hasn’t been 
easy: for his first three seasons at 
Michigan — perhaps even earlier 
this year — Allen wouldn’t even 
have been on the ice at all during 
such a high-pressure situation 
with the game against the fifth-
ranked Golden Gophers hanging 
in the balance.

Yet there he was, just outside 

the Golden Gophers’ crease in 
a tie game with just over two 
minutes left in the third period.

Minnesota 
defenseman 

Ryan Collins — all 6-foot-5 and 
220 pounds of him — jostled 
Allen, trying to move him out 
of position. But Allen stayed in 
the thick of things, and when 
De Jong’s shot whistled toward 
him, he reached his stick out 
ever so slightly and deflected it 
past Schierhorn for the game-
winning goal.

Allen’s place in that sequence 

is a testament of his development 
during his final year in Ann 
Arbor. Often confined to the 
bench as a healthy scratch or 
placed upon the fourth line — 
known as the ‘checking line’ 
— Allen spent his days as a bit 

player.

His role was far from the 

expectations placed upon him 
as a recruit. Allen had arrived 
at Michigan as a member of 
a ballyhooed class, an early 
signee alongside players such as 
JT Compher, Tyler Motte and 
Michael Downing.

Initially, it appeared he would 

find success just as quickly 
as his peers. Allen began his 
freshman year playing on the 
same line as Compher and 
Motte, colloquially known as 
the ‘NTDP line’ after all three 
had cut their teeth with the 
United States National Team 
Development 
Program 
just 

down the road from Yost.

His play and production, 

though, lagged behind his two 
linemates, and he would later 

be taken off the line. As the 
years progressed, it seemed 
that nearly everyone else in 
the class besides Allen would 
play larger roles for Michigan. 
Compher 
and 
Motte 
were 

excellent collegiate players who 
formed two-thirds of the most 
dangerous line in all of college 
hockey last year before leaving 
early for the NHL. Forward 
Alex Kile and De Jong became 
captains, with Kile developing 
into an offensive weapon, and 
Downing — who also left for 
the NHL last spring — was a key 
contributor on the blue line.

And through the first half 

of this year, it appeared Allen’s 
final season at Michigan would 
be no different from his first 
three. He played in just 11 of his 
teams’ first 18 games and turned 

in nondescript performances in 
each of them, tallying only one 
total point.

Then, the proverbial light 

turned on. Quite unexpectedly, 
Allen became one of his team’s 
most consistent contributors. 
He has played in every one of 
the 14 games after the winter 
break and has collected six goals 
and five assists in that span, 
averaging close to a point per 
game.

“I think his confidence and 

his maturity (have improved),” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “His preparedness 
to be a Division I player was not 
there when he first got here. 
And it’s here now, finally. So he’s 
got to take advantage of it. He’s 
running out of games.”

Allen no longer plays on 

the fourth line, either. He 
has moved up steadily within 
the lineup, and for Saturday’s 
game, he was placed on the 
first line with Kile and senior 
forward Max Shuart. Allen’s 
late career renaissance has not 
come without a learning curve. 
Pitted against the fifth-ranked 
Golden Gophers’ top line, Allen 
struggled on both ends, failing 
to make a significant impact 
only one night after scoring 
the 
game-winning 
goal. 
As 

Berenson pointed out after the 
game, Allen has yet to capture 
the everyday consistency of 
being a frontline player.

Saturday’s 
shortcomings 

aside, Allen’s second half has 
still played out in a way that 
very few could have imagined. 
This has been his first year 

playing center, and he has had to 
acclimate himself to everything 
the position entails, such as 
playing 
without 
the 
puck, 

taking faceoffs and minding the 
defensive zone.

Berenson mentioned that he 

has seen plenty of players put 
it all together their final years 
to have what he deems ‘miracle 
seasons.’ In Berenson’s mind, 
Allen has not quite had that 
type of year. Instead, Berenson 
has seen glimpses of the player 
he thought he was getting when 
he recruited him so long ago.

That, perhaps, is why the 

situation is so bittersweet for 
both player and coach. Allen has 
just three guaranteed games left: 
a weekend series at Yost next 
weekend against No. 11 Penn 
State, and then at least one game 
in the Big Ten Tournament. 
There will be no opportunity for 
him to completely live up to the 
expectations placed upon him as a 
recruit, to establish the ‘everyday 
consistency’ of a frontline player 
that his coach sought.

Both Berenson and Allen, 

though, have come to terms with 
that. After all, the alternative — 
of Allen’s career ending quietly 
— would have been much worse.

“I think his whole career 

has been coming down to these 
last 
few 
weeks,” 
Berenson 

said on Feb. 24. “He knows it, 
and he’s putting his best foot 
forward. It’s coming together 
for him. He’s always had good 
hands. He’s always had a good 
shot. He’s always been a smart 
player. And now it’s showing 
up, and he’s producing. I’m not 
surprised, but I wish it would’ve 
happened three years ago. But 
good for him.”

Added Allen: “... It is kinda 

disappointing that it took this 
long, but I mean, it could’ve 
never have happened, so at 
least I got the opportunity and 
just gotta make the most out of 
it with however many games I 
have left.”

Senior forward Evan Allen spent the bulk of his Michigan career in a diminished role. But now, as a senior, he has found flashes of the potential he possesses.
