Renovated Bert's
hosts 14th annual
Cafe Shapiro
By JENNIFER LEE
For the Daily
Among bright green and blue
couches and flat screen televi-
sions in the newly renovated
lobby of the Shapiro Undergrad-
uate Library, about 20 students
gathered for a night of poetry and
short story readings.
The 14th-annual Caf6 Shap-
iro event - part of the MLibrary
Spotlight Series - featured 82
LSA students who were nomi-
nated by their professors from
the English department and
Residential College to share their
literary work.
Though Cafe Shapiro has
been in existence for 14 years,
this was the inaugural event for
the new lobby - called Bert's
Study Lounge - which has been
renovated with sleek flat-screen
monitors, colorful couches, mod-
ern lighting and wood paneling.
After five months of remodeling,

the lounge officially opened on
Monday.
The readings at the event var-
ied in topic and format, from a
poem about spending time in
Nichols Arboretum to a short
story told from the perspective
of an animalistic and wolf-like
character.
LSA freshman Weslie Lech-
ner, nominated by her creative
writing teacher, read an excerpt
from her short story "Seen in a
Caf," which explained the rela-
tionship between a woman and
"that friend you were never able
to say 'let's stop being friends'
to."
The event was also the first
opportunity for many of the stu-
dents to read their work to an
audience. For LSA sophomore
Caitlin Kiesel, this was her first
time reading for an audience out-
side of the classroom.
"I was nervous before, but
then realized that I wanted to do
this for fun," Kiesel said. "I love
writing, and this is what I want
to do. I think the audience was
really accepting and helpful."

A church may soon be trans-

if Sigma Phi Epsilon frater-

nity selects the Tappan Avenue
location for its permanent resi-
dence.
The Ann Arbor Planning
Commission recently granted
the fraternity approval to move
into the building that is the
former Memorial Christian
Church - located on Tappan
Avenue and near Delta Delta
Delta sorority house. But a
fraternity representative said
there are many aspects to con-
sider, including the building's

structure and community con-
cerns, before a decision is made.
Jerry Mangona, vice presi-
dent of housing for Sigma Phi
Epsilon's Michigan Alpha

has been looking to establish a
permanent residence on cam-

Daughter of Robert

By CLAIRE HALL
Daily StaffReporter
With one of the nation's
most recognizable surnames
and a long list of humanitarian
efforts, Kerry Kennedy encour-
aged University community
members to get involved in the

fight for human rights yester-
day.
The inaugural speaker of the
Delta Gamma Lectureship in
Values and Ethics at the Uni-
versity, Kennedy, who is the
daughter of former Sen. Rob-
ert F. Kennedy, spoke yester-
day about her work defending
human rights as founder of the
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
Center for Human Rights. Delta
Gamma and the Center for Eth-
ics and Public Life sponsored
the lecture titled "Speak Truth

to Power."
In front of a crowd of about
200 people at the Michigan
League yesterday afternoon,
Kennedy said she became
inspired to fight for human
rights at a young age after hear-
ing friends' experiences with
domestic abuse, AIDS and rape.
Kennedy began her work as
a human rights activist in 1981

'U' working with
city to resolve legal
issues with property
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
The University is facing road-
blocks - literal and figurative
- in the ongoing construction
of the Law School's new South
Hall.
Though the University origi-

-nally anticipated submitting
a final plan for the pedestrian
mall to the Ann Arbor Planning
Commission by the end of 2010,
a plan has yet to be submitted
for approval.
With an estimated budget of
$3 million, the mall would con-
nect the Law School and South
Hall while also providing a pub-
lic right-of-way area similar to
the Diag and Ingalls Mall. Con-
struction on South Hall is slated
to be completed in 2012.
Jim Kosteva, the University's

director of community rela-
tions, said University and city
officials are currently negotiat-
ing construction plans for the
pedestrian mall.
"There is no update regarding
University interests in Monroe
Street," Kosteva said. "The city
and the University are still in
extensive discussions regarding
the utilization of each other's
property from time to time."
If the city approves construc-
tion of the mall, regulation of

CFO of General Motors leaves
amid management changes e

4

Finance Chief Chris
Liddell overlooked
for CEO position
DETROIT (AP) - General
Motors' finance chief is leaving
after being passed over for the
CEO job.
Chris' Liddell, who guided
the company to its first profit-
able year since 2004 and led its
successful publicstock offer-
ing, will step down on April 1
after just15 months atGM. He'll
be replaced by Treasurer Dan
Ammann, a former Wall Street
banker, the company announced
yesterday.
Liddell, the former CFO of
Microsoft Corp., was once con-
sidered a candidate to succeed
Chief Executive Ed Whitacre.
But GM's board instead picked
current Chairman and CEO Dan
Akerson when Whitacre left last
August.
During a hastily arranged
conference call with reporters,

Liddell said he had no job lined
up, but doesn't want to be a chief
financial officer any longer. He
said he achieved his goals of
pulling off GM's IPO, fixing its
accounting problems and get-
ting the company back on sound
financial footing.
Ackerson's appointment as
CEO meant that Liddell, 52, could
wait years before getting the job.
The move is another in a series
of management changes that
started soon after GM emerged
from bankruptcy protection in
July of 2009. The company has
had four CEOs in less than two
years, and it recently changed its
top executives in sales, market-
ing, product development and
engineering.
Shares of GM fell 85 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $31.40 in after-
noon trading yesterday, below
the November initial public offer-
ing price of $33. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 209
points, or 1.7 percent.
Itay Michaeli, auto analyst
with Citi Investment Research,

blamed most of yesterday's stock
drop on the broader market
decline, but said Liddell's depar-
ture would have an impact.
"To see a major management
change just when you thought
there would be no more manage-
ment changes is going to rattle
things a little bit," he said.
In 2009, Liddell said he was
leaving Microsoft with an eye
on taking a higher position, and
Whitacre even told reporters that
Liddell would be a candidate to
replace him. When Akerson got
the job, that led to speculation
that Liddell was unhappy about
being passed over.
Liddell has held the CFO job at
three companies: GM, Microsoft
and International Paper.
He said he has not looked for
another job while at GM, but indi-
cated yesterday that a CEO post
might be in the offing.
"I have a number of interesting
ideas which I have in the back of
my mind, but none of them have
CFO on it," he said during the
conference call.

relations Matsumoto took office
Wednesday after his former boss
suddenly quit over a' political
donations sandal.
"Our geographical proxim-
ity has made our relations very
important but also posed many
problems," Matsumoto told
reporters. "It is important to
establish a solid partnership so
that we can resolve the issues one
by one."
During a phone call with his
Chinese counterpart, Yang Jie-
chi, earlier yesterday, Matsumoto
agreed to cooperate to improve
ties ahead of the 40th anniver-
sary of the 1972 signing of their
peace treaty.
The 51-year-old veteran law-
maker in the ruling Democratic
Party of Japan is seen as more
neutral toward China than his
predecessor.
Yet, Matsumoto noted with
concern China's growing military
presence in the region during an
interview with a small group of
journalists.
China's military spending

has surged in recent years,
including a 12.7 percent hike
announced earlier this month
for this year, the latest in dou-
ble-digit increases. Its rapidly
improving military capabilities
have been coupled with a more
assertive stance on disputed
islands, such as the ones in
the East China Sea - worry-
ing countries throughout the
region.
T etween Japan and
China have been particularly
strained since September when
a Chinese fishing trawler and
Japanese patrol vessels collided
near islands both claim in the
sea.
The dispute has prompted
nationalistic protests in both
countries and led China to post-
pone talks on the joint develop-
ment of undersea natural gas
fields. Beijing also temporar-
ily imposed a de facto ban on
exports to Japan of rare earths,
essential for making high-tech
products.
In the interview, Matsumoto
also urged China to observe
an earlier agreement to jointly
develop undersea gas deposits in
the East China Sea.
But he added that he and
Yang agreed to "work together
to deepen mutually beneficial
relations, and that includes our
effort to resolve various pend-
ing issues."

New law calls for
changes in state
sex registry list
Manyteenagers cited for having
consensual sex with minors would
no longer be listed on Michigan's
sex offender registry under legis-
lation passed by the state Senate.
A package of bills related to the
offenders' list passed unanimous-
ly yesterday and are headed to the
House.
Offenders would not be listed
for having consensual sex with
partners who were between the
ages of 13 and 16, provided the
offender was not more than four
years older than the victim.
The legislation calls for a peti-
tion process to allow those young
offenders currently on the regis-
try to be taken off if a court deter-
mined the sex was consensual.

State senate rejects
proposal to stop
issuing licenses
The Senate has rejected a
Republican-backed proposal to
stop New Mexico from issuing
driver's licenses to illegal immi-
grants.
The Senate voted 24-17
Wednesday night against a pro-
posal that would have ended the
practice of granting licenses to
foreign nationals without a Social
Security number.
Sen. John Ryan, R-Albuquer-
que, said it's a public safety risk
to issue licenses to those living in
this country illegally. But Demo-
crats said the move was politically
motivated and targeted Mexican
immigrants.
Under a 2003 law, more than
80,000 driver's licenses have gone
to foreign nationals.

tively new initiative that has
been offered for the past two
years, according to Amanda
Peters, associate librarian at the
UGLi. In the past, the library has
hosted diverse events such as a
graphic novel panel of Univer-
sity professors and a talk about
healthy eating in residence halls.
LSA sophomore Christina
Hornback said she was sur-
prised that her professor nomi-
nated her to read at Cafe Shapiro
because she didn't know about
the event, but added that she was
glad she read her story in front of
an audience.
"This was definitely a confi-
dence booster. I think it's really
nice to hear other students'
work too. It's like a community

amongst other writers," Horn-
back said.
Peters said students chosen
for the event should be proud of
their selection.
"It's considered a little bit
of an honor for students to be
nominated by their instructors,"
Peters said.
For LSA senior Mark Knapp,
last night was not the first time
he had shared his work with an
audience. He said his short story
developed from an assignment
he was given last semester for
one of his classes.
"I couldn't stop writing once
I started. I liked where it was
going so I kind of let it grow out
of the assignment," Knapp said.
Knapp, who was the last pre-
senter of the night, said his short
story was about "a neurotic
lady's trouble with letting her
younger brother grow up and

dealing with her own problems
because her parents were killed
by a moose."
Some of the student readers
at the event expressed mixed
feelings about the library's ren-
ovations and the possibility of
holding future readings at the
location.
"A lot of the time I thought
the sound was drowned out. It
was really hard to hear people,"
Knapp said. "A lot of the space
is kind of superfluous anyway -
it's too much."
Kiesel also described the new
space as "a little noisy" but said
she felt that it was an enjoyable
atmosphere for the readings.
Peters said she is excited
about the new space and called
last night's event a "guinea pig"
for future events and programs
that she hopes the new lobby can
accommodate.

KENNEDY
From Page 1
abuses against refuges from El
Salvador. At the time, she said,
she realized she was "in a world
full of Goliaths (and) that there
were a handful of Davids."
Grassroots movements and the
work of individuals are instru-
mental in promoting change in
the fight against greater powers,
Kennedy said.
"If you look back over the last
40 years about the major changes
on human rights and civil rights,
they've all come about because
of that grasping for freedom by
small groups of people," she said.
Kennedy had the opportunity
to interview fellow human rights
activists, including Nobel Laure-
ate and author Elie Wiesel and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for
her book called "Speak Truth to
Power: Human Rights Defenders
Who Are Changing Our World."
Wiesel's and Tutu's philoso-
phies make up two ends of a
spectrum, with Wiesel fighting
against extreme human rights
violations and Tutu maintaining
the idea that "good can triumph
even under the worst of circum-
stances," Kennedy said.
In an interview after the lec-
ture, Kennedy said she feels her
famous last name is an advantage
in her line of work and has helped
her to enact change through
human rights activism.
"The people who are working
on human rights are more likely

to be more open with me more
quickly because it's a name that
they trust, and the government
is more likely to work with us
because they know and admire
my family," she said.
On a recent trip to Cambodia,
Kennedy and her foundation
introduced a course on human
rights into the country's school
system. Kennedy said she also
plans to do work in Haiti, tackle
health care issues in the Gulf
Coast region and document
human rights abuses in Guer-
rero, Mexico. In the near future,
Kennedy will be working to tie
U.S. military aid to human rights
improvements.
John Chamberlin, director of
the University's Center for Eth-
ics in Public Life and a University
professor, said Kennedy became
the top speaker choice for the
event speaker early in the pro-
cess of organizing the lecture
series.
"We (wanted) someone who
actually is doing some good in
the world and someone who
has something to say and some-
one who would be well known,"
Chamberlin said.
University alum Megan
McKeown said in an interview
after the lecture that she was
motivated by Kennedy's speech
and the work she has done.
"It's kind of upsetting to think
that we can't necessarily do all
that we want to, but it's definitely
inspiring," McKeown said. "It
makes me want to get up and try
and fight for something."

may be convicted with a felony
- rather than the usual misde-
meanor charge - for a count of
indecent exposure.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said yesterday that evi-
dence from the investigation
implies that Filipek "indicated
disregard for the consequences
or the rights of others."
The enhanced sentencing
would qualify him as a "sexu-
ally delinquent person," Brown
said, and may put him in prison

for life.
AAPD Lt. Angela Abrams
confirmed Filipek was arrested
Wednesday but said the detec-
tives weren't available for fur-
ther comment at that time.
The arrest was the result of
a three-month investigation,
which involved intensive mea-
sures including surveillance,
accordingto Brown.
Filipek was initially a per-
son of interest in the inves-
tigation at the end of 2010,
according to Brown. But Brown
said he became a suspect in the
case when AAPD officers arrest-
ed him on Jan.14 for prowling in

the Oxford area.
A specific piece of evidence
against Filipek was photos he
took of peoplethrough their win-
dows while they were in their
homes, according to Brown. She
added that she does not know if
the photos depict students.
There are no reports of Fili-
pek coming into physical contact
with other people while lurking
outside residences, Brown said.
"It's difficult to determine if it
might have escalated into other"
behavior, but we're pleasedto get
him off the street and have him
deal with the consequences,"
Brown said.


MALL
From Page 1
the area would be transferred
from the city to the University.
Preliminary negotiations
between the city and the Uni-
versity revealed potential water
main issues with the construc-
tion of a pedestrian mall. The
pending construction would
cut off the water supply to
some city buildings surround-
ing Monroe Street, but the

University has agreed to install
another water main to fix this
potential problem.
Connie Pulcipher, a systems
planner for the city of Ann
Arbor, said the city and Uni-
versity are working to solve the
issues involved with the use of
the property.
"It's mostly discussions
between the city and the Uni-
versity involving the legal issues
right now," Pulcipher said.
Construction on the pedes-
trian mall won't begin until

these issues have been resolved,
Pulcipher said. She added that
she isn't sure how long it will
take for the city and the Univer-
sity to come to an agreement but
said this mutual understanding
must be attained before pro-
ceeding.
"We need to reach some sort
of consensus," Pulcipher said.
"We don't know where the Uni-
versity stands on that, and they
probably don't know where we
stand, and so we're working
together on those issues."

 Dalai Lama to
cease political role
in Tibetan gov't
The Dalai Lama said yesterday
that he will give up his political
role in the Tibetan government-
in-exile and shift that power to
an elected representative, as the
76-year-old Tibetan Buddhist
spiritual leader struggles with
growing worries about who will
succeed him when he dies.
Speaking on the anniversary
of the failed 1959 uprising against
Chinese rule in his Himalayan
homeland that sent him into exile,
the Dalai Lama said the time
had come "to devolve my formal
authority to the elected leader."
While he has long said that he
wants the exile government to
take on some of his powers, yes-
terday's announcement appeared
to mark the beginning of a count-
down. The Dalai Lama said he
would propose amendments to
the exile constitution during the
parliament's next session, which
begins March14 in this Indian hill
town where the exiles are based.

The fraternity is currently
negotiating four contracts at
different properties, Mangona
said. These include the option
to re-sign the lease for the fra-
ternity's current house on the
corner of State Street and Hill
Street.
Mangona added that one of
the main reasons the church is
being considered is that its lay-
out is conducive for a fraternity.
However, he said substantial
modifications would be needed
if Sig Ep chose this location. The
chapter would alter the current
structure to create spaces for
common study areas, a museum
for alumni memorabilia and
computer labs.
"It's not a perfect fit by any
means," Mangona said. "It
would involve a considerable
amount of construction and
adaptive reuse."
Despite potential renova-
tions, Mangona said the frater-
nity would attempt to preserve
the historic quality of the
church, which was built in the
late 1800s. In doing so, the exte-
rior of the church would remain
intact, he said.
"The church is a beautiful
historic building," Mangona
said. "Whatever we do ... we
would want to maintain the his-
toric integrity and the architec-

tural character of the church."
He added that the prospect
of transforming a church into
a fraternity house hasn't been
contested in the community.
"Not only (have) there been
no voiced concerns, (but) we've
taken a proactive measure of
contacting some of the lead-
ers in neighboring historic dis-
tricts, and all of them have been
receptive," Mangona said.
. Jane Cooper, president of
the House Corporation of Delta
Delta Delta, has also been work-
ing with Sig Ep to discuss any
logistical concerns regard-
ing the potential move to the
church. Cooper said the collab-
orative effort between Sig Ep
and Delta Delta Delta has been
positive.
"(Sig Ep has) been very good
about working with us and
being aware of our concerns and
(we) are trying to do the same
with them," Cooper said. "We
realize that they need a place
to live and ... there's already a
sorority on the street."
Among the concerns that are
being addressed include noise
issues, which Cooper said is a
common problemwith residenc-
es - not just fraternities - that
house large groups of people on
campus. Cooper added that Sig
Ep's housing group is taking
steps to address these issues in
its planning stages.
"Certainly their house corpo-
ration has been very conscious

of that in the way that they're
planningthe design of the reno-
vation inside," Cooper said.
Mangona reiterated the
importance of working with Tri
Delt throughout the process of
deciding whether to relocate to
the Memorial Christian Church
and resolving any of the soror-
ity's worries about the move.
"We intend to work with the
sorority to find a solution that
respects their concerns and
doesn't inconvenience them in
anyway," Mangona said. "That's
all going to be a part of our
continued deliberation about
whether or not we can even go
forward."
Despite any potential appre-
hensions, Cooper emphasized
the positive aspects of Sig Ep
establishing a residence at the
church.
"They're a good fraternity,"
Cooper said. "They want to be
good neighbors, as we do."
Sean Jackson, vice president
of public relations for the Uni-
versity's Interfraternity Coun-
cil, wrote in an e-mail interview
last night that the IFC supports
Sig Ep in its search for aperma-
nent residence.
"Everyone is always happy
for other chapters that are able
to establish a more permanent
chapter house, as it strengthens
and benefits Greek Life on the
whole," Jackson wrote. "There-
fore, there are no concerns from
the Greek community."

Illinois to become
16th state without
death penalty
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - For
a mother who lost her son to vio-
lence, Illinois' decision to abolish
the death penalty is a betrayal.
But to a father who lost two
daughters and a grandson, it's
simply the Christian thingto do.
And to a man-who was sen-.
tenced to die for a crime he
didn't commit, it's a civilized
step that may inspire other
states to halt executions.
Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's sig-
nature on legislation getting rid
of the death penalty provoked an
extraordinary array of emotions
Wednesday - almost all of them
intense.
A Chicago woman whose
teenage son was gunned down
in 2006 said the killer, who has
never been caught, should not be
allowed to breathe the same air
she breathes.
"I am a Christian. I never
believed in killing nobody else,"
Pam Bosley said, explaining her
change of heart after her son

was shot outside a church. "But
the pain you suffer every single
day, I say take them out."
Charles Simmons knows that
pain. The Peoria resident lost
three relatives in a house fire
that prosecutors say was arson.
But Simmons said his religious
beliefs argue against executing
the killer - plus, he considers
life in prison a harsher punish-
ment.
"He knows he's notcgetting off
easy immons said. "He's not
going to leave us, you know. He's
got to walk every day in jail, eat,
face people in there."
When the abolition law takes
effect July 1, Illinois becomes
the 16th state without a death
penalty.
Most nations, including vir-
tually all of Europe, have aban-
doned the death penalty. Among
the 58 that still use it, accord-
ing to Amnesty International,
are the United States, China,
Thailand, Egypt, Iran, Iraq and
Japan.
Quinn's action capped two
decades of argument and soul-
searching over the possibility
that Illinois would wind up exe-
cuting an innocent person.

Allow group therapy
State needs to allow compassion club gatherings
The Michigan Medical Marihuana Act was passed with 63
percent of the vote in 2008, legalizing the use of medical
marijuana under state law. Though a majority of Michigan
voters approved the ballot initiative, legislators and law enforcement
officials have been trying to supersede the democratic wishes of the
electorate by making the bill confusing and tightening restrictions.

4

Make Tressel lose

The latest of these attempts comes from
Rep. Rick Jones (R-Grand Ledge), who has
introduced legislation which aims to outlaw
marijuana clubs where medicinal marijuana
patients gather. The Michigan Legislature
needs to respect the wishes of the electorate
and stop trying to place undue constraints on
medical marijuana use.
Medical marijuana clubs, often referred
to as compassion clubs, started opening after
medicinal marijuana was legalized in Michi-
gan. The clubs are intended to provide a place
for patients who have certified medical mari-
juana cards to gather for social support. But
since their inception, compassion clubs have
been a source of controversy and a target of
law enforcement. Multiple clubs have been
raided, and club owners as well as patrons
have been arrested.
Jones has said the reason for outlawing
the clubs is to prevent patients from driving
after using marijuana. But this is completely
flawed logic. While the concern is legitimate,
it doesn't provide a sufficient reason to out-
law the clubs entirely. Drinking and driving
is certainly a safety risk and concern, yet no
legislator is pushing to make bars and night-
clubs illegal.
The legislation hinders a citizen's Consti-
tutional right to gather and associate, espe-
cially when that gathering is to use a legal
prescription that is medically beneficial. Not
only is the logic behind the bill inconsis-

tent with standing policies, but it serves as a
witch hunt against medical marijuana users.
If there are concerns about patrons traveling
safely home from compassion clubs, then that
should be addressed, but banning the clubs
entirely is not the solution.
The root of the problem is that Michigan's
medical marijuana law is clouded by unclear
guidelines and regulations. Since the clubs
aren't explicitly mentioned in the law, they
have fallen into a legal "gray area" that has
left them open to raids by police and legal
charges and fines. But the clubs aren't out-
lawed either, and they should be allowed to
keep servicing the medicinal marijuana com-
munity without any interference from law
enforcement.
In order to solve the problem and stop
innocent patients from being arrested for
using a completely legal substance, the state
Legislature needs to clarify its medical mari-
juana laws and make them more transparent,
including retaining the legality of marijuana
clubs that provide an important - and legal -
service to medical marijuana users.
The easiestcwayto make the marijuanalaws
clearer is to completely legalize marijuana.
This would make it simpler for law enforce-
ment and stop users from being wrongly
arrested. In the meantime, the state Legisla-
ture should vote down Jones's misguided and
inconsistent bill in order to protect marijuana
clubs and their innocent patrons.

When it comes to NCAA
violations, the Ohio State
University hardly lacks
experience. Since
2000, the school
has reported 375
violations to the
NCAA. Several of
them have come
from football.
The recent
scandal regard-
ing OSU football ERIC
coach Jim Tres- SZKARLAT
sel's knowledge
of his players'
improper benefits, and his deceit
and mismanagement of the situation
proves what we have always known:
Integrity is not, and will never be,
colored scarlet and gray.
The program at OSU has been
darkened for a long time. Former
OSU football coach Woody Hayes,
known for his results on the field,
was known better for his temper. For
those of us too young to remember,
Hayes - OSU's historical coaching
icon, much like our Bo Schembechler
- was dismissed fromthe university
for punching a student-athlete on
the opposingteamwhen OSU played
Clemson University in the 1978
Gator Bowl.
Hayes was a good coach, prob-
ably with a lot of psychological
problems, but his conduct shows
the type of blood that has histori-
cally run through the veins of OSU.
Earle Bruce was hired as Hayes's
replacement. He was said to have
been Hayes's favorite for the job. But
Bruce followed eight strong seasons
with one poor season, when he went
6-4-1, and OSU dismissed him. In
doing so, the school set a precedent
that has carried through to today:
Buckeyes care about one thing, and
that thing is winning.
Coach John Cooper fared a little
better. He followed multiple Big Ten

championships with consecutive
6-6 and 8-4 seasons, and in spite of
the upward trend, he was released
because of his 2-10-1 record against
us. Talented coaches weren't good
enough for Ohio State. Nothing
short of near-perfection would be
accepted.
At last, OSU found its man. Tres-
sel, like a dark horse rider, came in
and has dominated the Big Ten since
his arrival. As much as I hate to
admit it, he has lost only one game to
Michigan in 10 years. And since that
one loss, he has led OSU to a Big Ten
Championship each year. His abili-
ties on the field are not questionable.
But his ethics off the field cer-
tainly are.
Gordon Gee, president of OSU,
seemed completely to subordinate
the stakes here. Speaking on wheth-
er he'd fire Tressel, he said: "I'mjust
hoping the coach doesn't dismiss
me." In doing so, he basically denies
all wrongdoing on Tressel's part,,
making the miniscule two-game
punishment look like even more
of a joke, if possible. Accept this as
Gee's admission that Jim Tressel,
not Gordon Gee, runs the Ohio State
University.
Michigan rivals still cite the
phrase, "The pride cometh before
the fall," in reference to our football
program. It's no secret that the past
few years for us have been anything
but glorious. Sure, we had a talent-
ed offense for two of three, but not
much else. And yet now it seems that
pride will be Tressel's undoing.
Or at least, it should be. But Tres-
sel seems to be the kingpin of the
shoddy operation that is OSU athlet-
ics. Gee and OSU Athletic Director
Gene Smith don't look much better.
After what many are calling a "slap
on the wrist" to Tressel, some think
that the NCAA ought to be harsh on
OSU and specifically Tressel. Who
could disagree? The coach effective-

ly lied to the NCAA during its inves-
tigation of his players and protected
student-athletes who he knew were
doing improper things. Rather than
being an educator or leader, Tressel
chose the game of football over the
"game of life" that he talks about in
his book, "The Winners Manual: For
the Game of Life."
The Buckeyes
value winning
over integrity.
The Big Ten conference deserves
better leadership and representation
from one of the most storied pro-
grams amongits ranks. Buckeye fans
deserve to be able to say they won
fair andsquare. The student-athletes
of the Buckeye football team deserve
a better educator. We, the arch nem-
eses of all things Ohio State, deserve
a fair game every November. Grant
Freking of OSU's student newspaper
The Lantern recognizes this, and
said Tressel should be fired.
But it's unlikely that will happen.
Gee won't do it. Tressel won't resign.
It would be too ethical for him. No,
Tressel will continue to be the head
of OSU football for another year, at
least. But one thing should be clear
to NCAA football coaches. There is
only one way to undo Tressel, and
only one way to undo the Ohio State
Buckeyes football team. Let this be
a lesson to Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke and all other coaches in
and outside the Big Ten. Make them
pay on the field for their ethics viola-
tions. Make them lose.

Facebook oversharing

AIDA ALl I
Don't turn Libya into Iraq

A girl I went to high school with just went
through a very nasty divorce. I haven't talked
to her since she got married and left - and not
even really since the 8th grade - but I couldn't
help but notice all the dirty details of the
divorce because they were plastered all over
my Facebook newsfeed.
Other than firmly confirming my sus-
picions that she and her now ex-husband
weren't mature enough to get married in the
first place, their divorce is the most recent
example of people posting their dirty laundry
all over Facebook. From nasty statuses tar-
geted at an "anonymous" (but very obvious)
friend, to long rants about all the failings of a
current boyfriend, it seems like Facebook has
become less of a social network and more of a
private journal.
I could detail the break ups and fights of at
least four different couples, and I'm not close
to any of them. And while I do occasionally
partake in some good natured Facebook stalk-
ing, all I had to do to find out aboutthese break
ups was sign into myFacebook account. I don't
remember issues like this when I first got my
Facebook, but maybe the introduction of the
stalker-assisting newsfeed has just made it
more apparent.
Maybe I missed the memo when it suddenly
became acceptable to have huge public fights.
But I think what's really at the heart of these
Facebook fights is a sense of protection from
not having to look the person you are bad-
mouthing in the face. As far as I can tell, it's

still rare and shocking to see people stand on
the street yelling at each other about how she
cheated with an ugly, balding, middle-aged
man, and he never calls when-he says he will
and spends all of his time playing World of
War Craft and is the worst boyfriend in the
world. Facebook, though, is a completely dif-
ferent story.
It's sad that it has to be said, but Facebook
is not your diary. If you hate your boyfriend,
tell him that he's a jerk. Don't tell all 534 of
your not-so-close "friends." If your status
update is a direct message to a specific per-
son then it isn't a status update, it's a public
e-mail. Think of how embarrassing it would
be to send a private e-mail meant for your
girlfriend to your entire address book. That
is what Facebook is - a big "send all" button.
Clearly that concept is completely beyond
comprehension for some people.
While it is usually just annoying and a lit-
tle funny to watch these fights on Facebook,
sometimes people's feelings are really hurt.
It's the foundation of cyber-bullying - people
have more confidence when they don't have to
look someone in the eye. Until people feel they
are responsible for what they say online, dirty
divorces, fights and cyber-bullying are going
to continue to be plastered across the web.
Just remember, everything on the Internet
is public. And we don't want to hear about your
divorce anymore.

One can't think of Iraq today without picturing
dusty soldiers, frightened children and wounded civil-
ians, and it has become difficult to envision this coun-
try in happier times. Iraq was once the center of the
Sumerian civilization - the earliest known civilization
on Earth. It was the birthplace of the first writing sys-
tem and the core of so many empires throughout his-
tory that it has been called the "cradle of civilization."
All this has been forgotten in light of recent circum-
stances and represents a history that Iraq's current
young generation can't even imagine. Watching the
protests in Libya on the news now makes me wonder
what challenges this country will have to face, how its
people will choose to proceed and if the face of this
country will forever be scarred beyond recognition.
The recent protests in the Middle East and North
Africa have been an eye opener for the world, making
us aware of the injustice being done to the people in
those countries. The peaceful protest that began in
Tunisia in December sparked similar uprisings in 16
other countries in the region, and its effects were felt
as far as China. Though these protests received violent
reactions from the governments - especially in Tuni-
sia, Egypt and Libya - the uprising was necessary and
inevitable. People deserve the rights they ask for.
Foreign countries have rightfully decided to step in
and provide any possible support to the people of Libya.
While some countries, including those of the European
Union and Canada, have decided to support Libya in the
form of humanitarian aid, the United States also has
chosen to impose military pressure on Muammar Gad-
hafi, the leader of Libya for 42 years. More than 1,000
U.S. marines were stationed in warships off the coast of
the island of Crete in the Mediterranean as of March 4,
according to The Sacramento Bee. Souda Bay navy base
spokesman Paul Farley explained in an arabnews.com
article that this would give President Barack Obama
"flexibility on a full range of options regarding Libya."
Amid the threat of U.S. military action, the French
government emphasized the importance of humani-
tarian aid over military action. The French are right.
It's important for foreign military to not interfere in
the dealings of Libya and its people. We should offer
help, but only in the way of providing our moral sup-
port, shelter to refugees, medical aid to the injured
and imposing economic sanctions. Foreign military

interference may prompt the emergence of nationalist
groups as the true freedom of the country will again
be questioned. This will increase the struggle of the
people and deter the country's recovery.
After the U.S. invaded Iraq on the pretext of secret
nuclear weaponry, life in Iraq has become difficult.
Granted, it was difficult even during the Iraq-Iran war
and the invasion of Kuwait, but after the U.S. inva-
sion and execution of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein,
the country has never been at peace. Civilian deaths
due to bombings in Iraq have become an everyday phe-
nomenon not worth more than a couple of minutes of
coverage by news channels. Militant groups are a big
cause of the instability in the country, but so is the
prevalence of foreign military power. Iraq is currently
stuck between militants killing anyone in their path
and a foreign army claiming to protect the people, but
instigating these militants at the same time. And this
struggle has come so far that it's not easy to under-
stand what the country would be like without one of
these forces.
While the Iraq invasion and military aid to Libya
may arguably be very different, the outcome of for-
eign intervention in these countries might be quite
similar. Libyans are fighting for themselves, and we
should allow them to do so by themselves. Libya and
its people will undoubtedly face a great struggle if or,
as I believe, when Gadhafi is overthrown. The oppor-
tunity for a fresh start, and the process of launching a
new government is when a country needs to make most
sound decisions and needs to remain decisive and,
most importantly, patient. This is also the time when
nationalism, patriotism and self-reliance emerge as
strong sentiments. A little bit of chaos in the aftermath
of Gadhafi's downfall is inevitable, but foreign military
interference will not be welcomed.
It's important for us to sympathize with the situa-
tion in Libya and understand the consequences of our
actions. As we see Libyans fight for justice from the
comfort of our homes, we should be willing to urge our
government totake steps in the right direction. We are
all witnesses to what the voice of a people can do, and
we should make sure we don't turn yet another nation
into a battlefield.

lights dim,
the curtain Walgreen Drama
rises and it Center, Studio One
begins. In Free
this week-
end's Basement Arts production
of "Reasons to Be Pretty," these
events will happen, but in a very
different order.
"The show starts with an
explosive fight and that sets
the stage for the rest," said Jon
Manganello, a sophomore in the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
and one of the leads in the play.
"As the audience is walking in,
the play has already started. They
will be walking into the theater
and we'll be screaming back-
stage," he said.
Before the play begins, the
character Steph discovers that
her boyfriend Greg thinks she has
an average face. When she con-
fronts him about it, the opening
 fight scene ensues. Throughout
the rest of the production, Greg
and Steph, along with another
couple, explore what it really

means to be attractive.
According to Manganello,
"Reasons to Be Pretty" addresses
issues that people usually ignore.
"It really delves into the ques-
tions we don't want to ask," Man-
ganello said. "Like, how much is
being pretty worth and why is
it so important to be attractive?
We're so quick to make comments
about how people look that we
don't always recognize the conse-
quences of those comments. But
this show does."
Manganello plays the charac-
ter Greg, opposite Steph, played
by MT&D freshman Emily Han-
ley.
"My character is the guy who is
trying to hold everybody together
while everybody's falling apart,"
Manganello said. "I definitely
relate to my role the most, but the
great thing about this play is that
each character is relatable."
Because the themes of "Rea-
sons to Be Pretty" are so univer-
sal, the actors have been able to
easily find connections between
themselves and their roles.
"There are parallels between
the actors and all the characters
- that's what makes this play
so human," Manganello noted.
"None of the characters are per-
feet and everyone's out there
screwing things up," he said.
According to Hanley, the
four-person production is very

demanding.
"The parts ask for alot of range
in human emotion," Hanley said.
"My character, Steph, throws
a frying pan at Greg before the
show starts, so most people think
she's crazy. My goal is to get the
audience to see her side of the
story and believe her."
Manganello also went through
the obstacles the play has had.
"The dialogue is so collo-
quial and honest that it's a chal-
lenge for actors who are used to
plays that are written in ways
that aren't necessarily how we
speak," he said.
Challenges such as these have
brought this already small cast
even closer together.
"We're forced to be in these
high-stakes situations, so it's
almost impossible not to bond,"
he said.
One of the reasons the actors

have become so close offstage
is because of close interactions
onstage as well.
"There are scenes where the
characters are tumultuous and
violent, but others where they're
really loving," Hanley said. "Each
character has just been through
a lot, but despite everything,
they're really in love."
The transparency and honesty
in each character is what Man-
ganello hopes will hit home to
the audience.
"It's exciting when the audience
can walk out of the theater, inter-
nalize what they saw and make
it their own," Manganello said.
"Everybody can relate to this show,
whether they've had experiences
like this or not."

lofty ballads, the leftover band
members deliver music that is
uncomplicated and fun. The char-
acteristic Beatles influence isstill
there, but think more "Revolu-
tion" than "Hey Jude." The result
is an album that is less of a direct
descendant from the British bill-
board commandeers and more of
an estranged relative with a new
groove.
Different Gear, Still Speeding
proves, if nothing else, that Liam
is gifted enough to survive with-
out the tumultuous relationship
that constituted the brothers'
bond (as the title clearly hints).
It's his own brand of prog rock -
the album never approaches the
blockbuster potential that was
unleashed with "Wonderwall"
- but the style is still unique and
engaging. The tempo is quick and
spirited, with a clearer Rolling
Stones rock'n'roll tinge that is
essentially summarized by track
"Beatles and Stones."
Opening track "Four Letter
Word" accentuates carefree play-
fulness through a din of cymbals
and guitars. (Hint: The titular
word is "love.") It fittingly sets
the tone for an ensuing array of
merriment. "The Roller," which
peaked high in European single
charts, contains traces of the
patented Oasis infectiousness
that once constantly hooked the
British Isles. Later on the record,
"The Beat Goes On" veers in a dif-
ferent direction - or perhaps in
a different gear - but shows that
Liam can still make a viable bal-
lad, and that he isn't forced into
a new genre by the absence of

COURTESYOFtBEADY EYE
his songwriter brother. Different
Gear doesn't slow down until this
peaceful but mournful track, giv-
ing it the feeling of a high-speed
car chase that's windipg down to
a serene and somber conclusion.
Though Beady Eye's debut
release doesn't run into any fatal
flaws, that's not to say that it
works top to bottom. For all his
success, Liam occasionally lacks
melodic variation - "Three Ring
Circus" sounds like "The Roller"
retooled - which may lead to the
conclusion that Noel did contrib-
ute to Liam's songwriting talent.
No Noel,
no problem.
Additionally,Different Gear never
gambles past its initial change in
style, which strips it of the oppor-
tunity to achieve the big hits the
band members had grown accus-
tomed to in previous years. But
these problems could be indica-
tive of the difficulty in starting
anew, so it might be best to chalk
them up to a few preliminary
bumps in the road.
Still, Different Gear shows a lot
of promise, and more than sug-
gests the band can make it past
the desertion of Noel Gallagher.
What the listener will ultimate-
ly take away from the album is
charm, and unlike Oasis, it never
takes itself too seriously. Instead
of the typical Beatles vs. Stones
argument, Beady Eye has taken
cues from both bands, crafting an
intricate amalgamation with the
roughness of the Stones and the
precision of the Beatles.

"I'm telling you, it's this big"
Farrelly bros. latest
'Pass' is a major fail

By STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
Deputy Magazine Editor
Ill-conceived and surprisingly
dull, the Farrelly brothers' "Hall
Pass" is the latest blemish on a
resume that
once affirmed
the duo as Hol-
lywood's de Hall Pass
facto deans of
successful slap- At Quality16
stick. and Rave
Owen Wil-
son ("Little NewLine
Fockers") and
Ed Helms doppelganger Jason
Sudeikis ("The Bounty Hunter")
headline as pals Rick and Fred,
respectively, a pair of suburban-
ites disenchanted with their mar-
riages to Maggie (Jenna Fischer,
TV's "The Office") and Grace
(Christina Applegate, "Going the
Distance"). Peeved by their bum-
bling and oversexed spouses, the
wives - in a topsy-turvy effort to
strengthen their relationships by
proving their husbands' sexual
ineptitude - grant Rick and Fred
a "hall pass," a no-consequences
one-week reprieve from mar-
riage.
From there it's a very silly
sprint to get laid, one that pain-
fully sputters through contrived
and sophomoric gags. Giving Wil-
son and Sudeikis carte blanche to
paint the proverbial town red, the
Farrelly brothers fail to deliver
the amusing ride that the prem-
ise promises. It's not that there's
a lack of bawdiness, but the over-
the-top element, offering nothing
refreshing - an unsavory pas-
tiche of marital, ball-and-chain
jokes and scatological humor -
simply flops.

And given the (faint) thematic
similarity, it's difficult not to
shop a comparison to a not-too-
distant flick that re-energized
the no-reigns buddy film, 2009's
much more entertaining "The
Hangover" (and with "Hall Pass"
featuring a portly, bearded coffee
barista as a dingbat supporting
character, the faux-Galifianakis
parallel is also inviting to draw).
Of course, the characters' disil-
lusionment - really, how wild
can one go in the 'burbs of Rhode
Island? - is the crux of the film's
humor. It's the men's misguided
attempts at picking up women at
an Applebees's, and not the film's
zanier moments - like eating pot
brownies on the golf course and
an awkward visit to a racy club -
that might best tickle audiences.
Who signed the
permission slip
for this movie?
What's made previous Farrelly
efforts tolerable are the arresting
oddballs: the cerebrally vacant but
perversely likable Jim Carrey and
Jeff Daniels in "Dumb and Dumb-
er," the stiff, lovesick Ben Stiller in
"There's Something About Mary"
or even the sheepish, lovable-loser
Jack Black in "Shallow Hal.""Hall
Pass" suffers from a lack of these
outliers - blas adults bemoan-
ing, well, adulthood - and fur-
ther seesaws with unbalanced
performances. Wilson especially
underwhelms - lie perhaps too
See HALL PASS, Page 6

The 2005 Tony winner for
Best Play tells the story of
Father Flynn, a priest at St.
Nicholas Church School in the
Bronx during the 1960s. He
comes under the suspicion of
principal Sister Aloysius when
rumors of sexual misconduct
arise between him and one of
the school's young students.
Throughout the play, Aloysius
and her colleague Sister James
grapple with the uncertainty of
their judgments about the situ-
ation.
For his first mainstage pro-
duction for Ann Arbor Civic,
director Matt Martello pro-
posed the idea of staging
"Doubt."
"I really wanted to do
("Doubt") because I saw it
twice on Broadway, and each
time I had a different reaction
as to whether Father Flynn
was guilty or not guilty of the
crime," Martello said. "I think
it's one of the better written
plays of the past 20 years."
Because the play requires so
much thought on the audience's
part, Martello opted to use a
sparse backdrop to draw atten-
tion to the four-person cast and
their actions.
"Ourset is alot more simplis-
tic because I just wanted the
audience to focus on the play
and the words themselves," he
said. "I wanted it to be more of
a 'words show' rather than a big
spectacle."
Those involved in the pro-

Shanley's
'Doubt' won
the 2005 Tony
for Best Play.
"The whole rehearsal process
has been wonderful because
the cast and myself have been
analyzing the script as we go,"
Martello said. "There's a whole
lot of gray."
Martello is confident anyone
who comes to see "Doubt" will
be drawn in by the intellectual
challenges it poses, especiallyto
what he calls the "true theater
enthusiast."
"Very rarely do you have
scripts where every word meant
something and nothing's wast-
ed," Martello said. "And I'm
not speaking in hyperbole at all
when I say that I really feel that
this is as tight a script as I've
ever experienced. I think people
should challenge themselves
and watch it for that reason."
Casher shares Martello's con-
viction that the play has some-
thing to offer every viewer.
"I hope that (those who
attend) find something in the
play that nudges them," she
said. "It seems as if the ques-
tions themselves are proof of
our humanity."

le won one of those naked Then again, while it's Cage's
statues for his perfor- fault that the movie exists, it's
in "Leaving Las Vegas" not really his fault that the movie

screenplay seems like the work
of a disturbed middle school stu-
dent.
Cage's character, dubbed Mil-
ton in a lazy reference to "Para-
dise Lost," escapes from Hell
with a muscle car and a trunk
full of guns. He plans on rescu-
ing an infant from the clutches of
a Satanic cult led by Jonah King
(Billy Burke, "Twilight"), but
first, he gets drunk, shoots some
cops and bangs a cocktail wait-
ress, while Piper, another sexy
waitress (Amber Heard, "Never
Back Down") - who Milton res-
cues from an abusive domestic
relationship - listens in. Mean-
while, the Accountant (William
Fichtner, "Black Hawk Down"),
Hell's snarky bounty hunter,
stays hot on Milton's trail.
Actually, the premise sounds
entertaining - unabashedly

rendously shot mess of a movie,
lacking any trace of cinemat-
ic vision. The line delivery is
corny and unconvincing, grating
against the ear. The car chases
hinted at by the title are simply
wide shots of cars moving - no
cuts, no style, no anger. And with
the exception of the occasional
piece of debris hurled toward
the audience in slo-mo, the 3-D is
nowhere to be seen.
Submerged for the movie's
gruelingly long 104 minute run-
time in this septic tank of medi-
ocrity, audiences' minds will
wander toward the script, which
can't stand up to the scrutiny.
The Satanic story isn't just fan-
tastically stupid, it's full of holes,
which it tries to plug, unsuccess-
fully, by throwing surprise twist
after unbelievable surprise twist
at the audience. When it runs out

this is suddenly something new
for the audience to gawk at.
The film's one bright spot is
Fichtner's disappointingly short
turn as the Accountant. He fits
the mold of carefree badass
much more comfortably than
Cage. Impeccably dressed in
a suit and tie, he slams knives
through skulls with an emo-
tionless halfsmile, tortures the
mortally wounded in a steady
deadpan and, in one of the mov-
ie's funniest scenes, crashes a
tanker full of hydrogen fuel into
a police barricade while hum-
ming "That's the Way (I Like It)"
by KC and the Sunshine Band.
Sadly, his appearances are too
few and far between to counter-
act the tepid nature of the rest
of the movie, or the downward
gravitational pull of Cage's sink-
ing career.

HALL PASS
From Page 5
perfectly nails his role as the
token uncool father, as his
mechanical delivery borders
.on unnerving. Simply put,
the actor is at his best when
exuding the self-assured-
I'm-probably-stoned gait that
scored in "Zoolander" and
"The Royal Tenenbasums."
Fortunately, Sudeikis provides
adequate comic relief as the
clueless sidekick, believably
manifesting the borderline
bitter, average man's man title
bequeathed to Paul Rudd of
late.
Never mind that the titu-
lar "hall pass" desecrates and
trivializes the complexities
of human relationships - as
a gross-out flick, the expecta-
tion for emotional depth might
be misplaced. Even so, there
are fleeting serious moments
and moral epiphanies, but
these are such afterthoughts
that they become largely
unconvincing. The desire
is for belly-busting laughs,
which isn't met. How about a
"Kingpin 2?"

become that much more success-
ful at the Division-I level.
In Sept. 2007, Langlais arrived
in Ann Arbor along with three
other freshmen defensemen -
Scooter VaughanKevinQuickand
Tristin Llewellyn. The incoming
class totaled 12, and with the huge
crop of first-year players came the
obvious uncertainty of who would
play on any given night.
For Chad Langlais, that ques-
tion was answered within his first
season in Ann Arbor.
The line charts go up on the
board prior to any contest for the
Wolverines - 18 players and two
goalies.
During Langlais' initial year
donning the maize and blue
sweater, the uncertainty of not
being one of 20 lessened after
every subsequent game. At the end
of the year, he found himself play-
ing in all 43 games for the Wolver-
ines, registering zero goals and 19
assists to go along with an impres-
sive plus-22 rating.
b Fast forward to today.
In his current senior year, the
former high school standout has
played in every single game for
Michigan since his first contest
against Boston College on Oct. 12,
2007 -165 games to be exact.
While the other three freshmen
defensemen found themselves
being rotated in and out, Langlais
was the lone Wolverine on the
back end who earned a spot in the
lineup every night.
"When the coaches write the
lineup on the board, you don't
even glance, you expect to be
there," Pearson said of Langlais,
following his freshman year.

Through the last two sea-

Berenson saying the two years

ment.
When he asked about his soon-

Pitching staff looks to rebound 'M' takes 22-0 record on the road

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
When the Michigan baseball
team heads down to South Caroli-
na for the Bojangles Baseball Clas-
sic this weekend, it will be making
the trip with an unfamiliar travel-
ing companion: a pair of wins.
For the first time all year, the
Wolverines (2-9) will enter a series
with some on their record, thanks
to a pair of victories over Massa-
chusetts last weekend. They, will
look to add four more against Stony
Brook and Winthrop in the series
that begins Friday.
"The first one's always the hard-
est, so once we go that one out it
kind of gave everyone a little bit
of extra confidence to know that
we can win," redshirt sophomore
right-hander Tyler Mills said.
"There's so much talent on the
team, right now we're just strug-
gling to put it together."
But even with some confidence
and momentum, Michigan could
run into trouble with each team's
ace. Both Winthrop (5-5) and
Stony Brook (3-4) will pitch their
first game of the three-team clas-
sic against Michigan, meaning the
Wolverines will see each team's
No.1 starter.
Tyler Mizenko will get the start

for Winthrop on Friday and junior
Nick Tropeano for Stony Brook on
Saturday. At 2-0 with a 2.50 ERA,
Mizenko boasts a better record
than Tropeano, but Tropeano
could end up being one of the best
pitchers Michigan faces all year.
The right-hander, who struck out
106 batters in 99.2 innings last year,
was named a Preseason All-Amer-
ican after leading Stony Brook to
the Regionals of the College World
Series.
Michigan's success, though,
will mostly depend on its own
pitching. Thus far, the Wolverines
simply have not received enough
productivity out of their starters
to win ballgames. Michigan hurl-
ers average just 3.2 innings and an
alarming 6.70 ERA per start this
season, and injuries to Kolby Wood
and Travis Smith have only made
things worse.
"Right now, the problem we're
having is we're not attacking hit-
ters," Michigan pitching coach
MattWhite said. "Early inthe year,
we've used a bunch of different
starting pitchers. We're trying to
get guys that will step up and give
us innings at the beginning of the,
game."
Mills, who threw Michigan's
only quality startofthe season, will
get the start in the opener against

Winthrop. Mills and freshman
right-hander Alex Lakatos, who
will start Saturday, have been the
only bright spots for the Michigan
pitching staff so far this season.
Atthe other end of the spectrum
is sophomore left-hander Bobby
Brosnahan, who will throw against
Stony Brook on Sunday. The No. 1
starter entering the season, Bros-
nahan has struggled early in both a
starting and relief role.
"He's not hitting his spots very
well, and he's a command pitcher,"
Michigan coach Rich Maloney
said. "I'd be surprised if he doesn't
pick it up here real soon. He's a
competitor."
Sophomore right-hander Kyle
Clark, who has surrendered three
runs inseveninningsofreliefwork,
will gethis first start on Saturday.
The offense, especially the top
half of the lineup, has started to
heat up. Center fielder Patrick
Biondi and shortstop Derek Dennis
combined for a .414 batting aver-
age last weekend, setting the table
for right fielder Michael O'Neill
and first baseman Garret Stephens.
Both O'Neil, who has a hit in every
game this season, and Stephens
have been pleasant surprises for
the Wolverines. The bats are begin-
ningto come alive.
Now it's time for the pitchers.

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
Outscoring its opponents 176-
28 thus far, the No. 6 Michigan
women's softball team hasn't
faced much resistance on its way
to a program-best 22-0 start.
The Wolverines have 27 home
runs, and they've allowed just
two.
They have a team batting aver-
age of .357, and their opponents
are hitting just .165.
And all but five of their wins
have been by four runs or more. -
But Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins, while pleased with her
team's performance, knows her
players still need to improve.
"I want to see us play a little
better defense," Hutchins said.
"I thought we were a little shab-
by around the edges last week. I
want to see us throw some people
out, and I think we've gotten alot
better inthatcategory, but I'd like
to see it show up.
"The other thing I'd like to see
is for (sophomore pitcher Stepha-

ment, pitch-to-pitch softball."
