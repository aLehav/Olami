THE POLITICS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
Years late,
research
rankings to
be released

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson gets tackled at the end of a run late in the first quarter of Michigan's 65-21 win over Bowling Green at Michigan Stadium on
Saturday. Robinson missed the rest of the game with a minor injury to his left knee as a result of the tackle. For more on the game, see SportsMonday, Page1B.

National Research
Council rankings
have shaped colleges'
priorities in past
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Across the country, higher edu-
cation officials are pouring over
copious amounts of data, bracing
for the release of the country's
most respected survey and rank-
ing of Ph.D.
programs later '
this week. - ofg
The .rank-'
ings, which ,
are assembled
by the Nation-
al Research KYLE SWANSON
Council of the KYLE__WANS__
National Acad- Covering the
emies, will be Administration
released pub-
licly on Tuesday at I p.m.. That
release date comes several years
- yes, years - after the rankings
were originally scheduled to be
released. And with a new method-
ology in place, questions remain
about how well the rankings will
be received within the field of
higher education.
In an e-mail interview over

the weekend, University Presi-
dent Emeritus James Duderstadt
said past rankings have carried a
great deal of weight at universities
across the country, and have been
an important factor in determining
universities' priorities.
"Done correctly, they can
very valuable," Duderstadt wrote
of the rankings. "Both the1982 and
1995 rankings influenced Universi-
ty decisions aboutinvestment(and,
in a few cases, disinvestment)."
However, Duderstadt said the
new methodology being used in
the survey means it may be diffi-
cult for institutions to accurately
compare previous rankings to the
new set being released on Tuesday.
"One of the problems with the
new evaluations is that they do
not connect well with the earlier
efforts and hence are unlikely to
provide a useful measure of prog-
ress (or deterioration),"Duderstadt
wrote.
The University has done well in
the past two NRC rankings, with
approximately 80 percent of its
Ph.D. programs rated in the top
25 percent nationally each time.
But, the new criteria could alter
the perceived quality of some pro-
grams.
Among the new criteria,the NRC
has divided quality into three dis-
tinct categories: research impact,

After Tate Forcier lost his
starting job this summer,
Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez told his maligned sig-
nal caller to "stay ready" because
his time as a backup would come.
So when sophomore Denard
Robinson went down with a
minor knee injury in the first
quarter, Forcier was given the
chance to prove very soon after
that that he indeed was ready to
run the Wolverines' offense bet-
ter than he did in the second half
of last season.
And after playing much of the

second half
in the Wol-
verines' 65-21
rout, Forcier
looked just as
poised, just as
accurate and
just as mobile RYAN
as he did at
the beginning KARTJE
of last season
when he led
Michigan to an eerily similar 4-0
start.
The sophomore threw for
110 yards and a touchdown and

became the third FBS quarter-
back since 2004 to finish with a
100-percent completion percent-
age. He literally couldn't do any
better.
And freshman Devin Gard-
ner, who came into the game
before Forcier, impressed as
well, throwing for 85 yards and
a touchdown while running for
another. He did account for the
Wolverines' only three incomple-
tions. Without splitting hairs like
that though, I'd say things went
pretty smoothly under center.
But despite the encouraging

effort, there should be no confu-
sion.
There is no quarterback con-
troversy. There will never be a
quarterback controversy with
Denard Robinson healthy and
still wearing the winged helmet.
After two straight summers of
battles, Michigan fans won't
have to witness one of those for
a while.
In fact, without Shoelace under
center, the Wolverines have no
shot of exceeding preseason
expectations in the Big Ten any

PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP
To better use space, WCC holds
classes in Mason Hall at night A

Washtenaw Comm.
College leased four
classrooms from 'U'
By JEFF WARANIAK
For the Daily
In the first collaboration of its
kind between Washtenaw Com-
munity College and the Univer-
sity of Michigan, WCC is holding
classes on Central Campus this
semester.
WCC is currently leasing four
classrooms in Mason Hall. The
classrooms, which would other-

wise remain empty at night, are
located on the second floor and
are occupied by WCC from 6 to 8
p.m. Monday through Thursday.
Nearly 100 students are enrolled
in the WCC classes on campus.
WCC is offering a variety of
courses including English com-
position, basic statistics and
two psychology sections. Offi-
cials from both schools say WCC
works closely with LSA to pre-
vent any scheduling conflicts
with University classes and to
ensure that the best interests of
both institutions are preserved.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said WCC's classes in

Mason Hall do not interfere with
University course schedules.
"These are classes that don't
conflict with our class offerings
here," Fitzgerald said. "They
don't conflict with the times
when our classrooms are most
in use."
The partnership between the
institutions began in July when
WCC President Larry Whit-
worth approached the Univer-
sity's administration in search
of a convenient location to house
WCC classes.
WCC classrooms have become
more crowded over the last three

Purdue Greeks ban alcohol

Officials within the Greek
system and other student orga-
nizations at Purdue Univer-
sity recently established a ban
on alcohol in fraternities and
sororities, according to an arti-
cle in The Exponent, Purdue's
student newspaper.
An emergency meeting held
by the Interfraternity Council,
the Multicultural Greek Coun-
cil, the Panhellic Association
and the Purdue Cooperative
Council came to the conclu-
sion that it would be in the
best interest of the students'
safety to place a "moratorium"
on alcohol consumption with-
in Greek houses, the article
reported.
According to the article, the
decisionto place the ban on alto-
hol came from a series of unsanc-
tinned functions by various
fraternity and sorority houses.

Police kill man
*after he refuses to
drop handgun
Police in Sterling Heights say
officers fatally shot a 39-year-old
man who refused to put down a
weapon and pointed it at officers.
Lt. Luke Riley tells The Macomb
Daily of Mount Clemens the dead
man was city resident Matthew L.
Moroni.
Riley says Moroni's wife called
police Friday night, saying her hus-
band was suicidal, had been drink-
ing and had cut himself. Moroni
was laid off several months ago.
Police say Moroni's grandfather
" left the house, followed by Moroni,
who was holding a handgun.
Three officers fired about a
dozen shots. They've been placed
on leave while detectives and the
Macomb County prosecutor inves-
tigate.
" Police say there was a large
stock of weapons and ammunition
in the house.
WASHINGTON
Biden's home to get
security upgrade
The vice president's official resi-
dence is getting a security upgrade.
The Washington Examiner
reported yesterday that the Navy
plans to install a 10-foot secu-
rity fence and additional security
checkpoints around Vice President
Joe Biden's residential compound
at the Naval Observatory in north-
west Washington.
The National Capital Planning
Commission has approved the $1.7
million project.
Plans call for about 1,600 feet
of security fence to replace a cable
barrier that separates the residence
from the rest of the Naval Obser-
vatory. They also include two new
guard houses, four new gates and
five new vehicle barriers.
The U.S. Secret Service, which is
payingfor the new guard posts, says
the upgrades are not a response to
any explicit threat to Biden or his
family.

Gunman shoots five
people at college
house party
A Seton Hall University stu-
dent who attended an off-campus
house party at which five people
were shot said the gunman stood
on her back as she lay on the floor
and didn't appear to be target-
ing anyone during the chaos she
described as "hell."
"He was just shooting he had
no intended target," said a text
message from the woman, whose
friend was the only person killed.
The woman spoke yesterday by
BlackBerry instant messenger on
condition of anonymity because
she feared for her safety while the
shooter remained at large. She said
she was too upset to talk over the
phone.
She described the Friday night

party, which lasted into early
Saturday, as a "typical fraternity
party" with at least 100 people at
the privately owned row house.
Students said the shooter was
kicked out of the party when he
refused to pay the cover charge.
The woman said she heard a
fight erupt before the man was
thrown out. Seconds later, she
said, he returned with a hand-
gun and started shooting as chaos
erupted.

quiet anti-war

OHN AMIS/POOL/AP
Bishop Eddie Long, left, prepares to speak at a news conference yesterday at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Long has been accused of luring four young men into sexual relationships.
Ga. pastor vows to fight
sexual abuse allegations

'I'll fight like David
battled Goliath,'
megachurch pastor
says of charges
LITHONIA, Ga. (AP) - Cast-
ing himself as the Bible's ultimate
underdog, Bishop Eddie Long
went before thousands of faith-
ful supporters at his megachurch
yesterday and promised to fight
accusations that he lured four
young men into sexual relation-
ships.
"I feel like David against Goli-
ath. But I got five rocks, and I
haven't thrown one yet," Long
said in his first public remarks
since his accusers filed lawsuits
last week claiming he abused his
"spiritual authority." He stopped
short of denying 'the allegations
but implied he was wronged by
them.
"I have never in my life por-
trayed myself as a perfect man.
But I am not the man that's being
portrayed on the television. That's
not me. That is not me," he said.
Long's brief addresses to the
congregation at New Birth Mis-
sionary Baptist Church were met
with thunderous applause and an
outpouring of support during ser-

vices that were equal parts part
rock concert and pep rally. The
sanctuary was nearly filled to its
10,000-seat capacity for both the
8 a.m. and 11 a.m. services. Many
lined up two hours before the
doors of the church opened.
Long became one of the coun-
try's most powerful indepen-
dent church leaders over the last
20 years, turning a suburban
Atlanta congregation of 150 to
a 25,000-member powerhouse
with a $50 million cathedral
and a roster of parishioners that
includes athletes, entertainers
and politicians. And there was
almost no sign yesterday that his
flock wanted to turn him away.
Followers prayed, sang and
embraced one another as they ral-
lied around their senior pastor.
Wearing a cream-colored suit as
he strode into the church sanctu-
ary hand-in-hand with his wife,
Vanessa, Long paused to soak in
the adoration.
During the second service,
however, one young man in a blue
shirt stood up and shouted: "We
want to know the truth, man!" He
was quickly escorted out and did
not return.
After the service, many
expressed unwavering support
for their leader.
"We know and we love Bishop,"

said Annie Cannon, a seven-year
member of New Birth. "We love
our place of worship. My son goes
to school here. We do everything
here."
It is unclear whether Long
faces any risk of being removed by
his church's board, but the allega-
tions at the very least guarantee
months of scrutiny as the lawsuits
move forward.
Long is a father of four who
has been an outspoken oppo-
nent of gay marriage and whose
church has counseled gay mem-
bers to become straight. Two
young men say he groomed
them for sexual relationships
when they were enrolled in
the church's LongFellows
Youth Academy, a program that
taught teens about sexual and
financial discipline. Two other
young men - one of whom
attended a satellite church in
Charlotte, N.C. - have made
similar claims.
The men say they were 17 or
18 when the relationships began.
Federal and state authorities have
declined to investigate because
Georgia's age of consent is 16.
"I've been accused. I'm under
attack. I want you to know, as
I said earlier, I am not a per-
fect man," Long said. "But this
thing, I'm going to fight."

Remarks come after
FBI raids in anti-war
activist's home
CHICAGO (AP) - FBI agents in
Chicago took a laptop and docu-
ments from the home of a Palestin-
ian-American anti-war activist in
an attempt to silence his advocacy,
an attorney said yesterday.
The FBI on Friday searched
eight addresses in Minneapolis
and Chicago, including the home
of Hatem Abudayyeh, who is the
executive director of the Arab
American Action Network, attor-
ney Jim Fennerty told The Associ-
ated Press.
"The government's trying to
quiet activists," Fennerty said.
"This case is really scary."
More than half a dozen agents
went to Abudayyeh's home on
Friday and took any documents
containing the word "Palestine,"
Fennerty said.
Abudayyeh, a U.S. citizen whose
parent immigrated from Palestine,
wasn't home at the time of the raid
because he was at a hospital with
his mother who is battling liver
cancer, Fennerty said.
A message left for an FBI
spokesman in Chicago wasn't
immediately returned yester-
day. The FBI has declined to give
details on the searches, saying the
agency was investigating criminal
activity not protected by the First
Amendment.
Warrants suggested agents
were looking for links between
anti-war activists and terrorist
groups in Colombia and the Mid-
dle East.
Fennerty said Abudayyeh has
done nothing wrong and doesn't
have any ties to terrorist groups,
including Hamas, the Islamic mili-
tant group thatseized power in the
Gaza Strip in 2007. His name was
also spelled "Hatam" on FBI docu-
ments.
"Hatem wouldn't even touch
Hamas," Fennerty toldAP. "Hatem
is a secular guy, he's not interested
in Hamas."
Abudayyeh, a longtime advo-
cate for immigrant rights, has had
close personal and professional
ties to the Arab American Action
Network for decades. But Fenner-
ty said he did not believe the group
to be the focus of the FBI's inves-
tigation.
Abudayyeh's parents immi-
grated to Chicago in the 1970s
and were instrumental in found-
ing a community center that later
led to the Arab American Action
Network. Abudayyeh joined the
group in 1999 and became execu-
tive director in 2003.
The nonprofit group advocates

for Arabs and new immigrants.
Recently, its focus has been to
combat anti-Arab and anti-Mus-
lim sentiment following the Sept.
11,2001, attacks.
Abudayyeh has not traveled to
Palestine in years, Fennerty said,
but he cares about the region and
has close cultural ties; his wife is
a Palestinian immigrant. In fact,
their courtship and marriage was
the focus of a PBS "New Ameri-
cans" documentary several years
ago. The couple now has a daugh-
ter.
"He's a very caring person,
active in his community and other
communities," Fennerty said.
"He's a father."
Abudayyeh didn't return mul-
tiple requests for comment and
neither his cell phone nor office
phone could take messages Sunday
because voicemail boxes were full.
Word of the raids sent a ripple
throughout activist circles.
One group of anti-war activists
in Chicago called an "emergency
meeting" on Chicago's South Side
yesterday to plan demonstrations
and rallies for Monday and Tues-
day.
"These raids are an attack on
the entire anti-war movement,"
said Maureen Murphy, a member
of the Palestine Solidarity Group
in Chicago. "Everyone in peace
and social justice is deeply con-
cerned."
FBI officials, who served six
warrants in Minneapolis and two
in Chicago, have said there was no
imminent threat to the commu-
nity. There were no arrests.
Those served were subpoenaed
to appear before a federal grand
jury in Chicago next month.
In Chicago, anti-war activists
Joe Iosbaker and his wife, Stepha-
nie Weiner, said the government
targeted them because they've
been outspoken against the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S.
funding of conflicts abroad. They
denied any wrongdoing.
The homes of longtime Min-
neapolis anti-war activists Mick
Kelly, Jess Sundin and Meredith
Aby were also searched.
Several activists said they
thought the searches amounted to
"fishing expeditions" in light of a
recent U.S. Supreme Court Deci-
sion.
In June, the Court rejected a
free-speech challenge to the law
from humanitarian aid groups
that said some provisions put
them at risk of being prosecuted
for talking to terrorist organiza-
tions about nonviolent activities.
The federal law cited in the search
warrants prohibits "providing
material support or resources to
designated foreign terrorist orga-
nizations."

Chavez rallies supporters
in congressional elections

Opponents attempt
to end Venezuela
president's 12-year
power streak
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -
Opponents of Venezuelan Presi-
dent Hugo Chavez tried to break
his long-standing monopoly on
power yesterday in congressio-
nal elections, while the firebrand
leader rallied his supporters urg-
ing them to "attack" through the
ballot box.
Voters formed long lines at
polling stations during elections
that stirred strong sentiment on
both sides of Venezuela's deep
political divide. After casting his
ballot, Chavez said turnout could
be as high as 70 percent.
"The people are speaking,"
Chavez said, calling it proof the
country has a healthy democ-
racy.
Opposition parties were try-
ing to end Chavez's domination
of the National Assembly for the
first time in his nearly 12 years in
the presidency. The vote is also
seen as a referendum on Chavez
himself ahead of the next presi-
dential election in 2012.
Polls suggest Chavez remains
the most popular politician in
Venezuela, yet surveys also have
shown a decline in his popular-
ity in the past two years as dis-
enchantment has grown over
problems including rampant vio-
lent crime, poorly administered
public services and inflation now
hovering at 30 percent.
The opposition, which boy-
cotted the last legislative
elections in 2005, stands to
dramatically increase its rep-
resentation beyond the 11 or so
lawmakers who defected from
Chavez's camp in the current
National Assembly. If Chavez's

majority of the 165 seats, oppo-
nents would have more clout in
trying to check his sweeping
powers.
"Democracy is at stake," said
Teresa Bermudez, a 63-year-
old Chavez opponent who stood
in a line that ran down a block
and around a corner in down-
town Caracas. She said she sees
the vote as a vital chance for the
opposition to have a voice and
achieve a more balanced legisla-
ture.
Chavez has fashioned him-
self as a revolutionary-turned-
president carrying on the legacy
of his mentor Fidel Castro, with
a nationalist vision and a deep-
seated antagonism toward the
U.S. government. He has largely
funded his government with
Venezuela's ample oil wealth,
touting social programs targeted

to his support base.
Chavez portrayed the vote as
a choice between his "Bolivarian
Revolution" and opposition poli-
ticians he accuses of serving the
interests of the wealthy and his
adversaries in the U.S. govern-
ment.
"We're with this man because
this man is the one who has real-
ly done things for this country,"

Cordova, a 58-year-old lawyer
who dressed in signature Chavez
red for to vote. She pointed
to government projects in the
neighborhood as proof of prog-
ress: a new low-income apart-
ment building and cable cars

Both political camps had wit-
nesses at polling stations. Sol-
diers stood guard during the
balloting, joined by civilians
belonging to the Bolivarian Mili-
tia created by Chavez.

Senate must repeal discriminatory military policy
The Senate has once again failed to move on an impor-
tant national issue. On Tuesday, the Senate voted against
pushing forward a bill that would repeal "don't ask, don't
tell." DADT - an executive order enacted by President Bill Clin-
ton - allows gay men and women to serve in the military as long
as they withhold their sexual preferences. And while 69 percent of
Americans support the repeal, according to a Gallup poll, the Sen-
ate hasn't responded to the public's demands to repeal the law. The
Senate needs to find the political will to pass legislation that will
rectify this unconstitutional regulation.

Spam imitating life

N o one likes spam emails, but
some of us have lately had
nothing better to do than to
sort through them
(college students
emerging from
boring summer
internships know
what I mean). I've
received thou-
sands of junk '
e-mails over the
past few years, but
one day this sum- IMRAN
mer, I decided to SYED
sit down and actu-
ally read a few.
Surprisingly, it
proved worthwhile.
What does spam say about us -
both those who create it and those
for whom it is created? The original
intent of spam emails is no differ-
ent from the junk mail in your real
mailbox or the glossy inserts in the
Sunday paper: business. But for every
Netflix 30-day trial offer, there are
ten fraudulent solicitations from
very formal Nigerian businessmen,
several winning lottery numbers
(invariably from a mystical Europe-
an country) and, of course, plenty of
offers for miracle pills.
Most of those constitute the dark
side of spam - more than just annoy-
ing - they ensnare plenty of users
into dangerous scams. But these
days, almost everyone should know
that any e-mail asking for your bank
account and routing numbers to
validate your library card is a rather
uninspired scam.
Looking beyond the well-docu-
mented scam or explicit facets of junk
e-mail, we come to the little matter of
language. I know that's an iffy sub-
ject - in a time when a black man
who speaks authoritatively is called
an elitist, this discussion is probably
an impossible battle. But stay with me
for a moment.
In personal encounters, nothing
defines people with a better combina-

tion of efficiency and accuracy than
their language. I don't mean accents
- such obvious indicators can signal
only broad and probably unfair ste-
reotypes. But go a step beyond, and
you learn exactly who you're dealing
with. Word choice often indicates
cultural influences and broader con-
versational style reveals much more
about personality than clothing or
outward appearance (both of which
are more conscious choices).
In every encounter, people talk the
way they think they're supposed to
talk, and that yields a gold mine: A
person's conception of how the world
works. Spammers are no different.
Their execution speaks volumes
about how our society believes cer-
tain things are done.
Let's take, for example, a spam
e-mail I received a few months ago.
The subject line of the e-mail reads:
"((((((( Congratulations ))))))) Your
e-mail Won our Lottery."
Not impressed? Not even with the
14 parentheses that presumably sig-
nal a jubilant cry ringing from the
hilltops? This particular e-mail was
indeed very easy to sniff out. For
example, why would a message that
originated in America (as indicated
by the little flag next to the sender's
address) award a prize in British
pounds sterling? And why would
an official e-mail from Yahoo! be
sent from a Gmail account? I know
Google's good, but come on.
Getting into the actual language of
the e-mail, we find sputterings like:
"KEEP THIS PRIVATE AND CON-
FIDENTIAL UNTIL YOU RECEIVE
YOUR PRIZE MONEY. NOTE THAT
NOBODY OR EVEN THE APPOINT-
ED BANK HAS THE RIGHT TO
TOUCH, DEDUCT/CUT OR GET
ACCESS TO YOUR PRIZE MONEY
FOR ANY REASON THEY HAVE
BEEN WARNED STRICTLY!"
The first thing to mention is the
poor grammar, but that's not surpris-
ing: The average person (and thus the
average spammer) is a poor writer

and will suffer missteps in attempt-
ing to copy official language. Anoth-
er thing to note is that people often
use particular words just because
they think they are supposed to.
This quote, for example, includes the
words "private" and "confidential,"
and "deduct" and "cut" in a redun-
dant, over-the-top attempt at official
bank language.
Such spam signals with stark clar-
ity the vast divide between how we
actually talk and how we think we are
supposed to talk. This divide is what
causes all these stylistic errors in emu-
lation. (I don't doubt that some errors
are by spammers who don't speak
English. But, as a former writing tutor,
I would guess that the error patterns
noted above are the work of someone
who can speak English fluently, but
has little practice writingit.)
In e-mails and
life, language
reveals everything.
Most important is the meaning
of that divide between how we talk,
and what we perceive to be profes-
sional language. The average person
is clueless as to how the latter works,
and therefore suspicious of it. Any
attempts at lifting the level of dis-
course, be it in political campaigns
or in the workplace, must begin with
the defeat of the idea that correct
language is reserved for formal situ-
ations. That process starts when we
stop emulating polished language
and start actually learning it.
True, such a thing might empower
spammers, but that's a small price to
pay for how much it would empower
the rest of us.

During the Clinton administration, Clin-
ton was unable to repeal the Defense Depart-
ment ban on gays in the military. Instead,
he created DADT, allowing members of the
LGBT community to serve in the military.
When elected, President Barack Obama stat-
ed that repealing DADT would be a prior-
ity of his administration. Defense Secretary
Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair-
man Adm. Mike Mullen have also stated that
DADT is out of date and should be repealed.
And while the repeal was recently approved
in the House, the Senate was unable to get
the filibuster-proof 60 votes needed to send
it to a conference committee.
According to a Sept. 21 report by CNN,
Republicans in the Senate filibustered a
defense reauthorization bill that would also
repeal DADT. This bill also contained pro-
visions for the DREAM Act, which would
provide a path to citizenship for children
of illegal immigrants who have graduated
from a U.S. high school and attend two
years of a four-year university or serve in
the military. All Republicans voted against
pushing the bill forward. Two Democrats
from Arkansas also voted against the bill.
Senate majority leader, Harry Reid (D-Nev.)
voted against the bill in a procedural move,
allowing it to be rescheduled for future
debate. The final Senate vote was 56 to 43.
60 votes are needed to override the threat
of a filibuster and proceed on a bill.
The Defense Department ban on gay

people in the military is not only unfair
and discriminatory - it's also unconstitu-
tional. It's disappointing that in a nation
built upon the ideals of free speech and
freedom of belief, individuals are com-
pelled to hide their preferences because of
fear of discrimination.
In addition to being discriminatory, the
ban has proved to be unpopular. A May
2009 Gallup poll showed that the majority
of the American public wants to repeal the
ban. Obama and his administration and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff want
to repeal the ban. The House has already
passed it and now it is about time the Senate
got on board.
This bill fell prey to partisan politics.
To win political support, Senators once
again killed good legislation. This parti-
san stalemate isn't particular to DADT
- most major pieces of legislation have
met the same opposition. In a political
climate where major policy issues need to
be addressed, Congress spends more time
squabbling than getting something done.
It's time for Congress to work together and
fulfill the role of the legislative branch.
Prohibiting members of the LGBT com-
munity from serving -in the military is a
backward policy that needs to be done away
with as soon as possible. And, at this point,
it's up to Senate to repeal the ban. America
has seen enough partisan politics. What it
now demands is action.

LEAH POTKIN I
Best three years of your life?

That's right, three, not four. That's one less
year of partying, football games and preparing
for the real world. It sounds terrible, I know,
but let's not forget that also means one year
less of exams, papers and, most compellingly,
tuition. So put down your textbooks, wal-
lets and beer cans and suit up for what might
be a peek into the future of higher education
programs. And with the current state of the
economy and staggering tuition costs showing
no signs of abatement, more students should
begin considering this alternative.
The alternative I'm referring to is complet-
ing college in three years. American culture
has trained us to accept the four-year progres-
sion from freshman to sophomore, sophomore
to junior and the final right of passage from
junior to senior. But who said students actually
need that longto complete their degree or to be
prepared to enter the 9-to-5 work world? The
answer: nobody.
I don't want to get carried away with this idea,
especially considering I am beginning tny junior
year and would throw a temper tantrum if told I
would be graduating at the end of winter semes-
ter. Some may consider this closed-mindedness a
bit immature of me, and truth be told, it is. How-
ever, that's because the three-year undergradu-
ate program is largely a foreign concept to me.
But the novelty of this idea shouldn't undermine
its potential worth (and I assure you there is
potential worth). So, keeping in mind that almost
all current students, including me, will prob-
ably opt for the typical four-years of college you
expect, let's look at what a three-year curriculum
might have to offer for students who will face
increasing college costs.
Let's start with the most basic and allur-
ing perk - one less year of tuition. In case
you haven't looked at your account inquiry
on Wolverine Access recently, that's a lot of
money (especially for out-of-state students
like myself). And tuition isn't all - this also
translates into money saved on textbooks,
housing and much more. Graduating a year
sooner would also mean an added year of
income (assuming the job market improves),
which could in turn help students pay offsloans
sooner and get settled into their adult lives
faster. If diving into the work force isn't your
plan, graduating in three years could instead
provide you with extra time to search for that

perfect job, or to travel and "find yourself"
as many young adults yearn to do post-grad-
uation. Simply put: time is money. It's just a
matter of how you use the extra time to your
advantage.
While most universities currently aren't
geared to a three-year matriculation cycle, it
wouldn't necessarily be daunting to accom-
modate the necessary changes. In their recent
New York Times article "A Degree in Three,"
Stephen Joel Trachtenberg and Gerald Kauvar
(both affiliated with George Washington Uni-
versity) described the hypothetical school cal-
endar for a three-year undergraduate education
and how students would likely take classes over
the summers with shortbreaks between semes-
ters to complete their curriculum in a short-
ened amount of time. Once again, it sounds
crazy, I know. How dare anyone suggest taking
away our beloved summer vacation? But think:
many University students take classes offered
during the University's spring and summer
terms. Clearly, campus still has professors will-
ing to teach during these months and enough
staff to maintain buildings.
Alternatively, many students already keen
to this new three-year concept are signing up
for summer classes at community colleges dur-
ing summer vacation. Community colleges are
starting to beef up their curriculums to address
the demand. These summer courses tend to be
relatively inexpensive (especially compared
to tuition for a fourth year of school) and are
admittedly often not as difficult as the courses
offered at the student's four-year university.
Assuming these credits are recognized by the
four-year college, they allow the student to
complete the requirements for graduation in a
shorter amount of time.
It is also important to understand that this
change would not impact the quality or depth
of education. Rather, only the layout would
change. Even now, the four-year program isn't
what works for everybody. I know several stu-
dents who have graduated a semester early.
And it's becoming evident that the customary
four-year plan may not be the most efficient or
practical option for every student. With all this
in mind, it wouldn't be a bad idea for colleges to
consider promoting a three-year plan.

ventures on campus, Mehta said.
Entrepreneurship provides a
new option to students who can't
or don't want to follow the typi-
cal path of earning good grades,
graduating from college and then
working at a large cooperation, he
added.
"Two or three years ago a lot of
students couldn't find a job after
they graduated, and rather than
try to find another way to work,
most went to graduate school,"
Mehta said. "Entrepreneurship is
a way that you can go through to
start your own business."
To participate in the competi-
tion, students can submit a 30-sec-
ond to three-minute business pitch
video that will be posted online.
Each pitch fits into one of ten
categories - including environ-
ment, local business, consumer
products, technology, health and
mobile applications.
The competition ends Nov. 19
and is followed by an award cer-
emony in early December, which
announces the winner of each cat-

egory and monetary prizes that
* total more than $10,000. This
year, there are roughly 15 sponsors
from companies, organizations
and individuals located in Ann
Arbor.
"Most of our sponsors started
as small businesses at some point
in time, and every small business
starts as an idea," Mehta said. "So
it all ties back to what the whole
competition is about: idea genera-
tion and thinking big."

have more speed and athleticism
than the Falcons. And Gardner's
mobility was limited by his inex-
perience, running laterally more
often than north and south, which
quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said will come with age.
Neither of them - it goes with-
out saying - has the potential of
a Heisman Trophy candidate like
Robinson. And without that talent
and break-neck speed, gameplan-
ning against the Wolverines' quar-
terback (whoever it would be after
Robinson) becomes exponentially
easier for opposing teams.
Each opposing coach this sea-
son has noted the difficulty of
gameplanning for Robinson, often
noting that shutting him down
completely borders on impossible.
"Denard Robinson is going tos
make people look bad," Connecti-
cut coach Randy Edsall said after
the Wolverines' week-one win.
At Robinson's current pace,
he would finish the season with
2,193 yards passing and 2,064
yards on the ground. And without
a weighted system to produce an
overall score for each program,
which is then compared to Ph.D.
programs at other universities
across the country.
"It is very extensive, both int
collection and analysis," Duder-
stadt wrote of the methodology.
"Yet it is a new (and controversial)
scheme, and the jury will be out
for some time as to whether it is
useful or not."
Duderstadt also wrote that the
changes in methodology have
caused the survey, traditionally
released approximately once a
decade, to be delayed several years.
"Most of the delay of the current
evaluation (three years) had to do
with fine-tuning the methodology
into a format acceptable to the uni-
versities," Duderstadt wrote.
Paired with the new method-
ology, that delay has left many
programs eagerly awaiting the
new rankings. The rankings were
released to institutions earlier this
month, though they won't be pub-
licly available until Tuesday.
MPowered members and some
of the sponsors determine the
finalists, Mehta said. The judging
is ongoing as pitches are submit-
ted, and MPowered members whos
are trained to judge the entries
determine the top 10 finalists in
each division.
once the competition ends, the
top 10 finalists are notified and
then judged by a panel of Univer-
sity professors, business profes-
sionals and entrepreneurs in their
respective fields.
In addition to increasing the'
number of pitches, 1000 Pitches
intends to expand its presence in
the University community and
online.
"one of our big pushes for this
year is that we're looking for more
exposure of the competition,"
Barch said.
According to Barch, each pitch
will be automatically uploaded to aa
YouTube channel so that the pub-
lic can see all the submissions.
Another change is the push to
continue the idea behind 1000
Pitches once the competition ends,
Mehta said.
"We want 1000 to be the start of
the journey," he said.
MPowered members also have

been actively reaching out to fac-
ulty to make 1000 Pitches part of
curricula - encouraging profes-
sors to give extra credit for submis-
sions or even to require students to
submit pitches.
"It provides an opportunity
for a lot of students to apply what
they've learned in the classroom
to a real workd setting without
boundaries," Mehta said.
T'his year, Barch said MPowered
is focusing on its Pledge Program.

that explosiveness and big-play
offensive production on the field,
the Wolverines don't have enough
potential to make up for their
shaky defense, especially against
solid Big Ten programs.
Robinson is-going to give a lot
of Michigan fans high blood pres-
sure this season, especially if he
continues to take unnecessary hits
like the one that knocked him out
of the game Saturday.
Forcier and Gardner may "stay
ready" all season, but without that
burst of adrenaline and the walk-
ing, talking hyperbole, unlaced
every Saturday, this team, with its
frighteninglytyoung defense, will
likely head down a similar path to
last season.
So when Robinson gets hit like
he did on Saturday, especially in
more physical games like Ohio
State or Michigan State, there's
only one thing you can do.
Cross your fingers.

Though the rankings have tradi-
tionally been important to leaders
in higher education, Duderstadt
said the rankings are not nearly as
important to students or industry
leaders.
"While faculty and academic
administrators may eventually find
useful information in this analysis,
I seriously doubt whether it will
be very meaningful to students,"
Duderstadt wrote. "I've always felt
that the best guide to students is
whether there are well-known fac-
ulty in the areas of their particular
interests rather than any generic
ranking of the program."
Even then, Duderstadt wrote
that those who do consider the
rankings should do so lightly.
"While these are infinitely
more rigorous and, if interpreted
correctly, useful than the more
popular 'league tables' such as U.S.
News & World Report, QS, Times
Higher Education or Shanghai Jaio
Tong, they should still be taken
with a very hefty grain of salt,"
Duderstadt wrote.
The program encourages student
organizations to "pledge" a cer-
tain number of pitches that would
be submitted before a designated
deadline. If organizations reach
their pledge goal, they would
receive a monetary reward. The
last day to register for the Pledge
Program is Oct. 15.
Mehta added that members will
set up Pitch Stations, in which
members meet with different
organizations and talk with stu-
dents across campus to motivate
them to submit pitches.
While students can send in indi-
vidual pitches, Mehta said group
pitches are also encouraged.
"Their passion will feed off
each other, which will help them
create bigger and better ideas," he
said.
1000 pitches is also continu-
ing its "Operation Dorm Storm"
and "Attack the Hill" programs
- which were developed last year
to attract freshmen to enter the
competition. On Sunday evenings,
MPowered members go to one
residence hall to talk about 1000
Pitches, collect new pitches and
expose freshmen to entrepreneur-
ial thinking.

Since the competition just start-
ed, Mehta said he does not know
what new ideas students are com-
ing up with this year. However, he
said he is looking forward to see-
ing the pitches as the competition
progresses.
"Everybody has ideas," he said.
"Everybody sees problems in the
world but how do you solve these
problems? That's the mentality we
are trying to push students to go
through to generate ideas for this
competition."

Lt. gov. nominee
accepts Planned
Parenthood
endorsement in A2
By SABIRA KAHN
Daily StaffReporter
With 44 days left before voters
hit the polls, the Democratic Party
is steppingup its campaign efforts
to reach out to specific groups of
supporters across the state and in
Ann Arbor.
On Saturday, the Washtenaw
County Democratic Party host-
ed "Women for Bernero" a rally
to honor Planned Parenthood's
endorsement of Lansing Mayor
Virg Bernero for Michigan gover-
nor and Southfield Mayor Brenda
Lawrence for lieutenant governor.
Several individuals spoke -
including Lawrence, Christine
Green, state House of Represen-
tatives candidate for the 52nd
district, and Sarah Scranton,
executive director of Planned
Parenthood Affiliates of Michi-
gan - at the Washtenaw Coun-
ty Democratic office on Mains
Street.
In an interview before the
event, Lawrence said the aim of
the rally was to celebrate the can-
didates' pro-choice stance.
"The goal today is to have a rally
to promote awareness that (Berne-
ro and I) are both pro-choice tick-
ets and also just to get the word out
about our campaign," Lawrence
said. "We are campaigning very
hard on the Main Street agenda,
and we're going all over the state
to energize our supporters."
The rally, which attracted a
small group of families from Ann
Arbor and campaign volunteers,
was also organized to garner sup-
port from women voters. Accord-
ing to Lawrence, it's critically
important for candidates to woo
women voters.
"Once you get women on board,
women inherently bring other vot-
ers," Lawrence said. "They are the
best grassroots base that we have,
wcC

years as enrollment grew 17 per-
cent, Whitworth said in an inter-
view.
"The administration at U of
M was well aware of our need to
grow and to accommodate the
number of students that we were
experiencing," Whitworth said.
University administrators
offered WCC University class-
room space, indicating that the
collaboration would alleviate
space concerns at both institu-
tions, Whitworth said. The agree-
ment allows the University to

and women believe in candidates
that make the difference."
The event opened with Green
- who is running against Repub-
lican candidate and Washtenaw
County Commissioner Mark Oui-
met- pushing those in attendance
to support her bid for a seat in the
House of Representatives.
"We have some very clear dis-
tinctions between my Republi-
can opponent and me, and one of
those distinctions is reproductive
freedom, and I am unambiguous-
ly pro-choice," Green said to the
crowd.
Green concluded her speech
by emphasizing her belief that
women have the right to make
their own decisions regarding
their bodies.
"I am S9 years old now, and I
don't think in my lifetime that I'm
going to see a time when we don't
have to fight really, really hard
for reproductive freedom," Green
said.
Scranton then spoke to the
audience telling them that abor-
tion is a women's health and wom-
en's rights issue.
Scranton, who has worked at
Planned Parenthood for eight
years, said legal questions sur-
rounding abortion have surfaced
every year since she has been an
employee.
"Every single legislature has
tried to ban abortion," Scranton
said. "We are very lucky in that we
have a pro-choice governor right
now."
According to Scranton, Ber-
nero and Lawrence are the only
candidates in the gubernatorial
race who "stand up for women's
health and a woman's right to
choose."
Lawrence then stepped forward
to accept Planned Parenthood's
campaign endorsement.
"I'm a proud mother of two
beautiful children," Lawrence told
the audience. "I'm not anti-life.
I'm very much pro-having-chil-
dren in a planned environment
and women having the right (to
choose)."
After accepting the endorse-

ment, Lawrence discussed other
important campaign issues and
highlighted the experience on the
Democratic ticket.
"Bernero and I are two mayors
who have rolled up their sleeves
and are running for governor and
lieutenant governor," she said.
"This has never happened in the
state. It has never happened in the
country."
She went on to stress that pre-
vious political experience is vital
for holding office, but especially
in this particular election given
Michigan's economic state.
"This is a time of crisis. This is
not a time for peopletoget a learn-
ing curve," Lawrence said, refer-
ring to Republican gubernatorial
candidate Rick Snyder and his lack
of government experience.
Lawrence highlighted ideas for
economic reform, which includes
plans for a state-run bank that will
grant loans to small businesses.
"We must invest in our small
business, and we're proud to say
that we're the mayors from Main
Street," Lawrence said. "We take
care of Main Street."
She also discussed the need for
politicians to focus on education,
saying that lawmakers made the
wrong decision to cut the Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship, which
gave thousands of dollars in schol-
arships to college students across
the state.
"We made a promise to our
young people and we broke it,"
Lawrence said. "We told them that
if you maintain a GPA that we'll
invest in you and make sure that
you get an education and that you
get scholarships. We broke that
promise. The funding issues for
our children's education must be
a priority."
She concluded her speech by
encouraging women to go out and
vote for the Democratic ticket.
"The last time we sat on our
hands and didn't come out and
vote Democratic, you know what
happened? We got (former Repub-
lican Gov. John) Engler," Law-
rence said. "We cannot afford that.
Michigan cannot afford that."


better utilize space that might not
otherwise be used and ensures
that WCC has enough space to
hold all its courses.
Whitworth said the agreement
would also benefit students at the
University since many enroll in
WCC classes.
"We know that there are lots
of students from the University
of Michigan that come to Washt-
enaw Community College and
that this might be more conve-
nient," Whitworth said.
Many WCC students live or
work near downtown Ann Arbor.
Classes held on the University's
campus allow students to walk
or bike to class rather than drive

to WCC's main campus, which is
located between Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti.
"It seemed like a great partner-
ship as a way to offer classes more
conveniently for the WCC stu-
dents here in Ann Arbor," Fitzger-
ald said.
In future semesters, WCC plans
to expand its course selection on
Central Campus to accounting,
sociology, communications, com-
puter science and political sci-
ence.
"We are currently engaged in
developing a two-year contract,"
Whitworthsaid. "We're hoping to
be able to promote the program a
little more aggressively."

For Rabh1, not
many home
during a day of
campaigning

A CRITICAL MASS OF CYCLISTS

From Page 1A
registered voters cast their bal-
lots. Other residence halls like
South Quad and Mary Markley
had a 2.64 percent and .8 percent
turnout, respectively.
Rabhi said he's seeking to raise
those numbers with student-cen-
tered campaigning. For Rabhi,
this campaigning means meeting
voters face-to-face.
"I feel like the core of cam-
paigning is talking face-to-face,"
he said in an interview yesterday.
Rabhi spent Friday afternoon
walking down Packard Street and
Hill Street with a stack of cam-
paign literature in hand and an
eagerness to engage every poten-
tial voter he encountered.
Despite Rabhi's evident enthu-
siasm, few residents were home.
It took several unanswered
doorbells before the first door
swung open. The young man
behind it was dressed insa bright
yellow University hoodie.
Noticing the University appar-
el, Rabhi introduced himself as "a
University of Michigan student
just like yourself."
Rabhi then launched into the
details of his campaign - describ-
ing his goal to preserve Washt-
enaw County social services like
homeless shelters, mental health
care programs and health care
packages for Washtenaw Coun-
ty's lower class residents.
At some point during Rabhi's
talk with the student, several
young men walking by stopped
outside the house.
"That's Yousef," said one of

the passersby to the others. "He's
running for county commission-
er."
Rabhi turned and waved to the
passersby before resuming his
conversation with the student.
After talking with the poten-
tial supporter, Rabhi headed
down Cross Street but was met
with more empty houses.
"People must already be party-
ing or something," Rabhi said. "I
was expecting people to be home
today."
Nevertheless, Rabhi did get
to speak with several registered
student voters at their homes who
said they were excited about his
campaign.
At a house on Division Street,
University graduate student
David Weinglass said he was
impressed with Rabhi's age and
apparent drive to win.
"I think it's great seeing
(young) people out that are inter-
ested and not being apathetic,"
Weinglass said.
In a phone interview yesterday,
however, Rabhi said he's finding
it increasingly difficult to bal-
ance campaigning and his ever-
mounting course work.
"Homework takes a long time,"
said Rabhi, who's planning to
graduate this winter. "It's hard
for me to say, 'OK, I have to cam-
paign now,' because I have to
graduate."
Despite the workload, Rabhi
said he's still enthusiastic and
committed to campaigning.
"I'm still getting out there,"
Rabhi said. "It's always on my
mind."

Students and Ann Arbor residents ride their bikes down State St. yesterday as part of The Critical Mass bike ride. The ride was organized by the Ann Arbor Free Skool - an
organization that provides free classes and do-it-yourself workshops around Ann Arbor.
Jesse Jackson Jr.'s Wife: 'There
were sleepless nghts over affair

Congressman also in
hot water over ties
to Blagojevich
CHICAGO (AP) - The wife of
U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. said she
and her husband have undergone
marital counseling and spiritual
therapy since he told her nearly
two years ago of an extramarital
affair.
"He said it was over. I was mor-
tified and in agony, but he knew if
I found out any other way it would
be over. That the only way to save
our marriage was to come clean,"
Chicago Alderman Sandi Jackson
said in an interview published in
yesterday's editions of the Chicago
Sun-Times. "There were sleepless
nights and I started losing hair and
I told him I would only consider

staying if we got into therapy."
She said she immediately ques-
tioned herself and whether.it was
her fault, but she never wanted
details. When word of the affair
became public last week, she said it
was like opening the wound again.
Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat,
has been dogged by corruption
allegations in connection with
former Gov. Rod Blagojevich since
December 2008, shortly after
Blagojevich was arrested.
Last week, more allegations sur-
faced that Jackson told a business-
man to offer Blagojevich $6 million
in exchange for an appointment to
Barack Obama's former U.S. Sen-
ate seat. The businessman also told
the FBI he purchased plane tickets
for a woman identified as a "social
acquaintance" of Jackson.
Jackson, who has not been
charged with a crime, has repeat-

edly denied wrongdoing in con-
nection with Blagojevich.
He didn't, however, deny allega-
tions of an affair with the "social
acquaintance" and called ita "per-
sonal matter between me and my
wife that was handled some time
ago."
Messages left for Jackson on
Sunday by The Associated Press
weren't immediately returned.
In the interview, Sandi Jack-
son acknowledged empathy for
her husband, who she said "has
been quiet, withdrawn and con-
cerned."
"It's been surreal. I feel bad
for Jesse because he is living this
thing all over again. He is remorse-
ful over this fire storm he's created
around us," she said.
She also said her husband never
had an intention of running for
Chicago mayor and is instead gear-

ing up for re-election in his con-
gressional district covering parts
of Chicago's South Side and south
suburbs.
The congressman, who first
won election in his district in 1995,
previously said he's been mulling a
run for mayor since Mayor Rich-
ard Daley announced earlier this
month that he wouldn't seek a sev-
enth term.
The Jacksons have been mar-
ried since 1991 and have two chil-
dren.
Sandi Jackson said she could
never anticipate how she would
feel when her husband told her of
the affair.
"You know, when the Clintons
ran into marital trouble, I thought
Hillary should leave Bill," she
said. "I couldn't stand what Tiger
Woods did and howhis wife had to
suffer publicly.

Playing house with history

ne Christmas many years
ago, I received a PLAY-
MOBIL Grande Mansion
from Santa Claus. The beauti-
ful Victorian
dollhouse was
nearly as tall
as me, and it
was love at
first sight. I r
spent hours
rearranging
the furniture LEAH
(including BURGIN
a miniature
piano that
miraculously still plinks Ludwig
Van Beethoven's "Fur Elise"),
planning large doll dinner parties
and switching the dolls' outfits
from day attire to tea-time attire
to evening attire.
Even after my sister was
bestowed with a PLAYMOBIL
medieval castle (and then a prin-
cess palace and then a modern-
decor house), my heart still
belonged with my old-fashioned
three-story mansion. As recently
as last summer, I was tempted to
pull out the pieces and set it up
one more time.
My attachment to this doll-
house turned into a love for all
old houses with the aid of my
dad's purchase of "National
Geographic's Guide to America's
Great Houses," a compiled list of
* old, significant homes in America.
Some of the catalogued houses
are obvious - the White House,
the Hearst Castle, Frank Lloyd
Wright's Fallingwater - but
some are obscure, like the Cap-
tain Frederick Pabst Mansion
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This
house, which is touted as "the fin-
est Flemish renaissance revival
mansion in America," belonged to
the founder of the Pabst Brewing
Company. Oddly, it has yet to find
its true calling as a mecca for hip-
sters and frat boys.
During our family vacations,
my dad would plan the trips
around which houses from "the
book" we could see. We made it

Sadly uneventful

NBC's new sci-fi
thriller can't manage
its mysteries
By JAMIE BLOCK
ManagingArts Editor
While it's no surprise that
NBC's "The Event" is waiting to
reveal what its
title's all about,
the series pre-
miere was shock- The Event
ingly devoid of
any events what- Mondays
soever. at 9 p.m.
In the pilot, NBC
we jump hap-
hazardly between three time-
frames. The leaps are abrupt and
happen all too often, barring the
story from feeling cohesive. But all
things in all times seem to center
around Sean Walker (Jason Ritter,
"The Class"). Any attempt to say
who Walker is would be futile at
this stage, and that's exactly what
the show wants. He seems like a
normal dude who loves his girl-
friend, but he has ties to a group of
prisoners held on a mountaintop,
hijacks a plane and exhibits super-
human power including, but not
restricted to, creating wormholes
in space-time. Yeah, this"is gnhna
be one of those shows.

"The Event" is all aboutmystery,
but the show doesn't know how
to build any. From the countless
commercials, it was actually easily
predictable that "the event" would
be aliens altering the space-time
continuum. Well, that seems to
have happened - but instead of the
centric event, it was just the pilot
episode's cliffhanger.
At this year's San Diego Comic-
Con, the creators took several jabs
at "Lost" for not answering ques-
tions, assuring future fans that
"The Event" would be more sat-
isfying on that front. Apparently
what the producers were trying
to say is that all the mysteries will
have predictable answers and/or
nobody will care what the answers
are anyway. The only substantial
question so far is "Who are these
prisoners?" But with the dramatic
hesitation of President Elias Marti-
nez (Blair Underwood, "Dirty Sexy
Money") to describe them as "peo-
ple," along with allusions to the old
staple, "Take me to your leader,"
aliens are emerging as the obvious
answer.
Aliens would be a bit of a let-
down though, wouldn't it? We've
seen aliens before. Well, maybe
they're regular people who were
exposed to the event and derived
powers from it. Well that would
just make this another season of
"Heroes." And that's the series' big

problem. At this point, there does
not exist an answer for any of the
show's "big questions" that would
prove at all satisfying.
Maybe that wouldn't be the
case, though, if there were more
questions posed. The pilot wasted
an incredible amount of time on
Walker and his girlfriend's cruise
vacation. It engulfed a third of the
episode, and only hinted at rel-
evance near the storyline's end.
Even the scenes central to the
mountain facility lacked an air
of mystery. It was only the final
scene that begged for fan theoriz-
ing. But a strong cliffhanger does
not a fulfilling episode make (espe-
cially when that cliffhanger uses
CGI straight out of a Syfy original
movie).
For all its failures, "The Event"
could be addictive, just not in the
way its creators hoped. The big
mystery people will tune in for isn't
going to be "Who are these prison-
ers and why are they locked up?"
or "Why is Sean Walker so impor-
tant?" Instead, the question on
viewers' minds will be "Are these
really the best mysteries they could
come up with?"
Oh, and to anyone else out there
thinking of making a similar sci-fi
series: If your goal is to distance
yourself from "Lost," vanishing a
plane into a flash of light isn't the
best way to start. Just sayin'.

morosely begging to know just

not without a pang of melancholy.
The "why me?" attitude of the song
doesn't beg for sympathy. If any-
thing it emotionally resonates with
the listener, because who doesn't
want to know whetherthey'll be
loved forever?
Buzzard is definitely a small step
into Weirdsville for Margot and the
Nuclear So and So's (in a good way).
The album does lack cohesion, but
the non-sequitur quality is what
makes it work. They can go from
a Wilco-esque alt-country twang
"Claws Off" to borderline Gothic
"Let's Paint our Teeth Green."
The heavier sound can some-
times overwhelm Edwards' tra-
ditionally pretty voice, but there
is still enough acoustic balladry
("Lunatic, Lunatic, Lunatic," "I
Do"), to let his vocals get their due.
Though the musical quality runs
rich on Buzzard, it is still rather
difficult to discern what the heck
they are singing about. If we are in
Weirdsville, then weird is definite-
ly worth listening to.

Few cons for'Lone Star'*

By LINDSAY HURD
Daily Arts Writer
Premiering last Monday, FOX's
latest drama only drew in 4.1 mil-
lion viewers for the network, caus-
ing people to
believe the show
would soon be
canceled. Luck- LoneStar
ily, the network

more chance to FOX
survive.
The premise of
the show is pretty unprecedented,
combining two over-the-top ideas
into one fascinating plot line. Bob
Allen (James Wolk, "You Again")
is a hate-to-love con man who lives
two separate lives: one working for
his oil tycoon father-in-law (Jon
Voight, "National Treasure") in
Houston and the other as a simple
oil well salesman in a small Texan
town. Not only does he have two

jobs, but he's also in love with two
different women from his separate
lives. In addition, he has an evil
father (David Keith, "Heartbreak
Hotel") who has been conning his
way through life longer than Bob.
"Lone Star" pretty much combines
all the drama viewers loved about
"Dallas" with the poignancy of a
man searching for what he wants
in life.
Unlike similar shows that cross
the line into tackiness, "Lone Star"
never even reaches the line. The
dialogue is smart and convincing,
even when it's in an unbelievable
situation. Actors like Voight and
Keith play alarmingly convinc-
ing fathers on different ends of the
crazy spectrum, both going after
their money in opposite ways. The
plot is suspense-driven and shock-
ing when it needs to be. Many of the
elements are in place to lead "Lone
Star" to a successful season.
Nonetheless, the show does have
some major flaws. The biggest mis-
take is the strange casting of the
lead character. While Wolk is a
convincing actor, he just seems too
nice-looking for the part. The back-
drop of the show makes you think
of a Texan-born con man with a
big belt buckle and cowboy boots
to match. Wolk, on the other hand,
seems to be portraying someone
who could be from anywhere in the

country. He lacks a Texan accent
and his bland personality makes
the character just seem like an
averageniceguy. The resultis aBob

for him, especially after the stupid
move he makes at the end of the
first episode. Bob is kind of a twerp
who just needs to make up his
mind. He's got two amazing lives to
choose from, both with big money
and beautiful women. So why can't
he just pick one? Nobody deserves
to have two of everything, espe-
cially if you're justgoingto eff it up.
"Lone Star" does have its imper-
fections, but what show doesn't? It
doesn't deserve the awful ratings it
received on its premiere night and
certainly should be enjoyed more
- and by more people - than some
of the other crappy network shows
out there.

Michigan 65, Bowling Green 21
HREE'S COMPANY

TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daly
Sophomore quarterbacks Denard Robinson and Tate Forcier and freshman quarterback Devin Gardner walk out of the tunnel before Michigan's 65-21 win over Bowling Green. Each quarterback played in the rout.
Forcier makes most of opportunity 'M' wins behind

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
He waited 10 months and 205
game minutes, which felt like an
eternity to the quarterback who
started every Michigan football
game last season as a true fresh-
man.
In the shadow of sophomore
sensation and Heisman hopeful
Denard Robinson, Tate Forcier
learned his role on the team and
what being a backup quarterback
meant.
Robinson was sidelined with a
minor injury in the first quarter
of Saturday's game against Bowl-
ing Green. True freshman Devin
Gardner replaced the starter for a
few drives. Then, with 5:07 left in
the first half of Saturday's game
against Bowling Green, Forcier
entered a game for the first time
this season.
Senior offensive lineman Steve
Schilling said after the game that
Forcier had been "biding his time"
waiting for his chance to go in.
"Today was his time," Schilling
said.
Forcier made the most of it. He

for 110 yards and a touchdown. He

full team effort

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
In what could be considered the
ultimate team effort, the Michigan
football team had no trouble rolling
over Bowling Green on Saturday,
beating the Falcons 65-21.
The Wolverines got valuable
contributions from three quar-
terbacks - sophomores Denard
Robinson and Tate Forcier, as well
as freshman Devin Gardner. All
three took a good deal of snaps on
the way to a 34-point Michigan
victory.
The 109,933 in attendance at
Michigan Stadium held their col-
lective breath near the end of the
first quarter when Robinson, whose
play so far this season has vaulted
him to the top of the Heisman race,
laid on the ground injured after
being tackled on a 47-yard run
down Michigan's sideline.
Before being knocked out of the
game, Robinson was on track for
another statistically mind-boggling
afternoon. In just the first quar-
ter, the sophomore sensation was

4-for-4 for 60 yards through the air
and rushed for 128 yards and two
touchdowns on the ground.
Gardner replaced Robinson with
about six minutes to go in the first
quarter and looked impressive. The
Detroit native drove the Wolver-
ines down the field to score with an
11-yard touchdown pass to redshirt
freshman wide receiver Jeremy
Gallon.
Michigan went into the second
quarter up 21-0 on the Falcons, but
down a quarterback.
The second quarter was a forget-
table one for the Michigan defense,
which played well otherwise, as
Bowling Green scored two touch-
downs to cut the lead to seven.
But with five minutes left in
the first half, the crowd at the Big
House was treated to a familiar
sight. Forcier ran outon the field for
the first time this season and got a
very warm reception.
"Of course I heard (the crowd),"
Forcier said after the game. "How
can you not? Our crowd is so loud.
The crowd always motivates you.
See TEAM EFFORT, Page 3B

Sophomore Tate Forcier completed 12 passes for 110 yards in his season debut against Bowling Green.

30 yards.
Forcier's 12-for-12 day set the
Michigan record for completion
percentage when the quarterback
has taken at least 10 attempts. The
previous record belonged to Jim
Harbaugh, who went 12-for-13
(92.3 percent) against Purdue on
Nov. 9,1985.

"Tate's a good thrower, a good
football player," quarterbacks
coach Rod Smith said. "The key to
him, just like any other player, is
you've got to stay focused, you've
got to stay disciplined in your reads
and what you do. Everything else
comes natural for those guys."
Focus has been a word thrown

around when discussing Forcier
over the past few months. After a
teammate called him out for miss-

rust in Florida

hrough four weeks and
T four wins this season,
there have been an awful
lot of winners walking the Michi-
gan sideline.
The most obvious winner has
been sophomore sensation Denard
Robinson who
has captivated
the nation
and leads the
NCAA with 688
rushing yards..
Robinson's
performance
has also shone
a light on the RYAN
team's primary KARTJE
wideouts - Roy _--
Roundtree,
Darryl Stonum and Martavious
Odoms - who have all come alive
at some point or another in non-
conference play.
Even Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez, who was vilified for
the better of eight months before
the season began, has proven that
"winning cures a lot," just like he
said a month before the opener.
He's probably enjoyed a great deal
more sleep in the last month than
he had through the entire offsea-
son.
But for all of Michigan's shiny
results through a third of the sea-
son, there's been one lemon along
for the ride. And winning may not
cure enough to save his job.
Defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson, in his second year run-
ning the defense, has done little
to prove that he deserves to be off
the hotseat, which he and Rodri-
guez shared at the start of the
season.
Since year one of Rodriguez's
tenure, the Wolverines' defense
has been slowly decaying.
Under Scott Shafer - who was
first brought to Ann Arbor by
Rodriguez - Michigan gave up a

Michigan defensive coordinator Greg Robinson's defense has alowed 400 yards per game this seasor

fairly putrid 366 yards per game.
Although a 3-9 record may have
had something to do with it, Shafer
was fired without many questions
after the season.
After fielding one of the worst
teams in the FBS in 2008, Robin-
son was removed as head coach of
Syracuse and hired by Rodriguez
to lead the Wolverine defense. The
results he yielded in his first season
were 27 yards worse than Shafer's
defense. And he was kept on.
And four games into his sec-
ond season, the results have been
even worse. Robinson's defense
was crushed for 535 yards against
Notre Dame-the second-highest
in a win in program history. Then,
the week after, the Wolverines
gave up 439 yards to an FCS squad
that the defense was absolutely ill-
prepared for.
The Wolverines are the second
worst defense among undefeated
teams in the FBS (only Oklahoma
is worse), and overall, they come in
at a stunningly awful 90th place in
total defense, allowing 400 yards
per game.

That's not acceptable, unless
you're playing your buddy on Play-
station.
And don't blame it completely on
a lack of talent. Yes, the secondary
was expected to struggle because
depth at the position group was
paper thin. But at positions like
linebacker (which Robinson per-
sonally coaches), Robinson's unit
has underachieved on a consistent
basis.
For comparison's sake, Shafer,
who left town foo Robinson's old
home in Syracuse, has the 29th-
ranked defense in the FBS, while
his defense is allowing almost 100
yards less than the Wolverines
have on average.
That means only one thing
with three quarters of the season
remaining: Greg Robinson has the
most to prove of anyone in Ann
Arbor when Big Ten season starts
next Saturday.
To say Rodriguez needs to fire
Robinson to save his job, like ESPN
analyst Mark May said following
Michigan's win over Massachu-
setts, is unfounded and untrue.

But when it comes time to evaluate
this team's coaching staff at the
end of the season, there should
be a long look at Robinson's track
record through two years with the
program.
When Athletic Director Dave
Brandon was asked this offseason
how Rodriguez could keep his job,
Brandon said that he didn't need to
win a certain amount of games, but
he needed to demonstrate a signifi-
cant improvement and step in the
right direction. There's no reason
why Robinson shouldn't be held to
the same standards.
So far Rodriguez, helped by his
record-breaking offense, is on his
way to doing that and Robinson is
eating his dust.
While the defense showed some
improvement this past weekend,
consider the word out: If Greg Rob-
inson doesn't show noted improve-
ment in Big Ten season, there's no
reason why his bags shouldn't be
packed.

Wolverines deal
with weather-related
inconsistencies
By MATT KRASNOFF
Daily Sports Writer
With summer coming to a close
in Ann Arbor, a weekend slate to
Florida seemed like the perfect
getaway for the Michigan women's
tennis team.
But off-and-on wet weather
caused competition to be post-
poned on Friday in Coral Gables.
That postponement left the Wol-
verines with just two days of
competition, which made for a
weekend of inconsistent play in the
non-scoring event.
The fall is generally used as
tune-up time for collegiate tennis.
Players compete as individuals in
order to improve their rankings,
while coaches tinker with lineups
in order to find the right combi-
nations for the spring. For that
reason, Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein took all nine of her play-
ers to the Miami Fall Tournament.
Michigan will most likely be
a top-10 team when spring rolls
around, after finishing last season
ranked No. 8 nationally. But even
for a squad that went 10-0 in Big
Ten play last year, there's always a
little rust to shake off.
"After the summer we're defi-
nitely not playing our best and
need to go back to work when we
get back," Bernstein said.
After the initial rain, the Wol-
verines won four singles matches
and a doubles match. No.12 Denise
Muresan highlighted the day
with a victory over No. 106 Jenny
Frisell from Central Florida. The

Michigan senior nearly blanked
her ranked opponent, winning the
match 6-0, 6-1.
Senior captains Whitney Taney
and Rika Tatsuno - the nation's
No. 4 doubles team - lost their
match on Saturday to the 16th
ranked team from Miami. Taney
came out of the match a bit sore
and did not participate in any
matches on Sunday, but the injury
isnot considered to be serious.
On the second day, the Wolver-
ines lost all of their singles match-
es, a credit to Miami's solid play.
"(Miami's) tough and they're
used to playing at home," Bern-
stein said. "But I don't think we
played our best."
And while the day was not
Michigan's finest, Bernstein rec-
ognizes the ample amount of time
her team has to improve.
"It's a little disappointing," Ber-
nstein said. "But we have tons of
time, so it's not time to get crazy
with the results."
Bernstein commented on the
team's lack of positive energy, not-
ing that the scorching heat started
to take a toll on the girls. But after
team chemistry and camarade-
rie fueled the squad last year, she
expects her senior-led team to
overcome this glimmer of adver-
sity.
And getting back into the swing
of things should come alittle easier
when the Wolverines return home.
Ann Arbor will host the Wolverine
Invitational next weekend, and
Bernstein knows that the results
from Miami are something to
build on for the future.
"We're excited, but we're not
content with where we are," Ber-
nstein said. "So we have to work
hard and the girls know that, so
that's what we'll do."

loss didn't reflect the competitive-
ness of the rivalry, which opened
the Wolverines' Big Ten slate.
Michigan (0-1-0 Big Ten, 5-2-2
overall) hung on for much of the
game, but defensive lapses in the
second half ended the Wolverines'
chances.
The Wolverines came into the
game with a 6-0-3 record in con-
ference openers since 2000. Look-
ing past the rivalry, the game
drops Michigan to 0-1 in the Big
Ten after five wins in non-confer-
ence play including a 5-0 win over
Massachusetts.
"We have been coming off such
a high because of the wins we have
been producing in non-conference
games," senior defender Sarah
Stanezyk said. "The loss was a big
blow because of the rivalry ... but
we need to put the game in the
past, learn from our mistakes and
move forward."

was going to be a difficult match.
"(Ohio State) is always one or

In the first half, both teams
possessed the ball and had qual-
ity scoring chances. In net, red-
shirt sophomore Haley Kopmeyer
recorded six saves and was helped
out of the crossbar on one key
play. In that play, Ohio State's best
opportunity to that point hit off of
the crossbar on a corner kick.
At halftime, Ryan made changes
in order to have the offense pres-
sure the defense near the box. The

Wolverines did just that as more
pressure created more opportu-
nities in front of the Buckeye net.
But despite their aggressive play,
the Wolverines couldn't produce
enough quality shots.
"Our plan is to play hard and
play teams under pressure," Ryan
said.
Midway through the half,
freshman forward Nkem Ezurike
headed the ball in front of the goal,
nearly giving the Wolverines the
lead, but to no avail. Ezurike led
the team with three shots, two of
them on goal. The team total was

Michigan can't
convert on scoring
chances, drops
another close game
By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan men's soccer coach
Steve Burns borrowed a little
inspira-
tion from OHIO STATE 1
actor Al MICHIGAN 0
Pacino
in the movie Any Given Sunday to
get his team in the right frame of
mind heading into Friday night's
matchup with rival Ohio State.
As Pacino did, Burns assured
his team that the Big Ten season
opener was going to be a game of
inches - and he was spot-on.
The Wolverines (0-1-0 Big Ten,
4-2-3 overall) dropped an aggres-
sive match to the 23rd-ranked
Buckeyes 1-0 in front of a packed
house on Friday. The crowd of
3,207 witnessed a match high-
lighted by 14 combined goalkeep-
er saves and a penalty kick - but
no Michigan goals.
"To pull a crowd like this ... this
is a game we circle on the sched-
ule as a win that we need to have,"
senior captain Alex Wood said.
"Looking at the final statistics,
sometimes that's the way soccer
is played. We'll learn from this

It's hard to push the Michigar
football team around espe-
cially in the red zone.
On both sides of the ball, the
Wolverines' line play has beer
somewhat
of a strength NOTEBOOK
this season.
And Michigan has had suc-
cess punching the ball into the
end zone, as well as preventing
opposing offenses from doing
the same.
In Michigan's 65-21 win ove
Bowling Green on Saturday, twvo
of the Falcon touchdowns came
on fouTrth-and-goal situations
after the Wolverines stoppe
them short on the first three
downs inside the five-yard line.
Bowling Green resorted to the
Wildcat formation and fresh-
matsrunoing back Jordan Hop-
good took a direct snap the
first time, lie barely scored ans
the second time, it took an extr
effort to get around Michigan'si
wall of defensive players.
"We could not run the foot-
ball, and really, even when we
scored on some of those goal line
plays, we were a little bit lucky,'
Bowling Green coach Dave
Classon said after the game. "t
was because of a great individual.
effort in the backfield; it's noI
because we have people blocker
up front or we created a push
at the line of scrimmage. They
completely controlled us up
front. To be honest with you, thaI
was our biggest concern coming
into the game."
All the offensive line did was

yards and eight red zone touch-
downs - including six on the
ground. After Saturday, Michi

ciency is 89 perent - the oteamr

was in serious doubt.
Rumors that he would transfer
began swirling around campus after
Rodriguez named Robinson the
starter for the season opener. The
rumors gathered steam when Gard-
ner became the second-string quar-
terback and Forcier got bumped to
third string.
"A lot of people said I'm not stay-
ing here," Forcier said. "But I'm still
here. I love Michigan. I love every-
thing about it. I'm not going to leave
- not a chance. I love Coach Rod.
I love these fans. I love Michigan
football."
Forcier's giddiness was evident
when he was asked what it felt like
to get into the game.
"Oh God, I was so happy. I was
so happy," Forcier said. "It felt like
it was my first start again. It just felt
so good to go out there and hear the
crowd."
Fans gave Forcier a warm recep-
tion both when he entered the game
in the second quarter and when he
exited in the fourth after his flaw-
less passing day.
While some teammates main-
tained that Forcier was the same
quarterback he was last year, Forci-
er and the coaching staff discussed
notable improvements. Forcier said
- the game has slowed down for him.
Rodriguez agreed.
"He's more comfortable seeing
the field," Rodriguez said. "As (he
and Robinson) go throughout their
careers, they start seeing things as
coaches see them as far as not just
focusing on one thing during the
play, but they see a whole field and
why a play should work."
In addition to Forcier's reads
and comfort in the pocket, he also
showed improvement his passing.
The Wolverines, who mixed their
pass and run games well - 466
rushing yards and 255 passing -
saw very crisp, accurate passes from
Forcier. More passing plays are part
of the game plan when he's under
center.
"We try to gear to each quarter-
back's strength," Smith said. "All of
them can run - Denard's just more
explosive than others. (True fresh-
man Devin Gardner) can run and
Tate can rut, too. We still mix it in,
but maybe not quite as much. We
try to play to their strengths and go
from there."
Robinson tweaked his knee,
according to Rodriguez, in Satur-
day's first quarter and didn't return.
The injury isn't expected to be seri-
ous, so Forcier's and Gardner's play-
ing time will likely decrease in the
coming weeks. Forcier says he'll be
readyto fill whatever role he's need-
ed for.
"You never know when your
number is going to be called. The
Big Ten is a big conference, a rough
conference, and it starts up next
week," Forcier said. "You have to be
prepared.

t pride in not gett ing pushed back-
wards," he said.
RUNNING AWAY WITH IT:
s It may have been hard to keep
track of which runnting back was
on the fiekd by the end of Satur-
day's game.
Nine players carried the ball 56
times. Sophomore Vincent Smith
i and junior :Mike Shaw each lead
f the team with12 carries each.
M ich igan's leadi log rushers,
t however, were sophomore quar-
terback Denard Robinson who
ran for 129 yards on five carries,
t and redshirt freshman running
r back Fitzgerald Toussaint, who
carried the ball six times for 129
t yards.
t The efficient group effort
o resulted in 466 yards on the
ground.
s But the takeaway might be
s that Michigan coach ich Rodri-
guez was finally able to play
more of his running backs. Sat-
urtday marked the season debuts
of Toussaint and redshirt sopho-
t more Mike Cox.
"I think all of my guys are
pretty good," running backs
coach Fred Jackson said. "I
t just got to put them in situa-
tions where they can have some
success so I can examine what
tant considering Minneso-
ta's physical advantage. The
Golden Gophers are a taller
and bigger squad, and they
recorded 17 team blocks to
Michigan's nine.
"One thing we talked
about before the match is
that (Minnesota) is a very
physical team," Rosen said.
"They make their money by
being physical. I kind of liken
them to being bullies... They
will come in here and try to
intimidate our team a little
bit. I told our team that, that's
what they're trying to do."
Thanks to a balanced game
plan, Michigan snuck in an
upset win over its first ranked
opponent of the season.
"This is one of the big-
gest wins ever," Rosen said.
"That's because of how the
match played out. It's big
because of how down we
were. And honestly, I told
them that this team is just
better than us.
"But that doesn't mean
that we can't still win it."

they're doing."I
Freshman Stephen op-
kins was the first to spell usual
starters Smith and Shaw, andt
le began on the right foot. But a 
late first quarter fumble had him 
benched for quite some time.
When Toussaint got his
chance late midway through
the fourth quarter, he brokeI
through the line of scrimmage'
for a 6-yard run- bfore he was n
caught from behild on the five- i
yard line. Toussaint didn't play a
in the first three games of the<
season because of a knee injury.'
Jackson doesn't think that he's
back to full strength jist yet. 1
"You usually don't catch him
from beh ind, I'll put it that way,"
Jackson said. "Fitz can run."
Cox also broke a long run 
of his own. Ite finished aith
56 yards on just six carries-
including a 35yard dash.
It remains to be seen whether r
six different ruining backs wril
receive carries when Big Ten
plao starts next week. But with
a large lead in hand, ichiganI
gave a few of its runners some
valuable experience.
With Robinson out oflthe game

You just wanna keep hearing that."
Forcier looked like he hadn't
missed a beat from his 4-0 start
last season. On his first drive, the
quarterback marched the Wolver-
ines 69 yards in 10 plays to score on
a two-yard run by junior Michael
Shaw. The touchdown gave Michi-
gan a 14-point lead at halftime.
"At halftime, we weren't real
happy," Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez said after the game.
"We were happy with what we
could do, but we weren't happy
with the score."
One thing Michigan had no
trouble doingwas runningthe ball.
Rodriguez played six different
running backs and got significant
contributions from five of them.
On Michigan's first offensive
drive of the second half, Shaw and
sophomore Vincent Smith com-
bined to run the ball eight out of
Michigan's 10 plays on the drive,
which culminated in a play-action
pass from Forcier to redshirt
junior fullback John McColgan.
And after an interception by
senior linebacker Jonas Mouton
on the next drive, the Wolverines
scored easily on an eight-yard run
by Smith, the first of his two touch-
downs on the day.
In the fourth quarter, Michi-
gan fans got their first glimpse of
redshirt freshman running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint, and he didn't
disappoint. On his very first carry
as a Wolverine, the Youngstown,
Ohio native burst through the
Bowling Green defense for 61
yards before being brought downo
from behind. He ran the next play
in for the touchdown.
That long run put Toussaint
ahead of Michigan's two premiere
backs - Smith and Shaw had 62
and 59 yards, respectively, while
Toussaint ended up with 66. Red-
shirt sophomore Mike Cox had 56

Robinson down the road.
"'When you can line 03 and
run the football, y0 oLoo 11up
the passing lanes for throwing
and you open up so much more,"
quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said.
INJURY UPDATE: With
another game came another
Robinson injury scare.
Near the end of a 46-yard
roun doWnl the left sideline, Rob-
inson was cauglot from beh ind
and tackled out of bounds. He
came down hard on h is left knee.
When Robinson came out of the
locker room to start the second
half, loe had the knee heavily
wrapped and was seen jogging
ol thesidelines.
"Ie's fine," Smith said. "Ile
just banged himself up a little
bit oo bthat last run. IIe actually
could've went back in. But We
decided not to, let hin rest the
rest of the half and then if we
needed to come back with him
we cooold."
Shaw also injured himself
blocking down field for Vincent
Smith. .fter the game, Rodri-
golez soeaid lie was fine.

yards of his own, as well.
"All the guys just have their own
skill set," redshirt freshman left
tackle Taylor Lewan said after the
game. "Shaw's really quick, Fitz
just has a hard edge, it's all good.
These guys are playing really well,
and I'm excited to see what they'll
do the rest of the season."
Lewan, who was made a starter
this week after backingup redshirt
junior Mark Huyge the first three
games of the season, played every
offensive snap until seven minutes
remained in the fourth quarter.
The win makes Michigan 4-0
for the second straight year. But
Rodriguez said this team feels dif-
ferent from last year, when it fol-
lowed its hot start by losing seven
of its last eightgames.
"We're deeper on offense, for
sure," Rodriguez said. "We're

deeper at just about every position
offensively. Last year was last year
and this is a completely different
year."
Seeing Forcier at the podium
after the game was a throwback
to last year. The sophomore was
great, finishing a record 12-for-12
through the air for 110 yards and a
touchdown.
The game showcased all three
of Michigan's quarterbacks and
all three played very well. Overall,
Rodriguez was happy with what
he saw.
"Against Bowling Green and
what we were doing today, I
thought all three quarterbacks
were very efficient," Rodriguez
said. "The neat part for us is that
all three of those guys have not
hit their ceiling yet. Not even
close."

The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Spread-o-Meter measures the success of quarterbacks, the Rod-o-Meter

Two of the three quarterbacks threw for touch-
downs, and two ran for scores. If that's not
what dual-threat quarterbacks are supposed
to do, then we don't know what is. Together,
the trio passed for 255 yards and ran for 184.

Rich Rods

At the podium on Saturday, Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez was all business. Yes, his team is 4-0
through the non-conference slate, but the third-
year coach has been here before. He knows wins
over MAC teams don't guarantee Big Ten success.

' 4 From the weak rendition of The Victors after the win to
the rows of empty seats, the fans didn't seem to appreci-
ate the 4-0 start. People were filing out of the Stadium in
Big Houses droves beginning at halftime, particularly students. The
one redeeming factor: the well-executed double wave.
