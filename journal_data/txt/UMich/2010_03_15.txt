Business leaders,
experts say more
help is still needed to
transform economy
By CHRISTOPHERPHOTIADES
For the Daily
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm unveiled new plans last
month to stimulate Michigan's
economy by providing financial
assistance to small business own-
ers - and local business owners
and experts say they think her
plans will be beneficial, but more
assistance is still needed.
One of Granholm's new pro-
grams is the Michigan Small
Business Financing Alliance, a
consortium of 30 credit unions
that have agreed to make $43 mil-
lion in capital available to small
businesses. In addition to the
Financing Alliance, Granholm also
announced that the state would
provide funding for the FastTrac
program, which offers aspiring
entrepreneurs the opportunity to
learn how to start their own busi-
nesses.
The Financing Alliance intends
to help current small business

owners and aspiring entrepre-
neurs by giving out loans that aver-
age about $20,000.
State Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann
Arbor) said in an interview last
month that she thinks the Financ-
ing Alliance will bringsome much-
needed help to small businesses in
Washtenaw County during a tough
economic time.
"I think at this point in time it is
a very important proposal," Brater
said.
Tom Porter, adjunct lecturer
of Entrepreneurial Studies in the
Ross School of Business, also said
he believes the program will be
beneficial for businesses because
many small businesses are having
trouble obtaining credit in the cur-
rent financial crisis.
"Throughout the country in
the last couple of years, allbusi-
nesses have found it difficult to
obtain credit," Porter said. "(This
program) seems like a program
designed to help smaller business-
es get the kind of credit that they
probably used to get from their
banks."
Brater said she has heard from
many small business owners in her
district who are having problems
obtaining loans.
"(Small business owners) have

Students voice
concern over impact
of statewide ban
By JENNIFER DOMINGUE
For the Daily
University administrators spoke
to students and discussed their
concerns about the impact of a

statewide civil rights initiative
passed in 2006 called Proposal 2,
which banned the use of affirma-
tive action in admissions for public
universities in Michigan, on cam-
pus at an event on Friday.
The open panel discussion,
called "The Rise and Fall of Affir-
mative Action," was hosted by the
National Society of Black Engi-
neers and outlined the history of
affirmative action, its impact on

the University and how it may
shape the future of academics.
The panelists - including Uni-
versity deans and vice provosts
- addressed a crowd of about 70
individuals and invited an open
dialogue with students in the
audience about their undergradu-
ate experiences at the University.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director
of undergraduate admissions,

told those at the event that Pro-
posal 2 caused a lot of controversy
because it led people to believe
that when the University was
using affirmative action in admis-
sions decisions it was accepting
unqualified students.
"One of the misconceptions
of Proposal 2 was that we were
admitting unqualified people," he
said. "That simply wasn't true."

A DIFFERENT KIND OF MEDICAL SCHOOL

Officials: Decreased

increased interest in
osteopathic medicine
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
LSA senior Elyse Rosenthal
always intended to apply to a tra-
ditional - or allopathic - medical
s hool. It wasn't until months into
her senior year at the University
That she discovered an alternative
way to pursue a medical career:
stiudying osteopathic medicine.
- Now Rosenthal is scrapping her
Original plans in favor of going to
a different type of medical school
that takes a more holistic approach

and spirit as well as the body.
Rosenthal said she considers her
discovery of osteopathic medicine
a "twist of fate" because, for her,
it is an ideal way to practice medi-

"(The) philosophy and mission
statements of all the osteopathic
schools are exactly how I think
practicing medicine should be,"

osteopathic medicine, a relatively
new practice that emphasizes
the role of the muscular skeletal
system in overall patient health.
Though the University doesn't
have a osteopathy program, it is
among the top feeder schools in
the nation in the number of stu-
dents who enter the field.
However, in recent years the
percentage of students interest-
ed in osteopathic medicine has
increased substantially, according
to medical school experts.
Gina Moses, associate direc-
tor of application services with
the American Association of Col-
leges of Osteopathic Medicine
(AACOM), said more students are
applying to osteopathy schools
across the nation every year.
"We've seen about an 11.9-per-
cent increase, while interest in MD
schools is pretty much flat-lining,"
she said.
According to the AACOM, the
University is the second highest
feeder school in terms of students
applying to and matriculating at
osteopathic medical schools.
David Brawn, associate direc-
tor for continuing student services
and pre-health advisor at the Uni-
versity, wrote in e-mail interview
that within the last three years,
the number of students interested
in osteopathic medicine at the Uni-
versity has increased.

Sites match job
seeking students to

By SARA BOBOLTZ
For the Daily
When LSA senior Philip Austin
began his job search, he started
looking for a position in Michi-

gan. But much to his dismay, it
was difficult to find a paying job
in the state - a challenge many
graduating seniors looking to
secure employment in Michigan
are facing.
"As my job search has pro-
gressed, it has become much
more likely that I'm going to end
up working somewhere out-of-
state," Austin said.
To counter this problem, many

in the state are developing web-
sites that aim to connect gradu-
ates of Michigan colleges with
employers here.
Lynne Sebille-White, senior

sity's Career Center, said Austin

Starting Aug.1, 2010,trans-
gender students at Harvard
University will be able to
receive insurance coverage
through Harvard's student
insurance plan for sex transi-
tion treatments includingsur-
geries and hormone therapy,
according to a March 11 arti-
cle in The Harvard Crimson.
According to the article,
sex hormones have been
covered under Harvard's
insurance plan since 2006.
However, in an effort to be
more welcoming toward all
groups of students on cam-
pus, the insurance policy will
now cover sexual reassign-
ment surgeries.

for the Transgender Legal
Defense and Education Fund,

vard's University Health Ser-

vices to get the policy passed.
Lewis told The Crimson
that he knows firsthand the
improvement in health that
follows gender reassignment
treatments.
"For those who want them,
hormones and surgery allow
transsexual people to feel
comfortable in their bodies
for the first time," Lewis said
in the article.
ASU TEAM IMPROVES
CHEMICAL DETECTION
A team of Arizona State
University scientists, led by
N.J. Tao of the ASU Biodesign
Institute, has developed a new
method to detect trace chemi-
cals, the ASU News reported.
According to the article, this
new technology can be used
in areas concerning human

health and national security.
This new technology -
electrochemical imaging
microscopy - has proved to
be more advantageous than
previous methods of chemi-
cal detection. The article
reported that Tao and his
team were able to detect and
identify particles of dynamite
weighing less than a billionth
of a gram on the ridges of a
fingerprint.
WMU INSTALLS NEW
ALERT SYSTEM
Western Michigan Uni-
versity installed a new emer-
gency notification system,
according to a March 11 arti-
cle in the Western Herald.
The system consists of
3,546 indoor and 62 outdoor
speakers that have the abil-

ity to alert students and fac-
ulty about emergencies, like
an active shooter or tornado
warning. The system, which
is activated by WMU police,
will only be used in extreme
emergency situations, the
Herald reported.
According to the article,
the system has been under
construction for a number of
years and was first tested on
March 4.
WMU Emergency Man-
agement Administer Cam
Vossen told the Herald that
students who walk around
campus with headphones on
may not hear alerts, ultimate-
ly making the system less
effective. "We can only help
people as much as they help
themselves," Vossen said in
the article.

As older generations leave the field, osteopathy
sees credibility, number of applicants increase

From Page 1A
who applied to (Doctor of Oste-
opathy) schools in 2007 was 195,
compared to 388 last year," he
wrote.
Moses said the growing inter-
est is due to numerous factors, like
the rising number of osteopathic
schools across the country and the
increase in class sizes within these
schools, among others.
Despite the growth, there are
only 29 Doctor of Osteopathy
degree-granting schools in the
United States, compared with
more than 100 Medical Doctor
degree-granting schools or allo-
pathic medical schools, according
to the 2010 College Information
Book published by the AACOM.
Moses said another explanation
for the increase in applicants is
that osteopathic medicine appeals
more to students beginning their
medical careers today.
"I believe that the millennial
generation is more committed to
the personal aspect of medicine
and patient care, which are the
hallmarks of osteopathic meth-

ods," Moses said.
LSA senior Dustin Harmon said
he plans to attend osteopathic
school in the fall because osteo-
pathic doctors are less likely to rely
on pills and medications as a form
of treatment.
"For a headache, you can crack
(a patient's) neck and set it so that
it alleviates pressure, rather than
just saying, 'Take some ibupro-
fen,"' Harmon said.
Rosenthal said practitioners
who felt the medical profession
was becoming too standardized
and impersonal developed the
field.
"Osteopathic medicine focuses
more on patient history and a lot
of outside factors that should be
incorporated into a person's care
that sometimes aren't," she said.
Though in previous years osteo-
pathic doctors had fewer opportu-
nities to practice their specialty,
Brawn wrote that is no longer the
case.
"DOs have long since gained
rights to practice medicine in all SO
states and in more than 50 differ-
ent countries," he wrote. "The full

range of opportunities is available
in both fields."
Moses said she becomes
"crazed" when she hears "campus
myths" about osteopathic medi-
cine.
"People think they can't special-
ize or practice internationally," she
said. "It's just not true. DOs are not
limited at all."
Currently, osteopathic doctors
can fulfill medical doctorate resi-
dencies and offer the same pre-
scriptions as a medical doctorate.
In addition, Rosenthal said doctor-
ate osteopathic schools and medi-
cal schools have almost identical
curriculums.
"You have the same basic sci-
ence classes, and you take the same
clinical exam," she said. "But then
you also have an extra osteopathic
principle and practicum class that
teaches you how to do exams that
help you to understand the body
with your hands."
Despite the similarities among
the fields, Rosenthal said some
stigmas remain attached to the
field of osteopathic medicine
because it only gained recognition

by the American Medical Associa-
tion in 1969.
"Older generations, like my
grandparents didn't respect it as
much at first," she said.
Mariella Mecozzi, senior assis-
tant director of pre-professional
services at the University, said
stigmas stem from ignorance
about the practice of osteopathic
medicine.
"I think people are often skepti-
cal of what they don't know," she
said.
Mecozzi also said patients
can often be wary of DO doctors
because they believe it is easier
for students to be accepted to DO
schools, but according to Mecozzi,
there is only a slight difference
between the grade point averages
of students accepted to MD and
DO schools nationally.
"The explanation I can give
you is that DO schools pay a lot of
attention to what else the student
brings to the table," she said. "They
look for good GPAs and good let-
ters of recommendation."
She added that the real differ-
ence between MD and DO stu-

dents lies within Medical College
Admission Test scores. According
to Mecozzi, MD students score,
on average, about 30 on the MCAT
- which has a score range from 1
to 45 - while DO students score
about 25 points on average on the
test.
Rosenthal said many of her
friends have begun applying
to both MD and DO schools to
improve their chances of admis-
sion - a trend she believes is help-
ing to dissipate the remnants of
stigmas about osteopathic medi-
cine inherited from older genera-
tions.
"Now that our generation is
starting to learn so much about
it and the generation right above
us is starting to accept it more
because their kids are going to
these schools more often, I think
osteopathic medicine will become
as common as allopathic medi-
cine," she said.
Harmon saidbecause the stigma
associated with osteopathic medi-
cine is disappearing, there's more
camaraderie between allopathic
and osteopathic medical profes-

sionals.
"I don't think there's this huge
barrier that used to exist when
DOs and MDs just thought in com-
pletely different ways," he said.
Mecozzi also said that there is
more unity between the two medi-
cal fields.
"The last few generations of
(MD and DO) doctors have had
more of an opportunity to work
side by side," she said.
Harmon said that regardless of
the way osteopathic medicine is
received in today's world, he still
prefers to attend a DO school.
"I've worked with osteopathic
and MD physicians, and I've shad-
owed both," Harmon said. "You get
to establish a better relationship
with the patient in the long term if
you're an osteopathic physician, in
my opinion."
Mecozzi said eventually, after
the frenzy of applying to medi-
cal schools subsides, the degree
achieved becomes less important
than the skill of the doctor.
"I think there's more to a doc-
tor than the letters behind their
name," she said.

White House
" defends Obama
criticism of Court
The White House yester-
day defended President Barack
Obama's scathing criticism of
a Supreme Court decision that
allows unions and corporations to
funnel unlimited dollars to politi-
cal campaigns.
Senior adviser David Axelrod
and press secretary Robert Gibbs
refused to retreat from criticism
Obama leveled during his State of
the Union address, with six of the
nine members of the court sitting
a few feet in front of him. The two
White House officials defended
Obama's statement that the ruling
was seriously flawed.
"Under the ruling of the Supreme
Court, any lobbyist could go in to
any legislator and say, 'If you don't
vote our way on this bill, we're
going to run a million-dollar cam-
paign against you in your district.'
And that is a threat to our democ-
racy," Axelrod said.
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico
3 with ties to U.S.
government killed
on Mexican border
Three people with ties to the
American consulate were killed in a
drug-plagued Mexican city, includ-
ing a U.S. couple shot to death with-
in sight of the border with their
baby in their back seat, officials said
9 yesterday.
President Barack Obama
expressed outrage over the kill-
ings, and Mexican President Felipe
Calderon promised a swift investi-
gation.
Several U.S. citizens have been
killed in Mexico's drug war, most
of them people with family ties
to Mexico. However, it is rare for
American government employees
to he targeted.
The three died during a particu-
larly bloody weekend in Mexico,
with nearly 50 people killed in
apparent drug-gang violence. Nine
people were killed in a gang shoot-
out early yesterday in the Pacific
resort city of Acapulco, one of Mex-
ico's spring break attractions.

The U.S. consulate employee and
her husband were shot to death Sat-
urday in their car near the Santa Fe
international bridge linking Ciu-
dad Juarez with El Paso, Texas,
said Vladimir Tuexi, a spokesman
for Chihuahua state prosecutors'
office.
Their baby was found unharmed
in the back seat. Tuexi estimated
the child was about 1 year old.

Hoax news report

Georgians have been panicked

ident Mikhail Saakashvili.
Russia and Georgia fought a
brief but bloody war in 2008, a

of Georgians who have since seen
two de facto independent prov-
inces erect firm borders.
The private television station
Imedi - Georgia's No. 3 channel
showed the faux report Satur-

A few media outlets picked up
on the story, and the channel ran a
ticker during a subsequent enter-
tainment show stating the report
"did not correspond with reality."
There was no explanation.

Although she added that law-
makers were "on the verge of
making history."
She also dismissed criticism
by House GOP leader John Boeh-

want to stay in Michigan post-
graduation but, despite their
interest in staying in-state, many
find jobs elsewhere.
To find a job in Michigan,
Sebille-White said it takes "net-
working" and "dedication." She
described how many students are
forced to look for jobs outside the
state, which contributes to the
much-discussed "brain drain"
phenomenon.
"It depends upon field and area
of expertise and where you want
to live," she said. "Certainly every
state is suffering (from the econ-
omy), but Michigan, obviously, is
sufferingmore."
University alum James Wahls,
who is president of DetroitInt-
ern.com, LLC, wrote in an e-mail
interview that his website is "a
response to the young profes-
sional brain drain that is affect-
ing Metro Detroit," and added
that the website provides access
to internships, job opportunities
and career resources.
Wahls founded DetroitIntern.
com in 2006, which has since
grown to include 10 major cities,
including New York City, Chicago
and Atlanta. Each city has its own
internship and job-posting site
operating under the DetroitInt-
ern network.
. Wahls said expanding Detroi-
tIntern to other cities has pro-
vided economic opportunities
for Michigan because it helps "to
virtually link Detroit's businesses
and workforce with other major
metropolitan areas."
Wahls and his business part-
ner Tarik Green, also a University
alum, are working with Idealist.
org to further expand the number
of job listings on DetroitIntern
into the thousands.
More than 3,000 students and
professionals are currently regis-
tered with DetroitIntern, most of

whom reside in Michigan and the
Midwest. Nearly 40 Michigan
colleges and universities direct
students to the site via their
career services websites, accord-
ing to Wahls.
InternInMichigan.com is a
state-wide initiative that is a
partnership of government enti-
ties and other organizations that
aims to attract college graduates
to the state.
Jennifer Goodin, spokeswom-
an for Intern In Michigan, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
goal of the site is "to connect cur-
rent college students and recent
graduates seeking internships
with Michigan-based employers
looking to hire them."
More than 10,000 students are
registered with Intern In Michi-
gan - about 1,250 of which attend
the University of Michigan,
according to Goodin.
Another resource, available
exclusively to University stu-
dents, is the Career Center Con-
nector - a job posting site linked

House Democratic leaders are
pressing for a vote on their bill as
early as this coming week.
The legislation would pro-
vide health care to tens of mil-
lions who currently lack it. It
would require almost everyone
to obtain coverage and subsidize
the cost of premiums for poor
and middle-income Americans.
It would also ban insurance
companies from denying cover-
age on the basis of pre-existing
conditions.
The health care bill appeared
to be on the verge of passing in
early January before Democrats
lost a special election in Massa-
chusetts to fill the seat of the late
Edward M. Kennedy and with it,
their filibuster-proof majority in
the Senate.
In the weeks since, the White
House and Democrats have
embarked on a rescue strategy
that would require the House to
pass legislation that cleared the
Senate in December before both
houses approve a second bill that
makes changes to the first.
But some anti-abortion Demo-
crats in the House have balked
at the bill, and it's not clear they
will vote for final passage. The
bill needs 216 votes to clear the
House.
on the center's website. Many of
the postings include jobs in Mich-
igan and users are able to search
for jobs by location.
University alum Vinal Desai
utilized job posting websites like
the Career Center Connector
in her pursuit for a job last year.
Desai wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that she recently found a job
at Google's headquarters in Ann
Arbor.
While Desai wrote that she
might leave the state for graduate
school in the future, she said she
knew she wanted to stay in Mich-
igan for a while after completing
her undergraduate degree. '
"Michigan is my home," she
wrote. "Having grown up here,
I have a strong support system of
family and friends. This support
system has been invaluable to me
throughout the transition period
followinggraduation."
Margaret Dewar, professor of
Urban and Regional Planning at
the University, wrote in an e-mail
interview that she thinks Michi-
gan's weak economy is to blame
for the "brain drain."
She added that these websites
and other resources are ways
companies in the state are look-
ing to boost Michigan's economy.
Despite some of the new job
opportunities, she wrote that her
students have been struggling to
find jobs in Michigan.
"My students would love to
stay here," she said. "They can't
because they have to find jobs,
and this region has few. They
hold out for a job here as long as
they can, but finally, they have to
go elsewhere."
LSA senior Joseph Holberg
said the University's Department
of Economics helped him find a
job via e-mails sent to students in
the program.
He said that not only would he
be willing to take a position out-
of-state in order to secure a job,
but if he were presented with two
equal job opportunities - one in

Michigan and one out-of-state -
he would most likely not choose
the one in Michigan.
"I would like to accumulate an
array of experiences in terms of
location," he said.
Sebille-White said she thinks
the "brain drain" is partly caused
by students looking to live in an
environment with a large young-
er professional population like
New York City or Chicago.
"There are a lot of different
cultural opportunities, social
opportunities and some of the
things that make living attractive
(in larger cities)," she said.
Sebille-White also noted that
while online job posting boards
are helpful, students may not
want to rely solely on those
resources.
"Probably a good 70 percent
of jobs that are available at any
given time are never advertised -
they're filled by word of mouth,"
she said. "So if you're not con-
nected, you may not know about
those opportunities."

cash flow issues, and this program
is designed to help give relief to
small businesses that are having
trouble getting their loans that
they used to get quite routinely
(and) are now drying up," Brater
said. "I think this a good proposal
and will be effective."
Amer Bathish, owner of Amer's
Deli, said he likes the concept
of the Financing Alliance, but
$20,000 is not enough money to
help an established business like
his.
"I would need more for float
money, like $50,000 to $100,000,"
Bathish said. "$20,000 will not
take you far."
Bathish said if he received a
loan from the Financing Alliance,
he would use the money to make
improvements in his restaurants
instead of hiring more employees.
Bathish said government assis-
tance to Ann Arbor businesses
should help with sky-high rent
costs because he and other local
business owners are paying large
sums on rent.
Bathish said he is paying
$15,000 a month for his State
Street restaurant location and
compared the price to rent in
downtown New York City.
"The rent in this town is abso-
lutely ridiculous," he said. "Why
are we paying Manhattan rent for
little Ann Arbor?"
He added that unlike New York,
Ann Arbor businesses only make
revenue when students are in
town, which is only seven months
out of the year.
Village Apothecary owner
Garry Turner said Financing Alli-
ance program is a "step in the
right direction" and that he would
consider taking a loan from the
program for his drug store. But he
said the program is not enough,
adding that he thinks public poli-
cies should focus on relieving the
tax burden on small businesses.
"I think there are a lot of busi-
nesses, small and large, in the state
that are holding back hiring right
now because there are a lot of costs
involved," Turner said.
EVENT
From Page 1A
Since the ballot initiative
passed in 2006, the percentage
of underrepresented minority
students in incoming freshmen
classes at the University has
declined every year. In the fall
semester of 2005, 812 under-
represented minority students
enrolled as freshmen at the Uni-
versity. The number declined to
604 students who enrolled in
fall 2009, and this year's under-
represented minority enrollment
fell 11.4 percent from last year to
535 students.
James Holloway, associate
dean for the College of Engineer-
ing, spoke about the history of
affirmative action and specifi-
cally the 2006 ballot initiative.
Holloway said Proposal 2 has
placed limitations on the Univer-
sity and has made it harder for
the University to attract under-
represented minority students.
"In terms of applications and
admits, we are close to where we
were in 2005," Holloway said.

"In terms of getting those stu-
dents to come, it is getting more
and more difficult."
other panelists who spoke at

Turner suggested that the state
should provide a tax credit for
each newly hired employee to help
offset the cost of training and new
payroll taxes - an idea he thinks
would help both current business-
es and aspiring entrepreneurs.
Kyle Mazurek, vice president
of government affairs for the Ann
Arbor Area Chamber of Com-
merce; which recently merged
with the Ypsilanti Area Chamber
of Commerce, said he also thinks
that reformingtaxes is a necessary
step to help small businesses, but
that lawmakers should take a dif-
ferent approach.
"The goal of many state-wide,
small business associations is to
develop a more competitive tax
structure," Mazurek said.
Mazurek said he knows many
small business owners are con-
cerned about taxes - citing the
22-percent surcharge on the
Michigan Business Tax as a pri-
mary concern.
But Porter, the lecturer, said he
thinks reducing the tax burdens
on small businesses is unrealistic
given the state's current economic
situation.
"Reducing the tax burden (on
business) is always a good idea,
but given the realities of our gov-
ernments ... we have to be honest
about their financial condition
and where they're going to get the
capital to meet all the needs of the
citizens," he said. "I don't think
it's realistic to think about reduc-
ing taxes."
Porter added that the lack of
access to credit - which is what
Granholm's program is aiming to
address - hampers small busi-
nesses from expanding more than
the burden of taxes.
Mazurek, the official from the
Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce,
said he also thinks unobtainable
credit is specifically preventing
small businesses from expand-
ing, but that the Financing Alli-
ance program will "significantly
improve small business access to
capital."
"One of the barriers is access to
capital, and (businesses) are find-
ing that traditional institutions
just don't have capital available to
them or aren't willing to lend it,"
the event included Lester Monts,
senior vice provost for Academic
Affairs, John Matlock, director
of the Office of Academic Mul-
ticultural initiatives, Sharon
Burch, director of Undergradu-
ate Recruitment Initiatives and
Derrick Scott, program director
of the Multicultural Engineering
Programs Office.
At the talk, students contrib-
uted to the discussion - giv-
ing advice to the panelists, and
expressing concerns about the
University's academic and social
environment.
One student said the Univer-
sity should implement a program
to educate students about vari-
ous multicultural issues. Anoth-
er student proposed a system to
track students' educational prog-
ress to prevent students from
"falling through the cracks."
Many minority students at the
event agreed that after the pas-
sage of Proposal 2, they have felt
like they have had to prove their
academic potential to theit peers
and professors.
Students also expressed sur-
prise by the levels of admis-

sion and matriculation rates for

Mazurek said.
Mazurek added that he hopes
Financing Alliance "will be a win-
win for small businesses" and that
Ann Arbor area businesses will
take advantage of the program.
In addition to the Financing
Alliance, Granholm announced
state funding for FastTrac, which
will be run by The Ewing Marion
Kauffman Foundation in partner-
ship with Wayne State University's
TechTown program. It's expected
that the program will be offered at
12 small business assistance cen-
ters throughout the state.
Michigan Economic Develop-
ment Corporation - an organiza-
tion created through a partnership
between state and local govern-
ments - is expected to provide
$200,000 for 1,000 entrepreneurs
to attend FastTrac.
Brater said FastTrac will help
to expand start-up companies in
Washtenaw County, adding that
the program will also benefit the
area's universities.
Mazurek said he thinks Fast-
Trac isthe type of program that is
necessary to help rebound Michi-
gan's economy.
"The conventional wisdom at
the Chamber (is that) the key to
Michigan's economic recovery
is going to be jump-starting our
entrepreneurial spirit and encour-
aging small businesses' growth,"
Maurek said. "My understand-
ing of this program is that it is
designed to do exactly that by giv-
ing would-be entrepreneurs the
training they need to be success-
ful."
But some, like Porter, still
believe Granholm's initiatives to
help small businesses don't go far
enough to create new jobs and
transform Michigan's economy.
"Public policy must aim to
replace (the lost jobs) and creating
a new economy in Michigan," Por-
ter said. "I think if we're trying to
replace the automotive companies
that have pulled out of the state,
and if we're to be competitive as a
state ... we need to have a knowl-
edge-based economy to establish
new companies and industries,
and Michigan will need much
more substantial programs than
(those outlined by the governor)'
underrepresented minority stu-
dents at the University.
Business senior Julia Hawley
said in an interview after the
event that she felt low matricula-
tion rates for minority students
were cause for concern.
"I think that one of the most
important discussions today was
not only the admissions, but also
the matriculation rates," Hawley
said. "I think that this is some-
thing that not only the adminis-
tration needs to work on, but the
student body needs to be aware of
as well."
College of Engineering junior
Aisha Harris, an organizer of the
event, said in an interview after
the discussion that she felt com-
pelled to raise awareness about
affirmative action and Proposal
2's effects because the issues
have not had much attention in
recent years.
"My class was the last one to
come in with affirmative action,"
Harris said. "There were a lot of
years of silence and people had a

lot to say. I wanted to give that
opportunity to people - a com-
munication between the Univer-
sity and its students."

MSA's website mismanagement violates trust
t's hard to know where to even begin discussing the Michi-
gan Student Assembly's most recent disappointment. Last
week, MSA President Abhishek Mahanti announced that
MSA had drastically exceeded its budget to repair and update its
website, which has long been in need of update. MSA spent an
appalling $9,000 on graphic and web designers, though it bud-
geted only $3,000 for the project. Not only did MSA mismanage
its funds, it isn't even using the website it spent $9,000 attempt-
ing to fix. MSA has failed to justify the trust that students place
in it to spend their money wisely, and it has a responsibility to
monitor its use of funds more closely in the future.

On Monday, Jim Brusstar, MSA's stu-
dent general counsel, sent an e-mail to
MSA representatives that said that MSA
had overspent its website redesign budget
by about $6,000. At the MSA meeting on
Tuesday, Mahanti took responsibility for
the mistake, saying that he was unaware
of how many hours designers had spent
working on the website. He apologized
to the assembly and promised to fix the
problem. He said that the website, which
he has been leading efforts to repair since
April, had more problems than he and the
web designers were capable of fixing. That
website has since been abandoned. Brus-
star has now been placed in charge of the
project. MSA Engineering Representative
Kyle Summers built the site that MSA is
currently using for free, according to Sum-
mers.
Mahanti's excuses and apologies have
come too late. To be entirely clear, MSA
spent $9,000 of the money it gets from
students on a product that, despite hours
of work, failed to function correctly. It
essentially spent $9,000 on nothing. And
since the website currently in use - which
is functional, if admittedly simple - was
created for free, it's suspect that MSA
originally budgeted $3,000 for the project
in the first place. The amount of money
that was wasted on the failed website is
absurd.
Allocating funding to student groups
is MSA's primary responsibility, so it's
alarming that the organization so dra-
matically failed to manage its own financ-
es. While the assembly did dole out more
money to student groups this semester
than ever before, that money still comes
from students and most be used properly
in all situations. Students should be able to
trust the student government to respon-
sibly handle the money they contribute.
MSA's failure to manage students' money
has violated the trust between the assem-

bly and the students it serves.
Much of the responsibility for this mess
falls squarely on Mahanti. MSA's web-
site has been a consistent problem over
the years, and a number of MSA presi-
dents have campaigned on promises to
fix it - Mahanti chief among them. And
as a computer science engineering major,
Mahanti should have been uniquely quali-
fied among MSA representatives to actu-
ally make good on the promise. But this
fiasco is representative of a much larger
problem. The oversight of big projects is a
central part of Mahanti's position as presi-
dent. Mahanti's failure to manage a project
for which he took personal responsibility
calls into question his ability to lead MSA.
But the rest of MSA must share some of
the blame for this debacle. MSA represen-
tatives should have questioned the lag in
progress on the website, which was sup-
posed to have been ready for use in the fall.
Had the lack of results been challenged
earlier, the excess costs of labor may have
been noticed sooner. But there was no
oversight from the assembly, and so the
problem was unaddressed for months as
the costs piled up.
MSA exists to improve student life on
campus, and the assembly has repeatedly
failed at fulfilling this role. This event is
sure to stick in students' memories, along
with the meeting last year when MSA
wasted hours discussing a resolution on
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, over which
it has no jurisdiction. Pledges to work with
the Ann Arbor City Council to improve
off-campus lighting continue to go unful-
filled. The failed website is a testament to
MSA's ongoing incompetence.
At the end of the day, this project was
simply a disaster. And MSA has a respon-
sibility to students to make sure that simi-
lar failures don't happen in the future.
Students trust MSA with their money, and
MSA must pay students back with results.

'd seen Ann Arbor business-
man Rick Snyder's TV ads for
his gubernatorial run for sev-
eral weeks, but I
had tuned him out
entirely - I just
don't believe elec-
tions are some-
thing we should
be perpetually
worried about.
Over spring break,A
I finally took the
time to tune into IMRAN
the hype. SE
Snyder wore SYED
me down. While
the Republican
primary in which Snyder is among a
handful of strong candidates is still
months away, I can't deny any lon-
ger that this upcoming gubernatorial
election is Michigan's most impor-
tant in recent memory, and Snyder is
more than just an instigator - he's a
game changer.
As the earliest, and easily the most
eager participant in this race, it's easy
to dismiss Snyder as a distraction
rather than an attraction - like, say,
Dennis Kucinich or Ron Paul in the
last presidential election. His "one
tough nerd" ads do have all the mak-
ings of a sham, but Michigan's vot-
ers have nothing to lose by tuning in.
And so I did.
Snyder claims to be different from
the established politicians that oth-
erwise populate the field on hope-
fuls for both major parties in this
election. In that, he is being entirely
truthful. Republicans Mike Cox and
Peter Hoekstra, and Democrats Virg
Bernero and Andy Dillon - the front-
runners of their respective parties
- are what we'd call career politi-
cians. While I disagree with Snyder
that that's always bad, given the dire
straits Michigan is in economically,
it's understandable that this state's
electorate has been outright apathet-
ic about this election as long as those

were the only names we heard.
But ever since Snyder has become a
prominent player, interest in the elec-
tion has deepened. Snyder has started
the right conversation, and I see that
as just as important an accomplish-
ment as actually becoming elected
and succeeding as governor. Snyder
has forced the other candidates to
abandon tired platitudes engrained in
traditional party platforms and begin
to talk about real concerns of the
people of this state - and believe me,
those have very little to do with how
a candidate feels about gay marriage.
Icmaintain that Ga. Jennifer Gra-
nholm's failures, especially over the
past couple of years, have been fail-
ures of circumstance. Nevertheless,
it's becoming harder and harder to
deny that she might have been the
wrong leader for the time. Snyder is
an accomplished businessman, who
may very well be exactly what this
state needs to lead it back toward
prosperity. Even so, it's important to
snoop a little deeper to understand
what this man really stands for. For
one thing, even Snyder's campaign
ads invite voters to do so. r
I looked through the mountain on
information on Snyder's campaign
website and was pleasantly surprised
to see that he actually seemed to have
done his homework. I think it's safe to
say that no student has to time to read
through all of the detailed "white
papers" on his website outlining the
candidate's full plans for issues like
regulatory reform, youth retention
in the state, the environment and the
state's education system. So, I decid-
ed to pick out and read through one
white paper on a topic'that especially
interested me: the development and
revitalization of Michigan's central
cities.
Snyder certainly says all the right
things here. Asaresident of Michigan
who plans to stay in the state after
gettingmy law degree, Iwas happyto
see echoed in hiswhite paper many

of my own concerns. Many talented
young people come to this state to
receive a world-class education at
this University, and yet none of them
end up staying. The reason for this
is that there simply isn't the social,
business and commercial infrastruc-
ture in place in Michigan's cities
to attract young people who havea
choice about where to live and work.
Snyder might be
what Michigan's
economy needs.
That Snyder recognizes this prob-
lem is itself a huge first step, and
separates him by miles from his oppo-
nents in the Republican primary, who
remain tied to tired political games
of blaming the Democrats, blaming
Granholm, or better yet, blaming
President Barack Obama. But recog-
nizing isn't enough, because we've
heard Granholm talk about these
problems before too. The advantage
Snyder has is that he approaches the
state's problems as an outsider, who
is not tied to any traditional way of
political maneuvering. Where Gran-
holm had enough political capital to
talk and do nothing more, Snyder, if
elected, would have the mandate to
act as well.
Snyder wants Michigan's voters
to know that he is among those rare
people who will be the right leader at
the right time. Every candidate says
this, but reading into what Snyder
stands for, and knowing what I know
about the state's economic and social
atmosphere, I think there might be
something to what this guy says.

LAURA VEITH I
Collaborative volunteering

Most students at the University spend
approximately eight months of the year on
campus. During this period, most of us, includ-
ing me, spend a significant amount of time
focused on our classes and schoolwork. And
while it is important to maintain a focus on our
education, we shouldn't forget about giving
back to the state that houses us for the major-
ity of the year - or even longer for in-state stu-
dents. As most students are aware, Michigan is
in a state of economic turmoil. With the state
budget suffering massive cutbacks - especially
in education - and the highest unemployment
rate in the country, students should take a
break from their studies and start helping out
our community.
Unfortunately, University service organiza-
tions are facing a similar plight. Though the
Daily reported that MSA intends to increase
the monetary funds given to student groups
this semester (MSA boosts fundingfor students
orgs this semester, 03/09/2010), many groups
still feel constrained. To combat this issue, sev-
eral community service organizations turned
their individual efforts into collaborative ser-
vice projects. Collaborative initiatives, like
K-nection and OneMichigan, bring together
multiple University service groups to promote
community service and attract volunteers to
participate in group projects.
Of course, student volunteers won't be able
to decrease unemployment or fix the budget,
but we can still contribute to the improvement
of the state and the University community.
With only six weeks left until the end of the
semester, now more than ever is an opportune
time for students to get involved in service
projects sponsored by programs like K-nection
and OneMichigan.
K-nection, which holds signups for service
projects today in Mason Hall, is an initiative
started by Do Random Acts of Kindness (more
commonly known as DoRAK), Circle K and
K-Grams. I've been a member of K-Grams over
a year. These groups, each of which individu-
ally focuses on different aspects of community
service, came together in January with the
concept of K-nection. According to K-Grams
Executive Director, Haley Gire, K-nection is

not only a way for the groups to save on the
cost of service projects, but also an opportuni-
ty to support the community service efforts of
other organizations. In an interview with me,
Gire noted, "With the increase in recent cuts to
school budgets and international catastrophes,
it seemed like the best time to start working
together."
This collaborative endeavor is an admi-
rable initiative by the three groups. In a time
of financial struggle, I find it rewarding to see
groups coming up with creative solutions to
their budgetary problems. Individually, these
three groups participate in a range of service
projects that contribute to the improvement of
the University and state. Now that the groups
are collaborating for a common cause, their
impact on the University community will be
even greater.
In addition to the benefit of this collab-
orative effort, K-nection allows the groups to
attract new volunteers and initiate new expe-
riences, which further add to the success of
their service projects. Students need to real-
ize the importance of this event and contrib-
ute to these community service organizations'
efforts to help the University and the state.
More students must recognize this potential
and get involved.
But K-nection is not the only organization on
campus that focuses on collaborative service
projects. On Apr. 9, OneMichigan plans to hold
a day honoring community service on the Diag.
With over 40 participating organizations, the
day will be devoted to educating and recruit-
ing students to their initiatives. The event will
also allow students to learn about the goals and
actions of the various community service clubs
and organizations on campus. Their attempt to
increase the support and awareness of service
projects in the community could prove to be
extremely important to their progress.
Students should attend and contribute to
these events in order to help improve and aid
the well-being of the University and the state.
We need to make the most of the eight months
we are here.

made a bowl game,
and the basketball e
team earned its
first NCAA Tour-
nament bid in COURTNEY
t1 years just last RATKOVIAK
season. But when
you're only at one
of the premier
sports schools in the nation for four
years, that time is too short to tol-
erate multiple mediocre seasons in
every major sport.
So when Ohio State's Evan Turner
made that ridiculous, 37-foot buzzer-
beater on Friday afternoon to knock
the Wolverines out of the Big Ten
Tournament and end their season,
another loss wasn't even heartbreak-
ing anymore.
All I could think was: Of course he
did that. Story of my senior year.
It's no secret that many students
choose to come here because of the
athletic tradition. And it's easy to feel
like this year, we've been robbed of
the chance to experience that win-
ning feeling that's supposed to define
students' time at the University.
But for some overly optimistic rea-
son, I still kept buying tickets to bas-
ketball and hockey games this winter.
That's because I knew that regardless
of the games' outcomes, my experi-
ence as a University student would
have been much less fulfilling if I
hadn't been there in the stands.
And that's why it was only natural
that one day after Turner's demoral-
izing shot, a friend and I decided to
drive to East Lansing and watch yet

another Michigan team that has failed
to meet expectations all year. The trip
felt like a good idea as soon as Michi-
gan scored two goals partway through
the first period. But then the Wolver-
ines allowed three quick Spartan goals
to fall behind at the first intermission.
All I could think was: Ofcourse they
did that. Story of my senior year.
But this time, Michigan decided to
fight back - and pulled out a 5-3 win.
As the large Michigan contingent
stayed in the Munn Ice Arena stands
long past the end of the game, chant-
ing, "It's great to be a Michigan Wol-
verine," I knew that's why Ihave kept
watching the disappointments - for
the feeling of those few successes.
My friend that went with me to
Saturday's game has never'held sea-
son tickets at Yost and doesn't con-
sider herself a diehard hockey fan. But
when we decided to go to Michigan
State on Saturday, she easily shelled
out the $25 for a ticket and drove 120
miles round trip to go see them.
When I asked her why she wanted
to go, she was taken aback, like it was
a stupid question. And her reason was
simple.
"I'm a senior," she said. "I had a
chance to see one of our teams find
success, and I wanted to be a partof it."
That's the exact same reason anoth-
er one of my friends gave after we con-
vinced her to go to the outdoor Camp
Randall Hockey Classic game back in
February. The trip to Madison was
more expensive and a lot farther away
than East Lansing, and she decided to
go even though she can only name two
players on the current hockey roster.
The weather was frigid, we couldn't
see what was happening on the ice
even though we were in the third row
of seats, and we wandered around
Madison for a half hour after the game
trying to figure out where we had
parked. By the time we finally found
our car and escaped the elements,
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

she was numb, near tears and having
absolutely no fun.
But she knew that part of the fun-
damental idea of being a Michigan.
student means going to sporting
events and learning about our teams
- even if those teams end up disap-
pointing us in the end.
I used to think only
Lions fans were
long-suffering.

"Whether or not I really enjoy
hockey, it didn't matter," she says now,
a month and a half later. "That's not
what I was going for. I enjoy going to
Michigan sporting events, regardless
of how they're actually doing."
That statement was pretty pow-
erful, especially during this painful
2009-10 season in Michigan sports.
But it proved to me what many more
students who only attend home foot-
ball games need to discover before
they graduate - we only have four
years to experience the most defining
part of a Michigan education.
Even when our teams are lousy,
there's nothing more uniquely maize
and blue than driving to another
school, wearing Michigan colors
proudly and singing "The Victors" as
the other team's fans file out of the
building. And that's why even though
the hockey team is a massive under-
dog heading into Friday's game at Joe
Louis Arena, I'll be there - just in
case. Because that's what University
students do.

A transfixing 'Tank'

The case against
suing Locker'

British drama takes
a gritty look at the
plight of urban youth
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
"Fish Tank" isn't a movie a lot of
people have heard about or would
even typically see, but it offers a
gritty portrayal of life that should
not go unnoticed.

Mia (newcomer Kate Jarvis)
is a 15-year-old girl who dreams
of being a hip-
hop dancer, but **
the obstacles
of her everyday Fish Tank
life - getting
kicked out of At the State
school, picking IFC
fights with other
girls and sneak-
ing alcohol - stand in the way.
Her life has deteriorated and she
spends most of her days wandering


around the streets, the hood of her
sweatshirt pulled over her eyes.
Jarvis delivers a searingly real-
istic performance. It's not exactly
a touching or emotional one, and
it's hard to really like her char-
acter, but that's what makes it
powerful. Jarvis makes Mia come
across as an actual person. Per-
haps what makes her character
so distant is that it's hard to know
what's really going on in her mind
or in her world. Yet this is also the
aspect that makes her so captivat-
ing - part of the film's force
lies in making the audience
wait to see what her next move
will be.
Life seems to get a bit
brighter for Mia when her
Mom's boyfriend Connor
(Michael Fassbender, "Inglou-
rious Basterds") enters the
picture. He floats through
life easily, makes Mia laugh
and encourages her dancing,
softening the harshness of
her life. At the same time, he
develops a relationship with
Mia that soon causes their
lives and the secrets within
them to unravel.
Fassbender is outstanding
in "Fish Tank." He manages
to combine aspects of both
a father figure and a sexual
predator in his character
flawlessly and believably. It's
difficult to imagine a single
person executing such oppo-
site aspects in a way that's
not overdone. His portrayal of

Connor adds just the right amount
of menace to the story.
The strength of the plot and
characters depends a lot on the
setting of the film. The world they
inhabit is one of shabby, squalid
apartment buildings, graffiti and
men in beer-stained t-shirts with
their stomachs out. Their world is
not a traditionally pretty one, but
there are moments when the cam-
era brings out little details like the
way the birds are circling overhead,
the way light comes through the
car window or the way a balloon
makes its way across the skyline.
It's in moments like these that Mia's
world seems to have the potential
for beauty. But just as quickly as
these images flit across the screen,
that potential is swallowed up.
As a girl who aspires to be a hip-
hop backup dancer, Mia spends
a lot of her time with her head-
phones on, listening to her music.
The music doesn't act as merely a
passive supplement to the film -
it adds a valuable layer. In the last
scene, Mia, her mother and her
little sister are dancing together as
a family. After all they have been
through, it's hard not to find the
scene touching, but then the words
of the song come through: "Life's a
bitch and then you die."
"Fish Tank" doesn't try to have
a large, overbearing message; it,
instead focuses on creating an
authentic story in which nothing
is forced. The film shifts beauti-
fully and believably between both
the light and the dark side of life.

Last Sunday was a big night
at the Oscars for "The Hurt
Locker": Six awards, includ-
ing Best Picture, left champions
of the Iraq
War film with
plenty to cheer
about. And I'm
proud of direc-
tor Kathryn-
Bigelow and
screenwriter
Mark Boal, in
an I've-never- ANDREW
met-them-but- LAPIN
they-seem-nice
kind of way.
Unfortunately, my own enthu-
siasm for the movie's victory was
tainted by the events of the pre-
ceding Wednesday, when real-life
bomb disposal technician Sgt.
Jeffrey Sarver sued the filmmak-
ers for essentially stealing his life.
Yeah, I know, Hollywood's hit with
lawsuits every day from misguided
citizens who think they can wran-
gle big bucks out of a half-assed
claim that their ideas were stolen.
You'd think this one wouldn't be
any different.
But it is. See, Sarver actually has
a fairly legitimate leg to stand on,
considering that Boal was embed-
ded with his Iraq unit when doing
research for the original Playboy
Magazine article that inspired the
film. That article, by the way, is a
full-fledged profile on Sarver him-
self, and many key scenes from the
sapposedly fictionalized film were
lifted directly from real life.
Like William James, the charse-
ter played by Jeremy Renner in the
film, Sarver also kept a box of dis-
armed explosives parts under his
bed. And like James, Sarver once
stripped off his bomb suit when
confronted with an unholy amount
of death dynamite. Sounds pretty
damning so far, right?
Except that because he needs
a heart-wrenching, sympathetic
story, Sarver couldn't stop there.
Apparently he also invented the
phrases "the hurt locker" and
"war is a drug." He was somehow
unaware that Boal was nlan-

about everything. The false claims
don't harm the real ones; in fact,
they accentuate the narrative that
Sarver is tryingto present. This is
what happens to anything involving
both Hollywood and the American
legal system, otherwise known as
the two best storytelling organiza-
tions in the country. Each side's job
is to get you to believe its carefully
constructed tale over the other,
whatever it takes.
Not being a law student, I don't
feel qualified to make any state-
ments about the actual validity of
the case. But what I can judge is
the presentation of the arguments.
After all, this is good, old-fashioned
courtroom drama, and it's tailor-
made for the movies, from classics
like "Anatomy of a Murder" to
2008's "Flash of Genius." The side
that wins is the side that can use
the most special effects to distract
from any flaws in the story. Just like
how "Avatar" won the box office.
And the hero of any good story
is the one who convinces you he's
standing up for the little guy. Take
a look at Geoffrey Fieger, the law-
yer representing Sarver. He's a
Michigan grad and a celebrity trial
lawyer, having previously defended
Jack Kevorkian and other high-pro-
file figures. Fieger's firm is based in
Southfield, Mich., and if you grew
up watching Detroit-area TV like
me, then you saw his commercials
all the time.
Making a stage of
the courtroom.
This is a guy who's clearly been
studying Hollywood-style storytell-
ing all his life, because his ads are
shamelessly manipulative. You've
got the shots of him deliveringstir-
ring speeches to his boardroom and
the members of his firm gallantly
ascending the courthouse steps on
their way to fight for your rights.
In 2007, when Fieger was in hot
water for alleged illegal campaign
contributions to John Edwards, he
even exploited Martin Niemller's
famous Holocaust quote ("First
they came for the Communists...")
in a TV spot. Why? Because he
needed to construct a narrative that
would position himself in a positive
light. This is show business, kids. It
ain't pretty.
As consumers of stories, we
always search for the same old
good guy vs. bad guy trappings.
The movies have indoctrinated
usto these kinds of black-and-
white conflicts ever since 1915,
when D.W. Griffith's "Birth of a
Nation" preached the heroism of
the Ku Klux Klan.
The real truth, sadly, is that
there are no good or bad guys
here. Boal and everyone else
responsible for 'The Hurt
Locker" most likely lifted details
directly from Sarver's life to
form a more convincing narra-
tive withoutproperly crediting
their inspiration. Sarver most
likely fabricated large portions
of his claims so that he can more
convincingly play the role of the
cash-strapped downtrodden
veteran who's just standing up
for justice against the Holly-
wood machine. And you better

believe lawyers like Fieger are
going to lie through their teeth
to present the story they want.
Here's what I assume is going
to happen: Atsome point in the
near future when this lawsuit
has been forgotten by the gen-
eral public, the producers of
"The Hurt Locker" will settle
with Sarver out of court. Sarver
will take his money no matter
how small the sum, grateful
that he wrangled anything out
of those sleazy, soulless Holly-
wood types, and then fade into
obscurity with a great story for
his grandkids. And then life in
La La Land will return to nor-
mal, at least until the next high-
profile lawsuit
Because these are the movies,
after all, and successful formu-
las always repeat themselves.

he was in 3-D first. To stop him,

Postseason hopes end
with buzzer-beater loss

31' didn't deserve
that heartbreak

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - The Michigan men's bas-
ketball team has had more than its share of dis-
appointing losses this year, but none of them can
approach what happened in Michigan's 69-68
loss to Ohio State in the quarterfinals of the Big
Ten Tournament on Friday.
The Wolverines clawed their way back from a
13-point deficit to pull it to within five with less
than three minutes remaining.
After stopping the Buckeyes on defense with
the game tied at 64, Michigan guard Manny
Harris made an extremely tough fallaway
jumper to put Michigan up by two. Ohio State
answered with a floater at the other end, and
Michigan called a timeout with nine seconds left
and the score tied.
Harris got the ball, curled around a screen at
the top of the key, and elevated for a midrange
jumper with about three Buckeye defenders
hanging off of him.
It went in. And Michigan, as well as most of
the fans in the stadium, thought that was the
game, that the Wolverines had won, 68-66.
But there were still 2.2 seconds left, and Ohio
State had Evan Turner.
Turner took the inbounds pass, dribbled
about three feet past half-court and made a des-
peration 3-pointer to win the game with Michi-
gan guard Stu Douglass's hand in his face.
"I just wanted to stay in front of him, get a

hand up and try to distract him a little bit," Dou-
glass said. "But he got it off pretty clean, I didn't
want to foul him and it just dropped right in."
officials convened to make sure Turner
released the shot before time ran out, and the
confirmed that it had. Replays showed the clock
didn't start until about half a second after Turn-
er touched the ball.
"I tried to be a part of that, and they wouldn't
let me be a part of that," Michigan coach John
Beilein said. "I was in my coaching box. It's a
whole other issue for another day."
Even so, questions arose after the game about
why Beilein didn't have someone pressuring
the inbounder or someone on Turner before he
crossed half-court.
"I don't think Evan Turner is going to hit a
half-court shot better than anybody else is going
to hit a half-court shot," Beilein said. "If you try
and put two guys on Evan or you try to deny him
by throwing over the top, then he even can get
closer. A half-court shot is a half-court shot."
The shot effectively ended Michigan's season,
with an NIT bid looking highly unlikely.
It was obvious from thebeginningthe Wolver-
ines (7-11 Big Ten, 15-17 overall) knew this might
be their last game of the season - they played
with intensity on both offense and defense.
'We just really wanted to win this game,"
sophomore Zack Novak said. "We honestly felt
we had a pretty good shot to do that. They got
ahead and we kept fighting back and fighting
See BUCKEYES, Page 2B

INDIANAPOLIS -
Two point two. Two and two-tenths.2.2.
It's a number that's going to haunt the
Michigan men's basketball team and the
entire Wolverine fanbase during a painfully
long offseason.
It's a reminder of just
how close Michigan came to
upsettingthe No. 5 team in
the nation, Ohio State, and
continuing its run in the Big
Ten Tournament, and per- '
haps winning it.
It's a reminder of coach-
ing imperfection.0
And it's also a reminder
that, for every ridiculous NICOLE
SportsCenter buzzer-beater AUERBACH
highlight, there's the other-
team, the one on the losing
end. The one poised for abig win. You know, the
team sitting shell-shocked on the bench while
players like Evan Turner are mobbed, cheered
and deified.
Maybe Michigan didn't deserve to win Fri-
day's quarterfinal game, but you can't tell me
they deserved to lose that way. After every pain-
ful loss these players and coaches have been
through this season, they didn't deserve this.
After clawing back from a 13-point deficit, after
building a two-point lead, they didn't deserve

the heartbreak they endured.
"I was hoping that a miracle would happen,
where it'd say 'basket no good,"' Manny Har-
ris said after the game. He wasn't the only one
praying duringthe brief official review at the
end of the game, which ultimately confirmed
that Turner released his 37-footngame-winner
with two-tenths of a second to spare. Basket
good. Michigan crushed.
But even though there seemed to be no good
reason for the Wolverines' season to end, there
was a reason for what happened in the game's
final moments.
Was Michigan coach John Beilein's peculiar
defensive strategy in the final 2.2 seconds the
most disappointingpart? No full-court press?
No defensive pressure at all? Why not double-
team Turner, a national Player of the Year can-
didate?
"They gave me one good look," Turner said
afterward. "I guess being open, it felt a littlebit
free. I had a lot of time to shoot the ball. I felt
like I was in the gym by myself."
Turner is right - Michigan gave him a
better-than-he-should-have-had chance to win
the game.
ButI have a hard time siding with those who
want to bury Beilein for that defensive lapse.
A 37-footer, no matter who shoots it, is not a
guaranteed shot. He said after the game that he

Freshman Natalie Beilsteain
and junior Kylee Butterman led
the comeback for the Wolverines
on the floor routine just as they did
against then-No. 5 Utah on Feb. 19.
Even with the same scores: 9.875
and 9.950, respectively.
The stage was set, but the scene
was nothing new. The No. 12 Mich-
igan women's gymnastics team
took another elite squad down to
the wire at Crisler Arena, and it
once again failed to disappoint.
Last Friday on Senior Night,
the Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten, 13-2
overall) finished with a flash and
ended the evening with stellar floor
routines to overthrow defending
national champion No. 5 Georgia,
196.375-195.800.
Just as the team ousted then-No.

so they did again against the Bull-
dogs - with the duo again posting
scores of 9.875 and 9.950.
"We must have good luck against
fifth-ranked teams, to beat Utah
and Georgiaboth in the same year,"
Michigan coach Bev Plocki said.
The Wolverines beat the then
top-ranked Bulldogs in their last
meeting of the 2008 season, but
the all-time record of 36-4 heavily
favors Georgia.
Senior Sarah Curtis also played a
part in leading the team to victory,
posting consistent scores through-
out the evening and taking home
the all-around crown.
For what could be her final per-
formance in Ann Arbor, Curtis
took advantage of her opportunity.

Mad at Michigan, not March

Jwoke up yesterday morning
with a distinct feeling in the
pit of my stomach - Selec-
tion Sunday, one of my favorite
sports days of the year, was going
to be a sad, depressing state of
affairs this
season, espe-
cially after the
excitement
of the view-
ing party at
Crisler Arena
last year.0
I knew I ANDY
was going to R
hate watching
all the confer-
ence cham-
pionship games, stewing about
the Wolverines' dismal 15-win
season, which ended in just about
the worst way possible. I knew
I was going to hate John Wall,
Evan Turner and other teams'
go-to players in the wake of
Manny Harris's less-than-stellar
season.
And I knew that the actual
show, watching the teams cel-
ebrate tourney berths, was going
to make me nauseated.

But you know what? I enjoyed
myself. Just hecause Michigan
made the tournament once
doesn't mean I forgot what it was
like not to have a direct rooting
interest in the field.
It wasn't hard to get over the
grieving process after Turner's
ridiculous shot, because I've hit
the seven signs throughout the
regular season:
SHOCK-DENIAL
This stage came rather early.
Do you remember that terrible
three-game stretch when Michi-
gan took its first serious NCAA
Tournament blow? Losses to
Marquette, Alabama, and Bos-
ton College - only one of which
made the tournament - and I
was ready to deny.
Of course Michigan is going
to make the tournament, I told
myself. The shooters have to hit
their strides and the Wolverines
will roll through the Big Ten.
PAIN-GUILT
Losing to Northwestern at
home. I don't want to talk about it
any more than that.

ANGER-BARGAINING
A court-rush-inducingwin over
No. 15 Connecticut. Okay. It took
some time but the final push is
here, and it's going to be a hell of a
second-half run.
DEPRESSION-LONELINESS
The Michigan State loss a week
later. As any of the dozens of Spar-
ty fans who saw my very, very sad
cameo on ESPN and texted me to
rub it in can attest, I was definitely
depressed that night.
UPWARD TURN
Consecutive road wins at Min-
nesota and Iowa, and even though
the season's almost over, I'm at
least feeling okay about it.
RECONSTRUCTION
I had no hopes of a Big Ten Tour-
ney title - just try hard, guys.
ACCEPTANCE
Season's over. On to the next one.
So now Ican really enjoy the com-
ing weeks, though I didn't think I
could before.
I'm loving that Pat Forde is pick-
ing Baylor to be in the Final Four

- even though former;Michigan
standout Ekpe Udoh is lighting up
the scoreboard for the Bears.
I actually feel worse for Vir-
ginia Tech than Michigan (how
could you not? The Hokies had a
better record than Wake Forest
and Georgia Tech, and beat them
head-to-head but still got shafted
in favor of both teams).
And I've even moved into that
regional love, where I'm rooting
for teams like Michigan State and
Minnesota. Although I still can't
bring myself to side with the Buck-
eyes.
When all was said and done
and Dickie V's last words were
said, I felt good at the end of the
day. March Madness is in full
swing, I've already gone through
too many matchup scenarios in
my head and picked my favorite
mascots in those few early-round
games that are too close to call.
Michigan or no Michigan, it's
still March.

Michigan defeats four eastern squads, wins
Wolverine Invitational by a combined 81-20

By JAMES BLUM The V

This weekend was a story of
numbers at the Wolverine Invita-
tional. The water polo team took
to the pools of the Canham Nata-
torium against five smaller schools
that the Michigan student body
out-populates 41,674-16,369.
This immense disparity was
never more evident than against
Grove City, which happens to share
the Wolverine as its mascot. No. 8
Michigan carries a full 31-person
squad. Its Pennsylvanian counter-
part is a small Division III school
without the ability to award ath-
letic scholarships. With a simple
glance down the benches it was
clearly a mismatch; Michigan had
five strings to Grove City's 13 play-
ers. Michigan went on to win that
match 18-S.
The Friday-Saturday invitation-
al saw Michigan (9-0 CWPA, 20-6
overall) sweep the competition,
destroying all of its opponents.

"It was very fitting that Sarah
would come out on top tonight,"
Plocki said. "I think everybody
wanted to win it so badly for the
seniors ... everybody wanted it
to be this kind of night for our
seniors, and everybody stepped it
up a notch."
And in usual fashion, Curtis
took home top honors with the
all-around, but didn't even have
to win any other events to win
the spot.
"That's kind of been my his-
tory," Curtis said.
"I'm not exactly the person
that is great on anything. I'm not
going to guarantee that I win
anything, but I'm pretty consis-
tent on everything. That makes
me a great person for this team,
because I contribute in all events,

essarily wants to win every-

had four good counting scores,"
Golder said. "Even though we
made some mistakes, I think we
only had to count a mistake one
time. That's the big difference.
Before, we were making three or
four mistakes on the same event."
With only one dual meet left,
the team sees this weekend's per-
formance as a keybuildingblock.
"I think (the momentum) will
help us," Golder said. "We want-
ed to prove ourselves that we can
go on the road and have a good
meet, and we did have a pretty
darn good meet. It's just another
thing that they have that they can
draw on and it should give them
confidence."
Next Saturday, Michigan will

Anderson said. "Today was a home

back, it's just disappointing."
Senior DeShawn Sims was
playing in probably his last
game as a Wolverine, and he
made it count.
He put the team on his back
in the first half, scoring 12
points on 5-of-7 shooting and
singlehandedly kept the Wol-
verines in the game.
The second half was the
Manny Harris Show. Harris
scored 22 of his 26 points in the
second frame, going to the line
and knifing his way through the
interior of the Ohio State (14-4,
25-7) defense.
The amazing shots he hit at
the end of the game were sup-
posed to be the cherries on
top of a pantheon-level perfor-
mance, but ended up instead
being footnotes.
"Coach drew up good plays,
I was able to make some shots,"
Harris said. "I don't think none
of that matters now that Evan
made that incredible shot. It
was good to make shots, but at
the same time, I wish we would
have won that game."

Beilein: Turner as likely
as anyone to make
miracle half-court shot
By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - It may have
been the Michigan men's basketball
team's best game this season.
And it may have been the most
important shot of Manny Harris's
career, when he gave Michigan the
lead with 2.2 seconds left.
But when all is said and done,
the only things that will be remem-
bered from Friday's heartbreaking
loss to Ohio State are Evan Turner's
37-foot shot to win the game at the
buzzer and Michigan coach John
Beilein's decision not to press on
the inbounds pass.
Despite the decision, Beilein
vehemently defended the move not
to double-team or front Turner the
Big Ten Player of the Year in the
backcourt.
"I don't think Evan Turner is
going to hitsahalf-court shot better
than anyhody else is going to hit a
half-court shot. We wanted to limit
that type of opportunity" Beilein
said. "If it was in quarter-court,
there's a whole different defense
you're going to play. But when
you've got to make a half-court
shot, it's alot different"
On the play, Ohio State's David
Lighty inbounded the ball to Turn-
er, who took two dribbles down the
right side of the court before spot-
ting up midwaybetween half-court
and the three-point line and hitting
the now-infamous shot that ended
Michigan's season.
The shot was reviewed to see if
Turner had released it in time, but
after a meeting at the scorer's table,
the referees ruled that the ball was
out of his hands with.2 seconds left
on the clock.
Immediately after the game,
ESPN commentators criticized
Beilein's move to play passive zone
defense against Ohio State's top
scorer and a leading candidate for
the National Player of the Year.
But Michigan's players defended
AUERBACH
From Page 1B
didn't think Turner's chances of
hitting a half-court shot were any
better than his teammates' chances.
"We wanted to limit that type
of opportunity," Beilein said. "So
we matched it up in a zone that
whatever area people went to was
going to be a one dribble. Either
one or two guys were going to be
in front of him. ... If you try to
put two guys on Evan or you try
to deny him by throwing over the
top, then he even can get closer.
So it's six of one, half dozen of the
other; a half-court shot is a half-
court shot."
In the postgame locker room,
Harris referred to Turner's bas-
ket as "incredible" over and over
again. He said nobody expected
the 37-footer to fall - I certainly
didn't - but as Turner released
the shot, I knew, like so many in
Conseco Fieldhouse, that after a
half-second that felt like an eter-
nity, it was going to go in.
Beilein's not perfect, just like
any other college basketball
coach. Should he have pressed?

Should he have, at the very least,
pressured the inbounds play? Yes,
of course.
But Beilein had a reason for
his defensive setup, even if others

don't agree.
And even takingthe game's
final 2.2 seconds into consider-
ation, Friday showed exactly why
the Wolverines' season should still
be going.
Michigan's two stars, Harris
and senior forward DeShawn
Sims, combined for 42 points,
and the team finally found a third
scoring threat, Stu Douglass, who
put up 16 points of his own. Har-
ris was electric down the stretch,
singlehandedly pulling the Wol-
verines back into the game.
Friday's loss was, at the same
time, the epitome of the Wolver-
ines' potential this year and all the
misfortune they've suffered.
"That's a great ... microcosm of
the season," Beilein said. "That's a
little bit of the frustration that we
have this year. Some things that
you can't always control happen
to you. It's certainly indicative of
some things that happened."
And it shouldn't have been over.
If Turner's shot clanged off the rim,
Michigan would have next faced
Illinois, and then Minnesota after
that. Sure, winning four games in
four days would have been atall
task for a Wolverine squad that's
been inconsistent all season.
Butboy, would it have been great
to see them try.

their coach in giving up the poten-
tial half-court shot instead of risk-
ing a defensive breakdown near the
basket with fewer men defending in
the frontcourt similar to Christian
Laettner's miracle buzzer-beating
shot for Duke in the 1992 NCAA
Tournament.
"Coach drew up a defensive
scheme," Harris said. "I guess
everyone just thought, there's no
way he's goingto makea half-court
shot, and he did. I know coach
probably was thinking, it would just
be incredible, crazy for someone to
make a half-court shot the way the
game had been going right then.
But he did. A lot of credit to him....
Great players make great shots, and
he did that."
One of the reasons the Wolverines
didn't want to double-team Turner
was the potential that he could blow
by the defender and get a wide-open
shot or find an open teammate with
the defense spread thin.
"We just wanted to stay with
them, stay in front of him, make
sure he had to take a contested shot
and make sure they didn't get any
threes off," Michigan sophomore
Zack Novak said. "He hit a heck of
a shot."
Even Ohio State's players were
surprised that Michigan didn't
throw a double-team at Turner.
"I was sprinting behind him as
fast as I could, because I thought
they were going to double-team
him, so I thought I was going to be
open," Lighty said. "But when it left
his hands, it just felt like it was float-
ing up there forever pretty much,
and when it went in, I felt like I was
at a loss for words pretty much."
It appeared that teams quickly
learned not to follow Michigan's
lead. Later that night at the Big Ten
Tournament, Michigan State pres-
sured Minnesota on it's last second
chance to win in regulation with
five seconds left, and the shot from
near half-court fell wide left.
Right or wrong, Beilein will be
criticized for the coaching decision
that ended Michigan's season.
"Some things that you can't
always control happen to you,"
Beilein said. "It's certainly indica-
tive of some things that happened."

In a rare occurrence this season,
the Wolverines got the timely goals

Even with a three-goal lead Fri-

The Wolverines did not want a

to have the Spartans come back

'M' top guns struggle in Austin

Texas sweeps doubles
matches in 6-1 victory
over Wolverines
By EMILY BONCHI
For the Daily
The No. 25 Michigan men's ten-
nis team went to Austin this week-
end knowing it would have to play
f its best game in order to beat No.
5 Texas. After all, the Longhorns
led the Wolverines 12-3 all-time in
duel matches.
But the Wolverines were unable
to capitalize on important plays,
falling to the Longhorns, 6-1.
"We had some matches where
we were close on first sets, so we
definitely had some opportuni-
ties to be hitting a little bit better,"
Michigan coach Bruce Berque said.
"Texas is a very good team, so we
had to play the bigger points a little
bit better than we did."
In singles play, first set matches
at No. 3, 4 and 5 all went into a tie-
breaking seventh game, resulting in
only one victory for the Wolverines.
Texas (15-2) swept all three
doubles matches to take the early
1-0 lead, forcing Michigan (4-6) to
lose just its second doubles point
all season. It was also the second
loss for No. 2 doubles pair seniors

ski all season.'
Singles play did not get much
better for the Wolverines, as Sroc-
zynski notched the team's only
win, defeating No. 95 Kellen Dami-
co in a tense match at No. 3, 7-6,x
7-fl.
At No. 1 singles, it seemed to be
a case of d6ja vu for 46th-ranked
junior and Jason Jung, who lost
to No. 7 Dimitar Kutrovsky for the;
second time this season. The two'
met at the ITA National Indoors
Tournament last November, where
Kutrovsky defeated Jung 6-2, 6-4,
the same score as their match on
Saturday.
Five of Texas's six singles play-
ers are ranked in the top 100 and
the Longhorns are Michigan's
highest-ranked opponent of the
season thus far.
One of the improvements coach
Berque is looking to focus on before
the start of Big Ten play next week-
end is the team's competitive edge.
"I think the competitive aspect
of having the discipline to play
aggressively and play the right way
under pressure when it matters the Senior Mike Sroczynski, pictured here, alor

allowed Michigan State to gain
any momentum for the rest of the
weekend. It forechecked the hell
out of the Spartans, puttingthem
on their heels and forcingturnover
after turnover.
Aside from the final five minutes
of play in Saturday's first period,
during which the Spartans tallied
three power play goals, the Wol-
verines played as close to mistake-
free hockey as possible, something
Michigan coach Red Berenson said
would put the Wolverines in pretty
good shape.
Michigan received contribu-
tions from its top performers
in juniors Carl Hagelin, Louie
Caporusso, and Matt Rust - the
trio totaled seven points in the
weekend series. The Wolverines
also got secondary scoring from
sophomore David Wohlberg and
freshman Chris Brown, who com-
bined to net three goals.
And although you may think the
5-3 win on Saturday was a close
game, it really wasn't - it was

defense at the turn of the calendar
year, well before Hogan got hurt.
In his mind, if the Wolverines
can play good defense and keep
the puck out of the net, they'll
win. It just so happened that
Michigan was able to score 10
goals this weekend and have both
the offense and defense rolling.
On Friday, the Wolverines
jumped out to an early 3-0 lead.
The Michigan defense was sure
to clear loose pucks away from
Hunwick and limit the Spartans
chances to get back in the game.
Michigan State (14-8-6-2,19-13-6)
just couldn't get anything going in
the Wolverines' zone.
The defense was challenged a
bit more Saturday. Though Michi-
gan scored two quick goals in
the middle of the first period, the
Spartans scored three power play
goals to lead after 20 minutes of
play.
That's when the Wolverines'
defense turned in one of its best
periods of the season. Michigan
carried the play on offense, but
clamped down on defense and
outshot Michigan State 16-1 in the
second period. But the Wolver-
ines managed just one goal to tie
the game at 3-3.
And after Michigan took the
lead early in the third period, the
defense stepped up once again.
Eleven minutes into the third,
sophomore forward Luke Glen-
dening took a holding penalty -to
that point the Spartans were a per-
fect three-for-three on the power
play. This time, Michigan with-
stood Michigan State's attack and
Hunwick stopped all five of the
Spartans' shots. All of Michigan
State's four goals on the weekend
had come on the power play.
"It was a good team effort, and
that's really what it's all about
this time of year," Berenson said.
Hunwick finished the week-

end of the second period on Satur-
day night, Michigan had outshot
Michigan State 16-1 in the frame,
possessing the puck in the Spartan
end for most of the period.
I could go and on about why this
was the Wolverines' most complete
effort of the season, but I think you
get the picture. Michigan laid the
hammer to Michigan State, and
if the Wolverines can play next
weekend at Joe Louis Arena like
they played at Munn Ice Arena this
weekend, there's no telling the lim-
its of this team.
At the end of the game, the Com-
cast camera crew zoomed in on
Spartan junior captain Jeff Petry.
The disgusted look on his face as he
went down the line to shake hands
with the Wolverines summed up
the series for Michigan State.
Was he disappointed with how
the Spartans played? I'm guessing,
yeah. Was he worried his season
could be over so soon? Maybe.
Should he be surprised his team
was dominated up and down the
ice all weekend by the Wolverines?
Not one bit.

end with 15 saves on Friday and
18 saves on Saturday. It seems the
team's confidence in the walk-on
goaltender is growing more with
each passing game.
"I think our team is coming
together," Berenson said. "And
when you come together it's not
just the offense, it's not just the
scorers. It's not just the power
play. It's not just the goalie, it's
everybody. And whether it's a
commitment to backcheck, or a
commitment to play in your own
zone without the puck, then we're
doing a better job of it now than
we were before Christmas. Our
team has bought into what we
have to do to win."
Michigan is now heading back
to Joe Louis Arena this Friday,
where the Wolverines will take on
the No. 1 seed, Miami (OH)
"We're on a roll right now,"
Brown said. "This is the best
hockey we've played all year. And
going into the Joe, this is what
we have to do. We have to be on
a roll."
When Michigan went into the
locker room after Saturday's win,
the maize and blue mountain lay
against the white board looking
on as the seniors led the team in
"The Victors."
"We don't get to sing this song
very often in this locker room,
and you guys earned it," Berenson
told his team.
The Wolverines were 10 wins
away from the peak of the moun-
tain when the CCHA tournament
started. Now, it has been four
games, and four wins. Michigan
has reached a ledge, and the Wol-
verines are on their way up.
"Four games ago when we
started the playoffs, we knew
we needed 10 (wins) to win the
National Championship," Hun-
wick said. "We're obviously wor-
ried about the first six to get there
in the NCAA Tournament. But
game by game, period by period,
that's all you can hope for. And
hopefully at the end of the moun-
tain, we're on top."

Michigan State next weekend.
"We definitely prefer to play at
home, and that will help a little
bit," Berque said. "But the bottom
line is that we have to play well
enough."

Wolverines sweep Hofstra, Louisville

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
LOUISVILLE, Ken. - After
sweeping all four games in Ala-
bamalast weekend, the No.5 Mich-
igan softball team looked to keep
its offense rolling in Louisville this
past weekend. Michigan (16-4)
showed it was up for the challenge,
as the Wolverines beat No. 18 Lou-
isville 9-5 and Hofstra 4-3 in extra
innings on Saturday.
Michigan extended its winning
streak to 10 games on Sunday with
a 3-1 win against Hofstra and a
7-3 win against Louisville in eight
innings.
The pitchers have been the Wol-
verines' most consistent unit this
season - both on the mound and in
the batter's box. And at the Red and
Black Tournament, it was senior
pitcher Nikki Nemitz that gave the
offense a lift. Nemitz combined to
go 4-for-5 in both games on Satur-
day at the plate.
Against Hofstra, Nemitz drilled
a two-run home run in the top of
the second inning, giving the Wol-

verines a 2-1 lead.
"I love being a hitting pitcher,"
Nemitz said. "I get to help myself
and contribute to the team on both
ends of the game. It felt good. It
feels good to finally be back where
I'm at and help my team out."
In both of Saturday's games, the
Wolverines trailed early and had to
mount comebacks to get the wins.
Against Louisville, Michigan
quickly found itself down 5-0 after
the second inning, but the Wol-
verines rallied back in the top of
the third on a Cardinals error and
a three-RBI double from Nemitz.
Junior pitcher Jordan Taylor
settled down in the bottom of the
third and kept the Cardinals score-
less for the rest of the game.
"We have a lot of people return-
ing from last year," Nemitz said.
"Last year, we went on losing
streaks or had a lot of tough games
where we were down and had to
fight back. This team knows how
to win. The game's not over until
the seventh inning and third out.
We're used to fighting back. I think
it's just something we're good at."

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
stressed the importance of
Nemitz's role as the seventh hitter
in the lineup, as Nemitz continues
to bat behind junior slugger Dorian
Shaw.
"We're starting to see teams
pitch around (Shaw)," Hutchins
said. "She's doing a good job of
managing the zone and taking
walks. We'll take her on base. Any-
thing they give us, we'll take. So,
we're pleased with that in the mid-
dle of the lineup, especially when
we've got someone like (Nemitz)
hot behind her. That's a good com-
bination to have."
Saturday's second game against
Hofstra went into extra innings,
and this time, it was senior catcher
Roya St. Clair's plate discipline that
helped the team score first in extra
innings.
St. Clair came up to bat with
runners on first and third base
with one out. After fouling off mul-
tiple pitches, St. Clair reached on
a fielding error, scoring both run-
ners to give Michigan a 4-2 edge.
Although Hofstra came back to

score one run in the bottom of that
frame, the Wolverines held on to
get their second win on Saturday.
"During an at-bat, no matter
what happened in the previous
pitches, it's only about one pitch
to make something good happen,"
Hutchins said. "(St. Clair) has done
a really good job of trying to do
what she's capable of doing. We
needed her to put the ball 'in play
and put it down. Fortunately, it
worked out that we got two runs. I
give Roya a lot of credit for battling
through that at bat. She was down
and behind, but she found a way to
make it go our way."
After a two-hour rain delay on
Sunday, the Michigan offense was
quiet in its second game of the
weekend against Hofstra. The Wol-
verines put up a three-spot in the
bottom of the second inning, but
had difficulty converting hits into
runs for much of the game.
But even though Hofstra slowed
the Wolverines' offense, Taylor's
solid seven innings and Michigan's
three runs were enough to get the
win.

A disappointing series split at the
Caravelle Resort Classic in South
Carolina may bring consistency
issues up to the plate once again for
the Michigan baseball team.
The Wolverines (6-9 overall) had a
promising start to the weekend, with
wins over Ball State and Lipscomb,
but then suffered back-to-back losses
to No.10 Coastal Carolina.
"Any time we split a series we are
obviously falling short of our goal,"
Michigan coach Rich Maloney said.
The Wolverines began strong
Friday when the team jumped out
to an early 8-0 lead over Ball State.
Redshirt junior second baseman
Anthony Toth led Michigan with
four hits, while senior first baseman
Mike Dufek and sophomore catcher
Coley Crank each tallied three.

The Cardinals fought back in the
fifth inning and scored six runs on
six hits. The game was tied up in the
top of the sixth, but the Wolverines
answered with four straight singles
to win the game, 12-8.
The Wolverines carried their
momentum over to Saturday morn-
ing as they quickly built a 15-0 lead
in the first three innings against
Lipscomb. This was the first time
Michigan scored 10 or more runs in
the first inning since 1996. It would
be enough for a 17-4 win.
During Saturday's games, fresh-
man shortstop Derek Dennis hit the
first two home runs of his career
as a Wolverine and now has four
multi-hitgames this season.
"It was great to see Dennis play-
ing well and hitting home runs,"
Maloney said. "He has a chance to
be a star for us."
But the bats did not continue to

swing in Michigan's favor for the
remainder of the series. Coastal
Carolina defeated the Wolverines
13-4 on Saturday afternoon as the
Wolverines had to use five different
pitchers to get through the long day.
"Five. consecutive weekends of
travel down south can become tir-
ing and stressful," Dufek said. "It is
more comfortable to play at home
and your sleeping hours aren't as
extreme as ... on the road."
On Sunday, senior pitcher Alan
Oaks gave up only two earned runs
and matched his season high with
seven strikeouts. But the Wolverines
were unable to bring in any runs and
fell 3-0 to the Chanticleers.
Going cold on the mound and
at the plate in the same game has
been a prominent issue since the
preseason for Michigan. The incon-
sistency on offense and defense
plagued the team last year and is

a problem the Wolverines hoped
to address during the early-season
stretch.
Michigan has only demonstrat-
ed a healthy combination of pitch-
ing and hitting arguably once this
year against Jacksonville State. In
the 14-2 win, senior pitcher Alan
Oaks gave up only two runs on four
hits and two walks with two strike-
outs over six innings. Meanwhile,
Dufek, Toth and sophomore third
baseman John Lorenz all tallied
three hits.
And since then, the Wolverines
have not seen such consistency in
any of their games.
"If we can get a combination
of the two together, working at
the same time, we can be a good
team," Maloney said. "I believe
it's in there, I believe it's attain-
able. Unfortunately, it hasn't come
together yet."

Michigan State in every facet of

of the Spar- ,

Com- ~f

seed Michi-
gan State, the
Wolverines
were hands-down the underdog.
They had finished seventh
in the final conference stand-
ings, and after their first-round
sweep of Lake Superior State last
weekend, the Michigan had a
date with its intrastate rival for

a tough best-of-three series, not
only against the conference's best
team, but also at Munn Ice Arena.
And I'll be honest, I didn't
expect a series win for the Maize
and Blue - and most people
would probably agree with me on
this one. Despite Shawn Hunwick
leading the Wolverines to three
wins in four games, they still
didn't have their true number-one
starter in Bryan Hogan, and were
also without their top defense-
man and senior captain, Chris
Summers. Not to mention they
had beaten the Spartans only
once in four tries this season.
If Michigan was going to clinch
a trip to Detroit, it would be by a
slim margin, maybe an overtime
win in the third and deciding
game in East Lansing - or soI
thought,
For much of the season, the
Wolverines have disappointed,
but in their 5-1 and 5-3 wins

against Michigan State, they
proved why they're one of the
best teams in the country when
they can string together a com-
plete game - or for this week-
end's sake, two. And that's why
they can make a trip to the NCAA
Tournament for the 20th straight
year.
For 115 of 120 minutes of game
time this weekend, Michigan
smacked around Michigan State
and dictated the tempo of play
from the get-go. From the open-
ing minutes on Friday night, you
had a sense that the Wolverines
didn't think of themselves as an
underdog on the road, ina semi-
hostile environment and with a
lose-and-go home scenario pend-
ing.

bing three goals in the opening
