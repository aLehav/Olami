ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Hans 
von 
Spakovsky, 

The Heritage Foundation’s 
manager on the election law 
reform initiative, and Bryan 
Caplan, economics professor 
at George Mason University, 
debated if President Donald 
Trump’s 
immigration 

platform harms the United 
States in an event hosted by 
The 
Michigan 
Review 
on 

Friday night.

In his opening statement, 

Caplan attacked many of the 
actions 
Trump 
has 
taken 

against immigration. Caplan 
explained 
the 
economic 

benefits 
of 
immigration 

and that immigrants do not 
commit crimes at the rate 
that Trump has said they do. 
Caplin said since immigration 
increases total production, 
the gains nationally tend to 
outweigh the losses. 

Spakovsky, 
however, 

advocated for the actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Trump 

administration, 
including 

laws that need to be enforced 
— especially for those that 
enforce legal immigration.

“You 
often 
hear 
the 

terms that we have a broken 
system,” Spakovsky said. “We 
don’t have a broken system. 
We have a very complex set of 
laws governing immigration 
and who we allow in and 
who we don’t allow in. The 

problem has been for decades 
is that the political will to 
enforce the law was not there 
in Washington.”

Undeclared 
student 

Dylan 
Calewarts 
was 

disappointed 
the 
event 

didn’t explicitly address if 
Trump’s 
immigration 
plan 

is hurting the United States, 
but appreciated the topics 
discussed.

“I thought it was great 

that the issues were being 
talked about from a policy 

angle, not from a personality 
… angle. I would say that the 
point was struck home that 
the Constitution gives 100 
percent 
immigration 
and 

naturalization authority to 
Congress and the only power 
the president has is what 
Congress has given him,” 
Calewarts said.

The term “illegal aliens,” 

Spakovsky 
added, 
is 
the 

legal term used for illegal 
immigrants, so they should 
be called such. The deviation 

from the legal term, he said, 
is a way for those who want to 
enforce immigration law to be 
discredited.

“The 
reason 
this 
has 

happened, that it’s supposedly 
politically incorrect to use 
the correct legal term, is 
because many people want 
to blur the line between 
illegal immigration and legal 
immigration 
… 
the 
whole 

point of trying to blur that 

Through 
discovery, 

treatment and implementation 
— along with the use of analytics 
and big data — University of 
Michigan researchers will soon 
advance specialized medicine 
and personalized health care.

The 
recently 
revealed 

Precision Health initiative — 
which 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 

at his Leadership Breakfast 
earlier this month — will 
combine several research areas 
across the University outside of 
medical disciplines to create a 
broad approach to optimizing 
the use of research data.

Aside 
from 
incorporating 

these 
different 
disciplines, 

however, Precision Health is 
partnered with the University’s 
Office of the Provost, School 
of Public Health, College of 
Engineering 
and 
Michigan 

Medicine.

Creguer, 
Precision 

Health senior project manager, 
said the goal is ultimately 
to improve patient care in a 
way that addresses several

Each week, The Michigan Daily 

will be publishing a wrap-up of the 
most important bills proposed in 
Michigan Legislature over the past 
seven days:

SB 620: This bill would amend 

a 1976 law on sexual education to 
require the teaching of consent 
in sexual education programs in 
school, to address sexual assault, 
bystander intervention and dating 
violence.

State Sen. Curtis Hertel, D-East 

Lansing, proposed the amendment 
to the bill, calling it “Yes Means 
Yes” legislation in the press release 
on his website.

“College-aged women are four 

times more likely than any other 
age group to face sexual assault. 
When we send our kids off to 
college, we should worry about 
their grades and how they are 
going to pay for their books, not if 
they will be sexually assaulted,” 
Hertel said in the press release.

The bill aims to clarify the 

definition of consent, including 
what it looks like in a committed 
relationship.

SB 629: This bill seeks to modify

The 
national 
spotlight 

placed on the debate over 
kneeling during the national 
anthem was brought Monday 
night to the Ann Arbor City 
Council, 
as 
four 
council 

members knelt during the 
Pledge of Allegiance.

Council 
members 
Jason 

Frenzel, Sumi Kailasapathy, 
Chip 
Smith 
and 
Chuck 

Warpehoski 
all 
knelt 
in 

silent 
protest 
during 
the 

Pledge of Allegiance, which 
is traditionally said prior to 
every City Council meeting.

Warpehoski 
announced 

his intention to kneel during 
the 
pledge 
prior 
to 
the 

council meeting in a post on 
his website. In that post, he 

compared kneeling during the 
pledge to kneeling during a 
football game for an injured 
player. 

“I can’t speak to what is in 

each person’s heart, but for 
me to ‘take a knee’ is an act of 
attention, of concern, and of 
respect. And it is in that spirit 
that I take a knee at tonight’s 
City 
Council 
meeting,” 

Warpehoski wrote.

In 
the 
portion 
of 
the 

council meeting designated 
for 
announcements 
from 

the 
council 
members, 

Kailasapathy explained why 
she joined Warpehoski in 
kneeling. 

“For me democracy is more 

than just symbolic, it’s actually 
holding 
up 
 
democratic 

practices,” Kailasapathy said. 
“I would want others to judge

City residents, students gather for 
peace and justice solidarity march

Over 100 brave the rain to participate in nationwide movement at Hanover Square Park

Meeting at Hanover Square 

Park and marching to Liberty 
Plaza in the rain, over 100 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students, Ann Arbor residents 
and others took part in the 

Nationwide Solidarity March 
for Peace and Justice Saturday 
afternoon.

The Ann Arbor march was 

in coordination with similar 
marches across the country, 
all of which were aimed at 
promoting peace and standing 
up to all forms of hatred and 
violence.

According 
to 
Ann 
Arbor 

resident Corky Wa, an organizer 
of the march, the purpose of the 
march was to boost the spirits 
of those who may be exhausted 
from constant activism since 
the start of President Donald 
Trump’s term. 

“After months and months of 

calls and letters and emails and 

postcards, people are starting 
to lose their mojo and the hate 
seems to be stronger,” Wa said.

Though the attendance of the 

march was dampened by rain, 
Wa led her fellow activists in a 
protest featuring chants against 
racism, the proliferation of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and

Outdoor enthusiasts in the 

Ann Arbor area now have two 
new miles of paved trail to 
blaze as of Saturday.

The trail will connect hikers 

and bikers to the Matthaei 
Botanical Gardens northeast of 
Ann Arbor, Nicols Arboretum 
and Gallup Park’s Border-to-
Border bike trails along the 
Huron River, offering a pathway 
to the Matthaei gardens that 
doesn’t require a car.

Karen Sikkenga, associate 

director 
of 
the 
botanical 

gardens, said in a University 
press release she hopes the trail 
will ease motor vehicle traffic 
to the gardens, noting the 
number of visitors to Matthaei 
gardens has been increasing 

year to year.

“Currently 
more 
than 

135,000 
visitors 
each 
year 

carpool, ride a bike or drive a 
car to get to Matthaei. The new 

trail will allow them to leave 
their cars safely behind,” she 
said.

The new trail additionally 

expands the extensive network 
of motorless routes on the 
northeastern edge of Ann Arbor 
city and township, connecting 
the 
University 
Hospital, 

Central and North Campuses, 
among other destinations, such 
as Eastern Michigan University 
in Ypsilanti.

The project was constructed 

through 
a 
multi-year 

collaboration 
between 
the 

University — which houses 
the trail — and Ann Arbor 
Charter Township. $2.5 million 
was raised for the project 
through a combination of local, 
county and township grants, 
and an additional $800,000 
raised from close to 150 local 
individuals 
and 
neighboring 

companies, including Toyota

a University affiliate what 
the University’s Bicentennial 
means to them. 

“I hope what (the Bicentennial) 
could be is to mark a new 
chapter for many students of 
color on campus. As an Arab 
student, our identity can finally 
be recognized on campus. It’s 
been here for 200 years now — 
I think it’s about time that we 
are recognized on campus and 
with that so many doors can 
be open for us as students on 
campus.”

and NSF.

Mike Moran, Ann Arbor 

Charter Township supervisor, 
said in the press release he was 
pleased with the collaboration 
between local stakeholders to 
open the trail.

“It’s an excellent example of 

what can be accomplished when 
the township, the university, 
county 
government, 
state 

government, 
local 
corporate 

entities 
and 
citizens 
work 

together to achieve a common 
goal,” Moran said.

LSA junior Miranda Miley 

was excited about the new 
addition 
to 
the 
already-

extensive network of outdoor 
trails north of Central Campus. 

“I think in the Arb the trails 

are especially nice and I’m 
really excited that there is 
now a trail out to the botanical 
gardens,” Miley said. “It would 
be nice to have other trails that 
extend out of the immediate 
campus area to other places 
or parks in the surrounding 
areas.” 

Lara 
Moehlman 
also 

contributed to this report.

misconceptions 
about 

precision 
medicine, 
an 

approach 
for 
protecting 

health and treating disease 
that considers other factors 
aside from an individual’s 
own health, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

“The idea is really to bring 

together multiple disciplines 
and expertise from across 
campus to address the issue 
of precision health,” Creguer 
said. “We specifically chose 
the name Precision Health 
because we are trying to 
incorporate 
many 
other 

factors than just medicine.”

Some 
of 
these 
factors 

include 
lifestyle, 

environmental, 
family 

history, social environment, 
genetics, 
which 
will 
all 

contribute to large amounts 
of 
data 
about 
individual 

health. The available and 
collected data will then allow 
disciplines like social work to 
take advantage of this work 
and come up with strategies 
for better patient care.

While the initiative is still 

in its initial stages, one project 
is already underway. With 
the opioid project, Creguer 
said, researchers hope to take 
an approach geared toward 
addiction prevention first — 
especially by more personally 
and 
precisely 
applying 

prescriptions to patient needs 
— before having to address 
addiction treatment.

“The project will examine 

ways we can predict how 
much 
pain 
medication 

someone will need, based 
on their individual genetic 
profile, 
physiological 

condition 
and 
social, 

environmental and lifestyle 
factors,” Schlissel said at the 
Leadership Breakfast. “This 
will allow physicians to tailor 
how they help individual 

patients manage their pain. … 
There is no better university 
in our nation to tackle a 
problem like this.”

Precision 
Health 

Co-Director Sachin Kheterpal 
agreed, 
and 
said 
this 

particular project within the 
initiative allows researchers 
to utilize the resources that 
are available through the 
University’s 19 schools and 
colleges for maximum care.

“We wanted to make sure 

that we created an initiative 
that not only leverages those 
strengths 
but 
demanded 

them, and that’s one of the 
reasons why — in addition to 
the overall infrastructure and 
the overall science that we’re 
going to be funding using 
this effort — that we did pick 
one specific public health 
concern: the opioid misuse 
challenge that is currently 
going on,” Kheterpal said. 
“It’s one that demands the 
most out of Michigan.”

The Michigan Genomics 

Initiative 
— 
which 
just 

reached a milestone 50,000 
participants, 
and 
is 
a 

big part of the research 
already 
being 
conducted 

for Precision Health — will 
continue to be expanded to 
diversify the population of 
the project’s sampling. Aside 
from 
the 
opioid 
project, 

mental health, cancer and 
metabolic disease remain of 
interest to researchers within 
the 
initiative 
for 
future 

consideration.

And while students are 

not yet involved, there are 
several 
plans 
to 
engage 

with 
student 
researchers 

on campus, Kheterpal said. 
For example, the initiative 
will 
be 
offering 
funding 

for 
additional 
research 

programs, 
developing 

curriculum 
through 
a 

certificate 
program 
and 

potentially 
some 
degree 

programs, and continuing 
education for practitioners.

Lastly, developing data and 

analytics tools that will allow 
researchers to easily access, 
use the information that is 
collected 
and 
eventually 

integrate 
this 
information 

into the field; all of which are 
priorities as well, Creguer 
said.

“There has been a great 

advancement 
of 
precision 

medicine, 
particularly 
in 

the area of cancer, so what 
we’re attempting to do is so 
much broader,” Creguer said. 
“There are lots of avenues 
we can go down, but we 
anticipate choices somewhere 
we can have large impact 
drawing on the resources we 
have here at the University.”

This initiative will not 

come 
without 
challenges, 

however; 
a 
need 
for 

infrastructure, 
computing 

power and capabilities, along 
with the desire to implement 
these findings into the field 
in a practical and applicable 
way will always have to be 
considered, Creguer said.

In addition, Kheterpal said 

there is a necessity to create 
appropriate levels of focus to 
ensure research doesn’t fail 
for the sake of working on 
too many projects at once, 
along with adjusting cultural 
expectations of medicine.

“There are cultural issues 

to be managed here related 
to the culture of health care, 
medicine and how we define 
the interaction between a 
health care system and the 
community that it serves,” 
Kheterpal said. “A lot of what 
Precision Health is about is 
improving the transparency 
of 
the 
information 
that 

we 
offer, 
improving 
the 

transparency of the data that 
we have when we make a 
recommendation to a patient. 
… That’s going to require 
some culture changes both on 
the part of providers who are 
giving that information and 
on the part of the patient or 
the health participant who’s 
receiving that information.”

Following the protests, the 

council members returned to 
their scheduled business. 

The most pressing issue was 

the vote on the approval of 
more funds for the third year of 
Ann Arbor’s controversial deer-
culling efforts. The resolution 
on the table would approve 
an 
additional 
$110,000 
to 

completely fund the estimated 
2018 budget of $370,000 to be 
spent on the deer cull.

The program, which began 

in 2015, was designed to help 
deal with the overpopulation 
of deer in the Ann Arbor area. 
Eight 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

spoke in the public commentary 
about the deer cull. University 
of 
Michigan 
professor 

Christopher 
Dick 
spoke 
in 

support of the cull, saying it 
was necessary for the health 
of the deer and the forests they 
lived in.

“Culling the herd can actually 

help the dear by reducing 
the spread of deer diseases 
that may be exacerbated by 
overabundance,” Dick said. 

Other 
speakers, 
such 
as 

Ann Arbor resident Robert 
McGee, attempted to rebut 
the point that deer posed any 
extraordinary threat to the 
wildlife and forests of Ann 
Arbor, or to its citizens. 

Ann Arbor resident Sally 

Daniels went a step further and 
criticized the council for its 
past and current support of the 
deer cull.

“Council 
members 
have 

based their vote on their own 
limited 
experiences 
rather 

than 
the 
wishes 
of 
their 

constituents,” 
Daniels 
said. 

“A deer ran on top of council 
member 
Kailasapathy’s 
car. 

Will killing 558 more deer make 
her feel better?”

She concluded her remarks 

by saying, “everyone who votes 
for an increase in the cull 
tonight deserves to be voted off 
of City Council.”

In a vote of 10-1, the council 

voted in favor of the additional 
funds needed for the 2018 deer 

cull, with Mayor Christopher 
Taylor being the sole dissenting 
voice.

The council members also 

took time to vote on a resolution 
to decline pay increases in their 
salaries. The council rejected 
this resolution, accepting the 
pay increase. The council also 
declared the month of October 
Co-op Month in the city of Ann 
Arbor in honor of the work local 
co-ops do for the community.

potential of war with North 
Korea.

Gov. Rick Snyder and Bill 

Schuette, Michigan attorney 
general 
and 
gubernatorial 

candidate, 
were 
popular 

targets for the marchers. While 
marching, chants of “How do 
we spell Rick Snyder? C-o-r-r-
u-p-t” were common, and at the 
final destination, Liberty Plaza, 
protesters listened to activists 
deliver more fiery attacks on 
Snyder and Schuette.

Sandi Smith, an Ann Arbor 

business owner and the former 
president of the LGBTQ support 
group Jim Toy Community 
Center, spoke on Snyder and 
Schuette’s roles in the landmark 
court case DeBoer v. Snyder.

This case, which would be 

consolidated with others under 
the 
umbrella 
of 
Obergefell 

v. Hodges, led to marriage 
equality nationwide in a 2015 
Supreme Court decision. Snyder 
and Schuette argued in DeBoer 
v. Snyder that the Michigan law 
preventing same-sex couples 
from having joint adoptions 
should be upheld.

Smith blasted Snyder and 

Schuette for their positions in 
this case, saying that Schuette 
fought DeBoer v. Snyder all the 
way to the Supreme Court to 
deny people like residents April 
DeBoer and Jane Rowse the 
ability to protect their children.

“(DeBoer and Rowse) filed 

their case on January 23, 2012, 
in 
federal 
court. 
Michigan 

Attorney General Bill Schuette 
fought this case all the way to 
the Supreme Court, but he lost, 
of course,” Smith said.

Smith also spoke on the 

difficulties LGBTQ activists 
face in their fight toward 
equality, specifically singling 
out the state of Michigan for 
these hardships.

“I mean think about how 

easy it would have been … to 
give up,” she said. “April and 

Jane, with a house full of young 
children, each with full-time 
jobs, defending their moral 
standing as two lesbian moms 
that can raise children just as 
well as straight people, while 
their home state of Michigan, 
with our tax dollars, said that 
children raised by same-sex 
parents would be damaged for 
life.”

The 
remaining 
speakers 

included Nina Muckenthaler, 
the 
president 
of 
Michigan 

National 
Organization 

for Women, who spoke on 
what she sees as attacks on 
women’s rights by the Trump 
administration, 
and 
local 

activists, 
who 
spoke 
out 

against pipeline development 
in Washtenaw County and in 
other areas of Michigan.

The marchers’ spirits were 

also buoyed by local musicians 
and singers who performed 
classic protest anthems.

Mason 
Van 
Gieson, 

a member of the a cappella 
group 
Amazin’ 
Blue, 
sang 

John Lennon’s song “Imagine” 
and spoke on the benefits of 
marches like these.

“I think primarily it’s a really 

wonderful community-building 
experience,” Van Gieson said. 
“I think that there is something 

about — primarily for a peace 
march — there’s something 
about finding other people 
that are thinking the same 
things you’re thinking, having 
the same fears and the same 
exhaustions that you’re having, 
especially within the current 
political climate.”

line is so that people who want 
to make sure that our laws 
are enforced against illegal 
immigration can be called 
racists,” Spakovsky said.

Caplan 
argued 
law 

enforcement officials practice 
selective enforcement every 
day, giving the example of not 
giving a ticket to individuals 
going 56 mph on a 55-mph 
road. Caplan said this should 
also be applied to those who 
broke the law when crossing 
the border illegally.

“Illegal immigration should 

be stopped by making it legal,” 
Caplan said. “Maybe as Hans 
suggests, (resources) should 
go to trying to find criminal 
aliens instead, and violent 
criminal aliens, rather than 
worrying about people who 
are just coming over the 
borders to maybe work on a 
farm. And what’s the big deal? 
Why is that any worse than 
someone driving 56 miles per 
hour?” 

Spakovsky 
and 
Caplan 

debated the issue of the 
travel ban put in place by 
Trump, including its legality 
and 
justification. 
Caplan 

argued against the executive 
action, saying it’s very likely 
to be a Muslim ban, while 
Spakovsky argued the move 

was calculated, despite what 
many of its critics have said.

“There is a long process 

that you have to go through to 
get (a tourist visa from Iraq). 
Based upon the character 
that Trump has revealed, 
there is every reason to think 
this is just another effort to 
demagogue, to act like he 
really cares about a serious 
problem,” Caplan said.

“The countries that were 

picked, yeah, some of them 
were Muslim countries, but 
that’s because they’re (state 
sponsors of terrorists). The 
idea that this was somehow 
arbitrary and not correctly 
done is just wrong,” Spakovsky 
countered.

Spakovsky 
said 
illegal 

immigrants 
cost 
the 
U.S. 

taxpayer a great deal of money 
each year through not paying 
taxes and receiving federal 
and state assistance.

“Open 
borders 
where 

anyone can come in would 
cause tremendous chaos, and 
the cost of illegal immigration 
is very great,” Spakovsky said. 
“A couple of years ago, The 
Heritage Foundation actually 
did a study, and they looked 
at what would be the cost to 
American taxpayers if we 
provided amnesty to the 11 to 
12 million illegal aliens who 
are in the country according 
to DHS. The net cost to the 
American taxpayer … would 
be $6.3 trillion on top of the 

debt that we already have.”

The debate concluded with 

questions from the audience, 
who 
challenged 
both 

speakers’ 
views. 
Audience 

members asked about the rule 
of law and respecting those 
who have become naturalized 
citizens and what some regard 
as a lack of due process for 
undocumented residents.

Earlier 
last 
week, 

controversial speaker Charles 
Murray, 
author 
of 
“The 

Bell Curve,” which asserts 
differences in IQ based on 
race, spoke at the University 
of 
Michigan. 
The 
event 

was 
disrupted 
by 
student 

protesters, who played music, 
chanted and read newspapers 
while Murray spoke. 

LSA senior Jake Thorne, 

Michigan Review editor in 
chief, said he was happy 
with how the debate went, 
especially 
following 
the 

protests at the Charles Murray 
event.

“We and the University had 

talked a lot about whether 
there 
would 
be 
protests, 

especially with the Charles 
Murray event going on and 
things 
like 
that,” 
Thorne 

said. “We just took every 
precaution 
to 
make 
sure 

people were able to exercise 
their 
freedom 
of 
speech, 

exercise their concerns, but 
we wanted it to be done in a 
safe, and as equitable manner 
as possible.”

the sexual education curriculum 
in schools to ensure instruction 
includes 
medically 
accurate 

sexuality education that is age 
appropriate.

State 
Sen. 
Hoon-Yung 

Hopgood, D-Taylor, proposed the 
bill. The proposed curriculum 
seeks 
to 
better 
prepare 

adolescents to become sexually 
healthy adults.

“Research 
continues 
to 

show that comprehensive sex 
education, which teaches both 
abstinence and contraception, is 
most effective for young people. 
Youth who receive this kind 
of education are more likely to 
initiate sexual activity later in life 
and use protection correctly and 
consistently when they do become 
sexually active,” Hopgood said in 
a press release.

Currently, state law encourages 

an abstinence-only approach to 
sex education, which, the press 
release said, has not proved to 
be effective in increasing rates 
of abstinence despite $1.5 billion 
spent during the past decade on 

abstinence-only programs.

HB 5074: This bill seeks to 

amend the Income Tax Act of 
1967 to allow for student loan 
tax deductions, which reduces 
the amount of taxable income. 
The bill would permit taxpayers 
to deduct up to $5,000 for single 
filers and $10,000 for joint filers.

State 
Rep. 
Abdullah 

Hammoud, 
D-Dearborn, 

proposed the amendment, stating 
in a press release this bill will give 
some relief to students repaying 
loans.

“The cost of a college education 

has 
increased 
exponentially 

throughout 
the 
years. 
In 

addition to providing much-
needed tax relief, this bill 
would provide the state a tool 
to help retain our talent in a 
competitive market. In today’s 
economy, talent is the number 
one determinant for a major 
corporation selecting Michigan 
as a place to do business,” said 
Hammoud.

The bill only applies to those 

who attend college, both public 
and private, in the state of 
Michigan.

The storm

STEPHANIE MULLINGS | COLUMN

L

ast week, at the BET Hip 
Hop Awards, Eminem — 
notorious for his rare public 

appearances — surprised fans with 
a freestyle performance now titled 
“The Storm.” In it, the rap star rips 
President Donald Trump apart in a 
four-and-a-half-minute onslaught 
in which he expresses his utter 
rage about the actions of Trump’s 
executive office.

Eminem 
is 
not 
the 
only 

celebrity who has spoken out 
explicitly about Trump’s time in 
office. Comedian Kathy Griffith 
expressed 
similar 
sentiments 

when images of her holding 
Trump’s severed head surfaced 
online. 
Athletes 
like 
LeBron 

James, Stephen Curry and Colin 
Kaepernick 
have 
additionally 

expressed 
their 
thoughts 

regarding Trump through Twitter 
and other public platforms. The 
most recent and widely popular 
was James’s tweet referring to 
Trump as a “bum.”

These incidents pose questions: 

Is there a danger in becoming “too 
political?” Should there be pressure 
to take a side? Has remaining silent 
become ignorance? 

To keep it real, I struggle with 

these sorts of questions twice a 
week in my women’s studies course, 
and I am far from a celebrity, rapper 
or superstar athlete. This is my 
first women’s studies course, and I 
can say I was genuinely excited to 
partake in a new field of study at 
the beginning of the semester. But 
recently, my thoughts about it have 
been conflicted.

Let me start off by saying I am 

a woman, and a Black woman at 
that, so I am well versed in being 

a minority. Furthermore, I am 
completely abreast of women’s 
plight and oppression worldwide 
in today’s society.

However, I have a rather 

indifferent personality as well. Not 
to say that I feel indifferent toward 
the struggles of women, because 
that is not the case at all. I mean 
this as in you would not catch me 
wearing a pink p***y hat or at the 
feminist rallies and marches.

Again, it is not that I do not 

support the causes or hope for 
gender equality worldwide. I am 
just not the person to wear my 
ideologies, political affiliations or 
beliefs on my sleeve. I am rather 
anti-labels when it comes to 
politics. I have always used the 
word “indifference” to describe this 
aspect of my personality, but it was 
my entrance to this women’s studies 
course that altered the course of 
my thinking, seeing as I have been 
timid to identify as “feminist.”

I think my women’s studies 

course is great. I am learning 
brand new material and gaining 
a new insight and perspective. I 
am, as I have always been, pro-
Woman. However, I am a woman 
who listens to rap music which 
can use degrading and violent 
language toward women. I am 
a woman who plays the video 
game “Injustice,” in which female 
characters such as Catwoman 
or Harley Quinn are extremely 
sexualized. I am a woman who 
still watches movies in which the 
man saves the day and rescues the 
helpless damsel in distress. Does 
this make me feminist? Or not?

According to the discussion 

within my class community, it 

makes me not feminist, or at 
least a “bad” one. This really 
shook me. Here I am thinking: I 
support women’s movements, I 
understand the struggle and can 
see first hand examples of sexism, 
sexual 
harassment, 
violence 

and oppression as a result of the 
plague of our patriarchal society. I 
can even feel the marginalization 
as a minority myself, as I often 
fear for the safety of my own body 
or worry about my experience 
in the working world later in 
life. I just so happen to like Jay-
Z, DC Comics’ video games and 
romantic comedy movies as well. 
Is it this that precludes me from 
being considered a feminist?

Eminem, sports stars and other 

celebrities had the courage to speak 
out regarding their beliefs. When 
these questions and reflections 
arose in class contradicting my 
own beliefs, I remained silent — 
as I have about many of the other 
topics I have found questionable 
or at least worth viewing from 
a 
different 
perspective 
than 

have been addressed in class. 
This stems directly from my 
self-proclaimed 
“indifferent” 

mentality, in addition to my fear of 
being ostracized by my classmates 
because of my views.

I am not going to do a 

monstrous diss freestyle against 
my 
classmates 
or 
professor 

because we have differing views, 
as Eminem did about Donald 
Trump. I simply pose to offer 
other perspectives. So I guess this 
piece is my “Storm.”

’ve 
gotten 
a 
consistent 

eight hours of sleep the last 
couple of nights, and as I sit 

here typing at 8:47 p.m. 
on a Monday night, 
I still feel miserable. 
My bed is all I can 
think 
about. 
Being 

able to crawl into my 
soft sheets and close 
my eyes will certainly 
be the best part of my 
day. Yeah, I know this 
sounds pathetic. But 
let’s be honest — we’ve 
all been there. 

About 10 minutes ago, while 

fantasizing about sleep instead 
of studying for my biochemistry 
exam, I recalled a conversation I 
had with my friend this morning. 
He claimed he was having no 
trouble 
staying 
awake 
after 

pulling an all-nighter.

“I had to study for my calc 

exam today,” he said. “But I got 
a lot done last night. I’m actually 
feeling pretty confident now.”

At the time, I didn’t think 

much of what he said, but as I sit 
here barely able to keep my eyes 
open with “healthy” amounts of 
sleep, I can’t help but pity him. 
Pulling an all-nighter is like 
committing academic suicide.

Up until this summer, I had 

only pulled one or two all-
nighters in my life. But in the 
last few months, I’ve worked in a 
lab that requires its researchers 
to select a six-hour shift during 
the day or overnight. Because 
taking the 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. shift 
is a rite of passage, I subjected 
myself to the torture of one or 
two sleepless nights per week 
throughout the months of July 
and August.

Because I was also taking a 

class during the summer term, 
I would try to use these long 
nights to get ahead. And yeah, 
in the first couple of hours it’s 
possible to be productive. But 
once the clock hits 3 or 4 a.m., 
it’s over. Sure, it’s possible to feel 

awake if one’s veins are running 
with Red Bull, but the ability 
to comprehend and retain any 

information is lost. 

Unless 
one 

consistently 
sleeps 

all day and is awake 
all night, pulling an 
all-nighter is one 
of the worst things 
one can do for their 
body 
and 
mental 

state. 
According 

to 
Business 

Insider, 
sleep 

deprivation elevates 

cortisol levels, which in turn 
increases stress. It also inhibits 
concentration, harms working 
memory, hinders the ability 
to multitask and results in 
emotional instability. This is 
because — and I know it’s been 
said a million times — sleep 
is necessary for the brain to 
function properly.

While one thinks they’re 

being 
productive, 
possibly 

even 
experiencing 
feelings 

of euphoria — which, in my 
opinion, is simply the brain’s 
defense mechanism to mask 
misery — the only thing they’re 
working toward is a lower grade. 
Don’t believe me? Well, a study 
at St. Lawrence University in 
New York compared two groups 
of students who had different 
sleeping 
patterns. 
Group 
A 

regularly 
obtained 
sufficient 

amounts of sleep while Group 
B regularly pulled all-nighters. 
The average GPA of Group A 
was 3.1, while Group B had an 
average GPA of 2.9.

No matter what I did — take 

a nap before my shift, drink 
coffee or an energy drink, etc. — 
I always felt awful the morning 
after an all-nighter. While I 
wouldn’t necessarily feel tired, 
the world had an indescribable 
fuzziness to it. I would arrive 
at my 9 a.m. lecture, not 
remembering how I got there, 
and I would dream with my eyes 

open instead of paying attention 
to the professor. In the rare 
moments in which I mustered 
up the will to listen, I would still 
be confused even though I had 
studied the material for hours 
during my shift the night before.

I didn’t realize how inhibited 

I was after an all-nighter until I 
looked back on the experience. 
In the moment, I thought I could 
function normally, but I couldn’t. 
It’s scary to think that there are 
thousands of students and even 
professionals that try to carry 
out their day-to-day tasks while 
sleep-deprived. 
For 
example, 

sleep deprivation impairs the 
ability to drive nearly as much as 
consuming alcohol. According to 
the National Sleep Foundation, 
being awake for 18 hours makes 
one drive as if they had a blood 
alcohol level of 0.05. (A blood 
alcohol level of 0.08 is considered 
legally drunk.)

While neglecting sleep and 

pulling an all-nighter may seem 
like an appealing way to get a lot 
done, it’s not worth it. Though 
sleeping may take up time, it’s 
much healthier for the body 
and mind. If one needs to cram 
for an exam — which everyone 
does at some point — it’s better 
to go to bed and wake up early 
to study at 5 or 6 a.m. This way 
it’s possible to concentrate and 
retain information throughout 
most of the day.

The clock now reads 11:52 

p.m. Though I’m horrendously 
behind 
in 
biochem, 
forcing 

myself to stay up and study is 
not worth forgoing sleep and 
sabotaging my ability to think 
clearly 
tomorrow. 
Therefore, 

I’ve decided to go back to my 
apartment and crawl into bed. 
Yes, this is definitely the best 
part of the day. As I closed my 
eyes, I wondered how my friend 
did on his calculus test.

“T

wo, 
four, 
six, 

eight, who do we 
appreciate?” 
is 
a 

chant ingrained in the mind of 
every kid who played youth sports.

During my own youth soccer 

games, 
when 
the 
intense 

battle 
between 
eight-year-

old 
warriors 
concluded 
on 

the soccer field or baseball 
diamond, the coach (in all his 
middle-aged glory) would rally 
the troops together for the all-
important post-game huddle.

These talks were never about 

winning or losing. At such a 
young 
age, 
our 
competitive 

drive was emerging but not yet 
developed. What served as the 
points of emphasis were the 
universal principles of hard 
work, having fun and, most 
pertinent 
to 
my 
experience 

growing up, sportsmanship.

At first, the coach — always a 

parent of one of the kids on the 
team — would praise our efforts 
as if we had just completed 
a marathon, harping on the 
resilience and determination 
we 
showed 
despite 
the 

numerous kids who would run 
to the sidelines to find their 
mom mid-contest.

After this came the moment 

we had all been waiting for: a 
rowdy cheer signaling the end 
of a hard-fought battle, and 
the snacks and juice boxes we 
would so graciously accept for 
our efforts. As a member of the 
Warriors, we would recite the 
following cheer after facing the 
enemy, in this case the Tigers:

“Two, four, six, eight, who do 

we appreciate? Tigers, Tigers, 
go Tigers!”

What stands out is not the 

creativity or intensity of the 
cheer, but the content itself. Who 
do we appreciate? Not ourselves 
— the victors — but our opponents.

My dad, the coach of most 

of my American Youth Soccer 
Organization teams, instilled 
in me a sense of sportsmanship 
and respect through this and 
other gestures, like shaking 
the hands of every opponent 
and coach after the game. 
However, as I grew older 
and 
entered 
the 
world 
of 

competitive travel sports, this 
type of sportsmanship seemed 
to disappear completely.

Perhaps as a function of the 

natural selfishness that comes 
with 
sprouting 
adulthood, 

respectful 
competition 
and 

sportsmanship became clouded 
out by trash talk, aggression and 
even violence. It is this transition 
that I argue the integrity of 
all sports — from the youth to 
the professional sphere — has 
become compromised.

On Oct. 7, the University 

of 
Michigan 
played 
against 

Michigan State University in a 
highly-touted Big Ten rivalry 
battle. The last time the Spartans 
made the trip from East Lansing 
in 2015, things did not end well 
for the heavily-favored folks from 
Ann Arbor. In one of the most 
infamous finishes in Michigan 
football history, the Wolverines 
blew a surefire lead on a muffed 
punt as time ran out in the fourth 
quarter, leaving fans in a state of 
shock and disbelief.

What 
transpired 
two 

weekends 
ago, 
though 
less 

dramatic, 
proved 
similar 
to 

what happened in 2015 — a 
surprising 
Michigan 
loss 

fostered animosity on both sides, 
leading to an onslaught of insults 
and derogatory comments from 
Wolverine and Spartan fans.

As I walked back from the 

stadium that Saturday, soaked 
from the torrential downpour 
that drenched the Big House 
throughout the second half of 
the game, I heard (and tried to 
ignore) the barrage of insults 
being thrown at me from fans 
dressed in green and white. 
Biting my tongue, I remembered 
the lessons I learned as a kid of 
respect, sportsmanship and class.

But that does not hold true for 

some Michigan fans. Throughout 
the game day adventure that is a 
Saturday in Ann Arbor, I observed 
a variety of banners and posters 
taking jabs at Michigan State. My 
personal favorite was a massive 
20-by-5-foot artistic rendering 
of a common off-color joke that 
read, “Go green go white, can’t 
read can’t write.”

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m 

all for a little trash talk. I would 
be lying if I said I never mouthed 
off at the other team during my 
baseball career and once or twice 
got heated when an opponent 
started firing back.

But I also think a little trash 

talk goes a long way, and personal, 
derogatory insults are not the 
way to go about it. Attacking 
someone for their allegedly low 
intelligence because of a football 
game not only reveals something 
about the aggressor, but also 
about the growing classlessness 
and aggression of sports culture 
as a whole.

Even among athletes at the 

professional level, there have 
been 
numerous 
instances 
of 

this type of behavior. Athletes 
have departed from the lessons 
taught during youth sports so 
much that the NFL toughened up 
their policy on unsportsmanlike 
conduct 
penalties 
last 
year, 

which now includes offenses 
like taunting, fighting and using 
abusive language. 

Even 
more 
significantly, 

unsportsmanlike behavior on 
the field has served as a catalyst 
for negative fan behavior off the 
field and has enabled the world 
of professional sports to become 
a vessel for discrimination going 
on across the globe.

For example, in June 2016, 

the Union of European Football 
Associations 
soccer 
league 

made international news when a 
match between Croatia and the 
Czech Republic turned violent, 
with fans rioting after a series of 
“discriminatory chants” erupted. 
Though the fans were removed 
from the stadium and the situation 
diffused, their actions revealed 
that, for as much good as sports do 
for society (a topic that deserves an 
entire book on its own), stadiums 
are increasingly turning into sites 
for verbal and physical assaults on 
fans and players.

All of this is to say that college 

and professional sports have 
strayed from the core values 
imparted on us as kids. Though 
the 
transition 
to 
adulthood 

contains its inevitable moments 
of rebelliousness and aggression, 
it has turned into an epidemic 
that 
has 
compromised 
the 

integrity of sports.

No, I don’t expect Michigan 

fans to hug their East Lansing 
counterparts after a loss, but a 
little respect goes a long way.

FLORIAN KOPPE

Edgefest’s second day to 
feature soulful jazz shows

Day two of Edgefest will 

host a wide variety of jazz 
performances. Read on for 
a preview of some what the 
event will be showcasing this 
Wednesday.

—
Jonathan 

Taylor Quintet: 
Mover

6:00 p.m.
An 
alum 
of 

the 
University, 

Detroit-based 
drummer 
and 

percussionist 
Jon 
Taylor 

is 
bringing 

Mover 
to 

Kerrytown. The 
composer’s band 
— 
consisting 

of 
himself, 

Marcus 
Elliot 

(saxophone), 
Michael 
Malis 

(piano), 
Jarbu 

Shahid (bass) and Molly Jones 
(violin / saxophone) — is both 
eclectic and improvisational. 
Mover 
articulates 
their 

rhythms 
while 
shifting 

effortlessly 
through 
their 

sound. Coming on at 6 p.m., 
the group is set to lead 
Edgefest’s Thursday lineup.

William 
Hooker 
Duo 

featuring Michael Malis

7:00 p.m.

Drummer William Hooker 

and pianist Mike Malis (Malis 
will also play with Mover) will 
follow the quintet. Hooker 
has been developing his music 
since 
the 
mid-seventies. 

Dramatic and intimate, he 
uses tension to tell a distinctly 
human tale through his work. 
Malis, who’s currently getting 
his Master’s in composition 

at Wayne State 
University, 
will 

accompany him. 
His jazz is calmer 
than 
Hooker’s, 

slowly escalating 
to glide through 
a story. They’re 
different enough 
that, when put 
together, they’re 
sure to craft a 
stunning sound.

Joseph Daley 

Tuba Trio

8:00 p.m.
Brought 
by 

Joseph 
Daley’s 

Tuba 
Trio, 

“The Tuba Trio 
Chronicles” is a 

dedication to Daley’s friend 
and mentor Sam Rivers. It will 
be performed by Daley (tuba), 
Warren 
Smith 
(percussion) 

and Scott Robinson (reeds). 
Rivers was known for his 
Avant-jazz style of music, and 
the “Chronicles” is a reflection 
of that. Daley is adventurous 
in 
his 
sound, 
one 
stroke 

dangerous and three strokes 
heart-thumping. Set for 8 p.m., 

the Trio is guaranteed to make 
for a memorable performance.

Allison Miller’s Boom Tic 

Boom 

9:00 p.m.
Featured on NPR’s Tiny 

Desk series in 2012, Boom 
Tic Boom consists of front-
gal Allison Miller (drums), 
Jenny 
Scheinman 
(violin), 

Carmen Staaf (piano), Kirk 
Knuffke (cornet), Jeff Lederer 
(clarinet) and Todd Sickafoose 
(bass). On her own, Miller 
has toured with folk-rocker 
Brandi Carlile and sat in with 
the 8G Band, “Late Night With 
Seth Meyers”’s house band. 
She’s built Boom Tic Boom’s 
sound to be boastful, groovy 
and really, really fun. They’re 
an experienced bunch, and 
it shows in their graceful 
rhythms and easy flow. Playing 
at 9 p.m., Boom Tic Boom will 
round out Edgefest’s Thursday 
night.

Amir ElSaffar to bring 
maqam to Power Center

This 
Wednesday, 
Iraqi-

American 
trumpeter, 
vocalist 

and composer Amir ElSaffar will 
take the Power Center stage to 
perform selections from his newest 
project, Rivers of Sound. With an 
international, 
17 

musician ensemble 
— 
the 
largest 

group he has ever 
led — ElSaffar is 
expanding 
upon 

a concept that he 
explored 
in 
his 

preceding 
album: 

Combining 
Iraqi 

and Arabic maqam 
music with jazz.

“This 
project 

is 
much 
more 

specific in terms of 
combining 
these 

two 
elements,” 

ElSaffar said in an 
interview with The 
Michigan Daily.

Maqam, an Arabic modal system 

used in traditional Iraqi music, has 
had influences and variations all 
over the world, from the Middle 
East to Morocco, from Turkey to 
North Africa, from Central Asia 
to Europe. In Iraq, however, it 
is something very specific and 
special, for it is part of a local 
Baghdadi tradition that dates back 
to the medieval era — the glory days 
of Baghdad.

Similar to jazz, maqam is largely 

improvisational, yet both styles use 
notes and musical ideas that do not 
even exist to the other. ElSaffar’s 
vision of fusion continues to come 
into fruition through hands-on 
discoveries and experiences.

“For 
instance,” 
ElSaffar 

explained, “in jazz you have 
harmonies and chordal structures 
called vertical structures that don’t 
exist in Arabic music, and there 

are 
some 
other 

pitches in Iraqi and 
Middle 
Eastern 

music 
that 
don’t 

exist in the Western 
scales. With some 
research and some 
digging in, we start 
to discover pitches 
and rhythms that 
are common, and 
we start to find the 
universals in music 
that appear in most, 
if not all, musical 
traditions; 
these 

universals have to 
do with the physics 
of 
sound, 
and 

overtone 
theories, 

and how acoustics and sounds 
behave. These are things that are 
present in every musical tradition 
that I’ve encountered.”

Becoming fluent in both jazz 

and Iraqi music has been a life’s 
work for ElSaffar. Born in Chicago 
to an American mother and an 
Iraqi father, his curiosity and 
understanding of the importance 
of exploring his own culture 
urged him to return to Iraq — his 
trip, coincidentally, immediately 

followed September 11th, 2001.

His time in Iraq antedated 

the U.S. invasion in Iraq and 
commencement 
of 
the 
war, 

but only just. His experiences 
overseas, 
especially 
during 

such a politically charged time, 
solidified the profundity of music’s 
transcendental abilities that holds 
just as much importance today.

“Only after going through that 

rigorous process of fully engaging 
with the music language, could I 
then come to the other side and 
see where the real shared essences 
were,” ElSaffar said of his time 
abroad. “And at that point, it really 
became clear to me where the 
universality of music lies, which 
is in the intention, and the feeling, 
and the emotion being expressed. 
It’s in the ideas; the philosophical 
approach to the world. It’s the 
universal truths that permeate 
every religious or philosophical 
tradition that we encounter. We see 
that the same truths emerge, but 
they are cloaked in different garb. 
But their essences are the same.”

“I’ve had great experiences 

with UMS — I love the staff there, 
as well as the auditorium and the 
audiences. It’s a special place. Not 
just me, but all of my musician 
friends know that UMS is one of 
the great presenters of music in the 
country, so it’s always a pleasure to 
come back,” ElSaffar said.

ElSaffar is also performing 

on Friday for UMS’s production, 
Written in Water with the Ragamala 
Dance Company, of which he is also 
the musical director and composer.

FESTIVAL REVIEW
Chicago Int’l Film Fest: Day 1

COURTESY PHOTO

Few 
films 
attack 

humanitarian crises with the 
fervor and ferocity of “BPM 
(Beats Per Minute),” which 
follows a group of AIDS 
activists in Paris in the early 
1990s. The film, directed by 
Robin 
Campillo 
(“Eastern 

Boys”), borrows equally from 
the social consciousness of 
contemporary 
European 

filmmakers and from the 
large-scope examinations of 
communities 
by 
American 

filmmakers 
like 
Robert 

Altman and Paul Thomas 
Anderson.

At its center are various 

members of the Paris branch 
of ACT UP, an organization 
started in New York to bring 
attention 
to 
HIV/AIDS 

victims with demonstrations 
led by positive and negative 
members 
alike. 
Their 

lives 
intersect 
in 
weekly 

meetings, in the subway, at 
demonstrations, and, in the 
film’s most tender moments, 
in bedrooms. The film is 
bookended by two acts of 
protest (with a third that 
anchors the first half) — the 
first, in the film’s first shots, 
leads into a sort of post-
mortem to discern whether 
the 
protest, 
which 
takes 

several turns, was a success, 
in an all-too-rare cinematic 
exploration of the efficacy of 
certain protest methods; the 
powerful ending largely serves 
as catharsis, both for the 

participants and the audience, 
and its very power reveals 
how much we care about 
these characters, drawn not 
with lazy exhibition but with 
vibrantly colored actions.

Though at 144 minutes 

the film’s patience combined 
with its heavy subject matter 
may turn some off, but this 
is, ultimately, a movie about 
flamboyant 
20-somethings 

in the Love Capital of the 
World. It’s almost engineered 
to be endlessly fascinating. 
With a foot-tapping score 
by Arnaud Rebotini of the 
band Black Strobe, drawn 
from the Eurobeat heard in 
discothèques at the time, 
Campillo’s fascination with 
both the never-ending debate 
over how best to achieve social 
goals and the effervescent 
rave culture at the time make 
“BPM” a worthy watch.

“The Workshop,” the latest 

film from French director 
Laurent Cantet (“The Class”), 

also confronts contemporary 
political discussions, but lacks 
the nuance and assuredness of 
“BPM.” The film, co-written 
by Cantet and Campillo (the 
two have collaborated on a 
number of films together), 
focuses 
on 
a 
writing 

workshop in a small town in 
southern France. There, a 
diverse group of about eight 
young adults collaborate on 
writing a thriller, guided by 
their moderately successful 
novelist instructor (Marina 
Foïs, “Irréprochable”).

The film starts by following 

one of the students, Antoine 
(first-timer 
Matthieu 

Lucci), who spends his days 
swimming and working out. 
We’re 
initially 
drawn 
to 

Antoine — the film follows him 
after all — but soon we begin 
to be repelled. It starts with 
suggesting an Arab or black 
villain in their thriller novel, 
and then a casual invocation 
of the 2015 terrorist attacks at 

the Bataclan in Paris, which 
he weaponizes against an 
Arab classmate. We then see 
he regularly views videos 
by figures in the French 
equivalent of the “alt-right.”

From there, the film shifts in 

its viewpoint to the instructor, 
who not so subtly confronts 
Antoine for his views. At 
the workshop, the students 
dance around the subject, 
but 
Antoine 
seems 
ready 

to play: he’s willing to talk 
about the genre’s fascination 
with killing, despite what he 
perceives to be authors’ lack 
of 
emotional 
involvement. 

Cantet’s film wades into the 
murky waters of an important 
political conversation with 
a mildly interesting vantage 
point, splashes some water 
around and gets out before 
actually saying anything of 
importance.

THE CW

‘Jane the Virgin’ becomes 
Adam the Virgo in S4 shift

Ah, friends. We begin again 

with our Jane, or wait a second… 
our Adam? Season four of CW’s 
“Jane the Virgin” opens not with 
the show’s namesake, but with 
one Adam Eduardo 
Alvaro 
(Tyler 

Posey, “Teen Wolf”) 
instead — Jane’s 
teenage love, with 
his 
own 
sultry-

speaking 
narrator 

in tow. Viewers met 
Adam in the season 
three finale when 
he 
brought 
Jane 

(Gina 
Rodriguez, 

“Deepwater Horizon”) a letter 
Michael had written for her and 
stuffed away in the floorboards 
of their old house. Season four 
now premieres with our new 
female narrator, voiced by Vanessa 
Marshall, setting the scene for Jane 
and Adam’s romance from his side 
of the story.

Adam was a tenant of the house 

Jane and Michael (Brett Dier, 
“Ravenswood”) once lived, where 
he discovered what he believes 
to be a stranger’s love note. Cut to 
three years later, Adam discovers 
that this letter was written to none 
other than our Jane, who, as Adam’s 
narrator mentions, he proposed to 
when he was 19 years old.

A season premiere beginning 

with a brand-new character in the 
place of the protagonist — even 
going as far as to replace her title 
sequence with his own, “Adam the 
Virgo” — seems jarring as a season 
kick-off to a show named for its 
main character. However, I believe 
the writers knew they needed to 
give this new love interest a grand 
entrance to nestle him in the hearts 

of viewers.

Once Jane’s narrator regains 

the reigns on the episode, we find 
out that Jane and Adam decide to 
get engaged when he receives his 
acceptance to NYU — only to have 
their love story cut short when 
Adam calls off the engagement 
on 
their 
wedding 
day. 
They 

don’t see each other again until 

they’re 
reunited 

by Michael’s letter, 
almost 
10 
years 

later.

The 
existence 

of 
this 
new 

heartthrob 
and 

this 
novel-worthy 

tale 
of, 
“finding 

their 
way 
back,” 

seems to blossom 
out of thin air. 65 

“chapters” in, “Jane the Virgin” has 
stretched each character’s plot line 
so thin, the writers were forced to 
backpedal and retroactively create 
a new gamechanger: Jane’s real 
first love.

While telenovelas don’t always 

adhere to the realm of believability, 
the torrid tale of teen Jane and 
Adam was out of character for our 
protagonist, who was laboriously 
painted as responsible and even-
minded 
throughout 
the 
past 

seasons – even in her childhood 
 

flashbacks. The fact that Jane’s 
relationship with love thus far in 
the show was seemingly unaffected 
by a broken engagement in her 
teen years is quite a reach in her 
character build.

The one saving grace of the 

Adam plotline, however, is the 
introduction of his female, sharp-
tongued narrator. The show’s 
main narrator usually provides 
comic relief from the sometimes 
emotionally exhausting pace of a 
telenovela and, as he says himself, 
helps “shape the story.” With 
Adam’s narrator playing catch up to 

all the entangled storylines, she acts 
as the voice of the skeptic viewer. 
She adds an air of self-deprecation 
to the show, helping the show mock 
its own downfalls, like highlighting 
the use of classic telenovela ploys. 
“You led me to believe Rafael was 
into Jane, with all the misleading 
push-ins and long glances,” she 
shoots at the male narrator.

Sometimes when a show is too 

self-aware, it can feel too much 
like you’re sitting in the writers’ 
room, hearing their gears turn; this 
narrators acknowledgment of the 
soap operas downfalls, however, 
keeps the show treading the line 
between good TV and your 
grandma’s soaps.

Another 
way 
that 
Adam’s 

narrator underlined an inherent 
weakness in the Jane empire 
was by speaking for the first time 
viewer, trying to conceive such 
long winded, twisted character 
arcs, since she is brought in three 
seasons deep. As I sat watching 
the premiere with my mother — 
who tuned out at season two — I 
had to pause consistently to have 
sufficient time to explain how our 
characters had gotten here.

My continuation with the show 

is, in no part, thanks to these now 
overused tangential plots, but 
rather that I’ve come to want the 
best for Jane as if she was a dear 
friend. And there is something to 
be said about writing that makes 
you tune in again solely to feed 
your attachment to a character. 
While my loin-driven loyalty will 
always remain with Jane’s baby 
daddy and their happy ending, 
perhaps 
if 
Adam’s 
emphatic 

introduction is any sign, I could 
learn to love again. After all, 
there’s one thing this season 
premiere laid out for certain – at 
least for one strand of the greater 
thread of Jane’s world – we will 
see more of Adam.

It’s 
October, 
and 
we’re 

quickly 
coming 
up 
on 

Halloween. 
That 
can 
only 

mean one thing…

Just 
kidding. 
It 
means 

a lot of things. There are 
the 
changing 
leaves 
and 

landscapes, and the familiar 
tastes of fall flavors like apple, 
pumpkin and cinnamon. If 
you’re like me, though, what 
you’re really thinking about 
these days is horror. Scary 
movies, scary costumes and, of 
course, haunted houses.

We’ve seen a lot of haunted 

houses in horror fiction. Even 
when the narrative doesn’t 
revolve 
specifically 
around 

the house, it’s often there, or 
there’s some part of the story 
in which the characters have 
to enter one. It’s one of the 
narratives that those of us who 
enjoy horror usually enjoy the 
most: a creepy, isolated house 
full of closed doors, dark 

rooms and basements, creaky 
floorboards and secrets.

One of the most enduring 

haunted house stories is The 
Haunting of Hill House by 
Shirley Jackson. You might 
know Jackson already from 
“The Lottery,” that grim short 
story a lot of us had to read 
in middle or high school. In 
The Haunting of Hill House, 
she constructs a mesmerizing 
story about an evil house 
with an evil history, and the 
dark events that unfold when 
four very different people — a 
scientist, a thief, a flamboyant 
artist and a quiet woman with 
a dark past — spend a week 
there together.

Like many other frightening 

stories, this book can best be 
understood as an accumulation 
of 
horrors. 
There’s 
your 

typical fun pack of ghost-
story scares: ominous writing 

appearing on the walls, doors 
slamming shut for no reason, 
clothes 
appearing 
covered 

in blood. These are all scary, 
but strangely, none of them 
hit home quite the way the 
book’s psychological elements 
do. The nighttime scenes and 
interactions 
between 
the 

characters propel the readers 
to ask disturbing questions: 
Whose hand was the character 
holding in the darkness, if not 
her friend’s? Can the narrator 
even be trusted, or has she 

fallen 
too 
far 
under 
the 

house’s influence? In terms 
of psychological horror, it 
doesn’t get much more spine-
tingling than that.

Of course, as I said, there 

are a ton of different haunted 
house stories out there. The 
reason I’m choosing to focus on 
this one is because it’s a great 
example of horror literature, 
and there’s no better time to 
talk about horror literature 
than Halloween season.

Shirley Jackson is one of 

a host of writers — Bram 
Stoker and Mary Shelley are 
good 
historical 
examples, 

Stephen King if you’re looking 
for someone more recent — 
whose names are very much 
tied to the genre of horror. 
The names are famous and 
widely recognized, but it’s 
this 
attachment 
to 
genre 

that fascinates me. There’s 
a 
tendency 
among 
people 

to look down upon famous 
works and writers of horror, 
sometimes 
without 
even 

realizing that they’re doing it, 
because horror is considered 
genre fiction. It falls alongside 
science fiction and fantasy; it’s 
good, maybe, but it’s not great 
— it’s not “literary.” Its quality 
derives from the fact that it’s 
pulpy and popular.

Of course, to dig into this 

issue, one sort of needs to ask 
the question of what “literary” 
means to begin with, which 
is an enormous rabbit hole 
all on its own. To me, though, 
it seems clear that works 
like The Haunting of Hill 
House are meritorious and 
impactful. It was published 
in 
1959, 
which 
makes 
it 

relatively recent as far as the 
ghost stories of history go, 
but it still provided a template 

for many terror-based and 
psychological haunted house 
stories to come. Even on a 
broader literary scale, it tells 
a captivating story that delves 
deep within the psyche of its 
narrator 
and 
convincingly 

captures emotions like envy, 
hatred, hope, uncertainty and 
distrust, which all affect us in 
our everyday lives.

The debate could go on for 

years — and, to some extent,

Citizen to perform release 
show at St. Andrew’s Hall

ARTIST INTERVIEW

At this point in their career, 

Citizen has reached an almost 
cult-like status. With roots in the 
angry, aggressive side of pop punk, 
fans quickly flocked to the band. 
However, each of their releases 
has marked growth for a band 
unwilling to remain stagnant, and 
on their third album As You Please 
we find Citizen in a full melodic 
bloom. Where sophomore record 
Everybody Is Going to Heaven, 
while gorgeously arranged, was 
sonically 
demanding, 
As 
You 

Please feels less jarring, more fluid 
and effortlessly captivating.

This Thursday, October 19th, 

Citizen will be headlining a record 
release show at Saint Andrew’s 
Hall in Detroit while on tour with 
Sorority Noise and Great Grandpa. 
The Michigan Daily recently spoke 
to guitarist Nick Hamm about the 
tour, changes to their live show and 
the reception of their phenomenal 
new record.

The Michigan Daily: I keep 

seeing the Detroit show referred 
to as the record release show. Do 
you guys have anything special 
planned for that date?

Hamm: 
Oddly 
enough, 
we 

generally do our record release 
shows in Toledo, but this time 
around logistically we weren’t able 
to. So, we decided to do the record 
release in Detroit, but we’re going 
to donate a portion of the proceeds 
to the Toledo public schools 
foundation. And I’m excited about 
that, because we feel a bit guilty. So 
many shows pass over Toledo, so 
we’re excited to be able to, I don’t 
know, make up to Toledo a little 
bit. So that’s probably the most 
special thing we have planned 
for it. It’s also going to be the first 
show that we’re showcasing, like, 
some production that we’re doing 
that’s nothing we’ve done before. 
We’re kind of excited to break in 
this new kind of style of Citizen 
show.

TMD: Could you touch on 

specifics? Are you adding lights to 
the show or instruments for the 
production of the album?

Hamm: The most noticeable 

difference with the new album 
and the new live show is that we’ve 
added keys into the mix. So now, 
you know, that’s a very new thing 
to see Mat (Kerekes, vocalist) up 
there playing a keyboard. And 
additionally, we have some lights 
and things like that that we’re 
going to be trying out. Hopefully 

there’s no bumps in the road as far 
as that goes. We’re excited about it, 
so hopefully people enjoy it.

TMD: In your recent interview 

with New Noise Magazine, you 
said that there was a pushback 
on the new sound on Everybody 
Is Going to Heaven. How has the 
reception with As You Please been 
compared to your sophomore 
record?

Hamm: 
It’s 
been 

overwhelmingly positive. I really 
don’t think we’ve ever released 
anything that has had such an 
immediate 
positive 
response. 

Touching back on the Everybody 
Is Going to Heaven thing, you 
know, we had a very clear vision 
for that album and a very clear 
sense of how polarizing it might 
be, coming off of such a different 
record with our debut. This time 
around we knew people would 
— you know, it’d be a little less 
polarizing — we knew that people 
would like it. But we really had 
no idea that people would be as 
receptive and as responsive as 
they have been so far. So, it’s super 
exciting after having an album that 
people either loved or hated, it’s 
kind of nice to have this record out 
and seemingly anyone that hears it 
is really excited about it.

TMD: With the tour starting 

tomorrow, are there any songs 
you’re excited or nervous about 
playing live for the first time?

Hamm: Yeah, we’re doing a 

new song called “Control,” and I 
think ever since we first wrote the 
song we’ve been really anxious 
to be able to play it live. So, we’ve 
been practicing that one pretty 
diligently, just making sure it’s 
perfect before we unveil it. That’s 
probably the one I’m most excited 
to play.

TMD: I know you’ve toured 

with Sorority Noise a few times 
at this point, and they were really 
well received at your headlining 
show with Turnover. Could you 
tell me a little bit about your 
touring experience with them and 
the addition of Great Grandpa as 
the opener?

Hamm: So we first toured 

with Sorority Noise in 2016 with 
Turnover, and we didn’t really 
know them at that point. We 

knew their singer Cam (Boucher) 
through mutual friends, but we 
just really love touring with them. 
They not only are just a really cool 
band, but they’re great people. 
They also just know everything 
about gear, and they’ve helped us 
with little things like that along the 
way. If I’m having technical issues, 
I just ask one of them about it and 
they generally know what it is. 
They’re super fun to have on tour 
with because they’re so positive 
and friendly. But they’re also just 
so helpful, and they don’t ask for 
anything in return. They’re just 
really cool people to be able to tour 
with. And as for Great Grandpa, 
I had not heard of the before we 
started routing the tour, and I’m 
friends with their booking agent 
Greg Horbal, and he suggested 
them so we all listened to them. 
There were a few other options 
in the mix, and we all just really 
liked it and thought they were a 

really cool band. Unfortunately 
for them, they have to drive all the 
way from Seattle to meet up with 
the tour, but they immediately said 
yes to doing the tour. Obviously, it 
doesn’t always work out that way, 
but immediately they were down 
and it seems like it’s going to be 
really cool getting to know them 
and watch them every night.

TMD: How would you describe 

a Citizen show to someone who 
has never heard of Citizen before?

Hamm: I would say first and 

foremost that it’s dynamic. I think 
that describes it pretty perfectly. 
There’s moments that are pretty 
chaotic and loud, and then there’s 
moments that are really calm and 
really pretty, for lack of a better 
word. So, I think that it’s something 
that not every band offers, and I’m 
pretty proud of the way we handle 
the dynamics throughout our set. I 
think that’s probably the best word 
to describe it.

BLOOMINGTON — The 10 
yards could have made all the 
difference. 
With just over a minute 
left to play, the Wolverines 
were clinging to a 20-17 lead 
when freshman Brad Robbins 
launched a 45-yard punt. But 
Michigan was called for a 
holding penalty, moving the ball 
up to Indiana’s 30-yard line. 
The Hoosiers pieced together 
three receptions and left two 
seconds on the clock. Though 
Michigan tried to ice him, 
kicker Griffin Oakes nailed a 
46-yard field goal to send the 
game to overtime.
Behind the efforts of junior 
running back Karan Higdon 
and the Wolverines’ defense, 
the No. 17 Michigan football 
team (2-1 Big Ten, 5-1 overall) 
escaped the overtime period 
with 
a 
27-20 
victory 
over 
Indiana (0-3, 3-3).

But throughout the day, there 
was good reason to be worried. 
Michigan may not have turned 
the ball over, but the Wolverines 
certainly held themselves back.
They 
were 
called 
for 
a 
season-high 
16 
penalties, 
totaling 141 yards. The most 
costly of which came at the end 
of the second half. It could have 
cost Michigan the game, too.
That’s where Higdon and 
the 
defense 
came 
in. 
The 
Wolverines received the ball 
first and took all of one play 
to find the end zone. Though 
Higdon 
looked 
stuffed, 
he 
managed to bounce around to 
the outside and run 25 yards for 
the touchdown.
“I’m going to be honest, I 
went the wrong way on that 
play,” said fifth-year senior 
center 
Patrick 
Kugler. 
“I 
messed up. (But) when you have 
a back like Karan, he’s going to 
make you right sometimes.”
Indiana then had a chance to 
answer back, and it almost did. 
The Hoosiers made it all the 

way to the one-yard line, but 
Michigan’s defense wouldn’t let 
them go any farther.
On four consecutive plays, 
the 
Wolverines 
racked 
up 
two tackles-for-loss and an 
incompletion before sealing the 
deal with an interception from 
junior safety Tyree Kinnel.
“We (were) going to have to 
dig down deep to do it,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“The goal-line stand was great, 
an opportunity for us to keep 
them out of the end zone and 
win the ballgame.”
Added fifth-year senior John 
O’Korn: “We trust our defense. 
They continue to get the job 
done. … There’s never any doubt 
about that in any of our minds.”
Though it took until overtime 
to finally finish off Indiana, 
Higdon thought he had already 
staked Michigan to a decisive 
lead in the fourth quarter.
At the start of the second 
half, the Hoosiers had forced a 
three-and-out and then drove 
64 yards for a touchdown to cut 

the Wolverines’ lead to 13-10. 
But with 10 minutes left to play, 
Higdon broke through a gaping 
hole in the middle for a 59-yard 
touchdown. 
At that moment, Michigan 
thought it could finally breathe 
a sigh of relief. It couldn’t.
With 
four 
minutes 
left, 
Indiana returned a punt 53 
yards 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
20-yard 
line. 
Quarterback 
Peyton Ramsey threw an eight-
yard touchdown pass to bring 
the 
Hoosiers 
within 
three 
again. 
After an onside kick went 
Michigan’s way, it went three-
and-out and was forced to punt. 
The ensuing penalty could have 
been devastating. 
And there were plenty of 
penalties that could have cost 
the Wolverines on Saturday. 
Out of 16 total, 11 — amounting 
to 98 yards — came in the first 
half alone.
Michigan could have had a 
touchdown in the first quarter, 
after fifth-year senior tackle 

Maurice 
Hurst 
blocked 
a 
51-yard field goal attempt and 
sophomore cornerback Lavert 
Hill returned it 35 yards to the 
Hoosiers’ 27-yard line.
But the Wolverines wasted 
their 
gifted 
field 
position. 
Higdon rushed for a 10-yard 
gain, but it was negated by a 
holding penalty. Immediately 
afterward, the offensive line 
was called for a false start. 
Suddenly, Michigan was backed 
up to Indiana’s 42-yard line.
Though Higdon then rushed 
for 22 yards on consecutive 
carries, the Wolverines had to 
settle for a 38-yard field goal 
on 4th-and-3 from redshirt 
freshman kicker Quinn Nordin 
— his second of the game — 
after Michigan’s offense stalled 
in the red zone.
But the most costly penalty of 
the first half went against the 
Hoosiers. As fifth-year senior 
quarterback 
John 
O’Korn 
scrambled on 1st-and-10 near 
the beginning of the second 
quarter, 
Indiana 
linebacker 

Tegray 
Scales 
was 
flagged 
for a late hit. The penalty 
moved the Wolverines to the 
Hoosiers’ 
28-yard 
line 
and 
Higdon took care of the rest — 
rushing 16 yards up the middle 
before completing a 12-yard 
touchdown run to the outside 
to put Michigan up 13-0.
Still, 16 penalties are usually 
a recipe for disaster. For much 
of the game, it looked like the 
Wolverines were heading right 
toward it. 
“Those are some of the 
things we have to grow (from) 
and improve on,” Harbaugh 
said. “Just keep coaching, just 
keep talking about it, just keep 
learning from it.
“… It’s a process. We gotta 
become 
a 
more 
disciplined 
football team.”
Though Michigan managed 
to escape relatively unscathed 
Saturday, with a contest against 
No. 3 Penn State just a week 
away, the Wolverines will need 
to clean up their mistakes in a 
hurry.

The 94-word blueprint for an upset

I

t was an honest, inward 
reflection. Asked to evalu-
ate his play through the 

last two weeks — performances 
that have yielded 256 yards 
and three 
intercep-
tions with a 
47.3 percent 
completion 
rate — fifth-
year senior 
quarter-
back John 
O’Korn took 
accountabil-
ity.

“I need 

to pick it up, there’s no way 
around it,” he said. “Definitely 
not up to my own goals and 
aspirations. I need to pick it up, 
simple as that.”

Not long after, O’Korn was 

asked if the postgame conver-
sations with Jim Harbaugh, 
offensive coordinator Tim 
Drevno and passing game coor-
dinator Pep Hamilton focus 
on the broader statistics of the 
passing game.

“I don’t think I’m very con-

cerned about the stats and I 
don’t think they are either,” he 
said. “What they want me to 
do is manage the game, man-
age the offense and things like 
delay of games and turnovers 
can’t happen. You saw the turn-
overs improve at Indiana, now 
we just gotta manage the play 
clock a little bit better.

“Like I said, just hit guys 

when they’re open, execute 
the plays that are called. Our 
run game’s rolling, our defense 
is rolling. It’s on us as a unit, 
quarterbacks and receivers, to 
pick it up.”

And there it was: 94 words, 

and the blueprint for an upset 
in State College.

Everything O’Korn said was 

correct. Michigan’s defense 
still tops the national rankings. 
The Wolverines’ run game 

— after junior running back 
Karan Higdon posted Michi-
gan’s first 200-yard rushing 
performance since Denard 
Robinson’s in 
2012 — looks 
alive and well.

With a 

matchup 
against the 
second-ranked 
Nittany Lions 
beckoning, 
though, there 
is no avoiding 
it: the passing 
offense mus-
tered just 58 yards and 2.9 yards 
per attempt against Indiana. 
Those stats should be concern-
ing. O’Korn does need to step 
up, but it doesn’t fall solely on 
his shoulders and the Wolver-

ines don’t need him to play 
hero — no matter how enticing 
that may be for a Pennsylvania 
native who grew up 45 minutes 

from Beaver Sta-
dium and whose 
mom works as a 
waitress in State 
College serving 
Penn State players 
and the coaches’ 
wives.

More simply, 

they need him to 
take what comes 
to him.

Harbaugh 

admitted that Penn State 
doesn’t give up many big plays. 
Through six games, the Nittany 
Lions have allowed just three 
scores of 20-plus yards — all 
against Iowa.

Michigan, on the other 

hand, has lived on them. Of the 
Wolverines’ 13 offensive touch-
downs, seven have come on 
plays of 25-plus 
yards.

The key, 

then, is in 
O’Korn’s own 
words. He 
needs to man-
age the game. 
He needs hit 
the open receiv-
er. It sounds 
simple, but that 
doesn’t make it 
any less true.

Harbaugh wouldn’t directly 

address if he formulates an 
offensive game plan catered 
toward avoiding risk and play-
ing to his defense’s strengths.

“Play to win the game,” he 

said. “It’s every week though. 
I’d say it was emphasized this 
week, but it’s emphasized every 

week with our 
offense.”

In this case, 

though, playing 
to win the game 
revolves around 
the Wolverines’ 
defense. It’s cen-
tered on the run 
game too.

With his per-

formance against 
Indiana, Higdon 

made the case that he can be a 
workhorse back for Michigan. 
And if he can’t, Chris Evans 
and Ty Isaac are waiting in the 
wings. Either way, the Wol-
verines have the capability to 

shorten the game against the 
Nittany Lions.

As for Michigan’s defense — 

which will now be tasked with 
stopping running back Saquon 
Barkley — it is holding oppo-
nents to just 82.1 yards on the 
ground per game, good for sixth 
in the nation.

Even with this defensive 

unit, though, there’s only so 
many times Barkley can have 
the ball in his hands before he 
burns you. And even if Barkley 
doesn’t burn them, quarterback 
Trace McSorley will.

“You’ve got to keep them off 

the field,” Higdon said. “You’ve 
got to keep their playmakers off 
the field, and that’s how we’re 
gonna thrive in this game.”

Which circles things back to 

O’Korn.

Missing a wide-open Dono-

van Peoples-Jones on a would-
be 60-yard touchdown didn’t 
come back to bite the Wolver-
ines against Indiana. Making 
the same mistake against Penn 
State will. Those opportunities 
will be few and far between.

But throwing to Kekoa Craw-

ford in double coverage, as he 
also did against the Hoosiers, is 
asking for a turnover — the one 
thing that could take away this 
defense’s leverage.

Maintaining that leverage 

and keeping the game simple 
enough to play to the Wolver-
ines’ strengths will be crucial in 
State College. If O’Korn makes 
his reads, hits the throws and 
doesn’t turn it over, all while 
allowing Michigan’s stable of 
backs to shorten the game, he 
will have created the circum-
stances needed to pull off the 
upset.

And his mom may have some 

disgruntled customers Sunday 
morning.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Fifth-year senior quarterback John O’Korn needs to manage the game, not play the hero, for Michigan to have a chance to beat No. 2 Penn State on Saturday.

I need to pick 

it up, there’s no 

way around it.

You’ve got to 

keep them off 

the field.

Wolverines on brink 
of outright B1G title

The No. 3 Michigan field 

hockey team officially has a 
shot at an outright conference 
championship. With a weekend 
sweep, the Wolverines clinched at 
least a share of the regular season 
Big Ten championship, their first 
title since 2011. 

The championship is in its 

grasp because Michigan has been 
on fire as of late. Coming into the 
weekend, it boasted an undefeated 
Big Ten record and had allowed 
just two goals in its last eight 
games combined — all of which 
were victories.

This weekend, it added even 

more fuel to the fire.

Friday, the Wolverines (7-0 

Big Ten, 13-2 overall) easily 
dispatched Indiana (0-6, 6-10) 
in Bloomington, winning 2-0. 
Michigan continuously swarmed 
the Hoosiers’ attackers, creating 
turnovers and suffocating every 
offensive plan that Indiana tried to 
execute.

Michigan senior goalkeeper 

Sam Swenson’s most difficult 
challenge of the game was likely 
fighting off boredom, as the 
Wolverines didn’t surrender a 
single shot attempt to the Hoosiers.

“We’ve been defending with 

a whole lot of team speed and 
doubling down on the ball with our 
forwards,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We’ve been 
really diligent in continuing to play 
team defense.”

The victory against Indiana was 

the Wolverines’ eighth shutout 
in their last nine games — an 
unprecedented stretch that has led 
Michigan to within one shutout of 
its program record of 10.

After the relative ease of their 

Friday shutout, the Wolverines 
faced much more formidable 
opposition on Sunday afternoon, 
playing at then-No. 22 Iowa (1-5, 
5-10).

At the start of the match, both 

sides struggled to generate any 
offense — neither team had a single 
shot for the first 20 minutes of the 

match.

Then, 
the 
floodgates 
were 

opened.

Shortly after chalking up their 

first shot with roughly 10 minutes 
left in the half, the Wolverines took 
the lead when fifth-year senior 
midfielder Esther De Leijer rifled 
a shot into the right corner of the 
goal.

Just 
over 
a 
minute 
later, 

freshman midfielder Kayla Reed 
streaked down the right side of 
the field, dusting her defender and 
centering the ball to sophomore 
midfielder 
Fay 
Keijer. 
Keijer 

then deftly redirected the ball to 
junior forward Emma Way, who 
emphatically pounded it in the 
back of the cage for Michigan’s 
second goal.

And quickly after, sophomore 

forward Meg Dowthwaite spun 
past a defender and crushed the 
ball into the net — her fifth straight 
game with a goal.

“(Dowthwaite’s) 
skills 
are 

just outstanding,” Pankratz said. 
“She’s able to finish and make real 
polished world-class goals. It’s 
been fun to watch.”

And 
just 
like 
that, 
the 

Wolverines were up 3-0.

But they couldn’t rest easy.
Iowa’s 
sputtering 
offense 

roared to life in the second half, 
and suddenly, the Hawkeyes had 
scored two goals. With under four 
minutes remaining in the game, 
Iowa aggressively pushed all of 
its players forward for a penalty 
corner, desperately trying to knot 
the game at three.

Iowa forward Maddy Murphy 

received a pass, wound up her 
shot, and nailed the ball. She beat 
Swenson — but not the goalpost. 
Her shot glanced off the left post, 
and the Hawkeyes would fail to 
generate another chance.

Despite 
Iowa’s 
second-half 

goals, Pankratz was still full of 
praise after her team’s 3-2 victory.

“(The Hawkeyes) were taking a 

lot of risks, and that just changed 
the momentum of the game,” 
Pankratz said. “But I was really 
proud of our team for really 
holding on and getting the win.”

FIELD HOCKEY
Michigan recognizes weight of Penn State game

If 
the 
No. 
19 
Michigan 

football team hopes to make the 
Big Ten Championship — or go 
even further — it essentially has 
to win out the rest of the season. 

“You can lose one,” said 

senior left tackle Mason Cole, 
“but you can’t lose two.”

No two-loss team has ever 

made 
the 
College 
Football 

Playoff. And with one loss 
already on their record, the 
Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 5-1 
overall) face their biggest test 
yet this weekend on the road at 
No. 2 Penn State.

A loss removes them from the 

Playoff discussion, but a win 
keeps those hopes alive.

It’s Harbaugh’s third year at 

Michigan, and the team doesn’t 
want to settle for just another 
random bowl game in Florida.

Few analysts, fans or media 

outlets are giving Michigan 
much of a chance against the 
Nittany Lions.

The 
critics 
rip 
on 
the 

Wolverines’ struggling offense 
and, 
more 
specifically, 
the 

errant passing game.

“You try to zone it out, but 

you definitely hear (the critics),” 
said sophomore receiver Kekoa 
Crawford. “Personally, I like 
that. I like being the underdog, 
being doubted.”

The doubts kept pouring in 

after the Wolverines scraped 
past Indiana in overtime.

Michigan dropped two spots 

in the rankings and got lined up 
as an 11-point underdog on the 
same day. It was “one slap in the 
face after another,” as redshirt 
junior defensive end Chase 
Winovich described it.

“It’s pivotal for the season 

because (Penn State) won the 
Big Ten Championship last 
year, and they’re a great football 
team,” Winovich said.

The matchup carries far 

more weight than it did last 
year, 
when 
the 
Wolverines 

embarrassed the Nittany Lions 
in a 49-10 stomping in Ann 
Arbor.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

bottled up running back Saquon 
Barkley, holding him to just 
59 yards. The secondary shut 
down Penn State quarterback 
Trace McSorley, sacking him 
six times and allowing just 130 
yards in the air.

Michigan held Penn State to 

just 191 total offensive yards 
in 2016, but a lot has changed. 
Now, the Nittany Lions average 
456 yards per game.

“I was kind of surprised 

that (Penn State) really turned 
things around,” Winovich said. 
“During the game, I don’t think 
we had the highest regard for 
them. … I’m sure they were 
embarrassed in their own way. 
No one likes to lose by that 
much.”

Penn State was 2-2 at that 

point last year. It had already 
lost to Pittsburgh, and yet 
nobody 
would’ve 
predicted 

what happened next.

The Nittany Lions upset 

Ohio State and ran all the way 
to the Big Ten Championship. 
And after getting snubbed from 
the Playoff, they put on a show 

in a Rose Bowl classic against 
Southern California.

Barkley ran for 194 yards, 

and McSorley threw for 254.

It 
was 
that 
Rose 
Bowl 

performance that sparked an 
offseason 
filled 
with 
hype 

about the dynamic Barkley-
McSorley duo.

So far in 2017, the two have 

delivered.

Barkley averages 217 all-

purpose yards per game and 
has scored nine touchdowns. 
McSorley has thrown for over 
1,500 yards with 13 touchdown 
passes, and he has even run for 
four scores as well.

Penn State has all the talent 

it needs to continue winning 
in the Big Ten. Aside from 
Ohio State, it’s hard to imagine 
another Big Ten East team 
taking the Nittany Lions down.

Michigan believes it can be 

that team. It believes it can make 
the Big Ten Championship. And 
it believes there’s a spot for it in 
the College Football Playoff.

But if it loses again, there 

won’t be.

Michigan should see what it has in Peters

B

LOOMINGTON — For 
those who thought 
Michigan would avoid any 

more quarterback controversy 
this year, I’m sorry to be the 
bearer of 
bad news.

It may 

be time 
for Jim 
Harbaugh 
and the 
Wolverines 
to give 
redshirt 
freshman 
backup 
Brandon 
Peters a shot. They had a chance 
to do so in the second half against 
Indiana, and next week’s road 
game in a raucous environment 
against No. 3 Penn State may not 
be as good of an opportunity.

But, with how abysmal 

Michigan’s passing offense has 
been the past couple weeks, it still 
seems worth trying.

Michigan’s offensive woes 

looked to be solved after John 
O’Korn’s stellar performance 
on the road against Purdue. We 
haven’t seen that same player in 
the two games since.

It would be one thing if 

O’Korn fit the category of ‘game-
manager.’ That’s a term that often 
carries a negative connotation. 
But right now, a game manager 
under center wouldn’t be all that 
bad.

With how absurdly good 

the Wolverines are on defense, 
someone who could make the 
easy throws and reads while 
limiting turnovers would be a 
lifesaver. Couple that with an 
improving run game — Michigan 
rushed 44 times for 271 yards 
with two touchdowns Saturday — 
and you have a recipe for success.

But O’Korn hasn’t been a game 

manager. Quite simply, he has 
regressed since that big game 
against the Boilermakers.

In last week’s dreary, 

rain-soaked 14-10 loss to 
Michigan State, he threw 
three interceptions on three 

consecutive drives, killing 
any momentum Michigan had 
gained with an early second-half 
touchdown. That game could’ve 
easily been won. The turnovers 
made things harder.

O’Korn didn’t turn the ball 

over once against the Hoosiers on 
Saturday afternoon. But he still 
left precious points on the board 
after completing 10-of-20 passes 
for just 58 yards.

In the first quarter, he 

overthrew a wide-open Donovan 
Peoples-Jones on a sure 
touchdown. On the same drive, 
O’Korn left one a little too high 
for Grant Perry on 3rd-and-12, 
and Michigan settled for a field 
goal.

He may have made a bigger 

mistake in the third quarter on a 
play that developed beautifully.

After the Wolverines sold a run 

fake, redshirt sophomore tight 
end Zach Gentry ran an ‘over’ 
route, cutting across the field, and 
broke wide open.

The throw was there. Acres 

of wide-open turf — and a 
game-changing touchdown — 
beckoned.

But Gentry was left throwing 

his arms up in the air as he 
watched the ball fall harmlessly 
to the turf 20 yards away from 
him, the pass intended for a 
blanketed Kekoa Crawford.

Two drives later, O’Korn did 

look for Gentry. It came off play-
action once again. This time, 
though, Gentry wasn’t open. 
The ball was nearly picked off, 
and Michigan’s offense listlessly 
trudged off the field after yet 
another misfire.

Besides the missed throws, 

there were simple mistakes that 
one wouldn’t expect from a fifth-
year senior. Michigan took two 
delay of game penalties, including 
one that inexcusably negated a 
beautifully-designed shovel pass 
to Khalid Hill that would’ve kept 
the drive alive.

Conservatively, all those 

missed opportunities cost the 
Wolverines 11 points — points 
that would’ve been a buffer 
against Indiana’s late push to 
force overtime. No. 3 Penn State 
isn’t as likely to be so forgiving of 
such errors.

O’Korn was defensive when 

asked what he thought it would 
take to fix the passing game.

“We ran for over 200 yards,” 

O’Korn said. “That was what was 
working. I don’t know that we 
need to necessarily fix anything. 
We went with what was working, 
and we won the game.”

Harbaugh, meanwhile, took a 

‘wait-and-see’ approach with his 
assessment of O’Korn after the 
game.

“Well, we have to really 

look at the tape before I go into 
that,” he said. “ … We had some 
opportunities. Not a lot — we 
were grinding some meat out 
there today.

“There wasn’t a plan to throw 

25 times, 30 times or 20 times. 

Had some opportunities. Made 
some plays. … Overthrew an open 
go route to Donovan (Peoples-
Jones). Got to look at it before I 
say anything.”

But with a passing game that 

has averaged just 4.65 yards per 
attempt the past two weeks, meat 
grinding can only take a team 
so far — especially with games 
against the Nittany Lions, No. 7 
Wisconsin and No. 9 Ohio State 
remaining on the schedule.

So here we are, yet again, 

embroiled in another debate over 
the quarterback situation.

After today, though, the 

answer seems clear: at this point, 
Michigan should see what it has 
with its backup quarterback.

It knows what it has from its 

starter. And if Saturday was it, 
there’s no sense in not checking 
what else is there.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Fifth-year senior quarterback John O’Korn has averaged just 4.65 yards per attempt in two starts, making Brandon Peters worthy of consideration.

It’s not easy to stop a Heisman-

candidate running back, and it’s 
a lot harder to do so on the road 
during one of college football’s 
most 
recognizable 
traditions 

— the whiteout game in Happy 
Valley.

But that’s the task the No. 19 

Michigan football team (2-1 Big 
Ten, 5-1 overall) is faced with 
this week as it prepares for No. 
2 Penn State (3-0 Big Ten, 6-0 
overall) and Saquon Barkley.

Barkley is third in the Big 

Ten for total scoring with two 
receiving 
touchdowns, 
six 

rushing touchdowns, one kick 
return touchdown and even a 
passing touchdown.

He averages 108 rushing yards 

per game and 6.4 yards per carry.

Keeping 
Barkley’s 

contributions to a minimum will 
be tough to say the least, even for 
Michigan, which leads the nation 
in total defense.

“It’ll 
be 
a 
team 
effort 

defensively to go against a great 
player, and a really outstanding 
offense,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh.

“… (Barkley) can catch the 

ball out of the backfield. He can 
run all of the assortment of runs, 
inside the tackles and on the 
edge. Very good pass protector. 
He is a multi-purpose back that 
can do everything well.”

Barkley’s presence pits an elite 

offense against an elite defense. 
The Wolverines’ two starting 
linebackers, senior Mike McCray 
and sophomore Devin Bush Jr., 
will have a lot on their hands.

“I’m going to be matched up 

on him all game,” Bush said. “I’m 
going to have to stop him in the 
run game and the pass game, so I 
know he’s going to test me.”

Linebackers played a big role 

in shutting down the Nittany 
Lions last year, when Michigan 
steamrolled Penn State, 49-10. 
Former linebacker Ben Gedeon 
racked up 11 tackles, and VIPER 
Jabrill Peppers had five tackles 
and a quarterback hurry.

But Barkley has only gotten 

better, and sophomore Khaleke 
Hudson is the new VIPER. Him, 
McCray and Bush have to ensure 
that Barkley doesn’t break loose 
for big gains.

“That’s something we pride 

ourselves on,” Bush said. “You 
know, they’re going to get those 
three- or five-yard (runs), but 
as long as they’re not breaking 
20-yard runs consistently, we’re 
going to be fine.”

Michigan’s defense has shut 

down opponents’ running backs 
so far. It has allowed just 2.64 
yard per carry and has given up 
only three rushing touchdowns.

The Wolverines should also 

take notes out of some fellow Big 
Ten teams’ playbooks. 

Two weeks ago, Northwestern 

completely eliminated Barkley 
from the game in the first half 
despite ultimately losing, 31-7.

For the first 30 minutes in 

Evanston, Barkley ran just eight 
times for negative one yards. 
The Wildcats filled the gaps and 
packed the line of scrimmage 
to contain Barkley, but Penn 
State was able to spread the ball 
through its quarterback Trace 
McSorley and found ways to 
score through other components.

Northwestern 
couldn’t 

contain Barkley all game though, 
and he ended up scoring a 
53-yard touchdown run.

Another opponent, Indiana, 

held Barkley to just 56 rushing 
yards.

“When you play an offense like 

(Penn State), you have to try and 
eliminate those explosive plays,” 
said fifth-year senior defensive 
tackle Maurice Hurst. “You 
have to shut down two really 
dynamic players in McSorley and 
(Barkley).

“(Barkley) just seems to get 

better every single year. We 
identified him as someone who 
was a really good player even as 
a freshman. Someone that we 
thought would be a top-10 pick 
one day.”

He is well on his way to the 

high ranks of the NFL Draft, and 
if Michigan wants to pull off the 
upset, stopping him is the first 
step.

Stopping 
Barkley: 
Michigan’s 
biggest test

TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The good, the bad and the ugly: Indiana

If you listen closely, you can 

hear the Wolverine faithful 
breathing a collective sigh of 
relief.

Just a week after a bruising 

loss to now-No. 18 Michigan 
State pushed the Michigan 
football team’s College Football 
Playoff aspirations to the brink 
of extinction, the 19th-ranked 
Wolverines 
almost 
suffered 

the fatal blow Saturday in 
Bloomington. With a 46-yard 
field goal as time expired, 
Indiana forced Michigan to 
win the game in overtime.

Thanks 
to 
a 
25-yard 

touchdown rush from junior 
running back Karan Higdon 
and a goal-line stand from their 
defense, the Wolverines finally 
did — preserving their season 
in the process.

The Daily breaks down the 

good, the bad and the ugly from 
Saturday’s game:

The good
Though it may be hard to 

see at first glance, Higdon’s 
200-yard, 
three-touchdown 

performance wasn’t the only 
bright spot in Michigan’s 27-20 
win.

As last week’s catastrophic 

five-turnover 
outing 

illustrated, the importance of 
winning the turnover battle 
can’t 
be 
overstated. 
The 

Wolverines got back on track 
against the Hoosiers, posting 
a pivotal zero in the turnover 
column while also forcing two 
interceptions — the latter of 
which came from junior safety 
Tyree Kinnel on the final play 
of the game.

Saturday, every possession 

mattered. 

Last 
week 
also 
taught 

Michigan that halftime deficits 
aren’t easy to overcome, as the 

Spartans led 14-3 at the break 
and the Wolverines scored just 
seven points after it. Against 
Indiana — for the first time 
since a Sept. 9 matchup against 
a lowly Cincinnati team —
Michigan entered the locker 
room with a lead larger than 
three points.

Though the Hoosiers cut 

into that lead on multiple 
occasions in the second half, 
the Wolverines learned the 
value of a safety cushion.

They 
also 
learned 
how 

to 
contain 
a 
dual-threat 

quarterback. After Michigan 
State 
quarterback 
Brian 

Lewerke 
completed 
11-of-

22 passes for 94 yards and 
a 
touchdown 
and 
tallied 

15 carries for 64 yards and 
a 
touchdown, 
Michigan’s 

defense wouldn’t let Indiana 
quarterback Peyton Ramsey do 
the same.

The 
Wolverines 
harassed 

Ramsey all game, totaling three 
sacks for 20 yards and four 
quarterback hits along with the 
two picks. While he still threw 
for 178 yards and a touchdown, 
he found no success on the 
ground, carrying the ball 14 
times for a total of 14 yards.

The bad
While the running game 

centered on Higdon had its best 
performance of the season, the 
same could not be said of fifth-
year senior John O’Korn and 
Michigan’s passing game.

Last week, O’Korn received 

somewhat of a pass for his 
three-interception night due to 
the torrential downpour that 
engulfed Michigan Stadium. 
His 10-for-20, 58-yard day 
against the Hoosiers can’t be 
excused.

After 
the 
game, 
when 

asked about the Wolverines’ 
struggles in the air, O’Korn 
pivoted, explaining that they 

stuck to the running game 
because it was working. Some 
of his teammates also stated 
that the ground game was the 
point of emphasis on offense.

The truth of the matter is 

that both offensive units can 
work 
simultaneously. 
But 

Saturday, only one did.

Michigan’s lack of success in 

the air hurt it toward the end 
of the game, as the Hoosiers 
launched 
their 
10-point 

comeback in the fourth quarter. 
After Higdon gave his team a 
10-point lead with 10 minutes left 
and then again after sophomore 
corner Lavert Hill intercepted 
Ramsey with six minutes to go, 
the Wolverines should have been 
able to ice the game.

Instead, Indiana saw the 

runs coming and managed to 
stop them, forcing a three-and-
out on each series to lead up 
to their touchdown drive, and 
later, their last-second field 
goal.

The ugly
Sixteen. That is the program-

record number of penalties the 
Wolverines committed against 
the Hoosiers on Saturday.

Those 
penalties, 
which 

were 
spread 
widely 
across 

the 
offense, 
defense 
and 

special teams units, totaled a 
whopping 141 yards lost. For 
perspective, that is nearly two 
and a half times the number of 
passing yards O’Korn had.

On top of those high figures, 

the timing of the penalties 
couldn’t have been much worse 
for Michigan.

You 
would 
need 
both 

hands to count the number 
of penalties that could have 
proven disastrous, including 
a pass interference penalty 
on Indiana’s first overtime 
possession that moved the 
Hoosiers to the 12-yard line. 
It took a stellar goal-line stand 
from the Wolverines’ defense 
to prevent Indiana from tying 
the game.

With so much momentum 

on the Hoosiers’ side, if the 
game went to double overtime, 
Michigan might not have come 
out on top.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was quick to point out that the Wolverines’ program-high 16 penalties against Indiana need to be corrected moving forward.

Hill highlights strong showing from secondary

BLOOMINGTON 
— 
As 

Lavert Hill sat in the bowels 
of 
Memorial 
Stadium, 
he 

was asked if his brother had 
texted him. The sophomore 
cornerback admitted he hadn’t 
checked his phone yet, but it’s 
easy to understand why a detail 
like that could peak curiosity.

It was just two years ago, 

after all, that Michigan found 
itself in a double-overtime 
game in Bloomington — one not 
too different from the overtime 
thriller of Saturday afternoon. 
That one came down to the 
final play too.

Then-Hoosier 
quarterback 

Nate Sudfeld lined up in the 
shotgun from the two-yard 
line, and looked right. Mitchell 
Paige ran a curl route and 
Sudfeld took aim. The ball 
was in Paige’s hands, and the 
Wolverines’ season was about 
to 
be 
rendered 
irrelevant. 

Then-junior safety Delano Hill 
— Lavert’s older brother — had 
other plans, ripping the ball 
from Paige’s grasp.

Saturday 
afternoon’s 

conclusion 
wasn’t 
quite 
as 

dramatic, 
nor 
convenient. 

Indiana 
had 
a 
chance 
to 

ruin 
Michigan’s 
season 
in 

Bloomington once again, but 
this time, the final pass never 
reached a receiver’s hands. The 
younger Hill didn’t replicate 
Delano’s 
game-ending 
play. 

Junior safety Tyree Kinnel did.

“I (remember) watching that 

play a couple years ago, it was 
pretty exciting,” Hill said. “I 
thought about that during this 
game. I just wanted to go out 
there and ball out.”

That is exactly what Hill 

did, even if he wasn’t the one to 
capture the final highlight.

And if he had checked his 

phone after the game, there’s 
a chance he would have seen 
a tweet from Jourdan Lewis 
calling him an All-American.

He may not be there yet, but 

Saturday made it look like he is 
well on his way.

“He’s been pretty high all 

season, he really has,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Lavert’s been a really good 
player for us. (I) was gonna 
say steady, but he’s been better 
than steady. He’s been playing 
at a really high level — had 
some 
great 

defenses 
on 

balls, 
pass 

break 
ups, 

interception, 
tight coverage.

“That’s why 

we 
brought 

him here.”

Hill put his 

stamp on the 
game 
from 

the get-go. On 
Indiana’s second drive of the 
game. Ramsey dropped back 
to pass, only to watch Hill pick 
him off near the Hoosiers’ own 
25-yard line. A questionable 
pass interference call brought 
the play back, but Hill would 
still have his moment.

On 2nd-and-2 in the fourth 

quarter, Indiana quarterback 
Peyton 
Ramsey 
targeted 

wide receiver Taysir Mack 
on the sideline. In doing so, 
he targeted Hill too. It was a 
decision he’d soon regret.

Hill boxed out Mack — 

forcing him toward the hash 
marks — all while shadowing 
him on the inside, eventually 

contorting 
his 

body and high-
pointing the ball 
to come down to 
the turf with an 
interception.

Theoretically, 

Hill’s 
pick 

should have put 
the game to bed.

It 
came 

with just over 
six 
minutes 

remaining in the game and 
the Wolverines held a 10-point 
lead.

Instead, despite having only 

one 
timeout, 
the 
Hoosiers 

managed to push the game to 
overtime with a field goal that 
went through the uprights as 
the clock expired.

Hill’s counterpart in the 

secondary 
eventually 
gave 

Michigan its victory.

Ramsey 
rolled 
to 
his 

left, carrying with him the 
Hoosiers’ final hopes of keeping 
the chance of an upset alive in 
Bloomington. He retreated to 
the 15-yard line with defensive 
end Chase Winovich collapsing 
on him fast.

And just as he absorbed 

the hit, he floated the ball 
into the end zone, albeit to 
no one in particular. Kinnel 
took full advantage, rising up 
uncontested to nab the ball out 
of the air and simultaneously 
put the Wolverines on the right 
side of their second consecutive 
upset scare.

What you may have missed, 

however, is what made it so 
easy for Kinnel to pick the 
ball off. There was only one 
receiver that Ramsey could 
have been targeting on the 
play — Indiana’s top wideout, 
Simmie Cobbs Jr. But he was 
taken out of the play.

Lavert Hill was the one 

guarding him.

Higdon leads ‘M’ in OT

BLOOMINGTON — Junior 

running back Karan Higdon sat 
in the press conference room 
with a wide smile across his face.

Deep below the stands of 

Indiana’s 
Memorial 
Stadium, 

Higdon 
had 
just 
finished 

answering questions, and as he 
got up to leave, he passed by his 
coach, Jim Harbaugh.

The two bumped fists.
“Good job,” Harbaugh told him.
It’s easy to see why. In No. 17 

Michigan’s 27-20 overtime win, 
Higdon put the team on his back, 
running for three touchdowns 
and 200 yards on 25 carries.

He became the first Michigan 

player to rush for at least 200 
yards since Devin Gardner in 
2012, and he became the first 
running back to do so since Mike 
Hart in 2007.

Higdon’s 
final 
touchdown 

was the difference maker, as 
the Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 
5-1 overall) recovered from last 
week’s loss to Michigan State.

On the first play of overtime, 

the coaches called for Higdon 
to run up the gut, but once he 
got the ball, the offensive line 
was stuffed. He ran into his own 
teammate, but bounced left for a 
footrace to the end zone.

He sped past the Hoosiers’ 

defense and carried the ball 25 
yards for a touchdown.

The play mirrored his first 

touchdown in the second quarter, 
when he also had to adjust on the 
fly and skip out wide for the score.

In fact, it was the same play.
“We called that play earlier, 

and I broke out for a nice little 
touchdown run,” Higdon said. 
“So we felt good going back to it. 
I got the ball, saw the hole was 
clogged and decided to make 
something happen. So I bounced 
it, saw the defense overpursued 
and it was off to the races.”

Added Harbaugh: “He was 

phenomenal. I don’t know how 
many yards he got after contact, 

but those were tough yards. It 
looked like there’d be a tackle for 
loss, a small gain or no gain, and 
he found a way to get four or five 
yards out of it.”

Running 
Higdon 
up 
the 

middle had worked well all game. 
He averaged eight yards per 
carry, and the offensive line was 
blocking for him and the other 
running backs better than they 
had all season.

Oddly enough, two of his three 

touchdowns came on plays where 
the blocking didn’t pan out.

His longest rush, though — a 

59-yard touchdown — arrived in 
the fourth quarter.

The Wolverines led by just six 

points, and they were starting a 
drive from their own 16-yard line. 
After handing the ball to Higdon 
three straight times, the coaches 
subbed him out for one play.

When he came back on to the 

field, though, they called his 
number again. This time, all of 
the blocks arrived, and Higdon 
found a hole.

He followed his blocker, burst 

through the gap, and streaked to 
the end zone.

“We went with the run game 

a little more today,” Higdon said. 
“… We had a salty taste in our 
mouth from last week, and we 
just stuck to the game plan and 
trusted it. All of the guys did their 
job.”

While Michigan’s pass offense 

struggled against the Hoosiers 
— totaling just 59 yards all game 
— the game plan this week had 
been to run. The passing game 
had also proven to be a problem 
against Michigan State, and 
Higdon’s physical run game was 
seen as the solution.

“It was going to be more run 

heavy,” Harbaugh said. “We 
thought we could move the ball 
and be successful.

“We wanted to play that 

kind of a ball game. We ran the 
isolation, we ran the power, we 
ran the counters. … It was just 
part of the plan.”

The plan worked.

Five Things We Learned: Higdon a weapon, penalties a problem

Those 
who 
hoped 
that 

the Michigan football team 
would follow up an upset 
loss to Michigan State with a 
no-doubter 
against 
Indiana 

were left sorely disappointed 
Saturday.

The Hoosiers pushed the 

19th-ranked 
Wolverines 
to 

overtime with a field goal in the 
final two seconds of regulation 
before Michigan sealed a 27-20 
victory 
with 
a 
touchdown 

rush from junior running back 
Karan Higdon and a goal line 
stand that was capped off by 
junior safety Tyree Kinnel’s 
game-ending interception.

Next up for Michigan is a 

date with No. 2 Penn State in 
State College — a contest that 
has earned ESPN’s “College 
GameDay” treatment.

Before the Wolverines get 

there, though, here are five things 
we learned in Bloomington.

1. Hill can be a shutdown 

corner

If it wasn’t clear enough 

already, losing Jourdan Lewis 
may not be so detrimental after 
all.

Sophomore 
cornerback 

Lavert Hill has looked like 
a shutdown corner through 
Michigan’s first six games, and 
if you don’t want to take our 
word for it, then his numbers 
can speak for themselves.

According to Pro Football 

Focus, Hill has been targeted 
21 times this season. On those 
targets, opposing quarterbacks 
have a 18.8 quarterback rating, 
while receivers have managed 
just eight catches with zero 
touchdowns. On top of that, 
Hill has recorded six pass 
breakups and two interceptions 
— the latest of which came 
against Indiana.

With just over six minutes 

remaining 
in 
the 
fourth 

quarter, Hill covered Taysir 
Mack perfectly before making 
an impressive play on the 

ball to pick off quarterback 
Peyton Ramsey. If not for 
an 
uninspiring 
offensive 

effort to kill the clock, Hill’s 
interception could have iced 
the game.

Hill had another pick on the 

Hoosiers’ second drive of the 
game, but it was called back on a 
questionable pass interference 
call.

The Wolverines now rank as 

the third-best passing defense 
in the nation, allowing 138 
yards per game through the air. 
Hill has played no small part in 
that.

2. Running the ball, with 

Higdon, is Michigan’s best 
weapon on offense

It took five years, but a 

Wolverine finally rushed for 
200 yards again.

Denard Robinson did so in in 

2012, and on Saturday, junior 
running back Karan Higdon hit 
exactly 200 rushing yards on 
the Wolverines’ final offensive 
play of the game — a 25-yard 
touchdown dash in overtime.

Higdon 
earned 
the 
start 

over fifth-year senior Ty Isaac 
and sophomore Chris Evans, 
and averaged eight yards per 
carry. A handful of Wolverines 
mentioned 
last 
week 
that 

reestablishing the run game 
would be crucial to Michigan’s 
success, and it turned out they 
were right. And Higdon was the 
reason why.

Harbaugh 
complimented 

Higdon after the game for 
his ability to gain yards after 
contact. A handful of times 
against 
Indiana, 
Michigan’s 

offensive line failed to get the 
right blocks in place, making it 
difficult for Higdon to find the 
designed gaps.

Nonetheless, 
he 
created 

positive 
yards 
by 
breaking 

tackles and finding open space.

He leads the Wolverines with 

five rushing touchdowns this 
season, and as the passing game 
continues to struggle, it’s likely 
that the Wolverines will have to 
rely on their running backs to 
carry the weight against Penn 
State.

Higdon’s physical run game 

seems to be the best option.

3. 
Peoples-Jones 
is 
far 

more than a punt returner

The bad news for Michigan 

fans is that the Wolverines 
mustered just 58 yards through 
the air. The good news is that 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
is 

coming into his own in the 
receiving game.

The freshman led Michigan 

with 
four 
receptions 
and 

accounted 
for 
34 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ passing yards — 
including an impressive over-
the-head catch on 3rd-and-7 
for a 17-yard gain in the second 
quarter.

That’s without mentioning 

that 
Peoples-Jones 
should 

have had a 60-yard touchdown 
reception.

In 
the 
first 
quarter, 
on 

1st-and-10 
from 
Michigan’s 

own 40-yard line, Peoples-
Jones 
streaked 
through 

Indiana’s secondary and beat 
his coverage in a foot race on a 
go route, only to watch as fifth-
year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn overthrew him.

Still, after a shaky start to the 

year serving as the Wolverines’ 
punt returner, Peoples-Jones 
has shown he has all the tools 
to become a viable receiving 
threat in the wake of fellow 
freshman Tarik Black’s injury.

4. Penalties are a problem 

on both sides of the ball

“I tell my six-year-old not to 

spill the milk, and gosh darnit, 
the next thing you know, he’s 
spilled the milk.”

That’s 
the 
metaphor 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
used in comparison to the 
program-record 16 penalties 
the Wolverines committed.

Just as he tells his son not 

spill milk, he tells the team 
not to commit penalties. But 
penalties happen anyway.

Michigan’s offense caused 

four of them and the special 
teams units had three flags 
thrown against them on returns.

On one play in the second 

quarter, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense was flagged three times 
on a single play. Sophomore 

defensive back Khaleke Hudson 
was called offsides, and redshirt 
junior defensive back Brandon 
Watson held his receiver.

Then fifth-year senior tackle 

Maurice Hurst rammed into 
Indiana’s quarterback late and 
was flagged for roughing the 
passer.

It’s not often that you see 

three flags on one play, but 
Michigan made it happen. It 
still came away with the win 
in Bloomington, but staying 
disciplined will be far more 
important against the three 
top-six teams remaining on 
Michigan’s schedule.

5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

Peters gets snaps against 
Penn State

It wasn’t too long ago that 

the Michigan faithful were 
calling for O’Korn to replace 
redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight under center.

As it turns out, the grass isn’t 

always greener on the other 
side.

O’Korn 
has 
started 
two 

games 
since 
replacing 
an 

injured 
Speight 
against 

Purdue and throwing for 270 
yards and a touchdown. Since 
then, the results haven’t been 
encouraging.

With Speight still suffering 

from three fractured vertebrae, 
the Wolverines have averaged 
just 4.65 yards per attempt in 
the passing game. In the last 
two weeks, O’Korn has posted 
just 256 yards with a 47.3 
percent completion rate and 
three interceptions.

For 
redshirt 
freshman 

Brandon Peters to see time 
as 
Michigan’s 
quarterback 

in 
State 
College, 
O’Korn’s 

struggles will need to persist. 
It’s hard to imagine Harbaugh 
thrusting Peters into the fire 
midway through the game, but 
a catastrophe wouldn’t rule 
anything out.

One thing is certain: O’Korn 

has 
played 
himself 
into 
a 

situation where the Wolverines 
need to at least entertain the 
thought of Peters.

Soundtracking: House hunting

*Three weeks ago*
L

ying in my dorm room on a Tuesday night, I 
look around at my walls that are covered in 
the same posters and the same modular dorm 

furniture from my time in South Quad Residence Hall 
last year. Two years in the dorms keeps things simple.

My phone vibrates. A new group chat with two 

friends I met in my hall last year. One message.

“What are you guys doing for housing next year?”
Shit.
I Ain’t Got Time! — Tyler, The Creator
I’ve been to my upperclassmen friends’ 

houses and house parties but I always 
assumed houses just fell into your lap. Last 
year I didn’t have to do anything. Housing 
sent me an email, I picked my room and my 
housing was guaranteed for another year. I 
was guaranteed meals every day, a bathroom 
and a wall to hang my Garfield cross-stitch 
on. The simple bare necessities.

Now I’m lost. I haven’t thought about next 

year yet. We just got back from break in 
September and now the universe expects me 
to pull an apartment out of thin air and lease 
that bad boy for junior year. Fate is a cruel 
mistress.

I run to my laptop and open a new window. 

Google search: How do you rent houses in 
Ann Arbor?

Down the rabbit hole.
Shop Around — The Miracles
What seems like a million sites for 

apartment and house rentals near campus 
flood my screen. Clicking randomly, I open about 
10 of them and start the hunt.

Filters: 3 bed, 1.5 bath, Ann Arbor, For Rent, 

House or Apartment, Heat Included, Washer/
Dryer, Parking Available.

All options upwards of $900 per person per 

month.

I’m a broke college kid. I take other people’s 

leftovers if they’re going to let the wait staff take 
their plate. I pick up change I find on the ground. 
My shoes are so ripped they might as well be flip 
flops. I can’t pay rent like that every month. 

I cap the search to a certain amount of rent per 

month. Suddenly, my plentiful options disappear. 
I am left with six or seven pins on a map far from 
Central Campus. Looks like I’m buying a bike too, 
because off-campus might as well be Ypsi for my 
price range.

No Money (Jetski) — Joe Hertler & the Rainbow 

Seekers

However, options are options and I have a few places 

to check out that I can afford. Why does this sound like 
a “House Hunters”-type reality show where the host 
cheesily talks to the camera and a price counter sits on 
the bottom right hand corner of the screen?

*One week later*
I’m standing outside a lovely red house waiting for a 

landlord to give me and my roommates a tour. There’s 

a big front porch but it’s currently blocked by the 
remnants of a beer pong table that has definitely 
seen better days. Bikes are locked up around the 
perimeter.

The landlord pulls up and hops out of his car with 

a huge smile on his face. Yellow legal pad in hand, 
he’s ready to make a deal while I’m ready to piss my 
pants at the thought of taking this next step toward 
adulthood.

Judging from the front, the house looks amazing. 

It gives me a very cozy feeling. As the landlord, my 
roommates and I walk up the steps, pine needles 
stick to the soles of my shoes. I have to kick them 
off before reaching the door. I’m ready to officially 
fall in love with this place, agree to sign a lease on 
the spot and be done with this hellhole that is the 
housing search. I’ve looked at too many listings and 
Google Docs and pro / con lists for a small child in 

a 19-year-old college student’s body.

We step inside and my eyes dart all around.
Impressions — John Coltrane
The interior does not match the homey vibe I got 

from outside. Flooring is coming up; a leaky faucet 
won’t stop echoing in my ear and some parts of the 
ceiling are barely high enough for a 5-foot-8-inch 
dude like myself to fit under.

Every question we ask is another bullet point in 

the con list of this entry in our “JUNIOR YEAR 

HOUSING LET’S GET IT” Google Doc. 
Is it furnished? Nope. Do you pay for heat 
and water? No way. Is it the same price as 
we saw online? No dice. I feel like I’m on 
“Punk’d” with post-“That 70s Show” but 
pre-”No Strings Attached” Ashton Kutcher.

As we leave the tour, the landlord shakes 

my hand and says he felt like we really 
enjoyed the place. He says he’ll give us a call 
in a few days to check in and see if we want 
to schedule a lease signing date.

Don’t Bother Calling — Moses Sumney
*One week even later*
No such luck in trying to put a roof over 

my head next year. Options keep getting 
crossed off our Google Doc. Pins on our 
homemade 
map 
disappear 
everyday. 

Promising listings turn into disappointing 
tours. My friends around me slowly sign 
their leases and leave my roommates and I 
floundering.

It’s not even midterms yet and I’m already 

stressed beyond belief. Way to go, Mr. XO 

Dorm Llif3 by Lil Roomie Vert. 

I Do Need Saving — Frontier Ruckus
The only thing saving me from resolving to live 

in the Shapiro Undergraduate Library’s basement 
for the entirety of my junior year is knowing my 
roommates are just as stressed as me. Strength in 
numbers.

We schedule an apartment tour, expecting 

another rough display of an even rougher apartment 
complex that’s 20 miles away and has about 14 cats 
as current tenants. To our surprise, the place is 
beautiful inside and out. Large unit, two toilets, a 
dishwasher (which I have never had in my life so 
this is a new adventure for me) and the price warms 
my heart.

*Today*
Even if the entire process almost drove me mad, 

we’re home now.

W

hen 
I 
think 

about 
it 

too 
much, 
I 

wonder why I even go into 
all the effort of zapping 
water with waves of energy 
just to soak some leaves in 
it so it turns a slight shade 
that water is not supposed 
to be, for me to then sweeten 
it with copious amounts of 
honey that will only make 
my sedentary body softer.

I started drinking tea in 

high school. I’m not really 
sure why. Probably because 
tea is easier to make than 
coffee. Operating a coffee 
maker required a level of 
commitment 
I 
was 
not 

ready for. Microwaves are 
easy.

I’ve only ever made tea 

using a microwave and 
with every new microwave 
I have to learn exactly how 
long it’ll take to get the 
water just right. At home, 
put it in for 1 minute and 
45 seconds every time. At 
school, it’s 1 minute and 
30 seconds if I’m using a 
small mug and 2 minutes if 
I’m feeling patient enough 
to let it cool before I burn 
my tongue. I’m a brunette 
Goldilocks with a different 
preference of bland food.

—
I 
could 
look 
at 
one 

thousand 
pictures 
and 

never 
recall 
the 
same 

feelings as when I inhale 
the steam from a mug of 
tea and the first sip touches 
my tongue. The smell, the 
taste, the burning I can 
trace down my esophagus 
sends my mind reeling back 
in time.

—
I don’t know how to spell 

chamomille but I know 
how it smells and the smell 
makes me think of my mom.

Last semester it took 

three weeks before I was 
diagnosed with mono and 
I learned that a phone call 

is not the same as a hug. 
Six-hundred 
miles 
later, 

my mom was in Ann Arbor 
and not leaving until I was 
better. We carried bags 
of saltines and soup into 
a house we rented in a 
neighborhood by the train 
tracks. The living room had 
one lamp, lace curtains and 
everything was a shade of 
off-white.

I cried because I was 

20 years old and with my 
mother who had done the 
nicest thing anyone had 
ever done for me. Her hands 
held me, and my hands held 
mugs of tea. The tea made 
me better then, but now 
it makes me uneasy. If I 
can’t take care of myself 
when I’m sick, will I ever 
feel independent? I tell 
myself to swallow the tea 
and remember that there is 
strength in needing others.

—
Green 
tea 
has 
the 

aftertaste of the wet soil 
where my sister and I hiked.

If a tree falls in the 

middle of the woods and 
nobody’s there to hear it, it 
still makes a sound. I know 
because no one was there 
to hear us but our words 
shook the leaves.

It was humid and we 

were 
both 
carrying 
40 

pounds on our backs and we 
hadn’t spent so much time 
together since Christmas.

Now when I drink green 

tea, I think about how 
much I miss you. I want to 
be home and running into 
your room to jump on your 
bed. I want to plan our next 
trip and vow that no matter 
how tired we get we will 
not get tired of each other. I 
want to be back on that trail 
and take back the words I 
said. But once a tree falls, 
it is too heavy to be lifted 
back up.

I drink green tea and 

think about how all we 
could do was keep walking 
and 
I 
remember 
that 

sometimes the best way out 
is through.

—

I hear the radio when I 

drink English breakfast tea.

Some mornings it was 

NPR, some mornings it 
was the local show talking 
about celebrity gossip that 
no one wanted to hear at 7 
a.m. My mug is a stress ball 
I squeeze between my legs 
as I sit in traffic. I balance a 
cup of yogurt on top of the 
steering wheel that I won’t 

have time to finish before 
the bell rings.

My mug has ridges on 

the handle. I used to know 
exactly how many ridges 
there were. My fingers 
traced them up and down, 
counting 1, 2, 3… my eyes 
flick up and around the 
room but I don’t want 
to make eye contact so I 
continue to raise the mugs 
to my lips even though 
there is no tea left.

Eventually high school 

ends. Now I have a different 
travel mug with smooth 
sides. With no ridges to 
count, I open and close the 
lid: open, close, open, close, 

open, close.

—
Christmas has a smell 

that is Trader Joe’s Candy 
Cane Lane tea. At home, 
the box of tea is still on the 
same shelf in the pantry 
but I can’t find my favorite 
mug.

I lay on my bed as my 

family moves around the 
house. I haven’t been home 
all semester and suddenly I 
feel like a boulder dropped 
into a river, with the water 
continuing to rush around 
me. I’m not sure if home is 
home anymore and I can’t 
fall asleep.

The tea still tastes the 

same. Sometimes you have 
to look for what stays 
constant in all the change.

—
A bit behind on the food 

trend scene, I recently got 
into Chai. The combination 
of spices make me feel 
a color deeper than the 
orange of fall leaves, and I 
love the feeling of fullness 
the milk leaves in my 
stomach.

I am not sure what Chai 

will teach me. I am not 
sure what memories will 
flood my mind when I 
smell cinnamon or ginger 
or cloves. Maybe I will 
remember how it felt to be 
20 — knowing who I am 
and who I want to be, but 
not really knowing how 
to reconcile those. I might 
remember my purple pen 
and journal that I took 
out at every coffee shop as 
I procrastinated writing 
papers that would actually 
get me a grade. I hope the 
taste reminds me of what it 
felt like to be able to change 
my mind, make mistakes, 
be forgiven and pour myself 
into my passions.

In the end, I am thankful 

I take a couple minutes out 
of every day to heat some 
water.

Navigating campus culture as an 

international student

b y I s h i M o r i, Daily Staff Reporter

A

s a Japanese citizen who grew 
up in New Jersey, I know many 
Asian expatriates who never quite 
felt comfortable living here.

Northern New Jersey is an area with a large 

Korean immigrant population. Many of my 
childhood friends attended Korean churches 
and associated with Korean cliques in middle 
school. I was once a part of this clique, along 
with a Nepalese friend. A Korean family friend 
also told me Korean adults in my area never 
really needed to master English because of 
how cohesive their community was.

Another childhood friend of mine from my 

middle and high schools — who is originally 
from Tokyo — once told me he was embar-
rassed by his lackluster English and seldom 
spoke to Americans, instead opting to associate 
with the children of other Japanese expatri-
ates.

I have always felt torn about my two iden-

tities as a Japanese and an American. From a 
very young age, I felt as if I needed to prove to 
others that I was American enough, and did 
so by seldom talking about my heritage; on the 
other hand, I vociferously studied Japanese so 
my expat friends’ parents welcomed me as one 
of their own and not “one of those Japanese 
Americans.”

My friends from both sides of the Pacific 

have simultaneously labeled me as “the most 
Americanized Asian I know” and “the most 
Japanized American I know.” I have a friend 
who hails from a town in Connecticut with a 
98-percent white population and Japanese 
friends who left the United States never quite 
understanding why I wanted to stay in this 
“rubbish” of a country, where busses never 
come on time and police were patronizing 
toward their non-English speaking parents.

But then again, I was repeatedly frustrated 

by divisions I saw growing up based on nation-
ality. I repeated tried to persuade my friend 
from Tokyo to interact with Americans; but I 
also saw my American friends treating immi-
grant communities as something mysterious 
and incomprehensible.

When I came to campus my freshman year, 

I expected to see less ethnic clustering. My 
hometown was 35 percent Asian; the Univer-
sity of Michigan was 15 percent, and I assumed 
in-state Asian Americans were thoroughly 
integrated into mainstream American soci-
ety simply because I didn’t realize there was 
a sizeable Asian population in the Midwest. 
Surely there would be more mixing of cultures, 
I thought.

But I forgot to account for the more than 

6,000 international students who study in Ann 
Arbor. And I saw the same phenomenon again, 
where expatriates were not able to blend into 
mainstream society and Americans themselves 
were not interested in approaching them.

From several conversations with Asian 

international students, I’ve gained insight into 
some of the cultural barriers that prevent them 
from stepping outside their comfort zones.

******
In 1854, Yung Wing became the first Chinese 

student to graduate from a North American 
university after receiving a diploma from Yale. 
In 1872, the University of Michigan admitted 
its first Japanese student. Two decades later, 
Mary Stone and Ida Khan, who would eventu-
ally become pioneers of Western medicine in 
China, came to Ann Arbor from China to pur-
sue medical degrees.

Fueled by a growing middle class across the 

Pacific, international student enrollment in 
the United States has expanded aggressively, 
with the largest driver of growth coming from 
China. In 1999, roughly 515,000 international 
students were enrolled in undergraduate or 
graduate studies in the United States. This dou-
bled to 1,044,000 by 2015, with the number of 
Chinese students enrolled in American institu-
tions increasing nearly six-fold to 328,500 and 
the number from South Korea growing by one-
third to 61,000.

The presence of international students on 

campus has provided many benefits to Ameri-
can universities. For one, international stu-
dents provide a steady flow of income in the 
form of tuition because they are not eligible for 
federal or state government aid.

Yet perhaps most importantly, an inter-

national presence on campus imparts both 
domestic and international students with an 
intercultural competency necessary to com-
pete in a rapidly globalizing world.

Or so the theory goes.
In recent years, university administrators 

across the country have expressed growing 
concerns about the need to culturally integrate 
their international students into American cul-
ture.

In a February Marketplace interview, Uni-

versity President Mark Schlissel stressed the 
University’s commitment to fostering a global 
community within campus and increasing cul-
tural exchange.

“We’re educating all our students to operate 

in a global marketplace,” Schlissel said. “And 
in order to do that, they need to be exposed to 
people from different nations, different cul-

tures, as part of their education.”

******
As of winter 2017, the University enrolled 

3566 undergraduate and graduate students 
from China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Mon-
golia.

By far the largest population within this sub-

group is from China with 2717 people, accord-
ing to the same record. Yet even with 2717 
people from your country, attending school in 
a foreign country can be a frightening experi-
ence.

Filling in this gap, international student 

associations like the Chinese Students and 
Scholars Association provide relief from the 
daily stress of adjusting to an alien land and a 
space for students from the same country to 
feel back at home again.

Jason Xu, a School of Information senior 

hailing originally from Shanghai, finds these 
organizations useful for finding a community, 
but also thinks they can be a trap to prevent 
students like him from broadening their cir-
cles.

Xu explained that though he likes to spend 

time with other Chinese students, most of his 
friends are domestic American students. He 
said the tendency for fellow Chinese students 
to aggregate among each other is the “most 
common issue” he encounters.

“I feel like progress often takes place outside 

your comfort zone,” Xu said. “A lot of people 
in that comfort zone, they can’t speak English 
well, they don’t have American friends … it’s 
the same as studying in a Chinese university.”

And though Xu admitted he may have an 

edge in adapting to new environments because 
of his upbringing, having lived in both Hon-
duras and Macau, Xu argued in the end the 
comfort in staying with people from home will 
detract from the study abroad experience.

“I try to give myself a little bit of a chal-

lenge,” Xu said of stepping outside the Chinese 
community on campus.

Being said, Xu confessed he feels alien-

ated sometimes because in groups, he does not 
understand certain jokes or topics domestic 
students like to talk about. He said he prefers 
one-on-ones instead of groups so he can take 
time to know about people’s backgrounds and 
interests without having to follow the majority.

“I think everyone needs to have lunch and 

learn about their backgrounds and thoughts. I 
think it’s beneficial to me,” Xu said. “There’s no 
problem of communication if it’s one-to-one.”

Janine Meng, an LSA sophomore from 

Taiwan, said though she, like Xu, personally 

wants to better integrate herself into Ameri-
can culture, she knows several Taiwanese stu-
dents who came to the U.S. exclusively seeking 
research and networking opportunities — not 
to foster friendships with domestic students.

“Some students … they didn’t come here to 

make friends. They came here to study,” Meng 
said. “If interacting with their group of people 
is more easier to be on this campus, I guess they 
will just stay in the group.”

However, Meng explained she did not find 

her American friends without help from oth-
ers. Like many international students, she was 
afraid at first.

Meng’s faith helped her in the end. Because 

she was compelled to speak with others at her 
church — attended by both domestic and inter-
national students — she was able to break the 
barrier and create lasting relationships.

“I got to interact with domestic students … 

because (my) church is not an Asian church 
and I got to meet with a lot of new people, a lot 
of other freshmen,” Meng said.

Are cultural organizations preventing stu-

dents from integrating well? Ashley Wise-
man, interim director of the Global Scholars 
Program on campus, doesn’t think so. Though 
she stressed the importance of breaking from 
one’s comfort zone, Wiseman also sees cultural 
organizations playing a significant role in inter-
national students’ lives.

“It is important to connect to people who 

share that experience with you, being in a new 
place, being culturally marginalized,” Wise-
man said. “I actually wouldn’t want to take 
away from some parts of that, the benefits of 
forming community to support each other and 
celebrate each other.”

ShinDong Kim, an Engineering senior 

from the suburbs of Seoul, agreed with Wise-
man. Kim himself is not involved too heavily 
in campus Korean organizations, but he said 
he can see how these groups can actually help 
an international student assimilate better into 
U.S. society.

“It helps a lot to have people from the same 

nationality because they know what kind of 
struggle you go through and they’re able to 
help you out,” Kim said. “They can tell you 
what’s in Ann Arbor, how to go to places, get to 
places, what to do and they actually do it with 
you, so it’s a nice way to assimilate.”

In addition to student-facilitated organiza-

tions for international students, the University 
also seeks to provide opportunities for inter-
national and domestic students to learn from 
each other. That, Wiseman says, is the goal of 
the Global Scholars Program — a living-learn-
ing community for sophomores and above that 
gives domestic and international students a 
chance to live and interact with each other.

Participants live together in North Quad 

Residence Hall and attend courses aimed at 
raising their skills in intercultural communica-
tion. Domestic students are also encouraged to 
study abroad to cap off their global experience.

“The University of Michigan is such a large 

place. Without structured opportunities to 
interact … it can be hard for both international 
students and U.S. students … to build friend-
ships,” Wiseman said. “We might have diversi-
ty in numbers, (but) it’s getting that interaction 

to occur that can be a real challenge.”

GSP compels domestic and foreign students 

to interact and learn from each other in novel 
ways. Wiseman explained that when assign-
ing roommates, her team chooses two people 
who may have the most cultural differences. 
Students are also required to attend discus-
sions with peers from a diverse range of back-
grounds.

GSP also hosts mandatory dialogues about 

current events. Xu, who is a dialogue facilitator 
for GSP, said he tries not to frame the discus-
sion as a political debate but as an opportunity 
to gain multiple perspectives around a contro-
versial topic such as the issue of gun control in 
light of the Las Vegas shootings.

“We don’t want to get into politics — it’s easy 

to get into gun rights and people start arguing. 
We encourage personal experience,” Xu said. 
“(A student’s) friend’s dad passed away due to 
the shooting. People sharing different perspec-
tives so we can understand how serious the 
situation is and its impact.”

Wiseman said international students often 

come to GSP because they did not have a satis-
factory experience making friends their fresh-
man year. At North Quad, however, they find 
others who share the experience of being the 
only person of their nationality and faith and 
they quickly establish friendships.

“They come here and they find out that they 

have their difference in common,” Wiseman 
said. “So that really brings people together, 
feels like home, feels like family. … They feel 
celebrated and affirmed.”

The University’s International Center is 

also a resource for those who want to find 
friends among the international community. 
Kate Zheng, assistant director for Global 
Engagement and Education Abroad, said in 
the beginning of the academic year the Inter-
national Center focuses on programming that 
builds friendships between international stu-
dents so they can form an independent sup-
port network. Later on, the center actively 
acts as a springboard for students to step out 
of the comfort zone and interact with their 
peers from other cultures, including domestic 
students.

“I think it’s two-fold. On one hand, espe-

cially at the very initial stage, it’s crucial to 
have that support,” Zheng said. “But once they 
make their transition adjustment, we’re really 
here to encourage them to make more friends, 
friends who may be different from yourself.”

The International Center hosts events 

like monthly coffee hours and birthday cel-
ebrations as well as intercultural seminars to 
engage both domestic and international stu-
dents. Zheng said though attendance falters 
as the year goes on, she does not necessarily 
see this as a bad thing.

“Maybe eventually they find their own cir-

cle of friends and they want to do things that 
they are passionate and interested, which is 
great,” Zheng said. 

******
Historian Ronald Takaki once wrote: 

“There are no Asians in Asia.”

From a mainstream American perspective 

the statement may seem ridiculous, but to East 
Asian international students the statement is 
true. These students identify as Chinese, Kore-

an, Japanese — not the vague, general concept 
of Asian.

However, there are Asian Americans in the 

U.S. But that identity exists because we formed 
a political union despite the linguistic, eth-
nic and cultural distinctions between us to 
address our common issues.

This kind of rude awakening to the Ameri-

can phenomenon of race is not an uncommon 
experience among East Asian international 
students, who typically come from ethnically 
homogenous areas.

Given the current political environ-

ment, international students are constantly 
reminded of race in the United States. Meng, 
for instance, said she found it surreal that the 
political unrest she saw on TV in Taiwan was 
happening blocks away on a daily basis.

“You’ve always heard on the news, racial 

problems in the U.S. are a huge problem 
here, like what happened in Charlottesville,” 
Meng said. “But now here it’s like really 
experiencing, seeing these protests … that’s 
really interesting.”

Xu recalled when he first learned about 

the difference in prison incarceration rates 
between Blacks and whites, and was shocked 
at how race extends to every aspect of life in 
the U.S., including necessities like employ-
ment and housing.

“I never thought that skin color can make 

someone’s life so different,” Xu said. “I feel 
very upset about it because (there’s) not many 
things I can do.”

These kinds of realizations are not limited 

to race. Chingun Khasar, an Engineering 
senior from Mongolia, explained in his home 
country, LGBTQ individuals still face a heav-
ily prejudiced society and casually thrown 
insensitive comments and insults. He said he 
would have maintained his own prejudices if 

he stayed in Mongolia and was glad college 
provided him an ample opportunity to mean-
ingfully broaden his tolerance.

“In Mongolia, when they curse the worst 

thing is ‘you’re gay,’ ” Khasar said. “I didn’t 
know (the LGBTQ) community existed, and 
if I was in Mongolia I would probably have 
discriminated (against) them too, but coming 
here definitely changed my perspective.”

******
On campus, I’m part of the Japan Student 

Association, an organization that connects 
me with Japanese international students. 
But within this organization I believe inter-
national students are marginalized because 
the Japanese American community and 
those who attended American schools in 
Japan form a majority.

Other Asian ethnicities have separate 

organizations for those from the mother 
country and those who grew up in the United 
States. Yet I believe in the relatively smaller 
Japanese community we cannot afford a 
divide.

There are undoubtedly significant barriers 

for Japanese international students to over-
come while integrating to American campus 
culture.

Which is why what Kim said earlier about 

these organizations — that there’s a level of 
comfort in associating with people of your 
own background — offered me a path for-
ward.

Immigrants like me are often the closest 

to “Americans” these international students 
interact with. If individuals like me active-
ly seek to engage with them, to be by them 
side-by-side during their time in the U.S., we 
can bring them back into the fold of not just 
JSA, but also the University community as a 
whole.

Personal Statement: Puck

I

t’s March 1996. I’m only a few days old, 
and coming home for the first time. 
I was not old enough to remember 

anything, but I will always know this: my 
grandpa couldn’t be there for me when I was 
born, so he sent the next best thing — a giant, 
stuffed dog to hold his place as my companion 
until he could travel up from Chicago to visit me 
in Michigan.

***
I’m only a few weeks old and already proving 

to be a handful. I get stomach aches. I’m nosy, 
and anxious and curious. I’m particular about 
my surroundings, what clothes are on my body, 
who’s around me. But the biggest problem is I 
won’t sleep.

My grandpa comes up to visit on the weekends, 

when he isn’t working. My grandpa, grandma 
and mom all tag team to try to calm me to sleep. 
But it’s clear that my grandpa is particularly good 
at it — his calm presence lulls me. He rocks me, 
walking back and forth all night to the top of 
the stairs in my house and back. Even after I fall 
asleep, he continues to walk, just so I can rest. 
Through all hours of the night, we walk back and 
forth, in peaceful silence — one that I will find 
to be unique to our relationship, and one of my 
favorite parts about being around my grandpa. 
We’ve never needed words.

***
I’m two years old, visiting my grandparents’ 

house in Florida with my parents. The warm, 
muggy air that would grow to be familiar over 
many trips was still new, as was their expansive, 
bright ranch. But my grandpa and I are off on our 
own adventure.

There’s an owl nest in his neighborhood, and 

he wants to show me. We take a walk down 
the road, him patiently beside me and then, 
eventually, carrying me. He points out the nest 
to me — it’s dark, but I can still see. I see tiny 
baby owls, their eyes glowing in the darkness. 
He’s holding me tight. We go back to the nest 
often, the two of us.

***
I’m maybe three or four years old. I’m at my 

grandparents’ cottage in Northern Michigan 
with my cousins. My cousin Nick has just gotten 
a new toy — a talking Mr. Potato Head, from 
the new movie “Toy Story.” When you press a 
button, Mr. Potato Head will talk to you. My 
grandpa presses it.

“You’re a hockey puck!” Mr. Potato Head 

tells him.

My cousins and I crack up, and my grandpa 

joins right in.

“You’re a hockey puck!” we parrot back to 

him. He laughs, big and loud, his shoulders 
shaking — this is how he always laughed, 
even when the joke wasn’t funny. But this was 
hysterical — our grandfather, a hockey puck? 
We loved it.

My grandpa gave everyone a nickname — 

Leroy, Tutu, Au Revoir — random names that 
made him think of you; that’s how you knew 
you’d made it in with him. That day, my grandpa 
got his own: Puck. And that’s what we called 
him, from then on.

***
I’m four years old, sitting in my home in 

Michigan. My grandparents are visiting. Puck 
and I are sitting together at my kitchen table. 
We’re drawing together on big sheets of colored 
construction paper.

I love to draw with Puck. I love to do most 

anything with Puck. He’s patient with me, 
always looking at my creations when I call to 
him, letting me help with his careful, beautiful 
drawings. He’s a talented artist, always 
sketching — but when I’m there, the clean lines 
and accuracy don’t matter. I can help all I want.

***
I’m seven years old, and visiting my 

grandparents’ new cottage — a closer to 
make the journey from Chicago to Northern 
Michigan shorter. They decide to make a new 
purchase: a golf cart, a Northern Michigan 
staple. Puck and my brother go to pick it up a 
few days after we arrive — it’s bright yellow, and 
we all love it.

Puck endeavors to teach my cousins, brother 

and me how to drive it — an admirable decision, 
given we are all under twelve years old. We sit 
in the driver’s seat, with Puck next to us riding 
passenger. He shows each of us which pedal 
is the gas, which is the brake, how to turn the 
wheel and steer it where we want it to go. My 
brother, too small to reach the pedals, sits on 
Puck’s lap and steers.

We drive up and down the stretch of beach 

that backs up to their house; carefully back and 
forth on the shoulder of the quiet road in front 
of the house.

After a week, we are all proficient in driving 

the golf cart. My cousins and I draw up golf cart 
driver’s licenses for ourselves, complete with 
our best impression of a photo. We deliver them 
to Puck to notarize; he does so enthusiastically.

***
I’m nine years old, back at my grandparents’ 

Florida house. I’m still drawing regularly, 
carrying a small sketchbook with cartoon 
animals all over it wherever I go. I draw 
anything, and Puck loves it. He shows me his 
sketchbooks, full of meticulous drawings, 
especially of Timon and Pumbaa from “The 

Lion King,” his favorite movie. I am in awe. I 
love them.

He calls me over to his office one day, and 

hands me one of his sketchbooks, open to a 
blank page.

“I want you to draw something in here,” he 

says to me.

“Me? What do you want me to draw?”
“Anything you want,” he says. He promises 

he’ll love it, whatever it is.

I think about what to draw for hours, and 

finally settle on my at-the-time trademark: a 
cartoon monkey. I carefully draw the familiar 
shape, sign it, date it and deliver the sketchbook 
back.

“Thank you, El. I love it,” he looks at me. There 

are tears in his eyes. He gives me a big hug. “Great 
job.”

***
I’m 12 years old, muddling through middle 

school. Puck picks me up from school — he 
arrives 30 minutes before school lets out, and sits 
patiently in his car to wait for me to emerge. He 
loves this routine, one that we continue until I 
turn 16 and start to drive myself to school.

I come out of school and immediately spot 

his big, white Envoy. It’s been a tough day for 
me — my friends have turned out not to be great 
friends after all.

“Hey there, Miss El. You hungry?”
“Yeah. Maybe. I guess.”
“Alright, well let me know what you feel like,” 

he says.

We pull out of the parking lot, both of us quiet.
“Are you thinking about what you might 

want to eat?” he asks me a few minutes later. 
Immediately, I start to cry — hard. He sits next 
to me, patiently. I know now how much it hurt 
for him to watch me cry, but he did it without 
complaint. He puts his hand on my knee — his 
hand is huge compared to mine, and his nails are 
shorter — he was a chronic nail biter. I hold it. He 
drives another loop around the block, and then 
we go for ice cream.

***
I’m 17. It’s a few days before Christmas, and 

I’m in my grandparents’ house in Michigan 
— purchased a few years prior so that they 

could be closer to my family. Their house is less 
than a mile away from my own. We’re baking 
Christmas cookies, all sorts — chocolate chip, 
snickerdoodle, oatmeal, pizzelles.

I start to measure out ingredients. I dip my 

measuring cup into the flour.

“Wait!” Puck calls over. He hurries over to the 

silverware drawer, grabs a butter knife. “Take 
a big scoop,” he tells me. I take a heaping scoop 
— He reaches over and evens the measurement 
with the knife. “Perfect,” he proclaims. I dump 
it into the bowl.

We’ve been baking all day. I’m exhausted 

from the heat in their small kitchen, and from all 
the measuring, mixing, timing — I go to take a 
nap on the couch. Puck has assured me he’ll keep 
an eye on the cookies in the oven.

I come back into the kitchen and find him in 

his usual baking position: sitting on a step stool 
placed on the kitchen floor, directly in front of 
the oven, intently watching the cookies bake.

“I have to get them at just the right time,” he 

tells me.

***
I’m 18. It’s college move-in day. I’m terrified, 

but even more terrified of showing it. My 
stomach is filled with dread and anxiety as we 
load the car with what is going to become my 
entire life at school: bedding, small appliances, 
clothes.

My grandparents arrive to see me off. There’s 

not enough room in the car (or my future dorm 
room) for them to come along. They get out of 
the car, carrying a cardboard box. It’s filled with 
bottles of water — Smart Water, to be exact. It’s 
my favorite, because there are little pictures of 
animals on the labels. They want to make sure I 
have enough water to take with me.

Puck walks up, setting the box down next to 

the car.

“You ready, Miss El?”
He puts an arm around my shoulders, and I 

feel the lump in my throat get bigger. We stand 
together quietly for a few seconds, and then I 
look up at him, and tell him the truth.

“I’m really scared. I don’t want to go.” He 

squeezes my shoulder.

“I know you’ll be great.”
***
I’m 21, on another visit to Florida. We’re in my 

grandparents’ new condo, a recent move from 
the ranch that had gotten to be too big.

It’s a quiet morning; Puck and I are the only 

ones in the house. I’m reading, quietly, and he’s 
bidding on stamps online for his collection. The 
house is almost silent, each of us engrossed in our 
own tasks.

After a while, he leans over from his desk to 

look at me, sitting in the chair next to him.

“Hey, El,” he says. “Can I ask you a favor?”
He needs me to address an envelope for him 

— his hand tremor has gotten bad, and he can’t 
clearly write the address. I do it eagerly, copying 
down the address from another envelope.

“Oh, thanks so much. You’re my hero, El.” He 

smiles at me and pats my shoulder. I smile back.

We return to the peaceful silence. We never 

needed words.

Personal Statement: Bus #904 to Chelsea

W

hen I was a junior in 
high school, my sister 
moved away from our 
home in Michigan to 

pursue a career in the fashion industry in 
New York City. I was thrilled that my sis-
ter was finally pursuing her dream of liv-
ing in New York but saddened by the fact 
that I would no longer see her every day. 
After our initial trip to move her in, our 
contact decreased significantly. Navigat-
ing a long-distance relationship between 
a brother and sister was uncharted ter-
ritory for both of us. I would see 
her during big holidays but that was 
about it; I missed having the support 
of someone who knew exactly what I 
had gone through.

My freshman year of college, I 

finally planned a weeklong trip to 
New York to see the city as my sister 
knew it. I was so prepared for this 
trip to change my life and reignite 
our relationship — but what ended up 
being the most impactful part of the 
whole trip was getting there.

I opted for a $30 bus ride rather 

than a plane ticket because it was all I 
could afford. The bus was scheduled 
to depart at 5 a.m. to arrive in New 
York City 16 hours later. With that 
much time to waste, I packed my bag 
with books, enough sleeping pills to 
sedate a small elephant and a journal 
for the week.

I arrived at my bus stop at 4:45 a.m. 

and still remember the brisk morning 
— I could see my breath as I waited. I 
stood in line with about 30 other people, 
many cherishing one last cigarette before 
the long haul. I remember looking around, 
curious of everyone’s lives around me.

5:30 a.m.
We’ve finally boarded the bus. After 

some woman in the front got in a loud 
argument with the driver for a long 15 
minutes, she realized this bus was New 
York bound, not Newark. I had to wake 
up an angry man with a moustache and 
shimmy into the last seat next to him. He 
made himself comfortable, leaning on my 
shoulder and loudly snoring — I can still 
feel his moustache through my shirt. How 
do men with moustaches date when the 
sensation of being slightly brushed is so 
unnerving?

This is going to be a long trip.
8:43 a.m.
We’ve arrived in Cleveland. I don’t 

think there is anything more boring than 
watching the Midwest roll by. The man 
sleeping on my shoulder gets off and I 

can finally feel my arm again, which is all 
I’m really excited about. I’m curious what 
kind of business he had in Cleveland, or 
what business anyone has in Cleveland.

A woman in scrubs replaces the man 

with the moustache. I’m excited because 
if she ends up sleeping on me, I can push 
her off easier. She immediately introduces 
herself as Brita, “like the water filter.” I 
can’t imagine how many times she has 
had to say “like the water filter” in her 
life. She asks me why I’m headed to New 
York and I tell her about my sister. I ask 

her the same and Brita says she is trav-
eling to New York to meet her father for 
the first time. She explains her father was 
“a man who let his dick do the thinking.” 
Her mother was a librarian knocked up 
by a traveling businessman, so Brita was 
raised by a single mother. Brita and her 
husband were preparing to have a child 
and she wanted meet her real dad before 
raising a child of her own.

“He doesn’t know I’m coming, but we 

started writing letters back and forth 
about six years ago. He’s a property man-
ager out in Harlem now. I have his address 
and I’m going to surprise him.”

We share a pack of Starbursts as she 

continues telling her story. We agree 
pink and yellow get more hate than they 
should. I really hope everything pans out 
for Brita. I’m not sure she knows exactly 
what she wants to get out of meeting her 
dad, but I hope she finds it.

11:20 a.m.
We stop in Pittsburgh for a three hour 

layover. It’s the worst amount of time for 
a layover — I don’t have enough time to 
really explore, but I have too much time 
to simply sit. I lug my backpack and duf-
fle bag to a local restaurant and order 
some fennel salad that they’re apparent-
ly famous for. I wonder what Pittsburgh 
must be like if a salad can be famous here.

2:00 p.m.
Finally, back on the bus, I manage to 

secure the front seat on the second level. 
The seat has additional outlets and extra 
legroom — I think this is what first class 

on a bus feels like. I’m so tired of sitting. 
I admit watching Pennsylvania through 
a bus window is way more exciting than 
watching the Midwest. This state is full 
of beautiful mountains and farms; there 
is always something new to look at. I try 
to draw some mountains but I remember I 
don’t really know how to draw.

2:50 p.m.
I’m at a loss for words right now. From 

the time we departed Pittsburgh, the 
bus has been making worrisome noises 
— the kind you never want to hear from 
any vehicle. After every successive noise, 
passengers share worried looks — until 
there’s a loud boom and the back of the 
bus fills with thick grey smoke.

We pull over and everybody runs off. I 

sit on the side of the road in Pennsylva-
nia with a group of 60 or so strangers. It’s 
cold and it looks like it could rain any sec-
ond. We may not get another bus for four 
hours.

I’m beginning to understand why tak-

ing the bus is a last resort for many peo-
ple. Brita finds me and we watch “The 
Empire Strikes Back” on her computer.

5:50 p.m.
So this is what it feels like to be res-

cued from a desert island. I opt for back 
into my glorious first-class bus seat. This 
time a tall man with long, dark hair and 
a beard sits next to me wearing sandals, 
a brown vest and vertically striped green 
pants. Without saying anything, he hast-
ily begins sketching me. I pretend I don’t 
notice until he catches me staring.

“You’ve got a weird chin, I 

hope you’re not coming to New 
York to be a model.”

A little insulted, I tell him I’m 

going to New York to pursue my 
dream of being a foot model for 
flip-flop ads. He looks confused 
but seems pretty convinced. The 
guy introduces himself: Kent is 
running away from home to be a 
painter. He looks a little old to be 
“running away” — “moving out” 
would have probably been a more 
accurate phrase. I take a few 
sleeping pills and drift off.

11:40 p.m.
I wake up to see the bus 

entering the Lincoln Tunnel. I 
don’t think people realize how 
tiring it is to sit in one place for 
such a long time. Everyone is 
weary, but there might be some 
hope in the air.

12:18 a.m.
When we emerge from the 

tunnel and finally enter New York City, 
the bus is silent in awe. Eyes fixate 
on the skyline. It’s kind of humbling 
— everyone is coming to New York for 
different reasons, but nobody can deny 
being totally enchanted by the view.

1:20 a.m.
I have never been happier to reach a 

destination. I meet my sister. We get a 
slice of pizza.

After 20 hours, everything falls com-

fortably back into place — like putting 
on an old pair of gloves, things fit per-
fectly just as they had before.

The trip was totally fulfilling. My 

sister and I fell back into place, and 
our contact became more frequent and 
meaningful afterward, which is exactly 
what I wanted. I think seeing my sis-
ter felt even more satisfying because of 
how long the trip took — but more than 
anything, I think I have a new appreci-
ation for people taking the bus to New 
York.

The colorful graffiti and the stark interor of the building provide an excellent opportunity to photograph 
contrast. 

While Andy was teaching, this man approached us and stuck around, intently listening to the workshop 
before finding a new group to talk to.

I love how the three photographers all seem to be wearing the same combination of black raincoats on 
blue jeans. Their “uniform,” plus the fact you can’t see their faces, really suggests how photography is, at 
its core, rather invasive.

I was able to snap a quick photo of this man as he hurried down the street. 

A man walks his dog down Liberty Street while carrying his banjo and guitar. 

Andy’s tips on using reflections and glare to create a scene really came in handy here.

As students of the University of Michigan, it’s easy to forget that this town 
isn’t made up of solely 20-something-year-old transplants. On Saturday, 

CameraMall — a local camera shop — hosted a street photography 

workshop taught by Andy Shields, a Detroit-based street photographer. 

With students fleeing town for fall break, this presented an opportunity to 

capture members of the Ann Arbor community.
