MICHIGAN FOOTBALL
Rodriguez's
Michigan gear
auctioned off
for charity

Former head football
coach donates
473 Michigan items
to Salvation Army
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
WAYNE, Mich. - Just as the
University community is looking
forward to next football season
with a new coach, many here are
also hopeful for a new start -
something that will now be pos-
sible because of former Michigan
football coach Rich Rodriguez.
After being fired by the Univer-
sity's Athletic Department on Jan.
5, Rodriguez donated 473 Wolver-
ine-themed items to the Salvation
Army's Family Thrift Store in the.
Detroit suburb, according to the
Salvation Army's Maj. John Aren.
On Saturday, 160 of those items
were auctioned off during an event
titled "Coach's Closet."
Articles donated by the former
coach range from University of
Michigan T-shirts to hats and hel-
mets to shorts and pants. Rodri-
guez also autographed some of the
items, but he did not attend the
event.
More than 300 people par-
ticipated in Saturday's auction,
according to Aren. The Salvation
Army estimated that the total

proceeds from all 473 items were
$16,200. Of this total, $12,900 was
raised from the "Coach's Closet"
auction.
Proceeds from "Coach's Closet"
will benefit the Salvation Army's
Romulus Adult Rehabilitation
Center, which receives donations
from the storethroughout the year,
Aren wrote in an e-mail interview.
"There's 100 men there who are
counting on the funds," Aren, also
the administrator of the rehabilita-
tion center, said in an interview at
the event Saturday.
The rehabilitation center offers
housing, work and therapy to assist
individuals in re-entering society,
according to the center's website.
Without the sale of Rodriguez's
donations, Aren wrote that the
store probably would have sold
only $1,200 worth of merchandise
on Saturday.
The donations came after a
recent furniture store explosion
that killed two Wayne residents.
The same disaster response truck
that responded to the store explo-
sion three weeks ago was present
at the event and served free hot
chocolate to customers at the auc-
tion.
Aren wrote that this event could.
not have come at a better time for
the community.

As part of its 25th annual
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
Symposium, the University held
a series of events featuring key-

note speaker Shirley Sherrod and
renowned professor and come-
dian Bertice Berry.
Each year the University hosts
the largest Martin Luther King,
Jr. Day celebration in the coun-
try, according to the University's
Associate Vice Provost John
Matlock.
In her keynote speech, Sher-
rod, a civil rights activist and
former Georgia State Director
of Rural Development for the
United States Department of
Agriculture, discussed her role
in the civil rights movement

among other topics. She also
talked about her work as a stu-
dent activist working with the
Student Nonviolent Coordinat-
ing Committee (SNCC) and her
resignation from the USDA after
being accused in July of alleged-
ly discriminating against white
farmers.
Though the civil rights move-
ment ended when African Amer-
icans gained liberties like the
right to vote, Sherrod said there
is still a lot of progress to be
made.

By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily NewsEditor
For the second consecutive
year, the University's 2010 fiscal
year research expenditures have
topped $1 billion, according to
the University's Annual Report
on Research and Scholarship.
Stephen Forrest, the Univer-
sity's vice president for research

is scheduled to present the
report to the University's Board
of Regents at its monthly meeting
on Thursday. A summary of the
report was released yesterday'
along with the meeting's agenda.'
According to the report sub-
mitted to the regents, the Uni-
versity's total research spending
for the 2010 fiscal year, ending
June 30, was more than $1.1 bil-
lion - an increase of 12.1 percent
from fiscal year 2009.
The University ranks first in
research spending among all
public institutions in the coun-
try, according to data from the
National Science Foundation.
And the University is second

overall among all universities
nationally, trailing Johns Hop-
kins University.
Spending nearly $500 million,
the Medical School spends the
most on research of any unit at
the .University of Michigan and
consumes about 44 percent of
all expenditures. The College of
Engineering, the Institute for
Social Research, LSA and the

By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Five Guys Burger and Fries
located on South State Street
opened its doors yesterday to stu-

dents and Ann Arbor locals who
streamed in to get their burger
fix.
Originally set to open in
November, the restaurant opened
yesterday after construction
delays and time taken to hire
employees after winter break,
Brian Adelman, co-owner of the
Ann Arbor branch, said.
Adelman said this location is
the first of the Five Guys restau-

Group to educate
students, merchants
about panhandlers
By ANT MITCHELL
Daily StaffReporter
Many University students
and Ann Arbor residents have
not known what to do when

approached by panhandlers, and
now the city is looking to cut
down on these experiences.
Because of an escalation in the
frequency of these events, the
city has formed a panhandling
task force to work on solutions to
the problem. Formed in Septem-
ber, the task force is the second
attempt to decrease the number
of panhandlers in Ann Arbor
since a city group created in 2003

worked toward the same goal.
The current task force was
given a six-month time frame
to address the issue of panhan-
dling in the city. The first three
months were spent on research,
according to City Council mem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1), who
is chair of the panhandling task
force. The remaining months are
to be spent turning the group's

Blame detours for bus delays

Q: What causes delays in the Uni-,
versity bus system?
It's not an unfamiliar scene to
see a couple dozen students stand-
ing outside at abus stop in all sorts
of weather. And though University
Parking and Transportation Services
promises that buses run about every
10 minutes, many students who regu-
larly travel viaUniversity buses would
beg to differ.
According to the PTS website, the
University operates a total of 60 buses,
moving between North, Central
and South Campuses as well as the
Medical Campus and East Ann Arbor
Health Center.
Because of the abundance of con-
struction taking place in Ann Arbor
and on campus, buses are often faced
with the obstacle of creating new
routes to best accommodate students
and community members while
avoiding roadblocks.
Construction atthe C.C. Little bus

stop last summer caused a complete
shutdown of the central area for bus
pick-up and drop-off on Central Cam-
pus. As a result, temporary bus stops
were set up along South University
Avenue and other roads on campus.
And a water main break on North
Campus in January 2009 forced the
Bursley-Baits buses to take a detour
on Plymouth Road, and temporarily
shut daiwn the Northwood Express
route, according to a Jan.'15, 2009
Michigan Daily article.
The temporary detour led to
further delays from increased time
driving during rush hour driving and
longer routes, making many students
using the buses late for classes.
While road construction and
obstruction can cause traffic delays,
at times, the buses themselves create
the delay. Though the buses are oper-
ated by specially licensed individuals,
accidents do happen. It's not unheard
of for a University bus to get into a

minor accident with other another
vehicle.
In April 2010, a University bus rear-
ended a University Police patrol car
while it was parked near the Veterans
Administration Hospital, according to
an April 16, 2010 article in the Daily.
The police officer received non-life
threatening injuries, according to the
article.
In an attempt to reduce the number
of students waitingat the bus stop for
extended periods of time, the Magic
Bus feature on the PTS website shows
waiting times for each bus stop and
where buses are on their given routes.
There are also electronic displays at
the Michigan Union, the Michigan
League and Pierpont Commons that
show bus wait times, and touch-
screen displays in South Quadrangle
Residence Hall, Bursley Residence
Hall and the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library detail bus routes.
- DEVON THORSBY

Students wait for the bus at the C.C. Little stop - a
daily ritual for students who commute between North
and Central Campus.

Authorities said the holder was
discovered rattling around inside
a container during an inspection
of the plane's cargo shipments. All
of the flight's 169 passengers had
already deplaned.
"They found what appeared to
be detonator devices, but it turned
out to be empty containers that are
made to hold detonators. There
were no explosives inside them,"
said police spokeswoman Det.

American Airlines spokesman

holder "nothing threatening."

Nation honors Dr.
Martin Luther KIng

In light of shooting,
thousands gather
to remember King's
message of peace
ATLANTA (AP) - The nation
observed the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday yesterday with
thousands volunteering for ser-
vice projects and more reflecting
on his lessons of nonviolence and
civility in the week following the
shootings in Arizona.
Six people were killed in
Tucson and Democratic Con-
gresswoman Gabrielle Giffords
is fighting for her life. The vio-
lent outburst was a reminder to
many gathered at King's former
church in Atlanta that the Bap-
tist preacher's message remained
relevant nearly four decades after
his own untimely death at the
hands of an assassin.
Attorney General Eric Hold-
er praised him as "our nation's
greatest drum major of peace"
and said the Jan. 8 bloodshed
was a call to recommit to King's
values of nonviolence, tolerance,
compassion and justice.
"Last week a senseless ram-
page in Tucson reminded us
that more than 40 years after
Dr. King's own tragic death, our
struggle to eradicate violence
and to promote peace goes on,"
Holder said.
President Barack Obama and

first lady Michelle volunteered
to paint for a service project at a
middle school in Washington's
Capitol Hill. He urged Americans
to get out into their communities
- a step he suggested would have
special meaning following the
shootings.
"After a painful week where so
many of us were focused on the
tragedy, it's good for us to remind
ourselves of what this country is
all about," he said.
National and local politicians
joined members of the King fam-
ily at Ebenezer Baptist Church
in Atlanta to mark what would
have been the civil rights icon's
82nd birthday. Members of the
King family also laid a wreath at
the tombs of King and his widow,
Coretta Scott King, on the 25th
anniversary of the federal holi-
day established to honor the 1964
Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The largely African American
audience of about 2,000 gath-
ered at Ebenezer - where King
preached from 1960 until his
death in 1968 - included par-
ents and children, members of
the clergy, politicians and foot-
soldiers of the civil rights move-
ment.
Two of the Kings' four chil-
dren, Martin Luther KingII and
the Rev. Bernice King attended
Monday's ceremony. Their broth-
er, Dexter King, was unable to
attend the service because he
is recovering from injuries he
received in a car crash last year.

Yolanda King, the eldest of the
King siblings, died in 2007. Ber-
nice King is also president-elect
of the Southern Christian Lead-
ership Conference, which her
father co-founded in 1957.
Rep. John Lewis of Georgia,
who worked with King during
the civil rights movement, issued
a renewed call for Americans to
unite in peace and love as King
preached during his lifetime.
"If Dr. King could speak to us
today, he would tell us that it does
not matter how much we disap-
prove of another person's point
of view, there is never a reason
to deny another human being
the respect he or she deserves,"
Lewis said.
The Rev. Raphael Warnock,
pastor of Ebenezer, called for

Tunisia works toward
developing government

Three days after
president flees,
citizens protest
former ruling party
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - Tuni-
sia took a step toward democracy
and reconciliation yesterday,
promising to free political pris-
oners and opening its govern-
ment to opposition forces long
shut out of power - but the old
guard held onto the key posts,
angering protesters.
Demonstrators carrying signs
reading "GET OUTt demanded
that the former ruling party be
banished altogether - a sign
more troubles lie ahead for the
new unity government as secu-
rity forces struggle to contain
violent reprisals, shootings and
looting three days after the coun-
try's longtime president fled
under pressure from the streets.
"We're afraid that the presi-
dent has left, but the powers-
that-be remain," said Hylel
Belhassen, a 51-year-old insur-
ance salesman. Even before the
new government was announced
yesterday, security forces fired
tear gas to repel demonstrators
who see the change of power
as Tunisia's first real chance at
democracy.
President Zine El Abidine Ben
Ali fled Friday to Saudi Arabia
after a month of protests over
unemployment and corrup-
tion led to his downfall after 23
years in power. The government
announced yesterday that 78
civilians have died in the month
of unrest - an announcement
that underlined the depth of the
violence in the usually placid
Mediterranean tourist destina-
tion.
Under autocratic Ben Ali,
Tunisia was effectively under
one-party rule. The new govern-

ment named yesterday includes
three ministers from the oppo-
sition - a first in Tunisia - but
members of Ben Ali's RCD party
held onto mostofthejobs, includ-
ing the most important posts.
Security forces have gotten
an image makeover in the pub-
lic mind. The once-feared police
have been fighting snipers and
armed groups widely believed to
be Ben Ali loyalists.
Nearby nations, meanwhile,
faced a wave of self-immolation
attempts yeseterday, apparently
influencedby the desperate Tuni-
sian man who set himself on fire a
month ago, sparking the protests
that brought his president down.
In Tunisia, hundreds of
stranded tourists were still being
evacuated and foreign airlines
gradually resumed flights that
were halted when Tunisian air-
space closed amid the upheaval.
Besides the 78 civilians killed
in the monthlong protests, Interi-
or Minister Ahmed Friaa said 94
civilians were injured - a jump
from the previous official death
toll of 23. The new figure- does
not include members of security
forces, some of whom also died,
Friaa said.
Among victims of the violence
was a French photojournalist
who died Monday after being hit
in the face with a tear gas canis-
ter three days earlier. The French
Foreign Ministry said Loucas
Von Zabiensky-Mebrouk, 32, was
the "victim of a deliberate homi-
cidal act."
The troubles have reverber-
ated to the tourist-based Tuni-
sian economy, which Friaa said
has lost $2 billion because of the
unrest. Resort towns like Ham-
mamet are boarded up and under
police control, said Norredine
Gohdbani, who worked in a res-
taurant there and has returned to
stay with his family in Tunis.
Friaa told reporters that 85
police stations have been dam-

aged around the country, along
with 13 town halls, 43 banks, 11
factories and 66 stores or shop-
ping centers.
Streets of the capital appeared
calmer Monday but police were
posted on most corners in down-
town Tunis, with busloads of
forces waiting to deploy. Most
shops remained shuttered, but a
rare eatery, a pizza restaurant,
opened its doors - filled mostly
with hungry police officers.
Prime Minister Mohamed
Ghannouchi offered a number
of concessions to try to appease
Ben Ali's critics, while maintain-
ing the ruling party's dominance
of government and public posts
around the country.
Ghannouchi, a longtime Ben
Ali ally who has been premier
since 1999, retained his post,
as did the current ministers of
defense, interior and foreign
affairs.
Three opposition figures,
including Nejib Chebbi, a founder
of the opposition PDP party, will
take up posts in the new govern-
ment.
More significantly, Ghannou-
chi pledged such measures as
freeing political prisoners and
lifting restrictions on a leading
humanrightsgroup, the Tunisian
League for the Defense of Human
Rights. He said the government
would create three new state
commissions to study political
reform, investigate corruption
and bribery, and examine abuses
during the recent upheaval.
However, at least one union
leader said the changes were not
enough and predicted demon-
strations would continue until all
key figures ruling party had been
swept from power.
"It (the ruling RCD) left by
the back door and is coming back
through the window," said Habib
Jerjir, a member of the executive
bureau of the Regional Workers'
Union of Tunis.

A jolt from the Volt
The auto industry needs to replicate GM's model
After a concerning decline during the recession, Gen-
eral Motors is making a comeback. Earlier this month,
GM's recently released signature car, the Chevrolet Volt,
received Motor Trend Magazine's prestigious 2011 Car of the
Year award. The Volt's success marks the emergence of a new
generation of electric cars and will hopefully be a turning point
for GM. The invention could also help to boost Michigan's econ-
omy and the American auto industry as a whole. The American
auto industry should capitalize on GM's success and continue to
produce environmentally friendly cars.

Where's the finish line?

The Volt triumphed over 20 finalists, fin-
ishing in front of 10 Asian cars, six Euro-
pean cars and four other American cars for
the Car of the Year award. The criteria for
selection included advancement in design,
engineering excellence, efficiency, safety,
value and intended function. GM's prod-
uct is different from ordinary hybrid cars
because it runs solely on electricity when-
ever possible - with an electrical range of
50 miles per charge. Motor Trend Maga-
zine called the car a "game changer."
The win is important to the state and
the country as it signifies the resurgence of
the American auto industry. Most impor-
tantly for Michigan, this means more jobs
in a state that has one of the highest unem-
ployment rates in the country. But it also
means that many of these jobs will con-
tribute to sustainability and the develop-
ment of green technologies. In November,
GM announced that it would create 1,000
new engineering and development jobs in
Michigan as a part of its vehicle electrifica-
tion program. As GM continues to expand
and advance its production,- these job
opportunities are sure to increase.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and his
colleagues in Lansing and on Capitol Hill
should take note of GM's success. The
future of Michigan's economy depends on

innovative and green technologies rather
than gas-guzzling SUVs. In the past, inter-
national companies greatly outweighed
GM in advanced and efficient technologies,
but the Volt's emergence gives the Ameri-
can auto industry its first opportunity in a
while to lead the pact in smarter and more
fuel-efficient cars. On the national stage,
greater fuel efficiency also means a small-
er carbon footprint for the country and a
lower dependence on foreign oil.
The Volt reduces the environmental
impact of cars and provides an alternative
to the current market of hybrid cars. It was
named the 2011 Green Car of the Year by the
Green Car Journal and was the first electric
car to have won this award. In addition to
reducing carbon dioxide emissions, GM
recycles material by-products to make the
Volt a particularly practical and eco-friend-
ly car. With environmental threats like pol-
lution and global warming becoming more
serious, electric cars like the Volt will help
to alleviate these problems.
GM has created a product that will
boost the economy of the state and coun-
try as well as contribute to preserving the
environment. The Volt should become the
industry standard and auto companies
should work toward developing entirely
gas independent electric cars.

4 Waitingfor Superman" - a recent
documentary evaluating thestate
of public education - praised
charter schools'
efforts to hold stu-
dents accountable
through a strong
emphasis on test-
taking. Meanwhile, a
"Race to Nowhere"
- a film screened
at the University's
School of Educa-
tion last month -E
proclaims that the ERIK
overemphasis on TORENBERG
test taking over-
looks the skills stu-
dents really need to
be successful.
This paradox raises the question:
Should schools maintain such a test-
centered approach, or should they
work to develop alternatives for mea-
suring student success? Teaching to
the test risks that students will cling
to structure, burn out and adopt a
resume-centered existence. A more
holistic approach would be to focus
on developing creativity and criti-
cal analysis. Teachers could devalue
grades and encourage students to
think highly of themselves regardless
of performance.
Such an answer to the proposed
question is contingent on schools'
goals. If a school's ultimate goal is to
get its students into a top college and a
subsequent high-paying job, then yes,
a focus on test-taking and test prepa-
ration is conducive to such a goal. But
not all students will go to a top college.
And for those who don't, a fairly large
percentage will work jobs requiring
just a high school degree. "Waiting for
Superman" lauds college as the ulti-
mate goal of public education. Criti-
cism swarms that mindset not only
because of its narrow-mindedness
regarding personal development, but
also because, for some students, college
isn't necessarily a wise investment.
Assume schools decide to eschew

such a careerist approach, and instead
champion values such as compassion,
intellect and independent thinking. It
would become apparent that standard-
ized tests don't sufficiently measure
these abilities. If schools want to alter
the skills of their students, schoolswill
have to alter how they measure their
students.
But if schools lighten up, students
might too, and not necessarily in the
ways schools would like. "Race to
Nowhere" doesn't concede that stu-
dents might engage in unproductive
activities with their extra time. But
it's not self-evident that kids will start
their own businesses, read more and
engage in community service if they
spent less time worrying about earn-
ing top GPAs. It might even be pre-
sumptuous to assume that a school's
view toward tests can affect student
behavior. It's likelythat Lady Gaga and
LeBron James-like figures playa large
part in forming students' identities.
The same can't immediately be said for
a school's method of evaluation.
As this analysis has demonstrated,
questions initially proposed unravel
separate, more profound questions
upon inspection. What is the best
method to measure student success?
That would depend on how schools
define student success. What is the
best method to hold teachers account-
able? That hinges on what attributes
schools value in their teachers.
Taking a stab at these questions is
far beyond the scope of this article, so
let's first focus on what's clear. What's
apparent about the education system
is that everyone has problems with
it. Math scores of American students
have been steadily falling relative
to students in other countries. Vast
inequalities exist between schools
located just minutes of each other.
Those invested in the debate are
eager to answer the big questions.
Education Policy Adviser Ken Robin-
son excitededucationenthusiasts with
a couple of TED - a conference that
brings together people from the Tech-

nology, Entertainment and Design
industries - talks. He highlighted the
importance of replacing conventional,
linear models with more holistic ones
that unearth creative potential. But
his follow up books haven't answered
the "how-to," and people are still
awaiting the all-encompassing narra-
tive - in book or documentary form
- that promises to reconcile the insti-
tutional, economic and cultural prob-
lems that plague our education system
today.
Students can't
wait for
superman.
We're not going to receive a magic
formula for fixing schools because
we don't fully agree on the para-
digms underlying the problems. This
ideological stalemate will continue
to subsist, but that doesn't mean stu-
dents should complacently sit around
the proverbial dinner table while the
"adults" talk about how to "fix" the
education system. As these docu-
mentaries demonstrate, anyone can
be portrayed as a victim. It's easy to
notice the inherent complexity sur-
rounding educational policy and
refuse to proclaim any responsibility
or agency, but such complacency is
self-defeating. It's imperative that we
- high school and University students
alike - analyze the "race to nowhere"
the documentary suggests we're par-
ticipating in and define for ourselves
what we want to gain from our educa-
tional opportunities. If we don't, we'll
continue waiting for some superman
to decide that for us.

Don't be quick to connect the dots

For years, food in one way or another has
ruled my life. I'm known among friends and
family for my insatiable appetite, and even
many of my early memories in life are associated
with what I ate rather than where I was or who
I was with. I can still clearly remember the first
time I had a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut:
in the airport after arriving in Orlando for the
first time. And therein lies my problem. I grew
up craving and always asking for fast food - the
delicious salt and fat were irresistible to me. But
after reading Michael Pollan's "The Omnivore's
Dilemma," I feel that I've taken many steps in
the right direction to having a healthier, more
complete relationship with food.
Ever since I enrolled in Environment 201 last
year, and I learned about the problems of indus-
trial food - of which I view fast food as the
pinnacle - I've started to think about the way
I eat and the consequences it has. I've always
known that eating McDonald's and Wendy's
isn't the healthiest, but I was a fit athlete. What
do I care if I eat an extra 750 calories or 200mg
of salt a day? But after learning about the envi-
ronmental problems caused by the increasing
industrialization of food, I've started to eat
much healthier. I'd say that my diet change has
been years in the making. I won't be young and
fit forever, and neither, for that matter, will the
environment.
What I found interesting about "The Omni-
vore's Dilemma" was the detailed outline
offered on the ways humans can get their
food. The categories included: industrialized/
processed foods, hunter/gatherer and organic
farming. To be honest, a vast majority of the
people I know eat almost exclusively from the
first category. I've never seen my mom go out-
side to pick mushrooms or berries for her daily
salad. It's just so much more convenient to
drive to Meijer and by pre-packaged and har-
vested ones. Unless a person lives in the middle
of a lush rain forest and knows what foods are
safe to eat, the second option of foraging for
your own food is laughably unlikely. The days
when a person spent all day outside to catch,
find and pick enough food to sustain them-
selves are long over - in this country at least.
While I enjoyed reading about this.method, I

know that it isn't realistic enough to fit into my
life. Sure, if I'm camping, and I find some wild
raspberries, I'll eat them. But I don't go camp-
ing enough for that to change my life.
The last option, organic farming, is another
option that's tricky. With companies across
the world jumping on this trend, saying their
products are "natural," "organic" and "envi-
ronmentally-friendly," it's hard to figure out
what's really healthy and what's just trying
to make a quick profit. Another problem is
the industrialization of organic farming. This
process, developed to make organic food more
readily available to the masses, is just the same
we've seen with the fast food revolution. It's
another way of taking something pure and
healthy and bastardizing it to make money.
No, I don't think eating - often over-priced
- organic food is the best option for myself or
for omnivores in general. But if you live on an
organic farm and can make your own food, by
all means do so.
So my journey from starting college two and
half years ago and reading this book over the
past month has led me to a very enlightening
conclusion: Use your head and be as personal
with your food as possible. It may not be the
biggest epiphany the world has seen, but it's
done wonders for me. What I mean by this is
that you should embrace the positives in all
options: the convenience of industrialization,
the health and simplicity from real organic
farming and the personal touch from forag-
ing. How do I plan to do this? It's simple. I'm
planning on grocery shopping for myself - as
well as purchasing food from the Ann Arbor
Farmers Market - buying fresh meats and pro-
duce whenever possible and preparing my own
meals. Reading "The Omnivore's Dilemma" is
actually a big reason why I plan to live outside
the dorms next year I want more control
over what I'm eating. I think this is a plan that
will work for me and help me lead a healthier
life. But most importantly, it's something I can
actually follow. And that's more than can be
said for someone planning to forage in the Arb
for berries and mushrooms.

MESA-Trotter House celebrates
40 years of community on campus

Vice Provost Lester
Monts announces
$10,000 donation to
multicultural center
By PAIGE PEARCY
For the Daily
A large group of students,
alumni, faculty and guests gath-
ered Sunday to celebrate the
anniversary of the Office of
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs
and the William Monroe Trotter
Multicultural Center. Since their
founding, MESA and the Trot-
ter House have aimed to promote
acceptance and multicultural
development by informing and
supporting University student
organizations.
By mid-afternoon on Sunday,
about 70 people joined the anni-
versary celebration at the Trot-
ter House on Washtenaw Avenue.
Visitors were greetedby the sound
of jazz music to celebrate the com-
mencement of the year-long com-
memoration. Multiple speakers,
singers, rappers and students
expressed their gratitude and
reflections about the organization
and the center at the event.
Evans Young, LSA assistant
dean for undergraduate educa-
tion and the opening speaker at
the event, said that throughout
the center's 40-year history, there
have been two constant factors
- challenges working with "very
limited budgets" and the dedica-
tion of community members.
"In the face of those budgets

and just by the nature of the peo-
ple involved, a history of very cre-
ative staff, students and faculty
engaged in making this a home for
students of color at the University
of Michigan," Young said.
MESA and the Trotter Mul-
ticultural Center started in 1971
after the Black Action Movement
sponsored demonstrations at the
University. The series of events
prompted awareness of a need
for a campus organization for
black students in which impor-
tant issues could be addressed. In
1981, the organization expanded
to include students of all races and
ethnicities.
Lester Monts, the University's
senior vice provost for academic
affairs, said at the event that stu-
dent protest was "very effective
in bringing about change" during
MESA and Trotter's beginnings.
Monts ended his address by
donating $10,000 of his office's
budget to MESA and Trotter
House's newly-established annual
fund.
Henry Johnson, vice president
emeritus of Student Services at
the University, told the audience
of the progress the organization
has made to achieve its current
position on campus.
"I think the corner has been
turned and Trotter House is
beginning to fulfill its mission as a
multicultural programming site,"
Johnson said.
MESA aids numerous student
organizations including- events
organized by sorority Delta Tau
Lambda - a traditionally Latina
sorority that represents all women
of color.

LSA sophomore Guadalupe
Ayala, a member of Delta Tau
Lambda, said she decided to
attend Sunday's event to support
her sorority sister who spoke on
the student panel. Ayala said she
also wanted to show her appre-
ciation for MESA helping the
sorority with multiple events and
programming.
"(Trotter House is) a place
where we can come and actually
be heard and supported to put up
our events on campus," she said
The University of Michigan
Gospel Chorale, formerly the Uni-
versity of Michigan Black Gospel
Choir, performed at the event, and
was followed by reflections from
faculty and students involved
with MESA.
LSA senior Jessica Perez spoke
on a student panel that discussed
the influence MESA and the Trot-
ter House have had on students'
lives and the future of the organi-
zation.
"I think it's time for MESA-
Trotter, especially with this
40-year mark, to see where
they have come from but not to
stop," Perez said. "There's a lot
of hard issues just waiting (to
be addressed) ... and I think it's
time."
Rackham student Kya Man-
grum said she came to the event
not knowing much about MESA's
or the Trotter House's history.
"I was really impressed by the
sense of community here - the
sense that people felt at home
here," Mangrum said. "It was
enlightening, and I think it's going
to encourage me to come visit
more."

rhetoric to affect change. The rea-
son King's speeches were inspira-
tional, Berry said, is that he would
spend hours critically thinking
about his words in order to deliver
them effectively.
"It's amazing to me that we
don't think about King as a great
thinker, we think about him as a
man of faith," Berry said. "But
have you ever read the letter from
the Birmingham jail where he
cites and crosses out and corrects
his own stuff from his own mind?
This is a thinker."
Berry also spoke about the role
of technology in today's society.
According to Berry, while the
current generation may be more
technologically advanced than
their elders, younger people lack
wisdom. Because of this, she said
it is the job of the older generation
to guide the younger generation.
"Some of us (elders) are so frus-
trated with you, but it is our job to
go, 'Yes, it should be your call to go
forward faster than I can go, but
not so fast,"' Berry said.
Engineering freshman Trebec-
ca McDonald said Berry inspired
her to think critically about her
ideas and the importance of
King's message.
"I thought she did a really good
job at trying to make us think and
trying to open our minds, so we
not only look at (King's) speeches
and memorize the words for how
powerful they were, but to actu-
ally know that they had meaning
and that they were a thought pro-
cess," McDonald said.

She said she thought Berry's
message will also help her in her
learning process.
"It will impact (my studies)
because it will help me to not take
things at face value," McDonald
said. "Especially in the College of
Engineering where you have to do
problem solving and you have to
kind of think outside of the box."
In addition to Sherrod and
Berry's speeches, the symposium
also featured several lectures and
activities throughout the day,
including performances on the
Diag in an hour-long event titled
"Circle of Unity."
University alum Robin Gold-
berg, the event coordinator, said
the festivities were developed so
that students could engage in civil
rights issues and talk about how
they impact their future.
"The event is meant to give peo-
ple and groups a chance to express
their hopes for the future and dis-
cuss their experience of the civil
rights movement," Goldberg said.
The symposium also included
a poetry slam titled "We the Peo-
ple." The performance featured
Ann Arbor native Angel Nafis,
who discussed her experiences
growing up as "an African Ameri-
can girl in a predominantly white
society." Actress Val Gray Ward
also spoke at the event, narrating
historical events and struggles in
the civil rights movement.
"I definitely think that the arts
are a way of impacting the com-
munity positively," Ward said in
an interview after the show.


PANHANDLING
From Page 1A
discussions into policy.
"We'll need to involve the Uni-
versity community," Briere said.
"Every year there is something
like six or seven thousand new
University members, and these
are people who have no long-term
ties to Ann Arbor ... they aren't
familiar with what's common."
The task force plans to remedy
this problem by annually supplying
information to the public, speifi-
cally new students at the Univer-
sity, so that they are informed
about how to respond to panhan-
dlers without offering money.
Briere said the task force has also
recommended that information on
panhandling in the city should be
provided at the University's new
student orientation, in the Uni-
versity's student handbook, on the
University and city of Ann Arbor
websites, as well as displayed in
State Street store windows.
Briere described the internal
struggleofindividualsapproached
by panhandlers - whether to dis-
cuss housing, food and addiction
treatment options with them or
simply give them money. Often
people choose to give money with-
out understanding that, for many
panhandlers, addiction is usually
the real problem, she said.
There are a number of pro-
grams in Ann Arbor and the sur-
rounding area, Briere said, like
Dawn Farm - a shelter for alcohol
abuse - and programs through
the court system to ensure addicts
get help instead of jail time.
"People who are feeling sorry
for someone who says, 'I'm hun-
gry, I'm homeless, I need a bus
ticket out of here,' may think
they're providing .something,
but they're really only providing
money so somebody can feed their
addiction," she said.

While some panhandlers pres-
ent signs claiming hunger and
homelessness, Briere said holding
a sign-doesn't necessarily mean an
individual has a problem finding
food or shelter. Many panhandlers
make more than $100 a day, and
have their own residences, Briere
explained.
"It's not about being homeless:
Most panhandlers are not seeking
money because they need to pay
the rent," Briere said.
According to Briere, many pan-
handlers have shelter available to
them, but choose to" avoid these
locations because they have rules
the panhandlers are unwilling to
follow..
She added that one contributing
factor to the panhandling problem
is the increase of panhandlers
coming from beyond Ann Arbor.
Collaboration with local mer-
chants is another goal of the task
force. Calling the police is one
option, but conversation between
store' owners and panhandlers
about solicitation laws and
ensuring that customers aren't
being bothered is another way to
improve the situation, Briere said.
She said this also requires
cooperation between neighbor-
ing businesses and their clients -
something that happens more on
Main Street than on State Street
and South University Avenue.
"The businesses are less orga-
nized, less interactive - or so I
understand from speaking with
them ..." Briere said. "It's going to
be interesting to change that out-
reach between the businesses so
they work with each other."
Maggie Ladd, chair of the origi-
nal panhandling task force and a
current member of the present
task force, said the task force did
a good job the first time in reduc-
ing the amount of people giv-
ing money to panhandlers. But
because businesses in the area
have changed over time, there's a

need to revitalize the distribution
of information on the-issue.
"I think that when the task
force stopped, perhaps we didn't
continue distributing that infor-
mation as well as we could have,"
said Ladd, who is also the execu-
tive director of the South Univer-
sity Area Association.
This time, however, the task
force faces a new issue. In 2003,
the city had community policing
in place, which involved having
police officers on bicycles in the
downtown area during both the
day arid night. And while police
officers on call are still available,
Ladd said the city needs to find
a substitute for the community
patrol part of the program.
"By virtue of losingthose, we've
lost a lot of the ability to do that
enforcement ... These community
police officers were there all the
time, and they interacted with the
panhandlers, they knew them and
so that's the piece I feel personally
is missing."
Sgt. Mike Lance of the Ann
Arbor Police Department said the
removal of officers was due to a
reduction in personnel with the
AAPD losing more than 100 staff
members in recent years.
However, the University's
Department of Public Safety has
University police officers patrol
Central Campus during the sum-
mer months. Sales and solicitation
of any kind in a University build-
ing or on campus grounds must be
given written permission, accord-
ing to.article 9, sections 1 and 2 of
the University Regents' Ordinance.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said that while University
Police could issue a citation for
violation of the Regents' Ordi-
nance or arrest panhandlers if
they became aggressive, in most
cases, officers simply ask them to
move along. In certain situations,
Brown said, officers ask panhan-
dlers to leave University grounds.


REGENTS
From Page 1A
the University's research funding,
totaling about $750 million in fis-
cal year 2010 - an increase of 14.7
percent from the preceding year.
Additionally, the University
received $301.1 million in federal
stimulus funds to be used in fis-
cal years 2010 and 2011. Accord-
ing to the report, the stimulus
money has funded more than 547
research projects at the Univer-
sity.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said in an interview last
month that the University has a
strong relationship with the fed-
eral government.
"Throughout my whole career
I've been at a number of research
universities and Michigan is the
one, I think, that takes advantage
of the fact that our faculty have a
partnership with the federal gov-
ernment to do research - some
of it's basic, some of it's more
applied," Coleman said.

REGENTS TO APPROVE $1.5 BOARD TO CONSIDER $2.5
MILLION UPGRADE TO ISR MILLION UTILITY TUNNEL
BUILDING RENOVATION

The regents will also deliberate
about $4 million worth of cam-
pus construction projects at their
meeting Thursday.
Among the projects to be con-
sidered is a $1.5 million improve-
ment to the fire suppression system
in the existing Institute for Social
Research building, colloquially
called Wing One.
In a communication to the
regents, Tim Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president and
chief financial officer, wrote that
the new fire suppression system
will allow for an addition to the
ISR building to be built without a
fire separationhwall between the
addition and the existing struc-
ture. The regents approved the tSR
addition in July 2010.
If approved, the project will be
funded by both the ISR and the
Office of the Provost. The installa-
tion of the system is expected to be
completed in the spring of 2012.

The regents are also expected to
green light a $2.55 million project
to renovate utility tunnels beneath
Central Campus under Huron
Street. This project will renovate
500 feet of the tunnels, in addition
to replacing120 feet of the tunnels,
according to Slottow's communi-
cation to the regents.
Slottow wrote in the communi-
cation to the regents that this new
project is part of a series of refur-
bishments to utility tunnels that
distribute power to campus from
the University's Central Power
Plant.
"In 2006 a master plan for tun-
nel infrastructure renewal was
developed that prioritized a series
of tunnel projects, and several
have been completed," Slottow
wrote.
If approved, construction on the
tunnels is estimated tobe complet-
ed in winter 2012, and funding will
come from University Utilities.

ir Obama to honor China's
president with state dinner

An employee prepares burgers at the new Five Guys Burgers and Fries on South State Street yesterday.

TODD NEEDLE/Daily

FIVE GUYS
From Page 1A
said in the afternoon, adding that
he's experienced opening days
that are busy from open to close.
During the wait, peanuts are
available for customers to snack
on in the dining area. There's also
a monitor that shows the lower
floor so customers can check for
open tables before going down-
stairs.
Adelman said he was unaware
the opening fell on the same day
as Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
when he picked Jan. 17. He said
opening on a Monday is preferable
since it allows for a good buildup
to the weekend, which tends to be
the busiest business days for Five
Guys.

Rackham students Tyler and
Darcy Huismann, who went to
Five Guys yesterday, said they
thought the holiday could even
increase business because stu-
dents have extra time to go out to
eat since there weren't any classes.
They also expressed how much
they like Five Guys, saying that
they limit the condiments they
put on their burgers "because the
burger itself is so good," Darcy
said.
All of the toppings - such as
lettuce, tomato, pickles and mush-
rooms - are included in the price
of each burger. Five Guys "regu-
lar" burgers at $4.99 all have two
patties while their "little" burgers
have one, priced at $3.69.
LSA junior Jacob Van Ooster-
hout, who ate at the restaurant
yesterday, said he'd been to a Five


Guys previously and enjoyed the
"exceptionally high-quality" food.
"I can foresee spending a lot of
money here," Van onsterhout said.
Engineering sophomore Ste-
phen Cprek said he'd never been
to a Five Guys before yesterday
but decided to come with some
friends to try the food.
"(It is) much better than the
Shaman Drum Bookshop," Cprek
joked, referring to the bookstore
that previously occupied the
space.
Ann Arbor resident Ted Hughes
said he planned ahead to come
opening day. He said he travels all
over the country for business and
is already a loyal customer to the
chain.
"For me, it's the only fast food
burger that's as good as In-N-Out
Burger," Hughes said.

Ru to come to
Washington for
first China dinner
in 13 years
WASHINGTON (AP) - When
Hu Jintao makes what is likely his
final trip to Washington as China's
president, he will get an honor
he desperately wanted but was
denied during his first visit nearly
five years ago: a White House state
dinner.
Symbolism and protocol are
very important to the Chinese
and the opulence of Wednesday's
black-tie affair with President
Barack Obama should be plenty
satisfying for Hu, a 67-year-old
hydroelectric engineer who has
ruled the country since 2002. That
could help relations between the
leaders of the world's two largest
economies.
A grand soiree is in the works,
but big questions remain. Will
a celebrity chef do the cooking?
Will first lady Michelle Obama's
gown have an Oriental flair? Will
the Obamas try to turn Hu on to
American pop culture with the
entertainment? The White House
has yetcto release any details.
But Mrs. Obama, White
House social secretary Julianna
Smoot and other staffers deep-
ly immersed in pulling off the

administration's third state din-
ner hope to avoid repeating the
slights, both perceived and real,
that marred Hu's reception for an
April 2006 summit..
For starters, Hu was unhappy
that President George W. Bush
opted for lunch over a state dinner.
Bush held few state dinners as
president, preferring workman-
like visits with foreign leaders
over eating meals in a tuxedo. He
also was sensitive to concerns in
the U.S. about human rights in
China and was reluctant to be seen
as going all out for Hu with a state
dinner.
Hu was welcomed with a pomp-
filled arrival ceremony on the
South Lawn, including a military
honor guard and a 21-gun salute.
But the reception was spoiled
when a woman protesting China's
treatment of the banned Falun
Gong religious movement began
shouting during his remarks.
Bush personally apologized
after they had retreated to the
oval office.
During the ceremony, a White
House announcer flubbed Chi-
na's formal name by calling it the
"Republic of China" instead of the
"People's Republic of China." The
Republic of China is the formal
name for Taiwan, the democratic
island that China claims as its ter-
ritory.
Wednesday's affair will return
the hospitality that Obama was

shown at a state dinner in Bei-
jing when he visited in November
2009.
A personal relationship
between the two leaders is impor-
tant, Asia watchers say. Obama
and Hu will have at least two
more years to work together. He is
expected to relinquish his leader-
ship of the Communist Party next
year and the presidency the year
after.
"It's such a big relationship.
It's like two aircraft carriers,"
said Victor Cha, a former direc-
tor of Asian affairs in the Bush
White House. "The only way you
can move policy is at the very top
and it requires a personal connec-
tion."
Cha said that personal element
seemslackingbetween Obamaand
Hu, who will meet for the eighth
time in two years on Wednesday.
"Maybe this visit will be an
opportunity to create some of
that," Cha said.
Hu is actually getting two din-
ners with Obama.
A small, private dinner at the
White House was on tapafter Hu
lands in Washington on Tuesday,
including Secretary of State Hill-
ary Rodham Clinton, National
Security Adviser Tom Donilon
and some Hu aides.
The state dinner is the first
for China in 13 years and follows
Obama state dinners for India and
Mexico.

. 7-Eleven searches for its place in the A2 community

Convenience store
criticized for
'eliminating the mom
and pop shops'
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Students craving for a Slurpee
now need to look no further than
State Street for a Hawaiian Punch
or Coca-Cola frozen treat.
A new 7-Eleven opened early this
month at 318 S. State St. in the retail
space formerly occupied by Ritz
Camera. While some Ann Arbor
residents have expressed concern
about the chain displacing a local
business, the convenience store's
owner, Linda Russ, is striving to
prove its place in the community.
Russ said she hopes the store will
quickly become a part of Ann Arbor
and a place cherished by its resi-
dents.
"We're not looking to be an out-
sider chain," Russ said. "We're part
of the city."
Russ said she would like the store
to become a member of the State
Street Association and the Ann
Arbor/Ypsilanti Regional Chamber
of Commerce in an effort to cre-
ate more of a community-oriented
establishment.
"We've had some people come
in and say that we are eliminating
the mom and pop shops," Russ said.
"We're not eliminating anybody."

Diane Keller, president and CEO
of the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Region-
al Chamber of Commerce, said the
new 7-Eleven's chain-store affilia-
tion wouldn't hamper Russ's efforts
to gain membership to the chamber.
"We've got a lot of organizations
that are chains that are members of
the chamber of commerce," Keller
said.
When asked her opinion on the
criticism that 7-Eleven has faced
from local residents, Keller said it's
important to note how chain stores
in the area are able to serve the spe-
cific communities where they're
open for business.
"If a business is conscientious of
the needs of its community, then
that's what counts," Keller said.
Russ said the State Street 7-Elev-
en's main clientele are students. A
study lounge in the upper level of
the store is opening soon and will
have tables, chairs and couches to
seat 47 people. The space will also
feature artwork from University
students.
She added that the lounge will
be cleaned frequently and equipped
with security cameras to ensure
that it remains a safe, clean place to
study.
"No smoking, no drinking, no
sleeping," Russ said.
Since its opening, Russ said busi-
ness has been steadily on the rise as
more students have become aware
of it.
"We started offslow in thebegin-
ning," Russ said. "Now we're start-
ing to pick up."

While the store is open 24 hours
a day, Russ said peak hours are
between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. In addi-
tion to the store's student clients,
the store also caters to a variety of
groups in the area, including police
officers, city personnel and con-
struction workers, Russ said.
The store will also begin sell-
ing beer and wine after receiving a
liquor license from the city of Ann
Arbor, Russ said, though she added
that she doesn't know when the
store will receive the license.
Russ said she doesn't view her
store as a competitor to the locally-
owned Diag Party Shoppe, located
several doors down from 7-Eleven
on State Street. The nearby Diag
Party Shoppe is not a member of
the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Regional
Chamber of Commerce, according
to the chamber's website.
"I don't think we're competing
because we have a different prod-
uct line," Russ said. "Our prices are
lower."
Russ said Jerome Kamano,
owner of Diag Party Shoppe, visited
her store recently and commented
on how 7-Eleven's low prices will
affect his business.
"He's already been in here and
did a tour, and asked us to do some
things to work with him," Russ said.
But Russ said she wouldn't make
any accommodations for Kamano.
"We're not going to raise our
prices to match neighbors' prices,"
Russ said. "We have a fair price."
When asked about the interac-
tion with Russ, Kamano said he

didn't ask the 7-Eleven owner to
raise prices when he toured the
store, adding that the products are
already expensive.
"Her prices are not cheap,"
Kamano said. "She's very high on a
lot of her items."
Kamano said he instead advised
Russ on ways to safeguard her store
against theft and that he isn't wor-
ried about the competition between

the two stores.
"I was just trying to be nice to
her as a friendly neighbor," Kamano
said. "I'm not mad she's here. If she
wants to pay that $17,000 a month
rent, I'm more than happy."
After visiting 7-Eleven sev-
eral times last week, Art & Design
sophomore Tiffany Hu said she was
impressed with the variety of prod-
ucts the store offers and is looking

forward to the forthcoming lounge.
"It's convenient for students," Hu
said.
Ann Arbor resident Ryan Nisbett
said he isn't happy about another
chain moving in, and that he's wor-
ried about what this will do to busi-
ness for local companies.
"The Diag (Party Shoppe) down
here is probably going to start suf-
fering," Nisbett said.

Rumors and questions surface as
former Haiti dictator stays in hotel

Duvalier's motives
for returning to
country unclear
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
- From a posh hotel room, Hai-
ti's former dictator Jean-Claude
"Baby Doc" Duvalier greeted old
friends and allies while provid-
ing no public insight into why he
suddenly returned to the country
he fled amid a popular rebellion a
generation-ago.
The lack of information left
Haitians to speculate on what the
appearance of the exiled former
president-for-life could mean for
the country, its efforts to build out
of poverty - and what other politi-
cal surprises might be coming
amid an increasingly problematic
electoral crisis.
The immediate speculation
was on whether the ex-dictator's
return is a mere precursor to a
potentially more epochal event:
a return by the man who helped
lead the movement to topple him,
ex-President Jean-Bertrand Aris-
tide, who has been in South Afri-
can exile since 2004.
Haitian radio repeated rumors
throughout the day that Aristide
was headed for Panama or Cuba,
en route to Port-au-Prince. There
was no immediate indication
those reports were true.
Aristide's attorney in Miami,
Ira Kurzban, said the ousted for-
mer president, who remains popu-
lar in Haiti, wants tQvcome back to
his homeland.
"President Aristide has said he
desires to return to his country.
His position is that he's always had
a right to his return," he said.
U.S. State Department spokes-
man P.J. Crowley was compelled
to say in a Twitter post that "We
are not aware of any plans for for-

mer President Aristide to travel to
Haiti."
Historian Georges Michel said
such an occurrence would over-
shadow Baby Doc's return.
"You have some people excited,
but you have not seen big excite-
ment in the streets like when
(singer) Wyclef (Jean) arrived or
if Aristide would return from his
exile," he said.
Another theory: President
Rene Preval was behind Duva-
lier's return to create a distraction
from the problematic presidential
election in which Preval's chosen
candidate is deadlocked against a
popular carnival singer for a posi-
tion in the second round, which
was supposed to take place the day
Baby Doc arrived.
"They.say on the streets that
Preval created a diversion to divert
the attention" from the rival can-
didates in that race, Michel said,
but he added that he doubted it
would work.
"I can predict that the people
will not forget their vote," he said.
If an acceptable second round
doesn't happen, "They will take to
the streets and demand the imme-
diate departure of Preval."
Yet another question many ask
here: Why hasn't Duvalier been
arrested, given Preval's past state-
ments that he would be prosecut-
ed for crimes against the Haitian
people if he ever returned.
Prime Minister Jean-Max
Bellerive said he is aware of the
accusations but that an arrest is
unlikely anytime soon. "We want
to be a government that respects
the law and to arrest somebody
you have to have a judiciary pro-
cess," he said.
Others are insistent. Amnesty
International, Human Rights
Watch, and the generally Aristide-
favoring Institute for Justice and
Democracy in Haiti have said

there is ample evidence and legal
action to arrest him during his
stay.
"The information available in
existing legal proceedings and
Mr. Duvalier's 25-year flight from
Haitian justice clearly justify the
immediate issuance and execution
of an arrest warrant," IJDH said in
a statement.
At the moment, at least, there
are nopending charges against the
former dictator. In fact, National
Police for a time guarded him at
the upscale Hotel Karibe before
withdrawing, leaving security to
hotel guards and a few U.N. peace-
keepers stationed outside.
Few clues came from inside the
refurbished Karibe, a new building
that was badly damaged and then
repaired after the earthquake. Old
allies of the regime in suits and
dress shirts filed into the balcony-
ringed lobby, taking the elevator to
and from Duvalier's room.
Henry Robert Sterlin, a for-
mer ambassador who said he was
speaking on behalf of Duvalier,
portrayed the 59-year-old ex-dic-
tator as merely a concerned elder
statesmen who wanted to see the
effects of the devastating Jan. 12,
2010, earthquake on his homeland.
"He was deeply hurt in his soul
after the earthquake," Sterlin said.
"He wanted to come back to see
how is the actual Haitian situation
of the people and the country."
Duvalier - who assumed power
in 1971 at age 19 following the
death of his father, Francois "Papa
Doc" Duvalier - still has some
support in Haiti and millions are
too young to remember life under
his dictatorship. But his abrupt
return Sunday still sent shock
waves through the country, with
some fearing that his presencewill
bring back the extreme polariza-
tion, and political violence, of the
past.

The kings of country

Music isn't all
about the lyrics

Decemberists turn
twangy on newest album,
'The King is Dead'
By CASSIE BALFOUR
DailyArts Writer
The earnest harmonica that opens
The Decemberists' latest album The King
Is Dead will be jar-
ring for listeners who
witnessed the band's
previous foray into
expansive prog-rock. The
This fiddle-heavy slice D - et
of rootsy Americana is
a departure for a band The King is Dead
known for its puzzling C
concept records (see
The Hazards of Love).
But The Decemberists embrace the ten-
ants of alt-country and lead singer Colin
Meloy ditches the dizzyingly literate lyrics
in favor of sparser, more straightforward
diction. The Decemberists have lightened
up, and most of The Kingls Dead is a buoy-
ant barn dance.
"Rox in the Box" sounds like it was
written in alow-lit, whiskey-saturated bar
somewhere in Appalachian back-country
with Meloy scribbling down lyrics like,
"But while we're living here / Let's get
this little one thing clear / There's plenty
of men that die." It may be darker than the

rest of the album, but has enough twangy
fiddles to rouse barflies from their bour-
bon-induced depression.
The Decemberists strive for authentic-
ity with "Calamity Song." The track is a
joyful romp that spends the first 30 sec-
onds building up tension with restrained
guitars before bursting into a full-blown,
down-home sing-along. Despite the folksy
sounds, this track has Meloy demonstrat-
ing his cultural literacy by crooning,
"Hetty Green / Queen of supply-side bon-
homie bone drab," (Google her - it just
wouldn't be a Decemberists album without
an obscure and outdated reference or two).
"January Hymn" works as a transition
between the band's penchant for melan-
choly, rich epics and the alt-country sound
that is pervasive on The King is Dead. The
track is sonically atmospheric but still has
the buttoned-up, classic feel of an Ameri-
can standard. "Rise to Me" is another suc-
cessful merging of the spectrum sounds
in which the band dabbles. The song leans
more country with its straining, moon-
lit fiddle, as Meloy sings, "Big mountain,
wide river / There's an ancient call / These
tree trunks these stream beds / Leave our
bellies full they sing out /I am gonna stand
my ground." Echoing these country trap-
pings is an eardrum-shattering harmonica
that wails in the background.
The Decemberists stumble a little with
the dull rehash "This is Why We Fight" - a
track that rumbles along without any of the
charming folksiness listeners will come to
expect from the newly twang-tinged band.

However, the one thing Decemberists fans
will miss is Meloy's grandiose storytelling.
Though the band trimmed down the songs
and infused them with a rural sensibility,
devotees might be left pining for those
overwrought epics.
But this new Decemberists release
actually finds the band scaling back on
the bells and whistles. Although listeners
may be wistful for Meloy's tall tales, this
album is filled with country-themed yarns
that are far more listenable than previ-
ously bloated concept albums. The King
is Dead is a record that conjures images
of the American heartland without any of
the cheesiness that plagues mainstream
country. This is an album that doesn't
demand too much of its listeners, but still
has a lot of soul.


I'm a big Prince fan. Recently, some-
one asked what "Purple Rain" means,
and I scoffed.
And then I thought to myself: I guess
I don't really know.
Now, I've seen the film "Purple
Rain" more than
plenty of times. I've
spent hours pouring
through demos, boot-
legs and live record-
ings. I'm excited to
find Prince cassettes,
fan magazines and
mentions in US
Weekly. Ihave about
500 songs by him, JOE
memorized maybe DIMUZIO
a hundred and con-
sistently listen to at
least 20 per week.
But "Purple Rain?" I don't listen to
it much. I never second-guess it. It's
popular, it's fun - untouchable. I can't
think of the last time I listened to it all
the way through. I don't need to. And
the lyrics?
Well, when it comes down to it, I don't
really care. Thinking about it, I've come
to realize that on the large part, with
most pop music Ilisten to, lyrics are
maybe the least important element to me.
Some people claim to be "all about the
lyrics," and I can't relate. That caveat
usually follows rap fans, which is under-
standable. But thinking about some of
my favorite rap artists and albums, the
lyrics are never the draw for me; it's
usually the whole production. Digable
Planets' Blowout Comb is one my favor-
ite albums, but I probably couldn't rap
more than a stanza of it. P.M. Dawn's
The Bliss Album...?, Nas's Illmatic and De
La Soul is Dead are others I love from
start to finish, but the lyrics are only a
part of the package.
I'm not arguing that lyrics aren't
important. They have to be taken on
their own terms. You don't listen to pop
music to hear poetry, you listen to hear
pop music. But quantifying that satis-
faction you get from listeningto lyrics,
hearing words and music and "feeling"
something is a bit harder to explain.
I'll admit to having those embar-
rassing moments of communion when
a singer seems to be writing out your
fantastic teenage romantic angst just for
you. A song comes along, some words
come out and it feels like somebody's
playing some cruel or wonderful joke on
your heart.
Over the last year, I've become a huge
disco fan. Disco's not exactly a genre
built on lyrics, but lyrics are a huge part
of what makes so many classic disco

songs work. For the genre's early days
as the music of an oppressed black,
Hispanic and gay youth, it was all about
escape. Lyrics in disco tunes can range
from a single word to anthemic, wailing
declarations of independence, romantic
visions of paradise and an aching, end-
less nostalgia for pleasure in the midst
of incredible pain.
They're another instrument, and
often, the most important one of all.
In Donald Byrd's "Love Has Come
Around" (one of my favorites), Byrd
repeats the title phrase so many times
and reverbed so coldly, you'd think he's
never been in love before. But on top of
icy, massive piano and handclaps that
sound like doors being slammed, those
words get my blood, feet and heart
pumping.
But maybe that's me investing things
into the music that aren't reallythere.
And why should that be a problem?
If we measure pop music's success
on its ability to attract and compel a
wide array of people with some simple
melodies, rhythms and words, then lyr-
ics should invite interpretations rather
than shun them. When people pour over
Beatles lyrics, with an ah-but-what-do-
they-mean complex, then they'd prob-
ably end up pretty bored. Drugs. Money.
Sex. Nothing.
The overall musical
experience is worth
a thousand words.
Whether it's Leonard Cohen or
Ke$ha, pop lyrics are more (and less)
than words. They can play a role, tell a
story or just rock the fuck out. In meta-
phor and obscenity, Ican find it all ifI
want to; no matter how poetic or con-
trived. Lyrics can be as "important" as
I want them to be, but I don't need nice
n' dry, satisfying conclusions telling me
how to think about a song.
I have at least four separate, logical
explanations for what "Purple Rain"
"means." But in the end, I don't feel
the need to waste my time with them. I
knew what it was all about the first time
I heard it. I felt it. How could the words
mean anything else?

'Hornet' falls flat in 3-D

'Lights Out' shines

*1

By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
In the recent movie "Jackass 3D," the
outright lack of 3-D imagery in all but a
few scenes was disconcerting. The produc-
ers lured us in with the
promise of glamorous
visuals for only five extra
dollars, but the delivery
was scant at best. Luck- The Green
ily, the movie still gave Hornet
us the hilarity we expect
from the "Jackass" gang At Quality 16
with uniquely painful and Rave
stunts and depraved tom-
foolery. Columbia
Even so, it raises the
suspicion that perhaps
the "3D" designation is a fallacy, consid-
ering that many of the 3-D films that have
followed "Avatar" and "How to Train Your
Dragon" don't take full (or even partial)
advantage of the resources at their dis-
posal. Unfortunately, Seth Rogen's new
adaption of "The Green Hornet" franchise
is further proof of this bait-and-switch
routine.
"The Green Hornet" could be best
described as a rip-off of the average Joe-
turned-hero element of "Kick-Ass" coupled
with the strained, affected dialogue of a
bad improv comedy bit. The characters of a
comedyshouldbejustasclosetotheiraudi-
ence as those in a compelling drama, but it
would prove an arduous (if not impossible)

task to find a single characteristic in Britt
Reid (Seth Rogen, "Pineapple Express")
or Kato (Jay Chou, "True Legend") with
which a sapient movie lover could identify.
Britt is a millionaire playboy who hates
his late father James - even in the wake
of his death - for his unwavering commit-
ment to integrity and his no-nonsense par-
enting style. In lieu of running his newly
inherited newspaper empire with the same
degree of professionalism as his father, he
decides to cause a violent stir in the under-
belly of Los Angeles to give the news some
panache.
After forging an unlikely friendship
with his father's former employee Kato,
Britt creates a clever hero disguise and
raises hell on the streets of LA with the
goal of vilifying himself and giving his
newspaper enticing fodder for reporting.
In the process, he injures cops and destroys
thousands of dollars worth of personal
property, yet we're supposed to hail him as
a hero when he later denies a bribe from a
crooked official. Case in point: Comedy can
stretch the boundaries of the believable,
but the characters' motivations should at
least have some sort of logical basis. Don't
look for it here.
Rogen's emphatic "I don't know what
the hell's going on" routine works well in
stoner flicks like "Pineapple Express" and
"Superbad," but falls flat on its face here.
He's a mediocre actor who's been fortu-
nate enough to star in plot-driven movies
that don't rely on acting chops so much as

a bevy of action scenes and slapstick situa-
tions. It brings to mind the "Family Guy"
parody of Rogen: "The Seth Rogen gene
gives you the appearance of being funny
even though you haven't actually done any-
thing funny."
Granted, the movie isn't entirely trash.
The cinematography shows some promise
with unique shots and slow-motion fight
scenes and there's an occasional good joke
("occasional" can't be stressed enough
here). But the long lag time between spo-
radic action scenes will give viewers a wel-
come opportunity to tire and yawn.

ByKAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Senior Arts Editor
FX needs to seriously consider chang-
ing its network slogan from "FX has the
movies" to "FX has the incredible origi-
nal programming featuring badass Cau-
casian men." With "The Shield," "Rescue
Me," "Sons of Anarchy"
and "Justified," the
channel's trademark **-*
is to develop dramas
with tough hombres ughtsout
for protagonists whose
mere glare would make Pilot
Don Draper pee his
pants. "Lights Out" is Tuesdays at10 p.m.
the latest addition that, FX
based on its spectacu-
lar pilot, will soon join
the pantheon of great, gritty FX dramas.
Let the boxing puns commence.
The premise of "Lights Out" is a blend
of "Breaking Bad" and "Rocky Balboa,"
and the familiarity of the plot is its only
glaring flaw. The show features Patrick
"Lights" Leary (Holt McCallany, "CSI:
Miami") a former heavyweight boxing
champion, who, in retirement, has found
himself repeatedly against the ropes.
Though Leary pretends to be content
with his life as a stay-at-home dad - and
in some ways, he is - the pilot of "Lights
Out" unearths all of Leary's regrets and
resentments in one fell swoop, bringing
the once all-powerful giant to his knees.
Poor financial investments have ripped
a hole in Leary's bank account and
gloomy medical diagnosis has left him
with an uncertain future. Add to that
the five-year anniversary of his humili-
ating final fight, and the man who once
considered himself invincible is now left
utterly neutered, unable to provide for
his family.
Like Walter White in "Breaking Bad,"
Leary is then given a golden opportu-
nity to solve all his problems - a boxing
rematch with a $10 million payout. Con-
sidering his health, familial obligations
- his wife forced him to quit in the first
place - and thirst for former glory, this
is a decision that Leary will struggle to
make, setting the stage for the rest of the
season.
McCallany's portrayal of Leary is a
total knockout and essentially the reason
why "Lights Out" brims with such tre-

mendous potential. The greatness of the
pilot involves seeing how much the char-
acterization of Leary subverts expecta-
tions. This Hulk of a man - supremely
intimidating and vicious in the boxing
ring - is shown to be a warm, caring,
endearing man outside of it.
But great shows like "Mad Men"
don't entirely explain their protagonists
immediately - layers are slowly peeled
back throughout the season. "Lights
Out" does the same, shrouding Leary in a
ring of ambiguity. Questions run amok -
it's unclear if Leary actually resents his
wife for demanding his retirement. And
most importantly, Leary's motivations
are uncertain - does he really miss the
action of his former career or is he only
considering a comeback to support his
family?
Don't come to "Lights Out" expecting
a lot of action - it's not a show about box-
ing, but about a character who used to
box. The show's violence is relegated to
sudden, short flashbacks that are tightly

mystery in town.
edited and highly effective. The main
thrills of "Lights Out" come instead from
observing Leary's interactions with his
family - the most organic since "Friday
Night Lights"-- and trying to understand
his moral code. Is Leary going to beat the
tar out of the drunken yuppie that disses
him? Or will he just walk away?
The pilot of "Lights Out" is a mag-
nificent compilation of every element
that makes great TV great. At once, it is
a character study of a fascinating has-
been, a highly entertaining hour of tele-
vision (it's funny too!) and a love letter
to a once-glorious, now mostly irrelevant
sport. In an inarguable decision, "Lights
Out" is already one of the best shows on
television.

Keeping Robinson a huge
success for Wolverines, Hoke

Michigan falls to"
OSU in "Dual"

Brady Hoke has been at
the helm of the Michigan
football program for less
than one week, but he's already
accomplished
his most impor-
tant task of the
offseason.
Yes, his 2011
recruiting class
may not be
a Michigan-
caliber class; RYAN
decommit- KARTJE
ments from
Dee Hart,
Dallas Crawford, Jake Fisher and
Matt Goudis will definitely hurt.
And yes, he won't use the
spread offense - the second time
there's been a offensive change in
the last three years.
But in that first week, he did
what Rich Rodriguez couldn't do
in his first offseason: he kept the
Wolverines' best player in Ann
Arbor.
You can't really blame Rodri-
guez for losing quarterback Ryan
Mallett to Arkansas after replac-
ing Lloyd Carr at Michigan. After
all, playing Mallett in Rodriguez's
offense would've been like fitting
a square peg in a round hole; the
guy just isn't a spread quarter-
back. But watching Mallett tear
up the SEC this year and most
likely earn himself a whole lot
of money in April's NFL Draft, it
definitely stung knowing that he
could've been tearing up the same
secondaries in the Big Ten.
With a new coaching change,
however, came a new chance at
retribution. And when it came to
keeping Denard Robinson in the
maize and blue, Hoke handily
delivered - a huge success for a
fledgling coaching staff.
Robinson - it goes without
saying now - is an otherworldly
talent. His first half of 2010 set
incredible records that no one
ever would have imagined could
be broken this season. And his
second half, though not on par
with the first, was still an admira-
ble performance against Big Ten
defenses that were eager to be the
first to stop the Amazing Denard
Robinson.
So when Athletic Director Dave
Brandon said in the press confer-

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD

It's not just the football team.
The Michigan men's track
and field team is also struggling
to earn a victory against Ohio
State. The Wolverines fell, 88-74,
in Columbus on Saturday to the
Buckeyes in "The Dual" for the
third straight time.
Although Michigan had a win-
ner in just six of the 15 events,
the decisive ones came down to
a matter of inches and fractions
of a second.
"There's a sting about it,"
Michigan coach Fred LaPlante
said after the meet. "But really, I
was actually encouraged by our
team's performance."
In the 60-meter dash, junior
Robert Peddler lost to Ohio
State's Demoye Bogle by .01 sec-
onds, causing a four-point swing.
Freshman Justin Clarke's dis-
qualification in the 200-meter.
dash cost the Wolverines anoth-
er two points. Tight finishes in a
handful of other events made the
difference in the final result of
the meet.
"If that had turned around,
the score basically would have
been even," LaPlante said. "It
wasn't like we were outclassed
or they pulled away from us. It
was a great competition. There
were a couple of instances where
our guys really rose to the occa-
sion. We didn't back down."
The beginning of the meet
wasn't short on flair. In the
first event of the day, redshirt
freshman Ethan Dennis leap-
frogged five Buckeyes to win the
35-pound weight throw. Down
six feet at one point, Dennis
threw a personal-best 65 feet
and seven and three-quarters
inches to take first place and gain
five points for the Wolverines to
kick off the rivalry matchup.
Shortly after, sophomore Jack
Greenlee pole vaulted a personal
best and meet record, 16 feet and
eight and three-quarters inch-
es. Greenlee broke the previ-
ous high in "The Dual" by eight
inches in a showdown with Ohio
State freshman Cody Marshall.
But the Buckeyes stormed
back with wins in the 400 meter,
600 meter, 800 meter and one
mile runs to put Ohio State

ahead.
"Other than those races, the
other events were very well con-
tested and we gave it our best
shot," LaPlante said. "I think our
guys will be better a few weeks
from now."
Followingthe mile, senior Carl
Buchanon set a}record for "The
Dual" in the 60-meter hurdles,
putting up a time of 7.90 seconds.
Redshirt senior Nick McCamp-
bell took second in 8.01 seconds
to give Michigan five and three
points, respectively.
"I think I've become more
aggressive," Buchanon said after
setting his personal best in the
race. "My technique is getting
more crisp in my fourth year.
This being my last season, that
has alot to do with it too."
Redshirt junior Craig Forys
also gave the Wolverines a boost,
winning the 3,000 meters by
over 15 seconds at eight minutes
and 17.62 seconds. "Track and
Field News" listed him as the top
collegiate runner in the event.
But, despite the strong indi-
vidual performances, Michigan
fell short to Ohio State in a few
crucial events.
The atmosphere for the meet
was different from what is found
in most track competitions.
With a big crowd from host Ohio
State replete with a pep band,
there was an added liveliness in
French Field House.
"Track and field usually
doesn't have this type of hoopla,"
LaPlante said. "There was a lot of
energy in that meet and our guys
stood tall and really competed."
Unlike football where the
rivalry game caps the regular
season, a loss to Ohio State in
track leaves plenty of time for
improvement.
Though the meet won't sit
well with the Wolverines, they
can take solace in that the team
has yet to peak. The athletes
train to set their best marks in
the late-season conference and
national meets, leaving plenty of
time for improvement.
"You're not fine-tuned, but
neither is the other team,"
LaPlante said. "So it's just a com-
petition of where you are at this
time in your training and your
level of competitiveness in that
situation."

Sophomore quarterback Denard Robinson finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting this season.

ence announcing Rodriguez's fir-
ing that the search wasn't "about
one particular kid on the football
team," I thought it was a poor
choice of words on Brandon's
part.
This isn't peewee football.
There's no need to worry about
player's feelings. Last season,
Denard Robinson was the Michi-
gan football team, and his team-
mates acknowledged it on many
occasions. Brandon would've been
stupid not to think of Robinson
when he was looking for Michi-
gan's next coach.
But where Brandon may have
fallen into a path of political cor-
rectness, Hoke understood almost
immediately how important Rob-
inson was to his livelihood.
Robinson loves Michigan, but
he's not stupid. If he didn't believe

he could succeed in the pro-style
offense, he would've left to play
somewhere like UCF or even
Florida where they could tailor
the offense to his strengths and
he could be close to home. But
Hoke and Borges made it their
first goal to convince Robinson to
stay. Hoke met with him privately
on his first full day in Ann Arbor,
and he clearly impressed Robin-
son with his explanations.
I've spent some time observ-
ing Robinson, his family and his
former coaches, and it's pretty
clear that all he needed from
Hoke is to be able to trust him.
Rodriguez, along with bringing
a perfect offensive scheme, was
someone who Robinson and his
family could trust tobe genuine
in his plans for Denard. Robinson
loved Rodriguez and his other

coaches, and it's safe to say that
the sophomore quarterback was
hurt when Rodriguez was axed in
Ann Arbor.
Robinson absolutely considered
a transfer. There's no doubting
that now. But after a superb meet-
ing with Hoke and Borges, it's
clear that he's convinced that he'll
be the same Denard next season.
And after his improvement from
2009 to 2010, fans can surely
expect a whole lot more of Denard
Robinson The Passer next season.
With Hoke at the helm and one
success already under his belt, I'm
growing increasingly sure that
whatever offense Michigan runs
next year should be a whole lot of
fun to watch.

Daily Sports Writer
With just under three minutes
left in the first half against Wiscon-
sin on Sunday, Michigan sophomore
guard Jenny
Ryan had the WISCONSIN 59
ball as the MICHIGAN 75
shot clock
was winding down. With no other
options, Ryan, who's not known
for her 3-point shooting ability,
was forced to fire up an NBA-range
bomb with a defender in her face.
The ball sailed through the air and
into the hoop - nothing but net.
It was one of four shot clock-
buzzer beaters that the Michigan
women's basketball team made en
route to a 75-59 victory over the vis-
iting Badgers.
"We were very lucky," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said of the
buzzer beaters. "They're very good
defensively. We just got a little bit
unglued there for awhile and wound
up a little grouped together, and
luckily we made the shots."
And although the Wolverines
may have been lucky on a couple of
possessions, luck wasn't the reason
they were successful against the
second-best defensive team in the
Big Ten.
Michigan came out firing from
the opening tip off. Junior Carmen
Reynolds led the Wolverines early,
scoring eight of the team's first 15
points as Michigan jumped out to a
15-7 lead.
"The shots were falling," Reyn-
olds said. "It comes down to my
teammates getting me open. We set
some really good screens today."
The Wolverines (3-2 Big Ten,
10-7 overall) enjoyed their biggest
lead of the half with just under six
minutes to play, as sophomore for-
ward Sam Arnold came in off the
bench and hit a 3-pointer from the
top of the key to increase the lead
to l5 points.

Michigan women's' basketball
guard Veronica Hicks should have
been tired. The senior played all
40 minutes of a hard-fought game
against a hard-nosed Wisconsin
team that did not give up an inch
defensively, scoring 21 points and
grabbing 10 rebounds.
Instead, after the game, she
bounded into the media room look-
ing like she could play another 40
minutes. All five Michigan starters
- who led an impressive 75-59 vic-
tory over the Badgers - showed a
similar stamina.
"Some of us are teenagers, some
of us are only 20 years old, so there
is no way we should go out there
and be tired," Hicks said. "(Condi-
tioning coach Joe Sanderson) tells
us all the time even his mom can
get up and down the court, so we
just need to go out there and play
basketball, because that is what we
are here to do."
Michigan (3-2 Big Ten, 10-7
overall) snapped a two-game losing

streak thanks to its starters. The
Wolverines had a total of just 15
minutes come off the bench, and 12
of those minutes came from sopho-
more forward Kate Thompson.
Wolverine starters played 93
percent of the game - a stat rarely
seen at the collegiate level. Besides
for Hicks playing the entire game,
guards Courtney Boylan and Jenny
Ryan played 38 and 33 minutes,
respectively. Even the Michigan
post players played the majority of
the game. Junior forward Carmen
Reynolds and sophomore center
Rachel Sheffer each played 37 min-
utes.
"They have to learn to be able
to play over, through, and around
pain and tiredness, and really con-
centrate," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "If you do concen-
trate, you make a lot of good things
happen"
But the Michigan starters looked
full ofenergythe entire game. They
forced nine turnovers in thesecond
half, with many coming on hustle
plays.
Tired teams often have low

3-point percentages, as shots
will fall short because of a lack of
energy from the shooter. But after
shooting 44 percent from beyond
the arc in the first half, the Wolver-
ines put away the game by shoot-
ing 50 percent from 3-point range
in the second half - a considerable
achievement given the amount of
time the starters played.
With sophomore guard Nya Jor-
dan sidelined with a knee injury,
the depth of the Wolverines was
assumed to be tested. Without Jor-
dan, who is a regular starter, Bors-
eth has relied on his starters to play
more, and so far theyhaverespond-
ed positively. The starter minutes
will likely go down upon Jordan's
return, but it is a good sign for the
team's future that its best players
have the ability to play all night.
But for now, not having to take
players like Hicks out of a game
because they're tired is a boost for
Michigan.
"I love playing basketball, and
if I get to stay in there and stay out
of foul trouble, then that's good

"We were told to be physical
with her to try and take the ball
away, and that is what we were
able to do."
In the second half, Michigan
showed few signs of letting up.
Hicks capped a 13-3 run with a
3-pointer to give the Wolverines
a commanding 19-point lead with
less than 15 minutes to play.
But just when it seemed like
the game was out of reach for the
Badgers (4-2, 9-9), they went on a
run of their own.
Sophomore guard Taylor
Wurtz caught fire, scoring all 14
of her points in the second half.
And after a bucket inside by Zas-
trow with five minutes to play,
the Michigan lead was cut to just
seven - the slimmest margin
since early in the first half.
And since the five Michigan
starters played nearly the whole
game - Hicks played all 40 min-

INDIANA
From Page 1B

Hoosiers rebounded six of their
seven missed shots in the first
half.
"Before anybody asks me the
rebounding questions - they
only missed 14 shots," Michigan
coach John Beilein said after the
game. "So there's not a whole lot
of rebounds on 14 shots. When
you have that you're never in your
transition. You're not able to do a
lot of things that you want to do."
Struggles with rebounding
caused the Wolverines to play
much more aggressively at the
glass. Late in the first half, fresh-
man guard Evan Smotrycz tallied
his third foul and walked to the
bench with his face down and his
hands on his head - another sign
that the Wolverines were frustrat-
ed in the game.
Along with Smotrycz, freshman
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. recorded
two fouls in the first stanza, as did
his backup Matt Vogrich. The foul
trouble that persisted early on

forced Michigan to fiddle around
with unconventional lineups.
"I am actually one of the guys
that think we should be cleaning
up the game," Beilein said. "We
should be calling the game close.
Several of our guys have got to
learn the hard way about that.
(Fouls) just disrupt us.
"Whether we bench them,
whether we run them, whether
we just continue to teach them -
they're young, they're forced to
find out the hard way. We couldn't
even get (Smotrycz) out of there -
it's a matter of seconds and he put
his hands on someone else."
And as the Wolverines contin-
ued to get beat on the glass and
rack in fouls, it was their shooting
that suffered as a result of such
frustration.
Michigan shot 29 percent from
3-point range and 36 percent from
the field. The Wolverines scored
15 points in the first half - their
lowest first-half total of the sea-
son and the lowest point total that
Indiana has held an opponent to
this season.
"(Defense) was the key to our

week," Indiana coach Tom Crean
said. "It was the key to all our
games ... Our players understood
that it began with what our defen-
sive transition was going to be like
because of how well they push the
ball up the court and get it up the
court."
Being out rebounded, being
in foul trouble and struggling to
make shots caused a young team
to put their heads down. Indiana
continued to pick at the souls of
the Wolverines and maintained a
comfortable lead for the final 30
minutes of play.
"I give credit to this team - we
don't really get frustrated," soph-
omore Darius Morris said after
scoring a team-high 22 points.
"We keep playing, but it is frus-
trating at the end when you look
up and you're way down. We're
keeping a good attitude when
we're out there on the court, and
then afterwards, obviously, we're
frustrated."
14 shots all game. And in fact,
the Hoosiers rebounded six of
their seven missed shots in the
first half.

it for the next five hours.
We made fun of the officer's
Midwest twang, joked about
it with a gas station employee
and pondered whether or not
we can mark off the fine as a
Daily expense.
We also drew parallels
and realized that our miser-
able start to the road trip was
awfully similar to Michigan's
play on the court lately.
Sure, that sounds likea
stretch, but stick with me -
Zak and I had a long car ride to
work this out.
For the most part, analysts
were impressed with the Wol-
verines' play againstthen-No.
3 Kansas and then-No. 2 Ohio
State last week. Few predicted
that they'd lose by such nar-
row margins - seven points
in overtime and four points,
respectively. And although
the players will tell you there's
no such thing as "moral vic-
tories," the Michigan locker
room was relatively upbeat for
a team riding a three-game
losing streak heading into
Indiana.
The Wolverines (1-4 Big
Ten, 11-7 overall) believed
they were on the cusp of get-
ting things right - if they just
persisted and continued to
keep games close, they could
win some marquee matchups.
Sure, they were still making
some freshmen mistakes -
picking up off-the-ball fouls,
forcingshots that weren't
there, not crashing the boards
on the offensive end - but if
they could still almost topple
the second- and third-best
teams in the nation, that stuff
doesn't matter, right?
Well, let's just say it matters
about as much as speeding
afterbeingpulled over and
getting a warning. You think
you can keep doing it and get
away with it, but eventually,
somebody's going to teach you
that you're dead wrong. For
Zak and I, that somebody was
the second police officer.

For Michigan, it was Indi-
ana.
In all honesty, the Wolver-
ines did not play well against
the Jayhawks. They shot just
33 percent from the field -
4-of-28 from beyond the arc
- and turned the ball over 15
times. The game was close
because Kansas played almost
as poorly, shooting 36 percent
and turning the ball over 16
times.
Michigan shot better
against Ohio State, but this
time the Wolverines picked up
foolish foul after foolish foul,
and handed the Buckeyes 25
free-throw attempts. It didn't
matter that they only con-
verted on 68 percent of them
- it's still awfully hard to win
when your opponent tallies 17
points from the charity stripe.
The game was close because of
Ohio State's questionable play
calling - for some reason, the
Buckeye guards seemed more
content shooting the ball than
taking advantage of the Jared
Sullinger-Evan Smotrycz mis-
match in the paint.
Unlike the Jayhawks or the
Buckeyes, the Hoosiers did
everything right on Saturday.
No more breaks for the Wol-
verines - no more warnings.
Indiana shot well, cleaned
up the glass and employed
the perfect balance between
guard play and post play. And a
game that was considered one
of the more winnable ones for
Michigan quickly turned into
an eye-opening 19-point loss
to a team that was previously
winless in the BigTen.
So, while Zak and I
returned to Ann Arbor with
an important lesson from two
Hoosier cops, the Wolverines
came home with the same les-
son from the Hoosier basket-
ball team.
If we don't limit our mis-
takes, we'll keep losing.
And that's a harsh reality,
both for a couple of college
kids that hate driving at the
speed limit and for a young
basketball team that commits
too many errors on the hard-
wood.

Confidence on the road

Western Michigan isn't exact-
ly a powerhouse in college ath-
letics, and tennis is no exception.
The No. 25 Michigan men's
tennis team defeated the Bron-
cos 7-0 on Sunday, marking its
eighth-straight win against its
westerly neighbors. Michigan
now leads the all-time series
52-8. And it was also the Wolver-
ines' eighth-straight win in their
season-opener.
But despite the lopsided score,
the Broncos didn't lay down to
the Wolverines - especially in
doubles play.
"It was a good effort; this is a
good Western Michigan team,"
Michigan coach Bruce Berque
said after the match. "They're
always competitive and well-
coached."
The No. 28 tandem of Michi-
gan senior captain Jason Jung
and sophomore Evan King won a
fairly routine match, 8-4, at No.1
doubles. However, in the fight for
the doubles point, the other two
matches went down to the wire.
The Wolverines' pair of fresh-
man Shaun Bernstein and sopho-
more Chris Cha eventually won
out at No. 2 doubles, 8-6, but it
took a late break to fend off the
Broncos duo of senior Kazuya
Komada and junior Zeyad Mon-
tasser. The win gave Michigan
the doubles point and an early
1-0 lead.
But Western Michigan won
at No. 3 doubles, where Michi-
gan's freshman duo of Barrett

One might expect the young Wol-

from the opening
minutes. The Wolverines allowed the
Hoosiers to shoot 67.4 percent from
the field in Michigan's worst defen-
sive performance of the season.
Indiana (1-4, 10-8) missed just 14
shots, allowing few opportunities for
Michigan to get defensive rebounds.
The Hoosiers had an enormous 37-18
advantage on the glass, and the 18
boards were a season low forBeilein's
team.
The Wolverines will have to get
their defense back on track when they
stay on the road Tuesdaynight to take
on Northwestern (2-4, 11-5) in Evan-
ston.
"We did not play great fundamen-
tal defense (against Indiana)," Beilein
said in the Big Ten coaches' telecon-
ference. "We didn't defend the ball
screensvery well.
"We've been defending, at times,
very well. (But) we were very bad at

(ball screens), and that's a huge con-
cern because the ball screen is taking
over college basketball."
The Wildcats present a tough
challenge. Coming into the season,
Northwestern was pegged as hav-
ing a solid chance to make the NCAA
Tournament for the first time in the
program's history. Theteam still has a
decent chance of doing so. The Wild-
cats faltered early on in conference
play, losing their first three confer-
ence-games, but rebounded to defeat
Indiana and Iowa before narrowly
falling at Michigan State in overtime.
Northwestern coach Bill Carmody
compared his team's and Michigan's
offensive styles on Monday, noting
their similarities in terms of spacing
the floor and taking a lot of outside
shots.
"(Beilein)'s a very good coach, and
we probably think in a similar fash-
ion," Carmody said. "You move the
ball, you move the people. If you're
open, you shoot the ball. I've admired
the way his teams have played over
the years. I'm sure I've stolen a few
things from him, and maybe he's
looked at my stuff and said, 'I can use
that.'"'
But while the Wildcats and Wol-
verines possess similar gameplans on
the offensive end of the court, the for-
mer have been executing much better
this season.
Northwestern has attempted
fewer 3-pointers than Michigan
(378 compared to 433), but has made
more - giving itedges in both 3-point
shooting percentage (39.7 percent
to 33.3 percent) and total points per
game (77.2 to 66.9). The average
makes the Wildcats the second-high-
est scoringteam in the conference.
Wildcat guard Michael Thomp-
son (15.1 points per game) and guard/
forward Drew Crawford (13.8) are

threats, but of particular concern for
the Wolverines is forward John Shur-
na. The 6-foot-8 forward is extremely
versatile on the court, capable of hit-
ting from outside and scoring down
low. Shurna is third in the Big Ten in
points per game, averaging19.3.
Michigan dropped both contests to
Northwestern last season, with Shur-
na combining for 26 points. Shurna,
who played for the gold-medal win-
ning U.S. national team in the U-19
FIBA World Championship last sum-
mer, hasalreadyexplodedfortotals of
31 and 28 points in games earlier this
season.
"He's just become such an impor-
tant player for Northwestern and
a very good player in our league,"
Beilein said. "He's more than just a
shooter ... Our hope is that guys like
(redshirt freshman forward) Blake
McLimans, guys like (freshman
forward) Evan Smotrycz can play
in a similar fashion and grow (and)
improve as much as (Shurna) has in
the time that he's been at Northwest-
ern."
Michigan followed up its first two
losses of the season in Atlantic City
by winning on the road at Clemson in
its next game. And now, the Wolver-
ines hope they can bounce back from
their new low point again on Tuesday
night, as they try to halt their slide
down the conference standings.
And Carmody has seen the same
phenomenon with his own team this
season.
"I know we played Illinois and it
was about as bad as we could play,"
Carmody said. "We came back and we
started to play a little bit better. Cer-
tainly, that's on your mind.
"Right now, I'm still concentrat-
ing on just our own team ... (but a
Michigan turnaround) certainly
concerns me."

Freshmen propel Blue past Chippewas, Boilermakers

Zeerip and Grajales
steal spotlight, help
Wolverines deliver
upset bid to Purdue
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
For the Michigan wrestling
squad, this weekend was full of
streaks, surprises and even the
chance to play spoiler.
On Friday, the 11th-ranked Wol-
verines rattled off 28 consecutive
points in their home win over
No. 21 Purdue. Then, on Sunday,
Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 6-2 over-
all) snapped a three-game losing
streak to Central Michigan, beat-
ing the 20th-ranked Chippewas
in its first match at a new home
arena.
And two freshmen - Brandon
Zeerip and Eric Grajales - stole
the show in their Big Ten debuts.
"Those two guys are going to
be a big part of our season, not
only this year, but obviously in
the future," Michigan coach Joe
McFarland said Monday. "Eric
went out there and scored a lot of
points. His conditioning is com-
ing around. Brandon keeps getting
better week to week. He broke that
kid Sunday, wore him out."
The Wolverines kicked off con-
ference play with a commanding
28-13 win over the Boilermakers.
After Purdue (0-2, 3-4-1) won
its first two matches to take a 9-0
lead, Michigan won the next seven
to put it ahead for good. It wasn't
until the meet's last match that
sophomore Mark Boyer lost, end-
ing the 28-point run.

Zeerip stepped to the mat with
a tough-act to follow, but didn't
let his teammate overshadow his
strong performance.
The freshman controlled the
match start to finish, using nine
takedowns, to earn an impressive

19-7 victory.
"After I got that win on Friday,
my confidence definitely carried

the same mentality that I have
nothing to lose, then I could do

Sophomore Hunter Collins and
13th-ranked senior captain Antho-
ny Biondo also added wins for the
Wolverines.

Michigan hopes to build ontheir
strong start to Big Ten play when
another ranked squad, Northwest-
ern, comes to Ann Arbor.
