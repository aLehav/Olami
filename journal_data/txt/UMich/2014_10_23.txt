Delay of annual
Theta Xi 'guard'
event made MSU
vandalism possible
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
For the last 14 years, the Theta
Xi fraternity has taken to Central
Campus during the week before
the Michigan State football game
to protect the sacred 'M' at the
center of the Diag from potential
East Lansingvandals.
Early Wednesday morning,
the 'M' was painted green, and
the 15th "Defend the Diag" effort
was stymied before it had even
begun. The letters "S" and "U"
were spray-painted in white
alongside theI'M' for full effect.

Theta Xi's "Defend the Diag"
initiative is currently scheduled
to start Thursday at 11 p.m. and
conclude Saturday at 8 a.m.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the Division of Public Safety
and Security, said she was sur-

prised that the fraternity was
not guarding the Diag earlier, as
the event has occurred annually
since she began working at the
University.
She said defacing the 'M' con-
stitutes malicious destruction of
property, which would qualify in
this case as a misdemeanor pun-
ishable by up to 90 days in jail
and up to a $500 fine.
As to why the Theta Xi camp-
out was slated to start so late in
the week, rumors abound about
the reason forthe delay.
University alum Tyler Bern-
stein, a former Theta X1 brother,
wrote in a Facebook comment
that a "political rally" - possibly
in reference to the candlelight
vigil protesting domestic violence
held Wednesday night - conflict-
ed with "Defend the Diag." As a
result, Bernstein wrote, the fra-
ternity wasn't able to set up shop
until Thursday night.
Current members and leaders
of the Theta Xi fraternity did not
respond to requests for comment
on the alleged issue.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
interview that the administra-
tion did not have involvement in
coordinating Theta Xi's "Defend
the Diag" event.

While frequent campus crime
alerts warn of aggressive sexual
assaults by strangers, the issue
of intimate partner violence is
common and not as easy to see,
though its effects can be just as
damaging.
Wednesday night, the Sexual

Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center held a vigil on the
Diag for those who have died as
a result of intimate partner vio-
lence. About 25 people attended
the vigil, listening to stories
about sexual assault, lighting
candles, reading a card mural
made by allies and survivors of
intimate partner violence, and
participating in a minute of
silence in honor of those who
have died. SAPAC, SafeHouse
Center and the School of Social

Work's New Visions organiza-
tion co-hosted the vigil.
LSA junior Anna Forringer-
Beal and LSA senior Katelyn
Maddock, co-coordinators for
the networking, publicity and
activism program at SAPAC,
said the vigil was meant to raise
awareness of the realities of
intimate partner violence and to
express support for survivors.

For theDaily
The International Institute
hosted a roundtable Wednes-
day exploring the multifaceted
impacts of the deadly Ebola virus
that has led to the deaths of more
than 4,500 people across several
West African countries in recent
months. The panelists discussed
the causes and consequences of
the epidemic from both a local
and global perspective.
A. Oveta Fuller, associate
professor of microbiology and
immunology and associate direc-
tor of the African Studies Center,
delivered an introduction that
touched on the nature of the
virus, its usual symptoms and
the need for better nutrition and
health care infrastructure, not
only in the countries affected by

the Ebolavirus outbreak, but also
in countries worldwide.
"This Ebola outbreak is notthe
only time that we have to work
together to coordinate health
care and that we can't wait to
work until there are epidemics
or crises like these," she said.
"We have to work in times when
there are not, to have students
prepared, people trained across
disciplines and infrastructure
prepared."
The panelists, who also
included Gesslar Murray, a geol-
ogy instructor at the University
of Liberia and Renee Gerring, a
laboratory supervisor also at the
University of Liberia, discussed
the daily effects of the outbreak
in Monrovia.
"Ebola consumes your body,"
Gerring said. "It takes control
over your life, your movements.
People are constantly in fear.
People become threats."
Gerring said people in affected
areas experience daily anxieties
from the threats posed by simple
interactions such as handshakes
and hugs. An abnormal life

U.S. airports to monitor
travelers from W. Africa

Gunman enters Canadian .
Parliament, kills soldier

Health officials
screening all those
from areas affected
by Ebola epidemic
ATLANTA (AP) - All travel-
ers who come into the U.S. from
three Ebola-stricken West Afri-
can nations will now be moni-
tored for three weeks, the latest
step by federal officials to keep
the disease from spreading into
the country.
Starting Monday, anyone
traveling from Guinea, Liberia
and Sierra Leone will have to
report in with health officials
daily and take their temperature
twice a day.
The measure applies not only
to visitors from those countries
but also returning American aid
workers, federal health employ-
ees and journalists. The Centers
for Disease Control and Preven-
H-

tion announced the new step
Wednesday.
CDC Director Tom Frieden
said monitoring will provide
an extra level of safety. Passen-
gers already get screened and
temperature checks before they
leave West Africa and again
when they arrive in the United
States.
"We have to keep our guard
up," Frieden told reporters on a
conference call.
The Obama administration
has resisted increasing pressure
to turn away any visitors from
the three countries at the cen-
ter of the Ebola outbreak, espe-
cially after a Liberian visitor
to Dallas came down with the
infectious disease days after he
arrived and later died. Instead,
passenger screening was put
in place at 5 key U.S. airports.
That was tightened Tuesday to
funnel everyone coming from
those countries through those
airports so all are checked.
5-M

The monitoring program will
start in six states - New York,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, New Jersey and Georgia
- the destination for the bulk of
the travelers from the outbreak
region. It will later extend to
other states.
Each passenger will be
required to provide contact
information for themselves as
well as a friend or relative. They
will be instructed to check for
a fever twice a day and report
their temperature and any
symptoms to health officials
daily for 21 days.
How the checks are done -
in person, by phone or Skype
- will be decided by the states,
Frieden said. If a traveler does
not report in, public health offi-
cials can track them down. How
far they can go to get them to
cooperate is up to those officials,
CDC officials said.
They will also receive "CARE"
kits - the name stands for
Check and Report Ebola. The
kits include a thermometer and
instructions on what to do if
symptoms occur. Also included
is a card to present to health care
providers if they seek care.
CDC already was telling its
own employees and other health
professionals returning from the
outbreak zone to monitor their
temperature. It can take up to 21
days to develop symptoms, which
include fever, headache, muscle
aches, vomiting and diarrhea.
Earlier this year, roughly 150
travelers to the U.S. each day
were from the three countries.
But it appears there are far fewer
now - there are no direct flights
and flights to the area have been
curtailed. New York's Kennedy
airport - which handles the
most traffic - has averaged 34 a
day since screening began Oct. 11.
The other airports are Wash-
ington's Dulles, Newark's Liber-
ty, Chicago's O'Hare andAtlanta's
Hartsfield-Jackson. While a few
of the people screened thus far
have been taken to the hospital,
none had the infectious disease.

Guard shoots down
attacker after he
fatally wounded
Canadian corporal
OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) - A
masked gunman killed a sol-
dier standing guard at Canada's
war memorial Wednesday, then
stormed Parliament in an attack
that was stopped cold when
he was shot to death by the
ceremonial sergeant-at-arms.
Canada's prime minister called
it the country's second terrorist
attack in three days.
"We will not be intimidated.
Canada will never be intimi-
dated," Prime Minister Stephen
Harper vowed in an address to
the nation.
Unfolding just before 10 a.m.,
while lawmakers were meet-
ing in caucus rooms, the assault
rocked Parliament over and
over with the boom of gunfire,
led MPs to barricade doors with
chairs and sent people stream-
ing from the building in fear.
Harper was addressing a caucus
when the attack began outside
the door, but he safely escaped.
Investigators offered little
information about the gunman,
identified as 32-year-old petty
criminal Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.
But Harper said: "In the days
to come we will learn about the
terrorist and any accomplices
he may have had."
A government official told AP
that Zehaf-Bibeau was a recent
convert to Islam. The official
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because the person was not
authorized to discuss the case
publicly.
Canada was already on alert
because of a deadly hit-and-
run assault Monday against
two Canadian soldiers by a
man Harper described as an
"ISIL-inspired terrorist." ISIL,
or Islamic State, has called for
reprisals against Canada and
other Western countries that
have joined the U.S.-led- air

campaign against the extremist
group in Iraq and Syria.
Witnesses said the soldier
posted at the National War
Memorial, identified as Cpl.
Nathan Cirillo, was gunned
down at point-blank range by a
man carrying a rifle and dressed
all in black, his face half-cov-
ered with a scarf. The gunman
appeared to raise his arms in
triumph, then entered Parlia-
ment, a few hundred yards away,
where dozens of shots soon rang
out, according to witnesses.
People fled the complex by
scrambling down scaffold-
ing erected for renovations,
while others took cover inside
as police with rifles and body
armor took up positions outside
and cordoned off the normally
bustling streets around Parlia-
ment.
On Twitter, Canada's justice
minister and other government
officials credited 58-year-old
sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers
with shooting the attacker just
outside the MPs' caucus rooms.
Vickers serves a largely ceremo-
nial role at the House of Com-
mons, carrying a scepter and
wearing rich green robes, white
gloves and atall imperial hat.
At least three people were
treated for minor injuries.
In Washington, President
Barack Obama- condemned
the shootings as "outrageous"
and said: "We have to remain
vigilant." The U.S. Embassy in
Ottawa was locked down as a
precaution, and security was
tightened at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier at Arlington
National Cemetery just outside
Washington.
Harper vowed that the
attacks will "lead us to strength-
en our resolve and redouble our
efforts" to keep the country safe
and work with Canada's allies to
fight terrorists.
Police said in the initial hours
that as many as two other gun-
men may have taken part in the
attacks. But by late in the eve-
ning, the cordon around Parlia-
ment was lifted and police said

there was no longer any threat
to the public in the area.
Court records that appear
to be the gunman's show that
he had a long rap sheet, with a
string of convictions for assault,
robbery, drug and weapons
offenses, and other crimes.
Tony Zobl said he witnessed
the Canadian soldier being
gunned down from his fourth-
floor window directly above
the National War Memorial, a
70-foot, arched granite ceno-
taph, or tomb, with bronze
sculptures commemorating
World War I.
"I looked out the window and
saw a shooter, a man dressed all
in black with a kerchief over his
nose and mouth and something
over his head as well, holding
a rifle and shooting an honor
guard in front of the cenotaph
point-blank, twice," Zobl told
the Canadian Press news agen-
cy. "The honor guard dropped
to the ground, and the shooter
kind of raised his arms in tri-
umph holding the rifle."
The Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. had video of the gun-
man going to his car alone with
his weapon after the shooting
at the memorial. The car was
later spotted parked in front of
Parliament Hill, just down the
block.
Cabinet minister Tony Clem-
ent tweeted that at least 30
shots were heard inside Parlia-
ment, where Conservative and
Liberal MPs were holding their
weekly caucus meetings.
"I'm safe locked in a office
awaiting security," Kyle See-
back, another member of Parlia-
ment, tweeted.
"I was just taking off my jack-
et to go into caucus. I hear this
pop, pop, pop. Possibly 10 shots,
don't really know. Thought it
was dynamite or construction
rather than anything else," said
John McKay, a member of Par-
liament.
He said security guards then
came rushing down the halls,
herding them toward the back
of the buildings.

UHS health survey, part 2
Survey reveals a decline in contraceptive use
n Oct. 15, University Health Service published its
results from the National Health Assessment Survey,
a study that looks at general health indicators of the
student body. The results of this survey provide a useful tool for
identifying positive and negative health trends among University
students. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board has isolated three
main topics for analysis: Alcohol and drug abuse, mental health
and sexual health and relationships. This editorial focuses on the
sexual health of the student population.

to college and to obtain a degree.
Their persistence and struggle will
supposedly guarantee success and
a better life, but in reality, they risk
becoming ensnared in debt with
poor health and little motivation.

The purpose of student loans is to
provide aid to determined individu-
als seeking education, but unless
there's a major tuition reform or the
creation of more options to guar-
antee aid, loans will more often

offer stagnation and further hard-
ship instead of opportunity for
underprivileged students.

dentity is an amorphous con-
cept. I mentioned Bruni and
Brooks of The New York Times
in my last piece,
and identity is a
topic they both
address. Both
agree that college
is supposed to
develop "identity"
in some sense,
though neither ELI
know exactly ELI
what that means.
Nor do they know
how that mani-
fests itself. I suppose, in some ways,
that's the point - were it specific,
discrete, concrete, then we probably
would have already had to memorize
it in said aforementioned Psych class.
Nonetheless, it seems our mandate,
for the duration of time we spend at
school, is to develop (our) identity.
It's a nice thought. However, itcan
also be incredibly painful.
This pain has materialized itself
across the country in malicious
ways, through campus shootings,
sexual assault and suicide. These
aren't the actions of confident, self-
aware students. They are the out-
ward demonstrations of internalized
pain - whether towards girls (ref-
erence the University of California,
Santa Barbara shooting), boys (the
relationship between sexual inad-
equacy, chauvinism and rape have
proven perilous at Columbia Uni-
versity) or schoolwork (a suicide at
my high school was directly caused
by a Latin class). It has also come
to fore in the forms of increasing
usage rates of alcohol, drugs and
psychotropic medication.
I came across a 2013 study
recently that showed the negative
correlations between "identity devel-
opment" and anxiety/depression in
10,000 undergraduates across the
country. The same study showed that
identity development contributed
to such beneficial long-term quali-
ties as "internal meaning" and "self-
esteem." So it does seem that there is

hinking CAl
natural tension between the short-
term challenges and long-term devel-
opment. But clearly, this tension has
amplified in recent years - undoubt-
edly caused in part by ever growing
application volumes (and by proxy,
competition) into secondary educa-
tion programs (medical schools, for
example, received the most applica-
tions in their history last cycle).
The study states that nation-
ally, 15.4 percent of undergradu-
ates reported being diagnosed with
depression. This is not a surpris-
ingly high figure. University Health
Service released a report recently
that surveyed 3,351 Michigan stu-
dents in February 2014 demonstrat-
ing similar numbers. The report
further shows that 26.2 percent of
students reported that stress was an
"impediment" to academic perfor-
mance, and 19 percent reported that
"anxiety" was similarly disruptive.
So, the psychological impact of iden-
tity development through school hits
close to home. Frequent emergency
alerts regarding campus violence,
Sumana Palle's account (published in
the Daily two weeks ago) and former
Michigan kicker Brendan Gibbons'
case all parallel national crises.
Thus, these issues clearly abound
our hallways. Undoubtedly we've
all faced our own personal bouts
with anxiety and stress, inside and
outside of the classroom. These are
challenges I've confronted numer-
ous times, through varied feelings
of incessant inadequacy, debilitat-
ing insecurity and unrelenting sad-
ness. I've feltthesethe moment I was
rejected from a fraternity freshman
year. I've felt these the moment I got
my MCAT back. I've felt these, most
recently, the moment a relationship
with someone I care about tremen-
dously took a turn for the worse.
Loneliness and helplessness in the
age of social media can be deadly,
traumatizing pathogens. In these
moments, itcan seem that all you can
do is turn to yourself and ask: "How
do I, how can I, keep going?" These
moments are the most devastating,

the most isolating, the most danger-
ous. Butcthey shouldn't have to be.
Psychological care on campus
ought to help students persevere
through those moments. As identity
is deemed the fundamental outcome
of the educational institution, these
moments of anguish are (statisti-
cally) inevitable. Luckily, in my time
of need, I had friends, family and
a therapist I felt comfortable turn-
ing to. Not all may be so lucky in the
moment they need it most.
This is where the University's
Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vicescomesin. CAPShasdonewellto
recognize the campus mental health
epidemic(s), raise awareness of such
looming issues, and revamp some of
their protocols. The one thing that
CAPS cannot control is the undeni-
able,untraceable stigmasurrounding
making use of its services. And for
that, I implore you to take yourself
seriously enough to see them when
you need support. Just as you would
(and undoubtedly have) trudged over
to UHS when you had the flu, feel
compelled to do the same when you
feel emotionally helpless. Emotions
have been proven extremely pow-
erful things (for positive and nega-
tive) over and over - whether it be
through the aforementioned crises,
or inthe simple factthatsymptomsof
chronic diabetes improved15 percent
innon-depressed patients (analogous
results have been shown with many
other conditions). As such, do not
take yours lightly.
Care enough about your ownwell-
being to take the time to find relief
when you are in pain. If you feel bro-
ken, let someone help you find the
pieces to put yourself together again
- whatever you do, don't give up on
your personal puzzle. Don't try to
avoid the inevitable - try to prepare
for it. So be smart. Put on your think-
ing caps. The future you, whoever
they are, however they end up, when-
ever they appear, will thank you.

Iam Urdu

In our younger years, my older brother and
I enjoyed drastically different pursuits. I
loved school, but my brother detested it.
While my predilection for
books led me to bury my
head within pages and con-
coct story ideas, my broth-
er's entrepreneurial mind
devised business plans and
ways to diversify his sav-
ings (which usually meant
hiding money in numerous
crannies I couldn't reach). MELISSA
While I pranced about his SCHLOKE
room shoving my report
cards in his face, he'd sit
there fanning himself
with the cash he earned from his paychecks.
We - like many other siblings - thrived upon
light-hearted antagonism. Therefore, "nerd,"
"loser" and "bookworm" soon became his pre-
ferred names for me. Likewise, I'd continually
flap my arms in his presence, chanting that
"all the little birdies flying over his shoulder
chirped 'cheap, cheap, cheap.' "
Over time as we both matured and when
he finished college, I realized my brother's
concern about money wasn't a sign of greed.
Especially after I grasped the fact my desire
to continue in academia would require sub-
mergence in a sea of student-loan debt, I
realized why my brother spent years storing
money away in various caches he referred to
as "funds." I understood why he spent so many
summers working all day, only to come home
exhausted and to tell me to leave him alone
and let him sleep. Just as Iviewed good grades,
books and extracurriculars as an avenue to a
life I would enjoy, he saw money as a way to
ensure financial security and a better life. As
I utilize some of his old tactics to figure out
my loan totals each year, I begin to think he
just wanted to avoid the nauseating apprehen-
sion I feel swirling in my gut each time I newly
* calculate the obscene amount of debt I'll owe
after graduation. I could see why he'd try so
hard to avoid that anxiety.
I had absolutely no clue about social mobil-
ity as a child. I wouldn't have understood mov-

ing up in socio-economic class was what my
brother intended to do with his savings and his
degree. Sadly, as I make progress towards grad-
uation, the concept of social mobility seems
more and more like atwisted fairy tale. Costs of
college tuition have increased by approximate-
ly 1,122 percent since 1978. Medical costs have
only increased by roughly 600 percent in that
same time period. Currently, student-loan debt
at the national level has reached roughly $1.2
trillion. For college students from lower socio-
economic backgrounds, student loans - as well
as the accompanying debt - aren't merely an
option, they're an absolute necessity. Pelligrants
- which were specifically intended to assist
students from low-income backgrounds - are
now covering the smallest fragment of college
tuition costs since they were first implemented.
Student loans pose an obvious impediment
to social mobility for poorer students. How-
ever, the drawbacks of this particular debt
are not solely financial. In a Gallup poll, it was
found that individuals who accrue more than
$50,000 in debt after graduation tend to expe-
rience difficulty in other aspects of their lives
as well. Individuals embarking on post-grad
life burdenedby debt often experience a lack of
purpose and a lack of community in their lives.
They don't feel motivated to achieve goals. They
don't enjoy their work or where they live, and
they don't feel safe in the communities where
they reside.
Loan debt creates anxiety-inducing situa-
tions, but there are other ways in which debt
weakens the health of college grads. In the
Gallup poll, the individuals surveyed reported
experiencing declines in physical health. High
levels of debt are correlated with the likelihood
of experiencing anxiety, depression and sui-
cidal thoughts. Likewise, owing overwhelm-
ing amounts of debt is correlated to high blood
pressure, which can lead to the development
of other ailments such as stroke or hyperten-
sion. Considering many graduates who take out
loans are from poorer backgrounds, the inabil-
ity to afford proper medical care is yet another
factor placing their health at risk.
Individuals from poorer backgrounds are
consistently told to work hard in order to go
I

T he yoke of arms is
shaken off more readily
by subject peoples

Lorenzo Valla
Four years ago,
when my grandfa-
ther was hospital- Y
ized in the days
leading up to his
passing, he under-
went surgery. Part MAHMOOD
of the procedure
involved having
a tube put down
his throat. When he woke up, two of
my older cousins, both of whom had
grown up in Pakistan and both of
whom were doctors, asked him how
he was doing. He opened his mouth
but pain forced it to close, and he
resorted to the pen and paper he was
handed. His trembling, bony fingers,
stained with the liver spots of old age,
spelled out as elegant a note as he
could and handed it to his grandchil-
dren. "My throat hurts." My cousins
looked twice at the Urdu letters, sud-
denly so foreign, and shrugged. They
asked my grandpa to write down his
message again in English. It might
really have been the last thing he
ever wrote.
Once upon a time, if you hailed a
rickshaw in Lucknow, India, your
driver would welcome you with a
couplet in Urdu, a gem for you to
behold on your ride. But no more.
I have always been unable, for
some reason, to behold my language
without mourning inside. I feel Urdu
is dying. I'm part of the Linguistics
Club here at the University. In Feb-
ruary, I came across a link posted on
the group's Facebook page around
St. Patrick's Day. A man named Man-
chan Magan had created a TV series
out of a social experiment in which
he refused to speak anything but
Irish in Ireland. For me, this was
confirmation that I was not the only
crazy person yelling about the death
of his native language.
The most poignant scene for me
was one of desperation. Manchan
decided to stand up in the center of a

town square, surrounded by throngs
of busy shoppers in open sunshine,
and literally beg the people of Dub-
lin to produce a single person who
could speak Irish with him. A crowd
of about 20 people gathered loosely
around, keeping a safe distance.
They considered him from afar with
disapproving looks, as if he were
crazy for speaking Irish in Ireland.
There were the tourists who had no
idea that there was even a language
called Irish, and Irish to them had
always been a drunken kind of Brit-
ish accent. Indeed, not a single per-
son among all the hundreds could
come forward even when Manchan
begged anyone for even a single
word in Irish, even when he pulled
out money, a fistful of notes for a
word of Irish in the heart of Dublin.
No one. Not a word. Manchan bowed
his head in defeat and walked away.
In a comment beneath the video
of this first episode, someone had
voiced this almost unique judgment
of mine:
I don't consider people who don't
speak Irish to be Irish. They are vic-
tims ofcolonialism and nothing else.
The same way, I have said for the
longest time that 'Urdu-speakers'
who speak only English are nothing
but English. In this way, the ques-
tion of why I am so attached to Urdu
is answered with a more perplexing
question. I see language as identity.
I am Urdu. -
And I am, neurologically. As we
grow up in a language, it is hardly
too poetic to imagine that as our
brains grow and neurons form new
connections, that these connections
develop along the grammar and logic
of our native tongues. What if every
native Urdu speaker has an indelible
fingerprintof sorts of neural connec-
tions that he shares with other Urdu
speakers? This fingerprint cannot
be taught. It must come from being
a true part of a community, a legacy
that is its native language.
Here in America, we no longer
hear the tongues that once echoed
in the.Appalachians and the Rockies,
which rippled across the waters of
Michigan. I once met with the Ojib-

wa teacher here, an aged gentleman
named Alphonse Pitawanakwat. I
asked him to say something in his
language for me, and he obliged. I
reveled in the words I heard. Those
words belonged here, and I feltI was
privy to an ancient secret. I wonder
how many more will ever know it.
Our Spirits Don't Speak English is
a 2008 documentary that shares the
story of those whose native tongues
were metaphorically ripped out
of their mouths. One elderly man
with silver pigtails and a hardened,
proud face gives his name as Andrew
Windyboy. When he was younger,
he was sent to two boarding schools
where he was punished for speaking
his native language.
"It was my first language. I didn't
know any other language. So when-
ever I talked, it came out. Cree would
come out, and whenever I talked I'd
get hit. I got hit so much ... I lost my
tongue ... I lost my native tongue."
He twists his neck in the suffer-
ing that he could not escape, his soul
torn, his words falling from his lips.
His words hate themselves, touched
so cruelly by the accent of his fore-
fathers. I watch a proud Chippewa
Cree break down in tears before me,
and I have to fight back my own.
"The only thing I remember is
my Indian name. It means Old Man
Eagle. It's the only CreeI know."
My grandpa was Urdu. He was
the true inheritor of a vast treasure.
A language that has its roots in the
mother of all Europe's languages,
Sanskrit. A language that carried
on the shoulders of great caravans
the stories of so many pilgrims and
empires. It carries yet the Vedic tra-
dition, the Hebrew tradition, the
Persian tradition. It's an orchard
whose pomegranates and guavas
ripened over thousands of years, a
winery whose stores were as aged as
the Himalayas.
I write this essay in English. But
my spirit will never speak English.
My grandpa was Urdu. My father is
Urdu. I will be Urdu.

"Theta Xi decided on their own
to guard the block M overnight
just Thursday and Friday nights
this year," he wrote.
He said he was aware of other
evening events on the Diag this
weekas well, includinga pep rally
Thursday night for the Michigan
State game.
Workers came to clean off the

'M' and surrounding brick at
about 10 a.m.Wednesday. Fitzger-
ald said cleaning and repairs to
the 'M' are done from time to
time, and procedures are in place
to do so when necessary.
In the past, Theta Xi has suc-
cessfully defended the block 'M'
in the week leading up to the
annual rivalry game. Additional-
ly, the University hasn't been the
only victim, the Spartan statue
having been painted maize and
blue last year.

pening on a college 'campus,"
Forringer-Beal said. "But we
hope that people realize that it
does. And even if it's not happen-
ing right here and now, there are
a lot of people on campus whose
lives have been affected by it,
whether it was their parents or
friends."
Maddock said SAPAC uses the
specific term "intimate partner
violence" as opposed to "domestic
violence" to signal that this type
of violence can happen between
people who do not cohabitate. It
can happen after a first date or
after years of a relationship. For-
ringer-Beal stressed that intimate
partner violence can be physical,
emotional and sexual.
A new component of the vigil
this year was a card mural deco-
rated either with hands and
hearts or T-shirts. Allies deco-
rated and wrote messages of sup-
port on the hand-and-heart cards,
while survivors did the same
with the T-shirt cards. Messages
included "I believe in you. It's not

your fault" and "You are loved."
"We hope having all of these
cards is a powerful representa-
tion of people on campus who
have been affected by violence or
people who know someone who's
been affected by this," Maddock
said. "This isn't an issue that is
absent from our campus - it's
something that happens every-
where and almostevery minute of
the day."
Accordingto the Center for Dis-
ease Control, one in four women
and one in seven men have gone
through severe intimate partner
violence intheir lifetimes.
Before the minute of silence,
Forringer-Beal and Maddock
shared stories and statistics relat-
ing to intimate partner violence.
Forringer-Beal told the story of
Tamara Williams, an LSA senior
in 1997 who was stabbed to death
by her boyfriend on North Cam-
pus.
"To all the students, the ladies,
the men, I just want to say, just be
careful, take care of yourselves ...
if you have a problem, tell some-
body. Tell your mother. Tell your
father. Tell somebody," Williams'
mother said in a memorial lecture
in 2003.

TUITION
From Page 1A
increases since the initial cut.
Snyder said during a confer-
ence call with college newspa-
pers last week that the tuition
increase caps have been success-
ful, and that he wants to help uni-
versities reduce their costs going
forward. In addition, the Presi-
dents Council, State Universities
of Michigan has also not found
the caps to be too burdensome on
university operations.
"Do we like them? No. We
think it really undermines our
autonomy, but we've accepted
them because they've been rea-
sonable in relationship to growth
in state appropriations," said
PCSUM Executive Director
Michael Boulus.
With the exception of Wayne
State University's 8.9-percent
tuition increase last year, all state
universities have complied with
the cap since it was instituted.
University of Michigan officials
and policy analysts have not
viewed the cap as particularly
burdensome on operations.
The law still allows for schools
to raise tuition and the pen-
alty for exceeding the cap is not
severe. Penalties would come in
the form of eliminating schools'

performance funding. Of the
state's $1.4 billion outlay for
higher education, $74.6 million,
or roughlySpercent,goestoward
performance funding. For Wayne
State, the consequence of raising
tuition above the cap last year
was a reduction of $534,700 from
their $183 million allocation from
the state.
Still, the state's attempt to
reign in tuition costs as its own
contributions to universities
have declined could be more con-
sequential should current fiscal
trends continue. The proportion
of state funds and tuition dollars
in the University's budget has
almost fully reversed. In 1960,
state appropriations accounted
for 78 percent of the University's
general fund; today, the state
contributes just 16 percent to that
budget, while tuition revenues
represent 71 percent of it.
The exploding cost oftuition is
a direct result of this significant
decline in state support. Due to
the state's reduced role and the
fact that the cost of attendance
is becoming unaffordable for a
growing number of students,
according to Boulus, financial
aid now occupies a greater share
of universities' operating bud-
gets. Some fear that a cap on
tuition increases could inhibit
the University's ability to provide

financial aid, but it has managed
double-digit percentage increas-
es in the financial aid budget for
nine of the past 10 years. The
largest percentage increases
have occurred in the past two
years - at 13.7 and 13.4 percent,
respectively - even as the cap
on tuition increases has become
more restrictive.
"For the last several years
we've increased financial aid at
a rate that for the students who
have the highest financial need,
they're essentially shielded from
the increase in tuition," said Cyn-
thia Wilbanks, University vice
president for government rela-
tions.
The' Snyder administration
was not the first to introduce
tuition restraint into its budget
language. Former Democratic
Governor Jennifer Granholm's
first budget in 2003 specified an
intent to keep tuition increases
"reasonable." Then in 2004, the
state provided additional funding
to universities that did not adopt
a tuition increase, and the follow-
ing year implemented a 2.4-per-
cent cap on tuition raises tied
to the provision of a small por-
tion of state appropriations. In
2006 and 2007, the state budget
required that universities match
its increase in resident under-
graduate tuition with an equal

percentage increase in its general
fund financial aid expenditures.
While Michigan's state uni-
versities have not had a problem
with the tuition conditions so
far, Boulus warned that could
change.
"If it gets out of line and the
tuition restraint doesn't mesh
well with whatever increase or
decrease we receive from the
state, there will be a pushback,"
he said.
The issue of tuition caps has
not explicitly been raised in the
context of the governor's race,
but Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Mark Schauer has
repeatedly criticized Snyder for
his initial 15-percent cut in 2011,
and has vowed to restore the
budget to pre-2011 levels.
"Marksupports caps on tuition
increases as one tool to make
college more affordable for the
middle class," said Cathy Bacile
Cunningham, Schauer's press
secretary. "However, he believes
the best way to make college more
affordable is to reverse Governor
Snyder's cuts to our colleges and
universities, while increasing
need-based financial aid. Mark's
jobs plan also calls for establish-
ing a student loan refinancing
authority, which would allow
students to refinance their college
loans at more affordable rates."
"I believe the current tax system
is unfair to Michigan families and
businesses," Land said in an inter-
view last week with the Lansing
State Journal."We need reformthat
makes taxes lower, fairer and sim-
pler for families and businesses."
The Michigan First Plan
includes a proposal that would
ultimately reduce the corporate
tax rate, allowing for small busi-
nesses to more easily invest and
thrive in Michigan.
5.When it comes to media,
she's playing it safe
Known for her reserved cam-
paigning style, Land has avoided
media interviews and press con-
ferences. While she is sometimes
known to bring along reporters
during public meetings and inter-
actions with citizens, Land has
kept media representatives out of
the loop for several of her public
events.


LAND
From Page 1A
1. Despite criticism, Land
hopes to win the women's vote
Land's campaign advertisement
from earlier this year mocked
claims that she was waging a war
against women's rights as she sup-
ports wage equity among genders
and is an abortion opponent.
"As a woman, I might know
a little bit more about women
than Gary Peters," she said in her
advertisement from earlier this

MICHIGAN DALY.COM

year, titled "Really?"
On her website, Land calls her-
self a "strong supporter" of equal
pay for women and men and
greater workplace equity. Land
also says she opposes govern-
ment funding for abortions.
2. She's opposed to the
Affordable Care Act
Known for criticizing President
Barack Obama's and Peters' views
on health care, Land called Obam-
acare a "string of broken prom-
ises and a disaster for thousands
of Michigan families" earlier this
month in an interview with the
Lansing State Journal. She recom-
mends overhauling the recently
implemented health care reform
for a more free-market approach
to health care accessibility.
Through her Michigan First
Plan, a comprehensive platform
that proposes policy changes to
strengthen Michigan's economy,

Land includes amendments that
she says would increase patients'
autonomy over their health care
choices - ultimately increasing
transparency and mobility in
coverage and decreasing costs.
3. She supports hans on same-
sex marriage
When asked about her views
on same-sex marriage, Land
said she supported the notion of
a "traditional marriage between
a man and a woman," MLive
reported in March.
4. She's backing smallbusiness
Much of Land's early, child-
hood was spent working at her
family's motel business. She has
been propagating simpler IRS
processes, which she hopes will
ease the burden on small business
owners to allow them to spend
more time with their families.

EBOLA
From Page 1A
cycle evolves as the community
becomes paranoid, depression
sets in and a lack of trust between
people develops. In Liberia,
where an increasing numbers of
hospitals and schools are closing,
a lack of awareness and overbur-
dened public health systems have
led to a spiral of negative conse-
quences, as people have died of
curable diseases such as the flu
and complicated pregnancies.
Given the progression of the
disease in West Africa, public
health centers and hospitals have
become stigmatized as a last
resort for those infected with
Ebola - many view admission
to local hospitals essentially as
a death sentence. The panelists
said it is important not only to
improve health care infrastruc-
ture but also to build trust among
the public in affected regions so
infected individuals can feel con-
fident about their health care if
admitted.
This discussion included Asso-
ciate Anthropology Prof. Michael
McGovern, a political anthro-
pologist who has spent a large
amount of time in West Africa.
He said there is currently an

abundance of preventive knowl-
edge in the West African commu-
nity and emphasized the need for
leveragingthis knowledge in con-
junction with international pub-
lic health knowledge to increase
our understanding of the Ebola
virus and minimize its outbreak.
Adam Lauring, assistant pro-
fessor of internal medicine and an
expert in infectious diseases and
virology, said the Ebola virus has
a high mutation rate, meaning that
it can quickly evolve to take other
forms. However, researchsuggests
that as the virus mutates - poten-
tially to an airborne form - it
would likely becomoe less virulent
andpotentiallypose alower risk.
In the Human Development
Index, which ranks countries
and territories based on health,
education and quality of life mea-
sures, Liberia- one ofthenations
most affected by the outbreak -
falls under the "low human devel-
opment" category and is placed
175th out of 187 countries.
Gesslar saidthe cities are over-
congested and health care infra-
structure is very much neglected.
At times like these, people are far
more likely to die from causes
other than Ebola.
However, the panelists said
there is currently an unwar-
ranted stigma surrounding the

disease, noting that Ebola is nat-
urally occurring and can affect
anyone who has contact with
the virus, not just individuals in
underdeveloped countries.
The panelists also discussed
how Ebola can be contained. Pre-
ventive measures such as isola-
tion of suspected patients can
help stop its transmission. Fuller
also said better nutrition, hygiene
and awareness can lead to long-
term health benefits.
In addition, public health pro-
fessionals are working with reli-
gious leaders in Liberia to help
establish safe burial practices
that account for both religious
traditions and worker safety, as
Ebola becomes more contagious
after an individual dies from the
disease.
"My hope is that the Liberian
government invest more in pub-
lic health and empower health
workers," Gerring said.
The panelists concluded by
discussing how the Ebola virus
should encourage the United
States to improve health care
infrastructure and how it is the
responsibility of everyone to
educate themselves and spread
awareness.
"When one country sneezes
another country catches the
cold," Murray said.

Freshmen expected to contribute

CROSS COUNTRY
Programs' past,
futures linked

By KELLY HALL
Daily Sports Writer
For both Michigan basketball
teams, success seems to come in
fives.
Though Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico won't be starting
all five freshmen like Steve
Fisher did with his Fab Five in
1991, she's hoping that all five of
her first-year players - coming
from a recruiting class that
was ranked 22nd in the nation
by All Star Girls Report - will
contribute meaningful minutes
this season.
Perhaps the most touted
recruit for the Wolverines is
5-foot-7 point guard Katelynn
Flaherty. The freshman makes
up for her small frame with her
shooting ability and basketball
IQ. She comes from a family of
basketball players - both of her
parents played in college - and
scored more than 2,000 points
in high school before being
sidelined her senior year with an
ankle injury.
"(Flaherty) is a true scorer,"
Barnes Arico said. "I think the
physical part of it ... is going to be
an adjustment for her, because
she's small, and she's thin, and
she's not as strong as she needs
to be yet, but she's very crafty
with the ball in her hands."
Jillian Dunston is also
having an uncommonly smooth
transition to college ball. The
forward was the first member of
the freshman class to commit,
and the early decision has paid
off.
"Jillian Dunston has come
in and done a tremendous job,"
Barnes Arico said. "She's big,
she's strong and she's physical.
The transition for her really
hasn't been that difficult
because she has the size and the
explosiveness as a lot of college
athletes already."
Dunston has been rotating
with senior captain Nicole

Elmblad at the '3' and '4' spots
during practice. Dunston, like
Elmblad, is 5-foot-11.
On paper, it appears Michigan
lacks size, but 6-foot-4 freshman
center Terra Stapleton could be
the solution the Wolverines are
looking for.
Coming from a small town in
Ohio, Stapleton had more than
just basketball to acclimate to
this summer. After working
with nutritionists, strength
and conditioning coaches, and
attending summer classes for
all of July and half of August,
Stapleton, along with the other
freshmen, are starting to see the
advances needed to compete at
the collegiate level.
Rounding out the group are
freshmen from opposite sides

of the country: forward Emoni
Jackson from Los Angeles and
guard Maria Backman from
the Bronx. And their talent,
combined with that of the other
three, has the veterans excited.
"In our last couple practices,
they've really started to click
and figure things out," Elmblad
said. "They're a really talented
group and I'm excited to see
what they're going to do for us
on the court this year. They have
a lot of potential to help us out."
SomeoftheadvancesElmblad
mentioned are due to Barnes
Arico's tough conditioning
workouts. The third-year coach
is known for her emphasis on
fitness and endurance. After a
quiet sophomore year, forward
Cyesha Goree lost 20 pounds to

become an essential component
of last season's success. Some
of the freshmen, including
Stapleton, have already seen
similar results.
"We really wantto be in shape
and be able to run up and down
the court," Elmblad said. "It's
cool to see how they went from
our first practices in the summer
that were only an hour to see
where they are now, practicing
for two or three hours. They're
doing a lot better."
The freshmen have come a
long way from their first jittery
practice together. Before the
season has even commenced, the
Wolverines are hoping for a long
tournament run together. The
talented freshman class makes
that more of a possibility.

By NATHANIEL CLARK
Daily Sports Writer
It has been a banner year for
Michigan cross country.
The women's team is ranked
No. 4 in the nation and has two
team titles, one at the Big Ten
Preview on Sept.20 and another
at the Coast-to-Coast Battle in
Beantown on Sept. 26. The men's
squad checks in at No. 14, with
victories at the Big Ten Preview
as well as at the Blue and Gold
Invitational on Oct. 3.
For the women, success
was expected. The Wolverines
entered the season atop the
rankings and most ofthe runners
are returning members of a team
that placed fourth at the NCAA
Championships in 2013.
Sophomore Erin Finn and
senior Brooke Handler have
become familiar names for
Michigan thanks to their
accomplishments this year and
last. But many other athletes
have shown greatimprovements,
making it difficult for Michigan
coach Mike McGuire to name
one "most improved."
"They're all great kids and
work very hard," McGuire
said. "Everyone has had their
moments this year."
But the recent glory is just
one of many accomplishments in
McGuire's 23-year tenure with
the Wolverine women. He boasts
nine Big Ten championships,
most recently in 2012, and nine
more runner-up finishes. The
Michigan women also claimed
nine NCAA regional titles in
that span and has come in 10th
or better 11 times at the NCAA
championships.
Perhaps the most telling sign
of the program's expectations,
though, was its disappointment
with last Friday's third-place
finish at NCAA Pre-Nationals.
"Last week's race wasn't
representative of where we are
assa team," McGuire said.
The men's future was much
less certain entering the 2014
season. This is Michigan coach
Kevin Sullivan's first year in
Ann Arbor and his first head
coaching job. At first, many of
the athletes weren't sure where
the team was headed, and while
the Wolverines haven't won a Big
Ten title since 1993, Sullivan has
won over his team. Michigan's
two first-place finishes have

done wonders for its confidence.
Redshirt junior Mason Ferlic
has emerged as a leader for the
Wolverine men, with individual
titles at the Big Ten Preview and
the Blue and Gold Invitational
in 2014. Ferlic won his first All-
America honors - the first time
a Michigan men's runner has
done so since 2004. Butthe team
is hardly a one-man show.
"(Redshirt freshman) Aaron
Baumgarten has really improved
this year," Sullivan said.
"(Junior) Tony Smoragiewicz
came on strong, too."
Finally, the men are mirroring
the women's success. Though
the men's and women's teams
are separate programs, they
share many common bonds.
McGuire and Sullivan are
both Michigan cross country
and track and field alumni.
They were both mentored by
legendary coach Ron Warhurst,
and both were All-Americans.
More so, McGuire coached the
women at the same time Sullivan
was an athlete at Michigan.
"To a certain extent, Coach
McGuire was a mentor to
me," Sullivan said. "Although
I obviously didn't run on his
teams, I learned more from him
about coaching than he'll likely
ever learn from me."
Yet the bonds extend beyond
the coaches.
The runners often race at the
same meets, always cheering
each other on and lending
support. Many know each other
from high school. Even if the
racers weren't classmates, they
met through racing either at
large invitationals or state meets.
"Michigan is fertile ground
for runners," McGuire said. "I
think, especially today in the
Internet age, the boys and the
girls have a lot of opportunities
to connect with each other."
While both teams are
sharing success, neither one is
overlooking Friday's EMU Fall
Classic.
Both the men and the women
will participate in the race,
which will be held the same
track as the Michigan Open did
on Aug. 29.
Only time will tell if these
heady days for Michigan
cross country will continue.
Regardless of the future - and
past - of both programs are
undeniably linked.

Freshman Dancs learning on top line

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
He was inches away from his
firstgoal.
On Saturday, midway through
the second period, freshman
forward Dexter Danes corralled
a rebound, saw an empty net, but
slid the puck through the crease
and just barely missed.
For Danes, scoring is natural.
Last year, the British Colombia
native tallied 67 points in 56
games with the Vernon Vipers
of the British Columbia Hockey
League. Eleven of those came in
16 playoff games. Danes' knack
for filling the stat sheet enticed
Michigan coach Red Berenson to
offer him a scholarship.
But that scoring prowess

hasn't stood out in Michigan's
first three games. Dancs has
registered only one shot playing
on the Wolverines' top line and
doesn't have a point. Berenson
and his teammates, though,
aren't worried and have said they
think it's just a matter of time
before Dancs fills the stat sheet.
"I've liked the fact that he's
competing hard," Berenson said.
"He's using what got him here
and that's his size, his speed. I
thought he won alot of races this
weekend, he won a lot of puck
battles and then he gives us a
presence alongthe boards."
Dancs admitted the
adjustment to college hockey was
tougher than he expected, saying
his speed and strength weren't
where they needed to be when he

arrived in Ann Arbor. With every
game, though, he feelsi'a tad more
in place.
Sophomore defenseman
Michael Downing can empathize
with Dancs. Downing, who
played alongside then-senior
captain Mac Bennett to form
Michigan's top defensive pairing
last season, said his transition to
college hockey wasn't as easy as
anticipated, either.
"Last year, it took me a
couple of months to get used
to everything and get used
to the speed," Downing said.
"The biggest thing in college is
strength and it's something he's
getting better at, and I think you
guys will see that over the next
couple of weeks."
Luckily for Dancs, ice time

hasn't been a problem. Berenson
has penciled Dancs in as the left
wing on the first line alongside
junior center Andrew Copp
and sophomore right wing JT
Compher - two of Michigan's
best forwards who combined for
60 points last season. More so,
Berenson played Dancs in front
of the net on the power play on
Saturday when sophomore Evan
Allen was a healthy scratch.
Through three games,
however, the first line hasn't
found twine. Still, Berenson
doesn't think Dancs or his
linemates are at fault.
"None of our forwards are
scoring, really," Berenson said.
"We've had four goals by our
forwards in three games. I'm not
worried about Dexter. I think
he'll get his goals when he gets
his chances.
"As long as he's not hurting
us defensively and he's adding
speed, work ethic and defensive
responsibility then he'll be able to
hold his own."
And while Dancs hasn't put
the puck in the net playing next
to two of the Wolverines' greatest
offensive threats, he's learning a
great deal by skatingwith them.
Copp and Compher, Dancs
said, are easing his transition to
college hockey, showing him the
intricacies of moving the puck,
his feet and how to approach each
shift.
The veteran coach hasn't
suggested Dancs will move to a
different line, so Berenson clearly
trusts Dancs.
"I thought I would have to
start at the bottom and work my
way up top," Dancs said. "But
starting at the top really helps my
confidence."
As Dancs gets more
comfortable on the ice, more
quality chances like Saturday's
are inevitable. Next time, he
hopes the puck will find the back
of the net.

Tallarico said. "Then we met

Back at it for another season,
Michigan coach Mike Bottom is
employing the slogan, "One team,

After months of intense
practice, the Michigan women's
swimming and diving team is
eager to showcase its progress
against college swimming's best.
No. 13 Indiana, No. 11 Louisville
and No. 6 Texas come to Ann
Arbor this weekend for the
Wolverines' home opener, and
they are ready for the challenge.
Bottom said he thinks the

made since August will make
crucial differences in timing, and
his swimmers will appreciate the
tweaks once they get in the water.

Grannis takes on
the Blind Pig stage

in this series, three daily arts writers in
varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:
Pumpkin pie?*

Singer-songwriter
talks performance
in Ann Arbor
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Deputy Magazine Editor
It was packed on Sunday night
when singer-songwriter Kina
Grannis broughther alltothe Blind
Pig, whisking audiences away
with an entrancing, storytelling
performance.
Alternating between tracks
in her latest release, Elements,
and her 2010 album, Stairwells,
Grannis interspersed her
acoustically based older tracks
with more newer, experimental
music.
"(The newer music is) a little
more mature," Grannis said in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily before the show. "Stairwells
is a very acoustic album, played
on an acoustic guitar, with basic
drums and very basic bass. With
Elements there's some electric
guitar, the drums are just a
little more interesting and less
straightforward, and just have
weird sounds. We experimented
a lot with background vocals too."
Drawing on a band to fill the
stage for the first time on tour,
Grannis's show was a novel
performance. By incorporating
a full percussion and a bass into
her set, she was able to replicate

the sounds on her studio album.
While during songs such, as "The
Fire" and "Oh Father" the band
overpowered her aerial falsetto,
her vocals during "Winter"
pierced through the tenacious
cymbals.
"We're able to experiment with
sounds a bit more," she explained.
"The sound is a lot closer to what
youhearon the album."
As the show progressed, the
audience pushed through the
corners of the Blind Pig to see
Grannis up-close. And as her
voice cut deeper and deeper, the
crowd nudged closer.
Surprisingly, she's also shy.
Grannis's bashfulness took me
aback. The modesty in her words
is unique in a generally loud and
boastful industry. After absorbing
herself completely in each song,
Grannis took a few moments
to recapture the attention of
the audience, never forgetting
to relate her inspirations and
experiences to those that were
made possible because of her
fans.
Grannis is a rarity. Despite
having built most of her
following by singing covers on
YouTube, her original songs
demonstrate a contemplated
complexity, uncommon
in today's pop landscape.
Throughout the show, fans in
the crowd sang along religiously.
Simultaneously, Grannis
had unique ways of engaging

the crowd. Reminiscing on the
moment that kickstarted her
career, Grannis called onthree of
her fans to sing "Message From
Your Heart" with her on stage.
The song won the Doritos Crash
the Super Bowl contest in 2007,
eventually landing her a contract
with Interscope Records. Earlier
this month, Grannis hosted a
poll on social media to allow
her fans to choose which cover
song would make it on her set
list - later announcing that it
would be "Sweater Weather," by
The Neighborhood. At Sunday's
show, the cover was stunning,
showing Grannis's ability to
modulate a song masterfully to
fit a range of emotions.
"It's a strange thing, because
it's something that's going
on in my brain the whole
day," Grannis said of how she
maintains a strong rapport with
her fans through social media. "I
try to involve them in ways that
are more interactive."
As an artist who gave up a
major label contract to pursue
songwriting independently,
Grannis had advice for younger
musicians pursuing a career in
Ann Arbor's arts industry.
"Sing and play and write
as much as humanly possible
because you will always grow
and you will always improve,"
she said. "Do it for yourself. Do
what excites you and hopefully
that excites other people."

It was already going weird. We had no pie crust, and I had a
migraine, and Erika was not wearing real person clothing. So here is
my admission: I'm not high on weed, or mary jane, or ganja, or any
other weird name for pot that my dad would come up with. I just took
a pill for my migraine, and it's making me feel loopy and weird and I
may have just used the word "cowboy" when I meant to use the word
"pie." The fact that it's 3:00 p.m on the Tuesday makes it weirder
(EDITOR'S NOTE: It was a Wednesday). So we went to Trader Joe's,
where Alec bought cookies for babies which he later said he "regret-
ted" and Erika bought ground meat because she is no longer a vegetar-
ian like we were back in February for around a week. That's how we
became friends. #Michigals. Anyhoo, the pie-making is a disaster.
Let's just say there was a hair dryer involved. And now the hair dryer
is sitting in the oven with a whole rack of ribs. This is such a mess, and
now we are talking about hickeys. The pumpkin pie is cooking away,
hopefully, but this whole situation hasn't been ideal. But the hard
cider was good. Goddamn what is happening. THE PIE SMELLS SO
AMAZING AND WE HAVE HEART-SHAPED OVEN MITTS. Maybe
there is a God.
-EMMA THOMPSON
This pie is a shitshow. The crust has been thawed with a haird-
ryer, Katie's meat is in the oven, no one has a grindr. Or a grinder.
The pie stuff or whatever it's called that goes in it smells good but
this crust is a lumpy son of a bitch. The meat is still in the oven but
we're gonna put the pie in anyway because time is of the essence
and we gotta get to work. The pie will not chANGE IT'S BEEN AN
HOUR JUST BAKE ALREADY WHAT IF IT STARTS TO SMELL
LIKE KATIE'S MEAT. It's gonna taste like ribs and at this point I'm
ok with it. Ughhhhhhhhh we gotta leave now and we never made it
to the roof. I've still never been on my roof and now I probably never
will.
So now we're at the Daily and all I can focus on are Adam's hick-
eys and how my pie is doing no pun intended that pie is generally
fine. It's now 6:00 p.m. and I've texted Katie to get the Id that stands
for low down. She says it will be another 20 minutes. Wait, no she
says it's ready now. Now we gotta walk back to my house and even
though it's sunny it's kind of cool out, which is bullshit.
The pie is back. It's in the fridge and it looks amazing. I can say
this with confidence because news looks jealous as shit which is
honestly all I've ever wanted out of my life. Tonight we will feast on
this pie with vanilla ice cream and Alec's weird trader joe's ginger
snaps. And the only non-arts person who will join us will be Pistol
Pete. Because he is perfect.
-ERIKA HARWOOD
I didn't think this was actually goingto happen, but here we are,
driving to Trader Joe's to get a pie crust. When we get back to Erika's
though, it's clear this is not going to be a smooth operation, given we
only have one hour before work. As Emma Thompson mixes the ingre-
dients, Erika and I read the directions on the back of the pie crust
box. "Let crust defrost for 1-1 1/ hours. DO NOT MICROWAVE." And
since we all wouldn't dare break a rule, the next thing I know Emma
Thompson and I are in the bathroom, hair-drying the frozen pie crust,
trying to unfold it without it breaking into a million pieces. But despite
our inventive defrosting technique, the crust nevertheless broke apart.
We only have one choice - Emma Thompson and I grab the hair-dried
pieces of raw crust, mush it together and spread it out again. Not too
shabby. We pour the filling over the crust and put it in the oven. Erika's
roommate's ribs are in there too, so we can't raise the temperature to
the right level. But with time, patience and a bit of luck, the pie actually
turned out pretty good. (It looks good; we haven't actually tasted it yet).
But we've got the pie, the hard cider and some of that other stuff left
over, so everything should be just fine. Easy as pie.

on singles like Lil Wayne's
"Believe Me" and his own "0

boring - one dimensional
in production and a lyrical
tragedy.
This song has literally
one of the worst hooks ever
- "Girl, How about now.
Because Pm up right now,'
and you suck right now."
God damn. Sounds more

like the script to a Viagra,

Girl, whatever you did, take

"How About Now" is just

CVGA
From Page 1B
And, as Carter explained,
the Archive was founded with
recreational use in mind.
"We knew that was going to
be the case when we started
out," he said. "By opening it up
to anybody who just wants to
come in and play games, any-
one who wants to will come in
and play games."
But by offering video games
and a space to play them for
both University affiliates and
the Ann Arbor community -
anyone with a photo I.D. can
use the Archive's collection -
the CVGA is also filling a gap
in the video game industry cre-
ated by the loss of brick-and-
mortar video rental stores like
Blockbuster in recent years.
In 2014, if you're not sure
about whether you want to buy
a game, the options for testing
out the product beforehand
are severely limited. You can
play the ten minute demo at
your local Gamestop, you can
download the 30 minute demo
directly to your console, or you
can pay $16 a month for a rental
service like Gamefly, which
offers none of the streaming
convenience of Netflix and
only allows you to play one
game at a time before incurring
extra costs. There's a bit more
flexibility on PCs, where you
can easily download an illegal
copy of just about any game you
could think of, but legal demo
options are perhaps even more
limited than they are for con-
soles.
And, of course, the cost of
video game software and hard-
ware can be prohibitive. A
computer capable of smoothly
running popular games like
"League of Legends" will cost
you upwards of $300 at the
least, while consoles like the
PS4 run between $400 and
$500, with new games cost-
ing about $60 and online play
requiring the purchase of year-
ly $50-$60 subscriptions. For
cash-strapped gamers, those
costs often translate into hard
choices about which games to
buy and understandable disap-
pointment when a game doesn't
live up to expectations.
By providing access to the
latest games and the hardware
to play them on, libraries like
the CVGA are expanding access
to and promoting engagement
with games that, because of
factors like cost, might not oth-
erwise be available to interest-
ed gamers.
Beyond lightening cost bur-
dens, however, the Archive's
expansive collection also helps
to make video games more
accessible to individuals and
communities who don't neces-
sarily fit the definition of 'tra-
ditional' gamers.
Part of that work is achieved

through the choice of games
to include in the collection, as
Carter explained.
"(Building the collection)
obviously includes getting a lot
of popular games in there, but
it also involves non-popular
games. Identifying games that
are going to be interesting, or
games that are developed by or
intended for certain non-tra-
ditional audiences, games for
kids, sorts of things that may
not instantly be appreciated by
our regular clientele."
But another, perhaps more
significant part of the process
might be achieved by sim-
ply having a physical space in
which people can meet and
interact with video games on
their own terms. Archive Man-
ager Valerie Waldron described
one example of how the CVGA
has been used to address issues
of sexism and gender-based
exclusion in gaming communi-
ties.
"We had a grad student in
here a couple years back, and
she created a student organiza-
tion - it only lasted for about a
semester because it was a proj-
ect - but it just involved hav-
ing women in here and doing
social events and trying to
make them feel comfortable,"
Waldron said. "Just seeing
what it would look like to have
just women in here and to see
what kind of social interactions
would take place."

NICHOLAS WILLIAMS/Daily
The University's CVGA has helped make games an area for academic study.

1970s and academic collections
like the Video Game Archive at
Ritsumeikan University have
been in operation since the late
1990s in Japan, it's only in the
past ten or fifteen years that
video games have begun to be
considered a serious subject for
academic inquiry in the United
States.
The development of pro-
grams dedicated to the study
of video games at American
universities is an even more
recent phenomenon - the Uni-
versity's CVGA and comparable
collections like the University
of Texas's Videogame Archive,
have only been in existence for
about six years. And, while
some universities offer courses
in the more technical aspects
of video game design, devel-
opment of archives like the
CVGA has rarely been accom-
panied by the creation of any-
thing approaching a 'Video
Game Studies' department that
examines games from an aes-
thetic or cultural standpoint.
But that isn't to say that
nobody is giving video games
serious attention at the Univer-
sity.
A number of professors from
a wide variety of disciplines
- including Comparative Lit-
erature, Statistics, Engineer-
ing and History - currently
teach classes that offer critical
perspectives on video games
and video game culture. And,
since its inception, the CVGA
has worked to make it easier to
incorporate video games into
curricula.
"I think (having the
Archive) greases the wheels, as
it were, for expanding what can
be done," Carter said. "Having
a collection like ours avail-
able here at the University I
think allows faculty who want
to play them in the classroom
or in research to do that more
easily, more readily. They don't
have to build their own collec-
tions to handle stuff and the
library can be responsible for
the care and feeding of those
collections."
Having a wide collection
of older games and especially
older hardware also opens
up avenues for research that
might not otherwise be avail-
able to faculty or graduate
students interested in study-
ing games and game history.
Matt Thompson, a professor in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance who teaches a course on
video game music, particularly
appreciates the selection of
original TVs and audio equip-
ment available alongside the
CVGA's game collection.
"They have TVs from the
era of my childhood, so you can
play 'Super Mario' and hear
it on that TV. I mean, that's
important," he said. "To hear
it in my fancy home surround
sound system is great, but
that's not how 'Super Mario'
sounded. And one of the things
about game audio is, you know,
if you're developing a game for
iPhone, you will probably listen
to it on very expensive equip-
ment, but at the end of the day
you're going to listen to it on

an iPhone. So you might need
to mix it in a certain way, and I
love the fact that the archive has
these different audio technolo-
gies possible."
The CVGA's collection can
also, as Waldron explained,
make certain types of research
much easier and more cost effi-
cient.
"The Transportation Insti-
tute on North Campus, they
wanted a way to simulate driv-
ing so that they could do a tex-
ting-while-driving experiment
- that's not something that you
want to do on the road, and they
had this really expensive driv-
ing simulator over there that is

always reserved for grad stu-
dent projects, more important
projects. So they wanted to find
something relatively cheap, and
it's free to come in here and use
our driving games so they did
that and it worked out really
well."
A collection like the CVGA,
just like any library, provides
a space for academics and
researchers to approach famil-
iar materials with new perspec-
tives. That accessibility can
simply lead to an easier way to
do research, as in the case of the
Transportation Institute's work,
or provide avenues toward new
and exciting studies like Thomp-
son's, which often develop out of
such unexpected sources. But,
most importantly, they provide
the raw materials through which
we can enhance our understand-
ing of and productively compli-
cate our discussions about the
world around us.
Changing How We Think
About Video Games
As the efforts of collections
like the CVGA help to develop
video games into a serious topic
for academic study, they're
contributing to a change in dis-
courses outside of academia as
well.
Two years ago, the Smithso-
nian developed one of the first
museum exhibits to examine
video games as an art form - a
new way to consider the medium
that, in Carter's view, follows
patterns in the way our views of
any popular art change.
"We see this process with
just about every medium that
was once considered a 'trash'
medium," he said. "Movies, tele-
vision; even the novel, when it
was first being developed, was
considered a low form of enter-
tainment. In Shakespeare's
times, plays were considered
something for the lower classes
and high-minded people didn't
pay much attention to them. So
today's trash culture is tomor-
row's culture that's going to be
studied."
At the same time, it's becom-
ing increasingly clear that video
games are developing into one
of the most dominant fields
of artistic expression, both in
terms of cultural importance
and sheer dollar amounts, as
Thompson explained.
"I think a lot of people don't
realize that games generate as
much income as TV and movies
combined each year, and so when
you start to think about it, then
it's like 'Well, if there's so much
money possible, why the crap
aren't we looking at it?'
As video games and the game
industry rise in cultural and
economic importance, they have
some serious problems that they
need to grapple with - issues
with representations of women
and minorities being just two
major examples. But there's no
way to contribute to those discus-
sions without playing the games
themselves and thinking about
them critically, and that may be
where a collection like the CVGA
can have the most impact.
"I'd say that about 75 percent

of the use of the Archive right
now is recreational," Carter said.
"But what that does is that peo-
ple know that we're there, just so
that, especially for the students, .
when they have a class project
or something like that and are
looking for something interest-
ing to do, they'll remember 'Oh,
the Video Game Archive! Maybe
there's some way I can work that
into this project I have."'
And maybe one of those proj-
ects, created by students work-
ing and playing with the entirety
of video game history at their
fingertips, will give us a way to
change those discussions for
the better.

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO
DailyArts Writer
At Espresso Royale,
Madelyn Grant is telling
me how an old high school
friend asked her if she
planned to pursue music
after graduation. A wide
smiles brims from the LSA
senior, remembering how she
laughed dismissively before
saying, "No, I'm gonna do
science." Those turned out to
be famous last words, because
Grant is many things, but a
biologist is not one of them.
Music as a viable career
option is still a fairly recent
development, though - it
was just last year that Grant
changed her major from the
aforementioned Biology to
LSA's music major. Though
Grant may be reticent to
say music is definitely in the
cards (after all, she is only
21 years old), the talented
singer is poised for success.
There is her impressive
voice: in a single song she can
fluctuate between smoldering
powerhouse vocals to synth-
pop-y harmonizing, and there
is also an ODFSZA song called
"Sun Models" featuring Grant
and has garnered more than
two million views on YouTube.
Her collaboration with
ODESZA, a Seattle-based
electronica duo that's made
a name for themselves
with insanely catchy tracks
punctuated by bubble gum
beats and trance-y vocals,
represents a turning point in
Grant's novice career. Last
December, the singer saw a
Facebook post from the band
calling for female vocals. "I
was freaking out, so I stayed
up all night over Christmas
break," she said, "trying to
think of three samples to send
them. I couldn't sleep even
after I sent it, but the next day,
or the day after, they emailed
back saying 'We really like
this, would you wanna work
with us?'"
What makes Grant distinct
is how self-directed and styled
her budding career has been.
Grant was in her high-school
choir and sang for student a
cappella group, 58 Greene,
from freshman to junior year.
She's also a relatively new
songwriter,having begun just
two years ago, but music hasn't
been a serious pursuit until
recently - this is in contrast
to some students who "have
been taking voice lessons
since they were 5." Indeed,
Grant's decision to study
LSA's major over the School
of Music's equivalent was
driven partly by pragmatism

(she would not have been able
to stay on track for a 2015
graduation), but mostly by
the program's wide-ranging
course load that isn't limited
to technical classical training.
From musicology to theory to
performance art technology
classes, Grant described the
major's versatility as being
able to "open a lot of doors
and then begin to narrow
them down." And compared
to the specialized emphasis
in School of Music, LSA's
personalized major melds with
her decidedly entrepreneurial
ethos (Grant is also in the
Program in Entrepreneurship).
That lack of classical
structure seeps into her
music - after all, if you never
learn the rules, it's easy to
break them. While raised on
Motown mainstays like Aretha
Franklin, Stevie Wonder
and Marvin Gaye, Grant also
cites a far-reaching array
of experimental electronica
artists. Listening to them and
going to festivals made the
genre a natural juncture for
the genre-bending singer.
"Sounds and rhythms and
voices you would never think
could go together, worked
so well," Grant said. "And
being new to writing, I loved
how I could use whatever I
was interested in rhythm- or
lyric-wise without being held
back by a technical format or
standard rhyme scheme. In
electronic music, I saw a lot
more freedom to experiment."
That freedom to experiment
outside genre lines, something
every artist holds as a conceit,
is usually discouraged. But
then there are cases like
Grant who prove technical
adherence would only subdue
her voice, which finds its
life in sprawling, graceful
melodies. Take for example,
her collaboration with FKJ
(short for French Kiwi Juice),
a Parisian producer with a
penchant for pairing funky
soul with smooth electronica.
In "Waiting," Grant's smoky,
asymmetric vocals (positively
Winehouse-esque, no other
word for it) snake themselves
around FKJ's ultra-smooth
strain. It's equal parts classic
and experimental.
The collaboration between
FKJ and Grant came about
through a now established
platform for young artists,
social media; Grant sent FKJ
a message on Facebook. In
recent years, the Internet has
become a well-documented
platform for young artists
of all mediums. It typifies
the, egalitarian current that
runs through our generation

- any artist can watch their
work amass viewer/follower/
retweet momentum, providing
their work is good enough.
We've all heard of a poet who
got discovered on Twitter or
the comedian who launched
a career from a YouTube
channel. Grant, herself is
a SoundCloud user, and in
January when she posted a
collaboration with School of
Music jazz student, Alekos
Syropoulos, a slinky jazz song
called "Purpose," it racked
up over 79,000 listens on the
website. Scrolling through
the hundreds of gushing
comments, it's obvious that
Grant's singing sparks the rare
visceral reactions from fans.
Madelyn Grant:
Poised for
success.
The internet has also been a
necessary tool in bridging the
geographical gaps between
Grant and her high-profile
collaborators: FKJ resides in
Paris, and the ODESZA duo
in Seattle. In FJK' case, it was
all done via Facebook and
e-mail. He sent her a rough
instrumental track with the
guitar, synthesizer, and drums,
Grant wrote to it, and after
they agreed on a general idea,
the two passed the song back
and forth, FKJ working on the
mixing, while Grant wrote and
recorded in Ann Arbor, made
easy by a shared background.
"We both have a love for
Motown, so we were already on
the same page of style, so I felt
really comfortable expressing
myself with a soulful style."
While plenty of remote
opportunities are within
Grant's reach, the Ann Arbor
community is particularly
special to her: "There's
this whole awesome circle,
community, really, you have tdY
just get your foot in the door,
but it's like a family," Grant
said. "Obviously they're all
from the same city, but they all
go to each other's shows, play
in each other's bands."
Grant eventually sees
herself moving to a bigger
music city, but her hopes have
a healthy dose of practicality,
and Ann Arbor isn't a bad
place for a developing artist.
"There's a lot of gaps
between wanting to have a
music career and actually
doing it, so it's really cool to
be around local musicians
who are doing it."

East Quad groups
have the potential to
make a difference
By ADAM THEISEN
Daily Music Editor
When they were living togeth-
er sophomore year, Residential
College students Talya Nakash,
Emily Preuss, Alia Raheem and
MariannaYamamoto would sit in
their living room and talk about
women of color in the media -
race, gender and the portrayals
that they saw. Now as seniors,
they're doing the same thing
every week, but dozens of people
showup with them to take part in
the conversation.
"We thought this would be so
cool if we could expand this and
put it in a more structured envi-
ronment so that everyone in the
RC and people who were interest-
ed could have the benefit of gain-
ingaspace likethis," Nakash said.
As co-leaders and co-found-
ers of Feminist Forum, the four
head up a discussion every Mon-
day night in East Quad, covering
a wide variety of intersectional
social topics.
Several of these types of
groups meet weekly underthe RC
Forumumbrella, whether they're
discussing social issues like Fem-
inist and LGBT*QA Forums, or
they're more focused on artis-
tic expression like Poetry and
Creative Writing Forums. RC
Forums can be anything, so long
as they're substantive and have
passionate members.
The forum system was origi-
nally proposed during the final
years of old East Quad by an
RC senior who had gone to Ann
Arbor's alternative Commu-
nity High School, where their
version of "homerooms" were
"forums" that brought together
9th through 12th grade students.
"The main impetus for the
RC was 'let's find a way to bring
upper-level students and lower-
level students inthe RC into clos-
er contact,"' said Jennifer Myers,
associate director for Curricu-
lum and Director of Academic

Services. "Because when the
upper-level student moved out,
it was hard for them to maintain
those ties."
. A 1974 study of Community
High School by the University's
School of Social Work describes
the alternative learning facility
as having "maximum individu-
ality within maximum commu-
nity," but that motto could be
applied just as accurately to
the RC, a part of the University
where faculty insist on being
called by their first names and,
back in the '70s, didn't even give
out grades.
"The history of the RC has
been one that supports a lot of
student autonomy," Myers said.
"I had always pictured myself
in an environment closer to a
small liberal arts college, but I
also really wanted the resources
of a large university," said RC
junior and co-leader of Food
Forum Amanda Nelson, which
is now in its second year. "I can
walk through the halls and know
most of the people and know that
they share certain interests."
In their first year, the variety
of forums also included faculty
members. Since then, they've
been entirely student-run affairs,
with little-to-no interference
from the college itself.
"It became quickly clear that
wasn't the way to go," Myers said.
"Because when you have a faculty
person in the room, it's easy to
revert back to the faculty person
leading discussion and driving
things, and we didn't want it to be
that. So the faculty stepped out,
and we left it to the students, and
it's been that way ever since."
While there are no profes-
sors present, students can still
earn class credit for participat-
ing in a forum. Once an RC club
has existed for a semester, it can
be approved to become a fully-
fledged forum, at which point
its regular members may elect
to receive credit for attending.
This leads to an environment in
which the forums can feel like a
much more casual classroom, or
an educational discussion among
peers.
"It's academic, but not peda-

gogical," Nelson said.
At this week's Feminist Forum
meeting,Nakash,Preuss,Raheem
and Yamamoto led a discussion
on sexual assault of Native Amer-
ican women in a circle of over 30
students. While Nakash takes the
lead by introducing the topic and
providing facts, the leaders make
a conscious effort to let the unas-
suming members speak first if
they have input on the subject. In
that way, the forums really paral-
lel RC classes, in which profes-
sors often moderate discussion,
but usually step back and let the
students carry iton their own.
Myers says that enrollment
seems to have gone up since East
Quad has been renovated, but
there are still challenges facing
the RC in this new building. This
year's RC senior class has expe-
rienced old East Quad, a year in
West Quad and now two years
in the new, renovated East Quad,
which some say has hurt the com-
munity aspect of the college.
"It was weird, because our
RC classes weren't even in West
Quad," said RC senior Danielle
Leonard, who was co-leader of
LGBT*QA forum during her
sophomore year. "The forum
meetings were in South Quad
sometimes. But I feel like we've
restored it a lot. I feel like last
year was kind of 'getting the RC
back into East Quad' and figur-
ing all that out, and this year it's
finally like a community again.
The new East Quad hasn't
been without criticism though,
with many saying that the
updated building is like a hotel,
compared to the run-down old
building that they say was full
of character. The demise of
the autonomous, student-run
Halfway Inn, a basement per-
formance space/caf6 for RC stu-
dents, seemed symbolic of these
changes. Last year, the "Take
Back The RC" group protested
the changes by painting murals
on empty East Quad walls (a
tribute to the days of Old EQ),
leading to a revamped RC art
policy.
"Some of the alums have come
back, and this is almost like you
left your house, and somebody

redid your whole house. You
approach the house, and from
the outside it pretty much looks
the same, but you walk in and it
is completely different. It has to
be stunning," Myers said. "On
the other hand, though, the new
students coming in, this is what
you know as what the RC is, and
students have not been dissatis-
fied."
The question is, then, how
will the RC put its stamp on New
East Quad? Myers talks about
how as programs change, she
wants to open up more EQ space
specifically for RC students, but
for the moment, the forums are
now one of the few ways to see
the community aspect of the
RC on full display. You can walk
into East Quad at lunchtime and
hear French, German, Russian,
Spanish and even Latin being
spoken by large groups as part
of the RC's intensive language
program, or you can wander the
dorm and perhaps try to pick out
the more eccentrically dressed
people, but the forums where
often what brings students
together the most.
With the constant turnover of
leaders and members, it can be
difficult to keep a forum running
strong.
"It's hard to keep a new forum
going, because when it's new,
everyone wants to join it, but
then everyone kind of flocks to
the new forums," Leonard said.
"It takes dedicated leaders (to
keep a forum running), people
willing to assume responsibil-
ity," Myers said. "Sometimes
when you don't have that person
ready to step up, it can really fall
by the wayside."
This makes it imperative that
older forum leaders train and
groom younger members to take
over when they graduate.
And while on a week-to-week
basis the socially conscious
forums may just be reaching
out to people who already agree
with them and won't necessar-
ily change anyone's mind, they
do provide a safe, open space
and can raise consciousness in
people who care about pressing
social issues.
"Obviously people who have
(anti-LGBT*QA beliefs) aren't
going to be the ones joining our
forum ... so we definitely try to
make it a safe space," Leonard
said. "I think more than anything
it can act, just like a very safe,
enclosed space where everyone
can just be open about anything.
As much as a zone can be judg-
ment-free it's definitely a judg-
ment-free zone."
Forums also have the potential
to make a larger difference on
campus, though, as lastyear Fem-
inist Forum hosted a talk by Jim
DeRogatis in a large-scale event
that was practically unprecedent-
ed for an RC forum. The leaders
are looking to do a similar, even
larger event this year.
However, despite a possibility
for expansion and more events,
the forum leaders still also want
to focus on sharing their passions
with other members.
"I learned that if you don't feel
like you have a space on campus,
to just go and create your own,"
Raheem said. "If you think that

there's something out there
that you care about, most likely
there's going to be someone else
who cares about it as well and is
just as passionate and you should
get out there and shout it out."

Hi, my name is Skyler and
I'm a music pirate addict.
I'm kinda nervous to be
here to be honest. I heard
about this group from my
old friend Ronnie who's also
a recovering addict - actu-
ally come to think of it, just
yesterday Ronnie called me
all giggidy with some great
news while I was mid-shift
at the hospital (I'm 'a year
into my residency). He said
he had just bought, with
money, like real dollars, his
first song in over 10 years.
Big deal, I know, and I was
super excited for Ronnie and
while I probably shouldn't
have picked up the phone
while inserting my first-
ever IV drip, I was so super
happy for Ronnie like I said,
and couldn't help myself
- and a blood transfusion
later, Ms. Henderson was
conscious again, so no big-
gie. Claps for Ronnie!
Anyway, I think I'm sup-
posed to tell my own story
about how I got here so
here goes. It all started
back in junior high school,
when exchanging iTunes
libraries was as ordinary as
dying of dysentery in Ore-
gon Trail". All you did was
hand over your iPod to that
friend-with-great-music-
taste for the night and the
next day you had a thou-
sand new songs - no cost to
you, no cost to your friend.
So amazing! Soon enough,
I had stockpiled a library
5,000 songs strong, of which
maybe 200 were original-
ly mine, of which all were
from my father's embarrass-
ing CD collection, of which
contained the soundtrack
to Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat, of
which I know every fucking
word ...
But there was also all
the music I wanted but
could never actually ask
my friends for because that
would be like, straight social
suicide. Like omg, if Ronnie
knew I owned all six Kelly
Clarkson albums, or that I
not only own but have mem-
orized the tracklists for Now
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 - just
kill me. So I did the sen-
sible thing and downloaded
LimeWire, which I'm sure
you all know about because
anyone who's an addict
knows about LimeWire, a
service that fostered illegal
downloading.
Life on LimeWire was
mojitos on the beach, but
like forever. I could down-
load virtually any song I
desired - Sheryl Crow's
whole discography, the
"Pokemon" theme song, you
name it! - and all for free.
It quickly progressed from

a weekly thing to the point
where I was downloading
almost constantly, I'm talk-
ing a few times a day. And
when LimeWire didn't have
what I wanted, I tried Nap-
ster, Ka-zaa, Gnutella, what-
ever might get me the song
I was craving. I will say I
bought an external hard
drive for my 20,000-song
library, so I didn't complete-
ly steal everything if you
think about it philosophical-
ly or whatever. Also, I once
went into a record store and
bought a poster of the Dark
Side of the Moon album cover
because it's my favorite (I
have Pink Floyd's whole dis-
cography), so that counts too
I think.
Those were the days,
before all the bullshit gov-
ernment regulation that
made stealing music less
convenient. Then Big Broth-
er cracked down on Nap-
ster, LimeWire, Ka-zaa, all
the peer-to-peer file shar-
ing services, and ruined my
fun. So I, being the innova-
tive person I am, discovered
BitTorrent, pirate-bay.org
and other sites like it, which
made it possible to steal
movies and soft-ware too!
But then Jammie Thom-
as-Rasset happened - you
know, the woman who
got sued by the Record-
ing Industry Association
of America (RIAA) for
$220,000 ($54,000 for each
of the 24 songs she down-
loaded illegally). When Ron-
nie told me about the suit,
and the 18,000 others filed
by the .RIAA against simi-
lar individuals, I pissed my
pants, changed into a fresh
pair, did some back-of-the-
napkin math that concluded
my own suit would add up to
$1 billion and change, and
then pissed my pants again
(Do you know how much
debt med students have
already?!?)
I'm fucking
scared, guys.
That was a few days ago,
and I'm fucking, scared
guys. I got my Locs on and
keep the oven on now in case
the FBI shows up so I can
destroy my hard-drive. I've
been trying to lay low, get
this addiction under control,
but dependence is real. Like
last night, I downloaded
every song by Beethoven and
Mozart just because I can. I
know it's wrong, but it's just
so easy. I'm not a bad per-
son guys, I just want to be a
gynecologist.
This is a work of fiction.

SINGLE REVIEW

9 AM to 5:30 PM
1225 South Hall
University of Michigan Law School
lawumich.edu/FinReform I #UMFinReg


Gwen Stefani's highly antici-
pated comeback -you know,
the one that we've been asking
for since
2006's The B
Sweet Escape,
since No Baby
Doubt's much- Don't Lie
welcomed
(yet ulti- Gwen Stefani
mately under- Interscope
whelming)
2012 comeback and since she
announced thatshe'd be a coach
on this fall's cycle of "The Voice"
- is finally happening. It's a
thing, you guys. On Saturday she
released the firstsingle fromher
upcoming third studio album
and it's anything but disappoint-
ing.
Upon first listen, "BabyDon't
Lie" isn't a total home run; it's not
a songthat you impulsively buy
on iTunes after listening to it for
30 seconds and it doesn't scream
"firstsingle" right away. Like, on
a scale of one to Taylor Swift's
"Shake It Off" breaking the Inter-
net, "BabyDon't Lie"... didn't.

But that was to be expected -
Stefani hasn't released newsolo
material in eight years so, much
like Fergie's recently released
"L.A.Love (La La)," there wasn't
ever going to be much universal
fanfare around this release. It's
simply been too longsince she's
connected to us through her
music. Though she never lost
her pop culture relevance, Gwen
Stefani's extended absence from
music gave her something to
prove.
After a few more listens,
"Baby Don't Lie" becomes more
of the single we were hoping to
hear from Stefani - one that
gets stuck in your head, one that
doesn't sound like everything
that's already out there, one that
is inherently Gwen. Its reggae-
tinged beat pulsates more and
more and itslyrics have some
actual meaning. Asking for more
from Gwen would've been asking
too much; "Baby Don't Lie" isn't a
disappointmentand, considering
she wrote the song with Benny
Blanco and Ryan "Halo" Tedder,

KEYNOTE SPEAKER

Financial Protection Bureau

that shouldn't come as a surprise
to anyone.
Gwen Stefani's resurgence
has been a reassuringly feeltgood
one - not that there was ever
any doubtthatshe was stillthe
impossibly awesome and one-of-
a-kind person she was when she
was a teenager in No Doubt, but
her presence on "The Voice" this
season let us witness it first-hand.
As the only female coach, Gwen
Stefani isn't just "one of the boys,"
she runs the whole show and
doesn't take any shit fromher

INTERSCOPE
comrades. Together with fellow-
newcomer Pharrell Williams,
Gwen has given Adam Levine a
run for his moneyin swaying the
best contestants to join her team
and it'sbeen a joyto watch.
"Baby Don't Lie" may not
end up being a chart-topper for
Gwen Stefanibut it sure as hell
is a solid comeback single that
retains everything it means to
be a Gwen Stefani song. Now I'm
just waiting for her to perform it
on "The Voice."
