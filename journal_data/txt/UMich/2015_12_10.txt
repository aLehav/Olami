From deer cull to 
departure of key city 
officials, 2015 marked 

year of change 

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

For City Hall and the Ann 

Arbor City Council, the past year 
has been one of major changes — 
from an influx of new faces on 

city staff to an unprecedented 
decision to hire sharpshooters 
to reduce Ann Arbor’s deer 
population. As the year wraps up, 
The Michigan Daily is reviewing 
City Council’s major challenges 
and successes throughout 2015, 
and what the year’s progress, or 
lack thereof, will mean for the 
year ahead.

City staffing changes

In 2015, the city of Ann 

Arbor lost upward of five key 
city 
leaders. 
Among 
these 

were the police chief, the city 

administrator, the city fire chief, 
the city community services 
area administrator and the city 
planning manager.

A challenge for the city in 

the coming months will be 
finding the resources and staff 
to accommodate council’s needs. 
According to Councilmember 
Zach Ackerman (D–Ward 3), an 
LSA senior, council will need to 
slow down with policy change in 
the beginning of 2016.

“We have a leadership vacuum 

in City Hall, five of them are 

senior positions that all left the 
city within a year,” Ackerman 
said. “The responsible thing is to 
slow down policy wise and make 
sure that we have the key players 
we need to make sure that what 
we want to implement can be 
implemented.”

Chuck Warpehoski (D–Ward 

5) also said the openings will 
slow down Ann Arbor for a while.

“There’s a lot of vacancies at 

the top of the organization and 
the organization is tight on staff 

CITY COUNCIL

Supreme Court to 
once again consider 
use of race in college 
admissions process

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

Amid increased discussion of 

race on college campuses across the 
country, the U.S. Supreme Court 
heard oral arguments Wednesday 
in Fisher v. University of Texas, a 
case that could diminish the use 
of affirmative action in college 
admissions processes.

The case considers the legality 

of institutions of higher education 
using race as one of many factors 
when 
making 
admissions 

decisions. Abigail Fisher, a white 
woman from Texas, is suing the 
University of Texas at Austin 
because she believes she would 
have been admitted to the school if 
not for her race.

At the time, UT-Austin granted 

automatic admission to students 
who were in the top 10 percent of 

their high school classes, which 
makes up about 75 percent of 
UT-Austin’s student body. Though 
this plan does not explicitly 
consider race as a factor, it is 
intended to result in a more diverse 
collegiate student body since high 
schools in the state may not be 
diverse. Fisher did not make this 
cut at her high school.

The Supreme Court previously 

heard the case in 2012, when the 
justices remanded it to a lower 
court. The case then made its way 
back up through the court system 
through the Fifth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. The Fifth Circuit ruled 
against Fisher, but that decision 
was appealed and again sent to the 
Supreme Court in 2014.

The case follows a line of 

Supreme Court decisions ruling 
on the use of affirmative action, 
including two cases challenging 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

admissions policies. In 2003, the 
court ruled in Gratz v. Bollinger 
that the University’s point system 
for undergraduate admissions was 
unconstitutional, but that the use 
of race as one of many factors by the

RESEARCH
TECHNOLOGY

Policy also creates 

oversight board 
to ensure best 

research practices

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

After 
University 
President 

Mark Schlisselpledged in April 
to enhance on-campus laboratory 
safety, 
the 
University 
has 

implemented a standardized lab 
safety policy, on top of creating 
an 
oversight 
committee 
on 

laboratory and research safety.

The new Academic Laboratory 

and 
Research 
Safety 
Policy 

applies to all University students, 
faculty and staff. The policy 
outlines 
the 
responsibilities 

of those in a management or 
supervisory 
position 
for 
the 

safety of those who serve under 
them.

Danielle 
Sheen, 
associate 

director 
of 
research 
and 

operations safety from the Office 
of 
Occupational 
Safety 
and 

Environmental Health, said the 
policy changes intend to put more 
emphasis on following existing 
policies and formalizing current 
safety practices.

“There 
have 
been 
some 

recent tragedies on university 
campuses across the nation and 
University leadership wanted to 
be proactive to emphasize the 
importance of safe research to 
prevent any similar outcomes on 
our campus,” Sheen wrote in an 
e-mail interview.

The 
policy 
begins 
with 

emphasizing 
reporting 
and 

resolving health and safety issues. 
Position-specific responsibilities 
increase 
with 
the 
level 
of 

authority, the majority of which 
rests with the laboratory director.

“A culture of safety is a shared 

responsibility and this policy 
formalizes the role of everyone 
in the U-M research community,” 
Sheen wrote. “This information 
did not previously exist in a 
policy format for individuals to 
reference.”

The new policy also defines the 

roles of those on the University 

Human Rights 

Commission holds 
forum on proposed 
civilian commission

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor Human Rights 

Commission met at Larcom City 
Hall on Tuesday night to discuss 
an advisory report on improving 

police-community 
relations. 

The commission, which reports 
directly to the Ann Arbor City 
Council, opened the meeting 
to the public. More than 30 
community members attended, 
over half of whom voiced 
concerns about the 42-page 
report released last month.

In the report, the commission 

calls for the formation of an 
independent 
civilian 
review 

board, 
the 
hiring 
of 
an 

independent 
police 
auditor 

and the formation of crisis 

intervention 
teams. 
The 

discussion of the proposals 
comes at a critical time for 
the 
city’s 
police 
force, 
as 

James 
White, 
an 
assistant 

chief with the Detroit Police 
Department, will take over as 
the department’s new chief in 
January.

report, emphasized the importance 
of community input.

“We cannot set aside the fact 

that police cannot be expected to 
police themselves. Right?” Wilson 
asked, to loud applause from the 
audience.

However, Nearly all of the 

community members who spoke 
criticized the resolution because 
of insufficient power delegated 
to citizens. Public Health student 
Rebecca 
Ahmad-Robinson, 
a 

member of the advocacy group 

Ann Arbor to Ferguson, specifically 
questioned the decision to allow the 
mayor to select the review board.

“(The report) is lacking teeth 

in a lot of ways,” she said. “The 
language 
has 
been 
changed 

multiple times so that it looks more 
like a watered down civilian review 
board. We would seek to empower 
the civilian oversight board to 
participate in the hiring and firing 
of police officers.”

The 
commission 
set 

about writing the report last 
November, 
motivated 
in 
part 

by the police shooting of Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser, and 
the subsequent scrutiny of the 

city’s 
police 
department 
and 

national 
conversations 
about 

police brutality. Rosser’s name 
was invoked multiple times by 
community members during the 
meeting, but Ypsilanti resident 
Michelle Barney, a representative 
of the NAACP, cautioned the 
commission against leaning too 
heavily on Rosser’s legacy as an 
immediate motivation. 

“You have been engaged in 

a 
make-nice 
process,” 
Barney 

said. “You look like you’re doing 
something so that we don’t have riots 
in the streets, so that we don’t have 
Ferguson, Chicago (or) Baltimore.”

Shirley Beckley, an Ann Arbor 

resident and an organizer with Ann 
Arbor to Ferguson, echoed that 
mentioning Rosser cannot cover up 
the recommendations’ shortfalls.

“You mention Aura’s name 

several time in the opening, and 
then propose a review and not 
an oversight. Anything less than 
community control of the police is 
worse than nothing,” she said.

The evaluation of community 

involvement on the resolution 
shifted to a critique of the meeting’s 
format itself. Though the agenda 
only allowed for comments from 
the public, speakers demanded 
replies from commissioners as 
well. The audience’s insistence 

ultimately pushed Linda Winkler, 
the vice-chair of the commission 
and acting chair, to motion for time 
specifically reserved for questions. 
 

“This is important enough to 

me as a Black community person 
and a person who cares about this 
town, that we have dialogue,” 
Beckley said. “When you don’t 
talk to us, it just makes us feel like 
we’re not important, and this is 
just something that you designed. 
I know how hard Dwight Wilson 
worked on this report. Don’t throw 
us off like that because you’re 
going to do nothing but anger us. 
We’re trying to work with you. 
I’m not going to sit here another 

70 years and see this happen in my 
community. Please talk to us.”

The resulting extra time for 

discussion centered around the 
commission’s concrete takeaways 
from the forum and commissioners 
emphasized 
that 
all 
concerns 

voiced will ultimately be passed 
on for City Council’s consideration. 
Though the report is only a set 
of 
nonbinding 
considerations, 

commissioners and community 
members 
agreed 
that 
the 

commission, the community and 
White, the incoming police chief, 
need to engage in more discussion 
before the report appears on the 
council’s agenda.

Protesters demonstrate outside of the Supreme Court during the Fisher v. University of Texas case on Oct. 10, 2012.

Law School, challenged in Grutter 
v. Bollinger, was constitutional. 
However, Michigan voters in 2006 
opted to ban the use of race in 
admissions via a statewide ballot 
initiative.

Richard Primus, a University 

professor of constitutional law, said 
what is currently being presented 
to the court for consideration is 
hardly different than what was 
discussed back in 2012.

“As a substantive matter, there’s 

very little in this oral argument 
that didn’t already exist in the 
paper record,” he said. “People will 
over-evaluate the oral argument 
for signals, but most of the time, 
at least much of the time, that is a 
mistake.”

Substantively, oral arguments 

are a forum in which the justices 
question the counsel of both sides 
of a case. Primus said in cases that 
are overwhelmingly technical or 
nuanced, oral arguments can be 
very informative for justices, but 
it is less so here since this is the 
second time the court is hearing 
this case.

“Oral argument is least likely to 

change an outcome in a case like 
this one,” he said. “Every judge 
has a well-developed sense of 
these ideas and a well-developed 
set of views about these ideas. The 
information has been thoroughly 
digested and re-digested. They’re 
not going to (use the) argument to 
learn new things.”

Justice Elena Kagan has recused 

herself from the case, and the 
court’s four more conservative 
justices are expected to side with 

Fisher. Of the four remaining 
justices, three are expected to side 
with the University of Texas and 
Justice Anthony Kennedy will 
likely be the swing vote.

In 
oral 
arguments, 
Justice 

Antonin Scalia, one of the four 
conservative justices, referred to 
some beliefs which questioned the 
place of some minority student 
beneficiaries of affirmative action 
at public universities during the 
oral arguments.

“There are those who contend 

that it does not benefit African 
Americans to get them into the 
University of Texas where they 
will not do well, as opposed to 
having them go to a less — a slower-
track school where they do well,” 
he said, according to the transcript 
of the oral arguments. “One of the 
briefs pointed out that most of the 
Black scientists in this country 
don’t come from schools like the 
University of Texas.”

Scalia continued that African-

American 
students 
come 
to 

colleges from “lesser schools,” and 
arrive at college to find the classes 
are too hard for them.

“I’m just not impressed by the 

fact that the University of Texas 
may have fewer (African-American 
students),” he said. “Maybe it ought 
to have fewer. And maybe some — 
you know, when you take more, the 
number of Blacks, really competent 
Blacks, admitted to lesser schools 
turns out to be less.”

Gregory G. Garre, legal counsel 

for the University of Texas, said 
the court had previously rejected 
that sentiment.

“If you look at the academic 

performance of holistic minority 
admits versus the top 10 percent 
admits, over time, they fare better,” 

he said. “And, frankly, I don’t think 
the solution to the problems with 
student body diversity can be to 
set up a system in which not only 
are minorities going to separate 
schools, they’re going to inferior 
schools.”

The University’s Black Student 

Union did not respond to an 
interview request.

Citing his judicial record, media 

outlets and academics speculate 
Kennedy will join the conservative 
four in a ruling against the 
University of Texas, but Primus 
said that may be too speculative. 
In speaking about the utility of the 
oral argument, he noted Kennedy 
could also opt to send the case back 
to the Fifth Circuit.

“If there’s anything in the oral 

argument that’s fodder for further 
prediction, it’s the possibility that 
Justice Kennedy, once again, might 
like to find a technical way out,” 
he said. “In his questioning of 
Fisher’s counsel, he talked about 
the possibility of sending the thing 
back to the district court. Later, he 
seemed to back off that a little bit.”

However, in the event of a tie 

vote, with Kennedy joining the 
liberal justices and siding with the 
University of Texas, the previous 
Fifth Circuit ruling will prevail.

Media outlets and academics 

have also been speculating what 
the court’s decision — due in June 
or early July — could look like, and 
what could be the implications of 
outlawing the race in admissions.

Some have suggested that 

universities may turn to other 
forms of affirmative action, such 
as class-based or socioeconomic-
based methods.

Primus said the adoption of 

class-based systems opens another 

can of worms, but that the potential 
effects of such programs to achieve 
racial diversity could affect the 
outcome of the case at hand.

“The more Justice Kennedy 

thinks that race-blind, class-
based affirmative action can 
produce racial diversity, the more 
likely he is to rule against the 
University (of Texas) in this case,” 
he said. “The more he recognizes 
that such means don’t produce 
that result, the more likely he is to 
rule for the university.”

Ann Lin, a professor of public 

policy at the University, said 
Fisher’s argument is that 10 percent 
plans — whereby the top 10 percent 
of high school graduating classes 
are guaranteed admission to a state 
university — like the one at the 
University of Texas, are preferable 
to holistic review processes that 
use factors including race.

“That approach is one that 

schools like Michigan have always 

rejected — rejected them because 
top 10 plans only create (racial) 
diversity if you have extreme 
segregation in your state … this 
works in Texas because Texas is 
one of the most segregated states 
in the nation,” she said. “But, it 
doesn’t work if either you have 
diverse school bodies in which the 
top 10 percent of the school doesn’t 
reflect the diversity of the school, 
and it also doesn’t work if you have 
pockets of racial segregation in 
which the high schools are also of 
different sizes.”

To 
that 
end, 
Primus 
said 

proponents of affirmative action 
might rationally fear that Kennedy 
will rule with Fisher against race-
based affirmative action, and that 
the court’s decision will fail to 
specify the circumstances under 
which universities are allowed 
to conduct holistic review, even 
without the use of race.

“The reason in that circumstance 

that universities might not be able 
to do holistic review would be the 
claim that they could do percentage 
plans instead,” he said. “And then 
the whole game would be about 
arguing that a given university, 
given its local demographics, or its 
size or its mission, was not well-
suited for the use of a percentage 
plan.”

Lin said holistic plans allow 

institutions like the University to 
be aware of race in admissions, 
even 
if 
they 
don’t 
explicitly 

consider it, and to achieve a broad 
definition of diversity. She said 
schools can use other parameters, 
such as first-generation status, 
which are correlated with race to 
reach this diversity.

“If 
you 
have 
a 
broader 

definition of diversity, including 
diversity of skills and talents and 
socioeconomic status, you cannot 
get it from a top 10 percent plan,” 
she said.

become too narrow or collapse.

According to Scott Hollister, 

a 
professor 
of 
biomedical 

and mechanical engineering, 
tracheobronchomalacia occurs 
once in every 2,200 births. In 
the United States, that averages 
about 1,500 to 1,800 patients a 
year with the condition, with 
ranging severity. While some 
kids with a mild form of the 
condition will not need medical 
intervention, 
those 
with 

moderate to very severe forms 
require treatment that can 
potentially be life-saving.

“The kids exhale, which 

puts a negative pressure in 
the airway that tends to want 
to collapse the airway,” he 
said. “With normal cartilage 
it will hold up the airway, but 
with these kids it collapses 
completely and they can’t get 
air out of their lungs.”

Hollister 
said 
he 
began 

working 
with 
3D 
printing 

technology as an approach 
to 
treating 
the 
condition 

when he met Glenn Green, an 
otolaryngologist at C.S. Mott 
Children’s 
Hospital, 
in 
the 

summer of 2011. Green suggested 
working on an external device 
that 
could 
directly 
treat 

tracheobronchomalacia.

The 
splint 
used 
for 

tracheobronchomalacia 
is 

three-quarters of a cylinder, 
with a small opening on one side 
of the cylinder. Since a person’s 
airway is similar to a tube, and 
part of that tube is collapsing, 
the splint is placed surgically 
on the exterior of the airway to 
pull the airway open.

“We do a CT scan for the 

child prior to the surgery, and 
so when the child exhales we 
can see where the collapsed 
segment is and how long the 
collapsed segment is,” Hollister 
said. “Then from the inhalation 
scan, we get an idea from the 

diameter of the collapsed region 
under inhalation pressures.”

The 
doctors 
take 

measurements from both scans 
and use those measurements 
to design the splint. While all 
splints have the same general 
geometry, the diameter and 
the length of the cylinder are 
customized for each patient.

Hollister said the doctors 

were worried about whether 
or not the splint would allow 
for growth of the patient over 
time. To address this challenge, 
doctors took periodic imaging 
to look at the size of the 
airways, and determined that 
airways still grow, even with 
the attached splint.

Hollister said he was already 

familiar with Materialise, as 
he had previously used their 
software to teach a class and 
employed it while developing 
the splint.

Hollister said the company 

contacted him upon hearing 
about 
the 
first 
procedure 

using the splint in 2013, and 
wanted to help develop the 
technology for clinical use. The 
company, which has a branch 
in Plymouth, Mich., used its 
technology to help design the 
customized splints. Since Green 
and Hollister work on the 
project through the University, 
Materialise needed to work 
with the University to come up 
with a licensing agreement for 
the technology.

“This agreement is a critical 

step in our goal to make this 
treatment readily available for 
other children who suffer from 
this 
debilitating 
condition,” 

Green said in a press release.

Polycaprolactone, 
the 

material used to make the 
splints, is bioresorbable, so 
fluids in the body will cause the 
polymer to break down over 
time. This particular polymer 
takes about three to four years 
to be completely resorbed by the 
body, making a repeat surgery 
unnecessary.

While 
currently 
the 

technology is not approved 
by the FDA, the agency has 
given clearance to use it for 
emergency life-or-death cases. 
The splint has been implanted 
in four children, all of whom 
were between about three and 
16 months of age. The doctors 
reported that the patients all 
responded well to the surgery. 

“Here 
at 
Materialise, 

we strongly believe in the 
transformative 
power 
of 

great 
collaborations, 
such 

as the one we have enjoyed 
these past two years with Dr. 
Green, Dr. Hollister and all 
others who have contributed 
to this life-saving application 
of 3D printing,” said Bryan 
Crutchfield, managing director 
of Materialise U.S.A. in a press 
release. 
“This 
collaboration 

is proof that when the right 
skill 
sets 
and 
technologies 

are combined, solutions can 
be found for problems once 
thought impossible.”

to begin with, so managing all of 
that is going to be difficult,” he 
said. “We all have to reel in our 
expectations a bit about what we 
can do as a staff and what we have 
the resources for.”

The search for a new city 

administrator 
is 
an 
extensive 

process that could take up to 
three months. The administration 
committee, with the help of a 
search firm, will narrow down 
the potential applicants for the 
post. After finalists are selected, 
a series of public interviews and 
forums will be held before a 
recommendation is made to City 
Council.

Tom Crawford, Ann Arbor’s 

chief financial officer, is serving as 
interim city administrator.

Ackerman said it will be crucial 

in the coming months to find 
suitable replacements for these key 
positions.

“We will need to hire a terrific 

city administrator who can oversee 
the whole operation, hire a strong 
community service administrator 
who can improve those customer 
service aspects of City Hall,” 
Ackerman said. “Then, make sure 
we have a good building manager 
and planning manager to make sure 
that any development that does go 
forward is attractive and safe.”

In 
November, 
council 

unanimously 
approved 
City 

Administrator 
Steve 
Powers’ 

recommendation to appoint James 
White as Ann Arbor police chief. 
Currently an assistant police chief 
with the Detroit Police Department, 
White begin his new position in 
Ann Arbor on Jan. 11, 2016.

Police-community relations
The year started with continued 

protest against police brutality 
in light of the death of Ann Arbor 
resident Aura Rosser, who was shot 
by an Ann Arbor police officer last 
November. 

In late January, the Washtenaw 

Prosecutor’s Office concluded Ann 
Arbor Police Officer David Ried 
would not face criminal charges for 
the fatal shooting.

Following the ruling, protesters 

gathered outside City Hall to 
protest the decision. Protesters 
filled downtown streets, disrupting 
traffic 
and 
shouted 
chants 

including “Black Lives Matter.”

Late December 2014, council 

voted to appropriate $173,760 to 
upgrade the police in-car cameras 
and 
body 
cameras. 
However, 

in 2015, discussion continued 
surrounding the use of cameras, as 
many activists say that policy does 
not go far enough. Austin McCoy, 

a Rackham student with the 
grassroots activist organization 
Ann Arbor to Ferguson, said he has 
seen no evidence of progress from 
the police.

“We don’t know if the police are 

using them yet, we don’t know if 
the police is undergoing diversity 
training,” McCoy said. “We just 
know that it was announced a long 
time ago.”

Ann Arbor to Ferguson was 

created 
after 
Rosser’s 
death, 

aiming to fight for justice of 
Rosser’s death in the spirit of the 
protests in Ferguson, Mo., where 
a Black man was shot by police in 
2014.

City Council’s Human Rights 

Commission announced in January 
it would explore the creation of a 
Civilian Police Oversight Board 
to review police conduct. In 
September, Council unanimously 
approved a proposal to grant the 
Human Rights Commission the 
authority to review individual 
discrimination complaints brought 
forth by residents. As of now, there 
is no explicit Civilian Oversight 
Board.

Also this year, John Seto, former 

AAPD police chief, announced 
his retirement andaccepted a role 
as director of the University’s 
Housing 
Security 
and 
Safety 

Services.

A question for many, like McCoy, 

is how City Council will address 
police-community interaction in 
the coming year, especially with 
the new Police Chief James White. 
McCoy said it’s been difficult for 
the Ann Arbor to Ferguson group 
to hold conversations in Ann Arbor 
about these issues.

“In terms of Aura Rosser’s 

killing specifically, folks have 
been able to rationalize it,” McCoy 
said. “They say there’s only been 
one shooting in the last 30 years, 
this was a mistake. Ann Arbor is 
typically seen as a progressive, 
small city. Then it’s like, with all 
these sorts of discourses around 
the city circulating, raising the 
issue becomes a little tough. There 
are people who just believe that 
this is an anomaly and that there’s 
not really a problem.”

McCoy said he hopes that White 

will enter his role with context of 
the Rosser shooting in mind.

“We would hope from any 

new police chief here would first 
be an acknowledgement of what 
happened last year with Aura 
Rosser and the shooting,” McCoy 
said. “We also want to see that the 
police chief has done some studies 
on police-community relations, 
especially as it pertains to people of 
color in this city.”

Among questions from those 

like 
McCoy, 
several 
council 

members said they believe White is 
well positioned for the job.

“Chief White has experience 

working with a civilian review 
board in Detroit, so I think he’ll be 
very useful to help us navigate that 
process,” Warpehoski said. 

“Moving forward, we need 

to work so that we have a very 
comprehensive look at race and 
policing, and really incorporating 
a commitment to that into our 
training 
and 
processes 
and 

programs,” Warpehoski said.

Councilmember 
Chip 
Smith 

(D–Ward 5) said he is confident in 
White’s ability to take on the role of 
police chief.

“The new chief was selected 

largely because he’s been a leader in 
the police community interactions 
in Detroit,” Smith said. “They were 
fraught with a lot more issues than 
we were. I’m really excited to see 
the new ideas he brings in and I do 
think there will be a considerable 
push to have the police be more a 
part of our community.”

Pedestrian safety and 

transportation

In early 2014, City Council 

designated a citizen-led task force, 
dubbed the Pedestrian Safety and 
Access Task Force, to research and 
produce recommendations to City 
Council in regard to pedestrian 
and cyclist safety in the city.

In August 2015, the task force 

released a 59-page report, detailing 
the causes of accidents involving 
pedestrians in Ann Arbor. The 
report also provided dozens of 
recommendations and suggestions 
regarding crosswalks, sidewalks 
and roads.

In September, the task force 

presented the report and its 
findings to the council in awork 
session. They unveiled Vision 
Zero — an initiative that strives 
to eliminate fatalities or serious 
injuries to pedestrians.

The study found that crashes 

involving 
pedestrians 
only 

represented about 16 percent of all 
crashes in Ann Arbor. However, 
pedestrians account for one-third 
of the fatalities and one-fourth of 
all serious crash-related injuries. 
It also noted a 22-percent increase 
of pedestrian crashes per year over 
the five-year period 2010-2014.

In an October meeting, the 

council voted to adopt the Vision 
Zero initiative and made it an 
official city goal to have zero 
traffic-related fatalities by 2025.

Despite the adoption of Vision 

Zero, Smith said there is a long 
way to go before he will be satisfied 
with pedestrian safety in the city. 
He said City Council needs to 
reevaluate how they are budgeting 
for pedestrian safety.

“We 
allocated 
$115,000 
to 

implement the recommendations 
of the Pedestrian Safety Task 
Force,” Smith said. “That’s the cost 
of one rectangular flashing beacon. 
This doesn’t reflect what people 
want here.”

Smith said he hopes that council 

will continue to work on improving 
these issues through 2016.

“We’ve had two cyclist deaths 

in the last month,” Smith said. 
“You never want tragedy to define 
policy solutions that your city 
develops. However, what these 
two tragedies say to me is that we 
have a need in Ann Arbor for non-
motorized infrastructure. As we 
look forward to how do we create 
better conditions for walkers and 
bikers, we have to be able to fund 
those infrastructure ordinances.”

Deer cull

Winter is looking dreary for 

the deer population of Ann Arbor. 
Council voted in September to 
implement a deer management 
program. Then, in November, 
the 
council 
agreed 
to 
hire 

sharpshooters to carry out a 
deer cull. The cull — or selective 
reduction of wild animals — 
was implemented in hopes of 
controlling the deer population in 
Ann Arbor. The cull is set to begin 
in January 2016. Whether deer 
will be killed on campus property 
remains unclear.

Surprisingly to many council 

members, 
the 
cull 
received 

significant 
uproar 
in 
the 

community. At an early November 
council meeting, roughly 200 
people filled the council chambers 
to provide input on the cull.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Sabra 

Sanzotta also decided to take 
matters into her own hands. 
Last Monday, she filed a petition 
to recall Councilmember Kirk 
Westphal (D–Ward 2) due to his 
vote in support of the plan.

If the petition receives 1,791 

signatures from registered 2nd 
Ward voters, this would force a 
special May runoff election ahead 
of the August primary.

Warpehoski said the deer cull 

has been a significant challenge for 
the council in the past year.

“The deer cull has been the most 

controversial issue we have faced 
this year,” Warpehoski said.

Many community members felt 

that the cull was a violent solution 
or that the deer population did not 
pose a threat to the community. 
However, not everyone was against 
the cull; some residents attended 
the November council meeting to 
express their support.

Council will continue to see 

the effects of the cull into the 
coming year and re-evaluate how 
to further address the influx deer 
population in Ann Arbor.

Smith said he hopes Ann Arbor 

will begin to address different 
issues in 2016 and move on from 
the deer cull.

“It disappoints me as a resident 

of this community, that if you were 
to ask me what the biggest story of 
2015 was, it would be the deer cull,” 
Smith said. “We have so many 
other issues: pedestrian and bicycle 
safety, the ongoing discussion of 
police community relationships, 
several high level city people at 
the city leaving. People are going 
to look back at 2015 as the year 
that the deer debate dominated 
everything.”

Housing affordability

Housing affordability in Ann 

Arbor has also been a hot topict this 
year. Throughout the year, several 
different housing plans have come 
forward for debate..

In 
January, 
council 
began 

discussing 
accessory 
dwelling 

units. Accessory dwelling units are 
located within a home’s interior or 
serve as a new addition to a home. 
The council began to discuss 
loosening the city restrictions on 
accessory dwelling units to allow 
for more of them.

In February, council approved a 

new set of affordable housing goals, 
committing the city to work with 
other partners in creating nearly 
2,800 affordable housing units by 
2035.

In August, council voted to 

amend the 2015-16 budget to 
provide 
additional 
funds 
for 

affordable housing in Ann Arbor. 
They 
allocated 
an 
additional 

$450,000 
toward 
improving 

and expanding the supply of 
affordable housing in the city. 
This gave the Ann Arbor Housing 
Commission money to use toward 
the demolition and redevelopment 
for 64 new apartments.

In other development-related 

decisions, 
council 
considered 

several other housing projects 
and re-zoning ordinances. Among 
the largely discussed were the 
properties on State Street south 
of the Stadium Boulevard bridges, 
which received final approval at 
a September meeting. The new 
apartments will offer affordable 
rates to households earning 60 
percent or less of the area median 
income. Tenants will pay rents 
equal to 30 percent of their income.

In 2016, council will continue 

working toward the goal of making 
rent in Ann Arbor cheaper. Smith 
said he hopes affordable housing 
will be a top priority for council.

“Our budgeting process needs 

to be improved and it needs to be 
reflective of what our priorities 
are,” he said. “It’s a wants versus 
needs; we need affordable housing 
in order to be a sustainable 

community.”

Smith said that finding the 

resources 
and 
allocations 
to 

achieve the 20-year goal will be 
difficult.

“For us, nearly 3,000 units 

doesn’t sound like that much, but 
when we’re barely doing 20 units 
a year, it’s a big deal,” he said. “We 
need to find interested partners 
and put our money where our 
mouth is.”
Timeliness of council meetings

Council meetings are known 

for running late into the night, 
keeping city staff and council 
members in council chambers into 
early Tuesday morning. Though no 
significant changes will be made to 
the agenda format in the coming 
year, a few changes are under 
consideration.

Warpehoski and Councilmember 

Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) proposed a 
change to thecouncil’s set of rules. A 
section of the agenda, new business, 
usually consists of a non-contested 
itinerary of resolutions proposed 
by city staff. Typically, items of new 
business concerning staff are voted 
11-0 with little discussion. Grand 
and Warpehoski said they wanted 
to move the section to the beginning 
in sake of the city staff’s time.

“By putting them at the end of 

the meeting, staff or people that 
have something to do with that 
resolution are sometimes there 
until 11 p.m., midnight, 1 a.m. in 
the morning to be ready to answer 
questions about an agenda item 
that we don’t even talk about at the 
end,” Warpehoski said.

The 
council 
approved 
the 

new set of rules on Monday in a 
unanimous vote. New business will 
now come before consent agenda 
and ordinance readings. City staff 
involved in the ordinances would 
then be able to leave after their 
responsibilities were fulfilled.

“We weren’t running meetings 

in a way that is optimal to staff,” 
Grand said. “We almost uniformly 
vote on (staff-related proposals) 
unanimously, with little or no 
discussion. Staff has been staying 
until the end of our meetings, 
which often go until very late into 
the night, instead of being home 
with their families, or doing just 
about anything else.”

Ackerman, who started as a 

council member in November, said 
he felt that council had not been 
working efficiently as a team.

“As a body, they weren’t working 

collaboratively enough,” Ackerman 
said. “There has to be a basic 
understanding that we all want 
to see a healthy and vibrant Ann 
Arbor. The approaches might be 
different, but at the end of the day 
we should be operating in mutual 
respect and collaboration.”

Laboratory 
and 
Research 
Safety 

Committee.

Sheen said there are various other 

committees that address specific 
safety concerns, but there previously 
wasn’t one designed to investigate 
general 
safety 
in 
research 
and 

academic labs.

The 
policy 
explains 
that 
the 

committee 
will 
function 
much 

like 
other 
University 
oversight 

committees, such as the Institutional 
Biosafety Committee or the University 
Committee on Use and Care of 
Animals. Committee members will 
monitor how well laboratories adhere 
to the policy, and serve as liaisons 
between unit safety committees that 
work with academic laboratories.

The 
committee, 
composed 
of 

faculty and staff, will review incidents 
and concerns regarding safe practices 
in labs and research, and amend 
policies where necessary.

The best advice

W

ith 
the 
semester 

coming to a close and 
most 
everyone 
on 

campus nearing 
some 
sort 
of 

breakdown over 
their finals, I, as 
an eternal font 
of wisdom, felt it 
was appropriate 
to expound upon 
some of the best 
advice and the 
most 
important 

things 
I’ve 

learned so far.

To begin with, 

what you look like in pictures isn’t a 
reflection on what you actually look 
like, and even if it was, it doesn’t 
matter. A while ago I was looking 
through old pictures with my mom 
and we found what must be the 
worst picture of myself that has 
ever been taken. It’s from middle 
school and it’s just horrible: the 
lighting is bad, the angle is weird, 
and my position is just incredibly 
awkward and unflattering. My mom 
went to skip past the picture to save 
me some embarrassment, cringing 
on my behalf, but I stopped her so 
I could laugh at it. It was so ugly it 
was hilarious. If there was anything 
at all to be embarrassed about in 
this situation, it was probably how 
hard and long I was able to keep 
laughing at it.

A few years ago I would have 

had a very different reaction to 
that picture, but through a mix of 
positive self-esteem practices (like 
smiling at myself in the mirror, 
inflating my ego to unknown heights, 
some major plastic surgery and the 
adoption of a new identity) I got over 
my aversion to looking at pictures 
of myself. I no longer so closely 

associate my appearance with who 
I am as a person or my value. What 
you look like has no bearing on 
your worth as an individual, so stop 
untagging yourself in your friends’ 
 

Facebook pictures.

The second piece of knowledge 

I have to impart is that dogs are 
the most important thing. Just, 
in 
general. 
Hands 
down. 
No 
 

dispute possible.

Next, no one knows what they’re 

doing, even if they appear to or if 
they claim to have a plan. All of us 
are making it up as we go along. 
I recently got involved with the 
planning of MHacks, and while the 
other planners have quite a bit of 
experience and the event is going to 
be amazing, I get 
the 
impression 

that it’s all an 
experiment 
in 
sinking 
or 

swimming in the 
best way possible. 
The 
sky’s 
the 

limit and there’s 
basically no one 
to tell us no (except the fire marshal 
sometimes). In fact, the amount of 
freedom that we have here is almost 
overwhelming and it makes me 
wonder if this is what it would be like 
to be a man. (But really, the MHacks 
event is going to be amazing.) 

Another point: Call your favorite 

person tonight and thank them for 
being the best. Expressing gratitude 
has been linked to well-being, so it’s 
to both your benefit when you call 
your mom to thank her for fielding 
your ridiculous phone calls about 
how to get nacho stains out of 
sheets, you terrific piece of chaos.

But really, how great are dogs?
Finally, happiness is a choice, and 

you deserve to have it. Recently, I 

had a pretty miserable day featuring 
some poor grades and some stressful 
paper writing. But on the same day, 
I also received some free cider and 
cookies and I remembered the name 
of the song that had been plaguing 
me all week. I made the decision that 
this was actually a good day after all, 
and it was.

At the same time, I do realize that 

this is a huge oversimplification, 
and that there are some challenges 
and miseries in people’s lives that 
are insurmountable. I will say, 
though, that happiness is relative, 
and if you can find one good thing 
to focus on, you can get through 
just about anything.

Plus, if you feel that nothing in 

your 
life 
brings 

you joy, then you 
deserve better. If 
your 
significant 

other 
makes 

you miserable, if 
you’re not thrilled 
with what you’re 
studying 
or 
if 

you’re bored with 

your Netflix queue, then it’s your 
responsibility to yourself to try 
something new. It’s never too late 
to change directions, meet someone 
new, refocus on what actually 
interests you and have confidence 
to throw yourself into situations 
that challenge what you’ve assumed 
about yourself, others or the world. 
We’re all wrong about something.

So, in conclusion: You’re going to 

pass your finals, you’re very pretty 
and smart, you’re not falling behind 
your peers and it’s never too late 
for you. Also, dogs exemplify all 
goodness in the world.

Food vs. figure

“I 

really wanna lose three pounds.”

You’ve heard it before, from 

Regina George, from your best 

friend, your mom, your sister, 
your girlfriend, etc. Most 
teenage girls are thinking 
it, because even those who 
are at a healthy body weight 
feel the need to be thinner. 
Throughout 
my 
teenage 
years, 
I 
have 

grappled with this issue. I’m torn between 
telling myself, ‘You are beautiful the way you 
are, you don’t need to change,’ and wishing 
my stomach was a little flatter, my thighs a 
 little narrower.

According to Harper’s Bazaar, the 2015 

body ideal is more unattainable than ever. 
Where women used to try to be as thin as 
possible, like Kate Moss or Twiggy, we are now 
reaching for a whole new level of impossible. 
There’s the thigh gap, the big butt and the flat 
abs. Unless you are Beyoncé and have more 
money and time than Jim Harbaugh — who I 
guess has a lot of money but not a lot of time — 
this look is nearly impossible to achieve. Most 
women either have the 
curves or the flat stomach. 
Sometimes neither, but 
rarely both. And if, by 
genetics, you are blessed 
to look this way, I won’t lie 
to you, I’m envious.

As a woman, I can’t 

deny that I obsess over 
how I look. This comes 
in many perverse ways 
because sometimes I think, “Should I not 
wear makeup to show people that I don’t 
care too much?” I eat cookies and then feel 
guilty. And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty 
because the radical feminist in me wants me 
to love myself the way I am.

I know I am not the only girl who feels this 

sentiment. My roommate mentioned to me 
that she was trying to lose weight the other 
day, and I immediately responded that she 
doesn’t need to. This reaction was not only 
because I’m an excellent friend (clearly), but 
also because I genuinely believe it. She is, in 
my eyes, tall, beautiful and thin. However, 
this isn’t how she sees herself. We’re taught 
to constantly try to be thinner, prettier, tan-

ner if you’re white, lighter if you’re a person 
of color. This is a problem for everyone, but 
seems to be especially prevalent for women.

With the issue of dieting and obsessing over 

body weight comes the “I love food” complex. 
Yes, everyone loves food, especially sweets 
and carbs and other things that we shouldn’t 
dare touch to our lips, but we talk about it way 
too much.

“I don’t get how people diet all the time, like 

I just love food so much.”

Have you ever heard a girl say this to you? 

This conversation, in my opinion, is nearly as 
damaging as the “I wanna lose three pounds” 
conversation. Sometimes, it feels competitive: 
I love food even more than you! I Instagram 
it day and night! Does that mean you have a 
healthy relationship with it? Does that mean 
you are happy with your body? Probably not.

Obviously, there’s nothing wrong with 

enjoying food, or Instagramming it, but this 
doesn’t mean we must constantly discuss it. It 
often seems girls are trying to cover up their 
lack of eating by reminding everyone how 
much they love food.

This 
isn’t 
only 
a 

conversation we’re having 
with our peers: I grew up in 
a household saturated with 
talk of weight loss. This 
was a toxic environment 
for me. When I’m home I 
feel embarrassed to eat a 
lot because I know multiple 
eyes 
are 
watching 
me. 

“Don’t eat that” is a phrase 

that gets thrown around. My body image has 
gotten significantly healthier since arriving 
in Ann Arbor, a few hundred miles away from 
home. I always attributed this to my all-girls 
high school that was rampant with eating 
disorders, but my home kitchen was nearly 
as bad. For most of us, this is inescapable. 
Whether it comes from our friends, our moms, 
the media or even just ourselves, the pressure 
to look a certain way is everywhere.

To seek out any sort of help related to 

disordered eating on campus, you can visit 
University Health Services.

SCHALOP

I

’m not one to sit still. When 
I was young, I was always 
getting in trouble for playing 

under the table 
at 
restaurants, 

hiding on the 
playground 
at 

recess after it 
was over and, 
of course, never 
staying 
seated 

in school, but 
instead running 
around 
and 

leaving 
the 

wreckage 
of 

a 
tornado 
in 
 

my wake.

At the age of 6, my family 

nicknamed me “the cannon ball” 
because I would throw myself down 
the ski hills of Vermont in my bright, 
all-red snowsuit, crouching as low 
as I could in order to gain as much 
speed as possible before inevitably 
crashing 
into 
something 
(or 

someone) near the bottom. Starting 
in first grade, my parents tried 4 a.m. 
figure skating lessons to “tire me 
out” before going to school, hoping 
to give my teachers some relief. 
Needless to say, it didn’t do much.

Still, to this day, it’s unlikely for me 

to walk down an empty hall without 
doing a few cartwheels along the 
way. Studying in locations such as 
the UGLi and the Reference Room 
physically pains me because they’re 
too quiet, and I can’t move around as 
I would like. My friend Noah likes to 
joke that I do my best studying upside 
down: in a handstand or hanging 
off my chair. If I’m not physically 
moving at the gym or elsewhere, 
you can almost guarantee I’m busy 
somewhere else: in a meeting, 
running 
errands, 
practically 

anything but sitting still.

Business is what keeps me going, 

which is why sometimes I forget 
to take the time to relax. To be 
completely honest, if I had a night 
with absolutely nothing to do — 
no classes to attend, obligations to 
fulfill, exams to study for, papers 
to write or events to plan — I 
wouldn’t have a clue how to spend 
it. Fortunately for me, and the 
countless other college students 
who I expect may feel the same, 
there are actually studies on this.

What 
exactly 
is 
the 
correct 
method 
 

of relaxation?

If you took a poll of the ways 

in which college students choose 
to unwind, I have no doubt that 
the words “going out” (two words 
that seem overwhelmingly normal 

when in reality they describe a 
very abnormal drinking culture) 
and “Netflix” would be high on 
the list. Though I’m not opposed 
to spending nights with friends or 
binge watching my latest TV-series 
obsession, 
Netflix 
and 
chilling 

are not very effective methods of 
relaxation (technically speaking). 
College students turn to late nights of 
one or the other in order to unwind, 
when in reality, nights of staring at 
a blue-light ridden screen and binge 
drinking are doing more harm than 
good. Nope. Not relaxation.

Sports psychologists and other 

scientists 
have 
done 
endless 

research on “the perfect relaxation 
method,” 
usually 
ending 
with 

the promotion of some 10-letter-
acronym recuperation technique 
that can be used to put the mind 
at ease and prepare for the task 
at hand. Some practices include 
“staring at your own eyebrows in 
the mirror and telling yourself ‘I can 
do this,’ ” or the lesser known yet 
just as effective “downloading-a-
yoga-app-onto-
my-phone-and-
bruising-myself-
on-my-dorm-
room-furniture-
to-the-sound-
of-chirping-
crickets.”

I’ll pass for 

now.

Assuming 
I 

come out of finals 
week alive and with my sanity, I 
hope to take what relaxation time I 
have and put it to better use. It will 
be tempting over Winter Break to 
do nothing but hibernate in my bed, 
catching up on sleep and TV shows. 
It will be even more difficult when 
three weeks later, the whole cycle 
repeats: school will resume, and my 
free time will dwindle to nothing.

Though 
some 
relaxation 

techniques are time consuming 
— exercise, yoga or that weird 
eyebrow-staring method — there 
are also a number of smaller things 
that can be done on a regular basis 
to promote relaxation, most of 
which revolve around increasing a 
sense of presence.

Focused-attention 
meditation, 

which may benefit college students 
in particular, simply encourages 
individuals to pay close attention to 
one’s activities in the moment with 
undivided 
attention. 
Observing 

without judgment is easier said 
than done, and includes not just 
inhibiting judgment of others, but 

self-judgment as well.

Personally, I can’t remember the 

last time I ate, and just ate, without 
my phone, computer, homework 
or with another person to talk 
to. As I said, slowing down isn’t 
 

my specialty.

Countless other methods have 

been 
experimentally 
proven 
to 

benefit individuals who partake 
in meditative activities. With the 
implementation of transcendental 
meditation in schools, the David 
Lynch Foundation found a 21-percent 
increase in high school graduation 
rate, 10-percent improvement on 
test scores and GPA, increased 
attendance, decreased suspensions 
and a “40-percent reduction in 
psychological 
distress, 
including 

stress, anxiety and depression.”

Additionally, 
the 
foundation 

reports benefits to veterans, includ-
ing a 40- to 55-percent decrease 
in symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress disorder and depression, 
42-percent decrease in insomnia, a 
47-percent reduced risk of cardio-

vascular-related 
mortality 
and 

a 
30-percent 

increase in sat-
isfaction 
with 

quality of life. 
In an interesting 
study on telom-
erase 
activity, 

individuals who 
attended a medi-
tation 
retreat 

expressed higher concentration of 
telomerase (an enzyme that repairs 
the protective caps on the ends 
of chromosomes; shortening of 
these caps is associated with old-
age) than those who didn’t attend 
 

the retreat. 

For someone who can barely find 

time to eat and sleep, let alone go on 
a week-long retreat, smaller, more 
consistent doses of meditation 
and mindfulness may be a more 
effective way to relax. Though 
I’ve grown out of my bright-red 
ski snowsuit, I know I’ll continue 
to cannonball through my time 
here at Michigan, and probably 
even accelerate wherever I end up 
after. The proof is in the research. 
But practicing mindfulness and 
relaxation can be more difficult 
in stressful situations. The irony 
is that the busier I get, the more 
desperately I need the time to relax.

Finals week, anyone?

2015 Season Review: Quarterbacks

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Editor’s 
Note: 
With 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2015 
regular season in the books, 
the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2016. In this edition: 
quarterbacks.

Jim Harbaugh, a former 

Michigan and NFL quarterback 
in his own right, arrived to 
coach the Wolverines in his 
first year with quarterback 
as one of the team’s biggest 
question marks.

And as the season went 

along, fifth-year senior Jake 
Rudock provided as positive an 
answer as Michigan could have 
hoped for.

Rudock came as a graduate 

transfer 
from 
Iowa, 
where 

he started for two seasons, 
throwing 
for 
4,819 
yards, 

34 
touchdowns 
and 
18 

interceptions. 
In 
August, 

he emerged from a crowded 
quarterback competition after 
beating out junior Shane Morris 
and redshirt freshman Wilton 
Speight, among others.

Initially, he was seen as a 

stand-in. With his one year 
of eligibility, he would come 
in and keep the offense under 
control while the defense, the 
team’s strength, carried the 
Wolverines. The label of “game 
manager” followed him for most 
of the season.

He was successful in that 

role. After a three-interception 
performance 
in 
the 
season-

opening loss at Utah, Rudock 
slowly began to limit his turnovers 
while a dominant defense led 

Michigan to a 5-1 start.

Then, 
the 
Wolverines 

suffered their second loss of 
the season, and they were in 
danger of taking their third 
when Rudock went down with 
an injury Oct. 31 at Minnesota.

At 
that 
point, 
Speight 

provided 
some 
temporary 

relief. Though he struggled 
at times this year, Speight put 
it all together for one gutsy 
comeback drive in Minneapolis. 
He threw the go-ahead 12-yard 

touchdown pass to redshirt 
junior 
wide 
receiver 
Jehu 

Chesson with 4:57 left, helping 
Michigan escape with a win.

Rudock returned to action 

the next week in top form, 
putting together a memorable 
November in which he threw 
for 1,296 yards, 11 touchdowns 
and just two interceptions in 
four games.

His brief Michigan career 

will come to a close Jan. 1 in the 
Citrus Bowl against Florida, but 

he became a valuable asset to 
the Wolverines in his one year.

HIGH POINT: In the first 

half of the season, for the 
most 
part, 
Rudock 
merely 

avoided mistakes. But on Nov. 
14 at Indiana, he helped win 
Michigan the game. That day, 
he threw for 440 yards and a 
school-record six touchdowns 
in a double-overtime, 48-41 win. 
He also carried seven times for 
64 yards.

His experience showed in 

the final moments of the game. 
With 2:52 left in the fourth 
quarter and the Wolverines 
trailing, 34-27, he led an eight-
play, 66-yard drive, culminating 
in a five-yard touchdown pass 
to Chesson with two seconds 
left. In overtime, he threw 
touchdowns on back-to-back 
plays, first a 21-yard toss to 
junior tight end Jake Butt and 
then a 25-yard bomb to redshirt 
junior wide receiver Amara 
Darboh to give the Wolverines 

the lead.

LOW 
POINT: 
Rudock’s 

Michigan career got off to an 
inauspicious start in the season 
opener at Utah. He threw 
three interceptions, including 
one pick-six to provide the 
difference in a 24-17 loss. His 
performance was a surprise 
given that he threw just five 
picks in 2014.

But Rudock quickly recovered, 

never again throwing more than 
one interception in a game.

THE 
FUTURE: 
Next 

season’s situation is promising 
but 
uncertain. 
Rudock’s 

departure will leave a hole 
in the Michigan offense, but 
the cupboard isn’t bare. He is 
questionable to play in the bowl 
game with a shoulder injury, 
perhaps opening the door for 
Speight to gain more experience.

As for next year, Speight will 

return as a redshirt sophomore. 
Junior John O’Korn, a transfer 
from 
Houston 
who 
was 

ineligible this season due to 
NCAA transfer rules, will enter 
the fold. Morris and freshmen 
Zach Gentry and Alex Malzone 
all redshirted this season and 
will be back in action, too. 
Finally, four-star quarterback 
recruit Brandon Peters, the No. 
6 pocket passer in the class of 
2016 according to ESPN.com, 
will be on campus with a chance 
to compete as well.

If last season is any indication, 

Harbaugh could even recruit 
another graduate transfer for 
2016. No quarterback battle 
appears to be too crowded for 
Harbaugh, and as he would say, 
it’s shaping up to be another “fair, 
honest, healthy competition” for 
the job next season.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Fifth-year senior quarterback Jake Rudock improved throughout the season to become one of Michigan’s most valuable assets on offense, finishing with 2,739 yards.

Albrecht balancing 
rehab, game action

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

With time running down in the 

Michigan basketball team’s rout 
of Houston Baptist on Saturday, 
the Wolverines and the Huskies 
scrambled, scrapped and skipped 
into the air to fight for a loose 
ball. A handful of players tipped 
it around the key before it finally 
got deflected toward half-court.

There, senior guard Spike 

Albrecht elevated — his back to 
Michigan’s basket — and rifled 
a two-handed, over-the-head, 
volleyball-like pass to redshirt 
freshman forward D.J. Wilson, 
who was all alone. Wilson took 
one dribble and two steps, then 
dunked.

Not even a week earlier, on the 

last day of November, Michigan 
men’s basketball coach John 
Beilein said that he planned to 
shut 
Albrecht 
down. 
Beilein 

said he was concerned about 
the time it has taken Albrecht to 
rehab from his two hip surgeries 
over the summer, and that for 
the foreseeable future, Albrecht 
would prioritize rehabbing over 
practicing with the team. Despite 
limiting his on-court practice 
time, however, Beilein didn’t rule 
him out from playing in games.

The very next day, when junior 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. left the 
Wolverines’ game against North 

Carolina State in the first half 
because of a foot injury, Beilein 
didn’t hesitate to play Albrecht. 
In five second-half minutes, the 
guard recorded just two statistics 
— a personal foul and an assist — 
but showed that despite still being 
on the mend, he’s capable of being 
on the court in games.

Saturday, 
against 
Houston 

Baptist, 
with 
Walton 
still 

sidelined, Albrecht came off the 
bench again to give sophomore 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman 
— 
who 
replaced 

Walton in the starting lineup 
— some rest. Albrecht recorded 
four assists in 12 minutes in the 
contest, including his acrobatic 
dish to Wilson.

After 
the 
game, 
Albrecht 

admitted he’s still not sure where 
he stands health-wise and what 
the plan is going forward. 

“I don’t really know what’s 

going on,” Albrecht said. “Right 
now we’re kind of just — I’m not 
practicing every day — I’m always 
game ready, though. I’m always 
available to play, but just between 
school, classes and then practice 
for two to three hours, I don’t 
really have a window to go and 
get rehab done for like an hour 
and a half, two hours.”

Given the choice between 

two hours on the floor or two 
hours doing rehab, Beilein and 
Albrecht both said that for now, 

he’ll do rehab.

“It’s kind of like a day-by-day 

thing,” Albrecht said. “Coach 
Beilein and our trainer, Alex 
Wong, get together and help 
game plan for a two- or three-
day period, and I just show up 
wherever I’m supposed to be.”

Not on the stat sheet from 

the game against the Huskies: a 
loose ball Albrecht dove for in the 
second half — hips be damned.

“I’ve been playing like that 

since I was 7 years old,” Albrecht 
said. “I’m not going to change the 
way I play.”

Walton was on the bench again 

when Michigan went to Southern 
Methodist 
on 
Tuesday, 
but 

Beilein opted to play Albrecht for 
just three minutes in the first half.

In eight games this season, 

Albrecht is averaging fewer than 
nine minutes per game. Last year, 
with injuries to Walton and senior 
guard Caris LeVert, Albrecht was 
forced to take on a larger role. He 
averaged 32 minutes per game 
and started 18 contests.

Physical ability aside right 

now, Beilein stressed he wants 
Albrecht on the court given his 
experience. The senior has played 
in more games than anyone else 
on the roster.

“We need his head out there,” 

Beilein said. “We need his 
brains out there as much as we 
can have it.”

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Senior guard Spike Albrecht has played in eight games this year even as he recovers from two offseason hip surgeries.

Line changes spark explosion for ‘M’

Kile, Nieves, 

Selman unite to 
form powerful 

second line

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

Two weeks ago, after the 

No. 9 Michigan hockey team 
played a weekend series against 
Dartmouth, 
the 
Wolverines 

switched up their top two lines.

Junior forward Alex Kile 

moved to a line with senior 
forwards 
Boo 
Nieves 
and 

Justin Selman, while freshman 
forward Kyle Connor joined 
junior forwards JT Compher 
and Tyler Motte.

And it worked.
Michigan scored 12 goals this 

weekend, and the top two lines 
were involved in nine of them.

“The coaches saw something 

that even us players didn’t 
notice,” Selman said. “It’s just 
that little tweak, that one player, 
that one kind of thing, which 
opened up the scoring for both 
of the lines.”

More importantly, Selman’s 

line, which had scored just three 
goals in the last six games, found 
its scoring spark once again.

Friday, Selman scored the 

goal to tie up the game at four, 
and Connor scored an empty-
net goal to finish off the Badgers.

But the line felt they were 

clicking, and it showed early 
Saturday night.

Just 1:29 into the game, 

Selman found himself wide 
open in the left circle and fired 
the puck at the Wisconsin 
net. Badger goaltender Matt 
Jurusik made the initial save but 
couldn’t corral the rebound, and 
Nieves was able to put the puck 
away to put Michigan up early.

Selman gave a lot of credit 

on the goal to his new linemate, 
Kile, who made the cross-ice 
pass to Selman to start the goal-
scoring play.

“(Kile’s) a really, really skilled 

player and makes some great 
plays,” Selman said. “On Boo’s 
goal, that first one, he made a 
great pass and hit me coming 
down the ice. He’s really skilled, 
he’s easy to play with. He’s 
physical too, so he plays really 
hard on both ends.”

But the trio wasn’t finished.

Just three minutes later, the 

line went on the penalty kill. 
Once again, Nieves and Selman 
found themselves on an odd man 
rush. But this time, Selman took 
the initial shot and cleaned up 
the rebound to 
put Michigan 
up 
by 
two 

goals less than 
five 
minutes 

into the game.

The 
line 

also scored the 
Wolverines’ 
third goal of 
the night when 
Selman again 
finished 
off 

a play, putting Michigan up by 
one after Wisconsin tied back 
up the game at two.

“(The adjustment period) was 

maybe two drills in practice,” 
Selman said. “We kind of even 
said like ‘Wow, we’re kind of 
gelling pretty good.’ I think 
we found chemistry through 

the weekend, and we kind 
of expected to have a good 
weekend after making some 
good plays earlier in the week.”

But Selman noted that while 

on the stat sheet the change 

seemed 
to 

make 
a 
big 

difference, 
there 
wasn’t 

much 
of 
a 

difference 
between Kile 
and Connor.

“Kile plays 

a 
similar 

game to Kyle 
Connor,” 
Selman 
said. 

“He is that skilled, crafty, shifty-
type forward mentality.

“I can’t really put my finger 

on 
the 
difference 
between 

(Connor and Kile), but they’re 
both really, really good players.”

For Kile, though, playing on a 

line with Nieves and Selman was 
a little different than his old line.

“On Motte and JT’s line, I 

was waiting for the puck to 
come to me,” Kile said. “They’re 
two players who like to grind 
in the corners and work for the 
puck. Playing with Boo, he adds 
a little bit of speed. I like to try 
to keep up with him. I’ve always 
liked playing with fast players.”

Even after the statistical 

success of his newly minted 
lines, 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson 
wasn’t 
completely 

pleased with them after the 
game.

“I can’t say I didn’t like them, 

but I can’t say I did like them,” 
Berenson said after Friday’s 
game. “I thought it was a real 
scramble of a game.”

But even if Berenson wasn’t 

completely pleased with his 
new lines, the changes brought 
offensive success.

And with a big series against 

Minnesota 
coming 
up, 
the 

Wolverines will take scoring 
anywhere they can get it.

Results mixed for Flaherty

Sophomore scores 
33 at Princeton, 
improving on last 
trip to home state

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Sunday’s loss to Princeton may 

have been the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s first game of 
the 2015-16 season outside the 
state of Michigan, but Katelynn 
Flaherty enjoyed having a home 
crowd of her own.

The Point Pleasant, N.J., 

native returned to the Garden 
State for the second time in her 
career and scored 33 points — 
the second-most in her career 
— in the Wolverines’ 74-57 loss.

With 
family 
and 
friends 

in the stands, Flaherty was 
determined to put on a better 
show than in her previous 
appearance in her home state.

In last year’s visit to Rutgers, 

the then-freshman laid an egg, 
shooting 1-for-5 from the field 
and finishing the night with 
just four points off the bench. 
It was one of Flaherty’s worst 
performances in the season she 
was named Big Ten Sixth Player 
of the Year.

This time around, Flaherty 

impressed everyone in Jadwin 
Gymnasium 
at 
Princeton. 

Despite being double-teamed 
and physically challenged, the 
sophomore stepped up and put 
on one of the best performances 
of her career.

“It shows how much I’ve 

grown since freshman year,” 
Flaherty said. “I think coming 
back was much more of an 
enjoyable experience this year, 
just because I’m more confident 
and more into the flow of the 
game. I had a lot of fun playing 
this year compared to last year 
when I was more nervous.”

But Flaherty wanted not just 

to put on a memorable individual 
game, but help her team earn a 
signature win.

Her 33-point night wasn’t 

enough to lift the Wolverines 
past the Tigers, who sit just 
outside the top 25 in this week’s 

polls. Outside of Flaherty’s 11 
made field goals, Michigan 
shot 25 percent from the field, 
and no other scorer reached 
double digits.

Flaherty’s zero assists and zero 

rebounds added to a frustrating 
night for the Wolverines. Besides 
her point tally, the sophomore 
accumulated just two other 
statistics — two steals and four 
turnovers.

It looked like the rest of the 

team was struggling in ways 
Flaherty did in her first trip 
back home against the Scarlet 
Knights, especially freshman 
guards 
Nicole 
Munger 
and 

Boogie Brozoski — who were 
also making homecoming trips.

Munger and Brozoski — from 

Doylestown, Pa. and the Bronx, 
N.Y., respectively — showed 
their freshman inexperience and 
struggled in their first trip back 
to the Northeast in performances 
similar to Flaherty’s last January 
in Piscataway.

The freshmen combined to 

shoot 1-for-6 and turned the ball 
over five times in 27 minutes on 

the court.

Now, 
having 
shown 
she 

can 
personally 
handle 
the 

homecoming, 
Flaherty 
will 

have to take on a new challenge 
before the Wolverines return in 
February to take on Rutgers in 
their regular-season finale.

The 
amount 
of 
regional 

high-school accolades between 
Flaherty, Munger and Brozoski 
can’t be counted on one hand, 
but the number of wins in the 
Northeast for Michigan can’t be 
counted at all.

It’s up to Flaherty to change 

that. If she can help her 
teammates make the leap she’s 
made between her two trips 
home, then come February, the 
Wolverines likely have what it 
takes for the current group to 
earn its first win in New Jersey.

“Katelynn cares about the 

team first,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “She knows 
she’s going to need to be able to 
have nights like that. We need 
to get everyone on the team 
involved for us to be successful 
as well.”

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Junior forward Alex Kile moved to a line with Boo Nieves and Justin Selman, and the results were overwhelmingly positive.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Katelynn Flaherty scored 33 points in her return to her home state Sunday.

“The coaches saw 

something that 
even us players 
didn’t notice.”

A Long Time Ago in a Family 

Room Far, Far Away …

I remember the first time I 

watched 
“Star 
Wars.” 
Sitting 

among the rows of white, plastic-
shelled Disney movies and sing-
a-long tapes that no doubt drove 
my parents slightly insane was the 
black-bound VHS boxed set of the 
original trilogy: “A New Hope,” 
“The Empire Strikes Back” and 
“Return of the Jedi.” They were 
an alluring alternative compared 
to the brightly illustrated cartoons 
that I regularly watched. Summon-
ing the courage, I asked my mom if 
I could watch one of them.

“Only if you watch them with 

Dad,” Mom said, still fighting to 
preserve my wide-eyed innocence.

So I waited impatiently until 

my dad came home from work. I 
asked him to watch it with me, and 
thankfully he agreed.

Oddly 
enough, 
I 
watched 

“Return of the Jedi” first. Sure, plot 
details were lost in my young mind, 
but I was enthralled as a small band 
of heroes triumphed over an intim-
idating Empire, two black-caped 
villains and a giant slug. There 
were laser guns, spaceships and the 
iconic lightsabers — everything my 
young heart could desire.

Over several viewings, I learned 

the names of these heroes and vil-
lains. I’ve watched the growth of 
Luke Skywalker from farm boy to 
Jedi, the romance between Prin-
cess Leia and Han Solo and the 
final redemption of Darth Vader 
more times than I can remem-
ber. The creator, George Lucas, 
became an idol along with his col-
laborators, including University 
alum Lawrence Kasdan, the writ-
er of “The Empire Strikes Back” 
and “Return of the Jedi.”

The series remains a timeless, 

cultural landmark, even as it must 
withstand aging and a disappoint-
ing prequel trilogy. Now with 
Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm in 
2012, a new wave of “Star Wars” 
films approaches, beginning with 
the upcoming release of the sev-
enth installment, “Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens.”

An industry perspective
“The 
big 
thing 
everybody 

points to in ‘Star Wars’ is that it’s 
modern myth,” said Oliver Thorn-
ton, a Screen Arts and Cultures 
lecturer. “It’s a story, even when 
we teach screenwriting here at 

the University, that’s the univer-
sal point of reference that every-
body knows. If you want to talk 
about the ‘Hero’s Journey,’ we can 
always say at the end of the day, 
30-some years later that most stu-
dents have that frame of reference 
of Luke Skywalker and that first 
basic journey he goes through.” 

Sitting down for an interview 

with the Daily, Thornton elaborat-
ed on the appeal of “Hero’s Jour-
ney,” outlined by Joseph Campbell.

“I think there’s just something 

about that story, about that basic 
hero of somebody who’s a nobody 
who ends up being a somebody and 
ends up heeding the call of adven-
ture,” Thornton explained. “It’s 
universal and that’s why kids love 
it and why we continue to go to it.” 

On the sixth floor of North Quad 

— a few feet from Thornton’s room 
— is the office of fellow lecturer 
Dan Shere, who echoed Thornton’s 
statement in a separate interview.

“I think that George Lucas, in 

the originals especially, tapped into 
something very deep in the human 
psyche,” Shere said. “He created 
stories that are enduring precisely 
because they sort of follow this 
mythic structure. It follows the 
same story template you see from 
the Bible to Greek mythology and 
he put a new twist on it and infused 
that age-old tem-
plate with this 
brilliant creativ-
ity of his.”

That 
creativ-

ity, according to 
Shere, 
spawns 

from the marry-
ing of the fantastic 
future with the 
ancient past into 
something oddly 
recognizable.

“They gave us a vision,” Shere 

said. “Even though it’s a galaxy 
that’s far, far away, we’re dealing 
with futuristic technology, which 
is this incredible fantasy world. 
We as kids, and even adults, want 
to be able to get in a spaceship and 
zoom into a galaxy far away and 
yet the spaceship itself is really 
like an old, beat-up Chevy. The 
Millennium Falcon is both futur-
istic and cool, but also completely 
familiar because it’s always break-
ing down and Han Solo and Chew-
bacca always have their tools and 
are always working on it. So it’s 
at once forward looking and also 
completely familiar as this arche-
type, and I think that’s overall 
what the films did well.”

Shere’s career is closely inter-

twined with “Star Wars,” thanks 
to a short film made early in his 
career.

“The year, I believe, was 1999 

and I was just freshly graduated 
from the University of Michigan,” 
Shere said. “I moved out to Los 
Angeles and lived with my good 
friend Joe Nussbaum, who had just 
graduated from USC film school, 
and he was an aspiring director 
and looking to get his start in the 
industry by making a short film, 
and he had a little bit of money 
saved away and was looking for 
an idea for a short film. So he and 
another friend came up with this 
idea, ‘George Lucas in Love.’ At the 
time in ’99 we were all anxiously 
awaiting the first of the prequels 
and then also ‘Shakespeare in Love’ 
had just won some awards, it was 
popular at the time. It just all kind 
of clicked and once he brought me 
that title, we sat together and kind 
of brainstormed a six, seven min-
ute short film that would describe 
a young George Lucas in 1967 as a 
film student at USC trying to write 
his thesis screenplay and he’s got 
terrible writer’s block.”

Over the course of the film, a 

young Lucas draws inspiration 
from around his college campus, 
including a girl who “leads the stu-

dent rebellion,” 
a 
pot-smoking 

roommate who 
rants 
about 
a 

mystical 
force 

and a guy who’s 
always 
trying 

to fix his Chevy 
with the help of 
his 
incredibly 

hairy friend, all 
of whom serve as 
predecessors to 

Lucas’s classic characters.

“We really crammed as many 

little ‘Star Wars’ references into 
seven minutes as we could and 
I think we did a pretty good job 
at it,” Shere said. “And definitely 
‘Star Wars’ fans have appreciated it 
throughout the years.” 

Moving into his professional 

career, Shere drew inspiration 
from the series that captivated him 
at a young age, especially when 
working on the 2013 film “Epic.”

“I had this scene where the 

good guys steal the uniforms of 
the bad guys in order to infiltrate 
their evil lair,” Shere said. “And 
I was reminded really quickly by 
my friend, ‘Oh you mean just like 
how Han Solo and Luke dress up

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 2015 is coming to a close 

and The Weeknd had his best 
year yet, musically. He had two 
number-ones, 
a 
sold-out 

arena 
tour 

and has been 
nominated 
for 
Record 

of the Year 
(“Can’t 
Feel 

My 
Face”) 

and Album of 
The Year (Beauty Behind The 
Madness) — but more than that, 
the Canadian R&B star now has 
a brand. The Weeknd’s brand 
is sleek, sexy, a little danger-
ous and a whole lot of fun. His 
newest music video “Into The 
Night” is a continuation of that 
brand.

The Weeknd plays opposite 

current-girlfriend Bella Hadid 
in a gangster love story complete 
with strip clubs, assassinations, 
slit throats and mass amounts 
of sexual tension. The song 

explores dark themes of sexual 
abuse and sex work. Hadid per-
forms as a young woman under 
the thumb of a ruthless gang, as 
The Weeknd yearns to help her 
out of her detrimental situation. 
The music video climaxes as 
the Weeknd feels a gun pointed 
at the back of his head in the 
hands of the gang’s leader. Just 
as viewers come to grips with 
the death of the video’s protag-
onist, “Into The Night” twists 
the narrative as a bullet punc-

tures the back of the gangster’s 
head. Hadid emerges from an 
abandoned building and the 
two ride off “Into The Night” 
on a motorcycle.

The video’s plot isn’t pioneer-

ing, but with the MJ-inspired 
sound, tangibile content and 
trippy imagery, paired with the 
failure to paint Hadid as a dam-
sel in distress, the video adds 
one more success under the 
Weeknd’s year.

Rain or snow, the 
one true love of my 
life never fails to 

bring what I require

By CAROLINE FILIPS 

Daily Arts Writer

Of all the men I have loved 

and lost, there is one to whom 
I’m forever indebted. Between 
his charm, charity and coy 
shrug that always follows my 
expressions 
of 
gratitude, 
I 

cannot fathom a more suitable 
suitor. 

Here’s looking at you, Mr. 

Delivery Man — my one true 
love.

It’s strange to feel you’ve 

cracked the code that’s crippled 
the curious and puzzled poets 
for lifetimes, centuries, rainy 
afternoons, etc. Since the first 
savages of this Earth subsisted 
on a Paleo diet before peak 
trendiness, 
some 
force 
has 

driven us heathens together — 
science says it’s for procreation, 
I say it’s for the euphoria of 
seeing 
him 
standing 
there, 

deadpanned gaze, logo-bearing 
hat, cardboard box in hand.

Though 
I’m 
certain 
that 

ours is the love of a lifetime, 
it wasn’t always that of fast-
food fairytale. Before college, 
friends spoke highly of him, yet 
he and I seldom crossed paths. 
I only called when I pined for 
pepperoni, when I ached to 
have my arteries clogged. But 
as college began last fall and the 
temperatures plummeted the 
following winter, I needed him 
more than ever.

And now, here he is, knocking 

at my door.

His eccentricity never ceases 

to amaze me. Unlike the other 
boys who ask their dads how to 
shop for women, he’s known all 
along. His insight is remarkable 
— all too often, there he is, 
static and slouched, holding the 
universe together — with extra 
cheese, no less.

And, 
though 
his 
actions 

speak louder than his words, he 
knows what to say when I’m at 
my worst.

“Sign here, please,” he says. 

Cue the dopamine.

When I just can’t bear the 

outside world or brave the 
elements, he does the opposite. 
Just last week, he endured the 
snow and the wind and the 
deathly cold — by bike, by bike 
— all to bring me fried rice. 
I know, right, he’s a moment 
maker! How lucky am I to have 
found The One so young? And 
still in my pajamas!

He keeps our love alive even 

through the most trying of 
times. During finals week, when 
I want nothing more than a quick 
exchange of cash for carbs, he’s 
there to balance my emotions 
with his emotionlessness.

“Here’s your sandwich,” he 

says, blank as ever, passing the 
torch. He gives, I take. I smile, 
he frowns. It’s perfect.

He’s the trustiest of steeds 

and the only phone call I look 
forward 
to. 
Unlike 
routine 

check-ins with mom, he doesn’t 
ask the hard questions. With 
him, it’s never about my GPA, 
just my needs. He’s there to ease 
the troubles and so graciously 
take orders.

When 
I 
overanalyze 
our 

interactions, I realize the one-
sidedness of our relationship. I 
put in zero effort, but for some 
reason he keeps coming back 
for more — with more food. I 
literally just call his name — 
whatever his name is that day — 
and he’s there in 45 minutes or 
less. God, he’s so agreeable.

So yeah, my only intimacies 

are accidental — the last time a 
guy touched me was when Mr. 
Delivery Man handed over the 
goods and grazed my hand. I 
tipped big.

My midnight booty call isn’t 

a booty call at all — it’s a speed 
dial to Pizza House. And when 
my hotline blings, bae doesn’t 
arrive, a pizza does. I know what 
you’re thinking, it’s too good to 
be true. But it’s not all serotonin 
and Szechuan chicken.

As with any great love, the 

doubt seeps in. I can’t see us 
working out long term. Between 
my neediness and his near-
sickening 
devotion, 
natural 

selection will take us out soon 
enough 
(and 
take-out 
will 

prevail). But for now, when my 
relatives ask about the boys in my 
life, I reply honestly. Yes, Aunt 
Barb, there is a man in my life. 
And unlike your ex-husband, he 
consistently delivers.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

VIRGINIA LOZANO/DAILY

Ann Arbor local Connor Kessler looks at the Star Wars books on display at Vault of Midnight. 

“Star Wars” 
hasn’t just 

endured — it 
has thrived. 

How lucky am 
I to have found 

The One so 

young?

in Stormtrooper uniforms on the 
Death Star.’ Even something like 
that which I knew wasn’t directly 
thinking of ‘Star Wars,’ it’s always 
sort of hovering there in the back 
of my mind, influencing on a very 
subliminal level a lot of my cre-
ative instincts.”

“I can’t say everybody, but most 

people from my generation, I feel 
like when you say, ‘Why did you 
go into film or TV or anything 
media related,’ points to ‘Star 
Wars’ when they were little and 
just wanting to do that,” Thornton 
said, reflecting on the widespread 
influence of the series, an experi-
enced shared from one generation 
to another.

“It’s still a good story, but it was 

also this shared cultural experi-
ence from when my generation 
was kids, and now sharing that 
with another generation is a way 
of keeping that experience that 
we had alive. It’s something 
you pass down. ‘Star Wars’ still 
evokes this remembering what it 
was like to be a kid and to go to 
the movies and have this fun and 
innocence. I want my kids to have 
the same thing.”

Entering the vault

“Star 
Wars” 
hasn’t 
just 

endured — it has thrived. With 
the upcoming release date of “The 
Force Awakens” comes numerous 
pieces of additional merchandise 
— comics, books, toys and any 
number of future collectibles.

Few places in Ann Arbor are as 

acquainted with these forms of 
storytelling as Vault of Midnight. 
Located on Main Street in down-
town Ann Arbor, the award-win-
ning store is a local centerpiece 
for geek culture.

Entering the store on a snowy 

Sunday morning, I randomly 
browsed the rows of comic books, 
graphic novels, action figures and 
clothing. Though wide open in 
space, the Vault is chock full of the 
latest entertainment and issues 
from a wide variety of publishers.

I walked to the register and 

the assistant manager, Marcus 
Schwimmer, gave me a more 
guided walk through the store. 
After showing me the all-ages 
material, including cartoonist 
Jeffrey Brown’s popular series, 
“Jedi 
Academy,” 
Schwimmer 

brought me over to Marvel’s lat-
est offering of “Star Wars” mate-
rial. Circling the multi-tiered 
display, Schwimmer gave a brief 
rundown of every series and book 
in sight, the knowledge coming 
effortlessly. A comic grabs his 
attention, “Star Wars: Chew-
bacca.” He grabs the comic and 
carefully opens the 
plastic 

bag that encases it. He mentions 
the artist, Phil Noto.

“The guy was put on this 

planet to draw Chewbacca,” 
Schwimmer said as he showed 
off the artwork. One image shows 
Chewbacca, Han Solo’s Wookiee 
companion, all by himself, lying 
in a field of light pink flowers. The 
character, usually seen in pitched 
battles or letting out his distinc-
tive roar, is at peace in the field. 
It’s hard to argue with Schwim-
mer about Noto’s beautiful art-
work.

My attention was then brought 

to Curtis Sullivan, owner and 
operator of Vault of Midnight. 
Guiding me down into the base-
ment-level game room of the 
Vault, Sullivan, another long-
time fan who claimed to receive 
“Star Wars” toys every birthday 
and Christmas for years after 
seeing “The Empire Strikes Back” 
for the first time in theaters, sat 
down for an interview.

“Comics and ‘Star Wars’ have 

a long, awesome history and most 
recently Disney bought Lucas-
film,” Sullivan said. “Disney 
also owns Marvel Comics, the 
original publisher of ‘Star Wars’ 
comics way back when it started. 
Marvel now has the ‘Star Wars’ 
license again for comics and it’s 
a really great homecoming. They 
have ran with it and made the 
best ‘Star Wars’ comics in my 
time of reading ‘Star Wars’ com-
ics, which is 30-plus years. It’s the 
best time to be a reader of ‘Star 
Wars’ comics.”

In explaining the “Star Wars” 

universe to me, Sullivan clari-
fied the somewhat complicated 
nature of the “Star Wars” canon, 
which already had an expansive 
set of stories and histories known 
as the Expanded Universe.

“This 
Expanded 
Universe 

is now referred to as Legends, 
it’s not canon proper,” Sullivan 
explained. “But, everything we 
have now from Marvel, ‘Star 
Wars’ and the new novels is now 
canon proper. Until who knows 
when they reboot it. Most of our 
readers in our store are just look-
ing for a good ‘Star Wars’ story. I 
know you got some die-hard fans 
who will talk about every stitch 
and every piece of clothing, but 
a lot of people we talk to or sell 
comics to are cool with a good 
‘Star Wars’ story and aren’t wor-
ried that it fits every nook and 
cranny that they think is estab-
lished canon.”

And now is the perfect time 

to find those “Star Wars” stories, 
according to Sullivan, who reit-
erated the consistent strength of 

Marvel’s latest series of comics 
that fill in the gaps between the 
original trilogy films.

“They expand, they go in 

between the movies and they are 
also leading us into ‘Force Awak-
ens,’ ” Sullivan said. “So there’s a 
great book (‘Shattered Empires’) 
right now, that just wrapped up 
that takes us to the end of ‘Return 
of the Jedi’ right into ‘Force 
Awakens.’ So it fills in all these 
great gaps and they’ve hired the 
top talents in the industry to do 
this, they spared no expense cre-
atively. So the writers and the art 
teams on these books are the best 
in the business.”

From Phil Noto to other artists 

like Salvador Larroca, who illus-
trates the “Darth Vader” series, 
Marvel has enlisted some of the 
most exciting comic book talents, 
including writers like Mark Waid 
and Charles Soule who wrote 
series about Princess Leia and 
Lando Calrissian, respectively. 
Sullivan also mentioned Jason 
Aaron, an author he claims is, “one 
of the best writers of all of comics,” 
and also helms the comic series 
known simply as “Star Wars,” a 
personal favorite of Sullivan’s.

“Every book they’ve put out 

has been a world-class writer 
and a world-class artist and just 
the best in the biz, not cheap, 
page-rate employees,” Sullivan 
said. “They seem like considered 
editorial decisions like, ‘Who is 
the good writer to do this book?’ 
they’re not just grabbing a big 
name for the sake of ‘Oh this, 
is a popular writer.’ It feels like 
they’ve selected the right people 
for each project.”

Speculating on the popular-

ity of these series, Sullivan could 
only see growth in the future.

“ ‘Star Wars’ fever is kooky 

right now, it’s very high,” Sulli-
van said. “But I don’t think we’ve 
begun to see the beginning of 
‘Star Wars’ fever. Let’s talk about 
this again the week after the 
movie releases. I think it will be 
inescapable.”

In the meantime, Sullivan will 

keep selling comics and waiting 
for the release of the next film in 
a series that has touched so many.

“The last trailer for ‘Force 

Awakens,’ like many people, I 
was damn near crying watching 
the trailer,” Sullivan said. “I just 
thought that it invoked all the 
feelings that are bigger than ‘Star 
Wars.’ It’s bigger than lightsabers 
and spaceships. It’s a feeling you 
get when you hear the music and 
the sound effects and the charac-
ters. I just can’t wait.”

LEFT TO RIGHT: Brad Hales, Robert Wells and Breck Bunce spin classic soul records at the Blind Pig.

Monthly event has 

devoted underground 

following

By RACHEL KERR 

Daily Arts Writer

Don’t come yet, a message on 

my phone reads at 10:04 p.m. I’m 
sitting in an Uber outside of the 
Blind Pig. It’s empty, the next 
message says.

“Shit.”
My friend and I shimmy out of 

the Uber. We’re supposed to be 
meeting another friend, whom 
the messages are from, inside the 
venue for something called the 
“Ann Arbor Soul Club.”

“It’s an event we started 

coming up on nine years ago. 
There was a University grad 
student named Robert Wells, and 
he suggested the idea of doing a 
night out here,” said Brad Hales, 
owner of Peoples Records in 
Detroit and co-founder of the 
event that occurs on the first 
Friday of every month. “Basically, 
it’s like a European style night, 
where DJs seek out these obscure 
records that were never played 
on the radio. They weren’t 
commercially 
successful, 
and 

they’re really hard to find. (We 
don’t play) the soul music that 
Americans grew up on the radio 
with.”

It’s 10:37 now. We’re eating 

ice cream. We’re staring at our 
phones. We’re trying to kill 
time. We’re deciding when we 
should go.

“From 9:30, when we begin, 

until about 11, when people tend 
to arrive en masse, we can play 
ballads and earlier ’60s R&B 
stuff to set the mood and kind of 
get things started,” Hales said. 
Seems we’re right on time then. 

As we shuffle into the venue 

at 10:45, with the masses Hales 
described, 
I’m 
aggressively 

reminded of my underaged-ness 
when they mark me those fateful 
Ms (for minor!). But I continue on, 
unaffected. The Bling Pig, if you 
haven’t been, is intimate; the space 
holds only a bar, a couple circle 
tables, a dance floor and a small 

stage. On that stage, the DJs are 
busy spinning, only a few beers and 
a collection of 45s with them.

“(We have guest DJs) nearly 

every other month or third month. 
Soul music DJs and fans from 
around the globe often travel here, 
and the night can be a fun stop for 
them. We’ve had friends visit and 
spin from mostly the UK, but also 
Germany and Switzerland, as well 
as many from all over the States,” 
Hales said.

Tonight, it’s Nick Soule from 

the Windy City Soul Club in 
Chicago, playing with resident 
DJ Breck T. Bunce. Hales usually 
DJs, too, but couldn’t because of 
a persistent illness. Around the 
bar stand a few 40-somethings, 
but the dance floor is almost 
exclusively full of college-aged 
students.

“When we started, the night 

definitely got more townies and 
people that I had known from 
living there in the mid-’90s. Now 
none of them show up. It’s all 
younger students,” Hales said. 
“You can tell they’re there for 
the first time if they’re saying, 
‘Hey, I don’t know if you take 
requests, but are you going to 
play Al Green?’ ”

These students seem to know 

exactly 
what 
they’re 
doing, 

though, swinging and jiving and 
grooving (and any other dated 
dance term I can use here) to 
the song playing. But, I have no 
idea how to dance to soul music. 
Our generation has been trained 
to just, like, bump and grind on 
things. Introduce rhythm into 
the equation and it gets tricky. 
So my friends and I stand off to 
the side at first, observing that, 
contrary to Hales’ observation, 
there are in fact some “townies” 
sprinkled among the students: 
the group of lumberjack-looking 
men drinking IPAs, the old 
woman 
wearing 
sunglasses 

inside, the singular 70 year old 
drinking whiskey.

When we finally make our way 

onto the dance floor, the moves 
begin to ooze out of us. Limbs 
brush against one another, hairs 
fall out of place, sweat drips 
from foreheads. But we don’t 

care because the music is fun. 
Not until I hear “Get Ready” by 
The Temptations, recognizable 
only because Fergie has sampled 
it, do I realize this music is also 
incredibly significant: It helped 
create most of today’s sounds.

“I grew up hearing rap music 

and wondering what it was made 
from, those little samples they 
got, where those original sounds 
were from. Growing up hearing 
that kind of thing led me down a 
path to older music,” Hales said.

And he didn’t have to look 

much further than the greater 
Metro Detroit area, birthplace of 
Berry Gordy’s Motown Records. 
Arguably the most significant 
movement in soul music, Detroit 
soul introduced the world to 
the infectious tunes of The 
Supremes, the melodic styling 
of The Temptations, the sensual 
vocals of Marvin Gaye and the 
all-around revolutionary music-
making of Stevie Wonder. When 
Motown Records moved to Los 
Angeles in 1973, Detroit’s soul 
seemed to leave with it. The Ann 
Arbor Soul Club just wants to 
help us find it again. 

“Our state served as a cultural 

organ donor for the rest of the 
world,” 
Hales 
said. 
“People 

here threw it away, and people 
elsewhere embraced it and kind 
of saved it from the trash bin of 
time. So I think it’s extremely 
important that we do represent 
our area and give that kind of 
night a presence. You should 
hear it here. It’s from here. 
People should definitely learn 
about it.”

We leave the Bling Pig at 

12:30 a.m., sweating and smiling, 
aware that something great just 
happened though not sure quite 
what. Students continue filing 
into the venue, bringing with 
them both the soul and spirit 
that both the music and the city 
need for revival.

Check out Peoples Record’s 

website for more soul sounds: 
http://peoplesdetroit.com/. Hales 
also suggests you watch the movie 
“Northern Soul,” now available on 
Netflix, to give the Ann Arbor Soul 
Club some context.

TRAILER REVIEW

Paramount’s 
“The 
Big 

Short” trailer is reminiscent of 
the “The Wolf of Wall Street” 
trailer in that it’s deceptively 
glamorous — 
casually cut-
ting to images 
of semi-nude 
strippers 
and 
$20 

bills floating 
everywhere. 
The people in 
these trailers 
really 
need 

to invest in 
rubber bands. This is a movie 
about the economy collapsing, 
right? 

This is probably the whit-

est movie trailer of all time. 
It cuts to the core of the basic 
khaki-wearing, Ruby Tues-
day-going 
Caucasian 
male 

fantasy of wearing nice suits, 

playing golf and spending time 
with tall, skinny blonde girls. 
It’s not that I dislike movies 
with lots of slick white guys 
in them on principle (though 
I really hated the woefully 
insincere “Black Mass”), this 
just seems like a pretty egre-
gious pleasure-show aimed at 
a painfully specific audience. 

The “clock ticking” motif of 

the trailer’s music is a bit on-
the-nose thematically, but it 
provides an alright structure 
in which to present the film’s 
aesthetic. I can’t say I’m not 
excited to see this movie — 
though its cast is pretty hor-
rendously milquetoast, you 
can’t deny their talent.

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

“Prodigal: New and Selected 

Poems, 1976 to 2014” collects 
the best work from English 
Prof. Linda Gregerson’s long 
and successful career in poetry. 
The book collects poems from 
nearly 40 years of published 
work, which has appeared in 
magazines such as The New 
Yorker and Poetry and in 
books, including her National 
Book Award Finalist “Magnetic 
North.”

However, Gregerson, who 

is also director of the Helen 
Zell Writers Program, didn’t 
begin her career as a poet. 
Instead, after graduating from 
Oberlin College, she lacked a 
thorough sense of purpose and 
wasn’t sure what to do. A love 
for learning sent her into a 
PhD program at Northwestern 
University where she studied 
Shakespeare, but after a bit of 
scholarly work, she decided 
to pursue theater. Working 
in theater, coincidentally, led 
her to write poetry between 
periods of production.

“During 
those 
between 

times, I was writing to really 
keep myself going, and decided 
I really needed some proper 
training because I’d never taken 
a creative writing course in my 
life, ever,” Gregerson said. “So, 
I’d had the good fortune to 
publish some poems. When I 
applied, miraculously I got into 
the top programs I applied to 
and decided to go to Iowa. But 
I always had it in my head to go 
back and do the PhD.”

After her time at the Iowa 

Writers’ Workshop, where she 
worked with notable poets 
such as Louise Glück, Donald 
Justice and Bill Matthews, 
she 
considered 
returning 

to 
Northwestern. 
But 
the 

academic 
environment 
had 

changed from when she was 
there, so she followed other 
paths, ending up at Stanford 
University.

During her initial PhD work 

at Stanford, she thought she 
would focus on 20th century 
American lyric poetry, such as 
the work of Wallace Stevens 
and John Ashbery. But the 
theater lured her back. She 
changed 
her 
dissertation 

work to Renaissance drama. 
However — once again — a sea 
change: the Renaissance epic 
drew her in.

While 
Gregerson 
has 

studied the master poets — 

Shakespeare, 
Milton, 
Eliot, 

etc. — and learned much from 
them, her work reading poem 
submissions at The Atlantic 
during the 1980s was crucial 
in her development. Poetic 
missteps provided as much 
insight 
as 
the 
triumphs. 

Although 
the 
monthly 

magazine only published about 
two poems a month, Gregerson 
read all submissions — she 
estimates that she read nearly 
60,000 poems a year.

Gregerson’s career as a poet 

took off when she discovered/
invented her own stanzaic 
form, which all of the poems 
in her collections “The Woman 
Who Died in Her Sleep” and 
“Waterborne” 
follow. 
With 

variations, the form is a tercet 
with five, two and four metrical 
feet.

“It was really crucial. I began 

writing this sort of default 
form when I was in my MFA 
program. Virtually everyone 
was writing stanzas that were 
flush left. That’s just what 
poems looked like. And so they 
were stanzas I think of as block 
stanzas,” Gregerson said. “I 
needed something more jagged 
that had some asymmetry in 
it, some spin that had more 
resistance to syntax building, 
and more syncopation. I played 
around a lot, and I finally 
evolved that tercet, which it had 
the lines differ both because 
they’re 
differently 
indented 

and because they’re different 
lengths. It was a godsend. It 
gave me patterns of resistance. 
It gave me momentum. It gave 
me syncopation.”

Gregerson’s poetry displays 

a magnificent sense of detail 
and an ability to navigate 
between scales. In the title 
poem, “Prodigal,” Gregerson 
shifts between the local and 
the cosmic. The body of a 
young 
girl, 
with 
bountiful 

copper hair, is both the flesh 
of the individual and a text 
for human life. The girl cuts 
herself, and the lacerations on 
her skin are a “many-layered 

hieroglyphic / raw, half healed, 
reopened.” These inscriptions 
are a metaphor for the ways in 
which human life constantly 
transfigures — and pollutes 
— the natural world. Here, 
the personal is the ecological, 
too, and Gregerson shows her 
adroit ability to negotiate and 
examine the particular and the 
general at the same time.

Her poetry, too, revels in the 

minute profundity of existence 
and exhibits a wonder for the 
natural world.

“I continue to be amazed by 

embodiment,” she said. “I’m 
amazed by living in a body. The 
brilliance of the biosphere — I 
can’t get over it. I am stunned 
at 
the 
intelligence 
quite 

separate from us. The part we 
do on purpose seems so trivial 
to what is done on our behalf by 
everything.”

“The Bad Physician,” from 

her collection “The Woman 
Who 
Died 
in 
Her 
Sleep,” 

examines the genius of the 
body and the cellular processes 
that both maintain and destroy 
human life. Gregerson writes, 
“even in error the body / wields 
cunning.” But the machinations 
of biology are indifferent to 
human life. They don’t care 
if we live or die. It is this 
tension, between the horror 
and beauty of the life process, 
that motivates the poem to its 
brilliant conclusion:

“The beautiful cells dividing 

have

 no mind

 for us, but look

 

what a ravishing mind

 they make

 and what a heart we’ve 

nursed

 

in its shade, who love

 that most

 which leaves us most 

behind.”

Gregerson said that there are 

only two themes — love and death. 
They’re themes that her poems 
confront with fear and wonder. 
Many have confronted these 
themes before and many will do so 
in the future, but few have done so 
as well as Linda Gregerson.

SINGLE REVIEW

Layers upon layers of tex-

tured, dripping sound culmi-
nate in a funky yet daunting net 
to create Detroit-based Omar 
S’s newest sin-
gle, “The Lost 
Albatross.” The 
missing 
alba-

tross mentioned 
in the title could 
refer to many 
aspects of the 
track — mainly 
its impossible-
to-pin-down 
melodic progression. Just when 
you think you have figured out 
the 
different, 
synth-soaked 

elements and how they work 
together, Omar S switches up the 
composition, throwing listeners 
through a continual loop.

The beats and melodies build 

continually upon each other, 
easing in and out of the fore-
front to allow one or the other to 
shine. The melody moves from 
non-existent to a whisper in the 
background to the most promi-
nent aspect of the piece only 
to once again be swallowed by 
some scratchy synth beats. The 

piece is both modern and retro, 
playing on the synth style of the 
’80s while questioning its own 
place in current music. Despite 
its 
constant 
compositional 

change, “The Lost Albatross” 
consistently submerges listeners 
in waves of complex, grooving 
sound.

D

ear Gillian,

There is a boy — a 

very cute, smart and 

well-dressed boy in my class. 
While I would normally go for 
it consider-
ing these 
attributes, 
he’s also got 
that, “I’m 
top-tier and 
super-intim-
idating” 
swagger. 
How do I 
approach 
this? Star-
ing lustfully 
across the room is not going so 
well. We have had absolutely no 
contact and he hasn’t expressed 
any interest, but there just seems 
to be something there (am I 
crazy?).

 – Drooling From Across The 

Room

Dear Drooling,
Crazy? You mean just 

because you believe in a 
romance between you and 
someone who doesn’t know you 
exist? Yes, you might be crazy, 
but not in a bad way. Let’s start 
with some lyrics. Here are 
the opening lines from Alicia 
Keyes’ “You Don’t Know My 
Name,” which does mention 

“crazy:” (The music video is 
everything you’d hope for from 
a early 2000’s production.)

From the day I saw you
Really, really wanted to catch 

your eye

Somethin’ special ‘bout you
I must really like you
’Cause not a lot of guys are 

worth my time

Oh baby, baby, baby
It’s gettin’ kind of crazy
’Cause you are taking over my 

mind

And it feels like ooh
You don’t know my name
And here’s Antônio Carlos 

Jobim’s “The Girl from Ipane-
ma,” a hit in the ’60s and one 
of the most covered songs in 
the 50 years since — there’s a 
great, soulful Amy Winehouse 
version:

Oh, but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart 

gladly

But each day as she walks to 

the sea

She looks straight ahead, not 

at me

Tall and tan and young and 

lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes 

walking

And when she passes, I smile, 

but she

Doesn’t see. She just doesn’t see

But don’t feel too crazy, 

Drools, because you and your 
boy are precisely where every 
single love affair in the history 
of the world began — brimming 
with private passion and ooz-
ing with pure potential, but 
otherwise, nowhere. You are 
the secret admirer, like Shake-
speare’s Viola in “Twelfth 
Night,” cloaked in a pretend 
disinterest. The question is how 
to de-cloak.

First of all, don’t let the 

top-tier swagger dissuade you. 
From Psyche’s betrothal to a 
supposed monster (actually 
Cupid in disguise, but not the 
point … ) to Ron and Herm-
ione’s romance that overcomes 
her towering superiority in 
potions class and everywhere 
else, love often deals in non-
superficial traits — charm, 
sincerity, perseverance and 
humor are surely among them, 
but they are innumerable. Your 

challenge will be to summon 
your strengths, your most 
attractive qualities, and get 
them into his view. How do you 
approach this, you ask?

You don’t have to be the 

Daily’s liberal arts advice 
columnist to know that you 
and Swaggy, although you’ve 
never spoken, have something 
obvious in common: the class! 
I’ll get to the point of this in a 
moment, but first, a couple of 
words of caution.

Drools, this might not work, 

so give it your all, but don’t 
get obsessed. Don’t cling like 
Velcro to a couple of passing 
smiles like the protagonist Pro-
fessor Gustav von Aschenbach 
in Thomas Mann’s “Death in 
Venice.” He becomes erotically 
obsessed with a beautiful young 
boy, and stays in Venice stalk-
ing the lad despite the Cholera 
epidemic, of which he becomes 
a statistic. In the critically 
acclaimed 1975 Francois Truf-
faut film “The Story of Adele 
H.,” Victor Hugo’s daughter 
becomes irrationally obsessed 
with a military officer and does 
some world-class trans-con-
tinental stalking, certain they 
will marry. Of course, he thinks 
she’s a lunatic and she ends up 
spending 40 years in an asylum. 
Point is, erotomaniacal obses-

sion is never a good look and 
always end badly.

As I said, you’re in a good 

place across the room. We often 
imagine love at first sight in 
more grandiose settings, like 
walking along the Seine, rid-
ing a wave in Waikiki, or on 
the steps of a grand museum. 
This sometimes happens. 
Often, however, it’s those we 
see everyday in our apartment 
buildings, regulars at our favor-
ite coffee shops, or like you: in 
class.

“L’Amour de Swann,” one 

section of a larger work by Mar-
cel Proust, details the beauty 
of quotidian, everyday love. 
Charles Swann begins to love 
the mundane things about his 
lover Odette and takes plea-
sure in her everyday rituals 
and actions rather than the 
idealized beauty and glamour 

he used to be attracted to. I 
wouldn’t take this relationship 
as a model, for it proves to be a 
painful projected illusion, but 
Proust brilliantly explores the 
ways in which a person can 
permeate our own day-to-day 
experiences.

So, as long as you remain 

grounded and don’t begin to 
creep around this guy’s life, 
you’ll be good. I’d advise you to 
build an approach around the 
class itself: suggest a pre-finals 
study session or a term paper 
critique swap, or even just ask 
for a day’s notes you may have 
missed. Find a class-centered 
way to start talking to this boy, 
preferably in a cozy coffee shop 
over some lavender-honey lat-
tés, and take it from there. Cra-
zier things have happened.

EPISODE REVIEW

Warning: Our favorite TV 

couple may be splitting up. In 
this week’s midseason finale of 
“The 
Mindy 

Project,” 
new 
parents 

Mindy Lahi-
ri 
(Mindy 

Kaling, “The 
Office”) 
and 

Danny (Chris 
Messina, 
“Vicky Cris-
tina 
Barce-

lona”) have a 
heated argu-
ment 
about 

kids and Mindy’s duty as a 
mother.

Mindy, a successful OB/GYN 

and unconventional mom, isn’t 
one to stay at home with the 
kids. As she explains to Danny, 
the “Peanuts” kids are growing 
up just fine without the con-
stant supervision of adults. But 
Danny takes a different view: 

“Charlie Brown’s 10 years old 
and he’s bald and he has no 
friends. Yeah, he’s doing fine.”

There are other bones to pick 

between the two parents, too, 
like the fact that Mindy still 
owns a private million-dollar 
apartment, though she spends 

most of her time with Danny 
and Leo. Complaining, Danny 
swings low by saying that the 

Virgin Mary, perhaps the most 
famous mother of all, didn’t have 
a separate apartment in West 
Village. Mindy snaps back, “If 
Mary had an apartment as cool 

as mine, she probably wouldn’t 
have been a virgin.”

Jokes 
aside, 
a 
reflective 

Mindy enters a flashback of 
the couple’s first meeting at 
Shulman and Associates, very 
“When Harry Met Sally”-esque. 
Revisiting 
their 
uncomfort-

able first encounters and their 
mutual loathing of each other 
in the months that followed, 
Mindy is able to again see the 
flaws in Danny, but also how 
they overcame their arguments: 
like when Mindy insists that she 
move a giant armoire into her 
new office and Danny agrees 
that if it fits, it’s meant to be.

Back in the present, a teary-

eyed Mindy brings Leo’s crib to 
her apartment for a test. When 
the crib fits in the room, Mindy 
takes down the “For Sale” sign 
from outside. Does this mean 
Mindy and Danny are no lon-
ger meant to be?
