Evelyn 
Alsultany, 

admired professor, author, 
advocate, 
mentor 
and 

administrator, 
will 
be 

leaving the roles she has held 
at the University of Michigan 
for over 14 years for a new 
opportunity at the University 
of Southern California in just 
a few days.

Alsultany has played a 

prominent role on campus 
since her days as a student 
in 
the 
1990s. 
Alsultany 

attended 
the 
University 

as an undergrad, attended 
Stanford 
University 
as 

a 
graduate 
student 
and 

returned to the University 
of Michigan as a faculty 
member in 2005.

Now an Arthur F. Thurnau 

professor and an associate 
professor in the Department 
of 
American 
Culture, 

Alsultany’s most significant 

role has been as co-founder 
and 
outgoing 
director 

of the Arab and Muslim 
American Studies program. 
Alsultany 
has 
taught 

courses in the department 
including “From Harems to 
Terrorists: Representing the 
Middle East in Hollywood 
Cinema,” “Introduction to 
Arab 
American 
Studies,” 

“Islamophobia” and “Why Do 
They Hate US?: Perspectives 
on 9/11”.

Throughout her tenure, 

Alsultany has been a leader 
in establishing AMAS — one 
of only three programs in the 
country to focus on Arab-
American identity — and 
collaborating 
with 
others 

to create the Islamophobia 
Working Group — a group 
of students, faculty and staff 
dedicated to advising the 
University administration on 
how to make campus more 
inclusive for those affected 

The University of Michigan 

Senate 
Assembly 
convened 

Monday to discuss affordability, 
equity, sustainability, sexual 
misconduct and free speech on 
campus.

The 
Senate 
Assembly 

planned to vote on a new Faculty 
Senate Secretary and electronic 
voting 
at 
future 
meetings. 

However, with between 60 and 
70 members in attendance and 
a required quorum of 100, they 
were unable to vote, Senate 
Assembly Chair Neil Marsh 
said. As a result, LSA professor 
David 
Potter 
will 
remain 

the interim Faculty Senate 
Secretary.

Marsh then addressed the 

Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs’ interest in 
allowing electronic voting in 
future Senate Assemblies.

“What we would like to be 

able to do is change the rules so 
that we can put forward items of 

concern to the Senate through 
electronic means,” Marsh said.

Electronic voting has been 

the subject of debate for several 
years and is seen as a way to 
facilitate remote participation 
to achieve the necessary to 
quorum to vote on issues 
before the Senate Assembly. 

On Nov. 6, in conjunction 

with the midterm elections, Ann 
Arbor residents voted in favor 
of Proposal A. Prop A called for 
the city charter to be amended 
to require the currently public-
owned Library Lot to remain in 
public hands and to be developed 
into a city park.

Previously, the City Council had 

already voted to sell the Library 
Lot to real estate developer Core 
Spaces for $10 million. $5 million of 
the proceeds from the sale would 
have been dedicated to affordable 
housing efforts in the city.

Core Spaces had planned to 

use the Library Lot to build a 
17-story high-rise with a hotel, 
apartments, office and retail space. 
Additionally, they had planned to 
build a plaza that would be slightly 
bigger than Liberty Plaza.

Mayor Christopher Taylor, who 

had the support of the Downtown 
Development 
Authority, 
the 

Washtenaw Housing Alliance and 
the Ann Arbor District Library for 
the sale, had been against the 
passage of Prop A.

FBI finds ‘U’ second highest in hate 
crimes of universities surveyed

Longtime Arab and Muslim mentor 
leaving the ‘U’ for new position at USC

FBI, UMPD research shows increase in reported incidents in the last several years

The University of Michigan 

has the second highest number 
of reported hate crimes in 
2017 of all universities surveyed 
a recent FBI report found.

The data, obtained from 110 

colleges and universities in the 
United States, both public and 
private, states 15 hate crimes 
were reported at the University 
of Michigan-Ann Arbor right 

behind 25 hate crimes reported 
at 
Rutgers 
University-New 

Brunswick 
in 
New 
Jersey. 

Other area schools, such as 
U-M Dearborn and Michigan 
State University, reported only 
one hate crime.

The FBI report, released 

last month is less holistic 
than the U.S. Department of 
Education’s 
report, 
which 

includes 
hate 
crime 
data 

from all institutions of higher 
education, as required by the 
Clery Act.

The FBI claims hate crimes 

nationally have increased by 
17 percent in 2017, compared 
to the year prior. The data 
indicates a trend where campus 
hate crimes have increased 
substantially since 2016. Nearly 
280 hate crimes were reported 
in 2017 — an increase from the 
257 reported in 2016 and 194 
reported in 2015.

According to the University’s 

Deputy Chief of Police Melissa 
Overton, 
the 
upsurge 
in 

reported hate crimes could also 

indicate that more students are 
familiar with and willing to 
report hate crimes.

“As 
with 
most 
other 

jurisdictions, especially college 
campuses, our numbers started 
to rise dramatically starting in 
2016 due to the larger numbers 
of bias incidents occurring, as 
well as an increased awareness 
and reporting of such incidents 
by our community,” Overton 
said. 
“I 
cannot 
speak 
on 

comparison to other schools.”

The University of Michigan 

released 
revisions 
to 
its 

policies 
on 
student 
sexual 

misconduct 
and 
faculty-

student relationships Monday 
morning. The new regulations 
place a presumptive ban on 
relationships between faculty 
and undergraduate students, 
and cases in which a graduate 
student either works in the 
same department as, or has 
academic oversight over, an 
undergraduate student. 

The policy also now outlines 

processes for student cross-
examinations in the wake of 
a decision made by the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 
that public universities “must 
give the accused student or 
his agent an opportunity to 
cross-examine 
the 
accuser.” 

The University appealed for a 
rehearing after the initial case, 
but their request was denied.

The updates focus on creating 

two avenues for settling cases, 
either 
through 
adaptable 

resolution 
or 
investigative 

resolution. In addition to an

and 
Islamophobic 

incidents on campus.

Alsultany is also known for her book 

“Arabs and Muslims in the Media: Race 
and Representation after 9/11,” published 
in 2012, and for her work co-editing “Arab 
and Arab American Feminisms: Gender, 
Violence, and Belonging” and “Between 
the Middle East and the Americas: The 
Cultural Politics of Diaspora.”

At an event celebrating the scholarship 

of 
Alsultany 
last 
Thursday, 
several 

students, 
colleagues 
and 
faculty 

members spoke about their experiences 
working with Alsultany. Aside from 
her academic accolades, the panelists 
spoke of Alsultany’s work to expand and 
improve campus prayer rooms, her role 
in arranging a closed town hall meeting 
for Middle Eastern, North African and 
Muslim students following the murder of 
three Muslim students at the University of 
North Carolina, Chapel Hill in February 
2015, her advocacy for the ME/NA box to 
be included on all University forms that 
require demographic information, and her 
work in organizing the first Islamophobia 
speak-out.

June Howard, faculty member in 

English, American culture and women’s 
studies, admired Alsultany’s kindness 
and perseverance with these challenging 
topics.

“She is a deeply beloved person here 

at the University of Michigan broadly 
and certainly in the department of 
American Culture and AMAS,” Howard 
said. “Whatever good we do in the future 
because we will be following in Evelyn’s 
footsteps.” 

Marjorie Horton, former assistant dean 

for undergraduate education in LSA, said 
Alsultany has demonstrated expertise 
and commitment to diversity, teaching 
and leadership.

“We all know Evelyn as a professor 

who is truly exceptional in caliber and 
impact of her contributions in all domains 
to our college, the broader campus 
community and nationally, and most 
importantly, to our students individually 
and collectively,” Horton said.

Law student Areeba Jibril said through 

Alsultany’s course, “From Harems to 
Terrorists,” she learned the language she 
needed to address Islamophobia in the 
classroom and in the community.

“I heard so many good things about 

(Alsultany’s course), I was going to save 
it for my senior year and I’m so glad that 
I didn’t, because finally I found a space 
where I could walk in and feel seen.”

Later, Alsultany spoke with The Daily 

about her journey at the University of 
Michigan, and what she’s looking forward 
to in her new post.

TMD: Take us through your journey 

at the University of Michigan. From 
teaching, 
mentoring, 
administrative 

work, advocacy, diversity work and more 
— had you imagined it would be this way, 
and what has been the most rewarding?

The seed was planted when I was 

an undergraduate student here in the 
early 1990s and it was planted through 
the classes that I took in ethnic studies 
and 
women’s 
studies 
that 
I 
found 

transformative 
in 
terms 
of 
how 
I 

understood my own identity in relation 
to the social and political world. So, as 
an Arab American, Muslim American, 
Latina, I had access to Latino studies 
classes that were meaningful to me, but 
in order to learn about Arabs or Muslims, 
a student — which is common at many 
universities — would take Middle East 
studies classes and you’d learn about Arab 
countries. I took Islam 101, and these are 
very important classes, but I was looking 
for something in particular at the time 
and those classes weren’t filling that thing 

I was looking 
for. 
There 

seemed to be a 
gap in terms of 
understanding 
the experiences 
of 
Arabs 
and 

Muslims in the 
U.S. 
context 

and filling that 
gap 
is 
what 

has shaped my 
scholarship 
on 
the 

racialization 
of 
Arabs 
and 

Muslims 
in 

the 
U.S. 
and 

it also shaped 
my 
teaching 

and my service 
work.

I was hired 

here in 2005, 
it 
was 
10 

years 
after 
I 

graduated and I 
never imagined 
that when I left 
here in 1995 I 
would become 
a 
professor. 

I never imagined I would become a 
professor here. I never imagined that I 
would help to build an Arab and Muslim 
American studies program. So, I guess my 
message to undergrads is you really don’t 
know where your future is going to take 
you and especially when you’re graduating 
from here. But I never imagined that I 
would have this incredible opportunity 
to bring my dream to fruition and create 
an Arab and American studies program 
along other ethnic studies units in the 
Department of American Culture and 
also, as I mentioned yesterday [during 
the celebration event], I didn’t do it alone. 
Nadine Naber was a professor here. She 
was hired in 2003. I was hired in 2005. 
She’s now a professor at the University 
of Illinois in Chicago and we had a very 
similar vision and together created what 
the program is today. We created courses, 
internship opportunities, programming, 
we piloted a certificate program that 
eventually led to the minor, which is now 
only one of three of its kind that look at 
Arabs, Middle Easterners and Muslims 
in the U.S. context, and the other two are 
U-M Dearborn and San Francisco State. 
I’ll add that the most rewarding thing has 
been working with students for whom the 
classes and minor are meaningful. There’s 
a synergy that happens between what this 
minor is trying to do, what the classes are 
trying to do and then the students who are 
really looking for that thing. So it’s been 
rewarding to offer learning opportunities 
that will help students thrive in the very 
difficult world that we’re living in, and 
also an academic home for Arab and 
Muslim students on campus, and it’s also 
been very rewarding to work with them 
on creating a more inclusive campus.

TMD: After all this time — both as a 

student and now a faculty member — how 
does it feel to be leaving the University of 
Michigan?

I’ve been going through a grieving 

process, and when I first accepted the job 
at USC, I felt really, really sad. Everyone 
was congratulating me and I … I just felt 
this extreme sense of loss. I had accepted 
this incredible opportunity and I was 
just feeling sad all the time. And when I 
tell people that I felt sad, they would say, 
“Well why don’t you just stay? Just stay. 
Cancel the acceptance and just stay here.” 
But the point is that it’s hard to leave a 
place that’s been so formative to who I 
am and it’s been a place where I’ve — I 
didn’t come here an expert, I became an 
expert in my field, I became the director 
of a program, I grew into some leadership 
positions, I developed my teaching. So 
it’s really hard to leave, especially the 
program that means so much to me, and 
my incredible colleagues and students, 
but I am also proud to leave with the Arab 
and Muslim American studies program 
in such a strong position and to have 
contributed something to this campus 
that some students find meaningful and 
who will be able to continue to benefit 
from it after I leave.

TMD: You’ve been at the University 

through a number of tumultuous and 
challenging times, and students, faculty 
and staff have all cited your strength, your 
advocacy, your willingness to be a mentor 
throughout those times, and of course, 
year-round, too. So what are your primary 
motivations for this work, specifically in 
these particularly challenging times?

In the years that I’ve been here, every 

year, some kind of crisis happens. And I 
think that’s common at college campuses 
across the nation that are reflecting the 
urgent social political issues of our time. 
Over the years, a student would come to 
me with an issue and say something like, 
“We’re

CL A SS OF 2018

leaders, including the incoming 
majority in the City Council, have 
rallied against this development 
and pushed for the passage of 
Prop A. Councilmembers Jack 
Eaton, D-Ward 4, and Anne 
Bannister, 
D-Ward 
1, 
both 

advocated for Prop A.

Bannister, 
who 
had 
filed 

a separate lawsuit against the 
city regarding the sale of the 
Library 
Lot, 
said 
the 
Core 

Spaces development is a luxury 
development when the city needs 
more affordable housing.

“It’s sort of common sense 

that 
building 
more 
luxury 

housing 
is 
not 
getting 
us 

anywhere near growing our 
affordability,” 
Bannister 
said. 

“We, unfortunately, take down a 
lot of out single-housing homes 
and then put up more luxurious 
multi-home units, and then those 
apartments are displaced.”

Bannister 
expressed 

willingness to withdraw her 
lawsuit because Prop A covers a 
lot of its points.

“(My lawyer’s) direction for 

the settlement suggestion was 
that Proposal A has overcome the 
lawsuit on whether the contract 
was valid,” Bannister said. “It’s 
fairly simple that the Proposal A 
has overcome and remedied the 
lawsuit.”

Bannister also said she would 

be willing to move past any 

previous disagreements on Prop 
A.

“Whether 
you 
disagreed 

before the vote, now is the time 
when people have to forget about 
the way who voted which way 
back then, and stress about how 

people go forward,” Bannister 
said.

Eaton, who previously ran an 

unsuccessful primary campaign 
to challenge Taylor earlier this 
year, 
highlighted 
the 
other 

developments moving forward in 
the city.

“We do have other things in 

the works,” Eaton said. “We’re 
looking at how to develop the Y 
Lot. We should be able to leverage 
the property we have to develop 
affordable housing… The fact that 
we didn’t build that one building 
is not going to have an impact on 
affordability in general.”

Regarding 
Core 
Spaces’s 

ability to take legal action against 
the city for nulling the previous 
sale agreement, Eaton expressed 
little concern.

“Section 16 says the city 

can walk away from the deal if 
legislation is passed against it,” 
Eaton said. “Proposal A is that 
legislation. If there isn’t a valid 
contract, they don’t have grounds 
for suit. Even if they were to 
file suit, they have minimum 
damages.”

Alternatively, Councilmember 

Chip Smith, D-Ward 5, expressed 
his continued opposition to Prop 
A. For Smith, his opposition for 
Prop A was based in the benefits 
that the city would reap from the 
Core Spaces development.

“We would be getting $5 

million for affordable housing, 
we have no money for that right 
now,” Smith said. “We would be 
getting a 1,200 square foot plaza.”

Smith also focused on the 

financial side of Prop A, bringing 
up the potential tax revenue that 
the city was losing by passing the 
proposition and the park’s over 
$10 million price tag.

“I think we lose out as a 

community and as a downtown 
in $2 million per year in tax 
revenue,” Smith said. “We still 
have a structural deficit of 1 to 
3 percent every year… I’d be 
stunned if there was funding for 
the park in the next year’s budget. 
If the Prop A people are honest, 
and if they look at the price per 
square foot for the park, the price 
is extraordinary.”

Office for Institutional Equity 
investigator, a case manager 
from the Office for Student 
Conflict Resolution will be 
present when meeting with 
either one of the students 
involved 
in 
the 
dispute. 

The case manager will also 
serve as the main contact 
for both parties, while the 
OIE investigator will still be 
the individual tasked with 
operating 
the 
investigation 

itself. The changes will be put 
into place beginning Jan. 9. 

In order to comply with the 

Sixth Circuit’s decision, the 
new policy also includes an 
option for students to question 
both each other and additional 
supplementary 
witnesses 

in in-person hearings. The 
hearing officer will also be 
permitted to question relevant 
parties.

LSA freshman Kirsten Lam 

said she felt the changers could 
make the reporting process 
more difficult and intimidating 
for survivors.

“I think that’s a terrible idea. 

That could cause trauma, like 
PTSD is a very real thing for 
sexual assault victims, so just 
even seeing the person, hearing 
that voice, can just trigger the 
bad memory of the whole even 
happening and cause more 
emotional distress,” Lam said. 
“With conversations, people 
can use that to convince the 
accuser to back down and drop 

the charges, because after 
that happens, a lot of people 
are already in an emotionally 
distressed state.”

Students will additionally 

no longer be able to appeal 
decisions on the basis of 
insufficient evidence.

In 
an 
interview 
with 

The Michigan Daily at the 
beginning 
of 
December, 

President Mark Schlissel said 
he felt the OIE had a difficult 
job, but did it well. He did, 
however, also say he was 
worried about how the new 
Sixth Circuit driven changes 
to 
the 
misconduct 
policy 

would impact students going 
forward.

“I think the OIE has a very 

difficult job to do across a 
very challenging landscape … I 
think they do a very good job 
in aggregate,” Schlissel said. 
“The biggest thing I’m worried 
about is we know misconduct is 
underreported, and what we’re 
concerned about is changes we 
make in light of the court 
ruling may impose even more 
challenge around reporting 
… We need to do everything 
we can in the context of this 
legal limitation to support 
students that come forward 
with claims of misconduct to 
hopefully make sure they still 
feel comfortable.”

In conjunction with changes 

to 
the 
sexual 
misconduct 

policy, the University has also 
updated its policy on faculty 
and student relationships.

advocating for a multicultural 
lounge. Can you come with us 
to a meeting with V.P. Harper?” 
And I say, sure I’ll come to the 
meeting. Or, students came to 
me and said, “We’re receiving 
hate mail because of this 
American Sniper controversy. 
We’re having a meeting with 
President 
Schlissel 
— 
will 

you come?” Sure, I’ll come 
with you. “We’re advocating 
for a ME/NA box — a Middle 
Eastern/North 
African 

identity checkbox, and will 
you come with us to meet 
with Rob Sellers or Provost 
Philbert?” So a lot of the 
work I’ve done on campus 
has been through students 
asking 
me 
to 
accompany 

them to meetings that they 
are having. I see myself as an 
advocate for Arab, Muslim 
students, 
ME/NA-identified 

students, who are often not 
part of diversity, equity and 
inclusion conversations. So my 
motivation has been to help 
create an environment at the 
University for marginalized 
students 
to 
thrive 
and 

therefore, reach their potential 
in life.

TMD: How have you seen 

the University climate change 
throughout your career here, 
and 
with 
current 
political 

and social climate, what are 
your feelings for the future? 
Do you feel the University is 
inching toward where it needs 

to be to make this an equitable 
space for students who are 
marginalized, and what do 
you see as further spaces for 
improvement?

I have witnessed that the 

University is committed to 
diversity in many ways, and 
they have been for a long time. 
When I was an undergrad 
here, I remember the Race and 
Ethnicity 
requirement 
was 

new and it was one of their 
efforts toward creating a more 
equitable campus and teaching 
about race. But there’s also … a 
lot of reasons why things can’t 
happen or simple things can’t 
happen quickly or can’t happen 
at all.

But what I’ve learned in my 

time here is that administrators 
are not aware of issues that 
students, staff or faculty face 
unless we tell them about it 
and work on it together. So the 
Islamophobia Working Group 
was formed, and it’s been 
very active in trying to create 
spaces for ME/NA-identified 
students and Muslim students 
on campus, and we’re a group 
of over 100 faculty, staff and 
students who strategize on 
how to do this together.

So, we’ve been working on 

three areas. One of the areas 
is increasing the number of 
reflection spaces on campus 
to facilitate prayer for Muslim 
students who pray five times a 
day so they don’t have to walk 
all the way across campus to 
do that, and as a result of the 
Islamophobia Working Group’s 
efforts, there are many more 

reflection spaces on campus. It 
was actually a fairly easy thing 
to do.

We’ve also been advocating 

for a Middle Eastern/North 
African-identity checkbox and 
we’ve had many meetings with 
the administration and it is 
well underway of happening.

The third thing we’ve been 

working on over the last two 
and a half years is changing the 
Arabic language textbook or 
modifying it or supplementing 
it 
in 
some 
way, 
because 

students pointed out that it is 
orientalist and militaristic and 
Arabic language is not taught 
in the same way as other 
languages. … Students have 
been working on this, raising 
awareness about it, and their 
task force in Near-Eastern 
Studies to figure out how to 
resolve the issue.

The larger point is that we 

need to get more involved and 
inform the administration and 
work with them to make the 
kinds of changes that we want 
to happen on campus.

TMD: Can you talk about 

your new and exciting position 
coming up and what you’re 
most looking forward to?

My new position is in the 

Department 
of 
American 

Studies 
and 
Ethnicity 
at 

the University of Southern 
California, 
and 
that 

department 
is 
considered 

to very comparable to the 
Department 
of 
American 

Culture at U of M, so I feel 
very fortunate to be going to 
a similar kind of structure in 

the department. I’m hoping 
to collaborate with colleagues 
there to create a minor for 
Arab and Muslim American 
studies. They don’t have one, 
but there is a critical mass 
of faculty there that make it 
possible, so I am excited about 
that. I have to say that a lot 
of what I’m looking forward 
to is unknown right now. I’ve 
been here 18 years — 4 years as 
an undergrad, 14 as a faculty 
member, and so this next 
step really represents a new 
chapter, being challenged in 
new ways, a new adventure. 
So I’m looking forward to see 
where the future takes me. But, 
since I write about television 
and film, I’m curious about 
how or whether the proximity 
to Hollywood might shape my 
work in new ways.

TMD: 
What 
is 
a 
final 

sentiment 
you’d 
like 
to 

leave 
with 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan, 
and 
more 

specifically, the communities 
in which you’ve played such a 
prominent role?

My final sentiment is one of 

gratitude to all the people that 
I’ve had the opportunity to 
collaborate with on making U 
of M a more inclusive campus 
and 
also 
gratitude 
to 
my 

colleagues for supporting the 
vision in creating this Arab 
and Muslim American studies 
program that’s so unique and 
necessary given the social and 
political context that we’re 
living in today.

Since 2004, there have only 
been three instances in which 
a vote could occur due to the 
requirement that a minimum of 
100 faculty members be present.

University President Mark 

Schlissel discussed initiatives 
he hopes to implement next 
semester and in the future. 
Schlissel said he is working to 
promote access, affordability 
and equity for all students and 
applicants. 
He 
claimed 
the 

new Go Blue Guaranteeprogram, 
which provides in-state students 
with an annual family income of 
$65,000 or less with free tuition 
and fees, has increased in-state 
applications by 24 percent. 
However, there has only been a 
6 percent increase in those who 
actually attend.

Schlissel also discussed the 

Wolverine Pathways program, 
which aims to help students in 
grades 7 through 12 prepare 
for college. He said while these 
younger students still need to 
do the work to be accepted to 
the University, this is an effort 

to prepare them as much as 
possible when that time comes.

“A lot of these students come 

from schools where it is kind 
of harder to show how talented 
you are,” Schlissel said. “So 
we have to work on better 
ways to identify talented kids 
coming out of less advantaged 
communities.”

Schlissel discussed academic 

innovation and posed questions 
regarding the meaning of having 
a degree from the University 
and whether the University 
should focus on teaching skills 
that lead to employability. 

He also pushed for University 

professors and students from 
all schools to work together to 
get the University on a “path 
towards carbon neutrality.”

During the second half of 

the assembly meeting, Schlissel 
discussed sexual misconduct at 
the University for both student-
student 
relationships 
and 

faculty-student 
relationships. 

Schlissel 
claimed 
his 

administration has always been 
aware of sexual misconduct on 
campus, but now he is placing 
more emphasis on preventing it. 

“My executives and I — 

the deans, the provost — we 

really increased our attention 
and tried to figure out ways 
to be increasingly proactive,” 
Schlissel said. “This is an area 
we have always tried to stay on 
top of, but we’re really doubling 
down because of the level of 
importance and the level of 
scrutiny that the University and 
society has placed itself under.”

Schlissel said campus climate 

surveys have revealed a lot of 
gender-based 
mistreatment 

at the University. He said all 
staff and students should feel 
comfortable 
and 
valued 
on 

campus, and noted this could 
lower the number of sexual 
misconduct allegations.

To 
combat 
these 
sexual 

misconduct 
issues, 
Schlissel 

said the University is making 
an effort to change its sexual 
misconduct policies. One aspect 
of this effort is recruiting a 
former employee of the Obama 
adminstration with Title IX 
experience to lead a critique 
of the current Department of 
Education policy changes to 
Title IX.

19 hate crimes were reported 

by UMPD in 2017, while 11 
were reported in 2016 and 
two in 2015, according to data 
obtained 
directly 
from 
the 

University of Michigan Police 
Department. From 2015 to 2017, 
the Black community reported 
the 
highestnumber 
of 
hate 

crimes (14) followed by hate 
crimes 
against 
multiple 

racial groups (4), the LGBTQ 
community (4), the Muslim 
community 
(4), 
the 
Jewish 

community 
(3), 
the 
white 

community (2) and females (1).

LSA 
senior 
Timberlee 

Whiteus, 
vice 
president 
of 

the 
University’s 
National 

Association 
for 
the 

Advancement of Colored People 
chapter, said the data reported 
does not surprise her.

“These 
numbers 
don’t 

surprise 
me,” 
Whiteus 

wrote in an email interview. 
“These 
things 
happen, 
and 

administration does their best 
to ensure they happen covertly 
so that the university’s name is 
not tarnished.”

According 
to 
Whiteus, 

the 
University’s 
history 
of 

inadequate 
responses 
to 

hate crimes and other bias 
incidents 
may 
cause 

marginalized communities to 
feel hesitant about reporting 
hate crimes.

“People don’t feel supported,” 

Whiteus wrote. “Looking at the 
history of how the university 
responds to bias incidents, it 
can make it difficult to make 
a report when one sees that 
the university has historically 
not responded in a way that is 
progressive.”

Business senior Mohammad 

Shaikh, president of the Muslim 
Students’ 
Association, 
said 

the Muslim community feels 
comfortable 
reporting 
hate 

crimes to Division of Public 
Safety and Security. He noted 
it is something they have had to 
do relatively frequently in the 
past couple years upon finding 
condoms and urine in University 
reflection rooms, a space where 
many Muslim students pray.

Shaikh also noted DPSS has 

repeatedly 
encouraged 
the 

Muslim community to use them 
as a resource and have been 
sensitive 
and 
understanding 

when contacted.

Still, Shaikh said he will 

never 
forget 
the 
anti-Islam 

speech written on the Diag 
in 2016 or the University’s 
response to it. The incident was 
not recorded as a hate crime and 
the University did not remove 
the statement.

“Literally the first day, I won’t 

forget it, it was a Wednesday 

in the middle of April, kind of 
like the midst of finals,” Shaikh 
said. “Someone wrote ‘Stop 
Islam’ in huge black letters on 
the Diag. They used the bronze 
‘M’ on the Diag to be the ‘M’ in 
Islam. I think the frustrating 
thing was that the University’s 
response 
in 
these 
kind 
of 

situations, 
where 
it’s 
‘free 

speech,’ is called into question, 
because it’s something that’s 
hateful and potentially makes 
Muslim students feel unsafe 
on campus, that there’s people 
with these views. That was a 
big concern, the University isn’t 
washing this off, they’re not 
taking a strong stance. In those 
situations, the University was 
very, as expected, very cautious 
and not very prompt with their 
response. I think it took over a 
week for (University President) 
Mark Schlissel to say anything 
about it.”

Public Policy senior Daniel 

Greene, president of Central 
Student Government, said the 
invisible nature of LGBTQ+ 
identities presents a unique 
challenge 
to 
the 
LGBTQ+ 

community 
when 
reporting 

hate crimes.

“If it’s a severe hate crime, I 

think that what often happens 
with the LGBTQ community 
is that if somebody has to call 
security, call the police, go 
to the hospital in the more 
severe, unfortunate situations,” 
Greene said. “It’s not always 
tagged as an LGBTQ hate crime 
because being LGBTQ is often 
an invisible identity. If the 
question is either not asked by 
the people who are supporting 
the survivor of the hate crime, 
or if the survivor, he, she, 
or 
they, 
themselves 
don’t 

articulate it, then oftentimes it 
falls off radar.”

Greene said as a white male 

and a student leader, he would 
feel comfortable reporting a 
hate crime to DPSS or seeking 
other 
University 
resources, 

something that more private 
members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ+ 

community may not do.

“I’m fully aware I carry a 

lot of privilege as an LGBTQ 
member — I’m a gay male who 
identifies as white, and I’m also 
a student leader, so I’m more 
willing to seek those resources 
here on campus,” Greene said. 
“I do believe there is a barrier 
that exists for closeted or non-
out members of the LGBTQ 
community in articulating the 
hate crimes. I can’t speculate 
to whether or not they’d report 
that harm was done, but I can 
tell you there’s an increased 
likelihood that they won’t link 
it to a sexual orientation or 
a gender identity, if they do 
choose to seek some remedy.”

LSA junior Emma Wergeles, 

external relations officer of the 
University’s Hillel, expressed 

concern and surprise about 
the increasing number of hate 
crimes on campus. She said the 
data collected in aggregate is 
demoralizing.

“It’s 
really 
surprising,” 

Wergeles 
said. 
“It’s 

disheartening. Looking at the 
data from the three years, the 
increase in volume regardless 
of 
which 
community 
was 

attacked is really concerning, 
and really hurtful and kind of 
heartbreaking for the entire 
campus community. The fact 
that there’s that many hate 
crimes at all is really, really 
scary.”

Wergeles 
said 
with 

recent 
events 
targeting 
the 

Jewish 
community, 
such 

as the murder of nine Jews 
worshipping inside a Pittsburgh 
synagogue, 
her 
community 

within 
Hillel 
has 
been 

extremely supportive in dealing 
with hate crimes against the 
Jewish community as a whole.

“I 
personally 
haven’t 

experienced a hate crime, so 
I can’t speak to that, but I do 
feel a really strong community 
and 
support 
system 
within 

Hillel and within the Jewish 
community,” 
Wergeles 
said. 

“I think that my experiences 
within the Jewish community 
has led me to believe that 
we’re really supported by this 
University and we’re really 
supported by the administration 
and 
we’re 
really 
supported 

by the leaders of the Jewish 
community, whether it be at 
Hillel or elsewhere.”

While 
different 

marginalized 
communities 

may express varying levels of 
comfort with reporting hate 
crimes, Whiteus believes many 
people may still be confused 
about how to even report them.

“I 
believe 
people 
are 

sometimes 
confused 
as 
to 

how they can report a hate 
crime to DPSS,” Whiteus said. 
“Once someone experiences a 
hate crime, I don’t think the 
first response is to report it, 
but to ask, ‘Why me?’ Issues 
such as these can cause one 
to 
be 
distraught, 
and 
yes 

uncomfortable when reporting 
the crime because it causes 
them to relive that moment.”

According to Whiteus, the 

solution lies in increased racial 
diversity of University police 
officers.

“To 
increase 
comfort, 
I 

believe DPSS has to increase 
representation,” 
Whiteus 

said. “A student might feel 
more 
comfortable 
reporting 

a crime to someone who can 
understand, and possibly relate 
to them.”

A

ctivism, no matter the issue 
at stake, entails sacrificing 
resources and effort in 
pursuit of some larger cause. This 
stands in stark contrast to ignorance, 
and an outlook that is of self-centered 
attainment.
By 1968, resistance of the New 
Left had reached its peak, and 
change on a massive scale seemed 
probable. Protests on a seemingly 
unprecedented scale had swept the 
traditional world powers — America 
and Europe. Traditional norms of 
political participation seemed to be 
shifting as well, with students and 
oppressed peoples alike asserting 
themselves like never before. This was 
the work of a new kind of culture: that 
of the New Left. And no American 
institution better embodied the ideas 
and practice of the New Left more 
so than the University of Michigan’s 
very own Students for a Democratic 
Society, or SDS.
I would venture to guess that few 
people on this campus have learned 
about the history of SDS. I would also 
guess that even fewer people know 
of SDS’s founder, former University 
of Michigan student Alan Haber. 
However, the political turbulence of 
a half-century ago and the New Left 
that defined it would be incomplete 
without Haber, whose activist work 
at the national level is typified by his 
founding and leadership of SDS, and 
his presence is still felt in Ann Arbor.
Now in his 80s, Haber has a lifetime 
of 
activism, 
political 
radicalism 
and community involvement on 
which to draw and reflect. But his 
story begins at this very university. 
During an interview with The Daily, 
Haber recounted how, like many 
of us, he entered college confident 
in, or at least accepting of, the 
political values instilled in him by 
his parents. Then, introduced to the 
idea of picketing during a campus 
protest, he commenced his, as he 
puts it, “deviation to the left” by 
helping organize an open discussion 
on a campus whose student body 
was politically dominated by very 
conservative Young Republicans and 
very conservative Young Democrats. 
His knack for presentation was 
undeniable. He claimed to have once 
set up a table in the Fishbowl for those 
interested in the antiwar movement 
right next to the table of a U.S. Army 
recruiter.
Listening to Haber speak, one gets 
the sense that by “conservative” he 
refers less to a set of specific principles 
about economic and social policy as he 
does to a rigid system of prescriptions 
for who should and should not be 
participating in the political process. 
At the turn of the 1960s, Haber’s 
disdain for conservative ideas of 
political participation was realized 
with the formation of SDS on the 
University’s campus. Increasingly, 
SDS became part of the national 
conversation that was repudiating 
much of the staunch conformity of 
the 1950s, and in doing so helped 
bring the idea of counterculture to the 
forefront of that era. 
Needless 
to 
say, 
the 
anti-
intellectuals of the day were not 
pleased 
when 
SDS 
and 
other 
elements of the New Left began to 
rip into America’s status quo. For 
racial segregation and unquestioning 
deference to President Lyndon B. 
Johnson’s foreign policy were, to 
the anti-intellectuals of the time, 
assurances 
that 
things 
would 
continue on as they always had. By the 
1960s, America was unquestionably 
prosperous, as both class mobility 
and wealth from that era reflect. Why 
should anyone impede that spirit of 
continuous material attainment by, 
say, distracting students from their 
work to have them discuss and protest 
the Vietnam War? 
This was the prevailing attitude 
in 1965, when such actions were 
taken by University professors in the 
nation’s first Vietnam War “teach-
in.” Supporters of the Johnson 
administration’s 
newly-escalated 
war in southeast Asia derided the 
professors leading the teach-in as 
neglecting their professional duties, 
while Michigan Gov. George Romney 
sternly issued a similar rebuke to the 
professors involved, claiming “(they 
were) inviting anarchy in saying 
that (they), or any other person or 
group, have the right to decide when 
an issue is important enough to 
halt the regular activity of a public 
institution.” 
Romney was right to defend the 
right of public institutions, including 
education, to be enjoyed by the public 
without significant hindrance. But 
with an attitude toward any dissent 
as hostile as the one unfolding on the 
University’s campus, how could the 
public ever debate the topic freely? 
And without the ability to openly 
debate the war its tax dollars were 
funding, how could the public ever 
claim the power to change its mind, 

to hold the government accountable? 
To change one’s mind, of course, 
is to gain understanding through 
instruction and thought — hallmarks 
of culture, and therefore unwelcome 
concepts to anti-intellectual thought.
In this way, the resistance of 
the 1960s embodied by SDS is best 
characterized as a reorientation of 
political expectations. The America 
out of which SDS had emerged 
could be classified as majority anti-
intellectual, disinclined to join or 
support any active role in dismantling 
traditional inequalities because these 
inequalities served as bulwarks 
against monumental upheavals of 
society. As evidenced by widespread 
views of the late Martin Luther King 
Jr. bringing his assassination upon 
himself and the Chicago police being 
justified in their televised beating 
of protesters, this sentiment had 
survived well into 1968. 
It was not just the public that was 
widely intolerant of dissent, either. 
Those entrusted to protect the liberal 
ideals of rights and civil liberties 
also seemed inclined to mislabel 
the rabble-rousers as unpatriotic, as 
demonstrated by lethal directives 
given to U.S. soldiers leading up to the 
1967 Pentagon protest. These attitudes 
more commonly associated with 
authoritarian regimes found fertile 
breeding ground in a anti-intellectual 
American public willing to trade 
truth for comfort. Subsequently, the 
very notion that the war itself was 
unjust was often eclipsed by the belief 
that those opposing it were the real 
problem. The fabricated myth of “the 
spitting protester,” and the extent to 
which American society accepts this 
myth as fact, is proof enough.
Of course, this is not to say that 
only those Americans occupying 
research fellowships in Ivy League 
philosophy departments or studying 
art history value culture. There are 
many who lead much more grounded 
lives yet still value ideas and embrace 
change that stands to better future 
societies — there is a reason America 
values self-expression more so than 
most places in the world. Nor is it 
fair to label all right-leaning citizens 
as anti-intellectual, for there are 
conservative Americans too whose 
opposition to progressive policies 
stems from ethical principles and 
not necessarily a desire to see all 
attempts at reform made subservient 
to material priorities. 
The 
true 
anti-intellectuals, 
however, were those Americans 
unwilling to see that what King 
exposed was not his own ability 
to instigate, but a deep systemic 
hatred that had long been enabled 
by onlookers who chose to accept 
it. They were those Americans 
unwilling to see that what the 
antiwar protesters had experienced 
in Chicago was not law and order, but 
overzealous use of force that was also 
enabled by onlookers who chose to 
accept it. These Americans, beyond 
those who were truly enthusiastic 
about 
racist 
and 
authoritarian 
policies, believed any sort of support 
for change to be too costly to anti-
intellectual ambitions.
They believed this, in part, because 
they saw their own participation 
in change as minor. You voted for 
the candidate you wanted, and you 
shut your mouth for the next two or 
four years thereafter if you didn’t get 
things your way. What made the work 
of SDS important was not necessarily 
that it fit neatly into what we might 
now label as “politically progressive,” 
but that it sought to challenge these 
traditional limitations on what should 
be questioned and who should be 
doing the questioning. As Americans 
have increasingly recognized since 
the time of SDS, this idea of constant 
political participation is a powerful 
tool in shaping governments to 
be more representative of their 
constituents. And though Haber 
has written off demonstration and 
confrontation as largely expired 
methods of participation, the gun 
control activists of Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School that Haber 
frequently praises illustrate how 
direct political involvement need not 
follow the often uncivil model of SDS 
to earn validation.
The incivility of SDS also illustrates 
how, even in activism, moderation is a 
virtue. By no means does moderation 
endanger activists, and others who 
value culture, from drifting toward 
anti-intellectualism. On the contrary, 
it enhances the chance of success 
by binding its adherents to logical 
principles. The tragic and violent 
path taken by some of Haber’s former 
associates in SDS’s late years as part 
of the Weather Underground serves 
as a fine example. Another instance 
is that of distinguished University 
Professor Victor Lieberman, who 
was a dedicated member of the 
antiwar movement while a college 
student in the 1960s and 1970s but 

has moderated his views considerably 
since then. 
Lieberman is not afraid to speak 
about his past radicalism — in an 
interview with The Daily he recalled 
how he held a celebration with his 
wife when Saigon was taken by 
Communist forces in 1975. Even 
deeper than the shared antiwar 
participation of Haber and Lieberman 
during these times, however, is 
the primacy with which both men 
characterized their antiwar efforts. 
Lieberman’s support of antiwar 
Democratic politicians at the time 
can be seen as a reflection of Haber’s 
broad efforts against what he terms 
“the whole system of war,” in which 
opposition to U.S. involvement in 
Vietnam opposed not only the war but 
also cycles of “domination, coercion, 
violence” in other issue areas, such as 
civil rights and gender equality. The 
desired transition from a “system of 
war” to one of peace thus manifested 
itself as support for national liberation 
movements across the board. 
The result, as Lieberman put it, 
was a “highly romanticized, idealistic 
image that many anti-war activists, 
(himself) included, had of the 
Vietnamese Communist movement 
— as well as the allied Khmer 
and Lao Communist parties and 
‘fraternal’ revolutionary movements 
in China, Cuba, Nicaragua, Angola, 
Mozambique and the Palestinian 
territories.” Today, none of these 
countries or territories are considered 
healthy democracies, and many have 
successfully resisted any guarantee 
of civil liberties or basic rights to 
their citizens. Admiration for these 
movements, then, should yield to 
nuanced and unemotional analysis 
if activists are to avoid supporting 
regimes that do without the essential 
liberal institutions we enjoy in 
America.
This does not mean, of course, 
that there is nothing to learn from 
the times of Haber and Lieberman. 
The struggles that activists fight for 
in 2018 may not be the same as those 
that existed in 1968, but the parallels 
are undeniable. There is no great 
overseas struggle uniting antiwar 
activists at home now as there was 50 
years ago, and therefore no universal 
American trust in foreign policy to 
break once more. There are, however, 
unprecedented signs of the U.S. 
president being held accountable for 
foreign policy in an era of rampant 
unaccountability. Images of civil 
rights activists confronted with 
cordons of soldiers do not circulate 
now, but increased attention paid to 
law enforcement abuses has resulted 
in increased scrutiny of police. At the 
other end of these issues, as always, 
are those who care only to resist any 
reform and all the good that may 
entail because staying put is the 
easiest thing to do.
It is clear that the issues and 
dynamics of Haber and Lieberman’s 
college 
days 
have 
not 
simply 
disappeared, and they are well aware 
of it. Their antiwar struggle failed in 
1968, as the Democrats nominated 
a pro-war candidate and lost to an 
ostensibly anti-war Republican who 
would continue the war for several 
more years. The lessons they have 
taken away differ greatly: Lieberman 
reflects on the antiwar movement 
as generating resentment among 
the majority of Americans, while 
Haber’s more hopeful takeaway 
reflects on how much more savvy 
activists are now than they were 
in his day. Lieberman now advises 
politically-inclined 
students 
to 
approach the types of movements 
he so enthusiastically cheered on 
with “neither fawning adulation nor 
unmitigated contempt, but clear-eyed 
intellectual analysis.” Haber speaks to 
how siloed and issue-focused activist 
groups have become nowadays, 
which presents a challenge for 
forming a cohesive multi-issue front 
such as SDS. 
The two men’s markedly different 
takeaways, however, do not take away 
from their respective prescriptions 
for those looking to contribute to our 
culture. Reflecting on their musings, 
current students should realize that 
when important issues arise — issues 
that are important not because they 
stand to bring riches or pleasure but 
because they affect lives — we should 
all resist the kneejerk calls of the anti-
intellectuals to dismiss calls to action. 
Living day-to-day or choosing a career 
based on financial considerations is 
no crime, but ignoring the culture 
we have built and attempts to build 
it further does a disservice to us all. If 
we can take one thing away from the 
tumult and violence and upheaval and 
loss and gain of 50 years ago, it is that 
no matter how we do so, we should 
strive to contribute to this culture any 
way we can.

T

he issue of gun violence in 
America is insurmountable. 
Following 
the 
mass 
shooting that killed 17 
at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School 
in Parkland, Fla., in 
February of this year, 
acts of violence and 
their public protests 
have dominated the 
news cycle. To many, 
it may seem like mass 
shootings in America 
are 
increasing 
with 
alarming 
frequency. 
This notion is largely accurate. Of 
the 30 deadliest mass shootings in 
United States history since 1949, 18 
of them have occurred in the last 10 
years. Beyond the mass shootings 
that garner the public’s attention, gun 
violence in its more underreported 
forms casts a long shadow over the 
lives of millions of Americans. In fact, 
every day 96 Americans are killed by 
guns, and hundreds more are injured.
Few topics in American politics 
are as hotly debated as gun violence. 
While most people acknowledge it is 
a serious problem plaguing society, 
there are differing opinions on how 
to best combat the issue. The solution 
to gun violence is likely as complex 
as the issue itself, and there is no 
clear-cut method of putting an end 
to the carnage. Nevertheless, one 
facet contributing to the devastation 
of the gun violence epidemic is 
simultaneously glaringly apparent 
yet often overlooked: its strong 
connection to gender-based violence.
In the confusing and painful 
aftermaths of our nation’s numerous 
mass shootings, the most sought-after 
information is often the perpetrator’s 
identity. Many of these shooters 
appear to have little in common, 
and their motives typically remain 
unknown. However, the common 
thread of domestic violence often 
strings this group together. In 54 
percent of mass shootings, defined 
as an incident in which four or more 
people are killed, the perpetrator 
killed a partner or family member.
Violence against women is a strong 
predictor of mass gun violence. 
Before he opened fire in Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School, 
Nikolas Cruz was accused of abuse 
by an ex-girlfriend and of stalking 
by a female classmate. Devin Patrick 
Kelley, who killed 26 in a church 
service 
in 
Sutherland 
Springs, 
Texas, would not have been able to 

purchase a firearm if his domestic 
violence court-martial had been 
properly reported. Pulse nightclub 
shooter Omar Mateen 
allegedly beat his ex-wife 
and held her hostage 
before they eventually 
divorced. Though not an 
intimate partner, Adam 
Lanza was motivated by 
anger toward his mother, 
whom he also killed, in 
his massacre of 20 first-
graders and six educators 
at Sandy Hook Elementary 
School. 
Virginia 
Tech 
shooter Seung Hui Choi, Las Vegas 
shooter 
Stephen 
Paddock 
and 
congressional baseball shooter James 
T. Hodgkinson all had a history of 
violence or hatred toward women 
before their respective rampages. 
Recently, Juan Lopez shot and killed 

his ex-fiancé Tamara O’Neal and 
two others before turning the gun 
on himself at Mercy Hospital and 
Medical Center in Chicago.
A history of domestic violence is a 
troubling yet clear trend among the 
nation’s high-profile mass shooters. 
The connection between violence 
against women and gun violence 
extends far past the shootings that 
capture the attention of the news 
cycle, though. In the United States, 
women are 16 times more likely to be 
shot and killed than women in other 
developed nations. If a gun is available 
to the perpetrator within a domestic 
violence situation, the victim is five 
times more likely to be killed. In the 
average month in the United States, 
about 50 women are shot and killed 
due to domestic violence, while many 
more are injured. Around 1 million 
American women alive today have 
been shot or shot at by an intimate 
partner, while 4.5 million have been 
threatened with gun violence.
Current gun laws are supposed 
to prevent those with a history of 

domestic violence from purchasing 
firearms. One in seven unlawful gun 
buyers deterred from purchasing by 
a federal background check is denied 
because of past domestic abuse. 
Since it began in 1998, the federal 
criminal background check system 
has 
blocked 
300,000 
domestic 
abusers from buying guns. However, 
in far too many cases victims are left 
woefully unprotected from their 
abusers by federal laws. For example, 
federal 
background 
checks 
are 
only mandated for sales at licensed 
dealers. This means that abusers can 
still purchase guns by attending gun 
shows or from unlicensed sellers they 
find on the internet. Furthermore, 
most gun laws only prevent those 
with past convictions of abuse from 
purchasing guns. Many domestic 
abusers who already own guns are 
not required to dispose of them. Only 
15 states currently require abusers 
with restraining orders to turn in 
their guns. 
Gun violence in the United States 
is incredibly destructive. With each 
new mass shooting, Americans 
are reminded of the peril that 
millions in the nation live with daily. 
Beyond those impacted directly, 
the ripple effects of gun violence 
impact everybody. The profound 
psychological effects of living in fear 
of being shot combined with the 
immense financial costs of repeated 
shootings from medical care and 
the criminal justice system have 
made it impossible to ignore the gun 
violence epidemic. The manner by 
which the epidemic impacts women 
is especially harsh. The relationship 
between 
gender-based 
violence 
and gun violence is apparent, and 
it is costing many lives. Keeping 
guns out of the hands of domestic 
abusers would prevent countless 
instances of gun violence. States that 
prevent individuals with domestic 
violence restraining orders from 
purchasing guns and also require 
them to relinquish their firearms see 
a 10-percent lower rate of intimate 
partner homicide overall as well as 
a 14-percent lower rate of intimate 
partner gun homicide. Keeping 
women safe from gun violence is in 
the best interest of society as a whole, 
preventing 
dangerous 
weapons 
from falling into the possession of 
dangerous individuals.

At the very least, “Bad Blood” 
lives up to its name: It’s bad 
and there’s blood. Other than 
that, there isn’t much nice to 
say about the stale six-episode 
mafia docudrama making its 
international debut on Netflix 
after a premiere on Canada’s 
Citytv last year.

It’s limply acted, turgidly 
written and plotted in such a 
way that the season feels much, 
much longer than it is. In some 
stretches, “Bad Blood” is so 
painfully boring, you’ll wish you 
were sleeping with the fishes. It 
doesn’t help that we’ve seen this 
type of story told a million times 
before, to much better success.
“Bad Blood” does begin with 
an interesting hook: It’s telling 
a true story, one of Montreal’s 
notorious Rizzuto crime family, 
which oversaw a vast criminal 
empire from the port city for 
decades. 
A 
flashy 
opening 
sequence introduces us to Vito 
Rizzuto 
(Anthony 
LaPaglia, 
“Without a Trace”), who takes 
over for his father as mob boss 
and 
successfully 
unites 
the 
city’s warring syndicates. We’re 
also treated to a little cameo 
from Cheryl Blossom’s maple-

syrup-mogul-turned-Canadian-
heroin-smuggler dad. (Joke.)
Vito’s 
son, 
Nicolo 
Jr. 
(Brett Donahue, “The Other 
Kingdom”) is clean-cut and 
independently successful with 
no interest in the mob business. 
So naturally, when Vito is sent 
to prison, Nicolo is — gasp! — 
roped into the mob business. 
The exception to otherwise 
uninspiring 
performances 
is 
the excellent Kim Coates (“Sons 
of Anarchy”) as Declan, Vito’s 
capable if ruthless right-hand 
man, who keeps the Rizzuto 
operation running when Nicolo 
Jr. proves inept.
Oh, and there are also some 
women characters. In a big win 
for diversity, the female roles 
on “Bad Blood” range from 
stripper to mistress to backup 
mistress to shrill politician. It’s 
not quite clear whether these 
lovely, leggy ladies have inner 
lives or distinguishing traits. But 
who needs those when a made 
man makes you his woman? At 
one point, Vito’s two paramours 
fistfight in a department store, 
a failure of the Bechdel test so 
spectacular it makes “The Wolf 
of Wall Street” look like it was 
directed by Betty Friedan.
Sure, this genre has never 
been 
especially 
friendly 
to 
women. But even the stingiest 
analysis of Carmela Soprano 
or Kay Adams would find them 
lightyears 
more 
progressive 
than the women of “Bad Blood” 
— if for no other reason than that 
they have names.
Is it really fair to compare 

“Bad Blood” to “The Sopranos” 
and 
“The 
Godfather,” 
two 
universally-adored, 
zeitgeisty pieces of gangster 
entertainment? 
Maybe 
not, 
but that’s the tricky fate of 
any 
on-screen 
depiction 
of 
mobster life. “Bad Blood” very 
badly wants to say something 
interesting about family and 
difficult decisions. But in the 
process, it forgets that prestige 
TV, in addition to the nudity and 
violence, also needs to be good. 
The closer resemblance here is 
to “House of Cards,” another 
show cloaked in enough neo-noir 
and masculine energy to dupe an 
audience into believing that its 
hokey truisms about power are 
actually profound.
The 
explicit 
cultural 
connections 
“Bad 
Blood” 
is inviting aren’t doing the 
show many favors either. That 
writer-producers Simon Barry 
(“Continuum”) 
and 
Michael 
Konyves (“Barney’s Version”) 
have 
described 
this 
as 
a 
“Shakespearean-level 
revenge 
tale” betrays an almost laughable 
inexperience with the Bard’s 
work. If only there were some 
hugely renowned Shakespeare 
festival in Canada where they 
could discover just how far off 
that comparison is.
Canada, 
you 
may 
have 
universal health care, the better 
side of Niagara Falls and Kawhi 
Leonard. But when it comes to 
the gangster genre, we’ve got you 
squarely beat. It’s not personal, 
it’s strictly business. So let’s just 
call it even, eh?

TV REVIEW

I didn’t think I would ever be 
able to write a Books that Built 
Us column. I read a lot, but my 
memory of anything beyond my 
freshman year of high school is 
spotty at best. I have plenty of 
favorite books from my childhood, 
most of which proved formative 
enough to warrant me writing a 
column like this. But, alas, I’d have 
to reread each of those books, 
cover to cover, to understand 
what about them made them 
great. And even then, I’d never 
fully remember the ways in which 
those books impacted me; I’d only 
remember that the impact they 
carried was profound.
But then I read “Becoming,” 
the recently released memoir 
by 
Michelle 
Obama, 
and 
I 
realized that I’m not finished 
building myself. According to 
Michelle, even her identity has 
yet to completely round out. 
Call it corny, call it meta, but 
“Becoming” is a book about 
building ourselves; it built me 
by proving that this journey 
never stops. Like Michelle, I’ll 
spend my entire life constructing 
the woman I want to become, 
creating change on a scale that’s 
even a morsel of what my Forever 
FLOTUS has managed to enact. 
The opportunity for lifelong 
growth is a beautiful thing, and 

I was too caught up in my insular 
college bubble to notice that until 
now.
“Becoming” is divided into 
three sections. In “Becoming 
Me,” Michelle takes us from her 

early childhood on Chicago’s 
South Side through her tenure 
at high-power Chicago law firm 
Sidley Austin. In “Becoming 

Us” she explains how a former 
mentee, named Barack, became 
her partner in life and, eventually, 
the 44th President of the United 
States. Finally, in “Becoming 
More,” Michelle details how she, 
her husband and their daughters 
Malia 
and 
Sasha 
navigated 
eight years in the White House, 
holding themselves to standards 
infinitely more stringent than 
those of former First Families, 
whose everyday actions weren’t 
seen as representing an entire 
racial group. The life of Michelle, 
a working-class Robinson turned 
world-leader 
Obama, 
clearly 
hasn’t been an easy one, but she 
makes it known that it’s been 
fulfilling in ways she never 
imagined.
The book is peppered with 
gloriously 
honest 
anecdotes 
that 
transform 
Mrs. 
Obama 
from an almost otherworldly 
superwoman into a real-world 
role model, one who struggles to 
balance the needs of a country 
with the needs of her family and 
who embarrasses her kids on a 
regular basis. She recalls Malia’s 
prom night (then 16 years old, 
she asked her mom to “Just be 
cool please”) with the same level 
of detail as her feelings toward 
Donald Trump (spoiler: She’s not 
fond of him). Michelle’s choice to 
take equal care when discussing 
candid 
family 
moments 
and 
global politics speaks volumes. 
This, I thought while reading, is a

Obama is transformative

BOOKS THAT BUILT US 

woman who has her priorities in 
line.
I now see a little piece of 
Michelle Obama within myself, 
and lately, that has been enough 
to lift me out of my most insecure 
moments. I watch my talented 
friends secure internships at 
Fortune 
500 
companies 
as 
my email inbox runs dry, and 
instead of moping, I remind 
myself 
that 
Michelle 
was 
waitlisted at Harvard Law, a fact 
I hadn’t known before reading 
“Becoming.” 
When 
I 
catch 
myself getting frustrated with 
an unexpected shift in routine, 

I remember her resilience as 
her husband’s political career 
uprooted the life she’d built in 
Chicago, catapulting herself and 
her daughters across the country 
into a world of opulence and 
cynicism unlike anything they’d 
ever seen.
We’re 
all 
building 
and 
building ourselves. As Michelle 
conveys through “Becoming”’s 
melancholy epilogue, that process 
is full of ups and downs. At some 
point, each of us will see our 
hard work upended by our own 
personal Trump administration. 
It’s inevitable, but it’s up to us to 

decide how we respond. We can 
lose hope and retreat, or we can 
be like Michelle. “In my most 
worried moments, I take a breath 
and remind myself of the dignity 
and decency I’ve seen in people 
throughout my life, the many 
obstacles that have already been 
overcome,” she writes, adding: 
“I hope others will do the same.” 
Consider this column my answer 
to that call. I will continue to 
struggle against my personal 
evils, but I will continue to build 
myself. No matter what comes my 
way, I’ll be like Michelle and I’ll 
never stop becoming.

Each year, I wait until the week 
prior to Thanksgiving to begin 
listening to Christmas music. I 
know that I won’t feel guilty for 
listening too early, and the delay 
of gratification is not deleterious 
to my experience of the holiday 
season. This year, a month before 

my season-opening date, Eric 
Clapton released his first-ever 
Christmas album, Happy Xmas, 
on Oct. 12.
We last heard from Clapton 
with his 2016 return to the 
country-blues arena with I Still 
Do, which received poor ratings 
from a number of publications 
as it failed to serve as a return to 
the 73-year-old guitarist’s “glory 
days.”
Clapton’s 
release 
of 
a 
Christmas album was a bit 
unexpected. 
Clapton 
has 
been relatively silent since a 
disappointing 2016, so the fact 
that his next attempt at a “return” 
would be through a Christmas 
album is, for his critics and 
listeners, out of left field.
Nonetheless, Clapton is a 
connoisseur of the blues, and 
I was interested to see what 
his take on a Christmas album 
would be. In short, Clapton 
combines 
Christmas 
classics 
with lesser-known Christmas-
themed titles to compile a set of 
covers that (mechanically) work. 
Essentially, Happy Xmas is not 
going to drive Clapton back to 
the center of popular music, but 
it contains the pillars of Clapton’s 
craft — masterful blues guitar, 
soothing vocals and an absence 

of much editing — that make for 
a functional Eric Clapton album.
Each 
track 
from 
Happy 
Xmas is a cover, similar to the 
construction 
of 
the 
classic 
Christmas albums from Bing 
Crosby, 
Frank 
Sinatra, 
Ella 
Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and 
so 
forth. 
However, 
Clapton 
intentionally 
included 
some 
lesser-known Christmas songs, 
such as “For Love on a Christmas 
Day,” and covers of Christmas 
pieces from Slade. As such, 
Clapton’s 
Christmas 
album 
covers a spectrum of sorts — he 
covers the classics while dusting 
off Christmas pieces from the 
bottom shelf.
Clapton covers this spectrum 
while 
maintaining 
a 
blues/
country 
atmosphere 
to 
his 
renditions — except for one house 
rendition of “Jingle Bells” that 
would throw the uneducated 
listener off. “Jingle Bells” is 
situated between “Home for the 
Holidays” and “Christmas in My 
Hometown,” both of which are 
the more bluesy tracks on the 
album. “Jingle Bells,” however, 
is a house/EDM track — unheard 
of from an artist like Clapton. 
According to Clapton, the track 
serves to pay tribute to the late 
Avicii, with whom Clapton had 
worked on spotted occasions. 
Clapton’s 
outrageous 
venture 
from his typical low-key style 
will no doubt come as a surprise 
to most. In fact, when I first 
listened to the album, not only 
was I thrown off by the venture 
into EDM, but I was disappointed 
to be hearing EDM while I 
was trying to listen to a blues 
Christmas album. That said, 
upon my research of the album, I 
was glad to discover that “Jingle 
Bells” is not Clapton’s attempt to 
get into the house/EDM game 
and rather a tribute to one of the 
genre’s greats.
Clapton’s Christmas album 
feels like a reflection on what 
is important to him, musically 
and personally. In an interview 

released on Clapton’s YouTube 
channel upon the album’s release, 
he said that the album “has 
taken a lifetime of Christmas 
experience and (listening to) 
Christmas music.” It is not 
difficult to feel that “lifetime of 
Christmas experience” baked 
into the Happy Xmas album.

The mistake that Clapton’s 
critics make, in 2016 with I 
Still Do and likely in 2018 with 
Happy Xmas, is the erroneous 
assumption 
that 
Clapton 
is 
trying to get back to his “glory 
days” or back into the popular 
music arena.
With no slight to the legendary 
musician, both I Still Do and 
Happy Xmas are examples of 
Clapton’s new career outlook: 
Clapton is making music for 
himself and his team, and 
whether his listeners enjoy the 
music is not his top concern.
The album’s cover art was 
done 
by 
Clapton 
himself, 
mimicking Bob Dylan’s artistry 
for Music from Big Pink. Clapton’s 
rough illustration of Santa Claus 
on a white background sets the 
tone for the album. The rough-
around-the-edges 
(literally) 
album art further symbolizes the 
notion that Clapton’s new music 
is homemade, made for himself, 
made for the joy that is making 
music, occasionally made for his 
long-standing fans.

62 “An egg’s way 
of making 
another egg”: 
Samuel Butler

The trees are shaking off 
their browned leaves, there 
is a distinct chill in the air, 
everything is peppermint and 
gingerbread and all about Santa 
Claus. It feels as though our 
hands are always cold. The 
pinkness in my cheeks, chapped 
lips and transition to warm cups 
of coffee has me nostalgic. I’m 
not sure if it feels the same for 
you, but for me, when the air finds 
a chill, something in me starts to 
crack open and head toward the 
sentimental. Maybe it’s the end 
of the year — looking back on 
12 calendar pages tossed in the 
trash with wistful remembrance. 
Or maybe the month of Dec. 
ignites an evocative, half shell of 
emotion in all of us.
Much of this sentimentality 
finds its roots in tradition. The 
stories of our life, the trifles of 
our upbringing and the pieces 
of history we pack in our bags 
even when we move far away are 
grounded in tradition. For my 
family, tradition starts with food. 
I’m sure it’s simply in our Italian 
blood, and the knack for cooking 
and inherent love for flavor 
were all curated somewhere in 
Southern Italy ages ago. But ever 
since I can remember, traditions 
were always centered around 
food. Every holiday and event, 
every means for celebrating 
— even if it was just a Sunday 
afternoon where we all had the 
privilege of being together — beat 
along with the idea that food and 
wine and good company could be 
the antidote to the world. If you 
paged through the scripture of 
my family history, you would be 
advised to always invite anyone 
inside who had nowhere to go 
and always celebrate with good 
food and good wine. You would 
be reminded that salt, reggiano 
parmigiano, heat and red wine 
are your friends when you are 
bent over a stove. You would 
learn about the selfless act of 
cooking for others. Somewhere 
in there, you would learn about 
me.
At this time of year, these 
thoughts take me to the holidays, 
namely, Christmas Eve, which in 
and of itself is a larger tradition 
for my family than Christmas 
day is. I wonder often where 
traditions begin. We seem to 
accept them as fact, much like 
mathematical equations. All of 
us have some piece of tradition, 
be it shattered or whole, be it 
long gone or still with us. Certain 
things we just know. At our home 
on Christmas Eve, anyone who 
doesn’t have somewhere to go is 
invited. Once you’ve been invited 
you never get removed from the 
invite list, even if we haven’t 
spoken in a year, even if you’ve 
moved away and moved on. You 
can simply never be uninvited. 
That’s just tradition.
So even if it’s the only time all 
year I see them, I can expect the 
same motley, loveable crew every 
year — same time, same place. 
There’s dancing and drinking 
and gift giving and perhaps most 
importantly, food. So much food 
that I often wonder if we’ll ever 
learn our lesson and prepare less 
than the outrageous amount we 
do. But the more the merrier 
seems to be the motto of the 
whole night every year — in 
regards to food, chilled glasses 
of wine and good company. If I 
could bottle up a feeling, it would 
be the one inside the white house 
on River Road every Christmas 
Eve. It is the epitome of what 
warmth feels like.
I wonder where this all began, 
where a tradition so specific and 
idiosyncratic in its nature found 
its beginning. My father, the 
spearhead of the bubbly, lively 
Dec. 24 affair is half-Jewish, 
half-Catholic and perhaps the 
most fond of Christmas anyone 
has ever been. This Christmas 
spirit 
began 
when 
he 
was 
raised by a Jewish mother and 
a Catholic father who didn’t 
believe in going to church. My 
dad tells me my grandfather 
found God in his kitchen every 
day. On Christmas Eve, our home 
is a non-denominational affair — 

with people identifying as every 
religion 
coming 
together 
to 
celebrate. If you don’t celebrate 
Christmas, if you believe Jesus 
roamed the earth and pray to him 
every morning, or you’re waiting 
for him still, or you don’t believe 
in him at all — you are welcome. 
It’s a peculiar and spectacular 
sight to see — an amalgamation 
of languages and cultures and 
ideas and love and music all 
pouring from the cracks in our 
walls. Merry Christmas, indeed.
When I traced my father’s 
history, which required light 
prodding and sweet memories, 
I found it all started with the 
Feast of the Seven Fishes, or 
Festa dei Sett Pesci, which is the 
Italian-American 
celebration 
of Christmas Eve which is a 
meal supplemented with dishes 
of seafood. The meal typically 
consists 
of 
seven 
different 
seafood 
dishes, 
originating 
in Southern Italy, where it is 
known simply as The Vigil or 
(La Vigilia). The tradition of 
eating seafood on Christmas Eve 
began from the Roman Catholic 
tradition of abstaining from 
eating meat on the eve of a feast 
day. Observant Catholics would 
instead turn to fish, and today, 
the meal has become a feast of 
seven, eight or even nine specific 
fishes that are considered to be 
traditional. Most Italian Fish 
Feasts commence with white 
fish in lemon and garlic, followed 
by clams and mussels mingling 
with ropes of spaghetti spattered 
in spicy tomato sauce, and a 
number of other fish dishes that 
may feel without end. I should 
tell you that I’ve never celebrated 
Christmas Eve with a traditional 
Festa dei Sette Pesci, but it is 
important in bringing you down 
the line of my life, nonetheless.
Before I was born, when my 
father and his brother were 
boys, they celebrated with a 
traditional Feast of the Seven 
Fishes, cooked by their father at 
the home in which they grew up. 
Much like my family’s festivities 
today, their Christmas Eve had a 
doors open policy — the strategic 
over-preparation 
of 
food 
to 
ensure they wouldn’t run out. 
Everyone leaving full of love 
and food, balancing tupperware 
containers 
of 
leftovers 
on 
their way out. My dad tells me 
my grandfather believed that 
people, no matter who they are 
or what they are, should have 
somewhere to go on Christmas 
Eve, to be around people who 
love them. Around good food and 
good wine, which in our family 
scripture are said to be the 
ultimate offerings of peace and 
harmony. I’m trying to imagine 
what this would look like — a late 
’70s picture in my mind, perhaps 
cigar smoke and laughter fills 
the air; seven, eight, nine, 10 fish 
dishes lining the dining room 
table; white fish buttered and 
sauteed and fried and glazed to 
perfection; pasta with basil and 
crab sauce; a loaf of haphazardly 
torn 
crispy 
baguette 
sitting 
among a pool of grassy olive oil, 
all crackling as they cool, with 
my grandfather’s grace echoing 
into the warm air. I wondered 
what my grandmother did as my 
grandfather spent his afternoons 
and evenings with God in the 
kitchen, mixing and praying. 
Mixing and praying. I never met 
her, my dad and uncle lost her 
when they were my age, but a 
lot of people think she and I are 
quite similar. Isn’t it strange that 
our eyes came from someone 
long gone? I asked my dad what 
her role in this Christmas Eve 
production 
was, 
especially 
considering being Jewish, she 
didn’t 
grow 
up 
celebrating 
Christmas herself.
“She 
was 
the 
master 
of 
ceremonies,” he said without 
much of a thought, and I wished 
to plug a cable into his mind and 
watch his memories project on 
a drop down screen. “She made 
people dance. She made people 
stay. She was the reason the 
evening would run past 10:00 
or 11:00 at night.” I could feel 
his nostalgia effusing from the 
other end of the phone, from 
nearly one thousand miles away. 
“She was the best happy person 
in the world.” I feel as though 

her spirit must still be alive in 
the hardwood floor of our family 
room, where all of our hooligans 
and family members, friends 
old and new, twirl and dance to 
brassy Bruce Springsteen tracks 
and 
holiday 
classics 
before 
dinner on Christmas Eve every 
year.
My uncle tells me the story 
of a year he was sent out with a 
wad of cash from the restaurant 
to pick up a mink coat that my 
grandfather 
was 
giving 
my 
grandmother 
for 
Christmas 
Eve. They always exchanged 
gifts on Christmas Eve because 
much like a small child, the 
anticipation 
killed 
her. 
My 
grandfather wrapped the coat 
in a garbage bag. My uncle said 
he remembers her face when 
she opened it, she cried and then 
slept in it.
When 
my 
grandmother 
passed away, my father, uncle 
and grandfather moved into a 
different home — one that I can 
remember visiting as a small 
girl. It was in this house that the 
tradition first began to mold and 
shift. It is here that my mother 
and her family were invited 
in, bringing with them their 
own customs and scripture. 
Interesting how the people we 
meet and fall in love with have 
traditions too, the marriage of 
two holiday traditions gives 
birth to a completely new one, 
all fresh-faced and sparkling. 
My maternal grandmother says 
some of her first memories of 
my paternal grandfather are at 
his home sharing the Feast of 
the Seven Fishes. She told me 
about the table — a stark image 
— being as long as it had to be in 
order to fit every guest around 
it. My grandfather vehemently 
opposed splitting up the family 
for meals, so instead everyone 
was elbow to elbow. Italians 
believe in closeness. I think most 
prominently in her memory, 
and perhaps the most special 
moments of her first Feasts of the 
Seven Fishes was how fully her 
family was invited to be a part 
of my father’s. My grandmother 
says her favorite memories of 
Christmas 
Eves 
passed 
are 
the table settings, a strategic 
element to my Grandfather’s 
success as a celebrator and a 
gatherer. He always sat my 
mother’s grandfather right next 
to him, bridging the two families 
together at a deeper level than 
just the union of my parents.
As time evolved, the table in 
my grandfather’s house grew too 
small. Suddenly with children 
and spouses and new friends 
to invite inside, the Feast of the 
Seven Fishes didn’t fit at his 
table. Once more, the tradition 
took a new shape, a new face, 
always keeping the same beating 
heart as it forged on through the 
years. My grandfather relocated 
the Christmas Eve celebration to 
his Italian restaurant, shutting 
the doors to the public, which 
is a rarity as the restaurant 
business thrives on Christmas 
Eve. Here he could fit more 
friends, a growing family and 
more spirit than he could before. 
But with new palettes and small 
children the tradition of seven 
fishes didn’t feel right either. He 
altered the menu — still holding 
a candle to the past and those 
lost, but reconfiguring to fit a 
newer group — serving a variety 
of fish dishes, adding chicken 
and pastas, fresh veggies and red 
meat, and of course, thick, soft 
layers of lasagna and crispy, salty 
eggplant parmesan. My uncle 
remembers enormous shrimp 
cocktail, which makes me smile, 
because we still have that at my 
house every year. He tells me 
about snow crab claws the size 
of your hands, a mountain of it, 
piled high on ice. He tells me 
about clam sauce. His intention 
always that there would be 
something for everyone when 
they stepped into his front doors, 
wherever those front doors were, 
whomever the folks were coming 
in from the cold.
It makes more sense to me 
now where this Christmas Eve 
came from — how it was born, 
who gave it breath, who gave it 
life. Why I’ve never had a Feast 
of Seven Fishes, despite the fact

The details have changed. 
They always do. The faces have 
changed too, because that is just 
the way the wind should blow. 
There is no Jewish grandmother 
in a mink coat wrapped in a 
garbage bag, dancing till she 
falls. There is no grandfather 

with worn hands, serving seven, 
eight, nine fishes. But the truth 
in it is the same; the flavors are 
the same. It all comes back to 
the scripture, the recipes, the 
food, the knowledge that in 
ingredients and wine and flavor 
we grieve, we love, we celebrate, 
we come together. It is still an 
open doors policy: You are still 
always welcome, all of you, any 
of you. There will be something 
to eat, something to drink, 
someone to talk to who you’ll 
only see once a year, every year. 
I hope you can come. Everyone is 
invited.

Season one of “The Marvelous 
Mrs. Maisel” ended in a flurry 
of lights and applause. Midge 
Maisel 
(Rachel 
Brosnahan, 
“Crisis in Six Scenes”) was 
high off the end of a successful 
stand-up 
performance. 
Amid 

her crumbling marriage and 
her feuding parents, she was 
rising above it all as a star. It 
was an inspiring ending, one 
that seemed to be the catalyst to 
a continuation of Mrs. Maisel’s 
ferocious fight to become a ruling 
presence in the male-dominated 
industry of stand-up comedy.
Yet, it seems that season two of 
the period comedy had different 
plans. Midge’s heroic stampede 
towards a career in comedy has 
become more a stifled shuffle as 
she has become a backdrop of her 
own starring role. The spotlight 
no longer has a clear target; it 
swings from Maisel’s estranged 
husband Joel (Michael Zegen, 
“Boardwalk Empire”) searching 
for an apartment and purpose, 

to her disillusioned parents Rose 
(Marin Hinkle, “Speechless”) 
and Abe (Tony Shalhoub, “Tales 
from Radiator Springs”) ruining 
and rebuilding their marriage. 
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” is 
more “The Sad Boy Joel Maisel” 
or “The Delusional Abe and 
Rose Weissman,” with little 
opportunity to see what’s so 
marvelous about Mrs. Maisel.
Frustrations with the show 
can be summarized by a single 
scene in episode five. The Maisels 
and Weissmans are away in the 
Catskills, with our star being 
more concerned with trips to the 
salon and swimsuit competitions 
than the variety of gigs her 
driven, sharp manager Susie 
(Alex Borstein, “Family Guy”) 
booked for her. Midge is willing 
to skip the comedy opportunities 
for her break in the Catskills, but 
when she gets the call that the 
department store she works at 
needs her at the Revlon counter, 
she practically jets the 120 
miles back to Manhattan. This 
makes for a short yet wonderful 
little scene, as Midge imitates 
monotone, 
depressing 
news 
radio on the ride back with a 
spunky potential love interest, 
Benjamin 
(Zachary 
Levi, 
“Tangled: The Series”), but it 
sadly highlights what the show 
has become, and where it could 
have gone.
That’s still not to say that 
“Mrs. Maisel” has lost its edge; 
it’s just juggling with it. The 
scenes 
are 
still 
beautifully 

shot, the dialogue still witty 
and quick-paced. Each scene’s 
gaud, movement and backing 
music make for an experience 
that feels as close to a classic 
Broadway musical as television 
can 
get 
(Louis 
Armstrong’s 
“What a Wonderful World” 
soundtracking a walk through 
1950s Paris with your betrothed? 
Um, yes please?). The sophomore 
season isn’t muddled, it isn’t bad, 
it’s just exasperating. Every time 
Midge so much as glances at her 
former husband, you just want 
to scream and remind her that 
he cheated on her even when 
she did everything right, with 
his secretary nonetheless. He 
couldn’t even cheat in a unique 
way, and still his pity party gets 
screen time.
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” 
continues to be better than 
90 percent of everything else 
on television, which is why it 
can afford its stumbles. There 
are glimpses of the old “Mrs. 
Maisel” throughout the first 
half of the sophomore season, 
enough for the audience to 
root desperately for it to break 
through 
completely. 
Faith 
should not be lost in Midge and 
her quest for comedic glory, the 
camera just needs to find its way 
back to her. For now, find some 
joy in Joel’s misery and fondness 
in the Weissman’s revitalized 
marriage. They are just simple 
opening acts to an up-and-
coming, 
astonishing, 
smart-
mouthed comedian. 

‘Mrs. Maisel’ must return 
the spotlight to its true star

Storr battles through adversity

To say that redshirt sophomore 
Kanen 
Storr 
has 
dealt 
with 
adversity over the past year would 
come as no surprise to anyone 
familiar with his situation. And 
during Sunday’s 32-7 win over 
Indiana (2-3 overall, 0-2 Big Ten) 
for the Michigan wrestling team 
(3-0, 1-0), the story was much the 
same, as No. 8 Storr battled through 
adverse conditions to gain a win 
over 15th-ranked Cole Weaver.
Storr came into the match on the 
heels of a rough week at practice. 
Though he typically bases his 
offense on quick feet movement 
and multiple leg attacks, Storr felt 
sluggish and knew he would have 
to get creative in order to win.
And that’s exactly what he did. 
Eventually winning, 3-1, Storr 
managed to get his hand raised 
without scoring a takedown, a rare 
sight for the transfer. Scoring on an 
escape and a crafty two-point near 
fall to start the second period, Storr 
secured the win for his team.
“It was a great performance as 
a team,” Storr said. “Individually, I 
wasn’t feeling too good. I kinda had 
a down week, but overall, I came 
out here, I gutted out a win. I didn’t 
feel my best, so there’s a lot to be 
proud of there but a lot to build off 
of also.”
Circumstances like these are 
nothing new for Storr. After all, 
Storr’s tenure with the Wolverines 
began 
due 
to 
tumultuous 
conditions at his first school of 
choice — Iowa State.
As a high school student and a 
Michigan wrestling standout, Storr 
always had his eyes set on Ames, 
Iowa and the Cyclone program 
headed by Kevin Jackson. From 
the get-go, Storr connected with 
Iowa State’s coaching staff on an 
emotional and professional level.
The relationship truly began 
when Storr traveled to Mexico 
with USA Wrestling and Jackson 
to compete in the Pan American 
Games. Since that moment, Storr 
was sold on the Cyclones’ culture 
and nothing was going to stop 

him from committing, not even a 
strong recruiting effort from his 
hometown Wolverines.
“They really introduced me to 
my faith, they had a philosophy 
of wrestling that I just fell in love 
with, and he had everything I 
was looking for,” Storr said. “And 
Michigan did too, that’s why it was 
really complicated. But then I just 
went with my gut and my initial 
thought of going there, so just had 
a really good connection with the 
assistant staff there.”
But then Iowa State started 
to lose. A lot. Midway through a 
blistering 1-12 season, the Cyclones 
announced they were going to 
scrap Jackson, and with him, the 
assistants that Storr had come to 
know and love.
Wanting to uphold the high 
standard of success Iowa State 
had come to embody, the Cyclones 
brought on then-Virginia Tech 
head coach Kevin Dresser. And 
although the program immediately 
started winning again, Storr felt 
out of place.
“I love Iowa State and the 
community and the fans there, 
but they brought in a new staff,” 
Storr said. “I got recruited by a 
different staff my freshman year. 
Last year they brought in a new 
staff. I was excited to give him a 
shot, chemistry just didn’t work 

out. They’re doing great things out 
in Ames, Iowa right now, so I mean, 
they’re a great staff, good coaches, 
but the chemistry wasn’t there for 
me.
“We didn’t connect on a personal 
level. I wasn’t getting (a positive 
atmosphere) at Iowa State.”
Storr asserts the opposite is true 
at Michigan. The Wolverines focus 
on improvement through positivity 
— an environment more conducive 
to Storr’s personality and, ergo, his 
success.
The first one to defend that 
sentiment is Michigan coach Sean 
Bormet, who has tried to make 
Storr’s transition as smooth as 
possible.
“I think our whole staff has 
a very positive philosophy, and 
I think, in general, kids feed off 
positivity,” Bormet said. “And I 
think kids feed off an environment 
where they’re empowered and 
encouraged to bring their absolute 
best every day and leave everything 
out on the mat every day. And that’s 
really how we approach our entire 
team and our roster, so I think 
Kanen’s been feeding off of that.”
The question has never been one 
of Storr’s wrestling ability. He won 
a ranked match without scoring 
a takedown, after all. Instead, 
it’s been one of comfort, and at 
Michigan, the shoe seems to fit.

Thome struggles with back issue

This year’s version of the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team was said to be senior 
center Hallie Thome’s squad.
She — along with fellow 
senior Nicole Munger — was 
set to fill the void, both from a 
leadership and play perspective, 
left by the departures of Jillian 
Dunston and Katelynn Flaherty.
Through 10 games this season, 
it’s clear that both Thome and 
Munger have adapted to some of 
their newfound responsibilities. 
The Wolverines’ underclassmen 
— who make up a majority of the 
team — continually mention the 
guidance they’ve received from 
their two senior teammates.
Freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon, 
specifically, 
has 
benefited 
from 
Thome’s 
leadership.
“I have to give a lot of credit 
to her,” Hillmon said. “In the 
preseason, she definitely helped 
me a lot and has just given me a 
lot of tips and pointers of how 
to get in the paint, get those 
rebounds. So as much as we 
credit the guards, I’ve got to 
give some credit to Hallie.”
Added Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico: “I think all the 
upperclassmen have taken the 
freshmen under their wing 
and they’re just all terrific 
basketball players. I think for 
Naz, part of the reason she came 
to Michigan was to have an 
opportunity to play with Hallie 
Thome. So I think they love 
being on the court together.”
While the leadership has 
been there, Thome’s recent 
performances on the court 
have 
been 
lackluster. 
Over 
the first three games of the 
season — albeit against subpar 
competition — Thome averaged 
upwards of 21 points per game. 
Since then, she’s averaged just 
9.4.
Thome’s 
unique 
size 
— 
6-foot-5 — and dominant play 
at the end of last year garnered 

the 
attention 
of 
multiple 
WNBA scouts. So far, though, 
that dominant play has been 
infrequent.
Against Oakland last Sunday, 
Thome 
suffered 
from 
back 
spasms, 
which 
ultimately 
sidelined her for much of the 
game. With the contest well 
in hand, Thome played just 12 
minutes and scored six points.
“She’s having some back 
spasms and she has had them in 
the past, sometimes in practice, 
and it takes a little time to get 
through them,” Barnes Arico 
said. “She usually is able to work 
them out, but today they weren’t 
calming down during the course 
of the game. So we decided it 
was best she just rest it.”
Though Thome has dealt with 
them before, back spasms are 
notoriously tricky to manage. 
It doesn’t help that she’s had to 
face consistent double-teams. In 
the North Carolina State game, 
Thome was forced to dish it 
out on numerous occasions to 
perimeter players like Munger, 
who ended up leading the team 
in scoring as a result.
Michigan would obviously 
miss its star player if Thome 
missed time due to injury. With 
that said, the team is well-
equipped to compensate in the 
meantime.
Thome’s relative struggles 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 7-3 record. But 
Hillmon’s 
development 
and 
the play of sophomore forward 

Hailey Brown have softened the 
blow.
“We are not the same team 
without Hallie Thome,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Her leadership 
today when she got hurt was 
still evident. So it’s nice to have 
people that can come in and 
give her a break or, when she’s 
not a hundred percent, take her 
minutes.
“Obviously you can see that 
today with Naz Hillmon. She 
did an outstanding job for us 
rebounding the ball, finishing 
the ball. Hailey Brown did a 
great job stepping up making 
some plays for us, as did 
(junior guard) Kayla Robbins. 
(Freshman 
forward) 
Emily 
Kiser gave us some good minutes 
there as well. But we still miss 
(Thome). We don’t ever want 
her not to be out there.”
Michigan also has a favorable 
schedule over the next few 
weeks — Morgan State and 
Southern will likely be put away 
with or without Thome.
But Big Ten play looms on the 
horizon, with the Wolverines 
traveling to Nebraska on Dec. 
28. If Thome, healthy and 
rested, can regain her dominant 
form, the Wolverines project to 
be a force to be reckoned with in 
the conference.
“Hallie will be fine,” Munger 
said. “She had a really, really 
good workout. She knows what 
she needs to do so she’s gotten 
back in the gym to get her touch 
back. She’ll be fine.”

Bock excels in Maize & Blue meet

Cameron Bock took a deep 
breath and finished his floor 
routine with a flourish in front 
of the judges. The sophomore 
then had a nearly flawless 
performance before a missed 
landing off the parallel bars. 
Bock earned a score of 13.950 on 
floor and took home all-around 
honors with a total score of 
85.250 for the six events.
“I thought I did pretty well 
on everything except for the 
parallel bars, so that was a little 
disappointing.” Bock said. “But 
it’s still the beginning of the 
season so just have to fix those. 
Overall, it was good.”
Bock was a star in the Maize & 
Blue Intrasquad meet Saturday 
afternoon for the Michigan 
men’s gymnastics team.
“Well, two people stood out to 
me,” said Michigan coach Kurt 
Golder. “One is Cameron Bock, 
he did a really really good job 
right down to that last skill, and 
that was his first mistake.”
The 
competition 
dictated 
that four scores count per 

event, but only gymnasts on 
the Maize team competed in all 
six events. The Blue team was 
down just 2.55 points after the 
second event rotation, though 
the Maize team was clearly the 
stronger of the two squads. The 
ultimate goal for the meet was 
not to win, but to prepare for the 
upcoming season.
“I think this is one of our 
better Maize & Blue meets since 
I’ve been here and one of our 
highest hit percentages,” Golder 
said. “I think it sets us up well 
for the rest of the season. I’m 
really looking forward to it.”
Ultimately, the Maize team 
came out on top of the Blue 
squad, 
332.850 
to 
321.800. 
Junior Mack Lasker was the sole 
event winner on the Blue team 
with a score of 14.550 on the 
pommel horse. The Blue team 
found most of its success on the 
pommel horse, claiming three of 
the top four scores.
Junior Justin Murphy of 
the Blue team was named an 
outstanding performer for his 
parallel bars display. Murphy 
had a score of 13.600.
“Justin 
Murphy, 
because 

he had a surgery two years 
ago and struggled all last year 
recovering from it. (He) never 
got in the lineup and then today 
had a really good day,” Golder 
said. “So just on a personal level, 
(I’m) really happy for him.”
It was the Maize team, 
however, that dominated the 
day. Seniors Emyre Cole and 
Matthew Whitaker had strong 
performances as well. Cole had 
the high score on vault, while 
Whitaker took the top spot in 
parallel bars. Bock was the top 
performer in three of the six 
events.
“I’m just trying to increase 
my (all-around) score,” Bock 
said. “Just to push the envelope 
a little bit to get an even better 
score on every event.”
Added Golder: “It’s everybody 
reach their potential, the team 
reach their potential and shoot 
for a national title. I think that 
this isn’t one of the strongest 
teams, but it’s a team that is 
capable of contending for it and 
if you can get into the Super 
Six, you can win it. And we’re 
definitely one of the top six 
teams in the country.”

Jon Teske growing at center spot

When 
Frank 
Martin 
got 
to Crisler Center for South 
Carolina’s practice on Friday, 
he saw junior guard Zavier 
Simpson and pulled him aside.
“Listen, I was watching the 
film from two years ago,” the 
Gamecocks’ 
coach 
recalled 
saying. “You and (Jon Teske) 
were like two kids. … Now, I’m 
watching you guys play. You 
guys are like, unbelievable how 
much better you guys are and 
how different you look.”
Two 
years 
ago, 
as 
the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
found itself on an improbable 
run to the Sweet 16, Simpson 
and Teske — both freshmen 
— largely rode the bench. The 
latter played all of three minutes 
per game, a 7-foot-1 kid whose 
basketball acumen could be 
boiled down to 85 inches.
Even last season, as Teske 
stepped into a role backing 
up Moritz Wagner, he grew 
noticeably, but that archetype 
remained, in large part, correct.
Teske affected shots at the 
rim, threw down the occasional 
lob and usually managed to keep 
the Wolverines afloat when 
Wagner was sitting. Questions 
as to whether he could replace 
the since-departed German in 
full remained.
Just over a month into this 
season, Teske has put those 
questions to rest.
Michigan might be better off 
with Teske starting instead of 
Wagner. The junior hasn’t just 
affected shots at the rim, but all 
over the court. He has turned 
into an example that strength 
coach Jon Sanderson will hold 
up for every big-man recruit that 
walks through the Wolverines’ 
door 
for 
his 
strength 
and 
athleticism improvements.
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first half Saturday, with the 
Gamecocks 
still 
hanging 
around, Teske charged through 

an open lane to put back a miss 
from Simpson. Seconds later, he 
found himself on the perimeter, 
defending 
South 
Carolina’s 
Maik Kotsar. He stayed in front 
of the big man on a drive, then 
blocked his shoot like a dad 
defending his kid in a driveway.
That’s a sequence Teske might 
have been capable of doing once 
in a blue moon last year. Now, 
it’s the norm.
All told, he finished Saturday 
with 15 points on 6-of-9 shooting, 
to go with nine rebounds and 
three blocks over 29 minutes. 
That’s more than he played in 
any single game last year. It’s 
also the fourth time he’s hit the 
29-minute benchmark this year.
That, in part, is a matter of 
necessity. Michigan has yet to 
find a viable backup at the ‘5,’ 
with redshirt sophomore Austin 
Davis struggling and freshman 
Brandon Johns tied to the 
bench.
More 
importantly, 
it’s 
a 
matter 
of 
growth. 
Wagner 
wasn’t the only reason Teske 
never played 30 minutes in a 
game last year. Teske simply 
wasn’t capable of doing so, even 
when Wagner was hurt.
After Saturday’s win, the 

10th straight to start the season 
for the Wolverines, sophomore 
guard Jordan Poole was asked 
whether he thought there would 
be a transition period in the 
wake of last season’s Final Four 
run. He didn’t hesitate in his 
answer.
“No,” 
Poole 
said. 
“Only 
because, where has Michigan 
dropped off in the last couple 
years? Guys leave all the time. 
These coaches do a really good 
job preparing the next guy, next 
man up. That’s our mentality. 
And being able to have guys step 
into the role, it’s just normal. Of 
course you got a Final Four run, 
we had guys who left for the 
NBA. But we’ve been practicing 
against those guys all last year. 
I feel like they set us up for 
success.”
No player exemplifies that 
more than Jon Teske.
“I think it’s just the type 
of kids (Michigan coach John 
Beilein) recruits,” Teske said. 
“He knows he can develop them 
into good players after a couple 
seasons if kids are willing to 
work hard, stay here in the 
summer and work on their game.
“I think that’s what happened 
to me.”

Positive attitude keeps Gingell working toward dream

When college athletes talk 
about how much they love their 
school, it usually comes across 
as canned or cheesy — almost 
like it was the kind of thing they 
were encouraged to say, not 
their true feelings.
But 
when 
Jake 
Gingell 
tells you how much he loves 
Michigan hockey, it’s clear he 
means it.
Sitting in Yost Ice Arena 
discussing 
his 
journey, 
the 
normally confident, emphatic 
freshman 
defenseman 
turns 
quiet. In a voice much softer 
than usual, he’s happy to talk 

about 
what 
the 
Wolverines 
mean to him.
“I still wake up sometimes and 
feel like it’s a dream,” Gingell 
said. “I love every second of it.”
Gingell’s journey to play at 
Michigan started in Sept. 2013, 
when he committed to play for 
Mel Pearson, then head coach at 
Michigan Tech.
But in the fall of 2017, just a 
few weeks before Pearson began 
his first season at the helm of 
the Wolverines, Gingell flipped 
his commitment to Michigan.
“(Pearson’s) 
the 
main 
reason why I came here,” 
Gingell said. “(Pearson) and 
(Michigan assistant coach Bill 
Muckalt) were both coaches 

that recruited me originally to 
go to Michigan Tech, so once 
they came here, I just thought 
it would be best 
that I came here 
with 
them 
as 
well when they 
gave 
me 
that 
opportunity.”
What 
made 
Gingell’s 
decision to join 
the 
Wolverines 
even 
sweeter 
was the fact that 
he’s a native of 
Dexter, Mich., which is just 
about 20 minutes away from Ann 
Arbor. After playing four years 
of junior hockey in the USHL — 

two years in Omaha, Neb. and 
two years in Youngstown, Ohio 
— Gingell was ready to be closer 
to home.
And 
the 
proximity 
to 
home 
wasn’t 
the only thing 
drawing Gingell 
to 
Ann 
Arbor. 
His 
cousin, 
Jason 
Gingell, 
was a kicker for 
the 
Michigan 
football 
team 
from 2005-07.
“I always grew up watching 
Michigan hockey,” Gingell said. 
“My cousin played football here, 
so I’ve just always been a fan of 

Michigan. He’s a lot older than 
me, too, so it’s been for a long 
time.”
When Pearson 
first 
started 
recruiting 
Gingell, 
he 
was 
impressed 
with the young 
player’s attitude. 
And throughout 
his 
junior 
career, 
Gingell 
continued 
to 
display 
the 
attitude 
that 
caught Pearson’s eye. It was one 
of the biggest reasons Pearson 
gave Gingell the chance to come 
to Michigan with him.
“First 
and 
foremost, 
it’s 
just the character,” Pearson 
said. “He’s just dripping with 
character. He’s a hard-working, 
honest, humble young man. 
And then to put on top of that, 
that’s how he plays the game of 
hockey, too. He plays with some 
grit and determination. He’s an 
honest hard worker, and he’s a 
leader.”
That 
hard-
working 
character 
has 
been 
tested 
somewhat 
this 
season as Gingell 
has dressed for 
only one game, 
which 
was 
on 
Nov. 3 against 
Lake 
Superior 
State. 
He 
was 
listed 
as 
the 
seventh defenseman — the one 
who plays without a partner and 
doesn’t have consistent shifts.
But behind the scenes, in 
practice, his work ethic hasn’t 
wavered.
It’s taken Gingell a bit of 
time to adjust to college hockey, 
perhaps because of the two 
years he spent in Omaha playing 
in the USHL. On that team, his 
coach largely used him as an 
old-fashioned 
enforcer. 
The 
majority of his time on the ice — 
which wasn’t much — was spent 
fighting.
In 106 games for the Lancers, 
Gingell 
totaled 
196 
penalty 
minutes.
“He plays tough,” Pearson 

said. “He plays honest. He plays 
physical, 
and 
consequently, 
you get a lot of penalties. He’s 
a strong player. 
He’s probably, if 
not our grittiest 
player, he would 
be right there.”
Now, 
at 
Michigan, 
Gingell 
is 
expected to play 
with a bit more 
nuanced 
style. 
He’s spent the 
majority of the 
season working on his skating 
and puck-handling in practice.
Keeping a positive attitude 
when you aren’t getting in 
games is hard, but Gingell has 
stayed committed to making 
himself the best player he can 
be.
“You’ve just gotta try to 
improve in some way every day,” 
Gingell said. “Instead of feeling 
down on myself, I just try to 
pick something to improve on 
in practice every day. I think 
I’ve been doing that. I’ve been 
making 
crisper 
plays and been 
better with my 
hands and feet, 
and I just feel a 
lot better about 
practices.”
And his hard 
work is not going 
unnoticed.
“He’s 
made 
really 
good 
strides,” 
Pearson said. “He’s made some 
tremendous improvements so 
far. He had to get a little bit 
quicker, had to work on his 
hands and just handle the puck 
and do things a little bit faster 
and quicker and smoother with 
that, and he’s made tremendous 
strides in both those areas.”
Saturday morning, Pearson 
watched Gingell skate before 
the Wolverines’ game against 
Minnesota. He was struck by 
how much more comfortable 
Gingell looks on the ice. 
“Sometimes, it just takes a 
little bit longer for some players 
than others,” Pearson said. “But 
he’s got all the intangibles you 
lo for.”
