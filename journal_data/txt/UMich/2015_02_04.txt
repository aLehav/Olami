Proposed legislation 
would enable high 
schoolers to take 
college courses

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

In accordance with Republican 

Gov. Rick Snyder’s alternative edu-
cation initiative, several bills were 
introduced into the Michigan leg-
islature last week regarding higher 
education.

In his State of the State address, 

Snyder said he aims for Michi-
gan to become the number one 
state for skilled trades programs, 
and praised alternative education 
routes such as dual enrollment for 
high school students and appren-
ticeships.

Dual enrollment for high 

school students

State Sen. Darwin Booher (R–

Evart) introduced Senate Bills 36 
and 37 last week, which would 
allow high school students to 

enroll in community college cours-
es. Should these bills pass, high 
school teachers could receive qual-
ifications to teach certain college-
level classes, which the students 
could subsequently take without 
traveling to a community college 
campus.

Booher, who is the Community 

Colleges chair, a subcommittee of 
the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, noted that concurrent 
courses were the best way to put 
dual enrollment into practice, as 
not all high school students have 
the luxury of commuting to com-
munity college after school.

“Part of the kids that didn’t have 

jobs after school or didn’t have 
some kind of requirement, they 
could go, but not every student can. 
A lot of them have jobs, and a lot of 
them have athletics,” Booher said. 
“This is the fair way to do it; they’re 
already there.”

SB-36 proposes that any “school 

district or public school academy 
may partner with 1 or more post-
secondary institutions or 1 or more 
intermediate school districts and 

Students examine 
self-acceptance 
with spoken-word 

performances

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Inspired by the critical-

ly-aclaimed 
“Vagina 
Mono-

logues,” a dozen University 

students appeared on the Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theatre stage on 
Tuesday night to share their 
experiences 
grappling 
with 

body image.

Sponsored by the Univer-

sity Health Service, the “Body 
Monologues” featured 12 spo-
ken-word 
performances 
by 

University students.

Though 
performers 
often 

stopped during their mono-
logues for comical asides to the 
audience, the performance also 

addressed more serious issues 
such as low self-esteem, eating 
disorders, suicide and sexual 
identity.

Public 
Health 
student 

Tahiya 
Alam 
performed 
a 

monologue titled “Chai Tea or 
Latte?” which discussed how 
her struggles with gaining 
acceptance in both American 
culture and her native Bengali 
culture often made her feel like 
an outsider.

“My skin will always stand 

out in this crowd,” Alam said. 
“Growing up in the Midwest, 
I was landlocked in a sea of 
white, forever an outsider.”

In the monologue “Mischief 

Managed,” Engineering senior 
Jake Heller examined how his 
struggle to accept his weight 
led him to contemplate suicide.

“I truly believed that being 

dead was better than being 
fat,” Heller said during his per-
formance.

Jazz, punk, rock 
and techno all 
have deep roots 

in the city

DETROIT 
— 
From 
Berry 

Gordy’s Hitsville, USA to Emi-
nem’s “8-Mile,” Detroit’s geogra-
phy is strewn with music history. 
But the legacy of Detroit’s music 
runs far deeper than the names 
that first come to mind. It runs 
from the methodic din of facto-
ries, from unsatisfied suburban 
teens and from clubs now shut-
tered.

It’s 
nearly 
impossible 
to 

name a genre that isn’t rooted in 
Detroit this history still affects 
musicians and venues working in 
the city today — from jazz to rock 
to techno.

Detroit jazz and 

a ‘Culture of Mentorship’
Every Tuesday night at Cliff 

Bell’s, the Marcus Elliot Quartet 

takes the stage. Audience mem-
bers order drinks and chat while 
the guys on stage play — eyes 
closed, fingers dancing. Elliot 
leads on saxophone, throwing out 
rolling, brassy swells. He dips off 
stage every now and then to give 
space for another musician to 
solo: Michael Malis on the piano, 
Steven Boegehold on the drums 
or Ben Rolston on the bass.

The quartet all came up 

together in Detroit’s close-knit 
jazz scene, and while they’re all 
still in their early to mid-twen-
ties, they credit much of their 
development and success to the 
long lineage of musicians that 
played jazz before them.

“Detroit has such a deep his-

tory, not only in jazz, but in 
Motown, techno, hip-hop — 
everything,” Elliot said. “It’s 
just really, really deep and I just 
wanted to make sure I tapped 
into that.”

Detroit’s jazz scene stretches 

back to the early 1920s when 11- 
or 12-piece bands like the Jean 
Goldkette Orchestra and the 
nationally 
famed 
McKinney’s 

Cotton Pickers played for crowds

Though 
the 
University’s 

Museum of Modern Art offers 
a number of renowned exhi-
bitions, Tuesday night at the 

UMMA was as much about lit-
erature and science as the arts.

LSA Dean Andrew Martin, 

who assumed the dean’s office in 
September 2014, held a discus-
sion with students in the Mul-
tipurpose Room of the UMMA, 
where he explained both his 
short- and long-term adminis-
trative goals. He held a similar 
discussion in November.

The chat follows the inau-

guration of five new minors by 
LSA for this year’s winter term: 

Yiddish Studies, Arab and Mus-
lim American Culture, Art and 
Design, Intergroup Relations 
Education and Entrepreneur-
ship.

Martin spoke to about 20 

students on a variety of issues, 
including 
interdisciplinary 

studies, the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement and his main pri-
orities as LSA dean over the next 
few years.

He said one of his main goals

in huge ballrooms like the Gray-
stone.

Elliot 
said 
he 
searches 

through record stores to listen to 
new “old” musicians all the time. 
As a Detroit jazz artist, under-
standing his predecessors is 
crucial, he said, because it helps 
contextualize his creative devel-
opment.

“This music’s been passed 

down and passed down and 
passed down, and it would be 
foolish for me to think what I’m 
doing is new,” Elliot said.

Detroit’s greatest contribution 

to jazz, according to historian 
Lars Bjorn’s “Before Motown,” is 
its role in developing “modern” 
or “bebop” jazz.

In the 1950s, much of the 

innovation in jazz was com-
ing out of predominantly Black 
communities establishing their 
own 
entertainment 
districts 

like Paradise Valley. The former 
intersection of Adams and St. 
Antoine fostered clusters of bars 
and “jazz spots,” giving musi-
cians a community to jam and 
experiment. While in Detroit, 
artists like Milt Jackson and 
Yusef Lateef worked to further 
elevate the technical difficulty 
and artistry of their style. Bjorn 
describes the shift as moving 

from “jazz for listeners” to “jazz 
for musicians.”

While Paradise Valley was one 

of the areas destroyed by free-
way construction in the 1960s, 
the community of music has sur-
vived.

Elliot met his bandmate and 

pianist Michael Malis while the 
two were both still in high school 
playing in the Detroit Civic Jazz 
Ensemble. The Civic gave them 
the opportunity to start gigging 
— performing professionally — at 
a young age, and with that came 
the opportunity to play with 
musicians that “define the tradi-
tion,” Malis said.

Malis said the “king” of nur-

turing young jazz talent is Mar-
cus Belgrave, trumpet player and 
Detroit’s Jazz Master Laureate. 
Malis remembered auditioning 
for Belgrave at age 13, but said 
he was wholly underprepared to 
play in a jazz band at the time.

“I thought he was just going 

to send me home with my tail 
between my legs,” he remem-
bered. “He looked down at me 
from above the piano and ‘Yeah, 
you’ll do.’ ”

And that meant Malis “was 

in” even though the group 
already had a piano player. Malis 
said Belgrave even played with 
him that day. That willingness of 
a seasoned professional taking 
the time to play with a kid exem-
plifies the culture of mentor-
ship that exists in Detroit jazz. 
The culture can be traced back 
almost like a family tree.

“The people who he’s come 

from directly are people who 
define what the word jazz 
means,” Malis said.

Ian Finkelstein, a pianist that 

was already in the group that 
Malis joined, said the weight of 
that lineage is important.

“We had the privilege of com-

ing up in that lineage and by 
extension we are continuing it,” 
he said.

All of these young musicians 

have, at one point or another, 
thought about leaving Detroit 
for a bigger city like New York 
or Chicago, but they all stuck 
around because of the people 
they’ve met. The connections 
and opportunities are great, 
they said, but so is the opportu-
nity to continue the legacy that 
raised them.

Punk, rock, Detroit, 

Ann Arbor

At the outset of the 1960s, the 

sound of Detroit ballrooms began 
shifting to something a little 
bit harder. Bands like Iggy, the 
Stooges and the Motor City Five 
were 
bringing 
suburban-spun 

discontent and an entirely new 
music scene into the city.

“(It is) a scene that screams 

for its righteous recognition 
every weekend at every ballroom, 
every shopping center teen club, 
every free concert in the park, 
every time the music is heard 
anywhere,” MC5 manager John 
Sinclair wrote in an early manu-
script now housed at the Bentley 
Historical Library.

The MC5 were staples of the 

punk scene in Detroit throughout 
the ‘60s and the ‘70s, though much 
of their development occurred in 
Ann Arbor. Their music was fast 
and loud, their practice space was 
1510 Hill Street, the location of 
Luther Co-Op, and their first gigs 
were at fraternity houses. They 
were managed by John Sinclair, a 
legendary poet and activist, who 
started managing bands under 
the label “Trans-love Interna-
tional.”

Bands on Trans-love served as 

some of PJ Ryder’s first introduc-
tion to Detroit’s rock scene. Ryder 
now owns PJ’s Lager House, a bar 
at the edge of Detroit’s Corktown 
that showcases live music on deck 
almost every night. He remem-
bers discovering Detroit’s music 
scene growing up in the nearby 

suburb Lathrup Village.

“Do you know what a transis-

tor radio is?” he asked during 
a recent interview in the Lager 
House—a narrow space with 
layers of posters on the wall and 
deep stage that has hosted the 
White Stripes and The Von Bond-
ies, among countless local bands.

“With a transistor Radio and 

a 9 volt battery underneath your 
pillow at night you could listen 
to WKNR and CKLW,” he said. 
“And I listened to those things 
religiously.”

Ryder remembers seeing his 

some of favorite rock musicians 
like The Frost and The UP, anoth-
er band on Sinclair’s label, play 
at high school dances and sock 
hops.

“The thought of it now is just 

so mind boggling,” he said.

The suburbs were brimming 

with anti-establishment music, 
but bands flocked in to play gigs 
in the same ballrooms that had 
been hosting big-band jazz con-
certs a few years earlier.

“I never got out to the Grande 

to the East Town or Punch and 
Judy any of that stuff. I was a sub-
urban white kid,” Ryder said.

The Grande Ballroom (pro-

nounced Grand-eee) served as 
a hotspot for teenagers to dance 
to jazz until 1961— hanging on to 
swing even as its audience flow 
trickled as music tastes changed.

In 1966, the Grande finally 

made the switch after Russ Gibb, 
a middle school social studies 
teacher, bought the ballroom. At 

the urging of John Sinclair, he let 
the MC5 play the first show. The 
group became a mainstay at the 
Grande and filled the venue up 
regularly.

But like the jazz musicians 

before them, Detroit’s rock scene 
was facing a hard fight to win 
over the mainstream.

“The established critics had 

a hard time ‘recognizing’ the 
‘value’ of the new long-haired 
low down music,” Sinclair wrote 
from Marquette Branch Prison, 
after being sentenced for posses-
sion of marijuana, “just as it had 
taken them almost 30 years to 
reconcile themselves to jazz art-
ists that had taken the forefront 
in the 20s.”

The mainstream didn’t catch 

on in time, Ryder said, and con-
cerned 
governments 
started 

shutting down the scene’s life-
blood—the venues. He remem-
bered that the Talking Heads 
were going to play a show at the 
Punch and Judy in nearby Grosse 
Pointe.

“The City of Grosse Pointe— 

this is Talking Heads mind you—
went to court and tried to get a 
stop because they said they didn’t 
want to have punk bands playing 
in Grosse Pointe,” he recalled. 
“And it’s like—punk bands? Real-
ly? Talking Heads?”

This crackdown included some 

drug busts, Ryder explained, and 
ultimately put the “scene on life 
support.” Shows were still pop-
ping in in “oddball kind of plac-

Now in its fifth year, the course 

is dedicated to both understand-
ing the political and economic 
influence of the Super Bowl and 
studying its historical and social 
implications for U.S. culture.

Sports Management Prof. Den-

class will encourage Syracuse stu-
dents to observe the game with a 
“critical eye.”

“I want them to see how things 

have come together, how things 
that they take for granted like the 
Super Bowl were the product of 
various political and economic and 

social forces at work,” he said in an 
interview with The Daily Orange.

Michigan State University 

event raises awareness about 

disabled community

Michigan State’s Council of 

Students with Disabilities hosted 
university faculty, alumni, and stu-
dents at their first Adaptive Sports 
Day on Saturday, The State News 
reported. The event encouraged 
individuals of various identities 
to experience adaptive sports, or 
activities aimed to increase the 
accessibility of physical exercise 
within the disabled community.

Duncan Wyeth, instructor for 

disabled studies and former Para-
lympic athlete, stressed the impor-

tance of adaptive sports for mental 
health, recreational therapy and 
social development.

“Physical exercise has a great 

impact on mental health and emo-
tional well-being. It promotes a 
sense of accomplishment of setting 
and achieving goals,” he said.

MSU student Julia Christensen, 

the Associated Students of Michi-
gan State University representa-
tive to CSD, noted the value of 
learning about disability through 
adaptive sports.

“It’s important for people to 

realize a disabled person can do 
something everyone else can do. 
They just have to do it in a different 
way,” Christensen said in an inter-
view with The State News.

es,” but rock bands were finding 
less and less space in bars and 
clubs.

At this point Ryder moved to 

Ann Arbor, finished his degree 
at the University and opened up 
PJ’s Records—an experience he 
described as a “graduate degree 
in music.” In the early ‘90s, he 
decided to move back to Detroit, 
where the scene was on its way 
back to health, churning out acts 
like the White Stripes, Eminem 
and Kid Rock.

Ryder bought the then-dilapi-

dated Lager House in 1995.

Things have changed a lot 

since he bought the place and 
the city seems to be back on 
the upswing. Today there’s a 
“healthy scene,” Ryder said, with 
shows happening almost every 
night, if you know where to look.

“There’s this whole other level 

that’s constantly churning with 
activity,” he said. “And it to me 
it doesn’t seem like it’s slowing 
down. If anything it’s picking 
up.”

The Birthplace of Techno
In the mid ‘80s, halfway 

between Ann Arbor and Detroit, 
three teens at Belleville High 
School were trying something 
different. Juan Atkins and class-
mates Kevin Saunderson and 
Derrick May, collectively known 
as the “Belleville Three,” are 
widely credited for creating 
the beginnings of what is today 
called Detroit Techno.

In an e-mail interview, Atkins 

said it all began when he talked 
his grandmother into buying 
him a Korg MS-10 synthesizer, 
a keyboard-like instrument that 
creates electronic bass sounds, 
when he was a senior in high 
school. With that gift, he built 
and layered sounds, making 
music not grounded in physical 
instruments, but out of a digital 
realm.

“I would define techno as 

being electronic music made or 

conceived with computers and 
what have you- electronic equip-
ment, synthesizers,” he wrote.

Today the synthesized, elec-

tronic sound that came out of 
Atkins’ early experiments would 
not seem out of place at a house 
party. But at the time, using com-
puters to bring the mechanical 
sounds to life was an entirely 
new endeavor.

Atkins’ friends encouraged 

him to record the new sounds he 
was experimenting with and in 
1981 the trio opened their down-
town disco, the Music Institute, 
where they could play their songs 
for an audience.

Atkins produced prolifically 

throughout the ‘80s, working 
under the name Model 500, and 
when recording with collabora-
tor Rick Davis, Cybotron. Cybo-
tron’s single, “Techno City,” 
introduced the term “techno” to 
brand their futuristic, electronic 
beat.

By the late ‘80s, Detroit techno 

had found an enthusiastic audi-
ence overseas, and many Detroit 
artists found themselves touring 
in Europe.

Alvin Hill, who has lectured at 

the University, has been a DJ for 
over 30 years and said Detroit’s 
place in the history of techno has 
been critical to his development 
as a musician.

“When I think of techno, I 

think of Detroit techno because 
that was my first introduction 
to the word,” Hill said. “Detroit 
techno is very much a reflection 
of the city itself: urban, industri-
al, futuristic.”

Hill explained that his involve-

ment in the techno world began 
when he first met Derrick May of 
the Belleville Three. They spoke 
about opening up a club togeth-
er, and while those plans never 
came to fruition, Hill ended up 
staying in contact with May, 
running May and Saunderson’s 
record labels in the early ‘90s.

Hill said when he met May, 

clubs and record stores were 
the place to go for aspiring DJs. 
Detroit’s clubs were “where 

music was happening,” and were 
what ultimately pushed him to a 
career as a DJ.

“The more I was out at clubs, 

the more I thought just how 
cool DJs were,” Hill said. “They 
took this music and blended it 
together and created this sort of 
journey.”

The Belleville Three’s experi-

mental sounds defined the first 
wave of Detroit techno, the genre 
developing a more blank sound in 
the mid ‘90s, with DJs like Carl 
Craig defining the second wave.

Today’s Detroit DJs have a 

quite different experience from 
DJs of the past. Hill explained 
that the lines between DJ, pro-
ducer and music-maker have 
blurred as the equipment for 
those jobs becomes more widely 
available and user-friendly.

“In the 80s, DJs were DJs, 

there was no expectation that 
you were going to create music. 
But now I think it’s very hard to 
be a DJ if you do not create your 
own music,” Hill said. “Also in 
the ‘80s if you wanted to DJ, you 
had to have records, now you can 
just have to have a hard drive.”

But accessibility isn’t neces-

sarily a good thing for the techno 
industry, Atkins said. Easier pro-
duction methods are a boon for 
quantity, not necessarily quality.

“I think you have a lot of pro-

ductions out there coming from 
people who shouldn’t really be 
making music,” he said. “How-
ever, the technology has allowed 
them to make songs and I think 
that what we are feeling now is 
an onslaught of all of this crap 
music.”

Techno’s Detroit roots make 

the city a special place for EDM 
fans today.

“I think that because this 

movement was started in Detroit 
and we are from Detroit, it made 
Detroit a kind of revered place in 
electronic music circles,” Atkins 
said. “I think that just recently 
have we been getting the acco-
lades that we deserve from the 
city of Detroit and the people of 
Detroit.”

port from the University, and 
there’s been great participation 
in the programs from people 
that are passionate all across 
the university,” Berg said. “It’s 
been great getting input from 
across the University and a 
broad spectrum of stakehold-
ers.”

The PBA 2.0 upgrade allows 

users to make pledges and 
track the success of their goals 
as well as includes personal-
ized information about each 
user’s impact on greenhouse 
gas emissions, waste, dollars 
saved and more.

Berg said the program cur-

rently has about 2,000 active 
and certified ambassadors, 700 
of whom are students.

Program 
Assistant 
Ryan 

Gourley, program assistant for 
the Planet Blue Ambassador 
Program, said an sustainability 
should be embedded in every-
day life.

“Right now in society, sus-

tainability is often treated as 
this separate issue like it’s its 
own field,” Gourley said. “Real-
ly, in an ideal world, sustain-
ability undergirds everything. 
There’s no human activity that 
should occur without an eye 
toward sustainability. It is nec-
essary for both the survival of 
our species and the continued 
well-being of the planet.”

Berg said University-wide 

involvement in energy, food, 
water, waste and community 
sustainability is critical.

“When you get this sort of 

grassroots 
involvement 
and 

input is really where you’re 
going to see the real difference 
made,” Berg said. “We have 
this expertise in our research, 

and our training and opera-
tions in sustainability is some-
thing that everyone can get 
involved in, and we can make a 
real impact at the University.”

Last week, University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel voiced his 
support for the initiative on his 
“On the Agenda” blog.

“As a public institution, 

U-M must be part of our soci-
ety’s 
response 
to 
sustain-

ability challenges on local to 
global scales,” he wrote. “This 
requires meaningful commit-
ments at both institutional and 
individual levels. Our Planet 
Blue initiative unifies all of 
U-M’s sustainability work – 
spanning research, education 
and campus life.”

In 
November, 
Schlissel 

called for a review of the Uni-
versity’s sustainability goals, 
the first round of which were 
scheduled to for completion by 
2025.

The University has seen 

mixed 
results 
in 
making 

progress on the goals, which 
include reducing waste, carbon 
emissions and transportation 
emissions.

The new PBA website, which 

is funded through the Office of 
the Provost and administered 
by the Graham Sustainability 
Institute, also includes team-
based activities for students to 
compete with their friends.

Gourley 
said 
he 
hopes 

the program will eventually 
become part of the campus cli-
mate.

“I would measure the suc-

cess of this program being at 
a point that would render it 
obsolete,” Gourley said. “We 
won’t need a program like this 
because people just automati-
cally choose the sustainable 
option.”

UHS health educator Kellie 

Carbone, a Body-Peace Corps 
adviser and the event’s direc-
tor, said the program focused 
on struggles with body and 
appearance because it is a sub-
ject that students are often 
unable to talk about freely.

“Over the years, I started 

to realize there was real value 
in people telling stories and I 
saw there really wasn’t a plat-
form for students to do that,” 
she said. “Our goal was to get 
people talking and listening 
to stories about struggles with 
body appearance in a support-
ive way.”

“Most of the time people 

suffer in silence about these 
things and then they become 

secrets,” she added. “But giv-
ing a people a space to open up 
about that inspires people to 
take a brave step and do it in 
their own words too.”

At the event, Social Work stu-

dent Hannah Miller spoke about 
her 10-year battle with anorexia. 
She said she hoped the event 
inspired the University commu-
nity to break the silence regard-
ing body disorders.

“I hope that it just spoke to 

at least one person,” Miller 
said in an interview after her 
performance. “There tends to 
be a lot of shame and stigma 
associated with eating disor-
ders. I hope the event encour-
aged someone to get out there 
and break that silence.”

Carbone and the Body-Peace 

Corps are currently planning 
events for Eating Disorders 
Awareness Week at the end of 
the month.

postsecondary 
institutions,” 

thus allowing high school stu-
dents to take college classes 
while in high school. SB-37 
does the inverse, allowing com-
munity colleges to enroll high 
school students.

Jason 
Morgan, 
director 

of 
government 
relations 
at 

Washtenaw Community Col-
lege, said dual enrollment for 
high school students has been 
an option for as long as he can 
remember. The proposed bills, 
however, differ from the status 
quo because students would not 
have to travel to community 
colleges to gain credit.

“Dual enrollment is real-

ly 
beneficial 
for 
everyone 

involved,” Morgan said. “The 
community colleges get addi-
tional students, the students 
get college credit while they’re 
in high school, and the high 
schools get a chance to allow 
their students to take college 
classes without incurring any 
additional cost to the high 
school.”

In 
February 
2014, 
the 

MASCO Foundation provided 
a $150,000 grant to establish 
a partnership between Ypsi-
lanti public schools and WCC 
so high school students could 
earn an associates degree, or 
at least a certificate, with their 
diploma upon high school grad-
uation. He noted that the pro-
viding students the option of 
dual enrollment also provides 
potential economic benefits.

“The long term direction is 

to encourage even more dual 
enrollment with community 
colleges, in hopes that students 
can save money on college right 
off the bat,” Morgan said.

Snyder knows the value of 

dual enrollment as he earned 
25 credits while attending high 
school through dual enrollment 
at Kellogg Community College. 
These credits allowed him to 
earn three degrees from the 
University of Michigan by the 
time he was 23.

State Sen. Goeff Hansen 

(R–Hart) also introduced a bill 
regarding dual enrollment for 
high school students Jan. 28. 
Senate Bill 38 would allow state 
universities to offer academic 
credit for concurrent enroll-
ment courses offered by public 
high schools. Employing the 
same concept behind SB-36 and 
37, high school students then 
would not have to leave campus 
to gain credit from state uni-
versities.

As of now, Ferris State Uni-

versity has a concurrent enroll-
ment program available to high 
schools with certified teachers. 
Under the proposed bill, tuition 
would be free to high school 
students and instead would 
be funded through the public 
schools.

College benefits for

 veterans

In the State of the State 

address, Snyder also highlight-
ed the passage of the National 
Guard Tuition Assistance Act 
— which provides financial aid 
to members of the Michigan 
National Guard attending col-
lege in the state of Michigan.

On Jan. 28, State Rep. Holly 

Hughes (R–Montague) intro-
duced House Bill 4060, which 
would further help veterans 
by informing them during the 
college admission process that 
they can receive credits for 
training completed while in the 
military. Veterans can submit a 
transcript for credits that they 
may have earned and receive 
appropriate credits from the 
university.

Tax credits for graduates
State Rep. Andy Schor (D–

Lansing) and State Sen. Curtis 
Hertel, Jr. (D–East Lansing) 
both introduced versions of a 
bill that would offer students 
who stayed in Michigan post-
graduation a tax credit worth 
50 percent of their student loan 
payments that year.

A similar version of the 

bill introduced at the end of 
2014 stalled, but now is being 
reintroduced as HB-4118. In 
a statement, Schor expressed 
confidence that passing the bill 
could be a bipartisan effort. 
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) 
is a sponsor of the bill.

The proposed bill is based 

on the Opportunity Maine pro-
gram, which allows students 
who graduate from Maine col-
leges to receive an Educational 
Opportunity Tax Credit.

as an administrator is to ensure 
all classes are engaging for both 
students and faculty.

“The environment that I’d 

like to create for the faculty is an 
environment that encourages col-
laboration and encourages exper-
imentation and is a place where 
different types of approaches are 
embraced, to see if they work,” he 
said. “And if they don’t work we 
will get rid of them.”

He noted that he would like 

to maintain the University’s aca-
demic excellence, and added that 
having a competitive faculty body 
contributes to that high quality.

“University of Michigan is one 

of the world’s greatest univer-
sities, and LSA is the country’s 
best liberal arts college,” Martin 
said. “We are the best liberal arts 
college because we have the best 
faculty in the country across the 
board. Across all three divisions 
we have world-class scholars 
who are doing state of the art 
research and are teaching under-
graduates every year.”

To maintain a high level of 

excellence, Martin said LSA is 
planning to review its Race and 
Ethnicity requirement. He added 
that Angela Dillard, the recently 
appointed associate dean for 
undergraduate education, will 
spearhead this effort, working 
with students and faculty to eval-
uate the requirement and amass 
feedback.

He said it would be interesting 

to further integrate the Race and 
Ethnicity requirement into the 
LSA curriculum by potentially 
granting more upper-level class-
es R&E certification.

Last year, the Black Student 

Union called on the University to 
adopt a R&E requirement across 
all of its schools and colleges as 
part of their demands to address 
campus climate and diversity.

On this subject, Martin also 

said one of his main focuses is 
diversity for undergraduate stu-
dents and among faculty. He 
wants to see low rates of attri-
tion across all demographics. He 
added that faculty diversity has 
decreased over the last decade 
possibly due to lack of strategy.

“I will be, in the next month 

or so, charging a task force with 
the job of radically rethinking the 
way in which we do recruitment 
and retention with the eye of 
non-incrementally improving the 
diversity of our faculty,” he said.

Martin added that he wants 

to make access to the University 
easier through scholarships and 
financial aid. He stressed that the 
University’s national standing 
with regard to provision of aid 
needs to improve.

LSA junior Ananya Muku-

ndan, who went to the event 
because she wished to learn Mar-
tin’s mission and his plans for 
improving the campus, said she 
liked his discussion on diversity.

“It’s really important that we 

have frank discussions about 
diversity and how even faculty 
have to get diversity training, not 
just students, and so I really liked 
hearing about that,” she said.

Martin also discussed inter-

disciplinary degrees. He noted 
that LSA’s collaboration with 
some schools like the School of 
Education and Ross School of 
Business is better than it is with 
others.

He said physical distance 

between LSA and the College 

of Engineering, the Penny W. 
Stamps School of Art and Design, 
the Taubman College of Archi-
tecture and Urban Planning, and 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance had been a problem in the 
past — and added that he wants 
to work closer with them in the 
future. Martin also informed the 
students that some LSA classes 
will be taught on North Campus 
starting in Fall 2015.

“I think the thing that would 

be most helpful for my perspec-
tive would be for you students as 

a group to think about what are 
those 
interdisciplinary 
cross-

school undergraduate experienc-
es that would be most beneficial 
to you,” he said.

LSA junior Jennifer Liu, also a 

Business student, said she attend-
ed the event to learn more about 
the expanding interdisciplinary 
nature of LSA. As a dual major, 
she said she feels there is animos-
ity and unnecessary separation 
among schools.

“What he said was promising 

from his point of view, but what 

I would like to see is engagement 
across all different colleges on 
campus and I think that is going 
to take a lot more time and a lot 
more effort,” she said, adding 
that she would like to hear from 
a panel of deans from across the 
University’s colleges.

“I was surprised and some-

what happy with how blunt he 
was,” Liu added. “I think Dean 
Martin comes across as some-
one who wants to be honest with 
the students and who is here to 
learn.”

The embarrassingly minute coverage on 

Boko Haram’s recent escalation in Nigeria in 
both the media and on social media needs to 
be discussed. It seems our national fixation 
on the Middle East and Euro-centric ter-
ror attacks is blinding us from other pressing 
humanitarian issues.

In a country where the epicenter of our inter-

national obsessions lies in the heart of the Mid-
dle East, we are ceaselessly bombarded with 
coverage of ISIS push for dominion in Iraq and 
Syria, usually innately partnered with some 
grainy videos of overzealous jihadists spouting 
their plans for world domination in the greatest 
tradition of Stewie from “Family Guy.”

Nevertheless, while it’s reasonable to make 

light of the ramblings of these mad men, what 
they’re doing in Iraq and Syria is truly grue-
some and inhumane. Reports of hundreds or 
thousands slaughtered seem to come rolling in 
each week, and the psychology of the average 
American’s current obsession with ISIS seems 
to be at least somewhat rooted in the desire to 
see these wolves brought to justice. No doubt 
we have all seen the videos and read reports of 
the beheadings and execution-style massacres, 
and some viscerally American part of our col-
lective soul yearns for the opportunity to bring 
these dirtbags to justice as the self-affirmed 
messiah of the world.

But is that truly the whole story of our obses-

sion with the Middle East? The answer: no, not 
even a little bit.

Without going into the tiresome and played-

out retelling of the history of the U.S.’s Iraqi 
occupation and our other various endeavors in 
the region, suffice it to say that we can agree it 
was clearly our political and economic interests 
that took us down those often-mistaken paths.

At first glance, even the title of the opera-

tion in Iraq —“Iraqi Freedom” — itself seems 
to intimate the aforementioned obsession with 
bringing an end to the struggle and trauma the 
Iraqi people dealt with each day. But if we care 
so much about the slaughter or displacement of 
innocents, why doesn’t anyone in the media or 
on Twitter seem to be fired up about the cur-
rent state of affairs in Nigeria?

Oh, right, because we don’t exactly have any 

pressing interests there.

You have probably heard of Boko Haram 

at least once in the past year, and it was likely 
during the coverage of their abduction of 276 
girls from a school in the village of Chibok. Like 
ISIS and other garden-variety jihadist groups, 
Boko Haram’s modus operandi is essentially 
the same: the establishment of a Shari’a-based 
Islamic state in Africa with the lion’s share of 
attacks carried out against state institutions 
and local police and military forces.

The group was fractured — some “experts” 

believed the fracture to be beyond repair at 
the time — in 2009 after a Nigerian security 
raid on a Boko Haram compound, in which a 
significant amount of their leaders was either 
captured or killed. However, what was left of 
the group recollected to lick its wounds with 
the help of Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, and Boko 
Haram has since slowly escalated its attacks 
with its quickly growing forces and significant 
aid from AQIM.

The numbers are frankly disturbing. Since 

2010, where there were just 75 Boko Haram-
related fatalities during the low point of their 
fracture, the amount has increased each year 
with 569 fatalities in 2011, 1,646 fatalities in 

2012, 2,973 fatalities in 2013 and an alarming 
7,711 fatalities in 2014. In the month of January 
2015 alone, well-known political scientist Ian 
Bremmer reported that the group has already 
slain upwards of 3,000 people in the region.

Where is the outrage and solidarity?
What is even more frightening is the corrupt 

Nigerian military’s lack of any ability to stop 
the streaking Boko Haram insurgents. Cur-
rently, Boko Haram is making a push into the 
capital city of Maiduguri after taking control of 
many of the towns and villages surrounding the 
city. If successful, this push could spell the gen-
esis of the realization of an extremist Islamic 
state in Nigeria.

If we’re being frank, the Nigerian military 

is no match for the current force that is Boko 
Haram, but luckily, African leaders across the 
region have agreed to send 7,500 troops to help 
the ailing Nigerians fight back.

What further exaggerates the sheer weight 

of the geopolitical importance of this issue 
and the farce that is the lack of coverage in 
the media is the possibility that at some point, 
should Boko Haram find success in Nigeria, the 
group could link with AQIM, which already has 
a large presence in much of northern Africa. 
Together, the pairing could wreak significant-
ly more havoc on the region in pursuing their 
dream of a global Islamic caliphate.

All of this sounds like a pressing humanitar-

ian problem, right? Like, one that we might see 
updated regularly on a nightly CNN or World 
News broadcast?

Unfortunately, that’s not the case. The early-

January massacres in Baga — in which Boko 
Haram forces sadistically executed more than 
2,000 civilians over the span of a few days — 
were severely overshadowed by coverage of the 
Charlie Hebdo slayings in France. Though the 
Charlie Hebdo murders were a clear affront to 
freedom of speech and a wanton act of aggres-
sion toward the West, how can that one event 
so heavily overshadow the systematic slaugh-
ter of thousands of innocents over a period of 
four days? While the hashtag “Je suis Char-
lie” quickly became one of the most tweeted 
hashtags in history, nobody seemed to pay any 
heed to the increasingly burdensome daily exis-
tential struggle of innocent men and women in 
Nigeria.

What’s ironic (since we are on the free 

speech trope that was so heavily invoked in 
the coverage of the Charlie Hebdo incident) 
is “Boko Haram” is linguistically the embodi-
ment of anti-free speech: boko is the Hausa 
word for “fake” and haram is Arabic for “for-
bidden.” When combined with colloquially, the 
group’s common name translates to “Western 
education is a sin,” a slam on our world and our 
way of life. With all the brilliant artists of the 
Charlie Hebdo response cartoons, you’d think 
the media could get some pretty good content 
out of that.

Even in our latest obsession with police 

brutality (to which I take no importance from 
and agree with its pressing nature) in Fergu-
son and New York, I see hypocrisy in its high-
est form. In the months of hearing about and 
even participating in marches and vigils for 
these tragically killed Black men, I thought I 
had learned one thing: Black lives matter. Or 
is it just that American Black lives matter?

Je suis Nigeria, anyone?

MATTHEW JACKONEN | VIEWPOINT

I

n what is a now fading spotlight 
on our football woes, the Uni-
versity of Michigan still man-

ages to humiliate 
itself in regards 
to 
our 
Athletic 

Department. Dur-
ing a press con-
ference to address 
the “sports stuff” 
earlier this year, 
University Presi-
dent Mark Schlis-
sel stated that “we 
admit 
students 

who aren’t as qual-
ified, and it’s prob-
ably the kids that we admit that can’t 
honestly, even with lots of help, do 
the amount of work and the quality 
of work it takes to make progression 
from year to year.”

Fast forward to last week, when 

assistant football coach Greg Matti-
son allegedly told a potential recruit 
that he wouldn’t be accepted to the 
University if he didn’t play football.

At a time when we have groups 

kicking down boardroom doors to 
protest the lack of diversity on cam-
pus, Michigan is quietly accept-
ing students that shouldn’t be here 
just because they play a game. 
They then get a whole host of extra 
advantages to which the average 
University student just doesn’t have 
access. Because of this, I think it’s 
time we take a serious look at abol-
ishing the Athletic Department and 
removing these semi-professional 
sports from campus.

There is a major issue with the 

amount of general resources certain 
entitled “student-athletes” use up. 
All over the nation, there’s a con-
cern about players “clustering” their 
majors, with many athletes being 
pushed toward one or two “special” 
programs. Some schools create class-
es specifically for these athletes, and 
in the past, Michigan has proven to 
be no exception.

According to Schlissel, “very 

few” student-athletes are enrolled 
in 
single-student 
independent 

study classes. The number of stu-
dents in these specialized classes at 
any time is very low, and quite pos-
sibly zero. However, since Schlissel 
decided to address these classes, 
they are now relevant to this dis-
cussion, regardless of whether or 
not we have students taking those 
classes 
this 
semester. 
Looking 

at the entire picture, this would 
mean we have students who aren’t 
academically qualified taking up 
classroom seats they don’t deserve, 
utilizing systems that we maintain 

only for the privileged elite, just 
so many of these athletes can miss 
time in the actual classroom to play 
a game.

The system is only going to get 

worse, not better. There are now 
two colleges in the United States 
that offer scholarships for play-
ing the computer game “League of 
Legends.” It’s only a matter of time 
until this program comes to our 
University. You know that kid with 
the puffy, red eyes who looks as if 
he was up all night playing games, 
hitting a bong and eating Doritos? 
That’s possibly only months away 
from being a University-sanctioned 
event (the playing games all night 
part, at least). They may even 
qualify for a scholarship to do that. 
Obviously, we need to put an end to 
this nonsense. Stopping this insan-
ity won’t be easy, though, because 
the 
push 
to 

include these 
programs 
is 

coming 
from 

outside 
the 

University.

Our 
main 

sports 
pro-

grams 
exist 

as 
they 
do 

today primar-
ily because the 
professional 
leagues cultivated them this way. 
Why pay money to establish a farm 
system when you have people will-
ing to pay the costs for you? There 
are now billions of dollars in col-
lege athletics, but the vast major-
ity of that wealth does not go to 
the schools. The NBA and NFL are 
especially egregious in this regard. 
To them, it’s win-win. They use 
these schools to polish their own 
brand, the universities get a lot 
of publicity and TV time and the 
NCAA gets to roll in the cash.

Only one group of people loses in 

this: the students. College athletes 
are essentially free laborers, and 
the powers that be like it. That’s 
why when a bunch of student-
athletes threatened to unionize in 
Illinois, the Michigan Legislature 
moved to block that from happen-
ing here. It’s just not “good busi-
ness” to allow students to get paid. 
After all, the college football mar-
ket is possibly even bigger than the 
pro market, and the NFL generates 
about $9 billion in yearly revenue.

The monetary loss to the stu-

dent-athletes is enormous, but stu-
dents aren’t the only customers that 
are buying this product. Michigan 
Stadium isn’t filled with 100,000 

students and alumni on Saturdays 
during football season. From my 
perception, it’s seems to be mostly 
“Walmart Wolverines,” the fans of 
the team that never attended the 
University, making them the target 
audience. Since they’re the primary 
consumers, non-students and non-
alumni, University resources are 
further privatized. The most valu-
able of those resources is the real 
estate.

It’s impossible to overlook the 

sheer amount of land the Athletic 
Department uses. Michigan Stadi-
um, Yost Ice Arena, the Crisler Cen-
ter and many others athletic sites on 
campus are all land hogs. Instead 
of looking to some of the largest, 
least populated areas of campus 
when the University needed land 
for an over-priced apartment com-
plex, they decided to reclaim the 

five square feet 
(approximate-
ly) occupied by 
Blimpy 
Burger. 

Between the foot-
ball program and 
the 
restaurant, 

only one of those 
two 
businesses 

regularly puts a 
smile on the faces 
of its customers 
(hint: it’s not the 

football program). By freeing our-
selves from the burden of these 
facilities, we’d have more land 
available for student benefit.

In the end, it’s all about money. 

The more our school gets pushed 
toward a “business” and away from 
a “university,” the more these things 
will continue to happen. Our stu-
dents are being exploited for private 
gain, and our state legislature has 
shown it cares more about the inter-
ests of big business than students. It’s 
time to say “enough.” The University 
has enough money. It needs to step up 
and put an end to this charade.

Closing the Athletic Department 

would prove exactly how serious 
the University is about protect-
ing its students and upholding the 
integrity of the institution. Athlet-
ics would still live on at the Univer-
sity in the form of intramural sports 
and extracurricular activities, but 
without a financial motive. By tak-
ing the lead and either abolishing 
or reducing the role of the Ath-
letic Department, we would show 
the world the true meaning of the 
“Michigan Difference.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Learn to love Dolly

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

I have been listening to a lot 

of Dolly Parton lately and I don’t 
really know how to handle it. As 
someone who cringes at the first 
twang of anything resembling 
country music, this feeling is 
particularly surprising. Strange 
things are happening, and I’ve 
decided to go with it.

A few weeks ago, my mom, sis-

ter and I stumbled upon a Dolly 
Parton concert on TV. Catching 
the show just at the start, we were 
intrigued but planned to watch 
only a few songs before inevitably 
switching back to HGTV. Two-
and-a-half hours later, we were 
watching the encore.

This performance took place at 

the Glastonbury Festival in Eng-
land a year or so ago. Parton put 
on a great show, easily command-
ing the stage with high energy 
and flaunting her still-impressive 
pipes. (Not to mention being 
69-years-old and rocking what 
can only be described as a jump-
suit made in sequin heaven.) Ini-
tially skeptical, I recognized more 
songs than I originally anticipated, 
including “I Will Always Love 

You” — which I had forgotten 
that Parton wrote — “Jolene” and 
“Islands in the Stream.”

What struck me most was the 

sheer number of young people 
present to see Dolly — someone 
who, I thought, was entirely off 
of my generation’s radar. Not only 
were they there, but they were lov-
ing it. Some even wore elaborate 
wigs mimicking Dolly’s signature 
blonde locks.

In a time when popular coun-

try music seems to be character-
ized by overly affected southern 
accents and lyrics consisting main-
ly of sunshine and beer, Parton’s 
more classical style is a refreshing 
change of pace. She keeps things 
simple, singing about working and 
fighting hard for who and what 
you love. Her roots seem to lie 
closer to some contemporary folk 
music, rather than the somewhat 
rock-influenced country of today.

My experience with Dolly has 

stuck with me. It led me to explore 
some of the other classic women 
of country – women like Loretta 
Lynn and Patsy Cline. Even in my 
brief listenings, I can’t help but 
notice the soul and swing of their 
music, both in the tone of voice 
and melodies. There is something 

inherently 
jazzy 
and 
honest 

about these women, especially 
with Cline. Hard work, strong 
self-identity and a don’t-mess-
with-me attitude run throughout 
— all classic characteristics that 
southern-raised individuals value. 
Their sound is deconstructed and 
essentially 
unprocessed, 
more 

closely linking them to folk and 
alternative country.

This provides a stark con-

trast to the mainstream country 
genre of today. Long gone are the 
days when simple arrangements 
and acoustic guitars would suf-
fice. This may explain my liking 
Dolly and Patsy, yet avoiding all 
things Florida Georgia Line – for 
the most part, I like things to be 
kept simple. There is something 
much more sincere to me about 
a stand-out voice, rather than a 
singer always backed by a heavily 
layered melody.

I know that I will never 

become a full-fledged country 
fan, but I have come to embrace 
the roots of the genre and its 
widespread 
influence. 
Who 

knows, maybe the mainstream 
millennials will come to appreci-
ate the soulful simplicity of Patsy 
Cline just as I have.

ALBUM REVIEW

Radio-ready, but out 
of tune ‘Reflection’

By GREGORY HICKS

Daily Arts Writer

Fifth 
Harmony’s 
much-

anticipated debut, Reflection, is 
plagued with an angry mob of 
fans who have 
a bone to pick 
with the solo 
distribution 
of the record. 
Despite Camila 
Cabello being 
one 
of 
the 

weaker 
voice 

boxes in the 
quintet, she takes the reigns 
on the majority of the record’s 
made-for-radio tracks — stir-
ring up quite a frustrated mess 
from the group’s fan base that 
ranks priority by talent.

That’s not how pop music 

works.

A weaker voice tends to be 

more digestible for pop music 
and the world doesn’t need four 
Christina Aguileras hovering 
over the microphone every 
given 
second. 
The 
record’s 

producers 
deemed 
Cabello 

the group’s X-factor, so c’est 
la vie, Fifth Harmony. There’s 
no need for the Pussycat Dolls 
treatment.

Reflection may not have the 

solo showcases that fans wanted 
and it may not be booming with 
innovation, but it does display 
pop savviness. The beats are hip 
hop-oriented, the lyrics lean 
toward 
independent-female 

anthems and then there’s the 
recurring 
brass 
instrumen-

tation continuously heard in 
the latest “Problem” (Ariana 
Grande), “Shake It Off” (Taylor 
Swift) and “Talk Dirty” (Jason 
Derulo) hits. Coast through the 
first half of the record (“Top 
Down,” “Boss,” “Worth It,” 

etc.) and you’ll find more than 
enough of these characteristics.

And in the event that teen 

girl hip hop isn’t your cup of tea, 
Meghan Trainor and Dr. Luke 
have tailored a few hyper radio-
friendly EDM tracks for you. 
With pen and paper in hand, 
Trainor whipped up the pul-
sating smash “Sledgehammer” 
— the group’s most recent hit 
— while Dr. Luke concocted the 
party-licious “This Is How We 
Roll,” which reintroduces the 
atonal, bouncing synth chorus 
that will.i.am brought to radio 
with “Scream and Shout.”

The record’s writing and 

production becomes stale after 
the heavily sampled seventh 
track “Like Mariah,” but given 
that this is a debut in a world 
of low sales, it’s wise not to 
scatter the potential singles in 
the sequencing of the album. 
Momentum is key, after all, and 
there’s quite a bit — even if only 
for a short while.

That being said, the pop net 

is cast pretty wide here, so radio 
will most likely eat it up the 
first chunk of Reflection. And 
given the absence of a domi-
nant girl group on the market, 
the industry will probably give 
Fifth Harmony a push. After 
all, they’ve got that sexy, seduc-
tive, 
looks-like-a-12-year-old-

girl brand that all the kids are 
so into these days — just in case 
Ariana’s act isn’t uncomfortable 
enough for everybody.

Just don’t creep too far into 

the realm of diva branding, Fifth 
Harmony. Shying away from the 
super teeny-bopper tracks of 
Better Together was a move in 
the right direction, but visually 
speaking, the group appears to 
be taking themselves quite seri-
ously for a group of teenage girls 
who have been in the industry 
for all of half a second.

You’re starting things off on 

the right musical foot, so crack a 
smile, ladies.

Which one is Posh Harmony?

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA

Daily Life Editor 

Editor’s Note: This semester 

we’re launching a new Life section 
within the paper. We’re beginning 
this endeavor with a few individual 
installments with stories related to 
healthy eating, fitness, and mental 
health. Our goal is to provide infor-
mation relevant to college students 
and to help interested readers lead 
happier, healthier lives. 

When LSA senior Lisa Schlos-

berg walked into the newsroom 
at 420 Maynard for her inter-
view, I thought I knew what she 
would say. I knew that she used 
to weigh around 300 pounds and 
lost 150 pounds during her sopho-
more year at the University. This 
was supposed to be a tidy 600 
word article on how to maintain 
weight loss on a college campus 
from someone who’d been there. 
Over the course of our 90-minute 
interview, however, I learned that 
host of complexities associated 
with losing weight. It’s not just 
a physical journey, but a mental 
journey. 

Healthy eating

At first, it seems simple.
“I lost a lot of weight sopho-

more year,” Lisa said. “I was 
overweight my whole life, after 
freshman year here I started 
Jenny Craig and did that for seven 
months before taking it into my 
own hands and dieting myself.”

Though some people who 

decide to lose weight report an 
“aha moment,” Lisa said she’s not 
sure what prompted her to make 
such a drastic change to her life, 
especially because she was usu-
ally happy before losing weight.

 “It’s the one question everyone 

asks me that I still don’t have an 
answer for. It was just time,” she 
said. “I took a gap year before 
college and I think going abroad 
and being alone and indepen-
dent kind of set me up so I could 
do something like that. For me it 
wasn’t what it is for a lot of peo-
ple: I wasn’t bullied, I wasn’t sad, 
I didn’t hate what I looked like. I 
just needed to do something for 
myself.” 

Lisa said she’d been over-

weight her whole life, but never 
felt compelled to do anything 
about it because she wasn’t 
interested 
in 
understand-

ing nutrition or how to live a 
healthy lifestyle. She’d been on 
a slew of diets growing up but 
none of them stuck because her 
heart wasn’t in it.

“My parents tried and tried, 

but there’s only so much you 
can do for a kid who has no 
interest in losing weight,” she 
said. “This time was different. I 
couldn’t count points — I wasn’t 
doing that again. I just followed 
the rules and did what I had to 
do and I saw it start working so 
that was good.”

Lisa selected the Jenny Craig 

program because she said it 
was like dieting for dummies.

 “When I first started I had 

no idea how to eat right, even 
if I wanted to. I had no nutri-
tional knowledge and I had no 
interest. I just thought, ‘If I 
have to go through this, let’s 
make this as easy as possible.’ ” 

Lisa began the program, 

seamlessly 
replacing 
her 

favorite foods with the pre-
portioned food sent in boxes 
by Jenny Craig. While it may 
seem like a tough adjustment, 
Lisa opened the first box and 
never looked back. 

“When I started Jenny Craig 

I think I was on 2,300 calories 
and then as you go you drop 
off hundreds of calories. They 
give you snacks and dessert 
and from the very beginning 
I thought I didn’t need snacks 
or dessert, or dressing on my 
salad. I cut it all out from the 
beginning 
and 
I 
shouldn’t 

have. I really didn’t know any 
better.”

Lisa said she learned a lot 

from her weight loss consul-
tants, including the difference 
between good and bad fats, 
why fiber is filling and how to 
incorporate protein into meals. 
But because of the nature of 
the program, she didn’t have 
to apply what she learned. She 

just had to eat the food they 
sent.

 “Once I started everything 

was black and white, things were 
allowed and things were not,” she 
said. “I wasn’t patient. I wasn’t 
lenient. I was trying to lose as 
much weight as fast as possible.”

After seven months on the 

program, Lisa decided that she 
could lose the rest on her own and 
decided to take dieting into her 
own hands. She knew that as she 
lost weight she was supposed to 
eat less, so she began restricting 
her caloric intake even further 
and continued to drop weight. 

 “On one hand I learned a lot. At 

the same time, they didn’t teach 
me enough and I don’t blame 
them, but I wasn’t prepared to do 
what I thought I could.”

Though losing weight didn’t 

change her personality, Lisa said 
the extreme measures she took to 
shed pounds often did. December 
2013, she realized she was getting 
dizzy and saw black spots in her 
vision a lot. She wasn’t hanging 
out with her friends because her 
life revolved around making food, 
avoiding it or working it off. It 
was around this time she recalls 
she didn’t want to eat at all, and 
that her health began to decline. 

“I remember calling my mom 

from the library during finals 
and telling her I couldn’t study or 
see straight. I went to doctors for 
those few months and trying to 
get to the bottom of why I felt like 
shit all the time.”

Lisa said she was told repeat-

edly that her symptoms were side 
effects of her rapid weight loss, 
and that with time and mainte-
nance her mind and body would 
recover. But because she still 
had 15 pounds to lose before she 
hit her goal weight, Lisa ignored 
their advice and continued con-
suming fewer calories. 

“That summer, I hit the worst 

plateau and couldn’t lose any 
weight, so I spoke to a nutrition-
ist. She told me I was literally 
starving myself and the whole 
summer became about trying to 
reverse it.”

Lisa said it was at that point 

she wasn’t able to recognize her-
self or how she’d let it happen. 

“I was in Ann Arbor over the 

summer and I never wanted to 
go out to eat. If people went out, 
I made excuses not to go. I was 
never that person. I love drink-
ing and I love getting drunk with 
my friends. I love to eat and I love 
food and I love going out with 
my friends to eat food. I’m not a 
scared, paranoid person and I’m 
spontaneous, and that’s when 
I realized this had taken away 
everything. I wasn’t at all who I 
used to be.”

“It was obvious to me that my 

entire life had been an eating dis-
order, either it was overeating or 
it was under-eating.”

Fitness

In addition to changes in her 

diet, Lisa committed to exercis-
ing for the first time, though 
she’d worked with trainers off 
and on in the past. Initially it 
wasn’t fun. 

“I hated exercise, but I did 

it all the time. From the very 
beginning I would work out 
twice a day,” she said. “I would 
swim after my lifeguarding shift 
and go home and do cardio at the 
gym. I really, really hated it so 
much, but it was just like every-
thing else, I had to do it. All I did 
was cardio because I wanted to 
burn calories.”

Lisa said she was motivated by 

her own progress and strived to 
be a few seconds faster every day. 
She stuck to cardio because she 
didn’t know much about work-
ing out, but knew that if she was 
sweaty and out of breath, she 
was doing something right. 

“Months later, I started to 

realize I was kind of enjoying 
this and the way it makes me 
feel. I never, ever thought that 
would happen. Months and 
months later I started getting 
into lifting and strength train-
ing, but when you’re so used to 
cardio it doesn’t feel like any-
thing,” she said. “Now I love it, 
working out is my favorite thing. 
It’s how I blow off steam. I do it 
every day. I do Insanity DVDs a 
lot; I love running. I pretty much 

do everything.” 

Lisa has come a long way since 

her first 17-minute mile and has 
even taken the steps to become 
a certified personal trainer. Lisa 
said she’s not sure if she wants 
to make a career out of personal 
training or how long she’ll be 
doing it. 

“I don’t know where I’m going 

to be after graduation and I’m not 
looking for a long-term career, so 
at this point there’s no better job 
than working in a gym and help-
ing people lose weight,” she said. 
“I can’t think of anything I’d 
rather do, so I have the opportu-
nity to do this, time-wise.” 

As excited as she is for oppor-

tunities to pursue fitness at a 
higher level, Lisa admits she 
never saw it coming, even as she 
began her own journey. 

“I always heard about people 

who would lose a ton of weight 
and become a personal trainer 
and I thought that was never 
going to happen to me and now 
I’m that person, I’m so that per-
son.”

Mental health

Lisa said when she began los-

ing weight she thought it was 
going to be solely a physical 
journey. She thought she would 
be thinner, but her life would 
stay the same. Though her 
journey has had many ups and 
downs, Lisa said she’s a stronger 
person physically and mentally 
after what she went through. 

After losing more than 150 

pounds and then struggling 
with an eating disorder, Lisa 
said she applies the dedication 
and mental toughness to every 
aspect of her life and that now, 
everything is possible for her 
mentally. 

“I thought I was just going 

to wake up thinner and move 
on with my life and that’s so far 
from what has happened. I feel 
like I can do anything, I know 
how to talk myself up and be 
positive and self motivated and 
dependent on myself, so that 
helps in everything I do all the 
time.” 

Lisa said that her close 

friends have had only positive 
things to say about her trans-
formation and that nothing 
about that aspect of her life has 
changed.

 “I feel to the core, I’m the 

same person and I always have 
been,” she said. “Having con-
sistent people is a testament 
to that. I’ve heard countless 
times that nothing has really 
changed, and I’m grateful for 
that. I wasn’t losing weight to 
look good, so I never had the 
mindset of a social climber that 
was going to get skinny and get 
cool, but there are for sure peo-
ple who have treated me differ-
ently. There are people who are 
more friendly now and they’ll 
comment on all your Facebook 
pictures and don’t even try to 
hide how transparent they are.”

However, Lisa added that 

she’s noticed people she’s not 
close with often treat her dif-
ferently now that she’s thinner, 
from boys to bartenders. 

“I remember walking into a 

frat here freshman year, and I’ll 
literally never forget this guy 
opening the door and glaring at 
me. I knew exactly what it was, I 
was 300 pounds and with my hot 
freshman girl friends. I didn’t 
want to think about the fact that 
it was because of how I looked, 
but I knew. There were moments 
like that all the time.”

Lisa said she realizes she was 

more or less “ignored” before she 
started losing weight, and that 
“skinny privilege” was some-
thing she gained by slimming 
down. 

“I didn’t know I was uncom-

fortable until I knew what it was 
like to feel comfortable in social 
situations. It’s so easy for me 
now,” she said. “I don’t think that 
most people take it for granted 
being a normal weight and an 
able bodied person, but once 
you’ve gained enough weight to 
be on the other side you know 
how society works and it’s disap-
pointing.”

BUDWEISER

Drunk in puppy love.
Super Bowl Ads 2015: 
Beer, girls & fungus 

By ALEX INTNER and 

DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writers

If Seattle fans didn’t have 

enough reasons to suffer, the 
commercials gave them plenty. 
Between dead children, lame jokes 
and an egregious amount of use-
less celebrity cameos, this year’s 
crop of commercials were the 
darkest and most cynical in recent 
memory. Fortunately, there were 
some gems in the muck, as well as 
some heinous creative decisions to 
make Seahawks Offensive Coordi-
nator Darrell Bevell feel a little less 
self-conscious.

Best: Budweiser – “Bond of 

Clydesdale and Pup”

There were a lot of commer-

cials this year that attempted to 
pull on the heartstrings, but the 
recent gold standard for this type 
of ad has been Budweiser and 
its team of animals. This year’s 
ad focused on a puppy’s journey 
home after getting lost, with a 
Clydesdale saving it from a wolf 
on the way. It brought out emo-
tions in the right way since it 
focused on a cute puppy and its 
friendship with the horse. It was 
simple, but effective.

Worst: Nationwide – “The 

Boy Who Couldn’t Grow Up”
It’s one thing to make a state-

ment about a real issue in Ameri-
can society like accidental child 
death. It’s another to do it in a 
Super Bowl ad that comes off as 
manipulative. This ad missed the 
mark in almost every way. Instead 
of coming off as a conversation 
prompter, it was unnecessarily 
depressing and dour. Even worse, 
Nationwide actually did a solid job 
with its Mindy Kaling ad earlier in 
the game. Maybe if the company 
had followed Coke’s model, which 
raised awareness of cyberbullying 
in its “#MakeItHappy” campaign, 
Nationwide could have made a 
better spot.

Best: Always – “Like A Girl”
The Super Bowl might not 

be the best time for a public 
forum about gender inequality, 
but you have to give Always and 
the team behind the #LikeAGirl 
campaign props for giving it a 
try. Even if certain aspects of 
the ad felt staged, the young 
women in front of the camera 
expressed a commendable hon-
esty lacking in most big-name 
commercials. “Like A Girl” 
didn’t pretend its company sat 
on a pedestal of higher morals, 
nor did it become too trite or 
preachy. Instead, the commer-
cial hijacked the airwaves for a 
couple of seconds to talk about 
something actually interesting 
to listen to, even if it wasn’t the 
most effective advertisement 
for the product.

Worst: Weight Watchers – 

“All You Can Eat”

Wow, what an ugly piece 

of garbage. This year had a 
plethora of horrendously exe-
cuted attempts to be progres-
sive, diverse and bold. Most 
of them, however, came off as 
pretentious and mean-spirited. 
Despite what Weight Watch-
ers wants you to think, eating 
a cheeseburger is a far cry from 
selling your life savings to buy 
heroin. Health is indeed an 
issue — as is body image — but 
to artlessly formulate a PSA-
like message to America say-
ing, “join Weight Watchers, you 
fat, stupid drug-addicts” only 
did more harm than good. It’s 
even more tragic that it was 
a well-made montage with a 
solid voice-over from Aaron 
Paul (“Breaking Bad”). Had it 
been for a documentary, that 
would be one thing, but Weight 
Watchers is a multi-million dol-
lar corporation, not an indepen-
dent docudrama from Morgan 

Spurlock.

Best: Bud Light – “Pacman 

Up for Whatever”

In what could be described 

as a year with several dour ads, 
commercials that hit the mark 
with comedy stuck out above 
the rest. While the conceit of 
a real life game of Pacman is 
silly, it worked in the context 
of a Super Bowl ad. It was a fun 
minute-long spot that made us 
laugh much more than others 
did.

Worst: McDonalds – 

“Lovin’ It”

Opposite Weight Watchers’ 

pretentiousness is McDonald’s 
pandering sappiness. Yes, run-
ning a company with a reviled 
reputation 
to 
rival 
British 

Petroleum doesn’t leave a lot 
of room for friendly face-time 
with American viewers, but 
this attempt at communalism 
just felt like the company was 
giving up. Instead of dispelling 
any legitimate concerns about 
its food, McDonald’s went for 
the lowest common denomina-
tor, and in doing so, only made 
the fast-food empire seem even 
more out of touch.

Best: Discover – “Surprise”
There were plenty of medio-

cre Super Bowl commercials 
that followed the easy formula 
of saying the absurd (like a 
flying pig), then showing that 
in the next frame like a lame 
granduncle elbowing you in the 
rib, begging you to laugh. That 
kind of joke-telling is lazy and 
tired. If a commercial wants to 
actually surprise, then surprise. 
The Discover “Surprise” com-
mercial was like a parody of this 
tired cliche. It was everything a 
good Super Bowl commercial 
should be: creative, witty, light 
and above all, surprising. The 
fact that it lacked dead children 
was also a plus.

Worst: Jublia – “Tackle It”
There were several first-

time advertisers in the game, 
attempting to bring their prod-
ucts into the national spot-
light. None stuck out more than 
the ad for Jublia, a drug that 
removes toenail fungus. The 
ad effectively communicated 
what the product is and what it 
does, but it felt more gross than 
entertaining. This writer is not 
sure if spending $4.5 million to 
show hors d’oeuvres-munching 
Americans what toenail fungus 
looks like was a good idea.

‘Suits’ promises 
a thrilling finish

TV REVIEW

Midseason premiere 

is addictively 
suspenseful 

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

On its surface, USA Network’s 

“Suits” has a tired plot. Focused 
on two lawyers in a swanky New 
York City law 
firm, every epi-
sode brings a 
new case for the 
Armani-clad 
greyhounds 
to 
scrutinize. 

Sophisticated, 
yes, maybe even 
inspiring for the 
anxious gradu-
ate pining for 
acceptance from 
Harvard Law, but what makes 
“Suits” entertaining enough to be 
thriving in its fourth season?

Like any good case, the answer 

is in the details. The premiere of 
season one introduced Mike Ross 
(Patrick J. Adams, “Friday Night 
Lights”), a brilliant college drop-
out who was expelled from school 
after selling a math test to the 
dean’s daughter. With his dream 
of getting into law school dashed 
by the expulsion, Mike makes a 
living taking the LSAT for others, 
proving that he knows the law 
better than any aspiring attorney. 
Seeking an escape from the cops, 
Mike unknowingly stumbles into 
the lobby of Pearson Specter law 
firm. There, dozens of young Har-
vard graduates are waiting to be 
interviewed by Harvey Specter 
(Gabriel Macht, “Love & Other 
Drugs”) as his new associate.

Harvey, infamously the “best 

closer in the city,” bemoans the 
thought of dragging along one of 
these bookish newbies with him, 
but Mike’s disheveled appearance 
catches his eye. In a tense interro-
gation, Mike reveals that he didn’t 
graduate from Harvard (a staunch 
requirement for the associate 

position) or any law school for 
that matter. Nor does he even have 
a college degree. What he does 
have, however, is the brain to beat 
Harvey at his own game — a feat 
greater than any Harvard degree. 
Brushing all rules aside, Mike is 
hired to be second-in-command 
to New York’s best attorney. And 
Harvey must keep Mike’s secret, 
or risk losing his brilliant associ-
ate, his law license and the firm as 
a whole. Suddenly, a “suit” doesn’t 
necessarily mean a lawyer, but 
simply a fast-talking genius in a 
suit. What makes “Suits” so addic-
tive is the suspense: namely, can 
Mike pull this off?

The show’s fourth season pre-

miered this past June, opening 
with a very different situation 
than in previous seasons. Fearing 
that his fraud is too much of a risk 
for the firm, Mike has left Pearson 
Specter and accepted a job working 
for an investment banker. Things 
get heated when Mike’s new com-
pany faces one of Harvey’s clients, 
Logan Sanders (Brendan Hines, 
“Lie to Me”) in a takeover battle 
for ownership of Gillis Industries. 
To make matters more awkward, 
Mike’s girlfriend Rachel (Meghan 
Markle, “Remember Me”), Pear-
son Specter’s best paralegal, has a 
past with Logan and may have lin-
gering feelings for him. The case 

is thwarted, however, when Mike 
gets fired because of a rumor that 
he’s planning to cut the company 
out of the deal.

If “Suits” teaches us anything, 

it’s that leverage on someone is 
more valuable than any paycheck. 
The man behind Mike’s firing 
turns out to be Louis Litt (Rick 
Hoffman, “Jake in Progress”), a 
jealous attorney in Pearson Spec-
ter who has never measured up to 
Harvey. But when his shady deal 
comes to light, Litt resigns from 
the firm. The absence is short-
lived, though, because after a fatal 
visit with Mike, Litt uncovers the 
fraud: remembering that each 
Harvard Law magna cum laude 
graduate receives a golden key, Litt 
reasons that Mike should own one. 
But Mike knows nothing about a 
key. Click. Litt’s reward for keep-
ing the secret? Being re-hired as a 
partner by the firm, under the new 
name of “Pearson Specter Litt.”

Directed by lead actor Macht, 

the mid-season premiere is a dead-
ly dance between the walls of the 
firm as Litt, after years of being 
treated as second-best, unleashes 
his wrath, intent on making both 
Harvey and Mike suffer. The thing 
about lawyers, though, is that 
they have a funny way of flipping 
leverage back around — especially 
when it’s personal.

No glitter for this vampire.
Intense indie film
transcends genre

‘A Girl Walks Home 

Alone’ artfully 
blends cultures

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Budding screenwriters have 

it hard. There are more people 
writing great scripts than can be 
produced, 
let 
alone 

recognized 
enough 
for 

their auteur 
to break into 
the elite cir-
cles of cin-
ematic fame. 
But 
writer 

and 
direc-

tor Ana Lily 
Amirpour’s (“A Little Suicide”) 
feature film debut “A Girl Walks 
Home Alone At Night” flags her 
as someone to watch. She brings 
a refreshingly new perspective to 
film, which is evident in her work. 
Priding itself on being the first 
and only Iranian Vampire West-
ern flick ever made, “A Girl Walks 
Home Alone” seamlessly collages 
heritage and genre.

Amirpour’s home state, Cali-

fornia, acts as a stand-in for the 
fictitious Iranian Bad City. Here, 
everything slumps and every-
thing is still. Moody black-and-
white shots track desolate night 
streets and the wayward inhab-
itants who traverse them. Only 
by day do oil refineries grind 
on. Still, they’re no less greasy 
than the community surround-
ing the protagonist Arash (Arash 
Marandi, “Kunduz: The Incident 
at Hadji Ghafur”), a James Dean 
figure struggling to support his 
father, who turns to costly vices 

after his wife’s death and grows 
addicted to drugs and women. 
Next, we meet the purveyor of 
said drugs, a pimp with “SEX” 
tattooed in capital letters across 
his Adam’s apple. Along with him 
is the beautifully sad 30-year old 
prostitute he controls. And of 
course, there’s the mysterious girl 
walking home alone at night, a 
seemingly omnipresent vampire 
who quietly observes everything 
and instills her own, vengeful ver-
sion of justice on Bad City.

This film can tack any num-

ber of genre labels onto its name 
because it draws from an astound-
ingly broad camp of elements. 
It smashes opposites together 
and turns the typical on its head. 
Already, The Girl (Sheila Vand, 
TV’s “State of Affairs”) ignores 
the cultural mandate that comes 
with being a girl and walks slowly, 
purposefully into the dead of the 
night. When she stands face-to-
face with a sleazy pimp, we dread 
what’s to come, and for once we’re 
not scared for her – we’re scared 
for him. She has confrontations 
that, while subtle, are truly terri-
fying, just by the force of her all-
knowing gaze.

What’s more, the film’s blend 

of American and Iranian cultures 
earns the hyphen that third-gen-
eration immigrants so desperately 
need: Iranian-American. The Girl 
dons black chador, stylized as 
her vampire cape, on her nightly 
rounds. In the all-black garment 
that many Americans stereotype 
as a sign of submissiveness, The 
Girl cuts a powerful, imposing 
figure. Yet underneath, she wears 
jeans and a striped T-shirt, and lis-
tens to Lionel Richie under Christ-
mas lights and poster-strewn 
bedroom walls. This film – origi-
nally a short – first premiered in its 
full length at Sundance Film Festi-

val under an American production 
company. Though the dialogue is 
almost entirely in Farsi, this isn’t 
a foreign film. It’s deeply Ameri-
can, representing an immigrant 
identity etched into the base of 
the Statue of Liberty – an identity 
lived every day by millions across 
the country, but one that has rarely 
found its way into media.

For all its intertwined con-

ceptualism, 
“A 
Girl 
Walks 

Home” asserts itself slowly and 
quietly. The sparse set, mini-
mal dialogue and long-track 
cinematography are impecca-
bly complemented by a blend 
of Iranian-pop and American 
rock songs. Everything gives 
heed to the characters and 
their actions. Therein lies “A 
Girl Walks Home” ’s only flaw: 
though artistically gorgeous and 
intensely 
thought-provoking, 

the plot is not very complex. 
Nor are the characters deeply 
fleshed-out enough to carry the 
slack. Vand’s evocative perfor-
mance, deftly shifting between 
ferocity and fragility, aloofness 
and determination, cannot be 
the only force connecting the 
audience to the characters. We 
empathize with them, but only 
as we might out of general curi-
osity. It needs to feel like we are 
personally linked to their fate, 
and we aren’t enough to under-
stand their motivations.

Still, there’s no denying the 

film’s many virtues. Though a 
little too slow-moving than it 
should be, “A Girl Walks Home 
Alone at Night” balances richly 
layered thematic concepts and 
a minimal artistic vision well. 
It’s everything it needs to be: an 
unconventional romance, subtle 
horror, a glorious mix of campy 
movie genres and just exquisitely 
well-made.

If you gaze long enough into the abyss, you still won’t find your shoes.
‘Hyperview’ is Title 
Fight’s new paradox

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

Not much of Title Fight’s 

third album, Hyperview, will 
sit particularly well with fans 
of 
shoegaze. 

While 
it’s 

true that the 
band is (was) 
a 
traditional 

punk 
group, 

they seem to 
want to break 
into a differ-
ent sphere of 
guitar-focused noise rock. Add 
a few dream-pop riffs, wobbly 
rhythm solos and sprightly bass 
sections and you get Hyperview, 
more or less – a sort of synthetic 
drawl that blends punk with 
post-punk in attempt to arrive 
at shoegaze.

Unfortunately, Title Fight’s 

method is flawed. Whereas 
shoegaze requires overt preci-
sion and coordination, post-
punk demands a more loose and 
sloppy edge, and the band seems 
to think that, with enough of 
the latter, the former might be 
achieved.

Bassist Ned Russin spoke for 

the band to Alternative Press in 
early December, saying about 
the record, “We were looking 
at bands like Dinosaur Jr. and 
The Beach Boys. We were look-
ing at the moment where they 
found something that had never 
been done before and was now 
being done well. We were just 
chasing that energy.” What’s 
interesting about this state-
ment, and especially about the 
band’s approach in general, is 
that they’ve drawn direct com-

parisons to Ride, Chapterhouse 
and Joyce Manor, Mazzy Star, 
Lush and all the dreamier bands 
in between. Title Fight isn’t cre-
ating new forms so much as it is 
stitching together older, more 
disparate ones. Hyperview is an 
enjoyable and highly-digestible 
combination 
of 
dream-pop, 

punk and post-punk – but, at 
the end of the day, that’s all it 
really adds up to.

By 
being 
so 
actively 

conscientious 
about 
genre 

while making the album, Title 
Fight has indirectly rejected 
genre all together, and this 
is the paradoxical and most 
troubling part of the record. 
Evidence lies in their signing to 
a new label, ANTI-, an inclusive 
compendium of genres and 
styles. Consider for a second 
that Hyperview was financed 
and sponsored by the same 
people who finance and sponsor 
the reggae music of Michael 
Franti.

Just as well, producer Will Yip 

has spent most of his eight-year 
career at the soundboard as a 
recording engineer and mix man. 
Good production requires vision 
and an unbiased (but devoted) 
perspective. However, much of the 
record’s lack of color can be traced 
to its visionless sprawl. If the 
scapegoat here is, in fact, Yip’s pro-
duction, then Title Fight can chalk 
this record up as a sort of half-win.

Unfortunately, that’s not the 

case.

Hyperview 
begins 
with 

“Murder 
Your 
Memory,” 
a 

solid trance-rock homage to 
something Slowdive might’ve 
produced on Souvlaki; some-
thing in the vein of shoegaze, 

but still not quite self-aware 
enough to be necessarily ethe-
real. Lead vocalist Jamie Rho-
den whispers, “Murder all your 
memories,” before a wash of 
faux slide-guitar snatches the 
melody away. Before you can 
register exactly what it is you’re 
listening to, “Chlorine” begins 
and slightly alters course. It’s a 
light recapitulation of some of 
shoegaze’s more notable char-
acteristics: bass colliding with 
percussion, 
guitars 
dripping 

metallic tone after metallic tone 
from their electric wailing.

Sadly, after “Murder Your 

Mystery” and “Chlorine” the 
record loses sight of what it wants 
to be. The indecision on the back 
half of Side One spills over onto 
the front half of Side Two, and 
it isn’t until “Liar’s Love,” when 
the band re-addresses shoegaze-
like dream-pop, that they finally 
get back on the rails. Hyperview’s 
most pointed and perhaps most 
successful endeavor is “Dizzy,” a 
four-and-a-half minute escapade 
across the ocean in a flimsy life 
raft. It approaches, but doesn’t 
quite produce the sound of shoe-
gaze: the eye of the hurricane, 
the fleck of sunlight from behind 
snow clouds, the kindred warm-
ness you somehow feel with 
heartache.

These few moments of illu-

mination fail to support the rest 
of the record, which sinks in too 
many places and deflates when 
prodded with the least bit of 
emotion. A lyric in “Chlorine” 
describes it best: “Hollow / You 
can’t hold it in / Pour out / All 
your emptiness.” Substitute “try 
to” with “can’t” and you’ve got 
Hyperview to a T.

BOOK REVIEW
Daily Book Review: 
‘I Am Not a Slut’ 

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Slut. It’s a word that has fallen 

from so many tongues so many 
times that it barely registers 
anymore, whether used in casu-
al conversation or spat to insult. 
It usually refers to women who 
enjoy sex unabashedly, have 
sex with more than one other 
person or have no reservations 
about going after someone they 
want. In “I Am Not a Slut: Slut-
Shaming in the Age of the Inter-
net,” Leora Tanenbaum (author 
of “Slut!: Growing Up Female 
With a Bad Reputation”) pieces 
together a theory about why 
this four-letter word has such 
a complicated, ugly existence — 
and why it needs to be perma-
nently discontinued.

In the book, Tanenbaum 

explains how the word “slut” 
is used as a weapon against 
women ranging from preteens 
to college-aged women, and 
how it can never be reclaimed 
due to sexual double standard, 
only exacerbated by the exploi-

tation of social media culture. 
The word has gained multiple 
meanings 
as 
young 
people 

have created an entire culture 
on the Internet, only under-
stood fully by themselves. The 
hypersexualization 
of 
girls 

and women on social media is 
spilling over into real life, and 
vice versa, creating a vicious 
cycle. As girls and women are 
hypersexualized in movies and 
TV shows and advertising cam-
paigns — and these unrealistic 
portrayals are seen as desirable 
— real girls and women often 
consciously or subconsciously 
try to emulate them. Tanen-
baum says today that the word 
“slut” is not just used simply as 
an insult, but as a casual, ironic 
greeting or joke among friends, 
perhaps even worn as a badge 
of honor.

Tanenbaum strives to dif-

ferentiate 
between 
women 

who own their sexual agency 
in a way that inspires envy and 
admiration and women who use 
it to inspire ridicule and disdain 
by using the terms “good sluts” 

and “bad sluts.” “Good sluts” 
are the women people love and 
“bad sluts” are the women peo-
ple love to bash. “Good sluts” 
are sexy, “bad sluts” are sloppy. 
“Good sluts” post attractive pic-
tures to social media that tease, 
“you can look, but you can’t 
touch,” and “bad sluts” post 
photographs that beg, “look, 
please, look.” Sluttiness, Tanen-
baum observes, is as much 
about appearance and attitude 
as it is about sexual behavior or 
history.

Citing Facebook, Instagram 

and Twitter, Tanenbaum urges 
us to recognize how girls and 
women are encouraged to be 
sexual creatures, but whenever 
they take control of their sexu-
ality, they run the risk of being 
labeled a “slut” — and not in 
the good way. When a woman 
acts in a way or with an atti-
tude that feels too transparent, 
she’s “desperate.” Being sexy 
has to look effortless; if it looks 
like you put too much effort 
into it, it immediately becomes 
slutty. Her dichotomy of “good” 

and “bad” sluts, which she uses 
throughout the entire work, 
sounds clunky and unnatural, as 
no one actually thinks about it in 
those terms — but it’s an impor-
tant distinction to explore and 
she scrutinizes it well.

While 
Tanenbaum’s 

approach in “I Am Not a Slut” 
is well-argued, it sometimes 
feels too academic and unrelat-
able. By making assumptions 
about all young women and 
dealing in absolutes, she’s ironi-
cally giving them less credit for 
understanding the world they 
themselves are living in, part of 
which she is only experiencing 
second-hand. There is nothing 
revolutionary about this work. 
The most important parts are 
the interviews she recounts 
with women of all backgrounds 
who have grown up in this 
hypersexualized, cyber-centric, 

still sexually unequal society. 
Sexy or slutty is a dangerous 
game to play, they say. Even if 
you win, you lose.

Tanenbaum’s “I Am Not a 

Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age 
of the Internet” comes at a time 
when the sexual degradation 
of women is so ingrained in 
our society that we have top 40 
songs with lyrics like “I know 
you want it, but you’re a good 
girl,” and it’s not uncommon 
to see rape threats on Twitter 

or Tinder. It comes at a time 
when 
male 
leaders 
of 
our 

government are still making 
blatantly erroneous statements 
about 
women’s 
reproductive 

health issues. It comes at a time 
when college campuses all over 
the country are protesting the 
widespread 
issue 
of 
sexual 

assault 
and 
mishandlings 

of rape cases. It comes at a 
time when young women are 
finding pictures and videos of 
their assaults blowing up on 
social media and are bullied 
to the point of suicide. We 
can’t reclaim the word slut; 
its history is too ugly, and our 
present isn’t nearly receptive 
enough to be able to accept 
it as a point of pride. This is 
Tanenbaum’s final point, and 
she drives it home in a way that 
leaves the reader absolutely 
positive she’s right.

Former players give advice
for National Signing Day

By ALEJANDRO ZÚÑIGA

Daily Sports Writer

Jim Harbaugh hasn’t spent 

much time in Ann Arbor since 
he became Michigan’s football 
coach, and neither have his 
assistants.

The new staff has been busy 

visiting and calling top high 
school recruits in the hope 
that several will sign a binding 
National Letter of Intent to the 
Wolverines on Wednesday, the 
first time athletes of the cur-
rent high school senior class are 
allowed to do so.

For coaches and fans, Nation-

al Signing Day is part of a non-
stop arms race to secure future 
success on the gridiron. For the 
players, it’s the culmination 
of years of recruitment with a 
long-term commitment to a pro-
gram.

“When I finally signed, it 

was like, ‘What a huge relief,’ ” 
recalled Brennen Beyer, a four-
year letterman for Michigan at 
defensive end from 2011 to 2014. 
“It’d been a long process, been 
a really crazy process. It just 
felt so good to have set in stone 
where you’re going.”

The Wolverines’ 2015 class 

fell in size during the fall, when 
the status of former coach Brady 
Hoke became more uncertain. 
It’s a shakeup similar to what 
Beyer experienced when he 
was a recruit — he had verbally 
committed to Rich Rodriguez 
and the Wolverines in 2010, but 
that staff was replaced by Brady 
Hoke and company by the time 
he signed in 2011.

Harbaugh reached out to 

verbal commits and other pros-
pects the day he was introduced 
as Michigan’s coach, and Beyer 
hinted at what that conversa-
tion may have been like from 
the athletes’ end.

“The main question I had (to 

Hoke) was, ‘Hey, I like Michi-
gan. I still want to go here. Do 
you guys still think I deserve my 
scholarship? Do you guys want 

me?’ ” Beyer said. “I wanted to 
make sure they did.”

Though he visited several 

other Midwest schools and 
received 
increased 
interest 

from them closer to National 
Signing Day, Beyer said it would 
have taken a lot to pull him 
away from Michigan.

“I think it’s good to see what 

else is out there, to have some-
thing to compare Michigan to 
— to see if it stands up to what 
I thought it was,” Beyer said. 
“Michigan had everything I 
wanted.

“Schools, more so than get-

ting me to switch, were just 
saying, ‘Hey, are you 100 per-
cent set on it? Is there any 
desire for you to want to come 
here? If anything changes, let 
us know.’ And then highlight-
ing what they think makes 
their school better. There was 
some of that definitely toward 
signing day.”

Beyer didn’t sway from the 

Wolverines, but then there are 
stories like Roy Roundtree’s. 
The 
receiver 
was 
verbally 

committed 
to 
Purdue 
but 

made a last-minute switch to 
Michigan in 2008, prompting 
then-Boilermakers coach Joe 
Tiller to publicly call Rodriguez 
a “wizard-hat wearing, snake-
oil salesman.”

The Wolverines could use 

a few more players to follow 
Roundtree’s path and flip — and 
Harbaugh has already gotten 
some recruits to do so, includ-
ing quarterback Zach Gentry, 
who previously had been a ver-
bal commitment to Texas.

“Everyone thought on sign-

ing day I was going to sign with 
Purdue, but that wasn’t the 
case,” Roundtree said in a text 
message to the Daily. “I wasn’t 
passing up on playing at Michi-
gan.

“After signing to Michigan, 

it felt like a dream came true. I 
was heading to Ann Arbor for 
four to five years to accomplish 
something that no one thought 

I could. It was outstanding and 
joyful to see my parents watch 
me play and leave as a Michigan 
graduate.”

Roundtree, 
like 
Beyer, 

enjoyed a successful career 
with 
the 
Wolverines. 
The 

receiver made Sporting News’ 
Freshman All-Big Ten team in 
2009, caught the game-winning 
touchdown under the lights 
against Notre Dame during a 
Sugar Bowl-winning 2011 cam-
paign and ultimately finished 
his career with more than 2,300 
receiving yards.

It all might have gone dif-

ferently had Roundtree signed 
elsewhere, but ultimately, he 
said instinct led him to the 
right place. He offered similar 
advice to recruits who are still 
still deciding their collegiate 
plans.

“You’re going to have so many 

options, but at the end of the 
day, follow your heart, because 
once you sign to these universi-
ties, you’ll be attending them for 
four to five years,” Roundtree 
said. “I promise you, if you do 
that, you’ll enjoy every minute 
of it and gain major respect. It’s 
a marathon to an outstanding 
journey — good luck!”

Added Beyer: “It’s a fun 

thing, so enjoy it, and just get 
yourself ready as best you can. 
Get to know the team — come 
to Ann Arbor if you live close. 
And be confident, because you 
got yourself here, which means 
you’re good enough to be here.”

Beyer and former receiver 

Drew Dileo, who played at 
Michigan from 2010 to 2013, 
both warned signees to pre-
pare for the transition to college 
football. As Beyer explained, 
“You’re not the man anymore” 
as a freshman.

“High 
school 
football 

and college football are two 
completely different levels with 
size, speed and maturity of 
guys,” Dileo said. “Best thing to 
do is come ready to listen and 
work with your mouth shut.”

Three Things We Learned: 
Maryland and Nebraska

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Writer

After dropping its second 

consecutive 
Big 
Ten 
game 

to 
Nebraska, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

flight was cancelled, ultimately 
snowing the team in.

There’s only so much you can 

do on a snowy day in Lincoln, so 
we’re assuming the Wolverines 
(5-5 Big Ten, 13-8 overall) mulled 
over lessons from Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico while 
watching Super Bowl XLIX.

Luckily, the Daily had some 

extra time to ponder what the 
Wolverines had been taught — 
thanks to a snow day, of course 
— so here are the three things 
we learned from Michigan’s last 
two losses.

1) The Big Ten is as good as 

advertised.

Barnes Arico can’t emphasize 

this enough. With the additions 
of 
Maryland 
and 
Rutgers 

to the Big Ten this season, 
the conference is likely the 
strongest in the nation.

Last Thursday, the fifth-

ranked 
Terrapins 
showed 

Michigan how they were able 
to make it to the Final Four in 
2014.

On top of outrebounding the 

Wolverines 49-25, Maryland 
wreaked havoc on offense as 
well. Guards Laurin Mincy and 
Shatori 
Walker-Kimbrough 

dropped 24 and 20 points, 
respectively, to help lead their 
team to a field-goal percentage 
above 50 percent and a final 

score of 91-65. The undefeated 
Terrapins don’t have a weak 
spot on either side of the ball.

Though 
the 
Cornhuskers 

aren’t a new Big Ten powerhouse 
like Maryland, they were able 
to make a statement about the 
strength of the conference as 
well.

In Sunday’s contest, No. 15 

Nebraska went on a 26-5 run 
when the Wolverines ran out 
of gas in the second half. The 
Cornhuskers never looked back, 
ending the game in a decisive 
75-60 victory.

2) Lately, Michigan has had 

too much trouble scoring in 
the second half.

There 
was 
a 
startling 

similarity 
between 
the 

second halves the Wolverines 
played against Maryland and 
Nebraska.

In both contests, Michigan’s 

scoring 
ability 
dropped 

dramatically after the first half.

Against 
Maryland, 
the 

Wolverines’ field-goal percentage 
dropped from 47.1 percent to 
37.5 percent. Against Nebraska, 
it fell even more, from 52.2 
percent to 35.5 percent.

3) Cyesha Goree’s inside 

attack game will continue 
to be challenged by ranked 
opponents.

Both 
Nebraska 
and 

Maryland knew who to watch 
out 
for 
and 
double-team: 

senior forward Cyesha Goree.

With so much emphasis on 

Goree in the paint, the ball was 
often outside and in the hands 
of another Wolverine. Against 
Maryland 
and 
Nebraska, 

Goree was limited to 14 and 
six points, respectively. Goree 
is Michigan’s leading scorer 
— she was averaging 18.5 
points in Big Ten play before 
the past two games — so the 
lack of scoring proved to be 
troublesome.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

McConnell explores new frontiers after basketball

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

In November 2014, just six 

months after he won the Big 
Ten regular-season basketball 
championship 
and 
made 

the Elite Eight in the NCAA 
Tournament, Cole McConnell 
was celebrating an entirely 
different title.

No longer a member of the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team, McConnell mostly plays 
pick-up games now. But after he 
and his teammates won “Hoops 
for Hope” — a 3-on-3 basketball 
tournament, sponsored by the 
Delta Delta Delta sorority — 
there was some new hardware 
coming his way.

The prize? A signed ball from 

the Michigan basketball team.

It’s all part of life after college 

basketball for McConnell, who 
parted ways with the team after 
last season to focus more on his 
academics.

“For me, it just came down 

to the decision of ‘Do I want 
to focus on school more or 
basketball?’ ” McConnell said. 
“And I got into (the Ross School 
of Business), so then (Michigan 
coach John Beilein and I) just 
both decided it would be better 
to part ways, and I could focus 
on school and they could get a 
new recruit to replace me.”

He scored just four career 

points, and his career high 
in minutes was three, but 
basketball was as much a part 
of McConnell’s as it was any 
other athlete’s. He put in the 
same rigorous work on the same 
demanding schedule.

Since 
he 
left 
the 
team, 

McConnell has had time to 
enjoy some of the elements of 
campus life he didn’t have time 
to before. While he was already 
focusing hard on his studies 
— McConnell was a recipient 
of the University of Michigan 
Athletic Academic Achievement 

award in 2013-14 — he has also 
been able to spend some time 
rounding out his social life and 
honing 
his 
entrepreneurial 

skills.

“I’m 
loving 
(life 
after 

basketball),” he said. “I joined 
the SAE fraternity, that’s a lot of 
fun. I’ve got a lot more free time 
so I can focus on school, and I’m 
trying to start a social media 
app.”

He wouldn’t detail specifics, 

preferring to keep the project 
under wraps until it was farther 
along, 
but 
McConnell 
did 

divulge that his app would be 
called “Porter.”

McConnell 
also 
said 
he 

recently 
ran 
into 
former 

Wolverine 
basketball 

captain Zack Novak, a Ross 
graduate, who gave him some 

encouragement 
and 
wisdom 

about life in the business world.

But 
while 
he 
has 
made 

productive use of his time, 
McConnell 
admits it has 
been a strange 
transition 
period.

“It 
was 
a 

really 
great 

experience, 
I had a great 
time,” he said. 
“The 
coaches 

are 
great 

people, 
the 

players are great people.

“I think it’s for the best I’m 

not playing right now, but it’s 
definitely weird,” he said.

When 
the 
Wolverines 

were awarded their Big Ten 

Championship rings before their 
exhibition 
against 
Hillsdale, 

McConnell was on the court. 
He took in the moment, heard 

the chorus of 
applause 
and 

got his ring. 
Then, 
along 

with 
Brad 

Anlauf, 
who 

also played for 
Michigan last 
year but left 
the team in the 
offseason, he 
took his seat in 
the stands.

“I’ve played basketball since 

I was like three years old, and 
this is like the first time I’m not 
playing anymore,” McConnell 
said.

Of course, as the Tri-Delt 

3-on-3 participants can attest, 
that isn’t entirely true.

McConnell’s squad was made 

up mostly of SAE members 
and destroyed the competition 
before pulling out a four-point 
win in the championship game.

But despite his clear athletic 

advantage, McConnell said he 
didn’t dunk on anyone — less out 
of respect and more because of a 
lack of recent practice.

“I stayed mostly behind the 

3-point line,” he said. “I haven’t 
done a leg workout since I 
stopped playing basketball. I 
gotta start doing leg days.”

In addition to the signed 

ball and special-made Tri-Delt 
jerseys, McConnell’s team also 
got to donate $200 to a charity 
of its choice.

For McConnell, those types of 

prizes aren’t what he expected 
when he signed up to play at 
Michigan.

After finishing high school, 

McConnell attended the New 
Hampton School, where he 
played with, by his estimation, 
seven 
Division 
I 
prospects, 

including 
former 
Indiana 

standout and current Charlotte 
Hornets forward Noah Vonleh. 
While there, he earned offers 
from 
multiple 
Ivy 
League 

schools, though he ultimately 
decided against them.

“You can’t say no to Michigan 

over the Ivy League,” he said. 
“When you see the level of play, 
and Coach B is a great guy, you 
can’t say no.”

That affinity for Beilein and 

the program, he says, is what 
has been difficult to move on 
from.

“I miss the sub minutes of 

games — the last five minutes 
of the Nicholls State game, 
when I would have gotten in,” 
he said. “I miss the upper-body 
lifts, and I miss the whole team 
atmosphere.

“I think it’s for the best I’m 

not playing right now, but it’s 
definitely weird. All in all, I’m 
not tripping about it too hard.”

There is, though, a little bit of 

unfinished business. Asked who 
would win in a 3-point contest 
between he and sophomore 
forward Zak Irvin, McConnell 
said he wants to show that you 
don’t need to be a Division-I 
basketball 
star 
to 
beat 
a 

Division-I basketball star.

“I would win,” McConnell 

said. “Does he know I won the 
Tri-Delt 
3-on-3 
intramural 

championship? I would love 
to challenge him in a 3-point 
contest. His excuse is gonna be 
‘I gotta focus on the team, and 
I don’t have time.’ But we all 
know there’s time. There’s time 
to get a couple shots up.”

Now McConnell just needs to 

find time for a leg day.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily

Cole McConnell (right) left the Michigan men’s basketball team to explore other ventures. He still says he could beat Zak Irvin (left) in a shooting contest.

“The coaches 

are great people, 
the players are 
great people.”

VIDEO: WHAT IS HAPPINESS? 

Wednesday, February 4, 2015 // The Statement

A

nn Arbor is a city built 
upon a framework of rela-
tionships — people finding 

friends, jobs and love.

Writer Italo Calvino describes 

a particular fictional city — Ersilia 
— as full of color-coated strings, 
each representing a relationship 
between two people.

In his work, “Invisible Cities,” 

Calvino writes, “When traveling 
in the territory of Ersilia, you come 
upon the ruins of the abandoned 
cities, without the walls which do 
not last, without the bones of the 
dead which the wind rolls away: 
spiderwebs of intricate relation-
ships seeking a form.”

Though time carries away the 

physicality of cities and even of the 
inhabitants themselves, the rela-
tionships made continue to stand 
erect, to matter.

Strolling down the street this 

fall somewhere near Greenwood 
Avenue, I hear voices singing along 
to Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Heal-
ing” on a paint-chipped porch. 
While stuffing biology notes into 
my backpack, I watch a student 
and Graduate Student Instruc-
tor discussing their collaboration 
on an upcoming research project 
in New England planned for the 
summer. After a “Spy Kids” mara-
thon, I look over at my friends and 
wonder if I will be looking over at 
them on my own porch somewhere 
in Florida 60 years from now.

These relationships might begin 

on campus, but their potential to 
evolve into real-world friends, col-
leagues, and spouses is more of a 
reality than I like to acknowledge. 
Ann Arbor is a place to build these 
relationships, but also to consider 
our role and interactions with 
people outside of the University 
that are worth investing in — the 
residents with wildflowers scat-
tering their front lawns or the guy 
spooning lobster bisque into your 
cup at Le Dog.

Paris has been called the city 

of love, but college towns in the 
United States might be our twisted 
equivalent — where people find it, 
bring it with them, lose it, agonize 
over it, and download Tinder a few 
times only to end up deleting it all 
the same. Scribbling your initials 
onto a five-euro lock, wrapping it 
around the Pont des Amoreaux 
and tossing the key into the river 
below is the Paris equivalent of 
kissing under the Arch at mid-
night.

There is a significant popula-

tion of Ann Arbor that consists 
purely of residents (think: the 
people who make you roll out 
those fences between houses when 
you’re planning a party). Many of 
them are lifers, born here or hav-
ing attended college here. Their 
lives and relationships grew here 
and they chose to stay. I fantasize 
sometimes about coming back to 
Ann Arbor one day and finding 
myself and what will probably be 
a few weird little children named 
Julip, Indigo, and Theodore living 
in a rickety old house just walking 
distance from Kerrytown.

Even the most cold-hearted and 

focused among us can stumble 
upon love and connections amid 
the possibilities and opportunities 
of this city. On autopilot, rushing 

to a class or 
to work, you 
don’t see the 
city. Trapped, 
you end up for-
getting that it 
is human con-
nection 
that 

makes a city 
to begin with. 
I wish I could 
see all of the 
strings 
that 

were 
formed 

between 
us 

in this city: to 
see the ones 
color-coated 
to signify the 
lasting 
mar-

riages 
that 

began on the 
streets of Ann Arbor, or the ones 
that represent the grungy weirdos 
we eventually call best friends 
dancing mindlessly for the first 
time at the Blind Pig, or our room-
mates, and all of the roommates 
before us, talking at three in the 
morning in the worn down, quirky 
homes so many of us will “enjoy” at 
some point in our college careers.

You think about a city as you 

see it — no strings involved — but 
they exist and that realization has 

the power to banish the hopeless-
ness this overworked, underpaid 
city can exude from time to time. 
The numbers and connections are 
insurmountably numerous and 
the lives we touch altered, such 
that while the walls of the city will 
never again look how we remem-
ber them now, this place has been 
and continues to be magical, a wel-
coming open door of opportunities 
if you let it.

My Cultural Currency: Life’s just a soap opera

M

y mother and I disagree 
on 
everything. 
That’s 

how, she says, she’s able 

to get me fantastic, on-point birth-
day and Christmas presents.

“I just walk into a store and, if I 

love something, then I buy you the 
exact opposite of it. Here, I bought 
you this shirt. I absolutely hate it 
though, so I’ll walk two feet in front 
of you when we go to dinner.”

Ha.
My mother — I think — loves me. 

But our banter never reaches Rory-
Lorelai proportions of epic and our 
conversations never approach “Full 
House”-worthy sentiments.

For a longer time than I’d admit, 

I thought it might be possible that 
— and this probably sounds a lot 
harsher in writing than I mean it 
to, Mom — I was adopted. And the 
idea, or at least some tiny suspicion 
of this possibly being true, probably 
would have endured had it not been 

for the following two things:

1. I once saw a picture of her from 

when she herself was in college 
and had to double take because we 
looked “The Shining” twins level of 
terrifyingly similar.

2. Most importantly, we have an 

unabashed and shared, fervent love 
for lowbrow Indian television — 
specifically, soap operas.

Take it from me — Indian soap 

operas, with their overdramatic, 
overcooked plotlines, are better 
than Samoas, better than Tag-
alongs.

Better than Thin Mints. I’m dead 

serious, even if these soap operas 
often aren’t.

Some 
mother-daughter 
pairs 

enjoy 
scrapbooking 
mundane 

moments from their life, planting 
flowers that will eventually die in 
Michigan’s six-month winters or 
traveling together for highly inap-
propriate benders to Cancun, but 

not Mom and me.

The foundation of my relation-

ship with my mother is built on our 
mutual obsession for badly acted 
television programs with excessive 
thunder sound effects. And, like 
many of my other bad habits (i.e. 
nail-biting), it started young.

To give you a bit of background, 

soap operas in India, called “seri-
als,” take drama to a whole other 
level. 
Telenovelas 
are 
nothing 

in comparison. Serials usually 
involve a large, wealthy family that 
owns some sort of vague, powerful 
Google-like company. The men in 
the family are always signing some 
contract or fighting over some “very 
important merger that will deter-
mine the fate of their company.”

But that’s irrelevant to the actual 

plot of the serials. More often than 
not, people — like Mom and I — 
tune in for the conflict between the 
women on show. Because serials 

are so family-oriented — probably 
stemming from India’s widely-held 
belief in traditional values, but 
that’s neither here nor there — they 
rely on classic tropes of rivaling 
daughters-in-law and aggression 
between the son’s mother and his 
wife.

It’s all very riveting and, 

every year since I was four, 
my mom and I have gotten 
sucked into a show’s black 
hole. That was all before I 
went away for school, but 
I still get updates from 
my mom and, after asking 
standard Mom Questions 
— How are you? Have you 
eaten? — she’ll give me vivid 
descriptions of what I’ve

L

et’s lay out a hypothetical scenario: it’s the 2014 guberna-
torial election and the statewide results are based solely 
off the vote tallies in Washtenaw County. The results? To 

say the least, we’d find a very different state government.

A Democratic governor. A Democratic attorney general. A 

Democratic secretary of state. And, in the only totals that align 
with the actual reality, Democratic senators and representa-
tives both in the U.S and state congressional bodies.

In Ann Arbor, which makes up about a third of the county’s 

population, that distinction only grows more pronounced.

Growing up here, the jokes are pretty frequent. We’re “25 

square miles surrounded by reality” or “The People’s Republic 
of Ann Arbor.” And nowhere is that easier seen than in local 
politics, where Democrats have held all but one seat on Council 
for ten years.

Last year, following the status quo for the past few decades, 

no Republicans ran for office. There are no Republicans cur-
rently on Council, and only one independent, elected in 2011. 
Incoming mayor Chris Taylor (D), after winning a four-way 
Democratic primary, faced off against 28-year-old independent 
Bryan Kelly in the actual race, who said at the time he was run-
ning primarily to create options for voters.

I moved to Ann Arbor when I was six, in 2001, one year after 

the last Republican to hold city office, mayor Ingrid B. Shel-
ton (R), chose not to run again. For four years after that, Ann 
Arbor’s Republicans clung to a diminishing majority — two 

Council seats.

Following them, no Ann Arbor resident has been represented 

by a Republican locally.

The implications of that, however, are sometimes a little 

harder to find. On the surface, Ann Arbor isn’t that different 
from other cities; its size and its policies, many less easy to 
define as liberal or conservative like they might be at the state-
wide level, echo those of many other cities in the state.

At least in name, it’s Democratic — that’s clear. What isn’t 

always clear is what that means, both for residents and for the 
path of the city for years to come.

Checkered history
To understand Ann Arbor’s unique composition, it’s first 

important to understand that it hasn’t always been this way.

Fifteen years ago, Sheldon, a popular Republican, was mayor 

of Ann Arbor. She was the 27th Republican mayor the town has 
had, interspersed with a steady stream of independents, Demo-
crats, and, in 1851, a Whig. Ann Arbor’s newly elected mayor, 
Chris Taylor, marks only the 28th Democrat to hold that posi-
tion, meaning that, historically, the balance is actually pretty 
even.

A similar narrative holds true for City Council, which began 

to see Democratic predominance over the past few decades, 
cemented by the end of the last two Republicans on Council — 
incumbent Mike Reid, who chose not to run again in 2005, and 
fellow incumbent Republican Marcia Higgins, who switched 

parties.

Longtime residents and 

City 
Council 
members 

point to several reasons 
for the slow collapse of 
Republicans running for 
office, namely the change 
of general election dates 
from spring to fall in 1992 
and the redrawing of the 
wards in 1991.

Ann 
Arbor 
attorney 

Tom Wieder, who helped 
orchestrate 
both 
those 

policies, said the changes 
helped highlight a long-
term trend in the town’s 
demographics.

“Basically, the town just 

became — by the evolution 
of history and talent — a 
Democratic town,” Wieder 
said. “I mean, it used to be 
a Republican town many 
years ago, but that’s before 
students voted, eighteen-
year olds voted — that 
was the biggest change. 
But then there’s been a 
change in populations get-
ting older and a lot of the 
townies who used to be 
Republican conservatives, 

moderates, they were replaced by liberal baby boomers.”

City Councilmember Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2), who served 

three terms on Council as a Republican from 1994-1998, said the 
city’s Republicans viewed the fall election dates as a significant 
challenge because of an increase in voters.

“That was around the time the City Republican committee 

dissolved, because it was essentially viewed as no longer really 
likely or possible to elect Republicans in these fall elections,” 
she said. “The turnout during presidential, gubernatorial races 
… local elections get lost in those election cycles, which is unfor-
tunate.”

The ward changes, which came a year earlier and are still 

mostly represented in the current divisions today, were also 
a contributing factor, though aided heavily by the election 
change, Wieder said.

“(The wards) were drawn to try and ensure Democratic 

majority,” he said. “At that point, that was thought harder to do, 
but as things kept changing — we got the November elections 
put in in 1992 — I wouldn’t say made the ward boundaries com-
pletely irrelevant, but it diminished their importance because 
at least in the even years, with such a big turnout, you could be 
very sloppy almost in drawing the boundaries and still get five 
Democrats elected.”

Political Science Prof. Ken Kollman pointed to another phe-

nomenon linked to the moving of election dates — the increase 
in partisanship on the national level for both Democrats and 
Republicans, which in turn pushes people to become more 
polarized on the state and local levels.

“Ann Arbor is not all that unusual in being a one-party city, 

for a city of its size,” he said. “People who are in Ann Arbor and 
deciding where they’re going to vote for Republican or Demo-
cratic are primarily thinking about the reps of those parties at 
the national level. So as the Republican party, nationally, has 
trended more conservative, more to the right over the last 30, 35 
years, places like Ann Arbor are going to just naturally become 
predominantly Democratic. It goes the other way, of course. 
The state of Mississippi is predominantly Republican for much 
the same reason.”

All the same policies
When it comes to policy, Ann Arbor is, perhaps, arguably 

progressive, as evidenced by objectives like early movements 
towards conservation and a mandated living wage. But despite 
the oft-repeated jokes, many of the day-to-day activities local 
government engages in — like funding streets or deciding on 
zoning laws — are not that easily definable as such. And despite 
the clearly strong Democratic predominance, it’s hard to pin 
down exactly what changed, in regard to policy, as that domi-
nance grew. The two so-called liberal examples referenced 
above, for example, come from years where there were still 
Republicans on Council — 2003 and 2001.

Kollman said that’s not uncommon for city-level politics.
“Dealing with issues that are strictly local, it’s hard to attach 

conservative and liberal labels to them that have meaning at 
other levels of government, like national levels,” he said. “In 
other words, is spending more money on roads and streets, is 
that a Democratic or a Republican pro-kind of policy? Well, who 
knows. You’ll find plenty of Republicans who would say the gov-
ernment should spend money on roads and streets.”

Lumm agreed. She said her party affiliation rarely comes 

up in her role as a Councilmember 
— rather, she said she’s been able to 
focus is on the issues, both in discus-
sions with constituents and during 
formal sessions.

“If you look at the issues that we 

deal with at the local level, they tend 
to be more operational,” she said. “It’s 
not so much the great philosophi-
cal debates of the day, but it’s opera-
tional things like public safety, and 
making sure people are safe, and feel 
safe, maintaining the infrastructure 
of streets, water, sewer systems, city 

parks, rec facilities, picking up folk’s garbage and recyclables.”

Instead, when talking about divisions on Council, it becomes 

more about the issues, such as development, removal of home-
less camps from city land, and support for the mayor’s policies.

“You have to be paying very close attention to know the sub-

tleties of who is on which side of these issues, because the party 
labels don’t give you any indications,” Kollman said. “I mean, all 
the Democrats on the City Council, there’s two pretty power-
ful divisions, or have been, on the Council, over some impor-
tant issues for the local residents. But the party label obviously 
doesn’t communicate anything. You have to be paying attention 
closely.”

City Councilmember Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) said while she 

agreed not everything had a party label attached to it, some 
issues, like the recent issue of homeless camps, did.

“I think a lot of issues we deal with are non-partisan,” Grand 

said. “For example, things like potholes. Very non-partisan 
issue. But I also feel like there are values that come into play 
when you’re setting priorities, and some of those are inevitably 
shaped by what I would call Democratic values. So for example, 
last week I was a co-sponsor of a resolution that was address-
ing, or helping to design, our practices in terms of homeless 
encampments, and I think that focus is influenced by Demo-
cratic values.”

She said at the local level, strict partisanship loyalty some-

times has less of an impact, such as with issues like raising 
taxes, which has been contentious on Council.

“It’s a difference of opinion, and one I don’t think Democrats 

would tend to argue with at the state level,” she said. “They 
would agree that yes, we need to grow our tax base and pay for 
things like social services and other types of services that make 
us an attractive state. But at the local level, it becomes a little 
more insular in terms of thinking.”

For students, said both LSA senior Gabe Leaf, chairman of 

the College Republicans, and LSA junior Trevor Dolan, chair of 
the College Democrats, the impact is mixed.

“I think it gives us a lot more opportunities for programming 

and collaboration,” Dolan said of the Democratic nature of the 
city.

However, he added that the group rarely engages in policy at 

the city level.

“I think that there are a lot fewer partisan issues on the city 

level,” Dolan said. “Because we swing so heavily Democratic. 
And I think there are a number of social issues that can be 
addressed on the city level, but more often than not it’s fiscal 
issues, and we find issues with a lot broader appeal on the state 
and federal level.”

Leaf expressed a similar sentiment. He said the group rarely 

gets involved with city politics, namely because of the lack of 
Republican representation, but that there are policies Council 
has considered he would support.

“One of the platforms was increasing public transportation 

for the city of Ann Arbor,” Leaf said. “Whether that be buses, 
or more Amtrak, all that kind of stuff that is more of just a pol-
icy instead of a Democratic versus Republican issue. So that’s 
something I feel like we can get behind.”

Like the College Democrats, he said their ultimate interest 

lies with broader issues.

“There’s dialect, but not really a campaigning effort with 

them,” he said of city politi-
cians. “We focus on the larger 
state or national state.”

The future
Adding another layer to the 

puzzle is that, perhaps ironi-
cally, Ann Arbor is one of the 
few cities that still relies on 
partisanship for its local poli-
ticians. There are two others: 
Ionia and Ypsilanti. Every 
other city has adopted a non-
partisan system, a proposal 
that hasn’t gained much trac-
tion here.

For cities that have done 

it, there have been mixed 
responses. Bay City, Michi-
gan, faced controversy earlier 
this year over nonpartisan city 
commissioners posing for pic-
tures to be used in partisan 
promotional materials. Writ-
ing for the Royal Oak Patch 
in 2011, Frank Versagi, editor 
of the Versagi Voice, a news 
outlet focused on city politics, 
said Royal Oak elections still 
had partisan tinges.

“So-called ‘non-partisan’ elections for mayor and commis-

sioner aren’t really non-partisan, anyway,” he wrote. “Can-
didates come with a history known by most voters, but party 
affiliation has little influence on most local issues which a City 
Commission must address.”

Everyone interviewed for this piece echoed the same idea 

— that, in Ann Arbor, winning as a Republican is currently not 
really an option, a sentiment most also said they didn’t like.

Lumm, the sole independent on Council, said she thought 

nonpartisan elections would allow a broader scope of individu-
als to run, regaining some of the diversity lost from not having 
both parties represented.

“With nonpartisan elections, voters will then be more likely 

to focus on the individual candidates, their qualifications, posi-
tions and local issues, and that’s a good thing. And also, what’s 
happening now is Ann Arbor elected officials are being elected 
now in these off-peak primaries, in August, and that’s when we 
have very low turnout, and that’s certainly not the optimal situ-
ation.”

But Grand said while she would welcome more engagement, 

she also likes having her Democratic affiliation.

“I am hesitant to give that up, because for me being a Demo-

crat means something, and I’m proud to have that ‘D’ next to 
my name,” she said. “I feel very conflicted about it, honestly. I 
see the pros and the cons. But the pros of bringing more citizens 
into the system, if I felt that it was really going to increase our 
voter turnout and engagement, that would be a more compel-
ling pro than what I’m seeing right now, but I don’t know if it 
would actually do it.”

Kollman, too, said party labels are important. Nonetheless, 

he said the current situation — one-party control — might not 
be sustainable for the city.

“I think (party labels) communicate a lot to voters,” he said. 

“In the long-run, not having healthy party competition tends to 
lead to a disconnect between voters and their government, and 
also leads to cronyism and so forth. Now, is Ann Arbor headed 
in that direction? I don’t know. I hope not. It’s not always the 
case that that happens, that that leads to bad things. I think 
that the evidence from the history that I know, is that one-party 
dominance at any level is generally less desirable than healthy 
two-party competition.”

W

hen West Quad Residence Hall reopens next semes-
ter, residents will have to walk into another Ann 
Arbor city ward just to eat breakfast. Despite being 

across the street, South Quad Residence Hall and West Quad 
are in different wards — meaning they have separate represen-
tatives for Ann Arbor City Council. Situations like these arise 
across the University as all five of Ann Arbor’s wards converge 
on the Central Campus area.

In Ann Arbor, the wards are used to determine representa-

tion on city council. There are two city council members to rep-
resent each of the five wards. The Ann Arbor City Council is the 
governing body of Ann Arbor and decides a number of impor-
tant issues from taxation to local smoking policies.

The general shape of the wards is no accident. The Ann Arbor 

City Charter calls for the wards to have “the general character 
of a pieshaped [sic] segment of the City” focused “near the center 
of the city.” It has been this way since an amendment was passed 
in the election of 1967. The ward map seems, on its face, to cut up 
the student population of Ann Arbor into multiple wards. The 
Michigan Daily wanted to see if this was actually true.

To come up with the distribution of students across the city, 

we cross-referenced public voter registration records for the 
city of Ann Arbor, which include every voter’s full name and 
address, with the University’s MCommunity campus directory. 
While some students may have common names that incorrectly 
matched with voters, we only looked at voters that registered 
within the last 10 years whose full name matched exactly with 
someone holding a current student designation.

Through this analysis, we were able to create a map of the 

general distribution of students registered to vote in Ann Arbor. 
This map clearly shows that no more than 29.4 percent of the 
student population is contained within any one ward — despite a 
clear concentration of students in certain areas of the city.

While we only found approximately 7,000 registered student 

voters in Ann Arbor, for this analysis we assumed that their 
general distribution is consistent with the overall distribution 
of students across Ann Arbor. To see how this plays out with 
the overall number of students on campus (43,710) we can sub-
tract international students ineligible to vote (9,047 as of 2014, 
according to the International Center) as well as students under 
18 in September (approximately 750 according to the University 
Housing). This leaves us with about 34,000 students in a city of 
about 117,000.

Given that there were only 37,098 votes cast in the most 

recent November election in Ann Arbor, this is no insignificant 
number. Despite this, multiplying our 34,000 estimate by the 
distribution of students in each ward doesn’t result in a student 
majority in a single ward.

If there is any doubt about where students are concentrated, 

one look at our map should put that to rest. Traditional student 
housing areas including Hill Street and South Forest Avenue 
south of campus, Kerrytown north of campus, and the Geddes 
and Oxford area east of campus all show clear student popula-
tions. A quick glance also shows that each of these areas is in a 
different city ward.

It seems clear that the Ann Arbor ward map has the effect 

of splitting the student vote, but there isn’t much student vote 
to speak of. Out of the 7,000 students registered to vote in Ann 
Arbor, only 1,900 voted in the most recent Ann Arbor election. 
This raises multiple questions: if students aren’t going to show 
up at the polls, do they deserve a dedicated ward? Or is it even 
worth it for students to vote in Ann Arbor if their interests are 
clearly split between wards?

Will Leaf has a unique perspective in this debate. An Ann 

Arbor resident and University alum, Leaf was the co-chair of 
the Mixed Use Party, a political group focused on a relaxed zon-

ing code in the city and ran several students for City Council in 
the 2013 elections.

Beyond the apparent lack of engagement with local politics, 

many feel that students do not have enough of a long-term stake 
in the Ann Arbor area to warrant any type of voting accommo-
dation. Leaf disagrees. He believes that students’ unique posi-
tion as residing in Ann Arbor without strong ties to property 
ownership actually gives them a longer-term perspective on 
issues like the environment and property development.

This is not to say that when students vote, their votes are bet-

ter or worse — just different. However, Leaf feels they’re not 
as different as they seem. He spoke of campaigning with the 
Mixed Use Party and trying to appeal to student voters on issues 
of alcohol and student housing, that they often were more inter-
ested in the same issues as the rest of Ann Arbor.

He painted a picture that was far from the idea of the radical 

student liberal or uncaring college student, and suggested more 
that increased student involvement was possible, albeit unlikely, 
in the city.

High student participation recently became a reality at the 

University of California- Berkeley.

The City Council in Berkeley passed a city charter change 

that enacts a map including a student-majority ward into law. 
One of the organizers of the campaign, Berkeley alum Safeena 
Mecklai, explained that it was a lengthy process.

In some ways, their situation looked similar to what we’ve 

described here. Students were split among the city wards and 
weren’t able to have much representation in local government, 
which ultimately resulted in tensions between students and the 
city.

Mecklai recounted how they argued for a student ward large-

ly on the basis of it being beneficial for both students and the 
city as a whole. With a government more responsive to student 
needs in the campus area, those issues became more likely to 
be addressed, and the issues less spread between different con-
stituencies.

But the ward change was no magic bullet. Once students had 

a more consolidated representation, they had to register and 
vote to maintain it. Mecklai spoke of a concerted effort to reg-
ister students to vote, not just anywhere, but in Berkeley specifi-
cally.

She believes both the years-long process of creating the ward 

and the final ward itself made a substantial change in city poli-
tics. Students are now more engaged, and government leaders 
listen to them as a valuable stakeholder.

What would that look like in Ann Arbor? While it’s difficult 

to speculate on the impact on town-gown relations, there is a 
way to see what the actual map would look like. It’s a bit more 
difficult in Ann Arbor than Berkeley, particularly because of the 
split between North and Central Campuses, but we believe it’s 
an idea worth discussing. To take this beyond hypothetical, we 
created a map using a mix of census data and the data we’ve col-
lected to make a potential student ward that holds about 4,000 
of the 7,000 students.

Continuing with the same distribution we’ve been using, that 

would make students about 19,500 of 23,000 total residents in 
the ward — a definite supermajority.

Creating a student-majority ward would be no easy task. 

Most likely a City Charter amendment would be required and 
then an entirely new ward map would need to be created and 
approved by the City Council.

While no proposal is perfect, Berkeley’s example as well as 

pure appearance would suggest that a more concentrated stu-
dent ward would be worth examining further. Maybe students 
would not be able to sustain a ward, but with a chance at repre-
sentation, at least they would have more of a reason to vote.

Drawing the Vote: Ann Arbor city wards split students

T

he digital clock flashed 1:23, its red 
austerity shouting at me.

“Mom, hurry up!”

It was competition day. I spent my morn-

ing gluing on fake eyelashes and my after-
noon rushing my mother. My dance team 
was set to be backstage at 1:30, the venue a 
15-minute drive away. I did the math.

“One, two, three, four, one, two, three, 

four, one-two-three-four,” I heard her 
chant from behind the shower curtain.

“MOM.”
“Onetwothreefour, 
onetwothreefour 

onetwothreefouronetwothreefour –”

“– and five, six, seven, eight!” and my 

team stepped out on stage. I was still at 
home, shouting at my mother.

Selfish, selfish, selfish, I scream. This day 

isn’t about you, this isn’t about you! Every 
electron inside me was combusting, a nega-
tive explosion toward my mother like I 
never experienced before.

I was 12 then, the shortest girl in my 

homeroom and nominated for Little Miss 
Sunshine in West Middle’s yearbook. But I 
harbored an internal hatred like no other — 
one that I parasitically clung onto, one that 
was rooted deeper than the oak in our back-
yard. I didn’t have middle school enemies — I 
just had my mother.

My mother out-witted me in every argument. She was 

thick-skinned, and my petty insults could never shake her. 
But my greatest weapon remained three letters strung 
together.

“You OCD. You’re such an OCD!”
It was the easiest way to shut her down about anything. 

It was my go-to in every situation.

My mother is an accountant. Her profession is to order, 

to check and to count and count and count. She counted at 
the office, and then she came home and counted too. She 
counted for leisure, voluntarily, involuntarily — automati-
cally, uncontrollably.

She worked her eight-hour job into a 16-hour one — seven 

to 11 every single day. I knew her daily schedule consisted 
of an hour in the office kitchenette, obsessively washing up 
for breakfast; an hour in the bathroom scrubbing the toilet 
and sink before she could use them; then an hour napping 
in the stall to compensate for her exhaustive days – and a 
little bit of work somewhere in there.

Some may call this dedication — perseverance, perhaps. 

I just called it another attribute to her disease. She wasn’t 
consumed by her work — just consumed by an illness.

Worst of all, she had always refused to get treatment. 

She has had this disorder for as long as I can remember, yet 
she has sat paralyzed with fear of taking action. Her idle-
ness was exactly why I vowed I would never, ever turn into 
my mother. I wanted to be ambitious, proactive, a leader — 
taking initiative wasn’t a problem for me. I could not possi-
bly comprehend how she could not incite change in her life.

I remember my 16th birthday, when my mom took off 

work to spend the day in Boston with me. Before gelato 
and shopping though, I was determined to drag my mother 
to her first therapy appointment for treatment, even if she 
would kick and scream. I spent the past month scavenging 
the depths of the Internet for psychiatrists with availabili-
ties that weren’t two years in the future. I found 18 fully 

scheduled doctors who couldn’t take a new patient — but 
finally, I hit one opening.

In the waiting room, I flipped through magazines that 

detailed the success stories of other mental health patients, 
all pictured in candid laughter photos with their families. I 
anxiously waited for an hour until my mother finally came 
out — from the lobby bathroom. She didn’t need a doctor to 
confirm her condition was too severe for healthy function-
ing — this missed appointment just added to the tally of 
other missed events because of her condition.

As I grew older, I became her caretaker — her chauffeur, 

her secretary, her usher — and I begrudged her the more 
responsibility I had to take on. I was a teenager; I didn’t 
want to be so mature. I didn’t want a mom who needed to 
count on me.

***

It was my senior year of high school. I sat in my mother’s 

car in our garage after my parents went to bed. It was quar-
ter past one, and my seat reclined a degree parallel to the 
clock’s hand. I breathed in against the humming engine 
pressing back. I breathed out — as the carbon dioxide 
would soon no longer allow me to do. I smoothed out the 
pristine white dress my mother bought me for graduation. 
I unfolded my copy of the Boston Globe to pass the time, 
the one with an article on dance that my mother suggested 
I read that morning. My own mental condition shouted, 
“Do it!”

I couldn’t do it.
I felt the stress of academics, the loom of college, the 

weight of having to parent my own parent. I felt the neces-
sity to do everything and be perfect.

My mother felt the pressure of the clock, each tick push-

ing her forward in a disorder she did not understand. She 
became the clock, counting second after second, until she 
ticked, too. She felt the tug of time, tearing her away from 
being a good parent. She felt and she felt and she felt, until 
this condition numbed her daily routine, reducing each 
moment to mindless counting.

She, too, understood the need to be perfect. I guess we 

were not that different after all. Somewhere deep inside 
my spite for her, there was also the deepest love. I spent so 
much time resenting how much I had to take care of her 
that I never quite realized how much my mother actually 
took care of me as well. On top of her 16-hour occupation, 
I was her other 24-hour job — a job where she had to teach 
calculus and cheerlead at dance competitions and tell bed-
time stories and watch my adolescent soap opera.

It’s my mother’s birthday today. After over 10 years 

of battling her obsessions and compulsions and denials, 
she will finally receive regular treatment next week. She 
has finally accepted that part of her is vulnerable — and 
through this, she has encouraged me to make myself vul-
nerable through my words too.

Occasionally, I hear someone say, “Oh my gosh, I’m so 

OCD about the neatness of my room.” “Prof., can you erase 
that mark on the board there? The OCD in me is freaking 
out.”

It takes every iota of restraint within me not to slap 

these words in the face. Yet, in reflection, I used to slap 
my mother with the same ones. In graduate school in the 
States, my mother studied numbers. In college as an Eng-
lish major, I study words. It’s taken me a while, but I finally 
understand the weight of language, of words, of letters. 
They have power, and they can inflict pain.

My mother is not defined by her mental condition. There 

is so much more depth to her than I could ever see before. 
She graduated valedictorian at a university where she was 
not native to the language. She taught me trigonometry in 
eighth grade simply for the sake of knowledge. She fought 
for me to keep dancing – she is so much more than her OCD. 
She did not reproach me or resent me for venturing 750 
miles away from home to pursue my education. My goals 
have always been hers, and now hers have become mine.

For now, it’s an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but I 

believe with all my heart, that she will undeniably Over-
Come this Disease.

Alex Koi doesn’t just perform music, she embodies it. She has a quiet confidence 

offstage and the kind of commanding presence onstage that can hold the rapt atten-
tion of an audience, whether she’s singing jazz or indie electronic. She says her mind is 
bursting with melodies that seem effortlessly articulated, as if they always existed. Koi 
is a senior studying history and jazz vocal performance. She recently left the band Caves 
after a year of collaboration to pursue solo work in jazz and other improvisational music.
