INNOVATION
University goes south by southwest

School of Information
well represented at
SXSW festival in Austin
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor resident and Rackham
alum Hung Truong didn't think he had
done anything wrong when he created

Mapskrieg, an apartment finder app
that used data from both Craigslist and
Google Maps. But in May 2011, Truong
received a cease-and-desist request
from Craigslist that threatened legal
action for copyright infringement.
Mashups - digital services that use
data from multiple sources, like Tru-
ong's - are one of many hot-button
issues that members of the Univer-
sity community and tech lovers from
around the world discussed at the South

by Southwest Interactive Festival. The
conference began March 8 and closed
March 12.
Truong is set to participate ina panel
discussion Tuesday on mashups.
"(Another question is) whether you
should base a business on someone
else's data that has more control over
your company than you do," Truong
said. "If I developed on Facebook and
today they say, 'Oh yeah, it's totally fine
to do your app' and the next day they

say, 'Oh, that's not allowed anymore,'
how do you plan for that?"
Held in Austin, Texas, SXSW is a
10-day trio of festivals, each of which
focuses individually on film, music
and interactive. University commu-
nity members are most involved in the
interactive component, which includes
a trade show, technology presentations
and networking events.
Heather Newman, the School of
Information's director of marketing and

communications and the coordinator of
the University's SXSW representation
said the University's presence at the fes-
tival is bigger than any other college.
"The innovators, entrepreneurs and
heavy hitters in tech and creative indus-
tries all come here to share ideas," New-
man wrote in an e-mail interview. "It's
an ideal opportunity to show the cre-
ativity, innovation and agility that sets

For the first time in 24 years, the Big

At the biggest moments, Burke was
there for Michigan. In losses, like the
two against Indiana, Burke was the only
reason the Wolverines hung close.
In close wins, Burke supplied the
crucial stops and the deciding baskets.
Against Ohio State on Feb. 5, Burke's

at the buzzer. Last week, Burke's steal

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Rules for
CSG race
outlined
at meeting
Defend Affirmative
Action Party joins
presidential ticket
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
This Central Student Government
election season may prove to be the
most contentious in years.
About 100 people crowded into the
CSG chambers in the Michigan Union
yesterday to attend the candidates'
meeting for the end-of-March elections
to explain the rules of election to the
potential student leaders. The Defend
Affirmative Action Party announced it
will be running a presidential ticket,
bringing the total number of presiden-
tial tickets to five.
"It's a really huge turnout," Public
Policy junior Caroline Holdren, the
CSG election director said. "It looks
like everybody's excited."
Rules concerning campaign spend-
ing are new this year. Following last
year's election when a supporter of the
current CSG administration sent a mes-
sage of support through a large campus
e-mail list he didn't own - nearly cost-
ing Business senior Manish Parikh the
presidency and delaying the certifica-
tion of the results by weeks - the entire
election code was struck.
Campaign posters have already been
posted around campus, and Hold-
ren said campaign materials bought
and used before the election, such as
domain names and posters, do not to
have to be disclosed. However, if post-
ers were posted after the meeting -
which stands as the official time when
election rules go into effect - they must
be disclosed.
With last year's election in mind,
CSG Program Director Anika Awai-
Williams asked candidates follow the

" FACULTY ASSEMBLY
SACUA talks tuition and dispute
resolution with Faculty Ombuds

HEALTH OUTREACH
Events aim to educate on
medical amnesty policy

Assembly chair questions
the necessity of each
college's ombuds unit
By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily Staff Reporter
During Monday's meeting of the Uni-
versity's Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs, SACUA members dis-
cussed tuition affordability and heard
from University Faculty Ombudsman
Michael Welsh.
The conversation on cost of tuition
began with the topic of how to assess the
relative value of certain classes and edu-

cation as a whole before turning to more
tangible aspects of educational costs;
members came to the consensus that an
important aspect of lowering the cost of
attendance is determining what the Uni-
versity's financial aid packages and aid
opportunities lack.
Engineering Prof. Kimberlee Kearfott,
chair of SACUA, said the University needs
a better way to assess where its financial
aid programs fall short and then find ways
to remedy the situation.
"What are the missed opportunities for
making the University of Michigan more
affordable?" Kearfott opined.
Members also questioned Welsh on the
technicalities of the Office of Ombuds and

issues the unit currently faces. The Faculty
Ombudsman provides guidance and solu-
tions in internal conflictresolutionfog ca-
demic and University officials.
Welsh said confidentiality in dispute
resolution proceedings may be hindering
the ability of the Office of Ombuds to help
find settlements and resolution. He also
cautioned against using e-mails for confi-
dential communication - although there
are some exemptions, e-mails sent by Uni-
versity officials are generally subject to the
Freedom of Information Act, which pro-
vides for the release of public information.
He added that he prefers to talk to visitors
over the phone or in person.

Students unaware of
protection from MIP
under new law
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
As St. Patrick's Day approaches,
a group of students has organized a
series of events to promote aware-
ness of a new state law aimed at
encouraging underage people to seek
medical attention when they're in
danger of alcohol poisoning.
The policy outlined in the law,
known as medical amnesty, ensures
that people under the age of 21 will

not receive a Minor in Possession
citation if they seek medical atten-
tion for themselves or a friend who
has had too much to drink.
"The message of medical amnes-
ty has to be delivered lots of times
in lots of different ways, some for-
mal and some informal," Mary Jo
Desprez, who works on alcohol and
drug prevention for the University
Health Service, said.
The policy has been on the books
since summer 2012, but Business
senior Todd Siegal, one of the orga-
nizers for the week of events, said
not enough students are aware of the
policy.
"The goal ... is not about encourag-

Judge strikes down NYC
ban on supersized sodas ,, a

Bloomberg's drink
regulation defeated by
N.Y. Supreme Court
NEW YORK (AP) - A judge
struck down New York City's
pioneering ban on big sug-
ary drinks Monday just hours
before it was supposed to take
effect, handing a defeat to
health-minded Mayor Michael
Bloomberg and creating confu-

sion for restaurants that had
already ordered smaller cups
and changed their menus.
State Supreme Court Jus-
tice Milton Tingling said the
16-ounce limit on sodas and
other sweet drinks arbitrarily
applies to only some sugary bev-
erages and some places that sell
them.
"The loopholes in this rule
effectively defeat the stated
purpose of this rule," Tingling
wrote in a victory for the bev-

erage industry, restaurants
and other business groups
that called the rule unfair and
wrong-headed.
In addition, the judge said the
Bloomberg-appointed Board of
Health intruded on City Coun-
cil's authority when it imposed
the rule.
The city vowed to appeal the
decision, issued by New York
state's trial-level court.
"We believe the judge is
totally in error in how he inter-
preted the law, and we are con-
fident we will win on appeal,"
Bloomberg said. He added: "One
of the cases we will make is that
people are dying every day. This
is not a joke. Five thousand peo-
ple die of obesity every day in
America."
Fornow, though, the ruling
it means the ax won't fall Tues-
day on supersized sodas, sweet-
ened teas and other high-sugar
beverages in restaurants, movie
theaters, corner delis and sports
arenas.
"The court ruling provides a
sigh of relief to New Yorkers and
thousands of small businesses
in New York City that would
have been harmed by this arbi-
trary and unpopular ban," the
American Beverage Associa-
tion and other opponents said,
adding that the organization
is open to other "solutions that
will have a meaningful and last-
ing impact."
The first of its kind in the
country, the restriction has
sparked reaction from city
streets to late-night talk shows,
celebrated by some as a bold
attempt to improve people's
health and derided by others as
another "nanny state" law from
Bloomberg during his 11 years in
office.
On his watch, the city has
compelled chain restaurants
to post calorie counts, barred
artificial trans fats in restaurant
food and prodded food manu-
facturers to use less salt. The
city has successfully defended
some of those initiatives in
court.

Opposition leader Henrique Capriles speaks during a press conference in Caracas, Venezuela on Friday. Capriles called Vice
President Nicolas Maduro a bold-faced liar and accuses him of using Hugo Chavez's funeral to campaign for the presidency.

Opposition
accuses Maduro of
politicizing former
president's death
CARACAS (AP) - Thousands
of cheering, crying admirers
accompanied President Hugo
Chavez's hand-picked successor
Monday as he registered to be
a candidate to replace the dead
leader, while forcing the main
opposition candidate to delay his
entry into the race.
The massive crowd thronged
acting President Nicolas Maduro
and blocked opposition candidate
Henrique Capriles from register-
ing for the April 14 vote by the 2
p.m. deadline.
The Capriles campaign told
The Associated Press that an
aide registered for the candidate
at the election commission later
Monday afternoon.
Maduro also announced a
change in Chavez's final resting
place Monday, and the informa-
tion ministry later said that offi-
cials had not decided what will
happen to the late president's
body.
Last week, Maduro had said
the body would be embalmed

and perpetually displayed in the
country's military museum.
Thousands applauded from a
plaza outside the National Elec-
tion Commission, waving ban-
ners and holding up posters of
Chavez as Maduro registered.
Many wore the red shirts and
baseball caps of Chavez's rul-
ing Socialist Party, letting out a
loud cheer when acting President
Nicolas Maduro arrived to sign
his election papers.
Some cried as Maduro saluted
them from the building's balcony,
eulogizing Chavez once again as
Venezuela's "father redeemer"
and asking God to give him "the
wisdom to allow me to carry out
the orders he gave us."
Later, he launched into a
speech of more than two hours
in the plaza outside the building,
introducinghis longtime partner,
Attorney General Cilia Flores,
and their children and grandchil-
dren to the crowd.
"I am not Chavez, but I am his
son, and all of us together, the
people, we are Chavez," he said.
Opposition supporters
denounced the carefully stage-
managed event as an affront to
basic electoral fairness. The elec-
toral commission is meant to play
an impartial role ensuring the

vote is fair and free.
Campaigning doesn't official-
ly start until April 2, but already
the two sides are at each other's
throats.
Capriles announced his can-
didacy Sunday, while blasting
Chavez's top lieutenants for try-
ing to use the president's death
to stoke passions and tilt the elec-
tion.
"You are playing politics with
the president's body," he said,
adding that he wasn't convinced
the government had been hon-
est about when Chavez died, and
had lied to the people during his
long illness by insisting he would
get better. The government says
Chavez succumbed to cancer on
Tuesday after a nearly two-year
battle. It has offered almost no
clinical information.
Capriles previously called
Maduro a shameless liar and
referred to him condescendingly
as "boy."
Maduro appeared right after
Capriles on state TV on Sunday,
accusing "the losing, miserable
candidate" of defaming Chavez
andhis family. He called Capriles
a "fascist" who was trying to pro-
voke violence by insulting the
"crystalline, pure image of Com-
mander Chavez."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
U.S. raises $490
million from sale
of GM stock
The U.S. government has sold
another chunk of its stake in
General Motors Co.
The Treasury Department
says in its February report to
Congress that it sold $489.9 mil-
lion worth of GM common stock
last month.
The report dated Monday says
the government has recovered
about $29.8 billion of its $49.5
billion bailout of the Detroit
automaker. That means taxpay-
ers are still $19.7 billion in the
hole.
The Treasury says the price
per share will be revealed later.
GM stock sold in a range of
$26.19 to $29.36 in February. At
the midpoint of the range, $27.78,
the government would have sold
roughly 17.6 million shares.
LANGELY AIR FORCE BASE, Va.
Air Force analysts
experience PTSD
far from the war
They may never come face to
face with a Taliban insurgent,
never dodge a roadside bomb or
take fire, but they still may be
responsible for taking lives or
putting their own colleagues in
mortal danger. And now the mil-
itary has begun to grapple with
the mental and emotional strains
endured by these Air Force per-
sonnel.
While they are thousands of
miles from the gritty combat in
Afghanistan, the analysts in the
cavernous room at Langley Air
Force Base in Virginia relive the
explosions, the carnage and the
vivid after-battle assessments
of the bombings over and over
again. The repeated exposure
to death and destruction rolling
across their computer screens
is taking its own special toll on
their lives.
Now, for the first time, an Air
Force chaplain and a psycholo-
gist are walking the floor of the
operations center at Langley,
offering counseling and stress
relief to the airmen who scruti-
nize the war from afar.
INDIAN WELLS, Calif.
Modest quake
shakes wide area
of S. California
A modest but widely felt
earthquake rolled through a
wide swath of Southern Cali-
fornia late Monday morning but
there were no immediate reports
of damage.
The 9:55 a.m. quake had an
estimated magnitude of 4.7, said
Nick Scheckel, seismic analyst at
the California Institute of Tech-
nology's seismological laborato-

ry in Pasadena. He said a number
of aftershocks were occurring.
The epicenter was about a
dozen miles from the Riverside
County desert community of
Anza, about 100 miles southeast
of Los Angeles.

What you 'like' on

Clicking those friendly blue

It could out you as gay.
It might reveal how you vote.
It might even suggest that
you're an unmarried introvert
with a high IQ and a weakness

That's the conclusion of a

emy of Sciences. Researchers
reported analyzing the likes of

and presentations conducted

by 22 members of the Univer-
sity's faculty, student body
and alumni throughout the
festival. Members of the Uni-
versity community are also
participating in panels on tech-
nology issues.
At an event on Monday, the
Solar Car Team announced that
the name of their next car, Gen-
eration. They'll be racing the
vehicle at the World Solar Chal-
lenge in October.
Engineering junior Eric
Hausman, the Solar Car Team
project manager, said it is the
first time since 2001 the team
has constructed a four-wheel
car. Hesaid the four-wheel
design mandates an upright
driver, allowing the car to look
more realistic. The full design
will be unveiled in June.
"It's about finding creative
solutions to make the car as
aerodynamic as possible while
making the car (have) four
wheels and having an upright
driver," Hausman said.
Rackham student JJ Pionke
gave a presentation on digital
badging - a tool used in social
media and other platforms
to show skills or knowledge

attained by an individual - and
on her overseas internships in
Singapore and Uganda. Pionke
said digital badging is in its
nascent stages and lacks a cre-
dentialing process, but has gen-
erated techie enthusiasm.
"It's a very 'try things out'
period," Pionke said. "There's
something for everyone, and
that's the big key there. Wheth-
er you're a programmer or a
English teacher, there's some-
thing there for you - so don't
give up, and go for it."
Digital badges are not only
for Foursquare or fitness sites.
Pionke argued they could be
used on a resume to show expe-
rience in leadership or other
intangible qualities a degree
might not explain. She added
that badges could also be used
in education to award students
for participation or writing.
"This is a wayto say this par-
ticular student is really good at
X, Y and Z," Pionke said. "It's
about being creative with les-
son plans. Do you want the stu-
dents to read Shakespeare and
be bored or do you want the
students to build a digital story
platform?"

ing underage drinking, but mak-
ing sure that students know their
rights and know that if they're in
trouble and they need help," he
said.
Members of the Central Stu-
dent Government will be on the
Diag Tuesday and members of
LSA Student Government will be
on the Diag Thursday educating
students about medical amnesty,
Siegal said.
Other organizations, includ-
ing the Student Athlete Advisory
Council, the Residence Halls
Association, University Health
Services and Hillel, will be on the
Diag promoting medical amnesty
with free giveaways and music.
The whole week culminates
with CSG's second St. Patrick's
Day Tailgate on the Diag with free
food and music to promote safety
on adayknown forheavydrinking
among students. CSG has allotted
$15,000 to the event.
"It's been really a pretty great
and exciting process to have the
administration on board, to have
UHS on board, to have these stu-
dent orgs on board," Siegal said.
"People just really need to know
to make the safe decision, the safe
choice."
Desprez said medical amnesty
has been included in the online
course about alcohol consump-
tion for incoming freshmen. In the
fall, the policy was added to the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
Desprez stressed that invok-
ing medical amnesty should be a
last resort for students. Students
should not make alcohol "the
focus of the event," and students
should not consume alcohol when
they don't know what's in it, she
said.
She added that she was glad to
see student leaders taking charge
on the issue.
"This work can't be done by
one office or one administrator on
campus, it has to be done as a com-
munity so when student leaders
are willing to put their voice out
there," she said.
Siegal said in addition to events

on the Diag, Consider Magazine
will be discussing the policy of
medical amnesty in this week's
issue, WOLV-TV will be discuss-
ing it on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday and a page on the CSG web-
site will be devoted to explaining
medical amnesty.
Each partner organization is
"contributing something to the
week as well," Siegal said, adding
that RHA, for instance, will be
promotingthe policyinthe dorms,
the Interfraternity Council is
ensuring that sober monitors will
be aware of the policy and mul-
tiple organizations will be includ-
inginformationaboutthepolicyin
their newsletters. A video promot-
ing medical amnesty awareness
has also been released to coincide
with the week.
Siegal became involved in
promoting medical amnesty
awareness when, one night in
September, he came back to his
apartment complex and found an
intoxicated, non-responsive stu-
dent lying on the ground. Siegal
said he started knocking on doors
in the complex and soon a crowd
of 15 to 20 people formed.
A roommate of the passed-
out student arrived shortly after
and said his friend had already
received an MIP last year and was
still underage.
"He basically just dragged his
friend into his apartment and he
refused to take him to the hospital
and lock(ed) the door," Siegal said.
"The rest of us didn't really know
what to do because now we're in
this position where it's like none
of us reallyknowhowbad of shape
he's in."
Siegal said it was then he decid-
ed something had to be done - but
at that time, he was not aware of
the medical amnesty law.
"It really bothered me to be in
that position, to be in that predica-
ment where you don't know what
to do," he said.
The next day Siegal called LSA
senior Caroline Canning, LSA stu-
dent government president, and
she explained to him that medi-
cal amnesty was already in place.
Since then, he's been working with
multiple students from multiple
groups in "an ad hoc committee
housed under CSG" to promote
medical amnesty awareness.

"Most times people want
other people to know what their
problem is, so confidentiality
isn'tsuch abigissue,"Welshsaid.
"But it can range from wanting
people to know to wanting to
be so confidential that I can't do
anything."
Welsh also discussed broad
patterns he noticed in the cases
he was reviewing. He said about
10 percent of the people he sees
are those who realize they aren't
going to reach a promotional
tenure.
"For the most part, I can't help
them because that's a unit deci-
sion. If there's been an error in

the process, I canhelpthemwith
that," Welsh said. "But most of
the time the process has been
fine, and so I can't change the
outcome."
Welsh's term expires in
August, so Prof. Kate Barald
asked Welch about how impor-
tantinstitutionalknowledge and
discretion are for the selection
process for University ombuds.
Welsh said the most important
characteristic is to be optimistic,
yet practical.
"I think the person needs to
be an optimist and pragmatic,"
Welsh said." You've got to be
neutral. You got to look at them
from the point of being curious
about how something came out
but you can't be judgmental."
Welsh added that in certain
cases where nothing can be

done, it is important to simply
lend an ear to a visitor.
"I think it's really important
to be a good listener," he said.
"Sometimes that's all you can
do."
Dentistry Prof. Rex Holland
brought up the issue of han-
dling gender-related problems.
Welsh said he works well with
people of different backgrounds
and has a high rate of success in
cases involving a diverse range
of faculty.
Kearfott questioned the
necessity of the each college's
individual Office of Ombuds
within the University, but Welsh
countered by saying that they
are useful in some cases, even
though 80 to 85 percent of facul-
ty problems are received by him.

"Please don't have the presi-
dent's office call me that you
guys were misbehaving," Awai-
Williams said, evoking laughter
from the crowd. "Please just
have this one year where this
doesn't happen."
This is now Awai-Williams's
eighth March election as the
CSG program director. She said

her first year was the most dif-
ficult, when 50,000 campaign
e-mails were sent out.
"If it's not contentious then
it's relatively easier, but this
looks like it's going to be a con-
tentious year again," she said.
"I'm not scared; I think I'm
ready."
She added that a contentious
election can positively impact
voter turnout, which is histori-
cally low.
Law student John Lin, a

candidate for law school rep-
resentative who served on the
assembly as an undergraduate
student, said he didn't see as
much participation in the can-
didates' meeting last year.
"2009 was the first time we
had a two-party election in a
while; 2010 was pretty active,
but nothing like this," Lin said.
"We have, like, what -100 peo-
ple in here? We wouldn't come
close to this back when I was in
the assembly."

North Korea's Kim Jong Un
urges troops to max. alert

Tensions high as
Pyongyang talks
ending armistice
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- North Korea's young lead-
er urged front-line troops to
be on "maximum alert" for a
potential war as a state-run
newspaper said Pyongyang
had carried out a threat to
cancel the 1953 armistice that
ended the Korean War.
Kim Jong Un told artillery
troops stationed near dis-
puted waters that have seen
several bloody clashes in past
years that "war can break out
right now," according to a
report by North Korean state
media.
Kim's visit and the armistice
claim are part of a torrent of
angry North Korean rhetoric
that has followed last week's
U.N. sanctions over Pyong-
yang's Feb. 12 nuclear test.
Pyongyang has also vowed to
strike the United States with
nuclear weapons.
It is unclear, however, what
will come next and whether
North Korea will match its
words with action. South
Korea's Defense Ministry said
Tuesday there were no signs
that North Korea would attack
or conduct more nuclear or
missile tests anytime soon and
that Pyongyang was merely
trying to apply "psychological
pressure" on the South.
A U.N. spokesman said that
Pyongyang cannot unilaterally
dissolve the armistice, which
is still valid. Pyongyang is also
years away from acquiring the

smaller, lighter nuclear war-
heads needed to pose a cred-
ible nuclear missile threat to
the United States.
Indeed, several signs
pointed to business as usual
between the Koreas - despite
the bluster.
North Korea apparently cut
one telephone and fax hot-
line at a village straddling the
Demilitarized Zone between
the countries, but otherwise
there have been no substan-
tial operational changes,
Seoul's Unification Ministry
and Joint Chiefs of Staff said
Tuesday.
There are at least two other
working communication chan-
nels between the Koreas. As
they did Monday, the two
Koreas used a separate mili-
tary hotline Tuesday to allow
hundreds of South Koreans to
cross the border to a jointly
run factory park in the North
Korean border town of Kae-
song, according to the South's
Unification Ministry.
Much of the bellicosity is
seen as an effort to shore up
loyalty among citizens and the
military for Kim Jong Un.
Still, North Korea's anger,
and Seoul's stern rebuttals, is
boosting animosity and caus-
ing worries on an already tense
Korean Peninsula. The rivals
this week are also holding
dueling military drills.
U.S. National Security
adviser Tom Donilon told the
Asia Society in New York that
Pyongyang's claims may be
"hyperbolic," but the United
States will protect its allies.
"There should be no doubt:
We will draw upon the full

range of our capabilities to
protect against, and to respond
to, the threat posed to us and
to our allies by North Korea,"
Donilon said.
Aside from the nuclear
threats, Pyongyang has so far
only made a somewhat mys-
terious promise to strike its
enemies at a time and place of
its own choosing. This alarms
many, however, as two sud-
den attacks blamed on North
Korea killed 50 South Koreans
in 2010.
Seoul has responded to
North Korean threats with
tough talk of its own and has
placed its troops on high alert.
The North Korean gov-
ernment made no formal
announcement on its repeated
threats to scrap the 60-year-
old armistice, but the country's
main newspaper, Rodong Sin-
mun, reported that the armi-
stice was nullified Monday as
Pyongyanghad said it would.
The North has threatened
to nullify the armistice several
times before, and in 1996, after
one such vow, it sent hundreds
of armed troops into a border
village. The troops later with-
drew.
Despite the Rodong Sinmun
report, U.N. spokesman Mar-
tin Nesirky said the armistice
is still valid and still in force
because the armistice agree-
ment had been adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly and
can't be dissolved unilaterally.
Nesirky added that officials
at U.N. headquarters in New
York were unaware of any
operational changes on the
ground on the Korean Penin-
sula.

Constitutional
change draws ire
from European
institutions and U.S.
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -
Hungarian lawmakers on Mon-
day overwhelmingly approved a
longamendmenttothe constitu-
tion which critics say threatens
certain democratic checks and
balances.
After smaller protests during
the day, several thousand people
gathered in the evening near the
offices of President Janos Ader,
asking him to veto the amend-
ment.
The bill enshrines in the Fun-
damental Law, as the new con-
stitution is called, a number of
policies that were previously
been struck down as unconsti-
tutional by the country's high-
est court.
The amendment was passed
by a vote of 265 to 11, with 33
abstentions. Prime Minister
Viktor Orban's conservative
Fidesz party and its small ally,
the Christian Democrats, plus
three independent deputies
voted in favor.
The vote drew swift reaction
from European institutions,
which along with the United
States and many Hungarian
legal experts and civic groups,
say it puts too niuch unchecked
power in government hands.
"These amendments raise
concerns with respect to the
principle of the rule of law, EU
law, and Council of Europe stan-
dards," said a statement issued
by Jose Manuel Barroso, presi-
dent of the EU Commission, the
bloc's executive, and Thorbjorn
Jagland, secretary general of
the Council of Europe, a human
rights watchdog.
They urged Hungary to
engage with them "in order to

address any concerns raised
as to the compatibility of these
amendments with European
principles and EU law."
The evening rally was held
near Sandor Palace even though
President Ader was in Germany
on an official visit and police
closed off the area, forcing pro-
testers to make long detours to
reach their meeting point.
People in the crowd shouted,
"We want democracy" and one
sign held aloft read: "Should we
be citizens or subjects?" Later,
they marched across the Chain
Bridge over the Danube River
and headed toward parliament.
Among the government poli-
cies struck down by the Con-
stitutional Court over the past
months and now added to the
Fundamental Law are the possi-
bility for local authorities to fine
or jail homeless people living in
public areas, a ban on political
campaign ads on commercial
radio and TV, and a contract
obliging university students
who accept state scholarships to
work in Hungary for years after
graduation.
The amendment also pre-
vents the president or the
court from reviewing changes
to the Fundamental Law other
than for procedural errors and
practically wipes out 20 years
of jurisprudence by banning
the court to refer to rulings or
reasoning given while the pre-
vious constitution - originally
a Stalin-era document nearly
fully re-written in 1989 as
communism ended in Hungary
- was in force.
Speaking in the legislature
ahead of Monday's vote, Prime
Minister Orban did not direct-
ly address the amendment but,
commenting on another mat-
ter, made it clear that the gov-
ernment would keep searching
for ways to circumvent court
decisions that go against its
will.

Scoring the scorecard
White House tool is a good step, but incomplete and misleading
On Feb. 13 the Obama administration unveiled the College
Scorecard, an online program aimed at assisting prospec-
tive college students by reviewing the financial aspects of a
college education. This online tool compares net prices, graduation
rates, loan default rates and median borrowing. Though the College
Scorecard is a step in the right direction in that it serves to make
colleges more transparent and accountable by publicizing student
debt load and financial difficulties post-graduation, it fails to con-
sider in-state and out-of-state tuition differences, as well as long-
term student success.

Femnaysayers no more

The Scorecard calculates the net price of a
college education as what an undergraduate
student pays for tuition after grants and schol-
arships have been subtracted from the cost of
attendance. Also included in the online tool is
the graduation rate of the university, which is
the percentage of first-time, full-time students
who graduate within six years - leaving trans-
fer students and adults completely out of the
picture. Additionally, there's a tab for employ-
ment that is supposed to give information on
average earnings post-graduation, though this
is a work in progress.
The College Scorecard in its entirety is a
centralized place where students and parents
can compare colleges financially, establishing
a platform for the ultimate college search. Uni-
versities can be sorted by interest, major, loca-
tion orscholarship. Costs and default rates can
be compared to the national average, as well
as across colleges. It is ultimately building a
"shopping sheet" that also provides a link to
each college's individual price calculator for a
more in-depth estimate.
The tool highlights financial data but fails
to present it in a way that allows for a healthy
comparison. The average net price of atten-.

dance and median borrowing is misleading
- there's simply not enough statistical infor-
mation, such as standard deviation or the cost
of living, that would form a more exhaustive
report. The median and average values don't
account for the high and low numbers that
may have accumulated at any end of a range
and vary college to college. Furthermore, the
data used to put this online tool together is a
few years old, and it's still uncertain how often
this information will be updated.
While the financial information is a prior-
ity for many prospective college students, it
puts too much emphasis on finances and not
enough emphasis toward other crucial aspects
of a university education. Important deter-
minants like learning outcomes, student sat-
isfaction and quality of education are left out
of the equation. The numbers may dismiss a
student from attending a college that may be
an excellent fit. Moreover, it incentivizes stu-
dents to regard attending college only as an
investment that will increase future income
and deter them from focusing on intellectual
development. This effort by the Department
of Education is praiseworthy, but can be made
even better.

Picture a feminist. Sounds easy,
but it shouldn't be.
Some of them have hairy legs.
Some of them
shave. Some of
them are female.
Some of them
are male. Some
of them march
around cam-
pus in a parade
chanting, "Take KATIE
back the night." STEEN
Some of them
mention the
word "feminist"
only when shrouded in the online
company of Tumblr users. Some of
them don't even know how to define
the word "feminism." Some of them
don't even know they're a feminist
at all.
Feminism is tricky. Its definition
is elusive and varies for everyone.
But tell people you're a feminist,
and more often than not they'll start
to get nervous or defensive. A lot
of people avoid feminism, without
even knowing what it is.
The what-is-a-feminist debate was
sparked anew by Marissa Mayer, the
chief atYahoo!. Recently she has gar-
nered a lot of attention from her ban
on working from home. This is after,
of course, she built her own private
nursery in her office after having a
baby and taking a two-week mater-
nity leave. But before she sent a mes-
sage that essentially said maternity
leaves are for chumps - just bring
your nursery to work - she offered
this message, which actually came
from her mouth:
"I don't, I think, have sort of the
militant drive and the sort of, the
chip on the shoulder that sometimes
comes with (feminism). And I think
it's too bad, but I do think feminism
has become, in many ways, a more
negative word."
Here's the deal: "Feminism"
hasn't become a negative word; it
has been made that way by the peo-
ple who, to put it simply, don't want

equality for women. Taking away
the credibility and significance of
the label has actively worked to
take away the credibility and sig-
nificance of feminism itself for gen-
erations. And the reason feminism
continues tobe a "negative" word is
because people like Mayer - people
with power and capital - are rein-
forcingits bad reputation.
If she thinks it's too bad that
feminism has such a piss-status,
why doesn't she try to change that
instead of just joining the ranks of
femi-naysayers who have been ridi-
culing the cause for years in order
to maintain their own privilege and
derail the fight for equal rights?
The thing about feminism is that
it doesn't use privilege as an excuse.
"Well, if I made it to CEO status,
and I can take a two-week mater-
nity leave, and I have enough money
to build a nursery in my office, then
I don't see what the problem is for
you. See - women have the abil-
ity and rights to do this!" Nope, not
everyone can say the same.
Yes, many of the "battles have
been won" for women like Mayer.
But that doesn't mean everyone
is on the same playing field as she
is. Women around the world have
nowhere near the amount of free-
dom and rights that people like
Mayer have. This isn't a "chip on
the shoulder" after years of hearing
bullshit jokes like "you throw like a
girl" or "go make me a sandwich."
It's rape, domestic abuse, under-
payment, harassment and voter
suppression. It's all the fear, shame
and humiliation that can come with
being born a female, as well as all
of the failure to be taken seriously
with the label of"feminist."
Some people might need femi-
nism more than others, and it's a
shame that such a powerful woman
like Mayer doesn't realize this.
People who question the label of
"feminist" tend to argue that femi-
nism is losing its place in our society,
that we have made enough advance-

ments as is. To me, this is the same
mentality that once allowed women
to attend the University but refused
to let them enter through the front
door of the Union. Instead, women
had to use the back door of the
building. Did it make a huge dif-
ference that women couldn't enter
through the front door? Probably
not. But it said something about
who is granting what freedom to
whom, and how much freedom is
being granted. It's minor stipula-
tions like this that say, "Well, jeez,
we've given you these rights - don't
push it. Just be thankful for what
you've got."
People will avoid
feminism without
even knowing
what it is.
Feminists don't want to take away
men's rights, just like women who
wanted to enter through the front
door of the Union didn't want to
prevent men from going through the
damn door. They weren't concerned
about limiting men's access - they
wanted equal access themselves.
And still today in our society, not
everyone has equal access. When
potential role models like Mayer
send a message that feminism is no
longer necessary, that it's become
just a "chip on the shoulder," they
are falling into a complacency
marked by self-privilege while also
actively working to not increase the
rights and freedom of women who
do not benefit from the same access
that Mayer has.
Being a feminist means solidar-
ity with all women, not just the ones
who can afford private nurseries.

Cultivating our sustainability


Last Friday, I walked through a green-
house. It was full of students laughing and
talking as they buried seeds into rich soil and
watered tiny green seedlings. I heard stu-
dents introducing themselves to fellow class-
mates they would have otherwise never met
as they learned what tiny pepper plants look
like and how many different kinds of lettuce
there are.
Until very recently, this scene would have
only been found.at Yale University, at Michi-
gan State University, at Duke University, but
not at the University of Michigan. Here at
Michigan, there was no large university-wide
option for students to come together over
growing food, to bond over pepper plants, or
to learn what produce looks like before it's
bound up under the lights at the supermarket
or on the buffet line in their dining hall. If
students learned about food at all - food, the
stuff we enjoy and talk over and depend on for
our survival every day, the topic that creates
a common thread between all peoples, com-
munities and our environment - it was in a
theoretical sense, such as in a classroom or
outside of school entirely in a student group.
Those student groups, I hasten to add, such as
Cultivating Community, Outdoor Adventures
Garden Project and many others are doing
outstanding and inspiring work.
But this is changing. Until last year, we
were one of very few of our peer schools with-
out a campus farm. That scene I described
took place in the greenhouse that is here on
University property on a workday for the new
campus farm. This is a new era, and there is
real potential for the University to become
a victor in the field of sustainable food. So
many things are pushing us in that direction,
such as the clear goals for food sustainability
set out in the University's Integrated Assess-
ment, the new Food Systems faculty cluster
hire in progress, the nearly-a-dozen gradu-
ate and undergraduate student groups work-

ing on issues related to food and agriculture
and the new courses with food components
springing up every semester.
Created lastyear, the UM Sustainable Food
Program seeks to harness and organize that
energy and the campus farm to create a place
where theory and talk can find physical out-
let in the hands-on and community-building
work of actually growing food. These pro-
grams have come far in the past year. Our
goals of creating a community around food,
of providing a new kind of experiential edu-
cation for students and of providing fresh,
healthy, local produce are already being real-
ized in many ways.
But momentum is lost when it's not sup-
ported. The ball stops rolling when it has no
clear path. And programs falter when there is
no clear leadership. Until now, this initiative
has been student-led, with advice and support
from faculty and staff. In order for the UM
Sustainable Food Program and campus farm
to endure, to bring real food, true sustainabil-
ity, fresh community and creative education
to the University, we need to institutionalize
this program. The University can prove itself
in the field of sustainability, but it needs to
do so by putting its money where its mouth is
and devoting a full-time staff member to the
management of this program and farm. Let's
meet the challenge of our peer schools. Let's
go beyond talk. Let's bringsustainable food to
campus and create a future where our dining
halls boast sourcing from our own campus
farm, where students make new friends over
harvesting their own lunch, and where stu-
dents, faculty, staff and members of the com-
munity can come together over one thing we
all love to talk about: food.
The time is now. If we wait to act, the
momentum dies. Let's do what it takes to
make this future a reality.

An obstructive move

can't imagine standing up at
a podium for 13 hours, par-
ticularly on a national stage
like the Senate
floor. In such
cases, one might
think of "Mr.
Smith Goes to
Washington."
I'm curious to
know what was
going through
Sen. Rand Paul's PAUL
(R-Ky.) mind as SHERMAN
he conducted
an actual talk-
ing filibuster for
not one, but 13 hours, during which
he questioned whether or not the
president has the power to kill a U.S.
citizen on U.S. soil. It wasn't enough
to break Sen. Strom Thurmond's
record of more than 24 hours, but it
was impressive nonetheless.
It was refreshing to hear his rea-
soning behind the filibuster. In an
op-ed in The Washington Post ear-
lier this week, he said he "wanted
to sound an alarm bell from coast to
coast. I wanted everybody to know
that our Constitution is precious and
that no American should be killed by
a drone without first being charged
with a crime." It appears, for once,
that a senator was trying to push
an issue that he really cares about.
Today, the filibuster has rarely been
used in this manner, as it has been
used solely as a tool for obstruct-
ing the political process. The Sen-
ate must reform the filibuster, since
it blocks the passage of meaningful
legislation ina timely manner.
Before World War I, the use of the
filibuster was quite rare. Today, fili-
busters have been used much more
regularly. Until 1971, the number of

cloture motions - the vote to end a
filibuster - that were filed remained
below 10. However, between 1971
and 1972, that number increased to
24. From 2009 to 2010, 137 cloture
motions were filed. Throughout this
period, both Democrats and Repub-
licans have invoked the filibuster,
increasing its use during both the
Bush and Obama administrations.
Since the filibuster can only be
ended by a supermajority vote, the
procedure allows minorities to stall
legislation without even having to
speak. This has made it easier for
the lowest ranking members of the
Senate to hold up a bill even if it has
majority support. As Sen. Jeff Merk-
ley (D-Ore.) has said in a resolution,
the silent filibuster has become "an
instrument of partisan politics."
In recent years, the filibuster
has been used solely as a roadblock
instead of as a tool to raise important
questions about legislation or nomi-
nations.The destructive nature ofthe
filibuster has been furthered mainly
by the creation of the dual-track sys-
tem. This system allows the majority
leader, with unanimous consent or
approval of the minority leader, to set
aside the filibustered legislation and
move on to another issug. There are
no consequences for senators, so they
can continue to use it as an obstacle
without any concerns.
In terms of solutions, Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid has
been working to pass filibuster
reform with Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell. Senators Tom Udall
(D-N.M.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.)
and Tom Harkin (I-Iowa) have also
been working on another plan. How-
ever, neither of these proposals will
be adequate.
The Senate, first of all, needs to

provide the parties with incentives to
not filibuster. To do this, they should
replace the silent filibuster with the
talking filibuster and eliminate the
dual-track system. Invoking the fili-
buster should have consequences to
the senator initiatingthe process.
Filibusters are
a destructive
roadblock.
In addition, there are two other
ideas that have received less atten-
tion but could each have a dramatic
positive impact. A cap on the num-
ber of filibusters that can be used by
each party during a session of Con-
gress would provide discipline to
the process, ensuring that only key
issues are blocked. Eliminating the
supermajority vote to end a filibus-
ter would also be productive solu-
tion. Democratic Sen. Al Franken,
for example, has suggested that the
minority should be forced to get 40
votes to continue a filibuster.
Until the Senate passes a solution,
the filibuster will continue to act as
a stopgap for vital legislation. What
once was intended to give a voice to
minorities has become a major tool
for policy gridlock. According to
Ezra Klein of The Washington Post,
Paul's filibuster was an example of a
"rare and unusual effort to ... draw
attention to a senator's very real
concerns on a very serious issue."
Hopefully, that can become more of
a reality in the future.

Bowie returns from long
hiatus with 'Next Day'

FM COLUMN
Films are not
media-savvy
enough

Even 10 years later,
the English rocker
still captivates
By JOHN LYNCH
Senior Arts Editor
Since the release of his self-
titled debut in 1967, David Bowie
has (for the most part) consis-
tently pro-
duced intricate A-
and innova-
tive works of The Next
art with each Day
album. Like
any other work David Bowie
of art, a Bowie Coumbia
LP must be
approached
with a critical eye (detecting the
often symbolic nature of his cover
artwork) and an interpretive ear
- absorbing the record's sonic lay-
out and then gradually discerning
the characters and lyrical worlds
that Bowie constructs.
The Next Day, Bowie's 24th
studio album, adds yet another
salient opus to the artist's catalog.
The cover art - a reinterpretation
(rather, dismantling) of the art-
work for his critically acclaimed
1977 album, Heroes - signifies
Bowie's reinvigorated spirit and
disregard for repetition in his
work after a decade-long hiatus.
Rarely on this record does Bowie
sound anywhere near his 66 years
of age, and the album's musical
landscape is equally vigorous
throughout.
On the title track, Bowie imme-
diately sheds 10 years' worth
of dust with a roaring swirl of
guitars and an emphatic cho-

COLUMBIA

Technically, the movie "Labyrinth" should have been called "Maze."

rus - reintroducing himself to
the world of rock 'n' roll by pro-
claiming, "Here I am, not quite
dying." Powerful and ostensibly
self-referential, "The Next Day"
is an opener that seems to reflect
on his fans' unquenchable thirst
for new music via a narrative of
a man being hanged by his fellow
villagers.
The billowy "I'd Rather Be
High" finds Bowie channeling his
inner escapist, crafting a straight-
forward stoner's chorus that
would make Wiz Khalifa envious
if it weren't for its dark undertone.
Far from a love song, "Valentine's
Day" imparts the chilling tale of a
school shooter named Valentine
against contrastingly pleasant
instrumentation that recalls the
English rocker's heyday.

Though The Next Day rarely
misses, its centerpiece track, "If
You Can See Me," certainly does
- disrupting the album's flow and
concluding its compelling first
halfon a sour note. "IfYou Can See
Me" is a bewildering, structure-
less song that wanders frantically
about and should've either been
left as a bonus track or dropped on
the cutting-room floor.
"Where Are We Now?" -
the album's lead single - floats
steadily through various destina-
tions of Berlin on top of strings
and a melancholy guitar. Disori-
ented and despondent, Bowie
croons his way around Germa-
ny's capital city and hazily rumi-
nates on love and life's journeys.
Though it's an oddity among the
album's many assertive, guitar-

driven tracks, "Where Are We
Now?" is a beautiful ballad and
arguably The Next Day's finest
song.
Since suffering from a heart
attack in 2004, David Bowie and
his mythical persona have been
out of the public eye (at least in the
world of music) - his departure
representing a shockingly mortal
encroachment on the immortal
existence of Ziggy Stardust. Con-
trary to the 2011 Flaming Lips
and Neon Indian song, "Is David
Bowie Dying?" this legendary
artist is still breathing and creat-
ing classics. If Bowie were to die
tomorrow (God forbid!), The Next
Day would undeniably serve as a
perfect culmination of his many
talents and his captivating, sto-
ried career.

,m that person at the the-
ater: Slouched to the right,
encroaching on your arm-
rest territory. Maybe I've drooled
on your shoulder. Twice. Then,
back in the
parking lot,
you're wav-
ing your
hands and
mimicking
the sounds
of explosions
through BRIANNE
puckered lips JOHNSON
and spit as I
huff and puff
through the cold, pretending
that, yeah, I know that scene! Oh,
that one. That was a good scene!
Actually, I was asleep. Sorry.
Maybe I've inherited an
undiscovered, media-unfriendly
genetic disorder from which my
mother has been accused of suf-
fering for years. But keep in mind
that it's my father who's doing
the accusing here, resentful and
worn weary after two decades of
dates dragged to the latest Tom
Cruise premiere as mid-movie
smooches drift into snores. Mom,
is this really my future?
Or perhaps my $8 nap (half
price if I squeeze into the local
MJR before 4 p.m.!) is a deeply
rooted psychological issue.
Would Freud propose that it's a
regression to childhood habits;
have I been channeling dim mid-
dle-school classrooms and cool
desktops as "The Temptations"
drones from the projector speak-
ers and that Julie girl kicks an
origami-ed note across the floor?
"Jeez, just pick better mov-
ies," you complain. Excuse me,
my taste in film is paralleled
only by the Oscar-winning elite
- just referto my last column in
which I practically piss praise
over a movie that earned a solid
21-percent rating from Rotten-
Tomatoes. C'mon, it received
double digits; that must mean
something! (I should pick better
movies).
But, if so, what's my excuse for
snoozing through both halves of
Harry Potter's final adventure?
Watching zero minutes of "Zero
Dark Thirty"? Retreating into
sleep from the booms and boobs
of the third "Transformers"?
The ways in which audiences
engage with a media text are as
diverse as the audiences them-
selves: actively, passively and
interactively; creasing corners
and highlighting text; clicking,
typing, watching and surfing. But
unlike television, literature and
new media, film isn't flexible.
It is what it is, and you are
what you are: a viewer. And me
- well, I'm technically a viewer
until I fall asleep.
A movie requires your full
attention; shush the back row,
blacken the room and just watch.

Watch at a theater, watch in your
roommate's beanbag chair, watch
in the passenger seat or between
blankets, but watch. Just watch.
Some may argue that most
entertainment media offer aspas-
sive experience; after all, televi-
sion is responsible for crops of
couch potatoes, the epitome of
a lazy Saturday (or every day)
night. But, asaviewers, tweet-
ers and readers, we're allowed a
degree of circumscribed agency
in how we use and engage with
media; but it's a spectrum on
which film is, dare I say it, at the
bottom.
The Internet lures users into
communities, offers forums for
multilogue, encourages creation
and continually weaves webs of
associations and hypertext that
we directly and actively navigate.
Books and magazines demand
that we turn their pages, marking
recipes or jotting notes. Even the
television industry has revived
the text-user relationship,
drawing viewers to shows, and
fandoms together, through live
Twitter hashtags. So, film, where
you at? Why hasn't - or can't
- film adapt to our fast-paced,
multi-tasking, social network-
needy culture?
Catching
some z's at the
movies.
Film, you are my high-
maintenance significant other
in this way. You provide me
with no commercial breaks, no
fully efficient come-back-later
format without missing plot
points or disrupting the escapist
experience. I have no say in our
relationship: I passively sacrifice
hours and attention as you pres-
ent a distinct, carefully molded
and unmalleable product.
Maybe this makes you more
pure, closer to your artsy ances-
tors, untaintedby the demands
of short attention spans and wifi
connections. I can appreciate
that. I just don't always have the
time (or the energy) to keep up. I
hope you understand.
So, my theory? Film is one
of the few art forms and media
industries that has yet to conform
to, or adapt to, the very strategies
- from real-time fan interaction
to the Plato's Closet commercials
that serve as opportunities to
race to the nearest fridge - that
keep me awake.
But, then again, maybe it's just
in my genes. Thanks, Mom!

to feed on our

on the ageless story of the wicked
green witch and the elusive, great
Oz. The twist is that we don't yet

James Franco ("Spring Break-

a small-time Kansas conman pos-

He's swept up by a rogue tornado
as he flees two of his woman-

balloon, which plops him down
into a fantastical land, where he
encounters (and quickly seduces)
innocent witch Theodora (Mila

the great wizard of Oz lore, sent to
deliver the land from the clutches
of a mysterious, evil witch. But the
selfish hero decides not to fill her
in on his unimpressive true self.
Theodora leads her new love to
the gleaming Emerald City, where
her fellow witch sister Evanora
(played with wicked aplomb by
Rachel Weisz, "The Bourne Lega-

to the dark forest in order to kill
the evil witch before he can claim
his throne and the enticing riches
that come with it. There he finds

BARTELSTEIN
From Page 8
to Beilein, threw one final wrench into Bartelstein's
recruitment.
Tilton, whom Bartelstein called a "huge coach
Beilein fan," ran the same two-guard offense that
Michigan featured, especially earlier in Beilein's ten-
ure. Bartelstein wasn't a Wolverine fan but had sev-
eral friends from high school at Michigan.
"Michigan seriously came in so late that it was
never in the realm," Sheri said. "That was never part
of the plan."
The Wolverines had also just wrapped up a sea-
son that saw the program's first NCAA Tournament
appearance in 11 years. But something else about
Michigan caught Bartelstein's eye; the Wolverines'
two captains, starting point guard C.J. Lee and David
Merritt, another guard that saw significant playtime,
were both walk-ons.
With Merritt and Lee graduating, Beilein was
intrigued by Tilton's email.
Bartelstein had been to Ann Arbor before to visit
friends - "never thinking he'd play basketball there,"
as Sheri put it - but on the weekend of April 26, 2009,
Bartelstein and Mark spent the day with Beilein and
assistant coach Jeff Meyer touring the campus and
basketball facilities.
With time to spare before their flight home, father
and son took a seat along the first-base line at Ray
Fisher Stadium to catch the end of an Indiana-Mich-
igan baseball game.
"He turned to me and said, 'Dad, I'm going to
Michigan,' "Mark recalled, laughing.
He tried to slow his son down - even making Bar-
telstein sleep on his decision before committing -
but the decision was sealed.
"I was just like, 'I don't think there's anywhere
else that I would go,' " Bartelstein said. "After being
shown around, it was just obvious that this was a
dream come true.
"It's Michigan. How do you turn down Michigan?"
The next day, Bartelstein called Beilein to formally
commit.
By that time, Northwestern had also entered the
picture, tendering Bartelstein the same preferred
walk-on offer as Michigan. Evanston is just a half
hour away from Highland Park, and the Wildcats, a
team often predicated on mid-major caliber recruits,
may have given Bartelstein a better opportunity to
see the floor. The Wolverines had just made the tour-
nament in Beilein's second year, and though the team
wasn't as talent-laden as it is now, the headman was
honest with the Bartelsteins.
"They told me right away that nothing was going
to be guaranteed," Bartelstein said. "'You're going to
have to work really hard for everything, you're going
to have to play better than any scholarship player,
and if you and a scholarship player are even, you're
not going to play. You've got to be above him, but you
can do it. Look at C.J. and Dave; I'm not going to say
you can't do anything, but it's goingto be really, really
hard."'
The first time Bartelstein saw his jersey,
No. 20, illuminated under the lights of his
old locker in Crisler Arena, he snapped a picture and

sent it to family members.
"He's always been a really, really good player,
but the day that he sent the photo, it was - there's
no question that you take a deep breath and go, 'Oh
my goodness, he's actually playing for Michigan,' "
Mark said. "It's an overwhelming thing."
Sheri cried.
"I was happy that I guess," her voice trails off,
seeped in emotion, "that he made it, that he was liv-
ing his dream."
Against Northern Michigan in Michigan's first
game of the 2009-10 season, Bartelstein - playing
the final four minutes of the Wolverines' 97-50 win
- penetrated a crease in the paint. When help-side
defense came, he dished what he still contends was
a "really good pass" to former forward Eric Puls
for what should've been his first career assist. But
Puls bobbled it out of
bounds, and it wasn't
until his high-school
coach called that Bar-
telstein found out he
was credited with a
turnover - the only
non-foul stat he record-
ed all season.
"If you go back and
look at the tape, you
would realize that it,
was really just a -" he
paused to laugh, not
wanting to throw a"
teammate under the,
bus, " a miscommunica-
tion."
His playing time
has been few and far
between since. There
was an ankle surgery.
his freshman year and
another this season
- he injured it during
a two-minute outing
in the opener against
Slippery Rock - both
on the right ankle,
and a concussion that
sidelined him for a sig-
nificant stretch of his Senior Josh Bartelstein has th
sophomore season.
He missed his first six shots before finally drain-
ing a 3-pointer in an 80-57 loss to Purdue in his
sophomore year. His only others points, another
3-pointer, came in a blowout loss to Ohio State in last
season's Big Ten Tournament. The prolific shooter
who tore up the prep league has shot just 13.3 per-
cent from the field in his career.
Still, former guard Stu Douglass insists that when
healthy, Bartelstein is a different player in practice.
"A lot of times in practice, he would kill us - just
not miss a thing," Douglass said in a phone interview.
Bartelstein, who's admittedly not the most out-
spoken person, has become the team's unofficial
spokesperson.
Bartelstein's first blog was titled "The
Wolverines Abroad: Player's Perspective."
Written Aug 22, 2010, it was a part of a seven-

part series of blogs - each by a different player
- chronicling the team's offseason trip to Europe.
When the concept became a hit back home with
the fans, a team official approached the team ask-
ing if any players would be interested in writing a
season-long weekly blog; Bartelstein was the only
volunteer, and the "Bartelstein Blog" was born.
He admitted he didn't think it would ever catch
on, but since he wrote the first one on Oct. 15, he's
written at least one in nearly every single week of
the past three seasons.
Writing about a variety of topics, Bartelstein gives
fans unique behind-the-scenes access on a variety of
topics, using a dialect that mom says is "exactly how
he talks."
Bartelstein receives more than a hundred emails
each week from fans responding to entries and ask-
ing questions he'll answer
in future blogs, while
other fans, even students,
approach him on campus
and at games about it.
While he says the fan
interaction is his favorite
part, he plans to aggre-
gate the 77 blogs he's writ-
ten - with at least a few
more coming in the next
month - and turn it into
a book, highlighting his
time at Michigan.
"When I look back at
what I wrote my sopho-
more year, I can see how
far we've come," he said.
"It's really rewarding for
me because it's kind of
a journal of my years at
Michigan.
"Between the blog and
being a captain, I prob-
ably am more well known
(than most walk-ons), but
I enjoy it. I love interact-
ing with people."
FILE PHOTO/Daily iving with Bar-
e ear of the locker room. telstein has its
perks, Douglass - Bartel-
stein's roommate for two years - says.
Douglass and Novak lived in an off-campus apart-
ment with Bartelstein duringtheir junior and senior
seasons, and Morgan, Hardaway and Jon Horford
have moved in since.
Bartelstein has a wealth of information regard-
ing the business side of the NBA that he's picked up
from his dad, along with a multitude of stories his
dad has gathered through the years (Indiana Pacer
forward Danny Granger, one of Mark's former cli-
ents, became former forward Colton Christian's
favorite player after Bartelstein told teammates
about Granger's plans to build a Batman-style Bat-
cave beneath his New Mexico home).
While NCAA regulations prohibit agents from
interacting with student-athletes, Mark's situation
is a unique exception - though he leaves the busi-
ness side of his profession out ofhis son's apartment.
"We just don't go there with that," Mark said,

adding that he treats Bartelstein's roommates no
different than the roommates of his daughter, a Uni-
versity freshman.
When Bartelstein moved in with Novak and Dou-
glass, Douglass realized he could take advantage
of Bartelstein's knack for taking around-the-house
responsibilities, letting trash and dishes pile up so
that Bartelstein would eventually clean it up. But
even before living with Bartelstein, Douglass saw
his teammate as a friend he could lean on, some-
thing that only magnified when their rooms were
next door to each other.
"He was the perfect roommate for me," Douglass
said. "From the cleaning to the stories and the help-
ing me out, I couldn't ask for a better roommate or a
better teammate, honestly.
"My parents weren't always there to talk to, or I
wouldn't always want to talk to them on the phone,
so I'd go to Josh. He's genuinely one of the greatest
guys I've ever been around and one of, if not the best
teammate I've ever been around."
Douglass said he first saw Bartelstein take on
a significant leadership role on last season's scout
team. Despite notbeing a prototypical, floor-general
leader, Bartelstein found other ways to lead from the
sidelines and off the court.
"He's not going to get in your face, but when the
time comes, when the moment comes for him to
say something, he's going to say it," Douglass said.
"He's very good at sitting back and reading a situa-
tion, looking at a situation, and looking over all the
information and aspects of what's going on on the
court, off the court, and then being able to talk to
somebody."
After Ohio eliminated Michigan from last year's
postseason, ending the careers of former captains
Novak and Douglass, Beilein approached Bartel-
stein and Burke moments after the team plane land-
ed in Michigan.
"He said, 'Stu and Zack are gone now. You two
are probably our two most natural leaders.' (Becom-
ing captain) was going to be a goal of mine anyway,
but even when coach Beilein recruited me, he said,
'You're going to have to be a leader,' and now it's my
turn," Bartelstein said.
Beilein noted that it's a rarity in his career to
nominate a captain who rarely sees the floor, but
that Bartelstein was the "natural" selection.
"That is the most selfless, team-team-team guy
that I may have ever coached, and as a result, it was
natural," Beilein said in November. "That young
man has the ear of this locker room and also he has
the ear of the coachingstaff, as well."
espite a 24-6 first-half run and 16 sec-
ond-half points from Burke, Indiana -
like Purdue the year before - spoiled Michigan's
senior night.
"It was special beforehand," Bartelstein said.
"But it was all about the game and winning a Big
Ten Championship, so..." his voice trails off. "You
just have to have perspective."
With no more than a month left in his-Michigan
career, perspective is something Bartelstein has
thought about a lot across the past four years.
It's the perspective that, as a self-proclaimed
huge basketball fan, he's "lived an unbelievably
lucky life."

For battered
defense, a late
renaissance

CCHA's worst team
in goals allowed
is experiencing a
playoff rebirth
By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Editor
During the Michigan hockey
team's struggles this year, there
always seemed to be a laun-
dry list of things that needed
improvement - whether it was
defensive-zone coverage, goal-
tending, neutral-zone play or
special teams.
The combination of these dif-
ferent aspects typically resulted
in the Wolverines allowing easy
goals. Sometimes a man would
be left open in front of the net
for a one-time shot that was on
a near-empty net. Other times,
there would be a miscommuni-
cation between the forwards and
the defensemen, resulting in an
odd-man rush and another easy
goal.
Throughout the season, Mich-
igan coach Red Berenson has
continually stressed that until
the team's goals allowed per
game are lowered, the Wolver-
ines won't be where they want
to be. Considering how poor the
defense was for most of the sea-
son - a little more than a month
ago, the Wolverines ranked sec-
ond to last in the entire NCAA in
goals allowed per game - Beren-
son saw only room for improve-
ment.
After last weekend's sweep of
Northern Michigan, Michigan
is currently riding a six-game
winning streak and has vastly

improved on defense. The Wol-
verines have allowed one goal
per game while scoring three
and a half on average in the past
two weeks. To say the defensive
effort has been better wouldn't
be doing it justice - Michigan
looks like a completely different
team behind its blue line.
"(The difference) is just an
attitude," Berenson said. "A
combination of better penalty
killing, better goalkeeping and
better defensive awareness and
defensive responsibility. I'm still
not happy with the goals that we
gave up this weekend."
The inconsistent goaltending
has frequently contributed to the
struggles. Michigan has alter-
nated freshmen Steve Racine
and Jared Rutledge, as well as
junior Adam Janecyk, between
the pipes all season because
none of them earned the job out-
right. But ever since the Ohio
State series that began on Feb.
22 - the start of the Wolverines'
current six-game winning streak
- Racine has been a brick wall
behind the net.
Last season, then-senior
Shawn Hunwick was a goalie
who was consistent night in and
night out and also had his team-
mates' trust to bail them out if
need be. Though Racine hasn't
become that much of a sure
thing, Berenson does believe
that his performances in the past
three weeks have given the team
a confidence boost in its young
netminder.
"I think the defensemen now
aren't as worried about the goal-
ie," he said. "They're now wor-
ried about playing good defense.
There's no question that if you

junior Mac Bennett and fresh-
man Jacob Trouba both notched
goals in Michigan's 6-2 victory.
Add assists from Trouba and
sophomore Mike Szuma, and
that's a defensive unit that fin-
ished a series sweep with five
points.
"That usually means your
team is playing well when
you're getting offense from your
defense," Berenson said.
Whether Berenson is finally
happy with the defense's overall
performance or the unit is finally
living up the preseason hype,
the results speak for themselves.
For a team that has allowed
more than three goals per game
for the entirety of the season -
Michigan's 3.50 goals per game
still rank last in the CCHA - six
goals allowed in the past four
games is impressive.
"It's just everybody buying
in," said senior defenseman Lee
Moffie about the recent suc-
cess. "(The defense) has steadily
been getting better, even in the
past month of the season, and
now that the season is coming
together, the blocked shots and
the extra will to make sure the
puck is getting out helps us alot."

The reigning Big Ten Pitcher
and Freshman of the Year is finally
back.
On Wednesday, sophomore
Haylie Wagner stepped into the
circle for the first time this season
and stared down Central Florida's
leadoff batter. She started her sea-
son - 19 games late due to injury
- with an eight-pitch battle that
ended in a walk. She went on to
throw eight innings in two games
before throwing her first complete
game against Illinois State. Wag-
ner came away with three wins
in her three appearances, proving
that despite starting her season
late, she's ready to help the team.
"It felt really good hearing my
name and hearing that I would
be starting," Wagner said. "Just
knowing that I've gotten back to
the place I want to be and to be
pitching - that's what I love to
do."
In her first two starts, against
the Knights and Miami, Wagner
threw four strikeouts while allow-
ing just four hits, two walks and
surrendering only one earned run
off a home run. She looked her best
during the third inning against
the Hurricanes, when she forced
three straight batters into ground-
outs on just four pitches.
Against the Redbirds, Wagner
pitched a full game,highlighted by
a streak of 13 straight retired bat-
ters. She finished the game with
seven strikeouts and three walks.
The onlyhit she allowed was asolo
home run in the third inning.
"We are going to have to ease
(Wagner) into some innings," said
* Michigan coach Carol Hutchins.
"Whatever innings she gets, she
has to help us win.
"She has to get into the rhythm
and the flow of the season. It's hard
to do that when you're dropped in
the middle of it, but she's going to
get there."
Wagner was named to the
2013 USA Softball National Colle-
giate Player of the Year preseason
watch list after her impressive
freshman season. She's one of just

Josh Bartelstein's rise
from walk-on to captain
by Daniel Wasserman, Daily Sports Editor

M arch 10, Senior Day for the Michi-
gan men's basketball team, was Ann
Arbor's first taste of spring. As temperatures
climbed into the mid 60s, locals ditched their
winter coats in favor of short-sleeve shirts for
the first time this year.
But as the Crisler Center parking lot began
to fill, and the line of student-ticket holders
stretched past the Big House, a grey, cloud-cov-
ered sky served as a constant reminder that win-
ter hadn't yet departed. It was a nice day for the
beginning of spring, but not like the late-April
weekend four years ago, in 2009, when Josh
Bartelstein and his dad, Mark, made their first
and onlyrecruitingvisit to Michigan.
"It was one of those days - the nicest day of
the spring - a perfect day for recruiting," Mark
recalled in a phone interview.
It was on that visit that Bartelstein made
up his mind; he was prepared to accept a pre-
ferred-walk-on offer from Michigan coach John
Beilein. Not more than 24 hours after returning
home, he had formally accepted it.
Four years later, in his final home game as
a Wolverine, Bartelstein didn't score one last
basket. He didn't get to check in, as the crowd
cheered him on, for one final time. His name
wasn't even called over the PA system, except
for when he and the four other seniors - none
of whom received more than a handful of mean-
ingful minutes this season - were honored at
half court 10 minutes before tip-off in a game
Michigan would eventually lose to Indiana,
costing it the Big Ten Championship.
And since that warm April day in 2009, Bar-
telstein has scored just six points in 53-career
minutes - each of them in games that had
long since been decided. He missed 13 of his 15
field-goal attempts and registered more fouls
(eight) than assists (four) and rebounds (two)
combined. It wasn't the career Bartelstein envi-
sioned when he turned to his dad and said, "I
don't think there's anywhere else that I would
go."

But then again, it's six more points than he
ever could've imagined he'd score at a Big Ten
school when he was in high school and felt a
sharp pain in his ankle, or when he had just a
few mid-major offers during his prep-school
season, or even when he traveled to Ann Arbor
for the first time on a trip to visit friends from
high school.
Playing basketball at Michigan was supposed
to be a pipe dream for Josh Bartelstein. Instead,
it's a dream he's lived, led and blogged for four
years.
ong before Bartelstein shared a lock-
er room with NBA talents like former
Michigan guards Darius Morris and Manny
Harris, or future NBA players like Trey Burke,
Tim Hardaway Jr. or Glenn Robinson III, he
was sharing a court with some of the league's
biggest names.
Mark, a prominent basketball agent, rep-
resents NBA All-Stars like David Lee and Mo
Williams, and founded Priority Sports and
Entertainment - which also represents NFL
stars like Arian Foster and A.J. Hawk. It's
through these connections that Bartelstein
has gotten to shoot around with Michael Jor-
dan, or eat dinner with and rebound for Steve
Kerr - another one of Mark's clients - just days
before he hit a last-second, game-winning shot
in Game 6 of the 1997 NBA Finals to clinch the
championship.
Developing relationships with several NBA
players went a long way in Bartelstein's own
development as a basketball player.
"Any time you can be around people who
are successful, and you see how much work
goes into being successful, that's always a great
learning experience," Mark said. "I think to see
how hard these guys actually do work is so ben-
eficial to anyone in any walk of life."
Each winter, when Mark wasn't taking Bar-
telstein to NBA games, or watching games on
the couch with him, the pair found itself in

Highland Park High School's gym, where Bar-
telstein began to "idolize" the varsity players.
Despite being just a 5-foot-6 sophomore, he
was handed the reins to the varsity offense in
2005 as its starting point guard.
In a preseason Thanksgiving tournament
- his first varsity game - Bartelstein played
through a sore ankle and eeked out a two-
point victory. While turning a corner around a
pick-and-roll he had called for the next day in
practice, he felt an "excruciating" pain shoot
through his right ankle, the same one that had
been slightly bothering him the previous day.
"I'llnever forgetthemoment,"hesaid."That's
when I knew, 'That's not normal. There's some-
thingvery wrong with it."'
Tests found a stress fracture. Initial diagnosis
tabbed the recovery period asa matter of weeks,
but further testing discovered the need for sur-
gery - two screws in his ankle - sidelining him
for six-to-eight months. He eventually returned
to the summer AAU circuit, but it wasn't until
midway through his junior year that he felt like
himself on the floor.
The injury, attributed to significant wear and
tear and the side effect of what would become
a substantial growth spurt - over the next two
years, he grew nine inches to his current 6-foot-
3 - was the first in a string of injuries to his
ankle, which has been operated on an additional
two times during his Michigan career.
Seriously injured for the first time in his life,
Bartelstein was forced to find alternative meth-
ods to contribute to the team, including a role as
an informal player-coach.
"I think for my ability to lead, it was a bless-
ing," he said. "That was the first year that I got
to sit back ... and understand the leadership role.
"There's no doubt that that year, seeing the
bigger picture, I would've been too caught up in
myself."
By his senior year, a taller, more polished
Bartelstein had grown into an all-area player,
averaging 13.5 points, six rebounds and five
assists per game - good enough to get recruited

by Division III schools, including Emory, New
York University and Washington University in
St. Louis.
But everything changed after his high school
played a prep school, and its coach approached
the Bartelsteins about the possibility ofhim tak-
ing a post-grad year.
Bartelstein's junior year was hampered by
the recovering ankle, a hamstring injury and
because the growth spurt changed the physi-
cal makeup of his body, he was going through
what Mark called an "awkward phase" on the
court. The prep-school route wasn't something
that Midwesterners, like the Bartelsteins, were
familiar with.
Spending a year at a prep school - a more
common route for East Coast athletes - would
give Bartelstein the chance to improve upon his
senior year and get more recruiting attention,
especially from the Ivy League.
Bartelstein eventually settled on Phillips
Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H. Known for its
prestigious academics, it also plays in an athletic
conference littered with Division I talent. Mich-
igan coach John Beilein, a native Northeast-
erner, has dipped into this conference several
times to snag freshman forward Mitch McGary,
senior forward Blake McLimans and former
Wolverine Evan Smotrycz.
At Exeter, Bartelstein was named captain
of the basketball team for the 2008-09 season.
While maturing off the court, he shined on it
- averaging 15.5 points and seven assists per
game. He set the school record with 52 3-point-
ers in a season, while shooting close to 50 per-
cent from beyond the arc.
Several Division-I schools jumped in with
offers, including San Diego, Detroit, Valparaiso,
Harvard and a host of otherIvy League schools.
Penn recruited him the hardest, and for a
while, that's where it looked like he'd end up.
