Gov. Rick Snyder recently 

sparked 
controversy 
by 

appointing Bishop Ira Combs 
Jr. to the Michigan Civil 
Rights Commission. Combs, 
a Republican and Pentecostal 
minister in Jackson, is well-
known for condemning pro-
LGBT legislation. However, 
Snyder 
said 
he 
appointed 

Combs 
because 
of 
his 

background in fighting for 
racial justice and people with 
disabilities.

In February 2017, Combs 

outwardly 
opposed 
an 

ordinance 
that 
would 
ban 

discrimination 
against 

individuals 
in 
the 
LGBT 

community. The Jackson City 
Council eventually passed the 
ordinance with 5 in support 
and 2 against the vote.

Combs’ anti-LGBT record 

dates back farther than 2017. 
He has supported anti-LGBT 
lawsuits, including defending 
marriage 
discrimination 

against same-sex couples. He 
also opposed the formation 
of a Gay-Straight Alliance at 
Jackson High School.

The Michigan Civil Rights 

Commission is an eight-person 
body that investigates civil 
rights complaints and proposes 
legislation to the governor. 

Speaking of their experiences 

wearing the hijab, the pressures 
hijabi 
women 
face 
in 
the 

United States to compromise 
their identity and the unique 
significance it carries in their 
own lives were several hijabi 
women who spoke as part 
of the second annual Hijabi 
Monologues commenced Friday 
night in the packed Rackham 
Amphitheatre.

LSA 
sophomore 
Ayah 

Kutmah, 
co-coordinator 
of 

Hijabi Monologues, said the 
annual event was created last 
year 
after 
the 
presidential 

election to combat a surge in 
hate crimes against Muslim 
women. 

“Last year was much more 

reactionary in a sense that as 
we did it specifically in response 
to Trump and the increase in 
hate crimes, but this year, not 
to say that the hate crimes and 
Islamophobia doesn’t exist, it 
was a continuation of giving 
people voices,” Kutmah said.

Some of the speakers spoke 

of the insensitive comments 
they’ve 
received 
in 
their 

hometowns and the Ann Arbor 
community, and how even in a 
progressive city, Islamophobia 
still occurs. Other women spoke 
about their decision to wear the 
hijab and how their encounters 
with 
the 
community 
were 

modified.

LSA junior Alyiah Al-Bonijim, 

fellow 
co-coordinator 
of 

Hijabi 
Monologues, 
said 

she hopes people will walk 
away from the event with a 
greater understanding of the 
complexities of being a hijabi 
woman.

“I think the main takeaway 

from the event is the nuances 
every hijabi women has in her 
experiences wearing the hijab, 
as well as what led her to wear 
the 
hijab,” 
Al-Bonijim 
said. 

“Because even in the narrative 
of Hijabi women, it tends to be 
homogenous, where it doesn’t 
take into account our various 
identities, that influence why we 
wear it.”

LSA freshman Nada Eldawy 

explained she came to the event 
partly because of her sister’s 
recent decision to wear the hijab.

“It was really nice to come 

and 
hear 
people’s 
personal 

narratives, because I feel like 

there’s a story that’s always 
spread 
about 
the 
hijab 
as 

oppressive, 
and 
I 
liked 

hearing people challenge that 
stereotype,” she said. “Especially 
because 
my 
sister 
recently 

started wearing the hijab and it 
was nice to hear people who had 
similar stories to her, and that it 
doesn’t have to be a stigma.”

On 
Saturday 
night, 
close 

to 1,400 students, faculty and 
community 
members 
flocked 

to the Power Center for the 
Performing Arts to attend Arab 
Xpressions — the University’s 
annual 
showcase 
of 
Arabic 

culture. Xpressions is organized 
by the Arab Student Association, 
and featured Arab dances, skits, 
poetry and student talent to 
celebrate the beginning of Arab 
Heritage Month. It is the only 
Arab culture show produced on 
such a large scale at the University 
of Michigan.

LSA seniors Jad Elharake 

and Haleemah Aqel were the 
hosts of the event. On stage, they 
described how Arab Xpressions 
had transformed in terms of 
attendance and venue, year by 
year. Starting in the dorms, it 
was later moved to the Angell 
Hall Courtyard computing site 
–– commonly known as the 
Fishbowl –– then the Diag, the 
Michigan League and finally the 
Power Center.

LSA sophomore Lexi Michaels 

wasn’t expecting to be late to her 
Psychology 280 exam. In fact, 
she thought she was early. But 
when she walked into the testing 
accommodations 
room 
a 
few 

minutes after 2:30 — she’d run 
there right from her last class — she 
realized the exam was not being 
administered on Michigan time, 
and everyone else had already 
started.

“My 
expectation 
was 
that 

it would (start on Michigan 
time), because that’s what most 
of my classes and exams start 

on, even if they’re in a testing 
accommodations room,” Michaels 
said. “And it didn’t. I walked in 
really flustered. I was like, ‘Are they 
going to let me take the exam?’”

After 
the 
initial 
scare, 

everything turned out fine for 
Michaels. She was still given a full 
two hours to take her exam, and no 
one was angry at her for coming in 

late. However, start time confusion 
is common at the University of 
Michigan, and the administration 
has decided it’s time to take action.

Starting May 1, no University 

classes will run on Michigan time,

Patrick Doyle, CEO of Domino’s 

Pizza, discussed the importance 
of data analytics as part of the 
Economics at Work lecture series 
Friday. Doyle graduated from the 
University of Michigan with a 
degree in economics in 1985 and 
began working at Domino’s in 1997.

Doyle began by discussing the 

company’s 
revitalization 
under 

his direction and illustrated their 
three-step plan for success. The 
company began by refining their 
pizza flavors, improving customer 
convenience and developing their 
data analytics system. Since the 
implementation of these programs, 
Domino’s 
has 
seen 
dramatic 

progress in their business.

In 2009, Domino’s released a 

commercial depicting customer 
dissatisfaction in the taste and 
quality 
of 
their 
product. 
In 

the 
advertisement, 
Domino’s 

emphasized it’s desire to improve 
their flavor and brand.

“To date, we remain the only 

brand ever to go out and spend 
tens of millions of dollars to tell 
customers exactly how crappy 
our pizza is,” Doyle said. “We

Prom may be a rite of passage 

for most high school students 
but often poses a large financial 
burden. Ann Arbor resident Jan 
Wery, along with several other 
volunteers, founded the Prom 
Dress Project — an organization 
that 
collects 
donated 
prom 

dresses and sells them for $25 or 
less — to address this issue.

According to Wery, donations 

for the prom dress sale continue to 
grow every year, and this year, the 
project has once again achieved a 
new record of donations. Now in 
its sixth year, this year’s annual 
sale will be the biggest yet. The 
event will feature 500 long prom 
dresses and 100 shorter dresses, 
all between $10 and $25 and 
including sizes 0 to 20.

Volunteers have helped to build 

dressing rooms for the event, 
which will take place March 
11 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the 
Holiday Inn on Plymouth Road. 
Volunteers will also be available 
to help students pick out and try 
on dresses.

“It’s gotten so much bigger and 

so many donations,” Wery said in 
an interview with MLive. “The 
community is so generous. The 
dresses that come in are just really 
beautiful.”

In prior years, Wery stored 

the project’s donations in the 
basement of her home, but this 
year’s donations have outgrown 
that space, so Wery rented storage 
to accommodate the increased 
amount.

According to Wery, she first 

conceived the idea when she was 
working in an Ann Arbor thrift 
shop. Wery was disappointed 
students didn’t shop for prom 
dresses in the thrift shop, despite 
the store having beautiful dresses 
available.

“Girls weren’t coming to shop 

for a prom dress at the thrift shop. 
... But there were some very pretty 
dresses,” Wery said. “That’s when 
I decided we’ve got to have a 
special place and a special day for 
girls to come for prom dresses.”

Wery also noticed how the 

prom dresses the thrift shop 
received were in great condition 
because most students wore their 
dresses for only one night. While 
most dresses donated to the 

project are in excellent condition, 
Wery cleans all of the dresses 
and makes small repairs when 
necessary to make sure every 
dress is stunning.

Wery said her favorite moment 

is when a girl finds a dress.

“It’s just so much fun when 

they get the dress that is meant 
for them,” Wery said. “They 
put it on and the smiles are just 
unbelievable.”

The 
group 
welcomes 
any 

student 
in 
the 
Washtenaw 

County area to come to the 
event and look for a prom dress. 
Wery emphasized the group 
accepts donations year-round. To 
donate a dress, send an email to 
A2promdressproject@comcast.
net. 

ON THE DAILY: ANN ARBORITE PROVIDES DRESS RELIEF

University tradition that dates 
back to the 1930s. Students and 
professors used to time their 
classes according to the chimes of 
the Burton Tower at the beginning 
of each hour, and Michigan time 
was officially adopted to allow 
students to get from class to class 
without being late.Now, to allow 
for students to get to back-to-back 
classes, all classes will stop 10 
minutes before the hour.

Though administrators have 

been 
talking 
about 
removing 

Michigan time for many years 
now — University Provost Martin 
Philbert said there have been 
conversations since he came to 
the University in 1995 — this is the 
first time anything conclusive has 
passed. The change will start in 
May for the Spring and Summer 
terms, so any unexpected kinks 
can be worked out before the Fall 
2018 semester.

“The freshmen will come in not 

knowing a time we had it,” Philbert 
said.

 According to Philbert, it was a 

“tradition born out of necessity.”

Now, 
however, 
some 
see 

the 
once-crucial 
tradition 
as 

a 
hinderance. 
Many 
newer 

University schools never adopted 

it, and Patricia Hurn, dean of the 
School of Nursing, told The Daily 
in an email Michigan time was 
never an option for the Nursing 
School.

“The major reason our classes 

have not used Michigan Time 
is because we are a clinical 
discipline,” Hurn wrote. “So we 
very early on aligned our class 
times, specifically the on-the-
hour start time, with the time 
of our clinical partners. None of 
these partners recognize or utilize 
‘Michigan time.’”

Problems 
arise 
when 

University units aren’t operating 
on synchronized schedules, and 
because programs like Nursing 
don’t have the option of Michigan 

time, Philbert thinks going to 
“clock time” is the most logical 
course of action.

One of the major issues the 

new system aims to fix is the 
shortage of classrooms. When 
some schools are on Michigan 
time and others are not, 
classrooms are unavailable for 
up to 10 minutes at the end of 
the hour.

“We have the need for 

more classrooms,” Philbert 
said. “We have more sections, 
which require more rooms, 
and some of these rooms 
require specialized services. 
So by aligning time, we free 
up the number and types of 
classrooms available.”

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
is also hoping the switch 
will 
make 
collaboration 

among different schools and 
departments easier.

“I’d say one of the hallmarks 

of 
our 
campus 
is 
cross-

University 
collaboration,” 

Fitzgerald said. “From school 
and colleges and departments 
and different units who are 
constantly 
cross-pollinating 

all of our efforts, and this really 
facilitates 
that… 
We’re 
just 

eliminating one of those stumbling 
blocks.”

Though there are clear benefits 

for faculty and administrators, 
students are uncertain about the 
upcoming change. Michaels, even 
after her exam confusion, thinks 
Michigan time works well. She’s 
concerned professors will have a 
difficult time stopping 10 minutes 
short of the hour.

“I really like Michigan time. 

I think it makes so much sense, 
especially when you have back-to-
back classes,” she said. “It gets your 
day rolling. I think that (this new 
system) is just a cause for disaster. I 
think that professors are way more 
aware of starting 10 minutes late 
because they haven’t started yet, 
but if they have to end 10 minutes 
early, they’re not going to know to 
stop.”

While Michaels understands 

this could eventually be a good 
system, the thought of working 
through 
the 
transition 
next 

semester is daunting.

“It’s going to be a huge transition 

and it’s going to mess a lot of people 
up with their schedules,” Michaels 
said. “I don’t think this is a good 
idea, but that’s just because I’m 
used to Michigan time and I think 
that this is working well so I don’t 
see why you should change what’s 
already working and what people 
like.”

On the other hand, Philbert 

said he’s received a lot of positive 
feedback about the change from 
students and faculty.

“Especially 
through 
Vice 

President Royster’s office, we 
have worked with many student 
organizations,” Philbert said. “In 
my experience there’s been an 
enormous sigh of relief that we’re 
all going to be operating on the 
same expectations of starting and 
finishing.”

launched on Monday with that 
advertisement and by Wednesday 
we were up double-digits… it was 
the strongest quarter in the history 
of public restaurant companies at 
the time.”

Domino’s 
recognized 
the 

advantages of redesigning their 
stores 
and 
identifying 
more 

convenient locations for customers. 
They realized the effects of location 
on their customer’s purchasing 
habits and positioned their stores 
accordingly.

“People will not walk past 

five other pizza places to pick 
up a pizza,” Doyle said. “I don’t 
care how good your pizza is, 
convenience starts to override 
the quality of the food. Basically, 
people will not go more than a mile 
to pick up their pizza — for the 
most part, they won’t go more than 

a half a mile — this means we have 
to have more stores.”

Doyle also emphasized the 

value of data analytics and media 
design for business success.

“Data drives everything: We 

know who our customers are, 
we know what they eat, which 
devices they prefer, we know 
where they receive their messages 
and most importantly, we know 
what changes purchase behavior 
and have modeled all of that and 
know exactly what it’s going to do,” 

Doyle said. “Math is driving our 
business.”

He 
provided 
an 
example 

of research on the function of 
Domino’s 
website 
allowing 

customers 
to 
order 
online. 

Domino’s realized the difference 
between the term “order” and 
“order online” led to a 0.86 percent 
increase in the number of people 
who purchased.

It is Feb. 16 at the time I am 

writing this. To some of you, today 
will have been just another Friday. 
To me and others, however, today 
is New Year’s Day, a time not only 
for festivities, but also reflection. 
Recently, the political correctness 
of “Chinese New Year” has been 
called into question, and I wanted 
to take this opportunity to share 
my thoughts on the issue and 
explore its relation to my own 
identities. 

Let us travel back about 13 

years to a Midwestern elementary 
school, where my first-grade class 
received a “cultural lesson” on 
Chinese New Year.

In reality, this meant learning 

a couple sayings in Cantonese, 
folding 
red 
envelopes 
and 

snacking on fortune cookies. 
Many of my classmates started 
turning to me as if to seek some 
sort of confirmation; I suppose it 
was because I was the only Asian-
American in the room. To their 
surprise, I vehemently denied any 
previous involvement with the 
holiday.

“I celebrate Vietnamese New 

Year,” I insisted.

At first, the Vietnamese and 

Chinese New Years may not seem 
too different. They usually begin 
on the same day because they are 
both based on a lunar calendar, 
which the Vietnamese adopted 
from the Chinese. Millennia of 
cultural exchange have also led 
to 
similarities 
in 
celebratory 

activities, such as giving pocket 
money to children and watching 
lion dances. If you look beyond 
the surface, though, you will see 
there are traditions unique to 
each culture. For example, eating 
sticky rice cakes (bánh chung) is 
a distinctly Vietnamese tradition, 
one that is tied to the ascension of 
Prince Lang Liêu. 

Several Asian cultures have a 

Lunar New Year, though the exact 
time varies. There’s the Korean 
Seollal, Mongolian Tsagaan Sar 
and Tibetan Losar, just to name a 
few. Jewish and Muslim holidays 
are based on a lunar calendar, too.

The term “Chinese New Year” 

becomes problematic when we fail 
to realize there are non-Chinese 
peoples who celebrate their own 
versions of the Lunar New Year, 
some of which have no historical 
ties to China. I acknowledge 

that China has made major 
contributions to the cultures of 
its neighboring countries, but I 
believe referring to the New Year 
as “Chinese” across the board 
asserts Chinese dominance, while 
ignoring the incorporation of local 
customs. It reinforces the false 
view of Asians as a monolithic 
group. In the process of dispelling 
assumptions about who I am and 
the cultures to which I belong, I 
feel it is necessary to specify that 
I celebrate Vietnamese New Year. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

But 
of 
course, 
there 
are 

complications. 

It has been pointed out to 

me that I don’t use any cultural 
markers when referring to Jan. 1 
— I just call it “New Year.” Doing 
so suggests that this New Year 
is the norm, yet I have always 
celebrated both Jan. 1 and the 
Vietnamese New Year with the 
same amount of familiarity. I 
manage to other-ize half of the 
traditions in which I participate. 
I think this is an unavoidable 
consequence of trying to express 
the Vietnamese part of my 
identity through the English 
language. Lunar New Year is 
known as Tet in Vietnamese, 
which simply means “beginning 
of the year,” but because English-

speaking 
countries 
celebrate 

the beginning of the year on a 
different day (as determined by 
the Gregorian calendar rather 
than a lunar one), it becomes 
necessary to distinguish between 
the two New Years. Since most 
people in, say, the United States 
will assume I’m referring to Jan. 
1 when I speak of “New Year.” It 
becomes almost natural for me to 
place the cultural marker on New 
Years that begin any other day.

It is a strange situation because 

it seems as though I am feeding into 
the perpetual foreigner syndrome 
on one level and going mad with 
political correctness on another. 
Even the labels I have chosen for 
myself don’t quite offer sufficient 
explanations. The part of me that 
ends up as the “Other” depends 
on the language I am using. It is 
just as true that my American side 
sounds foreign when I speak of it 
in Vietnamese. Certain concepts 
behind American traditions don’t 
exist in Vietnamese culture, so it 
is hard to directly translate. 

To be honest, I am not sure 

what the solution is. Perhaps my 
best option is to make do with 
what I have until I discover ways 
to express some of my identities 
without undermining the rest.

The time is late. I do not even 

have to check my clock to tell. 
What started as a crusade in 
my bed has slowly crept its way 
to having set my alarm on my 
phone, plugging my phone into 
my charger and sitting cross-
legged on my carpeted apartment 
floor. Outside, the normal buzz of 
campus, so alive during the day, 
has died down. It is hard to believe 
it is the same place during the day. 
My roommate has already fallen 

asleep and even the drunk party-
goers have stumbled back to their 
places.

The white glow from my 

smartphone illuminates my face 
as I scroll through organization 
after 
organization 
on 
Maize 

pages, another thing to pad the 
résumé, another thing to self-
improve. The familiar touch of 
flesh on glass guides my thumb 
along. “Come on Young, just put 
it to rest,” I think, but my thumb 
keeps scrolling, unable to silence 
the voice in my head.

There are not many things 

that Americans praise more than 

the rugged individual, one of the 
bedrocks of American ideals. 
Pull yourself up by your own 
bootstraps. The value of a life 
well-lived determined by the wear 
and tear of your boots. Perhaps 
even to the point you aren’t even 
wearing 
boots 
anymore 
and 

are just walking barefoot with 
cracked skin and blisters. Society 
lauds the student who is part of 17 
organizations and somehow still 
goes to class and excels.

The interesting thing about 

America is that it is not enough to 
just have people suffering in our 
country, but there are institutions, 
policies and groups that are 
established to keep the poor and 
marginalized suffering. Society 
looks at homeless folks and people 
with addictions and boxes them 
and their humanity into the effort 
they put in life and are so eager to 
see them suffer because of it.

The reality society has to face 

is that the stereotypical welfare 
mom 
who’s 
working 
several 

part-time jobs is not putting in 
any less “effort” than the CEO of 
the Fortune 500 company. Yet, 
society never lauds the mom, 
but we always hear about the 
CEO. Do we buy this message 
because it is easier to do so? Do 
we simplify the issue down to lack 
of effort just because it removes 
our 
responsibility 
to 
others 

and the weight on our moral 
conscious if the real issue is more 
complex? Society does not want 
to acknowledge mental health. 

It does not want to acknowledge 
upbringing 
and 
access 
to 

opportunities 
and 
resources. 

Rather society sees what it sees 
and attributes it to laziness.

Society is so caught up on in our 

nation of fairness because people 
expect things for their hard work. 
If people work hard, then things 
should automatically be given to 
them. It is not fair if others are just 
as successful for minimal effort. 
People are so eager to make other 
people try just as hard too, using 
the few anomalies of individuals 
living off the system to justify a 
whole. The person serving food 
in the dining hall who is trying to 
get to medical school has all the 
same hopes and ambitions as the 
one who has all the tutors in the 
world.

And the thing is, I bought this 

message, hard. The biggest lie I 
ever believed in. It also was not 
even just about myself; it affected 
how I viewed other people too. 
In third grade, I participated in 
a bike race for elementary school 
students. After the race, I was 
eating pizza with my family when 
a homeless man walked by and 
started rummaging through the 
trash for remnants of food. I asked 
my dad why that man was looking 
through the garbage. Wasn’t that 
gross? Seeing an opportunity for 
a life lesson, my dad told me that 
was how people ended up if they 
didn’t make good life decisions 
and choices. If they didn’t work 
hard enough. I have forgotten the 

rest of the conversation from that 
day, but I will always remember 
those words. In high school, it 
became the reason my peers were 
in regular classes and struggling 
to pass. In my ignorant view, they 
just did not work hard enough (no 
longer do I hold these beliefs). 

More effort became the answer 

to everything for me. Don’t like 
how your life is shaping up? 
Simple. Just try harder. Always 
forward. Crunch every minute 
out of every day. Just do it. If 
you’re not going somewhere, then 
you’re not worthy. If you’re not 
producing, then you’re falling 
behind. Leaders and the best. So I 
numbed myself. I got busy to the 
point where it all blended together. 
Escalating to the summer after my 
freshman year when I had to quit 
everything instead of being able 
to achieve everything I had set 
to do. Procrastinating was never 
my issue. Instead, it was always 
seeking more. At least this way, I 
was “moving” or “progressing” 
onto something else. It became 
a weight on my shoulders that I 
did not know how to be without. I 
craved the anxiety being busy gave 
me. I became my harshest critic; 
nitpicking every little thing about 
me. If I was obsessed enough, then 
things would work out.

I am not saying setting goals 

and striving is bad. However, with 
rates of anxiety and depression for 
students climbing every year, this 
obsessive, borderline-stalker love 
affair with effort is toxic and must 

stop. It is perpetually feeding this 
cycle to the point other people 
become seen as nuisances and 
hindrances to personal goals 
and ambitions. We will continue 
to achieve things if we keep the 
status quo, but will we get there 
in pieces or will we get there 
enjoying the process? Life doesn’t 
have to feel like a series of putting 
out fires. Stop and take a pause. 
Take time for self-care, not only 
for you but because it will affect 
those around you as well. Whether 
it be personal, career or societal, 
let’s aim for progress that is truly 
progress rather than just the 
results. Let’s stop the comparison 
game of always defining success 
by borderline burnout. Hard work 
and dedication are important, but 
at what cost?

I 
confess 
my 
love 
affair 

with 
hard 
work, 
my 
own 

Shakespearean sonnet. It is the 
thing I am not complete without, 
the thing that keeps me up at 
night. It’s the thing that causes me 
to ignore my own well-being. You 
see, diligence is intimately tied 
with my Asian yellow immigrant 
skin. It symbolizes my mother, 
always serving. During the week, 
she tenderly cares for patients at 
the hospital; at home, she cooks 
food and does laundry and, on 
the weekends, she is serving at 
church. Her hands are never still.

As soon as I heard Marvel 

was planning to create a Black 
superhero movie, I was psyched. I 
love Marvel and as a Black person 
and a Nigerian, it wasn’t that hard 
to notice the lack of representation 
in Marvel movies as I grew up. 
But I knew the release of “Black 
Panther” would change that. A 
movie taking place in Africa that 
doesn’t show it in a degrading light 
with a soundtrack produced by the 
legendary Kendrick Lamar? It was 
perfect.

The one thing I think I loved 

the most about the movie was 
the portrayal of the fictional 
African country, Wakanda. Most 
times when African countries are 
created for movies, it’s so it can be 
portrayed as a terrible third world 
country without actually insulting 
any real African countries. But 
the movie portrayed Wakanda, 
supposedly set in Central Africa, 
as a gorgeous, technologically-
advanced place, with a rich culture 
and vibrant thriving people. It 
effectively showed the Africa that 
I see and love, instead of just the 
stereotypes 
and 
exaggerations 

we’re all made to believe.

Not only was the portrayal of 

the country Wakanda positive, 
it accurately captured different 
African cultures as well. Their 
vernacular, accents and languages 
reminded me of the way Nigerians 
spoke. The clothes they wore were 
similar to something someone 
in Nigeria would wear, and their 
dances and chants reminded me of 
ceremonies and family gatherings 
back home. They were also able 
to intertwine the supernatural 
aspect of superhero stories with 
the mystique and sacredness of 
African traditions and folklore 
without ridicule.

Another thing I loved about the 

movie was how they touched upon 
the complex dynamic between 
Africans and African Americans. 
As a first-generation immigrant 
Nigerian living in the United 
States, it’s easy for me to see this 
disconnect. Even though they’re 
both Black, Africans and African 
Americans 
don’t 
always 
see 

themselves as the same people, as 
African Americans’ identities are 
more strongly tied to the United 
States while Africans’ identities 
are more closely tied to their home 
countries in Africa. Thus, Africans 
(including those living in America) 

and 
African-Americans 
don’t 

always see the need to support 
each other as they don’t always see 
themselves as the same people.

This is brought up in the 

movie when the character Erik 
Killmonger wants to use the 
resources of Wakanda to help the 
disenfranchised Black people in 
the United States. This is because 
he’s 
half 
African 
American, 

half Wakandan and grew up in 
America. This is contrary to the 
Wakandans who only believe that 
“their people” are only Wakandan 
people, not other Black people 
across the diaspora, which is 
extremely analogous to Africans 
and the lack of unity between 
them and African Americans.

The 
dynamic 
between 

Africans and African Americans 
is a concept that is typically not 
explored in present-day media 
and culture and, as someone who 
finds it prevalent in their everyday 
life, I’m extremely glad “Black 
Panther” decided to tackle it.

The last thing I loved about 

“Black Panther” that I have to 
talk about is the amazing Black 
cast and the portrayal of Black 
women. The female characters 
in “Black Panther” RAN that 
movie. The country of Wakanda 

literally had an army solely 
made up of women, women who 
were willing to put anything on 
the line to defend their country 
and the throne. King T’Challa’s 
younger sister Shuri was SINGLE-
HANDEDLY 
IN 
CHARGE 

OF 
ALL 
TECHNOLOGICAL 

ADVANCEMENTS 
AND 

INNOVATIONS IN THE NATION. 
Okay yes, maybe a 16 year old 
being in charge of a whole nation’s 
technological section was a little 
far-fetched. But I’m completely 
fine with Marvel making things 
a little unrealistic at times if 
it’s with the intent of creating 
powerful 
women 
characters. 

Besides the female cast, the rest 
of the Black cast was extremely 
amazing and it was refreshing to 
see so many powerful, humanized 
Black figures up on the screen. 
Additionally, many were actual 
African 
actors, 
which 
was 

extremely inspiring to see as an 
aspiring African actress.

I could go on about this movie 

for many more paragraphs, but all 
in all I found the movie amazing 
and extremely well done. It was 
full of powerful characters, actors 
and actresses that I, along with 
multiple others, will look up to for 
a long time.

I am sorry, but exclusively 

dating white women is not “just 
a preference.”

At the root of your exclusion 

of women of color from your 
dating pool lies a deep-seated 
allegiance to whiteness so that 
you and your kin can continue 
to benefit from white privilege. 
Further, straying from white 
women as your 
partners 
of 

choice 
could 

have dastardly 
consequences 
that result in 
the 
dilution 

of your family 
and your own 
perceived 
whiteness.

So, 
let’s 

make it clear: 
No one is the 
passive victim 
of their own 
internalized 
biases. It is not a coincidence that 
the girl that you had relations 
with last week looks like your 
sister, mom, aunt or the random 
Gap ad you found yourself 
staring at for a little too long.

You have had choices this 

cuffing season and every other 
cuffing season. And to think that 
you don’t, or that your romantic 
attraction is out of your control, 
you’re kidding both yourself and 
everyone around you.

You exclusively date white 

women 
because 
trying 
to 

understand 
someone 
else’s 

world is too difficult — and white 
privilege is as valuable as gold 
in a country overflowing with 
Trump apologists and white 
resentment.

Not to mention, there is a 

worldwide cultural obsession 
with 
looking, 
acting 
and 

appealing 
to 
whiteness 
in 

romance. Many women of color 

are encouraged from a young age 
to use skin-lightening creams, 
use apps to make their eyes 
wider and conform to white 
societal standards of beauty. 
The entire world is tied into this 
white privilege.

And you, Mr. “I-only-date-

white-girls” 
reinforce 
the 

intrinsic value of whiteness in 
this nation.

Saying that you “prefer” white 

women is racist. Well, maybe not 
racist to you, except it’s hard 
for me to find another word to 

refer to someone 
making negative 
assessments 
of 

large groups of 
individuals that 
they’ve 
never 

met, based solely 
on 
the 
color 

of 
their 
skin. 

It’s 
ultimately 

a 
bigoted 
and 

harmful 
way 

to think about 
potential 
partners.

Saying 
that 

you 
prefer 

certain women to others not 
only 
reinforces 
stereotypes 

about women of color, but white 
women too. Arguing that you 
prefer 
white 
women 
based 

on the presuppositions that 
white women are inherently 
more beautiful, passive, kind 
or financially-stable is — you 
guessed it — racist!

And not only is it racist, but it’s 

insincere.

You know that a white woman 

will let you ignore your privilege 
a lot more than a woman of color 
will. Shoot, a majority of white 
women voted for Trump. For the 
most part, women of color aren’t 
going to put up with that. Unless 
her name is Omarosa.

Let me be clear: I don’t 

expect you to reject your white 
privilege.

But don’t act like you don’t 

have it, like you’re not protecting 
it or that it doesn’t exist.

I 

hope I speak for a lot of 
people somewhat left of 
center when I say that the 

Republican 
Party’s 
capability 

for hypocrisy can be amazing 
— we’ve spent years listening to 
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY., 
grumble 
about 
spendthrift 

Democrats, and those of us from 
the South and Midwest have 
heard a thousand different ways 
the communist, Muslim, socialist, 
President Barack Obama was 
going to waste our tax money. 
And then — just last week — the 
White House published a budget 
that would add $984 billion to the 
deficit in 2019. What happened to 
the party of fiscal discipline?

The answer lies in the way 

the Democratic and Republican 
Parties are composed — we see 
them as mirror images of each 
other, with only ideology to 
distinguish them, but the real 
differences run deeper. What 
looks like hypocrisy to the 
Democratic Party can often be 
explained by differences in the 
Republican Party’s structure.

In the book “Asymmetric 

Politics,” Matt Grossmann and 
David A. Hopkins argue the 
modern Democratic Party is 
based on a coalition of people 
who are united in their identity 
as disadvantaged peoples or the 
allies thereof. The LGBT social 
movement allies with the feminist 
movement to vote Democrat, 
not because they necessarily 
agree on tax policy, but because 
Democrats represent them both 
as interest groups harmed by the 
status quo.

Similarly, Democrats unite 

the 
majority 
of 
Americans 

minorities, 
not 
because 
the 

composite groups necessarily 
agree 
about 
whether 
the 

minimum wage should be $12 
or $15 an hour, but because they 
share an interest in protections 
for disenfranchised groups and 
the Republican Party doesn’t — 
not at the same level, at least.

The 
Republican 
Party, 

conversely, 
is 
based 
on 

ideological identity. It helps 
that the Republican electorate 
is somewhat homogenous — 
most of their voters are white, 
straight and over 35 — but the 
most important factor seems 
to be that Republicans are 
ideologically conservative.

An example from recent 

political history comes to mind: 
former 
Gov. 
Mark 
Sanford, 

R-S.C., vanished for a week 
in 2011 to visit his mistress in 
Argentina, and still managed to 
beat the Democratic candidate 
— Elizabeth Colbert Busch — in 
a 2013 race for the U.S. House of 
Representatives. Colbert Busch 
didn’t lose because she wasn’t a 
white heterosexual female — she 
was — she lost because Sanford 
could better demonstrate his 
conservative identity.

The Republican Party is, to 

condense the above, primarily 
rooted in the perception of 
oneself 
as 
a 
conservative: 

individual policies — more 
spending 
on 
defense, 
or 

defunding Planned Parenthood 
— 
don’t 
really 
matter 
so 

long as party politicians can 
clearly 
demonstrate 
their 

conservative ideology.

I’m not trying to make a value 

judgement. 
Democrats 
aren’t 

worse for their lack of a central 
ideology, and Republicans aren’t 
worse for their indifference over 
individual policy concerns. The 
divide, though, explains why 
liberals and conservatives can’t 
always see the coherence in their 
opponents’ actions.

This 
also 
explains 
the 

seeming 
paradox 
in 
which 

Americans tend to be liberal 
on an issue-by-issue basis but 
most 
describe 
themselves 

as 
overall 
moderates 
or 

conservatives. 
Whichever 

side of this dichotomy is more 
important to someone might 
be what determines their party 
alliance — and it would explain 
why someone like Trump can 
get away with suggesting both 
universal health care and legally 
penalizing women who seek 
abortions. Policy concerns aren’t 
necessarily what determine a 
voter’s behavior.

Other recent trends — like 

negative 
partisanship 
and 

polarization — interact with 
this 
disparity 
to, 
honestly, 

give a campaigning advantage 
to 
Republicans. 
Their 
core 

electorate is willing to go cycle 
after cycle (think the Obama 
years after 2010) without any 
real policy victories because 
their representatives are seen 
as fighting the good fight. The 
Democratic electorate, on the 
other hand, is far less forgiving 
of 
policy 
failures, 
such 
as 

the Democratic wobbling on 
whether or not the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
policy is worth a government 
shutdown 
has 
become 

divisive among potential 2020 
presidential contenders.

When people on the left try 

to analyze the right wing, they 
should avoid using a Democratic 
mindset to interpret Republican 
behavior. Students who work 
for (or will eventually work for) 
campaigns and student activists 
have to remember that the way 
they think about politics is often 
shaped by what the party with 
which they identify.

I think it’s legitimate to make 

one’s case using reasons that are 
less than practical. I support 
DACA 
because 
Dreamers 

shouldn’t 
have 
their 
lives 

destabilized. I support a higher 
minimum wage because people 
deserve to support themselves if 
they work full time. I also think 
that there are times to avoid this, 
though; the goal is to actually 
translate your ideas into to 
legislation and have them signed 
into law.

When 
we 
evaluate 
our 

current environment and find 
it flawed, there has to be a step 
before action when practical 
reality is considered. How will 
this look to the opposition? Is 
this viable, given the way it will 
be evaluated? Can we, given 
the composition of our party, 
really pursue this strategy? In 
a political environment where 
partisan conflict has become 
one of the most important 
influencing factors, cross-party 
conversation has to be tailored to 
the way each side sees itself and 
its opposition.

Are we being close minded to open mindedness?

O

n my way home from 
class today, I thought 
about what it would 

be like to be shot. What would 
I do if someone opened fire 
right here, right now?

I glanced at a snow bank 

that had piled up on the 
side of the sidewalk from 
daily plowing. I could hide 
behind that. I could try to 
dig myself an area where I 
would 
be 
concealed 
from 

view, hopefully out of sight 
and out of mind. I thought 
back to when I was a kid, and 
my brother and I would hide 
in the piles of leaves that had 
collected on the side of roads 
so we could jump up to scare 
the drivers going by.

Since then, I’ve frequently 

thought about what would 
have happened if a car had 
driven over the pile of leaves 
instead of around. The same 
thoughts came to me now, 
considering the permeable safe 
haven of a snowbank. It definitely 
wouldn’t stop any bullets.

While I was eating lunch 

today, I thought about what it 
would be like for my brother 
or sisters to be shot. What 
would they do if someone 
opened fire at their school? I 
have a sister in middle school, 
and two more siblings in high 
school. What if their school 
were the next scene of yet 
another mass shooting?

I thought back to when 

I was younger, to the times 
when I’d sneak out of my 
school 
to 
go 
buy 
lunch 

somewhere, even though we 
had a closed campus. I always 
walked back into school with 
no problems, often to an 
empty lunch room, with no 
one to testify if I looked even 

remotely like I belonged there.

I’ve been back a couple 

times since I’ve graduated, 
and not much has changed. 
I’ve never been stopped to be 
asked who I am, or what I was 
doing there, or what my bag or 
jacket concealed. No one would 
be there to stop any bullets.

During a fundraiser for 

my 
student 
organization 

today, I thought about who 
I would call if people in this 
room were shot. Who would 
I want to call during my last 
moments, 
while 
someone 

opened fire on my classmates? 
I considered my boyfriend, 
my parents, my siblings, my 
grandparents.

I thought back to all of the 

missed calls I’ve ever gotten 
from my mom, and how every 
time she had assumed the 
worst: that I had crashed my 
car, got lost on a road trip, 
didn’t make it back to my 
vehicle after a closing shift.

I wouldn’t want to worry 

her, I thought, in case I made 
it out okay. I wouldn’t want 
to call her, wouldn’t want 
to confirm her worst-case 
scenarios. And if I didn’t 
make it out ok, I thought, she 
would know I love her. Deeply 
and fiercely. She would know 

that. And it would be out of 
love that I didn’t call her, that 
I didn’t force her to listen 
to 
her 
terrified, 
19-year-

old daughter sobbing into 
the phone while gunshots 
and screams echo in the 
background. After all, no call 
would stop any bullets.

These shouldn’t be the 

thoughts that I have. I should 
be fretting over my history 
exam next week, or the fact 
that I have a pimple on my 
chin that for the life of me I 
can’t get to go away. I should 
be thinking college student 
things.

Yet it now seems that mass 

shootings are just another 
college 
student 
thing: 

history exam, pimple on my 
chin, escape plan in a mass 
shooting. It is a legitimate 
possibility for my life to be 
taken from me by the hands 
of a stranger with a gun, 
opening fire on my campus. It 
is a legitimate possibility that 
the same thing could happen 
to my younger siblings on 
their campuses.

And it doesn’t seem to be 

taken seriously. There are 
people who hold the power 
to make this the last school 
shooting in the history of the 
United States, and yet they are 
more persuaded by personal 
interests and greed than the 
lifeless bodies of more than 
1,829 civilians killed in mass 
shootings since Sandy Hook 
in 2012. Those with power in 
the U.S. have a responsibility 
to protect our people and they 
have the opportunity to do so. 
So why aren’t they taking it?

Today I thought

Why don’t Republicans pass conservative legislation?

HANK MINOR | COLUMN

Y

esterday, I found myself 
sitting at a café in 
downtown Ann Arbor 

engaged 
in 
a 
conversation 

about religion, gender roles and 
libertarianism.

To give a little more context, 

a few nights beforehand I was 
at a bar talking with a friend 
of mine, and at one point the 
topic of Judaism came up. 
We are both Jewish men, but 
it quickly became apparent 
that our relationships to our 
religion were quite different, 
and we decided to continue 
the 
conversation 
another 

day with clearer heads and a 
quieter environment.

Over the course of the 

conversation, we encountered 
some opinions we shared and 
many more we did not. We 
clashed over our beliefs in 
divinity and the importance of 
tradition, and the discussion 
even touched on the topic of 
reproductive rights. After our 
time together, I departed the 
café with a stronger conviction 
in some of my beliefs, newfound 
doubt in others and, most 
importantly, 
with 
a 
better 

understanding of my friend and 
his world, about which I now 
realize I knew little.

I bring up this anecdote 

because I believe experiences 
like these are some of the 
most 
important 
learning 

opportunities a person can 
encounter, 
and 
from 
my 

perspective, 
they 
are 
an 

increasingly rare phenomenon. 
Conflicting 
ideologies 
have 

always existed, and as we 
move deeper into what some 
are calling the post-truth era, 
even facts are up for debate. 
Yet, as people gain access to 
a greater diversity of thought 
during the age of information, 
I see both within the University 
of Michigan community and 
beyond a growing reluctance for 
many to expose themselves to 
ideas different from their own, 
let alone engage with them.

The reasons for this decline 

in discourse are unclear, but I 
have a few ideas. Perhaps the 
belief-affirming tendencies of 
social media are making our 
generation less aware of ideas 
that differ from our own, leading 
us to become less comfortable 
with and less open to ideas that 
contrast ours. Perhaps we are 

perceiving the presentation of 
ideas different from our own as 
attacks on not just our beliefs, 
but as attacks on ourselves and 
our character, leading to the end 
of a conversation before it can 
even begin. Or, perhaps we just 
feel so strongly about certain 
beliefs that we don’t feel there is 
any need to expose ourselves to 
others, because, of course, we’re 
always right.

Regardless of the reasoning, 

I believe this growing trend 
of homogeneous thought has 
the potential to be harmful to 
the growth of our generation 
and its potential to develop 
thoughtful, inclusive leaders. To 
be frank, there is no downside 
to engaging with differing and 
even 
difficult-to-understand 

ideas. 

If you engage with someone 

who feels drastically different 
than you about a certain subject 
and leave the conversation with 
the same stances you entered, 
I would consider the exchange 
well worth your time. Not only 
can you now walk away from the 
experience feeling even stronger 
in your convictions because they 
have withstood the scrutiny of 
the opposition, but perhaps you 
might have changed the mind of 
the individual on the other side 
of the aisle. 

If you engage with someone 

who 
holds 
a 
conflicting 

viewpoint to your own and find 
yourself doubting your beliefs 
or struggling to defend the ideas 
about which you previously 
felt so strongly, then this too 
is a beautiful thing. Change is 
difficult, but in the words of the 
former Roman Emperor and 
philosopher Marcus Aurelius, 
“If someone is able to show me 
that what I think or do is not 
right, I will happily change, for 
I seek the truth, by which no 
one was ever truly harmed. It is 
the person who continues in his 
self-deception and ignorance 
who is harmed.”

I would argue, though, that 

the greatest benefit of exposing 
oneself to uncomfortable and 
different ideas is gaining a 
better understanding of the 
world around you. Ignoring 
others and their beliefs won’t 
erase the potential influence 
they may have on your world. 
For example, dismissing and 
denouncing 
ideas 
of 
white 

supremacy 
didn’t 
keep 
the 

Charlottesville 
rally 
from 

materializing. Chalking off a 
celebrity 
businessman’s 
bid 

for a presidency as ridiculous 
and ignoring the voices of his 
previously 
disenfranchised 

supporters certainly didn’t put 
Hillary Clinton in office. But, 
engaging with individuals who 
hold different beliefs than you, 
understanding and empathizing 
with their positions and seeking 
to find solutions that work 
with—rather than in spite of—
the opposition may have been 
able to alter these narratives.

Certainly, there is a time 

and place for these dialogues. 
Individuals feel strongly about 
their beliefs for a reason and 
are certainly entitled to feel 
offended if feel they are being 
personally 
attacked. 
Being 

respectful 
and 
thoughtful, 

with an awareness that how 
you say something is often just 
as important as what you are 
saying, is key to the success of 
these conversations. There is 
a thin line between bringing 
up 
important, 
conflicting 

ideas in a discussion and being 
unnecessarily provocative to 
rile up those around you. I do 
not consider trolling someone or 
yelling ignorant hate speech at 
anyone to fall into the category 
of constructive dialogue.

Our world is comprised 

of 
more 
communities 
than 

one can count, varying from 
each other in manners, both 
large and small. None of these 
communities—even your own 
utopia—are perfect, and I firmly 
believe we all can learn from 
each other in some capacity. 
By 
entering 
into 
honest 

dialogues, acknowledging that 
our ways may not be perfect 
and explaining to others how 
their ideas may have room for 
growth, we can truly make the 
world a better place – or at least 
a more empathetic one. I urge 
anyone reading this to take a 
step outside of their comfort 
zone 
and 
to 
engage 
with 

someone on the other side of the 
aisle. No matter how wrong you 
initially might think they are, 
maybe, just maybe, you might 
like what you find.

FILM REVIEW

While Ryan Coogler’s “Black 
Panther” lies in the cinematic 
universe of the Avengers, it is a 
film self-contained by its own 
breathtaking 
world-building. 
Following the death of King 
T’Chaka (John Kani, “Captain 
America: Civil War”) in “Captain 
America: 
Civil 
War,” 
Prince 
T’Challa 
(Chadwick 
Boseman, 
“Marshall”) 
returns 
home 
to 
Wakanda to assume the throne and 
the responsibilities that come with 
it. With his return to Wakanda, 
T’Challa reveals a nation only 
hinted at in “Civil War.” With an 
ensemble cast of incredibly strong, 
compelling 
and 
fully-fleshed 
out characters, “Black Panther” 
showcases the vitality of leading 
actors of color and delivers a long-
overdue demonstration of diversity 
in major blockbuster franchises.
Nestled in the sweeping plains 
of West Africa, Wakanda is an awe-
inspiring civilization of stunning 
technological advancements and 
incredibly vibrant culture. The city 
sits atop a geological treasure trove 
of vibranium, the strongest and 
most valuable element in the MCU. 
The metal is woven into their 
clothes, powers their tech and is 
infused in their medicine. The 
inextricable cultural and scientific 
importance of vibranium to the 
nation of Wakanda justifies their 
isolation; to the rest of the world, 
Wakanda is a third-world pastoral 
country. To protect their way of 
life, the Wakandans have hidden 
themselves and their achievements 
behind a force field, choosing to 

remain the world’s most advanced 
society in secret. But with isolation 
comes complications, that the film 
works to expertly address and 
explore.
The fabric of Wakanda is 
teeming with bright, colorful 

vibrancy. The costume, hair and 
makeup design in “Black Panther” 
is 
almost 
overwhelmingly 
gorgeous — members of each of 
Wakanda’s five tribes are decorated 
in dazzling costumes that speak to 
the inventiveness and inspirations 
of the designers, who worked to 
pay homage to the aesthetics of 
African tribes in every thread. 
The headdresses, hair design and 
face makeup demonstrate the 
incredible attention to detail and 
precision made by the designers. 
Wakanda comes alive through the 
costumes, and there is a genuine 
sense of rich culture that pulses 
with every beat of the film. Even 
the graphic design of the title cards 
emphasizes the inspirations of 
African heritage in the film. 
Mythology also plays an integral 
role in “Black Panther.” Ritual and 
ceremony are a vital part of the 
coronation process; after asserting 
his right to the throne, T’Challa 
drinks an infusion made from 
herbs grown with vibranium and 
enters a mystical spirit realm, 
where he communicates with his 

father. The Black Panther suit also 
acts as a ceremonial right handed 
down through generations, giving 
power to each King throughout 
time. The way in which the film 
weaves the mythology of Wakanda 
and the spirituality of its people 
with 
political 
and 
scientific 
elements speaks again to the 
film’s incredible incorporation of 
African culture, and sets it apart 
as a superhero film with its own 
distinct sense of self. 
Chadwick 
Boseman 
as 
T’Challah, along with Daniel 
Kaluuya (“Get Out”) as his best 
friend 
W’Kabi 
and 
Winston 
Duke 
(“Person 
of 
Interest”) 
as the outlying chief M’Baku, 
deliver compelling and magnetic 
performances that demonstrate 
the strength and regality of men 
willing to fight for their country. 
But even more compelling are the 
women of this film, who capture 
each frame with a commanding 
and almost tangible sense of 
presence. Danai Gurira (“The 
Walking Dead”) plays Okoye, the 
General of the Wakandan army — 
a woman who is both physically 
powerful and strong in her sense 
of purpose and loyalty. Lupita 
Nyong’o (“Queen of Katwe”) is 
mesmerizing as a strong-willed 
and 
compassionate 
Wakandan 
warrior, 
and 
Angela 
Bassett 

With ‘Black Panther,’ MCU 
gets a needed burst of life

“Black Panther”

Walt Disney 
Studios

Rave, Quality 16, 
State Theater

On Dec. 28, 1998, the Japanese 
dream pop group Fishmans 
performed for the last time at 
Akasaka Blitz in Tokyo. For a 
little longer than two hours, the 
band played their biggest hits 
throughout their discography, as 
well as the entirety of their album 
Long Season. The performance 
is a stunning example of a 
band’s final goodbye, with every 
last second filled to the brim 
with rich detail and stunning 
performances.
I discovered 98.12.28 through 
the classic music lover’s past-
time 
of 
perusing 
through 
internet boards such as Rate 
Your Music. I usually greet 
albums like 98.12.28 — rather 
rare, foreign works with an 
unusually high level of acclaim 
on such internet boards — with 
skepticism. Quite often, such 
albums offer little uniqueness 
beyond a sense of mystery and 
allure.
98.12.28, on the other hand, 
is one of the most profoundly 
affecting live albums — scratch 
that, just albums — I have ever 
heard. It remains one of the few 
examples of a work that truly 
took me on an odyssey. Lead 
singer Shinji Sato has a uniquely 
androgynous voice that may be 
somewhat of an acquired taste, 
but on 98.12.28, he manages 
to extract every ounce of raw 
power and passion he can muster 
for the entire two-hour duration.
The album’s brilliance also lies 
in traversing such a wide variety 
of emotions. As someone who 
cannot understand the lyrics, the 
album nonetheless has the same 
effect as any great symphony or 
opera of being able to transmit 
feeling 
simply 
through 
the 
transitions 
and 
development 
of the music. The background 
chords of the album’s opener 
“Oh! Slime” are reminiscent 
of 
instrumentals 
on 
The 
Avalanche’s “Since I Left You,” 
carrying a pure, innocent sense 

of joy and uplift. As “Since I Left 
You” features a sunny sample of 
dialogue from the movie “Club-
Med” (“Have a drink have a good 
time now, welcome to paradise”), 
Sato starts the concert with a 
simple “Are you feel good?” Yet 
Fishmans is equally capable of 
exploring feelings of melancholy 
and loss.
Fishmans uses typical dream 
pop tropes such as heavily 
washed 
out 
guitars 
and 
a 
slow, almost sloppy manner of 
playing, but it shines due to the 
small details and interludes 
interspersed 
throughout 
the 
album. Moments such as the 
short violin interlude in “Oh! 
Slime” and a chorus of bells 
in “Long Season” add new 
dimensions to the music not 
present in the studio recordings. 
These short moments are where 
the band truly feels as if they 
are transcending the confines of 
their stage.
Sato’s constant banter with 
the audience, although obviously 
unintelligible to non-Japanese 
speakers, makes the album feel 
truly organic. This point is what 
made me realize why I enjoyed 
98.12.28 so much more than 
the band’s studio albums. It is 
the rare live album that starkly 
exceeds the impact of the group’s 
studio albums precisely because 
one gets the sense that the artists 
are pouring everything into the 
performance. The instrumentals 
aren’t 
perfect, 
Sato’s 
voice 
wavers and strains, but none of 
it matters because it all feels so 
real.w
Overall, 98.12.28 is a triumph. 
There is really just no other way 
to describe it. It is a masterful 
display of skill, ingenuity and 
passion, and to fully dissect its 
brilliance is nearly impossible. 
Shinji Sato died tragically of 
heart disease just three months 
after the performance, unable 
to see the monumental impact 
of his magnum opus on people 
around the world. But he can rest 
assured that few people have 
said goodbye in such a brilliant 
way.

DAILY WORLD MUSIC COLUMN
(“American 
Horror 
Story”) 
radiates regality and grace as 
the Queen Mother. T’Challa’s 
kid sister Shuri, played by Letitia 
Wright 
(“Black 
Mirror”), 
is 
single-handedly responsible for 
the entire technological operation 
of Wakanda, an amazing feat of 
feminist power that proves that 
women can do incredible things 
when given the space to. 
In classic Marvel fashion, 
“Black Panther” steps away 
from the traditional hero-villain 
binary, instead choosing to tackle 
more complex and weighted 
themes. Soon after becoming 
king, T’Challa is confronted 
by his past when his cousin, an 
American 
mercenary 
soldier 
born to King T’Chaka’s brother, 
returns to his native home of 
Wakanda to assert his blood right 
to the throne. This antagonist, 
Erik Killmonger (Michael B. 
Jordan, “Creed”), addresses the 
problematic aspects of Wakanda 
as a hidden but powerful nation. 
People of color around the world 
experience injustice, brutality 
and oppression, and Wakanda 
has the power to liberate them. 
Killmonger works to complicate 
the 
Atlantean 
fantasy 
of 
Wakanda by arguing for its active 
presence in global politics, and its 
responsibility to weaponize and 
liberate Black people everywhere. 
“Black 
Panther” 
reinforces 
Marvel’s brilliance as a franchise 
by showing an active infusion of 
real-world issues in a fantastical 
space. Killmonger advances the 
notion of a Black power fantasy 
by imagining a world where 
people of color upend the social 
hierarchy, while complicating 
the issue with his emphasis on 
bloodlust and violence.
“Black 
Panther” 
is 
a 
revolutionary, 
important 
and 
dynamic film that showcases 
a diverse ensemble cast of 
powerful Black actors and builds 
a world where African people 
have the technology and agency 
to determine world order. The 
movie balances an upbeat, playful 
tone with one that seriously 
examines the plight of oppressed 
people, focusing in on the Black 
experience in America. It is a 
breathtaking film that sings with 
vibrancy in every stroke, melding 
art forms and influences to 
create a world unlike anything 
seen before. It stands as one of 
Marvel’s strongest hero films, 
and one of the most inventive 
and thought-provoking pieces of 
cinema to ever be put on screen. 

NEW YORK FASHION WEEK REVIEW

Vivienne Hu A/W 
blends romance 
and practicality 

Vivienne Hu is a former 
investment banker. Her latest 
collection 
is 
tailor-made 
for the feminine millennial 
businesswoman. The clothes 
are both classic and decadent. 
The accessories are versatile. 
Every look is downright smart.
The 
New 
York-based 
designer looked to her Chinese 
heritage 
for 
her 
Autumn/
Winter 2018 show, presented 
at Spring Studios during New 
York Fashion Week. According 
to the brand’s public relations 
team, Vivienne Hu’s design 
team drew inspiration from 
the historic Mogao Caves of 
Gansu, 
whose 
decorations 
combine Central Asian, Indian 
and Chinese motifs. The caves’ 
influence 
appeared 
in 
the 
collection’s jewel-toned satins, 
textured tweeds and delicate 
floral prints.
In a strategic marketing 
maneuver, 
Hu’s 
dreamy 
tribute to her ancestry was 

juxtaposed against an array 
of 
modern 
details. 
Nearly 
every look included a faux 
fur stole or purse in a cheeky, 
eye-catching 
hue. 
Though 
presented in lesser quantities, 
mock-reptilian 
fanny 
packs 
and monogrammed knits are 
sure to become best sellers. 
The icing on the contemporary 
cake was the unveiling of a line 
of high-tech sneakers designed 
in collaboration with Chinese 
software developer Tencent 
Co.
All things considered, it’s 
no surprise that the crowd at 
Vivienne Hu was remarkably 
youthful. For once, I didn’t 
feel like the baby in the room 
(perhaps because there was an 
actual toddler in attendance). 
Rather, I was a poster child 
for the collection’s market: 
A 
career-oriented, 
socially-
conscious young woman who 
would still love to wear a frilly 
dress every once in awhile.
I don’t know the first thing 
about banking, but I do know 
Vivienne Hu was right to leave 
finance for fashion.

FREE SPEECH AND THE NECESSITY OF DISCOMFORT

“I 
don’t 
really 
know, 
actually,” said Aaron Maine, the 
mastermind 
behind 
Porches, 
taking a long, patient pause. “I 
don’t even know how to describe 
it in a lot of words,” he finished, 
after I asked him to describe 
The House, his third official 
full-length album and second 
for Domino Recording. It wasn’t 
quite the answer I expected, but 
it reveals the personal necessity 
of his art. If he could have said 
what he needed to say with The 
House any other way, he would 
have. There is no way for him to 
condense his truth any further.
Maine tours with the band, 
but it’s no secret that he’s the 
project’s 
creative 
force. 
He 
wrote every song on The House 
aside 
from 
“Understanding,” 
penned and performed by his 
father, Peter Maine. This track 
and several others reflect what 
seems to be a fresh branching 
out in Maine’s creative process. 
Dev Hynes of Blood Orange joins 
him on leading single “Country,” 
Alex Giannascoli of (Sandy) 
Alex G on “Leave the House” 
and his girlfriend Kaya Wilkins 
— who performs as Okay Kaya 
and recently appeared in the 
Norwegian supernatural horror-
thriller “Thelma” — on “Åkeren,” 
among others.
When I ask Maine how some 
of these collaborations came 
about, one story is more than I 
could’ve asked for. He and Alex 
G had been crossing paths for a 
time, being more or less in the 
same scene, before they went on 
a month-long tour in 2016.
“It was right when I got back 
from that that I invited him 
over to sing on the record and 
we ended up with (‘Leave The 
House’),” Maine said, and as 
for Wilkins: “I had been a fan, 
and wanted to have her voice 
on (the record), and we ended 
up with (‘Åkeren’).” Originally 
a poem by Maine, Wilkins 
translated the piece, whose title 
means “cornfield,” to her native 
Norwegian.
As for Blood Orange: “I’ve 
known Dev for maybe four years 
now,” Maine said. “We started 
hanging out playing ping pong 
at this spot called Fat Cat in the 
West Village.”
Speaking to Maine is much 
like listening to him sing. His 
words are measured, his speech 
economic. At first, I thought it 
was because he was annoyed or 
bored with my questions, but I 
quickly learned that it’s just who 
he is. Which is why his meeting 
Hynes over ping pong is even 
more humorously disarming — 
it’s hard to imagine him doing 
anything as quick as playing table 
tennis, where there isn’t time to 
be careful, to stop and think.
As we talk, it becomes only 
more and more evident that this 
intentionality lies at the core 
of every step Maine takes as an 
artist, from the first penning 
of 
lyrics 
to 
their 
eventual 

performance.
Part of this deliberateness 
might just be connected to 
Maine’s 
ostensible 
obsession 
with water (see: 2016 LP Pool, 
EP Water and The House’s “Now 
The 
Water,” 
“Country” 
and 
“Swimmer”).
“It’s a topic I honestly didn’t 
quite realize how often I was 
coming back to,” Maine said, 
following up with a theory he 
has devised. “When I sit down to 
write, one of the first things I try 
to do is give the setting. A lot of 
the time, water seems to be one of 
the best descriptors, whether it’s 
the temperature or the humidity 
or the precipitation or what 
you’re drinking.”
Here, water is a solution to 
a practical problem, but it’s 
more than just a tool to describe 
surroundings.
“It’s 
a 
spiritual 
thing, 
sometimes, to be submerged … 
you’re suspended in this thing 

and all the sound disappears and 
kind of reminds you that you’re 
small,” Maine added.
There’s something very fitting, 
too, about the ubiquity of water in 
Maine’s discography. “Humid” is 
a word to which I often return to 
describe his art, both musically 
and 
visually. 
Pool 
and 
The 
House are both masterclasses in 
balancing the nostalgic and the 
synthetic, perfect soundtracks 
for late summer nights. He’s 
branded his music “dark muscle,” 
which I think is likely a different 
way of saying the same thing. 
Hollow-sounding 
synths 
and 
percussion 
provide 
forward 
motion, while Maine’s voice 
soars above it all, syrupy and 
lackadaisical, but loaded with 
emotion and yearning.
“I do think that it has always 
been my tendency to write in a 
more economic way, even when 
I first started writing songs and, 
I think, I had less control over 
what came out … it is something 
that I’ve tried to embrace, or find 
myself inclined to keep coming 
back to,” Maine said. “I don’t 
know, just talking about things 
through 
seemingly 
mundane 
objects or subjects.”
He also notes that his writing 
style tends to partially mimic 
whatever author he happens to 
be reading at the time, or an artist 
who’s dominating his listening.
“I think for (Slow Dance in) 
the Cosmos I was reading a lot 
of Frank O’Hara poetry.” Then 
he laughs, “I don’t know if, 
you know, I’m not saying that 
it actually sounds like Frank 
O’Hara,” Maine finished, ever 
the humble artist.
While he was developing The 
House, he says he was really 
getting into Alex G’s catalog 
for the first time, and praises 
Giannascoli’s 
free-association, 
stream-of-consciousness style of 
writing.
“It’s like I can imagine him 
writing the whole thing in one 
swoop … the way he keeps the 
channel open is so effective and 
eerie and telling of what goes 
on in his head,” Maine told me. 
Listening to Giannascoli’s 2015 
breakout Beach Music partially 
inspired Maine to start keeping a 
more regular journal.
“Since then I’ve just been 
writing every day, kind of diary-
ish stuff, and then some of that 
will turn into poems or stories or 
songs.”
Later in our conversation, 
though, we touched on the 
difference, 
or 
lack 
thereof, 
between poetry and music.
“In terms of writing and the 
distinction between poetry and 
songs, I don’t … there’s not a line 
that I draw necessarily though 
I release music so that’s kind of 
where the poems go.”
But not all of his poems evolve 
into songs, and even the ones 
that do are edited, cut down to 
fit the track’s melodic structure. 
So what happens to the lyrics we 
never hear?
“I have been collecting the 
stuff that doesn’t make it into the 
songs … and I am really interested 

in putting out some sort of thing 
that resembles poetry at some 
point,” Maine answered. “I have 
a hard time even calling it that, 
because I know it’s such a thing 
of its own. I would hesitate to call 
myself a poet but I would like to 
put these things out to be read by 
whoever’s interested.”
Earlier, Maine said that one 
of the first things he does when 
writing is try to give the setting. 
Another go-to writing strategy 
lies 
in 
creating 
characters, 
alter egos, for himself. On The 
House, you’ll hear more than 
one mention of his latest, Ricky 
(Pepsi) and his partner, Julie. 
Maine 
has 
also 
previously 
donned the name Ronnie or 
Ronald Paris and, though the 
names in and of themselves don’t 
seem to bear significance, they 
do help him to click into the right 
mindset.
“I think that each ego or 
character, for me, represents the 
current version of myself that 
feels like it needs a distinction 
from the rest,” he said.
He also noted his appreciation 
for the artistic space afforded by 
having “a clean slate as (each) 
new character,” and though he 
doesn’t necessarily attempt to 
assume those characters onstage, 
“if it’s feeling good, I do feel very 
transported.”
“It doesn’t happen with all the 
songs, and it doesn’t happen all 
the time, but there are certain 
moments where I really am 
brought back to a certain memory 
surrounding the song. And that 
feels good,” he said.
These moments are when 
he believes he performs best, 
though this doesn’t mean that 
his best performances all look 
alike. One night he might feel like 
“crawling around on the floor or 
going into the audience or laying 
down,” while another he feels 
“very serious and very still, or 
severe, and will just sort of stand 
still and perform the songs.”
He reassured me that he 
doesn’t need to move onstage to 
be moved internally. For him, it’s 
all about embracing whatever he 
may be feeling that particular 
evening.
“Maybe they’d prefer it if I put 
on a wacky show every night, but 
I don’t think it would feel sincere 
if I did that, if I wasn’t feeling it,” 
he said, after tipping his hand as 
some kind of idealist: “I think 
that’s what people ultimately 
want is” — he pauses here to 
laugh at himself — “the truth, 
from you, I guess … maybe not all 
the time.”
Looking 
forward, 
Maine 
expressed excitement for the next 
Blood Orange record, apparently 
in the works, as well as the 
upcoming Empress Of. He was 
also anticipating his own tour, 
which began on Feb. 15th, two 
weeks after our conversation.
“We’ve been rehearsing a 
lot the past two weeks, and it’s 
finally gelling in a really special 
way, so that feels good and 
exciting,” Maine said, though he 
won’t romanticize life on tour: “I 
am not looking forward to being 
away from the people that I love 
for like four, five months out 
of the year … just trying to stay 
centered about it and put on as 
good a show as we possibly can, 
and have it feel good for everyone 
involved, on our side and on the 
audience side.”
We can be sure to hear much 
of The House, likely several cuts 
off of Pool and, if we’re lucky, 
one or two from Slow Dance. If 
the stars align, we may even get 
to hear a cover or two, as Porches 
performed The Beatles’s “If I 
Fell” for SiriusXMU in mid-Jan.
“I picked that song because it’s 
so fucking savage, the line about 
like ‘and she will cry when she 
learns we are two,’” Maine said, 
betraying his more humorous 
side. When I ask if he might 
play the song on tour, he replies 
with a pensive “maybe,” but also 
offhandedly 
mentions 
Alicia 
Keys, The Strokes and, most 
interestingly, that his manager 
has been recommending Drake’s 
“Passionfruit.” Covers or not, 
though, Maine is a performer 
worth lending an ear to — his 
unpredictability 
and 
true 
commitment to his art makes 
him one of the most exciting acts 
in the scene today, both onstage 
and off.

Poole’s hot shooting helps 

Michigan pull away from OSU

Jordan 
Poole 
has 

had big performances 
before.

The freshman guard 

scored 
19 
against 

Indiana, and he had 11 
in East Lansing.

Sunday 
afternoon 

was 
a 
bit 
different 

though. It was Senior 
Day, 
Crisler 
Center 

was 
sold 
out 
and 

the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team hosted 
No. 8 Ohio State — the 
team 
who 
beat 
the 

Wolverines via a huge 
comeback in December 
— in a vital game in 
the homestretch of the 
season.

And 
Poole 
showed 

up on the biggest stage 
of his young career, 
helping the team to a 
74-62 win.

The Wolverines (11-5 

Big Ten, 22-7 overall) 
led the Buckeyes (13-3, 
22-7) a majority of the 
game, but the lead felt 
fragile. So with 6:25 
left and the Wolverines 
hanging on to a five-
point lead, insurance 
points felt necessary.

That’s when senior 

guard 
Muhammad-

Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 

drove into the lane 
and 
kicked 
out 
to 

Poole 
in 
the 
right 

corner. The freshman 
collected himself, rose 
up and buried it before 
running 
back 
on 

defense with his arms 
in the air, taking in the 
scene around him.

Three 
minutes 

after 
Poole’s 
shot, 

Abdur-Rahkman 
hit 

an open three of his 
own to make it 65-53 
to essentially put the 
game away.

It 
was 
a 
winning 

combination 
for 

Michigan 
all 
night. 

Poole, with his electric 
personality and f lashy 
style of play, hit big 
threes and urged the 
crowd to get excited. 
Abdur-Rahkman, with 
his calm, workmanlike 
demeanor, 
made 
the 

plays the Wolverines 

needed to win. The 
pair led the team in 
scoring. Poole finished 
with 15 points, and 
Abdur-Rahkman 
had 

17.

From 
there, 

Michigan simply iced 
the game away, 74-62.

“When they cut it 

to four and had a foul 
shot, and I think they 
cut it to three, we 
made just about every 
good play down the 
stretch to get the ‘W,’ 
” said John Beilein. … 
“I was really proud of 
the way we battled the 
whole time.”

The first half was a 

back-and-forth affair.

Poole 
dazzled 
for 

Michigan in that half 
too. 
With 
6:05 
left 

before 
halftime, 
he 

drove right on Ohio 
State 
guard 
Kam 

Williams, stopped on 
a dime, stepped back 
to create space and 
drilled 
a 
3-pointer 

over 
Williams, 
who 

fouled Poole in the 
process.

The play exhibited 

the 
raw 
skill 
Poole 

possesses 
and 
also 

the spark he gave the 
Wolverines, as he led 
all scorers with 12 of 
his 15 points coming in 
the first 20 minutes.

“The first (shot) felt 

great,” 
Poole 
said. 

“So I was just, kinda, 
liking my shot a little 
bit. I had confidence 
once 
they 
started 

dropping.”

On the other end, the 

Buckeyes worked more 
methodically. Forward 
Jae’Sean Tate nearly 
had 
a 
double-double 

in the first half alone, 
accruing eight points 
and eight rebounds. All 
the action ultimately 

led to a 5-point 
Michigan lead at 
halftime.

The 
second 

half 
began 

similarly. Ohio 
State 
f lexed 

its muscles on 
the inside, but 
the Wolverines 
stayed ahead.

That’s 
how 

it 
was 
when 

Poole 
toed 

the 
3-point 

line 
in 
the 

right 
corner, 

sending 
Crisler Center 
into hysterics 
and Michigan 
to 
its 
22nd 

win 
of 
the 

season.

“The 
first 

game had me 
and everybody 
else 
on 
the 

team sick, only 
because 
we 

were up by 20,” 
Poole said. “And 
then, we just knew 
we had to get this 
one. It was more 
of a, ‘We’ve got to 
get revenge game,’ 
instead of it being a 
top-20 team and a 
top-10 team.

“… We feel we’re 

better than them, 
especially 
with 

the performance 
we 
put 
on 
at 

Ohio 
State. 
We just 
feel 
we 

had to get 
that win.”

A basketball game was played 

Sunday. Some guys shot baskets 
— some went in, others didn’t. 
The team wearing maize jerseys 
scored more points than the guys 
donning scarlet and left Crisler 
Center significantly more pleased.

But for Austin Hatch and 

John Beilein, Sunday — Senior 
Day — was about so much more 
than 
basketball. 
Sunday 
was 

emblematic of the true meaning 
of sports, a foundation that 
supersedes a few baskets here 
and there, a few wins, a few 
championships. 
The 
story 
of 

Austin Hatch is a story about the 
impact sports can have in their 
purest form.

And when Hatch walked on 

the court to a roaring ovation 
with his grandparents and fiance, 
former Michigan volleyball player 
Abby Cole, on his side, the impact 
was clear. After all that he’s been 
through, it was the end of one 
era for Hatch, and the start of a 
blindingly bright next.

“Life’s 
good 
man,” 
Hatch 

told a group of reporters Friday 
afternoon. “It’s coming together.”

By now, you probably know the 

story of Austin Hatch. It has been 
well-documented, and for good 
reason.

It’s a story of remarkable 

tragedy, of unthinkable sadness. 

But Sunday was a reminder that 
it’s also a story of unparalleled 
perseverance. It’s a love story 
between 
a 
young 
man 
and 

a 
university, 
a 
player-coach 

relationship 
that 
reaches 
far 

beyond the bounds of basketball.

When he was eight years old, 

Hatch was involved in a plane 
crash that killed his mother, 
brother and sister. Hatch, seated 
in the front passenger seat, 
survived alongside his father, who 
was piloting the plane. When he 

was a sophomore in Fort Wayne, 
Ind. Beilein offered Hatch — a 
promising scorer and knockdown 
shooter — a scholarship to play for 
the Wolverines. Eight days later, 
he was in another plane crash, this 
time killing his father and family 
dog. Hatch was left in a coma for 
eight weeks, having to regain the 
ability to walk and speak. Still, 
Beilein honored his scholarship 
offer, and Hatch enrolled his 
freshman year.

“The ultimate measure of a 

coach — obviously a good coach 
wins basketball games, you can 
see the results that way and the 
impact he has on his team — but the 
impact he has on developing his 
players, these young men,” Hatch 
said. “I’ve definitely learned a lot, 
grown as a young man. I definitely 
will take the lessons I’ve learned 
from him with me the rest of my 
life, in my marriage, with my 
family and working. It’s a special 
bond, and it’s definitely not going 
to end in April.”

Saturday, four years after first 

enrolling at Michigan, 15 years 
after the first plane crash, seven 
years after the second, Hatch 
was honored on Senior Day. He 
was announced with the starters, 
embracing 
each 

player 
as 
they 

lined 
up 
for 

introductions. As 
he 
approached 

freshman 
guard 

Jordan 
Poole, 

Poole gave him 
a hug. After he 
was honored at 
midcourt, 
the 

players 
mobbed 

him lovingly.

Beilein told his players Hatch’s 

story before the game one more 
time. For freshmen like Poole, the 
details of Hatch’s experience were 
fresh.

“Just told them, ‘I want you to 

put yourself as an eight-year-old,” 
Beilein said, fighting back tears. 
“I want you to put yourself as one 
of the best sixteen-year-olds in 
the country, and lose your mom 

and dad after you already lost 
your brother and your sister and 
your mom — you watched them 
basically die.’ ”

Hatch finished his career with 

one point — a free throw he made 
in December 2014 against Coppin 
State. But the impact he had on his 
teammates can’t be measured.

“I try not to think about it too 

much because it’s sad, everything 
he’s been through,” said senior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman. “How positive he is is 
truly inspiring. That’s all you can 
ask for.”

In two months, Hatch will 

graduate 
with 
a 
degree 
in 

Organizational 
Studies. 
Soon 

after, he will get married to Cole. 
In July, he will be going to work 
full time in real estate acquisition 
at Domino’s.

“It’s crazy,” Hatch said. “Life’s 

happening, you know?”

And for Beilein, the day was a 

way to reflect. Reflect on where 
this relationship started. Reflect 
on where it’s come. Reflect on 
what Hatch means to him. Reflect 
on life.

“I was ready to cry. Somehow, 

I choked it off, but I was ready to 
cry,” Beilein said on seeing Hatch 
walk out of the tunnel Sunday. 
“When the NCAA allowed me to 
go see him when he was finally 
out of the coma, and see — the last 

time I saw him 
he was one of the 
best sophomores 
in 
the 
country, 

without question. 
He reminded me 
of a young Wally 
Sczerbiak. 
He 

was tremendous. 
He’d just played 
a great team and 
dominated them. 
Now I see him 

and doesn’t weigh 210 now, now he 
weighs about 140. He can’t eat the 
sandwich because — he can hardly 
walk — he can move like six inches 
at a time when he walks. And when 
you see that and then you see this 
and his family and his fiance Abby, 
it makes your heart warm. 

“If we’ve been a small part of 

his life, he’s been a huge part of my 
life and this team’s life.”

An unconventional senior class

T

here are certain occasions 
that all athletes look for-
ward to in their careers. 

Senior Day is 
near the top 
of the list.

The celebra-

tory affair — fit 
with framed 
jerseys, card-
board cutouts 
and individual 
plaudits — 
represents the 
exclamation 
mark at the end of a long chapter. 

But in a sport known for its one-

and-done culture, it can be a rare 
experience to be a senior in college 
basketball.

Even for Michigan, a top-tier 

program that isn’t often associ-
ated with lottery picks, only one of 
its past six first-round NBA Draft 
picks played a senior year as a Wol-
verine. And if it weren’t for a string 
of injuries, now-Brooklyn Nets 
forward Caris LeVert likely would 
have left early as well.

That’s why Michigan coach John 

Beilein makes sure that Senior Day 
is memorable for those who reach 
it.

“What’s sad is they think this 

goes on forever, and I know that 
some of the guys I’ve seen only once 
since then and that’s it,” he said. 
“The rest of their lives, the next 80 
years of their lives, you may only 
see them one time. So it’s really 
important that we embrace one of 
these last opportunities to play a 
home game.”

More often than not, the play-

ers that stay for four years aren’t 
the stars. They don’t come into the 
program as highly-touted recruits 
expected to make a flashy entrance 
and then a speedy exit. They are the 
players who work day in and day 
out to lay the building blocks for the 
foundation of the program.

That is especially true of 

Beilein’s senior class this season, 
even if theirs are more unconven-
tional stories.

An underrated starter, a reliable 

sixth man, a graduate transfer and 
a living miracle made up the four-
player contingent honored Sunday 
in front of a sold-out crowd at 
Crisler Center as No. 22 Michigan 
earned a 74-62 win over No. 8 Ohio 
State.

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rah-

kman, Duncan Robinson, Jaaron 
Simmons and Austin Hatch didn’t 
come in together four years ago, but 
they all have left their mark in Ann 
Arbor.

In 2014-15, it was Hatch who 

made his mark. He had to reclas-
sify after surviving a plane crash 
that took the lives of his father and 
stepmother and ultimately cut his 
playing career short. Once one of 
the best high school sophomores in 
the nation — having just received a 
scholarship offer from Beilein — he 
could only play in five collegiate 
games, but he served as a source of 
inspiration for the team.

In 2015-16, it was Robinson, who 

became the first player in NCAA 
history to receive a scholarship 
after transferring from Division III 
to Division I. He became a regular 
starter as a redshirt sophomore and 
ranked second in the Big Ten and 
ninth in the nation as a 45-percent 
3-point shooter.

In 2016-17, it was Abdur-

Rahkman, who turned his quiet 
beginnings as a two-star recruit 
into a starring role as a starter. He 
played a pivotal role in the Big Ten 
Tournament title run last March, 
averaging nine points and four 
rebounds per game in those four 
games, including a season-high 17 
points in the first contest.

In 2017-18, it has been Simmons, 

who joined the Wolverines for one 
final year after transferring from 
Ohio University. While he hasn’t 
become the regular contributor he 
was expected to be, he has pushed 
sophomore guard Zavier Simpson 
into becoming a well-rounded 

starter after the departure of now-
Miami Heat guard Derrick Walton 
Jr.

Each of the four, as players and 

as people, beat the odds and turned 
themselves into invaluable pieces 
of Michigan. In a season that had 
the potential to be a rebuilding year 
after the loss of five seniors and an 
NBA draft pick, these four have 
helped lead the Wolverines to an 
11-5 Big Ten and 22-7 overall record. 
After knocking off the Buckeyes, 
there seems to be much left in store 
for Michigan this season.

The same can’t be said for these 

seniors, whose playing careers 
are expected to end whenever the 
Wolverines’ season does. Though 
none of them are expected to make 
the jump to the next level, Beilein 
doesn’t see anything wrong with 
that. He used Abdur-Rahkman to 
illustrate his point. 

“You see this in college bas-

ketball all the time. The guy who 

comes in and gets who he is and 
isn’t about, ‘Get me to the pros’ and 
all these things,” he said. “He’s just 
about, ‘Coach, make me better. I’m 
gonna give you everything I have 
every minute. I’m not gonna be a 
holler guy, but I still love the team 
and my teammates.’ ”

He may have been directly 

referring to Abdur-Rahkman, but 
the description is apt for all four. 
Sunday, each of the seniors had his 
tip-of-the-cap moment.

Hatch, who has served as a stu-

dent assistant since taking a medi-
cal scholarship in 2015, dressed for 
the game and warmed up with his 
teammates. Though he couldn’t 
play due to NCAA rule, Beilein pro-
vided a nice touch by announcing 
him along with the starting five.

Simmons pushed Michigan out 

to a nine-point lead — its largest 
of the game midway through the 
second half — finishing a fast-break 
layup to rousing applause.

Abdur-Rahkman nailed a three-

pointer with just three minutes 
remaining to open up a 65-53 lead, 
strutting backward with the look of 
a man who had sealed victory.

Robinson finished it off with 1:16 

left on the clock, drawing an offen-
sive foul to top off his impressive 
defensive display against Ohio State 
forward Keita Bates-Diop, the Big 
Ten’s leading scorer. As the whistle 
blew, Robinson let out a roar 
toward the crowd. It had ‘game 
over’ written all over it.

They already had their framed 

jerseys from the pregame ceremo-
ny. They had just earned the rivalry 
win. But they had one last piece 
of business to attend to after the 
game. The four seniors — upon the 
beckoning of Beilein, who called 
them “four of the greatest young 
men we’ve ever had” — took the 
microphone to address the crowd.

Hatch acknowledged that he 

“wouldn’t change anything about 
my four years here.” Simmons said 
“it’s been a great ride.” Robinson 
called it “one of the best decisions 
I’ve ever made in my life.” And 
Abdur-Rahkman considered him-
self “lucky to wear Michigan across 
my chest.”

The consistent message from all 

four was captured best by Abdur-
Rahkman as he claimed that the 
Wolverines are “not done yet.”

The declaration comes with a 

caveat, though, as whatever comes 
next for Michigan will happen 
away from Crisler Center. That’s 
why, when Beilein asked him to 
lead the arena in “The Victors,” 
Abdur-Rahkman asked if the team 
could sing it with the Maize Rage.

So they walked into the student 

section and sang the fight song after 
the final home game of their Wol-
verine careers. 

It was an unconventional move, 

to be sure. But with this senior 
class, it couldn’t have been any 
other way.

‘M’ uses physicality to top Buckeyes

After Ohio State’s Keita Bates-

Diop clinked a 3-pointer off the 
front iron, it was a mad dash to 
grab the basketball.

Sophomore point guard Zavier 

Simpson had the quickest step 
and promptly lofted the ball 
to Moritz Wagner. The junior 
forward had no one in front of 
him as he sauntered to the hoop 
for the easy layup, but not before 
getting fouled by CJ Jackson for 
an and-one.

In classic Wagner fashion, he 

celebrated — flexing his muscles to 
the fans along the south baseline. 
For a team that typically makes 
its money on offense with long 
jumpers and shifty layups, it 
was an unusual flaunting of the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
hard-nosed play.

But 
in 
Sunday 
afternoon’s 

74-62 
victory 

over No. 8 Ohio 
State, 
Wagner’s 

flex 
symbolized 

exactly 
how 

the 
Wolverines 

earned 
their 

second 
top-ten 

win this season: A 
previously unseen 
physicality.

“Give Michigan 

credit,” said Ohio 
State coach Chris Holtmann. “I 
thought they played really physical 
today. They played well, putting us 
in difficult positions.”

On multiple occasions the two 

teams bumped elbows. They 
tangled in a number of loose-
ball scrambles, even getting into 
shoving matches after jump ball 
calls. On one loose ball in the 
first half, Wagner emerged from 
the dogpile, beating his chest 
and chanting at the crowd to 
rile them up, even for a routine 
deadball play that gave the ball 
to the Buckeyes. The significance 
of Senior Day and a rivalry were 
clearly not lost upon Michigan, 
and that lit a fire for the team, 
according to Simpson.

Simpson has been the sole 

constant in having a physical, 
swarming 
presence, 
and 
his 

teammates have called him a 
“pitbull” because of it. Sunday 
was no exception. In Simpson’s 
30 minutes, he limited Buckeye 
point guards Jackson and Andrew 
Dakich to three combined points, 

and 
exposed 

them 
for 
13 

points 
of 
his 

own.

“I 
feel 
like 

I’m the middle 
linebacker 
of 

the 
defense,” 

Simpson 
said, 

“just 
playing 

hard 
defense 

because 
my 

energy 
is 

contagious. Once they see me 
doing it, then they’ll start doing it.

“We 
definitely 
played 

aggressive which is good, and 
we’re proud of that.”

Duncan 
Robinson’s 
name 

hardly comes up in the discussion 
of stifling defenders. He is more 
commonly 
characterized 
as 

Simpson’s antithesis than his 
counterpart. 
But 
on 
Sunday, 

the fifth-year senior silenced 
critics with one of his best 
defensive performances of the 
year, combining with freshman 
forward Isaiah Livers to limit the 
Big Ten’s leading scorer in Bates-
Diop to a 5-for-17 performance. 
The stingy defense comes just 
four days after Robinson stymied 

Iowa’s Tyler Cook to just 10 points.

“You take a guy like Duncan 

Robinson and you go, ‘Oh, it’s 
senior night, he’s gonna hit some 
threes,’ ” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “No, he should be known 
for the job he did on (Bates-Diop). 
He was absolutely terrific. He and 
Isaiah Livers just — Did they shut 
him down? No, but it changed the 
momentum of the game when they 
took the top scorer in the league 
and marginalized him a little bit. 
It was just a great effort by him.”

While Robinson and Simpson 

were the standouts, the intensity 
coursed throughout the lineup. 
The newfound defensive identity 
was emblematic of philosophy 
change for Beilein — a one-on-
one battle mentality that puts the 
glamourous aspects of basketball 
to the wayside.

“You get down to it, they realize 

all the pretty plays or all the 
3-point shooting, it doesn’t win 
games, that you’ve gotta be able 
to really defend,” Beilein said. “In 
my earlier coaching career I was 
more into technique and scheme. 
… When you’ve got a guy, it’s a 
personal battle. Who’s gonna win? 
I think we’ve taken that on.”

Beilein claims his team needed 

a little “magic in a bottle” to 
complete the aggressive win. But 
it also may just be a thinly-veiled 
characterization of the typical 
Beilein team — the Wolverines are 
in a nice groove at the right time, 
and they sure look hungry for 
more.

The long week ahead

W

hen Nicole Munger 
nailed a 3-pointer to 
put Michigan up by 

nine near the 
midway point 
of the third 
quarter last 
Wednesday 
at Minnesota, 
the collective 
stress of the 
program 
seemed to be 
dissolving.

A win over 

the Golden 
Gophers would have broken a 
stretch of three losses in four 
games — all of them games the 
Wolverines were supposed to 
win. A win would have assured, 
once and for all, that the No. 23 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team would be in the NCAA 
Tournament, no doubt about 
it. A win would have gotten the 
Wolverines out of their funk 
just in time for a contest against 
Maryland — the tenth-ranked 
team in the country — and the 
Big Ten Tournament.

Instead, over the next four 

minutes, a nine-point lead 
turned into a one-point deficit.

Michigan played tug of war 

with Minnesota over the ensuing 
minutes, then fell to the ground 
as the Golden Gophers pulled the 
rope away.

That night, the team’s flight 

got cancelled due to fog and 
bad visibility. The next day, the 
Wolverines managed to get off 

the ground, then were diverted 
to Cincinnati. There, they sat 
for three hours with nothing to 
do but think, before mercifully 
being given the go-ahead to 
come back home.

“It’s super-frustrating and 

I think, you know, we’ve been 
trying to stay really positive,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico told WTKA on Wednesday. 
“Because of, you know, where we 
are — like, we talked about, we’re 
a little tired. We’re the only team 
that really hasn’t had the bye 
going into the stretch and I think 
that schedule has been a little bit 
tougher than anyone else’s.”

If a lack of rest has been the 

issue before, it won’t be now. 
The Wolverines don’t play again 
until Thursday, their last regular 
season game before another 
week-long break leading into the 
Big Ten Tournament. That might 
be enough time for freshman 
forward Hailey Brown to recover 
from the leg injury that kept her 
out Wednesday. It will certainly 
be enough time for the rest of the 
team to recover physically and 
do some reflecting.

Michigan is facing its own 

basketball mortality — a battle 
it lost last season and seems to 
be losing now. Thanks to the 
relative strength of the Big Ten 
and a resume-boosting win at 
Ohio State, the Wolverines will 
still probably make the NCAA 
Tournament. Probably, of course, 
being the operative word.

It’s never good to be falling 

back on the strength of a league 
to explain why one team from 
said league deserves to make it. 
It’s never good to be throwing 
around qualifiers like “probably” 
when discussing what, just two 
weeks ago, was a certainty. It’s 
never good to be talking about 
how the schedule is harder for 
you than anybody else in the 
same league, all of the teams 
in which have to play the same 
number of games in the same 
number of days.

Then again, it’s never good to 

have lost four of five when you 
have a number next to your name 
and the other team doesn’t.

Michigan is in the type of 

spot that defines careers — and 
defines a program. And it has all 
the time in the world to think 
about what happens next.

Beating the Terrapins isn’t 

everything — the Wolverines 
would probably (there’s that 
word again) be fine if they lost, 
provided they won their first Big 
Ten Tournament game. Even 
if they lose them both, ESPN 
Bracketologist Charlie Creme 
told the Detroit News last week 
that it would take blowout losses 
to endanger their spot.

Of course, his opinion is just 

that — an opinion — and though 
it’s certainly a well-informed 
opinion, that doesn’t mean the 
selection committee will agree. 
It’s just another way of saying 
probably.

Winning a game isn’t an 

unreasonable ask. Michigan will 
have at least two chances to do 
so; one of them will be against an 
inferior team.

But the Wolverines, mind 

you, were near the top-10 just 
a couple weeks ago. Given 
the talent on the roster, they 
shouldn’t be happy with just 
making the first round of the 
Tournament, even if that’s how 
they’ll be judged.

Right now though, eliminating 

the word “probably” should 
be Michigan’s only goal. It has 
all week to figure out how to 
accomplish it.

The only ones that matter

It didn’t matter that Michigan 

could only score one run all 
game.

It didn’t matter that Florida 

State had two runners in scoring 
position in the bottom of the 
seventh in a one-run game.

It didn’t matter that with a 

full count, and two outs, a single 
mistake could make or break the 
game.

For the No. 20 Michigan 

softball team (5-4), it was all 
about one pitch — the one being 
thrown.

“I thought that in the game 

last night, we were really one-
pitch focused,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “That’s 
how we were just caught in 
our moment. One pitch — 
that usually equates to good 
softball.”

Good 
softball 
would 
be 

an 
understatement 
for 
the 

Wolverines’ 
selfless 
defense. 

After shutting out Notre Dame 
(6-3) earlier Saturday, the team 
recorded its second shutout of 
the day with the 1-0 win against 
the eighth-ranked Seminoles 
(8-1).

In 
order 
to 
protect 
the 

slimmest 
of 
leads, 
the 

performances of the defense 
showed grit and determination 
that allowed Michigan to make 
its only run the winning run 
— an RBI single by senior first 
baseman Tera Blanco.

However, 
the 
remaining 

innings turned into fruitless 
attempts 
to 
add 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ 
lead, 
causing 

them to fall back on their only 
constants of the weekend trip: 
pitching and infield play.

Pitching in her fourth career 

start, 
freshman 
left-hander 

Meghan Beaubien had a perfect 
game heading into the seventh 
inning with seven strikeouts.

However, her hitless night 

came to an end quickly, as 
Seminole third baseman Jessica 
Warren hit a ball down the 

middle, narrowly escaping the 
grasp of freshman shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez, who dove 
up into the air for a chance at 
the fly ball. The tip of her glove 
brushed the ball, which pushed 
it further from the clutches of 
pursuing outfielders. However, 
the 
defense 
regrouped 
to 

prevent any extra bases.

With a groundout to second 

base, 
Beaubien 
put 
Florida 

State on its last legs. Facing the 
highest leverage situation of 
her college career, she allowed 
another single before a wild 
pitch pushed the two runners to 
second and third base with two 
outs.

As 
Seminole 
designated 

hitter Zoe Casas walked up to 
the plate to bat, Beaubien found 
herself in a familiar situation. 
In her first inning pitched for 
Michigan — the seventh inning 
of the season opener against 
Alabama-Birmingham, a 7-0 
win — she encountered multiple 
runners in scoring position, two 
outs and mounting pressure. 
However, this time, there was 
no seven-point cushion to act 
as a safety net in case of her 
mistakes — instead a measly 
one-run lead.

Yet, Beaubien took it one 

pitch at a time.

Four pitches, two balls, two 

strikes.

On the fifth pitch, she raised a 

look of triumph on her face, only 
to be shocked at the call of a ball 
— loading the count.

With the potential make-

or-break 
pitch 
determining 

whether the Seminoles would 
have one more go at bat, 
Beaubien saw the pitch at hand 
as she saw any other pitch.

“You have to always be one-

pitch focused,” Hutchins said. 
“That’s all we ask for, just be 
in your moment. So she’s a 
very talented pitcher. But you 
still have to just stay in your 
moment … You have to just go 
out there and work hard to do 
your part.

“That’s all we want from 

Meghan. 
That’ll 
make 
her 

great.”

Now with her back against 

the wall, Beaubien did what 
she’s always known — pitch.

Throwing a rising change-

up, she baited Casas to swing, 
sealing the game on a strikeout.

Running 
to 
the 
mound 

brimming 
with 
joy, 
the 

Wolverines didn’t care that they 
were forced to make a full-count 
pitch or could only score one run 
from the first play of the game. 
They cared that the run and 
pitch that came were the only 
ones that mattered.

Quick starts power Wolverines to sweep of Fighting Irish

Michigan sweeps No. 1 Notre Dame with 1-0 win

If Friday night’s pregame 

theatrics at Compton Family 
Ice 
Arena 
counted 
for 

anything, Notre Dame would 
have been up a goal before the 
puck even dropped.

The Fighting Irish’s home 

venue is the smallest in the 
Big Ten, but what it lacks in 
size, it more than makes up 
for in noise and intimidation. 
Its 5,022 seats are densely 
and 
intimately 
clustered 

around the rink, while its low-
hanging, barrel-vaulted roof 
allows for deafening acoustics.

On a “Whiteout” night in 

South Bend, these attributes 
were fully on display. Jim 
Cornelison, 
renowned 
for 

his performances at Chicago 
Blackhawks 
home 
games, 

delivered 
a 
thunderous 

rendition 
of 

“The 
Star 

Spangled 
Banner,” 
setting 
the 

sellout crowd 
ablaze. 
As 

the 
seconds 

counted 
down 
until 

the 
initial 

faceoff, 
a 

giant 
blue 

Notre 
Dame 

flag emerged from the raucous 
student 
section 
situated 

directly behind the Michigan 
net, as the Dropkick Murphys’ 
“I’m Shipping Up To Boston” 
boomed from the loudspeakers, 
threatening to blow over 5,000 
sets of eardrums out.

Long 
story 
short: 
Notre 

Dame isn’t an easy place to 
play if you’re a visiting team. It 
doesn’t help that the Fighting 
Irish are quite good at hockey.

So 
of 
course, 
Michigan 

won the opening faceoff and 
proceeded 
to 
pummel 
the 

nation’s No. 1 team for the next 
20 minutes.

“That 
was 
maybe 
our 

best 
period 
of 
the 
year,” 

said Wolverines coach Mel 
Pearson. 
“We 
were 
dialed 

in, the guys did a great job 
showing up to play.”

And did they ever show 

up. Michigan took 17 shots in 
the first period. Notre Dame 
had just six. The Wolverines 
got to seemingly every loose 
puck 
and 
constantly 
put 

themselves in dangerous 
positions, 
while 
the 

Fighting Irish’s 

attacking 
efforts 
were 
sparse 
and 
mostly 

disjointed.

With 

an 
NCAA 

Tournament 
bid 
very 

possibly 
on 

the line this 
weekend, 
Michigan 
could 
have 

imploded 
under 
the 

intensity 
of 
the 

environment 

or the quality of its opponent. 
Instead, according to Pearson, 
the Wolverines took advantage 
of their situation, feeding off 
the arena’s energy.

“Without a doubt that’s 

the best building other than 
Yost that I’ve been in this 
year,” Pearson said Friday. “I 
mean, if that doesn’t give you 
goosebumps, if that doesn’t 
excite you and get you ready 
for the game, I don’t know 
what will. … That’s a great 

atmosphere, 
that’s 
college 

hockey and good for Notre 
Dame. You love to play in 
those environments, I know 
our guys did.”

That 

was 

apparent 
as 

freshman 
forward 
Dakota 
Raabe 
streaked 
down 
the 

right 
flank 

and 
threw 

a 
perfect 

centering 
pass 
into 
the 

crease, 
leading 

to 
a 
desperate 

save 
from 
Notre 

Dame 
goaltender 

Cale Morris. It was 
apparent 
as 
junior 

forward 
Cooper 

Marody 
calmly 
set 

the puck on a dime 
for 
senior 
forward 

Tony Calderone, who 
let loose a dangerous 
shot from the slot.

These opportunities soon 

began to turn into goals. 
Thirteen minutes into the 
game, freshman defenseman 
Quinn Hughes skated into 
the offensive zone and fired 
from the blue line. His shot 
appeared to be going wide, 
but 
sophomore 
forward 

Adam Winborg met it with 
his stick, tipping it past 

Morris and into the net.

Shortly after 

that, 

senior 

forward Dexter 
Dancs 
snuck 

one 
inside 

Morris’ 
near 

post 
for 
an 

unlikely 
2-0 
lead. 

The 
noise 

wouldn’t 
come 
near 

its pregame 
levels again.

“The crowd 

was 
super 

loud,” 
said 

sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne. 
“They 
didn’t stop 
making 

noise 
for 

the 
first 
10 

minutes 
until 
we 

put that second goal 
in and we kinda put 
them to sleep, which 

was 
great 
because 
in 

an 
atmosphere 
like 
that, 

especially in college hockey, 
crowd plays a big role in 
energy and momentum. So it 
was great to get that on our 
side the whole night.”

Sunday saw another quick 

start for the Wolverines. 
Again, Marody beat Fighting 
Irish forward Jake Evans 
for the first face-off. Again, 
an 
energetic, 
high-speed 

Michigan offense earned a 
commanding advantage in 
puck possession and shots. 

Near the end of the period, 

the disparity was 15-2 in 
the Wolverines’ favor.

“Our 
guys 
were 

ready to play … That’s 
on them, that’s on our 
players,” Pearson said. 
“As 
coaches 
you 
can 

tell them some things and 
show them some things, but 
you’ve got to reach down to 
each individual and figure 
out a way to compete. And 
compete they 
did. We had 
a good first 
period, 
we 

were 
ready 

to play the 
game.”

And while 

Michigan 
didn’t 
find 

the 
net 
in 

the 
first 

20 
minutes 

Sunday, 
the chances it created kept 
the pressure on and kept 
confidence high.

“We showed that we could 

play with them,” Calderone 
said. “We were getting pucks 
deep, playing simple and it 
was working out. We were 
talking in the locker room, as 
long as we play like that it’s 
going to come.”

Calderone proved himself 

correct late in the second 
period. After Dancs forced 

a turnover in the Fighting 
Irish zone, Marody jumped 
on 
the 
puck 
and 
found 

Calderone all alone in the 
slot. 1-0, Michigan.

“We played with a lead all 

weekend,” Pearson said. “We 
were never behind against 
a pretty darn good hockey 
team.”

For 
the 
Wolverines 
to 

spring not only one, but two 
upsets against Notre Dame, 
that was a necessity. The 
Fighting Irish have scored 
first 21 times this season. 
Their record in those games? 
18-1-2.

Notre Dame came into the 

weekend No. 1 in the country 
for a reason, and it showed 
why quite often. Morris, a 
Hobey Baker candidate, made 
36 saves on Sunday, many of 
them highlight-reel worthy. 
The Fighting Irish outshot 
the Wolverines in the third 

period 
14-4 

on 
Friday 

and 12-10 on 
Sunday. 
But 

in the end, 
that wouldn’t 
matter, as in 
both games, 
Michigan 
threw 
the 

first punch.

The 

Wolverines 
didn’t 

allow 
rankings, 
all-world 

goaltenders 
or 
a 
rowdy 

Whiteout 
atmosphere 
to 

set the tone this weekend. 
Instead, behind two torrid 
first periods, they earned a 
season-defining sweep.

“We knew what was at 

stake. It was no secret this 
was our season,” Calderone 
said. “… We knew it going 
into it, so everyone got up 
for the challenge and we 
accomplished our goal.”

With 1:34 remaining in 

the third period, the No. 18 
Michigan hockey team led, 
1-0, and No. 1 Notre Dame 
pulled its goaltender.

The Fighting Irish (16-5-

1-1 Big Ten, 22-8-2 overall) 
fired a fury of shots, looking 
for 
the 
answer 
against 

sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne.

With a bouncing puck in 

the crease, Lavigne found 
himself out of position near 
the right post and forward 
Andrew Oglevie stared at an 
empty net. Oglevie slung a 
shot that slid past Lavigne 
— but right through the 
crease.

The host Wolverines (11-

10-3-2, 
16-13-3) 
blocked 

four more shots and Lavigne 
made four more dramatic 
saves against the extra man, 
sealing the 1-0 victory and 
a series sweep against the 
nation’s best team.

“Couldn’t be happier for 

Hayden,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson. “He’s 
gotten the job done. That 
last 1:34 though, he’s got 
some 
friends 
somewhere 

watching 
over 
him, 

protecting that net.”

Michigan began the game 

with 
the 
same 
intensity 

it showed early in Friday 
night’s 
4-2 
victory. 
In 

the first six minutes, the 
Wolverines outshot Notre 
Dame, 
8-0, 
including 
a 

wrister by senior forward 
Tony 
Calderone 
that 
hit 

the 
goal 
post. 
Despite 

leaving quality chances on 
the doorstep for Michigan, 
Fighting 
Irish 
goaltender 

Cale 
Morris 
recovered 

with key saves to stif le the 

Wolverines’ early chances 
off loose rebounds.

Michigan subdued Notre 

Dame’s offense for the first 
half of the first period, 
with quick breakouts from 
the defensive zone, hard 
forechecks 
between 
the 

bluelines and seven blocked 
shots. Unable to mount a 
stable offensive attack, the 
Fighting 
Irish 
wouldn’t 

register 
a 
shot 
until 

almost 
eight 
minutes 

into the contest and 
were outshot, 15-2, 
through 
the 

first 
15 

minutes.

“We 

came out 
today, 
really 
limited 
their 
chances 
and 
kept 

it to the 
outside,” 
Lavigne 
said. 
“I 

thought 
we played 
a 
whole 

team game 

defensively. 
We 
managed 
the 
time 

much better 
in 
this 

game 
than 
the 

previous one. I think it just 
proved we improve night to 
night, and we’re a contender 
moving forward.”

However, 
as 
the 
clock 

wound down in the first, 
Notre Dame picked up the 
pace, recording six of the 
period’s last eight shots on 
net. With 22 seconds left 
in the period, sophomore 

forward Nick Pastujov was 
called for a slashing penalty 
and 
the 
Fighting 
Irish 

had their first power play 
opportunity.

But 
Lavigne 

stood 
tall 
between 

the 
pipes 
and 

squashed 

the 
late 
shot 

onslaught to keep the game 
scoreless heading into the 
first intermission.

“Their goalie is really 

good, 
there’s 
a 
reason 

why he’s a Hobey Baker 

candidate,” Pearson said. 
“But our guy’s pretty good, 
too.”

Entering 
the 
second 

period, 
the 
Wolverines 

killed 
the 
remainder 
of 

Notre Dame’s power play, 
only to find themselves with 
their own man advantage 
minutes 
later. 
Michigan 

wouldn’t find success on 
the power play, unable to 
accrue quality time in the 

zone and shots on goal 

— only posting one 

during the two 

minutes.

The 
second 

period 
continued 
with 

back-and-forth play and 
a 
bouncing 
puck, 
with 

neither team able to gain 
momentum or shots on the 
offensive rush.

With 
less 
than 
eight 

minutes left in the frame, 
the Fighting Irish had their 
second man advantage when 
junior 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody 
was 
assessed 
a 

penalty 
for 
interference. 

Notre Dame had five shots 
on goal on the power play, 
but timely stops by Lavigne 
— even with heavy traffic 
in the crease — kept the 
stalemate intact.

But with just 38 seconds 

remaining in the period, the 
Wolverines 
finally broke 
onto 
the 

scoresheet. 
Senior 
forward 
Dexter 
Dancs forced 
a 
turnover 

deep in the 

Fighting 
Irish zone 
and 
the 

puck 
found 
its 
way 
to 

Marody’s 
stick. 
The 

junior dropped a pass 
to a trailing Calderone, 
whose 
wrist 
shot 

def lected off Morris’ 
glove 
and 
into 
the 

back of the net for the 
game’s first — and 
only — goal.

“Very 
important 

goal,” Pearson said. 
“I thought whoever 
got that first goal 
could’ve been the 

only one of the 

game, just 

the way 

the 

game 

was 

going. 
The 

chances 
weren’t 
passing 

the goaltenders, the puck 
bouncing all around the net 
at both ends. It was a big 
momentum boost.”

Michigan returned for the 

third period with a renewed 
sense of energ y, outshooting 
Notre Dame, 10-4, through 
the first half of the stanza. 
Though a surplus of shots 
from the home team, glove 
saves from Morris kept the 
Wolverine lead at one.

On the other end of the 

ice, 
the 

Fighting 
Irish 
struggled 
to 
sustain 

pressure 
in 
the 

Michigan 
zone. 
Lavigne 
continued 
to stand on 
his 
head, 

making 

countless saves, controlling 
rebounds and subsequently 
limiting second chances.

With Morris pulled for 

the last 90 seconds of the 
contest, Notre Dame would 
continue to throw its best 
at Lavig ne. But even with 
35 shot attempts in just the 
third period, the Fighting 
Irish couldn’t capitalize. 
Lavig ne 
would 
make 
35 

saves, 
hold 
on 
for 
his 

third shutout of the season 
and secure the win — and 
sweep.

“I think ever ybody just 

took a whole new mindset 
that we had to get this 
done,” 
Lavig ne 
said. 

“Ever ybody really wanted 
to win, we knew what was 
at stake and people were 
sacrif icing their bodies.”

Added 
Calderone: 
“ We 

just 
competed 
with 
the 

best team in the countr y. I 
think we can show that we 
can play with anyone. … We 
have all the pieces, we’re 
just starting to put them 
together.”

“We were never 
behind against a 

pretty good 

hockey team.”

“That was maybe
 our best period
 of the year. We 
were dialed in.”

“We have all the 
pices, we’re just 
starting to put
 them together.”
