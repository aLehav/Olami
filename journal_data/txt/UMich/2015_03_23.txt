MUSIC Matters 
to host Oscar, 

Grammy-winning 

hip-hop artist

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

One could say that this year’s 

MUSIC Matters headlining act 
has a certain amount of “glory.” 
He’s known for his philanthropy 
and his meaningful lyrics. He’s 
“faithful,” he’s “funky for you” 
— and at the end of the day, sign-
ing him just seems like common 
sense.

Common will take the Hill 

Auditorium stage April 17 to 
close SpringFest. He follows in 
the footsteps of 2 Chainz in 2014, 
Ben Folds in 2013 and J. Cole in 
2012.

Though Common has been a 

mainstay in the hip-hop com-
munity for years, he has recently 
received acclaim for his collabo-
ration with John Legend on 

“Glory,” a song from the film 
“Selma” that won both a Golden 
Globe and an Academy Award 
this year. He also won a Gram-
my in 2003 for Best R&B Song, 
“Love of My Life (An Ode to 
Hip-Hop).”

Business senior Darren Appel, 

MUSIC Matters president, said 
the organization signed Com-
mon to close SpringFest because 
his 
background 
aligns 
with 

MUSIC Matters’ philanthropic 
goals.

In addition to funding an 

endowed “Big Thinkers” schol-
arship that is set to support 
its first recipient in Fall 2016, 
MUSIC Matters is in the process 
of funding and designing a sum-
mer leadership camp through 
the University for underrepre-
sented youth from the Metro 
Detroit area that will launch in 
summer 2016.

Student tickets for the event 

will cost $15 for balcony seats, 
$30 for mezzanine, $40 for 
main floor and $70 for front row.

Former fraternity 
brothers charged 
with destruction 
of property, MIPs

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Several members of the Sigma 

Alpha Mu fraternity will face 
criminal charges for vandalizing a 
Gaylord, Mich. ski resort in Janu-
ary, the Otsego County prosecutor 
said Friday.

In a press release, Otsego 

County Prosecutor Michael Rola 
said several members of the fra-
ternity will be charged, including 
the SAM president, treasurer and 
another member.

The president and treasurer 

have been charged for minors in 
possession of alcohol and drugs 
and the other member will face 
a felony charge of Malicious 
Destruction of Building over 
$1,000, but under $20,000.

The fraternity has already said 

it will pay the restitutions in full.

The prosecutor said charges 

will likely be brought against 
additional members, as more iden-
tification information becomes 
available. The release said the 
Treetops Resort does not have 
security cameras in their common 
areas at the time of the ski trip.

“Due to the significant number 

of students attending at the time 
of the event in question deter-
mining the identities and spe-
cific actions of other individuals 
believed to be involved has been 
hampered, however additional 
steps are currently being taken to 
hold them accountable, and also 
to see to it that persons who were 
not involved in any of the alleged 
criminal activity are not falsely 
accused,” the release stated.

According to the Michigan 

State Police post in Gaylord, the 
state police has closed its investi-
gation, which had been in process 
over the last few months.

In 
January, 
the 
fraternity 

caused an estimated $250,000 
worth of property damage to the 
Treetops Resort. Resort officials 
also reported $200,000 in dam-
age to the resort’s brand, lost 
revenue and legal fees.

 Annual conference 

draws 1,200 

participants for 

lineup of 14 speakers

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

“Constructive Interference” 

was the theme at play during the 
sixth annual TEDxUofM event 
Friday at the Power Center. The 
event drew 1,200 people and 

featured 14 keynote speakers, 
all whom are affiliated with the 
University.

Constructive 
interference, 

in physical application, refers 
to waves meeting when travel-
ing along the same medium in 
opposite directions. The TEDx 
conference transformed this 
concept to discuss how the con-
fluence of conflicting ideas can 
shape each of the originals for 
the better.

Broken into four sessions of 

three to four speakers each, the 
day-long event included perfor-

mances by students and local 
acts and lunch provided by local 
venues. Those who purchased 
tickets beforehand were able to 
attend a dinner after the event 
supplied by Zingerman’s, which 
allowed the audience to meet 
the speakers.

Throughout the day, organiz-

ers promoted communicating 
with its participants through 
social 
media. 
People 
were 

encouraged to send any ques-
tions they had for the speakers 
via Twitter with the hashtag 

One year ago, 300 
married in Mich. 

before judge granted 

emergency stay 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Outside a small Ann Arbor 

pub Sunday evening, dozens of 
couple drank champagne, chat-

ted excitedly and blew bubbles in 
celebration of their wedding anni-
versaries. However, in the minds 
of many, Sunday was no ordinary 
anniversary celebration.

Same-sex couples from the 

Washtenaw County area gathered 
at Aut Bar on Sunday to commem-
orate the anniversary of their first 
year of marriage — unions granted 
during a one-day period last year 
when same-sex marriage was 
legal in Michigan.

On March 22, 2014 — the day 

after U.S. District Judge Ber-
nard Friedman struck down the 
state’s same-sex marriage ban — 
Washtenaw County recognized 
74 same-sex marriages. The state 
issued 300 marriage licenses and 
married more than 100 couples 
directly within a five-hour period.

However, Michigan Attorney 

General Bill Schuette (R) request-
ed an emergency stay on the deci-
sion, which the Court of Appeals 
granted the day after Friedman’s 
ruling. Once the emergency stay 

went into effect, same-sex mar-
riage was no longer permitted.

Even so, the district court 

decided to recognize the 300 mar-
riages preformed prior to the stay.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for 

the Sixth Circuit upheld the Mich-
igan’s same-sex marriage ban last 
November. The case is now before 
the U.S. Supreme Court, which 
will hear oral arguments on April 
28.

organized the ceremony to bring 
together all couples that wed the 
day after Friedman’s ruling. Orr 
and his husband Martin Contre-
ras, the other co-owner of Aut Bar, 
were among the couples celebrat-
ing their first anniversary.

“We realized that within days, 

320 couples were going to have the 
same anniversary, and we were 
going to have to do something that 
day,” Orr said.

Washtenaw County residents 

Diane VanDorn and Connie Greer 
also wed during the brief window 
same-sex marriage was legalized. 
Though the two had been together 
for nearly 18 years and have raised 
four children together, they said 
they were elated after they finally 
received government recognition 
and protection.

“It was exciting because our 

children are safe now,” VanDorn 
said. “My spouse has had cancer 
and I’ve had a stroke and for them 
to be protected if something hap-
pens to one of us is really impor-
tant. And now we know that they 
are safe.”

Washtenaw County Clerk Larry 

Kestenbaum also attended the 
ceremony, and recalled his experi-
ence issuing marriage licenses fol-

lowing Friedman’s decision.

According 
to 
Kestenbaum, 

there was concern about a state-
mandated stay as soon as the deci-
sion was announced. He said amid 
the worry, the county supported 
him, allowing him to work over-
time and keep offices open to issue 
as many licenses as he could.

“A lot of people felt urgency to 

do something,” Kestenbaum said.

Kestenbaum said he felt disap-

pointed by the ruling of the Sixth 
Circuit Court to uphold the ban. 
He added that he believes the 
political affiliations of some Sixth 
Circuit judges were why they sup-
ported the ban.

“I was angry when the state 

came down, I was disappointed at 
the time of the ruling but I knew 
the ruling was not going to stand,” 
he said. “So I wasn’t that con-
cerned about it, other than that it 
was going to delay everything by 
another year or so.”

The Supreme Court decided in 

January to take up the legality of 
Michigan’s ban on same-sex mar-
riage, as well as similar bans in 
other states. The Court is likely to 
rule by June.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor (D) attended Sunday’s gath-
ering to support both the couples 
that were issued licenses and those 
still awaiting the ban’s overturn.

“Hopefully the Supreme Court 

will recognize that it’s peoples’ 
right to be married without regard 
to gender and that same-sex mar-
riage will be the law of the land,” 
Taylor said.

Kestenbaum said he believes 

the Supreme Court will rule in 
favor of same-sex marriage, as 
Justice Anthony Kennedy and 
other justices have been open to 
marriage equality in the past.

“I think the Supreme Court 

decision in June will be very much 
along the lines of almost all the 
other federal court rulings on the 
matter and that this will settle and 
be done,” he said. “From there, 
I’m not sure what the next issue 
is going to be, but I think this is a 
pretty big one.”

Orr echoed Kestenbaum’s opti-

mism, saying the state will only 
have true marriage equality once 
all, not just some, same-sex cou-
ples have the opportunity to get 
married.

“One of the things I say all the 

time is that for us, we didn’t get 
marriage equality a year ago,” Orr 
said. “If we got marriage equal-
ity, Sandy and Linda over there 
would be married as well. We got 
something that straight couples 
have already, which is marriage 
privilege. So what we’re hoping for 
is a good Supreme Court ruling in 
June that will give true marriage 
equality for everyone.”

Regents release pres. search docs

MADELINE BATH /Daily

Kinesiology freshman Charlie Leonard performs at the annual 
TedxUofM at the Power Center on Friday.

DON ’ T FALL 

The University’s Board 

of Regents released all 
documents 
pertaining 

to the 1988 presidential 
search following a six-
year legal battle with two 
newspapers.

The files revealed the 

Board was prepared to 
nominate Vartan Grego-
rian, the president of the 
New York Public Library, 
for the job in June 1988.

Regent Deane Baker (R–

Ann Arbor) was the only 
board member opposed to 
Gregorian’s 
nomination. 

Without 
telling 
Regent 

Paul Brown (D–Petoskey), 
chair 
of 
the 
Presiden-

tial Selection Committee, 

Baker 
called 
Gregorian 

just before the Board was 
set to announce its nomi-
nation.

“I did call the man,” 

Baker said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily. 
“I told him I would not 
support him. I did what I 
thought was good for the 
University.”

Gregorian withdrew his 

name from consideration 
following Baker’s phone 
call.

“When 
Regent 
Paul 

Brown called to ask if I 
had made a decision, I told 
him I did not want to go to 
a place where someone was 
pledging 
guerrilla 
war-

fare,” Gregorian said in an 
interview with the Detroit 
Free Press.

The regents’ search was 

secret, with the Board 
insisting that the candi-
dates’ privacy superseded 
efficiency. To avoid violat-
ing the Open Meetings Act, 
which says a group of pub-
lic officials cannot meet 
secretly, the regents met in 
groups of four throughout 
the search process.

The 
search 
took 
14 

months, cost more than 
$90,000 and incurred an 
additional 
$337,000 
in 

legal fees.

Residential College hosts 
Midwestern publications

Voices of the Middle 

West conference 
recognizes local 

writers and journals

By TANAZ AHMED 

Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Saturday, 
East 
Quad 

Residence Hall’s atrium hosted 
literary journals from across the 
Midwest for the second annual 
Voices of the Middle West 
festival.

Midwestern Gothic, an Ann 

Arbor-based literary journal, 
hosted the event in conjunction 
with the University’s Residential 
College.

According to Robert Russell, 

event organizer and co-founder 
of 
Midwestern 
Gothic, 
the 

purpose of the festival is to 
showcase 
talented 
writers, 

independent 
journals 
and 

presses from the Midwest. A 
book fair allowed participating 
presses to display works and 
publications.

“The 
Midwest 
is 
usually 

considered 
flyover 
states,” 

Russell said. “This is a really 
cool way to show everyone what 
great authors we have and how 
different they are.”

Last year, the event had 23 

different presses and journals. 
This year, the festival was 
expanded to 36 professional 
and student publications from 
Ann Arbor, Michigan and other 
midwestern states.

Representatives 
from 

journals such as the Iowa 
Review, 
Pleiades, 
Southern 

Indiana Review and cream 
city 
review 
came 
from 

Iowa, Missouri, Indiana and 
Wisconsin, respectively, to join 
the festival.

“We want to show all the 

different voices of the Midwest,” 
Russell said. “It’s so vast. There 

are so many states and there is 
so much uniqueness.”

Student 
publications 
from 

the University such as Xylem, 
Fortnight, RC Review and the 
Lloyd Hall Scholars Program: 
Arts and Literary Journal also 
took part in the event.

LSA junior Kara Mullison, 

a member of the Residential 
College’s RC Review, said she 
was glad the festival took place 
in East Quad and included 
student publications.

“It’s nice that the festival is 

in East Quad where the RC is 
based,” Mullison said. “Student 
publications might not seem 
relevant but you come here and 
see that they are.”

On top of the book fair, 

there were also multiple panels 
throughout the day. The first 
panel was a faculty and student 
discussion on the publishing 
process. In the next panel, 
writers Melba Boyd, Caitlin 
Horrocks, 
C.J. 
Hribal 
and 

Marcus Wicker spoke about the 
Midwestern landscape.

Other panels included gender 

in the publishing industry and 
the use of Midwestern fables 
and myth. There was also an 
open mic where community 
writers could share their work.

The event concluded with 

a keynote lecture by Stuart 
Dybek, 
author 
of 
“Ecstatic 

Cahoots,” a book of short stories. 
Dybek spoke about how the 
physical place where literature 
is produced and the history of 
the location impacts the writing 
itself.

“Writers have had this huge 

magical ability to create our 
version of how we respond to the 
places that we live in,” Dybek 
said.

Recent LSA graduate Sydney 

Salley said she was impressed by 
the entire festival.

“It’s incredible how big it is, 

how many people are coming 
from all around and how there’s 
interest from within students 
and outside,” she said.

$10 more at each seating level. 
The concert’s proceeds will go 
toward MUSIC Matters’ charity 
projects.

“Some of the work that he’s 

done with the Common Ground 
Foundation and helping to teach 
underserved youth in Chicago, 
we thought it tied in very well to 
some of the goals with the lead-
ership camp that we’re trying to 
build with underserved youth in 
Detroit,” Appel said.

Information 
junior 
Madi 

Chone, MUSIC Matters talent 
and concert chair, added that 
Common’s recent spike in popu-
larity and connection to culture 
shift make him a relevant per-
former for a University audience.

“What (Common) has done 

— it’s breathtaking, it’s beauti-

ful, everything that he’s accom-
plished,” she said. “But outside 
of that, I think, considering his 
Oscar and Grammy win, and just 
the work that he’s been putting out 
recently, there isn’t really a more 
relevant artist socially that we 
want to provide a platform for.”

Common, born Lonnie Rashid 

Lynn, Jr., founded the Com-
mon Ground Foundation over a 
decade ago “to use creative arts 
to expose youth to new opportu-
nities,” according to the founda-
tion’s website.

“I think hip-hop now is kind 

of being elucidated as an art 
form that has a lot of potential to 
move social justice and to affect 
changes,” Chone said. “I think 
(Common) is not just a promi-
nent figure in that right now, 
he’s one of the figures that’s 
responsible for founding that.”

The foundation’s education 

initiatives include the Dream-

er’s & Believers Youth Mentor-
ing Program, partnering on the 
Chicago Youth Jobs Collabora-
tive and creating job training for 
underserved Chicago youth.

“I 
started 
the 
Common 

Ground Foundation because I 
wanted to help,” Common wrote 
in a statement on the website. 
“I always believed that if we 
started with the youth then we 
would be planting the seeds for 
our future to blossom.”

LSA 
senior 
Marli 
Siegel, 

MUSIC Matters communication 
chair, echoed Appel’s sentiment 
that 
Common’s 
involvement 

aligns with the organization’s 
mission. She said this year’s 
iteration of SpringFest high-
lights the idea that “it’s put on 
by students for other students,” 
not only in the University com-
munity but elsewhere.

“If you just look at our out-of-

pocket expenses, things we’ve 
paid to contractors, third par-
ties, it’s around $230,000. It 
doesn’t take into consideration 
management time or damage 
to the resort’s reputation. Our 
accountants and attorneys are 
saying that this could be up to 
an additional $200,000,” Barry 
Owens, Treetops Resort general 
manager, wrote in a statement 
Friday.

The University’s chapter of 

SAM was disbanded earlier this 
week by its international board 
in part for refusing to cooperate 
in an investigation, as members 
declined to name individuals 
involved in the destruction.

The current members have 

been placed on alumni status, 
meaning they cannot affiliate 
with another chapter, do not have 
the rights associated with under-
graduate membership and are 
ineligible for SAM scholarships.

The chapter members must 

move out of their house by May 3.

In February, the University’s 

disciplinary proceedings ruled 
that the fraternity would no 
longer be recognized as a cam-
pus organization and could not 
reapply for a return to campus 
for four years.

The sanction was the most 

severe penalty the University 
could levy on a student organiza-
tion. It requires SAM to pay the 
damage to Treetops in full and 
participate in “restorative mea-
sures” in the Gaylord community.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
is still in the process of review-
ing the investigation, but will 
consider initiating individual 
complaints through the student 
judicial process.

“We have said all along that 

we wanted individual account-
ability and that if additional 
information became available 
we would consider that informa-
tion,” he said.

The Sigma Delta Tau soror-

ity was also on the ski trip with 

SAM and faces a two-year dis-
ciplinary suspension, but will 
continue to be recognized by the 
University.

LSA junior Alex Krupiak, 

president of the Interfraternity 
Council, said Greek life lead-
ership has previously said the 
events in Northern Michigan 
were unfortunate and disap-
pointing.

“We have always hoped and 

expected that the involved mem-
bers would be held accountable 
for their actions,” he wrote. “We 
are confident that Greek Life 
will continue to move forward 
and impact campus in a positive 
manner.”

“These incidents simply do 

not reflect the University of 
Michigan’s values or its expec-
tations,” E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life, said in 
a statement. “The behaviors are 
a contradiction of what it means 
to be in and of a community, 
and we do not believe that being 
away from campus is a license to 
act in destructive and irrespon-
sible ways.”

Datta said roughly 200 more 
high school students submit-
ted pitch ideas this year, due in 
part to the fact the expansion of 
Startup High School’s advertis-
ing. The organization previous-
ly only catered to Detroit-area 
schools — this year, however, 
it appealed schools in areas 
including Metro Detroit, Grand 
Rapids and Battle Creek.

Datta and other members 

of Startup High School visited 
numerous Michigan schools and 
delivered guest lectures encour-
aging students to submit to the 
competition.

Datta 
explained 
that 
the 

workshop was meant to provide 
a learning experience for the 
semifinalists, who will now be 
allowed to re-submit their origi-
nal pitches with their “field day” 
lessons in mind.

Saturday’s event consisted of 

several guest speakers, a pre-
sentation at the headquarters 
of the business accelerator Ann 
Arbor SPARK, a tour of Google’s 
Ann Arbor offices and workshop 
activities for the students.

Bill Mayer, SPARK’s vice 

president 
of 
entrepreneur-

ial services, spoke to the high 

school students about the pros 
and cons of entering the entre-
preneurial field.

“I find it very valuable to pres-

ent to people that are in high 
school,” Mayer said. “They’re 
thinking about their college 
choices, and if entrepreneurship 
is something that they’d really 
like to explore as a career choice 
after they graduate, having a 
university with a good entre-
preneurship curriculum is very 
important.”

Mayer said joining a startup 

tends to yield a meager sal-
ary. However, he added that 
recent college graduates are 
often eager to work on startups 
because they provide a unique 
environment with a direct con-
nection to an issue those stu-
dents care a great deal about.

“It’s a very nice path,” he said. 

“The earlier we can start, the 
better.”

After the presentation at Ann 

Arbor SPARK, the high school 
students were given a campus 
tour of the University, followed 
by a visit to Google’s Ann Arbor 
office, where Ed Lee, an employ-
ee of Google for Entrepreneurs, 
reminded the high school stu-
dents that even Google was a 
small company at one point, but 
became a thriving, multi-bil-
lion-dollar corporation through 

innovative ideas.

After the presentation, the 

students were invited to inter-
act with one of Google’s newest 
products — Google Cardboard. 
The toy is a simple cardboard 
box that, when fitted with a 
smartphone and special appli-
cation, create a virtual reality 
experience.

At the end of the day, students 

split into startup-related work-
shops led by members of Start-
up High School. One group, for 
example, discussed the impor-
tance of networking in develop-
ing a product.

Another group focused on 

product 
marketing. 
In 
this 

group’s main activity, students 
were given an amusing object 
and were then tasked with cre-
ating a series of selling points 
for it. Among these objects were 
a coconut bra and a pair of rain-
bow suspenders.

Among the semi-finalists was 

Evan Morton, a senior at Detroit 
Edison Public School Academy 
in Detroit. He said that he came 
to the event to re-evaluate his 
pitch and to get some outside 
help.

“They had a lot of useful 

information, especially break-
ing off into the workshops,” he 
said. “I wouldn’t trade this for 
anything. It was very valuable.”

#TEDxUofM. After their official 
lectures, the speakers answered 
these questions in interviews, 
which the University then posted 
on its Snapchat story.

Prior to the event, attendees 

were asked to complete the sen-
tence “The source of my energy 
is...” Their answers were printed 
on their nametags to spark conver-
sation. LSA sophomore Anthony 
Okaneme’s nametag said his source 
of energy was “drive.”

Some speakers discussed over-

coming hardships in their respec-
tive fields, others groundbreaking 
work in areas such as technology 
and health and others of combin-
ing different passions to solve prob-
lems. University professors, who 
discussed using outside passions 
to enhance their students’ learning 
experience, gave two of the most 
popular talks.

Herbert Winful, a professor of 

electrical engineering and com-
puter science, spoke about incor-
porating music into one of his 
engineering courses after one of 
his students died in a car crash. 
In the talk, “How Hidden Pas-
sions Can Connect People,” Winful 
explained that combining the two 
disciplines helped his engineering 

students cope with and pay hom-
age to the student.

Winful said it was relatively easy 

for him to choose the theme for his 
talk because the event’s theme of 
constructive interference was an 
idea that he teaches every day.

“I teach optics, and in optics we 

deal with waves, and waves get 
constructive interference,” Winful 
said in an interview after the talk. 
“I thought, wait, maybe I’ll com-
bine what I do in engineering with 
my passion for music, and see how 
they’ll interfere constructively.”

Winful also discussed how 

music has helped him overcome 
other struggles throughout his 
life. He admitted that this might 
be unexpected for someone whose 
career focuses on optics and pho-
tonics, but added that his grand-
father was a music composer, and 
subsequently music has played a 
significant role in his life.

He ended his talk by fulfill-

ing a dream of his — performing a 
song of his own composition titled 
“Spirited Away” on the piano. He 
said he is currently teaching a class 
on risk-taking and it only felt natu-
ral to end the talk on that note.

“I really liked Herbert Winful’s 

whole discussion on engineering 
and art connecting and stuff, and 
how you can bridge the path and 
find out things you don’t know 
by taking things that aren’t usu-

ally seen together and combining 
them,” Okaneme said, adding that 
the talk was one of his favorites 
Saturday.

Comprehensive Studies Lec-

turer Jill Halpern’s talk, “Beyond 
STEM: The Whole Flower Class-
room,” was memorable for both 
her message and delivery. Halpern 
spoke in rhymes for a portion of the 
presentation, mimicking the form 
of Dr. Seuss’ “The Sneetches.”

She used the metaphor of a 

flower’s growth to describe the 
community she built within her 
classroom. Halpern teaches Calcu-
lus II, which she said was formerly 
known as “the most failed class at 
the ‘U’ ” by students — now, she 
said, the course ratio yields roughly 
103 students with A’s and B’s, and 
only one with a grade falling in the 
D and E range.

Halpern told the story of how 

she was lenient toward a student 
who was caught cheating by dis-
cussing her motives for cheating 
instead of just doling out punish-
ment. This process, Halpern said, 
allowed the student to grow and 
later admit that even though she 
was tempted to cheat again, she did 
not.

Halpern incorporated humor 

throughout her talk, which kept 
the audience captivated and laugh-
ing.

LSA senior Anuhya Bhogineni, 

whose energy source was “hope,” 
said she has watched TED videos 
online and had been to two other 
TEDx events, but was eager to 
attend the event Friday because all 
of the speakers were affiliated with 
the University. Bhogineni pointed 
out Halpern’s talk as one of her 
favorites.

Other talks throughout the day 

centered on the constructive inter-
ference within social media.

Cliff Lampe, associate professor 

at the School of Information, and 
Researcher Kyra Gaunt, a member 
of the University’s ethnomusicolo-
gy faculty, took different approach-
es to this concept.

Lampe argued against the com-

mon narrative that social media is 
bad for people by noting its benefits 
in his talk, “Social Media is Good 
For You.” He said most people 
spend the majority of their time 
around people like themselves, but 
can interact with a more diverse 
range of people through social 
media, gaining new information 
and perspectives with which they 
would otherwise not come into 
contact.

He acknowledged that anony-

mous social media platforms like 
YikYak can be places for cyber bul-
lying; however, he added that they 
also serve as forums where people 
can gain help for things they would 
feel uncomfortable turning to their 

friends for, such as suicide.

In summary, Lampe said, social 

media is a place for “social groom-
ing.” In some cases, he said, people 
can feel loved by others through 
sites such as Facebook.

“One of the important parts of 

social media is this social grooming 
effect,” Lampe said. “The likes, the 
votes, the shares, the comments, 
what we consider banal, can be 
extremely important.”

While Lampe said he does not 

think that, on his birthday, all of his 
500 Facebook friends would send 
him a cake, and he probably would 
not want 500 cakes, if they had not 
posted “Happy Birthday” on his 
wall, they probably would have not 
reached out to him at all.

After the talk, Lampe explained 

why he chose to speak on the posi-
tive aspects of social media.

“When I was talking with stu-

dents, I realized that a lot of them 
felt really bad about their social 
media use,” Lampe said. “A lot 
of them were talking about how 
they’d gotten off Facebook, and 
they felt ashamed of their social 
media use, and I thought ‘you know 
what? I’m just going to do a very 
simple social media is good for you 
talk,’ and that’s the one (the orga-
nizers) really clicked with.”

Though Gaunt agreed in her 

talk, “Broadcasting Black Girls’ Net 
Worth,” that the social grooming 

aspect of social media is important 
to study, she said this is not so for 
the positive reasons that Lampe 
described.

Gaunt, who earned her Ph.D. 

in musicology and ethnomusicol-
ogy from the University, began her 
speech by recounting her audition 
process in the Power Center years 
before she broke out into an opera 
song. From there, using her per-
sonal anecdote of overcoming her 
feelings of low self-worth, she tran-
sitioned into her research today on 
Black girls younger than 18 twerk-
ing in YouTube videos online.

While Lampe discussed how 

social grooming helps build people 
up, Gaunt spoke on how it dete-
riorates young African American 
girls’ self worth. She said 40 per-
cent of the videos that fit into this 
category are uploaded by men, and 
the comments section sexualizes 
and degrades the minors featured 
in the video, which is harmful for 
their self-confidence.

Okaneme, the LSA sophomore, 

said he would like to see more 
events like TEDxUM.

“I’ve always really enjoyed going 

to TED talks and have watched 
them online,” he said. “The chance 
to do this on campus sounded 
great. It’s been really interesting, 
there’s a lot of different speakers 
from across different disciplines, 
and I thought that was really nice.”

junior Jibran Ahmed, MUSIC 
Matters 
fundraising 
chair, 

referenced the organization’s 
pending 
summer 
leadership 

camp 
for 
underrepresented 

Detroit ninth graders.

“Our hope with that camp 

is to bring together these stu-
dents, show them that one, col-
lege is attainable and something 
that is very much tangibly in 
reach for them, and two, to pro-
vide them the resources, expe-
rience, mentorship that allows 
them to continue their higher 
education pursuit,” he said.

He added that the summer 

program will likely form a rela-
tionship with its participants 

through the University’s Detroit 
Center that allows the students 
to regularly return to Ann 
Arbor for continued mentorship 
with MUSIC Matters students 
throughout high school.

As far as SpringFest goes, Sie-

gel said the layout will remain 
the same as last year’s event. 
Participating student organiza-
tions will be stationed through-
out the Diag up to North 
University Avenue, and split 
into five sections: arts, innova-
tion, sustainability, social iden-
tity and philanthropy.

Food trucks will line up 

North University, along with 
a local farmers market and a 
station for MTank — where a 
panel of judges will evaluate 
startup pitches from Univer-
sity students. Ahmed noted that 

SpringFest will also feature its 
inaugural fashion show, bring-
ing together a number of student 
groups in the “fashion realm.” 
The event’s overall theme will 
focus on social activism.

“A big thing too, with Com-

mon, having someone like him 
with his respect at a historic 
venue like Hill, where all these 
speeches have been, where 
Martin Luther King (Jr.) has 
been … Hill is seen as that his-
toric place where all sorts of 
impactful speeches have been 
given,” Ahmed said. “To bring 
someone like Common in there 
just kind of merges the venue’s 
historical value with our mis-
sion with his mission, and we 
just really think that’s a nice 
mesh.”

their saliva, etc. — these elements 
often don’t come into my conscious 
awareness. My mind filters out 
all this “disgusting” information 
automatically before I perceive 
the person (more precisely, before 
I perceive my virtual image of the 
person). And it’s not like I couldn’t 
have access to the censored infor-
mation if I so desired. If I thought 
about it — that is, if I made a con-
certed effort to bring such knowl-
edge into my conscious awareness 
— I could integrate the gross/dis-
gusting stuff into my virtual image 
of the person. For example, as the 
children’s 
potty 
training 
book 

taught me, “Everybody Poops,” 
I know declaratively that all the 
gross/disgusting stuff is going on, 
but I have an unconscious psycho-
logical censor that keeps me from 
actively thinking about the gross/
disgusting stuff, and thus keeps 
this knowledge from entering my 
(conscious) virtual reality.

When we interact with people 

over social media, we are already 
interacting with these sterilized or 
cleaned-up versions of other people 
— that is, their virtual selves. Social 
media expedites the censorship or 
filtration process. It does so in two 
ways: (1) the user puts forward the 
virtual image of themselves that 
they want to represent them, and 
thus the burden of censorship is 
reversed and transferred to the 
gross/disgusting individual, not 
the person interacting with him, 
her or them. (2) The social media 
provider (Facebook, Twitter, Ins-
tagram, etc.) limits the expression 
of its users by defining what virtual 
representations of people are pos-
sible such that only clean, virtual 
versions of its users can exist with-
in the social media. Through these 
two complementary cyber process-

es, the social media platform, along 
with other people/users, expedites 
the work of censoring the undesir-
able elements of themselves and 
constructing clean, virtual versions 
of people for us to interact with.

In short, social media is the 

device of the lazy fantasizer. We 
still have to do some work compil-
ing the often fragmented images 
of people — and by images I don’t 
simply mean their photos, rather 
the full spectrum of components 
of users’ virtual (social media) 
self-representation — but largely, 
the work of fantasy production 
has largely been co-opted from the 
individual psyche and reallocated 
to 
the 
given 

social 
media 

paradigm 
and 
 

its users.

Apart 
from 

these two main 
processes 
of 

the 
construc-

tion 
of 
social 

media’s virtual 
reality, there is 
the element of 
the user’s individual choice of the 
content he or she encounters. I, as 
a Facebook user, can, to an extent, 
choose what content I want and 
don’t want. I can’t choose beyond 
what the social media paradigm 
allows me to choose, and if I choose 
to include other users, I often can’t 
choose which of their posts I see 
and which I don’t. But, I can choose 
who I am friends with on Facebook, 
who I follow on Twitter, what pages 
I “like,” etc. And so, in this way, I, as 
a user, exert more control over my 
virtual reality than I often can exert 
in everyday life, where images and 
information flow at me chaotically 
— that is, my encounter with them is 
often beyond my control. This great-

er element of control in the virtual 
world over the “real” world gives 
me pleasure. As a result, I may enjoy 
social media’s virtual reality even 
more than “real” virtual reality and 
therefore, in this sense, prefer it.

Bottom line: We enjoy social 

media because it offers us a stable, 
sterile, prefabricated virtual real-
ity through which we can “peep” 
on other stable, sterile, prefab 
“people” or users. We are always 
alone even when we are with other 
people, but when we are with other 
people through social media, we 
are even more alone with even 
more people. In ordinary, everyday 
conversation, people can disrupt 

our virtual rep-
resentations of 
them 
by, 
say, 

farting or oth-
erwise 
draw-

ing attention to 
the elements of 
themselves that 
our mind auto-
matically 
and 

unconsciously 
censors. 
But 

through social media, it is more 
difficult to disrupt our virtual 
 

reality or fantasy.

Social media allows us to be 

alone with other people like never 
before. We can enjoy our fantasy 
world with sterile, virtual users 
kept clean, tidy and at arm’s length 
much more easily than we can 
anywhere else (except, perhaps, 
in our dreams, which is the ulti-
mate place where we can be alone 
with people). Social media allows 
our fantasy to be constructed for 
us and to go on with relatively 
 

little interruption.

I

t’s Saturday, March 21, and 
I hear the beeping of my 
iPhone at 9:30 a.m. I lift my 

hand from the top 
of my black and 
yellow covers to 
a 
text 
message 

regarding pregam-
ing in an hour.

Today’s 
desig-

nated to celebrat-
ing 
St. 
Patrick’s 

Day. It’s a day-long 
shit show where 
students flock to 
fraternities. They 
dance on ledges 
and take pulls of Crystal Palace while 
 

belligerently drunk.

I head to a pregame hosted by my 

friend. Walking alone, I see a group 
of friends draped in green clothing. 
One girl has a green four-leaf clover 
taped on her cheek. She’s wearing 
a green shirt and a green tutu cov-
ering her pants. A guy is wearing 
a green cap, green suspenders and 
a green tank top with a shot glass 
cup necklace. I see another group 
of friends. A guy is wearing a white 
and green tank top, a leprechaun 
hat and green pants. He’s throwing 
Lucky Charms at a girl in a green 
snapback and green shorts. She eats 
them as her eyes glaze over, overly 
intoxicated. Everyone’s homoge-
nous. Everyone looks the same.

I walk faster to my friend’s 

house. I arrive and head upstairs. 
We quickly pound a few rounds in 
order to head out quickly.

We head to the nearest frat party. 

I enter an open space divided by 
friends interacting within their 
circles. Everyone’s wearing simi-
lar green outfits and talking only 
to their friends. They’re like little 
planets, and I revolve around them 
until I’m at the center, asking for 
a drink.

I continue revolving with the 

green planets around the green 
grass in the backyard. I see two 
planets collide as two girls recog-
nize each other. They look so happy 
interacting. Then they head back to 
their planets, continuing the same 
pattern, continuing to revolve, 
 

halfheartedly amused.

I see one of my friends. She’s danc-

ing on a ledge, so I join her. We find 
more friends and continue dancing. 
But we’re not really dancing. There’s 
not enough room on the ledge. We 
resort to compact motions.

I’m happy to be with my friends. 

We break out of our little planet to 
take a picture. It’s nice. We’re all 
smiling. But the smiles are decep-
tive. When that picture gets posted 
to Facebook, people will think that I 
spent the whole 
day ecstatic at 
these 
parties. 

At least, that’s 
what 
I 
think 

when I see those 
pictures on my 
newsfeed. 
The 

reality is that 
I’m only happy 
to be with my 
friends, and I’d 
be much happier 
if I was with the same people in a 
different context. A context that’s 
more my style, like a house party, at 
a bar or chilling at my house.

I’m still on a ledge dancing with 

my friends, but the monotony from 
performing the same motion is get-
ting old. I look around. On the side-
walk I see dozens of green people, 
pulsating through the grid of down-
town Ann Arbor, looking for the 
right party to revolve around, look-
ing for a place to belong. I look to 
my right and see a guy tugging on a 
girl’s wrist, trying to get her to leave 
the party. She looks flustered. She 
wants to stay here. I watch the scene 
until it ends to make sure she’s okay, 
and I proceed to watch her rejoin 
her planet.

I continue looking around and 

see everyone dancing on the ledge. 
I’m met with a dozen faces plas-
tered with a dozen shades of fab-
ricated enthusiasm. Perhaps I’m 
being too presumptuous, but almost 
no one looks like they’re having the 
kind of fun that warrants stand-
ing outside in 40-degree weather, 
wearing eclectic green clothing.

I stop and take a look at myself. 

I’m wearing a pair of bright green 

pants and a headband that I pur-
chased for last year’s partying. I’m 
nothing more than a component of a 
planet revolving around the system.

I can’t help but ask myself, 

“Why?”

Why do I commit myself to 

attending these parties at places 
where I clearly don’t belong? Why 
do I convince myself that I’m hav-
ing fun to justify attending again? 
Why do I go out of my way to wear 
stupid clothing to look like every-

one else? If it’s 
genuinely 
to 

avoid the fear 
of missing out, 
how 
much 
of 

a coward am I 
that I can’t dis-
associate 
from 

a system I don’t 
love?

I’m sure that 

some people are 
having fun at St. 

Patrick’s Day darties. I do see stares 
of genuine excitement, and I’m sure 
not everyone I perceive as bored 
actually is bored.

But I see too many people look-

ing unamused to think it’s just me, 
and I text too many friends after 
these events only hearing about 
lackluster experiences. Why do we 
so easily succumb to being little 
green toys in a little green backyard 
revolving around our little green 
planets when this isn’t what we 
want to do? The homogeneity and 
ridiculousness would make sense if 
everyone gushed with fun, but that 
doesn’t appear likely.

Getting into this school means 

someone thought you were spe-
cial. I’m not saying that to brag; it’s 
a reality. To get here, admissions 
officers holistically evaluated you 
and thought, “Wow, that person 
is both smart and unique enough 
to be here.” So why is untethering 
from these uninteresting, conform-
ing traditions so challenging for so 
many of us?

I don’t have an answer. Do you?

I

f, while listening to Robin Thicke’s, 
“Blurred Lines,” featuring T.I. and 
Pharell Williams, you couldn’t help 

but wonder — isn’t that a 
song already? The answer 
would be yes … or at least 
parts of it are, according to a 
federal judge.

Earlier this month, a 

federal judge ruled that 
“Blurred Lines” violated the 
copyrights of Marvin Gaye’s 
1977 song “Got to Give it Up.” 
The case awarded almost 
$7.4 million to Gaye’s family, 
and set a precedent that a 
song’s feel — not just its lyrics, composition or 
recording — is protected by copyright.

The 
decision 
complicates 
an 
already 

convoluted mess of copyright rules and 
precedents that increasingly fail to respond 
to the needs of digital music production. 
Sampling lyrics and progressions — never 
mind “feels” — from other artists’ work is 
commonplace and benefits consumers by 
yielding new creative works sporting the 
sound and style of familiar tunes.

Sampled work is popular. Kayne West’s No. 

1 album, Yeezus, features at least nine tracks 
that sample, and it debuted as the best-selling 
album on the Billboard 200 chart. But even as 
West has seemingly profited from the ability 
to build off of other artists’ works, fledgling 
artists often lack the means to do so legally.

Artists 
wishing 
to 
sample 
from 
a 

copyrighted work have limited options. 
They can seek permission to use a portion 
of the work, often agreeing to pay steep fees 
in exchange for the right to sample seconds 
of content. They could also use the sample 
without permission, risking a costly lawsuit if 
the copyright holder decides to challenge the 
use in court and expensive fines if their use of 
the work isn’t deemed fair use by the court. 
Fair use is a set of squishy factors — including 
the reason for and size of the sample, the 
creative content of the sample and the effect 
that sampling might have on the market — 
under which using a copyrighted work is 
permissible. Even the courts have had trouble 
deciphering the fair use clause, prompting the 
Supreme Court to resolve the contradictory 
precedent set forth in the various rounds of 
expensive and drawn-out lawsuits.

The Copyright Act of 1976 needs revision. 

Instead of requiring artists to play lawsuit 
roulette with their creative work, the law 
should be amended to include clear, specific 
definitions for permissible music sampling in 
its definition of fair use. The knowledge that 
using a sample of a specific type or length 
— for example, chord progressions lasting 
less than ten seconds — could promote the 
creation of new, legally compliant works by 
eliminating the current law’s ambiguity.

And just how necessary is a revision of fair 

use? Revisit the title of this column, where I 
have used lyrics from Secondhand Serenade’s 
track “Vulnerable.” Under current guidelines, 
whether or not this column breaks copyright 
law is ambiguous, and definitively unknowable 
unless challenged and ruled on in court.

Future copyright policy should focus 

on addressing two massive shortfalls of 
the Copyright Act: the unfairness of the 
law and the chilling effect the law has on 
 

musical creativity.

The new law should clearly define fair 

use in a way that adequately reflects the 
constitutional purpose of copyright law: to 
promote progress. The current law abjectly 
fails in this task. In effort to amply protect 
artists who have already profited from their 
work, the act fails to allow sufficient creative 
space for new artists, especially those wishing 
to take advantage of digital mixing technology 
and those coming from the hip-hop genre.

A clear and expanded definition of what 

constitutes an acceptable sample would 
further the mission of the Copyright Act by 
allowing for the progression and growth of the 
music industry. While incomes of individual 
music labels and artists may arguably decline 
due to the increased right to sample, it’s far 
from clear that the music industry itself will 
suffer, as new artists are incentivized to 
create sans the stifling fear of litigation.

Furthermore, 
allowing 
sampling 
will 

reduce the inequality created by the current 
law. The current legal process surrounding 
copyright 
features 
a 
wildly 
expensive 

discovery processes and all but requires 
expert legal counsel. Simplifying the law 
may allow artists to better understand their 
rights, even if they can’t afford an attorney.

Industry giants can afford to pay licensing 

fees or engage in the fair-use litigation game. 
But, ostensibly, less-established artists are 
extremely disadvantaged by a system that 
requires them to risk participation in lawsuits 
or pay fines they cannot afford. When artists 
can’t afford to play by the Copyright Act’s 
unfair rules, many quit the game altogether 
— choosing instead to flout the rules or stop 
producing. The effect is dichotomous: a 
massive silencing of nascent creativity and 
huge advantages for established artists. As 
the blog Priceonomics puts it, “a law that 
makes it impossible to play by the rules 
is not a good one.” Amending the fair use 
clause of the Copyright Act to definitively 
allow reasonable sampling will reduce 
the likelihood that new artists will find 
themselves choosing between two options 
that they cannot afford.

Music labels may counter with the 

argument that the effect of a less arduous 
policy will be hugely detrimental to an 
industry that has recently seen a substantial 
decline in revenue. But even with decreased 
profit margins, the music industry sustains 
extremely competitive supply, as up-and-
coming artists vie for benefits like fame, 
arena 
tour 
sell-outs 
and 
advertising 

contracts. Enormously high profits and power 
experienced by former captains of industry — 
or their heirs — are not necessary for future 
industry growth. A more relaxed copyright 
policy may actually help the industry by 
providing legal avenues for newcomers to 
sample in the same ways that established 
artists do. Because artists will still be 
sufficiently incentivized to produce, and 
more artists may be producing, the industry 
will likely benefit from this policy.

Regardless of opposing pressure from 

music industry behemoths, it’s essential that 
Congress amend the Copyright Act to include 
a precise, but permissive provision defining 
what 
constitutes 
a 
sample. 
Promoting 

creativity and fair competition is far more 
important than protecting the profits of the 
industry’s wealthiest.

Isn’t that a song already?

Why we enjoy social media
W

hy do we enjoy social media? 
What attracts us to it? What do 
we find enjoyable about it?

Maybe 
the 
obvious 

answer is that social media 
sponsors a new form of 
voyeurism — that is, watch-
ing someone without them 
knowing that you’re watch-
ing them for pleasure (espe-
cially sexual pleasure).

But 
what 
attracts 
us 

can’t only be social media’s 
voyeuristic 
capabilities, 

because social media also 
allows us to interact with 
other people. Inter-subjec-
tive interaction with the sex object used to be 
antithetical to voyeurism, but that’s no longer 
true with social media. Social media has cre-
ated a new kind of voyeurism — interactive 
voyeurism. Social media has thus created the 
possibility for high levels of fantasy previously 
exclusive to our dreams. We can now enjoy 
peeping on people without them knowing 
while simultaneously interacting with them 
(e.g., messaging with a person before, after or 

while viewing photos of them without their 
knowing).

Overall, though, the way we interact with 

people over social media — take Facebook, for 
example — is not so unlike the way we inter-
act with people in “real life” (by which I mean 
ordinary, non-digital intersubjective/interper-
sonal social life). Critics often want to condemn 
social media as pseudo-interaction or pseudo-
communication, but it does, in truth, operate 
on the same basic principles as any other form 
of interpersonal human interaction.

In our ordinary, non-digital life, our mind 

constructs virtual representations of people. 
We never deal with the person per se, only the 
mentally processed (or post-cognized) per-
son. How do we mentally process people? Our 
mind censors lots of information about a per-
son when it creates virtual representations of 
him or her, especially what we might call the 
“undesirable” or “impolite” information.

When I’m conversing with my friends, 

I’m interacting with a virtual representation 
of them that consists in their faces, maybe 
their clothing, what they’re saying, etc. But 
what isn’t included? Gross/disgusting stuff 
like their bowel movements, their sweat, 

Social media allows 
us to be alone with 

other people like never 

before.

Taubman program 
trains new architects

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

Though higher education is ide-

ally the gateway to the profession-
al world, there is often discrepancy 
between material taught in class 
and its practical application. In an 
attempt to bridge the gap between 
academic and professional set-
tings, the University offers vari-
ous 
degree-specific 
programs 

outside of the classroom, such as 
The Taubman College of Architec-
ture and Urban Planning’s Spring 
Break 
Connections 
externship 

program. Though Spring Break 
is often regarded as a relaxing 
departure from rigorous course-
work, many architecture under-
graduates spend their weeklong 
vacations learning the real-world 
applications of their scholastic 
endeavors.

Months prior to each Spring 

Break, the school’s Career Ser-
vices Coordinator Beth Berenter 
is hard at work, serving as a 
liaison between students and 
architecture firms. Berenter has 
catered to Taubman students 
desirous of professional experi-
ence since 1999, pairing them up 
with firms based on their loca-
tion preferences.

Berenter is inspired by the 

admirable work ethic of her stu-
dent clients.

“Architecture students typi-

cally work a lot of hours; school 
isn’t just going to class and going 
home,” Berenter said. “They 
literally live in the studio. The 
fact that they’re willing to give 
up any kind of break before the 
final push before graduation or 
the end of the term is a testament 
to the firms giving them a good 
experience.”

In terms of the feedback she 

receives 
each 
year, 
Berenter 

insists the program is less about 
studying and more about stu-
dents’ saturation within a profes-
sional environment. Each firm 
exudes a unique character specific 
to the organization, and Berenter 
stressed the indelible experience 
of students’ immersion within a 
specialized workplace.

“Many of the undergradu-

ate students have never seen the 
inside of an architecture firm, so 
they get an eye opening experi-
ence of what it’s actually like to 
be in a firm,” Berenter said.

Though 
originally 
created 

exclusively for undergraduate 
and graduate architecture stu-
dents in the early ’90s by the 
American Institute of Architec-
ture Students, the program has 
grown to also include graduate 
urban planning students. This 
year, 45 undergraduate architec-
ture students participated in an 
externship.

Among this year’s under-

graduate architecture extern-
ship participants were Taubman 
sophomore Taylor Boes and 
Taubman senior Nathaniel Ros-
neck. Boes travelled to Raleigh, 
North Carolina where she spent 
the week at Integrated Design. 
Rosneck chose Cooper, Robert-
son & Partners, a firm in New 
York City.

Boes began her education at 

Taubman last year as a member 
of the first class to be admitted as 
freshmen. She contributed to the 
college’s Research Through Mak-
ing exhibition, which explored 
various tactile fabric therapy sys-
tems for autistic children.

“It’s really cool to see immedi-

ate outcomes of your work,” Boes 
said. “Creating an environment 
that can do different things is 
really interesting to me.”

At Integrated Design, a small-

er firm of six architects, Boes had 
fully packed days from 9:30 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m. She opted for the 
Raleigh firm due to her sister’s 
residence in the city and its being 
the workplace of 2010 University 
alum Sam Berner.

In retrospect of her first 

externship, Boes spoke positively 
of her experience. She found a 
greater understanding of how 
an architectural firm functions 
through editing projects, sit-
ting in on meetings, working on 
renderings of three-dimensional 
models and attending an urban 
design conference.

“It 
was 
a 
really 
good 

experience to see what a day in 
the office was like, because its not 

always just ‘oh here’s the finished 
product,’” Boes said. “It was nice 
to see how architecture is outside 
of an academic context. It’s very 
different 
studying 
something 

and then going into the actual 
field.”

This year was Rosneck’s sec-

ond externship experience. Last 
winter, he participated in Dis-
ney’s college program for the 
duration of the winter semester 
at HuntonBrady firm in Orlando. 
This spring, he decided on the 
more concentrated environment 
of New York City at Cooper, Rob-
ertson & Partners.

“At Cooper Robertson, we 

worked on the design for a new 
lifeguard headquarters in Asbury 
Park, New Jersey,” Rosneck said. 
“I think what I found so interest-
ing about them is that they do a 
lot of urban planning projects.”

Rosneck and three fellow 

students worked in a team 
alongside two architects. The 
duration 
of 
their 
workday 

consisted of exploring the facets 
of urban sustainability in the 
exploration of materials and 
researching New Jersey codes 
and regulations for eco-friendly 
building on the coast.

Rosneck believes this year’s 

externship taught him the value of 
professional collaboration, which 
he regarded as a refreshing depar-
ture from the more individualized 
work throughout the school year.

“I think that when you get into a 

work environment, you really real-
ize how important collaboration 
is,” Rosneck said. “I think in stu-
dio projects we really tend to wrap 
our heads around our own project. 
You kind of zone in on what you’re 
doing, and in the real world that’s 
totally not the case.”

Both Boes’s and Rosneck’s 

beneficial externship experiences 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
possible 

without 
Berenter’s 
help, 
and 

Rosneck wasn’t shy to emphasize 
his appreciation.

“We’re so demanding, and I’m 

fascinated by how (Berenter) has 
been so accommodating and so 
well organized,” Rosneck said. 
“She’s a fantastic resource for the 
university.”

‘Glee’ reflects our 
adolescent selves

Beloved FOX series 
was the voice of a 

generation

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Every generation has a tele-

vision series that defines their 
coming-of-age 
experience. 
For us – gen-
eration Y, mil-
lennials, call it 
what you will 
– Ryan Mur-
phy (“American 
Horror Story”) 
created “Glee,” a theatrical repre-
sentation of the American adoles-
cent experience. As young adults 
now, we may have spent the past 
few years repressing our high 
school identities. But ultimately, 
whether we know it or not, wheth-
er we like it or not, part of us has 
been shaped by the “Glee” phe-
nomenon.

The series pilot first graced our 

screens in the spring of 2009 – for 
some of us, at the peak of middle 
school; for others, during our 
entrance into high school – for all 
of us, post “High School Musical” 
phase, right at the tumultuous 
threshold of the tween-to-teen 
transition. Almost immediately 
upon hearing the a capella notes 
of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” 
(or maybe Salt-n-Pepa’s “Push It”), 
we all dual-enrolled in our respec-
tive high schools and William 
McKinley High in Lima, Ohio.

But somewhere between that 

first moment and now, we grew 
older and forgot about “Glee.” The 
final season even had the low-
est viewership and ratings of the 
entire series. Some former hard-
core-Gleeks didn’t even know the 
series took its final bow and exited 
stage right as the curtain closed 
indefinitely this past Friday.

The two-hour finale, appropri-

ately titled “Dreams Come True,” 
was first a flashback to the 2009 
pilot, then a flash forward to 2020. 
The episode was just as perfect 
and just as flawed as the show 
always has been. And for one last 
time, it tried to tie up the loose 
ends at which viewers incessantly 
screamed.

In the present, McKinley is 

converted to a performing arts 
school, and the remaining alumni 
celebrate the exponential progress 
that developed before their very 
eyes over the seasons. In more 
ways than one, the episode wasn’t 
only the reunion of New Directions 
– it was the final union of this cast 
as they waved goodbye to an era.

Project forward into the future: 

all the characters have reached 
their theatrical and musical aspi-
rations, as well as their relation-
ship goals. Kurt Hummel (Chris 
Colfer, “Struck by Lightning”) and 
Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss, 
“A Very Potter Musical”) are also 
expecting a baby, whom Rachel, 
finally 
a 
Tony-award-winning 

actress, is carrying as a surrogate. 
Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch, “Two 
and a Half Men”) has managed 
to become vice president of the 
United States, but she also shows 
a softer, more mature side, in con-
trast to the jaded bitch we grew to 
know throughout the series. She 
makes sincere amendments in 
too-good-to-be-true monologues 
of inspiration and even rededi-
cates McKinley’s auditorium to 
the deceased Finn Hudson (Cory 
Monteith) – a noteworthy tribute 
to Monteith’s memory after he 
unexpectedly passed away two 
years ago. And everyone gives their 
greatest thanks to Will Schuester 
(Matthew Morrison, “What to 
Expect When You’re Expecting”), 
the man who started it all.

The finale, like the rest of the 

series, was not completely plau-
sible – superficially glossing over 
issues of continuity and using 
coincidences for expository conve-
nience. How could all the students 
have continued to be wildly suc-
cessful? The despicable Sue Sylves-
ter is future vice president of the 
United States? Almost every single 
high-school-sweetheart relation-
ship worked out?

Most 
of 
us 
slowly 
lost 

interest in the third season and 

eventually stopped watching by 
the fourth, primarily because 
the plot increasingly became 
unbelievable. 
As 
we 
gained 

our own experiences and grew 
slightly more cynical, we began to 
realize how the show’s depictions 
of reality were too perfect and too 
simply resolved. The show grew 
cheesy as we grew mature.

However, 
“Glee” 
addressed 

this point in the finale, when Sue 
Sylvester repeated an iconic Finn 
Hudson quote: “See the world not 
as it is, but how it should be.” Not 
everything needed to be a replica 
of reality in order for it to be pow-
erful and poignant. The show was 
never perfectly accurate, but it 
showed us the possibility of what 
situations could be – what charac-
ters have the potential to be – even 
if these representations may not be 
completely true in real life.

The fact is, we were also cheesy 

and tacky and unoriginal and 
hyper-overdramatic and pseudo-
inspirational; a superficial sheath 
of makeup complexions and foot-
ball jerseys, a mask of insecurities 
and inadequacies and idiosyncra-
sies. Our critique of and eventual 
disdain for the show was just a 
cringing reflection on the charac-
ters we were during our tumultu-
ous teens.

Regardless of what “Glee” has 

become, we cannot renounce the 
fact that we grew up with it. From 
middle school, the show held our 
hand as we stumbled through 
our own high school’s dim corri-
dors. Rachel Berry’s (Lea Michele, 
“New Year’s Eve”) voice soothed 
us to sleep after our first bad date 
or heartbreak. A little bit in all of 
us strove to be as effortlessly popu-
lar as Quinn Fabray (Diana Agron, 
“I am Number Four”), to be so 
naturally badass like Noah “Puck” 
Puckerman (Mark Sailing, “Rocky 
Road”). However, for all the freaks 
and geeks, the outsiders and lon-
ers, we found solace among the 
other misfits of McKinley. What 
we all soon realized was that we 
all, in some form or fashion, had 
a big ‘L’ on our foreheads. We all 
struggled to fit in; we all cried 
over our identity crises; we all had 
our respective haters – but we all 
found our refuge in glee club on 
Tuesday nights after school.

“Glee” shined a direct spotlight 

on our lives, but it taught us how to 
stand tall and proud, to take com-
mand over our own stage-fight of 
adolescence. By guiding us with 
uncomfortable renditions of “Boo-
tylicious,” and touching ones like 
“Cough Syrup” and “Imagine,” 
“Glee” gave us all the talks the 
adults in our lives couldn’t – or 
wouldn’t in high school.

“Glee” maturely addressed the 

nuances of sex, dating and rela-
tionships – miraculously providing 
progressive perspectives without 
making us cower in fear or scrunch 
our noses in disgust. The show 
demonstrated multidimensional-
ity behind the most controversial 
issues: it showed humility in even 
the most loathsome of characters, 
urging us to examine deeper and 
disperse empathy to all characters 
equally. Being a homosexual buff 
football player, being an upper-
class pregnant cheerleader, being 
a clumsy boy in a wheelchair – 
being in love with theater, song 
and dance – that was all ok, even 
if the real people in our lives never 
told us they were. Regardless of 
our identities, the series taught us 

how to tackle adversity with grace 
under pressure.

The fact is, “Glee” didn’t 

changed 
– 
we 
did. 
“Glee” 

transitioned from the show we 
loved, into the show we liked 
ironically, then finally into the 
show we loved to hate. The show 
was never a piece of cinematic art 
or screenwriting brilliance; what 
made the show memorable and 
significant was its timing at the 
crux of our generation’s malleable 
adolescent years, right when we 
needed it most.

Even if we haven’t sustained our 

devotion to “Glee” for the past few 
years, it was almost impossible not 
to cry during the series finale. It 
was still difficult to digest the final 
end notes: “do-ba-do-ba-do-ba-
dah-dahhh” as the credits rolled 
one last time. Regardless of how 
hard we try to bury our adolescent 
years, they are a period of life we 
can never negate. As awkward, 
confusing and uncomfortable as 
they were, they undeniably helped 
us define who we were – and who 
we are. As we turn from our teens 
into our twenties now, whether we 
like it or not, “Glee” had some sort 
of impact on raising us.

We are a Gleek generation.

Young cast carries 
lackluster ‘Insurgent’
More hype than 
depth in ‘Empire’

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

The idea of partitioning people 

by virtue – bravery, cleverness, 
service – was believable in the 
case 
of 
Hog-

warts 
because 

it was a school 
whose 
single, 

final arbiter was 
a 
talking 
hat. 

In “Insurgent,” 
the adult society 
commits to the 
wildly 
childish 

trope of separat-
ing by kind, and when our action 
kids inevitably break the bounds 
of that artificial division, it encour-
ages the young adult viewer to be 
bigger, more complex than what 
society tells her she’s allowed to be.

Imagining people complexly is 

a common theme in movies star-
ring nerdfighter Shaliene Wood-
ley (“The Fault in Our Stars”), a 
privately weird young adult who 
has been rising through a familiar 
starlet-to-star channel these past 
five years. Woodley plays Tris, the 
“100% Divergent,” who possesses 
the virtues of all five segments 
of society and who has abruptly 
become the face of an uprising 
which looks suspiciously like a 
similar rebellion of virtuous young 
people against conniving adults, 
where the true leader of the young 
protagonists is one more cruel 
adult. Sound familiar?

Woodley, playing the true-

blue mascot and allegory, does a 
remarkably good job. Given a role 
that demands rigid compliance 
to certain expectations, Woodley 
fulfills those expectations. She’s a 
good role model for the teens and 
tweens whose parents are crazy 
enough to take them to see this 
actually startlingly violent movie.

More praise for Woodley: her 

young adult movies actually have 
sex in them, and the sex isn’t total-
ly messed up. In “Insurgent,” the 
romance could easily have strayed 
into 
uncomfortable 
territory. 

Her partner, Four (Theo James, 

“Bedlam”), had been her instruc-
tor and a figure of authority over 
her, but as he and Tris show each 
other their true colors, they reach 
an equilibrium of trust, and by the 
time Tris chooses to have sex with 
Four, he’s every bit as emotionally 
vulnerable to her gaze as she is to 
his. The chemistry between the 
two of them is stellar.

Ansel Elgort (“The Fault in Our 

Stars”), meanwhile, has a softer, 
more familiar sort of chemistry 
with Tris playing her brother, 
thanks to Elgort and Woodley’s 
history as onstage romantic oppo-
sites. In their case, it was better to 
go from playing lovers to siblings 
than siblings to lovers. At least, it 
helped “Insurgent.”

Young adult books-turned-

movies have been getting very 
dark, so Peter (Miles Teller, “The 
Spectacular Now”) is a breath of 
fresh air, one realistically goofy 
frenemy in a sea of murky joke-
less subterfuge. In a small way, 
he carries the action through 
dramatic junctures where the 
plot begins to spin off its wheels.

The plot’s general direction 

is trite and known, so the direc-
tor’s job of shaking things up is 
not an easy one. Robert Schwen-

tke (“The Time Traveler’s Wife”) 
does a better job than Neil Burg-
er (the director of “Divergent”). 
Schwentke creates something 
that manages by the barest of 
margins not to insult the intelli-
gence of the young adult viewer. 
However, both of them fail the 
higher standard of constructing 
lastingly good movies.

Ordinarily, I would decry the 

pillaging of a book for the sake 
of moviemaking profit, but the 
Divergent series is a whore of the 
young adult genre, capitalizing 
on the successes of its betters. It 
can’t expect to be remembered, 
so it might as well get paid. The 
final book in Roth’s trilogy, Alle-
giant, will be split into two mov-
ies, dooming the remainder of 
the franchise.

Elgort, Woodley and Teller, 

on the other hand, each seem 
to have bright futures, and can 
expect deeper roles as they age. 
The eldest “kid,” 31-year-old 
Theo James, is adequate eye-
candy to roll forward on his 
looks and penchant for action 
roles. It’s rare that you have a 
young cast carry a badly struc-
tured film, but here’s one exam-
ple. Not bad.

Mega-hit FOX show 

proves spectacle 

sells big

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

From the moment “Empire” 

debuted, it was a hit. In its first 
week, 
it 
tied 

“How 
to 
Get 

Away 
with 

Murder” for the 
largest 
drama 

premiere 
of 

the 
broadcast 

season in the 
key 18 to 49 
demographic 
and scored 9.9 
million viewers (which fell below 
“Murder” and the new CBS dra-
mas). The vast majority of shows 
drop somewhere in the range of 
10 to 25 percent in their second 
week, but “Empire” grew, adding 
400,000 viewers. In its last epi-
sode, it garnered 17.6 million view-
ers and a 6.9 rating with a 21 share 
in the demo. This means that one 
out of every five people watching 
TV between ages 18 to 49 were 
watching “Empire,” making it the 
highest-rated network drama tele-
cast since the “House” season pre-
miere in 2009. The finale ratings 
will also easily surpass 20 million 
viewers when a week’s worth of 
DVR viewing is counted.

Numbers 
like 
that 
cement 

“Empire” ’s place as a cultural 
phenomenon. What are the pieces 
that supported it’s meteoric rise? 
Primarily, it’s how well the show 
does with African American view-
ers. According to ratings-guru Joe 
Adalian at Vulture, among Afri-
can Americans aged 18 to 49, the 
highest-rated episode of this show 
in that demo had more people 
watching than the Super Bowl. In 
addition, FOX was able to stack the 
episodes on their VOD and online 
platforms, meaning that they could 
keep more than the normal five 
episodes online at one time, giving 
people the opportunity to catch up. 
In fact, earlier this month, Gaude 
Morose, a FOX publicist, tweeted 
that 100,000 people were watching 
the pilot every day. There’s also the 
music. The “Empire” soundtrack 
sales were so high in its first week 
of release that they actually topped 
the sales of Madonna’s new LP, the 
first time she didn’t have the num-
ber one record during a debut week 

since the ’90s.

Notice that I haven’t actually 

mentioned anything related to 
the actual content of “Empire” ’s 
finale. That’s because “Empire” 
the cultural phenomenon is much 
more interesting to me than 
“Empire” the TV series, because 
“Empire” the show is a bit of a 
mess. The finale had some fantas-
tic moments, yet it shoved aside 
some of the best elements of the 
series and wasted some of the con-
siderable talent in its arsenal.

Both hours of the finale of 

“Empire” put the focus on Lucious 
Lyon (Terrence Howard, “Iron 
Man”). The main story of these 
episodes is about the characters 
gearing up for a tribute concert to 
the music mogul. Over the course 
of the season, Lucious has been 
the most frustrating character on 
the show because he is probably 
the furthest from an actual human 
being. These episodes had those 
same silly moments, like him giv-
ing a pillow as a “gift” to Cookie 
to represent her trying to smother 
him, or him looking at the camera 
through the bars at the end of the 
episode saying, “it’s game time 
bitches.” However, him repairing 
his relationship with his son Jamal 
(Jussie Smollett, “Revenge”) was 
enough to salvage his charac-
ter. Those moments appeared to 
be genuine, and getting over his 
homophobia 
actually 
showed 

character growth.

This focus on Lucious occurred 

at the expense of some of the show’s 
best pieces. In the role of Cookie 
Lyon, Taraji P. Henson (“Person 
of Interest”) is the show’s heart 
and soul. (I would be surprised if 
she’s not nominated for an Emmy 
in September.) She was brilliant in 

her featured moments, including 
the meeting with Malcolm (Derek 
Luke, “The Americans”) in her 
office and her attempted murder 
of Lucious after realizing he killed 
her cousin. However, there wasn’t 
enough of her. She was pushed 
aside to service Lucious’s story 
and that’s a shame. The series also 
had Jennifer Hudson (an Oscar 
winner for “Dreamgirls”) on for 
several episodes and never really 
found a way to give her an interest-
ing character. She got to sing, and 
she sounded gorgeous when she 
did, but her character never got to 
evolve beyond the religious music 
therapist. It was a slight waste of 
her talents.

Despite some of the story issues, 

the “Empire” finale maintained 
the show’s strong production 
qualities. The episodes had a slick 
look, especially the second hour 
which was directed by the talented 
Debbie Allen (“Fame”). The music 
continued to shine as well, with 
two memorable performances by 
Smollet in the rap battle and in 
the final performance of the new 
Luscious song (which featured the 
incomparable Patti LaBelle).

“Empire” is not even close to 

a perfect show. Some of its story 
twists and characterizations dur-
ing the first season didn’t make 
sense. However, the series has 
enough intrigue left to support a 
second season, with Lucious in 
jail, the hostile takeover of Empire 
in progress and the possible rami-
fications of the murder of Vernon 
(Malik Yoba, “Alphas”). It remains 
to be seen whether the show can 
maintain its momentum after a 
lengthy break, but it has enough on 
the table to make it worthwhile for 
those who return.

Season 1 
Finale

FOX

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Australian singer-songwriter 

Courtney 
Barnett’s 
debut 

album Sometimes I Sit and Think 
and Sometimes 
I Just Sit is 
exactly 
what 

the title says. 
It 
depicts 
a 

fascinating 
trip 
through 

Barnett’s 
mental 
workings; 
sometimes 
profound, 
sometimes 
nonsensical, 
but more than 
anything else, 
fascinating. 
In 
some 
facets 

she seems to know herself 
and everyone else better than 
anyone 
deemed 
possible, 

but in others she admittedly 
knows absolutely nothing. The 
juxtaposition 
of 
stream-of-

consciousness rambling, slow 
crooning 
with 
oh-so-subtle 

cymbals 
and 
in-your-face 

guitars successfully reveals a 
world of contradictions cloaked 
in a sleek sheet of tongue-in-
cheek humor.

The LP’s opener, “Elevator 

Operator,” recounts the day of 

one Oliver Paul. The first half 
of the song is hard to follow 
due to Barnett’s quick deliv-
ery, but once Paul finds himself 
in an elevator with a woman, 
they’re both headed to the roof. 
“Don’t jump little boy, don’t 
jump off that roof,” she says. “I 
think you’re projecting,” is his 
response. We don’t know what 
happens to her, but Paul heads 
to the room to play an imaginary 
game of SimCity. “Pedestrian 
at Best” is Barnett’s recogni-
tion that she is fully capable 
and prone to dick moves. She 
chants the chorus “Put me on a 
pedestal and I’ll only disappoint 
you / Tell me I’m exceptional, I 
promise I’ll exploit you / Give 
me all your money, and I’ll make 
origami, honey / I think you’re 
a joke, but I don’t find you very 
funny,” over head-banging gui-
tar riffs.

“An Illustration of Loneli-

ness” feels like a night alone in 
an apartment filled with mari-
juana smoke. You stare at the 
ceiling, think about palmistry 
and miss someone a lot. At this 
point in the album, it’s con-
firmed that Barnett seems to 
know stuff we don’t. Her depic-
tion of stories is poignant to the 
point where listeners will take 
anything she has to say as fact. 
She’s in the know in the same 

fashion as Jayden Smith, but less 
annoyingly so.

The narrative style present in 

“Elevator Operator” returns on 
“Depreston” and “Aqua Profun-
da.” The former is a combination 
of the words “depressing” and 
“Preston,” the town in which 
she finds herself looking at a 
house. The mundane delivery of 
the mundane subject turns into 
a social commentary. She is sad 
to move away from coffee shops, 
and then she sees a picture of the 
deceased owner and is unable to 
concentrate, but nearly instantly 
finds herself thinking, “I won-
der what she bought it for?” 
The track comes to a close with 
her agent stating, “If you’ve 
got a spare half a million / You 
could knock it down and start 
rebuilding” six times. With 
each repetition the irony in her 
voice becomes consistency more 
prominent to reveal the ridicu-
lousness of the statement.

“Aqua Profunda” narrates her 

experience attempting to impress 
a fellow swimmer at the pool, but 
in her vain attempt, she passes 
out from holding her breath and 
once she awakes, he is gone.

It is the storytelling present in 

tracks that make the album inter-
esting. The lyrics are not miracu-
lous themselves, yet somehow 
through delivery and produc-

Lyrical wit abounds 
in Barnett’s debut

I Just Sit

Mom + Pop Music
tion, Barnett manages to make 
impressive songs that don’t even 
have infectious choruses.

The stand out track of the 

second half of the album, “Nobody 
Really Cares If You Don’t Go to 
the Party,” is a commentary on 
extroverts and introverts: the 
party girl vs. Barnett. She sees the 
girl’s qualities as valuable. “You 
always get what you want,” she 
sings. After the chorus, her tone 
changes. “Why are you so eager 
to please?” She appreciates her 
own social style. The repetition of 
the chorus “I wanna go out, but 
I wanna stay home” closes the 
track. The conflicted persona she 
presents may be one of the most 

relatable of all time.

Dropped in her three-minute-

song-style is a pair of seven-minute 
tracks. Her crooning introspection 
on “Small Poppies” is balanced by 
a small dig: “I’m sure it’s a bore 
being you.” On “Small Poppies” 
and “Kim’s Caravan” Barnett is 
confused. “Small Poppies” dis-
plays that she simply (or compli-
catedly?) does not know who she 
is and searches for answers in 
her tumultuous relationship over 
rock-band-level guitars. In “Kim’s 
Caravan,” she likens the Great Bar-
rier Reef to a whore who has been 
raped out of greatness. Finally, she 
sees Jesus (whom she refers to as 
“she”) and runs out of things to say. 

Has she said everything already? 
Is she simply dumbfounded? Deal-
er’s choice.

The album closes with “Boxing 

Day Blues.” This track, specifically 
placed as the album’s finale, seems 
to be reflective of her work as a 
whole. Lines like “I know that I 
let you down / You’re not keen on 
what you found” are inferences 
on how listeners feel at the end of 
her work. Her parting words, “I’ve 
got no idea,” allow listeners to 
wait for her. Despite her feelings, 
it seems she has a wealth of ideas: 
some extremely poignant, others 
extremely mundane. Nonetheless, 
her ideas are worth hearing (and 
enjoying).

Daily Arts Writer

Temperatures hit a high last 

Monday, and my spirits skyrock-
eted alongside them. (Seriously, 
where did that 70 degree weather 
come from? And where did it go?) 
While it might not be summer 
quite yet, there is no stopping my 
Spotify 
playlists 
transforming 

from soothing, contemplative bal-
lads to summer songs. Yes, you 
know the ones — upbeat, dance-
able, sometimes obnoxious, songs 
reminiscent of Carly Rae Jepsen’s 
“Call Me Maybe” that will govern 
the radio for the next four months.

Named one of Nylon magazine’s 

South by Southwest Artists to 
Watch, HOLYCHILD is a front-
runner to dominate the summer 
song scene this year. Self-diag-
nosed as “brat pop,” the LA-based 
duo takes traditional pop music (or 
as traditional as pop music can be) 
and adds a sarcastic spin to its con-
struction, pairing experimental 
chords and an intense drumline to 
create an entirely new subsection 
of pop. A remix of HOLYCHILD’s 
most recent release, “Running 
Behind,” is currently featured the 
new Apple Watch commercial, 
allowing brat pop to take to televi-

sion screens across the nation.

HOLYCHILD, comprised of Liz 

Nistico and Louie Diller, formed 
when the pair met as juniors at 
George Washington University in 
Washington, D.C. With a sound 
similar to Icona Pop (whose love 
child with Charli XCX, “I Love It,” 
monopolized the summer of 2013), 
Nistico and Diller make music 
that should be listened to with the 
volume turned up and the win-
dows rolled down. It’s fun, sugary 
sweet and inventive in ways that 
haven’t been explored yet. “Run-
ning Behind,” characterized by 
powerful, steady percussion and 
looping choruses, sets the stage for 
these new methods and dictates 
the direction of HOLYCHILD’s 
vision. Although much of the focus 
remains on syncopated beats and 
repetitive electronic riffs, the 
sarcastic lyrics of “Playboy Girl” 
explore the unrealistic expecta-
tions placed on women in rela-
tionships. Despite its bubblegum 
pop sound, many of the songs on 
HOLYCHILD’s first EP MIND-
SPEAK indirectly address larger 
societal issues without alerting the 
casual listener.

These up-and-coming artists 

often take to their Twitter to 
interact with fans and express 

their desire to stay true to them-
selves amid the hectic journey to 
fame. While their authenticity is 
refreshing in a world primarily 
revolving around appearances, 
it’s also interesting to see the 
reflection of their personalities 
in their music. Liz and Louie’s 
rebellious tendencies frequently 
manifest themselves in their 
mocking lyrics, singing “I would 
lie if I say I did know / My true 
love and my silly symbol” in “Pre-
tend Believe.” Set to release their 
first full length album on Jun. 
2, HOLYCHILD’s The Shape of 
Brat Pop to Come will attempt to 
define this new genre and kick-
start the summer with catchy 
and innovative musical tech-
niques fit for the Top 40.

Some songs are meant to be 

summer songs. They aren’t ones 
that will be remembered in 50 
years or played in the back-
ground of a graduation slideshow 
(my mother was partial to Billy 
Joel’s “Vienna”), and that’s okay. 
These are songs that that you’ll 
find on that throwback playl-
ist and they’ll launch you back 
to that road trip or those nights 
in the park. This is exactly what 
HOLYCHILD strives to do — cre-
ate songs that make memories.

ETROIT — Red Berenson 
leans back in his chair 
with a scowl. He sips some 

water as he tries 
to process how 
the past hour 
could have left 
him smiling.

For the third 

straight season, 
he finds himself in

with the same 
discomfort and the 
same questions to 
answer. But that doesn’t make it any 
easier.

For the third straight season,

For the third straight season, it 

has been only one game — in fact, one 
period — that has kept the Michigan 
hockey team from receiving a bid to the 
NCAA Tournament.

Sometimes, even legends are 

defeated.

Berenson hasn’t been to the national 

tournament since 2012. Before that, 
he had led his team there for 22 
consecutive seasons.

His glossy eyes match his players’. 

It isn’t any easier for a 73-year old Hall

wrenching blow his team was dealt 
on Saturday — a 4-2 defeat against 

Minnesota in the Big Ten Tournament 
championship.

“He was pretty heartbroken like we 

were,” said freshman defenseman Zach 
Werenski.

Berenson didn’t say much to his team 

after the game. Words are tough to 
construct in a state of such heartbreak. 
There’s little you can say to the faces of 
grown men when those faces are coated 
with tears.

Even in his 31st season behind 

the Wolverine bench, Berenson is 
often stoic and stern. He would have 
welcomed a reason to smile after 
Saturday’s loss, but there wasn’t any.

When legends are
left empty-handed

Wolverines fall to Minnesota in 
Big Ten championship, end season 

without NCAA bid

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

DETROIT — Fair or not, the Michigan hockey team’s 

season has been defined by one play three seasons in 
a row. Not for glory or success, but for embodying a 
season that fell hairs short of expectations.

In 2013, it was an outstretched Steve Racine lunging 

for a shot while being pulled off the bench, only to have 
the puck fly into the net just out of reach, suddenly 
ending a streak of 22 consecutive NCAA Tournament 
trips.

Last year, it was the sight of a puck sitting right on 

the goal line, one inch from vaulting the Wolverines to 
an overtime win and a return to the NCAA Tournament 
that was eventually cleared away, just like Michigan’s 
dream of a postseason.

This year, things went quicker, but the sting of falling 

just short won’t go away any sooner.

Improving a quiet tournament

S

omething was wrong 
when, just 40 minutes 
before puck drop at Joe 

Louis Arena, 
the attendant 
at the box 
office scoffed 
when I asked 
if the game 
was any-
where near a 
sellout.

But it’s 

Michigan vs. 
Michigan 
State! And it’s the semifinal of 
the Big Ten Hockey Tournament, 
where the stakes are highest — 
the winner plays for a berth in 
the NCAA Tournament, and the 
loser sees its season end at the 
hand of a bitter rival. What could 
be better?

The attendant tried to talk 

me into paying extra for seats 
near the glass, but my friend 
and I wanted to be closer to the 
bands. So, with a pair of upper-
bowl tickets in hand, we walked 
up the stairs, through the metal 
detectors and onto the main 
concourse. There were no lines 
for food, at merchandise kiosks 
or at restrooms — and anyone 
who has been knows there’s 
always a line at the Joe.

We figured we might have 

some difficulty sitting where 
we wanted, but the only busy 
section at the arena was the 
one occupied by the Children 
of Yost, the Wolverines’ 
student supporters. Across 
the rink from them stood just 
three members of the A-Team, 
Michigan State’s equivalent.

And believe me, the Children 

of Yost noticed the attendance 
disparity.

“Where are your students?” 

they chanted. “Where’s the 
A-Team?”

The three Spartans waved 

back.

But this isn’t a dig at either 

school’s students, because the 
rest of the arena was mostly 
empty, too. This is a suggestion 
of how to fix a flawed Big Ten 
Tournament, because a premier 
conference’s most important 
contests shouldn’t be played in 
front of empty seats.

The biggest game of 

Michigan’s season didn’t 
feel like it at all. And that’s a 
problem.

I’ve traveled the northern 

United States covering hockey, 
men’s basketball and football, 
and no one is quite as crazy 
as hockey fans. They’ll stalk 
Tinder profiles (Michigan), 
throw a fish at your feet (New 
Hampshire), ring cowbells 
incessantly (Nebraska-Omaha) 
and everything in between just 
to rattle opponents.

In Columbus, the band forms 

Script Ohio on ice, while, in 
Ann Arbor, the referees toss 
candy into the stands — just 
two of the countless traditions 
unique to the sport.

Standing with the Children 

of Yost is the best atmosphere 
you’ll experience on campus. 
But at Joe Louis Arena, 
their chants were routinely 
drowned out by pop music 
or commercials blaring over 
loudspeakers. Even the Blues 
Brothers dance, a second-
intermission staple, was cut to 
only one round.

The game itself, a dominant 

4-1 victory for the Wolverines, 
exuded the chippiness and 
intensity of the rivalry. But the 
scattered fans couldn’t match 

that energy.

But it doesn’t have to be that 

way.

T

hree steps to improve 
the Big Ten Tourna-
ment

1) Don’t invite the 

conference’s worst teams.

Here’s a crazy thought: 

The 20-game Big Ten season 
should mean something. If 
a team is No. 6 in a six-team 
conference, it doesn’t deserve 
a chance to compete for an 
automatic berth to the NCAA 
Tournament. (Want that 
opportunity? Play better in the 
regular season!) Not only does 
this make for higher-quality 
hockey, but it also makes the 
end of the regular season more 
interesting. Suddenly, the end 
of February and the begging of 
March isn’t just a competition 
for first place — it’s a battle for 
fourth place and a crack at the 
postseason, too.

2) Play at campus sites.
In the 

current 
format, the 
top two seeds 
receive a first-
round bye. 
That’s not 
possible with 
a four-team 
tournament, 
so reward 
the regular 
season’s best 
teams by letting them host 
the semifinal games. The Big 
Ten has some great fans, and 
this is a good way to give the 
tournament the in-person 
support it deserves.

There would have been more 

than three Michigan State 
fans at Munn Ice Arena had 

the Spartans 
hosted 
Michigan in 
a semifinal. 
Minnesota’s 
hockey-
obsessed 
culture 
would’ve 
loved another 
home game as 
well.

The arenas 

would be packed, and the 
passion would be unrivaled. 
That’s what college hockey is 
all about.

3) Keep the final the way it is.
The Big Ten Tournament’s 

goal is to determine the 
conference’s best team, so let 
them do it at a neutral site. 
Right now, the final rotates 
annually between Minneapolis 
and Detroit, and it’s reasonable 
to keep it that way.

Under the new format, this 

year’s tournament would have 
featured:

Friday: No. 3 Michigan at No. 

2 Michigan State; No. 4 Penn 
State at No. 1 Minnesota

Sunday: Minnesota vs. 

Michigan at Joe Louis Arena

How much fun is that?

F

ifteen minutes before 
Friday’s puck drop, sta-
dium ushers invited my 

friend and me into the lower 
bowl — it didn’t matter what 
our tickets said.

So, for the most important 

night of both Michigan and 
Michigan State’s season, during 
a game played in the state of 
Michigan, I watched the third 
period from the fourth row. 
Nobody was sitting to my right 
or left, either.

And while I’ll never turn that 

deal down, I’d take a rowdy, 
sellout, true college hockey 
environment over better seats 
any day.

in the lack of alcoholic beverages

The biggest game 

of Michigan’s 

season didn’t feel 

like it at all.

Drexel tops ‘M’ at 
Michigan Stadium

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

After 60 minutes of play, 

the Michigan men’s lacrosse 
team walked off the field 
disappointed.

The Wolverines (4-4) fought 

hard but couldn’t overcome a 
go-ahead 
goal by the 
Dragons 
(3-5) 
in 

the final minutes of the game, 
losing 9-7.

“I really felt like we missed 

some 
opportunities 
today,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Paul. “We gave a few back that 
were unforced and that’s us 
continuing to work on our (stick 
handling). It’s also some of the 
decision-making process, when 
to push it when not to push it, 
those are some things that we 
need to get better at as well.”

The first quarter of the game 

saw only one goal, with Drexel 
converting on a rebound after 
redshirt sophomore goaltender 
Gerald Logan made an initial 
save.

The 
game 
escalated 

offensively 
in 
the 
second 

quarter with two more goals for 
the Dragons. Junior midfielder 
Mike 
Hernandez 
got 
the 

Wolverines on the scoreboard, 
though, with a bouncing shot 
midway through the quarter. 
Seconds later, Drexel responded 
with another goal to make the 
game 4-1 in its favor. However, 
junior faceoff specialist Brad 
Lott won the ensuing draw, 
which led to his team’s second 
goal, scored by junior attacker 
Peter Kraus.

“You have to take what they 

are giving to you, and today 
they were really focused on 
stopping our midfielders,” Paul 
said. “As soon as we realized 
that was what was going on we 
started talking about our attack 
really being more assertive and 
dodging hard on the re-dodge 
after our midfielders forced a 
slide.”

A second faceoff win in a row 

for Lott led to a goal for attacker 
Mike Francia. The senior scored 
on a fadeaway shot just outside 
the crease after receiving a pass 
from Kraus.

“I won every quarter except 

the third — I went 0-for-4 in the 

third, which was kind of big,” 
Lott said. “Every other quarter I 
was getting every single clamp. 
Later in the game he was slowly 
tying me up. If I could have 
gotten one or two more, I think 
we would have probably come 
out with a win.”

With less than six minutes 

to play in the half, the Dragons 
went a man down as a result 
of a holding penalty, and the 
Wolverines took advantage of 
the situation going back to the 
Francia-Kraus combination for 
the goal. Drexel added one last 
goal to take a 5-4 lead going into 
halftime.

Less than three minutes into 

the second half, the Dragons put 
one on the board after they had 
worked the ball around well on 
their offensive end. Michigan 
responded with a Kraus wrap-
around goal from behind the 
net, and minutes later, senior 
midfielder Will Meter scored 
an almost exact replica of the 
previous goal.

Tied heading into the final 

quarter, Drexel went ahead on a 
goal with 8:09 left in the game. 
However, the Wolverines tied 
it right back up on a goal from 
Francia, who completed his 
hat trick with an intelligent cut 
to the front of the net where 
redshirt 
junior 
midfielder 

David Joseph found him with 
the pass.

With just 4:21 remaining in 

the game the Dragons scored 
what turned out to be the go 
ahead goal. Drexel won the 
following faceoff and was able 
to run two minutes off the clock 
without Michigan touching the 
ball.

As soon as the Wolverines 

gained possession of the ball, a 
timeout was called in order to 
prepare for the attempt to tie 
the game. Out of the timeout, 
Michigan moved the ball well 
around the offensive box, but 
eventually lost control of the 
ball.

“We saw that they were in 

zone and we have plays and 
formations to kind of work 
against that zone,” Francia 
said. “In that kind of game it 
gets pretty hectic as you can 
imagine, with time winding 
down. We just have to connect 
on the little things and I think it 
would have gone our way.”

Michigan dominates 

Ohio State in 

Columbus for three-

game sweep

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Three 
wins 
away 
from 

becoming just the third coach in 
college softball history to reach 
1,400 victories, Michigan softball 
coach Carol Hutchins needed an 
undefeated weekend to etch her 
name further into the record 
books. And with three games 
against Ohio State, Hutchins 
and the Wolverines would not be 
denied the milestone.

Michigan 
dominated 
the 

Buckeyes, sweeping them with 
scores of 13-1, 13-1 and 20-0.

“Ohio State is a very good 

hitting team, and they’re very 
athletic,” Hutchins said. “I was 
very pleased to only give up two 
runs. We did a great job of taking 
a lot of free pitches, and we did 
a really nice job of taking good 
at-bats. The key was getting 
base runners and having timely 
hitting.”

The series opened Michigan’s 

Big Ten season, and on Friday, 
the Wolverines sent a message to 
the rest of the conference. Their 
performance — the only win 
not achieved by run rule — was 
highlighted by sophomore right-
hander Megan Betsa’s lights-out 
pitching. She tallied a career-
high 14 strikeouts in a complete-
game win.

“The highlight of the weekend 

was Megan Betsa having one 
walk in both of the games that 
she threw,” Hutchins said. “She’s 
worked really hard on her game 
and her pitches, but it’s really a 
matter of gaining confidence at 
what you work at and not getting 
caught up in the outcome or your 
opponent.”

Added Betsa: “I just focused on 

getting ahead of the batters and 

keeping the hitters off balance.”

Betsa didn’t need much run 

support, but the offense gave 
her 
plenty 

of 
cushion 

regardless. 
The 
offensive 

onslaught was 
bolstered 
by 

home 
runs 

from 
junior 

rightfielder 
Kelsey Susalla, 
catcher 
Aidan 
Falk, 

junior 
second 

baseman Sierra Romero and 
freshman 
infielder 
Taylor 

Swearingen.

Saturday was almost a mirror 

image of Friday’s contest for the 
Wolverines, as Michigan won 
by the same score, tallying four 
home runs and 12 walks.

Four minutes into the game, 

after a walk and a hit batter, 
Romero sent her 13th home run 
over the stands. Also flexing their 

muscles by way of the long ball 
were junior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence, 
junior 
rightfielder 

Kelsey Susalla 
and freshman 
infielder 
Amanda 
Vargas. 
Vargas’ third-
inning 
home 

run 
was 
a 

grand 
slam 

and her first 
collegiate 
homer.

With 

Hutchins’ standing on 1,399 
wins, 
Michigan 
entered 

Sunday’s contest with more to 
play for than just a win over its 
rival.

And the Wolverines came out 

on fire, scoring 20 runs to match 
a season high. Betsa got early 
run support by way of a six-run 
first inning and a 10-run second. 
Michigan also hit five home runs 
in the series finale, all by the 

freshmen. Vargas and infielder 
Taylor Swearingen each knocked 
out two, and catcher Aidan Falk 
hit one of her own. Betsa again 
racked up strikeouts, earning 
nine. She ended the fifth and 
final inning on nine pitches, 
sealing Hutchins’ 1,400th win 
nicely.

After 
the 
game, 
the 

Wolverines had a short-lived 
celebration, taking a team photo 
commemorating 
Hutchins’ 

record victory.

But 
to 
everyone 
in 
the 

Michigan locker room, especially 
Hutchins, the milestone is not 
the focus.

Hutchins 
took 
her 
team 

picture and then moved on, 
focusing on what she can do 
better for next week’s games. 
She’s not being boastful about 
her accomplishment. She sets an 
example with not just her record, 
but her philosophy. As soon as the 
game is over, she’s thinking about 
how to beat who’s next.

Hutchins earns 1,400th win

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins surpassed another career milestone in her team’s sweep of Ohio State.

“I just focused 

on getting 
ahead of the 

batters.”

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

In college athletics, games 

between conference opponents 
tend to bring a greater intensity, 
especially 
as 
teams 
vie 
for 

postseason seeds and bragging 
rights against their most bitter 
rivals. Conference games often 
represent the hardest part of 
a 
team’s 
schedule, 
requiring 

another level of mental fortitude 
and physical toughness.

After this past weekend, the 

Michigan baseball team will need 
to reassess the intensity with 
which it comes to fight for the 
remainder of the Big Ten season.

Michigan 

(0-3 Big Ten, 
11-11 overall) 
began Big Ten 
play with a 
three-game 
series against 
Nebraska. In 
the series, the 
Wolverines were outscored 25-7 
and compiled a dreary .260 team 
batting average. The pitching 
staff allowed the Cornhuskers 
(3-0, 17-6) to score at least one run 
in each first inning of the series, 
and Michigan was always playing 
from behind, and, ultimately, was 
soundly swept.

The shutdown in both offensive 

and defensive production came as 
a surprise to the Wolverines, who 
had previously won nine of their 
last 12 games and looked to be 
finding their groove on both sides 
of the ball.

In Lincoln, though, Michigan 

was 
badly 
unprepared. 
In 

Friday’s matchup, a 14-3 defeat, 
the Wolverines committed three 
errors and were already trailing 
by five after the first frame.

Saturday, Michigan stranded 

nine runners on base in a 
lackadaisical 6-1 loss.

And 
on 
Sunday, 
as 
the 

Wolverines looked to salvage 
some positive from an otherwise 
traumatic weekend, a four-run 
seventh inning broke open a 2-1 
nail-biter and gave Nebraska a 
lead it would not relinquish, as it 
went on to beat Michigan, 6-3.

Though Michigan coach Erik 

Bakich was unable to find any 
positives from the weekend’s 
losses, he believes that his team 
will find a fighter’s instinct to 
keep trudging on.

“It’s just like getting knocked 

down — you get back up,” Bakich 
said. “We’re down, but we’re not 
out. And we have to get back up, 
we have to get tougher, we have 
to find a way to have some more 

fight.”

Tuesday, 

the Wolverines 
hope 
to 

rediscover 
some 
of 
the 

success 
they 

were 
having 

before 
this 

fateful trip to Lincoln, as they 
play their first home game of the 
season against Bowling Green.

While 
Bakich 
is 
looking 

forward to playing on his own 
grounds for the first time this 
year, he does not believe that 
having to travel is a valid excuse 
for such a hapless display of effort 
as the one shown in Lincoln.

“It’s good to play at home 

because you get to compete in 
front of your own fans, there are 
a lot of positives that come with 
playing at home,” Bakich said. 
“But we’re not building in excuses 
for playing 22 straight games on 
the road, either.”

For a team that is looking to use 

this season as an opportunity to 
compete on the highest level and 
to win tangible results, perhaps 
this 
series 
against 
Nebraska 

served 
as 
a 
welcoming, 
an 

invitation into what it means to 
play winning baseball.

“We’re down, but 

we’re not out.”

Five total wrestlers 
earn All-American 

honors, led by 

heavyweight Coon

By MICHAEL GRIFFIN

Daily Sports Writer

It was the end of the overtime 

period at the NCAA heavyweight 
wrestling semifinal, and Adam 
Coon was on top of the world.

He had just defeated Mike 

McMullen 
of 
Northwestern 

with a crushing pin as the clock 
expired. As Coon climbed off 
his opponent, pumped his fist 
and raised his arms, his coach, 
Joe 
McFarland, 
stood 
and 

cheered.

A day later, as the NCAA 

Wrestling 
Championships 

drew to a close, and Michigan 
had secured its place as the 
11th-best team in the country, 
Joe McFarland spoke about 
his team’s performance with 
similar emotion.

“I’m real proud of our guys,” 

he said. “I felt that we did a great 
job of carrying our momentum 
into the national tournament. 
Then to have half of our guys 
make 
All-American, 
that’s 

something special.”

This 
year’s 
NCAA 

Championships were a huge 
step in the right direction for a 
team in the middle of a wrestling 
renaissance. Michigan ended 
the meet with five wrestlers 
earning All-American honors, 
matching the team’s second-
best showing in its 94-year 
history.

Adding to the impressive 

performance 
was 
the 
fact 

that the Wolverines achieved 
it with a team led mostly by 
underclassmen. Nine of the 
10 wrestlers at nationals will 
return next year. Even more 
impressively, 
every 
single 

All-American 
matched 
or 

surpassed the expectations set 
in seeding.

Sophomore 
Adam 
Coon, 

team captain and a standout all 
year, entered the tournament 
seeded No. 6, then advanced 
to 
the 
championship 
final. 

Despite tying the score at six 
late in the third period against 
the 
defending 
champion, 

North Carolina State’s Nick 
Gwiazdowski, he was unable 
to come away with the victory, 
losing 
7-6. 
Gwiazdowski 

secured 
the 
lead 
with 
15 

seconds left on the clock, 
escaping Coon’s hold.

Nonetheless, McFarland was 

extremely pleased with his star.

“He really fought through 

these past two days to get to 
the 
championship 
match,” 

McFarland 
said. 
“He 
was 

disappointed that he didn’t get 
the win, but I thought it was a 
great effort, 
and a great 
season.”

Several 

other 
wrestlers 
finished 
in 
the 
top 

10 
of 
their 

respective 
events. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
and 

team co-captain Max Huntley, 
who was coming off of a fifth-
place finish at the Big Ten 
Championships, came in eighth, 
earning All-American honors 
for the first time in his Michigan 
career.

McFarland praised Huntley, 

who has captained the team 
for two years and has spent 
the season regaining the edge 
lost last year to a torn pectoral 
muscle.

“We’re really going to miss 

his leadership,” McFarland said. 
“When you have a guy like that 
come into your program, and 
then after four years he comes 
out and has a year like this, 

that’s really great to see.”

Redshirt sophomore Conor 

Youtsey, who wrestles at 125 
pounds, entered the tournament 
unseeded, 
but 
advanced 
to 

the fifth-place match, where 
he lost to Nahshon Garrett 
of Cornell but secured sixth 
place and All-American honors. 
Youtsey was perhaps the biggest 
surprise of the tournament 
for the Wolverines, as the only 
one of four unseeded Michigan 
wrestlers to advance past the 
first round.

Brian Murphy, a sophomore 

wrestling at 157 pounds, locked 
up seventh place and his first 
All-American honor with a win 
by forfeit over Lehigh’s Mitch 
Minotti. He finishes up an 
exceptional season in which he 
was 7-2 in dual meet competition 
and placed fifth at the Big Ten 
Championships.

The 
final 

All-American 
was 
Rossi 

Bruno, 
the 

group’s 
lone 
junior, 

who 
ended 

the 
meet 

eighth 
with 

a 4-3 record. 
Bruno, 
who 

missed 
earning All-

American honors by one match 
last year, finished the season 
strong despite being injured for 
most of the dual meets.

While the other five wrestlers 

Michigan sent to St. Louis did 
not come away with honors, the 
number of wrestlers that the 
team sent to the tournament 
was 
an 
accomplishment 
in 

itself. There were 10 Wolverines 
at the NCAA Championships 
compared to eight last year.

Perhaps more importantly, 

however, all but one of those 
who qualified will return to the 
team next year, giving Michigan 
an early edge to compete for a 
national title next season.

‘M’ to face Toledo in WNIT

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is still alive.

After 
defeating 
Cleveland 

State 
in 
the 

first round of 
the 
WNIT, 

Michigan 
will 
travel 

to Toledo to 
take 
on 
the 

Rockets 
on 

Monday night 
in the second 
round of the 
tournament.

The 

Wolverines 
(8-10 Big Ten, 17-14 overall) 
are coming off a convincing 
71-50 win over the Vikings 
on Wednesday night in which 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
used 
an 
unorthodox 

method to pick her starting 
lineup.

She 
used 
a 
points-based 

system to reward players for 
their work during the week 
leading up to the game.

At the end of the week, 

freshman 
forward 
Emoni 

Jackson held the No. 5 spot in 
the points standings, earning 
her first start of her collegiate 
career.

And 
Barnes 
Arico’s 

unorthodox method paid off, as 
Jackson totaled eight points and 
four rebounds in 14 minutes of 

action.

“She’s just got a little bounce 

on her,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She was able to rebound the 
basketball extremely well and 
just find a way to finish plays 
around the basket. She gave us a 
great lift, and I was really happy 
for her.”

Michigan’s 
defense 
shut 

down Cleveland State, which 
shot a paltry 25.9 percent in the 
first half, scoring just 20 points.

Senior forward Cyesha Goree 

returned to her double-digit 
scoring form, finishing with 
18 points after scoring just a 
combined seven points in her 
last two games.

Even with her successful 

experiment, 
Barnes 
Arico 

acknowledged that her regular 
starters — senior guard Shannon 
Smith, sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson and freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty — would have 
big parts in the Wolverines’ next 
game.

But Barnes Arico was happy 

with her squad’s depth.

“Siera and Shannon have 

proved 
themselves 
all 
year 

long,” Barnes Arico said. “We’ll 
have to sit down and we’ll 
evaluate the next couple days 
and kind of see what happens, 
but it’s nice to have that depth 
and to be able to have to make 
those decisions, which are great 
decisions as a coach to have to 
make.”

For 
Toledo 
(11-9 
Mid-

American Conference, 19-13), 
guard Inma Zanoguera leads 
the Rockets in scoring with 15.4 
points per game. She also leads 
the team in boards, averaging 
6.7 rebounds.

Five years ago, the two 

opponents found themselves in 
the exact same position.

Michigan and Toledo faced 

off in the second round of 
the WNIT in 2010, when the 
Wolverines used a 21-2 run out 
of the halftime break to win 
72-57 and advance to the round 
of 16.

That Michigan team went on 

to semifinals before bowing out 
to Miami.

The 
Wolverines 
and 
the 

Rockets have faced five of the 
same opponents this season 
in Purdue, Detroit, Eastern 
Michigan, Cleveland State and 
Western Michigan. Michigan is 
a combined 5-0 against the five 
squads, while Toledo is 3-5.

The winner of the game will 

face Missouri in the round of 16 
after the Tigers defeated Kansas 
State, 67-48, on Sunday.

But 
to 
get 
to 
Missouri, 

Michigan will have to tame 
a 
rowdy 
Toledo 
crowd 
— 

average attendance at Rockets 
games is over 3,500. Winning 
won’t be easy, considering the 
Wolverines are just 4-10 away 
from home.

But if Michigan wants its 

postseason to continue, it’s 
going to have do just that.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

reporters, Berenson walked 
straight to the team bus. He sat 
there as his team filed out of the 
locker room, heads down and 
optimism dashed. Berenson 
sat in the front of the bus as 
thoughts on another season 
of underachievement rushed 
through his head.

Hardly anyone takes losing as 

hard as Berenson does.

“You know what, I went 

through that three-year stretch 
where we didn’t make it,” said 
Minnesota coach Don Lucia. 
“You don’t even want to watch 
the NCAA Tournament because 
you’re bummed out, because 
you’re competitive, and Red is as 
competitive as anybody else.”

Berenson has said he would 

be the first to step down if he 
thought he couldn’t lead the 
Michigan hockey program to its 
full potential. The team means 
too much for him not to.

But his coaching ability hasn’t 

faded. The Wolverines needed 
their best weekend of hockey 
to have a chance at winning 
the Big Ten Tournament and, 
defensively, they got that.

In the final month of the 

season, Berenson pushed his 
team to buy into a defensive 
philosophy that was lacking 
beforehand. Following a 
disheartening loss to Ohio State 
on Feb. 20, Berenson called a 
team meeting.

The Wolverines’ defense 

was in flames, and Berenson’s 
message was simple — play better 
without the puck. It took time 
for the team to buy in, but it 
bought in this weekend, when it 
mattered most.

Berenson preaches defense, and 

he preaches work ethic. His team 
played through the philosophy 
of its legendary coach. The effort 
was there, the desperation was 
there and the defensive corps was 
consistently stout for the first time 
in a long time.

Winning and losing are 

separated by the smallest of 
margins. The dichotomy between 
how a person feels after winning 

and how a person feels after 
losing, however, is immense.

“Very few teams and 

individuals get to finish their 
season on a winning note,” said 
undergraduate assistant coach 
Mike Komisarek. “So, that’s 
where we want to be, and that’s 
where we want to get at.”

And Berenson will be a part of 

it. The 73-year old coach has one 
year remaining on his contract, 
and he has admitted he thinks 
about retirement a lot.

But this is not the summer 

that Berenson walks away from 
what he’s most passionate about. 
He loves coaching because he 
loves competition, but he loves 
coaching most when he gets to 
watch his young players grow as 
people and as hockey players.

“Our team really came up 

and our young guys came up,” 
Berenson said. “I mean, who 
would have thought (Cutler) 
Martin would be playing regular, 
the way he has, as an unknown 
coming in and so on. I could go 
through our lineup, and it wasn’t 
just the freshmen, it was the 
seniors as well.”

As a man of few words, 

Berenson likely won’t express 
how much this weekend stings, 
nor will he admit how long it 

might sting for. He’s used to being 
at the top of the hockey world. 
This is an uncomfortable and 
unfamiliar position for a coach of 
his stature.

He has won two national 

championships with Michigan, 
coached dozens of NHL players 
and created a program built on 
hard work and integrity.

After Saturday’s game, 

Berenson insisted the podium 
wasn’t his to take, though it 
has been his for the taking 
throughout his entire career.

“Look, I don’t want to take 

any more time,” he said. “This 
podium should be for the 
winners, OK? Thank you.”

He then sauntered out of the 

room as a coach whose season 
ended prematurely and as a 
legend who has been left empty-
handed. There wasn’t anything 
left to say anyway.

Berenson had his chance to 

speak at the loser’s podium, but 
he’s more comfortable in the 
winner’s circle. He’ll have to wait 
a year before he gets back, but 
there’s little chance Berenson 
won’t speak as a victor once more.

Hyman’s career 
ends painfully

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

DETROIT — Zach Hyman 

entered the press room after 
Saturday’s loss teary-eyed, but 
understandably so.

He knew his season was over. 

He knew his Michigan career 
was over. He knew his incredible 
year, one in which he tallied 
22 goals and notched over 50 
points, had ended sooner than he 
planned.

And he knew that his time 

playing next to freshman Dylan 
Larkin — the other half of the 
team’s dynamic duo — was done.

Michigan coach Red Berenson 

found solace, though, knowing 
that Hyman did everything he 
possibly could to extend the 
Wolverines’ season.

“You could see how he drove 

the net and he had a guy on his 
back,” Berenson said of Hyman’s 
goal on Saturday. “He just 
powered through the trap to the 
front of the net, and then beat the 
goalie. He singlehandedly tried 
to take the team on his back, and 
he’s been doing that all year.

“It’s been a pleasure for me to 

coach him and watch him emerge 
as the player he’s become, and as 
a person and so on.”

Hyman was the centerpiece 

of this Michigan hockey team. 
When the team needed a goal, 
Hyman was there. When the team 
needed a talking-to for lackluster 
play, Hyman was there. But now, 
Hyman won’t be there anymore, 
at least while wearing a Michigan 
hockey sweater.

“I’m upset because my career 

is over here,” Hyman said before 
taking a big gulp of water. “I’m 
not upset because of the way we 
played.”

Still, the atmosphere in the 

locker room after the game was 
one each Michigan player will 
remember forever, and not for 
the 
right 
reason. 
Freshman 

defenseman Zach Werenski had 
never experienced such sorrow 
on his teammates’ faces.

“I can’t say I have,” said 

freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 

Werenski. “The locker room, it was 
devastating. It was very hitting in 
the locker room, seeing the seniors’ 
faces. It’s not what you want to do. 
It’s not what you see.”

And for Michigan, it was 

especially hard to see Hyman’s 
sorrow. 
Mike 
Komisarek, 

Michigan’s 
newest 
assistant 

coach who played two seasons for 
the Wolverines before a 11-year 
career in the NHL, expressed 
a similar sentiment, noting the 
future is bright for not only 
Hyman, but for Michigan.

More 
notably, 
Komisarek 

emphasized that a team can 
rebound 
from 
such 
a 
gut-

wrenching blow.

“Very 
few 
teams 
and 

individuals get to finish their 
season on a winning note,” he 
said. “I think you never forget 
the 
feeling 
coming 
off 
the 

ice, watching the other team 
celebrate, or hearing them from 
the locker room through the 
walls. It’s something you use for 
fuel and motivation.”

Werenski, who is arguably 

Michigan’s 
best 
defenseman, 

knows he will hear about this 
game for some time, adding to 
any motivation he already has for 
next season.

The 17-year-old has multiple 

friends that play for Minnesota. 
Defenseman Ryan Collins was 
one of them. He and Werenski 
played for Team USA together, 
most recently at the World Junior 
Championships in late December.

Werenski 
and 
Collins 

coincidentally exited the Joe 
Louis Arena at the same time 
through the same door. That 
meeting could’ve been tough for 
Werenski, knowing a close friend 
ended his impressive freshman 
campaign.

But Werenski and Collins 

hugged, and no hatred was 
spewed. Werenski knows he’ll 
have another chance to get the 
last laugh, even though it will 
take some time to crack a smile.

Michigan wins Big Ten title

Second-highest 
score in program 

history earns 
championship

By CINDY YU

Daily Sports Writer

At the Big Ten Championships, 

the No. 6 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team embodied the 
quartz-themed leotards senior 
Sachi Sugiyama designed.

As the most recognized type 

of crystal, quartz symbolizes 
power, energy and clarity.

“The 
stone 
epitomizes 

teamwork 
and 
transforms 

negative energy into positive 
energy, and that we were going 
to be strong and have clarity,” 
Sugiyama said.

Indeed, 
the 
Wolverines 

lived up to their expectations, 
resembling the powerful stone.

Michigan (18-0 Big Ten, 21-2 

overall) dominated the Big Ten 
Championships with a season-
best team total of 197.825, the 
second-highest score in program 
history. Already the winningest 
program 
in 
the 
conference, 

this 
achievement 
Saturday 

inside Crisler Center marks the 
Wolverines’ 23rd Big Ten title.

“It’s just such a chilling 

experience,” 
said 
sophomore 

Nicole Artz. “We were brought 
to tears at the end.”

Artz 
won 
the 
all-around 

title with a career-best score 
of 39.650, and Sugiyama and 
freshman 
Brianna 
Brown 

matched 
their 
career-high 

scores of 39.550 to tie for fourth. 
Brown was named Big Ten 
Co-Freshman of the Year, and 
Plocki was named Big Ten Coach 
of the Year. And to top it off, 
Artz, Sugiyama, Brown, junior 
Briley Casanova and sophomore 
Talia Chiarelli were named to 
the All-Big Ten Championships 
team.

“This was by far the best meet 

in all four events that we’ve had 
so far this season,” Plocki said. 
“Hopefully, we’re just hitting our 
stride right now, and we can carry 
this into regionals and nationals.”

Beginning 
with 
a 
bye, 

Michigan 
listened 
to 
Bo 

Schembechler’s 
“The 
Team, 

The Team, The Team” speech 
during the first rotation. As the 
team emerged from the tunnel 
to march to its first event of the 
evening, the gymnasts walked 
out to a standing ovation from 
the fans.

Fired up, the Wolverines set 

the tone on the floor exercise, 
delivering the top floor rotation 
of the day.

Sugiyama 
and 
Chiarelli 

led the team with their 9.925 
performances, tying Minnesota 
gymnast Lindsay Mable for first 
place on the event. Sugiyama 
matched her career best for the 
fourth consecutive week, while 
Chiarelli rebounded from an 
uncharacteristically low 9.675 
routine the previous meet.

“This 
was 
kind 
of 

redemption,” Chiarelli said. “To 
be able to do a good floor routine 
in front of a big crowd is really 
fun and exciting.”

Artz 
was 
also 
a 
major 

contributor to the floor lineup, 
earning a score of 9.900 to share a 
fourth-place finish with Nebraska 
gymnast Hollie Blanske.

After the completion of one 

event, Michigan narrowly led 
No. 16 Illinois, 49.450-49.400.

“Our goal was to come out of 

the gate really strong, and I think 
we did that on floor,” Plocki said.

Moving 
to 
vault, 
the 

Wolverines 
gained 
upward 

momentum, as all six gymnasts 
in the lineup scored at least 
9.850. It was evident that their 
focus on sticking in practice this 
week translated to competition.

“I think this was our best 

vaulting of the season,” Plocki 
said.

As she did on floor, Chiarelli 

led the team on vault. Her 
powerful Yurchenko full with 
just a small hop back on the 
landing earned a 9.900, enough 
to tie her career best from the 
first meet of the season.

At the halfway point, Michigan 

and Illinois were neck and neck, 
with the Wolverines carrying a 
slim 98.850-98.825 lead.

After another bye, Michigan 

had its best rotation of the season 
on bars, scoring 49.525. Artz tied 
her career best of 9.950 to win 
a share of the Big Ten title with 
Nebraska’s Jennie Laeng.

When Artz stuck her double 

layout 
dismount, 
cheering 

erupted from all around Crisler. 
She even earned a second round 
of applause when a judge flashed 
a perfect 10.

Brown, ranked in the top five 

in the nation on bars, earned a 
9.925 to tie for third.

Leading by just 0.275 points 

going into the final rotation, 
Casanova set the standard in the 
leadoff position on beam. In her 
wobble-free routine, she tied her 
season-best score of 9.900 and 
finished second on the event, 
even despite illness.

“Briley was sick as a dog,” 

Plocki said. “But she was a 
superstar.”

Brown was also able to match 

Casanova’s score for a spot on 
the podium.

The highlight of the night 

came from Artz, who tied 
another career best and scored 
her second 9.950 point total to 
win the event outright. When 
she stuck her one-and-a-half 
twisting dismount, both her 
teammates and the fans held up 
10 fingers to show approval.

At the conclusion of the meet, 

Michigan had widened its gap 
over Illinois to 0.575.

“I was just incredibly proud 

of all of these young ladies to 
handle that pressure the way 
they did, and to not just hit beam 
but rock beam,” Plocki said. “All 
season long, I’ve known these 
are tough competitors, but this is 
a different level.

“This is the level that’s going 

to take us into the national 
championship and get on the 
podium.”

Red Berenson’s season ended without an NCAA Tournament berth again.

off a Band-Aid, the puck bounced 
right out of the empty net, but 
the damage had been done. 
With 34 seconds left in the Big 
Ten championship game, the 
Wolverines (12-8 Big Ten, 22-15 
overall) got the dagger they have 
grown all too familiar with. 
Minnesota netted its fourth goal 
of the night en route to a 4-2 win.

“From our perspective, it was a 

great college hockey game,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. “I 
was proud of our team. I thought 
they played hard and that they 
played well, just not well enough.”

When the Wolverines cruised 

through the Big Ten Tournament, 
outscoring 
Wisconsin 
and 

Michigan State, 9-1, en route to 
the final, it seemed that Michigan 
would play well enough, and 
a triumphant return to the 
postseason was simply destiny.

The team had stumbled to 

its worst start since 1986, but 
rebounded in incredible fashion. 
Led by breakout senior forward 
Zach Hyman and his linemate, 
freshman upstart Dylan Larkin, 
the 
Wolverines 
became 
the 

nation’s 
top 
offense, 
posting 

blowout scores while masking 
an inexperienced and developing 
defense in the process.

But with its back to the wall 

at Joe Louis Arena, it looked like 
things would click for Michigan, it 
really did. Against Wisconsin and 
Michigan State, the Wolverines 
came out swinging, outshooting 
and outscoring both teams by 
comical margins.

Saturday, 
it 
became 
clear 

it wouldn’t be as easy. The 
experienced and deep Minnesota 
team 
dominated 
possession, 

outshooting the Wolverines, 20-7, 
in the first period and testing the 
defense like never before this 
season.

But Racine and the defense 

were 
there 
for 
every 
shot, 

quieting the doubters, and, more 
importantly, setting the tone 
for the game when the offense 
couldn’t.

Things changed quite quickly 

in the second, however. After 

earning a power play, Minnesota’s 
Travis Boyd parked by the right 
post. After about a minute, the 
puck found him, and the senior 
buried it to give the Gophers an 
early lead.

But as he has countless times 

throughout the season, Hyman 
responded by putting the team on 
his shoulders. Skating from the 
boards deep in Minnesota’s zone 
less than 90 seconds later during 
a power play, the Big Ten scoring 
champion threaded across the 
ice, 
skirting 
through 
three 

Gopher defenders before firing a 
highlight-reel 
shot so baffling 
that netminder 
Adam Wilcox 
had to sit in 
disbelief while 
Hyman 
woke 

up 
fans 
and 

teammates 
alike 
in 

celebration.

“He just powered through the 

trap to the front of the net and 
then beat the goalie like he single-
handedly tried to take the team 
on his back,” Berenson said. “He’s 
been doing that all year, and it’s 
been a pleasure for me to coach 
him and watch him emerge as the 
player he’s become.”

As the only members of the 

Michigan 
hockey 
team 
who 

have ever played in the NCAA 
Tournament, Hyman and his 
fellow seniors knew what was 
at stake Saturday, and wouldn’t 
imagine anything less than the 
biggest effort of their careers.

“It’s definitely the biggest game 

of my career here, one game to 
win a championship, it couldn’t 
be better than this,” Hyman said 
Friday. “If you win a Big Ten 
Championship, you have a chance 
at a national championship, it 
doesn’t get bigger than that.”

They refused to go down easily. 

Two and a half minutes later, 
sophomore forward Alex Kile 
found twine as the final leg in a 
tic-tac-toe goal. Though Wilcox 
followed the development of the 
play, the 2014 Big Ten Player of the 
Year was unable to track the work 
of the sharpshooting sophomore.

With a 2-1 lead and a largely 

favorable crowd in the stands 

above it, Michigan looked to be 
clicking in all areas of the game. 
Even Racine — who took turns 
with sophomore netminder Zach 
Nagelvoort 
at 
thriving, 
then 

struggling all season — continued 
to look as good as ever, making 
a highlight-reel save on a 2-on-1 
Minnesota breakaway, one of 30 
saves on the night.

Minnesota found more luck 

just past the halfway point of the 
second period however, when 
forward Kyle Rau, fresh out of 
a visit to the penalty box, broke 
through 
Racine 
on 
another 

dazzling one-
timer, 
giving 

Minnesota 
a 

new sense of 
purpose.

Eventually, 

one 
of 

Michigan’s 
less-than-
desirable 
staples 
— 

a defensive miscue — led to 
the team’s demise. With two 
defensemen preoccupied on a hit 
during a Minnesota power play 
early in the third period, Gopher 
forward 
Justin 
Kloos 
found 

himself open, or open enough, to 
score the go-ahead goal.

“We 
had 
our 
chances,” 

Berenson said. “We needed to 
capitalize on one of those chances 
to get the go-ahead goal, and we 
couldn’t get it, and sure enough, 
they did.”

A flurry of attacks by the 

feared 
and 
revered 
offense 

came at Wilcox, but to no avail. 
Eventually Racine was pulled, 
but it didn’t take long for the 
puck to travel the length of 
the ice, extending Michigan’s 
tournament drought, cutting the 
Wolverines’ season short and 
robbing Hyman of destiny in the 
process.

“We showed up,” said junior 

forward Andrew Copp. “We had 
the right attitude and mentality. 
Thursday and Friday were pretty 
good days for us, and we were 
pretty confident going into today 
just to keep the momentum 
rolling. The bounces just didn’t go 
our way. We didn’t play our best, 
but we felt like we played good 
enough to win.”
