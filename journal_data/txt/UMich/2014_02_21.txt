By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily Staff Reporter
At their meeting on Thursday, the
University's Board of Regents unan-
imously voted to commence ahost of
construction projects with project-
ed costs of more than $510 million.
The projects span across campus,
including the construction of a new
300,000-square-foot Biological Sci-
ence Building and renovations of the
older sections of the Ross School of
Business, West Quad Residence Hall
and the historic President's House.
Regents approve constructionof a
new Biological S cience Building
The construction of the Biological
Sciences Building - the project that
will bring about the biggest change
to the landscape of Central Campus
- will cost an estimated $261 mil-
lion. Funding will come from LSA
and Office of the Provost resources.
The BSB will be built adjacent to
the Life Sciences Institute, on the
site of the historic North Hall and
the Museums Annex, both of which
will be demolished.
The new facility will include new
research laboratories, offices, class-
rooms and vivarium services, and
will adopt portions of the four muse-
um collections currently housed in
the Ruthven Museums Building.
Additionally, the new BSB will con-
nect to the Life Sciences Institute,

IFC restricts type
of alcohol allowed

Policy shift will
prohibit hard
liquor at large
fraternity events
ByYARDAINAMRON
Daily StaffReporter
Some fraternity parties will
now be a little easier on the
liver.
In a nearly unanimous vote
Wednesday night, the Inter-
fraternity Council amended its
Social Environment Manage-
ment Policy to ban hard liquor
at fraternities' open parties.
The new policy will be effective
immediately.
Business senior Michael

Proppe, Central Student
Government president, first
announced the policy change at
the meeting of the University's
Board of Regents Thursday.
"This is a proactive step that
Michigan students are taking
to improve our safety on cam-
pus, and I commend the IFC
leadership," Proppe said.
The new policy comes less
than two months into IFC
President Tommy Wydra's first
term as the organization's lead-
er. Proppe said Wydra is getting
off to a successful start.
The SEMP amendment
applies to Tier IIIA and Tier
IIIB parties, known as "open
parties," which are limited
to 200 guests, along with the
hosting fraternity members.
"Due to the elimination of

hard liquor at Tier IIIA and
IIIB events, students will enjoy
a safer social scene at the Uni-
versity of Michigan for years to
come," the IFC stated ina press
release.
The policy will not apply to
National Pan-Hellenic Council
or Multicultural Greek Coun-
cil parties because SEMP only
applies to the IFC and Pan-Hel-
lenic Association.
Wydra said the new policy
extends only to open par-
ties and not lower-tier parties
because the former tend to be
the riskiest, such as those dur-
ing Welcome Week or on Hal-
loween.
"Many of the Greeks get so
much training, whether it's

University President
says administration
has refocused on
increasing diversity
By YARDAIN AMRON and
CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporters
At Thursday's meeting of the
University's Board of Regents,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman opened with a lengthy
speech addressing campus
diversity, climate and inclu-
sion. As she spoke, members
of the Black Student Union sat
in the front row with duct tape
over their mouths that read "Go
Blue!"
In the address, Coleman
cited the University's role in the
two 2003 Supreme Court cases
addressing affirmative action
as one of the proudest moments
during her presidency. In Grut-
ter v. Bollinger, the court upheld
the University's consideration
of race in admissions as part of
a holistic review of each candi-
date.
"At the time, many people
asked why the University was
taking on such a divisive issue
in such a public way," Coleman
said. "My answer was always the
same: It was the right thing to

do. It was a long, difficult strug-
gle, it was hard on many levels,
and it was the right thing to do."
Coleman said the University's
struggle to make progress in
increasing diversity is troubling.
She ascribed part of the chal-
lenge to the passage of Proposal
2, a 2006 ballot initiative that
banned the use of affirmative
action in public institutions of
higher education, among other
areas.
In fall 2006, shortly before
Proposal 2 was passed, Black
students constituted about seven
percent of the undergraduate
population. By the fall of 2013,
Black undergraduate enroll-
ment had fallen to 4.65 percent.
Hispanic and Native American
students also experienced a
decline in terms of percentage of
the overallundergraduate popu-
lation during the same period.
Students from the Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action
and some high-school age stu-
dents from Northwestern High
School in Detroit spoke and pro-
tested during the public com-
ments section of the meeting.
"We want to call on students
on campus to jointhe movement
and to recognize that we have
that power because we have no
confidence in the administra-
tion," said Kate Stenvig, Univer-
sity alum and national BAMN

Former students
offer advice on how
to best utilize a
liberal arts degree
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Seeking to "connect, learn,
emphasize and unlock," the LSA
Student Government held its
inaugural Alumni Connections
event Thursday night, bringing
in a panel of five LSA alumni to
highlight the values of a liberal
arts degree.
The panel was sponsored by
the LSA Dean's Young Alumni
Council and the LSA Sophomore
Initiative, and hosted by LSA-
SG.
With underclassmen in mind,
the event looked to show stu-
dents the value of an LSA degree
and provide them with the
chance to see firsthand the kind
of success it can offer.
Business senior Sagar Lathia,
LSA-SG president, said the event
was everything he hoped it
would be. He said the goal was
to reassure LSA students that
choosing a major is about follow-
ing passion, not worrying about
the future.
"Ever since I was campaign-
ing last year one of the biggest
complaints I found was that
LSA students love what they are
learning, but theyare very afraid

of the applicability of their
majors in the future," he said. "I
got to thinking, what could we
do to rebrand the LSA degree, or
at least change the perspective
that students have. It shouldn't
be about fear."
Roughly 40 students attended
Thursday's forum at the Union,
which hosted five LSA alumni,
four of whom are currently Uni-
versity graduate students. They
talked with current students,
taking questions, addressing
concerns and offering advice.
LSA sophomore Emma Sar-
aff, a member of the Sophomore
Initiative's advisory board,
identified a kind of sophomore
limbo, in which students strug-
gle between the "eagerness" of
freshman year and the more
"intense focus" of juniors and
seniors who generally have con-
crete, long-term academic goals.
With this in mind, she said hav-
ing alumni speak to the nor-
malcy of this sensation was both
necessary and relevant.
First-year medical student
Julia Stella, a panelist who grad-
uated from the University with a
degree in Neuroscience, spoke to
this point, noting the struggle to
choose a major is not a bad thing.
"Don't worry about it," Stella
said. "It's not the biggest deal in
the world if you decide on a cer-
tain major and then you're like,
'Oh my gosh, I want to do some-
thing completely different."'
Law student John Lin, a Cen-
tral Student Government repre-

sentative, said choosing a major
is far easier when students let
their passions guide them rather
than picking classes because
they potentially look good on a
rasum6. He added that a liberal
arts major is valuable in many
professions.
"Being a liberal arts major has
such a versatile background and
pedagogy, and when you leave
this University, it makes you a
more well-rounded person," he
said. "We're multi-dimensional
majors and people."
First-year Business graduate
student Neil Tambe, who gradu-
ated from the University in 2009
with degrees in political sci-
ence and organizational studies,
highlighted Lin's words with an
anecdote.
"One of my best buds talks
about getting reps in things,"
Tambe said. "It's like weightlift-
ing. If you can get reps in some-
thing that is a little bit off the
beaten path, you can get some-
thing out of it that is more than
just listening to a lecture and
writing a paper on it or taking an
exam on it."
For this reason, first-year
Social Work graduate student
Kate Balzer said changing a
major should not be looked
down upon.
"Nothing is permanent," she
said. "Most of us here had some
point where we either did switch
or thought about switching.
There are a lot of opportunities

Common disorder
challenges students
during academic year
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily Staff Reporter
Bad weather has a knack for
getting people down. But when
sad leads to SAD, there's more
that students can do beside count-
ing the days until summer.

Seasonal affective disorder,
- known as SAD - is a form of
depression that is most prevalent
in regions of the country such as
the Midwest, where it is particu-
larly cold and dark between mid-
October and mid-March.
Though many students tend
to experience what is known as
"winter blues," Victoria Hays,
associate director at the Univer-
sity's Counseling and Psychology
Services, said being formally diag-
nosed with SAD does not happen

as frequently.
Often, people who have already
experienced some depression
come to realize that it worsens in
the winter after consulting with a
healthcare professional.
"It's not as common to get
someone coming in who's never
had difficulties with depression
before and whose first diagnosis
is SAD," Hays said.

Venezuelan government
dispatches additional troops

Border areas have
been particularly
active in protest
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- The Venezuelan military
planned to send additional
troops to a border region where
unrest has been particularly
fierce, officials said Thursday, as
the government faced growing
criticism for its heavy-handed
attempt to subdue a protest
movement with nighttime
sweeps that have turned
many parts of the country into
dangerous free-fire zones.
Interior Minister Miguel
Rodriguez Torres said a
battalion of paratroopers would
be dispatched to the state of
Tachira, on the western border
with Colombia, where protesters
have clashed with police and
National Guard units, bringing
the capital city, San Cristobal, to

a halt.
"These units will, enable the
city to function, so food can get
in, so people can go about their
normal lives," Rodriguez said.
"It's simply meant to restore
order."
Members of the opposition
have charged that the
government of President Nicolas
Maduro is leaning too heavily
on the military as well as police
and civilian militias to squash
opposition to his socialist
government.
San Cristobal Vice Mayor
Sergio Vergara, a member of the
opposition, said the government
had already cut off vital services,
including public transportation
and the Internet, to crack down
on what had been peaceful
protests against a government
of a country that is rich in oil but
struggling with inflation above
56 percent and one of the highest
homicide rates in the world.
The presence of some 3,000

H ,-,

troops in a city of 600,000,
Vergara said, is "effectively part
of an effort at repression being
played out by the government
across the country."
Violence has been escalating
across Venezuela since a Feb. 12
opposition rally that turned vio-
lent and left three people dead.
Since then, there have been at
least three more deaths as well
as dozens of injuries and arrests.
Police, National Guard troops
and members of private militias
have swarmed through streets
in the capital and elsewhere
firing volleys, at times indis-
criminately, in repeated spasms
of nighttime violence in recent
days.
Henrique Capriles, the two-
time presidential candidate of
an opposition coalition, said
the government has engaged
in "brutal repression" as it goes
after students and other protest-
ers, in some cases breaking into
apartment buildings to arrest
those it accuses of taking part
in an attempted coup.
"What does the
government want, a civil
war?" Capriles asked at a
news conference.
David Smolansky, an
opposition mayor of a district
in Caracas, saidthe countryis
passing through the harshest
wave of political persecution
in decades with the response
to the protests and the
jailing of opposition leader
Leopoldo Lopez. "If this isn't
a totalitarian system then I
don't know what can explain
what is happening in this
country," Smolansky said.
While several large
demonstrations by thousands
of people have been peaceful,
smaller groups of protesters
have lobbed gas bombs and
rocks and blocked streets
with flaming barricades of
trash. Troops and police
have responded with tear
gas, rubber bullets and blasts
from water cannons - as
well as raids by gun-firing
men on motorcycle.

SAPAC director addresses regents From Pge

Privacy of sexual
misconduct victims
the focus of recent
discussions, op-ed
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Online Editor
Holly Rider-Milkovich,
director of the University's
Sexual Assault Awareness and
Prevention Center, spoke to the
University's Board of Regents
Thursday about SAPAC's role in
the community.
In her speech, Rider-Milkov-
ich lauded the University's deci-
sion to keep details of sexual
misconduct inquiries private,
possibly referring to former
kicker Brendan Gibbons' case,
which resulted in his permanent

hol awareness, so we feel they
can manage those Tier II parties
much more easily," Wydra said.
"I have absolutely no plans to
expand it to Tier II or Tier IIICs."
Proppe said the amendment
will help improve safety at the
larger parties.
"The nice thing about a Tier II
party is you know who is going
to be there and so it's a little bit
more of a controlled environ-

separation from the University.
"I am also proud that this
University has withstood tre-
mendous pressure and not
revealed private student con-
cerns and private student infor-
mation," Rider-Milkovich said.
"From my national leadership
role I believe that it was the
right choice to make."
In January, the Daily report-
ed that Gibbons had been per-
manently separated from the
University in December 2013
for violating the Student Sexu-
al Misconduct Policy in 2009.
Despite national media atten-
tion, the University has refused
to release information about the
case, citing federal privacy laws
and University policies. Experts
told the Daily some information,
including the outcome of sexual
assault proceedings, can legally
be released. Gibbons was never
charged with a crime.

In an op-ed written by Rider-
Milkovich that was published
in The Detroit News Wednes-
day, she wrote that while trans-
parency in how the University
deals with sexual misconduct is
important, respect for student
privacy takes precedence.
"The unintended chilling
consequence of publicly sharing
student information may mean
fewer reports and less safety
for everyone," Rider-Milkovich
wrote.
She also wrote that a report
on the University's handling of
instances of sexual misconduct
will be released in the fall.
At the meeting, Rider-
Milkovich discussed how
changes in the sexual miscon-
duct policy led to a marked
increase in reporting. Following
changes in federal guidance, the
University changed its policy
to an investigative model under

which the University investi-
gates all allegations of student
sexual misconduct. An interim
policy began in 2011 and the final
policy took effect in August.
There were fewer than five
allegations of sexual assault or
sexual harassment reported
yearly to the University in 2009
and 2010. In contrast, there
were 68 sexual misconduct alle-
gations reported in 2011 and
75 in 2012, according to Rider-
Milkovich.
"I am glad that these numbers
have risen dramatically," she
said. "These speak to an increase
in the effectiveness of our sex-
ual misconduct policy and an
increase in the belief among our
student body that the University
of Michigan has the policies in
place to be able to address these
issues effectively."


ment," Proppe said. "At a Tier III
party that's open to students who
are not necessarily a part of the
Greek organization, it's harder to
control and hold people account-
able."
Kinesiology junior Elive
Likine, a member of the Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternity, better known as
Pike, said the policy might do the
opposite of its intention.
"I think it's going to turn into
people pre-gaming harder and
drinking faster in preparation
because they'll know they won't
be able to have it at the party,"

that SAD is most common in
women and in people between 15
and 55 years old.
According to a research report
by John Greden, professor of
psychiatry and clinical neurosci-
ences, 4 to 6 percent of people
have "full-blown" SAD and 10 to
20 percent of Americans exhibit
some symptoms. Greden serves as
the executive director of the Uni-
versity's Comprehensive Depres-
sion Center.
People suffering from SAD
often report feelingsluggish, slow
or unmotivated. Other symptoms
include drowsiness, weight gain
and craving carbohydrates as a
way to increase energy.
Hays said SAD is primarily
trigged by diminished exposure
to sunlight, not cold tempera-
tures.
"Some people are particu-
larly sensitive to changes in the
amount of sunlight, so when
there's less sunlight people feel a
lot worse," she said.
She added that the times of
year when SAD tends to take hold
and then taper off-- mid-October
and mid-March, respectively -
are also high-stress times for stu-
dents, which can make it hard to
pinpoint exactly what contributes
to the seasonal change in mood.
Light therapy is the most
effective way to combat depres-
sion caused by a lack of natural
sunlight. At the University, light
boxes are available for use in the
CAPS Wellness Zone and can also
be purchased for personal use..
People who are susceptible to
bipolar disorder should refrain

LSA junior Kendall Johnson,
LSA-SG vice president, added

much light late in the day, as this
can lead to hypomania or inter-
ruptive sleep. Generally, using
a light box for 20 minutes in the
morning three or four times a
week is recommended.
Another common treatment is
using a dawn simulator, an alarm
clock that mimics the rising sun.
Greden also cited antidepres-
sant medication and exercise as
a treatment for SAD. Because
limited amounts of sunlight can
slow down biological clocks and
delay sleep and hormone cycles,
a combination of light therapy
and prescribed medications can
be particularly effective in some
cases.
Hays said students who think
they might be affected by SAD
can go online to see if their symp-
toms meet the criteriaand explore
treatment options.
"Some of the initial treatment
recommendations can be done
without seeing a mental health
professional, but you won't know
whether or not you actually have
SAD without somebody giving
the proper diagnosis."
Because CAPS is a free service
for students, it generally does not
diagnose specific mental condi-
tions and therefore does not track
numbers of students who report
being affected by specific condi-
tions. However, the number one
reason students seek assistance
at Counseling and Psychological
Services is for issues with anxiety.
Depression is second.
The University's Comprehensive
Depression Center is located in the
Rachel Upjohn Building at 4250
Plymouth Road. The center can be
reached at 1-800-475-6424 or 734-
936-4400.
that having the alumni panelists
from a variety of backgrounds
and interests added to the event's
success.
"I think we had a pretty diverse
panel of people, especially people
who took untraditional pathways
and ended up somewhere differ-
ent than they thought they would
before," Johnson said.

Likine said. "Some people just
don't like beer. When you prevent
something like this, I feel like it
will end up blowing up in their
own face."
As for enforcement, Wydra
said the Social Responsibility
Committee - a group of Greek
members who enforce current
SEMP policy - would be able to
take on the amendment.
"When SRC comes they hit
the bathroom, they hit the
bar, wherever people are SRC
goes and checks," Wydra said.
"They're going to be interacting

with guests at these parties and
randomly checking three to five
guest IDs. As long as there is no
hard alcohol, it will be ok."
Wydra added that he believes
the amendment will be accept-
ed without much controversy
among members of Greek Life.
"Once every Greek member
completely understands the pol-
icy they will be on board with it,"
Wydra said. "It's a lot different
if the Greeks think we're taking
away something just to take away
something rather than doing it
with good intentions."

organizer.
About 20 BAMN supporters,
with signs in hand, filled the
room with chants of "Open it up
or we'll shut it down."
The BSU members present nei-
ther participated in the chants
nor spoke during the public com-
ments section. LSA senior Tyler
Collier, BSU president, said the
BSU has a different agenda than
the BAMN movement.
"We have a good relationship,
but we do want to differentiate
the agendas," Collier said. "We
want to achieve the 10 percent
demand; we don't think affirma-
tive action is necessary."
Coleman also recognized
that minority students face dif-
ficulties on campus, alluding to
several incidents of racial bias,
though not pointing to any spe-
cific events. In the fall, the Uni-
versity's chapter of the Theta Xi
fraternity was sanctioned by the
University for planning a party
that many viewed as racialized.
The event's description made use
of gang references, and students
who were invited said it paro-
died Black culture and referred to
women in offensive ways.

Beginning in November, mem-
bers of the BSU reinvigorated
discussion of campus climate
through the #BBUM campaign,
a Twitter movement that allowed
Black students to share their
experiences on campus.
On Martin Luther King, Jr.
Day, BSU members protested out-
side Hill Auditorium, announcing
their #7demands initiative, which
called on University administra-
tors to respond promptly to sev-
eral key issues facing progress
toward diversity on campus.
In a meeting with BSU leaders
on Jan. 24, the University pro-
posed to grant the Trotter Mul-
ticultural Center $300,000 for
renovations while continuing to
look for a space closer to Central
Campus for a future building.
After the regents meeting, Col-
lier said BSU representatives will
again meet with administrators
Friday. He added that he has been
pleased with the dialogue with
University officials thus far.
Before the public comments
section, Regent Shauna Ryder
Diggs (D) lauded the BSU stu-
dents for their work on bring
important issues to light.
"I wanted to thank the leader-
ship of the Black Student Union
for their leadership role in try-
ing to improve the experience

of all the students on campus,"
she said. "That is really the way I
view this."
Later in the meeting, the
regents voted to approve the
appointment of a new adminis-
trative position, associate vice
president for enrollment manage-
ment.
The position was first alluded
to by University Provost Martha
Pollack in a Jan. 16 e-mail sent to
the University community.
In an interview with the Daily
on Monday, E.Royster Harper,
vice president for student life,
said one of the biggest issues is
not difficulty finding qualified
students, but persuading those
students to choose the University.
"They've been admitted to
other schools that they perceive
as more prestigious - Yale, Har-
vard, Princeton - or the financial
aid package, or the merit pack-
age that we provide is less com-
petitive than some of the other
schools," Harper said.
The next day, in another inter-
view with Daily, Coleman said
the new position would strength-
en the connection between the
Office of Financial Aid and the
Office of Admissions.
"What we would like to do is
find a closer alliance between
admissions and financial aid,"

Coleman said. "One of the things
that we think is very very impor-
tant is that those positions work
closely together because one
of the things that may have an
impact on students accepting us
is how quickly they find outabout
financial aid or how we package
the financial aid. So this enroll-
ment manager will have the abil-
ity to look at both of those two
essential parts of this student
attraction process as well as focus
on the recruitment of underrep-
resented minority students."
Coleman said the position
will be filled after a nationwide
search, and added that the com-
mittee is "on track" to fill the spot
by this fall.
In her address, Coleman said
the University's commitment to
diversity will not waver as the
campus strives to confront chal-
lenges of inclusion and access.
"We have work to do, all of us,
together. We need to recognize
the societal factors that affect
our public institution; we need
to work within the law and with
respect to a wide variety of opin-
ion and belief," Coleman said.
"But Michigan has long been a
place where these hard conver-
sations have led to new ideas and
new energy."

From Page 1
which Ecology Prof. Deborah
Goldberg, chair of the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology, said would facilitate
the shipping and receiving of lab
supplies.
After construction is complet-
ed, the Department of Molecu-
lar, Cellular and Developmental
Biology and the Department of
Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy will be transferred into the
new space. Both units are cur-
rently located in the Edward
Henry Kraus Natural Science
Building, which was built in 1915.
Goldberg said the Kraus
building is no longer capable
of supporting contemporary
research and the large number
of researchers within the depart-
ments.
"It is pretty hard to do modern
science in a building that is close
to a hundred years old," Gold-
berg said.
LSA junior Madeline Bersch-
back said the new building will
provide a common space for biol-
ogy majors to collaborate.
"The most exciting part is that
all the biology classes will be in
the same place and we won't have
to be running from building to
building," she said. "I think the
best part of this is it will create a
really nice sense of community."

Architecture firm Smith-
GroupJJR - a firm used fre-
quently by the University - has
been chosen to design the proj-
ect.
The University's Reserve Offi-
cers' Training Corps program,
which had occupied North Hall
for more than half a century, has
been relocated to the Chemistry
Building. Once construction is
complete, the ROTC will move
to the current Kinesiology Build-
ing, and the School of Kinesiolo-
gy will be relocated to the Kraus
Building.
Plans for the demolition of
North Hall and the Museums
Annex will be formally proposed
later this year as part of the five-
year plan to complete the project.
Both biology departments are
expected to be fully relocated to
the new facility by 2019.
Ross additions, renovations
approved
Following the receipt of a
$200 million donation from real
estate mogul and University
alum Stephen Ross in September,
the regents moved ahead with
putting the money to use.
Entirely funded by gift funds,
including $100 million from the
Ross donation, the project will
renovate the older portions of the
Business School. Plans include
exterior finishes to Sam Wyly
Hall and the Hill Street Park-
ing Structure, renovations of the
Business Administration Execu-
tive Dormitory and an addition

to the Kresge Business Adminis-
tration Library.
The plans also call for
the construction of a new,
104,000-square-foot academic
building. To open up space for
the new building, the Computer
and Executive Education Build-
ing will be demolished.
Conceived to create a cohesive
look for the business complex,
the $135 million project will also
create additional research offic-
es, classrooms and study spaces,
plus larger space for admissions,
financial aid and recruiting func-
tions.
President's House renova-
tions approved
The only remaining building
from the campus' original 40
acres, the historic President's
House will soon receive $1.3 mil-
lion in infrastructure improve-
ments and interior cosmetic
upgrades.
The renovation project will
replace the flat roof surfaces,
two heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning units, repaint exte-
rior areas, repair wood, masonry
and stucco, and renovate three
bathrooms and a second floor
kitchenette. The fire detection
and alarm system will also be
replaced.
The building's last major reno-
vation occurred in 2002, before
University President Mary Sue
Coleman moved in. During
Thursday's meeting, Tim Slot-
tow, executive vice president and

chief financial officer, said this
type of project is best complet-
ed when no one is living in the
house, making the presidential
transition the ideal time to com-
mence the renovation.
The project will be funded by
investment proceeds and con-
struction is expected to conclude
before University President-elect
Mark Schlissel moves to Ann
Arbor this summer.
Next major phase in Resi-
dence Life Initiative moves
forward
As renovations at South Quad
Residence Hall wrap up this
summer, the University will
set its sights on West Quad and
Cambridge House during a two-
year renovation.
While schematic designs
were approved last year, the
regents voted Thursday to seek
bids for construction on the
370,000-gross-square-foot resi-
dence hall that is home to 1,100
students.
At a cost of $114.5 million, the
University will convert West
Quad's dining hall into a commu-
nity and practice space, with din-
ing services relocated across the
street to the new Central Campus
Dining Center in South Quad. The
renovation will also update bath-
rooms, windows, heating, cooling
and plumbing.
Schematic designs were
approved last year and construc-
tion will be completed by summer
2016.

Standardizing medical dosage
The initiative to normalize medicine must be backed by Snyder
More than 1.5 million Americans are harmed each year as the
direct result of medication errors. Of those, about 7,000 will die
from potentially preventable adverse drug effects. The sobering
facts are what stand behind the Food and Drug Administration's recent
funding of a program titled "Novel Interventions and Collaborations to
Improving the Safe Use of Medications." As one of the first 10 institutions
to take part in this program, the University has begun an initiative to
standardize the liquid concentrations of pediatric medications to reduce
the frequency of these types of medical errors. This is precisely the kind
of frontier innovation the University should continue to strive for. By
standardizing liquid concentrations across the state, the incidence of these
medical errors will decrease and lives will be saved. The University should
be commended for its participation in this potentially life-saving program.

tually, I pressed my parents into
answering my desperate nine-year-
old self as I harassed them with
questions of, "But what is sex?!"). I
remember pads and tampons were
mentioned at some point, too. That
pretty much concluded my elemen-
tary school sex ed.
Middle school was a miserable
blur, but I remember learning more
about pads and tampons. I remem-
ber watching an outdated, over-
the-top video on sexual harassment
that everyone made fun of.
In high school, I remember
studying for a sex ed quiz,
scrutinizing diagrams of a penis
and a vagina in the hour before
health class, tucking them halfway
underneath a page in my notebook
and hoping that no one would
notice me staring down a dick in
pre-calc. I remember watching a
video about a high school student
in Grosse Pointe who couldn't go
to prom because he had sex with an
underage girl. I remember feeling
bad for him.
That was essentially the extent
of my sex ed - endless instructions
on how to discretely deal with my
bleeding vagina, some unhelpful
diagrams and a misleading, blip-
of-a-lesson on sexual consent.
We never learned about sexual
orientation. We never learned
about gender and identity. We
learned that "no means no," but we
didn't learn what to do if someone
says "no" after saying "yes," or if
someone is too drunk to say "no," or
if silence is necessarily a "yes."
I can only speak for my own
experience, but I'm guessing that
sex ed is just as useless nationwide,

20 states require sex and HIV

There is arisk of dosingerrors whenapatient
is given medication. Previous initiatives that
have reduced the risk of medical errors include
computerized ordering of pharmaceuticals
and efforts to standardize medical shorthand
and abbreviations. The University study will
attempt to find a way to prevent errors when
pharmacists compound medications.
The FDA's initiative was recently launched
and the standards were published on
mipedscompounds.org as part of a statewide
campaign to educate patients, physicians,
prescribers and pharmacists, supported by a
$150,000 grant. The firstcpartof this program
will focus on pediatric patient populations
since they are especially sensitive due to their
small bodies, still-developing physiologies
and the proportionately large number of
liquid medications they are prescribed that
must be compounded. To alleviate this
problem, more than 110 different oral liquid
medications for pediatric patients across a
variety of therapeutic categories will now be
given the same standardized concentration.
Given that some pharmacies in Michigan use
concentration levels that are up to 30 times
higher than those of other pharmacies, this
push for standardization is much needed.

Endorsed by the Michigan's Academy of
Physician Assistants, Michigan Health and
Hospital Association, Michigan Pharmacist
Association, Michigan Osteopathic
Association and Michigan State Medical
Society, this initiative has received broad
medical support from across the state that
will no doubt foster meaningful collaboration
when the program is implemented statewide.
Notably missing from these official
endorsements are any political or legislative
bodies working on behalf of the state.
Gov. Rick Snyder, who has tended to focus
on access and prevention when formulating
medical legislation - with the elimination
of taxes on certain medications and the
creation of Healthy Michigan Plan - has yet
to endorse this initiative since it was first
conceived in 2011. While the federal program
only in its infancy, the state should make an
effort to support this program where it can,
when it can.
With the proximate goal of saving the lives
ofchildrenandtheultimategoalofeliminating
preventable medical errors, this initiative -
supported by the University, state doctors and
the federal government - is worth our full
support and that of the state legislature.

Labor pains

It's likely that the majority of us will go
through life without ever seeing a person die.
Most of us will not watch that last breath,
see that last look, feel a hand transition from
warm to cold or hear a heart rate monitor
go from a steady beep to the lifeless flat
line. What most of us will hear, however,
is someone colloquially using the phrase
"I'm going kill myself" or "Kill me now." I
live in a house of 12 twenty-something girls
with synced cycles, exam schedules and
social lives. The things that we would "kill
ourselves" over range from not getting a
piece of bacon on a hungover morning to two
exams in a 24-hour period to being locked
out of our house for, god forbid, 20 minutes.
Believe me, I am guilty of usingthis phrase in
every single inappropriate manner you could
imagine. And I don't know why nobody has
told me to shut the hell up yet. It is ignorant,
and it is offensive.
According to the American Foundation
for Suicide Prevention, 38,364 lives were lost
to suicide in the United States in 2010. This
means that a suicide occurred every 13.7
minutes, making suicide the 10th-leading
cause of death in America.
If you take any other top-10 killer of
Americans and treat it the same way people
treat this phrase, you would probably receive
a well-deserved punch to the face.
Two exams tomorrow? "Ugh, give
me cancer."
No bacon to cure your hangover? "AIDS

me, please."
Death is not a joke. Depression is not
informal. Every time you say "I'm gonna
kill myself" in a casual manner, you may be
twisting the knife in someone's depression.
What this doesn't mean is that things cannot
be terrible, and you can't complain, but it
means that lightheartedly threatening to
kill yourself is absolutely, always, without a
doubt, inappropriate. By doing so, you make
light of someone's disease; and you contribute
to the stigma.
Mental health is severely stigmatized in
our society. If double texting someone makes
you "crazy" in our culture, then imagine the
labels someone would get for revealing they
are stuck in a dark place. Eighty percent of the
people who seek treatment for depression are
treated successfully. Society needs to make
them proud to be brave enough and strong
enough to seek treatment, and to eradicate
the shame that comes with this disease.
There is no shame in cancer, heart disease or
stroke, and depression and suicidal thoughts
should be treated equally.
So the next time you put your first two
fingers together and pull that pretend trigger
next to your head, think about who may
be standing next to you. May it be a suicide
survivor, depression warrior or grieving
family member, there is no doubt that you are
throwing logs into the stigma fire.

as Americans suffer immensely

The Family and Medical Leave
Act of 1993 - which dictates mater-
nity leave policy in the United
States and was put in place by for-
mer President Bill Clinton - was
meant to help guarantee rights
for new and expectant mothers.
The FMLA is arguably one of the
most progressive pieces of legisla-
tion passed in the United States in
regard to health care prior to the
Affordable Care Act passed under
President Barack Obama. That
said, the FMLA only covers women
employed at large enough business-
es (50 or more people employed
within a 75-mile radius) for a long
enough period of time (12 consecu-
tive months) - leaving a whopping
40 percent of women uncovered for
any sort of maternity leave. That
means if you get a new job at a large
corporation and become pregnant
very quickly thereafter, the cor-
poration is under no obligation to
allow you to take time off and come
back to work. Or, for example, if you
are a seasonal worker, your "time

Student-run
production to
captivate hearts
By REBECCA GODWIN
DailyArts Writer
One of the last lyrics in Base-
ment Arts's upcoming show "Sea
Legs: A Nautical New Musi-
cal" is "Sweet
Ann Harbor is Se Legs:
always here for A Nautical
you / No matter
where you go / NewMusical
No matter what
you do." While Fridayat7p.m.
the lyric refers and Saturday
to the tiny fic- a 3p.m.
tional town that and 7p.m.
plays a central Walgreen
role in the pro- DramaCenter
duction, it's no
accident that Free
the town's name
sounds like Ann Arbor. The name
of the town - and the sentiment
expressed in the lyrics - were
purposeful decisions made by
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
senior Tyler Dean, who wrote the
book and lyrics for the show, and
Wayne State University senior
Michael Tooman, who composed
the music.
"My sophomore year, we did
a musical called 'Zombie Farm:
A New Musical' and it tells the
story of someone trying to figure
out where their home is, which
was fitting for an underclassman,"
Dean said. "And this one is more
about figuring out where your life
is going, so one is kind of an entry
musical and one is an exit musi-

cal."
While the show may touch
seniors as they prepare to depart
from the University, many will
find the show to be a comical
and wildly entertaining tale. The
story revolves around four friends
who live in the small New Eng-
land town of Sweet Ann Harbor
and spend their lives dreaming
of adventure out at sea. They are
faced with more adventure than
they can possibly imagine, how-
ever, when the refugees of the
underwater utopia, Periscopia,
converge on their town deter-
mined to find the man responsible
for destroying their underwater
haven.
Creating a production is quite
difficult, but the cast and crew of
"Sea Legs" was challenged to cre-
ate a brand new, full-length musi-
cal with a cast of 17 (far larger
than most Basement Arts shows)
with onlythree weeks to rehearse.
Director and recent SMTD gradu-
ate Taylor Norton was more than
up to the challenge, though, hav-
ing directed Dean's first musical.
"Since I directed 'Zombie
Farm' for Tyler and Mike in our
sophomore year, I had a pretty
good idea of the style of their work
going into it," Norton said. "And
because we only have a three week
rehearsal process to put this show
together there isn't alot of time for
character development and choic-
es and things like that, and soa lot
of the choices that affect the show
are made in casting."
Because the show required
more performers than past pro-
ductions, Norton, Dean and the
rest of the crew had a large group
of actors to choose from.

"I loved callbacks because it
was just like this 'Hunger Games'
arena," Dean said. "Everybody
brought such uniquely different
things and it was just so exciting
because there were just so many
possibilities."
While the actors brought a
spin to the characters Dean cre-
ated, the characters on their own
are already idiosyncratic. Dean
enjoyed playing with the names
of each character and matching
those names to their personali-
ties. What he came up with ranges
from the aptly named Red Her-
rington to the tongue-twisting
Cecil Seashells.
Dean also provided the actors
with in-depth character sketch-
es to help them to discover and
develop their roles. SMTD senior
Zoe Kanters, who plays Lieuten-
ant Litzche, found the character
descriptions to be particularly
helpful in figuring out her char-
acter.
"The text is pretty explanatory
of who each person is between
their songs and the way they
interact with everyone," Kant-
ers said. "And Tyler creates these
wonderful character sketches, so
without even reading the script
you can picture the characters."
Norton hopes that the show
will transcend simple entertain-
ment and touch a few hearts along
the way.
"This show is all about starting
your own adventure and I think
for some graduating seniors, that's
going to really rip some people
apart in a good way," Norton said.
"I mean I am such a sap so I'm
going to be weeping at the last
number."

"My goal is to have the largest residential pool in the world"
Drake's worst beha..vior

By ALLEN DONNE
Daily Arts Writer
On his last album Nothing Was
the Same, Aubrey Drake Graham,
said he was on his worst behav-
ior, and he has finally held true to
that statement.
This past week, the notori-
ously emotional and soft rapper
went on the interview circuit to
express himself it may have been
the questions he was asked, but
Drake spared no one mercy in his
recent interviews. Starting with
his thoughts on Macklemore's
text to Kendrick Lamar following
the Grammys, Drake told Rolling
Stone that "that shit was wack as
fuck." He continued by express-
ing how "cheap" and "not genu-
ine" the text message was.
While it may be true that
Macklemore felt Kendrick's good
kid, m.A.A.d city was the best
album of the year, Drake feltevery
nominee deserved a text from the
Seattle rapper. The indication
here is that Drake felt his album

was just as good as Kendrick's.
After all, many fans believed
there was a beef between Drake
and Kendrick. Some even thought
that Drake directed the introduc-
tory lyrics from "The Language"
toward Lamar ("I don't know
why they been lyin'/ but your shit
is not that inspirin' ").
In fact, Drake's confidence
seems so built up that he even
criticized Kanye West's new
polarizing album Yeezus. The
Toronto rapper specifically men-
tions Kanye's "Swaghili" line
being questionable. As to not
seem too bold, Drake did qualify
that Kanye is one of the greats.
If not for Kanye, Drake may not
be making the music he makes
today.
In another instance, Drake
spoke his mind about Jay Z's new
content. When visiting the James
Turrell Retrospective at LACMA,
Drake gave his thoughts about
artwork. He claims that Turrell,
known for his work with light and
space, was a huge visual influ-

ence. Drake's appreciation for art,
however, would never be a part of
his music. He elaborated, saying
that "Hov (JAY Z) can't drop bars
without at least four art referenc-
es" and the "whole rap/art world
thing is corny." While this com-
ment wasn't a shot at JAY Z, this
comment seemed oddly specific
and alarmingly bold. It appears
that Aubrey has finally forgotten
about his exes and has come to
terms with himself.
When the Rolling Stone mag-
azine finally came out, Drake
expressed his frustration with
journalism. The cover was sup-
posed to feature Drake. Instead,
Rolling Stone ran a memorial
issue for Phillip Seymour Hoff-
man. Though Drake paid his
respects to the recently deceased
actor, he also tweeted about the
evils of the press. He concluded
by saying he's "done doing inter-
views for magazines" - now,
his only goal is to produce great
music. Hopefully, this promise
pans out.

Oscar song breakdown

By GREGORY HICKS
DailyArts Writer
Think that the Academy only
considers the edgiest, most pro-
found material for awards night?
You might be "happy" to hear
otherwise. The 2013 Oscars cast
a mighty gloom on awards night
with Adele and Paul Epworth's
award-winning "Skyfall," but
no such song compares to 2014's
cheery round of nominees for Best
Original Song. Here's the musical
breakdown, inallofitspeace, plea-
sure andpassionate liberation.
"Happy" by Pharrell Wil-
liams, from "Despicable Me 2"
Even after the success of his 2013
productions, Pharrell Williams
refuses to hitthe brakes and crash-
es into this latest international
chart-topper. The pop-soul groove
- a vibe typically channeled by
Janelle Monie and occasionally
Bruno Mars nowadays - was writ-
ten and produced exclusively by
Williams; quite the testament to
the hit-maker's ability to churn
out a track worthy of many types
of award nominations. While the
song is deserving ofits nomination,
the dance-along, clap-along, feel-
good track for this animated chil-
dren's film proves to be just that: a
track targeted at children, likely a

tad too simplified and juvenile to
garner awin.
"Ordinary Love" by U2, from
"Mandela: Long Walk
toFreedom"
Who better to recruit for a "long
walktofreedom"thanthosethatso
notoriously "walk on?" While U2's
tribute to "Mandela" has the pro-
duction value of a watered-down
Mylo Xyloto track (perhaps result-
ing from Chris Martin's writing
contribution) it packs a weighted
message, nuanced by the compan-
ionship between the group and
Mandela. The tag-team formed

zel, swept in fromBroadway to belt
out this lead single for the Oscar-
nominated film, "Frozen." The per-
formance is impeccable, driven by
its lyricalcomposition (deliveredby
a Broadway superstar) and dynam-
ic emotional range, both melodi-
cally and lyrically. What might be
news to most, however, is that the
song's composers, Robert and Kris-
ten Lopez, wrote the piece specifi-
cally for Menzel. The performance
alone could single-handedly snag
the win for this track.

the play was
chosen to be a University pro-
duction.
Noel Coward, known for his
directing, acting, songwriting
and publishing of more than 50
plays, based "Hay Fever" on the
wild weekend parties thrown
by Hartley Manners - a friend
and fellow playwright - and
his melodramatic actress wife,
Laurette Taylor.
The play follows the wacky
exploits of the Bliss family, an
eccentric bohemian lot living
in an English country house.
Without consulting the other
family members, each one of
the Blisses invites a guest to
spend a weekend at the home.
However, things go awry
when each family member
pairs off with a visitor other
than the one they invited.
What ensues is a tidal wave
of romantic entanglements,
comic misunderstandings and
of course, outlandish behavior.

performance, some of Cow-
ard's songs will be added into
the show between acts. School
of Music, Theatre & Dance
senior Alex Madda, serves
as the music director for the
production and spoke about
the preparation going into the
performance.
"As music director," Madda
said, "I tested the voice ranges
of the singers and worked with
the director to select music
that best captured the essence
of the writing," she added.

Proposal claims
California must
be split into six
states to thrive

Man says state
is too big to be
efficient, pushes
ballot initiative
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
California has reached the
breaking point, says Tim
Draper. The Silicon Valley
venture capitalist is pushing a
proposal to crack the nation's
most populous state into smaller
pieces - six of them.
California has grown so big,
so inefficient, it's essentially
ungovernable, according to a
ballot initiative that could reach
voters as early as November.
It has to go, he says.
"Vast parts of our state
are poorly served by a
representative government,"
according to Draper's plan,
which cleared a key government
hurdle this week, part of the
process to qualify for the ballot.
California residents "would
be better served by six smaller
state governments."
In an interview Thursday,
Draper said he has seen a state
once regarded as a model
slide into decline - many
public schools are troubled,
transportation, water and
other infrastructure systems
are overmatched and outdated,
spending on prisons has soared.
A group of states could change
that, he said, competing and
cooperating with each other.
Without change "it will get
worse," he warned. "California
is not working."
No one would dispute that
California, home to 38 million
people, is full of rivalries and
squabbling. Dodgers or Giants.
Tacos or sushi. Where water
goes, and how much of it.
But the state has proven
reliably -resilient against
attempts to split it apart, dating
to the era of its founding in 1850.
Over the years, proposals have
suggested California should be
two states, or three, or four.
"It's certainly fun to
talk about," said Raphael

Sonenshein, executive director
of the Pat Brown Institute of
Public Affairs at California State
University, Los Angeles. But "its
prospects are nil."
Even if it were to be approved
by voters, Congress would have
to endorse the idea of creating
six new states - and adding
10 senators to the chamber's
political mix (as with all states,
California currently has two).
Congress, under the U.S.
Constitution, must approve the
creation or division of any states.
"I don't think anyone is going
to give California 12 Senate
seats," Sonenshein said.
Draper, in documents he sub-
mitted to the Secretary of State's
Office, recommends dividing
California regionally, including
establishing a state called Sili-
con Valley, which would include
San Francisco and nearby coun-
ties that are home to technology
giants like Facebook and Apple.
Los Angeles would become
part of the new state of West
California, which also would
include the coastal cities of
Santa Barbara and Ventura. The
state's farming heartland would
become Central California. San
Diego would be the largest city
in the new South California.
Earlier this week, he received
approval from the state to begin
collecting petition signatures
to qualify the proposal for the
ballot - he needs about 808,000
by mid-July to make the cut.
It's also possible the proposal
could be delayed until 2016.
Facing a tight deadline to gather
signatures and build political
momentum, "I want to make
sure there is enough time,"
Draper said.
The complexities of dividing
a state the size of California, by
itself among the world's top 10
economies, would be daunting.
What would become of the
California State Water Project,
which uses aqueducts and
_,pumping stations to disperse
water across the state? If the
federal government approves
the idea, tax collections and
spending by the state would end,
and its assets and debts would
have to be divided.

sEi CHULAVKOV/AP
Activists pay respects to protesters killed in clashes with police, in Kiev's Independence Square, the epicenter of the country's current unrest. Fierce clashes
between police and protesters, some including gunfire, shattered a brief truce in Ukraine's besieged capital Thursday, killing numerous people.
Over 100 killed in Ukraine protests,
president refuses to leave position

EU sanctions fail
to halt violence,
clash in Kiev sees
its deadliest day
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -
Protesters advanced on police
lines in the heart of the Ukrainian
capital on Thursday, prompting
government snipers to shoot back
and kill scores of people in the
country's deadliest day since the
breakup of the Soviet Union a
quarter-century ago.
The European Union imposed
sanctions on those deemed
responsible for the violence, and
three EU foreign ministers held
a long day of talks in Kiev with
both embattled President Viktor
Yanukovych and leaders of the
protests seeking his ouster. But
it's increasingly unclear whether
either side has the will or abilityto
compromise.
Yanukovych and the opposition
protesters are locked in a battle
over the identity of Ukraine, a na-
tion of 46 million that has divided

loyalties between Russia and the
West. Parts of the country - most-
ly in its western cities - are in
open revolt against Yanukovych's
central government, while many
in eastern Ukraine back the presi-
dent and favor strong ties with
Russia, their former Soviet ruler.
Protesters across the country
are also upset over corruption in
Ukraine, the lack of democratic
rights and the country's ailing
economy, which just barely
avoided bankruptcy with a $15
billion aid infusion from Russia.
Despite the violence, defiant
protesters seemed determined
to continue their push for
Yanukovych'sresignationandearly
presidential and parliamentary
elections. People streamed toward
the square Thursday afternoon
as other protesters hurled wood,
refuse and tires on barricades.
"The price of freedom is too
high. But Ukrainians are pay-
ing it," said Viktor Danilyuk, a
30-year-old protester. "We have
no choice. The government isn't
hearing us."
In an effort to defuse the situ-
ation, the national parliament late
Thursday passed a measure that

would prohibit an "anti-terrorist
operation" threatened by Yanu-
kovych to restore order, and called
for all Interior Ministry troops to
return to their bases. But it was
unclear how binding the move
would be. Presidential adviser
Marina Stavnichuk was quoted by
the Interfax news agency as saying
the measure goes into effect im-
mediately, but that a mechanism
for carrying it out would have to
be developed by the president's
office and the Interior Ministry.
At least 101 people have died
this week in the clashes in Kiev,
according to protesters and Ukrai-
nian authorities, a sharp reversal
inthree months of mostly peaceful
protests. Now neither side appears
willing to compromise.
Thursday was the deadliest day
yet at the sprawling protest camp
on Kiev's Independence Square,
also called the Maidan. Snipers
were seen shooting at protesters
there - and video footage showed
at least one sniper wearing a
Ukraine riot police uniform.
One of the wounded, volunteer
medic Olesya Zhukovskaya, sent
out a brief Twitter message - "I'm
dying" - after she was shot in the

coordinator for the protesters,
said she was in serious condition
after undergoing surgery.
Musiy told The Associated
Press that at least 70 protesters
were killed Thursday and over
500 were wounded in the clashes
- and that the death toll could rise
further.
In addition, three policemen
were killed Thursday and 28
suffered gunshot wounds, Interior
Ministry spokesman Serhiy
Burlakov told the AP.
The National Health Ministry
said a total of 75 people died in the
clashes Tuesday and Thursday,
but did not give a breakdown.
Earlier Thursday, however, it said
28 people had died.
There was no way to immedi-
ately verify any of the death tolls.
French Foreign Minister
Laurent Fabius, along with his
German and Polish counterparts,
said after a five-hour meeting
with Yanukovych and another
with opposition leaders that they
discussed new elections and a new
government, but gave no details.
The three resumed meeting with
Yanukovych late Thursday.

E-mail announces international
club teams to play iAnn Arbor

Baseball aiming
to stay consistent

By A LEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
The beautiful game is finally
coming to Ann Arbor.
Thursday afternoon, the
International Champions Cup
sent an e-mail promoting "The
Gods of Soccer" visiting Ann
Arbor, among 11 other North
American cities.
The International Champions
Cup pits some of the world's elite
clubs in an elimination tourna-
ment. This year, the competition
features Real Madrid, Manches-
ter United, Inter Milan, A.C.
Milan, Olympiacos, Manchester
City, AS Roma and Liverpool FC.
Though the e-mail did not
confirm the clubs or venue in
Ann Arbor, it coincides with a
Jan 31 report that Manchester
United and Real Madrid will
meet Aug. 2 at Michigan Stadi-
um. Currently, the international
Champions Cup website lists a
game between them at a venue
and time "to be determined."
MLive reported Jan. 31 that
the Athletic Department "has
engaged in discussions about
future events" at the Big House.
Real Madrid, which won the
inaugural tournament last year,
boasts 32 La Liga titles. Man-
chester United has finished atop
the English Premier League 13
times since its foundation in 1992.
The two clubs feature some of
soccer's elite players, including
Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth
Bale of Los Blancos, the Spanish
team's nickname, and Robin van
Persie and Wayne Rooney of The
Red Devils.
Readying the Big House
for soccer - if that is where
the match is held - won't
come without its share of
complications. Per FIFA,

The Michigan baseball pro-
gram is built on consistency, and
according to coach Erik Bakich,
"consistency leads to success."
It's why even though Bakich
knows his squad needs some
adjustments, he isn't going out
of his way to make them. Rather,
his team needs to continue doing
what it's doing.
This Friday, Michigan (1-2-1)
returns to the Lone Star State,
after playing in the Texas State
Invitational last weekend, to
compete against Houston (4-0) in
a three-game series.
Bakich acknowledges the
Cougars' pitching this weekend
will be far above what they saw
with their last three opponents,
and he says his team is motivated
and ready to face the challenge.
He called Houston a "postseason
team," a title that might not be
too far-fetched. The Cougars are
coming off their first 30-plus-
win season since 2008, and last
weekend they recorded three
shutouts against Nicholls State.
Left-handed pitcher Jared West
allowed only one hit through
seven innings Sunday, and earned
ACC Pitcher of the Week.
To prepare, the Wolverines
have continued playing indoor
scrimmages and Bakich saw
high energy, confidence and
motivation in the three-inning
games played Tuesday and
Wednesday. The dynamics of
the team's scrimmages haven't
changed, and that lends itself to
Bakich's emphasis on routine.
Part of Michigan's routine is
the team's debriefing, when after
each game the coaching staff
compares notes and discusses

what areas need to be tweaked.
One thought that stuck with
Bakich was his bullpen. He
doesn't think the pitchers' youth
cost the team its early leads this
weekend, but rather attributes it
to overextension of the pitchers
in general. Bakich wanted to
use senior left-handed pitcher
Logan McAnallen throughout the
weekend, but had to use him for
relief over four-innings Friday,
his only time on the mound.
For the Wolverines to sit
comfortably on a lead, they will
need a pitcher who can go deep
in the game and minimize the
pitch count. The answer for
Michigan is right-handed pitcher
Ben Ballantine. the senior pitched
seven innings and allowed zero
runs in the Wolverines' 8-2 win
over Air Force Saturday. One
inning, he needed just three
pitches for three outs. With
such efficiency, it wouldn't be
surprising to see Ballantine go
deep in his Sunday start.
Aside from getting starters
to make an impact deeper in the
game, Bakich wants to see quality
pitchingthat forces contact.
Bakich knows the jitters that
come with opening weekend can
lead to sloppy play, and that is
why he preaches consistency as
the key to success - he doesn't
want to jump to conclusions. And
now in week two, with more to
be thrown Michigan's way, he
expects the team's nerves to cool.
If the Wolverines hope to drive
in runs and be able to sit on a lead,
it is a matter of keepingtheir pace
consistent throughout the entire
game and drive away thoughts of
the end result.
"You can't look ahead," Bakich
said. "We're talking about playing
pitch-to-pitch."

The Big House could play host to Real Madrid and Manchester United this summer according to an e-mail on Thursday.

international soccer's governing
body, a regulation pitch must be
between 70 and 80 yards wide
for international matches, but
a college football field is just
53 yards across. Tournament
officials could either erect an
elevated platform to provide the
necessary width or, because the
game is essentially preseason
exhibition for both clubs, accept
playing with non-regulation
dimensions.
Additionally, Michigan Sta-
diun uses an artificial surface,
which has been criticized as
being sub-optimal for soccer.
When the United States Men's
National Team played Panama

at CenturyLink Field in Seattle
last June, the U.S. Soccer Feder-
ation installed a temporary layer
of grass over the artificial turf.
It is unclear whether the Inter-
national Champions Cup will do
the same.
The nation's largest American
football stadium is no stranger
to non-football events. In 2010, it
hosted Michigan and Michigan
State in the Big Chill at the Big
House, setting the record for
attendance at a hockey game.
On New Year's Day this year, the
2014 Winter Classic at Michigan
Stadium drew more than
100,000 fans.
Even if hosted at the Big

House, the Real Madrid-
Manchester United matchup
won't approach the attendance
mark for soccer, which FIFA
recognizes as 173,850 at the
1950 World Cup Final in Rio De
Janeiro. But it could top the list
of attendance at a soccer game in
the United States, which stands
at 101,799 for the final of the
1984 Summer Olympics between
France and Brazil.
Michigan Stadium officially
seats 109,901 for football games.
And after spending the sum-
mer watching the World Cup in
Brazil, fntbol fans can turn their
eyes toward Ann Arbor and two
of the world's most storied clubs.

With sophomore midfielder
Kyle Jackson's goal in overtime
against Detroit Wednesday night,
confidence levels reached an all-
time high for the Michigan men's
lacrosse team after a 14-13 win.
But just three days later, a huge
challenge looms large in Division
I powerhouse No. 7 Johns
Hopkins as the Wolverines (2-1)
will travel to Baltimore to take on
the Blue Jays at Homewood Field.
"Growing up watching
lacrosse, pretty much all the ones
you saw were on Homewood
Field," said junior attacker David
McCormack on the athletic
department's website. "To be a
part of that and play on that field
and play a storied program like
Hopkins is pretty awesome."
After scoring a program-high
20 goals against Mercer and win-
ning an overtime thriller against
in-state rival Detroit, Michigan
will have to change gears when
it takes on a much tougher oppo-
nent in Johns Hopkins (2-0) Sat-
urday afternoon.
"This is a program that, as our
program grows for us, (Johns
Hopkins) is a benchmark pro-
gram," said Michigan coach John
Paul on WTKA Radio Tuesday
morning. "We'll know where we
are when we're competing with
them year in, year out."
Though in 2013, the nine-time
NCAA champion Blue Jays fell
vastly below expectations as the
team went 9-5 and didn't make
the NCAA Tournament for the
first time in 41 years.
This season, Johns Hopkins
opened up its campaign by
beating both Towson and Ohio
State. The Blue Jays needed three
overtimes to beat the Buckeyes,
while they beat Towson, 15-8, in
regulation.
Michigan will meet Johns
Hopkins for the second time in its
history after the Wolverines lost
17-8 at Homewood Field last year.
Johns Hopkins' offense is led
by the three-headed attack of
Brandon Benn, Wells Stanwick
and Ryan Brown, who have com-
bined for 14 goals and 14 assists in
the Blue Jays' first two games.

Johns Hopkins will also count
on faceoff man Drew Kennedy to
get them possessions. Kennedy
has a faceoff winning percentage
of 74 percent and will provide
tough competition for Michigan
sophomore faceoff man Brad
Lott, who played in just his first
game against Detroit. Lott was 22
of 30 from the X.
For the Wolverines to have a
chance at winning the game, Lott
will have to outduel Kennedy in
the faceoff circle.
"Brad had an amazing game
last night, but Hopkins is a much
different challenge on faceoffs."
Paul said. "I'm looking forward to
see how Brad responds to it."
The Blue Jay defense will be
vastly different than the defense
that was third in the nation in
scoring defense last season. Gone
is William C. Schmeisser Award
winner - given to the nation's
top defensemen - Tucker Durkin
and goaltender Pierce Bassett,
who was third in the country in
save percentage last season.
This season, the Blue Jays will
rely on goaltender Eric Schneider
to defend the cage. He appeared in

a game against Michigan, in
which he had five saves.
Attackman Ian King, who
hopes to capitalize on Schneider's
inexperience, leads the team with
eight goals. Beside the freshman,
the Wolverines have received a
dearthofscoringfrommanyother
players as well. Overall, 12 Michi-
gan players have found the back of
the net in the three games played.
"This offense can score
goals, if we get the ball we will
score goals," Paul said. "I'm not
concerned about scoring goals as
I am getting possessions."
Paul also mentioned that
attackmen Peter Kraus and Will
Meter may see their first action
of the season after being held out
the firstthreegamesofthe season
due to injuries.
One of the most important
goals this season was Jackson's
goal to get the record-breaking
win over Detroit. The goal was a
huge step for the progression of
the lacrosse program at Michigan.
But against NCAA royalty in
Johns Hopkins, it will take not
only goals, but also an all-around
great, if not perfect game, to

impressive 13-5
start, Michigan dropped five of
seven, struggling with defense
and failing to connect on long-
range jumpers that had guided it
to the top of the Big Ten.
But the Wolverines have man-
aged to bounce back by stringing
two wins together for the first
time since Jan. 18 with two more
games to play before the Big Ten
Tournament.
And first up, Michigan has
its last home game of the season
Saturday, facing Iowa (8-5, 20-7)
in a matinee. It's the team's first
matchup with the Hawkeyes this
season.
Unfortunately for the Wolver-
ines, they haven't had the same
success at home as they have on
the road. Posting a measly 6-7
record compared to their more
impressive 9-1-road record.
But Michigan has one last
chance to right the ship at Crisler
Center and send its seniors out in
fashion for the team's senior day.
To do so, the Wolverines will
need to slow down a hot-handed
Iowa team. The Hawkeyes have
notched impressive wins over
then-ranked No. 14 Dayton in
November, then-No. 22 Syracuse

in December and then-No. 9 Penn
State at Happy Valley in February.
Iowa's success has stemmed
from its offense where it sits first
in the conference scoring offense
and second in field goal percent-
age, and five players averag-
ing double digits to thank for it.
Leading their streaking offense is
guard Samantha Logic and center
Bethany Doolittle, who average
14.3 points and 14.1points, respec-
tively. Logic also averages a con-
ference-best 7.5 assists per game.
The Hawkeyes sit in third place
in the conference and will fight
to get into the top two in order to
earn two byes in the conference
tournament in two weeks.
If Michigan continues to com-
mit defensive lapses, like it has
recently during its five losses, it
will struggle against Iowa. Most
notably it's the Wolverines' sec-
ond-half slips that led to their
demise. But against the Hoosiers,
it was Michigan's 44-point second
half, after being down by six at
halftime that gave it the win.
The Wolverines will have to
try and replicate that new-found
second-half success against the
red-hot Hawkeyes - who average
79.4 points per game. In doing so,
junior forward Cyesha Goree will
need to continue offensive ways
as of late, after scoring 40 points
in her last two games.
Freshman point guard Siera
Thompson has been a sensation
from beyond the arc for most of
the season and the Wolverines
will rely on her finding a groove
on the court early and often.
Note: Junior forward .Nicole
Elmblad was named to the Capi-
tal One Academic All-America
second team Thursday. As a bio-
psychology, cognition and neuro-
science major the captain sports
a 3.95 GPA. She is only the second
Wolverine in program history
to earn Academic All-American
honors.

Chance to sweep Spartans

The beginning of the season
for any talented and highly
ranked teamwill have unforeseen
challenges and missteps.
For the No. 7 Michigan softball
team, though, the first third of the
season is a frenzied blitz.
Six tournaments in six week-
ends, thousands of miles of travel
and top competition await the
Wolverines each preseason. The
team heads into the halfway point
of the grueling stretch this week-
end as it travels to Boca Raton, Fla.
tofaceKentState,Pittsburgh,Flor-
ida Atlantic and No. 5 Kentucky at
the Florida Atlantic Kickoff.
"Only the tough go to
Michigan," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "Everybody else
goes somewhere warm."
The travel burden hasn't fazed
Michigan (7-2) thus far. Instead,
the Wolverines have beaten a pair
of ranked teams and scored 65
runs in their first nine games.
"Being locked in Oosterbaan
for practice," said senior
centerfielder Lyndsay Doyle, "it's
always exciting to get on dirt and
big blue skies and just play ball."
Doyle, the leadoff hitter for
Michigan, is currently in one of
the best hitting stretches of her
career witha.444batting average,
16 hits and a nine-game hitting
streak. The first four hitters inthe
batting order have also performed
well thus far and have provided a
remarkable stability by starting
every game of the season.
Hutchins has continued to
rotate the lower half ofthe batting
order, particularly in response
to the Wolverines' tendency to
strand runners on base. Outside
of the top four hitters, the team
is just 3-for-28 on the season with
runners in scoring position.
Against Kentucky, Michigan
will face top-five competition for
the second time this season, but
will be looking for a much differ-
ent result. On opening weekend, a
late-inning collapse against cur-

rent No. 1 Florida cost the Wolver-
ines a game they controlled.
The Wildcats (10-0) are off to
the best start in program history
and feature a dangerous hitter
in Griffin Joiner. The catcher is
batting .556 on the season and
owns a 1.296 slugging percentage
to go along with six home runs.
Michigan also has power at the
plate, though, with sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero hitting
.536, two grand slams and 17
RBI despite being intentionally
walked frequently.
Romero was given co-Big Ten
Player of the Week honors after a
strongperformance last weekend,
and freshman pitcher Megan
Betsa received Freshman of the
Week recognition.
"It's hard coming in as a
freshman," Doyle said. "They've
all done really well, and that's
what we need. It doesn't matter
if you're a freshman or a senior,
if you're playing on the field, we
need you to do your part."
The pitchingstaff has also been
the subject of Hutchins' continual
toying this season. Junior Haylie
Wagner, junior Sara Driesenga
and Betsa give the Wolverines a
fearsome rotation with experience
and talent, but Hutchins has not
been satisfied yet with the results.
Instead, Hutchins said that
Driesenga needs to stay ahead in
the count and that Betsa is still
givingup too many free bases.
The rotation has been
unpredictable thus far, with a few
complete games registered and
the rest splitting time. Michigan
will need all three pitchers in
top form this weekend if it hopes
to complete its first undefeated
tournament of the season.
The offense has come in
bunches, but the Wolverines have
yet to string together the kind of
tournament they are looking for
with the depth and experience
of this team. Facing a middling
field and one strong opponent
in Kentucky, Michigan won't be
happy returning after anything
less than an undefeated weekend.

That was
the last time
the Michigan
men's basket-
ball team lost
back-to-back
games. Since
that fateful
day, when
the Spartans
clobbered
the Wolver-
ines, 75-52,
Michigan
has avoided
the same fate
nine times.

guard Keith Appling, who had
missed the previous four games
due to a lingering wrist injury.
Despite the four-game absence
to heal the injury, Appling was
a non-factor in the loss. Playing
19 minutes, the senior attempted
just two shots and recorded two
points as Michigan State shot a
putrid 34 percent from the field.
After the game, Spartan
coach Tom Izzo said he was con-
sidering "shutting him down"
for the remainder of the regular
season. However, on Thursday
against Purdue, Appling was on
the court, albeit for 25 minutes.
Though it appears Appling
will be available in some
capacity Sunday as well, what
is yet to be determined is the
status of forward Branden
Dawson. After missing his
eighth straight game against
Purdue, speculation remains
that the junior will be available
against Michigan, even in just a
limited role.

20th-ranked Wolverines plan to
push that streak to 10, it'll come
against that same Michigan
State team Sunday.
After playing six games in
the span of 17 days starting
Jan. 30, Michigan is coming off
its longest break since playing
every Saturday with no weekday
games from the seventh to
the 28th of December. And
following a tough loss this past
Sunday to Wisconsin, the respite
was welcomed.
"It's just time to rest," said
redshirt junior forward Jon
Horford on Sunday, "especially
for the high-minute guys. We
can focus on the next opponent
and collect ourselves and just
get ready for a push."
Added Michigan coach John
Beilein: "When you come out of
(playing games so frequently)
we try to get some rest. But it
is good for us to be able to rest
a little bit, be able to get back in
the gym and practice."
After it appeared that
Michigan would fall a game
behind Michigan State in the
Big Ten standings following
its game Sunday, Michigan
ultimately remained in a first-
place tie after No. 13 Michigan
State (11-3 Big Ten, 22-5 overall)
fell to Nebraska at home.
The game marked the first
