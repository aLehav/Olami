Wednesday 
afternoon, 

more than 40 people — the 
majority from the University 
of 
Michigan 
Romance 

Language 
and 
Literature 

Department — participated in 
a demonstration on the Diag as 
a part of the “Ni Una Menos” 
movement, with the aim of 
exposing 
violence 
toward 

women in Latin America and 
the United States.

The event was one of many 

of its kind that took place 
Wednesday across the United 
States 
to 
 
commemorate 

the killing of Lucia Perez, a 
young Argentenian woman. 

Perez was brutally raped and 
killed last week in La Plata, 
the 
capital 
of 
Argentina’s 

Buenos 
Aires 
province, 

immediately 
resulting 
in 

several demonstrations across 
the country.

“The 
(#NiUnaMenos) 

movement 
was 
originally 

to 
protest 
against 
gender 

violence, and especially all 
the women who are killed in 
Mexico Argentina, Guatemala 
and Colombia, but it’s turned 
into something greater,” said 
Rackham 
student 
Ludmila 

Ferrari 

The phrase “Ni Una Menos” 

was coined in 1993 in a poem 
written by Susana Chavez. In 
the poem, Chavez references 

In Ron Weiser’s third bid 

for a seat on the University of 
Michigan’s Board of Regents, 
the 
former 
ambassador 
and 

University philanthropist wants 
voters to know he means business 
— literally.

Weiser 
founded 
prominent 

real 
estate 
firm 
McKinley 

Associates Inc. nearly 50 years 
ago, and served as ambassador to 
Slovakia under former President 
George Bush from 2001 to 2005. 
He also chaired the Michigan 
Republican Party from 2009 to 
2011. Currently, he has a role in 
Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump’s campaign by 
fundraising as part of the Trump 
Victory Committee.

He previously ran for regent 

unsuccessfully in 2014. In 2012, 
Weiser began a campaign for the 
role but dropped out to focus on 
his position as finance chairman 
for 
the 
Republican 
National 

Committee.

In his 2014 campaign, Weiser 

focused on issues of student 
affordability but ultimately lost 
the race to current regent Mike 
Behm (D) by a margin of 4,835 
votes. This time around, he said 
he hopes to capture the seat by 
honing in on rising tuition rates 
and a growing budget.

“We need to keep the University 

as affordable as possible,” he said. 
“It’s not fair to burden kids.”

Weiser pointed to his diverse 

background in both bureaucracy 

and business as reasons he’s well 
suited for the job.

“There’s no businesspeople, 

especially ones that have been 
involved in bureaucracy,” he said 
of the University’s current Board 
of Regents. “I learned a lot in the 
State Department about getting 
things done.”

One current regent, Denise 

Ilitch (D–Bingham Farms), does 
have notable business experience 
— she is president of Ilitch 

Enterprises, owner of Denise 
Ilitch Designs and the owner 
and publisher of Ambassador 
Magazine. 
Ilitch 
and 
fellow 

sitting regent Laurence Deitch 
(D–Bloomfield Hills) are running 
incumbent campaigns to regain 
their seats come the general 
election Nov. 8. Carl Meyers, 
Republican and former treasurer 
of the Michigan GOP, is also 
competing for a seat on the board.

Weiser’s 
campaign 
website 

touts his ability to “run the U of M 
like a business.” In an interview, 
however, he softened that claim 
slightly.

“I would run the University 

not like a business, it’s more like 
an NGO,” he said, referring to 
non-governmental organizations. 
“Students 
are 
customers... 
I 

always take time to meet with 
students.”

To combat the increase in 

The city of Ann Arbor has 

begun planning for this year’s 
wintertime deer cull, the second 
iteration of the city’s four-
year plan to manage its deer 
population.

The 
Michigan 
Department 

of Natural Resources gave Ann 
Arbor permission to kill up to 100 
deer within city boundaries last 
December. The first part of the 
cull took place earlier this year 
between January and March, 
killing 63 deer.

Ann 
Arbor 
released 
its 

2017 deer management plan, 
which calls for the use of both 
a lethal cull and non-lethal 
sterilization methods to control 
the deer population, Friday. The 
management plan also proposes 
developing 
an 
educational 

program for residents to protect 
their property, such as by fencing 
or 
refraining 
from 
keeping 

certain plants.

The cull was highly unpopular 

among many citizens and some 
members of City Council — when 
the it was first introduced — 
citizens expressed concern over

Randy Clark, candidate for the Michigan State House of Representatives, addresses 
the audience at the College Republican’s presidential debate watch party in Angell Hall 
Wednesday.

At watch parties for the final 

presidential debate Wednesday 
night, hosted by the University 
of Michigan’s chapters of College 
Democrats 
and 
Students 
for 

Hillary as well as the College 
Republicans, students divided 
along party lines with two 
distinct interpretations of who 
won the debate and how each 
candidate performed.

During the debate, Democratic 

nominee Hillary Clinton and 
Republican 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump discussed a range of 

issues, from debt and entitlement 
reform, immigration, economy, 
the Supreme Court, foreign hot 
spots and fitness to be president.

One of the more significant 

moments of the debate came 
about halfway through, when 
Trump was asked if he would 
concede the election if he were 
to lose. Over the past month, 

the candidate has been raising 
concerns that the election will 
be rigged against him — claims 
that have been met with a critical 
response.

In 
response, 
Trump 
said, 

“I’ll tell you at the time,” an 
unprecedented 
answer 
for 
a 

candidate in recent history.

Policy 
hosted 
a 
policy 
talk 

Wednesday afternoon featuring 
Justin Lin, former World Bank 
Chief Economist, on the future of 
economic relations between the 
U.S. and China.

Moderated by Associate prof 

of Public Policy John Ciorciari, 
the director of the International 
Policy Center, the talk began with 
Lin offering a general overview 
of the recent developments in the 
Chinese economy. Though the 
Chinese government announced 
Wednesday that growth in GDP 
for the last economic quarter was 
6.7 percent, Lin acknowledged 
that recently, growth has been a 
disappointment and compared to 
past years, this rate is low.

However, Lin said China is a 

transitional economy moving into 
an era in which domestic consumer 
spending 
will 
drive 
growth. 

He added that other emerging 
economies, like those in Brazil and 
Russia, have also seen their growth 
rates decline in recent years.

EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY.

What do Drake and 

actress Emily Blunt have in 

common? They each gave 

Ann Arbor a shoutout on their 

recent Saturday Night Live 

appearances. 

Last week, Blunt starred in 

an SNL skit titled “Short Film” 

that poked fun at the the city’s 

artsy culture. 

In the skit, Blunt, who was 

on the show promoting her new 

film, “The Girl on the Train,” 

plays the protagonist in a short 

film introduced as part of a 

Ann Arbor film festival, who is 

seen running through a forest 

and then, upon falling, having a 

moment of self-realization. 

After the screening of the 

film, the skit then continues 

with all of the cast members 

participating in a Q&A session. 

Actress Vanessa Bayer plays the 

sole audience member asking 

questions. 

Ann Arbor’s artsy reputation 

and its cultural attractions 

are well known, bolstered in 

particular by the Art Fair each 

summer and the actual film 

festival, held in March.

SNL’s recent sketch is not 

Ann Arbor’s first mention by 

SNL in the past year — this past 

May, Drake guest starred in a 

sketch about workplace banter 

at an office supply store. In 

it, Drake proudly displays his 

University of Michigan coffee 

mug. 

When asked if he was a 

Michigan fan, Drake told his 

coworkers, played by Beck 

Bennett and Bobby Moynihan, 

that he was born and raised in 

Ann Arbor and was an alumnus 

of the University.

Though Ann Arbor is more 

than 600 miles away from the 

Big Apple, it appears like the 

quaint college town remains on 

the writers’ minds.

HANG TIME

For University of Michigan 

professor 
Mary 
Kelley, 
a 

pioneer in the field of women’s 
studies over the past 40 years, 
teaching this year has felt 
especially meaningful in an 
election year with the first 
major party female nominee.

Kelley said her interests in 

higher education and public 
life were first sparked by the 
fact that she did not encounter 
many females when she was in 
high school.

“It was the absence that 

provoked my curiosity,” she 
said. “I think it was looking 
for women like myself; that 
is to say, women who had 
intellectual aspirations, and 
wanted 
to 
practice 
those 

aspirations in public life.”

She later became interested 

specifically 
in 
women’s 

studies during her time as 
an undergraduate at Mount 
Holyoke 
University, 
the 

oldest women’s college in the 
country, after speaking with 
individuals in the field. Right 
after she graduated college, in 
1965, she took her own first 
steps into the topic, publishing 
her first book on 19th-century 
American female writers that 
yearned to prove themselves 
as being capable of more than 
domestic housewives. During 
her career, she’s combined 
expertise in history, American 
culture and women’s studies to 
help women’s studies flourish 
as a legitimate discipline. As a 
History prof. at Dartmouth — 
which had only become co-ed 
a few years prior to Kelley’s 
arrival 
in 
1977 
— 
Kelley 

was part of an initiative to 
establish a women’s studies 
program and the college’s 

women’s center, dedicated to 
providing a range of resources 
for women.

Since 2002, Kelley has been 

at the University of Michigan. 
She said she find the school 
substantially 
more 
diverse 

and accommodating of the 
need for women’s studies.

Women 
studies 
at 
the 

University

Today, much of what Kelley 

discusses in her current class 
draws on examples from the 
University. For example, for 
many 
years, 
women 
were 

not allowed in the Michigan 
Union on campus, forcing 
them to create their own 
spaces to congregate, like 
the Michigan League and 
women’s only dorms such 
as Helen Newberry, Betsy 
Barbour and Martha Cook.

Kelley said she likes that 

women on campus established 
their own spaces, regardless 
of existing restrictions.

“Having gone to a women’s 

college, I think all female 
spaces for certain parts of our 
lives, certain segments of our 
lives are important,” Kelley 
said.

She noted that because 

women’s studies can be an 
abstract 
field, 
it 
requires 

research into qualitative, not 
quantitative sources. For her 
2006 book, “Learning to Stand 
and Speak”, she used archives 
and tangible materials to make 
inferences about the evolution 
of American women’s reading 
and writing practices. Her 
students use similar tactics to 
conduct their own research.

Kate 
Silbert, 
a 
Ph.D. 

candidate 
in 
history 
and 

women’s 
studies 
and 
one 

of 
Kelley’s 
students, 
said 

Kelley’s redefinition of the 
field 
of 
higher 
education 

for women influenced her 
own project — exploring the 
history of female intellectual 
activity 
through 
messages 

from journals, paintings and 

Mary Kelley, a pioneer in women’s 
studies, aims to find nuance in field

the Spanish phenomenon of 
“feminicide” 
— 
a 
concept, 

according to the Ferrari, that 
all too many Latina women 
are familiar with. Ferrari said 
the term is used to describe 
the unceasing deaths and acts 
of violence toward girls and 
women in Latin America. 

“It’s 
a 
global. 
It 
began 

in Argentina, but now it is 
everywhere,” she said. “And 
today, 
these 
protests 
are 

happening across the United 
States at several universities 
including Princeton, University 
of Kansas, in Chicago, San 
Francisco. It’s a strike that 
begins with Latina women, but 
it actually involved all women.”

Ana Sabau, Rackham student 

in the Department of Romance 
Language and Literature, said 
the Latino community in Ann 
Arbor wanted to commemorate 
Perez’s death and the problem 
of violence as a whole by 
organizing in unity.

“Lots of my colleagues and 

myself were thinking, what 

could we do in the United States 
to show our solidarity with 
those movements and to also 
start having the conversation 
here,” Sabau said. “So two days 
ago, we organized different 
strikes that are going to be 
happening at different colleges 
in the United States.”

During the event, a list of 

names of female Michigan 
citizens who had been killed 
by police since 2010 were read 
aloud by the protesters.

Sabau said the University 

of California, Berkeley, the 
University of Texas at Austin, 
the University of Kansas and 
other schools in New York 
demonstrated Wednesday as 
well.

Sabau 
added 
that 
the 

demonstrations have a broader 
scope, and represent issues of 
class and race in addition to 
violence against women. 

“It’s a very difficult reality to 

live with,” she said. “Part of the 
show up today was to make us 
think about the differences and 
what happened specifically in 
Mexico, Argentina and Peru. 
But also, I would also think 
that some of these issues are 

traversed by class and race, 
so I think that it’s important 
to 
think 
about 
how 
the 

violence is expressive of those 
differences.”

During 
the 
event, 
signs 

and pamphlets with a list of 
hashtags were handed out as 
well. Below “Ni Una Menos” 
was “Viva Nos Queremos,” 
which 
was 
translated 
by 

Ferrari as “We Want Us Alive.”

Ferrari said the hashtags 

and movement focuses on the 
lives of all women and girls; not 
just those from Latin America. 
She 
emphasized 
what 
she 

described as the value of both 
the physical and emotional 
impact of eliminating gender-
related violence in the world.

“We want to have a complete 

life, 
but 
also 
an 
integral 

life,” 
Ferrari 
said. 
“The 

strike is against all sorts of 
discrimination, not only the 
violence that kills your body, 
but the violence that kills your 
spirit.”

residents’ safety and the moral 
considerations of implementing a 
cull in the city. However, the cull 
was approved 8-1 by city council, 
and a majority of residents 
surveyed were in favor of it.

The management plan states 

that, provided non-lethal methods 
are practical and cost effective, 
the city will sterilize 40 to 60 
deer, as well as aim to kill 100 
more in the next year.

“Our goal this year is to 

evaluate these methods both 
individually 
and 
collectively 

so we can see what is a cost-
effective means of achieving the 
community’s tolerance for the 
impacts of having the deer herd in 
the area,” said City Administrator 
Howard Lazarus.

Lazarus said he believes that 

the education component presents 
a great opportunity to work with 
advocates of non-lethal method to 
find different means and methods 
to control the deer population.

The Humane Society of Huron 

Valley, an advocate for non-lethal 
means of population control, said 

this week they disapprove of the 
2017 Deer Management Plan. 
Tanya Hilgendorf, president and 
CEO of Humane Society of Huron 
Valley, said there is no absolutely 
no need for a cull.

“We 
think 
the 
plan 
is 

completely 
unnecessary 
and 

inhumane,” Hilgendorf said on 
behalf of the Humane Society. 
“We have no deer emergency in 
Ann Arbor. We have no public 
health or safety problems. The 
deer are not suffering. We don’t 
have close to an overpopulation.”

Hilgendorf also charged the 

cull goes against city values like 
tolerance and nonviolence.

“We should absolutely not 

be using violence to solve our 
problems and teaching our kids 
that when we are frustrated 
we take out our guns,” said 
Hilgendorf. “We see so much 
violence in our world against 
people and animals, and have 
so much worry every single day 
about people getting shot. Do we 
really need more shooting and 
more killing?”

As part of the 2017 plan, the 

city will develop a data collection 
plan for measuring the success 
of the lethal, non-lethal and 

educational programs. Success 
will be determined by looking 
at property damage, vehicular 
accidents and the health of the 
deer herd, looking for indications 
of Chronic Wasting disease in 
deer or Lyme disease in humans.

At Monday evening’s City 

Council meeting, the council 
also approved a first-read vote on 
two ordinances that would allow 
discharge of firearms on city 
land. Those ordinances will come 
back for a second read in front of 
the council on Nov. 14, where the 
council will also vote to approve 
a contract with White Buffalo, 
the vendor chosen to carry out 
both the lethal and non-lethal 
methods.

Lazarus 
said 
city 
officials 

have had extensive meetings and 
discussions with various groups of 
interested stakeholders, including 
animal rights activists that are 
against the cull and groups that 
are in support of thinning the deer 
population through a cull.

“They are not going to agree 

with everything we ultimately 
decide to do but they have had 
the opportunity to help us shape 
the management plan as it exists 
now,” he said.

About 40 students gathered in 

Angell Hall to watch the debate 
with the College Republicans. 
Before the debate, Randy Clark, 
a Republican candidate for state 
representative 
in 
Michigan’s 

52nd 
district 
addressed 
the 

audience, challenging students 
to vote in the election and 
further their involvement with 
politics.

“Everybody wants to run 

and hide under a rock because 
they can’t stand this mess that’s 
going on, but you really have to 
get involved, you have to make a 
difference,” he said.

At the College Republicans 

watch party, LSA sophomore 
Amanda Delekta said she found 
the debate to be an overall 
positive experience, compared 
with 
previous 
debates 
and 

campaign tactics.

“I thought that it was Trump’s 

best debate by far, I thought 
he did a lot better job staying 
on topic and not trying to talk 
over people,” Delekta said. “I 
thought that the moderator did 
a lot better job making sure each 
candidate respected the other 
person and their time. So overall 
I thought it was a nice statement 
to end a brutal campaign on both 
sides.”

However, Delekta said she 

wished 
the 
candidates 
had 

discussed 
at 
greater 
length 

the issue of Supreme Court 
justice appointment, which she 
considers to be the most pressing 
issue of this election.

“We’ll fill at least two — 

possibly three — justices, which 
is crazy for one president, and 
hasn’t been done in a long time,” 
she said. “And that’s going to 
set the direction for policy 
in America for decades and 
decades.”

In response to the question, 

Trump said he has a list of 
20 conservatives who could 
fill 
the 
seats 
as 
justices, 

emphasizing 
the 
importance 

of their close interpretation 
of 
the 
constitution, 
while 

Clinton encouraged the Senate 
to confirm President Barack 

Obama’s 
nominee, 
Merrick 

Garland.

Engineering 
freshman 

Lincoln Merrill also said he 
felt 
Trump 
performed 
well 

in this debate, citing times 
when he challenged Clinton on 
inconsistencies in her campaign.

“From a policy standpoint, 

Trump definitely won,” he said. 
“I still think he could have kept 
his cool a little better … I think 
Trump did what he needed to do 
in this debate.”

He 
added 
that 
he 
felt 

moderator Chris Wallace, host of 
“Fox News Sunday,” performed 
better 
than 
moderators 
in 

previous debates.

“He hit them both equally 

hard on different subjects, he 
was the most fair of all the 
moderators and his performance 
blew me away,” he said.

In 
Weill 
Hall, 
about 
50 

students attended a debate watch 
party 
organized 
by 
College 

Democrats, Students for Hillary 
and the Michigan Democratic 
Coordinated Campaign.

LSA senior Olivia Rau, a 

member of Students for Hillary, 
said her organization aims to 
bring awareness to the issues 
discussed during the election 
and ensure that students are well 
informed when it comes time to 
vote.

“Our main goal is to get 

students thinking and paying 
attention to the issues and 
providing a platform for them to 
get exposed to what’s happening 
in the election,” she said.

One 
point 
of 
contention 

between the candidates that 
resonated with the audience 
came toward the end of the 
debate, when Wallace asked 
the candidates how they would 
resolve dwindling funding for 
entitlement programs like Social 
Security and Medicare, which he 
said account for 60 percent of all 
federal spending.

“Social security is going to run 

out in the 2030s,” he said. “And at 
that time, recipients are going to 
take huge cuts in their benefits.”

In response to the question, 

Clinton said she planned to raise 
taxes on the wealthy and use the 
money to add to Social Security. 
In contrast, Trump pointed to 
the Affordable Care Act, saying 
he would abolish it.

“One thing we have to do: 

repeal and replace the disaster 
known as Obamacare,” Trump 
said.

Public Policy junior Katie 

Putnam said she thought this 
issue will play a large role in the 
future.

“I personally care a lot about 

the Affordable Care Act,” she 
said. “And Medicare is going to 
be huge coming up.”

Questions about the economy, 

which devolved in discussions of 
several scandals raised against 
both 
candidates, 
also 
drew 

strong 
reactions 
from 
both 

candidates.

While Trump referred to 

accusations 
about 
Clinton’s 

deletion of classified emails, 
Clinton 
brought 
up 
2006 

comments from Trump, released 
earlier this month, in which he 
bragged about touching women 
without consent.

“Donald 
thinks 
belittling 

women 
makes 
him 
bigger,” 

Clinton said. “He goes after their 
dignity, their self worth, and I 
don’t think there is a woman out 
there who doesn’t know what 
that feels like.”

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

sophomore Liliana Talwatte said 
she thought Hillary responded 
strongly to Trump’s attacks.

“I think she was fantastic,” 

she said. “She responded well (to 
Trump’s criticism).”

Putnam said that she did not 

expect Clinton to respond in a 
way that mirrored Trump’s style.

“There 
were 
some 
times 

where we were thinking that she 
was playing a little dirtier,” she 
said. “Trump was already going 

to do that himself.”

costs in light of dwindling state 
appropriation to higher education, 
the current Board of Regents 
approved a 3.9-percent tuition 
hike for in-state residents and 
4.4-percent increase for out-of-
state students this summer.

Weiser is opposed to the board’s 

decision, and has proposed a freeze 
on individual in-state tuition from 
the time students begin at the 
University. 
Fellow 
Republican 

candidate Meyers proposed similar 
actions to stop tuition increase, and 
disapproved of raising University 
President Mark Schlissel 3 percent 
in light of the increase to student 
fees.

“No one will pay more than 

they did freshman year,” he said. 
“There are always ways to spend on 
students … when we cut costs and 
find new funding sources.”

Much of Weiser’s platform 

also focuses on his background 
in philanthropy and ability to 
fundraise. On campus, the former 
Dennison Building is now named 
after Weiser’s following his $50 
million donation toward building 
renovations in December 2014. 
The 
former 
ambassador 
also 

founded the University’s Weiser 
Center for Emerging Democracies 
and the Ronald and Eileen Weiser 
Center for Europe and Eurasia 
after returning from his posting 
in Slovakia in 2008. As of this 
February, Weiser’s donations to the 
University totaled $95.9 million.

As the vice chair of the ongoing 

Victors for Michigan donation 
campaign, which aims to fundraise 
$4 billion, the largest goal of any 

campaign launched by a public 
institution of higher education, 
Weiser said increasing charitable 
contributions is a priority for him. 

“With 
philanthropy, 
we’re 

looking for a place where we can 
make a difference first in the 
world,” he said. “I can provide time 
to the University and commit to 
the fundraising responsibility as 
regent.”

Weiser’s political leanings — 

specifically his role as vice chair to 
the finance committee for Trump’s 
campaign in Michigan — have 
prompted some pushback from 
his Democratic opponents. In an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily earlier this week, Deitch 
said Weiser’s political views were 
fundamentally 
“incompatible” 

with the University, in part due to 
his support for Trump.

Speaking 
to 
his 
political 

leanings, Weiser said his focus was 
on progress.

“I support politics of change, 

and Democrats are not bringing 
change,” he said. 

Weiser’s 
other 
focus 
areas 

include socioeconomic regional 
diversity, equality between Ann 
Arbor and the University’s other 
satellite campuses in Flint and 
Dearborn and transparency in the 
board’s proceedings. Specifically, 
he plans to invest more resources 
into students on all three campuses 
by having faculty travel between 
the locations and research the best 
practices for broadening students’ 
financial backgrounds.

“We can learn a lot about each 

other,” he said. “The Board of 
Regents has the capacity to be 
more than it is … and I care about 
this University because of what it 
can do.”

period of economic growth, Lin 
said China is not struggling, but is 
merely suffering from cyclical and 
external factors that do not require 
structural changes to its economy.

“To 
make 
adjustments 
in 

economic 
structure 
is 
very 

difficult,” Lin said. “It is very 
important to understand the true 
causes … and the main reason is 
cyclical.”

However, shifting away from 

China, Lin argued that the United 
States’ economy does need to 
undergo structural changes for 
it to fully recover from the 2008 
financial crisis.

“In the short run, general 

structural reforms are important 
in raising the economic growth 
rate,” Lin said. “We need to have 
an innovative way to make the 
structural reform … and that 
requires political leadership.”

LSA junior Paul Miriani said 

Lin’s argument that the American 
economy 
requires 
structural 

changes came as a surprise.

“That is not an argument that I 

have ever heard before,” Miriani 
said. “It was a lot more critical of 
(Obama’s) administration and the 
eight years (in which) the U.S. has 
not done what is necessary is a 
different perspective.”

Ann Arbor resident Charles 

McIntosh said he wished Lin 
would have talked more about 
the differences between the U.S. 
economy before and after 2008.

“I do not think that he talked 

about it enough, and what struck 
me about the difference before 
and after 2008 is we did not talk 
about 
public 
investment 
and 

corporate investment,” McIntosh 
said. “However, I actually think 
his views fit in pretty well with a 
lot of economic views on the right 
in the United States today and I do 
not find it a particularly surprising 
suggestion that economies need to 
restructure.”

During the event, in reference to 

Chinese and American economic 
interaction, Ciorciari asked Lin 
about his thoughts regarding 
China’s exclusion from the Trans-
Pacific Partnership. The TPP is 
a trade deal involving the United 
States and 11 other Pacific Ocean 
nations, including Japan, Australia 
and Canada.

“To exclude China from the TPP 

is not a development because China 
is now one of the largest trading 
countries in the world,” Lin said. 
“I don’t think this is economically 
advisable because not only is it not 
good for China, it is not good for all 
economies.”

When asked by an audience 

member whether he thought that 
the criticism levied by politicians 
in the United States toward China 
for alleged currency manipulation 
and other unfair trade practices 
is reasonable, Lin said he believed 
that the focus of talks about United 
States-China relations should be 
about the benefits they brings to 
both countries.

“To maintain good economic 

relations is certainly good for 
China and for the U.S.,” Lin 
said. “Politicians like to find a 
scapegoat.”

architectural carvings.

“Mary’s 
work 
has 
done 

so much to both recover the 
ways that women have been 
active and engaged, especially 
intellectually, over the whole 
course of the United States as 
well as being very clear about 
the limitations that remained 
in 
terms 
of 
expectations 

of women continuing to be 
deferential or the ways in 
which women’s intellectual 
work would be filtered or 
condescended to,” Silbert said.

For her project, Silbert has 

gone to different libraries 
around campus to look at 
artifacts 
that 
show 
how 

women were able to attain 
the educational and political 
opportunities they have today, 
something that she noted has 
vast significance this election 
year.

LSA senior Michael Gawlik 

echoed Silbert’s admiration 
for Kelley, saying the best 
class he has taken so far at the 
University was Kelley’s Sex 
and Gender in U.S. History, 
1600-2000. Since taking it 
his sophomore year, Gawlik 
has developed an interest in 
women’s studies and history, 
and Kelley is now his adviser 
for his honors thesis.

Gawlik’s 
thesis 
looks 
at 

differing literature narratives 
regarding 
prostitution 
in 

the 19th century and aims 
to 
establish 
how 
social 

judgments and blame of the 
behavior shifted from book to 
book.

As a man, Gawlik said he 

has often seen misconceptions 
about women’s studies — for 
instance, the assumption that 
it is only related to feminism.

“I think sometimes women’s 

studies 
is 
misunderstood 

by 
the 
general 
population 

of students and it’s seen as 
something that you should 
only be involved in if you’re a 
woman or if you’re a feminist, 
and I think it is something 
that is just really important 
because it provides you with 
a framework — as a history 
major — for looking at the past 
differently,” Gawlik said.

Mentorship 
through 

research

How 
to 
bring 
women’s 

studies to a more mainstream 
integration on campus, Kelley 
and her students said, remains 
a slight challenge. Despite 
her extensive work in the 

field, Kelley said she does 
not think the creation of a 
women’s studies requirement 
on 
campus 
— 
much 
like 

there is a Race and Ethnicity 
requirement 
— 
would 

benefit the women’s studies 
movement. She said the idea 
of integrating women’s studies 
into history lectures would 
be beneficial, but has found 
it sometimes unsuccessful in 
practice.

“The 
problem 
with 

mainstreaming is that it can 
look like it’s an add-on as 
opposed to just being fully 
part 
of 
the 
curriculum,” 

Kelley said. “The Race and 
Ethnicity requirement is in 
terms of people learning about 
people who happened to have 
been deeply disadvantaged in 
this culture, and certainly not 
all women have been deeply 
disadvantaged … on the basis of 
sex and gender. They’ve been 
disadvantaged to a certain 
extent, but not to the same 
extent, and I think to equate 
those is not appropriate.”

Silbert 
said 
she 
felt 

conflicted about whether a 
women’s studies and Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
requirement 

could 
be 
all-encompassing, 

but generally felt it would be 
advantageous for students to 
think outside their traditional 
realm of thinking.

“There are very visible ways 

that there are gender gaps 
between programs or certain 
spaces on this campus, but I’ve 

had the experience of teaching 
Intro to Women’s Studies and 
I’ve found in those experiences 
once students had language 
for the ways that gender 

can 
influence 
everything 

students express frustration,” 
Silbert said. “But I think it’s 
a healthy frustration so much 
of women’s studies is that 
learning to see.”

Gawlik 
echoed 
the 

sentiments of both, saying the 
current gaps in knowledge 
show 
there 
is 
room 
for 

progress.

“There are a lot of gendered 

ideas in American society and 
regardless of how liberal one’s 
school is, those ideas are still 
going to be something that 
students 
have 
internalized 

when they come to this school 
and that will be part of the 
campus culture,” he said. “So I 
think that even though U of M 
is probably more progressive 
than most schools … there’s 
still progress to be made.”

W

hen most people 
throw 
something 

away, usually little 

attention is paid to what 
happens next. For most cities, 
the 
final 
resting 

spot of trash is 
a landfill, which 
is simply a large, 
coated hole in the ground 
for trash to sit for the rest of 
eternity. However, for Detroit 
residents, the final resting 
place of the most harmful 
elements of trash is in the 
lungs of the residents of 
Midtown and Poletown East. 

The city is home to Detroit 

Renewable Power, America’s 
largest 
“Waste-to-Energy” 

facility. While that sounds 
like a nice name, in actuality, 
the facility is simply a large 
furnace that runs on burned 
trash and generates electricity 
and steam. Detroit’s facility 
is located off the eastern 
edge 
of 
Midtown 
at 
the 

intersection of Interstate 94 
and Interstate 75. While many 
give it praise as an innovation 
in waste management, many 
residents refer to the tall 
grey 
smokestack 
as 
“The 

Incinerator,” 
alluding 
to 

a dirtier side of the waste 
management facility. 

Originally opened in 1986, 

the incinerator was hailed as 
a step in the right direction 
for 
waste 
reduction 
and 

environmentalism in Detroit. 
The original plan for the 
incinerator was to burn up to 
4,000 tons of trash per day and 
provide energy for more than 
60,000 homes. However, the 
population of Detroit has fallen 
about 50 percent since 1986, 
and with that, the supply of 
trash has markedly decreased. 
Faced with the dilemma of 
being unable to keep up with 
the power and steam needs of 
downtown Detroit, the facility 

— originally designed to burn 
all 
of 
Detroit’s 
household 

trash 
— 
decided 
to 
start 

importing trash from other 
municipalities and commercial 

operations. 

The 
problems 

associated 
with 

running 
a 
30-year-

old trash incinerator on waste 
it wasn’t meant to handle are 
staggering. When I visited the 
area around the incinerator, 
I was greeted with an odor 
so foul that I could barely 
walk down the street without 
gagging. Sadly, it wasn’t just 
the smell that was nauseating 
— cars whizzed by overhead on 
Interstate 94, and a constant 
stream 
of 
trash 
trucks 

rumbled by, spewing brown 
trash “juice” out of the back. 
Many studies have shown 
that despite state-mandated 
pollution controls, the levels 
of CO2, mercury, lead and 
other 
harmful 
materials 

exceed safe amounts. 

I 
spoke 
with 
William 

Copeland, 
climate 
justice 

director 
for 
the 
Eastern 

Michigan 
Environmental 

Action Council, which is an 
environmental activist group 
that is working to close the 
incinerator. 
“The 
Detroit 

Incinerator is an outdated, 
ancient facility with some of 
the least pollution controls 
of all incinerators in the 
country,” he said. 

“The owners of the facility 

show little to no concern 
for the negative health and 
environmental 
impacts 

of 
their 
facility 
on 
the 

community,” he told me as we 
walked by the incinerator’s 
looming 
smokestack. 
Many 

groups oppose the incinerator 
and have specific concerns 
about health impacts on the 
surrounding communities. 

For any community, the 

disposal of trash is a struggle. 
However, 
there 
are 
steps 

that can be taken to reduce 
waste. The City of Detroit 
only 
instituted 
curbside 

recycling in 2014, a program 
that is still underperforming, 
while composting services are 
nearly nonexistent. Even the 
placement of the incinerator 
is problematic, located right 
off the edge of the bustling 
Midtown district. This isn’t 
some place far away that 
nobody lives in, it’s right in 
the middle of a population 
center — there is even a school 
just blocks away from the 
smokestack, 
meaning 
that 

children inhale the exhaust of 
the incinerator every day. 

In order for Detroit to 

become the city of the future 
that it hopes to be, it must 
solve its waste management 
crisis. 
Incineration 
isn’t 

a 
viable 
option 
anymore, 

especially with the massive 
population losses that have 
stricken the area. 

“Detroit and the metro-

Detroit 
region 
must 
move 

toward zero waste — reducing, 
reusing, 
composting 
and 

recycling 
our 
waste,” 

Copeland 
said. 
“However, 

this can never happen as 
long as the region continues 
to be saddled (by) Detroit’s 
monster of an incinerator,” he 
continued. This is something 
that must be done, because 
the city of the future can’t 
rely on an outdated system 
of waste disposal anymore. 
Reduction of waste, recycling 
and finding alternatives to 
incineration are incredibly 
necessary for the progress of 
Detroit.

I 

don’t know about you, 
but this has been a pretty 
emotional week for me. 

Maybe 
it’s 
the 

typical 
stress 
of 

midterm 
season 

creeping 
up, 

maybe it’s the toll 
recent 
incidents 

of hate speech and 
intolerance 
on 

our campus have 
taken or maybe it’s 
something deeper. 
But as I watched 
the 
second 

presidential debate last Sunday 
night, I felt a gaping pit open 
in the middle of my stomach. 
As each minute passed, each 
punch was thrown and each 
opportunity for remorse and 
accountability was deflected, 
I succumbed to defeat. The 
America I was raised to 
believe in — the tolerant, 
hopeful, opportunity-ridden 
America they teach us about 
as kids — was dead. I went 
to bed that night terrified 
of a new era emerging in 
this country where hate and 
division reign supreme. 

But this isn’t true. Rather, 

this doesn’t have to be true. 
Right here and now, we have an 
opportunity to alter the course 
of history. We have a chance to 
denounce the negativity that 
has swept across our country 
and replace it with a positive 
vision for our future. And the 
simplest and most fundamental 
way to combat this negativity is 
through our votes. 

On Monday night, I covered 

an event at Eastern Michigan 
University where Sen. Cory 
Booker (D–N.J.) campaigned 
for 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton, along 
with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D–
Mich.), Sen. Gary Peters (D–
Mich.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell 
(D–Ann 
Arbor). 
The 
event 

truly could not have come 
at a more perfect time. I left 
feeling inspired, invigorated 
and hopeful that we can break 
this cycle of cynicism. We can 
be angry at all of the recent 
events, but as Sen. Booker 
said, we must decide that “we 
are not going to allow … our 
inability to do everything to 
undermine our determination 
to do something.” We cannot 

let ourselves fall into what 
Booker 
calls 
a 
“state 
of 

sedentary 
agitation.” 
It 
is 

one thing to discuss 
our 
anger 
at 
the 

negativity 
invading 

our country, but we 
need to channel that 
anger into action. If 
we wish to erase the 
negative, 
we 
must 

register, 
we 
must 

vote and we must 
encourage others to 
do the same. 

College 
students 

are in a unique position to make 
an incredible impact on this 
election. For many of us, this is 
the first presidential election 
in which we are eligible to 
vote. For the first time, we 
do not have to defer to our 
parents’ or our grandparents’ 
generations to determine the 
path our futures will take. 
Yet, college students in the 
past few presidential elections 
have voted at rates of about 40 
percent. In fact, young adults 
ages 18 to 24 constitute the 
group with the lowest voter 
turnout of any age group in 
this country. At the same time, 
people 65 and over vote at 
rates of nearly 70 percent. If 
we do not show up to the polls, 
we cannot complain about 
policies that have an adverse 
impact on our lives. If we do 
not vote, older generations 
will continue to drive us 
down the negative path we 
already see on the horizon. 

As 
President 
Obama 

remarked in his commencement 
address at Howard University 
in May, “When we don’t vote, 
we 
give 
away 
our 
power, 

disenfranchise 
ourselves 
— 

right when we need to use 
the power that we have; right 
when we need your power to 
stop others from taking away 
the vote and rights of those 
more vulnerable than you.” 
We cannot do everything, but 
voting is one small action we 
can take that will have huge 
implications for our futures. 

I’ve 
heard 
many 
people 

recently saying that instead 
of choosing the “lesser of two 
evils,” they are simply not 
going to vote. These people 
claim they can sacrifice the 
next four years of their lives 

and reset at the next election 
when the parties put up more 
worthy candidates. Here’s the 
reality: Millions of people in 
this country cannot afford to 
sacrifice these next four years. 
For many, this election is the 
difference 
between 
poverty 

and prosperity, employment 
and unemployment, equality 
and inequality — even life 
and death. This election will 
determine 
whether 
people 

who have lived in the United 
States their entire lives will 
be deported. This election will 
determine whether women will 
still have control over their 
own health. This election will 
determine how we see race, 
gender, sexuality and diversity 
in our country: with tolerance 
or with division. Those of us 
who have the “luxury” not 
to vote have an obligation to 
vote. As Sen. Booker asserted, 
“The most perverse type of 
privilege, the most dangerous 
type 
of 
privilege, 
is 
that 

there’s a serious problem out 
there, but because it doesn’t 
affect you personally, it’s not 
your problem.” 

If we love our country and 

still see the light amid so much 
darkness, then we must vote. 

Sen. 
Booker 
ended 
his 

speech with an excerpt from 
the poem Let America Be 
America Again by Langston 
Hughes: 

O, let America be America 

again —

The land that never has 

been yet —

And yet must be — the land 

where every man is free.

The land that’s mine — the 

poor man’s, Indian’s, Negro’s, 
ME —

Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, 

whose faith and pain,

Whose hand at the foundry, 

whose plow in the rain,

Must bring back our mighty 

dream again … 

O, yes, I say it plain,
America never was America 

to me,

And yet I swear this oath —
America will be!

Let’s bring back the positive

FROM THE DAILY

A new approach to diversity on campus
E

arlier this month, the University of Michigan launched its 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion plan, committing $85 million over 
the next five years to “a vibrant, diverse and inclusive campus.” 

Though the University makes significant strides with the plan, the 
loudest voice in it is that of bureaucracy. While there are several 
important aspects to the DEI initiative, we feel that the number one 
strategy to creating a better campus climate, which the DEI plan largely 
falls short of, starts with the foundation of the curriculum we learn in 
our classrooms. The ideal curriculum doesn’t dilute the importance of 
diversity, equity and inclusion to a singular course requirement, skit 
or event at the beginning of one’s freshman year, but rather infuses it 
into curricula of all courses and course structures campuswide, over 
the span of students’ time at the University.

The central weakness in 

the 
administration’s 
DEI 

initiative is that rather than 
taking this opportunity to 
innovate 
and 
incorporate 

student perspectives on what 
has and has not been working 
and rethink its approach to 
diversity, it doubles down on 
tired strategies that sound 
good on paper but fail to 
achieve real change. While 
the construction of a new 
Trotter Multicultural Center, 
an expansion of the Wolverine 
Pathways program to engage 
with K-12 students in Detroit 
and devoting financial support 
to 
departments 
conducting 

research on diversity are all 
good steps the plan outlines, 
these are not the steps that 
will contribute to tangibly 
changing the campus climate. 

Perhaps the chief example of 

the failure of the DEI to make 
substantive changes lies in its 
plan to implement a cultural 
sensitivity training initiative. 
Through 
this 
program, 

incoming 
freshman 
classes 

will be required to fill out an 
assessment of their cultural 
sensitivity, complete a unique 
training program based on 
their results and receive a 
certificate for completion. An 
online test at the beginning 
of freshman year will not 
be sophisticated enough to 
accurately indicate whether 
or not a student is sufficiently 
culturally sensitive to be a 
respectful 
member 
of 
our 

University community.

By opting for this method, 

the University is assuming that 
the best strategy in promoting 
diversity is to concentrate 
this education in the first few 
weeks a student is on campus. 
In reality, this period of time 
is far from ideal in terms of 
communicating a message — 
students are worried about 
making 
friends, 
starting 

classes and getting acquainted 
with Ann Arbor. What’s more, 
many 
students 
may 
know 

how to go through the online 
motions and provide the “right 
answer” 
when 
prompted, 

simply to get the test over with. 

Discussing 
diversity 
is 

an obvious important step 
in introducing students to 
campus, but the first few 
weeks 
of 
freshman 
year 

should not be the first and last 
time students are required 

to reflect on and learn about 
cultural sensitivity. Someone 
won’t 
learn 
about 
implicit 

biases, harmful stereotypes or 
discrimination through a quiz. 
That shift will only happen 
through a more comprehensive 
redesign of how professors 
teach and what ideas and 
perspectives are incorporated 
into each course’s curriculum.

The 
University 
should 

mandate that all curriculums 
in all classes across all schools 
and colleges are reevaluated by 
professors to include material 
that provides other narratives 
besides 
the 
dominant 
one 

typically 
taught 
in 
the 

discipline. Many classes do 
this already, but a significant 
number do not, and many of 
the ones that do fail to do it 
as thoroughly as they should. 
When reading lists and syllabi 
are 
made, 
teachers 
must 

include voices of scholars and 
authors from varying minority 
backgrounds in their field. 
When lecture topics are picked, 
professors should make an 
explicit effort to cover the 
works and thoughts of minority 
groups who may have been 
ignored or underrepresented in 
previous curricula. 

That 
said, 
incorporating 

themes 
and 
content 
that 

include diverse perspectives 
into an LSA syllabus is easier 
than incorporating them into 
a syllabus in the College of 
Engineering or Ross School 
of Business, because course 
content in these schools is 
less likely to relate to issues 
surrounding diversity directly. 
However, by shining a light on 
diversity, professors and GSIs 
— regardless of their discipline 
— can transform what would 
otherwise 
be 
a 
one-time 

push at the beginning of a 
student’s freshman year into 
the starting point for themes 
that span across every year. 
And it is imperative that each 
faculty member and GSI in 
every school on campus work 
toward 
goals 
of 
including 

diverse perspectives into not 
only their syllabi, but also in 
the way that the classroom 
environment is structured. 

The LSA DEI plan, like 

many at universities across 
the 
country, 
requires 
the 

development of trainings and 
DEI sessions for professors 
and GSIs to better facilitate 

issues 
of 
identity 
and 

representation in classrooms. 
Changes like these should be 
applauded. In the classroom, 
faculty members play the most 
vital role in how students 
participate in class, and in 
turn, how they learn in class. 
Teachers must be cognizant of 
how their teaching styles affect 
students differently and then 
must also be good facilitators 
of discussions that include all 
voices. Only when all students 
are comfortable enough to 
share 
their 
perspective 
is 

everyone in the classroom 
benefiting 
fully 
from 
the 

educational experience. 

As 
well, 
more 
thought 

should be put into the methods 
that 
promote 
continued 

self-reflection 
on 
one’s 

identity, such as a program 
for sophomore year, one that 
reinforces and builds on what 
is learned in the first few 
weeks of school. The Race and 
Ethnicity requirement should 
continue to be re-evaluated, 
and 
should 
be 
expanded 

beyond LSA, because themes 
about how to relate to others, 
be 
respectful 
and 
take 

advantage of the diversity this 
University community has to 
offer are equally relevant to 
those 
studying 
engineering 

or business or kinesiology. 
These ideas must be infused 
into each course curriculum 
campuswide in order to start 
to witness the kind of change 
to campus climate for which 
the DEI plan is calling. 

Promoting diversity at a 

large, public university is a 
daunting task, and the DEI 
initiative takes steps toward 
progress. Unfortunately, this 
progress 
is 
overshadowed 

by 
an 
administration 
that 

seems 
more 
willing 
to 

rebrand existing initiatives, 
rather than do the work of 
stepping back, reassessing its 
approach and implementing a 
more progressive strategy to 
accomplish diversity, equity 
and inclusion on campus. This 
would 
require 
substantial 

changes to the ways issues and 
discussions of diversity are 
integrated into curriculum and 
new training for faculty about 
structural 
and 
atmospheric 

changes to classes that will 
highlight 
diverse 
groups 

of 
people 
and 
different 

perspectives.

After three games, ‘M’ 
still unclear on goalie

A central question for the 

2016-17 Michigan hockey team 
revolves 
around 
goaltending. 

After last year’s primary starter 
Steve Racine graduated, the 
Wolverines were left with three 
goalies who all carry question 
marks into the crease.

Senior 
Zach 
Nagelvoort 

brought the most experience, but 
he was inconsistent last season. 
Freshman Hayden Lavigne was 
once a heralded recruit, but after 
a few tough years in the United 
States Hockey League, he wasn’t 
necessarily a sure bet to start, 
either. Freshman Jack LaFontaine 
was a highly rated recruit in 
his own right, but he isn’t as 
experienced as the other two.

Now, three games into the 

season, all three have had the 
chance to start, but the situation 
still isn’t any clearer.

“I can’t tell you there’s a plan 

that’s in stone,” said Michigan 
coach 
Red 
Berenson. 
“It’s 

probably going to take a while for 
us to sort out the three goalies 
that have played. I told them, 
‘This could go on all year, it could 
go on for half of the year,’ but 
we’ll see. But I’m pretty open-
minded.”

The 
uncertainty 
doesn’t 

bother the players themselves, 
either. Nagelvoort said at the 
beginning of the season that he 
enjoyed the competition among 
the three goaltenders, and on 
Wednesday, he echoed a similar 
sentiment.

“I 
would 
say 
nothing’s 

changed,” Nagelvoort said. “I’ve 
known, and … they’ve known, 
that no one is guaranteed ice 
time, and that’s what’s going to 
drive us to be the best we can be 

this year.

“I said that we have a 

competitive group of guys, and 
that we have three different 
guys who can play on Friday and 
Saturday night and that’s going to 
help me to be better, help Jack to 
be better and help Hayden to be 
better, and all we’ve seen is that.”

The 
play 
of 
the 
three 

goaltenders has been important 
for the Wolverines so far, and 
it will likely continue to be 
for the rest of the year. A solid 
performance from a goalie can 
cover up mistakes made by the 
rest of the team, and given how 
young Michigan’s roster is this 
season, the netminder is crucial 
to the team’s performance.

This was especially evident in 

Saturday’s game against Ferris 
State. 
The 
Bulldogs 
outshot 

Michigan, 29-16, and dominated 
possession throughout the game. 
But 
thanks 
to 
LaFontaine’s 

stellar performance in net, the 
Wolverines were able to stay even 
throughout and eked out a win in 
the end, 2-1.

Those performances don’t just 

happen, though. The goalies all 
have to be ready, no matter when 
their number is called.

“That’s 
not 
up 
to 
us,” 

Nagelvoort said. “So it’s not really 
something you worry yourself 
about. It’s just kind of just more 
that you prepare yourself for 
every game.”

So far, the goalies have been 

solid. Even when Nagelvoort 
gave up four goals in the team’s 
season-opening loss to Union, he 
was peppered with 40 shots.

Though nobody has separated 

themselves as the sure starter, 
that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. 
For now, Michigan believes all 
three are capable of getting the 
job done. 

ICE HOCKEY

MIKE PERSAK
Daily Sports Writer

Michigan hoping summer progress carries over

Nicole Munger knew she would 

be going over the summer to 
Disney World — she goes every 
year with her family.

What the sophomore guard 

didn’t expect was that she would 
run into her teammate, junior 
forward Jillian Dunston, on the 
trip.

It was a chance encounter for 

both Munger and Dunston, but 
shows how the two Wolverines 
value the physical and mental 
break in the summers from the 
daily grind of being a collegiate 
athlete.

“You have to be able to do both 

academics and athletics,” Dunston 
said. “Academics are supposed to 
come first, but you have to find a 
balance. It can be tough, but you 
do your best. I think going home 
is beneficial both mentally and 
physically. You just need a break.” 

Many members of the team stay 

in Ann Arbor through the spring 
and summer terms, which makes 
going home for an extended period 
of time a welcome reprieve. 

But, 
the 
Wolverines 
don’t 

forget to stay in shape. At the 
end of each season, the coaches 
meet with every player to go over 
a set of attainable goals for the 
upcoming year. Sophomore center 
Hallie Thome took her review in 
stride. 

“I worked on strength and 

conditioning,” Thome said. “So 
I’ll definitely be able to combat 
the strength of the Big Ten that 
everyone has. As a freshman, I 
knew that was a big thing that I 
was going to have to get used to, 
so as a sophomore, being able to 
come in and surprise the Big Ten, 
even though it might not look like 
I gained a lot of muscle, it’s there.”

Thome earned a spot on the 

Big 
Ten 
All-Freshman 
Team 

last 
season, 
finishing 
second 

nationally in field goal percentage 

(63.1). Though she has impressive 
offensive skills, Thome is working 
toward “making a change on the 
defensive end.” 

Older players also benefit from 

the 
comprehensive 
nature 
of 

the review. They recognize the 
invaluable efforts by their coaches, 
especially Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico, 
to 
help 
them 

improve. 

“It’s awesome to have a coach 

behind you on everything you 
do,” said senior guard Danielle 
Williams. “She’s an extraordinary 
person, just who she is and what 
she’s able to do and stands for, and 
her basketball IQ. She comes in 
every day with such a wonderful 
attitude.” 

Barnes Arico is entering her 

fifth season in Ann Arbor. She is 
the first head coach to record four 

straight 20-win seasons and will 
return her full coaching staff for a 
third straight season. 

Williams is one of four returning 

starters, along with Thome, junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty, senior 
guard Siera Thompson.

On the other end of the 

spectrum, Michigan will also 
welcome five newcomers to the 
team — four freshmen and one 
redshirt junior, 6-foot-5 volleyball 
player Abby Cole. 

Two of the freshmen already 

know each other quite well, as 
guard Akienreh Johnson and 
forward KeAsja Peace both come 
from Toledo, Ohio. 

“I’ve 
known 
(Peace) 
since 

fourth grade, so the fact that we 
have been blessed to keep moving 
forward together means a lot,” 
Johnson said. “Not many people 

get to go to college with their best 
friend. And not many people get to 
go to Michigan and play basketball 
with their best friend.” 

Upperclassmen like Munger, 

Dunston, Thome and Williams 
have the benefit of at least one 
season behind them to help sturdy 
themselves going into the summer. 
But for Johnson and her fellow 
freshmen, the transition to college 
life can be difficult. They used the 
summer to learn how to juggle an 
athletic career as a college student. 
Johnson credits her teammates, 
including Peace, for making the 
transition smoother. 

With the season opener fast 

approaching on Nov. 12, the 
athletes will have to rely on their 
summer experience and workouts 
to push forward into the new 
season ahead.

‘M’ outlasts Terps in five-set match

Heading 
into 
intermission 

against then-No. 1 Wisconsin on 
Saturday, the Michigan volleyball 
team 
dug 

itself 
into 

a 
2-0 

deficit, and 
the Wolverines did so again at 
Maryland on Wednesday. The 
similarities between the two 
matches just about ended there.

Saturday, in the confines of 

Cliff Keen Arena, Michigan came 
within two points of pulling off its 
first upset of a top-ranked team 
in program history. Wednesday, 
in a harsh road environment, the 
Wolverines (6-3 Big Ten, 17-4 
overall) only managed to survive, 
staving off two late match points 
to outlast the reeling Terrapins 
(0-9 Big Ten, 8-13 overall), 3-2.

“It was a different match in 

the sense that we went down 
2-0 because we didn’t execute 
very well,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “It was a little bit 
different than Wisconsin. I think 
Wisconsin executed really well 
those first two sets, and that kind 
of put us down, where this one we 
were really chaotic.”

Saturday, Michigan emerged 

from the locker room a different 
team, fighting back to tie the 
match at two sets apiece before 
dropping the final set, 15-13.

In College Park, Rosen’s team 

found itself in a deafening gym, 
sitting in a different locker room 
and facing a different emotion.

“I think there was some shock — 

no question,” Rosen said. “I think 
there was certainly some (looking) 
around the room, and nobody 
expected to be in that position. But 
I also think there was some calm 
reason in people going, ‘Hey, we 
know what we need to do.’ I think 
we had a good game plan, and I 
think everybody clearly believed in 
themselves, or they wouldn’t have 
been able to come back and win 
those next ones.”

Michigan needed every point, 

but in the end, the Wolverines 
avoided a major letdown. A block 

by Claire Kieffer-Wright and Ally 
Davis saved one match point, 
and a kill by Carly Skjodt saved 
another. Back-to-back Maryland 
errors gave Michigan the win, 
and Rosen high-fived his wife 
and assistant coach, Leisa, while 
his team embraced in a huddle of 
excitement and relief.

After 
the 
Wolverines 
beat 

Maryland two weekends ago 
at Cliff Keen Arena, 3-1, Rosen 
warned his team that this trip 
might be difficult — though, he 
conceded, he did not expect to 
start down 2-0. Michigan’s hope 
was to string together some long 
early runs to bounce back from the 
loss to Wisconsin. But it never had 
that chance.

The 

Wolverines 
missed six serves 
in each of the 
first two sets — 
including 
the 

final 
point 
in 

each — thwarting 
any opportunity 
to 
take 
hold 

of 
the 
match. 

Meanwhile, 
the 

Terrapins blitzed 
them with kills on the first three 
points and seized all of the 
momentum in their loud home 
gym.

“The beginning of the match, 

they jumped on us a little bit, and 
then it just got chaotic because 
it’s so loud and so just frenetic,” 
Rosen said. “I just thought that we 
really lost our composure a little 
bit in that. And that happens. It’s 
not like a video game — there’s a 
human factor.”

The intensity in the gym caught 

the Wolverines off guard. Even 
during timeouts, Rosen said, they 
could hardly hear each other. 
Again given the opportunity to go 
to intermission and regroup, they 
did so. They shored up their serve 
issues, not committing any errors 
in the next two sets. And they 
passed better, forcing Maryland 
into some miscues of its own.

It took more than an hour, but 

Michigan started to play the game 
it traveled to College Park to play. 

The Wolverines took the third set, 
25-18, and jumped out to a 14-3 
lead to control the fourth.

They 
received 
a 
host 
of 

contributions. 
With 
Maryland 

locked in on Michigan’s top 
attacker, senior Abby Cole, Davis 
led the Wolverines with 16 kills. 
Kieffer-Wright added 14, and 
Mahlke 
contributed 
12. 
Cole 

managed just eight, yet Michigan 
generated enough offense to win.

“I think the big thing is slowing 

the pace down, making sure they’re 
playing at their own pace,” Rosen 
said. “I think when you can’t get 
verbal communication, I think it’s 
really important to get eye contact 
and find ways to communicate and 
connect with your teammates, and 

I don’t think we 
did that well in the 
first two sets.”

Heading 
into 

another 
home 

showdown 
Saturday 
night 

against 
Penn 

State, a win was 
all the Wolverines 
needed. 
Rosen 

knows 
how 

valuable those are 

in the Big Ten and also how close 
his team was to picking up a big 
one last weekend.

“After the Wisconsin match, 

there’s no question — it stung,” 
Rosen said. “It hurts a little bit. 
But when we came in for practice 
on Monday, I thought everybody 
was ready to go and ready to focus 
on the next match.”

The Wolverines’ next challenge 

is to avoid the early deficit that 
nearly 
plagued 
them 
again 

Wednesday. They play six more 
road games this year, the next one 
coming next Friday in a similar 
environment at Purdue.

For now, Michigan can move on 

with some momentum — no small 
task given its schedule.

“They know this conference 

is a meat grinder,” Rosen said. 
“You’re going to have that day 
in and day out, so I think they’re 
mature enough to know that hey, 
you gotta put it away and move 
onto the next one.”

As Peppers excels, Woodson comparisons arise

A name came up Tuesday at 

Schembechler Hall, one that 
doesn’t come up too often in 
comparisons.

That name is etched on the 

list of Heisman Trophy winners 
forever, as Jabrill Peppers’ 
could be as well this December. 
The name constantly made 
headlines and highlight reels 
for 
electrifying 
plays, 
as 

Peppers does. The name is in 
the Michigan football record 
books a handful of times, as 
Peppers already is.

Charles Woodson does not 

have many peers in Michigan 
football history when it comes 
to the impact he made on games 
from 1995 to 1997. But as Peppers 
stars on defense, dabbles on 
offense, flips the field on special 
teams and vaults his name into 
Heisman 
consideration, 
the 

comparisons become harder and 
harder to ignore.

Peppers, 
now 
a 
redshirt 

sophomore, said before he arrived 
at Michigan from Paramus (N.J.) 
Catholic that he wanted to be the 
best player in program history. 
The road to that title goes through 
Woodson, among others. Peppers 
was quick to credit the future 
Hall of Famer when a reporter 
brought him up, saying he didn’t 
fully understand what an impact 
Woodson made until he started 
college football.

“Charles Woodson, if you 

just look at what he did for his 
teams, it’s just mind-boggling,” 
Peppers said. “In high school, I 
used to embrace all that. Now 
that I’m actually playing at this 
level, seeing what he’s able to 
accomplish and do for his team, 
take away half the field, and 
people scared to throw at him 
— big-time plays in big-time 
moments.”

Peppers 
used 
to 
love 

being considered in the same 
conversation. 
He 
admits 
he 

followed all of the media coverage 

while he was ranked as one of the 
top recruits in the nation during 
high school.

Now, in a much bigger spotlight 

as a Michigan star, Peppers says 
he tries to avoid the attention as 
much as he can.

“I found myself trying to 

… I wasn’t happy with that,” 
Peppers said. “I was trying to 
make everybody happy, trying 
to impress too many people, 
and then you’re not happy. … 
Whatever people say about me, I 
appreciate it. You’re watching, so 
I must be doing something right.”

The biggest obstacle now is that 

the discussions are undeniable.

Peppers earns commendation 

from 
his 
head 
coach, 
Jim 

Harbaugh, 
who 
officially 

launched 
Peppers’ 
Heisman 

campaign Oct. 8 at Rutgers after 
Peppers ran for two touchdowns 
as 
a 
wildcat 
quarterback. 

Two weeks earlier, Harbaugh 
delivered the understatement of 
the year when he smiled and said 
Peppers was “good at football.”

He also draws praise from 

his teammates, including fifth-
year senior offensive tackle Erik 
Magnuson, who called Peppers 
the best player he had ever 
seen. And he gets it from those 
who have been around him for 
years, such as Chris Partridge, 
Michigan’s 
linebackers 
and 

special 
teams 

coordinator and 
Peppers’ 
high 

school 
coach 

at 
Paramus 

Catholic.

By all accounts, 

the 
21-year-

old 
appears 
to 

manage it well.

“Jabrill 
was 

an All-American as a freshman 
in high school, so he’s had, on 
a smaller scale, the same type 
of hype around him and the 
same things that have come to 
it,” Partridge said. “He’s able to 
handle it and focus, and the thing 
that Jabrill does best is he focuses 

on every play or every minute 
of a meeting like it’s the most 
important thing. That’s what 

makes him who 
he is.”

Partridge 

said 
he 
has 

never 
seen 
a 

limit to Peppers’ 
capacity, 
but 

Michigan keeps 
testing him. In 
the last game, 
Peppers played 
his most offense 
of the season. 

On one play, he even planned to 
throw the ball, an indication that 
more tricks may be yet to come.

Peppers still tries to augment 

his skill set, too. Tuesday in 
practice, Partridge said Peppers 
was sitting out for a play and 
watched former high school 

teammate and defensive end 
Rashan Gary make a move 
on the pass rush to get to the 
quarterback. Peppers went up to 
Gary after the play and asked if 
he could show him the move later.

“If he makes a mistake, for 

example, 
it’s 
unbelievable,” 

Partridge said. “Because if he 
makes a mistake, it’s only going 
to happen once, probably in his 
whole life. He fixes it.

“He also tries to make sure 

his teammates don’t make that 
same mistake. That’s the type of 
player he is. So we’ve used him on 
offense as a decoy, and he might 
be dead tired because he just ran 
an 18-play drive (on defense), and 
then he goes in and he has to run a 
fake jet sweep or something. He’s 
not getting the ball. He’s running 
it 100 miles per hour. Your team 
sees that.”

Peppers himself tries to stay 

humble — he said Tuesday he 
would give himself a C-minus for 
his performance in the first half 
of the season.

But as the season goes on, 

Peppers’ numbers continue and 
the Heisman talks intensify, the 
connections between him and 
Woodson will only intensify, and 
Peppers doesn’t deny his own 
ability. At one point Tuesday, he 
even indulged the temptation to 
compare.

“What I might agree with or 

where I might say I edge him 
is athleticism,” Peppers said. 
“He’s a little taller, rangier guy 
than I am. But I feel like if we 
was to race, if I was born back 
in the day, I probably feel like I 
would beat him in a race.”

Maybe some comparisons 

are inevitable.

“You’re watching, 

so I must be 

doing something 

right.”

Michigan assistants 
thrive in compeition

Linebackers 
coach 
Chris 

Partridge and tight ends coach 
Jay Harbaugh learn from each 
other as much as possible. 
Both are relative newcomers to 
coaching NCAA football, and 
they both help coach special 
teams, so that shouldn’t come as 
much of a surprise. 

What may be even less 

surprising is that this culture 
of learning spawns from a 
competition-rules-all 
culture 

in 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh’s staff.

When 
Jay 
coaches 
the 

field goal unit, Partridge does 
everything in his power to 
make sure his own unit blocks 
the 
kick. 
Then, 
after 
the 

competition, the two will study 
what they can do better.

According 
to 
Partridge, 

competition is an important 
aspect 
in 
everything 
the 

assistant coaches do, from 
having the strongest work 
ethic to recruiting the best 
young talent. That’s just part 
of working on a staff led by 
Harbaugh, who only wants 
highly competitive coaches.

“Jim is not demanding in 

terms of setting the hours,” 
Partridge 
said 
Wednesday. 

“He’s demanding (that) the 
people he hires love what they 
do, and they work hard at it. 
So there is no ‘Oh, I’m going to 
sleep in today.’ It’s ‘I’m going to 
pop up, I’m going to get in that 
office, I’m going to work late, 
I’m going to make sure these 
kids are prepared for the game 
or prepared for life.’ Whether 
it’s doing class checks or calling 
recruits or whatever it may be, 
it’s an atmosphere of just loving 
to work.”

Partridge first joined the 

Michigan football team as a 
director of player personnel 
in recruiting in January 2015, 
and a year later, was named the 
linebackers coach. He jumped 

onto to the NCAA scene after 
coaching at Paramus Catholic 
(N.J.) High School (the alma 
mater of freshman defensive 
end Rashan Gary and redshirt 
sophomore linebacker Jabrill 
Peppers).

There’s a great deal of 

adjustment that comes with 
that transition, and it appears 
Partridge couldn’t have landed 
in a better environment.

“I feel like I’m becoming a 

better coach,” Partridge said. 
“You go into the bye week 
and you reflect on all of the 
players and individuals and 
your schemes and everything, 
but also, I was able to reflect 
on where I’ve come from. I just 
feel like on a constant basis, I’m 
becoming better. And coaches 
are allowed to improve, too.” 

A position on Harbaugh’s 

coaching staff entails a lot of 
hours. Partridge says, “We’re 
here early, we’re out late,” 
but that’s not because of a set 
schedule that requires the 
coaches to spend every waking 
hour at Schembechler Hall. 
Rather, it stems from a desire to 
continually develop. 

“When you have a guy that’s 

leading you put in as much 
work as he does and continue 
to push, you’re not going to 
slack off,” Partridge said. “Is it 
demanding? Yes. Does it feel 
demanding? No. Do you get 
tired? No, I don’t, personally. I 
don’t think we do because we 
just love what we do.”

Partridge’s job description 

requires him to improve his 
linebackers unit, but he also 
maintains how critical it is to 
develop the players on his team, 
whether that’s preparing them 
for the NFL or life after football.

“If you want to become a 

better football coach, find your 
way on Jim Harbaugh’s staff. 
That’s really what the culture 
sets. It’s the same thing with a 
player. If you want to become a 
better young man, play for Jim 
Harbaugh.”

We’re gonna build a wall and Pink Floyd is gonna pay for it.

Ten prominent rectangular 

windows, 
often 
coupled 

in twos or threes; a single, 
decorative glass eye in the 
center; two protruding columns 
announcing the porch; yes, 
yes indeed, this is, objectively 
speaking, relatively horrifying. 
I will give Wes Craven that. 
Choosing this house, as opposed 
to the swaths of other stately 
suburban homes all lined along 
Lincoln Avenue, was by and 
large the right choice. (Whether 
other such artistic choices in 
“Scream 4” were equally as 
potent is up for debate, and by 
debate I mean general critical 
consensus would have us to 
believe that the lion’s share of 
other choices he made were, on 
the whole, a failure).

Given 
the 
calendar 
date, 

the increasingly glum faces of 
people on the street, and the 
faint Wilhelm scream my bank 
account makes at the sight of 
Espresso Royale, it’s safe to 
assume that Fall is here, and 
so, therefore, is Halloween. A 
controversial holiday, perhaps 
— less so for the satanic under-
tones and more so for the inevi-
table rifts among parents and 
children which will arise when, 
you know what I heard, Tommy 
and Cathy next door are trick-
or-treating for UNICEF, now 
isn’t that great? What wonder-
ful children they are, truly. How 
giving, how selfless. Now kids, 
wouldn’t you want to be that 
selfless? No, mom, I don’t, I just 
want my damn Now-and-Laters.

The predictable destruction 

of the nuclear family aside, Hal-
loween is a great holiday. It’s the 
only one which seems to rec-
ognize that even when we say 
we don’t, everyone loves to be 
afraid. It’s primal, and now that 
we’ve decided as a society that 
living fully clothed and hav-
ing our food served to us on an 
Ikea plate is preferable to hunt-
ing down wildebeests, we need 
some of that primal feeling in 
our meek, weak lives.

So in celebration of the holi-

day, I decided that I needed to 
experience some of my own 
primal fear. Not just some con-
trived sound effects and fake 
screams — some real, instinc-
tual, 
out-in-the-actual-world 

fear. For those who don’t know, 
or really even care, parts of 
“Scream 4” were filmed in our 
very own Ann Arbor. Figuring 
that a horror director would 
know where to find some fear, I 
paid a visit to that filming loca-
tion along Lincoln Avenue (I 
won’t divulge the exact address 
out of concern that some creep 
would walk all the way out there 
for the sole purpose of staring at 
the setting of a fictional hor-
ror movie, which is just a house 
that real people live in, so stop 
staring at their home, creeps). 
But realizing that staring at an 
unknowing family’s home for 
an inordinate amount of time 
would probably lead to some 
uncomfortable interaction with 
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment, I quickly realized I need-
ed a new plan.

How else could I experience 

that real, primal fear? Accord-
ing to World Star Hip Hop, my 
most trusted news source ever 
since the New York Times start-
ed to cause me visceral, physi-
cal reactions, Killer Clowns 
are having a bit of a field day. 
They’ve been sighted by schools, 
outside homes and in those 
creepy woods your mom told 
you not to go to, so I set out to 
see if I could coax one of these 
fiends to come give me a good 
old fight-or-flight response to 
really get the heart pumping.

Always concerned with aes-

thetics, I needed everything to 
be perfect for this hypotheti-
cal Killer Clown interaction. I 
imagine Elliot Smith is playing 
in the headphones of someone 
who gets jumped by a murder-
ous, Halloween-inspired mad-
man — he’s sparse enough so 
that the details of such an event 
can be heard as clearly as they 
need to be (not too clearly, but at 
least with some sense of clarity) 
and melancholy enough that the 
aesthetic of the event wouldn’t 
be too generally disturbed by 
the music playing in the vic-
tim’s headphones. Elliot Smith 
it was. Everything else seemed 
to check out: alone, occasionally 
sad-looking Jewish kid whose 
hair looked really good this eve-
ning just in case he was in for an 
attack.

I reach the nearest park — the 

first place where I assumed I 
could find some Killer Clowns. 
Looking 
around, 
I 
don’t, 

unfortunately, 
immediately 

see any, so I do some walking, 
hunting for a good killing. Alas, 
they don’t seem to be here on 
this particular Tuesday night, 
so I move on, though I did 
find a bunch of hooligan high 
schoolers all hanging around 
a 
playground, 
which 
was, 

obviously, just as horrifying.

I decide I need to put myself 

into the oversized red Converse 
shoes of a Killer Clown — really 
try understand their psyche. 
If I was a Killer Clown, what 
would I like? Homicide, clearly, 
but also, perhaps, a bit of fun. 
Where could I find such a thing 
in this godforsaken town? I’d 
once heard that Pinball Pete’s 
was a provider for the swaths 
of angsty high schoolers and 
the 
even 
larger 
swaths 
of 

angsty Metal Frat members, so 
I decided to change my course 
and give it a try.

“You’re 
a 
winner! You’re 

a winner! You’re a winner!” 
Jesus Christ, this is horrifying 
— perfect. I’m attacked by 
stimuli on every end, and in 
every sense. There’s a chorus of 
jingles, coins, and an awkward 
teen couple trying to figure 
out intimacy in a corner. But I 
hone in my focus: I must find 
a clown. No, not ill-prepared 
GSIs, or everyone who has ever 
lived in or interacted with East 
Quad — a Killer Clown. Focus, 
focus. Besides the increasingly 
uncomfortable teen couple, I 
don’t find anyone who fits the 
bill. I consider asking the bored 
looking, 
scraggly-bearded 

man behind the prize counter 
for some tips, but I haven’t 
interacted with another human 
in at least an hour, and I couldn’t 
ruin that now. I move on.

I become all too aware as 

I walk down the street that 

everyone seems to be staring at 
me. Or is it that I’m just staring 
at them, actually being aware 
of my surroundings? It’s hard 
to tell. Either way, people are 
looking at me, and it’s definitely 
fulfilling 
the 
goal 
of 
the 

escapade, which was to become 
so frightened that I’m rendered 
immobile. But that causes more 
staring, so I figure I ought to 
just keep going.

Completely consumed by this 

discovery — but it’s OK, because 
my hair looked good anyways 
— I realize that I somehow 
have ended up in the Diag. Who 
knew? I seem to be running 
into every kind of clown but 
the one I’m after (killer), but 
since I’m here, I figure I might 
as well give it the college try 
and do some perusing. Again, I 
don’t see a six-foot tall sharp-
toothed knife-wielding clown 
like I was hoping. I begin to 
wonder whether this whole 
clown business isn’t going to 
materialize; if, just this once, 
the internet lied to me.

But all isn’t lost in the realm 

of crippling fear. I’m beginning 
to see the happenings around 
me with a newfound sheer 
terror. A girl walks by, turns 
angrily 
to 
her 
friend 
and 

complains, “literally his only 
hobby is smoking weed with his 
idiot friends.” Which is more 
terrifying: that this girl just 
doesn’t seem to understand the 
sacredness of male bonding, or 
that male bonding does seem 
to generally and innately have 
staunch undertones of laziness 
to it? Existentially, I’m in crisis 
mode. My hands are shaking. 
I can’t keep stopping in the 
middle of the street, dammit.

When I finally gather myself, 

I start to pass the all-female 
dormitories by the Union. What 
goes on in there I don’t know, 
but whatever it is I’m sure it 
would make me shudder. Group 
chants? The burning of phallic 
symbols? Satanic rituals? Hell, 
I’m already shuddering (and 
enjoying it of course). And 
there’s a couple holding hands 
— I’m not sure I’m going to keep 
it together. I’m wonderfully 
distraught, horrified. Don’t they 
know that love was invented by 
Hallmark? Why didn’t she have 
the sense to make him change 
out of that ill-fitting letter 
jacket? Doesn’t he understand 
that when they’re not together 
she sits around a table at 
Aventura while all her friends 
try to convince her that he’s 
no good? That literally his only 
hobby is smoking weed with 
his idiot friends? That she can’t 
keep pretending to be a Raiders 
fan just to make him happy? 
Don’t they get it? 

I’ve 
practically 
completed 

my walk by this time. I almost 
get run over by a Jeep Grand 
Cherokee, which amounts to 
be the least interesting part of 
the evening. No Killer Clowns 
were found, but I did manage to 
scare the shit out of myself more 
than a few times, so I’d rank it 
to be one of my more successful 
Tuesday nights.

It turns out that you don’t 

need a contrived new click-
bait phenomenon to celebrate 
Halloween the right way — 
just some time with your own 
thoughts.

FEAR
From Page 1A

In my room, there is a colos-

sal poster that encompasses the 
entirety of one wall. Printed 
over a brick wall background, 
it consists of every single song 
(and the corresponding lyrics) 
from Pink Floyd’s The Wall 
album. The poster came with 
a corresponding record, which 
was given to me for my 18th 
birthday by my mother. She 
winked handing me the record 
and the poster over my celebra-
tory dinner, and while the rest 
of my family members did not 
understand why I clutched both 
items so reverently, I knew my 
mother and I were both think-
ing back to the same memory:

The year is 2006, and my mom 

had just picked me up from the 
bane of my 4th grade existence 
(violin lessons). We are driving 
home. It is a gorgeous fall day, 
and sunlight is filtering through 
the windows, striking the air 
around me to gold. At a red light, 
my mom abruptly changes the 
“Top 40 Hits” (much to my 
pre-teen dismay) that had been 
playing on the radio to a song I 
had never heard before: “Hey 
You” by Pink Floyd.

The song was dark with a 

cutting guitar baseline layered 
with disturbing lyrics, and I 
was confused as to why my gen-
tile mom seemed to genuinely 
enjoy a song that contained the 
line “and the worms ate into his 
brain.”

I pulled my legs into the cra-

dle of my chest and rested my 
head on my knees as I looked 
over at my mom in the driv-
ers seat. The dreariness of the 
song was completely at odds 
with the brightness in the car 
and the brightness in my mom’s 
eyes. A soft, contemplative 
smile played at the corner of 
her mouth while she off-hand-
edly tapped her fingers on the 
steering wheel in time to the 
beat of the song.

I had never seen this side 

of my mother before, which I 
guess is what prompted me to 
quickly reach over and grab her 
free hand resting on the arm-

rest between us. She glanced 
over and beamed at me, and 
I remember in that moment I 
was struck by how perfectly 
connected we seemed to be; 
I didn’t know why this song 
was so important to her, or 
even what the lyrics meant, 
but I did know how, paradoxi-
cally, everything seemed to fit 
so faultlessly together in that 
sunlight-drowned car, on that 
random fall afternoon.

That afternoon in the car 

helped me realize how little I 
actually knew about the woman 
my mother had been before she 
filled the placeholder of “mom” 
in my life 
 — which subsequent-

ly prompted the choice to reli-
giously listen to only “Hey You” 
for the next two months as a 
way to both try and understand 
the meaning of the song and 
also to try and understand my 
mother. That obsessive phase 
ended when the image of worms 
invading a man’s head outside 
a desolate brick wall started 
to make an appearance in my 
nightmares. I deemed my hell-
bent mission unsuccessful, and 
the inner workings of my moth-
er still remained shrouded in 
obscurity. But I never really let 
go of Pink Floyd completely. 

My mother remained an 

enigma to me. Growing up, she 
seemed constantly composed, 
untouched by her elusive past 
half a world away. I didn’t know 
many of her past experiences, 
and while she was never cold 
or aloof because of her poise, 
I still hungered relentlessly 
for more information; Sunday 
afternoons were filled with 
furtive glances into the pages 
of old black and white photo 
albums or sneaky escapades 
into the depths of my mother’s 
closet, fingers gliding over 
old fur coats and polka dot-
ted skirts, always wonder-
ing what stories of my mother 
these objects held. Because 
while my mother is the warm-
est and most welcoming per-
son I know, she is also selfless 
to a fault; selfless to the point 
of never talking about her past 
experiences because she never 
deemed them important enough 

to be brought to the forefront. 
She was always ready to bring in 
other family members, always 
ready to put other people before 
herself. That one afternoon in 
fourth grade was one of the first 
times I had seen her indisput-
ably put her interests and his-
tory in the spotlight, separate 
from anybody else.

I listened to “Hey You” again 

as a junior in high school, curi-
ous to see if the years that had 
passed would help me solve 
the riddle that was my mother. 
While she still remained largely 
unsolved, I did notice that my 
interpretation of the lyrics had 
shifted. When I was young-
er, I remained fixated on the 
descriptions of grotesque death, 
taking everything quite literally 
and morbidly. However, as time 
passed, I found myself looking 
past the surface level bleakness 
to the song’s underlining theme 
of perseverance and yearning 
for closeness that shone out 
like light escaping from cracks 
in a wall; a contradiction in all 
aspects, this song seems to gain 
strength from its own vulnera-
bility. I like to think my mother 
does the same. 

I recently called my mother, 

desperately looking, like most 
college kids, for yet another 
piece of advice on apartment 
living. Toward the end of our 
conversation she did not hesi-
tate to inform me that Roger 
Waters, an old member of Pink 
Floyd, is stopping in Michigan 
for his 2017 tour. My mother 
still hasn’t told me exactly why 
she has such a connection to 
Pink Floyd, or even why to “Hey 
You” in particular, but I’ve 
found that my need-to-know 
desire and wild daydreams 
have significantly diminished 
since the early days of fourth 
grade. I do not need the entire-
ty of my mother’s memoir laid 
out before me in order to under-
stand her. All I need is the 
excitement in her voice mak-
ing the phone line between us 
dance and leap as she tells me 
about tickets on sale. All I need 
is the fact that when I smile, 
despite the miles between us, I 
know she’s smiling too.

‘Hey You’ helped navigate the labyrinth of familial love

What Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall’ taught 
me about my mother’s inner life

 For a moment, Maggie 
Rogers seems to be singing 
just for herself. Meandering 
through a field of knee-high 
foliage, the singer is free of 
inhibition and preying eyes. 
She soon finds herself amidst 
a sparse clearing, sprinkled 
with slender trees and blan-
keted in freshly-cut grass. 
It’s there that her movements 
begin to mimic the music 
— they are jumpy, slippery 
and elegantly jagged. Rogers 
flicks and twirls her wrists, 
at the end of which are deli-
cately-pinched fingers. She is 
now walking and moving with 
purpose, juxtaposing the airy 
nature of her voice.
 But Roger’s isn’t left alone 
for long. Following her 

motions, three female back-
up dancers slide into view 
and join her in her jaunting 
strut. From there, the bodies 
and energy start to multiply. 
By the second chorus, the 
clearing has transformed 
into a multi-colored party 
scene, filled with smoke, 
smooching lovers and smil-
ing friends. This Technicolor 
scene continues for the rest 

of the video, giving audiences 
glimpses into the seemingly 
glamorous, young lives of 
those dancing along to Rog-
er’s melodic, sweet voice. The 
video ends just as it began 
— with Rogers sauntering 
alone through brushes and 
brambles — linking her and 
her music to all things free.

MAGGIE ROGERS

 Bruno Mars has sold 12 
million albums worldwide 
since 2010, won four Grammy 
Awards and headlined the 
Super Bowl. His clean-cut 
persona and starry-eyed sing-
a-longs won him hearts far 
and wide, old and young. Why 
would he switch up his style? 
Perhaps he was inspired by 
the immense success of last 
year’s collaboration with 
Mark Ronson — “Uptown 
Funk” — because on his new 
single, “24K Magic,” he’s 
seeking old-school coolness.
 The song shares its title 
with the Bruno Mars’ 
upcoming album and is an 

electric arrival at a groovy 
scene. Vibrant synths and 
thick bass strums strike 
like lightning as Mars 
struts across their boogie 
line with Prince-level 
swagger, boasting upon his 
arrival: “Pop pop, It’s show 
time!” The second verse is 
dedicated to “gangsters, 
hustlers, bad bitches and 
[their] ugly ass friends” in 
an ironically explicit turn 

for the usually-proper pop 
star, but his energy makes 
the lyrics’ intention clear: 
this is a booty-shaking 
anthem time warped from 
the 1980s. Bruno Mars is 
just playing the part, cuban 
links, designer minks and 
braggadocio included. The 
world should forever be 
grateful that he has decided 
to do so.

Kerrytown’s Vintage to 
Vogue offers boho style 

V2V is the kind of store you want your closet to look like

Walking 
into 
V2V’s 

Kerrytown 
location 
is 
like 

walking 
into 
a 
Bohemian 

dream. It’s the kind of store 
that you want your closet to 
look like, no matter what you 
normally wear. It’s cozy and 
impossibly cool, with exposed 

wood shelves boasting stacks of 
lacey bralettes and crisp denim 
jackets. The boutique is a staple 
of Ann Arbor shopping.

“It’s funny, a lot of people 

don’t even know, but V2V has 
been in Kerrytown for over 
30 years … It’s got a little bit 
of a historic mark,” said V2V’s 
Kerrytown location manager 
Julia Goulet.

Goulet grew up in Ann Arbor 

and returned to the city after 
graduating 
from 
Michigan 

State University in 2014. She 
took over the position as the 
manager 
of 
the 
Kerrytown 

boutique just over a year ago, 
though she was familiar with it 
long before then, and has been 
infusing the store with a young, 
vibrant energy ever since.

Suddenly I’ve aged 20 years and I’m now a soccer 
mom to two delinquents (Buzzed and Baked). 

But alas, the destination isn’t the field on 

which my future spawn will make a name for 

themselves, but rather the local cider mill 

that’s not quite that local when iPhone maps 
leads you astray (high key that even sounds 
like a WASPY mom 20 years my senior). I 
was hoping for an autumnal-themed day of 
fun, friends and refined carbs, and I guess 
that’s what I got, but alas, let me break 
it down. After a rousing drive with my 
two compadres, we exited my now reeking 
vehicle thanks to Mr. Baked. Buzzed needed 

some assistance descending from the height of 

my SUV, and as soon as she did she spotted a 

spotted dog (haha!). I’m unsure if Buzzed will 

remember that nearly her entire autumnal excursion 

was spent petting #SpottedDog and reminding Baked and 

I that ‘dog’ spelled backwards is ‘god’ so for all we know #SpottedDog is our creator. I then 
took a literal two minutes to peruse the apple selection and various #ArtisanalJams which I 
now know Buzzed found to be me ‘deluding myself’, and during this literal two minutes we lost 
Baked. Baked was later found face deep in a bag of donuts. Buzzed was #TooTurnt to join me 
in the donut line, so I never got my donuts. I didn’t even get cider. All I got was a glimpse of a 
soccer mom life I don’t want. What a time to be alive!

A trip to the 

cider mill

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind do the same activity 

and write about their experiences.

this week’s event:

You know the only better way to smoke other than hot-boxing your car? 

Hot-boxing someone else’s car while they drive you. (bonus points if 

it is to the cider mill). Idk what I’m more excited about, dough-

nuts (donuts????) or nature! Nature is just like meh sober 

but high its like ahhhhhh I am one with the earth. 

It’s stereotypical but u feel that shit when 

you’re high. Maybe I would like yard 

work more if I hot-boxed the 

garden shed before hand? 

*mental note to ask mom about 

this possibility* we can bond. DOG. 

not a drill. Its ears so so soft. This is the 

best day of the semester. (god backwards = 

dog fyi.) I’m V sad that we aren’t picking apples off 

trees instead they are in bins. This is bullshit. OK Caro-

line is taking way too long in this apple section I’m heading 

to the real attraction donuts.

-Daily Arts Writer

Don’t really remember the car ride here, its fine. BUT 

I DO remember going to the cider mill when I was a hot 
shit middle schooler and thinking it was cool AF to go 
somewhere so autumnal with all my besties. We looked 
so #fresh in our UGG boots. Nothing much has changed 
tbh. Idk how people like walk around these places looking 
at the produce and various products, they are deluding 
themselves — IT IS ALL ABOUT THE CIDER AND/OR 
DOUGHNUTS (donuts?) 

So obviously my fellow arts babies and I charge the cider 

line … I hope no one can see this flask in my pants…I’m 
just trying to make my cider a little more “fun” if you 
know what I mean. (I’m trying to be more drunk, in case 
you didn’t get it.) I even brought some festive fireball a la 
Pitbull’s suggestion to put some kick in mah drank. Also: 
dogs. Dogs everywhere. You know what makes anything 
better? Dogs. You know what makes dogs even better? 
Being drunk. Ily cider, ily dogs, ily daily.

STORE PROFILE

I’ve soured on the sports 

drama. Tired and clichéd, few 
of these films stray from the 
prototypical nar-
rative: an under-
privileged 
yet 

gifted 
athlete 

crosses 
paths 

with an excellent 
coach, who sacri-
fices work, family 
and the like for 
the pursuit of suc-
cess. The athlete 
struggles at first, 
but begins to ascend at a rapid 
pace, gaining confidence — to a 
fault, perhaps — until they lose 
a crucial match. Then, through 
a humbling and rededication to 
intense training, the prover-
bial trials and tribulation, the 
young prodigy outperforms the 
old master and emerges victori-
ous in a final competition. Cue 
credits. Oh, and for an extra 
little kick, add in a white savior 
narrative. Maybe you’ll end up 
with an Oscar for Best Original 
Screenplay.

“Queen of Katwe,” the latest 

film from trailblazing director 
Mira Nair (“Monsoon Wed-
ding”), strictly conforms to this 
narrative structure, but it man-
ages to add a bit of spin on the 
genre. First, the film is about 
chess, and despite the station-
ary nature of the game, “Katwe” 
moves rather quickly thanks to 
kinetic cinematography by the 
wonderful Sean Bobbitt (“12 
Years a Slave”) and quick edit-
ing by Barry Alexander Brown 
(“Do the Right Thing”). It’s 
incredibly lean. No second is 
wasted, and every scene offers 
critical information.

At times, the film’s score, 

composed 
by 
Alex 
Heffes 

(“The Last King of Scotland”) 
bristles with vivacity. That, 
combined with occasional slow 
motion flourishes, grants us the 
ability to experience what our 

protagonist, the gifted Phiona 
(newcomer Madina Nalwanga), 
must feel as she approaches 
each match.

Second, the film is set in the 

titular Katwe, one of the outer 
slums of Kampala, Uganda. 

Far 
from 
the 

typical American 
landscapes 
of 

other 
feel-good 

Disney 
films, 

Katwe 
is 
harsh 

but 
culturally 

rich. 
Ugandan 

pop music plays 
throughout 
the 

film and each shot 
is full of vibrant 

color. Nair, a Kampala resident, 
is uniquely able to bring the 
city’s communities to life. It’s a 
sort of reclamation of the Africa 
that has been defined by Western 
description: a land of destitution 
and disease. There’s plenty of 
that in Nair’s Uganda (the film 
takes place in a slum after all) 
but it’s not her focus. Rather, 
Nair turns to the socioeconomic 
dynamics in Kampala: the city 
skyline looms in the distance 
and casts a shadow over the 
slum. The young Katwe chess 
players, led by their coach, 
Robert Katende (David Oyelowo, 
“Selma”), are awestruck when 
they first encounter the wealthy 
secondary schools of the city.

“Katwe” also offers an unusual 

depth of character, though it is 
limited by the common tropes of 
the genre. Oyelowo gives as rich 
a performance as ever. Lupita 
Nyong’o (“12 Years a Slave”), 
who plays Phiona’s beleaguered 
and 
overwhelmed 
mother, 

confirms her status as one of 
our greatest living actors. And 
the Katwe children, entirely 
new actors plucked off the dirt 
streets of Katwe, bring a fresh 
vivacity unmatched by other 
films that used similar casting 
methods, like Laurent Cantet’s 
“The 
Class” 
and 
Naji 
Abu 

Nowar’s “Theeb.”

There isn’t anything terribly 

new to discover about the human 
spirit here — as always, we have 
to try hard to succeed and we 
shouldn’t give up — but the film 
tells these canonical lessons 
better than its predecessors. 
These lessons are as old as time, 
but Nair’s direction breathes 
new life into them.

Of 
course, 
“Katwe” 
fits 

cleanly 
within 
the 
Disney 

“feel-good” 
family 
sports 

drama genre, which is to say 
it comes with its fair share of 
flaws. The story’s structure is 
mostly unoriginal and its plot 
is predictable, though with 
a true story such as this one, 
there isn’t much to do to fix it 
without betraying the source 
material. Katende’s speeches 
and coaching are overwrought 
with 
chess-themed 
maxims 

that may make you roll your 
eyes more than a few times. 
There is also the occasional 
dramatic 
saturation: 
scenes 

that needlessly add to the 
weight of the film. A brief scene 
in which Katende tells a story 
of his mother comes to mind. 
Heffes’s score can also verge 
into John Williams-impression 
mode, with clear orchestral 
swells meant to signal a key 
emotional moment.

“Katwe” 
reminds 
me 
of 

another 
film, 
“Wordplay,” 

a 
documentary 
about 
a 

crossword puzzle competition. 
Both prove that the specific is 
universal. Both depict a niche 
activity, one that is hard to 
depict as entertaining. Yet both 
succeed in showcasing talent 
and ambition in all aspects of 
life. We need more adventurous 
films like these.

‘Queen of Katwe’ makes 
chess a compelling watch

FILM REVIEW

to,” Goulet said. “I shouldn’t 
have been shopping there.”

Goulet described her personal 

style as “boho with an edge. A 
little bit, like a very slight edge, 
like a dull butter knife.”

“I 
believe 
most 
often 

simplicity is key,” she said.

Throughout 
the 
store, 

simple and classic sweaters are 
paired with tassel necklaces, 
and bright floral dresses hang 
alongside structured fall coats. 
The boutique makes Goulet’s 
personal style accessible to 
a wide audience with brands 
like Free People, Ella Moss and 
Velvet. 

“You want pieces that are 

going to be a part of your 
capsule wardrobe and you can 
wear them multiple different 
ways as opposed to out one 

night,” Goulet said.

Aside 
from 
the 
standout 

classics, every season there 
are certain pieces that catch 
Goulet’s eye.

“One was actually in The 

Daily, in the photo shoot,” 
Goulet said. “The army green 
jacket with the beading on the 
arm — that was one that I was 
initially drawn to. It’s kind of 
nice to have something a little 
jazzed up.”

Other breakout styles have 

been 
leather 
skirts, 
floral 

dresses and even denim minis.

“If you asked me even a year 

and a half ago, the one trend I 
promised I would never buy 
into — and I totally did — was 
the mini jean skirt,” Goulet 
said. “Because it reminded me 
of when I was in seventh grade 

and had them from Hollister.”

Historically, the store has 

attracted an older clientele 
than other boutiques in Ann 
Arbor. Goulet said she has 
been “trying to appeal to a 
younger base … just trying to get 
ourselves known to the college-
age group.”

In recent months, there has 

been a shift in the demographic 
of customers at V2V as more 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students seek out the boutique 
for 
higher-end 
pieces 
and 

brands. Part of the attraction is 
the vibrancy and quirkiness of 
Kerrytown and the careful eye 
with which Goulet curates the 
store.

“We’ve got character, and 

that’s what I love about the 
store,” she said.

There isn’t 

anything new to 
discover about the 

human spirit.


W

hen I was younger, I 
detested vegetables. 
My mom, always the 

overbearingly health-conscious 
cook (though I love her for it), 
incorporated a serving into 
every meal. I would hungrily 
await dinner, then remember 
that eating dinner also meant 
having to eat vegetables, 
and apprehension replaced 
my hunger. Broccoli with 
the night’s dinner? Couldn’t 
stand to look at it. A salad for 
lunch? I would rather lose TV 
privileges.

Now, I can’t get enough of 

them. Literally. I can’t get 
enough vegetables. As a busy 
college student that makes it 
to the grocery store twice a 
month, it often gets difficult 
to stretch my produce supplies 
through 
the 
month. 
Most 

produce goes bad within the 
week — so buying them in large 
quantities isn’t always the best 
option. But, there’s a great big 
world of produce out there that 
holds various opportunities to 
incorporate more veggies into 
our sparse college diets. When 
stored and used properly, these 
veggies stand the test of time 
and bolster simple, nutritious 
meals.

Ever since moving out of the 

comfort and security of college 
dorm life, which inherently 
included a coveted meal plan, 
and into the scary threshold of 
off-campus home cooking, I’ve 
developed a means of optimally 
preserving and using up all of 
my favorite vegetables. I haven’t 
thrown out moldy tomatoes or 
found myself vegetable-less in 
over a year –– yes, that’s right. 
I didn’t have to buy less produce 
to do so. I simply developed 
a few habits and tricks that 
helped make the most out of all 
the 
glorious, 
nutrient-packed 

produce our (sometimes) friendly, 
local grocery stores have to offer. 
 
 

If you’re trying to pack your 

diet with more veggies and 
diminish the hassle of cooking 
week night meals or just trying 
to get your mom to stop nagging 
you about eating your vegetables, 
then read on. There’s a plethora of 
places where your vegetables can 
go rather than in the trash. Here 
are a few, just to name them:

The oven
If you have a lot of veggies (and 

not a lot of time), you can use 
my favorite method of cooking 
them, which is to roast ‘em. Just 
crank your oven to a toasty 400º. 
While it’s preheating, slice up 
your veggies (they don’t have 
to be perfectly sliced, just give 
them a few rough slices). I like to 
do this best with vegetables like 

bell peppers, onions, eggplant, 
zucchini, 
carrots, 
portobello 

mushrooms and sweet potatoes. 
Just toss them in some olive oil 
and salt and let them roast for 
about 25-30 minutes (the sweet 
potatoes and eggplant may take 
a little longer). Your veggies 
will get a nice burnt crisp on the 
edges, which brings out a ton of 
flavor.

This method is great if you’re 

short on time. You can eat them 
plain, straight out of the oven 
(which I often do, with some nice 
crusty bread and olive oil to dip 
in on the side). You can also toss 
them with some quinoa and fresh 
herbs for a salad or pile them up 
on bread with mozzarella for an 
easy sandwich. The options with 
these are pretty much endless 
and definitely delicious.

Note: 
if 
you’re 
roasting 

eggplant and zucchini, make 
sure to sprinkle them with salt 

after you slice them, let them sit 
for 10 minutes, then pat dry with 
paper towels to get out any excess 
moisture before roasting.

The freezer
This is probably the quickest 

and easiest way to preserve your 
vegetables when overcome with 
uncertainty as to how you’ll 
utilize them and subsequent 
anxiety about having to toss them 
out. I know, I know –– you can 
buy already frozen veggies at the 
grocery store, but I personally 
believe that buying them fresh 
and freezing them tastes better 
and is better for you. And you 
can freeze them in individual 
portions for quick use. I like to 
use this method with broccoli, 
cauliflower, greens and herbs. 
This way, I never run out of my 
beloved spinach or kale (which 
I sautée for almost every meal). 
For cauliflower and broccoli, it’s 
best to blanch them first (a.k.a. 
quickly boil them). Simply boil a 
pot of water, throw them in for 
2-3 minutes, then quickly remove 
them by dumping them into a 
strainer or colander and rinsing 
under ice cold water for a minute 
or so. Just note, any vegetables 
you plan on freezing will be best 
if used for cooking rather than 
eating raw (i.e. Do not try to make 
a salad with thawed spinach).

In a scramble, omlette or 

frittata

This one is pretty much a free 

for all. Eggs are an essential 
component 
of 
any 
college 

student’s diet and don’t believe 
anyone who tells you otherwise. 
You can put anything in a 
scramble and it’ll probably taste 
great. A few of my favorite veggies 
to throw in are mushrooms, 
kale, spinach, sweet potatoes, 
asparagus, tomatoes and redskin 
potatoes. If you’re making an 
egg dish, it’s best to cook the 
vegetables first (either in the pan 
or the oven). For the potatoes, you 
can cheat and microwave them 
on high, wrapped in a wet paper 
towel, for 5-7 minutes. Let them 
cool a little, then dice them up and 
fry them in the pan with some oil 
or butter for a few minutes before 
adding the rest of your veggies 
and eggs.

My favorite frittata recipe 

uses sweet potatoes (roasted in 
the oven, or boiled if you’re in a 
hurry), sautéed kale or spinach, 
caramelized onions and goat 
cheese. I whisk 4-5 eggs with salt 
and pepper to taste and about a 
¼ cup of milk or cream. Once 
my sliced onions are nice and 
browned (about 10 minutes) and 
the greens have wilted in the pan, 
I add in the sweet potatoes, eggs 
and cheese and stick it in an 425º 
oven for 20-25 minutes.

In a soup
There’s nothing like hearty 

soup to get you through those 
cold winter months in Ann Arbor. 
I lived off of mostly soup for the 
entirety of junior year because it’s 
so easy to make and store. Like in 
the latter method, you can do this 
with most vegetables — especially 
beans, 
tomatoes, 
zucchini, 

squash, potatoes, greens, etc.

My favorite recipe: Winter 

Tuscan kale and bean soup. This 
soup is great because it uses most-
ly pantry items that are cheap 
and easy to have on hand. Dice 
an onion, celery and some garlic 
and sautée in a large pot for a few 
minutes. Then add some chopped 
kale (stems removed), two 15 oz 
cans of cannellini beans, two 15 
oz cans (or one large 28 oz. can) 
of diced tomatoes with the juice 
(alternatively, you can dice up 
fresh vine or heirloom tomatoes if 
you have them on hand), a 32 oz 
box of chicken or vegetable stock 
and 1-2 additional cups of water. 
Bring it to a boil with salt and 
pepper to taste (or whatever other 
herbs you have on hand, such as 
dried parsley and oregano) and 
let simmer for 20-30 minutes (or 
until all the vegetables are ten-
der). This soup is great as a meal 
with macaroni noodles and par-
mesan cheese sprinkled on top.

To freeze, simply store the 

soup in a large Tupperware con-
tainer and let thaw overnight 
before reheating. Or, you can let 
the soup cool and ladle into Zip-
loc bags for individual servings 
(just make sure to lay them flat 
in the freezer).

Buddha bowls
You 
may 
be 
wondering, 

“What the heck is a Buddha 
bowl?” or, “But I don’t even go 
to yoga!” Fear not, you don’t 
have to contort your body 
to 
eat 
these 
delicious 
and 

filling bowls. Buddha bowls 
are simply what bowls filled 
with grains, veggies and other 
healthy toppings are referred 
to. They are a great way to use 
up veggies and pantry items. 
I typically make mine with 
quinoa (just cook according 
to the package instructions –– 
and you can substitute chicken 
broth for water if you have it). 
Then I roast some chickpeas 
(drain and pat dry a can of 
chickpeas, drizzle with olive 
oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder 
and paprika and bake at 400º 
for 30 minutes), sweet potatoes 
(same thing, except I only use 
salt and pepper to season), kale 
(toss in olive oil and lemon 
juice or sautée in a skillet for a 
few minutes until wilted), and 
whatever other veggies I have 
on hand (like carrots, avocado, 
or shredded cabbage). If you 
have a tub of hummus laying

EL CLUB

This looks like the opening shot of Boogie Nights.

The greater Detroit area is 

peppered with charming, rela-
tively small venues that host a 
plethora of local and upcom-
ing acts week after week. If 
you 
are 
relatively 
familiar 

with the indie music scene, you 
might recognize names like the 
Majestic Café, Marble Bar and 
UFO Factory (among others). 

Most recently, El Club has 

been added to the growing ros-
ter of hip concert spots, hosting 
shows by Car Seat Headrest, 
Porches and Titus Androni-
cus in its first six months of 
operation. Despite the unde-
niable coolness of the venue 
and of the many acts who have 
already graced its stage, there 
has been one markedly uncool 
aspect of every show I have 
attended at El Club: people just 
don’t seem to understand the 
certain unspoken rules to fol-
low when attending a show at a 
small venue.

At first glance, my com-

plaint — we’ll call it a griev-
ance — might sound like indie 
snobbery, but hear me out. 
Understand first that I do not 
seek to blame El Club for its 
misbehaved clientele; there’s 
nothing the venue can do about 
it. Eventually the hype will die 
down, and El Club will no lon-
ger be the extra-hip new spot.

But until then, as is com-

mon for newly opened bars 
that double as concert venues, 
locals will attend for “alcohol 
and live music!” rather than 
for, say, Joyce Manor or Twin 
Peaks specifically. This results 
in a crowd that is an interest-
ing mix of young professionals 
— for whom the show is a spec-
tacle — and fans of the specific 
artists, for whom the show is 
the only reason to attend.

At a large venue, it may be 

acceptable to shout and scream 
“we love you!” between (and 
during) every song, primarily 
because the performer prob-
ably can’t hear you, and the 
rest of the audience is being 
loud enough that you’re not 
distracting anyone.

In a smaller venue, this 

changes 
considerably; 
any-

thing said between songs at a 
volume normally reasonable 
for conversation can and will 
likely be heard by everyone in 
the venue, including the per-
former.

So 
when 
one 
individual 

decides to be particularly loud, 
that person, whether they real-
ize it or not — and often they 
don’t — is drawing attention 
away from the performance 
and directly to themselves. In 
the extreme, these individuals 
essentially become hecklers, 
and more than once I have seen 
performers at these small ven-
ues stop their shows to directly 
ask the person to stop or leave.

Therefore, I implore you: do 

not be the kind of individual 
who is so loud that you draw 
attention away from the actual 
show. By all means, cheer at the 
end of every song! Lose your 
voice in doing so! But don’t 
repeatedly shout the name of 
the song you most desire to 
hear them play, even if you 
just “need” to hear them play 
it. And no matter how “clever” 
or downright “hilarious” your 

borderline jeering may be, I’d 
put my life on it that the show 
as a whole will be at least mar-
ginally more enjoyable without 
your contribution.

These notes about etiquette 

should really go without say-
ing, and they may seem under-
whelmingly 
apparent. 
They 

are, but, for whatever reason, 
there remains a small portion 
of the population that remains 
oblivious, or just doesn’t care. 
Anyone who has been to any 
general admission concert has 
likely witnessed — if not dealt 
directly with — someone push-
ing straight through rows and 
rows of strangers to guaran-
tee themselves the best spot 
possible. In and of itself, this 
behavior is relatively harmless, 
but the ideology from which it 
proceeds is dangerous.

Maybe the person believes 

that they deserve a better spot 
because they’re a more ardent 
fan than everyone else in the 
audience — that’s why they 
showed up early to get a good 
spot, right? Or maybe they’ve 
adopted a contortedly capital-
ist approach in which he who 
shoves hardest deserves the 
best spot — politeness is weak-
ness, and non-confrontational 
tendencies simply a reflection 
that you aren’t a serious enough 
fan.

I have only the desire that 

you realize the following (or, 
even better, that the following 
is already painfully obvious): 
the show is not about you. It’s 
about the performer, who has 
spent innumerable hours pro-
ducing art for not only you, but 
everyone in the audience. If 
you truly have respect for the 
artist and their work, then you 
will also respect your fellow 
audience members. Your goal 
should be to ensure that every-
one has the best experience 
possible, not just you.

If you can’t make it to a gro-

cery store but are desperate to 
replenish your vegetable sup-
ply, here are some other great 
options:

Fruit fairies
For just $17, you can place a one-

time order for a basket of hand-
picked (by “fairies?”) vegetables 
that is delivered to your doorstep 
for free. A weekly subscription 
only costs $15, or alternatively, you 
can create your own custom bas-

ket from their selection of produce 
(individually priced).

You can find more information 

on their website here.

Replenish
Some 
of 
the 
produce 
at 

replenish is actually, shockingly, 
decently priced.

Though I usually resort to 

Replenish as my last option, a 
container of spinach or an onion 
will cost you the same (if not a 
few cents more) than at a grocery 
store.

Maize and Blue Cupboard
Pick up a free bag of produce 

from the Trotter Multicultural 
Center courtesy of Maize and Blue 
Cupboard, a nonprofit student 
organization that fights against 
food insecurity on campus by 
providing students with free 
access to grocery essentials. Food 
distributions are every month, 
so check their Facebook page for 
details on when distributions will 
be taking place.

Anyways, this has been my 

vegetable-mongering, “Eat more 
vegetables!” 
rant 
— 
because, 

though we hate to admit it, our 
mothers are usually almost always 
right.

At a large venue, it 
may be acceptable 

to shout and 

scream.

Now, I can’t get 
enough of them. 

Literally. I can’t get 

enough veggies.
