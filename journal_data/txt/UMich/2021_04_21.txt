The Michigan Daily sat down 

with University President Mark 
Schlissel to discuss fall plans, 
vaccination, carbon neutrality and 
disinvestment, Regent Ron Weiser 
(R), public records, ongoing collective 
bargaining with U-M lecturers and 
more. This interview has been edited 
and condensed for clarity.

MS: It is really important for as 

many students as possible to get 
vaccinated, and if they can’t get it 
done before they leave town, get it 
done over the summer. The supply 
of vaccines is getting better, the age 
limit has now gone down to 16 years 
old so all of our students can get 
vaccinated, and the greater fraction 
of people who are vaccinated, 
the more likely we are to have a 
semester in the fall that feels as 
close to normal as possible. 

TMD: Since we last spoke, the 

University announced its intention 
for mostly in-person classes and 
mostly full residence halls in the 
fall. Can you give us your best 
and worst case scenarios for what 
campus life at the University might 
look like in the fall?

MS: The best case scenario is that 

95 or 98% of students are vaccinated 
and an overwhelming majority of 
faculty and staff are vaccinated. 
And then what’s likely to happen, 
is we’ll begin the semester with 
the masks at least indoors, but 
with greatly relaxed restrictions 
around density. So student clubs 
will be able to meet in-person, we’ll 
have sporting events … a growing 
percentage of your classes will be 

in-person or more of their activities 
will be in-person. The campus 
will feel much more normal and, 
as the semester progresses, if our 
surveillance 
work 
on 
COVID 

indicates that things are safe, then 
we’ll start taking the mask off and 
getting back to our new normal. 
So that’s the optimistic view. 
Even though COVID is flaring all 
around the state, so is the rate of 
vaccination. The fall will feel like 
a transition, I think, between the 
really challenging year that we’ve 
had and then the calendar year 
‘22, which should be pretty much a 
normal winter semester next year 
by all projections. 

Worst case scenario, oh gosh. If 

I was being Dr. Doom and Gloom, 
I’d say that one of the variants 
of the virus that occurs learns 
how to escape the vaccines, the 
effectiveness of the vaccines may be 
lower in these mutant viruses and 
we may have to continue in a mode 
where we’re really, really careful to 
prevent the spread using all these 
other methods — distancing, density, 
masks and the like. That’s the worst 
case, but… I think it’s more probable 
that we’ll be closer to the best case.

TMD: Some colleges like Duke, 

Notre Dame and Rutgers have 
recently announced that they will 
require students to be vaccinated 
upon return to campus in the fall. 
How is the University evaluating 
whether the COVID-19 vaccine will 
be required for students and staff 
for the fall semester? When can the 
U-M community expect to know 
the University’s position? 

MS: We are actually discussing 

whether 
encouraging 
and 

incentivizing will work better 
than requiring or the other way 
around. Or maybe requiring in 
the dormitories and incentivizing 
elsewhere. We’re still far enough 

away that I don’t feel tremendous 
time pressure to make it mandatory 
today. Vaccines aren’t quite widely 
available enough today anyway, 
and you can’t just walk down the 
street, roll up your sleeve and get 
vaccinated. 

TMD: 
You’ve 
said 
the 

University’s public health experts 
have been instrumental in the state 
government’s pandemic response. 
Can you offer any insight into why 
state policy response to by far the 
most severe COVID-19 outbreak 
right now in the country has been 
limited to recommendations, when 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention Director Rochelle 
Walensky says Michigan needs to 
“really close things down?” 

MS: I’ve learned the hard way 

that it’s really difficult to second 
guess leaders with complicated 
jobs. So the governor has actually 
done quite well compared to many 
other governors. I don’t know the 
various pressures that she’s under. 
I can tell you that we’re still under 
a “work remotely if you can work 
remotely” rule. We’re still under a 
statewide masking mandate, and 
there’s still limits as to how many 
people can convene indoors and 
how many convene outdoors. I 
presume she’s striking a balance 
integrating all of the inputs that 
she’s getting from around our large 
and diverse state. So I won’t second 
guess her. I think it’s difficult for 
the director of the CDC to have 
that 
on-the-ground 
knowledge 

too, but I respect all their positions 
and the difficulty in making these 
decisions.

TMD: Is it possible that the 

current plans for commencement 
could change if circumstances 
change? 
For 
example, 
more 

in-person if vaccinations keep 
increasing, or less in-person if cases 

remain very high in the state?

MS: I think it’s very, very 

unlikely that it would become 
more in-person. I could almost say 
it won’t. The facts haven’t changed 
since we made the decision, and 
anything that’s changed has been 
the wrong direction. It’s really hard 
to predict what’s going to happen 
two weeks from now, but the levels 
that we have around the state now 
are way higher than I predicted 
they would be the last time we 
spoke (in early March). I think it’s 
extremely unlikely that it would be 
safe to do more than we’re already 
planning on doing. 

I’m reasonably optimistic that 

we can still have this viewing in the 
Big House for students that want 
to experience graduation together 
with their friends, and the reasons 
why are the ones that I’ve spoken 
about before — big venue, relatively 
small numbers of people. 

TMD: 
The 
President’s 

Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality released their final 
recommendations to you in March. 
How is the process going for you 
in terms of reading through the 
document and deciding what to 
implement, and how would you 
respond to student groups like the 
Climate Action Movement who 
questioned if the recommendations 
went far enough, fast enough?

MS: I think the commission did a 

great job. They satisfied the charge, 
they defined the scope of the issue, 
they defined a timeframe and they 
actually made 50 recommendations 
for how we can become carbon 
neutral. It’s very comprehensive. 
I’m really grateful. Another thing 
they did that I really appreciated is 
it was a very open and transparent 
process and involved lots of people. 

Nearly a year after the killing 

of George Floyd by a Minneapolis 
police officer, more than 100 
protestors united April 17 to honor 
Floyd’s death at Glencoe Crossing 
in Ann Arbor. The event, organized 
by Value Black Lives and Survivors 
Speak, drew families and locals to 
either listen or share stories about 
the impact of police brutality on their 
lives and injustice that continues to 
ensue upon people of color.

Floyd was killed in May 2020 

when Minneapolis police officer 
Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck 

for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while 
other officers were present. The 
murder sparked national outrage 
and initiated a racial reckoning over 
the summer when cities across the 
country protested against police 
brutality and called for racial justice 
and systemic change.

Following the death of Floyd, the 

Minneapolis 
Police 
Department 

fired Chauvin, and he was charged 
with second-degree murder, third-
degree murder and manslaughter. 
The trial of Chauvin began on 
March 8, and on April 20 he was 
found guilty on all counts.

Trische’ Duckworth, Survivors 

Speak founder and executive director, 
was one of the organizers of the 
protest. Since last May, Duckworth 

has been an active voice in the 
community, leading a plethora of 
other marches and rallies calling out 
police brutality and racial injustice. 
Duckworth opened the protest by 
also paying tribute to Daunte Wright, 
a 20-year-old Black man who was 
fatally shot by Minnesota police 
after being pulled over for expired 
registration and an air freshener 
dangling from his mirror.

“How many know we’re in a racial 

pandemic as well?” Duckworth 
told the crowd. “Not being here, not 
raising awareness, just wouldn’t 
be right because our Black blood is 
continuing to be spattered on the 
streets by police.”

Other local groups also joined 

community members on the march, 

including Boober Tours, Street 
Medicine, 
Southeast 
Michigan 

Street Medics, the Bike Alliance 
of Washtenaw County and Detroit 
Black Syndicate Motorcycle Chapter. 

“Understand 
this: 
We 
want 

reparations,” Duckworth said. “For 
everyone that thinks, ‘Well, I had 
nothing to do with that,’ it’s OK. You 
didn’t have anything to do with it, 
that’s fine, but I wasn’t a slave and 
I’m still fighting because we are in 
bondage.”

Protestors in attendance were 

instructed 
to 
practice 
social 

distancing and follow COVID-19 
precautions during the event. After 
introductions from Duckworth, the 
crowd marched to the Washtenaw 
County Sheriff’s Office, where 
multiple guest speakers shared their 
personal stories of police brutality 
with the crowd. 

Along the way, chants like “No 

Justice, No Peace!” and “Get back, get 
back, we want freedom, freedom!” 
rang throughout the streets. 

Protester Spidey Dee was one 

of the many members of the Black 
Syndicate 
Motorcycle 
Chapter 

who led the marchers on their 
motorcycles. When asked why he 
thought the rally was important, 
Dee told The Michigan Daily he felt 
frustrated by the repeated acts of 
police violence against Black people. 

“We’re standing up for justice 

for Black people and things going 
on in the world besides just this 
pandemic,” Dee said. “I’m here to 
stop the police from doing what 
they’re doing to our Black people in 
the youth and young people.”

One person shot at 
Briarwood Mall

Victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries

The Ann Arbor Police Department 

first received calls of multiple shots 
being fired inside the Von Maur 
store of Briarwood Mall around 3 
p.m April 16, according to Ann Arbor 
Chief of Police Michael Cox. 

No suspects are in custody and 

their whereabouts are unknown, Cox 
told reporters April 16 around 5 p.m. 

“This does not appear to be a 

random event, however, it is an active 
scene currently and we are still trying 
to clear some of the stores, ” Cox said.

Cox said there is one male victim 

with 
non-life-threatening 
injuries, 

who according to MLive was taken to 
Michigan Medicine in stable condition. 
When asked to confirm that a victim 
was transferred to the hospital, Beata 
Mostafavi, 
a 
spokesperson 
from 

Michigan Medicine, directed The 
Daily to AAPD.

According to Eastern Michigan 

University student Matthew Katz, 
who was inside the mall at the time 
of the shooting, he was told by a 
mall security officer to hide, which 
he did for about 25 minutes before 
leaving the mall. At April 16 5 p.m, 
police were still working on exiting 
customers from the mall store-by-
store. The mall remains closed, with 
state police guarding entry points 
with assault rifles. 

Those at the mall described 

confusion as the situation unfolded.

EMU sophomore Tyler Burkhardt 

was visiting a friend working at the 
Van’s store when they said they heard 

a noise that sounded like balloons 
popping. Burkhardt said they then 
saw numerous police officers rush 
into the building and tell them to 
evacuate the area. 

“My brain didn’t exactly register it 

at first and nobody around me really 
did until people were screaming 
and stuff, saying they needed 
help,” Burkhardt said. “Next thing 
I experienced were police pulling 
out rifles and stuff like that, the 
mall security pouring into the mall. 
Everybody just running, and then a 
security mall cop looked me in my 
eyes and told me to run, so I just ran.”

University of Michigan LSA 

junior Cassandra Menzies was at 
the Forever 21 store in the mall at 
the time of the shooting with four 
friends. Though she didn’t see or hear 
any shots fired, she said she began to 
wonder if something had happened 
when employees started closing the 
storefront — even though the store 
was not expected to close — and 
ushering them to the check-out area.

After being checked out, Menzies 

and her friends were brought outside 
through the back exit of the store, 
where they could then walk to their 
car and leave the mall. As they were 
waiting to leave, they began checking 
Reddit, but she said they could not 
find any information until she saw 
a post saying there was a shooting. 
Employees appeared to have as much 
information on the situation as they 
did, she said.

“I kind of wasn’t super comfortable 

leaving because we all thought it 
was an active shooter or something,” 
Menzies said. “I was more just nervous 
because nobody knew what was going 
on. I wasn’t totally afraid, but I think 
anxious is a good way to describe it.”

AAPD is asking anyone with 

additional information to call them at 
734-794-6920 or contact the tip line 
at 734-996-3199.

Hayner sanctioned 
for homophobic slur

Ward-1 Councilmember loses assignments

The Ann Arbor City Council 

met virtually April 19 to discuss a 
motion to remove Councilmember 
Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 1, from 
committee assignments, after he 
made a comment on a Facebook 
post that quoted a homophobic 
slur and demeaned journalists. 
The 
council 
also 
discussed 

affordable housing developments 
expected to progress in the near 
future.

The council passed DC-5, a 

resolution to remove Hayner from 
his current appointments. As part 
of the resolution, Hayner would 
be removed from the boards and 
commissions he has served on 
until December 2021, though he 
will remain as a voting member on 
City Council. The resolution also 
requests that Hayner participate 
in sensitivity training. 

After over an hour of discussion 

and multiple failed amendments, 
the 
resolution 
passed 
8-2. 

Councilmembers Ali Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5, and Kathy Griswold, 
D-Ward 2 voted no, and Hayner 
was recused from the vote.

During the discussion, Hayner 

repeated his apology, which he 
gave a day after defending his 
remarks in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily, for posting 
the slur and said he understands 
the harm the word caused to the 
LGBTQ+ community. However, 
Hayner 
also 
added 
that 
he 

believes being removed from his 
positions is “inappropriate” and 
overshadows the work he has 
done to support the LGBTQ+ 

community in the past, including 
marching with AIDS victims and 
supporting gay and transgender 
friends and family members. 

“I think (this resolution) is a 

dangerous thing,” Hayner said. 
“Words are dangerous, and the 
harm that they cause to the 
community is real, but I also feel 
that it’s an inappropriate solution. 
I don’t see how my quoting 
someone’s foul language that was 
repeated at infinitum on social 
media 
and 
councilmember’s 

websites makes me less able 
to steward our parks or read a 
liquor license report or read a 
Brownfield report.” 

Hayner 
emphasized 
the 

sincerity of his apology to the 
LGBTQ+ community, but added 
his comments did not break any 
City Council, state or federal laws. 

Councilmember 
Travis 

Radina, D-Ward 4, spoke on 
his personal experiences with 
homophobia and said he felt 
frustrated by Hayner’s lack of 
immediate acknowledgement of 
his wrongdoing. Radina posted 
the initial screenshot of Hayner’s 
comment as well as a copy of an 
email he sent to Hayner and other 
councilmembers 
condemning 

Hayner’s use of the slur and anti-
press sentiment.

Radina 
said 
he 
believes 

Hayner’s 
“eventual 
apology 

was sincere,” but that as a 
governing body, the council has a 
responsibility to the community 
to call out harmful language, 
and that includes voting on this 
resolution.

GOVERNMENT
How U-M exerts varying levels of influence 
on local, state and national politics

University spent $410,000 lobbying members of Congress in 2020

University of Michigan alum 

Ben Keller was a sophomore 
interning at the U-M office in 
Washington D.C. in the summer 
of 2016, responsible for lobbying 
members of Congress on policies 
largely 
pertaining 
to 
higher 

education. According to Keller, 
the experience taught him how 
much influence large research 
universities like the University 
hold in impacting policy. 

“I think Michigan has a ton 

of influence, unique influence, 
especially 
in 
the 
federal 

policymaking process because 
we’re such a large research 
institution,” 
Keller 
said. 

“We’re doing a lot of it, we’re so 
recognized for it. So we really 
hold a lot of sway.”

Keller noted that as a public 

institution, 
the 
University 

has to rely greatly on federal 
support, and as such must 
do everything in its power to 
ensure funding remains stable. 
For example, much research 
funding specifically comes in 
the form of the $514 million 
the University received in 2020 
from the National Institutes of 
Health. 

“We’re very dependent on 

those federal dollars to continue 
our research process going,” 
Keller said. “There’s every so 
often higher education bills that 
come through Congress and they 
have to get renewed. So we’re 
heavily involved in that and 
making sure that funding doesn’t 
get stripped away.”

As a result, the University 

spends large sums of money 
each year lobbying members 
of 
Congress 
in 
Washington, 

D.C., and — as a registered 
lobbying entity — must disclose 
all lobbying activities. In 2020, 
the University spent $410,000 
lobbying members of Congress.

According 
to 
Keller, 
this 

spending manifested itself in the 
activities he was taking part in as 
a member of the team at the D.C. 
office. Keller recalled examples of 
this spending, such as golf outings 
with members of other university 
government relations offices and 
participation in events held by 
members of Congress attended by 
lobbyists.

“Whenever 
a 
Congress 

member or constituent group was 
having any sort of event around 
research or change in federal 

research priorities or money, 
grants, anything like that, we 
would want to get involved in it,” 
Keller said.

Sarah Niemann, a Public Policy 

junior studying education policy, 
echoed Keller’s assessment of 
public universities’ need to lobby 
members of Congress to ensure 
funding remains consistent.

“The larger the university 

that you are, and the larger the 
endowment that you have, the 
larger role you are going to play 
in D.C. politics,” Niemann said. 
“Smaller universities might not 
have as large of a role and so large 
public universities like Michigan, 
as far as my knowledge goes, 
would have a larger influence.”

The University’s endowment, 

valued 
at 
approximately 
$12 

billion dollars, is the pool of 
assets given by the University 
donors. As of 2019, according to 
reports from the U.S. Department 
of Education, U-M had the 
ninth largest endowment in the 
country. 

Kristina Ko, the Director of 

the University’s D.C. office, said 
that recent lobbying efforts by 
the University have largely been 
based around the Pell Grant 
program. 

“This 
Congress, 
U-M 
is 

advocating 
for 
the 
higher 

education 
community-wide 

request to double the maximum 
Pell Grant award,” Ko said. 
“Currently, the maximum award 
is $6,495. Across all three U-M 
campuses, more than 11,600 
U-M students benefited from the 
Pell Grant in the previous school 
year. The Pell Grant is the federal 
government’s 
foundational 

investment in higher education. 
However, the share of college 
costs covered by a Pell Grant is at 
an all-time low.”

Some legislators have come to 

depend on funding from colleges 
and 
universities 
seeking 
to 

influence policy. In the case of 
U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., 
the University is his largest 
campaign donor and a source of 
frequent contact on policy and 
legislation. In a statement to 
The Daily, Peters referenced his 
office’s strong relationship with 
and support for the University.

“The University of Michigan 

is a world class institution and 
a major economic driver for our 
state,” Peters wrote. “I’m proud 
to work with them on issues 
that help keep Michigan at the 
forefront 
of 
innovation, 
like 

autonomous vehicle technology, 

expanding STEM and updating 
research and science law. Earlier 
this year, I worked to secure 
COVID relief funding for higher 
education 
institutions 
and 

students, and I’ll continue to be 
a partner to Michigan schools 
as they work to overcome the 
impacts of this pandemic.”

State officials have also said 

that recent policy, especially 
pertaining 
to 
the 
COVID-

19 pandemic, was influenced 
by the University — though 
not by university government 
relations staff, but rather by 
the University’s public health 
experts. 

According 
to 
Samantha 

Kennedy, 
the 
Deputy 
Press 

Secretary 
for 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer, the governor’s office 
collaborated with U-M public 
health experts on combating the 
spread of COVID-19. 

“The governor is grateful to 

be able to closely consult with 
nationally-recognized 
public 

health experts at the University 
of Michigan, as well as other state 
universities,” Kennedy said. “This 
pandemic has shown us that it is 
vital to collaborate with the best 
and brightest to ensure that the 
most up-to-date information and 
practices are at the forefront of 
the administration’s efforts to 
eliminate COVID-19 once and for 
all.”

U-M 
Vice 
President 
for 

Government Relations Chris Kolb 
also emphasized the frequent 
contact occurring between the 
University and state government.

“(The government relations 

office) 
tracks 
legislation 
of 

interest to all state universities 
and U-M specifically,” Kolb said. 
“In a legislative session, our 
office will track nearly 350 bill 
proposals and communicate to 
university stakeholders to solicit 
their views and input.”

On 
the 
local 
level, 
the 

University’s 
contribution 
to 

policy within the city of Ann 
Arbor is far different. In most 
regards, the relationship between 
the city and University could best 
be described as symbiotic, with 
minimal intervention of one 
entity on another. 

According 
to 
Ann 
Arbor 

Mayor Christopher Taylor, the 
University intervenes minimally 
in matters pertaining to the city 
of Ann Arbor, and vice versa. 

“The University is a great 

respecter of role,” Taylor said. 
“They don’t get involved in 
standard 
municipal 
matters, 

and they look for the same on 
the other side for us not to get 
involved in standard University 
matters. If the University has an 
interest in something the city 
is doing, adjacent properties, 
say or what have you, they’ll 
communicate it.”

One reason for this, according 

to Taylor, is that legally speaking, 
the University is a state entity on 
par with the Michigan legislature, 
due to its being established by the 
state constitution. 

“The University has land, 

money 
and 
constitutional 

superiority,” Taylor said. “The 
University is not obligated to 
follow our rules, and so our 
choice to zone this, that or the 
other thing this way or that 
way is not generally of driving 
importance 
to 
them. 
The 

University is a benevolent actor 
in the community, but they act 
on their own because they have 
the legal right to do it and the 
resources to do it.”

However, 
this 
practice 
of 

general 
non-intervention 
is 

often not the case with large 
universities. In 2017 for instance, 
Michigan State University — 
with much public criticism — 
offered the city of East Lansing 
$20 million to not institute 
a local income tax. Though 
public universities are property 
tax-exempt, 
an 
income 
tax 

would’ve required MSU to pay 
which would be taken out of the 
employee payroll. 

Taylor said he does not believe 

the University would have taken 
such actions to infringe on the 
jurisdiction of the city of Ann 
Arbor, even if it were to consider 
a similar policy. 

“Michigan State (University) 

had a lot of commentary about 
whether East Lansing would 
institute an income tax,” Taylor 
said. “That was something that 
they engaged substantially. In 
order to have an income tax 
in Michigan, a city has to put 
that matter up to the voters. So 
Michigan State University was 
involved in negotiations and 
letters back and forth with the 
city, but they had a position and 
they advocated for that. The 
University of Michigan would 
never do that.”

The 
division 
between 
the 

city of Ann Arbor and U-M also 
has limited the city’s ability 
to influence the University’s 
decisions. In Dec. 2020, after the 
University decided to only allow a 
small number of students to return 
to on-campus housing for the 
Winter 2021 semester, Ann Arbor 
officials urged administrators to 
provide emergency housing for 
the city’s homeless population. 
Despite Ann Arbor city council 
members pressing the University 
to agree to the partnership, no 
further action was taken by the 
University administration. 

Though the University may 

set a clear policy boundary 
between 
their 
institution 

and the city of Ann Arbor, 
they hold a significant role in 
lobbying at the federal level. 
According to Keller, however, 
this type of spending is par for 
the course in D.C. politics and 
manifests itself in the influence 
a university has.

“All this stuff just comes 

down to relationship building, 
and that’s what lobbying is,” 
Keller said. “If you’re trying to 
influence what’s going on, you’ve 
got to have a relationship with 
who’s making it happen.”

RESEARCH
LSA professor leads Virulent Hate Project
Dr. Melissa May Borja aims to track anti-Asian hate incidents, community resistance efforts

Dr. 
Melissa 
May 
Borja, 

University of Michigan assistant 
professor of American Culture, 
founded Virulent Hate, a project 
which aims to raise awareness 
around the surge in anti-Asian 
racism 
during 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic as well as document 
resistance 
to 
hate 
incidents. 

Founded in April 2020, the project 
tracks anti-Asian hate crimes 
reported in news media across the 
country and focuses on identifying 
trends. 

The project is a collaboration 

between 
student 
researchers 

across the country as well as 
the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting 
Center and is funded by U-M 
Poverty Solutions, which provides 
aid to research initiatives that 
aim to inform policymakers and 
community organizations. So far, 
the team has parsed through 4,600 
articles and found around 700 
overall instances of hate against 
Asian Americans. 

According to Borja, a general 

trend in anti-Asian hate incidents 
is that they disproportionately 
target women. In Virulent Hate’s 
own research from 2020, around 
61% of anti-Asian hate incidents 
were experienced by women. The 
shootings at Asian-owned spas 
in the Atlanta area last month 
sparked wider discussion about the 
impact of hate crimes against Asian 
Americans and the fetishization 
of Asian women, since six of the 
eight victims were women of Asian 
descent.

Borja said she was particularly 

surprised by the number of hate 
incidents occurring during the 
pandemic, even when lockdowns 
or other restrictions were in place.

“We saw a peak in incidents 

occurring in March and April of 
2020 and it was very shocking 
to us that these incidents were 
happening when most of us were 
trying to stay home and reduce 
how much we go outside,” Borja 
said.

Borja said a distinct part of the 

team’s research is looking at the 
different forms of hate experienced 
by Asians and Asian Americans, 
including various forms of non-
physical 
harassment 
and 
the 

impact of stigmatizing rhetoric 
used by politicians. 

“We are paying attention to 

forms of non-verbal harassment 
and 
verbal 
harassment, 
not 

just 
physical 
harassment 
and 

violence,” Borja said. “Research 
suggests, pretty compellingly, that 
it (stigmatizing rhetoric used by 
politicians) contributes to harm 
and racist backlash against Asian 
Americans.”

LSA freshman Krystal Huang, a 

student researcher on the project, 
said Virulent Hate’s goal is to 
publish information about Asian 
hate crimes around the country. 
This information is essential, 
Huang said, to informing people 
about the ongoing racism targeting 
Asian Americans.

Huang 
said 
when 
political 

leaders 
like 
former 
President 

Donald Trump use phrases like 
“China virus” and “kung flu”, this 
only fuels unfounded hate toward 
Asians.

“A lot of people don’t recognize 

the discrimination Asians face 
every day,” Huang said. “It is 
normalized through the model 
minority myth. We (at Virulent 
Hate) really are putting a spotlight 
on the rise in anti-Asian hate 
incidents.” 

U-M alum Jacob Gibson, a 

researcher on the project, said 
Virulent Hate initially aimed to 
document the rise in anti-Asian 
hate incidents due to the pandemic, 
but he said he now expects to see a 
continued rise in hate crimes even 
as people perceive the pandemic to 
be coming to an end.

Gibson said the project also 

tracks various forms of resistance 
to anti-Asian crimes across the 
nation, 
specifically 
the 
way 

activists and organizers respond 
to these incidents in their local 
communities. Gibson said this 
data is critical to informing local 
activism and raising awareness.

“We have the distinct goal 

of 
empowering 
community 

organizers,” Gibson said. “We 
want to use the information we 
have and share it as widely as we 
can so that organizers and activists 
can look at national trends and 
compare them with their local 
conditions.”

Gibson also said the project 

places a focus on the stories 
of victims and the impact of 
anti-Asian 
hate 
incidents 
on 

local communities rather than 
focusing on the perpetrators. By 
using resources available to the 
public, the project helps to tell 
these stories while respecting the 
privacy of victims.

“By using publicly available 

resources, we are not unearthing 
trauma that someone might wish 
to protect, but (the project) also 
offers a chance to center those 
stories,” Gibson said. “So often it’s 
the perpetrators that get the news 
headlines. By collecting the stories 
of individuals, there’s a chance to 
flip that narrative.”

Borja said she hopes Virulent 

Hate’s research findings are used 
to shape public policy, inform 
the 
activism 
of 
community 

organizations 
and 
improve 

people’s understandings of anti-
Asian hate incidents.

“Our hope is that we can take 

this information and share it with 
a scholarly audience through 
journal articles and reports, but we 
also think it is really important for 
the broader public to understand 
this research, too,” Borja said. 
“My hope is that by providing this 
information we can help educators, 
local activists and public officials 
understand the way anti-Asian 
racism is being expressed in their 
particular locale.”

Virulent 
Hate 
will 
be 

publishing a general report about 
the information gathered and an 
interactive map depicting anti-
Asian hate incidents across the 
country on May 1.

CAMPUS LIFE
You can have the best plans, 
but sometimes you have to 
change”: VP of Student Life 

reflects on past year

Martino Harmon talks fall semester plans, vaccinations

Before the Winter 2021 semester 

comes to an end, The Michigan 
Daily 
interviewed 
Martino 

Harmon, vice president of Student 
Life, about fall semester plans, 
housing, Fraternity & Sorority Life 
and vaccinations. This interview 
has been edited and condensed for 
clarity. 

TMD: Last semester, students 

were essentially kicked out of the 
dorms, and some scrambled to 
find off-campus housing. How 
will you ensure that students 
living in residence halls in 
the fall will have an improved 
experience? How will you ensure 
that 50% of the students living in 
the dorms will be vaccinated in 
the fall semester?

MH: We’re really optimistic 

about the future. Our plans for 
the fall — which are definitely 
rooted 
in 
encouraging 
a 

large number of students to be 
vaccinated — will give Housing 
the opportunity to have more 
safe 
face-to-face 
in-person 

interactions 
in 
addition 
to 

maximizing some of the virtual 
interactions that we’ve learned. 
For example, the lounges and 
the study spaces will be more 
accessible. They may be by 
reservation, but depending on the 
state of vaccinations, we may be 
able to have more flexibility. 

Also, providing vaccinations 

and testing for those that may 
not be vaccinated will help the 
Res Staff members feel safe and 
engage 
more 
with 
students. 

There will always be exceptions, 
but we’re strongly encouraging 
students to be vaccinated, and 
we’ll be talking about more 
and better ways to do that. 
The Campus Health Response 
Committee 
is 
working 
on 

systems that will allow students 
to report their vaccinations over 
the summer. The key is really 
encouraging 
students 
to 
get 

vaccinated as supplies continue 
to ramp up.

TMD: 
Will 
students 
on 

campus who are fully vaccinated 
have 
different 
guidelines 
to 

follow than students who are not 
fully vaccinated? 

MH: Some of those details 

are still unfolding based on 

(Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention) guidelines. So for 
example, we expect to have some 
safety measures in place, like 
masking and social distancing. 
We also don’t know if a booster 
vaccination will be needed at 
some point during the academic 
year, and that will impact some of 
the safety measures. There may be 
some safety measures that can be 
relaxed that will be determined 
by CDC and Washtenaw County 
public health guidelines.

TMD: The Daily has written 

multiple 
stories 
regarding 

students’ mental health during 
the pandemic, especially how 
virtual classes and COVID-19 
are affecting the campus climate. 
How do you plan to address this 
and 
improve 
the 
well-being 

of students now and moving 
forward? 

MH: 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological 
Services, 

Wolverine 
Wellness, 
Services 

for Students with Disabilities 
and (University Health Service) 
are working collaboratively to 
deliver a more holistic approach. 
I’ve worked with Provost (Susan) 
Collins, and we have appointed a 
review committee of people from 
academic affairs and Student 
Life to look at what we currently 
do and how we can improve or 
expand access. They have gone 
around 
various 
town 
halls, 

they’ve engaged with students, 
with staff and faculty and got 
a lot of feedback on a variety of 
different possibilities. They will 
present 
recommendations 
to 

the provost and I in May, and I 
think we’ll be able to implement 
some in the fall. The stress from 
virtual work is something we 
need to address as a root cause. 
To address the issue, we need 
to focus on more counseling 
and engaging with faculty and 
academic planners to see: “How 
can we be more aware and 
sensitive and plan to minimize 
some of those stresses?” If we 
only address the symptoms, we’re 
really not going to solve the issue.

TMD: Although student life 

was difficult due to the virtual 
format of this semester, how do 
you think that this year went, in 
terms of the student experience? 

MH: We surveyed students 

twice in the fall semester and 
had over 9,000 responses. It was 
clearly difficult for students to 
connect and find things to do, 
so I appointed a task force at 
Student Life to look at how to 

enhance 
student 
engagement. 

The task force really came up 
with a number of innovations 
like grouping weekly events and 
opportunities together in the Top 
Picks email sent every Sunday. 

We also expanded our cohort 

program to reach up to 2,000 
first and second-year students, 
providing a forum for students 
to make connections. We also 
launched 
a 
program 
called 

Resource Navigators where about 
140 volunteers from Student Life 
check in with over 2,000 first 
and second-year students who 
may not be connected to another 
established group. It was a tough 
year — a tough semester — and 
students really are exhausted 
from the whole experience. But 
our goal was to find ways to help 
students engage and connect and 
do all that we could do in a safe 
way to make the experience as 
good as it possibly could be given 
the context.

TMD: How much of student 

organizations and campus events 
do you anticipate will be virtual 
versus in-person come the fall?

MH: For Student Life, this 

will be the year of transition, 
meaning things won’t be 100% 
back to normal, but we’ll be 
moving towards that. We are 
planning and optimistic about 
more in-person events, and that 
includes student organizations. 
We want to give them guidance 
on how to have more in-person 
events. But, a lot of this revolves 
around 
students’ 
willingness 

and ability to be vaccinated. As 
vaccines are ramping up, we’ll 
have more options in terms of 
opening things up.

TMD: Fraternity and sorority 

life has a sizable presence on 
campus and in student life. What 
would you like to see change 
or continue about FSL here at 
Michigan?

MH: I’m really pleased that 

the councils’ leaders, which 
are 
the 
four 
major 
groups 

within Fraternity and Sorority 
Life, have stepped up during a 
difficult and challenging year 
and set some guidelines for their 
organizations. Self-policing and 
safety have been a real challenge 
for them during a time when 
everyone is exhausted and people 
naturally want to socialize, but 
those council leaders have done 
that.

 Daily Staff Reporters

The state of Michigan sent a 

concurrence letter April 12 to the 
Environmental Protection Agency, 
officially setting in motion the 
federal cleanup process for the 
decades-old 
1,4-dioxane 
plume 

contaminating 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

groundwater system.

“As 
requested 
by 
the 

communities, 
please 
reinitiate 

assessment of the site for the 
(National Priorities List) listing 
process,” 
the 
letter 
reads. 

“The Michigan Department of 
Environment, Great Lakes, and 
Energy (EGLE) will work closely 
with the USEPA and will also 
ensure that the current remedy 
continues to protect human health 
and remains in compliance with 
Michigan law during the NPL 
process.”

The plume, known as the 

Gelman plume, takes its moniker 
from the late Charles Gelman, a 
manufacturer 
of 
micro-porous 

filters in Ann Arbor in the 1950s. 
The chemical 1,4-dioxane — a 
likely carcinogen found to cause 
kidney and liver cancer as well as 

respiratory complications — was 
used in the manufacturing process 
and seeped into the ground beneath 
the company’s Scio Township 
plant. The contamination has since 
spread through the Ann Arbor area 
toward West Park and branches off 
of the Allen Creek drain system 
that discharges into the Huron 
River.

In December 2020, Ann Arbor, 

Washtenaw County, Scio Township 
and Ann Arbor Township all sent 
letters to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 
urging 
her 
to 
support 
EPA 

Superfund cleanup efforts. After 
four months, Whitmer approved 
EPA cleanup aid, prompting April 
12’s concurrence letter sent by the 
Department of Environment, Great 
Lakes, and Energy.

The concurrence letter comes 

one 
day 
before 
community 

members and local officials were 
planning to travel to Lansing to 
demand action from Whitmer on 
the steps of the Capitol. The rally 
has since been canceled.

The EPA has previously specified 

that its involvement in the Gelman 
site cleanup will only move forward 
if the state approves. Whitmer’s 
support will begin the process of 
placing the Gelman site on the 
National Priorities List, which will 
then allow the EPA to step in and 

begin the cleanup. To be eligible 
for the NPL, the EPA will continue 
local and state efforts to collect 
data and samples from the Gelman 
site before determining cleanup 
methods. The eligibility process 
would normally take two to three 
years, but local efforts to collect 
data and samples over years may 
shorten that time period, officials 
tell The Michigan Daily.

“Thank you Governor Whitmer 

for sending the letter to the EPA,” 
Ann Arbor City Councilmember 
Kathy Griswold, D-Ward 2, wrote 
in a tweet April 12. Griswold has 
been active in organizing efforts 
around a more comprehensive 
cleanup of the site. 

“I see that the EPA path is more 

strategic,” Griswold told The Daily. 
“It is going to take a few years 
before there’s actual cleanup under 
the EPA. But during that time, we’ll 
continue to clean up under consent 
judgment three, and then we may 
have a ruling from Judge Connors, 
that will require greater cleanup 
and that’s what I’m hoping for.”

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 

D-Mich., also released a statement 
April 12 in praise of the progress 
toward the Gelman plume being 
added to the National Priorities 
List. 

“For 
decades, 
the 
growing 

dioxane plume has been spreading 
through Ann Arbor’s groundwater, 
posing a concerning threat to our 
families 
and 
the 
surrounding 

environment,” Dingell’s statement 
reads. “Our communities have 
worked together to get us to 
this point, and I will continue 
to work with all federal, state, 
and local officials, as well as all 
stakeholders involved, to ensure 
this contamination is properly 
remediated and our public health is 
protected long-term.”

In 2016, the city of Ann Arbor 

filed a new lawsuit against Gelman 
and his company. A settlement 
was reached in September 2020, 
which detailed a thorough cleanup 
protocol, 
but 
residents 
were 

skeptical about the ability of local 
authorities to oversee and enforce 
this cleanup.

Dan Bicknell, an environmental 

remediation 
professional 
who 

discovered the Gelman plume 
while 
completing 
research 
at 

the University of Michigan in 
1984, called the idea that local 
government 
could 
compel 
a 

“resistant polluter” to conduct 
these cleanup efforts “not logical” 
in a September interview with The 
Daily.

While local officials continue to 

play out litigation in court — and 

are expected to present ideas for a 
new cleanup proposal in early May 
— the state is now also one step 
closer to receiving EPA Superfund 
cleanup.

Ann Arbor resident Beth Collins, 

secretary of Coalition for Action on 
Remediation of Dioxane, told The 
Daily in an interview that April 
12’s letter will be instrumental in 
bringing in the federal aid needed 
to strengthen cleanup efforts.

“I’m excited and all of us that 

have been wanting this (letter) 
for many years are hoping that 
this (letter) is the start of a 
new partnership between the 
state, federal and local units of 
government are all stakeholders,” 
Collins said.

Previous attempts to introduce 

EPA intervention began in 2017, 
when the EPA conducted a 
preliminary analysis of the Gelman 
site after increasing activism from 
local community members. The 
preliminary 
assessment 
found 

that the Gelman site qualified 
“for further investigation and 
evaluation in the NPL listing 
process 
— 
however, 
former 

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder did not 
support Superfund intervention.

“I have said before that the 

definition of insanity is doing the 
same thing over and over again, 

expecting 
a 
different 
result,” 

Collins said. “Every time (officials) 
want to go back to court — I mean 
nothing different has happened, 
and the plume keeps moving so 
you just want something different. 
I feel like a lot of people (may be) 
apprehensive of the EPA because it 
is different, but in my mind, that’s 
good. Difference is going to be good 
on this site.”

Jason 
Morgan, 
District 
8 

commissioner on the Washtenaw 
County Board of Commissioners, 
told The Daily the state’s letter is 
“monumental” given that it starts 
a bigger process with the federal 
government. Morgan also said 
the federal government will be 
able to finally hold the polluter 
accountable by requiring Gelman 
Sciences to pay for the adequate 
cleanup measures set by the EPA.

“That’s something we weighed 

quite a bit as we were thinking 
about our essentially two routes 
that we could go to pursue cleanup,” 
Morgan said. “The benefit to the 
federal approach is that they have 
more tools at their disposal. With 
the state process, we have a limited 
regulatory framework of state law 
to work with.”

I like the fact that it actually went 

beyond simply thinking about how 
to reduce the campus’ release of 
greenhouse gases. It talked about 
creating a culture of sustainability, 
promoting research and teaching 
around 
carbon 
neutrality 
and 

sustainability, and it had a very 
powerful focus on environmental 
justice. What I’ve been doing in the 
week since the report went final, and 
for the next several weeks, is working 
with various subgroups of executives 
and the folks actually responsible for 
the nuts-and-bolts of running our 
facilities and organizing the campus 
and trying to figure out what we 
can do. My aim is to talk about the 
game plan at the regents meeting in 
May. And by then the team will have 
digested and analyzed, and I’ll be 
able to talk about my initial response. 

I can easily see accepting a 

majority of the recommendations. 
There are some that we may need 
to do some more work or study, but 
overall I’m really pleased with the 
results and I’m very optimistic that 
we’ll be able to do a lot of this really 
starting now. In terms of various 
groups being happy or unhappy with 
the report, I think environmental 
sustainability, global climate change, 
greenhouse gases are amongst the 
most important targets of advocacy, 
all around the world, and certainly 
among student groups, and certainly 
here on campus. I predict the 
advocacy will continue, and there’s 
nothing wrong with that, it’s just part 
of how change happens.

TMD: The Board of Regents also 

recently voted in favor of disinvesting 
from fossil fuel companies and 
committing to a net-zero investment 
portfolio by 2050. In previous 
interviews, you’ve said changing 
investment policy is solely a financial 
decision. Regents Mark Bernstein 
(D) and Jordan Acker (D) thanked 
students and community members 
for their input when the new policy 
was approved. Was this disinvestment 
decision solely for financial reasons, 
or did activism and community input 

also influence the decision?

MS: For sure the activism focused 

our attention on this … and I give 
really a lot of credit to the folks who 
are the powerful advocates on this 
issue, it’s an important issue. You 
know my own positions evolved as I 
understand things better. 

The basis of the board moving 

forward is actually fiduciary. So 
what I mean by that is we came to 
understand that it’s inevitable that 
our society moves away from fossil 
fuels. We have to, and we think we 
have to do it quickly. It’s not going 
quickly enough, but the fact that we 
know that we’re going to end up not 
using oil and gas like we use it now 
means that investments in those 
assets are bad long-term investments 
— they’re going to go down in value. 
And we’re responsible not just 
for this year and next year for the 
endowment, but we’re responsible 
for your grandchildren if they 
get into Michigan, there’s still an 
endowment here to help subsidize 
their education. So companies that 
don’t come up with good plans to 
become carbon neutral, they’re going 
to become bad investments over 
time. Either the government’s going 
to start taxing carbon, or there’ll be 
other changes in society that make 
them bad investments. 

TMD: At the special Regents 

meeting April 2, several regents made 
statements 
condemning 
Regent 

Weiser’s 
recent 
remarks 
about 

women and allusions to assassination 
at the North Oakland Republic Club, 
with Regent Acker going so far as 
to call Regent Weiser’s comments 
“a betrayal” of the board’s work 
and “everything the University of 
Michigan stands for.” Regardless 
of the future of Regent Weiser’s 
relationship with the University, how 
do you and the board plan to rebuild 
the trust of the campus community 
as a collective decision-making body 
for the University and as an institution 
that purports to strive for DEI? 

MS: I hope that the board is able 

to rebuild some of the lost trust by 
focusing on our highest priorities and 
showing the public that this is what 
they work on. We work on access and 
affordability of a Michigan education, 

we work on academic excellence, we 
just spoke about work we’re doing in 
carbon neutrality and climate change, 
we work supporting our health system 
and life-saving research on many other 
topics. So I think the way to maintain 
trust and to grow trust is to focus on 
the things that are important to our 
community and do a really good job.

TMD: At this time, do you agree 

with the Board of Regents that 
Regent Weiser should resign? If he 
doesn’t — and he’s repeatedly said he 
won’t — how do you think the board 
will be able to work with him over 
the next four years? Regent Mike 
Behm (D) has said Weiser has been a 
“Regent in name only” since January. 

MS: So as I mentioned a moment 

ago, the board works by majority vote. 
On the vast majority of issues that the 
board addresses, there’s unanimity of 
opinion. We all share the same set of 
goals. I presume that the board will 
have to work its way past our entire 
community’s unhappiness with the 
events from a few weeks ago and 
figure out how to work together for 
the sake of the University. As I said, 
one regent has one vote and there 
are eight regents on the board. This 
process has served us well for 200 
years. Although I don’t know of 
another instance where there was 
a vote of the type that took place a 
couple weeks ago at a special meeting, 
there have been arguments amongst 
regents, disagreements of opinion. So 
it’ll be challenging, but I’m confident 
that the same mechanisms that have 
served the University for a couple 
hundred years will continue.

TMD: To ask you directly, do you 

agree with the Board of Regents’ vote 
that Regent Weiser should resign?

MS: I’m not a voting member of 

the board. I convene their meetings 
and I organize the discussions, but I 
don’t vote.

TMD: 
The 
Washington 

Post reported that you wrote to 
Wisconsin’s chancellor last summer: 
“If you simply delete emails after 
sending, does that relieve you of 
FOIA 
obligations?” 
When 
she 

responded that permanently deleting 
them violates state law, you said, 
“that’s really interesting and difficult. 
Thanks for explaining.” Do you ever 

permanently delete your emails? And 
if so, in what circumstances?

MS: Yeah, I say on a typical day, I 

get between 100 and several hundred 
emails. Every day. Maybe on Sundays 
a few less. So I’m always curating my 
emails, and I’m always discarding 
emails, and I think most people do. 
It’s to keep yourself organized, and 
not everything needs to be kept. 

The reason I was having that 

conversation 
with 
Chancellor 

(Rebecca) Blank is that Michigan 
Freedom of Information Act laws 
say nothing about an obligation to 
retain emails. So, in Wisconsin, their 
law requires they be retained. In 
Michigan, our law doesn’t speak to 
retaining emails. So I delete all kinds 
of emails every single day. I save 
some, I delete some — it just depends 
on what I’m working on.

I should point out … since this has 

received a lot of attention, we were 
conducting a discussion amongst a 
group of presidents, batting around 
ideas about how we were planning on 
approaching the fall semester. I love 
getting advice from other people that 
are separate from us but in analogous 
conversations. There was nothing 
mysterious in the emails and they 
eventually responded to a FOIA in 
Wisconsin, (and now) they’re all out 
there. There was nothing nefarious 
in these emails — it’s just a matter of 
people wanting to know what people 
are talking about.

TMD: In a broader sense, do 

concerns 
about 
public 
record 

requests ever discourage you from 
communicating candidly on official 
channels? 

MS: The most important thing to 

me is that I do my job 100% as best I 
can. And I communicate all different 
kinds of ways: sometimes by email, 
sometimes by telephone and now 
more and more this way, by Zoom. I 
do whatever suits the moment, and 
the idea is I’ve got to get the job done. 
I’ve got to talk to people, I’ve got to 
learn things, I have to compare notes. 
So we do what we’ve got to do.

TMD: The Lecturers’ Employee 

Organization gathered and marched 
outside of your house last Saturday in 
protest against the administration’s 
recent counterproposal in a closed 

bargaining session Friday, April 9. 
LEO has a history of voting to strike, 
and we’ve seen an even more recent 
strike from the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization at the beginning of the 
fall semester. With LEO’s contract 
set to expire in less than a week, what 
is the University prepared to do to 
prevent another strike from occurring? 

MS: We are strong believers in 

collective bargaining. We do our 
bargaining at the table. We don’t do it 
in the newspaper or something. 

But we’ve got multiple additional 

sessions scheduled with LEO. Our 
lecturers are very important to 
delivering our academic mission. 
They’re our colleagues. Many of 
them are neighbors or friends. And 
we’re committed to trying to find a 
mutually agreeable way to complete 
a contract negotiation. 

This happens every three years 

with every union — every two to three 
years, depending upon the union.

TMD: Part of LEO’s platform 

emphasizes pay parity across the 
University’s campuses, but Public 
Affairs recently countered that 
the University does not have an 
obligation to bargain with LEO on 
where funds unrelated to lecturers’ 
contracts go. Where do you stand 
on this question of LEO’s demands 
regarding the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses? Do you think the bigger 
question of equitable funding truly 
lies outside the purview of a labor 
union’s collective action efforts?

MS: As I mentioned earlier, I don’t 

negotiate in public or talk publicly 
about an active negotiation. 

I am comfortable saying that the 

three campuses of the University 
of Michigan are quite autonomous 
from one another. We share a 
Board of Regents and I supervise 
the chancellors on those campuses, 
but each campus gets a separate 
budget from the state — directly 
from the state, directly to that 
campus. Each campus makes its 
own decisions on admission (and) 
has its own standards. Each campus 
is accredited, independently of one 
another by a different accrediting 
agency. Each campus charges a 
different tuition. Flint and Dearborn 
are less (in tuition cost) than Ann 

Arbor. And the chancellors on each 
campus, or the president here in 
Ann Arbor, is responsible for making 
decisions and allocating resources 
on each campus. So, and that’s been 
the case since the 1960s, when Flint 
and Dearborn joined under the 
University of Michigan umbrella. 

TMD: Have you considered 

extending the Go Blue Guarantee to 
Flint and Dearborn? Do you have any 
concrete plans in that area?

MS: Yeah, I know that Flint and 

Dearborn themselves are considering 
whether they’d like to begin a guarantee 
because it’s the responsibility of the 
chancellor and the leadership on each 
of those campuses to decide how best 
to spend their resources. At Flint and 
Dearborn, almost 80% of the students 
or more get financial aid, more than in 
Ann Arbor.

If they decided to do a Go Blue 

Guarantee, they would take money 
away from somewhere else. So they’re 
making the balancing act or values 
judgment about what is best needed 
on each of the campuses. Here in Ann 
Arbor, the reason why we began a 
guarantee approach to this financial 
aid is we have a campus where very 
few people came from the bottom 
50% of the socioeconomic strata 
around our state. So we wanted to 
invest in making sure that Michigan 
in Ann Arbor was accessible to people 
throughout the economic spectrum. 

TMD: What’s your favorite song 

from the rerecorded Taylor Swift 
album “Fearless” released Friday?

MS: Usually I try my very best to 

answer all your questions. I had no 
idea that Taylor Swift just rereleased 
an album, and although I’m sure I’d 
recognize Taylor Swift if I heard her 
on the radio, I’m not sure I can name 
any of her songs. I’m embarrassed. You 
know, my musical experiences stopped 
in the 1970s. If you want to talk a little 
Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney or 
something, I’m with you.

Since April 1, several streets in 

Ann Arbor have been closed to 
make room for additional outdoor 
dining for local restaurants. The 
closure, which is similar in style to 
last summer’s street closures, will 
include the following streets: 

Street closures lasting from 4 
p.m. on Thursday to 6 a.m. on 
Monday will be enacted on: 

• Main Street from William 

Street to Washington Street

• East Liberty Street from Ashley 

Street to Fourth Avenue 

• Liberty Street from Maynard 

Street to State Street,

• State Street from William 

Street to Washington Street 

Street closures lasting seven 
days a week will occur on: 

• Washington Street from Ashley 

Street to Main Street

• East side of Maynard Street 

from Liberty Street to William 
Street

Maura 
Thompson, 
interim 

director 
of 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

Downtown Development Agency, 
said the change was made as part 
of the city’s COVID-19 response 
to improve social distancing in 
restaurants. Thompson also said 
the decision came after businesses 
reported widespread success in 
expanding outdoor dining and 
social distancing out onto the street 
this past summer. 

“For many businesses, the three 

(street) closures were really helpful 
in generating enough revenue to 
survive,” Thompson said. “(The 
closures) were just really imperative 
to business operations throughout 
the summer.” 

Councilmember Ali Ramlawi, 

D-Ward 5, who also runs the 
downtown restaurant Jerusalem 
Garden, said the City Council’s 
decision 
to 
close 
the 
streets 

again this spring came from 
overwhelming community support 
and 
increasing 
evidence 
that 

outdoor dining was safer than 
indoor dining. 

“I believe the survey that the 

Main 
Street 
Association 
put 

out (showed) over 95% of the 
respondents had favorable opinions 
about it and wanted to see it come 
back,” Ramlawi said. “And this 
allows for greater social distancing. 
It’s 
scientifically 
proven 
that 

eating outdoors is safer than eating 
indoors.” 

Jeff More, the owner of Ashley’s 

on State Street, said even before the 
pandemic he had been advocating 
for the City to allow Ashley’s to 
install a seven-day-a-week parking 
lane to use for outdoor dining and 
more tables. Moore said being able 
to implement this change as well 
as the City allowing him to set up 
a 20-by-50-foot outdoor dining 
area has been incredibly beneficial 
in Ashley’s getting through the 
pandemic. 

“I don’t know many (restaurants) 

that really made money last year 
… so, there is a need to try to get 
back on solid footing,” More said. 
“I think the outdoor seating in that 
expanded space will help get back 
to that vibrancy of downtown Ann 
Arbor.” 

Engineering sophomore Sydney 

Anderson said though she had 
noticed an uptick in traffic since 
the streets closed on April 1, she 
thought the closures would force 
people to get out and walk more 
which would help local businesses 
and the environment. 

“I think it’s healthier for the 

person … It’s way better for the 
community and the businesses 
because if you’re walking, you’re 
more likely to step into a store, rather 
than if you’re driving by,” Anderson 
said. “Pedestrians already run Ann 
Arbor, let’s be honest.” 

Ann Arbor native Ann O’Brien 

moved back to Ann Arbor from 
New York this summer and said she 
thought the street closures were 
one of the best decisions the city had 
made in a long time. O’Brien said 
the closures created an increased 
sense of festival and community 
downtown.

“Summertime is a good time to 

get out, walk around town, be on 
your bike, be a pedestrian,” O’Brien 
said. “It may cause extra traffic 
backups, a few days a week, but 

I don’t think it’s going … to have 
much of an impact because it’s 
more happening on the weekends.” 
 

Ann Arbor City Council has 

previously 
discussed 
making 

the 
weekend 
street 
closures 

something Ann Arbor does every 
summer. Ramlawi said these 
conversations began even prior to 
COVID-19, but the pandemic has 
accelerated them. 

“There’s 
been 
talks 
before 

COVID about having pedestrian 
streets in areas of the town close 
to vehicular traffic,” Ramlawi said. 
“In a post-pandemic (world), we 
have a very beautiful downtown 
that people are envious of … and I 
think we should celebrate that.” 

Ramlawi said there were many 

factors, such as the opinions of Ann 
Arbor residents and the closure’s 
effect on retail commerce, that City 
Council would need to consider 
before 
making 
a 
permanent 

change. 

O’Brien said she hopes the 

closures become permanent as she 
believes the lack of cars in the area 
makes downtown a more desirable 
place for Ann Arbor residents to 
spend their time. 

“It just promotes more of a 

healthy atmosphere; people are 
more inclined to walk, sit outside, 
perhaps not bring their cars into 
that area,” O’Brien said.

Justin 
Zhao, 
co-owner 
of 

Sharetea on State Street, said he 
had some reservations about the 
street closures continuing in a 
post-COVID-19 world. Zhao said 
Sharetea is planning on using 
the space for increased outdoor 
dining for their store, but he said he 
worries once students come back 
full-time, there will be increased 
traffic and congestion in other 
parts of the city. 

“I feel like other areas would 

be very congested around (State 
Street),” Zhao said. “When the 
students are here … those streets 
are pretty important (and) they 
need to be opened up for cars.”

Street closures are currently 

slated to last until late August.

ADMINISTRATION
Dr. Robert Sellers to 
step down in December

U-M Chief Diversity Officer was at helm of five-year DEI strategic plan

Dr. 
Robert 
Sellers, 
the 

University of Michigan’s chief 
diversity officer, announced he 
will be stepping down from his 
position Dec. 31, according to The 
University Record. Sellers was at 
the helm of the University’s five-
year strategic plan for diversity, 
equity and inclusion, referred to 
as DEI 1.0, which will come to a 
close this year.

“As DEI 1.0 draws to a close 

after an initial five years and 
we move seamlessly toward 
DEI 2.0, Dr. Sellers believes this 
is the right time to allow new 
leadership to bring new ideas 
and new energy to the work 
that is absolutely essential to 
our success as an institution of 
higher 
education,” 
University 

President Mark Schlissel wrote 
in a message to the University 
community. 
“Yet, 
we 
would 

not be in a position to move 
forward on our goals without 
his leadership and the work he 
has done in this role over the last 
seven years.”

As the University begins its 

search for his successor among 

current faculty members, Sellers 
will remain in his position until 
the end of the calendar year. In 
his 
announcement, 
Schlissel 

affirmed the University “will not 
let up” on DEI 1.0 in this period of 
transition.

Sellers has served as chief 

diversity officer at the University 
since 2014. In an email to 
his 
colleagues 
prior 
to 
the 

announcement, Sellers expressed 
gratitude 
to 
the 
campus 

community members he has 
worked with and their “amazing 
commitment 
to 
making 
the 

university a better place for all.”

“While there is still work to do, 

I am very proud of all that we have 
accomplished,” Sellers wrote.

Schlissel 
provided 
well 

wishes to Sellers in his email to 
community members and outlined 
how important Sellers has been in 
the University’s commitment to 
DEI during his tenure.

“While it truly takes each 

one of us to raise up the work of 
diversity, equity and inclusion at 
a place as big and dispersed as the 
University of Michigan, Dr. Robert 
Sellers has been outstanding in 
leading this critical work across 
our campus on a day-to-day basis 
for the past seven years, alongside 
his tremendous team,” Schlissel 

wrote.

Sellers plans to return to 

his post in the Department of 
Psychology as a tenured faculty 
member. In addition to being 
chief diversity officer, he has 
worked within the University 
for 28 years. Once the University 
finds his successor, Sellers said in 
his message he will work closely 
with administration to help with 
the transition process.

As Sellers steps down, Schlissel 

reaffirmed his own commitment 
to DEI in his email to community 
members.

“We 
cannot 
be 
excellent 

without being diverse in the 
broadest sense of the word,” 
Schlissel wrote. “And we must 
also ensure that our community 
allows all individuals an equal 
opportunity to thrive.”

As chief diversity officer and a 

member of the provost’s cabinet, 
Sellers 
coordinated 
efforts 

such as faculty recruitment and 
retention, tenure and faculty 
development. The position also 
involved advising Schlissel on 
DEI-related issues and serving as 
University spokesperson for DEI 
matters.

ANN ARBOR

Initiative rebooted after help restaurants, seeing success last summer

 SCHLISSEL
From Page 1


Reporting live from my balcony, 

yet again, for another literary event 
coverage. This time it’s chef and author 
Bill Buford’s appearance in the “At 
Home with Literati” series, presenting 
his latest book “Dirt: Adventures in 
Lyon as a Chef in Training, Father, and 
Sleuth Looking for the Secret of French 
Cooking.” Today I’m not drinking 
Roiboos tea but matcha! This was my 
first time trying it, and it will most 
probably be the last. Apologies for any 
grass-tasting milk lovers, but I will 
stick to my former choice of drink.

Before tuning in on this April 5 

evening to Literati’s Zoom webinar, I 
did a fair bit of research on the author in 
question. Before I realized it, I had spent 
almost an hour watching his cooking 
videos on The New Yorker’s YouTube 
channel, such as this one, where he 
cooks a delicious apple pie with the help 

of his twin sons in his home kitchen.

The event began with a brief 

introduction by John Ganiard, the 
event director for Literati, who gave 
the audience a bit of background into 
how Buford’s “Dirt” came to be and 
the unanticipated abandonment of 
the chef’s life in New York City for 
a five-year adventure in Lyon, “the 
gastronomical capital of the world.” 
Then it was Buford’s turn to elaborate 
on the marvel of that voyage, and how 
a filthy bakery run by a man named 
Bob, as well as his apprenticeship in a 
storied Michelin-starred restaurant, 
broadened his culinary skills (and his 
archive of great anecdotes). 

Buford’s book, which serves as a 

sequel to “Heat” (2006), a memoir of 
how he left his position as editor of 
The New Yorker to dive into Italian 
restaurant kitchens, was described 
by Ganiard as more “conversational 
storytelling” than the actual heavy 
reflection normally associated with 
memoirs. Buford read the opening 

pages, and I could instantly tell what 
he had meant by that — it was written 
in a humorous conversational manner. 
I felt like I was at a dinner table and he 
was telling me an anecdote about his 
life — a vivid narrative situated in the 
heat and stress of a Michelin-starred 
kitchen, with smells and sounds 
accompanying his interactive way of 
depicting the scene. 

The anecdote was about artichokes 

— and I love artichokes — so I instantly 
drew my ear closer: Buford had 
botched the preparation of the green 
buds so badly that he had the whole 
staff in the kitchen buckle in laughter. 
All but the head chef, who was serious 
in the way French chefs are: “Arms 
crossed and frowning, because nobody 
smiles in kitchens.”

Buford explained his experience 

in two very different workspaces, a 
Michelin-starred restaurant and an 
eccentric bakery, both of which taught 
him a great deal about French cuisine 
and the important role it plays in the 

country’s culture. He emphasized 
his admiration for the farm-to-table 
custom that has proliferated in France 
and the emphasis on fresh, local and 
unprocessed food. The title of the book 
stems from this notion that it is the 
soil in which the food is growing — 
ingredients that haven’t been ruined by 
modern life — that makes it so special. 
Buford puts it beautifully: the marvel 
of the hundreds of different kinds of 
cheeses and the “poetry in every kind 
being tied to a place and not another.”

The webinar turned into a Q&A 

and I posed two questions, although 
I could have asked him many more. I 
wanted to know what dish, out of the 
ones he had learned in Lyon, had been 
his favorite. “Chicken,” he laughed. He 
also mentioned mastering (and loving) 
making sauces.

My second question, and the one 

which concluded the event, posed 
whether he ever thought of opening up 
his own restaurant and where he would 
locate it. Buford said he had a fantasy of 

going back to France and then opening 
up a restaurant with fellow chef Michel 
Richard upon his return to New York. 
Or maybe a pop-up restaurant in Lyon. 

A potential location he mentioned 

was Piedmont, the region bordering 
France and Italy, as a place where 
he could put his “love for the way 
in which the French and Italians 
conversed” into work — a place where 
his genius and his apprenticeship 
could come together. Additionally, he 
did say he loved Spanish cuisine as 
another potential future project — a 

completion of his Mediterranean trio. 
As a Spaniard, I would love to see that.

My stomach rumbles at the thought 

of Bob’s bread, of my grandma’s 
artichokes (which I like to believe are 
well-cooked) and of Buford’s pastas. 
Now I log off for the day, happy to have 
hopped, once again, into an Ann Arbor-
run literary event and extending the 
list of book recommendations that I 
will read when I have more time in 
my hands. Hopefully alongside some 
delicious apple pie and Rooibos tea (not 
matcha).

My least favorite subgenre of film and 

television doesn’t have a name, and I don’t 
think I would be able to give it one if I had 
to. I have to use a lot of words to describe 
it, something like “movies or shows with 
famous white people in prosthetics playing 
Republicans.” 

The films “Vice” and “Bombshell,” along 

with the Showtime miniseries “The Loudest 
Voice,” all came out within one year. They 
epitomize this strange genre phenomenon 
through their depictions of former Vice 
President Dick Cheney, various former 
Fox News anchors including Megyn Kelly 
and former head of Fox News Roger Ailes 
respectively. 

The three projects were released as if 

they were on a schedule, with almost exactly 
six months between each of them. It’s like 
Hollywood had a Republican biopic quota 
and was trying to fill it as quickly as possible.

It was quite the trend. I remember looking 

up at a massive billboard for “The Loudest 
Voice” in the summer of 2019 and thinking, 
“this is that Dick Cheney movie’s fault.” When 
I watched the first trailer for “Bombshell” 
later that year, I thought, “this is that Roger 
Ailes show’s fault.” It’s not that movies about 
Republicans hadn’t been made before (Oliver 
Stone’s “Nixon” and “W.” come to mind), but it 
was the first time that I’d seen them churned 
out so quickly.

The entertainment industry is liberal: 

Everyone knows that. When a movie or 
TV show is about American politics, the 

protagonists are usually Democrats, but no 
one really makes a big deal about their party 
affiliation. In “The West Wing,” President Jed 
Bartlet (Martin Sheen, “Judas and the Black 
Messiah”) and his successor are Democrats. In 
“The Ides of March,” George Clooney’s (“The 
Midnight Sky”) character is a Democratic 
nominee for president. Even in “Definitely, 
Maybe,” a romantic comedy, Ryan Reynolds’s 
(“Deadpool”) character is an enthusiastic 
volunteer for Bill Clinton’s presidential 
campaign.

Democratic politics are so casual in 

Hollywood that whenever someone makes 
a movie about Republicans, it really has to 
be about Republicans. There has to be a 
spectacle — i.e. putting actors like Christian 
Bale, Charlize Theron and Russell Crowe 
into heavy prosthetics to make them look like 
carbon copies of the people they’re portraying. 

It has to be something gimmicky that will 
win awards and underscore the inherent 
“otherness” of movies about conservatives, 
which stand out in an industry that so 
obviously leans left. And Hollywood usually 
takes the bait — Bale won a Golden Globe for 
“Vice,” and “Bombshell” won an Oscar for 
makeup and hairstyling.

It’s almost like movies about Republicans 

and conservative media are thought of as 
boundary-pushing. As far as turning politics 
into entertainment goes, I can understand 
why the Republican Party and the vast 
media empire that props it up might be more 
fun to write about than their Democratic 
counterparts. I’m pretty confident that no 
one is writing spec scripts about the lives of 
Al Gore, Rachel Maddow or whoever the 
head of MSNBC is. Republicans are just more 

entertaining, even if it’s not for good reasons.

But there’s something so insidious about 

making Republican politics seem subversive 
through film and TV. It’s not that “Vice,” 
“Bombshell” or “The Loudest Voice” are even 
particularly generous to their subjects — “Vice” 
blows up Cheney’s villainy into Shakespearean 
proportions at the end — but none of these 
attempted revelations actually reveal anything. 
Cheney’s warmongering and Ailes’s sexual 
misconduct are well-documented, and Kelly’s 
move from Fox News to NBC after Fox News’s 
#MeToo moment created a massive media 
stir. The people who care to see these stories 
fictionalized are most likely people who are 
already somewhat informed on the stories’ 
realities, not people who might be coming in as 
a blank slate.

So what is the value of retelling these 

stories on screen? Is there any at all?

The conservatives who might watch 

these movies will find that they’re perfect 
fodder for their perceived victimhood, 
something to point to and whine that 
they’re being oppressed by the liberal media. 
But they’re also great for feeding liberal 
superiority complexes, which thrive off all 
of the finger-wagging the movies do. They 
also allow a self-satisfied Adam McKay 
(“The Big Short”), the director of “Vice,” 
to comment directly on exactly how edgy 
and groundbreaking he thinks his movie is 
through an unnecessary, meta, mid-credit 
scene in which a focus group argues over the 
film’s political biases.

The real purposes, then, of productions 

like “Vice,” “Bombshell” and “The Loudest 
Voice” are first to employ every white 
actor in Hollywood, and second to indulge 
their creators and the misguided creative 
instincts that tell them what they’re making 
is somehow valuable to political discourse. 
In practice, they just end up either preaching 
to the choir or to a congregation with pre-
drawn conclusions, both of which render the 
sermon needless and empty.

As far as I know, nothing else has come out 

that fits the very specific criteria of famous 
white people, prosthetics and Republicans, 
so I’m hopeful that Hollywood has learned 
something from the fact that both “Vice” 
and “Bombshell” underperformed at the box 
office, if nothing else. I’m crossing my fingers 
that they represent a bygone era, because if I 
ever see a billboard advertising a biopic about 
Mitch McConnell, I might try to rip it down 
myself.

Lil 
Nas 
X’s 
latest 
single, 

“MONTERO (Call Me By Your 
Name),” is much more than a hollow 
pop song from an internet personality 
— it’s a statement. As the most 
musically and thematically complex 
song from the artist, whose given 
name is Montero Hill, “MONTERO” 
is a triumph in self-expression. The 
luscious production and danceable, 
Latin-inspired groove compliment 
Lil Nas X’s vocal performance, which 
ranges from lustful to pleading. Lil Nas 
X clearly sings from the heart as he 
meditates on codependency, sexuality 
and secrecy within relationships. 

The song has gained attention since 

it was released on March 26 in part due 
to its colorful, campy and controversial 
music video laden with riffs on biblical 
and literary allusions normally used to 
villainize queerness. Lil Nas X plays 
every single character in the video, and 
at one point, literally (lap) dances with 
the devil. 

In three tightly packed minutes, 

Lil Nas X plays a long-haired Adam 
in the garden of Eden. There, he is 
confronted by a snake, who seduces 
him with a third eye. After, a pink-
haired Adam is taken to a trial where 

he’s stoned to death (alluding to Plato’s 
“Symposium”). Lil Nas X then pole-
dances down to the deepest layer of 
hell, where he enters the devil’s palace, 
gives him a lap dance, snaps his neck, 
takes his horns and assumes his place 
on the dark throne.

In a Twitter statement, Hill opened 

up about the inspiration for the song 
and video: mainly, his feelings of 
religious self-loathing while in the 
closet. He publicly discussed the 
bigotry he’s experienced, especially 
from the religious right, which has told 
him he’ll burn in hell for his sexuality. 
In the music video, Lil Nas X bravely 
decides to silence his inner devil and 
embrace his sexual orientation; if he 
must go to hell, so be it. 

Alongside the song, Lil Nas X 

partnered with art collective MSCHF 
to create a limited number of “Satan 
Shoes.” These shoes, which were 
modified Nike Air Max 97’s, featured 
a bronze pentagram, were inscribed 
with “Luke 10:18” (which states, “I 
watched Satan fall from heaven like 
lightning”), and contained a drop of 
human blood. Nike, who played no part 
in manufacturing these shoes, filed a 
restraining order against MSCHF in 
response to widespread confusion over 
their role in the stunt. 

The video and the accompanying 

shoes sent shockwaves through the 
internet. Many internet conservatives 

took to Twitter to voice their concerns 
over the shoes and the video’s 
homoerotic 
and 
satanic 
content. 

Kaitlin Bennett — better known as 
the “Kent State gun girl” who became 
famous in 2018 for bringing an AR-10 to 
her graduation photoshoot — was very 
vocal about her outrage over the music 
video. A heated Twitter exchange 
broke out between Bennet and Hill 
which ended in Bennet’s bigoted 
tweet: “Do you still see your dad?” Lil 
Nas X responded: “yep and i might fuck 
yours.” 

Other right-wing commentators 

like Candace Owens, Gov. Kristi 
Loem, R-S.D., and Pastor Mark 
Burns were very outspoken with 
their condemnation of “MONTERO.” 
Celebrities 
like 
basketball 
player 

Nick Young and quarterback Trevor 
Lawrence publicly criticized the 
“Satan Shoes,” with Young stating, 
“My kids will never play Old Town 
road again.” Singer Joyner Lucas took 
issue with the influence Lil Nas X has 
on little kids, to which he responded, 
“i literally sing about lean & adultery 
in old town road. u decided to let your 
child listen. blame yourself.” 

The belief that Lil Nas X lost his 

kid-friendly appeal by embracing 
his sexuality has parallels to the 
public backlash over Miley Cyrus’s 
“Wrecking Ball.” However, while 
Cyrus took a full beating of hate in 

2013, Lil Nas X has been clapping back 
with just as much shade as what’s been 
thrown at him. Even before “Old Town 
Road,” Lil Nas X has been an expert 
at playing the internet game — his 
internet persona is just as important as 
the music he has released. The success 
of his songs can partly be attributed 
to their virality on TikTok, where his 
extremely online presence allows him 
to engage with millions of fans. 

On TikTok, where Lil Nas X began 

his career, he reposts hilarious fan 
“MONTERO”-themed 
TikToks 

multiple times a day. He contributed to 
this content by starting a TikTok trend 
where people pretend to be stuck at 
the gates of heaven or hell, as Lil Nas X 
quickly slides past on his pole, causing 
them to confusedly hear a fraction of a 
second of “MONTERO.” Additionally, 
Lil Nas X used TikTok to promote 
his free browser game called “Twerk 
Hero,” which challenges the player to 
twerk along with the avatar on-screen. 
It’s clear that Lil Nas X understands 
how to game social media with a fresh 
sense of humor; his TikToks receive 
hundreds of thousands of likes and are 
often reposted to other social media 
platforms. Many people may not be 
familiar with “MONTERO” by name, 
but have tangential knowledge of the 
song from the explosion of memes, 
tweets and TikToks strewn about the 
internet.

This isn’t a happy coincidence — 

“MONTERO’s” publicity explosion 
on the internet is by design. It’s how 
“Old Town Road” went viral, and 
how so many people are familiar 
with “MONTERO.” In contrast to the 
genuine, raw nature of the song, Lil 
Nas X uses cheeky social media humor 
to publicize his work. In addition to his 
many social media exchanges, Lil Nas 
X posted a video titled “MONTERO 
but ur in the bathroom of hell while lil 
nas is giving Satan a lap dance in the 
other room,” following the popular 
YouTube meme format.

In the comments, many noted they 

were surprised to see that Lil Nas 
X himself posted the video — many 
stated that much of the content that Lil 
Nas X posts aren’t reminiscent of an 
advertising campaign, but instead, that 
of a viral meme page. With his excellent 
marketing skills, Lil Nas X might be 
one of the few artists who understand 
the psychology behind Gen Z internet 
usage: make people laugh, and you 
have their attention. 

For Lil Nas X, who has yet to release 

a full album, the divisive release of 
“MONTERO” at this point in his 
career is a testament to his bravery. 
It’s worth noting that the backlash 
he has faced is disproportional to that 
of other artists who’ve used satanic 
imagery, like Madonna, AC/DC or 
literally any rock band. As a Black, gay 

man who tells his story honestly, Lil 
Nas X is targeted by right-wing media 
for not staying within the “acceptable” 
boxes created by the music industry 
and beyond.

A certified bop like “Old Town 

Road” appeals to everyone — many 
of Lil Nas X’s original fans come 
from across the world and political 
spectrum, even many who harbor 
hateful views towards the queer 
community. Lil Nas X is aware, yet 
doesn’t shy away from unapologetically 
celebrating his identity.

He uses his wide platform for good 

by normalizing content that empowers 
queer people of color in a world that 
seems to despise both groups. Lil Nas 
X knew he would make a polarizing 
statement, but to him, it was worth 
others feeling less of the self-loathing 
he did growing up. Statements like the 
video of “MONTERO” spur important 
discussions about the acceptance of 
queerness. Through “MONTERO,” 
Lil Nas X displays boundary-breaking, 
society-shaping artistry in its truest 
form. 

Make no mistake: Lil Nas X isn’t a 

passive product of internet algorithms 
— he’s a social media master. With 
“MONTERO,” Lil Nas X uses his 
platform, artistic talent and playful 
nature to celebrate queerness with a 
video that’s sure to go down in internet 
history.

As a little kid, Jimmy Neutron was always 

one of my favorite characters, thanks to the 2001 
cinematic experience “Jimmy Neutron: Boy 
Genius.” At the age of four, I even recommended 
that my parents name my little brother, Sacha, 
“Jimmy.”

Yes, the television show, “The Adventures of 

Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius” was great, and I 
remember enjoying the reruns, but it finished 
airing when I wasn’t even old enough to read. 
Thus, episodes of the show were not easily 
accessible. On the other hand, the movie was 
readily available via DVD anytime I wanted it.

The film follows Jimmy Neutron, a brilliant 

inventor, and his elementary school friends, as 
they attempt to rescue their abducted parents 
from a planet of gooey aliens. The parent-
napping was made possible by Jimmy himself, 
as he sent the coordinates of Earth into space in 
hopes of making contact with friendly aliens. 
Before the kids find out why their parents 
are missing, they partake in a heinous darty 
and wake up with massive kid hangovers, 
which include tummy aches, boo-boos and a 
desperate need for lunch. They subsequently 
realize the value of quality parenting and, led 
by Jimmy, orchestrate a plan to fly to space to 
save their folks from the throes of the gooey 
aliens and their chicken monster-god, who has 
an appetite for humans. 

Before re-watching the movie, the moments 

that had stuck in my mind were the silliest 
ones, such as Jimmy’s friend Sheen peeing in 
the shower (and proclaiming it to no one in 
particular), and Jimmy’s accidental shrinking 
of the shrill teacher Mrs. Fowl. However, upon 
rewatching, I realized that the movie offers 
several valuable and wise lessons for kids that 
are still exceedingly relevant for children today. 

In the animated TV realm of the 2000s, 

most protagonists were extraordinary because 
of some sort of supernatural power. Whether 
it be Timmy Turner with his fairy godparents, 
Danny Phantom with his ghost powers or Aang 
with his bending powers, all of these characters 
benefit from otherworldly abilities. Conversely, 
“Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius” introduced a 
hero whose only superpower is his intellect 
and ambition. Many of Jimmy’s inventions fail, 
such as his bubble transportation device and 
jetpack. However, he never gives up and keeps 
working on new devices and strategies until his 

goal of saving his parents is complete. Jimmy’s 
work ethic and self-made nature is inspiring 
for kids who are used to seeing characters with 
unreal powers.

And during times of adversity, Jimmy 

demonstrates the value of perseverance and 
searching for a solution instead of sulking. In his 
lowest moments of the movie, Jimmy has the 
two most groundbreaking realizations of the 
film (the first being that all the kids’ parents have 
been abducted, the second being a strategy to 
escape an alien dungeon). This may be an overly 
simplistic way of looking at the world, but it is 
a usefully optimistic portrayal of struggle and 
redemption for kids, who will undoubtedly face 
misfortune at certain points in the future.

Jimmy also exemplifies the adage “with 

great power, comes great responsibility.” He is 
a genius, but he does not let his greatness get to 
his head. He remains humble and treats his less 
intelligent friends, Carl and Sheen, with respect. 
Through his creation of silly inventions, such as 
burping soda, Jimmy maintains that he is not 
above his friends or audience.

Several lessons from “Jimmy Neutron: Boy 

Genius” feel ahead of their time. For example, 
the importance of privacy and not sharing 
personal information is made clear through 
Jimmy’s blunder of sending his coordinates 
to space. This lesson is pertinent to kids today, 
many of whom have smartphones and are on 
social media by the age of 11. 

Similarly, the issue of actively seeking out 

popularity, or clout chasing, has worsened with 
this increase in social media use by kids. One of 
Jimmy’s classmates, Cindy, originally falls into 
this trap by obsessing over the class’s cool guy, 
Nick, even though she and Jimmy share more 
in common, such as an adoration of space. By the 
end of the movie, Cindy becomes disinterested 
in Nick, and a future relationship with Jimmy 
is alluded to, which emphasizes the importance 
of finding a relationship based on the right fit as 
opposed to popularity.

It may seem like this analysis is too in-depth 

for a kid’s movie. However, while I may not 
have been able to point out all of these hidden 
values at the age of four, it does not mean that 
I was not subconsciously absorbing them. 
You don’t always need to be aware of why 
you are drawn to great art. This is the beauty 
of good child entertainment in particular. 
Like “Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,” it should 
impact its audience in ways they cannot even 
fully comprehend at the time of first viewing 
it.

When you think of the word indie, 

what typically comes to mind? Is it 
a youthful aesthetic? Is it a culture 
defined by being ahead of the curve? Or 
is it maybe just a new sound? Whatever 
the interpretation is, it’s hard to argue 
that Animal Collective doesn’t embody 
it in some way.

Yes, I know. An artist retrospective 

on Animal Collective? How original. 
However, when people talk about the 
band’s absurd run of albums in the 
2000s, they tend to leave out some 
crucial records in their early years as 
well as smaller side projects. Hopefully, 
this will help shine some light on some 
of the more under-appreciated records. 
Regardless, the level of impact the band 
has had on both its contemporaries 
within the indie genre, as well as what 
the genre would become because of 
their influence, is undeniable.

By looking back through their 

discography, we can see the way 
Animal 
Collective 
constantly 

evolved their sound and forged an 
uncomparable identity not only within 
their niche, but the musical landscape 
as a whole. Of course, this article won’t 
be covering every project from the 
group, but it will cover most of it. Let’s 
begin.

Spirit 
They’re 
Gone, 
Spirit 

They’ve Vanished — Everything 
Animal Collective can be traced 
back to Baltimore, Md., where all 
four members — Dave Portner (Avey 
Tare), Noah Lennox (Panda Bear), 
Brian Weitz (Geologist) and Josh 
Dibb (Deakin) — grew up and met as 
teenagers. Once off at college, they 
would congregate every summer 
to make music. Around this time, 
Portner was already in the middle 
of writing a record. He then asked 
Lennox to participate in the recording 
process. Thus, Spirit They’re Gone, 
Spirit They’ve Vanished was released 
in August 2000.

In every regard, this album is a 

miracle. Nothing at the time sounded 
remotely like it, and to this day, few 

records can compare. Portner and 
Lennox tap into a side of the juvenile 
experience that rarely gets explored. 
The instrumentation can turn from 
sporadic folky acoustics to harsh 
unabashed noise in an instant. At the 
same time, they managed to craft long 
complex songs that demonstrate an 
affinity for experimental compositions 
far beyond their years. Tracks like 
“Penny Dreadfuls” and “Alvin Row” 
are perfect examples of this ability.

What really sets this record apart 

from anything else at the time is that 
it never once feels like it’s trying to 
be experimental. It’s just the music 
Portner and Lennox wanted to make. I 
would be remiss if I didn’t mention the 
track “Untitled,” which might be one 
of the most powerful songs Animal 
Collective has ever made. It could just 
have easily been titled “Staring Into 
the Face of God.” If you ever need to 
prove to someone that noise can be 
beautiful, this is all you need.

Danse Manatee — At this point, 

the band was hitting a creative 
flow. They began discovering the 
experimental branch of music and 
fell in love. Around this time, they 
met with and became friends with 
experimental noise group Black 
Dice (a band that probably deserves 
a retrospective in their own right). 
While having included harsh textures 
to some degree on their prior project, 
this introduction opened their eyes to 
not only the limitless possibilities of 
noise but the different types of noise 
that can be implemented. With these 
interests in mind, Portner and Lennox 
brought along Weitz to work on their 
next album, Danse Manatee, released 
in July 2001.

This album often gets overlooked 

in comparison to the enormity of the 
band’s full catalog, mostly because it 
is seen as more of a transitional work 
for them. In some ways, this is true. 
The trio definitely experimented more 
on this project. There are very few 
tracks, if any, that contain any sort of 
familiar song structure, or a structure 
at all for that matter. And yet, it never 
feels as though the album loses focus 
or purpose.

Everything flows in a very organic 

way, despite the sound being more 
synthetic than anything they had 
done up to that point. However, the 
most impressive part is how the band 
utilizes noise. Spirit They’re Gone is 
loud, but Danse Manatee is noisier. The 
band uses quiet, high-pitch frequency 
as a background for the music they put 
in front of it. This creates the sensation 
of something itching at the back of 
your brain. It’s infectious in that way.

Campfire Songs — Not long after 

Danse Manatee was released, the band 
started working on material again. 
They had been enticed for years by 
the idea of creating something warm 
and inviting. Naturally, this pushed 
them toward an acoustic sound, and 
their next release Campfire Songs 
certainly embraces it. With five tracks, 
two over ten minutes long, Campfire 
Songs captures Animal Collective 
at their most hypnotic and ambient. 
The band piles several layers of guitar 
chords strumming on top of each 
other to create a full psychotomimetic 
soundscape, a technique they would 
use many times in the future.

This is one of those LPs where the 

music and the title work in harmony. 
Campfire 
Songs 
feels 
like 
the 

apotheosis of all late summer evenings 
around a fire with friends. There is a 
comfortable atmosphere established by 
the repetitiveness of the strumming but 
also a sense of adventure in the way the 
music glides smoothly along. Each song 
transitions perfectly so that the tracks 
are seamless and indistinguishable 
without checking to see if the title 
has changed. The album is one whole 
experience that really doesn’t get 
enough praise. It should be noted that — 
although they weren’t improvised — all 
five tracks were recorded in one take on 
a porch. How aesthetically perfect.

Ark — Technically, this is the 

first official Animal Collective LP. 
Everything before was retroactively 
included by both the fans and the 
band themselves. Originally titled 
Here Comes The Indian, the project 
released in 2003 was later renamed 
Ark due to the disrespectful nature of 
the initial name.

In many ways, this project feels like 

the evolved form of Danse Manatee. It 
contains many of the same experiments 
with noise; this time, everything is 
mixed so that this experimentation is 
front and center. The band comes closer 
to traditional song structure than ever 
before (which isn’t saying much). They 
play with a tight intensity that feels in 
your face but they do not lose complete 
sight of the psychedelic and hypnotic 
atmospheres they worked with on 
Campfire Songs.

The track “Infant Dressing Table” 

is a delicate sound representation of 
infancy that builds slowly until all the 
different textures coalesce into one 
sound. It balances chaos and beauty 
in a way that should not work as well 
as it does. Ark as a whole feels like 
a summation of what the band has 
worked on before, but with slightly 
more refinement.

Sung Tongs — For fans, Animal 

Collective has a golden era in their 
career, and most would agree that 
this is where it begins. After the 
dense collages of Ark, the band felt it 
necessary to strip things back. And 
if they’ve learned anything, it’s hard 
to get much more stripped back than 
acoustic. Thus, Sung Tongs was born. 
But to expect this to be similar to 

Campfire Songs would be a mistake. 
They tighten up their focus even 
more, emphasizing as much organic 
instrumentation as possible. The result 
ends up sounding halfway between 
alien folk songs and indie Captain 
Beefheart. Percussion becomes an 
important element of the record as 
a way to accentuate the complex 
rhythms introduced throughout.

The percussive feel of the LP even 

finds its way into the guitar-playing, 
with sharp strumming carving 
out rhythms of their own. It’s the 
perfect music to try and fail to dance 
to. Somehow, they manage to sound 
even more playful than usual while 
also achieving some of their most 
meditative works to date.

This is the album where Animal 

Collective 
establishes 
that 
they 

are 
very 
much 
accomplished 

songwriters. Each track has more of a 
thematic presence. “Kids on Holiday” 
depicts the conflict of trying to make 
the most of constant travel despite 
its depressing monotony. “Visiting 
Friends,” perhaps the track most 
similar to Campfire Songs, presents 
a wordless long-form expression of 
the beauty of being with new friends 
as well as the anxiety of hanging out 
with people you still don’t know too 

well. “College” is less than a minute 
long and consists of Lennox and 
Portner layering vocal harmonies on 
top of each other in a way that sounds 
similar to what Robin Pecknold 
would do years later. The song has 
only one line: “You don’t have to go 
to college.” Sung Tongs truly is a 
triumphant moment for the band as 
well as an indicator to everyone of 
how unrestricted their creativity was 
then.

Prospect Hummer — After Sung 

Tongs, Animal Collective had the 
attention of nearly every music critic 
under the sun. While they were 
touring in the United Kingdom, they 
happened to meet legendary folk artist 
Vashti Bunyan. This meeting seemed 
to have been fruitful because the band 
immediately started reworking some 
unreleased cuts off Sung Tongs for 
Bunyan to sing on. The final product 
would be the Prospect Hummer EP, 
released in early 2005.

Thinking about the sound Bunyan 

was known for and the sound Animal 
Collective was working with at the 
time, it is absurd how well this EP 
turned out. .

Film director Spike Lee and jazz 

trumpeter Terence Blanchard have 
been working together for 30 years. 
Lee makes the films; Blanchard 
makes the music. “We’ve developed 
a shorthand,” Lee explained in a 
virtual panel discussion last week. 
“A mental telepathy terminology.” It 
seems the two have nailed down a 
process of collaboration, one that some 
in the film industry might consider 
unconventional.

Typically, a composer writes the 

score after the film is shot and edited. 
Lee and Blanchard operate differently. 
“Terence gets the script at the same 
time as the actors get the script,” Lee 
said. He added, “It’s a great disrespect to 
the composer to be the last one hired.”

Using this system, Blanchard 

has composed the score for many of 
Lee’s joints — “Malcom X” (1992), 
“Black KkKlansman” (2018) and 
most recently “Da 5 Bloods” (2020), 
which earned Blanchard an Oscar 
nomination for Best Original Score.

In Lee’s films, composition happens 

as the movie is being made, without 
Blanchard on set. This is where 
the telepathy kicks in. Throughout 
the production process, Lee sends 
Blanchard the script, stills and clips 
of the film in progress. This keeps 
Blanchard in the loop — he’s gotten 
into the habit of making the stills the 
screensaver to his computer so that 
the film is a part of his daily life. This 
way, by the time the film is complete, 
Blanchard is already engrossed in it; he 
can already see it, feel it, even smell it.

On Wednesday, both Lee and 

Blanchard virtually addressed the 
University of Michigan as part of the 
centennial celebration of the School 
of Social Work. In a panel discussion, 
Lee and Blanchard were joined by 
Daphne Watkins and Robin Means 
Coleman. Dr. Watkins is a professor at 
the University’s Social of Social Work 
and Dr. Coleman is film producer and 
professor of communications (among 
other titles) at Northwestern University. 
 

Due to some unfortunate and 

unexplained technical difficulties, the 
program began 30 minutes behind 
schedule. While approximately 1,400 
viewers were waiting at the scheduled 
start time, only 700 stuck it out for the 
show and just 471 lasted to the end. 
This didn’t stop the duo from bringing 
playful energy; later on, during some 

brief audio issues with a student 
question, Lee cracked, “You gotta get 
someone from Ohio State to do the —,” 
intentionally pausing to make a joking 
commentary on the audio situation. 
The panel roared.

Lee spoke to his virtual audience 

live from the headquarters of his film 
company, Forty Acres and a Mule 
Filmworks, in Brooklyn, N.Y. He sat 
in a fabulous high-backed chair I 
would’ve described as maroon and 
silky, but that he made sure to classify 
as “purple crushed velvet.” His voice 
sounded echoey, like he was speaking 
in a large room; I sensed the grandeur 
of high ceilings and wide-open studios.

Behind him was a portrait of Billie 

Holiday, Duke Ellington and Fats 
Waller. “This is like a museum,” Lee 
commented, wide-eyed, on the space. 
“This building is a testament to our 
Black artistry.”

The space is filled with the presence 

of greats, mainly in the form of honorific 
portraits. “I’m looking at Denzel right 
now!” Spike cried. “Harry Belafonte is 
downstairs.” On another wall, there’s 
an African National Congress flag 
signed by Nelson Mandela and Winnie 
Madikizela-Mandela during Apartheid. 
Lee repeated this last part for emphasis: 
“During Apartheid!” He leaned back in 
his velvet chair with awe. “Every day I 
come to the office, I see that!”

Throughout the panel discussion, 

Lee and Blanchard stressed the 
importance of honoring the stories of 
people who have come before.

“There was some great shit done 

before you were born,” Lee said. Lee, 
who also works as a professor and 
artistic director of the Graduate Film 
Program at New York University’s 
Tisch School of the Arts, tells his 
students this all the time. To him, 
young creators can only benefit 
from doing their homework on their 
predecessors, “whose shoulders you 
could be hoisted from, if you know who 
they are!”

A set of shoulders like those is 

especially important for creatives who 
come from marginalized backgrounds. 
Blanchard remarked, “You know how 
frustrating it is to teach kids who have 
talent and have interests in a whole lot 
of areas? And then the reality of it is,

Content Warning: sexual assault
Gisela McDaniel grew up in 

predominantly white spaces: She was 
born on a military base in Bellevue, 
Neb., to a Chamorro mother who was 
a sociology professor teaching race and 
ethnicity and a white father enlisted 
in the Navy. On a recent Monday 
afternoon, the Art & Design alum 
spoke about how being raised with a 
pervasive awareness of her Indigenous 
heritage transformed her approach to 
painting.

Rather than becoming fixated on 

the crosscurrents of the art world and 
its western preference for flattening 
its subjects into fetishized objects 
of beauty, McDaniel said she has 
always seen her artistic process as an 
opportunity to break the silence and 
amplify marginalized stories.

McDaniel said that from the 

moment she started creating, she 
reformulated color as a place where 
a body in exile could emerge while 
talking back to the viewer.

“I really don’t like to focus on the 

violence in these stories because I think 
that’s done enough,” she said in an 
interview with The Daily. “Especially 
in art, we see these violent moments 
painted but it’s not about that. What 
I’m so interested in is how people move 
forward and how people are resilient 
through these events.”

McDaniel says she first used the 

language of art to articulate and 
anatomize her life experiences. This 
extends all the way back to her girlhood 
in Cleveland, Ohio, where she says she 
“struggled with language growing up.” 

“The words would kind of get 

stuck,” she told me.

And yet, from the first moment that 

McDaniel began tracing her own form 
as a child — she described this seminal 
self-portrait as “strangely accurate” — 
her mother perceived a shimmering 
talent. Art, she told me, was her first 
form of communication. 

McDaniel took studio art classes 

in high school, initially focusing on 
figure drawing. She said she chose the 
University of Michigan for a Bachelor 
of Fine Arts in Art & Design in 2014 
because she preferred the idea of a 
research university setting. More than 

anything, she said, she yearned for the 
intellectual space to examine what she 
was making her work about. 

McDaniel’s examination of herself 

through her work would eventually 
serve to transform a pivotal, painful 
point in her life in a different direction 
— when she was a sophomore studying 
abroad, she was sexually assaulted 
and, in the aftermath of the event, she 
struggled to paint. 

“It was the first time I couldn’t paint 

for months after it happened. (It) took 
my form of communication away,” she 
told me.

Gradually, however, her work 

became a mode through which she 
could make unspeakable stories legible 
again. She says that it was the artistic 
process that emerged from the event, 
and not the event itself, that was pivotal.

***

Speaking through the paint — 

McDaniel says her current process 
arose from social interactions within 
the Detroit community, where she 
moved shortly after her assault. She 
began making figure drawings of 
friends and acquaintances who chose 
to share their own stories of sexual 
assault. She also started maintaining 
the audio footage of her subjects’ 
stories.

“I’m really interested in creating 

these portals where (my subjects) can 
speak through,” McDaniel said. “I had 
a sensor embedded in the surface of 
the painting. And when you stepped 
within like three feet, (the painting) 
would talk to you. So the story would 
start to speak. You can’t enter the 
personal space of the painting without 
hearing that sound, or hearing that 
person’s voice or their story.”

In this, she seemed to say that healing 

defies codification and 2D spaces. “You 
go in your cocoon, and you become 
something else,” she said, referring to 
the forms of personal growth that can 
emerge from wrenching experiences. 

From there, we talked about how 

the Missing and Murdered Indigenous 
Women 
campaign 
has 
raised 

awareness of elevated rates of sexual 
violence against Indigenous Women 
and how much more prevention is 
needed. On the island of Guam, where 
McDaniel’s family is from, the problem 
has reached astonishingly high levels: 
There are 62.4 reported sexual assaults 
for every 100,000 people, while the 
national average hovers around 25.2 
per 100,000.

“To be able to talk about these 

things, and for it to not be scary or sad 
or for it to be trauma porn but, for it to 
just be (about how) this happens to so 
many of us,” she explained. “It’s almost 
not even our responsibility anymore, 
and that’s why I put the audio in.”

She said that rather than prioritizing 

personal achievements, she chooses to 

put her community first by recording 
intergenerational stories and starting 
conversations. 
For 
example, 
she 

described the process of painting a 
friend whose family is Navajo. The 
friend had grown up with her mother 
and grandmother on the reservation 
but had recently left to work with a 
Catholic missionary in Cleveland, Ohio. 

“The grandmother, the daughter 

and the granddaughter came up 
and we had a three-generation 
conversation because they wanted to 
record their story,” she said. “I guess 
that’s a really clear example of … how 
urgent it is to make sure we don’t lose 
our histories.”

***

Reclaiming the palette — When 

McDaniel was at the University, a 
professor compared the palette she 
uses to Paul Gauguin, a French Post-
Impressionist painter. This inspired 
her to delve into the history behind his 
work, and after learning more about 
the problematic and sometimes non-
consensual ways he interacted with his 
oftentimes female subjects, Gauguin’s 
memory did not sit right with her.

“(Knowing) how he interacted 

with women and Tahiti, and that he 
had married a 13-year-old girl, and 
like gave all these people diseases and 
all these things. There’s so much lack 
of consent in his process,” she said. 
“People are attracted to the colors … 
but it doesn’t feel like they were his to 
paint.”

Seeing Gauguin’s fetishization of 

Pacific Islanders inspired McDaniel 
to turn the process and portrayal of 
painting portraits on its head. She told 
me that this is in large part a response to 
how colonialism has inflicted ongoing 
damage on her family’s home country 
of Guam.

“In Guam right now, there is a 

military base on the north of the island, 
and they’re currently trying to build 
this firing range over all of our sacred 
lands that used to be our family’s land,” 
she said.

In response to this, her art becomes 

her protest. For McDaniel, part of this 

protest comes from objects selected by 
her subjects that clue us in to their life’s 
story. McDaniel told me that the objects 
are often pieces of jewelry passed 
down through matrilineal lines, even 
sometimes coming from other subjects 
who have donated jewelry to her studio 
in Detroit. These objects and the stories 
they represent infiltrate her paintings. 

“There’s always something in the 

work that is giving you hints about 
who this person is,” she said. “And that 
person might be the only person who 
knows that story too … But it means 
something for them, to be able to look 
at it and be able to recall that memory 
because that’s in history now.”

In a way, the voices of subjects who 

are portrayed in McDaniel’s work fuse 
with paint on the canvas to become an 
enduring hybrid language.

As I looked at McDaniel’s paintings, 

and the objects in them, I felt her 
subjects were transported into my 
apartment through another language 
running between the avenues of my 
heart. I became enraptured by the 
object’s rivulets of color and texture. It 
felt like heat seeping into my room. It 
felt electric. 

I estimate that I received the 

equivalent of several college lectures 
in no less than one afternoon from 
McDaniel. As a riveting, unequivocal 
intellectual in her own right, her 
approach to language, history and 
violence leave me feeling as if she is a 
gift from the future — spilling over with 
what will be possible tomorrow.

McDaniel 
is 
currently 
in 
a 

group exhibition at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art Detroit called “Dual 
Visions,” and will soon be presenting 
work in another Midwest exhibition 
titled “The Regional,” opening at MOCA 
Cleveland and the Contemporary Art 
Space in Cincinnati. Finally, she will 
be having a solo exhibition with Pilar 
Corrias in London in the fall, with a date 
to be confirmed later this week. 

Author’s 
note: 
The 
fight 
for 

Indigenous land and water in Guam, 
referred to by McDaniel in this article, is 
known as Prutehi Litekyan. 

Responsibility is not a trait I 

typically associate with creativity, 
but to Easha, a 20-year-old singer-
songwriter, it is everything. 

“It’s definitely a discipline thing,” 

she said in an interview with The 
Daily. “I think as soon as you name 
yourself anything, like, as soon as you 
name yourself, like, I’m an artist, or 
like, I’m a writer, it comes with the 
responsibility of … literally just doing 
it.”

Every day, she writes songs. 

Whether these come from a quick 
flash of inspiration, or her building 
it from the melody up, she works to 
keep at it. “Creativity … people say 
it’s like a muscle,” she told me, one of 
those classic truisms that seem trite — 
except for the fact that it’s an accurate 
and difficult rule to keep. People who 
stick to a creative regimen deserve a 
little cliché now and then.

Easha has found an audience 

for her creativity largely through 
social media. Her sound is dreamy 
and nostalgic, starting out mostly 
on guitar but taking on a bedroom 
pop sound in production. Her top 
song, “Dying Is a Beautiful Thing 
to Do,” has over a million hits, after 
gaining popularity on TikTok and 
Instagram. Among her fans are well-
known artists like Jacob Collier and 
Lizzy McAlpine — their attention 
was something she admitted to 
freaking out about when it first 
happened, especially since they both 
followed her Instagram on the same 
day.

“I was like, ‘What the fuck?’” she 

said. The moment of being able to 
tell her friends that someone famous 
followed her was a landmark memory 
for the Stanford University student.

Easha returns to the theme of 

responsibility while discussing her 
audience. “I think that you have a 

responsibility to yourself as an artist 
to, you know, bring your ideas to life,” 
she reflected. “Especially now that 
I kind of have an audience, I do want 
to, like, feed them,” she said, giggling 
slightly.

However, she maintained that she 

did not keep her fans in mind when 
writing songs. “I think it’s almost a 
disservice to them as well, because 
… they put their trust in me.” This is 
certainly a point worth considering 
as she grows in popularity: Staying 
true to the music she made before the 
fans started to accumulate is another 
cliché that is also true, and more 
difficult than it sounds.

One particular question I had 

was about the title of her breakout 
single, “Dying Is a Beautiful Thing 
to Do.” At first glance, it seems 
controversial from a mental health 
standpoint. It was popularized on 
platforms like TikTok, where many 
go to openly discuss their mental 
diagnoses. However, upon listening 
to the lyrics, one hears “Dying is a 
beautiful thing to do / By your side.” 
Her breathy delivery draws out the 
romance intended when writing the 
song.

Easha talked about how she 

learned from other writers about “a 
hook” — the twist that catches you 
off guard, something clearly used 
in this song. While a love tune is not 
what you expect after reading the 
title, the dreamy style of the popular 
piece 
integrates 
the 
romance 

throughout.

It’s easy to forget with all of her 

success that Easha is still in her 
freshman year of college. She spent 
a gap year in Nashville gigging, 
performing and making connections 
until it was cut short by the 
pandemic. The transition from the 
Nashville audience to the online one 
was abrupt.

Rina Sawayama and Elton 

John shine light on the 
beauty of chosen families

Last week, Elton John and 

British-Japanese 
musician 
Rina 

Sawayama collaborated on a remix 
of the track “Chosen Family,” a 
queer anthem released in April 
of last year on Sawayama’s debut 
album, SAWAYAMA. 

The two pop powerhouses 

became unlikely friends following 
Sawayama’s album release last 
spring, when John named the 
project his “favorite of the year” 
on his Apple Music radio show, 
“Elton John’s Rocket Hour.” Since 
then, John has been supportive 
of Sawayama’s efforts to broaden 
the participation of non-British 
citizens in the Brit Awards and 
Mercury Prize competition, so it’s 
unsurprising that the two have 
finally collaborated musically. 

The 
pairing 
may 
seem 

unexpected, 
yet 
despite 
their 

existence in two different eras of 
pop, Sawayama and John mesh 
surprisingly well. Both have taken 
on a chameleon-like role in the 
pop industry, successfully fusing 
elements of R&B and rock into their 
work, and earning critical acclaim. 
Most importantly on “Chosen 
Family,” both artists also share a 
passion for supporting LGBTQ+ 
causes. Sawayama, who identifies 
as both bisexual and pansexual, 
and John, who is openly gay and 
often been labeled a “queer icon,” 
both have a considerable following 
in the LGBTQ+ community. The 
track’s focus on the topic of “chosen 
families” feels especially intimate 
given 
their 
tightly-knit 
queer 

fanbases. 

The term “chosen family” signifies 

a group of friends and non-blood 
relatives who act as a makeshift 
family for those with unaccepting 
biological families. It’s a concept 
prevalent in the queer community 
and highlighted on TV shows like 
“Pose,” which centers on drag ball 
culture among the Black and Latinx 
LGBTQ+ communities in 1980s New 
York. In essence, the idea of a chosen 
family pivots on the notion that, while 
traditional family members may not 
always be supportive of their queer 
relatives, the queer community is 
more than willing to step into the role 
if need be. 

With the constant passage of 

anti-trans and anti-gay legislation 
in the United States — in particular, 
a bill allowing schools to inspect 

the genitalia of student-athletes in 
Florida last week — it’s clear that 
just existing as a queer person is 
an emotionally taxing experience. 
When describing the purpose of 
“Chosen Family,” Sawayama states, 
“The concept of chosen family has 
been long-standing in the queer 
community because a lot of people 
get kicked out of their homes and 
get ostracized from their family 
for coming out or just living true 
to themselves. I wanted to write a 
song literally for them, and it’s just a 
message and this idea of a safe space 
— an actual physical space.”

The 
track 
does 
just 
that, 

promising the listener that they 
“don’t need to share genes or a 
surname” or “be related to relate.” 
It’s sincere and uplifting, giving 
the overall effect of a warm hug in 
a world that is consistently hostile 
toward queer people. 

“Chosen Family” sounds like it 

could be on a Disney soundtrack, 
something 
I 
wouldn’t 
usually 

consider merit. Yet Sawayama and 
John are so genuine on the track, it’s 
hard to bear any ill will toward it. In 
fact, the new recording feels just as 
heartfelt as the original. 

Instead of the spare techno 

pulses of the album version, soft 
piano accompaniment comes to the 
forefront on the new release. John’s 
vocals never rival Sawayama’s in 
clarity and strength, but the pair’s 
voices blend in such triumphant 
harmony by the track’s conclusion. 
It’s not a revolutionary reimagining 
of the song, but with emotional 
violin swells and tender lyricism, 
“Chosen Family” is an important life 
mantra wrapped in a honeyed pop 
exterior. 

“Chosen Family” doesn’t feel 

gimmicky or cloying, likely because 
it’s the collaboration of two artists 
that actually belong to the queer 
community (I love Taylor, but “You 
Need to Calm Down” felt a little self-
serving).

In a New York Times interview 

last week, Sawayama stated, “… 
queering a space, that’s kind of 
what I’m trying to do with music 
by injecting a bit of an interest in 
areas other than heterosexual love.” 
There’s a sense of queer autonomy 
on the track, which makes it all the 
more empowering. 

Sawayama and John bridge 

two generations of queer pop on 
“Chosen Family,” while reminding 
us to surround ourselves with people 
willing to give us unconditional love 
and support no matter our identity.

If you asked a rap fan in 2010 who their favorite 

female rapper was, chances are that list would begin 
and end at “Nicki Minaj.” While the 90s and early 
2000s brought lots of talent to the table for female 
rap with trailblazers like Lil’ Kim and Missy Elliot, 
the decline of their careers in mainstream rap left a 
hole in the industry that only Minaj seemed to be able 
to fill. However, in recent years, several new female 
rappers have emerged, making a name for themselves 
in the rap game. Stars like Megan Thee Stallion and 
Cardi B have climbed the charts to be at the forefront 
of the genre. From conscious rap to party anthems, 
these women’s distinct styles and flows command 
the attention of hip-hop heads who otherwise may 
not have explored past their favorite male rappers. 
After taking a deep dive into female rap myself, I’ve 
found a plethora of female emcees, or “femcees” as I 
like to call them, that have empowered me through 
song, whether that be through providing intellectual 
stimulation or just giving me a song to dance to in the 
mirror while doing my makeup. Because of this, I’d 
like to spread my love for lady rappers by sharing a 
few of my personal favorite tracks as an introduction 
to their wildly diverse sounds.

1. “Countin’ Up” – Rico Nasty 
“Countin’ Up” was the very first track I thought 

of when creating this list because it was the song 
that really got me into listening to female rappers. 
Rico Nasty is a rapper based in the DMV area. She 
stepped into the limelight after making the 2019 
Freshman XXL Class, which has helped launch 
the careers of other rappers like Lil Uzi Vert, 
21 Savage and the late Juice Wrld. When I first 
listened to this song, I was immediately impressed 
by Rico’s effortless flow. My favorite lyrics from 
this song are “Who you frontin’ on? Come on girl, 
I know you a rookie / You got some followers, so 
what? Do you want you a cookie?” As seen in her 
performance, her sense of humor shines through 
her lyricism and lively tone. What I really love and 
find truly innovative about Rico is her ability to 
incorporate elements of punk rock into a lot of her 
music. Her confident, carefree lyrics and unique 
song production make her discography one of my 
favorites to keep diving back into.

2. “Saggy Denim” – Princess Nokia ft. Wiki
Princess Nokia, most known for her 2020 hit 

single “I Like Him,” is a rapper who has only kept 
ascending into the limelight in recent months. 
“Saggy Denim” is my personal favorite track by 
Nokia, from her sophomore album 1992 Deluxe. 
The New York rapper effortlessly glides over this 

90s-inspired instrumental, rapping about her 
home city and Puerto Rican heritage. She even 
incorporates a bit of Spanglish into her verses, 
rapping “I speak that ‘mira, mira,’ that ‘mira, oye 
linda’ / That ‘ven aqui mi’jita, tu eres mi chiquita.’” 
This verse translates to “ I speak that ‘Look, look,’ 
that ‘look, hey pretty girl’ / That ‘Come here, my 
little daughter, you are my little girl.’” I’ve always 
interpreted these lines as a reference to words 
spoken by her Puerto Rican grandmother, who she 
lived with throughout her teen years. As a whole, 
his song encompasses New York City as Princess 
Nokia sees it, and her love for her hometown and 
culture is clear in every verse. 

3. “Roaring 20s” – Flo Milli
Flo Milli first blew up with her viral hit “Beef Flo 

Mix”, which gained lots of popularity on the social 
media app TikTok. She is well known for her boastful 
lyrics and animated rap style. For me, listening to a 
Flo Milli song is the quickest way to get an instant 
confidence boost. “Roaring 20s” is the rapper’s latest 
single, released in January 2021. The song, produced 
by Kenny Beats (who has also produced much of Rico 
Nasty’s discography), samples classic song “If I Were 
A Rich Man” by placing the distinguishable melody 
over a trap instrumental. The music video also 
incorporates outfits and visuals that are reminiscent 
of the historical Roaring 20’s. At only 21, Flo Milli is 
already en route to being a consistent hitmaker. 

4. “Rainforest” – Noname
Noname, another Chicago native, first entered 

the mainstream rap world when she was featured 
on Chance The Rapper’s song “Lost” from his 2013 
mixtape Acid Rap. Today, she is most known for 
her 2016 mixtape Telefone and is closely associated 
with other Chicago-based rappers like Smino and 
Saba. On “Rainforest,” Noname calls out the irony 
of glorifying billionaires and capitalism with lines 
like, “How you make excuses for billionaires, you 
broke on the bus?” Noname falls more heavily into 
the category of conscious rap than other rappers. 
She typically uses her songs to address social 
issues and share her own self-criticisms. This song 
is particularly exciting to me because it’s the first 
track she has released since her diss track from last 
summer, “Song 33,” where she addressed criticism 
from rapper J. Cole about the tone of her activism. 
In addition to dropping “Rainforest,” she also 
announced that she’ll be releasing another studio 
album called Factory Baby later this year. Long-term 
Noname fans like myself will be eagerly waiting for 
this drop.

Hopefully these songs allow for a small glimpse 

into the vast, everexanding world of female rap. You 
can find these tracks and more on my Spotify playlist 
called “femcees”.

Hope within borders: The impending movement of the North Korean People

Content warning: This piece discusses 

North Korea, and subsequently details of (at 
times graphic) physical violence and trauma. 

“Freedom,” to Joseph Kim, a 31-year-old 

human rights activist and North Korean 
defector, “is like air. You can’t touch it or see 
it. We don’t think about it or appreciate it 
when we have it. But we notice it when we 
don’t have it, just like we notice when we 
don’t have oxygen.”

When the Western world thinks of North 

Korea, people’s minds often go to Kim Jong 
Un and his nuclear missiles or propaganda 
images of vast military parades rather than 
the diverse groups of individuals who call it 
home. This is why LiNK’s mission is to stress 
“people over politics” and thereby fight for 
the rights of average North Korean civilians.

On April 1, Joseph, author of “Under the 

Same Sky: From Starvation in North Korea 
to Salvation in America,” and Hannah Song, 
president and CEO of Liberty in North 
Korea, spoke over Zoom with students 
at the University of Michigan. Liberty 
in North Korea, or LiNK, is a non-profit 
organization dedicated to aiding North 
Korean people in the struggle against their 
totalitarian government and to rescuing and 
rehabilitating North Korean refugees who 
have crossed the border into China. 

However, these defectors’ journeys, once 

they’ve arrived in China, are still harrowing. 
Unlike the rest of the international council, 
the Chinese government does not recognize 
North Korean defectors as refugees; in 
fact, it has a longstanding agreement with 
North Korea to send any caught defectors 
back to their home country. If deported 
back to the country, the defectors often face 
harsh punishments such as beatings, forced 
labor, torture and internment. Additionally, 
it is estimated that 60% of North Korean 
women who escape to China are trafficked, 
sold as brides by their brokers to the highest 
bidder. To avoid such persecution, LiNK 
guides defectors through a rescue route 

that stretches the roughly 3,000-mile span 
from the North Korean border in China to 
Southeast Asia. To put that into perspective, 
it is nearly 300 miles longer than the distance 
from New York to Los Angeles. Eventually, 
refugees are rehabilitated through job 
training, stipends, resources and housing. 
LiNK has thus far rescued 1,201 North 
Korean refugees. Since his ascent to power 
in 2011, Kim Jong Un’s harsh crackdowns 
on border security have cut the amount 
of North Korean refugees who manage to 
escape to South Korea in half.

But four years preceding the Supreme 

Leader’s rise, Joseph arrived in the United 
States of America, at 17 years old. He and 
Hannah, whom he calls “noona” (meaning 
older sister in Korean), are powerful, 
commanding presences, even through 
Zoom. Hannah is extremely charismatic 
and her voice brims with passion. I get the 
impression that nearly everything she says 
to the U-M students she has said many, 
many times before — not in a performatively 
rehearsed way, but out of her dedication to 
sharing these stories as often as she can, 
with whoever will listen to her. In colloquial 
conversation, Hannah is vibrant and fun — 
she refers to Joseph as “Jo Bro” and calls 
him her “brother from another mother” — 
and when she is speaking about the plight 
of the North Korean people, her vigor 
seems inexhaustible. Joseph, on the other 
hand, possesses an air of quiet dignity. His 
voice is soft and gentle, but some quality 
about him commands respect — perhaps 
it’s his pensiveness and apparent careful 
consideration of his words as he gathers 
his thoughts to speak. His and Hannah’s 
collaboration feels natural and moving, and 
despite the heavy subject matter they have to 
impart, the two try to joke around whenever 
they can. At one point, Joseph commends 
Hannah for her dedication to LiNK and she 
tells him to keep complimenting her. Later, 
Joseph also jokingly accuses Hannah of 
embarrassing him for putting him on the 
spot with a question. In response, she simply 
smiles and says, “Then my job is done.” 

***

Hannah and Joseph have dedicated their 

lives to providing aid to the North Korean 
people until the people can eventually 
free themselves from their regime. The 
suffering 
which 
millions 
of 
average 

North Korean citizens endure today, as 
a result of Draconian rule, is entirely too 
vast to summarize in a single article. In 
2014, the United Nations Commission of 
Inquiry conducted an investigation into 
human rights violations in North Korea 
and concluded that “in many instances, 
the violations of human rights found by 
the commission constitute crimes against 
humanity. … The gravity, scale and nature 
of these violations reveal a State that does 
not have any parallel in the contemporary 
world.”

To combat these issues, activist and then-

student Adrian Hong and comedian Paul 
“PK” Kim co-founded the organization 
Liberty in North Korea, at Yale University 
in March of 2004, originally under the 
name “Liberation in North Korea.” (The 
two co-founders eventually moved on to 
different projects.)

Hannah said she has not always been 

cognizant of the suffering which plagues 
North Koreans: She claims that before the 
advent of Google, very few Americans knew 
about the human rights violations by the 
regime. It wasn’t until she read defector 
Kang Chol-Hwan’s memoir, co-authored by 
historian Pierre Rigoulot, “The Aquariums 
of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North 
Korean Gulag,” that she started to grow 
educated about the humanitarian crisis. In 
2006, she quit her corporate advertising job 
to devote herself full-time to aiding North 
Korean refugees, and two years later Hong 
selected her for the position of LiNK’s CEO.

Today, LiNK, whose headquarters are 

now based in Long Beach, Calif. (with an 
office in Seoul), has more than 100 global 
chapters, and its U-M chapter was founded 
in 2009.

LSA junior Joyce Jeong was recently 

announced to be the next president of the U-M 
chapter for the 2021-2022 academic year. 

“One of my biggest frustrations (about life 

under the regime) is there’s just no access to 
be intellectually curious,” Jeong said. “If 

you have the smallest curiosity, you have 
no outlet to explore that… No music, no 
media and … North Korea has so many fear-
mongering tactics where it’s like you can’t 
even think about things without having 
some sort of consequence.”

As 
an 
underclassman, 
Jeong 
had 

deliberated over whether or not to 
fully devote herself to LiNK. 
One reason she ultimately 
committed to the cause, 
in her words, is that 
“you don’t hear about 
North Korea in the 
news because … they 
don’t have the right 
to join assembly, they 
don’t have the right to 
religion, they don’t have 
the right to media… The 
fact that we know so little about 
(North Korea) should raise a sense of 
urgency.”

Pre-pandemic, LiNK at the University 

could be seen periodically at Mason Hall, 
a plastic table set up adjacent to one of the 
wood-paneled walls, and on it, a poster 
with “Liberty in North Korea” spelled out 
in large, red letters, alongside the various 
snacks they were selling to raise funds. In 
this past academic year, the U-M chapter has 
had to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic by 
taking its meetings to Zoom and drumming 
up innovative new fundraising ideas, like 
a talent auction and virtual dating game 
show. The LiNK headquarters requires 
roughly $3,000 to rescue and rehabilitate 
one North Korean refugee, and Jeong 
states that, despite the challenges that the 
two virtual semesters presented, the U-M 
chapter has managed to raise an impressive 
$6,000 in the past year alone.

***

Despite the U-M chapter’s fundraising 

success, the COVID-19 pandemic has 
effectively severed communication and 
financial support between many defectors 
and their family members who remain 
in the country. The pandemic has also 
severely hurt North Koreans’ chances of 
defecting from the country and resettling 

in South Korea because the regime 
quickly capitalized on the threat of the 
novel coronavirus by enforcing tighter 
controls at the state’s borders. According 
to Hannah, the most recent people whom 
LiNK was able to help to defect from the 

country escaped North Korea over a 

year ago, in January 2020. Even 

in China and Southeast 

Asia, with heightened 

movement 
controls 

and 
checkpoints, 

the 
underground 

pathway that leads 
to asylum in South 
Korea is much more 
difficult to navigate 
than it was in pre-

pandemic times.
Despite 
these 

challenges — whose effects, 

according to Hannah, may linger for 

the next decade — it is as vital as ever that 
North Korean defectors continue to reach 
safety in other nations because if discovered, 
their attempted escapes often have dire 
consequences. In Hannah’s talk at the 
University, she recounts one woman’s failed 
effort to escape to China: After she and her 
5-year-old daughter were apprehended for 
attempting to cross the river, she was beaten 
by a guard and then forced to watch as her 
own child was beaten and kicked until blood 
spilled from her mouth. Hannah shared 
another woman’s story of defecting from 
North Korea and attempting to meet with 
LiNK for aid in crossing into Southeast Asia: 
The woman’s husband and elder child were 
found by Chinese plainclothes officers and 
eventually repatriated. While she tried to 
hide with her two-year-old child to avoid 
capture, she covered her baby’s mouth 
to conceal any cries, and after she finally 
emerged, she realized she had accidentally 
suffocated her baby. The woman had to dig 
a shallow grave for her child and eventually 
make her way into Southeast Asia, alone.

In honor of Black Maternal Health Week

My mother often describes the 

births of my siblings and I with an 
unmatched sense of happiness. Her 
testimony of how she was able to 
bring new life into the world four 
different times quickly turns into a 
sentimental recount of what it felt 
like to hold each of her babies for the 
first time, all while in the presence 
of loved ones. When it comes to my 
birth specifically, she says it was an 
“easy birth” with minimal pain. As 
far as her experiences with my three 
siblings, it was not as smooth sailing 
and pain-free (as you can see, I am the 
good child). However, she never fails 
to mention that whatever physical 
and emotional pain she experienced 
was soon overshadowed by an 
overwhelming sense of joy. Those 
days go down as arguably the best 
days of her — and my father’s — life. 
As standard as this may sound, this 
isn’t every mother’s birth story. For 
some mothers, the tears cried on this 
day aren’t tears of joy, but of pain and 
loss. And this day, which is supposed 
to be the best day of their lives, ends 
up being their last.

Given that the United States 

is riddled with over-medicalized 
births and an inequitable health care 
system, it is not surprising that we 
have the highest rates of maternal 
mortality amongst developed nations. 
This is a problem that is endured by 
women of all backgrounds. However, 
in a society that is still characterized 
by institutionalized racism, it would 
be naive not to acknowledge that 
minority 
women 
— 
specifically 

Black women — bear the brunt of 
this burden. In fact, Black women 
are more than three to four times 
more likely to experience pregnancy-
related mortality or morbidity in 
comparison to white women, as 
well as more than twice as likely 
to experience maternal mortality 
compared to non-Black women of 
color. To make matters worse, the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
widened this gap. Continued racial 
discrimination, as well as a lack of 
space in Black hospitals to service 
both COVID-19 patients and laboring 
mothers, has worsened the state of 
Black maternal health.

While others used to try and 

explain away this disparity by 
blaming it on a lack of education 
and financial stability in Black 
communities, the discovery that 
a wealthy, college-educated Black 
woman is more likely to experience a 
pregnancy-related death than a poor 
white woman who did not graduate 
high school has since disproved 
this. There are many theories that 
explain racial differences in maternal 

mortality, one of the most prominent 
being Arline Geronimus’s Weathering 
Hypothesis. This theory states that 
biological consequences of the stress 
resulting from racism that Black 
women face can be linked to negative 
maternal health outcomes. Racism, 
which is inherently stress-inducing, 
can cause cells to divide and die at an 
abnormally rapid rate, resulting in the 
body’s premature aging. This can then 
cause an increased risk of chronic 
conditions such as diabetes and high 
blood pressure, both of which can 
lead to pregnancy complications and 
maternal mortality. Essentially, the 
body lacks the ability to promote 
a healthy pregnancy when the 
mother is faced with chronic stress, 
such as that from racism and other 
unquantifiable systems. While this 
theory can be applied to all stress 
regardless of cause, the ways in 
which anti-Black racism is embedded 
into the very structure of the U.S. 
makes stress a much more chronic 
issue for Black women than anyone 
else. This theory, paired with the 
history of unnecessarily high rates 
of cesarean sections done on Black 
women and lack of health care 
access in predominantly Black areas 
provides ample explanation for this 
maternal health disparity. With 
this plethora of information, it has 
become increasingly clear over time 
that Black women’s right to life is 
under attack.

This ongoing threat to Black 

motherhood presents an undeniable 
threat to the quality of life that 
is available to Black women and 
families. 
Black 
women 
— 
like 

everyone else — should never have to 
fear that their delivery bed will also 
be their deathbed. The ability to leave 
the delivery room alive and with the 
physical and emotional capacity to 
care for their newborn child should 
be a reality that women of all races 
can be guaranteed to experience. 
Currently, this is not the case. 

Not only is the disparity in 

maternal mortality severe in its 
magnitude, but it is also two-tiered 
in its nature. The Black maternal 
health crisis is undeniably a result of 
the racism experienced both in the 
health care system and in everyday 
life. The physiological stress that 
is produced, as well as the lack of 
medical support in urgent medical 
situations 
experienced 
by 
Black 

people, has detrimental impacts to all 
aspects of health. However, given the 
lack of agency and autonomy during 
childbirth among women of all races, 
disparities in maternal mortality 
and mortality are also perpetuated 
by 
gender-based 
discrimination. 

Ultimately, 
the 
ways 
in 
which 

medical racism and gender-based 
discrimination work intersectionally 
to harm Black mothers at a disparate 

rate shows the double jeopardy that 
Black women experience due to the 
consequences of both. Because of 
this, the eradication of this disparity 
will require initiatives that cater to 
the specific needs of Black women.

This is why Black Maternal Health 

Week exists. Created by the Black 
Mamas Matter Alliance, it is a week 
in April (every April 11-17 to be exact) 
devoted to advocating for solutions to 
the Black maternal health crisis. The 
initiative also provides a platform for 
Black mothers’ and families’ stories 
to be heard in a space where they 
will be valued. Additionally, Black 
Maternal Health Week takes place 
during National Minority Health 
Month in April and contributes to 
the larger conversation of making 
health experiences and outcomes 
equitable for people of color. For the 
past three years, the Black Mamas 
Matter Alliance has hosted the 
Black Maternal Health Conference, 
in which participants are able to 
build their capacity in shaping Black 
maternal health policy, programs and 
advocacy, while also learning how to 
address maternal health disparities in 
different career sectors and building 
community among Black women. 
Through these events and the other 
resources they offer, Black Maternal 
Health week has created room for the 
issue of Black maternal health and 
mortality, as well as possible solutions 
for the Black women and families 
who will benefit from it the most. 

Another victory of the Black 

Mamas Matter Alliance is its success 
of getting maternal health inequities 
prioritized by those with the political 
power 
to 
enact 
progress. 
The 

Congressional Black Maternal Health 
Caucus, established by U.S. Rep. Alma 
Adams, N.C.-12, and U.S. Rep. Lauren 
Underwood, D-Ill., in April 2019, is 
a manifestation of the political and 
societal change that Black Maternal 
Health Week has been advocating 
for. Just like the Black Mamas Matter 
Alliance, the Congressional Black 
Maternal Health Caucus aims to 
diminish the disparities in maternal 
mortality rates between Black women 
and white women. In June 2019, the 
caucus approved multiple priority 
initiatives including funding for 
research on maternal health disparity, 
the promotion of breastfeeding in 
hospitals (another maternal health 
disparity), funding for more midwife 
education in order to diversify the 
field, funding for community-based 
organizations that are dedicated to 
improving Black maternal health, the 
provision of support for incarcerated 
mothers (given that Black women 
make up a majority of the female 
prison population) and more.

The Instagram face and its implications

Do you remember the Kylie Jenner 

lip challenge in 2015? The internet 
went under her spell as countless teens 
took to social media to share videos of 
themselves suctioning their lips inside 
a shot glass, hoping to recreate Kylie’s 
voluptuous (and artificial) lips. The 
results of the challenge were grotesque: 
Participants would end up with 
bloodshot, bruised and swollen lips, and 
some teens were sent to the ER for their 
injuries. Looking back on the challenge 
six years later, I have come to realize 
that a trend I initially found hilarious 
as a child was, is in fact, a symptom 
of a much larger issue: the mindless 
replication of the Instagram look.

What is the Instagram face? Go on 

the Instagram Explore Page, and you 
will soon find out. Most women able to 
garner fame and praise through their 
appearance on social media have very 
similar faces; it is as if their features 
follow a specific template. Based on my 
observations as an avid social media 
user, the “look” often includes:

1.) 
A 
youthful, 
heart-shaped 

face; 2.) A small button nose with 
an upturned tip; 3.) Full lips with a 
defined philtrum; 4.) Full, but well-
groomed brows; 5.) Upturned, cat-like 
eyes; 6.) A defined, forward-pointing 
chin and a chiseled jawline to match; 
7.) High cheekbones; 8.) Defined 
lashes sometimes achieved through 
extensions; 9.) Tan, dewy skin; 10.) The 
length of the nose perfectly trisects the 
rest of the face; 11.) Distance between 
the eyes being equal the width of one 
eye; 12.) Natural-looking makeup; 13.)
Voluptuous bust and buttocks; 14.) A 
tiny waist with defined abdominals; 
15.) Long, shiny hair; 16.) Never 
repeating an outfit and always trendy. 

The Instagram look is racially 

ambiguous, as it includes many 
features commonly found in Black 
women, Indigenous women and other 
women of color. However, BIPOC 
women who naturally have these 
features, compared to rich white and 
white-adjacent women who have 
gone through cosmetic procedures 
to achieve the same features for 
aesthetic’s sake, are rarely given the 
same level of acclaim or endorsements 
for their natural beauty. 

The 
Kardashians 
are 
known 

for going under the knife and 
appropriating ethnic styles to achieve 
a racially ambiguous look, all the while 

denying they have gotten cosmetic 
procedures, 
thus 
further 
raising 

beauty standards for women. Kylie 
Jenner underwent a lip-enhancing 
procedure in her teen years that 
broke the internet, making her the 
pioneer of the Instagram face. She has 
been able to market and create a lip 
product line so successful it elevated 
her to the status of a “self-made” 
multi-millionaire. Through excessive 
tanning, getting procedures to plump 
their lips and creating a more curvy 
figure, the Kardashians are effectively 
appropriating 
Black 
and 
brown 

features as their own. By becoming 
the trademarked beauty standard in 
the 2010s, the famous family did erase 
and is still actively erasing BIPOC 
beauty and encouraging more white 
and white-adjacent women to follow 
suit in appropriating these features.

Consider how we take naturally full 

lips on Black girls for granted, 
but Kylie Jenner’s surgically 
altered ones are admired 
and emulated. White 
models routinely use 
fake or spray tan to 
appear darker and 
more exotic, while 
darker-skinned 
women are rarely 
praised for their 
natural skin tone. 
BIPOC 
women 

often face colorism 
and even sometimes 
pressure to become 
lighter. Also consider 
how East Asians have 
always 
been 
mocked 

through the racist gesture of 
pulling one’s eyes back, but when 
white models are doing said gesture in 
the name of fashion or a more “lifted” 
look, they are deemed as beautiful.

The appropriation doesn’t end at 

BIPOC features — Instagrammers and 
celebrities alike are also appropriating 
BIPOC styles and creativity. A lot of 
the styles popularized by social media, 
such as bandannas and streetwear, 
were worn almost exclusively by Black 
and brown people before the age of 
social media. Through appropriating 
Black and brown creativity, white 
influencers 
and 
celebrities 
have 

commodified styles that used to 
be more accessible to the general 
public. For instance, certain Nike 
sneakers used to be much cheaper 
when they were much more popular 
within minority groups. After the 

popularization of sneaker styles such 
as the Jordan Mids, resell prices then 
skyrocketed 
to 
maximize 
profit, 

thus excluding the communities that 
popularized the style in the first place.

The majority of society are viewing 

these flawlessly posed and edited 
images of Instagram models. Upon 
being bombarded by these images 
of beautiful women online, people 
will subconsciously raise and isolate 
the standard for what it means to 
be feminine and attractive. While 
cis-gendered, heterosexual men are 
viewing these influencers for their 
own enjoyment, as they are likely 
attracted to the models’ physicality, 
women and female-presenting people 
are almost always viewing these 
models for inspiration, in pursuit 
of their beauty, which then turns 
into critical self-deprecation. We 
are socialized to view each other as 

competition. The patriarchy 

encourages us to center our 

physical attractiveness 

at the core of our 

identities, and as a 
result we often view 
ourselves critically 
and take actions, 
such as putting 
on 
makeup 
or 

getting cosmetic 
procedures, 
in 
hopes 
of 

becoming 
more 

“beautiful.” 

Instagram 

models prey on other 

women’s 
insecurities. 

While 
following 
and 

viewing 
your 
favorite 

influencers can start out 

innocently, it almost always leads to 
some kind of comparative self-esteem 
issue. The majority of women and girls 
do not have the same access to makeup 
artists, trainers or nutritionists as 
these models. Therefore, women who 
do not have these resources may feel 
bad about themselves when compared 
to the highly manufactured images 
of Instagram models. Young women, 
and especially teens, without a fully 
developed identity and body image, 
can easily develop self-image issues 
and even eating disorders in pursuit of 
the elusive ideal. 

This beauty standard is so elusive 

that the small fraction of girls who do fit 
into it are getting brand endorsement 
deals, which used to be unthinkable 
before the age of social media. These 

opportunities naturally invoke some 
level of insecurity in other women. 
Like the name “influencer” entails, 
the influencers take advantage of their 
followers’ insecurities and influence 
them to purchase more makeup or 
trendy clothes that often come from 
unethical fast fashion brands. 

Some women have gotten multiple 

forms of cosmetic procedures to 
replicate the Instagram look. Procedures 
such as breast lifts and buttock lifts 
have increased exponentially since the 
beginning of the century, coinciding 
with the rise of social media.

At “best,” men dismiss women they 

find unattractive. At their worst, men 
abuse women they find unattractive, 
especially in romantic partnerships. 
Because of how society treats beauty as 
an integral part of a woman’s identity, 
and if their beauty does not meet a 
certain standard, they could face 
professional and societal limitations, 
in comparison to women who do fit 
that standard. As beauty standards 
become more particular and less 
attainable, society as a whole becomes 
more accustomed to the aesthetic 
expectation of these women online, 
and in real life, there will be a larger 
bracket of women who they might 
deem unattractive. To some extent, 
this will lead to the mistreatment 
of women who are deemed as 
conventionally unattractive. 

On most social media platforms, 

once you interact with influencers, 
the algorithm takes notice and pushes 
more posts of the same genre to you. 
Thus, Instagram models are gradually 
becoming 
omnipresent 
on 
most 

people’s timelines and explore pages. 
While viewing these carefully curated 
images can be exhausting and make 
us insecure, consider that nobody is 
perfect in the way these images are. 
The pictures you see on social media 
are posed and edited: Sometimes even 
with a team behind the model, helping 
her create the best image of herself. 
Knowing how harmful these beauty 
standards are to young girls, there 
are now influencers who are actively 
defying them by posting untouched 
images of their faces and bodies, 
showing their authentic selves.

To whom this may concern: Please 

do take social media breaks if you need 
it! Unfollow the influencers and delete 
the apps if that helps, and always 
keep in mind that pictures posted by 
celebrities are often as manufactured 
as can be.

Mother tongue

Despite 
being 

surrounded by it for 
my entire life, I am 
not 
entirely 
fluent 

in Arabic. There has 
always been a twinge of 
shame 
underlying 
that 

fact, 
breeding 
a 
strange 

sense of inadequacy in me. No 
matter how much I’d like for it to 
be 

different, my proficiency in the language is capricious 
at best. I grew up immersed in my family’s colorful 
Algerian dialect, utilizing it to communicate with my 
grandparents or decipher the occasional scolding I 
received from my mother. Beyond that, I’d always felt 
that what was supposed to be my “mother tongue” sat 
awkwardly in my mouth like dead weight. It fumbled 
the pronunciation of Arabic words, distinctly marking 
me as an imposter when communicating with my 
friends who spoke the language with ease. They 
watched as I struggled with the complex inflections 
that the language demands, unable to muster the 
skillful “-kh” sound or achieve the masterful rolling 
of “r”s with any believable intensity. A red flush crept 
across my face every time someone discovered my 
descent and asked “Inti bthakee Arabi?” (Do you speak 
Arabic?), as I knew that my response would have to be 
a feeble shrug or a lackluster “kind of.” 

That ambiguous “kind of” was qualified by a sizable 

inventory of words and phrases I’d collected throughout 
my life, furtively stowed away in my mind and ready to 
be wielded at any moment that required me to prove my 
validity. I’d learned enough Arabic to navigate family 
situations or conversations with strangers, but never 
enough to gossip about a teacher with my classmates. 
Just enough to get to claim the identity, but never enough 
to claim the language. Despite the looming presence 
it had in my life, Arabic remained largely foreign; any 
interaction I had with it left me feeling like a tourist in 
what was supposed to be my own home.

For a long time, I felt such a strong disconnect 

between myself and my identity — one that I was 
convinced only fluency in the language could bridge. 
I hated the way I sounded “American” every time 
I attempted to slip into Arabic pronunciations or 
the way that words clashed in my throat in frenzied 
discordance. As I grew older, I gained the ability to 
understand most of what I was hearing but could never 
respond with the same ease. I coveted the beauty of 
the language, the way it melted in mouths like butter, 
effortless like silk or honey or true belonging. But with 
each syllable and stressed note dying in my mouth, I 
settled for the silence and languished in the listening. 

While I viewed my lack of fluency in Arabic as a 

deficit in the later years of my life, this was never the 
case when I was a child. Rather, I was enamored by 
the mystical nature of the language, deeming it a world 
of opportunity and never considering myself to be 
condemned from its gates. 

I was particularly enraptured by watching members 

of my family perform the five daily Islamic prayers, a 
beautiful language in their own right. When I was old 
enough to begin praying, I learned by mirroring my 
mother’s movements; I followed each graceful bow of 
her unwavering frame, eagerly awaiting the next cue: 
a triumphant rise, a humble bend, an imperceptible 
yet controlled sway. When it came time to attach 
holy words to those movements, I had to resort to 
learning the sounds of each Surah (prayer). Unable to 
understand the words, I internalized the way they rose 
and collided against each other like waves, committing 
their dynamic movements to memory. I prayed through 
mimicry, reciting a series of noises that had yet to have 
any perceivable definition underlying them. 

Everything about these daily prayers was steeped 

in an indescribable divinity, a sacredness that was just 
out of reach despite its warmth feeling unmistakably 
close. I continued to pray, reciting the sounds from 
memory, moving through the motions with a learned 
knowingness that was tinged with a shadow of doubt 
about the efficacy of my performance. Beyond that 
doubt sat an even darker fear: Does this count? If I’m 
just repeating from memory without knowing the weight 
of the words I’m uttering… am I truly praying? Being 
a stranger to Quranic vocabulary, there seemed to 
be an insurmountable cleft between the words I was 
whispering and the sanctity of the meaning they held. I 
feared that I would fall into that dark chasm separating 
practice and understanding — a fate that no amount 
of mimicry could save me from if I didn’t possess an 
inherent grasp of the language — dooming me to 
remain suspended in my own muddied sense of self. 

I knew that this fear felt traitorous and undeserved; 

Arabic itself had never made me feel scared, only safe. 
It was the language that wafted through my home, 
perfumed with the wisdom of my grandmother and 
tenderness of my mother. Knowing this helped diffuse 
any trepidation that may have tainted such a meaningful 
part of my life. I convinced myself that praying meant 
trying — it was having faith in the words I didn’t 
know and trusting that they would still be heard and 
understood. Through reconfiguring what prayer meant 
to me, I began to fill the gaps left by language on my 
own; I didn’t know what my hums and recited whispers 
meant, but I knew that they meant something. 

Kneeling at a prayer rug, the language stopped 

feeling foreign. While there was still a gnawing sense 
of yearning for the concealed meaning tucked between 
the unfamiliar words, there was also a whisper of 
satisfaction in the fact that I did know them — that I 
could conjure them with my own breath and make 
them come alive on my tongue. They did not have to be 
inaccessible or arcane; they could still be mine. 

As I’ve gotten older and gained comprehension and 

ability in Arabic through experience, the language 
gap still remains. However, I’ve learned that I can 
fill that language gap the same way I did during my 
daily prayers as an 8-year-old, constructing my own 
meaning from the pieces I’ve collected. I am not yet 
fluent in the Arabic language, but the grasp it has on 
me is unequivocal, inspiring a familiarity that could 
only be felt by someone who has known it their whole 
life and in all their lives past.

Disability in the time of climate crisis

The 
student-organized 

symposium, “Loving Our Planet 
Like We Should Love Each Other: 
Disability in the time of climate crisis” 

took place on March 9. The symposium, 
which offered live captioning and 
American 
Sign 
Language-English 

interpreting 
for 
panelists 
and 

attendees, was organized and hosted 
by the students of the Linguistics 102 
course, shedding light on the resources 
and passions that can be mobilized 
amongst the University of Michigan’s 
student body. Though the focus was 
on the climate crisis, the conversation 
was particularly special in that it was 
mindful of the intersectional effects of 
racism, classism and ableism, and the 
panelists were well-equipped to speak 
on each matter. 

The event opened with a land 

acknowledgement, noting that the 
broadcast took place from unceded 
Anishinaabe territories of Osawa, 
Bodéwadmi 
(Potawatomi) 
and 

Meskwahki-asa-hina (Fox) peoples. 
Additionally, 
the 
event 
was 
in 

memoriam of the many disabled people, 
Black and Indigenous community 
members and people of color who 
have died preventable deaths in the 
disaster that has been the COVID-19 
pandemic and in honor of the students’ 
class member Steven Halland.The 
symposium featured four panelists: 
Rafi Darrow, Izzy Laderman, Teddy 
Dorsette III and Sarah Young Bear-
Brown. 

Rafi explained that their experience 

with chronic migraines while living in 
a fire-prone area, amid climate chaos 
and bad air quality, has limited their 
access to the outside world, and has 
forced them to be strategic about when 
and how to go outside and engage. 
Rafi has set an intention to nurture 
solidarity between the chronically 
ill, neurodivergent, mobility-disabled 
and sensory-disabled communities 
through the Bay Area Disabled 
Dance Collective, of which they are 
a founding member. As well, they 
facilitate informative dialogue about 
disability justice and dance through 

the Sins Invalid Podcast, “Into the Crip 
Universe.”

Izzy, who described her personality 

as one of fairy lights and potted plants, 
spoke to her relationship with Ehlers-
Danlos Syndrome. She attested to the 
fact that many disabled or ill people 
deal with more than just one disability, 
and her experience with Ehlers-
Danlos Syndrome is accompanied 
by over 10 additional diagnoses. Izzy 
has embraced this indubitable pain 
to mobilize a community and is now 
the founder and director of Disability 
Awareness Around the Climate Crisis 
at only 17 years old. Through this 
platform, she informs the public on 
the intersections of disability and the 
climate crisis, as well as sex education. 

Teddy immediately acknowledged 

his being Black and deaf are two 
inseparable identities in his life, as 
they are inseparable for all disabled 
people of color who have been limited 
by society and political authority. 
Like Izzy and Rafi, Teddy has 
dedicated his work to uplifting people 
who have been provided similar 
limitations as he. He is a social justice 
advocate, an entrepreneur and a 
filmmaker. As co-founder of Teddyboy 
Entertainment and Def Lens Media, 
he helps provide resources for others 
to nurture their creative skills and 
realize their dreams. For hard of 
hearing and deaf youth, he established 
Reel Def Entertainment, which is a 
non-profit that helps the youth pursue 
their creative arts interests. He is also 
the communications manager and an 
organizer at Detroit Disability Power.

Sarah is a member of the Fox Tribe of 

the Meskwahki nation in Iowa. Sarah 
is a social justice advocate, a political 
figure and a businesswoman. She has 
been an activist for the Indigenous 
Deaf community since 2014 and 
advocated for the No Dakota Access 
Pipeline organization at Standing Rock 
alongside 20,000 other advocates. 
Sarah has taken her platform into the 
political realm as the Vice-Chair for 
the Native American Caucus for the 
Iowa Democratic Party, and she is the 
founder of Gathering of Deafatives, an 
organization for the Indigenous deaf 
community. And, as a businesswoman, 
she creates and sells beadwork through 
her small business SAYBB Creations 

Beadwork. 

Each panelist is active in their 

respective 
communities, 
fostering 

awareness and creating resources 
for the issues enforced unto them 
and their environments. Community 
activism has long been an essential 
part of safety and survival amid lower-
income and disabled populations. 
This is largely because political and 
authoritative figures have failed to 
address disparities across all aspects of 
life and have often been the root of the 
matter. Though the plights presented to 
the disabled community vary, climate 
chaos is a frequent inhibition for those 
with disabilities when it comes to 
having access to day-to-day pleasures 
or when it comes down to survival. 

It has become apparent that the 

climate crisis serves both as a genesis 
for disability and as a worsening factor 
of pre-existing conditions. Rafi spoke 
to their friends’ experiences with tick-
borne Lyme disease, which they note 
has been on the rise across the country 
and is a result of climate change. Ticks 
would normally be killed off in lower 
temperatures; however, because of 
global warming, ticks now thrive in 
certain areas they didn’t used to inhabit. 
Rafi further explained that this is not 
new information, but that disabled 
people are publicly responding to what 
is happening around us all. Similarly, 
though Izzy’s condition is genetic and 
was not caused by the climate crisis, she 
has many peers whose conditions do 
lead back to the climate. She reiterated 
the necessity of recognizing the 
intersections of environmental racism, 
ableism and classism, noting that the 
people most oppressed by such systems 
often reside in close proximity to toxic 
pipelines, plants and other damaging 
infrastructures and meanwhile have 
less access to medical care. To reiterate 
this, Izzy described her friend, who 
lived near a trash-burning plant and 
had highly active asthma. When this 
woman moved to a middle-class white 
neighborhood, her asthma went away. 
People facing ableist conditions deal 
with more dire impacts of the climate 
crisis because of their proximity to the 
infrastructures causing the climate 
crisis, and because disabled people are 
two times more likely to be in poverty, 
this cyclic proximity to environmental 

danger is inarguably biased against 
their livelihood. 

When 
these 
environmental 

threats are compounded with racism 
and ableism, there is often a lack 
of information distributed to those 
living amid the consequences of 
such systems. Teddy addressed the 
Flint water crisis as an example. He 
reflected on his time as the president 
of Detroit Black Deaf Advocates 
— 
during 
which 
the 
advocates 

sought access to clean water and 
other scarcely provided resources 
— noting that the deaf and disabled 
communities in Flint had less access to 
information and were more drastically 
impacted. Teddy said that people did 
not even know where or how to access 
safe supplies. In this case, deafness 
and Black-ness are simultaneously 
weaponized 
against 
individuals, 

limiting access to survival necessities. 
Sarah added that Indigenous people 
were struggling similarly amid the 
Flint water crisis and that this is not 
new; Indigenous communities across 
the country, such as in the Navajo 
Nation, have been suffering from 
water scarcity for years. Within the 
reservation, Sarah said there are 
100,000 people living in extreme 
poverty without access to clean water, 
which further perpetuates disabilities. 
People have to walk far distances to 
get water bottles, and there are no 
cars, so as illnesses increase, the lack 
of accessibility to medical attention 
factors into an exacerbating death toll.

Rafi affirmed that in their hometown 

of Buffalo, N.Y., communities are 
gravely affected by poor air and water 
quality and that this is an apparent 
trend 
amongst 
majority 
Black, 

Indigenous or otherwise systemically 
oppressed 
communities, 
including 

lower-income populations. They went 
on to reference multiple environmental 
determinants that have caused harm to 
their community such as old factories 
causing asthma and other respiratory 
illnesses. Teddy notes that the impact of 
this air pollution has caused particular 
harm to Black women when considered 
alongside the neglect of Black maternal, 
physical and mental well-being.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
10 — Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
statement

I 

wasn’t surprised when the University of 
Michigan announced a virtual gradua-
tion commencement in February. 

How could I be? After over a year of the 

COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed almost routine 
to keep delaying expectations of normality. 
While COVID-19 cases in Michigan were in a 
lull at the time, given the predicted spikes in 
daily cases around the winter holiday season, 
it was clear that celebrations could result in an 
upward trend. Today, with Michigan seeing 
the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the 
country, it seems risky to host a mega-gradua-
tion ceremony in the Big House. At the time of 
the announcement, however, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel faced considerable back-
lash from the University’s graduating seniors. 

Almost immediately, Public Policy senior 

Tal Lipkin started a petition for an in-person 
graduation ceremony. The petition currently 
has over 5,800 signatures from seniors, parents 
and alumni. In the weeks following, it was hard 
to ignore the blue signs adorned with “HONK 
to support UMich Class of 2021 IN-PERSON, 
SAFE OPT-IN Grad Ceremony” placed 
around campus. 

“I deserve a graduation,” LSA senior Riley 

McMahon publicly commented on the peti-
tion two months ago. 

On March 15, Lipkin updated the petition 

with a call to action. She urged parents and 
students to call and email Schlissel and the 
University’s Board of Regents all day to push 
for a compromise. Eventually, their efforts did 
partially pay off. On March 25, Schlissel an-
nounced the opening of Michigan Stadium for 
a live viewing of the virtual graduation com-
mencement. 

Even so, it’s hard to ignore the disappoint-

ment of the class of 2021. We were the only 
year to miss out on the end of junior and se-
nior year, a time usually marked by milestones 
and celebrations. On top of that, job prospects 
look bleak — the U.S. unemployment rate is at 
6.0%, which is still 2.5% higher than the pre-
pandemic levels of February 2020. Enrollment 
in post-graduate programs increased signifi-
cantly last year: Medical schools saw an 18% 
increase and law schools saw a whopping 32% 
increase for the 2020-2021 application cycle. 
Many graduates see more schooling as their 
only option in a sparse job market. 

Yet, as warmer weather washes over Ann 

Arbor, the city is teeming with life. I see cap and 
gown-clad students every time I pass through 
Law Quadrangle. Student photographers are 
still advertising their rates on social media plat-
forms, and nearly all my friends have someone 
taking pictures for them. Despite the disap-
pointments, the class of 2021 isn’t shying away 
from graduation celebrations. 

So, how do seniors really feel about gradu-

ating during a pandemic? 

A subdued graduation 

“I actually don’t even know what day grad-

uation is,” Sarah Minnis confessed to me in a 
Zoom interview with a laugh.

Minnis is a first-generation college student 

and a LSA senior majoring in Biopsychol-
ogy, Cognition, and Neuroscience. While she’s 
proud to be the first of her family to graduate in 
May, Minnis doesn’t put too much stake in the 
ceremony itself. 

“I know that I’m getting my degree and 

I know I worked hard. I don’t need a crowd 
watching me,” Minnis told me. “It’s important 
that I’m the first person in my family. But it’s 
the act of going through school and completing 
the degree. It’s not the graduation ceremony 
itself that’s important.”

As I talked to more graduating seniors, I re-

alized that this viewpoint wasn’t unique. 

“I’m not super bummed about this whole 

literal graduation,” Timmy Li, a LSA senior ma-
joring in Biomolecular Science, said in a Zoom 
interview. “Graduating is not the biggest deal to 
me. It’s more about ending senior year overall.” 

I found myself in agreement with Min-

nis and Li. I’ve never been one to seek out the 
limelight, and the thought of random strangers 
clapping for me always felt strange. Perhaps I 
had set my expectations low — ever since the 
start of the pandemic, I had never thought 
an in-person commencement would be pos-
sible. So when virtual commencement was an-
nounced, I didn’t feel let down. 

On top of that, many degree programs are 

having their own virtual graduation ceremo-
nies apart from the main commencement. The 
Ross School of Business is holding a student-
only event on April 29, commencement on 
April 30 and a separate name-reading cer-
emony as well. The School of Nursing is film-
ing their graduates walking and receiving a di-
ploma in person, and then streaming the video 
during their virtual commencement. 

The University’s LSA Program in Biology, 

the umbrella branch that my Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology major falls under, asked their 
graduates for pictures and contributions to be 
compiled into a short video. It’s not much, but 
there are ways to personalize the graduation 
experience without a live commencement. 

But I have a clear bias. I’ll be attending 

medical school in July, and that feels like a 
bigger cause for celebration than my under-
graduate graduation. I’ve already equated my 
white coat ceremony, which marks the start of 
a medical career, as my pseudo undergraduate 
graduation. Close one chapter, start another. In 
my mind, it kills two birds with one stone. 

However, not everyone is planning on 

more school immediately after graduation, or 
at all. For many, this Winter 2021 commence-
ment can symbolize the end of being a student, 
at least for a while. While some are excited 
about the prospect of a job, others feel differ-
ently. 

“Once you’re done with school, you lose 

structure,” Li told me. “I’d rather have that 
school stress and know that college is happen-
ing. In that sense, I don’t want to graduate.”

I’ve found that the disappointment of grad-

uating seniors may not surround the physical 
commencement, but rather a sense of lost op-
portunities and experiences. How do we find 
ways to celebrate graduation so we actually feel 
like we’re graduating?

Closure in an unusual Ann Arbor
Graduation often implies a sense of closure. 

Graduates want a chance to see their friends, 
visit their favorite bars one last time, round out 
their summer with a trip around the world. I 
know I do. 

I think of closure as a well-rounded end-

ing, a way to mark the end of a life chapter. 
Without it, leaving your college town, a home 
away from home, can seem abrupt and sudden. 
Completing our last classes, saying goodbyes to 
friends and experiencing our last moments in 
Ann Arbor are all ways that we create endings 
for ourselves. 

For the class of 2021, finding closure in 

Ann Arbor is less celebratory than usual. Most 
undergraduate classes have been taught on-
line this winter. Most graduating seniors’ last 
class will be over Zoom, a weak substitute for 
a bustling lecture hall. Michigan restaurants 
and bars must operate at 50% capacity for in-
door dining and close before 11 p.m., per Gov. 
Whitmer’s March 5 executive order. For those 
comfortable venturing out, it won’t be quite 
the bar-hopping adventure we expected. And 
many seniors may not feel safe doing this at all 
— the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion still defines indoor dining as a high-risk 
activity.

“The real thing I’m disappointed about is 

that the pandemic affected our senior year,” Li 
told me. 

Li was upset that he wouldn’t be able to 

celebrate his last weeks in Ann Arbor with his 
friends. 

“We want to do some fun things we haven’t 

done before, but it’s hard with all these rules 
and restrictions. It feels like everything is 
closed or closes early,” Li said.

Rachel Quigley, a School of Nursing senior, 

agreed with Li.

“I’m sad that I’m missing out on a normal 

commencement, going to bars and just doing 
stuff that seniors do,” Quigley said in a Zoom 
interview. “It’s not the same and it makes me 
feel like we got cheated out of a huge part of 
our lives.”

We often hear that our college years are the 

best of our lives. In this light, Quigley’s feeling 
of being “cheated out” of a significant experi-
ence makes sense, especially at the University 
of Michigan. The dominant narrative about the 
University is one of pride and school spirit. In 
my early years of college, upperclassmen often 
told me that Ann Arbor was a “magical” city. I 
vividly remember taking a late-night Uber two 
years ago with a close friend who at the time 
was set to graduate in a month.

“Enjoy every minute of it,” she told me. 

“The years will fly by before you know it.”

Yet, Ann Arbor rarely felt magical for me. 

I struggled to find a community in such a large 
student body my first two years of college. 
Once I felt like I’d finally found my place at the 
University, the pandemic hit and classes went 
online soon after. I had less than a year of liv-
ing in an Ann Arbor I loved and enjoyed before 
everything looked different. I do love this little 
town, but I’m also ready to move on and start 
fresh in a different part of the world. 

I’ve always found it hard to establish myself 

in a city that I’ll eventually leave. I know the 
next few years of my life will be spent moving 
from city to city, never quite settling down in 
one place before moving on to the next. Ann 
Arbor sometimes felt transitory for me, a tem-
porary place to live before I moved somewhere 
else. When the city’s landscape changed with 
closures and restrictions, it made it even harder 
to solidify any connection I had before I gradu-
ated. 

For some graduates, a changed Ann Arbor 

can be disappointing. But others disagree. Min-
nis told me that she’d always had to keep a job 
in college to pay bills. Ann Arbor doesn’t look 
very different for her. 

“Ann Arbor is the same for me. I go to 

school during the week and go to my job on the 
weekend,” Minnis said. 

Creating a satisfactory ending in Ann Ar-

bor is difficult enough for the class of 2021, but 
closure isn’t always synonymous with a geo-
graphical location. 

Samantha Kao graduated from the School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance in Fall 2020 with 
a degree in multidisciplinary studies and a 
concentration in piano. Kao was disappointed 
with the University’s fall graduation activities, 
which consisted of videos and social media 
posts. 

“It felt very anticlimactic,” Kao told me 

over Zoom. “I had a cocktail of feelings. I felt 
scared, disappointed, left out.”

Kao expressed frustration with SMTD’s 

response to the pandemic last summer. She 
wasn’t able to access the School of Music build-
ing or its practice rooms until late August. In-
sistent on doing a senior recital, Kao managed 
to get an electric keyboard from one of her 
friends and do a video recording of her perfor-
mance. But compared to a live piano recital, a 
recording on an electric keyboard was a poor 
substitute. 

“I had all these plans to fulfill and round out 

my music career … and it just didn’t happen,” 
Kao said. 

Kao’s sense of closure came less from Ann 

Arbor and more from a sense of lost musical 
opportunities, a problem that many music and 
art graduates are facing across the country. 

Kao has since been taking a break from 

school and searching for jobs. After suffering 
from severe tendonitis that affected her piano 

playing, she isn’t sure where to turn next. For 
Kao, an atypical graduation celebration felt like 
adding insult to injury. 

“I felt like it wasn’t much (for others), but 

for me, it was a lot,” Kao said.

Downplaying achievements 

The U.S. has suffered over 500,000 deaths 

from the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of 
Michigan has a death toll of over 17,000. In this 
climate, celebrating anything can seem cruel 
and out of touch. I feel the need to keep my 
celebrations private and mellow. Eating a meal 
outside, spending time with my family, saying 
my goodbyes to Ann Arbor — that feels like the 
type of celebration I deserve. 

At the same time, graduating from the 

University of Michigan does feel like a large 
accomplishment. As one of the country’s top 
public schools with a 23% acceptance rate, 
graduating from this university is something 
to be proud of. Growing up in Metro Detroit, 
the University was often branded as the school 
to attend, so much so that I barely thought 
twice before accepting my admissions offer. It 
seemed like the natural thing to do. 

Graduating in the middle of a pandemic 

means reconciling your achievements with the 
current social climate. Celebrate, but not too 
much. Keep your celebrations private, but still 
enjoy your time with close family and friends. 
Don’t rub salt in the wounds of those suffering. 
This mind game can be exhausting for gradu-
ating seniors who feel like they deserve more 
recognition. 

After graduating, Kao struggled with this 

same feeling. Kao managed to graduate a se-
mester early after changing her major a few 
times. She told me that she was dealing with 
personal issues at the time but still worked 
hard to keep her grades up and save on an ex-
tra semester of tuition. Instead of a celebration, 
she turned to a search for jobs, which seemed 
like an abrupt end to her school years. 

“I was really proud of myself but felt like I 

didn’t have a way to celebrate that,” Kao said. 
“The most celebratory thing I did was I got a 
tiramisu from Costco and ate it with my room-
mates.”

This feeling of invisibility is common for 

those graduating during a global crisis. Mi-
chelle Obama addressed this in her virtual 
commencement speech to 2020 graduates last 
year. 

“For those of you who feel invisible: Please 

know that your story matters. Your ideas mat-
ter. Your experiences matter. Your vision for 
what our world can and should be matters,” 
Obama said. 

Gaby Aguirre, an international student 

from Ecuador graduating from the Business 
School in May, understands this sentiment. 
However, Aguirre is trying her best to stay 
positive and appreciate her accomplishments 
in her own way. 

“It has been my dream to graduate from a 

U.S. college since I was in high school,” Aguirre 
told me over Zoom. “Just the idea of being able 
to go outside and take my pictures with a cap 
and gown from the University of Michigan is 
enough for me.”

After four years, Aguirre still finds it hard 

to believe that she is attending a U.S. univer-
sity and one of the top business schools in the 
country. Aguirre’s parents worked hard to get 
her where she is today, and her family plans on 
flying to Michigan in a few weeks to celebrate 
together. Aguirre is grateful for that.

“(International students) don’t take gradu-

ation from a U.S. college as granted,” Aguirre 
said. “Sometimes when I talk to classmates, I 
wish they would appreciate it better.”

Aguirre insists that there are ways to cel-

ebrate graduation this year without disregard-
ing one’sachievements. She points to social 
media as a way to spread the news and boost 
confidence for graduates. 

“Of course it would be more emotional to 

go in and walk and be there,” Aguirre said. “But 
it’s still a huge achievement for all of us. So I 
think I’m just happy and excited.”

Celebrations in a pandemic 

We may have a mostly virtual commence-

ment, but that isn’t stopping us from celebrat-
ing graduation. 

Several students I spoke to had made ar-

rangements for family day trips to Ann Arbor 
to celebrate on a smaller scale. Ann Arbor res-
taurants are already filling their reservations 
for graduation weekend. Popular Italian joint 
Mani Osteria has opened a waitlist for outdoor 
seating, The Earle has created a special menu 
for celebrating families, and reservations at 
Asian restaurant Pacific Rim are going fast. 

Aguirre looks forward to celebrating her 

achievement with her family. She doesn’t mind 
that her celebration will be more intimate 
without the crowd at the Big House. 

“If you want the real feeling of making 

someone proud, you can just look at your par-
ents’ eyes. And that’s it, you know?” Aguirre 
said. 

Aguirre’s family plans to watch the vir-

tual commencement in their hotel room while 
Aguirre views it at the Big House. Afterward, 
they’ll leave for a road trip around Michigan. 
Aguirre looks forward to celebrating with a 
mini-vacation while still following COVID 
safety protocols. 

“They’re making my graduation an excuse 

to travel,” Aguirre told me with a laugh. 

Other seniors are trying their hand at small 

gatherings with just their close friends and 
family. Quigley plans to throw a small cer-
emony at her house in Ann Arbor, as all her 
roommates and their families are vaccinated 
already. 

“We’re going to have food catered to our 

house and have our own mini graduation,” 
Quigley said. “We’re all going to give a speech 
too.”

Kao is also waiting until her friends get 

vaccinated to hold her outdoor graduation cel-
ebration.

“I’m super close to feeling comfortable be-

ing around more people than my bubble,” Kao 
told me. “I think that would be the closure that 
I would have wanted.” 

Regardless of celebrations, nearly everyone 

I spoke to wanted to soak in the city of Ann 
Arbor before they moved out. Many students 
took advantage of remote learning as a chance 
to leave their apartment and explore different 
parts of Michigan as well. 

“It opened the door for me to do different 

activities that I don’t normally do,” Aguirre 
said. “We’ll drive up to Port Huron, or play 
sand volleyball in Elbel field, or go study in a 
coffee shop. In my four years, I had never gone 
to a coffee shop to study.”

I’ve been trying to do the same. I go for a 

hike in Ann Arbor’s parks a couple of times a 
week, usually in the middle of a workday to 
avoid the crowd. I stash my phone deep in my 
drawstring bag and hike in silence through 
Barton Nature Center, Bird Hills Nature Area, 
remote parts of Nichols Arboretum. It feels like 
closure for me — a way to say a private, silent 
goodbye to the city I’ve called home the last 
four years. 

I’ll be leaving my Ann Arbor studio apart-

ment at the end of April to make space for my 
summer subletter. Two weeks before com-
mencement, my parents have asked me if I 
have a plan for graduation at least five times. 
Truthfully, I still don’t know. If this year has 
taught me anything, agendas and itineraries 
are meaningless. I’m tired of making them. 

At the end of the day, I have no idea how 

to feel about graduating during such an uncon-
ventional year. But I’m okay with waiting until 
May 1 to find out. For now, I think I’ll go where 
the wind takes me, drift in this city until I no 
longer can. Breathe it in before packing up for 
my next adventure.

Another year, another pandemic graduation

raduation looms on the horizon. For 
every college student, the idea of gradu-
ating college holds a bittersweet flavor, 

caught between the satisfaction of accomplish-
ment and the sadness of goodbyes. For some, it 
holds more of one than the other. It is sometimes 
hard to tell which is stronger. Sometimes, the 
bitterness wins. 

At 21 years old, I’ve been a college student 

for five years and have been at the University of 
Michigan for three of them. I took courses at a 
community college for two years in my child-
hood state of California before transferring to 
the University. My mom encouraged me to ap-
ply since her and my stepfather’s resident sta-
tus would transfer to me. One acceptance letter 
and months later, I was living much closer to 
my mom and my sister Sydney’s family, which 
I liked because I could visit them any time I 
wanted. 

I look back on the clueless 18-year-old from 

the middle of nowhere in Northern California, 
who was overwhelmed by the University’s size 
and the sheer number of people during her first 
few weeks of class. I remember how excited she 
was to wake up to snow on the ground. That girl 
could never have imagined that her path would 
bring her this far or to this particular place. That 
her senior year would be spent shut away in an 
apartment off-campus. That by now she would 
have accomplished and lost so much. 

It was only three weeks into this winter se-

mester that I received a phone call from my sister 
that our mom had passed away. She lived only 25 
minutes away from me, but I hadn’t risked hug-
ging her in over a month because of the risk of 
coronavirus contagion. She lived alone, having 
separated from my stepfather a couple of years 
ago. The only hint I got that something was 
wrong was that she wasn’t responding to my 
texts. I didn’t know she was gone until almost 24 
hours after it happened. She was only 57 years 
old. 

Her funeral was simple. We wore masks and 

social distanced. We ordered a bouquet of flow-
ers in her favorite color, purple, looking as much 
like a bouquet of wildflowers she would have 

picked herself as we could make it. I played her 
favorite music and put together a long slideshow 
of photos of her, even though she never liked 
having her picture taken. We felt we needed 
some event to celebrate her life, to mark the fact 
that she was gone even though we couldn’t be-
lieve it, couldn’t accept it. Closure was the idea, 
but we felt and still feel no closure. 

I mark every accomplishment now in my 

mind on a calendar of months since she was 
alive. My first column in The Michigan Daily 
this semester was spread out on her coffee table 
when we went to her house to begin packing 
her things. She had said she planned to frame it. 
Since then, I published my first article in a non-
student publication and I won a Hopwood Un-
dergraduate Nonfiction Award: the outcome of 
efforts she witnessed but of which never got to 
see the rewards. On the one hand, I can’t imag-
ine having done any more or better in my under-
graduate career. 

But on the other side of that, I thought that 

I would be taking graduation pictures with her 
now. She would be telling me how proud of me 
she was. 

I still haven’t taken any graduation pictures. 
This chapter has a bitter ending for a lot of 

people, with not a lot of closure. I know this is 
not the senior year any of us imagined, distanced 
from friends and family and normal life. I know 
the loss that millions of people are experiencing 
from losing their family members and friends to 
this deadly pandemic. 

I know I did not imagine having to lose my 

mom so soon nor not being able to say goodbye. 
I pushed through to graduation because I knew 
she would want me to. But the bitter, bone-deep 
ache of loss is much more powerful than any 
shallow closure I feel from finishing my under-
graduate studies. That’s something I’ve been 
grappling with a lot. 

It’s natural to ask, “What if?” What if I had 

taken a different course that semester, or had 
done a different program or a different intern-
ship? What if this pandemic hadn’t happened 
and I’d had a normal senior year? What if my 
mom was still here? These questions have no an-

swers. We’ll never know what might have been. 

The word “closure” seems to refer to the con-

cept of a definitive conclusion. With it comes a 
sense of acceptance. Oh, sweet closure. There 
is an implication of tying up loose ends, of un-
derstanding what happened and why. It’s what 
happens at the end of fiction books. You turn 
to the last page, you read the last lines, you see 
the words “the end” printed on paper. You shut 
the book and you feel satisfied. Everything hap-
pened for a reason and everything had its own 
meaning. 

But whether closure is ever achievable in 

an ever-changing world where nothing can be 
controlled or predicted, I don’t know. We work 
and sometimes we succeed at the goals we set, 
but do we ever feel that we have reached a con-
clusion? 

Real-life is messy. Real-life doesn’t tie up 

loose ends, or always offer a chance for goodbye. 
We don’t know the reason that things happen or 
what they mean. We have ideas, but no explana-
tions upon which we agree. 
M

y mom brought me into the world 
and raised me. She taught me to be 
passionate and to fight for what I 

care about — the environment, animals, people 
— and encouraged me to utilize my strengths to 
those ends, to follow my dreams. She took me 
traveling and showed me to love the world and 
all of the adventures it holds. She encouraged me 
to apply to the University and she’s the reason I 
studied environmental studies. Her encourage-
ment is why I write. In many ways, her dreams 
for a better world live on in me.

The truth is, I didn’t come to the University 

for the graduation ceremony. I came for the 
years spent hunched uncomfortably over my 
desk struggling to learn and write and grow. You 
didn’t love someone just to go to their funeral. 
You loved them for the impact they made upon 
you. 

At the end of this long, hard year, and stand-

ing at the crossroads of pathways into the future, 
it is okay not to feel closure because this is not 
the final page. There is too much left to do in this 
world to feel that way.

Saying the G word

W

alking through the Law Quadrangle 
and waiting for my photographer, I 
couldn’t help but notice them: the 

group of girls doing their graduation photoshoot 
at the same time, clad in white dresses, caps and 
gowns. I, too, had purchased a white dress and a 
new pair of heels for the occasion, but there was 
a key difference: I was alone.

I booked the session in January with a pho-

tographer I knew. We booked my session for the 
first week of April. Then came the question that 
made my stomach lurch: “How many people?”

Long before it was time to book, I knew what 

was coming. Girls at the University of Michi-
gan don’t take their graduation photos alone. 
The more girlfriends surrounding you in pastel 
dresses and nude pumps, the better. And taking 
my photos alone felt pathetic, like I was send-
ing a message to the world that I didn’t have any 
friends.

I didn’t have a choice. The friends I had 

made at this school had largely graduated, in-
cluding my boyfriend, a member of the class 
of 2019 with whom I’ve been long-distance for 
nearly two years. Others were younger than me 
or doing their photos with others. The women 
I consider my closest friends all go to different 
universities.

So, that Friday afternoon in the Law Quad, I 

set aside my embarrassment and took the pho-
tos. A few days later, I plastered them over so-
cial media, captioning them with an ironic song 
lyric from Taylor Swift’s Daylight: “Maybe I’ve 
stormed out of every single room in this town.”

That’s the duality of being that person who’s 

wanted to graduate for two-and-a-half years. My 
grad photos embarrassed me, yes, but I still felt 
the need to display them and tell everyone I was 
graduating. 

Finally, I was less than a month from getting 

out of here.

***
There are a lot of clichés I heard entering col-

lege and starting as a sports writer at The Michi-
gan Daily: “The best four years of your life!” or, 
“The best job you’ll ever have!” I hadn’t liked 
high school much, so these phrases assured me 
that college would be better. Michigan is huge, I 
thought; here, I’d find my people.

Spoiler alert: I didn’t.
It’s been four years and while I have a few 

close friends, I never found a place where I felt 
I truly fit in. I wasn’t necessarily hated, but I 
wasn’t liked, either. Most times, I felt, I was just 
there. 

During my freshman year in South Quad 

Residence Hall, all the girls in my hall were join-
ing sororities and studying for organic chemistry, 
while I stayed far away from STEM and spent 
my weekends at field hockey games. Freshman 
year, the one year I attended football games as a 
fan, I went to every game alone because most of 

the people I knew only cared about the tailgates. 
Then, between sophomore and junior years, I fell 
out with three people I considered close friends 
in the span of eight months. As I posted on Insta-
gram about all the basketball games I’d covered, 
I spent many late nights crying in my single resi-
dence hall room.

I was alone.
I tried to run from my status as a lonely girl. 

I stopped posting much on my Instagram, only 
showing photos of games I covered or places 
I visited. Deep down inside, I constantly won-
dered if it was too late for me, or if I’d ever find a 
space where I was truly wanted.

When the pandemic hit and took away the 

majority of things I was looking forward to in 
2020 — summer in Washington D.C., my sister’s 
high school graduation, a football trip to Seattle 
— I began clinging to graduation even more than 
I had been before. Without anything in person, 
suddenly, the clock had run out on chances to 
join new clubs or meet new people. Following 
COVID-19 restrictions was easy for me because 
there was barely anyone in Ann Arbor I regularly 
saw anyway. Every new restriction was just a fur-
ther reminder that nothing had changed for me 
and nothing would: I was still alone, and I would 
continue to be. This time, it was just government-
mandated.

The one thing I knew I still had going for 

me was that with each passing day, graduation 
ticked closer and closer. I counted down the 
months until I could get out of here, get a real 
job, go somewhere I wasn’t constantly reminded 
of my loneliness.

I never had a lot of spending money in col-

lege. I turned down getting food with people be-
cause I was so budget-conscious. And yet, I went 
all out for graduation in a way I hadn’t for any-
thing before. Dress. Heels. A haircut. Makeup. 
Regalia. Photos. I spent hundreds of dollars on 
the occasion. Sometimes I questioned why I was 
even doing it. Did I really need grad photos? Did 
I need a new dress when I didn’t even wear the 
dresses I already had because I never got invited 
to the right occasions? 

But I decided to go forward with the purchas-

es because, after four years of feeling like I wasn’t 
enough and could never be enough for anyone, I 
needed something to feel good about. At least I 
liked the way I looked. At least the photos were 
a tangible reminder that I was so close to getting 
out of here.
I

t was just my luck that the pandemic forced 
graduation online. There was nothing I 
wanted more than to graduate in Michigan 

Stadium, with my loving family and boyfriend 
beside me. At graduation, I would be celebrated.

It’s even more ironic that the University de-

cided to allow graduates into Michigan Stadium 
to watch the virtual commencement, but just the 
students. No family. No friends. I knew from the 

moment they announced it that I wanted to go, 
but it wasn’t lost on me that I’d be finishing col-
lege as I spent it: alone.

***
Every December, The Daily lets its graduat-

ing seniors write goodbye columns. I’d read pre-
vious ones, and they made me cry. Not because 
they were sentimental, but because they were 
largely filled with seniors reminiscing on the 
number of friends they’d made and how they’d 
never have a job as good as this. Who has it better 
than us, after all? 

For me, it seemed like the answer to that 

question was everyone but me.

The Daily sent me a lot of places and gave me 

a lot of opportunities. But I never found a home 
there in the way everyone always talked about, 
and if it’s the best job I’ll ever have, I’d leave the 
journalism industry tomorrow.

So I summed it up in 800 words: how it feels 

to want to leave a space where everyone is beg-
ging for extra time, how to sit there wondering if 
it will ever be worth it. I wrote about being alone. 
That was when the direct messages started to 
flow in.

I got multiple messages that day from people 

who’d graduated before me, people I looked up 
to, telling me that my experience wasn’t unique. 
They’d been in my shoes before. They were glad 
I’d spoken my truth.

For once, I wasn’t alone.
“We don’t say the G word here,” one of my 

professors said while we were discussing com-
mencement plans last week. It was another ex-
ample of the cliche that nobody graduating col-
lege wants to come to terms with leaving.

But I say it. I fixate on it. It’s the one thing in 

my life I can hold tight to with everything I have. 
And I’m not the only one — it’s just that those of 
us with graduation circled on our calendars for 
months or years tend to stay in the shadows.

I know this because I was finally willing to 

open up. I was willing to write about my experi-
ence, I was willing to do my grad photos alone. 
Only then did I realize how many shared my ex-
perience.

When I finally toss my cap up in the air, the 

moment I’ve anticipated for years, it’ll be dedi-
cated to everyone who didn’t have the experi-
ence they wanted in college. For people like us, 
this is an accomplishment, a door opening to a 
fresh start and a life we get to make.

Knowing that, I don’t think taking pictures 

alone should be embarrassing. It should be a sign 
of resilience and of reclaiming the narrative.

It’s a constant reminder that while all good 

things come to an end, all bad things — wheth-
er that be a suboptimal college experience or 
a pandemic that torpedoed a senior year — do 
too.

In a few weeks, it will all be over, and no one 

can take that away from me.

A

s someone who was born and raised 
in Ann Arbor, people always ask, “Do 
you regret staying home for college?”

Maybe they are shocked that I would elect 

to live so close to my parents, high school 
friends or the familiar streets of my child-
hood. Maybe they aren’t surprised at all, 
picturing every Ann Arborite as born with 
maize-and-blue streaks in their hair, proph-
esied as a future Wolverine. Maybe they envi-
sion college as the time to leave the nest, and 
that true growth comes from the discomfort 
of change.

In reality, when I stepped onto campus in 

2017, I was happy to be close to my parents. I 
made it a point to meet new people and it was 
then that I went to my first ever Michigan 
football game. So while I didn’t quite leave 
the nest by coming to the University of Michi-
gan, my experiences here have taught me that 
you can still grow even if you physically stay 
in the same place.

Consider this: A brown building with grey 

scaffolding and green ivies slithering up 
its side. If I told you only of this image, you 
might be picturing many different locations, 
and most likely, none would evoke deep feel-
ings of community, stress, inspiration or love. 
You’d just be imagining a building. But if I 
asked you to consider the Hatcher Graduate 
Library, with its quiet marble steps and a lab-
yrinth of stacks; or the Law Quadrangle, with 
the daunting gaze of stained glass over sun-
bathing students; or even the Shapiro Under-
graduate Library, with its suspicious smells 
and people taking phone calls in the stairwell, 
then they become more than places or struc-
tures. They become breathing, living things, 
full of memories and relationships and emo-
tions because it’s not the places that shape us, 
it’s the people and experiences inside of them 
that do.

I didn’t grow any more or less because I 

stayed in Ann Arbor, I just grew in different 
ways. It’s a theme that I’ve explored more 
and more as my senior year at the Univer-
sity comes to a close: Who would I be if I 
made different decisions? If I could go back, 
would I have done things the same? What 
are my regrets? For a while, I lamented over 
the classes I took or didn’t take, the places 
I lived, the programs I applied to. I thought 
about the times I stayed in instead of going 
out, the sports games I never attended, the 
friendships I turned away from and the ones 
I maintained. In those moments of intense 
introspection and regret, I have felt the urge 
to reach out to the younger people in my life, 

to help them avoid the mistakes I made, to 
curate their college lives into the most fun, 
diverse and educational experience possible.

But while the media might try to tell us 

differently, there is no formula for a perfect 
college experience. It arguably does not exist 
at all. There is only your college experience, 
and assigning it objective values of success — 
like if you had a close-knit group of friends, 
met the love of your life or got a prestigious 
internship — or values of failure — like if you 
didn’t get honors, had trouble finding your 
people or spent a semester depressed — will 
leave you permanently unfulfilled, suspended 
in air, reaching for the preconceived notions 
and examples that would validate your expe-
rience. Indeed, if you spend all of college 
trying to curate the “best four years of your 
life,” you will only end up relying on other 
people and their experiences as indicators 
of the merit of your own. And the best way 
to go through college is in your own organic, 
unique and personal way.

I’m reminded of a piece I wrote at the end 

of my freshman year when I was a columnist 
for The Michigan Daily’s Opinion section. 
When I pulled up the old document to com-
pare it to this one, I found myself laughing 
endearingly, if not a little critically, at the 
memory of myself at the time, a self reflected 
in that prose. I was 18 years old and freshly 
heartbroken; I didn’t have many friends nor 
plans for the summer. That anxiety, sadness 
and resentment are palpable in my words: “A 
lesson I’ve learned in college is that vulner-
ability usually comes with hurt. To show real 
emotion, to allow yourself that honesty, will 
lead to pain.” And while in that column I ulti-
mately argue that being vulnerable is what 
gives life its meaning, the passage communi-
cates a loss of innocence, an introduction into 
adulthood. 

That’s a big part of college, one that is dis-

cussed less than the more tangible introduc-
tions to adulthood, like cooking for yourself 
or paying your own bills. To be sure, not all of 
us arrive at college with bright-eyed naivety 
and idealism, but for many, this campus is 
where we experience our first blows of lone-
liness, betrayal and insecurity. It’s where we 
start realizing the uglier aspects of the world 
and humanity, adjusting and maturing in the 
process. 
A

nd yet, college is also where we often 
experience the euphoria of an awak-
ened mind and stimulating course-

work, feel first love and touch or meet the 
people who inspire and shape us. It’s where 

you can walk into any classroom and almost 
hear the humming of eager minds at work, 
enter a campus bar and be met with sticky, 
tipsy smiles or just simply be studying for 
class when you realize, Whoa, this is my pas-
sion, this gives me life. 

This dichotomy of highs and lows is one 

I began understanding even in my first few 
months at Michigan, and I wrote about it in 
the same freshman-year column: “I often 
experienced isolation and togetherness within 
the same day. I felt impassioned in one class 
and resigned in another. I balanced finding 
myself with finding someone for me.” Indeed, 
at an age and in a setting that is so unpredict-
able, so charged with energy and hormones 
and curiosity, we never quite know what we 
want, what we’ll feel, what we should do.

To me, though, that’s the beauty of col-

lege, and one of the things I’ve enjoyed the 
most during my time at the University. With 
so many opportunities and people, each new 
experience has been like the tap of a tiny chis-
el, each one slowly shaping me into the per-
son I am today as I type at my desk, my cap 
and gown hanging proudly next to me. Some 
of those taps are gentle, leaving a smooth, soft 
finish. Some of those taps are painful; they 
break off too much, stinging even in memory. 
But what I’ve learned is to not scrutinize the 
small cracks in the sculpture, but to rather 
step back and appreciate the art as a whole.

Of course, this is easier said than done. I 

have by no means reached the pinnacle of 
maturity and understanding when it comes to 
college or even adulthood. I’m still often reck-
less with the chisel, and at times I have trouble 
seeing the value in the blemishes that have 
inevitably occurred over the last four years. I 
can also imagine that one day I will look back 
on this column, just as I did with my freshman 
year one, and chuckle at how little I had yet to 
discover, how much I claimed to understand 
with these words. 

But that’s exactly what growth is, and just 

as I used writing to understand the passage 
from childhood to adulthood back in freshman 
year, I am using it now to try to put words to 
the feeling I get when someone asks me, “Do 
you regret?” I can now confidently respond 
with a no, because I find it a privilege to have 
had these four years at the University of Mich-
igan, and I am grateful for every little imprint 
it has left on me, from the classes that added 
layers to how I see the world, to the nights I 
scream-cried in the shower and all the way to 
this newspaper, that let me, in streaming, cha-
otic sentences, write about it all.

Lost at Michigan: a reflection of my 
transition from rural to university life

O

n the evening of Wednesday, 
Dec. 16, 2016, I lounged in my 
old bedroom, exhausted from a 

particularly grueling competitive cheer 
practice, mindlessly scrolling through 
my phone after yet another day of going 
through the motions. Just after 8 p.m., I 
refreshed my Gmail, only expecting to 
delete more emails from various stores 
— hello, Victoria’s Secret and Forever21 
— who flooded my inbox with promo-
tions each day. Then, suddenly, there 
it was. An email with the subject line: 
“Your University of Michigan Admis-
sions Decision.” Without even opening 
the email, I glanced at the first few words, 
written just under the subject line, that 
read: “CONGRATULATIONS Elayna — 
You’re IN!” 

Startled and in utter shock, I jumped 

out of bed, sprinted out of my room and 
down the stairs to the living room — slip-
ping multiple times in my socks on our 
wood floors — and ran up to my older 
sister. Wordlessly, I shoved my phone in 
her face as I stood in front of her, speech-
less and in tears, attempting to catch my 
breath. My parents looked at us in bewil-
derment, wondering what could possibly 
be on that phone screen. My sister, real-
izing I was at a loss for words, filled them 
in: “She got in!”

I got in. 
I was quite apathetic throughout the 

entire college application process. My 
sister had matriculated to the University 
as well, but generally, attending a large, 
four-year university was an exception to 
the rule in our little 2,000-person home-
town. For the most part, members of our 
tiny graduating classes found themselves 
attending local community colleges or 
small state schools, going to trade school 
or entering full-time work on fam-
ily farms, in factories or local real estate. 
Many would stay in the town, or at least 
the county, for the rest of their lives, find-
ing success and happiness in their homes, 
families and work. 

The academics at our high school were 

tailored for this. A squat, one-story build-
ing shaped like a square with two small 
wings, Bronson Jr./Sr. High School did 
its very best to breed success for its stu-
dents. Housing grades six through 12, 
with a generous estimate of 475 total stu-
dents, the school was chronically under-
funded. Our textbooks dated back to the 
early ‘90s and monstrous box televisions 
still hung from the ceilings in the corner 
of the classrooms, most of which still had 
chalkboards. We didn’t have any official 

International Baccalaureate or Advanced 
Placement programs; our sole AP class 
— AP U.S. History — couldn’t even be 
listed as an AP course on our transcripts, 
reputedly due to financial reasons, and 
we didn’t have calculus or biochemistry 
either. Seniors spent half the year taking 
a class on U.S. government and the other 
taking what was meant to be economics, 
but our teacher chose to focus on person-
al finance instead. This was a reasonable 
choice given that these skills are much 
more practical — therefore more likely 
to be used by most students after gradua-
tion — as compared to a high school-level 
understanding of macroeconomic con-
cepts. 

Many of my friends and family mem-

bers, along with my entire community 
back in Bronson, found happiness and 
success by utilizing this education, find-
ing work that they enjoyed and that 
allowed them to support their families. 
They not only embrace but thrive in their 
small-town, humble lifestyles, building 
friendships and tight-knit community 
bonds that last for generations. My com-
munity loves living in a place that feels 
familiar and intimate — where everybody 
literally knows everybody.

But, deep down, I always knew the 

small-town life wasn’t meant for me. I 
wanted to do something more. I didn’t 
know what “more” was, but I knew I 
had the potential to do it, and I knew I 
couldn’t find it in Bronson, Mich. 

This has always been a source of guilt — 

the idea that the lives my family and com-
munity members lived somehow weren’t 
good enough for me. After announcing 
that I would be attending the University, 
I knew some members of the community 
would immediately label me as preten-
tious and arrogant — but it wasn’t about 
them. They found their own versions of 
success, and I am immensely proud of 
them for that. But my imagination was 
big, my desire to learn was bigger, and 
my feelings of being trapped inside such 
a small box were suffocating.

As I started to think about attending 

college, I had little hope that I would 
achieve my ever-lofty goals. I was aware 
that my education hardly compared to 
that of students from even the neighbor-
ing towns, let alone that of students from 
fancy private schools. My standardized 
test scores were in the top tier of my high 
school but in the bottom tier of the Uni-
versity’s average admissions. If it hadn’t 
been for the handful of Bronson gradu-
ates who had successfully matriculated 

to highly-ranked universities before me, 
including my sister, and the support I 
received from my parents and a few key 
family members, I probably never would 
have applied. 

But I did. And I got in. 
I truly never could have predicted 

what the next four years had in store for 
me. Despite my general awareness of how 
far behind I’d be in comparison to my 
future peers, I thought the dual enroll-
ment courses I took at a local commu-
nity college would help prepare me for 
the increased academic rigor. I thought 
that it would be easy to find friends and a 
community on such a large campus, given 
that there were literally tens of thousands 
of students to meet. I genuinely believed 
that after leaving the town that I never 
felt I belonged in for a place like Ann 
Arbor, I would find myself, my people and 
my passion quickly. 

I was incredibly naive. 
T

he very first hurdle I faced was 
the realization that all of the 
dual enrollment credits I had 

taken during high school were worth-
less — the credits couldn’t transfer 
because the classes I took at the com-
munity college weren’t on the Univer-
sity’s “approved” list. In order to appeal 
this decision, I was expected to obtain 
the syllabi from those courses and inde-
pendently petition the professors of the 
congruent classes at the University to 
approve them. This is an outrageous 
and intimidating ask of a young, ter-
rified freshman facing such a drastic 
transition, already aware of the gaps 
in her academic preparation. Anxious 
and intimidated, I didn’t even bother 
to try, knowing that the outcome was 
less than likely to be fruitful. Instead, I 
accepted my fate and surrendered near-
ly an entire semester’s worth of credits. 
I was reminded of this every semester 
as I tried to enroll for courses, always 
last in line due to having fewer credits 
under my belt than my peers in the same 
year as me. 

With this happening in just the first 

few weeks of college, my feelings of 
inadequacy were underscored and came 
to define my freshman year at the Uni-
versity. My first semester was a blur of 
social anxiety, academic hardship and 
imposter syndrome. From the moment I 
opened my acceptance email, some part 
of me truly felt that my admission to the 
University was a fluke. I thought I wasn’t 
smart enough to be here and that all of 
my peers were far more enlightened and 

intelligent than I was. I felt that I could 
never succeed in a place like this. These 
feelings made the thought of opening up 
to my peers terrifying. 

At home, I was always one of the “smart 

ones.” But suddenly, everyone around me 
at the University was talking about their 
IB diplomas and listing the entry-level 
courses they would skip because of their 
academic backgrounds. At the same time, 
I was struggling to keep up in those entry-
level courses, as the professors frequently 
skipped over material they assumed I 
learned in high school. I was so insecure 
about whether I even deserved my place 
at this university that I thought that if I 
talked to my new classmates and dorm 
neighbors, they’d figure out that I wasn’t 
actually smart at all. 

Between unawareness and a simple 

lack of resources, the University didn’t 
help much with this transition. I didn’t 
technically qualify as a first-generation 
student because my mom and stepdad 
earned their degrees online during my 
childhood, so the community and the 
resources for first-generation students 
weren’t available to me. There’s no pro-
gram on campus that specifically seeks to 
aid students who are expected to teach 
themselves class material that professors 
assumed I had learned. I was too embar-
rassed to admit what I felt was my stu-
pidity during office hours, so I had two 
options: seek out tutoring or deal with it. 
I couldn’t afford tutoring, so I was left to 
fend for myself.

Eventually, I started to adjust. During 

the second semester of my freshman year, 
I finally found a small, like-minded group 
of friends with similar academic experi-
ences who made the transition a bit easi-
er. Slowly but surely, I taught myself how 
to study, how to write papers and how to 
teach myself all of the material that pro-
fessors skipped over. I really started to 
wish my high school economics teacher 
had placed more of an emphasis on those 
macroeconomic concepts. Still, I pushed 
through, even when I spent countless 
hours in the UgLi studying for an exam 
that I ultimately performed poorly on 
despite my best efforts and great desire to 
understand the material. 

I later learned that my lack of academ-

ic preparedness wasn’t the only factor 
contributing to the hardship I’ve faced 
at the University. Just two months ago, 
as a second-semester senior, I was diag-
nosed with attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder — meaning that I endured 
nearly the entirety of my undergraduate 

career undiagnosed and untreated for 
something that makes learning so much 
more difficult. Those times that I barely 
even managed to finish timed exams that 
I spent countless hours studying for, and 
that everyone else finished much more 
quickly, suddenly made a lot more sense. 

I applied and chose to attend this uni-

versity because I wanted to learn and I 
wanted to be challenged. I thought that 
the hardship I was facing was exactly 
what I had asked for. To an extent, it was. 
But I wasn’t supposed to face it alone. 
And it wasn’t supposed to be as hard as 
it was. 
M

y acceptance into the School 
of Public Health saved me 
from giving up on my academ-

ic goals. As soon as I was able to dive into 
a field of study that I was deeply passion-
ate about, I finally found myself perform-
ing better academically. The support I’ve 
received in this program from my advi-
sors, professors and peers is invaluable. 

As my undergraduate career comes to 

a close, I’ve managed to earn University 
Honors and obtained my first 4.0 semes-
ter grade point average in Fall 2020. 
These accomplishments feel so small to 
students who came in prepared, but for 
me and my family, I may as well have won 
an Olympic gold medal. 

Still, looking back, I can’t help but 

wonder how my academic experience 
would have been different had there been 
resources available for students like me. 
It was hard to find people with similar 
backgrounds because I was too embar-
rassed to talk about my struggles — and 
they probably were, too. For those of us 
who don’t technically fall into those first-
generation college student categories, or 
who attended a high school like mine, it’s 
incredibly intimidating to talk about our 
experiences without having feelings of 
inadequacy take over. 

I felt all of those feelings, in addition 

to pure loneliness, for so much of my 
undergraduate career. It took until my 
senior year to truly feel that I belong here. 
Nobody should have to feel that way.

If you’re reading this and my story 

resonates with you in any way: you’re not 
alone. I wish that there was some cohesive 
community on campus for students like us, 
but unfortunately, there isn’t. Until there 
is, please remember: You belong here. You 
were admitted because you deserve to be 
here. You’re intelligent, competent, pow-
erful and worthy. Go to office hours and 
don’t be afraid to ask for help. And, most of 
all, please don’t give up.

R

ecently I time-traveled 100 
years in the past. I didn’t go 
to a historical house to find 

out what life was like on the frontier, 
I didn’t churn my own butter or read 
the Farmers’ Almanac by candlelight, 
but I did witness an internal party 
primary for New Mexico’s 1st 
Congressional District. This arcane 
process was the norm prior to the 
early 20th century, with party 
insiders — or in this case, members 
of the State Central Committee — 
choosing their preferred candidate 
instead of the huddled masses. 

Climate scientist and state Rep. 

Melanie Stansbury, D-Albuquerque, 
triumphed in the State Central 
Committee 
runoff 
over 
state 

Sen. 
Antoinette 
Sedillo 
López, 

D-Albuquerque, who was also the 
first Latina law professor at the 
University of New Mexico. Sedillo 
López placed third in the 2018 
primary for this district; Stansbury 
did not run. Stansbury, being one 
of the only white candidates, was 
an underwhelming choice for some 

to succeed Deb Haaland, one of 
the first (alongside Rep. Sharice 
Davids, D-Kan.) Native American 
women in Congress. Stansbury 
would arguably have a slim chance 
of winning the Democratic primary 
without the current rush to select a 
representative.

The congressional seat needs a 

replacement because the incumbent, 
Haaland, was recently confirmed 
by the Senate to her new position, 
Secretary of the Interior. The election 
was a scramble that eventually went 
to a runoff. Throughout the race 
there were multiple calls to replace 
Haaland with another woman of 
color, claiming this would honor 
Haaland. I’d like to unravel what it 
means when someone says they want 
to honor their predecessor. 

The presidency of Lyndon B. 

Johnson was overshadowed by 
the tenure of his predecessor, the 
assassinated former President John 
F. Kennedy. Likewise, the tenure 
of Melanie Stansbury will likely 
be overshadowed by her historic 

predecessor. But what will Stansbury 
owe to Secretary Haaland and her 
legacy if — most likely, when — she 
takes office? 

Some people’s first response 

will be “nothing.” If you asked a 
bundle of Joe Biden voters what 
they think the current president 
owes to former President Donald 
Trump, they would probably laugh 
in your face. Many would say that 
Biden’s only responsibility is to the 
people, not to his predecessor. In a 
winner-take-all system, the losing 
politicians don’t govern at all and 
former politicians govern even less. 
In terms of political differences 
between the two women, there 
is not much to discuss. Both are 
progressives with an emphasis 
on the environment and Native 
American issues. Stansbury has 
made solving the crisis of missing 
and murdered Indigenous women 
a notable part of her platform, 
which is something Haaland has 
prioritized both in her new job and 
her old one.

Many responses to the question 

of what is owed will have nuance 
because 
most 
politicians 
have 

nuanced responsibilities. There is 
a responsibility to execute policy, 
and more broadly to represent 
your community. I would love it if 
Stansbury could be a carbon copy 
of Haaland, but unfortunately, she 
is not. As I noted before, Secretary 
Haaland was the first Native 
American woman in Congress. 
Neither Stansbury nor her unlikely-
to-win Republican rival — Sen. 
Mark Moores, R-Albuquerque — can 
succeed her in this way. 

In one of her first releases after 

receiving the nomination, Stansbury 
tweeted, “The fight to defend Deb 
Haaland’s seat starts now.” This is an 
understandable political maneuver, 
invoking the name of an extremely 
popular politician. It does complicate 
how we think of politicians as distinct 
figures, with distinct experiences 
and policy positions. 

Stansbury wanting to honor 

Haaland is admirable but concerning. 

On the issue of representation, 
Haaland brought an irreplaceable 
perspective to Congress. Stansbury 
can honor that, and continue the 
work Haaland did in uplifting Native 
communities nationwide, without 
passing herself off to be some sort 
of anointed heir. This problem of 
branding would not be so bothersome 
if Stansbury were not a remarkable 
and compelling candidate in her 
own right. Running explicitly as a 
replacement to a person, as opposed 
to a proponent of an idea, does not 
allow a politician to flourish as an 
honest legislator. Stansbury should 
run as Stansbury because to run as 
Haaland 2.0 is dishonest.

This may be a niche observation 

about one congressional race in 
one of the most sparsely populated 
states in the nation. But this sort of 
thing happens often, most recently 
with a vice president, one politician 
running as the spiritual successor 
to another. I don’t care for it, and 
neither should you. 

In an age of political compass tests, 

vote analyses and other desperate 
attempts 
to 
differentiate 
non-

differentiable candidates based on 
ideology, marketing yourself as “I’m 
like this person!” may seem to be a 
silver bullet for lackluster candidates, 
but it is never accurate. Politicians, 
especially those wanting to have a 
real effect on the national dialogue or 
public policy, should not strive to be 
indifferent from their predecessors. 

Back to our fundamental question 

of what a candidate owes to their 
predecessor — they owe what they 
owe to any constituent: honesty. 
Stansbury can carry forth Haaland’s 
bold climate initiatives, kind spirit 
and fierce advocacy without using 
her shadow as cover from potential 
attacks. The primary debt, I will 
remind you, is to the voters. Voters 
deserve an honest candidate who 
is not beholden to politicians of the 
past, no matter how popular they are.

And that makes sense.
Despite Michigan’s hesitancy to 

enforce new COVID-19 restrictions, 
it is clear that abandoning common 
sense measures in favor of vaccines 
will result in more unnecessary 
deaths. We call on Gov. Whitmer 
to mandate the necessary public 
health restrictions immediately, as 
called for by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. Then we 
can ask for more doses.

Whitmer’s recent request for 

more vaccines from the federal 
government 
goes 
against 
the 

guidance of the director of the CDC, 
who has asked Michigan to “shut 
things down” as of April 12. Even if 
the requested vaccines all got here 
tomorrow, were distributed quickly 
and injected into Michiganders’ 
arms, full immunity still takes five 
weeks to take effect with the Pfizer/
BioNTech vaccine and six weeks 
to take effect with the Moderna 
vaccine because both require two 
doses. In other words, additional 
vaccines, if distributed now, will 
not create immunity fast enough to 
slow the surge. 

The spike in Michigan could be 

a harbinger of things to come for 
other states, so increasing vaccine 
allocation to any state experiencing 
a spike would unlikely prove to 
be an effective long-term strategy 
in the months to come. Instead, 
policymakers should focus on 
implementing 
and 
enforcing 

effective restrictions and directing 
available vaccines to the most 
vulnerable communities.

Whitmer’s job is to make 

the decisions that will protect 
Michigan residents, even when 
they are unpopular. As an elected 
leader, she is uniquely situated 
to influence the state’s safety 
measures and decide the trajectory 
of this outbreak. Even in the face of 

fierce political opposition or strong 
community pushback, she must 
mandate safety measures that will 
save lives. Her legacy will be shaped 
by COVID-19’s impact on Michigan 
and beyond, so shying away from 
long-term well-being to avoid short-
term political pushback would be 
betraying her responsibility and 
commitment to the state.

Moreover, these mandates are 

only effective if a critical mass of 
the population follows them, so 
Whitmer should make clear how 
important safety measures are 
to the state’s long term health. 
As the weather gets warmer and 
more people get vaccinated, it’s 
easy to feel that the pandemic 
must be over. However, the spike 
in cases and deaths makes clear 
that this pandemic is not over, 
and the more we pretend it is, 
the longer it will go on. Michigan 
residents, including University 
of Michigan students, should 
be following suggestions from 
both the state and the University. 
All should practice the same 
social distancing measures they 
have throughout the pandemic, 
including avoiding unnecessary 
travel, wearing masks and keeping 
social 
gatherings 
small 
and 

outdoors whenever possible. But it 
is unreasonable to ask residents to 
follow instructions it seems their 
governor doesn’t even support. 
This is why Whitmer needs to 
take decisive action and use her 
voter-given power to enact these 
measures.

It is critical to consider the 

number of citizens in Michigan 
who are hesitant to get vaccinated 
when 
discussing 
this 
current 

outbreak. If a significant proportion 
of Michiganders avoid vaccination, 
outbreaks will continue, and the 
risk of variants will increase. 

Some individuals may not have the 
information necessary to make that 
decision, and a state- or nation-wide 
information campaign could sway 
initially hesitant people to get the 
vaccine.

Some communities don’t trust 

the health care system because it 
discriminates against people of 
color, specifically Black people, 
and 
Black 
Michiganders 
are 

underrepresented in the vaccine 
rollout, even after the federal 
government set up a mass site at 
Ford Field in Detroit. According 
to an MLive article, Black people 
made up less than 10% of people 
who got vaccinated at Ford Field, 
despite making up almost 80% of 
Detroit’s population. Therefore, 
any vaccination campaign must 
acknowledge vaccine hesitancy 
in different communities and 
focusing on addressing both the 
symptoms and sources of that 
mistrust. 
Education, 
outreach 

and accessibility are crucial to 
ensuring people get the shots and 
stay safe. This is one aspect of the 
vaccine rollout the governor can 
prioritize along with the necessary 
mandates.

It is clear that more mandates 

are unpopular and tiresome. After 
more than a year of living in this 
pandemic, 
Michiganders 
want 

nothing more than to finally enjoy 
the benefits of loosened restrictions. 
However, the current COVID-19 
spike in our state shows that, while 
the end seems in sight, we are still 
in the midst of a global pandemic. 
Vaccines are just one weapon 
in defeating the virus, and they 
won’t work unless accompanied by 
public health mandates. Michigan’s 
leaders must respond to this 
crisis and residents should listen, 
no matter how unpopular those 
measures may be.

EMILY LAWSIN & SCOTT KURASHIGE | OP-ED CONTRIBUTORS

I

n the aftermath of the Atlanta-
area spa shootings and a 
continued upsurge in anti-

Asian violence, leaders of colleges 
and universities across the country 
have issued statements denouncing 
anti-Asian racism and extending 
support to members of the Asian 
American community. 

Anyone who has been around 

academe for even a moderate 
amount of time has come to expect 
such statements in the wake of 
national tragedies, such as the 
death of George Floyd in police 
custody, the white supremacist mob 
violence in Charlottesville, Va., and 
the mass murders at Charleston, 
S.C.’s Emanuel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church and Pittsburgh’s 
Tree of Life Synagogue. 

Such statements can help to 

reassure members of historically 
marginalized 
communities 
that 

their concerns register with decision-
makers and remind them of their 
commitment to inclusion. However, 
we have also come to expect that 
these statements will sadly be 
received by many as performative 
acts unless they are followed by 
transformative measures to redress 
long-standing problems of structural 
racism and other forms of inequity.

The 
breadth 
and 
scope 
of 

statements in the past few weeks 
addressed to Asian Americans 
seems 
unprecedented, 
signaling 

a possible watershed moment. A 
quick internet search turns up 
well over one hundred statements 
connected to institutions of higher 
education. The American Historical 
Association released the “Statement 
on Violence against Asians and 
Asian Americans” co-signed by 44 
scholarly organizations.

Over the next few years, we 

will see how much that sentiment 
translates into action. For instance, 
institutions with Asian American 
Studies departments, majors and 
doctorate programs are few and far 
between. Students and scholars in 
the field generally need to find space 
for their work within traditional 
disciplines 
or 
interdisciplinary 

units. This usually means relying 
on non-specialists to recognize the 
significance of their work, which can 
often involve more interpersonal and 
emotional negotiation than cerebral 
academic pursuit. Expanded course 
offerings and tenured faculty hires 
in Asian American Studies would 
help to remedy that problem. 

Indeed, 
many 
colleges 
and 

universities still have no more than 
a token number of Asian American 
Studies courses or, even more 
commonly, none at all. Dedicated 
cultural 
centers 
or 
counseling 

staffed by full-time experts in Asian 
American student affairs are also the 
exceptions rather than the norm. As 
such, for decades, Asian American 
students and advocates have been 
pushing for more resources and 
investments 
by 
their 
schools, 

including at some of the most 
prominent and wealthy institutions 
in the world.

We may also see a wave of new 

hires at all levels of Asians and Asian 
Americans within not only higher 
education but also within media, 
government 
and 
corporations. 

Some of these openings will provide 
opportunities for exceptional talents 
that have long been overlooked. 
History, however, cautions us to 

be wary of cynical and token hires. 
Arguably the most notorious Asian 
American hire in history was the 
appointment of S.I. Hayakawa, 
endorsed by then-California Gov. 
Ronald Reagan, as president of San 
Francisco State College during the 
Third World Liberation Front strike 
for Ethnic Studies in 1968-69. The 
conservative 
Hayakawa 
became 

the “model minority” symbol of 
state repression to end the strike 
with a brutal police crackdown that 
left hundreds of students beaten, 
bloodied and jailed — though not 
defeated. 

The editors of the acclaimed 2012 

anthology, “Presumed Incompetent: 
The Intersections of Race and Class 
for Women in Academia,” warned to 
watch for the use of a woman of color 
“pet” or “mascot” whose purpose is 
to reinforce structures of oppression. 
The book says, “The pet may be 
a 
key 
administrator’s 
personal 

favorite, who serves as the official 
spokesperson for all faculty of color. 
She may be the ‘exceptional’ woman 
of color whose accomplishments 
(real or imagined) or compliant 
attitude put other faculty of color 
in a negative light. In public, the 
pet makes a dramatic display of 
her selfless efforts to support 
colleagues of color. In private, the 
pet is harshly critical of the teaching 
and scholarship of these same 
colleagues, thereby reinforcing the 
race- and gender-based presumption 
of incompetence.” 

One of the immediate tests of 

sensitivity toward the concerns 
of Asian American workers and 
students is whether employers and 
schools will require in-person labor 
and instruction. Echoing concerns 
expressed by Black and Latinx 
parents, Asian Americans have been 
reluctant to send their K-12 children 
back to school in person, and these 
concerns cut across geography, class 
and ethnicity. It 
is not hard to 

see how many of the same factors 
identified 
in 
an 
eye-opening 

Washington Post article may also 
apply to college-level instruction, as 
well as employment more broadly. 

First 
and 
foremost, 
Asian 

American parents and students 
have expressed alarm at the racial 
harassment 
and 
assault 
they 

and others have faced. The fear 
of such incidents extends from 
the classroom and playground 
to 
walking 
or 
taking 
public 

transportation 
to 
and 
from 

campus. In our mentoring of 
Asian American students, we have 
repeatedly heard reports of Asian 
American women being subjected 
to harassment and abuse especially 
when drinking and partying take 
place. Even college students who 
studiously avoid parties can be 
subjected to such attacks while 
walking home from the library or 
study group meetings. 

Second, Asian Americans harbor 

fears of COVID-19 spread not only 
to themselves but also to vulnerable 
members of their families and 
communities. Nearly 30% of Asian 
Americans live in multigenerational 
households. Society often thinks of 
Asian Americans as the stereotypical 
“model minority” student going 
to an elite university. The reality is 
that most Asian Americans attend 
community colleges or state schools 
like those we have previously 
taught at, where students routinely 

commute to campus from homes 
with parents and grandparents. 
The concern is escalated at the 
colleges and universities that are not 
requiring students to be vaccinated, 
even as it becomes widely available. 

Third, Asian Americans share 

the concerns of other groups 
who live with dependents or 
household 
members 
who 
are 

immunocompromised. For example, 
we are parents of a kindergartner 
with Down syndrome and one study 
has found that individuals with this 
condition are ten times more likely 
to die of COVID-19 than the general 
population. Further, assuming test 
trials go well, young children are not 
likely to be eligible for a vaccine prior 
to 2022. And even if K-12 children 
have the option of virtual learning, 
this won’t mean much if their 
parents and guardians are required 
to work in person and can’t be at 
home. Vaccinated adults may have 
a low risk of hospitalization, death 
and reduced risk of transmission, 
but new strains are challenging that. 
How much risk should be tolerable in 
a deadly pandemic? This is a decision 
that parents should have the right to 
determine in consultation with their 
medical providers. 

Finally, 
Asian 
American 

employees and students deserve 
the option of virtual work and 
instruction on a full-time basis to 
alleviate mental illness. Otherwise, 
being forced to choose between 
undesirable 
options 
will 
only 

heighten the stress and anxiety that 
have already escalated for Asian 
Americans during the pandemic. 
Asian Americans have reported a 
higher level of concern for COVID-
19 than the general U.S. population 
and 
heightened 
anxiety 
about 

racist harassment and attacks. As 
Dr. Tung Nguyen, director of the 
Asian American Research Center on 
Health at the University of California 
– San Francisco, has noted, Asian 
American mental health issues “tend 
to be under-diagnosed and under-
discussed.” 

Through the pandemic, many 

of us have normalized grocery 
shopping, dining out, watching 
movies 
and 
even 
attending 

parties and weddings through the 
internet. Instructors have gone to 
extraordinary lengths to develop 
pedagogical 
techniques 
over 

Zoom and through asynchronous 
learning. Why should anyone be 
forced to assume unnecessary risks 
when effective and viable forms 
of work and teaching can occur 
online? 

The message to leaders of higher 

education and corporate employers 
should be clear. Asian Americans 
have heard your statements. 

Now it’s time to listen to us in 

shaping the policies and priorities 
that will exemplify your true values.

From The Daily: Governor 

Whitmer, take action

M

ichigan’s COVID-19 surge is the worst in the country. In the past 
week, we have had more cases and deaths per capita than any 
other state. In response, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has issued a set 

of suggestions to curb the spread, such as limiting in-person dining capacity 
and switching to virtual learning for the next two weeks, but she has not 
issued any new mandates or restrictions. Instead, she has turned to the federal 
government, asking for more allocation of vaccines to navigate the crisis. 
But the federal government has denied her request, stating that the solution 
is to curb the spread through social measures rather than medical ones.

F

or those currently unaware, in the state of 
Michigan, everyone — and yes that means 
everyone — above the age of 16 is eligible to receive 

a COVID-19 vaccine as of April 5. This is the case country-
wide, for the most part, with the exception of a few states 
that are expanding their eligibility soon. 

In other words, the time to get vaccinated is upon us. 

The University of Michigan has already vaccinated over 
40,000 individuals and that number is likely to increase 
soon, particularly among our now eligible student 
population. As I wrote not long ago, it is imperative that 
students get vaccinated as soon as possible; doing so is not 
only vital for the betterment of the community’s public 
health, but also for increasing the possibilities 
for various gatherings and related activities 
during the upcoming fall semester. 

On a national scale, around 35% of the 

United States’s population has received at 
least the first dose of a vaccine. If we remain at 
the current pace of vaccination, we can expect 
that number to reach at least 75% by the end of 
June, if not higher. Slowly but surely, normal is in 
sight — so again, go get vaccinated. 

Now that my biweekly plea to my peers to get 

vaccinated has been made, it’s important to also 
think about what happens after the U.S. has reached 
the target vaccination level. After all, for many, 
including myself, normalcy includes the freedom to travel 
internationally. On either end — traveling outside of the 
U.S. or returning home — proof of vaccination is likely 
going to be a requirement for entry at some point. 

Vaccination passports, which are essentially digitized 

proofs of vaccination, are beginning to be tested by a 
handful of companies and institutions here in the U.S. 
While the topic remains relatively controversial amongst 
some politicians, a vaccination mandate of some sort could 
possibly be a smart idea (and a legal one, for those worried) 
for maintaining safety within some contexts. 

But the argument against these “passports” is more 

nuanced than the blanket statement of “I don’t like the 
restrictions a mandate like this imposes on my freedoms,” 
although that certainly is a stance for those also against 
vaccination in the first place. To those individuals, I 
urge you to read the Centers for Disease Control and 

Prevention’s article detailing the benefits of vaccination. 

Now, back to my main point. To illustrate it best, 

let’s consider a hypothetical. You are looking to attend a 
Detroit Pistons game with some friends next winter and 
the NBA, or even simply the Pistons themselves, have 
an application or system that requires you to sign in and 
verify your vaccination status. While for some it won’t be 
an issue, there are many who will be concerned about 
the fact that the Detroit Pistons organization now has 
access to part of their health-related information — your 
vaccination records and maybe more. That is just one 

possible scenario. 

Imagine how many leisure or non-essential activities 

one does within a week, such as dining at a restaurant 
or going to the gym. Depending on how something 
like a vaccination passport is implemented, all of these 
organizations could theoretically have data about parts 
of your vaccination history. 

While that concern could likely be mitigated if a 

standardized means of checking vaccination status can 
be established, we are far from that point. The companies 
and institutions experimenting with such a system are 
not using the same means of checking vaccination status; 
each is using their own technologies and that variation 
in technology is where the heart of the privacy concern 
comes into play. If every company across the U.S. were 
to use the same methods for checking, privacy concerns 
could likely be quelled. 

There is also the concern of the false sense of security 

that implementing a standardized vaccination passport 
might bring. There will be many that will likely interpret 
such proof of vaccination as equivalent to not having the 
disease, or being safe from getting it. Indeed, the approved 
COVID-19 vaccines have shown to be effective in trials 
thus far, but one should not equate vaccination with 
guaranteed immunity.

And, of course, there are various equity-related 

concerns. 
Both 
domestically 
and 
especially 

internationally, many have not or are not going to be able 
to receive a vaccine for some time. In that regard, there 
has to be a push and pull between mandating vaccination 
and making sure the white and wealthy do not have an 

unfair “immuno-privilege” because of how access to 

vaccines has unfolded on a global scale. 

At the same time, vaccination passports 

have the ability to establish an efficient and 
possibly more reliable means of keeping the 
virus from entering certain establishments, 
or even the country as a whole. In other 
words, the passport idea is not all bad. Proof 
of vaccination, at the end of the day, is the 
most likely way of providing assurance that 
one does not have COVID-19. The implications 
for hospitals, care facilities, etc., who have been 
restricting loved ones from connecting while 
sick with other conditions are considerable. 
With all of that being said, in no way should 

these criticisms of passports persuade anyone from 
getting vaccinated. They are the most effective way to 
protect oneself from the virus and to ensure a return to 
some degree of normalcy soon, at least domestically. Still, 
as more of us get vaccinated, there will need to be some 
thorough policy considerations from our governments 
and the private sector. Prioritizing privacy, equity and 
public health all at the same time is not an easy thing to 
do — but it needs to be done. 

Until we reach that point, the message remains the 

same: Go get vaccinated. For U-M students, there are only 
about two weeks left in the semester; make it happen so 
the fall can be enjoyed alongside others. 

I

’ve talked a great deal about the ongoing sanctions 
campaign by the United States against Iran — arguably 
more than anyone should. Nevertheless, I believe there is 

a good reason for talking about the sanctions so much: They are 
one of the longest sustained campaigns of immiseration against 
any country, outside of wartime, in the last century. 

As I stated in my column in January, they have wreaked 

havoc on Iran’s economy and severely hampered its ability to 
fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, in April, as the academic 
semester draws to a close, I’d like to turn away from the 
humanitarian devastation these sanctions have wrought and 
instead turn to the diplomatic devastation. Specifically, I would 
like to examine how President Joe Biden’s refusal to rejoin the 
Iran nuclear deal unless Iran’s government meets ridiculous 
preconditions is a massive error that could haunt him for the 
rest of his presidency. 

First, a little background. The current sanctions on Iran 

were put into place in 2018 as part of former President Donald 
Trump’s decision to leave the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action, colloquially referred to as the “Iran nuclear deal.” Our 
side of that deal was agreeing not to re-impose sanctions in 
exchange for Iran not developing nuclear weapons. Since the 
Iran nuclear deal was widely seen as one of former President 
Barack Obama’s key foreign policy achievements, it was natural 
that then-candidate Biden would support rejoining it. And, 
to his credit, he technically hasn’t broken that promise. That 
is because, even during the campaign, he stated that the U.S. 
would only rejoin the deal “if Iran returns to strict compliance,” 
which they have not done yet. 

However, Iran has a good reason not to make the first step 

toward compliance. We broke compliance first, not them. In 
fact, not only did they not resume building nuclear weapons 
until after we abandoned the deal, they did not resume building 
nuclear weapons until last November, two and a half years later. 
And they only did so after their top nuclear scientist, Mohsen 
Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated in an ambush that Iran alleges 
was coordinated by the Israeli government. By any reasonable 
standards of deal-making, it is incumbent on the party that 
originally broke the deal to take the first steps toward restoring 
it — therefore, the U.S. should initiate the return to compliance.

Even if Biden were to reverse course today and repeal 

sanctions, it may be too late. Iran has a presidential election 
this summer, and incumbent President Hassan Rouhani — the 
moderate who signed the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 — cannot run 
again because he is term-limited. Meanwhile, the U.S.’s breaking 
of the Iran deal is widely perceived to have given an advantage to 
the conservative, or “principlist” side, which has always opposed 
the nuclear deal. After all, the principlists’ position in 2015 — that 
the U.S. was not trustworthy — has been well borne-out by our 
breaking of the deal. So, even if we were to return to the deal, it 
is not likely that the next Iranian government will trust us to 
maintain that compliance between administrations. 

Additionally, while Trump is largely to blame for breaking 

the deal in the first place and creating that mistrust, Biden’s 
refusal to drop his preconditions sends an even worse message: 
that neither U.S. party can be trusted to honestly and fairly 
maintain the deal. Biden could have earned the reputation as 
the president that at least tried to repair our broken relationship 
with Iran. Instead, he will likely go down as the president that 
solidified our diplomacy’s ruinous fate.

Moreover, regardless of if Iran chooses to go back to 

upholding its end of the deal, we should go back to upholding 
ours. First, it’s the right thing to do from a humanitarian 
standpoint. Even if Iranians choose to elect a government that 
wants to build nuclear weapons, that is still not a just reason to 
continue to starve their people. Think tanks funded by large 
defense corporations, which benefit from presenting Iran as 
a threat, do not believe that Iran would use these weapons 
offensively, so essentially we are causing immense pain to the 
Iranian people to deny them the capacity to defend themselves. 

But, more relevantly to our diplomatic interests, returning to 

compliance with no immediate reward would show Iranians 
that the principlist view of America is wrong and that we have 
the potential to be an honest and trustworthy deal maker. And 
while it is highly unlikely that the next Republican president 
would maintain compliance with the deal, especially if Iran 
doesn’t immediately stop building weapons, being an honest 
actor half the time still sends a better message to Iran, and to the 
world, than never being one at all.

SIERRA ÉLISE HANSEN | COLUMNIST

A

ccording to the bipartisan standards 
by which political “truths” are 
measured and spoon-fed to us, truth 

has come to sound more like something to 
aspire to rather than a lived, tangible reality. 
If you are like the average person, surfing the 
internet feels like a part of being alive. You 
might feel as if you’re always consuming a lot 
of information (primarily tweets and scandals 
rather than Dostoyevsky), but nevertheless, 
reading is a part of your day.

Especially given the ubiquity of the internet 

amid the ongoing pandemic, one can assume 
that many Americans have spent even more 
time with their thoughts hovering in virtual 
space than they did before. And, that’s in a 
world which unapologetically centered the 
internet during pre-pandemic times.

As someone who relied on libraries as 

sanctuaries of focus before quarantine, I 
had to implement huge adjustments in order 
to focus at home. More than that, I simply 
yearned for the feeling of holiness that would 
pass over me as I opened a hard-bound book 
from a time period that lapsed before I was 
born. I worried that I wouldn’t be able to 
reproduce anything close to it in quarantine, 
and indeed I have not.

In direct opposition to a work of writing that 

is developed over many weeks, months and 
sometimes years, social media, like advertising, 
is constantly being run through a machine 
of algorithms and analytics. So, what are we 
missing? Reading “for pleasure” is more than 
a pastime — the slow simmering of processing 
what we read can become a catalyst for the 
mind’s steady growth. It is also a portal through 
which knowledge can be tested; that is, if we are 
granted access to that knowledge in the first 
place.

I’d like to make an abrupt suggestion, which 

is that we make a cultural shift toward an idea 
that isn’t so new after all: We should center the 
library as a mainstay of public life. Libraries are 
so much more than spaces filled with materials 
for personal consumption. Even in today’s era 
of rampant dis- and misinformation, libraries 
are still considered to be trusted, boasted public 
institutions.

During an extremely scary, uncertain fall 

semester when no one knew with any degree 
of certainty that America’s democracy would 
remain intact, it felt as if a constant swarm of 
information was flowing through my brain 
each day. It happened regardless of whether 
I wanted it to or not. Like many of you, I was 
confined to my apartment, which I often 
resented. I continuously engaged in what has 
been referred to as “doomscrolling” (or, in 
an extension of that same modern parlance, 
“doomsurfing”). 

Doomscrolling felt like the only form 

of control I was able to exercise over the 
entrapment of those circumstances; I engaged 
in it more so as a mechanism for distraction. 
As we are all aware now as we were back then, 
there was no control to be exercised at all, by 
any one of us, over anything. Well, outside of the 
act of stepping into the voting booth — maybe 
even waiting in impossibly long lines to exercise 
our right to vote.

But then I remembered something else that 

has stuck with me throughout the pandemic-
induced lockdown. Despite how the shuttering 
of libraries feels neutral, I realized that the 
continuous pang of absence resulting from my 
inability to step foot in a campus library was 
more than a deeply personal experience — it 
was the revelation of wanting to salvage the 
social purposes of the public library. More 

specifically, I remembered an op-ed in the 
New York Times penned by Eric Klinenberg, 
a sociology professor at New York University 
professor, titled, “How Libraries Can Save 
the 2020 Election.” I recall being struck 
immediately by the content of the article at the 
time that I happened across it. 

While citing Postmaster General Louis 

DeJoy’s decision to remove or cripple key 
components of America’s mail system right 
before the election, Klinenberg posits the 
importance of libraries for collective use and 
remedy. He writes that “there is a largely 
overlooked part of the civic infrastructure that 
is ready and able to help Americans exercise 
the franchise (of voting), even under these 
troubling circumstances: libraries.”

Immediately after reading that sentence, 

I pondered my own experience with the 
libraries of my youth — one of living inside 
the articulations of time-worn fonts within 
the concrete walls of my elementary school’s 
library. I recalled nostalgically that this 
childhood library had shelves lining the middle 
of the school building, and that students would 
walk past the bindings when going anywhere. 
I remembered that sometimes, when I was 
bored in class, I would steal away to these 
shelves while “going to the bathroom” so that I 
could read.

I also recalled James Baldwin discussing 

the fact that he read in his local libraries not 
out of a sense of boredom, but as an avenue 
for fighting against the limitations imposed 
upon him by the outside world — a world that 
certainly did not want him to succeed or flourish. 
Due to how Baldwin was a young Black man 
in Harlem during the 1960s, an era when the 
white status quo politicians aimed to viciously 
and purposefully oppress Black intellectuals, 

his life circumstances seemed to foreclose the 
possibility of the success he would so memorably 
achieve. However, while in conversation with 
the anthropologist Margaret Mead, Baldwin 
revealed that he’d read himself out of two 
Harlem libraries by the time he was thirteen.

Baldwin also explained to Mead that 

what he “had to do then was bring the two 
things together: the possibilities the books 
suggested and the impossibilities of the life 
around (him).” As far as the latter goes, I see 
many disturbing holdovers from the 60s when 
Baldwin was honing his craft. Predominantly 
Black schools in Detroit, Mich., are grossly 
underfunded due to, among other things, 
neglect resulting from demographic shifts 
related to white flight. What this ultimately 
means is that students from underfunded 
school districts have less overall opportunity 
to capitalize on something as intellectually 
essential as access to literature — a dearth of 
money translates easily in this case to a dearth 
of access.

One conspicuous connection that can 

be made here is that one known tool for 
remedying a particular social malady — 
that of the problem of access to reading 
material in schools with Black, Indigenous 
and other students of color — can be used to 
remedy another urgent problem of access. 
Public libraries are the systems by which 
knowledge and opportunities to exercise 
civil rights can be fairly distributed. We 
must commit to maintaining and expanding 
access through the stacks and shelves 
outside of the University of Michigan 
community.

Libraries are clearly an ideal starting 

point for improving access to both civic-
minded activities and high-quality literature 
for 
historically 
underfunded, 
neglected 

communities. They always have been, and 
always will be.

Post-pandemic, we must value libraries more

C

onservatism, as a political philosophy, espouses 
a commitment to liberty, the market economy 
and existing traditions and institutions. In the 

United States, conservatives adhere to the traditionalist 
principles in the Constitution and the values that the 
Founding Fathers included in the documents that created 
our nation. Essentially, conservatives want to conserve. 
Incremental change should always be preferred to radical 
change. Government involvement in our citizens’ lives is 
overreach. 

In the United States, the Republican Party is 

ostensibly the party of conservatism. But recent action by 
Republicans — politicians and citizens alike — contradict 
many of the values they claim to stand for as conservatives. 

For example, many businesses are considering 

requiring that customers show proof of a COVID-19 
vaccine before using their services. This is the free market 
at work — privately-owned businesses implementing 
guidelines that allow for access to their goods and services 
should customers choose to adhere to them. But Gov. 
Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., signed an executive order banning 
businesses from requiring vaccine “passports.” 

As a Republican, DeSantis should believe in the 

independence of businesses and oppose government 
intervention into their practices. But forbidding businesses 
to do what they believe is best for them constitutes 
interference. Additionally, the state of Florida requires 
vaccinations to send children to school, both public and 
private, showing that DeSantis’s actions are a political 
ploy, rather than meaningful policy, as the polarization of 
COVID-19 and its policies continues.

Another much, much more extreme example is the 

storming of the Capitol. The actions of the rioters in 
Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 were contrary to everything 
conservatives should stand for. Violently attacking an 
American institution neither upholds the Constitution nor 
promotes incremental change — it, in fact, is the opposite 
of both of those things.

If Republican politicians vehemently denounced this 

event as soon as it occurred and continually held this 
position, this wouldn’t represent how the Republican 
Party 
has 
abandoned 
conservatism. 
But 
many 

Republicans refuse to accept what this event means for 
the party and the country. 

In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection on Jan. 

6, one in five Republicans approved of the mob. Prominent 
Republicans have spread the baseless conspiracy 
theory that the rioters were actually so-called antifa 
sympathizers, rather than supporters of former President 
Donald Trump. There is no proof that this is true, but that 
didn’t stop Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., from saying on the 
House floor that there was “pretty compelling evidence” 
that the people who stormed the Capitol were involved 
with antifa. 

Of course, there are examples of Republicans who 

retain conservative principles. The Republican state and 
local officials who spoke out against the false claims of 
voter fraud did so because they believe in the integrity of 
American democracy and in protecting the Constitution. 

Further, on April 5, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., vetoed 

a bill that would have restricted the ability of transgender 
people to access health care because “the state should not 
presume to jump into the middle of every medical, human 
and ethical issue.” Still, these events became news because 

they were surprising in a time where many of the opinions 
held by Americans seem to be based on cultural division 
rather than political ideology or philosophy. 

Republicans have abandoned their adherence to small 

government and traditional values and have fallen victim 
to culture wars. Rather than focusing on crafting quality 
policy, Republican politicians and citizens are focused 
on opposing any action taken by the Democrats and 
defending the so-called victims of cancel culture.

Republicans are bound to no ideology other than 

providing an outlet for people disillusioned with the 
Democratic Party. They have abandoned the political 
and religious conservatism that has guided the party for 
most of its history. While there are likely still Republicans 
in office that abhor the policies and actions of their party, 
they refuse to speak out against them. This could be 
because they fear their voters and colleagues who fully 
agree with the party’s recent initiatives, or because they 
know staying silent is the best way to further their careers. 

Parties are allowed to grow and change as time passes; 

changing party platforms is what has allowed for social 

progress and the changing role of government. But 

the Republican Party isn’t adapting to current society. 

The party is claiming to be conservative when its 

actions prove otherwise, and it is advocating for things that 
true conservatives would never want. If the Republican 
Party were truly dedicated to conservatism, it would try to 
apply the founding documents of the United States to the 
current state of politics and society.

M

y first introduction to the possible 
future of genomic editing came 
while reading Aldous Huxley’s 

“Brave New World.” The novel begins in the 
year 2540 at an embryo factory called the 
Central London Hatching and Conditioning 
Centre. The director of the facility describes 
to a group of male students how eggs are 
modified during the gestation period of 
development to fit into five distinct castes: 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta or Epsilon. 

Beginning with Alphas as the predestined 

leaders of the World State, each subsequent 
class decreases in intelligence, rank and, by 
consequence, contribution to the government. 
As predesignated vocations become more 
mundane and insignificant, intelligence must 
be lowered so there will never be resistance 
to the regimented class system. Under the 
guise of creating a perfect society, the facility 
had created a heavily regulated and dystopian 
world.

In 2021, the sophisticated reproductive 

technologies illustrated in “Brave New World” 
do not seem as fanciful as they did when the 
book was published in 1932. The test tube 
embryos portrayed in the novel parallel 
the relatively common process of in vitro 
fertilization, which manually produces an 

embryo by combining mature eggs and sperm 
in a lab. Yet, a key difference remains, given that 
there is no genetic manipulation of the human 
genome during IVF. In pre-implantation 
genetic screening, none of the DNA in embryos 
is artificially manipulated, but certain embryos 
can be chosen for implantation based on criteria 
such as not carrying a specific disease trait. This 
could soon change with Clustered Regularly 
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats gene 
therapy, or CRISPR.

CRISPR technology is a fairly new genome 

editing method which allows specific locations 
in the human genome to be targeted using 
guide RNA and a Cas9 protein. Together, RNA 
and the Cas9 protein cleave a specific portion 
of DNA which is then repaired by the cell 
using a donor DNA template containing the 
sequence of choice. While the manipulation 
of genetic traits has had enormous societal 
and economical benefits — as can be seen 
in the Green Revolution — the altering of 
human germ cells has numerous ethical and 
moral concerns. To start, patient consent is 
impossible and any mistakes made will be 
hereditary, which may have a detrimental 
effect following cell specialization. 

The 
ethical 
limitations 
of 
CRISPR 

gene editing were recently tested by 

Chinese researcher He Jiankui in 2018. He 
“manufactured” the first CRISPR-edited 
babies through two twin girls, Lulu and Nana. 
The experiment is now known as the Lulu 
and Nana controversy — the global scientific 
community has criticized He, claiming he took 
advantage of the parents’ situation. Lulu and 
Nana’s father was HIV-positive, so He decided 
to target the CCR5 gene, which HIV can use 
as an entrance into cells — despite Lulu and 
Nana having virtually no risk of contracting 
HIV. Moreover, the edits made on Lulu were 
incorrect and incomplete, and the implications 
will not be known until later in her life. He 
blatantly disregarded worldwide standards 
for genomic editing by operating under a 
shroud of secrecy, not 
properly obtaining 

informed consent and miscategorizing the 
experiment as an “AIDS-vaccine development 
project.” Despite the amoral grounds of 
He’s CRISPR-editing attempt, his partial 
success in manipulating the human genome 
foreshadows what is to come. 

While experimenting with CRISPR-

editing techniques is complicated, the 
possibilities of its development include 
increased athleticism, intelligence and overall 
health, which are alluring to many people. 
Even still, public opinion often draws the line 

between lessening the prevalence of diseases 
and picking out traits; after all, ridding the 
world of muscular dystrophy sounds much 
better than simply wanting blue-eyed babies. 
But even when it comes to tackling lifelong 
diseases, it needs to be acknowledged that only 
a minuscule fraction of global society will have 
access to these specialized genetic treatments, 
let alone be able to afford them. As methods 
for gene editing are further explored and 
made accessible, the possibility of particular 
portions of society carrying the greatest 
amount of disease prevalence increases. 

The monetary cost of healthy embryos is 

already a barrier for Americans wanting to 
use IVF, considering each attempt can cost 
anywhere between $10,000 and $15,000 
depending on parents’ insurance and servicing 
clinic. About 1.7% of births in the United States 
are a product of IVF, compared to 4% and 5.9% 
in Belgium and Denmark, respectively, where 
reproductive assistance is publicly funded. 
Consequently, Americans without disposable 
income may not be able to access this method. 

Now consider the cost of personally 

designing a baby. How much would it cost 
to increase intelligence or decrease heart 
disease? Many people will not be able to afford 
these individualized services when taking into 

account that IVF itself is currently a luxury. 
Alongside cost, numerous racial and ethnic 
groups hold a stigma against infertility and 
genetic disorders which further decreases 
discussion and awareness of possible options. 

In addition to cost and social acceptance, 

an equally important issue is where the 
treatment clinics offering these services 
are placed. Embryo-processing facilities 
require expensive laboratories and a well-
trained staff, meaning they will not likely 
be found in low-income areas or in most 
developing countries. The repercussions will 
cause the carriers of disease to be decided 
based on location, cultural background and 
socioeconomic status. 

Almost 90 years ago, Huxley clearly 

warned of the multiple dangers to society that 
can come with sophisticated technologies like 
those he described in “Brave New World.” 
While we are still far from the bleak dystopian 
life found in Huxley’s novel, we risk the same 
class characterization by genetics if we do not 
provide the proper universal regulations and 
equitable access as designer babies become 
more of a reality.

Warning: 
Sexual 

harassment and assault.

My hands start shaking 

when I think of going back to campus. 
Shaking out of fear and anger. I can’t 
help but feel furious when I realize how 
naive and underprepared we all are as 
freshmen trying to grapple with the 
so-called “college experience.” 

It all started with the staring. I was 

desperate to make new friends after a 
conspicuous lack of Welcome Week, the 
series of parties and formal incoming 
student events scattered across campus 
at the beginning of every school year, 
due to COVID-19. When a student asked 
to sit with me at dinner after I felt his 
eyes boring into my midriff in the dining 
hall line, I hesitantly said yes — I needed 
to start meeting people and making 
friends. 

It’s no secret that sexual harassment 

and assault are widespread on college 
campuses. The documentary “The 
Hunting Ground” explored two former 
students’ experiences with sexual 
assault and their university’s failure to 
help them. Many reports are released 
every year from the University of 
Michigan that highlight disturbing 
statistics about this issue — from July 
of 2019 to June of 2020, there were 
157 reports of sexual assault and 135 
other acts of harassment, misconduct 
or stalking. While these statistics are 
illuminating, they are incomplete — only 
20% of female student victims report 
their experience to law enforcement. 
Still, I always thought with certainty I’d 
be able to tell if I was in an inappropriate 
situation … right?

After 
the 
staring 
came 
the 

inappropriate questions within only an 
hour of knowing each other, seeming so 
innocuous at the time. Wow, I thought, 
I’m finally making grown-up college 
friends! So I talked to him again. 

You’re probably thinking, “Why 

would you put yourself in that situation?” 
I ask myself that question too. All I can 
tell you is that I was isolated. I didn’t 
have a roommate and, due to COVID-19 
housing restrictions, the only souls I saw 
were dining hall workers and the cluster 
of silverfish that scuttled across the floor 
of my room at 4 a.m. 

Then, the more I hung out with him, 

the more I noticed the jokes. I saw the 
smirks he traded around the group of 
our mutual friends after he asked me, 
“Tampons or pads?” Everyone laughed. 
The guy who I thought was my friend 
started making remarks to my face 
about my chest, and eventually, he 
started forcing “hugs” on me, trying to 
feel me up while I stood still with shock. 
I finally realized what was happening. 
Once or twice a week, I would have to 
choose: Should I continue living in total 
isolation or get harassed?

People act like harassment is 

something you immediately notice. 
That’s not always true. In your 
desperation 
to 
understand 
what 

happened, you try — and sometimes 
succeed — to convince yourself it wasn’t 
that bad. Our parents’ generation went 
through this stuff all the time, right? 

Confused, I made myself speak about 

the issue with mutual friends; they were 
eager to excuse him, telling me that “the 
guys just didn’t know how to act around 
girls.” Whatever. Upset, I confided in 
a close friend whom I believed would 
support me. “Oh,” she responded. 
“That’s not that bad. Like it’s kinda bad, 
but not terrible.” I suppose what my 
friend was trying to say was, “I’ve heard 
worse,” or “You’ll get over it.” She wasn’t 
shocked or concerned because she had 
heard of so many similar experiences. I 
shut up. 

If nobody believed that what I 

experienced was worth talking about, 
what was the point in making a fuss? I 
didn’t have the energy to make a fuss. I 

receded further into myself, only leaving 
my bed in the middle of the night to 
use the bathroom. My ever-present 
anxiety increased ten-fold every time 
those people I thought were my friends 
called me in the middle of the night or 
knocked forcefully on my door. Classes 
seemed distant; I couldn’t convince 
myself to work in between my multiple 
teary anxiety attacks every day. While 
the silverfish swarmed on the floor, I 
fell further and further down a spiral 
that never seemed to end. Embarrassed 
by my terrible grades and disillusioned 
with my classes, I floundered.

I went home after the fall semester. 

When I was younger, I didn’t get along 
with my family — our opinions clash 
on everything under the sun. I couldn’t 
wait to go to college and leave the lonely 
suburb where I lived. But for now, I’m 
just grateful to be in my childhood 
bedroom, living with people I feel safe 
being around. Ultimately, what helped 
me move on was the critically acclaimed 
episode of the TV series “Sex Education” 
where Aimee’s friends help her come to 
terms with her assault. Her friends insist 
on taking the incident seriously. When I 
rewatched the episode, I started crying. 
Our peers can break us, but I won’t ever 
stop believing they can build us up, too.

Still, that doesn’t change what 

happened this year. I’m sick of college. 
I know it may sound ridiculous that the 
freshman who hasn’t even been here 
a year has complaints. But I’m sick of 
trusting the University of Michigan and 
believing things will be okay. 

The fact that countless professors 

and administrators at the University 
have been accused of sexual misconduct 
or the fact that the director of the Office 
of Institutional Equity, which handles 
sexual assault cases, is facing multiple 
lawsuits for mishandling cases doesn’t 
surprise me. Stories of assault among the 
few people I’ve met at the University are 

common. In the short online seminar 
required of all freshmen, incoming 
students are “warned” against the 
dangers of drinking, burnout and toxic 
relationships, but the topic of sexual 
assault is barely featured. 

When things fell apart for me, I had 

no concept of where to begin — I wasn’t 
sure if I wanted to report the incident, 
and even if I did, I had no idea of where 
to go. My head spun when I looked at 
the endless forms on the University’s 
website — I had no idea where to 
start, or what each option entailed. 
Overwhelmed, I stopped looking. There 
must be a better system of outreach for 
those affected by sexual assault, but 
this would require the University to 
accept the pervasive culture of sexual 
misconduct throughout campus, which 
seems unlikely.

With the University’s desperation to 

preserve their reputation, they ignore 
issues that plague their student body. 
Before my residence hall experience, 
I used to define myself as a risk-taker 
— now, I don’t fully know who I am 
anymore. 

I just want to feel safe again. I want to 

be able to get a breath of fresh air without 
being approached with comments about 
my body. I want to be able to fall asleep 
without being worried if people who 
touch me without my consent are going 
to knock on my door. I want to feel 
supported. I worry that I won’t find this 
support at the University of Michigan. 

Residents of Ann Arbor, I’m sorry 

that I can’t love your beautiful city. 
Because of the University’s harmful 
decisions affecting the student body and 
their allowance of a prevalent sexual 
assault culture, quite frankly, it’s hard to 
believe that I could ever feel safe in Ann 
Arbor.

I’m scared of Ann Arbor

TREVOR MCCARTY | OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR

The University should 
change the status quo in 

our food system

I

n its final recommendations, the University of Michigan’s 
President’s Commission on Carbon Neutrality heavily focuses, 
as expected, on carbon offsets, university infrastructure 

changes and sustainable housing. But it also addresses a crucial yet 
often-ignored piece of the puzzle: food. Importantly, our community 
is increasingly recognizing animal agriculture as a significant 
contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, global pandemics and 
environmental injustice. To address food’s impact on our carbon 
footprint, the PCCN’s recommendations include encouraging more 
plant-based options and changes in choice architecture at dining 
facilities. 

Students, faculty and administrators should support these 

changes because they are a key first step in challenging the 
unsustainable status quo in America: cheap meat from factory 
farms. The vast majority of the meat that any person (or institution) 
purchases comes from industrial animal agriculture, rather than 
a local or regenerative farm, which exacts an enormous toll on our 
environment. 

According to Science, around 57% of food’s greenhouse gas 

emissions are attributable to this industry, yet animal products only 
provide 18% of our calories. And if cows were a country, they’d be the 
third-largest global greenhouse gas emitter. But the University has the 
opportunity to kickstart a sustainable new default.

The subtle shifts in dining hall structures, menu options and food 

defaults recommended in the PCCN can nudge students to eat more 
sustainably while still preserving their ability to choose the food they 
want. According to case studies, simply setting plant-based foods as the 
default (while giving students the choice to opt in to animal products) 
can lead to an over 80% increase in diners eating these options. This 
strategy — which subverts our current destructive food norms — 
aligns with a new, dynamic food initiative known as DefaultVeg. If the 
University adopts these food policies, it would significantly reduce our 
carbon footprint — the primary goal of the PCCN. 

The University’s current dining policy, Sustainable Mondays, has 

already shown itself to be an effective tool at curbing food-related 
emissions. The PCCN provides an opportunity to amplify the impact 
of these strategies with an ambitious yet simple, scientifically verified 
approach that is compatible with different dietary preferences and 
is more inclusive in general. An added benefit of defaults and choice 
architecture is preserving food choice for students every day of the 
week. 

Food has long been left out of the climate conversation, including 

in many climate neutrality plans. However, food is rightly gaining 
momentum as one of the most pressing social challenges of our 
time, including issues of food justice and access to more sustainable 
procurement policies and the rise of plant-based products. 

Locally, consider how the City of Ann Arbor’s carbon neutrality 

plan, A2Zero, contains a call for more plant-forward food policies. 
Institutions like the City and the University are now in a unique 
position to spearhead crucial transformations in food policy. 

This straightforward idea — making plant-based foods the 

default to encourage more sustainable choices — is about more than 
reducing carbon emissions. It’s also about reframing what we think 
of as “normal food” and embracing an array of healthful, resilient and 
versatile plant-based foods at the center of our plates. 

As students of one of the country’s most prominent research 

universities, we should encourage U-M to be a trailblazer in food 
policy. If our leadership wants to seriously address the deep, systemic 
flaws in our food system, they will begin by changing the status quo 
and move toward a more just and sustainable approach.

L

ast week’s shooting near 
Indianapolis marked the sixth 
straight week containing a 

mass shooting. We see the same cycle 
after every one. Thoughts and prayers 
are followed by Democrats generally 
calling for reform and Republicans 
generally accusing the former of 
politicizing personal injury. Then a few 
weeks later, we all stop talking about it 
and move on to something else we try 
and care about for a bit. 

It seems as though everyone you 

talk to these days has their story of a 
shooting scare, or someone they know 
has such a story, ranging from the scare 
on campus a few years back to any 
number of mass shootings that have 
occurred — totaling 417 just in the year 
of 2019. What is even more disturbing 
is the racial breakdown of shooting 
victims, which is all too often left out of 
the discourse on mass shootings. 

We have said it for years, but I will 

say it again: Enough is enough. With 
talk of removing the filibuster still 
kicking around, Democrats must force 
Republicans to vote against common-
sense gun reform, which around 80% 
of Americans support in one form or 
another.

Following 
the 
Parkland, 
Fla., 

shooting, I saw this cycle take place 
in my own backyard. Politicians from 
both sides swore such a shooting would 
never happen again, but as we all 
know, that was not the case. President 
Joe Biden has fought for years to 

implement gun control measures, but 
one of the only substantive things he 
has done was include $5 billion in his 
infrastructure plan for community 
violence prevention programs. It is a 
start, but it is in no way enough. 

What we need is a comprehensive 

— and popular — gun control bill 
that would leave the more ardent 
Republicans with no choice but to cast a 
nay vote and face their constituents who 
would be in favor of implementing such 
legislation. Moreover, if Democrats 
remove the filibuster, they would be 
less able to use gun control just as a 
voting issue and doing next to nothing 
once they are in power. 

H.R. 1446 is on the docket for 

the Senate, but it is expected to be 
filibustered by Republicans. This bill 
focuses on background checks for 
gun purchases, which is a step in the 
right direction, but it is missing more 
aggressive forms of gun control. I 
propose a complete assault weapons 
ban and regulations on ghost guns.

The Assault Weapons Ban, which 

lasted from 1994 to 2004, was found 
to have decreased incidents of mass 
shootings by 25% and fatalities by 40%. 
This was a great piece of legislation 
while it lasted because it prevented 
people from purchasing military style 
assault rifles, which are the commonly 
used weapon for mass shootings in this 
country. Incidents including, but not 
limited to, the Pulse nightclub shooting 
in Orlando, Fla., the Las Vegas concert 

shooting and the Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School shooting involved 
assault weapons. These weapons must 
be banned for the sake of saving lives, 
and almost 70% of Americans agree 
with this sentiment. 

A new and huge loophole to 

circumvent a lot of these regulations is 
ghost guns. Ghost guns are weapons 
that are assembled personally through 
kits, meaning not by a corporate gun 
manufacturer. This process has always 
been legal; law enforcement never 
deemed them to be too dangerous, since 
they thought individuals usually lacked 
the expertise to assemble such a device. 
However, the actual ease and efficacy of 
these ghost guns have troubled many. 

Critically, these guns lack serial 

numbers 
or 
any 
other 
tracking 

mechanisms that law enforcement 
could use to regulate them. The solution 
to this problem is not an easy one, 
but we can begin by placing the same 
restrictions on buying ghost guns as are 

placed on regular guns. California did 
this and has had success in mandating 
serial numbers and background checks 
when applicable. New Jersey also 
criminalized the 3D printing of guns, 
another form of ghost guns. These 
regulations are incredibly important 
for preserving safety and reducing 
the amount of unregulated guns and 
subsequent violence in the United States.

These two states’ measures will not 

end the gun crisis in the U.S., but they 
will certainly save lives. The cycle of 
American gun violence always spikes 
right after a shooting and quickly 
subsides, but the problems do not go 
away for the communities affected. 

Mass shootings and gun violence 

have long wakes, filled with withspread 
harm and fear. Democrats should take 
initiative and finally accomplish a goal 
they continuously run on.

Gun violence: Let’s actually do something about it

Michigan plays assertively in win streak

The No. 25 Michigan baseball team is 

riding a five-game winning streak, which 

includes a series win over archrival Ohio State 

and a sweep at Minnesota. But the Wolverines 

still feel there’s room for improvement. 

 “I still don’t think we’re playing our very 

best baseball yet,” Michigan coach Erik 

Bakich said. “I still think there’s plenty of 

opportunity to get hot.”

Their best could still lie 

ahead, but by playing more 

assertively, 
Michigan 
has 

undisputedly heated up over 

the past five games.

Bakich 
saw 
a 
glaring 

weakness earlier in the season: 

complacency. 
Michigan 

often mirrored its opponents, 

trading scoreless innings and 

only scoring when trailing. It’s 

easy to overlook instances of 

this complacency because the 

result is usually a dramatic, 

late-inning victory. Consider the 10-inning 

win against Penn State on Mar. 27 — in which 

the Wolverines came back from a five-run 

deficit — or the 6-5 win against Maryland on 

Apr. 4, when the two teams traded runs and 

Michigan was simply the last to score. 

But sometimes, the strategy backfires and 

the Wolverines’ opponent is last to score. 

Such was the case in an 8-3 loss to Iowa 

on Mar. 7, when the Hawkeyes scored six 

unanswered runs in the final three innings, 

and a 10-inning, 3-2 defeat at Penn State on 

Mar. 26. 

Michigan has long been aware of these 

tendencies, but initially struggled to make a 

change.

“We can’t wait around to the ninth inning,” 

senior designated hitter Danny Zimmerman 

said on Apr. 5. The day before, the Wolverines 

trailed Northwestern 4-1 in the ninth but 

then loaded the bases for Zimmerman, who 

represented the winning run. He struck out.

“We can’t always win in the ninth; we’ve 

got to do it earlier.” 

Added Bakich on Mar. 22, after a 

comeback against Michigan State fell short: 

“You still have to have a sense of urgency 

each inning. You can’t just wait and expect 

that (a ninth-inning comeback) is always 

going to happen.”

Over the past five games, though, 

Michigan has played more assertively, 

scoring early, pitching well and keeping its 

opponent out of contention from the start. 

Its starters combined for a commanding 2.15 

ERA during that stretch. The bullpen never 

let the opponent back into any game. On 

defense, the Wolverines committed just four 

errors and turned 10 double plays. They also 

scored early and often, whether adding to a 

double-digit onslaught or sealing a win with 

a few insurance runs.

In the second game of last weekend’s series, 

when Michigan traded zeros with Minnesota 

for the first eight innings 

before breaking the scoreless 

tie with a four-run ninth, that 

complacency seemed to be back. 

But sophomore right-hander 

Cameron Weston contributed 

an assertive seven innings of 

shutout ball and junior right-

hander Willie Weiss earned the 

win with 1.2 innings in relief, 

striking out every batter he 

faced.

“It’s not always based on 

hitting,” Bakich said. “What 

Cam Weston and Willie Weiss 

did yesterday from the pitching side of things 

was very loud as well.”

The Wolverines are becoming assertive 

at the right time; they’ll need to play that 

way in upcoming matchups against Indiana 

and Nebraska, their two toughest opponents 

of the season, to keep their Big Ten 

championship hopes alive. 

“That’s what’s needed to be a successful 

team,” Bakich said.

While early in the season, the Wolverines relied on strong late-game 
performances, they’ve been scoring early and often in the past two series.

‘M’ wins Big Ten title

On Saturday, the No. 3 Michigan field hockey 

team celebrated a senior class that had notched 

one postseason and three regular-season Big Ten 

titles, in addition to a Final Four appearance in 

2017. With such a decorated class being honored, 

the Wolverines were determined to send their 

seniors off with a win. 

They did just that. Michigan (10-2 overall, 6-0 

Big Ten) defeated Indiana (1-13, 4-3 Big Ten) 3-0, in 

a season-ending matchup designated as non-con-

ference due to COVID-19.

While the team’s final 

game at Phyllis Ocker Field 

was a celebration of the 

Wolverines’ departing vet-

erans, the younger players 

impacted the match early.

Freshman 
midfielder 

Pilar Oliveros scored the first 

goal of her Michigan career 

with about a minute remain-

ing in the first quarter. Redshirt junior forward 

Kate Burney extended the lead later on, netting her 

first of the season. Once again, the Wolverines were 

buoyed by the performance of its depth pieces.

“The Big Ten is a very difficult conference 

with some extraordinary teams, so being able to 

win the (regular season) championship has a lot 

to do with our depth,” Michigan coach Marcia 

Pankratz said. “We can really run two full lines of 

players and keep everybody fresh, so that versa-

tility has meant a lot and you can see it today with 

Pili and Burney getting those first goals.”

During the stretches of time between those 

two scores, the Wolverines continued to dominate 

the Hoosiers with possession but struggled to find 

the back of the net from scoring range. In physical 

matchups that leave many bodies in the scoring cir-

cle with more loose officiating on the field, frustra-

tions can mount. The Wolverines, however, stayed 

patient to eventually find both goals.

“Indiana’s goalie played a great game,” senior 

fullback Halle O’Neill said. “I mean, we had 29 

shots on goal and we only put in three, so I think 

she played out of her mind. When you’re getting 

opportunities like that, eventually a couple of 

them will go in and it doesn’t have to be pretty — 

but pulling out three goals 

when they played like that 

I think is still a good accom-

plishment.”

Michigan extended its 

lead with a third goal in the 

fourth quarter, notching a 

score off of a tip from the 

penalty corner by senior 

midfielder Kayla Reed. 

With an urgency to pre-

pare for bigger things ahead, the Wolverines 

sought to continue cleaning up their finishes on 

the attacking end in the closing minutes. While 

junior goalkeeper Anna Spieker never had to 

touch the ball, occasional chances to sharpen up 

on defense also emerged.

As the clock hit all zeros, Michigan sent its 

seniors off celebrating with the best parting gift 

possible: a Big Ten regular-season title. And in a 

hard-fought battle to find the scoring column, its 

tendency to stiff-arm adversity was at the center 

of it all.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

Michigan’s senior class has celebrated three regular-
season Big Ten titles during its four years in Ann Arbor, 
the last of which was clinched on Saturday night. 

SportsMonday: What we have

The last picture I have on my phone from 

inside The Michigan Daily newsroom is of 

a computer screen. I was laying out the last 

newspaper I ever made there. The headline 

on the top banner of the sports section reads, 

“THE END.”

In a normal place, with 

normal people, exporting 

that sports section at 1:05 

a.m. would’ve been the 

end for me too. I would 

have shut down the 

computer, gone home and 

retreated into months of 

quarantine.

But because The Daily is The Daily, that day 

— the day the world stopped — became one of 

my favorite college memories. For hours, long 

after the paper had been sent to the printer, we 

danced on tables, played cards and belted out 

Electric Love. One kid, who I’ll only name as 

Chunks, spent the evening eating cardboard 

and wearing an empty case of Bud Light over 

his head. The seniors hugged and cried, and I 

did too, because I knew it would be my last time 

seeing any of them as college students.

If I had been a little more prescient, I would 

have known to soak up the memories and take 

a picture or two for myself. Back then, though, 

we all assumed we’d be in the newsroom by 

September. So this week, when I went back to 

remember that night, I found my camera roll 

barren. The next photo after that last picture of 

InDesign is of an empty campus the next day, 

our new reality having already set in.

And yet, a year later, I’m not particularly 

upset I don’t have any pictures from that night. 

The memories and the friendships don’t need 

to be immortalized on a phone screen. I’ll 

remember them forever regardless.

As I searched for manufactured memories 

for this column, that’s the lesson I realized. 

None of the group pictures and planned events 

are what I’ll remember from college a decade 

from now. 

What I’ll remember is jumping in the 

Huron River in the middle of the night, soaked, 

shivering and laughing with my best friends. I’ll 

remember stuffing 11 people in a sedan on the 

way back from Denny’s because we didn’t want 

to pay for an Uber. I’ll remember going sledding 

in kayaks long after production had ended, even 

though I had an 8:30 the next day.

None of those moments fill up my camera 

roll or social media feeds. Just as importantly, 

none were planned more than a few minutes in 

advance.

As much as anything, that befits the last four 

years. For just about every freshman, going off 

to college is accompanied by some big dream 

manifested throughout their high school years.

For me, that dream was to major in statistics 

and work in an MLB front office. A major reason I 

chose to go to Michigan was its extracurriculars, 

but I was more focused on the sports analytics 

club than the student newspaper. 

Fortunately, my freshman year roommate 

joined the section, so I followed his lead and 

went to a mass meeting. But even when I 

started writing regularly as a freshman, 

eventually covering the baseball team, I never 

envisioned this. 

That summer, I had a conversation with 

Rian, a friend I’d met at The Daily, predicting 

our futures at the paper. I told him I was 

hopeful for a spot on the hockey beat, but that 

after sophomore year, I’d have to devote my 

attention to pursuits beyond journalism. He 

wanted to cover men’s basketball as a junior 

and football as a senior. 

Three years later, we’re still good friends. 

He’s been a fantastic editor but decided to 

pursue a career outside of journalism and 

didn’t do a beat after sophomore year. Instead, 

over the next few months, I was the one who 

fell headfirst into the career he had ordained 

for himself.

By my second semester, I was spending 

every moment I could at The Daily. I learned 

this strange “euchre” game I had never heard 

of. Even if it usually ended with Paige sticking 

a pair of 5s on her forehead in celebration, I 

played because it was an excuse to hang out 

with my new friends until the sun came up.

That spring will forever be the time I most 

associate with college. If, 70 years from now, I 

look back on it as the best time of my life, I won’t 

regret a thing.

But, like everyone in my grade, my college 

years will forever be inextricably tied to 

COVID-19. It’s easy now, with two weeks until 

graduation, to think about what the pandemic 

took from us. The Rick’s pushes we didn’t 

have, the stories we never told, the nights of 

production forced onto Zoom. 

Instead, though, I find myself thinking 

about what The Michigan Daily gave me 

over the past year. When online school felt 

meaningless, this job gave me a purpose. As 

a writer, I was able to tell the stories that gave 

Michigan fans an escape. As a leader of the best 

goddamn student sports section in the country, 

I was able to provide an outlet for freshmen 

entering an overwhelming campus with no 

in-person means of making friends.

On a personal level, The Daily gave me the 

group of eight friends that we turned into a 

social bubble from September to April. It may 

not have been the year anyone envisioned, but 

we laughed at Love It or List It, withstood some 

earth-shaking back cracks and got to watch 

Jared shotgun a Truly in Joe Pleasant’s name. 

And together, we got through it. As of 

this week, all nine of us are at least partially 

vaccinated. The end is finally in sight.

Equally close is the end of my college career. 

It would be easy to focus on that instead. The 

future is a scary thing. I’d be lying if I said I 

knew everything it holds.

It’d be easy, too, to focus on the year we 

didn’t have. When I look back on my camera 

roll, there won’t be photos from senior year 

inside 420 Maynard or at my last State News 

game. But I’ll always have the NYPD runs and 

the kayaking trips, the empty stadiums and the 

packed rental cars.

And that’s even better.

SportsMonday: Walls, memories and what The Daily means

Last October, Theo Mackie and I got 

invited to the newsroom one Friday morning 

to unpack boxes. It was great to get back in the 

building, but felt a little 

wrong that we needed 

someone to open a locked 

door to access a place that 

we spent most of college. 

That compounded once 

we got inside.

By 
some 
awful 

coincidence, The Daily 

redid its roof last summer, 

which meant that as we all sat locked in our 

homes, the newsroom had to be stripped bare 

of its personality. The posters and random odes 

to inside jokes long forgotten were packed in 

boxes, to avoid anything getting ruined by 

falling dust and debris. 

We were supposed to be there to do our best 

to put it back together.

I stressed about the cork boards next to the 

sports desk and the posters that went nearby. I 

wanted it to look and feel the same, but I could 

just draw from my memory. I taped Kevin 

Santo’s old ID to the cork board, next to Jake 

Lourim’s notebook and the Santa hat Tien Le 

took from Madison Square Garden. No one 

who returns there in the fall will have any real 

connection with those items, but part of me still 

worries they’re in the wrong place, next to the 

wrong thing.

I’d try to explain the significance of that, but 

that would require explaining the significance 

of The Daily. And despite having spent the last 

three years daydreaming about what I’d write 

in this column while bored in class or in the 

car, I’m still really struggling to do that. It’s less 

something I can articulate, but rather than a 

flood of memories crashing down. 

Nervous emails to Kevin and Betelhem 

Ashame and Max Marcovitch about joining 

months before school started, quickly fast-

forwarded to two years later, dropping 

everything to meet Max at Hunter House in 

the middle of the day to piece together an atom 

bomb dropped in the middle of our first month 

as Managing Sports Editors. A 3 a.m. phone 

call from Tien — “come play basketball” — then 

migrating to West Quad to hang out with Lily 

until the sun came up. Drives through the 

night that bleed together, with Max and Mike 

Persak, with Theo and Aria Gerson. Waiting 

for the building to clear out as production 

wound down so we could sit and play euchre 

until Paige set her timer to go home. Tapping 

idiots on the shoulder at a party and telling 

them to come to The Daily so maybe they’d 

eventually understand this place the way I do. 

Coming out of the closet and having my worst 

fears dissolve.

I never expected The Daily to be any of that 

for me. It was supposed to be a way to advance 

my career, to do sports journalism. The Daily 

would help get me there, and in the meantime 

I’d stay holed up in my room watching games. 

That was my plan for college. A standing 4 p.m. 

Sunday meeting was, at best, an inconvenience 

to be worked around. If I walked quickly, I 

could get back for kickoff of the next window 

of football games.

Then something funny happened. I 

started skipping NFL Sundays — and if you 

knew me at all at that age, you’d know that 

wasn’t a thing I ever did. I once made my 

poor mother drive an eight hour round trip in 

one day instead of staying the night because 

the place we were going didn’t have access 

to watch Monday Night Football. But here 

I was, at 5 p.m. on a Sunday, sitting at the 

sports desk with my back to the television, 

not caring about what I was missing.

When they ran for MSE, Mike and Orion 

Sang said they wanted The Daily to be a place 

people went when they didn’t need to be there, 

to do homework or just hang out. I took that to 

the greatest extent I could and started showing 

up every night. It was one of the best decisions 

I ever made, because the best memories 

originated from when I didn’t have to be there.

It was a little bit tempting to write this 

column about the pandemic, and I think 

there’s a part of every kid in college right now 

(or at least those among us with the extreme 

privilege that COVID-19 hasn’t touched our 

lives in a more direct way) that will always 

feel bitter over losing some percentage of the 

best time in our lives. But my overwhelming 

emotion from the last 13 months is a deep 

appreciation for everything I had in college 

beforehand, the memories I’ll always hang 

onto and those I made this year because of 

friends I met at The Daily. 

One of my fears is that, post-COVID-19, 

The Daily will change into a place people don’t 

go unless needed. Zoom is convenient. So is 

cutting down on print, doing less work and 

staying in so you can watch football or catch up 

on school. Caring about the minute details of 

the items surrounding the sports desk feels like 

a manifestation of that fear. 

I want people to get out of The Daily what I 

got out of The Daily, and that’s at least a small 

part of it I can control.

But that fear is, of course, completely 

irrational. The Daily works because people 

who come into it get more than just a place 

to build a resume, and nothing will change 

that. Whether the sports desk looks right 

to me or not doesn’t matter, because when 

people come back to the building and make 

their own memories, it will look right to 

them. 

And it will always look like home.

Danny Zimmerman stepped up 

to the plate with the bases loaded 
during the Michigan baseball 
team’s game against Minnesota 
on Friday. The redshirt junior 
outfielder launched his second 
home run of the game, this one over 
the fence in deep left field to make 
the score 14-2, as the Wolverines 
broke open the game and went on 
to win 21-5.

Thanks in large part to a 

plethora of home runs, Michigan 
(18-7 Big Ten) swept Minnesota 
(4-20) this weekend, winning 4-0 
on Saturday and 9-5 on Sunday 
after its rout to open the series 
on Friday. Following its weekend 
performance, the Wolverines sit 
just a half-game behind Nebraska 
in the race for the Big Ten title and 
lead the Big Ten in home runs with 
33.

Michigan used the long ball 

several times this weekend, racking 
up eight home runs in three games. 
Especially on Friday, the home run 
ball was a theme throughout the 
game. 

“We just did a good job of 

swinging at good pitches and the 
wind was blowing out, so we hit 
five home runs,” Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich said. “Everything was 
going well for us offensively.”

Several of these home runs 

played key roles in the wins this 
weekend. Sophomore infielder 
Ted Burton launched a huge 
two-run blast in the ninth inning 
of Saturday’s game to put the 
Wolverines up 2-0, and they added 
two more runs to ultimately take 
the game, 4-0. Fifth-year transfer 
Benjamin 
Sems 
launched 
an 

important two-run shot to push the 
score to 5-2 en route to Michigan’s 
Sunday win. 

Sems 
was 
one 
of 
several 

Michigan players who had a strong 
series offensively, leading the way 
for the Wolverines with five hits 
and a walk. Burton collected four 
hits and eight RBI in the series, 
including his big two-run homer 
Saturday. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 

outfielder Jordon Rogers also 
collected four hits and three walks, 
while sophomore outfielder Clark 
Elliott chipped in with four hits 
and four walks.

“(What made us effective was) 

eliminating their pitches, just 
sitting off, laying off the off-speed 
and hitting the fastball,” Rogers 
said. “We’re a good hitting team 
when we are all locked in and I 
think this weekend we were. It was 
a good example of that.”

On the mound, Michigan got 

several strong starts out of its 
rotation. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 

left-hander Steven Hajjar allowed 
two runs over five innings in the 
opener and left the Wolverines 
well 
in 
control. 
Sophomore 

right-hander Cameron Weston 
had a very strong outing in 
Michigan’s second game, tossing 
seven scoreless innings to give 
his offense a chance to get going 
after a slow start. In the finale on 
Sunday, sophomore left-hander 
Jacob Denner went a solid five 
innings and gave up two runs.

“Our 
starting 
pitchers 
are 

pitching amazing this year,” junior 
right handerWillie Weiss said. 
“They’ve all been going deep into 
games, doing everything that we 
can ask for. I’m super proud of 
all the pitchers, all the starting 
pitchers and I am looking forward 
to watching them keep showing 
out.”

Out of the bullpen, junior 

right-hander Willie Weiss was 
lights-out for the Wolverines. 
The Michigan closer came into 
the 
game 
on 
Saturday 
with 

Minnesota threatening. With the 
score knotted at zero, the Golden 
Gophers had the bases loaded and 
just one out. But Weiss came in and 
shut the door, striking out all five 
batters he faced to end the threat in 
the eighth and close out the ninth. 
In Sunday’s finale, Weiss was again 
excellent, tossing the last four outs 
out of the bullpen.

“It’s 
a 
very 
good 
feeling, 

knowing that we have a consistent 
guy who can come in and close the 
door, even in close games,” Rogers 
said of Weiss. “It’s just an amazing 
feeling on defense, just knowing 
that he’s going to get outs.”

The Wolverines were expected 

to do well against a Minnesota 
team that sits in last place in the 
Big Ten. But winning on the road is 
always difficult, and Michigan was 
without the services of sophomore 
infielder Jimmy Obertop, who hits 
out of the cleanup spot. Despite 
missing a key piece, the Wolverines 
took care of business and swept the 
Golden Gophers.

“It was a huge sweep coming 

off taking two of three, getting 
the series win against Ohio State,” 
Weiss said. “It was nice to see us 
stay hot, keep the bats going and 
keep the momentum going into 
this weekend.”

Thirteen months ago, Michigan 

ended its season with a loss to No. 
1 Oklahoma. At the time, the fifth-
ranked Wolverines expected to 
face the Sooners again in the NCAA 
Championships. A week later, those 
expectations disappeared, along with 
the rest of their season.

“Our whole theme or motto for 

this season is ‘unfinished business,’ ” 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki told The 
Daily on Jan. 16. “We had a really 
good team and season last year that 
was pulled out right from under us.”

Saturday, No. 4 Michigan ended 

its season with a win over No. 1 
Oklahoma. And No. 6 Utah and 
No. 1 Florida. And the rest of the 
country. The team became national 
champions, the first in the program’s 
history and first for Michigan 
athletics since men’s gymnastics won 
in 2014.

This championship came in a year 

mired in conflict and obstacles. A 
sport that already requires impeccable 
discipline asked for more — off the 
mats and on them. That was part of 
the bargain made for this season, and 
this team followed it to a tee.

“It is incredibly difficult to take 

away an 18 to 21-year-old’s social 
life, and that’s essentially what has 
happened,” Plocki said Jan. 16. “They 
have handled it, they have dealt with 
it because this team and this season is 
a priority to us. Every single person 
is all in terms of doing what we need 
to do to reduce the possibility of this 
season ending prematurely again.”

A 
two-week 
pause, 
though, 

wasn’t a part of that bargain. Two 
meets into the season and it already 
appeared it could end before ever 
really beginning. The hard work 
and discipline, the win over No. 4 
Minnesota so early in the season, 
would amount to nothing.

But the season returned, and with 

it an ascendant Wolverine squad. 
After its first loss at the Big Five 
Meet, Michigan scored 198.025 in a 
dominant performance that broke its 
record score. The next week, a new 
record took its place at 198.100.

The 
Wolverines’ 
vault 

performance reached a new level 
with every score over 9.9 in a victory 
against Maryland. Its season high 
reached a shocking 49.800, and it 
became the best team in the country 
on the vault.

“At the beginning of the year 

we were doing big vaults, but we 
couldn’t get the landings, and it was 
just a process,” Plocki said after 
winning the championship. “We 
absolutely peaked at the right time 
this year. We started right before the 
championship part of the season, we 
started being able to nail those 1.5s 
and that’s when people started taking 
notice of us too.”

The week after setting the new 

program high against the Terrapins, 
another low point appeared. For the 
first time since 2013, Michigan didn’t 
win the Big Ten Championship. A 
score of 197.425 fell three tenths 
short of No. 8 Minnesota’s mark, a 
poor floor score that doomed the 
Wolverines. It wasn’t the first time 
floor brought the score down — in 
their only other loss in the season, 
Michigan scored a 47.500 on floor.

But the disappointment of losing 

its iron-clad grip on the conference 
didn’t last long.

“When we did not win the Big 

Tens, I said to my team right then and 
there, ‘We’re gonna trade in a Big Ten 
Championship ring for a National 
Championship ring this year,’ ” Plocki 
said. “And I think that that’s when it 
really got serious.”

Michigan didn’t lose a meet 

through the rest of the NCAA 
Tournament, matching its program 
high once again in the Regional Final. 
Its vault led the way, naturally. And 

throughout the run, the floor held its 
own. 

In the National Championship, 

Michigan 
— 
ranked 
twelfth 

nationally on floor — beat out the No. 
1, No. 4 and No. 6 floor teams in the 
country with a score of 49.625.

Going into the final rotation, the 

Wolverines held a lead of 0.1375 over 
Oklahoma. 

One last obstacle lay in between 

them and euphoria: the beam, an 
event they struggled on in the NCAA 
Second Round. The high-stakes 
event often sees low scores because 
every misstep and wobble may end 
up with a fall. 

First, sophomore Gabby Wilson, 

who averages a 9.809 on beam, 
wobbled — her final score a 9.75. Next 
in the lineup, senior Lauren Farley, 
who grew up an hour from the arena, 
also wobbled. Her final score of 
9.7625 was kept.

Just like that, Michigan lost 

their edge. From here on out, every 
routine would mean victory or loss.

And then, excellence.
“I think I knew those routines 

were semi off, but I also trusted 
myself and the rest of the lineup, 
so I was (thinking), ‘Get out there, 
do my thing,’ ” sophomore Sierra 
Brooks said. “I got on the beam and 
I just honestly approached it with 
as much confidence as I could ever 
have.”

A 9.9625 from Brooks and a 9.9875 

from junior Natalie Wojcik put the 
title back in reach.

All eyes in the arena then fell 

on junior Abby Heiskell. A season 
riddled with conflict, detours and 
sacrifice was now one routine away 
from glory, one routine away from 
despair.

And 
as 
Oklahoma 
watched 

on, hoping for one last wobble, 
Heiskell 
executed. 
Determined 

and disciplined, as this team has 
been all season, the 2021 National 
Championship was secured.

Michigan fifth-year outfielder Christan Bullock played a part in the 
monstrous offensive display against Minnesota.

ORLANDO 
— 
As 
Michigan 

sophomore Caiden Baxter battled 
it out against Alabama’s Lauren 
Haneke-Hopps, 
suspense 
filled 

the air. The crowd reacted to each 
point emphatically, with the two 
sets of fans taking turns bellowing 
out chants of school pride. Baxter’s 
normally cheerful on-court persona 
became gradually replaced with a 
fixated, stoic expression.

This was by far the biggest match 

of Baxter’s young career so far — the 
finals of the team competition at 
Wheelchair Tennis Nationals. He 
had been thrown into this position, 
selected to fill the shoes of the 
spectating graduate student Spencer 
Heslop, who set the tournament 
alight with an undefeated record but 
sat out the team final for religious 
reasons. Competing against a player 
with a far superior rank, winning 
this match would forever solidify the 
Baxter name in Michigan Adaptive 
Sports and Fitness lore.

Quickly, however, the match 

became meaningless. 

Baxter and partner Chris Kelley 

had already lost the doubles match 
against Alabama’s Thomas Venos 
and Jeremy Boyd, despite getting out 
to a hot start. While this result wasn’t 
unexpected, it meant the pair would 
have to win both of their singles 
matches against Alabama to secure 
the title. Kelley’s chances were high, 
but Baxter would have to play to the 
very best of his abilities for the entire 
match in order to have a chance. 

For much of the match, Baxter 

did just that. He served expertly, 
flustering Haneke-Hopps early on 
with a number of aces. Crucially, 
Baxter reeled in his inconsistency, 
leaving it to Haneke-Hopps to make 
the first mistake. 

Defying expectations, Baxter took 

the first set 6-4.

But at that point, the title was 

already 
Alabama’s. 
Putting 
his 

strength on full display, Venos had 
quickly overpowered Kelley. From 
start to finish, Venos dictated the pace 
of the match, smashing return after 
return past the exhausted Kelley. In 
dominant fashion, Venos won, 6-1, 6-2, 

securing Alabama’s fourth consecutive 
wheelchair tennis trophy. 

Despite the most significant set 

win of his career, Baxter quickly 
learned that the outcome of his match 
would mean nothing for Michigan’s 
title aspirations. But for the team, 
regardless of the outcome, this match 
mattered for far more. 

“We started this program within 

the past year,” Dr. Feranmi Okanlami, 
the director of Michigan’s Adaptive 
Sports and Fitness program, said. 
“Being here at all was step one. And 
look at everything we came away 
with: Three academic all-Americans, 
a sportsmanship award, two second-
place finishes — you can’t really ask 
for more than that.”

At the tournament, Michigan 

was very much the new kid on the 
block. The team had only recently 
gained enough facility access to 
begin practicing with each other 
regularly. A number of the team’s 
athletes had never participated in a 
competitive event before, and many 
had chalked Michigan off before the 
play even began. Countless hours 
of meetings, planning, training and 
negotiating had gone into making the 
establishment of this program and 
this team a reality. 

“For these athletes, to be (at 

Nationals) after being asked to be 
student-athletes, 
development 

officers, strategic planners, business 
moguls — they’ve had to do everything 
to run this program,” Okanlami said. 
“I have no words to truly say how 
proud I am of this group and of all the 
supporting staff that have allowed us 
to become what we are right now and 
what we hope to be in the future.”

Even before Michigan advanced 

to the finals, people were beginning 

to take notice of the waves the 
program 
made 
in 
Orlando. 

Throughout the tournament, a 
number of spectators, coaches and 
players stopped by the Michigan 
section to compliment the team and 
express how impressed they were 
with the speed at which Michigan’s 
program had grown. 

The 
program’s 
social 
media 

engagements ballooned, receiving 
engagements 
from 
numerous 

Michigan 
alumni, 
members 
of 

Michigan’s Varsity Tennis team 
and, crucially, Michigan Athletics. 
Michigan’s Adaptive Sports and 
Fitness 
program 
was 
building 

something special, and people were 
beginning to catch on. 

“I think that this (weekend) will 

provide some context and some 
inspiration for the institution to see 
what this group has been able to 
accomplish,” Okanlami said. “We 
don’t want recognition just because 
we want to be able to pat ourselves 
on the back, but because we want 
to be able to get access for the next 
group of students who want to 
compete alongside us at a University 
of Michigan that is supportive for 
students with disabilities.” 

Despite a truly valiant effort, 

Baxter would go on to lose his 
match in a tiebreaker. Okanlami, 
too, fell just short in his Tier 3 final, 
narrowly bested by Arizona’s Owen 
Anketell in a thrilling third set 
tiebreaker. 

For now, Michigan would have 

to settle for runner-up. But along 
the way, the team had accomplished 
far more than a trophy — or a “shiny 
tennis dinner plate,” as Spencer 
Heslop dubbed it — could ever give 
them.

Penn State’s 4th quarter surge too much for Michigan

For the Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team, it came down to the last three 
seconds. 

After a 14-12 victory against Penn 

State on March 20, the Wolverines 
(2-7 Big Ten) looked to repeat its 
performance against the Nittany 
Lions (3-6) on Friday in Happy 
Valley, Pa. Penn State, however, 
managed to pull off a fourth-quarter 
comeback and send the game to 
overtime, where it eventually scored 
with just three seconds left to win, 
14-13. 

The first quarter was evenly 

matched, as each team notched three 
goals. Thanks to strong defensive 
efforts and excellent goaltending, it 
was very difficult for either to create 
separation on the scoreboard.

In the second quarter, Michigan 

forced 11 turnovers compared to 
Penn State’s two, which provided 
offensive 
opportunities. 
Junior 

defenseman Andrew Darby forced 
a turnover late in the second quarter, 

allowing the Wolverines to clear the 
ball and to set up a scoring play. 

The Wolverines led 7-6 at 

halftime. 

Penn State switched goalkeepers 

during the second half which initially 
gave Michigan another opening. The 
Wolverines proceeded to go on a 5-1 
scoring run in the third quarter to 
make it a 12-8 Wolverine lead.

“Penn State went with a different 

direction for their goaltender, and 
when you put a guy in who has not 
played yet and it is cold, it is hard for 
him to get into rhythm,” Michigan 
coach Kevin Conry said. “We 
exploited him with good shots in 
good spots.”

The Wolverines, however, were 

unable to keep up the momentum 
heading into the fourth quarter, as 
Penn State scored five unanswered 
goals to take the lead with under 
five minutes left in the game. The 
Nittany Lions picked up the pace 
defensively by playing in a tight zone, 
which allowed for minimal shooting 
opportunities.

“They dropped into a zone and 

really packed it in which had our 

guys take some outside shots, and 
we were fortunate (sophomore 
midfielder) Jacob (Jackson) scored 
one at the end,” Conry said. “But 
for a lot of them, Penn State was 
able to get bodies on us, and we 
were not putting them to the pipes 
which allowed them to take a better 
position which really cut down a lot 
of our opportunities.” 

Michigan scored with just under 

three minutes left in regulation to 
force overtime. While in overtime, 
the Wolverines were in the offensive 
zone twice and created many scoring 
chances, but Penn State goalkeeper 
Aleric Fyock made arguably two of 
the best saves of the game, allowing 
the team to clear the ball and set up 
offensive plays.

Key 
contributors 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offensive 
included 

sophomore attackman Josh Zawada, 
who tallied a goal and three assists, 
and freshman attackman Michael 
Boehm who knotted a hat trick. 

With just three seconds left in 

overtime, Nittany Lions’ senior 
attackman Mac O’Keefe scored the 
game-winning goal, finishing with 
six tallies on the day. O’Keefe was 
able to create separation against the 
Michigan defenders allowing him to 
take an easy shot with no traffic in 
front of the net. Penn State squeaked 
out a one-point win, but even more 
impressive was O’Keefe breaking the 
NCAA’s all-time goal-scoring record 
in this game against Michigan. 

“Making good decisions down 

the stretch is a part of our maturation 
process,” Conry said. “So, every 
time that we are out there, we are 
learning and growing. It is certainly 
disappointing to lose a lead, but at the 
end of it, we had our opportunities to 
win the game.”

Despite holding a three-goal lead heading into the fourth quarter, Michigan fell to 
Penn State in overtime.


The 2021 gymnastics National 

Championship came down to the 
very last routine of the meet. Junior 
Abby Heiskell stared down the beam 
as she mounted it. As she performed 
her routine, she completed each skill 
with an intention to do it perfectly, 
a lesson Michigan coach Bev Ploc-
ki has drilled into the mind of her 
gymnasts all season. Heiskell showed 
no ounce of doubt in any of her skills, 
and when she finished the routine 
with a stuck dismount, she proved 
that she was capable of being there 
for her team in the moment it needed 
it most.

Heiskell, joined by her teammates, 

could not peel their eyes from the 
scoreboard, and neither could Okla-
homa. Waiting for only junior Ol-
ivia Trautman’s score on floor and 
Heiskell’s score on beam, the teams 
sat tied at 198.0750. Trautman’s score 
came in at a 9.9375, leaving Heiskell’s 
routine to need a score of 9.8500 or 
better to win the meet for the Wol-
verines. 

When the number came in on the 

scoreboard, a 9.9250, the team, the 
coaches and the fans erupted. Mich-
igan would be the 2021 National 
Champion, the first Michigan wom-
en’s gymnastics team to ever win a 
National Championship. The team 
clinched a program record 198.2500 
in the competition of its life. 

“We’ve talked about this for so long, 

and we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, this 
is actually happening. Oh my gosh, 
the meet is over, and we’re nation-
al champions,’ ” sophomore Sierra 
Brooks said. “So much went into this, 
it’s so amazing seeing our hard work 
pay off.”

Michigan clinched the win, in the 

end, by securing the lead they held 
onto the entire meet. Coming into 
the Finals, Oklahoma was ranked 
first and Michigan second, based on 
the semifinal scores, but the Sooners 
were never given a chance to shine. 

Michigan started the meet on floor 

with six strong routines, all counted 
scores at a 9.9125 or higher. Junior 
Natalie Wojcik led the pack, scoring 
a 9.9500, landing all of her tumbling 
passes smoothly and without fault. 
Sophomore Gabby Wilson also post-

ed an impressive score of 9.9375, and 
the solid performance from the rest 
of her teammates landed the Wolver-
ines at a 49.6250, only 0.0250 points 
short of their record floor score 
yesterday. 

Oklahoma’s start on vault left them 

trailing by 0.0500 to start the meet, 
a deficit they never overcame. Utah 
had a solid bars rotation as well, 
scoring a 49.4250. Florida, who, prior 
to the weekend, was seeded to place 
first, had two falls on the beam, forc-
ing the team to count one extremely 
low score that they would never 
recover from. 

Michigan carried their energy to 

the vault for the second rotation, 
where it was not only seeded first 
in the country, but had the highest 
team start value of any team in the 
competition, all vaults starting with 
a 10.0 start value. Heiskell began the 
event, sticking her one and a half 
Yurchenko, forcing the judges to 
search for any deduction. Her vault, 
and its score of a 9.9750 started the 
consistency of the event, which was 
followed up by another stuck vault 
from Wojcik, earning herself a 9.9375 
and Brooks, who notched a 9.9750. 
The team’s vault performance extend-
ed their lead over the rest of the field 
even further, gaining a 0.1375 lead 
over Oklahoma at the halfway mark.

“(Vault’s) just been amazing,” 

Michigan coach Bev Plocki said. “At 
the beginning of the year, we were 
doing big vaults, but we couldn’t get 
the landings, and it was a process. We 
absolutely peaked at the right time 
this year. … Right before the 
championship part of the 
season, we started 
being able to nail 
those 1.5s.”

Heiskell started 

off Michigan’s 
next rotation on 
bars with a stuck 
dismount. The 
Wolverines’ top 
scores of the 
rotation came 
from Brooks 
and junior Abby 
Brenner in her first 
competitive routine 
in months since 
hurting her ankle at 
the Big Five meet on 

Feb. 27. Their clutch performances 
earned both gymnasts a 9.9250, and 
kept Michigan with the same lead 
over Oklahoma as they had going 
into the event. 

This lead, though, was deceptively 

large. The Wolverines had to move 
to the beam, a nerve racking event to 
conclude a meet on, while the Soon-
ers ended on floor, whose scores were 
the highest of any event throughout 
the whole meet. Utah also trailed 
closely behind as they wrapped their 
meet up on the vault, another typi-
cally high scoring event.

“I just said to them: ‘Take a deep 

breath, exhale out all of the nervous 
energy and let’s just go do what we 
do, one routine at a time for six 
routines,’ ” Plocki said “We got this, 
breath in the confidence, be aggres-
sive. That’s what we wanted them to 
do, was just go do confident, aggres-
sive balance beam.”

Michigan’s rotation did not start as 

strong as they would have liked, with 
the highest of the first three routines 
coming from freshman Carly Bau-
man’s 9.8500. Wilson showed some 
wobbles, earning the lowest of the 
scores, a 9.7500. Meanwhile, Okla-
homa scored highly on the floor, 
all of which coming in at high 9.8s. 
However, Brooks turned the rotation 
around for the Wolverines. 

“Before I even went, I was on the 

verge of tears because I wanted it so 
bad for this team,” Brooks said. “I 
knew those routines were semi off, 
but I also trusted myself and the rest 
of the lineup, so I wanted to get out 

there and do my 

thing. I got on the beam and I just 
honestly approached it with as much 
confidence as I could ever have.”

Brooks performed her beam series 

perfectly, as well as the rest of her 
skills, all the way up to the stuck dis-
mount to score a 9.9625. The incred-
ibly high score made up for some of 
the points her former teammates had 
lost, but Wojcik and Heiskell still had 
to nail their routines for Michigan to 
have a shot at the win. 

Wojcik one-upped her teammate, 

sticking every skill just as solidly and 
scoring a 9.9875, the highest beam 
score of the day. Her score, along 
with the scores of the Sooners on 
floor, brought the meet to a tie before 
the very last routine of the competi-
tion. 

Heiskell handled the pressure with 

ease, flowing through each skill, 
punctuating her landings. Her skills 
on the beam, as well as her perfect-
ly stuck dismount off earned her a 
9.9250, well over the score the Wol-
verines needed to win the National 
Championship. 

“It’s very hard to describe how it 

feels,” Plocki said. “This is 32 years 
I’ve been waiting for this feeling … 
It’s just an unbelievable pride and 
just an admiration for what our team 
has been through and the sacrifices 
that they’ve made. I knew this was 
possible because, for the 
first time, they have 
belief in them-
selves.”
