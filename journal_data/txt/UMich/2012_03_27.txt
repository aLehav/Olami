Annual financial
analysis finds that
authority withheld
information'
By TAYLORWIZNER
DailyStaffXeporter
Though a financial audit of
the Ann Arbor Transporta-
tion Authority's 2011 finances
found that the organization was
financially sound, the document
alleged that AATA was in viola-
tion of federal labor law.
Last week, the AATA released
the results of its annual audit con-
ducted by public accounting firm
Plante Moran: The audit found
the AATA to be in violation of the
Davis-Bacon Act, which requires
contractors and subcontractors
for government-funded agencies
provide their employees with pay

rates comparable tothose of other
employers in the region.
Prevailing wage requirements
of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to
contracts in excess of $2,000.
Instead of apply-
ing theact to the 5.GXAk5
total work of a
contractor, the p
report allegedex
that the AATA ___
considered each
individual proj-
ect within a contract separately.
Therefore, all vendor payments
were under $2,000, relievingcon-
tractors from sendingtheir week-
ly certified payroll reports to the
AATA for monitoring of compli-
ance with the law.
Since the AATA failed to
review payroll reports from con-
tractors and subcontractors,
wage rates were not monitored
and therefore wage violations
could have gone unnoticed.

CALEA continues
0 assessment of DPS

PUT 'EM UP

Meeting held to
get public opinion
on campus police
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
The Commission on Accredi-
tation for Law Enforcement
Agencies held a public meeting
yesterday to hear comments
from the public regarding the
ge editation. of the Uni-
versity's Department of Public
Safety.
Dean Tondiglia, assistant
chief of the Kent State Univer-
sity Police Department and lead
assessor for CALEA, led the
ongoing assessment and evalu-
ation of DPS, along with Geof-
frey Ice of the Connecticut State
Police Academy Alumni Educa-
tional Foundation. For the past
two days, Todiglia and Ice have
been meeting with DPS staff,
reviewing internal procedure,
and riding along with DPS offi-
cers as part of the re-accredita-
tion process.
Three people attended the
public session today, including
former University Prof. Douglas
Smith. Smith told the assessors
that he had made a complaint at
the initial session in which DPS
was first accredited in 2009,
' alleging that the department
was in violation of federal law,
which required DPS to retain
a civilian oversight committee
- a regularly elected advisory
board of faculty and students

designed to make sugges-
tions for methods of discipline
againstpolice officers.
In 2009, the Michigan Daily
found that student seats on
the committee were often left
vacant and that both students
and faculty members of the
committee were often appoint-
ed illegally, since the members
of the committee needed to be
elected. The report led to sev-
eral reforms, including regular
elections of students and faculty
to the board.
Smith also referred to the
recent case of a six-month delay
in the reporting of the alleged
possession of child pornography
by former University of Michi-
gan Health System resident Ste-
phen Jenson. Citing this case and
others, Smith argued that there
is significant tension between
DPS and UMHS security.
"Basically, the campus police
and the hospital security hate
each other's guts," Smithsaid.
Linda Martinson, a former
Nursing student, also spoke at
the event. Martinson said she
spoke to assessors during DPS's
initial accreditation in 2009, but
because of a trespass warning
issued by the University, she
was forced to call in her com-
ments, rather than attend the
public session in person.
Martison claimed that DPS
officers who issued her trespass
warning refused to give her a
reason for the citation, which
forced her to withdraw from
the School of Nursing because

FEDERAL POLICY
Ryan budget
plan offers
new student
loan program
House Republicans
say federal aid
currently increases
government debt
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
In a budget plan to be voted
on in the U.S. Senate this week,
Republican leaders in the House of
Representatives proposed the recal-
culation of federal student loans to
increase transparency for taxpayers
and decrease national debt.
The plan - introduced by U.S.
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and
released last week - outlines a num-
ber of budget cuts as part of a method
for restructuring the national defi-
cit. Though Ryan's plan argues that
federal loans and subsidies currently
in place are not effective in lower-
ing the costs of higher education,
University officials are skeptical of
both the plan's implementation and
impact.
The proposal suggests a new cal-
culation for providing loans, which
eliminates certain avenues of fund-
ing and places caps on other areas.
Suggested cuts include in-school
interest subsidies, Pell Grant eligi-
bility for less-than-half-time stu-
dents and mandatory Pell Grant
funding. Cuts will "force schools to

President says
state plan doesn't
suit the University
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
Speaking before the Uni-
versity's lead faculty govern-
ing body yesterday, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
again publicly rebuked Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder's budget

proposal.
Under Snyder's proposed
budget, the University will
receive a 1.4 percent increase
in state support, and allotment
levels will be determined by a
system that measures factors
such as graduation rates and
affordability in comparison to
peer institutions in the state.
Snyder introduced the plan
last month, and Coleman has
vocally criticized the budget,
arguing that the governor's
formula isn't applicable to the

University.
"The metrics are based on
the expansion of graduates,"
Coleman told the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs. "They are based on met-
rics that aren't relevant to us."
Coleman said the formula
should provide greater weight
to a university's research and
graduate programs, rather than
focusing on improving gradua-
tion rates.
"Almost half of our students

20 years ago this week
(March 30,1992): The 1992 men's
basketball team, more commonly
known as the Fab Five, defeated
the Ohio State Buckeyes in over-
time to advance to the Final Four
of the NCAA Tournament.
Both Jimmy King and Jalen
Rose, members of the Fab Five,
said that while they were happy
with the Wolverines' advance-
ment to the Final Four, they
weren't fully satisfied yet.
"Right now, there's a feeling
of happiness, but not satisfaction
because our goals are beyond that
right now," Rose said, according
to The Michigan Daily.
The Wolverines proceeded to
reach the NCAA National Cham-
pionship, but fell to the Duke Blue

Devils 71-51.
40 years ago this week
(March 30, 1972): The Univer-
sity's Board of Regents rejected
two drafts of a plan designed to
create African-American Cul-
tural Living units in two campus
residence hall for the following
year, the Daily reported.
The board cited a fear of seg-
regation as well as legal barri-
ers as reasons for disapproval of
the plan, leaving 400 students
who expressed interest in such
communities disappointed. The
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
opposed the plan, according to
the Daily.
"We are opposed to the estab-
lishment of what amounts to sep-

arate living facilities for blacks,"
an NAACP official told the Daily.
60 years ago this week
(March 28, 1952): The East
Quadrangle Council rejected the
plan to house both women and
men in the East Quad Residence
Hall, shifting co-ed housing to
the South Quad Residence Hall
instead, the Daily reported.
East Quad President Earl
Aldon cited the plan's negative
effects on "the solidarity and
tradition" already established in
the all-male dormitory, the Daily
reported.
South Quad president Al War-
shawsky held similar sentiments
regarding the plan to shift women
into his dormitory.

Supreme Court begins to
hear health care case

Justices remain
unconvinced law's
penalties can be
classified as a tax
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court plunged into
debate yesterday on the fate of
the Obama administration's
overhaul of the nation's health
care system, starting with point-
ed questions about a legal issue
that could derail the case.
A decision is expected by late
June, in the midst of a presiden-
tial election campaign in which
all of President Barack Obama's
Republican challengers oppose
the law and promise its repeal
if the high court hasn't struck it
down in the meantime.
With demonstrators chanting
outside, eight of the nine justices
fired two dozen questions in less
than halfhour yesterday morning
at Washington attorney Robert
Long. He had been appointed by
the justices to argue that the case
has been brought prematurely
because a law bars tax disputes
from being heard in the courts
before the taxes have been paid.
Under the new law, taxpay-
ers who don't purchase health
insurance will have to report
that omission on tax returns for
2014 and will pay a penalty along
with federal income tax. At issue
is whether that penalty is a tax.
Some of the justices reacted
skeptically to the idea that the
penalties encapsulated in the
Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act were actually a
tax.
"What is the parade of hor-
ribles?" asked Justice Sonia Soto-
mayor, if the court decides that
penalties are not a tax and the
health care case goes forward?
Long suggested it could encour-
age more challenges to the long-
standing system in which the
general rule is that taxpayers
must pay a disputed tax before
they can go to court.

Outside the court building,
about 100 supporters of the law
walked in a circle holding signs
that read, "Protect my health-
care," and chanting, "Care for
you, care for me, care for every
family." A half-dozen opponents
shouted, "We love the Constitu-
tion!"
A four-person student band
from Howard University was
part of the group favoring the
law, playing' New Orleans-style
jazz tunes.
The law, much of which has
still to take effect, would require
almost all Americans to obtain.
health insurance and would
extend coverage to more than
30 million people who now lack
it. The law would be the largest
expansion in the nation's social
safety net in more than four
decades.
People hoping for a glimpse of
the action had waited in line all
weekend for the relatively few
seats open to the public. The jus-
tices allotted the case six hours
of argument time, the most since
the mid-1960s.
Nurses Lauri Lineweaver and
Laura Brennaman, who are com-
pleting doctoral degrees, had
been waiting since noon Sunday
and got tickets to see arguments.
"It's an honor to be in the court,"
said Lineweaver, 35.
The court will release audio
recordings of the arguments on
the same day they take .place.
The first time that happened was
when the court heard argument
in the Bush v. Gore case that set-
tIed the 2000 presidential elec-
tion. The last occasion was the
argument in the Citizens United
case that wound up freeing busi-
nesses from longstanding limits
on political spending.
Outside groups filed a record
136 briefs on various aspects of
the court case.
The first arguments yesterday
concern whether the challenge is
premature under a 19th century
tax law because the insurance
requirement doesn't kick in until
2014 and people who remain

uninsured wouldn't have to pay a
penalty until they file their 2014
income taxes in early 2015.
Taking this way out of the case
would relieve the justices of ren-
deringa decision in political high
season, just months before the
presidential election.
The biggest issue before the
court is today's argument over
the constitutionality of the indi-
vidual insurance requirement.
The states and the National
Federation of Independent Busi-
ness say Congress lacked author-
ity under the Constitution for
its unprecedented step of forc-
ing Americans to buy insurance
whether they want it or not.
The administration argues
Congress has ample authority to
do what it did. If its action was
rare, it is only because Congress
was dealing with a problem that
has stymied Democratic and
Republican administrations
for many decades: How to get
adequate health care to as many
people as possible, and at a rea-
sonable cost.
The justices also will take up
whether the rest of the law can
remain in place if the insurance
mandate falls and, separately,
whether Congress lacked the
power to expand the Medicaid
program to cover 15 million low-
income people who currently
earn too much to qualify.
If upheld, the law will force
dramatic changes in the way
insurance companies do busi-
ness, including forbidding them
from denying coverage due to
pre-existing medical conditions
and limiting how much they can
charge older people.
The law envisions that insur-
ers will be able to accommodate
older and sicker people without
facing financial ruin because of
its most disputed element, the
requirement that Americans
have insurance or paya penalty.
By 2019, about 95 percent of
the country will have health
insurance if the law is allowed to
take full effect, the Congressio-
nal Budget Office estimates.

U.S. President Barack Obama, left, chats with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during a bilateral meeting at the
Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, yesterday.
bama to Russia: More
fexibilityafter elections.

Comment picked
up by microphone
gives political
opponents fuel
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
President Barack Obama told
Russia's leader yesterday that he
would have more flexibility after
the November election to deal
with the contentious issue of
missile defense, a candid assess-
ment of political reality that
was picked up by a microphone
without either leader apparently
knowing.
Obama's Republican oppo-
nents pounced on the comment,
saying the president has a hid-
den agenda that could include
concessions to the Russians if he
is re-elected this fall.
"This is my last election,"
Obama is heard telling outgoing
Russian President Dmitry Med-
vedev. "After my election, I have
more flexibility."
Medvedev replied in Eng-
lish, according to a tape by
ABC News: "I understand. I

will transmit this information
to Vladimir," an apparent ref-
erence to incoming President
Vladmir Putin.
Obama and Medvedev did not
intend for their comments, made
during a meetingin Seoul, South
Korea, to be made public.
Once they were, the White
House said Obama's words
reflected the reality that domes-
tic political concerns in both the
U.S. and Russia this year would
make it difficult to fully address
their long-standing differences
over the contentious issue of
missile defense. Obama, should
he win re-election, would not
have to face voters again.
"Since 2012 is an election year
in both countries, with an elec-
tion and leadership transition
in Russia and an election in the
United States, it is clearly not a
year in which we are going to
achieve a breakthrough," White
House deputy national security
adviser Ben Rhodes said.
Obama's candid remarks
yesterday illustrated the politi-
cal constraints that hem in any
president who is running for
re-election and dealing with a

congressional chamber - in this
case, the House - controlled
by the rival party. Republicans
have fought Obama fiercely on
health care, taxes and other
issues. They are eager to deny
him any political victories in a
season in which they feel the
White House is within reach,
although Obama's remarks sug-
gested he feels good about his
re-election prospects.
Even if Obama was confiding
a political reality in a supposedly
private moment, the comments-
gave the GOP new openings to
question his sincerity and long-
range plans.
Mitt Romney, the leading
Republican contender to face
Obama this fall, told a San Diego
audience the unguarded com-
ments were "an alarming and
troubling development."
"This is no time for our presi-
dent to be pulling his punches
with the American people, and
not telling us what he's intend-
ing to do with regards to our
missile defense system, with
regards to our military might
and with regards to our commit-
ment to Israel," Romney said.

Detroit finances
deal progresses
A deal aimed at rescuing
Detroit before it goes broke
appeared imminent yesterday
after city and state negotiators
reported major progress in their
often-contentious talks and a
review panel appointed by Gov.
Rick Snyder decided not to rec-
ommend an emergency manager
to take over the reins of city gov-
ernment.
Snyder has 10 days to negotiate
a compromise with city officials,
but he and the City Council pre-
dictedthere would be a"financial
stability agreement" reached by
the end of the week. Regardless
of the final version, the compro-
mise being worked out wouldn't
strip nearly as much authority
from city leaders as the emergen-
cy manager process would.
"My role is not to run the city
of Detroit. My goal is for the state
to provide a supporting resource,
be a partner," the Republican
governor said. "Much of this
agreement is pretty far along. We
need to make some reviews. Both
the City Council and mayor need
to make some reviews."

Decades of sex
abuse uncovered
within Pa. church
The Archdiocese of Philadel-

in its ranks for more than 70
years, putting the church's repu-

a prosecutor said yesterday at the
start of a landmark priest abuse
case that's shaken the Roman
Catholic establishment.
The church kept secret files
dating back to 1948 that show
a long-standing conspiracy to
doubt sex abuse victims, protect
priests and avoid scandal, Assis-
tant District Attorney Jacqueline
Coelho said in opening state-
ments.
Coelho called the case "a battle

the archdiocese and the office of

Ontario's top court

A ban on brothels puts pros-

yesterday, in a case that is expect-

court and have ramifications for
the country at large.
The Ontario Court of Appeal
said sex workers should be
allowed to work safely indoors.
"The world in which street
prostitutes actually operate is
a world of dark streets and bar-
ren, isolated, silent places," said
the five-judge panel in their rul-

always the risk of violence and
even death."

The former Massachusetts
governor highlighted the ongo-
ing primary slog as the conser-
vative chorus behind him grew,
along with worry that the drawn-
out nomination fight will dam-
age their likely nominee against
President Barack Obama.
Campaigning in California,
Romney made an appeal to pri-
mary voters in a contest still two
months away on June 5. "I need
you guys to get ready, to organize

ber from another school as well
as students, staff members and

The committees will appoint

DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the low turnout may
be a good indicator of how the
public thinks of the department.
"I actually think (the small
turnout) says that people think

said. "People will come if they've
got a complaint to something like

contacted the University's Iraqi

"There was a lot of grief and
shock, and I think channeling
that into action was important
for me personally (because)
I felt almost paralyzed by it,"
Sajid said. "I think the reason
that University of Michigan

Rackham student Moham-

are obliged to raise awareness
about race-fueled tragedies.
"As human beings, I think

the plan.
"The decisions of colleges
and universities to raise their
prices would have been con-
strained if the federal govern-
ment had not stepped in so often
to subsidize rising tuitions," the
plan states.
Cindy Bank, assistant director
of the University's Government
Relations Office in Washington,
D.C., argued that'the plan has
very little chance of passing the
Senate, especially since Demo-
crats control the Senate.
"The plan won't pass in the
Senate as it is written (though
the University) is concerned
about any cuts to financial aid,"
Bank said.
Bank said in its current state,
the plan would not have an
immediate influence on the

posed cuts are more restricting
than the Budget Control Act,
which was passed in 2011 to
reduce national debt.

spoke at the event and said the
vigil not only allowed students
to process their grief by uniting
in a positive way, but also built
bridges between multiple com-
munities.
"It recognizes underlying
causes behind these deaths,
which is really just one cause
- and that's racism," Abdel-
hadi said. "This all comes back
to 'fear of the ther.' Both of
these events come back to peo-
ple of color's lives being at risk
... because of hatred, because of
stereotypes and because of this
environment that we have in
our country of xenophobia."
Abdelhadi said the event pro-
vided an opportunity to educate
the student body about impor-
tant racial issues.
"This event, it's not an iso-
lated incident," she said. "It's an
incident that highlights these
pent up tensions and these
problematic discourses that you
still see every day just turning
on the news."
LSA sophomore Margaret
Staeber said 'she attended the
event because she was disap-
pointed that such killings still
occur today.
"As a white female, I may
not have come against a lot of
the problems that other people
have," Staeber said. "But you
can all still band together and
really show why these things
aren't okay and why they never
should have been okay."
LSA junior Patrick Parkin-
son, a member of a coalition for
diversity, announced at the end
of the event that students will

ly - the specifics haven't been
described," Bank said. "It sets
caps for spending below those
set in the Budget Control Act,
and we don't have a sense yet oni
how those cuts will be applied."
Bank added that the budget
proposal does not consider the
expenses of privately provided
loans in its restrictions-on federal
programs.
"The proposal doesn't take
into account the expenses for
subsidies when private groups
administer loans," Bank said.
The plan will be debated in the
House today, and a vote is sched-
uled for Thursday. If passed, the
cuts will be implemented for the
governmental fiscal year, begin-
ning in October 2013.
In an e-mail interview, U.S.

approach college affordability.
"We need to make college
more affordable, not less,"
Levin wrote. "Protecting pro-
grams that help families send
their children to college is
vitally important, and I would
strongly oppose any of those
programs."

War's hidden tolls
Massacre opens talks of troops' mental health
n March 11, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales allegedly killed
17 Afghan civilians and wounded five others in what media
outlets are now labeling the Kandahar Massacre. Though
several of Bales's family members and colleagues initially expressed
disbelief at these accusations, new information has shed light on per-
sonal traumas that might have contributed to this heinous act. Clear-
ly, Bales should be held accountable as an individual, but that doesn't
address the whole problem. Recent reports of the events leading up
to the massacre - along with studies indicating that many veterans
of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from mental disorders -
reveal the need for new measures of psychological evaluation by the
military to prevent the recurrence of similar tragedies.


The victims' families said that by accepting the
money, it didn't mean that they forgave the killer."
- Deputy chairman of the Panjwai district council Fazal Esaqzai said yesterday about U.S. giving
$50,000 to families of victims of the recent massacre in Afghanistan, according to The Washington Post.
One year after Fukushima

Bales's family was "totally shocked" by
the accusations, according to a BBC profile.
Most oftheir accounts suggest that Bales had
his share of everyday struggles, but was oth-
erwise a-well-adjusted man. The complete
picture, however, is less serene. Over Bales's
11-year career in the U.S. Army, reports sug-
gest alcohol abuse, a misdemeanor assault
charge and domestic problems that threat-
ened his marriage. He suffered serious brain
trauma in one of two wartime injuries. More
disturbing still, Bales apparently witnessed
a fellow soldier's dismemberment, the con-
sequence of an attack that occurred only a
day before the massacre in which Bales is
implicated.
As a result, the embattled soldier's lawyer
will argue that the killings were in part the
result of military negligence. Bales claims
he was sent on a fourth tour of duty against
his will, which begs the question: How many
tours are too many? With a volunteer force,

it may be difficult for the military to find .
the appropriate number of troops to fight in
Afghanistan, but Bales's past and unwilling-
ness to serve another tour of duty necessi-
tated a more thorough psychological review
than he received.
Bales's case has also opened up a large-
scale discussion about the effects of war on
military culture as a whole. If convicted,
Bales should be ultimately held account-
able for his crime and serve the full penalty
afforded by the law. But the flurry of cover-
age surrounding Bales and the Army's role
in his crimes shouldn't overshadow the pos-
sibility for renewed foreign policy discussion.
Huffington Post blogger and vietnam veteran
John Graham suggests that the blame doesn't
rest solely on the instruments of war: "On
trial should be any of us who accept war as
an unavoidable part of our political landscape
and not as the last resort to protect national
interests that are vital, immediate and real."

year after a tsunami rav-
aged the Fukushima Daiichi
uclear Power Station, Japan
still struggles
to clean up the
aftermath of
one of the worst
nuclear accidents
in history.'"
The Fuku-
shima incident is
an ugly reminder JOE
that despite the SUGIYAMA
overwhelming
benefits nuclear
energy has to offer, the repercussions
of a meltdown can quickly outweigh
them. That being said, it would be
foolhardy to suggest that nuclear
facilities around the world should
be disassembled and abandoned as
a viable energy source. Countries
can use Fukushima as motivation
to implement more stringent laws
to protect their citizens from falling
victim to a nuclear disaster.
By the estimates of the Tokyo
Electric Power Company, owner of
the plant, the remediation of Fuku-
shima won't be complete for nearly
four decades - a process that will
cost Japan billions of dollars. This
doesn't include the cost of displacing
more than 300,000 people and quar-
antining asizable chunk of acreage in
a country where land is at a premium.
Some maysuggest that a 9.0 earth-
quake followed by a devastating tsu-
nami are circumstances that simply
couldn't have been planned for. This
mindset would render the Fukushi-
ma accident unavoidable as well, but
according to a March 9 article in The
New York Times, that might not be
the whole story.
It seems that the risk of a devas-
tating tsunami had been brought to
the attention of Japan's Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency. However,
the agency and Tepco failed to take
proper precautions that adhere to
international nuclear regulations.

Implementing an emergency
energy system could have prevented
the plant meltdown altogether. Such
systems have been utilized in Europe
for several years now, and Tepco
was "well aware" of Europe's strides
toward safer nuclear energy. The
entire event may have been avoided
with a little forward thinking.
Such forward thinking has been
the catalyst for the United States
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
recent policy changes. The NRC
has put in place provisions that will
require nuclear plants to have extra
monitoring systems in their spent-
fuel pools. They have also required
containment structures, which
would "help prevent or mitigate
core damage in the event of a seri-
ous accident."
Each of these orders has addressed
one of the shortcomings that led to
the plant meltdown in Japan. Such
a proactive approach by the NRC
will hopefully alleviate the concerns
surrounding nuclear energy, but it
should be noted that no amount of
precautionary measures can totally
eliminate the risks involved with
nuclear power.
That leads to an important ques-
tion: Is nuclear power worth it?
Right now, 65 nuclear power plants
account for approximately 20 per-
cent of the United States' total
energy market. From an energy
standpoint, our country needs
nuclear power to avoid becoming
even more dependent on fossil fuels.
However, there's no way to quantify
the cost of human lives that are put
at risk by these facilities. So what
should we do?
The solution that the NRC has
created plans to lower these risks of
nuclear meltdowns to an acceptable
level. There is practically no man-
made infrastructural item that
doesn't carry some risk of harming
humans. Everything from bridges
to buildings is designed with a cer-,

tain degree of uncertainty that can
be accounted for but not eliminated.
Engineers are trained to do
everything in their power to lower
these risk factors, but an 'Act of
God' - a term commonly used in
construction contracts - must
always remain as a possibility in the
minds of the designers.
Proactive safety
for nuclear plants
lessens concern.
With this, we must understand
that there will never be a totally 0
safe solution to nuclear power. We
must trust that the NRC standards
have lowered the risk of a nuclear
accident to an acceptable level. The
United States can't afford to lose
such a large contributor to its ener-
gy supply if it ever hopes to lower
its dependence on coal-fired power
plants, but the safety of American
lives must always be at the forefront
of the nuclear conversation. It isn't
too much to ask that the NRC and
their recent policy changes reflect
such a mindset.
Unfortunately, learning from
mistakes is a necessary step in pre-
venting future disasters - see Hur-
ricane Katrina. Yet, as devastating
as the Fukushima meltdown has
been to Japan, it has provided the
rest of the world with a warning
of the dangers of nuclear energy.
Hopefully, Fukushima will be the
last disastrous lesson needed in the
world of nuclear power.

has been, both Mr. Jao and

We live in an age of unprecedented innovation. In the
past eight years alone, we've witnessed the emergence
of technological breakthroughs such as Facebook, You-
Tube, Twitter, the iPhone and the iPad. Clean and alter-
native energy are becoming more prominent due to fiscal
and environmental concerns about our dependence on
oil, coal and natural gas. Innovation is everywhere and it
will continue to define our lives in the 21st century.
However, most of us aren't computer programmers
or chemical engineers. So how can we contribute to a
vibrant atmosphere of innovation without expertise in
a certain field? The answer: we can all write poems.
Innovation is all about seeing the world through
unique perspectives and creating something new
according to them. Similarly, poetry is all about cre-
ating one new image, phrase or shade of emotion that
only one person can imagine and bring into reality.
Innovation is driven by imagination and a sense of end-
less possibility. With poetry, the sky's the limit:
One driving force behind the success of late inno-
vation giant and Apple CEO Steve Jobs was his artis-
tic sensibility. In his 2005 Stanford commencement
address, Jobs described his enrollment in a calligraphy
class after he had dropped out of college, despite his
knowledge that the class did not have "even a hope of
any practical application" in his life at that time. How-
ever, Jobs said, "If I had never dropped in on that sin-
gle course in college, the Mac would have never had
multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts." If
we train ourselves to view the world from an artistic
perspective, the potential for innovation is endless.
All other forms of art can facilitate innovation, but
poetry is the most manageable art form for us to explore
within the constraints of our daily routines and responsi-
bilities. By the time we've finished learning a melodic line
on our musical instrument, considering the next event in
a short story's plotline or drawing a picture that isn't ter-
ribly deformed, we could have written several thoughtful
lines of poetry. We can all write poetry because we can
all write in the English language - that's all we need to
write a poem that's meaningful to us.
There are absolutely no rules governing poetry.
Someone can write three words and call it poetry. A
poem can be simple or even silly. People need to real-
ize that a poem doesn't need to have groundbreaking
insight or be written in any particular way to be con-

sidered "poetry." Writing poetry simply trains us to
view ourselves and our surroundings from a unique
or unconventional perspective. Innovation is all about
thinking "outside the box" and poetry is highly condu-
cive to that type of thought process.
Writing poetry also leads to self-fulfillment. When
we create something, it feels good. The goal of writ-
ing poetry isn't publication, fame or approval from our 0
peers. Instead, it's about viewing the world in a new
way - your own way - without any criticism or cyni-
cism. It's an exciting feeling to be completely free of
any logical or imaginative constraints. This is the type
of mindset that we need to develop if we're going to
innovate in the 21st century.
An artistic mindset is critical for modern innova-
tion, yet politics sometimes threatens to restrict our
ability tolexplore our artistic potential. Last January,
House Republicans proposed to cut $7.8 billion over
10 years from the National Endowment for the Arts,
the National Endowment for the Humanities and the
Corporation of Public Broadcasting, even though these
cuts represented only 0.3 percent of the proposed cuts.
In November, the Los Angeles Times reported that the
NEA and NEH each received only $155 million per year
in federal funding and were "among the smallest agen-
cy appropriations in the federal budget." Republican
presidential candidate Mitt Romney also has proposed
to cut federal funding for several agencies including
the NEA, NEH and CPB by half.
While funding for the arts has faded from the
national conversation in recent months, we must not
forget their importance in the context of national and
global innovation. Luckily, a pen, paper and an idea
do not cost much money, so we can still create a large *
amount of poetry in the meantime. However, other art
forms require more expensive supplies and funding for
programs that teach skills to create those types of art.
The proposed cuts to the arts reflect a lack of under-
standing about their enormous contribution to innova-
tion, which is deeply troubling in a country that prides
itself on progress.
We can be the world's nextgreat innovators if we view
the world from an artistic perspective. Writing poetry is
a valuable first step towards achieving thatgoal.

about M.I.A's
scandalous
antics. But it's Madonna
undeniable that MDNA
the paparazzi
are back in full Interscope
force patrolling
Madonna's every move. While
her new album, MDNA, sees
her reemerge onto the popular-
music scene, with collaborations
from more contemporary figures
such as Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.,
it doesn't justify all the scrutiny.
It's a lackluster musical effort,,
coming off more like a dumb pub-
licity stunt than anything with
character.
The beats underlying Madon-
na's voice are sparse and uninter-
esting productions. They seem to
combine hangovers from the'80s
and '90s with bass tactics more
characteristic of popular music
today. "Turn Up the Radio" is

a pop song that begins with an
evenly spaced synthesizer remi-
niscent of techno hits from the
'80s and eventually transitions
into the chorus, "Turn up the
radio," with a wash of bass much
like you would hear from a dub-
step song today.
It's not the combination of
musical genres that makes it bad
- obviously, great musicians do
this all the time with success.
Likewise, picking and choosing
from the past can be a source of
innovation for the future. But it
would be laughable to suggest
this album breeds invention. It
seems as if the tinny-sounding
beats were made in two minutes
from contemporary producers
who listened to some of Madon-
na's old hits and mixed them with
a bit of what we're used to listen-
ing to today.
"Gang Bang," the album's
second song, is a miserable
effort that truly epitomizes the
lack of musicality in this work.
Madonna is trying to sound like
a badass over a pumping beat
resembling the soundtrack of a
Nintendo Game Boy game. For
a song to prompt video game
nostalgia rather than apprecia-
tion for the actual production is
certainly bad news, and unfor-
tunately, Madonna does little in
the rest of the album to grab our
attention.

Her voice is an instrument
of annoyance throughout the
album, airily floating around the
corny beats. It fails to exhibit
any significant contrasts, and
she sounds like she's sing-
ing a bad lullaby instead of a
pop song most of the time. The
offensive simplicity of the back-
ground music demands Madon-
na to infuse some energy, but
she doesn't. Her voice seems
detached and childish. Are
we watching the intermediate
rounds of "American Idol," or
listening to one of the biggest
pop artists of all time? Where's
the energy? Not in MDNA.
The lone highlights of the
album come not from anything
Madonna'offers, but rather from
Nicki Minaj - whose charac-
teristic pizzazz generates some
welcomed energy in "Give Me
All Your Luvin' "- but the posi-
tive experience is over too soon,
and we are left with the bare,
bare bones of Madonna and silly
techno beats.
Considering Madonna's larg-
er-than-life celebrity status, it
would've been nice to justify it
with an engaging album. Instead,
we're left scratching our heads,
asking depressing questions
such as "why is this person so
famous?" and "why does our soci-
ety put her on a pedestal?" Sadly,
MDNA gives us no answers.

The first thing you should
know about Miike Snow is that
it's not one guy - it's a band
consisting of
Swedish pro-*
ducers Chris-
tian Karlsson Mike Snow
and Pontus
Winnberg Happy to You
and Ameri-
can vocalist Universal Repubic
Andrew Wyatt.
The second thing you need to
understand is they aren't afraid
to break their backs for their
music - after they released their
first, self-titled album in 2009,
they began touring and record-
ing, only pausing to rest on
Christmas Eve and Christmas.
The last thing - and this one's
the most important - is this is
not a band to-be taken too seri-
ously. With a name derived from
a Japanese director and a young
engineer they had only met
twice, the men of Miike Snow
are an offbeat team whose lat-
est album is unassumingly fan-
tastic.
The group's first LP was full
of poppy, mostly unmemorable
dance tracks, but its hits estab-
lished a loyal following and were
remixed by artists such as Fake
Blood, and Peter, Bjorn and John.
Not to mention, Miike Snow
worked with pop stars such as
Madonna and Britney Spears in
the past (you can thank or blame
Miike Snow for "Toxic"). Now
Miike Snow has created a Swed-
ish label called INGRID, which
the band used as a foundation to
release its second album Happy
to You.

AAR redefines its musical

Daily Arts Writer

Move Along, it has never failed
to produce one

to generate
watered-down music by aban-
doning style in an attempt to
please a more general audience.
AAR's previous album When the
World Comes Down showed, with
its success of "Gives You Hell"
and the overall radio-friendliness
of its other tracks, that the band
was very close to going in this
direction. After all, there's a fine
line between popularity and con-
formity.
But Kids in the Street aims to
show there is no need to measure
up to any previous mainstream
successes. Given that it's lacking
any of the obvious hits that have
come to be expected from the
group, this is perfectly accept-
able. The band remains true to
its style - with the exception of
some successful experimentation
- and the tracks aren't monoto-
nous.
More specifically, a few of the
tracks are shockingly differently
from any of AAE's other work.

Richie goes country
R&B star heads 1

Sporcle demonstrates
triviality o fmovie trivia

for home in new
release 'Tuskegee'
* By EDITH FREYER
Daily Arts Writer
Broadly speaking, the real-
ity is that most teenagers these
days don't know Lionel Richie as
anything more
than Nicole's *
papa. For those
who fit into Lionel Richie
that category,
here's a quick Tuskegee
history lesson:
He started his Universal
music career International
in the '60s as
a member of the funk group the
Commodores. He eventually
established himself as a solo art-
ist, recording mostly in the easy-
listening R&B-soul fusion genre.
Most recently, however, he has
taken a turn back down south-
ward into the country category.
His efforts to pay homage to his
hometown, Tuskegee, Ala., have
culminated in a 13-track album
of his re-imagined hits fittingly
titled Tuskegee. He spent the bulk
of his childhood in the Southern
town and clearly knows its music
well.
Let me be clear. This is no
R&B album with an intermittent
twang situation. There's no way
around it - this album is straight
up country. It's kind of surpris-
ing, considering Richie started
his career with Motown Records,
but like they say, you can take the
musician out of Alabama, but you
can't take the Alabama out of the
musician.
Every song on Tuskegee has
been written and produced by
Richie. He covers every aspect of
his songs' creation, and that level
of specificity with his music -
something that has always been

seemed way -
too easy. If
I were going to procrastinate,
I'd rather watch my roommate
build a skateboard ramp on the
corner of East University Avenue
and Hill Street (yes, my room-
mate builds skateboard ramps.
And yes, they're awesome) or
engage in a lively game of Penny
Can (for those who don't know
Penny Can, see ABC's "Cougar
Town" for more information on
this extraordinary time-killer).
But after learning about the vast
array of film quizzes available
- from movie quotes to actors'
last names - my interest was
sparked.
Myself and two other people
from our study group took a quiz
called 100 Tiny Movie Scenes,
which consisted of identifying a
title based off of a still image the
size of a fingerprint from that
movie. Within seconds, I was
losing. My competitors quickly
soared ahead, naming movie
after movie as though all they
needed to identify films such as
"The Shining" or "Up in the Air"
was a split-second glance at a
very, very tiny image. Something
had to be wrong. How had their
movie knowledge so effortlessly
surpassed mine?

back to the simple days of being
"kids in the street." Instead, the
emotions are scattered, making
things uncomfortably hot and
cold while going through the
album in listing order.
A smart move would have
been putting the song "Kids In
the Street" as the leading track,
because it immediately narrates
the overall theme of the album.
Of course, none of this affects the
quality of the record's content,
but as a whole, it needs more logic
with its message.
The album is sure to please
many fans of the band, if not
all the Top-40 listeners. Lyri-
cal originality, some shaken-up
material and the famous playful
rebellion of AAR creates a quality
album that shows the group has
nothing to prove.

BASEBALL
'M' faces EMU, Oakland

Junior center fielder Patrick Biondi has hit .458 during his current six-game hitting streak.
Outfielders settingthe table

for heart of the M'

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Patrick Biondi's job is plain
and simple.
"As a lead-off guy, my job is
to just get on base and let guys
like (sophomore right-field-
er) Michael
(O'Neill), NOTEBOOK
(senior catch-
er) Coley (Crank), and (freshman
left-fielder) Will (Drake) - in
the four-hole today - drive me
in," the junior center fielder said
on Sunday, after Michigan's 11-3
victory against Indiana-Purdue
Fort Wayne.
Biondi, who went 7-for-11 in
last weekend's series against
IPFW, has been red-hot over the
past two weeks. During his cur-
rent six-game hitting streak, he
has hit .458.
But it's not his batting aver-
age that has Michigan baseball
coach Rich Maloney singing his
praise. It's his ability to get on
base.
"He's the key to the offense.
Last weekend, he had a .500 on-
base percentage, and that's what
I look at," Maloney said. "I don't
care about your (batting) aver-
age -t'm looking at how many
times you're getting on base.
That's his job, and over the last
week or so, he's been doing a
heck of a job."
Though he has the fourth-best
batting average among players
that have started at least half of
Michigan's games (.294), Biondi
sits atop the same group in on-
base percentage (.434) because
of his patience at the plate.
Over the past seven games, he
has walked eight times, and his
season-total 15 walks place him

inside the top 10 of the Big Ten.
Maloney knows that when
Biondi gets on base, he will dis-
rupt almost any opposing pitch-
er's rhythm with his speed - he
is currently tied for first in the
conference with 15 steals.
"When he's getting on base,
he's going to raise havoc with
the pitcher," Maloney said. "It
makes it harder for the pitcher
because he has to pitch out of
the stretch and he has to pay
a lot of attention to Patrick,
and that forces him to throw
some pitches he doesn't want to
throw. Over time, that will help
you win."
On Sunday, Biondi went 4-for-
5 and walked once. Maloney
credited him with Michigan's
offensive outbreak.
"That's what we need him to
do if we are going to have suc-
cess."
UP FOR GRABS: Even with an
encouraging weekend, Maloney
is still looking for answers.
When asked about which area
of improvement the Wolverines
need to be focusing on after
Michigan's three-game series
against IPFW, there was no hesi-
tation.
"I think our relief pitching,"
Maloney said. "We have to have
someone step up."
After two months, Maloney
has yet to find a consistent bull-
pen rotation. During the week-
end, 10 different relievers made
an appearance.
The relief corps didn't start
the series well, as it relinquished
three extra-inning runs during
Michigan's 8-6 loss on Friday.
But it bounced back, allowing
just two earned runs during
the rest of the series. Maloney

lineup
pointed to the performances of
his underclassman as positives.
"I thought (right-hander)
Mike Doloff - even though he
gave up some runs - looked
okay, and I'm encouraged by
that," Maloney said. "He's just a
freshman, and I've got to get him
out there."
Maloney, though, was not
fooled by the bullpen's impres-
sive stretch. He knows that
there are still holes that need to
be filled.
"Somebody has to rise up.
We'll keep throwing guys out
there and hope that someone
just takes the ball and says, 'I'm
the guy.'
"We need somebody on the
back-end of the game to be able
to shut them down. That's the
bottom line - it's the number-
one thing we have to correct."
PITCHER AT THE PLATE:
For anyone who's been tracking
the Wolverines this year, there
must have been some confusion
when sophomore Alex Lakatos
stepped to the plate as the desig-
nated hitter during Michigan's
home opener against IPFW.
Lakatos, who has pitched 12.1
innings out of the bullpen this
year, hadn't had an at-bat all
season until Friday. Unfazed, he
laced the third pitch he saw to
left-center field for a double. He
started on Saturday as well, fin-
ishing the series 1-for-5.
The sophomore is no strang-
er to the batters box. In 2011,
Lakatos split time between the
mound and the outfield. In 128
at-bats, he batted .258 with 7
doubles, 12 runs and 10 RBIs.
The right-hander also pitched
three innings in relief on Friday,
allowing just one earned run.

that a single game can indicate

and wide range of hitting abili-

the conference with a less-than-
desirable .260-team batting aver-

If the Wolverines manage to
feed off the successful series
against the Mastodons, the games
could just depend on what the
coaching staff has been monitor-
ing all season - confidence.
Regardless of the recent hit-
ting fluctuations, pitching staff
uncertainties and team morale,
Michigan might be able to notch
two straight wins and break past
.500 if Oakland (3-16) and East-
ern Michigan (8-14) play like their
records show. Both schools seem
to have problems of their own.
Aside from Golden Grizzlies'
three top weekendpitchers, their
bullpen is crowded with inexperi-
ence and their batters scored just
four runs in the three-game series
against Michigan State.
The Eagles will be post a tough-
er matchup for the Wolverines
as they, too, come off a two-win
weekend against Miami (Ohio).
Eastern's team statistics look very
similar, almost identical, to Mich-
igan's battingtallies.
So the pitching department
will be the determining factor
between a midweek win and loss.
But the Wolverines are likely to
catch a break with Oakland and
Eastern's probable starters post-
ing a 7.59 ERA and an 11.40 ERA,
respectively.
But Michigan just needs to
worry about itself.
"Somebody has to rise up,"
Maloney said. "I'm hoping some-
body just takes the bullet to say,
'I'm the guy.' We're waiting on
that."

Evans leading softball charge

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
In Michigan's last tournament
before the team started home
games, the Wolverines managed
to score justtwo
tune in three NOTEBOOK
games.
A main reason for this was the
team's "lack of quality at-bats."
Since returning home, the Wol-
verines have bucked that trend
and witnessed an offensive reviv-
al.
Through the first four games of
a five-game home stand, Michigan
has won three of four games by
mercy rule, including both ends of
Saturday's doubleheader against
Penn State as well as its season
opener against Eastern Michigan.
The sudden offensive explosion
for the Wolverines can be credited
to the senior center fielder and
leadoff hitter Bree Evans.
Evans, who hit .500 in the
weekend's series, went three-for-
three in Saturday's first game and
scored three of Michigan's 11 runs,
including the 10th run via senior
first baseman Amanda Chidester's
game-ending two-run home run.
Being the leadoff hitter, it is
Evans' responsibility to try to
expose the opposing pitcher's vul-
nerabilities to the rest of the team.
"I want to try to get as many
pitches as I can so the batters can
see as many pitches before they're
at bat," Evans said.
Since the role of the leadoff hit-
ter is to "set the table" for the mid-
dle of the lineup, it's important for
Evans to get on base by any means
possible.

"The whole time, I'm trying
to get (the ball) on the ground,"
Evans said.
Due to Evans' speed, hitting
the ball on the ground and finding
open holes in the infield is essen-
tial for her success. As a result,
28 of her 30 hits this season have
been singles.
THREE'S COMPANY: After
picking up all three wins for the
Michigan softball team against
Penn State over the weekend,
freshman pitcher Haylie Wagner
was awarded with Big Ten Pitcher
of the Week. This marks the third
time that Wagner has won the
award this season.
With the three weekend victo-
ries, Wagner improved to 15-4.
Wagner went the distance in
both of her starts, highlighted by
her fourth shutout on Sunday. In
that game, Wagner struck out five
while only giving up two hits.
"Haylie is our best pitcher," said
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins.
"I thought she was our best
option."
Wagner's other win was in the
second game of Saturday's dou-
bleheader, when she came in as a
reliever for fellow freshman Sara
Driesenga. Wagner went on to
pitch the last three innings of the
game, tallying two strikeouts.
Having the ability "to stay in
(her) moment" was something
that Hutchins believed was criti-
cal for the Wolverines this week-
end, and Wagner had that.
Unlike the Nittany Lions'
pitching, which allowed 20 walks
over the weekend series, Wagner
walkedorily three. In addition, she
managed to surrender just six hits

to Penn State, while registering
ten strikeouts.
After holding Penn State to a
.118 average, Wagner was able to
finish the week with a1.40 ERA.
HOW SWEET IT IS: Freshman
catcher Lauren Sweet was anoth-
er award winner for Michigan this
week. For the first time, she was
named the Big Ten Freshman of
the Week.
While catching in all three
weekends games, Sweet hit .833,
going five-for-six at the plate and
adding a home run. Four of those
hits came on Saturday, as Sweet
went two-for-two in each game.
Because of her patience at the
plate, Sweet was able to draw four
walks at the plate in the three-
game set.
In addition, Sweet drove in
three runs and scored three runs
for the Wolverines.
As a result of this performance,
Sweet posted a 2.400 OPS during
the series against Penn State.
Perhaps hidden in Sweet's per-
formance from the weekend was
that it came from the eighth spot
in the batting order.
"The bottom of the order is as
important as the top of the order,"
Hutchins said.
Accordingto Hutchins, if Sweet
can continue this level of produc-
tion, Michigan can be a "danger-
ous team."
Plus, Sweet has something that
doesn't show up in the box score -
toughness.
After getting hit by a pitch in
the bottom of the sixth, Sweet
remained in the game and caught
the final inning even though she
appeared tobe in pain.

Sophomore defenseman Jon Merrill is still deciding whether he will return to the Michigan hockey team.
Seniors takedifferent
paths after season s end

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
After the Michigan hockey
team's premature exit from the
NCAA Tournament in the first
round on Friday, the upcoming
hockey banquet is the last chap-
ter remaining to be written in the
2011-12 season.
It serves as the seniors' last
hurrah, and to celebrate the work
the four members of the class of
2012 have put in over the years as
Wolverines.
Too bad not all the seniors will
be there. Forward David Wohl-
berg left Michigan on Monday for
Albany, N.Y. to sign an amateur-
tryout contract with the New
Jersey Devils' AHL team.
What should be time for the
Wolverines to unwind after the
end of their six-month season
is instead full of questions, as
uncertainty remains about which
players will stay in Ann Arbor to
continue their collegiate careers
and which will leave.
It's a different situation for
Wohlberg, who has finished his
Michigan eligibility and is no
longer a member of the team. But
it did provoke thought about the
only situation in which Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson would
approve of players leaving - a
chance to go to the NHL.
"Do you think there's a player
that graduates from Michigan
who would give up their senior
year to play in the American
League?" Berenson said. "There's
no way.

It's either the worst-kept
secret or the biggest non-
story of the Michigan
football team's spring practics:
Devin Gardner is taking snaps
at wide
receiver.
It's part
rumor, part
intrigue,
part imagi-
nation. Or
much ado
about noth- T
ing. T
Here's ROHAN
what we
know:
Last week, offensive coordi-
nator Al Borges - or any other
Michigan player or coach, for
that matter - would neither
confirm nor deny Gardner's new
role.
"Yeah," Borges said with a
smirk, "practices are closed for
a reason."
Denard Robinson - who
was a decoy and a sprint run-
ning back next to Gardner, the
quarterback, in Borges' "Deuce"
package last season - was
asked if the 6-foot-4 Gardner
were athletic enough to catch
a football. A switch flipped.
Robinson appeared robotic and
prepared, saying:
"Both of us just have the
same mindset. Whatever it
takes for the team to win, and
that's what we're going to do."
What about Gardner's hands?
"Both of us have good
hands," Robinson said.
Hmmm. Fishy.
Then, the most damning
evidence came over the week-
end when my brother, who's a
sophomore at Penn State, vis-
ited. As we drove by Michigan
Stadium, he asked about how
the team was shaping up. My
first thought was of Gardner.
I had gone to every press
conference. I had heard every
answer on Gardner. And I still
couldn't tell my brother for
certain he'd been practicing at
wide receiver. .
Before I could say anything,
my roommate Mike piped up
from the backseat. He didn't have
an unidentified source or break-
ing news to report from Twitter,
but he did have dinner the night
before with a football player who
told him Gardner looked good
takinga few reps at wide receiver
in practice. It's not fact. It's what
spring football is supposed to be
about: part rumor, part intrigue,
part imagination.

But the spring comes with a
warning, as does the rest of this
column - the heroes of spring
could be the dogs of fall. At its
best, spring football is a sneak
peak; at its worst, much ado
about nothing.
Let us indulge.
Imagine Gardner and Robin-
son and the flea-flicker possibil-
ities. Imagine Gardner running,
galloping past cornerbacks and
safeties. Imagine Robinson
throwing fades to the back
of the endzone to a tall, lean,
leaping No. 7. It doesn't seem
so crazy when you remember
Michigan lost its jump-ball
specialist to graduation. You
don't have to be an offensive
guru (read: Borges) to draw up
plays includingboth a Heisman
Trophy candidate and a previ-
ously top-ranked dual-threat
quarterback. What if the Deuce
was just a taste of what Borges
had in mind?
What if Gardner is getting a
head start on his preparation
for the NFL? If he's granted
a medical redshirt, Gardner
could have - at most - two
years to start at quarterback
after Robinson graduates.
But what if much-hyped 2013
freshman quarterback Shane
Morris proves himself ready
as the pocket passer Borges
needs? What if Gardner never
entrenches himself as Michi-
gan's starter and Robinson
hands the baton to Morris?
Now, calm down. I know I'm
getting ahead of myself. For
now. If you ask Borges, nothing
is out of the ordinary.
"We're doing-what we did a
year ago, pretty much," Borges
says. "We're going to play the
best 11 guys. Devin's the backup
quarterback right now. He's
number two, and we're goingto
do what we have to do to,get the
best 1ion the field. Nothing's
changed in that perspective, so
we pretty much have the same
mentality that we had."
So all of this speculation is
crazy, right?
Then Borges says things such
as, "(Gardner's) certainly one of
our better athletes on the team,
and we have to find a way to
exploit that.".
And then, he's asked if Gard-
ner's growth as a quarterback
will be stunted as he masquer-
ades at other positions, and
Borges says, "Nope. Not at all.
Smart kid, he'll be fine."
And then, he's asked if Gard-
ner is open to all of this, and

Borges says flatly, "Yeah. He
wants to play."
And then, you think to your-
self, OK, Tim's not so crazy
after all.
Since Borges came to Michi-
gan, he has said things such as,
"Every time you put together
a plan, you have to find out
how to factor him into it some-
where," in regard to Robinson
and Gardner. Last week, Borges
sounded convincing on the sub-
ject of Gardner, but in the next
breath he tried to spoon-feed
doses of reality.
"As you guys saw last year,
we're always looking for oppor-
tunities to get (Gardner) in
the game in some way, shape
or form without breaking the
rhythm of the quarterback,
which I don't think we did,"
Borges said. "And seeing to it
that we use him getting the ball,
use him throwing the ball and
use him decoying. With that
in mind, doingthe same thing
with Denard."
Reason says Gardner's job
description will be more sophis-
ticated than getting the ball,
throwing the ball, and decoy-
ing. If the job does include
receiver work, is that a knock
on Roy Roundtree, Jeremy Gal-
lon and the receivers? Or a nod
to Gardner's talent and Borges'
creativity?
Before Morris steps foot on
campus, Borges may be wise
to keep his top-two passers
healthy, especially consider-
ing Robinson's penchant for
boo boos. But why shouldn't he
dream a little this spring? Even
if he won't admit to Gardner
taking snaps at wide receiver,
a reasonable man like Borges
would admit that the spring's
the time to imagine, tinker, and
wonder: Will Gardner's role be
increased next season?
"I don't know," Borges said.
"I want to see. Maybe. I don't
know yet. We'll see. It's amatter
of how. That's the key. What are
you going to do? We've done a
lot with him, but there's still a
lot more that he can do, so we'll
see."

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Michigan yet to contact CMU transfer Trey Zeigler

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
It's always heartwarming to
hear of a star basketball recruit
opting to play for an unheralded
program to help it move toward
relevance.
Sometimes, though, that deci-
sion doesn't play out as planned.
On March 14, Central Michi-
gan men's basketball coach Ernie
Zeigler was fired after six sea-
sons with the Chippewas, and
his son, sophomore shooting
guard Trey Zeigler, was granted
a release soon after so he could

transfer. Zeigler was a consensus
top-100 recruit in high school,
and he declined offers from
Duke, Michigan State, Michigan
and UCLA to play for his father.
But now the recruiting battle
is back on after Zeigler averaged
over 31 minutes and 15 points per
game in each of his first two sea-
sons with Central Michigan. He
visited Duke last weekend and
ranks the Blue Devils at the top
of his list.
"I really liked Duke this past
weekend," Zeigler told The
Michigan Daily on Monday. "I
got to know Coach K a little bit,

better and his staff, some of the
players. It's definitely a possible
spot for me."
Zeigler has also spoken with
Pittsburgh, UCLA, LSU and
Michigan State, and he plans
to make some more visits in
the coming weeks. Contrary
to reports from some online
recruiting services, Michigan
has not yet reached out to Zei-
gler.
Michigan's lack of interest is
peculiar because the Wolver-
ine backcourt will lack depth
next season, especially with the
recent news of freshman combo

guard Carlton Brundidge trans-
ferring. And Zeigler indicated
on Monday that he may be inter-
ested if Michigan were to contact
him.
"Yeah, Michigan recruited me
all the way until the very end,"
Zeigler said. "I didn't make a
decision until my senior year.
Me and Coach Beilein had a very
good relationship, and the assis-
tants, too. So I felt really com-
fortable the first go-around.
"It would be hard to tell until
I talked with Coach Beilein if
they do reach out, just because
I don't really know where they
