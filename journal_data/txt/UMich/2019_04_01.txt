The University of Michigan 
introduced 
a 
new 
study 
to 
investigate 
the 
relationship 
between biosensors and health 
results 
earlier 
this 
month, 
following a pilot program in 
September. 
 
The 
Michigan 
Predictive Activity and Clinical 
Trajectories 
(MIPACT) 
study 
is analyzing information from 
Apple Watches to see if it can 
offer accurate data on health and 
wellness.
Dr. 
Sachin 
Kheterpal, 
an 
associate 
professor 
of 
anesthesiology at the University’s 
Medical School, is leading the 
MIPACT team and is interested 
in using biosensors like Apple 

Watches 
because 
they 
have 
become a prevalent part of society.
In 
an 
email 
interview, 
Kheterpal said not much research 
exists on the data devices like 
Apple Watches collect.
“In recent years, wearable 
technology has rapidly spread 
into 
consumer 
markets 
and 
provides unique opportunities to 
engage individuals on tracking 
and 
managing 
their 
health,” 
Kheterpal said. “Utilization of 
mobile applications in health care 
research and administration can 
streamline patient consent, data 
collection and distribution of 
health care interventions.”

Michigan Sahānā hosted an 
energetic night of music and dance 
on Saturday with its annual “That 
Brown 
Show.” 
Approximately 
300 hundred students, faculty 
and residents gathered at Hill 
Auditorium to watch Sahānā’s 
and five other dance groups’ 
student dancers and musicians 
blend classical and modern Indian 
dance and music. 
Michigan Sahānā is a student 
group focused on the appreciation 
and 
performance 
of 
Indian 
classical music and dance. This 
year’s 
production 
of 
“That 
Brown Show” was the first “That 
Brown Show Championship” in 
which Sahānā opened the stage 
to performances from five other 
Indian dance groups including 

Michigan Izzat, Michigan Taal, 
Michigan 
Manzil, 
Michigan 
Bhangra 
Team, 
Wolveraas, 
Sahana Music, in addition to 
performances by Sahānā’s own 
dancers and musicians. 
Sahānā Vice President Pranav 
Vijay, LSA junior, described how 
this event came to fruition. 
“We do TBS every year, but 
this year we really wanted to do 
something special, something we 
had never done before,” Vijay said. 
“Around October/November, we 
had the idea for Championship, 
and, by luck, I guess, got probably 
the best team we could have 
asked for. Every single person 
was so qualified and all of us came 
together and put this show on and 
it was just a blast.”
According to Sahānā dancer 
Keshav 
Akella, 
Engineering 
freshman, 
this 
year’s 
“That 

Brown Show” served as a way for 
the various Indian dance groups 
on campus to express their love 
and passion for the art of Indian 
dance in its various styles.
“Sure, all of our dance clubs are 
different in what we do, because 
there’s classical, there’s Raas, 
there’s the hip-hop, Bollywood 
type dances,” Akella said. “But 
we’re kind of cut from the same 
cloth of Indian dance and the 
unity behind it.”
The 
night 
began 
with 
a 
performance 
by 
Sahānā’s 
musicians, 
using 
traditional 
Indian 
instruments 
and 
techniques. This performance 
was quickly followed by the 
dancers 
of 
the 
all-female 
Michigan Taal group, who fused 
classical and modern Indian 
dance, incorporating numerous 
other styles of modern dance as 

well.
Vijay explained the necessity of 
this fusion of classical and modern 
artforms.
“I think it’s really important 
to preserve our roots and culture 
and I think (That Brown Show) is 
something that combines modern 
elements of dance plus we’re still 
sticking to our roots,” Vijay said. 
“I think it combines that in an 
amazing way.”
Engineering sophomore James 
Pelkey said he came to the event 
after seeing the passion his friend, 
a dancer in the all-male Michigan 
Izzat troupe, had for dance. Pelkey 
echoed the ethos of the event 
when describing the importance 
of events like it.

At 
Bethlehem 
United 
Church of Christ on Sunday 
afternoon, 
Sister 
Simone 
Campbell gave an interactive 
lecture 
addressing 
poverty, 
structural racism and income 
disparity in the United States. 
About 200 people attended the 
lecture and fundraiser, which 
was sponsored by the Ann 
Arbor chapter of RESULTS, an 
advocacy group that seeks to 
end poverty. 
Sister 
Simone 
is 
the 
Executive 
Director 
of 
NETWORK, 
a 
Catholic 
advocacy group that lobbies 
to mend gaps in income and 
wealth. She wrote the “Nun’s 
Letter,” 
a 
letter 
endorsing 
Obamacare which some credit 
as an important contribution in 
convincing Congress to support 
the Affordable Care Act. Sister 
Simone also led five cross-
country “Nuns on the Bus” trips 
to lobby members of Congress 
on issues like economic justice, 
immigration reform and voter 
turnout.

Apple Watch data on wellness results


“The mission of the Michigan 
China Forum is to connect 
Michigan with China by inviting 
key 
figures 
across 
different 
industries to discuss the latest 
and most controversial topics,” 
Shang said. “We’re committed to 
empowering future leaders of the 
United States, China and beyond 
to excel in the global landscape. 
The forum will serve as a 
platform for students and young 
professionals 
across 
different 
cultures to gain insights, dispel 
biases and engage in inspiring 
dialogues.”
Ray Cao, Michigan China 
Forum 
co-president 
and 
Engineering senior, elaborated 
on this year’s conference theme. 
“This year our forum has 
the theme of ‘Empower the 
Transformation,’ which reflects 
the 
ongoing, 
unprecedented 
changes that’s happened with the 
Sino-US relationship,” Cao said. 

“Michigan China Forum will 
help connect industry leaders 
with future victors to face all the 
chief challenges and welcome all 
the transformations.” 
Brian 
Wu, 
Ross 
China 
Initiatives faculty director and 
associate professor of strategy, 
gave a brief overview of the 
history between the University 
and China. Wu explained the 
third 
University 
President 
James Angell was also a U.S. 
minister to China. According to 
Wu, Angell convinced the U.S. 
government to return a 1901 
war indemnity to China, which 
helped fund Tsinghua University, 
China’s top academic institution, 
and provided scholarships for 
Chinese students to study abroad. 
However, Angell’s involvement 
in 
drafting 
exclusionary 
immigration policy in the late 
1800s has warranted criticism. 
Angell negotiated the Angell 
Treaty in 1880, an agreement 
with China permitting the United 
States to restrict but not entirely 
ban Chinese immigration. The 

Angell Treaty formed the basis of 
the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, 
which ended immigration of both 
skilled and unskilled Chinese 
laborers for 10 years and required 
every Chinese person traveling 
to and from the United States to 
carry identification. 
In addition, according to Wu, 
when the Chinese table tennis 
team visited the United States 
in 1972 in what has been dubbed 
“ping-pong diplomacy” — the 
thawing of Cold War tensions 
between the U.S. and China after 
each country’s national ping pong 
team was invited and travelled 
to the other country — the 
University was its first stop. In 
2017, University faculty organized 
the 45th anniversary celebration 
of ping-pong diplomacy. 
In 
his 
welcome 
speech, 
Brad Killaly, Associate Dean 
of Ross Global Programs and 
clinical assistant professor of 
strategy, expressed the mission 
of the Michigan China Forum 
aligns 
with 
the 
mission 
of 
both the Business School and 
the 
larger 
University 
in 
promoting understanding and 
cooperation.
“Regardless of how we may 
feel in the discourse around in 
the world now with potentially 
a lack of understanding across 
boundaries 
and 
borders, 
events 
such 
as 
this 
are 
absolutely critical in changing 
representation of a boxing 
match to one of handshakes,” 
Killaly said. “And our role and 
our responsibility here at the 
Ross School of Business and 
of our entire University is to 
in fact build an entire world 
of handshakes, optimism and 
positive change.”
Zhao Jian, consul general 
of China in Chicago, delivered 
the keynote speech, in which 
he highlighted the economic 
growth of China in the last 
70 years. He noted China is 
the world’s second largest 
economy 
and 
has 
lifted 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
Chinese people out of poverty. 
Jian said China’s development 
is a result of the hard work and 
wisdom of the Chinese people. 
According 
to 
Zhao 

Jian, 
China 
is 
devoted 
to 
open 
cooperation 
as 
global 
relationships benefit China and 
the rest of the world depends on 
China. 
“China 
is 
committed 
to 
deepening reform and opening 
wider 
to 
the 
world,” 
Zhao 
Jian 
said. 
“Openness 
brings 
progress while seclusion leads 
to backwardness. China cannot 
develop itself in isolation from 
the world, and the world needs 
China for global prosperity.”
Zhao Jian expressed the Sino-
U.S. relationship has been key in 
addressing a number of issues, 
including 
counterterrorism, 
trade, environmental protection, 
disease 
control 
and 
moon 
exploration. 
Going 
forward, 
though much has changed, Zhao 
Jian emphasized the importance 
of cooperation between China 
and the United States.
“The 
importance 
of 
this 
bilateral 
relationship 
to 
welfare of the people of our 
two countries and the broader 
international community has not 
changed,” Zhao Jian said. “This 
is a relationship between the 
largest developing country and 
the largest developed country, 
actually the only superpower in 
the world … We both stand to gain 
from cooperation and lose from 
confrontation.” 
Sino-U.S. Relations Panel
The 
Sino-U.S. 
Relations 
Panel was held immediately 
following the Opening Ceremony. 
Moderated by LSA junior Ian 
Wang, the panel centered around 
three major themes: nationalism 
and 
political 
development, 
politics of the Sino-U.S. trade 
relation 
and 
conflicts 
and 
cooperation. 
Panel members included Wu; 
Suisheng Zhao, University of 
Denver professor of Chinese 
politics and foreign policy; Ronald 
Inglehart, 
professor 
emeritus 
of political science; Jerry Lou, 
founder and CEO of Everpine 
Capital; and Shunri Guo, CEO 
and co-founder of ParcelX.

From Page 1


On my laptop, you’ll find 
a bookmarked folder labeled 
“Beauty,” which is completely 
filled with articles on KBeauty — 
Korean Beauty, for short. You’ll 
see that my skincare and makeup 
routine is made up of only Korean 
products and that my email inbox 
is cluttered with newsletters from 
Soko Glam, a U.S. website that 
curates KBeauty products, and 
the Klog, a KBeauty blog. Suffice 
to say, you’ll probably come to the 
conclusion that I am a Kbeauty 
obsessive, and you’d be correct.
I’ve used KBeauty for about 
three years now, but it wasn’t until 
last year that I became aware of 
the deeply entrenched colorism 
that is present in KBeauty — and 
in other Asian beauty products 
as well. This manifests itself 
most clearly in skin-whitening 
products, 
products 
that 
are 
marketed, mostly toward women, 
to encourage them to run after 
a colorist, dangerous beauty 
standard of having lighter skin.
It can hide itself in less obvious 
products 
as 
well, 
products 
that aren’t explicitly marketed 
toward whitening one’s skin. 
The key is an ingredient known 
as hydroquinone, which I found 
in a product that did not include 
any packaging about being skin-
whitening; when I had bought it, I 
was not aware of this ingredient or 
that it was used in skin-whitening 

products. Once I learned about it, 
I stopped using the product.
This ingredient, and more 
explicit skin-whitening products, 
don’t just perpetuate a certain 
white American and European 
beauty standard, but can also 
be incredibly harmful to those 
who use them. Physically, it 
can lead to intense cystic acne 
and irreversible skin thinning; 
mentally, it can make one feel less 
adequate, less human for being 
deemed “too dark.”
KBeauty 
has 
also 
lagged 
behind in what’s been called the 
“Fenty effect,” after Rihanna’s 
beauty line that has gained 
acclaim for its numerous (40! 
shades!) and inclusive shades for 
all women, not just white women. 
Meanwhile, 
many 
KBeauty 
products often only offer five or 
six shades, sometimes even as low 
as three.
One could argue that South 
Korea doesn’t have as many 
black and brown folks living 
in the country, and that is why 
they have limited shades. While 
that’s certainly true, it doesn’t 
account for the fact that KBeauty 
has exploded in the U.S. and 
elsewhere, where there are many 
black and brown folks, and many 
who are making their mark in 
the beauty industry and world. If 
KBeauty companies know their 
products are extremely popular to 
users outside of South Korea, then 
they must take into account the 
varying shades of all people.

All of this points to the history 
and continuation of colorism 
within South Korea, as well as in 
many other Asian countries and 
Asian American communities. 
Historically, 
Koreans 
with 
tanner or slightly darker skin 
were associated with the poor 
and farm work, which was often 
looked down upon because they 
were not part of the nobility. The 
valorization and fetishization of 
white skin dates as far back as 

the Gojoseon era, and European 
and 
American 
imperialism 
certainly didn’t help matters in 
the perpetuation of colorism, 
either. Today, South Korea leads 
in cosmetic surgery, and many, 
many people find ways to lighten 
their skin.
So why do I still buy from 
KBeauty companies? I avoid 
the skin-whitening products, of 
course. But when I began my foray 
into KBeauty a few years ago, it 

was because I wanted to clear up 
my skin (which I recognize is a 
beauty standard / norm that I am 
still wrestling with) and because 
a part of me believed that this 
would be a way for me to feel more 
authentically Korean American, 
never mind the fact that there 
isn’t just one way of being 
“authentically” Korean American. 
A part of me still believes that, 
and it is something that I am still 
wrestling with as well.

But there is also some evidence 
that KBeauty companies are 
following in the footsteps of those 
who have widened the beauty 
industry to be more inclusive for 
people of color. There are a few 
KBeauty brands that, while they 
certainly don’t have as many as 
Rihanna’s 40 shades, have more 
than what is normally seen in 
many KBeauty products. It’s 
certainly a start — and yet, there is 
so much more room to grow.

Application Deadline: April 15th 
msfe.illinois.edu

Do you have a background in Math, Engineering, or Computer Science? 
You Could Have a Future in Financial Engineering at Illinois!

From those who chased it, to those who nurtured it, to those who fulfilled it, I wanted to understand how these three words shaped each generation in my 
family, and what it meant to each one of us through our greatest successes and regrets.

Accomplishment: “My greatest 
achievement 
in 
my 
eighty-
something years of life…It was 
also the cause of my greatest 
challenges, but it would be 
coming to America. My early 
years of life in Korea was poor...
Dirt poor. I didn’t have electricity, 
my clothes were cheap, and 
daily life was mediocre. A 
sustainable life was unheard of 
– a strange concept to me back 
then – but when I heard about 
the opportunities and almost 
fantasy-like tales of America, I 
just had to. It was my dream… 
for myself, more for my children. 
But achieving that dream was 
difficult in itself… when we made 
payments to come to America 
by plane, we never expected the 
hardships that followed us. I 
was in my thirties, not knowing 
the language or culture, with 
no knowledge in navigating 
the Los Angeles streets. I was a 
mere house painter, while your 
grandmother worked in a sewing 
factory - pause - But it was worth 
it. The dream, it was worth it.”

Regret: “My greatest regret 
is the most obvious one – which 
I failed to realize back then – 
was not learning how to speak 
English. I came with the mindset 
that we were too old to adopt 
a new language… And plus, 
working non-stop at various 
blue-collar jobs didn’t give me 
time to sit down and open a book 
to learn English. I was too busy. 
At the same time, I assumed 
that my kids, who went to public 
American schools back then, 
would help me if I ran into any 
issues with my broken English. 
I didn’t realize that even though 
we lived in Koreatown – the 
neighbors spoke Korean, the 
restaurants were all Korean, 
even the dogs that roamed the 
streets were of that Korean jindo 
kind – everything was still in 
English. Looking back, it caused 
a lot of misunderstandings and 
problems in my life, even to the 
point where I had lost money.”
 

Eating out used to be a 
delicacy. I once longed for the 
rare weekends when my family 
would go out to a restaurant like 
Olive Garden or even a fast food 
chain like Taco Bell. I shake my 
head when I remember how I 
once gagged at the food my mom 
spent hours preparing for us. 
Home-cooked Gujarati meals 
— the same meals I rejected 
years ago by sticking out my 
tongue — is now a blessing I’m 
rarely afforded, but it’s one that 
I humbly accept when I get the 
chance. The presence of spice 
and a distinct savory scent 
dominates my taste buds and 
nostrils where the bland pizza 
and salads of the dining halls 
don’t even stir me.
Yet Gujarati food is more than 
just something that feels good 

to eat. It’s through these foods, 
these spices and these smells 
that I remain connected to who 
I am and where I come from. For 
as much as my language skills 
may deteriorate, my religious 
beliefs may lose conviction, 
and my family members may 
become distant, what binds all of 
this together is an appreciation 
for the cuisine. I speak Gujarati 
with precision while asking my 
grandma about the dhokla she 
cooked. My parents tell me the 
importance of giving prasad as 
an offering to the Hindu deities. 
My cousins and I can always 
bond at the dinner table as we 
eat rice and daal.
As my conception of being 
Gujarati continues to fall apart, 
food is the constant that keeps 
me grounded in my culture and 
my upbringing. When I warm 
up food from my mom in the 
microwave, the smell reminds 

me of the time and care she 
puts into feeding her two sons. 
When I open up the fridge to 
grab a container, I see my dad 
carefully filling those containers 
and handing them to me. When 
I take a bite, I flashback to my 
grandma feeding it to me as a 
toddler who couldn’t even hold 
a spoon.
Indian food is more than 
just sustenance: It is a cultural 
element 
that 
sustains 
my 
connection with my family and 
my identity. No matter how 
well I abide to the standards 
of being Gujarati or an Indian-
American, I remain confident 
that our food will be like a 
trail of breadcrumbs. Should I 
choose to follow it, I will find 
contentment with my future 
cultural 
engagement 
while 
being able to look back and 
remember where I came from. 

Whenever a relative from 
India 
can’t 
understand 
my 
broken Gujarati and says to just 
speak English, the thought comes 
up. Whenever I go to mandir 
to pray and don’t know what to 
say or think, the thought comes 
up. Whenever an international 
student from the Motherland 
makes an offhand comment 
about how I’m not really Indian, 
the thought comes up.
I think that I’m not Indian. I 
think that I’m a first generation 
college student who can never 
know his culture as well as his 
parents. I can’t ever be a real 
Hindu. I can’t maintain the 
traditions my family tried to 
preserve and instill in me. I’m 
not Indian.
Reconciling an Indian cultural 
background with an American 

upbringing is a moment-to-
moment 
struggle. 
When 
I 
introduce myself to someone, I 
stutter. Should I say my name 
the way I’ve said it my whole 
life? Or should I say it the way 
my family and any Indian person 
says it? Either way feels wrong. 
I don’t even try to speak Hindi, 
and when I try to make small 
talk in Gujarati with family, 
they just end up switching to 
English anyway to accomodate 
my bumbling demeanor. Even 
though my identity on most 
documents is Indian American, 
the second identifier feels more 
prevalent than the first.
Despite the vast cultural divide 
I feel among relatives, there 
is a response to this notion of 
Indian-ness. Not only is there no 
explicit rulebook dictating what 
it means to be Indian, but it’s not 
necessary either to try and group 
yourself into these one size fits all 
monoliths. Being Indian should 

not come at the expense of my 
own sense of self. I can care about 
Indian culture without beating 
myself up over not abiding by 
arbitrary nonexistent guidelines. 
What’s more useful to focus on 
is my own personal identity. 
I don’t have to say I’m Indian 
or American or any particular 
binary label for identity. What I 
can use to identify myself is my 
appreciation for Indian culture, 
whether that is the food, the 
celebrations, or my family. I 
can 
consider 
my 
American 
upbringing 
without 
feeling 
guilty too. Being in this country 
has cultivated within me a sense 
of individualism, an appreciation 
for different cultures, and a 
pursuit of knowledge that make 
me thankful and proud to have 
grown up here. I am an Indian-
American, and I don’t have to 
keep on questioning what it 
means to be one. I’m already 
doing what is right.

Accomplishment: 
“My 
greatest 
achievement 
- chuckle - would be my 
children – you guys. I can’t 
even comprehend my ability 
to love someone, the fact that 
I’m able to have that much 
love for someone. Whatever 
[my 
two 
daughters] 
do, 
I 
always 
feel 
proud… 
You’ll 
become 
a 
parent 
and understand… To see 
them grow with abundant 
opportunities, to see them 
adopt two different cultures, 
it’s a blessing. That would 
be my biggest achievement 
– to build our life here so 
that it would be enough for 
my two daughters… If I lose 
everything, it doesn’t matter. 
I have my family by my side. 
That’s why I’m happy. As 
long as I have my children.”
Regret: “Hmm.. regrets? 
This one is tough… I would 
say I regret my habit of 
avoidance. What I mean 
to say is that I used to 
constantly flee from my 

problems. 
Relational 
problems, 
problems 
at 
school, or at work… I tried 
to escape, rather than face 
them. When I was young, 
especially 
after 
coming 
right to America, there was 
the issue of language and 
adjusting… I was already 
17 when I arrived here… 
I remember when I got 
rejected from college, they 
offered me a chance to 
appeal. I thought it was too 
much work so I decided to go 
to a college that just accepted 
me instead… Because I kept 
hiding from my fears, every 
time these same problems 
would occur over and over 
again, 
they 
were 
every 
bit discouraging and self-
hindering. I wish I had been 
more bold back then, wish I 
had the courage to be more 
proactive… but it’s still never 
too late to change my habit, 
even now.”

Accomplishment: 
“I 
can’t 
say I’ve accomplished quite 
a lot in my 19 years of life, but 
my greatest accomplishment 
so far… as predictable as this 
may be, would be college. 
Being accepted and going to 
a university may seem like a 
almost-shallow, societal metric 
of how “well” you’re playing the 
game of life. But reflecting back 
on the previous interviews with 
my parents and grandparents, I 
know this “achievement” hasn’t 
been on my own, but decades in 
the making. What makes this 
so important to me is that my 
grandmother never received 
any form of college education. 
My grandfather attended a local 
college, only to spend his life as 
a house painter. My father and 
mother were able to attend state 
colleges, despite their language 
barrier and underprivileged 
households. 
My 
education 
means the world to me because 
not only am I learning for 
myself, but on behalf of my 
family who has gotten me to 

this point in life…I had selfishly 
assumed this opportunity – or 
gift – of education should have 
been given to me, but now I am 
eternally grateful for it.”
Regret: “My regret – and also 
my motivator – is not realizing 
this sooner. I remember going 
through a stage of “I can’t 
wait to leave my family and 
become independent,” hence 
my 
decision 
of 
choosing 
Michigan. But now I’ve wished 
I spent more time with them, 
with 
greater 
appreciation 
and understanding of their 
hardships. It’s so easy to assume 
their lives were as cushioned as 
mine – since the world I was 
born into, and only ever known 
is what they have provided me 
with. As I look to the future, 
I’m encouraged and excited to 
take use of all the chances I’ve 
been given, because that’s what 
my parents – and grandparents 
– have struggled long and hard 
for.”

Build coalitions for social justice through student orgs
I

n the fall of 2016 at the 
University of Michigan, 
a chapter of HeForShe, 
a gender equality solidarity 
movement, was formed. Over 
this past summer, a HeForShe 
member was venting their 
frustrations 
about 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
response to Richard Spencer’s 
visit to a University employee. 
The 
employee 
told 
them 
something 
that 
HeForShe 
believes 
should 
frame 
our 
approach to activism work 
on campus: “Students can be 
frantic and the University can 
be hesitant.”
As 
we 
have 
seen, 
the 
University’s 
student 
body 
has been increasingly at odds 
with University officials and 
the administration. Protests 
have 
shut 
down 
the 
bus 
systems and filled the Fleming 
Administration 
Building, 
teach-outs are highly attended 
and student activists across 
campus are at a loss for how 
to get the University to listen 
to them and understand their 
needs.
HeForShe 
also 
attributes 
the 
University’s 
reluctant 
responses 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
cohesion among social justice 
activism groups on campus. 
There are more than 1,500 
student 
organizations 
on 
Maize Pages. Filtered down 
by the “activism” category, 
365 organizations still show 
up. The point being: There 
are a lot of student activists 
and activism groups at the 
University of Michigan.
This is a great thing and 
it 
proves 
that 
there 
are 
thousands of us on campus who 
are willing to fight for what 
we believe in. What HeForShe 

wonders is how can we work 
together to achieve our goals. 
Social 
justice 
orgs 
seem 
to compete for attendance 
at events, attention of the 
administration and campus 
resources 
like 
rooms 
and 
funding. How can we reach 
social justice on our campus 
when individual organizations 
seem to be yelling into a void, 
drowned out by the sheer 
volume of clubs?

When we fight for social 
justice, we are not doing so 
to beat down other social 
justice organizations. There 
should not be any competition 
when we are fighting for the 
same goals. As an activism 
organization, HeForShe hopes 
to build a coalition of student 
activists and student activism 
organizations 
because 
so 
much more can happen if we 
pool our ideas and resources 
together. We all strive for 
similar goals: equality and 
justice.
There are measures being 
taken. The Central Student 
Government liaison program 
is a new initiative designed “to 
provide a platform for students 
and their organizations to 
externally 
address 
possible 
issues within their groups. It 

also aims to foster a greater 
connection between campus 
organizations.” HeForShe was 
one of the first social justice 
organizations to be a part of 
the program and we highly 
encourage other organizations 
to get involved.
In 
order 
to 
build 
this 
coalition 
for 
social 
justice 
on our campus, HeForShe is 
taking the first step: reaching 
out. We are embarking on a 
listening tour and we want 
to meet all gender equality-
related student organizations 
to form a relationship. We 
want to know who is on their 
executive board, what their 
mission statement is, what 
events they are are hosting and 
how we can work together to 
achieve gender equality on our 
campus.
To do this, we ask that 
student 
organizations 
that 
deal 
with 
gender 
equality 
(even tangentially) attend the 
first ever student organization 
summit dedicated to coalition 
building. The event is called 
“The State of Gender Equality 
Orgs at U-M: Student Org 
Summit” and it will be held 
Tuesday, 
April 
2 
from 
7 
p.m. to 9 p.m. in the Harlan 
Hatcher 
Graduate 
Library 
Gallery (Room 100). For more 
information, find the event on 
Facebook.
As students cycle in and out 
of the University at the close 
of the winter 2019 semester, 
HeForShe invites you to think 
about the future. What can we 
be doing now for the students 
who will come after us?

I

n a new Emerson poll, 
former Vice President 
Joe 
Biden 
and 
Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., at 
25 and 24 percent 
respectively, 
lead 
the 
Democratic 
field 
among 
Iowa voters. And 
moreover, 
Mayor 
Pete 
Buttigieg 
of 
South 
Bend, 
Indiana 
(11 
percent) 
surged 
ahead 
to 
third 
place 
followed 
by 
Sen. 
Kamala 
Harris, D-Calif., (10 percent) 
and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass. (9 percent).
These 
results 
are 
unsurprising for two reasons. 
The first is Buttigieg has 
absolutely shined recently, 
especially 
in 
a 
recent 
CNN Town Hall at SXSW, 
where he demonstrated his 
intelligence, thoughtfulness 
on policy and humility. Yet 
Harris 
and 
Warren 
have 
done the same, particularly 
given 
they 
have 
both 
recently released large and 
substantive policy proposals. 
Harris introduced a national 
plan to dramatically raise 
teacher 
salaries, 
and 
Warren proposed plans to 
make childcare affordable, 
decrease 
government 
corruption, break up large 
tech 
corporations 
and 
decrease wealth inequality 
by 
taxing 
the 
extremely 
wealthy, which leads us to 
the second reason this is 
unsurprising.
Despite 
Harris 
and 
Warren’s 
proposals 
and 
demonstrated 
support 
in 
Iowa, 
positive 
media 
coverage 
has 
mostly 
centered on traditional (or, 
white male) candidates. For 
example, former U.S. Rep. 
Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, has 
been presented as a rock star 
by the media, in spite of the 
fact that he has made only 
one trip to Iowa and only 
vaguely discussed his policy 
proposals. He has received 
some skeptical coverage, but 
not much — it’s mostly seen 
about his unclear platform 
or his love of standing on 
bar tops when speaking to 
voters, 
which 
apparently 
happens a lot.
On 
a 
similar 
note, 
Buttigieg has also received 
some particularly fawning 
coverage. A reporter shared 
an 
anecdote 
in 
which 
Buttigieg 
began 
abruptly 

speaking 
Norwegian 
to 
another 
journalist 
after 
learning 
he 
was 
from 
a 
Norwegian 
outlet. 
After 
revealing 
he 
learned Norwegian 
because he wanted 
to read an author 
whose 
work 
has 
not been translated 
in 
English, 
the 
anecdote went viral 
and everyone was 
charmed.
All 
of 
this 
is 
totally 
understandable. 
I, too, was charmed. Yet, 
this story is pretty much the 
extent of attention the media 
has given him. They have not 
posed substantive questions 
about his policies — which 
in my view, seem to be half-
baked adoptions of Warren’s 
proposals 
— 
or 
seriously 
assessed his qualifications.

Still, it is important to note 
the difference of Buttigieg 
from O’Rourke and the other 
traditional white and male 
candidates, 
which 
is 
the 
historic nature of Buttigieg’s 
campaign 
as 
the 
first 
openly-gay man ever to run 
for president. His candidacy 
will 
be 
inspirational 
for 
many, 
especially 
for 
the 
queer community and, in 
particular, queer youth. It 
is for this reason that it is 
unfair to lazily throw him 
into the same category as the 
other white male candidates, 
but it is also important to 
acknowledge the advantages 
his gender and race give him.
The 
fact 
that 
these 
personal stories are enough 
to 
push 
him 
ahead 
in 
the polls demonstrates a 
broader 
problem 
in 
how 
the 
electorate 
weighs 
personality 
much 
more 
than experience, policy and 
capability. Still, this cannot 
be separated from the sexism 
at play in determining who 
we are charmed by and for 
whom we have disdain. And 
the media plays an important 

role in who is considered 
likable and who is not.
People have a propensity 
to humanize those who look 
like them over those who 
do not by seeing themselves 
— their hopes, insecurities, 
desires, 
downfalls 
— 
in 
them. 
When 
a 
primarily 
young, white and male press 
corps covers the primary and 
general election, it is easy to 
see why more empathy and 
adoration is given to the 
white male candidates, in 
addition to the fact that 44 of 
45 American presidents have 
been white males.
Nonetheless, I was born 
and raised in Indiana, so I 
have known about and liked 
Buttigieg a lot longer than 
he has been on the national 
scene. In my view, Buttigieg 
is 
quite 
smart, 
genuine 
and 
passionate. 
After 
a 
recent interview on “Pod 
Save America,” he has even 
climbed higher on my list of 
favorite 2020 candidates.
Still, it is important to 
critique the fawning media 
coverage of O’Rourke and 
Buttigieg 
that 
celebrates 
personality while ignoring 
important policy platforms 
presented 
by 
female 
candidates, because media 
coverage 
shapes 
elections 
and how people think about 
candidates.
To be clear, the problem 
is with the media coverage 
and how it has subsequently 
affected 
voters. 
Pointing 
out the sexism at play for 
women in politics, especially 
when running for president, 
is not meant to attack male 
candidates 
or 
dissuade 
voters 
from 
supporting 
them. Even as I grow more 
and more frustrated at the 
sexism in this primary, I do 
not blame the candidates 
themselves for sexist media 
coverage or biased voters.
Calling out sexism — or 
in some cases, racism and 
homophobia— is meant to 
create 
an 
equal 
playing 
field where voters are free 
to support their prefered 
candidate 
without 
social 
biases 
creating 
unfair 
advantages. Making sexism 
visible 
to 
unsuspecting 
voters and journalists only 
calls on them to consider 
how their own biases shape 
who they view as electable, 
likable and presidential.

Monday, April 1, 2019 — 5A

It seems a shame that I should encounter 
“Jane the Virgin” in all its quirky, ambitious, 
pastel-coated glory and be made horribly, 
unspeakably angry. But that’s how the show’s 
last seven or so episodes have left me feeling. 
Not through any fault of their own — “Jane the 
Virgin” is the same formally interesting gem it 
has always been: sweet but caustic, a great lofty 
experiment in how many things a character can 
be and feel and say 
at 
once. 
What 
makes me mad is 
not how much the 
show is giving us, 
but how little it is 
getting in return.
There 
are 
subreddits of men 
who have devoted 
their 
lives 
to 
close reading the, 
oh I don’t know, 
four-hour, 
seven-
minute 
mark 
of 
the fifth episode 
of “Westworld,” a show so prestige-desperate 
and enamored of its own muddy mythology that 
it forgot to be even nominally watchable. Alec 
Baldwin — yes, Alec Baldwin — won an Emmy 
last year for his Donald Trump portrayal on 
“Saturday Night Live” because, hey, it’s Alec 
Baldwin, and he’s in an oversized suit and a silly 
wig and isn’t it nice when political commentary 
is actually neither political nor commentary but 
instead some sort of feckless lookalike contest?
With contemporaries like these, how could 
one not be angered by “Jane the Virgin”’s 
perennial Emmy snubbing? The show’s only two 
nominations have been for its terrific narrator, 
Anthony Mendez (who lost both times to PBS 
documentaries). There are a few likely reasons 
for this failure. First, of course, the show is 
unmistakably feminine. Jane Villanueva (Gina 
Rodriguez, “Carmen Sandiego”), the ebullient 
dreamer at the heart of it all, wears sundresses 
and writes romance novels and gabs with her 
mom and abuela. The show itself is both a love 
letter to and a subversion of the telenovela, 
an ostensibly feminine form. It also boasts a 
majority-minority cast. On “Jane the Virgin,” 
Latinx persons are not merely included, they’re 
centered. And perhaps the ultimate nail in the 
awards coffin — it’s on The CW, which is more 
a running joke than it is a television network. 
If the agreed upon formula for acclaim is to 
tell a story of the angst of men and to do it on 
an angsty network for angsty men, “Jane the 
Virgin” is probably not winning anything any 
time soon.
Or at least, this is what I had resigned 

myself to thinking. But then the fifth and final 
season premiered, and you know what? This 
time, I think they can do it. Gina Rodriguez 
delivers a one-shot, seven-minute monologue so 
disarming, so stunning and so conspicuous that 
it’s inconceivable that something this good could 
just slip under the Academy’s radar. If it does go 
unnoticed? Move to Neptune, become a cord-
cutter, burn everything down, nothing matters.
The monologue in question is Jane’s loopy, 
anguished response to (big spoiler!) the 
reappearance of her presumed-dead husband, 
Michael (Brett Dier, “Bomb Girls”). Following 
his death in the 
third season, Jane 
has 
spent 
four 
years grieving and 
figuring out how 
to move on from 
tragedy with grace, 
professionally, 
personally 
and 
romantically. 
It 
seemed, 
toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fourth season, that 
everything 
was 
falling into place 
for 
Jane. 
She’d 
had an epic breakthrough in writing her novel. 
Her mother, Xiomara (Andrea Navedo, “Law & 
Order”), had weathered cancer. Rafael (Justin 
Baldoni, “Everwood”), the father of her son, was 
planning to propose. In hindsight, it was only 
natural that the show would throw a wrench 
into all of that. And, oh, what a wrench.
Michael has been very much alive this whole 
time, his “death” orchestrated by the nefarious 
crime lord Sin Rostro (Bridget Regan, “The 
Last Ship”). But wait, there’s more! “Jane the 
Virgin” has checked off the final telenovela 
trope box by afflicting him with amnesia; he 
has no recollection of his previous life, and most 
distressingly, no recollection of Jane. He now 
goes by Jason, calls Jane “Ma’am” in a slow, 
unaffected drawl (much to Jane’s consternation) 
and is without his once-signature sense of 
humor.
“Jane the Virgin,” as its title cheekily hints, 
has always been about labels and living within 
the confines of those labels. At different points 
in her life, we’ve seen Jane struggle with what 
it means to be a mother, a virgin, a writer, a wife 
and now a widow. The real agony of Michael’s 
return lies in the very fragile peace Jane has 
made with her life since his death. If Michael’s 
memory comes back (which seems like it will be 
the case), where will that leave Jane? Or Jane 
and Rafael? Or Jane and Michael? What the 
show’s exciting challenge will be now — one it 
will surely pull off with aplomb — is to take the 
wacky situation it has engineered and to imbue 
it with the lived-in authenticity that makes 
“Jane the Virgin” truly special.

‘Jane’ deserves an Emmy

TV REVIEW

“The Old Drift” by Namwali Serpell is based on the 
tried and true concept of a cast of seemingly unrelated 
characters that, at some point in time, encounter 
each other in varying 
degrees 
of 
intimacy. 
In spite of this lack of 
ingenuity, 
“The 
Old 
Drift” still manages to 
capture readers with its 
colorful depiction of life 
in Zambia, through the 
eyes of three different 
families spanning over a 
century of history. 
The story begins with a colonial explorer, Percy 
Clark, in Africa, stomping through the wild the way 
only a rich white man in the 1890s could do. Serpell 
uses Percy’s life as a way of establishing the cultural 
background for the story, as well as highlighting the 
racial tensions that are expected from any kind of 
conquest-minded history.
“The Old Drift” strikes a difficult balance — race is 
obviously an important part of anyone’s identity and 
often shapes characters and readers alike, but it should 
not be the defining characteristic of any one person. 
In the race for diversity, we too often see authors 
reinventing their characters as an afterthought in order 
to appeal to a “broader” audience. Yet, even though the 
consequences of race are prominent throughout “The 
Old Drift,” Serpell creates characters whose existence 
doesn’t hinge solely upon their racial struggles.
Though “The Old Drift” retains a heavily 
heteronormative group of characters, Serpell deftly 
explores a variety of family dynamics. The benefit of 

following the same three families over a vast number of 
decades is that we can see how a marriage changes and 
evolves over time: Agnes and Ronald lose their passion, 
Matha’s parents are separated by political beliefs and 
Sibilla loses sight of the Frederico she once knew. It’s 
a cynical depiction of love — each couple is plagued by 
doubts and hardships, making it some small wonder 
any of them manage 
to stay together as 
their love dwindles. As 
someone who is heavily 
invested in YA novels 
and happy endings, I 
found 
each 
couple’s 
successive downfall a 
little depressing.
That 
twinge 
of 
sadness on the edge of each story, whether a lost dream 
or broken couple, helps Serpell suspend “The Old 
Drift” in a balanced world between sci-fi and historical 
fiction. Many of the plot obstacles that arise are rooted 
in Zambia’s political turmoil of the ’70s, showcasing 
the lasting effects of dreams unfollowed. As the book 
progresses, and more characters meet each other, 
these repercussions are explored further with Serpell 
dropping hints and consequences into each storyline.
“The Old Drift” doesn’t just stay in the past, though. 
Serpell creates and explores a future that carries with 
it many familiar worries, including climate change 
(dubbed “The Change”) and excessive government 
monitoring through technology. Her tactic is 
interesting: Serpell has created a world in the early 
2020s, a not-so-distant future that still manages to 
be as foreign as if she were to set it 200 years into the 
future. It’s a world poised just on the cusp of familiarity, 
highlighting the disasters and leaders at the root of an 
apocalyptic future, leaving the reader with a trace of 
the nervous energy of what could be. 

An ‘Old Drift’ for the ages

I have been through biology labs, 
physics labs, chemistry labs and several 
neuroscience labs. Who could have 
guessed that the lab to bewilder me 
the most was none other than the 
University of Michigan’s own JazzLab 
Ensemble?
This past Thursday, the JazzLab 
Ensemble 
gathered 
in 
Rackham 
Auditorium for a night of renditions of 
classic jazz pieces directed by Dennis 
Wilson. A total of 27 musicians filtered 
on and off the stage between numbers 
as the group swept between different 
genres of jazz — from the slow lyrical 
jazz of “Don’t Worry ‘Bout Me” to the 
fast-paced moving jazz of “Flight to 

Nassau.”
The conductor of JazzLab Ensemble 
was energetic and engaged throughout 
the entire show and seemed to be truly 
enjoying himself leading the student 
group. Wilson also kept the crowd 
entertained in the dead air between 
some of the pieces that involved 
shuffling of positions and musicians 
with backstories to some of the titles, 
as well as some impromptu stand-up 
comedy.
When SMTD senior Allison Taylor 
started singing, my throat became dry 
and my eyes began to water, as though 
I had tasted something unbelievably 
sweet beyond my gustatory capabilities. 
Taylor sang Wilson’s own arrangement 
of Victor Young’s “Stella by Starlight” 
that left the audience breathless.
SMTD 
student 
Ben 
Powell 

performed the other vocal piece of the 
set, “Don’t Worry ‘Bout Me,” that made 
me wonder if I was listening to Sinatra 
himself. Powell’s vocal performance 
came as somewhat of a surprise to 
those who were not familiar with the 
group, as Powell spent the first half of 
the performance tucked behind the 
piano, playing bass. Nonetheless, he 
slinked out from his perch and blew the 
crowd away, as he bellowed out notes 
that mimicked the bass he was playing 
just moments ago.
The group’s shining instruments 
matched the almost metallic tune. The 
golden pick-ups of Ian Thompson’s 
hollow-body guitar gleamed in the dim 
light of Rackham Auditorium.

MichiganDaily.com

Yesterday morning I was 
sitting in the dining room 
of my house, a co-op of 
20-something 
housemates 
who are always coming in 
and out. The conversations 
we have are wonderfully 
different every day. One of 
my housemates sat near me as 
I was working, and we got to 
talking about music we loved, 
and then poetry we loved, 
and then Etheridge Knight. I 
pushed my laptop across the 
table and told him to read 
“Feeling Fucked Up,” then sat 
there and tried not to seem 
too much like I was watching 
him read it, which I was.
It’s hard not to feel this way 
about any artistic work, or 
any thing, that you really like, 
and especially about Knight. 
His is the kind of work that 
doesn’t just dig under your 
skin; it starts under there, 
and it only burrows deeper, 
past the heart and to the 
spirit and the soul. Etheridge 
Knight was a major poet of 
the 20th century whose first 
two 
books, 
“Poems 
from 
Prison” and “Black Voices 
from 
Prison,” 
chronicled 
the eight years Knight spent 
incarcerated, the writing he 
produced during that time 
and the writings of his fellow 
inmates.
I’ve written columns here 
in the past about poets who 
battled systems of oppression 
and incarceration in order to 
share their feelings and ideas 
with the world, among them 
Anna Akhmatova and Nguyen 
Chí Thien. Both of these 
writers 
faced 
oppressive 
governments in their home 
countries 
(Vietnam 
and 

Russia, 
respectively), 
and 
the former emigrated to the 
United States later in his life. 
It is interesting in somewhat 
different ways to examine the 
story of Knight, whose story 
of oppression is distinctly 
and troublingly American.

Knight 
enlisted 
in 
the 
U.S. army in 1947 when he 
was only sixteen and served 
for three years as a medical 
technician in the Korean 
War. This experience left 
him 
both 
physically 
and 
psychologically traumatized, 
his trauma leading to an 
opiate addiction. A decade 
later, in 1960, Knight was 
arrested for armed robbery. 
He would spend most of the 
1960s — a socially, culturally 
and artistically pivotal time 
in America — in prison, 
before his release in 1968. 
That same year, he published 
“Poems from Prison” and 
married 
Sonia 
Sanchez, 
another major literary figure 
of the Black Arts Movement.
Knight’s 
experiences 
at 
war, his drug addiction, his 
time spent in prison — these 
were 
interlocking 
issues, 

issues that affected Knight 
all throughout his life. Yet 
what 
truly 
characterized 
his life and his work was 
his undying commitment to 
feeling and truth. He was in 
all respects a proponent of 
passion, 
whose 
persistent 
efforts to access human truth 
and spirit through language 
and poetry live on through 
his literary work and the 
effect he has had on other 
writers.
His expertise in language 
is impressive in its fluidity. 
Knight’s work is constantly 
shifting 
in 
terms 
of 
his 
approaches 
to 
form, 
structure, rhyme and other 
crucial 
poetic 
elements. 
Any avenue into his work 
might offer a different first 
impression, 
all 
more 
or 
less equally thrilling and 
captivating. 
There’s 
the 
lyricism and back-and-forth 
structure of “At a VA Hospital 
in the Middle of the United 
States of America: An Act in 
a Play,” which, like much of 
Knight’s work, carries the 
heavy implication of musical 
influence. There’s the prose-
but-not-quite 
storytelling 
of “A Fable,” and the simple, 
heart-rending 
lament 
of 
“Cell Song,” which carries 
within its four brief stanzas 
a sense of tragedy particular 
to Knight’s experience in 
prison. What Knight’s rich 
and varied array of creative 
work has in common, it shares 
with the poet himself: a 
studious and brave attention 
to the human experience, 
impossible to divorce from 
the deep natures of heart and 
soul.

FILM NOTEBOOK

NETFLIX

With “Endgame” just a month 
away, it’s time to look back at 
the most successful cinematic 
experiment of our time — the 
Marvel Cinematic Universe — from 
its billion dollar cinematic heights 
to its most minor TV outings, to see 
how well they tell their stories with 
the means available to them.
44. “Marvel’s Iron Fist”: Season 
1 (2017)
Before its release, “Iron Fist” 
was staring down a whitewashing 
controversy 
and 
the 
weight 
of having to build up to “The 
Defenders,” and it blinked. Hard. 
The characters, with the notable 
exception of Jessica Henwick’s 
Colleen 
Wing, 
are 
largely 
unlikeable and saddled with boring 
storylines, and the fight scenes that 
should have been the lifeblood of 
the series are perhaps the most 
incompetent in the entire MCU. 
Come for the mystical kung-fu, stay 
for the endless board meetings.
43. 
“Marvel’s 
Inhumans”: 
Season 1 (2017)
The first and only season of 
“Inhumans” is the very definition of 
“cheap,” which is doubly surprising 
when you remember that this was 
originally announced as a Phase 
Three film to be released between 
“Infinity War” and “Endgame.” 
Someone at Marvel must have 
realized what a stinker they had 
on their hands, so they slashed the 
budget and exiled it to ABC. This is 
a show that stars alien superheroes 
from the Moon and decides to send 
them to Hawaii for a fish out of 
water story. The only thing worse 
than the writing are the visuals, the 
ugliest in the MCU.
42. 
“Marvel’s 
Runaways”: 
Season 2 (2018)
After a full first season in which 
the titular Runaways never actually 
ran 
away, 
the 
superpowered 
teenagers at the center of the show 
finally escape their evil parents 
and proceed to do nothing but 
argue, keep secrets and argue about 
keeping secrets for an insufferable 
slog of a sophomore season. Other 
shows usually need a full twenty-
plus episode season to reach this 
level 
of 
directionless 
tedium. 
Season two of “Runaways” does it 

in thirteen.
41. “Marvel’s The Punisher”: 
Season 2 (2019)
The second season of “The 
Punisher” has thirteen episodes 
and enough plot to fill half of that. 
The opening salvo is resolutely 
solid with brutal action and another 
wounded performance from Jon 
Bernthal, but the interesting story 
it sets up about far-right extremists 
is quickly abandoned for a return 
to New York City and a protracted 
and predictable game of cat-and-
amnesiac-mouse between Frank 
and Billy Russo.
40. “Iron Man 2” (2010)
The worst film in the MCU is 
one of its earliest, a movie that uses 
most of its runtime to put the pieces 
in place for the rest of the universe 
while 
neglecting 
to 
actually 
develop a story of its own. At any 
given moment there are something 
like three storylines all vying for 
attention, and most of them end in 
anticlimax. Remember Whiplash? 
Sam Rockwell’s Justin Hammer? 
Tony’s dad leaving him the plans 
for a new element in the layout for 
his off-brand world’s fair? Good, 
because Marvel doesn’t want you 
to.
39. “Marvel’s Runaways”: Season 
1 (2017)
This show is called “Runaways.” 
It is composed of 10 episodes. It 
takes until the final moments of 
the first season for the characters 
to actually run away. At about 
fifty minutes per episode and 
ten episodes per season, that’s 
499 minutes “Runaways” spends 
spinning its wheels when it could be 
using its outstanding cast to adapt 
one of Marvel’s most inventive 
comics. The first few episodes are 
interesting, but after that, it loses 
steam with almost breathtaking 
speed.
38. “Thor: The Dark World” 
(2013)
There’s an argument to be 
made that “The Dark World” is a 
worse movie than “Iron Man 2,” 
but “The Dark World” at least has 
a single central story. So there’s 
that. Otherwise, this is a lot of 
what people who hate the MCU 
hate about the MCU. The villain 
is paper thin, the action is flat and 
the excellent cast is wasted in the 
movie’s desperation to get more 
banter between Thor and Loki.

37. “The Incredible Hulk” (2008)
“The Incredible Hulk” is the 
redheaded stepchild of the MCU, 
not because it’s the worst movie, 
but 
because 
everyone 
forgets 
about it until Wikipedia reminds 
them of its existence. Edward 
Norton famously butted heads 
with director Louis Leterrier on 
set and would eventually hijack the 
movie to create his own cut, and 
the friction between director and 
star shows in the complete lack of 
humanity in a story that’s supposed 
to be about one man’s struggle to 
retain his humanity.
36. “Marvel’s Agent Carter”: 
Season 2 (2016)
If “Agent Carter” were a Netflix 
show and able to more fully lean 
into its postwar noir trappings, 
it might be something special. 
Instead, it’s another ABC show 
with a ludicrously great star and a 
shiny coat of paint to cover up the 
fact that it’s more of the same sorts 
of stories. Peggy Carter deserves 
better than playing second fiddle to 
“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”
35. “Marvel’s Iron Fist”: Season 
2 (2018)
The second season of “Iron Fist” 
is such a dramatic improvement 
on the first that you might 
mistake it for good at first glance. 
Unfortunately, while the pacing is 
better and some of the characters 
are more palatable, others are 
introduced to at least partially 
counteract that, including Alice 
Eve’s Typhoid Mary, who you know 
is evil because she has dissociative 
identity disorder.
34. “Marvel’s Jessica Jones”: 
Season 2 (2018)
So much of the second season 
of “Jessica Jones” is good — Jess’s 
headway in confronting her trauma 
and her relationship with her 
mother are emotional high points 
brought home by Krysten Ritter’s 
winning performance — but the 
rest of the season is an unfocused 
mess of forced drama that follows 
one of the MCU’s high points with 
one of its nadirs.
The journey continues next 
week with some of the MCU’s more 
minor successes. The franchise’s 
first forays into TV are revealed 
and a handful of pleasant if 
forgettable movies show why the 
Marvel formula works even when 
it stumbles.

For those of who may not 
know, Billie Eilish is a teen pop 
icon, but not your typical 17-year-
old pop star. She was 13 when 
she recorded her first viral hit 
“Ocean Eyes” with her brother 
at home. Over the last year, her 
anonymity has evaded her, with 
her Instagram nearing 16 million 
followers and her music gaining 
wider recognition, appearing on 
late night shows and 
movie 
soundtracks. 
At 17 with a billion 
streams, she’s found 
her 
way 
to 
the 
mainstream with the 
release of her debut 
album WHEN WE 
ALL FALL ASLEEP, 
WHERE DO WE GO?.
Eilish 
reaches 
fame at a point where 
teen pop is losing the 
strange, problematic 
sex appeal that’s been associated 
with it since “... Baby One 
More Time.” Given the very 
independent and digital nature of 
her rise, it only makes sense — her 
appeal was never attached to any 
sense of sexiness. She never had 
to adhere to any sort of archetype 
the way stars like Miley Cyrus 
had to. Eilish’s appeal presents 
itself in a sense of realness, how 
much her words feel like those 
of a 17-year-old. She’ll look you 
dead in the eye with a resting 
bitch face in Instagram photos 
and (at least pretend she) won’t 
give a shit if you don’t like her. 
She has approached her celebrity 
differently 
from 
artists 
like 
Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd and 
Odd Future who built their own 
multifaceted universe for fans 
to delve into and obsess over 
through 
merchandise, 
social 
media and song references. Given 
the context, the album is imbued 
in all the teen angst you’d expect 
from a 17-year-old. But don’t 
think that leaves Eilish’s work 
void of any artistic merit.

The music streams by like 
a static, ambient sheet that 
crinkles abruptly. At points, 
there’s 
an 
instrumental 
sameness, one sound carrying a 
song nearly all the way through. 
This isn’t to say the song lacks 
variety, but that there’s a large 
dependency on syncopation. It’s 
a hazy, subtle sound composed 
of sparse 808’s, a vaguely trappy 
beat or twinkly percussion and a 
muffled, mumbly voice. But the 
beat switch-ups are prominent 
and 
unexpected, 
occurring 

sometimes in the middle of a 
song (think more Swimming by 
Mac Miller, less “Sicko Mode”). 
Namely, there’s the latest single 
“bad guy” that quickly turns 
from the playful, blithe sneering 
of a former partner to a dark, 
investment in his loneliness 
expressed in the lyrics as well 
as the beat. There are also 
surprisingly tactful splashes of 
jazz that blend into some of the 
songs to elevate the playful, more 
friendly demeanor behind this 
otherwise solemn and evocative 
album.
The album has its moments 
of playful gusto. It starts with 
introduction “!!!!!!!,” featuring 
slurping noises followed by Eilish 
exclaiming, “I have taken out my 
invisalign!” We are reassured 
that this is indeed a serious 
album by the time we reach the 
second track, though glimmers 
of goofiness shine throughout the 
first half of the project, “all the 
good girls go to hell” ending with 
Eilish humming out the last few 
beats in the song and yelling out, 

“I cannot do this snowflake!” in a 
mocking voice. An undercurrent 
of anxiety and trepidation creeps 
around the content. “xanny” 
mocks the party anthem but 
ponders the possibility of drug 
use and overdose, asking “what is 
it about them?” Similarly, “all the 
good girls go to hell” is sly in its 
exploration of menace but zones 
in on real world issues like sea 
levels rising and forests burning 
in California.
The second half takes a more 
despondent turn. The tempo is 
noticeably 
slower, 
somber almost ballad 
like at some points. 
Here, 
Eilish 
takes 
on 
more 
personal 
topics, 
the 
music 
bleak, sparse, almost 
detached but emotive 
in lyricism. The fears 
expressed in the first 
half 
are 
revisited 
here, amplified and 
put into perspective. 
“listen before i go” 
is a standout track, a quivering, 
sheer beat echoing in the back 
along with vague sirens and 
chattering following the opening 
line, “Take me to the rooftop.” 
She croons, “Call my friends and 
tell them that I love them / And 
I’ll miss them, but I’m not sorry,” 
helplessly. “ilomilo” is another 
highlight, formerly teased in the 
“bury a friend” music video with 
its danceable intro that slowly 
dwindles to a gloomy, shivering 
percussion.
Despite 
the 
shifts 
and 
nontraditional risks WHEN WE 
ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO 
WE GO? takes, it proves a strong 
debut from Billie Eilish that 
appeals beyond the artist’s brand. 
It operates as a progression 
towards a dispirited end, but 
with elegance and nuance, tying 
the whole craft into one cohesive 
masterpiece. Despite her age and 
the angsty hype surrounding 
Eillish’s celebrity, her first album 
proves that she is a force to be 
reckoned with in the music 
world.

‘When We Fall Asleep’ is a
nuanced debut from Eilish

ALBUM REVIEW

DIANA YASSIN
Daily Arts Writer

“What I’m Listening To” is a new series by The Daily’s Music beat 
in which our staff writers share what they’re playing on repeat with 
readers. It’s a place for writers to plug in, turn up and let the world 
know what truly rocks. 
This week, Blowout Comb by Digable Planets has been bringing 
my consciousness into a higher plane. I’m only being a little 
dramatic when I say you don’t listen to Blowout Comb — you 
experience it.
A diverse range of groovy samples were chopped and 
spliced with lush and lovely live instrumentation to produce a 
groundbreaking jazz-rap record in Blowout Comb. The rap trio 
moved to Brooklyn in the early ’90s with the express purpose 
of joining the hip-hop renaissance; group leader Butterfly 
affectionately called New York “a Mecca for rappers.” And join 
the renaissance they did, crafting a cool, surreal sound that few 
other artists were even dabbling in.
Blowout Comb slipped under the radar when it released in 1994. 
Understandably so — many consider ’94 to be rap’s greatest year 
of all time. Three of hip hop’s most iconic debut albums dropped: 
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik by Outkast, Ready to Die by The 
Notorious B.I.G. and Illmatic by Nas. Common, Scarface, Method 
Man, Beastie Boys, Pete Rock & CL Smooth and Gang Starr all 
came out with classics in the same year. Amid all the competition, 
Digable Planets came out with an iconic signature sound. Blowout 
Comb is a marriage of jazz and hip hop that has proven to be a 
match made in heaven.
I can gush about the jazzy sonics for hours on end, but what 
truly makes this album important is its lyrical themes: it is both 
supremely empowering of the Black community and sincerely 
conscious of the realities they face. Right from the beginning on 

“The May 4th Movement,” following a grandiose trumpet intro, 
Doodlebug and Ladybug reference Illmatic (Nas’s masterpiece 
narrative of drug violence in the Queensbridge projects) and give 
a shout-out to notorious Black Power movement prisoners Mumia 
Abu-Jamal and Sekou Odinga. Including the title, a reference to 
student anti-imperialist protests in China in 1919, there are layers 
of political meaning to pick apart right from the beginning.
Today in hip hop there’s a constant debate about accessibility 
versus substance. On one hand, not everybody always wants 
to absorb some mega-conscious music with layers of lyrical 
complexity. But on the other hand, maybe relaxing to substanceless 
lo-fi beats or partying to the tune of “Gucci Gang” is depleting brain 
cells. Both ends of the argument are holier-than-thou bullshit, but 
for those who play into it that want a little bit of both, there are 
truckloads of music at hand. For a contemporary example, take 
Kendrick Lamar’s Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City. Almost every track on 
the album can be a) blasted from the car while you scream out 
the window, or b) listened to closely to see a poignant cultural 
message about poverty and gang culture. Likewise, almost every 
track on Blowout Comb can a) soothe your soul as you enter the 5th 
dimension, or b) reveal serious tension and contemplation in the 
Black community.
For years, rap critics and music journalists have chosen 
“overtly political” as their favorite buzzword-phrase to describe 
this album, but I think that’s less-than-fitting. The three subtle 
emcees are clearly sending a message, but simultaneously they 
smoothly slide slick stories and meta raps about drug-doing, 
party-having, Brooklyn-living and hip hop-loving. “Overtly 
political” makes it sound like you’re getting slammed with the 
group’s Black nationalist rhetoric and 5-percenter slang, but at 
the end of the day you can get whatever the fuck you want out of 
this album.
This week, I’m listening to Blowout Comb. I think next week 
I’ll re-read “The Autobiography of Malcom X.” It’s the natural 
progression of things.

Listening to Digable Planets, relax

DO WE GO?

Wolverines continue historic run with win over Johns Hopkins

Amid a season of firsts for the 

Wolverines, they added another.

When the No. 8 Michigan 

women’s lacrosse team (13-0 
overall, 3-0 Big Ten) took the field 
on Saturday afternoon, not only 
was it putting its perfect record 
on the line –– it was seeking 
its first win in program history 
against No. 18 Johns Hopkins 
(8-3, 1-1). And led by an offensive 
outburst from sophomore attacker 
Caitlin Muir and sophomore 
midfielder Maggie Kane, the 
Wolverines powered their way to 
a 16-11 victory at U-M Lacrosse 
Stadium.

“It’s a team we haven’t beaten 

before,” said Michigan coach 
Hannah Nielsen. “It’s a team 
that came in and beat us at 
home last year, so you know, the 
girls were playing a little bit of 
revenge there. And they did great. 
They’re showing up every game 
and there’s things to tweak each 

game, but we’ve been doing that 
and today is a big one for the 
program.”

As the final seconds of the 

possession clock were winding 
down at the end of the first half, 
the Wolverines found themselves 
in position to take their first lead 
of the afternoon. Michigan, which 
dug itself into an early 5-2 deficit, 
now had Johns Hopkins on the 
ropes after rattling off three 
straight goals to tie the game.

When the possession clock 

reached single digits, sophomore 
attacker Caitlin Muir found 
daylight inside the 8-meter arc. 
Muir curled around the back of 
the net and emerged on the left 
side of Blue Jays’ goalkeeper 
Haley Crosson. She drifted 
toward the center of the arc, fired 
and found the back of the net to 
give the Wolverines their first 
lead of the afternoon, 6-5, with 
14.8 seconds remaining in the 
half.

“Well we got the ball,” Nielsen 

said. “I think that was a big thing 
(that led to the four-goal stretch). 

Our defense had an awesome 
first 10 minutes of the game and 
only held them to a few goals. 
And really whenever we got the 
ball we were throwing it away. 
We couldn’t win a draw control 
and once we started doing that, 
we had the ball and we knew we 
could score goals and that’s what 
happened.”

The early stages of Saturday 

afternoon’s contest were 
controlled by the Blue Jays. 
They retained possession, 
easily worked their way into 
their offensive sets and limited 
Michigan to just two goals 
through the first 20 minutes of 
the game. But as its grasp on 
possession loosened, so did Johns 
Hopkins’ control of the game.

With under eight minutes 

remaining in the half, Muir 
ignited the Wolverines’ four-goal 
streak that ended the first half. 
She weaved her way into the arc 
and rifled a shot past Crosson 
for her first of six goals on the 
afternoon. The sophomore, who 
recorded seven points in total, 

increased her season goal total 
to 22 and also recorded her 17th 
assist of the season.

“I definitely couldn’t have done 

it without my team, obviously,” 
Muir said. “But my team kept 
opening up alleys and giving me 
the ball, so it was really nice. They 
opened it all up for me.”

Added Nielsen: “She’s not big 

in size but she’s big in presence … 
her composure, her athleticism, 
her dodging ability, she works on 
a lot outside of practice and it’s 
great to see her get rewarded. Six 
goals in a huge game is a really 
good effort by her.”

Both sides exchanged goals 

during the opening stages of the 
second half, keeping the score 
tight at 9-8 before Michigan 
finally put the game away. A 
five-goal stretch later in the half 
propelled the Wolverines to a 
16-9 lead with under four minutes 
remaining.

Kane was a contributing factor 

in the second half, pouring in all 
four of her goals in the second 
frame to go along with two assists 

on the afternoon. She tied her 
career high with six points on 
Saturday.

Michigan is continuing to 

improve upon its previous season-
best record of 7-10, remaining 
undefeated ahead of next 
weekend’s matchup against No. 2 
Maryland.

“It’s just all excitement right 

now,” said junior midfielder 
Molly Garrett. “This year 
has been a big year of 
just redemption 
from the years 
past of losing 
all these 
games. And 
coming out 
here where 
this is a big 
opportunity 
to get 
redemption 
as well as go 
to the Big Ten 
and being able 
to get that done 
is just very exciting 
for us.”

What to do now that Michigan’s season is over

F

or the 103rd time in a 
row, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s season 
ended.
Such is 
the futility of 
sports. But, 
hey, you never 
know. Maybe 
the 104th sea-
son will never 
end.
In the 
meantime, 
now begins 
the weird 
space in time after a sports sea-
son ends in which people don’t 
really know what to do with 
themselves.
That’s why I’m here. I’ve spent 
the last few days brainstorming 
things you can look forward to in 
the next few weeks and months 
that will get you through this 
trying time.
(Note: Liverpool is going to 
win the Premier League, which 
I will spend the next month 
agonizing over, but I realize that 
isn’t applicable to everybody, so I 
left it out.)
Here’s what I came up with!
The Final Four
Basketball isn’t over, despite 
Michigan fans’ current feeling of 
emptiness.
And, even better, Wolverine 
fans likely have a rooting interest 
now that Michi-
gan State beat 
Duke.
Even if that 
isn’t the case for 
everybody, there 
should be some 
elite games, and 
even if you don’t 
like basketball, 
you can at least 
drink beer and 
watch with 
friends or whatever you like to 
do. Yippee!
Baseball season is starting
Like it or not, there is not a 
single sport on Earth that takes 

up as much time as baseball.
Even for all its faults, every 
baseball game takes at least three 
hours, and you can waste the 
next six months watching that 
stuff.
Sure, the Detroit Tigers are 
seemingly in tank mode, but 
other teams are good. Join a 
fantasy league! Buy in! At the 
very least, you can bide your time 
until football season by research-
ing Avisail Garcia and Kole Cal-
houn’s respective slash lines and 
deciding who warrants a start.
The Michigan football team 
has a new offensive coordina-
tor
Despite your feeling of emp-
tiness that accompanies the 
Wolverines’ exit from the NCAA 
Tournament, there may be some 
great silver lining down the road.
Michigan hired Josh Gattis to 
lead its offense this season, and 
if his #SpeedInSpace promises 
are to be believed, the Wolver-
ines could have an exciting, new 
offensive look this season.
Maybe that spells the end 
of Michigan’s drought against 
Ohio State and the long-awaited 
return to national prominence. 
Maybe it doesn’t.
Either way, this time before 
the football season is at least 
good for some hope. So look at 
those recruiting boards! Map 
out how badly the Wolverines 
will have to beat 
Middle Tennes-
see State for you 
to feel good about 
things!
Game of 
Thrones is 
returning
(This section 
has a spoiler 
warning, but if 
you aren’t caught 
up by now then 
what are you even doing?)
Alright, we’ll get away from 
sports for a bit and move to 
something that everyone alive 
enjoys.

Game of Thrones returns on 
April 14!
Who will sit atop the Iron 
Throne? Will 
Cersei meet the 
fate we’re all 
hoping for? Will 
Arya check all the 
names off her list? 
Will there be vio-
lence and death?
The answer is 
that I don’t know 
(except for the last 
question, to which 
the answer is most 
definitely yes). But the point is 
that the questions don’t matter. 
You’re going to watch it, and 
you’re going to love it no matter 
what they throw out there.

I’m going to graduate
I don’t want to jinx it, I guess, 
but I’m currently on track to 
graduate this 
semester.
I realize this 
has absolutely 
nothing to do 
with any of you 
readers, but I 
figure there are 
two ways of 
looking at this:
1) You don’t 
care about me at 
all, and you’re 
actually quite annoyed that I 
wrote this and that you’ve read 
this far. In this case, the posi-
tive is that I will be gone when I 
graduate, and you won’t feel obli-

gated to read my articles with the 
hope that I’ll give some sort of 
insight about Michigan sports.
2) You are my mother — the 
only person I can definitely say is 
both reading this and cares deep-
ly for my well-being. In this case, 
the positive is that you won’t 
have to pay my college tuition for 
much longer.
In either scenario, my Venmo 
is at the bottom of the article. I 
will consider quitting The Daily 
harder for every dollar I earn.
Miscellaneous
There’s probably going to be 
some good music released this 
summer. That should be cool.
You might meet the love of 
your life in the near future. Per-
haps you’ve already done that, 

and you think you’re better than 
me.
If that — along with the other 
reasons — isn’t good enough for 
you, at least the Earth might 
cease to exist as we know it.
The cause could be anything. 
Climate change, the reversal of 
the magnetic poles, nuclear war-
fare. It’s a scary world out there.
So when you think about it, 
the Wolverines’ loss in the Tour-
nament doesn’t really matter 
that much. There’s always a light 
— or a great eternal darkness — 
at the end of the tunnel.

PERSAK

Michigan breezes past UC Irvine

Matthew Whitaker landed 
firmly on his feet and didn’t 
move an inch. The senior let 
out a yell and pumped his fist 
before moving to celebrate 
his stuck dismount from the 
still rings with his teammates 
on the No. 3 Michigan men’s 
gymnastics team.
Two rotations later, Whitaker 
once again completed a routine 
— this time on the parallel 
bars — with his feet glued to 
the floor. This time, when his 
teammates swarmed him to 
celebrate 
his 
performance, 
there was an extra level of 
emotion.
It was the final regular-
season routine of Whitaker’s 
career with the Wolverines.
His 
career-
high 
score 
of 
14.150 
on 
the 
parallel bars won 
the event and was 
one of his two 
podium finishes 
in 
Michigan’s 
Senior 
Day 
meet 
against 
No. 18 UIC. The 
Wolverines won, 
406.200-367.750.
“(Whitaker) 
really 
came 
through today,” said Michigan 
coach Kurt Golder. “I’m very, 
very happy for him. He has 
trouble sometimes. He lets 
the nerves get to him — or the 
nerves get to him. I don’t think 
he does it voluntarily. But yeah, 
I’m very happy that he handled 
the situation today.”
Coming into Saturday’s meet 
against the Flames, Golder 
intended to give all eight of the 
Wolverines’ graduating seniors 
a chance to compete one last 
time. Some of them, including 
Whitaker, 
do 
so 
relatively 
sparingly, 
but 
against 
the 
Flames, Golder knew he had the 
ability to be flexible with his 
lineup.
UIC’s high score this season 
is 370.300 — more than 40 
points below Michigan’s best 
mark of 413.900.
“They’re not the strongest 

team we meet,” Golder said. 
“We like to use that so that if we 
want to experiment with a new 
routine, we can. We’re not going 
against Oklahoma or Illinois or 
one of the powers. And then 
that way we can also get our 
seniors in, too. Your senior class 
isn’t 
always 
your strongest 
lineup, 
so 
it 
serves 
that 
purpose 
as 
well.”
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
win, 
seven 
of 
the 
eight 
seniors 
competed 
and 
six 
of 
them 
earned spots on the podium. In 
total, Michigan earned the top 
three placings on all six events 
and UIC’s lone podium finish 
came in the all-around.
But despite the large margin 
of 
victory, 
the 
Wolverines found 
difficulty in at 
least one or two 
routines on every 
event. 
Golder prefers 
his team to have 
major 
mistakes, 
such as a fall, at 
most two times 
in a single meet. 
Saturday, though, 
Michigan 
had 
five 
major 
mistakes.
Senior Emyre Cole missed 
the Wolverines’ three previous 
meets as a result of a violation 
of team rules, and his time away 
from competition was evident in 

his up-and-down performance. 
He fell dismounting from the 
still rings and again attempting 
a release move on high bar.
But Cole also turned in a 
score of 14.650 on vault and won 
the event, in addition to placing 
second on floor and in the all-
around.
“Pretty 
good, 
but 
not 
perfect,” Golder said of Cole’s 
performance. “Maybe not in 
quite good enough shape yet. 
He got ready as best he could 
when you’re not competing, but 
competing and doing it in the 
gym are different things.”
Just as Cole was imperfect, 
so was Michigan. The Big Ten 
Championships 
loom 
next 
week, and the Wolverines will 
look to win the meet for the first 
time since 2014 when they won 
both the Big Ten and NCAA 
Championships. After making 
mistakes 
on 
more 
routines 
than usual against UIC, the 
pressure is on 
for 
Michigan 
to improve.
But 
Golder 
prefers it that 
way.
“I 
would 
rather that we 
don’t have the 
perfect 
meet, 
but 
kinda 
close, 
and 
I 
think 
that’s 
what we were,” Golder said. “I 
think it’s better that way than 
to have the perfect meet today 
and go into Big Tens thinking 
you’re all that. Better to have a 
little pressure on, a little more 
concern.”

Wolverines adjust to spring racing

BELLEVILLE — While the 
No. 9 Michigan rowing team 
had success this fall at regattas 
like Head of the Charles, in 
this weekend’s season opener 
against Yale and Harvard, the 
Wolverines faced a new beast 
entirely: the spring race. 
In the fall, the rowers race 
between four and six kilometers, 
while spring races are almost 
always two kilometers. This 
change affects practically every 
aspect of the race from the very 
first stroke. 
The officials called the start 
in Saturday’s 1V8 race against 
Yale, and both boats were off. 
Sophomore coxswain Charlotte 
Powers called out the starting 
sequence, followed by the high 
strokes — an element unique 
to spring racing that Michigan 
began practicing earlier this 
week.
While 
Powers 
felt 
good 
about her boat’s start, Yale still 
managed to inch out ahead 
within the first 30 seconds. 
“We did a great job executing 
(the start) today but I think we 
need to continue working on 
staying internal,” said senior 
Kathryn Grotto. “Not focusing 
on what other boats are doing 
and just rowing our own race.”

Yale maintained its marginal 
lead as the boats passed the 1000 
meter mark, but the Wolverines 
weren’t giving up. 
“Our game plan going in was 
to stay really composed through 
the first 1500 (meters),” Grotto 
said. “And then, once we get to 
500 left, we’re just going to see 
where we’re at on the other boat 
and just do whatever we have to 
do.”
With 500 meters to go, Powers 
decided it was time for her boat 
to make a move. 
A smile broke over her face 
as she reflected on those last 
500 meters, in which Michigan 
attempted a sprint for the first 
time this year. This risk paid 
off as it walked back on Yale, 
crossing the finish line first by 
less than a second. 
“We were down the whole 
race and we, as a boat, at the 
last 500 decided we were going 
to try to stop them from moving 
up anymore,” Powers said. “We 
just inched into them. We have 
the tiniest, best stroke ever, 
(freshman) Jess Schoonbee, and 
I just kept telling her to take the 
rate up every couple of strokes 
and she responded every time 
and, so we came in through the 
line at a 42 (strokes per minute).” 
Not only are the rowers 
adjusting 
to 
the 
inherent 
differences of spring racing — 

like the start and the sprint — but 
also to a new lineup. While many 
of the 1V8 raced together at the 
Head of the Charles in the fall, 
Michigan coach Mark Rothstein 
made a couple of changes, 
including putting Schoonbee in 
the stroke seat. 
Although Schoonbee is the 
only freshman in the 1V8, as 
stroke seat, she is responsible for 
setting the pace for the rest of the 
boat. While in the fall, rowers 
typically race between 26 and 30 
strokes per minute, during spring 
racing, the rate is ratcheted up to 
anywhere from 32 to 38 strokes 
per minute — even higher during 
the sprint. This increase puts 
pressure on the eight seat to find 
the perfect balance between 
speed and control as they move 
up the slide. 
This weekend, Schoonbee did 
just that.
“(Schoonbee) did great — very 
composed,” Rothstein said. “I 
thought the whole boat rowed 
a really composed race. We got 
down, but there was no panic.”
Rothstein believes it was that 
calm and composure that carried 
Michigan from the start, through 
the thousand, into the last 500 
meters — ultimately past the 
finish line first. 
If this race is any indication, 
the Wolverines won’t have any 
trouble with the adjustment.

Four home runs lift Michigan past 
Michigan State in 16-2 blowout win

On 
Saturday, 
Michigan’s 
offense put a dent in the Ray 
Fisher Stadium fence’s self-
esteem.
The Wolverines (19-7 overall, 
2-0 Big Ten) hit four home runs 
in their 16-2 victory over in-state 
rival Michigan State (4-20, 0-5).
The air show started in 
the first inning, when junior 
outfielder 
Jordan 
Brewer 
walked up to the plate with two 
outs. On the second pitch, he 
launched a long, arcing home 
run over the left-center fence 
as two Spartans stood to watch 
it — arms helplessly grasping the 
padded wall. It was 1-0 after the 
first inning, and Michigan never 
looked back.
The 
next 
inning, 
the 
Wolverines continued to flex 
their 
muscles; 
senior 
first-
baseman Jimmy Kerr launched 
a solo shot to right field that 
took three seconds to leave the 
field. In the bottom of the third 
Michigan’s offense put a team 
effort together to score four 
runs. 
Sophomore 
outfielder 
Jesse 
Franklin 
and 
junior 
designated 
hitter 
Dominic 
Clementi worked their way to 
second and third base.
Brewer came up to the plate, 
and in his second at-bat, he 
sent a long fly ball to right-
center field for a sacrifice fly. 
Senior outfielder Miles Lewis 
followed up with a double down 
the right-field line to score the 
Wolverines’ second run of the 
inning. Waiting patiently, Lewis 
trotted into home base after 
Kerr launched his second home 
run of the game to dead center, 
easily clearing the barrier 395 
feet away to put Michigan up, 
6-0.
After their first scoreless 
inning of the night in the fourth, 
the 
Wolverines 
posted 
five 
runs to extend the lead to 11-2, 

headlined by sophomore catcher 
Joe 
Donovan’s 
high-hanging 
pop-up that somehow made it 
over the left-center field fence 
for a three-run home run.
The 
offensive 
explosion, 
though, didn’t hide Michigan’s 
pitching struggles.
Beginning in the first inning, 
junior 
right-hander 
Karl 
Kauffman flirted with danger, 
putting a base-
runner 
on 
first 
and 
second 
in 
each of the first 
two innings only 
to 
have 
good 
defensive 
plays 
get him out of 
trouble.
In the second 
inning, 
for 
example, 
he 
walked Michigan 
State’s Reese Trahey, allowed 
a hard hit single against Casey 
Mayes and a long fly out from 
Adam Proctor that surely would 
have advanced Trahey to third if 
not for Brewer’s bullet of a throw 
from just in front of the right 
field warning track to third base 
for an impressive double play.
“What should be a normal 
play that would advance the 
runner from second to third and 
create a scoring opportunity for 
them,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “For him to show off a 
really tremendous and accurate 
arm, that was a huge, big time 
momentum play.”
The defense couldn’t save 
Kauffmann in the fourth inning, 
though. Walking two batters 
and throwing two wild pitches, 
he allowed two runs. The next 
inning, Kauffmann threw one 
more wild pitch and allowed one 
more walk — the rain affecting 
his accuracy.
Kauffmann wasn’t the only 
one thrown off by the moisture. 
Freshman 
left-hand 
reliever 
Walker Cleveland had three 
wild-pitches and two walks, 

managing to avoid letting a run 
in in the seventh inning despite 
loading the bases.
“We have never done that 
before,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“That 
many wild pitches, that many 
spiked fastballs and curveballs. 
If it becomes a problem, we’ll 
address it. Otherwise we’ll just 
leave it at that.”
Yet the offense still couldn’t 
be 
slowed 
down.
“Kerr, 
a 
senior captain 
to 
go 
5-for-
5, 
with 
two 
doubles, 
two 
home runs and 
really 
spark 
our 
offense,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“It was great to 
see our offense 
click up and down the lineup and 
on the bench.”
It seemed every bat swung 
made contact — demoralizing 
the Spartans. It wasn’t just the 
fence that felt worthless.

Wolverine offense finding its swing

Last 
year, 
the 
Michigan 
baseball team lived and died by 
its offense. 
In the first 15 games of the 
season, a stretch over which 
the Wolverines went 4-11, the 
offense averaged just 4.5 runs 
per game; in eight of those 
games, Michigan scored three 
runs or fewer. Over the next 20 
games — in which the Wolverines 
went undefeated — they almost 
doubled that, averaging 8.4 runs 
per game and scoring 168 runs 
total over that stretch. 
When the offense struggled 
with consistency over the last 
third of the season and into the 
postseason, Michigan’s success 
cooled off, too, leading the 
Wolverines to a disappointing 
early exit in the Big Ten 
Tournament.
But this season, Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich is confident in 
his team’s offense.
“We have a lot of individual 
hitters that did a very good job of 
adding some size, some strength, 
and 
some 
explosiveness 
in 

the weight room, and that has 
translated with more bat speed 
and exit velocity amongst our 
hitters,” Bakich said. “It’s a little 
bit of an older team, so I see a 
group of kids who’ve had another 
birthday, who’ve gotten stronger, 
who’ve become more physical. 
So I would like to think we’re 
capable of hitting for more power 
this year.”
Now, his team, sitting at 19-7 
and 2-0 in the Big Ten, is starting 
to show why. 
Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense struggled 
with consistency 
throughout 
much 
of 
the 
first 
third 
of 
the season, they 
showed 
flashes 
of 
potential 
recently: 
a 
12-2 
win 
over 
Binghamton, 
a 
9-1 victory over the Citadel and a 
7-5 defeat of No. 1 UCLA. 
But as the team heads into Big 
Ten play, it looks like Michigan’s 
offense is coming into its own. 
It exploded for 23 runs over 

Manhattan, scored 12 against 
Western Michigan and scored 
16 runs against both Stetson and 
Michigan State. 
“We’ve had a lot of great 
offensive 
performances,” 
Bakich said. “It’s great to see the 
contributions up and down the 
lineup and off the bench.”
The 
team’s 
rivalry 
series 
against 
the 
Spartans 
this 
weekend embodies the rhythm 
this offense is starting to find. In 
Friday’s game in East Lansing, 
Michigan 
cruised 
past 
Michigan 
State 
to a 6-3 win in its 
Big Ten opener. 
The Wolverines 
got on the board 
first with two 
runs in the third 
inning and added 
one 
more 
run 
in 
the 
fourth. 
Michigan 
State 
answered with two runs of its 
own in the bottom of the fourth, 
but Michigan was unshaken, 
adding two runs in the fifth and 
another in the eighth on its way 
to a comfortable victory.
Saturday’s contest was in 
Ann Arbor, and the Wolverines 
certainly seemed to channel 
the energy of the home crowd 
despite the steady rain as the 
offense erupted for 16 runs. 
Senior infielder Jimmy Kerr led 
the team, going 5-for-5 with two 
home runs, two doubles and a 
long single to right field.
“When you get a senior 
captain go 5-for-5 with two 
doubles and two home runs like 
that — it really just sparked our 
offense,” Bakich said. 
As the Wolverines head into 
some of their tougher matchups 
of the year — next weekend’s 
home series against Minnesota 
and an away series at rival Ohio 
State the following weekend — 
the offense is beginning to settle 
in at exactly the right time. 
If it can stay consistent in this 
rhythm, Michigan may not die by 
its offense anytime soon.

In 35 years as the head coach 
of the Michigan softball team, 
Carol Hutchins has never lost to 
Rutgers. Entering the weekend, 
she had 15 victories in 15 tries 
dating back to 1983.
Over the weekend, Hutchins 
put her unblemished record on 
the line when the 23rd-ranked 
Wolverines (23-10 overall, 6-0 
Big Ten) traveled to Piscataway 
for a three-game set. Led by first-
year head coach and former SEC 
Player of the Year Kristen Butler, 
the new-look Scarlet Knights 
(16-17, 0-6) looked to tarnish 
Hutchins’ perfect mark against 
them.
No such dent was made. 
Michigan swept Rutgers on its 
own turf, outscoring the Scarlet 
Knights by a combined 18 runs 
in the process. The final scores 
of 10-2, 7-0 and 7-4 extended the 
Wolverines’ winning streak to 11 
games.
The 
journey 
to 
Rutgers 
marked Michigan’s first true 
road trip since the beginning of 
March, but the Wolverines aced 
the midseason road test, to say 
the least.
Despite playing its furthest 
conference series from Ann 
Arbor, Michigan didn’t need any 
time to settle in. The Wolverines 
plated a total of nine first-inning 
runs in the three games, giving 
sophomore left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien and freshman right-
hander Alex Storako comfortable 
cushions 
before 
they 
even 
stepped foot into the circle.
“Scoring those runs early on 
really sets the tone and really 
sets great energy for the entire 
game,” said freshman left fielder 
Lexie Blair. “We want to keep 
that energy. You never want to 
let up, and setting the tone in 
games at this level is huge. It 
really helps the energy in the 
dugout and for the team.”
While Blair reached base in all 
three of her first-inning at-bats, 
it was senior first baseman Alex 
Sobczak who stole the show. 
Batting in the cleanup spot, she 

recorded a pair of RBI singles 
and a three-run blast in her 
three first-inning at-bats.
Sobczak’s 
first-inning 
production only marked the 
beginning 
of 
a 
monstrous 
weekend. She amassed six hits 
in nine at-bats, including three 
home runs, nine RBI and five 
runs scored in the series. After 
starting the season on the bench, 
Sobczak is now batting .385 
with a team-high .708 slugging 
percentage and .535 on-base 
percentage. 
If 
the 
season 
ended 
today, 
her 
on-base 
plus 
slugging 
percentage 
(1.243) 
would 
be the highest 
the program has 
seen since 2016 
National 
Player 
of 
the 
Year 
Sierra 
Romero 
posted a 1.460 OPS in her senior 
campaign.
“I’m seeing the ball pretty 
well,” Sobczak said. “My mindset 
going into the box is ‘Try not to 
suck and hit the ball really hard,’ 
and it’s really working out. It’s 
about having the approach that 

it’s a new at-bat and really trying 
to hit it hard and be locked in. 
My hard work has been paying 
off.”
While Sobczak and the rest 
of Michigan’s offense continued 
to make good contact, Beaubien 
consistently 
stymied 
Rutgers 
in the circle. She picked up 
her 12th and 13th wins of the 
season during the series, but 
her scoreless inning streak was 
snapped at 32.1 consecutive 
frames when Scarlet Knights 
shortstop 
Jess 
Hughes 
launched a one-
out home run in 
the third inning 
of Friday’s game.
Beaubien’s 
response to the 
end of her streak? 
She brushed off 
the 
long 
ball 
by striking out 
the next batter 
before inducing a shallow pop fly 
to end the frame.
During the series, Beaubien 
pitched more than 12 of the 
19 total innings — a workload 
consistent with the rest of 2019. 
Despite the fact that Beaubien 
has hurled more than half of 

Michigan’s innings this season, 
Hutchins has no qualms about 
the ace’s longevity.
“(Beaubien) is as durable a 
pitcher as I’ve ever had on my 
staff,” Hutchins said. “Credit 
to her. She does everything you 
need to do because taking care of 
yourself is important. Whether 
it’s cold-tubbing or going to 
see the trainer, she does it all. 
She keeps herself fit — kudos to 
her because she is as durable a 
pitcher as there is in the NCAA.”
After 
leaving 
Piscataway 
with their sixth Big Ten win in 
as many tries, the Wolverines 
join No. 19 Minnesota and 
Northwestern as the last Big Ten 
teams with a perfect conference 
record through two weekends. 
Michigan — which has outscored 
opponents 96-10 during this 
11-game streak — is the hottest of 
the group.
Entering 
the 
weekend, 
Hutchins knew her team would 
have to play quality softball 
against a Rutgers team hungry to 
defeat the Wolverines. Twenty-
four runs, 34 hits and three 
wins later, the zero in Hutchins’ 
loss column against the Scarlet 
Knights remains intact.
18 tries, 18 victories.

This 
weekend, 
it 
didn’t 
matter who was on first for 
Rutgers — Lexie Blair had 
stolen second anyway.
Highlighting 
her 
killer 
weekend in Saturday’s 7-0 
victory against the Scarlet 
Knights, 
the 
freshman 
outfielder showed her speed 
in a sprint to second base and 
then third due to a throwing 
error. The run moved senior 
second 
baseman 
Faith 
Canfield to home plate in a 
play that could have kept Blair 
on first.
With 
her 
steal, 
Blair 
created the run that gave 
Michigan 
that 
lead 
early, 
and 
her 
=contributions 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
dominant 
series 
didn’t 
stop 
at 
that 
run. Blair led 
the 
Michigan 
offense 
all 
weekend, 
a 
common 
trend 
for 
the 
freshman.
“Scoring 
those runs early 
on in the inning 
really sets the 
tone and sets great energy for 
the entire game,” Blair said. 
“That’s a big deal.”
Blair 
emerged 
as 
an 
offensive presence early in 
the season, and that role 
hasn’t diminished as Michigan 
returned home for conference 
play. In fact, Big Ten play 
against Nebraska last weekend 
and now Rutgers has only 
solidified 
her 
leadership 
offensively: Blair leads the 
team with a batting average of 
.407 and 44 hits, trailing only 
Canfield in runs.
To start the weekend, Blair 
hit both a double and a home 
run to bring other runners 
home 
— 
the 
extra-base 
hits aside from senior first 
baseman Alex Sobczak’s blast 
to start the game. In addition 
to that figure, Blair scored two 

runs and drove in two runs in 
Saturday morning’s game and 
scored eight runs with four 
RBI on the weekend.
And her performance this 
weekend wasn’t an anomaly. 
For the past three weekends 
since the Wolverines began 
home play, Blair has anchored 
the offense with consistent 
and timely hits in almost 
every at-bat. That productivity 
has been vital for Michigan, 
having started the season 
12-10 on the road, a lower win 
percentage than in previous 
years.
“When she’s up there, you 
can always count on her. She 
doesn’t care what the count is, 
she puts a good bat on the ball 
regardless of whether there’s 
no strikes or two strikes,” 
said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. 
“She’s 
a 
fearless hitter 
who’s 
not 
afraid to get 
behind, 
and 
she’s been very 
important 
to 
us.”
However, 
maintaining 
power hitting 
hasn’t 
always 
been 
as 
fluid 
for 
Blair, 
especially 
considering 
her 
inexperience at the collegiate 
level. 
While 
Blair 
started 
the season with nerves at 
the plate, her strong start to 
the season has calmed those 
nerves slightly.
“Because 
it’s 
a 
road 
game, you can get tired and 
jetlagged, but the coaches 
stayed on top of us and kept us 
in our system. We were good 
to go as if we were playing at 
home,” Blair said. “I felt great. 
I felt calm, relaxed and not 
getting too much in my head. 
Our intensity and energy level 
was good the whole weekend.”
Regardless of jitters, Lexie 
Blair delivered another big 
weekend at the plate. And that 
just might be the new normal 
for the Wolverines.

“The reason why we’re here is because of you”: For Matthews, an end

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Charles 
Matthews stood at the line and 
made the free-throw motion. He 
buried his head in his shirt for 
a second. Missed the first free 
throw. Bent his knees, stayed in 
that position for an extra beat as 
his teammates subbed out. Sunk 
the second free throw.
Then, he made his exit.
Matthews didn’t even see 
the crowd rise to its feet, 
applauding the captain who 
had done so much 
for the Michigan 
basketball 
program. He kept 
his head down.
“I know it was 
over 
with,” 
he 
said.
He was talking 
about the game, 
a 63-44 thud of 
a loss to Texas 
Tech that ended 
an otherwise successful 30-7 
season. But there was an even 
bigger sense of finality to it.
Matthews 
says 
he 
hasn’t 
thought 
about 
the 
looming 
NBA decision yet. So do his 
teammates. They don’t fully 
admit what most around the 
program 
have 
known 
for 
months, but as Matthews sat 
on the bench for the rest of the 
game, crying into a towel on the 
sideline, it felt like the end in so 
many more ways than one.
Assistant 
coach 
DeAndre 
Haynes said, “He had a hell 
of 
a 
career.” 
According 
to 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers, “He said it was his last 
year.” 
And 
Michigan 
coach 
John Beilein admitted himself 
after the game, “Charles will 
graduate, so we expect him to 
go pro.”
This was it for him, and 
everybody knew it, even when 
it wasn’t said. But even as his 
career flashed before his eyes, 
Matthews did everything he 

could to fight for what remained.
At 
halftime, 
when 
the 
Wolverines left the floor with 
just 16 points, Matthews saw 
the 
frustration 
instantly. 
It 
was all over his face, too. He 
offered his own brand of stern 
encouragement.
“Just don’t quit,” he said. 
“Whatever you do, just don’t 
quit.”
As the game slipped further 
and further away, he did the 
same.
“The way he was coming to 
the huddle,” Haynes said. “Just 
getting up in 
everybody, 
say, ‘We gotta 
continue 
to 
fight. There’s a 
lot of time left 
on the clock.’ ”
In the second 
half, 
even 
as 
his 
team 
wilted 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
Red 
Raiders’ 
defense, 
Matthews 
kept fighting. When he couldn’t 
get anything from the field 
either, he found his way to the 
line, where he made 6-of-8 free 
throws. He scored 12 points 
— eight in the second half — 
grabbed four boards and kept 
Texas Tech wing Jarrett Culver 
under 50 percent shooting.
And 
afterwards, 
he 
took 
responsibility, 
refusing 
to 
answer whether the Red Raiders 
were 
the 
best 
defense his team 
had seen. All he 
said 
was 
that 
Michigan didn’t 
make shots.
Really, it was 
just an extension 
of 
the 
person 
Matthews 
has 
been 
all 
year. 
He used to be 
the 
quiet 
guy, 
but as a captain this season, he 
found his voice. At the rough 
practices, the ones where no 

one wanted to be there and they 
showed it, Matthews’ was the 
voice 
everyone 
heard, 
telling 
others to speak 
up, telling them 
that they could 
make the shot, 
telling 
them 
to keep going, 
telling them to 
be accountable.
“It’s 
just 
a 
major 
thing 
when a guy gives 
his all,” Livers said. “ … He was 
just a very good captain, man. 
He had a handle on us the whole 

season.”
This 
wasn’t 
supposed 
to 
be the way his 
career 
ended, 
not after coming 
back at the last 
minute when he 
tested the NBA 
draft 
waters 
last spring. Not 
when 
he 
was 
clear from the 
beginning 
that 
he was there to 
win a national 
championship. 
Not 
when 
everyone knew that he would 
soon leave for bigger and better 

things.
But the whole thing was 
bittersweet, 
because 
really, 
Matthews made 
the team in his 
image — tough, 
defense-minded, 
competitive 
until 
the 
very 
end. 
Without 
that, 
maybe 
the 
Wolverines 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
in 
the 
Sweet Sixteen in the first place.
“It wasn’t always pretty,” 
Matthews said. “But we found a 

way. Plenty of times we got some 
wins that was questionable. And 
this team always found a way to 
make it up.”
That’s Charles Matthews: not 
always pretty, but he found a 
way.
After 
the 
final 
buzzer, 
Matthews 
left 
the 
floor, 
walking through the tunnel 
with sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole’s arm draped around him 
and a towel over his head. When 
he got into the locker room, 
Haynes had a message.
“You don’t need to put your 
head down. The reason why 
we’re here is because of you.”

Redshirt junior wing Charles Matthews played perhaps his final collegiate game Thursday, scoring 12 points in Michigan’s 63-44 loss to Texas Tech.

Charles will
