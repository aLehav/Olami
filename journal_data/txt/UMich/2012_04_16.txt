Rain-shortened
fundraiser hauls
in record amount
By PETER SHAHIN
DailyStaffReporter
Though there wasn't a car-
nival this weekend at Palmer
Field, it certainly looked that
way.
For 24 hours, the Universi-

ty's annual Relay for Life event
united thousands of students,
faculty and staff for the com-
mon cause of defeating can-
cer. This year's Relay funding
surpassed last year's record
of $340,000 with more than
$365,217 raised by Sunday's
10 a.m. conclusion ceremony.
This year's total is expected to
increase further because the
collection of money was dis-
rupted due to thunderstorms
at 5 a.m. yesterday.

Relay for Life strives to
fund cancer research and sup-
port services that the Ameri-
can Cancer Society oversees.
Relays are the main fundrais-
ing vehicle for the ACS, and it
is estimated that more than 4
million Americans have taken
part in Relay events since its
inception in 1986. According to
the Relay website, more than
$3 billion has been raised for
the ACS since that time.
After the event, LSA senior

Laura Flusty, co-executive
director of Relay for Life,
wrote in a statement to The
Michigan Daily that despite
the disruption in fundraising
collection, the organizers still
considered the event a success.
"Though the weather was
not ideal towards the end, we
still were able to make the most
out of the event with a large
attendance, and even larger
fundraising total," Flusty

STUDENT START-UPS
* TechArb honors work
at end-of-year event


Showcase
highlights student
entrepreneurship
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
In a cavernous room with
dusty floors and exposed light
fixtures on East Liberty Street,
members of Ann Arbor's start-
up community gathered on
Friday to celebrate their busi-
ness successes.
At the TechArb spring
showcase, about 150 people
came together for a variety of
startup and entrepreneurship
related affairs in honor of the

University's startup incubator.
Some came to showcase their
companies and ideas to inves-
tors, fans and peers, and grad-
uating seniors were applauded
for receiving the Program of
Entrepreneurship certificate
on their diplomas. TechArb
also announced its next round
of members for the second half
of 2012.
Engineering Dean David
Munson said the University
and Ann Arbor are becom-
ing entrepreneurial hubs that
might one day rival those of the
Silicon Valley and New York.
He referred to Ann Arbor as
"this nation's next great entre-
preneurial ecosystem and cre-
ative community."

Munson also reiterated the
need for entrepreneurial Uni-
versity graduates to stay con-
nected with the campus even
after leaving Ann Arbor. He
said alumni should keep in
touch with their classmates
and remain aware of startup
news.
Doug Neal, executive direc-
tor of the Center for Entrepre-
neurship, praised graduating
seniors who have completed
the Program in Entrepreneur-
ship - a nine-credit program
that teaches entrepreneurial
skills. Neal said the program
is available to 90 percent of
undergraduates at the Univer-
sity.

Nobel Peace Prize recipient
Martin Luther King Jr., one of
his visits to the University dur-

January that feature King giv-

U Pittsburgh faces bomb threats

The University of Pittsburgh
has received 92 bomb threats this
semester. The series of threats
began in mid-February, The Pitt
News reported on Saturday.
According to a Pitt News
article published Thursday, the
majority of the threats were tar-
geted toward residence halls and
University-owned apartments,
causing frequent evacuations
from campus buildings.
The Pitt News also reported
Thursday that the University of
Pittsburgh Police Department
arrested Mark Lee Krangle, who
had allegedly sent threatening
e-mails to four professors at Pitt
and also posted messages on his
Facebook in which he acknowl-

edged communication wit
purveyors of the threats.

Making matters worse, an

recovering well after a hip
replacement but would not be
able to resume full duties for
more than a month.
His son, 44-year-old Prince

government relies on to patch
up diplomatic disputes, boost
international trade and serve as
" the country's high-profile liai-

TUITION
From Page 1A
tuition equality plan has not been
adopted is because of its highly
controversial nature.
"They're really putting them-
selves out on the line with these
issues," Mersol-Barg said. "Right
now, I'm not sure that they're
willing to put out the political
capital to make sure that they
can litigate this issue if someone
opposes it."
Another challenge in imple-
menting the policy would be the
inevitable increase of competi-
tion for in-state admissions, Mer-
sol-Barg said.
He added that though the
University is constitutionally
autonomous, the Michigan state
legislature could potentially cut
funding if it disagrees with a poli-
cy that the regents adopt.
He also noted that a preview
of the Provost's report led him
to believe the outlook of the
situation is not in his organiza-
tion's favor. However, he said he
believes the regents should fight
any political pressure they expe-
rience in order to implement a
tuition equality plan.
According to Laura Sanders,
a lecturer in the School of Social
Work and the co-founder of the
Washtenaw Interfaith Coali-
tion for Immigrant Right - an
organization which aids families
affected by deportation and immi-
gration raids and detainments -
there are 65,000 undocumented
students estimated to be enrolled
in colleges around the country.
Mersol-Barg explained that it's
very hard to determine the num-
ber of undocumented students
currently enrolled at the Univer-
sity because undocumented stu-
dents are not often comfortable
with revealing their citizenship

status.
He predicted that even with
a newly established policy, the
increase in undocumented stu-
dents at the University would
likely be minimalsince itwill still
be challenging for them to pay for
schoolwithout financial aid.
"(There is a) very entrenched
perception within the undocu-
mented community that higher
education isn't for them because
it is so difficult to pay for." Mer-
sol-Barg said. "Even if we pass
this policy we're still going to
have to supplement it with finan-
cial aid or other ways to make it
financially feasible for the major-
ity of students."
Sanders said she views offer-
ing undocumented residents in-
state tuition as an issue of human
rights, adding that it would be in
the University's best interest since
it could attract talented students.
She added most undocument-
ed families do pay taxes, using a
PIN number in place of a Social
Security number. Due to this,
Sanders said she believes they
should have access to the same
benefits as other taxpayers.
"They're not able to reap some
of the benefits like emergency
housing help (or) disability," she
said. "(Federal) financial aid is a
really good example."
Under current policy, undocu-
mented applicants are considered
international students due to
their inability to provide a Social
Security number. Since the Uni-
versity's Office of Admissions is
separate from the Office of the
Registrar - which deals with
enrollment and fees - undocu-
mented students can be admitted
into the University, but are unable
to claimresidencywiththe Office
of the Registrar.
Should the University adopt a
tuition equality plan, it is unclear
how undocumented students

could claim residency on the
application. Mersol-Barg said
there are several approaches the
University could take, depend-
ing on how overt they plan to be
about the integration.
"I think there are two ways to
go about it," Mersol-Barg said.
"One is explicitly extending in-
state tuition to undocumented
students. Or (the other is) kind
of casting a wider net through
providing particular criteria ...
like demonstrating that they've
attended high school for three
years or earned a high school
diploma or GED (from a Michi-
gan school)."
The University's Office of Pub-
lic Affairs declined to set up an
interview with Martha Pollack,
the University's vice provost for
academic and budgetary affairs.
LSA senior Alexis Smith, an
in-state student, said she believes
the increased competition would
be beneficial for the University.
"I can see how it would look
like it would be a disadvantage for
in-state students because we're
actually from here, so we should
feel like we're actually guar-
anteed those spots, but in this
situation I feel like since they're
already disadvantaged enough ...
it's a little even that way," Smith.
LSA freshman Edward Cali-
han, an out-of-state student,
said while he believes it's impor-
tant that individuals have equal
access to higher education, he
would be frustrated that they
would be offered in-state rates
when out-of-state students who
are residents would have to pay
much more than them.
"I don't mean to sound bitter,
but paying out-of-state tuition
makes me feel like it's unfair -
I'm mad that in-state kids pay
what they do to begin with, let
alone unregistered individuals."
Calihan said.

RELAY FOR LIFE
From Page 1A
wrote. "I am truly impressed
by the passion and enthusiasm
that students from all over cam-
pus showed on Palmer Field."
Public Policy junior Sam
Lewis, co-executive director
of the University's Relay for
Life, said the organization reg-
istered 2,599 participants for
this year's Relay, but hundreds,
if not thousands, of people vis-
ited Palmer Field throughout
the course of the day to support
the cause.
One of the highlights of Relay
events across the nation is the
Luminaria Ceremony, which
commemorates those who have
lost their battle with cancer.
At about 9 p.m., luminaries lit
the way for runners circling
the track and student speakers
shared personal stories to the.
crowd gathered in the middle of
Palmer Field.
LSA junior Holly Hein, a
Michigan soccer player cur-
rently battling thyroid cancer,
told the crowd that the most
important part of her fight with
cancer has been the support
she's received from her team-
mates and family. Hein was not
able to play last year because of
her treatment.
"They didn't know (I had
cancer) at the time, but they
were my rock, and just being
able to be with them and to play
meant everything to me," Hein
said. "I don't know howI would
react if one of my teammates
told me they had cancer, but
(when I told them) they were
so caring and concerned and
compassionate ... it was unbe-

At the end of the ceremony,
musical performances by stu-
dents provided participants
with time to reflect on their own
experiences with cancer and
remember fallen loved ones. The
Luminaria Ceremony conclud-
ed with a silent lap around the
track by all participants.
For the remaining 23 hours,
Relayhosted performances from
numerous student groups -
from a cappella singing to Scot-
tish dancing - food from local
sponsors and even massages.
Additionally, there was a
"Survivor Ceremony" to honor
those that have beaten cancer
and a brief closing ceremony
at 10 a.m. yesterday, where the
organizers announced the fund-
raising total.
Though unified for one cause,
Relay brought together a vari-
ety of typically unrelated stu-
dent organizations. LSA junior
Sara Haynes, a member of the
University's Pre-Med Club, said
many of the group's partici-
pants were eager to take part in
an event that would be relevant
to their future careers.
"As future doctors, we
wanted to take part, give back
and help support the cause,"
Haynes said.
The Pre-Med Club raised
$2,000 before Saturday and
sold bracelets at the event, in
which buyers accrued a bead
for each lap taken on the track,
to help raise additional money
for ACS.
Individually, Phi Gamma
Delta raised the most of any
organization with about
$43,000, followed closely by the
Chi Omega/Psi Upsilon team
with $42,000.

Enact tuition equality
Charge in-state rates for undocumented immigrants
As the cost of obtaining a college degree increases each year,
higher education becomes a less realistic goal for those from
lower income families or families hesitant to accumulate
debt. As a result, diversity at the University continues to exist increas-
ingly only in rhetoric. While many steps must be taken to attract
and retain students from all walks of life, the University is currently
examining whether to charge in-state tuition rates to undocumented
immigrants residing in Michigan. Charging the out-of-state tuition
for undocumented Michigan public school graduates hinders stu-
dents who worked hard to be accepted to the University. The Univer-
sity's Board of Regents should make this issue a priority and enforce
tuition equality to increase student diversity and maintain focus on

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR I
The Daily's 'Order' dilemma

education, not politics.
At the request of Regent Julia Darlow
(D-Ann Arbor), Provost Philip Hanlon is
assembling a report on tuition equality for
undocumented students for the board's con-
sideration. Members of the Coalition for
Tuition Equality, a student-led alliance aim-
ing to bring students and student organiza-
tions together in support of tuition equality,
have spoken at the regents' monthly meet-
ings about the circumstances undocumented
students face at the University. The group
hopes the University will change its policy
and allow undocumented immigrants who
have graduated from Michigan high schools
to pay in-state tuition.
The University should enact this change to
open doors for a more racially and socio-eco-
nomically diverse student body. The Univer-
sity prides itself on its diversity - experience
with diversity is raised as early the admis-
sions application - but as demonstrated by
recent incoming freshman classes, the Uni-
versity can be doing much more, especially
in terms of socio-economic diversity. Recent
reports have shown that 79 percent of college
enrolled students are in the highest income
bracket, but only 34 percent are in the low-
est. Lowering tuition would allow for more
high-achieving undocumented immigrants
to enroll in the University, and increase rep-

resentation for a large but often ignored sec-
tor of the population.
Since CTE's founding this year by Public
Policy junior Kevin Mersol-Barg, the orga-
nization has made impressive progress, as
evidence by Hanlon's upcoming report. CTE
has successfully brought a wide array of stu-
dent organizations into the conversation on
tuition equality. It's apparent there is campus
support for a policy change, and it's not dif-
ficult to understand why. Many undocument-
ed immigrants came to the U.S. by no fault
of their own and face daily difficulties due
to their immigration status. Barring those
students from a more affordable education
increases their hardship. Other Michigan
universities, including Western Michigan
University and Wayne State University, have
policies that allow undocumented immi-
grants to pay in-state rates. The University is
in a clear position to be an advocate for edu-
cation.
Congress hasn't passed the Development,
Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act,
which would grant citizenship to undocu-
mented minors after living in the country
for five years, since its introduction in 2001.
Because of this lack of federal action, the Uni-
versity is obligated to support education and
student diversity by enacting tuition equality.

The fallout from last week's
Statement cover story -
"Order and chaos: Explor-
ing the controversy surrounding a
not-so-secret society" - was quite
extraordinary for one reason: The
most outspoken critics and defend-
ers of the story are really pretty
much the same people: Current or
recently-departed editors of The
Michigan Daily. This uniquely
staffed controversy brought up
two important issues that I want to
address.
First is the membership of Daily
staffers inthe studentgroup known
as Order of Angell. This controver-
sy has confirmed my belief that it is
inappropriate for editors who com-
prise the Daily's leadership core to
be affiliated with Order. I say this
with no ill intent toward Order.
Admittedly, I'm no expert on that
group. I come to this conclusion
solely based on the question of
what is best for the Daily.
I understand that there is a long
tradition of Daily editors being
involved with Order (and its prede-
cessor, Michigamua). I also recog-
nize that Order does some positive
things on campus, and that mem-
bership of a Daily editor in the
group could have some potential
benefit. All that said, I believe that
the drawbacks of a Daily editor
being involved in that group out-
weigh the benefits.
This opinion is informed by per-
sonal experience of several recent
debates at this paper about order
membership - though I concede
that many editors have joined with-
out controversy. It's also informed
by my knowledge of how this paper
works, what its needs are, and what
ultimately are the journalistic and
practical life lessons students are
supposed to learn at the Daily.
The mere fact that joining Order
is a contentious issue that causes
immense friction among the Dai-
ly's staff is reason enough to avoid
it. This is not to say that editors
don't have the right to join, but just
that they should show good judg-
ment about their responsibilities as
leaders at the Daily and walk away
from this unnecessary controversy.
Just as importantly, consider
why the Daily forbids its staffers
from being involved in student gov-
ernment: The perceived conflict of
loyalties is too much to explain.
The primary responsibility and
allegiance of Daily editors should

be to this newspaper and student
government membership seems to
undermine that ideal.
Similarly, while I believe it is
possible to be in Order and judi-
ciously serve as a fair editor at this
newspaper - and I take issue with
any implication that recent editors
who were members of the group
committed breaches of journalistic
ethics I think that it is simply too
fine of a line to constantly walk. And
even when walked appropriately,
it causes editors to preclude them-
selves from editing or writing cer-
tain stories - which is a deviation
from their job responsibilities, and
causes more work for their peers.
After all, we have a choice, and we
should walk away from that line.
Moving on to the second issue:
The allegation that the story in
question was ill-intentioned, and
committed some breaches of jour-
nalistic ethics itself. It has been
alleged that some sources were mis-
led about the content of the story,
and that the story selectively picked
from the information provided by
sources to unfairly advocate an
agenda. It is impossible for me to
decide the truth of this issue: I have
been told exactly opposite things by
people I have no reason to distrust.
I will stick, then, to the bits that I
can objectively comment upon.
First, the mere fact that editors
who oversaw a story might have
personal iews on-anissue does not
constitute a confict of interest, and
allegations along those lines are
unfair. Second, it is routine prac-
tice for many sources to be inter-
viewed, and for only a few of them
to be quoted. I am told that cumu-
lative sources were paraphrased in
this story, and I see nothing wrong
with that. However, selective rep-
resentation of viewpoints, under
guise of telling the whole story, is
never acceptable. I encourage writ-
ers and editors to be especially cog-
nizant of that issue.
No one denies that sources were
contacted at the last minute - via
e-mail and Google Chat, no less.
And yet, I was repeatedly told that
this story was in planning and pro-
duction for many months. So, there
is a problem here.
The Daily has a policy of strong-
ly favoring in-person or phone
interviews over e-mail (or modes
even more fluid, such as instant
messaging). This policy has been
taken too lightly recently, and I

think this story provides a good
lesson on why it must once again
be strongly emphasized.
Yes, it is harder to get com-
ments from people in person or on
the phone, but that is precisely the
point: Our focus asjournalists is not
to do things the easy way,but rather
to embrace the hard way if that is
called for. The reason to avoid fall-
ing back on methods like e-mail is
made clear in this story: There is an
incentive to wait till the last min-
ute, to ask for "just a quick quote"
as opposed to actually having a con-
versation and getting full informa-
tion. My point here should not be
contested: Some of the very people
who settled for e-mail comments
in the Statement story asked me to
contact them by phone as opposed
to simply responding to my e-mail.
Finally, given the subject of this
story, andtheimmense disturbance
it caused within this newspaper, I
question what went into the deci-
sion to do this story at all. The Dai-
ly's bylaws state that "Management
Desk will have final authority over
all matters concerning the edito-
rial side of The Michigan Daily."
In practice, this has been taken to
mean that controversial stories are
run by M-Desk, especially stories
that comment on the internal deal-
ings of the Daily.
It would have been beneficial,
and arguably was required by the
Daily' bylaws, to have run the
Statement story in -question by
M-Desk - something that was not
done. When faced with the deci-
sion about whether to run this
story, M-Desk would have closely
questioned its purpose, gauged its
repercussions and then decided
whether it was worth the trouble.
Regardless of who made the deci-
sion, part of the consideration should
be how the story reflects on the pub-
lic image of this newspaper. As the
fallout from the story has shown,
coverage in this paper of order has
become more about the Daily than
about Order. There has to be a seri-
ous discussion about how healthy
that is for the Daily as an institution.

The end result

When I started looking at colleges, which seems like
a million years ago now, my parents stressed the impor-
tance of the "college experience." While it was obvi-
ously importantto get a good education, they reminded
me that the next four years of my life would involve a
lot of learning and experiences that took place outside
the classroom. And when I left for school, they told me
again in fear that I would bury my nose in my books,
never to be seen again.
It turned out to not be a problem for me - I didn't
let striving to get good grades get in the way of clubs I
wanted to join, dinners I wanted to go to, or friends I
wanted to make. I certainly didn't let a little thing like
class stop me from going to the Sugar Bowl. And as a
result, I think I had a pretty great college experience
while maintaining a high standard of work. I don't look
back on my time here and wish I had done X, Y and Z
instead. (Though I do regret never sledding in the Arb
- who knew we wouldn't get snow this winter?)
As I move forward from this period, though, that
seems to have changed. Not by any means from my
parents, who think it's important to enjoy your life, but
from others. The same people who stress the impor-
tance of the "college experience" are now telling me
to look toward the end goal as I consider different
law schools. Suddenly all that matters is what school
has the most internships, what school has the highest
placement record and what school is ranked highest on
reviews. No one has asked me where I think I'm going
to be happy.
It sounds stupid even when I say it. I mean, ask any-
one. You don't go to law school to be happy, you go to
become a lawyer. And that is absolutely true. (Serious-

everyone else on the planet, which is not totally out of
the realm of possibility, I don't do very good work when
I'm miserable.
Of course, I'm picking a law school based on employ-
ment prospects, school reputation and specialization in
my field of interest. But I'm also going to pick a school
where I am going to get along with the other students,
like the area around me and feel like I belong. Honestly,
if I'm unhappy at my school, I'm hardly goingto do well
enough to place in the rankings, even if I'm at the best
law school I could get into.
It sounds really simple when put like that, but I think
it's a concept that too many people around me are for-
getting, both with regard to my life and to theirs. There
is more to life than grades; there is more to life than
going to the best school in the country. If I don't take
time outside of law school to do things that make me
happy, whether it's going out with friends, going to the
zoo or traveling to Michigan football games, what am
I going to have when there is no more law school? If I
make myself solely one thing, I'm not going to be very

out taking into account all the things that are going to
happen along the way, my <em>life</em> isn't going to
be very interesting either. I know where I want to be in

get there. But I'm going to have some fun along the way.

TV/NEW MEDIA COLUMN
'Girls' may miss
opportunity to
show diversity

F iLM REVEW V
'Cabin' hosts satire genius

s we come to the close
of the regular television
season, it's time to start
hunting for the buried treasures
of summer programming. It's
true that sum-
mer shows
used to - and
can often still
be - mostly
mindless filler
with a few
gems sprin-
kled here and KAYLA
there. This UPADHYAYA
week, HBO
launched its
new dramedy "Girls," a show I'm
simultaneously excited for and
concerned about.
Let's start with the good.
"Girls," created and written by
its star Lena Dunham, follows
four young women in their early
20s as theylive, learn and love in
New York City. Their ringleader
is Hannah, an aspiring memoir-
ist who is awkward, intense and
ambitious.
As Emily Nussbaum of The
New Yorker puts it, "Girls" is like
* nothing else currently on televi-
sion. It's a sex comedy from the
perspective of female characters,
a show that prioritizes women's
sexual agency and healthy female
friendships. It's everything I've
ever wanted from television!
Well, not quite. I'm worried
about "Girls" because - despite
all that it undertakes - it's still
exclusive. In a show set in one
of the most racially and cultur-
ally diverse cities in the country,
there isn't a single woman of
color in the core group of friends.
These girls attended fancy liberal
arts schools, and even though
their parents have cut them off
financially as a way to push them
forward, they come from the
upper class.
I'm concerned that "Girls" is
going to relegate characters of
color to background roles that
pop up intermittently in the lives
of these privileged white women.
When shows do this, these char-
acters are rarely fully developed
or nuanced, usually based on ste-
reotypes and assumptions. The
promos don't give me much hope:
The only woman of color who
appears is a gynecologist with
some words of wisdom. I hope
"Girls" will be smart enough not
to throw in a sassy black friend
or a sexually promiscuous Latina
or an uptight Asian girl as filler
or tokens that scream "hey, look,
diversity!"
On the subject of tokenism, by
no means do I wish that Dunham
had written one of these main
characters as a woman of color
just to have a woman of color.
White writers creating minor-
ity characters can sometimes be
problematic, as they don't possess
the lived experience of persons
of color. Again, there's the risk of
stereotyping. The answer lies not
only with diversifying a cast, but
also with diversifying the writ-
ers' room. To write characters
with diverse experiences and
backgrounds, there need to be
writers with diverse experiences
and backgrounds contributing.
As for the show's lack of socio-
economic diversity, Nussbaum
claims that the show takes the
specific demographic these girls
belong to and then "mines their
lives for the universal," but again,

I'm skeptical. I'm willing to give
the show the benefit of the doubt,
and I don't want to criticize it
too much before giving it a real
chance, but being cut off from
mom and dad's payroll is hardly
the same as coming from a low-
income household. Yes, I sympa-
thize with Hannah's inability to
find a paying job in the big city,
especially since I'm likely to face
a similar future, but what about

girls who couldn't go to college
or don't have the ability to move
home if they fail or were raised
by single mothers? New York City
is home to many women and men
alike who fit this description,
but they appear to be completely
absent from "Girls."
Some writers have noted that
"Girls" looks like ayounger, hip-
ster-fied "Sex and the City," and
I disagree to an extent. Whereas
"Sex and the City" romanticized
New York living and often pre-
sented its four main characters
as lovesick idealists (as Miranda
puts it in the season two pre-
miere: "How does it happen that
four such smart women have
nothingto talk about but boy-
friends?"), "Girls" takes a more
realistic and gritty route. The
lives these girls live, the sex they
have - none of it is all glamour
all the time.
Characters on
screen reflect a
one-dimensional
writers' room.
But when critic Willa Paskin
remarks that "Girls" is "for us,
by us," I can't completely accept
it. She herself calls the show's
lack of minority representation a
bad mistake in her review of the
first three episodes, so is it really
appropriate to use a universal
"us" to describe the show's make-
up and target audience?
I think that sometimes femi-
nist film and TV critics can get
wrapped up in the excitement of
simply having a show or movie
that places women at the fore-
front without mistreating, limit-
ing or devaluing them, because
it's unfortunately something
that is still a rarity in main-
stream pop culture. But this
excitement can lead to a lack of
criticism.
This happened with "Brides-
maids," which people have been
quick to compare with "Girls,"
mainly due to the Judd Apatow
producer credit they share. Ad
campaigns and critics alike made
it seem like if all women didn't
immediately go see "Brides-
maids," there would never be
another movie for and about
women ever again. In many ways,
it's true that the movie represents
an achievement, but it's hardly
the be-all, end-all, Hollywood-
hearts-feminism savior. And I
feel similarly about "Girls." We
can applaud it for its commend-
able successes, but we should also
critique it for the ways in which it
doesn't quite satisfy.
If "Girls" is supposed to be
the voice of a generation - or a
defense and critique of a genera-
tion, as Nussbaum calls it - it's
certainly painting a very narrow
picture of whatthat generation is:
white, liberal, educated. Its title
alone evokes a sense of represen-
tation, but that representation
is incomplete. In a time when
"Two and a Half Men" creator
Lee Aronsohn derides female-
centric television by saying
"we're approaching peak vagina
on television, the point of labia
saturation," I can't emphasize

enough just how important it is
that "Girls" and other female-
POV shows take a stand against
the Man. But in excluding a more
diverse range of women, the girls
of "Girls" can't possibly speak to
us all, and I hope it doesn't pre-
tend to.

Mock-horror offers
new take on typical
genre scares
By ARIELLE ACKERMAN
Daily Arts Writer
Nowadays, there's a certain
stigma of unoriginality attached
to horror films. Every film fol-
lows the same
formulaic sto- gg *
ryline: At least
five teenagers The Cabin in
or college stu-
dents travel
somewhere for At Quality16
a nice week- and Rave
end getaway
that soon takes Lionsgate
a turn for the
worse. Filled to the brim with
nudity and excessive gore, these
films, fittingly dubbed "torture
porn," are made almost exclu-
sively for shock value. Horror
films stopped trying to scare
viewers both physically and psy-
chologically - that is, until "The
Cabin in the Woods."
Just as the formula goes, five
collegestudents set out for a vaca-
tion to, you guessed it, a cabin in
the woods. They're expecting
a weekend full of beer, tanning
and fun, but their expectations
soon unravel when some ter-
rible, horror-film villains attack.
Meanwhile, some men in suits in
a high-security facility are eerily
linked to these college kids. To
give any more away would be to
betray the film's entire plot.
The acting is what you'd
expect from a horror film, which

"Where's the open bar?"
is, of course, exactly the point.
Some surprisingly humorous
and memorable performances
stem from the stereotypical
stoner (Fran Kanz, "Diary of
a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules")
and one of the men in suits
(Bradley Whitford, TV's "The
West Wing").
Everything, from the title to
the creepy guy at the gas sta-
tion who alludes to the cabin's
ominous reputation, so aptly
represents all the stereotypes
expected of modern-day hor-
ror films. Joss Whedon ("Buffy
the Vampire Slayer") and Drew
Goddard ("Cloverfield"), who co-
wrote the film, cleverly call out
every horror film that has come
before it just for such stereotypes.
They make the film breathtak-

ingly original precisely because
they use every unoriginal scary
device in the book, taking cliches
from zombie films to Japanese
ghost tales and turning them on
their heads. Their inspired writ-
ing also makes "The Cabin in the
Woods" perhaps one of the fun-
niest horror films ever.
Not only does the film bril-
liantly satirize the horror genre,
but it also calls out audiences for
taking pleasure in the sadistic
images of torture and violence
that play out before us. It makes
the viewer acutely aware that
the reason "torture porn" keeps
coming out is because we keep
going to see it. This reason alone
is what will make the film memo-
rable, as everyone who goes to
see it is sure to leave the the-

ater wondering why they are so
drawn to visual sadism.
The film's strongest attribute
is also its only downfall. The wit
and brilliance of the film detract,
only slightly, from the actual hor-
ror. Naturally, there are plenty
of blood-soaked scenes, but you
will likely find yourself chuckling
during about half of them - not
because these scenes are outright
funny, but because they so skill-
fully balance the line between
satire and subject.
"The Cabin in the Woods"
is not your typical horror film,
except that it is. It is, unmistak-
ably, every scary movie ever
rolled into one strikingly excep-
tional film, which is why anyone
who's a fan of horror will be a fan
of this.

Photo finish gives
Blue edge over OSU

'M' wins CPWA title

Michigan speeds
past four teams for
sweep in only home
event of spring
ByMATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
BELLEVILLE, Mich. - The
Michigan rowing team won the
race by the slimmest of margins,
but the day belonged to technol-
ogy.
With visibility suffering due
to a steady rain falling on Bel-
leville Lake on Saturday, it
became nearly impossibly to
tell from a distance whether
Ohio State's or Michigan's boat
crossed the finish line first in the
fourth varsity-eight race.
The regatta's referee told
bystanders that it was one of the
closest races he had ever seen.
"It's a good thing that we're
videotaping the finish lines," he
said.
Both boats waited with bait-
ed breath while the officials
reviewed the film.
After the brief delay, the Wol-
verines' time of 7:05.20 narrow-
ly edged out that of Ohio State,
7:05.34.
"The race would've been
nightmarish to call (without the
videotape)," the referee added.
Because of the photo finish,
Michigan coach Mark Rothstein
had no idea who had won. It
wasn't until he received a tweet
congratulating his fourth var-
sity-eight crew that he realized
the result.
"That was a great race," Roth-
stein said.
"It's reallynice to come out on
top of that. That crew did a real-
ly great job today. ... That was a
anod finish"

This was supposed to be the
year the streak ended. This was
the year the No. 13 Michigan
water polo team, CWPA division
champions every year since 2002,
lost its iron
grip on the NOTRE DAME 4
East Coast. MICHIGAN 20
After fin-
ishing third ICHIGAN 10

standings MICHIGAN 7
and finding
themselves down three goals to
favored No. 12 Indiana deep into
the third period of the divisional
semifinal, everyone in Blooming-
ton knew that the streak was all
but over.
Everyone, that is, except soph-
omore attacker Kelsey Nolan,
who spent most of the firsthalf on
the sideline in foul trouble.
"I was just sitting on the bench
getting all riled up," Nolan said.
Nolan, who came into the
weekend's tournament ranked
third on the roster in points, was
unstoppable once she finally got
into the pool, scoring an unheard-
of five goals in 11 minutes for the
Wolverines. Her goals came in
whatever fashion she wished
- she not only powered home a
10-meter snipe and lofted a curl-
ing lob from the corner, she was
also on the finishing end of an
alley-oop that put Michigan (4-2
CWPA, 21-11 overall) ahead for
good. When the game ended,
Michigan was on the winning side
of a 10-7 match.
The Hoosiers were stunned.
Hungry for a fourth-straight vic-
tory over its rival and a spot in the
division-title game, Indiana (5-1,
25-8) had been aggressive from
the start and controlled the game
well into the second half.
When senior Hanna Eimstad
scored to give the Hoosiers a 6-3
lead midway through the third
period, the confident hometown
fans started chanting"We are IU"

Sophomore Audrey Pratt scored a goal early on against Hartwick.

over the popular Zombie Nation
song. With star goalie Cassie
Wyckoff in net and the Wolver-
ine offense looking dysfunctional,
there was little reason for Indiana
to be worried. Michigan coach
Matt Anderson called a timeout
in one last attempt to turn things
around.
"I didn't change our game
plan," Anderson said. "It was a
matter of them understanding
that what they were doing was
embarrassingto the block'M."'
Following the timeout, Michi-
gan scored on four of its next five
possessions totake its first lead of
the game. On the defensive end,
senior goalkeeper Morgan Turn-
er was equally superb in her first
career startagainst Indiana, hold-
ing the Hoosiers scoreless for the
rest of the game except for a late
penalty shot. The comeback never
had an answer, and the Wolver-
ines comfortably played keep-
away for the last few minutes.
The win put Michigan in the
division-title game against No. 19
Hartwick (3-3, 25-11), who upset
top-seeded Maryland, 8-7, earlier

in the day. Against the Eagles, the
Wolverines also had to come back
from a late deficit.
Junior attacker Kiki Gold-
en eventually proved to be too
much for Hartwick to handle,
though, and scored four goals
in Michigan's 7-6 victory. Nolan
had another strong performance,
recording a goal and four assists.
The two connected for the game-
winning goal halfway through
the final period, when Nolan
found Golden in front of the net
for the score.
The tournament victory not
only keeps the division-title
streak alive, but it also secures an
all-important first-round bye at
the conference tournament that
will take place April 28-29. The
Wolverines will go into that tour-
nament with confidence after a
disappointing regular season. The
winnerwillget achance to playin
the national tournament in May.
Nolan was confident about
Michigan's chances.
"We're really high about this
win," she said. "We just have to
keep up the adrenaline."

In an interview after the
speech, Neal said the program is
growing rapidly.
"Things are growing across
the board," Neal said. "We have
35 startups in TechArb, 375 (stu-
dents) in the program of entre-
preneurship (and) we have 1,200
student in classes in entrepre-
neurship and 5,000, this year
alone, engaged in entrepreneur-
ship programs."
Neal noted that each TechArb
class lasts only six months in
order to inspire entrepreneurs to
work hard for a shorter period of
time. After the six months are up
they can either continue expand-
ing their idea after the program,
or learn from their mistakes and
completely re-imagine their plan.
The spring showcase marked
the end of TechArb 7 - the sev-
enth TechArb generation - and
introduced the TechArb 8 team,
which will begin in May. Most
startups that were a part of team
7 will not be a member of 8, but a
few will stay for continuity.
BASKETBALL

table projects to support youth
programs, the arts, education
and health research. In an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily,
Edwards - a former Michigan
football player and NFL wide
receiver who has previously
played for the Cleveland Browns,
New York Jets and San Francisco
49ers - said the celebrity basket-
ball game is one of his favorite
events to organize.
"We just come up with things
all the time that we do to raise
money and give back," Edwards
said. "I'm really happy my friends
came out and played and coached.
I think it was another good event."
Michigan football player Roy
Roundtree and Michigan bas-
ketball player Tim Hardaway Jr.
joined former NBA star Derrick
Coleman to coach Team Blue,
while Michigan basketball player
Jordan Morgan and Michigan
football players Denard Robinson
and Alex Swieca helped Braylon

Moses Lee, an adjunct assistant
professor at the Center for Entre-
preneurship, gave accolades to
the members of TechArb 7.
"Students have been launching
new technologies and innovations
that have really been impact-
ing communities all around the
world," Lee said.
Lee said TechArb 8 is the big-
gest class to date, noting the
class included members who had
already worked on their startups
as well as those who only had an
idea.
During the event, students pre-
sented a wide variety of ideas at
the showcase ranging from note-
taking apps to medical devices.
Business graduate student Josh
Smith - founder of YourCall.
FM, a business founded within
TechArb - said he aims to make
a website where people can create
and listen to alternative broad-
casters during a variety of sport-
ing events.
"We're bringing aspiring
broadcasters and hardcore fans to
the microphone to provide their
own innovative commentary and
post-game analysis," Smith said.
Smith said he used resources

like the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship and TechArb to start work-
ing on his idea and that he found
the community and mentorship
offered by TechArb extremely
valuable.
Engineering junior Keith
Porter, cofounder of A2B and
TechArb 7 member, said his com-
pany is working to create a bike
share program in Ann Arbor that
will be cheap and reliable. A2B
uses retail electronics to create
bikes that have GPS, Internet con-
nectivity, navigation and solar
power capabilities.
Porter said attendingthe show-
case allowed A2B to show off its
idea to the local community.
"We need to getto know every-
one we can and make sure that
everyone knows about us and that
we are the first thing that comes
to mind when they think bike
sharing," Porter said.
Neal said the showcase was
beneficial for the entrepreneurs
and the community.
"We're very big on using the
network, which is both the local
network and the alumni network,
to help take all these students to
the next level," Neal said.


Edwards coach Team Maize.
Players for Team Blue includ-
ed Michigan basketball players
Stu Douglass and Zach Novak
and former WNBA player Stacey
Lovelace-Tolbert. Detroit rapper
Trigg Da Kidd, Michigan football
player Mike Martin and Fab Five
member Jimmy King were among
the players for Team Maize.
Novak said he was happyto play
in the game and support a former
Michigan player.
"Braylon reached out to me and
to a couple other players to see if
we would just get involved and
help," Novak said. "When Braylon
Edwards tells you to come help out
at his game, you come and help."
Douglass also expressed admi-
ration for Edwards and said he
thought the event would be a fun
way to meet new people and raise
money for a worthy caxuse.
"I don't know if I'll be able to
play in this again, so it was fun to
finally experience it," Douglass
said. "Braylon's done a lot of great
things, and he's huge in the state of
Michigan and in the University of
Michigan, so it's fun to play for his

game."
Coleman, who has participated
in the event in the past, said his
favorite part of the evening was
witnessing WDIV Detroit sports-
caster Rob Parker score after con-
tinuously failing to make a basket
in previous years.
"I think last year we played at
Crisler (Center), and Rob Parker
didn't score the whole game,"
Coleman said. "I told him this
game, I said 'Look, if you don't
score, we're going to leave you in
the whole game."'
The relaxed atmosphere afford-
ed fans the opportunity to talk
with their favorite players and col-
lect autographs. Attendees were
also treated to impromptu rap
performances and concert ticket
giveaways. The Detroit Pride
Cheerleaders also greeted guests
at the doors and provided half-
time entertainment.
LSA sophomore Rebecca Barks
said the event was a great way to
spend a Friday evening and sup-
port her favorite Michigan players.
"I don't know if I'll get to see
Stu and Zach play again," she said.

at the University.
"I worked for the University
of Michigan for over 20 years -
ever since King's birthday has
been a holiday - and I've never
read of King coming to Ann
Arbor," Erdody said. "I figured
if King ever came (here), we'd
know about it in some way, and
I never remembered ever seeing
that."
After Erdody began volun-
teering at the Bentley Histori-
cal Library last year, he said he
used the Bentley's resources
and the support of the Bentley
management team to search for
the answer to his question.
"When King's birthday
approached in January, I was at
the place that could definitively
answer if he's been here or not,"
Erdody said. "And it didn't take
very much to be able to find."
Erdody said a quick search in
the Bentley's archives revealed
about 100 documents and archi-
val material relating to King.
While 99 of these results did
not relate to a University visit
by King, one result - the series
of photo negatives - sparked
Erdody's curiosity. After exam-
ining and developing the nega-
tives into photographs, Erdody
said he discovered the exact
evidence he was searching for.
"I was pretty sure that I
had something very good here
because my supervisor (Karen
Jania), was standing with me,
and she said she didn't know
anything about (the photos),
and I talked to the director of
the Bentley Library, (Francis
Blouin), and he didn't know
(about the negatives)," Erdody
said.
Searching for more infor-
mation about the photos and
King's visit to campus, Erdody
consulted former University
President James Duderstadt
after learning about his presen-
tation on student activism on
March 16 at the University.
Duderstadt, who joined the
University staff six years after
King's visit to campus, said
Erdody contacted him after
he delivered the speech and
showed him the images of King.
"All (Erdody) knew was that
they were from some event in
1962, but he didn't know what
they were," Duderstadt said.
"(Erdody) brought (the pic-
tures of King) over to me to
see if I knew some people who
had been around along enough
to figure it out, and I checked
with people ... in the Central
Administration, and they had
no knowledge of it."
Duderstadt then contacted
Public Policy junior Joseph
Lichterman, editor in chief
of The Michigan Daily, who
examined the 1962 issues of the
newspaper. Lichterman discov-
ered articles stating the date of
King's event and describing his
speech.
The material in the Daily
archives included an advertise-
ment for the event, published
on Nov. 4, 1962; an opinion
piece, printed on Nov. 8, 1962;
and two articles printed on Nov.
6, 1962 about King's speech at
Hill Auditorium - including
an event cover and an article

discussing issues surrounding
King's encouragement of civil
disobedience, which he dis-
cussed in his informal talk at
the Michigan Union.
Duderstadt explained that

tension at the University in
1962.
"There apparently was a con-
troversy because in his speech,
King suggested the importance
of civil disobedience, and I
guess a couple of the (Univer-
sity) regents raised concerns
about that," Duderstadt said. "It
was almost exactly 50 years ago,
and it was a time when Martin
Luther King was a pretty con-
troversial person. The FBI was
tracking him and so forth."
According to a 1962-1963
President's Report to the Board
of Regents, King delivered his
address twice to a "filled audi-
ence" in Hill Auditorium. The
event was organized through
the University's Office of Reli-
gious Affairs and the Michigan
Union Special Projects Com-
mittee.
Since finding the negatives,
Erdody said he and others at the
Bentley have been working to
identify the students and indi-
viduals surrounding King in the
series of photos, as well as locat-
ing the areas where he held his
discussion and attended a din-
ner at the University. Erdody
noted this has been a challeng-
ing task because of how much
time has passed since the event.
"The first thing we wanted
to do (after finding the pho-
tos) was find out as much more
about this as possible," Erdody
said. "But this was 50 years ago
to this year."
Erdody said he believes the
photos of King interacting with
attendees occurred after one
of King's two speeches in Hill
Auditorium. Duderstadt noted
the lack of diversity of the
crowd in the images.
"The composition of the
group of people that he was
talking to at Hill Auditorium
did not reflect a strong partici-
pation by people of color, which
is characteristic of the Univer-
sity at that time," Duderstadt
said. "The fact that (the event)
was in Hill Auditorium ... it
must have been an event that
attracted a significant crowd."
In the Nov. 6, 1962 issue of
the Daily where King's speech
was discussed, former Presi-
dent of the Michigan Union and
senior Robert Finke published
a viewpoint regarding the Uni-
versity's involvement with the
United States National Student
Association. According to the
Nov. 8, 1962 editorial in the
Daily, King advocated for such
involvement during his speech
at Hill Auditorium.
Finke wrote in an e-mail
interview that he does not
remember attending King's
appearance on campus, but
he assumes he attended due
to his position as President of
the Michigan Union. He added
that the University community
in the early 1960s supported
King, and he assumes King was
respected during his visit to
campus.
"Honestly, I don't recall any
specifics of the event. I recall
some events in that time frame,
but not this one. It was consis-
tent with Michigan's openness
and importance for MLK to
come and speak at the Universi-
ty," Finke wrote. "MLK was an
important figure at the time and
was regarded as such by most

in the University community, I
believe."
King's appearance at the
University was also noted in the
1963 Michiganesian Yearbook,
which included a photograph

of King speaking at Hill Audi-
torium that was not among the
negatives. University President
Mary Sue Coleman also alluded
to King's visit to the Univer-
sity in her 2008 address at Hill
Auditorium during the Martin
Luther King Jr. Symposium.
According to the Sympo-
sium's website, King was serv-
ing as the president of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference when he visited
the University for his speech.
The event on campus occurred
about nine months before the
historic March on Washington
and delivered King's "I Have a
Dream" speech. King lived for
six years after his visit to the
University before being assas-
sinated on April 4, 1968.
Finke added that he doesn't
believe the King event has been
forgotten and that it adds to
the rich history of significant
speakers at the University.
"There were many people
who came to speak in Ann
Arbor in those and later years
who were significant public fig-
ures - some more and some less
than was MLK at that time -
and I expect their appearances
have been "forgotten," too,"
Finke wrote.
For Duderstadt, King's visit
to the campus serves as an
important part of the Univer-
sity's history that should be
examined. He explained that
large public universities often
lose track of significant events
in their histories.
"It's characteristic of pub-
lic universities ... to either for-
get their history or bury it or
pave over it," Duderstadt said.
"Every once in a while, someone
who is interested in history has
to come along and dig it back up
again."
Though he discovered the
photo negatives, Erdody empha-
sized that he did not "find" the
photos, but rather his curios-
ity and interest in King led to
his discovery of the evidence of
King's visit to the University.
"This was all findable,"
Erdody said. "It wasn't any spe-
cial skill on my part; it was my
curiosity. That's what did it. I
asked the pertinent question:
'Did King come to U of M?' And
found the pertinent answer."
Erdody said the images sug-
gest a recording system may
have been used during King's
speeches, and he plans to search
for them.
"To find an audio recording
is what I really want to do,"
Erdody said. "Even though they
don't think one exists - well,
for 50 years, we didn't think
anything existed. So I'm going
to try and work magic again."
King's visit to the University
and the newfound photo evi-
dence enhance the University's
history, according to Erdody,
and he said he hopes they
become available to the campus
community.
"I think we could find out as
much as we can about (the pho-
tos) and have a permanent exhi-
bition," Erdody said. "Martin
Luther King is the single per-
son this University recognizes
the most as an individual, more
than any other person. ... Now
that we know that he's here and
the evidence is just so stunning-

ly beautiful, I'll let other (Uni-
versity) people decide what to
do with them."

Israel forbids dozens of
protesters from entering

Authorities detain
activists at airport,
claim they were a
security threat
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
detained dozens of international
activists as they landed at its main
airport yesterday, preventing
them from entering the country
to participate in a planned soli-
darity mission with Palestinians
in the West Bank.
Israel said the activists, part of
an umbrella group called "Wel-
come to Palestine," were provoca-
teurs who posed a security threat.
But organizers said the event,
meant to draw attention to Israeli
travel restrictions on Palestin-
ians, was nonviolent, and they
accused Israel of using heavy-
handed tactics to stamp outlegiti-
mate protest.
Israel is jittery about the
prospect of a large influx of

foreign protesters arriving
because of deadly confrontations
with pro-Palestinian activists in
the past. In the worst instance,
Israeli naval commandos clashed
with activists on board a flotilla
trying to break Israel's blockade
of the Gaza Strip in May 2010,
killing nine activists.
By early evening, the Interior
Ministry said a total of 49 people
had been stopped at the airport,
most on flights from France, but
alsofrom Spain, Switzerland, Can-
ada, Italy and Portugal. At least 12
were placed on flights back home,
while arrangements were being
made to expel the others.
Hundreds of police were
deployed in and around the air-
port. Police spokesman Micky
Rosenfeld said nine Israeli sym-
pathizers were questioned at
the airport after causing "public
disturbances," such as unfurl-
ing pro-Palestinian banners. No
other unrest was reported.
Asked why Israeli authorities
consider this particular group


of activists a threat, Rosenfeld
replied that they have "security
backgrounds" or were "involved
previously in different activities,"
including "security issues
concerning Israel."
He would not elaborate.
Amira Musallam, one of the
coordinators for "Welcome to
Palestine," said she was aware
of only two activists making it
through the airport. She said par-
ticipants had been told not to lie if
questioned atthe airport, andthat
the weeklong program was now
in doubt. The program included a
project to renovate a school, give
participants tours, planttrees and
"get to know the Palestinian ter-
ritories."
"The aim of 'Welcome to Pal-
estine' is when we have guests
coming to Palestine - to Ramal-
lah, Hebron, to Bethlehem, they
should be able to say we are going
to Palestine and not to lie. They
(Israel) forbids people to visit,
they are controlling all the bor-
ders," she said.

In his hands, Roundtree develops a positive into his negative

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
There is a photograph on the
wall of Roy Roundtree's bed-
room. A reminder, he calls it,
of the greatest moment of his
career.
The photograph shows an
airborne Roundtree, then a red-
shirt junior, catching the game-
winning pass with just four
seconds left on the clock against

Notre Dame last September.
The photo is a reminder of
something else, too, a reminder
of why his hands are sore every
day, of why he spends as much
time at practice catching tennis
balls as he does footballs.
There are other iconic photos
of Michigan receivers. Desmond
Howard remains suspended
in midair, also against Notre
Dame, ready to cradle the most
famous reception of his career in

his outstretched hands. Braylon
Edwards is out-leaping a Michi-
gan State defender to catch the
game-winning pass in 2004 to
cap a 17-point fourth-quarter
comeback.
Again, in Edwards' snapshot,
he's plucking the ball out of the
air using his hands.
That's where Roundtree's
differs. In Roundtree's, the ball
is trapped rather awkwardly
between his wrists and his

chest, a no-no for receivers.
And that, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said after Satur-
day's Spring Game, is where
Roundtree has made the biggest
strides this offseason.
"(Roy) has really improved a
lot," Hoke said. "He's catching
the ball away from his body bet-
ter just throughout the spring."
Hoke also mentioned route
running as an area of improve-
ment, as Roundtree develops

into the Wolverines' most dan-
gerous and reliable receiv-
ing option. The route running
comes from maturity and expe-
rience in offensive coordinator
Al Borges' offense. The hands,
well, that takes more work.
As Howard said after Sat-
urday's game, "Someone here
asked a question. 'Is that just
something that comes with get-
ting a year older?' Nah, it doesn't
happen that way. You can be

a year older next year, you try
catching it away from your body
if you're not comfortable with it
now."
Catching away from the body
is important not only to limit
drops, but to lead to more yards
after the catch. Howard said
catching with the hands allows
receivers to maintain their
speed after a reception.
To emphasize catching passes

D ear Mom,
I'm sorry it took four
years for me to apologize.
You were in the kitchen,
remember? I told you to shut up,
like the punk

say things
like that to his
mother.
It was just'
as we were
leaving the

and you were
singing:
I want togo back to Michigan,
To dear Ann Arbor town,

To Mich-i-gan.
I didn't know I would be hum-

with so many people, but you
were the first.
That day, before freshman year,
you were smiling wide, I remem-
ber, and pumpi g your fists, and I
was shushing you.
Im sorry.
Back then, I hadn't sat and
talked all nightwith people who
would be considered strangers, if
only we hadn't gone to the same
university. I hadn't shown up at
a friend's Seder as a practicing
Catholic, expectingto know two
people, and known the whole
dinner party from somewhere
or another. I hadn't gone on a
midnight slushie run with Matt
Campbell. I hadn't dropped
everything, on one of those brisk
springnights to play midnight
games of one-on-one and to catch
up with Joe Stapleton on the
basketball courts outside of the
CCRB.
I hadn't known how lucky I
would be to have a mother who
shared her school with me.

when you first brought me here.
I was no older than 14, and
James must've been 12, but we
were too naive to appreciate those
places. I hope you weren't too
mad at us.

I tossed the football back and
forth over Tappan Street. You
wanted to stop and look around;
we wanted to keep going.
Now, I get it. I'm older, more
mature, but I've also lived here
for four years, trying my best to
channel my inner Ferris Buel-

pretty fast. If you don't stop and
look around once in a while, you
could miss it;"
It seems easier now to live like
the wheels in a clock, constantly
moving forward while witnessing
and living in the present and smil-
ing at the past.

It's easier for me, I think,
because Dad died when I was 7,
when he was first diagnosed, and
taught me to appreciate life up
until he passed away my fresh-
man year at Michigan.
Mom, thanks for raising James
and me as best you could.
And don't blame Dad, but his
Parkinson's disease drove me to
find something worth loving to do
for the rest of my life. I found The
Michigan Daily.
Mom, I'm sorry I'm not the

Despite injuries, youth, 'M' takes one from Penn State e

ByISABELLAACHENBACH
Daily Sports Writer
This weekend's three-game
series against Penn State sums
up the Michigan baseball team's
season pretty well - full of dra-
matic, and often unexpected, ups
and downs.
On Friday, Michigan won,
7-3. But Saturday's game took a
180-degree turn, and the Wolver-
ines suffered its greatest loss of
the season, 14-1. The team came
close to winning the series on
Sunday, but they couldn't quite
"get over the top," as Michigan
coach Rich Maloney says, and the
Wolverines lost again, 6-4.
A huge set-back for Michgan
right now is the amount of play-
ers who are out with injuries.
Freshman left fielder Will Drake,
sophomore right fielder Michael
O'Neill and redshirt senior right-
hander Travis Smith have all
recently been forced onto the

bench because of various hand
and foot-related injuries. Junior
shortstop Derek Dennis and red-
shirt senior right-hander Kolby
Wood are also out of the line-up
and have only made a few appear-
ances this entire season.
Redshirt junior left-hander
Bobby Brosnahan is another play-
er who's been hurting. Though he
does not have a serious nor iden-
tifiable injury, he hasn't had the
arm strength to start in games
the way he did in the start of the
season.
"He just needs to get (his arm)
stronger so it feels better for him
when he competes," Maloney
said. "Hopefully now that he's
had some time off he'll be coming
back pretty soon."
The lack of healthy starters
has put a lot of pressure on the
remaining players to perform
well in their place.
Senior right-hander Bran-
don Sinnery is one of the start-

ing pitchers who has played
exceptionally well in the past
few weeks. He started off the
weekend after having one of his
best performances in last week's
series against Michigan State,
in which he left the field with a
standing ovation, having allowed
no runs in 8.1 innings of work.
On Friday, Sinnery pitched a
complete game for the second
time this season. He allowed 10
hits, but just two earned runs
and an unearned run. He struck
out six Penn State hitters and has
improved his record to 3-3.
"Sinnery was outstanding,"
Maloney said.
The fifth inning locked in the
win for Michigan. The Wolver-
ines were down by one, but senior
catcher Coley Crank and sopho-
more first baseman Brett Winger
each got an RBI and redshirt
junior left fielder Kevin Krantz
got two.
The Nittany Lions scored once

more in the fifth, but that was
their last run across home plate.
Michigan scored twice more -
once in the eighth inning and
once in the ninth.
Friday was the highlight of
the Wolverines' weekend. Satur-
day, on the other hand, was the
lowlight of the weekend, if not of
their entire season.
Because so many players are
injured, many of the younger guys
are having to step up. That might
have been part of the problem on
Saturday.
"Some of these guys are thrust
into the line-up and, in some
cases, we're seeing some good
results, and in other cases we're
not seeing such good results,"
Maloney said.
Five pitchers split the time on
the mound, but the decision in the
14-1 loss was given to freshman
left-hander Trent Szkutnik, who
pitched two innings and gave up
five hits and six earned runs.

"This outing, (Szkutnik) strug-
gled," Maloney said. "But he's a
freshman and he's got good stuff.
We believe in him."
Freshman right-hander James
Bourque relieved Szkutnik on
the mound. His performance was
not much better, though, and he
allowed three runs in 2.1 innings.
Freshman right-hander Mike
Dolloff finished off the game for
Michigan. Once again, one of the
freshman pitchers let down the
team. Dolloff allowed four runs
in his inning of work.
Junior center fielder Patrick
Biondi knocked in the only Mich-
igan run of the game on a base hit
to right field.
"Unfortunately, because of the
situation that we're in with all
these different people being out,
we have to throw some people
in earlier than we would have
liked to," Maloney said. "But we
are very confident, and we think
over time it will pay off in the big
scheme of things. There's going
to be some ups and downs when
you're dealing with that many
inexperienced players."
Junior right-hander Ben Bal-
lantine thinks all of the freshman
are a great addition to the team,
and he's glad that the younger
players are getting more opportu-

nities now.
"We love having the younger
guys with us," he said. "They're
real supportive. We have all of
these freshmen in the dugout
with us, and they're the loudest
ones, cheering us on."
Ballantine played the first six
innings in Sunday's game and
allowed only one earned run and
one unearned run.
By the beginning of the sev-
enth inning, Penn State was up,
2-0. By the end of the inning,
Penn State was still up but the
score had changed, 5-3.
Both teams scored one more
run in the eighth, but Michigan
couldn't catch up in the top of the
ninth.
"We came down here on a mis-
sion to get the job done, and we
were close to doing that, but we
just couldn't get over the top,"
Maloney said.
Maloney is expecting that
none of the injured players will
be healthy enough to play in this
weekend's series against North-
western.
"Hopefully we'll get some of
these guys back, but in the mean-
time we've got to claw our way to
victory and try to win a couple
series this year just by battling,"
Maloney said.

Michiganloses'Battle at the Big House' to OSU :ESEB

By KYLE SAUKAS
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan lacrosse team
(1-11) played its first game against
rival Ohio State (6-6) Saturday,
competing on the biggest stage it
has seen this season. The inexpe-
rienced Wolverines put on a val-
iant show in Michigan Stadium
but fell to the Buckeyes, 12-9, in
front of a crowd of over 4,000.
The game was the hard hitting,
tough affair that is expected from
a Michigan-Ohio State matchup,
and the two teams struggled back
and forth throughout the contest.
Yet Michigan fell behind early in
the first quarter and couldn't seem
to pull together an effective run
to close the gap. Despite the loss,
the significance of the program's
first game against the Buckeyes
was not lost on team leaders such
as senior captain midfielder Alex
Vasileff, who won't receive a sec-
ond chance against Ohio State.
"This is an opportunity I am
really thankful to have," Vasileff
said. "I thought (the team) left it
all out there. I am really proud
of them ... but unfortunately, we
came up short.".
The Wolverines had their work
cut out for them Saturday after-
noon. The Buckeyes rank seventh
nationally in scoring defense,
allowing just 7.64 goals per game,
and 16th in forced turnovers with
8.27 per game.
QUARTERBACKS
From Page 1B
at times when Gardner entered
games last season. Though he's
entering his third season at
Michigan, Gardner has yet to
prove he can be consistent in the
pocket.
And Bellomy is even more
inexperienced, having taken a
redshirt in his first season and
never having seen the field.
"(Saturday was) really his first
kind of real snaps in Michigan
Stadium," Hoke said. "I don't
know how many people were
here, but there was TV, all that
kind of stuff. I just (wanted to)
see how he would handle him-
self, the way he handled the
huddle.
"Again, until you really look at
it and analyze it, (I thought) he
handled himself OK."
Indeed, Bellomy didn't seem
like a nervous rookie at any
 point during the Spring Game.
ROUNDTREE

with the hands, every receiver has
worked with a machine that flings
tennis balls after every prac-
tice this spring. Receivers like
Roundtree can't trap tennis balls.
If they want to make the catch,
they have to use their hands.
"I feel like it has really helped
all of us," Roundtree said, noting
that the balls often come in at 60
miles per hour. "It's coming. It's
really coming. So it's something
you gotta get used to, but once you
calm down and actually time it
up and actually watch the ball hit

Michigan found itself down by
two goals early, with only Vasileff
findingthe net in the first quarter
for the first of his three goals. The
second quarter saw the Wolver-
ines matching the Buckeyes with
four goals each, and they felt con-
fident coming out of the tunnel in
the second half.
"We felt like we had a pretty
good set ready to go," said Michi-
gan coach John Paul. "We came
into the (second half) pretty con-
fident about some of the things
we were doing. But we knew they
were going to come out with a lot
of intensity."
The Buckeyes tallied three
consecutive goals ' in the third
quarter, leaving the Wholverines
to fight their way back from a
five-goal deficit. The only spark
of life came from senior faceoff
man Brian Greiner's goal, and the
quarter ended with a 10-6 score
in Ohio State's favor. Michigan
outscored Ohio State 3-2 in the
fourth quarter with goals from
Vasileff, fifth-year senior Trevor
Yealy and junior midfielder Wil-
lie Steenland. Yet that final push
wasn't enough for the Wolverines
to overcome a Buckeye offense
that had control the entire game.

against the Wolverines.
AlongwithOhio State'sempha-
sis on transitional scoring, Michi-
gan faced a disciplined offense
that used passing to make the
Wolverine defenders move. Ohio
State took advantage of Wolverine
players that were caught watching
the ball, leaving Buckeye players
open to take uncontested shots.
Even with those defensive weak-
nesses, Paul was proud of the play
of freshman goalie Emil Weiss.

The 12 saves that Weiss made
against an experienced opponent
and his improvement in other
areas of the game is what Paul is
looking for in all of his players in
major games.
"I thought he played great,"
Paul said. "He has just gotten
more comfortable as a freshman
playing Division I goalie."
Despite the loss, the Wolver-
ines will be taking more out of
Saturday's game than just another

check in the loss column. Coach-
es and players see this game as
a stepping-stone that will help
build the program to a point
where success against Ohio State
isn't hoped for, but expected.
"We take a lot out of the way we
played today," Paul said. "We've
made tremendous strides in every
area over the course of this sea-
son. Our mission all year as 'Team
One' is to lay the foundation for
what this program is goingto be."


Playing exclusively with the
second team of offensive players
- a noticeably weaker unit than
the first team, considering the
Wolverines' depth issues - the
Arlington, Texas native played
with poise all afternoon.
Bellomy didn't make many
plays downfield, but he never
seemed rattled in the pocket
and was content to settle for
open checkdowns when deeper
receivers were covered.
By doing so, he kept the
offense in rhythm and displayed
some athleticism, too - he
didn't make anyone forget about
Robinson, but he was competent
enough when executing zone
reads and escaping pressure
when it came.
Robinson saw that Bellomy-
was throwing the ball well dur-
ing warmups and went over to
offer some encouragement, tell-
ing Bellomy to just continue that
into the game. Clearly, the red-
shirt freshman took the senior's
advice.
"He's learning the offense,"'

Robinson said. "He got used to
the offense (during spring prac-
tice), and now he's actually help-
ing me sometimes. He's doing
well."
But while Bellomy played
calmly and kept his bearing,
Gardner was unsteady and
lacked composure inthe pocket.
Gardner was uneven as soon
as he stepped on the field with
the first-string offense. On his
first play from scrimmage, he
rolled to the right looking to
throw, but he ran into junior
defensive tackle Jibreel Black
and was forced to take a sack.
On Gardner's next pass play,
he checked down to his second
receiver but gave sophomore
cornerback Blake Countess
too much time to make a read.
Countess stepped in front of the
lofted pass for the easy intercep-
tion.
It didn't get much better from
there for the junior.
Gardner went on to miss his
first four pass attempts and
was often harassed by pressure,

leading to throwaways and inef-
fective scrambles. Toward the
end of the scrimmage, he finally
got the offense moving, scram-
bling down the right sideline for
a first down and then connect-
ing with redshirt junior wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon for his
first completion and a long gain
down the field.
But for most of the Spring
Game, the story for Gardner was
ineffectiveness.
Still - and despite some
rumors of looks at receiver for
the Detroit native this spring -
Hoke said Gardner is the No. 2
quarterback, and coaches said
his uneven performance on Sat-
urday wasn't indicative of his
play during spring practice in
general.
"Devin, in particular, has had
an outstanding spring," Borges
said. "He's done some very nice
things and has developed in a
position where he needs more
time in situations like this, when
there's a lot of people watching
and the pressure's on and all

that."
of course, for all the atten-
tion that Bellamy and Gard-
ner received during the Spring
Game, when the season begins,
the focus will definitively be on
Robinson and his improvement.
He, too, had a productive spring,
and Borges said he has made
significant strides in avoiding
throwing off his back foot and in
his decision-making.
But should one of the backups
need to answer the call at some
point next season, the hope is
that the experience that Bellomy
and Gardner have gained this
spring and in the Spring Game
will make the backup quarter-
back situation less precarious
than it has been in recent years.
"We have three quarterbacks
who - I'm not sure when their
major contributions are going
to come, two of them, anyway -
but I think there'll be a point in
time when they'll make a major
contribution," Borges said. "But
I've been happy with the posi-
tion."

seen out of Black, but the junior
will need to gain more weight
this summer and really hone his
technique to tussle with Big Ten
guards and tackles. Campbell, list-
ed at 322 pounds, has all the size
he needs and is looking to estab-
lish consistency.
"We need (Campbell) to not just
knock people around, but tackle
the football," Mattison said. "Will
and I have talked a lot and hard
about that, that the ball is the
issue, not how many lumps you
can put on that guard or that cen-
ter. Will's getting it, and Will's a
key. Will is abig key.
"You've heard me say it before -
you're only as strong as you are
down the middle. That's going
to be our whole deal this year
because we'll be fine outside."
Campbell actually made his spring
debut in lighter fashion than
usual, as he and some of his defen-
sive cohorts were recently tasked
with losing weight leading up to
Saturday.
"I felt ... a lot
lighter."
Some players showed off their new
look by sporting cutoff tees expos-
ing their fit and trim bellies.
"I felt good today, actually - aslot
lighter than I usually am," Camp-
bell said. "I feel comfortable with
the D-line we have right now. We
got some more nooks and knots to
pull out, but I feel pretty good with
it right now."
Moving back from the line, Mat-
tison noted that his middle line-
backers also have a their work cut
out for them this summer.
Fifth-year senior Kenny Demens
is currently the leader of the unit,
but there will be competition up
until the start of the season.
Senior Brandin Hawthorne also
moved to the middle from his typi-
cal strongside position for some
plays on Saturday. He made a
couple of solid defensive stops and
reeled in a one-handed intercep-
tion in coverage toward the end of
the game.
"(Hawthorne) has been doing a
greatjob," Demens said.
"He has the heart of a champion.
He might be a little undersized,
but I wouldn't put it past him to go
out there and hit the biggest guy
and put him on his butt."
But sometimes, a defense needs
more than heart to succeed. Matti-
son is looking forward to working
on the little things this summer.
"A lot of it is technique," Mattison
said.
"One of the biggestthings we have
to improve on is using our hands
and not using our high-school
forearms. That's what some young
freshmen linebackers are doing
right now.
"The beautiful thing is they've got
sleds to work on all summer."
NOTES: Sophomore outside
linebacker Desmond Morgan

being stopped on a blitz early in
Saturday's game. Redshirt sopho-

extent of the injuries are unknown

With the graduation of Junior

into a threat for senior quarter-

inson said he already benefits
from Roundtree's versatility. He
is equally effective as the slot

Robinson also said that

RAWLS
 From Page 1B
How is that different from
last season?
"He's not as spazzy as he
was before," Roh said, laugh-
ing. "He'd get the ball and fall
over, basically. I think now he's
starting to get his stride a little
bit, where he's making cuts and
making good decisions."
With a year of experience
under his belt - and his first
spring camp out of the way -
Rawls will be a serious contend-
er for the No. 2 running back
position in the fall.
"He's not the tallest guy,"

Kovacs said. "He's short and
stocky, but he runs hard (and) he
lowers his pads.
"Sometimes, he doesn't real-
ly see where he's going, but he
makes his own way and just puts
his head down and runs hard. As
a defense, you respect that."
NOTE: The football program
did not sell tickets to the Mott
Spring Game on Saturday, but it
did accept donations at the sta-
dium and through a text-mes-
saging system.
According to Athletic Depart-
ment officials, the event raised
over $161,000 for the C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, not includ-
ing the text-message donations.
That number will reportedly be
matched by a University alum.

One Last Season
Chronicling the senior years of Stuart Douglass and Alex Hunt

Sitting on the bleachers inside an empty
Cliff Keen Arenaon a gloomy afternoon
in mid-November, Alex Hunt scanned
a photo that epitomizes pure joy. The image
is offer, atthe age of 16, wearing a huge
smile across her face while she holds a medal
draped around her neck. It was taken after
her club volleyball team won the state cham-
pionship to qualify for nationals - an eternity
ago. These weren't better or worse times, just
different.
"Good feelings, definitely good feelings,"
Alex said, turningthe photo over in her hands.
Eyes fixated on the photo, she stopped her--
self, lost for words.
"These are just good memories; it was just
a lot of fun. God, it's so funny looking back at
these - I was really skinny."
Just weeks before her competitive volley-
balls days would end, she stared at what her
career had been. It all seemed so surreal now.
"It felt like there never was an end to volley-
ball. Looking at this photo, at this point, I had
six years of volleyball left. It's weird to think
about it because now I only have less than two
weeks left."
Six years earlier, it all seemed endless: the
nonstop workouts, endless traveling for club-
volleyball tournaments and continual college
recruiting trips. But here she sat, alone on the
bleachers with justfour games left in the regu-
lar season, facingthe twilight of her career.
A month later, in the middle of Decem-
ber, Stuart Douglass sat inside the Stephen
Ross Academic Center feeling grateful for his
health. The previous night, he received a text
message from a friend and old training part-
ner who had just suffered a career-endingACL
injury.
"Things can just happen in a heartbeat
that you can never expect, and it can change
your career," he said. "It definitely makes you
appreciate your time. You know, I haven't had
the games or the success that I wanted so far
this year, but those types of things kind of put
a different perspective on it and it makes you
appreciate all the games you play.
"It kind of puts more emotion into counting
down the games until it's all over."
Alex and Stuart are far from alone. One hun-
dred and eleven athletes had the word "senior"
printed alongside their name on a Michigan
varsity roster this past year. Most will gradu-
ate in May and won't play their sport profes-
sionally and might never play it again. This is
the end for all of them - if not their athletic
careers, then at least their amateur careers -
and that alone makes for an emotional year.
The Michigan Daily spent the last year with
Douglass and Hunt, chronicling whatcould be

their final seasons.
BEGINNING OF THE END
This was the beginning of the end. Alex
Hunt knew this.
In four quick months, her career would be
over. And yet, in the middle of August, she
yearned for the start of the upcoming vol-
leyball season. She was anxious to get back to
competition.
As she prepared for her senior year and her
final season asa Michigan Wolverine, Alex
had made up her mind that there would be no
next level for her, no new organization to rep-
resent and no new teammates to play along-
side. She seemed at ease with her decision
- almost as if she realized that her illustrious
career was serendipitous, that she happened
upon this sport by pure accident.
"To be honest, I kind of got peer-pressured
into playing," Alex said, laughing. "It's funny
that I even remember this, but in third grade
there was a sign-up sheet that went around
for the (volleyball) teams for the following
year. I remember that I was the only girl in my
entire grade that didn't sign up just because
I had no interest in playingsports at all - it
wasn't my thing. But then I ended up playing
the next year just because everyone else did
and I ended up just falling in love with the
game."
If being introduced to volleyball happened
by chance, becoming a star did not. Deter-
mined to excel, Alex worked hard to continu-
ally improve. She spent countless hours with
her dad in their garage to-develop her serve
and other parts of her game.
"I remember hating going out there so
much," Alex said with a chuckle. "It would be
freezingcold - I would be bundled up and
would still practice."
Alex has sacrificed a lot, both socially and
academically, for her volleyball career. She
was driven by incentive.
"I think my ultimate goal was to go to col-
lege, get college paid for, and go to a school
that I probably wouldn't be able to get into
academically."
Alex recognized that this was the choice
she made, and she's extremely proud of her
volleyball career - and rightfully so.
Entering her senior year, she'd achieved a
long list of accomplishments: MVP of the USA
Junior Olympic Girls' Volleyball Champion-
ship 16-year-old National Division in 2006,
gold medal at the NORCECA Girls Youth
Continental Championship in 2006, two-time
first team all-state selection in high school,
unanimous selection to the All-Big Ten
Freshman team in 2008, selection to the U.S.
Women's Junior National Team in 2009, and

an AVCA Third Team All-American selection
as a junior in 2010. Her namels also scattered
across Michigan's record books.
She's appreciative of the opportunities the
sport has provided her, including a chance to
play overseas when her collegiate career ends
- if she wants to.
It's a tempting offer.,
Undoubtedly, she could make an impact for
several professional volleyball teams over-
seas. It's a great opportunity, which is why
it was surprising when she voiced the next
three words to me without even the slightest
bit of hesitation:
"This is it."
It could have been the beginning of the end.
Stuart hoped differently.
But in early October, one week before full-
team practices started, Stuart took a seat in a
study room on the second floor inside the Ross
Academic Center, but he was not thinking
about his future. Playing professionally, a pos-
sible end to his career, job searching - these
were the furthest thoughts from his mind.
"I haven't really thought about the end at
all. I just really want time to speed up so we
can get practices started, and I want time to
speed up so we can get the games started."
Even with the departure of guard Darius
Morris to the NBA, the preseason workouts
provided an encouraging sign for Stuart. He
was excited, almost edgy, to get onto the court.
His senior season, he thought, was his time to
shine, his time to lead.
Yes, as a junior and with the team lack-
ing seniors, Stuart was forced into leadership
responsibilities last year: He assumed a cap-
tain position, a role he wasn't yet comfortable
with. But with another year of experience
under his belt, he was loose. He was enthusi-
astic about the chance to help the incoming
freshman acclimate to Michigan.
"The pressure is off, more so than it has
been in other years. I'm just mentally relaxed."
Stuart received a Fisher Price basketball
hoop for Christmas as a youngster. Several
years later, before he became a teenager, he
told his parents that he wanted to play col-
legiate basketball. They chuckled, but he was
serious.
Whereas most athletes play multiple sports
in junior high school and in high school, espe-
cially at small schools, Stuart decided early-on
that he was going to devote all of his time to
basketball. He stopped playing other sports
competitively during the sixth grade.
"I loved baseball, and I still love playing it
whenever I can, but I didn't want to play any-
more because I just wanted to focus on basket-

ball. But I never really looked back and I never
regretted it at all."
His family moved from Cicero, Ind. to Car-
mel, Ind. just weeks before his sophomore
year in high school, in large part to give Stu-
art more basketball exposure. It was a painful
experience - moving from a tight-knit town
to a large Indianapolis suburb - but Stuart's
dream was to play in the Big Ten.
He would later turn down an offer to play
basketball for Colorado because it wasn't Big
Ten basketball. His parents didn't say any-
thing.
Then Harvard came calling, and even with-
out an offer from Michigan or any other school
in the conference, he didn't accept that offer
either - he was holding out for Michigan. His
mother, Nancy, was worried. She feared that
her son would miss out on the right opportu-
nity waiting for a call that might never come.
As he approached the start of his senior sea-
son at Michigan, all Stuart wanted was to keep
playing. He knew his future after Michigan
was dependent on the upcoming season, on
how well he performed.
The Big Tenhad always been his dream, but
now he wanted more.
THE SEASON
December 8 - Stuart slid into a chair in the
lobby of the Ross Academic Center. It was
barely a month into the season, but he seemed
exhausted. Maybe all the traveling the team
had done had taken its toll on him, or maybe it
was his inconsistent play. Whatever the cause
was, he looked weary.
"Things have gone by pretty fast," Stuart
admitted.
Three weeks earlier, he was loose. He
wasn't worried. He wasn't stressed. He was
at ease.
But one month into the season, things had
changed. No longer waiting for his senior
season to start, he was nine games into the
season and trying to slow things down.
"It makes you appreciate how much time
you had at such a great school. The emotions
are starting to build up a little bit - you don't
really notice it - when you think that you're
never going to get thatgame back or that
you're never going to play this team again. It's
just kind of weird to think about."
Since scoring 14 points, grabbing five
boards and dishing four assists in the season-
opener against Ferris State, Stuart had mixed
poor showings with efficient performances.
He was pressing and it was unsettling
for him. With every sub-par game came the
weight of unmet expectations - his own lofty
expectations - and his lasting legacy.
"It's one last game you have to make a last-

ing impression on people, and after this year
you very well may be easily forgotten. Every
day you're working to make your impression
and it is added pressure. It is added pressure
that I didn't really expect thinking about it at
the beginning of the year."
Or maybe the pressure had always been
there, quiet, unacknowledged. Maybe it was
there from the day he turned down Harvard.
But it didn't matter when the pressure
settled, just that it did. What Stuart needed
then was to rid himself of all the expectations
and justplay basketball. He needed it to be
fun again.
"You thought senior year you were going
to let loose and be more comfortable. It hasn't
quite turned out howI wanted it to."
And then the conversation turned towards
his future.
"(Flaying professionally is) the kind of
thingI want. No matter how short it is, or
how little I play, or even if I don't play at all -
it will be just another learning experience."
And as Stuart noted, though it would have
been smart for him to start preparing for a
life without basketball and thinking about an
alternative plan just in case, he just couldn't
get himself to think about it. He wanted to put
off job-searching until later so he could focus
solely on basketball.
"I don't want to put too many eggs in one
basket."
He paused, and then confessed:
"But sometimes, it's hard notto."
October18 - Fear.
That's what motivated Alex more than
anything. She feared her career ending before
she wanted it to, and she feared playing poorly
during the final weeks of her career - she
feared leaving the wrong legacy behind.
Four weeks earlier, this uneasiness
wouldn't have arisen. Alex was playing well
and had helped the Wolverines to an unde-
feated nonconference record, 12-0. But in the
middle of October, fear, rational fear, slowly
crept into her mind. She was battered, both
physically and mentally, and the Wolverines
were just 3-5 since winning the Michigan/
Adidas Invitational, planting them in the
middle of the Big Ten standings.
Three days earlier, Michigan barely
squeaked past cellar-dweller Northwestern
in five sets - a team that had only one win in
seven conference games entering the matchup
- to halta four-game losingstreak. But if the
Wolverines didn't improve quickly, the far-
fetched ideaof Michigan not earning a bid
to the NCAA Tournament would become a

And as the buzzer sounded at
9:27 p.m., and Stuart walked off
the court for the last time as a
Wolverine, the reality, the loss,
finally hit him.
"I was just telling myself, 'It

my mind. I thought that the third

Then came acceptance - and

him smile.

not having to worry about the
scrutiny from all different angles
- that's another thing that's hard
to put into words. The pressure
is off in terms of dealing with the
strains of a season. It was kind of
nice."
Though Stuart was unsatis-
fied with his last few games, he's
happy with his accomplishments
at Michigan. He was a part of
three NCAA Tournament teams
and helped resurrect a forgotten
program. He hit his fair share of
big shots, and in his lastyear, he
played a significant role in Michi-
gan's first Big Ten Championship
since 1986. He ranks fifth all-time
in three-pointers made with 205
and never missed a game his
entire Michigan career. Some
games he started, other games
he didn't, but he played a part in
all 136 Michigan games since he
arrived here four years ago.
"If I never playagain, (I'll be)
peacefully happy. I could have
had better stats if I played some-
where else, not in the Big Ten
- I've thought about that before,
and I think that it's natural. ButI
wanted to play in the Big Ten."
He interrupts himself, search-
ing for the right words.
"It really just came down to
proving people wrong. I feel like
ever since I got the Michigan
scholarship, people have said that
I shouldn't be in the Big Ten, so
from that standpoint I'm happy -
but I want to keep playing."
Stuart had taken the lasttwo
weeks tostep away from basket-
ball, to rest his body and reener-
gize, but it was alot harder than
he expected.
"You have all this time on your
hands that you don't know really
know what to do with. You try
to take time off, but you just get
bored. It's a weird feeling."
He's still thirsty. He wants to
know what it's like to play bas-
ketball without the pressures of
classes. And he wants to prove
- to all those people who said he
would never make it to the Big
Ten and to those who say he can't
play professionally - that he can
continue his career elsewhere.
But most of all, he wants to prove
it to himself. He wants to prove
to himself that all the sacrifices
he made were worth it. He wants
to play as long as he's capable of
competing at an elite level.
Regret, he said, is ahard thing
to deal with.
For Stuart and Alex, it's not
just a sport that they're giving up
- it's a way of life, a culture. It's
a lengthy period of their life that
they have devoted to excellence in
athletics.
For Alex, she's walking away
from Michigan - from the sport
she loves - hoping to give it all
back, one day at a time. She's head-
ed to Indianapolis, starting a job

in sales and management for Pepsi
in early June and hoping to find
a club team that she could lend
assistance to.
For Stuart, he leaves Michigan
with a sense of uncertainty and
faith - hoping to keep playing the
sport he loves overseas but not
knowing if he'll ever step on the
court for a professional basketball
organization. With a degree in
economics, he'll have other career
options. But he wants to drain
every last ounce out of basketball
before he embarks on a new path,
possibly in the financialworld.
It's tough for him to say how
long he will give himself before he
decides to pursue another profes-
sion.
In the middle of February, sit-
tingat atable inthe Caribou Coffee
on Stadium and Packard, I asked
Nancy and Matt Douglass how
tough they thought it would be
for Stuart when he finally stopped
playing basketball competitively.
Though the response was focused
on Stuart, Nancy could have been
talking about any number of ath-
letes graduating from Michigan.
"I can't imagine what it will be
like. It's one of those things that
until you walk a mile in those
shoes, I can't answer what that'll
be like. And I never will, because
I've never done it."

SOFTBALL

Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team
found its groove. Again.
In a season that has seen
the offense as both a dominant
force and a weakness, it's hard

gan (12-1
Big Ten, 30-11 overall) took the
field at Michigan State (0-12,
11-30) on Saturday in the first of
a three-game series, it was any-
body's game.
Except it wasn't.
The 20th-ranked Wolverines
started slow, but after an eight-
run fifth inning, the game ended
with the mercy rule and an 8-0
Michigan victory.
"I thought (that in) the first
four-and-a-half innings we
looked just like Wednesday" said
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
on Saturday, referencing the
team's 1-0 loss to Western Mich-
igan earlier in the week. "We're
not commanding (the) zone and
it really looks like we're not
focusing. It took us until we got
a couple runs on the board (in
the fifth) to get a little bit of con-
fidence and a little momentum
going, and then we took some
really healthy cuts."
Their momentum carried over
to Sunday, when they played a
rain-delayed double header at
home and won 2-0 and 5-0.
"We should talk about the
zeros," Hutchins said. "That's a
big deal to shut them out three
times in a row."
The second game on Sunday
took a strange turn in the second

inning. Freshman catcher Lau-
ren Sweet hit an RBI double to
left center, but Hutchins made
a mistake with the numbers in
the lineup on the scorecard,
negating the run and ending the
inning.
After the situation was sorted
out, Michigan took the field and
quickly got three batters out, but
it wasn't until the bottom of the
fourth inning that its offense
started to mesh again. With
two outs and runners on second
and third, junior shortstop Amy
Knapp hit an RBI single that
sent two runners home.
The offense took control in
the sixth inning, when freshman
right-hander Sara Driesenga hit
a solo home run and Sweet hit a
two-run home run.
The story of the game, how-
ever, was freshman left-hander
Haylie Wagner on the mound.
She pitched a two-hitter while
striking out five. The most
impressive aspect of her day was
the efficiency of her pitches - in
seven innings she just threw 68
pitches.
"My spins were working, all
my mechanics were working,"
Wagner said. "It's just some-
thing that I've been working
on in the last week, (and) I just
want to jump back up where I
know I can be."
Added Hutchins: "Pitching
has to hold them. And they did.
It was really the key to the week-
end."
In Sunday's first game, the
offense started quickly after
junior second baseman Ashley
Lane notched her 28th RBI of
the season, sending sophomore
right fielder Lyndsay Doyle
home with a single.
In addition, senior first base-
man Amanda Chidester went
3-for-4 to lead the team that had
nine total hits.

Meanwhile, on the mound,
Driesenga allowed six hits,
struck out two and managed to
get out of tight situations when
the Spartans were in scoring
position. Driesenga also contrib-
uted at the plate by going 2-for-3
with an RBI.
"Sara's been hitting since the
first home game of the year, and
she has given me no reason to
think any different," Hutchins
said. "She's done a great job.
She got the bunts down, and she
bombs it over the fence."
Saturday's game was dedicat-
ed to moving past Wednesday's
1-0 loss to Western Michigan,
and the Wolverines did just that.
After going nine innings
without getting a runner to
third base, the Wolverines broke
through in the third inning and
never looked back, getting 11
batters to third base in total.
"We talked a lot on Thursday,
and I just said, 'Look, these are
the things we did in the game
(Wednesday), and we don't do
those in practice,' " Hutchins
said. "I reminded them of that
today before the fifth inning. I
said, 'Look, you don't swing at
some of this stuff at practice. Be
up on the plate more, be up in
front, and obviously that turned
our offense around."
Getting the Wolverines start-
ed on Saturday, senior center-
fielder Bree Evans had the first
two hits of the day. The first
score came from a double by
Wagner that sent two runners
home.
It was Wagner's first at bat
since March 16 and her first hit
since March 3.
"(Wagner's) been hitting the
heck out of the ball, and she's a
good hitter," Hutchins said. "I
expect she'll be in our lineup.
She hasn't been recently, but
she's going to be a hitter for us."
