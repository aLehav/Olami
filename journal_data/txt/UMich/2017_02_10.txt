Over 
100 
students 
and 

faculty members congregated 
on the Diag on Thursday 
to rally against President 
Donald Trump’s recent ban 
on immigration from seven 
predominantly 
Muslim 

countries.

President 
Trump’s 

executive 
order 
has 

temporarily suspended the 
immigration of citizens and 
refugees from Iran, Iraq, 
Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen 
and Somalia from entering 
the United States. While a 
nationwide block has been 
placed on the ban by U.S. 
District Senior Judge James 
Robart in Seattle, the Trump 
administration is currently 
working on an appeal.

The rally was organized 

by a group called Academic 
United — No to Visa and 
Immigration 
Ban: 
U 

Michigan, in an attempt to 
show their support for the 
immigrants, 
refugees 
and 

permanent 
U.S. 
residents 

affected 
by 
the 
ban. 

Organizers also spoke of the 
recent racist and anti-Semitic 
emails sent to students of the 
College of Engineering on 
Tuesday night, offering a sit-
in to provide support.

A primary event organizer, 

who 
wished 
to 
remain 

anonymous due to concerns 
about her immigration status 

from a country impacted by 
the executive order, stated 
the rally’s goal was to “raise 
awareness to the University 
of 
Michigan 
community 

so they will know that the 
people 
who 
are 
affected 

by this executive order are 
actually 
their 
colleagues, 

their friends, their lab-mates, 

and people who they interact 
with on a day-to-day basis.”

The goal of Academics 

United- 
No 
to 
Visa 
and 

Immigration 
Ban 
rallies, 

according to their Facebook 
page, 
is 
“to 
demonstrate 

the impact of this action 
on thousands of honest and 
ambitious students.”

Along with the rally and 

sit-in provided for students 
affected by the hate emails 
sent to College of Engineering 
students, organizers of the 
rally provided an open mic for 
those wishing to share their 
stories or relate messages of 
hope and inspiration to the 

Following

and anti-Semitic emailssent

students 
Tuesday 

night, an anonymous email was 
sent out Thursday morning to 
at least one graduate student 
email list, this time outlining 
an alleged incident of racism 
involving the sender, a Black 
woman, and two white men. 
The email expressed disgust 
with the University for failing 
to address the alleged hate 
crime with an investigation.

University police, however, 

say they recieved the email tip 
a month ago and attempted to 
contact the sender, to no avail. 

The 
email 
— 
entitled 

“Pathetic, 
Outraged 
and 

Disgusted!!” 
reads:

want to hear a freaking thing 
about racist emails!! I love the

The U.S. Senate confirmed 

Betsy DeVos as secretary of 
education, with Vice President 
Mike 
Pence 
casting 
an 

unprecedented 
tie-breaking 

vote Tuesday.

Despite a 24-hour effort 

by Senate Democrats to hold 
the floor in protest of DeVos’ 
confirmation, 
they 
were 

unable to convince another 
Republican to change his or 
her vote.

The Michigan native has 

been criticized for her lack 
of public school experience, 
which led Senate Minority 
Leader 
Charles 
Schumer 

(D–N.Y.) 
to 
describe 
her 

as 
“uniquely 
unqualified,” 

a phrase originally coined 
by former President Barack 
Obama 
in 
reference 
to 

President Donald Trump.

Additionally, 
many 

Democrats, 
including 
Sen. 

Debbie Stabenow (D–Mich.), 
expressed 
concern 
about 

DeVos’ 
focus 
on

schools, which have proved

unsuccessful

Ray Jackson and Jimmy 

King, two members of the Fab 
Five — the 1991 recruiting 
class for the University of 
Michigan 
basketball 
team 

— discussed the stereotypes 
surrounding 
Black 
male 

athletes, including athletics 
overshadowing 
academics 

and exploitation by brands. 
Jackson and King, joined 
by Maurice Ways, current 
football player and former 
Michigan and NFL football 
player 
Braylon 
Edwards, 

discussed the stereotypes and 
misrepresentations of Black 
athletes Thursday night in 
the Robertson Theatre in the 
Ross School of Business.

LSA junior Maurice Ways 

began the night by speaking 
to his experience as a student 
athlete and going over his 
daily 
schedule, 
including 

when he has to fit in classes 
and when he has time that 
isn’t taken up by school or 

athletics. Ways emphasized 
how 
people 
often 
don’t 

consider 
athletes 
to 
be 

students as well.

“Someone 
told 
me 
the 

only reason you’re going to 
Michigan is to play football,” 
Ways 
said. 
“There’s 
a 

stereotype about the Black 
male athlete that he’s either/
or … I can be whatever I need 
to be whenever I need to be 
it.”

Ways 
talked 
about 
the 

number of African-American 
men at the University and 
the 
number 
of 
African-

American male athletes. Only 
740 of the 43,000 students 
at the University are African 
American men. 

“The football team makes 

up more than half of the 
Black male athletes at the 
University 
of 
Michigan,” 

Ways quipped.

Penebaker,

trainer

The protestors expressed discontent about the University’s response to the incidents

Students4Justice held a sit-

in at the Michigan Union as 
a response to the emails sent 
to 
University 
of 
Michigan 

engineering 
and 
computer 

science undergraduate students 
and the defilement of a prayer 
rug in the reflection room in 
the 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 

Library.

The event began Thursday 

with a march of approximately 

60 students from the Diag to 
the Union, which they planned 
to occupy until it closed at 2 
a.m. The crowd grew in size 
as the marchers chanted and 
progressed to the Union.

Chants included slogans such 

as: “No justice, no peace, no 
racist police,” and “No alt-right, 
no KKK, no fascist USA.” 

Once at its destination, the 

group wound its way through 
the building before spreading 
out to occupy the study rooms on 
the first floor. Over 150 students 
and community members took 

part in the sit-in. Fliers were 
circulated that had a condensed 
version of the letter of demands 
that Students4Justice wrote in 
response to the racist fliers that 
first appeared last fall.

Members of the organization 

said they wanted their voices 
to 
be 
heard. 
LSA 
junior 

Victoria Johnson, a leader of 
Students4Justice, said she does 
not believe the University’s 
response has been sufficient.

“We 
feel 
like 
the 

administration 
hasn’t 
done 

enough,” she said. “It has been 

silent. They’re not showing up 
and giving the support that is 
needed to the students that 
have 
been 
attacked. 
We’re 

going to sit in the union until 
they meet our demands.”

Participants 
of 
the 
sit-

in 
worked 
on 
homework 

assignments, chatted with those 
around them and decorated the 
Union with posters and various 
flags. LSA freshman Maria 
Tout said she noticed a feeling 
of inclusiveness even though 
the sit-in was a protest.

The University of Michigan’s 

Central Student Government 

hosted a Twitter town hall 

Thursday afternoon, asking 

students and other CSG 

members to submit questions 

to Regents Shauna Ryder Diggs 

(D) and Andrea Newman (R) by 

using the hashtag #AskARegent.

Many of the questions 

touched on campus concerns 

that have risen over the past few 

weeks, including racist and anti-

Semitic emails, crime alerts 

and President Donald Trump’s 

recent executive orders halting 

immigration on several Muslim-

majority countries.

Several questions pertained 

to tuition at the University. 

Currently, it costs lower-

division students $7,037 for 

undergrad — an increase from 

the 2015-2016 school year’s 

$6,764 2014-2015’s $6,579.

Many students asked how 

they could further play a role 

in the University and connect 

with the Board of Regents. Last 

semester, many students felt the 

Regents lacked transparency. 

CSG hosted a similar town 

hall last semester, with Newman 

and Regent Mark Bernstein (D). 

The student government has 

also taken steps to instating 

student voices on the board 

through the new Student 

Advisory Council. In early 

September, the board also voted 

and passed a bylaw to do so.

“That bylaw highlights the 

importance of student input in 

University decision making,” 

CSG President David Schafer, 

an LSA senior, said during the 

meeting. “To reiterate, let’s 

not view this bylaw as the 

final product but rather as a 

foundation upon which more 

specific efforts can be built that 

match the spirit of this bylaw.”

The town hall with Newman 

and Diggs lasted for an hour.

Former Michigan and NFL Wide Receiver Braylon Edwards discusses the Black Male 
Athlete and “Who Is He & What Is He To You?” at Ross on Thursday.

ATHLETES SPE AK OUT

The Panhellenic Association 

at the University of Michigan 
partnered with the University’s 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center to host the 
second annual Greek Life Speak 
Out at the Pendleton Room of 
the Union on Thursday.

In front of a full-capacity 

audience of about 250 people, 
survivors of sexual assault came 
forward to speak about their 
experiences in an open-forum 
setting. Women spoke about 
instances of sexual assault they 
have experienced within and 
outside the Greek life system or 
beyond the University.

Panhellenic peer educators 

— sorority members trained to 
assist and support survivors 
within their sororities — were 

also on hand, with some sharing 
their own personal stories.

Due 
to 
the 
confidential 

nature of the event, the Daily 
was asked to not record or quote 
speakers.

Kinesiology 
junior 
Cass 

Bouse-Eaton, 
co-director 
of 

the Panhellenic Peer Educator 
Program, said she spearheaded 
the event after being inspired 
to provide a forum specifically 
for people in Greek life after 
attending a SAPAC speak out 
two years ago.

“I just feel like this was 

something that wasn’t talked 
about in Greek life as a whole,” 
Bouse-Eaton said. “I thought it 
would be special to have a place 
where people in Greek life could 
speak about their experiences, 
because our experiences are 
sometimes different.”

Bouse-Eaton said she hopes 

people will walk away from the 

event empowered and open to 
listening and providing support 
to others.

“People are not always going 

to show you when they’re 
hurting,” 
Bouse-Eaton 
said. 

“Be 
conscious 
that 
people 

might be. If someone does 
feel comfortable telling you 
something, you don’t need to 
do anything other than say: ‘I 
believe you and whatever you 
need I am here.’ ”

LSA junior Kelsey Snyder, 

another PPEP co-director, said 
bringing awareness to sexual 
assault on campus is key and it 
was encouraging to see so many 
male audience members there 
in support of the women who 
spoke.

“You just want people to be 

more aware of what’s going on,” 
Snyder said. “It was also really 
great this year to see so many 
men involved and present.”

Snyder also said they 

were 
providing 
support 

for people who needed to 
debrief after the event and 
she stressed the importance 
of building relationships and 
a supporting community for 
survivors.

“I think it’s just great to 

build 
these 
relationships 

with people that you know 
are 
going 
through 
the 

same 
situation,” 
Snyder 

said. “Making it more of a 
community 
issue, 
rather 

than a women’s issue or just 
in Greek life.”

First lady Sue Snyder of 

Michigan was in attendance 
at the event, but declined an 
interview with the Daily.

At a summit on North 

Campus last October, Gov. 
Rick Snyder and Sue Snyder 
announced the continuation 
of a state grant towards 
prevention of sexual assault 
on college campuses. Last 
December, the University 
announced they received 
about $100,000 of these 
grants.

response that’s coming from 
the MARK, deans and news 
stations, but especially UM 
faculty. All of this concern!! 
That is complete crap, and let 
me tell you I am getting sick 
and tired of it.”

The email goes on to say: “All 

of this over an email?? Yet, I give 
my FACTUAL ACCOUNTS of 
two white men threatening my 
life and trying to take my car 
wearing UM hats. FACTUAL 
events, that can be seen on 2 
cameras that were in the back 
of a parking long (sic) and yet 
NO RESPONSE !!!! All of this 
solidarity, were all American 
stuff is complete BULL SHIT.”

The email also goes into 

detail 
about 
the 
alleged 

incident, where the writer 
claims on Jan. 3 at 8:15 p.m., 
she walked out from a gym 
and was “met by two pickup 
trucks,” both with white male 
drivers.

The writer described the 

white men in detail and later 
wrote what she claims the 
men said, including: “‘You’re 
not leaving tonight you whore, 
you can’t fucking park here 
you N****R.’ As I tried to ask 
him why he was so upset, he 
begin (sic) to continue the 
racial slurs shouting, ‘N****R… 
You fucking N****R can’t you 
fucking 
read?’ 
‘YOU 
ARE 

NOT 
FUCKING 
LEAVING 

TONIGHT!!!’”

The email is simply signed 

“The White Jane Doe (maybe 
the name change will help). 
#SecondofMany”

The writer acknowledged she 

called the police following the 
incident. Crime logsreleased 
by the Division of Public Safety 
and Security, however, contain 
no such report on that date, 
nor does the Ann Arbor Police 
Department crime map report 
an incident. The email did not 
detail whether the incident 
occurred 
on 
University 

property or even in Ann Arbor. 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald 
said 
DPSS 
first 

recieved an email tip on Jan. 
5, but neither DPSS nor AAPD 
recieved such a report on the 
day 
the 
incident 
allegedly 

occured. 

“DPSS 
made 
every 

reasonable effort to contact the 
sender with no succcess,” he 
said. “They could find nothing 
in our own community. Ann 
Arbor 
(police) 
could 
find 

nothing either.” 

Fitzgerald noted the only 

affiliation with the University 
detailed in the email included 
the “UM hats” worn by the 
sender’s attackers.

“People could be all around 

the world in Michigan hats,” 
he said. 

This email references the 

incidents earlier in the week, 
where three racist and anti-
Semitic emails were sent to 
the 
computer 
science 
and 

electrical engineering email 
lists.

Students 
protested 
early 

Wednesday morning outside 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s house, demanding 
action from administration. 
Later, students and faculty 
responded to Tuesday’s emails, 
calling them inexcusable. It has 
been confirmed these emails 
were “spoofed” and were not 
sent by either of the named 
senders, a University professor 
and graduate student.

The University confirmed 

it was collaborating with the 
FBI to determine the original 
sender of the spoofed emails.

Students responded to the 

email sent to the graduate 
student email list on Facebook. 
One user, Rebecca Ruby Anuru, 
a 
Public 
Health 
graduate 

student, responded in support 
of the Jane Doe email.

“Sooo 
whatever 
Black 

woman sent this email to 
UMich on mad listservs under 
the name Jane Doe (The White 
Jane Doe in the text of the 
email too, savage!), made the 
email address say ‘educated 
black student’, and shared her 
story of how UMich don’t give 
a flaming flying fuck about her 
and her safety....Thank you, sis. 
You matter.”

Fitzgerald 
took 
care 
to 

uncouple 
the 
two 
email 

incidents, 
but 
could 
not 

speculate as to the series of 
anonymous senders. 

“That’s the main question, 

and I don’t have answers” he 
said. “But one is an indivdiual 
forgery of someone on our 
campus, (and) the other is 
someone refusing to identify 
themselves (to DPSS).”

supporters.

One 
such 
speaker 
was 

Carlos 
Delgado, 
of 
the 

International 
Youth 
and 

Students for Social Equality, 
who said he was fighting for 
the rights of immigrants.

“We fight to uphold the 

principle 
of 
open 
borders 

and the rights of workers to 
live and work in whatever 
country they choose will full 
citizenship rights,” Delgado 
said. 
“We 
stand 
opposed 

to 
the 
right-wing 
attacks 

on 
immigration 
and 
the 

reactionary 
measures 
that 

are being intensified by the 
Trump 
administration 
and 

pursued by both Republicans 
and Democrats for several 
decades.”

Other speakers discussed 

how the ban was affecting 
other groups of minorities 
and cited many historical 
events they felt embodied 
some of the sentiments behind 

the immigration ban. The 
organizer referred to above 
spoke of her experiences as 
a Jewish woman and drew 
parallels between the current 
feelings toward Muslims and 
the 
feelings 
toward 
Jews 

during the World War II.

“I think a big issue with our 

community is that we need 
our voices to be heard,” the 
anonymous organizer said. “If 
you don’t speak out, your voice 
won’t be heard.”

These speeches were met 

with 
vocal 
approval 
from 

the 
crowd 
of 
more 
than 

100 
supporters 
dressed 

in 
a 
multitude 
of 
coats, 

hats, gloves and scarves to 
show their support despite 
frigid 
temperatures. 
The 

participants 
were 
sporting 

signs and banners featuring 
inspiring messages such as 
“Immigrants 
Are 
Welcome 

Here” and “No Ban, No Wall.”

Two 
attendees 
of 
the 

rally, 
LSA 
sophomore 
Ali 

Rosenblatt and Public Policy 
senior Meredith Joseph, were 
also creating a video designed 

to showcase their support for 
refugees and others affected 
by the immigration ban.

“Turning 
away 
refugees 

is detrimental, and we don’t 
want to see that happening 
again,” Rosenblatt said.

“We’re here for you, we 

stand with you,” Joseph said 
when asked what she would 
say 
to 
students 
suffering 

from the ban. “It’s all about 
standing in solidarity and 
making this community as 
welcoming as possible for 
everyone”

The University of Michigan, 

in light of the recent email 
incident 
and 
the 
current 

protest, sent a representative 
to speak on the behalf of 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel. Carol Fierke, dean 
of Rackham Graduate School 
and vice provost for Academic 
Affairs and Graduate Studies, 
discussed 
the 
University’s 

supportive stance on student 
inclusion and equality.

“Our 
overwhelming 

message 
is; 
you 
are 
all 

welcome.”

“I am deeply disappointed 

that 
Senate 
Republicans 

confirmed Betsy DeVos to lead 
the Department of Education,” 
Stabenow wrote in a press 
release. “I’ve heard from an 
overwhelming 
number 
of 

Michigan families who have 
shared their strong concerns 
about 
her 
long 
record 
of 

pushing policies that have 
seriously undermined public 
education in Michigan and 
failed our children.”

Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Mich.) 

agreed 
with 
Stabenow, 

citing DeVos’ charter school 
experiment in Michigan as 
proving her plan unfit on a 
broader 
scale. 
Additionally, 

Kildee expressed doubt that 
DeVos was confirmed based on 
merit.

“Her failed experiment in 

Michigan pushing unregulated 
and 
unaccountable 
charter 

schools has led to terrible 
results for our children, who 
will bear the greatest burden 
of today’s vote,” wrote Kildee 
in a press release. “It’s also 
no coincidence that Betsy and 
the DeVos family have donated 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 

of dollars to many of the 
Republican Senators who just 
voted to give her this job.”

Republicans defend DeVos 

as being a true conservative 
who will change the status quo, 
which they see as having failed. 

Michigan Attorney General Bill 
Schuette expressed support 
for her school of choice plans 
following her confirmation.

“For 28 years, Betsy DeVos 

has made it her mission to 
ensure 
children 
receive 
a 

quality education, and now she 
will be able to do that on a much 

larger scale,” Schuette wrote 
in a press release. “Secretary 
DeVos will be an excellent 
Secretary of Education, fixing 
our schools and at the same 
time providing children and 
families choices to find the 
school that fits their needs.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Lincoln 
Merrill, 
publicity 

chair of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, 
agreed 
with 

Schuette, 
saying 
DeVos’ 

opposition to the Common 
Core and support for school 
of choice will hopefully keep 
American students from being 
outperformed internationally.

“We are living in a time when 

the status quo is being rejected 
left and right, and the matter 
of education is no different,” 
Merrill 
said. 
“America’s 

schools are failing the nation, 
and the country needs a new 
direction with fresh leadership 
in order to improve it.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
agreed 
that 
DeVos’s 

confirmation 
must 
be 

contextualized, but said he 
worries given the financial 
aid situation of many students, 
DeVos could bring negative 
consequences to many.

“Higher education is more 

important yet more expensive 
than 
ever. 
Thousands 
of 

students here — including me 
— rely on federal support to 
come here,” Kelly said. “We 
need an education secretary 
who will find ways to increase 
funding of our schools and 
universities, not take it away. 
We don’t think Betsy DeVos is 
someone who will put students 
first, above special interests 
and partisanship.”

Merrill 
pushed 
back 

against 
claims 
that 
DeVos 

will noticeably affect higher 
education 
immediately, 

considering 
that 
school 
of 

choice policies are targeted 
toward primary and secondary 
education.

“We don’t know yet how she 

will handle the rising student 
debt crisis that has been a real 
issue over the past eight years,” 
Merrill said. “One thing that 
may happen is regulations 
for 
universities 
will 
likely 

be 
scaled 
back, 
allowing 

universities to save costs by 
hiring fewer faculty and staff.”

“It’s a loving and inclusive 

environment,” she said. “You 
wouldn’t think a protest to be 
like that, but it’s comforting 
that there’s a lot of people here, 
and that there are so many 
different people coming out to 
support this cause. Everybody 
has a different background, 
everybody is from a different 
place, but we are all American.”

Students4Justice 
is 
a 

relatively new student group 
that aims to expose inequities 
on campus. The organizers 
encouraged 
attendees 
to 

bring homework, water, food, 
prayer rugs and posters to 
demonstrate their resolve.

In 
addition 
to 
acting 

in response to the recent 
bias 
incidents 
on 
campus, 

Students4Justice also asked for 
their voices to be heard by the 
administration. A driving force 
behind the event was that the 
organizers felt a lack of action 
from the administration.

Public 
Health 
student 

Vikrant Garg, a core member 
of Students4Justice, said he 
wants the administration to 

take a stand and do something.

“We 
need 
(University 

President Mark) Schlissel to 
actually be present,” Garg 
said. “We need him to make 
actionable change if he wants 
us to feel welcome on this 
campus.”

LSA senior David Schafer, 

president of Central Student 
Government, said he found 
the solidarity of the students 
to be important in facilitating 
change.

“I just think this event is 

powerful 
and 
important,” 

Schafer said. “It’s my hope 
that real and lasting tangible 

change comes from this. I 
know those are buzzwords 
and buzz-phrases, but it’s the 
only way anything has ever 
been done at this school. It 
stems from the bottom up; it’s 
students who are tired of being 
tired and having their voices 
heard, ensuring a more just 
and equitable community is 
made possible.”

The protest drew a diverse 

group of students as the sit-in 
carried on through the night. 
The students in attendance 
were there for various reasons, 
including 
political 
and 

religious ones.

LSA 
freshman 
Tiana 

Brandon said she marched 
because she felt her identity 
was threatened by the current 
atmosphere on campus.

“It’s 
always 
important 

to fight for what is right,” 
Brandon 
said. 
“In 
this 

particular situation it applies 
to me. As a woman of color, I 
have to fight for my life, and 
I don’t think people realize 
the seriousness of the matter. 
If I can’t feel safe on campus, 
how am I — a minority student 
— 
being 
welcomed 
here? 

Schlissel’s approach to this is 
not okay.”

“I am also a minority, so I 

wanted to come see what the 
perspective was and wanted to 
see what their perspective was 
from a male student athlete 
because I was a student athlete 
as well,” Penebaker said. “I 
wanted to see where (Jackson, 
Edwards 
and 
King) 
were 

coming from in their time and 
how things have changed.”

LSA 
senior 
Braylon 

Edwards, who returned to 
the University this semester 
to finish his degree, followed 
Ways. Edwards touched on the 
influence of the media and the 
disparity between the ways 
white athletes are praised as 
opposed to Black athletes.

“They do the same thing 

with 
Russell 
Wilson 
and 

Aaron 
Rodgers,” 
Edwards 

said. “They say Aaron Rodgers 
is mentally insane. They say 
the way he is able to predict 
lineman 
coming 
in, 
steps 

outside, gets around and when 
he throws passes, his laser 
sharp 
accuracy, 
pin-point, 

mental 
toughness. 
When 

(Russell 
Wilson) 
does 
the 

same thing, his athletic ability 
allows him … to get the ball 
down there.”

Edwards continued talking 

about the experiences of Black 
student athletes with their 
academics, including the skills 
Black male athletes lack when 
they come to the University 
and how expectations put on 
their athletics can detract 

from their academics.

“Many Black athletes come 

to campus with poor academic 
preparation,” Edwards said. 
“(Jabrill Peppers) is no longer 
the student athlete, he’s the 
athlete … the pressure that 
comes with that, no one sees.”

Business junior Nate Fisher 

said the viewpoints of the 
athletes at the event were 
ones he hasn’t been exposed to 
before.

“I definitely was able to see 

the viewpoints that a lot of the 
Black athletes are bringing up, 
recognizing how in our society 
they are usually perceived in 
a certain way,” Fischer said. 
“It was really cool for me, as 
a white person, to take in this 
point of view to really have a 
more holistic view of different 
perspectives of different types 
of athletes.”

Feb. 9 marked the 25th 

anniversary of when the Fab 
Five first started together. The 
Fab Five have been regarded 
as a cultural phenomenon, 
reaching the 1992 and 1993 
NCAA 
Division 
I 
Men’s 

Basketball 
Championship 

games.

Ray Jackson, the keynote 

speaker and a member of the 
Fab Five, highlighted his time 
as an athlete and what he has 
learned since then. Jackson 
emphasized 
his 
experience 

when he started his first game 
against Notre Dame on this 
day 25 years ago with the other 
members of the Fab Five.

“From that day forward, I 

never thought about school on 
the same level as I did prior to 

that,” Jackson said. “Before 
that day, I was making it to 
class all the time.”

Jackson introduced another 

member of the Fab Five, 
Jimmy King, to shed light 
on his experiences as well, 
including 
the 
pressure 
on 

athletes and being exploited 
as a member of the Fab Five.

“You don’t want to let your 

community down,” King said. 
“You have all this weight on 
your shoulders … that pressure 
can break you.”

King also spoke about being 

exploited, 
including 
when 

Nike came to the Fab Five 
with five duffel bags full of 
gear, telling them they could 
have whatever they wanted. 
King and the other members 
of the Fab Five realized what 
was going on.

“We’re 
basically 
unpaid 

consultants,” 
King 
said. 

“Whatever we pick is what 
they’re going to sell and make 
money on. (Nike) would rather 
talk about anything else but 
that. As soon as (the coach) 
mentioned compensation, they 
pushed away from the table, 
got up and left and didn’t say 
a word.”

Jackson finished the night 

describing the Black male 
athlete and solutions to the 
issues posed throughout the 
night.

“If we don’t educate our 

kids and our children coming 
up, we will continue to have 
athletes go broke, commit 
suicide, beat their girlfriends,” 
Jackson said. “That stems 
from lack of education.”

ATHLETES

M

y 
parents 
came 

from China to the 
United 
States 
in 

1991, penniless but 
filled with hope. 
They 
had 
faith 

that this new land 
held 
promises 

of 
a 
brighter 

future; they had 
to, 
otherwise 

uprooting 
themselves 
from 

everything 
they 

had ever known 
would be all for 
naught. 
Coming 

here was a gamble, and they 
were all in. 

The 1965 Immigration Act, 

which eradicated immigration 
quotas, led to a large influx 
of 
immigrants 
from 
Asian 

countries. 
For 
my 
parents 

and many other Asians who 
immigrated to the U.S. in the 
late twentieth century, their 
sacrifices 
paid 
off. 
While 

juggling a new baby (my older 
sister, age one) and late-night 
jobs 
in 
dishwashing 
and 

hosting, my father earned his 
doctorate and my mother, her 
master’s. They found 
jobs, 

worked hard, kept their heads 
down and earned a spot in the 
United States’ upper-middle 
class. It’s the classic Asian 
immigrant success story, and 
it’s this trajectory that has 
earned Asians the title of the 
“model minority.”

The title may seem like a 

compliment, but upon further 
inspection, the implications 
are troubling. Why are Asians 
seen as the model minority? 
Is it because they work hard 
and frequently achieve the 
American Dream? Or, is it 
because we stay relatively quiet 
about social issues and do not 
often speak up about injustices 
we face?

Although we may be a model 

minority now, the last century 
was 
rife 
with 
anti-Asian 

sentiment, 
and 
we 

cannot let our present 
relative fortune make 
us think that we have 
nothing in common 
with 
the 
many 

Muslims barred from 
entering or reentering 
the 
United 
States. 

From 1917, with the 
Asiatic Barred Zone 
Act, to roughly 1943, 
with the repeal of the 
Chinese 
Exclusion 

Act, Asian Americans were the 
targets of immigration laws. 
We must not forget that, at one 
point, 70 percent of immigrants 
detained and interrogated on 
Angel Island were Chinese.

The news would have you 

think the United States is 
black and white, but in truth, 
Asians still face racism and 
bias in the U.S., sometimes 
blatantly 
and 
on 
national 

television, such as Chris Rock’s 
exploitation of three Asian 
children for a racist joke at 
last year’s Academy Awards. 
However, these offenses do 
not receive as much media 
attention or spark movements, 
partly because there is a lack 
of Asian Americans in politics 
and media to bring awareness 
to the issues, but also because 
Asian 
Americans 
have 
a 

tendency to avoid “stirring the 
pot” or being politically active.

There are a few prominent 

public figures who give a voice 
to Asian Americans in the 
media — Constance Wu, who 
has 
no 
problem 
criticizing 

Hollywood on its white-savior 
casting of Matt Damon in “The 
Great Wall,” comes to mind 
— but they are still a minority 
within 
a 
minority. 
More 

commonly, 
Asian 
Americans 

are comfortable as the United 
States’ model minority. Why risk 
the role over a few grievances?

As a result, many Asian 

Americans feel distant from the 
issues that other immigrants 
and minority groups face in 
U.S. However, this mindset 
has to change. As we enter 
Donald 
Trump’s 
presidency, 

which has already imposed a 
travel ban on seven Muslim-
majority countries and signed 
an executive order to begin 
construction on a wall between 
the U.S. and Mexico, it is more 
important than ever for Asian 
Americans to stand in solidarity 
with 
the 
new 
president’s 

targeted groups.

Now is not the time to be 

bystanders, 
because 
although 

Trump’s 
policies 
may 
not 

targeting 
Asian 
Americans 

specifically, they are targeting 
an immigrant minority, and we 
are not strangers to that. We can 
no longer stay quiet and pretend 
these issues do not affect us. 
We can no longer turn the other 
cheek under the guise of not 
being “political.”

President Trump will not 

reward us for being model 
anything. If he is waging a 
war on immigration, it would 
be naive to believe that Asian 
Americans are exempt from it. 
After all, he has already shown 
his dislike for Chinese and 
Japanese businessmen during 
his election campaign with a 
grossly 
racist 
impersonation. 
 

Asian Americans may not be 
Trump’s primary target right 
now, but that doesn’t mean we 
can’t be, won’t be or weren’t.

We 
must 
remember 
that, 

besides those truly native to 
America, we are all immigrants 
here. And we must stand together.

I

t 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 

Republican 
Party 

currently 
maintains 

a higher position of power 
in the government because 
of the election of a new 
president. 
However, 
with 

many 
unqualified 
people 

being selected for important 
positions, a real question is 
posed: Is the Republican Party 
being convinced to follow its 
members 
without 
assessing 

how successful the candidates 
will be? 

On Tuesday, Betsy DeVos 

was confirmed as the secretary 
of 
education 
despite 
her 

worrisome background with 
education. As Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren 
(D–Mass.) 
said 
in 

DeVos’ confirmation hearing 
in 
January, 
“the 
financial 

futures of an entire generation 
of young people depends on 
(her) department getting (its 
job) right.”

Supporters of DeVos mention 

that they want control over 
schools to go back to states and 
communities. This could even 
allow for religious control over 
schools. This does not ensure 
that everyone will receive the 
same education, because it will 
cause standards to vary and 
be inconsistent, which will 
further divide our country. It is 
also essential that her followers 
realize that not everyone is 
a follower of her beliefs but 
that they should still receive 
equal and non-discriminatory 
education. Now that she has 
been confirmed, the quality 
of our public education could 
decrease, affecting at least 50.4 
million public K-12 students 
and ultimately moving our 
society backward. 

There is minimal evidence 

for why Republicans voted yes 
on DeVos for everyone’s best 
interests, not just their own. 
Only two voted against her. 

Her visions do not have 

the best interests of any of 
us at heart. Proper education 
should not be a privilege, 
because with it, we are a better 
society. It seems as though the 
Republican Party does not care 
about education — the priority 

for its members seems to be 
money. DeVos has personally 
donated 
about 
$115,000 
to 

Republican 
senators 
prior 

to her confirmation, and her 
foundation contributed $1.45 
million to the party and to 
candidates who lobbied for a 
Detroit Public Schools plan 
that ultimately would cause 
the poorly performing public 
schools to close, but not the 
bad charter schools. She has 
been blamed for destroying 
the 
public 
school 
system 

in 
Michigan, 
especially 
in 

Detroit. Our state’s education 
ranking has fallen over the 
years and is predicted to fall 
further by 2030.

An 
exchange 
between 

Warren and DeVos affirms 
she has little to no idea about 
how 
financial 
aid 
works. 

Since she is someone of higher 
socioeconomic 
status, 
she 

cannot fully understand how 
money is a limiting factor for 
people of lower socioeconomic 
statuses in pursuing education. 
It’s hard to forget that she 
has not attended, worked in 
or sent her children to public 
schools. The way students will 
be treated will be affected 
because of her views. She 
cannot identify with many of 
us, and her actions will only 
benefit the families who can 
afford to send their children 
to private school because her 
policies will have little to no 
effect on them.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) 

also questioned her during her 
confirmation hearing, asking, 
“Do you think if you were not 
a 
multi-billionaire, 
if 
your 

family has not made hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
dollars 
of 

contributions to the Republican 
party, that you would be sitting 
here 
today?” 
Her 
rebuttal 

mentioned that she worked 
with low-income students, yet 
she has not even glanced at 
the under-funded schools in 
Detroit. Her “donated” money 
ultimately went into buying 
herself a spot in President 
Donald Trump’s Cabinet.

She claims that every student 

should have access to high-

quality options for education, 
but she would not agree to work 
with Sanders to make public 
colleges free.

Even for moral issues, she 

could not explicitly say she 
supports that every taxpayer-
funded K-12 school be required 
to meet the requirements of the 
Individuals with Disabilities 
Care Act. Instead, she believes 
it should be up to states, which 
means she does not believe that 
the existing law that protects 
disabled students should be 
enforced. Sen. Tim Kaine (D–
Va.) simply states why this is 
problematic: “Some states might 
be good to kids with disabilities 
and other states not so good and, 
what then, people could just 
move around the country if they 
don’t like how kids are being 
treated?” She had the same 
solution on schools reporting 
discipline, 
harassment 
and 

bullying: leave it up to the state. 
If she does not want to enforce 
a 
safe 
school 
environment 

for all children, how can the 
Republicans who voted for her 
identify with her and support 
her choices?

Her actions hit even closer 

to home for many college 
students, namely because she 
could not commit to preserving 
Title IX guidance, passed to 
prevent gender discrimination 
and protect sexual violence 
survivors 
and 
act 
against 

sexual assault by investigating 
immediately, 
which 
Trump 

wants to repeal. Her donations 
include thousands of dollars to 
the Foundation for Individual 
Rights in Education, a group 
that 
has 
fought 
legislation 

aimed 
to 
prevent 
campus 

sexual assault.

DeVos 
threatens 
schools 

not only in an ideological 
sense but also because of her 
inexperience 
and 
financial 

support of groups that are 
working 
against 
creating 

equality for all. Every student 
should be able to access public 
education 
without 
partisan 

politics muddling its quality.

Talking points of democracy

ROLAND DAVIDSON | COLUMN

L

ast month, after Rep. 
John 
Lewis 
(D–Ga.), 

a civil rights leader, 

declared 
that 
he 

considers 
President 

Donald 
Trump 

an 
illegitimate 

president, 
Trump 

responded 
in 
a 

series 
of 
tweets: 

“Congressman John 
Lewis should spend 
more time on fixing 
and 
helping 
his 

district, which is in 
horrible shape and 
falling 
apart 
(not 

to……mention crime infested) 
rather than falsely complaining 
about 
the 
election 
results. 

All talk, talk, talk - no action 
or results. Sad!” The liberal 
response to Trump’s attack 
was 
to 
juxtapose 
Lewis’s 

record of activism during the 
60s 
and 
Trump’s 
multiple 

military deferments and lavish 
upbringing.

There are a number of ways 

to explain why liberals would 
follow this line of argument. 
An uncharitable reading is 
that it makes them feel good 
but is ultimately ineffective. 
Democrats 
get 
to 
remind 

themselves that they’re the 
heirs 
to 
civil-rights-era 

activism and to that era’s 
successes. This interpretation 
also 
fits 
into 
both 
the 

narratives that Trump is a 
hypocrite and that, despite his 
outsider status, Trump grew 
up in the lap of luxury.

However, is this reading 

meaningfully 
rebutting 

Trump’s 
argument? 
If 
you 

read his initial tweet, he’s 
criticizing Lewis’s work as a 
congressman, not as an activist. 
The uncharitable reading is 
not doing much to actively 
dispel Trump’s narrative, and 
it’s 
primarily 
consolidating 

liberals’ position.

This reading is pretty easy 

to criticize. There’s a sort 

of 
intellectual 
hollowness 

in talking past one another. 
At 
its 
best, 
democracy 
is 

a 
high-minded 

battle 
of 
ideas. 

But 
our 
political 

discussions 
rarely 

reflect this. Liberals 
and 
conservatives 

are talking past one 
another.

The exact same 

thing happens with 
our nation’s debate 
on 
abortion: 
One 

side is concerned 
with the morality 

of denying a potential person’s 
existence, while the other cares 
about placing an undue burden 
on the mother. Embedded deep 
within our ideals of political 
engagement is the idea of a 
Hegelian synthesis, wherein 
each side debates one another 
and 
proposes 
their 
theses. 

Ultimately, both sides come 
out with a new understanding, 
an intellectual synthesis, with 
both sides being bettered. In 
reality, debaters just keep going 
back and forth endlessly.

But the United States is not 

functioning anywhere close 
to those vague democratic 
ideals. 
It’s 
important 
that 

no democracy truly be at 
that level. Realistically, it’s 
impossible to expect every 
American 
to 
substantively 

understand every angle of an 
issue and then substantively 
evaluate the pros and cons of 
each side. Once we’ve accepted 
that, we can understand the 
political value these sorts of 
arguments have. Controlling 
the way that a story is told 
allows you to guide the ensuing 
conversation and help people 
on the fence or shift the timbre 
of conversation.

This makes logical sense, 

but it’s also been empirically 
proven to be the case. A 1997 
study showed participants two 
news stories about a planned 

Ku Klux Klan march. The first 
framed the issue as one of 
freedom of speech: Should the 
KKK be allowed to march? The 
second framed portrayed the 
discussion as circling around 
civic order: Would the KKK’s 
march threaten people’s lives?

Predictably, when the march 

went through the first frame, 
people were more tolerant of 
the KKK’s speeches by about 
30 percentage points and more 
supportive of the march by 
about 20 points. The opposite 
happened when people were 
exposed to the public safety 
frame. Interestingly, studies 
have 
shown 
that 
framing 

effects 
are 
most 
powerful 

among better students and 
more educated people, so it’s 
not as though this strategy is a 
way to shape the masses.

Even though it’s not the 

most intellectually glamorous 
rhetorical strategy, changing 
frames has been shown to be 
very effective. But there are 
going to be people who are 
resistant to these different 
frames. Framing effects can 
be effective for people without 
strong views on a topic, but 
don’t be surprised when these 
arguments fail to move the 
needle much.

Additionally, 
a 
key 

moderating factor for a group’s 
ability to control the frame 
is not only about the relative 
merit of the frame, but also 
about 
how 
loud 
they 
are. 

Trump is incredibly effective 
at communicating his messages 
to millions of people, which 
may limit the power of these 
framing 
effects. 
Thus, 
to 

effectively 
combat 
Trump’s 

frames, liberals need to step 
away 
from 
liberal 
talking 

points and think about moral 
arguments in order to actually 
address his arguments head on.

One of the things I’ve always 

liked about folk music is its 
capacity for energy. The vari-
ety of different instruments 
encourages a nuanced sound 
that always amazes me. It isn’t 
hard to see why people con-
nect with the sound so much, 
whether they’re hearing it 
through their headphones or in 
the moment at a live show.

Few 
modern 
folk 
bands 

exemplify this energy with 
quite the same fervor as Moun-
tain Heart. A bluegrass and 
soul-influenced 
band 
from 

Nashville, 
Mountain 
Heart 

doesn’t shy away from the con-
nectable energy that comes 
out of folk music. Depending 
on the song, the 
band 
will 
amp 

up the genre to 
a new level of 
intensity, dial it 
back to allow for 
heavier moments 
or maneuver it 
into creative and 
genre-bending 
new territory.

“Other genres can be com-

partmentalized, if that’s the 
right word,” said lead singer 
Josh Shilling in an interview 
with the Daily. “You have to 
be a certain age, look a certain 
way.” With folk and Ameri-
cana, 
though, 
“artists 
are 

allowed to be themselves.”

“Your fan base will age with 

you, and allow you to age,” 
Shilling said.

In this way Americana is 

resistant to the idea of a musi-
cal “shelf life,” finding its 
appeal more in a “grassroots 
following that doesn’t have 
anything to do with the radio 
… it’s not a pop culture thing, 
it’s a thing that people connect 
to for life.”

This 
type 
of 
flexibil-

ity allows for a lot of artistic 
exploration, 
and 
Mountain 

Heart takes full advantage 
of this, doing a good job of 
not pigeonholing itself into 
one genre. Shilling person-
ally sings “more soulful stuff,” 
even though he was “born into 
bluegrass” near the Blue Ridge 
Mountains area of Virginia. 
The other band members were 
“initially huge into bluegrass,” 
Shilling said. “Molly (Cherry-
holmes) … grew up in a band, 
basically lived on a tour bus, 
playing with her family band 
called 
The 
Cherryholmes. 

She’s kind of been around the 
bluegrass world her entire life, 
since birth … but loves soul 
music.”

Shilling went on to explain 

how Aaron Ramsey, a more tra-
ditional bluegrass singer, sang 
“Maggie’s Farm,” a Bob Dylan 
cover included on their new 

album.

“Jeff, our bass player, also 

sings incredibly well,” Shilling 
said, “and everybody onstage 
switches instruments, too. On 
our albums, literally, there will 
be banjo, and then there will 
be Hammond B-3 organ, and 
then there’s an accordion and 
piano, mixed with mandolin 
and fiddle. So it’s very eclectic 
and unusual in that regard.”

All in all, the musicians of 

Mountain Heart are influ-
enced by artists as diverse as 
Tony Rice, Ricky Skaggs, Ali-
son Krauss, Darryl Scott and 
The Allman Brothers.

“We really just try to do 

what we love,” Shilling said.

This variety in musical taste 

comes together as a fusion of 
something new in the band’s 
music, and it can also lead 
them into unexpected terri-

tory 
in 
terms 

of 
songwriting. 

Shilling recount-
ed a recent expe-
rience in which 
the entire band 
worked 
togeth-

er 
to 
write 
a 

song, which he 
describes 
as 
a 

“Crosby-Stills-Nash 
throw-

back.”

“You have to wade through 

four or five opinions, and four 
or five brains like mine that 
never stop,” Shilling said, but 
ultimately the band came up 
with a new song called “Rest-
less Wind.”

“I would’ve never gotten 

such a beautiful piece of music 
on my own,” Shilling said.

Their new 2016 album, Blue 

Skies, was written with the 
idea of playing it live in mind.

“We tried to record things 

that could be a set list,” Shilling 
said, referencing songs from 
the album like “Miss Me When 
I’m Gone,” “Have You Heard 
About the Old Hometown” and 
the titular track, “Blue Skies.” 
He hinted that the band will 
play many of these songs this 
weekend when they perform 
live at The Ark, on Saturday.

Just as the songs from Blue 

Skies lend themselves to live 
performances, so, in a way, 
does venue of The Ark. Shil-
ling is excited to get back to 
the notable folk venue, where 
Mountain Heart has played 
several 
times 
before, 
and 

where, he said, there is a “type 
of accessible energy” that isn’t 
often found outside of festival 
environments.

“The crowd is not just sub-

dued, they’re wide open,” Shil-
ling said. “It’s very exciting for 
us, to be in a venue where peo-
ple are so electric like that.”

Part of this might come from 

The Ark’s location far north of 
bluegrass’s origins.

“In 
the 
southeast, 
for 

instance,” Shilling said, “blue-
grass music, and folk music, 

and acoustic music, are every-
where, and it’s really, really 
saturated … but it’s a little 
different from when you’re in 
New York City, or when you’re 
in Minneapolis or when you’re 
in Ann Arbor. Those people 
just absolutely love it. It almost 
seems like they need it, you 
know, or maybe they don’t get 
that kind of music often. I real-
ly feel like the support we get is 
just amazing in that part of the 
country (the North).”

Mountain Heart also shares 

a unique tie with The Ark in 
that they recorded an entire 
live album there, The Road that 
Never Ends, in 2007.

“That process was amazing, 

because we played for like four 
hours,” Shilling said. “We’d 
play, you know, for thirty min-
utes, and then mess something 
up. So we’d stop the song and 
tell the audience what hap-
pened, and then start the song 
over, because we were record-
ing it!”

He explained how that 4 

hour-long show was edited to 
become The Road that Never 
Ends, and added: “We’d actu-
ally love to record again there.”

Knowing the band’s history 

with The Ark, it is no surprise 
that they are excited to come 
back this weekend.

“At The Ark, you see people 

who really, really get it, who 
really support it,” Shilling said. 
“We have friends who come 
from all over there … it’s just 
really special, it’s kind of like a 
family reunion.”

This 
will 
be 
Mountain 

Heart’s first time at The Ark 
“with the project in hand,” 
meaning their new album. 
They will be selling copies of 
Blue Skies, as well as newly 
designed Mountain Heart tee 
shirts. This show is “one of 
the highlights of (the band’s) 
year,” according to Shilling, 
and it will be followed by many 
more exciting venues: Later 
this year, they plan to perform 
in Roanoke, Virginia (near 
where Shilling grew up), and in 
Flagstaff, Arizona, as well as at 
the world-famous MerleFest in 
North Carolina.

If Blue Skies is any indica-

tion of what the audience can 
expect this Saturday, it will be 
a show full of layered emotion 
and energy. The connection 
that people feel with music 
through songwriting and live 
performances is “kind of the 
reason we all didn’t decide 
to put on a suit and tie and go 
get a desk job,” Shilling said. 
This commitment to the power 
of music is not unfamiliar to 
Mountain Heart, nor, it seems, 
to anyone who has seen them 
live in the past, whether at The 
Ark or elsewhere.

With the power of live 

music, “you get to make peo-
ple happy, even if it’s just for a 
short time,” Shilling said.

HBO

In season finale, ‘The Young Pope’ 
meditates as much as it vindicates 

“The Young Pope” makes it 

a point to leave you reeling. It’s 
obnoxious and inflammatory, 
but miraculous-
ly avoids being 
unseemly. For a 
show that finds 
pleasure in con-
stantly 
poking 

and prodding its 
viewers, its shelf 
life manages to 
surprise. Whether Lenny Belar-
do (Jude Law, “Spy”) is buried 
deep in his childhood melodra-
ma, or viciously — and laudably 
— politicking his way around 
Vatican City, the mask he dons as 
Pope Pius XIII never fails to con-
found, confuse, excite and ter-
rorize — oftentimes all at once.

In “The Young Pope,” cre-

ator, writer and director Paolo 
Sorrentino (“Youth”) crafts a 
thematic paradox. He manages 
to desecrate the tenets and tra-
ditions of the Catholic Church 
without impunity, while ear-
nestly glorifying its propriety 
and affection in the same breath. 
His thematic intentions with 
regards to the Church remain 
largely unclear, even as the dust 
settles around the finale — but 
ruminating over that is an exer-
cise in futility. While HBO can 
bill the show as pertaining to the 
Catholic Church all they want, 
Sorrentino makes it no mystery 
that the Church is but a carefully 
curated backdrop for a story far 
larger than the already portly 
institution. 
Sorrentino’s 
sto-

ries are grand, and his visions 
behoove and arrest — but most 
importantly, they’re befitting for 
the kind of narratives he so des-
perately seeks to operate on.

Pope Pius XIII introduces 

himself to us as a hawk who 
lurches from the shadows. He 
is a false promise sold by the 
Church to itself and, ultimately, 
a metaphor for the inevitable 
impropriety and shortsighted-
ness that centuries of killing 

time ushers in. His emotions and 
actions often recall to life the 
demeanor of Francis Ford Cop-
pola’s take on Michael Corleone 
(Al Pacino, “Misconduct”) — a 
kind of demeanor that led Cor-
leone to usurp his father and sib-
lings in regards to their cunning 

and penchant for 
grandeur (the Pope 
unfolding 
to 
his 

own 
“family” 
in 

much of the same 
manner). He reviles 
homosexuality, 
demonizes abortion 
and ham-handedly 

makes enemies and skeptics out 
of would-be peers — all while the 
Church was expecting an ear-
nest ambassador for their intend-
ed institutional liberalization. 
The world around him erupts in 
protest, and Sorrentino advanta-
geously channels that fervor into 
the kind of striking cinematogra-
phy that nurtures the program’s 
absurdity — an image of FEMEN 
protesters bloodily painted with 
the 
word 
“bastard” 
littered 

around the Papal Palace’s garden 
isn’t a scene to forget.

But 
Sorrentino 
carefully 

guides the program’s narrative 
in such a way as to highlight the 
nuances of time and progress. 
The Pope comes to us as a com-
plex man, in strong pursuit of a 
gripping and enigmatic legacy, 
and for a sense of long-craved 
familial affirmation. He first 
goes about fulfilling his desires 
in ways that stun and polarize 
his colleagues. Attempts to stain 
the Pope in scandal drip from 
the upper rungs of the Church, 
and St. Peter’s Square becomes a 
jarringly empty enclave. Drunk 
on power, Pius — in the name 
of his ego — becomes unknow-
ingly hell-bent on becoming 
the Church’s undoing. But the 
Pope’s self-orchestrated chaos 
transforms itself into a pertinent 
meditation, most evident in the 
finale.

Pius begins the program in 

the shadow of his more funda-
mental predecessors as a means 
to strike fear into the hearts of 
those around him, but those 

intentions slowly become more 
telling of a wounded man on a 
lifelong search for personal equi-
librium. As much as he casts his 
fists in violent deference, Pius is 
also man who suffers. He shields 
his face from public view to 
cloud himself in manufactured 
enigma, but one can’t help but 
ask if his unabashed, impulsive 
authority is just one grand cop-
ing mechanism for a man far 
more emotionally wrought than 
he’s proud to admit. His pro-
digious self-awareness finally 
becomes of use as he reconciles 
with the wounds of abandon-
ment that have marred him for so 
long — and with that reconcilia-
tion comes a leader and savior far 
more fit for the papal regalia than 
anyone could have expected.

The program relishes its last 

minutes, with the Pope finally 
revealing himself to a massive 
crowd in Venice’s St. Mark’s 
Square. After months of chas-
tising and berating the public 
from afar, Pius delivers a sober-
ing address that contradicts 
his otherwise taut predilec-
tion for authority and mystery. 
Drawing on the stories of the 
canonized (but, unfortunately, 
fictitious) Juana Fernandez — a 
Guatemalan teenager touted for 
her saintly love and affection 
— Pius addresses the crowd on 
the oft-misunderstood simplic-
ity of devotion. He implores the 
crowd to smile. In rare form, he 
smiles. And he cries. An address 
meant to be a prescient reminder 
for believers and nonbelievers 
alike becomes symbolic of a per-
sonal vindication that may have 
never been in the cards for Pius. 
The Pope collapses after a final 
earnest smile. Papal infallibil-
ity mightily held in one hand, 
personal tumult in the other, 
Pope Pius XIII’s frequent shifts 
between ruler and child shows 
that even in the glory of a mani-
cured image and regimented 
rule, the human soul wounds, 
nurtures and persists.

For many, Odd Future (née 

Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill 
Them 
All, 
or 

OFWGKTA) was 
some of our most 
formative 
lis-

tening — “Yon-
kers,” in all of 
Tyler, The Cre-
ator’s large bug-eating, vomit-
inducing, “threesomes with a 
triceratops”-claiming 
glory, 

was that video, the one we 
watched 
with 
our 
friends 

while feasting on our new-
est convenience store candy 
acquisitions, probably while 
playing Call of Duty, angsty 
and rebellious for no good 
reason. Like it or not, Syd will 
forever be inextricably linked 
to this group and its look. She 
was Syd tha Kid when she was 
part of this brand, a key cog in 
an iconic collective that still 
sees the effects of its cultural 
explosion reverberate around 
the rap industry.

This is fitting, however, 

because this machine, and its 
individual parts, function(ed) 
on disregard. This is Syd, and 
this is her Fin (whatever that 
Fin is). It’s the end of some-
thing, maybe her Odd Future 
life, maybe the beginning of 
some end, or maybe specula-

tion is futile, because this is 
her proverbial badassness, pro-
jected.

It’s there on “Shake Em Off,” 

to start. What could erroneous-
ly be interpreted as an explicit 
middle finger actually — with 

conviction — con-
veys uncertainty, 
over 
deliberate 

and luscious pro-
duction. Immedi-
ately, her current 
state 
of 
being 

is taken in the context of her 
past. While this is undoubted-
ly closer to what she did with 
Matt Martians as The Internet, 
it strays, definitively, from the 
Odd Future vibe. This sound 
is simultaneously foreign and 
welcome.

Gradually Syd builds an 

imposing version of herself, a 
silent assassin-esque power. 
“All About Me” flexes via a 
paced, pulsing beat. Here is 
Syd’s foremost proclamation 
of success. In what ultimately 
amounts to an appropriate 
boast, the singer reorients the 
listener’s attention to where it 
should be — her.

“Smile 
More” 
shifts 
in 

tempo, and it essentially flares 
just right. The album’s most 
overtly sexual track slow jams 
its way through levels of inti-
macy en route to “Got Her 
Own,” a more unabashedly 
cocky victory lap (“Know you 
seen her in the magazines, 

your / Aunty might hate, but 
it’s flattering, girl”).

It’s all fun, certainly, but 

Fin would do better with 
more variation and depth; the 
instrumentals become repeti-
tive and too often the very 
ethereality of the production 
masks shallow lyrical content. 
Alas, it thrives in its quiet con-
fidence. There’s no Los Ange-
les hip-hop here, no Funky 
Bass or Prominent Drum, no 
Y.G.-esque 
thump-de-bump 

and certainly no Tyler fuck-
around-ing. Syd strays, and 
appropriately so.

“Dollar 
Bills” 
surprises 

with 
tropical 
guitar 
from 

Steve Lacy in addition to his 
own fun verse. What comes 
off as a surface-level shtick 
might, indeed, be a surface-
level shtick, but the majority of 
the release is melodic beauty; 
even on “Over,” which exhib-
its a more melancholic grace, 
there’s an atmospheric quality 
(this time bolstered by a prod-
ding 6LACK feature) that fun-
damentally cements the album 
as her own, unique thing.

Perhaps 
Syd 
never 
fully 

identified with that potential-
ly too-enveloping OFWGKTA 
brand. Perhaps she did, and is 
now more comfortable than 
ever with moving on from it. 
This, Fin, is a start, an unapol-
ogetic pronouncement of Syd, 
by Syd. Hopefully there’s more 
where it came from.

TV NOTEBOOK

The TV show intro — the 

magic moments before your 
beloved program begins. The 
show’s 30 minute arc induc-
es a strong emotional pull in 
you. Some skeptics consider 
the intro a lost art form, pal-
ing in importance to mighty 
primetime programming, and 
for others, it’s a disgrace to 
the holy ritual of watching 
their favorite show. But for me, 
these small vignettes of video 
and sound flow through my 
veins, pump blood through my 
organic vessels and bring me to 
life. This is my open love letter 
to the art of the theme song, 
the cast credits; the anticipa-
tion before the show begins.

Some may call me crazy, a 

lovestruck fool or a hopeless 
romantic, enamored with the 
sound and light waves travel-
ing from the screen to my con-
sciousness. But these feelings 
are legitimate, real and stron-
ger than ever. For me, the TV 
show intro is an amazing work 
of art and doesn’t get the rec-
ognition it deserves.

Intros (back in the glory 

days of television) united us 
as Americans. It’s impossible 
to remember every episode 
of “Friends,” every intricate 
moment of “Gilmore Girls” 
or every joke made on “Fresh 
Prince 
of 
Bel-Air.” 
Those 

hilarious quips or iconic scenes 
have fallen by the wayside in 
the banks of our memory. But 
I bet anyone who has reli-
giously watched these shows 
can recite their theme songs 
by heart. I bet they get up off 

of the couch and groove to the 
tunes which radiate from the 
television and into their soul. 
These were the pop songs of 
our 
youth, 
the 
connecting 

threads of our young hearts, 
bridging cultural gaps and cre-
ating beautiful friendships in 
the process. 

Not only do the theme songs 

of TV shows make them great, 
but their ability to tell a story 
in such a short amount of time 
elevate them magnificently. 
Look at “Friends,” for exam-
ple. Immediately, it’s obvious 
that this show is about friends 
goofing off together and doing 
silly things; it’s amazing that 
so much is conveyed in such 
a short time. Or in the show 
“Adventure Time,” the first 15 
seconds takes the viewer on a 
whirlwind journey of whimsi-
cal fun, showing them that the 
theme song is all they need to 
see in order to grab their atten-
tion. It’s genius and it’s show-
stopping — it’s the magical art 
of the intro at work.

Any 
reader 
might 
ques-

tion my logic. “There are ter-
rible intros in the world,” 
non-believers shout at me. 
“TV intros are annoying and 
unnecessary,” 
heretics 
say. 

Yes, I know that there are bad 
eggs in the bunch.

Not everything is perfect; no 

relationship is what it seems on 
the surface. There are ups and 
downs that go on behind the 
scenes, and the intro and I are 
no exception. We have had our 
spats over things like why the 
intro to “Modern Family” was 
so lackluster or why “Strang-
er Things” was such a good 
show, despite the intro being 
just slowly zooming text. Like 
any normal love story, there 

are bumps in the road, but we 
are able to move past them by 
working a little bit harder and 
focusing on the good times.

And there have been many 

good times. TV show intros 
have made me the man I am 
today. They have stuck with 
me throughout my life and 
they are the one constant that 
I can always count on. When I 
was five years old, I was beam-
ing with happiness whenever 
the “Dora the Explorer” song 
came on.

At ten years old, I was giddi-

ly singing along to “Spongebob 
Squarepants” while munching 
on my cereal in the morning. 
At 15, I discussed the beauti-
ful simplicity of the “Parks and 
Rec” intro with my friends. 
And now I’m 20, and I’m dis-
secting the intricate melodies 
and 
symphonic 
harmonies 

sprinkled into the “30 Rock” 
theme music that always puts 
me into a good mood. When-
ever I need an old friend to 
turn to, I not only look for my 
favorite shows, but my favorite 
intros that accompany them. 
The classic tunes never get old, 
and my love for them grows 
each time I watch these pro-
grams.

Television 
is 
a 
versatile 

medium that is constantly 
changing. Shows are evolving 
into new and exciting genres 
and formats, and so are their 
intros. One thing that will 
never change, though, is my 
unwavering 
infatuation 
for 

these beautiful gems. Love 
them or hate them, TV intros 
are here to stay, and I will 
be right there beside them, 
always giving them my love 
with a sweet embrace and a 
five-star rating.

Iconic and Timeless: An ode to TV’s 
memorable and comforting intros

A look into the charm of television’s beloved and overlooked feature

This past Tuesday, El Club 

in Detroit was packed to 
near capacity with flannel-
clad, mostly bearded twenty-
somethings eager to see one 
of indie rock’s most revered 
bands — the almighty Cloud 
Nothings. I (also flannel-clad, 
slightly bearded and twenty-
nothing) quickly slipped to 
the back of the crowd to enjoy 
the band for what was about 
to be my first time.

Cloud Nothings expertly 

seized the crowd by opening 
with “Pattern Walks” from 
2014’s Here and Nowhere 
Else, showcasing drummer 
Jason Gerycz’s insane skill. 
Gerycz’s 
control 
over 
his 

individual limbs bordered on 
absurdity, as his arms flailed 
across his kit and the bass 
drum beat with incredible 
dexterity. I couldn’t tear my 
eyes away until the nearly 
eight-minute 
track 
closed, 

when I turned to my friend 
and said, “Just watching him 
play almost gave me an asth-
ma attack.”

The band is touring in sup-

port of their phenomenal new 
record, Life Without Sound. 
By adding a fourth member to 
assist lead singer/songwriter 
Dylan Baldi in covering their 
complex guitar melodies, the 
band was able to achieve a 
full, complete sound in per-
formance. 
Highlights 
from 

the record included lead sin-
gle “Modern Act” which had 
the crowd singing along to 
the anthemic chorus: “I want 
a life, that’s all I need lately 
/ I am alive but all alone.” 
The band quickly fired up the 
crowd with the heavier cut 
“Darkened Rings,” exciting 
the already rowdy mosh pit — 
and finally motivating me to 
dive in.

Baldi 
sounded 
as 
caus-

tic and lively as ever, while 
remaining perfectly precise 
in his guitar playing. Each 
song sounded as tight as the 
recording, 
only 
amplified 

through the wildness of the 
crowd and the intimacy of the 
venue. The setlist consisted of 
tracks that boasted both his 
more melodic monotone and 
gravelly screams, command-
ing the crowd’s intensity with 
ease.

The 
band 
obliged 
the 

crowd’s pleas for an encore 
with 
Attack 
on 
Memory’s 

magnum opus “Wasted Days” 
— not only opening their set 
with a long track but bookend-
ing it with another. The crowd 
matched the band’s energy to 
the very end, returning every 
scream of the mantra — “I 
thought I would be more than 
this” — while throwing each 
other in euphoric disarray 
throughout every impressive 
instrumental 
section. 
The 

band’s 
unison 
throughout 

the chaotic instrumentation 
was a stunning testament to 
their musicianship and hard-
earned status in the indie 
rock scene.

The bottom line is, Cloud 

Nothings 
have 
cement-

ed themselves as some of 
indie rock’s greatest talent. 
Through their captivating and 
engaging live performance, 
and continual ability to put 
out fantastic records (even 
according to the “holier-than-
thou” Pitchfork) that emanate 
effortless talent, Baldi and 
company have proven to be 
some of music’s most essential 
artists of the 21st century.

‘M’ to begin season 
at USF Tournament

The 
road 
to 
Michigan’s 
potential third-straight Women’s 
College Softball World Series 
begins in the same place it has 
since 2013.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines 
will play five games in three days 
at the USF Wilson-Demarini 
Tournament 
in 
Tampa 
Bay, 
Fla., starting with back-to-back 
contests against Delaware and 
Illinois State on Friday.
But Saturday poses the toughest 
matchups for Michigan, as it 
opens the day with a showdown 
against No. 4 Florida, followed 
by an evening affair with No. 25 
South Florida. 
The 
Gators 
defeated 
the 
Wolverines in game three of 
the 2015 championship, leaving 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
short of her program’s first title 
since 2005. Last year’s season-
opening tournament saw Florida 
tear through that wound viciously 
with an 8-0 mercy-rule victory.
Despite the history with the 
Gators, senior right-hander Megan 
Betsa refuses to treat Saturday’s 
matchup any differently than she 
would against another opponent.
“I’m sure everyone is going to 
tell you the same thing: it doesn’t 
really matter who we’re playing,” 
Betsa said. “It’s the first weekend, 
so we’re just going to learn how 
to go out there and be better. It 
doesn’t really matter if we’re 
playing Florida.”
In the same afternoon of the 
Florida beatdown last year, the 
Wolverines turned around to 
wallop USF, 11-2, in five innings. 
Saturday gives Michigan another 
chance 
at 
those 
opponents, 
especially — admittedly or not — 
at the Gators.
While the warm weather and 
quality competition are benefits 
of early-season tournaments, they 
do pose two challenges for the 

Wolverines: fatigue and managing 
the pitching staff. Playing the 
weekend’s five games in less than 
48 hours forced Hutchins to alter 
her usual practices.
“Going into this week, we 
had to be just as concerned with 
being fresh on the weekend,” 
Hutchins said. “We have to taper 
our swings, we have to taper our 
pitches and really shore our game 
up and shorten up practice. The 
first weekend is rough, they’re 
not in game shape. I can tell you 
they’ll be sore and tired on Sunday 
morning.”
This means Betsa — the only 
established pitcher returning from 
2016 — and junior Tera Blanco 
will share duties in the circle for 
Michigan, with sophomore Leah 
Crockett potentially joining them.
Betsa, who posted a 1.98 
earned-run average and threw 
over 200 innings last season, will 
get the ball Friday in the final 
opening day of her career. When 
Blanco gets the opportunity to 
pitch, her usual spot at first base 
will likely be taken by junior 
Aidan Falk. But Hutchins remains 
firm that the lineup has not been 
etched in stone. 
“I’ll have to see how they look, 
and I don’t have a set lineup,” 
Hutchins said. “We’re going to see 
who gets it done when it matters 
and go from there. It’s definitely 
an evolution.”
Even 
with 
the 
collective 
accolades of Michigan’s senior 
class, Hutchins sees the team’s 
motivation deriving from the fact 
that 2017 is a new chapter in a 
storied program’s history.
“This is team 40,” Hutchins 
said. 
“We 
don’t 
have 
any 
championships — they’ve done 
nothing. What teams 31-39 have 
done are on our history boards 
— they have no bearing for team 
40. We motivate them with ‘Who 
are you, and what are you going 
to accomplish?’ We’re zero and 
zero.”

New faces make up
Michigan’s rotation

Just two of the Michigan 
baseball team’s four starting 
pitchers from last year will be 
returning to the mound next 
week when the season begins. 
The Wolverines have no 
reason to worry, though. Junior 
left-hander Oliver Jaskie will 
still lead the pitching staff 
after an impressive sophomore 
season, and he has plenty of 
teammates capable of playing 
alongside him.
Jaskie finished the 2016 
season with a 3.19 earned-run 
average and seven wins in 14 
starts. He was second on the 
team with 69 strikeouts and 
will enter his junior season 
with the most experience in 
Michigan’s pitching rotation.
As a veteran player, he will 
be able to take advantage of this 
leadership role to help shape 
the Wolverines’ new staff.
“Anybody on our pitching 
staff is going to be able to 
handle a lot of different types 
of roles,” Jaskie said. “We are 
just, top to bottom, filled with 
guys that throw a lot of strikes 
and love to compete on the 
mound, so I’m really excited for 
what this pitching staff has to 
bring this year.”
With the departure of former 
pitchers Evan Hill and Brett 
Adcock due to graduation and 
the MLB Draft, respectively, 
holes were left to fill on the 
mound.
Fortunately for Michigan, 
there is no lack of potential 
candidates 
to 
fill 
these 
positions.
Junior right-hander Ryan 
Nutof’s role varied last season. 
He started 11 games but also 
contributed to the team as a 
reliever in 10 other contests. He 
ended his sophomore season 
with a 3.67 ERA through 54 
innings. He boasts the second-
highest strikeout total of the 
returners with 50.
Nutof will look to capitalize 

on his versatile abilities and 
establish himself as a regular 
starter on this year’s squad.
But, he will have to compete 
with junior right-hander Alec 
Rennard – a transfer from 
Santa Rosa Community College 
– whose accolades speak for 
themselves. He concluded his 
sophomore season with a 1.4 
ERA and 90 strikeouts.
After 
the 
2016 
season, 
Rennard was named Big-8 
Conference 
Pitcher 
of 
the 
Year and was a First Team 
All-American, all after leading 
his team to a California State 
Championship title.
“He’s 
got 
a 
winner’s 
mentality,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich. 
“He’s 
definitely one of our top four 
starting pitchers and he’ll be 
in our rotation somewhere. 
Where he fits on the weekend, 
we’ll see.”
Nothing is set in stone, 
though. 
Junior 
left-hander 
Michael 
Hendrickson 
was 
injured last season but is now 
healthy and ready to take a spot 
in the starting lineup, yet that 
likely won’t be an easy task. 
After pitching just 10.2 innings 
last year, his experience level 
lacks in comparison to Jaskie 
and Rennard.
In addition, senior right-
hander Keith Lehmann started 
two games last year and could 
make a push to start more this 
season, while freshman right-
hander Karl Kauffman also 
aims to be in the rotation as 
well.
If Kauffman doesn’t make 
an appearance this year, he is 
definitely one to watch for in 
the future. He was the No. 1 
recruit in the state of Michigan 
after his senior high school 
season.
With so many new faces – 
and a few old ones – Bakich has 
not yet finalized any decisions. 
Next weekend’s game will be 
the first opportunity to see 
who can handle the pressure on 
the mound for the Wolverines.

BASEBALL
Michigan to face Spartans in “Duel in the D”

For Cooper Marody, Joe Louis 
Arena represents the home of 
some of his favorite moments from 
his childhood. The sophomore 
forward recalls attending Detroit 
Red Wings games with his father 
and even a few Great Lakes 
Invitationals — while growing up. 
He always dreamed of playing 
at “The Joe,” and Friday night, 
along with the rest of the Michigan 
hockey team, he will play there 
for a final time during the regular 
season.
Adding 
even 
greater 
significance, the Wolverines will 
face off against in-state rival 
Michigan State, as both are looking 
to claim the Iron D Trophy.
“My whole life I’ve been a die-
hard Michigan fan,” Marody said. 
“I obviously didn’t like State, so 
every time you play these games 
there’s higher emotion, the whole 
crowd gets into it. There’s a lot on 
the line and we’re gonna try to play 
the best we can.”
Added senior goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort: “In the past, you 
could say ‘Oh it’s the last time (for 
me) at Michigan, but maybe you’ll 
be playing against the Wings in 
the coming years’. But this year’s 
different.”
As a senior, Nagelvoort will 
relish one of his last opportunities 
to play at the arena when the Big 
Ten Tournament begins in mid-
March. But after this season, the 
“Duel in the D” will move to Little 
Caesars Arena, and Joe Louis 
Arena will become a memory of 
the past.
This week, former Michigan 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 
published 
a 
letter 
online 
detailing his favorite memories 
and experiences at the arena. 
Nagelvoort and some of his 
teammates read the letter and 
couldn’t help but feel a similar 
nostalgia.
“ … It’s always been really cool 
to have the opportunity to play 
there,” Nagelvoort said. “There’s 
a lot of people who make negative 
comments about what the facilities 
are like at the Joe. I personally 
love it. It’s one of my favorite rinks 
that I’ve had the opportunity to 
play at, besides Yost of course. It’s 

exciting to get to play there again 
tomorrow. I know I’m gonna enjoy 
it, it’s gonna be interesting to catch 
myself looking around, enjoying 
the moment because it’s a really 
cool venue to play games at and it’s 
sad that it’s the last time.”
The weekend series could also 
be one of the last times Nagelvoort 
and his fellow seniors will play 
against 
their 
counterparts 
from East Lansing. He grew up 
playing with certain members 
of the Spartans’ roster, and now, 
after nearly four years of playing 
against each other, Friday and 
Saturday night could be the the 
last time. There won’t be another 
GLI or “Duel in the D” — just two 
more matchups this weekend and 
perhaps an opportunity in the 
postseason.
Though given where Michigan 
and Michigan State currently sit in 
the standings — second to last and 
last, respectively — a matchup in 
the postseason is unlikely.
“Some of the kids (on Michigan 
State) I grew up playing against 
and playing with,” Nagelvoort 
said. “Guys like (Spartan forward) 
Joe Cox, we played our entire 
childhood together, we’re really 
good friends. On the ice, we hate 
the guys, it’s a fun rivalry, it’s a 
really intense game. But that all 
ends when you get off the ice.
“It’s a fun game to be a part of 

and it’s gonna be really exciting, 
especially because it’s one of the 
last two games we play against 
each other at Michigan. For it to be 
at the Joe is really cool.”
In this final series against 
Michigan State, the Wolverines 
will look to build upon their 
offensive 
performance 
last 
weekend. For the first time all 
season, it seemed as if their offense 
finally came to life. They outshot 
an opponent consecutively — a 
first — and scored five goals in 
both games.
Still, 
Michigan 
ended 
the 
weekend with only one victory, 
something that Michigan coach 
Red Berenson believes may have 
stemmed from struggling special 
teams play. In the last six games, 
the Wolverines have scored just 
three goals on the power play while 
allowing eight on the penalty kill, 
a margin that Berenson believes 
is imperative to improve should 
Michigan wish to compete in the 
upcoming stretch of the season.
“I couldn’t have told you before 
the weekend that we would 
give up seven power play goals,” 
Berenson said. “On the other side, 
I couldn’t have told you that we 
would’ve scored 10 goals at home. 
We’ve only scored five goals once 
all year. You never know those 
things going in. You play hard, you 
play the right way, and then some 

good things happen.”
An added bonus for Berenson 
is the re-emergence of Marody, 
who, after missing the first half 
of the season due to academic 
ineligibility, notched his first-
career hat trick Friday and 
added another goal in Saturday’s 
game.
“I think he’s motivated, he 
couldn’t wait to play,” Berenson 
said. 
“He 
was 
practicing 
in 
October, 
November 
and 
December. He couldn’t wait to play 
in the GLI. Then, he was rusty, he 
wasn’t as quick, he wasn’t as sharp 
from practicing as he needed to be 
in games. I think every game he’s 
shown glimpses of what he can 
do, and last weekend he finally 
got some offensive things going. 
That’s the player that we were 
seeing in practices, but we didn’t 
see it in the first few games.”
Friday, for one of the last times 
in their careers, Marody and 
Nagelvoort will play at Joe Louis 
Arena. Marody will reminisce 
about the times with his father and 
Nagelvoort will recall the three 
GLIs he played in at the arena over 
the years.
But as a whole, Michigan will 
play a game against a bitter rival 
and hope to emerge from its last 
regular season game at a historic 
arena with a victory. 

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily
Senior goaltender Zach Nagelvoort will play one of his last games at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on Friday night.

Behind Enemy Lines: James Blackmon Jr. 

The Michigan men’s basketball 
team certainly got its revenge. 
After losing to Michigan State, 
70-62, in East Lansing on Jan. 
29, the Wolverines welcomed the 
Spartans to Crisler Center and 
sent them home with a 29-point 
loss. 
Derrick Walton Jr. led the way 
for Michigan, finishing with a 
game-high 20 points on 7-for-10 
shooting while also contributing 
eight assists and five rebounds. 
With his stat line, the senior guard 
became just the third person in 
program history — behind Jalen 
Rose and Gary Grant — to record 
1,000 points, 400 rebounds and 
400 assists in their Wolverine 
careers.
But Walton and the rest of his 
team don’t have much time to 
dwell on the milestone.
With a matchup against Indiana 

at Assembly Hall on Sunday, 
the Wolverines are looking to 
notch their first road win of the 
season against the Hoosiers. The 
matchups away from Crisler have 
not been kind to Michigan, as it 
has lost by an average margin of 
10 points on the road — including 
three blowouts at South Carolina, 
UCLA and Illinois.
Indiana, 
though, 
seems 
to 
be the perfect candidate for the 
Wolverines to get over that hump. 
In the first matchup between 
the two, Michigan cruised to a 
30-point victory, and the Hoosiers 
have lost four of their last five 
games.
Still, they have played No. 7 
Wisconsin and No. 16 Purdue 
competitively, losing to each by 
just five points.
And Assembly Hall also can’t 
be forgotten, as it has always 
been a notoriously difficult venue 
to play in — something that is 
reflected in the Hoosiers’ 13-2 
home record.
Perhaps the biggest advantage 
Indiana will have, though, is the 

return of James Blackmon Jr. The 
junior guard has been sidelined 
since sustaining a lower-leg injury 
during the first meeting with 
Michigan, but he made his return 
Thursday night against Purdue. 
Though he scored just 11 points 
on 3-for-14 shooting, he did notch 
a team-high 32 minutes, so all 
signs point to him being fully 
healthy as his team prepares for 
the rematch with the Wolverines. 
If he can return to his usual form 
— averaging 17.6 points and 4.9 
rebounds — Blackmon could help 
send Michigan home still winless 
on the road.
The Daily sat down with 
Blackmon at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to talk about the ACL 
injury he sustained during the 
2015-16 season, his decision to 
not enter the NBA Draft and his 
role on the team following former 
Hoosier guard Yogi Ferrell’s 
departure.
The Michigan Daily: You’re 
coming off an ACL injury that kept 
you out of the Big Ten season last 
year. How are you feeling?

James Blackmon Jr.: Yeah 
definitely. I think I’m ready to 
play. I feel better than I did before. 
I feel more athletic and a lot 
stronger as an all-around player, 
and I feel like that’s completely 
from my rehab.
TMD: Are you excited for 
the Big Ten season this year 
considering the fact you couldn’t 
play last year?
JB: Definitely. Missing the 
season is so hard, so coming into 
this season, that’s one of the things 
I’m most looking forward to.
TMD: You thought about 
heading to the NBA like your 
teammate 
Thomas 
Bryant, 
what do you think of the NCAA 
allowing players to test the waters 
of the NBA Draft before they 
decide whether or not they want 
to enter?
JB: I think it’s a good rule. It 
gives players a chance to chase 
an opportunity and a dream. But 
at the same time, they can also go 
back to school. So you’re not losing 
anything, and you’re taking full 
advantage of your opportunities.
TMD: Yogi Ferrell has not been 
liked by Michigan fans over the 
past couple years. What was it like 
playing with him?
JB: It was good because every 
day he got the most out of me, 
and I did the same for him. We 
pushed each other every day and 
that’s what you need. You want a 
competitive guy to push you.
TMD: Now that he’s gone, the 
point guard position is open. Is 
that a position you’re looking to 
play?
JB: 
Yeah, 
I’m 
definitely 
comfortable with playing the point 
guard. But I think anyone can take 
that role on the team. It’s not just 
me.
TMD: Being a leader on a team 
with such high expectations, how 
do you shoulder those expectations 
and play under that pressure?
JB: I don’t think it’s really 
pressure. If you put in the work 
everyday and prepare, it should 
just come.

Wolverines set for matchup with Big Ten bottom dweller Wisconsin

For the second time this season, 
the Wolverines are hoping to scare 
off some Badgers. 
The No. 21 Michigan women’s 
basketball team 
will be hosting 
Wisconsin 
in 
its 
annual 
Pink Game for 
breast 
cancer 
awareness 
Sunday. 
The 
Wolverines 
(9-2 
Big 
Ten, 
20-5 
overall) 
are coming off 
their 20th win 
of 
the 
season 
after dominating 
Purdue, 
72-61, 
and have yet to lose at Crisler 
Center. 
“It’s just another game,” said 
freshman guard Kysre Gondrezick 
after a win against Iowa on Feb. 
5. “But, ultimately, we talk about 
protecting the ‘M’ and protecting 
our own court.” 
The team motto, according to 

Gondrezick, has been to “just find a 
way to win.” For the Wolverines, the 
crux of that has been Gondrezick, 
who scored a career-high 25 points 
to notch her fourth 20-plus scoring 
performance of the year. Gondrezick 
went 9-for-13 from the field and 
4-for-7 from the 3-point range. 
The 
success 
against 
the 
Boilermakers was rounded out 
with contributions from sophomore 
Hallie 
Thome, 
junior 
guards 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
and 
Jillian 
Dunston and senior guard Siera 
Thompson. Remarkably, Thompson 
played all 40 minutes of the contest. 
The defense, led by Dunston, has 
proven to be the backbone of this 
team. Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico has worked to improve both 
press and zone defense on her squad, 
which was evident in the come-
from-behind victory against Iowa in 
the final minute. 
“I think what happens sometimes, 
and it’s happened to us in the past, is 
when you change defenses and then 
come back to an old defense it shakes 
it up a little bit,” Barnes Arico said. 
“So when we went zone and then we 
save the press kind of until the end … 
it was more effective than just doing 

it all the time.” 
But, it’s hard to fathom Michigan 
needing that much strategy in its 
upcoming contest. 
The impending matchup with 
the Badgers (1-10, 6-18) won’t be 
too threatening for the Wolverines. 
They are ranked for the first time 
since 2013 and have won 20 of its 
first 25 games for the first time in 
program history, while Wisconsin 
has only won one game against a 
conference team. 
The Badgers most recent game 
was that first win on Thursday 
against Nebraska. Wisconsin is 
sporting top players in junior guard 
Cayla McMorris and fifth-year 
senior forward Avyanna Young. 
The two lead the team, averaging 
12.9 and 10.2 points per game, 
respectively. 
Yet, the Badgers poor shooting 
has hindered the team. They 
rank last overall in the Big Ten 
conference, and 13th — in front of 
only Rutgers — in scoring and field 
goal percentage. Wisconsin has 
managed to shoot just 46 percent 
from the field, compared to its 
opponents, who have averaged 45. 
In the last meeting between 

the Wolverines and the Badgers, 
Michigan swept the court, 73-56. 
Thome led the charge with 37 points 
and 14 rebounds, while going 13-for-
15 from the floor and 11-for-13 from 
the free throw line. 
The Wolverines trailed by a point 
after the first quarter but managed 
to hold a seven-point lead at halftime 
to head a breakaway for the win. 
Wisconsin tends to lead strong, but 
Michigan matches that with its 
reputation of breaking away during 
the third quarter and suppressing its 
opponents on the defensive end. 
Michigan hopes to continue 
its home-court success while also 
notching another win against the 
Badgers. Its win streak at Crisler 
brings confidence, but no Michigan 
player wants to sit comfortably and 
assume a win. 
“Definitely looking at other 
team’s records (helps),” Thome 
said. “You have the (other team’s 
numbers) to prove that you can beat 
them. But, I think that in the Big 
Ten, any day, it’s like any team can 
step up and beat you. The Big Ten, 
knowing what kind of conference 
it is, you just got to bring your best 
game every day.”
