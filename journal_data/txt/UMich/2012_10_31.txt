At her yearly leadership
breakfast, University President
Mary Sue Coleman announced

the formal creation of a center
that will be dedicated to study-
ing the ecological health of the
Great Lakes.
The project is closely tied
with the Great Lakes Resto-
ration Initiative, an- endeav-

administration to strengthen
preservation efforts in the Great
Lakes region. Since its inception
in 2009, the GLRI has evolved

ROYAL OAK, Mich. - Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) made a
visit to a Republican campaign
office here Tuesday to recog-
nize Michigan residents' hur-
ricane relief efforts and thank
volunteers for their efforts in
support of Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney's
campaign.
With recent polls projecting
a narrowing margin between
the two presidential candidates
in the state, both campaigns
have worked to rev up last-
minute efforts in Michigan.
McCain's impromptu Michigan
visit comes on the heels of a
slew of campaign stops by for-

mer first lady Laura Bush and
Ann Romney, the wife of the
GOP nominee, throughout the
state earlier this week.
The Obama campaign also
confirmed Tuesday that it
would buy its first television
ads in Michigan. The ads will
begin airing Thursday and run
through Election Day for the
first time this campaign.
Romney campaign spokes-
woman Kelsey Knight said
McCain stopped visited Bloom-
field Hills and Royal Oak Vic-
tory Centers in Michigan to
stress the efforts of GOP cam-
paign headquarters throughout
the state to assist the victims of
Superstorm Sandy, which rav-
aged the East Coast this week.

Members of the University's
chapter of College Republicans
crowded into a Mason Hall
classroom on Tuesday night
to discuss plans for the final
week of campaigning leading
into Election Day, as recent
polls show a constantly nar-
rowing margin between the
two presidential candidates.
About 30 members of the
group attended the meeting,
which featured visits from
Michigan Supreme Court can-
didate Colleen O'Brien and
Republican University regent
candidates Dan Horning and
Robert Steele. Attendees also
discussed way to advocate for

the Republican ticket both
nationally and locally.
In an Oct. 24 Fox 2 News
Detroit poll of likely Michigan
voters, President Obama led
Romney by only 46.92 percent
to 46.56 percent, a difference
well within the 2.93 percent
margin of error.
Horning, who previously
served as a regent from 1995 to
2002, told the College Repub-
licans that this election has
the potential to influence the
political reasoning of the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents,
which he said has been liber-
ally slanted for too long.
"The liberal agenda (on the
board) ... is not looking out for
you," Horning said. "We can't

University President Mary Sue
Coleman announced a host of
new initiatives, ranging from
renovations of the Earl V. Moore

new fellowship for undergradu-

During the 45-minute speech

Plates and Politics seeks
to merge politics with
food, a combination that
yields fruitful discussion,
LSA sophomore Samantha
Schmitz, the group's presi-
dent, said.
With Election Day just
around the corner, the group
'seeks to educate its members
about prominent issues and
policies in an attempt to cul-
tivate informed student vot-
ers leading into the election
on Tuesday. Schmitz said
as the club's president she
works to establish a com-
fortable atmosphere to talk
about political views and
explore civic engagement

through sharing meals.
"It is a place where stu-
dents can share thoughts on
a particular political topic
in a safe and welcoming
environment while enjoy-
ing a home cooked meal,"
Schmitz said.
Schmitz said she finds
that food brings together
disparate opinions no matter.
how polarized the national
political discourse is.
"Politics can definitely be
a dividing factor between
people," Schmitz said. "We
judge others based on their
political stance on an issue
rather than discussing why
they feel the way they do

about a topic. Food is a great
way to bridge those differ-
ences in feelings about poli-
tics. Who can really get mad
at someone else over a bowl
of chicken noodle soup?"
This year, most of the
group's monthly meetings
have been dominated by
election conversations, but
the group plans to share
their knowledge with other
students outside of the orga-
nization.
"The best way we've been
able to help other students
learn about the upcom-
ing election is by word of
mouth," Schmitz said.

remains at a loss about how to
stop the Syria violence. The U.S.
and other Western and Arab
nations have called on Assad to
step down, while Russia, China
and Iran continue to back him.
In the latest fighting after
nightfall Tuesday, the 'Britain-
based Syrian Observatory for
Human Rights said 18 civilians
were killed in an airstrike and
tank fire Tuesday in the Hajari-
yeh neighborhood in the suburb
of Douma, northeast of Damas-
cus.
The dead included four
women and five children, the
group said, adding that the toll
could rise as residents were still
searching through the rubble.
Five rebel fighters were also
killed in clashes with regime
forces elsewhere in Douma, the
group said.
Amateur videos posted online
showed a deep, rubble-filled
crater in the middle of what
appeared to be a poor neighbor-
hood, with many walls collapsed

in the blast.
Men were seen chanting "God
is great!" while pulling a man-
gled body from the rubble in one
video. They used their hands to
dig through cinder blocks and
cement dust in another to uncov-
er another dead body.
In yet another video, a man
standing in the destruction yells
at the camera, "These are the
accomplishments of Lakhdar
Brahimi," referring to the inter-
national envoy who proposed the
recent, failed cease-fire.
Regime airstrikes also col-
lapsed buildings in the rebel-
held northern city of Maaret
al-Numan, which straddles a key
supply route from the capital to
Aleppo, Syria's largest city and a
main front in the civil war:
Assad's regime has been
hammering away at Maaret al-
Numan, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
southwest of Aleppo, with heavy
airstrikes since it fell to rebels on
Oct. 10.
One amateur video purport-

ing to show the aftermath of an
airstrike on Tuesday showed a
man holding up the dead body
of a small girl in a red and white
shirt and baby blue pants. Other
videos showed men carrying
bloodied women and children
from destroyed buildings.
The Observatory said the day's
airstrikes on the city killed at
least seven people, four of them
children.
One video showed the bodies
of three girls wrapped in white
shrouds. Nearby, a man dripped
water on the face of a dead older
man with a white beard, saying:
"Go to heaven, dad. May God
take revenge."
The Observatory said at least
one rebel fighter was also killed
in clashes south of the city, and
regime forces were trying to
bring in reinforcements from
further south.
Activist claims and videos
could not be independently veri-
fied because of restrictions on
reporting in Syria, but the vid-

eos appeared genuine and cor-
responded with other Associated
Press reporting on the events
depicted.
Violence also flared elsewhere
in and around Damascus. The
Observatory said missiles fired
from a fighter jet struck the
capital's Jobar neighborhood -,a
rare hit in the capital's munici-
pal area. Most of the fighting
around Damascus for the past
few months has been in sub-
urbs and outskirts, where rebels
have managed to challenge the
regime.
Syria's state news agency
said an "armed terrorist group"
assassinated a high-ranking air
force general. Maj. Gen. Abdul-
lah Mahmoud al-Khalidi was
gunned down while getting out
of his car in the mostly Kurdish
neighborhood of Rukn Eddine in
Damascus.
The government views the
rebels as terrorists and accuses
them of being foot soldiers in a
foreign plot to destroy Syria.

From Page 1A
Romney has taken heat in the
media for a statement he made
during the Republican prima-
ries in which he said he would
cut spending to the Federal
Emergency Management Agen-
cy and instead transfer relief
efforts to states and private
companies. Despite the criti-
cism, Knight emphasized Rom-
ney's contribution to the storm
relief in lieu of campaigning as
proof of the candidate's dedi-
cation to aiding victims of the
natural disaster. Romney spent
Tuesday in Ohio at several simi-
lar events aimed at storm relief.
"What we're seeing is our
Victory Centers being open to
help the people that have been
affected by this hurricane,"'
Knight said. "He's going to
make sure that people who are
affected by the hurricane are
taken care of first and foremost
and he'll continue to do that for
the next four years."
Though Romney claimed
he suspended his campaign in
order to do relief work, volun-
teers called potential support-
ers for the campaign during the
event, in addition to collecting
cans and clothes.
McCain spoke to the small
roomful of volunteers, thank-
ing them for their efforts and he
encouraged them to boost sup-
port of Romney in the next six
days. He then discussed what
he characterized as President
Barack Obama's poor foreign
policy showing, specifically
referring to the withdrawal of
troops from Iraq and the rise of
al-Qaida throughout the Mid-
dle East and North Africa.
McCain faulted President
Barack Obama for not using the
words "victory" or "success"
when he announced the grad-

ual withdrawal of American
troops from Iraq.
"This guy has the nerve to
say we got bin Laden," McCain
said. "We also know that four
more years of Barack Obama
and we would have one heck of
a steep hill decline. We need to
get rid of this jerk."
McCain completed his brief
talk by thanking everyone for
working on the campaign as
well as collecting goods for
storm victims, adding that the
future of the next generation
depends on this campaign.
"We're doing the Lord's
work," McCain said.
Romney volunteer Irene
Egner, a Beverly Hills, Mich.,
resident said she has been vol-
unteering for the Romney cam-
paign for more than a month,
and was making calls on behalf
of the campaign when McCain
came to speak. She said she sup-
ports Romney's values, which
she believes is reflected in his
campaign's spearheading of the
relief effort.
"I'm a real American, and my
children are flag-waving types
and I still sing the Star Span-
gled Banner with my hand on
my heart," Egner said. "Rom-
ney is full of those values, his
whole family is, and they are
an all-American family in every
way."
Knight said the Romney cam-
paign's commitment to winning
Michigan can be demonstrated
in the dispatching of surrogates
to various part of the state in
the last few days, claiming that
the presence of the Obama cam-
paign has been lackluster.
She added that the polls are
"tight" in Michigan and the
Romney campaign plans to
keep the momentum going up
until Election Day.

Mayor: It may take
four or five days
to restore subway
service
NEW YORK (AP) - Stripped
of its bustle and mostly cut off
from the world, New York was
left wondering Tuesday when
its particular way of life - car-
ried by subway, lit by skyline
and powered by 24-hour deli -
would return.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
and the power company said
it could be the weekend before
the lights come on for hundreds
of thousands of people plunged
into darkness by what was once
Hurricane Sandy.
Bloomberg said it could also
be four or five days before the
subway, which suffered the
worst damage in its 108-year his-
tory, is running again. All 10 of
the tunnels that carry New York-
ers under the East River were
flooded.
Sandy killed 18 people in New
York City, the mayor said. The
dead included two who drowned
in a home and one who was in
bed when a tree fell on an apart-
ment. A 23-year-old woman died
after stepping into a puddle near
a live electrical wire.
"This was a devastating
storm, maybe the worst that we
have ever experienced," Bloom-
berg said.
For the 8 million people who
live here, the city was a different
place one day after the storm.
In normal times, rituals bring

a sense of order to the chaos of
life in the nation's largest city:
Stop at Starbucks on the morn-

On Tuesday, those rituals

Coffee shops, normally open

New York found itself less caf-

from the world, although by
afternoon it had begun to strug-

Some bridges into the city
reopened at midday, but the
Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, con-
necting Brooklyn to Manhat-
tan, and the Holland Tunnel,
between New York and New
Jersey, remained closed. And
service on the three commuter
railroads that run between the
city and its suburbs was still sus-
pended.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said bus
service would be restored at 5
p.m. EDT, on a limited sched-
ule but free. He said he hoped
there would be full service on
Wednesday, also free.
The New York Stock Exchange
was closed for a second day, the
first time that has happened

the outages.

:Bernstein and Diggs for regents
Clear ideas can impact students' debt burdens
F or the 2012 election cycle, 10 candidates will vie for two open
seats on the University's Board of Regents. At the forefront
of the race are Democratic candidates Mark Bernstein and
Shauna Ryder Diggs and Republican candidates Dr. Rob Steele and
Dan Horning. In endorsement interviews with The Michigan Daily,
all four candidates placed the greatest emphasis on tuition rates and
the University's accessibility to prospective students.

A nutritious choice

There's no doubt that eco-
nomic downturn has left
many Americans strug-
gling, and this is
reflected in the
rise of families
applying for fed-
eral assistance
programs. Food
assistance has
especially spiked
according to the H.RSHA
Congressional
Budget Office. NAHATA
About 45 mil-
lion Americans
- one in seven -_applied for the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program in 2011. In 2010, five mil-
lion fewer people applied for pro-
grams like food stamps.
Concurrently, obesity rates
among low-income individuals
continue to be disproportionately
high. With food stamps affecting
such a large part of this popula-
tion, the healthiness and effective-
ness of the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program has been called
into question. Groups advocating
for nutrition and health argue tax-
payer dollars shouldn't be used to
fund junk food. While combating
growing obesity and helping people
develop nutritious eating habits
should be a policy goal, regulating
what people can and can't buy with
food stamps isn't the way to do so.
Sen. Ronda Storms (R-Fla.) pro-
posed a bill that would prohibit
using food stamps to buy sugary,
fatty or highly processed foods.
Her proposal bans a broad range:
"foods containingtrans fats; sweet-
ened beverages, including sodas;
sweets, such as Jell-O, candy, ice
cream, pudding, popsicles, muffins,
sweet rolls, cakes, cupcakes, pies,
cobblers, pastries, and doughnuts;
and salty snack foods, such as corn-
based salty snacks, pretzels, party
mix, popcorn, and potato chips," as

reported by The Miami Herald.
Storms defends her bill claiming,
"If we're going to be cutting ser-
vices across the board, then people
can live without potato chips, with-
out store-bought cookies, without
their sodas."
What she fails to mention is that
parts of her bill are so restrictive it
may make it impossible to purchase
something as simple as a birthday
cake for a child. Yes, it's important
to be nutritious, but not at the cost
of cutting out an entire food group
for an individual, simply because
they are ina position of dependency
and helplessness.
Florida isn't the .first state to
propose such a ban. In 2010, New
York City Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg attempted to ban the use of
food stamps to buy sugary bever-
ages. He was met with opposition
from advocacy groups - like the
New York City Coalition for Hun-
ger- for low-income individuals,
arguing primarily that it "punishes
poor people for the supposed crime
of being poor."
And in a way, that is exactly what
such a law would do. Dictating what
can and can't be bought with food
stamps is targeting those who are
dependent on the social protection.
Yes, we want to encourage healthy
lifestyles, but forcing people to eat
healthy isn't the way to do so. There
are no laws dictating that average
Americans can't go out and buy
junk food. Stipulating that those
with food stamps specifically can't
is discrimination against society's
most vulnerable.
Additionally, food stamps are
rarely enough to sustain a family
for anentire month. Even with food
assistance, people struggle to make
ends meet. Reporter Katie Evarts,
from Southern California Public
Radio, took a challenge - she spent
one week eating on a food stamp
budget. Her spending cap? $36.50.

Having to buy a week's worth of
groceries with so little put her in a
very difficult position. And that was
only for one person.
Eating healthy
is a national
priority.
Evarts interviewed a family on
food stamps, and their story reveals
just how difficult it becomes to bal-
ance a food stamp budget. As one
recipient says, "I can't buy as much
healthy food as I'd like to buy. It's
expensive. I mean I can buy three
weeks' worth, but other than that
you know we have to stick to card-
board boxes and Hamburger Help-
er and all that kind of stuff."
As a result, when budgeting food
stamps for the month, people tend
to maximize their usage. They buy
canned food that lasts longer, junk
food they can easily find coupons
for, and preserved food that can
be bought in bulk. Even with food
stamps, healthy food is too costly
for people to invest in.
Eating healthy should be a nation-
al priority. Encouraging nutrition is
necessary, especially when the CDC
reports that more than one-third of
adults and more than 17 percent of
children in America are obese. But
the way to do so isn't through com-
pulsion - it's through education.
Beinghealthy is a choice. It's a choice
we want to encourage people, to
make, but in the end it's a choice that
is theirs to make.

Horning believes his previous term as regent
from 1995 to 2002 offers him a fresh perspec-
tive that puts him in a unique position to cor-
rect the mistakes he alleges were made by the
current regents.
"Having sat at the table, and dealt with the
needs and the intricacies and the workings of
the University of Michigan, I've now spent 10
years" involved in a variety of ways with the
University, said Horning.
Horning says the regents' decision to sup-
port a group of graduate student research assis-
tants who wanted the right to unionize was one
of the greatest missteps made in his absence.
He views it as an example of the board over-
stepping its bounds, since University President
Mary Sue Coleman, Provost Philip Hanlon and
a majority of the University's deans opposed
the measure.
The decision, Horning alleges, was the first
step toward a "slippery slope" that could lead
to further abuses of power by the University
community.
Though Horning's enthusiasm and back-
ground as a former regent couple well with
his goal to curb the University's rising
tuition, his vehement stance against union-
ization is troubling. Furthermore, many of
his ideas aeka-lear focus.-He has several
viable ideas that include tuition refunds for
students who stay in-state to work and a cap
on tuition increases, but vaguely suggested
that funding these projects involved "better
utilizing the endowment."
Republican candidate Rob Steele, a cardi-
ologist and University alum, placed a similar
emphasis on retaining Michigan's talent by
proposing tuition refunds for students study-
ing science, technology, engineering and math
concentrations who stay in Michigan for five
years or more after graduating. He also said
the endowment should be invested in students'
financial aid options and, like Horning, feels
in-state students should take precedent, since
there's incentive to reject highly qualified in-
state applicants in favor of higher tuition rates
garnered from out-of-state students. .
However, Steele's dismissal of social issues
such as tuition equality for undocumented
students and his inordinate focus on STEM
concentrators at the expense of other students
hampered his eligibility as a candidate. It sim-
ply doesn't encourage across-the-board acces-
sibility to focus on only one demographic of
the student population. Furthermore, his sug-
gestion that the University require two terms
dedicated to the study of America, including
the study of the Constitution and Declara-
tion of Independence, implies an excessively
nationalist bent.
Democrat Shauna Ryder Diggs said her
greatest strength is the ability to facilitate
agreement amid fierce opposition. Though
she was unaware of a variety of special inter-
est issues raised by students at the University,
including the Coalition for Tuition Equality,
she positions herself as a flexible candidate,
able to listen and wisely mediate discussion to
find solutions to divisive campus issues.
n Furthermore, Diggs acknowledged the
board's role in appointing the next University
president, since Coleman's contract expires in
2014. She underscored the importance of the
decision with the desire to appoint a president

who isn't "a top-down administrative type."
Ryder Diggs instead prefers a "ground-up con-
sensus-builder."
Though attorney Mark Bernstein shared his
fellow candidates' concerns for the University's
financial welfare and accessibility to eligible
students, the precision and efficiency of his
message raised him above other contenders.
Where the rhetoric of many candidates is full
of baseless promises and abstractions, Bern-
stein said he isn't content with simply identify-
ing problems. During his appeal for the Daily's
endorsement, he outlined the most empirically
researched, comprehensive and realistic plan
possible to ensure the University's continued
economic viability and accessibility to low-
income students.
The research.Bernstein presents is as hon-
est as it is compelling. Following recent tuition
trends established over the last decade, "tuition
for a child born today in Michigan will be over
$300,000 by the time they're old enough to go
to college," Bernstein said.
"That is unsustainable, and it's completely
unacceptable," he added.
Bernstein's experience with investment
banking makes him especially qualified to
address the significant burden of student debt.
He said the University should expand the func-
tionality of its AAA credit rating and 2.3-per-
cent interest rate it borrows under to construct
"buildings,hospitals andstadiums"by"passing
along" the savings to students, allowing them
to borrow money for their education atunprec-
edentedly low interest rates. The average stu-
dent would save about $5,000 on their college
education under Bernstein's plan, he said.
He also suggested offering lower rates for
classes that were held during periods of low
facility utilization. Students who take classes
inthe early morning, evening, weekend, spring
and summer would enjoy lower tuition rates,
since their classes occur when the University's
resources (electricity, water, etc.) are at their
lowest utilization rates.
Horning and Steele's desire. to keep stu-
dents in the state and decrease tuition costs are
admirable, but their lack of flexibility regard-
ing issues such as tuition equality, unionization
and minority enrollment was disconcerting.
Worse yet, their best ideas for making the Uni-
versity more financially viable were under-
mined by their reliance on the University's $7.8
billion endowment.
Bernstein explained that since most of the
endowment money is supplied by donors with
specialinterests,theUniversitycan'tlegallyuse
the endowment as a default source of funding
for investments and other financial initiatives.
It took him less than a minute to invalidate his
opponents' mostthoughtful plans.
Therefore, vote Mark Bernstein, the
most studied and well-prepared candidate,
and Shauna Ryder Diggs for the University
Board of Regents. Though Diggs' flexible,
even-minded approach to the regent position
makes her a suitable candidate, the Detroit
Free Press asserted that her nomination may
be the result of a deal struck by departing
Regent S. Martin Taylor - her father-in-law -
and the labor unions that influence the party
nominating conventions. Shauna Ryder Diggs
receives our endorsement for the second open
seat, but not overwhelmingly.

The slate is grel-at

J 's the fall of 2013, and three
incoming freshmen walk
into the Union's Computer

Showcase, each
looking for a
computer that
will weather
their college
years. One's an
Engineering
student, one an
English major,
and the third
is, undecided
but considering
informatics.

ERIC
FERGUSON

They each take a stroll around
the place, take in everything the
Showcase has to offer, and ultimate-
ly settle on three different devices
that run different operating systems
and have differently sized screens.
They're all buying laptops, right?
Think again. The introduction of
devices such as Microsoft's Surface,
the latest iPad and various Android
devices has launched tablets into
a heyday. The devices are rapidly
replacing both the laptop and the
large smartphone in the modern col-
lege student's technological arsenal.
There's a method behind this
seemingly mad suggestion. When I
look at the 13-inch laptop I'm typ-
ing this piece on and the 4.5-inch
smartphone sitting next to it, I see a
shameful redundancy. Both devices
have word processors, cameras,
music players, basic video editing
capabilities and screens to consume
media and play games on. They
can also access the Internet, and
through it, an ever-increasingnum-
ber of apps and information.
What distinguishes the two are
the laptop's size. and the smart-
phone's calling and texting capa-
bilities. The laptop can do nearly
everything the smartphone does at
a far higher level and on a far more
viewable display - other than call
people over a mobile network.
And the smartphone's size is

necessarily smaller than a laptop's
in order to keep the mobile phone
"mobile." The tablet is the logical
next step, able to do almost every-
thingbetter than alarge smartphone,
perform all but the most strenuous
computing tasks, and able to be easily
slipped into the bag, purse, or back-
pack of your choice.
Though the hardware in a tab-
let may become outdated relatively
quickly as new ones are introduced,
its basic capabilities- have already
advanced to the point where the same
tablet could be used for yearswithout
an upgrade. Thanks to cloud storage
like Google Drive, office software is
free to acquire and easy to use, and
many video sharing sites have their
own apps that work on devices of any
generation. And with high-definition
displays already standard on many
tablets, it makes sense that apps and
videos made in the next few or even
the next half-dozen years would dis-
play acceptably, if not well, on even a
relatively old tablet.
For college students, all of the
above should make buying a tablet in
favor of a smartphone or a laptop a
no-brainer. Wi-Fi is a given on this
campus, and there are a plethora of
cases and covers available that give
tablets a full keyboard. Also, the
tablet's smaller size compared to a
laptop would make sense for taking
notes, especially in buildings like
Lorch Hall's Askwith Auditorium
and the Dennison Building, where
the amount of desk space allotted for
each student is barely sufficient for a
laptop of any size. And even though
the commercials during the World
Series extolled the capabilities of the
latest smartphones, dropping $100-
200 on one every two years while
buying a decent laptop at some point
makes little sense when a $500 tab-
let has so much power and versatil-
ity. Considering this, along with the
tablet's support from wireless carri-
ers who give them mobile Internet
access, why would anyone want to

buy a big smartphone?
A tablet makes sense even for
those students who need the pro-
cessing power of a full-fledged com-
puter, considering that between the
Sites and CAEN computers located
around campus, there are more
than 1,500 computers available for
use and even more when including
the computers in the dorms. These
computers are equipped with the
advanced audio and video, pro-
gramming, engineering and design
software needed by students in
multiple programs.
Laptops and
smartphones are
being replaced
by tablets.

U

4

Though the technology involved
does not currently support tablets,
there are also virtual computers
that are available for use on one's
own machine that have the same
software as the Sites and CAEN
workstations. As tablets take off,
it'll only be a matter of time before
they are able to take advantage of
this virtual computing power.
Though those of us who are
already in college may be attached
to our laptops and our increasingly
massive smartphones, the next gen-
eration of students will know better.
Between their capabilities and the
existingdigital substructure already
in place at the University, tablets and
smaller, though still "smart", phones
are virtually guaranteed to become
ubiquitous around campus in the
next few years.

Glasper's 'Black Radio'
remixed in 'Recovered'

By ADAM DEPOLLO
For the Daily
Arriving on the heels of Feb-
ruary's critically acclaimed
Black Radio,
jazz pianist
Robert Gasp-
er's new release Robert

The Remix EP Buck Radio

examination of Blue Note
five tracks from
the February
release - and a new tribute to J-
Dilla.
Black Radio featured an amal-
gamation of styles - not strict-,
ly jazz, R&B or soul - and a
stunning list of guest features,
including Yaasin Bey, Lupe
Fiasco, Bilal, Lalah Hathaway
and Erykah Badu. The remix EP
picks up where Black Radio left
off, adding contributions from
?uestlove and the Roots, Sol-
ange Knowles and 9th Wonder,
among others.
Glasper's original release cre-
ated a smooth, soulful ambiance
by way of his piano which, when
not busy soloing, provided open
and airy jazz-tinged riffs. These
proved best when accompany-
ing the sultry vocal stylings of
Erykah Badu on "Afro Blue" or
in contrast with Yaasin Bey's
staccato, fast-paced rapping on
"Black Radio." However, Black
Radio stumbled a bit in terms of
sonic quality: The bass often felt
overpowering, and the tracks in
general seemed a bit muddy, with
the exception of Glasper's piano
(which, for the most part, was
clean and crisp).
The Remix EP has generally
remedied the sonic shortcomings
of its predecessor - with the
exception of the original track
"Dillalude #2" - creating a much
crisper texture, particularly

by way of the bass and drums.
Unfortunately, this cleaner sound
comes atthe expense of the piano,
which is often overpowered by
the percussion, and falls into the
background.
In terms of content, the EP
pulls the songs more toward
the hip-hop spectrum and away
from jazz and R&B. This can
most clearly be seen on "Let-
ter to Hermione," which now
features a verse by Black Milk,
and "The Consequences of Jeal-
ousy," which, in remix form, has
something of an '80s throwback
vibe (not unlike the work of
Theophilus London). In general,
the remixes feature much more
sampling, more hip-hop drum-
beats and a less prominent role
for Glasper's piano.
The original track, "Dillalude
#2," works off of the same con-
cept. Glasper's jazz touch is more
clearly evident as the song breaks
down into a dark, sensuous piano
and bass riff, and at the end of
the song, where he works a sub-
tle paraphrase of J. Dilla's "Fall
in Love" instrumental into his
outro.
When you collect the amazing
group of musicians and produc-
ers featured on Black Radio into
a studio together, magic is bound

to happen. When you get even
more amazing musicians to take
those same songs back into the
studio and put their own spin on
them, even more magic should
be expected. This is clearly the
case with Black Radio Recovered.
We can't wait
to see the third
incarnation.
The work by ?uestlove et. al.,
for the most part, has remedied
the sonic shortcomings of the
EP's inspiration, while add-
ing new flavors and colors to an
already stunning musical expe-
rience. Strict jazz fans will prob-
ably prefer Black Radio to this
new EP, but even for such picky
audiences, the homage to J. Dilla
features enough of Glasper's
piano prowess to make this new
release worth a listen.
Bottom line: The work done
by Glasper and his collaborators
here is worthy of the same praise
received by its predecessor, and
in some respects, improves on the
original product.

Some 'Nightmares'
found on most
recent release
By JACKSON HOWARD
For theDaily
Upon signing with Rick Ross's
Maybach Music Group imprint
in 2011, Meek Mill seemed des-
tined to fill

the role of the
label's in-house
"street" rap-
per. Meaning-
less guest spots,
uninspired
and somewhat
worthless mix-
tapes added up

Meek Mill
Dreams and
Nightmares
Warner Bros

from.
Meek stays true to his roots
on his debut album, Dreams and
Nightmares. The record's main
flaw is summed up in the title -
the album has dreams (the party
songs) and nightmares (the hood
songs), and really nothing else.
Dreams and Nightmares is more
of a polished mixtape than an
actual album, filledwiththe same
gritty street tales, booming trap
beats, three Ross guest spots and
head-scratchingly stupid lines.
The title track starts off the
album perfectly. It begins with a
calm,piano-ladenbeat,withMeek
lazily rhyming about his journey
to stardom ... and then bam! The
real beat comes in. "Hold up wait
a minute /Y'all thoughtI was fin-
ished?" Meek yells to the listener,
almost offended, and then goes on
to absolutely demolish the track,
barking out lyrics with bombastic
energy.
The album then plays out
expectedly, with mixed results -
there are the dreams, laced with
money, women and alcohol, and
there are nightmares, filled with
drugs, guns and the hood. The
album sits at a solid 14 tracks, but
it feels a lot shorter, considering
that many of the songs are carbon
copies of one another.
One of Meek's strengths has
always been his storytelling. On
"Traumatized," the better of the
two street tales on the album,

to little-to-no label support for
his debut album (if it would ever
be released).
As time passed, however,
something incredible happened
- Meek Mill became a rap super-
star. He was no longer the MMG
back-up plan - he was the future.
By 2012 he was on tour with
Drake, signed to Jay-Z's manage-
ment team and featured Mariah
Carey songs, all while remain-
ing the very same corner boy.
This is Meek Mill's appeal: He is
the voice of the streets, a ghetto
superstar. And though he has
made it big time, he definitely
hasn't forgotten where he came

he viciously swears to kill his
father's murderer, and vividly
recounts growing up in the hood
with just his mother.
"Believe It," featuring label
boss Ross, is vintage MMG
head-splitting trap music. It's
something that Meek was born
to do, and the two work off each
other like Shaq and Kobe in their
primes (Yes, Ross is obviously
Shaq). Rozay brings his A game,
and comes close to outshining
Meek simply on the basis of his
ridiculous chorus: "I gotta bad
bitch in my Chevy / Sellin' Miley
Cyrus in my brand new Monte
Carlo / I got that Justin Bieber
please believe it / A quarter mil-
lion hangin' on my collar."
Best of all is "Amen," the first
single, featuring Drake. The
song, with a buoyant piano loop
and an infectious chorus, strikes
the perfect balance between pop
hit and hood anthem, arid Meek
sounds perfectly at home.
Some dreams, though, can
turn into nightmares.
"Maybach Curtains," featur-
ing Ross, Nas and John Legend,
had the potential to be a classic
track, but instead became a com-
plete mess. Legend is out of place,
the beat sounds cheap and the
song as a whole is utterly cheesy.
Meek follows the trend of rappers
buying a Nas feature in order to
appear serious, and, unsurpris-
ingly, ends up getting completely
outshined - hearing the two rap-
per's verses back-to-back is like
watching a high school basketball
team play the Miami Heat.
On the first track, Meek raps,
"Double M / Yeah that's my team
/Rozaythe captain/I'mthelieu-
tenant." Dreams and Nightmares,
then, is a success for Meek, as
he has finally risen from the
unknown private he was two
years ago. Only his next album,
however, can prove if he has what
it takes to move up to captain.

M' tops Titans, 2-1

Despite missed opportunities,
Wolverines dominate Detroit

By SHANNON LYNCH
FortheDaily
In one of its last home show-
ings and with the goal of gaining
a spot in the NCAA Tournament
in mind, the Michigan men's soc-
cer team braved the wind and
rain to battle the University of
Detroit Mercy. The game was
by no means an easy one and
nerves were high at the end, but
the Wolver- ,
ine offense DETROIT 1
dominated MICHIGAN 2'
from the
moment it first stepped on the
field, winning by a final score of
2,1.
Coming off a victory over Val-
paraiso on Saturday, the Wolver-
ines (2-2-1 Big Ten, 7-8-1 overall)
wanted to keep the tempo op at
home. Earning another win was
important not only to secure a
better standing, but also in prep-
aration for next Saturday's game
against Michigan State.
"I think any local game is a
big sense of pride," said Michi-
gan coach Chaka Daley. "I think
for us, we beat Oakland, we beat
Detroit, the last hurdle is Michi-
gan State."
The competitive tone had a
definite impact on gameplay for
both teams, and from the start
the atmosphere at the U-M Soc-
cer Complex was tense.
The Wolverines maintained
possession for the majority of
the first half and it was clear the
Titans were frustrated. After
Michigan's first three shots on
goal, Titan midfielder Adam
Bedell was issued a yellow card
for diving.
Michigan earned 10 fouls and
a yellow card during the game
but Detroit lead the game in
penalties - it finished with nine
fouls, a yellow card, and three
red cards, issued to defender Pat-
rick Soltys and two of Detroit's
coaches.
Redshirt sophomore midfield-
er Tyler Arnone said he thought
that Michigan responded well
under the pressure of such a
hectic and emotionally charged
game.
"I think the game got out of
hand today, but that's something
to expect," Arnone said. "Both
teams wanted to win, and our
season was kind of on the line, but
as long as we're mature and keep
our cool, that's really it."
They did keep cool. Though

night despite firing a season-
high 28 shots.
The Wolverines displayed
a sense of urgency that was
in stark contrast to their last
two games - a 2-0 home loss
to Bowling Green last Tuesday
and a 1-0 win over Valparaiso on
Saturday, which needed junior
Fabio Perreira to find the game-
winner with just 90 seconds left
in regulation.
Michigan who seemed poised
to get on the scoresheet first and
unloaded an offensive barrage in
the first 15 minutes, outshooting
Detroit 6-0. But, the Wolverines
were forced to play from behind
after Jason Leslie's goal in the
41st minute gave the Titans at
the U-M Soccer Complex.
"The coaches really got after
the guys to make sure that
we didn't have a repeat per-
formance of what we had last
week," said Michigan coach
Chaka Daley. "But we gave up a
soft goal against the run of play.
We always learn from our mis-
takes. Sometimes we need to
take a little bit of ownership of
what's going on, and sometimes
they get it wrong. It's important
for us to make sure that we steer
them back on track."

PAULSHERMAN/Daily
Redshirt sophomore forward Tyler Arnone had one of Michigan's two goals in a
2-1 victory over Detroit at the U-M Soccer Complex on Tuesday,

Michigan outshot Detroit in the
first half (10-2); the Titans were
able to capitalize initially with a
goal by Jason Leslie in 'the 41st
minute of play. The Wolverines
coame back and settled the ball
quickly, keeping the pressure on
the Titans defense and forcing a
corner in the 45th minute.
Arnone lofted a long ball over
to the far side -of the goal, set-
ting tsp a shot by midfielder Latif
Alashe, which was stopped by
an intentional hand ball on the
Titans defense. This prompted a
red card for Soltys and a penalty
kick for Arnone with 13 seconds
left to play in the first half. He
buried the ball in the back of the
net to tie the game at one before
the half.
"We practice those type of
situations all the time, so when
that situation comes I am well
prepared for it," Arnone said. "It's
just routine for me, so I keep my
nerves cool and just do what I
know."
Michigan knew the benefit of
being tp a player when it stepped

back on the field for the last 45
minutes of play, but the teams
strategy hadn't changed.
"We wanted to continue to put
our foot on the pedal, we thought
we did that the first half," Daley
said. "All we did was impress
upon our guys not to relax, keep
the tempo high (and) stick at it.
We did, created a ton of chances,
if we stuck some of those away we
would have been a lot more com-
fortable at the end, we didn't."
The Wolverines had opportu-
nity after opportunity and finally
seized one in the 65th minute of
play when freshman midfielder
James Murphy pounded the ball
into the net off a rebound from
Arnone, giving Michigan the
lead.
Though Detroit was able to
put the pressure on in the last
minute of play with five shots on
goal, the Wolverines held on and
came out on top, adding another
victory to their four-match home
stand and going into the upcom-
ing Michigan State game on an
emotional high.

Redshirt junior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint hasn't gotten off on the right foot this fal, and Michigan is running out of time in the season.
Still no answers at tailback

A one-dimensional offense.

offense with senior quarterback
Denard Robinson out of the game
on Saturday, the running backs so
stifled they gained just six yards
in the second half. A seven-point
deficit never felt so insurmount-
able, nor had the tailback ques-
tion seemed so perplexing.
On Tuesday, redshirt junior
tailback Fitzgerald Toussaint
danced around explanations
for yet another sluggish perfor-
mance just like he danced around
running lanes. The lack of pro-
duction, he said, is no one's fault,
it's just good defense. In other
words, still no answers.
The running-back question
has baffled the Michigan offense
all season, but it reached a head
on Saturday when the tailbacks
generated a paltry ;32 yards on
the ground. Redshirt freshman
Russell Bellomy bore most of the
attention after the loss to Nebras-
ka, but Toussaint and senior
Vincent Smith were just as bad.
And they have five full seasons of
experience between them.
"Because we are a running
team, when we don't run well,
we don't play well," said offensive
coordinator Al Borges. "That's

For the Wolverines, that leaves
a lot of question marks. And
they're running out of answers.

The Michigan football team
boasts the best- passing defense
in college football, but the players
don't even care.
Fifth-year senior safety Jor-
dan Kovacs and sophomore cor-
nerback Raymon Taylor, two
integral members of the second-
ary, both shook their heads when
they heard the ranking on Tues-
day. They hadn't heard about it.
"It doesn't matter at all,"'
Kovacs said.
The numbers mightnot matter
to 'Team 133,' but they're impres-
sive nonetheless. The Wolverines
have allowed a nation-leading
145.3 passing yards per game,
and they have more interceptions
(7) than passing touchdowns
allowed (5).
For comparison's sake, Michi-
gan allowed 190.5 passing yards
per game last season, and over
220 passing yards per game for
each of the three previous sea-
sons under former, coach Rich
Rodriguez.
"We take pride in (our pass
defense)," Taylor said. "That's a
big thing. That's good to be num-
ber one in any thing, so we take
pride in it and appreciate it."
As Michigan coach Brady
Hoke was quick to point out dur-
ing a weekly teleconference on
Tuesday, the secondary's statis-
tics could be improperly skewed
byseveral factors.'
Alabama threw just 21 times in
the season opener - "They didn't
have to," Kovacs said. Air Force
and its triple-option attack ran
roughshod over Michigan's front
seven, but the Falcons passed
just 19 times. So while Michigan
is No. 1in passing yards allowed
through eight weeks, it has also
faced the sixth-fewest number of
pass attempts (198).
Kovacs cautioned that it might
be too soon to label the secondary
as elite. In the Wolverines' 23-9
loss to Nebraska in Lincoln last
Saturday,. Cornhusker quarter-
back Taylor Martinez passed for
just 166 yards, a touchdown and
an interception, but Kovacs said
there were open receivers that,
much to the secondary's delight,
Martinez simply didn't see.
"You can't let that happen,"
Kovacs said.

While the Michigan offense
stuttered and stalled in Lincoln,
the defense held relatively fast.
But Martinez engineered a drive.
early in the second quarter that
gashed the secondary for five
consecutive completions and
ended in a 32-yard touchdown
pass to receiver Kenny Bell.
When the defense took to the
film room on Sunday, the players
remembered exactly how that
drive felt and, more importantly,
what went wrong. Nebraska's
hurry-up offense had caught
them by surprise - Taylor said
they hadn't been preparing for
that tempo - and Martinez
picked them apart with ease.
The calls, selected by defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison
and then signaled onto the-field,
never made it across the field to
all 11 defensive players.
"Basically we were out there
lost for a couple plays," Taylor
said.
The defense's biggest goal isn't
a surprising one: communication.
"If you don't communicate,
you're not lined up and you're
not ready to play," Kovacs said.
"There's guys on the other side of
the field that don't see the signal.
"It's our responsibility as cor-
ners or safeties, whoever's closest
to the sideline, to relay that mes-
sage and keep relaying it until
everybody knows the play."
The crowd noise from the
Sea of Red in Lincoln certainly
played a significant factor, but
considering that three of the four
members of the secondary are
upperclassmen, Kovacs called
the communication breakdowns
"very disappointing."
Still, the Wolverines held Mar-
tinez and the upstart Nebraska
offense to its lowest passing
yards, rushing yards and point
total ofthe season. To remedy the
communication errors for this
weekend's tilt against Minne-
sota at TCF Bank Stadium - not
quite the ferocious atmosphere
that Nebraska has at Memorial
Stadium - Kovacs emphasized
that there's no such thing as over-
communication.
"Keep echoing the call,"
Kovacs said. "Coach Mattison
emphasized that today: you've
got to echo the call and you've
got to make sure you take care of
your buddies."

Faceoffs troubling Wolverines

By LIZ VUKELICH
DailySports Writer
Go to any Michigan hockey
game and you'll see the Children
of Yost getcrestless for the faceoff.
"Drop the puckt" they scream
at the referee, who dangles it in
front of the centers for what feels
like eternity to fans who just
want the game to resume play.
For most fans, the faceoff is a
blip in the game that doesn't last
more than a couple of seconds.
They're not too interested in it.
There are more exciting things
to focus on, like who scores or
who slams who into the boards.
For most hockey players, it's
just a routine part of the game.
They win some, they lose some,
but it shouldn't be anything to
lose sleep over.
But for eighth-ranked Wol-
verines, faceoffs are becoming a
troubling issue, and they're get-
ting more anxious for them than
they should be.
Michigan (1-1 CCHA, 3-2
overall) has been plagued with
a slew of bad faceoffs lately, the
most recent of which resulted
a crucial third-period goal for
Miami (Ohio) in the Wolverines'
4-3 loss on Saturday night.
"I can't tell you (faceoffs) are
(always) a concern as they've
jumped up and bitten us
already," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "We give up ... a
handful of goals (that) have been
on faceoffs. That shouldn't be."
In Saturday's miscue, Curtis
McKenzie scored Miami's game-
winninggoal just moments after
a quick breakaway from the
circle in Michigan's zone. With
the whole play happening in just
seconds, the Wolverine defense
barely had time to react to losing
the draw before their goaltender
had been beat.

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Sophomore forward Travis Lynch is one of the Michigan hockey team's primary faceoff-takers.

"I think (the goal) was just
a communication error," said
sophomore forward Travis
Lynch. "I know the defensemen
didn't talk to the forwards on
that one, so that's why there's
some confusion on that. It cost
us for sure."
That goal reflected the worst
of the faceoffs in the Miami
series, in which Michigan won
less than half of the draws. But
it's still a major concern, espe-
cially when the Wolverines con-
sider that they're losing most of
the draws in the most dangerous
part of the rink: their own defen-
sive zone.
On Friday, for example, Mich-
igan went 1-for-12 in faceoffs
in its own zone. As Berenson

points out, he can't expect the
players to win draws in their
opponents' end if they can't even
win enough to protect their own
goal.
Senior forward A.J Treais is
arguably the Wolverines' stron-
gest center, and Berenson usu-
ally trusts the captain enough to
pit him against the opponent's
best center on the draws.
But against the RedHawks,
Treais' position at the point
on the power play meant that
faceoff responsibilities fell to
someone else. It shouldn't have
been a problem - according to
Lynch, the team prides itself
on the draws - but something
about the system got lost in
translation last weekend.

"(We) have to take each draw,
make it more important and
really focus on winning those,"
Lynch said. "If we lose a draw,
then we have to get in shooting
lahes (and) make sure no one
gets outof place and is notopen."
Berenson didn't even try to
hide his frustration about the
faceoffs after the series. Though
he plans to put more emphasis
on draws in practice this week,
there's still no guarantee of any
improvement during games.
"Part of it is mental and the
other part of it is actually tech-
nique and working on it," Beren-
son said. "We will definitely be
working on faceoffs. And we
have been (working at it) enough
to be better at it than we are."

Environmental Protection Agen-
cy and the White House Council
on Environmental Quality, and
has received more than $1billion
in funding for hundreds of ongo-
ing projects.
The Water Center, which will
operate within the Graham Sus-
tainability Institute, will be a
consortium of universities, with
contributions from Ohio State
University, the University of
Wisconsin and the University of
Notre Dame. The center will also
be available for use by a variety
of governmental agencies.
The University will contrib-
ute $4.5 million to its funding
and an additional $4.5 million
will come from a donation by
the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb
Family Foundation.
Engineering Prof. Don Sca-
via said the Great Lakes have
always been an important topic
on campus, and the creation of
the center signifies a critical
advancement in how the lakes
will be studied.
"The conversation on campus
about rebuilding the Great Lakes
(has been going on) for around
eight years, as long as I've been

suggested an academic plan that
he said would heighten aware-

"My suggestion is that if you
have to take four semesters of
a foreign language, then you
should have to take two semes-
ters of the language of Ameri-
can freedom which includes
one semester on the founding

then you have a semester on
some general economic studies...
about the role of free enterprise
and free markets."

helping those in need helps can

Lurie spoke to students in Weill

"new philanthropy" approach to
alleviating poverty. Under Lurie's
unique method, the board of the
Tipping Point Community under-
writes all operating and fund-
raising costs for grant-receiving
organizations so that donor funds
are going directly towards the
effort to fight poverty and not to

Lurie was invited to speak to
students as part ofthe Social Inno-
vation Series sponsored by the
University's Nonprofit and Pub-
lic Management Center, which
profiles people who have crossed
boundaries to provide innovative
solutions for society's challenges.
"We're hoping to spread the
message of Tipping Point and this
issue of fighting poverty is a really
important and critical one not
only for the Bay Area but for our
country," Lurie said. "The more
we can get this type of model out
there in different cities across the
country, the better."
 Lurie said he was pleased with

Graham Institute and the Erb
Family Foundation.
The grant is the third that the
Erb Family Foundation has given
to the University. Previous dona-
tions included a $500,000 grant
for comprehensive mapping of
threats in the Great Lakes and a
$200,000 "challenge grant" for
third-year students at the Uni-
versity's Erb Institute for Global
Sustainable Enterprise.
Scavia said faculty will begin
to write grants for projects
through the Water Center this
spring.
The Water Center's primary
focus will be on techniques for
removing toxic pollutants in the
Great Lakes, combating invasive.
species and restoring wildlife
habitats. Undergraduate stu-
dents will have the opportunity
to engage in faculty-sponsored
research when the center has
been established and grants are
finalized.
The Great Lakes have received
national media attention in
recent years because of high-
ly publicized and expensive
attempts to prevent Asian carp,
an invasive aquatic species, from
entering Lake Michigan. The
Army Corps of Engineers has
spent millions of dollars on an
artificial barrier near Chicago in
attempt to prevent their entry,
but water samples above the
barrier are consistently testing
positive for the presence of Asian
carp DNA.
Coleman said the formation
of the center demonstrates the
University's dedication to Michi-'
gan's natural resources.

"As a university, we need to
take on ownership and respon-
sibility of regional sustainability
challenges that affect us close
to home and where our exper-
tise can have enormous impact,"
Coleman said.
J. Val Klump, the associate
dean for research in the School
of Freshwater Sciences at the
University of Wisconsin-Mil-
waukee, said in a press release
the center will regularly gather
policymakers and scientific
leaders to consult on feasible,
scientifically sound solutions to
persistent problems.
"This is a much needed
effort to engage the broader
academic community, and we
are excited to be a partner in
building a stronger science
base for Great Lakes restora-
tion," Klump said.
Though water quality has
improved in recent decades, the
International Joint Commis-
sion - the collaborative group
between the United States and
Canada tasked with monitor-
ing the Great Lakes'. ecological
health - wrote in 2009 that the
lakes are beginning to face new
threats.
"In the past, human health
concerns addressed by the gov-
ernments have focused on legacy
contaminants," the report stated.
"While these materials remain of
concern, current and emerging
threats to human health include
a suite of substances and prob-
lems ranging from algal blooms
to little-regulated materials
often found in consumer prod-
ucts."

WALLENBERG
From Page 1A
from concentration camps. He
was arrested by the Soviets and
never released.
Coleman said the world is
still seeking answers about Wal-
lenberg's death, but noted that
he directly helped save Andrew
Nagy, a professor emeritus
of Atmospheric, Oceanic and
Space Sciences, who was asteen-
ager during the war.
In honor of Wallenberg's
courage, Coleman announced
that the University would
establish an undergraduate fel-
lowship. Though criteria for
the award has yet to be final-
ized, each year, one graduating
senior who has demonstrated a
commitment to public service
is eligible to receive a $25,000
stipend to pursue humanitarian
interests anywhere in the world.
The award will begin with this
year's graduating class.
The University previously
honored Wallenberg in 1990
through the establishment of his
namesake medal and lecture.
The medal is awarded yearly
to individuals from around the
world for a variety of political,
charitable, humanitarian and
cultural achievements. Previ-
ous recipients have included
Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and Holocaust survivor
Elie Wiesel, both winners of the
Nobel Peace Prize.
MOORE BUILDING
RENOVATIONS
The largest ticket item
announced at the breakfast is a
proposed $23-million renova-
tion of the Earl V. Moore build-
ing on North Campus. Built in
1964, the building has become
rundown and is no longer able
to accommodate the increased
number of students, Coleman
said.
"I know the faculty from
Music, Theatre and Dance will
agree when I say this project is
overdue," Coleman said.
If approved by the Universi-
ty's Board of Regents atits Nov.
15 meeting, the University will
contribute $14 million toward
the project, complemented by
an $8-million donation from
alumni Bill and Dee Brehm.
The University will also seek
another $1 million from smaller
donors.
Additions to the building will
includea large rehearsal hall for
use by the University Symphony
Orchestra and the University
Symphony Band, renovations of

existing halls and classrooms, a
new entryway and the addition
of practice spaces, among other
improvements, according to a
University press release.
"The School of Music, The-
atre and Dance is a point of
pride for Michigan, with tal-
ent second to no one," Coleman
said.
According to Jerry May,
the University's vice president
for development, the renova-
tion was largely spurred by
the Brehm family's $8-million
donation. The Brehms have
previously contributed more
than $60 million to a variety of
projects, including an expan-
sion of the Kellogg Eye Center.
They've also funded diabetes
research, the establishment of
two named professorships and a
scholarship program for gradu-
ates of Fordson High School in
Dearborn, Mich. who attend the
University.
"(Bill Brehm) has a great
love of music. He records, he
plays, he produces," May said.
"One day he called and said, 'I
want to do something. Put some
ideas together.' This is another
in his series of philanthropies
for things that he's passionate
about and he cares about."
May said because of the com-
plexity of the project, involving
both additions and renovations,
he was unable to give a definite
timeframe for its completion,
but estimated about two years
of work once the project begins
in 2014.
Earlier this year, the Univer-
sity's School of Art & Design
received a similar donation of
$32.5 million from alumni Roe
and Penny Stamps, leading to
the school's renaming as the
Penny W. Stamps School of Art
& Design.
HARVARD PROFESSOR
TO LEAD HEALTHCARE
INSTITUTE
Coleman also announced that
Harvard University physician
John Ayanian will serve as the
first director of the University of
Michigan Institute for Health-
care Policy and Innovation.
Ayanian, who has centered
his career on improving the
state of health care and advocat-
ing for equality, will lead a group
of more than 400 health care
and policy researchers when
he assumes his position next
month.
As the first IHPI director,
Ayanian will appoint associate
directors, establish research
priorities, support existing part-
nerships and create new collab-

orations locally, nationally and
globally. He will also recruit fac-
ulty within University schools
and colleges and increase
national visibility of the Univer-
sity's institute.
The institute was launched
in June, and will soon welcome
researchers from the Veteran
Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare
System, who signed a $866,574
multi-year lease for space in the
IHPI last week.
Though Ayanian is currently
a medical and health care policy
professor at Harvard Medical
School and Harvard School of
Public Health, he will be split-
ting his time between Ann
Arbor and Cambridge, Mass.
during his 10-month term to
oversee IHPI, which is located
in the North Campus Research
Complex.
Ayanian said he is looking
forward to taking on the respon-
sibility and working toward
tackling health care policy
issues.
"I'm very excited that the
University of Michigan is com-
mitted to investing in develop-
ingthe field of health care policy
and services research," Ayanian
said in an interview. "I think
that the goals that the Univer-
sity has for the institute are just
right to promote high quality,
safe, affordable and equitable
care. My goal as the new direc-
tor will be to help launch the
institute in the most successful
way possible to achieve those
goals in the health care system."
IHPI's research seeks to
examine the influence of health-
care policy and practice on
patient health over a wide range
of issues including diabetes, can-
cer, heart disease, mental health,
children's health and hospital
care, according to Ayanian.
Ayanian noted that collabora-
tion is an integral function for the
University and the effectiveness
of IHPI.
"By strengthening the quality
of the research and the collabora-
tionsthatpeoplehavehereaswell
as buildingstronger partnerships
with organizations outside the
University will allow us to have
the greatest impact as quickly as
possible," Ayanian said.
The diverse IHPI faculty
extends beyond the University
Medical School, and faculty
members hail from the 11 other
schools, colleges and institutes
across the University's many
disciplines and partnerships.
"There's a longstanding spirit
of collaboration that we'll be
building on and that's a very
exciting prospect for me," Aya-
nian said.


boasted by their opponents.
"We need stability in our
laws," O'Brien said. "That's why
I ran for judge in 1998,and that's
why I'm running for the Supreme
Court ... If you don't have consis-
tency and stability and judges
are kind of doing their own thing
and making their own laws,
then people aren't treated fairly
because the laws are applied
unequally."
O'Brien urged the College
Republicans to utilize Facebook
and other forms of social media
to campaign for conservative
candidates. She said spreading
awareness is particularly crucial
this year in local and state races
given that the majority of voters
focus their attention and knowl-
edge on the presidential race.
Business sophomore Elena
Brennan, the external vice chair
of the College Republicans, said
that on a generally liberal cam-
pus, Republican students must
work especially hard to gain
student support. In the coming
week, the College Republicans
will continue to sponsor Diag
days aimed at promoting con-
servative politicians at the local,
national and state level, and dis-
tribute flyers on campus.
She added that the College
Republicans also hope to be
especially active in door-to-door
campaigning and making phone
calls in the next week.

"I think that a lot of students,
especially who come from con-
servative backgrounds and are
conservative, are scared to kind
of come out and say that they are
and get involved on campus, and
that's why we're here," Brennan
said. "From the top down, it's
a liberal environment so we're
constantly combating that."
Engineering freshman Justin
Lopas said while he has chosen
to support Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney
because of the state of the econ-
omy, though the candidate was
not his first choice for the Repub-
lican nomination.
"The spending and just the
government control ... is just too
much and I think Romney will
turn that tide a little bit," Lopas
said. "Romney is much better
than Obama in terms of econom-
ic policies and I'm fairly moder-
ate on social policies, so I like
Romney for that as well."
Lopas expressed concern over
what he believes is a lack of polit-
ical interest and involvement,
noting that he has friends who
don't plan to vote.
Brennan concurred, and said
she believes students are hesi-
tant to appear overzealous in
their support of candidates.
"I would love to see more (stu-
dent interest in the election) - a
lot of the student body is sort of
apathetic to the political process."

"The students at Michigan
blew me away. The fact that we
have these institutions teaching
non-profit management, it's a real
important development for this
country and it's an honor to come
speak here," Lurie said.
Rishi Moudgil, the managing
director of the NPM Center, said
throughout the series, speakers
will be available to share their sto-
ries, and hold workshops for stu-
dents in their areas of expertise.
"This is the first speaker in our
series for the year," Moudgil said.
"Daniel is obviously coming 'in
and talking about his work with
Tipping Point, but we also have a
panel, a workshop, an opportunity
to meetwith students, aclassroom

words, but get into how things
work."
Moudgil said Lurie's presenta-
tion would teach students about
the different ways philanthropy is
implemented today.
"We know our students will be
inspired by his story, just being a
young philanthropist, and mak-
ing a really big change in his com-
munity," Moudgil said. "That's
important, to get exposure to folks
like that here."

Public Policy graduate student
Colleen Campbell said she attend-
ed to learn about different ways to
contribute to philanthropic orga-
nizations.
"Mr. Lurie's model is pretty
different from traditional philan-
thropy, so I am kind of interested
in bringing that model to colleges
and universities and see how that
can be sustainable," Campbell
said. "But also see how as a young
person, how I, can contribute to
philanthropy."
Public Policy graduate student
Imah Effiong said her past experi-
ences with nonprofits peaked her
interest in Lurie's speech.
"I'm just really interested in
various interesting strategies that
are coming out of the sector right
now, so I know when I graduate
from here what are some of the
tools I can use to run my own non-
profit one day," Effiong said.
Public Policy graduate student
Matt Papadopoulos, a member
of the center's student advisory
board who spoke with Lurie prior
to his speech, said Lurie was an
appealingspeaker to hear from.
"Dan Lurie is a very engaging
individual, he's young and he's
vibrant and he's excited about this
space, and that's very easy to rec-
ognize when you start speaking
with him," Papadopoulos said.

University's Department of Occu-
pational Safety and Environmental
Health. Warpehoski works as the
director of the Interfaith Council
for Peace and Justice, aninterfaith
organization that deals with edu-
cation and social action issues.
If elected, Berry said he would
focus on improving basic ser-
vices, work to reduce the budget
and dismantle some government
institutions, placing them in the
hands of citizen-based organiza-
tions or church groups.
"When it goes back to those
groups, people become more
involved in those organizations
and it involves a community
character," Berry said. "Talking
to people and- making sure that
we take care of those needs that
need to be taken care of."

Berry added he plans to
encourage increased discussion
on issues before they are passed,
noting that because he does not
have an "agenda" he would be
effective at facilitating discus-
sions.
"We need somebody on Coun-
cil (with) more opposing view-
points," Berry said. "Right now
there seems just to be unanim-
ity. For any organization you
need dissenting voices so you can
check and challenge ideas."
Warpehoski disagreed ,with
Berry's views, and said he
believes the Council has too
many factions. He said his time
as a social worker has helped
him focus specifically on areas of
common concern and find ways
to work together.
"It really strikes me that there
is not a lot of listening and a lot of
collaboration at times," Warpe-
hoski said. "I think that skill of

bridge building and listening is
going to be one of the key skills I
willbringCity Council ifelected."
Warpehoski said one of his
goals is to promote a healthier
neighborhood and a more com-
passionate and inclusive commu-
nity in Ward 5.
"We need to be providing
those amenities, that quality of
life, that really makes this a desir-
able community for people to live'
in, to open a business in," Warpe-
hoskisaid. "I am really proud that
our city has invested in providing
a social safety net, trying to pro-
mote environmental steward-
ship, and those are the things
(that) I would like to see moving
forward."
Warpehoski said he will most
prominently focus on being
responsive to the voices of citi-
zens and hopes to start a program
that actively solicits community
input.

ronmental depletion in its wake.
Perhaps most disturbing of all,
"The wealthiest 1 percent of Ameri-
cans own more than 80 percent of all
personal shares of stock," just as we
wrote at Port Huron. That unchanged
economic inequality threatens politi-
cal democracy at the core.
What can one say in the face of
these terrible challenges, so remi-
niscent of yesteryear? Perhaps, just
perhaps, the ripples of today's stu-
dent protest movements foreshadow
a coming revolt of those who will
not settle. Or perhaps today's gen-
eration will accommodate and live
the rest of their lives in a defensive
crouch. Who can be sure? We know
that movements begin unexpect-
edly. Rebellion begins anew, like a
first flower forcing winter's passing,
as it happened in Ann Arbor in that
springtime long ago. The Port Huron
Statement is a message sent in a bot-
tle, and participatory democracy a
tradition for future rebels to drink
from.

was jarring in and of itself. The
lengthy, Tea Party-esque intro
speech by the range captain, a
retired Marine, was also, by my
mildly elitist standards, highly
xenophobic and came dangerously
close to threatening the presi-
dent. And of course, there was the
8-year-old and her older brother,
both of whom had been shooting
rifles when my parents wouldn't
even buy me toy guns. The ease and
comfort with which they cleaned
their targets was surreal.
Maybe one day I'll understand
where these people are coming
from - the importance they place
upon their weapons and their con-
stant vigilance against whatever
perceived threat, be it foreign or
domestic, rational or absurd.
But now, I understand their pas-
sion, even if I still cringe at their
politics. That's the beautiful thing
about America; they have as much
of a right to advocate for their hal-
lowetd traditions as we do for gun
control and universal healthcare.

The right to bear arms
PERSONAL STATEMENT by David Tao

letter from the editors_
by dylan cinti and jennifer xu
our years ago, students took to the streets of downtown Ann Arbor
to celebrate the election of Barack Obama. University students
crowded alongside high-schoolers and other townies,' all marching
without any planned direction. After all, this was a joy that had to be
taken in collectively, strangers alongside strangers, all in celebration of a
presidential victory that seemed likea generational victory as well.
But the political landscape is a little different now.
This is not to say that Obama hasn't been a good president. We're not
out to make political statements about either candidate in this issue.
Because regardless of how the election turns out, we doubt there's
going to be the same post-victory march through the Deuce. This elec-
tion has been polarizing and highly political, with candidates pandering
to partisanship to an unprecedented degree. For the people represented
in this issue, though, that pandering has effectively blurred party lines.
A representative example is that of LSA sophomore Robert Cernak, a
student who says that he's upset with the polarizing efforts of both can-
didates. "There's a lot of mudslinging going on," Cernak said. "There's a
lot of people who are really angry at everyone else."
For people in this issue, such "mud-slinging" makes party lines dif-
ficult to discern. And with the blurring of these lines, we're forced to
ask ourselves questions. This is an election that makes us to confront
our core values. It's an election in which every vote must be an informed
vote. So regardless of who you vote for, make it count.
In closing, we'd like to say this: there is no excuse for not voting.
It's not only your right but your duty to do so. We don't mean to sound
preachy, but we've heard quite a few students say they're not voting
because they'd just be "choosing between the lesser of two evils," or
some variation on that. That's not a valid reason, it's a pathetic cop out.
If you really hate both candidates, then you can always write someone,
in. On that note, the legendary Tom Hayden also wrote something for
this issue. #Hayden2012?

random student interview
by kaitlin williams /illustrations by megan mulholland

Welcome to the Random Student
Interview,where we take a non-
partisan look at your political
decisions.
So, this is perfect. You're both
named Kelly and one ofyou goes
here while the other is from MSU.
You're even wearing green pants!
Kelly 2: Yeah. I had to rep myschool!
OK. I won't hold it against you
since it fits the subject for this
week's interview: decisions!
So, you're both probably over-
whelmed with decisions lately
with the election coming up...
Kelly 1: Elections? What about med
school?
Kelly 2: Yeah, and graduate school!
I'm here for Prospective Student
Day for the Master's in Social Work
Program.
Oh I see, youladies have more
important things...
Kelly 1: The election's pretty impor-
tant, but...
But, let's get down to the real
issues. Romney or Obama. Who
would you sleep with?
Kelly 1: Obama.
And why?
Kelly 1: If
he can get
Michelle, he
can get me.
I can follow that logic. So what
aboutyou (Kelly2)?
Kelly 2: Well, I go for personality,
and every time I look at Mitt Rom-
ney, I'm just disgusted because he's
such a douchebag, in all honesty.
Well, this is not a non-partisan

Kelly 2: And Obama's athletic. Have
you seen that man play basketball?
Yes I have. I've seen him playhbas-
ketball with kids, which is really
adorable.
Kelly 1: He played with actual pro-
basketball players. Which is really
cool
I hadn't seen that. So, who would
you rather get a drink with? Let's
pretend Romney would have a
drink for a second.
Kelly 1: Obama. He'd be way more
interesting.
Kelly 2: Is that even a question?
Obama again.
Well, I'd make the argument for
getting a drink with Romney
because he claims to have not had
a drink before...
Kelly 2: So you want to get him real-
ly drunk and listen to his horrible
political viewpoints?
Kelly 1: And I could tape it and leak
it to the Internet.
Exactly. We've got to be strategic
with our answers here. So think
for a second before you answer
this one. Who would you rather
go to the mallwith?
Kelly 2: I feel
" like Romney
4 might have
better taste.
Kelly 1: Rom-
ney might
spend more
money on me!
Good one.
Kelly 2: How old are Romney's kids?
I think they're closer to our age. So
he might know our style better.
Kelly 1: Yeah. Obama's girls are little
still.

Obama and Romney are?
Kelly 1: No.
Kelly 2: No idea.
Obama's 51..
Kelly 2: Obama's pretty young!
Kelly 1: That's really young for a
president.
And Romney's 65.
Both Kellys: What?
Kelly 2: He looks good for 65.
Kelly 1: I'm glad I said I would sleep
with Obama, because I'd definitely
rather sleep with a 51-year-old than
a 65-year-old.
Kelly 2: That's literally my grandpa's
age right now we're talking about.
Kelly 1: That's a little scary.
Kelly 2: Obama's got young kids for
being that old though.
Kelly 1: But Michelle is hot.
Yeah. Michelle is hot. Would you
like to work out with Michelle?
Kelly 1: Yeah! She brought all of the
"Biggest Loser" contestants to the
White House and worked out with
them.
Kelly 2: One of my residents last
year was on "The Biggest Loser!"
Kelly 1: Sorry, we're getting off-topic.
No, it's cool. I need to do group
interviews more often. One more
question, and this one is the most
important. What should I get for
lunch?
Kelly 1: Wendy's.
Kelly 2: Noodles & Company is my
favorite.
And justwhen I thought we could
agree on everything. I'm going
to have to go with Wendy's. Ihad
a bad experience at Noodles. Go
Blue!

Guns are loud.
That's probably the first thing I.
learned when I took my first fire-
arms training course this summer. They're
also surprisingly difficult to control; it's
nearly impossible to fire even the smallest
rifle accurately from a distance. Of course,
that wasn't a problem for the home-
schooled, 8-year-old girl shooting next to
me. Her shirt had an image of a Revolu-
tionary War-era minuteman accompanied
by slogans about marksmanship and its
essential ties to American heritage. And
as I walked downrange to examine my tar-
gets, I noticed her'disturbingly accurate
groupings.
Growing up middle class in the intense-
ly liberal Maryland side of the Washing-
ton, D.C. suburbs, guns weren't seen as an
unalienable right or a part of a long tradi-
tion of taming the wilderness. Guns were
for criminals and crazy people. Anybody
mildly informed about local affairs saw
this as blatantly obvious: D.C.'s gun vio-
lence numbers weren't great, and Balti-
more, a 45-minute drive away, was even
worse.
It seems disingenuous of me to say this
- my hometown of Bethesda was recently
ranked the top-earning town in America
- but these attitudes were also
backed up by personal experi-
ence. There were the Beltway
sniper attacks in 2002, when John
Allen Muhammad and his teen-
age accomplice, Lee Boyd -Malvo,
killed nine people and injured
three with a high-powered rifle.
Five of the shootings took place
in my school district - four of
them in a little under three hours.
As the news filled with reports
of more shootings, the county
kept schools under lockdown for
a harrowing three weeks, tight-
ening security even further once
the killers threatened area chil-
dren. Then there was high school,
where a fellow student ended up
in the hospital after accidentally
shooting himself. A little more
than a year later, three more stu-
dents were shot by gang members
while riding public transit; one of
them later died of his injuries.
That being said, I always found
guns fascinating, in the perverse,
immature way that adolescent
boys inevitably find loud, poten-
tially harmful things fascinat-
ing. I attended a math/science
magnet high school with a peer
group full of immature adolescent
r ends so;I .fp11d plenty of oppor-
tunities to . indulge these pas-

sions for the dumb and dangerous. Most
of these exploits involved substances from
the chemistry lab and a lighter: one time,
we soaked tennis balls in a liquid alkane,
lit them on fire and played catch, hoping
the alkane would burn out before the ball
hit us in the hands or face. Another time,
we made a makeshift smoke bomb using
potassium nitrate from a science project.
We're lucky none of us were hurts expelled
or arrested.
So it was with a mild sense of childish
excitement that I found myself making
the three-hour trek to Philadelphia this
summer to visit one of those high-school
friends, a pre-med student balancing a
summer research position at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania with MCAT prepara-
tion. It might have been the stress. Or it
might have been the boredom that inevi-
tably ensues from being stuck on a college
campus after all the students have left.
Whatever it was, he found himself mak-
ing an extreme kind of Internet impulse
purchase: a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, the
civilian version of what most of our troops
carry in Afghanistan. He told me about his
purchase over GChat one day and asked if
I wanted to learn how to shoot it with him.
You bet I did.

And that's how I found myself at an out-
door shooting range an hour west of down-
town Philadelphia with a loaner rifle in
my hands and cheap pieces of foam stuffed
in my ears, looking downrange through a
pair of protective glasses on loan courtesy
of the UPenn hospital. Many of the people
around me were from even farther west of
the city, the types of small-town residents
that then-Sen. Barack Obama accused of
deflecting lack of economic opportunity
by bitterly "clinging to their guns and reli-
gion" in 2008. Many on the far-left agreed
with Obama's assertion, just as many on
the far-right agree with Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney's comments
on the "47 percent."
But Obama's comments, and their belit-
tling implications about intelligence, are a
little off the mark. It's hard to argue with the
idea that these people cling to their guns -
they do, with obvious pride. But the general
idea that these people were dumb and aggres-
sively ignorant couldn't be more wrong.
Accurate target shooting takes an abun-
dant level of skill and intelligence; there's a
long list of complicated factors you have to
keep in mind - a list that extends beyond
the point-and-shoot braggadocio embraced
by the media. Sight picture: keep the sights

aimed just under the bulls-eye. Natural
point of aim: angling your body just so to
avoid muscle strain and keep your shots on
target. Trigger squeeze: squeeze gently, but
deliberately, and ease up after you've fired
so your sights stay on target. That's before
you factor in sling holds, ;which can cut off
circulation, but vastly improve accuracy.
For a soft city kid shooting a rifle out-
doors for the first time, I wasn't too shab-
by. With a .22, my shots were good for a
159 on the Army Qualification Test (AQT),
making me a "marksman" by military stan-
dards. On the other hand, my scores on my
friend's much larger AR-15 are something
I'd rather not discuss. Over the course
of the weekend, I gained a great deal of
respect for target shooters and their way
of life: their love for their craft, their dedi-
cation to safety and their respect for the
destructive power of their weapons.
That's not to say that the culture shock
ever really wore off. We've been over how
liberal my hometown is, and I've split the
first almost-20 years of my-life between
there and Ann Arbor. Trading driveways
filled with "Obama for America" logos for
a-parking lot filled with "Super Conserva-
tive" and "Screw the IRS" bumper stickers

LEADERS

a week of daily stories

ew Ann Arbor residents know that
The Statement, the Daily's weekly
news magazine, is named in memo-
ry of the Port Huron Statement, drafted by
myself as the founding document of Students
for a Democratic Society 50 years ago.
This week, the University will host a con-
ference to explore the' legacy of what many
Ann Arbor students birthed half a century
ago.
The vision of the Port Huron Statement
lives on. The first principle of last year's
Occupy Wall Street movement was a call for
participatory democracy, the guidingconcept
of the Port Huron Statement.
From SDS to Occupy, students have led
movements demanding a voice. We believed
in not just an electoral democracy, but also
in direct participation of students in their
remote-controlled universities, of employees
in workplace decisions, of consumers in the
marketplace, of neighborhoods in develop-
ment decisions, family equality in place of
Father Knows Best and online, open source
participation in a world dominated by com-
puterized systems of power.
The Port Huron Statement represented the
dawn of an era, which began with the student
sit-in movement and the Beat Generation, and
didn't end until 1975, with the fall of Richard
Nixon and Saigon.
Students in Ann Arbor played a leading
role in defining this era. One year after gradu-
ating from the University, where I edited The
Michigan Daily, I drafted the 25,000 word
Port Huron Statement that served as a mani-
festo for "participatory democracy," which
initially came to us from a University faculty
adviser, Arnold Kaufman. The Students-for a
Democratic Society founder, Al Haber, fos-
tered a hotbed of debate between 1961 and
1963, before our vision came to fruition in
Berkeley's Free Speech Movement and the
first national Vietnam teach-ins organized at
the University.
Ann Arbor was also a central site of the
New Frontier. University students, myself
included, approached Sen. John F. Kennedy
in October 1960 to request that he endorse
international service as an alternative to the
military draft. He read our letter and, over
worries from his advisers, proposed the
Peace Corps on the steps of the Michigan
Union that night.
As an example of what might have been,
President Lyndon Johnson proposed a "Great
Society ... where men are more concerned
with the quality of their goals than the quan-
tity of their goods," at a 1964 University com-
mencement address. The author of LBJ's
speech, Richard Goodwin, credited the Port
Huron Statement as being a major influence.
Goodwin later wrote a note "to Tom Hayden,
who ... without knowing it inspired the Great
Society," referring to participatory democ-

racy and the administration's anti-poverty
programs.
JFK's assassination staggered us, but his
signing of the nuclear test ban treaty before
his death gave made us hope for a thaw
in the Cold War arms race, which almost
obliterated millions during the Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis.
I left graduate school at the University in
summer 1964 to begin community organizing
in the slums of Newark, N.J. About 200 SDS
activists and I planned to devote our lives to
a nationwide equivalent of the Mississippi
Summer Project. I believed that "an interra-
cial movement of the poor" could empower
a new constituency demanding jobs and eco-
nomic equality.
The United Auto Workers, which was
led by Walter Reuther, gave us the Port
Huron Conference Center courtesy of a

Soviet Union now was plotting to take over
the world. Small countries like Vietnam were
seen as pawns in this global plot. Peace and
civil rights groups at home, even leaders
like Dr. King, were surveilled as The Enemy
Within.
The Port Huron Statement challenged all
that, proposing nuclear de-escalation and
disarmament. We did this not because we
were "pro-Communist" but because we knew
that militarized and unbalanced anti-Com-
munism would divert America's attention
away from our needs at home.
In 1961, the eminent professor Robert
Angell told me soothingly over breakfast that
I could trust Kennedy's new defense, sec-
retary, Robert McNamara - he called him
Bob - because he was "one of us," a liberal
intellectual who lived just off Geddes Ave-
nue and drove into his Ford Motor office in

ing his presidential campaign, there were
184,000 Americans deployed to Vietnam by
late 1965.
Nothing turned out as I once imagined.
There was one constant: the tides of move-
ments and counter-movements kept churn-
ing. Movements based on participatory
democracy eventually gained some mean-
ingful reforms: voting rights for southern
black people and 18-year olds, the fall of two
presidents, amnesty for 50,000 war resisters
in Canada, the Freedom of Information Act,
democratic reforms of the presidential pri-
mary systems, collective bargaining rights
for public employees and farmworkers, the
Roe v. Wade decision, the Clean Air, Clean
Water, and Endangered Species acts, a long
list of reforms gained in less than a decade.
Social change did occur, precious inch by
bloody inch, becoming sacred ground that
had to be protected, decade after decade,
from both reaction and oblivion.
Underlying all of this tumultuous history
lay the rocky river of participatory democ-
racy - "the river of my people" - which kept
flowing.
Now, to paraphrase Port Huron, we are the
elders of this generation looking uncomfort-
ably to the world we leave behind as inheri-
tance. The reforms we achieved are under
constant assault from the right and stagnat-
ing with the passage of time.
"The Port Huron
Statement represented
the golden dawn of the
era of the '60s, which
began with the student
sit-in movement and the
Beat Generation, and
didn't end until 1975,
with the fall of Richard
Nixon and Saigon."
We are in the process of a new beginning,
signaled by the deep American discontent
with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the
threat of more wars to come and the immense
diversion of trillions of tax dollars from our
needs at home for health care and affordable
education. Like the '60s, another imperial
presidency is on the rise, unleashing covert
military operations in multiple countries
without serious congressional oversight or
civic awareness. Like the '60s, the long war
leaves greater economic inequality and envi-

The UAW also donated funds to the SDS

as major resources for Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., the United Farm Workers and the
early activists of what became the Nation-
al Organization for Women. In that brief
period, our hoped-for coalition seemed to
be coming together.
The final sentence of the Statement
warned, however, that "If we appear to seek
the unattainable, let it be known that we do
so to avoid the unimaginable." The unimagi-
nable was about to happen.

Hanoi, a claim he privately knew to be false.

I've never met Mitt Romney
PERSONAL STATEMENT by Andrew Weiner

Politics at the diner
by Zach Bergson

I've never met Mitt Romney. He might have
noticed me in Iowa when he took the stage
in the middle of a manufacturing plant
during the hellish slap-fest that Republicans
called "primary season." The GOP nominee
might' have seen me standing there, silently
judging the conservatives I was packed in with.
To call the audience shoulder-to-shoulder
would be an understatement. It was really
more of a mosh pit around a stage - a boring,
all white, mostly stationary mass of people who
probably didn't know what "mosh pit" meant
and would surely disapprove of the term if they
knew, but a mosh pit nonetheless.
The signature anger was there. A round
woman in light jeans made passive-aggressive
comments behind me to her husband, whisper-
ing, "you'd think someone so tall would have
been courteous and stood in the back," just
purposefully loud enough for me to hear. Or
maybe she thought my ears were so high up the
words wouldn't travel. You'd think someone so
short would have gotten there earlier.
Mitt barreled onto stage 30 minutes late. (A
true diva knows how to keep an audience wait-
ing and anxious.) A long, slow ramp resembling
a runway took Romney from a staging area
into the warehouse-like space the thousand
spectators were corralled into. His sons and
wife, Ann, were waiting for him on a circular
stage at the end of the ramp. A Bieber-fever like
reaction erupted from the crowd at the sight of
their hero, their answer to the evil man who
singlehandedly ruined the America they once
knew and loved - but still believed could be
great again.
After being slowed by hundreds of hands
reaching out to touch their messiah and feel

what made his skin holier than thou, Mitt
reached his handsome family, who, for some
reason, seemed surprised to see him. "Honey!"
I imagined Ann exclaiming, "Are all these peo-
ple - are they here to see you?"
The crowd fell silent at their president's
request. It seemed silly to address him as any-
thing else. We call past presidents by their title,
so why not future ones?
I've never met Mitt Romney. In fact, I'm
almost positive he didn't notice me that flat
Iowa evening. Amid the sea of white, I hadn't
noticed that the short woman had wedged her-
self past me only to realize she was still shorter
than the near-40 people who stood between
her and the stage that the Romneys' actual,real
feet were touching. She must have still wished
to trade bodies with one of the folks whose
longest finger touched the cuff of Mitt's jeans
during his catwalk up. Still, by the transitive
property of mosh pit bodies, she was on stage
with him. I hope she couldn't see a damn thing.
I've never met Mitt Romney. Over the course
of the last year or so, I've read tens of thousands
of words about him - most by people who have
only heard his voice through a speaker system.
But I've never had a conversation with the
man. Not now, and not before he was a world-
touring celebrity.
On Aug. 21, People magazine interviewed
his then-new running mate, Paul Ryan. "Any
low-brow pleasures, like 'The Real House-
wives?' " the interviewer asked him. I don't
like People magazine. Maybe previously I'd
have said "hate," but I have since learned the
word should be reserved for things that actu-
ally make the world a significantly worse place.
I hate oil spills. People may make some read-

ers insecure about their bodies, but it certainly
isn't worth hating. It's mostly just creepy.
I understand the entertainment industry's
economy is dependent on the market forces of
"celebrity." But it's strange that hundreds of
thousands of people care what a person they've
never met, and can statistically reason never
will, named their child or wore while ordering
tacos.
I've never met Barack Obama. I saw the
president when he came to Ann Arbor in Janu-
ary. He seems like a nice guy. By most accounts
he is. His smile doesn't look like it was surgi-
cally implanted on a chiseled stone fade and
masks post-surgery pain. Barack Obama didn't
ask Republicans to campaign on what has to be
the most money ever spent in human history
to ruin one man's reputation. But neither did
Mitt Romney. They're both playing along, sure,
most politicians are - but this can't be the race
either respectable man wanted.
Yes, the 47-percent comment was bad, and
it's difficult to fault those who don't pay much
in federal taxes for worrying about a Romney
presidency. Yes, Republicans rake in - more
contributions from big business. Yes, their
policy reflects less concern about U.S. income
inequality, but it's a stretch to take the gaffe
as more than another in the echo chamber. In
September, Sen. John McCain said the best
advice he had for the candidates is to stay rest-
ed: "Don't get so fatigued that you lose your
temper or say something stupid." Get some
rest, gentlemen.
We've circled back to a national mood where
gut feeling based on likeability or lies has
replaced numbers, experts and logic - and
party politics encourages such substitutions.

It's not that expensive to convince the unin-
formed to vote for their favorite pair of celebri-
ties. It's creepy that Joe Biden can't eat an ice
cream cone without 17 news outlets forsak-
ing traditional fact checking to be the first to
report the red-to-pink-sprinkle ratio.
Like People magazine, America will still be
here in 2016. Our president has not ruined our
country. The Obama administration - which
consists of thousands of highly intelligent
people, not a single man controlling every deci-
sion - hasn't fixed every American ailment.
If they did, it'd be unprecedented; on a macro
level, four years is four minutes. And contrary
to conventional liberal sentiment, if elected,
Mitt Romney will not ruin the country. Amer-
ica isn't on its deathbed, and it would take far
longer than four years, botched or otherwise,
to land there.
America deserves better than a People
magazine election. Mitt Romney and Barack
Obama deserve better than having their basic
moral character judged as a lazy alternative to
their policy - by voters who really don't know
them fundamentally as people and never will.
There are highly intelligent Republicans. There
are highly intelligent Democrats. Both deserve
better than blanket hatred and dismissal.
I've never met Mitt Romney. I certainly dis-
agree with many of his policy positions, and
I'm probably not going to vote for him. But a
bad guy? Months ago, standing in that Iowa
warehouse, I looked at him and said, "Yes, a
bad guy." In hindsight, I was standing way too
far from that stage to see a thing.

The city of Ann Arbor is as liberal as it
gets. Ann Arbor hasn't had a Republi-
can mayor in 12 years, and the last time
the city voted for a Republican president was
back in 1984.Even in the 10-person city coun-
cil, a Republican hasn't held office since 2003.
Despite Tree City's liberal voting record,
it's difficult to put in words what drives Ann
Arbor's voting decisions. Is it the city's liber-
al-minded atmosphere? Background? Educa-
tion? Upbringing? But what about Ann Arbor
residents who aren't affiliated with the Univer-
sity? Are they driven by the same issues that
University students and faculty hold dear? In
an election that has been so focused on larger-
than-life figures and intricate policies, these
questions often go unasked. Sometimes it's
easy to forget that, in the end, this election will
be decided by ordinary people.
Without administering a Gallup poll, I
thought the clearest barometer of the Ann
Arbor psyche could be found at Fleetwood
Diner. Open 24/7, Fleetwood acts as a micro-
cosm of this city, where students, faculty
and townies gather to trade stories and dis-
cuss issues. At any time of the day, you can
find all walks of life eating "Hippie Hash" in
Fleetwood's tiny, greasy, sticker-filled space.
I thought spending time talking to patrons at
Fleetwood could give me the closest thing to
a random sample poll of Ann Arbor residents.

Travis Hughes and Grace Trinidad are both
enrolled in the University's School of Public
Health. Hughes has blond hair and blue eyes
and sports a white and blue beanie on his
head. Trinidad has dark hair and is wearing a
brown-suede jacket adorned with fluffy white
wool.
Hughes is from Oklahoma, a state he says
is as "red as it gets." He went to a Christian
school and grew up in a very socially conserva-
tive environment. But Hughes says he has defi-
nitely drifted away from his Republican roots.
"I think there are a lot of sincere people
in Oklahoma who believe deeply in faith and
freedom and all of these things that are entan-
gled with politics," he says. "There's definitely
a cozy relationship between faith and politics
that is unhealthy."
Prior to coming to Ann Arbor, Hughes
worked for a Tea Party think tank. Joining up
with an organization that he disagreed with
fundamentally, he says, was the only way to
get involved in policy in Oklahoma.
"I was never a Tea Party faithful; I was
always a closet Democrat," he says. "(The
Republican party) is the only place you can do
policy work in Oklahoma."
Hughes and Trinidad are firmly in the
Obama camp. Trinidad points to Obama's
health care law as a major selling point for her
in making her decision, especially since she's
going into public health.
Despite their firm support of Obama, both
of them say they have become disillusioned
with the president.
"Sometimes I think it would be better if
Romney won because I think people would get
pissed off enough that they would actually do
something," Hughes explains.

reminding them to register and emphasize the
civic duty that everyone has to vote, they say.
