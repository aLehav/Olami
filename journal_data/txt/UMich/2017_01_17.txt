According to author Claudia 

Rankine, the inception of her 
book-length 
poem, 
“Citizen: 

An American Lyric,” began 
with the question: “How did 
that happen?” Something of an 
investigation, the poem opens 
with secondhand prose poetry 
cataloguing the lived experience 
of racism among Rankine’s 
friends and colleagues.

“I just wanted to see if people 

were sensitive to the fact that 
every day in small ways, they 
were themselves engaged in 
actions that were annihilating 
other people’s human rights, 
their rights to be here as a 

citizen and as a person in the 
world,” Rankine said in a phone 
interview with the Michigan 
Daily.

As part of the Martin Luther 

King Day Symposium, Claudia 
Rankine, 
poet, 
professor 

and MacArthur fellow, will 
present on “Citizen” published 
in 2014. The event will take 
place in Rackham auditorium, 
hosted by the U-M Racism 
Lab. “Citizen” is the first and 
only book of poetry to ever be 
named on the New York Times 
nonfiction bestseller list as well 
as the recipient of the NAACP 
award and PEN Open Book 
Award. The poem explores 
the brutal lived experience of 
structural racism against Black 

More than 100 people gathered 

in the freezing rain Monday 
afternoon on the Diag for the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
Symposium’s 11th annual Circle 
of Unity, an event intended to 
celebrate Dr. King’s dedicated to 
racial justice, nonviolence, and 
unity. 

The Circle of Unity consisted 

of several performances, from a 
dance circle led by Detroit native 
Julie Beutel and Joe Reilly, a 
University of Michigan alum, 
to renditions of “Lean on Me” 
and “We Shall Overcome” led 
by the Smile Bringer Singers, a 
University club, all designed to get 
the audience to participate.

Event 
organizer 
Amani 

Echols, an LSA sophomore, was 
encouraged by the number of 
people that attended the event 
despite the rain.

“On a smaller level, within 

our learning community, we 
sometimes don’t always have the 
best turnout to all of our events, 
and I really think this shows that 
people really are interested,” 
she said. “So I just hope this on 
a small scale will trickle down 
into bigger things, people just 
going out of their way to help out 
unexpectedly.”

Reilly, has performed at the 

Circle of Unity for the past five 
years, agrees that the event has 
grown over the years. Referring 
to the upcoming inauguration of 
President-elect Donald Trump, 

Reilly noted that this Circle of 
Unity felt different from past ones.

“The circle has gotten bigger,” 

he said. “And I think this year 
it’s in a new context with the 
political changes happening in 
this country. It takes on a new 
meaning, a deeper sense of 
urgency and importance that we 
recognize and celebrate diversity, 
that we are inclusive and that we 
support one another.”

Echols also lauded the ability 

of the event to forge connections 
between 
different 
University 

organizations and within groups 
such as the Michigan Community 
Scholars Program.

“A lot of times the people we 

reach out to have connections 

within our program, so it’s 
always been a way for us to come 
together through our different 
organizations,” she said. “And I 
know David Schoem, the director 
of our learning community, is 
really big on unifying events 
and inclusion, so it seems a 
little cheesy, but the whole in-a-
circle-holding-hands-dancing is 
something he really likes.”

She added despite the novelty 

of the event, she still preferred 
it to a lecture or another event 
that did not include audience 
involvement.

“There are so many events, 

but I like this one especially 
with the theme this year being 
sounds of change, and all of our 

performances are music and 
dance,” she said. “It’s different 
because we’re in a circle, moving 
around, and most of the other 
events are in an auditorium 
listening to a speaker.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Audrey 
Henry 
attended 
the 

performance and agreed the 
unique format of the event fit well 
with Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
legacy.

“I think that Martin Luther 

King Day is about people realizing 
that we’re all one unified group 
of Americans, and of just people 
in the world,” she said. “So all 
coming together in one circle 
kind of represents what Martin 
Luther King stood for.”

In conjunction with Martin 

Luther King Jr. Day festivities 
and 
lectures, 
approximately 

25 students and community 
members marched through Ann 
Arbor to protest the upcoming 
inauguration of President-elect 
Donald Trump. The protest, 
organized by the University of 
Michigan chapter of BAMN 
— 
the 
Coalition 
to 
Defend 

Affirmative Action, Integration 
and Immigrant Rights and Fight 
for Equality By Any Means 
Necessary 
— 
predominantly 

opposed Trump’s plans to change 
immigration reform.

BAMN 
frequently 
hosts 

protests 
on 
campus. 
Most 

recently, BAMN held a protest in 
response to ethnic intimidation 
attacks 
on 
campus 
since 

Trump was elected president. 
Additionally, in early 2014 and 
again in 2015, eight BAMN 
protesters were arrested at a 
University Board of Regents 
meeting after demanding the 
University 
exercise 
on-site 

admissions at Detroit schools.

The Leaders and the 
Rest

WHAT: This exhibit will 
examine who belongs at the 
University of Michigan and 
who draws its boundaries by 
showcasing student expression, 
politics and culture.

WHO: LSA Bicentennial Theme 
Semester

WHEN: 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.

WHERE: Hatcher Graduate 
Library, Room 100

This year’s North American 

International 
Auto 
Show 

attendees went to the annual 
showcase in the hopes of getting 
a closer look at manufacturers’ 
latest offerings — primarily 
eye-catching 
concept 
cars 

encapsulating ideas that may be 
present in vehicles of the future.

The University of Michigan 

was represented at the show, 
held in Detroit’s Cobo Center, by 
the Solar Car Team, the Hybrid 
Racing Team and the Mobility 
Transformation 
Center. 
The 

Solar Car and Hybrid Racing 
Teams had their 2015 and 2016 
vehicles on display.

Engineering junior Jonathan 

Cha, operations director of the 
Solar Car Team, said the auto 
show offers all team members 

an opportunity to interact with 
leaders in the industry.

“Our team has displayed the 

car and presented at the North 
American International Auto 
Show for over 10 years,” he 
said. “We participate mainly 
for the exposure it brings to 
our team, but this year, with 
the AutoMobili-D event, we 
were given a huge networking 
opportunity, which we took full 
advantage of.”

Cha 
also 
explained 

presenting at the auto show 
serves as a bonding event for 
the group, helping to build team 
morale.

“Different 
members 
who 

normally do not interact in such 
a large team get the opportunity 
of spending time with one 
another,” Cha said. “They drive 
together to Detroit and spend 
multiple-hour shifts socializing 
and exploring the auto show.”

Both team’s vehicles were 

displayed in the downstairs 
portion of the Cobo Center — 
an area dedicated primarily 
to 
displaying 
innovations 

in the industry — and were 
grouped 
with 
suppliers 

and 
other 
complements 

to 
the 
manufacturers 
in 

the 
AutoMobili-D 
exhibit. 

The 
exhibit 
also 
featured 

expositions related to electrified 
propulsion, hybrid propulsion 
and autonomous driving.

Engineering senior Brandon 

Hoffman, 
Hybrid 
Racing 

Team 
captain, 
echoed 
the 

importance of using the show as 
a networking event.

“We actually did make a 

couple of really good contacts 
there,” he said. “This one 
company that’s looking to help 
us out with some software for 
next 
year. 
Another 
contact 

we might be talking to about 

some lithium ion batteries 
so it ended up being pretty 
productive. It was good to get 
the car out there and show it 
off to a lot of people from the 
industry that were there.”

The 
Mobility 

Transformation 
Center 

participated 
in 
the 

AutoMobili-D 
event, 

displaying 
an 
autonomous 

Lincoln MKZ. MTC Deputy 
Director Carrie Morton said 
despite automakers releasing 
new models at the Consumer 
Electronics 
Show 
— 
a 

testament to the digitization 
of transportation — the auto 
industry remains aloof.

“I do think that as the 

vehicle becomes simply part 
of the Internet of things, we’re 
going to continue to see this 
trend,” she said. “Do I think 
CES is going to become the 
auto show? I really don’t think 
so. But I do think it is a signal 
of how we — nowadays with 
smartphones—we expect to 
be connected at all times and

Michigan residents who have 

purchased milk or milk products 

since 2003 may be entitled to up 

to $20 thanks to a class action 

settlement.

Fourteen other states and the 

District of Columbia are included 

in the $52 million settlement 

over price fixing of milk and milk 

products, including half-and-half, 

cream cheese, sour cream, cottage 

cheese and yogurt.

Depending on the number 

of products and the number of 

submitted claims, individuals 

may receive between $10 and $20; 

entities or small businesses may 

receive between $140 and $560.

To be eligible, the products 

must have been purchased from a 

grocery store or other retail venue, 

and must not have been purchased 

for resale. No proof of purchase is 

necessary to be eligible.

The case accused dairy 

farmers of prematurely 

slaughtering their cattle and 

reducing herd sizes in order to 

maintain higher product prices.

Half a million cows were 

slaughtered after 3,000 farms 

were bought out. The suit claims 

that the National Milk Producers 

Federation bought out herds of 

cattle, primarily from small farms, 

and slaughtered them early for 

cheap ground beef, thus limiting 

the supply of raw milk and driving 

up prices.

The defendants were 

the National Milk Producers 

Federation. Large cooperatives 

such as Dairy Farmers of America 

Inc., Land O’Lakes Inc. and Agri-

Mark Inc. were also involved as 

well.

The defendants deny the 

allegations that they conspired to 

fix the prices of dairy products but 

decided to settle to avoid a trial.

Americans.

“Reading on Martin Luther 

King Day is always for me, 
an honor, because it puts 
me conversation with one of 
America’s greatest leaders, and 
not only a great leader in terms 
of Civil Rights, but for me he 
is a great leader in terms of 
human rights. He’s an example 
to us all,” Rankine said.

It 
is 
more 
than 
fitting 

that Rankine read on MLK 
day, as her work deals with 
the profound urgency of the 
country’s increasing need for 
humanity and reversal of racist 
policy and practice. The way 
“Citizen” 
challenges 
poetic 

form is inseparable from the 
way it challenges the forms 
of 
oppressive 
sociopolitical 

structures in American society.

The form of the poem is 

deeply interdisciplinary and 
interweaves personal narrative, 
image and news-style evidence. 
One section lists names of 
black Americans whose lives 

were taken by police brutality, 
the words fading from the page 
as the poem progresses. The 
poem is haunting and direct, 
elucidating the ways in which 
the recipients of such constant 
and inhumane treatment wear 
the oppression on their bodies.

As a recipient of a MacArthur 

Genius grant, Rankine will be 
broadening her commitment 
to 
interdisciplinary 
work 

in 
founding 
the 
“Racial 

Imaginary Institute” in New 
York, a gallery space to explore 
race.

“Our 
name 
‘racial 

imaginaries’ is meant to capture 
the enduring truth of race that 
is an invented concept that 
operates with extraordinary 
force 
in 
our 
daily 
lives, 

limiting our movements and 
imaginations. We understand 
that 
perceptions, 
resources, 

rights and minds themselves 
flow along racial lines that 
confront some of us and give 
others unchecked power. These 
lines are drawn and maintained 
by white dominance,” Rankine, 
in describing the work of the 
Institute, said.

Although 
many 
read 

Rankine’s work as a call for 
social change, she explained 
that she does not think that the 
artist’s responsibility to elicit 
a certain reaction or response 
from an audience.

She put it simply: “I’m not 

into any prescriptive definition 
when it comes to being an 
artist.”

The 
book’s 
powerful 

statement on the experience 
of racism in America merges 
the personal and political in 
a way that has resonated with 
both timelessness and an eerie 
timeliness. The text places 
present-day micro-aggressions 
against black lives and beside 
text and images that allude 
to the era of Jim Crow laws, 
all 
culminating 
in 
poetry 

that unleashes something so 
personally 
and 
persistently 

felt.

Near the end of the poem 

Rankine writes, “That time 
and that time and that time 
the outside blistered the inside 
of you, words outmaneuvered 
years, had you in a chokehold, 
every part roughed up, the eyes 

dripping.” In this moment, 
the immensity of history and 
politics upholds a visceral pain 
that is at once personal and 
shared.

In this, the poet makes 

no real distinction between 
artistic intention that is or is 
not political.

“I think that politics are part 

of life so they are unavoidable, 
so we don’t need to go out 
of our way to avoid them or 
engage them,” Rankine said. 
“They’re part of our life, our 
history, our day to day living. 
They determine everything. 
I think writers and artists 
need to do what they do for 
themselves, 
to 
write 
from 

the place of most honesty, 
imaginative, possibility that 
they can envision themselves 
in, but they can’t avoid politics 
whether or not they think 
they’re doing it.” 

Rankine will be appearing 

both at Rackham Auditorium 
Monday evening and at the 
Institute for Social Research 
Tuesday morning where she 
will talk about her ongoing 
research on racism in America.

“I hope the University of 

Michigan will always be known 
for social change,” Schlissel 
said, referring to the recent 
measures 
being 
taken 
on 

campus.

During his tenure, Schlissel 

has worked to foster diversity 
and campus climate through 
initiatives such as 49 individual 
unit plans across all colleges 
and 
academic 
departments 

which aim to increase and 
retain student body diversity. 
Additionally, 
Schlissel 
is 

currently overseeing plans for 
the construction of the new 
Trotter Multicultural Center 
and 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 

Inclusive Teaching Professional 
Development programs, which 
include workshops to improve 
faculty awareness about the new 
initiative that allows students 
to 
update 
their 
designated 

pronouns. These programs 
also are aimed at administering 
classroom evaluation surveys 
to gauge the success of more 
inclusive teaching methods.

Musicology Associate Prof. 

Mark Clague then introduced 
a 
reinterpretation 
of 
the 

national anthem to reflect the 
Symposium’s theme, “Sounds 
of 
Change.” 
Following 
the 

performance, LSA senior Alyssa 
Brandon introduced both of 
the speakers. Brandon has also 
been an editor for the Daily.

Goodman began by talking 

about 
the 
news 
program 

she 
hosts 
and 
highlighted 

the importance of featuring 
different 
perspectives 
and 

people, saying it’s an important 

step 
in 
fostering 
mutual 

understanding.

“When you hear someone 

speaking 
from 
their 
own 

experience, 
it 
challenges 

stereotypes,” Goodman said. 
“That understanding is the 
beginning of peace … which is 
why we have to take the media 
back.”

Goodman, who is known 

for her role in civic activism, 
then spoke about President-
elect Donald Trump’s recent 
feud with U.S. Rep. John Lewis 

(D–Ga.), a civil rights leader, 
head of the Student Nonviolent 
Coordinating 
Committee 
in 

the 1960s and member of the 
“Big Six” — a coalition of civil 
rights leaders that also included 
Martin Luther King Jr. She told 
the audience how she found it 
appalling that the president-
elect could refer to an icon of 
the civil rights movement as “all 
talk, all talk, all talk, no action” 
despite his more than 50-year 
fight for civil rights causes.

“No 
matter 
what 
your 

political persuasion, it is hard 
to describe John Lewis as a 
man who does not take action,” 
Goodman said.

Goodman, 
after 
offering 

her thoughts on contemporary 
political climate, then reflected 
on other figures in the civil 
rights movement, like Rosa 
Parks. She stated that the 
modern image of Parks was that 
of an unwitting activist who 
ignited the modern civil rights 
movement; however, Goodman 
refuted this claim.

“Every network talked about 

her, no question, but they got it 
wrong.” Goodman said. “They 
said Rosa Parks was a tired 
seamstress; that was true. They 
said she was no troublemaker; 
that was wrong. Rosa Parks 
was a first-class troublemaker. 
She knew exactly what she was 
doing. She was an activist, and 
the media denigrates activists.”

Goodman highlighted the 

importance of an independent 
press and reporters that are 
engaged with grassroots social 
movements 
despite 
possible 

obstacles, like governmental 
institutions. To stress this point, 
she shared her experiences 
in North Dakota last year 
when officials issued an arrest 
warrant 
for 
misdemeanor 

criminal 
trespassing 
when 

covering the Dakota Access 
Pipeline protests.

“We need a media that gives a 

voice to all of these movements 
today: the Black Lives Matter 
movement, the environmental 
justice movement, the gay-
lesbian-trans-queer movement, 
the war and peace movement.” 
she said. “That philosophy, 
that motto, should be the 
Hippocratic oath of media today 
— we will not be silent.”

Afterward, 
Rae 
was 

introduced by Brandon, who 
emphasized that though both 
keynote speakers came from 

different 
backgrounds, 
they 

share many experiences. 

When 
asked 
about 
her 

personal history, Rae explained 
moving 
homes, 
attending 

predominantly white schools 
and going to Stanford University 
was much of what inspired her 
current work.

“A lot of those experiences I 

mined for my work now,” Rae 
said. “And a lot of my work now 
focuses on just those feelings of 
being out of place and feeling 
uncomfortable and feeling, you 
know, awkward and insecure.”

In 
addition, 
Rae 
spoke 

about her support for Planned 
Parenthood and how though she 
knows entertainers are reduced 
to just the role of entertaining, 
she believes there’s too much at 
stake for her to not respond.

“The 
attack 
on 
Planned 

Parenthood is so bewildering.” 
Rae said. “When I felt like I 
couldn’t talk to my mother 
about something, that’s where 
I went.”

When asked about what her 

message to the audience would 
be, Rae emphasized that she 
focuses on remaining authentic 
and herself.

“For me, I just want to 

continue being authentic,” she 
said. “I want to come from a 
place of truth always, I’m going 
to make a difference in a way 
that is long-lasting.”

LSA 
freshman 
Griffin 

Gonzales said he found the 
keynote engaging, and felt Issa 
Rae was particularly inspiring.

“I just think it was a very first-

hand account of her experience 

KEYNOTE

senior Keysha Wall, a BAMN 
organizer, the group organizes 
events in the Ann Arbor area 
each year surrounding Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. This year, she 
said, the events are in an effort to 
oppose the policies of Trump that 
they believe are destructive. 

“It’s part of a larger initiative 

to shut down Trump’s racist and 
violent vision for America,” she 
said.

Immigration 
policies 
have 

been at the forefront of Trump’s 
platform 
throughout 
his 

campaign. Much of the concern 
surrounding these policies stems 
from the anticipated repeal of 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals and Deferred Action 
for Parents of Americans and 
Lawful 
Permanent 
Residents 

initiatives, which provide aid 
to 
undocumented 
immigrants 

who arrived in the United States 
as children and parents with 
children who are in the country 
legally. It is expected Trump will 
repeal both policies upon entering 
office.

BAMN organizer Kate Stenvig, 

a University of Michigan alum, 
pointed to the national 2006 
protests for immigration reform, 
in which millions of people 
participated, saying similar action 
must be taken now.

“We need that but much, 

much bigger, because Trump has 
declared war on immigrants,” 
she said. “We have to build that 
immigrant rights, civil rights 
movement to shut down Trump 
and beat him and beat his racist 
movement now.”

In the spirit of Martin Luther 

King Jr. Day, Stenvig said, the 
protest called for “no business as 
usual” until action can be taken 
against Trump. Only those in 
support of this cause were in 
attendance at the protest.

“We’re 
saying 
everything 

should be shut down this week,” 
she said. “Martin Luther King said 
at the March (on Washington) in 
1963 — in his ‘I Have a Dream’ 
speech — he said there would be 
a rude awakening if the country 
returned to business as usual. 
We are saying there should be no 
business as usual until Trump is 
defeated.”

Protesters began at the corner 

of 
South 
University 
Avenue 

and South Forest Street before 
marching 
down 
various 
city 

streets with three police cars 
following the march.

Protesters held signs reading: 

“Open the borders now! No more 
deportations” and “Trump must 
go by any means necessary” along 
with others in a similar vein, and 
chanted phrases including, “No 
Trump. No wall. Full citizenship. 
Rights for all” and “Obama, 
pardon DACA youth now, by any 
means necessary, shut Trump 
down.”

The march ended at the corner 

of North University Avenue and 
State Street, where protesters 
continued to hold up signs and 
individuals voiced their opinions 
to the group.

“Trump 
is 
talking 
about 

destroying the lives of the most 
vulnerable people in this nation,” 
Wall said. “It isn’t just because 
it would be easy because they 
have their information on file, 
it’s because they are the people 
who would be at the forefront of 
destroying his racist, hate-filled, 
violent movement.”

Markeith 
Jones, 
a 
BAMN 

organizer and freshman at Wayne 
State University, said the world is 
at a crossroads in which people 
can choose to organize and build 
a new civilized immigrant rights 
movement or allow a potentially 
fascist regime to take over.

“The time period we’re in 

right now — we’re at a point 
where the world can go either 
way,” he said. “There are two 
sides pushing and pulling. What 
we 
are 
doing 
is 
organizing 

a 
countermovement 
against 

Donald Trump’s movement. If 
we don’t, the alternative is a rise 
of fascism in the United States, 
mass deportations, people being 
dragged out of their houses, 
beaten and killed.”

LSA senior Lauren Kay, who 

was among the protesters, said 
much like how Martin Luther 
King Jr. fought against the 
normalization of discrimination 
against minorities, people must 
fight 
Trump’s 
anti-immigrant 

policies.

“I think the only proper way to 

celebrate MLK Day is to fight and 
is to protest and is to raise hell and 
is to alter people’s consciences and 
consciousness,” she said. “And not 
just have people get trapped in 
normalizing oppression.”

going to throw millions off of 
health insurance, you’ve got 
another guess coming,” Sanders 
said.

Sanders has been one of 

the strongest proponents of 
the health care law, which — 
although it has provided health 
care to about 20 million people 
— has been criticized for its 
high premiums. The senator’s 
rhetoric was aimed toward 
those who may be most affected 
by the repeal — working-class 
individuals and members of 
labor unions, including the 
United Automobile Workers, 
who were a strong presence in 
the crowd.

“Very few Americans want to 

repeal the Affordable Care Act 
without a replacement to make 
it better,” Sanders said.

Kathy Squires, a Chelsea 

resident, came to show support 
for the law, which she says 
saved her daughter’s life.

“My daughter is in remission 

after having cancer and she 
needs continuing care,” she said. 
“I don’t know what’s going to 
happen to her insurance under 
President Trump, so I need to 
be here with other people who 
are hoping for change.”

U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow 

(D–Mich.) said during the rally 
she resonated with the personal 
nature of the health care law. 
She said if we look at all the 
pieces of health care reform, 2 
million people in Michigan will 
lose their health care.

“This isn’t a political issue,” 

she said. “I can’t think of a more 

personal one.”

Shirley Chalmers, a resident 

of Beverly Hills, carried a sign 
at the rally that read, “taking 
away ACA is a death sentence,” 
and said her support for Sanders 
rested largely on his ability to 
mobilize.

“He’s sparking a fire for 

something 
that 
has 
been 

dormant since the election 
season ended,” she said. “Thank 
you, Bernie, for showing the 
way.”

Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D–

Mich.) said mobilization of 
millennials 
is 
necessary 
to 

resist Republican efforts to 
repeal the bill.

“Millennials, 
you 
are 

under attack,” Lawrence said. 
“Millennials, are you ready to 
stand up and fight?”

Sanders agreed that the fight 

to prevent Republicans from 

repealing 
“Obamacare” 
will 

be arduous, but he urged his 
supporters to remain involved.

“This is the beginning of the 

fight, not the end of the fight,” 
Sanders said.

Additionally, 
Planned 

Parenthood 
President 

Cecile 
Richards 
applauded 

“Obamacare” 
for 
its 
part 

in women’s health care in 
particular. 
Under 
President 

Obama’s 
health 
care 
law, 

women’s 
preventive 
care, 

such as mammograms and 
cervical screenings, must be 
covered without cost sharing. 
Richards said with more female 
representation 
in 
Congress, 

more women’s health issues can 
be resolved.

“If there were more people 

in Congress who could get 
pregnant, we could stop arguing 
about birth control,” she said.

this is really just an extension 
of that. The vehicle is just an 
extension of our expectation of 
connectivity at all times.”

Hoffman agreed with the 

gravity of the autonomous car 
revolution.

“It’s probably going to be 

the next big revolution in the 

auto industry,” Hoffman said. 
“It’s on par with the moving 
assembly line.”

Hoffman also weighed in 

on the mixture of old and new 
technology, stating that other 
iconic cars such as the Ford 
Mustang could soon be coming 
out as hybrids.

“I actually think it’s a really 

cool idea, I’d actually like to 
see more of that,” he said,”the 
same styling you get in classic 
cars, but updated components 

that are made to much better 
standards than the cars of that 
time.”

Joe Mathis, an auto show 

patron from Cincinnati, Ohio, 
was confident the high-tech 
features displayed on concept 
cars will eventually migrate into 
mainstream vehicles. Mathis 
also attested to what the show 
does for public understanding 
and awareness regarding the 
auto industry.

“It’s a great jumpstart, kick in 

the arm; it gets people excited 
about the industry,” he said. “It 
brings a lot of people out as you 
can see (and) gets people talking 
about the industry again.”

The 
auto 
industry 
has 

recently 
been 
under 
the 

microscope because of a series 
of tweets from President-elect 
Donald Trump, who applauded 
domestic 
manufacturers 
for 

creating American jobs rather 
than expanding internationally.

rowing up in Midwest 
Ohio, celebrities existed 
only on movie screens. 

They were enigmas, and I thought 
of them more as the 
characters they played 
than who they actually 
were. However, every 
January, I got what 
felt 
like 
an 
inside 

glimpse of Hollywood: 
the Golden Globes. I 
loved watching the 
red-carpet entrances 
on TV, complete with 
awkward interviews, 
extravagant 
dresses 

and a feeling that the people I 
watched in my favorite movies 
were real. But perhaps most of 
all, I enjoyed the acceptance 
speeches: the brief words each 
actor, actress, director or other 
member of the film industry 
would share with the world. 
Acceptance 
speeches 
always 

tended 
to 
be 
heartfelt 
and 

grateful and above all, defied the 
stereotype of celebrities.

You could see it in their faces 

and feel it in their words; these 
people often thought of as rich 
and 
selfish 
were 
passionate 

about what they did and grateful 
for the opportunity. Maybe I’m 
naïve or maybe these people are 
just really good actors. Either 
way, 
acceptance 
speeches 

always felt real. Yet, after recent 
awards shows — in particular, 
last week’s Golden Globes — I 
realize 
acceptance 
speeches 

aren’t just demonstrations of 
celebrities’ acting abilities but 
rather conscious efforts to use 
their fame for something greater.

When I sat down last Sunday 

to watch the Golden Globes, I 
was expecting the same glimpse 
of Hollywood I got every year. 
Instead, the trend of awareness-
raising 
speeches 
continued, 

this time from one of the 
most timeless actresses of our 
generation: Meryl Streep. After 
accepting the Cecil B. DeMille 
lifetime 
achievement 
award, 

Streep took the stage with the 
same gratefulness most actors do. 
But instead of thanking those in 
her Hollywood community who 
helped her along the way, she 
turned to the camera and spoke to 
us all, delivering moving words on 
Donald Trump’s presidency and 
the change all Americans know is 

on the horizon — whether you are 
a Trump supporter or not. Streep 
took a platform — in this case 
at an awards show stage at the 

Beverly Hills Hilton 
Hotel — to call out the 
threatening nature of 
a Trump presidency, a 
presidency she openly 
disagrees with. 

While 
Streep’s 

speech took social 
media by storm the 
next day, she is not 
the only celebrity to 
use an acceptance 
speech for political 

purposes. At last year’s Oscars, 
it seemed as though every 
other 
speech 
was 
used 
to 

raise awareness for something 
the winner felt needed to be 
addressed. The long-awaited win 
for Leonardo DiCaprio for Best 
Actor was met with a powerful 
speech on the enduring effects 
of climate change. But even 
before that, political speeches 
were common at award shows. 
The Washington Post outlined 
some 
memorable 
acceptance 

speeches, including one from 
1973 when Marlon Brando sent 
a young Native American girl 
in his place as to draw attention 
to the discrimination of Native 
Americans by the film industry. 

Many may argue a celebrity’s 

role in politics is ironic; they can 
play characters that experience 
injustices but they themselves 
are 
images 
of 
money 
and 

privilege. Yet, with speeches 
like Streep’s and those before 
her, I find myself comforted 
by the fact these people of 
wealth and privilege are using 
their platforms to speak out. 
After hearing an actress I have 
admired for so long speak 
about a presidency that brings 
uncertainty and fear to the 
institutions and ideals I believe 
in — in particular, the press 
— I was grateful. Whether or 
not celebrities have a place in 
politics isn’t the question; they 
will always have a spotlight 
and their use of it to shed light 
on other issues is powerful, 
possibly more powerful now 
than ever.

Trump responded to Streep’s 

eloquent and strong speech in 
what we now can consider true 
Trump fashion: The president-

elect tweeted, “Meryl Streep, 
one of the most over-rated 
actresses in Hollywood, doesn’t 
know me but attacked last night 
at the Golden Globes …” At this 
point, I shouldn’t be surprised 
by Trump’s tweets, yet they get 
me every time. But perhaps most 
ironic is Streep’s delivery of an 
opposing view to our president-
elect’s. Here is a woman who 
most of us have nothing in 
common with, yet she was able 
to use her Hollywood soapbox 
to translate what many of us 
have been feeling. But even 
more, without once mentioning 
the name of the person behind 
those feelings. And ironically, 
the man she stood up against 
has more in common with her 
than we do.

Trump’s 
presidency 
is 

juxtaposed with his ties to 
Hollywood. A president usually 
becomes a celebrity, but doesn’t 
begin as one. Trump’s past of 
wealth, 
privilege 
and 
fame 

make him more like the Meryl 
Streeps of the world than college 
students like me. But last Sunday 
night proved how fame does 
not always equal ignorance or 
selfishness and that politics are 
not subjected to one group but 
affect us all. For me, Streep’s 
speech was made with concerted 
empathy and thoughtfulness. 
She spoke for many, in particular 
foreigners 
and 
the 
press, 

drawing attention to people 
whose soapboxes may not be as 
tall as her own. I can only wish 
that Trump, whose own fame is 
about to increase exponentially, 
will do the same, except now as 
the leader of our country.

We all have seen the remarkably 

un-presidential 
tweets 
and 

speeches from the president-
elect. Trump’s discourse has 
taken away the elegance and 
power of words in politics. The 
excessive exclamation points 
and defensiveness are a stark 
change from what is expected 
of 
a 
conventional 
public 

official. Yet, with speeches like 
Streep’s, maybe the power of 
the spoken word in politics will 
now come from the places we 
least expect it.

L

ately 
I 
have 
been 

thinking 
about 
race 

more than usual. As 

a 
dark, 
African-American 

woman, it is difficult not 
to think about my race. I 
am constantly aware of my 
complexion. I do not have the 
privilege of being a lighter skin 
tone, blending in or choosing 
which community to belong to. 
The choice had been made for 
me long before I was even born.

Yet, I tried to convince 

myself and the people around 
me 
that 
I 
was 
different 

from 
others 
with 
similar 

complexions. 
I 
so 
strongly 

believed that being African 
American was different from 
being Black. I was frustrated 
and confused by people’s use 
of African American as the 
proper name for the Black race. 
I considered African American 
to be my race and my ethnicity. 
Since I was born in Nigeria 
before my family migrated 
to America, I am a citizen of 
both countries. That was what 
African American meant to 
me. I did not understand why 
people who had lived their 
entire lives in America but had 
dark complexions were also 
called African American.

I tried so hard to separate 

myself 
from 
the 
Black 

community because I knew 
the stereotypes that came with 
embracing my Blackness. I was 
determined to show everyone 
that my African heritage was 
different. I was firm in my 
belief that my complexion did 
not 
symbolize 
oppression, 

but rather the richness of my 
culture. However, my efforts 
felt useless.

I grew increasingly aware 

that the first thing people 
saw was the color of my skin 
and that was all they needed 
to categorize me. I was never 
given the chance to explain my 
African heritage or disprove 
the stereotypes. I started to 
hate my complexion. I wished 
I were lighter or that I could 
blend in. I envied light-skin 
girls who were praised for their 
olive skin tones. It was not until 
I sought out why my skin has 
its color that I re-learned how 
to love my complexion.

I learned that melanin is the 

chemical substance responsible 
for dark skin. Melanin protects 
the 
body 
from 
the 
sun’s 

harmful radiation. In places 
near the equator, like Africa, 
where there is more direct 
sunlight for longer periods, 
more melanin is needed. So my 
beautiful, dark skin protects 
me. In places like Antarctica, 
where there is hardly any direct 
sunlight, too much melanin is 
dangerous and prevents the 
body from absorbing adequate 
sunlight. Some radiation from 
the sun is needed to help the 
body convert substances into 

necessary vitamins, so in such 
places, people adapted fair 
complexions.

Studying 
history 
showed 

me that my ancestors were not 
responsible for the negative 
connotations that come with 
being labeled Black. In fact, 
the idea of race was created to 
rationalize the oppression of 
people with dark complexions. 
One drop of Black lineage was 
enough to claim someone, no 
matter how light their skin 
was, as a slave. Fanshen Cox 
DiGiovanni, an actor and a 
writer, honed into this idea of 
“one drop” in her one-woman 
multimedia performance, “One 
Drop of Love.” She takes her 
audience through the history of 
the U.S. census to discover the 
perception of race over time.

My 
anthropology 
class 

further 
emphasized 
the 

creation of race and defined it 
as a social construct. Race was 
created to categorize members 
of 
society 
and 
vindicate 

unequal treatment. Yet, the 
negative history of race does 
not mean we can ignore it 
when claiming our identities. 
Analyzing 
race 
in 
Brazil 

changed my perception even 
more. In Brazil, I learned in 
class, race is flexible. Your race 
is based on your personality, 
your family and how you self-
identify. I thought Brazil’s 
notions of race were superior 
to America’s, but then I took 
yet another look at race.

I learned that public health 

acknowledges the importance 
of race categories and considers 
race to be a social determinant 
of 
health. 
Then 
I 
started 

looking at the statistics. The 
facts are unnerving: Blacks face 
more adverse health effects 
in almost every category. I 
was enraged when I found out 
that a college-educated, Black 
woman of high social class 
is three times more likely to 
have a preterm birth than an 
uneducated, 
white 
woman. 

Then I realized the problem is 
so much bigger than how we 
self-identify. The fact is, Blacks 
are subject to health disparities 
before they are even born.

Up until that point, I aspired to 

be a physician so I could tackle the 
problems sickle cell patients face. 
I thought finding a cure would 
solve all of their problems. Now I 
realize that a cure is not enough. I 
have to address the fact that sickle 
cell anemia is considered a “Black 
disease.” As a minority, I must 
tackle the racial disparities that 
accompany the disease before I 
can focus on a cure. 

I realized that my skin, just 

like that of many sickle cell 
patients, 
would 
forever 
be 

perceived as dark and therefore 
I would be categorized as Black. 
I cannot see my racial typology 
negatively, however. I have to 
understand and acknowledge 

the history of my race. Black is 
not just a self-identifier, but a 
political identity that has had 
systemic 
ramifications. 
My 

choice in identifying as Black 
has allowed me to reclaim that 
identity on my own terms.

I 
finally 
came 
to 
the 

conclusion that I am Black and 
African American. Accepting 
both identities has allowed me 
to open myself up to the Black 
community. I began to reach 
out to the Black communities 
on 
campus 
and 
actively 

participating in events. I made 
it my mission to find a home 
for myself within the Black 
community 
and 
convinced 

myself that I had finally come 
full circle with my perception 
of my race.

Attending 
DiGiovanni’s 

performance 
showed 
me, 

however, that I had still been 
trying to distinguish myself 
from the community I was 
seeking acceptance from. Last 
year, I began to call myself a 
Nigerian American because I 
was sick of explaining what I 
meant by African American. 
Fanshen’s 
show 
helped 
me 

realize what I was doing. Her 
performance takes the audience 
through her life struggles to find 
out what race she belongs to as a 
mixed woman. Growing up she 
was constantly asked: “what are 
you?” The question often made 
her feel excluded, but upon 
reflection she realized a certain 
privilege that comes with being 
able to answer that question.

Fanshen made me realize 

that I, too, have a certain 
privilege 
as 
an 
African 

American. Although I belong 
to a minority race, I have 
the ability to define African 
American as it relates to who 
I am. I can trace my lineage 
back to Nigeria and I know, 
without a doubt, that hundreds 
of generations of my family 
were born in the same nation as 
I was. I am privileged that my 
family came to America on its 
own terms.

We are so often engulfed 

by our adversities that we do 
not recognize where we have 
an advantage. Acknowledging 
my fortunes as well as my 
hardships 
has 
helped 
me 

embrace my identities and 
better understand who I am. I 
am not merely one thing. I am 
a Black, Nigerian, American 
woman with sickle cell anemia. 
Still, I am much more than that. 
I will continue to share my 
story no matter how hard it is 
in hopes of educating, inspiring 
or touching at least one person 
because, like Fanshen says, all 
it takes is “one drop of love.”

Finding your partner in the Tinder Era 

ZACHARY COX | COLUMN

T

echnology 
has 

revolutionized the manner 
in which people pursue 

romantic 
and 
sexual 
partners, 

particularly for college 
students. 
Many 
on 

campus 
choose 
to 

utilize Tinder, a dating 
application that displays 
photos of the individual 
and a brief description to 
a user, who then chooses 
whether or not they are 
interested. This creates 
a unique space, free 
of competition from 
others, where a person 
can privately view prospective 
dates or sexual partners without 
having to feel the pressure or sense 
of competition that exists at parties 
or in bars.

However, Tinder also creates 

a 
space 
that 
provides 
new 

opportunities for people to be 
objectified and rude, often in a 
sexual context. With this new 
space comes a new responsibility 
for us to extend the same kindness 
and polite nature online as we 
would in person. Moreover, this 
new space, while an excellent 
tool 
to 
generate 
face-to-face 

interaction, should not entirely 
replace the old-fashioned effort of 
approaching someone in person. 
Face-to-face interaction is the best 
way to build interpersonal skills 
that will serve us in all areas of life, 
be it in the professional context, in 
romance or in friendship.

Many 
can 
relate 
to 
the 

experience of having to compete 
to speak to someone whom they 
find attractive. Matching with 
someone on Tinder allows one to 
approach unimpeded by others. 
Furthermore, they are able to 
rehearse their first line to an 
infinite degree. However, it also 
takes away the ability to read 
the verbal or bodily response 
to what is first said, making 
the clarity of communication 
all the more important. Still, 
with the somewhat anonymous 

nature of the Tinder interface, 
communicative mistakes are not 
permanent. That “Hey cutie how 
are you doing?” message that you 

sent two months ago 
to your first match 
likely 
won’t 
follow 

you anywhere, though 
your first match may 
not 
have 
thought 

much of you with such 
a message. 

Once 
you 
match 

with 
someone, 
the 

next 
step 
in 
the 

process is to send the 

first message. Regardless 

of your end goal, be it a one-night 
stand, relationship or something in 
between, you must show interest 
in a polite manner, steering clear 
of commentary that is overtly 
sexual in nature. Everyone wants 
and deserves respect, so sending a 
message detailing what you would 
like to “do” with your match right 
off the bat may not be the best way 
to get your desired response.

You must not drop the chivalry 

of the well-mannered man who 
holds the door open for others 
simply because you are hidden 
behind a screen. Look through 
the bio of your match and try to 
find something interesting, or 
something you have in common. 
Perhaps you realize you have the 
same major or are from the same 
town. That may be a better place 
to start the conversation, even if 
your goal is to end with sex. People 
appreciate others who care to get 
to know and learn a little bit about 
them, even if they aren’t interested 
in a long-term relationship.

Once you become skilled at 

connecting with people virtually, 
doing so in person may become 
vastly 
less 
appealing. 
Why 

bother to approach that person 
at the party when you can invite 
the one you matched with on 
Tinder? If we depend solely 
on pictures and 500-character 
descriptions to get to know 
people, are we really developing 

our interpersonal skills? When 
you have a conversation with 
someone in person, you can’t 
pause and consult the internet 
to find information about the 
person’s interests to come up with 
a subject to talk about, or how to 
respond to a remark they make.

For us to be capable of 

successfully building stronger 
relationships 
with 
others, 
it 

is vital that we extend our 
vocabulary of words, actions and 
emotions beyond the cell phone. 
These skills extend beyond the 
realm of romance and dating. 
In a job interview, you cannot 
consult 
Google 
when 
asked 

about sales strategy or how you 
would approach a management 
consulting case. You need to 
build your skills in learning how 
to respond in real time in an 
effective manner.

And 
in 
the 
context 
of 

relationships, 
you 
truly 
get 

to 
know 
a 
person 
through 

spending physical time with 
them, not by studying some of 
their interests on a social media 
profile. Spending physical time 
with people reveals the little 
behavioral tendencies and their 
peculiarities, such as the way 
they set a table to eat or how they 
fold laundry. These are not things 
that you can learn by perusing 
what they’ve liked on Facebook.

While we may have our own 

personal motives for approaching 
people, be it friendship, romance 
or sex, it is unlikely we will 
have this desire reciprocated 
by the other person if we do not 
demonstrate a genuine interest 
in them. When you find yourself 
at a party or bar and see someone 
you would like to talk to, do 
it. Don’t hesitate and don’t be 
afraid. If you fail, it is unlikely 
that 
you’ll 
be 
remembered. 

You have nothing to lose, and 
everything to gain.

and for people of color.


“Live by Night,” the latest 

film from writer-director-actor 
Ben Affleck (“Argo”), stumbles 
in its opening minute. In a sepia 
montage of his World War I 
service, Affleck’s Joe Coughlin 
reveals that his experience in 
the terrible European war taught 
him not that violence is bad, but 
that he should fundamentally 
distrust rules. That’s really all 
we know of Coughlin, besides 
his Irish origin and that he has a 
police chief for a father (Brendan 
Gleeson, “Calvary”). He became 
a 
gangster 
— 
a 
relatively 

powerful one at that (though 
the extent and mechanics of his 
success is rather oblique) — in 
prohibition-era Boston. Little 
internal conflict, little moral 
struggle. Just breaking the rules. 
It’s not really a motive, but it’s an 
excuse for Affleck to have a lot 
of fun behind and in front of the 
camera.

Breaking the rules means a 

lot of killing, appropriate for 
a gangster movie. Coughlin 
moves from Boston to Florida 
to escape his rival gangster, 
Albert White (Robert Glenister, 
“Close to the Enemy”), enraged 
at Coughlin for an affair with 
his mistress, Emma (Sienna 
Miller, “Foxcatcher”). In Ybor 
City, outside of Tampa, he 
works in a rum business run by 
Italian Mafioso Maso Pescatore 
(Remo Girone, “La Piovra”), 
all the while looking to expand 
into gambling in Sarasota once 
prohibition inevitably ends. He’s 
reunited with his old partner, 
Dion (Chris Messina, “Cake”), 
and finds love in Graciela (Zoe 
Saldana, “Star Trek Beyond”), 
whose brother runs a business 
in the area. Coughlin maneuvers 
around the local police chief 
(Chris Cooper, “Demolition”), 

whose brother-in-law (Matthew 
Maher, 
“Gone 
Baby 
Gone”) 

works in the Ku Klux Klan 
and whose daughter Loretta 
(Elle Fanning, “20th Century 
Women”) goes off to Hollywood 
but 
becomes 
an 
anti-vice 

Christian preacher, throwing a 
wrench in Coughlin’s plans.

Confused 
yet? 
It’s 
only 

natural, given the sheer density 
of the plot. But 
even complicated 
stories can entice 
the 
audience, 

revealing 
details 

slowly 
and 

methodically. 
“Live 
by 
Night” 

fails 
on 
this 

front, 
revealing 

details 
quickly, 

all at once and 
without 
building 

up. Affleck, who 
adapted 
Dennis 

Lehane’s novel of the same 
name, uses extensive voice over 
by Coughlin as a crutch; he 
blandly outlines his motives and 
the ensuing events, but with so 
little clarity that fundamental 
names and faces are left unclear, 
even at the end. Affleck seems 
more concerned with getting to 
the elaborate set pieces (which 
themselves 
are 
beautifully 

crafted, though often times 
confusing for those following 
along), but he forgot to show 
what they mean.

And that’s a problem when 

the 
film 
is 
fundamentally 

a 
dialogue-heavy 
movie 

masquerading as a gangster 
action film. Take the romance 
between Emma and Joe that 
propels the opening of the film. 
We learn rather quickly the two 
are together, aided by Harry 
Gregson-Williams’s 
(“The 

Martian”) lush score, but we feel 
nothing for them. They’re just in 
a secretive relationship, devoid 
of any true passion that we can 
discern from the screen, aside 

from furious kissing.

The film’s reliance on dialogue 

and voice over to reveal key bits 
of information is complicated by 
a litany of sound issues: first, that 
the sound mixing itself is rather 
poor, so the characters’ words 
aren’t very clear; and second, 
that “Live by Night” takes place 
during the melting pot era of 
immigration, but before the 

actual 
melting 

itself — the wildly 
varying 
accents 

are 
strong 
and 

it takes work to 
adjust as rapidly 
as the screenplay 
demands. 
And 

Affleck’s camera, 
in those heavy-
dialogue 
scenes, 

has little sense 
of 
placement. 

Every 
cut 
is 

a 
distraction, 

slightly off-putting, which can 
increase tension but decreases 
comprehension.

Ben Affleck, whose directorial 

work to date has been a success, 
is just not as great as an actor. 
His 
voice, 
a 
monotonous 

extended vocal fry adorned with 
a strangely somewhat modern 
Boston accent, delivers lines 
reliably but with no emotional 
support or sense of spontaneity. 
There’s 
nothing 
that 
feels 

truly alive in the film, albeit 
beautifully rendered.

There is something special 

about this film, though. At those 
few moments when ’20s cars’ 
engines are roaring and Tommy 
guns are blaring, scored by 
music that sounds like a swarm 
of bees taking vengeance on a 
hive heckler, “Live by Night” 
comes alive. And a sun-soaked 
gangster-laden Florida on the 
verge 
of 
massive 
economic 

expansion mixed with rapidly 
changing 
demographics, 
a 

strange rarity in cinema history, 
is enchanting visual candy.

“The Young Pope” is HBO’s 

newest original series that, 
in 
accordance 
with 
HBO’s 

niche, flirts with themes of 
disturbia and abuse of power. 
This time, however, it does so 
in a manner that takes on the 
heart of religion itself. In what 
is possibly Jude Law’s (“The 
Holiday”) 
most 
outlandish 

performance, 
he 
portrays 

a youthful Pope Pius XIII. 
Perhaps the most frightening 
aspect of this new drama is 
just how disturbing change can 
feel in a place untouched by the 
ages. After watching just an 
episode, I’m unsure whether 
I should continue with the 
series or consider returning to 
church.

Despite the backwardness 

of it all, the series poses an 
interesting question in the 
unprecedented 
election 
of 

a, well, young Pope: How 
might the new Pope’s more 
conservative ideals fit into the 
Catholic church moving in a 
more progressive direction? 
It’s an interesting idea that 
(though unheard of) deserves 
consideration. However, it is 
also quite an uncomfortable 
hypothetical 
to 
ponder. 

Fictional Pope Pius XIII — also 
known as Lenny Belardo, The 
Holy Father or His Eminence 
— is an unconventional Pope, 
one who claims heresy against 
a carbonated beverage and 
demands the papal crown’s 
deliverance from Washington 
D.C. for personal enjoyment. 
In one instance, he goes as 

far to question the existence 
of God in a conversation that 
can either be interpreted with 
a twisted sense of humor or 
as an actual confession, as he 
does claim not to buy into the 
tradition of Confession. After 
all, what should the Pope have 
to confess?

Although the corruption of 

power is palpable at times, it is 
the instances in which Lenny 
silently abuses his power — 
picking at the inner workings 
of the Vatican as a skilled 
musician 
might 

pluck the strings 
of their instrument 
— that are most 
captivating. 
Cleverly 
wicked, 

Law’s performance 
of the new Pope 
is at its best when 
he quietly asserts 
dominance over the 
Church, reminding 
his followers of his 
divine powers. If 
nothing else, it is a 
depiction of how a 
narcissist’s rise to power in one 
of the most powerful places on 
Earth could affect everything 
we know.

Though “The Young Pope” 

can feel outrageous at times, 
it’s important to remember 
that the series is quite aware 
of the boundaries its creators 
are 
pushing 
with 
religion 

and 
social 
controversies. 

When posed with a question 
regarding God’s house, Lenny 
muses: “Half of a duplex … 
with 
a 
private 
swimming 

pool.” With multiple fourth-
wall transgressions, the series 
is hyper-cognizant of its own 

mordant sense of humor. From 
pop music cues to talks of 
increasing cell phone coverage 
within the Vatican, this new 
Pope listens to no voice other 
than his own.

However, there are times 

in 
which 
one 
is 
unsure 

whether to laugh with mirth 
or nervousness. “Jokes are 
rarely telling,” Lenny proffers, 
a saying that is ironically in 
contradiction to the premise of 
the series. The series ponders 
the more serious questions of 

power abuse in 
a darker drama. 
Though 
sassy 

at 
times, 
it’s 

important 
to 

remember 
the 

parallels 
the 

“The 
Young 

Pope” 
draws 

to 
the 
social 

commentary of 
today.

With a flick 

of 
a 
cigarette 

and the spilling 
ash striking the 

Vatican’s marble floors, Law 
breathes, “There’s a new Pope 
now.” One cannot help but 
enthusiastically 
agree 
with 

that statement, as he gracefully 
glides over the Vatican as if 
it were a stage, a smug smile 
plastered to his face. “The 
Young Pope” questions religion 
and takes on challenging and 
outlandish subject matter, the 
cinematographically 
pleasing 

shots, partnered with Jude 
Law’s 
stellar 
performance 

and the striking similarities 
between today’s culture, make 
watching “The Young Pope” a 
dark pleasure. 

DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Film Editor

‘The Young Pope’ is as 
captivating as it is absurd

Pittsburgh’s Code Orange does 

not care about rules. They don’t 
care about genre definitions, 
expectations or limits of any kind. 
The band has been redefining 
hardcore music from the ground 
up since their inception, and on 
their third album, Forever, they 
show no signs of stopping.

Forever is as beautifully brutal 

as the band has ever been, while 
throwing in signature twists and 
turns that have catapulted them to 
their current spotlight. Drummer 
and vocalist Jami Morgan said 
the band’s latest album is different 
and highlighted their upcoming 
promotional tour that hits Detroit 
on January 17, 2017 at El Club.

“There’s 
all 
these 
textual 

layers and soundscapes, and 
there’s super hard-hitting stuff 
and there’s stuff that’s super 
dynamic,” Morgan said. “I felt 
like all these different forms of art 
on the album cover represented 
all those worlds coming together; 
kind of saying there are no rules.” 

The album is boundless, at 

once tapping into what can be 
expected of Code Orange while 
reaching farther than the band 
has gone before. With grunge-
pop curveballs like “Bleeding 
in the Blur” and the snarling 
shoegaze on “Ugly,” Forever 
is an engulfing album and a 
captivating listen from the start.

The tour lineup is as dynamic 

as the album.

“There’s different bands on the 

whole tour, and it’s super diverse 
and that’s how I wanted it to be,” 
Morgan said.

The Detroit date will feature 

Youth Code, an electronic duo 
reminiscent of Crystal Castles 
with harsher vocals, in direct 
support. 
Additional 
support 

comes from Lifeless, a heavy-
hitting 
hardcore 
group 
that 

utilizes lightning fast rhythms.

Code 
Orange’s 
live 

performances are evolving just as 
much as the band’s songwriting. 

“For this tour our guitarist kind 

of made a whole album’s worth of 
music, original music, that is like 
weird samples. It’s really well 
put together,” Morgan said. “It’s 
like a mixture of everything from 
soundtracking music, to weird 
industrial music, to just noise 
music, and it’s playing between all 
the bands at the show.”

The 
band 
is 
reinventing 

what can be expected of their 
performances, while amplifying 
their uniquely brooding aesthetic. 
Code Orange is unapologetically 
taking power over their own 
expression, keeping their sound 
and performance fresh while 
sticking with their thematic 
status quo.

“I think the last record (I Am 

King) we did was very much about 
kind of coming into your own, and 
being better than who you think 
you are,” Morgan said. “I think 
this record very much well deals 
with that, dealing with backlash 
from other people to what you’re 
doing, and at the same time, kind 
of just learning how to deal with 

pain and internal struggle on top 
of that.”

Jumping off I Am King, Code 

Orange 
deliberately 
moved 

between different aspects of 
metal — creating a new way of 
performing. 

“We’re kind of setting off and 

doing our own little DIY version 
— our version of performance 
art… making art and blending it 
with this straightforward, punch 
in the jaw, painful, hardcore metal 
music, kind of blurring those lines 
a little bit more, in our own way.”

Code Orange keeps their music 

relevant by putting tremendous 
effort into keeping their followers 
on their toes.

“I’m 
literally 
constantly 

thinking about this stuff 24/7 
and it’s almost like until we finish 
a record, it’s like an unfinished 
puzzle and all the pieces are 
mixed up,” Morgan said. “We 
knew 
what 
we 
wanted 
to 

accomplish, but at the same time 
it’s hard to get there sometimes. 
It’s very rewarding.”

As stated in an interview 

with Rolling Stone, it’s a painful 
process putting these pieces 
together, but Forever proves to be 
a rewarding result.

The show in Detroit will be an 

opportunity to see Code Orange 
unleash one of their most diverse 
sets to date at the stunningly 
intimate El Club, and it’s the 
perfect place for metal fans and 
newcomers alike to experience 
one of the most prominent bands 
bringing daring change to metal’s 
sphere of music.

6A — Tuesday, January 17, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In 2009, The xx emerged into 

the world with the minimalist 
dream that was their self-titled 
debut; xx was an album stripped 
down to its bare bones, the 
startling intensity of Oliver Sim’s 
and Romy Madley Croft’s voices 
cracking every song open to its 
core.

This 
bleached 

vulnerability 
helped 
contribute 

to 
the 
album’s 

attention-grabbing 
novelty 
but 
also 

reduced it to a bleak 
puzzle 
of 
black 

and white pieces. 
xx seemed to exist 
infinitely in hushed, 
empty 
spaces 
— 

void of vitality and shrouded in 
shadows.

In contrast, The xx’s newest 

release, I See You, bursts with 
color.

I See You takes the basic ideas 

introduced in xx and builds off of 
them, initiating complexity and 
depth; this album still holds on 
to The xx’s original, uncluttered 
sound, but adds more to its 
straightforward simplicity, mainly 
through lively and unpredictable 
background melodies. It is these 
melodies which illustrate the 
influence of In Colour, band 
member Jamie xx’s debut solo 
album. The release of In Colour in 
2015 seemed to bolster Jamie xx’s 
confidence in the creation of I See 

You, allowing for the formation 
of songs that stray from The xx’s 
standard sound.

Instead of songs composed of 

only Sim’s and Croft’s voices with 
few other distractions, I See You 
pushes the background music 
into the spotlight. In “Lips,” the 
driving force behind the song 
comes not through the vocals but 
rather through the accompanying 
rhythms; 
the 
gradual 
build 

of clapping beats and subtle 

instrumentals 
perfectly matches 
the 
celestial 

repetition of “Just 
your love / Just 
your 
shadow” 

and 
grows 
like 

ivy up the side of 
Croft’s airy vocals, 
culminating 
in a song that 
sparks with raw 
sensuality.

Alongside 
the 
background 

music, Sim’s and Croft’s voices 
have also evolved. Turning every 
song into a conversation, they 
build off each other organically, 
intertwining 
into 
beautiful 

harmonies 
then 
unraveling 

only to come back together 
again 
moments 
later. 
They 

approach every note with an 
easy familiarity. In “Dangerous,” 
Sim introduces us to pointedly 
buoyant 
background 
rhythms 

with “They say we’re in danger 
/ But I disagree.” A few seconds 
later, Croft adds her voice to his, 
a light layer that rounds out the 
sharper edges of Sim’s sound. 
There is a dynamism that exists 
in “Dangerous,” introduced by 

the symphonic back-and-forth 
between Sim’s vocals and Croft’s 
vocals, allowing the song to evenly 
shift from one note to the next.

The same concept can be seen 

in “I Dare You.” Even though 
this song is mellower than 
“Dangerous,” 
Sim 
and 
Croft 

work together in the same way: 
Effortlessly melding their voices 
together for the chorus, then just 
as effortlessly breaking them 
apart. This complete control and 
maturity Sim and Croft have 
over their respective vocals allow 
“I Dare You,” as well as every 
other song on the album, to feel 
perfectly balanced despite their 
ever-changing elements.

None of the songs on I See You 

are static. Instead, like waves, the 
songs are constantly ascending 
and receding, moving and shifting 
off of one another; the varying 
components of differing vocals 
and commanding background 
melodies combining to form 
songs that are sprawling in their 
animation.

This album is more than just 

a definite collection of songs; the 
beauty of I See You comes in its 
growth. Both in The xx’s growth 
as a band from their first album 
to this one and also the growth 
that can be seen within I See You 
itself, in the way every note builds 
off its predecessor. This album’s 
strength doesn’t come from its 
individual songs, but rather the 
way the songs are woven together 
to produce a complete entity, at 
times achingly simple and at other 
times vastly complex, but always 
constant in the way every moment 
is charged with energy.

The Women’s March 

The 
Women’s 
March 
on 

Washington next Saturday began 
as a few different Facebook events 
which eventually merged once 
people around the country started 
to realize that they weren’t the 
only ones having the same idea. 
Now, there are organized buses 
and confirmed permits and around 
200,000 people could be attending.

Even though I can’t go, it’s hard 

not to feel overwhelmed even just 
sitting at my desk, scrolling past 
story after story about the people 
and 
organizations 

playing large roles in 
the development of 
what will be one of 
the biggest protests 
in the nation’s history. 
And while I do at 
times get emotional 
thinking 
about 
it 

(especially when I’m 
listening to Hamilton, 
but I digress) I have 
noticed a trend in the 
coverage of the march 
that is concerning me.

The role that the 

media played in this 
election was larger by far than in 
any other election in recent history, 
which is interesting enough in 
itself, but it’s also a reason to pay 
incredibly close attention to the 
coverage of what has happened 
since November 8th and what will 
happen after the inauguration. And 
I’ve seen a split in the coverage of 
the women’s march. Half of what 
I read is about how the people 
and groups organizing the march 
are putting their intersectional 
approach to the march’s aims front 
and center, pushing to make this 
march as inclusive as possible. The 
other half of what I see details how 
there are tensions as some people — 
particularly White men and women 
— at times feel almost disinvited to 
the march, some even deciding not 
to go.

Some are saying that now is not 

the time to focus on our differences 
but on our similarities, on what we 
all hope to accomplish together. 
I disagree. Now is not the time 

to gloss over how progressive 
movements 
for 
change 
have 

historically been non-inclusive of 
people of different races, genders, 
religions, sexual orientations or 
socio-economic status. 

Feminism has historically been 

a 
White 
woman’s 
movement. 

Everyone has heard some variation 
of this statement before, and while 
it’s true in some ways, it’s also 
simplistic. The movement itself may 
have catered to more privileged 
groups in the past, but so did the 

press. The coverage of 
a social movement is 
essential in how people 
view 
its 
progress, 

especially those that are 
watching, for whatever 
reasons, curiously from 
the sidelines.

I’m not saying that the 

coverage of the Women’s 
March on Washington 
— the title of which 
echoes the March on 
Washington in 1963 — 
should be only focusing 
on the amazing fact that 
this march is happening 

and not on the fact that, like any 
movement, it’s going to have its 
imperfections. But a piece of pop 
art I saw on the Internet — a meme, 
if you will — a few days ago made 
me realize why the coverage of the 
tensions among those who want to 
participate in the march bothered 
me. It was a cartoon picture of two 
women, one grasping the other by 
the shoulders; her text bubble read 
“I just want to hear those three 
little words…” The text bubble 
from the other woman answered: 
“Agitate 
Educate 
Organize.” 

That phrase comes from another 
progressive movement (though my 
Internet searches revealed different 
interpretations of the origins), but it 
made me realize what my problem 
with the press in the terms of the 
Women’s March on Washington is.

The women of the Women’s 

March 
on 
Washington 
are 

agitating and organizing. They’re 
also 
educating 
and 
have 
an 

immense power to spread the 

ideas behind the abstract concept 
of intersectionality far and wide. 
And while there’s coverage of the 
agitation and organization — and 
the strengths and weaknesses in 
those two areas — there is little 
discussion of the educational power 
that this march has, across divides 
of age, regionality and partisanship, 
to name a few.

The 
Women’s 
March 
on 

Washington holds much more 
significance 
than 
solely 
anti-

Trump 
sentiment, 
and 
that’s 

something we have to focus on. 
This 
demonstration, 
and 
the 

coverage of it, has the power to 
catapult messages that people have 
been voicing for years: Experiences 
of race and gender are inextricable 
from each other, the urgency of the 
relationship between affordable 
health care and immigrant rights, 
the fact that environmental issues 
often 
disproportionately 
affect 

women and children — that 
“Women’s 
Rights 
are 
Human 

Rights,” to quote Hillary Clinton. 
That, more than anything else, is 
what sends shivers down my spine 
when I think of 200,000 people 
marching on January 21st.

Incidentally, this march is not 

about Clinton losing to President-
elect Donald Trump. But despite 
the fact that Hillary Clinton was 
not the candidate many — if not 
most — Democrats were hoping 
for, it was still a disappointment 
on a very fundamental level that 
November 8th, 2016, couldn’t 
be marked and celebrated as 
a 
monumental 
milestone 
for 

women’s equality. Little girls 
who play with President Barbie 
will still have to draw on their 
imagination 
to 
name 
her, 

because they won’t have a real-
life example to use. As silly and 
gendered as that sounds, it’s still 
disappointing. But as women 
are marching, girls are watching. 
And thinking about how kids 
now will grow up learning about 
how this march was self-aware 
of its inclusivity, and pushing to 
overcome the lack thereof, gives 
me hope.

ALBUM REVIEW

The passion of ‘Silence’ 

FILM REVIEW

Few movies bleed passion. 

With many disinterested movies 
funded with the hopes of a sizable 
return on investment, it’s always 
so refreshing to watch one where 
it’s clear that everyone was fully 
committed and believed in the 
project. “Silence” is a rare feat, 
a movie whose passion is visible 
from start to finish.

Director 
Martin 
Scorsese 

(“The Wolf of Wall Street”) 
retells Sh saku Endō’s novel of the 
same name following 25 years of 
production, a “passion project.” 
After 
several 
disputes 
with 

production companies, including 
struggles to sign actors like Daniel 
Day-Lewis (“Lincoln”), Scorsese 
finally delivers one of the most 
challenging and rewarding movies 
of his 21st century catalogue.

“Silence” tells the story of 

Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues 
(Andrew 
Garfield, 
“Hacksaw 

Ridge”) and Francisco Garupe 
(Adam Driver, “Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens”) in their quest to 
Japan to search for their mentor, 
Cristóvão Ferreira, who is said 
to 
have 
committed 
apostasy. 

Upon arriving in Japan, the 
priests and their new Catholic 
followers face opposition from the 
Samurai. Rodrigues is eventually 
imprisoned, along with many of 
his Catholic disciples.

Ideas of faith and sacrifice are 

the focal point of “Silence,” and 
answers do not come easily for 

Rodrigues. In all regards, the 
Catholics’s loyalty to their religion 
is tested under the most brutal of 
conditions. “Silence” reasons to 
make meaning of religious sacrifice 
when meaning is indiscernible. 
It’s a testament to those lost and 
finding their way through religion 
against all opposing forces.

For those expecting crusade-

like battle scenes and Samurai 
fights, 
anticipate 

disappointment. 
“Silence” is a slow-
burner, 
a 
movie 

that pays off with 
great 
royalties 

to 
those 
patient 

enough to endure 
its 
considerable 

length. 
Those 

rewards, 
ultimately, fuel the 
movie for its entire 
duration. Although lagging at 
some points, the movie is just 
short of feeling bloated. The 
same story couldn’t be told in 90 
minutes.

From breathtaking shots of 

lush Taiwan — where the movie 
was shot — to Japanese towns, 
“Silence” is visually stunning. 
Still, it’s not overly dependent on 
the gorgeous scenery and sets. 
The film plays off the wonders 
of the region while not getting 
distracted by their beauty. It 
adds to the movie, but never gets 
carried away by the rocky shores 
or expansive hills.

Cinematographer 
Rodrigo 

Prieto’s 
(“Passengers”) 
shots 

are haunting. Without being 
intensely gory or too brutal, 

certain images of “Silence” are 
tragic and encapsulating; each 
shot feels like a thousand lines of 
dialogue.

The film does not rely on 

melodrama to communicate its 
meaning. Garfield’s performance 
locks in key emotions without 
ever breaking the limit of what 
feels overdone. It’s unusual in 
that every expression and line 

shows the most 
extreme 
forms 

of conflict and 
human suffering. 
However, 
it 

is 
Driver’s 

performance 
that 
should 

surely 
solidify 

him as one of his 
generation’s best 
actors. After roles 
varying 
from 

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” 
to “Paterson,” Driver once again 
proves his versatility. Unlike 
“Girls,” the underwhelming TV 
show that propelled Driver into 
stardom, he’s only getting better 
with each release.

“The Wolf of Wall Street” was 

the first introduction for many 
teenagers and college students 
to Martin Scorsese; the movie is 
his highest grossing of all time. 
“Silence” is about as different as 
possible. Whereas “The Wolf of 
Wall Street” was about hedonism 
and wealth, “Silence” is ascetic 
and impoverished. It rejects the 
maximalism of “Wolf” in favor 
of minimalism. The two can’t be 
compared. Though, if necessary, 
“Silence” wins.

Before 
tip-off 
Saturday 

afternoon, before senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. carried his 
team down the stretch and 
before Michigan earned the 
win it so desperately needed, 
the Wolverines had a team 
meeting in Walton’s hotel room.

No 
coaches 
were 
there. 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
only knew about it because he 
tried to call a meeting himself 
after Friday’s practice, sensing 
that the Wolverines didn’t have 
the necessary “bounce” they 
would need against Nebraska.

Walton, in his own right, 

wanted his team to know 
that the time to play up to 

their maximum potential was 
running out.

“There’s only so many games 

left,” 
Walton 
said. 
“We’re 

hitting the (middle) stretch, and 
the back stretch is coming soon. 
It’s time to make some noise.”

Behind Walton’s efforts on 

the court, the Wolverines may 
have taken the first step toward 
doing so, as they defeated 
the Cornhuskers in a 91-85 
barnburner.

Walton started the game 

quietly, playing just 10 minutes 
of the first half due to foul 
trouble. But when Michigan 
(2-3 Big Ten, 12-6 overall) 
needed its captain most, Walton 
obliged.

With just over five minutes 

remaining 
in 
the 
game, 

Nebraska was threatening. The 

Cornhuskers (3-2, 9-8) were 
getting anything they wanted 
on the offensive end, and it was 
starting to look more and more 
like déjà vu.

But with the Wolverines’ lead 

down to one, Walton received 
an outlet pass from Wagner and 
pushed it down the floor before 
nailing a transition 3-pointer. 
Two possessions later, with the 
lead down to one once more, he 
did it again.

Then Walton turned around 

on the defensive end, picked 
Glynn Watson Jr.’s pocket, and 
took it to the basket before 
drawing a foul and knocking 
down two free throws to give 
Michigan a seven-point lead 
that it wouldn’t relinquish in 
the final 4:05. He finished with 
20 points — 16 of which came 

in the second half — while 

shooting 
a 
perfect 

3-for-3 
from 

behind the 

arc 

and an impressive 5-for-6 from 
the floor.

The Wolverines had some 

help before the game even 
started. 
On 
Wednesday, 
it 

was announced that Nebraska 
forward Ed Morrow suffered a 
right foot injury and would be 
ruled out indefinitely.

Morrow’s 
absence 
meant 

that 
Nebraska 
would 
be 

without its leading rebounder 
and third-leading scorer. And 
with forward Isaiah Roby in 
his place, the Wolverines were 
clearly looking to attack the 
basket — giving the ball to 
Moritz Wagner early and often.

The 
sophomore 
forward 

scored from everywhere on the 
floor, shooting 2-for-4 from 
deep and going a perfect 7-for-
7 from the charity stripe to end 
the half with a team-high 14 
points.

Michigan’s offense as a whole 

thrived as usual for the majority 
of the half. The Wolverines shot 
50 percent from the floor and 
their willingness to look down 

low seemed to be the 

perfect recipe for 

success.

But 

with 6:36 remaining in the half, 
the Cornhuskers switched to 
a 1-3-1 zone. Michigan scored 
on six straight possessions, 
but the new defensive scheme 
cooled the Wolverines down. 
After Nebraska implemented 
the zone, Michigan missed 
three 3-pointers and redshirt 
junior 
forward 
Duncan 

Robinson turned the ball over. 
Its struggles on the offensive 
end allowed the Cornhuskers 
to trim their deficit to as little 
as one.

The Wolverines’ defensive 

effort didn’t help them either. 
Though their 16 points off eight 
turnovers were an encouraging 
sign, 
they 
still 
allowed 

Nebraska to shoot 61.5 percent 
from the floor and get to the 
rim with ease. By the end of the 
contest, they had still allowed 
the Cornhuskers to shoot 56.2 
percent overall.

And while Michigan had 

contained senior guard Tai 
Webster to begin the frame, he 
eventually showcased why he is 
fourth in the Big Ten in scoring. 
Webster finished the first half 
with a game-high 17 points 
— just 0.7 shy of his season 
average — on 7-for-8 shooting. 
As it turned out, Webster was 

just getting started, as he 

ended up with a game-

high 28 points.

“You can 

see 

what 
development 
does,” 

Beilein 
said. 
“Webster, 
his 

freshman 
and 
sophomore 

years, he was not a factor on 
that team. A little bit more of a 
factor last year. But now, all of a 
sudden he’s going to get buckets 
on anybody.”

Despite 
Webster’s 
first-

half dominance, though, the 
Wolverines managed to enter 
halftime leading, 40-36.

Michigan 
would 
never 

relinquish that lead.

The Wolverines rode their 

trio of Wagner, Walton and 
senior 
wing 
Zak 
Irvin 
to 

overcome 
their 
defensive 

struggles and poor rebounding 
effort. Wagner scored nine 
second-half points to finish 
with a team-high 23, while 
Irvin complimented his game 
perfectly, scoring 18 points.

“Here at Michigan, man, if 

we have to beat someone 99-98, 
we cool with it,” Walton said. 
“It’s all about winning. We’ll 
make the adjustments when 
we need to and go back to 
the drawing board and make 
adjustments, but when we come 
out of a game with a win, why 
be so critical?”

Following Walton’s scoring 

outburst, Michigan managed 
to keep the Cornhuskers at bay 
— making six stops in the final 
three minutes to hold on for the 
victory.

But before the Wolverines 

did any of that, they simply met 
in a hotel room.

Michigan loses weekend series in Minnesota

MINNEAPOLIS — After a 

turnover by Minnesota, junior 
forward Brendan Warren charged 
from center ice toward the 
ninth-ranked Gophers’ goal on a 
breakaway. 
But at the 
same time 
as Warren’s 
shot was blocked by Minnesota 
goaltender 
Eric 
Schierhorn, 

Gopher forward Tommy Novak 
hooked Warren, giving him a 
penalty shot.

With a chance to bring the 

Michigan hockey team within 
one 
with 
seven 
minutes 
to 

play, Warren needed to score 
to keep his team in the game. 
Unfortunately for the Wolverines, 
his shot went wide left.

Though Michigan may not have 

realized it at the time, Warren’s 
miss may have cost it a win. About 
a minute later, senior forward 
Evan Allen knocked in a goal from 
a long shot by senior defenseman 
Nolan de Jong to cut the lead to 

3-2. The Golden Gophers (5-1-
0 Big Ten, 13-5-2 overall) held 
strong, though, escaping with 
a 4-2 victory Saturday night at 
Mariucci Arena.

“I think our third period was 

much better today than it was 
yesterday,” De Jong said. “Both 
games came down to whether 
it was a PK or small little plays 
where we didn’t block a shot or 
box out enough. We showed good 
glimpses in both games, I think 
we definitely showed more today 
than we did yesterday, but I think 
it was just our willingness to 
stick to it through the whole 60 
minutes tonight is what gave us 
the opportunity in the last couple 
minutes to maybe tie it up.”

For the first two periods, the 

Wolverines (1-5-0, 8-11-1) simply 
couldn’t find the net. It wasn’t 
until the third that Michigan 
finally managed to put points 
on the scoreboard. Freshman 
forward Steven Merl ended the 
drought, shooting the puck past 
Schierhorn from the goaltender’s 
right side on a pass from Warren.

Minnesota spent the early 

minutes of the first period passing 
the puck around in Michigan’s 
zone. The teams looked relatively 
even, as the Wolverines took a few 
shots and the Golden Gophers 
answered right back.

Michigan 
looked 
to 
head 

into the first intermission in a 
scoreless tie. With 42.7 seconds 
left, De Jong — who received a 
game misconduct penalty Friday 
night — earned another trip to 
the box for tripping Kloos. The 
Wolverines had to play a man-
down for the remainder of the 
period, and for about 40 seconds, 
Michigan looked as though it 
would kill the penalty.

Minnesota 
forward 
Vinni 

Lettieri had other ideas. He took 
a pass from fellow forward Leon 
Bristedt from behind Michigan’s 
face-off circle and shot it right 
past freshman goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne. For the second straight 
night, the Wolverines allowed a 
goal with just seconds remaining 
in the first period.

“Those are tough goals to give 

up,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “I’ve said all along, 

first minute goals or last minute 
goals, and I think we gave up four 
of them this weekend, whether it 
was just coincidence or it was a 
breakdown or letdown, I couldn’t 
tell you. But those goals are 
backbreakers. I thought our team 
responded well.”

In the second frame, Michigan 

couldn’t hang onto the puck, as 
the Golden Gophers controlled it 
and tallied 11 shots. Meanwhile, 
the Wolverines didn’t take a shot 
for 12 minutes, and by the end of 
the period, they had notched just 
three.

Despite 
its 
difficulties 
on 

offense, Michigan hung with the 
Golden Gophers for the first 19 
minutes of the period. Lavigne 
continued his prowess behind the 
net, saving 10 shots in the second, 
including a shot near the blue line 
from Minnesota forward Tyler 
Sheehy and a one-timer from 
forward Connor Reilly on a power 
play.

Once again, though, the Golden 

Gophers found late heroics, this 
time coming from defenseman 
Ryan 
Collins. 
Collins 
found 

the net off a wrist shot near the 
blue line, taking away whatever 
momentum might have lingered 
for the Wolverines.

Early in the third period, 

Lettieri was held by senior 
forward Alex Kile on a breakaway, 
giving him a penalty shot. Unlike 
Warren, Lettieri converted the 
opportunity to give Minnesota 
a 3-2 lead. And with just 22.7 
seconds left in the game, he 
scored his third goal of the night 
to extend the lead to the final 
score of 4-2.

Still, Berenson was optimistic 

about Saturday’s result. Michigan 
remained in the game until the 
final minutes, something it could 
not say Friday night.

“They didn’t quit,” Berenson 

said. “We got a break on a couple 
shots and the puck started going 
in for us. Then we got back in the 
game and made a game of it. It’s 
too bad we couldn’t score the tying 
goal. They scored on a penalty 
shot, we missed on a penalty shot, 
it was simple. So anyway, it was 
not a good outcome, but it was, I 
thought, a better team effort right 
from the start.”

by simply 
beating the 
teams they 
were sup-
posed to beat 
— and with 
it, any benefit 
of the doubt 
they could 
have hoped to 
receive also 
disappeared.

After allowing more than 

75 points in four of its last five 
games, Michigan’s tourna-
ment hopes seem to rest on 
the chance that its offense can 
outgun opponents. The only 
problem is, the point in the con-
ference schedule at which that 
strategy was viable is essen-
tially over. And the Wolverines 
finished just 2-3 during that 
stretch.

Over the next month, Michi-

gan will be going up against 
some of the conference’s best 
teams with little time for a 
breather. The Wolverines 
will play two games apiece 
against Wisconsin, Indiana and 
Michigan State. A pair of theo-
retically winnable home games 
against Ohio State and Illinois 
will be added to the mix, but 
even then, it’s not a schedule 
that inspires confidence.

KenPom.com projects that 

Michigan will split those eight 
games to go an even 4-4. That 

would bring its conference 
record to 6-7, at which point 
KenPom projects the Wolver-
ines would lose four of their 
final five contests. They are 
currently slated to be KenPom’s 
higher-ranked team in just 
four remaining games on their 
conference schedule. It’s worth 
noting that, so far, the popular 
basketball analytics website 
has not been entirely accurate 
at predicting Michigan’s out-
comes.

But the current projections 

illustrate an important point as 
the Wolverines veer ever closer 
to panic territory: the sched-

ule’s not going to get any easier 
from here.

Michigan had its opportunity 

to load up on 
easier confer-
ence road wins 
against Iowa and 
Illinois, and it 
missed. Add in 
a blown home 
game against 
Maryland, and 
there actually 
has yet to be a 
game in confer-
ence play that 
the Wolverines could not have 
conceivably won. And only 

one — the 85-69 drubbing at 
the hands of Illinois — truly 
reached blowout territory.

But now 

Michigan finds 
itself in a precar-
ious position. At 
a time when the 
Wolverines need 
to be gearing up 
for a stretch of 
play that could 
either punch 
their NCAA tick-
et or virtually 
eliminate them 

from at-large contention, they 
are forced to split their focus by 

looking for answers.

No Michigan team in recent 

memory has seen defensive 
struggles this consistent in Big 
Ten play. Even two years ago, 
when the Wolverines limped to 
a .500 record, they gave up 80 
points just three times all sea-
son. They have already done so 
four times this year.

The offense, on the other 

hand, is actually performing 
quite well in both raw statistics 
and efficiency numbers. It has 
taken on a different character 
than other recent John Beilein 
teams in that it has two big men 
it can look to both down low 

and outside in redshirt sopho-
more DJ Wilson and sophomore 
Moritz Wagner. It’s hard to 
deny the group is still danger-
ously reliant on the deep ball, 
but with the current roster 
makeup and the head coach’s 
longstanding philosophy, that’s 
probably for the best — espe-
cially since shots have been 
falling.

In fact, according to KenPom, 

Michigan’s offense is by far the 
most efficient it has been since 
2014, when the Wolverines won 
the Big Ten. The problem is that 
the defense is the least efficient 
it has been in the KenPom era 
(since 2002).

That leaves Michigan with 

a decision to make. Either the 
Wolverines can embrace an 
identity as the most extreme 
version of the shootout style 
they have long leaned toward, 
or they can attempt a defensive 
180 in hopes of recapturing the 
potential they flashed at the 2K 
Classic in November.

It may not make a huge dif-

ference which identity they 
choose to pursue, but they will 
need to decide as fast as pos-
sible.

The next month will be 

bookended by games against 
Wisconsin, the class of the Big 
Ten. It would be neither stun-
ning nor singularly damaging 
for Michigan to lose Tuesday in 
Madison, in a road environment 
that is unforgiving to even the 
most polished opponents.

But after that, the Wolverines 

will have to figure themselves 
out in a hurry. There’s simply 
no time left to waste.

Wolverines falter 
against Nebraska

Coming off a decisive victory 

against Maryland on Friday, the 
Michigan wrestling team looked 
to pull off an upset against No. 6 
Nebraska in Lincoln on Sunday. 
But after being forced to forfeit 
the 125-pound match to start the 
meet, the 13th-ranked Wolverines 
could not overcome the early 
deficit, falling 29-15.

Michigan (1-3 Big Ten, 4-3 

overall) forfeited the opening 
match after redshirt freshman 
Austin Assad got banged up in 
practice during the week and was 
unable to make the trip to Lincoln.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Stevan 

Micic 
faced 
Nebraska’s 
Eric 

Montoya in the 133-pound bout. 
Micic got off to a hot start with an 
early takedown and never let up, 
recording four more takedowns 
in the match to capture the 
decision, 13-7. Micic’s win put the 
Wolverines on the board for the 
first time, narrowing the score to 
6-3.

“Everyone saw what Stevan’s 

capable of doing when he’s firing 
off his attacks,” said Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland.

In the 141-pound match — the 

third of the day— freshman Sal 
Profaci took on Nebraska’s Colton 
McCrystal. After a very low-
scoring, defensive start in which 
both wrestlers spent most of the 
time on their feet, McCrystal took 
over in the third period with a 
decisive takedown, winning the 
match, 8-4, and extending the 
Cornhuskers’ lead to 9-3.

Minutes 
later, 
redshirt 

sophomore Zach Hall avenged 
Profaci’s loss with a 14-5 major 
decision 
win 
against 
Collin 

Purinton in the 149-pound match. 
Hall started fast with a pair of 
takedowns in the first period 
and a near fall in the second, and 
continued to be aggressive until 
the end to cut Nebraska’s lead to 
9-7.

Next up was senior Brian 

Murphy, 
who 
battled 
Tyler 

Berger in the 157-pound match. 
Murphy looked to rebound after 
starting the season with five 
straight losses, but Berger proved 
to be too much for the Michigan 
veteran. Murphy was pinned 
with 1:35 left in the third period 
after a long sprawl on the mat. 
Berger’s pin gave the Cornhuskers 
six points and a 15-7 lead over the 
Wolverines.

In 
the 
165-pound 
match, 

redshirt freshman Logan Massa 
— ranked second in the country 
— defeated Justin Arthur in a 
dominant fashion to record a 
17-4 technical fall. Massa was 
in complete control, notching 
takedown after takedown until 
the match was over in the second 
period. With his victory, Massa 
maintained his perfect record for 
the season.

After Massa’s win, redshirt 

freshman Myles Amine notched 
a takedown in the sudden death 
period of the 174-pound match 
to tie the dual at 15 going into the 
final three matches.

But 
the 
scoring 
stopped 

there for Michigan. Redshirt 
junior Ernest Battaglia, redshirt 
freshman Jackson Striggow, and 
freshman Dan Perry all lost their 
matches.

Though the team did not come 

away with a win, McFarland 
was impressed with the level of 
effort his group gave and saw it 
as a learning opportunity for his 
young team.

“I thought, as a whole, our 

guys wrestled really hard today,” 
McFarland said. “We talk a lot 
about how your effort has to 
be there every time, for seven 
complete minutes, and I thought 
a lot of our guys did a good job of 
that.

“It was a great experience 

for us to come out there and 
compete against a team like that,” 
McFarland said. “For our growth 
down the road, I thought it was 
invaluable. … We’ve got to learn 
from this, grow from this, and use 
this experience to develop and get 
better.”

WRESTLING


MINNEAPOLIS 
— 
The 

zamboni swept around the rink 
Friday morning, slowly clearing 
any shreds of ice that had been 
loosened by the skates of a 
hockey team minutes before. The 
machine’s unmistakable droning 
filled the arena, bouncing off the 
maroon and gold colored seats 
and rising to the rafters where 
countless banners hung from the 
ceiling, detailing the program’s 
history.

After a while, the zamboni 

disappeared, entering the bowels 
of the stadium, and it was quiet in 
Mariucci Arena.

Everything in Mariucci, it 

seems, is bigger. Mariucci is a 
modern-day coliseum without the 
gladiator games. This is the type 
of facility where children, playing 
pond hockey in the biting cold 
while holding onto their dreams 
as tightly as they grip their sticks, 
aspire to play one day.

The rink is Olympic-sized, 

which means it’s wider than 
the majority of college arenas. 
Opposing 
teams 
have 
been 

overcome by the speed and pace of 
the game on this ice in particular. 
Those same banners in the rafters 
are evidence of that. The arena 
practically comes with a script 
to be followed: the opposing 
team tires out from having to 
cover more ice or fails to cover its 
defensive zone assignments, the 
home team pounces, and the fans 
go home happy.

And the fans — they show up in 

droves. Mariucci, opened in 1993, 
is cavernous. The seats start at 
rink level and flow approximately 
two to three stories upward. The 
arena is one of the largest in the 
nation, seating 10,000 people 
— almost 3,500 more than the 
venerable Yost Ice Arena can hold.

For a beleaguered Michigan 

hockey team, this is where it 
found itself over the course of one 
January weekend as it sought to 
rekindle the embers of a dying 
season.

The Wolverines began the 

weekend — and the second 
half of their season — with an 
unremarkable 8-9-1 record, sitting 
at No. 34 in the PairWise Rankings. 
It was a hole that they had dug 
themselves into, slowly but surely, 
over the course of several months. 
Their fading hopes of returning 
to the NCAA Tournament this 
spring lay with the pair of games 
against the Golden Gophers, who 
were tied atop the conference 
standings with Penn State — a 
team that had already dismantled 
the Wolverines earlier this season. 

The dimensions of the rink, 

the size of the crowd and the skill 
level of the home team are all 
reasons why Mariucci is a difficult 
place for any team to exorcise its 
demons. It just happens that this is 
especially true for Michigan.

The Wolverines entered the 

series having won only once over 
their past six games at Mariucci. 
A 6-2 win last year — thanks to an 
explosive offense long gone to the 
NHL — broke a winless streak that 
had dated back to 2008.

Nine years ago, the roles were 

reversed. The Golden Gophers 
were just beginning a three-year 
stretch of missing the postseason, 
while Michigan was still in the 
midst of its record-setting 22-year 
NCAA Tournament streak. But 
Minnesota corrected its course — 
it has made the tournament in four 
of the past five seasons and has 
won the Big Ten every year since 
its formation. The Wolverines, on 
the other hand, have faltered.

The NCAA Tournament streak 

ended in 2013, and what was once 
the expectation every year has 
now become an uphill climb, as 
Michigan has made it only once in 
the past four years.

A win or two against No. 9 

Minnesota would have provided 
the Wolverines with some much-
needed 
momentum 
as 
they 

entered the final stretch. Both the 
players and coaches recognized 
this. After all, opportunities to hit 
a partial reset on your season don’t 
come around very often.

“I’m hoping that we take some 

steps toward that,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson two days 
before the opener. “I think our 
team is right there, but there’s 
got to be a galvanizing moment 
or event or game or something 
happens with our group.”

Winning the games so that 

Berenson’s hope would come to 

fruition — that was the challenge 
they faced Friday and Saturday. 
But this wouldn’t have been the 
first Michigan team in recent 
memory to have turned things 
around with one series.

***
The streak began on the road 

against an old CCHA rival. Miami 
(Ohio) won two close games 
against the Wolverines, the first 
in regulation and the second by 
shootout. Then it spiraled out 
of control, as they suffered four 
straight losses at home over the 
course of nine days.

After six consecutive losses, 

the 2011-12 Michigan team — once 
ranked No. 1 in the nation — was 
staring at a .500 record near the 
midway point of the season.

A trip to Alaska awaited, and 

after that, uncertainty. Prior to the 
series against the Nanooks, seven 
of the nine teams remaining on 

the Wolverines’ regular-season 
schedule were ranked in the top-
20.

Michigan needed a win in the 

worst way before it entered the 
meat of its schedule. But that was 
easier said than done.

The 
Wolverines, 
according 

to 
former 
goaltender 
Shawn 

Hunwick, had tried everything 
to end the losing streak. They 
had 
changed 
their 
pre-game 

rituals, from not listening to music 
before the game to switching up 
their stretches. The coaching 
staff had tried mixing up the 
lines and making other strategic 
adjustments. 
Still, 
the 
team 

continued to lose and plummet in 
the rankings.

“At that point, you’re like, 

‘There’s nothing else to change.’ 
We were going to go out there 
and throw everything up against 
(Alaska) because we were the 
30th-ranked team in the country 
at that point in time,” Hunwick 
said. “What do we have to lose?”

The team traveled to Alaska 

early that week. It would have to 
find a way to win away from the 
friendly confines of Yost — though 
Hunwick believes leaving Ann 
Arbor actually helped.

“I do think there’s something 

about going on the road, getting 
away from the pressures of 
playing at home (and) the grind 
of going to school,” Hunwick said. 
“These guys are going to class on 
Fridays and stuff. When you get on 
the road, sometimes you just (say), 
‘We’re all going to come together 
here and we’re going to battle.’ ”

Hunwick’s theory was on its way 

to becoming true when Michigan 
scored a little over two minutes 
into the series opener. But then 
disaster struck — Alaska responded 
10 minutes later to tie the game, 
before scoring two more goals in 
the span of just seven seconds to 
take a commanding two-goal lead 
en route to a 4-3 win.

The losing streak had reached 

seven. Salvation would have to 
wait.

Meanwhile, 
the 
Wolverines 

regrouped. The team was led 
by a quartet of seniors that 
year: Hunwick, who was the 
assistant captain, forwards Luke 
Glendening and David Wohlberg 
and defenseman Greg Pateryn.

Younger players like Mike 

Chiasson, a freshman defenseman 
that season, looked up to those 
four 
during 
this 
particularly 

trying stretch.

“... Those guys had been through 

a lot in their time here,” Chiasson 
said. “We leaned on those guys a 
lot, and I don’t remember exactly 
who got the goals or who made 
the big plays at times, but it was 
probably a bunch of different guys 
who stepped up, whether it was 
a freshman or a big save by the 
goalie or one of the leaders on the 
team.”

Hunwick thought of himself as 

the least vocal leader out of the 
four seniors. But while he may 
not have been the loudest in the 
locker room, his play that year 
spoke for itself. Hunwick turned 
in a historic season, posting a 2.00 
goals-against-average with a .932 
save percentage to earn a spot as a 
Hobey Baker finalist.

And in the second game of 

the series, he turned in a gutsy 
performance 
when 
his 
team 

needed it most, tallying a 25-save 
shutout.

Unfortunately for Michigan, 

Alaska’s 
Scott 
Greenham 

happened to be just as good as 
Hunwick 
during 
regulation, 

saving all 41 shots he faced to force 
the game into overtime.

But less than a minute into the 

extra period, Michigan freshman 
forward Alex Guptill threw a 
bouncing puck to the net and 
Greenway could not make his 42nd 
save. The Wolverines had ended 
their losing streak, thanks to the 
efforts of their senior goaltender 
and Guptill’s dose of luck.

“... It was a fluky goal,” 

Hunwick 
said. 
“I 
remember 

getting a shutout thinking I could 
have given up five or six goals that 
game. I was fortunate to get out 
(of) that game without giving up 
a goal. I didn’t feel particularly 
comfortable, probably due to a 
seven-game losing streak and the 
pressure that goes with that. I 
think we were just fortunate to 
get out (with a win). It was just a 
battle.”

However fluky the win may 

have been, it was the cure 
Michigan needed. The Wolverines 
went on to win 16 of their next 21 
games, resuscitating what had 
once seemed like a lost season, 
before 
falling 
to 
Cornell 
in 

overtime of the NCAA Midwest 
Regional.

Chiasson and Hunwick have 

kept up with this year’s team 
and both felt it could pull off a 
turnaround similar to their own.

And 
both 
also 
felt 
that 

turnaround started with the series 
at Minnesota.

“... Minnesota’s going to be 

a tough task,” Hunwick said. 
“That’s a tough place to go just like 
Alaska was, but games like that, in 
situations like this, it can change 
your whole season.”

Added Chiasson: “... It could 

just take one weekend for them. 
It doesn’t have to be a sweep, it 
could just be a good weekend for 
them to get their game and their 
feet underneath them. That’s 
the special crazy thing about 
this sport — you look at what the 
Columbus Blue Jackets have done 
with their win streak.

“It 
happens 
quick, 
and 

sometimes all it takes is just a 
couple wins to get going and to 
find your legs and to find your 
game.”

***

For a short time, it seemed 

like the Wolverines had a chance 
in the series opener against the 
Golden Gophers to capture a win 
like that of their predecessors 
against Alaska.

The game started quickly, with 

Minnesota firing several shots at 
senior goaltender Zach Nagelvoort 
in the first few minutes.

But Nagelvoort and Michigan 

were up to the task early, stopping 
whatever the Golden Gophers 
threw at them, and nearly nine 
minutes into the first period, the 
Wolverines took the lead.

Senior forward Evan Allen 

found the puck along the boards 
and passed it to senior forward 
Max Shuart, whose one-timer 
beat Minnesota goaltender Eric 
Schierhorn.

It felt like the moment Michigan 

had been waiting for. Then things 
fell apart in the span of just six 

minutes. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

continued 
to 
surrender 

opportunity after opportunity, 
and Nagelvoort could only stop so 
many chances.

The first goal beat him short side 

to tie things up. The second was a 
perfectly-placed deflection that 
he didn’t have much of a chance 
on. And the third — the true 
backbreaker — came with just 1.7 
seconds left in the opening period, 
when Michael Szmatula struck 
home a rebound that seemed to 
visibly deflate the visitors.

A short-handed goal in the 

second period briefly cut the deficit 
to one, but Michigan still could not 
generate any consistent offense, 
while the defense struggled to stay 
with Minnesota’s explosive top 
line — especially forward Tyler 
Sheehy, who slammed home a juicy 
rebound before sniping one past 
Nagelvoort late for the final score.

All the problems the Wolverines 

dealt with throughout the year, 
from leaving the goaltender out 
to dry, suffering breakdowns 
on defense and taking too many 
penalties, were present in Friday’s 
performance.

“We’re giving up too many 

goals — it was just about the same 
old story,” Berenson said after 
Friday’s game. “Too many shots, 
too many chances against, and 
we weren’t good enough with the 
puck and we weren’t good enough 
without the puck. … We have to 
be better. Do I think we can play 
better? Yeah. That’s our job, and 
it’s our players’ job to figure this 
out and to get ourselves playing at 
a better level, with or without the 
puck.”

Whatever 
post-game 
talk 

Berenson gave his team appeared 
to work the following night — at 
least for the first period.

Michigan 
was 
aggressive 

on both ends of the ice, forcing 
turnovers and creating chances 
of its own. The Wolverines’ 
newfound intensity and effort 
were making the Golden Gophers 
look sluggish — until another last-

minute calamity befell Michigan.

With 
just 
seconds 
left, 

Minnesota’s Vinni Lettieri carried 
the puck down the ice before 
unleashing a shot at a partially 
screened 
Hayden 
Lavigne. 

Obstructed 
or 
not, 
Lavigne 

couldn’t find the puck, and the 
Golden Gophers took the lead with 
just 2.3 seconds left in a period in 
which they had been outplayed.

The Wolverines seemed dazed 

as they skated to the locker room, 
and it showed when they came 
back out for the next period.

It took Michigan nearly 12 

minutes just to register a shot on 
goal. The Golden Gophers scored 
again in the waning seconds, 
entering the third period with a 
two-goal lead.

Then things turned from bad to 

worse.

A late cross-checking penalty 

gave the Wolverines a power play 
heading into the final period, 
but just 30 seconds in, Michigan 
coughed up the puck.

Senior forward Alex Kile was 

forced to pull down Minnesota’s 
Lettieri 
on 
the 
short-handed 

breakaway, and Lettieri calmly 
converted the ensuing penalty 

shot.

The Wolverines added two 

goals later in the period, but the 
damage had already been done.

“Those are tough goals to give 

up,” Berenson said. “I’ve said all 
along, first-minute goals or last-
minute goals (are tough to give 
up), and I think we gave up four 
of them this weekend. Whether 
it was just coincidence or it was a 
breakdown or letdown, I couldn’t 
tell you. But those goals are 
backbreakers.

“... We finally got back in the 

game late, but too little, too 
late. They had a penalty shot 
opportunity — we had a power 
play and sure enough, they get 
a breakaway against it, and the 
game turns that quickly.”

***
Michigan arrived in Minnesota 

looking for redemption and found 
none. An already low PairWise 
Ranking — often just the top-16 
make the NCAA Tournament — 
dropped three more spots to No. 37.

Glimpses of the team that had 

beaten No. 5 Boston University 
and No. 11 Union had appeared 
at times against the Golden 
Gophers. But glimpses aren’t 
enough, especially with just 14 
games left in the regular season. 
For every few minutes Michigan 
played Minnesota tough, there 
were still long stretches of play 
when the Golden Gophers had 
their way with the Wolverines. 
Michigan, it would appear, still 
lacks the consistency of an NCAA 
Tournament team.

Berenson and senior captain 

Nolan 
De 
Jong 
remained 

optimistic 
about 
the 
team’s 

trajectory after the sweep. The 
Wolverines’ effort the second 
night, in comparison to the 
opener, was something they hoped 
to build on.

“We talked (last night) about 

a commitment to playing team 
defense 
and 
playing 
harder 

without the puck and not giving 
them so much time and space in 
our zone,” Berenson said Saturday. 
“And I thought we did that. I 
thought we played better most of 
the game. Let’s face it, we only had 
one shot most of the way through 
the second period. We killed two 
penalties but they had us on our 
heels. But I thought we started the 
game stronger and we competed 
harder all night.”

Added De Jong: “Obviously 

we didn’t get the win, but I liked 
the way our team came out in the 
third and at least showed some 
grit, showed some character. That 
pushback is something that we 
haven’t had enough this year.”

When asked how he thought 

the 
team 
could 
improve 
its 

consistency, De Jong spoke about 
the work Michigan would have 
to put in this week at practice to 
limit the type of letdowns they 
suffered against Minnesota. He 
spoke about the need for the 
Wolverines to believe that they 
could play with full intensity for 
all 60 minutes. He mentioned that 
a sweep of Michigan State would 
be “huge” for the Wolverines.

And yet whether he wants to 

admit it or not, De Jong and his 
team already had a chance to 
reignite their season.

But like so many in recent years, 

they fell prey to Mariucci.

Michigan finds new physicality,
claims victory against Nebraska 

After an 85-69 blowout loss 

to Illinois, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team left Champaign 
battered, bruised and with what 
now appears to have been a wake-
up call. The Wolverines were 
bullied inside the paint by the 
Fighting Illini’s duo of forwards, 
Maverick Morgan and Kipper 
Nichols — who scored 16 and 13 
points, respectively.

Fueled by a dig from Morgan 

calling them a “white-collar team” 
and by a team meeting called by 
senior guard Derrick Walton Jr., 
the Wolverines (2-3 Big Ten, 12-6 
overall) responded emphatically 
in their next game 
against Nebraska 
(3-2, 
9-8) 
on 

Saturday.

Led by its own 

duo in sophomore

who 

scored 
23 
and 

21 
points 
and 

notched six and 
five 
rebounds, 

respectively — Michigan took 
its physicality to a new level and 
pulled out a 91-85 victory over the 
Cornhuskers.

“We just weren’t happy with 

the way we were playing,” Irvin 
said. “... Just being able to hit the 
reset button. This game was the 
beginning of a new season, and 
that’s what we wanted to key on, 
and we were able to do that.”

Irvin set the tone for the 

afternoon on the Wolverines’ very 
first possession, bursting into the 
paint and laying it off the glass to 
open the scoring. He went back 
to the basket time and time again 
throughout the game, forcing his 
way into the middle and heading 
to the rim without hesitation.

His first 10 points came off 

layups, and his fearless attitude 
opened up space on the outside 
for the Wolverines to exploit. On 
Michigan’s second trip up the 
court, he put on the same move 
that earned him his opening 
layup. But with the defense in 
ready position, he swung the 
ball out to an open Wagner on 
the perimeter instead. Wagner 
gladly repaid him, nailing the 
straightaway 3-pointer.

All seven of Irvin’s assists 

on the day led to 3-pointers — a 
career-high four for Wagner, two 
for Walton and one for redshirt 
sophomore DJ Wilson.

“Just trying to be able to make 

plays for myself downhill or for 
others, and really just trying to get 

to the free-throw 
line as well,” Irvin 
said. “Get some 
easy points, get 
into a rhythm and 
then that can set 
up for an array of 
other things.”

Left 

completely 
unmarked 
later 

in the first half, 
Wagner 
didn’t 

settle for another 3-pointer. He 
drove to the hoop through an 
open lane and threw down a one-
handed slam with the full force of 
his 6-foot-11 frame.

Wagner cut straight to the rim 

again with a minute left in the 
stanza, but his defender knocked 
him to the ground to prevent 
another highlight slam. Instead, he 
went to the foul line and sunk both 
attempts. He had four made free 
throws in the frame and would 
add three more in the second, as 
nearly a third of his career-high 
point total came from the charity 
stripe.

“We have just emphasized, 

‘Get two feet in the paint,’ ” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “… 
We’re trying to get guys to drive 

through that first bump, and they 
did it better a couple times today.”

The Wolverines, as a whole, 

benefited considerably from their 
trips to the free-throw line. They 
finished the first half 7-for-7 and 
the second 19-for-23 — 10 of which 
came from Irvin and Walton down 
the stretch while the Cornhuskers 
desperately attempted to launch a 
comeback.

Leading up to those free throws 

that closed out the game, Irvin and 
Wagner teamed up one more time 
to put the nail in Nebraska’s coffin. 
The pair executed a pick-and-roll, 
and instead of feeding Wagner, 
Irvin kept the ball and finished it 
off himself, laying it up once more 

to give Michigan a six-point lead it 
wouldn’t give up.

“We gotta be able to fight 

through adversity,” Irvin said. 
“We’re in a tough stretch right 
now, starting off 1-3, but being able 
to get a win against Nebraska is a 
step in the right direction. … This 
is when we find out what teams 
are made of and what we’re made 
of, and for us to be able to bounce 
back like this is huge.”

With the way the first two 

weeks of their conference season 
had gone, Irvin and Wagner 
understood the stakes, and the 
Cornhuskers simply couldn’t stop 
them from exerting their will on 
the game.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines motivated
by “white-collar” dig

After Wednesday’s loss at 

Illinois, Fighting Illini center 
Maverick Morgan said something 
that ticked off the Michigan men’s 
basketball team.

“They’re more of a white-collar 

team, traditionally,” Morgan said. 
“At Illinois we’re about toughness 
and together, not that they’re not. 
But we kind of pride ourselves 
on defense, and that’s something 
we’ve worked hard on.”

The “white-collar” comment 

from Morgan didn’t sit well with 
any of the Wolverines, and they 
took it personally.

“The white-collar comment 

that was made, we didn’t take that 
lightly,” said senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. after Michigan’s win 
against Nebraska on Saturday. 
“So when we heard that, it was 
basically attacking us personally. 
The white-collar comment that 
was made by an Illinois player 
really ticked this team off.”

Added 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
on Friday: “It doesn’t feel good. 
I’ve never seen myself as a white-
collar player or anything like that, 
so I especially don’t like that.”

After a lackluster performance 

against 
Illinois, 
in 
which 

Michigan’s 
defense 
allowed 

the Fighting Illini to shoot 64.2 
percent, the Wolverines needed 
to respond Saturday against the 
Cornhuskers.

In the “white-collar” comment 

from Morgan, they found their 
spark.

Back home at Crisler Center, 

Michigan 
was 
aggressive 

attacking the rim, which was 
evident in the second half, when 
they went into the bonus with 
over nine and a half minutes left to 
play as they beat the Cornhuskers, 
91-85.

“It’s motivation, certainly, for 

them,” said Michigan coach John 

Beilein after Saturday’s game. 
“I’ve talked about the edge. We do 
not have a bunch of white-collar 
kids. We have kids that are tough, 
hungry and trying to get better 
everyday.”

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner gave the Wolverines a big 
size advantage inside, and they 
attacked the paint early. Wagner 
was able to exploit the size 
advantage, scoring a career-high 
23 points.

But by the end of the game, it 

was Walton and senior guard Zak 
Irvin who took over for Michigan. 
The duo attacked the basket, 
creating opportunities and open 
shots that allowed the Wolverines 
to stay ahead of Nebraska, despite 
the Cornhuskers shooting almost 
60 percent in the second half.

“Tonight, we wanted to be 

more aggressive going to the 
basket and showing that we’re a 
group out there,” Walton said.

Now at 2-3 in the Big Ten, 

Michigan finds itself at a pivotal 
point in its schedule. With road 
games at No. 18 Wisconsin and 
Michigan State and a home 
matchup against Indiana, the 
Wolverines are hitting a tough 
portion of their schedule.

The win over Nebraska on 

Saturday 
afternoon 
wasn’t 

perfect. The Wolverines’ defense 
still gave up 85 points and 1.232 
points per possession. But it was a 
win, and wherever Michigan can 
find motivation is good for a team 
that Beilein has said “an edge” 
doesn’t comes naturally to.

Come 
next 
Saturday, 
the 

Wolverines 
won’t 
have 
any 

problem finding something to get 
fired up about.

Michigan will take on Illinois 

once again in Ann Arbor, and 
there will be no shortage of 
motivation.

 “We’ll have our chance to play 

them again,” Abdur-Rakhman 
said. “I don’t think it will be the 
same.”

‘M’ downs Minnesota
with balanced offense

Since the start of Big Ten 

play, the Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team 
(4-1 
Big 

Ten, 15-4 overall) has begun 
to solidify its identity as a 
collection 
of 
highly-skilled 

scorers, and that has never been 
more obvious than during its 
84-69 win against Minnesota 
on Sunday.

While the Golden Gophers 

(1-4, 10-8) were led by guard 
Carlie Wagner, who tallied 38 
of their 69 points, it was hard 
to 
notice 
her 
performance 

at 
times. 
Four 
Wolverines 

— sophomore center Hallie 
Thome, junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick and senior guard 
Siera Thompson — captured all 
the attention with double-digit 
performances of their own.

Just 14 seconds after tip-off, 

Thome started off the game 
with a layup, and she added six 
more points down low in the 
first quarter alone. Capitalizing 
on her size advantage in the 
paint, Thome set the tone for 
her eventual 20-point game.

Her 
interior 
dominance 

didn’t 
just 
help 
Michigan 

on offense, though. Thome 
notched 17 total rebounds to set 
a new career high, and earn her 
second straight double-double 
as well.

“She’s very much improved 

on her rebounding game, which 
I think helps us a lot,” Flaherty 
said. “Because it lets (the other 
team) not go and transition, 
and it gives us second chance 
opportunities. I’m very proud 
of her.”

Flaherty had an impressive 

showing as usual, knocking 
down four 3-pointers on seven 
attempts in the first half to 
widen the Wolverines’ lead to 
25 by halftime. Flaherty ended 
up leading the team in scoring 
— finishing with 22 points — 
after bypassing Thome’s tally 
with to back-to-back 3-pointers 
midway through the fourth 

quarter.

While 
Flaherty 
and 

Thome were trading baskets, 
Gondrezick was putting on a 
show herself. She racked up 
17 points, with three assists 
and three boards to boot. In 
the third quarter, especially, it 
looked as though Gondrezick 
might 
overtake 
her 
older 

teammates’ point totals, as she 
scored six points and showed no 
signs of slowing down.

“I think it’s just fun to have 

that many people that can 
score,” Flaherty said. “I think 
that’s really helped our team a 
lot. Kysre being added into the 
mix, someone who can score 
twenty points a game, that 
really relieves the pressure on 
us guards and Hallie as well.”

Not 
to 
be 
overlooked, 

Thompson tallied 12 points 
on 4-for-8 shooting, with four 
rebounds and seven assists as 
well. A product of her relentless 
tenacity all over the court, 
Thompson also earned four 
personal fouls, but she kept 
herself in the game with smart 
decisions on defense.

“I feel really comfortable 

today 
with 
my 
shot 
and 

attacking 
the 
basket,” 

Thompson 
said. 
“My 
game 

plan was to attack them and 
make 
them 
uncomfortable 

defensively, and I think we did 
that.”

For the second consecutive 

game, 
this 
quartet 
of 

Wolverines reached double-
digit scoring totals, and with a 
15-point win as the result, it is 
clear that any team that boasts 
scorers with the same level 
of productivity as Michigan 
should make opposing teams 
feel uneasy.

“I think we just have great 

balance,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “We 
always talked about it from 
the beginning of this season. 
The strength of our team is the 
balance of our team. I thought 
tonight they all clicked together 
at times, which was really great 
to see.”

Michigan remains undefeated at home

The Wolverines’ undefeated 

streak at Crisler Center this season 
is still intact. 

The perfect mark at home is 

something 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball coach Kim Barnes 
Arico was clearly excited about.

“Woo-hoo,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

exclaimed with a smile on her face. 
“We love playing here, we love 
playing at home. We’re proud. Our 
fan base has increased through 
the years. Our job is to protect the 
block ‘M’, that’s our responsibility. 
We want to get as many wins as we 
can at home, it definitely makes a 
difference.” 

On Sunday, Michigan’s (4-1 

Big Ten, 15-4 overall) latest 
opportunity to defend Crisler 
Center came against Minnesota 
(1-4, 10-8). It marked this season’s 
only matchup between the two, 
and the Wolverines claimed their 
victory handily, defeating the 
Golden Gophers, 84-69.

Hallie Thome and Katelynn 

Flaherty acted as Michigan’s 

dynamic duo. The sophomore 
center 
and 
junior 
guard, 

respectively, each put up eight 
points by the end of the first 
quarter, helping the Wolverines 
earn an early 25-16 lead. 

Though Michigan was only 

narrowly ahead of Minnesota 
halfway through the first quarter, 
the Wolverines began to widen the 
gap with the help of junior guard 
Jillian Dunston and senior guard 
Siera Thompson, who had two and 
three assists, respectively.

Freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick also helped to build 
the lead, as she wasn’t far behind 
Thome and Flaherty with five 
points at the end of the first 
quarter.

Roughly four minutes into the 

second quarter, the Wolverines 
finally broke the game open. 
Flaherty hit her third 3-pointer of 
the game, kickstarting a 12-point 
run 
that 
forced 
the 
Golden 

Gophers to call a timeout. 

By the end of the half, Michigan 

led by 25 points. Minnesota, on the 
other hand, had been held to just 
six points in the second quarter 

and notched just 22 total points 
by halftime. The Wolverines’ lead 
proved too difficult to overcome, as 
the Golden Gophers trailed by 20 
or more points for the remainder 
of the game. 

Despite 
getting 
into 
foul 

trouble, Thompson still managed 
to post 12 points and seven assists. 

“(Foul trouble) is something 

I try hard not to get frustrated 
with,” Thompson said. “It’s hard 
not to. Just feeling out the refs and 
figuring out how aggressive I can 
play, I have to adjust. That was my 
fault, figuring out how aggressive I 
need to be on defense.” 

With 
Thompson 
playing 

limited minutes, Flaherty and 
Thome continued to strike as 
a pair, finishing with 14 and 16 
points each in the second and third 
quarters, respectively. 

Thome completed her fourth 

double-double 
of 
the 
season, 

finishing with 20 points and 17 
rebounds. 

“She’s 
playing 
with 
some 

confidence,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think that’s really important. 
… Her teammates, us coaches, we 

just have such great confidence in 
her game. She’s incredible, she has 
the best hands of any post (player) 
I’ve seen.

“I think we’re doing a better job 

as a team of finding her and letting 
her go to work because we believe 
she can score against anyone 
inside.” 

By the end of the game, four 

Wolverines — Flaherty, Thome, 
Gondrezick and Thompson — had 
hit double digits.

“I think we shared the ball really 

well, which really, ultimately, led 
to us scoring in double figures,” 
Flaherty said. “In the first half we 
only had three turnovers, which 
is really our goal. … Today, we 
really clicked on all cylinders. I 
think if we can continue doing that 
throughout the Big Ten season, 
we’ll be really successful.” 

As 
expected, 
Michigan’s 

greatest competition came from 
Minnesota guard Carlie Wagner, 
who scored 38 of Golden Gophers’ 
69 points. But even Wagner’s 
valiant effort wasn’t enough to 
break the Wolverines’ perfect 
record at home.
