When Interim Athletic
Director Jim Hackett met with
the media Tuesday after decid-
ing to fire former Michigan
coach Brady Hoke, he empha-
sized the move wasn't an easy
one.
"When you make the deci-
sion to change someone's life,
you'd better take the time think
about it," Hackett said. "And, in
this case, I did take the time. I
was very deliberate about it."

considering Hoke's future was
how to best reconcile what he
believed were Hoke's values off
the football field and his team's
results on it.
Under Hoke, the Wolverines
went 12-12 in the Big Ten over
the last three years while going
2-6 against Michigan State and
Ohio State.
"I believe the longevity of our
best football coaches are tied to
the intersection of the perfor-
mance or measure of wins and
losses with the test and expres-
sion of values that underscore

pui yvIu, 1aW Lal.
"Everywhere I go, there is
zero question about Brady's
values.... Brady's peers - both
active and retired coaches -
really respect him, and his
players love playing for him.
He's done a great job of molding
these young men and focusing
them on success in the class-
room and in the community."
In the end, Hackett didn't
think Hoke's values were
enough to merit him keeping
his job for a fifth season. Hack-

While organizations across the
country sought donations this
'Giving Tuesday,' the University

launched its own initiative, 'Giv-
ing Blueday,' a one-day fundrais-
ing event as part of its ongoing
Victors for Michigan fundraising
campaign.
Over 24 hours, the University
aimed to bring in $1 million dol-
lars from around 1,000 donors, a
mark they reached in the first 13
hours.
By midnight, the University
raised $3,252,309 from 5,437

donors.
"When we set that goal, we
thought it was ambitious to raise
a million dollars from a thousand
people," said Tom Szczepanski,

opment. "I think it just shows
once again, that Michigan donors

Trips aim to

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT
Daily StaffReporter
Preparing for the demands
of medical school applications,
pre-med students are some of
the busiest on campus, but many

are still enticedby clinics abroad
as a means to demonstrate inter-
est and experience in the health
care field. These trips. are akin
to study abroad trips, focused
on overseeing medical work in a
often challenging environments.
However, a growing concern
within these clinics is whether
students are performing proce-
dures which are illegal under
the guidelines of the Association
of American Medical Colleges.

The AAMC guidelines state,
"Students should never engage
in any unsupervised activity
that is considered the practice
of medicine including, but not
limited to: diagnosing diseases,
administering narcotics, per-
forming , surgical procedures,
suturing or othertasks generally
reserved for the trained health

CSG resolution calls for on-
site admissions in Detroit

'Green ies 'findcommunity,
multi-culturalism in chorus

a

Practice would
demonstrate
commitment to
diversity, some argue
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
At the Central Student Govern-
ment meeting Tuesday night, sev-
eral resolutions were proposed,
including one that would support
on-site admissions to the Univer-
sity in Detroit high schools.
Additionally, a proposal to fund
the Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center's market-
ing materials and a resolution to
amend the CSG budget to allo-
cate funds to the Student Orga-
nization Funding Commission
were also discussed. A resolution
proposed Nov. 28 to help fund
the Golden Apple Award and the
corresponding lecture was unan-
imously passed as well.
-5M

The admissions resolution
calls for CSG to show its com-
mitment to a diverse campus by
supporting on-site admissions in
Detroit high schools. The student
assembly has previously stated
that it believes that this form
of recruitment is effective in a
resolution to increase minority
student enrollment, which was
passed during the Winter 2014
semester.
In the on-site admissions pro-
cess, admissions officers travel
to high schools to interview
students. Often in the same day
or shortly after, an admissions
officer reviews a student's appli-
cation and tells them if he or she
has been accepted.
"It sounds like a well thought
out plan," said Education senior
Michael Chrzan, a School of
Education representative.
Other CSG members had ques-
tions regarding why the Univer-
sity does not currently have an
on-site admissions process. Chr-
zan, an author of the resolution,
5-m

cited a 2002 Michigan Daily arti-
cle in which Sally Lindsey, the
associate director of admissions
at the time, said the University
does not hold on-site admissions
because it has a "very competi-
tive" admissions process.
Though the University of
Michigan-Dearborn has an on-
site admissions process, the Ann
Arbor campus does not. Other
universities such as Michigan
State University, the University
of Iowa and Western Michigan
University practice their own
variations of on-site admissions.
Some assembly members
wished the resolution better
defined the role CSG would take
in the practice's implementation.
"I just want to see some sort of
a formulation of a plan of how we
can actually get this policy insti-
tuted because I think it is really
important," said LSA Represen-
tative Bardia Vaseghi, an LSA
senior.
Engineering representative
Andy Modell, an Engineering
senior, referenced the disrup-
tion of last week's meeting
of the University's Board of
Regents by members of the
group By Any Means Necessary
and asked for the proposal to
explicitly state that the resolu-
tion would be peacefully imple-
mented.
BAMN members also
expressed their support of
on-site admissions during the
meeting.
"It was just the process (on-
site admissions) that made us
feel as that the university did
want students from my school
to come there," BAMN mem-
ber Leanna Mulholland said, in
regards to her own experience
with on-site admissions at her
Detroit high school.
The legislation was referred
to the resolutions committee
and will be voted upon at the
next CSG meeting.
The other resolutions at the
CSG meeting included a pro-
posal to support SAPAC, which
asked for $1,200 from CSG's leg-
islative discretionary account

58 Greene, founded
in 1993, is the second-
oldest student a
cappella group
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
Though the University has 16
a cappella groups, 58 Greene is
confident they are a little dif-
ferent.
The group, founded in the
basement of East Quad Resi-
dence Hall in 1993, was named
after the room in the East Quad
where the founding members
began practicing together.
Since then, the co-ed, multicul-
tural group aims to use their
varying backgrounds to create
a unique voice.
"Multiculturalism has
always been what we are and
also something that we strive to
promote through music perfor-
mance," said 58 Greene Direc-
tor Jillian Gray, an LSA senior.
"That has been the main com-
ponent of our legacy for the past
21 - almost 22 - years now."
While Gray acknowledges
that other groups value diversi-
ty as well, she said they are the.
only a cappella group on cam-
pus that identifies multicultur-
alism as part of their brand.
Gray added that their musi-
cal performances often aim to
raise awareness of social jus-
tice issues. 58 Greene performs
annually at the MLK Children
and Youth Day program on
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
But the group has quirkier
traditions, too.
"Part of the ritual of starting
every rehearsal is slapping the

butt of the person next to you,"
Gray said. "We send it around,
and then we send it back around
every single rehearsal."
This tradition is meant to
loosen up everyone before
rehearsal.,
"It's funny and lightens the
mood and makes you comfort-
able with people really quick
even if you weren't before,"
Gray added
The Greenies, as members
call themselves, have an com-
petitive yet informal fall audi-
tion process. The process has
the typical roundup of musical-
ity tests; among them are vocal
warmups, test ranges, sight
readings and a solo audition.
"Auditions are definitely
intimidating and a little scary,",-
Gray said.
Grey said there is also a
secret component of tryouts.
"The final part of the audi-
tion is something only we do
and it's a way in which we get
the personality out of people,"
Grey said. "We aren't just con-
cerned with whether or not
you can hold a tune but want
to know 'do we want to spend
10 hours a week with you in
rehearsal' and can you have fun
with us."
LSA sophomore Jin Kim,
58 Greene member, said the
58 Greene community is an
important aspect of her life at
the University.
"58 Greene is my family," she
said. "It is easy to get lost and
feel lonely at such a big school,
but Greenies have made me feel
a part of a caring community."
Kim added that 58 Greene is
diverse yet united in their pas-
sion for music.
"We are such different peo-
ple," Kim said. "People of dif-

ferentrace, background, gender
and preferences, but we come
together to create great music
and more importantly because
we care for each other."
LSA senior Schuyler Robin-
son, 58 Greene musical director,
expressed similar sentiments
about the a cappella group.
"58 Greene is incredible
because it not only supports
individual voices, both in and
outside the group, but also
harvests unity amongst this
incredible group of people,"
Robinson said.
The 14 Greenies perform
twice a year in the fall semester
concert in December and again
for a spring concert in sum-
mer. Gray said they retire songs
every three semesters and pick
up four new songs so that each
concert showcases a different
set of songs.
The guys and girls have a
chance to compete within 58
Greene with their annual tradi-
tion of a guys-versus-girls sing-
off during the fall concert.
"We make a little competi-
tion out of it," Gray said. "We
rehearse separately and secret-
ly for the whole semester and
then we come together a week
before our concert and perform
for each other. And we always
try to outdo each other. We are
a co-ed group so it's fun for us
to sometimes split up."
In spite of the battle of the
sexes, the group is close-knit
- extending beyond their years
at the University. At a recent
reunion, more than 50 alumni
came to Ann Arbor from all
over the country.
"Alumni (are) a huge part
of our legacy," Gray said. "We
really pride ourselves on really
maintaining connections."

Requests for -funding also
came from the SOFC resolu-

tion. The legislation asked for
funds from the reserve, com-
mission discretionary and leg-
islative accounts to allocate up
to $27,281.04 to SOFC. Due to
an increased request for fund-
ing from student organiza-

tions, SOFC is predicted to be
short approximately $21,000 to

Both resolutions were

"A constant concern is wonder-

with some students who said they

"Sometimes a small percent-

and that can be a big problem," he
said. "Medical schools don't need

Medical Educational Service
Opportunities and Humanity'
First are two of the on-campus
groups that offer these trips.
Both groups are primarily fund-
ed through fundraising efforts,
though MESO currently partners
with Princeton Review, a test

Neither MESO nor Human-
ity First require students to read
AAMC guidelinesbut Ross senior
Shazia Ijaz, Humanity First presi-
dent, said the rules are verbally
articulated to group members
during training sessions.
Humanity First is also a
national nonprofit. The Univer-

year and sets up a primary health

free care for people in need.
According to Ijaz, her organi-
zation works with Guatemalan

MESO takes a similar approach,

"I met with coach Hoke today

said interim Athletic Director

Jim Hackett in a statement. "This
was not an easy decision given
the level of respect that I have for

- even if that means renovating a
building that already exists.
"I think it's really important
that we have our own building
that is independent," Shetty
said.
Students asked about the func-
tionality of rooms in the proposed
Trotter Center, including ques-
tions about dance studio space
and if incense and candles could
be burned. Architects from Han-
bury, Evans, Wright, Vlattas +
Company, a firm from Norfolk,
Virginiaworkingwiththe Univer-
sity to build the new Center, said
students have repeatedly raised
concerns about practice space for
dance groups.
The architects said they hope
to have a multipurpose room,
which would accommodate for

the needs of a dance group.
The proposed spaces include a
wellness room, an outside porch,
a living room with a fireplace, a
reflection room and aballroom or
similar open space.
Trotter Center planners have
used a survey completed by 900
students and community mem-
bers to inform their.decisionmak-
ing. Site planners have researched
the locations students most fre-
quent to determine the location
of campus center and how to best
reach students.
Considerations for choosing a
location for the new Trotter Cen-
ter include expediting the occu-
pancy date as well as finding the
best, most cost-effective venue
and a stand-alone building easily
accessed by campus tour groups.

Planners also prefer that each
floor hold at least 300 people in
what will likely be a three-story
facility.
LSA junior Thamara Subrama-
nian said student input has been
present during every step of the
process, though architects are
still in the pre-planning phase
and it may be years before the new
Trotter Center is open.
"The planning committee has
been really open to all ideas,
regardless of attainability and
giving us background on what is
attainable," Subramanian said.
"It is hard to picture things when
we won't be here for when it

think it's really worth it to even-
tually see your input be put into
action."


branches: pre-med, pre-dentistry
and pre-pharmacy. Pre-med stu-
dents work in small groups with
a translator to ask patients ques-
tions and come up with a pre-
liminary diagnosis. Doctors then
assess the patient and go over
the course of treatment with stu-
dents.
Ijaz said Humanity First is
careful to make sure its members
stay within regulations.
"Students don't perform pro-
cedures; they shadow and they
assist. We've been very careful
about that and we're very aware
that's completely unethical and
illegal," she said. "Our students
get as close as possible, but our
doctors, physicians and supervi-
sors in Guatemala all know that
students should not be perform-
ing procedures."
Engineering junior Prady
Manepalli, who went on a
Humanity First trip last year, said
students were aware of their ethi-
cal limits.
"Anything we saw out of the
unusual, we referred to a doctor,"
he said. "We wouldn't take part in
anythinglike that."
Manepalli recounted handing
out medication to dentists to aid
pulling out teeth, learning how to
take blood pressure properly and
participating in information ses-
sions about the region.
Engineering senior Lindsay
Merlotti, MESO co-president,
said she has heard stories of
pre-dental-students-doing-nore-
hands-on procedures than neces-
sary.
"I know some people who did
dental got worried because the
dentists allow you to do a lot more
than the doctors allow you to do,"
she said.
She specifically noted tooth
extractions as a source of poten-
tial danger.
According to Merlotti, who
previously participated in a trip to
the Dominican Republic, pre-med

students in MESO do not perform
those kinds of procedures.
"You don't actually perform
anything on the patients aside
from listening to their breath-
ing on a stethoscope, some patel-
lar reflexes and some blood
pressure," she said. "I didn't do
anything that I felt was unethical
or beyond my skill level.
According to Brawn, medi-
cal school admissions directors
strongly value intellectual curios-
ity and cultural understanding.
"Good cultural training can
enhance your ability to learn from
other people," he said. "You want
to be able to the understand the
situation you're in. You go into
situations making assumptions
based on things that aren't true
for that population, then you're
not goingto understand what you
see."
Neither MESO nor Humanity
First include formal cultural edu-
cation in their training sessions.
"What we do talk about before-
hand is not specifically the cul-
ture, but more the widespread
epidemics that we see, the very
common illnesses they have and
the reasons for that and their style
of living," Ijaz said. "A lot of (cul-
tural training) does happen when
they are on the ground."
While multiple students noted
the personal benefits of partici-
pating in the trips, it is difficult to
quantify the overall impact of the
programs on local populations.
. "In thebeginning-of our -pro
gram we were kind of asking that
ourselves, because we give them
primary health care, but we didn't
really know the impact that we
were having," Ijaz said. "But what
has happened is that our Univer-
sity chapter (of Humanity First)
has inspired other universities to
start at their schools, so doing this
camp in Guatemala has become a
regular thing, so in that area, I
think it's made a huge difference."
"You try and give them advice

not only about the medicine but
also about lifestyle choices, too,"
Merlotti said. "Part of the hard
thing, though, is that it's just
a completely different culture
down there. What we take for
granted here, they don't have."
Both groups acknowledged
that "resume-building" is a major
motivation to join for many appli-
cants.
"They want to get that experi-
ence under their belt to use and
leverage it into interviews or pro-
cesses or whatever they're apply-
ing to," Ijaz said. "ButI also think
that the people who are going on
these trips are the people who
actually stand to benefit from it
because they get there and it real-
ly grows the 'wanting-to-help-
people' portion of them."
Brawn said medical schools
ultimately aim to gain a better
understandingof the applicant..
"Medical schools want a sense
of the kind of healer the person
is going to be: are you compas-
sionate, things like that," he said.
"You can go on these trips and do
some wonderful things and if you
explain them and convey them
well, then they can be very help-
ful."
Brawn also said serving in a
clinic and gaining experience
in the United States can be as
rewarding as service abroad.
"The point is communication
with people whose health has
been compromised and ideally,:
observation of medical processes
with the end goal being a more
mature and nuanced understand-
ing of medicine," he said. "You
don't have to go abroad for that."
In the end, Brawn said pre-med
students' passion is paramount.
"Well-intentioned people see
great need and want to do some-
thing about it," he said. "The key
is making sure that what one does
is legal, appropriate and genuine-
ly helpful."

GIVING
From Page 1A
said the busiest day for online
giving for the University is New
Year's Eve. Szczepanski said last
year, the University received
around $567,000 from 1,100
donors.
Based on the results from Giv-
ing Blueday, Szczepanski said
the event will likely continue in
the future.
The University asked stu-
dents, alumni and friends to
donate to a particular unit,
department or University orga-
nization of their interest. Some
private donors pledged to match
student donations.
Kat Walsh, director of student
engagement for the Office of
Development, said about 70 stu-
dent groups - including Dance
Marathon, the Michigan March-
ing Band and the Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter - participated in the event
and asked donors to give to their
organization. Walsh empha-
sized the importance of student
involvement inthe event.
"We want philanthropy to
be fun and empowering for stu-
dents," Walsh said. "There are
so many student organizations
that are fundraising and advo-
cating for amazing causes here
at Michigan and beyond. We felt
this would be a really great way
for them to fundraise on this
day."
Tents wvere set up on the
Diag and at Pierpont Commons,
accompanying campus activities
throughout the day. Olympic ice
dancers Meryl Davis and Char-
lie White, both LSA students,
encouraged students to par-
ticipate by donating to a club or
issue they are passionate about
to increase their student experi-
ence.
"A big part of being a student

at the University of Michigan
isn't only the amazing academic
opportunities, but everything
else Michigan has to offer,"
Davissaid. "Ifyoudon'ttakepart
in campus activities, being part
of the these amazing organiza-
tions and support everything we
have, you're really missing out
on a lot of the life of Michigan." .
Ross graduate student Jaime
Ziegler, graduate chair of the
Victors for Michigan campaign's
Student Campaign Committee,
said it's understandable if stu-
dents could not donate due to
financial reasons.
"I understand that everyone
is feeling a financial squeeze
and tuition is really expen-
sive," Ziegler said. "I absolutely
respect that. I am experiencing
it myself."
However, Ziegler said the cost
does not outweigh the benefits of
beinga student at the University.
"Everyone should be aware
thattheirtuition actuallydoesn't
cover their cost of their experi-
ence here at Michigan," she said.
Similarly, White said the deci-
sion to donate is left to each stu-
dent.
"Obviously, it's up to the
students what they feel like
they want to support," he said.
"This isn't to support other's
educations. This is to support
programs that are going to be
helping people or giving oppor-
tunities to things that students
are interested in."
Engineering freshman Ankit
Shah said he would like to see
money go to the College of Engi-
neering given his current enroll-
ment. He said this fundraising
event is an opportunity for stu-
dentstoinformUniversityPresi-
dent Mark Schlissel about issues
on campus.
"We need to make sure we
give him feedback where we
want the money to go," he said.

tion of Hoke's job performance.
"We should be writing about
what kind of program he built
based on the values, but we
didn't have the results on the
field," he said.
Hackett made his decision
Sunday night and briefly met
with Michigan's players at
3 p.m. Tuesday before Hoke
spoke with them.
The search for a new coach
will begin immediately, and
Hackett plans to meet with the
players again for their input.

Hackett said he will hire a
headhunting firm to aid him
in the search process, but
explained he's not going to
rush the decision.
"The head coach of Michigan
football is one of the finest jobs
in American sports today, and
we will have great options,"
Hackett said. "The University
of Michigan remains one of the
top programs in the country."
In the interim, Sports
Administrator Mike DeBord
will oversee day-to-day aspects
of the program until a coach is
hired. Hackett said DeBord
is not a candidate for the .full-
time job.


are not there. In the end, I feel
that moving in a different direc-
tion is the right decision. I wish
Brady and his family all the best
in the future."
Because Hoke was let go before
Dec. 31, his buyout is $3 million.
Had he been fired on or after Jan.
1, 2015, his buyout would have
dropped to $2 million.
Hoke was signed to a six-year
contract before the 2011 season
that included a $1.5 million stay
bonus this offseason. Excluding
game-specific incentives, the for-
mer coach would have averaged
$3.25 million per year had he ful-
filled the entirety of his contract.
But Michigan went just 31-20
under Hoke and never reached
the Big Ten title game.
"I feel very fortunate to have
been an assistant and head coach
at the University of Michigan,"
Hoke said in a statement. "I will
always support the University
and this football program. This
is a special place and one that

Laura, Kelly and I have enjoyed
representing during our time in
Ann Arbor. I want to thank all
of the sons that played for our
teams and appreciate the com-
mitment that our coaches and
support staff made to the pro-
gram every day.
"I will miss the relationships
that I've been fortunate enough to
make within this university and
community. I additionally appre-
ciate all of the support that our
fans, alumni, students, adminis-
tration and former players have
provided our program. I leave
with fond memories of my experi-
ence at Michigan. Thanks and Go
Blue!"
Hoke's first season with the
Wolverines was also his best. In
2011, Michigan went 11-2 with
wins over Notre Dame and Ohio
State. and an overtime triumph
against Virginia Tech in the
Sugar Bowl.
The Wolverines dropped to 8-5
in 2012, 7-6 in 2013 and then 5-7

this fall, losing five of six to the
Buckeyes and Michigan State in
that span.
Hoke entered 2014 on the hot
seat, and further lost public sup-
port during the fifth week of the
season, when, in the fourth quar-
ter of a blowout defeat to Min-
nesota, he failed to pull Shane
Morris ina timely manner despite
the quarterback's difficulty to
stand following a helmet-to-hel-
met hit.
But criticism of Hoke had gen-
erally stemmed less on that indi-
vidual incident and focused more
on the coach's win-loss record, his
teams that worsened from year to
year and his perceived struggle to
develop talent.
Michigan has yet to name
Hoke's replacement, but San
Francisco 49ers coach Jim Har-.
baugh, Baltimore Ravens coach
John Harbaugh and LSU coach
Les Miles have all been rumored
as potential candidates for the

A new age o audio

Final words: To myself the 'U'and my resilient peers

t's gotten to that point in the semester
where I will literally find any excuse
not to do the work I
need to be doing. I desire to
be distracted. I know this
must be true for many, dare
I say most, college students.
We've been bogged down g
by the grind of the semes-
ter; Thanksgiving break was
approaching and has now
passed, so it's a little chal-
lenging to get back into the DEREK
school routine once again. WOLE
To make a long story
short, those factors explain
how I jumped into the
world of the podcast - for the uninformed,
podcasts are essentially prerecorded radio
shows that cover just about everything and
can be directly downloaded to your phone
or computer. Before mid-November, I had
really only known podcasts as that app on
my iPhone that I don't use and a recording
option on Garageband, which I have also
never used. And yet, even with the limited
experience I've had over the past couple
of weeks, I'm not sure I ever want to leave
this brave, new world. Because even though
there are so many great TV shows out there,
there's something special about excellent,
educational and informative audio.
It started with a tweet from one of my
followers about "Serial," the hit real-life
murder mystery show hosted by Sarah
Koenig, a producer of "This American Life."
With nine episodes to this point, "Serial"
chronicles a murder that took place in the
Baltimore area in 1999. Koenig has spent the
last year or so researching the case to try to
determine if Adnan Syed, the ex-boyfriend of
Hae Min Lee, was the one who killed her and
is releasing an episode week-by-week. I'm
sure that description does not do it justice.
I became a hooked listener instantly, so
upon hearing at the end of the ninth episode-
that the show would be taking a two-week
hiatus for Thanksgiving, I was kind of
devastated. It's that good. As of now, it isn't
clear what the end result will be for Syed and I
don't want to spoil it, but it's truly fascinating
and I recommend that everyone take a listen.
I'm counting down until Thursday.
But "Serial" hasn't been the only podcast
show that has piqued my interest. "Startup,"
a show about Alex Blumberg, a former NPR
staffer, beginning his startup company,
Gimlet Media, has been impossible to put
down - or turn off, I guess. He even admits

to the title and premise being "meta."
He's right about that. I also believe
Blumberg might be right about his big gamble
in producing this show and what he really
believes in, that the podcastingworld is going
to explode. He told TechCrunch, "We're on
the dawn of a second golden age of audio."
That's an enormous bet - something Elon
Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, would probably
say. But in order to get there, the rest of the
podcasting content has to be top notch.
"Startup" is professional, well edited, but
also quirky and deeply personal. Blumberg
connects with the listener and tells a story
that has been underreported - the emotional
side of starting a business. Gimlet Media's
other and newer show, "Reply All," has done
the same so far and has been successful with
its shows relating to the Internet.
But that's enough of reviewing shows. I'll
leave that to our Arts section.
What I want to continue with is that there
has been a lot of debate on the Internet as to
whether shows like "Serial" and "Startup"
have changed the game in the podcasting
universe. Some say yes, some say no. After
having invested several hours into listening
to these shows and then reading the articles,
I'm ready to have some skin in the game -
from an opinion standpoint, that is. I find
myself leaning toward yes.
Although it has been around for years,
I find the podcast to be a new, fresh way to
educate myself on important, and even not
so important, issues. It has a different vibe
than radio and there clearly is a demand for
it. "Serial" broke the iTunes podcast down-
load record with over five million by Nov. 18.
In an episode of "Startup," Blumberg made a
call for investments to complete his goal of
raising $1.5 million. He raised $200,000 in a
couple of hours.
There's clearly a market for this high-
quality content. And if these two shows
continue to be successful, then that will
certainly drive others to make great shows,
too, to get a piece of the multi-million dollar
pie. So far, it's an untapped market. There's
some basic economics for you.
This is a future I want to be a part of.
Recently, I've begun to crave well-done
storytelling. The podcast is a premiere
medium for that. Besides, watching TV is
overrated anyway.
Well, at least until "Better Call Saul"
premieres.

This is my last column for
The Michigan Daily. These
are my
parting words for
myself, for this
University and for
the people who
never cease to
amaze me.
To Myself: Y
Maja, you must
do something.
Graduation MAJA
is looming very TOSIC
closely, but all I
can focus on is
how much this
University has tried to break me.
I cannot say that I am leaving as
someone who's happy and pleased. I
am leaving the University angered,
hurt and disheartened. Within
these walls, I have seen the true
workings of our education system.
Despite how broken I am to see
University administrators not take
action where action is due, what
breaks me the most is that I need
this University more than it needs
me. This institution has snared me
so strongly that I rely upon this
problematic system. To them, I am
just another dollar sign that is eas-
ily replaced, but to me they are my
key, my voice, my respect. With-
out this institution, I would not
have this stage from which to be
heard. I would not have the same
doors opening before me. I would
not be as respected and listened
to. Ironically, as much as I despise
aspects of this University, it has
also advanced my privilege. I can-
not lie to myself and say that I am
not grateful. But, I also cannot lie to
myself and say that I am pardoned

from the responsibility of challeng-
ing this institution even when I am
far gone. I am forever tied to this
place; therefore, I am forever tied
to the silence I must break.
Maja, you cannot let future gen-
erations become just as angered,
hurt and disheartened as they too
graduate from the University of
Michigan. You must do something.
To the University:
It's not you, University of
Michigan. Your conception was
pure, but it's these people who sit
highly in your buildings that have
tarnished you. They have poisoned
your integrity with greed for more
green. They have ruined your value
of education when they overlooked
the way racism an.d sexismenter the
classroom. Perhaps you have never
lived up to your true intentions,
because you were never free of
these people. I hope that one day
you find yourself ablaze in flames
and fury. I wish all your walls come
crashing down, because it was not
you that built them. They were built
by the wrong people. They were
built as shields to protect privilege
and power and notas hosts of multi-
dimensional growth and liberation.
In the midst of your ashes, I hope
that all the voices who value the
true possibility of education will
rebuild your containers stronger
than before. Then, your spirit
will finally flow freely without
oppression and injustice keeping
you down. I dream that you become
what you are meant to be.
To My Resilient Peers:
I will not paint this column
completely in sorrow. My radical
act is to pour what compassion and
love is left within me and to extend
it to you. Despite the hatred we are

taught to have for ourselves and
neighbors, I will not comply.
There are beautiful souls at
this University that wake up each
morning with a purpose. Some
of them go to class and some
skip class. Some study from their
textbooks and some refuse to buy
intellectualized andracisthistories.
Some learn through professors and
some learn through the narratives
that surround them. They are all
different in the ways they navigate
and survive at this University.
But, none of them lay still as this
institution tries to bury them. Their
words and actions regardless of
size are acts of resistance. Their
joy and compassion are testaments
to their strength in face of an
institution that fears them. I have
had the honor of meeting several
people that do not put their heads
down when they are told to. That
do not remain silent when they are
silenced. That do not spread hatred
when they are washed within it.
I have grown with some of these
folks and have admired many more
from a distance. Sadly, I know that
there are many hearts that beat to
this same tune that I will never
meet. For you, I write this.
I hope that you will continue
to find your source of darkness no
matter what light surrounds you.
Because, light can be blinding and it
takes a pocket of darkness to read-
just views. I hope you find some-
thing that shakes your core and
moves you to act. I hope that you
live life intentionally and never lose
sight of your passions. I hope that
you are happy and loved. Forever.

SIMON RIVERS I
I am Michael Brown

On Nov. 10, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel delivered an
honest and therefore controver-
sial assessment of the University's
Athletic Department to the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs. Schlissel noted, among
other things, the historic academic
underperformance of University
athletes, especially high-profile
ones like football players, and the
continuing obstacles to their aca-
demic success. Ina follow-up inter-
view with The Michigan Daily
the next day, Schlissel "clarified"
(i.e. recanted) some of his previ-
ous remarks - but the follow-up
interview and ensuing article failed
to address the message hidden in
Schlissel's initial comments: I'd
like to revisit the line of argument
Schlissel began to articulate on that
Monday and follow it to its logical
and therefore probably controver-
sial conclusion - namely, that the
pairing of university-level academ-
ics and high-profile college athlet-
ics, like Division I NCAA football,
doesn't make sense anymore, espe-
cially not for highly exploited, high-
profile student-athletes.
Speaking to SACUA, Schlis-
sel made important insights into
the economics of college athletics.
The Daily reported that Schlis-
sel "addressed the motivations for
athletic departments to value per-
formance over academic integrity."
He said, "The incentives are really
strong for (athletic ,departments)
to be as successful on the field as
possible, and some of those are in
dollars and others are in perfor-
mance." SACUA member Robert
Ziff, an engineering professor, cor-
roborated Schlissel's argument. The
Daily reported that Ziff "believes
student-athletes have an 'extreme
amount of demands placed on them'
as a result of their status, and that
they're often made to feel that the
'$100 million Athletic Program is
riding on them,' which could con-
tribute to decreased performance
in the classroom and elsewhere."
When one considers the econom-
ic incentives at play for high-profile
student-athletes, the supposedly
problematic result of football play-
ers shirking their schoolwork
should surprise no one. What
Schlissel and Ziff are saying is that
these student-athletes have been
incentivized to focus on success
on the field above and beyond suc-
cess in the classroom, and they're
correct. Not only does their ath-
letic performance influence their
individual chances to play profes-

sionally, but it also influences the
profitability of Michigan football.
Blaming Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke - who, by the way,
has actually improved the football
program's academic performance
- and the football players for get-
ting bad grades (which it turns out
they actually aren't) ignores the
real economic incentives motivat-
ing their actions. High-profile stu-
dent-athletes, like the University's
own football and basketball players,
would be idiots not to react to such
great incentives. They're not idiots,
I claim, and so they quite rationally
choose to focus less on academic
performance and more on their ath-
letic performance.
How, then, should we understand
the University's academic standards
for student-athletes as well as the
NCAA guidelines (e.g. capping the
number of hours student-athletes
can practice and compete)? In short,
they're an absurd hindrance to ath-
letic development. These standards
and guidelines try to create incen-
tives to compete with the more
powerful, already existing ones.
A coach telling his player to study
is not as powerful an incentive as,
say, Stephen M. Ross's $100 million
investment in the University Ath-
letic Department, nor as powerful
as a professional athlete's starting
salary. Furthermore, these artifi-
cial, reactionary incentives and the
rules and regulations that embody
them conceal the fact that the term
"student-athlete" is, for many high-
profile student-athletes, a gross
misnomer. Their first and foremost
reason for college enrollment is to
play sports. I suspect - and indeed
there's evidence that suggests -
that many have little genuine inter-
est in earning college degrees, and
that's fine, just as I have little inter-
est in playing college-level sports.
So although I maintain that these
high-profile athletes aren't idiots
when it comes to recognizing and
responding to economic incentives,
they are indeed fools. They are fools
because they believe that they must
abide by these rules and regulations
at all, and maintain a certain GPA
or practice for a certain number of
hours. But more so they are fools
because they believe that they must
accept scholarships instead of genu-
ine salaries. The institution of col-
lege athletics, headed by the NCAA
and its constituent colleges, has
foisted a false consciousness onto
its workers (the student-athletes),
making student-athletes believe
that there is no alternative to their

current work-for-scholarship busi-
ness arrangement. But the truth is
that the student-athletes; particu-
larly the high-profile ones, decide
whether or not the University and
the NCAA, along with their rules
and regulations, have power or not.
In other words, the college athletic
establishment's power depends on
the high-profile student-4thletes
agreeing and consenting to the
establishment's power. Once these
student-athletes realize this funda-
mental fact, their own agency will
be illuminated and they will have a
choice to make. Do they choose to
consent to the NCAA and the Uni-
versity's rules and regulations? Do
student-athletes consent to caps on
how long they can practice and com-
pete? Do they consent to being paid
with scholarships instead of genuine
salaries? Whythe fuck would they?
When people discuss the problem
of high-profile athletes' academic
underperformance, people seldom
ask the question of why these
athletes are students anyway. Do
they want to be, or would they
rather just play sports? People often
don't consider that this problem is
one that we can simply eliminate by
no longer demanding high-profile
athletestoperformacademically; or,
conversely, by high-profile athletes
refusing to perform academically
and demanding fair wages for their
work. Why are colleges in the sports
business anyway? Whose interests
does this system serve? High-
profile student-athletes may want
to consider why they're stuck eating
in dining halls while the Board of
Regents eats at The Chop House.
I propose we fully partition
academics and high-profile,
currently "pre-professional"
athletics. Indeed, the partition
already partially exists, and our
University president realizes it.
Student-athletes should not expect
that the benefactors of the current
institution of college athletics (the
universities, the NCAA, media
corporations, etc.) will voluntarily
relinquish their power and in turn
fairly compensate student-athletes
for their work. The high-profile
student-athletes should seize the
power themselves, and they can do
so effortlessly by simply refusing
to continue to acknowledge the
pretentious authority of the
University and the NCAA. Student-
athletes of the world, unite! You
have nothing to lose but your meal
plans and your textbooks.

"people's tendency to place an
undue emphasis on internal
characteristics to explain
someone else's behavior
in a given situation, rather
than considering external
factors." The first lesson I
draw from "Do the Right
Thing" is this: Ranging from
the current sociological
factors that maintain our
respective statuses as well as
the historical factors that have
led us all to our current places
in the world, appreciating and
accepting the complexities of
one another's identities and
how these identities interact
to produce a community
is imperative for resolving
interpersonal and intergroup
conflict when it arises.
Broadening our minds in this
manner can prevent us from
committing the fundamental
attribution error, which too
often fosters hate, violence and
destruction, and instead can
lead us to understanding, love
and creation.
The rioting in the film and in
Ferguson pains me personally
for many reasons, not least of
which is its thoughtlessness.
In "Do the Right Thing," one
line by the owner of the market
across from Sal's speaks to the
absurdity of the often self-
destructive nature of rioting.
When the mob has finished
destroying the pizzeria, they
turn on the Korean-owned
market across the street. The
Korean owner waves his broom
side-to-side in vain, trying to
deter the mob, and he says to
the mob in broken English:
"I Black. You, me: the same."
Despite what mightbe the more
salient differences between the
groups in the community (skin
color, accents, etc.), they are all
more or less the same, as we all
are.
Looting local businesses
only perpetuates the shared
economic deprivation of the
community. The end goal, it
seems to me, should be creative
local initiatives to address
the community's issues. This
approach will lead to more
constructive and overall better
solutions.
But what do I know? I'm just
a film writer.

actually works. "Faking It"
has found the balance between
being ironically dramatic, and

In "Busted," Amy (Rita Volk,

for her to apologize for sleeping

"The Good Wife" 's cast
has been its saving grace this
season; no matter how terrible

that cast. Given how well the
show uses the New York City
pool of actors, it's like watching
a Broadway play each week. By
bringing in people like Pierce,
Taye Diggs ("Private Practice")
and Steven Pasquale ("Do No

have built a supporting
repertory bursting with talent,
increasing the potency of even
the writers' worst ideas.
Ultimately, that's going to be
the thing that saves this show
from completely collapsing.
Even when there are misfires,
the series will always have
something to make it worth
watching. With the depth of
its ensemble and the quality of
stories past, it should be able to
move on from its problematic
political storyline into
something better.

is faithful to the the original

These are both rather tangential

These new endgame additions
may not be enough to justify
the purchase for those already
overly familiar with "Ruby and

to relive excellent childhood

of paint, picking up "Omega

no-brainer.

your favorite artist. tush of
emotions washes over you -
excitement, obviously; fear
that the tickets have already
sold out and slight confusion as
to how all your musical dreams
could come true for just a little
more than what you spent
on your last late night trip to
Pizza House.
You look tp the location,
finding that, as per usual,
with cheaper tickets come
smaller venues. This may
deter some show-goers, but
not me. There is something far
more interesting about being
cramped into a space that feels
like the size of a dorm room
than attending an arena show
where binoculars are usually
needed to even catch a glimpse
of the performer's elbow.
Last year, I saw Kanye West
perform atthe Palace ofAuburn
Hills on his Yeezus tour.
While being in the presence
of a "god" was incredible, the
ticket price was not. Paying
nearly $200 for concert tickets
seems outrageous. Though
my seats were floor level and
close enough to the stage to see
every ridiculous detail, it still
was not as powerful had the
venue not been so large. After
this experience, I decided to
lay off the arena tours for a
while. Sorry, Yeezy.
My adventures in this
change in scenery comes a
different concert experience,
though some things remain
unchanged. Some would think
that in venues fit for smaller
audiences, people would not be
as eager to push towards the
stage or cluster together - they
are wrong. Just because the
furthest away you can possibly
be from the stage is a whopping
15 feet does not mean that
people, myself included, will
not try to slowly inch their way
to the front. Most don't see this
eagerness as overly aggressive
or obnoxious; everyone just
wants an up close experience.
The ability to see musicians,
and artists of any kind
really, up close makes the
performance seem so much
more honest. They become
real people in our eyes, rather
than just a voice or an album
cover you have seen and
heard hundreds of times. The

performers present themselves
just as they are, without using
distance to cloud or deceive
audiences. The quainter the
setting, the more you are able
to notice little quirks and even
flaws - hey, the guitarist is
sweating! I sweat, too! I bet
you would never be able to see
Beyonce sweating at one of her
shows.
With a smaller crowd
comes an expectation of
audience decorum. More low-
key shows are not the place to
make your most killer fashion
statement or to try violently
elbowing your way to the front
of the crowd. It's best to wear
something comfy-casual, go
with the flow. I have found
that these "rules" are followed
most of the time - but not
always. I had the unfortunate
experience of attending a Man
Overboard show with about
50 other people, only to be
pressed up against a tall girl
wearing an oversized, fuzzy
wool coat and heels for the
majority of the main act. Don't
be that girl. Please.
Up close
performances
are more honest.
But for the most part,
these shows create a sense of
community among audience
members. There is something
to be said for a group of
strangers making the trek to
a slightly sketchy club/bar/
basement for the exact same
reason - to hear some great
music. Though arenas house
thousands of people, it is
much easier to connect with
those around you when with a
smaller group of people. Even
little things like singing along
to the same song create bonds
we aren't even aware of. Arenas
are impressive, but small
venues leave impressions. It is
undeniably impactful to be in
an intimate space surrounded
by those who also appreciate
the art that you love, all the
while only feet away from
favorite artists.

W MENCS BASKETBALL
SWolverines edge 'Cuse

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily
Athletic Director Jim Hackett said he has created "swim lanes" to find Michigan's next coach, but did not reveal names.
Big nameshighlight eM's

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
All night long, sophomore
guard Spike Albrecht made a
sold-out
Crisler SYRACUSE 65
Center MICHIGAN 68
come to
its feet with crisp passes. But it
wasn't until he knocked down a
deep 3-pointer with 31 seconds
left in the game that the crowd
was cheering its loudest as he
helped Michigan edge Syracuse,
68-65.
Three times prior in the
second half, Albrecht put the
crowd on its feet - and he didn't
even have to score.
Early in the frame, Albrecht
drove to his right and dished
a crisp behind-the-back pass
to forward Ricky Doyle. The
freshman brushed off contact
and finished with a dunk then
knocked down a free throw to
complete the and-1 play, giving
the Wolverines (6-1) the lead.
Nine minutes later, with 7:49
left on the clock, Albrecht found
Doyle again. This time, the
junior guard pushed a bounce
pass to him and the 6-foot-9
forward finished with another
dunk, bringing the Wolverines'
lead to seven points.
Then, with just under two
minutes left and the shot clock
expiring, Albrecht took the ball
from the top .of the are, drove
toward the paint and dished to
the left block where Doyle was
waiting for him again. Doyle
missed the first shot he put up
but tipped in a second-chance
opportunity.
After , the game, Michigan
coach John Beilein said he tells
Albrecht, " 'Spike, shoot when.
you're open. Pass it when you're
not.' It's pretty simple."
Nine times, Albrecht passed
the ball to someone else in a
maize and blue jersey who
finished with a basket, and
eight times he opted to shoot
- knocking down four of those

attempts attempts and three
beyond the arc.
"Spike is really good attacking
the zone, he sees behind the
zone," Beilein said. "He makes
that entry pass into the high-
post area better than anybody,
so that's why we had him out
there so much."
Doyle, after having a breakout
game against Oregon during the
Progressive Legends Classic,
and putting up 15 points on
Saturday against Nicholls State,
finished with another strong
stat line,recording12 points and
six boards.
Syracuse tied the game
with 56 seconds left, and cut
Michigan's lead to only one after
Albrecht's late three, but the
Orange (5-2) were forced to foul,
sending Michigan to the line.
The Wolverines did
everything they could to give
away the game, but Syracuse
couldn't take advantage.
Sophomore guard Derrick
Walton Jr. missed on a 1-and-i
attempt, but the Orange were
unable to regain possession,
throwing a rebound out of
bounds.
Sixsecondslater,juniorguard
Caris LeVert went to the line to
try and ice the game, but he too
missed a 1-and-1 attempt. This
time Syracuse brought the ball
down the court but it couldn't
hold on to it, losing control as
the ball slipped out of bounds.
Following another Syracuse
foul, LeVert went to the line for
a second 1-and-1 attempt and
knocked down two free throws
to put Michigan up three points
- this time for good.
A 3-point attempt from
Syracuse fell short at the
buzzer to give Michigan its
first marquee win of the season.
Albrecht might have captured
most of the attention at the
pointguard position,butWalton
started the game after being
called a game-time decision on
Monday due to a left toe injury.
Be11ienid Walton told him he

was OK to play just 10 minutes
before tip-off and he wanted
to start Walton when he was
stretched out as opposed to
starting Albrecht and bringing
Walton in off the bench.
The two guards shared
minutes throughout the game,
but neither tould get the offense
going in the first half, as it shot
13-of-36 in the first frame.
In the first 20 minutes,
Michigan and Syracuse battled
back and forth with neither
team able to get shots to go. The
Wolverines started the game
0-for-7fromthe field, struggling
to get shots to fall over the
Orange's 2-3 zone defense. But
Syracuse's shooting woes kept
them from running away with it
early. Save for forward Rakeem
Christmas, who shot 5-for-6
from the field in the half, the
Orange went just 6-for-19 in the
frame.
Sophomore forward - Zak
Irvin kept Michigan in the
game throughout the first half,
knocking down two 3-pointers
and scoring 12 points. In the
second stanza, Irvin helped the
Wolverines push the lead to 10
- their largest lead of the game
- with just over seven minutes
to go to give it some breathing
room. He finished with a game-
high18 points.
Michigan's ability to get shots
to fall in the second half and to
start attacking the rim allowed
them to break down Syracuse's
defense.
"We were more aggressive in
the second half," LeVert said.
"In the first half we were kind of
conservative. We weren't really
penetrating to get in the middle
of it. In the second half, (the
ability to penetrate) opened it
up and we knocked down some
shots."
The Orange didn't hold back
at the end, and it used a couple
of late jumpers to cut the lead
and tie it, but sloppy play at the
end ultimately cost them an
onnortunity to get aead.n

After Brady Hoke was fired
Tuesday, Michigan Athletic
Director Jim Hackett now
turns to the task of finding his
replacement. He has a later start
than schools such as Florida
and Nebraska, who fired Will
Muschamp and Bo Pelini,
respectively. Muschamp was
fired nearly two weeks ago, and
Pelini was released of his head
coaching duties Sunday.
But what Hackett doesn't have
in time, he has in talent.
Michigan's brand and prestige
don't have the same luster it
did before Rich Rodriguez was
hired, though. How Hackett goes
about his search will, in part,
depend on those willing to take
on the challenge.
The Daily breaks down
potential candidates to become
the Wolverines' next head coach,
in no particular order or rank.
Dan Mullen, head coach,
Mississippi State:
Background: Mullen has led
the Bulldogs to a 10-2 record
this season, having lost only
to Alabama and Ole Miss. He's
46-29 at Mississippi State and has
developed a team that once sat at
the bottom of the SEC West into a
top-10 team nationally, including
a brief stay atop the polls. Prior
to Mississippi State, Mullen was
the offensive coordinator under
Urban Meyer at Florida and
served as a quarterbacks coach at
BGSU and Utah.
Pros and cons: Mullen is young
and he has experience against
big-name programs and in the
postseason. His track record
at turning around a program is
noteworthy, but his record in the
Southeastern Conference isn't
nearly as good.
Could it happen? Mullen will
certainly be pursued, but it will
be tough to convince him to leave
an already successful program
and go back to rebuilding.
Craig Bohl, head coach,
Wyoming:
Background: You probably
haven't heard of Bohl, but
perhaps you heard about the
powerhouse at North Dakota
State. Bohl, who finished 4-8 this
season, is in his first year with
the Cowboys. But he built the
Bison into a formidable program
in 10 years, winning three
consecutive Division I national
championships in his final three
seasons.
Pros and cons: Bohl has built
a program before and knows
how to make the most of less-
heralded players. He'd be more
than willing to take over a big
program and could handle the
transition process well. But he
has never regularly faced a Big
Ten-caliber schedule or played
against other Power 5 opponents.
Could it happen? Michigan
shied away from bringing in a
popular name last time, so it
could do so again if things don't
work out with the bigger names.
But the Wolverines will seek out

a proven name this time before
turning to a backup option. If
Bohl had a couple more years at
Wyomingto findsuccess it would
seem more plausible.
Les Miles, head coach, LSU:
Background: You might
remember Les Miles as the
original choice to replace Rich
Rodriguez in 2010 before Brady
Hoke was hired. Miles is 131-
49 at LSU and Oklahoma State,
holding a 7-5 record in bowl
games. He won the National
Championship in 2007 with LSU.
Pros and cons: Miles played
under Bo Schembechler and has
the experience at a big name
program that fans clamor for.
He has beaten top teams in the
SEC and would bring his strong
recruitinggprowess to Ann Arbor.
Miles is 61, though, and he
wouldn't necessarily be a long-
term option for a program that
looks to restore its consistent
success.
Could it happen? Miles is also
in a secure position since LSU is
a safe bet to finish with nine or 10
wins every season. But he's long
been tied to Michigan and could
wrap up his coaching career at
the place he started playing.
Tom Herman, offensive
coordinator, Ohio State:
Background: Herman doesn't
have any experience as a head
coach, but he spent the past nine
years as an offensive coordinator
at Ohio State, Iowa State, Rice
and Texas State. He's found
success at each school, most
recently coaching some of the
Big Ten's best offenses at Ohio
State. He turned freshman J.T.
Barrett into the conference's best
quarterback in just one year.
Pros and cons: Herman could
be an answer to Michigan's
offensive woes this season
and would be able to develop
sophomore quarterback Shane
Morris into all that he was
projected to be. But leaving
Ohio State for its biggest rival
might not be feasible. And most
importantly, he still lacks head
coaching experience.
Could it happen? It's not likely
that Michigan would turn to a
coordinator, though it wouldn't
be unprecedented. Still, there are
bigger names out there before
the Wolverines turn to Herman.
David Shaw, head coach,
Stanford:
Background: At 7-5, Shaw
may be having a down year,
but his track record has
otherwise turned him into a
solid candidate. In his first three
seasons at Stanford, Shaw led
his teams to the Fiesta Bowl
and consecutive Rose Bowls.
He coached for four years under
current San Francisco 49ers
coach Jim Harbaugh.
Pros and cons: Shaw is
a winner, and he's proven
capable of developing talented
quarterbacks such as Andrew
Luck and Kevin Hogan. But he's
also settling into a program that
he played and coached for, so

poaching him would be tough.
Could it happen? His ties to
Stanford are likely too strong,
but a sizeable paycheck could
change that. And the thought
that he would need to rebuild a
program would likely deter him.
Butch Jones, head coach,
Tennessee:
Background: Jones isn't
having the most successful
year in Knoxville, where the
Volunteers are currently 6-6.
But he took over both Central
Michigan and Cincinnati from
Brian Kelly and built those
teams up even further. He holds
a 61-40 record in his eight years
as a head coach.
Pros and cons: Jones has
experience taking over
programs and can recruit well.
He's also a Michigan native and
has enough experience against
top teams in the SEC. But he's
not fared well enough at a big
program to prove he can handle
Michigan.
Could it happen? After two
years, Jones is likely to stay put
at Tennessee for now. But he's a
good balance of a big name and
comes from small beginnings.
If he is willing to move, then he
could be a good candidate.
Jim Harbaugh, Head coach
(NFL), San Francisco 49ers:
Background: The name
everyone has called
for, Jim Harbaugh, is a
former quarterback under
Schembechler and now working
in the NFL. He holds a 43-16-
1 record with the 49ers, but is
havinghisworst seasonwith the
team, currently sitting at 7-5. He
coached at Stanford before that,
taking over alowly program and
finishing with an 11-1 record
after the 2010 season.
Pros and cons: Harbaugh
developed a strong offense at
Stanford and knows how to
develop talent even better. He is
a proven winner in college and
in the NFL, known for his terse
demeanor. But Harbaugh is very
controlling and does not always
get along with his players.
Could it happen? No matter
how hard you wish, it's not likely.
He's rumored to be leaving San
Francisco, but ESPN's Adam
Schefter has said he's not likely
to return to Ann Arbor. But if
Hackett were able to swing the
deal, it could be the beginning of
a turnaround.
Other options: Michigan
will have plenty of options
beyond those mentioned above.
Here are some other options
that could be in the mix.
Greg Schiano, unemployed,
previously at the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and Rutgers.
Mike Gundy, head coach,
Oklahoma State.
Pat Narduzzi, defensive
coordinator, Michigan State.
Scott Frost, offensive
coordinator, Oregon.
Rich Rodriguez, head coach,
Arizona, 2014 Pac 12 Coach of
the Year (Just kidding. Wanted
to see if you were still reading).

Sophomore forward Zak Irvin scored 12 points on Tuesday, but his two three pointers helped swing momentum.
Jackson surprisedoke
fir ing, uncerta in on future,

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
Even amidst the speculation
surrounding Brady Hoke's job
status, running backs coach Fred
Jackson was still surprised by
Tuesday's announcement that
Hoke had been fired.
Jackson said he had heard of
Hoke's firing through the news,
and not from Hoke himself
on Tuesday afternoon outside
Schembechler Hall.
"I didn't really expect it,"
Jackson said upon arriving. "I
know we didn't play as well as
people would like to see us play,
but I also understand it's all
about winning and losing and we
didn't win enoughgames."
Monday, the Wolverines'
running backs coach for the
past 23 years had been on the
road recruiting for Hoke, talking

to recruits about next year's
situation and "how good (the
running backs) can be." But one
day later, he was left wondering
about his ownjob.
"I'm going to coach football
somewhere," he said. "It might
not be here."
And he could do it again, as
interim Athletic Director Jim
Hackett said assistant coaches
would be meeting about their
futures. It should be noted that
Jackson has survived several
head coach changes before,
includingRichRodriguez in2010.
He worked under Gary
Moeller and Lloyd Carr, coaching
backs such as Chris Perry, Mike
Hart and Anthony Thomas.
"One of the messages we're
going to give them is that we'd
like to have our new coach have
the right to interview them,"
Hackett said. "I don't want

them to have to go through two
disappointments."
And after going through
coaching changes, Hackett has
seen how each coach has left the
program. But he wasn't prepared
to say whether Hoke had a fair
shot to finish coaching.
"I don't know how to answer
that question," Jackson said. "I
feel the administration makes
decisions based on when they
need a timetable made but I'm
not 100-percentsurewhat'sright
orwronginthatsituation.
"It's a situation now where I
feel uncomfortable that these
kids are putin this position where
they're not knowing everything
was goingto happen so fast."

Jim Hackett: 'I want
to get rid of the word
Michigan Man'

4

1141

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSports Editor
Interim Athletic Director
Jim Hackett is a University
alum, played football under
Bo Schembechler and has had
connections to Michigan for
more than four decades.
But there's a popular phrase
Hackett doesn't like, and he's
hoping to eradicate it in the com-
ing months.
"I want to get rid of the word
'Michigan Man, " Hackett said
at his press conference Tuesday
afternoon, when he announced
the firing of Michigan football
coach Brady Hoke. "There's three
reasons:
"One is we live in a world
where no business or anything
we talk about has just men in it.
So that's first.
"Second, the guy who said
that, Bo Schembechler - one of
my mentors and heroes - was
being challenged about a coach

being recruited somewhere else,
and he meant he wanted the per-
son at Michigan to be the coach.
"Thethirdthing,though, ifyou
let it stand for what it's supposed
to mean, here's what it means: If
you cut open the soul of the peo-
ple that are 'Michigan Men,' so to
speak, you find first selflessness.
This was a point about how we
stand for the team first.
"The second tyhing is the
ability to win, be competitive.
The competitive spirit in my
lifetime and with others that you
see around here that played, we
knew that we had to work really
hard. It wasn't arrogance; it was
about being competitive.
"The third thing is we want to
continue the legacy of what has
been great from a value stand-
point. This place does not need to
cut corners to win. You've got alot
of pride in the fact that you come
here; you know you're signing up
to be the best in the world without
any shenanigans going on."

RACE
From Page 5B

Each team's score
is the sum of the
finishing places of
its first five runners
and the lowest score
wins. A team's sixth
and seventh finish-
ers work as support
or tiebreakers.
In the NCAA
Championships
for the women's
cross country team,
the women's team
placed 18th, with
their runners com-
ing in at 68, 82, 95,
104 and 125 - total-
ing to 424 points.
Michigan State Uni-
versity's women's
cross country team
won with 85 points.
Because of the
importance of
placement - which
oftentimes is so
close that a few sec-
onds in a race could
mean a 30 point dif-
ference - coaches,
including Manett's,
encourage athletes
to run in packs.
McGuire said
this as he watched
five of the nine,
championship team
girls run circles
around the track on
a brisk November
afternoon several
days after the Big
Ten Champion-
ships. These top
runners were doing
their first track
workout after the
Big Ten meet, and it
was a hard one. Sep-
arated into different
segments, they ran
at "tempo" pace -
moderately difficult
pace - for 10 min-
utes, six minutes,
four minutes and
another four minutes, with a minute break
between each set. The tempo was progres-
sive: each set had to be faster than the first.
"It's to see if you can eat an elephant one
bite at a time," McGuire said, preparing his
stopwatch.
The track was busy that day, but with the
sun shining directly on it, the ambiance was
calm.
The five girls were separated into packs
of two and three depending on their speed.

Manett, one of the two in the faster pack,
is typically the third fastest runner on the
team. In the final meets of the season, how-
ever, Manett ranked sixth or seventh on the
team. Despite this, McGuire urged her to
keep pushing. Their intensity and determi-
nation on the track was palpable.
The sun settled as the runners picked up
their pace, looping the track.
"Just go; don't care anymore," McGuire
yelled as they ran by. Manett was trailing
behind the pack. "Just go."
For Manett, the pack mentality is crucial.
Even while running in practice, the team
works off of each other; having another per-
son to run with is not only motivating, but
also gives each runner a person to talk to.
Even Manett, enthralled in this hyper-com-
petitive sport, finds practice to be relaxing
and a social time to talk to her friends.
As the team circled, Manett exchanged
brief back-and-forths with her teammate
Kinesiology senior Megan Weschler: "Keep
going," or "Push." Though Manett trailed
behind Weschler every few laps, she pushed
harder while McGuire yelled, "Stay with the
pack" as they curved around the track for
the last time.
Manett said her commitment to run-
ning - and to her team - does not add to
her stress. With a busy academic schedule
as Neuroscience major, Manett depends on
her teammates for help. After all, they all are
going through the same stress as they work
to reach the same goal.
"Having teammates help you means you
can shoulder that weight together - the
expectations and pressure of what you have
to do as a team," she said.
For Ornelas, running serves the same
purpose. Even though he is no longer on a
formal team, he tries his best to ensure that
he can have a running partner each day. It
keeps him motivated.
"At any level, someone to run with keeps
you in check," he said. "If it's just you, you
can make up excuses for yourself. Running
should be a social thing."
Other runners agree. Why would over
200 students sign up for MRun, the Univer-
sity's running club? Presumably, they want
to run with someone else. Runners need
these partners not only to have someone to
talk to on those lonely 20 mile training runs,
but also to push them when necessary.
Keeping fellow runners close is part of
the dynamic of the sport as well. With bare-
ly any fan base, the women's cross country
team depends on each other for support,
Manett said.
Soon, running no longer becomes an obli-
gation or task for the day, but a necessary
time for both self-determination and self-
reflection. And this feeling may be only rele-
vant for runners who understand the mental
effects of the sport. With so much emotion
involved, it's difficult to see why the fans
don't show up.

a championship remained elusive as LSA
junior Shannon Osika, another top runner,
joined Finn with an injury.
After NCAA Championships on Nov. 23,
Michigan coach Mike McGuire recognized
the injuries, noting he would've hoped for
a healthier season for his student-athletes.
However, he said the team still pushed
through.
"I think that the seven that were out there
showed a lot of resiliency," McGuire said.

"We could've folded our cards and finished
25th or 26th."
In varsity college cross country races,
men and women run 8Ks and 6Ks, respec-
tively, with seven athletes in for each team.
These seven runners score points for their
team based on his or her finishing place.
This means if the first runner for the team
finishes fifth, he or she scores five points and
that number will be added to the total score
of the team.

Wednesday, December 3, 2014 The Statement 7B
Personal Statement: Cool like 'Kill Bill'
by Alec Stern

from the pews: born to believe?

-BY CLAIRE BRYAN
Looking around the oak din-
ing room table at every holi-
day family dinner, you'll
find one empty seat as we all grab
hands, tilt heads and listen to. my
Uncle Steve recite a prayer.
My Grandfather Albert - a
man who refused to surrender to
the nickname of Grandpa or Pops
- would be in the kitchen pacing.
You'd find him snacking on parts
of the turkey, muttering under his
breath and refusing to listen or
take part in any prayer.
Albert grew up in Kosice, Slo-
vakia in the confines of a strict
Catholic family. He was taught
that the Holy Spirit guided his
life, that a child would go to hell if
not baptized and that he must only'
marry a woman who was Catholic.
He had little in the way of expo-
sure to other brands of Christi-
anity, and yet, from an unusually
early age, he rejected this faith
entirely. My Grandfather Albert is
an atheist.
He rejected religious doctrine
as unnatural, as if science created
him this way, as if he were born
totally unable to believe in any
form of faith. Despite his culture,
background, family and environ-
ment - all factors influencing
one's spirituality - Albert could
not attach any part of his life to
ideas he viewed as "whimsical."

of us is born with a unique gene
sequence, Albert's might have had
a variation that changed his abil-
ity to become someone his family
believed he should have been.
Some may argue Albert's indi-
viduality was linked to how his
family presented Catholicism to
him. Too strict, too oppressive,
too defined, so that it caused him
to reject it and accept the oppo-
site - a spirituality free lifestyle.
Or, if you find Hamer and Clon-
inger's line of thinking attractive,
Albert, and every one of us, is born
on a spectrum of susceptibility to
accepting a religion, taught to us
or not.
Religion is complicated. And
that complexity is intensified
when religious beliefs commingle
with scientific findings. But as
I grapple with the truth behind
what religion to grasp or reject in
life, I pause and linger over Hamer
and Cloninger's claim. I can be at
peace while contemplating that
the concept of "being religious"
may not be in my control entirely.
It may be the biological science of
my body and beyond some of my.
own means. '

have always made decisions
based on what other people
will think. I know it's wrong,
and outwardly I'm not self-con-
scious or paranoid. But it's always
been there. That tick. That nag-
ging voice in my head. An inces-
sant impulse to be something I
assume other people want me to
be.
To be like everybody else. To be
normal. To be cool..
I can appreciate it now, but
growing up I always felt differ-
ent. Not quite an outcast, but just
deeply different from everyone
else around me. My mom would
tell me it was a good thing - that
I was her artistic son; the creative
one. But if there was one thing
I knew to be true, it was that
10-year-old boys don't want to
be "creative." At least, I certainly
didn't. I wished I had that aggres-
sive streak like most other boys
in my class. A part of me wished
I cared about which team won the
Yankees game the night before
but above all, I wished nobody
would care that I didn't care at
all. But that's the measure of boy-
hood. So as not to disappoint my
peers (read: subject myself to the
ridicule T thought I'd become the
target of), I just blended in.,
Let me be very clear, I hated
sports - it was the amalgama-

tion of everything that didn't
come easy to me. I didn't have the
natural ability to throw a spiral
like my brother. I couldn't run
as far or as fast as my friends. I
certainly didn't enjoy it as much
as my classmates. To me, "cre-
ative" might as well have been a
synonym for "uncoordinated."
My relationship with organized
sports is even more haunting. In
my mind, it was a series of never-
ending practices, impossible exer-
cises and embarrassing tantrums.
In Little League, upon finally
attaining the coveted "pitcher's
helper" position, I was swiftly
replaced; in the car ride home I
told my parents it was because "I
sucked." In roller hockey, I was
relegated to the bench on a team
my own family member was the
coach of. In high school, I closely
monitored the number of kids
trying out for the lacrosse team
because I knew if there were cuts,
I wouldn't make it.
The worst part of all this is that
I could have stopped at any time.
Everyday I told myself to just give
up. I could have forgotten about
everything and done exactly what
I wanted to do; it's my life, after
all. But it was easier said than
done. Instead, in my unfailing
desire to be like any other kid -
to not stick out in the crowd - I

forced myself to keep trying, just
rotating between sports until
maybe something stuck. Nothing
ever did.
But away from school, when
the voices of everyone else in my
head subsided and I would finally
hear my own, I could just be me;
the artistic son my mom seemed
to appreciate so much. Unbe-
knownst to anybody at school,
I took acting classes. I painted.
I saved up money to buy a video
camera and taught myself how to
edit my own clips together. And
in 2004, at the very ripe age of
10 years old, I saw a movie that
totally changed my perception of
myself.
I was instantly enamored with
"Kill Bill" - an almost cartoon-
ishly-quick, magnetically power-
ful attraction, as if every movie
I had seen up to that point no
longer mattered, and any movie
I would see in the future would
undoubtedly pale in comparison.
It was stylistic. It was interesting.
It was uniquely itself and wholly
unapologetic. "Kill Bill" was the
first time movies were cool; not
traditional or acclaimed or widely
popular, but just cool in a way I
never thought any expression of
creativity could be. And I latched
onto it.
The movie became my iden-

tity; it was my thing, my signi-
fier. I thought the more I engaged
with it, the more "Kill Bill" 's cool
would rub off on me, and I would
be cool in the way I wanted to be
- not just in the way I thought I
needed to be. As the years went
on, it was easier to embrace the
different sides-of myself because
of how "Kill Bill" became a part of
who I was. I wasn't embarrassed
by it in the way I was embarrassed
about other artistic things. I was
embarrassed to take acting class-
es. I was embarrassed that I would
rather film a lacrosse game than
actually play in one. But "Kill Bill"
was different. I might not be able
to explain it, but for the first time
in my life I felt better about being
me. It didn't matter if I were at
school or at home or at a practice
for whichever sport-of-the-sea-
son I chose. Because of "Kill Bill,"
I knew I could grow up and grow
into myself in a way that would
ease all of the harsh feelings I had
harbored over the years. One day,
I would make something as cool as
"Kill Bill" - something that was
mine, and I'd no longer struggle
with uncertainty over my identity
or dependency on someone else's.
When I came to Michigan four
years ago, that conquest for tra-
ditional normalcy didn't subside.
If anything, it was almost like

it started all over again - new
friends to make, new people to
win over and new opportunities
to use as a disguise. But that's not
how I look at it now, three years
later. With each year, I no longer
see my college experience as a
new chance to fail, but rather as
a new opportunity to introduce
myself, truthfully. Each year, I
get better at being me, and most
importantly, I rely less and less on
fiction to do so.
Now I'm at a turning point; it's
the first true crossroads in my life,
and I can see both paths ahead of
me. It's fitting - poetic, even -
that Michigan is right in the mid-
dle of where I've been and where
I want to go. One road leads back
home. East. My family is there.
My friends are there. I could go
back to living my life as if it's a
reflection of everyone else.
The other road is more daunt-
ing. I would be in a place I've never
been before. I would be totally on
my own. I would finally be forced
to think only about myself. What
do I want? Who do I want tobe?
I know I have no choice but to
go West, otherwise all of this -
my childhood, my struggles, my
growth - would have been for
nothing. I owe it to myself, and
I'm terrified. But at least now I
know that I'm doing it for me.

butt really
BY MARIAM SHEIKH

'UWecome to Michigan.
A maize banner hung next to
the entrance of the Central Cam-
pus Recreation Building for the final week of
August with these words written in blue let-
ters - a small act designed to help returning
and incoming students feel welcomed in one of
the school's most-visited buildings.
But once inside, welcoming probably isn't
the right word to convey the building's atmo-
sphere. On the first floor, dozens of students
can be found waiting in line for pick-up games
of basketball and volleyball, while above them
two friends cut their run short due to the
uneven track.
Further down the hall, patrons are disap-
pointed to learn of the pool's early closure
because there is a shortage of lifeguards.
Downstairs, the weight room features 64
men, zero women and one window.
Welcome to Michigan.
Every day, the recreational sports depart-
ment at the University does what they can
to address crowds, outdated equipment and
comfortable environments, but sometimes the
facts pile up just a little too high.
It's a fact that when the CCRB was built
in 1977, enrollment was 26,673. Today it sits
at 43,625 - a 63.5-percent increase - but the
University's primary fitness facility has yet to
undergo any expansionary construction.
It's a fact that the average age of equip-
ment at the CCRB is cited by its directors as
nine years old and features a track and pool
that haven't been updated in more than two
decades.
The University - one of the founding
fathers of intramural and recreational sports
- has fallen behind other schools, small and
large, in the quality of its fitness facilities, and
must raise the bar in order to keep up.
Welcome to Michigan.
As a freshman, you were undoubtedly told
of what recreational sports had to offer. With
three major fitness centers, all equipped with
weights, gymnasiums, cardio equipment and
pools, there's plenty of great options to exer-
cise year-round for no additional charge.
Engineering freshman Melinda Kothbauer
remembers how excited she was when she
heard about the opportunities that would be
before her when she finally made it to campus.
"It's easy to forget how nice it is to have mul-
tiple gyms within walking distance that don't
cost anything extra," Kothbauer said. "Other
schools do it too I guess, but it's still really
nice."'
Kothbauer said she has enjoyed the CCRBin
her first semester, so much so that she bought
a U-Move season pass, giving her access to a
variety of fitness classes. But her appreciation
- didn't come without some early lessons.
"I remember walking into the weight room,

and just seeing all these huge guys around,"
Kothbauer said. "It was really intimidating,
especially since I'm not a weightlifter or any-
thing.
"It's kind of like that everywhere (in the
building). You can tell the majority of the peo-
ple who use the CCRB work out all the time,
so you definitely feel self-conscious and avoid
peak hours if that isn't you."
Kothbauer said she grew accustomed to the
CCRB, but her past experiences with gyms left
the CCRB with more to be desired.
"They sound like really small things, but
I've worked out at gyms in the past that had
windows, high ceilings, natural lighting, plac-
es to set your stuff and just more space," Koth-
bauer said. "Itall seems small, but it adds up to
the overall experience."
She's not alone. When the CCRB opened in
1977, Rocky Balboa had just started downing
raw eggs and punching meat carcasses in gray
sweatsuits, giving fitness a very distinct brand.
To say working out has changed since then is
an understatement.
Mike Widen, the director of Recreational
Sports at the University, is well aware of these
expanded boundaries. Since arriving to Ann
Arbor from the University of Iowa last Sep-
tember, Widen has pushed for major overhauls
in all three facilities. The initiative could be
realized thanks to a $65 per-student fee enact-
ed last year, and has already broughtforth new
turf and lightingsystems at Mitchell Field.
As of right now, the Intramural Sports
Building will begin renovations in May, the
North Campus Recreation Building will
begin in 2016 and - provided the Kinesiology
research facilities and classrooms currently
located throughout can be vacated to new
buildings - the CCRB will begin construction
in 2020.
The reasons for these renovations, Widen
said, are obvious.
Recreation has changed a lotsince the facil-
ities were built in 1928 and 1976. Wilden said
today, there is more group exercising, cardio
and need for multipurpose rooms. The Univer-
sity's facilities, he said, simply don't match up.
"Our students deserve to have modern
and enjoyable exercise opportunities as part
of their experience here on campus," he said.
"We hadn't really invested alot in the past few
decades in that idea. Now we have the oppor-
tunity to get our facilities upgraded so they're
worthy of the Michigan brand and the Michi-
gan standard."
Rec Sport's struggle to keep up with stu-
dents' interests is especially surprising given
the University's storied history of recreational
sports.
In 1913, the University was first in the
nation to create a formal department for recre-
ation on a college campus. Fifteen years later, it

built the IMSB, the first dedicated intramural
facility in the country. Then-Athletic Direc-
tor Fielding Yost stressed the importance of
access to athletics for all, using the mantra
"sound mind, sound body."
The mantra isn't located on any mission
statements today, but still rings true in the
offices of recreational sports. Constant efforts
are made bythe departmentto engage, encour-
age and build excitement around fitness, exer-
cise and wellness in the student body.
"We're changing," Widen said. "We're add-
ing new programs. The programsthat we have
are very popular, more than ever here at Mich-
igan, so there's a lot of good energy going on.
But that means the bar's being raised by our
students."
In 2014, many feel that the bar simply isn't
being met.
In many senses of the word, the University's
Recreational Sports is out of shape. While nine
Big Ten schools made Men's Fitness' most
recent "Top 25 fittest colleges" list (includ-
ing Michigan State University ranked at third
and The Ohio State University ranked first),
the University hasn't made the cut in the four
years that data has been collected.
A look at Ohio State's facilities provides a
glimpse into what the University can be. The
campus features five fitness buildings within
the confines of campus, with its central loca-
tion amassing more than 500,000 square feet
(compared to the CCRB's 145,000) and has
been cited by numerous publications as one of
the nation's best.
All facilities feature lounges and leisure
activities to help students relax and de-stress
while improving their physical health. Addi-
tionally, Ohio State has dedicated itself to pro-
viding for its students - from free fitness tests
to an open forum for voicing comments about
the facilities.
This all came tobe in recentyears not from
long battles with the University's Board of
Regents or tuition increases like Wilden and
his department are facing, but from dozens of
donors and sponsors who saw the benefits of
sound mind, sound body.
"Right now, a lot of the newer recreation
buildings in the Big Ten and across the coun-
try have formed into this social opportunity
on campus," Widen said. "It's not just a place to
work out anymore. Looking at our three facili-
ties, we don't really have that. We have a few
couches, but that's not very welcoming.
"We want health and wellness and fitness to
be a part of students' lives, so we need our cen-
ters to be comfortable, welcoming and a place
where people want to go, not just a destination
people only go to for working out."
The spectacle down in Columbus is still
largely a pipe dream for University students.
New facilities are two years away, and the ren-

ovations of the NCRB and CCRBhave yet to be
officially designed, budgeted or approved.
University students likely won't make the
four-hour commute to Columbus to work
out anytime soon, but does Michigan need to
worry about competition? According to Koth-
bauer, they should.
"I've definitely considered other gyms and
would consider other ones too," Kothbauer
said. "I don't have a car, so the CCRB is still
my best option, but a lot of these gyms are just
nicer to work out in."
Transportation has prevented Kothbauer
from going elsewhere, but some have made the
switch.
The Och Fitness Center, located in the base-
ment of the Ross School of Business, offers
memberships to students, limited guests, fac-
ulty and staff of Michigan's business and law
schools for $30 a month. It's not for everyone,
but Och sees plenty of business from students
despite the fee.
"Alotofmyfriendsuseittoo, it'sprettycom-
mon as far as I can tell," said Business junior .
Ian Forman, who's had a membership since he
was a pre-admit. "Part of it is for convenience
since your classes are in the same building, but
it's also really nice and well taken care of. In
my experience it's well worth the money."
Widen said he hates to see his facilities not
providing for its students, but he also can't
blame them for leaving.
"A lot of what causes that is facilities and
equipment," Widen said. "We have not kept
our equipment up to the national standard or
even to the area standard. The way things are
now if you want the top-of-the-line treadmills
you have to go somewhere else."
The CCRB is still nearly six years away
from renovations, but efforts are being made
to keep up now. New equipment will arrive to
the CCRB in the winter semester, extended
hours and social media presence are hoping
to engage students to work out and new group
exercise classes have begun this fall. It's no
cure-all, but their hope is the little things and
dedication can eventually save the day.
"If you look at recreational sports across
the country, we may have been the last school
to start a group exercise program, which you
never want to say when you're at Michigan,"
Widen said. "But we wanted to give students
that experience and we're continuing to try
things out and catch up."
Other options are sprouting up, and the
students Rec Sports have spent nearly a cen-
tury catering to are slowly walking away. The
migration is slow for now, but can the CCRB
keep up?
"The bar's been raised," Widen said. "We
can't justsit back and let things be what they've
always been. We've got to do our part to meet
that bar and those raised expectations."

THE THOUGHT BUBBLE

Kim Kardashian's #Break-
theinternet campaign is just
e latest evidence of soci-
ety's serious obsession with bigbutts.
I mean, don't act like you haven't
noticed. It's funny to think that just a
few years
ago, size
00 was
what
was con-
sidered
beau-
tiful,
healthy
and
desir-
able.
And here
we are
now, in
2014, and
the idea ILLUSTRAT1O
of a full-
er female body is back. Think about
it, there are TV shows like "The
Mindy Project" and "Fargo" featur-
ing leading ladies like Mindy Kaling
and Allison Tolman who embody the
idea of a real woman in more ways
than one. Singer Meghan Trainor is
trying to bring "booty back" with her
song, "All About That Bass.' Today,
across runways "plus-size" models
are making a statement, not to men-
tion brands like Dove are featuring
real women in their commercials
and marketing campaigns. So, all in
all, it would appear that society is
heading in the right direction, right?
But is it really? Big boobs, big

butt, tiny waist - it's not exactly the
easiest body type to obtain. It doesn't
matter how many X-rays Mrs. West
sits on, there is no way her butt
is real, and I'm calling bullshit on
the champagne glass balancing
act she had
going on in
Paper. Nicki
Minaj, Iggy
Azalea - it
seems like a
mandate for
every "real"
and "hot"
woman is
to have an
extra 20 lbs
of fat on their
back-ends.
JLo, I under-
stand -that
N BY MAGGIt MIUEttyou are the
original
Jenny from the block, but you are
42 years old and the "Booty" action
you had going on in your latest video
was unnecessary.
So why the obsession all of the
sudden? Society is holding women
up to artificial and unfair standards.
Be a size 0 if you want, be a size 12 if
you want,but don't for asecond think
the "correct" way to look includes a
butt the size of a Thanksgiving tur-
key. Ah, 2014, a year of such prog-
ress - the iPhone 6, a baby Gosling,
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt finally
married - but also such regression,
the year of the butt, the overwhelm-
ing obsession with a woman's ass.

SA junior Taylor Manett isn't 300
pounds of muscle or covered in
tattoos. She doesn't talk trash or
throw punches on the field. She doesn't
have 25,000 Twitter followers like former
Michigan offensive tackle Taylor Lewan.
But she has one thing that all big-time ath-
letes need: the drive to succeed. Motivated
athletically, academically and mentally, she
competes on the national scale with the
Michigan women's cross country team.
Between traveling each weekend to dif-
ferent meets - this season, they competed
in Boston, Indiana and Iowa, among other
places - she majors in Neuroscience and
hopes to go to medical school. But accord-
ing to Manett, her ability to balance a rig-
orous academic schedule with running
competitively is natural for most runners.
"It's definitely hard," she said "Youhave
to manage your time very well."
Before racing during championship
season in November, Manett had goals of
earning All Big Ten, All-Regionals and All
American titles - that's top 14, 25 and 40
in each race, respectively. Though Manett
did not achieve this feat, it's hard to believe

Just after crossing the marathon finish line,
Detroit resident Randall Brown immedi-
ately melted into tears. Catching hisbreath,
Brown said he chose to run the marathon in
honor of his close friend who passed away
earlier this year.
While Brown didn't consider himself a
competitive runner before training for the
Detroit Marathon, his finish time rang in
at 3:27:29 - significantly lower than the
4:16:00 average finish time for men across
all 2013 marathons.
But for Brown, the marathon was not
about the finishing time; it was about hon-
oring his friend.
"It's worth it," he said as his friends and
family surrounded him minutes after he
finished. Though his hands were pressed
against his knees leaning forward and tears
were flowing down his cheeks, his smile
overcame any other emotion he felt. The
