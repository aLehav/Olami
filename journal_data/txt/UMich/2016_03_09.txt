Clinton falls to 
Vermont senator 
after projected 20- 

point win

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.) 

won 
Michigan’s 
Democratic 

presidential primary with 50.1 
percent of the vote Tuesday night 
after an unexpected surge of vot-

ing in the state broke records and 
pushed him over the edge.

Sanders’ rival in the Demo-

cratic contest, Hillary Clinton 
earned 48 percent of the vote. 
Sanders’ victory comes as a sur-
prise, as previous polls suggested 
a decisive victory for Clinton 
with a RealClearPolitics polling 
average showing her leading by 
a 21.4 point margin. This is the 
biggest upset since the 1984 New 
Hampshire primary when Wal-
ter Mondale, who was favored to 
win by 17.1 percent, lost to Gary 
Hart.

Because Michigan’s delegates 

are 
allocated 
proportionally, 

Sanders is slated to gain 77 of the 
state’s 130 delegates from his vic-
tory, with the other 53 going to 
Clinton. 

The senator did particularly 

well in cities like Ann Arbor 
where there is a large popula-
tion of young, white liberals, 
and where turnout was unusu-
ally huge. At the University of 
Michigan, students appeared to 
be leaning toward Sanders based 
on student interviews outside of

DDA plans to create 
heated indoor space 

using $175,000 

grant

By LYDIA BARRY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor Downtown 

Development 
Authority 
has 

granted $175,000 for the Ann 
Arbor Farmers Market Infra-
structure Improvement Project.

The funding, announced Feb. 

26, is slated to be used to con-
struct an improved, partially 
indoor market space that can 
operate year-round, particular-
ly to extend the market’s open 
hours in the winter months. 
Currently, the market operates 
Saturdays in the winter months 
and Wednesdays and Saturdays 
May through December. 

The project, which is yet to be 

approved by the Ann Arbor City 
Council, proposes a new roofed 
structure that features large

CAPS Director 
Todd Sevig also 

addresses body on 
resource allocation

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

Central Student Government pro-
posed an amendment to the Board 
of Regents bylaws to reintroduce a 
section pertaining to student voice 
at their meeting Tuesday.

The body also heard from Todd 

Sevig, director of Counseling and 
Psychological Services.

In his executive communica-

tions to the body, CSG President 
Cooper Charlton, LSA senior, 
addressed the previously existing 
Section VII of the regent’s bylaws, 
which discussed student affairs 
and the incorporation of student 
opinions in University affairs.

“In 2011 the Regent bylaws 

were ‘cleaned-up,’ so-to-speak,” 
he said. “Section VII was removed, 
which indicates the importance 

of student voice in the process of 
decision making in the University. 
We want to reinstitute (Section 
VII) and make sure that there is a 
healthy relationship. Let’s codify 
and show how important it is for 
students to have a voice in the 
decision-making process.”

Public Policy sophomore Jacob 

Pearlman, CSG student legal coun-
sel, wrote in an e-mail interview 
that CSG was working with sever-
al executive officers to re-add the 
language.

“CSG is working closely with 

Vice Presidents Churchill and 
Harper to add language to the cur-
rently nonexistent Chapter VII,” 
Pearlman wrote. “This language 
will reaffirm the University’s com-
mitment to ensure that students 
are in an environment to thrive as 
Leaders and Best.”

Pearlman added that CSG is 

currently collaborating to put 
together the proposed language, 
and aim to have it adopted in the 
next few months. Changing the 
Regents’ bylaws requires a vote of 
the Regents at one of their regu-
larly scheduled meetings.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Donald Trump speaks to supporters at a pre-caucus rally in Cedar Rapids, IA on February 1, 2016.

Trump wins 

Michigan by over 
10 percent, with 

close race for second

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Frontrunner Donald Trump 

won the Michigan Republican pri-
mary Tuesday night with 37.7 per-
cent of the Republican vote.

Michigan’s demographics are 

fairly representative of the U.S. 
population as a whole in terms of 
minority population proportion, 
median income and age distribu-
tion, according to U.S. census data. 
though those demographics don’t 
necessarily correspond with the 
electorate.

Trump was followed by Gov. 

John Kasich (R–Ohio) who won 
25.9 percent. Gov. Ted Cruz (R–
Tex.) — who nationally follows 
Trump by 15.2 percent according to 
a RealClearPolitics polling average 
— came in third with 22.5 percent 
of the vote, and Sen. Marco Rubio 

(R–Fla.) finished fourth earning 
only 9 percent of the vote, with 25.5 
percent of precincts reporting.

Washtenaw County was one 

of two counties in the state with 
a majority vote for Kasich, along 
with Kalamazoo County. 

Trump continues to lead the 

delegate counts at 384 delegates 
with Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Tex.) in 
second with 300 and Sen. Marco 
Rubio (R–Fla.) trailing in a distant 
third with 151 delegates. A total of 
1,237 delegates are needed to win 
the Republican nomination.

At the polls, ‘U’ students cite 
college policies as top priority

Sanders seems 
favorite among 
campus voters in 
Tuesday’s primary

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Across the entire state, the 

economy and jobs, government 
spending, 
terrorism 
and 

immigration 
were 
the 
issues 

Michigan residents cared most 
about, according to CNN exit 
polls. However, for students at the 
University of Michigan college 
affordability, women’s rights and 
the performance of the economy 
and job availability were their top 
issues, according to interviews 
conducted by Michigan Daily 
reporters during the day.

Though 
they 
didn’t 
align 

completely with residents overall, 
those issues — and those students 
— may have had a significant 
impact on at least the Democratic 
primary outcome, which saw 
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) 
winning an upset victory over 
Hillary Clinton amid large turnout 
from college areas. In the lead-
up to Tuesday’s primary, Clinton 
was projected to win by over a 20 
percent margin.

In the Republican primary, 

frontrunner Donald Trump won 
the state with about 36 percent of 
the total vote.

Throughout 
Ann 
Arbor 

Tuesday, it was easy to find various 
people and groups walking around 
campus, telling people to vote and 
make their voices heard. At the 
Michigan League, a main polling 
spot for students, a total of 646 
voters according to poll volunteers. 
The Michigan Union, another big 
polling spot, saw 711 voters as of 
7:30 p.m., a half-hour before the 
polls closed, which the polling 
clerk said was the biggest voter 
turnout at the Union since the 
2008 election.

Many 
students 
said 
they 

realized their priorities, especially 
the high emphasis placed on 

college affordability, would be 
different than statewide priorities 
due to their proximity to the issue.

LSA sophomore Yong-Joon Kim 

said a candidate’s platform for 
student debt played a large part in 
who he decided to vote for.

“Since I am a college student, 

one of the top things I was 
thinking about was college tuition. 
In my opinion, Bernie definitely 
promised a lot of things — he was 
promising college students that 
he would be reducing tuition and 
making college free,” Kim said. 
“But a lot of the cases I feel that 
Bernie’s ideas and his math just 
doesn’t add up, in my opinion.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Kolenda, president of Students for 
Sanders, said he thinks Bernie’s 
attention to college affordability 
allowed him to perform well in 
Monday’s primary. Of the students 
the Daily talked to at various 
campus voting sites, the majority 
said they were voting for Sanders.

“It’s daunting that Clinton has 

her current delegate lead, but it’s 
not surprising as the first 15 or 
so states have been a plurality to 
majority Southern,” Kolenda said. 
“This is where Clinton naturally 
performs best as. [Her] campaign 
likely still has its best days ahead 
of it — many states in the Rockies, 
Pacific Northwest and parts of 
New England are heavily favorable 
towards him.”

Other than student debt, other 

issue students cited were social 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
women’s 

rights.

LSA junior Kendra Mantz said 

she sees Sanders as a candidate 
who respects women.

“Women’s rights is a huge thing 

for me. I consider myself a strong 
feminist and so having my own 
rights, such as my reproductive 
rights, being taken away from me 
or monitored by old, white men 
in the government, that doesn’t 
fly with me,” Mantz said. “I don’t 
like that. I appreciate that Bernie 
respects a woman’s right to control 
her own body”

In terms of women’s rights, 

LSA sophomore Anushka Sarkar, 
outreach 
director 
and 
event 

coordinator 
for 
Students 
for 

Hillary, noted that in terms of 
women’s rights, Clinton is the 
only 
candidate 
to 
frequently 

address safety for women on 
college campuses and halting the 
rise of sexual assault. The issue is 
a particularly prevalent one for 
the University, which is currently 
restructuring its sexual assault 
policy. She said she thought that 
emphasis 
contributed 
to 
the 

Clinton’s campaign overall lead in 
the race.

“I think we are getting to the 

point where, mathematically, it’s 
impossible for Sanders to win 
unless he gets every state by a 50 
point margin,” Sarkar said. “I think 
the general direction her campaign 
is taking is less about villainizing 
other campaigns and more about 
why she is the best candidate.”

Other 
students 
said 
they 

placed a heavy importance on the 
performance of the economy, as 
many are graduating soon and 
need to find jobs — such as LSA 
senior Sunder Kannan

“The main issues that I’m 

considering are economic issues 
as they relate to unemployment 
among recent graduates,” Kannan 
said. “I’m graduating in May and 
so it does worry me about finding 
a job and paying for grad school.”

Despite the overwhelmingly 

Democratic voters, there were 
also individuals voting Republican 
at the polling stations Tuesday, 
though for varying reasons.

Business senior Jeff Yu said he 

voted on the Republican ballot 
despite identifying himself as 
a Democrat. Michigan election 
law allows voters to participate 
in either party’s primary without 
being registered to a specific party 
beforehand.

“I’m actually a Democrat, but 

because it’s an open primary, I am 
voting Republican just because 
I’m confident in both Democratic 
candidates,” Yu said. “And with the 
Republican party, I think there’s 
a better chance of swinging some 
delegates away from Trump.”

“

ally, it has been Ross students 
who have been participating, 
but our goal is to be campus-
wide, because there is so much 
opportunity for women to col-
laborate and find partners and 
just supporters.”

Kerppola said these sup-

porters 
could 
be 
fellow 

students across various dis-
ciplines as well as members 
within the broad community 
such 
as 
professionals 
and 

investors. She said she chose 
to screen this specific film 
after meeting one of the film’s 
producers at TEDWomen last 
spring and immediately con-
necting the project to her 
organization’s mission.

“Their vision was to address 

this huge gender gap that we 
see in tech and computer sci-
ence,” she said. “She told me a 
little about the documentary, 
and it was spot on, because 
one of the things we aim to do 
is encourage women to engage 
in entrepreneurship through 
whatever venue that is. Tech-

nology, computer science, pro-
gramming is certainly one of 
them.”

The Center for Entrepre-

neurship also sponsored the 
event. Ashleigh Bell, who runs 
student services in the office, 
said their mission of promot-
ing women and minorities tied 
in well to the event.

“Our office is very pas-

sionate about equality in the 
workplace and in the entre-
preneurial 
space, 
whether 

that be for women or under-
represented minorities,” she 
said. “This year we’re mak-
ing a really concerted effort 
to increase our enrollment of 
women in underrepresented 
minorities.”

Bell said in the past year the 

female enrollment of classes 
through the University of 
Michigan’s Center for Entre-
preneurship has increased by 
30 percent, which she added is 
only the beginning of increas-
ing engagement.

“I have conversations with 

female students all the time 
about being one of the only 
women in their classes and 
just really feeling that there 

is a non-inclusive culture,” 
Bell said. “(We) want to really 
help by having conversations 
about this issue and really 
empowering both women and 
everyone to engage in entre-
preneurship.”

The film, directed by Robin 

Hauser Reynolds, was inspired 
by the director’s daughter — a 
computer science major who 
found it frustrating to be one 
of two women in her class. It 
looks at why women are often 
discouraged from pursuing 
careers in technological fields 
and the sexism that occurs in 
these fields, but also the ben-
efits of having a more diverse 
workplace.

The film notes that comput-

er science is often not encour-
aged for female students or, 
in many states, even taught 
prior to the university level. 
It argues that once female stu-
dents — who have been cultur-
ally pushed away from fields 
like building and technology, 
and often see these paths as 
male-dominated 
fields 
— 

enter higher education, com-
puter science is not on their 
radars.

At the end of the film, Dan-

nan Hodge, vice president of 
Women Who Launch, led a 
brief group discussion dur-
ing which attendees shared 
thoughts about the film and 
their personal experiences 
in connection with it.

For Engineering freshman 

Monika Paliwoda, the film 
resonated with her experi-
ence in a coding class. She 
said though it was a beginner 
course, she was intimidated 
by the skills of her peers.

“It’s been really interest-

ing seeing that disparity 
and my confidence level has 
been tested a lot,” Paliwoda 
said. “I thought this movie 
was really interesting just 
to shed light on that it’s OK 
not to be one hundred per-
cent confident in your abili-
ties, and that doesn’t mean 
you’re a bad coder or a good 
coder. It just means that your 
level at that point in time is 
different, and that it’s some-
thing that you can learn in 
the future.”

Study measures 
county knowledge 
of health laws

According to a 2015 study 

by the Michigan Organization 
on Adolescent Sexual Health, 
Michigan’s 83 counties are better 
informed about reproductive 
health laws than they were five 
years ago. These laws were set by 
the Parental Rights Restoration 
Act of 1990. The study was 
funded by the National Institutes 
for Reproductive Health and 
done in partnership with the 
University.

The study was adapted from 

University of Michigan-led 
research in 2010, where students 
made phone calls to all Michigan 
counties, to simulate what a 
minor would go through as 
she sought information about 
reproductive health laws. 

In 2010, 54 percent of 

counties failed. In 2015, the 
statistic improved considerably: 
Approximately 26 percent of 
counties failed. Nonetheless, 
there remains room for 
improvement, according to a 
University press release. One 
problem that persists is judicial 
offices’ readiness to provide 
information on abortion rights 
law.

primary

The Detroit Free Press reports 

that Michigan could have 
registered a record turnout in 
Tuesday’s presidential primary, 
based on the high number of 
absentee ballots issued. Almost 
556,000 absentee ballots were 
issued as of earlier Tuesday, 
compared to 162,000 more than 
4 years ago. 

Christopher Thomas, director 

of elections for the Michigan 
Secretary of State reported 
that the SOS has seen high 
turnout on both sides of the 
aisle. According to an Epic/MRA 
poll that surveyed those who 
had already voted by absentee, 
surveyees leaned heavily toward 
Republican front-runner Donald 
Trump and former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton. 

The record to break is the 

1972 election, where 47 percent 
of registered voters cast ballots. 
There are some predictions that 
voter turnout could come close 
to 2 million voters and possibly 
make state history. 

Michigan ranks 
high in U.S. for fraud 
and ID theft reports

According to a new Federal 

Trade Commission report, 
Michigan ranks third in the 
nation for fraud and sixth 
for identity theft complaints. 
National levels of fraud and 
identity theft complaints have 
increased overall. 

More than half of those who 

make fraud complaints don’t 
actually hand over any money to 
the cons, but for those who are 
scammed, the median cost to 
each victim is $400. A majority 
of scams occur over wire 
transfer, and originate in the 
United States.

To explain why Michigan is 

targeted by scammers, Puneet 
Manchanda, a professor of 
marketing at the University 
of Michigan’s Ross School of 
Business, points to the large 
segments of immigrants and 
elderly people in Michigan. 
Older people are less tech-savvy, 
while immigrants might not be 
as well-informed on credit and 
banking procedures, increasing 
their susceptibility to scams. 

Manchanda proposes legal 

solutions to mitigate this 
problem. “Our legal systems and 
protections have not caught up 
with the realities of the digital 
world,” Manchanda said in 
an interview with the Detroit 
Free Press. “The scammers will 
always be ahead. The solution is 
regulation and education.”

Students for Sanders presi-

dent Nicholas Kolenda, an LSA 
sophomore, said Tuesday night 
that Sanders’s success should 
worry Clinton as he continues to 
do well in states he was predict-
ed to lose.

“Considering where he was 

just nine months ago, his prog-
ress has been immense” he said. 
“The fact that Sanders is still 
standing and viable despite the 
heavy front-loading of states 
favorable 
towards 
Clinton 

should worry the former Secre-
tary of State. Sanders’ campaign 
likely still has its best days ahead 
of it.”

In 
a 
statement, 
Sanders 

thanked Michigan voters, refer-
encing polliing data prior to the 
election that incorreclty indicat-
ed Clinton would win by signifi-
cant margins. 

“I am grateful to the people of 

Michigan for defying the pundits 
and pollsters and giving us their 
support. This is a critically impo-
rant night,” Sanders said. “Not 
only is Michigan the gateway to 
the rest of the industrial Mid-
west, the results there show that 
we are a national campaign.”

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) said he thought the stu-
dent vote — particularly coming 
out of Ann Arbor — likely gave 
the Sanders campaign an extra 
push in Michigan.

“I don’t think that there is any 

question that there has been a 
tremendous amount of energy 
and enthusiasm behind Sand-
ers lead by huge voices,” Irwin 
said. “I think Sanders campaign 
has really benefited from the 
momentum that student support 
can give him.”

However, 
Communications 

Prof. Josh Pasek noted that voter 
turnout numbers did not indi-
cate a significant increase in Ann 
Arbor.

“These numbers are not huge, 

but Bernie did seem to do very 
well,” he said. “It doesn’t suggest 
that we are seeing something 
truly overwhelming from the 
University itself.”

Pasek said Sanders’ success 

likely came from better ground 
organization and campaigning.

“I think it’s probably the case 

that the Sanders’ campaign was 
just better organized and did a 
better geo-TV job in the state 
of Michigan,” he said. “At least 
compared to what we thought 
we would see based on the pre-
election polls.”

One other state, Mississippi, 

held its Democratic primary 
alongside Michigan Tuesday, 
which Clinton won with close 
to 80 percent of the vote. With 
a total of 166 delegates available 
between the two states, Michi-
gan was the more impactful of 
the two primaries because of the 
130 delegates it had up for grabs. 
Despite the loss in Michigan, 
Clinton still maintains a lead in 
the overall delegate count. 

Both candidates had a strong 

focus on the state in the days 

leading up to the election, with 
Clinton and Sanders both rally-
ing in Michigan on Monday — 
Sanders on campus at the Crisler 
Center and Clinton in Detroit 
— where they discussed many 
familiar points and some Mich-
igan-centric issues.

The primary also follows 

a Democratic debate in Flint 
on Sunday held in partnership 
between CNN and UM-Flint. 
The debate spent considerable 
time discussing Michigan-cen-
tric issues including the Flint 
water crisis and Detroit Public 
Schools’ crumbling infrastruc-
ture.

Following Tuesday’s primary, 

most of the remaining delegates 
will come from more moderate 
and diverse states where Sand-
ers has not done as well in the 
past, in comparison to other 
states where much of his support 
comes from young white voters.

Pasek said Michigan’s pri-

mary determines whether Sand-
ers can do well in these types of 
states, indicating whether he still 
has a competitive chance at the 
nomination.

“Given that dynamic, Bernie 

needs to come relatively close 
to winning — if not to win — to 
show that he can really show 
that he can take a state that isn’t 
the kind of state that he has been 
winning so far,” he said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Taiwo 

Dosunmu, 
communications 

director for University’s chap-
ter of College Democrats, said 
before the polls closed Tuesday 
that the group hoped to continue 
Democratic momentum on cam-
pus, by encouraging students to 
vote by opening voter registra-
tion booths throughout the year 
and distributing information on 
polling locations.

Dosunmu added that while 

the group does not endorse any 
particular candidate, its main 
goal is to encourage students to 
vote.

“Our main goal is to have 

turnout be as high as possible,” 
he said. “On a college campus 
turnout is essential. When stu-
dents vote, Democrats are able 
to win.”

In his victory speech, Trump 

said he appreciated the decisive 
victory and the large turnout.

“To get these kinds of numbers 

where they call them immediately 
is just something else. I want to 
thank the people of Michigan,” he 
said. “One of the things I am very 
happy about is the turnout has just 
been massive for every week.” 

Communications Prof. John 

Pasek said Republican leadership 
has been looking for a candidate 
to oppose Trump in the primary 

as many see him as toxic to the 
party. However, he added that the 
Republican party has been unable 
to coalesce behind a single candi-
date.

Despite his relative success in 

Michigan, much of the party sees 
Trump as unelectable in compari-
son to other establishment can-
didates, Pasek noted. However, 
he said Rubio’s poor showing in 
Michigan may leave the party 
with Cruz as the only alternative 
to Trump.

The Michigan primary follows 

two presidential debates in the 
state, with a Republican debate 
held in Detroit last Thursday and a 
Democratic debate in Flint on Sun-

day. While the Republican debate’s 
focus stayed national, the Demo-
cratic debate spent considerable 
time discussing Michigan-centric 
issues including the Flint water 
crisis and Detroit Public Schools 
crumbling infrastructure.

Pasek said it is hard to know 

what issues in the debate truly 
impact voters because there are 
so many hotly contested issues 
throughout the course of the 
debate.

“When you have a reasonable 

contested debate it is hard to read 
which attacks are the ones that are 
working for the candidates and 
which are turning potential voters 
off,” he said.

NEWS BRIEFS

in the warmer months for an 
outside feel. The original main 
aisle of the market will remain 
the same as the new infrastruc-
ture will be constructed at 
what is currently a sandlot.

In a statement, the DDA 

board said they believed the 
newly renovated space will be 
an essential part of the com-
munity.

“It meets the mission and 

values of the DDA to strength-
en downtown, spark increased 
economic activity within the 
Kerrytown neighborhood, cul-
tivate a memorable sense of 
place and enhance walkability 
along north Fourth Avenue,” 
the board said.

David Santacroce, associate 

dean for experiential education 
and professor at the University 
of Michigan Law School and 
the chair for the Public Market 
Advisory Commission, said the 
project has been discussed for 
many years due to an ongoing 
need for a warmer space in the 
winter months.

“It’s been talked about forev-

er,” Santacroce said. “It’s very 
inhospitable in the winter to 
shop there, both for customers, 
but also for a lot of vendors who 
are now in recent years grow-

ing a lot more produce during 
the cold months.”

Some current vendors and 

city residents do not believe 
the funding allocation is the 
right option for improving the 
farmers market. Main rea-
sons for resistance of the new 
project are centered around a 
miscommunication of the mar-
ket’s needs: The physical area 
around the market will lose 
multiple parking spots, some 
vendors will need to move 
to different locations on the 
site and the DDA is spending 
more money than is needed to 
achieve an improved market.

There are over 120 market 

vendors throughout the year at 
the market, according to Mar-
ket Manager Sarah DeWitt. 
Many of those vendors want to 
sell year-round, she added.

However, several of the cur-

rent vendors said this week that 
they do not believe the funding 
allocation is the right option for 
improving the farmers market.

“We don’t want (the market) 

winterized, what we wanted 
was the main aisle winterized,” 
said Janna Fields, co-owner of 
Fieldfarms, a permanent ven-
dor at the farmers market. “I 
went to the Toledo market last 
fall; they have the exact same 
setup as we do, but they have 
roll-down shutters and radi-
ant heat and it only cost them 
$70,000.”

Nonetheless, despite some 

vendor 
disapproval, 
Santac-

roce said he believes the newly 
proposed space is important 
for maximizing the market’s 
potential.

“There’s also what we call 

the sandlot where the building 
would go. It’s not covered and 
not divided the way it could be 
because people have to bring 
their own tents and they only 
come in a certain size, so we 
are not maximizing the space 
of that area,” Santacroce said. 
“We want to better maximize 
that space so we can increase 
vendors, because there’s more 
vendors that we can’t accom-
modate, especially in the peak 
season.”

For at least some students, 

the heated space might make 
them more likely to attend in 
winter months, LSA junior 
Molly Weiss, who shops at the 
market, said.

“I think students will defi-

nitely take advantage of this 
new addition to the farmers 
market,” Weiss said. “For those 
living close to Kerrytown, the 
farmers market has always 
been such a great way to get 
local goods, and the winteriza-
tion of the market I believe can 
only help the business of ven-
dors. And students will be more 
likely to go.”

Guest Speaker
Sevig addressed the assembly 

Tuesday on the advances CAPS 
has made in recent months to 
provide resources to students. In 
particular, he discussed the CAPS 
after hours phone service which 
was launched in October 2015, an 
increase in students seeking ser-
vices and an upcoming event later 
this month on suicide prevention.

“We are the student counsel-

ing center,” he said. “We don’t 
exist just to exist for me, for the 
professional staff, and we don’t 
technically exist for the Uni-
versity. When we wake up in 
the morning our sole purpose 
is to care about is you, and your 
43,000 other classmates.”

Sevig said starting in the fall, 

all incoming students will be 
provided Mcards with the CAPS 
after hours phone service num-
ber on the back.

CSG has discussed endors-

ing this initiative multiple times 
in recent weeks, and passed a 
resolution supporting the new 
Mcards Tuesday.

The 
CAPS 
phone 
service 

went live on Oct. 5 of last year, 
and Sevig said it took two to 
three years to research and put 
together a functioning system. 
In the first months the line aver-
aged 70 to 100 calls, but in recent 

months the number has settled to 
an average of 65 to 70 per month, 
according to Sevig.

“This is a signal that the Uni-

versity does care about you,” he 
said. “They care about your men-
tal health, both crisis-oriented 
and from day to day. Also, we are 
not aware of any other colleges or 
universities that have put a men-
tal health-dedicated phone line 
on the back of their IDs.”

New Business
A new resolution was brought 

to the assembly floor Tuesday 
night regarding in-state tuition 
for nontraditional and undocu-
mented graduate students . The 
resolution states that, if passed, 
CSG will work with the Coali-
tion for Tuition, Migrant and 
Immigrant Rights Advocacy and 
other organizations to encourage 
the University to extend in-state 
tuition to these groups.

Currently, 
the 
University 

offers in-state tuition to undocu-
mented undergraduate students, 
following a vote to change the 
residency guidelines by the Uni-
versity’s Board of Regents in July 
of 2013.

One of the resolution’s authors, 

Public Policy masters candidate 
Luz Meza, said the proposed 
change would enhance campus 
diversity.

“Diversity isn’t a word that 

people just throw around,” Meza 
said. “It’s something that we are 
actively working on on campus.”

T

he 
summer 
after 
my 

junior year of high school, 
I found myself waking 

up at 7 a.m. 
every morning, 
without 
bothering 
to 

set an alarm. 
The sun came 
out, 
the 
day 

got going, and I 
couldn’t stay in 
bed any longer. 
Over the past 
week of break, 
something 
similar 
happened — I found myself 
naturally getting up anywhere 
between 7:45 and 8:30, ready for a 
jump-start on the day. I’d elected 
a number of morning classes this 
semester in the interest of getting 
myself up and going, getting 
my coursework done early so I 
could leave my afternoons open 
for working on assignments. 
But time management hasn’t 
been a strong suit lately, and 
sometimes homework has gotten 
away from me. More often than 
I’d have liked, I’ve found myself 
still awake at midnight, trying to 
finish the reading for a class at 
8:30 the next morning.

I know I’m not alone when I 

say I haven’t really been getting 
enough 
sleep 
this 
winter. 

According to a study conducted 
by the National College Health 
Assessment, roughly 19 percent 
of all students at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
both 
graduate 

and undergraduate, have some 
kind of trouble sleeping. This 
can be associated with trauma, 
emotionally disturbing events or 
even a lack of exercise during the 
week; regardless of cause, over 
30 percent of students did not 
feel adequately rested for five 
days out of the week.

“We know a lack of sleep 

impacts grades, but we’re not so 
sure about its effects on mood 
or 
the 
breakdown 
between 

different 
majors,” 
said 
Dr. 

Shelley Hershner, a researcher 
at the University of Michigan’s 
sleep 
lab, 
where 
tests 
and 

treatments for disorders such 
as sleep apnea are conducted. 
Hershner 
also 
practices 
at 

University 
Health 
Service, 

where she works to educate 
students about sleep in an effort 
to improve their sleep behaviors. 
“One of the primary functions of 
sleep is learning and memory,” 
Hershner said, adding, “We don’t 
know the entire purpose of sleep, 
but I would say one part of it is 
long-term potentiation,” that is, 
committing new information to 
long-term memory.

While I’ve prided myself on 

getting enough sleep, more or less, 
over the course of my education, 
Hershner 
said 
many 
students 

don’t feel the same way:

“For a lot of people, not getting 

enough sleep is almost like a 
badge of honor.” However, lack 
of sleep has a definite negative 
impact on academic performance. 
As Hershner points out, “You’re 
spending thousands to get your 
education, but sleep is one of 
the processes that allow you 
to learn.” Other impacts of too 
little sleep include a weakened 
immune system and a greater 
secretion of hormones that make 
you hungry. The benefits of a 
full night’s rest greatly outweigh 
the consequences of cutting into 
the time when you should be 
sleeping.

Short naps can help to make 

up the difference for those who 
can’t quite fit eight hours in each 
night, and Hershner quoted one 
study that showed a six-minute 
nap improves memorization by 11 
percent. For those who take more 
than half an hour to fall asleep, 
naps may not be the best way to 
increase the amount of rest they 
get in a day. Instead, Hershner 
recommends getting to bed just 
15 minutes earlier, or getting 
up 15 minutes later — if you can 
manage either or even both, for a 
total of 30 extra minutes, it can 
have a real impact.

Besides 
fitting 
in 
more 

minutes or hours of sleep each 
day, Hershner reminded me that 
students should also be more 
mindful of late-night caffeine 

or use of technology. The light 
given off by screens interrupts 
the production of melatonin, 
a 
hormone 
that 
signals 
the 

body to start preparing for 
sleep, Hershner explained. And 
caffeine can last for up to eight 
hours in your system, meaning 
that a late-afternoon coffee could 
leave you unable to fall asleep 
until sometime early the next 
morning. Hershner also told me 
of instances where people can’t 
fall asleep right away and start 
surfing Facebook or listening to 
music in an effort to relax, when 
really, all they’re doing is waking 
themselves up more.

My goal for each evening 

isalways to take an early shower, 
get in bed before 11, and promptly 
turn out the lights. Over the past 
couple of months — OK, for the 
majority of my young-adult life 
— I haven’t been very on top of 
these goals, but it doesn’t mean 
I’ll stop trying. Just knowing 
what to be aware of — avoiding 
bright lights and caffeine — can 
help. If I can, I like to read for 
pleasure or write in a journal 
before I turn off the lights, 
which is a more effective way of 
relaxing than staring at a screen. 
To this day, I have managed 
not to pull an all-nighter — 
what’s not finished in the late 
afternoon, I get around to in the 
morning.

“We spend a third of our life 

in sleep. It’s vital,” Hershner 
reminded me. I’m all for a good 
night’s rest, if for no other reason 
than because it gives shape to my 
days. It rejuvenates body and 
mind, leaving me refreshed and 
better prepared for whatever 
the next day might hold. And 
I’ve found it’s a great excuse for 
eating breakfast..

If you’re interested in finding 

out more about your own circadian 
rhythms and whether you’re more 
of a “morning” or “evening” person, 
Hershner recommends a simple 
questionaire available on the online 
version of this column.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

The magic number is 2,383. That is 

how many delegates are needed to win 
the Democratic Party’s nomination for 
president — to be the 
standard-bearer for the 
43.1 million members of 
the Democratic party in 
November. Though the 
race is far from over, the 
front-runner 
is 
clear. 

Bernie 
Sanders 
has 

confounded critics and 
pundits with victories in 
seven states, yet he still 
trails 
significantly 
in 

delegate count. Sanders 
may 
have 
exceeded 

expectations with his narrow victory in 
Michigan last night, but, ultimately, the 
delegates will be split and Clinton will 
walk out of Super Tuesday Part II with an 
expanded lead in terms of delegates. Barring 
any substantial change, Hillary Clinton will 
accept her party’s nomination on stage in 
Philadelphia this July; but if she’s smart, 
Bernie will be there too, on a Clinton-Sanders 
unity ticket that would almost surely win.

As much success as he has enjoyed, the 

Vermont senator has had too much trouble 
with some key Democratic voting groups to 
be the nominee. The base of the party is a 
multiracial one — in 2012, Obama was elected 
by a diverse constituency that was, according 
to Jeet Heer’s recent opinion piece for the 
New Republic, “56 percent white, 24 percent 
black, 14 percent Latino, and 4 percent Asian.” 
Heer goes on to point out that “By contrast, 
Mitt Romney’s electorate was 89 percent 
white, 2 percent black, 6 percent Latino, and 
2 percent Asian. Clinton’s coalition looks like 
Obama’s; Sanders’s looks like Romney’s.” This 
is reflected by the states he has won, which 
are overwhelmingly white — Vermont, New 
Hampshire, Oklahoma and a close second in 
Iowa.

Sanders may struggle with appeal to 

minority voters, but he would make the 
perfect pick for vice president, adding 
everything 
to 
the 
ticket 
that 
Clinton 

cannot. Where Hillary has struggled to 
appeal to younger voters and millennials, 
Bernie has excelled. College campuses 
“feel the Bern,” nearly without exception. 
Additionally, though exit polls indicate 
that Democrats would be willing to vote for 
whichever candidate wins the nomination 
in November, Sanders would continue to 
draw massive crowds, bring new voters into 
the political process and excite the base. His 
message resonates with independents and 
moderates, standing in stark contrast with 
Clinton — an establishment figure flush with 
superdelegates and endorsements.

Furthermore, Sanders has consistently 

set the agenda on the Democratic side and 
steered the rhetoric that has governed both 
campaigns. In December and January, the 
conversation was about what it meant to be a 
progressive, a title he wears proudly. Clinton 
then spent weeks on the trail touting her 
credentials as a “progressive who gets things 
done,” courting voters and support on the 
left wing of her party. Recently, in her Super 
Tuesday victory speech, it was obvious that 
Clinton has taken a page out of her opponent’s 
book; she discussed income inequality and the 
role of corporations in our society, bemoaned 
the burden of student loans and called for 
“more love and compassion” in this country. 
To lose Bernie in the spotlight would be to lose 

the north star of the Democratic platform, a 
risk that Clinton cannot afford to take.

Hillary Clinton is viewed by many to be 

untrustworthy, cold, elitist and too closely tied 
to Wall Street — what better counterbalance 
than the likable, warm and populist Sanders, 
whose campaign is fueled by donations that 
average less than $30? Imagine how sharply 
her public image could change with Bernie’s 
charm and warmth at her disposal.

Granted, there would be drawbacks to 

this ticket. The party of diversity might not 
be best served by nominating two white 
New Yorkers whose combined age is 142. 
It might be difficult to reconcile Bernie’s 
desire for certain proposals that have been 
central to his campaign — universal health 
care and breaking up the big banks — with 
Clinton’s more moderate approach. And I 
have heard one question each time I have 
discussed this: Would Bernie even want to 
be Hillary’s VP?

Of course he would. For 35 years, since 

he was elected the mayor of Burlington, 
Vermont, he has been saying the same thing. 
He has been standing up for civil rights, 
the middle class and campaign finance 
reform. Watch floor speeches he made as a 
congressman in the 1990s — the wording has 
changed, but the message is the same. And 
for the first time since he began his career in 
politics, Bernie’s brand of liberalism has been 
resonating with millions of people. He has a 
microphone, and I doubt he’s willing to give 
it up just yet. At no point in his campaign has 
he expressed hatred or even any substantial 
animosity toward Hillary, saying often that 
she is qualified and calling her a friend. With 
the potential to follow in the foot steps of Joe 
Biden and Dick Cheney as strong political 
voices in the office of vice president, Sanders 
would surely enjoy substantial influence in 
the Clinton White House.

Perhaps the most obvious benefit of a Vice 

President Sanders to those in Hillaryland, 
however, would be the contrast between the 
two parties in 2016. Voters would see a broken 
party system in which the front-runner is a 
reality television star who is often racist and 
sexist, enjoying a casual relationship with 
the truth. The Republican race in 2016 has 
been a circus in which it is acceptable to make 
comments on the debate stage about the size 
of Donald Trump’s manhood. What’s more, 
the alternatives to Trump are the widely 
disliked Ted Cruz and the establishment 
favorite Marco Rubio, who inexplicably has 
only won one state and has resorted to a policy 
of “if you can’t beat him, join him” by implying 
on the campaign trail that Trump may have 
wet his pants, and reading some of his tweets. 
Because that is presidential.

A Clinton-Sanders ticket would unite the 

party. The Democrats would seem like the 
adults. Bernie would bring everything to 
the ticket that Hillary cannot, along with 
countless intangibles that she could not get 
from any other establishment pick or career 
politician. In early February, when asked 
about whether she would consider Bernie 
as a VP pick on the debate stage in New 
Hampshire, Hillary said, “If I’m so fortunate 
as to be the nominee, the first person I will 
call to talk to about where we go and how we 
get it done will be Senator Sanders.”

No one should be surprised if the ticket is 

set in stone by the time she hangs up.

Late 
last 
month, 
protesters 

marched through the streets of 
Ann Arbor and many other cities 
(including 
several 
thousand 

protesters in New York) to demur 
the conviction of ex-officer Peter 
Liang, the Asian-American NYPD 
cop who was convicted of second-
degree manslaughter after his gun 
accidentally discharged and struck 
Akai Gurley, an unarmed Black 
man, in the stairwell of his Brooklyn 
apartment building. Though Liang 
was supposed to administer CPR to 
his victim, he failed to do so as Mr. 
Gurley lay dying on the steps of his 
own residence.

The protesters claimed that 

Liang was only convicted because 
of 
his 
Asian-American 
racial 

identity, and he was consequently 
used as a scapegoat by the justice 
system (with the implication being 
that if Liang were a white officer, 
he would have avoided any formal 
punishment). The demonstrators 
brandished 
signs 
that 
read 

“condolences to Akai Gurley, justice 
for Peter Liang” and chanted 
“equal justice for all” throughout 
the protest. Regardless of what 
they explicitly said, however, many 
people, 
including 
myself, 
only 

heard a group asking, “Why can’t 
we get away with killing unarmed 
Black men, too?”

I am in no way trying to 

diminish the very real roadblocks 
the Asian community faces in 
this country. From unfounded 

prejudices 
and 
stereotypes 
to 

flat-out 
discrimination, 
Asian 

Americans are no strangers to 
the racist tendencies of American 
society. 
However, 
demanding 

“justice for Peter Liang” implies 
that justice has not already been 
served, or even worse, that being 
found guilty of second-degree 
manslaughter 
is 
somehow 
an 

injustice 
— 
that 
true 
justice 

would only be achieved if the 
court treated Liang with greater 
leniency 
or 
dropped 
charges 

altogether.

Second-degree manslaughter is 

defined as either a crime of passion 
that was not premeditated or — as it 
pertains to Liang — “a killing caused 
by dangerous conduct and the 
offender’s obvious lack of concern 
for human life.” While I am about as 
far from a legal scholar as one can 
get, it doesn’t take a Supreme Court 
justice to see that not announcing 
your presence while your finger is 
on the trigger is dangerous conduct, 
and standing idly while your victim 
dies helplessly shows little concern 
for human life. Peter Liang is guilty 
of 
second-degree 
manslaughter, 

and in my eyes — and the eyes of the 
court — the only injustice would be 
for him not to be charged with a 
crime he obviously committed.

To quote an op-ed from one of 

my coworkers at the Daily, “Since 
1999, there have been more than 
175 fatal shootings in New York 
City by on-duty officers. Of these, 

only three have led to indictments… 
only 
one 
shooting 
led 
to 
a 

conviction.” That statistic is why I 
feel the conviction of Peter Liang is 
just. For far too long, police officers 
have been treating their access 
to weapons like a hunting permit 
against oppressed minorities.

At long last, the justice system is 

standing up for the voiceless who 
are killed without a second thought. 
Even if this is a one-time thing, even 
if Officer Liang is being used as a 
scapegoat, calling his punishment 
an injustice is disingenuous. The 
fact that other officers get off when 
they kill unarmed minorities is the 
real injustice, not the fact that Peter 
Liang was convicted. Likewise, 
the other officers’ killings do not 
make Peter Liang’s shooting of 
Akai Gurley any more acceptable. 
Instead of asking myself, “Why 
should Liang be convicted when 
other officers are not?” I’m hopeful 
that in the future, all cops who kill 
innocent people — regardless of 
race —will be given the same justice 
that Officer Liang received.

Though 
I’m 
not 
optimistic 

that future officers who shoot 
guiltless people will receive similar 
treatment, this conviction is still a 
step in the right direction, because 
at least someone is finally being 
held accountable for killing an 
innocent person.

JASON ROWLAND | OP-ED


I

t was a Wednesday night 
in early March. We had 
spent the day wander-

ing the narrow, balcony-lined 
streets of New Orleans, stop-
ping 
in 

quaint 
book 
shops and 
swaying 
to 
pop-

up 
brass 

bands 
in 

the center 
square. 
There was 
a 
breeze 

coming 
off the Mississippi, bringing 
with it the briny smell of fish 
and centuries old stone houses.

And vomit. There was a 

distinct smell of vomit as my 
friends and I made our way from 
bar to bar down the infamous 
Bourbon Street, encountering 
new 
friends 
(alleged 
New 

Orleans Saints players) and new 
challenges (a drink consisting 
solely of grape slushie and 
Everclear) along the way. As 
we approached our destination 
we let out shrill giggles in 
anticipation; we were doing 
something none of us, as former 
student council representatives 
and current homebodies, had 
done before. Feeling young and 
alive and independent, singles 
in hand, we walked into the Bad 
Boys of Bourbon Street, an all-
male strip club.

Confession: I saw “Magic 

Mike” in theaters three times. 
(Once was actually at a drive-
in.) When Channing Tatum’s 
star-making film about male 
strippers with big dreams and 
hearts of gold came out in 2013, I 
told everyone who would listen 
about how good it was. The film 
is surprisingly smart, unafraid 
to dig into the class and racial 
dynamics 
that 
complicate 

the stripping industry. And 
Tatum is excellent, pulling 
from his own stripping past to 
bring a conflicted gravity to a 
character that could have been 
just a meathead. I would whip 
out these reasons whenever 
anyone questioned the film’s 
integrity, 
or 
my 
obsession 

with it. But without fail, every 
conversation would inevitably 
end with me saying, “And 
c’mon, it’s hot guys stripping.”

What can I say: a girl wants 

what she wants.

The Bad Boys of Bourbon 

didn’t disappoint. The boys 
were hot, they could move, 
and they did their damnedst 
to engage the cozy Wednesday 
night crowd. I watched as my 
friends threw singles on the 
stage and even participated 
in 
the 
show, 
unabashedly 

reclaiming this place as theirs.

I 
love 
objectifying 
men. 

Really, it’s one of my favorite 
pastimes, other than reading 
biographies for pleasure and 
drinking wine from a box. It 
may sound shallow, or even 
callous, but in a world built 
on the constant, unrelenting 
objectification of women, I feel 
no guilt in turning the tables. 
I watch certain shows solely 
for the man candy. I stare a 
beat too long at the cute boy 
across the airplane aisle. Last 
week I even called a statue of 
Andrew Jackson “foxy as all 
hell.” (Like I said, a girl wants 
what she wants.) There is an 
empowerment in assuming the 
traditionally masculine angle 
of removing a person’s inner 
self from their physicality, in 
acting unapologetic of your 
primal instincts.

Take “Grandfathered,” the 

FOX comedy starring John 
Stamos 
(“Fuller 
House”) 

and Josh Peck (“Drake and 
Josh”). It’s not a great show, 
at times sharp and pithy but 
all too often sweeping in its 
characterizations. But my best 
friend and I watch it every week, 
in part pulled in by our libidos 
— she’s an Uncle Jesse fan while 
I prefer Peck’s former-chubby-
kid adorableness. As a TV snob, 
it’s a rarity for me to watch a 
show for aesthetics alone, but 
it’s refreshing to watch with 
half a brain, to whoop at the 
shirtless scenes like a bored 
frat bro.

“The Good Wife,” too, plays 

a cat and mouse game with my 
sex drive, as Alicia Florrick 
has reignited her sexuality and 
got some over the show’s seven 
season run. Alicia treats sex in 
a traditionally masculine way; 
when she wants it, she wants it, 
no strings attached. While this 
may complicate her own life, 
it invigorates mine. When her 
boss Will passionately kissed 
her in an elevator in season 
two, I rewound multiple times, 
and proceeded to tweet that 
all I wanted was to make out 
with someone in an elevator. 
When she pulled her estranged 
husband into a back room for a 
midday quickie in season four, I 
cheered. This season, when she 
hooked up with her grizzled 
investigator in her darkened 

office, my friend texted me her 
excitement in all caps, and I 
responded with a resounding 
“YASSSS.”

It shouldn’t come as a shock 

that women like sex. Women 
have attractions and urges just 
like men, whether they be for 
Channing Tatum or disgraced 
19th century presidents. I find 
admitting these feelings to 
be an open act of feminism, a 
response to millennia of women 
functioning solely for men’s 
sexual desire.

And yet. As I sat in the 

Bad Boys of Bourbon Street, 
I 
couldn’t 
help 
but 
feel 

irrevocably, 
deeply 
icky. 
I 

couldn’t 
remove 
my 
own 

sensibilities from the situation; 
I couldn’t just be a man about 
it. What were these men’s real 
names? Did they always want 
to strip, or was this a stepping 
stone for some other dream? 
Do they have families, children 
relying on the money coming 
in from this Wednesday night 
show? Do they even want to be 
here?

I ran out in a panic, texting 

a friend “I feel like this is so 
violating.” That to support 
the industry didn’t feel like a 
feminist move. That I found 
it all really sad, and not at 
all sexy. I was confused; I’m 
pretty open about my sexuality, 
and I wholeheartedly support 
compensation for patriarchal 
wrongs. 
Maybe 
I’m 
more 

prudish than I thought, but 
I found the institution to be 
irredeemably abusive.

Can 
there 
be 
feminist 

retribution in recreating an 
industry that was established 
through eons of the normalized 
sexualization 
of 
women’s 

bodies? Just because men can 
pay to enter a dark room and 
watch a woman they don’t 
know remove her clothes, and 
have been able to do that for 
centuries, does it mean I should 
feel comfortable doing it in the 
reverse? I don’t think so. I want 
it to be easier, I want equal to 
be the same as equitable; an eye 
for an eye, or more pertinently, 
a tit for tat. But an institution 
founded 
in 
a 
society 
of 

objectification, of debasement, 
of violence, can’t be turned on 
its head and made clean. As the 
phrase goes, an eye for an eye 
means the whole world’s blind. 
And I need my sight to keep 
watching “The Good Wife.”

See ‘Foxtrot’ for Tina 
Fey and witty script

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Film Editor

“Well, we saw 

it for Tina!” said 
my dad said as 
we drove home 
after 
seeing 

“Whiskey 
Tango Foxtrot,” 
starring 
the 

aforementioned 
Tina 
Fey 

(“Sisters”). “We 
saw it because 
we like her.”

I can’t say this is untrue. 

When 
I 
saw 
the 
ads 
for 

“Whiskey 
Tango 
Foxtrot,” 

starring Fey, produced by her 
SNL mentor Lorne Michaels 
and her husband Jeff Richmond 
and written by her “30 Rock” 
show runner Robert Carlock, 
there was a part of me hoping 
it would be the story of Liz 
Lemon working as a journalist 
in Afghanistan. That part of me, 
the same part that would fall 
asleep listening to Tina Fey’s 
book “Bossypants” on my CD 
player in high school, was not 
disappointed.

Based on the book “The 

Taliban Shuffle” by the film’s 
real life inspiration Kim Barker, 
“Whiskey 
Tango 
Foxtrot” 

follows journalist Kim Baker, 
who 
leaves 
her 
uninspired 

life in New York City for an 
international 
assignment 
in 

Kabul. Her arrival is chaotic 
and reflected in the turbulent 
and 
shaky 
editing, 
which 

quickly calms as Kim adjusts 
to life in the “Kabubble,” as 
the characters affectionately 
call journalistic life in the 
city. Kim instantly bonds with 
Tanya 
Vanderpol 
(Margot 

Robbie, 
“Focus”) 
the 
only 

other female journalist living 
in their guest house, which 
more 
closely 
resembles 
a 

continuous collegiate frat party 
than a living space for adults. 
But that’s the dichotomy of 
womanhood in the Kabubble 
— 
it’s 
acceptable, 
even 

encouraged, for these women to 

get blackout drunk and wild in 
the guest house, but it’s equally 
acceptable for strangers to call 
them whores if their heads are 
uncovered outside of the house.

Kim 
embeds 
herself 
in 

the 
military 
presence 
in 

Afghanistan and finds herself 
surprisingly 
addicted 
to 

the adrenaline rush of war 
reporting, much to the chagrin 
of both the top Marine officer 
in the area (Billy Bob Thornton, 
“Our Brand Is Crisis”) and her 
“fixer” 
Fahim 
(Christopher 

Abbott, 
“James 
White”). 

Kim 
and 
Fahim’s 
cultural 

differences 
provide 
fertile 

ground for witty one-liners 
about their personalities and 
relationship — she’s a cynical 
workaholic from New York and 
he’s a traditional young Afghan 
man trying to keep her safe. But 
the truly noteworthy aspect of 
their relationship is its caring 
yet platonic nature. There are so 
few filmic models of emotional 
connections between men and 
women without sexual motives, 
not just in the industry as a 
whole, but also in this movie. 
Pretty much every other man 
besides Fahim propositions Kim 
to have sex with him. Whether 
it’s a licentious Afghan attorney 
general (Alfred Molina, “Love 
Is Strange”) casually showing 
her the bed in his office or a 
photographer trying to look 
down her shirt when she’s 
passed out after a particularly 
rowdy party, Kim is constantly 
negotiating the gender politics 
of adapting culturally while 
successfully doing her job.

Fey, with plenty of previous 

experience in roles arbitrating 
the complexity of femininity 
in the workplace, strikes this 
balance 
almost 
perfectly. 

Before the third act, during 
which both the audience and 
Kim realize she’s been in the 
Kabubble for too long, the film 
strikes a harmonious balance 
between romantic comedy and 
war story.

And 
yet, 
critics 
and 

audiences alike are putting 

“Whiskey 
Tango 
Foxtrot” 

on trial for whitewashing its 
Afghan actors. Racism and 
problems with diversity are 
ubiquitous in Hollywood today, 
from the casting of Zoe Saldana 
as Nina Simone in an upcoming 
biopic to the recent “Gods of 
Egypt,” in which the gods in 
the North African nation are 
predominantly 
white. 
But 

“Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” is 
different. Tina Fey, who was 
also a producer on the film, says 
she requested a native speaker 
for the part of Fahim, but that 
the casting directors chose 
Christopher Abbott as the best 
person for the job. There are also 
the specificities of Afghanistan 
that distinguish it from other 
cases of whitewashing. Afghans 
can be Caucasians, making 
it conceivable that someone 
from 
Afghanistan 
could 

resemble Abbott. But there’s 
also a question of safety for 
the actors and their families. 
The film’s inspiration, Kim 
Barker, tweeted that “The most 
‘authentic’ people to play Fahim 
and Sadiq are Afghans, not 
people from the Middle East, 
or Pakistan or India…But what 
happens if there’s a reaction in 
Afghanistan against that actor’s 
family? … The Afghan boys who 
starred in the movie “The Kite 
Runner” had to go into hiding.” 
She went on to say that “This 
movie looks like Afghanistan! 
And the extras were Afghans 
speaking Dari and Pashto. That 
made me happy.” While there 
should be an effort to improve 
diversity 
in 
cinema 
today, 

there was never a moment 
in “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” 
that didn’t feel authentic to its 
inspirations or locations.

“Whiskey 
Foxtrot 
Tango” 

is a balancing act, teetering 
between 
absurdist 
comedy 

and a tragedy in a war-torn 
country in which almost 10,000 
American troops still remain. 
The movie doesn’t always stay 
upright, but Fey’s trademark 
sense of humor pulls it back up 
when it falters.

Daily Book Review: 
‘Sweetgirl’ a success

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Percy James is used to picking 

up after her mother Carletta, 
a woman who has trouble 
staying 
away 
from 
drugs. 

When Carletta disappears in 
the middle of a blizzard, her 
daughter grudgingly sets off to 
find her, more annoyed than 
worried. But when she stumbles 
into a house and finds a wailing 
baby by an open window, alone 
except for two passed out drug 
addicts in a room downstairs, 
she 
makes 
a 
split-second 

decision to grab the baby and 
run. She soon realizes she has 
more pressing problems than 
a MIA mother strung out on 
meth.

The 
heroine 
of 
Travis 

Mulhauser’s 
debut 
novel 

“Sweetgirl” 
possesses 
every 

trait that you would imagine 
the heroine of this kind of 
story to have. Think Jennifer 
Lawrence’s 
character 
in 

“Winter’s Bone” meets Hailee 
Steinfeld’s character in “True 
Grit.” She’s unyielding and 
sardonic and refuses to be 
vulnerable and has a chip on 
each shoulder, but she’s also 
determined and self-sacrificing 

and courageous.

Percy takes baby Jenna — 

whom she subsequently refers 
to mostly as “Sweetgirl” — 
from the house because she is 
freezing and on the verge of 
becoming ill, and Shelton Potter 
and his girlfriend (the drug 
addicts) don’t look like they’re 

in any shape to be taking care of 
a child. She takes Jenna to her 
mother’s ex-boyfriend, Portis, 
a gruff yet caring borderline 
alcoholic who helped raise 
Percy and her sister once upon 
a time. She knows that he’ll help 
her, despite grumbling about it 
first. The urgency of finding 
Percy’s mother and getting 
Jenna to a doctor escalates 
once 
they 
realize 
they’re 

being pursued by Potter — and 
various members of his gun-
toting posse.

There 
are 
a 
few 
subtle 

indicators that “Sweetgirl” is 
a debut novel. The continuous 
switch between Percy’s first 
person narration and the third 
person narration that follows 
Potter is sometimes jarring 
and 
unequal. 
While 
Potter 

is 
an 
intriguing 
character 

psychologically, the parts of the 
narration that follow him and 
his dealings with threatening 
men are less interesting, and 
throughout the novel there 

are a few turns of phrase that 
don’t quite fit in with the rest 
of the book’s brusque style; the 
elegance of more sophisticated 
language feels imposing on the 
gritty, simple wording of the 
rest of the novel. Percy describes 
baby Jenna’s “strength” on a 
few occasions; though romantic 
in sentiment, this doesn’t quite 
ring true. A baby who gradually 
stops 
crying 
generally 
isn’t 

exhibiting emotional strength 
for her guardian’s sake — she 
has tired herself out.

A 
couple 
deaths 
in 

“Sweetgirl” are true plot twists, 
shocking in their abruptness. 
However, though they change 
the direction of the story, they 
aren’t utilized solely as plot 
drivers — but neither are they 
given space to be mourned. 
They’re given the amount of 
time they take to occur, then the 
remaining characters move on.

Other than Percy and Portis, 

the characterization of the rest 
of the cast is bleak; there are no 
shining heros or vibrant villains. 
No one is fully good or fully evil. 
Though this sometimes drains 
the energy from the pages, it 
also makes it more realistic.

Yet there are a few things that 

stick with you once you close 
the book — a short yet gorgeous 
description of the ocean, the 
stealthy, sucking power of a 
small town, how wallowing in a 

state of melancholy can feel more 
real than bouncing around in a 
state of fleeting happiness and 
the possibility of finding hope in 
a final goodbye. Written in sharp, 

staccato sentences, “Sweetgirl” 
is sprinkled with brittle pieces 
of bone-dry truth about what 
it’s like for a kid to grow up 
faster than she should have to.

What can I say: 

A girl wants 

what she 
wants.

Milan FW in review

By DAILY STYLE WRITERS

Ah Milan, what some insist as 

the fashion capitol of the world, 
even ranking above Paris. It is 
the birthplace of many high fash-
ion couture houses, which have 
exuded elegance and innovation 
in handmade and luxury designs. 
These include famous names like 
Giorgio Armani, Versace and all 
the way to Gucci. Each year fashion 
designers, enthusiasts and blog-
gers alike make the trek to Milano 
all the way in the northern region 
of beautiful Italy. While our style 
writers weren’t fortunate enough 
to join them, it doesn’t mean we 
cannot sit in awe at the glamour 
exuding from every stitch of fabric 
in the collections from this year, 
and review from afar. 

Armani
The morning after Leonardo 

DiCaprio finally claimed his first 
Academy Award, the man who 
dressed 
“The 
Revenant” 
star 

delivered his Fall 2016 ready-to-
wear collection in Milan. The col-
lection’s namesake quite literally 
summarizes Giorgio Armani’s lat-
est creation: “Black Velvet.” In the 
words of Vogue’s Nicole Phelps, 
“This collection was a study in how 
to make black velvet a viable option 
for day[time].”

The designer took modern day 

staples such as running pants, tai-
lored coats, ties, and of course, crop 
tops, but went a step further and 
offered a reworked version of each 
in black velvet. Armani balances 
the fuzzy fabric’s omnipresence on 

the essentials with smaller sam-
plings on the accessories. Touches 
of black velvet can be found on 
the pockets of tweed blouses, the 
cuffs of multicolored coats and on 
oversize black bowties, making for 
a chic assemblage of the fabric du 
jour.

Armani’s “Black Velvet” was 

au courant with the rest of Milan 
fashion week, with velvet emerg-
ing as one of the biggest trends 
out of the Italian fashion capital 
this season. The luscious fabric 
also graced the runways of Arthur 
Arbesser, Roberto Cavalli, Alberta 
Ferretti and Emilio Pucci. While 
velvet also made a showing last 
season, it seems designers are not 
too eager to let go just yet. —Jordan 
Stern

Blumarine
The roaring ’20s are back with 

Blumarine’s latest collection. Sheer 
jumpsuits, sequins and fur make a 
name for themselves in this show. 
Fur at the hem of longer coats, fur 
necklines, fur hats — think fur 
everywhere, people. Shimmering 
long skirts are mesmerizing while 
watching the models stroll down 
the catwalk. Leopard and floral 
prints are also a theme throughout 
this daring collection.

The detailing is feminine and 

gives us a sense of delicacy. The 
pieces are so incredibly classy, in 
fact, that if each of these particu-
larly clothed models were stand-
ing in a room full of fashion’s best, 
everyone else in the room would 
still automatically be reduced to 
“trashy.”

Nothing in this show made me 

step back and think wow, but as a 
whole it was a very nice collection. 
Feminine, old school and classy, all 
of these Blumarine pieces would 
be perfect to wear when attending 
a Gatsby-themed party. So as soon 
as I’m invited to a party of such 
extravagance, I’ll be sure to turn to 
this collection. 

—Hannah Sparks
Gucci
It’s been one year since Ales-

sandro Michele was appointed cre-
ative director of Gucci. Though he 
hasn’t had much time at the helm, 
it’s as if he’s created ages worth of 
work in 12 short months, already 
being subject to people aping the 
designs and aesthetic he’s been 
crafting for Gucci in this new era.

Michele peddles an amalgama-

tion of his favorite aesthetics, trod-
ding outfits down the runway that 
exude equal parts ’70s Italian sport 
culture, Renaissance art and vin-
tage biker grunge. Each model and 
outfit was a cohesive cultural expe-
rience on its own, featuring dia-
mante sunglasses, disco sandals, 
velour hats, socks with Gucci’s loud 
striped graphic, pearl and crystal 
juxtaposed against colors like rain-
coat yellow and magenta. Not only 
is there an eclectic combination of 
styles and imagery, but Michele 
seamlessly draws from each of 
them to craft a beautiful smorgas-
bord of colors and looks, something 
he aptly compares to “talking in 
more than one language.”

Michele’s latest showing for 

Gucci was a blatant assault on the 
subtleties of Europe’s more estab-
lished fashion upper echelon. 
Bombastic, 
ostentatious, 
color-

ful and loud, the experience of 
Michele’s show was fairly atypi-
cal to Gucci’s quintessential calm 
Italian aesthetic. He has no desire 
to be “cool,” to immediately fit in 
with his trendy colleagues or the 
creative directors that came before 
him. He has a confident, collected 
approach toward fostering his loud 
and frenetic style. The more free-
dom he has to explore it, the more 
fortunate the fashion world will be. 
—Anay Katyal

Prada
There’s good news and there’s 

bad news. I’ll give you the good 
news first. All of the shoes in this 
show were so unique and so very 
“Prada” — it was amazing. Wheth-
er it was the platform oxfords with 
a chunky buckle, the heels, or the 
lace up boots, all in all, the shoes 
were on point. Going further, the 
handbags were obviously chic AF. 
Maybe it’s a personal bias, but I 
always tend to be more impressed 
with Prada’s bags and shoes, I 
mean, what’s not to love? There-
fore, I suppose you, the reader, 
could take this review with a grain 
of salt. 

Now for the bad news — the 

clothes were tragically ugly. Per-
sonally, I was especially discour-
aged and questioned my taste once 
the show ended. The crowd was 
roaring with applause. I just want-
ed to yell, argyle, they’re bringing 
back argyle! What really killed 
me were the thick argyle tights, a 
frightening flashback to my ele-
mentary school days.

I was especially put off when 

the models came out wearing coin 
purses around their necks. Is this a 
thing in Milan? Am I behind on the 
times? On another note, there was 
a reoccurring theme of sailor hats; 
I’m not entirely sure what the point 
of them was, but it was all some-
what concerning.

Maybe it’s just me, and maybe 

I’m not as fashionable as I thought, 
but I was incredibly unimpressed 
with this show. If I had to assign 
a letter grade to this collection, it 
would be a C. Sorry Prada, but you 
let me down. — Hannah Sparks

‘Dog’ explores life

Laurie Anderson’s 

emotional film 
tackles grief.

By JOE WAGNER

Daily Arts Writer

“Heart of a Dog,” Laurie 

Anderson’s 2015 film, is similar 
to a traditional movie in that it 
has a narrative, 
moving 
images 

and sound, yet 
it 
is 
somehow 

different. 
To 

watch 
“Heart 

of a Dog” is a 
wholly 
distinct 

experience from 
watching 
“Star 

Wars,” 
yet 
we 

call them both 
movies.

Anderson weaves vignettes 

that don’t quite seem related 
to one another or even to the 
film as a whole, yet combines 
and transitions between in 
them in such a brilliant way 
that it’s impossible to notice 
the story moving forward. But 
perhaps it isn’t. The viewer 
isn’t progressing through time 
and through story but rather 
moving cyclically, experiencing 
one part of the story and then 
another part but then returning 
to 
the 
first. 
Repeating, 

returning, tumbling through 
time.

This isn’t to say that “Heart of 

a Dog” does not have a narrative. 
Its narrative is compelling. 

It is thought provoking. It is 
beautiful. It is everything a 
“movie” should be. However, it 
does so in a nontraditional way. 
The form of the movie mirrors 
the movie thematically.

“Heart of a Dog” is a story of 

death, of life, of dogs, of loved 
ones, of the modern world, of 
Buddhism. It is a story of human 
and spiritual experience. The 
film brings one through life 
and loss, through death and 
rebirth. Anderson uses her dog, 
Lolabelle, as a guiding thread 
through the movie, departing 
from and returning to the life 
of her dog. She ventures off to 
topics as distant as 9/11 and 
ranging as far as the Bardo (a 
purgatory state between two 
lives) of Buddhist philosophy, 
but 
is 
constantly 
exploring 

and understanding death, love 
and life. Anderson reads her 
poetic film to the audience 
like a storybook to children. 
By breaking the fourth wall 
and addressing the audience 
directly, she creates both a filmic 
reality and a meta-filmic reality. 
The audience is enveloped in the 
film, swallowed by the reality of 
the movie while simultaneously, 
at least at certain instances, 
aware of the experience of 
watching 
Anderson’s 
poem 

unfold on the silver screen. 
Conscious, and unconscious. 
Aware and unaware.

The 
imagery 
is 
as 

outstanding as the narrative 
of the movie is. Anderson 
chooses images which possess 

natural associations with the 
narration even if they are not 
strictly what she describes. She 
utilizes a variety of types of art. 
Anderson makes use of iPhone 
footage of her dog, sketches of 
her dog in the Bardo, footage of 
the West Village seen through 
the eyes of her dog, a painting 
by Goya, footage of Northern 
California and manipulations 
of 
still 
images. 
Through 

breathtaking transitions, these 
seemingly individual works of 
art are combined into a new, 
indivisible whole. Just as the 
narrative is cyclical, so is the 
imagery. 
The 
film 
repeats 

certain images while moving 
to and fro between others. 
Anderson creates interesting 
composition, 
whether 
it 
be 

through manipulation of what 
seems to be still photos or 
through upside-down camera 
angles putting the ocean at the 
top of the frame and the beach 
underneath. The compositions 
are atypical in that there is not 
a singular spot intended for the 
eyes to concentrate and observe. 
Rather, the compositions force 
the eyes to constantly move 
and study everything that lies 
within the frame and think 
about everything beyond the 
frame. 

Gliding through life, death, 

and love and powered by the 
human 
experience, 
Laurie 

Anderson’s “Heart of a Dog” is 
a unique film, both beautiful 
and thought provoking, unlike 
anything else made in 2015.

Five Things We Learned: 
Michigan’s Spring Break

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team’s 

Spring Break trip did not end 
exactly as it would have hoped. 
The 
19th-ranked 
Wolverines’ 

final two games against UC Davis 
were canceled due to the rain, 
leaving them with a 3-3 record in 
their trip to California.

Despite suffering his first 

losses on the season, Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich believes there 
are teaching moments in every 
game. Here are five things we 
learned from Michigan’s early-
season trip out west.

1. Michigan’s starting pitchers 

are really good …

Sophomore 
left-handed 

pitcher Oliver Jaskie had another 
impressive 
outing 
for 
the 

Wolverines. Against Michigan’s 
chief opponent, No. 9 California, 
Jaskie managed to toss 5.1 innings 
of three-hit, no-run baseball. 
Bakich praised Jaskie for his work 
ethic and performance after his 
earlier start against Canisius, but 
his stellar start has been a pleasant 
surprise for the Wolverines.

Sophomore right-hander Ryan 

Nutof suffered his first loss of 
the season, but he impressed 
nonetheless. Nutof picked up a 
victory in his first start of the 
season by shutting out Saint 
Joseph’s. In his next start against 
UC Davis, Nutof surrendered 
just two earned runs, but did not 
get the necessary run support to 

erase the deficit.

Junior lefty Brett Adcock also 

took a loss in his start against Cal 
Poly. However, his stat line told 
another story. Adcock pitched 
3.1 innings, striking out seven 
batters and not allowing a hit.

Overall, Michigan’s starters 

allowed no more than four runs in 
any of their games in California, 
and the staff is currently boasting 
the fifth-best earned-run average 
in college baseball at 1.59.

2. … But its defense isn’t.

Despite outstanding pitching 

and a serviceable offense, the 
Wolverines’ defense has already 
cost 
them 
games. 
Michigan 

committed errors in every one of 
its contests over the break.

Up 3-2 in the sixth inning 

against UC Davis, sophomore 
infielder Jake Bivens overthrew 
a ball to first base. Instead of two 
runners on with one out, Nutof 
had to pitch in a no-out, bases-
loaded jam. A single and fielder’s 
choice gave the Mustangs a 4-3 
lead and the eventual victory.

“We made a couple of costly 

errors that led to two unearned 
runs against UC Davis,” Bakich 
said. “Sometimes the growth 
comes from learning from your 
mistakes.”

A Michigan error also cost a 

run against San Jose State to ruin 
the Wolverines’ chances at their 
fourth shutout of the season. The 
Spartans continued to surge with 
four runs in the fifth inning to 
tie the game, 5-5, but a double by 

Bivens in the sixth inning secured 
a 6-5 win for the Wolverines.

3. The 7-8-9 hitters are still up 

in the air.

While the first six hitters in the 

Wolverines’ lineup have remained 
consistent in their 10 contests thus 
far, the backend of the lineup has 
seen a number of changes.

Junior infielder Michael Brdar 

has started every game thus far, 
but has not solidified a permanent 
spot in the lineup. He has seen time 
in all of the bottom three spots. 
Junior catcher Harrison Wenson 
— who leads the team with three 
homers so far this season — has 
also started every game, but was 
the seventh batter in two games in 
California. Wenson has typically 
hit in the No. 5 spot.

Besides Brdar and Wenson, 

Bakich 
has 
also 
shuffled 

freshman outfielder Jonathan 
Engelmann, freshman infielder 
Ako Thomas and junior outfielder 
Johnny Slater in and out of the 
lineup at the bottom three spots.

4. Michigan has yet to 

establish itself.

With 10 games under its 

belt, Michigan is yet to build an 
identity. Defense, offense and 
pitching have all had their ups 
and downs, but have rarely all 
come together at once.

The same team that swept 

Canisius and shut out the top-10 
Golden Bears has also suffered 
defeats to UC Davis, Santa Clara 
and Cal Poly. Each game is a 
matter of which Michigan team 
decides to show up.

Though disappointed by the 

losses, Bakich says that he cares 
most about how the team has 
handled each loss.

“We’ve got knocked down 

a couple times, and we’ve got 
back up,” Bakich said. “I think 
our guys have done a good job of 
responding to small amounts of 
adversity we’ve experienced.”

5. Bold Prediction: Michigan 
will sweep Hawaii, averaging 

at least nine runs a game.

Win 
or 
lose, 
Michigan’s 

pitching has been dominant to 
start the season. It’s time that 
the offense follows suit. Les 
Murakami Stadium in Honolulu, 
Hawaii, should be a good stadium 
for the Wolverines’ offense to 
pick up, measuring just 325 feet 
to left and right field.

The Rainbow Warriors are 

131st in ERA in college baseball 
at 4.49, and the Wolverines will 
be the biggest challenge that they 
have encountered so far.

With 
so 
much 
attention 

focused on the pitching staff, it 
will be Michigan’s bats that will 
shine against Hawaii.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico’s team should find itself back in the WNIT when the brackets are announced Monday.
‘M’ awaits WNIT fate

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

Since the 2012-13 season, the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team has failed to make the 
NCAA Tournament.

And after a short stay in 

Indianapolis for the Big Ten 
Tournament last week, it looks 
like that drought will live on 
another year.

The 
Wolverines 
(9-9 
Big 

Ten, 17-13 overall) don’t boast 
the strongest record, and they 
struggled to collect any “big 
wins” that could swing the 
selection committee into giving 
them a shot. The 64-team NCAA 
Tournament field will almost 
certainly leave out Michigan — 
which finished at a tie for seventh 
in the Big Ten — so on deck for 
the team is the Women’s National 
Invitation Tournament.

While the men’s NIT features 

just 32 teams, the WNIT includes 
a full 64, and the Wolverines 
certainly won’t be left out of that.

But exactly where Michigan 

falls between No. 65 and No. 128 in 
the country is anyone’s guess.

The team has put together a 

strong enough season to earn a 
high seed in the WNIT, which 
potentially would allow them to 
host a handful of games.

Instead of playing at neutral 

sites, the team that records 
a 
higher 
average 
attendance 

generally hosts, a feature that 
played well to the Wolverines 
advantage last year when they 
went all the way to the semifinals.

Last year’s WNIT run ended 

with a loss to the eventual 
champion, 
UCLA. 
And 
even 

though it wasn’t the NCAA 
Tournament — which is always a 
goal for the team — Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico mentioned that 
the tournament provided the 
team, especially then-freshman 
guard Katelynn Flaherty, with 
invaluable experience.

Thursday, 
Flaherty 
scored 

31 points against Iowa at the 
Big Ten Tournament, setting a 
single-season scoring record for 
Michigan with 677 for the year.

Flaherty’s 
record-breaking 

season was the biggest reason the 
team had a chance of reaching the 
Big Dance this year.

Flaherty led the Wolverines to 

plenty of almost-wins against top 
teams like No. 5 Maryland and No. 
9 Ohio State, and the first-team 
All-Big Ten selection played a big 
role in sweeping a solid Minnesota 
team led by Naismith Award 
semifinalist Rachel Banham.

Regardless, Michigan couldn’t 

build its résumé over the past few 
months, and it lost control of its 
postseason destiny as the season 
wound down.

The following weeks should 

determine how the Wolverines 
stack up on the national scale, 
which 
has 
been 
difficult 
to 

interpret all year.

The Wolverines’ third straight 

WNIT appearance should be 
confirmed this coming Monday, 
March 14, when the selection 
committee 
reveals 
the 
final 

bracket a day after the NCAA 
Tournament’s Selection Sunday.

The first round of the WNIT 

will be held from March 16 to 
March 18, and the Wolverines will 
expect to play at Crisler Center 
sometime in that frame. But as 
always, nothing is guaranteed.

All they can do now is wait. 

Quick Hits with Michigan 
sophomore Tony Calderone

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Writer

Sophomore 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone likes to shoot the puck. 
And that was on full display this 
past weekend during the home-
and-home Ohio State series.

Calderone’s nine shots led the 

Wolverines in that category. He 
also led the team with three goals. 
His 96 shots on the season slot 
him in third on the team, behind 
junior forward Tyler Motte and 
freshman forward Kyle Connor, 
respectively.

Heading into this weekend’s 

series 
against 
Penn 
State, 

Calderone agreed to join the Daily 
for this week’s edition of Quick 
Hits.

The Michigan Daily: You 

shoot the puck a lot according to 
the stats. Do your linemates ever 
get angry with you for shooting so 
much?

Calderone: (Laughs) No. They 

haven’t said anything yet, at least. 
I like to think they give me the 
puck so I can shoot it.

TMD: 
(Junior 
defenseman) 

Michael Downing seems to shoot 
a lot on the power play. Do you talk 
to him about that?

Calderone: (Laughs) On our 

power play, we like to get the puck 
to the net, and I think he does a 
good job with it, so I can’t get on 
him about it too much.

TMD: When you got here this 

season, you were paired with two 
freshmen. Was that an insult?

Calderone: Not an insult. They 

both had impressive track records 
coming in, so I was excited to play 
with some fresh guys and show 
them the way.

TMD: Who would you least like 

to room with on the road?

Calderone: 
(Sophomore 

forward) Dexter Dancs. I live 
with the guy, and he’s a pretty 
obnoxious roommate.

TMD: Why? Because he is 

dirty?

Calderone: No. He’s just loud. 

He plays music a lot. He just is 
loud.

TMD: Why do you think 

(senior netminder) Steve Racine 

has his own room on the road?

Calderone: He needs to stay 

mentally focused. He’s a guy who, 
if he has too many distractions, he 
could lose focus.

TMD: 
(Sophomore 

defenseman) Cutler Martin was a 
forward once again this weekend. 
How’d you like that?

Calderone: He did well. He’s 

played 
that 
fourth-line 
role, 

hitting guys, shooting the puck. 
He adjusted to it pretty well.

TMD: You were the first pick of 

the United States Hockey League 
draft back in the day. What was 
that like?

Calderone: It was cool. (My 

family) was watching the draft on 
our computer and my named pop 
up, and it was awesome. It was a 
big deal for my family, especially 
because I was out the year before.

TMD: 
You 
grew 
up 
in 

Michigan. Did you play on that 
travel team with all the kids on 
this team?

Calderone: I played on Victory 

Honda 
with 
Shuart, 
Cutler, 

(sophomore 
forward) 
Niko 

Porikos, 
(sophomore 
forward) 

Alex 
Talcott 
and 
(freshman 

goalie) Chad Catt.

TMD: You must’ve been good.
Calderone: We went to the 

state finals and we had norovirus, 
so we had just six people on the 
bench. I went to the hospital for 
four days. It was a mess.

TMD: So when the norovirus 

came back to Ann Arbor, what 
were you thinking?

Calderone: All the guys, we 

joked, “Not again, not again.” It 
was horrible.

TMD: Does it surprise you 

that (freshman defenseman) Joe 
Cecconi would tell his grandfather 
to put more money on his debit 
card 
during 
the 
norovirus

Partridge settled 
into new position

New linebackers 
coach rose from 

high school ranks in 

just 15 months

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Before Jan. 1, the last football 

game Chris Partridge coached 
on the field was at MetLife 
Stadium in East Rutherford, 
N.J., on Dec. 5, 2014.

Back then, he was the head 

coach 
at 
Paramus 
Catholic 

(N.J.) 
High 
School, 
alma 

mater of Michigan redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers. That 
December night was his fourth 
straight appearance in the state 
championship at the home of the 
NFL’s New York Giants and Jets.

His 
Paladins 
lost, 
34-18, 

ending a two-year win streak, 
and it has been a wild ride for 
Partridge since then.

Last season, Jim Harbaugh’s 

first as Michigan’s head football 
coach, Partridge served as the 
director of player personnel. 
When 
former 
defensive 

coordinator 
and 
linebackers 

coach D.J. Durkin took the head 
coaching position at Maryland, 
Partridge was appointed the 
interim linebackers coach for 
the Citrus Bowl against Florida.

Suddenly, Partridge was back 

on the field in a similar-sized 
stadium but on a much bigger 
stage.

“It doesn’t get any better 

for me,” Partridge said. “It’s 
awesome. It’s what I love. I’m 
on the field, I’m coaching, I’m 
getting after it.”

Tuesday night, Partridge came 

out into the Towsley Museum 
at Schembechler Hall, stood 
in front of more than a dozen 
reporters and said, “Whoa.” He’s 
not in New Jersey anymore.

As big of a leap as Partridge 

has made in 15 months, he insists 

that it hasn’t been as difficult a 
transition as people would think. 
During the month coaching 
linebackers in preparation for 
the bowl game, he could lean on 
the leadership of three seniors 
— Joe Bolden, Desmond Morgan 
and James Ross. Now, the focus 
shifts toward next season, when 
he will have to mentor an entirely 
new group of linebackers.

“It’s 
just 
a 
challenge,” 

Partridge said. “We gotta get 
some young guys ready to go, 
and we got some great guys 
that are coming back that have 
played a lot of 
football, too.”

Despite the 

loss of three 
important 
seniors, 
Partridge 
has plenty of 
help. Just like 
the 
players, 

he 
spent 

last 
season 

learning from 
a coaching staff of almost all 
former NFL coaches, including 
departed 
special 
teams 

coordinator John Baxter. Baxter 
went back to take the same 
position at Southern California, 
but Partridge soaked up all of 
the knowledge he could and 
eventually added Baxter’s old 
role to his duties in January.

Michigan’s first-year defensive 

coordinator, Don Brown, is also a 
former linebackers coach who 
can help Partridge.

“It’s 
like 
a 
clinic 
here,” 

Partridge said. “I can carry 
a notebook around and write 
something new that I learn 
every single day.”

Last year, as director of player 

personnel, Partridge observed 
and learned from the coaches 
but also coordinated Michigan’s 
recruiting effort. He watched 
film on prospective players, 
talked to high school coaches 
and families and set up visits for 
recruits. He observed recruits 

with their families, in school 
and on the field. And then he 
prepared to take the next step.

“You attack any role you 

have,” 
Partridge 
said. 
“I 

attacked last year like it was the 
best role I could ever have, and I 
got a new one. Maybe I like this 
one a little better, but I’m just 
going to attack it 110 percent and 
do whatever I can for the team.”

Though Partridge was often 

around the facility, he was 
virtually unknown by redshirt 
junior linebacker Mike McCray.

“I knew who he was, but I wasn’t 

around him a 
lot,” 
McCray 

said. “I didn’t 
think he would 
know 
about 

what we did as 
linebackers. 
I 

knew he was 
a 
great 
high 

school 
coach. 

That’s the only 
thing I knew, 
really.”

By all accounts, the move has 

worked out so far. Harbaugh 
praised Partridge’s work as 
director of player personnel last 
season, and he said in December 
he 
would 
do 
everything 

possible to keep Partridge in 
Ann Arbor, promoting him to a 
full-time assistant position as 
soon as he could.

As 
it 
turned 
out, 
that 

chance came in January, and 
Partridge accepted, reaping the 
benefits of sticking around (he 
reportedly had prior offers to 
coach elsewhere).

“I wanted to be a coach, 

and (Harbaugh) knew that,” 
Partridge said. “You work hard 
in your job and you get those 
opportunities, but in your heart, 
this is the place I wanted to be. 
I had to put my trust in him, 
and just knowing that I wanted 
to coach for Jim Harbaugh and 
I wanted to be at Michigan 
and I believe in this place, and 
fortunately it worked out.”

Desperation fuels ‘M’

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

Monday 
night, 
Michigan 

coach John Beilein sat down 
with his team and discussed 
down-on-their-luck teams that 
were able to pull away during 
the 
conference 
tournament 

to 
ultimately 
make 
NCAA 

Tournament runs.

After the Michigan men’s 

basketball team (10-8 Big Ten, 
20-11 overall) lost four of its 
last five Big Ten games to close 
out the regular season, it will 
likely need to win at least two 
games to safely land an NCAA 
Tournament bid. Beilein hopes 
his squad can pull off a similar 
feat, and desperation seems to 
be fueling it.

“When you’re in the NCAA 

Tournament already, it’s hard 
to go down there (to the Big Ten 
Tournament) — we value the 
regular season so big, so much,” 
Beilein said. “And then you don’t 
win it and you know you might 
be in the NCAA Tournament, it 
is tough, you’ve gotta just keep 
your kids focused on trying to 
win it all.”

Now that his team is on the 

other end of the stick, with no 
guarantee at all of making the 
NCAA Tournament, he said that 
he “absolutely” feels that the 
Wolverines will be playing with 
a feeling of desperation. After 
all, if they lose to Northwestern 
in their first Big Ten Tournament 
matchup, their chances of getting 
a bid are close to zero. Even with 
a victory over the Wildcats, they 
will need to take down Indiana, 
the conference champion, the 
following day to feel better about 
their shot of hearing their name 
on Selection Sunday.

Michigan closed out its regular 

season with a loss to No. 16 Iowa. 
To most, it was considered a must-
win game, but the conference 
tournament 
provides 
an 

opportunity to start fresh.

“We were really down after 

that loss,” Beilein said. “We 

didn’t play well, we didn’t play 
smart, we didn’t do a lot of 
things. We’re down. We watched 
the video yesterday, and it even 
made us feel worse. But now 
we’re going onto practice and we 
said, ‘OK, it’s done. Put it away 
and let’s move forward.’ ”

Junior guard Derrick Walton 

echoed his coach’s sentiment 
and added a positive outlook to 
Michigan’s reaction to its loss 
to Iowa.

“Guys on this team really 

care,” Walton said. “To be 
down about the game obviously 
showed that we care. We just 
gotta brush it off now at this 
point. We can’t go back now and 
change anything.”

Though Walton agrees with 

his coach in some aspects, 
he disagrees with others. He 
expects his team to be playing 
with 
a 
different 
mindset 

come 
Thursday 
afternoon 

in 
Indianapolis, 
but 
he 

wouldn’t give the Wolverines a 
“desperation” tag just yet.

“I think desperation is a word 

we probably wouldn’t want to 
use right now,” Walton said. 
“I think that puts too much 
pressure on ourselves. We’ll 
go out and perform as best as 
possible. I feel like if we put it all 
together like we know we can, 
this can be a big stretch for us.”

Whatever 
is 
fueling 
the 

Wolverines, 
whether 
it’s 
a 

different mindset, blind hope 
or desperation, it’s making an 
impression.

In Michigan’s final do-or-die 

situation before the Big Dance, the 
Wolverines seem to be fully aware 
of the Big Ten Tournament’s 
potential repercussions. 

“I’m expecting our guys to 

play a little pissed off, pretty 
much,” Walton said. “We’re just 
not happy. … You can just expect 
this team to play with a bigger 
chip on their shoulder.”

Wednesday, March 9, 2016 // The Statement

Dear Readers, 

Since the formation of Michigan in Color 

(MiC), students, faculty, staff and alumni 
of color at the University of Michigan have 
courageously 
shared 
powerful 
stories, 

meaningful observations, analytical cri-
tiques and inspiring art. Despite the context 
of operating within a Primarily White Insti-
tution (PWI), people of color have contin-
ued to make their voices, their experiences 
heard. As MiC strives to be more inclusive, 
more critical and more supportive of the 
marginalized voices both on campus and in 
wider society, we welcomed the opportuni-
ty to collaborate with other sections of the 
Michigan Daily.

The Statement and MiC are extremely 

thankful for the opportunity to use our plat-
forms to provide necessary space and pro-
mote important issues and voices within the 
larger University community.

Sincerely, 

Michigan In Color and Statement Editors

on the 
record: 
debate

W

hen I was eight, I fell in love for the first time. She 
was adventurous and dramatic and daring. Her 
qualities were the antithesis of everything I was.

I met her at a Border’s shelf in the children’s version of the 

biography section. Her name was Nellie Bly, and I’m pretty 
sure she made baby Tanya the feminist I am today.

For those who may not know, Nellie Bly was an investiga-

tive journalist who became the first woman to travel around 
the world — solo, I might add — in under 80 days on a hot air 
balloon. The largest thing she brought on her trip was her 
tub of cold cream. Nellie was also known for being a killer 
investigative reporter, once going to a women’s mental insti-
tution undercover to discover the extent of horrifying abuse 
toward the patients.

For Nellie, kicking ass and taking names was just a regular 

Tuesday and the young, wide-eyed me was instantly enam-
ored with her. 

I’d always been drawn to stories, whether it was reading, 

telling, writing or listening to them. Journalism, good jour-
nalism — whatever your definition of it is — is all about tell-
ing a compelling story, and Nellie did just that. So, as soon as 
I started digesting every piece of information about her life 
and work, I was hit with an overwhelming fascination with 
journalism as a medium for storytelling.

Now, this didn’t all happen at once in that little Border’s 

biography nook; it was a gradual realization.

For the present me, however, due to a series of circum-

stances and expectations — not to mention lack of real talent 
— writing professionally will not pan out as a viable career 
option. Nevertheless, my love for a good story holds stead-
fast.

It’s why I still pursue writing as a hobby and why in the 

11 years since I was eight, I’ve found many writers that have 
captivated me and become formative to my character: Jane 
Austen, J.K. Rowling and John Steinbeck to name a few.

You’ll notice that all of the writers I’ve listed in this col-

umn are white. A majority of the individuals I’ve read from 

or written about, whether it is for academia or fun, have been 
white writers from upper-middle-class backgrounds.

I can name the South Asian writers I know and have read 

on one hand. In fact, I can do it for you right now: Jhumpa 
Lahiri, Aziz Ansari, Mindy Kaling and Mira Nair. Only one 
— Jhumpa Lahiri — is part of the embarrassingly few writ-
ers of colors that I’ve gotten the opportunity to read from in 
school.

It bothers me that I can wax poetic about a white writer, 

like I did for a majority of this column, without hesitation, 
but struggled to move beyond Lahiri in naming more South 
Asian writers.

There are stories about Nellie Bly going on epic adven-

tures in search of the truth for the greater good. There are 
South Asian women who might have done the same, but I 
sure wouldn’t have found them in the biography section 
of the Border’s store. It’s not because they didn’t exist, but 
because they weren’t deemed important enough to be recog-
nized and cemented in history. 

Yes, Nellie Bly was a powerful and independent woman. 

Undoubtedly, she was a great person to look up to and admire 
for a timid young girl like me, but I can’t help but wonder 
what kind of an impact it would have made on me if Nellie 
had been brown.

Maybe I would have pursued writing as a career if I had 

seen a brown girl do it. I’d have realized that saving the 
world and flying on hot air balloons across the globe were 
adventures I could take too.

But still, maybe not. The point is, I’ll never find out, will I?
Somewhere out there is a young Desi girl who’s perusing 

through the aisles of an independent bookstore, a library or 
a Barnes & Noble. A young girl with actual talent for writing 
and the tenacity to go on epic adventures around the world. 
She deserves to find someone to read about and read from 
who looks like her, just so that girl can realize that she can 
kick ass and take names too.

Wednesday, March 9, 2016 // The Statement 

Is it possible to grow up simultaneously being aware of your skin and feeling detached 

from it?

Skin was always important.
It’s not just what covers your internal wiring and keeps you from spilling out onto the 

street.

It’s not just that thin, vulnerable layer above your blood and bones and organs.

Skin has always been important, but at the same time not.
My skin was always my skin. Not important because i wasn’t important.
But important to everyone else, for some reason.

***

“Why are you so hairy and dark?”
Said by one of the few darker-skinned girls in my elementary school, one who always 

hung out with the thin, blonde white girls who were never really my friends, but i still 
needed their approval. What could i say to that question? Did i point to my mixed family 
background? Did i explain away why i looked different from my fair-skinned father and 
sister? i pulled my plaid uniform down to cover as much skin as possible and said noth-
ing to a girl who looked more like me than she wanted to admit. That night, i begged my 
mom to let me shave my legs for the first time, hating how my coarse, black hairs only 
made me look darker.

“Cinnamon.”
Was it in fourth grade when i first heard that word? A spice with which i apparently 

shared an outer coloring? It confused me. i would stare at the brown of my arms, the 
fading scars, and wonder what it meant to be “like cinnamon.” Was i just a spice? Was 
i simply flavoring for a society that empowers those who are not like me? If i was cin-
namon, what did that make them? Cream? Flour? Milk? Were we all ingredients in some 
dysfunctional recipe; was our skin the most important thing we had to contribute to this 
dessert?

“Nice mustache!”
Yelled by a boy whom i had never spoken to before. He was a grade above me and had a 

reputation for being a poor student. His brother was in my grade and didn’t like that i had 
to tutor him in every subject. The teachers all liked me; i could have told someone, any-
one, about his constant insults, but i stayed silent and cried into my bagged lunch. A year 
later, my mom took me for my first session of full-body laser hair removal. The technician 
told me i had to stay out of the sun for as long as i did the treatment, and that combined 
with the laser could cause depigmentation. i was 12. The treatments lasted for two years.

***

Skin has always been important, but at the same time not.

“How do you stay so tan in Michigan? What salon do you go to?”
“I just came back from a week at the beach, I’m almost the same color as you!”
“You’re so lucky you’re olive! I bet you don’t burn at all!”

Now, wait. i am olive? i stare at my face, searching for the resemblance. Could i be both 

Olive and Cinnamon? How could i explain what it felt to be constantly defined as food? 
Was my skin meant to be devoured, chewed on and spit back out with a description that 
was easier to digest?

***

The importance of skin was how easily i could tear it off.

My school skirt hid the scratch marks on my thighs. My mother’s strong skin passed 

down to me kept the scars from staying too long before disappearing among the dark 
freckles and sun spots.

How could i feel comfortable in my own skin, when no one around could seem to agree 

on its significance? Am i my skin? Am i nothing more?

“You have to tan,” my mother would say, “you’re too pale,” my mother would say, as 

if staying out of the sun for too long would cause my Latina-ness to slip away from me.

How could i feel comfortable in my own skin?
How could i feel anything other than desperation, wishing i could shed it for new, 

uncomplicated, easy-to-define skin?

How could i do anything other than tear at it over and over, digging in sharpened nails, 

wishing i could be nothing more than a skeleton?

***

This is the identity crisis of being unsure of your identity. When your identity is said to 

be tied to your skin, but no one is clear when they try to define it.

“You’re not Latina, you’re white.”
“So, are you, like, half-White?”
“What exactly are you?”

i stare blankly at these words that have no meaning, that serve no purpose but to send 

me spiraling into a confused wreck. the disconnect between my dark skin that othered 
me as a child and the lighter skin that allowed me to sometimes blend in with the rest as 
an adult created an abyss inside me into which i fell deeper and deeper with each contra-
dictory descriptor.

i am olive? i am cinnamon? i am white? i am brown?

i am Dark when it is convenient to them, when they call me Exotic and Ethnic and 

Different.

When they make jokes about my emotions, my anger, my desire to see myself repre-

sented in society. When they equate my success to my skin tone, as if my hard work is 
invalid because my skin is different from theirs.

“Why aren’t there scholarships for white people?”
“I bet I would have gotten accepted to Ivy Leagues, too, if I was like you — if I wasn’t 

white.”

“Yeah, I knew you weren’t from here, that’s why you got into Michigan.”

i am White when my skin makes them uncomfortable, when they want to call me “One 

Of Them,” and laugh and nudge me in solidarity and i don’t say anything about how them 
doing this is tearing me apart, about how i feel like my stomach is going to empty itself 
involuntarily when they say our skin is the same because they don’t have to sit and listen 
while the covering of their bones is turned into a fetish, when they’re told they’re not 
really “American” because they look and speak differently, when their skin is given terms 
like “Cafe con Leche,” like “Caramel,” like “Light Mocha,” like “Chai,” like “Cinnamon,” 
like “Olive,” like anything but what it is which is mine it is my skin and it is treated like 
an item for consumption.

***

Skin was always important, wasn’t it?

Wednesday, March 9, 2016 // The Statement 
5B

In August of 2013, I flew across the country, from Los Angeles to Ann Arbor 

and stepped onto a campus surrounded by thousands of individuals I had never 
seen before. I anxiously prepared to begin my adventure at the number-one public 
school in the nation.

Most of the freshman girls I came into contact with asked me the same question 

in my first week at the University: “Are you gonna rush?” At first, the answer was “I 
don’t know,” because I really didn’t, but everyone seemed to be doing it, so maybe 
“Why not?” I thought. Don’t people think sorority girls are annoying? Pretty? 
Fun? All of these girls walked around campus flaunting their bright letters on their 
matching tank tops over their bikinis, with their long blonde hair and summer tan 
skin; I couldn’t help but want to be a part of it. The idea of being a sorority girl 
intrigued me. I was part of a cheer team for 10 years, I thought, It has to be similar 
right? The “I’m Shmacked” videos looked wild and fun (possibly concerning, now 
that I think about it). And Michigan is notorious for its tailgating, which I assumed 
necessitated being part of Greek life.

A few days went on.
I told my parents my decision to rush a sorority, and in the moment I was beyond 

thrilled. They were completely supportive of my decision, but I knew they were far 
from it. [COPY: this contradicts itself. Maybe “they seemed/acted supportive”?] 
“Are you sure?” my dad said, and “Have you really thought about it?” which was 
followed by, “Is that what you want to do?” by my mom. I didn’t understand why 
they were concerned. I wanted to be a sorority girl. I wanted to be pretty and cool 
and fun — and at that point in my life, being in a sorority was the only way.

It only took about three long, tiresome, uneasy weeks for me to understand my 

parents’ concerns. I may have been naïve, but I didn’t think my race would play a 
part in my experience in Greek life. Coming from a white suburban neighborhood 
and attending predominately white public schools my whole life, I knew that I was 
comfortable in majority white spaces. I assumed that my life at the University of 
Michigan wouldn’t be much different than my experiences at Beverly Hills High 
School. Little did I know, an African-American woman rushing in Panhellenic 
recruitment was a pretty rare sight. Now I understand why.

For those of you who do not know how sorority recruitment works, I will do my 

best to break it down.

There are 16 Panhellenic sororities on campus. When the process begins, each 

girl goes to every house and has conversations with multiple members of that 
sorority. After each “round,” you rank your choices, putting your most desirable 
houses at the top. There are three rounds, and then preference parties. Through 
each round, you narrow down the amount of houses you have through a “cutting 
system.” Normally, it decreases from 16, to 11, to seven, and eventually to three for 
preference parties. The cutting system is mutual, meaning that in addition to the 
girls “cutting” the houses they don’t want, the houses can do the same. Girls don’t 
always get the houses back that they want, which is completely normal. However, 
I felt as though my case was extreme. After the first round of cuts, most girls had 
11 houses. I was left with only five. After the second round of cuts, most girls had 
seven houses. I was left with only two. This meant I didn’t even have the complete 
amount of three houses for preference parties.

My self-esteem was shot. I didn’t understand why I was not being given a chance 

in any of the sororities. I asked myself, if I couldn’t even find an accepting house, 
how I would be able to make friends at such a large school. First, I attributed all 
of my “cuts” to my hair being frizzy, which I was already self-conscious about (it 
was my first summer in humid Ann Arbor). I constantly ran a straightener over 
my hair, trying to make it as flat and straight as everyone else’s. Other than my 
hair, I thought I was doing fine with the process. I am perfectly capable of having 
a genuine conversation, and I felt as if I brought great qualities to each house. It 
was evident that some of the girls in the houses may not have agreed. Soon, I came 
to realize that my brown skin may have not been the “look” these girls wanted in 
their homes. Nothing explicit happened to make me feel this way, but there was 
a sort of uneasiness I felt when heads turned as I walked into the houses. During 
conversation, it seemed like these women weren’t particularly interested in 
learning more about me; in some cases, I knew I would be cut the second I walked 
out of the front door. I began to understand my parents’ concerns, and even though 
I refused to admit it to them — or anyone around me — I knew they were right.

I did end up getting a bid (or, an invitation) to join a sorority that I enjoyed 

through the process. Once I opened that envelope and saw the name, I jumped 
up and down with pure joy. However, my excitement wasn’t because I got a bid 
to my dream house, it was because I finally felt wanted. I realized that by the end 
of recruitment, I was no longer looking for the house that was my best fit; I was 
looking for any house that would accept me, and that was the problem.

Since middle school, I’ve constantly been asked a question. A question 

that I thought was harmless if not some teasing fun. A question that has real 
implications unlike the question of whether I shower with my hijab on (I 
don’t! Why would this make sense?), if I have an arranged marriage (No. Also, 
don’t ever ask that again.), and if a boy sees my hair if I’ll be forced to marry 
him (…No. No. No.). Rather a question that I never truly thought about ‘til I 
was asked it again recently.

“What would your dad do if you (insert action)?”
A. He would disown you.
B. He would hurt you.
C. He would lock you up.
D. Would ship you to India.
E. None of the above.

People love talking about my dad. And not about his occupation, his life 

story, his favorite foods, what sports team he roots for (he always switches 
so he ends up supporting the winner) or his experience as a brown Muslim 
man. Rather people love talking about what my dad would do to me if I were 
to disappoint him.

First, there is an assumption that my dad is overly controlling and angry.
Usually the question “What would your dad do?” is followed by either 

“if you took off your hijab,” “if a boy saw your hair” or “if you went out to 
a party.” First, there is an assumption that I do not have autonomy over my 
body, second, that my father forced me to wear hijab, and third, that any of 
these actions would justify an angry response from him.

Also, to answer the multiple-choice question above, the answer is E.
It took me years to realize how ridiculous these questions were. When you 

ask me that question, you are being racist. No argument. You are reiterating 
centuries of Orientalist ideals when you assume that as a brown woman I have 
no autonomy of my body and that my own father oppresses me. Let me assure 
you that I wear my scarf for no man, and that it is a decision I made on my 
own and for myself. And despite what your question implies, the relationship 
between my father and I is one of love and respect.

***

When you see my Dad you see a tall, overbearing brown man. You see my 

oppressor. You see a man who apparently only knows harshness and violence. 
You see images of terrorists, of barbaric men, of violence, the same images 
that are shared in the media, reflected on my father’s face. I feel sorry for you, 
because you aren’t able to truly see him.

When I see my Dad the first thing I look for are his crow’s feet, which 

appear just before his smile does. I see his hands, which held four daughters 
as he broke borders and oceans to be able to provide. I see a man who learned 
to verbalize his love, not for his own sake, but for mine, so that I should never 
doubt it. I see the person who taught me love in actions and sacrifice.

***

To my father:
Dear Baba,
I’m sorry you live in a world where brown men are seen as heartless. I’m 

sure if everyone met you, you would be able to unravel the stitches of time 
that so strongly hold onto the ideals of what brown masculinity look like. I’m 
sorry that you traveled so long to be in a country that is not deserving of your 
patriotism or love. I’m sorry that you traveled for your children, only for them 
to unlearn your mother tongue.

Thank you for showing me what dedication, commitment and love look like. 

Thank you for loving me at my worst self and for pushing me to be my best. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for taking care of me when I 
forget to take care of myself. Thank you for reminding me the importance of 
patience. Thank you for being a source of strength.

Once I was in the sorority, I immediately tried to assimilate to the culture of Greek life. Given 

its isolated nature, I easily broke ties with anything non-Greek. I only sat with people in class 
who had Greek letters on their laptops, my weekends consisted of parties with only a few select 
fraternities and I wouldn’t dare go to the dining hall without my sorority sisters. I never hung out 
with people of color. In fact, in my sorority of over 200 girls that currently attended Michigan, I 
was one of very few women of color and the only Black woman.

Throughout my freshman year, I was very happy. I experienced some of my best memories thus 

far, made great friends and fell in love with this University. But, in retrospect, I am now aware that 
I wasn’t able to fully be myself in many ways. It seemed impossible to show my true colors while 
simultaneously fitting into a sorority. I felt trapped. I don’t think I befriended anyone outside of 
Greek life until the end of that year.

During my sophomore year, I started learning about the Black community at Michigan and 

found ways to get myself involved. I made more friends and attended Black events for the first 
time. This was happening while I was living in a three-story sorority house with over [COPY: more 
than; over refers to space] 60 girls, where I was the only African American. Once I started going 
to Black events, I realized the range of possibilities that Michigan had to offer. There was a whole 
world that I had been completely oblivious to, because I was so caught up in my sorority. When 
I started doing things outside of my sorority, I was questioned. A lot of the girls were completely 
unaware that Black Greek life existed — they did not understand why there were spaces that 
belonged to minorities. I found myself always explaining where I was going, saying things like 
“Yes, there are all-Black fraternities” and ignoring comments such as, “If it’s only for Black people, 
will they kick me out?” Some of the people around me were constantly curious about how they 
would be perceived if they dared enter an all-Black space, while they were insensitive to the fact 
that I spent a great amount of time being the only Black person in a room. I grew accustomed to 
laughing off hurtful comments that were meant to be funny, and quickly got sick of having to offer 
an explanation for my outside actions.

On other hand, when I did put myself into the Black community, I received very shocked 

responses to my Panhellenic involvement. People would ask me why I decided to join and, “How 
is it living with 60 white girls?” These conversations also made me uncomfortable — my choices 
were being judged. I understood that it was out of the norm for a Black girl to rush a Panhellenic 
sorority, but I did not understand why I was being criticized for it. It got to a point where I 
completely separated my sorority life from my Black life. I stopped mentioning my involvement 
in the sorority altogether. I was not at all embarrassed to be in my sorority, nor was I ashamed of 
all of my friends in the house, but for me it was easier to say, “No, I am not in a sorority” than to 
prepare for to the potential feedback of my Black peers.

This is when I began to realize, that for my own sake, it would be better if I was not tied to a 

Greek organization. I do not blame the system for why I felt this way; I blame myself for taking 
the easy way out by assimilating to a culture that wasn’t my own, rather than being bold enough 
to embrace my Blackness in a white space, or to embrace my sorority involvement in a Black space.

I made the decision to deactivate, completely disassociating myself from the sorority. Now, I feel 

comfortable going to events without being judged or questioned. I joined multiple organizations 
and found diverse groups of people on campus. I feel much more in touch with my own culture 
knowing that I have the freedom to express myself and my interests. Since leaving the sorority, 
my social life has done a complete 180. I am involved in both Black and white communities on 
campus, and I enjoy being in both environments. I still have my best friends from the sorority, who 
I love endlessly, and they are more than accepting of my lifestyle. Despite the negative stereotypes 
associated with Greek life, and despite my inability to find myself within the system, there are 
definitely positive aspects within the organization. Greek life allows you to get directly involved 
with philanthropy, which I loved. And I met wonderful people and sustained friendships that I 
wouldn’t have today if I hadn’t gone through the rush process.

With this being said, to any women of color considering rushing a Panhellenic sorority, here’s 

my advice to you:

I hope this piece does not deter you from rushing, but encourages you to stay confident through 

the process and keep a tight hold onto your culture.

Don’t settle for being accepted in one out of 16 (or however many) houses and don’t lose yourself 

through the process by assimilating into white communities.

Connect with the women of the houses that will appreciate all that you bring to the organization; 

don’t let contentedness overcome you.

And if people are oblivious to your background, have the strength to make them understand. 

It’s important to know how to teach others to love your culture, but that starts with you loving it 
first — don’t hide it.

Walk into a room and let people stare if they want to — because yes, you are a beautiful woman 

of color, and yes, they must deal with it.

Find a balance between engaging with your Greek community and connecting to the 

communities of color on campus. You should not feel like you need to keep these spaces separate, 
nor should you feel ashamed of one or the other.

Lastly, don’t let the perspectives and opinions of your sorority sisters deter you from connecting 

with your community. But don’t let the thoughts of your community of color convince you that 
being in a “white sorority” is wrong — you are powerful and smart enough to make your own 
decisions, including choosing to immerse yourself in multiple communities.

Questions and 
Misconceptions 

By Sarah Khan
Michigan in Color Editor

By Kayla Countryman, Michigan in Color Contributor


I 

felt like when people talked about people who looked 
like me, they were talking about villains. They were 
talking about criminals. They were talking about bur-

dens and deadweight. They were talking about deviants. 
After a certain point, I got confused if people were talking 
about my Blackness or my fatness. They started to blur.

Growing up being Black at a primarily white school, 

I navigated the associations, stereotypes and deeply 
ingrained biases and ignorance of my classmates, my 
instructors, the media, society and myself. I had been 
taught from an early age that to be successful meant to be 
different (read: not ‘Black’). I was taught to be ‘Black’ in 
white spaces was unprofessional and unbecoming. I need-
ed to have more respect for myself and that being ‘Black’ 
meant that you didn’t.

Despite the reality of being Black, I was constantly nav-

igating how to present myself in white spaces. This meant 
regulating my linguistic capabilities, dampening my cul-
tural connections and distinguishing myself as the ‘other’ 
with the ‘other’ in terms of my Blackness. It meant that in 
my efforts to assimilate to whiteness, whether conscious 
or unconscious, it had a direct impact on my place with-
in the Black community and influenced my authenticity 
within Blackness. While at the same time, the realness of 
being Black was on my mind as I constantly examined the 
ways it contrasted to whiteness and worked to erase them. 
My Blackness was doubted by everyone and without my 
Blackness, I was left to cling to the only thing I knew: that 
success meant being as white as I could.

They know that my body is not my own, but theirs. 

Every moment of everyday, people stare, they gawk. They 
clutch their purses. They cross the street. They leave me 
alone my bus seat. [COPY: on my bus seat?] They avoid my 
gaze. I am under their surveillance. They pretend I don’t 
exist. They make me smaller, erase me, erase my Black-
ness, even as I erase, lose pieces…pounds of myself.

The message was simple: Hate yourself.
In a society that does its best to capitalize on fat bod-

ies and Black bodies, why are Black skin and fat figures 
thought to be so worthless?

Fatness is the thing we love to hate, but hate to love. It 

is the imagined vessel of indulgence, and shame. It is the 
canvas where the thin erase their insecurities and paint 
blame and ridicule. Being fat meant constantly doubting 
my abilities because fatness is seen solely as a burden. A 
burden, most often, carried in silence by those who bear it. 
Don’t have fat friends, fat partners or fat children because 
they only make you look worse. Growing up, I was taught 
not to love my body, but instead, I was met with militant, 
cruel, and insistent ridicule. And those who do love peo-
ple who are fat, often, use their love as a means of convey-
ing the same message, because they were taught that to 
unconditionally love someone in their fatness, was not to 
love them at all, but to let them suffer. Fatness is thought 
to be a physical, social and moral disease. Fat people aren’t 
people at all, they simply the manifestation of a ‘problem’. 
You don’t get access to your full humanity and autonomy 
when you are fat. You become the recipient of everyone’s 
expectations and their criticism. You lost control of your-
self, because you realized that you were never meant to 
have it.

LOSE IT. YOU CAN DO IT. LOSE THE WEIGHT. 

LOSE YOUR HUMANITY. YOU ARE NOTHING. YOUR 
BODY IS EVERYTHING. YOUR FATNESS IS A LIMI-
TATION. YOUR BlackNESS IS A LIMITATION.

All you need to do is:
Hurt.
Be articulate.
Worry.
Count Your Calories.
Doubt Yourself.
Be Silent.
Hide yourself.
Black is Slimming.
Watch what you eat.
Watch what you say.
Watch how you dress.
Trying to figure out how to value my body for just exist-

ing.

Needing to figure out how to value my body for just 

existing.

Being fat means feeling unjustified.
Being Black means feeling unjustified.
Being fat means feeling unworthy
Being Black means feeling unworthy
Of investment. Of love. Of life.
Being Black means constantly having to navigate being 

unwanted and erased in spaces

Being fat means constantly having to navigate being 

unwanted and erased in spaces

Being Black means being in the way. Occupying space. 

Unnecessary. An excess.

Being fat means being in the way. All the time.
I was taught from a young age that my body was bad 

and that I needed to change to be better.

I was taught from a young age that my race was bad and 

I needed to change to be better.

I was taught that my body was a reflection of the person 

I was.

I was taught that my race was a reflection of the person 

I was.

I was responsible for being fat.
I was responsible for being Black.
To be fat is to be guilty.

To be Black is to be guilty.
My mind frequently wanders to Eric Garner.
Fatness tied as a noose for the destruction of Blackness.
“If I ever get that fat, please kill me”- A random strang-

er in conversation with her friend as they walk passed me

“You are killing yourself”- My grandfather once said, 

encouraging me to lose weight.

“Black-on-Black” crime.
To be fat is to die.
To be Black is to die.
You start to internalize these messages. They become a 

part of you until you wake up one day and realize that you 
have to actively fight against your own thoughts to love 
yourself. You have to redefine and reshape the definition 
of love and worth to face the world. You realize that you 
have to re-focus the gazes, the stares, the condemnations 
to messages of ignorance, the result of a system of oppres-
sion that was never meant to value your existence. You 
realize that to exist unapologetically is revolution (Thank 
you Lorde).

Fatness and Blackness.
Fat Blackness.
Black Fatness.
They are frameworks for the world. They are filters and 

pigments creating a kaleidoscope of experiences. Fatness 
and Blackness make us challenge the way we were taught 
to value and love life. My experiences as both Black per-
son and a fat person continue to shape the way I see the 
world. They have given me a capacity to love that is more 
than a finite measure of the color of my skin or the cir-
cumference of a waistline. They have made me aware of 
the ways in which we continue to marginalize and wound 
those around us. Wound ourselves.

How do you justify violence?
In the name of health?
In the name of love?
In the name of respectability?
Who determines the value of life?
What authority do you have?
Who gave it to you?
Because I didn’t.
I won’t.

I Can’t Breathe: 
To be Fat and Black

A

s a child, I was taught that love casts out all fear

Fear of difference, of embracing those unlike 

me

Unconditional love does not see with the eyes much 

like we do

Rather it sees with the heart
In this way, we are able to go to new places, meet new 

people, and not judge or make assumptions

I went to India this past summer, with an open mind 

and open heart

Although it was specified as a “service-learning” trip, 

I definitely was able to learn and take away more than 
what I was able to do in the community

I saw some of the strengths, beauties, and limitations 

of humanity

The saddening still existing misconception that the 

only face of America is a Caucasian male or female with 
blond, straight hair and blue eyes

When asked where I was from?
“America” was not an appropriate answer
More like Africa, West Indies, or Bangalore
But I could not accept or deny these guesses of my ori-

gin

For I have no specific knowledge of my ancestors
My social identities were brought to the forefront
And my privilege made more apparent
The question of “who am I?” was challenged daily
But I discovered more and more as the days went by
As pieces of myself were revealed, I saw the face of 

humanity in a new light

I began to see what it means to be a community, to 

work towards a common goal with strangers who quick-
ly became friends

An experience that crossed often untouched territo-

ries of working together regardless of language barriers, 
class, nationality, skin color, or religious and spiritual 
difference

I had found a place where I could be authentically me
When I came home and reflected I was enthralled by 

what I had discovered

Who am I?
I think that is a question many of us have asked our-

selves at one point in our lives.

Who Am I? What makes me, me?
Yes, I am a Black American, working class, heterosex-

ual woman, who is a first generation college student

I pray to God, who I believe helps write the script of 

my story, my life

I come from a people that have time and time again 

been ignored, misunderstood, victimized, and scruti-
nized, yet always still they rise

But really, who am I?
Am I only the mere things that people can see?
My dark skin, textured hair, or my wallet and pockets 

with little money?

Am I not ambitious, strong, confident, motivated, and 

talented?

Am I not hard working, caring, nurturing, and com-

passionate?

Who am I, really?
I am not merely one of these things but a mixture of 

it all

And although life has its struggles, I am not willing to 

tumble and fall

I am not the color of my skin or the value of my income 

but rather what I do being a Black person of low SES

These traits which are a major part of my identity and 

life do not completely define me

They are merely intricate pieces to a puzzle that fit 

together to create who I am and who I choose to be

But what about those things that people cannot see?
My passion for working with children, singing, danc-

ing and being carefree?

Are these things not also a part of me?
I take pride in my ethnic history, family traditions, and 

interests

My love for music, mathematics, family outings, and 

counseling close friends

But there is so much about me that can only be seen 

internally

If I were a looking glass, you could see every part of me 

but yet all you see is one side of me…rather all you choose 
to see is one side of me

Either my skin complexion, my Bible I carry, the less 

fancy clothes I wear, my vernacular or slang

But I understand that you may not comprehend that 

even though we may look the same or even totally differ-
ent, we all can relate to this

This question of “who am I?”
Like the iceberg effect, we are more than what people 

can see on the surface

There is so much hidden beneath waiting to be seen
Just take the moment and look a little deeper and you 

will be surprised by what you see

When I did this, I found the real me
I realized no matter what people say to discriminate, 

to separate

We are all not that different
We are all the same in that we are
Human…
I bleed red, you bleed red, we both cry, we laugh, we 

have ups, we have downs

So, when asked, “who am I?”
I can say…
I am Sharae, a young woman trying to leave a mark in 

the world just as my culture and identity has left a mark 
on my heart that always reminds me to never be afraid 
to just be me
