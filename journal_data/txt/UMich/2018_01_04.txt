The Interfraternity Council 

at the University of Michigan 
will begin to restore social 
event privileges to fraternities 
this 
semester, 
according 

to a statement released on 
the 
organization’s 
website 

Wednesday 
morning. 
The 

announcement comes after a 
two-month self-imposed ban. 
Recruitment this semester for 
the IFC fraternities will continue 
as scheduled. 

“IFC will begin a phased 

process 
of 
restoring 
social 

event privileges on January 3, 
2018,” the statement read. “This 
process will not constitute an 

immediate lift of the social 
suspension for all IFC chapters. 
The phased process will involve 
chapters 
being 
notified 
of 

specific action plans they will 
need to complete.”

 As early as Tuesday evening, 

The 
Daily 
obtained 
copies 

of invitations to IFC chapter 
mixers 
sent 
to 
Panhellenic 

sorority members who requested 
to remain anonymous.

At the IFC’s meeting on Nov. 9, 

presidents of several University 
fraternities voted to suspend all 
social activities and pledge terms 
following allegations of sexual 
assault and hazing during the 
previous months. 

The 
Inglis 
House, 
which 

was once used by University 
administration to accommodate 
overnight guests such as the 
Dalai Lama and President Gerald 
Ford, has been sold to buyers who 
intend to use the property as a 
family residence.

In 
1950, 
Elizabeth 
Inglis 

donated the property to the 
University after the death of 
her husband James Inglis, who 
stipulated that the property 
would be given to the University 
as a residence for the University’s 
president. However, Elizabeth 
delivered a quitclaim deed to the 
Board of Regents in 1951 as former 
University presidents have opted 
for the more centrally situated 
property of 815 S. University 
Ave., the traditional home for 
presidents of the University since 
its inaugural president, Henry 
Tappan.

James 
Kosteva, 
University 

director of community relations, 
explained the house has not 
been used since 2012 and would 
continue to incur significant 
maintenance costs in addition to 
the cost of necessary renovations.

“It 
determined 
that 
the 

University would need to spend 
a minimum of $4.7 million 
of capital to make the home 
usable and would need to fund 
approximately 
$550,000 
on 

(an) annual basis to operate the 
property,” Kosteva wrote in an 
email interview. “The University 

administration determined that 
the long-term costs of property 
exceed the benefit to be derived 
and that operation of the property 
was not mission critical.”

The University administration 

recommended 
selling 
the 

property, and the Board of 
Regents approved the sale at a 
meeting in March. The board 
decided to use proceeds from 
the sale to establish a new 
scholarship for students in the 

Inglis family name.

At an April regents meeting, 

community 
members 
and 

members of the Inglis family 
expressed grave concern over the 
sale of the property. Esther Kyke, 
a member of the Inglis family, 
worried 
new 
owners 
could 

demonlish the home now that it 
was no longer under University 
protection. Kyke and a dozen 
other members of the Inglis 
family presented the regents 

with a letter condemning the sale 
of the home. 

“It has also come to the 

collective attention of the Inglis 
family that it has been publicly 
circulated that we are very 
pleased with this decision and 
that the living relatives approve 
of the sale,” Kyke read in April. 

Students on campus are used to 

hailing a ride with Uber, but now 
they can order a snack or meal 
with the company as well. Uber is 
expanding its presence in Ann Arbor 
with the launch of UberEATS, a new 
food delivery system featuring Uber 
drivers as the deliverers.

The phone application launched 

on Dec. 7 and will connect Ann 
Arbor residents to 27 different local 
restaurants. While in Michigan the 
food delivery system is currently 
only 
operating 
in 
downtown 

Ann Arbor, Kerrytown and the 
University of Michigan campus, 
UberEATS has the potential to 
expand even farther.

Liz 
Meyerdirk, 
UberEATS 

Head of Development, said more 
restaurants are learning about 
UberEATS and seeking to get 
involved themselves.

“After launching, we work to 

understand what customers want 
by surveying and understanding 
what their behavior is like through 
the app,” Meyerdirk said.

Graduate employee union requests leave during Spencer visit, release inclusion guidelines

After 
contentious 
contract 

bargaining 
last 
winter, 
the 

University of Michigan Graduate 
Employees’ Union has focused 

much of its efforts on equity across 
its membership of more than 1,800 
graduate 
student 
instructors, 

research 
assistants 
and 
staff 

members. Last year’s contract 
hinged upon the hiring of graduate 
student assistants working solely 
on execution of the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan. In the 
new year, GEO looks towards 

issues of race and class, both inside 
and outside of the classroom. 

The Michigan Daily spoke with 

GEO president Rachel Miller, 
a Rackham student, to discuss 
initiatives 
including 
inclusive 

teaching, and whether or not 
GEO members will be on campus 
during a potential visit from white 
supremacist Richard Spencer.

Inclusive Teaching Network 

Releases Guide for Instructors

GEO released a statement on 

its Facebook page Tuesday night 
encouraging their members to 
look into new resources from 
the Inclusive Teaching Network 
and implement them into their 
classrooms.

In 1980, LSA held its first 

Theme Semester at the University 
of Michigan in hopes of providing 
students with the opportunity 
to immerse themselves in a 
specific topic through classes 
and extracurricular events such 
as museum exhibits and theater 
performances. 

Past topics have covered a 

broad range of subjects from 
“Water” in Winter 2011 to “The 
Possible Futures of U-M” in Fall 
2017, themes selected through 
the Office of the Associate Dean 
for Undergraduate Education.

However, following a busy 

year 
with 
the 
University’s 

Bicentennial, there is no theme 
this semester.

“We do not have a theme 

semester every semester, or 
even every year; the frequency 
depends on the number of 
proposals we received at any 
given time,” Angela Dillard, 
LSA 
Associate 
Dean 
for 

Undergraduate Education, wrote 
in an email interview.

“Whether these ideas are new 

to you or you’re very familiar with 
inclusive teaching, we encourage 
you to share these documents 
widely!” the post read.

The 
Inclusive 
Teaching 

Network, 
a 
new 
University 

group 
comprised 
of 
faculty, 

graduate students and activists, 
works to make classrooms more 
supportive 
for 
marginalized 

students. In the wake of a spate of 
racist attacks and bias incidents 
on campus in the last two years, 
many students have decried 
professsors’ lacking engagement 
in the classroom. 

“We aim to promote a culture 

of accountability in upholding 
our commitments to practicing 
anti-racist, 
anti-queerphobic, 

accessible, and radically inclusive 
pedagogies,” 
the 
group’s 

Facebook page reads.

While the Inclusive Teaching 

Network 
had 
not 
yet 

responded to interview requests 
at the time of publication, the 
ITN 
teaching 
guidelines—a 

document shared on the GEO 
Facebook page—included advice 
on handling and preventing 
issues that might come up before 
the first day of, and throughout 
the semester. 

“An inclusive classroom is 

cultivated over time by taking 
regular, deliberate steps towards 
creating equitable access for all 
students to meet high standards 
for learning,” the document 
states. “This doesn’t mean you 
have to know everything about 
what is ‘correct’ for working with 
different identity groups. Rather, 
true inclusivity means working 
to understand and provide for 
the real learning needs of all 
individuals in the room.”

The 
document 
highlights 

the Center for Research on 
Learning 
and 
Teaching 
as 

another important source for 
instructors interested in learning 
more about inclusive teaching. 

Indeed, Theresa Braunschneider, 
associate 
director 
and 

coordinator 
of 
diversity 

initiatives at the CRLT, said the 
center has prioritized promoting 
inclusivity in the classroom over 
the last few years. 

“We 
know 
that 
students’ 

feelings 
of 
recognition 
and 

belonging are strongly correlated 
to 
their 
ability 
to 
learn,” 

Braunschneider wrote to The 
Daily in an email interview. 
“When 
we 
define 
inclusive 

teaching at CRLT, we emphasize 
the importance of all students 
feeling valued and respected and 
the ways that systemic inequities 
(such 
as 
racism, 
sexism, 

wealth inequity) and patterns 
of bias (such as homophobia, 
Islamophobia, xenophobia, etc.) 
create disparate experiences for 
different students.”

Students 
have 
complained 

classroom biases—across colleges 
and departments on campus—can 
disrupt learning. Last summer, 
Engineering graduate student 
Aeriel Murphy recounted sexist 

comments by her professors. 

“It wasn’t until I was 

an undergrad that it really 
started to affect me,” Murphy 
said. “My senior year of 
college, I had a professor 
say to the class, ‘don’t let the 
women be in the same group 
together 
because 
women 

have a hard time getting 
things done.’” 

In the past, the CRLT 

has focused on supporting 
teachers through the process 
of making their classrooms 
into 
more 
equitable 

environments. Most of this 
work has been done through 
workshops, both embedded 
in departments and open 
to any faculty. The CRLT 
also works with Liaisons 
for Inclusive Teaching from 
each of the University’s 19 
schools to help them develop 
school-specific programs.

Graduate 
Student 

Instructor 
programs 
also 

exist, 
and 
according 
to 

Braunschneider, all GSIs who 
attend the CRLT’s teaching 
orientations at the beginning 
of the term — about 800 

every 
year 
— 
are 
offered 

inclusivity training. Beyond that, 
many departments require GSIs 
to take a pedagogy course, often 
in collaboration with the CRLT. 
Though the resources created by 
the Inclusive Teaching Network 
are not explicitly related to 
the 
CRLT, 
Braunschneider 

explained many of the ideas in 
the document came from CRLT 
workshops, and some of the 
people involved in the materials’ 
creation work for them as GSI 
consultants.

Though inclusive teaching has 

been a priority of the CRLT for 
many years now, Braunschneider 
said the University community 
has recently begun to take it 
more seriously.

“Partly inspired by student 

activism, partly prompted by DEI 
strategic planning efforts led by 
the University administration, 
and partly in response to an 
increasingly hostile climate for 
people of many identities both on 
our campus and more broadly in 
our country, we’ve seen a huge 
increase in recent years in faculty 
commitment to and interest in 
learning about inclusive teaching 
— across all disciplines,” she 
wrote. 
“We’re 
really 
busy, 

and that’s a good thing! ... We 
regularly revisit how we frame 
inclusive teaching and prepare 
instructors across many fields to 
teach inclusively, so our materials 
dynamically evolve in relation to 
the work we’re doing with faculty 
and GSIs.”

GEO negotiates not working 

the day of potential Spencer visit

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization 
is 
working 
to 

excuse 
graduate 
student 

employees from a working day 
if Spencer, an avowed white 
nationalist, speaks on campus. 
The specific day he will visit is 
still undecided, though Spencer’s 
lawyers have requested space 
during spring break. Spencer’s 
lawyers set a deadline of Jan. 15 
for the University to determine 
a date, though administrators’ 
negotiations 
remain 
largely 

under wraps.

As a child, I used to think 

about the stories and poems 
I wanted to write when I got 
older. 
Whenever 
something 

funny happened, I thought 
of how I could write a story 
about it and make someone 
else laugh too. Yet, I never 
actually put pen to paper. 
The stories I wanted to write 
 

were 
so 
different 
from 

the books I read, and my 
experiences were so noticeably 
different from those of my 
favorite characters. I thought 
my story wasn’t something 
people 
cared 
about. 
Why 

would anyone want to know 
what an Indian, Muslim girl 
from Michigan thought?

It wasn’t until I learned 

about 
the 
erasure 
of 
my 

history that I realized how 
powerful 
stories 
could 
be. 

As I began engaging with 
social justice, and learning 
 

names for phenomena that I 
had noticed and experienced 
as a kid, I realized that my 
stories had power. The details 
of my life are as important as 
Jo March’s in “Little Women.” 
My talents are as magical as 
Matilda’s. My feelings are as 
important as Hermione’s.

I didn’t write much as a 

child because I was scared. 

I was scared no one would 
like what I wrote, and I was 
scared no one would even care. 
As I grew older and pushed 
myself to write about my lived 
experiences, I found people 
who had experiences similar to 
my own. Finding other people 
who relate to what I have 
been through is empowering. 
 

This is what pushed me to 
write more and eventually join 
MiC.

MiC 
is 
a 
space 
where 

people of color can share their 
thoughts 
without 
policing 

their 
writing 
to 
fit 
what 

society tells us is important. 
We — our most raw and 
 

true selves — are important. We 
belong here. Most importantly, 
we deserve a space to share 
our stories. For me, MiC is that 
space and I hope it can be as 
empowering of a platform for 
more people of color as well.

I spent my whole childhood 

defining 
my 
Blackness 
with 

words that were not mine for 
the choosing. My peers defined 
Blackness by hip-hop, poverty 
and a certain accent, and when 
I didn’t fit their stereotype, I 
was flippantly called an Oreo. 
My parents did what they could 
to give me a solid foundation in 
my identity, but when half of my 
day was spent around people 
who looked nothing like me, 

there’s only so much they could 
do. I was left feeling irrevocably 
inadequate; not Black enough to 
truly be Black. My self-confidence 
ached in the deepest of ways, 
unable to overcome such a deep-
rooted feeling of confusion and 
disconnection. 
My 
Blackness 

was silenced, and worse, I didn’t 
necessarily believe that was a bad 
thing.

It wasn’t until I was exposed 

to the written works of women 
of color that I began to fathom a 
version of self-acceptance that 
was previously denied to me. 
Proponents of radical self-love — 

such as Audre Lorde, Rupi Kaur, 
Michelle Obama and bell hooks 
— were the role models I didn’t 
know I needed. They taught me 
the necessity of unconditionally 
accepting who I am, and that 
includes the histories, experiences 
and 
uniqueness 
inherent 
in 

my identities. And now, I can 
breathe a little bit easier knowing 
I have the agency to define my 
 

Blackness how I please, and I have 
the agency to live out my truth 
unforgivingly. 

Too often the experiences 

of people of color are placed 
into 
hollow 
molds 
that 

condense 
narratives 
into 
a 

single 
experience, 
one 
that 

is 
frequently 
stereotaypical, 

distorted 
and 
derogatory. 

These misconstrued stories not 
only cause misunderstandings 
between communities, but they 
cause internal alienation and 
dissonance 
when 
one’s 
own 

experience does not match up 
with the dominant narrative. I 
experienced this firsthand, and all 
of this could have been avoided if 
the individual narratives of people 
of color were valued in their 
entirety and individuality. 

Michigan in Color is the 

platform I have been seeking 
to affirm the individual lived 
experience of people of color. As I 
work daily to build the confidence 
in my own voice, MiC is dedicated 
to projecting voices that have been 
historically and systematically 
muted. Through my time in MiC, 
I will hope to not only form the 
words of my own story, but to 
unconditionally 
affirm 
others 

in the search for their own. I 
welcome the mutual vulnerability, 
growth and power that will arise 
from such an energetic space.

I am so bad at expressing 

myself. Oh my gosh, you guys, I 
am so bad at expressing myself.

I can pump out boring, 

essay-like pages in a quick 
second; they won’t be perfect, 
but they’ll be readable. They’ll 
make sense. But putting my 
feelings 
and 
thoughts 
into 

coherent words is just an 
entirely different journey, and 
the thought of doing that on 
a regular basis this semester 
makes my skin crawl with 
uneasy, jumpy nerves.

But I want to.
(I 
am 
already 
halfway 

regretting writing this but 
I’ll soldier on in the most self-
deprecating way possible.)

Having followed Michigan 

in Color, the corner desk of The 
Michigan Daily, for a long time, 
I have seen talented, intelligent 
writers draft up the most 
wonderful pieces. The thought-
provoking, heavy and nuanced 
discussions 
have 
genuinely 

prompted me to examine the 
way I wanted to present myself 
in the world.

My 
relationship 
to 
my 

identity has been a paradox 
of stubborn belief in who I 

am mixed in with a shit-ton 
of insecurities. The stubborn 
belief part came a little late. 
My life story goes: Born in 
the United States, spent years 
abroad living in four countries, 
came back to the U.S. for high 
school and steadily becoming 
hyper-aware of my capital O, 
quotation marks “Otherness.”

I 
think 
we 
all 
have 
a 

complicated relationship with 
who we are. I think it’s a mess 
of emotions and deep thought. I 
think a lot about how I present 
myself, the ways I suppress 
myself, the ways people see 
me, my culture, my language, 
my home life, my strained 

relationship with my kind-of 
hometown Lahore, Pakistan. I 
think, in the U.S., it’s hard to 
pin yourself down and make 
yourself a place because the 
ground beneath you is always 
shifting and rejecting parts of 
you. But I think that MiC is a 
pretty great place to be around 
others who might feel the same. 
We can be unsure together.

In the future, I want to do 

this whole journalism thing — 
for better or for worse, against 
all family wishes because they 
are pretty brown. But, I am 
not cut out for three years of 
law school, sorry Mom! And 
to do that, it is so important, 
vital, necessary, to read as 
many narratives as possible — 
to know all of the corners of 
the story, the whole picture. It 
is so important in journalism 
to represent people and their 
identities as responsibly as 
possible. It is up to the writers 
to train themselves. I want 
to help bring stories to the 
spotlight. I want to make sure 
that race isn’t just an angle for 
someone to take, but a voice 
seamlessly 
woven 
into 
the 

account. 

I am beyond excited and 

honored to be heading over to 
Michigan in Color. There is so 
much we could be talking about 
— so much. I can’t wait to be a 
part of that discussion. I can’t 
wait to help cultivate and open 
that discussion. Oh my gosh, 
you guys, I can’t wait.

“Your hair, it is so…” fill 

in the blank: “fluffy,” “big,” 
“weird,” you name it. People 
said these things to me while 
they ran their hands through 
my hair as I walked to my 
history class. They were not 
used to the natural hair of a 
Black girl who always wore 
her hair slicked down and 
straightened. Needless to say, 

I never did it again. It took 
too much time out of my day 
running to the bathroom in 
between classes to tame the 
frizz that had occurred in 
my twist-out because people 
continued to touch my hair 
without my permission. This 
was my life for 12 years at a 
predominantly white Catholic 
school in Ann Arbor.

Being 
Black 
was 
not 

necessarily something I was 
proud of growing up because 
I was different from everyone 

else, and it is not easy to 
embrace something when no 
one is else similar is around 
you. To me, being a part of 
Michigan in Color is a way 
to not only get to know more 
about myself and my Blackness 
relative to the world around 
me, but to get to know other 
people of color who may have 
experiences similar to mine. I 
love being able to connect with 
people over storytelling and 
I think that MiC gives me the 
perfect opportunity to do just 
that, even if it makes just one 
person on this campus feel like 
they have a community that 
supports them. Becoming a 
part of MiC allows for different 
perspectives to form and new 
relationships between people 
of color on campus to develop, 
and in this turbulent time 
period, that is what is needed 
most.

 There is power in 

storytelling 
and 
sharing 

our experiences with other 
people, and I think Michigan 
in Color is a perfect platform 
to ameliorate the voices of 
those that need to be heard 
the most. I have already seen 
the 
growth 
that 
so 
many 

contributors have had during 
their time at MiC, like Adam 
who was vulnerable about his 
personal growth since joining 
Michigan in Color. Knowing 
his experience gives me hope. I 
am but one person, but I know 
that my passion to learn about 
the experiences of people of 
color, as well as sharing my 
own, is what is going to make 
the biggest difference of all.

I’ve 
always 
known 
that 

Michigan in Color is a space 
to reclaim narratives and an 
opportunity to be vulnerable 
yet subversive. That is why 
I joined in the first place; 
however, I’ve come to realize 
that Michigan in Color is more 
than a publication space. To 
me, Michigan in Color is a 
community.

Over the past years, I’ve been 

so honored to work with some 
of the most incredible writers, 
activists and dearest friends. 
There was De’Mario and Toni 
who led me my first year, and 
Alyssa, Ashley and Sabrina who 
inspired me to speak louder as a 
Filipino American. Then Ashley 
and Jason took over my second 
year to lead Adam, Areeba, 
Halimat, Neel, Sivanthy, Tanya 
and I. As a senior editor and 
summer managing editor, I’ve 
had the privilege of reading 
and editing so many important 
stories from amazing people.

Michigan 
in 
Color 
has 

given me so much direction in 
my life. I’m forever grateful 
for all the late nights at the 
office, brunches and editorial 
photoshoots. 
Though 
there 

were fun times filled with 
sugary coffee and banter, the 
more serious moments were 
lessons for me to grow. Though 
speaking out isn’t always easy, 
I’ve come to acknowledge and 
use the privilege I have to 
help uplift others who are not 
immediately afforded the same 
luxury.

I cannot thank my former 

editors enough for being in 
my life during my highest 
of highs and lowest of lows. 
They are truly the friends that 

have encouraged me to pursue 
my creative endeavors. I’ve 
learned so much about myself 
as a person of color and the 
importance of storytelling to 
both myself and others.

As 
my 
third 
year 
with 

Michigan 
in 
Color 
comes 

around, I cannot help but 
be excited to expand this 
community. 
There 
are 
so 

many thoughts that must be 
expressed and so many voices 
that need to be heard. As I have 
been supported to speak louder, 
I want to continue to do the 
same for other people of color 
on campus by passing on the 
MiC.

Though there 
were fun times 
filled with sug-
ary coffee and 

banter, the 
more serious 
moments were 
lessons for me 

to grow. 


“W

e 
have 
an 

opportunity 
to rebuild the 

financial system,” Galia Benartzi, 
technology 
entrepreneur 
at 

cryptocurrency protocol Bancor, 
said to Fortune in December. 
“Are we going to do it with all 
guys again?”

To the average follower of the 

Bitcoin fad, Benartzi’s comment 
may appear blindly optimistic. 
Blockchain is a relatively new 
technology that allows for digital 
interactions that don’t require a 
third party — think a Google Doc 
that everyone has access to edit in 
real time, but without a third party 
like Google to oversee it. Though 
this may sound fairly simple, 
there are several tech companies 
aiming to use blockchain to 
reinvent media, charity and, of 
course, money. Bitcoin was the 
first major form of cryptocurrency 
built on blockchain technology. If 
people recognize it as money, it 
will allow for a financial system 
with no third parties. That means 
no banks, no Federal Reserve and 
likely no taxes.

However, at this point, few 

people are buying into the hype. It 
would be somewhat naive to claim 
that Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency 
in general, could rebuild the 
financial system any time soon. It’s 
even more naive to act as though 
it’s the feminists’ chance to finally 
take down the patriarchy. Rather, 
according to many economists, 
cryptocurrencies are expected 
to lose almost all value in a burst 
similar to that of the dot-com 
bubble in 2001.

Why? The economic definition 

of money is a medium of exchange 
and a store of value. As people 
invest 
in 
cryptocurrency 

speculatively, its prices are driven 
artificially high at extremely 
fast 
rates. 
The 
volatility 
of 

cryptocurrency 
compromises 

its trustworthiness as a store of 
value, and therefore gives it very 
little potential to be implemented 
as a medium of exchange in 
everyday life. In order to avoid 
a cryptocurrency bubble burst, 
cryptocurrency must be given 
some sort of intrinsic value, or 
at least perceived value. Because 
paper 
money 
provides 
the 

marketplace with an established 
system 
and 
relatively 
steady 

exchange rates, it’s difficult to 
envision a large-scale switch 
to 
cryptocurrency. 
Therefore, 

avoiding 
the 
burst 
of 
the 

cryptocurrency 
bubble 
would 

entail major innovation: some 
sort of creative thinking that 
encourages the average spender 
to exchange his or her money for 
cryptocurrency for reasons other 
than speculation.

Whether or not she intended 

to 
do 
so, 
Benartzi 
actually 

acknowledged the risk of a Bitcoin 
bubble in her comment. If women 
and minority groups enter the 
cryptocurrency 
industry 
both 

by claiming leadership roles in 
companies that center around 
cryptocurrency, or simply by 
investing in cryptocurrency, this 
could turn cryptocurrency from 
a fad to a legitimate financial 
system. In essence, if we “do it 
with all guys again,” we will not 
rebuild the financial system, and 
the bubble will likely pop. But, 
if we diversify the crypto-
world, cryptocurrency has a 
chance of surviving.

Why 
might 
diversity 
give 

cryptocurrency the chance to 
survive? According to Forbes, 

somewhere between 5 and 7 
percent of all cryptocurrency users 
are women. As one can imagine, as 
we look at the leadership positions 
of companies centered around 
cryptocurrency, the percentage 
of women decreases even more. 
Marketplace trends make it clear 
that industries with relatively 
homogenous leadership do not fare 
well when it comes to innovation.

There is no shortage of data 

supporting this claim. According 
to McKinsey’s report Diversity 
Matters, “companies in the top 
quartile for gender diversity are 
15 percent more likely to have 
financial returns above their 
respective 
national 
industry 

medians,” while “bottom quartile 
companies are lagging rather 
than merely not leading.” It 
claims “diversity is a competitive 
differentiator 
shifting 
market 

share 
toward 
more 
diverse 

companies.” 
As 
Scientific 

American 
puts 
it, 
“Decades 

of research by organizational 
scientists, 
psychologists, 

sociologists, 
economists 
and 

demographers 
show 
that 

socially diverse groups (that is, 
those with a diversity of race, 
ethnicity, gender and sexual 
orientation) are more innovative 
than homogeneous groups.”

If anyone is in desperate and 

immediate need of innovation, it 
is the cryptocurrency industry. 
They need to beat the clock, to find 
a way to establish cryptocurrency 

as a legitimate store of value before 
the bubble bursts. Therefore, 
the importance of women being 
involved in blockchain at every 
level is not some feminist fantasy. 
Rather, it is critical to the success 
of cryptocurrency.

In areas where women are 

involved 
in 
cryptocurrency, 

especially in leadership positions, 
we have seen unprecedented 
levels of innovation. According 
to 
Fortune, 
female-led 

cryptocurrency companies focus 
on different issues than those 
led by men. For example, female-
led BitPesa and Tala are using 
blockchain technology to provide 
basic 
financial 
services, 
like 

insurance and access to credit, to 
parts of the world in which these 
services aren’t easily accessible. In 
her article for Coindesk, Thessy 
Mehrain, founder of Women 
in Blockchain, outlined what 
she believes should be goals for 
blockchain use 2018. These goals 
included self-regulation of the 
cryptocurrency and the ability 
to “enable the core promises of 
blockchain to empower human 
rights.” 
These 
goals 
differ 

significantly from the traditional 
goals of male leaders in the 
blockchain community, and are, 
by definition, innovative.

The 
increased 
innovation 

that comes with more diverse 
leadership 
is 
exactly 
what 

cryptocurrency needs to avoid 
a bubble burst. As it stands, 
cryptocurrency is viewed, at 
best, as a decentralized monetary 
system that’s effective for avoiding 
taxes or getting paid without a 
social security number. At worst, 
it is viewed as a fun speculative 
investment that will likely lose 
all value in the coming years. The 
innovations we have seen from 
female-led companies provide an 
entirely new range of applications 
for cryptocurrency with a larger 
user base. This means, with 
enough creative thinking, it still 
stands a chance of meeting the 
definition of money.

Of 
course, 
women 
aren’t 

magical fairy godmothers who 
will 
magically 
prevent 
the 

burst of the Bitcoin bubble. The 
magical 
fairy 
godmother 
is 

simply innovation itself. However, 
marketplace trends have shown 
time and time again that diversity 
is one of the biggest indicators of 
innovation. This means that as 
cryptocurrency 
works 
against 

the clock to find a way to establish 
itself as legitimate currency before 
the bubble bursts, it is highly 
advisable for executives in the 
cryptocurrency industry to do 
everything they can to increase 
diversity in their companies.

“G

et out there, get 
in the way, get in 
trouble, good trouble, 

necessary trouble and make some 
noise,” U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., 
said at the Massachusetts College 
of Liberal Arts. CNN anchor 
Jake Tapper chose simpler, more 
practical advice at Dartmouth 
College: “Always write thank-you 
notes. Be a big tipper. Always split 
Aces and Eights. Floss.” Perhaps 
my favorite of the many memorable 
quotes from college commencement 
speeches in 2017 came from actress 
Helen Mirren, who reminded the 
2017 graduates at Tulane University 
that “Like a hangover, neither 
triumph nor disaster lasts forever.” 

All across the country, graduates 

and their parents heard from titans 
of industry, politicians, comedians, 
authors 
and 
people 
whose 

stories provided perspective and 
inspiration for their transition from 
undergraduate life into the “real 
world.” Not so at the University 
of Michigan. The 2017 graduating 
class will no doubt struggle to 
remember 
anything 
notable 

about the video and multimedia 
presentation they watched last 
April, in honor of the Bicentennial.

Considering the backlash that 

radiated from these events last 
year, I doubt very much that the 
University’s 2018 graduating class 
will see a repeat of this error in 
judgement. We can expect, at the 
very least, a speaker. Rather than 
wait, though, for the administration 
to make a choice that may be 
phenomenally 
underwhelming, 

why not take the reins on this one?

Our class has spent a unique four 

years in Ann Arbor. Punctuated 
for many by the 2016 presidential 
election, we have seen countless 
changes in University policy and 
culture, including the unveiling of 
the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic plan, the decline of Greek 
life and substantial increases in 
housing costs and tuition. We 
cracked the discussion wide-open 
in reference to free speech on 

college campuses, and continue to 
debate the implications of Richard 
Spencer coming to campus. On the 
global stage, our four years saw 
refugee crises in the Middle East 
and Europe, a nuclear deal with 
Iran, the rise of nationalism across 
Western democracies and data 
leaks that rocked the world.

To put it another way, it has been 

an 
extraordinarily 
interesting 

four years to be a college student. 
Accordingly, to compose and 
deliver an appropriate speech — 
be it inspirational, controversial, 
comedic or anything in between — 
will be quite the challenge. What 
better search committee than 
those of us who discussed these 
events in classes and dining halls, 
and who have an idea of what tone 
we would like to capture?

Student-led 
searches 
for 

commencement speakers are 
not at all out of the ordinary. 
Just last year, the student body 
at Rutgers University succeeded 
in bringing President Barack 
Obama 
to 
their 
graduation 

ceremony. 
“Emails, 
letters, 

tweets, YouTube videos – I 
even got three notes from the 
grandmother of your student 
body president,” Obama said. “I 
have to say, that really sealed the 
deal.” In 2014, it was a student-
led campaign at the University 
of California at Irvine that 
chose to hear from President 
Obama as well.

At 
Manhattanville 
College, 

student government works in 
tandem 
with 
administrators 

to “create a list of potential 
speakers.” At Dillard University, 
each graduating senior submits a 
list of 10 personalities from which 
they would like to hear. Though 
such processes would obviously 
be a logistical nightmare at 
a university as large as ours, 
these examples provide a stark 
contrast with recent incidents 
of student protest in relation to 
commencement speakers.

Such incidents include, but 

are not limited to, recent events 
such as the selection of Secretary 
of Education Betsy DeVos at 
Baltimore University and Vice 
President Mike Pence at the 
University of Notre Dame. Each 
speaker sparked their fair share 
of outrage among the student 
body. Regardless of whether or 
not you agree with their protests, 
no one can deny many students 
were greatly upset with their 
university’s decision. Just a few 
years earlier, former Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice had to 
decline an invitation to speak at 
Rutgers University based on the 
student body’s distaste for her 
record in favor of the Iraq War and 
as a supporter of torture.

Clearly, there are two ways of 

going about this selection process. 
One involves a lot of tension, 
long-winded Facebook posts and 
protests. The other involves a little 
bit of effort, a lot of student input 
and the satisfaction of all parties 
knowing that the decision is 
shared by thousands of members 
of the target audience rather than 
a group of administrators offering 
their best guess of what will go 
over well.

The right person for the job 

might be John Lewis, Jake 
Tapper or Helen Mirren. It 
might 
be 
an 
entrepreneur, 

an actor, a politician or an 
academic. My personal wish 
list includes Stephen Colbert 
and Michelle Obama. Whoever 
it is, as a member of the 2018 
graduating class, I would like to 
hear from someone we picked on 
graduation day.

Whether it be The Michigan 

Daily or the Central Student 
Government or the University 
administration who gets the ball 
rolling, the discussion should start 
now. Not that any of us need the 
reminder, but April is right around 
the corner.

Choosing our commencement speaker

I

n 
the 
months 
since 

President Donald Trump’s 
inauguration, 
various 

policy decisions and comments 
by the nation’s leader have called 
into question the country’s status 
as a role model for democracy. 
Through big legislation proposals 
in the areas of immigration and tax 
code, it has become evident that 
the power structure of the United 
States is slowly shifting to favor 
the privileged and neglect those 
without a voice.

But this power controversy 

throughout Trump’s term is not 
limited to hypersensitive topics 
like immigration and health care 
alone — it has manifested itself in 
seemingly insignificant laws that 
have fairly pertinent consequences.

On 
Dec. 
14, 
the 
Federal 

Communications 
Commission 

voted 
to 
overturn 
the 
2015 

regulations put in place by President 
Barack Obama that mandated net 
neutrality across the internet.

In what Ajit Pai, Trump-

appointed 
chairman 
of 
the 

U.S. 
Federal 
Communications 

Commission, called an attempt 
to stop the government from 
“micromanaging the internet,” the 
repeal on regulations gives internet 
service 
providers 
significantly 

more power over what is available 
and for what price on the web, 
potentially hampering the current 
freedom consumers have to surf 
the internet.

Only two days later, reports 

surfaced 
that 
Trump 
had 

informed the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention of a 
supposed banned word list for 
official documents in the 2019 
fiscal year, including pressing 
terms like “diversity,” “science-
based” and “transgender.”

Though 
the 
validity 
of 

the report remains a topic of 
conversation, 
the 
fact 
that 

such allegations would surface 
from a CDC official speaks to 
the dangerous direction the 
country is headed in terms of 
censorship and the relationship 
between the government and 
the media. The net neutrality 
and CDC policies both highlight 
Trump’s desire to take the 
power from the many to the few, 
and in the process increase his 
own control over the country.

Net neutrality, in its simplest 

form, is a mandate that prohibits 
internet services from favoring 
certain 
websites 
or 
services 

in order to further their own 
business interests.

For example, if a customer 

purchases internet access through 
Comcast, he or she has as much 
freedom to access Google as Netflix 
or Hulu. However, if Comcast is able 
to charge more for specialized, high-
demand internet services, they will 
do so in order to make their own 
streaming services more attractive — 
slowing down and making popular 
websites more expensive.

Apart 
from 
the 
increased 

cost and inconvenience accrued 
by consumers because of net 
neutrality’s repeal, the action by 
the FCC reveals the detrimental 
state of the government under 
Trump’s 
leadership 
and 
the 

diminishing power of the everyday 
American citizen.

During both Obama and Trump’s 

respective terms, the American 
public voiced their concern at the 
prospect of repealing net neutrality, 
highlighted in a University of 
Maryland report claiming that 83 
percent of voters rejected the FCC’s 
new legislation.

On a more macro level, Obama 

declared net neutrality to be 
a driving force in “protecting 
innovation and creating a level 
playing field for the next generation 
of entrepreneurs.”

Yet even more important than 

his 
acknowledgement 
of 
the 

internet’s capability to facilitate 
business growth and creativity 
is his recognition of internet as a 
manifestation of democracy. Shortly 
after the FCC upheld net neutrality 
regulations in 2015, Obama stated 
that “nothing can stand in the way 
of millions of voices calling for 
change,” referring to the numerous 
petitions sent to the FCC and 
Congress detailing the importance 
of freedom on the internet.

Trump clearly does not share the 

same values.

Where Obama highlighted the 

importance of democracy and 
individual freedom in his support 
of net neutrality, Trump exposed 
his desire to place the power of 
the internet — one of the most 
instrumental tools for political 
and social discourse in the 21st 
century — in the hands of the few. 
And in doing so, he illuminates 

his desire to gain control over 
the millions of voices crying out 
across the country.

With the surfacing of Trump’s 

alleged banned words report to the 
CDC only a few days after the FCC 
repeal, public fear of a diminishing 
democracy 
grew. 
The 
report 

centers on a list of seven words 
that Trump deemed inappropriate 
or too controversial for the CDC 
to publish, including factual and 
unbiased terms like “science-based” 
and “evidence-based.”

At first glance, the egregiousness 

of Trump’s report seems almost 
comical and hard to believe.

Though the CDC has pushed 

back against the legitimacy of this 
claim, the pure existence of such 
allegations against Trump speak 
not only to his deceitful character, 
but to his desire for censorship 
and control.

While it would be a gross 

exaggeration to liken the state of this 
country to censored dictatorships 
like that of North Korea, seeds of 
such a power structure can be seen 
in Trump’s recent policy choices.

One such example lies within 

the lack of attention given to the 
recent net neutrality legislation, as 
inadequate media coverage is an 
infamous characteristic of North 
Korea’s dictatorship. Similar to 
how Kim Jong-Un’s regime has 
restricted internet access to “a small 
section of the elite,” the FCC’s new 
policy has the same motive albeit to 
a much lesser extent — limiting the 
capacity of the internet based on the 
desires of a few large companies.

Should Trump continue to 

censor the content given to the 
public while at the same time 
limiting the total amount of 
information available, this sets a 
dangerous precedent for the future 
of individual freedoms as it relates 
to media and information sharing.

And while it might be a few 

months 
or 
years 
before 
the 

average American sees tangible 
consequences from Trump’s recent 
policy, the danger lies more in 
principle than practicality.

As the power in the country 

becomes more concentrated, it may 
be another four years before the 
masses regain control and truly 
make their voices heard.

The NCAA’s new early signing 

period has had several effects.

One of those? The yearly 

coaching carousel began spinning 
earlier than usual.

Among 
the 
bigger 
moves 

include Chip Kelly to UCLA, 
Herm Edwards to Arizona State, 
Scott Frost to Nebraska and Jimbo 
Fisher to Texas A&M.

It appears there are a couple 

that will affect Michigan as well.

Willie Taggart left Oregon for 

Florida State in early December, 
and according to reports, has 
been in discussions with offensive 
tackles and tight ends coach Greg 
Frey. Frey’s not the only member 
of the Wolverines’ staff that 
has been involved with rumors. 
According to several reports, 
quarterbacks coach and passing 
game coordinator Pep Hamilton 
was in the conversation for jobs 
at Arizona State and Mississippi 
State.

Accordingly, 
Jim 
Harbaugh 

hasn’t stood pat. FootballScoop 
reported 
in 
December 
that 

Harbaugh met with Dan Enos to 
discuss a position on Michigan’s 
staff.

Enos, previously the offensive 

coordinator 
at 
Arkansas, 
has 

significant ties to the state of 
Michigan 
— 
and 
Michigan 

State. He played quarterback for 
the Spartans, served as a grad 
assistant and eventually became 
an assistant coach under Mark 
Dantonio.

Enos also coached Central 

Michigan for five seasons, between 
2010-14, finishing with a 26-36 
record before leaving for Arkansas.

With Enos at the helm, the 

Razorbacks’ 
offense 
steadily 

worsened. 
In 
2015, 
Arkansas 

averaged 35.9 points per game, 
ranking 27th in the nation. The 
following two years, it ranked 
No. 57 and No. 62, respectively, 
before Enos was let go after Bret 
Bielema’s firing.

Recruits 
at 
Army 
All-

American, 
Under 
Armour 

games

The 
Wolverines 
signed 
16 

recruits during the December 
signing period, and several are due 
to play in prestigious high school 
all-star games over the next few 
days.

Four-star tight end Mustapha 

Muhammad 
and 
four-star 

cornerback Myles Sims are in 
Orlando, Fla. practicing for the 

Under Armour All-America Game 
on Jan. 4.

Muhammad, from Texas, and 

Sims, from Georgia, are Michigan’s 
two top-ranked signees.

Meanwhile, a trio of signees 

are participating at the Army 
All-American Bowl down in San 
Antonio, Tx. Four-star linebacker 
Cameron 
McGrone, 
four-star 

offensive tackle Jalen Mayfield 
and four-star defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson have been practicing 
this week in preparation for 
Saturday’s game.

McGrone chose the Wolverines 

over Notre Dame and Indiana 
this past summer, while Mayfield 
flipped 
his 
commitment 

from 
Minnesota 
last 
spring. 

Hutchinson, who played his high 
school ball in Michigan, is the son 
of former Michigan player Chris 
Hutchinson.

Pair of former Michigan stars 

finalists for Hall of Fame

Wednesday, Steve Hutchinson 

and Ty Law were named finalists 
for this year’s Pro Football Hall of 
Fame class.

Hutchinson, a famed offensive 

lineman who played 12 seasons 
in the NFL and earned seven 
Pro Bowl nods, is one of the most 
decorated linemen in program 

history.

A four-year starter under Lloyd 

Carr, Hutchinson was a member 
of the 1997 championship team. 
He was a four-time All-Big Ten 
selection, a two-time All American 
and Big Ten Offensive Lineman of 

the Year.

Law 
enjoyed 
a 
similarly 

rewarding career. He was a five-
time Pro Bowler, won three Super 
Bowls with the New England 
Patriots and was named to the 
NFL 2000s All-Decade team.

He arrived in Ann Arbor just 

before Hutchinson, playing three 
seasons between 1992 and 1994. 
Law was a two-time unanimous 
All-Big Ten selection and earned 
first-team All-American honors in 
his final season at Michigan.

Notebook: Harbaugh in discussions with Enos, recruits at All-Star games

ORION SANG

Managing Sports Editor

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh may be looking to fill yet-to-be-determined vacancies on his coaching staff.

GLI Notebook: Glendening’s talk spurs ‘M’, Lockwood out with injury 

Momentum shifts are often 

quickly and easily apparent. A 
goaltender makes a huge save, 
a special-teams unit kills off a 
five-minute major penalty or a 
defenseman levels an opposing 
forward with a clattering hit on 
the boards, visibly energizing a 
team.

Occasionally, though, they take 

place more subtly. And they might 
not even come from someone on 
the team.

Michigan 
hockey 
fans 

remember Luke Glendening well. 
After joining the Wolverines as a 
walk-on, the Grand Rapids, Mich. 
native eventually became a two-
year captain, and helped lead 
Michigan to the 2011 National 
Championship game. Glendening 
played in every game his final 
three seasons and recorded 70 
points in 165 career games.

After the Wolverines dropped 

their Great Lakes Invitational 
opener to Bowling Green on 
Monday, Glendening, who now 
plays for the Detroit Red Wings, 
spoke to his former program.

“He just talked about when he 

came here he was a walk-on and 
never really promised anything. 
The coaches told him he may 
never get to play here,” said junior 
forward Cooper Marody. “Just 
with hard work and determination 
and passion for Michigan he was 
able to be a captain for two years, 
and obviously also he’s had a 
great career in the NHL thus far. 
He just passionately spoke about 
Michigan and what it takes to be a 
Michigan man every day.”

It 
didn’t 
appear, 
however, 

that Glendening’s visit made an 
immediate impact. After giving up 
four goals in the first 24 minutes 
against the Falcons, Michigan 
came out just as flat against 
Michigan State a day later. The 
Wolverines conceded a goal in the 
game’s first minute and left the 
ice at the first intermission down 
another.

But according to Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson, that was when 
Glendening’s words of wisdom 
began to soak in.

“I thought he gave a real good 

talk,” Pearson said. “From the 
heart, not just something made 
up, and I thought that was really 
good and I thought we had time to 
reflect on that discussion he had 
with our team before the game. 
Not that that was the miracle pill 
or something like that, but I think 
it was important.”

The Wolverines came out of the 

locker room a noticeably different 
team. Sophomore forward James 
Sanchez closed the lead to one 
with his first goal of the season, 
and after Michigan State answered 
back with a power-play goal, 
Michigan scored four unanswered 
to run away with the contest.

“He really just told us after 

yesterday’s loss to take a look in the 

mirror,” said senior defenseman 
Cutler Martin. “It’s easy to point 
fingers, maybe, but everyone needs 
to do their job and make sure they 
do it to the best of their abilities, so 
look at yourself and look at what 
you can do better.”

Lockwood out for extended 

period

Michigan knew it wouldn’t 

have three of its best players for 
the 
Great 
Lakes 
Invitational. 

Sophomore 
forward 
Will 

Lockwood, 
freshman 
forward 

Josh 
Norris 
and 
defenseman 

Quinn Hughes were selected to the 
United States National Team for 
the World Junior Championships 
in Buffalo, N.Y. from Dec. 26 to 
Jan. 5.

However, the Wolverines might 

be without one of them for longer 
than anticipated. During a U.S. 
victory against Canada on Dec. 
29, Lockwood took a hit from 

behind and fell to the ice, landing 
hard on his left shoulder. Shortly 
afterwards, he was ruled out for 
the remainder of the tournament 
with an “upper-body” injury.

On Monday, Pearson stated 

that he was “not sure” about 
Lockwood’s status, but that his 
injury might be a season-ending 
one — a potentially catastrophic 
blow 
to 
Michigan’s 
offense. 

Through 16 games, Lockwood was 
tied as Michigan’s fourth-leading 
scorer with 11 points.

“We’ll reevaluate him when he 

gets back in (from World Juniors),” 
Pearson said. “It’s a possibility he 
could be out for the year, but it’s a 
possibility he could come back. But 
he’s going to miss a few weeks for 
sure.”

Cutler Martin makes impact 

in return

On 
Oct. 
28, 
the 
senior 

defenseman took the ice against 

Penn State. He wouldn’t do so 
again until Monday.

An upper-body injury rendered 

Martin unable to play for most of 
the last two months. And even 
as Martin returned to health, he 
faced another obstacle: winter 
break. During the last three weeks, 
Michigan practiced infrequently 
— forcing Martin to rapidly 
reacclimate on the fly, instead of 
easing back into action.

This made his performance 

against the Spartans on Tuesday 
all the more unexpected. Not only 
did Martin score the go-ahead 
goal, but he was also a dangerous 
presence 
from 
the 
point 

throughout the game with his 
hard slap-shot. Martin was second 
on the Wolverines with five shots 
on goal, all of which came in the 
crucial final period.

“I’m just happy to be back on 

the ice,” Martin said. “Just being 

back out there with the guys and 
getting the win.”

Added Pearson: “I thought he 

played extremely well. He’s missed 
a lot of games, but we didn’t even 
have practices really the last two 
weeks. So for him to come in and 
play as well as he did is important.”

For a Michigan defense that 

has struggled all season, Martin 
— one of just two seniors on 
the blue line — adds toughness 
and physicality, and should be a 
major key if the Wolverines are 
to improve upon their lackluster 
defensive ranking.

Secondary options come up 

big

Martin’s goal was just one part 

of a surprising trend for Michigan. 
Three other Wolverines lit the 
lamp for the first time this season 
during the GLI. Freshman forward 
Jack 
Becker 
scored 
against 

Bowling Green — albeit with a 
helpful assist from the Falcons’ 
goaltender. Sanchez opened the 
scoring on Tuesday, and freshman 
forward Michael Pastujov finished 
off a rebound from close range to 
record Michigan’s second goal 
later in the period.

The Wolverines have struggled 

to obtain consistent production 
when their first line of Marody and 
senior forwards Tony Calderone 
and Dexter Dancs isn’t on the ice. 
Without Lockwood, Hughes and 
Norris for the GLI, these problems 
had the potential to be amplified. 
Michigan’s secondary offensive 
threats, however, made sure that 
wasn’t the case.

“You need someone to step up,” 

Pearson said Tuesday. “I thought 
we had some of the secondary 
scoring come from guys we needed 
it to come from. Mike Pastujov had 
a big goal, his first career goal at 
Michigan. James Sanchez scored 
his first goal.

“I’m really proud of the effort of 

the guys. We get behind, we stay 
with it, we’re without three really 
good hockey players — excellent 
hockey players — and it’s good to 
see some other guys step in and get 
it done.”

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Senior defenseman Cutler Martin made an impact in his return from injury, scoring the go-ahead goal in Michigan’s 6-4 win over Michigan State on Tuesday.

Winovich announces his return to Michigan

Chase Winovich didn’t dream 

of the NFL in high school.

Ask him if he always wanted 

to play professional football, and 
he’ll recount a memory from his 
junior year at Thomas Jefferson 
High 
School. 

Then-Florida 
State 
defensive 

coordinator 
Sal 
Sunseri 

approached 
him, asking if he 
wanted to play in 
the NFL.

Winovich 

told 
him 
yes, 

but admitted in 
November 
that 

he didn’t know what the future 
held. He was just three months 
removed from getting his first 
college offer, had just switched 
positions and was still “trying to 
make it” in high school.

But he made it there. He made 

it in college too, despite plenty of 
obstacles that stood in his way.

Now, despite the opportunity 

to 
declare 
for 
the 
NFL 

Draft, 
Winovich 
announced 

Wednesday, via Twitter, that he 
will be returning to Michigan for 
his final year of eligibility.

With the decision, Winovich 

will spend 2018 finishing out what 
has been a whirlwind career.

He 
came 
to 

Ann Arbor to play 
SAM linebacker 
under 
Brady 

Hoke, moved to 
tight end upon 
Jim Harbaugh’s 
arrival, hurt his 
PCL in a ensuing 
Spring 
Game 

and pulled his 
hamstring during 
the first week of 

camp.

He found himself as the sixth 

or 
seventh-string 
tight 
end, 

relegated to another year of scout 
team snaps, before eventually 
being moved back to defense 
during Michigan’s 2015 Citrus 
Bowl practices.

It was a move Winovich 

once equated to LeBron James’ 

Cleveland homecoming. More 
modestly, his teammates said 
he had finally found a home at 
defensive end.

It’s not an unheard of journey 

in college football, but that doesn’t 
make it any less difficult. How 
Winovich turned that journey 
into a potential 
NFL 
contract 

is perhaps best 
summarized 
by 

Matt 
Thompson 

— 
a 
former 

Michigan 
quarterback and 
one of Winovich’s 
best friends.

“I 
think 

the one of the 
funniest 
quotes 

that I ever heard about Chase 
was (when) I was talking to 
my mom,” Thompson said in 
November. “And she just met 
Chase, she loved Chase. And she 
said, ‘Too bad Chase wasn’t born 
in another era, he could’ve been 
the next Alexander the Great or 
something.’ ”

Hyperbole 
aside, 
it’s 
an 

accurate summary of Winovich.

That sort of drive is what 

prompted an honest, inward 
inspection 
from 
Winovich 

when he was asked what would 
motivate him to return to Ann 
Arbor on the Thursday prior to 
the Outback Bowl.

“As a Michigan 

football 
player 

there’s not a lot 
of things that I 
can really say we 
did,” 
Winovich 

said then. “We 
lost to Michigan 
State this year. 
Two 
years 

ago we lost to 
Michigan State. 
I could just go 

on and on about those losses. And 
we’ve just been so close. It’s just a 
matter of, I don’t know, hanging 
my hat on something.”

Hanging his hat on something, 

however, may not be as simple as 
wins and losses.

After all, Winovich watched 

firsthand 
as 
Brady 
Hoke’s 

final season unfolded, and the 
Wolverines finished 5-7.

He has been in Ann Arbor as 

Jim Harbaugh helped revive the 
program, even if this year’s 8-5 
finish is a marked regression — 
his role increasing all the way.

And it’s for those reasons that 

a prior admission may offer a 
more nuanced insight. Sitting on 
the second floor of Schembechler 
Hall 
in 
early 
November, 

pondering the question of what 
he wanted to do after college if 
the NFL wasn’t his primary focus 
in high school, Winovich reached 
one conclusion.

“I just wanted to be a Michigan 

man and help make this program 
great again,” he said then. “Even 
if I don’t personally win a national 
championship. I know damn 
well that when I leave, Michigan 
football is in a better state than 
when I left it. That’s something I 
can hang my hat on at the end of 
the day.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Redshirt junior defensive end Chase Winovich announced his decision to return for his final season Wednesday.

Redshirt junior could have entered the NFL Draft, but opted not to

“It’s just a matter 

of, I don’t know, 

hanging my hat 

on something.”

“Michigan 

football is in a 

better state than 

when I left it.”

Wagner struggling since return from foot injury

There’s never an opportune 

time for an injury.

That’s especially the case 

when the injury happens to a 
team’s second-leading scorer.

Yet, 
when 
junior 
center 

Moritz 
Wagner 
rolled 
his 

ankle Dec. 12 against Texas, it 
seemed like it was coming at as 
ideal a time as any. Michigan 
overcame the injury to beat 
the Longhorns, and then it 
had matchups against Detroit, 
Alabama A&M and Jacksonville 
— games the Wolverines were 
likely to win with or without a 
healthy Wagner.

And Wagner returned to 

action in a timely fashion — 
just over two weeks after being 
injured — against the Dolphins. 
Now, it seems the injury has had 
lingering effects. Wagner has 
shown signs of discomfort with 
a lack of production in his two 
games since his return. In his 
20 minutes against Jacksonville, 
Wagner scored a season-low 

seven points. Tuesday, against 
Iowa, he beat that by scoring just 
four points in his 16 minutes.

“He’s just not right after the 

injury. He’s just not right,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
after the game against the 
Hawkeyes. “We’ve just got to 
get back, and he’s got to get, you 
know, when it’s your feet, he was 
really 
tender, 

and 
he 
was 

walking funny. 
Now he’s fine, 
but getting that 
back.

“If 
any 
of 

you have ever 
had an injury to 
your foot, and 
then, when you 
get that cast off, 
you don’t even 
know, it feels so funny. He’s just 
not himself with his feet. He’s 
way off balance. We’ve just got 
to get back to basics with him. 
And I’m concerned about it, 
because this is something, we 
need Moe Wagner.”

And the Wolverines will need 

Wagner soon. After Michigan 

hosts Illinois – one of the lesser 
Big Ten teams – it encounters 
Purdue and Michigan State, 
arguably the two best teams in 
the conference.

The 
Boilermakers 
and 

Spartans also get a majority of 
their production from their size. 
Both have skilled big men who, 
even with a healthy Wagner, 

will likely pose a 
problem for the 
Wolverines.

So 
there 
is 

a bit of a sense 
of 
urgency 

when 
it 
comes 

to 
Wagner’s 

recovery. Beilein 
says 
it 
is 
no 

longer a matter of 
time. Wagner is 
healthy, but now 

they just have to get him back 
into the shape he was in before 
the injury.

“I think we’re ready to dive 

in right now,” Beilein said. “I 
think he’s healthy, but it was 
like, okay, yesterday in practice, 
this was his first day that I felt 
we could really go at him, but 

we had a game the next day. So, 
we’ve got to get him, tomorrow’s 
a day off. Thursday, we’ve got to 
get his cardio up, and we’ve got 
to get his balance back. He’s off 
balance. We’ve just got to get 
him more fundamentally sound 
again.”

If Wagner can revert to his old 

form soon, then the point will be 
moot. The last two games will be 
looked back on as a blip on the 
radar of an otherwise successful 
season.

Sophomore center Jon Teske 

has been able to relieve any stress 
caused by Wagner’s slow return, 
as he had seven points and six 
rebounds against Iowa and has 
been a key defensive mainstay 
when he’s in the game. But as 
Beilein said, Michigan needs 
Wagner. It needs his 15.6 points 
per game and 7.8 rebounds per 
game he was averaging before 
the injury.

Not only do the Wolverines 

need Wagner to be himself 
again, but with tough games 
against the class of the Big Ten 
on the horizon, they will likely 
need it sooner rather than later. 

RYAN MCLOUGHLIN/Daily

Junior center Moritz Wagner has struggled in the two games since his return from a foot injury that he suffered in Michigan’s Dec. 12 game against Texas.

“I’m concerned 

about it, because 

... we need Moe 

Wagner.”

Wolverines favored to 
win against Wisconsin

Thursday, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team has 
another chance at history.

With 123 career victories, 

coach Kim Barnes Arico sits 
tied with Sue Guevara for the 
most in the program history. 
This will be the Wolverines’ (1-1 
Big Ten, 12-3 overall) second 
attempt to put their coach atop 
the all-time list after losing this 
past Sunday to No. 18 Iowa.

But No. 22 Michigan should 

feel confident to do so against a 
meager Wisconsin squad.

While the Badgers record 

(0-2, 
7-8) 
isn’t 
atrocious, 

statistically, they’re a mess.

Wisconsin ranks dead last in 

the Big Ten in points per game 
(63.3), blocked shots (45) and 
three-point percentage (.286). 
They 
also 
rank 
second-to-

last in free-throw percentage 
(.664) and steals (90). To make 
matters worse, they’re third 
worst in turnover margin (-2.1), 
scoring margin (0.1), field goal 
percentage (.405). and three-
pointers per game (4.9).

And 
despite 
being 
a 

conference 
matchup, 
don’t 

expect 
much 
support 
from 

the Badgers fans, who are as 
reliable as the team is on the 
court. Wisconsin is last in the 
Big Ten in attendance.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Badgers, the conference title 
isn’t decided based on defensive 
rebounding percentage, where 
they rank first at .734. But 
even this is nullified when 
considering 
that 
they 
rank 

10th in offensive rebounding; 
this deficiency should only be 
amplified by Michigan’s first 
ranked defensive rebounding.

These overall pitiful numbers 

only project to be even worse 
against a staunch Wolverine 
team.

Under 
the 
leadership 
of 

senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and 
senior 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston, 
Michigan 
hasn’t 

just been beating teams – but 

dominating them.

The 
Wolverines 
have 

outscored their opponents by an 
astounding 17.5 points and have 
won by a double digit scoring 
margin in all but two victories. 
Expect more of the same on 
Thursday.

Look for scoring catalyst 

Flaherty – who averages 22.8 
points per game – to have a 
field day against a poor Wisco 
defense. Oh yeah, don’t forget 
Hallie Thome. The junior center 
has been tearing up defenses 
down low, averaging 16 points 
and 7.1 rebounds.

And 
don’t 
expect 
the 

deplorable Badgers’ offense to 
suddenly come alive. Michigan’s 
defense has been as good, if not 
better, than its offense. The 
Wolverines rank second in the 
Big Ten in defense, allowing 
just 58.7 points per game.

The 
defensive 
anchor 

this season (and last) has 
undoubtedly 
been 
Dunston. 

The forward is fourth in the 
conference with 9.9 rebounds 
and 12th in steals with 1.8. What 
makes 
Dunston 
particularly 

potent is her ability to guard 
multiple 
positions. 
Barnes 

Arico has often pointed out 
how Dunston usually defends 
the other team’s best player 
regardless of position.

So don’t be surprised to see 

Dunston matched up against 
guard Cayla McMorris. The 
senior received a nod as a All-
Big Ten Honorable Mention in 
2017 and is currently averaging 
14.6 points.

But it would realistically take 

a career day from McMorris 
for Wisconsin to come out 
triumphant.

Especially considering that 

despite Barnes Arico finding 
success in years prior, and 
holding the program’s highest 
winning percentage at .651, this 
may be her best squad yet.

So yes, even coming off a 

loss, the Wolverines should feel 
buoyant in their ability to get 
Barnes Arico that illustrious 
win.

Loss to Ohio State still 
on the mind of Michigan

After 
Iowa 
trimmed 

Michigan’s 18-point lead to 12 at 
halftime, nobody on the visiting 
bench was comfortable.

That 
discomfort 
grew 

exponentially 
when 
the 

Hawkeyes began the second 
half with a quick 5-0 run to 
trim the once expansive lead to 
just seven. Iowa forward Tyler 
Cook was having his way down 
low, the defense was beginning 
to feed off the crowd and after 
a blazing 8-for-11 start from 
beyond the arc, the Wolverines 
couldn’t buy a bucket.

It was déjà vu all over again.
Just four weeks prior — on 

the road against Ohio State — 
Michigan coughed up a 20-point 
first half lead, scored just 18 
second half points and left 
Columbus winless and with an 
identity crisis to repair.

“We couldn’t make a basket 

and we couldn’t make a bright 
play in that time,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “When 
things got a little tough, we really 
had trouble stepping up. So it’s a 
big area we’ve got to work at. But 
also at other times in the game, 
when there are simple plays to 
be made, we make them.

“I called every number I could 

call, and it didn’t happen.”

This time, in need of a 

spark, he called number ‘4’ and 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers 
answered the bell. Combined 
with 
a 
commandeering 

performance from sophomore 
point guard Zavier Simpson 
and nine key second-half points 
from senior guard Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman, 
the 

Wolverines escaped with a 75-68 
road win to push its conference 
record to 2-1.

But when asked after the 

game Tuesday about whether 
the loss to the Buckeyes ever 

came to mind during Iowa’s 
comeback effort, Livers hardly 
waited for the question to end.

Instead of shying away from 

the most embarrassing loss of 
the season, Livers and his team 
have embraced it.

“That’s all we talk about all 

season,” Livers said with clarity 
and vigor. “That we can’t come 
out here in the second half and 
let them come hit us. We’ve got 
to hit them before they hit us.”

A back-breaking loss like 

that can send a team in either 
direction. For some teams — 
especially young teams like this 
one — blowing a 20-point lead 
against a conference foe can 
send it into a downward spiral. 
For others, it can galvanize a 
response. Last season, after a 
16-point loss at Illinois, Illini 
forward 
Maverick 
Morgan 

called the Wolverines a “white-
collar 
team.” 
Michigan, 
of 

course, blew Illinois out in 
the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament, en route to a Big 
Ten Tournament Title and a 
Sweet 16 appearance. A clear 
turning point in the season, 
the Wolverines even posted the 
quote throughout the locker 
room and referenced the dig 
several times throughout the 
season.

That loss changed Michigan’s 

season. Livers believes the loss 
at Ohio State could have the 
same effect.

The Wolverines have won 

each of their six games since 
that 
collapse 
in 
Columbus, 

and the win in Iowa was their 
staunchest evidence that the 
loss has been a motivator, not a 
deterrent.

“I think that’s going to help 

us going forward in the season a 
lot,” Livers said. “I’m pretty sure 
that’s a key point in our season, 
is that loss. I’m not happy we 
lost, but I’m kinda glad because 
we can learn from (it).”

Writer, director and supreme 
leader Greta Gerwig’s semi-
autobiographical, 
coming-of-
age masterpiece “Lady Bird” is 
the film of the year — perhaps 
the 
decade. 
“Lady 
Bird” 
encapsulates the high school 
experience, filled with crushes, 
heartbreak, 
controlling 
mothers and everything in 
between with expert timing, 
quick 
wit 
and 
undeniable 
heart. Following the quirky 
and ambitious Christine “Lady 
Bird” 
McPherson 
(Saoirse 
Ronan, “Brooklyn”) through 
her tumultuous senior year 
of Catholic high school in 
Sacramento, Cali., the film 

questions the relationships we 
cherish and the way we define 
home.
Despite 
the 
seemingly 
conventional narrative, “Lady 
Bird” is as original as its titular 
character, infusing the classic 
bildungsroman with a much 
needed 
fresh 
perspective. 
The fraught mother-daughter 
relationship in the film is a 
relatable one, reminding the 
audience of their own angst-
filled teenage restlessness and 
the mothers that dealt with it 
the best they could. Instead of 
taking a magnifying glass to 
the transitory infatuations of 
high school hormones like the 

coming-of-age films of yore, 
“Lady Bird” emphasizes the 
significance of the mother-
daughter bond while touching 
on the power and love of female 
friendship. The film not only 
gives fresh life to the coming-
of-age genre defined by John 
Hughes and Richard Linklater, 
but also makes room for the 
new wave of female power 
in Hollywood in the form of 
actress-turned-auteur 
Greta 
Gerwig. If 2017 is the year of 
the woman, that woman in 
Greta Gerwig.

Best Films 2017: Greta Gerwig’s directorial debut

A24

FILM

1. “Lady Bird”

“The Florida Project” is the 
year’s most heart-wrenching 
drama, but it’s also 2017’s 
most heart-warming comedy. 
How did writer-director Sean 
Baker, who has demonstrated a 
penchant for exploring ignored 
communities and sub-cultures 
with a deft eye with previous 
notable 
films 
“Tangerine” 
and “Starlet,” create such a 
powerful picture? Credit is due 
first to his cast of actors, both 
experienced and acting for 
the first time. The legendary 
Willem Dafoe (“Murder on 
the Orient Express”) blends in 
perfectly against newcomers 

Bria Vinaite and Brooklynn 
Prince, 
the 
two 
of 
which 
demonstrate 
enough 
energy 
and spark on screen to power 
an engine. 
Baker’s 
passionate 
and 
honest 
portrayal 
of 
the 
hidden homeless living next 
to Disneyworld is dotted by 
the vivid oranges and purples 
of “Orange World,” “Twistee 
Treat” and “Futureland Inn.” 
Cinematographer Alexis Zabe 
trains the camera on the world 
of the children, and Kissimmee, 
Flor. is seen through their 
eyes. The result is a dystopian, 
albeit often very, very funny, 

sort of “Little Rascals,” with 
the adventures of the young 
children of the hotel guiding 
the film. It provides a welcome 
refuge from the truly disturbing 
other storylines that weave 
their way through the film.
“The 
Florida 
Project” 
is 
an engaging and often brutal 
watch, but it’s poignant and 
unforgettable. 
And, 
dare 
I 
say it, no other film this year, 
maybe this century, and maybe 
ever, has such a glorious final 
shot.

Writer 

2. “Call Me By Your Name”

3. “The Florida Project”

As 
an 
avid 
rom-com 
enthusiast, I have seen my fair 
share of incredibly beautiful 
and incredibly terrible movies 
featuring quirky young adults 
who fall in love. After watching 
“The Big Sick,” I can easily say 
this movie stands as one of 
the best and most compelling 
romantic comedies, and movies 
in general, that I have ever seen. 
Written by and starring Kumail 
Nanjiani 
(“Silicon 
Valley”), 
“The Big Sick” sparkles with 
sharp humor and a bubbly 
effervescence that can only 

come from the mind of deeply 
talented comedians.
Zoe 
Kazan 
(“My 
Blind 
Brother”) 
is 
the 
perfect 
counterpart 
for 
Nanjiani’s 
brand of dry, poignant humor; 
she is witty, playful and sincere 
in an infectious way that makes 
Nanjiani’s love for her wholly 
believable. The film’s brilliance 
lies in Nanjiani learning to love 
Emily through his interactions 
with 
her 
parents, 
played 
expertly by Holly Hunter 
(“Batman v Superman: Dawn 
of Justice”) and Ray Romano 

(“Vinyl”). Nanjiani’s story is a 
fresh take on the formulaic rom-
com narrative that explores 
the process of love. “The Big 
Sick” is more than the classic 
story of a rebellion against 
the cultural expectations of 
one’s immigrant family; it is a 
deeply human story about the 
importance of one’s cultural 
roots, the dynamics of family 
and the perseverance of love 
against all odds.

— Sydney Cohen, Daily Arts 
Writer

4. “The Big Sick”

Martin McDonagh’s “Three 
Billboards 
Outside 
Ebbing, 
Missouri,” a story about a 
mother’s devotion to solving 
her daughter’s murder in her 
own way, takes a fresh and 
unusual perspective on the 
subjects of tragedy and loss. It 
never falls into the convention 
of 
maudlin 
sentimentality, 
but 
rather, 
treats 
it 
with 
unforgiving bite and strength. 
Mildred 
Hayes 
(Frances 
McDormand, “Hail, Caesar!”), 

a renegade and intimidating 
force of nature, is driven by the 
purity of a mother’s love and 
loyalty to her daughter, only 
carried out by McDormand’s 
performative tour de force, 
something only a seasoned 
and gifted professional could 
produce. 
Woody 
Harrelson 
(“The Glass Castle”) rivets 
as 
usual 
in 
his 
portrayal 
of Sheriff Willoughby, the 
cancer-stricken hard-ass with 
a hidden heart of gold. Lucas 

Hedges (“Lady Bird”) plays 
Frances’s son, Robbie, and 
he proves yet again, that he 
masters the role of the angsty 
teen and reminds us that he 
is among young Hollywood’s 
finest. 
“Three 
Billboards” 
returns us to an unforgiving, 
unpolished reality and above 
all else, reminds us of the value 
of loyalty.

Outside Ebbing, Missouri”
6. “Three Billboards

“Columbus,” 
helmed 
by 
writer-director Kogonada, is a 
beautifully-paced 
movie 
that 
leaves a lot to contemplate. 
Meditative cinematography and 
strong acting from John Cho 
(“Harold and Kumar”) and Haley 
Lu Richardson (“The Edge of 
Seventeen”) drive this film as it 
addresses the complicated nature 
of 
parent-child 
relationships. 
When 
Jin 
(Cho) 
rushes 
to 
suburban Indiana to tend to his 
comatose father, he must come 
to terms with his duty as a son 

with help from the thoughtful 
Casey (Lu-Richardson). Their 
unexpected friendship is one full 
of introspective conversations, 
stunning 
architecture 
and 
arguments on the responsibilities 
of family. 
The wide shots and well-
chosen 
settings 
display 
the 
artistic genius of Kogonada and 
promise more to come from this 
newcomer. The script lends a 
fresh voice from a minority group 
often passed over on screen 
as Korean family values are 

compared to those of Americans 
across 
generational 
lines. 
“Columbus” also gives a region 
of the United States considered 
“fly-over country” a moment in 
the spotlight, lending a reprieve 
from the countless stories set 
in New York and Los Angeles. 
Although snubbed at the Golden 
Globes this year, “Columbus” is 
well-deserving of all the praise 
and accolades. 

— Meghan Chou, Daily Arts 
Writer

7. “Columbus”

8. “The Shape of Water”

The elevator pitch for “Good 
Time” would’ve felt out of 
place on a top 10 list just a few 
years ago. Two brothers — one 
mentally disabled and the other 
profoundly slimy — botch a 
bank robbery and set in motion 
a plot that sprints through a 
clammy urban environment: 
the visual equivalent of cold 
sweats. But thank god we’ve 
moved past the days where 
“The Post” would’ve been a 
shoe-in for top billing so genre 
films like “Good Time” can 
finally get their due.
But the Safdie Brothers take 

a tired genre (crime thriller) 
and an over-shot city (New 
York) and extract and amplify 
their strongest characteristics: 
their grit, speed and neon 
glow. The result is a heart-
racing emotional rollercoaster 
that doesn’t twist, but swerves 
from one extreme to another. 
Robert 
Pattinson’s 
(“The 
Lost City of Z”) performance 
as Connie, the slimy older 
brother who masterminds the 
robbery, is set to be the most 
tragically overlooked of the 
year. His eyes scan the world he 
barrels through with so much 

desperation and fear I catch 
myself almost feeling sorry 
for him. Connie is destructive, 
selfish and tragic and as him, 
Pattison 
sheds 
any 
doubts 
left over from his “Twilight” 
days. All this and a score by 
Daniel Lopatin (who records 
as Oneohtrix Point Never) with 
an original song featuring Iggy 
Pop make “Good Time” one 
of the most relentlessly paced 
and unexpectedly compelling 
movies of the year.

Madeleine 
Gaudin,

9. “Good Time”

Like every film on this list, 
“Blade Runner 2049” is what 
cinema is all about. From 
a technical standpoint, it’s 
a masterpiece of sight and 
sound, 
nearly 
unparalleled 
in 
film 
this 
century. 
It’s 
perfectly shot by living legend 
Roger 
Deakins 
(“Sicario”), 
and the daunting production 
design 
combines 
with 
his 
cinematography to create one 
of the most gorgeous movies 
in recent memory. The score 
by Hans Zimmer (“Dunkirk”) 
and Benjamin Wallfisch (“It”) 
works as a tribute to Vangelis’s 
iconic work on the original, 
but stands just as well on its 

own as the beautiful, eerie, 
pulse-pounding backbone to 
the film. Even when it isn’t 
playing, 
the 
sound 
design 
— the cacophony of 2049 
Los Angeles — provides a 
soundtrack all its own.
The story Denis Villeneuve 
(“Arrival”) 
crafts 
is 
what 
makes “2049” what it is: a 
moving tale of love, loss and 
what it means to be human 
set against the backdrop of 
revolution. There’s a sense 
that 
Villeneuve’s 
already 
impressive career has been 
leading to this. In addition 
to 
the 
film’s 
technical 
achievements, he directs his 

ensemble 
to 
unanimously 
superb 
performances, 
from 
Ryan Gosling’s (“La La Land”) 
commanding work in the lead 
role to what is hopefully a 
star-making turn from Ana 
de Armas (“War Dogs”), even 
down through Dave Bautista 
(“Guardians of the Galaxy”) 
and 
Lennie 
James 
(“The 
Walking Dead”) in more minor 
roles. The original “Blade 
Runner” was a great film, but 
“2049” exceeds it as a flat-out 
masterwork on the part of all 
involved.

The joy and agony that 
follow the arc of first love were 
best explored this year in the 
summer 
romance 
between 
Elio 
(Timothée 
Chalamet, 
“Lady Bird”) and Oliver (Armie 
Hammer, 
“The 
Man 
from 
U.N.C.L.E.”). First love is a 
genre that is prone to cliché, 
but, like Gerwig’s handling 
of “Lady Bird,” director Luca 
Guadagnino (“I Am Love”) 
approaches his subject with 
the utmost care and craft. “Call 
Me by Your Name” is a patient 
film, revealing the characters’ 
thoughts and feelings through 

subtle visual storytelling rather 
than clear narration or dialogue. 
Each shot in the gorgeous 
Italian 
countryside 
lingers 
with purpose, from the warm 
stone of the town square to the 
earthy richness of the Perlman’s 
villa. 
Guadagnino’s 
classical 
approach to filmmaking feels 
both timeless and contemporary, 
introducing 
the 
style 
to 
new audiences that may be 
unfamiliar. Chalamet delivers a 
breakout performance, tapping 
into the fragility and sensitivity 
of a young heart. The battle 
between his eagerness and 

reserve is palpable. It’s easy to 
want to ignore internal wishes 
for tender love, a kind of love 
that protects and nurtures, 
but “Call Me by Your Name” 
invites the audience to indulge 
in these feelings and realize 
that, 
perhaps, 
there 
is 
no 
indulgence in submitting to 
these wants. “Call Me by Your 
Name” underscores the passion 
and pleasure of love, but never 
idealizes the condition in which 
it is experienced.

— Jack Brandon, Daily Film 
Editor 

5. “Get Out”

Earlier this year, director 
Jordan Peele wryly tweeted, 
“‘Get Out’ is a documentary.” 
He’s right, of course. Like the best 

of its genre, “Get Out” derives 
its power from the visceral 
panic of reality’s stark truths. 
It’s a movie about the theft 

of Blackness, the disquieting 
anxiety of what it means to live 
in a body that’s simultaneously 
feared and coveted. The scariest 

aspects of “Get Out” aren’t in 
any gore or bloody murder, but 
rather the horror of racism itself, 
and the way it builds toward 
an 
unfathomable 
violence. 
It’s a masterclass in suspense: 
every smile is off somehow, 
every conversation stilted and 
uncomfortable.

From the very first moment, we 
know in our gut that something 
is deeply wrong. The result is a 
movie crackling with tension, 
buzzing like a live wire full of 
nervous energy. There’s a reason 
it was the number one movie in 
America for weeks on end. “Get 
Out” is masterful, through and 

through, with a rallying cry at its 
heart. It’s summarized perfectly 
by the song that opens the film: 
“Stay woke / Don’t you close your 
eyes.” It’s a warning we’d do well 
to remember. 

— Asif Becher, Daily Books 
Editor

“The Shape of Water” is 
Guillermo Del Toro’s (“Crimson 
Peak”) “Beauty and the Beast,” 
telling a love story between a 
mute woman named Elisa (Sally 
Hawkins, “Maudie”) and a fish-
creature (Doug Jones, “Ouija: 
Origin of Evil”). Despite the 
tried and true thematic content, 
the film bursts at the seams with 
creativity and creates a world 
that truly feels like a modern 
fairytale, featuring Del Toro’s 
signature dark brand of magical 
realism. Set in the 1960s, the 

film tells a story of tolerance 
and 
overcoming 
differences 
against the backdrop of a time 
period characterized for its 
intolerance: 
Illustrated 
in 
the film is prejudice based on 
sexual orientation, race, gender 
and national identity.
What’s 
more, 
Hawkins’s 
performance as the mute Elisa 
is one of the most compelling 
of the year. While she does 
communicate 
through 
sign 
language, the bulk of her 
characterization is nonverbal. 

This challenge is no match for 
Hawkins, however, who can 
speak volumes with a single 
glance. 
Elisa 
is 
positively 
charming 
and 
manages 
to 
be so without ever speaking 
a word. She is someone who 
spends much of her time in 
her own head, and Del Toro 
and Hawkins work in perfect 
tandem to bring the viewer 
there as well.

Arguably 
no 
other 
show 
reflected the uncertainty that 
pervaded 2017 quite like “The 
Leftovers.” Then again, “The 
Leftovers” was never about 
certainty to begin with. It was a 
miracle the series lasted so long, 
given its dismal ratings. But 
what the show lacked in strong 
viewership, it made up for with 
an incredible ensemble cast, 
poetic cinematography and bold 
storytelling. The third and final 
season took “The Leftovers” to 
even greater, more ambitious 
depths, shifting the setting from 
small-town Texas to the plains 
of Australia and intensifying the 
character arc of disgruntled cop 
Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux, 
“The Lego Ninjago Movie”). 
This 
season, 
in 
particular, 
raised even larger issues of how 
to search for meaning in a world 
on the brink of destruction.
As the seventh anniversary 

of The Sudden Departure — the 
day in which two percent of the 
global population disappeared 
— approaches, Kevin wrestles 
with a Messiah complex when he 
is called upon to save the world 
from an impending apocalypse 
of 
Biblical 
proportions. 
Meanwhile, Kevin’s long-term 
girlfriend Nora (Carrie Coon, 
“The Post”) considers a path 
that could lead her back to her 
family, all of whom were victims 
of the Sudden Departure. The 
friction between the couple’s 
destinies catalyzes a deeper 
exploration of what it means 
to come to terms with our own 
mortality and how to find peace 
in finality. 
In eight solid episodes, “The 
Leftovers” succeeds in giving 
Kevin and every other character 
much-needed 
closure. 
And 
while most of the season was 
heavy on drama, there were 

some lovely moments of levity 
(e.g. a strangely hilarious penis 
gag in the surreal penultimate 
chapter). Some episodes made 
some daring aesthetic choices 
— A-ha’s iconic, upbeat “Take on 
Me” plays toward the end of a 
particularly gloomy scene. Other 
episodes placed an assortment 
of characters in odd situations — 
a trip on a hedonistic cruise ship 
challenged Matt’s (Christopher 
Eccleston, 
“Doctor 
Who”) 
vehemently 
religious 
views. 
However, these unconventional 
detours felt earned in how they 
helped unpack and resolve each 
character’s inner turmoil when 
facing the unknown. As 2018 
begins, we can only trust that 
a show like “The Leftovers” is 
enough to restore our faith in 
humanity.

Top TV Series: ‘The Leftovers’ a standout of the year

HBO

FILM

1. “The Leftovers”

Twenty-seven red dicks spray-
painted on teachers’ cars, an 
honor student eyewitness, a clear 
motive and an untrustworthy alibi. 
This is the case the school board 
of Hanover High School makes 
against notorious troublemaker 
Dylan Maxwell (Jimmy Tatro, 
“22 Jump Street”), leading to 
his expulsion. The new Netflix 
mockumentary show, “American 
Vandal” — released in September 
2017 — follows a high school 
journalist, 
Peter 
Maldonado 
(Tyler Alvarez, “Orange is the 
New Black”), in his compelling, 
cinematic quest to prove Maxwell 
innocent. Through the successes 
of Maldonado’s journalistic and 

directorial efforts, the case of 
who drew the dicks becomes a 
nationwide social media frenzy, 
with hundreds of thousands of 
people talking about Maxwell. 
The infectious nature of the 
documentary within the show’s 
fictional 
public 
mirrors 
the 
captivating effect that the story 
and series itself have on its real-life 
viewers.
With its steady climactic twists 
and realistic characters — crafted 
through authentic dialogue and 
logical 
intrinsic 
motivations 
— “American Vandal” delivers 
an-edge-of-your-seat 
viewing 
experience. Although shows in 
the high school realm have the 

tendency to err on the side of 
“Degrassi,” “American Vandal” 
delivers a much more serious, true-
crime feel. “American Vandal” 
capitalizes on the satire through its 
mockumentary-style filmmaking. 
If the crime had been swapped 
with one less humorous — say, there 
was a dead body discovered instead 
— this series would completely play 
out like a true crime piece. At the 
end of the day, this line the series 
cleverly maneuvers between light 
and dark is the factor that really 
sells “American Vandal” as the one-
day binge series that it is.

Media Editor

2. “American Vandal”

In April of 2016, Donald J. 
Trump was the presumed winner 
of the Republican presidential 
nomination and a TV adaptation 
of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, 
“The Handmaid’s Tale,” had just 
been ordered. Though seemingly 
unrelated events, “The Handmaid’s 
Tale” became a vital commentary 
on the shocking nature of our future 
president and a cautionary tale of 
what could happen if we accept 
such disregard for our rights and 
laws without revolt. Just in case you 
were completely cut off from pop 
culture, the Internet or society as 

a whole for the better part of 2017, 
here is some background: “The 
Handmaid’s Tale” is a dystopian 
story in which an oppressive 
patriarchal group reigns over a 
distorted version of the United 
States. Women are stripped of their 
rights and any who are fertile are 
considered handmaids, forced to 
reproduce to preserve the lineage 
of the government.
It is a horrifying tale, yet one that 
reflects on the web of manipulation, 
power 
and 
abuse 
that 
has 
become all too familiar in our 
contemporary headlines. The show 

could not have come at a better 
time and, unfortunately, its motifs 
and messages become increasingly 
more relevant as our time under 
this administration progresses. 
Despite the handmaids’ ultimate 
rebellion at the end of the season, 
there is an ever-looming promise 
that the war is never won. Still, 
at the core there is always hope

3. “The Handmaid’s Tale”

Ah, “Stranger Things.” The 
Duffer 
Brothers’s 
(“Hidden”) 
gorgeous, 
hilarious 
and 
terrifying ’80s homage burst onto 
the scene this year in its second 
season. Chances are high that 
the series — which permeated 
through, 
well, 
pretty 
much 
every element of pop culture 
from 
mid-October 
through 
November — was something 
you breezed through on Netflix 
during a cozy, bed-confined 
week around Halloween. The 
fact that “Stranger Things 2” 
became such a quintessential 
aspect of our collective Fall 2017 
consciousness speaks to the 

series quality and its downright 
lovable cast.
Led 
by 
15-year-old 
Finn 
Wolfhard (“It”), the show’s cast 
consistently wooed us with their 
chemistry and sheer charm. 
Starring 
alongside 
Wolfhard 
are his longtime pals Gaten 
Matarazzo (“The Blacklist”) and 
Caleb McLaughlin (“The New 
Edition Story”), both picking up 
right where the show’s debut 
season left off to win over our 
hearts again. Only this time, 
the show’s talented cast does 
it against tougher odds, as 
“Stranger Things 2”’s second 
season strikes a markedly darker 

and more frightening tone.
Our 
nightmares 
of 
the 
so-dubbed “shadow monster” 
and 
a 
demonically-possessed 
Noah 
Schnapp 
(“Bridge 
of 
Spies”) may fade, but our love 
of this charismatic, nostalgic 
group of characters will never 
subside. In a year ravaged by 
chaos stemming from polarizing 
figures, “Stranger Things 2” 
provided 
us 
with 
a 
much-
needed sense of calm through 
its universally acclaimed and 
appreciated cast.

5. “Stranger Things 2”

However 
disappointing 
HBO’s summer Sundays were 
in the “Game of Thrones” 
department this year, season 
two of “Insecure” made up 
for it. The fabulous Issa Rae 
— creator, actress, writer and 
personal style icon — came 
back with more confidence 
and attitude than ever before 
in a glorious trainwreck of bad 
decisions. Not uncommon for 
comedies, 
“Insecure” 
came 
into its own in its sophomore 
season. The show found its 
groove with key additions to 

the 
sparkling 
cast, 
honing 
in on a unique voice in the 
writers’ room and soaring the 
storytelling to an all-time high. 
Reeling from a break-up, Issa 
tries to do the “adult thing” in 
season two, but she’s a little 
more damaged than we last 
saw her. Painfully prone to 
overthinking (then again, who 
isn’t?) and saturated with the 
raw awkwardness that initially 
intrigued viewers, our leading 
lady shines as she struggles 
to 
figure 
her 
directionally 
challenged self out. This was 

a season of failed hoe-tations, 
rapping 
mirror 
pep 
talks 
and putting out some not-so-
metaphorical fires. But through 
all 
the 
cringe, 
“Insecure” 
quickly climbed up the ranks of 
2017’s best series and promised 
to keep delivering incredibly 
heartfelt, funny and relatable 
stories. Rae has curated a voice 
that is able to cut through the 
clutter and there’s no telling 
how far she can go.

Top Episodes In Review

“Master of None” has this 
sublime quality; it effortlessly acts 
as a storyteller of the deeply-rooted 
battles of our generation. The 
Emmy-winning “Thanksgiving,” 
written by Aziz Ansari (“Parks 
and Recreation”) and Lena Waithe 
(“Dear White People”), shares 
a 
coming-out 
story 
spanning 
decades 
of 
family 
dinners, 
earnestly based on Waithe’s own 
adolescence. In this 30-minute 
masterpiece, Denise’s (Waithe) 
exploration of her true identity 
is at first repressed by delicate 
pink dresses and a conservative 
Black family instilling in her the 
“proper” way to dress and behave. 

But with her best friend Dev’s 
(Ansari) unending support and 
pop culture’s increasing liberation, 
Denise progressively embraces all 
that she is and prompts her family 
to do the same.
What makes this portrayal all 
the more monumental is the raw 
racial and cultural representation 
necessary 
for 
the 
gradual 
processing of Denise’s revelation. 
Throughout the episode, Dev 
and Denise — two minorities — 
sit anxiously in Denise’s room, 
hopeful once again that Denise’s 
identity will not cause any strain 
on this year’s Thanksgiving. In a 
similar way, Denise’s impassioned 

mother remains skeptical towards 
Denise’s sexuality — not out of 
hostility, but out of concern that 
being a black female lesbian 
will triple the odds against her 
daughter.
Ultimately, this episode tops 
the list because of its honesty 
— in acting, social commentary 
and intimate undertones. With 
a nuanced narration of a real-
life occurrence, “Thanksgiving” 
invites us to journey along the path 
of self-evolution in search of a point 
where things are largely alright.

Despite what meets the eye, 
“Big Little Lies” is far more than 
just another HBO thriller with a 
star-studded cast and high levels of 
intrigue. Nuanced and emotionally 
commanding, the series reminds 
us that even those with seemingly 
ordinary lives can be privy to some 
pretty groundbreaking secrets.
Centered 
around 
a 
recent 
murder 
investigation 
in 
the 
innocuous town of Monterey, Cali. 
“Big Little Lies” leaves viewers on 
the edge of their seats for a majority 
of the season — neither the murder 
victim nor the perpetrator is 
revealed until the very last episode. 

The whodunit suspense is one of the 
series’s greatest strengths, along 
with the fierce, snide and albeit 
sometimes satirically humorous 
portrayals of three rich, white, 
suburban mothers who are not as 
unassuming as they may seem. 
The leading ladies — Madeline 
(Reese 
Witherspoon, 
“Legally 
Blonde”), Celeste (Nicole Kidman, 
“Lion”) 
and 
Jane 
(Shailene 
Woodley, “The Secret Life of the 
American Teenager”) — captivate 
with 
tenacious 
performances 
and dynamic portrayals of some 
weighty social issues including 
domestic abuse, rape and deception. 

Those real-life controversies are 
never glossed over or abridged, 
shaping 
the 
series 
into 
an 
influential commentary on gender 
bias and female politics. The series 
features a highly comprehensive 
and intimate soundtrack, which 
compliments each dramatic twist 
and turn soulfully and sincerely. 
With an unapologetic, deep-seated 
and highly impassioned storyline 
and character lineup, “Big Little 
Lies” is most definitely one series to 
invest your time and conscience in.

2. “The Book of Nora,”
“The Leftovers”

Every TV show deserves a 
happy ending — even one as grim 
and ominous as “The Leftovers.” 
Thankfully, 
co-creators 
Damon 
Lindelof (“Lost”) and Tom Perrotta 
(“Little Children”) delivered a finale 
for “The Leftovers” that was equal 
parts immensely satisfying and 
devastating. A clear-eyed, near-
perfect culmination to a clear-eyed, 
near-perfect season, “The Book 
of Nora” felt transcendent in its 
writing, acting, direction, music and 
cinematography. Not only did it offer 
some plausible answers to the many 
ambiguous existential questions 
posed throughout the series, but it 
also gave the show’s arguably most 

afflicted character Nora Durst 
(Carrie Coon, “The Post”) a hopeful, 
redemptive sendoff.
So many striking, poignant 
moments 
populated 
the 
last 
episode: Nora and her brother 
Matt 
(Christopher 
Eccleston, 
“Doctor Who”) exchanging their 
final goodbye, Nora methodically 
sauntering toward the dimension-
switching portal, a reunited older 
Nora and Kevin (Justin Theroux, 
“The Lego Ninjago Movie”) slow-
dancing to Otis Redding’s somber 
“I’ve Got Dreams to Remember.” 
But nothing came remotely close 
to the last ten haunting minutes, 
in which Nora gives a monologue 

worthy of a standing ovation. She 
presents Kevin with an explanation 
to the show’s core calamity: What 
happened to the two percent 
of the world’s population that 
disappeared? 
Kevin, 
though 
deeply heartbroken from years of 
separation, reaffirms her story with 
three beautiful words: “I believe 
you.”

DAMN. finds Kendrick Lamar 
running 
circles 
around 
his 
competition after the critical and 
commercial successes of Good 
Kid, M.A.A.D. City and To Pimp 
A Butterfly, but it doesn’t always 
feel like a victory lap. While 
songs like “ELEMENT.” and 
“LOYALTY.” find Kendrick at his 
most arrogant, other tracks like 
“YAH.” and “FEEL.” partially 
dispel this illusion of confidence, 
instead portraying his stardom 
through a lens of paranoia and 
bitterness. The sonic palette is 

correspondingly bleak as well 
as 
somewhat 
anachronistic: 
Motown-esque Fender bass tones 
and old-school tags by Kid Capri 
mingle with hard-hitting 808s and 
rolling hi-hats. There is a subtle 
anxiety pervading the album, 
created 
by 
dissonant 
chords, 
paranoid lyrics and the ominous 
recurring motif of a sound best 
described as a distorted flock of 
birds, reminiscent of the looped 
tape effects found in “Tomorrow 
Never Knows.” Kendrick’s lyricism 
is as sharp as ever, every song 
packed with clever and insightful 
bars, particularly on “FEAR.” and 
“XXX” where the storytelling 

and social commentary in both 
are among his very best. Even 
the less substantive tracks such 
as “LOVE.” and “GOD.” are well-
made and absorbing, providing 
some necessary respite from the 
weighty topics of the adjacent 
songs. 
Part 
of 
what 
makes 
this work so compelling is the 
ambiguity: 
Kendrick 
weaves 
together egotism and self-defeat, 
dissonance and brightness, to 
create an album that feels less 
like a celebration and more like a 
contemplation.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

There is a bizarre, nebulous 
space between 18 and 21 that 
sometimes gets called “19 and 
20,” but is more aptly titled 
“melodrama.” 
New 
Zealand 
pop queen Lorde spins her 
sophomore album from the 
heartache and hormones that 
dominate that space, and holds 
a mirror and a microscope up 
to the world my peers and I are 
moving through.
Lorde 
is 
my 
peer, 
too. 
And 
while 
celebrities 
age 
prematurely, 
our 
emotional 
experiences 
run 
parallel 
to 
each 
other. 
Her 
first 
album Pure Heroine defined 

my high school years. But 
that’s an easier moment to 
define. On Melodrama Lorde 
dances through post-teenage 
wreckage: broken glass on a 
floor sticky with champagne 
bought with a fake ID. She 
parses wisdom from the tragedy 
that is growing up and realizing 
that every heartbreak isn’t the 
end of the world and every new 
love isn’t its beginning.
Lorde 
traverses 
this 
glittering 
world, 
but 
never 
seems to wholly belong to it. 
She asks, early on: “But what 
will we do when we’re sober?” 
a question that looms over 

the rest of the album. What 
happens when the party ends 
— “lights are on and they’ve 
gone home, but who am I?” she 
asks later. What happens when 
the album ends and she’s no 
longer “young” or “new?” What 
happens when the novelty of 
novelty wears off?
Melodrama is everything a 
20-year-old is: anxious, poetic, 
vulnerable 
and 
alive 
with 
beauty. This isn’t just the album 
of the year; it’s the album of a 
generation.

If Top Dawg Entertainment 
is a world-class university — 
with 
label 
superstar/professor 
Kendrick Lamar integrating his 
encyclopedic knowledge of all 
things historical and cultural into 
each one of his lectures, er, songs — 
SZA is its blossoming student, now 
equipped with new knowledge 
and building on previous lessons 
(see: 2014 studio debut Z). This 
scholarly tinge informs Ctrl, a 

genre-crossing release that really is 
as sonically malleable as it is sheer 
listening pleasure. As with any 
album of this year-defining caliber 
there are those characteristically 
breathtaking moments: When the 
singer boasts of “secretly banging 
your homeboy” before admitting 
to an unwelcome dependence over 
a lush guitar on “Supermodel,” 
for example, and also on “Broken 
Clocks” with a soulful punch 

(“Can’t beat ‘em just join the 
party / I don’t wanna don’t need 
nobody”). SZA ultimately gives 
a deeply personal lecture where 
her insecurities and strengths 
meet elegant, layered production; 
a 
stream-of-consciousness 
broadcasted as gorgeous poetry in 
(R&B) motion.

From the opening chords of 
Process, there’s nowhere else to 
go but within. They’re plucked 
from 
some 
strange 
universe 
that 
Sampha 
has 
carefully 
constructed, where the entirety 
of the album exists. It’s where 
synths, strings and keys not only 
play off one another, but mimic 
each other. “Plastic 100C,” a slow 
moving anthem about the fear of 

climax, opens up this world; what 
unfolds over ten tracks is a kind 
of fragmented dance, urgent at 
times, languid at others.
So much of Process is about 
relationships, 
both 
romantic 
and familial. Sampha’s mother, 
Binty Sisay, passed away in 2015, 
and though largely unspoken 
(at least explicitly) he seems to 
navigate that grief through his 

other relationships. His mother 
sometimes sits behind the “you” in 
these lyrics, and Sampha spins out 
this delicate web of love and loss 
with beautiful vocals. On Process, 
Sampha finally perfects the R&B 
palette he has curated for years, 
with greatness only hinted at.

Forgive 
those 
who 
thought american dream was 
underwhelming, or even stale, 
at first. Initially it could have 
felt as if the group failed to 
veer from its trademark album 
format of catharsis: Each song 
an at least six-minute post-punk 
curation of doggedly burnt out 
emotion. Slowly, however, the 
album has a way of seeping 
in. There’s the nuance of each 
synthy progression on “how do 

you sleep”; the nu-disco overload 
on “tonite”; James Murphy’s 
hollowed-out vocals in “american 
dream.” Such a diverse collection 
of sounds backs up Murphy’s 
characteristically 
dense-yet-
concise lyricism. “oh baby” is 
arguably the gem of the album, 
a warm croon replete with 
an 
indescribably 
’90s 
sound 
and 
emotionally-weaponized 
melodies. In LCD’s universe, 
time is merely a construct both 

in literal track length and full 
listening 
absorption. 
With 
american dream, too, it may take 
a while. But like in any measure 
of musical temporality, somehow, 
eventually, you’re going to need 
to hear whatever Murphy says 
(even without realizing as much 
beforehand), and you’re probably 
going to cry as you do.

If you would have told 2010 
Styles fans that he would go 
on to launch a solo career full 
of floral Gucci suits, a heavy 
coating of tattoos and a lyrical 
comparison between a cocaine-
filled nose and a tunnel full of 
traffic, they would be hesitant 

to believe you. Yet, all of these 
things have come to fruition 
quite wonderfully. Harry Styles 
is simultaneously tender and 
exclamatory; 
Styles 
peacocks 
as a young, Jagger-esque rocker 
while lamenting and praising 
genuine affection. Aware of his 

audience’s and his own aging, 
he includes blushingly-intimate 
details without being crass (See:

Since the release of his 
mixtape in 2009, Tyler, The 
Creator 
has 
established 
himself as a master storyteller, 
fabricating a cohesive fairytale 
that spans across three albums. 
Bastard, 
Goblin 
and 
Wolf 
introduce us to a variety of 
Tyler’s alter-egos: Wolf Haley, 
Dr. TC, Tron Cat and Sam, 
among others. His characters 
exist within the fictional world 
of Camp Flog Gnaw, dropping 
in and out of therapy sessions 
and asylum visits. Everything 
is a little unhinged, including 
the storyline, which seems to 
be purposely made difficult to 
follow. Every time you think 

you’re starting to understand the 
motive behind all the madness, 
you get lost in the chaos of non-
linear timelines, songs that just 
don’t make sense and blunt 
rhymes wrapped in barbed wire.
Flower Boy is different.
Tyler, 
The 
Creator 
deconstructs the entire world he 
spent nearly eight years building. 
From this wreckage, Flower 
Boy unfurls: a multicolored 
dreamscape 
rich 
with 
expressive vocals and flowing 
background 
instrumentals. 
Individual tracks are wistful 
reflections on everything from 
old relationships to burgeoning 
sexualities. They flow together 

effortlessly, creating an intimate 
connectivity that is unmatched 
in any of his previous work. This 
is Tyler, The Creator at his most 
sincere, trading in subversion for 
vulnerability. Multiple personas 
and convoluted narratives are 
replaced 
by 
straightforward 
acceptance: “Tell these black 
kids they could be who they are 
/ Dye your hair blue, shit, I’ll do 
it too.” 
Understanding the necessity 
for growth, he allows himself 
to bloom: Flower boy T finally 
found his wings.

Big Fish Theory is a futuristic 
wet dream. It’s polished synths 
and 
sleek 
electronic 
beats 
bring to mind the basement of 
a Tron-esque club. Presiding 
over the entire scene, Vince 
Staples acts as the nihilistic 
neon demon. His flow is almost 
manic, a relentless frenzy of 
energy that illuminates the 
glitch among the glamour of 
rap stardom. Individual tracks 

are hybrids that mesh rave 
and hip hop to create dark 
bangers: social commentary 
on the dance floor. “Crabs in 
a Bucket” and “Party People” 
especially revealing the fame 
that weighs heavy on Staples’s 
shoulders. Amid the lacquered 
shine of expensive cars and 
stacks of cash, stereotypes 
and 
expectations 
of 
what 
a young African American 

man should be creep next 
to 
disillusionment 
and 
hopelessness.
There is no reserve as Vince 
Staples dives into Big Fish 
Theory. He embraces his own 
cynicism, traversing the bleak 
landscape with ease, leaving 
behind a mirage of pulsing 
tempos 
and 
slick 
rhymes; 
destitution 
disguised 
as 
a 
macabre celebration.

Ah, the state of the UK in 2017: 
The reality of Brexit settles in, 
and Fabric has its license revoked. 
Dark times in London called for 
a dark album from Peckham’s 
preeminent Lonely Boy, Archy 
Marshall.
More so than any other record 
this year, The OOZ is dense; 
at times the album is difficult 
to finish, but it always finds a 
way to immerse you, almost 
hypnotically, to 
the absolute 
fringes of the world it creates. It 

spans from Barcelona, the home 
of Archy’s mysterious girlfriend, 
to Bermondsey and the corridors 
of Le Marais.
Though the album is a bit 
of a globetrotter with regard 
to influences and references, it 
mainly takes place in the extreme 
depths of Archy’s insecurities, 
anxieties, 
doubts 
and 
fears. 
The listening experience is like 
evaporating into a cloud of smoke, 
only to be pulled back into the 
guck of a world you’re trying to 

escape.
Although 
this 
is 
familiar 
territory for a King Krule album, 
sonically it deviates into jazz 
fusion and much harder rock 
sounds than we’ve heard from 
Archy before. He screams a bit, 
but he also cries, growls and 
mumbles. It’s clear that he’s still 
figuring things out, and that likely 
won’t end when the year does too.

On

Stephen 
Bruner’s 
seemingly 
improvised 
melodies 
and 
signature falsetto have a certain 
mesmerizing 
charm. 
When 

blended with his undeniably 
groovy beats and bass lines, they 
create a sound that is just left of 
center. For 51 minutes, you are 
in Thundercat’s ethereal and 
almost nonsensical world, as he 
meows in the background of “A 
Fan’s Mail (Tron Song Suite II)” 
and asks where he left his phone 

on “A Bus in These Streets.” 
As a bonus, you run into yacht

The Power Center serves as the 
home for multiple organizations 
and functions on campus, such 
as the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, the University Musical 
Society, the musical theatre troupe 
MUSKET and more. A building 
acutely aware of its geometrical 
design, 
the 
Power 
Center’s 
architectural layout demands to be 
noticed: From the outside mirrored 
walls and the solid concrete spiral 

staircases to the malleability of the 
stage’s orientation, you’re hit with 
imagination and creativity the 
moment you enter. Although the 
theater is designed to be spacious 
and grand (fitting a little over 1,300 
seats), every seat is no more than 80 
feet away from the stage, drawing 
in each audience member for an 
intimate 
experience. 
Dazzling 
performances — like SMTD’s “The 
Little Mermaid,” performed by 

the musical theatre department, 
and UMS’s “Written in Water,” 
performed by Ragamala Dance 
Company — left their mark on

2. The Michigan Theater

The Michigan Theater has long 
been the jewel of Ann Arbor. The 
theater is perfectly marketed for a 
university town, since it features 
films and hosts live performances. 
Established in 1928, its appeal is 
everlasting. Stepping through the 
front doors feels like entering a 

new world, full of vaulted ceilings 
and rich gold embroidery lining 
the walls. Two grand sweeping 
staircases — which double as a 
classic photo-op station — beckon 
guests to explore the extravagant 
balcony level. The theater is a 
breath of fresh air, but the location 

itself is a blend between antique 
and modern. While the interior 
may seem like it belongs in another 
century, the bustle of downtown 
Ann Arbor lies right outside its 
walls.

in 
1913 
as 
an 
acoustically 
perfect environment, the goal 
being that a pin being dropped 
on the stage could be heard 
by every seat. I really enjoy 

attending performances at the 
Hill Auditorium by students at 
the School of Music, Theatre &

Michigan “M” in the center) and 
the picturesque exterior give an 
exciting and sophisticated feel 
to every performance.

The Midwest has commonly

creativity that’s ready to show

have served as the venue for 

some of my favorite memories 
here in Ann Arbor. They’re 
often made up of some of the 
most unique and passionate acts 
in the area, with shows ranging 
from local punk bands to three 
hour performances of a Philip 
Glass opera. Their informal 
nature fosters a supportive 
environment 
for 
artists 
to 

share a piece of themselves 
with audiences in a way that 
feels completely devoid of any 
commercial motive. There’s no 
place where you’ll experience 
such raw emotion and intimacy 
like a house show.

5. The Ark

I love The Ark. I’m shouting 
it from every ice-laden, snow-
ridden rooftop in Ann Arbor, 
and I’m screaming it at you. 
The club seats roughly 400, 
and it’s an oasis of folk music. 
With round tables in the front 
and rows of seating further 
back, there’s no bad place to 
land. It’s the kind of space that 
lends itself to being fallen in 

love with. In 2017 alone, The 
Ark hosted the likes of Billy 
Bragg, Stephen Kellogg and 
Howie Day. It balances big 
names 
with 
up-and-comers, 
welcoming new artists with the 
same fearlessness that drives 
the soul of hip-swaying, feet-
stomping roots music. There’s 
an attainability inherent in the 
air there. The nature of the 

venue strips each performance 
down to the barest of bones; 
it’s just us and the artist, every 
time. It’s cozy and loving, and 
it’s a stunning manifestation of 
my favorite aspect of folk music: 
overwhelming intimacy oozing 
from a wild, wild heart.

6. Lydia Mendelssohn

Tucked into the side of the 
Michigan League, the Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theatre is like 
the charming little grandpa 
in the family of Ann Arbor 
venues. Stepping into the solid-
oak-paneled theatre feels like 
stepping into an older era — 
after all, it was designed in 

1929. The few renovations have 
hardly changed its character. 
2017 
saw 
performances 
such as the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance’s “One Hit 
Wonder,” Rude Mechanicals’ 
“Equus” 
and 
a 
variety 
of 
student and community group 
performances. Like the League, 
there is a certain elegance 
and charm permanently hung 
in the air. It is one of the few 

theaters in the United States to 
have a curved wall at the back 
of the stage, creating unique 
uses of lighting and sound. 
With only 644 seats, The Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theatre delivers 
an intimate experience that 
makes you feel like you’re at a 
private show.

7. Literati

Coffee and books: the two 
things that make any place feel 
warm and cozy. Located on E. 
Washington in downtown Ann 
Arbor, Literati Bookstore has 
both. Literati has brought a 
number of renowned authors 
and poets — like Roxane Gay, 
Tiya Miles and Alise Alousi — 
for readings. They have also 
partnered with the Zell Visiting 
Writers Series, which was made 

possible through Janey Lack, the 
University of Michigan Museum 
of Art, the Department of 
English Language & Literature 
and the Office of the Vice 
President, to help bring writers 
from all over North America and 
abroad to host public readings. 
You can grab a cup of coffee, 
listen to readings from your 
favorite authors and then head 
downstairs to stock up on books. 

Not in the mood for a reading? 
Musicians 
also 
perform 
at 
Literati, and the bookstore’s 
cozy vibes create an intimate 
audience experience. Regardless 
of the type of performance it is 
hosting, Literati has the heart, 
warmth, 
coffee 
and 
books 
needed for a relaxing time.

8. Zingerman’s Greyline

Walking into Zingerman’s 
Greyline, one feels as though 
they have left campus and 

arrived 
somewhere 
almost 
futuristic — somewhere you 
might 
find 
yourself 
on 
a 

weeknight, floating around the 
room with a champagne flute in 
hand without worrying about 

9. The Streets of Ann

There is so much art to behold 
just by walking around the 
University’s campus and the 
city of Ann Arbor. Art is in the 
small downtown shops selling 
handcrafted goods. Art is in 
the crafty fairy doors that are 
hidden all around the city. There 

is live music at your fingertips 
from the man in a wolf mask 
who walks around, jamming 
with his violin to groups of 
people banging on upside down 
buckets. The University campus 
contains buildings with a variety 
of thoughtful and interesting 
architectural designs. If finding 
art in nature is your thing, the 
Arboretum is the prime place to 

appreciate art its most natural 
form. The diverse audience is 
made up of families, onlookers 
and students from all over 
Michigan. Just step outside of 
your dorm and immerse yourself 
in the art that Ann Arbor 
provides free of charge.

10. UMMA

The 10th best venue goes 
to the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art, the University’s 
space to share its art collection 
and my space to take a study 
break. While most works on and 
within the walls of this public art 
museum are static, they entertain 

through visual stimulation. By 
exhibiting a myriad of artistic 
styles 
and 
movements, 
the 
UMMA’s collection is a spectacle 
of diverse visual representation. 
The UMMA is also home to 
temporary 
exhibitions 
and 
special events. The UMMA’s 

website 
features 
information 
on their current happenings, 
including movie nights at the 
museum, after-hours viewings 
and, recently, a chocolate tasting.

paper

or 
coming 
exams. I attended a reading 
at the Greyline on a Monday 
evening in late November. I felt 
incredibly underdressed in my 
thrifted jeans and my Converse, 
with the soles peeling away. 
But after sitting in the dimly 
lit Greyline for a while, I might 
as well have been wearing a 
shimmering 
cocktail 
dress 

and stilettos. In other words, 
the glamour of the venue 
itself is pleasantly consuming. 
Illuminated 
by 
low-hanging

the Greyline’s sleek hardwood 
floors

gray 
walls 
are 
juxtaposed against the shelf-
lined walls of Ann Arbor’s 
bookstores with a long, stocked 
bar replacing the usual coffee 

counter. The Greyline hosts a 
variety of both personal and 
public events, from wedding 
rehearsals and bar mitzvahs to 
concerts and readings. If you 
want to escape college and feign 
sophistication for a night like I 
did, attend a Greyline event.

1. Betroffenheit

Watching this performance tore 
my heart out of my body, placing it 
in a vulnerable light where I was 
faced with my own deep sorrows 
of loss, the kind I tend to conceal. 
It was that beautiful kind of 
sadness, where I couldn’t help but 
stare in awe at a man who poured 
out his desolation into divine, 
moving art. Jonathan Young, 
co-founder and artistic director of 
Electric Company Theatre, wrote 

and starred in “Betroffenheit.” 
His daughter died in a house 
fire, while he survived, and 
Young choose to publicly express 
that personal trauma through 
a blend of theatrics and dance. 
It is the greatest performance 
I have ever witnessed. Voices 
were everywhere; they seemed 
to be attached to the walls, to the 
doors and to the fixtures. The five 
other dancers elevated elements 

of 
madness 
and 
feelings 
of 
isolation with intricate costumes, 
schizophrenic personalities and 
absolutely stunning dance. With 
a thousand layers, this piece got 
inside my head. “Betroffenheit” is 
profound because it drew out raw 
emotion that will stay with me for 
years to come.

2. The NY Philharmonic’s 

This past November, the 
New 
York 
Philharmonic 
performed 
Gustav 
Mahler’s 
“Symphony No. 5” in Hill 
Auditorium as a part of their 
weekend-long 
orchestral 
residency. It seemed as if all of 
Ann Arbor showed up to watch 
these world-class musicians 
perform the work of one of 
the greatest composers of all 
time. Mahler’s symphonies are 
known for their lengthiness 
and 
unpredictability. 
However, time seemed to fly 

by while sitting and hearing 
the 
glorious 
sounds 
that 
resonated on the stage before 
me. 
The 
unpredictability 
of 
Mahler’s 
music 
comes 
from his attempt to describe 
the highs and lows of life 
through 
music, 
challenging 
the 
conductor, 
musicians 
and 
audience 
members 
to 
embark on their own personal 
emotional journey throughout 
the symphony. I found myself 
really getting into the emotions 
that 
the 
music 
conveyed 

and ended up sobbing the 
entire time — a response that 
surprised me. The conductor, 
Jaap van Zweden, masterfully 
shaped each phrase of music 
with his entire body, keeping 
strong communication with 
the orchestra. Van Zweden’s 
energy was contagious, and 
the 
audience 
was 
at 
the 
edge of their seats the entire 
performance.

3. DakhaBrakha

Like all the best pieces of my 
life, Ukrainian folk-punkers 
DakhaBrakha first fell into my 
world via an NPR Music Tiny 
Desk Concert. It’s 13 minutes 
and 57 seconds of otherworldly 
rhythms, unbelievable artistry 
and woolen hats. I, of course, 
was in love. I didn’t really 
understand it — and I still 
don’t really understand it — 
but I loved it nonetheless. 
The 
quartet 
came 
to 
the 

Michigan 
Theater 
back 
in 
March, and I threw myself at 
the opportunity to go because 
I wanted to live in the feeling 
of suspension their Tiny Desk 
gave me. The group is so 
intensely 
mesmerizing. 
It’s 
hard to describe how acutely 
their sound resonates because 
everything about them — from 
their look to their instruments 
to the language they sing in 
— is foreign to me. Yet, they 

still cut deep. The show was 
entrancing. DakhaBrakha is a 
testament to the universality 
of music, using traditional 
Ukrainian 
folklore 
as 
a 

launching point to navigate 
the sounds of our world. It 
was a meditative moment in a 
semester of chaos, and it was 
one I’ll always love.

4. Hussain, CrossCurrents

In 
early 
November, 
UMS 
welcomed 
Indian 
classical music legend Zakir 
Hussain 
to 
the 
Michigan 
Theater 
to 
perform 
with 
his newest musical venture, 
CrossCurrents. CrossCurrents, 
which 
includes 
famous 
bassist Dave Holland, is a 
musical 
group 
that 
blends 
Indian 
classical 
and 
jazz 
music together. Growing up 
surrounded by Indian classical 

music, 
I 
was 
pleasantly 
surprised at the jazz influence 
CrossCurrents 
brought 
to 
such a traditional genre. As 
a 
University 
student 
who 
witnessed 
many 
racially 
charged incidents throughout 
the semester, this message of 
co-existing 
peacefully 
gave 
me hope. From the racial 
slurs written in the West 
Quad dorms to the current 
protests 
over 
Richard 

Spencer’s possible appearance 
on campus, the student body 
needed 
CrossCurrents’s 
reminder that, though we may 
be incredibly different, we’re 
all united as students of the 
same university.

PIRELLI’S

The Pirelli corporation has 
been 
publishing 
artistically-
inclined calendars since 1964, 
but none have made a statement 
as great as their 2018 project, 
unveiled in November of 2017. 
Shot by the legendary Tim 
Walker, “The Cal” features an 

all-Black cast in an adaptation 
of 
“Alice’s 
Adventures 
in 
Wonderland.” TV personality 
RuPaul makes for a spellbinding 
Queen of Hearts, model Duckie 
Thot stole our hearts as Alice and 
the aforementioned Slick Woods 
portrays an eerily convincing 

Mad Hatter. If it’s not obvious 
yet, this is about far more than 
a calendar: In 2017, Pirelli 
reminded the fashion industry 
that minorities have every right 
to their own beautiful narratives.

In October, Dutch designer 
Liselore Frowijn threw Paris 
Fashion Week for a loop: Not 
only was her Spring Summer 
2018 show bereft of celebrities, 
but the rising star used the 
runway 
as 
an 
opportunity 
for social commentary. The 

20-look production celebrated 
Mexican culture with vibrant 
patterns, 
billowy, 
climate-
appropriate 
separates 
and 
frequent 
reference 
to 
the 
nation’s flag. Stoic faces of 
models boasted phrases like 
“Batalla” and “No Wall,” an 

obvious dig at the Trump 
administration. That’s a bold 
move for a talent as fresh as 
Frowijn, who earned her BA in 
2013, and it certainly paid off. 
Look out for this one.

3. Fenty Beauty release

It’s still unclear how Virgil 
Abloh evolved from a Kanye 
West background player into 
an A-list fashion influencer in 
just two short years. However, 
it couldn’t be any clearer that 
2017 belonged to him: After 
designing 
limited 
edition 
concert merchandise for Travis 
Scott, 
guest-speaking 
at 
a 
series of Ivy League colleges 
(including 
Harvard) 
and 
watching his staple clothing 
label (OFF-WHITE) be anointed 

a GQ-darling, Abloh linked with 
Nike for a collaborative sneaker 
collection. Unsurprisingly, the 
resulting 
kicks 
became 
the 
year’s most-hyped.
Virgil Abloh’s “The Ten” 
collection was first teased on 
Twitter, where the creative 
director spent months sharing 
photographs of his re-designed 
Air Jordan 1s prior to their 
official release. In the shots, 
many of which became viral 
hits, he’s shown scribbling well-

known nicknames (such as “Air 
La Flame” for Travis Scott) on 
pairs’ rubber soles — a subtle 
sign of customization which 
doubled as organic marketing. 
When the collection finally 
dropped though, it featured 
remixes of nine other iconic 
Nike classics from Abloh and 
sold out instantly, crashing the 
brand’s SNKRS release platform 
in the process.

4. “The Ten” collection

All in a year’s work for 
Slick 
motherf*cking 
Woods. 
Nick Remsen’s profile of Slick 
Woods, an androgynous, gap-
toothed model who this year 
rose to fame, is short and sweet, 
but its mere existence speaks 
wonders. In 2017, it became 
possible 
for 
norm-defying 

beauties like Woods to grace 
fashion’s 
most 
prestigious 
runways, to be featured in 
global 
makeup 
campaigns 
(more on Fenty Beauty above) 
and, put bluntly, to be in Vogue 
(double entendre intended). A 
bald-headed, tomboyish woman 
of color has been dubbed “the 

Face of the New American 
Style” by the world’s most 
respected fashion publication. 
Together, Remsen and Woods 
have left a permanent wound 
on the face of conventional 
fashion.

5. Woods’s Vogue editorial

Lil Uzi Vert had a wildly 
successful year — one that 
few artists in history have 
matched blow-for-blow. After 
opening for The Weeknd on 
Starboy’s European tour, the 
Philadelphia-raised 
crooner 
enjoyed a summer residency 
atop Billboard charts (with 
breakout hit “XO Tour Llif3” 
spending 39 weeks on the 
scoreboard) and even earned 
a number one album (via his 
major-label debut, Luv Is Rage 
2). Still though, the most talked-
about aspect of Uzi’s viral fame 
this year was his obscure, 
often 
close-to-the-edge 

style. His rise to prominence 
perfectly coincides with the 
reemergence 
of 
emo-trendy 
and, as a rainbow-haired sad-
boy who’s effectively paved 
his own lane in hip hop, Uzi is 
a figurehead of the movement.
Known 
for 
crossing 
boundaries in song, dress and 
syntax, Lil Uzi Vert hardly 
deviated from his norm when 
he posed for a now-famous 
photograph while donning a 
pink, striped Valentino blouse, 
a white-gold, spiked choker 
and a Guoyard bag over his 
shoulder. Of course, the photo 
made waves online, evolving 

into an iconic meme within 
the hip-hop community and 
earning threads of backlash 
from veteran emcees (who 
argued that Uzi looked soft). 
Yet, for youthful streetwear 
nerds 
and 
fashionable 
rap 
fans alike, its surrounding 
conversations only cemented 
Lil Uzi Vert’s position as the 
most influential newbie in the 
game. Of course 50 Cent was 
jealous — where the fuck is he?

For most of us, 2017 was a year 
synonymous with the beginning 
of Trump’s presidency. Starting 
in January, we said goodbye 
to the age of President Obama 
and hello to the madness that 
the White House has been ever 
since, which has arguably done 
more than anything else to color 

the course of this year. For this 
reason, the most important 
book published in 2017 has 
been Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “We 
Were Eight Years in Power: An 
American Tragedy,” a collection 
of eight essays published over the 
course of Obama’s eight years of 
presidency. 
Coates 
combines 
compelling personal narrative 
with impeccable research to 
paint a comprehensive picture 
of American life from all angles 

— from slavery to politics to 
entertainment, from the very 
beginnings 
of 
America 
to 
its current state. One of the 
most 
multifaceted, 
cohesive 
and well-researched books of 
recent years, it is also one of 
the most significant, especially 
during a time when history 
and facts themselves are being 
questioned.

2. “Hunger: A Memoir of 
(My) Body” by Roxane 
Gay

“Hunger: A Memoir of (My) 
Body” is a thought-provoking, 
moving and transformational 
book 
that 
challenges 
the 
assumptions of physicality and 
reveals 
the 
deeply 
intimate 
relationship between psyche and 
body. Roxane Gay, the incredibly 
sharp and resonant author of 
“Bad Feminist” and “Difficult 
Women,” explores the struggles 

of being fat in a fat-phobic world, 
the irrevocably damaging effects 
of trauma and the dynamics 
of constructing a reality. Gay’s 
memoir reads quickly but leaves 
a lasting impact. With her frank 
and pointed writing, Gay brings 
attention to the physicality of 
everything — the body, food, 
skin, movement — and forces 
you to think about the tactility 
of occupying space. The book 
is not a story of one woman’s 
triumph over her demons and 
finding peace, but is instead 

a gripping attempt to wrestle 
the representation of unruly 
bodies from a prejudice culture 
and to reclaim the narrative. 
Roxane 
Gay 
criticizes 
the 
hypocrisies of culture that push 
women to criticize themselves 
while affirming her legitimacy 
as a woman and as a person. 
“Hunger” is one that sticks with 
you and forces you to look at the 
world around you with careful 
perspective.
—Sydney Cohen, Daily Arts 
Writer
3. “Gather the Daughters” 
by Jennie Melamed

“Gather the Daughters” is one 
of the best debut novels I’ve read in 
the past few years. Perfect for any 
lovers of current timely and classic 
favorites — “The Handmaid’s Tale” 
in particular, and “The Giver” as 
well — it tells the tale of a world in 
which women, once they reach a 
certain age, have one final summer 
of freedom left before they are to 
be married off and have children. 
Except the generation of youth 

that serves as the focal point of 
this story are getting restless, and 
asking questions that the older 
men in charge of the community 
would prefer remain unspoken. 
The future of these girls and their 
unprecedented rebellion hinges 
on qualities that are as ferocious 
as they are delicate: the fierceness 
of a young girl’s love of freedom, 
another’s hunger for knowledge 
and a third’s tragic desire to just 

get out. It is a heartbreaking 
story conveyed in gorgeous, often 
startlingly poetic prose. I can’t 
remember the last time I sat down 
and read a book in one sitting 
without intending to — but “Gather 
the Daughters” almost requires it.
—Sophia Kaufman, Daily Arts 
Writer
