More 
than 
60 
students 
gathered 
in 
the 
Michigan 
League for the second-ever 
Coming Out Speak Out, an 
open-mic event for the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
The event was hosted by 
Stonewall 
Democrats, 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
issue 
committee 
of College Democrats at the 
University of Michigan. The 
first Coming Out Speak Out was 
hosted in 2017.
To begin, LSA senior Colleen 
Grogan and LSA freshman Neil 

Jain, 
Stonewall 
Democrats 
co-chairs, 
introduced 
the 
event, explaining it was a space 
for members of the LGBTQ+ 
community to voice their story 
and stand in solidarity with 
those who have had different 
coming-out 
stories. 
Grogan 
and Jain emphasized there is 
no generic coming-out story 
and expressed coming out is a 
lifelong process. 
Many speakers spoke about 
experiencing 
confusion 
and 
guilt as they came to understand 
their 
identities. 
Several 
discussed doubts they faced 
in feeling they had to conform 

to expectations of gender and 
sexuality in a heteronormative 
society. 
Others 
spoke 
of 
believing they were straight 
because they did not fit common 
LGBTQ+ stereotypes.
In 
sharing 
their 
coming 
out 
experiences, 
some 
described 
positive 
reactions 
and expressed gratitude for 
supportive 
communities. 
Others 
recalled 
negative 
aspects, saying they were not 
yet 
comfortable 
discussing 
their sexuality with certain 
family members and friends. 
Some 
voiced 
they 
received 
skepticism, disbelief and denial 

from family and friends. Several 
expressed 
suffering 
mental 
health issues such as depression 
and 
experiencing 
suicidal 
thoughts. Others shared they 
faced verbal and physical abuse 
from family and experienced 
threats of being put in the foster 
system and homelessness.
A few speakers highlighted 
the importance of recognizing 
the intersection of sexuality 
and race, explaining individuals 
belonging to LGBTQ+ and POC 
communities experience higher 
rates of mental illness and 
violence. 

Despite the triple wash process 
all produce goes through before 
serving, which includes a food-
safe rinse to kill bacteria and other 
harmful pathogens in addition to 
two more rinses with water, some 
students have still reported finding 
bugs in MDining salads at multiple 
dining hall locations this year.
MDining serves about 25,000 
meals a day and nearly 4 million 
every year, according to Keith 

Soster, 
director 
of 
student 
engagement, sustainability, training 
and development for University of 
Michigan Dining. He said with such 
a large volume of service, incidents 
like these do happen on occasion.
“I don’t know that we could 
totally ever eliminate this kind of 
situation,” Soster said. “But we do 
everything we can to prevent it. 
When they do happen, we want to 
know so we can understand how an 
object made it on a plate, and work 
to limit future exposures.”
Nursing 
sophomore 
Maddie 

Jones described two incidents 
last year in which she discovered 
undesirable items in her salad at 
both Mary Markley and Mosher-
Jordan Dining halls.
“The first time when I found the 
bug it was in Markley, and I made 
my salad and it was all good, and I 
started eating it and then I noticed 
something in there that didn’t look 
right,” Jones said. “So, I took it out, 
and my roommate at the time was 
like, ‘That’s definitely a bug,’ and I 
was like, ‘That’s definitely a bug.’ So 
I just took it out and threw it away.”

Jones did not submit any 
complaint to MDining for the 
first incident. Later that year, she 
experienced a similar incident at 
Mosher-Jordan, where she found a 
piece of metal in her salad.
“But then I found another thing 
in my salad at MoJo,” Jones said. 
“I was eating my salad, and I was 
chewing on my beet and something 
crunched on my teeth and I was 
like, ‘What is that?’ so I spit it out 
and it was a chunk of metal so I was 
like, ‘That’s not right.’”
Publishers Weekly named Literati 
Bookstore its 2019 Bookstore of the 
Year on March 28.
Literati 
was 
announced 
in 
February as one of five finalists 
for 
the 
award, 
which 
honors 
independent bookstores nominated 
by those in the book industry. The 
award will be presented to owners 
Hilary and Michael Gustafson at 
BookExpo on May 30 in New York 
City. 
Literati recently celebrated its six-
year anniversary of being in business 
— it opened on March 31, 2013. Since 
then, the independent bookstore has 
made a name for itself with its public 
typewriter, cafe and the number of 
literary events it hosts.
Literati 
co-owner 
Hilary 
Gustafson said the nomination and 
award came as a surprise to the 
relatively new business owners.
“We’ve only been a business 
for six years, and typically the 
Publishers Weekly Bookstore of 
the Year is given to bookstores that 
have been in the business a long 
time, although some of the other 
bookstores nominated were also 
new,” Hilary Gustafson said.

As the term of the Eighth Assembly 
comes to a close, The Daily sat down 
with the former Central Student 
Government president, vice president 
and communications director to 
discuss their experience in CSG over 
the 2018-19 school year.
This school year’s executive team 
led CSG to pursue many different 
initiatives, pieces of legislation and 
events across campus.
MVision’s platform included more 
meetings on North Campus and 
monthly town hall meetings, making 
the Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center more accessible, 
and increasing minority identity 
representation on campus and more.
The 
administration 
worked 
to improve student health and 
wellness through adjustments to 
the MDining policies by listing all 
of the ingredients in foods, as well 
as placing EpiPens in each dining 
hall and training employees on how 
to properly use them. The team also 
introduced CSG’s inaugural Mental 
Health Awareness Week in March 
which included a town hall, a Diag 
day and the implementation of health 
and wellness vending machines.

Maize & Blue Cupboard 
announced 
Tuesday 
that 
they will be expanding their 
operation 
and 
relocating 
to a permanent space on 
Central Campus. Following 
this week’s soft opening, an 
official unveiling of the new 
location at Betsy Barbour 
Residence Hall will occur 
this upcoming fall.
Maize & Blue Cupboard, 
an initiative of the Office 
of the Vice President for 
Student Life, began as a 
student-run 
organization. 
The 
organization 
initially 
hosted monthly distribution 
days, offering produce and 
groceries to students in need 
and worked from the Trotter 
Multicultural Center. After 
Trotter began undergoing 
construction, relocating to a 
building right next to Betsy 
Barbour, students working 
at Maize & Blue Cupboard 

moved to the basement of the 
Michigan League. 
The 
expansion 
of 
the 
organization and its adoption 
through 
the 
Office 
of 
Student Life will allow for 
the cupboard to distribute 
daily instead of monthly, 
Monday through Friday from 
3 p.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. In 
addition to grocery items 
and produce, the new Maize 
& Blue Cupboard will also 
offer 
cookware, 
toiletries 
and 
support 
services 
for 
students. According to the 
organization’s Maize Pages 
website, their food options 
for students are sourced 
from local food bank Food 
Gatherers and the Campus 
Farm, and unused food is 
then donated to Community 
Action 
Network 
of 
Washtenaw County.
Alex Bryan is the manager 
of the U-M Sustainable Food 
Program and a staff member 
at Maize & Blue Cupboard.

On March 25, President 
Donald Trump expressed 
support for the Great Lakes 
Restoration 
Initiative 
to be fully funded in a 
Grand Rapids rally. This 
turnaround came after an 
initial 90 percent budget cut 
for the initiative as outlined 
in the 2020 budget plan for 
congressional approval just 
weeks before. In the 2020 
budget plan released March 
11, Trump proposed to cut 
the 
$300-million 
Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative 
by $270 million.
During the Grand Rapids 
rally last Thursday, Trump 
said he would get funding 
for the initiative because he 
supports the Great Lakes.
“I 
support 
the 
Great 
Lakes,” Trump said. “Always 
have. They are beautiful. 
They are big, very deep. 

Record deepness, right? And 
I’m going to get, in honor of 
my friends, full funding of 
$300 million for the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative, 
which you’ve been trying to 
get for over 30 years.” 
The 
Great 
Lakes 
Restoration Initiative was 
started in 2010 and received 
$475 million in 2010 at 
the peak of the program’s 
funding. According to the 
Initiative’s website, GLRI 
has 
received 
a 
funding 
amount of at least $283.5 
million annually until 2017.
In 
the 
president’s 
initial 2020 budget for the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency, the 2020 budget 
for GLRI is reduced to $30 
million, a 90-percent cut of 
$270 million from its $300 
million budget for 2019.
Michigan 
state 
Rep. 
Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 
condemned 
the 
initial 
budget cut for GLRI and 
Special Olympics in a phone 

interview with The Daily. 
“The 
budget 
(Trump) 
proposed 
is 
full 
of 
problems,” Rabhi said. “Not 
just the elimination of the 

Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative monies, but 
also the reduction of 
the 
Special 
Olympics 
funds.”
Despite so, a fully 
funded GLRI bodes well 
for bipartisan support 
of 
environmental 
protection 
but 
still 
attracts worries from 
Democrats.
LSA sophomore Kate 
Nachazel, vice president 
of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, said she 
feels 
the 
change 
is 
positive.
“I’m glad he is doing 
that,” 
Nachazel 
said. 
“I think that the right 
people 
in 
the 
right 
positions put pressure 
on him.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Camille 
Mancuso, 
communications 

director for the University’s 
chapter 
of 
College 
Democrats, 
has 
concerns 
about the attitude of Trump’s 
administration 
towards 
environmental 
protection 
despite the change.
“Regardless 
that 
the 
initiative being fully funded, 
we should really be focused 
on the fact that it was 
proposed to be defunded 
altogether,” Mancuso said. 
“This 
is 
the 
president’s 
third 
attempt 
to 
cut 
funding for the Great Lakes, 
which really shows that 
protecting the environment 
… is not a priority of this 
administration.”
Rabhi agreed that despite 
a 
positive 
change 
for 
environmental 
protection, 
long-term 
decisions 
affecting 
many 
are 
not 
thoroughly considered by 
the administration. 
“While I am glad that we 
can use more funding for 
the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative, 
I 
think 
his 
inability 
to 
comprehend 
what is important and what 
isn’t,” Rabhi said.
Rabhi 
attributed 
the 
swift budget cut to the 
insufficiency of a smaller 
tax in supporting the federal 
budget.
“There (are) cuts now 
that we have to make for the 
federal budget because of 
his short-sighted tax policy 
which granted millions of 
dollars of tax breaks for 
businesses on the backs of 
our federal budget,” Rabhi 
said.
According to Rabhi, both 
the initial budget cut and the 
recovery of full funding for 
the initiative has disrupted 
people’s livelihoods.
“People’s 
jobs 
are 
on 
the line here,” Rabhi said. 
“There 
(are) 
so 
many 
implications 
this 
small, 
tiny amount of money has 
huge implications, not just 
for Michigan but all across 
Great Lake states.”

LSA freshman Ben Rosenfeld on his story “Ann Arbor-based law center 
sues AG, state civil rights department”:

“Interviewing one of the leaders of the AFLC provided a lot of background information 
on the case, but the most interesting person I got to interview was probably state 
Representative Yousef Rabhi. He was able to provide a lot of information about the 
legislative measures state government takes to work against organizations like the ones 
classified as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also gave an interesting 
perspective on the role of the Department of Civil Rights in Michigan politics and how they 
work with the Attorney General and other government officials to combat discrimination 
against minority communities.”

“

President had originally proposed to cut budget from $300 million by $270 million


Bryan identified the need for 
accessible food for students, 
especially because a full-service 
grocery store is not located 
on the University’s campus. 
Bryan 
explained 
that 
the 
Food Sustainability Program 
teamed up with organizations 
like the Office of Student Life, 
Wolverine Wellness, the Office 
of Financial Aid and CAPS to 
form a task force and determine 
the need behind this initiative.
“There is need here, there are 
students that are going hungry, 
there are students that are 
surviving on ramen at best, that 
aren’t getting the full nutrition 
that they need,” Bryan said. 

“We put together a working 
group … to make sure that we 
got everyone on the same page 
that we identified, ‘Yes, there’s 
a need.’”
Now that Student Life has 
taken on this project and 
worked to curate a permanent 
location 
on 
campus, 
the 
students behind Maize & Blue 
Cupboard 
are 
working 
to 
establish a new organization, 
temporarily 
named 
“MBCB 
Consulting,” 
that 
ensures 
students are still a part of the 
process. 
Business sophomore Spencer 
Baxter joined Maize & Blue 
Cupboard in 2018 and served 
as vice president of operations 
this past fall. He was recently 
elected co-president. Baxter 
explained Student Life’s role 
in taking over the student 

organization left the current 
students to determine their 
next 
steps 
on 
their 
own, 
which will include smaller 
projects focusing on increasing 
engagement and limiting food 
waste within the new facility. 
Instead of student volunteers, 
Student Life will be hiring full-
time employees to oversee the 
organization
“That kind of defeats our 
purpose because we were sort 
of a less committal organization 
… there are some people that 
would want to volunteer but not 
volunteer if someone is getting 
paid next to them,” Baxter 
said. “We want (to create) a 
part-time paid staff position to 
incentivize people to come.”
Food insecurity has been 
a widely discussed topic on 
campus in recent years, noting 

the lack of food resources 
available on and near campus. 
According to a study from 
2016, 41.4 percent of Michigan 
students had low to very low 
food security. Campus groups 
like Maize & Blue Cupboard 
and Student Food Co. have 
been working to combat the 
issue 
for 
years, 
garnering 
support from Central Student 
Government and other student 
organizations.
CSG has implemented an 
Emergency Meal Fund program 
for 
students, 
which 
offers 
meal swipes to food-insecure 
students while they explore 
further options with the Dean 
of Students Office. Additionally, 
former CSG President Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy senior, 
signed an executive order to 
establish the Food Insecurity 

and Campus Affordability Task 
Force, which went into effect 
this past fall.
LSA 
sophomore 
Ben 
Gerstein, 
incoming 
Central 
Student Government president, 
also 
noted 
past 
initiatives 
through CSG to help combat 
food insecurity for students and 
explained that the incoming 
assembly will work to prioritize 
this issue for the next school 
year.
“I 
think 
it’s 
a 
great 
development for the student 
body here, and it’s going to be 
a consistent strong resource 
for students,” Gerstein said. 
“In Ann Arbor and on campus, 
food is extremely expensive, 
and being able to have that 
in a pretty good location for 
students to access whenever 
they need … is really important.”

PREMIE RE OF “THE NOTE BOOK S” BY DA VINCI

The Chamber Choir and Imani Winds group conducted by Eugene Rogers performs the chamber setting premiere of The Notebooks by Leonardo Da Vinci, composed by Jocelyn 
Hagen, in the University of Michigan Museum of Art Thursday evening.

Hilary Gustafson said she was 
excited to see Literati’s name on 
the nominations list among so 
many bookstores that are “doing 
innovative things in the industry.” 
She attributed the win to the 
bookstore’s staff over all other 
factors.
“Their 
expertise 
and 
commitment to the written word 
and love for books has really made 
our business what it is today,” 
Hilary Gustafson said.
Gina Balibrera Amyx, creative 
programs and floor manager at 
Literati, also emphasized Literati’s 
booksellers as a major factor in the 
bookstore’s success. Some of these 
employees previously worked at 
Borders, which was previously the 
main bookstore in downtown Ann 

Arbor before it closed in 2011.
“We have people who spent 
decades working at Borders … and 
we have a lot of poets and fiction 
writers on staff from the U-M 
Helen Zell writing program — so 
MFA students and graduates of 
that program — so people who are 
deeply immersed in that world and 
so they bring a lot of passion to the 
business as well,” Balibrera said.
Literati’s staff has grown from 
seven booksellers to 27 in the 
six years it has been in business. 
According to Hilary Gustafson, 
booksellers 
stock 
the 
shelves 
according 
to 
what 
they 
see 
customers looking for on a daily 
basis.
Hilary Gustafson also cited 
Literati’s social media presence and 
community engagement as factors 
that have led to its success in its 
short time in business.
“We do pride ourselves on being 

community focused in events and 
book clubs,” Hilary Gustafson said. 
“We have over 150 events a year, 
both in store and off site, and most 
of them are free and open to the 
public.”
One of Literati’s most well-
known 
factors 
is 
the 
public 
typewriter in its basement on which 
visitors are free to leave notes. 
Hilary Gustafson said her husband 
and co-owner, Michael Gustafson, 
reads through the notes left on the 
typewriter every day.
“The 
public 
typewriter 
really invites the community to 
participate,” Hilary Gustafson said. 
“A lot of good writing comes out of 
it.” 
Michael Gustafson published 
a collection of notes left on the 
typewriter last year with co-editor 
Oliver Uberti.
Those 
who 
frequent 
the 
bookstore were not surprised that 

the store was awarded Bookstore of 
the Year.
The coffee shop on the top floor 
of Literati attracts students as a 
place to study or write. According 
to 
Hilary 
Gustafson, 
many 
MFA students use it as a space 
to write. The Gustafsons invite 
visiting authors to leave notes of 
encouragement to such writers on 
the “author wall,” which is crowded 
with their writing.
The cafe does not only attract 
English graduate students. Many 
undergraduates use the space to 
work as well.
LSA freshman Julia Kravchenko 
said she and a group of friends spend 
about three to four hours working 
in the coffee shop at Literati every 
Thursday.
“Literati is special because it’s 
very quaint,” Kravchenko said. “It 
has a phenomenal atmosphere that’s 
the textbook definition of a coffee 

shop you would see in a movie or 
read about in a book, plus the music 
is always different each time we go 
depending on who’s working.”
Kravchenko said she thinks the 
Bookstore of the Year award was 
well deserved.
“From what I’ve browsed in 
their bookstore, it has a really wide 
variation of genres and books for a 
small store,” Kravchenko said. “I 
once found a Frankenstein Pride 
and Prejudice crossover work and I 
sort of lost it because I didn’t think 
that existed.”
University alum Sierra Bain said 
she spent a lot of time at Literati 
while earning her undergraduate 
degree.
“I feel like it’s a no brainer that it 
was named Bookstore of the Year,” 
Bain said. “I like the coffee shop 
upstairs, and I like the light in the 
space and how it overlooks our little 
town.”

Jones submitted a comment 
card to MDining explaining the 
second incident.
She expressed her displeasure 
with the encounters and suggested 
MDining work more carefully to 
maintain the quality control of 
their products.
“I’m assuming it’s because they 
mass-produce 
everything, 
but 
that’s still gross,” she said. “They 
could still, like, quality control it.”
Rachel Christensen, food and 
occupational safety manager for 
MDining, explained in an email 
to The Daily that these types of 
incidents most often happen with 
products that grow out of the 
ground.
“Where a product grows in the 
ground, for instance, can increase 
the likelihood of exposure to dirts, 
bugs, rocks and other undesirable 
objects,” she wrote. “We never 
want to serve a product that 
contains foreign objects.”
LSA freshman Nora Sharba 
described an incident just this 
past February in which her friend 
found a cricket in their salad at 
South Quad Dining Hall.
“I came back from the bathroom 
and all my friends were standing 
around our table at South Quad 
freaking out, so I got over there and 
at first I couldn’t see it because it 
blended in with the salad,” Sharba 
said. “I didn’t know what the big 
deal was, but then I saw the cricket 
in there and my jaw dropped.”
Sharba said the discovery has 
prevented her from eating salad at 
the dining halls since.
“I wasn’t completely surprised 
because dining hall food can be 
made pretty carelessly when you’re 
trying to feed so many people in a 
short amount of time,” she said. “I 
definitely lost my appetite though 
and didn’t eat in the dining hall for 
a few days — I haven’t had a salad 
ever since.” 
She was disappointed with 
the apparent lack of care from 
MDining in maintaining quality 
assurance over their ingredients.
“I 
think 
that 
the 
lettuce 
ingredients should be washed 
more carefully because anyone 
who was paying attention would 
have noticed something like that, 
and it’s pretty unsettling to find 
bugs in your food,” Sharba said.
Soster said MDining was not 
aware of these recent incidents, 
and has continued to increase the 
frequency with which they train 
their staff on inspecting their 
products.
“It’s 
unfortunate 
that 
the 
student 
didn’t 
feel 
it 
was 
appropriate to ask for a manager 
because we want to take care of 
stuff on the spot,” he said. “What 
I’d like to communicate is: If 
there’s an issue, let us know right 
then and there.”
He emphasized students are 
highly encouraged to approach 
MDining with the issue so it can 
be handled appropriately.
“When you approach me in a 
dining hall and go, ‘Here’s what I 
found,’ I can go right back to the 
kitchen and go, ‘Where did this 
come from?’ and then contact the 
vendor,” he said. “The emphasis 
I’m placing here is we want to fix 
it. We’ll fix it right on the spot. 
It’s frustrating, it’s unfortunate 
and we just want the community 
to know that we keep the highest 
standards, and we don’t want that 
to happen either.”
MDining Marketing Manager 
Kelly Guralewski also highlighted 
MDining’s readiness to resolve 
such issues.
“Even 
if 
a 
student 
isn’t 
comfortable 
or 
a 
guest 
isn’t 
comfortable with going to a 
manager, they can write on the 
comment card, email us, send us a 
message on social media,” she said. 
“At the end of the day if they do 
post it for their friends to see, then 
we’re still going to comment and 
try to make it right.”
Soster 
explained 
when 
situations like these happen, it is 
best to report them immediately 
so MDining can then contact 
the correct vendor who supplied 
the product and resolve the 
issue. Christensen echoed this in 
MDining’s statement.
“Our first line of defense, and 
what is critical to our quality 
control, is that we only purchase 
food from approved, reputable 
suppliers,” she wrote. “Any incident 
of this nature is immediately 
reported to the vendor to ensure 
they are held accountable. This 
ensures our vendors are aware 
of an issue, so they can review 
their food production process and 
adjust if needed to increase safety 
precautions.” 

The administration also focused 
efforts 
on 
preventing 
sexual 
misconduct on campus through 
initiatives 
like 
the 
Survivor 
Empowerment Fund and events 
like “Empowering Survivors: A 
Forum on Sexual Misconduct 
Policy.”
The Survivor Empowerment 
Fund provides finances to groups 
on campus striving to educate the 
University of Michigan on sexual 
assault prevention and aiming to 
empower survivors. These funds 
are allocated toward costs for 
bringing guest speakers and general 
programming.
The two-hour forum comprised 
of professional presentations on 
issues related to sexual misconduct, 
such as the Sixth Circuit Court 
Ruling and the proposed Title 

IX policy. Prior to the event, CSG 
worked with other departments to 
spread knowledge on how to write 
comments and notify the necessary 
parties as a result of sexual 
misconduct.
The executive team further 
worked on bettering inclusivity 
and equity on campus, specifically 
through 
the 
announcement 
of the Narratives, Equity and 
Transformation Plan.
“The program, led by CSG 
executive diversity officer Lloyd 
Lyons, aims to provide student 
organizations 
with 
a 
clear, 
individualized overview of key 
areas of improvement as well as a 
toolkit to help those organizations 
achieve their full potential,” a CSG 
information release stated.
Former CSG President Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy senior, 
spoke about how valuable he 
believes the NET plan is for all 
students and organizations on 

campus.
“The first thing many students 
do on this campus to make this 
big campus small is join a student 
organization, and until we can 
improve the inclusivity of the 
culture mentality behind student 
organizations … we’re not actually 
going to see the improvements on 
the DEI front,” Greene said.
In regards to housing, the 
executive team introduced the 
Housing Management Guide last 
semester — now the most visited 
page on the CSG website according 
to Greene — which provides 
students with specific information 
to assist them in finding the best 
housing options to fit their needs 
off-campus.
LSA junior Isabel Baer, the 
former 
CSG 
vice 
president, 
believes one of the largest impacts 
they had on campus was through 
the Big Ten Voting Challenge. CSG 
pursued social media campaigns, 

made 
two 
public 
service 
announcement videos on voting 
and contributed to the Buses to 
Ballots initiative to help students 
get to and from polling stations. 
In 2018, voter turnout at the polls 
in the University campus precincts 
tripled in comparison to the 2014 
voter turnout. 
“I think (the turnout rate) 
proves that it’s not that students 
don’t want to vote and are actively 
not, it’s more a feeling of not 
knowing where to go or not caring, 
especially with the midterms,” 
Baer said. “I think that was really 
important moving into a general 
election that’s happening and the 
first time Michigan is considered 
a purple state officially, so … I 
hope students can continue and 
obviously will continue as well to 
do that promoting.”
In 
addition 
to 
the 
larger 
initiatives 
the 
administration 
pursued, former Communications 

Director Lydia Barry, an LSA 
senior, 
believes 
the 
smaller 
initiatives they accomplished are 
just as important, specifically ones 
in which CSG had one-on-one 
interactions with students, such as 
the recent Division of Public Safety 
and Security event registering 
students for emergency alerts.
“I think every time a student 
interacts with us in that way or we 
just want a suggestion from them 
or just want to give them breakfast 
during finals or something, I 
think that leaves a really positive 
impression with them,” Barry said. 
“I’ve seen students who you know, 
come to get a snack or something, 
but then they end up saying ‘I 
have this idea’ … So I think CSG 
being that middleman is really 
important.”

In an interview with The 
Daily after the event, College 
Democrats Chair Ruby Schneider, 
an LSA junior, discussed the 
importance of creating a space for 
the LGBTQ+ community to share 

their experiences.
“It’s really important to provide 
a space for queer folks on campus 
to be able to share out, hear from 
others and be comfortable with 
the identities and where they’re 
at in their coming-out process,” 
Schneider said.
Grogan expressed she was 
pleased 
with 
the 
audience 
participation and story diversity.

“I was very pleased with the 
participation of people in the 
audience,” Grogan said. “We 
weren’t sure people would be 
willing to put themselves in 
this really vulnerable position, 
but people were willing and 
able. And I think we had a lot of 
diversity of voices, in experience 
and background, which is really 
important when talking about 

coming out since there is not one 
coming-out experience.”
LSA 
senior 
Kallie 
Bernas, 
former co-chair of Stonewall 
Democrats, 
expressed 
she 
is 
happy to see how the event has 
grown since the first time it was 
hosted.
“It’s really interested to see 
how things have grown over 
time,” Bernas said. “We were 

pulling teeth at the first one, and 
people were a little bit timid … 
Hearing one person talking about 
how the first event inspired him 
to come out was really powerful. 
And it just felt like the atmosphere 
in that room was like family, 
everyone could relate to bits and 
pieces of the story, so I felt really 
strengthened and really proud to 
be a member of this community.”

T

his week, following 
outcry related to the 
Christchurch 
mass 
shooting 
in 
New 
Zealand, Facebook 
announced 
it 
would ban white 
nationalist 
and 
white 
separatist 
content 
from 
its 
platform. 
The 
gunman 
livestreamed 
part 
of the attack on 
Facebook, 
which 
resulted in copies 
of 
the 
video 
spreading 
across major social media 
platforms. 
The 
questions 
provoked by the attack — how 
did the gunman radicalize? 
Why has it proven so hard 
for 
companies 
to 
handle 
his 
video 
and 
manifesto? 
— 
have 
highlighted 
the 
content moderation problem 
social media platforms have 
struggled 
with 
for 
years. 
Namely: How do you protect 
the ideals of free speech while 
preventing the spread of vile 
and dangerous content?
Some believe the solution 
is a matter of incentives and 
advocate for holding social 
media companies accountable 
for the content that appears on 
their platforms. For example, 
lawmakers 
in 
Germany 
passed a law that mandates 
social media companies delete 
offending posts within 24 
hours of being notified or risk 
heavy fines. Others advocate 
for the internet as a bastion 
of free speech, like when 
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey 
referred to his platform as the 
“free speech wing of the free 
speech party.”
Neither 
of 
these 
approaches 
is 
without 
drawbacks. 
Holding 
companies accountable for 
their 
content 
may 
stifle 
competition 
and 
restrict 
free speech. The overhead of 
complying with regulations, 
as well as the risk of litigation 
from disgruntled users, could 
cripple startups who lack 
the resources of large social 
media platforms to deal with 
such threats. Furthermore, 
regulation may incentivize 
companies 
to 
“delete 
in 
doubt,” 
or 
remove 
any 
borderline 
content, 
which 
may have a chilling effect on 
speech.
But unrestricted speech 
is not the answer either. 
A 
number 
of 
examples 
demonstrate 
the 
serious 
consequences of a laissez-
faire approach to this issue. 
For instance, see the role 
of 
misinformation 
in 
the 
2016 election, the spread of 

conspiracy theories leading 
to Pizzagate and the use of 
Facebook to incite violence 
against 
Rohingya 
Muslims.
A more active 
strategy has taken 
hold in recent years 
due to outcry over 
events such as those 
mentioned 
above. 
Facebook 
has 
30,000 
employees 
dedicated to safety 
and 
security, 
15,000 
of 
whom 
are content moderators, and 
a number of countries are 
considering online content 
regulations. 
But 
they 
are 
focusing on a problem which 
may be intractable. Facebook 
moderates billions of posts 
per week in more than 100 
different languages. YouTube 
sees the equivalent of 65 
years of video uploaded each 
day. That scale would be a 
perfect application for the 
automation 
capabilities 
of 
Silicon Valley, if it weren’t 
trying to resolve the nuances 
of human discourse. Though 
artificial 
intelligence 
has 
made significant strides in 
identifying specific content 
such as nudity and graphic 
violence, the subtleties and 
cultural contexts of human 
language 
are 
not 
easily 
automated, 
leaving 
social 
media platforms and their 
content moderation armies 
playing a global game of 
whack-a-mole.
This 
active 
approach 
focuses 
on 
the 
content 
moderation 
machine 
itself 
— the human moderators, 
AI 
systems 
and 
policies 
employed by social media 
companies to address content 
on their platforms. However, 
this misses the root cause 
of the issue: social media’s 
design. The desire to create 
a 
“global 
community,” 
as 
Facebook puts it, as well as 
the emphasis on virality and 
relevancy, as defined by the 
tech companies, are the real 
culprits. Users are inundated 
with content that is meant 
to grab their attention — 
and hold it — for as long as 
possible. This goal to lead 
users down a rabbit hole often 
leads 
to 
recommendations 
of more and more extreme 
material. 
A 
Wall 
Street 
Journal 
investigation 
of 
YouTube found that users 
who 
watched 
relatively 
mainstream 
news 
sources 
were 
often 
fed 
extreme 
video recommendations on 
a wide variety of topics. For 
example, if you searched for 
information on the flu vaccine, 

you 
were 
recommended 
anti-vaccination 
conspiracy 
videos.
Additionally, 
the 
emphasis on virality leads to 
features that quickly amplify 
and 
legitimize 
content. 
WhatsApp’s popular message 
forwarding 
feature 
allows 
users to forward messages 
without any indication of their 
origin, making it seem as if a 
message which may have been 
shared thousands of times is 
coming directly from a close 
friend or family member. This 
feature was recently limited 
after lynchings in India were 
fueled by rumors spread on 
the service.
WhatsApp isn’t the only 
platform that has disabled 
functionality in response to 
tragedy. 
YouTube 
disabled 
part of their search feature 
following the Christchurch 
shooting, and Facebook was 
ordered offline temporarily 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
after 
false 
rumors led to riots against 
Muslims. This tendency to 
disable functionality during 
crises is telling. When push 
comes to shove, the platforms 
themselves 
acknowledge 
that 
only 
by 
addressing 
problematic features will the 
problem be solved.
This is not to say a 
redesign of these platforms 
would 
be 
simple. 
Putting 
aside companies’ incentives 
to maintain the status quo and 
the legislative hurdles that 
would accompany any sort 
of intense regulation, there 
are 
legitimate 
arguments 
to be made for preserving 
features 
currently 
under 
fire. The same features that 
cause outcry now inspired 
optimism following the Arab 
Spring. A successful solution 
could 
not 
merely 
limit 
functionality, as that would 
ignore the capacity for good 
of these technologies.
Fundamental 
questions 
about free speech and the role 
of technology in society are 
being left to conference rooms 
in Silicon Valley, creating 
a 
situation 
where 
human 
moderators and imperfect AI 
systems implement a global 
censorship regime dictated 
by a handful of corporations. 
The solution for this problem 
is unclear, but whatever it is 
will require reckoning with 
the 
massive 
influence 
of 
social media platforms. The 
model of these sites ensures 
they 
don’t 
simply 
mirror 
society — they change it.

A

s 
Women’s 
History 
Month 
came 
to 
an 
end, I spent some time 
reflecting 
on 
the 
positive 
female influences that have 
shaped me into the woman I 
am today. Mentors, friends and 
teachers came to mind. But 
most importantly, the woman 
who has had the largest role in 
my development as a woman is 
none other than my mother.
The person I am today – the 
girl who became an outspoken 
woman, graduated high school 
at the top of her class, played 
sports and excelled at her 
extracurriculars and made it 
to a prestigious university – 
would not have been possible 
without 
the 
presence 
and 
influence 
of 
my 
powerful 
immigrant mother.
From waking up with me 
at 5:30 a.m. every morning 
to driving me 20 minutes to 
my bus stop so I could go to a 
better high school to bringing 
plates of fruit to my room every 
night while I was studying, 
my mother has been right by 
my side through it all. She has 
been committed to putting her 
children 
before 
everything 
and putting her education and 
her career on hold for us.
While reflecting on my 
mother’s selflessness that has 
allowed me to succeed, I have 
come to realize that this idea 
of sacrifice is a common theme 
among Arab Americans and 
those from other immigrant 
communities. Even though 
every 
mother 
puts 
her 
children first, the drive of 
the 
immigrant 
mother 
is 
unique. They recognize the 
struggles and the restrictions 
of 
their 
homelands 
and 
channel 
their 
passion 
for 
change 
through 
their 
children.
My parents left Syria to give 
us the life they couldn’t have 
for themselves: a life where 
if you work hard enough, you 

can achieve something for 
yourself. A life where speaking 
out won’t put your life at risk. 
They recognized this sacrifice 
and decided to pour their 
hearts and souls into their 
children living the lives they 
wished they could have had.
A 
recent 
study 
found 
the “immigrant paradox” – 
the idea that the children 
of 
immigrants 
are 
more 
successful than both their 
parents and than those with 
American-born parents from 
similar backgrounds — to be 
true. The study also concluded 
that the immigrant status of 
parents did have an “indirect 
effect” on the success of 
their children. Because of 
the need to break barriers 
and 
achieve 
the 
highest 
accomplishments 
possible, 
immigrant parents tend to set 
high expectations for their 
children’s achievements. With 
many immigrant mothers more 
likely to be stay-at-home moms, 
the reality is that this type of 
achievement-focused mentality 
starts in the home under the 
influence of the mother. 
Part of the reason that 
first-generation 
Americans 
tend to have a greater sense 
of drive instilled within them 
is the exposure to more than 
one 
culture 
and 
mentality. 
The 
cultural 
diversity 
that 
first-generation 
Americans 
share allows them to take 
cultural 
tools 
from 
both 
sides of their identities to 
be the best possible version 
of 
themselves. 
To 
many 
immigrants like my parents, 
hard 
work 
and 
dedication 
mean that you will always 
find 
success. 
My 
parents 
were never scared to hit rock 
bottom because they knew 
life could always get better. 
The optimism and dedication 
that my mother instilled in 
me 
translated 
to 
working 
harder 
to 
move 
forward, 

something characteristic to 
many children of immigrants. 
Coming home from a bad day at 
school or after not doing well 
on a test, I knew I would have 
my mother there for me to lift 
my spirits and reinvigorate my 
devotion to success.
Many immigrant women, 
including my mother, come 
from 
a 
background 
where 
their likelihood to succeed, 
specifically as women, was 
even further restrained. When 
children of immigrants tell the 
stories of their parents coming 
to America and trailblazing 
a new life, it is often a tale of 
the courageous father with 
the mother on the sideline. 
The story is seldom told of the 
woman at home inspiring her 
children – from comforting 
them when they didn’t fit in 
with the other kids at school 
to staying up all night helping 
them with their science fair 
projects. While my mother 
putting me and my dreams 
before her own comes from a 
deep love for her children, she 
also simply couldn’t achieve 
her own goals because of the 
lack of opportunity she faced.
The 
American 
dream 
has special significance to 
the immigrant mother. The 
American dream, generally, is 
the ideal that all Americans 
can have equal opportunities 
for 
success. 
To 
her, 
the 
American dream is seeing her 
daughters do whatever she 
wishes she could have done 
at their age. The American 
dream is seeing her sons break 
generational traditions of toxic 
masculinity. 
The 
American 
dream is starting to raise 
families that make them proud.
And 
to 
my 
immigrant 
mother, I have not forgotten 
you and I have not forgotten all 
that you have done for me.

Size acceptance vs. body positivity
L

aying in my pajamas on 
a lazy Friday morning, 
perusing the feed in 
my 
borrowed 
Hulu 
account, 
I 
begin 
streaming the first 
episode of “Shrill.” 
In this new comedy, 
we follow the life of 
Annie, a writer who 
juggles her work and 
relationships 
with 
friends, parents and 
love 
interests. 
But 
this show is different 
from other female-
centered 
comedies 
because 
… (drum roll please) Annie is 
fat! Did we finally just get a 
mainstream narrative of a fat 
woman where it is not entirely 
about her fatness? Yes, yes we 
did. A show where the main 
plot is not about the fact that 
she hates herself, that she is 
the punchline of the joke or 
that she is struggling to lose 
weight, but where she is just 
a fat woman living her life. It 
feels like a small victory and 
sign that things could change 
in our culture. 
In 
three 
quick 
hours, 
I 
binged 
watched 
all 
six 
episodes and was left in awe 
and 
pain. 
Watching 
Aidy 
Bryant of “Saturday Night 
Live,” who plays Annie, take 
center stage and deal with 
the 
ridiculously 
hilarious 
situations that happen to fat 
women was both entertaining 
and relatable. Her character 
explored 
typical 
things 
like finding out how to be 
confident in her writing and 
what she deserves in her love 
life. But she also had some 
challenging 
moments, 
and 
I found it quite upsetting 
to watch her deal with her 
mother, who was obsessed 
with dieting, or take ridicule 
from an asshole of a boss who 
made physical exercise, or 
“forced fun” as they call it in 
the show, a required activity 
for their office.
Throughout the week, many 
of my friends asked me what 
I had to say about the show 
because they knew I had 
written a piece about “coming 
out” as a fat person like Annie 
did. It was pretty incredible 

to find out that Annie’s article 
is based off of a blog post that 
Lindy West, the writer of the 
book 
and 
show, 
wrote in real life. 
These 
types 
of 
pieces are common 
in fat activism, and 
it was cool to see 
her 
experiences 
pan out on-screen.
However, 
as 
the season came 
to a close, I found 
myself 
initially 
dissatisfied 
with 
the ending. I was somewhat 
disappointed in Annie because 
I wanted more from a character 
who I thought represented 
fat women. I thought she was 
going to display someone who 
radically and unapologetically 
loved 
their 
body, 
even 
if 
they do not look like the 
mainstream image of beauty 
and health. I wanted her to 
win the fights with her mom 
and boss. I wanted her to be a 
woman I could look up to as a 
role model for body positivity. 
But with time, I soon came to 
understand that this show’s 
message is not about loving 
your body or body positivity, 
but rather is a lesson of 
size 
acceptance 
and 
body 
neutrality.
Two weeks ago, I went 
to a talk at the School of 
Public Health where Ragen 
Chastain, a fat activist, writer 
and athlete, discussed weight 
bias and the social justice 
issues 
aligned 
with 
this 
oppression. Listening to her 
unpack the empirical research 
on 
weight 
bias, 
fatphobia 
and how dieting is damaging 
for individuals’ mental and 
physical 
health 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
empowering 
presentations I have attended 
at our university.
As her talk came to a close, 
I asked Chastain what she 
thought about body positivity, 
the community online and the 
message to love your body the 
way it is. She said that she 
was conflicted on the way the 
community has transformed 
from radical fat experiences 
into a space for chubby white 
women. And she asked a 

question that continues to ring 
true to me: What about body 
neutrality? This is the idea 
that we don’t need to be in love 
with our bodies but we can 
accept our body’s size, the way 
our bodies look and the way 
they move unapologetically.
In general, the body positive 
community emphasizes the 
importance of loving your 
body and being as positive as 
possible. But if one fluctuates 
in the way they feel about their 
body, they may be set up to fail 
if they never reach the ultimate 
body love that is displayed 
by body positive social media 
accounts. So, if body positivity 
is not attainable, what about 
body 
neutrality? 
Whatever 
path you are on, whether it’s 
wanting to love or accept your 
body, it is probably going to 
be nonlinear, because it is 
difficult to unlearn things 
you were socialized to believe 
about bodies in relation to 
health and beauty.
As I am a white, fat woman 
who continues to discuss body 
size and the way our society 
treats larger bodied people, 
I used to think the body 
positivity movement was only 
empowering and benefiting 
individuals’ body image. But 
now it is clear to me that this 
movement is evolving and 
is not what everyone needs. 
Annie’s story in “Shrill” is not 
a path to body positivity, but 
a path toward size acceptance 
and body neutrality. She is not 
entirely empowered or in love 
with her body at the end of the 
season, and that alone is quite 
radical. As more narratives 
about fat people are entering 
mainstream media, “Shrill” 
should be celebrated as an 
important 
step 
in 
social 
change and representation. 
On the other hand, we must 
remember to think critically 
about the messages the show, 
and others like it, are sharing 
about fat bodies, and what 
social identities are being 
portrayed other than body 
size.

The 57th Ann Arbor Film 
Festival came to a close on Sunday 
night with a screening of some of 
this year’s award-winning short 
films. While The Daily’s coverage 
of the festival has largely focused 
on feature-length entrants, the 
eight shorts presented on Sunday 
ran the gamut of film-making 
techniques, 
packing 
a 
wide 
spectrum of innovation into 74 
minutes. A few of the films stood 
out as exceptionally engaging.
As an art history major, I 
particularly enjoyed “Running 
in Circles,” a short silent film by 
Ei Toshinari and Duy Nguyen. 
Shot at Robert Smithson’s “Spiral 
Jetty,” a work of land art near 
Rozel Point in Utah, the film 
shows a man running through the 
spiral from multiple perspectives. 
This union of art forms was a 
common theme among a few of 
the shorts. Most notably, Cheri 
Gaulke’s 
short 
documentary 
“Gloria’s 
Call” 
followed 
the 
studies and travels of Gloria 
Orenstein in the 1970s, sharing 
the stories of her friendships 
and encounters with leading 
female artists of the surrealist 
movement. 
“Gloria’s 
Call” 
explores femininity, spirituality 
and surrealism through a feminist 
lens; a refreshing presentation 
of 
surrealism’s 
oft 
forgotten 

heroines. “We Were Hardly More 
Than Children,” a film by Cecelia 
Condit, incorporates the Francis 
Bacon-esque paintings of Diane 
Messinger to explore memory 
and pain. The film’s dream-like 
presentation makes the narrative, 
a story of an illegal abortion in 
1969, even more gut-wrenching.
My clear favorite however 
was “La Via Divina (The Divine 
Way)” by Ilaria di Carlo. A 
parody of “Dante’s Inferno,” the 
approximately 
15-minute 
film 
depicts a woman descending 
an infinite staircase. Beautiful 
staircases are shown one after 
another, each time the same 
woman begins from the top of the 
frame and continues her descent. 
All sorts of architectural forms 
are represented in the staircases: 
industrial, Victorian, neoclassical. 
Most staircases circle infinitely 
downward in spirals, ellipses and 
squares, while some proceed in 
a straight line. This ridiculously 
playful film is cinema at its 
most essential: Beautiful forms 
depicted in motion, vivid color 
and rich texture, a score which 
complements the direction to 
highlight shifts in architectural 
style and mood.
With “La Via Divina,” Ilaria 
di 
Carlo 
won 
the 
Barbara 
Aronofsky Latham Award for an 
emerging 
experimental 
video 
artist. “We Were Hardly More 
Than Children” took the Eileen 

Maitland Award, and “Running 
in 
Circle” 
won 
the 
George 
Manupelli 
Founder’s 
Spirit 
Award, 
while 
“Gloria’s 
Call” 
was awarded Best Documentary 
Film. Other films shown at the 
screening 
ventures 
into 
the 
more avant-garde. For example, 
“Phantom Ride Phantom” by 
Siegfried A. Fruhaul, winner of 
a Jury Award, was a jarring and 
darkly post-modern symphony 
of aggressive audio over flashing 
photographs of railroad tracks. 
“As Above, So Below” by Cooper 
Holoweski used a split screen 
to develop the simultaneously 
endearing and unsettling notion 
that a whole universe may exist 
within every neutron — that our 
whole existence may lie within a 
microscopic particle in a larger, 
super-universe. This film won 
the 
PROCAM 
Best 
Regional 
Filmmaker Award.
The Ann Arbor Film Festival’s 
embrace 
of 
experimentation 
in film is laudable. The award-
winning shorts presented on 
Saturday instilled in me a new 
appreciation 
for 
innovative 
filmmaking by pushing me away 
from a canonical perspective on 
the art of film. While shorts may 
be an occasionally overlooked 
subsection 
of 
cinema, 
they 
contain 
some 
of 
the 
most 
artistic implementation of film’s 
unique qualities as a medium of 
expression.

The final day at the AAFF

ANN ARBOR FILM FESTIVAL COVERAGE

Daily Arts Writer

It is only rational to expect 
wonders from Claudia Rankine. 
It would be foolish not to, really, 
especially after her unflinching 
“Citizen: An American Lyric,” 
a masterpiece that received 
uncountable 
awards 
and 
that has already bled — with 
seeming permanence — into 
the University of Michigan’s 
English department. Rankine 
is often lionized for 
her unique capacity 
to address race and 
expose 
its 
biased-
invisibility in poetry. 
Imagine the literary 
world’s 
excitement, 
then, upon the news 
that 
Rankine 
had 
written a play.
“The White Card” 
is Rankine’s newest 
work 
to 
appear 
between stage wings, 
and 
it 
is 
violently 
visceral. The play is 
about a couple of art 
collectors and a Black 
artist, all three placed 
in 
the 
precarious 
aftermath of the entrance of 
the Trump administration. The 
couple, Charles and Virginia 
Spencer, in tandem with their 
art dealer Eric, invite Charlotte 
over in an attempt to woo her 
into selling art to Charles’ 
collection 
and 
foundation. 
It’s an objectively good match 
— 
fantastic 
artist, 
hungry 
art collectors. But it is also a 
precarious match: Charlotte’s 
art 
centers 
on 
the 
Black 
experience and its nuances, 
trying to offer a lens into the 
space where few are allowed. 
Charles and Virginia are white, 
both 
with 
a 
near-obsessive 
desire to do good politically, 
collecting art pieces on the 
experience of Black suffering. By 
the time the Spencers’ activist 
son, Alex, joins 
the 
dinner 
a 
quarter of the 
way 
into 
the 
play, the tension 
is choking.
Much of “The 
White Card,” to 
an extent, feels 
like that scene 
in “Get Out” — 
the one where 
Rose’s 
father, 
to the wince of 
the 
audience, 
goes out of his 
way to tell Chris 
that he “would 
have voted for 
Obama 
for 
a 

third time.” It is an unveiled 
attempt to pander to a Black 
man and to assuage one’s own 
white guilt, to convince oneself 
that they are the opposite of 
racist and to justify it to a person 
of color.
The entirety of “The White 
Card” 
is 
brimming 
with 
experiences like this, though 
Rankine takes things a step 
further. For one, the Spencers’ 
underlying tones are in check 
by their son. Though more 
importantly, the Spencers are 

not deliberate racists. They are 
both white and liberal advocates 
(or they try to be). They work 
outwardly to, in their view, 
combat racism by purchasing 
Black work.
Obviously, the classical white 
liberal in the era of Trump is a 
controversial and complex arc to 
examine. Delightfully, Rankine 
is not deterred.
Rankine’s judicious work on 
character make the two scenes 
of play even more provocative 
for readers. Each member of the 
six-person cast is placed deftly 
in the play, each stuffed full of 
lines almost uncomfortable with 
their specificity and attention to 
detail. It’s a design that makes 
attention crucial for readers, but 
one that pays off — readers pick 

up on tics and shortcomings 
of 
each 
character. 
Subtle, 
inappropriate 
remarks 
from 
the Spencers and Charlotte’s 
reaction to them feel so accurate 
that it’s nearly painful. Rankine 
uses the medium of conversation 
to flip the switch and reveal 
a 
conversation’s 
unbearable 
tensions 
in 
a 
single 
line. 
Characters always feel as though 
they are getting at something — 
each line of conversation seems 
to be a nod to an ideology or 
canned statement we employ 
when we discuss race. 
Rankine uses this cast 
of characters to offer 
a display of the white, 
unsure, mediocre liberal 
at its finest. Then for the 
final, stirring scene, she 
flips this on its head: 
She 
addresses 
such 
shortcomings head on.
Admittedly, 
there 
comes a point in “The 
White 
Card” 
where 
things 
began 
to 
feel 
counterfeit. 
Rankine’s 
commentary on race and 
politics are fantastic, but 
it feels as though that 
was all she had to talk 
about. Virginia Spencer 
speaks an almost unbelievable 
roll of accidentally insensitive 
comments, and Alex cannot go 
a line, it seems, without calling 
out his parents’ shortcomings. 
While 
this 
is 
not 
dry, 
it 
sometimes feels constructed and 
artificial. It appears as though 
Rankine felt the need to check 
off every possible encounter one 
could have with race in the span 
of a single work.
Maybe, though, this is what 
“The White Card” is meant to 
be. In all of its cringe-worthy 
moments, 
awkward 
silences 
and 
unmuted 
realizations, 
“The White Card” is — an all-
encompassing 
conversation 
centered on race for a new 
age of activism and change. 
A conversation in a complex, 
brash 
voice 
that examines 
culpability 
and 
what 
progress 
means. 
It 
is 
time, 
probably, 
that 
we 
listen to this 
conversation. 
And 
“The 
White 
Card” 
offers 
it 
to 
audiences 
from a stage 
where 
veils 
are 
removed 
for 
every 
viewer to see.

Rankine’s latest is gritty

their specificity and attention to detail

I’m trying to pinpoint the 
moment when I first realized 
FX’s “Better Things” was 
something special. It might 
have been within the first few 
minutes of the show, when 
single mother, Sam (Pamela 
Adlon, “Star vs. the Forces of 
Evil”) is talking to her youngest 
daughter, Duke (Olivia Edward, 
“The Outside Story”) 
in a mall bathroom. 
They’re 
discussing 
the dads in Duke’s 
class, some of whom 
Sam has hooked up 
with in the past.
“What 
about 
Charles’s dad? What 
about 
him?” 
asks 
Duke.
“Is he tall?” Sam 
jokes.
“To 
me,” 
Duke 
says.
Though 
they 
may seem mundane 
or 
simple 
to 
the 
untrained 
eye, 
so 
many little things — 
the location, Duke’s 
response, the matter-
of-factness with which Sam 
approaches her love life — work 
together to elevate “Better 
Things” above any shows it 
might be compared to, though 
it’s difficult to even imagine 
anything similar.
“Better 
Things” 
follows 
Sam Fox, an actress and single 
mother raising three daughters: 
sweet 
Duke, 
testy 
Frankie 
(Hannah 
Alligood, 
“The 
Divergent Series: Allegiant”) 
and 
entitled 
Max 
(Mikey 
Madison, 
“Monster”). 
The 
tone is less “Gilmore Girls” 
and more like that opening 
sequence of “Lady Bird,” when 
Saoirse Ronan throws herself 
out of the moving car. The show 
is an extended inquiry into 
the inventive and inaccurate 
ways that daughters project 
introspection onto the world, 
how mothers must constantly 
decide whether to administer or 
withhold the truth in response.
One 
strength 
of 
“Better 
Things” is that the show’s 
focus 
on 
parenthood 
and 

childhood puts four different 
mother-daughter 
dynamics 
at the forefront. Sam and her 
oldest daughter, Max, alternate 
between 
intense 
love 
and 
deep frustration; one feeling 
often amplifies the other. As a 
senior in high school, Max is 
old enough to think she knows 
her mother as a person outside 
their relationship, but she’s 
also young enough that this 
image of her mother is wildly 

inaccurate. Their tiffs are some 
of the show’s best work: Max 
says 
something 
ridiculous, 
Sam 
takes 
the 
bait. 
Max 
instinctively is open with her 
mother, but Sam prefers that 
she hides things. One of their 
first scenes alone in the pilot 
exemplifies this.
After Max asks Sam to buy 
her good weed, Sam tells her 
daughter not to share quite so 
much.
“Why, you’re my mom, I 
want you to know if I have sex 
or if I want to get high,” Max 
replies.
“Ah! No, hide things from 
me,” Sam says.
Later, Frankie bursts in while 
Sam is trying to watch porn. 
Spread-eagle on her mother’s 
bed, she wonders aloud if she 
should undergo female genital 
mutilation as a protest.
“Get out!” Sam yells in 
response.
The scene is typical of 
“Better Things”: a daughter 
intruding on her mother, a child 

saying something insane with 
complete, deadpan seriousness. 
“Better 
Things” 
treats 
the 
absurd urgency of adolescence 
as real but idiotic, a drive for 
self-expression that endures 
into adulthood. The show is 
unique among family dramas 
in that it never shies away from 
recognizing the never-ending 
push and pull between parents 
and children. Adlon, who both 
writes and stars in the show, 
is 
continuously 
finding 
new 
ways 
to acknowledge the 
complicated net of 
desire and disgust 
that makes a family.
It’s rare that a 
show 
immediately 
creates 
a 
fully-
formed world, but 
this is a feat that 
“Better 
Things” 
manages 
easily. 
The 
characters 
feel real in the best 
way, 
eschewing 
universality 
for 
specificity. 
What’s 
most 
striking 
and 
enjoyably 
familiar 
is the raw friction of 
seeing what happens 
when children and parents need 
radically different things from 
each other. Rather than leaning 
on tropes, “Better Things” 
takes on the hilarity and grief of 
the mundane: a woman giving 
her dogs their ear medicine, a 
daughter storming out of the 
DMV, a child crying over a 
nightmare. Nothing is special, 
so everything is.
Nearly every scene in “Better 
Things” is infused with an 
awareness of how quickly a 
moment can escalate, how 
sometimes every conversation 
between a mother and daughter 
feels like a test: of love, of 
mutual 
understanding, 
of 
how well-versed each is in 
the needs of the other. Now in 
its third season, the show is 
an underappreciated gem in 
both writing and performance 
— 
the 
rare 
comedy-drama 

that 
simultaneously 

embraces 
poignancy 
and 
humor, 
understanding 
the 
impossibility of separating the 
two.

Better Things

FX

Thursdays @ 10 p.m.

“Lowkey? Show Me the Body 
is for the freaks,” says frontman/
banjoist Julian Cashwan Pratt 
of the experimental hardcore 
band Show Me the Body in an 
interview with Kerrang! last 
week. Upon listening to the 
singles for their new album Dog 
Whistle, this sounds like a bold 
claim. Singles “Camp Orchestra” 
and 
“Madonna 
Rocket,” 
though 
excellent, appear to 
be pretty typical fare 
coming from the New 
York City hardcore 
scene. 
However, 
within the context 
of the album, the 
singles serve a much 
larger purpose: They 
help to tell a story 
that, contrary to the 
singles’s 
political 
tones, is collaborative 
and 
personal, 
conveyed in a way 
that every listener can 
relate to it in someway.
Lead single “Camp 
Orchestra” begins the album 
with a bang, despite its own 
slow start. The first sounds 
of the track are a rumbling 
bass guitar and a twinkling, 
meandering banjo. They are the 
only instruments for the song’s 
first two minutes and 10 seconds 
(the drums don’t even start until 
two minutes and 28 seconds 
into the song!), and that’s when 
the song begins to catch fire. 
Inspired by the Auschwitz-
Birkenau Memorial and their 
own Jewish heritage, Show Me 
the Body crafted a song that 
acutely describes the hardship 
and plight of their predecessors. 
The song is personal to the band 

while still remaining valuable 
and important to all listeners 
even if they have no personal 
connection to the subject matter.
While “Camp Orchestra” is 
more sonically typical of NYC 
hardcore, tracks like “Not for 
Love,” 
“Forks 
and 
Knives” 
and “USA Lullaby” stray far 
from the norm. For someone 
more accustomed to hardcore 
and punk music, these tracks 
will take some getting used to. 
Each song, especially “Not for 

Love,” pulls many of its defining 
elements from noise rock. “Not 
for Love” features a blown-out 
bass guitar reminiscent of an 808 
and punishing vocals ranging 
from guttural grunts to piercing 
shrieks 
and 
everywhere 
in 
between.
No part of Dog Whistle is 
typical. The sounds that Show 
Me the Body explores have 
probably 
never 
used 
before 
on a hardcore record. “Badge 
Grabber” utilizes both muted 
quantized drum loops and live 
drumming for an effect that is 
both a breath of fresh air and 
suffocating. 
“USA 
Lullaby” 
distorts its instrumentals so 

far beyond their limits that you 
can almost hear each artifact 
of sound. This is all makes for a 
very exciting and challenging 
work, but the album’s crowning 
achievement, 
“Madonna 
Rocket,” is also its least daring.
“Madonna Rocket” is one of 
the most beautiful and touching 
hardcore songs ever created. 
That’s a bold claim, but the track 
is wholly worthy of such praise. 
On “Madonna Rocket,” Show Me 
the Body takes the inclusive and 
community-oriented 
lyrics and fast-paced, 
jagged instrumentals 
from 
youth 
crew 
legends like Gorilla 
Biscuits and Youth of 
Today and filters them 
through their twisted 
creative 
collective/ 
think tank known as 
Corpus. The result 
is a triumphant yet 
brutal track. Cashwan 
Pratt’s 
vocals 
take 
center 
stage 
over 
the rest of the band 
as he growls, “(W)
hen I meet someone 
that’s good, I want to 
die with them / Dead 
friends, I still wanna say goodbye 
to them / Aside from me, Aside 
from them / All I have is family, 
I will die with them.”
With 
Dog 
Whistle, 
Show 
Me the Body aimed to create 
a community that the freaks 
could call home, and that they 
did. They also did so much more, 
creating an affecting album that 
is bound to resonate with all 
listeners in some capacity. At 
the very least, Dog Whistle will 
allow new listeners to access a 
world bigger than their own and 
give them a new perspective on 
community. Show Me the Body 
may be for the freaks, but it is 
also for everyone.

Teenage girls have been the 
most 
misunderstood 
part 
of 
humanity since the beginning 
of 
time. 
Even 
their 
own 
understanding of alienation is 
made fun of, turned into memes 
of “mom, it’s just a phase” and 
a 
brand 
of 
self-deprecating 
humor that proliferates across 
teen and adult society, even 
infecting girls themselves. It’s 
no wonder this is true — our 
media consistently pushes those 
few teenage girls who are self-
confident and genuine down to 
join the rest of their age group 
through unrealistic standards for 
everything from their bodies to 
the colors they are supposed to 
wear. We all know this, and many 
of us (including myself) have 
channeled their frustration at that 
pressure into classic existential 
angst. We pierce our noses, we 
dye our hair, we pick up the guitar 
or the cigarette, sometimes all at 
once. In avoiding one stereotype, 
we slowly move into another. 
There’s no better example of 
this kind of response to society 
than the mere existence of 
singer Billie Eilish. Eilish is a 
veritable unicorn in the music 
industrial complex — she’s a 
teenage girl, yes, but she’s missed 
the 
expected 
transformation 
and hypersexualization by a 
thread. She’s in charge of her 
own songwriting, often done 
with her brother and producer 
Finneas. Eilish is partial to pairing 
incredibly oversized sweatshirts 
and pants and has developed a 
fashion sense that literally only she 
could pull off. She’s not dancing in 
the hallways of a Catholic school 
in miniskirts, she’s collaborating 
with 
hypebeast 
fashion 
icon 
Takashi Murakami on Hot Topic-
esque 
merchandise. 
Eilish’s 

trademark is a sense of angst that 
never makes it into eye-rolling 
territory, creating an enthralling 
case study in what the fusion 
of 2019’s feminist environment 
and the extant pressure of her 
industry can do. 
So it’s no wonder that the singer 
has accrued a devoted army of 
followers and fans, most of them 
teenagers like herself. Though 
it’s a surprise to remember 
after watching a few of Eilish’s 
interviews or music videos, she’s 
only 17 — and started making 
music four years ago. Despite her 
age, Eilish oozes a kind of beyond-
her-years understanding of the 
world that many modern girls do, 
too. In a world that plays to their 
insecurities constantly, Eilish’s 
main audience sees a light in her 
music, one that tells them their 
jaded perception of society is ok 
and even cool. In this, the singer 
is under tremendous pressure 
to maintain her image as a 
perpetually bored and depressed 
beauty, languid in the spotlight of 
her own creation.
This is why the cult of Billie 
Eilish is more complex than it may 
seem. The legions of supporters 
she has garnered through her 
first EP and now her recent studio 
album WHEN WE ALL FALL 
ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO? 

expect a certain vibe from the 
performer at all times to mirror 
their own. Unfortunately for 
Eilish, that vibe is depressed and 
flippant. She’s real as hell, but at 
some point, that realness takes 
its toll. After all, the girl is only 
17. Eilish may have escaped the 
more classic markers of industry 
control, but instead of those, she 
has now fallen into a different sort 
of trap. Just like those of us who 
left bubblegum-pink lip gloss for 
fishnets, Eilish has broken the 
restraints of Ariana Grande-style 
pop-stardom only to find herself 
in another box: that of the emo 
princess.
There are dozens of examples 
that show there is a way out 
of this image, namely, that of 
Hayley Williams, the lead singer 
of Paramore. Now in her late 
twenties, Williams has managed 
to shed her early punk teenager 
image for that of a more balanced 
woman, one that still makes 
incredible music in the same 
alternative vein. This could be the 
path that Billie Eilish goes down, 
but for now, it’s up for debate. 
Watching her talk about how even 
the last year of her life has changed 
in the wake of fame, in a side-by-
side interview in Vanity Fair, it is 
worrying to see how Eilish’s dark 
stage persona has leeched into her 
real outlook on life. She represents 
a change in the industry towards 
a deeper understanding of the 
minds of teenage girls — but will 
that pressure to change drag her 
down? It’s hard to say right now, as 
she rides the wave of her album’s 
success this month. But in the next 
few years, I will keep a close eye 
on Eilish. She might transcend the 
constraints of her image, or delve 
deeper into their murky waters. 
Hopefully, she’ll swim.

The cult of Billie Eilish

The Daily Artz Punk Rockers ran the Probility Marathon relay 
last Sunday. We shockingly placed 14th, verified by the race’s rather 
impressive standardized results system. Writers can run, too. Ask John. 
He finished first in his leg.
The Probility Marathon, facilitated by Epic Races, held their first 
event in Ann Arbor in 2012. This event raised thousands of dollars 
for Ann Arbor Public Schools and various nonprofits. Recipients of 
this year’s race proceeds include Packard Health, Cancer Support 
Community, Ele’s Place and North Star Reach. Epic Races has raised a 
total of $205,000 for nonprofits since 2015. This number continues to 
grow through their events — which not only benefit charities, but the 
local runners who participate in them as well.
This year’s starting line began near Michigan Stadium, directly 
outside of Fingerle Lumber (RIP Fingerle). The course then proceeded 
into the Hill neighborhood, around Forest Hill Cemetery, through Gallop 
Park and, finally, through the Arboretum, which was arguably the worst 
leg of the run, thanks to its massive hill. The course then finished back 
at the start — outside of Fingerle, in view of Michigan Stadium in all its 
glory.
Cameron Trinh mastered the course and won the Marathon, with a 
time of 2:49:03. That’s a 6:27 pace! For 26.2 miles! Congrats from Daily 
Arts, Cameron. Most of us can’t run a mile that fast on a good day.
***
6:00 a.m. - Verity
I wake up on my couch to the tinny rattle of the iPhone alarm preset, 
computer still asleep on my stomach. My roommate and I have passed 
out perpendicular on the sectional again, feet kissing in the middle, 
up until three a.m. pounding out bad poetry analyses (sorry Marjorie). 
My lymph nodes are swollen for whatever reason; my mind is weak. I 
somehow peel myself out of the scene and fumble around in my bedroom 
for a minute or ten, tossing on a couple sweatshirts and throwing back 
various generic cold & flu pills in an effort to Feel Better. I’m moving 
slow. I can’t find my earbuds, and shake my roommate awake demanding 
she lend me hers.
When I look at my watch it’s somehow 6:45, and Fingerle Lumber is a 
30 minute walk away. I shamefully text the Punk Runners that I’m going 
to Uber to the start line, but then Emma offers to scoop me. Hell yeah. 
I lay back down on the couch for another five, willing my headache to 
abate, and then she texts me “Here.” I rise, anti-heroic, and my roommate 
stirs awake to murmur “you’re a champion, dude.” I almost fall down the 
stairs and then crawl into Emma’s Chevy. “I feel like shit,” I tell her. She 
hands me a CLIF bar. We roll out.
7:30 a.m. - Jenna, who ran the first leg and missed the rest of the marathon
Thankfully, I’m more awake now than I was 45 minutes before. I woke 
up late, inhaled oatmeal and spent the whole pre-race period praying that 
I wouldn’t vomit whilst running. The night before, I’d Googled “What to 
eat before running 7.05 miles,” but promptly ignored and subsequently 
forgot the Internet’s advice.
I also didn’t train whatsoever and hadn’t run all winter (because, 
honestly, who would want to). I wondered in between prayers if I could 
even run 7.05 miles. To chase the thought out of my head, I remember 
that, when Verity asked me if I could run 6 to 7 miles a week before the 
race, I responded with an enthusiastic “YES!” It was decided: whether 
or not I can run 7.05 miles, I’m going to run 7.05 miles.
Before I reluctantly leave my team to head toward the start line, John 
gives me a bandana, which I tie around my ponytail, and Emma and 
Verity hype me up for the race.
“I’m gonna win!” I say in response, knowing damn well that I am, in 

fact, not going to win.
“That’s the spirit!” they respond. Before I know it, the horn sounds 
and off I go, into an abyss of runners who are undoubtedly more ready 
for this than I am.
After fighting off the thought that I just might throw up, the miles 
seem to fly by. I’m perplexed by this the entire time I’m running, because 
usually I start dying around mile three. Conveniently, however, my 
boyfriend shows up with my dog and an adorable sign that says “Go 
Jenna” at the mile three marker. The thought of stopping then becomes 
impossible because stopping would fail both him and my dog, who not 
only woke up at the crack of dawn for me, but also made me a sign that 
I’ll keep until I actually die.
Another factor contributing to the rapid passage of miles might’ve 
been the fact that I’m listen to Queen’s “Fat Bottomed Girls” on repeat 
the entire time I’m running. Great choice in the context of running, bad 
choice in the context of contributing to a collaborative Punk Rockers 
playlist.
Who really knows how I finished my leg. The important thing is that I 
did. I round the corner in Gallop Park to see my loyal relay team hooting 
and hollering for me next to the giant bus that they missed earlier that 
morning just to see me start the race. I pass John the relay belt, wish him 
luck and watch him fade into the distance, his long strides looking a lot 
more graceful (and productive) than my short ones.
Though dead, I feel accomplished. I see my dad, my step-mom, my 
brother, his girlfriend and my dad’s so-ugly-she’s-cute bulldog waiting 
for me across the park. I kiss the dog before my dad tells me she just 
puked all over my brother’s girlfriend’s leg, and my brother’s girlfriend 
shows me the stain on her pants. I smile. I just ran 7.05 miles and not 
even dog puke can bring me down now.
I say goodbye to Emma and Verity, eat an omelet with my family and 
go straight to a three-and-a-half hour orientation for study abroad. I sit in 
an Angell Hall auditorium in my sweaty running clothes and “love” react 
to my relay team’s pre- and post-race selfies. My FOMO is overwhelming. 
I cheer aloud when I get the “we did it!” message a few hours later, and 
realize that, wow, we did do it. We ran a marathon.
7:31 a.m. - John
Preceding such a gentle passing-of-the-belt, Verity, Emma, Noah 
and I were meanwhile on the hunt for transportation to the hand-off 
point where I would take over from Jenna. Thankfully, Epic Races was 
providing a bus that would drive to the hand-off point. Unfortunately, 
we missed that bus. Granted, this was purposeful — the bus departed 
before the race began, and we wanted to see Jenna start. So, after she 
sped off, we were stuck at the finish line, race apparel doing little against 
the freezing weather, scrolling violently for a Lyft or an Uber that would 
pick us up.
Things didn’t look up much once we found a ride, though. Almost 
every road surrounding the race site was closed off. So, while we had 
succeeded in acquiring a Lyft, it was far away and struggling to come any 
closer. We huddled together for half an hour, watching the Lyft do circles 
on the map — all the while with Jenna approaching the hand-off point 
where no one waited for her.
At last our ride arrived. We crammed (certainly not illegally) and 
endured a fifteen-minute ride of near silence broken only by early 
morning jazz radio. Verity pulled out a copy of “Pride and Prejudice” 
from the dash, but it turned out to be an empty iPad case. It was silent 
and maybe a little awkward.
We arrived just on time to see Jenna making her way (galloping?) 
through Gallop Park.
8:30/40 a.m. - John encounters a woman holding a dixie cup
After Jenna handed me the belt (and Verity tightened it for me — yes, 
I am truly that incompetent) I was off. Unlike Jenna, I didn’t have a 
boyfriend or a dog awaiting me at mile three. Defeating, I know. All that 
expected me at such a checkpoint was an older woman hunched over, 
holding a cup of water and saying “good job.” Which is also fine.
The miles felt surprisingly short (which is emphatically not to 
say easy), and I guess I could say there seemed to be some sort of 
friendly ambience between all of the runners as we went along. Some 
understanding of mutual pain coupled with the fact that we all smelled 

revolting that made the movement easier. All the while I reveled in some 
good old Kero Kero Bonito and Polo and Pan which made me go faster 
(or so I’d like to believe).
The course twisted through U-M Medical Campus, through the Arb, 
and back down Central Campus to Hill Street where my very own abode 
lies. Things were feeling somewhat fantastic save a slight urge to vomit, 
and after my miles I finally crossed the second hand-off point, sweating 
violently, and I transferred the belt victoriously to Emma. Or, I would 
have transferred the belt victoriously to Emma, if she would have been 
there. She was not.
8:31 a.m. - Emma
After Verity and I watched John run off in all his glory, we made our 
way back to the start — this time with the wonderful (and free) help of a 
Michigan Flyer sponsored bus. It was as good as a chartered bus could be, 
which means it was pretty great. With its cushy seats and temperature 
control system, the bus provided a welcome respite from the morning 
cold. Verity and I spent the superlit ride back discussing everything from 
the race to high school crushes; it was an enlightening experience.
The bonding didn’t stop there, though. Once we arrived at the start, we 
talked to Eva Solomon, the event coordinator, about the race and started 
to explore the amenities offered to athletes. We eventually found Gabe 
Solomon, a human pancake making machine, and some scrumptious 
breakfast burritos. All the while John was trudging along through the 
second leg of the race, it truly was the best of both worlds. That said, 
Verity and I got sidetracked exploring the start line and ran into some 
problems finding the exchange point for the relay. We eventually got 
there (and John only had to wait for five minutes.)
9:15 a.m. - Emma listens to a podcast
Verity made a collaborative playlist so we could share what we all 
listened to while running and I contributed, like the team player I am. 
But I won’t lie: I wasn’t listening to the songs I put on there. My media of 
choice is a podcast and I’ve been called a psycho by one person several 
times because of it. I still stand by my choice – the podcast in question is 
Crooked Media’s “Keep it” and helps me keep up on all the pop-culture-
turned-political-drama I could ever ask for. The hosts are a funny trio 
(Ira Madison III, Louis Virtel and (my favorite) Kara Brown) and keep 
my mind off the fact that I am without a doubt dying while I run.
The actual run wasn’t too eventful. Did I know where I was supposed to 
go the whole time? Not particularly, but that’s why the other participants 
are there. I will admit that it took me at least four miles to remember that 
the plan wasn’t for me to circle back to the start, but rather end at Gallup. 
Pro tip for running a race: look at the race map before you head out.
There is something oddly satisfying about running through the streets 
of Ann Arbor; the roads are closed just for racers and you have the whole 
street to yourself. I timed it well enough, or maybe I was just that slow, 
where there were never too many people around me, and I didn’t have 
to share the street with anyone but the encouraging race volunteers. My 
heart was light, even if my legs weren’t.
On the point of the race volunteers, I had absolutely no clue how to 
interact with them. Was I supposed to smile? Did I have to make eye 
contact? What do I do when they’re shoving water in my face? Obviously, 
I appreciated the water and the encouragement, but when you’re the 
only one in the general vicinity and have no ability to chalk up your 
rudeness to the fact that they weren’t talking to you, it gets real. Most of 
the time, I gave a half-hearted smile or quickly averted my eyes and just 
pretended not to hear them. I had headphones in, so that’s fine, right? My 
manners may appall Emily Post, but my nerves applauded the decision.
By the last three miles of the race, I was in the middle of Ira, Louis and 
Kara’s interview with Busy Phillips and I just have one quote to leave 
you with: “I know that you think that I’m like the mom down the street, 
and that’s chill, but I’ve also worked my fucking ass off in Hollywood 
for 20 years and I have some nice shit.” Busy Phillips provided all the 
aspirational moods I needed to get through my last mile, and I may not 
have worked 20 years in Hollywood by the end, but I did run seven miles 
and it felt great. 

Daily Arts really ran a marathon. We nearly won.

Carson’s grand slam emblematic 
of freshmen success for Michigan

By the bottom of the second 
inning, the No. 23 Michigan 
softball team had fallen into a 
pattern: get walked to first on 
a full count, round the bases to 
home, repeat. 
Then, 
freshman 
catcher 
Hannah Carson stepped up to the 
plate. 
Before 
Wednesday’s 
game 
against Toledo, Carson had 35 
at-bats, registering eight hits, 
though only two were translated 
into runs. Close games early in the 
season didn’t allow freshmen like 
Carson to see much playing time, 
but recent offensive surges have 
allowed her more time on the field. 
In these games, the non-starters 
have shown their worth. 
Carson, 
who’s 
had 
more 
defensive opportunities than most 
freshmen on the team, has proven 
to be an asset to the Wolverines 
behind the plate, not committing a 
single error in her 22 appearances 
this season. 
“Hannah’s been behind the 
plate,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “She’s a fine catcher. She 
does a great job receiving, she’s got 
a gun for an arm and just learning 
to keep up with the intensity of 
this game — she’s done that when 
she’s had her opportunity. We can 
put her in at any time; we have 
confidence in her that way.” 
But on Wednesday, it was her 
time to prove herself offensively 
against the Rockets. 
The Wolverines were up 15-0 
by the time Carson picked up the 
bat. With the bases loaded and 
two outs, Michigan was looking 
to extend an already long inning. 
After a strike, a foul, and two 
balls, it looked like Carson’s at-bat 
would result in another walk, but 
that wasn’t in the cards. 
On the next pitch, Carson 
swung hard, sending a line drive 
over the right-field wall —the 
first home run of her collegiate 

career. The grand slam increased 
Michigan’s lead to 19. 
Because the ball was so low, 
Carson didn’t even know whether 
it went out of the field. 
The impressive feat by the 
freshman demonstrated just how 
impactful this class can be when 
given the chance. 
Every 
player 
except 
for 
sophomore 
Meghan 
Beaubien 
made 
an 
appearance 
before 
the game ended in the fifth 
inning. The non-starters didn’t 
disappoint, accounting for seven 
of the Wolverines’ 24 runs. 
Carson’s grand slam was followed 
by a home run from freshman 
infielder Gianna Carosone.
While Hutchins said she loved 
the home runs, these weren’t the 
highlights of the game in her eyes. 
 
“I was most excited that (the 
underclassmen) were able to 
get in and get some meaningful 
time — more than one at-bat and 
get on the defensive side of the 
ball,” Hutchins said. “They’re our 
future.”

Carson almost repeated this 
performance in the next inning 
when she fired a ball towards 
center field. Just shy of high 
enough, 
the 
ball 
ricocheted 
against the back wall where a 
Rockets outfielder failed to make 
the catch, resulting in a double. 
Carson’s hit brought two runners 
home, bringing her RBI total to six 
for the game. 
“I thought it was (going out) for 
a minute there,” Carson said. “But 
it was really exciting anyway.” 
In 
between 
these 
at-bats, 
Carson was substituted in for 
catcher Katie Alexander behind 
the plate, a role she will likely 
continue to occupy after the senior 
graduates. 
“She’s got all the skill sets that 
we need,” Hutchins said. “I think 
she’s got the ability to be a really 
great player here. She’s learning 
how to hit at this level, which is 
really learning how to manage the 
strike zone.
“The 
sky’s 
the 
limit 
for 
Hannah.”

Storako rebounds against Toledo

 Alex Storako took a deep 
breath, gripped the ball in her 
glove and began her windup. 
With a pair of runners aboard 
and two outs in the inning, the 
freshman right-hander’s pitch 
froze Toledo’s Brianna Robeson 
— Storako’s fourth strikeout of 
the inning.
The four-strikeout inning is 
a rarity. On Wednesday, Storako 
achieved the feat during the No. 
23 Michigan softball team’s 24-3 
victory over the Rockets (10-
19), an onslaught that marked 
the Wolverines’ (24-10) 12th 
consecutive win.
Storako’s own blunder made 
the 
four-strikeout 
oddity 
possible. In the first at-bat of the 
second inning, Toledo’s Kaitlyn 
Bergman uncorked a vicious 
swing on a ball well outside 
of the strike zone with two 
strikes in the count. Bergman 
whiffed on the wild pitch, but 
the ball bounced away from 
senior catcher Katie Alexander, 
allowing Bergman to reach base 

on the dropped third strike 
rule. Storako received credit for 
the strikeout, but no out was 
recorded.
After plunking the next batter 
with a fastball, Storako appeared 
to be on the verge of unraveling.
The 
last 
time 
Storako 
found herself in a situation 
involving two baserunners, she 
surrendered a three-run home 
run to Rutgers on Saturday. 
That wasn’t her only rough 
patch during the Wolverines’ 
series in Piscataway, as she 
failed to escape the first inning 
of the previous game. Following 
a double, walk and single by 
the Scarlet Knights to begin 
the 
game, 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol Hutchins called upon 
sophomore left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien to clean up Storako’s 
mess.
Storako recorded just one 
out in that start — the shortest 
outing of her young college 
career.
“I’d like to see Storako go to 
the next level,” Hutchins said 
after Saturday. “That’s keeping 
her composure and keeping her 
spin on pitches while she starts 
muscling it up and trying harder 
when the game gets intense. It’s 
time to grow. We learn and get 
better in moments and stress, so 
I’d like to see her get a little bit 
better.”
During Wednesday’s start, 
Storako showed flashes of next-
level dominance. She hurled 
three 
no-hit 
innings 
while 
posting seven strikeouts and 
zero walks on just 47 pitches. 
Storako’s pristine spin carried 
her throughout the afternoon 
until Hutchins substituted her 
out of the game along with the 
rest of the starting lineup.
“(Storako) finished strong,” 
Hutchins said. “We need her to 
keep getting better and learn 
how to be intense every pitch 
without trying too hard. She’s a 
spin, moving pitcher and those 
pitchers do, if anybody, have 
trouble with the command. 
That’s not unusual.”

By the time Storako’s day was 
done, the Wolverines’ 24-run 
lead meant the rest of the game 
was merely a formality.
For Storako, the three strong 
innings were a much-needed 
boost before Michigan’s Big Ten 
home stretch. The team’s final 17 
games are all against conference 
opponents, and having multiple 
reliable starting pitchers will 
be a key. Beaubien has already 
thrown over half of the team’s 
innings so far this season, so 
Storako’s steady progression is a 
major plus.
“It’s really awesome to see 
her in the mindset of attacking 
things,” 
said 
senior 
second 
baseman Faith Canfield. “Having 
to be behind Meghan (Beaubien) 
is a hard role, and I think she can 
get complacent there and I don’t 
think she has. Having this sense 
of being able to come out and 
attack it is really going to help 
her in the long run.”
Added 
freshman 
catcher 
Hannah Carson: “I know this 
whole week she’s been working 
on her pitches and she’s been 
pretty disciplined. So it was 
really nice to see her come 
out and power through those 
hitters.”
At 
this 
point, 
Storako’s 
numbers reflect a solid overall 
freshman 
campaign. 
After 
Wednesday’s dominant outing, 
her ERA is down to 2.11. She’s 
amassed 110 strikeouts across 
89.2 innings, and opponents 
have posted a batting average of 
just .176 against her.
Storako’s only shortcomings 
have come in the form of walks 
and long balls. So far, she’s 
served up 12 home runs and 
issued 34 walks. The rest of the 
staff has allowed a combined five 
homers and 26 walks.
If Storako can pound the strike 
zone and surrender fewer home 
runs, recording four strikeouts 
in an inning will be the least of 
her accomplishments.
“Four strikeouts?” Hutchins 
joked. “I’d just as soon have 
three and get off the field.”

Advanced metrics aid Wolverines

Erik Bakich has said in the past 
he believes his staff is leading the 
way on analytics. The defensive 
shift has taken over baseball, and 
Michigan is no stranger to using 
any advantage it can to make the 
difference.
“That’s a big picture over 
the long haul type of situation,” 
Bakich said. “So a few may have 
squeezed through and found a 
hole today, but over the course of 
the season by playing the non-pull 
side infielder more up the middle, 
we will actually take more hits 
away up the middle doing that.”
On 
Wednesday 
afternoon 
against Toledo, it seemed to hurt 
the Wolverines as senior infielder 
Blake Nelson saw several balls 
pass him after he shifted. In this 
case, the defensive shift didn’t 
pay off. But at the end of the day, 
it didn’t matter, as the Wolverines 
won, 8-2, and hope their shifts 
continue to pay dividends as the 
season progresses. And while it 
may seem strange to a casual fan 
that the defenders are leaving 
entire swaths of the field open, 
Bakich is firm in his belief that the 
method works.
“So, over the course of the 
season when the metrics are 
calculated and we look back at it, 
it’s going to be way more in the 

positives in our favor,” Bakich 
said. “Even those three or four 
balls that got through today — 
we’ve had so many outs up the 
middle just by having that non-
pull side infielder up there behind 
second base.
“You see more fly balls that 
are hit, just across the board, you 
see more fly balls that go to the 
opposite field than more ground 
balls that go to the pull side. So we 
defend that a lot.”
The shifts are based on if the 
batter 
is 
right 
or 
left-handed. 
If the batter is 
right-handed the 
defense will often 
shift to the third 
base 
side. 
The 
shortstop moves 
closer 
to 
third 
and the second 
baseman 
moves 
to 
replace 
the 
shortstop. 
The 
scheme is simply flipped for left-
handed hitters.
The defensive strategy seems 
to have paid off as Michigan’s 
team fielding percentage of .973 is 
second in the Big Ten only behind 
Illinois at .979. To come up with 
the defensive shifts, Bakich and 
his staff have to do more than just 
look at stats. The coaches have a 
substantial process to decide how 
to set up the defense.

The Wolverines utilize several 
companies for this. To look at 
their opponents hitting Michigan 
uses 6-4-3 Charts which gives the 
spray charts of their opponents. 
The Wolverines try to identify 
opponents’ tendencies on video 
using a company called Synergy.
“We watch all of our opponents 
each week,” Bakich said. “And 
then we know how our pitchers 
pitch and what our plan is against 
their hitters. And then we just 
try to put our guys where the 
opponents 
are 
gonna 
hit 
the 
ball.”
Michigan’s 
unique personnel 
allows 
it 
to 
be 
even 
more 
aggressive than 
most teams on 
defensive shifts. 
For 
opposing 
teams, the bold 
shifts add to the 
challenge of playing against such a 
tough defensive team in Michigan.
“There’s not as many ground 
balls hits that are hit the other 
way,” Bakich said. “Certainly not 
down the opposite field line on 
the ground. Which is why we have 
our corner guys so far off the lines 
most of the time. When you have 
an athlete like Jordan Brewer 
or Jimmy Kerr or whoever it is; 
you’re just shrinking the field.”

Position review: Linebackers

Back in 2015, the Michigan 
football team landed a coup.
Devin Bush was supposed 
to go to Florida State. His dad 
played for the Seminoles and 
was a legend for them. Bush was 
a legacy, a highly-touted South 
Florida kid who’d have his pick 
of colleges.
But Florida State didn’t have 
Jim Harbaugh or Don Brown. 
And those two convinced him 
to leave Hollywood, Fla. for Ann 
Arbor. Along with him came two 
high school teammates — now-
senior safety Josh Metellus and 
now-senior linebacker Devin 
Gil. The elder Bush got a job 
as a defensive analyst for the 
Wolverines.
And anchored by Bush, the 
Wolverines’ defense began a 
new era.
In 
his 
final 
season 
at 
Michigan, the junior linebacker 
was 
electric. 
Though 
just 
5-foot-11 and 233 pounds, Bush 
finished with 79 tackles, nine 
tackles for loss, five sacks and 
six pass breakups. Bush was 
a 
consensus 
All-American 
and a finalist for the Butkus 
Award, for the best collegiate 
linebacker, and the Nagurski 
Trophy, for the best collegiate 
defensive player.
Though 
overshadowed 
by 
Bush, VIPER Khaleke Hudson 
was named an All-Big Ten 
honorable 
mention 
after 
a 
strong junior season. Playing a 
hybrid role, Hudson’s versatility 
was a boon to the Wolverines’ 
defense.
The 
graduation 
of 
Mike 
McCray in 2018 allowed others 
— including Gil and then-
sophomore Josh Ross — the 
chance to show their stuff 
at linebacker. Ross was also 
named an All-Big Ten honorable 
mention.
However, when Bush got 
injured and sat out the Peach 
Bowl, his absence proved that 
he was the true anchor of 

Michigan’s linebacking corps, 
leaving the Wolverines with 
a hole they struggled to fill. 
How others step up to fill that 
hole could determine how high 
Michigan’s ceiling is in 2019.
HIGH POINT: Bush stood 
in the center of the painted-
white logo at Spartan Stadium. 
Headphones in one hand, he 
went to work, kicking and 
digging his feet into the turf, 
defacing 
the 
once-pristine 
spartan.
This was, after all, a rivalry 
game — one with no dearth of 
disrespect from either side. But 
it wouldn’t have been a good 
look for Bush to have that kind 
of pregame outburst without 
backing it up on the field.
So Bush went in and showed 
Michigan State who was boss.
Perhaps no play was more 
emblematic of the game than 
one Bush made in the fourth 
quarter, with the Wolverines 
up 21-7 and the Spartans facing 
second-and-1 
at 
Michigan’s 
24-yard line just after the 
two-minute warning. Score a 
quick touchdown and recover 
an onside kick, and a Spartan 
comeback 
would 
still 
be 
possible.
Instead, Bush came after 
Michigan 
State 
quarterback 
Rocky Lombardi and sacked 
him for an 11-yard loss. On 
third-and-long, Lombardi was 
sacked again. The attempted 
fourth-down 
conversion 
fell 
short, and the 
Wolverines bled 
out the clock on 
a 
much-needed 
win.
In 
a 
game 
where 
the 
defense 
made 
plays 
all 
day 
long, 
Bush’s 
pregame 
antics 
were symbolic.
LOW POINT: In the fourth 
quarter of the Peach Bowl, 
Florida attempted a punt from 
its own 20. Hudson came up and 

blocked it in the end zone for a 
safety.
Unfortunately for Michigan, 
all that did was decrease the 
Gators’ lead from 28 points to 
26. And the linebackers were a 
large reason for the deficit.
Bush had injured his hip 
in 
the 
third 
quarter of the 
loss 
to 
Ohio 
State and failed 
to get medical 
clearance 
to 
participate 
in 
bowl practices or 
play in the game. 
So he withdrew 
and focused on 
preparing for the 
NFL draft.
The Wolverines’ first taste of 
life without Bush wasn’t pretty, 
to put it nicely.
Ross 
started 
at 
middle 
linebacker in his place, flanked 

by Hudson and Gil. But where 
Bush once sped down the field, 
chasing the quarterback and 
wreaking havoc on opposing 
offenses, 
his 
replacements 
looked lost.
Florida quarterback Feleipe 
Franks noticed the hole and 
took advantage. Franks not 
only threw for 173 yards and 
a touchdown, he was also the 
Gators’ second-leading rusher 
with 74 yards and a touchdown 
— this for a quarterback not 
exactly known as a dual-threat. 
Without Bush there to clog the 
running game, four different 
Florida players had runs of 30 
yards or longer.
Michigan could only watch as 
the Gators sped away.
THE FUTURE: Losing a 
talent like Bush — especially 
one that has started for the past 
two years — is always going to 
hurt. But what the Peach Bowl 

showed is that the Wolverines 
may miss Bush even more than 
they thought, for the simple fact 
that he made the linebackers 
around him better.
Hudson and Ross are talented, 
to be clear, and another year 
of experience can only help. 
But 
they’re 
not the same 
without Bush in 
between them. 
Ross 
started 
at 
middle 
linebacker 
in 
the Peach Bowl, 
indicating that 
he may be the 
future choice at 
the position — 
albeit one with 
a big learning curve.
Gil, 
fifth-year 
senior 
Jordan Glasgow and redshirt 
sophomore 
Cam 
McGrone 
are others who could fill the 

vacant linebacker spot, but none 
incite particular excitement. 
Newcomer Anthony Solomon 
was a four-star recruit as an 
outside linebacker, but as with 
most freshmen, he is unlikely to 
contribute right away.
And even if one of them does 
step up, none have 
the kind of talent 
that Bush did, and 
they won’t be the 
kind of defensive 
centerpiece 
that 
Bush was. 
Only time will 
tell 
what 
the 
future holds for 
the 
linebackers, 
but of all of the 
Wolverines’ 
position groups, it may be the 
one with the most questions 
entering 2019. The way the 
season ended only makes those 
questions louder.

Position review: Secondary

The stats don’t jump off the 
page.
Michigan’s 
secondary 
had 
just 11 interceptions last season, 
tied for 60th in the country 
with 
middling 
teams 
such 
as 
Minnesota 
and 
Nebraska. 
Despite 
that, 
the Wolverines’ 
defensive backs 
played at an elite 
level most of the 
year.
But the story 
— as with many 
of the Michigan 
football 
team’s 
other units — had 
a familiar ending. Secondary 
play crumbled in a loss at Ohio 
State in November and then 
again in the Peach Bowl against 
Florida, calling into question 

whether the unit was really ever 
that elite in the first place.
That’s not to say there weren’t 
positives. Cornerbacks Lavert 
Hill and David Long had their 
praises sung all season long and 
for good reason. Regularly rated 
high by advanced stats, Hill’s 
and Long’s reputations preceded 
them. The pair 
received 
fewer 
targets as other 
teams 
feared 
their 
abilities, 
and when passes 
did come their 
way, they were 
almost 
always 
broken up. Hill 
and Long were 
both 
All-Big 
Ten First Team 
selections; Hill was also honored 
as a Third Team All-American 
by the Associated Press.
The safeties also got their 
share of accolades. Senior safety 

Josh Metellus was a Second 
Team All-Big Ten selection and 
then-senior safety Tyree Kinnel 
garnered an honorable mention.
HIGH POINT: There was 
Brandon Watson, and then there 
was open space.
Maybe Penn State quarterback 
Tommy Stevens overthrew the 
ball, 
or 
maybe 
he 
underthrew 
it. 
Either 
way, 
Watson was the 
only 
player 
in 
the vicinity. The 
then-fifth-year 
senior cornerback 
caught the ball, 
ran 
and 
didn’t 
stop until he was 
in the end zone.
The touchdown 
put the Wolverines up, 28-0, late 
in the third quarter and all but 
shut the door on any potential 
Nittany Lion comeback. The rest 
of the secondary also dazzled, 

holding Penn State passers to a 
collective 8-for-17 with two pass 
breakups.
Then, in the fourth quarter 
following a touchdown, Long 
intercepted Trace McSorley on 
the first play of the next drive, 
giving Michigan the ball back at 
the Nittany Lion 12. Four plays 
later, 
running 
back 
Chris 
Evans punched 
it in for a one-
yard touchdown 
to 
put 
the 
Wolverines up, 
42-0.
What 
had 
been a much-
anticipated 
matchup 
against 
the 
No. 14 team in the country had 
become a laugher.
LOW POINT: In Columbus 
three weeks later, Watson was 
once again the story. But this 

one didn’t have a happy ending 
for Michigan.
On seemingly every play, 
Buckeye 
receivers 
targeted 
Watson in coverage. And on 
seemingly every play, they left 
Watson in the dust.
The Wolverines’ press-man 
defensive scheme meant that the 
defensive line had to pressure 
the quarterback as much as 
possible, so as to 
avoid 
receivers 
getting 
free 
against man-to-
man 
coverage. 
But Ohio State 
was 
prepared. 
Its screen passes 
and 
crossing 
routes 
were 
intended 
to 
get 
the 
ball 
out 
quickly, 
matching its speedy receivers 
against Michigan’s secondary.
And 
the 
secondary 
— 
especially 
Watson 
— 
just 
couldn’t keep up in a 62-39 loss.
The loss was a shock in a lot 
of ways, but perhaps the biggest 
was the extent to which the 
secondary, which had played 
at a high level all year, got 
torched. It didn’t take long for 
fans to tweet in despair asking 
why Watson was still in the 
game, begging the defense to 
do anything. Of course, in all 
likelihood, it wouldn’t have 
made a difference.
Buckeye quarterback Dwayne 
Haskins threw for 318 yards and 
five touchdowns, a performance 
that cemented his status as 
one of the top 
quarterbacks 
in 
the 
2019 
NFL draft. The 
Wolverines 
never 
had 
a 
chance.
The secondary 
wasn’t 
put 
in 
a 
position 
to 
succeed 
against 
Ohio 
State, but that 
doesn’t change the fact that in 
the biggest game of the year, 
a highly-touted unit came up 
short again and again.
THE 
FUTURE: 
The 

secondary enters 2019 facing a 
lot of question marks, and not 
just because of how the season 
ended. Long decided to forego 
his final year of eligibility to 
declare for the draft, and Kinnel 
graduated, leaving two big pairs 
of shoes to fill.
The favorite to replace Long 
is likely junior Ambry Thomas, 
who showcased his speed as a 
kick 
returner 
during 
his 
first two years. 
But 
Thomas’ 
technique 
is 
raw, and the fact 
that 
defensive 
coordinator Don 
Brown did not 
trust him enough 
to try him over 
Watson 
when 
things started to 
go sideways in Columbus isn’t 
exactly a good sign.
At safety, junior J’Marick 
Woods is next on the depth chart 
behind Metellus, according to 
Jim Harbaugh, while junior 
Brad Hawkins is the favorite 
at nickel. Both played backup 
snaps 
throughout 
the 
2018 
season. But the X-factor here 
is five-star incoming freshman 
Daxton 
Hill. 
Hill 
had 
a 
whirlwind 
recruitment: 
He 
initially committed to Michigan, 
but 
decommitted 
from 
the 
Wolverines and committed to 
Alabama less than two months 
later, only to eventually sign 
with Michigan after all. The 
Tulsa, Okla. native was ranked 
the 14th-best prospect in the 
country and the 
top-rated safety. 
If 
Hill 
proves 
he’s 
ready, 
he 
could make an 
impact 
right 
away.
Meanwhile, 
Lavert 
Hill 
decided 
to 
return and man 
the 
cornerback 
position for one 
more year. If he puts up numbers 
like he did last season, he’s an 
early favorite to garner All-
Big Ten and perhaps even All-
American honors again.
