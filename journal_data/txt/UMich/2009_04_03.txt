MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Members'
low turnout
plagues MSA

This semester, 30%
of members didn't
show at meetings
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
Throughout the campaign
season for the Michigan Student
Assembly, members from both
parties made it a point that, if
elected, they would work to bet-
ter include the student body in
the governing process.
But recent attendance data
obtained from MSA shows that
Abhishek Mahanti and Mike
Rorro, the new President and Vice
President for MSA, might need
to look to participation from the
assembly's own members before
trying to tackle the campus as a
whole.
Nearly 30 percent of assembly
members, on average, have failed
to show up or stay throughout,
entire MSA meetings and other
related obligations this semes-
ter, according to the data. There
has been an average of about 12
absences and about 31 representa-

tives present at each meeting.
Additionally, 14 of the assem-
bly's representatives have accu-
mulated more than 10 absences
this semester.
Though dismal, those numbers
look much better when compared
to last semester, when an average
of 32.5 percent of members were
missing at each meeting.
There was an average of about
13 representatives missing at each
meeting and about 27 representa-
tives present. There were also 17
representatives who had more
than 10 absences and five who
had accumulated more than 20.
Former Student General Coun-
sel Michael Benson said that
while there is a 12-absence maxi-
mum, representatives maintain
assembly status and don't have
to appeal their absences until
they receive a full account of
their absences in writing. There
is often a delay in these e-mails,
and some representatives accu-
mulate upwards of 20 absences in
this way.
MSA President Abhishek
Mahanti said he recognizes that
attendance is an issue. He said

'IJ,, LEO seek arbitration

CALLED TO WASHINGTON
'U' prof. tapped
'to head census

By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
One of the University's very
own may soon leave campus to
join the new administration in
Washington, accordingto areport
from The Associated Press.
President Barack Obama nom-
inated Dr. Robert M. Groves, a
University professor of sociol-
ogy, to be the next director of
the Census Bureau yesterday
afternoon. In his 34 years of
work at the University, Groves
has focused on methods for
improving survey response and
accuracy. With the 2010 census
approaching this could lead to
changes in how the U.S. popula-
tion is counted - a controversial

topic on Capitol Hill.
A University staff member
since 1975 and Institute for Social
Research Survey Research Cen-
ter Director since 2001, Groves
has made his career in survey
research and sociology.
James Jackson, director of the
University's Institute for Social
Research, wrote in a statement
released yesterday that Groves's
nomination reflects well on the
University asa whole.
"The intended nomination is
an honor to the University and to
ISR," he wrote.
Jackson noted that Groves's
possible appointment to the Cen-
sus Bureau, however, would be
bittersweet.

Union alleges
University shuffled
money to reduce
lecturers' pay raises
By JILLIAN BERMAN
and JACOB SMILOVITZ
DailyNewsEditors
An alleged breach of the lectur-
ers' union contract by the Univer-
sity has pushed the two parties to
seek arbitration to settle a dispute
over pay raises.
The Lecturers' Employees Orga-
nization is accusing the University
of using "creative accounting" to
move money from one "fund" to
another in order to avoid larger pay
raises for lecturers. The organiza-
tion contends these moves meant
the difference between a 4.1 per-
cent and a 2 percent salary increase
for University lecturers this year.
The four funding accounts in
question from the College of Litera-
ture, Science, and the Arts are the
"A Fund," "B Fund," "C Fund" and
"Super C Fund." Thoughnot defined
explicitly, these funds serve differ-
ent purposes, but together cover all
parts of faculty salaries in LSA.
According to documents
obtained by LEO through a Free-
dom of Information Act request,

the "A Fund" is the average faculty
salary program in LSA and is avail-
able to academic units to distribute
to faculty. The documents, which
are signed by Jeff Frumkin, associ-
ate provost and senior director for
academic human resources, state
"Virtually all faculty members are
eligible to receive an increase from
the 'A Fund."' In recent years, the
"A Fund" has fallen from 62.6 per-
cent of LSA's entire compensation
for the year in 2005 to 38.1 percent
in 2009.
The "B Fund" is used specifically
for promotion and retention, for
example, when a faculty member
becomes an associate professor or
professor. Over the last five years,
the "B Fund" has held steady at
around 20 percent of LSA's entire
compensation for the year.
The controversy lies with the
"C Fund" and "D Fund" - or as it's
called the "Super C Fund."
According to the LEO docu-
ments obtained through FOIA,
the "C Fund is used to recognize
faculty members' special achieve-
ments (e.g. in service, scholarship,
instruction) and may also be used
to address structural inequities in
the salary program." All monies
awarded from the "C Fund" are
recommended by a department and
approved by the dean. Since 2005,
the percentage of this fund rela-
tive to the entire compensation for

Above are the percentages of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts's total salary compen-
sation allocated to each of thefour funds in question. LEO officials allege that the Universityhas
used the "C Fund" and "D Fund" - or'"Super C Fund"- to hide salary increases for tenure-track
faculty that should have also subsequently increased the salaries oftthe University's lecturers.

the year has varied widely, stand-
ing at about 34 percent of the total
compensation in 2007 and then
dropping to 11 percent of the total
compensation the following year.
In 2008, the "C Fund" comprised
about 20 percent of the total com-
pensation for the year.
The "Super C Fund" isn't used
by the college or dean's office to
fund the faculty salary program,
according to the FOIA documents.
Instead, it is used by the dean's
office to "account for relatively

small corrections to faculty salary
anomalies," the documents state.
The example given in the docu-
ments is when LSA must average
two different salary rates for a sin-
gle faculty member.
The documents state that in cer-
tain years, like 2008 and 2009, LSA
specifically used a portion of the "C
Fund" for "strategically targeted
purposes." One example is when
LSA improved gender pay gaps in
the college. After only comprising

THE ECONOMICS OF SPORTS
Prof.: Final Four might not help Detroit

Winfree says games
create more hype
than economic boost
By ERIK TORENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
As this year's much-anticipated
NCAA Tournament Final Four
arrives in Detroit this weekend,
many have touted the economic
boost the games will bring to the
downtrodden city. But one Univer-
sity professor says that the games'
impact might not be as clear as
some have predicted.
Kinesiology Prof. Jason Winfree
said that the economic impacts of
these types of sporting events are

usually over-estimated.
"The Super Bowl was expected
to bring in $300 million, but in
reality it brought about one-tenth
of that," he said. "The Final Four
is estimated to bring in $30 to $50
million in revenue, but that number
isn't a big deal to the city of Detroit,"
because as he explained it's not that
much money relative to Detroit's
dire situation.
Winfree said that while having
the Final Four here might help the
city of Detroit, it may not benefit
the entire state of Michigan. Since
many people are coming from Lan-
sing because Michigan State is
competing, he said Detroit will get
that additional business, but the
state of Michigan will not see an
influx of money.

The economic effects of such
events, Winfree said, also depend
on other factors.
"How many of the businesses
involved will be local ones and how
much money will actually stay in
'Detroit are interesting questions,"
he said. "If the company's head-
quarters are in Detroit, that makes
a big difference to the city."
He said having events like the
Final Four also carries a big price
tag for the city.
"Most of the time the city spends
alot of money getting the event into
the city," he said, adding that such
funding isn't always rewarded with
a relative economic boost.
While Winfree says the games'
economic impact might not be

Congress votes on Gov. indicted on

budget alternatives
The Democratic-controlled
House approved a budget blueprint
drawn to President Barack Obama's
specifications yesterday and the
Senate hastened to follow suit after
administration allies rejected alter-
natives from liberals and conserva-
tives alike.
The vote in the House was 233-
196, largely along party lines, for
a $3.6 trillion plan that includes a
deficit of $1.2 trillion.
The country wants "real change,
and we have come here to make a
difference," House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., said as both cham-
bers worked on plans to boost
spending on domestic programs,
raise taxes on the wealthy in two
years' time and clear the way for
action later in the year on Obama's
priority items of health care, ener-
gy and education.
Republicans in both houses
accused Democrats of drafting
plans that would hurt the reces-
sion-ravaged economy in the long
run, rather than help it, and saddle
future generations with too much
debt.
WASHINGTON
Study finds Arctic
ice melting faster
than expected
Arctic sea ice is melting so fast
most of it could be gone in 30 years.
A new analysis of changing con-
ditions in the region, using complex
computer models of weather and
climate, says conditions that had
been forecast by the end of the cen-
tury could occur much sooner.
A change in the amount of ice
is important because the white
surface reflects sunlight back into
space. When ice is replaced by dark
ocean water that sunlight can be
absorbed, warming the water and
increasing the warming of the
planet.
The finding adds to concern
about climate change caused by
human activities such as burn-
ing fossil fuels, a problem that has
begun receiving more attention in
the Obama administration and is
part of the G20 discussions under
way in Landon.
"Due to the recent loss of sea ice,
the 2005-2008 autumn central Arc-
tic surface air temperatures were
greater than 5 degrees Celsius (9
degrees Fahrenheit) above" what
would be expected, the new study
reports.
That amount of temperature
increase had been expected by the
year 207O.

Alcohol sales rose
along with Red River
In the debate over which busi-
nesses are essential during an
emergency, manylocal liquorstores
and bars had no doubt about where
they fell during the Red River flood
threat.
"It's been like New Year's Eve,"
Andy Urton said, manning the
counter at Village West Liquors,
where he rang up $4,000 in sales in
the first two hours he was open one
recent day as people lined up to buy
beer by the case to fuel sandbag-

ging efforts or 1.75-liter bottles of
vodka to ease the aches and stress
of flood preparation.
Self-medication with alcohol
during crises worries mental health
experts, who say it can lead to long-
term problems. But in an upper
Midwest state where drinking is a
popular pastime during the long,
cold winters, it only makes sense to
some residents.
"You've got to do it," said Brian
Jorgensen, 39. "You kind of hurt at
the end of the day."

Cross-border group
created to stop illegal
gun, drug flow
CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP)
- The U.S. and Mexico are cre-
ating a cross-border group to
develop strategies for stopping
the illegal flow of guns and drugs
between the two countries, offi-
cials said yesterday.
Emerging from a conference
with U.S. officials, Mexican
Attorney General Eduardo Med-
ina-Mora said more meetings are
needed to develop plans to bring
warring drug cartels under con-
trol along the border.
Medina-Mora said Mexico
planned to begin checking 10
percent of the vehicles entering
the country from the U.S. for
illegal weapons and will more
closely check outgoing vehicles
for drugs and money.
Medina-Mora said the new
vehicle-inspection measures
were part of Mexico's overall
$1.4 billion modernization of

border customs and crossing
points. The first such vehicle
checks are already being car-
ried out in Matamoros, across
the border from Brownsville,
Texas.
Medina-Mora also said there
had about 1,600 drug-related
killings in Mexico in the first
quarter of 2009, about 25 per-
cent less than the last quarter of
2008. He did notgive a reason for
the decline, but the government
says violence has decreased in
border cities like Ciudad Juarez
after thousands of additional
army troops were sent there ear-
lier this year.
U.S. Homeland Security Sec-
retary Janet Napolitano said
that, in addition to beefing up
border inspections north of the
border, "we have to do more to
reduce demand for drugs."
Napolitano and U.S. Attorney
General Eric Holder metprivate-
ly for several hours with Medi-
na-Mora and Mexico's Interior
Minister Fernando Gomez-Mont
and Public Safety Secretary
Genaro Garcia Luna.

GM bondholders
hold roughly $28B in
unsecured debt
DETROIT (AP) - General
Motors Corp. has prepared a new
proposal for bondholders that aims
to satisfy the government's demand
for much deeper givebacks from
creditors, and the company also is
working on a new concession pack-
age for the United Auto Workers,
according to two people briefed on
the plans.
The offer to the bondholders,
who hold roughly $28 billion in
unsecured General Motors debt,
will exceed a previous government
requirement that GM swap two-
thirds of its unsecured debt for
company stock, one of the people
said.
Both people spoke on condition
of anonymity because the negotia-
tions are private.
GM and Chrysler LLC have
received $17.4 billion in govern-
ment loans to fund their operations
but the companies are trying to
slash costs and debt levels to stave
off bankruptcy. President Barack
Obama said Monday the carmak-
ers' recently submitted restructur-
ing plans failed to go far enough
and gave them strict deadlines to

win more concessions from their
stakeholders.
The concessions demanded by
the White House go deeper than
what was required by the Bush
administration under the original
terms of the government's loans in
December.
The government gave GM until
June 1 to further restructure or
face bankruptcy. Chrysler was
deemed unable to stand on its own
and was given until April 30 to
forge an alliance with Fiat Group
SpA or another company. Without
an alliance, no more government
money will be spent and Chrysler
almost certainly would be sold off
to pay creditors.
Both companies had a tentative
deal with the UAW on wages, ben-
efits and other issues, but the pacts
were never presented to union
members because both sides failed
to reach a deal on swapping stock
for half of the company's required
payments into a union-run trust
that will take over retiree health
care costs next year. The trust is
called a voluntary employee ben-
eficiary association, or VEBA.
At GM, there are no formal
negotiations underway with the
union as the company awaits fur-
ther guidance from the adminis-
tration's autos task force on just
how deep further cuts mustbe, one

of the people said.
It appears the government is
going to seek more cuts from older
blue-collar workers.
Jared Bernstein, Vice President
Joe Biden's chief economist and
a task force member, said in an
interview Tuesday with WWJ-AM
in Detroit that additional conces-
sions may be necessary from older
members of the UAW. He noted the
union had already made significant
cuts for entry-level workers.
"Those concessions arelockedin
at a level that's extremely competi-
tive, so they've come to the table in
that regard. I think there are still
some issues with older workers
and especially if you look at the full
compensation package, including
the VEBA," he said.
Bernstein said the UAW's past
concessions have been "deep, sig-
nificant and important. That said,
most of those concessions apply
to new workers, entry-level work-
ers coming in. There are still lots
of workers who are older, more
experienced and still benefit from
contracts that were signed a long
time ago."
In a landmark 2007 contract,
the UAW preserved wages of older
workers but agreed to the health
care trust and lower wages and
benefits for many newly hired
workers.

A poor policy for colleges
Schools should accept more disadvantaged students
T he University isn't the only college with money troubles.
Some universities, faced with shrinking budgets and an
increasing number of students in need of financial aid,
are even resorting to the poor practice of determining admissions
based on which students can better afford college. This means that
wealthier students who can pay for their education could be more
likely to gain admittance into college than a student who would
require financial aid. While certainly a cost-saving move, univer-
sities should steer away from this policy because it stands in the
way of providing the less advantaged with an equal opportunity
for education.

Dumping dating advice

According to an article in The New York
Times on March 30, some colleges are now
considering students' abilityto paytuition as
one of the deciding factors in the admissions
process. Among the colleges are Brandeis
University in Massachusetts and Bowdoin
College in Maine. One way these universi-
ties are implementing this new policy is by
increasing the admissions of students who
are more likely to pay the full cost - like
transfer, wait-listed and international stu-
dents. The article also clarified that finan-
cial ability becomes a factor for "students at
the margins, the ones who would probably
be 'maybes' when the admissions commit-
tee considered applications."
Though the colleges using this new
policy have admitted that it would hinder
socioeconomic diversity on their campus-
es, many argue that the current economic
crisis leaves them with few options. They
asser they will not be cutting down on
financial aid. Instead, accepting more stu-
dents at full cost allows them to afford the
higher number of students who need finan-
cial aid.
But admissions shouldn't ever favor stu-
dents merely because they are wealthy. In
fact, less financially advantaged students
are in greater need of college educations.
Higher education works to bridge socio-
economic gaps and stop cycles of poverty.
Quality education gives students, regard-
less of current economic standing, a chance

for better jobs and a better future.
And in times of economic crisis, the need
to make higher education available for every-
one is even more crucial. The only way to heal
the floundering economy is to give the least
advantaged members of society equal access
to opportunity. As the manufacturing-based
economy fails, is an economy based in new
industries like economic energy and research
is emerging. These industries require work-
ers with college degrees. And leaving disad-
vantaged students out of this trend will only
widen the destructive wealth inequality in
this country.
Policies that favor wealthy students are
also often blatantly shallow. In the Times
article, Steven Syverson, the dean of admis-
sions and financial aid at Lawrence Univer-
sity in Wisconsin, said, "We're only human,
they shine a little brighter." But students
from less advantaged backgrounds offer
unique outlooks and a diverse perspective
that benefit university communities.
Admittedly, universities struggling
to make ends meet are going to have to
cut costs somewhere. But increasing the
admission of students who can pay the
full price sacrifices the point of educa-
tion. Instead of taking the easy way out by
selecting financially stable students and
ignoring the plights of others, colleges
should not deviate from the very necessary
goal of accepting qualified students of all
economic backgrounds.

'11 be honest. I'm pretty bad at

things don't work out very often. And
I think there are many guys and girls
who feel this way about themselves.
Dating is hard.
So what do we unsuccessful dat-
ers do? We get advice about what to
do from friends. We try to compare
notes and benchmark our progress
against what we consider to be an
ideal courtship. We analyze every
moment of every interaction with
prospective significant others. We
send text messages by committee and
script phone conversations as a team.
Surely two heads must be better than
one, we think.
Well, we're wrong. I'm going to
avoid dating advice as much as I can
from now on. I've realized that almost
all of it is poorly informed, not appli-
cable or downright terrible.
In fact, most of the dating advice I
receive usually makes things worse. I
think it makes the process much more
stressful. Getting advice about dat-
ing can be paralyzing because it's so
easy to build anxiety by talking about

our relationships. Instead of reduc-
ing awkwardness, dating advice does
the opposite because it adds nervous
pressure to the mix and makes me
more awkward and self-conscious.
I polled several friends with one
question: Have you ever received any
good dating advice? They looked at
each other and thought about it for a
few moments. Then, with surprised
looks on their faces, they replied that
they hadn't. I haven't either, and I
don't think many have. Getting sound
dating advice is tremendously diffi-
cult because of the level of nuance in.
the interactions between two people.
It's hard for the periled dater to artic-
ulate the proper contextual details,
and for the well-intentioned adviser
to have enough information to give
relevant advice. Intensive conversa-
tions don't happen in everyday dat-
ing strategy discussions between
friends.
You'd think that if anyone would be
able to deliver good dating advice, it
would be successful couples. But two
friends of mine who are engaged and
have a strong relationship noted that
people in healthy relationships don't
often know how they got into them in
the first place.
Relationships rarely are forced or
contrived. Rather, they spontaneous-
ly emerge within mostly uncontrol-
lable circumstances. If so, how would
anyone, regardless of how much of a
dating expert they are, be able to give
good dating advice?
Take the example of writing to a
dating advice columnist. A reader
submits a brief letter about their
troubles. Then the advice columnist
delivers a response which tries to
solve what might be a deeply compli-

cated relationship problem - in 750
words or less. Reducing the complex-
ity of human relationships to easily
dispensable sound bytes is as point-
less in an advice column as it is in a
simple conversation.
There are some bits of advice that
Friends probably
aren't so lucky
in love, either.
I consider to be important, like being
yourself, not trying too hard, being
open to meeting people and being
faithful, for example. It doesn't take
a long conversation to discover these
truths. They are truisms about dat-
ing that are conveyed to people at a
young age.
That isn't to say that abstaining
from discussions about dating is the
right idea either, even if most dating
advice is ill-conceived. Talking about
dating brings people closer together
and can help build the confidence to
keep on trying. Sometimes we need
a reminder of dating truisms, and
there's nothing wrong with venting.
For every nine pieces of bad advice,
there might beone good piece.
When it comes to dating advice,
one thing is true - buyer beware.
How you act on the advice you get
might determine whether or not you
have dinner plans next Friday.

Doing somethingfor Detroit

Most people would agree that the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan are causing great stress
on our country, whether or not they believe
those wars are necessary. But there is another
war that America is fighting that is not merely
difficult but actually impossible to win - the
War on Drugs.
The War on Drugs is now entering its 40th
year in U.S. policy, making it our nation's lon-
gest-running war. And though extravagant
efforts have been made to eliminate the supply
of certain drugs, we have not seen great reduc-
tion in their availability. Drug enforcement
teams may occasionally catch a large supplier
but another criminal entrepreneur always fills
the position.
So what can we do when efforts to eliminate
drugs appear futile? First, the war's goal must
be clarified. Is our goal to simply reduce drug
use to an absolute minimum, even if that leads
to increases in violence and crime?
All aspects considered, the goal should be
to reduce overall harm to society, taking into
account the harms caused by drug abuse and by
enforcement of drug laws. I say "harms caused
by enforcement" because many drug-related
problems in our society are not a result of drug
use itself but rather of the surrounding poli-
cies - namely, prohibition. Prohibition creates
the black market that funds gangs and cartels.
This has led to massive amounts of violence in
the U.S. and other countries. In Mexico, the
drug war is escalating, and prohibition-related
deaths last year numbered in the thousands.
This violence happened during the prohibi-
tion of alcohol and it's happening again with
the prohibition of other drugs. So how is this
current situation different? Unfortunately, the
Drug War has been going on for so long in our
society that people lack the imagination of a
society where drugs are legal. This was not the
case when alcohol prohibition was repealed.
This is one of the main reasons people cur-
rently fear the legalization of drugs. It seems as

though talking about drugs is also taboo, and
this certainly hinders any productive discus-
sion on how they should be treated in society.
Fortunately, the topic of legalization, par-
ticularly with regard to marijuana, is begin-
ning to be discussed in a much more open and
honest manner. As the executive director of the
University's Students for Sensible Drug Policy
chapter, I couldn't be happier. The drug policy
reform movement is growing extraordinarily
fast, and SSDP is experiencing outstanding
development and growth. We now have over
150 chapters at universities across the U.S.,
with a network building in Canada, as well as
parts of Europe and Africa. Our chapters often
work on local initiatives and campaigns as well
as organize educational events.
The SSDP chapter at the University is host-
ing the regional conference for all Midwestern
chapters this Sunday. The event is open to the
public and will be a great opportunity for edu-
cation as well as networking. More information
on the conference and registration is available
at our website, ww.umdrugpolicy.org.
I would like to point out one last thing - I
often get asked if the SSDP organizes Hash
Bash. The answer is, simply, no. Actually, it's
more like, "No!" (for the hundredth time).
Hash Bash is mainly a cultural event, and SSDP
is strictly a political organization. Our concern
is drug policy, not drug use. It's important to
understand that although marijuana smokers
are a part of the drug policy reform movement,
we are much more than that.
I would rather see people going to the Mich-
igan Social Justice Conference on Saturday
instead, which will actually includea workshop
with SSDP. Making a difference and changing
the world for the better gives me the best high
there is. Attend the conference on Saturday or
our Midwest SSDP Conference on Sunday, and
you may just experience that yourself.

Growing up in Ann Arbor,
I've always experienced the
state's steady decline into
recession at arm's
length. The Uni-
versity has in many
ways buffered this
city economically.
Althougheachbusi-
ness and individual O
is under increasing
fiscal pressure, the
fabric of the city is
strong. MEG
Despite Michi- YOUNG
gan's renowned
woes, the Univer-
sity has been setting
records for fundraising, creating the
nation's fastest-growing endowment
over the last 20 years. The amoung of
money spent is tangible - construction
on campus has reached a fever pitch.
Students usually don't have means
of transportation outside of campus,
let alone Ann Arbor. This insulates
us from the rest of the state at a time
when we need to be aware of what
we'll return to when we leave our
ivory tower.
Don't let me generalize about your
experience. Students are finding it
more difficult to find jobs and to pay
for rent, food and tuition. We don't
need to go to Detroit to find problems.
But you can't deny the stark contrast
between these two cities, even though
Detroit is a mere 40 minutes away.
Michigan was in recession long
before the rest of the country. At
the moment, Detroit is synonymous
with the failing auto industry and
the ripple effect those lost jobs have
on Michigan communities. In fact,
Detroit's hardships can be traced to
more than a recession or lost auto
jobs.
But thankfully, people at the Uni-

versity are beginning to forge oppor-
tunities to volunteer or do social
justice work, especially in Detroit.
The work is certainly only symbolic if
it's not directed by or in collaboration
with Detroit residents. When Ann
Arbor students get involved on their
own, they are showing their com-
mitment to Detroit because they are
understand its importance.
The Detroit Partnership creates
opportunities for service learning
in the city. Its website speaks to the
value it places in long-term insti-
tutional relationships, reciprocity
and reflective self-awareness. Other
campus student groups are getting
involved, from the labor activist
group Students Organizing for Labor
and Economic Equality's poll-watch-
ing in the presidential election to the
Ross School of Business's Net Impact
group planting trees with Greening
of Detroit this Saturday.
Increasingly, classes have been
offered exclusively in Detroit. Some
have become a "study abroad" expe-
rience. Semester in Detroit brings
Wayne State's campus and Residen-
tial College professors together. Each
student takes a job in a city commu-
nity or cultural organization.
Some classes aren't focused specif-
ically on Detroit, but the city is inevi-
tably brought to the forefront. Last
semester, four people in Prof. Rebec-
ca Hardin's corporate ethnography
seminar wrote research-intensive
papers on environmental justice in
Detroit. In the Global Change class,
Prof. Tom Gladwin of the Business
School wrapped up his final lecture
with a discussion of global inequality
and how it is reflected in Ann Arbor
and Detroit. He called on us all to do
something.
"Givingback" hasn'tbeen apriority
for most students for various reasons.

We're all very busy. No doubt, stu-
dents have more power after getting
their degrees, but gaining communi-
ty service experience while we are in
school can actually help to shape our
goals. It's also a place where problems
are abstract or analyzed statistically,
or felt to be too complex to be able
to change. It's amazing to me to see
people at the University recognize a
responsibility, or at least an ability, to
act.
What those inside
the bubble can do
for those outside.
Others see the quality of a Univer-
sity degree as the only reimbursement
Michigan needs. Higher education
creates human capital that has the
potential to attract high-paying sci-
ence-based technologies back to the
state.
It would be nice to be able to say
that we owe something to the state,
because we go to such a phenomenal,
tax-supported public University. But
our tuition is rising, as is corporate
research funding, and private donors
are dealing out luxury facilities with
their name attached. Public funding
is in long-term decline.
Regardless of your reasons, try
to find a way out of the Ann Arbor
bubble - and especially into service
work in Detroit. Professors aren't the
only people we should learn from in
this time.

Fusing fashion and
community service

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
DailyArts Writer
While most style-conscious women
shop and read fashion magazines for
leisure, the girls who make up NOiR's
executive board approach the fash-
ion industry with a
completely different , s
conviction. NUR fashion
"Fashion's impor- show

even if you like $12
different types of
fashion," NOiR Pro-
duction Director Alexandria Glispie
explained. "Everybody kind ofhas their
own style and their own fashion sense
even if they aren't aware of it."
Glispie is one of seven executive
members of NOiR, one of the Univer-
sity's many fashion-oriented student
organizations. And although the group
is devoted to showing Ann Arbor the
latest trends, that's only a small part
of what the group is about. NOiR inte-
grates fashion with community service
to propel awareness for many social
issues - past ventures have included
raising awareness for HIV/AIDS and
domestic violence. It's clear the mem-
bers see the fashion industry as a vehi-
cle for change.
"I think it's a great way to commu-
} nicate your opinion without words,"
said Ashley Lee, LSA sophomore and
NOiR's finance director. "It's a way to
give a specific message without having
to write it down to get it out."
With a fall semester geared toward
awareness campaigns, winter semester
for NOiR is a hectic effort to produce
a runway show that stays fashion-for-
ward while displaying the importance
of a chosen charity.
This year's focus is on the envi-
ronment, and the executive board
has been working all semester to put
together its 10th annual fashion show,
titled "Decadence." The show will run
inthe UnionBallroom at7p.m. on Sun-
day with an after party at 5th Quarter.
Tickets are $12 and all proceeds from
both the show and party will go to The
Nature Conservancy to help prevent
deforestation.
Perhaps just as notable as NOiR's
commitment to social awareness is
the grandiose nature of its student-run
show.
"There's around 55 or 60 models -
it's a big show this year," NOiR Creative
Director Brittany Kozerski said. All
the models are students, chosen in a
December tryout.
Not only will the NOiR show ben-
efit a great cause, but it's also a chance
for local designers and models to show
their work. The clothes are all provid-
ed by local boutiques and designers,
and students from Eastern Michigan
University and Wayne State Univer-

sity are also showing their creations.
With former NOiR participants hav-
ing moved on to professional modeling
and designing careers (including NOiR
founder and University alum Maryam
Basir), those involved with the show
are hoping it will be another small step
toward making it big.
Evette Hollins, NOiR director of
business affairs, explained the outlet
that comes with participating in a NOiR
fashion show: "NOiR is an opportunity
for students on this campus to express
a creative side that they wouldn't nor-
mally be able to because we don't have
a fashion curriculum at the University
of Michigan. So we try to give students
an opportunity to get involved in all
aspects - students as models, students
as designers."
"It's really good experience to go
into the professional world - I want to
go into fashion journalism," Kozerski
added. "Soit's really helped, just having
the leadership experience."
With such a large show, Hollins and
her colleagues hope to cater to as many
individual tastes as possible.
"This show in particular, we're try-
ing to cover different personalities,"
she said. "I want everyone to come to
the show and be able to find someone
who they aspire to look like or some
sort of style they connect with."
Social awareness
is stylish.
They promise the show will include
everything from swimwear and linge-
rie to casual and party looks.
It's NOiR's enthusiasm forboth fash-
ion and the University that has driven it
to create such a large-scale show.
"The University of Michigan is very
diverse and here we try to reflect that
in our shows," Glispie said. "This is the
number one public university in the
nation, and we try to portray that by
being the number one fashion show.
We're trying to make it as big as the
school is to reflect all the students."
Despite their desire to create an
amazing show, NOiR's members never
lose sight of their main goal. They
truly understand the power of fashion.
Whether they see clothes as a means to
unite a diverse campus or as a way of
communicating new ideas, they under-
stand the importance of social aware-
ness and love what they're doing at the
same time.
NOiR Director of Social Affairs
Danielle McDowell said it best when
explaining how she became involved
with the organization: "Being able to
come here and fuse fashion and com-
munity service together, I thought it
was just a great organization to be a
part of."

"Behind my mirrored sunglasses, I'm undressing you with my eyes."

Fever Ray, it's clearly not a party album. It's
more of an introspective, alone-in-your-

Unfortunate-
ly, the stunning display of stra-
tegic cinematography evident in
the film's introduction is quickly
forgotten, as the film digresses
from the action and unsuccess-
fully attempts to get serious.
Vin Diesel ("Pitch Black")
and Paul Walker ("Flags of Our
Fathers") return to reprise their
roles for a fourth installment in
the series that carries the con-
cept of hegemonic masculinity to
obscene extremes while inducing
laughter at inopportune times.
The plot focuses on Domi-
nic Toretto (Diesel), a playboy
con man who steals to feed his
adrenaline addiction, which he

apparently also satiates via ille-
gal street racing. In the course
of the film, a tragic occurrence
forces Toretto to salvage his
strained relationship with law
officer Brian O'Conner (Walker)
to bring a barbarous heroin deal-
er to justice. Director Justin Lin
("Better Luck Tomorrow") bor-
rows heavily from popular action
films of the 1980s to create his
own cheesy montage of melodra-
ma with forced acting and cliche
quips to boot.
In spite of the film's all-too-
apparent flaws, it seems to pos-

The "alpha male" roles played by
Diesel and Walker entail

CENSUS
From Page 1
"Groves is an excellent choice
for this important job," Jackson
wrote in the statement, "and he
will be sorely missed at ISR if con-
firmed for the job at Census."
With an extensive background in
survey research, Groves, who served
as associate director of the Census
Bureau from 1990 to 1992, will take
up his new position amid some polit-
icalconcernaboutpossiblestatistical
adjustments tothe2010 census.
To some, Groves is a controver-
sial pick for the position. As the
Census Bureau's associate direc-
tor during the 1990 census, Groves
proposed a statistical adjustment
that would make up for an esti-
mated 5 million undercounted
people, made up mainly of urban
minorities who typically support
the Democratic Party.
Congress denied the statistical
readjustment in 1990, after critics
of the change claimed it was politi-
cally motivated. Members of the
} Republican Party feared that such
readjustment would factor into
reapportionment of seats in the
House of Representatives:
Despite the renewal of such con-
cerns, Commerce Secretary Gary
Locke - who oversees the census
- said there are no current plans

as clear as some have predicted,
he noted the city's economy will
receive some benefit.
"Hotels will be booked, the
event will bring outside business-
es, and it will give Detroit good
publicity," he said. "It could have
positive long-term effects."
He added: "It is a good political
move."
In addition to the economic
role of the games, Kinesiology
Prof. Bettina Cornwell said that
the event is great for community
building.
"All events of this magnitude
are good for the community," she
said. "It will be an upbeat, positive
event, and during a time of eco-
nomic downturn for the state -
this is just what the city needs."

for district reapportionment, and
that sampling adjustments would
he more geared toward measuring
the accuracy of the current census,
according to The Associated Press.
Vincent Hutchings, a Political
Science professor and research
associate professor for the Cen-
ter for Political Studies, said in an
interview yesterday that he believes
Groves is likelyto include the statis-
tical adjustments that he has pro-
posed in the past if appointed.
"I know that as a survey
researcher, he is very familiar
with and isvery sensitive tounder-
counts," Hutchings said. "At the
end of the day, the census is just a
survey and it doesn't count every-
one, it has its flaws."
Hutchings said that although
"the people who are typically
undercounted are racial minori-
ties, and these are often consid-
ered voters for the Democratic

purpose of the relay is to not only
remember and honor loved ones

raising funds for researchers like

2,956 participants from 193 teams

have registered for the event, sur-

pated last year.
Education sophomore Ari Beers,
who is a co-captain of a team with
11 of her friends, said she decided to
participate in Relayfor Life because
her mom had a breast cancer scare
at the beginning of the year.
While her mother's results came
back negative, Beers said the expe-
rience motivated her to reach out
to others going through similar
situations.
"She didn't even have it so I can't
imagine what other people who are
actually battling the actual disease
are going through," she said.
Schepeler said she has partici-
pated in Relay for Life the pastnine
years because "it is a cause that is
near and dear" to her heart, and
she couldn't see her life without it.
"Every year you kind of reach
this epiphany where you're stand-
ing on the field, you're looking out
at thousands and thousands of peo-
ple, and you just realize that in any
other day you wouldn't be connect-
ed to themby any means," she said,
"but you can look at someone and
just smile and nod and say 'We're
here for the same reason, we're
fighting back,' and for that moment
you're connected."


CONTRACT
From Page 1
0.3 percent of the college's entire
compensation for 2005 and 2.8
percent for 2007, the value of the
"Super C Fund" shot up to 30.4 per-
cent of LSA's total compensation
in 2008 and 20.6 percent in 2009.
Awards from the "Super C Fund"
are also recommended by the
department and must be approved
by the dean.
American Culture and History
Lecturer Catherine Daligga, co-
chair of LEO, said in an interview
yesterday that LEO determined
University officials were switching
money from the "A Fund," where
money for salary increases is usu-
ally housed, to the "C Fund," which
University officials say they use for
retention, promotion and equity.
The categories of retention, pro-
motion and equity are excepted
from consideration in pay raises for
lecturers according to the union's
contract with the University.
Because the University moved
money to the "C Fund" and "Super C
Fund," lecturers' salaries increased
by 2 percent, instead of by 4.1 per-
cent, Daligga and LEO contend.
Frumkin described the conten-
tion between the two parties dif-
ferently.
The University's position, Frum-
kin said in an interview yesterday,

is that officials admittedly did not
take into account the "C Fund"
because money in that fund falls
under three categories that are
exempt from consideration accord-
ing to the LEO contract.
Thus despite LEO's objections,
he said, University officials are
abiding by the contract they agreed
upon with LEO.
As stipulated in the labor agree-
ment, which expires in 2010, the
University must increase lecturers'
pay at the same rate it raises pay for
professors, or tenure-track faculty.
"All Employee full-time salary
rates shall increase by the average
annual percent increase, excluding
retention, promotion, and equity
increases, for tenured and tenure-
track faculty of the respective arts
and sciences college at each cam-
pus," the agreement reads.
Therefore if the University were
taking money that should be con-
sidered in pay raises, and putting
it into an eiempt fund, as LEO
suggests, they would be breaching
their contract with the union.
Daligga saic-LEO-officials dis-
covered what they contend is a dis-
crepancy in the funds in a Freedom
of Information Act request, which
they submitted in August.
"We found out that they were in
fact making use of some creative
accountingsystems, using a variety
of funds that had been established,
using them in a different way than

they had been explained to us," she
said. "The A Fund balances started
to dwindle and the money in the C
and Super C (another of the four
fund pools) fund were growing."
Following their finding in the
FOIA request, Daligga said LEO
filed a grievance claiming the Uni-
versity breached the contract.
On Wednesday, LEO mem-
bers and University officials were
scheduled to meet in hopes of set-
tling the dispute, but the meeting
was cancelled after University offi-
cials determined that a settlement
would not be the best way to resolve
the conflict, Frumkin said.
LEO officials filed the demand
for arbitration on Wednesday.
Though Frumkin reiterated sev-
eral times the high variability in the
schedules of arbitration hearings, he
said he hoped the hearing would be
held in late May or early June, add-
ing that neither side has any interest
in "having this linger." He also said
a decision by the arbiter is usually
made within 30 days of the hearing.
Frumkin said LEO scheduled a
teach-in for Tuesday and Wednes-
day of this past week, which Uni-
versity officials said would be a
violation of the union's contract.
LEO officials told Frumkin they
would suspend the teach-in if Uni-
versity officials would agree to talk
about a possible settlement.
Frumkin said that while a settle-
ment was discussed in advance of

Wednesday's scheduled meeting,
University officials decided that the
settlement would not be the best
way to solve the dispute. He said he
communicated his decision to LEO
officials Wednesday morning.
"This is not something that hap-
pens often. In fact, to the best of my
knowledge it is the first time in the
11 years I've been here'that I have
cancelled a meeting and said that
we're not going to go forward with
the agenda we had planned," he
said. "It's unfortunate, I wish that
it hadn't played out the way that it
played out, but it did."
Yesterday LEO staged a rally on
Regents' Plaza featuring speakers
from student groups Stop the Hike
and Students Organizing for Labor
and Economic Equality to call
attention to the union's demands.
Surrounded by about 40 lectur-
ers and students, Marc Ammer-
laan, co-chair of LEO and a Biology
lecturer, lamented the University's
handling of the situation.
"The University writes one set of
words on paper, and goes in some
windowless office and makes up a
different set of rules," he said. "If
it's a good year, we'll take good
pay; if it's a bad year, we'll take low
raises, but we don't want to see the
scales tipping based on who the
administration favors."

that he thinks the incoming execu-
tive board can help ensure repre-
sentatives attend and contribute
to meetings by making them more
productive and conducive to open
dialogue.
"I think a lot of getting atten-
dance up has to do with the way
the meetings are carried out," he
said. "We need to make them more
efficient, more open and make
people feel comfortable in them
where they feel comfortable speak-
ing up."

Mahanti said many absences are
accumulated by representatives
from schools where it's more dif-
ficult for MSA to recruit replace-
ments, like theSchool of Nursing
and Rackham Graduate School.
It's often easier for executives to
excuse the issue than to find new
representatives to replace them,
which is a separate and concerning
issue, he said.
Mahanti said it's "absolutely
inexcusable" to delay replacing
seats that are more difficult to get,
like Engineering and LSA, once
representatives holdingthem reach
the maximum number of absences.
He said that it is the executive

board's responsibility to ensure the
seats are replaced in a timely fash-
ion.
"It's definitely a problem, and I
think it becomes a delegation prob-
lem," Mahanti said. "(Representa-
tives) need to be held accountable
for their absences and know the
consequences."
To increase visibility and raise
attendance, Mahanti said the
executives will be more hands-on
in informing individuals who have
accrued too many absences. They
will also place the Google docu-
ment, which records attendance,
on MSA's website so individuals
know where they stand.

Though MSA's Constitution
and compiled code lay out spe-
cific guidelines for removing
representatives who do not par-
ticipate enough and accumulate
a large number of absences, few
representatives are actually dis-
missed from the assembly for this
reason.
"More often than not, indi-
viduals find a way to get some of
those absences excused from their
record so that they aren't directly
kicked out," Benson said. "Actual
removal does not happen very
often."
MSA's compiled code states that
after representatives accumulate
12 absences, the Rules and Elec-
tions Committee must notify them
in writing, detailing the type and
date of each absence and the proce-
dure to excuse absences.
Representatives then have two
weeks following this notification
to have their absences excused. If
they remain absent or do not have
the absences excused, they maybe
removed from the assembly.
Absences can be excused in the
event of illness, if the representa-
tive has an exam at the same time
as the MSA obligation or if there is
a death in the family. Exceptions to
this can be granted by a two-thirds
majority vote from the assembly or
from the Steering Committee.
Representatives can appeal
each absence after they collect 12
absences. Benson said occasionally
individuals who accumulate more
than this maximum will go to the
Steering Committee to have them
excused, usually they resign.
"People come and fight it or they
just resign," he said. "It's pretty
rare that someone who hits 13,
14, 15 absences will just keep on
going."
According to MSA's Constitu-
tion, representatives are required
to take part in multiple activities
on a weekly basis, with extra duties
during election time. Represen-
tatives must attend MSA weekly
meetings, participate inat least one
committee or commission meeting
a week, hold one office hour a week
in the MSA office and work for four
hours at a polling site during elec-
tions.

Forcier finding his groove
with first-string offense

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
While meeting with reporters
for the first time since becoming
the Michigan football team's first-
string quarterback, early-enrollee
Tate Forcier couldn't stop smiling.
The freshman answered each
question excitedly - and he could
afford to.
With quarterback Steven
Threet's trans-
fer and redshirt NOTEBOOK
junior quarter-
back Nick Sheridan out for three
to five more weeks with a right
leg fracture, Forcier is taking the
majority of snaps with the first-
team offense this spring.
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
has stressed the quarterback com-
petition will depend more on the
fall than the spring, but after just a
few weeks in Rodriguez's system,
the dual-threat quarterback has
impressed many.
"He's catching on real fast,"
senior running back Brandon
Minor said. "The first week, you
thought he was kind of slow. He
wasn't running fast, but he was
just trying to get used to the plays.
Once he got those down, you could
see his speed. And his arm, too.
He's got a lot of potential."
In high school, Forcier focused
on improving his speed. This
spring, his training has been
focused on bulking up his 6-foot-
1, 187-pound frame with Michigan
strength and conditioning coach
Mike Barwis.
Quarterback Pat White, who
played for Rodriguez at West
Virginia from 2005 to 2007, was
6-foot-1 and 180 pounds in his first
season with the Mountaineers.
Forcier said his biggest chal-
lenges this spring have been the
speed of the college game and

adjusting to taller linemen. Last
summer, Forcier worked out with
6-foot quarterback Drew Brees.
The three-time Pro Bowler had a
few tips.
"He said, 'You're not going to
throw over guys, you're going to
throw in the windows, in between
guys,' "Forcier recalled.
Although he's watching practice
from the sidelines, Sheridan, who
played in eight games last season,
has taken Forcier under his wing.
"I have Nick right after every
play, telling me what I need to do,
what I can do to do better," Forcier
said. "Even if it's a successful play,
what else I can do to make it even
better than that?"
Forcier said the two quarter-
backs talk frequently and hang out
on the weekends. Sheridan is good
friends with Forcier's older broth-
er, Jason, who played for Michigan
in 2005 and 2006 before transfer-
ring to Stanford.
The Forcier-Sheridan competi-
tion won't heat up until Sheridan
is healthy. But Rodriguez thinks
Forcier is playing better than
Sheridan was at this point last
spring.
"He's got Nick andothers around
him knowing what to do," Rodri-
guez said. "Last year, they were all
new in the system, so it was a little
bit tougher on the quarterbacks.
"Regardless, there's going to
be so much competition at the
position in the fall, it's going to
be exciting to watch. But Tate is
certainly making the most of his
opportunity now.",
SPEED DEMON: Early enrollee
running back Vincent Smith has
impressed coaches this spring
with his blazing speed.
At just 5-foot-6, Smith has
shown he may be worthy of play-
ing time this fall.
During the Wolverines' 'M'

drill at Thursday's practice, cones
were set up in a 'V' formation
extending horizontally across the
field. Three pairs lined up with
an offensive lineman blocking
a defensive lineman, a tight end
blocking a linebacker and a wide
receiver blocking a defensive end.
A running back began at the side-
line and tried to run through the
players while staying in the cones.
Smith ran fluidly, breaking
through the line pair by pair with
ease.
"You never know how much a
freshman can contribute early,
and Vincent has a long way to go,"
Rodriguez said. "But just judging
on a few practices, he has the tal-
ent to help us early this year. We'll
see if he can do it."
SMOOTH TRANSITIONS: After
the Wolverine defense gave up a
program-record 28.9 points per
game last year, new defensive
coordinator Greg Robinson now
has a lot on his plate. But Rodri-
guez says the transition seems to
be going smoothly.
"Obviously, some of the termi-
nology is going to be new," Rodri-
guez said. "But because some of
them haven't played a lot before,
it's not as difficult as it is for some-
one who has been in the same
system for three or four years.
I'm most proud of our juniors and
seniors and how quickly they've
adjusted. We've had some mental
busts and missed assignments, but
not nearly as much as you would
think with a new scheme."
COACHES' CLINIC: Rodriguez
will hostthe annual coaches' clinic
this weekend. At Thursday's prac-
tice, about 100 coaches stood along
the sidelines watching and taking
notes. Last year's clinic attracted
nearly 600 coaches, and more will
come to Ann Arbor throughout the
weekend.

Grady to transfer after
playing time dimninishe

By ALEX PROSPERI
and ANDY REID
Daily Sports Writers
Sophomore Kelvin Grady
has decided to leave the Michi-
gan men's basketball team with
the intention of transferring to
another school, Michigan coach
John Beilein said in a statement
released by the Athletic Depart-
ment yesterday.
"Kelvin has asked for his release
from the program and we will
grant that to him," Beilein said
in the statement. "Over the last
two years, he has been a posi-
tive influence in helping build the
foundation of our program. He is
a wonderful young man on and off
the floor. We wish him nothing but
success in the future."
The statement did not say where
he will transfer.
The announcement comes on
the heels of the Wolverines' first
NCAA Tournament appearance

since 1998. Michigan lost to Okla-
homa in the second round. But
Grady saw his playing time severe-
ly decrease during his sophomore
year, including just five combine
minutes in the NCAA Tourna-
ment.
"It's been a wonderful experi-
ence both as a student and as a
player here at the University of
Michigan, but I feel I need a fresh
start," said Grady in the statement.
"I love this university and want to
thank the coaching staff, my team-
mates and everyone else who has
supported me over the past two
years. However, I have decided to
explore other academic and play-
ing opportunities at this time."
This season, Grady started just
eight games, played a total of 574
minutes and sat out three games.
Last year, the Grand Rapids native
started 25-of-32 games, played a
total of 782 minutes and saw action
in every game.
As a sophomore, Grady aver-

aged 4.2 points, 1.9 assists and 1.3
rebounds per game, down from
5.6, 2.8 and 1.9 asa freshman.
Although the team's spirits in
the locker room were high dur-
ing Michigan's run to the post-
season, there was speculation
that Grady wasn't happy with his
playing time. But the players who
took Grady's spot as starting point
guard, fifth-year seniors C.J. Lee
and David Merritt, have run out of
eligibility.
That leaves next year's starting
point guard spot to a slew of play-
ers. Most notably is 6-foot-3-inch,
175-pound incoming freshman
Darius Morris from Windward
High School in Los Angeles. Mor-
ris, a four-star recruit according
to Rivals.com, has already signed
is letter of intent to play for Michi-
gan.
Other players that could fill the
spot are redshirt freshman guard
Laval Lucas-Perry and freshman
guard Stu Douglass.

'M'stays loose before Big Tens

By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
When Kurt Golder coached the
Michigan men's gymnastics team to
the national title in 1999, he sported
a bushy mustache.
Last Thursday at practice, senior
co-captain Phil Goldberg decided
that a mustache
revival might
be just what igTen

Golder didn't TV: BTN
have a chance
to protest. Gold-
berg told the whole team that ifMich-
igan wins the Big Ten Championship,
Golder would regrow the mustache
for NCAA Championships. -
Following the Wolverines' last
regular-season win over Ohio State
on March 21, the coaches wanted to
make sure the fun from their vic-
tory carried through the next two
weeks. So far, it hasn't been much of
a problem.
In a normal week, each gymnast
must perform a certain number of
"competition sets" - full routines
on each of his events done exactly
as if in a meet. Gymnasts call these
routines out to the coaches to be
sure they're being evaluated.
On Thursday, redshirt freshman

Andrew Vance was the first to call
out a "mustache set." Senior Ralph
Rosso, warming up on the pommel
horse, laughed so hard he fell off.
The joking, confident spirit could
help the Wolverines earn their first
Big Ten title since 2000.
In their final regular-season
meet, the team's new attitude
helped Michigan to its highest team
score and highest hit percentage in
Columbus, where it hadn't won in
32 years.
"When you watched us in the 1999
NCAA Championships, you could see
that everybody was having a blast,"
Golder said. "We were the team that
was having the most fun, and every-
thing was falling into place. ... I'm
glad we had that Ohio State meet,
because I think a lot of the guys real-
ly learned a lot from it."
The coach did express concern
that the memory of the victory in
Columbus might fade because of the
two-week layoff
But that seems to be far from the
case. A strong sense of self-assur-
ance has been evident at practices
ever since the team's return, and the
Wolverines are determined to carry
their new outlook into Big Tens.
"I think we've found a whole new
way to do gymnastics as a team,"
sophomore BenBaldus-Strauss said.
"Just enjoying it more than letting it
stress us out and control our minds
so much. Stepping back and look-
ing at the whole sport differently is
really helping our team and bring-
ing us together."

Michigan, which has finished
fourth at Big Tens each of the last
three years, will start the meet
on high bar, an event that's been a
pleasant surprise for much of the
year, and finish on parallel bars.
No. 4 Illinois is expected to give
the Wolverines their toughest com-
petition, with No. 6 Ohio State and
No. 7 Penn State closebehind. Mich-
igan has beaten every Big Ten team
but the Nittany Lions this season.
"Ithinkmaybethetoughestoppo-
nent mightbe ourselves," said senior
Scott Bregman, who will be healthy
for Big Tens for the first time since
his freshman year. "Making sure
we don't put too much pressure on
ourselves and that we just do our
best performances. Let the pressure
elevate our performances instead of
taking them the other way."
Everything seems to be in the
Wolverines' favor. For the first time
since 2005, they're hosting Big
Tens. Even though Michigan hasn't
competed at Crisler since 2005, the
Wolverines feel comfortable there.
All the equipment will be familiar,
either from the Newt Loken Gym-
nastics Training Center or Cliff
Keen Arena. And a majority of the

"Big Tens could be tomorrow and
we would be set," Baldus-Strauss
said last Friday. "We just need to be
able to access what we'vebeen doing
all week in gym and (against Ohio
State) at this meet. If we're able to
tap into that and find that momen-
tum again, we'll be unstoppable."

The Michigan men's tennis
team lost just seven matches last
season.
This past Sunday, with 12 losses
under their helt, the Wolverines
finally grahhed

No. 47 Michigan (1-3 Big Ten,
7-12 overall) squares off against
No. 51 Penn State and No. S Ohio
State at the Varsity Tennis Cen-
ter, returning home for the first
time since dropping a 6-1 deci-
sion to then-No. 23 Wake Forest
on Mar. 7.
"We feel more relaxed at home,
and there is a little better atmo-
sphere playing indoors in-front of
the home crowd," senior co-cap-
tain Peter Aarts said.
The win over Northwestern
halted an eight-match skid, dat-
ing back to the Wolverines' home
victory against Harvard on Feb.
20.
But Berque isn't concerned as
his team face the Nittany Lions
(2-2, 9-8) and Buckeyes (4-0,
20-1).
"We certainly don't have much
room to play around," Berque said.
"With Penn State, we're going to
get the guys to play with a sense
of urgency as if their season is on
the line."
That's exactly what has to hap-

pen this weekend for Michigan to
have any shot at making it to the
NCAA Tournament in May. Last
year, just six of 64 teams made the
tournament with a losing record.
With the Wolverines' next few
matches on the road, this week-
end is a perfect opportunity to
grab a split.
"The rankings are so far from
any indication of what kind of
match we are going,to get," Ber-
que said. "Anyone from 15 to 50
can beat each other on any given
day and usually the match is 4-3,
so if you're not ready to play, it's
getting to be more and more like
college basketball, where the par-
ity is really there and the little
things make a difference."
Berque stresses playing aggres-
sive tennis while minimizing the

amount of unforced errors.
After the Wolverines' recent
victory, their recent confidence
issues have dissipated.
"Everyone is a little more
upbeat and relaxed now," Aarts
said. "You use a whole bunch of
matches in a row and everyone
gets uptight with themselves and
the team. When you win, it relax-
es everyone a little bit."
Despite their relaxed mindset,
the importance of this weekend
cannot be overlooked.
"With (Ohio State) being so
good this year ... it's going to be
something that will be easy to get
up for," Berque said. "But we have
talked almost exclusively about
what we need to do on Saturday
(against Penn State) and that's the
attitude we want to take."
