Before LSA senior Ashley 
Soto entered the University 
of Michigan, she knew she 
wanted to join a culturally-
based sorority on campus. 
Soto, who is now president of 
the University’s Alpha chapter 
of Delta Tau Lambda Sorority, 
Inc., had an opportunity to 
visit the University through the 
sorority’s high school outreach 
program. After her first year, 
she decided to join the sorority. 
“I 
didn’t 
want 
to 
join 
a 
Panhel 
(Panhellenic) 
organization, just because I 
didn’t feel comfortable as a 
black Latina doing that,” Soto 
said. “That’s kind of the reality 
of things for some students 
of color. But, once I found out 
that there was a way of joining 
multicultural 
Greek 
life, 
I 
knew that I had seen a lot of 
people in my community be a 
part of it, and I wanted to be a 
part of that community.” 
Engineering senior Spencer 
Chen had a similar experience 
to Soto, saying though he 
did not intend to join Greek 
life before coming to the 
University, he was able to find a 

community in the Iota chapter 
of 
Asian-American 
interest 
fraternity Pi Alpha Phi, which 
helped him open up to his 
identity. 
“I originally joined because I 
first met a few of the brothers, 
and they were very warm and 
welcoming,” Chen said. “And 
before I came to college … I 
wasn’t very accepting of my 
culture. They helped guide me 
to not only accept myself, but 
embrace it.” 
The National Pan-Hellenic 
Council and the Multicultural 
Greek 
Council 
oversee 
culturally 
based 
fraternal 
organizations 
(CBFOs). 
NPHC, also known as the 
“Divine Nine,” is made up of 
historically African-American 
sororities 
and 
fraternities 
founded during the early 1900s, 
when Black students were not 
permitted to join historically 
white fraternal organizations. 
MGC was founded in 2002 
with the mission of embracing 
multiculturalism and providing 
a space for communities of 
color in Greek life. 
“We were founded based on 
the idea of inclusivity,” Chen 
said. 

Thousands of University of 
Michigan students and local 
community members filled Hill 
Auditorium to hear American 
rapper, actor, philanthropist and 
activist Common speak at the 
Handleman Lecture on Thursday 
night. 
Answering 
questions 
posed by Scott DeRue, dean of 
the Ross School of Business, 
Common discussed how he aims 

to use his platform as a force for 
positive change.
Hosted by the Business School 
and sponsored by the Joseph 
and Sally Handleman Charitable 
Foundation, the annual event 
invites a prominent figure to 
campus each year to speak on 
relevant business topics. As part 
of their curricular activities, all 
first- and second-year Business 
students were required to attend.
Common opened the event by 
sharing how he found his voice 
through rap at the age of 12. 

Seeing the love and joy his work 
brought, Common said he knew 
he wanted to become a rapper 
when he realized his work had 
impact.
“When I found my voice, I 
started to figure out what I stood 
for and who I am,” Common 
said. “My voice really became 
something that I knew was mine 
when I found out it had purpose,” 
When asked about formative 
moments 
in 
his 
childhood, 
Common said learning the story 
of Emmett Till, a Black 14-year-

old who was lynched after being 
accused of whistling at a white 
woman in 1955, has been the 
strongest influence in shaping 
who he is today. 
“Me seeing that as a little kid 
and knowing that he was just like 
me, from Chicago, it made me feel 
like I had to live for something 
greater,” Common said. “It made 
me realize, someone died just 
because he whistled at someone, 
so what am I going to do with this

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Former 
Massachusetts 
Gov. Deval Patrick spoke in 
a 
conversation-style 
event 
about climate change and 
the role of business and 
politics 
in 
environmental 
sustainability. 
The 
event 
was the first installment of 
the Environmental Law & 

Policy Program’s 2019-2020 
Lecture Series.
Patrick, who served as 
governor of Massachusetts 
from 2007 to 2015, first 
discussed 
the 
importance 
of encouraging innovation 
in businesses through the 
government, 
public 
policy 
and impact investing. 
“The kind of innovation 
that is happening in the clean 

and 
alternative 
energy 
I 
think is just wildly exciting,” 
Patrick said. “How do you 
enable the folks who are 
doing this? We need to help 
catalyze the private sector 
with this kind of research. 
… We need to elevate that, 
which is a thing that people 
in senior public positions 
can do by showing up to 
events, understanding what’s 

happening and encouraging.” 
According 
to 
Patrick, 
one of the key faults in 
governing and politics is the 
idea that there can only be 
a single solution for issues 
like climate change, when in 
reality these problems often 
have multiple angles and 
solutions. 

University of Michigan Provost 
Martin Philbert announced a 
campus-wide extended reality 
initiative — an umbrella term for 
augmented, mixed and virtual 
reality technology commonly 
referred to as XR — last week. 
XR 
Initiative 
Director 
and 
University alum, Jeremy Nelson, 
said the technology will enhance 
learning both on campus and 
online.
“These 
are 
advanced 
technologies 
that 
allow 
you 
to 
experience 
different 
environments, 
different 
perspectives in a way that may 
be challenging to do if you’re 
not able to travel somewhere 
or to see inside of an atom,” 
Nelson said. “It opens up lots of 
opportunities for expanding the 
learning experience for students 
and learners around the world.”
Nelson works in the Center 
for Academic Innovation, which 
is spearheading the three-year 
initiative. A new fund will 
support projects related to XR on 
campus.

The Osterman Common 
Room was packed for a 
moderated discussion with 
author 
Artemis 
Leontis 
discussing her new book 
“Eva Palmer Sikelianos: A 
Life in Ruins” on Thursday 
afternoon. 
The 
event 
was 
part 
of the Author’s Forum 
series 
presented 
by 
the 
LSA 
Institute 
for 
the 
Humanities. 
The 
conversation 
was 
moderated by Prof. Yopie 
Prins.
Leontis’s book is the 
first biography about Eva 
Palmer Sikelianos (1874-
1952), an American poet, 
composer 
and 
dancer 

who extensively studied 
Ancient 
Greek 
history. 
Palmer recreated ancient 
art forms, staging Greek 
tragedy 
with 
her 
own 
choreography, 
costumes 
and even music. She was 
most 
famously 
known 
for reviving the Delphic 
Festivals 
in 
Delphi, 
Greece.
The lecture began with 
Leontis 
discussing 
how 
she had been fascinated 
by Palmer’s body of work, 
but how research on her 
artistic process and life 
had been limited. Leontis 
recalls how after getting 
promoted 
to 
associate 
professor at the University 
of Michigan and having 
the 
resources 
of 
the 
Humanities 
Department 

backing her up, she was 
able to start embarking 
on cataloging the life of 
Palmer.
In the early stages of 
her 
research, 
Leontis 
organized an event that 
brought a poet who had 
personally known Palmer 
to 
campus. 
Baldwin 
shared several personal 
anecdotes 
with 
Leontis 
and 
helped 
shape 
the 
framing of the narrative of 
Leontis’s biography.
“This was not just a 
Greek story ... this is also 
a 
ladies’ 
Greek 
story,” 
Leontis said. “Those two 
pieces 
had 
never 
been 
brought 
together. 
The 
transnational movement, 
women who entered into 
classical studies sort of 
triangled and learned 
Greek 
and 
always 
presented 
themselves 
as amateurs, but had 
felt that their life was 
quite 
interconnected 
with 
their 
one 
in 
Greek.”
Leontis 
said 
her 
research allowed her 
to 
travel 
to 
several 
parts 
of 
Greece, 
including 
Delphi. 
In 
these archives, Leontis 
describes 
finding 
fascinating love letters 
between Palmer and 
her 
husband 
in 
an 
archive.
“Most 
interesting 
and challenging was an 
archive of love letters 
that were the center for 
Asia Minor studies in 
Greece,” Leontis said. 
“So just finding out the 
papers were there was 
an adventure.”
When asked about 
Leontis’s 
feelings 
about Palmer, she was 
hesitant 
at 
first 
to 

respond, as she purposely 
tried not to allow her 
personal feelings to reflect 
in her book.
“I worked very hard not 
to develop a relationship 
with the person, but it’s 
very hard to divorce her 
now,” 
Leontis 
said. 
“I 
think that she would be 
really 
quite 
unbearable 
sometimes. … I think I 
would 
really 
disagree 
with her fundamentally 
on almost everything … 
but I fell in love with her 
stuff.”
LSA sophomore Dana 
Papandreadis said it was 
interesting that Leontis 
started off wanting to 
document Palmer’s life 
but was able to delve 
into 
so 
many 
other 
disciplines.
“It’s really cool that 
she 
dove 
into 
… 
so 
many 
different 
angles,” 
Papandreadis said. “She 
just 
started 
writing 
a 
biography but it hit so many 
different categories.”
LSA senior Tim Bennett 
said the lecture exposed 
him 
to 
a 
completely 
different aspect of Greek 
culture.
“There’s 
a 
whole 
realm of Greek history 
that I just knew nothing 
about. That there were 
even 
these 
festivals, 
these Delphic festivals,” 
Bennett said. “That there 
were these people who 
were bringing aspects of 
American culture, Indian 
culture, to the costume 
design, 
choreography. 
There’s 
archives 
for 
choreography? 
That’s 
crazy.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
... Even just having things like Subways and 7-11’s right downtown 
seems kind of weird sometimes. I’m used to having a more localized feel 
to it, like when I was a kid… I wish it was the way it used to be. Ann 
Arbor definitely feels more pretentious than it used to be.”

Mitch Czechowicz, kitchen manager at the Detroit Street Filling Station

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, Business senior Sonia 
Lee wrote about University support for culturally-based fraternal 
organizations.

“This was my first time writing about Greek organizations. It’s 
interesting, I think that writing about Greek life, all of Greek life, they 
are a little bit more closed off sometimes, when it comes to talking 
about the Daily especially, and I don’t know if that’s why some people 
didn’t respond to me, but I definitely sense that some people wanted 
to be very careful about what they’re saying, which I get because it 
can be a bit of a hot topic at times. But I felt like at the same time, 
communicating with MGC and MPHC was easier than what it seems 
like what it seems like to be communicating with IFC and Panhel, and I 
think it’s just because they’ve had a lot more stories about them come 
out versus these organizations, and I think that’s how it is, basically.”

life?”
Common said much of his 
conviction to do good is also 
rooted in his spirituality. Pointing 
to his heart, he said he believes 
God gives everyone a purpose, a 
value he said keeps him grounded 
in all the decisions he makes. 
“I take my time to pray, I take 
my time to take it in,” Common 
said. “And if it don’t feel right 
for me right here, no matter 
what my manager says, what my 
agent says, what my mother says, 
knowing what my core purpose is 
and my function is, then I don’t do 
it. And I don’t let anything sway 
me away.”
Speaking on the role of business 
in his work, Common compared 
business to an “amplifier” which 
gives his music a platform to 
have widespread impact. He 
also encouraged the audience to 
maintain integrity and pursue 
their 
passions 
regardless 
of 
monetary temptations. 
“It’s nothing to profit and get so 
much money but lose your soul for 
that,” Common said. “No matter 
how much money you gain, if you 
lose yourself in it, that’s a recipe 
for unhappiness.”
DeRue then posed a question 
from a student to Common about 
how to navigate race relations 
in 
an 
increasingly 
divided 
United States. To much audience 
applause, 
Common 
said 
the 
country needs to first recognize 
the suffering of Black Americans. 
“America, white America, and 
especially the ones in government 
who hold a lot of the keys to what 
history, what the conversation 
is about, need to acknowledge 
the 
pain, 
enslavement, 
the 
dehumanizing of black people in 
America,” Common said. 

“It does feel to me like we 
sometimes make a mistake 
in government in saying or 
arguing that there is this 
wonderful solution to solve 
all of these problems,” Patrick 
said. “And when we consider 
a challenge as profound as 
climate change, we need to be 
doing a lot of different things 
simultaneously.” 
Innovation, 
Patrick 
emphasized, 
needs 
to 
be 
fostered in such a way where 
failure is not penalized but 
instead seen as a step toward 
an improved world. 
“I think there is also an 
appetite for innovation in 
government,” Patrick said. 
“But successful innovation, 
I think, requires that you 
raise 
your 
tolerance 
for 
failure. And politics punishes 
failure.” 
One key area Patrick said 
needs to be improved upon 
was 
resource 
efficiency 
and waste. He highlighted 
infrastructure as oftentimes 
being outdated and therefore 
severely inefficient for cities. 
“If 
you 
think 
about 
something 
like 
water 
for 
example, 
we 
have 
water 
pipes 
under 
the 
city 
of 
Boston — wooden ones — 
not all of them, but wooden 
water pipes in active use,” 
Patrick said. “The amount 
of waste that happens in 
that piping … When we talk 
about massive investment in 
infrastructure, what comes 
to mind is roads and bridges. 
And that’s important. But 
there 
is 
an 
underground 
infrastructure 
that 
needs 
massive restructuring.” 
On the topic of raising 
more 
awareness 
about 

climate 
change, 
Patrick 
emphasized 
the 
idea 
of 
continuous 
improvement 
within companies.
“We have to make the case 
that we have a better idea 
for how to fuel the kind of 
society we want to live in and 
frankly the expectations that 
we have,” he said. “Without 
having the only option be 
shaming the folks who — 
I’m not saying don’t use it, 
just not having it as the only 
option — shaming the folks 
who perpetuate what we 
have always done.”
Patrick now works at Bain 
Capital in impact investing 
where capital is invested in 
organizations 
addressing 
societal and environmental 
issues. Through this, he can 
help provide the capital for 
forward-thinking companies 
to innovate and build their 
ideas out. 
“We 
invest 
in 
lower 
middle-market 
companies, 
so these are positive cash 
flow companies where we 
can generate both a financial 
and 
a 
measurable 
social 
or environmental impact,” 
he said. “We chose three 
of what we call ‘thematic 
purposes’: 
sustainability, 
health and wellness, and 
education. … We invest in 
companies where executive 
teams are trying to take 
their companies from where 
they are to where they need 
to be.”
The end of the conversation 
focused 
on 
politics 
and 
activism, and how the two 
play a part in battling climate 
change. Though Patrick is 
glad to see younger people 
participating 
in 
activism, 
he also has doubts about 
how long they will continue 
advocating for people and 
purposes, he said.

“A whole lot of folks who 
haven’t been engaged a lot, 
a lot of them young, come 
out and show up — they’ve 
taken to the streets,” he said. 
“Now, I said at some risk at 
an earlier meeting … that a lot 
of those folks strike me as not 
having the longest attention 
span, or they’re caught up 
in the celebrity culture we 
have right now where you get 
a person elected, and once 
they’re elected you go back to 
what you were doing instead 
of organizing.” 
Following 
the 
event, 
Rackham student Rebecca 
Lowy said she agreed with 
Patrick’s push for innovation, 
emphasizing 
the 
issue 
of 
fossil fuels.
“I really liked his comment 
that the Stone Age didn’t 
end because they ran out of 
stones,” Lowy said. “That’s 
very relevant to what we’re 
facing right now with fossil 
fuels. 
We 
don’t 
need 
to 
deplete them to move on to 
something bigger and better 
and better for our future.”
Rackham student Shanea 
Condon said she came to 
the event because she was 
interested 
in 
hearing 
a 
political 
perspective 
on 
environmentalism. 
Condon 
agreed with Lowy, saying 
she 
appreciated 
Patrick’s 
perspective the government’s 
role in technology. 
“We need to have more 
patience and grace for failure, 
especially 
with 
planning 
for innovation and trying to 
understand how technology 
can improve,” Condon said. 
“How politics doesn’t really 
make space for that and how 
we need to have patience for 
each other. Not only with 
innovating, but also with 
getting people to jump on 
board with innovation.”

LSA freshman Nicholas 
Cemalovic was surrounded 
by Dylan’s music in his 
childhood.
“(My parents) would play 
it, and there’s this psych 
phenomenon where the more 
you’re exposed to a stimulus, 
the more you’re likely to enjoy 
it,” Cemalovic said. 
Aside 
from 
his 
music, 
students are also intrigued 
by Dylan’s background and 
influence in music culture. 
His music was not only used 
for entertainment but also 
for social change. According 

to Biography.com, in 1965, he 
introduced electronic music 
into his folk style, causing 
controversy 
in 
the 
music 
world. In 1989, Dylan was 
inducted into the Rock & Roll 
Hall of Fame.
LSA 
junior 
Vincenzo 
Convertino started listening to 
Bob Dylan in high school and 
will be attending the concert. 
Convertino 
is 
particularly 
interested in Dylan’s influence 
on other artists.
“He also wrote a lot of 
famous songs by other artists 
— I think that’s pretty cool 
about him,” Convertino said. 
Of the many songs he wrote, 
“All Along the Watchtower” 
has 
had 
a 
long 
history, 

including 
immense 
success 
from 
the 
Jimi 
Hendrix 
Experience version.
Cemalovic also expressed 
interest 
in 
Dylan’s 
music 
history and life. 
“You can pinpoint different 
things in American history,” 
Cemalovic said. “He was very 
anti-war and wrote a lot of 
music that centered around 
counter-culture.” 
Tickets for the concert went 
on sale on Sept. 20, including 
a select number of discounted 
student tickets, which sold 
out the same day they were 
released. However, full price 
tickets are still being sold 
through the Michigan Union 
Ticket Office.

“Our founding fathers, they 
were the first group of men 
to 
found 
an 
Asian-American 
fraternity because they wanted 
to join a traditional IFC fraternity 
but they weren’t allowed. This was 
back in 1929.” 
Like the Interfraternity Council 
and the National Panhellenic 
Conference, NPHC and MGC are 
supported primarily by the Office 
of Fraternity and Sorority Life. In 
addition to helping organizations 
with operations and events, FSL 
has been trying to help raise 
awareness 
about 
CBFOs 
on 
campus and within the Greek life 
community. 
“FSL staff works with the 
councils and chapters to affirm the 
cultural significance and unique 
histories of their fraternities and 
sororities, and support their inter/
national and campus initiatives,” 
FSL wrote in a statement to The 
Daily. “The staff also helps to 
provide context and education 
about CBFOs to other campus 
partners who may interact with 
NPHC and MGC chapters during 
any of their various campus events 
and projects. Additionally, FSL 
consults with national speakers 
and experts to work with NPHC 
and MGC on topics through 
the specific lens of culturally-
based 
fraternal 
organizations 
including 
recruiting 
and 
community-building strategies at 
predominantly white institutions, 
and risk management education.” 
LSA senior Chyanne Laldee, 
who is president of NPHC and a 
member of Sigma Gamma Rho 
Sorority Inc.’s Iota Psi chapter 
said the council is grateful for the 
support they have received from 
FSL. 
“They have been a constant 
support system to help voice 
concerns of our communities and 
provide the efficient amount of 
support to help our community 
as well,” Laldee wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily. “They 
have been a constant advocate for 
the NPHC and we wouldn’t have 
gained a lot of the things we have 
without them advocating for us in 
different ways.”
LSA 
senior 
Silan 
Fadlallah 
agreed, saying FSL offered a 
welcoming 
and 
encouraging 
support 
system 
during 
the 
founding of the Zeta chapter of 
sorority Epsilon Alpha Sigma, the 
first and only Arab sorority in the 
country, which started its chapter 
at the University in 2018.
“MGC does a great job of 
supporting us, and especially our 
advisor, Courtney, and the larger 
MGC community,” Fadlallah said. 
“I could not have asked for more, 
especially from the organizations 
themselves.”

According 
to 
some 
CBFO 
representatives, 
while 
support 
from FSL and fellow council 
members 
has 
been 
excellent 
and open-minded, support from 
the 
University’s 
administration 
has been lacking in areas like 
recognition. Additionally, CBFO 
representatives said they don’t 
have as much money as other Greek 
organizations.
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
clarified 
that 
no 
fraternal 
organizations 
receive 
funding from the University.
“No fraternities or sororities 
in any of the councils receive any 
U-M funding,’ Fitzgerald wrote 
in an email to The Daily. ‘The four 
councils all receive comprehensive 
advising and support from the U-M 
Office of Fraternity & Sorority 
Life.”
LSA junior Dipita Das, a member 
of the Beta chapter of Sigma 
Lambda Gamma, said that because 
MGC and NPHC organizations 
were founded more recently, they 
lack the donors and funds many 
IFC and Panhel organizations have. 
Often, she said, MGC organizations 
will run small fundraisers or apply 
for grants to put on cultural events. 
She said financial restrictions 
and the limitations on grant 
applications make it even more 
difficult to put on these events.
“The University claims, ‘Oh 
we’re so diverse,’” Das said. “Well, 
if you’re so diverse, why aren’t 
you allowing us to hold different 
events to express our cultures and 
identities? Why are there all these 
guidelines on how to be cultured?” 
One 
key 
issue 
CBFO 
representatives brought up was the 
publicity of their organizations. 
According to Soto, some students 
might not join CBFOs simply 
because they do not know of the 
organizations or that they are 
present at the University. 
“I would really love to see 
multicultural Greek life and the 
Divine Nine promoted more on 
campus. ... A lot of people don’t 
know we exist,” Soto said. “So, they 
end up either pushing off Greek 
life and not thinking about it, or 
joining Panhel and maybe realizing 
later that there are multicultural 
orgs and wishing they had known 
sooner. I think promotion is a big 
thing, because we do a lot of great 
things for the community, but with 
the smaller councils, not everyone 
gets to know about what we do.”
Engineering senior Cryserica 
Jeter said the Nu chapter of Delta 
Sigma Theta sorority, Inc., of which 
she is a member, also receives less 
recognition for their community 
work 
from 
the 
University 
administration 
than 
IFC 
and 
Panhel organizations do.
“If you asked the president if 
he knew about MGC and NPHC 
organizations, he probably doesn’’,” 
Jeter said. “But he probably knows 
a good amount of IFC and Panhel 

organizations, just because it takes 
an extra effort to get to know 
minority groups on campus and to 
actually figure out what they stand 
for. ... I don’t feel like other people 
that don’t identify as minorities 
are actually trying to do that, or 
trying to fight for us to get space 
on campus, or even remember us as 
leaders.” 
Within Greek life, collaboration 
between the four councils has 
not always been the norm, not 
only because of their differing 
sizes but also because NPHC and 
MGC serve different purposes 
as CBFOs. But with a larger push 
for diversity, equity and inclusion 
within Greek life, some MGC and 
NPHC leaders have been noticing 
improved efforts for collaboration 
and understanding between the 
four councils. In addition to all 
prospective Greek life members 
having to complete a training 
module 
about 
each 
council’s 
history, Jeter said IFC and Panhel 
organizations are often open to 
hearing NPHC’s own concerns.
“We have a lot of meetings as 
leaders with Panhel and IFC,” 
Jeter said. “So throughout those 
meetings we’re able to express 
our concerns, and they’re open to 
things that they probably didn’t 
even know about because they’re 
not a part of our communities. And 
within that we can collaborate 
more and invite them to more of 
our events so they can get to know 
more about what we’re struggling 
with, to help us in any way possible, 
and vice versa.” 
Soto, however, said it was 
sometimes difficult to bring up 
these concerns because of the 
difference in membership size in 
CBFO councils versus IFC and 
Panhel. 
“I know that our needs and 
our wants are very different from 
IFC and Panhel, and being much 
smaller — both of us are — it can 
be difficult to voice our concerns 
whenever we’re in spaces with all 
four councils, just because of the 
number of them when it comes 
to IFC and Panhel,” Soto said. “I 
know that we do things among the 
councils that are equal, but I don’t 
think they’re always equitable, 
because 
our 
needs 
are 
very 
different.” 
Das 
said 
similarly 
NPHC 
and 
MGC 
mainly 
collaborate 
with each other because of their 
shared 
experiences 
and 
their 
emphasis on multiculturalism. The 
organizations invite each other to 
their events and often share similar 
goals and values. 
“Just being people of color in 
both organizations, we have that 
bond, like, ‘Oh, I understand where 
you’re coming from, here is some 
support,’” Das said.

The major academic goals 
of the project, he said, are 
to improve the quality of 
on-campus teaching through 
the use of XR and integrate 
XR 
into 
online 
curricula. 
Additionally, Nelson said the 
initiative was created in hopes 
of prompting public-private 
partnerships with the goal of 
developing 
new 
XR-related 
technologies.
Nelson said he has been 
working 
with 
professors 
across disciplines to increase 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
through XR. As an example 
of this, he noted a School of 
Nursing course utilizing XR to 
give students the opportunity 
to 
experience 
high-risk 
hospital situations without the 
actual risk.
“I would love to see really 
interdisciplinary engagement, 
so students from Engineering, 
students from Art & Design and 
architecture and humanities,” 
Nelson said. “It really brings 
different skill sets to the table 
to either build new content 
or curate these experiences. 
Building upon that expertise 
is what Michigan is known 
for. It’s really cross-discipline 
and interdisciplinary research 
and learning, and taking that 
to the next level in the student 
experience.”
The interdisciplinary goals 
for the initiative span beyond 
STEM, Nelson said. While he 
noted XR is typically associated 
with the technological and 
scientific fields, he said he 
sees 
opportunities 
for 
all 
disciplines to benefit from XR.

Specifically, 
Nelson 
said 
an English professor could 
use this technology to create 
a scene from a novel to show 
how the characters experience 
empathy. He pointed to this 
collaboration 
as 
one-way 
humanities scholars have used 
XR to improve education.
Currently, 
a 
team 
of 
University professors led by 
the School of Information 
are working on creating a 
graduate 
certification 
for 
XR technology. Nelson said 
there will be a fellowship 
for both undergraduate and 
graduate students to work on 
projects involving XR at the 
University.
Since 2018, the student-led 
Alternative Reality Initiative 
has been exposing students 
to XR. Nelson lauded the 
ongoing 
commitment 
of 
students already involved with 
this technology and said the 
initiative is building off their 
work.
Business 
junior 
Michael 
Zhang, ARI president, said 
he is excited to see how XR 
technology will change how 
classes 
are 
taught. 
Zhang 
also serves as president of 
the Inter-Collegiate XR, a 
community 
of 
school 
XR 
student organization leaders 
in 
20 
North 
American 
universities.
“Traditionally, 
students 
learn using 2-D outlets like 
textbooks and worksheets,” 
Zhang said. “Now, with XR 
technology, 
we’ll 
be 
able 
to learn not only with 2-D 
elements but also with 3-D 
representations 
of 
material 
that we’re learning in 2-D.”
ARI Vice President Matthew 
Kosova, Engineering junior, 
said he hopes more people 

will use XR as the technology 
becomes more accessible in 
terms of ease of use and cost. 
“The 
technology 
has 
reached a point where prices 
are becoming better and the 
hardware is becoming easier 
to use,” Kosova said. “Now, 
it’s up to a diverse group of 
talented creators to design 
new applications, design new 
use cases for this technology, 
and that’s why XR technology 
essentially relies on the fact 
that there is a diverse pool of 
people using their respective 
backgrounds and interests to 
discover what are the future 
uses of XR technology.”
In the near future, Nelson 
said the initiative is planning 
an XR speaker series and 
hackathons 
to 
generate 
student interest. He said the 
new initiative supports the 
University’s role as a research 
institution 
as 
well 
as 
a 
commitment to enhancing the 
public good.
With the student work done 
in the past, Nelson said much 
of his work at the beginning 
stages of the initiative is 
to gauge the work that has 
already been completed on 
campus in the field of XR and 
looking for ways to bolster that 
work with the new resources 
from the initiative.
“I’’m spending this these 
early days understanding what 
work has already been done,” 
Nelson said. “Who are the 
people that are experimenting 
and experts in this space? 
What sort of resources do we 
have? What do we need? And 
helping pull that together and 
shine a light on all the great 
things already being done and 
how we take that to the next 
level as we go forward.”

In addition, Common shared he 
believes Black Americans should 
also strive to heal for themselves.
“We owe it to ourselves to not 
carry the weight of oppression,” 
Common said. “We owe it to 
ourselves to not carry the weight 
of that hatred … I’ve got to forgive, 
because if I carry this with me, 
I’m not going to be the best human 
being I can be.”
To 
close, 
Common 
urged 
students in the audience to pursue 
their dreams in ways that better 
other people.
“Love for God, love for self, and 
love for others as self — if we can 
apply that each and every day, we 
will all be bettering the world,” 
Common said. 

Norman Bishara, Business School 
associate dean for undergraduate 
programs, explained the school 
brought in Common as the speaker 
for the event as part of their focus on 
integrating the arts and humanities 
in business. 
“I think you can judge from the 
reactions of our students that they 
were engaged, that they learned a 
lot and also got a lot to think about,” 
Bishara said. “In classes, students 
are talking about the role of business 
in society, so it’s really important for 
students to appreciate how all these 
different things come together.”

Legalize mushrooms... and everything else

Reconciling feminism and multiculturalism

DIVYA GUMUDAVELLY | COLUMN

DESI DIKOVA | OP-ED

D

enver is famous for its 
drug culture. Whether 
it 
be 
the 
marijuana 
dispensaries lining almost every 
street or the microbreweries 
littering the city’s burgeoning 
“hip” (gentrified) neighborhoods, 
it’s certain that the Mile High 
City knows how to have a good 
time. This became obvious to me 
the summer before last after my 
mom and I moved there from 
Nebraska.
On our way to see a band named 
BoomBox, my mom, my friend 
Nadezhda and I stood together 
outside of the Ogden Theatre, a 
famous concert venue off of the 
infamous Colfax Avenue. The 
sun had just set, bringing this 
particularly 
raunchy 
section 
of Colfax to life. Various shady 
characters 
stumbled 
up 
and 
down the street, past groups of 
raucous, 
bar-hopping 
tourists 
staying at the Ramada down the 
street. Two political canvassers 
surfed the sea of buzzed, soon-to-
be concert-goers.
One 
person 
signed 
their 
petition, followed by another 
and then another. What political 
issue was so urgent to inspire this 
gaggle of inebriated adults?
One of the canvassers yelled 
out the answer.
 “Legalize mushrooms!”
“Yeah, right,” my friend and 
I snickered before walking into 
the concert hall and forgetting 
about the comedic situation. 
That was my first experience 
with 
Denver’s 
burgeoning 
“mushroom movement.” Until 
this May, that is, when Denver 
citizens 
narrowly 
passed 
a 
measure 
decriminalizing 
the 
use of hallucinogenic “magic” 
mushrooms. This significantly 
deprioritized 
the 
police’s 
enforcement of laws prohibiting 
their use. This shouldn’t have 
surprised me, given the almost 
constant smell of weed that 
hovers over the state of Colorado, 
where 
a 
thriving 
Deadhead 
culture has promoted the use of 
psychedelic drugs for over half a 
century — but it did. 
Being the child of a drug-
addict father and an ex-hippie 
mom, my experiences with drugs 
varied greatly depending on 
which parent was doing them. 
One of my earliest memories 
is my parents fighting in the 
driveway after my father decided 
to pawn our VHS player (along 
with 
almost 
everything 
else 
not nailed down) to sustain his 
lifelong drug addiction. The sour 
memories of ruined Christmases, 
crashed cars and a frequently 
disappearing dad didn’t sour my 
view towards drug use, though, 
with my mother and her band of 

hippie musician friends teaching 
me the importance of moderation 
and safe experimentation.
During my childhood, it wasn’t 
uncommon to see my mom and 
her friends crowd into our small 
kitchen for midnight “jam-out” 
sessions, no doubt with a few 
joints floating about the room, as 
the other kids and I played hide-
and-go-seek in the basement. As 
I grew up, I heard many of these 
friends describe their spiritual 
experiences 
with 
mushrooms 
and heard funny stories involving 
various other “hippie” drugs. 

My parents met in Leadville, 
Colo., — literally the highest 
incorporated 
city 
in 
the 
continental 
U.S. 
— 
during 
the peak of its hippie/grunge 
phase. My first piece of clothing 
was a tie-dye onesie, so I was 
born into the hippie life. But 
decriminalizing shrooms?! It just 
felt odd to me, letting people trip 
out on hallucinogenic fungi with 
the government’s tacit approval. 
What got me out of this very 
un-Coloradan attitude were the 
same people I had scoffed at with 
my friend outside the Ogden. 
Kevin Matthews, the man who 
organized 
the 
Decriminalize 
Denver campaign, said of their 
victory, “A lot of people who 
signed our petition said they are 
tired to see (sic) people going to 
jail over what they choose to put 
in their body.” I couldn’t argue 
with his rationale. It’s the same 
argument used by pro-choice 
and assisted-suicide advocates: 
The government shouldn’t have 
a say in what one does with their 
own body. It’s a radical idea in 
the U.S.,that an organization 
corrupted by centuries of greed 
and ignorance shouldn’t be able 
to imprison someone for eating 
a mushroom. In Portugal and 
Uruguay, however, this is the 
reality. 
These 
countries, 
for 
reasons ranging from cultural 
preservation to trying to stifle 
the deadly and failing drug wars 
that ravaged their countries, 
have decriminalized all drugs 
for personal use. Not only has it 
made these nations much cooler 
Spring Break spots, but it has also 

made most of them significantly 
safer, more economical and 
more humane. With our nation’s 
current prison occupancy at 
103.9 percent due to the epic 
failure of the war on drugs, it’s 
foolish to not entertain the idea 
of decriminalization. After all, it 
saved Portugal from a similarly 
unwinnable, 
American-style 
war on drugs that overloaded 
prisons, stigmatized seeking 
treatment and exacerbated the 
problem. 
In 
2001, 
after 
decades 
of 
failure, 
the 
Portuguese 
government 
desperately 
pulled a 180-degree turn and 
decriminalized 
all 
drugs 
for personal use, halting the 
costly and draconian policy of 
criminalizing drug users, and 
instead invested money toward 
taking care of the addicted. 
Eighteen years later, all of the 
nation’s drug-related issues have 
been greatly alleviated. 
This isn’t a guarantee the 
same would work here — nations 
are as unpredictable as the 
people that live in them — but 
other countries like Bolivia 
have followed suit, effectively 
fighting 
their 
nations’ 
drug 
problems through the humanity 
of decriminalization rather than 
the violence of criminalization. 
Mexico’s president even released 
a plan this May to follow 
Portugal’s lead and says he hopes 
the U.S. will eventually do the 
same.
Michigan and other states 
have already embraced this idea, 
albeit on a smaller scale, with the 
legalization of marijuana. With 
the federal government seemingly 
hell-bent on maintaining its 
failing strategy, the process of 
drug decriminalization would 
most likely follow weed’s lead, 
becoming a state issue before a 
federal one. 
While I am almost certain 
that Denver’s decriminalization 
of mushrooms was more about 
tripping out than avenging the 
people caught using them, they 
seem to have discovered the 
coveted and elusive solution 
to a problem that has ravaged 
our nation, and my family, for 
generations.
Decriminalization is by no 
means an endorsement of drugs. 
Rather, it’s an endorsement of 
allowing our government to 
treat its citizens, especially those 
who cannot stop using illegal 
substances 
without 
suffering 
through the terrible symptoms 
of withdrawal, with compassion 
rather than austerity.

T

he origins of Western 
feminist thought in the 
early 1900s were rooted 
in 
political 
and 
sociological 
theories of gender differences, 
a certain angst that came with 
the 
patriarchal 
institutions 
that dictated day-to-day lives. 
The movement that emerged 
from 
this 
struggle 
became 
intent on altering the prominent 
perspectives on where women 
stand in Western society. While 
the 
movement 
maintains 
its 
objective to advocate for equality 
on the grounds of gender identity, 
its members are often ignorant 
of the other intersections that 
characterize 
an 
individual, 
namely culture and ethnicity.
In 
the 
era 
of 
Western 
feminist imperialism, we must 
critically examine our discourse 
and actions and how they’ve 
created a new conflict between 
multiculturalism and feminism. 
Surely both can coexist. But 
do they? Historically, Western 
colonialism has systematically 
subdued 
people 
of 
color 
through 
action 
and 
intent. 
Currently, Western ideologies 
are 
establishing 
the 
notion 
of 
gendered 
orientalism, 
a 
misrepresentation 
of 
“other 
women” and their rights through 
incomplete 
dialogues 
and 
stereotyped viewpoints on a 
global, national and local scale. 
The central tenets of Western 
feminism typically, though not 
always, revolve around shared 
and accepted beliefs: a world 
without misogynistic violence, 
where pay parity is the norm 
and women have the freedom of 
choice. The context in which these 
are explored, however, needs 
to be one of cultural humility, 
which means understanding how 
certain cultural ideas compare 
and contrast with what people 
consider “expertise.”
As 
evolved 
from 
colonial 
thought, there is a ubiquitous, 
unacknowledged 
notion 
that 
Western philosophies present 
other cultures through a pitied, 
stereotypical 
viewpoint 
— 
which is also evidenced in the 
global feminist movement. For 
instance, the 2015 documentary 
“India’s Daughter,” directed by 
British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, 
offers a detailed and sobering 

account of the 2012 gang rape 
and murder incident of a young 
woman in India. While shedding 
light onto the cultural divide that 
galvanized a new movement in 
an image-conscious country, the 
film’s portrayal of the victim, Jyoti 
Singh, as a daughter propagates 
a rather dangerous notion as to 
who Indian women are and when 
their rights are worth fighting 
for. The film’s Western gaze 
constructs a narrow, almost two-
dimensional image of who Indian 
women are. Jyoti is reduced to a 
cultural stereotype — a virtuous, 
pure and hard-working student 
who needed protection. 
The film casts her as an abstract 
symbol exploited by those who 
knew and wronged her. Hence, 
she is reduced to these people’s 
thoughts of her, which is further 
muddled by the direction of a 
Western filmmaker. Her memory 
and existence in the history of 
the world are completely defined 
by one aspect of her identity — 
an Indian daughter — and her 
gruesome fate is misrepresented 
as a consequence of a culture that 
subjugates women. While these 
cultural tropes are not necessarily 
untrue, it is important to note that 
the crime was heinous because it 
was committed, not because it 
was committed against a pious 
Indian woman. 
Apart from globally reducing 
culturally-charged, 
feminist 
narratives to mere stereotypes, 
on a national level, Western 
feminism is ruptured in that 
advocacy is rooted in fulfilling 
Caucasian agendas that do not 
necessarily apply to minority 
populations. As Chandra Mohanty 
writes in her essay “Under the 
Western Eyes,” white feminism 
often 
overshadows 
without 
encompassing the complexities of 
colored experiences. A common 
topic of discussion, especially in 
today’s sociopolitical climate, is 
the income inequality that exists 
between men and women. The 
narrative that women make 82 
cents for every dollar that a man 
makes is incomplete and ignorant 
of broader systemic problems. Yet 
the full, racialized picture rarely 
receives as much attention as the 
fragmented one does. 
The startlingly large wage 
gap in the U.S. between women 

of color and white women is 
a discussion that is limited 
to political debate but little 
ground level recognition and 
action. The onset of new age 
feminism, dubbed the Fourth 
Wave of Feminism, carries the 
successes of the legacies created 
before it — voter equality, 
governmental 
representation, 
etc. — but compounds on the 
faults of the eras before it as 
well. It lacks intersectionality. 
Just like how women of color 
received the right to vote much 
later than white women, the 
war for equal pay seems to be 
serving only a portion of the 
population. The majority of 
the advocacy surrounding this 
issue is changing perceptions 
to lead to systemic changes. 
The perception becomes that 
women choose jobs that pay 
less, thus women deserve less 
pay when they choose to have 
children, hence women are not 
as professionally capable as men. 
Perceptions, 
however, 
are 
multilayered. The schema for 
a Black or brown woman is 
very different from the schema 
for a white woman, and so 
there must be room in the 
feminist movement for women 
of all intersecting identities to 
speak for and represent their 
experiences. 
The 
Western 
feminist framework must expand 
to value minority experiences as 
much as it values white ones and 
must find place in the collective 
consciousness of society and not 
just in political debates. 
On a local level, feminist 
discourse 
must 
translate 
to 
actions — ones that are inclusive, 
intersectional and champions 
of 
multiculturalism. 
Protests 
like 
the 
national 
Women’s 
March or even campus-wide 
ones 
must 
emphasize 
the 
experiences of both minority 
and white women, so that these 
experiences are woven into an 
overarching narrative rooted in 
multiculturalism. All women, 
regardless of whether they fit 
stereotypical Western images, 
deviate 
from 
Westernized 
agendas or otherwise, deserve 
representation and equal rights.

Considerations on clean energy
T

he apparent abundance 
and efficiency of fossil 
fuels revolutionized our 
energy systems. Research had yet 
to confirm environmental, health 
and economic risks, and even when 
it had, communication was poor. 
This lack of foresight has led us to 
the current, established system that 
resists change despite confirmed 
harm — sacrificial zones, energy 
poverty, ecological catastrophe, 
global warming and climate crisis. 
Fossil fuels catalyzed the Second 
Industrial 
Revolution 
at 
the 
expense of countless communities 
and regions around the world.
Unsurprisingly, 
it 
was 
the 
threat of scarcity rather than 
environmental and ethical issues 
that started pushing us away 
from fossil fuels. Research into 
alternative 
energy 
accelerated, 
with solar as one of the most 
attractive 
candidates 
due 
to 
abundant solar irradiance, though 
this can be limited as there are only 
so many hours in a day. Moreover, 
the process of fabricating a solar 
cell is incredibly material and 
energy intensive, and there are 
limited resources on Earth. What 
do we do once we’ve extracted it 
all? What do we do when we’re 
left with nonfunctional solar cells? 
Experts predict that we would 
generate 78 million metric tons of 
photovoltaic waste by 2050 under 
our current system. It is critical 
that we consider the full lifetime of 
a solar cell — from the harvesting 
of raw materials to methods of 
waste management. There are 
limited 
natural 
resources 
on 
Earth. Confronting this unsettling 
reality demands the development 
of more efficient and widely 
applicable methods to repurpose, 
remanufacture 
and 
recycle 
materials necessary to renewable 
energy sources. Namely, a circular 
economy of energy. 
The circular economy model 
first became popular in the 1970s 
and has since been championed by 
the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 
a UK-based charity that promotes 

and 
funds 
circular 
economy 
advancements. 
The 
current 
global economy runs in a linear 
fashion: production, use, waste. A 
linear economy depletes Earth’s 
raw 
resources 
and 
generates 
massive waste, a model that is no 
longer sustainable. In contrast, a 
circular economy keeps all raw 
materials within the economy 
through 
repair, 
refurbishment, 
remanufacture 
and 
recycling. 
Consider a cell phone in a circular 
economy: Repair would constitute 
customer care such as replacing 
the battery; refurbishment would 
require 
the 
manufacturer 
to 
replace parts like the screen or 
camera; 
remanufacture 
would 
take the phone apart to install 
new hardware; recycling would 
take the phone apart completely 
to extract individual materials, 
such as precious metals, wiring 
and plastics. Our current economy 
does not significantly include 
any of these pathways except 
recycling. 
But 
taking 
apart 
products completely is wasteful, 
needless and energy intensive. 
Furthermore, recycling in the U.S. 
is declining since exporting waste 
is no longer an option and no cost-
effective 
domestic 
alternatives 
exist. Radical action is needed to 
establish a true circular economy. 
It’s the only way to sustainably 
minimize waste.
These same principles must 
be applied to energy systems. 
Currently, 
silicon 
solar 
cells 
dominate 90 percent of the solar 
cell industry. Yet, while silicon is 
the second most abundant element 
on Earth, it remains a limited 
and problematic candidate for 
solar cell materials. Modern solar 
cell advancements rely on new 
materials with better electronic 
properties but potentially more 
hazardous materials. Perovskite 
solar cells, for example, have 
skyrocketed in efficiencies but 
often contain lead and other 
potentially hazardous materials. 
These 
hazardous 
materials 
demand 
multiple 
extractions, 

refinement 
and 
a 
lengthy 
period of transportation. These 
processes 
elevate 
the 
initial 
carbon footprint of producing 
solar cells. Furthermore, relying 
on trace materials has the 
potential to make us vulnerable 
to scarcity. Regardless of what 
material is used for our solar 
cells, circular economy principles 
will be key to designing a system 
that lasts.
Fossil fuels are an empire 
built on unethical, unsustainable 
practices that become impossible 
to correct as the empire grows. 
Thus, it is critical to investigate 
sourcing and waste management 
before committing to a new 
system. 
Our 
desperation 
to 
escape 
disastrous 
climate 
change by ditching fossil fuels 
has the potential to make us 
reckless 
and 
vulnerable. 
We 
must 
hold 
our 
industries, 
scientists, 
policymakers 
and 
energy companies accountable 
for 
answering 
the 
following 
questions: How are we mitigating 
exploitation, 
emissions 
and 
waste? Where will the energy 
be produced and maintained? 
How will it affect and support all 
communities? These are not trivial 
questions we can ignore while 
consuming seemingly limitless, 
cheap, consequence-free energy.
Solar 
irradiance 
may 
be 
infinite, but the raw materials 
needed to capture it are not. We 
cannot continue down a linear 
economy model, consuming raw 
materials and producing solar 
cell waste. There is no future 
in a linear economy. We must 
confront resource scarcity and 
waste generation by demanding a 
circular economy. Solar cells could 
make up a sustainable energy 
system, but they could also become 
the next fossil fuel disaster. No 
energy system under a linear 
economy can succeed.

It’s foolish to

This week, ABC’s “LOST” celebrated 
the 15th anniversary of its pilot. Originally 
pitched as a cross between “Survivor” and 
“Gilligan’s Island,” “LOST” at one time 
boasted the most expensive pilot in television 
history and was one of the first shows to 
capitalize on the burgeoning internet-
person desire to intensely dissect every last 
frame of every episode that ever aired. The 
show featured a diverse ensemble cast, and, 
through the use of its flashback structure, 
could go from a cop drama to a hospital soap 
opera to a sci-fi thriller episode to episode. 
It also took place on a mystical island with 
polar bears and smoke monsters and hatches 
buried underground. It was crazy and it 
was beautiful; there hasn’t been anything 
remotely like it since it ended.
When “LOST” originally came to a close 
in May of 2010, its end was met with an 
intense amount of scrutiny and criticism not 
unlike the ending of our current decade’s 
cultural juggernaut, “Game of Thrones.” 
Both shows captured the imaginations of 
million of people. Both had long-running 
serialized stories that relied on cliffhangers 
and shocking twists to keep the audience 
engaged. And while both ended in finales 
that are not always thought of highly, the 
endings themselves were criticized for very 
different reasons. “Game of Thrones” was 
critically savaged for turning its characters 
into cardboard cutouts of themselves and 
racing to an ending that didn’t feel earned. 
“LOST” ending-haters tended to focus more 
on the mysteries that were left unanswered 
and the decision by show runners Damon 

Lindelof and Carlton Cuse to focus their 
ending almost exclusively on the character 
arcs at the expense of the sprawling 
mythology they had created.
A lot of a show’s legacy is tied up in its end. 
Over the past nine or so years since “LOST” 
ended, whenever the show is brought up 
its ending is almost always brought up as 
well. They say that time heals all wounds, 
and that is certainly the case in terms of 
the “LOST” finale. As the years have gone 
on, the decision to focus the ending on the 
characters instead of the plot has proven 
prescient. As peak TV has become more 
and more character focused in the decade 
since “LOST,” audiences have come to 
expect satisfying endings to character’s 
journeys. The wrap-ups of “Breaking Bad” 
and “Avengers: Endgame,” widely regarded 
as solid for their respective stories, both 
choose to focus their ending around their 
central characters.
The ending of “Game of Thrones” was torn 
apart by fans, critics and audiences alike. It 
was compared to the ending of “LOST” and 
this comparison was used as a sign of scorn. 
But time has been kind to “LOST”s finale, 
and it’s possible that time will be kind to 
“Game of Thrones” as well. As people forget 
the immediate pain and disappointment of 
a favorite series coming to an end, the good 
memories that they have of the show begin to 
take precedence in their mind. Humanity as a 
species tends to look more fondly on the past 
as a way to justify the present. Everything 
looks better when you’re comparing it to 
what’s going on now. The ending of “LOST” 
looks great in comparison to the ending of 
“Game of Thrones,” and the ending of “Game 
of Thrones” could look great compared to 
the ending of whatever the next big thing is.

MUSIC REVIEW

Former member and heart and soul of Blink-
182 Tom DeLonge is often found at the buttend of 
jokes. How could he not be, though? He originally 
left the band so he could attempt to “change the 
world” with his influence and his various business 
ventures. Now, he claims to be the military’s chosen 
vessel to share information regarding UFOs and is 
the executive producer and star of a mini-series on 
the subject. On the outside, DeLonge appears to be 
completely delusional.
The same goes for the rest of Blink-182. Mark 
Hoppus, Travis Barker and newest member Matt 
Skiba are all in their mid-to-upper 40s, and they’re 
still singing about the same shit. Blink used to be 
all about youth culture, toilet humor, the endless 
pursuit of girls and the struggles that go along 
with it, and unfortunately, that’s still the band’s 
main focus on their ninth album, the cleverly titled 
NINE. Just look at a recent promotional video 
starring Travis Barker and pornstar Riley Reid as 
she attempts to recreate the near-iconic “What’s 
My Age Again?” video. The band feels they have 
an image to maintain, and on NINE, they’re trying 
their very best to maintain it.
Lead single “Blame It on My Youth” tells listeners 
everything they need to know about NINE. On the 
song, Hoppus and Skiba explain a little bit about 
their upbringings, with Hoppus stating that he 
“started off with plenty of nothing at all” and Skiba 
belts on the chorus, “You could never kill my high 
/ I’m the ink and you’re the headline / Blame it, 
blame it on my youth / Blame it, blame it on my 
youth / You could never block my shine.” It bears 
repeating that these men are in their 40s and, 
somehow, they still feel the need to justify how 
they became the men that they are.
The rest of the album follows a similar trajectory. 
The songs are largely uninspired, riffing on the 
usual tropes, and there isn’t much musical range 
between them. The one song that deviates from 
the norm is “Generational Divide,” a fast-paced 
barnburner, especially when stacked up against 
the rest of the album. It is a quick rumination 
on the cultural division between generations, 

specifically between Hoppus and his son. It feels a 
bit like a return to form that was stopped short for 
some reason. This glance backwards is especially 
depressing as the album moves forward.
For some reason, Blink’s members decided 
it would be a good idea to start playing with 
elements of electronic music and vocal processing 
techniques like autotune. The biggest offender of 
this crime is “Ransom.” It starts off questionably 
with some glittering keys, and then turns to shit 
as soon Hoppus’s autotune drench voice comes in. 
It’s sprinkled in sporadically throughout the song, 
and it’s wince-inducing every time. The song soon 
bursts into typical Blink fare, but by that point, the 
damage has already been done.
On NINE, the members are beyond disillusioned 
with themselves. They seem to think that they’re 
still the tastemakers of the pop-punk world. But 
alas, they are not. They are grown men who are 
still bitter about the women that spurned them 
(see “Hungover You” for further elaboration). Had 
the band taken a darker turn and explored the 
downfalls of their lives, perhaps NINE would have 

been more interesting. Instead, the album feels 
repetitive and out of touch, with no new ground 
broken.
On the other hand, things are beginning to 
look up for Tom DeLonge. His show Unidentified: 
Inside America’s UFO Investigation has been well 
received by viewers. What is even more notable, 
however, is the US Navy’s verification that videos 
released by DeLonge on his television show are 
indeed real. This, honestly, is a very big deal 
for him. It legitimizes his previous claims and 
validates DeLonge’s research group, To the Stars 
Academy of Arts and Sciences, as the leaders of the 
field of UFO identification and research. 
Who’s the delusional one now?

Blink’s ‘NINE’ is just shitty

There’s this moment, about halfway through 
“Hustlers,” when Ramona (Jennifer Lopez, “Second 
Act”) is taking a photo of her young mentee Annabelle 
(Lili Reinhart, “Riverdale”) to lure a Wall Street guy to 
meet them. “Turn around baby,” she tells Annabelle. 
“You know what he wants.” Annabelle turns around, 
looks over her shoulder, and touches her index finger 
to her lip, smiling coyly. Ramona snaps the picture and 
within seconds, the guy asks her when and where she 
wants to meet. 

It’s not a particularly important moment in the grand 
scheme of the movie, but it’s emblematic of a sense in 
“Hustlers” that women are experts of their own bodies. 
They know exactly how to calibrate the shape of their 
hips and the curves of their smiles to get what they want. 
They understand intimately the currency their bodies 
provide, and exactly how volatile that value exchange 
can be. “Hustlers” is a complicated story that navigates 
friendship, stripping, the financial crisis of 2008, sex 
and power. But if there’s a central conceit at the heart 
of the film, it’s about how women navigate that tricky, 
constantly moving target that is the intersection between 
their bodies and the profit they can extract from them. 
It’s a singularly American story, about how women 
shoved to the margins of society claw and fight their 

way to make it in a world that sees them as disposable. It 
would be a disservice to the complexity of the film to call 
it “empowering,” but it gives a voice to a group of women 
who are usually denied space or agency in Hollywood. 
Their story is remarkable.
Based on the real life exploits of a group of ex-strippers, 
“Hustlers” is centered on the perspective of young 
stripper Destiny (Constance Wu, “Crazy Rich Asians”), 
who joins with seasoned veteran Ramona to build a crew 
of fellow strippers who steal money from the high-roller 
finance guys who frequent their club. Ramona is a force of 
nature — charismatic and brilliant, sexy and sharp as all 
hell — and Destiny is entranced by her from the moment 
she lays eyes on her, working the pole to Fiona Apple’s 
“Criminal” as the stage under Ramona’s feet becomes 
awash with bills. 
Ramona wraps Destiny in her lush fur coat and takes 
her under her wing. She teaches Destiny how to give a 
proper lap dance, how to hoist herself up the pole, how 
to spot the men who will pay well. Mostly, she shows 
Destiny how to make real money in the exploitative 
system of New York City strip clubs, where the girls 
are the draw but all the profit ends up in the pockets of 
scummy managers who take 40% cuts of all the dancers’ 
earnings. Ramona has a daughter to take care of, Destiny 
has a grandmother. They bond over the ferocity of their 
protectiveness over their dependents and over their need 
to be self-sufficient. Destiny starts making good money 
under Ramona’s tutelage, and she finds community 
among her fellow dancers who have a warm, familial 
banter in the club’s dressing room. 
Then Destiny gets pregnant, and she leaves the club. 
A couple years pass, and suddenly it’s 2008. The market 
has crashed, her baby’s father leaves her, and Destiny 
starts dancing again. Except now the rules have changed, 
the clubs are empty of clients and the warmth among 
the dancers is gone. Ramona and Destiny have to start 
getting creative. 
“The game is rigged,” Ramona says. “And it does not 
reward people who play by the rules.” So they recruit a 
couple of other girls, Annabelle (Reinhart) and Mercedes 
(Keke Palmer, “Pimp”), to help them “go fishing,” or find 
rich men at high end New York bars to lure back to the 
strip clubs. Once they get them to the clubs, they get 
the men as intoxicated as possible, and start racking up 
the credit card charges. Destiny becomes the CFO to 
Ramona’s CEO, or the Kobe to her Shaq, as the women 
themselves put it in the film. It doesn’t take long for them 
to up the stakes. They concoct a new drug cocktail to 
slip into the men’s drinks to make them more malleable 

and willing to give up their cards. They graduate from 
taking $5,000 a night from one of their marks to $50,000. 
Together, they’re absolutely ruthless in the influence they 
exert over the other girls in their crew, and over the men 
they steal from. It’s modeled off of classic mob cinema, 
but this mob is a matriarchy, specifically run by and for 

women of color. Like any pair of good mob bosses, Destiny 
and Ramona’s relationship builds to a Shakespearean 
intensity in a swirl of designer clothes, money, blood and 
sweat. The highs are intoxicating. The lows will gut you. 
It’s difficult to overstate how deeply excellent this story 
is. Watching it feels like a zap of electricity, like you’re 
made privy to the very best of what entertainment can do. 
Granted, it would be very difficult to make a bad, or at the 
very least non-entertaining movie based off of a story this 
intrinsically strong. But everybody involved in “Hustlers” 
knocks it out of the fucking park, and every aspect of 
production is as brilliant and careful as it possibly could 
be — from the pitch perfect casting, to the rhinestoned 
costumes, to the legitimately transcendent soundtrack. 

Make no mistake, this movie is a masterpiece. There isn’t 
a wasted second or a dramatic beat that’s not earned. 
“Hustlers” is already a huge commercial success, 
which is unsurprising given how much unadulterated 
fun it is to watch, with all its delicious sleaze and 
sparkle, punctuated by a slew of sexy dances and 
shopping montages set to early 2000s pop and rap. This 
accessibility as a piece of pop art is crucial to the film’s 
urgent, glittery genius. The legibility, the sleaze, the sheer 
joy of watching “Hustlers” allows it to act like a Trojan 
horse for one of the sharpest commentaries on the post-
recession economy to ever hit the theaters. 
In that way, “Hustlers” is a lot like the women 
themselves, hiding their incisive intellect and business 
acumen under layers of fake lashes and contoured 
cleavage. But then, maybe they prefer it that way. Maybe 
it’s in their best interest to be underestimated, because 
after all, these are powerful men they’re targeting. 
Executives. Hedge fund managers. The high rollers at the 
tops of skyscrapers directly responsible for the poverty 
and desperation of the people below. But it doesn’t 
matter how weighty his gold watch is, or how diverse his 
stock portfolio. Each man they choose is utterly leveled, 
not only by the women’s bodies, or the sprinkled drug 
cocktail, but by the precision with which they expertly 
construct a fantasy that reduces him to a lolling, drooling 
mess at their feet. They’re too smart, too hot, too good at 
what they do — experts in the politics of money and the 
body. He never stood a chance.

Few collegiate orchestras have the dexterity 
to maintain a stylistically disparate repertoire. 
And fewer still are capable of performing 
Beethoven symphonies alongside lesser-known 
mid-20th-century American orchestral works.
But the University Philharmonia Orchestra 
proved they were capable of this and much more 
at their year-opening concert this past Monday 
night at Hill Auditorium. This was the University 
Philharmonia Orchestra’s first concert since 
the departure of former conductor Oriel 
Sans. Adrian Slywotzky, the ensemble’s new 
conductor, proved that he is more than capable 
of continuing the adventurous programming and 
occasional classic repertoire of Sans’s tenure.
The 
concert 
began 
with 
Beethoven’s 
“Symphony No. 2 in D Major,” a turbulent piece 
that repeatedly fluctuates between simple, 
light material and loud, dark, complex material. 
The orchestra handled these shifts in the 
first movement with great dexterity, building 
towards a clear peak before falling back down. 
The lower string sound, in particular, blew me 
away in this movement.
Unfortunately, as with many performances 
of this work, the orchestra struggled slightly at 
the beginning of movement two — the energy of 
the first movement gives way to a slow, lyrical 
second movement, and many orchestras struggle 
to give this movement equal emotional weight. 
By the middle of the movement, however, the 
orchestra seemed to have found their stride 
again. I was particularly impressed with the 
length of the crescendi and decresendi that the 
orchestra was able to maintain, as they stretched 
these musical events over ten to twenty seconds 
worth of music.
While the orchestra had a few problems 
maintaining their blistering tempo at the 
beginning of the third movement, they recovered 
after a couple of measures and stuck together 
throughout the remainder of the movement. By 
its end, they had found their stride and were well 
within their element.
The fourth movement was thus a tour-
de-force 
in 
early-Beethovenian 
orchestral 
performance, as short motivic figures jumped 
around the orchestra and tension built before 
a final loud thematic recapitulation. Slywotzky 
decided to begin this movement with minimal 
pause, and I, for one, was taken aback by the 
confident, strident texture — and the movement 
only built from there. Melodic fragments jumped 
from bassoon to violin, for example, while the 
underlying accompanimental figures continued 
unrelentingly.
By the end of the piece, I was exhausted for 
the orchestra. They had made a valiant effort in 
tackling this staple of the repertoire, and though 
it wasn’t perfect, I couldn’t have been more 
impressed with their attempt. 
After a brief intermission, the concert 
continued with two works by lesser-known mid-
20th-century American composers, William 
Grant Still and Walter Piston. The first piece, 
Still’s “Poem,” was an interesting juxtaposition 
of jazz harmonies and orchestral compositional 
techniques. The fast writing in the beginning, 
for example, was not particularly memorable to 
my ears. Though there were some interesting 

surface-level ideas, the basic musical content 
never 
evolved 
past 
repetition 
and 
slight 
transformation.
The second half of the piece, however, 
consisted of a simple yet beautiful melody 
accompanied 
by 
slowly-evolving 
orchestral 
chords. It made the whole piece, if not the whole 
concert, worth it, and even as I sit and try to 
write this review a day later, I can’t quite get it 
out of my head.
The last piece on the program, Piston’s “The 
Incredible Flutist Suite,” was an interesting 
coalescence of various musical styles and genres: 

a “siesta,” a minuet, a waltz, a march and a polka. 
It was a fun, light ending to the program, a good 
balance to the complexity of the Beethoven and 
the simple beauty of the Still.
One aspect of the Piston that caught me 
off guard was the “Circus March,” in which 
members of the orchestra screamed as though 
they were attending a circus while the brass and 
percussion sections played traditional circus-
esque music. “The Flutist” was also impressive, 
the flute soloist’s impressive concerto-like 
playing easily earning the “Incredible Flutist” 
portion of the title.
The large orchestral forces at work in this 
piece stood in stark contrast to the smaller ranks 
of the other two pieces. (This was the only piece 
on the program that included a piano part, and 
I was quite impressed with the pianist’s ability 
to blend with the sound of the larger). My one 
complaint, if any, was that Piston’s orchestrations 
tended towards the percussion heavy ends of 
the orchestral spectrum, particularly in his use 
of bass drum and snare. But after two lighter 
pieces, this was an interesting change in flavor.
If this concert was a sign of what’s to come for 
the University Philharmonia Orchestra under 
Adrian Slywotzky this coming year, I can’t 
help but be excited. While doubts frequently 
accompany changes in faculty such as this one, 
it is obvious that the orchestra remains in good 
hands.

Statement 

Lucy 
Ellmann’s 
seventh 
novel 
“Ducks, 
Newburyport” was rejected by Bloomsbury, 
which published the previous six. It’s not hard to 
see why: the novel is nearly a thousand pages, and 
most of that length is taken up by one continuous 
sentence narrating the internal monologue of a 
Midwestern American homemaker, something 
like the “Penelope” section in “Ulysses” extended 
to the length of the whole book. The sentence’s 
units of construction are lists of alliterative 
or conceptually related words (“bento box, 
incense sticks, joss sticks, josser, equestrian acts, 
Patricia Highsmith,”) and statements, questions 
and speculations prefaced with the plaintive, 
grammatically-questionable phrase “the fact that.” 
It’s a texture that lends itself to a rumination/
free-association/referential chaos narrative made 
entirely of loose ends. 
The novel has gotten a lot of critical attention 
since its release. Justifiably so — it’s a wildly 
ambitious and totally unique masterpiece of 
the kind that doesn’t frequently appear in 
contemporary fiction. This also means the novel 
stands out in the current literary landscape like 
an octopus on a sidewalk, a standing challenge to a 
literary culture that tends to produce quiet novels 
in the 19th-century mold. Formal experimentation 
suddenly seems like the appropriate way to depict 
a character who might just be a passing presence 
in another novel — Ellmann doesn’t highlight 
a marginalized voice, she makes that voice the 
general case, makes it stand in for the anxiety of 
the moment. I’m reminded of Amitav Ghosh’s 
argument in “The Great Derangement” about 
literature ignoring climate change and societal 
catastrophe. Ellmann doesn’t just bring these 
themes to the forefront, she makes them scream. 
The book’s standing rebuke also makes the 
conventional book review look a little ridiculous. 
The general structure that reviews of “Ducks” tend 
to are comments on the length, calling it immersive 
or dazzling or important or worth it, or saying 
something about consciousness or subjectivity. 
Book reviews can at times resemble publisher’s 
lists: they never really do the work justice, they 
tell you what you already know about the book, 
they are vapid and sterile and hardly useful. This 
laughable piece on “Ducks” in the Chicago Tribune 
that is mostly a yuppie-scented meditation on not 
reading long books (“It’s not that I’m quick to give 
up if a book doesn’t immediately invite me in, but 
I find that I’m less eager to test my mettle.”) is just 
the worst example of a genre that is defined, in 
part, by its cursoriness. This is true for any even 
remotely complex work of fiction, but it’s doubly 
true for anything ambitious or unconventional. 
For my part, I’m not really interested in writing 
another “review.” I’m responding to Ellmann’s 
provocation with a list of my own — of ways into 
the book, ways that one could try to get around this 
unusual work of immense force. 

Stream 

Ellmann’s father is a notable Joyce scholar, 
something she seems to have distanced herself 
from. In an interview with the Washington Post, 
she says she “tuned out” all the Joyce talk her father 

would bring home “when my mother didn’t put her 
foot down.” One thing that sets “Ducks” apart from 
Joyce is all the commas. “Penelope” uses very little 
punctuation and seems to rely on a consistent sense 
of grammatical ambiguity that gives the thoughts 
a flickering quality. “Ducks” moves the unit of the 
stream from the clause or phrase to the thought or 
statement, thoughts that are usually fairly bounded. 
Ellmann’s protagonist even stops to correct herself 
when she creates ambiguity — a frequent move is 
to make a statement where a pronoun could refer to 
more than one person, whereafter the protagonist 
stops to clarify. 
There’s a turbulent quality to the book, a sense 

that the protagonist never stops trying to grasp 
hold of something solid. The constant references 
to books, films and other fragments of culture are 
footholds of sorts, the smallest unit of meaning in 
a world saturated with objects. The book’s stream 
of consciousness, then, is less of an unbroken flow 
of thought and more a kind of thought that gets 
caught up in everything, like a river flowing over 
rocks. 

Cognition 

More than one review has mentioned that 
“Ducks”’s aim is to create a more visceral, 
immediate representation of thought. It does do 
this very well. After reading the novel for a while, 
I noticed that I would emerge from an hour or 
two of it suddenly dazed at my surroundings. 
The narrator’s thoughts tend to take over those 
of the reader. Ellmann has reproduced the messy 
details of a wandering mind with surprising 
verisimilitude. Thoughts recur with no specific 
reason to, earworms float in and out of the frame, 
anecdotes get unpredictably broken down and used 
as jumping-off points for new ideas and threads. 
“Ducks” reminds me that the mind is a prismatic, 
unpredictable space.
However, it’s probably more accurate to say that 
Ellmann has less reproduced thought than created 
something that takes the outline of thought as a 
literary model. 

Ten ways of looking at 
‘Ducks, Newburyport’

EMILY YANG
Daily Arts Writer

In the new age of mixed media, sometimes it’s hard to tell if there are any 
boundaries between platforms. Will Smith is on YouTube, you can watch 
YouTube on television and now YouTuber Lilly Singh (IISuperwomanII) 
has taken over “Last Call with Carson Daly” with a late-night talk show of 
her own, “A Little Late with Lilly Singh.” As the first bisexual woman of 
color on lineup to host late-night television, Singh comes in with fervent 
energy and a new perspective. The transition from YouTube skits to late-
night TV is slightly awkward, but it’s a start nonetheless, and with a bit 
more time to hit her stride, Singh can rise through the ranks and easily 
find her niche in the late-night space.
The pilot starts off with a musical skit that reflects her peak YouTube 
days, and she doesn’t hesitate to call out the lack of diversity in Hollywood 
production and late-night television. The skit transitions to a rap dedicated 
to her workplace’s diversity and inclusivity standards, which can’t help but 
make political commentary on the nation’s current state. Whether this 
move brought in or expelled viewers is hard to tell, but her words were 
intentional and it likely had exactly the effect she intended. 
She first brings on Rainn Wilson (“Mom”) in a forced but clever bit 
about white noise machines, wherein the machine would make noises of 
white girls at brunch and the sound of Birkenstocks when they step. It’s 
a refreshing introduction to a late-night show that doesn’t consist of a 

rundown of the stupidest Trump tweets that week (although he does give 
comedy a lot of material to work with), and with Singh’s energy and sketch 
comedy background, there’s potential to get into some good material in the 
future. The scripted “surprise” guests are a classic and familiar device in 
late-night television, but on this particular episode it feels less surprising 

and more trying on the audience’s humor. But again, it’s a pilot and there’s 
plenty of time to improve. 
Her one and only interviewed guest was Wilson’s “The Office” co-star, 
Mindy Kaling (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”). Singh began with 
recognizing and thanking Kaling for paving the way for minorities like 
her, something that other late-night hosts don’t have the prerogative to 
talk about. It made the environment feel more natural, and Singh could 
smoothly transition from making jokes to making sure all necessary 
questions were answered. She can easily maintain this tone in her future 
interviews without it going sour. She might have been able to interview 
Kaling for a little longer, but she instead jumped right into two minigames. 
One was a “Euphoria” makeup inspired game, and the other an Urban 
Dictionary-type game where Kaling guesses the meaning of modern slang 
terms. They’re entertaining enough, but given the half-hour time slot NBC 
gave her, it felt rushed.
There’s little else to say. It’s irrational to be harsh toward a pilot of a 
late-night talk show, a flexible platform that can spin and adapt in any 
direction. It’ll be interesting to see how much Singh can improve from 
here on out, and especially interesting to see her fresh perspective given 
the current political and social climate. For now though, she’s definitely 
made an impression as a new host in this space and will likely continue to 
do so as the season goes on.

a simple yet beautiful

‘Everybody’s questioning us? We’ve just got to prove it’

For the Michigan defense, this 
weekend’s game will likely offer 
little in the way of conclusive 
answers.
Rutgers 
comes 
into 
this 
weekend’s bout in Ann Arbor ranked 
107th in the nation in total offense 
(one spot shy of Tennessee). It hasn’t 
finished better than 127th of 130 
teams in a full season since 2015-
16. Starting quarterback McLane 
Carter is out for Saturday’s game 
with a concussion, and the backup, 
Artur Sitkowski, threw for just 40 
yards and registered a negative 
adjusted passing yards per attempt, 
according to Sports Reference, in 
last year’s 42-7 loss to Michigan.
All of this is to say, this weekend 
likely won’t be a banner one for the 
Scarlet Knights. Conversely, this 
is far from the game to provide a 
litmus test for a defense suddenly 
on thin ice. That doesn’t leave this 
game devoid of meaning on the 
defensive end.
Last 
week, 
the 
Wolverines 

allowed 359 rushing yards in a 
revealing loss at Wisconsin. They 
have spent this week, as would 
be expected, touting a desire to 
improve and the will to do so.
Players and coaches admonished 
their effort from a week ago and 
noted a revamped energy in practice. 

Buzzwords like “physicality” and 
“execution” flew around the building 
like popcorn in a microwave.
“We didn’t play physical enough,” 
said Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
on Monday. “We were out-hustled. 
I take responsibility for that. In any 
ways that we were out-schemed, I 

take responsibility for that. It’s my 
job to make sure we are completely 
sound, in all offenses and defenses 
that we’re running.” 
Added senior linebacker Josh 
Uche: “You’ve got to respond to 
adversity. Everybody has a plan 
until they get punched in the mouth. 
Mike Tyson said, ‘You got punched 
in the mouth, what are you going 
to do about it?’ Am I going to lay 
down? Hell no. I’m going to get up, 
I’m going to keep fighting, keep 
swinging. That’s what this team is 
going to do.”
Swing, it presumably will, at a 
particularly feeble target Saturday. 
Though 
players 
would 
never 
entertain the idea, Rutgers might 
just be the ideal opponent coming 
off such a comprehensive drubbing. 
As such, the nature of the 
loss seemingly required a full-
scale breakdown — an effort to 
re-establish the fundamentals and 
start anew.
“There’s not a doubt in my 
mind that we can’t get that back,” 
said senior defensive end Michael 
Danna on Tuesday. “So we’ve got 
high expectations no matter what 
the outcome was last Saturday or 
whatever. Like I said, we still have 
high expectations. We still have a lot 
of hope.
“We were all surprised. We didn’t 
want to have that outcome. It is what 
it is now. That was four days ago, so 
we’ll move past it. It’s a new week, 
it’s a new challenge ahead.”
The 
questions 
this 
week 
— 
and 
subsequent 
answers 
— 
understandably 
focused 
on 
schematic 
and 
personal 
improvement. How does this get 

better? This is a unit that frequently 
touts its desire to be the best in the 
nation. It’s not an unsubstantiated 
expectation; 
all 
of 
Michigan’s 
defenses in the Don Brown era have 
finished top-3 in total defense, with 
the 2016 squad finishing No. 1 in the 
nation. 
That’s the standard at Michigan 
these days, and rightfully so. 
Last week’s performance, though, 
surfaced 
real 
questions 
about 
whether this roster’s personnel can 
live up to its internal expectations.
It wasn’t simply the result that 
raised alarm bells, but how it came 
to be. Wisconsin was unambiguous 
about its intention to run the ball 
down the defense’s throat. Then it 
went out and did so. The Badgers’ 
offensive line had its way with 
Michigan’s front. 
The result was a performance 
Harbaugh described succinctly: “It 
was thorough.”
The players, many of whom have 
been part of nationally elite defenses 
in their Wolverines careers, would 
scoff at any such notions of decline. 
They believe they have the group in 
place to reach a different level. And 
they don’t have much interest in 
entertaining the alternative.
“A lot of people outside of the 
program have a lot to say, but we’re 
worried about what’s going on inside 
the program,” Danna said. “We’re 
all family here, we’re a brotherhood 
here. We don’t condone none of the 
outside opinions, we stick together 
no matter what everybody has to 
say.”
There 
is 
caution 
against 
overreacting to any one result, no 
matter how revealing. This week 
will likely alleviate some existential 
concerns, though far from all. 
The defense can only prove so 
much about their aptitude for big 
games against a decidedly sub-
par opponent in Week 4 — that is, 
obviously, assuming the Wolverines 
win.
For now, the defense, and the 
team writ large, is treating Saturday 
as a stepping stone. Eventually it 
could reach a desired end. But not 
without taking that first step.
“I think we’re a physical, hard-
nosed defense,” Danna said. “There’s 
no doubt in my mind about that. I 
spent all camp being here, seeing it. 
There’s no doubt in my mind we’re 
a hard-nosed defense. We’ve just got 
to put in on tape now. 
“Everybody’s 
questioning 
us? 
We’ve just got to prove it.”

After two uneasy wins to start the year, Michigan traveled to 
Wisconsin and was dished a dose of reality last week, falling 35-14. 
This week, the tenor has been both downtrodden and eager. Saturday, 
the Wolverines step back on the field for the first time, set to take 
on Rutgers after last week’s drubbing required a season-wide 
recalibration. The spotlight will be on the offense suddenly dealing 
with an identity crisis, and a defense with a growing number of 
skeptics.

The Daily breaks down what to watch for, 
in what should be a comfortable win.

Middle Tennessee State (Aug. 31): Look man, 
the middle of Tennessee is decidedly not a state.

Army (Sept. 7): The Army football team: The 
only time running behind enemy lines is a good 
idea.

Penn State (Oct. 19): Hey, Mike.

Notre Dame (Oct. 26): You think beating Mich-
igan is special? Everyone’s doing it these days!

Maryland (Nov. 2): Maryland has crabs.
Wisconsin (Sept. 21): Sure, your town is sick 
and your beer is elite and your football team is 
dominant, but do you have a sculpture that says 
“Art” from every angle?

Michigan State (Nov. 16): The Michigan Daily 
has beaten The State News 14 years in a row.
Rutgers (Sept. 28): My grandma’s New Jersey 
retirement home mahjong group could beat Rut-
gers in football ... basketball would be close, too.

Iowa (Oct. 5): The year is 2080. Aliens have 
taken over. Iowa capped off a 7-5 season with a 
five-year extension for Kirk Ferentz. All is well.

Illinois (Oct. 12): Someone go over there and 
make sure Lovie Smith still has a pulse.

Ohio State (Nov. 30): Do you think Justin 
Fields can play the game online, too?

Indiana (Nov. 23): Hoosier favorite to be the 
next head coach of this supremely mediocre 
program?

Ten months later, Kelly Ber-

toni still remembers the con-
versation.

The drum major for the 

Michigan marching band stood 
at the doors of Revelli Hall, the 
band’s rehearsal space, helping 
then-Director of Operations 
Maggie St. Clair bag up banan-
as and bagels and granola bars 
for their trip to Ohio State last 
Nov. 24. St. Clair, decked out in 
maize and blue, turned to Ber-
toni.

“Kelly, make sure you have 

your breakfast, too.”

They embraced, then parted 

to load the buses. Bertoni didn’t 
know that simple early-morn-
ing conversation would be their 
last. She didn’t know that trag-
edy was about to strike. And 
she didn’t know that soon, she 
would be sitting in that same 
Revelli lobby, figuring out how 
best to honor St. Clair’s mem-
ory.

St. Clair was the de facto 

mom of the band. She organized 
everything — from coordinat-
ing trips to ordering uniform 
accessories to securing build-
ing access. More than that, she 
made herself available to any-
one who needed her. For over 
30 years, band members knew 
that if something was wrong, 

they could talk to her and she 
would listen. She would know.

Senior cymbals player Erin 

Sickrey 
remembers 
goofing 

around with her friends once 
in Revelli when the handle 
of a door broke off. Worried, 
Sickrey walked in holding the 
handle — and ran right into St. 
Clair. With her usual grace, St. 
Clair let Sickrey know it wasn’t 
a big deal, it could be fixed.

St. Clair took the time to get 

to know band members, even 
keeping in touch with alumni 
and asking about their fami-
lies. She was always there to 
say hi or offer a hug. And at 64, 
it seemed like she wouldn’t be 
stopping any time soon.

But shortly after loading the 

buses that November day, the 
students realized something 
was wrong. In the middle of 
attendance, they were told that 
there had been a medical emer-
gency. Eventually, administra-
tors confirmed it had been St. 
Clair, but there was little infor-
mation from the hospital or her 
husband at first.

And after the three-hour bus 

ride to Columbus, the students 
got lunch, then were told St. 
Clair had died.

“That was the worst day of 

my life,” said marching band 

director John Pasquale, one of 
the administrators tasked with 
bearing the bad news.

Shortly after, the band had 

to go out and perform a show 
in front of fans of their most 
hated rival, knowing they were 
in a hostile environment. Ohio 
State held a moment of silence 
for St. Clair in the Horseshoe 
and all things considered, the 
fans were pretty respectful. But 
that couldn’t possibly numb the 
pain in that moment.

To senior Lexi Willison, 

a trumpet player, the actual 
show that day was a blur. But 
she remembers all the other 
details. She, too, says it was one 
of the worst days of her life.

“Being there with everybody 

else, all of us going through the 
same thing, helped,” Willison 
said. “But nothing really could 
ever make up for the fact, what 
had happened, what we just 
experienced, us still having to 
go out there and do our jobs.”

When the band traveled to 

Atlanta for the Peach Bowl, 
it was clear just how much 
they had lost. Not only was St. 
Clair the emotional heartbeat 
of the band, she was also the 
one who organized the logis-
tics of a bowl trip — scouting 
the venue beforehand, making 

sure everything was ready to 
go — and there was an element 
of disorganization that wasn’t 
there before. Everyone could 
feel it.

In April, Bertoni and the 

rest of the show design com-
mittee met in the lobby of Rev-
elli. Their undertaking was, in 
some ways, normal. After all, 
the 
student-run 
committee 

meets every year, brainstorm-
ing show ideas for the next sea-
son. But this time, one loomed 
over the rest: a show to honor 
St. Clair.

St. Clair loved Lady Gaga 

and Bruno Mars. The commit-
tee discussed the merits of all 
those shows, but eventually 
landed on her favorite — Mary 
Poppins.

The 
student 
committee 

doesn’t have the final say in 
what shows make the sched-
ule. They present their ideas 
to Pasquale, and he decides 
which ones to run based on 
target demographics, difficul-
ty and how easy it is to secure 
the rights, among other things. 
Pasquale then announces the 
lineup at the beginning of band 
week — a two-week boot camp 
of sorts before school starts 
each year.

This year during band week, 

the members found out that 
not only were they doing Mary 
Poppins in honor of St. Clair, 
but they could go all out.

The marching band operates 

in show cycles based on how 
long they have to prepare for a 
given game. If there was a show 
the week before, it’s a one-week 
cycle — usually simpler shows 
that are easy to learn in less 
time. Because the band travels 
just to Michigan State, Notre 
Dame and Ohio State, the Big 
Ten season often operates in 
two-week show cycles, with an 
extra week to prepare when the 
team is away.

But this season, there was a 

quirk in Michigan’s schedule 
— an early season bye week, 
followed by an away game at 
Wisconsin, then a home tilt 
with Rutgers. That presented 
a rare opportunity: a three-
week show cycle. The longer 
the show cycle, the more intri-
cate the shows could be, and a 
three-week cycle — in which 
the band has three weeks to 
learn and prepare for one show 
— is a rare luxury.

The decision to use the Mary 

Poppins show for the Rutgers 
game was obvious. Mary Pop-
pins will be one of the lon-
gest and most difficult shows 

the band has ever done, and 
throughout rehearsals, the sec-
tion leaders have made it clear 
that a show that means so much 
needs to be perfect.

“This is probably the most 

seriously people have ever 
taken a show,” Sickrey said. “ 
… In other shows, you can goof 
off a little bit. It’s more fun. But 
for these ones, the rank lead-
ers are very much emphasiz-
ing, ‘There’s no excuses on this 
show, this has to be perfect, 
because this is the reason that 
we’re doing it.’ ”

There’s a story Willison tells 

some of the new members who 
didn’t know St. Clair or her 
impact on the band.

Her dad was in the marching 

band during his time at Michi-
gan in the late 1980s, and St. 
Clair was his director of opera-
tions, too. They’d stayed in 
touch, and near 2011, St. Clair 
invited the Willison family to 
tour Revelli during a rehearsal. 
St. Clair showed Lexi — a bud-
ding trumpet player in her mid-
dle school band — the trumpet 
lockers, pictures of past sec-
tions and a mural with a visual 
representation of the music for 
“The Victors.” The trip played 
a small role in Willison com-
ing to Michigan, and when she 

got there, St. Clair remembered 
her and asked about her par-
ents and her younger siblings.

St. Clair wasn’t known as 

the band mom for nothing. It 
was almost as if the St. Clair 
family and three decades of the 
Michigan marching band fam-
ily were one and the same, and 
nothing demonstrated that like 
St. Clair reaching out to Wil-
lison’s long-graduated dad and 
treating his entire family like it 
was her own.

When Willison was told of St. 

Clair’s death, she came to terms 
not only with what had hap-
pened, but the fact that she’d 
have to tell her dad — until she 
paraded into the stadium and 
a fellow band member pointed 
out that her parents were there 
in the audience. They’d come 
down to Columbus to surprise 
her. When the stadium PA 
announced a moment of silence 
for St. Clair, the secret was out.

After the game, as the band 

trekked back to its buses, Wil-
lison ran into her dad. They 
had a good cry together — two 
generations of marching band 
members touched by St. Clair 
and everything she did for the 
program.

There are different ways to 

drive home St. Clair’s impact 

for those who didn’t know 
her. Some people, like Bertoni 
— who grew up in St. Clair’s 
hometown of Chelsea, Mich., 
went to the same church as her 
family and worked as an assis-

tant to St. Clair for a semester — 
tell touching personal stories. 
Others only have to mention 
her job description. Even the 
freshmen realize how much 
goes into running a marching 
band, and that St. Clair did a 
lot of the dirty work you only 
see once you’ve been inside the 
Revelli doors.

“You think of the smallest 

details and that’s what Maggie 
did,” Bertoni said. “Ordering 
the ties for some of the GSIs 
and the scarves. She helped me 
get my uniform and just the dry 

cleaning, the bills and the man-
agement. … And I think a lot of 
people didn’t realize what that 
was until unfortunately with 
her passing, trying to analyze 
the situation, how we were 
going to move forward and best 
prepare moving forward, it was 
like, ‘Oh, Maggie was doing the 
job of like five people, that’s 

crazy.’ ”

Of 
course, 
the 
march-

ing band has a new director 
of operations now, Kimberly 
Smith, and Pasquale has taken 
the time to emphasize that 
she’s not St. Clair’s replace-
ment: “She’s not filling in Mag-
gie’s shoes, she’s making her 
own shoes,” as Sickrey recalls 
Pasquale’s message.

That alone is telling. Smith 

could do everything perfectly, 
but it would be nearly impos-
sible for anyone to match St. 
Clair’s impact.

When the marching band 

parades out of the tunnel 
Saturday against the Scarlet 
Knights, it will all mean more. 
It’s not just that they’re per-
forming St. Clair’s favorite 
music, or that the show is in 
honor of her, but that some of 
her family will be in the stands, 
along with countless alumni. 
On Sunday, the marching band 
is hosting a celebration of life, 
and many former members are 
coming back for it. The band 
will perform there, too — both 
their traditional repertoire like 
the fight song and alma mater, 
and selections from Mary Pop-
pins. The whole weekend will 
be dedicated to remembering 
St. Clair and gaining closure.

“It’s … difficult to imagine 

that this happened less than 
a year ago, in some ways, so 
it’s still kind of fresh,” Bertoni 
said. “And I think that that is 
something, sometimes I’m like, 
‘Wow, a lot has happened in 
that time,’ but at the same time, 
it’s still fairly recent.”

Nobody who was there will 

soon forget that morning in 
Columbus, but there’s no bet-
ter way to honor someone who 
gave her all to the Michigan 
marching band than putting 
on one of the most ambitious 
shows they’ve ever done — and 
approaching it with St. Clair’s 
enthusiasm and zeal.

When she was alive, knowl-

edge 
of 
St. 

Clair’s 

impact 
was 
largely 
con-
fined 
inside 
the 
doors 

of Revelli Hall. But on Satur-
day, in front of 100,000 people, 
the band will have an oppor-
tunity to convey a slice of who 
she was and what she meant 
to 30 years of marching band 
members.

“We’re all very much aware 

of why we’re doing this, who 
we’re doing this for,” Willison 
said. “And it’s an honor to be 
able to be one of the people who 
can 
honor 

her.”

What to watch for on Saturday: No. 20 Michigan vs. Rutgers

All week, an introspective air 
enveloped Schembechler Hall.
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
began the week by taking the 
blame 
for 
the 
Wolverines’ 
35-14 loss to Wisconsin on 
Saturday. His players followed 
up by criticizing their lack of 
effort and physicality. Both 
coaches who spoke Wednesday 
— linebackers coach Anthony 
Campanile 
and 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis 
— 
agreed the performance was 
unacceptable.
None of that will change 
Saturday when Rutgers comes 
to town. ESPN’s Power Index 
ranks the Scarlet Knights last 
among power conference teams. 
In the Harbaugh era, Michigan 
has beaten them by an average 
of 41.8 points per game.
So with victory not in much 
doubt despite the Wolverines’ 
lackluster start, here are five 
things to watch for Saturday 
that will impact the trajectory 
of Michigan’s season:
The final score
Yes, the final score does 
matter.
Obviously, Michigan needs 
to win. A loss would be the 
undisputed worst result of the 
Harbaugh 
era 
and 
legitimize 
concern over his 
future. But with 
the 
Wolverines 
favored by 27.5, 
that shouldn’t be 
too much of an 
issue.
What 
is 
an 
issue 
is 
the 
margin 
of 
victory. A repeat 
of week one’s 19-point win 
over Middle Tennessee would 
amplify concerns that this is the 
same uninspiring team that has 
slogged through its first three 
games.
A look at Michigan’s margins 
of victory over the past two 
years shows how much blowing 
out inferior opposition means. 
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
10-win 
season a year ago, they won four 
games by at least 35. The year 
before, their biggest margin of 
victory was 25, en route to an 

8-5 finish.
No 
opponent 
has 
better 
exemplified 
this 
difference 
than Rutgers. In the best year 
of the Harbaugh era, Michigan 
beat the Scarlet Knights, 78-0. 
Ten-win seasons in 2015 and 
2018 saw the Wolverines win by 
33 and 35, respectively. In that 
lackluster 2017 season, they won 
by just 21 at home.
How 
Michigan 
uses 
its 
receivers
If there was a positive to 
take 
away 
from 
Michigan’s 
demolition 
in 
Madison 
last 
weekend, 
it 
came 
from 
its 
receivers’ performances in the 
dying minutes.
All offseason, the assumption 
was 
that 
new 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis’ 
offense would emphasize junior 
receivers 
Donovan 
Peoples-
Jones, Nico Collins and Tarik 
Black. Instead, those three have 
just 33 targets combined so far 
(Peoples-Jones missed the first 
two weeks with injury).
Saturday, they finally became 
a major part of the gameplan, 
but only once the game was well 
out of reach.
“We’re not where we need to 
be in that room,” Gattis said of 
his receivers. “That falls on me. I 
gotta continue to get those guys 
better. We gotta continue to play 
with great detail 
and execute the 
fundamentals 
properly 
on 
each play that is 
important. When 
their 
level 
of 
play 
increases, 
it’ll 
also 
help 
everyone else.”
While 
Gattis’ 
hire was never 
about 
games 
like Rutgers, it will take a step 
toward what was promised with 
an increased emphasis on those 
three receivers.
Zach Charbonnet’s usage
In week two against Army, 
it seemed Michigan had its 
solution 
at 
running 
back. 
Freshman Zach Charbonnet saw 
33 carries and turned them into 
100 yards and a touchdown.
For all the early concern 
about the Wolverines’ offense, 
running back wasn’t one of 
them.

In first game since the loss in Madison, the Wolverines will look to rebound on both sides of the ball

ALLISON ENGVISKT/Daily
The Michigan football team will get its first shot to move forward from last week’s loss on Saturday against Rutgers.

We’re not 
where we need 
to be in that 
room.

Then rumors began to swirl 
over Charbonnet’s health. Against 
Wisconsin, he had just six yards on 
two carries, leading Harbaugh to 
explain that he was “limited” after 
the game.
The 
result 
was 
a 
woefully 
inefficient 
run 
game. 
On 
the 
first carry of the 
day, 
fullback-
turned-defensive-
tackle Ben Mason 
picked up three 
yards 
before 
fumbling. Backup 
quarterback Dylan 
McCaffrey 
led 
Michigan with 21 yards, as the 
Wolverines finished with 40 yards 
on 19 attempts.
Both 
Gattis 
and 
Harbaugh 
remained mum on Charbonnet’s 
health this week, but a repeat of 
his showing against Army would 
help quell concerns over the run 
game.
Patterson looking for bounce-
back game
While the Wolverines gained 
just 2.1 yards per carry against 
Wisconsin, 
their 
performance 
through the air wasn’t much 
better.
Patterson posted the lowest 
regular-season passer rating of his 
Michigan career, while completing 
just 14-of-32 passes. He repeatedly 
made the wrong reads, eschewing 
open receivers to throw into 
coverage and missing multiple 
ordinarily routine 
throws.
“Shea’s been out 
there in practice, 
and I think he’s 
preparing,” Gattis 
said. 
“There’s 
a 
level of remorse 
that he has. As 
far as some of the 
pressure 
that’s 
been 
applied 
to 
him, as well as 
some of the pressure that he’s put 
himself under. I believe in Shea. I 
believe in every one of our players. 
Shea has 100 percent of my support 
just like anyone else does.”
Part 
of 
the 
concern 
with 
Patterson has been his health. He 
suffered an oblique injury early in 
the season opener, before hurting 
his shoulder against Wisconsin, 
while the offensive line struggled 
to 
protect 
him. 
But 
with 
McCaffrey out with a concussion, 

Michigan has little choice but to 
keep Patterson under center.
Last year against Rutgers, he 
completed 18-of-27 passes for 
260 
yards, 
three 
touchdowns 
and no interceptions. A repeat of 
that performance 
would go a long 
way 
toward 
proving he can be 
the 
quarterback 
Michigan thought 
it had coming into 
the season.
How 
the 
interior 
defensive 
line 
bounces back
Of 
all 
the 
mishaps 
the 
Wolverines 
had 
against Wisconsin, their defensive 
line stood out.
While the offseason concern was 
over Michigan’s losses at defensive 
end and linebacker, the graduations 
of Bryan Mone and Lawrence 
Marshall loomed large against the 
Badgers.
Each of the last two seasons, 
Wisconsin’s offense has centered 
around 
All-American 
running 
back Jonathan Taylor. Last year, 
anchored by Mone and Marshall, 
the Wolverines held Taylor to a 
respectable 101 yards on 17 carries. 
Saturday, he doubled that total, 
rushing for 203 yards on 23 tries.
With Michael Dwumfour and 
Donovan Jeter both limited by 
injury, Michigan has tried to replace 
Mone and Marshall’s production 
in a myriad of ways. Senior Carlo 
Kemp has been a 
stalwart at one spot, 
but 
both 
Mason 
and defensive end 
Aidan Hutchinson 
have seen heavy 
usage next to him, 
each 
to 
limited 
success.
Both Dwumfour 
and Jeter should 
be 
healthy, 
though, and strong 
performances from either player 
alongside Kemp would help solidify 
Michigan’s 
troublesome 
run 
defense going forward.
Score prediction
Michigan’s going to win, and it 
won’t be close. That much is a given. 
But with the offense and defense 
both searching for their identities, 
it’ll be a lot closer — and less 
inspiring — than the Wolverines 
want.
Prediction: Michigan, 38-13

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
The Michigan offense has said that it is lacking an offensive identity, after touting its “speed in space” mantra all offseason.

What to watch for, 
continued from page 6

There’s a level 
of remorse 
that (Shea 
Patterson) has.

I believe in 
Shea. I believe 
in every one of 
our players.

HANDCRAFTED

I

t has become easy to forget 
there is a 
football 
game to play 
this weekend.
That’s in 
part because 
of the panic 
surrounding 
Michigan right 
now, after every 
problem came 
to a nadir at 
once last Sat-
urday. The resulting fallout from a 
blowout loss at Wisconsin has yet 
to settle. It’s also because the next 
opponent, Rutgers, can do little to 
settle it.
The Scarlet Knights are the 
worst program in the Big Ten and 
one of the worst in the country. 
The annual iteration of this game is 
usually a slow procession towards 
the clock striking zero, and to boot, 
Rutgers’ starting quarterback, 
McLane Carter, will miss this edi-
tion with a concussion. It’s hard to 
quell doubters in the way Michigan 
wants against this team.
But not impossible.

Three years ago in the lead-up to 
a trip to Piscataway, Jim Harbaugh 
was asked the inevitable question 
when an inevitable win awaits — 
one that dismissed the cliche of 
preparing for each opponent and 
tried to get at what the Wolverines 
could actually take away from the 
impending 60-minute formality.
“We’ll treat it as a big game,” 
Harbaugh said. “We will treat it as 
a championship game.”
Five days later, Michigan walked 
off the field with a 78-0 win. The 
Wolverines went for 605 total yards 
and held Rutgers to 39. When they 
were up 27-0, they went for two. 
Not only that, but they did so by 
faking the extra point. They played 
ruthlessly, but as close to perfect 
as you can play a game of football. 
They showed a killer instinct to the 
point of bad sportsmanship.
It’s not just the only time this 
century the Wolverines have won 
a game by 70, it’s one of just two 
they’ve won by 60 or more. The 
other was just weeks earlier in the 
same season, against Hawaii.
It was hard not to be think-
ing about the unyielding style of 

football Michigan used to play this 
week when, in the equivalent press 
conference five days before play-
ing Rutgers, Harbaugh brought up 
questions of effort and hustle.
He wasn’t alluding to Rutgers, 
an opponent where effort and hus-
tle might naturally stray, either. He 
was alluding to Wisconsin — which 

Michigan should have been amped 
up to play, a game where it wanted 
to prove something.
“Players have to focus. Always 
have to play with focus,” Harbaugh 
said. “That has to be coached, too. 
That’s not getting done.”
That’s a far cry from treating 
every game like a championship. 
So is the rest of the conversation 
around Schembechler Hall this 
week.
“Not trying to call out anyone,” 
said fifth-year senior tackle Jon 
Runyan Jr., “but I feel like there 
were some plays (against Wiscon-
sin) where the effort could’ve been 
better.”
“We’ve really faced some tough 
adversity — and not really neces-
sarily faced some tough adversity,” 
said offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis. “We’ve really kind of put 
ourselves in some tough adversity.”
“We didn’t want to put that on 
national TV,” said graduate trans-
fer defensive end Mike Danna. “We 
didn’t want that on our record or 
on our label or whatever. Because 
that’s not our identity and that’s 
not how we play football.”
Right now, though, it is how 
Michigan has played. It’s in the 
numbers, and it’s on the tape. The 
Wolverines have never been fur-
ther removed from that identity-
affirming 78-0 demolition than 
they are now.
It’s not much of a question as to 
whether Michigan will actually 
win this Saturday. It’s a 27.5-point 
favorite. But in their last six games 
against the spread, the Wolverines 
have failed to cover. All by at least 
two touchdowns.
Even under normal circum-
stances, just beating Rutgers 
wouldn’t be particularly notable. 

Here, it would be cause to keep 
the alarm bells ringing as Iowa, 
a real opponent with a chance of 
winning, comes to Ann Arbor next 
week.
To convince anyone of anything, 
covering the spread is a bare mini-
mum.
Want to get some confidence 
around this program again? Want 
to get everyone to shut up about 
what Michigan can’t do and open 
up some room for belief?
Treat this the way this team 
treated this game three years ago. 
Like a championship game. Play 
with a killer instinct. Don’t step off 
the pedal.
Show everyone what this 
offense’s ceiling is — how three 
NFL-level receivers can dominate, 
how a senior quarterback can lead, 
how this offensive line can plow 
open holes for its vaunted fresh-
man running back. Show everyone 
how this defense can dominate 
like Michigan has throughout Don 
Brown’s tenure as coordinator — 
everyone swarming the ball, the 
quarterback running for his life. 
There won’t be a better chance.
It won’t fix every problem, and 
being unable to kick the hell out of 
Rutgers isn’t one of the existential 
crises of the Jim Harbaugh era. But 
Rutgers is the opponent in front 
of the Wolverines this week, and 
doing that would at least be a start.
“You look through the game, 
you really don’t need to look at the 
stats,” Gattis said.
He was talking about last week. 
He should be able to say the same 
about this week.
