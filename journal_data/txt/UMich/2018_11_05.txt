Mohamed 
Soumah, 
a 
University of Michigan custodian, 
is currently seeking refuge in 
the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting 
House to avoid deportation — he 
requires frequent dialysis due to 
a genetic kidney disease, and says 
he will die if deported.
Soumah has lived in the U.S. for 
15 years after immigrating from 
Guinea, and has been employed 
with no past criminal history. He 
was married to a U.S. citizen with 
whom he has two children, who 
are also both citizens. Following 
their divorce, which invalidated 
the 
protection 
granted 
by 

marrying 
a 
citizen, 
Soumah 
has applied and been approved 
annually for U.S. work visas.
In an interview with MLive, 
Soumah said Guinea lacks the 
necessary equipment and training 
to provide him with dialysis three 
times per week.
“If I get deported, I will die,” he 
told MLive. “My mom died from 
the same disease seven years ago.”
The condition Soumah has 
cannot be treated with medication 
and his only options are a kidney 
transplant or frequent dialysis, a 
retired University physician also 
told MLive.

For 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Lauren 
Schandevel, 
creating 
a minorfocused on the study of 
socioeconomic class was a project 
that spanned her undergraduate 
career — it’s now finally coming 
to fruition. The proposed minor 
of class and inequality studies 
recently passed a faculty vote in 
the Women’s Studies Department 
and is awaiting approval from the 
LSA Curriculum Committee.
Schandevel 
first 
had 
the 
idea for an area of study on 
class during a discussion with 
Sociology Lecturer Dwight Lang 
three years ago. Since then, she 
has teamed up with students and 
faculty to draft the proposal. If 
the minor is approved, it would be 
the first study of social class at a 
university in the U.S., according to 
Schandevel.
“We did a lot of research when 
we were drafting the proposal 

Over

der Pluijm, professor of Geology, 
is interested in a different kind of 
waves made at the Big House this 
year, though: he’s leading a new 
initiative called the Michigan 
Shake Project, recording and 
analyzing the seismic activity 
that results from crowd response 
at Michigan football games.

and we were trying to see if there 
were similar programs at different 
universities that would just be 
studying class more broadly, and 
there weren’t any,” Schandevel 
said. “It’s another way to make 
sense of the world, and having 
a space to study it as its own 
minor gives it some credibility. 
And, 
hopefully, 
we’ll 
attract 
people across the country who 
are studying it in their own ways 
to come to the University and 
have this be a central location for 
analyzing those types of things.”
When 
Schandevel 
started 
looking into creating a new 
minor, she met with LSA senior 
Meaghan Wheat at the end of their 
freshman year. They discussed 
the idea further that summer, 
then began emailing faculty in 
different departments to gauge 

interest. After talking with people 
from various academic fields, 
Schandevel said she and Wheat 
met with Rosario Ceballo, who 
was the Women’s Studies chair in 
the 2017 winter term. Schandevel 
said Ceballo expressed interest in 
housing a program of class studies 
as a minor within the department.
From there, Schandevel said 
this partnership turned into a 
task force comprised of faculty 
from 
the 
Residential 
College 
and the Sociology Department. 
In addition, the task force had 
representation 
from 
different 
groups on campus, including the 
Program on Intergroup Relations, 
First-Generation College Students, 
Black-Asian 
Student 
Coalition, 
South Asian Awareness Network 
and Native American Student 
Association. 
The 
group 
met 
monthly to create the proposal for 
the minor.
“We found all the people for 
the task force: the faculty and the 

students,” Wheat said. “We really 

had a goal of having students 
who have different identities and 
different experiences … so that 
we weren’t just getting the same 
story about social class over and 
over and over again. We wanted 
to have that diversity and breadth 
of experience, and I think that 
we did succeed in that in the 
best of our ability. It was a lot of 
brainstorming among people who 
are super passionate, which was 
super empowering to be there and 
to listen.”
The task force finished its 
work at the end of the Winter 
2017 term. To get the minor 
approved, 
it 
would 
have 
to take its proposal to the 
Women’s Studies faculty for a 
vote and the LSA Curriculum 
Committee to be approved.
Schandevel 
said 
the 
proposal almost failed the 
full-faculty vote because of 
concerns about the curriculum 
requirements 
from 
some 
staff members. One of the key 
reasons it passed was because 
of faculty like Abby Stewart, 
a Sandra Schwartz Tangri 
distinguished 
university 
professor of psychology and 
women’s studies, who helped 
garner faculty support for the 
minor.
Stewart worked with the 
Women’s Studies faculty and 
edited the proposal based on 
their input. In October 2018, 
the proposal passed the faculty 
vote and now awaits a decision 
from the LSA Curriculum 
Committee.
“The 
task 
force 
asked 
Women’s Studies to consider 

sponsoring the minor, and the 
Department held discussions of it 
last spring, and then discussed it 
again this fall and voted to sponsor 
it,” Stewart wrote in an email. “We 
will propose it to LSA this semester 
for their consideration, which will 
take place on their timeline.”
In April 2018, former LSA 
Dean Andrew Martin emailed 
department chairs about the LSA 
Executive Committee’s decisionto 
place a hold on new minors housed 
within 
LSA. 
The 
reasoning, 
according to the email, was to 
halt the production of new minors 
and instead focus on reviewing 
existing minors. At the time of the 
decision, there were 111 minors 
available in LSA.
Though 
the 
Executive 
Committee’s 
ruling 
stands 
through 
this 
semester 
— 
theoretically barring approval of 
the proposal — Schandevel said the 
class minor will receive a decision 
thanks to help from LSA Associate 
Dean Angela Dillard and other 
administrators.
Now, Schandevel said what 
happens to the minor is mostly 
out 
of 
the 
students’ 
hands. 
She said the Women’s Studies 
administrators are tweaking the 
proposal based off concerns from 
faculty. Then, the administrators 
themselves will present it to the 
LSA 
Curriculum 
Committee. 
Schandevel 
said 
Dillard 
is 
advising the administrators on the 
presentation.
While the minor would be 
housed in LSA if approved, it is 
not restricted to students in other 
schools. 
Schandevel 
has 
had 
interest from students in the Ford 
School of Public Policy and Ross 
School of Business, in addition 
to students pursuing a variety of 
majors within LSA.
Schandevel said she and Wheat 
are still in disbelief that the minor 
is in its final stages. While she has 
had support, she said there have 
been people who questioned the 
necessity of the minor.

According to the same

percent increase in the 
fall freshman class of 
students whose 
household incomes are 
$65,000 or less. 
Additionally, about 26 
percent of in-state 
undergraduates are 
paying no tuition this 
semester. 

In a survey of 435 
University of Michigan 
students conducted by 
the Daily, 92 percent of 
polled students who are 
registered to vote in 
Michigan plan to vote in 
the gubernatorial election 
on Tuesday.

At a panel last Monday 
night, City Council 
members urged voters to 
fail Proposal A, which 
would reject the plans of 
constructing a 17-story 
building in the Library 
Lot downtown.

Among surveyed students 
who are registered to 
vote in Michigan, 69 
percent plan to vote for 
Gretchen Whitmer, 14 
percent plan to vote for 
Bill Schuette, 15 percent 
are unsure and 1 percent 
plan to vote for another 
candidate.

The panelists argued that 
the $5 million to 
construct the urban park 
could be used for 
affordable housing 
downtown instead.

Everything except the food

If you know me, the last 
thing you’ll mistake me for is 
being a picky eater.
Be it American food, Italian 
food, Chinese food or anything 
in between, I’ve probably tried 
it. Heck, I’ve even eaten fried 
silk worms in Thailand — trust 
me, they’re actually pretty 
good. But for whatever reason, 
the one food I never liked 
growing up was sadly, my 
own. Even though my parents, 
sister and grandparents in the 
states always loved Sri Lankan 
food, I personally never found 
it appealing.
Some of that I can pinpoint 
back to my seventh birthday 
party, on my first of six trips to 
Sri Lanka. Like any birthday 
party, it had cake, gifts and 
lots of people I barely knew 
showering me with hugs and 
kisses and pinching my cheeks 
until I was sore. When it got to 
dinner though, I expected all 
the food I liked, because it was 
my party.
Instead of trays of pizza, 
mac and cheese, and BBQ, 
however, I was greeted by 
chicken 
curry, 
parippu 
(a 

Sri Lankan version of dhal) 
and many other vegetables 
that didn’t seem the least bit 
appealing to a first grader 
dropped in a foreign country 
for the first time.
Naturally, 
I 
complained 
to my dad that I couldn’t eat 
anything at my own birthday 
party. That sounds reasonable 
enough, 
right? 
Well, 
he 
certainly 
didn’t 
think 
so, 
telling me to “never ask that 
again” and that I would enjoy 
Sri Lankan food for the rest of 
our trip. It might sound sort 
of shallow, but when you’re a 
kid, you don’t always want to 
do what your parents say. So I 
made it a point for the rest of 
my trip to eat as little curry, as 
little anything Sri Lankan, as 
possible.
And each time I came 
back to Sri Lanka, there was 
always some kind of dread in 
the back of my mind. Sure, I 
loved seeing my family who 
lived there, and I thoroughly 
enjoyed 
going 
to 
the 
tea 
plantations, 
beaches 
and 
temples around the country, 
but as petty it was, there was 
at least three moments every 
day I didn’t feel right.
What 
I 
didn’t 
realize 
then, and until recently, is 

appreciating 
your 
culture 
doesn’t 
mean 
liking 
everything about it. In the 
United States, there are so 
many things wrong with our 
society, but at the end of the 
day, being an American means 
accepting people for who they 
are, no matter what you don’t 
like about them.
That wasn’t a conclusion 
that was easy for me to reach 
until after the 2016 election, 
which created an environment, 
from my point of view, that 
made it easy for people to 
hate what was different with 
others rather than trying to 
appreciate those gaps. 
But it gave me a new outlook 
on my time in Sri Lanka. 
Though I wasn’t necessarily 
a fan of the food, I came 
back this summer with a new 
mindset. To truly accept my 
culture didn’t mean I had to 
love every single part of it, 
but it does mean I have to try 
my best to see the positives in 
every single part of it.
For the first time in ages, I 
miss Sri Lankan food. While I 
sit here writing this, enjoying 
a slice of New York Pizza 
Depot, something small inside 
me misses those vegetables.

Finding solidarity with other marginalized groups

I was recently at an open mic 
night for LGBTQ folks to tell 
their coming out stories. I was 
pleasantly surprised to find 
that, for a predominately white 
institution like the University 
of 
Michigan, 
the 
speakers 
and audience were both of 
a 
surprisingly 
multiracial 
composition. 
This 
pleasant 
feeling 
was 
unfortunately 
soon to leave me. Speaker after 
speaker told their narratives, 
some of which were heart-
wrenching, some of which were 
inspiring, most were both. I 
was transfixed by the sheer 
emotional weight of some of the 
stories, and by the bravery of 
the people who were willing to 
come up in front of an audience 
of at least a hundred to tell 
them.
This trance was soon broken. 
A white person walked up to the 

microphone to tell their story 
of coming out as nonbinary. 
A warning sign came when 
they described their boss only 
as “Indian,” with a sly wink 
to the audience, when what 
they meant to convey was that 
he was socially conservative, 
but 
instead 
chose 
to 
only 
showcase this by relying on 
misconceptions about Indian 
cultural 
values. 
I 
should 
mention this alone is a huge 
misconception 
about 
Indian 
notions of gender and sexuality 
— for one example among 
many, in pre-colonial India, 
hijras, as people identifying 
as neither male nor female are 
called, held important court 
positions, 
were 
considered 
religious authorities and often 
were sought after for blessings. 
It was only after the British 
imposed Western values on 
colonized India that they began 
to experience discrimination 
and criminalization, and the 
country is still in the process 

of decolonizing its cultural 
mindset.
This 
assumption 
about 

collective 
Indian 
ideas 
on 
gender 
and 
sexuality 
is 
offensive, but unfortunately it 
was not the worst thing in their 
monologue. I didn’t think much 
of it until a minute or two later, 
when, recounting an experience 
with 
their 
aforementioned 
Indian boss, they voiced him in 
a full-on racist stereotype Apu-
style Indian accent. To make it 
worse, about halfway through 
their imitation they tapered 
off to a half-assed-but-still-
derogatory 
accent, 
meaning 

they must have known that the 
accent was racist, performed 
it anyways, and then decided 
halfway through that maybe to 
do so was not the greatest idea.
To anyone who might dismiss 
imitating an accent as harmless: 
It’s not. To do so is a form 
of cultural imperialism that 
reduces the rich experiences of 
an entire group of people down 
to a singularity that is easy to 
mock, easy to other and easy to 
exclude. Being the only Indian 
kid in my grade in elementary 
school, middle school and one of 
two in high school, I can barely 
count the number of times 
another kid imitated an Indian 
accent in front of me, either as 
a way to try to make fun of my 
father (who doesn’t even have 
an accent), as a way to poke 
fun at my ethnic background 
or as a way to draw attention to 
my otherness. In each of these 
instances, I felt humiliated and 
often wished I didn’t have to be 
different — something no kid 

should ever have to feel.
There also seems to be a 
misconception 
among 
many 
people 
that 
holding 
one 
minority identity gives you a 
free pass to oppress others. 
The fact that this person was 
nonbinary absolutely does not 

give them a right to be racist. 
If anything, the fact that this 
occurred at an open mic night 
for LGBTQ folks makes it even 
worse — it was intended to be 
a safe space for marginalized 
people of all ethnic and racial 
backgrounds, and their outright 
racism violated the sanctity of 
that space. The same holds for 

people of color who discriminate 
against other people of color. 
Even back in school, most of the 
kids who made fun of me were 
also nonwhite (but not Indian), 
but they were still propagating 
racist attitudes against another 
minority group, and that is 
not acceptable no matter your 
color. Every one of us holds 
multiple identities, be it race, 
gender, sexuality or any other; 
in any one aspect, I may be 
more privileged than you or 
you may be more privileged 
than me. Those of us who don’t 
belong to the majority, for any 
aspect of our identity, must 
be careful not to promulgate 
forms of oppression against 
other 
marginalized 
groups. 
Fighting for social justice is 
not about cherry picking which 
marginalized groups you care 
to empower and disregarding 
the rest. Regardless of if we are 
people of color, LGBTQ or any 
other group, we should show 
solidarity.

Exploitation in The NFL

The 
prosperity 
of 
the 
modern 
National 
Football 
League in the U.S. is aided 
by 
white 
supremacy, 
i.e., 
the 
marginalization, 
commoditization 
and 
exploitation of the Black body.
It is clear that owners, 
affiliates, 
administration 
members, and even sports 
analysts and professors profit 
more from the game than 
the players themselves after 
the costs of time, energy and 
well-being are accounted for. 
Yet, opponents of this theory 
argue playing football is a 
choice, and if people don’t 
want to be taken advantage of, 
they shouldn’t play football. 
Or worse, even if Black players 
are being taken advantage of, 
it’s not that bad because they 
still make a lot of money. But 
these 
notions 
perpetuate 
harmful stereotypes about the 
intellect, responsibility and 
the agency of Black players. 
Further, these ideas fail to 
acknowledge the deep-seeded 
truth: Black players are used 
for their bodies to make their 
owners a profit at 
the expense of 
their 
own 
sanity 
and 

well-
being.

The average 
player in the NFL 
is paid $2 million a 
year. The average owner 
makes between $20 million 
and $500 million a year. That 
means even on the lower end, 
owners make ten times on the 
lower quartile of their pay 
scale more than players on 
the median/average quartile 
do. 
Not 
to 
mention, 
the 
injuries sustained in football 
are unparalleled to any other 
modern day, hegemonic sport. 
According to the New York 
Times and TIME magazine, 
“The link between football 
and traumatic brain injury 
continues to strengthen. Now, 
one of the largest studies on 
the subject to date finds that 
110 out of 111 deceased NFL 
players had chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy 
(CTE), 
a 
degenerative brain disorder 
associated 
with 
repetitive 
head trauma.” CTE can cause 
impulse 
control 
problems, 
aggression, 
depression 
and 
paranoia. As time goes on, 
problems with thinking and 

memory develop: memory loss, 
confusion, impaired judgment 
and 
eventually 
progressive 
dementia.
Everything these players 
do, from putting their (mostly 
colored) bodies on the line 
in the name of money, to 
contracting a disease as severe 
as CTE, is political. These 
players, mostly of color, are 
doing 
everything 
in 
their 
power to make a living by 
playing 
a 
very 
dangerous 
game. The owners reap far 
too many of the benefits 
for this to not be aided by 
larger power structures, like 
white supremacy, or owner 
versus player administrative 
dynamics. 
The 
amount 
of 
money these players produce 
versus how much they are paid 
versus how much the owners 
of teams are paid 
is 
absolutely 

astounding 
once one has done 
their due diligence with the 
research.
70 percent of the NFL is 
Black, and yet there exists 
a 
dull 
hum 
around 
that 
statistic. This is a reality few 
openly 
acknowledge. 
It 
is 
never a headline on ESPN, 
nor is it ever discussed in 
depth. 
Colin 
Kaepernick’s 
act of kneeling during the 
national 
anthem 
sparked 
nationwide controversy over 
the 
patriotism 
of 
football 
players, and whether they are 
required to stand for a country 
that does not stand for them. 
There 
is 
undoubtedly 
an 
expectation of colorblindness 
and respect for the American 
flag despite the fact white 
and Black counterparts of 
same crime are treated vastly 
differently by judicial system, 
killings of unarmed Black 
men is a reality, white cops 
shooting with impunity, etc. 

Participants of sports have 
long been encouraged to be 
apolitical and ignorant of 
social conditions, even though 
their bodies inherently occupy 
political space because of the 
United States’ legacy of slavery, 
colonialism and Jim Crow. 
When sportscasters try to 
engage in conversations about 
race or white supremacy, they 
are disciplined or fired. (See: 
Kaepernick, 
Jemele 
Hill). 
Further, 
these 
repressive 
consequences that result from 
discussing the color of the 
talent and/or socio-political 
factors that push players into 
football breed colorblindness.
If we don’t talk about how 
the best and most talented 
players in football tend to be 
Black and undercompensated 
compared 
to 
the 
white 
administrators, 
public 
and 
popular 
discourse 
will 
remark 
that 
disparities 
do 
not 
exist. 
This 

blindness 
(and 
ignorance) 
is 
profitable. Maintaining 
the 
status 
quo 
is 
profitable. Failing to 
understand or combat 
racism institutions is 
profitable. 
Ignorance 
is 
bliss. 
But 
this 
is 
dangerous. By continuing 
to be being a patron of 
institutions 
that 
actively 
marginalize and commodify 
the 
bodies 
of 
Black 
and 
Brown folk without adequate 
compensation, 
we 
stymie 
social progress. Clearly, the 
globalization of the modern 
world and the world of sport 
has allowed for a power 
structure where the people 
who manage the game earn 
much more in compensation 
(monetary or otherwise) than 
those who play it.
Undergirding this love is 
a pernicious and insidious 
power structure that keeps 
the players from receiving 
compensation tantamount to 
the risk, injuries and political 
capital they would sustain if 
never used by the NFL and 
NCAA as chess pieces in a 
game to uphold class and 
racial struggle.

T

he 
2018 
November 
election will be closely 
watched 
across 
the 
country for the impact it will 
have at the state and federal 
levels, but even here in Ann 
Arbor, voters will have the 
opportunity to cast a vote with 
a long-lasting impact on our 
city. Appearing on Ann Arbor 
ballots is Proposal A, which 
concerns a city-owned plot 
of land, popularly called the 
“Library Lot,” adjacent to the 
downtown branch of the Ann 
Arbor District Library.
The Library Lot is currently 
a parking lot, as it has been 
for roughly the last 70 years. 
In 
2009, 
an 
underground 
parking structure was added, 
which opened for use in 2012. 
Since that time, Ann Arbor 
administrators and City Council 
have considered various options 
for what to do with the land at 
the surface. Last year, in an 8 
to 3 vote, the mayor and other 
members of the City Council 
approved the selection of a 
proposal from Chicago-based 
developer Core Spaces to buy 
the land and build a mixed-
use building on it. Though the 
paperwork has been signed to 
execute it, the sale is currently 
on hold pending the outcome 
of a lawsuit filed by two of the 
other members of City Council 
challenging its validity. And 
Proposal A would only further 
complicate matters.
Proposal A appears on the 
ballot as follows:
Charter 
Amendment 
for 
the City-Owned Public Land 
Bounded by Fifth Avenue, and 
William, Division, and Liberty 
Streets to be Designated, in 
Perpetuity, as an Urban Park 
and Civic Center Commons to 
be Known as the “Center of the 
City,” by Amending the Ann 
Arbor City Charter Adding a 
New Section 1.4 to Chapter 1 of 
the Charter.
Shall the City-owned public 
land bounded by Fifth Ave, and 
William, Division and Liberty 
Streets be retained in public 
ownership, in perpetuity, and 
developed as an urban park and 

civic center commons, known 
as the “Center of the City” by 
adding a new section for the 
purpose as explained above?
The very first word identifies 
a 
key 
point: 
The 
proposal 
would amend the City Charter, 
the 
highest-level 
governing 
document of Ann Arbor and 
not somewhere that land use 
normally would appear. The City 
Charter is at issue here, because 
the normal process for land 
use has already been employed 
(resulting in the mentioned sale 
to Core Spaces). By amending 
the Charter, Proposal A would 
circumvent the normal process 
and invalidate the actions of 
City Council by removing their 
authority to determine how 
the property should be used. 
One of the reasons that land 
use does not typically appear 
in the City Charter is that it 
tends to change more frequently 
than such provisions permit — 
City Council regularly votes to 
approve leases, easements and 
other modifications to land use, 
and has bought and sold land 
before, unhindered by such 
a constraint. But Proposal A 
makes clear that its endurance 
is intentional by specifying that 
the Library Lot would retain its 
new status “in perpetuity.”
What, then, is that status? 
The proposal would designate 
the Library Lot as the “Center 
of the City,” an “urban park 
and civic center commons.” 
While this leaves some room for 
flexibility, City Council clearly 
does not have plans to realize 
such a vision (having instead 
made the previously-described 
arrangement with Core Spaces), 
and, more concerningly, it seems 
the 
supporters 
of 
Proposal 
A may not either. Leaders 
of the group responsible for 
organizing this support suggest 
the “collective vision” of the 
community will drive what is 
to be done with the land once it 
is secured in the City Charter, 
and that there are various 
opportunities for securing the 
necessary funding to implement 
this vision. But we cannot, as 
responsible voters, allow our 

city’s policy to be permanently 
decided based on the hope for 
what might be rather than the 
facts we have before us.
The 
funding 
that 
would 
be necessary to change the 
current 
surface-level 
lot 
to 
something resembling a park 
or commons is not mentioned 
in the language of the proposal, 
and has not been allocated or 
raised in the 70 years during 
which the property has been in 
its current form. Furthermore, 
the proposal does not address 
the city’s current plans for the 
property. As part of the sale 
to Core Spaces, the city would 
assign $5 million from the 
sale to the Ann Arbor Housing 
Commission for the purpose of 
supporting affordable housing 
elsewhere in the city, and 
collect $2.3 million annually 
in property taxes from the new 
owners. This revenue has no 
counterpart in Proposal A.
The facts we’ve laid out are 
among the reasons that Proposal 
A is opposed by the Ann Arbor 
Housing 
Commission, 
who 
recognize the value of both 
the housing in the proposed 
Core Spaces development and 
the additional money it would 
provide for affordable housing, 
and the Board of the Ann Arbor 
District Library, which as the 
next-door neighbor to either 
a new building or a new park, 
stands to be most immediately 
affected. Ann Arbor urgently 
needs more housing, and the 
Library Lot is an appropriate 
location for this level of density. 
The 
resulting 
additional 
funding for more affordable 
housing efforts will ensure that 
the entire community stands to 
benefit. We oppose Proposal A, 
which would pull the rug out 
from under the careful process 
that led to this plan, and hope 
that you will consider doing the 
same.

D

uring 
senior 
year 
of 
high school, my choir 
performed at a conference 
in Chicago. Singing was wonderful, 
but more importantly, it was a fun 
trip for my friends and me as we 
wrapped up our final semester. 
During some free time, my friend 
Jesse and I wandered the streets 
around our hotel in search of coffee 
and pastries, still thrilled by the 
novelty 
of 
independence, 
even 
knowing that in a few short months 
it would be our new way of life.
We found a coffee shop. We got 
drinks and split a peanut butter 
banana chocolate scone (it would 
be important to him that I include 
this detail). Nestled into some high-
backed armchairs by a large window 
overlooking the frigid February 
streets, we chatted about nothing 
in particular, taking bites from the 
pastry on the table between us. 
Jesse and I have been best friends 
since kindergarten. We had most 
of our classes together, traveled 
together and did all the same 
extracurriculars. We hadn’t ever 
been apart except for a month every 
summer when we attended different 
camps.
As we sat and enjoyed the comfort 
of being with someone who you 
know so well, I was struck by the 
transience of such moments. In a 
few months, who knew what would 
happen? I would be starting school 
in Ann Arbor and he would be 6,000 
miles away on a gap year in Israel. We 
would be in different time zones on 
different continents going through 
completely different experiences. I 
always had an ironclad confidence 
our friendship could make it through 
anything unscathed. For a moment, 
that wavered.
Jesse nudged the plate toward me, 
offering me the last chunk of scone. 
For some reason, that small gesture 
was a sweet reassurance. I happily 
accepted, popping the bite into my 
mouth and pulling up the Notes app 
on my phone. With a smirk, I wrote, 
“You know it’s a friendship that will 
transcend the distance and the years 
and the changes when he gives you 
the last bite of his scone.”
I have always been intrigued 
by time travel. Not to some distant 
historical event or unknown future 
world, but rather to somewhere 

along my own timeline. I try to find 
ways to hop between the years of my 
life, showing myself the past or the 
future, a reminder of where I came 
from and where I might be going. 
Sometime in September each year 
I flip through all the pages in my 
calendar, travelling to the last week 
of school, and write myself a note: 
“Here is where I am, here’s where 
you may be, I guess you know what 
I got on the exam I took this week, 
huh?” In the spring I find these notes 
and smile, finding some nugget of 
naïveté within myself from just a few 
months before.

In high school, I would write 
myself time bomb emails, scheduling 
them to arrive one year from that 
day. I found it oddly comforting to 
read about my concerns from the 
year before, seeing them in the wide-
angle lens of hindsight, and knowing 
whatever problems I currently had 
would be similarly trivial in a year’s 
time. By remembering exactly how 
it felt to be that girl a year before, 
I suddenly become her again for a 
moment, and I could see straight 
through to the future.
In the other direction, I leave 
observational breadcrumbs through 
the musings and lines of prose from 
which I gained inspiration for this 
semester’s column. They allow me to 
travel backward, reminding me how 
I saw the world at a younger age.
I was thinking about how 
reassured I was that day in the 
coffee shop as I drove Jesse to 
the airport last weekend. He 
goes to school in Atlanta, and 
had flown up for a visit. We spent 
the weekend doing nothing in 
particular, talking about nothing 
in particular. We just enjoyed the 
familiarity that comes from 15 

years of close friendship. It wasn’t 
sad to say goodbye. I’ll see him 
again soon.
As I go through my life, I try to 
leave touchstones to which I can 
return and mark the passage of 
time and the unpredictability of 
life’s journey. I have never felt as 
though I am only my present self, 
but rather like a Russian nesting 
doll with past versions saved 
somewhere in my head, fitting 
into one another seamlessly and 
augmenting what was already 
there. Like some ancient redwood, 
each year I add a new layer of self as 
I grow outward into the world. I am 
20 years old, but I am 18 and 15 and 
11 too, the thoughts, experiences 
and perspectives compounding 
into one hodgepodge of a person.
As each year passes, I see how 
time can strip away whatever is 
not tied down tightly. I have lots 
of once-close friends with whom I 
never speak. I spent hours honing 
skills my hands and mind have 
since forgotten. I do not mourn 
these losses. They are preserved, 
if not in the present, then in some 
past self. I will relive long gone 
friendships and memories with 
the next time bomb email. I will 
remember how it felt to perform 
at a choral conference or do a slide 
tackle in a soccer game the next 
time I scroll through Notes on my 
phone.
More 
than 
anything, 
my 
adventures through time have 
taught me that a year from now, 
everything 
will 
be 
different, 
except for the things that won’t. 
I’ll always know how to string 
sentences together. I’ll always 
want to share a blanket with my 
big sister on the couch watching 
reruns of the “The West Wing.” 
I’ll 
always 
read 
before 
bed, 
have a penchant for righteous 
indignation and surround myself 
with kind-hearted people. And I’ll 
always want to split a scone with 
Jesse. I will shed the things I do 
not need and hold tightly to those 
I cannot live without, and march 
forward through time until I can 
meet next year’s me.

Vote no on Proposal A

O

n Oct. 25, Steven Crowder 
made 
a 
visit 
to 
the 
University of Michigan, 
broadcasting his podcast “Louder 
with Crowder” live from the 
Power Center of Performing Arts. 
Notorious 
for 
his 
unabashed 
honesty, one of Crowder’s main 
tenants is to break from the 
constraints of the “leftist” media 
and allow for free, uncensored 
speech. This got me thinking 
about media bias, something that 
has become prominent in the 
American political landscape ever 
since President Donald Trump rose 
to power during his “fake news” 
campaign. When you think about it, 
though Crowder may have escaped 
the liberally-rooted mainstream 
media, isn’t his show equally biased 
in the conservative direction? Not 
having analyzed his show enough, 
I’m not necessarily one to say; yet, 
with all this attack on the media, I 
did begin to wonder: Is there really 
anything wrong with media bias?
When it comes to something 
as rooted in subjectivity as bias, 
it 
becomes 
very 
difficult 
to 
objectively rate a source based on 
this benchmark. Neutral politics 

have become quite a rarity in the 
mainstream political field, and as 
a result, it has become increasingly 
difficult to find an easy way to 
discover a centrist source that 
doesn’t have any allegiance to 
either side. That said, however, a 
Gallup Poll found that 45 percent 
of Americans believe the media is 
biased and a whopping 66 percent 
believe the news media does not 
do a good job separating fact from 
opinion. Numbers don’t lie; it’s 
obvious that this seems to be a big 
problem to many American citizens.
The question then becomes, 
is it possible for someone to be 
unbiased? Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University believe bias is 
intrinsic and unavoidable. In fact, 
it has been known for a while that 
everyone pretty much has inherent 
biases. Individuals are shaped by the 
environments and cultures in which 
they were brought up. Each different 
person grows up prioritizing some 
values over others. In that way, each 
person ends up with drastically 
different natural biases. As such, 
asking for an unbiased news report 
is truly impossible. But, asking for 
facts and not “fake news” isn’t.

Understanding inherent biases 
is a big step in being able to better 
make informed decisions on what’s 
true and false as well as what’s fact 
and opinion. It’s OK for a reporter 
to offer his or her opinion on a fact 
or a news piece. In fact, this is what 
makes up most of the roundtable 
discussions 
we 
see 
on 
NBC, 
CNN, FOX and other major news 
networks. However, when a news 
source intentionally skews a fact or 
even purposefully leaves out some 
aspects of the truth, it becomes 
detrimental to the integrity of 
the media as a whole. This type 
of propaganda is what has driven 
many Americans away from some 
networks that have been blasted 
for being unreliable and not based 
on true fact. The media is obviously 
free to do whatever it wants, but 
excessive prejudice can lead to 
disillusionment among the people. 
We have seen the effects of this; it’s 
the last thing we would want.

O

n Nov. 8, 2016, I fell asleep 
early, before the doubt 
crept into anyone’s mind, 
before 
the 
results 
came in. I fell asleep 
sure, as I was sure 
about anything, that 
I would wake up to 
the making of history. 
If I had had any 
doubt in my mind, I 
would certainly not 
have found the peace 
required to sleep at 
such an important 
moment.
Sometime around 4:00 a.m., 
I awoke to my TV blaring, still 
showing the same pundits usually 
on during primetime trying to 
explain — if not understand, 
themselves — the results of the 
election. It was so shocking. So 
unpredicted. 
So 
confounding. 
Still half asleep, I struggled to 
even catch my breath. It was quite 
literally a gut punch, immediately 
sending actual, shooting pains to 
all parts of my body. Deep in my 
bones, I felt a pain so visceral, so 
raw, that tears still fill my eyes 
and my chest still feels hollow just 
recalling that night, even two years 
later.
When I was first introduced 
to 
politics 
during 
the 
2008 
presidential election, I remember 
remarking to my parents that I 
didn’t like then-Senator Barack 
Obama, because “He was trying 
to take the presidency away from 
women.” Of course, I eventually 
grew to fall in love with Obama, 
but even then, I was thirsting for 
a certain recognition. I longed 
for an explicit, loud recognition 
and celebration of femininity 
and my womanhood. The only 
way to quench my thirst for this 
recognition was for it to be loud 
enough to turn enough heads: 
the election of the first female 
president of the United States.
Suffice to say, eight years 
later, deeper into my feminist 
awakening, 
I 
was 
positively 
desperate for my country to send 
some signal — any signal — that 
my identity as a woman was a 
gift, not a flaw, as it most often 
was growing up in conservative 
Indiana. When Secretary Clinton 
appeared to almost guarantee a 

final conquest of the last frontier, 
I was elated. Finally! Finally, this 
country would see all of the things 
women uniquely offered 
to leadership. Finally, 
little girls would be able 
to look up to a woman 
in the Oval Office and 
dream 
big 
dreams. 
Finally, I would be seen 
as fully human, capable 
of the same successes as 
my foremothers.
And then the worst 
happened. Our broken 
system 
diverted 
the 
election 
of 
Hillary 
Rodham 
Clinton, 
arguably 
the 
most 
qualified person ever to run for 
president, to someone clearly less 
experienced, less qualified and 
exhibiting less humanity. I was 
simply hopeless.
In the last two years, I have 
felt a similar, though not quite the 
same, hopelessness. I felt hopeless 
after the administration signed 
a grotesque executive order to 
ban Muslim immigrants from 
the country. I felt hopeless after 
evil people marched the streets 
of 
Charlottesville 
screaming 
“Jews will not replace us.” I felt 
hopeless after hundreds of people 
in Las Vegas and many students in 
Parkland, Fla., were slaughtered. 
I felt hopeless when children 
were ripped from their parents’ 
arms and placed into cages. I felt 
hopeless when the overturning of 
Roe v. Wade was all but guaranteed 
after 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Anthony Kennedy announced his 
retirement, and again when our 
government chose to confirm an 
unsuitable man to the highest court 
in the land after hearing the tragic 
testimony of a woman credibly 
accusing him of sexual assault 
and attempted rape. Now, I feel 
hopeless in the days after 11 Jewish 
congregants in Pittsburgh were 
massacred while they worshipped.
While there have been many 
more hopeless moments since 
that painful night in 2016, I still 
have hope. There are few places 
to find hope or joy in these dark 
days, but there is so much hope to 
draw upon from the hundreds of 
women running for office up and 
down the ballot, ready to be elected 
tomorrow. They will pick up and 

carry the torch of righteousness 
America dropped on Nov. 8, 2016, 
and uphold the legacy of our 
foremothers, 
including 
Hillary 
Rodham Clinton.
From Stacey Abrams in Georgia 
to Gina Ortiz Jones in Texas to 
Rashida Tlaib right here in Detroit, 
women, especially women of color, 
have put their foot down to limit 
the damage this administration 
can do to the American people and 
stood up to be the next leadership of 
this country. Instead of employing 
respectability politics and leaning 
into the already broken system, 
these women have decided to just 
take over the whole thing. They 
are ready to reject the same old 
advice the same old Washington 
consultants give them, which is to 
just basically conform and contort 
yourself into some half-priced, 
bargain bin version of a male 
politician. They are embracing 
their femininity and experiences 
related to their female identity to 
inform their political choices and 
strategies 
with 
understanding, 
experience and, most importantly, 
know-how.
They are ready to fight to 
make Washington work for the 
American people again, not to 
give huge tax cuts to the rich 
and 
corporations. 
They 
are 
ready to fight for health care and 
education, especially for those 
that need it most. Finally, for all of 
the little girls and boys, and even 
some of us in our college years, 
these women are the beacon of 
hope for the future of this country 
— our futures.
So when you go to the polls — 
and please, vote! — tomorrow, 
keep these women in mind 
as a unique, improved type of 
leadership able to fill the void 
in 
this 
country 
by 
holding 
this 
immoral 
administration 
accountable and working on 
behalf of the American people. 
While I am literally a card-
carrying 
Democrat 
excited 
about the possibility of a wave of 
Democratic candidates on their 
way to Washington, I am most 
hopeful about the pink wave 
coming to defend all of us.

The 
phrase 
“always 
a 

bridesmaid, 
never 
a 
bride” 

instantly comes to mind upon 
reading Busy Philipps’s (“I Feel 
Pretty”) filmography. She has 
built a lengthy and impressive 
career playing the best friend or 
another member of the ensemble. 
Despite being featured in movies 
and television now considered pop 
culture milestones like “White 
Chicks” or “Freaks and Geeks,” 
she has never helmed her own 
vehicle, which is why it seemed so 
unexpected, yet slightly intriguing 
that she would be given the 
opportunity to host a talk show.

In hindsight, “Busy Tonight” 

has many elements that should 
have assured its success. The title 
is snappy, Tina Fey is credited 
as an executive producer and it 
faces little to no competition in 
inheriting the female late night 
talk show throne that Chelsea 
Handler so recently abdicated. The 
only problem that presented itself 
is Philipps’s occupation in a weird 
purgatory of Hollywood. She is not 
an unknown, nor is she a household 
name. Thus, she is familiar enough 
to be recognizable, but unfamiliar 
enough that it is easy to question 
why one would tune into her, of all 
people, every night.

This issue did not have to be a 

dealbreaker, as Philipps’s relative 
obscurity could have been used 
as a means to introduce her show 
— as well as herself — to the world 

on her own terms. But, instead of 
gently wading into the pool, “Busy 
Tonight” cannonballs in, almost 
giving viewers whiplash with 
how strong its host comes across. 
Through her numerous half-baked 
(and frankly, forced) references to 
self-care, margaritas and feminism 
that feel ripped from some boring 

30-something’s Pinterest board, 
Philipps does not come across 
as a relatable host, but rather as 
an actress doing a bad job with a 
character piece.

To clarify, it is important to 

acknowledge the difficulty in 
beginning a new talk show. When 
one becomes accustomed to long-
running hosts, gimmicks, sets 
and other standards of a show, it is 
easy to critique aspects that make 
a show appear to be fledgling. 
In addition to the audience’s 
perception of a show, it is also 
grueling for the people behind the 
scenes to find a niche and develop 
a tone. While “Busy Tonight” 
definitely suffers from the regular 
growing pains of a new television 
show (like a low-budget title 
sequence and a closing musical 
number that enticed me to throw 

my computer at the television), its 
central problem is a simple lack of 
entertainment value.

The 
very 
brief 
20-minute 

stretch of the program quickly 
felt like pulling teeth, as there 
were many elements that simply 
felt purposeless. For example, at 
the beginning of each episode, 
Philipps begins a conversation 
with her writers, who are sitting 
nearby in the studio audience. 
These exchanges are played off 
as “improvisational,” yet feel as 
forced as a fourth grader reading 
from their new knock-knock joke 
book. Making matters worse, 
these moments are not blips in 
the episode, and the bits last for 
far too long, quickly veering into 
awkward territory.

This stark lack of entertainment 

value also expands into the 
celebrity interview segment as 
well. Rather than prompting the 
stars with questions that will 
launch them into a funny anecdote 
about their lives or the project they 
are promoting, Busy, in a clear 
attempt to maintain the phony 
“chill” vibe of the show, just carries 
on a normal conversation with 
them. This, in itself, is not a terrible 
idea. However, the idea does not 
translate well, as the conversations 
lack any semblance of direction, 
and the only topics that seem to be 
game for discussion are Coachella, 
SoulCycle, margaritas and crying. 
For someone who starred in “White 
Chicks,” she should have better 
awareness of when she is coming 
across as a grating stereotype. In 
addition to the uninspired talking 

points, Philipps 
herself is not the 
best interviewer. 
For example, in 
her 
interview 

with 
Vanessa 

Anne Hudgens, 
Philipps 
fails 

to 
facilitate 

a 
natural 

conversation, 
and 
opts 
to 

interrupt 
her 
guest 
at 

numerous 
points 
throughout 
the 
interview, 

as 
well 
as 

consistently 
re-center herself 
as the subject of 
conversation.

As evidenced 

in the past with 
other talk show 
flops, 
“Kris” 

and “The Queen 
Latifah Show,” 
not everyone is 
cut out to be a 
talk show host. 
After watching 
the 
first 
four 

episodes, it is 
clear that the 
issues 
with 

“Busy Tonight” 
will 
not 
be 

solved in due 
time. Lack of 
charm 
cannot 

be 
as 
easily 

remedied 
as 

someone simply 
forgetting their 
cues. As much 
as I hoped for 
this to be a 
career-making 
highlight 
in 

Philipps’s 
career, it seems 
as though this is 
going to be one 
that she buries 
and 
tries 
to 

forget. I know I 
want to.

Yaeji had El Club’s sweaty 
walls banging last week

I don’t remember the first 

time I heard “raingurl,” the 
single that launched Brooklyn-
based electronic music artist 
Yaeji into the limelight. I can’t 
put my finger on when the song 
started to worm its way into 
my friend group, who exactly 
turned to who first and said: 
“Wait, you have to listen to this 
song.”

All I know is that one day 

towards the end of the summer 
“raingurl” 
just 
appeared, 

already deeply rooted in road 
trip 
playlists 
and 
morning 

walks to class — the soundtrack 
to pregames and parties and 
every social event in between. 
The song’s muted ease holds a 
quiet fortitude, from the initial 
“make it rain girl, make it rain” 
that quickly collapses into a 
sweeping beat to throughout 
the rest of the track, as 
whispered 
lyrics 
in 
both 

Korean and English dance off 
each other, gathering into the 
final culmination of, “Mother 
Russia in my cup / And my 
glasses foggin’ up / Oh yeah 
hey dog hey what’s up / Oh 
yeah hey dog hey what’s up.” 
“raingurl” is a track that builds 
without release; each element 
of the song is muffled, as if 
wrapped in gauze, and it wraps 
you up in a similar way: Even 
as you try to move the song to 

strictly background noise, your 
foot can’t help but tap out the 
rhythm. Your mouth can’t help 
but mimic the omnipresent: 
“Make it rain girl, make it rain.”

It’s a banger that doesn’t 

announce itself, but instead 
sweeps you up for the ride 
without 
hesitation 
— 
a 

disposition that seems to be 
paralleled by Yaeji herself, as 
she appeared to at the forefront 
of El Club’s stage last Tuesday, 
round glasses reflecting the 
club’s strobe lights back out 
into the audience. Emerging 
suddenly and barely tall enough 
to be seen above the waving 
arms of the first row, Yaeji was, 
at first, distinctly unimposing. 
Yet, as she launched into 
her opener “Feel It Out,” 
she transformed. Her stage 
presence grew larger-than-life 
as all of the glory of the song’s 
spiraling synths alongside her 
hypnotic vocals washed the 
room with colorful energy. As 
the song bounced from one 
corner to the other, so did she, 
and our own bodies couldn’t 
help but follow. We were 
caught up in the enthusiasm 
of the moment and of the song 
itself. We were entrapped. We 
were entranced.

More than anything, more 

than any other show I’ve 
attended at El Club, we were 
having fun. Throughout the 
setlist, as “Feel It Out” bled 
into the hollow of “Full Of 
It,” as “Guap”’s deep baritone 

flattened into “after that”’s 
off-kilter crawl, even as the 
wildly popular cover of Drake’s 
“passionfruit” 
settled 
over 

us like a blanket, we were 
never allowed to stop moving. 
And neither did we want to, 
with each song in the lineup 
gaining energy from the track 
that came before, the space 
around us sparking with raw 
kineticism. 

Yaeji 
left 
“raingurl,” 

predictably, 
until 
the 
very 

end, letting the final echoes of 
the song fully die out before 
expressing her gratitude and 
joy in seeing all of us fill El 
Club’s space to its capacity in 
a quiet voice that belied the 
utter chaos of only moments 
before. It is this unassuming 
quality that makes Yaeji, and 
her 
entire 
discography, 
so 

powerful. Instead of forcing 
themselves upon listeners, the 
songs simply invite a hand out, 
welcoming you to dance with 
them, outwardly express with 
them.

And as Yaeji climbed back 

onstage for the encore — her 
remix of Charli XCX’s “Focus” 
— I felt the synergy, between 
Yaeji and us, between us and 
the song, at its peak. Together, 
we closed out El Club, the 
song’s hook — “I just want 
you to focus on my love / Just 
focus on my” — becoming all-
consuming as we raised our 
voices to match Yaeji’s: one 
final, perfect harmony.

The legacy of artist and 

activist Victor Jara

On Sept. 11, 1973, the Chilean 

president, a socialist named 
Salvador Allende, was forcibly 
removed in a military coup led 
by the brutal general Augusto 
Pinochet. For the next 20 years, 
Pinochet suspended democratic 
rule in Chile, presiding over an 
oppressive, sadistic military 
junta that completely reversed 
Allende’s socialist economic 
programs, banning unions and 
privatizing 
state 
programs 

such 
as 
social 
security. 

Moreover, his regime hunted 
down all manner of dissidents, 
imprisoning tens of thousands 
and executing thousands, with 
little to no pushback from the 
international community.

Victor Jara was an artist 

who transcended the world 
of arts and culture. He is 
remembered as both a martyr 
and hero for social activists in 
Latin America and beyond. In 
addition to being an immensely 
talented songwriter, he was 
also a university professor and 
theater director. In general, Jara 
was a symbol for progressive 
politics in the era of Pinochet, 
despite being killed before 
Pinochet’s reign. He was a 
vanguard in the Latin American 
“nuevacanción” movement and 
genre, which took influences 
from traditional folk songs but 
focused less on reinterpretation 
and more on invention of more 
modern styles.

His 1971 album El Derecho 

de Vivir en Paz is the best place 
to start with his impressive 
discography. 
Jara 
has 
the 

smooth 
ability 
to 
span 
a 

wide variety of sonic ranges. 
The first and title track is a 
meditation on the conflicts in 
Southeast Asia and a hopeful 
plea for all humans to have “the 
right to live in peace.” He takes 

a more playful tone in songs 
like “Las Casitas del Barrio 
Alto” and a more restrained one 
in songs like “Abre la Ventana.” 
While 
there’s 
nothing 

musically 
groundbreaking, 

the 
combination 
of 
Jara’s 

songwriting and clever, socially 
aware lyrics make the album an 
enjoyable listen.

Unfortunately, 
his 

championing 
of 
progressive 

causes 
through 
his 
music 

and other avenues led to his 
tragic demise at the hands of 
the Pinochet regime. By the 
time the dictator took power, 
Jara was famous throughout 
the Americas, even in the folk 

circles of the United States. 
Due to his fame and his lack 
of 
restraint 
in 
lambasting 

conservatives, he was rounded 
up — along with thousands of 
other activists and socialist 
party members — and herded 
like 
an 
animal 
into 
the 

national soccer stadium in 
the capital Santiago shortly 
after Pinochet’s coup. After 
being beaten, military guards 
smashed his fingers, cruelly 
taunting him by saying he 
would never play the guitar 
again and forcing him to sing 
for his fellow prisoners. Not 
long after, his body was found 
in a Santiago street, riddled 
with bullet holes. This year, a 
ninth soldier responsible for 
killing Jara was sentenced to 
time in prison, two years after 
a former Chilean officer living 
in Florida was found liable for 
his death.

Jara’s slaughtering by the 

hands of the Pinochet regime 
was not forgotten, and ever 
since, he has become a Chilean 
hero and a symbol worldwide 
for the continuing struggle for 
human rights and progressive 
politics. His story has been 
invoked by countless artists, 
including 
U2 
and 
Bruce 

Springsteen. 
Jara 
was 
not 

simply a political artist. He was 
not just a preacher of “peace 
and love,” but one who bravely 
put his heart and soul into 
political activism in addition 
to his music. His story, while 
tragic, is a reminder of the very 
real social impact the arts can 
have.

TV REVIEW

ALLY OWENS
Daily Arts Writer

Victor Jara was 
an artist who 

transcended the 
world of arts and 

culture


“Twenty-five 
years 
ago, 
I 

killed my mother.” It is with this 
jarring line that Sarah Zettel first 
introduces readers to the chaotic 
world of the Monroe sisters in her 
latest novel, “The Other Sister.” The 
story is told from the perspectives 
of Geraldine and Marie Monroe 
as they reconnect after years apart 
following the suspicious death of 
their mother. Geraldine believes 
she is responsible for her mother’s 
death, but the true details soon 
become clear and what actually 
happened is much more complex 
than 
the 
average 
whodunnit 

mystery.

At the start of the novel, the 

reader is kept in the dark. You know 
the sisters’ mother is dead but do not 
know how she died or who exactly 
was involved. You know Martin, 
their father, has done unspeakable 
things to his daughters but not what 
those things are. You also know 
the sisters have come together 
under the guise of celebrating the 
graduation of Marie’s son, but are 
in fact planning to do something 
terrible to Martin.

Martin is an irritating and 

pompous man who is easy to 
hate because he is an incredibly 
creepy and disgusting person. 
Much of the novel revolves around 
the relationship he has with his 
daughters and the ways he has 
abused them during both their 

childhoods and adult lives. Marie 
is seen as “the good sister” who 
is kept on a chain at the beck and 
call of Martin. While Marie’s life 
revolves around serving her father, 
Geraldine, the self-described “bad 
sister,” has spent her life trying 
to escape her deranged family. 
Although the idea of the good and 
bad sister is hammered home in the 
novel, the characters themselves 

are not so clear cut. Both sisters 
make questionable choices that lead 
to more drama and in some cases, 
death. Their controversial decisions 
make them hard to care about at 
times, but also reflect the blurred 
lines of good and bad present in all 
people.

The details of what happened the 

night of their mother’s death and 
what their father has done to push 
the sisters to the brink are revealed 
in a series of flashbacks over the 
course of the novel. However, as 
their plans for revenge against their 
father unfold and the nature of their 
mother’s death becomes clearer, the 
plot seems to drive the characters 
more than the characters drive 

the plot. The goals of the sisters 
sometimes change on a whim if 
doing so will add drama to the 
story, and they act out of character 
on more than one occasion. As the 
story progresses the sisters make 
the decision to never speak of their 
plans for their father and act as if 
nothing is going on to ensure they 
will not be found out if questioned 
by the police. Their acting makes 
sense in the context of the plot, but 
makes it difficult to determine who 
Marie and Geraldine really are and 
what they truly desire. Readers 
can never be sure when they are 
putting on a show or are actually 
saying what they mean, which 
distances them from the sisters and 
disconnects them from the story.

One of the most interesting 

aspects of the novel is the attention 
it gives to the role of women 
in classic fairytales. Geraldine 
is a lecturer on folklore at the 
university where she teaches, and 
excerpts from her fictional book 
“Fairy Tales in the Real World” are 
provided at the beginning of most 
chapters. The excerpts offer unique 
insight into the portrayal of females 
in folklore and the stories they 
inhabit, as well as how patriarchal 
influence is alarmingly present in 
the stories so many children grow 
up with.

While “The Other Sister” has 

many flaws in its characters and 
plot, its fairytale influences (as 
well as its twisted characters and 
storylines) make for an unexpected 
and entertaining read.

‘Suspiria’ is slow burning, 
but must-see nightmare

“Suspiria,” directed by Luca 

Guadagnino (“Call Me By Your 
Name”) and a remake of the 
1977 cult classic of the same 
name, revolves around Markos 
Dance 
Academy’s 
newest 

student, Susie Bannion (Dakota 
Johnson, “Bad Times at the El 
Royale”). Meanwhile, a student 
named Patricia (Chloë Grace 
Moretz, “Carrie”) flees the 
school under the conviction 
that it is the home to a coven of 
witches. 

While 
the 
narrative 
is 

unfortunately bogged down by 
a glut of story threads that do 
not come together cohesively, 
the movie provides more than 
enough 
ominous 
mysticism 

and 
excruciating 
gore 
for 

horror fans.

The deeply twisted story 

takes place in six acts and 
an epilogue, and this level 
of 
compartmentalization 

allows Guadagnino to build a 
brooding, queasy tone for the 
first few segments. Much of the 
film relies on the anticipation 
of a grand brutal payoff. When 
these payoffs arrive, often in 
the form of dance rituals, they 
are both unfathomably graphic 
and too stunning to look away 
from. 

The violence is surely not for 

everyone, but such sequences 
demonstrate 
Guadagnino’s 

powerful control over his craft 
and are confidently some of the 
most frightening of the year. 
One particular scene involving 
a training room with mirrored 
walls creates some cutting 
imagery of dancer’s anatomy 
that is hard to forget. When 
these moments occur, they 
resonate so viscerally, they do 
not quite leave one’s mind for 
the rest of the movie, or even 
after the credits roll. That 
being said, what “Suspiria” 

lacks is appropriate pacing. 
The slow burn of the film 
leaves far too much empty time 
between moments of intensity 
to get a sense of narrative 
momentum.

The reason for this lack 

of momentum is the same 
reason the film’s runtime is 
two hours and 32 minutes, 
almost an hour longer than 
the original. Guadagnino, for 
all his horror skills, can’t help 
but shoehorn into the story a 
subplot about Jozef Klemperer 
(Tilda Swinton, “The Grand 
Budapest Hotel”), an elderly 
psychotherapist searching for 
his patient. This, combined 
with frequent radio chatter 
about the various bombings in 
West Germany, weigh down 
the story and confound its 
sense of identity.

To be clear, these additions 

to the main plot were not 
nonsensical. They had clear 
roles in detailing the chaotic 
turmoil of the city around 
the academy. However, they 
ultimately proved unnecessary 
to the film’s garishly unhinged 
finale. For most of the runtime, 
Guadagnino wanted to tell 
a story that was almost too 
sweeping and expansive to 
digest. But the ending of 
“Suspiria” works as flawlessly 
as it does because of its 
simplicity. The sixth act does 
not so much convey a sharp 
message as it does an intense 
wave of emotion. But the film’s 
political backdrop, suffused 
with complex parables, was a 
misstep. 

Despite the tendency of the 

film to drag rather than remain 
unrelentingly tense, it’s an 
indelibly unsettling experience 
that fits comfortably among 
the 
best 
horror 
films 
of 

2018. 
The 
new 
directions 

that Guadagnino decided to 
take this film may not have 
all been successful, but they 
are certainly admirable. Any 
modern rendition of a revered 
film 
like 
Dario 
Argento’s 

original “Suspiria” has far too 
much to live up to. Instead of 
flailing under such pressure, 
Guadagnino resists the urge 
to copy the original and his 
intentions shown through in 
both substance and style.

In contrast to Argento’s 

nightmarish 
color 
scheme, 

Guadagnino’s set designs are 
pastel hues at their brightest. 
These shades contrast starkly 
with the stabbing blues of the 
autumn sky, and unpredictable 
cutting 
between 
shadowy 

indoors 
and 
the 
outside 

can force a viewer’s eyes to 
constantly 
adjust 
without 

ever truly stabilizing. Another 
tonal difference between the 
two is their scores. While 
Italian progressive rock band 
Goblin composed an abrasive, 
metallic soundtrack for the 
original, Radiohead frontman 
Thom Yorke tailors a slower, 
more ambient sonic texture for 
the new version. Yorke’s score, 
though certainly ambitious, 
works better in some places 
than others. In one long take 
surveying the matrons of the 
Markos Academy, his echoey 
buzzing and swingy drums 
sounded far too reminiscent 
of Radiohead and felt tonally 
inconsistent with the rest of 
the movie. However, the track 
“Unmade” elevates a scene to 
jaw-dropping effect.

If you enjoy horror movies, 

don’t miss this one. “Suspiria” 
is a mostly worthy remake 
and a paralyzingly immersive 
journey. Buy your ticket and 
brace yourself.

It’s not often that a University 

Musical Society concert becomes 
political, or that the conductor 
of an orchestra pens a program 
note 
expressing 
the 
political 

relevance of a concert being done 
overseas. The Czech Philharmonic 
Orchestra’s performance at Hill 
Auditorium this past Thursday 
night, however, was both a musical 
and political event. A celebration of 
the 100th anniversary of the Czech 
Republic’s “liberation from the 
Austrian Empire’s domination,” 
the program was a testament to 
“the courage and determination 
shown by the Czech people in the 
fight to preserve their national 
identity” as “nothing … can ever 
conquer the human spirit when it 
refuses to surrender.”

Extra musical events aside, the 

concert offered was captivating 
though admittedly inconsistent 
in its presentation of three staples 
of 
the 
repertoire: 
Dvorák’s 

“Cello Concerto in B Minor,” 
Tchaikovsky’s 
“Serenade 
for 

Strings” 
and 
Tchaikovsky’s 

“Francesca da Rimini: Symphonic 
Fantasia after Dante in E Minor.” 
It was a two-and-a-half hour 
exploration of late 19th century 
Romanticism and it demonstrated 
the triumphs and struggles of these 
composers in their contributions to 
the orchestral repertoire.

The “Cello Concerto,” the first 

piece on the program, was the 
most consistent and stunning 
performance of the night. From 
the bold opening moments of the 
first movement to the triumphant 
conclusion of the unexpectedly 
slow finale, this was a masterful 
performance by an orchestra in 
prime performance. 

The soloist Alisa Weilerstein 

played beautifully. If anything, I 

only wish she hadn’t played the 
quieter passages just as quietly 
as she did — there were a couple 
moments where it became hard 
to hear her part over that of the 
orchestra. The concertmaster’s 
solo was quite moving, as were 
the various solo passages in the 
winds and brass. The audience’s 
appreciation was palpable. They 
erupted in applause after the first 
movement and a standing ovation 
after the piece ended.

The “Serenade for Strings,” 

a string orchestra work, was 
performed with the same gusto 
if not the same precision. At its 
highest and lowest points, the work 
shined, but some of the middle 
transitional passages felt to me to 
be slightly flat. The triumphant 
ending and slow lyrical passages 
were triumphant and stunning, 
and the quiet ending to the 
third movement going into the 
fourth movement was absolutely 
breathtaking. 

Overall, however, it felt as 

though the orchestra struggled a bit 
to maintain the interpretive nuance 
they brought to the first work. It 
felt to me as though the orchestra 
got stuck in the vast middle ground 
between emulation of the notes 
in the score and interpretation 
of the work in question. While 
the performance was technically 
stellar, I didn’t experience the same 
interpretive magic as I did in the 
first work. 

The third work, the “Francesca 

da 
Rimini,” 
contained 
many 

incredibly moving moments and 
a couple of awkward, problematic 
moments. 
In 
the 
beginning, 

a couple of the entrances and 
complex rhythmic passages felt 
off. Some of the quick brass and 
woodwind gestures didn’t line up 
convincingly enough to me, and 
the opening moments of the work 
definitely felt a little jarring. As 
the work progressed, however, the 

orchestra began to unify behind 
one interpretive idea. 

The last moments of the piece 

were perhaps the most impressive 
of the night. The lower strings, 
brass and woodwinds provided a 
platform upon which the strings 
soared. And the build to this 
movement was also impressive, 
the swirling chromatic harmonies 
meandering towards many false 
cadences before bursting into a 
convincing finale. 

The 
audience 
treated 
the 

orchestra 
to 
an 
immediate 

standing ovation. After a couple 
of bows, the orchestra treated the 
audience to an encore: Dvorák’s 
“Slavonic Dance No. 2 in E minor.” 
The orchestra performed this 
encore with the ease and grace 
they had expressed at the end of 
the “Francesca da Ramini.” While 
not necessarily the most stunning 
of performances, it was impressive.

After more applause, however, 

the orchestra offered yet another 
encore: Dvorák’s “Slavonic Dance 
No. 1 in C Major.” This performance 
was also impressive but it felt a 
little overblown. The audience’s 
applause has begun to fade as the 
conductor reappeared for this 
encore and given a minute or two 
more I doubt it would have been 
appropriate. This is not to say that 
the performance had been bad, but 
after nearly two-and-a-half hours 
of music by these two composers, I 
know I had begun to wish for some 
change in repertoire or style. 

Few orchestras can sustain 

themselves on five pieces by 
extremely similar composers, and 
the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra 
proved to be no exception. As a 
testament to the work of these 
composers, however, the orchestra 
made a compelling argument for 
their inclusion in the classical 
music canon and their continued 
relevance to the orchestral music 
of today.

Wolverines
dominate Nittany Lions

The Michigan football 
team remembers the losses it 
took in 2017. They were what 
inspired the now-infamous 
“Revenge Tour” comments 
Chase Winovich made last 
month — the fifth-year senior 
defensive end said he felt tired 
of losing in either one-sided or 
agonizing fashion.
Michigan’s 42-13 defeat 
at Penn State last year was 
both. Defensive coordinator 
Don Brown said he thought 
each day about the 42 points 
the Wolverines allowed. 
Winovich and his teammates, 
meanwhile, were irked by the 
Nittany Lions’ running up of 
the score late in the game. 
So it was only fitting 
that vindication was on 

Michigan’s mind heading into 
Saturday’s battle with Penn 
State.
“If we had the chance,” 
said junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson, “we were going to 
run it up, too.”
The fifth-ranked 
Wolverines (6-0 Big Ten, 
8-1 overall) did just that, 
dispatching the fourteenth-
ranked Nittany Lions (3-3, 
6-3), 42-7, for yet another 
successful stop along 
Winovich’s “Revenge Tour”.
Michigan rushed for 259 
yards while holding Penn 
State to just 186 yards of 
total offense. Senior running 
back Karan Higdon had his 
seventh-straight contest with 
100 rushing yards or more, 
moving one game away from 
the record set by Mike Hart 
in 2007.
After a touchdown catch 

by redshirt junior tight end 
Zach Gentry made it 21-0, 
the Wolverines broke the 
game open with a pair of 
interceptions in the third 
quarter. Fifth-year senior 
cornerback Brandon Watson 
made the first, which he 
returned 62 yards for his 
second pick-six of the year.
Penn State punted on its 
ensuing possession, and 
Michigan embarked another 
run-dominant drive — capped 
off by a four-yard Higdon 
touchdown run — before 
David Long allowed the 
Wolverines to tack on their 
final exclamation point.
The junior cornerback 
intercepted quarterback 
Trace McSorely deep in 
Nittany Lion territory, 
and four plays later, junior 
running back Chris Evans 
scampered in for Michigan’s 

sixth and final touchdown of 
the evening.
“It was a really impressive 
team tonight in all phases,” 
coach Jim Harbaugh said.
Harbaugh had high praise 
for Penn State’s defensive 
line this past week, but he 
challenged it from the get-go 
with eight consecutive runs 
on Michigan’s first offensive 
series. Higdon took one of 
those carries for 50 yards, 
which put the Wolverines on 
the doorstep for Patterson’s 
second rushing touchdown of 
the season.
Following two early punts, 
McSorely, who played with 
a brace after tweaking his 
right knee last week, handed 
Michigan possession when 
he botched a handoff in the 
second quarter. Seven straight 
runs later, Patterson delivered 
a 23-yard touchdown strike 

to Donavon Peoples-Jones, 
lifting the Wolverines’ 
advantage to 14. It was 
the pair’s seventh scoring 
connection of the season.
In celebration, the 
sophomore receiver reinacted 
Saquon Barkley’s touchdown 
celebration from last year’s 
game — a flailing-armed 
sprint across the endzone.
“It was personal from the 
start,” Patterson said.
Michigan outgained the 
Nittany Lions, 210 to 77, in the 
first half and had chances to 
extend its lead to three scores. 
But a blocked field goal and 
timely sack kept Penn State 
within striking distance at the 
frame’s end.
The score was ultimately a 
mirage, however. Michigan 
continued to pummel the 
Nittany Lions in the second 
half as its defense took over. 

The Wolverines finished 
with six tackles-for-loss — 
including four first-half sacks 
— and allowed just 118 yards 
through the air.
“The most impressive 
thing to me is Don Brown,” 
Harbaugh said. “I’m 
reminded of the old jingle 
in the seventies, ‘You said 
Don Brown, you said it all.’ 
He’s the king of defensive 
coordinators.”
It was indeed a fitting 
end for both Brown and 
Winovich. With another 
lopsided win over a ranked 
opponent, Michigan feels like 
it can win its first Big Ten 
Championship since 2004.
“We’re the team to beat in 
the Big Ten,” Winovich said. 
“That’s not a controversial 
statement, it’s just, I think 
that’s a fact at this point this 
year.”

The season of grudges
A 

few weeks ago, Jim 
Harbaugh stood in front 
of his 
team after 
a course-
defining 
21-7 win at 
Michigan 
State and 
said a few 
words.
He started 
by saying it 
may have 
been his 
biggest win ever, that he had 
never had a bigger win than 
that.
Then he thanked his players.
“On a personal note,” 
Harbaugh said, “I can’t tell 
you how many guys came up 
to me and said, ‘Coach, we’ve 
got your back.’ Who are they to 
talk about you?”
He paused, seemingly tied up 
by his emotions.
Freshman quarterback 
Joe Milton, who had been 
live-streaming the post-game 
celebration from his phone, 
chimed in.
“It’s okay, coach, to cry,” he 
said, grinning.
The team broke out in 
laughter. Then they surrounded 
Harbaugh, in a visitor’s locker 
room deep in enemy territory, 
and went back to celebrating.
I thought 
about that 
moment 
throughout 
Saturday, as 
Michigan 
finished a 
three-game 
gauntlet against 
Wisconsin, 
Michigan State 
and Penn State 
by thrashing the 
Nittany Lions, 
42-7.
The Wolverines dominated 
early. They dominated late. 
They played as if they were 
pissed off.
In the second quarter, 

sophomore receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones pulled in 
a touchdown from junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson. 
Then he ran across the back 
of the endzone, windmilling 
his arms in 
celebration 
alongside his 
teammates.
It may have 
looked familiar. 
That’s because it 
was former Penn 
State running 
back Saquon 
Barkley’s 
touchdown 
celebration 
after his game-
opening touchdown in a 42-13 
win over Michigan last year.
After the game, Peoples-
Jones posted a photo of his 
celebration on Instagram after 
the game and tagged Barkley.

Barkley’s response: ‘Young 
savage.’
Later in the game, Chase 
Winovich was caught on 
camera mimicking Trace 
McSorley’s home-run-swing 
celebration. 
Patterson did 
it, too, among 
others.
After the 
game, Winovich 
said he meant 
no disrespect 
to McSorley, a 
player who he 
admires.
Then, by 
explaining 
why he and his 
teammates copied Penn State’s 
touchdown celebrations, he 
summed up what has driven 
this team all year.
“I’m just having fun. You get 
in that mood and that game 

mode,” Winovich said. “In my 
mind, it was almost like all bets 
are off. It’s fine if you want 
to laugh at running the score 
up and have a jolly old time. 
In my mind, it’s fair game, it’s 
football, it is 
what it is. But 
at the same 
time, you can’t 
get mad when 
stuff like that 
happens back at 
you.”
It goes back to 
Michigan State, 
when Michigan’s 
players backed 
up their head 
coach. It goes 
back to the ‘Revenge Tour’ 
phrase coined by Winovich and 
adopted by his teammates. It 
goes back to every single slight 
the Wolverines felt they had 
endured last fall, when they 

went 8-5. When the jokes about 
perpetually finishing third 
in the Big Ten East were at 
the height of their popularity. 
When criticism of Harbaugh 
ran rampant.
Michigan 
remembers all of 
that, and more. 
The Monday 
after the 
win against 
Michigan State, 
Harbaugh read a 
2014 quote from 
Mark Dantonio 
off a piece of 
paper pulled 
from his pocket 
as he criticized 
Michigan State’s role in a 
pregame incident between the 
two teams.
A week or so later — nearly 
a year after that 42-13 loss — 
Michigan’s players kept saying 

they remembered Nittany 
Lions head coach James 
Franklin and then-offensive 
coordinator Joe Moorhead 
laughing on the sidelines 
as they tried to score a late 
touchdown.
“I wasn’t a part of the team 
last year, but I understood 
Penn State ran up the score last 
year,” Patterson said.
“It was personal from the 
start, from the jump,” added 
senior running back Karan 
Higdon.
Pity Rutgers and Indiana, 
because the revenge tour 
didn’t end at Penn State. No, 
Michigan has displayed a deep-
seated determination to bully 
every team in the Big Ten, to 
prove what happened last year 
is simply that: the past.
The Wolverines have played 
confident football, they have 
carried themselves with 
swagger in doing so, and they 
are surely having a hell of a 
lot more fun than they were 
last fall. And now I think it is 
beyond safe to say this group 
has the look of a special team.
This is the grudge match to 
end all grudge matches, and 
so far, with the exception of a 
season-opening loss at Notre 
Dame, Harbaugh and Michigan 
have made every critic eat 
their words. They have paid 
back what they 
received last 
year. 
I’ll let Mr. 
Winovich take it 
away.
“We wanted 
our lunch 
money back, we 
wanted them to 
pay interest,” 
Winovich said. 
“The bank’s 
closed on 
Sundays, but it looks like we’ve 
got some deposits to make.”

‘M’ can’t get shutout, 
still dominates Lions

After the Michigan football 
team 
beat 
Nebraska 
earlier 
this season, members of the 
Wolverines’ defense said they 
could feel that the Cornhuskers 
didn’t want to be there.
Throughout 
the 
season, 
similar sentiments have been 
spoken by No. 5 Michigan’s 
defenders. Some offenses were 
called predictable. Others simply 
weren’t good enough to compete 
against the Wolverines.
On 
Saturday, 
following 
Michigan’s dominating, 42-7 win 
over No. 14 Penn State (6-3 overall, 
3-3 Big Ten), junior defensive end 
Josh Uche continued the trend.
“Yeah, I mean, they came 
out trying to do what they were 
doing,” Uche said. “(We) ran a 
couple stunts and their O-line 
was just so scared of us off the 
edge that they were oversetting. 
And we just gouged them inside.”
The Wolverines did gouge the 
Nittany Lions inside, and it began 
on the first drive of the game.
Penn State quarterback Trace 
McSorley found his tight end, Pat 
Freiermuth for a 25-yard gain 
on the first play. That was all the 
yardage the Nittany Lions would 
gain on the drive.
Two plays later, on 2nd-and-10, 
fifth-year senior defensive end 
Chase Winovich cut inside from 
his outside position, split through 
the Penn State offensive line and 
swallowed McSorley up for a six-
yard loss.
The next down, Uche did the 
same from the opposite side of the 
line, this time getting McSorley 
for an eight-yard loss.
“Most of their sacks this 
season came off of stunts, because 
McSorley, he’s a pretty elusive 
quarterback and he’s looking for 
those lanes,” Uche said. “He’s 
looking to run it through the 
B-gap all the time, and our pass 
rush is probably the most elite in 
the country, so I know they were 
thinking about us beating them 
off the edge. So they were more 

quick to jump out, and we just 
went inside on them.”
When all was said and done, 
Michigan dominated Penn State 
defensively.
At halftime, the Nittany Lions 
had gained just 77 total yards and 
-6 on the ground.
If you omit Penn State’s 
garbage-time touchdown drive 
late in the fourth quarter, which 
spanned 75 yards in 11 plays, the 
Nittany Lions totaled just 111 
yards.
That last drive wasn’t just 
a fluff for lackluster offensive 
stats, though. It also prevented 
the Wolverines from pitching 
a 
shutout, 
something 
they 
dearly wanted after Penn State 
killed 
Michigan 
42-13 
last 
year, attempting to a score late, 
meaningless touchdowns in the 
process.
“This 
one 
was 
definitely 
personal, knowing that they tried 
to score at the end of the game 
last year,” said fifth-year senior 
running back Karan Higdon. 
“Our defense had a stud game 
all game today, and when (Penn 
State) got that touchdown, they 
were all, you know, they were 
pissed. And that just shows you 
how personal this game really 
was.”
Added Uche: “We wanted it 
really badly. I mean, that’s the 
goal every game, but this game, 
it meant more, just because 
Coach Franklin and his offensive 
coordinator were laughing last 
year while they were tryna run 
up the score, so we really wanted 
to put an emphasis at the end of 
the game, but, you know, it is 
what it is.”
Still, even without the shutout, 
the Wolverines’ defense imposed 
their will on yet another team.
“I don’t know if other teams 
are necessarily scared of us,” 
Uche said. “I’m not gonna sit here 
and say that, but we’re not gonna 
stop, and if you don’t want to stop, 
OK, that’s fine. We can do that. 
But if you wanna stop, we can do 
that too. So we’re gonna ever let 
up.”

FOOTBALL
Wolverines assert themselves as a contender

A month ago, the Michigan 
football 
team 
approached 
the game against Wisconsin 
with everything to prove. It 
had five wins over meager 
foes. 
The 
resume-staining 
loss in South Bend on Sept. 
1 remained etched into the 
fabric of the team.
But the Wolverines told 
everyone who would listen 
that they were ready for a 
three-game stretch that they 
knew 
would 
define 
their 
season. Three games with 
the Badgers, Michigan State 
and Penn State. Three ranked 
opponents. Put up or shut up.
Three 
games 
later, 
following a 42-7 romp over 
the Nittany Lions, no one is 
doubting anymore.
“From start to finish, all 
sides of the ball, that was a 
really impressive Michigan 
football 
team 
tonight,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. “I’m really proud 
of them. Put an exclamation 
point on how proud I am.”
In 
those 
three 
matchups, 
Michigan 
outscored 
Wisconsin, 
Michigan 
State 
and 
Penn 
State 
by a margin 
of 
101-27. 
It 
outgained 
those 
three 
opponents 1,242-462. It came 
away not only with three wins, 
but three distinct statements.
And 
now, 
it 
stands 
confidently 
as 
a 
top-five 
team in the nation, raising its 
ceiling by the week.
“As you go forward, your 
baseline 
changes 
— 
your 
expectations for yourself and 
your team,” said fifth-year 
senior Chase Winovich. “Had 
we played this game week 
one, it would’ve been the most 
joyous victory. But honestly, 
in the locker room we were 
happy about the way things 

went, but we’re honestly mad 
we gave up a touchdown. 
“Your 
expectations 
change.”
Expectations. This program 
is no stranger to those. But 
Winovich wasn’t referring to 
external expectations, rather 
a 
team 
with 
growing 
self-
confidence 
by 
the week.
Going 
into 
that 
stretch 
a 
month 
ago, 
two wins likely 
would have been 
a success. And 
it’s not just that 
they came away 
with all three, 
but how. From the scuffle in 
East Lansing to the mocking 
celebrations 
Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines are talking their 
share of talk, and then backing 
up every word of it.
“A couple weeks ago, when 
we first beat Wisconsin, I 
think the Revenge Tour, we 
kind of had a bandwagon 
there,” 
Winovich 
said. 
“I 
think we’re rolling through 
these last couple games and 
eventually into Columbus like 
a battleship. I think everyone’s 
trying to hop in or hop on.”
Of course, that growing 

belief stems from on-the-field 
success. Each week, Michigan 
has shown a new layer of 
improvement. Perhaps most 
notably, the offensive line has 
grown by leaps and bounds 
under offensive line coach Ed 
Warriner.
Against 
the 
Badgers, 
the 
Wolverines 
rushed for 320 
yards. Against 
the 
Spartans’ 
top-ranked 
run 
defense, 
Michigan 
racked up 183 
yards. Saturday 
against 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 
was more of the same, rushing 
for 259. This coming just 
months after the Wolverines 
could muster just 58 yards 
against Notre Dame.
Michigan has made this leap 
without much mystery either; 
the Wolverines have run the 
ball 133 times and thrown it 
64 times over that span in a 
sign of a clear commitment to 
power football.
The pass protection has 
shown a similar ascent.
Saturday, Michigan didn’t 
give up a sack and allowed just 
two tackles-for-loss to Penn 

State — which came into the 
game leading the conference 
in both categories.
“We thought that was a 
really good defensive front 
— probably as good as Notre 
Dame’s,” Harbaugh said after 
the game. “And a team that 
really 
does 
a 
tremendous 
job 
at 
tackles 
for 
loss, 
I 
know 
they’re 
leading in that 
category. 
And 
we were able to 
stay away from 
negative 
plays, 
we were able to 
stay away from 
tackles for loss, 
we were able to stay away 
from the sacks.”
Now, barring a major upset 
at Rutgers or at home to 
Indiana, Michigan will have 
three weeks to prepare for 
its biggest game since the 
2016 loss in Columbus. In all 
likelihood, it will decide the 
Big Ten East.
Winovich, for his part, likes 
the Wolverines’ chances.
“We’re the team to beat in 
the Big Ten,” he said. “That’s 
not a controversial statement, 
it’s just, I think that’s a fact at 
this point.”

Michigan dominates Northwood in exhibition

As far as sporting events 
go, preseason exhibitions are 
amongst the most predictable. 
This one was no different.
The No. 19 Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team 
thumped 
Division 
II 
Northwood, 
90-58, on Friday night in its 
lone exhibition game before 
Tuesday’s 
opener 
against 
Norfolk 
State. 
The Wolverines 
jumped out to 
an early lead, 
hitting 
seven 
of their first 10 
field goals, and 
never 
looked 
back.
Michigan 
scored 
easily 
and efficiently, 
but 
did 
so 
without hitting 
its 
first 
3-pointer 
until 
sophomore guard Eli Brooks 
canned one in transition with 
just under two minutes left in 
the first half.
For a John Beilein-coached 
team, that’s almost unheard 
of, but it’s a trade-off Michigan 
may make. Sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole was the only 
player in Friday’s starting 
lineup who shot above 32 
percent 
from 
outside 
last 
season, a byproduct of Moritz 
Wagner, 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman and Duncan 
Robinson’s departures. Junior 
center Jon Teske did flash the 
ability to shoot from outside, 
putting in his first and only, 
3-point attempt of the night.
“We don’t have the volume 
guys we had,” Beilein said. 
“Muhammad 
was 
never 
a 
volume guy — it took him 
years to acquire that trait. 
Duncan came out of the womb 
shooting, and Moe did as 
well. None of these guys that 
we have, except Jordan Poole 
probably, had that mentality 
walking in.”

Michigan got inside with 
ease, shooting 61.7 percent 
from the field with 56 points 
in the paint, an effort led 
by freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis. The Lithuanian-
Canadian 
threw 
down 
a 
transition dunk for his first 
points and later flashed the 
ability to finish with ease, 
smoothly going to his left 
for an and-1 layup to put the 
Wolverines up 17-10.
Brazdeikis, 
who 
started 
ahead 
of 
sophomore 
Isaiah 
Livers, 
stood out with 
11 
first 
half 
points on 5-of-
6 
shooting, 
ultimately 
finishing 
with 
13, 
tied 
with 
redshirt 
junior Charles 
Matthews for the team lead. 
Poole 
and 
Livers 
stuffed 
the statsheet, as the former 
finished with 12 points, seven 
assists and five rebounds; the 
latter with 12 points and eight 
rebounds.

“We went through most of 
our preseason — Isaiah Livers 
was not able to practice a lot,” 
Beilein said. “So we got into 
a rhythm, and then all the 
sudden he was there for like 
one week beforehand. We just 
stuck with him. … Isaiah is 
a team guy and he’ll fill that 
(sixth-man) role well.”
By halftime, the outcome 
was 
all 
but 
decided, 
as 
Michigan held a 41-26 lead, 
pulling 
away 
with a 12-0 run 
punctuated by a 
transition 
dunk 
from sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole off his own 
steal 
after 
the 
Timberwolves 
tied the game at 
eight.
Early 
in 
the 
second 
half, 
the 
Wolverines 
pulled 
away 
for 
good. 
Matthews tossed a lob to 
Livers for Michigan’s first 
points of the frame, then 
threw down a dunk of his 
own less than a minute later, 
extending the lead to 45-29. 

The Wolverines rolled from 
there. Livers notched another 
transition dunk — this one 
from 
junior 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson 
— 
three 
minutes 
later, putting the margin at 22.
Defensively, 
it 
doesn’t 
seem Michigan has lost a step 
from last season, finishing 
third in KenPom’s adjusted 
efficiency. 
The 
Wolverines 
held Northwood to just .806 
points per possession, forcing 
16 
turnovers 
just 
a 
day 
after 
Beilein 
lambasted 
their 
performance 
at 
an 
open 
practice.
“We knew it 
was more like 
a game, I guess 
the situation,” 
Poole 
said. 
“How 
we 
played 
tonight, 
we 
came 
prepared to play, like ready to 
play real defense in a game.”
This was supposed to be 
a tune-up, and that’s what 
it was. On Tuesday, the real 
thing begins.

Sophomore forward Isaiah Livers threw down multiple ferocious dunks in Michigan’s exhibition win on Friday.

“None of these 

guys that we 

have... had that 

mentality.”

“How we played 

tonight, we came 

prepared to 

play.”
