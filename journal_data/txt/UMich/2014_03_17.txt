With 'Against the
Grain' as a mantra,
topics ranged from
startups to education

Over 1,000 attendees and 15
University-affiliated speakers
came together on Saturday to
share ideas and get inspired about
leadership, innovation and discov-
ery the fifth annual TEDxUofM.
"Leaders and do-ers" from
throughout the University were
selected to give 18-minute talks
on this year's theme, "Against the
Grain," as chosen by the student
event coordinators. This year's
event was held at the Power Center
on Central Campus.
"It's easy to get caught in your
own corner, and here you can
have conversations to find some-
thing that you have in common
with others in this new venue that
isn't ordinarily offered," said Art
& Design junior Annie Zisk, who

helped organize the event.
The TEDx talks were divided
into five sessions. Speakers ranged
from medical doctors striving
to improve doctor-patient rela-
tionships to students who have
founded organizations dedicated
to enhancing education in Detroit
through performance art.
For the first time, the University
TEDx event presented the TEDx-
UofM prize. LSA seniors Zoe Stahl
and Theo Schear won the $1000
prize to put towards their-urban
issues mission. The students began
a project incorporating artto make
the public aware of the now-illegal
practice of redlining in Detroit.
Redlining is the practice of using
discriminatory banking and policy
practises to enforce de facto hous-
ing segregation.
"We want to make the public
awareofthis issue," Stahl said. "A lot
of people think art can only be seen
in museums, but we want to show
that it can be relevant to social jus-
tice issues and make a statement."
The TEDx team spent months
selecting speakers from a 200-per-
son list. LSA senior Jane VanVelden,

Let the madness
begin: 'M' No. 2
in the Midwest

Michigan draws
matchup with
Wofford, difficult
region in tourney
By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS - The
Michigan men's basketball team
may not have grabbed a confer-
ence tournament championship
on Sunday, but it did secure its
highest NCAA Tournament seed
since 1993.
After falling to Michigan State
in the final of the Big Ten Tour-
nament, the Wolverines gathered
in a viewing room in Bankers Life
Fieldhouse to watch the Selec-
tion Show. There, they learned
they'd be a No. 2 seed, set to face
off against No. 15-seed Wofford,
winner of the Southern Confer-
ence, in Milwaukee Thursday.
The winner of that contest will
take on the victor of Texas vs.
Arizona State two days later.

Just over 30 minutes separat-
ed the final buzzer in the 69-55
loss and when Michigan learned
of its NCAA path.
"We snapped out of it like
that," said Michigan coach John
Beilein. "We were really down
after the game. And then all of
a sudden, hey, let's go watch the
Selection Show."
The Wolverines are in the
Midwest regional, and should
they advance from the second
and third rounds, they'd find
themselves right back in India-
napolis, and potentially against
some familiar foes.
Louisville, April nemesis of
last year, is the No. 4 seed in the
Midwest, and Duke, December
nemesis of this season, is the No.
3 seed.
"We worked hard all year,
all summer to put ourselves in
this position," said sophomore
guard Nik Stauskas. "It's fun to
look ahead and see the possible
options, but with the tourna-
ment, you never know. You can't
assume anything, so we're just

Eigth annual 'Yoni
ki Baat' explores
experiences of
women of color
ByNEALA BERKOWSKI
For the Daily
Over the snaps and laugh-
ter of an otherwise silent
crowd, students and alumni
performed monologues about
taboo topics for women of color

on Friday in Angell Hall.
Topics such as masturbation,
self-esteem, racism, abuse, sex-
uality, abortion, dating and sex
werebroughtup inboth serious
and more lighthearted ways in
the 8th annual "Yoni ki Baat,"
which translates to "Talks of
the Vagina" in Hindi.
Yoni ki Baat began when
an organization based in San
Francisco, known as the South
Asian Sisters, saw "The Vagina
Monologues" - a similar event
created to de-stigmatize wom-
en's issues - and noticed that

the show did not address the
experiences of women of color,
said LSA senior Niki Aggarwal.
Because of the apparent over-
sight, they wrote and began
performing a South Asian ver-
sion of the show known as Yoni
ki Baat with the blessing of
Eve Ensler, the author of "The
Vagina Monologues".
"A group of University of
Michigan students saw this

nia and were blown away and

Debate concerns salary disclosure
Forty years ago this week Twenty-five years ago this Ten years ago this week
(March 22,1974) week (March 22,1989) (March 17, 2004)

Regent Gerald Dunn (D-Lan-
sing) announced plans to intro-
duce a motion at the next meeting
oftheUniversity Board ofRegents
to publicly disclose of the salaries
of all University employees.
The announcement marked
Dunn's second attempt to gain
public disclosure; he introduced a
similar motion a year earlier that
failed 6-2.
Dunn told the The Michi-
gan Daily that his motivation
to reintroduce the motion was
spurred by a recent vote by East-
ern Michigan University's Board
of Regents, who voted in favor of
public salary disclosure.

The Michigan Student Assem-
bly debated a motion to condemn
four representatives for their
proposal to "de-recognize" the
United Coalition Against Racism.
The representatives submitted
this proposal following a People
of Color Conference that was
sponsored by UCAR.
The four members submitted
their proposal on the basis that
UCAR violated the MSA Com-
piled Code and All-Campus Con-
stitutionbecause certain sessions
within the conference were only
open to people of color.

The Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs, the
faculty representative body on
campus, passed a motion requir-
ing administrators to undergo
evaluations by faculty every two
to three years.
Aerospace Engineering Prof.
William Kauffman said the pur-
pose of the amendment was to
correct a lack of oversight in the
University's chain of command.
"The logic (behind the amend-
ment) was that students evaluate
the teachers, the teachers evalu-
ate students, but no one evaluates
the bosses," Kauffman said.

South Asian Progressive Alli-
ance, a former student organi-
zation, obtained the rights to
perform the show at the Univer-
sity in 2006.
This show's theme, titled "We
Kiss and Tell," sought to contest
the view of what it means to be
a lady and provide a change for
women on campus to express
themselves.
Actress Moni Ramaswamy
gave a monologue written by
University alum Aditi Hardikar,
titled "A Queer Complaint." The
performance questioned why
only gay people have to "come
out" and disputed stereotypes
about the appearance of lesbians,

among other things.
"We really wanted our show to
represent the female voices of this
campus ... and their experiences
whether they're awesome and
funny or sad and empowering,"
Aggarwal said.
Aggarwal said 13 of the mono-
logues were written by students,
which makes the event more
impactful.
"It opened my eyes to a lot of
things that women of color go
through that isn't always heard or
expressed because of the society
we live in," said LSA senior Dan
Green. "It's good to have people
that actually experienced these
things and talk about them from
their own perspective without
any other factors influencing what
they're saying."
Last semester, the group wanted
to garner monologue submissions
from across campus. To help stu-

dents with their writing, they part-
nered with the Sweetland Center
for Writing to have a workshop.
"I think this show is something
unique for the South Asian com-
munity because everyone knows
about the dance teams but this
is something different it shows
some diversity," actress Amanda
Nanyakkara, the event's head of
marketing, said. "When they hear,
'South Asian,' they think 'Indian
dance team,' they don't know
about women's experiences."
PerformingYoni kiBaatrequires
the proceeds tobe donated to orga-
nizations that help fight domestic
violence. Proceeds from this per-
formance will be donated to Mai
Family Services, a community
based non-profit that was founded
to fight against domestic violence
and mental health issues and meet
the unique needs of the South
Asian communitvof Michigan.

for today's reception I got out my

Coleman," Daniels said, as laughs
@m i c h iga n d a i ly followed from the crowd. "She was
defined as someone with expert
H,--

leadership qualities, dogged deter-
mination, and an unwillingness to
take no for an answer."
Daniels spoke of his first inter-
action with Coleman, taking place
on the set of Dumb and Dumber.
He said Coleman told him she
should play his mother in the
movie's sequel.
"Atnthatpoint, a very large secu-
rity guard came up and said, 'Jeff,
is this woman bothering you?'
Before I could say a word she said,
'I'm Mary Sue Coleman, I'm his
mother,"' he said.
Laughter filled the ballroom
and Daniels tied the joke up with a
punch: "The security guard looks
at me and says, 'Jeff, is that true?'
and I look down at this fireball
of commitment and confidence
and what looked like the eyes of
a crazy person and said, 'No, she's
not my mother, but one day she
is going to be the president of the
University of Michigan," Daniels
said. "True story."
A video followed with inter-
views by administrators, faculty,
staff and students that highlight-
ed Coleman's character and con-
tributions to the University. E.
Royster Harper, vice president for
student life, narrated the first seg-
ment of the film.
"Universities are magical plac-
es," she said. "The values and prin-
ciples thatthe students and faculty
and staff embody and try to live
out as they do their work I think is

part of the magic. Their commit-
ment to the purpose and mission
I think is part of that magic. And
in this place it has a long history
of trying to be the leader and best
when there is no path that's clear,
even when no one else is doing it.
We talk a lot about there is some
magic here. And I think Mary Sue
has been part of that magic."
Another portion of the film
showed two students recounting
their shock after learning Cole-
man was their faculty mentor.
"I was in complete shock," one
of the students said. "I was really
excited that I could get a real inter-
action with the president of the
University."
Various interviews touched
on Coleman's commitment to
engaged education, entrepreneur-
ship, issues of diversity, sustain-
ability, arts and fundraising, as
well as her visibility on campus,
arts, engagement with the staff
and accomplishments in trans-
forming the physical landscape of
the University's campus.
President Barack Obama made a
brief appearance in a clip from his
visit to campus as commencement
speaker in 2009.
Coleman's voice concluded the
video, as she spun the cube in front
of the Fleming Administration
Building.
"For today, goodbye. For tomor-
row, good luck. Forever Go Blue,"
she said.

Community service should be another option to maintain welfare benefits
epublican Gov. Rick Snyder is currently considering signing a bill
that will allow state welfare recipients to use community service
participation - in addition to other activities - to maintain
their welfare eligibility. Already suffering at the hands of a difficult
job market, allowing welfare recipients another option to extend their
welfare benefits helps alleviate the situation. Welfare programs not only
offer financial assistance, but encourage job training programs that help
welfare recipients who are unemployed to develop the necessary skills to
successfullyreentertheworkforce. Snydershouldsignthelegislationtohelp
people on welfare maintain their benefits and continue their job training.

PATRICK
MAILLET

Under the Personal Responsibility and
Work OpportunityAct of1996,most recipients
are required to work in order to receive
federal cash assistance, though factors such
as age and medical condition may excuse
certain recipients from these "work for
welfare" requirements. Michigan Senate Bill
276, approved by the state House last week,
would simply allow the act of community
service to fulfill the Department of Human
Services'work requirements.As a supplement
to Michigan's welfare-to-work program,
recipients can participate the in Partnership,
Accountability, Training and Hope program
which requires individuals seeking welfare
to participate in a three-week assessment of
their personal employment barriers and help
find some form of permanent employment.
Including community service as an
option provides an additional alternative for
recipients to maintain their welfare eligibility.
Michigan's Department of Human Services
has said the bill wouldn't force welfare
recipients to perform community service.
Instead, if welfare recipients - for whatever
reason - are unable to fulfill the other welfare
requirements, community service can serve
as a final resort to maintain eligibility.
The community service option allows
people to stay on welfare, which not only

assists them financially, but also gives
them access to services to prepare them for
the future. Currently, the state sponsors
a program called PATH. The program is
comprised of a "21-day assessment period
during which barriers to employment are
identified and caseworkers work individually
with clients to connect them with resources
to address these barriers." Thus, those on
welfare can receive state-provided assistance
in finding a job and working on their weakest
areas. Providing this will help people when
finding long-term jobs and, hopefully, help
them leave the welfare program permanently.
While this is a necessary first step, there
is a larger issue at play. Working full time
- without welfare benefits - does not
guarantee that the worker will be able to
support themselves or their families. The
minimum wage in Michigan is $7.40 per hour
and isn't tied to inflation. The living wage for
a single parent with two children is $22.34.
The difference between what individuals
need to earn and what employers actually
pay creates the need for programs like PATH
and the welfare system in general. Finding a
way to reduce this wage gap would decrease
the need for supplemental programs by
improving the wage-earning potential of
those in low-paying jobs.

the fastest pace in recorded history
and the rate is expected to continue
to rise. And do you know what our
government is doing about it? Hav-
ing a slumber party.
Last week, more than two dozen
U.S. Senate Democrats spoke
throughout the night about the
dangers of climate change and the
need for action. These Senators
each took turns bashing the GOP
and spewing facts that were
meant to "wake up" Americans.
Unfortunately, Democratic leaders
have said that a bill on climate
change won't be brought before the
floor in 2014. So what was the point
of this talkathon about climate
change? The same two motivations
for everything else in Washington:
money and theatrics.
For one of the first times in
my life, I actually agree with
Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) with regards
to this climate change all-nighter.
McConnell referred to the event as
"30 hours of excuses" perpetuated
to appease "some billionaire in
San Francisco." The man that
McConnell is referencing is Tom
Steyer, a former hedge fund
manager and environmentalist who
has pledged $100 million in the
2014 election cycle to make climate

change a top-tier election issue.
The vast majority of the
Democrats who stayed up last
week will likely get donations from
Steyer withouthavingto actually do
anything. Most Senate Democrats
who face tough reelection bids at
home stayed out of the event, such
as Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.),
Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Mark
Begich (D-Alaska) - all Democrats
from traditionally red states who
are afraid to come out in support of
the environment.
Democrats are quick to blame
the GOP for why the government
has remained virtually stagnant
with regards to climate change
over the last couple years. Though
I'm usually all for pointing fingers
at Republicans for America's trials
and tribulations, Democrats cannot
possibly argue that they have done
everythingtheycantopassanyform
of legislation that would seriously
fight climate change. Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-
Nev.) and Democratic leadership in
the Senate have stated that there is
no use in passing a climate change
bill because it will undoubtedly be
shot down by the Republican House
of Representatives. This logic
hasn't stopped the House from
voting on repealing the Affordable
Care Act 42 times. Speaker of the
House John Boehner knows that
the Democratic-controlled Senate
will never repeal President Barack
Obama's landmark legislation, yet
he still allows these repeal bills to
come to the floor because it allows
Republican candidates to go back
to their district and tout that they
have done everything in their
power to repeal the ACA.
Why doesn't the Senate take the
example from its Congressional
counterparts and at least show
concerned Americans that someone
in our government cares about

climate change? Like most things in
life, talking the talk is much easier
than walkingthe walk.
Senate Democrats are afraid of
actually taking any action against
climate change because they fear
upsetting the very businesses that
finance their campaigns. Coal,
oil and natural gas companies -
the biggest producers of carbon
emissions - give millions of
dollars every election cycle and
hire more lobbyists than almost
any other industry. There are
even some Senate Democrats who
are vehemently opposed to any
climate change legislation such
as Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) who
literally shot a copy of the Clean
Air Act nailed to a tree with a rifle
during one of his campaign ads.
Considering that West Virginia
is a major coal-producing state,
it's no wonder that most coal
companies and workers came out
and supported Manchin soon after
that ad aired.
Instead of actually taking any
action, Senate Democrats are able
to play both sides by appeasing
to the environmentalist left of
the party by making this public
spectacle while also not actually
doing anything and keeping their
donors happy.
Climate change is very real.
According to NASA, more than
97 percent of scientists agree
that human activity is very likely
causing Earth's temperature to
rise. Our government needs to stop
pandering to its powerful donors
and start worrying about the planet
that will be left for generations
to come. My message to Senate
Democrats: put aside the theatrics
and actually do something about
our warming planet.

STUDENTS ALLIED FOR FREEDOM AND-EQUALITY I
Support divestment, support human rights

This past Tuesday, members of
Students Allied for Freedom and
Equality proposed a resolution to
the Central Student Government
titled "A Resolution For the Uni-
versity of Michigan to Divest From
Socially Irresponsible Companies
that Violate Palestinian Human
Rights." The resolution calls on
the University of Michigan to re-
evaluate its financial investment
in corporations that unethically
profit from and facilitate the viola-
tion of Palestinian human rights.
The companies in question include
United Technologies, Caterpillar,
Heidelberg Cement and General
Electric. All these companies are
explicitly linked to Israel's illegal
occupation of Palestine and ongo-
ing human rights abuses.
United Technologies possesses
millions of dollars in contracts
with the Israeli Air Force for the
manufacture of armed Blackhawk
helicopters, which have been used
by the Israeli military in offensive
campaigns against Palestinian
communities, resulting in many
civilian deaths and casualties. In
addition, United Technologies
produces the engines for the F-15
and F-16 aircraft used in strikes
that result in the killing of innocent
civilians. F-15 and F-16 aircraft
were used in Operation Cast Lead in
2008/09, when 1,400 Palestinians
were killed over a three week
period, the vast majority of them
innocent civilians.
Caterpillar produces the D9 mili-
tary bulldozers that are used to ille-
gally demolish Palestinian homes.
Its bulldozers and civil engineer-
ing tools have also been crucial to
the construction of the separation
wall and settlements on Palestin-
ian land. The #UMMockEviction
campaign SAFE organized last
semester raised awareness about
the illegal demolition of Palestin-
ian homes. Since 1967, more than

27,000 Palestinian homes have
been demolished.
Heidelberg Cement is involved in
theexploitationofnaturalresources
in occupied Palestinian land for the
benefit of the Israeli construction
industry. It operates two concrete
plants and one asphalt plant in the
West Bank and has provided the
cement used for the building of
illegal settlements as well as the
building of the separation wall.
Lastly, General Electric sells
engines for a variety of Israeli
military aircraft and provides
the propulsion systems of AH-64
Apache helicopters that have been
used in terrorizing raids against
Palestinian towns and villages.
The human rights violations in
which the University is invested
are severe. Five million Palestin-
ian refugees are forcibly prevented
from returning to their homes. In the
West Bank, Palestinians live under a
military occupation, in Gaza they are
under constant siege and Palestinian
citizens of Israel are explicitly denied
equal rights under the law. Israel
arbitrarily and punitively destroys
Palestinian homesand farms, impris-
ons and tortures Palestinian children
and has killed thousands of Palestin-
ian civilians since the year 2000.
Investing in companies that profit
from military occupation and vio-
lence, no matter where or why, is
wrong. And with thousands of via-
ble alternatives, it is not necessary.
In asking for the divestment from
companies that continue to cooper-
ate with the violation of Palestinian
human rights, we are merely hold-
ing our University accountable to its
stated moral and ethical standards.
The President's Advisory Commit-
tee on Labor Standards and Human
Rights at the University of Michi-
gan states that its role is to "moni-
tor code enforcement and promote
University leadership in corporate
citizenship with respect to fair labor

practices, human rights and sustain-
ability in its licensing operations."
The University has reflected its
commitment to ethical practices
and human rights in its corporate
investments in the past, when stu-
dent pressure led to divestment
from apartheid South Africa in 1978
and from tobacco-related companies
in 2000. By calling attention to this
issue, we are continuing the spirit of
the thousands of University student
activists who have been and contin-
ue to be committed to social justice
and equality for all people - not just
those whodemanded divestment
from apart-heid South Africa, but
also the courageous students that
vocally opposed the Vietnam War,
that pried open the doors of higher
education to people of color and
those that continue to fight for equal
access to higher education.
Instead of being cause for contro-
versy, the respect for human rights
should be a commonly acknowl-
edged principle. When the student
representatives vote next Tuesday
on the resolution, they will face a
simple choice: whether to stand
in solidarity with Palestinians'
non-violent resistance to occupa-
tion and violence, or to remain as
accomplices in human rights viola-
tions and indigenous displacement.
The voting for the resolution will
take place tomorrow, March 18 at
7:30 p.m. in the Chambers room of
the Michigan Union. Please join
us if you would like to show your
support and stand in solidarity.
Additionally, Ali Abunimah, the
founder of Electronic Intifada, will
be speaking about his latest book
The Battle for Justice in Palestine
and the future of Palestine and
Israel March 17 at 7 p.m. in the
Rackham Amphitheater.
This viewpoint was written by
the members of Students Allied
for Freedom and Equality.

Wofford assistant coach Darris
Nichols happens to be a former
player under Beilein at West Vir-

"(He) is one of the smartest,
brightest point guards I have ever
had," Beilein said. "I wish he real-
ly didn't understand our offense
at all. But he knows everything
about it, so we have a challenge
with a guy on the other bench
knowing everything we are going
to do."
To hear Michigan talk about
it, the team could hardly be both-
ered by its NCAA Tournament
seed.
"People talk about one, two,
three, four seed," Beilein said.
"None of us coaches really care
about that. Or at least this coach
doesn't."
Added Stauskas: "That wasn't
really mentioned at all. We want-
ed to win this tournament. We

presented their ideas to the pub-
lit at Friday's event..
Out of the five finalist teams,
three winning teams were cho-
sen as the standouts, with one
winning team from each of the
three competition categories.
Each winning team received a
$2500 prize, and the grand prize
winner had the opportunity to
pitch their idea at the TEDx-
UofM conference Saturday.
Enliven, winner of b6th the
grand prize and the Detecting

egory, is a cell phone applica-
tion aimed to decrease anxiety
and depression in young adult
women by promoting self-

"The point of the app is to
work on individual character
strengths-kindness, selfless-
ness, vulnerability, self-accep-
tance," said Nursing graduate
student Meaghan Cotter, a proj-
ect member. "You work on them
by doing what we call 'Daily-
Do's,' which can be anything
from a self-reflection to a pay it

possibly get a one seed. But we
weren't too concerned about that.
We're happy with a two seed."
The only other time the Wol-
verines were tabbed as a two-
seed, they were upset in the
second round by No. 7-seed towa
State in 1986. That game was also
played in the middle of Big Ten
country, in Minneapolis.
"The NCAA has been so good
this past couple years of finding
teams and getting them close to
home without putting them in
their home arena," Beilein said.
"So it's really good. We have great
fans all through the footprint of
the Big Ten. Particularly in that
area, the Chicago area, we will
really draw well."
It'sthe25thtournamentappear-
ance in school history, and it's the
fourth time the school has been a
two-seed or better. The Wolver-
ines are 7-4 overall in the Midwest
region and 15-3 overall in their
opening March Madness matchup.
The top seed in the region is Wich-
ita State, the only undefeated team
in college basketball.
Maybe it was that Michigan
had just lost to its rival Michi-
gan State, or maybe the team has
recalibrated to a new normal, but

Ileisha Sanders said her expe-

taught her important lessons in

"It really makes you think
about sustainability, and you
can use entrepreneurship to do
that," Sanders said. "That's not,
so typical of what public health
does."
The winner in the Technol-

"I don't know if it's that much
excitement," said fifth-year senior
center Jordan Morgan. "It's not
like we didn't expect to be in the

That speaks to the direction of
the program, because Beilein cer-
tainly remembers different in his
coaching career.
"I've been in that room when
you lost the (conference) cham-
pionship and you weren't going
anywhere," he said. "Or maybe
the NIT. This is huge to walk from
that room and go see us in the
NCAA Tournament. It's terrific."
Morgan is the only one on the
team to have experienced a sea-
son that Michigan failed to reach
the NCAA Tournament, but for
the rest of the team, that concept
seems foreign.
"With the tradition in this
program, you start to expect that
you're going to be in the tourna-
ment," Stauskas said. "It doesn't
mean we're gonna take this for
granted. But all year the tourna-

found that they have wonderful

take those early ideas and create

even beyond that, create prod-

The presentation featured
nationally renowned poetic
voice Sekou Andrews. Through
his pieces on the growing rela-
tionship between public health
and technology, he elicited
laughs and a standing ovation
from the audience. As a former
fifth grade teacher, Andrews
said he maintains a commitment
to education.
"When a school calls, I tend
to come," Andrews said. "It was
an opportunity to inspire on a
topic that I care about - innova-
tions in health."
Andrews said one message
of his poems was for people to
embrace change.
"Technology is causing the
world to move faster and faster,"
Andrews said. "Those who can
keep up are going to be success-
ful whether it's in entrepreneur-
ial endeavors, whether it's in
healthcare endeavors, whether
it's in capital endeavors."

Life is good brand comes
to Ann Arbor in new shop

Clothing brand
opens store on
Main Street
By CHRISTY SONG
Daily StaffReporter
Optimists rejoice.
Life is good has opened its lat-
est retail location in Ann Arbor.
The store opened its doors
March 9 and hosted its grand
opening Saturday and Sunday,
which featured Michigan-relat-
ed Life is good gear, free give-
aways and a 20 percent discount
off of a purchase of $50 or more.
The retail store took the place
of Seyfried Jewelers, located at
304 S. Main Street, after six and
a half weeks of renovation.
The store occupies 1,000
square feet and features Life
is good products from T-shirts
to shorts to water bottles. The
Black Pearl, the next door sea-

food and martini bar, will use the
back roomofthe store for private
events.
Store owner Mark Messmore,
a School of Education alum, said
that he decided to open the shop
because the brand is well suited
for Ann Arbor shoppers.
Life is good is noted for its
grinning mascot, Jake. Mess-
more said the brand was tradi-
tionally a resort-town mainstay.
The company is based in Mas-
sachusetts and has 4,500 retail
stores nationwide, all privately
owned.
"They are sort of turning the
brand in a new direction and it's
more toward college campuses,
toward the younger professional
look," Messmore said. "It still
caters to the outdoor activist
type person. It's the right kind of
mix and it goes really well with
the Ann Arbor crowd."
Messmore said Main Street
is an ideal location for the store
due to the foot traffic in the

area. When guests are waiting
for their reservations at nearby
restaurants, Messmore said he
anticipates they will peruse local
shops like his own in the mean-
time.
Messmore does not anticipate
competition from nearby stores
like Moosejaw. He said Life is
good products are unique and
complimentarytotheir products.
Messmore said his ultimate
goal isto provide a personal, gen-
eral neighborhood shop where
customers can get the full Life is
good experience.
"I think as this brand grows
and repositions itself to maintain
its loyalty to tried and true but
also turn to a younger crowd,"
Messmore said. "This store is a
pivot point for the brand and I
think that it will lend itself really
well to the people here."
Regular store hours are10 a.m.
to 8 p.m. from Sunday through
Thursday and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
from on Fridays and Saturdays.

Rescue workers continue
clean-up work from blast

Cause of deadly
NYC explosion still
undetermined
NEW YORK (AP) - Emer-
gency workers sifted through
debris Saturday from the site of
a deadly explosion at two New
York City apartment buildings
as they worked to clear the way
for investigators to search for
clues that might reveal what
caused the blast.
Fire Commissioner Salva-
tore Cassano said rescue work-
ers reached the rear of the
basement Saturday but said
that investigation of the pip-
ing and meters in the front of
the basement that will help
explain what caused the blast
that killed eight people will
likely start on Sunday.
He said that the National
Transportation Safety Board
should be able to start pres-

sure-testing the pipes Sunday.
. Arson detectives and fire
marshals have been waiting to
enter the basements to exam-
ine meters, check pipes and
inspect any possible ignition
sources, such as light switches,
that might have caused the
blast.
The theory that the explo-
sion was due to a gas leak
gained momentum Friday after
the NTSB, which investigates
pipeline accidents, said under-
ground tests conducted in the
hours after the explosion reg-
istered high concentrations
of natural gas. The NTSB will
conduct its own inquiry after
police and fire officials deter-
mine what might have caused
the blast.
Cassano said about 15 per-
cent of the debris was left on
the site late Saturday after-
noon.
An uplifting moment from
the painstaking recovery effort

came as crews pulled a large
water-damaged Bible from the
rubble of the Spanish Christian
Church, which was located in
one of the two destroyed build-
ings. About two dozen people,
including clergy members, car-
ried the Bible in a solemn pro-
cession near the East Harlem
site.
"This was in the depths of
the rubble. Somehow God pro-
tected it," said Rick del Rio, a
bishop at the Church of God.
The church's pastor, Thom-
as Perez, suffered heart palpi-
tations when he saw the Bible,
said Letitia James, the city's
public advocate. He was taken
by ambulance to a hospital as a
precaution, supporters said.
Cassano said Perez was
overwhelmed with emotion.
"It was singed but it meant
an awful lot to the pastor," he
said. "It showed the pastor that
they'll be rebuilding."

"I don't even need speed."
'Speed' needs more

Waugh brings
famous video game
to silver screen
ByMAYANKMATHUR
Daily Arts Writer.
Movies like Scott Waugh's
"Need for Speed" are supposed to
be pretty standard; they usually
come with fast
cars, unrealistic )
but enjoyable
stunts, larger Need for
than life heroes, Speed
annoying antag-
onists, sexy girls Rave 20 and
and good music. Quality 16
Let's call this
the "Fast and Disney
Furious" prec-
edent. It's a rea-
sonable template for a movie about
male machismo that is driven from
behind the wheel through stereo-
typical motives like vengeance. of
course,there's nothingwrongwith
that. You probably know how the
movie is going to play out before
you start watching it - there aren't
going to be any major surprises,
but that's okay - allyou're looking
for is decent entertainment.
Unfortunately, by spectacularly
missing the mark on the aforemen-
tioned criteria, "Need for Speed"
doesn't even come close to being
as enjoyable as it tries to be. It's
not like it attempts to create a new
trend and revamp this particu-
lar subset of the action genre - it
actually tries to replicate aspects
of other successful movies and

fails miserably. How bad can a
movie about fast cars and revenge
get? Watch this one to find out.
Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul,
"Breaking Bad") is a former race
car driver who works in a garage
that he owns. Marshall is a little
behind on finances, so he partici-
pateswithhisfellowmechanicbros
in nighttime races that take place
in the city to help keep his busi-
ness afloat. One day, before a race,
his longtime rival Dino (Dominic
Cooper, "Dead Man Down") shows
up and offers Marshall the chance
to work on a Shelby Mustang in
exchange for 25 percent of the
car's estimated value of $2 million.
Strapped for cash, Marshall has no
choice but to help his enemy out. In
a very rapid turn of events, a mem-
ber of Marshall's entourage dies
due to Dino's deception and trick-
ery, and Marshall is put behind bars
for involuntary manslaughter due
to the lack of evidence incriminat-
ing Dino - cue feelings of guilt and
anger and the need for revenge.
Two years later, Marshall is
freed and hell-bent on getting
Dino back for his crimes. He must
now journey all the way from New
York to San Francisco in 45 hours
to compete against Dino in De
Leon - a race organized by the
local DJ Monarch, played by a very
annoying Michael Keaton ("Ray-
mond Sellers").
The bulk of the movie is spent
focusing on this little road trip,
and the representation of the ini-
tial conflict and final resolution is
so rapid that you're left wondering
what the big deal was in the first
place. The film is filled with innu-

merable holes, and logic is such a
forgotten concept that the slight-
est evidence of common sense
brings tears of joy. At one point, for
instance, Dino is let off the hook
because of the lack of evidence
against him, despite the fact that
he deliberately crashes into Mar-
shall's buddy's car in the middle of
a bridge on a New York highway.
Apparently no one was around to
see it happen. All Dino had to do
was make the car he drove disap-
pear, and he's effectively made
bystanders on the bridge blind to
whatever happened.
One could forgive the redun-
dancy of the plot if it weren't for
the terrible performances. All the
characters in the movie are annoy-
ing - there's not a single likeable
one. Each comes with their intol-
erable quirks that are so unbear-
able that it was a relief to see one of
them get picked off. The chemistry
between the actors is so poor that
it's awkward to watch. The banter
is just plain weird, the only sounds
of laughter came from the screen
itself. Even the classic redeeming
quality of such a film - the action
set-pieces -are so over the top and
poorly executed. There is simply
no savinggrace.
In short, "Need for Speed" is in
need of a lot of other things, such
as a good script, good performanc-
es and enjoyable action set-pieces
in order to pull it up to the level
of a mediocre popcorn flick. This
movie makes a mockery of itself
through its clumsy handling and
poor execution and is capable of
leaving viewers with the lowest
of expectations disappointed.

was supposed to write
about the Oscars last
week. I was supposed to
be outraged - no,pissed - about
the fact that most Academy
voters, reflective of a notable
majority in
Hollywood,
are typi-
cally white
males. So
supposedly,
it shouldn't
really come
as a sur- AKSHAY
prise why SETH
it's taken so
long for a
movie like "12 Years a Slave"
to get made, and then go on
to receive the type of atten-
tion it's finally getting. I was
supposed to run through the
streets of Ann Arbor, tossing
my groundbreaking words into
the outstretched ears of the
people who would then join
me, forming our parade - a
parade that would expand into
the outstretched arms of L.A.
But then, I thought about
Ellen'sselfie.Ithought about life.
And I realized that these
thousand-something words
I'm about to write, like any
other column published under
my name, are just the Micro-
soft Word version of a self-
ie I take every other week.
Ellen's selfie broke ground
(and Twitter) because it wasn't
just about her. It featured Hol-
lywood's best and brightest
awkwardly trying to squeeze
into an arbitrary frame as they
peered at a smartphone cam-
era lens, resulting in a collage-
format tribute to the most
beat-down aspects of celebrity
culture known to man. So for
this column aka my response
selfie, I'm going to set my own
frame, and into that frame, I'll
shepherd in the most bankable,
honest collage-representation
of us, the common people.
I'm going to talk about
YouTube comments. You-
Tube comments respond-
ing to trailers for some of
the Best Picture candidates.
Her
kutkuknight: Why dont they
make more of this inovative stuff
in stories?Im tired ofthe same old
romances, this is something new
and refreshing, i already think i
will cry when i see the movie ;_;
Kutkuk, I agree that this was
one of the most innovative mov-
ies released in recent years. If
I had to be honest, though, I
wasn't expecting any less from
Spike Jonze, who, over the last
decade, has established himself
as one of the most progressive,
thoughtful writer-directors
working in Hollywood. Need
proof? The obvious example
is "Being John Malkovich," a
1999 classic about a master pup-
peteer who discovers a super-
natural mind-control portal
into the head of the eponymous
actor. Another thing to note
about "Her," of course, is that
Jonze wrote it without help
from Charlie Kaufman, his
usual screenplay partner, and
it's his first solo-writing credit.
I hope you don't cry when you
see the film, but if you really
are touched by it, I recommend
watching "Lars and the Real

Girl" afterward, a film about a
socially awkward weirdo who
falls in love with an inanimate

sex-doll (redundancy much?). to be able to distance ourselves
It's not a perfect companion- from the subject matter at hand
piece to "Her," but if viewed in in order to realize how unreal-
tandem, the two films become istic it would've been if Bullock
a heart-warming testament spent the entire film talking
to the merits of opening one- to herself. Worse, still, would

American Hustle Nailed it.

JENNsquarepants: wth
worst trailer ever i know
nothing of this movie
It's interesting you bring up
this point, Jenn, because so
many of the trailers for other
best picture nominees this
year have received criticism
for giving away too much plot
in order to hook audiences.
Personally, I think it's disap-
pointing that the film industry,
as a whole, has started to move
away from visceral, instinc-
tual trailers that don't divulge
too much story for the movies
they're supposed to be adver-
tising. Don't you think there's
a magical anticipation in walk-
ing into the theater, eyes twin-
kling, waiting to be surprised by
a film? Having a predetermined
idea of what cinema is supposed
to be about detracts from the
viewing experience because one
of the most important aspects
of film, just like any other art
form, is the initial, intuitive
reaction that comes moments
after looking at the screen.
In any case, the issue with
"American Hustle," is that the
plot is simply too dense, too
confusing to pack into two min-
utes convincingly. So yeah, you
don't walk away knowing too
much about the film, but the fun
is in the hairstyles, the music,
the grooviness of the '70s.
Sharp: When I see "Ameri-
can" in the title I just leave.
I'm sad you feel this way,
Sharp. Though I can kind of see
where you're coming from -
America isn't exactly killin' it
in terms of public opinion right
now - I still think you should
give this film a fair shot before
jumping to conclusions. In all
honesty, the idea of "American-
ness" isn't even a driving or
recurring motif in the film. It's
more about the whole notion
of fooling/conning ourselves
into the perception of success,
and at the end of the day, that
can be a pretty global theme. I
guess what I'm trying to say is
you can't always judge a book
by its cover. This movie would
be equally worthwhile if it
were called "Pakistani Hus-
tle" or "Norwegian Hustle" or,
dare I say, "Canadian Hustle."
Gravity
Mindshi fter: so this trailer is
about Sandra orgasmic sounds?
I know you're trying to be
funny, Mindshi, but this is the
kind of talk that really gives
YouTube a bad name. No, San-
dra Bullock didn't pull off a Cate
Blanchette-esque performance
in this movie. No, Sandra Bull-
ock shouldn'thave won an Oscar
for "The Blind Side." And yes,
most of the script direction for
"Gravity" was just various iter-
ations of "[groan loudly here]."
But at the same time, we have

The Wolf ofWall Street
Ace H681: A very mislead-
ing trailer this shoud be an
x-rated it's a piece of shit full
of sex drugs and blasphemy
A lot of people were angered
by how far Martin Scorsese went
in his raw, unrestrained depic-
tion of the excesses of Wall Street.
I wasn't one of those people,
and the reason why is simple:
The goal of this film was never
to glorify Jordan Belfort's waste-
ful addiction to drugs and money.
Rather, Scorsese tried to expose
the evils of unnecessary extrava-
gance by forcing his audience to
see just how warped our percep-
tion of reality can become with
enough overindulgence.'For evi-
dence, look no further than the
film's' heart-wrenching climax,
whereBelfort physically assaults
his wife under the influence of
cocaine and unwilling to face the
inevitability of going to prison.
Nanda Rizky Nurhuda: But
still, no oscarfor leo. He deserve it!
Alright, alright, alright. You're
right, you're right, you're right.
Maybe next year? Maybe next
year? Maybe next year? Probably
not, probably not, probably not.
12 Years a Slave
Paris Arnett: I dare a white
man to come up to me now I
have no more patient for them
I think a lot of people walked
away from this film feeling
angry at white people - in
some weird cases, other white
people. I'm not here to say
white people haven't benefited
at the hands of an establish-
ment shaped by systemic rac-
ism, but the thing to take from
this movie is the importance
of us, as a nation, being able
to face history without let-
ting it leak into the present.
Try not to get mad at the
white people. They feel really
guilty. Instead, save your rage.
Get mad at the white people who
won't go see the film because
"it's really uncomfortable."
Brad Patin: I don't feel
guilty about slavery. I don't
remember owning any slaves
It would be really weird if you
did own slaves and just forgot,
but that's not the point I'm try-
ing to make here. No, you didn't
own any slaves in this lifetime,
but, Patin, you have to acknowl-
edge the fact that you've bene-
fited from the slave trade simply
by being white. Most African
Americans have ancestors that
were, at some point in history,
sold into slavery. You can't say
that about most Caucasians,
and based just on that truth, it's
pretty obvious why you have to
concede an imbalance exists.
No one cares if you feel guilty.
Just don't be idiotic enough to
forget slavery did, in fact, ben-
efit you in some indirect ways.

There's no recreating 'Vermeer'

By ZAK WITUS
For the Daily
For non-painters and non-art
historians like me, the title of this
documentary, "Tim's Vermeer,"
is at first a total
mystery. WhatA
is a "vermeer,"
what is a "Tim" Tim's
and what does Vermeer
it mean that a
Tim possesses Michigan
a vermeer? Art Theater
people, on the
other hand, will Sony Pictures
recognize the
name Vermeer as that of Johannes
Vermeer, the 17th century Dutch
painter famous for painting pho-
to-realistically hundreds of years
before the invention of the cam-
era. But the secret that art igno-
ramuses and experts alike won't
know - unless they've seen the
film of course - is that the titular
Tim has recreated Vermeer's "The
Music Lesson." And the product is
pretty incredible, considering that
it's almost indistinguishable from
the original and that Tim has
zero painting experience.
The mystery of Tim's journey
is the incredible realism of
Vermeer's painting: How the
fuck did he paint so life-like?
That's the question artists
and art historians have been
asking for centuries. Initially, I
confess, I wasn't very interested
in this question because I'm
mostly paint-ignorant and
have little appreciation for
painting techniques. But, as
the film progressed and I saw
the extraordinary lengths Tim
went to in order to recreate
"The Music Lesson" (e.g. flights
to Europe to meet with artists
and Vermeer experts; taking
hundreds, maybe thousands of
hours off work; learning Dutch;
learning to make paint from
pigments and oil; recreating a
life-size set of Vermeer's subject
scene, spending roughly half-a-

SONY PICTUREs

year painting, etc.), the grandeur
of Tim's project captivated me.
The film's buzz is in Tim's
practicality: He really did all the
crazy shit we're seeing him do in
order to create a Vermeer with
zero painting experience. By far
his most remarkable achieve-
ment is his discovery of how
Vermeer painted so photo-real-
istically. Well, maybe it's a dis-
covery. No one can be sure how
Vermeer did what he did, but Tim
and the artists he meets with on
camera seem convinced that
Tim had found Vermeer's secret.
I won't reveal Tim (and maybe
Vermeer's) method here, but suf-
fice it to say that Tim's harnessed
his skills as an inventor and tech
guy to substitute for his total lack
of painting experience.
So, although Tim's demon-
strated pragmatism generates
the film's biggest buzz, the film
also poses and responds to some
interesting philosophical ques-
tions: What is an artist? What is
an inventor? And, most impor-
tantly, can a person be both
simultaneously? Though the
viewer is free to answer for him-
self or herself, the filmmakers
directly argue that yes, a person
can be an artist and an inventor
simultaneously. There's no doubt
Tim invents his way around for-
mally learning how to paint. But

the filmmakers say that doesn't
disqualify him as an artist. Art
and technology have always
been deeply interconnected,
they argue, and, furthermore,
Vermeer probably used a similar
technology-based paintingmeth-
od - if not the same method. So,
following this line of thought, if
we would disqualify Tim as an
artist because he is also a tech-
nologist, then we would also be
disqualifying Vermeer as an art-
ist as well. No one inthe art com-
munity would want to end the
argument with that conclusion,
so they will no doubt have some
objections.
Painters, you will probably
enjoy this film even more that I
did - like the group of people,
apparently painters, who sat in
front of me in the theatre and
laughed at inside painterly jokes
that I didn'tget. Creative drudges
like me, you will probably enjoy
this film too. If you do not experi-
ence perpetual astonishment and
awe with Tim's project - if not
in its artistry, then in its technol-
ogy - I would question whether
or not you are a sentient human
being at all. Only a totally cal-
lous, aesthetically dim-witted
Neanderthal could not find at
least something beautiful and
lovely in Tim's project and, by
proxy, "Tim's Vermeer."

'M' refocuses
on matchup
with Wofford

Wolverines
fall to MSU
n BIG final

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS - Nov. 17,
the Michigan men's basketball
team walked off the court
in Ames, Iowa while Iowa
State fans rushed onto it.
The Cyclones had just upset
the then-seventh-ranked
Wolverines and launched them
into their toughest stretch of the
season.
In the following 28 days,
Michigan lost three more times
- against Charlotte in the
Puerto Rico Tip-Off, on the road
at Duke and at home to then-No.
1 Arizona. The Wolverines fell
from the rankings and from the
forefront of people's attention.
Instead, in-state rival
Michigan State dominated
headlines. During Michigan's
four losses in that span, the
Spartans jumped to No. 1 in the
polls and stayed there for three
weeks. They were the team
people predicted to celebrate a
conference title come March.
The Wolverines didn't like
that narrative. So they stopped

losing. After dropping a two-
point contest to the Wildcats in
mid-December, they went on to
win 10 straight games, including
a defining victory in Madison
against then-No. 3 Wisconsin
team.
Sunday, like the Sunday
afternoon in Ames, Michigan
again watched as its opponent
celebrated on the court. This
time, it was the Spartans
following their Big Ten
Tournament championship win.
After advancing to the
final for the first time since
1998 - though that year is
not officially recognized due
to NCAA sanctions - the
Wolverines had an opportunity
to win the tournament after
already claiming the outright
conference title. But a strong
Michigan State team stymied
them and rolled to a 69-55 win.
The Spartans walked away
with the hardware, but that was
supposed to happen. It wasn't
supposed to be in a competitive
contest against the Wolverines.
That wasn't the preseason

INDIANAPOLIS - When the
Michigan men's basketball team

the losswas
discounted MICHIGAN 55
because MICHIGAN ST. 69
Michigan
State played without starters
Adreian Payne and Branden
Dawson.
When the Wolverines won
again, this time in Ann Arbor in

February, an exhausted Payne
played while Dawson was still
out.
It wasn't surprising then,
when, in a Big Ten Championship
battle of wills, Michigan State
- with a healthy Payne and
Dawson in tow - simply wanted
it more. The Spartans halted
a three-game losing streak to
their in-state rivals to win the
conference tournament, 69-55.

they could be with us," said

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com.

With a smie, Ulehia builds a new program

J ennifer Ulehla is smiling
as she walks up and down
the post-game handshake
line to pat her players on the
back. She's more bubblythan
expected, chomping on a piece
of gum like it somehow holds the
secrets to buildinga program
from scratch.
Ulehla, the
head coach
of the first-
year women's
lacrosse
team, just
played wit-
ness to a beat
down on her
home field. EVERETT
Northwest- COOK
ern - which
has won
seven of the last nine national
championships - scored 50 sec-
onds into the game. The Wolver-
ines were down by 10 less than
eight minutes into the contest.
The final score was 20-6, but
realistically, the Wildcats prob-
ably could have scored 40 if they
really wanted to.
The game against No. 8
Northwestern was Michigan's
fifth of the season. After a loss
to No. 14 Johns Hopkins on
Sunday, the Wolverines have
lost their first six games by a
combined score of 107-39.
And yet, Ulehla stands in that
line smiling, still, even after
handshakes and quick speech
to her young team, even after
a look over the box score and
interviews with the media.
The smile remains bdcause it
has to. This is Michigan's first
season, and the team is made up
entirely of freshmen. No exist-
ing culture for young recruits to
learn from. No upperclassmen
to give guidance about classes,
social life or other issues that
are outside of Ulehla's realm.
Not even enough depth to play
the style of defense that will
eventually be implemented.

The smile sticks because
at this point, everything is a
learning process and the game
results aren't all that important.
So, while it's not fun now, losing
isn't necessarily the worst thing
that could happen to this team.
"It's hard to say that this
year isn't about wins and losses,
because we are all competitive
and want to win, but ultimately,
it's about us building that foun-
dation to get better and playing
teams like (Northwestern),"
Ulehla said. "They are learn-
ing so much, and now we're in
season and playing these top
programs, and today, I was just
thrilled, because for me it was
like a great practice. You can't
simulate that."
It helps that Ulehla has expe-
rience with inaugural programs
- she was hired on at Michigan
after a stint as an assistant
coach at Florida, which started
its program in 2010. She's been
in charge of the program in Ann
Arbor since August 2011, and
since then, not much has caught
her by surprise.
The one thing that has
caught her off-guard, though,
is how hard it is to build lead-
ership and a winning culture
from scratch.
Ulehla appointed five Wol-
verines to her leadership coun-
cil to combat
some of these_
issues and has
brought in ,i twill
mentors from l
other athletic andi
programs to
help ease the be M i
transition.
Like every- wor
thing else in
the program, it
isn't easy now,
but the goal is that it will be in a
few years.
"When you have leadership
from up above down, some-
one just comes in, learns how

Michigan women's lacrosse coach Jennifer Ulehla has remained patient early in the season despite her team being outscored107-39 in its first six games.

to do it by following," Ulehla
said. "You've got leaders, and
the leaders have to make good
decisions if they are good. They
have to make difficult calls and
have difficult conversations.
That's a lot
for an 18 year
old to take
happen, on, especially
h e when we are
it will trying to
build a top
chigan program and
expectations
thy." are high. I
have to always
step back and
remind myself
of that, because it becomes
frustrating."
The other reason Ulehla
isn't as concerned with wins
and losses is because she didn't

pad this year's schedule. In the
game before Northwestern, the
Wolverines played the fifth-
ranked Gators. In the game
after Northwestern, Michigan
traveled to Maryland to play
Johns Hopkins.
All three of those games were
beyond blowouts, which ina
way, is kind of the point.
"I could have padded our
schedule, but that doesn't get us
to where we want to be," Ulehla
said. "It makes for a tough first
year, butI focus them on the
positives of the future. What we
do this year, is going to propel
us next year, and ultimately to
when these guys are juniors."
Ulehla has a tendency to
speak in absolutes, so it's not "If
we win the Big Ten," it's "When
we win the Big Ten." The goal is
for the Wolverines to compete

by the time this current class
of freshman are juniors. Ulehla
estimates that as the word about
Michigan and its head coach get
out there, her recruiting classes
only get better over the next
three years.
Eventually, everything else
will come with wins. The game
against Northwestern was
marketed as a "Maize Out," so
the first 250 fans in attendance
received free maize shirts with
"Team One" inscribed on it. By
the end of the game, there were
plenty of shirts to be had. It's
going to be a process, but as the
team gets better and the culture
gets set, the fans will come.
"These kind of games,
although really tough in the
moment because we're incredi-
bly competitive, you have to step
back and recognize what we're

going to build here." Ulehla said.
"My administrators remind me
this isn't a sprint, it's a mara-
thon. To me, maybe a marathon
is maybe a little too long, I'm
going to just go on a run, but it
takes time to build it the right
way. But it will happen, and it
will be Michigan worthy."
Right now, it's just a coach
and 27 freshmen tryingto start
something from nothing. As she
leaves, Ulehla looks back over the
field and yells to the one remain-
ing person in the building, "Baby
steps, right? Baby steps."
Ulehla hits the cold Ann
Arbor air with a smile. In the
moment its unpleasant, but
she's excited for what's to come.

'M' takes 33rd at NCAAs

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
Maya Long had been to the
NCAA Indoor Track and Field
Championships before - in fact,
the sophomore was the only
repeat member of the Michigan
contingent.
But before she even received
the baton to start her leg of the
distance medley relay, she knew
this time would be different.
The defending national
champions in the relay finished
fifth to head the Wolverines'
33rd-place effort at the indoor
championships in Albuquerque,
N.M. Sophomore Cindy Ofili
added three points with a fifth-
place finish in the 60-meter
hurdles as Michigan tied with
Akron with seven points.
Last season, Long was a
freshman on a distance medley
team that consisted of two
seniors and a junior. That team
finished the final race in 11:14,
a second and a half ahead of
second-place Villanova.
This time, Long - who runs
a 400-yard dash for the second
leg - was surprised.
"There was so much traffic
getting the baton, everyone
came in pretty close," Long said.
"It was a lot different from last
year, when we were getting the
baton and not having to worry
aboutany collisions or anything.
(Freshman Jaimie Phelan) came
in with a big group of girls, and
it was hard to see."
The first time Long tried
to grab the baton, she missed.
Then, she turned around and
got it without dropping it,
ending her leg with Michigan
in ith.
Still, the Wolverines matched
their fifth seeding. Phelan
finished her opening leg in
seventh, and then after Long,
sophomore Danielle Pfeifer and
junior Brook Handler carried
the team from 11th to fifth.

Michigan coach James Henry.
"Competing at a high altitude

but at the same time, they were

to expect from the kids. They
just didn't get overwhelmed and

was a good accomplishment."

"To me, I just love

said. "I have a lot of confidence.

calmed herself down for an All-

In the. finals, she was
outpaced by just four seniors
and a junior and was one of two
underclassmen in the finals. The

sophomore has now trimmed.11

weeks.
Freshman Erin Finn placed
12th in the 5,000-meter run at
her first NCAA Championships,
earning second-team All-
American honors.
She used a fast start to take
the lead early in the race, but
the pack caught up to her in the
second half.
"That's how she runs - she
takes it, and she goes, and she
doesn't like pacing," Henry
said. "She'll just learn with
experience that there's different
tactics for races. If she had to do
it over again, that's her style,
and we let her do it."
Fifth-year senior pole vaulter
Kiley Tobel finished 15th at 13-9

honorable mention. She missed
all three tries at 14-1 feet,
leaving her personal record at

which included two freshmen,
two sophomores and a junior.

on the last possible day of the
season in front of a sold-out

Even after the loss, the team
could've taken comfort in the
fact that it already had taken the
regular-season conference title.
But Michigan doesn't look back,
and it didn't have time to harp
on Sunday's loss anyway. Just an
hour after the final buzzer, the
NCAA Tournament bracket was
announced and the Wolverines
had a new focus.
They were selected as a No.
2 seed and will play Wofford
on Thursday, and that's what
they're thinking about.
Even when they've had a
longer turnaround, it has been
the same story. Following any
game, regardless the outcome,
Michigan coach John Beilein
stresses that the team's focus is
on its upcoming opponent, not the
one it just played. Sure, they'll go
back to the game, watch film from
it, but they won't worry about it -
they worry about who's next.
That's part of the reason

Michigan hasn't lost back-to-
back games since February of
last year. The Wolverines don't
get hung up on their defeats they
prepare for their next victory.
No one expectsthem to lose to
No. 15-seeded Wofford, but the
loss Sunday could serve to help
Michigan as it preps.
"It might be good for us in
the end," said sophomore guard
Spike Albrecht. "I feel like we
always get better after a loss, so
I hope that's the case with this
one. ... Obviously, the NCAA
Tournament is no joke, but we
have high expectations for this
team going into thectournament."
This team is not Big Ten
champion anymore, they're just
another team - one of 68 - that
gets to play on, and despite being
slated in a challenging region
that includes the Shockers, Duke
and Louisville, it's not getting
ahead of itself.
"It's fun to look ahead and
see the possible options," said
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas.
"But with the tournament, you
never know. You can't assume
anything. We're just really
focused on this first game."
That's what Michigan did
all season, and it's a motto
that landed it a No. 2 seed
in the tournament. And the
Wolverines have no intention
on changing its one-game-
focused mentality now.

Wolverines validate themselves Series in Review:


By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
Minnesota had already
clinched the Big Ten regular-
season title. The Michigan
hockey team was fighting to
keep its NCAA Tournament
aspirations alive.
The Wolverines were hosting
their Senior Night. The Gophers
already had theirs.
Michigan's players and
coaches have preached all
season that they can beat
anyone in the country as long
as they play with the right focus
and intensity. Saturday, they had
every reason to prove it.
But even they didn't expect
the result, a 6-2 embarrassment
of No. 1 Minnesota at Yost Ice
Arena.
"Maybe we were too ready,"
said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "Some nights the
puck goes in, and some nights it
doesn't. Tonight, it went in.
"We proved we're not out of
place with these teams."
At 7 p.m., when the
Wolverines' five seniors stepped
onto the ice under a chorus of
'The Victors' for the last time
in Ann Arbor, they knew that
no performance could get them
another home game. But a win
would put Michigan (10-8-2-1
Big Ten, 18-12-4 overall) in a
better position for a berth in the
16-team NCAA Tournament,

remaining. But it wasn't just the seniors.

Freshman netminder Zach
Nagelvoort shined, especially
in the first period when he
bailed out his defense with
three saves on point-blank shots
on an early Minnesota power
play. When the Gophers looked
most threatening in that frame,
junior forward Phil Di Giuseppe
earned the Wolverines two
minutes of defensive relief by
fighting for the puck deep in the
offensive zone and eventually
drawing a holding penalty.
Carrying a 5-1 lead after 40
minutes, the third period almost
seemed like a formality until,
just 30 seconds in, sophomore
forward Andrew Copp scored
shorthanded - thanks in large
part to freshman Tyler Motte's
lunging, reaching clearance that
started the breakaway.
The crowd roared. Copp slid
on one knee in celebration. A
night after a heart-wrenching
overtime loss to the Gophers,
(14-3-3, 25-5-6) Michigan was

demonstrating it had the talent
and gusto to run them out of the
building.
"The fact that it's a
shorthanded goal takes an extra
jab at those guys," Bennett said.
"I said last night, 'We can beat
that team.' Tonight, we just
came out, and the second and
third period we were all over
them. That's the No. 1 team in
the country."
The result was Minnesota's
worst loss of the year and
a crucial victory for the
Wolverines, who understood
the stakes throughout every
moment of the game.
"We needed to get it done
tonight and we did," Bennett
said.
If nothing else, Michigan
finally proved on the ice what
had only been true in words this
season. And if the Wolverines
expect to be playing after next
weekend, they'll have to treat
each game with the same fervor.

What happened Friday:
They pushed and they shoved,
and after 60 minutes of gritty,
evenly matched hockey, two of the
nation's most storied programs
were deadlocked.
Then, with three minutes
remaining
in overtime, MINNESOTA 3
a slashing MICHIGAN 2
penalty
called on junior forward Derek
DeBlois left the No. 14 Michigan
hockey team shorthanded - just
its second penalty of the night -
and ultimately with its third loss
to No. 1 Minnesota, 3-2.
With the win, the Golden
Gophers clinched the first
regular-season Big Ten
conference championship.
"They're disappointed,
obviously," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "I mean you would
be too if you gave everything you
had, you played maybe your best
game of the year, and you came up
short, again."
Much to the dismay of a lively
crowd, both teams opted for
defense over offense in the third
period, shooting a combined
eight times in fifteen minutes.
Each shot became a rebound, and
each rebound became another
breakaway, but neither Michigan
(9-8-2 Big Ten, 17-11-4 overall) nor
Minnesota (14-2-3, 24-4-6) could
break the tie.
Then, with five seconds
remaining in regulation,
Minnesota defenseman Brady
Skjei - who scored the Golden
Gophers' first goal - took a pass
with an open lane towards the
net. He whiffed in front of the net,
sending Michigan into its eighth
overtime contest at Yost Ice Arena
this season.
"If we played like that every
night, we wouldn't be where we
are," Berenson said.
Erin Lennon, Daily Sports Writer

What happened Saturday:
Senior forward Luke Moffatt
scored two goals and added an
assist to lead the 13th-ranked
Wolverines to a 6-2 victory over
No. 1 Minnesota (14-3-3-0 Big
Ten, 25-5-6 overall) Saturday
night. Freshman goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort MINNESOTA 2
stopped MINN 6
25 shots,
while junior
forwards Zach Hyman and Phil Di
Giuseppe each added a goal to cap
off Michigan's Senior Night.
The win moves the Wolverines
(10-8-2-1, 18-12-4) into the top
15 of the Pairwise rankings - a
metric used to determine which
teams earn at-large spots in the
NCAA Tournament.
It also marks the first time
since a win over North Dakota in
1998 that Michigan defeated the a
No. 1 team in the nation at home.
"This weekend was a good
test for our team," Berenson said.
"And I thought we held up well."
After struggling to find
consistency in recent weeks, the
Wolverines put together one of
their strongest performances
of the year behind a relentless
forecheck, opportunistic offense
and timely saves when they most
needed a win.
"I thought you saw a killer
mentality that you haven't really
seen all year," said sophomore
forward Andrew Copp."
Moffatt first tallied 22 seconds
into the period, swinging his stick
like a baseball bat to drive in a
puck that hung in the air over the
crease from a deflection off the
boards. His second goal came on
a one-timer during a power-play
opportunity.
"I guess all those years of my
dad making me play baseball as
a child paid off, finally," Moffatt
said.

A satisfying home. inale for Mac Bennett

ac Bennett was lying
inahospital bed,
thinking this day
would never come.
The chance to step onto the
surface of Yost Ice Arena in the
final home game of his illustrious
career was no longer something
to look forward to. Because Feb.
22, the doctors at the University
hospital told Bennett his season
was over.
He had
sustained
a clean, but
heavy hit
in a game
against Penn
State that
evening and, IERMY
right away,
it looked bad SUMMITT
enough to end
his season.
But two hours after Bennett
received the news, the same
doctors told him they were just
kidding.
Well, not kidding, but rather
they made a mistake. Bennett's
injury wasn't as severe as they
initially thought. His season
wasn't over, and he could breathe
again. Senior Night wouldn't be
spent watching his teammates
from the stands after all.
It almost was. And then it was
almost spoiled again when the
Wolverines dropped an overtime
heartbreaker to Minnesota
Friday, a game they desperately
needed to win in order to
solidify any NCAA Tournament
aspirations. Instead, the Golden
Gophers clinched the regular-
season Big Ten championship.
That meant Saturday's
rematch was as big as they come.
With No.1 Minnesota in town,
on Senior Night, with a chance
to make a national statement and
squirm itsaway into the NCAA
Tournament, Michigan had all
the pressure on its shoulders.
"I couldn't ask for anything
more," Bennett said.
Thirty minutes before
Saturday's game, Bennett
emerged from the bowels of the
arena, in the middle of a line of
0

"If you just listen to him speak,
you can tell he's aleader," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
Bennett was the final member
of the senior class to be honored
Saturday. He came out of the
tunnel one last time, and all his
teammates were waiting for him
on the blue line. Bennett hugged
every one of them without letting
his contagious grin slip off his
face. When he got to his coach, he
said something that even made
Berenson crack a smile - a well-
known rarity.
Before all of Saturday's
theatrics, Bennett's goodbyes
had already started. After
Thursday's practice, he walked
off the ice to greet his parents
with a long embrace.
If those two hours in the
hospital room were a reality,
those hugs would have been
bittersweet. At the time, in that
room, he was all alone. It was
some of the worst news Bennett
could have imagined, and he
couldn't quite grasp that he
wouldn't play at Yost ever again.
He was lucky he didn't have to.
Instead, the sentiment comes
three weeks later. Bennett now
has to cope with the idea that
his career at Yost is certainly
over. There aren't any doctors
who can put him in front of
the Children of Yost for one
last time or show him an X-ray
that can function as a ticket
to singing a rendition of 'The
Victors' in the Southeast corner
of the arena.
But at the end of Senior
Night, Bennett was ina
comfortable place. He was
by the Michigan bench,
hugging his mother and father
again. Now, the feeling was
uncontrollably bittersweet,
and that much was evident as
Bennett held back tears during
the post-game press conference.
That final game at Yost
became a reality he had no
choice but to accept.
