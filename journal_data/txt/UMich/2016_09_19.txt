The University of Michigan 

Central Student Government 
hosted its third sober tailgate 
Saturday on Elbel Field in an 
attempt to prevent alcohol-
related incidents during late-
starting football games. 

The event was coordinated 

by LSA sophomore Grant Rivas, 
CSG’s 
chief 
programming 

officer, who said student safety 
is the first consideration with a 
3:30 p.m. kick off time like the 
Michigan vs. Colorado game.

“We as a university see an 

(uptick) 
on 
alcohol-related 

incidents and hospital visits,” 
Rivas said. “So with that game 
time, we definitely wanted to 
make an effort to make sure 
students are as safe as possible 
and just have a really fun event 
for all students.”

Rivas estimated that CSG 

handed out 350 pizzas and 
1,600 water bottles Saturday, 
serving 1,500 students in total. 
At the 2013 tailgate, the last 
time it took place, more than 

8,000 students were reported 
to have attended. Rivas said 
the difference in numbers can 
be attributed to the length of 
the tailgate and the time of the 
game. During the 2011 tailgate, 
the event lasted through most 
of the game, whereas Saturday’s 
was operating only between 

noon and kick-off.

Rivas 
said 
in 
the 
past, 

administrations 
have 
noted 

a significant decrease in the 
number 
of 
hospital 
visits 

because of the tailgate. During 
Saturday’s game, there was one 
arrest, one citation and four 
ejections due to alcohol in the 

stadium. 5 people were taken to 
the UM emergency department 
and medical personnel treated 
83 people after the game as well. 

Rivas said CSG has taken 

other 
measures 
to 
ensure 

student 
safety 
on 
gameday 

this year, including hydrations 

After the No. 4 Michigan football 

team handily put away its first two 
opponents of the season, it was 
assumed that its matchup with 
Colorado (2-0) would go almost 
as smoothly. Two minutes into 
the game, redshirt sophomore 
linebacker Jabrill Peppers crushed 
running back Phillip Lindsay for a 
2-yard tackle for loss to the crowd’s 
delight, and all seemed to be well. 

But the Buffaloes had different 

plans. On the next play, Colorado 
quarterback Sefo Liufau completed 
a 37-yard pass to wide receiver 
Devin Ross to get on the board first 
at Michigan Stadium.

It was just the start of a 

troublesome first half for the

During the leadup to the 

presidential 
election, 
The 

Michigan 
 
Daily 
is 
polling 

students about campaign issues 
every two weeks. This is the first 
iteration of the survey.

This 
week, 
the 
survey 

was sent to 1,000 University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
and 

received 154 responses over a 

period of four days. The sample 
was chosen randomly from 
University undergraduates and 
reported in the aggregate.

When asked whom they 

would vote for if the election 
were today, given the two main 
party candidates, respondents 
overwhelmingly 
favored 

Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton 
over 
Republican 

nominee Donald Trump by 
a margin of 80 percent to 9

LSA junior Mason Van Gieson and LSA senior Angel Antoun perform in “Out of Silence” Friday night at the Mendelssohn Theater.

The 
cast 
of 
 
“Out 
of 

Silence,” an episodic theatre 
performance 
consisting 
of 

students and alumni, reenacted 
a variety of adapted stories 
about women deciding to have 
an 
abortion 
in 
Mendellson 

Theater on Friday.

Brittany 
Batell, 
a 
dual 

master’s 
student 
in 
the 

Schools of Social Work and 
Public Health, organized the 
performance 
in 
conjunction 

with 
her 
internship 
this 

summer with the nonprofit 
Michigan 
Organization 
on 

Adolescent 
Sexual 
Health. 

Batell said she selected this 
project 
to 
concentrate 
on 

over the summer because the 
theatrical aspect of “Out of 
Silence” resonated with her.

“I 
just 
really 
felt 
an 

affinity with the idea of doing 
public health work through 
creative 
expression 
and 

trying to help innovate health 
communications that way,” she 
said.

The performance, she added, 

aimed to humanize an issue 
that is often submerged in 

political discourse.

“We hear all the time about 

the politics of this, we hear 
about different definitions of 
personhood and we hear about 
statistics, and those really don’t 
resonate in the same way that 
people’s stories do because 
you can’t argue with that; you 
can’t argue with someone’s real 
experience,” she said.

The 1 in 3 Campaign, a 

national project of Advocates 
for Youth that aims to spark 
conversation about abortion, 
created the script of “Out of 
Silence” 
from 
submissions 

from more than 400 women 

concerning their experiences 
with abortion. They then had 
playwrights craft 12 different 
five-minute 
vignettes 
from 

these submissions, eight of 
which were part of Friday’s 
performance.

LSA senior Katrina Hamann, 

co-director of “Out of Silence,” 
noted how the format of the 
show 
was 
essential 
to 
its 

humanizing goal.

“Doing it with eight different 

stories as opposed to one play 
about one particular situation 
humanizes the issue for people 
who may not know what to

The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of College Republicans 

released an endorsement of GOP 

presidential nominee Donald Trump 

and his vice-presidential candidate, 

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, on Sunday.

In a statement, the chapter’s 

president, LSA junior Enrique 

Zalamea, wrote though not all 

Republicans agree with everything 

Trump has said, the chapter chose to 

endorse him because Trump’s beliefs 

best align with the conservative 

ideals the chapter upholds.

“I know that some you may 

not agree with all of Mr. Trump’s 

statements and policies, but the 

campaign is not about one person,” 

Zalamea wrote. “Mr. Trump in the 

White House comes with an entire 

administration of conservatives 

that, as Republicans, share many 

of the same ideals that we would 

not see represented under Clinton’s 

presidency. And any vote not for 

Trump is a vote for Clinton.”

Mirroring a nationwide trend 

among some GOP officials, several 

campus College Republicans groups 

have declined to endorse Trump, 

though it is customary for them 

to endorse the nominee. Harvard 

Republican Club refused to endorse 

Trump in August, the first time the 

group refused to endorse a republican 

nominee since 1888.

The UM College Republicans’ 

endorsement comes several months 

after Trump was officially selected 

as the nominee at the Republican 

National Convention in July. It is 

also later than other endorsements 

on campus from political groups — 

the University’s chapter of College 

Democrats endorsed Trump’s 

opponent, Hillary Clinton, on July 

12 in a Facebook post after Clinton’s 

Democratic opponent Sen. Bernie 

Sanders (I–Vt.) dropped out of the 

race and endorsed her.

“College Democrats at the 

University of Michigan is proud to 

officially endorse Hillary Clinton 

as the Democratic nominee for 

President,” the post read. “Secretary 

Clinton is a historic candidate, 

steadfast progressive, and — to 

echo President Obama: ‘There has 

never been any man or woman more 

qualified for this office than Hillary, 

ever, and that’s the truth.’”

Along with endorsing Trump, 

Zalamea also urged students to vote 

straight-ticket for other conservative 

candidates to make a difference on all 

levels of government.

“Regardless of your views on Mr. 

Trump, I encourage you all to make 

the effort to go to the polls and vote 

down-ballot Republican for your state 

and congressional candidates,” he 

wrote.

WHAT THE SOUND

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Munch performs at The Bling Pig during What The Sound on Friday. 

think about abortion as more 
than a one-dimensional sort of 
issue,” she said. “So they can 
relate to the characters and see 
them in a light that is not one 
of shame and stigma, which is 
kind of the dominant narrative 
that this country has about 
reproductive justice.”

In addition to the eight 

vignettes that were part of the 
original script, Daniel Bizer-
Cox, who graduated in 2013 
LSA, wrote an epilogue to the 
performance. He said writing 
this piece was an attempt to 
articulate his emotions on this 
topic.

“It was very cathartic to 

put pen to paper about such a 
really important issue that’s so 
divisive,” he said. “I wanted to 
try and find a way that I could 
express all the feelings that I 
had, especially in the political 
climate that we live in, and 
it can be so oppressive and 
frustrating so it was nice to 
feel like I could actually have 
a voice.”

The epilogue came in the 

form of a slam poem and 
included some of the political 
discourse the rest of the 
performance avoided. Bizer-
Cox called it a call to action, 
especially 
in 
light 
of 
the 

presidential election.

“The 2016 election was very 

prevalent in my mind when 
I was writing it, and I think 
it will come across in that as 
well, and it talks about a lot of 
the things that politicians are 
currently trying to do to limit 
access to abortion,” he said.

Overall, Hamann said the 

show intended to emphasize 
both the personal and the 
physical 
factors 
behind 

abortion.

“It’s 
really 
just 
getting 

beyond this abstract idea of 
abortion and really putting 
faces to the stories,” she said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Madison 

Atkins, 
who 
attended 
the 

event, said she appreciated this 
personal and varied approach 
to the issue.

“I definitely liked the gray 

aspects of it, that it wasn’t just 
‘Oh, they were raped and then 
they had an abortion because 
they were raped,’ ” she said. 

“There were these different 
aspects that played into it that 
were really interesting, and I’m 
glad that they showed.”

Nursing 
sophomore 
Kara 

Hoffman said the performance 
resonated with her due to her 
planned profession.

“I’m 
also 
a 
nursing 

student, so I wanted to get 
the perspective from future 
patients, because I’m going to 
have patients who go through 
this eventually,” she said.

A talkback panel followed 

the 
performance, 
which 

included representatives from 
a variety of health nonprofits 
and health professionals.

Hamann noted the panel was 

an important part of helping 
the audience digest the themes 
presented in the vignettes.

“I think it would be not doing 

the show justice if we didn’t 
have some sort of talk-back just 
to engage the audience a little 
bit more,” she said.

The 
panel 
discussed 

stigma in relation to abortion, 
advocacy, general reproductive 
justice 
and 
personal 

experience. They also accepted 
questions 
from 
audience 

members.

Panelist 
Timothy 

Johnson, 
chair 
of 

Obstetrics and Gynecology 
at 
the 
University, 

applauded the provocative 
nature of the play and 
said many of the stories 
resonated with him as a 
physician.

“I take care of patients 

every day, and each one of 
those stories is a patient,” 
he said. “I’ve taken care 
of probably 10,000, 15,000 
people who’ve terminated 
their 
pregnancy. 
And 

that’s not a big part of 
what I do, but I’ve heard 
all those stories.”

Engineering sophomore 

Natalia 
Martinez 
also 

voiced appreciation for the 
variety of stories, as well 
as the way they challenged 
the stigmas surrounding 
abortions.

“People tend to treat 

abortion as one evil act 
and they tend not to look 
at the bigger picture,” she 
said.

percent. 11 percent said they 
planned to vote for “other.”

When given the option to 

vote for third-party candidates 
such as Libertarian nominee 
Gary Johnson and Green Party 
nominee Jill Stein, main party 
candidates 
lost 
nearly 
equal 

amounts of support, with Clinton 
dropping to 75 percent and Trump 
to 6 percent. Johnson received 13 
percent and Stein 3 percent, with 
3 percent of respondents still 
choosing other. This contrasts 
with the statewide polls for 
Michigan, which cite Clinton at 
43 percent, Trump at 37.8 percent, 
Johnson at 7.3 percent and Stein 
receiving 2.8 percent. 

The support of alternative 

candidates on campus mirrors a 
local trend in the GOP primary 
— 
Ohio 
Gov. 
John 
Kasich 

received the majority of votes 
in Washtenaw County, though 
Trump easily carried the state 
overall.

The University’s chapter of 

College 
Republicans 
did 
not 

respond to repeated requests for 

comment on the data,

Both Stein and Johnson are 

on the Michigan ballot for the 
election.

The 
high 
percentage 
of 

students favoring Clinton can be 
seen in her heightened presence 
on 
campus, 
with 
an 
active 

Students for Hillary chapter 
and the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats’ promotion 
of her events since endorsing her 
on July 12 following her primary 
opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 
(I) dropping from the race. Vice 
Presidential 
candidate 
Tim 

Kaine recently visited campus 
for a speech and rally on the 
Diag. In comparison, the College 
Republicans 
only 
endorsed 

Trump on Sunday, and the 
Students for Trump chapter has 
since become inactive.

College 
Democrat 
Taiwo 

Dosunmu wrote in an email 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily that he wasn’t shocked by 
the survey results.

“The results of the survey 

indicating overwhelming support 
for 
Hillary 
Clinton 
among 

students are not surprising given 
the immense impact this election 
will have on the future of our 

country and the stark contrast 
between the two candidates,” 
he wrote. “Students understand 
that, on every substantive issue, 
Hillary Clinton will make the 
right choices for them– especially 
related 
to 
higher 
education. 

Considering her progressive plans 
focused specifically on students, 
like debt-free college for all and 
tuition-free college for families 
making less than $125,000 a year, 
students recognize that Hillary 
is the ally they need in the White 
House.”

In terms of voting habits 

overall, regardless of who they 
chose to vote for, 73 percent of 
respondents said they would 
“definitely” vote in the upcoming 
election. Another 16 percent 
stating they “probably” would 
and just 3 percent stated they 
“definitely would not” vote.

Eighty-six percent of survey 

respondents were registered to 
vote, 13 percent were not and one 
respondent was too young to vote. 
A majority of those registered 
— 79 percent — are registered in 
Michigan. Voting rates among 
students are traditionally low, 
with only 45% of young people 
voting in the presidential election.

Wolverines, but they ultimately 
rebounded to win, 45-28. Michigan 
never relinquished its lead for the 
last 28 minutes of the game. 

Michigan fell behind early, 21-7, 

before scoring 17 unanswered points 
to take a 24-21 lead into halftime. On 
the Wolverines’ last drive before the 
break, Speight threw a short pass 
to fifth-year senior wide receiver 
Amara Darboh, who took it 45 
yards down the left sideline to give 
Michigan its first lead of the game 
with 34 seconds left in the half. 

“We weren’t worried,” said senior 

tight end Jake Butt. “In fact, we 
actually talked about it last night as a 
team. We knew, the first two games, 
we were really never punched in the 
face with things going so smoothly, 
and it’s not going to be a fairy tale 
the whole entire season. There was 
going to come a point in time when 
we were going to get punched in the 
face. … We were good enough to get 
it done.”

The 
Buffaloes 
scored 
on 

consecutive series within the first 
five minutes of the game, and 
their second score was especially 
impressive. 
Colorado 
defensive 

back 
Chidobe 
Awuzie 
sacked 

redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight, forcing a fumble on 
Michigan’s 28-yard line. Defensive 
lineman Derek McCartney picked 
it up and ran it in for the touchdown 
to give the Buffaloes a 14-point lead. 

 The back-and-forth scoring 

continued into the third quarter, 
when, only a minute into the second 
half, Liufau completed a 70-yard 
touchdown pass to Shay Fields to 
make it 28-24. 

 But the Wolverines scored on 

the next drive and never looked 
back. Sophomore wide receiver 
Grant Perry got open on a 54-yard 
pass, bringing the ball to Colorado’s 
7-yard line. Senior running back 
De’Veon Smith and redshirt junior 
running back Ty Isaac did the rest 
of the work, with Isaac punctuating 
the drive with a 1-yard scoring run. 

Peppers did most of Michigan’s 

legwork throughout the game, 
recording nine tackles and a sack, 3.5 
for loss. On his most impressive play 
of the game, he ran a punt return 
54 yards to the house for his first 
touchdown of the season with 11:27 
to go in the game. It was his first 
career punt return touchdown.

“In a game of really good players 

all over the field, Jabrill Peppers 
proved that he was the best player 
out there,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “It was a special game by 
a special player.” 

Added 
Peppers: 
“It 
was 

indescribable. I think I just laid 
there. I was like, ‘Finally, man.’ The 
guys did a great job of giving me a 
crease. They just trust me enough to 
hit what I see and make something 
happen and that’s what I did.” 

The Wolverines sputtered early 

behind 
Speight, 
who 
finished 

16-for-30 with 229 yards and one 
touchdown, throwing multiple near-
interceptions but no actual ones. 
Michigan’s special teams kept the 

Wolverines in the game during the 
offensive struggles, accounting for 
their first score of the game. Senior 
safety Delano Hill and fifth-year 
senior tight end Michael Jocz broke 
through to block Colorado’s punt, 
allowing Grant Perry to scoop up the 
ball for a touchdown. 

Michigan started gaining the 

momentum that would take it to 
victory late in the second quarter 
when 
Colorado 
kicker 
Diego 

Gonzalez missed a 36-yard field goal 
and punter Alex Kinney kicked the 
ball into the back of his own lineman 
to give the Wolverines the ball on its 
own 38-yard line. On the ensuing 
drive, Speight dumped the ball off to 
fifth-year senior wide receiver Jehu 
Chesson for a 17-yard touchdown. 

Fifth-year senior kicker Kenny 

Allen finished the game 1-for-3 on 
field goal attempts. He missed from 
37 and 44 yards out, with his only 
made kick coming with 1:59 to go 
until halftime. 

The Wolverines made mistake 

after mistake early, but with help 
from Peppers and Butt, who finished 
with seven catches for 87 yards, 
Michigan stifled the upset attempt 
to stay undefeated. 

“We definitely have to get the 

big plays corrected,” Peppers said. 
“But the best part about it that it’s 
all things we can correct. It’s not like 
they were just flat out beating us. 
Everything can be coached up and 
corrected. We took a couple lumps 
today, but when we go back and 
watch the tape, we know those big 
plays don’t happen if we stick to the 
deep middle.”

stations in front of Greek life 
houses that are partnered with 
CSG. Last year, it started funding 
University Dining to open a few 
hours earlier so students can eat 
before tailgating.

“This is kind of another step in 

that pattern we’ve taken to try to 
make game day a safer event for 
students, so we don’t see a lot of 
hospital visits,” Rivas said. 

Students from the Center for 

Campus Involvement were also 
a part of the event, handing out 
pizza and water bottles. One of 
the employees, LSA sophomore 
Ingrid Lindquist, said the tailgate 
helps 
bring 
people 
together 

before the game.

“I think it keeps people more 

safe before a game because a lot 
of drinking sometimes goes on, 
and it helps people remember 
to eat and drink water and just 
enjoy it for celebrating U of M for 
the team and the school, rather 
than a bad way,” Lindquist said.

Fellow 
CCI 
employee 

Elizabeth 
Kruse, 
an 
LSA 

sophomore, 
agreed 
with 

Lindquist.

“I think having a tailgate like 

this is important for students who 
don’t want to go out and party, 
but they can still do something 
fun before the game,” Kruse said.

Several attendees said they 

came to tailgate mostly for the 
free food.

Engineering 
senior 
Zach 

Weglarz said the tailgate was 
important for underage students, 

which LSA freshman Samantha 
Adsit and Rackham graduate 
Aaron Barber echoed.

“I think it’s good to have one of 

these so you can remember it and 
have fun,” Adsit said.

“I definitely think (the sober 

tailgate) is important,” Barber 
said. “I understand people who 
enjoy that just, like, in their life, 
but I kind of don’t want to do 
that before a football game. You 
kind of want to enjoy the game. 
You spend money on the tickets, 
you want to support a really good 
team and you kind of want to 
enjoy the game. And you can be 
as goofy and have as much fun if 
you don’t drink.”

The tailgate also included 

giveaways and free suite tickets 
for a future Michigan football 
game.

as a way of addressing the issue of 
student debt. Trump, in contrast, 
has yet to release a comprehensive 
plan for student debt, though he 
has talked at length about the issue 
of student debt. His campaign has 
continuously promised to release 
thri platform on higher education 
sometime in the upcoming weeks.

Trump:
Donald Trump, while making 

comments on the levels of student 
debt in the country several times 
during the campaign, has not 
released a comprehensive plan 
to address it. The overall GOP 
platform, consisting of more 60 
pages, does have two sections 
pertaining to college costs and 
general higher education.

The platform calls in particular 

for the federal government to 
abstain from involvement with 
student loans, opting instead for 
the private sector to participate in 
student financing.

The party is also calling for all 

government regulations, including 
those that govern interest rates for 
student loans, to be scrutinized 
and challenged against potential 
negative economic impact on 
students and families.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Emma TerBeek, a supporter of 
the Republican Party, wrote in an 
email interview she believes the 
GOP’s conservative approach to 
student debt would better benefit 
current debt holders.

“It is my belief that high student 

debt is a huge concern for all 
U.S. citizens regardless of party 
affiliation,” TerBeek wrote. “My 
personal Conservative views are 
solely that Americans should rely 
more on privatized scholarships 
versus 
government 
loans 
or 

subsidies that stem from taxpayer 
dollars.”

The official platform states, “In 

order to encourage new modes 
of higher education delivery to 
enter the market, accreditation 
should be decoupled from federal 
financing, and states should be 
empowered to allow a wide array 
of accreditation and credentialing 
bodies to operate.”

The party made clear that 

they 
intend, 
by 
encouraging 

privatization, to give students 
more room to “customize their 
college 
experience,” 
according 

to the official platform. Trump, 
at multiple points during his 

campaign, has also pledged to 
“tremendously” cut funding for 
the Department of Education.

Sarah 
Anderson, 

communications director of the 
Michigan Republican Party, said 
in spite of the lack of an official 
platform on the issue, higher 
education is extremely important 
to the Republican Party.

“It is absolutely an issue for 

the Republican Party, and I do 
believe that Donald Trump will 
take it seriously,” Anderson said. 
“(The issue is) one that should 
be debated and one that we 
should talk about. Pie-in-the-sky 
promises are not going to help our 
future generations.”

Even though younger voters 

tend to lean liberal, the typically 
the older Republican voter base is 
still affected by the rising student 
debt in America, as many voters 
have children in college. 

TerBeek noted she has personal 

interest in tuition debt as a student, 
but believes she and the rest of the 
student population should be held 
responsible.

“As a student I feel that student 

debt is a significant issue in my 
personal life but feel that in the 
grand scheme of things, I should 
not rely on the government to pay 
for me to go to school as I could 
have gone to other schools where 
I had scholarships (as did most 
people that go to U of M) but chose 
to go to a more expensive school 
where I didn’t have a scholarship,” 
TerBeek wrote.

Trump’s comparative lack of 

focus on higher education has 
become a campaign issue for 
Democrats — in a recent stop at 
the University of Michigan, U.S. 
Sen. Tim Kaine (D–VA), Clinton’s 
vice 
presidential 
nominee, 

highlighted 
Trump’s 
lack 
of 

discussion on student debt. In an 
interview with Time magazine, 
Kaine also touched on the issue, 
saying Trump’s lack of a plan 
shows when “he brags about his 
own four-year degree from an Ivy 
League school, he has no intention 
of offering anyone else the same 
opportunity.”

Anderson, however, charged 

that the Democratic approach to 
student debt will only serve to 
create future problems.

“The contrast is that Hillary 

Clinton 
is 
promising 
free 

education, but there is no such 
thing as a free lunch,” Anderson 
said. “Free education means that 
somebody down the line has to 
pay for it. If you go to college for 

‘free’ you’re going to have a hard 
time finding a job because taxes 
are going to be so high, businesses 
are going to close down.”

Clinton:
During the campaign, Clinton, 

Kaine 
and 
other 
Democratic 

officials 
have 
made 
many 

statements on how to fix student 
debt in America. As part of her 
New College Compact, she is 
calling on state governments 
to pull their weight and invest 
in higher education, in hopes 
of helping to lower the cost of 
tuition. The plan estimates that 
this investment will, by 2021, offer 
students free community college 
and the option to graduate from 
a public college or university in 
their state without having to take 
on student debt.

The 
Clinton 
administration 

also plans to create a $25 billion 
fund to support historically Black 
institutions and other minority-
serving institutions, to make 
higher education accessible. 

Clinton has also released a plan 

to tackle current student debt. Of 
the many objectives within this 
plan, some of the more prominent 
are cutting interest rates and 
refinancing loans at the current 
rate, aiming to alleviate pressure 
from an estimated 25 million debt 
holders. The Clinton campaign 
would also plans to halt actions of 
for-profit schools and lenders they 
charge take advantage of students 
in need, as well as simplify the 
repayment process for loans.

Clinton’s heavy focus on student 

debt speaks may speak in part to 
the younger nature of her base 
— the Harvard Political Review 
reported 2015 that 60 percent 
of 18- to 29-year-olds supported 
President Barack Obama in the 
2012 election.

LSA junior Taiwo Dosunmu, 

communications director of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said he sees student 
debt as a top priority for the 
Democratic Party as a whole.

“The Democratic Party has 

always been pushed forward by 
the energy of younger people and 
college students,” Dosunmu said. 
“Those people are being impacted 
by student debt, so top to bottom 
it’s a major issue.”

Part of Clinton’s plans also 

stemmed from Sen. Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT) unsuccessful campaign for 
the Democratic nomination.

ack 
Avenue 
is 
a 

14-mile-long street in 
Detroit and provides 

one of the most unique views of 
the city imaginable. Starting at 
Woodward Avenue in Midtown, 
this road cuts across the east side 
of Detroit. This street is one of the 
most 
controversial 

streets in the nation. 
For three miles on 
the city’s east side, Mack Avenue 
forms the eastern border of the 
city of Detroit. On the west side 
of the street is the predominantly 
Black city of Detroit, and on the 
east, the five municipalities that 
make up the wealthy suburb of 
Grosse Pointe.

While the conversation about 

life around such a marked division 
line is largely up for debate, many 
people have argued that being 
from one side or the other allows 
for a greater or lesser quality 
of life. In August, EdBuild — a 
nonprofit dedicated to school 
funding equity — rated the 
Grosse Pointe-Detroit border the 
“most segregating school district 
boundary” in America. It is an 
undeniable fact that being a child 
in Grosse Pointe allows for much 
more opportunity than that same 
child’s counterpart who lives on 
the other side of Mack Avenue. 

When I went to the border line 

on Mack Avenue, I was shocked. 
Less than a mile from Detroit, 
charming 
houses 
reeking 
of 

wealth lined the streets, and 
middle-aged white people were 
walking their dogs on every 
block. The premier high school, 

Grosse 
Pointe 
South, 
has 
a 

campus fit for an Ivy League prep 
school, with restaurants across 
the street advertising “house 
accounts” for the students, paid 
for by their parents. One resident I 
interviewed, Mr. Cornell Walker, 
has two children in the Grosse 

Pointe school district 
and 
admitted 
that 

children on the Grosse 

Pointe side have more opportunity 
than students in Detroit.

These 
differences 
aren’t 

simply chalked up to how each 
municipality divides up its money. 
On the Detroit side of Mack, the 
median income is just more than 
$26,000 per year. However, the 
Grosse Pointe side has a median 
household income of more than 
$90,000 per year. The differences 
don’t stop there, as the youth 
poverty rate is 49 percent on the 
Detroit side and only 7 percent 
on the other. Keep in mind that 
these two cities are neighbors, 
neighbors who share a common 
border and are in the same county.

So why care? It’s no secret 

that suburban schools have more 
money and can afford nicer things 
for their students than inner-city 
schools, isn’t it? The alarming 
fact here isn’t simply that there is 
a difference between one school 
and another; it’s the size of the 
difference. Many Detroit Public 
Schools 
are 
underperforming, 

and, for many families, there are 
no other options for their students 
short of risking placement of 
their child in a charter school. 
However, 
for 
Grosse 
Pointe 

residents, having the eighth-best 
high school in the state as the 
default option affords unlimited 
amounts of educational potential.

Additionally, 
Grosse 
Pointe 

schools play an active role in 
these 
segregationist 
policies. 

The school’s official policy bans 
students who do not live within the 
district, which is 93 percent white, 
from enrolling and says that any 
students “found to be ineligible 
to be enrolled shall be promptly 
removed.” It’s as simple as that. 
If you live on one side of the line 
but go to school on the other and 
the school finds out, you’re kicked 
out of school, back across Mack 
Avenue into Detroit. This isn’t a 
niche concern of residents either; 
Walker expressed concerns about 
“students from other districts 
(who) falsely use a Grosse Pointe 
address to go to the schools, and 
when you put it like that, it is not 
fair to the taxpayers (of Grosse 
Pointe).” Many residents feel this 
way and even feel as though the 
presence of students from Detroit 
is more of a problem than the 
students of Detroit having less 
opportunity and lower quality of 
education than in Grosse Pointe.

The days of “white only” 

schools may have been declared 
over by the famed Brown v. Board 
of Education decision of 1954, 
but segregation is far from over. 
East English Village Preparatory 
Academy, a DPS high school, 
is more than 99 percent Black, 
however, just two miles away, 
Grosse Pointe South High School 
is 84 percent white. Two miles. 

That’s the distance from the 
Hill neighborhood to Michigan 
Stadium. Anyone who claims 
that there is no segregation of 
the schools by this line is not 
grounded in reality.

It is unacceptable that Detroit’s 

urban schools have come to this 
point. Brown v. Board of Education 
may have been a good starting 
point for the desegregation of 
schools, but that mission has 
grossly failed. This problem isn’t 
simply limited to the Grosse Pointe 
and Detroit border either. Many 
University of Michigan students 
come from areas similar to this 
one that are equally as segregated. 
I strongly urge my readers to look 
back upon their own experiences 
in their own schools and think of 
times that school segregation has 
caused them an unfair chance 
at success. Furthermore, as the 
future generation of policymakers 
and parents, we need to find a way 
to genuinely desegregate schools.

How can students from these 

districts, 
known 
as 
“island 

districts,” take pride in their 
accomplishments knowing that 
the deck is stacked in their favor 
so grossly? The extreme levels of 
hypocrisy and racism that play out 
here every day is unacceptable in 
any society, nonetheless a society 
that frequently calls itself free of 
racism and segregation. We must 
do better than segregated schools, 
and we must face the reality of the 
problem that we have created.

Sexual misconduct education is key
S 

ince the U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation into 
the University of Michigan’s handling of sexual misconduct cases in 
2014, the University has made multiple efforts to protect students from 

sexual assault on campus. Last year, the University surveyed the student 
body in the Campus Climate Survey, and revised and released a new sexual 
misconduct policy — renaming it “The University of Michigan Policy and 
Procedures on Student Sexual and Gender-based Misconduct and other forms 
of Interpersonal Violence.” Changes to the policy included an expansion of the 
definitions of consent and intoxication, a restructuring of the appeals process 
within the reporting process and the promotion of a multitude of resources for 
survivors on campus. The one call behind all these efforts, by both students 
and administrators alike, has been and should continue to be increased 
education about sexual assault prevention and the reporting process.

Brown v. Board is dead

L

ast year, as a poor college 
kid desperate for extra 
cash, I stupidly decided 

to start playing DraftKings — a 
daily fantasy sports site where 
you are able to win money by 
spending as little as three bucks 
to win much, much 
more 
than 
your 

buy-in. I played for 
weeks, not winning, 
and finally told my 
girlfriend to hold me 
accountable — that 
if I ever mentioned 
playing DraftKings 
again, she should say 
no or slap my wrist.

Don’t 
get 
me 

wrong 
— 
I 
love 

football. My fondest 
memories 
of 
childhood 
are 

watching games every Sunday 
on the couch with my father. In 
fact, I still played fantasy football 
in multiple leagues. I didn’t 
play for the money, though, but 
just for the thrill of beating my 
friends when my players — who 
are risking their lives every time 
they step on the gridiron — play 
better than the athletes (who are 
also risking their lives) on my 
opponent’s team.

That’s why I’m not playing 

this year. In my point of view, if 
you really think about it, those 
who play fantasy football are 
getting angry at players if they 
perform terribly, making money 
and jeering friends when a life-
threatening sport is involved. 
We’re capitalizing — earning 
money and bragging rights — 
off players essentially risking 
their lives.

The sport of football is not 

being taken as seriously as it 
should be. There are far more 
laughs and cheers when we should 
be wincing as men are engaging 
in one of the most dangerous 
sports. The reality of the sport 
should not be glossed over. 
Instead of throwing fits over poor 
performance, we should be more 
upset about the jarring concussion 
statistics that have become all too 
associated with the sport.

Concussions in the NFL and 

the impact they have on players 

during and after their careers are 
too haunting for me to participate 
in fantasy football for now. I 
simply cannot be invested in how 
someone performs for my virtual 
benefit when something could 
happen on Sunday that could 

change their life. Yes, 
I know they’re making 
millions of dollars. Yes, 
I’m aware that most 
players aren’t hurt in 
life-threatening ways 
in a typical game, but 
who knows what the 
health 
of 
today’s 

Aaron Rodgers and 
Cam Newton will be 
like decades down 
the road? And yes, 
concussion protocols 

are stricter in the NFL (leading 
to better player safety) and 
hits to the head are now being 
called 
as 
major 
penalties, 

but a study released in April 
by the American Academy 
of Neurology said that more 
than 40 percent of retired 
NFL players showed signs of 
traumatic brain injury.

Even some current players 

are choosing to leave the game 
early because of the reality that 
head injuries are very common. 
After one year in the NFL, star 
rookie Chris Borland decided 
to retire, citing a concern that 
he could sustain head injuries 
if he played any longer. One 
of the NFL’s all-time greatest 
linebackers, 
Junior 
Seau, 

committed suicide almost four 
years ago and it was found 
that he suffered from chronic 
traumatic 
encephalopathy, 

a 
progressive 
degenerative 

disease in the brain that 
results from large or repeated 
hits to the head.

So much of the focus is on 

that one big hit that knocked 
someone 
out 
cold, 
when 

arguably the same attention 
should be given to the lineman 
who might smash helmets 
every single play. Even non-
head injuries take a toll on 
players. The Lions’ beloved 
wide receiver Calvin Johnson 
retired this offseason when 

everyone thought he had many 
more 
spectacular 
seasons 

ahead of him. As much as I 
will miss him, I respect his 
decision and cannot criticize 
him 
for 
prioritizing 
self-

care. His actions, much like 
Borland’s, are commendable. 
We must put a player’s health 
over our affinity for them.

I realize I am faced with 

a 
conundrum 
because 
I’m 

still a fan of the sport and I 
still contribute to the sport 
by watching my Lions every 
Sunday as if it’s an extension 
of my religious activity after 
going to church. I’m not saying 
that we should stop watching 
football or stop playing fantasy 
football, but that we should 
examine and recognize that 
football is dangerous, first and 
foremost. The players know 
the risks and keep playing. The 
fans can know the risks the 
stars on the field are making 
and keep watching.

Football should be thought 

of as more than entertainment. 
Football has serious health 
implications. All I see on 
Saturdays and Sundays during, 
before and after games are 
questions such as whether 
Harbaugh ate a booger at the 
end of the UCF game (I think 
he was just biting a hangnail) 
or if Lions fans will be able to 
stop saying “At least there’s 
next year!” this season.

There must be more of open 

discussion on how the game is 
dangerous and what is being 
done to make it safer. We boo 
on targeting calls, but how 
often do we stop and think, 
“Geez, is the player that got hit 
going to be OK?” Will we value 
their health instead of their 
performance 
and 
presence 

needed to win a game?

So while I cheer when my 

favorite teams get to the end 
zone, I pray at the same time 
that they’ll be safe out there. 
Stay strong, but take care of 
yourselves, my brothers.

Last Monday, the most recent 

addition to educational efforts 
came in the form of an online 
portal 
that 
educates 
faculty 

of their role when reporting 
sexual 
misconduct. 
This 

online tool will streamline the 
reporting process for designated 
University-affiliated 
personnel 

and offer training for all faculty 
members on what is and is not 
inappropriate conduct, how to 
support students who share 
information about misconduct 
and how to notify the University 
of instances of misconduct.

While the portal is definitely 

a step in the right direction, 
it 
does 
not 
guarantee 
the 

education of all faculty because 
it is not mandatory for faculty to 
complete its training program. It 
is quite likely some faculty will 
not put the time aside to review 
the material. For students to reap 
the full benefits of this tool, all 
faculty members need to be on 
board with using the tool as a 
means for protecting the safety 

of their students. Since the tool’s 
success is contingent upon how 
many faculty actually use it, at 
a bare minimum the University 
should require all faculty and 
employees of the University to 
complete the training.

This 
step 
forward 
also 

illuminates 
more 
holes 
in 

sexual misconduct education on 
campus, specifically concerning 
how mandatory reporting applies 
to students when they decide to 
share information with a faculty 
member. 
Students 
need 
not 

only be aware of to whom and 
how best they can report a case 
of sexual misconduct — which 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center outlines 
on its website well — but 
when they are subject to being 
reported by faculty. The current 
policy requires most faculty 
and administrators and many 
employees to report a case of 
sexual misconduct to the Office 
for Institutional Equity if a 
student shares information with 

them. Yet there are individual 
positions that offer confidential 
services and are excluded from 
the reporting requirement, such 
as counselors at Counseling 
and Psychological Services and 
SAPAC.

These types of exceptions of 

mandatory reporting need to be 
made clear to students so they 
understand the appropriate place 
and person to turn to. There 
must be better education for 
students about the parameters of 
mandatory reporting. It is only 
just that students are aware of 
their rights when it comes to their 
privacy and options of reporting 
a case of sexual misconduct.

The 
University 
has 
a 

responsibility to mandate that 
all faculty and employees must 
complete the training via this 
online portal, as well as create 
similar 
educational 
efforts 

for students about mandatory 
reporting 
policies 
and 

procedures.

I know that some (of) you may not agree with all of Mr. 

Trump’s statements and policies, but the campaign is 
not about one person. Mr. Trump in the White House 
comes with an entire administration of conservatives... 

And any vote not for Trump is a vote for Clinton.

Rackham 
Auditorium 
was 

filled 
with 
#20 
jerseys 
on 

Saturday 
night 
as 
Literati 

Bookstore 
warmly 
welcomed 

retired 
USA 
soccer 
player, 

Olympic gold medalist and FIFA 
World 
Cup 
Champion 
Abby 

Wambach.

While 
fans 
are 
used 
to 

watching Wambach on the field, 
she now tours as the author of 
her new memoir. “Forward” 
follows her life as she grows from 
an athletic, yet overlooked, child 
of seven to becoming one of the 
most successful soccer players 
the world has ever seen. With 
on- and off-the-field memories, 
defeats and triumphs, she tells 
her story with honesty and élan.

Saturday’s event, an on-stage 

interview, began with Wambach 
explaining that she has never 
actually watched the ball hit the 
net.

“It’s a momentary blackout,” 

she told the interviewer. In the 
first chapter of her book, she 
wrote: “Although my eyes were 
open and aimed in the right 
direction, as soon as leather met 
rope the picture went black…”

She explained the adrenaline 

rushes, the pressures of being 
a team leader and the lack of 
choice she had in playing the 
game of soccer.

“I was so good at what I did, I 

never felt like I had a choice,” she 
said. However, she added that 
she “never wanted to be known 
as just a soccer player.”

Wambach 
also 
made 
a 

powerful name for herself as an 
advocate for equal rights. As the 
leading scorer (184 career goals) 

of any male or female player, 
Wambach set high standards for 
all soccer players and athletes.

“I’m in my prime for this,” she 

told the audience. Her career, 
she said, was in the perfect time 
period of “women who didn’t 
have Title IX rights and young 
girls who don’t even know about 
it … I am bridging that gap.”

Along with her successes, 

however, Wambach also touched 
on another part of her life —her 
mistakes and regrets.

She 
openly 
spoke 
to 
the 

audience about her mental health 
and alcohol abuse. “After the 
2011 World Cup, I became more 
famous,” she said. But with that 
pressure, 
Wambach 
stumbled 

into a period of severe depression 
and intense substance abuse, that 
she said she kept a secret. As the 
emotions poured out, Wambach 
expressed her deep guilt about a 
DUI that she received this past 
April. She had begun writing 
“Forward” before the incident, 
but “the book took on a life of it’s 
own and I had to tell my story,” 
she said.

With little girls sitting front 

and center, looking at Wambach, 
she 
earnestly 
shared, 
“(The 

DUI) was the best thing that 
ever happened to me, but I’m not 
going to make the same mistake 
two times.” Her vulnerability 
and courageous persona was also 
portrayed in certain chapters of 
her memoir like “Depressive,” 
“Addict” and “Failure,” which 
she said are names that have been 
given to her through the years. 
She said writing this book, of 
both the ups and the downs, was 
“cathartic and healing.”

Within her memoir, Wambach 

described 
in 
supreme 
detail 

moments on the field, including 
specific players that she faced, 
what goals she scored during 
which games and, of course, her 
most impactful memories. Some 
of these memories were not even 
during the games, but were the 
moments where she wrote that 
she “created relationships” and 
“the 
post-game 
locker 
room 

after winning those medals.” 
Recollections like this supported 
Wambach’s motto that there is 
more to life than soccer.

“All the labels that we give 

ourselves don’t matter,” she 
said. “The only label I really care 
about is ‘Human.’ ”

Wambach 
concluded 
that 

her next big goal is to break 
barriers 
of 
segregation 
and 

discrimination 
(especially 

women’s and LGBTQ rights) and, 
mainly, to enjoy her retirement 
as non-soccer-playing Abby.

The night ended with a Q&A 

from the audience and a book 
signing.

“What is your advice to 

the next generation of soccer 
players?” a young boy asked.

“One, (the competition is) 

gonna get harder, so watch the 
game. It will only make you 
better. Two, never let someone 
tell you you’re not good enough 
… it’s not about the end result; 
it’s about the process. Stay in 
the moment. Enjoy it,” Wambach 
answered.

And 
although 
Wambach’s 

memoir explained her progressive 
and audacious success in moving 
forward with her career, Saturday 
night’s event made it clear that 
she understands what it means to 
live for the now, play the game for 
the sake of the game and to never 
let labels define her.

Olympic champion discusses life after soccer and substance 
abuse, generates warm welcome at local Literati bookstore 

“Son of Zorn” ’s pilot isn’t partic-

ularly good. It’s not excruciatingly 
terrible, nor is it some sort of fasci-
nating mess; there’s little to marvel 
at in its pedestrian badness. It’s 
simply an unin-
spiring, mediocre, 
even boring half-
hour of television.

This is some-

what 
surprising, 

given the conceit. 
“Son 
of 
Zorn” 

is a hybrid, live-
action/animated 
comedy 
(think 

“Who 
Framed 

Roger Rabbit?”) starring SNL 
alum Jason Sudeikis (“Sleeping 
With Other People”), Cheryl Hines 
(“Curb Your Enthusiasm”) and Tim 
Meadows (“Popstar: Never Stop 
Never Stopping”). Zorn (Sudei-
kis) is an animated warrior from 
the island of Zephyria (interest-
ingly, this isn’t based on an exist-
ing property), who decides to move 
back to Los Angeles to rekindle his 
relationship with his ex-wife, Edie 
(Hines) and teenage son, Alangu-
lon (Johnny Pemberton, “Neigh-
bors 2”).

That central premise should 

sound dispiritingly familiar to any-
one who’s watched enough televi-
sion. “Zorn” is a collection of tropes 
— the deadbeat dad trying to better 
himself, the fish-out-of-water, the 
white male antihero, etc. — that 

thinks it’s a novel spin on the genre 
simply because of its visual presen-
tation. And while the animation is 
deployed skillfully and creatively 
(the show gets away with a nice, 
winking gag involving a giant bird 
and a sword), the jokes only land 
sporadically.

Furthermore, Zorn looks to be 

the only fully-formed 
character 
worth 

investing in. Sudei-
kis’s 
voice 
acting 

is impressive, even 
bringing 
to 
mind 

Will Arnett’s stellar 
work as a similarly 
bullish 
character 

on “BoJack Horse-
man,” 
but 
Zorn’s 

development almost 

certainly promises to be the same 
redemptive arc we’ve seen in every 
TV show with an absent father. 
Meadows scores a few good laughs 
at the expense of psychologists and 
online professors everywhere, but 
Hines’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” 
comedic brilliance is frustratingly 
underused as a stock ex-wife.

What’s most frustrating, how-

ever, is the general lack of inter-
est in exploring more captivating 
material. Simply transplanting an 
animated character into the most 
well worn of narrative set-ups does 
not a successful story make. “Son 
of Zorn” seems content to mine 
the inherent absurdity of its prem-
ise only in the most surface-level 
ways, rather than fully embracing 
its narrative and comedic poten-
tial. The network sitcom is a dying 

breed in the era of seemingly 
unlimited content, and Fox has 
managed to produce a number of 
the best comedies currently on air, 
but “Zorn” refuses to engage with 
the substance that makes it stand 
out.

Still, Phil Lord and Chris Miller 

(“22 Jump Street”) are executive 
producers, and a few tantalizing 
gags offer their uniquely hilarious, 
whacky and meta sensibility that 
has already led to sitcom gold for 
Fox (“The Last Man On Earth”). 
An intriguing tag at the end of the 
pilot, too, promises a more compel-
ling storyline going forward. But 
rare glimpses of a more absurd and 
surreal show lying restless under-
neath the stifling pilot can’t jus-
tify the intermittently funny slog 
that we’re forced to endure in the 
show’s establishing half-hour.

Reported turmoil behind the 

camera might help explain an 
unexceptional pilot that features 
Jason Sudeikis and Cheryl Hines: 
series creators Reed Agnew and Eli 
Jorné (“Wilfred”) eventually left 
the project midway through pro-
duction due to creative differenc-
es, and Sally McKenna (“Myrtle 
Allen of Ballymaloe”) was brought 
on as the sole showrunner. The 
somewhat awkward mix of stan-
dard sitcom punchlines and more 
visual, understated humor hints 
at some of the tonal inconsistency. 
Perhaps the show the original cre-
ators wanted to make might have 
been more creatively ambitious 
and inspired; the version we’ve got, 
unfortunately, is not.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

“Holy shit. It’s beautiful out 

here,” Ross Gay said, opening his 
reading this past Thursday at 
White Lotus Farms. Such candor 
is characteristic of Gay’s pres-
ence and work, an act of inviting 
the reader in. It is worth men-
tioning that White Lotus Farms 
is exquisite, about seven miles 
off campus, dahlias in bloom, 
the grass almost glowing green 
against the rapid change of a 
twilight sky — nearby, a minia-
ture waterfall rushes steadily.

Gay read at White Lotus 

Farms as part of a reading series 
curated by One Pause Poetry, a 
local non-profit organization 
that seeks to showcase both 
emerging and nationally estab-
lished poets.

His third book of poetry, 

“Catalog of Unabashed Grati-
tude,” from which he read, is 
heavily touched by his green 
thumb. The poet spends much of 
his time gardening in the Bloom-
ington 
Community 
Orchard, 

many of his poems acting as love 
letters to the plants he handles 
as they exist within the context 
of a larger personal and global 
world. Before reading, he cel-
ebrated that even many of the 
weeds and flowers at the farm 
were 
“tremendously 
edible,” 

breaking into a Cheshire Cat 
grin minus the inherent creepi-
ness.

Gay started with what he 

calls “essayettes” or “delights,” 
mini-essays that keep in mind a 
definition of essay as an attempt 
or trial. In his first essayette, 
“Transplanted Figs,” he wrote 
of carrying figs, in all of their 
dirt and funk, through airport 
security. He calls this act “smug-
gling” with a signature touch of 
tenderness, as he declares, “I am 

carrying joy around in my bag.” 
Yet the levity of Gay’s work is 
never boundlessly saccharine. 
It moves to a place of loss that 
exists beside what is typically 
beautiful or delightful. He does 
this often — a small gratitude 
for a specific object or scene 
can travel through memory to a 
moment of hardship or intense 
pain, to return to a larger and 
more encompassing deeply felt 
gratitude.

In another one of his essay-

ettes, he writes of waking up 
from a nightmare, describing a 
disturbing feeling with humor. 
He jokes of a dream in which he 
is chosen to be Hillary Clinton’s 
vice president, poking fun at the 
absurdity of it, while still touch-
ing on the panic and paranoia 
that inadvertently burdens the 
human psyche.

Gay read, “To the Mulberry 

Tree,” a poem that opens with 
a bird “pitching his swill” on 
to the speaker’s face — in less 
poetic terms, a bird taking a 
dump dangerously close to Gay’s 
mouth, an objectively disgusting 
scenario. Yet the poem contin-
ues on with a sweet forgiveness 
and rich nostalgia that travels to 
include a haunt of death beneath 
the aforementioned mulberry 
tree, somehow circling back 
to the lines, “the three of us 
snugged in the canopy / on our 
tippy-toes, gathering fruit / for 
good.”

Gay ended with his title poem, 

a 12- or 13-minute celebration 
that overflows and extends. He 
starts, “friends, will you bear 
with me today…” and the audi-
ence complies. They giggle at yet 
another mention of animal feces 
or moments of the poem that 
are more sensual — “easy tiger 
/ hands to yourself. I am excit-
able” or a reference to “paisley 
panties.” He spouts plant names, 
as if in song, “thank you zin-

nia, and gooseberry, rudbeckia 
/ and papaw, Ashmead’s kernel, 
cockscomb / and scarlet runner, 
feverfew and lemonbalm / thank 
you knitbone and sweetgrass 
and sunchoke.” Readers need 
not be familiar with these plants 
to relish in their sound.

You can hear murmurs and 

gasps as the poem reaches the 
moments of strife amid such 
abundant gratitude. Gay pays 
tribute to his father’s death and 
with a reference to “dreadlocks 
in a drawer,” harnesses the pain 
of the racially charged murder 
of a friend. Gay personifies an 
overgrown arugula plant with 
the phrase “nary a bayonet,” the 
line humming as if an anthem 
that encourages us to, at the very 
least, try to let nature’s beauty 
and the existence of a life-giving 
love soften the blows of the fact 
that that incumbent death lurks 
among it.

As the poem nears its end, 

Gay’s voice rises, becoming more 
emphatic with each breath, and 
he says “give me a minute,” to 
which the dutiful audience com-
plies. Only the sound of a nearby 
stream rushes fills the pause.

So often reminders of a need 

for gratitude suggest the ignor-
ing of that which is dark and 
heavy in our lives. They sug-
gest an ignorant joy or a mold 
that fits only the minds of those 
predisposed to optimism. Ross 
Gay’s work focuses on a grati-
tude that is undoubtedly inclu-
sive of an unjust world, a loss of 
a loved one, a gratitude despite 
the fact that we get dirt under 
our fingernails or that a bird 
may indeed decide to make the 
side of your face its own person-
al restroom. His work and pres-
ence radiate a joy with potential 
to ease what ails us in a celebra-
tion of gratitude that is lyrical, 
humorous and so unabashedly 
growing toward the light.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW


“

As humans, we’re always 
close to destruction. Life 
itself is but a series of close 

calls.”

This is Darius (Keith Stanfield, 

“Short Term 12”), 
roommate, advisor 
and business partner 
to Paper Boi, the ris-
ing rapper on the new 
FX show “Atlanta.” In 
a scene in the second 
episode, the two are 
in a restaurant the 
morning after being 
involved in a shooting. 
While Darius reflects 
on the encounter, 
he’s stacking salt and 
pepper shakers on the table, and, 
as if in response to his thoughts, 
the shaker structure comes tum-
bling down. The subtext is clear: 
anything Paper Boi gains could 
all be taken away from him in an 
instant.

The same week “Atlanta” 

premiered, Bobby Shmurda was 
sentenced to seven years in prison 
after he pled guilty to charges of 
fourth-degree conspiracy and 
second-degree criminal weap-
ons possession. Back in 2014, 
Shmurda rose to fame arguably 
faster than possibly any rapper 
in history, with the then-20-
year-old going viral off a Vine 
from his video for “Hot N*gga.” 
In the Vine, Shmurda tosses up 
his hat (which never seems to 
come down) and breaks into what 
would become famous as the 
“Shmoney Dance.”

Against all traditional wis-

dom, the kind that says that an 
unknown kid can’t get rich off 
a hook-less trap song with the 
n-word right in the title, the 
“Shmoney Dance” blew up. Sud-
denly, the most famous people 
in the world were copying this 
unsigned kid from Brooklyn. 
Beyoncé did it on the On the Run 
tour; Drake did it at the ESPYs; 
NFL player Brandon Gibson did it 

after scoring a touchdown.

“Hot N*igga” is an authen-

tic, pounding track made with 
no record-label input, with no 
melody, from a rapper with zero 

previous buzz. Its 
most famous line is 
Shmurda claiming his 
friend killed someone 
“about a week ago.” 
And yet, the dude 
was on Fallon and 
Kimmel, beaming his 
unrelentingly hard 
sound into millions 
of middle-American 
homes. “Hot N*gga” 
got certified platinum 
and became one of the 

songs of Summer 2014, reaching 
number six on the Billboard Hot 
100 and remaining to this day one 
of the most inexplicable main-
stream successes of all time.

But Shmurda didn’t even get 

six months to enjoy his impossible 
rise to superstardom. In Decem-
ber 2014, he and 14 others were 
arrested in a New York Police 
Department sting. He’s been 
incarcerated ever since. His law-
yer says he’s hopeful that, with 
good behavior, Shmurda will be 
out in three-and-a-half years.

Meanwhile, Jay Z is one of the 

richest and most famous artists of 
his generation, having survived 
an adolescence where he was 
forced to sell crack to support 
himself and successfully avoided 
any kind of arrest that would have 
potentially left him in jail still 
today.

Kanye West, maybe second 

only to Jay in fame and fortune, 
had his breakthrough as a rap-
per after surviving a 2002 car 
crash in which he fell asleep at 
the wheel and shattered his jaw, 
leading to “Through the Wire,” 
his first hit.

Meanwhile, Max B contin-

ues to serve what was initially 
a 75-year prison sentence (since 
reduced). Pimp C is dead from 

purple drank. 2Pac and Biggie 
were both shot and didn’t sur-
vive. Eazy-E died of AIDS, while 
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube have been 
allowed to reinvent themselves 
as a businessman and as a family-
friendly entertainer, respectively.

Life is but a series of close calls, 

especially if you’re a rapper. Suc-
cess comes and goes more quickly 
now than ever in hip hop, and it’s 
obvious that, in addition to talent, 
one needs an unreal amount of 
luck to make a career out of it.

That’s how it is now. Shmurda 

throws his hat up in the air, and 
by the time it comes down he’s 
one of America’s most beloved 
felons. Trinidad James makes the 
iconic “All Gold Everything” and 
the next we hear from him he’s 
broke, dropped from his label and 
watching Netflix. ILoveMakon-
nen has the club going up on a 
Tuesday, and by Wednesday he’s 
retiring from music.

We’ve undeniably been gifted 

with several classic hip-hop 
records in the last few years, but 
still, the machinations of the 
industry seem messier and more 
volatile. “There’s not even any 
money here anymore. It’s all lies,” 
Makonnen told The Fader last 
year. Is there such a thing as too 
much democratization?

As Lil Wayne, who may or may 

not be retired, and who may or 
may not ever be able to release the 
long-awaited Tha Carter V, noted 
in an interview with Jeff Weiss, 
“When I first started doing it, you 
only did it if you wanted to be the 
best. There was no such thing 
as doing it to have a hot song … 
(rappers now are) doing it to be 
known and not for the future and 
not to be incredible or consistency 
or any of that. They doing it for 
someone to know.”

The game has changed, and on 

the surface it seems to give more 
opportunities to young artists, 
but I’m not fully convinced. As 
Wayne points out, when up-and-

coming rappers see that it’s truly

After 
the 
“Ghostbusters” 

reboot failed to match the prec-
edent set by the original, I had 
my reservations with the “Blair 
Witch Project” reboot. The 1999 
film 
pioneered 

the found foot-
age 
technique 

that 
has 
lent 

itself so well to 
the horror genre. 
How innovative 
could the same 
concept 
be 
17 

years later?

Unfortunate-

ly, not very. The movie starts 
with 
college 
student 
James 

(James Allen McCune, “Shame-
less”) finding footage on You-
Tube from his missing sister, 
Heather from the first movie. 
After he discovers the video, his 
friend Lisa (Callie Hernandez, 
“La La Land”) takes on James’s 
search for his sister as a proj-
ect for her documentary film 
class, setting up the plot in a 
way bound to follow the formu-
la from the first film. They are 
guided into the town Heather 
was investigating by the people 
who posted the video, contem-
porary locals Lane (Wes Robin-
son, “State of Affairs”) and Talia 
(Valorie Curry, “House of Lies”). 
The earthly pair live in the deso-
late wilderness and look like a 
mix of “woke” vegan hipsters 
and conspiracy theorists who 
live off the grid. Adding to their 

alternative vibe is their YouTube 
channel dedicated to the Blair 
Witch, driven by their relentless 
research about her on the far 
depths of the internet. They add 
a modern feel to an otherwise 
unimaginative update.

The gang is joined by James’s 

friends, 
accident-

prone Ashley (Corbin 
Reid, “How to Get 
Away with Murder”) 
and skeptical Peter 
(Brandon 
Scott, 

“Wreck-It 
Ralph”), 

and plunge into the 
same forest Heather 
and 
company 
did 

more than a decade 

ago. They are quickly driven to 
their wits’ end as their surround-
ings come after them. While the 
film pays notable attention to 
plot development considering its 
busy cast, it rarely offers some-
thing we didn’t already see in the 
original “Blair Witch.” It tries to 
subvert easy horror film tropes, 
but these twists ultimately prove 
negligible to the plot in the long 
run. Lane and Talia, however, 
keep the movie from becoming 
too predictable by keeping their 
true nature a mystery to the rest 
of the characters; whether they 
actually deserve the authority to 
lead the group is questionable. 
Once the idea that they could be 
bad guys crossed my mind, I sec-
ond-guessed their every deci-
sion, making the resulting action 
that much more exciting.

The special effects are great, 

the one aspect in which this 

modern reboot improved upon 
the original. The witch’s look 
isn’t far far from a stereotypical 
witch, but she’s still disturbing, 
appearing this time as a tower-
ing white demon with a cylindri-
cal body and a menacing scream. 
She’s always seen from a distance 
and in the periphery, because she 
can steal you away if you look 
directly at her. The crashing trees 
threatening to kill the young peo-
ple looking for her and spooky 
apparitions in her disgustingly 
squalid house are vividly brought 
to life. The evil causing the dan-
ger may be vaguely defined, but at 
least it feels palpable.

For a movie that markets itself 

as 
psychological 
horror, 
the 

script leaves much to be desired. 
Too many horror sequences 
are jump scares, with ominous 
noises and trees crashing nearby 
building up to characters pop-
ping out of nowhere and scaring 
one another. While these scares 
work well to keep the characters 
(and audience) in suspense and 
add dramatic tension until the 
climax, they also make the movie 
feel like a perpetual letdown.

Despite being a disappointing 

sequel, “Blair Witch” is an enjoy-
able movie that goes down easy 
for the faint of heart. The sur-
real moments where the witch 
is allowed to demonstrate her 
full power are truly unnerving 
and make the whole thing feel 
worth it, even when its attempts 
to build a realistic narrative “on 
camera” from the beginning 
feels stale.

Lionsgate


By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Most Michigan fans already knew that 

redshirt sophomore linebacker Jabrill 
Peppers was the football equivalent of 
a Swiss Army knife, but Saturday’s win 
over Colorado might have been the finest 
example of just how much he can do.

Playing all three phases for the first 

time this season, Peppers picked up 
a career-high 204 all-purpose yards, 
nine tackles (a career-high 3.5 for loss), 
a sack and a fourth-quarter 54-yard 
punt return touchdown that almost 
felt like an inevitability after all he had 
accomplished to that point in the game.

“Above it all, Jabrill Peppers proved 

he was the best player today, in today’s 
game,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh. “We don’t win that game 

without Jabrill Peppers.”

After the Buffaloes jumped out to a 21-7 

lead in the first quarter, it was Peppers 
who almost single-handedly kept the 
Wolverines in the game. Returning both 
kickoffs and punts, Peppers racked up 
170 return yards and gave Michigan great 
field position on nearly all of its drives.

He was even more of a force on 

defense as one of the highlighted players 
in defensive coordinator Don Brown’s 
blitz-heavy scheme. Harbaugh has often 
said that Peppers is capable of getting to 
a quarterback in less than a second, and 
he did just that when he ran unblocked 
through the line of scrimmage and 
dropped Colorado backup quarterback 
Steven Montez to the turf for an 11-yard 
sack late in the third quarter.

“He really showed you his toughness, 

his athleticism,” Harbaugh said. “Some 

hits that were momentum-changing hits 
in this game.”

Redshirt 
sophomore 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight has seen plenty of 
Peppers on defense in practice, and he 

said Saturday that he was just thankful 
that quarterbacks aren’t “live” during 
fall camp so Peppers couldn’t actually hit 
him.

Speight later added that he has never 

played with or against anyone that can be 
as much of a force on all sides of the ball 
as Peppers can.

“I think every single thought he has 

is just about destroying the opponent,” 
Speight said. “He’s got that mindset that 
few people do. I think every single play he 
wants to chop someone in half and make 
sure that they can’t walk for a couple 
minutes.”

While Peppers didn’t do much playing 

offense for the first time this season 
(two carries, 24 yards), Speight thinks 
Peppers’ vision and cutting ability make 
it reasonable to compare him to Stanford 
running back Christian McCaffrey.

The play Peppers looked most like 

McCaffrey, however, was on his first-
ever special-teams touchdown in the 
fourth quarter. With a wide open hole in 
the middle of the field, Peppers broke one 

tackle and made another defender miss 
before scampering into the left side of the 
end zone, bringing Michigan’s lead up to 
the final score of 45-28. It was the final 
big blow to the Buffaloes, and it lifted a 
monkey off Peppers’ back after he came 
up just short of the end zone on many 
returns both this season and last.

“It was definitely a sense of relief,” 

Peppers said. “I felt like a couple of those 
punts I could have had — I could’ve 
taken one back. But (Colorado is) a great 
tackling team, they were shooting the 
hip, wrapping up. But when you get a 
line drive and great blocking, if you don’t 
score then, they gotta put somebody 
else back there. That’s just how I felt. 
The hole was wide open. … I started 
cramping about the five (yard line), but I 
was like, ‘There’s no way I’m not getting 
in this time.’ ”

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Michigan’s comeback answers the call
T

he question wasn’t 
finished when Wilton 
Speight cut it off.

Standing 

in the Crisler 
Center media 
room for a 
postgame 
press 
conference, 
Speight had 
his elbow 
and shoulder 
wrapped 
after an 
especially 
tough game.

“Is this a team,” a reporter 

started, “that, two years ago, or 
even last year, would have been 
equipped to fight through —”

“Fold?” Speight asked.
A few hours earlier, Speight 

and his team had gone down 
14-0, and then 21-7, in the first 
quarter against Colorado. By 
the start of the second quarter, 
the Buffaloes had the ball, the 
momentum and 110,000 fans 
sweating for the first time this 
season.

The pressure was all 

on Michigan, and Speight 
pinpointed the question of that 
moment perfectly. Would the 
Wolverines fold? Already?

The previous nine times 

Michigan trailed by 14 or more, 
the answer was yes. In fact, 
the last time the Wolverines 
came back from a deficit of 14 
was September 2013, against 
Connecticut.

The tension that elicited was 

palpable in the student section 
Saturday. It spilled over into 
vocal frustration. But it didn’t 
turn into full-on panic. Trailing 
21-7 in the second quarter, 
fans wondered aloud “what is 
happening?” and “what the f*** 
was that?”

Senior Mitch Trost was in 

the thick of the crowd as it 
unfolded, and he captured the 
sentiment as well as anyone.

“We’ve all been hoping for 

something better, so we’re all 
expecting better,” Trost said. 
“And then when (Colorado went 
up early), we’re all like, (we) 
don’t want to be reminded of 
the Hoke years.”

But, Trost added, “I still 

have hope.”

It was still 21-7 as Trost 

spoke. He insisted he wouldn’t 
resign to defeat until the 
Wolverines had lost. As 
tempting as it could have 
been to turn pessimistic, 
he wouldn’t. But he had to 
concede, “I didn’t think they’d 
come out swinging so hard.”

Minutes later, the Buffaloes 

lined up to punt. One voice 

yelled out, “Block this punt, 
let’s do it!” And they did, sort of. 
Colorado punter Alex Kinney 
fired it too low 
and deflected 
it off one of his 
own players. 
But the effect 
was the same. 
Michigan took 
possession at 
the Buffaloes’ 
38-yard line, 
and fans 
continued 
willing the 
team down the field.

“Booty, booty, booty,” one 

yelled, just before Speight found 
senior tight end Jake Butt for 

21 yards. On the next play, 
fifth-year senior receiver Jehu 
Chesson ran the ball into the 

end zone on a 
sweep.

By now, you 

know the rest. 
Michigan 
added a field 
goal and then 
took the lead 
on a 45-yard 
touchdown 
reception by 
fifth-year 
senior Amara 

Darboh. Colorado briefly 
regained control at the start 
of the third quarter, scoring 
on a 70-yard touchdown pass, 

but it was all Wolverines from 
then on. After trailing at one 
point by 14, Michigan won, 
45-28, providing an answer to 
the question in Speight’s press 
conference.

“That’s just from this 

coaching staff coming in and 
building a callus,” Speight 
later explained. “Coach always 
talks about building a callus 
and being tough, and we didn’t 
really let it faze us. I never 
really said, ‘Oh wow, we’re 
down by (14).’ Like, ‘Oh gosh, 
these guys are giving us a good 
game.’ It was just, ‘This is fun. 
This is an opportunity to be in 
a game.’

“The first two we played 

weren’t that fun come the 
fourth quarter, because it was 
already over.”

Be it the team or the fans, 

there’s no doubt Harbaugh has 
instilled a confidence in the 
last 19 months. It’s a confidence 
born from expectations, and at 
this point, for this team, that’s 
not a bad thing.

Around the country, many 

of the nation’s top teams 
have been tested early. No. 5 
Clemson was held close by Troy 
last week. No. 6 Houston was in 
a tough one against Cincinnati 
before it pulled away late 
Saturday, and No. 1 Alabama 
needed a big comeback to beat 
Ole Miss.

Like those teams, Michigan 

passed the test and survived, 
and it now enters Big Ten play 
undefeated.

To be fair, the Buffaloes 

aren’t at the level of the Rebels, 
and they further exposed 
the Wolverines’ deep-play 
weakness. They forced Speight 
into his worst game of the 
season. But as Butt was quick 
to point out after the game, 
the season wasn’t going to be a 
fairytale from start to finish.

Now on the cusp of Big 

Ten play, the tests aren’t 
stopping anytime soon. Eight 
of the Wolverines’ next nine 
opponents are ranked higher 
than Colorado in Bill Connelly’s 
S&P+ ratings this week. 
Michigan tops those ratings, 
a sign that this is a team that’s 
come a long way since two or 
three years ago.

It proved that with 

Saturday’s comeback. The 
Wolverines didn’t fold. They 
punched back and they stood on 
their callus.

Now, they’ll see how long it 

can hold.

WOMEN’S ROWING
‘M’ cruises by Eastern Michigan

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

BELLEVILLE 
– 
Around 

9:40 
Sunday 
morning, 
a 

group 
of 
Michigan 
and 

Eastern Michigan fans had 
bunched around the outside of 
Michigan’s boathouse. A few 
of them had edged out to the 
lake and were well into a quiet 
game of fetch in the water with 
a couple of dogs.

But at about 9:50, the voices 

of five different coxswains could 
be heard breaking the quiet — 
four of which belonged to the 
Michigan women’s rowing team.

The Wolverines began their 

season this past Saturday in an 
unscored workout scrimmage 
against Eastern Michigan at 
their home course on Belleville 
Lake. Michigan brought four 
different lineups, all eights, 
while the Eagles brought a 
single eight boat. The event was 
a head race, where the boats 

have a staggered start and the 
winner is gauged by time and 
not a finish line.

It 
was 
a 
non-scoring 

scrimmage, but the Wolverines 
dominated 
the 
event, 
even 

though they’ve had less than 
two weeks of practice. The 
2V8 finished first in every race, 
followed by either the 1V8 or 
3V8. Eastern Michigan finished 
last in every race except for the 
first, where it edged out the 
fourth Michigan boat by less 
than a second.

“I think it was really good 

because we didn’t really know 
how the Michigan boats would 
stack up against Eastern or how 
we would stack up against each 
other,” said senior starboard 
Sarah Hudnall, who was a 
member of the 2V8 crew. “It 
was really good to just go out 
and race.”

The Wolverines have been 

working on speed and updating 
their rhythm, and this race was a 

good chance for them to test where 
they are in a competitive setting.

“You could tell that everyone 

was working really hard,” Hudnall 
said. “We started in different 
orders every time, so it was a good 
chance to stay in good position — 
so if you were in the back, it was 
a good chance to try to get in the 
front, and if you were in the front 
it was a good opportunity to try to 
hold your spot.”

With just three additional 

races scheduled for the fall 
— Ohio State, Head of the 
Charles, and a novice-only race 
with Michigan State — this 
scrimmage puts the team in a 
good position to finish out its fall 
season in high standing.

“I thought it went good,” said 

Michigan coach Mark Rothstein. 
“I thought we did a pretty good 
job of applying what we learned 
in practice and I think that like 
every team we have a lot to work 
on, but I like what I’ve seen from 
this team so far.”

Michigan can thank 
its defense for win

O

ut of the rush of an 
announced crowd 
of 110,042 to leave 

Michigan 
Stadium 
after the 
game 
Saturday 
night, many 
of them 
having 
watched 
fourth-
quarter 
football for 
the first time 
this season, a lone voice made 
itself heard:

“Thank goodness for the 

defense.”

Yes indeed. If the Michigan 

football team’s defense hadn’t 
stepped up and sidelined 
Colorado’s red-hot offense 
for the final three quarters of 
Saturday’s game, the Wolverines 
very likely would have lost 
a shocker to the Buffaloes, 
derailing a promising early 
season. Instead, Michigan 
survived and advanced, 45-28, 
finishing a comfortable non-
conference schedule at 3-0.

It’s not often that a defense 

allowing 28 points in a game is an 
asset, especially one of Michigan’s 
standard. The unit began 
Saturday as the scapegoat, having 
allowed two easy touchdowns in 
the first three possessions. But 
Colorado missed a field goal on its 
next drive, and that was the only 
window the Wolverines needed. 
They kept firing fresh bullets, 
and the Buffaloes were all out of 
ammunition.

Once again, the defense set 

the tone for the comeback, with 
an assist from the special teams. 
Michigan’s first touchdown 
came on a blocked punt returned 
for a touchdown. Its second 
came when the defense — and 
another long punt return by 
Jabrill Peppers — created 
starting field position on 
Colorado’s 38-yard line, from 

which the offense needed just 
two plays to score.

That was another spark. After 

that, the Wolverines reached 
the red zone on their next 
four possessions, scoring two 
touchdowns and a field goal and 
building a lead they wouldn’t 
relinquish. But again, the 
defense started the run.

It’s more common for a high-

flying offense to put enough 
points on the board to keep 
scores close. But in Michigan’s 
case, the defense plays that role.

“I don’t think we’re ever out of 

the fight,” said fifth-year senior 
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow. 
“…They played really hard, and 
hats off to them for that. But I 
think with our defense and the 
talent we have and how hard 
we play, I think we’re gonna 
overmatch them in the long run.”

Almost no offenses can keep 

Michigan at bay for an entire 
game. Last year, the Wolverines 
lost three games. Against Utah 
and Michigan State, their 
defense gave up 17 and 21 points, 
respectively, both of which 
should be few enough to win 
the game. Against Ohio State, 
it wasn’t as much a case of the 
Buckeyes wearing Michigan 
down as it was of them being a 
better team.

To beat Michigan’s defense, 

you have to play more than a 
quarter, and Colorado managed 
only one big play after that, a 
70-yard touchdown pass on a post 
route from Sefo Liufau to Shay 
Fields early in the third quarter.

“I think all the trick plays 

kind of caught us off guard at 
first, but once they used their 
bag of tricks and we settled into 
the game and we got to play our 
game, I think that’s when the 
tide turned,” Glasgow said.

On the next series, Liufau 

left the game with an injury, 
effectively ending the Buffaloes’ 
chances against the Wolverines’ 
defense.

Thus, Michigan found its 

escape, and it wasn’t much more 
than that. In the future, this 
game will sit in the record books 
as a harmless 17-point victory 
over another inferior opponent, 
and Saturday’s performance will 
be good enough.

But this is not the future. 

Today there is a more pressing 
problem, and that is that the 
Wolverines weren’t nearly ready 
to play at the outset. Colorado 
blitzed Michigan for 21 points 
in the first quarter, piling up 
yardage as it wished as the 
defense missed tackles left and 
right. Only after the Wolverines 
settled in did the talent 
advantage begin to matter.

“It was a fight,” said Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh. “They 
knew it was a fight. … Every 
football game that (has) ever 
been played, probably ever will 
be played, it’s a battle, seeing 
who the best players are in the 
football game.”

Those players Saturday were 

the Wolverines, and they fought 
long enough for it to come down 
to that. Next time, they know 
they may not be as fortunate.

“If you get in that situation, 

different time, different place, 
you never know if you can 
come back,” Glasgow said. 
“Coach Harbaugh gave us 
the advice last night: There’s 
always praise for the guy who 
gets backed into the corner 
and fights his way out, but the 
best way to fight your way out 
is never get backed into the 
corner. And we did today. We 
were lucky enough to come 
back. We played hard enough 
to come back. But we don’t 
want to find ourselves in that 
situation again this season.”

Now, Michigan is undefeated 

and moving on having survived 
a close call. For that, it has the 
defense to thank.

‘M’ pounds MSU, CMU

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

It took just over one minute for 

the No. 8 Michigan field hockey 
team to get on the board against 
Central Michigan on Sunday.

With 
the 
Wolverines 
on 

the 
attack, 
senior 
forward 

Sina Lampe fired a pass into 
the crease, finding the stick 
of senior forward Courtney 
Enge, who deflected it past the 
Chippewa goalkeeper.

Enge’s 
goal 
opened 
the 

floodgates for the Wolverines 
(1-0 Big Ten, 6-1 overall), 
who displayed their offensive 
prowess during a 10-0 rout 
of Central Michigan (1-6) — 
Michigan’s second win of the 
weekend after a 4-1 triumph 
over 
Michigan 
State 
(0-1, 

4-3) in the conference opener 
Friday night.

The 
Chippewas 
hardly 

challenged 
the 
Wolverines, 

who tallied 34 shots and 12 
corners. Michigan controlled 
possession 
and 
generated 

scoring opportunities at will 
— though it initially struggled 
with finishing its chances.

Despite spending most of the 

first half threatening to score, 
Michigan tacked on only one 
other goal when redshirt junior 
midfielder Allie Sardo scored 
off a corner.

“After 
coming 
in 
from 

halftime, we had to figure out 
what our mojo was and what 
our passing game was,” Enge 
said. “Getting it down the line 
and into the circle are really 
good things for us, and it was 
just going to take time to finish.”

Finishing wasn’t as much of a 

problem in the second half — the 
Wolverines scored eight times 
to turn the game into a blowout, 
with four coming in the first 10 
minutes of the half.

“In the first half we were 

frantic a little bit when we were 
in the circle,” Enge said. “In the 
second half, we were able to get 

the ball on the stick and figure 
out what we were going to do 
with it next.”

Added 
Michigan 
coach 

Marcia Pankratz: “It takes a 
little bit longer for the attack to 
be firing on all cylinders, so we 
just needed to stay patient and 
continue to try to execute and 
that was what we talked about 
at halftime.

“We have the saying, ‘Slow is 

smooth and smooth is fast,’ and 
(I told them), ‘Make sure you 
just finish your chances,’ and 
that worked out in the second 
half a lot better.”

With 
Michigan’s 
offense 

holding the ball for most of 
the game, the backline didn’t 
face much pressure. Central 
Michigan 
was 
unable 
to 

generate any shots or corners 
until the final seconds of the 
second half.

It was a slightly different 

story 
Friday 
against 
the 

Spartans, but the Wolverines 
still emerged with a relatively 
easy 4-1 victory.

Michigan State tallied 10 

shots, scoring a goal in the first 
half and forcing junior goalie 
Sam Swenson to make five 
saves. Yet the Wolverines held 
a lead throughout the contest, 
avenging a 5-3 preseason loss to 
the Spartans.

“Preseason, 
we 
(were) 

still working on some things, 
working 
on 
lineups 
and 

personnel, and I think we 
played with a lot more energy 
and 
organization 
(Friday),” 

Pankratz said. “We contested 
a lot more plays than we did in 
the preseason.

“When 
we 
get 
circle 

penetrations, we have to be able 
to finish. With Sam being in 

our goal cage and being such an 
extraordinary goalie, putting in 
four goals is going to bode well 
for us.”

It bodes well even more so 

for Michigan, considering its 
defense has surrendered a total 
of four goals in seven games, 
with Swenson already posting 
two shutouts. 

Still, even coming off a game 

in which her team scored 10 
goals, Pankratz knows there’s 
still room for improvement 
in the young Wolverines — 
especially as their schedule 
increases in difficulty.

“Ohio State, Penn State and 

the Big Ten ratchets up your 
ability to have to make decisions 
quickly,” Pankratz said. “So (we 
need to make) free hits quicker, 
(make) decisions quicker and 
just (do) everything we did 
today at a higher level.”

Wolverines fall again

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — Nearing 

the end of Sunday’s Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 
game 
against 

Michigan 
State, 
freshman 
forward 
Jack Hallahan sent a soaring 
cross into the box. The ball was 
knocked back and forth several 
times by Wolverine attackers, 
but 
eventually 
the 
Spartans 

cleared the ball harmlessly away 
— marking yet another time 
Michigan was close, but could 
not get the finishing touch it 
desperately needed.

The lone Spartan goal came 

eight minutes into the game, on 
a deflected header that landed 
right at the feet of Michigan State 
defender Brad Centala, who did 
not miss the golden opportunity 
to smash the ball into the open net.

From 
that 
point 
on, 
the 

Wolverines 
(0-3-0 
Big 
Ten, 

0-4-3 overall) played catch-up. 
They won the time of possession 
battle handily, controlling the 
ball for the majority of the 
game, tactically seeking their 
opportunity for the equalizer. 
But to the displeasure of the 
Michigan faithful who made the 
trek to East Lansing, that moment 
never came, and Michigan State 
(2-0-0, 5-1-0) took the game, 1-0.

The 
Wolverines 
showed 

patience in their style of play, 
which 
was 
countered 
by 
a 

fast-break style offense for the 
Spartans, who got most of their 
chances on quick rushes. However, 
junior goaltender Evan Louro 
handled the rest of the Spartan 
attacks, with the help of a shot off 
the post and a save by sophomore 
defender Marcello Borges. 

It 
was 
up 
to 
Michigan’s 

controlled style of offense to 
strike back. The first half came 
and went with only one quality 
chance for the Wolverines, which 
came on a cross from redshirt 
junior 
midfielder 
Michael 

Kapitula with less than a minute 
remaining. Sophomore midfielder 
Robbie Mertz headed the ball 
on goal, but the Michigan State 
goalkeeper made his best save 
of the game, sliding to keep the 
Wolverines off the board. 

“Down 1-0 early is always 

tough and you never plan for 
that,” said senior midfielder Brett 
Nason. “We had to be more attack-
oriented and try to push numbers 
forward, and we’re going to give 
up a little defensively of course, 
but we have to get that goal back.”

To open the second half, 

the Spartans slowed down as 
Michigan pushed its offense. 
However, 
Michigan 
coach 

Chaka Daley points to at least 
five opportunities where the 
Wolverines could have scored, 
but didn’t break through.

Within the last 10 minutes, 

the Wolverines put forth a last-
ditch effort to tie the game, but 
even moving a defender up and 
subbing in fresh legs didn’t help 
them convert.

“Margins in college soccer 

are so slim,” Daley said. “You 
have situations where the ball is 
bouncing around the box, theirs 
goes in, ours doesn’t — that’s 
college soccer.”

Added Nason: “It’s not like we’re 

doing anything wrong. It’s just that 
luck hasn’t been on our side.”

On the final play of the game, 

with 15 seconds remaining, senior 
defender Lars Eckenrode found 
himself alone in the box as he 
juggled the ball to himself, and 
booted the ball on the net. The 
shot soared just high of the goal, 
and his impassioned scream of 
agony was echoed by the rest of 
his Michigan teammates as they 
watched the Spartans celebrate 
with the Big Bear trophy for the 
first time since 2013.

But the winless Wolverines 

still have faith in their abilities.

“Honestly, I don’t think we 

played poorly, so you can’t put your 
head down,” Nason said. “You 
can’t hide from it — you just have 
to come out next game stronger.”

Michigan 2-0 in Big Ten

Michigan goes 
on road for first 

conference weekend, 
tops Iowa, Nebraska 

By ROBERT HEFTER 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s soccer 

team made its Big Ten debut this 
weekend at Iowa on Friday and 
Nebraska on Sunday, swiftly 
prevailing over both teams to 
increase its conference record to 
2-0 (2-0 Big Ten, 6-1-1 overall). 
The Wolverines put their stout 
defense on display yet again, 
allowing only one goal in the past 
two games.

At Iowa, Michigan outshot the 

Hawkeyes, 16-5, in the first half, 
but failed to convert any of those 
chances into goals. 

At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 

second half, though, sophomore 
midfielder Abby Kastroll buried 
the ball through a scrum off of a 
free kick to give the Wolverines 
a 1-0 lead. 

“We utilize free kicks because 

we work on them every day,” 
said sophomore forward Reilly 
Martin. “We try to execute and 
get our heads on each cross.”

Iowa gained momentum in 

the second half, though, letting 
seven shots fly opposed to 
Michigan’s five.

Sophomore goalkeeper Sarah 

Jackson amassed five saves, 
maintaining the clean sheet. The 
Wolverines would go on to win 
the match 1-0.

“We’re taking every game day 

by day,” said junior midfielder 
and 
captain 
Ani 
Sarkisian. 

“This weekend was a hard road 
trip with a quick multi-state 
turnaround.”

Michigan 
continued 
its 

conference play at Nebraska, 
hoping to increase its shutout 
streak to five in a row. 

“Nebraska 
and 
Iowa 
play 

very different games. Nebraska 
is aggressive,” said Michigan 
coach Greg Ryan. “Our focus 
was defending well as a group, 
and we did a great job of limiting 

Nebraska’s chances to score.”

After 28 minutes of play in the 

first half, Martin was fouled in 
the box, giving the Wolverines a 
penalty kick chance to take the 
lead. Martin capitalized on it, 
firing it into the left corner of 
the net.

With a one-goal lead, the 

Wolverines focused on their 
defense, something they set out 
to achieve considering Nebraska’s 
aggressive attack, which averages 
10.1 shots per game. 

Nebraska 
nearly 
converted 

during the beginning of the 
second half as junior goalkeeper 
Megan Hinz tipped a potential 
equalizer over the net. However, 
just four minutes later, Kastroll 

netted an insurance goal off of 
a pass through the center of the 
defense from Sarkisian to put the 
Wolverines up by two.

Just as the prospect of five 

straight shutouts was in sight, 
Nebraska scored a header from 
a corner kick with eight seconds 
remaining in regulation. The 
Wolverines went on to win, 2-1.

The 
Cornhuskers 
outshot 

the Wolverines, 13-6, but the 
Michigan defense dominated the 
game, and the coaches awarded 
the whole unit the Player of the 
Game award.

Michigan looks to continue 

its Big Ten win streak against 
Michigan State at home next 
Saturday.

WOMEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ wins home invite

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

Mark Rosen had never seen 

anything like it in his 18 years as 
Michigan’s coach.

According to the Michigan 

volleyball team’s coach, Friday 
night’s packed and energetic 
crowd at Cliff Keen Arena 
reached a decibel level that set 
the tone for the Wolverines (11-
1) throughout the three matches 
of the Michigan Challenge.

No. 23 Michigan swept the 

tournament, claiming victories 
in all three matchups and 
dropping only one set — the 
first set against Colgate (4-7) on 
Saturday night.

On 
Friday 
night 
against 

Auburn (6-7), the Wolverines 
downed the Tigers handily 
and 
held 
an 
advantage 
in 

almost every facet of the game, 
especially on the offensive side. 
Spearheaded by senior middle 
blocker Abby Cole, who had 13 
kills, Michigan won the kills 
battle, 48-33, in a 3-0 sweep.

Michigan’s front row for 

most of the match, composed of 
Cole and middle blockers Cori 
Crocker and Claire Kieffer-
Wright, 
were 
in 
complete 

harmony and accounted for 
more than half the team’s kills.

Saturday’s 
early 
matchup 

against 
Eastern 
Michigan 

(5-8) was much of the same 
as the previous contest. The 
Wolverines took control from 
the get-go to take their second 
3-0 victory.

Rosen dug deep into the 

depth chart against the Eagles 
to give his typical starters a 
breather before the third game 
later on Saturday. But evidenced 
by the score, Michigan didn’t 
skip a beat.

“It was to get some people some 

experience, to see some people in 
different situations,” Rosen said. 
“If there’s only six or seven players 
who can play at a high level, you’re 
not going at a level that’s going to 
make you better.”

Freshman 
outside 
hitter 

Sydney Wetterstrom and fifth-
year 
senior 
outside 
hitters 

Kelly Murphy and Ally Davis 
combined for 19 kills against 

Eastern Michigan.

Saturday’s 
nightcap 
against 

Colgate began much differently 
than the previous two matchups 
for Michigan. The Raiders took 
control of the first set, winning 
25-22, to jump out to an early lead.

But the set quickly became 

an outlier of an impressive 
weekend for the Wolverines, 
as they managed to control the 
tempo for the rest of the match.

Michigan 
roared 
back, 

trouncing Colgate in the third 
set, 25-9. Cole, once again, was 
the star of the match, tallying an 
impressive 19 kills.

“I thought the difference was 

in the third and fourth set,” 
Rosen said. “Our defensive level 
took a big jump, our blockers 
finally made the adjustments, 
we started to cap on their 
hitters and then it changed the 
game. They hit -.187 in the third 
set, and that’s exactly what we 
were hoping to do.”

The sweep at the Michigan 

Challenge 
capped 
off 
an 

impressive 11-1 start for the 

Wolverines in non-conference 
play. 
In 
all 
three 
games, 

freshmen MacKenzi Welsh and 
Tiffany Clark made promising 
contributions on an already 
young team, but for Rosen, it 
was the seniors who impressed 
him the most.

“(The freshmen) are good, 

but I think I’m most proud of 
the three seniors,” Rosen said. 
“Those older kids have put a lot 
of time and work in, and I think 
they’re doing a great job of the 
volleyball side of it, but also the 
leadership and the intangibles.”

While the Wolverines have 

reason to celebrate after their 
dominant non-conference play, 
they also know that games in 
the Big Ten — which boasts 
eight teams in the top 25 — will 
pose a much greater challenge.

“We feel really good,” Cole 

said. “It’s definitely a confidence 
booster, but at the same time we 
understand it’s not going to be 
much like this (against the Big 
Ten). We have a lot to work on 
this week in practice.”

Mark Rosen’s team won three matches this weekend to move to 11-1.

Five Things We Learned: Colorado

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

When the Michigan football 

team faced its first Power Five 
opponent 
of 
the 
season 
on 

Saturday 
against 
Colorado, 

most fans probably expected 
to see a few flaws emerge in 
the Wolverines. Granted, they 
probably didn’t expect them to 
go down 14-0 and 21-7 in the 
first quarter, but superior talent 
prevailed in the end, as Michigan 
outscored the Buffaloes, 38-7, in 
the final three quarters to take a 
decisive 45-28 victory.

Still, 
the 
fourth-ranked 

Wolverines (3-0) now look like 
a team with considerably more 
weaknesses than it showed the 
last two weeks. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh has said his 
favorite weeks are ones where 
the Wolverines win comfortably 
and still have things they can 
improve. This week, he’ll have 
that chance again.

Here are five things we learned 

from 
Michigan’s 
final 
non-

conference game of the season.

1. Jabrill Peppers is no longer 

an “almost” guy.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

linebacker Jabrill Peppers has 
been touted as a lethal threat in 
all three phases of the game since 
before he arrived on campus. 
And though he starred as a 
safety, return man and offensive 
weapon for the Wolverines in 
2015, he failed to record a special 
teams touchdown in his first full 
collegiate season.

That weight was lifted off 

Peppers’ back Saturday, when he 
dodged two tacklers and took a 
54-yard punt return to the house 
in the fourth quarter. After a 
number of potential touchdowns 
came up short over the last 
year — he says being tackled by 
Minnesota’s punter last season 
still “haunts” him — Peppers 
expressed relief after the game 

to no longer be considered “an 
‘almost’ kind of guy.” The score 
was the icing on the cake for 
Peppers in a game in which he 
tallied 204 all-purpose yards and 
3.5 tackles for loss.

2. Michigan’s secondary is 
beatable without Jourdan 

Lewis.

Through 
the 
first 
two 

games without injured senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis, the 
Wolverines’ secondary looked 
more than capable of making 
up for his absence. But when 
Colorado came to Ann Arbor 
with a flock of talented receivers, 
things took a turn for the worse 
for Michigan’s defensive backs.

After 
doing 
a 
great 
job 

protecting the deep ball against 

Hawaii and Central Florida, the 
Wolverines allowed a 50-yard 
pass to Bryce Bobo, a 37-yard 
touchdown to Devin Ross (who 
scored twice) and a 70-yard 
strike to Shay Fields. And it 
wasn’t 
one 
single 
Michigan 

player being targeted the entire 
afternoon — senior cornerback 
Channing Stribling, fifth-year 
senior Jeremy Clark and senior 
safeties Dymonte Thomas and 
Delano Hill all were beaten at 
different times.

For the first time all season, 

the Wolverines really missed 
Lewis’ All-American presence 
on the field.

3. The offensive line has plenty 

of room for improvement.

After struggling to protect 

the run last week against a 
heavily stacked box by Central 
Florida, Michigan’s offensive 
line had trouble with pass 
blocking this week. Redshirt 
sophomore 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight got through 
his first two games as a starter 
relatively pain-free, but he was 
constantly under duress in the 
first quarter against Colorado. 
Speight was sacked three times 
and appeared rattled early on, 
completing just three of his 
first 12 passes and totaling just 
25 yards.

He ultimately settled down, 

throwing for 229 yards, a 
touchdown and no interceptions 
(despite a number of passes that 
made contact with defenders), 
but he certainly could have 
benefitted from some better 

pass protection.

On the flip side, the Wolverines’ 

run game was markedly better, 
as senior running back De’Veon 
Smith broke free for a 42-yard 
touchdown and the backs tallied 
168 yards as a group, even with 
the 22 yards lost by Speight sacks. 
Michigan has the talent to beat 
teams even if the ground game or 
passing game is neutralized, but 
an improved offensive line might 
help the Wolverines craft a more 
balanced attack.

4. The kicking unit’s rhythm 

needs fine-tuning.

After fifth-year senior Kenny 

Allen had an uncharacteristically 
poor game on Saturday, going 
1-for-3 on field goals and booting 
a few below-average punts early, 

it was apparent that something 
was slightly off with Michigan’s 
kicking unit.

After the game, Harbaugh 

pointed 
to 
a 
slight 
timing 

problem, also mentioning that 
redshirt junior Scott Sypniewski 
might have overcompensated for 
a few high snaps in warmups by 
snapping the ball too low during 
the game.

“Go back and look at it, but 

(since last year) our operation 
with the snap, hold, and the kick 
has been as good as any in college 
football,” Harbaugh said. “The 
snap’s been over the spot, laces at 
6:00, ball through the middle of 
the upright on the kick.

“Today it was off. Snaps were 

low, laces were at 12 (o’clock), 
Kenny was hot and cold a little 
bit on kicks — kickoffs and punts, 
and the kicks.”

5. BOLD PREDICTION: 

Peppers scores an offensive 
touchdown and special teams 
touchdown in the same game 

this season.

Since Peppers first committed 

to Michigan in 2013, he has 
drawn comparisons to another 
elite three-way player for the 
Wolverines: 
former 
Heisman 

Trophy winner and likely future 
NFL Hall of Famer Charles 
Woodson. And Saturday night, 
Speight 
compared 
Peppers’ 

offensive skills to an elite runner 
and return specialist, Stanford’s 
Christian McCaffrey.

Now that Peppers has scored 

a special teams touchdown and 
played offense for the first time 
this season, he could be poised 
to achieve one of McCaffrey’s 
biggest accomplishments: scoring 
in multiple phases in the same 
game. If Harbaugh uses Peppers 
on offense in big games like he 
did last season — and if Peppers 
adopts Woodson’s flair for the 
dramatic — the feat could come 
against a huge rival like Michigan 
State or Ohio State.

Michigan’s offensive line struggled with pass blocking Saturday’s against Colorado, allowing three sacks, including one that forced a fumble returned for a touchdown.

Stingy third-down defense lifts ‘M’

Wolverines limit 

Colorado to 1-for-13 

on third down

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

It comes with a caveat, but 

here’s Michigan’s stat of the 
night, 
(non-Jabrill 
Peppers 

division): 
1-for-13. 
That 

was 
Colorado’s 
third-down 

conversion rate — the only 
success 
was 
a 
meaningless 

third-and-2 in the final minute 
— and it’s a big reason the 
fourth-ranked 
Wolverines 

emerged from Saturday’s game 
unscathed.

Colorado 
was 
billed 
as 

Michigan’s first test of the 
season, and it was. Behind the 
same big-play bursts Central 
Florida used to great success a 
week ago, the Buffaloes built 

leads of 14-0 and 21-7 in the first 
quarter to put a scare into an 
announced crowd of 110,042 at 
Michigan Stadium.

Were it not for a blocked punt 

returned for a touchdown by 
sophomore wide receiver Grant 
Perry, it would have been worse 
at that point. And were it not 
for stellar play on third downs 
all game, Michigan might well 
have lost.

“You always give yourself a 

good chance to win when you 
have stats like that,” said fifth-
year senior defensive tackle 
Ryan Glasgow.

By the start of the second 

quarter, the Wolverines trailed 
by two touchdowns with the 
Buffaloes 
at 
the 
Michigan 

17-yard line. It was a truly 
compromising position, the first 
the Wolverines had been in all 
season. Guided by quarterback 
Sefo Liufau, Colorado worked 
its way down to the Michigan 

11-yard line, where it faced a 
2nd-and-4.

But from there, something in 

the Wolverines seemed to click. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 
Chase 

Winovich and senior linebacker 
Ben Gedeon combined for a sack 
to set up third-and-10. Then 
Peppers came flying in to stuff a 
receiver for a loss.

The Buffaloes missed the 

ensuing field goal, and though 
Michigan did not convert on 
the 
ensuing 

drive, it held 
Colorado 
scoreless 
for 

the rest of the 
half. 
A 
21-7 

deficit turned 
into a 24-21 
lead. And it 
happened 
because 
Michigan 
stopped 

letting drives continue.

“When 
they 
say, 
‘Punt 

return, get ready,’ I know punt 
return’s probably going to go 
on the field, because the third 
down conversion’s not going to 
happen,” Speight said. “That 
gives us a sense of pride as a 
team to have the defense come 
off the field on third down every 
time. It makes the offense look a 
lot better.”

Impossible 
to 
ignore 
in 

the 
Wolverines 
third-down 

dominance 
was 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown. In 13 
third-down 
tries, 
Michigan 

tallied 
two 
sacks 
and 
a 

quarterback hurry against the 
Buffaloes and allowed just two 
completions out of the nine 
passes Colorado got off.

That 
points 
to 
intense 

quarterback 
pressure, 
and 

Brown 
is 
the 
man 
likely 

responsible. 
Commonly 

referred to as Dr. Blitz, he was 
liberal with his prescription pad 
on Saturday.

“His blitzes are something 

else, let me tell ya,” Glasgow 
said. “He’s got a new one every 
third down, it feels like.”

But there is one caveat 

to 
Michigan’s 
third-down 

success. Trailing 14-7 and fresh 
off a punt-block touchdown, 
the Wolverines forced Colorado 

into a 3rd-and-4. The following 
play was close to a first 
down, but the officials never 
measured because of an offside 
penalty 
on 
redshirt 
junior 

linebacker Mike McCray.

If McCray hadn’t jumped, and 

Michigan had indeed stopped 
the Buffaloes, it would have 
been a three-and-out. Instead, 
the drive went 10 plays for 67 
yards and a touchdown.

The 
Wolverines 
are 

fortunate 
that it didn’t 
matter 
Saturday. 
They got the 
job done on 12 
of the other 13 
third 
downs 

and 
escaped 

with a sound, 

if not comfortable, win.

There are just a few likely 

blowouts left on Michigan’s 
schedule, and that’s why a 
dialogue that Glasgow said 
developed 
on 
the 
sideline 

Saturday is so crucial to the 
Wolverines 
success 
going 

forward.

“You stop ‘em, we’ll score,” 

Glasgow said the offense would 
tell the defense.

“You score,” the defense 

would respond, “We’ll stop 
‘em.”
