'run, hide, fight' if

By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
The nation was on heightened
alert this past week after a major
bombing occurred at the Boston
Marathon. The FBI's two sus-

pects in the incident led police on
a chaotic chase that shut down
the greater Boston area and left a
campus police officer at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy dead after he was ambushed
by the suspects.
The tragedy took place across
the nation, but as shown by an
.incident on Valentine's Day

Though the student simply said
his attire was a "joke," students
were concerned about his behav-

The QAD protocol aims to
decrease the amount of time
that it takes for law enforce-

SCIENCE
ALS research
to study stem
cell treatment

State has higher
proportion of
Gehrig's patients
than nation
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Those living - with amyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis - also
known as Lou Gehrig's Dis-
ease - typically lose their lives
within three to five years of
being diagnosed as they even-
tually lose control of the mus-
cles needed to move, speak and
breathe. Treatment options are
often scare.
However, new research at
the University is aiming to cor-
rect the deficit of treatment
options. Following approval
by an independent ethics
review committee, University
researchers will begin to con-
duct a clinical trial using direct
injection of stem cells into the
spinal cord of ALS patients.
Principal investigator Eva
Feldman, director of the A.
Alfred Taubman Medical
Research Institute, said this
trial could possibly result in
new options for treatment.
,"Stem cells provide a new
treatment avenue in a disease
where there are few other via-
ble options," Feldman said.
Lisa Bardach, a speech
pathologist at ALS of Michigan,

said Michiganhas ahigherinci-
dence of ALS than other states,
adding that the community is
enthusiastic about the potential
research.
"People who have ALS
couldn't care less about those
politics. It's very exciting
research because it's some-
thing that gives us hope, and
anything that gives us hope is
a wonderful thing," Bardach
said.
The disease involves the
degeneration of-motor neuron
- cells that convey impulses
from the brain to muscles. Four
percent of patients live longer
than 10 years and most die of
respiratory failure within three
to five years.
ALS has only one treatment
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, a drug called
Rilutek, which slows the dis-
ease's progression by three to
five months.
The trial's critics are dis-
turbed by the source of the
stem cells - the spinal cord of
an 8-week-old fetus.
Feldman said the cells were
provided by trial sponsor Neu-
ralstem Inc., a Maryland-based
biotech company. The mother
gave consent to the usage of
the fetus' cells a decade ago
and the cells will be used under
the guidelines of the FDA, the
National Institutes of Health
and an outside independent
review board.

Monday, the Athletic Depart-

on the its website, the Athletic
Department will give students
general-admission tickets on a

Ticket prices will be $295 for
seven home games, or more than

Mayor, former
NBA player speak
at downtown event
By LEWAA BAHMAD
For the Daily
In order to celebrate the
beginningofVeg Week, anevent
held to support vegetarianism
and veganism, 150 Ann Arbor
residents gathered Monday at
Downtown Home and Garden.
Ann Arbor's Veg Week event
is part of National Veg Week,
an annual campaign started

by Compassion Over Killing, a
national nonprofit animal advo-
cacy organization. The cam-
paign, hosted in over 11 cities
nationwide, centers itself on a
pledge to abstain from animal
products with the intention of
raising public awareness on the
benefits of vegetarianism and
veganism.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje and vegan advocate John
Salley, a former NBA player,
spoke in support of Veg Week
while local Ann Arbor restau-
rants showcased vegetarian
food ranging from dinners to
desserts.

"Ann Arbor is a place where
people are curious and inter-
ested about all sorts of things,"
Dana Gramprie, the founder
of Ann Arbor Veg Week, said.
"People here are educated and
interested in learning."
Veg Week highlights Ann
Arbor's trend toward green
initiatives, especially those
concerning food production.
In 2003, Ann Arbor started the
Greenbelt Program, an initia-
tive founded to promote local
agriculture, and has since
bought the development rights

EAST LANSING, Mich.
Snyder aims to
connect Mich.
students to jobs
Gov. Rick Snyder said Monday
that Michigan's education and
business must do a better job of
collaborating if the state wants to
improve how it connects graduat-
ing students with available jobs.
The Republican governor gave
the opening remarks at the 18th
annual Governor's Education
Summit at Michigan State Uni-
versity's Kellogg Center. He told
education and business leaders
that while the state's education
system is succeeding in provid-
ing knowledge, students often are
left on their own when it comes to
finding jobs.
"We've built a system that
doesn't work anymore," Sny-
der said, adding that the result
is an imbalance between the
supply and demand for jobs.
NEW YORK CITY
Flight delays pile
up Monday after
FAA budget cuts
It was a tough start to the week
for many air travelers. Flight
delays piled up all along the East
Coast Monday as thousands of air
traffic controllers were forced to
take an unpaid day off because of
federal budget cuts.
Some flights into New York,
Baltimore and Washington were
delayed by more than two hours
as the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration kept planes on the ground
because there weren't enough
controllers to monitor busy air
corridors.
One out of every five flights at
New York's LaGuardia Interna-
tional scheduled to take off before
noon on Monday was delayed 15
minutes or more, according to
flight tracking service FlightA-
ware. Last Monday morning, just
2 percent of LaGuardia's flights
were delayed. The situation was
similar at Washington's Reagan
National Airport, in Newark, N.J.
and in Philadelphia.

Partnership also
aims to improve
delivery of care
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Brachial Plex-
us Program is partnering with
Spring Arbor University faculty
and students to improve the qual-
ity of life for child patients living
with brachial plexus palsy.
Neonatal brachial plexus palsy
is achronic condition that occurs
during pregnancy and childbirth
that results in paralysis and the
loss of sensation in the arm of the
child. The condition can be par-
tially corrected through surgery
and physical therapy, but there's
a need for research to improve
the management of the lifelong
condition.
The research conducted in
the partnership will be unique
because it doesn't intend to find
a cure but instead aims to help
patients suffering from the condi-
tion with their quality of life, said
Lynda Yang, associate professor
of neurological surgery.
Kimberly Rupert, provost of
Spring Arbor University - which
is located in Spring Arbor Town-
ship, about 60 miles southwest
of Ann Arbor - said because the
majority of existing research
focuses on finding a cure, any
new treatment findings will be
significant for patients.
"There is an amazing paucity
of research in this area, so any-
thing we're able to do will directly
contribute to the improvement of
treatment and quality oflife ongo-
ing for the patients," Rupert said.
The inspiration for this
researchgrewoutofYang'sexpe-
riences with affected patients in
the University program.
"When we start seeing these
patients in the clinic, you realize
how much they need in terms

of just addressing activities of
daily life and their functional
impairments," Yang said.
The Brachial Plexus Program
draws upon many disciplines
within University of Michigan
Health System, including ortho-
pedics, general surgery and
physical medicine to allow for a
variety of professionals to sit on
its research team.
Yang said the partnership
will take advantage of the dif-
ferent specialties of both UMHS
and students and faculty at
Spring Arbor University.
"This was a good opportu-
nity to merge the best expertise
of the faculty of two institutions
in order to address some of the
questions that deal with quality
of life," Yang said. "Although we
have much expertise medically
and clinically, they have some
expertise in terms of psychoso-
cial, psychology and other things
that might help the quality of life
of the kids when medical science
likeurgery can't really help."
Rupert echoed Yang's senti-
ment of combining expertise on
the research collaboration.
"We had a meeting in which
the faculty and other folks
involved in the project from both
sides met for the first time, and it
was avery excitingevent," Rupert
said. "There's such a meshing of
the minds and complementary
skills brought to the party."
Although this is a relativelynew
endeavor for the Brachial Plexus
Program, the meetings with SAU
faculty andprovosthave been pro-
ductive enough to establish Med-
SAU, a charitable fund chaired
by retired Sparton Corporation
President David Hockenbrocht.
This would make the partnership
a more long-term project.
"So far,,,everything is head-
ing in the right direction," said
Don Tomford, chief department
administrator of neurosurgery at
UMHS. "It looks like this could
be a long-term collaborative

claims error in
Jackson trial
Eighteen months after his
involuntary manslaughter con-
viction, Michael Jackson's doc-
tor on Monday appealed his case,
claiming there were multiple legal
errors at his trial.
Alawyer for Dr. Conrad Murray
argued in the 230-page appellate
brief that there was insufficient
proof that Jackson died of an over-
dose of the anesthetic propofol
administered by Murray.
The appeal also reiterated
an often-stated defense claim
that Jackson may have admin-
istered the overdose to himself.
CAIRO, Egypt
Egypt's opposing
parties argue over
court structure
Egypt's main opposition group
and judges vowed Monday, to
step up their fight against plans
by the Islamist-dominated legis-
lature to debate a bill critics say
aims to impose Muslim Brother-
hood control over the courts.
The judiciary has become the
latest battleground between sup-
porters and opponents of Islamist
President Mohammed Morsi. The
bill, expected to reduce retire-
ment age for judges, has already
sparked violence between oppo-
nents and supporters.
On Monday, Morsi met with
members of the top judicial body,
the Supreme Judicial Council, in
an attempt to contain the situa-
tion. Morsi said in a statement
he "doesn't accept any encroach-
ing on the judiciary or judges"
and urged judges to stay clear
of media debates and political
interference over the issue to
reaffirm respect of the judiciary
in people's mind.

112th class
comprised of 22
rising seniors
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Order of Angell, an exclusive
campus leadership society, has
released the names of members
of its 112th class.
Order was initially founded
as Michigamua in 1902 by for-
mer University president James
Angell. The group is a network
of select leaders from the Uni-
versity's most high-profile stu-
dent organizations.
Order has faced criticism for
its previous name and alleged
rituals, which some groups

claim are insensitive toward
Native Americans.
Members signed an agree-
ment in 1989 to eliminate ref-
erences to Native American
culture in the group's activities,
choosing to rename the society
after Angell during the 2006-
2007 academic year.
Though the group usually
elects an honorary member, it's
not yet ready to announce this
year's selection, said Kinesiol-
ogy senior Dexter Mason, an
Order spokesman.
In an effort to be transpar-
ent, Order has again released its
most recent membership list to
The Michigan Daily.

Each year, approximately 65,000 students
graduate from American high schools and
find themselves prohibited from pursuing
further educational opportunities because
of their undocumented immigration status.
These students came as minors to this coun-
try as a result of decisions made by their
guardians, and the United States has been
the primary country they have called home.
While many undocumented students gradu-
ate near the top of their high-school classes,
many more are simply good students seeking
an opportunity to enter into the employment
sector and contribute to civic, community
and family life.
As a member of the School of Education
faculty, I am struck by the unique circum-
stances surrounding these students. The law
requires that they be educated through high
school, citing it as a public benefit. Other laws
(and often institutional policies), forbid them
from receiving education beyond high school
in public institutions, arguing their opportu-
nity would somehow threaten public security
or economic and cultural interests.
The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the right
of undocumented students to receive free
public k-12 education in 1982, but it didn't
address access to postsecondary education.
Writing for the majority in the Plyler v. Doe
decision, Justice William Brennan stated,
"Paradoxically, by depriving the children
of any disfavored group of an education, we
foreclose the means by which that group
might raise the level of esteem in which it is
held by the majority. But more directly, 'edu-
cation prepares individuals to be self-reliant
and self-sufficient participants in society.' "
Edutation, Brennan contended, presents the
most promising path to avoid the "specter of
a permanent caste of undocumented resident
aliens, encouraged by some to remain here
as a source of cheap labor, but nevertheless
denied the benefits that our society makes
available to citizens and lawful residents."
The existence of such a shadowed popula-
tion doesn't befit a country committed to the
principles of equality under the law any more
than the denial of educational opportunity
befits our nation's great public universities, of
which ours is certainly one. Public opinions
and politics shift, but we know two facts will
hold true: First, the changing demographics

of our nation and those within our own state
demand the attention of policymakers and
institutional leaders on this issue. Second,
polls and politicians won't admit students or
provide them the financial aid many need to
enroll - institutions will.
A small group of student and administrative
leaders has carefully considered the potential
of the University providing in-state residency
tuition benefits to undocumented students,
and the Board of Regents is currently providing
this group's recomtsendations equally care-
ful consideration. To rank among the leading
public institutions of higher education on this
issue, however, the University must take its
place among peer institutions as one that rec-
ognizes this as an issue of equity and opportu-
nity - and consistent with our core values. We
live, work and learn in a different state policy
environment than our colleagues in California,
Texas, Maryland, Illinois and other states who
have moved to welcome immigrant and undoc-
umented students. Our fundamental values of
academic freedom, educational opportunity
and service to the public good, however, are the
same. The University must not only hold true
to those values, but demonstrate them through
a larger, more public discussion that begins
with recognizing the existence of undocu-
mented students, understanding their unique
life histories apart from the attributed politi-
cal rhetoric and assuring them opportunity to
pursue the educational experiences that will
enable them tomake their full contributions to
our state and nation.
The U.S. Congress is poised to debate a bill
that will provide a path to citizenship for many
of the students who have been described as
"undocumented," a term that will soon pass
into history as being more foreign and indiffer-
ent than the young people it has categorized.
We're a community that's capable of examining
assumptions, interrogatingideas and managing
the implications derived from what we learn.
our students are already leading the move-
ment for tuition equality at the University. Tl*
time has surely come for faculty, staff and othe.
leaders of our university to engage this issue
in a public way that exemplifies our roles and
responsibilities as educators and citizens.

According to the Michigan Eco-
nomic Council, Ann Arbor is the
most pedestrian friendly city in the
state. Even more, Walk Friendly
Communities, a national program
committed to promoting walkable
cities in the United States, has des-
ignated Ann Arbor as a Gold-Level
community - for its commitment
to crossing amenities and traffic-
calming programs, as well as a host
of other initiatives.
And though we may not think
much of it, we're lucky. With such
a walkable city, Ann Arborites
reap significant economic, health
and environmental benefits. More
walking means less money spent on
gas and more foot traffic for local
businesses. More walking means
less driving and, therefore, cleaner
air. More walking means increased
physical activity and all the accom-
panying benefits: healthier hearts,
stronger bones and clearer minds.

group Dialogues, a two-credit
forum that combines active and
personal discussion with academ-
ic reading; Intergroup Conflict
and Co-Existence, a course that
examines the sources of social
coalition and conflict; and an IGR
Capstone, which focuses on Uni-
versity seniors and their social
encounters.
Thompson said intergroup
courses differ from other Univer-
sity lectures and classes aimed at
increasing multicultural aware-
ness.
"Our courses tend to use an
experiential teaching method
where we look at both students'
real life experiences as well as

the literature," Thompson said.
"I think this creates a different
atmosphere in the course."
IGR has worked to increase its
presence on campus through col-
laborations with student organi-
zations, fall orientation programs
and University housing.
But in its 25th year, the pro-
gram will reach out to its alumni
base. In early fall, an event will
invite IGR alumni to campus,
showing students that "once they
graduate, there will be a group
of people still committed to the
issues of intergroup relations
that they can also connect with,"
Thompson said.
IGR will also hold a symposium
in the fall to discuss their findings
on how their pedagogy can con-
tribute to the academic literature
on the subject.,

Thompson said IGR hasa lot of
potential to grow across schools
and colleges in the University
and in K-12 education in the Ann
Arbor community.
IGR has also demonstrated its
power to affect individual stu-
dents.
LSA freshman Shang Chen,
a participant in an intergroup
dialogue, said he registered for
the course as a requirement for
his learning community, the
Michigan Community Scholars
Program. As an international
student, he said the program pro-
vided an open platform for com-
munication.
"Unlike other classes (with
only) lectures and discussions,
the Intergroup Dialogues course
provides participants with more
freedom to speak and more

opportunity to be really engaged
in dialogue," he said.
Interacting with multicultural
students and reflecting on experi-
ences are a key part of the course,
and Chen said students with a
passion for "multicultural experi-
ences and international conversa-
tions" would find the class most
fruitful.
Dessel said IGR has received
positive student feedback due to
its intimacy in communication
and the available guidance of peer
facilitators. She said the courses
tend to be small, which contrib-
utes to the safety that students are
looking for.
"Students find that these
courses provide a safe space for
them to talk about difficult topics,
such as social identity conflict,"
Dessel said.

"We are concerned about
the decrease in students show-
ing up and decided to change
our policy to createsa culture
of arriving early to provide our
football student-athletes with
a home field advantage prior
to kickoff," Ablauf said. "This
move is similar to what has
already been done at Crisler
Center and Yost Ice Arena for
student season ticket holders.
Both are decisions that have
been met favorably."
Ablauf noted that the charge
is similar to fellow Big Ten teams
including Michigan State Uni-
versity and Pennsylvania State*
University, as well as national
programs like Alabama, Notre
Dame and Oregon.
In 2012, the athletic depart-
ment created the H.A.I.L.
mobile application to incentiv-
ize attendance at athletic events,
including getting to the Big
House on time.
Many students have
expressed mostly negative
opinions regarding the change
on social media. A petition
through CSG's UPetition site
has over 2,300 signers as of late
Monday night.
A group of students has
already voiced their displea-
sure about the announcement
via Facebook. A group had more

than 1,500 likes in less than
three hours since its creation.
"The goal of the page was
to raise awareness and gather
enough followers to voice our
displeasure though petitions, in
hopes of overturning the new
policy," said LSA junior Josh
Spiegel. "We feel the policy
destroys the tradition of work-
ing your way closer to the field
through years of studying and
work."
Central Student Government
president Michael Proppe, an
LSA and business junior, has
already taken action to discuss
the newly implemented changes.
"Why didn't the Athletic
Department ask for any stu-
dent input before implement-
ing this?" Proppe said. "In my
first resolution as student body
president, co-authored by Bobby
Dishell and Annie Pidgeon, Iam
calling for U-M Central Student
Government input on anyticket-
ing policy changes made by the
Athletic Department."
In a non-scientific Facebook
poll conducted by the Daily, 497
people chose the "Hate it" option
when asked their stance on the
new policy. as of 12:30 a.m. Tues-
day. Eighty-five people said they
love it, 36 said they dislike it but
understand the move and 25 vot-
ers remained indifferent.

gan on Aug. 31 before they host

UMPD

country to adopt Quick Action
Deployment following the Col-
umbine shooting, according 'to
officials.
University Police Chief Joseph
Piersante, the interim director
of the Division of Public Safety
and Security, said though UMPD
officers are prepared to deal with
high-risk situations like an active
shooter, it is also important that
students, faculty and staff know
what to do if they encounter an
active shooter. " ,
The University has recently
begun an emergency train-
ing program that educates stu-
dents, faculty and staff to use the
"run, hide, fight" concept when
responding to emergency situa-
tions.
Following the concept, civil-
ians should first attempt to flee an
area under attack, if possible. If
an exit route is not readily avail-
able, civilians are advised to hide
or barricade themselves. As a last
resort - if they are not able to run
or hide - civilians should make
an effort to fight and disarm the
intruder.
Piersante stressed the impor-

tance of taking action to protect
oneself in an active shooter situ-
ation. In active shooter situations
on campuses in the past, Pier-
sante said casualties were mini-
mized when victims took action
rather than remaining passive.
"It's a hard decision, because
most people aren't taught to fight
violently," Piersante said. "But
once (a shooter) gets into the
classroom, they just systemati-
cally shoot people."
University Police spokeswom-
an Diane Brown pointed out that
if community members need to
defend themselves, classrooms
offer materials that aren't nor-
mally seen as weapons, such as
books, backpacks and comput-
ers. Throwing these materials at
an attacker could potentially dis-
tract and disarm them, and pos-
sibly save lives.
Piersante added that it's
important that the public under-
stand that, in the event of an
active shooter situation, officers
are instructed to bypass injured
victims so they can reach a
shooter fast to prevent further
casualties.
While the Valentine's Day sit-
uation didn't escalate beyond the
informal evacuation of Mason
Hall, an emergency alert would

have been sent out to the cam-
pus in the event that police con-
firmed an armed suspect.
In 2008, University Police
created the Emergency Alert
System to notify students, fac-
ulty and staff of emergencies or
severe weather via text message,
voice message and e-mail. Brown
said the system is only activated
when a significant portion of
campus needs to take immediate
action to keep themselves safe.
Emergency alerts are intend-
ed to inform the community
that officers are responding to
an incident, and may include
instructions to avoid parts of
campus that police deem unsafe.
Emergency alerts are differ-
ent from crime alerts, which
are used to let people know that
there a crime has yet to be solved'
and may pose a threat to the
community's safety.
When a crime alert is released,
"people don't necessarily need to
take shelter or avoid a building,"
Brown said.
"They need to be aware of it,"
Brown said. "We have had a cou-
ple of cases that have been solved
because after we issued a crime
alert, we received information
from students that led to the
arrest of a suspect."

While University Police offi-
cers are on the frontline of'
emergency response, physicians
and nurses at the University of
Michigan Health System also
play a key part in responding to
disasters.
The emergency department at
University Hospital is classified
as Level One Pediatric and Adult
Trauma Center, meaning it is
able to provide the highest level
of surgical care possible to trau-
ma patients. The hospital often
receives transfer cases from
hospitals throughout the region
who may be dealing with trau-
ma patients. It is also equipped
with two decontamination tents
that can be used in the event of a
HAZMAT situation.
Marilyn Hollier, the director
of Security and Entrance Ser-
vices for University Hospital and
Health Centers, said emergency
physicians, nurses and staff fre-
quently run drills to prepare for
trauma events as well as emer-
gencies that may occur within
the hospital.
"We're prepared for when
disasters happen in the commu-
nity and patients come to us,"
Hollier said. "We have an inter-
nal training program for when
disasters happen here."

Feldman said the research, and
its use of stem cells, has received
an "overwhelmingly positive"
community response.
Ed Rivet, legislative direc-
tor of Right to Life, a group that
advocates against abortion, said
the organization has received an
unusual amount of press atten-
tion concerning its response to
the University research.
"It's utilitarianism to the worst
degree," Rivet said. "It's one thing

to say, 'You know, I can donate
blood that can help another
person.'. But this is destroying
a developing human fetus and
using that as medical treatment.
It's just unethical."
Rivet said this was the first
time a Michigan university is
involved with a large-scale stem
cell research project. However,
Right to Life, whose activities
mainly focus on advocacy and
education, is not currently orga-
nizing any legislative action to
counter the trials.
LSA junior Victoria Criswell,
president of Students for Life, said

her group will also not be taking
action, aside from the possibility
of hosting a debate on stem-cell
research.
She added that Students for Life
supports stem cells taken from
umbilical cords or bone marrow.
This trial will deal with devel-
oping new treatments. The first
phase of the trial concerned
safety and took place at Emory
University School of Medicine.
Out of 18 patients, oneregained
use of his legs. Feldman said, to
her knowledge, such results have
not been reported with other
therapies.

The FDA approved expansion
into the next phase on April 15.
"In a Phase Two trial, you get
to expand your approach," Feld-
man said. "You're not only look-
ing at safety but the efficacy' of
the product you are giving to the
patient."
A custom-built apparatus
injects stem cells directly into
the patient's spinal cord, which is
exposed after the removal of some
of the patient's vertebrae. The
Phase One trial involved 500,000
to one million stem cells injected
in the patient, while Phase Two
will involve two to 16 million.

U.S. State Department described

ment also announced financial
penalties against one of the men.
Alireza Miryousefi, spokes-
man for the Iranian mission to
the United Nations, said the ter-
rorist network was not operating
in Iran.
"Iran's position against this
group is very clear and well
known. (Al-Qaida) has no pos-
sibility to do any activity inside
Iran or conduct any operation
abroad from Iran's territory,"
Miryousefi said in a statement
emailed to the AP late Monday.
"We reject strongly and cat-
egorically any connection to this
story."
The investigation surrounding
the planned attack was part of a
cross-border operation involving
Canadian law enforcement agen-
cies, the FBI and the U.S. Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.
The attack "was definitely
in the planning stage but not
imminent," RCMP chief super-
intendent Jennifer Strachan
said Monday. "We are alleging
that these two individuals took
steps and conducted activities to
initiate a terrorist attack. They

watched trains and railways."
Strachan said they were tar-
geting a route, but did not say
whether it was a cross border
route. Best said the duo had been
under investigation since last fall.
Their bail hearing was scheduled
in Toronto on Tuesday.
Via Rail said that "at no time"

the public in imminent danger.

In Washington, Amtrak
president Joe Boardman said
the Amtrak Police Department
would continue to work with
Canadian authorities to assist in
the investigation. Via Rail and
Amtrak jointly operate trains
between Canada and the U.S.
U.S. Rep. Peter King, a New
York Republican, said in a state-
ment praising Canadian authori-
ties for the arrests, that the attack
was intended "to cause signifi-

Charges against the two men
include conspiring to carryout an

Army sergeant
admits to killing
five at clinic
JOINT BASE LEWIS-
MCCHORD, Wash. (AP) - An
Army sergeant pleaded guilty
Monday to killing four other sol-
diers and aNavy officer in 2009 at
mental health clinic in Baghdad
during the Iraq War, describing
how he gunned down the men
and saying he was in a "rage"
when he began his rampage.
The plea agreement in a mili-
tary court at Joint Base Lew-
is-McChord means Sgt. John
Russell will avoid the death sen-
tence. His maximum sentence
would be a life term. He testified

Monday to persuade Army judge
Col. David Conn to accept the
agreement. Conn agreed.
Russell - who is from Sher-
man, Texas - went on a shooting
spree at the Camp Liberty Com-
bat Stress Center near Baghdad in
May 2009. Itwas one of the worst
instances of soldier-on-soldier
violence in the Iraq war.
In court, Russell said he was in
a "rage" when he opened fire.
"I wanted the pain to stop,"
he testified in court at JointsBase
Lewis-McChord,, talking in a
husky voice. He read a written
statement detailing his memories
of the killings.
Russell was nearing the end of
his third tour when his behavior
changed, members of his unit
testified in 2009. They said he

became more distant in the days
before the May 11, 2009, attack
and that he seemed paranoid
that his unit was tryingto end his
career.
On May 8, Russell sought
help at a combat stress clinic at
Camp Stryker, where his unit
was located. On May 10, Russell
was referred to the Camp Liberty
clinic, where he received counsel-
ing and prescription medication.
The following day witnesses
saw Russell crying and talking
about hurting himself. He went
back to the Camp Liberty clin-
ic, where a doctor told him he
needed to get help or he would
hurt himself Russell tried to sur-
render to military police to lock
him up so he wouldn't hurt him-
self or others, witnesses said.

Investigation into
devastating blast
is ongoilng
WEST, Texas (AP) - When
the first call came in, it was
just a fire. Smoke was coming
from West Fertilizer Co. and
an alarm was sounding, so a
woman at a park just across
the railroad tracks called 911.
She was calm and matter of
fact. The dispatcher respondeed
in kind: "OK, I'm going to get
them to put out the fire."
It was 7:29 p.m. April 17,
and the last routine moment in
West, Texas, since.
Within 20 minutes, the park
was stre wn with two-foot
chunks i) Fconcrete from the
exploded fertilizer plarnt. The
apartment coniplex behind it
was ripped apart by the wave
of energy that climbed the rail-
road bed and slannned into the
building, shredding its roof and
blowing out windows.
Dispatchers swere swamped
withhysterical reports. Nearly all
50 calls that flooded in durinthe

next 35 minutes came from with-
in a mile of the plant. Some knew
what happened, others knew only
that windows had suddenly shat-
tered on them and houses several
blocks from the site were on fire.
Firefighters and EMTs
would account for 10 of 14 peo-
ple killed, and more than 200
people in the town of 2,800
would be counted as injured.
State and federal investiga-
tors continued combing the site
Monday looking for the cause of
the blast so powerful it registered
as small earthquake. They had
found the center of the explosion
a day earlier, but not the fire's
starting point.
Recordings show fears ran
rampant among those who called
911 last Wednesday night.
One woman who glanced out-
side andsaw the mushroomcloud
that erupted from the blast could
be heard shouting: "Getoout of the
house. Get out," to those around
her. "There's a freaking cloud.
Look at that!" An off-duty fire-
fighter concerned about the air
called a second time to saylhe was
leaving with his family. A man
wearina mn ankle monitor told

a dispatcher as he drove that he
was fleeing the chemicals.
Investigators later assured
residents the town's air was not
toxic.
Calls from those further
away relate terror of the
unknown. Dispatcheys asked
callers to take deep breaths and
repeat the unintelligible.
"Something happened out
here," a crying 83-year-old
woman tells the operator, her
voice quavering. "Our house
exploded or something. There
was abigexplosion and then our
house is just destroyed.
"We're all ok, but my God,
what has happened?" she said.
"tom scared to death."
Residents and dispatchers
soon realized the enormity of
the situation. One woman who
called about a house burning on
her street was asked if she lived
close to the fertilizer plant. But
she said she was several blocks
away.
Less than five minutes after
the first explosion call,dispatch-
ers also knew West's own emer-
gency resources were severely
hamnered.

Nicaragua nabs U.S. most-
wanted child porn suspect

Former school
teacher apprehended
after months of
surveillance
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -
Police in Nicaraguahave detained
a former U.S. school teacher who
was on the FBI's 10 most-wanted
fugitives as a suspect in a child
pornography investigation,
authorities confirmed Monday.
Eric Justin Toth was detained
Saturday in Esteli, a city near
Nicaragua's border with Hon-
duras, and will be immediately
deported to the United States,
said National Police chief Amin-
ta Granera.

"Toth will be deported imme-
diately because he was in our
country illegally," Granera said at
a news conference in Managua,
the capital.
She said Toth entered Nicara-
gua with a false passport and also
had a fake driver's license and
credit cards.
Toth was being handed over
to FBI agents present at the news
conference and they planned to
take him to the U.S. in a special
plane, Granera said.
A thin and nervous-looking
Toth dressed in cream-colored
shirt and pants was briefly pre-
sented to journalists and photog-
raphers who took his picture, but
he wasn't allowed to talk and was
quicklytaken away.
Granera said Toth first entered

Nicaragua on Oct. 24, 2012, and
left on Jan. 27. He returned on
Feb. 12 and that's when Nicara-
guan police began keeping a close
watch, she said.
"He was captured in a house in
the Panama Soberana neighbor-
hood in Esteli, even though he
resisted," Granera said.
Toth taught third grade at
Beauvoir, a private elementary
school on the grounds of the
Washington National Cathedral.
He was escorted off campus in
June 2008 after another teacher
reported finding sexually explicit
photographs on a school camera
in Toth's possession. He had not
been seen since he lost his job.
In a statement, the school
commended the work of U.S.
anhorities

centage and a

percentage. They are also leading
the Big Ten in nearly every other
offensive category, including runs,
hits, RBI, triples, home runs, total
bases ond walks. The pitching has
backed the offense up, averaging
almost one strikeout per inning.
Tuesday, No. 9 Michigan (16-0
Big Ten, 39-7 overall) will take a
break from dominating confer-
ence play to face Central Michigan
(11-3 Mid-American Conference,
25-13) at Alumni Field. The Chip-
pewas are coming off a heart-
breaking 3-2 extra-inning loss
to Toledo on Sunday, a loss that
snapped a seven-game winning
streak in which Central Michigan
outscored conference opponents,
39-15, to climb into second place in
the MAC.

"Every game from this point
on, whether conference or non-
conference, is critical, as we're
putting together a resume not
only to win a conference cham-
pionship, but to earn an at-large
berth into the NCAA Tourna-
ment," Bakich said.
Michigan (8-4 Big Ten, 22-16-
overall) will travel to Ypsilanti,
Mich. to take on Eastern Michi-
gan (8-7 Mid-American Confer-
ence, 18-18) on Tuesday in its
next opportunity to maintain an
already impressive slate.
Monday, Bakich said soph-
omore right-hander James
Bourque will get the start for
the Wolverines. Bourque has
already established his role as
a midweek starter, boasting a
3.51 earned-run average in 41
innings. Opposing batters are
hitting just .263 against him.
In a disappointing weekend at

a rebound
Northwestern, the Wolverines
faltered when they had chances
to extend the lead. Many hard-
hit balls were pulled back into
the park due to brutal weather
conditions, but as Bakich said,
loud outs aren't going to con-
tribute to winning games.
"We need to adjust to the ele-
ments, and when the wind is
howling in like it was all three
games this weekend, we need
to do a better job of hitting line
drives and hard groundballs,"
Bakich said.
Michigan left six runners on
base in an extra-innings heart-
breaker in game two of Sunday's
doubleheader, and the inability
to record hits with runners in
scoring position continues to be
the Wolverines' achilles heel.
Still, the pitching has been
stellar in the last few weeks
and has been the base of Michi-
gan's ability to win,10 of its past
12 games. Bourque will look
to keep the Wolverines' recent
success alive, and with another
pitching performance like last
week's - he didn't allow a hit
against then-No. 29 Notre Dame
in 7.2 innings - Michigan's
chances are looking bright.
Continuously adding tallies
to the Wolverines' win column
will only help the construction
of their NCAA Tournament
resume that already boasts five
combined wins against Michi-
gan State and Notre Dame,
which sit at Nos. 26 and 27,
respectively, in the RPI. With
obvious work 'left to do, Tues-
day's game, and every game
after, is crucial heading into the
Big Ten Tournament.

Freshman outfielder Sierra Lawrence won her first Big Ten Freshman of the Week award after a grand slam Sunday.

The Chippewas are efficient
offensively and don't leave many
runners on base. Coupled with
a strategy that includes aggres-
sive base stealing makes them a
hard team to play against. A key
to Toledo's win Sunday was catch-
ing Central Michigan in unlucky
double plays and picking off its
runners, so for Michigan to have
success, its infield will have to dis-
play the same discipline against
crafty baserunners.
Offensively, the Wolverines can
steal bases, too, especially senior
second baseman Ashley Lane,
who is 7-for-8 in steal attempts. In
addition to base running, Michi-
gan will count on freshmen Sierra
Romero and Sierra Lawrence to
drive in runs. Lawrence claimed
her first Big Ten Freshman on the

Week award after batting .462
while having a hit and a RBI in
each of Michigan's four confer-
ence games. On Sunday, she hit
her first-career grand slam against
Iowa and tied her career-best
with four RBI. Fellow classmate
Romero has already received six
weekly rookie awards this season,
prompting teams to pitch around
her. She has gotten on base each of
the last 25 games, and has already
hit 19 home runs.
Behind the offensive firepower
is a strong pitching rotation con-
sisting of sophomores Sara Dries-
enga and Haylie Wagner. Over the
weekend, Driesenga struck out
six batters on her way to her fifth
shutout of the season. Meanwhile,
Wagner won her 15th game behind
five strikeouts and zero walks.

When these teams met last
year, the Wolverines earned a
run-rule victory after six innings.
The Chippewas were the first to
score, but Michigan put up nine
runs in the sixth inning and even-
tually won the game, 10-2. Explo-
sive innings like that have become
common for the Wolverines,
who've picked up 15 mercy-rule
decisions this year. If their bats get
hot, they could add another and
extend their winning streak to 22.
Their current 21-game win
streak is the longest in the nation
and their 16-straight conference
wins make up the best streak since
2009, when they won 17 in a row.
To make things even harder for
Central Michigan, the game is in
Ann Arbor, where Michigan is
undefeated on the year.

"The life of Martin Luther

'Reincarnated'
misrepresents
Rastafarianism
By SHAMIK GANGULY
Daily Arts Writer
Snoop Dogg has been Rein-
carnated as Snoop Lion with
his latest release, a product of
his explora-
tions of peace,
reggae and
Rastafarian- Reincarnated
ism. The proj-
ect combines Snoop Lion
the efforts of RSA
many major
producers,
including Diplo and Major Lazer
- particular efforts to cover up
Snoop's ignorance with popular
production techniques.
Violence in the hip-hop world
led Snoop to Jamaica to reinvent
himself, where he found that
with reggae and Rastafarianism,
he can promote peace, instead
of strife, through his music. In
other words, he can have all the
money and weed without the gun
charges. Exposing himself to the
influence of original reggae art-
ists like Jimmy Cliff, Gregory
Isaacs and the Wailers - and
opening his "third eye" - have
allowed him to put forth Reincar-
nated. ,
Snoop parades his new ide-
als on "No Guns Allowed." The
song sends a powerful message by
denouncing gun violence around
the world and features Snoop's

daughter, Cori B. It's not- clear
whether the song apologizes for
Snoop's previous gun incidents
or attempts to sweep them under
the rug,butit carries a commend-
able message in today's social cli-
mate. On the other hand, in "Here
Comes the King," the chorus sings
"We at war with the army of hat-
ers / And when we kill them we
just smoke them like papers,"
which is a brief but glaring devia-
tion from Snoop's peaceful vibe.
In fact, other themes in the
album reveal Snoop's lack of
commitment to Rastafarian-
ism. A familiar reggae message
gets twisted in "Here Comes.
the King." The song promotes
unity under the King (the ruler
of the world appointed by Jah),
but in this context, the King is
Snoop Lion, and he lets everyone
know that they're beneath him
("You might be a lord / but here
comes the king") and makes
some unintentionally tyrannical
statements ("Power to the peo-
ple, let 'em kiss the ring / Bow,
here comes the king").
It seems that Snoop thinks he's
an incarnation of Haile Selassie,
which isn't too surprising of a
claim, since he also thinks he's
Bob Marley. Maybe these incon-
sistencies explain why the lead-
ers of the Rastafari movement,
including reggae legend Bunny
Wailer, are pissed off and expect a
public apology. In fact, the Rasta-
fari Millenium Council has sent a
formal written demand threaten-
ing to sue Snoop ifhe doesn't make
reparations for his misrepresenta-
tion of Rastafarian culture. Bunny

Wailer calls his use of the culture
fraudulent, and the council calls
him out for filtering their ideals
downto weed and reggae.
Despite the fact that Snoop
thinks that replacing "I" with
"me" in his lyrics and wearing a
colored hat were his last steps in
becoming a purveyor of Jamaican
tradition, not everything on the
album is ignorant. Who steps into
save the day? It's not Drake, who
clearly wrote down the wrong
tempo during the studio meeting
and can't seem to keep up with the
beat. The burden comes down on
Diplo, Major Lazer and the other
producers who create the meat
of the album. Well-executed one
drops, an effective use of horns
and groovybass lines showcase at
least an elementary understand-
ing of reggae foundations.
The producers don't attempt
to recreate reggae, but rather use
its assets to make pop/hip hop.
They take ska horn lines and put
them deep in the bass register
where they function as a hip-hop
groove. Unfortunately, some of
their experimentations go awry
- in "Torn Apart," a sound effect
that attempts to emulate some
form of hand percussion sounds
more like a wet fart and totally
distracts from the purpose of
the song - but they make Miley
Cyrus shine in "Ashtrays and
Heartbreaks" and create a solid
foundation for the record.
Researching or thinking too
hard about Reincarnated will only
disappoint, so reserve this album
for your "Summer Jams" playlist
and give it no further attention.

Phoenix strikes gold

French band never
loses a step on
danceable album
By ERIKA HARWOOD
Daily Arts Writer
Two weekends ago, rumors
swirled around the desert ofIndio,
Calif. that Daft Punk would join its
fellow French-
men of Phoenix A-
onstage during
their set at the Bankrupt!
Coachella Music he
Festival (feel
free to take a Glassnote
moment now
to imagine that
on-stage collaboration). However,
the two helmeted men in shiny
designer suits never showed up.
Instead, at the end of Phoenix's set,
a lustrous, unaccompanied voice
emerged from the unlit stage. A
voice that belonged to none other
than the modern-day poet and
man who spends a notable amount
of time in closets, R. Kelly.
As the lights turned on, R. Kelly
continued to slowly belt out the
lyrics to "Bump n' Grind" while
Phoenix waited patiently behind
him. Where was this going? Why
was R. Kelly onstage with Phoe-
nix? Was this some weird Coach-
ella installation art piece? At this
point, nothing in life made sense
and the confusion among the pre-
sumably intoxicated crowd was
probably widespread. Then, after
R. Kelly commanded the crowd to
"make some noise," Phoenix began
playing their 2009 fame-maker,
"1901," as R. Kelly gyrated across
the stage singing, "Now I'm not
trying to be rude / But hey pretty
girl, I'm feeling you..."
Yes. A mashup of R. Kelly's
"Ignition (Remix)" and Phoenix's
"1901" happened live onstage and
transformed Phoenix's set into one
oftheweirdestCoachellamoments
since that Tupac hologram. We
should all feel soblessed to live on

GLA SSNOTE

Next year, Coachella will take place on Mars.

,A

a planet where Phoenix's Thomas
Mars andR. Kelly can share a stage
singing "Sippin' on coke and rum
/ I'm like, 'so what, I'm drunk' "
together as one.
Thanks to this impossible-to-
predict performance, the hype for
Phoenix's fifth album, Bankrupt!,
reached its peak. Despite being
together since 2000, Phoenix
soared to immense popularity in
2009 with the release of its last
album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoe-
nix, which churned out hits such as
"Lisztomania" and "1901," result-
ing in the group's first Grammy
win.
"Entertainment," the first
single off of Bankrupt!, glistens
with light synths before drums
erupt and more synthetic layers
emerge, transforming the song
into the album's danceable open-
ing track. While the group's fifth
full-length album doesn't depart
much from its previous efforts,
Bankrupt! serves as a compila-
tion of Phoenix's best elements:
fresh-sounding synth rock.
Tracks like "Trying to Be
Cool" and "The Real Thing"
shine like classic Phoenix songs,
with dazzling synths and light,
grooveable melodies that will
surely make the cut for many
summer-themed playlists. "Try-
ing to Be Cool" stands out as
a potential next single on the

album, with its breezy electron-
ic-alt sound that seems crafted
for outdoor summer listening.
Also, does Phoenix think it has
to "try" to be cool? Only those
who are effortlessly cool can get
R. Kelly to make an appearance
while they headline one of the
world's most famous music fes-
tivals.
The group even takes a page
out of the Wolfgang book with
the. almost seven-minute-long
instrumental track "Bank-
rupt!," unarguably reminiscent
of Wolfgang's "Love Like a Sun-
set." While none of the tracks
set themselves apart as any
sort of risk or experimentation
for the group, Bankrupt!'s 10
tracks could all be identified as
Phoenix, something the group
has been cultivating for over a
decade. Mars' breathy vocals
can easily be traced on songs
such as "Don't" and the slightly
slower "Bourgeois," adding to
the laundry list of reasons why
Bankrupt! will prove to be a fan-
pleaser.
This doesn't mean the album
is without its flaws. Despite
what the Coachella performance
might have people believe (or
dream), R. Kelly doesn't make an
appearance on the album, and
the absence is notable. Maybeon
the Bankrupt! re-release?

Will.i.am putters
out with derivative
sound
By GREGORY HICKS
DailyArts Writer
First and foremost, congratu-
lations to will.i.am for actually
getting the momentum to release
another solo
I album. After C-
"T.H.E. (The
Hardest Ever)" #willpower
- the track .i
intended to be w..am
#willpower's Interstope
lead single -
undersold,
will.i.am fell off of the radar, per-
haps at the risk of having a repeat-
ed incident from his Songs About
Girls days.
The all-American rapper has
Britney Spears to thank, without
whom, "Scream & Shout" would
just be another failed solo project.
The number of times Spears has
offered to collaborate on another
artist's work can be tallied on one
hand, so will.iam is nothing short
of extremely fortunate. Spears
is one of the few artists that can
chart any song simply by tacking
her name on it, with very little
promotional effort required.
Most of the anticipation rallied
for #willpower is wasted, how-
ever. While "Scream & Shout" is
proportionately fun, bizarre and
contemporary, each track on this
fourth studio album falls short of
the entertaining lead single.
The record's other promotional
singles - the most radio-friendly
songs on #willpower, by far - are
mimics of existing material. The
follow-up to "Scream & Shout,"
"#thatPower," is a sibling of Daft
Punk's notorious hit, "Harder,

p.

Will.i'm.not.
Better, Faster, Stronger," and the
third promotional single, "Fall
Down" is a lovechild of Ke$ha's
"Did Young" and "Crazy Kids."
Needless to say, Dr. Luke's pro-
duction and writing continues
to dwindle as he copy and pastes
his work with Ke$ha onto this
wil.i.am track. Look closely at
#willpower's album cover, and
you'll see will.i.am regretfully
reflecting on his choice of Justin
Bieber and Miley Cyrus as the fea-
tures on these two tracks.
Equally aggravating are
will.i.am's constant attempts to
make insignificantartists relevant
- ironic, given that he can't even
seem to solve that problem him-
self. For once, the rapper buckled
down and hosted a few big names
on his album (i.e. Britney, Chris
Brown), but that doesn't stop the
flow of irrelevancy from artists
like Eva Simons, Skylar Grey and
Juicy J. It's a wonder Cheryl Cole
didn't make it onto the album.
Given the emphasis on produc-
tion and features, will.i.am should
give some thought to the title "DJ
will.i.am."
In another attempt to redefine
electronic music, overproduc-
tion swallows #willpower's other
tracks. The vocals of "Far Away
From Home" sound likethey were

recorded underwater - unfortu-
nate, given the power of Nicole
Scherzinger's voice - and filler
tracks like "Hello," "Great Times
Are Coming" and "Bang Bang"
are a combination of excessive
snares, kicks, wind swooshes and
anticlimactic bass drops.
Some controversy stirred over
the track "Let's Go" for the theft
of Arty and Matt Zo's dance track,
"Rebound," but in will.i.am's
defense, it seems that people ran-
domly had a bone to pick with
him. Beyonce is accredited as
being music's biggest song thief,
yet nobody throws away their
Queen B shrine that they use to
worship all of her accomplish-
ments.
The record summarizes
music's predominant flaw in this
early part of the new decade:
innovation attempts. Wheth-
er it's will.i.am, Justin jDieber,
Ke$ha or even Selena Gomez,
every artist is trying to reinvent
music at the expense of writing
a decent album, and the music's
weak foundation collapses under
messy production. Remember
the story of "The Emperor's New
Clothes"? Sometimes. no matter
how trendy something appears,
it's just impossible to get past the
fact that there's nothing there.

By RAY MALO
Daily Arts Writer
Each year, when Spring begins
to creep in, a couple friends and
I like to speculate as io what new
song has a shot of becoming the
Song of the Summer. Sometimes
it's a dark horse candidate, some
unlikely number we boldly believe
deserves it; other times it's a no-
brainer. Around this time last year,
I thought I was presenting the
underdog when I claimed that a
bratty little four-to-the-floor track
called "I Love It," from an unknown
Swedish duo called Icona Pop, was
the one. But it soon started show-
ing up everywhere, its guitar intro
revving like a vintage motorbike
shooting through a brick wall. The
women of Icona Pop, neither sing-
ers nor musicians, chant-screamed
an approximate melody in unison,
describing the euphoria that can
only come from freeing yourself
from the clutches of a boring lover.
It made me and everyone I know
feel like a'90s bitch. It was the Song
of the Summer.
That brilliant song was writ-
ten and gifted to Icona Pop by
20-year-old English Goth-Glam
queen Charli XCX, whose own
debut LP, True Romance, was
released on April 16th. There may
not be a shout-along gem like "I
Love It" on the record, but that
doesn't seem to be what she's going
for here. What's most apparent is
that the woman knows her way
