LANSING - In a meeting
at the Capitol Building in Lan-
sing, students got the chance
to influence lawmakers when
they presented policy propos-
als to a panel of state officials in
the House Commission on Civic

Engagement yesterday.
The students are part of the
Michigan Student Caucus, a
group created by the House
Commission on Civic Engage-
ment in 2001 to give students the
opportunity to discuss issues
and draft legislation to help
solve the state's problems. Par-
ticipants receive feedback from
legislators about the strengths
and weaknesses of their propos-
als and about how to turn their
suggested legislation into real-
ity.
The caucus members are
mostly students in an educa-
tion course offered at the Uni-

versity's Ann Arbor and Flint
campuses, but all college and
high school students in the state
are welcome to participate. Par-
ticipants present ideas in several
categories: economic develop-
ment and community revitaliza-
tion, arts and culture, human
development and welfare, envi-
ronment and health, justice and
equity and community service.
Gary Weisserman, MSC co-
facilitator and head of the five-
year college preparatory school
Oakland Early College, said the
caucus is a way for students to
address issues that they think
are important in the state.

"In the broadest sense, it is a
program that is designed to give
students at Michigan a voice in
what happens in Michigan,"
Weisserman said.
Jay McDowell, president of
the Howell Education Associa-
tion and co-facilitator of MSC,
said the program provides "a
sense of empowerment" for stu-
dents who often feel restricted
in their university environments
when discussing topics like gov-
ernment policy.

at a problem, you can analyze it,

Experts: WikiLeaks highlights
security, journalistic concerns

Editors scrutinize
cables before they're
released, University
professors say
By HALEY GLATTHORN
DailyStaffReporter
Since WikiLeaks released more
than 250,000 classified U.S. gov-
ernment cables on Nov. 28, con-
troversy over the documents and
the decision to release them has
continued to grow.

The exposure of private cables
detailing the thoughts and activi-
ties of U.S. officials stationed
internationally has created what
some consider to be a serious
security threat and others simply
an embarrassing roadblock in for-
eign affairs. Since the cables were
released, pundits and experts
have also raised questions about
the extent to which journalis-
tic freedom is protected amid
national security concerns.
Communication Studies Prof.
Anthony Collings - who worked
as a reporter or editor for The
Wall Street Journal, The Associ-

ated Press, Newsweek and CNN -
said he has mixed feelings about
the release of the documents.
"On one hand, it's good that the
public learns more information
about our relations with other
countries ... (for) countries where
there are problems in our rela-
tionships, we get a more truth-
ful picture of where things are
going badly," Collings said. "On
the other hand, I'm not quite sure
what (WikiLeaks founder Julian
Assange's) intention is. I'm a little
concerned that his intentions may
be harmful."

Schools would
shorten summer

By SARA BOBOLTZ
Daily StaffReporter
A partnership between the Uni-
versity's School of Education and

Ann Arbor Public Schools may
soon give students at Mitchell Ele-
mentary School and Scarlett Mid-
dle School the option to spend less
time on summer vacation and more
time in the classroom.
Formerly known as the lab
school program, the partnership
aims to create an experimental K-8
campus between the two schools.
The schools would adopt a "bal-
anced" school year model that
would shorten summer break from

ten weeks to six, but extend other
breaks into "intersessions."
Though leaders and experts say
the program would help prevent
students from losing the knowl-
edge they've gained during the
school year in the summer, some
AAPS parents criticized the plan
at a meeting last night, saying it
would cut into already limited
family time. Parents' hesitation

From knowing how to slip on the ice
safely to protecting oneself from amug-
ger,understandingthe artofself-defense
can come in handy on a daily basis and
Godai Ninpo - a martial arts club on
campus - aims to arm its members with
the abilityto protect themselves.
With a membership of about 60 Uni-
versity students, Godai Ninpo stresses
learning martial arts for practical day-
to-day use rather than offense. The
group meets for two hours each Sunday,
and some members also practice during
the week either on campus or at their
off-campus training facility - the Ann
Arbor College of Martial Arts, which is
run by University alumni Ross Winkler
and Rob B'yas.
"We don't do thingsalike matches and
tournaments," intergroup liaison and
LSA senior Andrew Gomes said. "We're
much more focused on how you defend
yourself against a mugger or against
someone who's legitimately trying to

1odai Ninpi
At practices, members of the group
learn various skills including how to
roll properly if one trips and falls on the
sidewalk and methods for defending
against an attacker. The club also offers
seminars for other groups on campus
throughout the year to teach some mar-
tial arts fundamentals.
Business junior Jonathan Ham-
mond, the club's recruitment director,
said that though the practices are rig-
orous, the group is very friendly and
emphasizes social skills like teamwork.
Gomes echoed Hammond's senti-
ments, saying members of Godai Ninpo
want everyone who interacts with the
group to gain some practical knowl-
edge.
"We want everyone who practices
with us to walk away with something
useful even if they're only there for one
or two sessions," he said. "We want
them to come out knowing that they are
equipped to defend themselves."
Gomes said he joined the team early

in his freshman year and has been a
member since, adding that he practices
both with his team and on his owntime.
Hammond said the benefits of mar-
tial arts extend beyond achieving physi-
cal prowess.
"There's many internal benefits,"
Hammond said. "Members learn what
fears they have, what strengths they
have ... and ultimately increase their
confidence."
Considering his own experience in
Godai Ninpo, Gomes said he and other
members have learned humility too.
"It's really easy to take what you're
learning and get in the mindset of 'Oh,
now I have this amazing skill (and) I
can do so many things,' " Gomes said.
"You really have to tone that back and
realize that what you're learning is for
practical purposes and is, ultimately, to
make you a better person, and I think
being humble is a key aspect of that."

After narrow victory in the House, Dream
Act could face uphill struggle in the Senate

0

In 216-198 vote,
House approves bill
to revamp citizenship
process for youth
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House passed legislation yesterday
to give hundreds of thousands of
foreign-born youngsters brought to
the country illegally a shot at legal
status, a fleeting victory for an effort
that appears doomed in the Senate.
The so-called Dream Act, which
passed the House 216-198, has
been viewed by Hispanic activ-
ists and immigrant advocates as a
downpayment on what they had
hoped would be broader action by
President Barack Obama and the
Democratic-controlled Congress
to give the nation's 10 million to 12
million undocumented immigrants
a chance to gain legal status.
Critics railed against the mea-
sure, calling it a backdoor grant
of amnesty that would encourage
more foreigners to sneak into the
United States in hopes of being
legalized eventually.
The Senate is expected to vote
today on whether to advance similar
legislation, but it's unlikely Demo-
crats can muster the 60 votes need-
ed to advance it past opposition by
Republicans and a handful of their
own members.
"It's an uphill struggle," Sen. Dick
Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Demo-
crat, acknowledged.

Debate on the measure was
fraught with politics. Obama has
made an intense public push in
recent days in favor of the measure,
eager to demonstrate his commit-
ment to Hispanic voters, a key vot-
ing bloc that's been alienated by his
failure to push broader immigration
legislation.
With the GOP taking control of
the House and representing a stron-
ger minority in the Senate next year,
failure to enact the legislation by
year's end dims the prospects for
action by Congress to grant a path
toward legalization for the nation's
millions of undocumented immi-
grants.
Tamar Jacoby of Immigra-
tionWorks USA, a pro-immigration
employers coalition, said the defeat
won't end Congress' attempts to
address the issue but predicted that
future legislation will look far dif-
ferent. "Anything that they're going
to do is going to disappoint compre-
hensive immigration reform advo-
cates," Jacoby said. "It's going to be
a tough haul" to tackle the subject in
the new Congress.
After the House vote, Obama
issued a statement pledging to move
forward on immigration reform and
casting the Dream Act as a way of
correcting what he called "one of
the most egregious flaws of a badly
broken immigration system."
"This vote is not only the right
thing to do for a group of talented
young people who seek to serve a
country they know as their own by
continuing their education or serv-

ing in the military, but it is the right
thing for the United States of Amer-
ica," Obama said. "We are enriched
by their talents and the success of
their efforts will contribute to our
nation's success and security."
Obama's drive to enact the leg-
islation and congressional Demo-
crats' determination to vote on it
before year's end reflect the party's
efforts to satisfy Hispanic groups
whose backing has been critical in
elections and will be again in 2012.
The legislation would give hun-
dreds of thousands of young illegal
immigrants brought to the United
States before the age of 16, and
who have been here for five years
and graduated from high school
or gained an equivalency degree, a
chance to gain legal status if they
joined the military or attended col-
lege.
Hispanic activists have described
the Dream Act as the least Congress
can do on the issue. It targets the
,most sympathetic of the millions
of undocumented people - those
brought to the United States as chil-
dren, who in many cases consider
themselves American, speak Eng-
lish and have no ties toor family liv-
ing in their native countries.
Students who would be eligible
for legalization under the bill have
fanned out across Capitol Hill in
recent days to personally lobby law-
makers to back it. A group of them
was seated in the House gallery to
watch the vote, and they broke out
in cheers, some embracing each
other as the vote on passage was

Secretary Janet Napolitano, gestures during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. to discuss the Dream Act.

announced.
Earlier, Democrats took to the
House floor to paint the measure as
a matter of basic decency.
"Have a little compassion," Rep.
Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said, directing
his remarks at the GOP. "These chil-
dren came here, they didn't decide
to come here. They know no other
country. Some of them don't even
know the language of the coun-
try in which they were born, and
they deserve to have a right as free
Americans."
Their pleas did little to move firm
Republican opposition.

"It is not being cold-hearted
to acknowledge that every dollar
spent on illegal immigrants is one
dollar less that's spent on our own
children, our own senior citizens
and for all those who entered this
society who played by the rules,
who paid their taxes and expect
their government to watch out for
their needs before it bestows privi-
leges and scarce resources on ille-
gals," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif.
Just eight Republicans joined
Democrats to back the bill, while
more than three dozen Demo-

crats broke with their party to vote

U.S. military criticizes China for North Korea violence

United States military
chief tells Beijing it
has failed to decrease
tensions in the region
TOKYO (AP) - Turning up the
pressure on China over the military
crisis on the Korean peninsula, the
top U.S. military chief said today
that Beijing has failed to live up
to its role as a global power by not

doingenough to defuse tensions.
Adm. Mike Mullen, on a brief
stopover in Tokyo after visiting
Seoul, said it is imperative China
do more to lead North Korea away
from escalating the threat of an all-
out war, which he said would be
calamitous.
North Korea launched a recent
artillery attack on an island near
a disputed border area that killed
four South Koreans and is blamed
for the deadly sinking of a South
Korean warship in March.

"China must lead and guide
North Korea to a better future,"
said Mullen, who is chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"There is too much at stake for this
sort of myopia.
"There is no country in the world
that has more influence in Pyong-
yang than China," he said. "That's
part of responsible leadership.
That's part of being a global power.
And I would hope they heed this
call and do that."
North Korea, which has few

other allies, depends heavily on
China for economic assistance and
diplomatic support. China fought
on North Korea's side during the
1950-53 Korean war.
Beijing has been cautious in
placing blame or deciding punish-
ments for the skirmish and war-
ship sinking, and has instead called
for all sides to exercise restraint.
China has suggested more mul-
tilateral talks to deal with North
Korea's actions and concerns over
its ongoing effort to develop nucle-

ar weapons.
China has also been critical of
U.S. military exercises in the Yel-
low Sea that were conducted after
the artillery attack, in part to send
Pyongyang a message of U.S-South
Korean cooperation and resolve
not to be cowed by North Korean
belligerency.
Beijing was wary of the exercises
because they took place relatively
close to Chinese shores.
Mullen defended the exercises
as "transparent," said they were

planned well in advance of the
increased tensions, and added that
the U.S. has the right to operate in 0
open seas.
He also said he believed that U.S.
allies in the region should carry
out more multilateral maneuvers.
In particular, he said he supports
Japan joining in drills with the U.S.
and South Korea.
Mullen said the lack of military-
to-military ties between Beijing
and Washington is another source
of insecurity.

Vote delayed on
health benefits for
same-sex couples
The Michigan Civil Service
Commission is postponing action
on a proposal that could allow
same-sex partners or other adults
living with state employees to be
covered by state-paid health insur-
ance.
The proposal was tabled yester-
day because commission members
had questions about it. The propos-
al could be revisited early next year.
The proposal could cover boy-
friends, girlfriends or other adults
who have lived with a state employ-
ee for at least 12 months. Children
of the adults who aren't state work-
ers also would be covered by the
insurance.
The state had agreed in 2004
to begin covering same-sex ben-
efits but implementation has been
delayed because of legal issues.
The extension could cost about
$6 million in 2011. Opponents
worry a state government already
facing a projected deficit can't
afford it.
"When it comes to creating jobs,
government hasn't gotten the job
done," he said.
NEW YORK
NYC mayor: White
House, state leaders
fail to create jobs
New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg lashed out at the White
House, Congress and state leaders
yesterday for what he called failed
attempts to create jobs, accusing
both parties of being too distract-
ed by partisan politics to address
unemployment.
The billionaire mayor, who has
been mentioned as a long-shot pres-
idential candidate but has repeat-
edly said he doesn't plan to run in
2012, delivered a campaign-style
speech in Brooklyn. He spent half
his time reiterating familiar com-
plaints about partisan gridlock and
the other half outliningvague ideas
to get more Americans working.
Bloomberg, who has been a
member of both parties and is now
unregistered, also carefully bur-
nished his bipartisan credentials
- equally praising and criticizing
the beliefs and approaches of Dem-
ocrats and Republicans.
He blamed both parties for
unfairly vilifying the concept of
success and for too quickly dis-
missing the idea of cooperating
within government and across
party lines.

14 former Chilean
officials charged
with kidnapping
A French court put 14 former
Chilean officials on trial in absen-
tia yesterday over the disappear-
ance of French citizens under the
regime of Chilean dictator Augus-
to Pinochet.

The 14, mostly former high-
ranking military officials, face
charges including kidnapping and
torture and are the subject of inter-
national arrest warrants. They face
up to life in prison, if convicted.
While the defendants did not
appear in court yesterday, fami-
lies of the victims hope the trial
offers some justice more than 30
years after the four Frenchmen
disappeared - and four years after
Pinochet himself died following
failed efforts in Chile and abroad
to prosecute him for human rights
abuses.

Irish leader's
remarks come day
after $8-billion
proposed budget cut
DUBLIN (AP) - A defi-
ant Irish Prime Minister Brian
Cowen vowed yesterday to
push through Europe's tough-
est slash-and-tax budget in the
face of voter fury, then defy the
odds to win re-election despite a
debt disaster that has shaken the
entire eurozone.
Cowen mounted a vigorous
defense of his embattled lead-
ership a day after lawmakers
narrowly backed a 2011 budget
containing 66 billion ($8 billion)
in cuts and tax hikes that will take
an estimated 63,000 ($4,000) per
year out of average Irish house-
holds.
The unprecedented scale of the
budget-tightening was a key con-
dition for Ireland's recent agree-
mentofa 67. Sbillion ($90billion)
EU-IMF rescue fund to help Ire-
land cover its European-leading
deficit and revive its debt-struck
banks. The Irish were forced to
take aid after its two-year strug-
gle to prevent the collapse of Dub-
lin banks proved impossible to
finance on their own.
Cowen - whose public approv-
al ratings have recently fallen to
a record-low 8 percent - insist-
ed he wouldn't resign, as many
lawmakers have expected, and
instead would lead his party into

an early springelection. All recent
polls suggest Cowen's long-ruling
Fianna Fail party faces decima-
tion in any national test.
Tuesday night's initial pas-
sage of the Irish budget package
offered temporary relief for the
16-nation eurozone, where Por-
tugal, Spain and Italy have faced
mounting questions about their
own capacity to keep financing
their own debt mountains. Euro-
pean and IMF chiefs sought a
bailout for Dublin, in part, to stem
investor fears of a debt-default
domino effect.
Yesterday's yields on 10-year
bonds were little changed for the
eurozone members rated most at
risk of an eventual default, par-
ticularly Greece, which in May
became the first eurozone mem-
ber to be saved from bankruptcy.
The most significant mover
was Germany, whose benchmark
bonds suffered a moderate selloff,
driving their 10-year yields above
3 percent for the first time since
May's Greek crisis. Traders said
the selling reflected investors'
increased appetite for higher-risk
bonds versus the Germans' top-
rated and consequently low-yield-
ing debt securities.
The euro common currency
also held its ground, rebounding
from a day low of $1.3189 to rest at
$1.3250 in late trade.
In Geneva, the International
Monetary Fund's managing direc-
tor Dominique Strauss-Kahn said
the euro would not break up but
that its rules and governance need
improvement.

Serbia refuses to
honor recipient of
Nobel Peace Prize

Obama's plan for peace
in Israel faces setback

Nomination
criticized as radical
political move
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Ser-
bia's decision to boycott the Nobel
Peace Prize ceremony honoring
imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu
Xiaobo triggered criticism yester-
day from human rights activists
and the European Union - which
expressed shock that the can-
didate for EU entry would meet
China's demands.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk
Jeremic said Serbia "pays extreme
attention to the violations of
human rights," but that its bilat-
eral relations with China have
priority.
China has vilified the 54-year-
old democracy advocate Liu,
called the Nobel prize choice an
effort by the West to contain its
rise, disparaged his supporters
as "clowns," and launched a cam-
paign to persuade countries not to
attend Friday's ceremony in Oslo.

Eighteen countries, including
Serbia, Russia and Pakistan, have
turned down the Nobel commit-
tee's invitation to send represen-
tatives to the ceremony.
Serbia fears its attendance
could anger China, which has
supported Belgrade in opposing
the 2008 independence decla-
ration of its former province of
Kosovo. Some 70 nations, includ-
ing the U.S. and most EU states,
have recognized Kosovo's state-
hood, but Russia and China have
stood firm in supporting Serbia in
its claim over the territory.
Jelko Kacin, in charge of the
European Parliament's evaluation
reports on Serbia's bid to join the
EU, said he was "shocked" by Bel-
grade's decision not to attend the
ceremony.
"There is no candidate country,
or potential candidate country,
that in this way manifests its obe-
dience" to China, Kacin said.
The EU said on yesterday it will
seek talks with the Serbian gov-
ernment to persuade it to change
its mind.

U.S. had been trying
to convince Israel to
freeze settlements
JERUSALEM (AP) - The U.S.
decision to abandon its efforts to
coax a settlement freeze out of
Israel marks the biggest failure
yet in the Obama administration's
much-trumpeted Mideast peace
push, casting serious doubts over
whether the president can broker
a deal by his September target.
Israelis and Palestinians said
yesterday that a scramble was
on for a magic formula out of the
impasse. But neither side showed
any flexibility, and the Palestin-
ians voiced new signals about
trying to establish a state without
Israel's agreement.
The U.S. announced late Tues-
day that after weeks of efforts, it
had given up its attempts to per-
suade Israel into renewing a lim-
ited freeze on Jewish settlement
construction in the West Bank
and east Jerusalem - an issue that
has emerged as the key sticking
point in Mideast peace talks.
Some 500,000 Israeli settlers
now live in these areas, which
were captured in the 1967 Mideast
War and are claimed by the Pales-
tinians.
With a freeze needed to draw
the Palestinians back to the
negotiating table, Tuesday's U.S.
announcement was in effect an
admission of failure.
"There is no doubt that there is
a crisis, a difficult crisis," Pales-
tinian President Mahmoud Abbas
told a news conference in Greece.
A top aide to the Palestinian
president, Yasser Abed Rabbo,
went so far as to question Wash-
ington's ability to broker a deal,

asking how the Americans could
possibly "make Israel accept a
fair solution" when they couldn't
even make it limit its settlement
activities. "This is thebig question
now," he said.
The current round of nego-
tiations collapsed in late Septem-
ber, just weeks after they were
launched, when a previous Israe-
li settlement slowdown expired.
The Americans had hoped a
new, 90-day freeze would allow
the sides to work out a deal on
their future borders. Such an
arrangement could make the
settlement issue irrelevant, since
Israel could resume construction
in territories it expects to keep
while halting building in areas
given to the Palestinians.
The latest setback drew state-
ments of concern from Europe.
Abbas' rival, the Hamas militant
group, which controls the Gaza
Strip, called on the Palestinian
leader to stop the "futile" nego-
tiations.
But international Mideast
envoy Tony Blair said the U.S.
move was a "sensible decision
in light of the impasse that we
reached," adding that all sides
remain determined to negotiate
a peace deal.
Ron Dermer, a top aide to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said Wednesday that
the American efforts had failed
because of fears of what would
happen after another freeze
ends.
"The Americans probably real-
ized that the proposal of 90 days
to get a border agreement - a
Palestinian expectation - could
lead to a dead end and failure of
the talks," he told Army Radio.
Netanyahu, who heads a coali-
tion dominated by hard-line and

religious parties sympathetic to
Jewish settlers, appears unlikely
to bend.
"The whole idea of the settle-
ment freeze for negotiations was a
mistake," said Israeli analystYossi
Alpher.

panda Express is certainly delicious, but when dinner
options are limited and you're down to Blue Bucks to pay
for meals, orange chicken gets old quickly - and goes
straight to your hips. Currently, students can only use the Blue
Bucks that come with meal plans at on-campus establishments
like U-go's and vendors in the Michigan Unions. But recently, the
LSA Student Goverment has started to work to expand the use
of Blue Bucks to off-campus eateries. The idea is to improve stu-
dents' options and increase local restaurants' business. LSA-SG
should continue to work with the University and approach local
businesses to expand the Blue Bucks program.

According to a Dec. 6 Daily article, a
recent poll taken by LSA-SG showed that
66 percent of student respondents said
that they would eat at an off-campus res-
taurant at least one more time each week if
they could use Blue Bucks. Currently, only
University-affiliated eateries - like res-
taurants in the basements of the Michigan
League and Union, U-go's and residence
hall convenience stores like South Quad's
Chow Town - accept Blue Bucks.
Members of LSA-SG got the idea to
expand the Blue Bucks program after
visiting other universities with simi-
lar programs. Ohio State University and
Cleveland State University have food pay-
ment options like Blue Bucks, but students
there are allowed to use them as dollars
in local restaurants. LSA-SG President
Steven Benson told the Daily that he feels
confident moving forward with the change
because so many students provided posi-
tive feedback. He hopes to organize meet-
ings with officials from University Housing
to discuss the issue further.
This is a somewhat ambitious task for
LSA-SG - but the progress seen so far is
encouraging, and leaders of the project
seem to have a clear plan. When LSA-SG
takes on ventures like this, it's directly
responding to students' wants and needs,
which is exactly what a student govern-

ment should do.
Expanding the Blue Bucks program to
off-campus eateries would give students
more easy and healthy options. Blue Bucks
is money that students and their families
have already set aside for food. But right
now, students are limited to fast food that
is for the most part unhealthy. If more off-
campus establishments like Seva, Jerusa-
lem Garden and Sava's accepted Blue Bucks,
students could use their money for a health-
ier option than a Wendy's Baconator.
And local eateries would benefit, too.
Businesses that currently participate in
the program (like the Wendy's and Sub-
way in the Union) are required to return
3.5 percent of all sales to University din-
ing. But while this rate may seem high,
the benefits the businesses would receive
from increased sales outweigh the costs.
Restaurants that accept Blue Bucks would
see increased revenue and student patron-
age. They would simultaneously establish a
solid client base. Students would return to
their favorite eateries after they no longer
use Blue Bucks.
Students would have more options and
businesses could see an increase in sales if
Blue Bucks were good for more than Mrs.
Fields cookies. LSA-SG should continue its
efforts to better Blue Bucks and local busi-
nesses should sign on to the program.

Gender studies 101

ofcterribly long ago, in a place
not far away, only men were
allowed to attend college.
This was due, in
part, to the fact
that men needed
to be providers
for their families.
Usually, they were
the sole breadwin-
ners. Meanwhile,
women stayed at
home and gave
birth to and raised ERIC
children. It was a
system that worked SZKARLAT
then, but now it's
just outdated. At
this point, any per-
son has the freedom to get an educa-
tion as he or she pleases - provided,
of course, that the person has the
means to pay for it.
At some point between then and
now, universities began admitting
women. It was the way of the future
- the pinnacle of social equality
as we could conceive it. Slowly, the
opportunitiesfor women in education
caught up to the opportunities for
men. Finally, at last, we got the result
we had been waiting for: Between
2005 and 2006, women earned the
majority of post-secondary education
degrees, ranging from associates to
doctorates. Equality at last. (I'll let
you find the flaw in this logic.)
Along the road, the feminist move-
ment grew. Issues of gender became
more apparent and important. This
cultivated the need to study gender.
Out of this need grew women's stud-
ies departments. They began popping
up all over the country. To this day, the
women's studies department here at the
University is alive and well. But what I
fail to understand is what precisely it is
that makes these studies of feminism
and gender the studies of women.
There are a couple of different
ways that we could understand stud-
ies possessed by women. One such
way is that women's studies concen-
trations or courses are open only to

women. But that's simply not true.
I've taken a women's studies course
before. (Well, it was cross-listed as
an English course, but men weren't
barred from taking it.) And my Span-
ish GSI from the spring term is work-
ing toward his graduate degree in
French literature and women's stud-
ies. In any case, if the major or the
courses were open only to women, it
would be a blatant act of sexism and
the University probably would have
seen a lawsuit by now.
Another interpretation might sug-
gest that the studies are exclusively
the studies of women. But this too
doesn't seem accurate when you
consider that past women's studies
courses have discussed men's health.
Then there is another suggestion that
women's studies really means "femi-
nist studies," which really means
"We want to study gender in society."
The influence of gender in soci-
ety is a thoroughly intriguing topic.
And frankly, I'm shocked that it didn't
become a formal topic of study until
recently. But why do we consider gen-
der so exclusively female? Even the
word "feminism," purported to mean
"equality between genders," is rooted
in the feminine. I don't get that. I don't
think the study of gender is inherently
feminine any more than pencils are
inherently masculine because they are
masculine nouns in Spanish grammar.
Not only does this cultural mindset
that only women should be concerned
with issues of gender alienate men,
but it also limits the scope of gender
studies. In a general sense, academia
should be characterized by the idea
of "throw everything at the wall and
see what sticks." That's not to say that
we should take everything at face-
value, but we should at least be open
to new ideas and new perspectives. I
see women's studies as a field that is
closed to that.
In fact, the whole nature of femi-
nism seems closed to it. Sure, on paper,
feminism is defined as an ideology in
support of gender and sex equality, but
in practice, what shapes it? It's shaped

by the National Organization for
Women and women's studies depart-
ments. It's shaped by Meryl Streep's
commencement speech at Barnard
College in which she seemed to insin-
uate that all men are guilty of sexism
but are slowly adapting, and it's "about
time (laughter)." Another example is
Hanna Rosin's article in The Atlan-
tic entitled "The End of Men," which
suggests that women are simply more
adapted to a post-industrial society
and thus are subsequently thriving,
and that's hardly a problem.
What's women
about women's
studies anyway?
Very rarely do you see an organi-
zation that cries foul that men must
conscript to the draft or face fines,
or is outraged by the portrayal of
husbands on sitcoms as idiotic. You
don't hear many people outraged that
girls are consistently outperforming
boys in all levels of education. Fewer
recognize that men work the jobs
that are among the most dangerous.
Instead, they complain of a wage gap
whereby women are earning less than
men per year on average. They con-
tinue to attack the media for the stan-
dards of beauty that are unreasonably
high and impressed upon girls. And
they continue to allow women's stud-
ies, and the idea that an entire demo-
graphic has rights over another to
permeate the fabric of society.
Perhaps in the not too far future in
a not so far away place, we can realize
true equality of the sexes. Of course,
that will never happen if we don't do
something right now. And from the
look of it, no one is going to.

A MOMENT OF REMEMBERANCE

SAMANTHA TRAUBEN/Daily

LSA freshman Omar Fares participates in a group moment of silence on the Diag yesterday to remember those who have died in the Iraq War.

the space.
"I would really like to see a
large employer come in, a busi-
ness that wanted to use that as a
headquarters or an office facility,"
he said in an interview.
The prime location of the
Library Lot, between the Main
Street and State Street areas,
makes it "vital to downtown's
future as it knits together the two
primary activity areas," according
to Susan Pollay, executive direc-
tor of the Ann Arbor Downtown
Development Authority.
A committee appointed by the
Ann Arbor City Council hired The
Roxbury Group LLC, an external
consulting firm, to review the two
hotel-conference center proposals
and draft a recommendation.
According to a report prepared
by The Roxbury Group, Valiant

together a proposal and people will
listen to you, that's really what the
platform allows," McDowell said.
McDowell said MSC also pro-
vides an opportunity for out-of-
state students to gain a better grasp
of issues plaguing the state as a
whole, rather than just the college
towns of Ann Arbor and Flint.
"I think we're also hoping for a
better understanding of what the
issues are in Michigan," McDowell
said. "Not everybody who's in the
caucus grew up in Michigan. They
may have come here for college, and
they don't really know what's going
on outside their own college experi-
ence."
Many students' presentations
yesterday focused on how to incor-
porate economic stability and job
creation in a state facing budget and
economic woes. Business senior
Michael Averbook and LSA senior
Sam Hartman proposed a new
method of public transportation in
the city of Detroit that establishes
a separate lane for busing, with
sophisticated traffic lights that
would allow for quicker and more
efficient transportation.
Averbook and Hartman also pro-
posed an incentive in the form of
a tax break for those who abstain
from owning a car in order to
encourage residents to use public
transportation. They also hope that
development of the program would
help create more jobs in the Detroit
area.
"We think this will decrease
the purchasing of new cars some-
what and will encourage the use of
public transportation," Averbook
said. "This will also increase jobs
through running more bus routes
and constructing new bus lanes on
the roads."

implementation of the program,
which was scheduled to start in
Fall 2011, back to allow more time
for planning and increased com-
munity input.
"Given more time to look at vari-
ous options, we can come up with a
plan that will be more satisfying,"

AAPS administrator LeeAnn Dick-
inson-Kelley said at last night's
meeting.
Despite the criticisms, Cathy
Reishel, a clinical associate pro-
fessor at the School of Education
who is helping to lead the project,
said that if adopted, the plan would
allow for students to choose to par-
ticipate in academic enrichment
activities at the school during the
one- to two-week intersessions.
Intersessions would provide
students an "extra opportunity
to dig into interesting academic
work," Reishel said, adding that
lessons taught during the breaks
would expand on material taught

proposed 178,000 square feet of
new development, which includes
a conference center, a four-star
hotel, six high-end condomini-
ums, extensive office space, a res-
taurant and a public plaza.
The report states that Acquest
has plans for a 148,000-square-
foot development, with space for
an eight-story boutique hotel,
ground-level retail space and a
public plaza. This proposal would
eventually place a conference cen-
ter across the street at the former
YMCA site on South Fifth Avenue,
but Acquest doesn't plan to con-
struct that facility immediately.
Acquest Vice President Doug-
las Smith said in an interview that
having a separate conference facil-
ity provides the city more flexibil-
ity in terms of future expansion.
"Because (our proposal) de-
coupled the hotel and the con-
ference facility, it provided a
longer-term opportunity to grow
that conference-convention busi-

ness in order to support the down-
town," Smith said.
However, the Roxbury report,
which is available on the city's
website, found that Acquest's
proposal did not provide enough
details about the financing of the
project.
"The Acquest team chose not to
provide a specific proposal outlin-
ing how it would finance its proj-
ect, relying instead on its track
record of financing other similar
projects as evidence of its capac-
ity," the report's executive sum-
mary states.
Valiant's more comprehensive
financial strategy led the Rox-
bury Group to decisively recom-
mend the Valiant proposal for the
Library Lot site. According to the
report, Valiant offered voluntary
revisions to its original proposal,
making it a more attractive offer.
The modified scheme reduced
the size of the conference center,
added one floor of office space and

guaranteed against any financial
shortfall, eliminating debt liabil-
ity for the city.
Smith said Acquest had no
plans to revise its proposal.
According to Pollay, the city
of Ann Arbor hasn't officially
reviewed Roxbury's conclusions.
"A City Council-appointed
committee reviewed the Roxbury
report and is recommending that
the developer recommended by
Roxbury be put forward to City
Council for approval," she wrote
in an e-mail interview.
However, Hieftje says he's in
no hurry to accept a proposal
because construction isn't sup-
posed to be completed on the site
until December 2011.
"The real estate we're talking
about won't even be available for
another year and a half because
it's a big hole in the ground,"
Hieftje said in. "There's just no
rush to do anything about it given
that particular circumstance."

PETA

the class felt it was necessary.
In an e-mail interview yester-
day, a public relations official at
the University of Michigan Health
System reaffirmed UMHS's sup-
port for the course's practices.
"While nearly every aspect of
the Survival Flight course uses
simulators, for very specific
procedures, using anesthetized
animals is the only way we can
ensure our Survival Flight nurs-
es are capable and competent
enough to perform those pro-
cedures in the field on humans,
including babies," the e-mail said.
The official requested anonym-
ity because several individuals
associated with the course have
received threatening messages.
Asked why the Survival Flight
class requires live animals when
the University recently switched
to using simulator in its Advanced
Trauma Life Support class, the
same UMHS official said the
two classes were designed for
different circumstances. UMHS
stopped using live animals in its
Advanced Trauma Life Support
class, after Physician's Council for
Responsible Medicine - a non-
profit organization that advocates
for ethical methods of research -
criticized the technique.
"While physicians do perform
the same procedures, they do
so in a controlled environment
where ample back-up and support
is at hand in emergency or oper-
ating rooms," the UMHS official
wrote.
"Survival Flight nurses must
know how to do these proce-
dures correctly the first time they
are called upon to do so under
extraordinary circumstances,"
the official continued. "Nurses
in Survival Flight are called upon
to do things that even physicians
with ATLS training are not asked
to given the unique circumstanc-
es under which they are required
perform."
But Justin Goodman, associate
director of laboratory investiga-
tions for PETA, said yesterday
that the University's use of ani-
mals in the Survival Flight course
is a "relic" among peer programs.
"The University of Michigan's
Survival Flight Training course
continues to mutilate and kill
OFFICE HOURS
From Page 1A
Many of those who believe
Assange is anti-American cite
as evidence the recent release of
cables specifying sites around
the world that officials believe
are critical to U.S. security. How-
ever, in a recent New York Times
article, Assange said the goal of
WikiLeaks isn't to purport an
anti-American agenda, but rather
to push institutions to change in
order to see progress.
Communication Studies Prof.
Graham Griffith, who was at the
British newspaper The Guardian
when WikiLeaks released an ear-
lier set of confidential documents
about the war in Afghanistan in
July, said editors use a thorough
process to decide which docu-
ments to release to the public.
The Guardian was one of the
four European newspapers that

recently received the U.S. cables
from WikiLeaks.
"I left (in July) feeling very
positive about the process that
The Guardian editors and jour-
nalists went through in weigh-
ing what they should release to
the public," Griffith said. "This
is one of those things that I think
has been misrepresented. What I
can see the process being is that
WikiLeaks is releasing docu-
ments on its website after the edi-
tors at some of these papers have
looked at (them)."
"I've seen a quote from the Le
Monde editor about how (editors
and journalists) are seeing their
work up on the website, so what
editors have deemed to redact
is also carrying through to (the)
WikiLeaks site in many cases," he
said.
Though reporters and editors
are taking precautions with the
documents, government officials
have been critical of Assange
and hackers have been attacking
WikiLeaks since the site started
releasing the documents.
Collings said officials might
start becoming more cautious
about future communication
methods and protection of infor-
mation. The cables that were
released were considered "clas-
sified" - a relatively low level of
confidentiality that may prompt

cats and pigs despite the fact that
human-like simulators are avail-
able to replace the use of animals
in this course and that they've
been shown to better prepare
trainees to treat human patients
and that they're endorsed by lead-
ing medical organizations across
the country," Goodman said.
Goodman said the Air and Sur-
face Transport Nurses Associa-
tion - an organization that seeks
to advance the work of transport
nurses by enhancing the level
of patient care they provide -
recently confirmed that of the 30
institutions offering its transport
trauma courses in the country,
only the University uses live ani-
mals.
"On all counts, the use of ani-
mals in this course is- indefen-
sible," Goodman said. "It's just a
matter of time before it's going to
stop. But we're hoping that we're
able to give them a gentle nudge
and see that it's ended sooner
rather than later."
And, Goodman said, PETA's
campaign of phone calls, e-mails
and other events at the University
will not stop until the University
changes its policy.
"The campaign will continue
until the school commits to end-
ing the use of animals in the
course," Goodman said, explain-
ing that activity would likely slow
down over the holiday break. "But
when the next semester starts,
the campaign will be in full force
on campus again."
Asked about Tuesday's phone
and e-mail drive aimed at grab-
bing Coleman's attention, Good-
man said he thinks the volume of
calls would be difficult for Cole-
man to ignore.
"The inconvenience that Cole-
man's office may have had to
deal with (Tuesday) is nothing
compared to the lives of pain and
suffering that the animals in Sur-
vival Flight are forced to endure,"
he said. "If we can cause them just
a little bit of the discomfort that
animals in labs are caused, then
we're doing a good job."
PETA is not alone in its calls for
the University to end its practice
of using animals in the Survival
Flight course. The Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly passed a resolution
last month urging the University
to switch from using live animals
in the course to the simulators
used by other programs.
the government to alter the system
in the coming months.
Although Assange has suggest-
ed that the documents show U.S.
embassy officials engaged in espi-
onage for their country, there has
also been talk of trying Assange
for espionage against the U.S.
Griffith said the possibility
that Assange will be punished for
his decision to release the cables
threatens journalistic freedom.
"I'm not going to defend Julian
Assange, but the bluster about try-
ing him for espionage is something
that journalists have to find some-
what chilling," Graham said. "I
think if that's the case, then what
would stop administrations from
trying New York Times report-
ers? (Journalists) should be a little
more concerned about it than I
think a lot of them are."

Currently, WikiLeaks has
released only about 1,000 of the
250,000 cables Assange has access
to, and news sources around the
world continue to report the con-
tent of the cables.
Arbor Networks, an Ann Arbor-
based company, was able to track
the WikiLeaks site's movement as
it bounced to different domains to
resist efforts to shut down the site.
"We have a system that moni-
tors Internet traffic on a global
basis," said Kevin Whalen, Arbor's
director of corporate communica-
tions. "What WikiLeaks has been
doing is just changing the (site's)
hosting providers to more robust
providers capable of handling
(the) attacks."
In addition to garnering nation-
al attention, the leaks have also hit
closer to home at some colleges
across the country. The career ser-
vices office at Columbia Univer-
sity's School of International and
Public Affairs advised students
last week not to discuss the leak
on social networking sites because
it could lower their chances of
future government employment,
according to an article in The
Huffington Post. The career office
later backtracked and reiterated
the school's commitment to stu-
dent free speech.
Promoting open discussion on
the issue, University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said the Universi-
ty "believe(s) a vigorous, informed
discussion of important, current
topics is good for all of us."

SALAM RIDA/Daly
Samanatha Hawkins, Michigan Municipal League staff member, talks possible improvements to students' proposals yesterday.

Samantha Harkins, staff mem-
ber of the Michigan Municipal
League and member of the House
Commission on Civic Engagement,
said the pair's proposal is crucial to
economic development in Detroit,
especially since it is one of the few
cities in the country without a pub-
lic rail-system.
"At municipal, we love pub-
lic transportation" Harkins said.
"Detroit is the largest metropolitan
region in the country without some
sort of public rail transit and that
hurts us."
Harkins advised that the pair
focus especially on job development
because it is a major issue among
state legislators that transcends
party lines and could lead to poten-
tial widespread support in the state
legislature.
"The word jobs is like crack in
Lansing," Harkins said. "Everybody
is talking about jobs on both sides of
the aisle and everyone wants more
jobs."
According to McDowell, another
in class and would focus on read-
ing and math.
The partnership with AAPS
would offer student-teachers from
the University the opportunity to
work in a collaborative environ-
ment with University faculty and
teachers at Scarlett and Mitchell.
It would also allow teachers and
students from different grades to
interact, particularly when sub-
ject matter overlaps in the cur-
riculum.
"We could imagine, for example,
8th graders participating with 5th
graders in some kind of explora-
tion of the First Continental Con-
gress," Reishel said.
But not everyone is as excited as
Reishel about the partnership. Par-
ents and members of the commu-
nity raised several concerns about
the program at the AAPS Board of
Education meeting last night.
One main point of concern was
the change to a blIanced calendar,
which one parent said was incon-
siderate.
"Our family time is precious to

important aspect of MSC is that it
gives students like Averbrook and
Hartman firsthand exposure to the
processes and logistics involved in
the legislative process at the state
level.
"It's easy to say that everyone
should do x and y, that everyone
should eat healthier, but to actu-
ally make a proposal that takes
into account what exactly you want
the legislation to do is not as easy,"
McDowell said.
Jeff Kupperman, associ-
ate professor of education at the
University's Flint campus and co-
facilitator of MSC, said the program
gives legislators the opportunity to
hear from a group of youth constitu-
ents - a voting group that is often
underrepresented.
"Legislators often tell us (the
program) is really special because
the proposals are really well-
researched, and they're not just
somebody saying it ought to be a
law," Kupperman said. "The caucus
has spent weeks and months work-
us," said Elizabeth Baker, whose
child attends Ann Arbor Public
Schools. "Summertime allows my
son to be happy, well-rounded and
relaxed."
Parents were concerned with
the logistical challenges they may
face when one child attends Mitch-
ell or Scarlett and another attends
any of the other district schools
operating under a traditional cal-
endar. As the plan stands now, the
balanced school year would not
apply to Scarlett's feeder schools:
Pittsfield, Carpenter or Allen ele-
mentary schools.
Reishel acknowledged the con-
cern.
"There is no question that it
would be difficult for families to
have kids on two different sched-
ules - not impossible, but it would
be different," she said.
Reishel added that while a bal-
anced school year may be new to
the Ann Arbor school district, it is
not a new concept. There are over
3,000 schools across the country
using such a schedule, she said,

ing on these proposals and deliber-
ating on them."
McDowell echoed his senti-
ments, saying that the caucus allows
state representatives to learn about
the problems that affect students,
a perspective they don't normally
hear on the House and Senate floors.
"It provides a steady stream of
ideas and concepts," McDowellsaid.
"It's another constituency that's not
lobbyists, not corporations and not
representatives that are giving ideas
of what should be passed." .
In the past, MSC representa-
tives submitted proposals that have
influenced state law. Successful
proposals include the designation of
texting while driving as a primary
offense rather than a secondary
offense - a bill that was passed into
law this March.
"We have had resolutions that
have become law; some have started
here and some have dovetailed with
initiatives that were brought up by
other constituencies," Weisserman
said.
including schools in Grand Rapids,
Mich.
But some parents at the meeting
voiced their support of the part-
nership.
"I believe that the balanced cal-
endar does not shut out the whole
summer," said Gloria Yamas,
whose children attend Scarlett. "I
know that it may be uncomfortable
as most change is uncomfortable to
people, but the benefits to our chil-
dren, to me, are unending."
At the meeting, Scarlett Princi-
pal Gerald Vazquez cited research
published in the "Review of Edu-
cation Research" that suggests
students lose much of what they've
learned during the academic year
over the summer months - partic-
ularly in the areas of reading and
math - in a phenomenon termed
the "summer slide."
officials chose Mitchell and
Scarlett as sites for the project,
Mitchell Principal Kathy Scarnec-
chia said, due to a discrepancy in
students' performance and their
diverse ethnic backgrounds.

Tuition tangle tests mettle of British coalition


0

Lawmakers will
vote today on
proposed tripling of
university tuition fees
LONDON (AP) - Britain's coali-
tion government faces a reality
check today when lawmakers vote
on an unpopular proposal to triple
university tuition fees, a plan that
has brought students into the streets
protesting about a broken campaign

promised.
The vote poses a crucial test of
the viability of the Conservative-led
partnership with the Liberal Demo-
crats and casts an uncomfortable
spotlight on Deputy Prime Minister
Nick Clegg, who like other Liberal
Democrat candidates signed a pre-
election pledge to oppose any such
hike.
In the coalition agreement,
the Liberal Democrats reserved
the right to abstain in any vote to
raise tuition fees. That created an
awkward position for Business

Secretary Vince Cable, a Liberal
Democrat, who at one point sug-
gested he might abstain from voting
for the proposal eventhough itcame
from his office.
While Some Liberal Democrats
in the House of Commons have
declared their opposition, but that is
unlikelyto blockthe hike.
"The real danger for the govern-
ment is not that they won't pass it
through, but that it will be a policy
fiasco," said Patrick Dunleavy, pro-
fessor of political science at the Lon-
don School of Economics.

"By picking this fight with the
student body ... the government
seems to have gotten itself into
choppy water," he said.
All of this has made Clegg one of
the least popular politicians on uni-
versity campuses.
Prime Minister David Cameron's
government defends the move as
a painful necessity to deal with a
record budget deficit and a sputter-
ing economy. To balance its books,
the U.K. passed a four-year package
of spending cuts worth 81 billion
pounds ($128 billion), which will

lead to the loss of hundreds of thou-
sands of public sector jobs and cut
or curtail hundreds of government
programs.
The government proposed rais-
ing the maximum university tuition
fees in England from 3,000 pounds
(about $4,700) a year to 9,000
pounds (about $14,000). Students
reacted with mass protests that
have been marred by violence and
have paralyzed some campuses.
Reacting to the protests, the gov-
ernment modified its plan by raising

games this season.
Against Harvard last Thursday,
the sharpshooter single-hand-
edly kept the stalling Michigan
offense in the game with his 16
second-half points, en route to a
65-62 victory. And to top it off,
Novak had a double-double in
that game as well - 12 points and
11 rebounds.
"This young man right now - I
think he scored 18 or 20 against
Ohio State as a starter - and
now he's coming off the bench,"
Beilein said. "That's the team-
work; that's the unity that we're
looking for. With Stu being able to
do that, now other people believe
(in our depth)."
And even with Novak and Dou-
glass thriving from their respec-
tive position changes, the switch
hasn't been perfect.
So far this season, Novak has
shot at a woeful 31-percent clip
from the field, which is signifi-
cantly less successful than in
each of his previous two sea-
sons. But if he can turn it on
from 3-point range like he has in
the past, expect more good from
these changes to come.

By BRIAN MECHANICK
Daily Sports Writer
If you were standing on the side-
lines ofAkron's Lee R. Jackson Field
on Oct. 19, you would have laughed
at the idea that the visiting team
would eventually earn a College
Cup berth six weeks later. The Zips
trounced Michigan 7-1 that night -
Akron's biggest margin of victory
all season - as the visitors traveled
back home with their confidence
and direction in doubt.
But Friday, the Wolverines will
stand across the field from the Zips
in Santa Barbara, Calif., with a trip
to the NCAA final on the line. Mich-
igan is the clear underdog.
But with a nine-game winning
streak since the loss to Akron,
which includes road upsets of
No. 10 South Carolina and No.
2 Maryland, the Wolverines are
undoubtedly a stronger team than
they were in Akron. But how much
stronger?
MICHIGAN'S FORWARDS VS.
AKRON'S CENTER BACKS
Akron has been buoyed all year
by one of the nation's best defens-
es, boasting the nation's sixth best
goals-against-average. The defense
is organized around its two U-20
U.S. National Team center backs,
sophomores Zarek Valentin and
Chad Barson. Both players are
quick, have great composure and
positioning and have a special talent
for distributing balls forward to the
Zips' forwards.
Michigan freshman Soony Saad
and senior Justin Meram are the
attacking force for the Wolverines.
They have combined for 35 goals
this season and have accounted for
75 percent of Michigan's scoring
prodcution.Merampossesses afear-
lessness in beating defenders and a
poacher's mindset while Saad has
garnered attention as the nation's
second-leading goal scorer with his
howitzer shot from anywhere in the
attacking half.
Akron's pair both stand at under
six feet, which could open up
the aerial game for 6-foot-i-inch
Meram. Michigan's forwards will
have to get the better of the match-
up in order to win.
EDGE: Push
MICHIGAN'S WINGERS VS.
AKRON'S FULLBACKS
Perhaps the best player on
Akron's team, star junior right back
Kofi Sarkodie, is a dynamic force
attacking down the wing, as his
hat trick against the Wolverines
in October showed. Akron's whole
formation is based around Sar-
kodie's bombing runs, so the Wol-
verine left winger (likely senior
Alex Wood or freshman Fabio Per-
reria) will have to double down in
tracking back on defense.
The Michigan right wingers
matched up against Akron left back
Chad Korb should be a much more
quiet affair. The more defensive
left back should swallow up red-
shirt junior Adam Shaw's attacks
down the wing.
Michigan will likely try to play
 the ball in the middle of the park
to avoid the intimidating Zip full-
backs, but expect Sarkodie to
wreak havoc again.

schedule so far. Besides Marquette,
Michigan has only lost to ranked
teams, including No. 5 Xavier, No. 8
Texas A&M and, most recently, No.
19 Iowa State on Dec. 5.
"Our kids have to know what it
takes to be a good program," Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth said after
beating Wake Forest on Dec. 1. "You
have to be able to play good teams."
Staying true to that sentiment,
Michigan (4-4) will take on another
tenacious opponent when undefeat-
ed Kansas (8-0) comes to Ann Arbor
on Thursday night.
The Jayhawks feature a high-
octane offense that averages 85.3
points per game, good for ninth in
the NCAA. They are led by two for-
wards, 6-foot-3 sophomore Carolyn
Davis and 6-foot-2 junior Aishah
Sutherland. Davis averages 19 points
per game and Sutherland averages
close to a double-double with 12.9

points and nearly 10 rebounds per
game.
Kansas may have a size advan-
tage and two scoring threats in the
post, but size mightnotplay as big of
a role as it could in Thursday's game.
The Wolverines' biggest defensive
issue all year has been stopping the
opposition's outside shooting, not
its inside scoring, which is surpris-
ing for ateam whose starting center
stands at 6-foot-1.
Michigan held the Cyclones to
18-percent shooting from beyond
the arc in last week's contest and
only trailed by two points entering
the second half. But the Wolverines
surrendered seven 3-pointers in the
second frame and went on to lose,
60-47.
In Michigan's most impressive
win this season, it held a vaunted
Wake Forest team to 15 percent
from beyond the arc in the second
half en route to a 91-58 victory. The
key to that victory was defense
against the deep ball, and Thursday
night's game will most likely depend
on defense once again.
The Wolverines play a high-risk,
high-reward defense that creates a
lot of turnovers but also gives up a
lot of points.
"We are going to really have to
get after them defensively and force
them to make turnovers," senior
guard Veronica Hicks said before
the season. "So our pressure is going
to have to be great."
The Wolverines have been incon-
sistent on offense this year, espe-
cially in their last two games. After
scoring 91 points against the Demon
Deacons, Michigan was held to just
47 points against Iowa State.
Granted, the Cyclones feature
the 13th-ranked defense in the
country.
In Borseth's last three years as
Michigan's head coach, the Wol-
verines are 40-13 whentheir oppo-
nent scores fewer than 60 points.
When their opponents do score
more than 60 points, Michigan is
11-35. That means Michigan will
have to play some great defense
if it wants to hand the Jayhawks
their first loss of the season.

Technically speaking, The Big
Chill at the Big House will be an
outdoor hockey game between
Michigan and Michigan State on
Saturday in Michigan Stadium.
But while the Dec. 11 game is
the main event,
the Big Chill has NOTEBOOK
become a week-
long hockey spectacle involving
more than just the 40-or so roster
members of the CCHA opponents.
Even Michigan coach Red
Berenson, who insists on staying
focused on preparing his team for
Saturday's game, couldn't help but
appreciate how the University has
used the Big Chill to create "a whole
hockey community event."
"It has really grown into ... not a
monster, but a big event," Berenson
said last Thursday.
From the three Ann Arbor pub-
lic high schools, to Michigan's and
Michigan State's club teams, to for-
mer 1998 Wolverine captain Matt
Herr's prep team from Connecticut,
the University has been made the
Big Chill rink accessible to local and
special programs.
More than 25 teams will have
played on the ice before Saturday's
game. Students and fans will then
have the opportunity to participate
in an open skate on Sunday.
Michigan alum Mike Hagen is
the head coach of Ann Arbor's Sky-
line High School prep team, and
although his team was defeated
4-1 on Sunday by Ann Arbor pri-
vate school Gabriel-Richard, Hagen
knows the opportunity to play
hockey in Michigan Stadium was
unforgettable for his young team.
"The University opened the place
up to the public," Hagen said. "It's
really gracious of them to do that.
It's just big for hockey, its big for the
community. It just brought a lot of
attention to hockey in general, and
it generated a lot of excitement for
all these teams. These guys came,
walked out of the tunnel (Sunday),
looked up there in the stadium and
their eyes were as big as saucers."
PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS:

ARIEL BOND/Daily
The Michigan club hockey team plays against Michigan State's club hockey team on Tuesday night in "The Little Chill."

While the University made a point
of incorporating the local hockey
community into the week leading
up to the Big Chill, Saturday will be
all about entertaining the 113,000
people expected to be in atten-
dance.
In addition to pre-and post-game
fireworks shows, there will be fire-
works launched from each endzone
each time the 12th-ranked Wolver-
ines score. The post-game fireworks
display will even be set to music
from the movie The Big Chill. Both
teams will remain on the benches
after the end of the game to see the
post-game show. And the writers of
the 1983 movie - one of whom is a
Michigan alum - will drop a cer-
emonial puck at center ice before
the game.

When asked 'Why fireworks?,'
Assistant Athletic Director for Mar-
keting and Promotions Mark Rior-
dan didn't hesitate.
"It's an event," Riordan said.
"(Fireworks) just make it even bet-
ter. You think about it being in sec-
tion 29, row 98, you're not going to
see all the action. But the fireworks
are partof the event. You're going to
leave here thinking, 'That was awe-
some."'
When Riordan called the Big
Chill an event, he wasn't kidding.
Michigan contacted the Guinness
World Records last year to make
sure there would be representatives
in attendance for Saturday's game,
as it is projected to be the most
attended hockey game in history.
"One of the best things the last

three weeks (has been) dealing
with the Guinness records people,"
Riordan said. "We had to talk to
people in London to make sure 4
they're comingoverto get this thing
justified and make sure it's a Guin-
ness record. We can only go for one
record, and it's the largest hockey
game record. The 77,000 that was
in Germany this summer is the one
that we're goingto beat." 4
NOTES: Michigan's and Michi-
gan State's club hockey teams faced
off in a gamed dubbed "the Little
Chill" on Tuesday Night. The W61-
verines club team lost to the Spar-
tans club team, 3-2.... After practice
on Wednesday, Berenson said there
is still no decision on which senior
netminder will start in goal for
Michigan on Saturday.

and Loewe. Gershwin and Ger-
shwin. Lloyd Webber and Rice.
Since drama was first set to music
in ancient times, the relationship between
composer and librettist has been a sacred
partnership, resulting in some of the greatest
works of opera and musical theater. Without
.the dynamic duo of Richard Rodgers and
Oscar Hammerstein II, we would not have
"The Sound of Music." Without the incompa-
rable pair of Lorenzo da Ponte and Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, there would be no "Mar-
riage of Figaro."
There is something unique about the joint
enterprise of two artists. What makes this
I relationship so special is the common mind-
set of the two parties involved - the com-
poser must highlight the beauty of language
in the librettist's text, and the librettist must
challenge the composer and bring out the
best in his music. When two artists "click,"
the works they generate are unparalleled.
While time has produced hundreds of
such partnerships, one pair seems to stand
above the rest - librettist W.S. Gilbert and
composer Sir Arthur Sullivan. For 25 years,
these comedic gods of the late 19th century
had British theater-goers in stitches with
their zany, madcap operettas.
To this day, Gilbert and Sullivan's works
are cherished by music lovers worldwide.
Societies across the globe - from Spain to
Israel to South Africa to New Zealand - are
devoted to performing the operettas of Gil-
bert and Sullivan. Ann Arbor happens to
boast the oldest of North American societies:
the University of Michigan Gilbert & Sulli-
van Society.
When it was founded in 1947, UMGASS
made its mission clear: its first-ever program

reads, "In time we hope to get through all
their works, the less well-known ones as well
as the ones to which everyone comes already
humming the tunes."
Since its founding year, the society has
reached its goal of performing the entire
13-work canon of Gilbert and Sullivan oper-
ettas. UMGASS puts on at least two shows a
year, and sometimes even a third during the
summer. Starting this Thursday, UMGASS
will present an earlier G&S operetta, the 1877
hit "The Sorcerer."
'LOVE LEVELS ALL'
For newbies unfamiliar with Gilbert and
Sullivan, UMGASS's upcoming performance
is a perfect starting point.
"The Sorcerer" takes place in the small
English town of Ploverleigh, where lead
characters Alexis Pointdextre and Aline
Sangazure have been engaged to be married.
Alexis, enthralled with the matrimonial bliss
his engagement has brought him, wants all of
the villagers to share in his joy.
"So (Alexis), who has more money than
sense, hires a sorcerer to give a love por-
tion to the entire village so they can enjoy
the same happiness they have," said "Sor-
cerer" director Mitchell Gillett, an electron
microscopist in the ophthalmology and
Visual Sciences department of the medical
school. "After the potion is given, hilarity
ensues, as it were. Everything is all con-
fused - old men are with young ladies, rich
with poor, lower class with upper class, etc.
People who were in love with other people
are now in love with different people, and
some of them are not too happy about it."
When the situation becomes serious,
Alexis realizes the potion must be reversed

and the village returned to normal. How-
ever, this requires a sacrifice from the sor-
cerer, resulting in a hilariously dark ending.
Gillett pointed to an important theme of
the work that appears in several other G&S
operettas - that love levels all ranks. In
class-conscious Victorian England, society
was governed by the laws and etiquette of
social status. Gilbert and Sullivan, however,
radically challenged these social norms by
G&S have got this
witty humor that
still appeals to modern
audiences.
-Ali Kahn
pairing rich characters with poor characters.
Gillett explained that this is especially true
in "The Sorcerer," in which social distinc-
tions are totally obliterated when the villag-
ers are given the love potion.
"Even though Gilbert returns everything
back to the status quo, he's kind of shown
that the status quo isn't necessarily always
the very best thing," Gillett said.
Gillett made the decision to update the
production to the 1920s, mentioning that
this was one of the last time periods in Eng-
land when social status was still important.
"Within a few years we were going to
have the Depression and world war, and
by the end of all that there was no problem
with a duke marrying a chorus girl in a West
End show," he said.

legendary partnership 1
cepntlrv E~nvand_

ceRIy Zlgl .
Before joining forces with Sullivan in 1871,
Gilbert had made a name for himself collabo-
rating with another composer for a series of
comic operas. Likewise, Sullivan had had at
least one experience in operetta, in addition
to composing oratorios, a symphony and a
cello concerto.
Yet when these two relatively successful
artists came together in 1871, their alliance
resulted in an operatic flop called "Thes-
pis," whose score has been lost to time. But
what seemed an unpromising partnership
blossomed into a viable one when, four
years later, theatrical agent and impresario
Richard D'Oyly Carte brought the two men
together to pen the one-act opera "Trial by
Jury."
"The Sorcerer" followed "Trial by Jury" in
1877. By this time, Gilbert and Sullivan had
developed a model that would serve as a tem-
plate for their later works.
"It's really just a little gem," Gillett said of
"The Sorcerer." "It was their first full-length
show that was going to be in the style (of
their later works). They're kind of working
out some of their style at that point."
This style largely consists of musical and
social satire. G&S operettas take a tongue-in-
cheek look at British society, spoofing poli-
tics, social norms and current events.
"Every single one of their shows is a huge
farce," said School of Music, Theatre &
Dance junior Matt Peckham, who plays one

SINGLE REVIEW

The first single released from
Adele's anticipated 21 starts just
the way it should, with the young
British sing-
er-songwriter
showcasing her
best asset: that Ade
soulful voice over
light, rhythmic "Rolingin
guitar strum- the Deep"
ming. Before
the power of her pipes is allowed
to sink in, a steady bass drum
interrupts, keeping the song from
settling into a folksy ballad and set-
ting up a steady foundation for the
Motown vibe that pervades the rest
of "Rolling in the Deep."
When combined with a rhythmic
piano and '60s girl-group backup

vocals of "You're gonna wish you,
never had met me / Tears are gonna
fall, rolling in the deep," that bass
drum is a solid accompaniment
for Adele's strong, inspired vocals.
"Rolling in the Deep" breaks down
the heavy instrumentals for brief
moments of Adele singing "Turned
my sorrow into treasured gold /
You pay me back in kind and reap
just what you sow," showing more
of her savory vocals.
"Rolling in the Deep" success-
fully and seamlessly crosses genres
by moving from folk to blues to soul
and back again - a testament to
Adele's talent. If this is any indica-
tion of what we'll get from 21, we'll
be in for a treat on Jan. 24.

Example: Last
week, our merry
band of survivors reached the CDC

would the writers develop this?
Would real progress be made toward

kidnap them all and experiment on
them? Would zombies find their way

into the facility and eat everybody?
The possibilities were endless.
What we got was unimaginative
drivel. Our characters enjoy the hot
water and the powdered eggs and the
booze (why does the CDC havebooze
again?). The kids play board games.
The drunken love triangle chan-
nels "Days of Our Lives." And then
(spoiler warning) we find out thatthe
entire facility is conveniently about
to self-destruct the day after our sur-
vivors arrive. A few minutes of shoe-
horned environmental commentary
about the foolishness of fossil fuels,
another few minutes about whether

vors ride off into the sunset, hoping
for some better scripts next season.

EPISODE REVIEW

Born with the ability to only look
backward, Miss Purple Headband
has lived her life a little differently
from her peers. She puts on her
hideous, floral-patterned flocks
backward. She drives backward.
She reads and writes backward.
Needless to say, this "backward"
mindset has caused some hard-
ships in Miss Headband's life.
Inspired by her physical anom-
aly, Miss Headband also developed
a reflective, introverted mindset.
"Rescue," the exciting novel that
takes place entirely in Miss Head-
band's stream of consciousness
while she sits pensively in her ugly
yellow car, follows this troubled
woman's interweaving thoughts
as she ponders her life thus far, her
romantic entanglements (or lack
thereof) and whether she should
buy a new car that isn't so god-

URTESY OLHI ITLE, soRWN AND COMPANY
damn hideous.
Of course, Miss Headband
comes to some very shocking and
emotional conclusions which she
shares to herself, alone. In her car.
In the middle of nowhere. Miss
Headband is saved, ironically, by
her own perceived defect - her
ability to onlylookbackward saves
her so that she can move forward.
The touching story of Miss
Headband is brought to avid read-
ers by Anita Shreve, who wants to
make sure her byline can be seen
from Mars. This is Shreve's second
novel, following "A Change in Alti-
tude," which imagined the person-
al reverie of a grumpy plane taking
off into the sky and, in the process,
reaching a life-changing conclu-
sion that gave our winged friend a
positive outlook on life.

TRAILER REVIEW

Oh Mel, does the state of your
public image really depend on a
stuffed beaver? Featuring two-
time Academy
Award Winners
(as the title cards
so proudly adver- The Beaver
tise) Jodie Foster .m
("The Brave One") Summit.
and Mel Gibson
("Edge of Darkness"), "The Beaver"
is Foster's latest, greatest directorial
effort, a long-awaited 16 years after
her last, "Home for the Holidays."
And no, it's not a porno movie.
Picture this: Gibson plays the
sad-sack protagonist, hated by his
wife and kids for his angry and
abusive ways. Sound familiar? His
remedy comes in the form of a rag-
gedy beaver puppet. Said beaver

becomes fodder for therapeutic ven-
triloquism in a strange Irish accent.
Flash forward a few trailer seconds,
and the bucktoothed friend man-
ages to make its way into the work-
place, on a sweaty run and even into
the shower.
"The Beaver" is probably sup-
posed to be some beautifully elegiac
tale of redemption about a man try-
ing to communicate better with his
family. The screenplay landed on the
2008 Black List and was lauded as
one of the best unproduced scripts
of its time, so the movie might actu-
ally end up becoming a hit. But the
world just can't handle Gibson as he
heaves and hoes with the heavy lift-
ing of a big deal actor. It's just hits
too close to life.

an individual dynamic," Crescenti
explained. "It was really exciting
to see (the choreography) on their
bodies because they have such
technical prowess, so everything I
wanted looked really cool on them."
Yarrington decided to go in a
slightly different direction, cast-
ing males who had never formally
danced before - one of whom
she found dancing on the Diag -
alongside females from the Dance
Department.
"All of my dancers are complete-
ly different from each other. I have
dancers who are every size," she
said. "I wanted every kind of body
type and every kind of dancer that
I could get and see how they moved
together."
For most of the seniors, the most
challenging part of the audition
process was casting a limited num-
ber of dancers. Romita felt that the
audition was the perfect way to get
to know the department's freshmen
and was very impressed with the
underclassmen in general.
"These aren't just dancers,
they're brilliant dancers - they're
people who got into the University
of Michigan," she said. "They're
smart people, and to see them
apply that is so great. They're not
just mindlessly dancing for us, but
they're thoughtful in their move-
ment."
Armed with talented casts for
their group pieces, the seniors
embarked on their creative jour-
neys and had to cope with dif-
ferent challenges along the way.
Some of the larger difficulties for
them, whether they had to do with
choreography or emotional ties
to the piece, were faced in their
solos, which they choreographed
on themselves. Each senior was
required to choreograph one group

"I especially found (the solo)
challenging," McClendon said. "I
just had to be honest with myself.
It's really easy for me to come up
with movement for my cast to learn.
It kind of keeps me on my p's and q's
because I can't waste these people's
time, so I have to have something
for them to do. With myself, there
isn't that added pressure of some-
one else's time."
Titled "Minus One," McClen-
don's solo dance addresses his
relationship with his brother, who
recently joined the Navy.
In order to get an outside per-
spective, each choreographer chose
a faculty adviser who attended
rehearsals for both pieces and gave
advice along the way.
Sheena's adviser, Dance Lecturer

Amy West, helped her open up to
unexpected possibilities that often
arise in the creative process.
"I think the best advice she gave
me was to trust myself and have
the understanding that my danc-
ers knew the commitment they
were making when they agreed to
do my work," Sheena said. "I have a
tendency to - in my choreographic
process - to just want to get to an
objective, and it's hard to see pos-
sibilities along the way, so she was
trying to encourage me to be open
to changes and adapting. I didn't
have to be so perfect withmyvision;
I could play around with things."
In addition to the help of their
advisers, the students also received
feedback from the entire depart-
ment at a works-in-progress
showing a few weeks before the
performance. The anticipation of

COURTESY OF BRIAN ROSEN
having to present their work to
their peers and mentors adds what
McClendon and Romita call a "good
pressure" that keeps their creative
momentumgoing.
"At the works-in-progress show-
ing, watching other people watch
your choreography is so nerve-
wracking," Romita explained. "It
actually reveals a lot of things in
your dance and in your music that
you don't notice when you're so
involved in it, but then when you're
removed and you're watching other
people watch it ... I'm kind of glad
that we're in the show and I don't
have to sit in the audience, because
I think if I had to sit in the audi-
ence and be with the other people
watching my piece, I'd freak out."

hension about displaying her work

Baristas demonstrate their creativity through "latte art" and other self-expressive brews.
A caffeinated craft

Local baristas get
creative in fueling
campus through finals
ByANKUR SOHONI
DailyArts Writer
In this December exam season, stu-
dents inevitably make a habit of bundling
up and studying late into the night. And
as a comprehensive solution to the stress
of the month, there's nothing better than
coffee.
Ann Arbor and the University campus
area offer a variety of options for coffee
lovers looking for a fix or students look-
ing for a study pick-me-up. There are the
chains - Starbucks, Biggby, Espresso
Royale. And then there are the locally
owned Ann Arbor coffee shops that stu-
dents, professors and city natives fre-
quent.
The baristas in each shop are vital in
creating shop loyalty and establishing a
warm environment. They stand between
customers and their coffee and represent,
for many, a valuable part of any coffee
shop experience.
"Barista" is Italian for bartender, and in
a similar vein to their pub counterparts,
baristas often invest significant energy
in perfecting their skills to be ready for
whatever the customer may order. While
the idea of the barista may conjure images
of a blank-faced, rote assembly-line job,
a look around Ann Arbor coffee shops -
where students are often the faces behind
the counter - reveals a different picture.
"Being a barista definitely has a lot of
personality, because there's such an inter-
action with the customer," said LSA junior
and Espresso Royale barista Kristopher
Gutowski. "It's a very high-energy job."
Gutowski used to work in The Coffee
House, a small shop in his hometown of
Muskegon, Mich. While the job proper
remains the same, Gutowski said the
extraneous elements of working in each
shop are very different.
"(The Coffee House) was a lot less busy,
because it wasn't right on the corner of a
college campus," he said. "But there are

also a lot of different business practices.
At home ... I worked directly with the
owner, I talked to him, I knew him really
well. Now, there's sort of a distance."
Baristas at smaller coffee shops here
on campus echo Gutowski's feelings con-
cerning the difference between working
with the owner of a local shop or as part
of a chain.
"I haven't worked in any shops that
weren't specialty shops," said Ben Sagi-
naw, a barista at Comet Coffee in Nick-
els Arcade. "This is by far my favorite,
because ... the owner of this shop has a set
of values I can stand behind, and that's a
rarity in business. It is a requirement for
(the employees) to appreciate everything
that goes from the farm to the grocer to
the cup, which I don't think is apparent in
all coffee shops."
A concern for many baristas as they
look to advance their skills is the opportu-
nity to be creative in their jobs and infuse
their own styles into the different drinks
they make. While in larger coffee shop
chains, consistency is paramount, baris-
tas in smaller shops try to do things their
way.
"Starbucks is all about making every-
thing the same," said Jason Bies, an LSA
senior and barista at Caf6 Ambrosia on
Maynard Street. "If you get a French
Vanilla cappuccino at that Starbucks and
you go get a French Vanilla cappuccino at
another Starbucks, they're all supposed to
be the same, and that's just not what (cof-
fee is) about. It's about going places and
having your own individual thing."
Matt Roney, a 2009 graduate and for-
mer Michigan Daily staffer, is a barista at
Lab Cafi on East Liberty Street and was
the lead barista upon the shop's open-
ing in January. Having worked in coffee
shops since he was 17, Roney had the basic
barista skills. But in order to gain experi-
ence with the advanced equipment he was
going to employ at Lab, he traveled to Chi-
cago to train for the job.
Roney highlighted the specific technol-
ogy as a unique characteristic of smaller,
more personally involved coffee shops.
While using Lab's espresso machine,
he talked about the "superautomatic"
machinery that a shop like Starbucks uses.

"I'm not deriding them," he said, "but
they can push a button and out comes the
espresso shot. There are a lot more steps
that go on with a semi-automatic or a
manual espresso machine."
The more complicated techniques
associated with coffee-making in those
smaller shops, as Roney explained, allow
for more personal creativity in the final
product.
"We get to experiment a little bit with
the methods that we use, because the
owners are entrepreneurs and not baris-
tas," he said. "Those of us who have a lot
of experience and a lot of training and
have been doing this for a long time, we're
allowed to try things and work on keeping
our coffee as high quality as we can."
But even in a shop as large as Espresso
Royale, Gutowski finds the opportunity to
express himself through his work.
"It can be a creative job," he said.
"There are definitely instances where,
when it's really busy, it just seems like
the rough-and-tumble of getting custom-
ers their drink as quickly as possible. But
when there's room for creativity, you can
get creative."
One way baristas choose to be origi-
nal is through latte art, which allows the
coffee-maker to "draw" a pattern into
the layer of foam atop a shot of espresso
by pouring in steamed milk. One of these
shapes is a heart, which many baristas
strive to perfect.
At Cafd Ambrosia, Bies and other baris-
tas often experiment with new ingre-
dients and drinks, even beyond coffee.
Among these is "Purple Drink" - what
Bies described as a blueberry, raspberry
and white chocolate steamer. Another
is "Quicksand," which involves putting
cherry flavor in a bottle of Coca-Cola and
then adding cinnamon on top.
"When you're in a place like (Ambrosia),
it's not like, 'You have to make it this way,'
" Bies said. "I know what a bad cappuccino
is, and I know what a really good cappuc-
cino is, and I'm always trying to strive to
make my cappuccino really good."
No matter which shop they work in,
each barista values the same parts of his
or her job. Each shop appears to have its

I don't always understand Anne Car-

translation, collage, photography, a time

to a dead brother. I often don't know
what to make of it, butI am thankful it
has been made. As we enter an age when
readers read readers instead of books,
"Nox" demonstrates that the book itself
can still be a poetic text, an art object, an
offering, a shrine.
Deborah Digges, "The Wind Blows

(Knopf, $25)
Much poetry of our age is about as
self-consciously cool and unaffected
as a vodka martini. What a thrill it is,
then, to read poems so linguistically and
emotionally risky. When you read a poet
willing to say "Call out the names in the
procession of the loved," you know you
are in the presence of one who cares
deeply about sound and not at all about
sounding cool. Digges's poems remind
us that poetry fulfills a need; these are
poems we need now.

OK, OK, I haven't actually read this

I think, "of course it is," then realize it's

Poetry is supposed to be a young per-
son's game, and Wilbur will turn 90 years
old on March 1. I'm not goingto suggest
that he's sold his soul for poetic youth, but
here is Wilbur's description of dreams:
"a cobwebbed pane.
Where, before our eyes,
All the living and the dead
Meet without surprise."
Too often overlooked because he
failed to be one of the dramatic early
deaths of his generation, Wilbur deserves
the sort of attention he has so long given
the world.
Of course, I've overlooked a shameful
number ofgood books and poets in order
to focus on those I've mentioned here. I
hope, though, that any one of these books
will lead you to those books, and those to
others still. The volume of what's good
should compensate for my own biases.
And if you find the good or the great, I
would accept that as an adequate end-of-
semester gift.
I would also accept cash.

Pudi gets animated about 'Community'

By PROMA KHOSLA
DailyArts Writer
'Twas two weeks before Christmas,
and "Community" was new; but everyone
was animated, and Abed confused.
Tonight's "Com-
munity" will join the ~ ,
tried-and-true holi-
day tradition of stop- "Abed's
motion claymation in Uncontrollable
"Abed's Uncontrol- Christmas"
lable Christmas." NBC
The episode, writ-
ten by series creator
Dan Harmon and Dino Stamatopoulos
(who plays "Star-Burns"), follows Abed
Nadir (Danny Pudi) as he searches for
the meaning of this special, claymated
Christmas.
"Every day is so different and unique,
and once they presented this script to us
about this episode and said that we were
going to be in stop motion, I was - I mean,
we were all so excited," Pudi said in a con-
ference call last week.
S It's a claymated
Christmas, and as
expected, only
Abed knows it.
The episode begins like a normal
"Community" episode, with the only dif-
ference being the stop-motion style. As

fans would expect, Abed is the first and
only character to notice and decide the
new medium is what makes this Christ-
mas special.
"And then we go on this magical jour-
ney through a winter wonderland," Pudi
explained, "including a trip down Gum-
drop Road - which I have always wanted
to go down - and a number of other plac-
es, and I think we all learned a little bit
about the meaning of Christmas to us as a
study group."
Since the beginning of NBC's under-
stated comedy about Greendale Com-
munity College, Abed has been a clear
scene-stealer with his deadpan dialogue
and slick pop culture references. And
it's no secret that the other characters -
and most of the audience - find him a bit
eccentric.
Pudi said that before his character was
cast, Abed was supposed to be Palestin-
ian. When Pudi, who is half-Indian and
half-Polish, got the part, Abed became
half-Polish as well. Pudi grew up with
traditional Polish Catholic Christmas
celebrations, while his fictional alter-ego
grew up Muslim with Catholic and Chris-
tian influences.
"(Abed) is probably a big fan of Chevy
Chase's 'National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation,' " Pudi said. Ironically, Chase
plays Pierce Hawthorne, the elderly
Greendale student who makes Creed from
"The Office" seem normal.
For Pudi, being an animated character
in tonight's episode is just one of many
dreams that "Community" is helping him
realize.
"You know, it's very bizarre," Pudi
explained. "One day, you're working with

Pudi hopes that tonight's episode wil be the "'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' for our generation."

Chevy Chase and the next day you're
going to visit a claymation studio where
they have a doll of you.
"I met one of the ladies who was mak-
ing the doll. Actually, I saw her away from
set ... someplace in Los Angeles. She's like,
'I recognize you because I've been work-
ing on your doll.' I was like, 'That's defi-
nitely another first.'"
Stop-motion interests Pudi, who has
a dual degree in communications and
theatre from Marquette University and
previously worked in improvisational

comedy. But, he had never done voiceover
work before and found it to be a challeng-
ing way to convey emotions.
"We're all sort of kids in a sandbox in
preschool - except that we're all adults at
Greendale," he said of the new medium.
"But we're essentially doing the same
thing. We're all learning from each other
and being like, 'Well, this is how I've done
it. How do you guys do it?' And I think
that's largely the reason why we like to
celebrate holidays. Plus, they're just fun -
and there's a dance.

"And the script is really, really funny
and really sharp, but also kind of goes to
these places where, I think, with the stop-
motion, we're able to go a little bit further
in terms of, you know, even more emo-
tional depth and some of the sadness of
the characters, too," he added.
Pudi hopes that the Christmas episode
will help bring characters together in a
way that traditional episodes cannot.
"Yes, I think it's going to rival 'Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer' for our genera-
tion," he said. "At least that's our hope."

UMGASS
From Page 1B
of the principal characters in "The Sor-
cerer." "It's all basically ridiculous satire
of aspects of English life at the time ... You
get to kind of look back through that."
Surprisingly, one of the most satirical
of Gilbert and Sullivan's works is set in a
land far away from jolly old England. "The
Mikado," which premiered in 1885, paints
an exaggerated portrait of British law
and rank under the disguise of imperial
Japan. The work, which ran for 672 per-
formances, is arguably the most popular
and best known G&S operetta. It will also
be UMGASS's spring production, slated
for April 2011.
Propelling the political and social sat-
ire of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas is
W.S. Gilbert's witty dialogue and hilari-
ously impossible storylines.
"Theplots areso ludicrous,butsomehow
you believe it, and it works," said UMGASS
president Ali Kahn, a senior in the Ross
School of Business. "At the end they always
throw in this giant twist that somehow is
logical but just doesn't seem practical, and
it solves every single problem."
As an example, Kahn cited the duo's
1879 sensation "The Pirates of Penzance."
The operetta's leading man, who believes
he will be free to leave the band of pirates
he serves once he turns 21, realizes that
he was born on February 29 of a leap year.
He must therefore remain a pirate until
his actual 21st birthday, which will occur
sometime in his eighties.
"(G&S have) got this witty humor that
still appeals to modern audiences even
though (the shows) are from the late
1800s," Kahn said.
Sullivan's music also has elements of
satire, as it parodies grand opera of the
period. G&S operettas are packed with
musical jokes that reference the operas of
Wagner and Verdi. Kahn, who has stud-
ied these references, noted that Sullivan
lifted a passage from Verdi's "La Traviata"
and jokingly recycled it in a soprano aria
in "The Pirates of Penzance."
"Sullivan took (music) out of the opera
of the time or the opera right before that
and just placed it right in the score," Kahn
said. "So people in the audience would
have gotten those jokes. Now people don't
necessarily get it. But I think the music is
just so beautiful because it's a nice mix-
ture of the high opera of that period and

the way music was going into operetta."
Interestingly enough, Sullivan's ambi-
tion was to write a serious operatic work
that would rank among the operas of
the composers whom he parodied. Even
Queen Victoria herself once remarked
to the composer, "You ought to write a
grand opera, Sir Arthur, you would do it
so well." Although Sullivan did compose
an opera - without the help of Gilbert - it
never gained the same recognition as the
operettas he produced with his longtime
partner.
Despite Sullivan's unfulfilled dream,
even the composer himself could not deny
the tremendous success of his joint ven-
tures with Gilbert. The partnership of
Sullivan's playful melodies and Gilbert's
incomparable wit helped the entire canon
of G&S operettas to stand the test of time.
One hundred fourteen years after their
final collaboration, Gilbert and Sulli-
van still remain household names. Their
operettas continue to be performed inter-
nationally by societies dedicated to pre-
serving the topsy-turvy world of G&S.
G&S AT THE 'U'
Founded in the late '40s, the University
of Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan Society
is one of the most esteemed and respected
of its kind. Since its first performance, the
society has offered top-notch amateur
performances of G&S, while at the same
time educating modern audiences of this
all-too-neglected artform.
"I think it's necessary to keep Gilbert
and Sullivan going," Kahn said. "It's a
very important genre and time in history
to present to audiences. I think that if
societies like us didn't do it, (Gilbert and
Sullivan) would have a hard time finding a
home in other theater companies."
Gillett believes UMGASS is especially
important because it provides local audi-
ences a chance to see quality Gilbert and
Sullivan performances without leaving
Ann Arbor.
"This is the only company, unless you
go to Toronto or New York or Chicago or
San Francisco, that you're going to see
this level of quality of production," he
said. "For a student organization, they
produce about the most professional
production of G&S that you probably are
going to see."
At its most basic level, UMGASS is a
community of members joined by their
love for G&S, whether they are University
students, faculty or Ann Arbor residents.

SAM WOLSON/Daily

The University of Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan Society was founded in 1947 and puts on two to three shows every year.

The society offers a special niche for oper-
etta lovers who continue to participate
even after they graduate.
"It's got a ton of alumni," Kahn said.
"Over time people come up to us and say,
'I was in UMGASS in the '70s when I was
a Law student here.' And then they come
back later and they can still participate."
Kahn went on to explain that members of
UMGASS often form a supportive and close-
knit family - both figuratively and literally.
"We've got second-generation
UMGASS-ers, believe it or not," Kahn
said. "I guess at some point, there have
been one or two marriages that have
resulted. It's very much a family.
"I feel like I'm a part of the Ann Arbor
community, not just the University," Kahn
added. "I feel like the relationships I've
made are so lasting and will definitely
carry into the future after I graduate."
While UMGASS makes an effort to
pull in longtime G&S fans, the society
also tries to make the works accessible to
first-time operetta-goers. Gillett pointed
out that while they may focus on a time

and place far from our own, the univer-
sal themes and intellectual humor of G&S
will appeal to modern-day audiences and,
in particular, students.
"It's kind of lucky that Gilbert chose,
most of the time, universal subjects," Gil-
lett said. "So these aren't stories about
gods and kings - like in opera where
nobody can really relate to it."
Though the universality of G&S oper-
ettas attracts a wide audience, first-time
G&S attendees are often intimidated by
the outdated and antiquated language
that can make it difficult to follow the
story. Archaic British expressions like "at
sixes and sevens" and "yam for toko" can
throw even the most experienced audi-
ence member for a loop. UMGASS tries
to get around this barrier by providing
definitions of old-fashioned idioms and
vocabulary in the program. In addition,
supertitles are projected above the stage
during musical numbers.
"We usually try to get the singers
to enunciate really clearly, but I think
(supertitles are) an advantage for those

who are brand new to it." Gillett said.
Kahn pointed out that Gilbert and Sulli-
van may not be as foreign to college students
as one might think. In fact, pop culture is
filled with references to G&S operettas.
"I was watching a 'Family Guy' episode
the other day, and one of the songs from
'The Sorcerer' came on," Kahn said. "It's
one of those references that just appear,
and if you know what it is, it's one of those
great moments."
Kahn's run-in with G&S on primetime
television shows just how widespread and
well known Gilbert and Sullivan's works
are. While these two artists would have
most likely made names for themselves
had they worked independently, it is for- 4
tunate that they worked together to pro-
duce the some of the best-loved works of
musical theater in the English-speaking
world and beyond. When a student begins
to experience for himself or herself the
pair's perfect balance of theater and
music, it becomes evident why societies 4
like UMGASS continue to perform the
works of G&S to this day.

When founded, the goal of UMGASS was to perform all 13 of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas. This weekend, the group will put on "The Sorcerer," composed in 1877.

for everyone to see.
"As artists, we create something mean-
ingful to us, present it and we hope for the
best," McClendon said. "The scary part
is, people are going have opinions about
what you created and they may not be the
opinions you wanted them to have, but I
wouldn't want to create something that
someone was indifferent about. I actually
want you to hate it or I want you to love it;
that's the way I would prefer that it would
be."
The seven seniors will get plenty more
reactions to their work when they show-
case their pieces for choreographers,
directors, University alumni, friends
and family at the Baryshnikov Arts Cen-
ter in New York City on May 6 and 7 in a
self-produced show, a first for the Dance
Department. The brainchild of the Class
of 2011, the show has been facilitated by
the students' hard work as well as the

help of the dance faculty and Dean of the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance Chris-
topher Kendall.
"We're kind of challenging the Dance
Department to keep up with us," Nieves
said. "Even if none of us get jobs from
there, our goals are to showcase the Uni-
versity on the East Coast, to show what
we can do. That's something you can put
on your resume, that you just got out of
college and you produced a show in New
York. How many 21-year-olds can say
that?"
Each of the seniors will carry that same
ambition with them as they graduate and
face the fickle dance world. When asked
what most of them refer to as "the ques-
tion," the seniors all seem surprisingly
assured about their futures. Nieves, Romi-
ta and Yarrington hope to move to New
York City and begin performance careers,
Crescenti is applying to a contemporary
dance school in London and auditioning
in New York and Chicago, Sheena and
Wanserski will go abroad and McClendon
will pursue his second passion, singing.
"It's a little scary because a lot of our

friends who are not in the dance world
are already getting interviews; half of my
friends already have jobs," Romita said.
"You can't apply for a job in the same way
as, say, a business major does."
"(A career in dance) takes building a
community basis. You get jobs on your
own with your tech ability and with your
presence but also with who you know,"
Crescenti said. "You go into those audi-
tions with hundreds and hundreds of
people all wanting one spot, and people
who are your age, people who are younger
than you, people who have been living in
the city for years and years and are hun-
gry and tired and want this job a thousand
times more than anyone else in the room."
No matter what happens, each BFA is
optimistic about what's in store for the
future.
"I know that it'll be fine, and I love to
dance, so in some way or another some-
thing will work out," Yarrington said.
McClendon summed up the feelings of
the closely bonded class quite succinctly:
"We're going somewhere great, and we
can feel it."

own community, but every barista also
has the opportunity to connect with his
or her customers.
"The best part of my job is all the peo-
ple I get to meet and talk to. straight up,"
Roney said. "Coffee's very interesting.
I've been very interested in it for a long
time. But I think what makes me like
it more than other jobs I've had is that
face-to-face interaction with hundreds
of people every day. It's ail extrovert's
job."
In a place as unique as Cafi Ambrosia,
Bies enjoys the diversity of people that
come through the shop.
"You start learning a lot about people
who are really interesting," Bies said. "It
kind of gives you a microcosm of a com-
munity."
For Bies, that community represents a
reprieve from his academic life. Gutows-
ki also finds his job to be a healthy relief

from school, especially duringthe stress-
ful time of exams.
"It's not school, so it's also a distrac-
tion," Gutowski said. "Even when it
becomes time-consuming ... I would say
it's a fun job."
Bies, who once worked at Beanster's
in Pierpont Commons on North Campus,
finds Ambrosia to be a relaxing place to
work, with its own customer commu-
nity.
"It's totally an escape," he said. "Pro-
fessors come here, and GSIs hold office
hours here all the time. It's also where
people come to break up - two people
come in together, have a serious conver-
sation and then leave separately. It's like,
'I'm really glad we can facilitate your
breakup.'"
The ubiquity of coffee is so embodied
in campus culture that it even becomes a
part of the rise and fall of relationships.
Coffee is an integral part of many stu-
dents' daily lives, and in appreciating the
drink that runs our late-night study ses-
sions, it's best to not overlook the baris-
tas who form the lifeblood of the coffee
exchange.

The Dance BFA seniors wil take their pieces to New York City this May for a two-day showcase.
