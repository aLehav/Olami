University 
of 
Michigan 
professors are worried that an 
executive order intended to 
combat anti-Semitism poses a 
threat to their ability to teach 
about Middle Eastern conflict 
and engage with students freely 
in the classroom. 
The executive order, signed 
by President Donald Trump on 
Dec. 11, 2019, designates Judaism 
as either a nationality or a race 
and 
prohibits 
anti-Semitism, 
declaring 
certain 
language 
painting Israel in a negative light 
as anti-Semitic and illegal under 
the Civil Rights Act. 
Universities 
that 
defy 
it 
risk potentially losing federal 
funding, but leaders in the 

University’s 
Judaic 
Studies 
Department do not foresee any 
changes to their curricula and 
doubt the efficacy of the order. 
Jeffrey Veidlinger, director of 
the Frankel Center for Judaic 
Studies, said no alterations would 
be made in his department.
“We 
will 
not 
make 
any 
changes based on the Trump 
executive 
order,” 
Veidlinger 
said. “I think that’s the goal of 
the executive order, (which) is 
to have that chilling effect on 
the climate of teaching, to make 
professors afraid of things they 
would otherwise say.” 
The order follows an increase 
in anti-Semitic harassment on 
college campuses across the 
country. According to the Anti-
Defamation League, an anti-hate 
group dedicated to protecting 
Jewish 
people, 
American 

colleges and universities claimed 
an 
89 
percent 
increase 
in 
reported anti-Semitic incidents 
in 2017 compared to 2016. 
This order follows a rise 
in attacks on Jewish people 
outside of academia, including a 
shooting that killed 11 people in a 
Pittsburgh synagogue in October 
2018 and a December 2019 attack 
in which a knife-wielding man 
wounded five people gathered 
to light candles for the seventh 
night of Hanukkah at the home 
of a Hasidic rabbi.
Order 
reminiscent 
of 
previous 
controversy 
on 
campus
On 
Nov. 
14, 
2017, 
the 
University’s 
Central 
Student 
Government 
passed 
the 
#UMDivest 
resolution 
supporting 
divestment 
from 
companies operating in Israel 

due to alleged human rights 
violations. The resolution aligned 
with values of the Boycott, Divest 
and 
Sanctions 
movement, 
a 
movement started by Palestinian 
civil society groups in 2005, and 
initiated a wave of support from 
pro-divestment students, and 
conversely, dissent from many 
pro-Israel students. 
Professor Victor Lieberman, 
who declined to be quoted in 
this article, was critical of the 
BDS 
movement 
on 
campus, 
accusing pro-Palestine activists 
of stifling political discourse. In 
an open letter published in The 
Algemeiner in 2017, Lieberman 
accused 
BDS 
activists 
of 
hypocrisy after he was blocked 
from 
speaking 
during 
the 
divestment debate at the Central 
Student Government meeting.

Approximately 
50 
students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members 
gathered 
in 
Weill 
Hall 
Tuesday evening for “Hope 
and Healing,” a discussion 
of sexual violence recovery. 
The 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention and Awareness 
Center hosted the event.
Alisa Zipursky, University 
of 
Michigan 
alum 
and 
founder of Healing Honestly, 
led the discussion.
Zipursky clarified her goal 
to create a safe space within 
the community to talk about 
healing after sexual assault 
trauma. The event focused 

on 
debunking 
common 
myths 
surrounding 
the 
healing process. Zipursky 
said she hopes the event will 
inspire others.
“Tonight is more about the 
‘what now’ and ‘what next,’ 
how to live full and vibrant 
lives (as) young people while 
we deal with the real impacts 
of our trauma on our lives,” 
Zipursky said.
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
event, 
coordinators 
reminded 
attendees 
that SAPAC is a free and 
confidential 
resource 
for 
students, staff and faculty on 
campus. 
The first myth Zipursky 
focused on was the concept 
of a “real” survivor. She 
explained 
how 
various 

unique 
factors 
can 
lead 
survivors to feel silenced. 
Zipursky said many survivors 
feel increased stigmatization 
due to internal guilt or lack 
of ability to immediately 
identify their trauma.
Zipursky also explained 
how survivors who delay 
reporting sexual assaults or 
do not have clear memories 
of their assaults often fear 
that their claims will be 
perceived as illegitimate. 
“There 
are 
so 
many 
ways our survivorship is 
invalidated,” Zipursky said. 
“For me, my survivorship 
was invalidated by the fact 
that I didn’t have clear 
memories of what happened 
to me. I have what I would 
describe as body memories 

or sensory memories that are 
sometimes called somatic 
memories.”
The second myth Zipursky 
expanded on was the idea 
that college is supposed to 
be the best time of a person’s 
life. She explained how the 
pressure to have the perfect 
college 
experience 
leaves 
little space for survivors to 
make space for their pain 
and healing. 
Zipursky 
said 
while 
college should be a time 
for fun and friendship, her 
experience at the University 
also included struggle and 
pain. She said she struggled 
with 
the 
discrepancy 
between these two feelings.

In his book “What ifs of 
Jewish History: From Abraham 
to Zionism,” professor Gavriel 
Rosenfeld 
discusses 
what 
life would be like if certain 
pieces 
of 
Jewish 
history 
hadn’t happened. Rosenfeld 
examined these speculations 
of 
Jewish 
history 
at 
his 
seminar Thursday afternoon 
with around 30 students and 
Ann Arbor residents at the 202 
South Thayer Building.
Rosenfeld is a professor 
at Fairfield University and 
has written several books on 
Jewish history. Specifically, he 
poses hypotheticals, asking, 
among 
other 
things, 
what 
would have happened if Hitler 
had been assassinated and died 
prematurely. Rosenfeld read 
excerpts from his novel to help 
the audience better understand 
his ideas of how life would be if 
Hitler had been killed. 
“We 
understand 
your 
father was highly conflicted 
about 
this 
evening 
with 
the assassination of Hitler 
as 
was 
reported 
in 
the 
newspaper,” Rosenfeld read 
from the book. “In the years 
after the assassination he 
was plagued by doubt … and 
made life worse rather than 
better for your excuse. And 
as a result, we adhere to his 
decision to see the life of 
exile and millions without 
the reflective reluctance to be 
linked to an act.”

After Feb. 29, the University 
of Michigan will switch to 
using the U-M Magic Bus and 
halt all DoubleMap support.
According 
to 
Senior 
Manager of Logistics Scott 
Babut, the transition to U-M 
Magic Bus app follows the 
expiration of the contract 
with the previous supplier 
system. 
Babut 
said 
after 
pursuing 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
contracting 
process, 
Clever 
Devices 
became the new supplier, and 
Magic Bus was included in 
their system. 
According to the Logistics, 
Transportation 
& 
Parking 
press release, the new app 
will feature stop times, a real-
time map, a trip planner, the 
ability to create an account 
and tracking by text message.
Babut 
said 
creating 
an 
account in the app has helped 
many passengers plan their 
trips around campus.
“Within these accounts, 
the 
passengers 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
create 
profiles 
with their favorite route 
and stops, allowing them to 
receive information that’s 
important to them based 
on those routes and stops,” 
Babut. “We also see that it 
provides us the potential 
to 
communicate 
service 
changes and detours to a 
targeted passenger base.”

Climate Blue, a student 
organization responsible for 
organizing the University of 
Michigan’s student delegation 
to 
the 
United 
Nations 
Framework 
Convention 
on 
Climate Change Conference, 
sent a letter to University 
administrators 
on 
Monday 
outlining calling for carbon 
neutrality by 2030. 
The letter reflected on the 
delegation’s experiences at the 
conference in December 2019 
and recommended actions for 
the University to pursue in 
order to approach the growing 
climate crisis.
The organization shared the 
letter on Monday in the format 
of an email to University 
President Mark Schlissel, the 
University Regents and the 
President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality. Climate 

Blue thanked the University 
for the opportunity to send 
13 
delegates 
to 
the 
25th 
annual Conference of the 
Parties, where 197 member 
countries come together to 
discuss 
preventing 
human 
interference on the global 
climate. 
“However, despite being 
a part of such a stimulating 
and inspiring event, we feel 
disheartened by the lack of 
urgency in raising awareness 
about and addressing climate 
change locally, at UM,” the 
letter read. “As a top research 
institution globally, we have 
the capacity to be leaders on 
climate 
change 
initiatives, 
and should be using our 
resources 
to 
do 
what 
is 
morally right, not only for 
students, but also for the rest 
of the world. We strongly 
urge UM to implement the 
resolutions presented in this 
letter.”

The University of Michigan 
Central Student Government 
convened 
Tuesday 
night 
in the Michigan Union to 
discuss asking the University 
to end their contract with 
Delta Air Lines and to revise 
CSG procedures in light of 
upcoming elections. 
Medical 
student 
Whit 
Froehlich ran the meeting in 
the absence of CSG president 
Ben Gerstein, Public Policy 
junior. 
Delta 
Air 
Lines 
made 
hundreds 
of 
deportation 
flights 
for 
ICE 
in 
2019. 
The 
resolution 
sponsors 
recommend University staff 
fly with airlines that have 
refused 
to 
participate 
in 
deportation flights, including 
American, 
Southwest 
and 
United. 
Delta 
provides 
discounted 
rates 
for 
University staff. 
Rackham student Siddharth 
Singh 
Chaudhari 
raised 

financial 
and 
convenience 
concerns about eliminating 
the contract. He noted Delta 
flights are the primary way to 
get to Europe and Asia from 
Michigan. 
“In proposing to suspend 
the contract with Delta, I 
wonder if, given the reality 
of Delta’s relationship with 
DTW actually, would it allow 
University 
employees 
to 
continue to purchase Delta 
tickets 
paying 
full 
price, 
actually 
give 
them 
more 
money in the long-run instead 
of taking the discount we have 
as a result of the contract,” 
Chaudhari said. 
Social 
Work 
student 
Cecelela Tomi pointed out 
the 
greatest 
discount 
for 
University employees is about 
10 percent. She suggested 
including rate information in 
the resolution. 
“It might help to say that 
we don’t have that much 
of a financial stake in this, 
anyways,” Tomi said. 
Later 
in 
the 
meeting, 
Rackham 
student 
Hayden 

Jackson 
raised 
concerns 
about campaign finance and 
procedures 
ahead 
of 
the 
upcoming March elections. 
Assembly members proposed 
raising finance caps — the 
maximum amount candidates 
for CSG can spend on their 
own campaigns — from $50 
to $150 and removing the 
limit on CSG candidates from 
emailing listservs they do not 
control. 
“A number of the members 
of the committee expressed 
hesitation 
in 
(lifting 
the 
listserv ban), in particular 
because of the impact we 
worry it will have on the 
quality of CSG elections, the 
engagement 
that 
students 
show in CSG elections if one 
CSG candidate can simply 
win elections by emailing as 
many listservs as they have 
access to,” Jackson said. “So, 
we worry about the effects of 
that on CSG’s reputation on 
campus and the good future of 
the organization on campus.” 
Hayden 
also 
proposed 
changing rules surrounding 

campaign speech. He noted 
past CSG rules restricting 
speech have been declared 
unconstitutional, citing Ann 
Arbor’s 15th District Court 
striking down the rule barring 
candidates 
from 
declaring 
false incumbency. 
“We have a responsibility as 
a public institution of higher 
learning to keep restrictions 
on speech at a bare minimum,” 
Jackson said. “I don’t believe 
the rules on campaigning as 
they stand are compatible 
with this principle.” 
All 
resolutions 
were 
returned 
to 
the 
Rules 
Committee after discussion.
The 
Assembly 
also 
confirmed 
Law 
student 
Meghan Patero as Student 
General Counsel. 
Additionally, 
the 
CSG 
Executive 
Nominations 
Committee 
reported 
that 
she desires to stay apolitical 
as Student General Counsel 
and believes in interpreting 
governing 
documents 
regardless of her personal 
opinions.

Assembly talks terminating partnership with international flight company following ICE deportations

Central Student Government proposes 
resolution to end Delta Airlines contract

Feb. 12, 1967: Study guides for those who don’t like to read

As far as her French 232 teacher is 

concerned Connie Brown, ‘70, knows 

“La Femme Savant” cold. Miss Brown 

came through with a flat A in a recent 

exam on the French novel.

Only thing is Miss Brown never 

bothered to read the book in French. 

Instead she simply read an English 

“pony” version.

Miss Brown reflects a long-standing 

college tradition that has suddenly come 

of age. At campuses across the country 

a growing number of students are 

plunking down $1 to $3 for study guides 

on everything from Falstaff to Symbolic 

Logic.

While local book merchants are 

ecstatic about the trend, teachers here 

view the matter with alarm.

The study guide issue has generated 

so much campus controversy that 

the University Activities Center is 

sponsoring a faculty-student panel 

discussion of this issue Saturday, Feb. 

18, at the League.

Teachers fear student creativity is 

stifled by use of study guides. Prof. Bert 

Hornback of the English department 

says “the watered down masterplots are 

crutches, not study guides. They’re just 

things to learn facts from.”

He thinks a better university 

atmosphere would be created if money 

spent on study guides are spent on “beer 

and pizza” for a bull session.

Nonetheless bookstores here do a 

flourishing trade on the study guides. 

One stroe alone stocks 350 study guides 

under eight major titles. The review 

notes are “continuous good sellers” says 

a spokesman for Wahr’s bookstore.

One of the largest companies in 

the field, Monarch Press Inc, sold five 

million study guides and grossed over $3 

million last year. To uphold their claim 

that “shakespeare was never easier,” 

Cliff’s Notes offers a $1 summary, text, 

glossary, and picture book of most of 

Shakespeare’s plays.

New companies regularly join the 

field. Hornback recently received an 

offer for a new series “complete with 

display rack” that promised 50 percent 

profit to the retailer.

Hornback says the study guides 

reflect “an absurd insistence on 

research” which “destroys the goal of 

the university.”

But a junior coed laments, “It’s the 

only way” to manage work. Linda Lot, 

‘68, complains that in history “you 

don’t get an overview when you have 

to read ten paperbacks a semester,” 

without some outline to follow. One 

freshman honors student uses the notes 

exclusively in Great Books 192 and feels 

he is able to do at least as well, if not 

better than, the students who read the 

texts.

However, many courses are being 

structured to decrease the possibility of 

this occurring. Prof. L. McNamara of the 

English department “unconsciously” 

constructs his exams so that a student 

cannot get a good mark if he relies solely 

on study aids.

Prof. Marvin Felheim of the English 

department 
realizes 
students 
can 

manage to get a ‘C’ by reading study 

guides, but he is confident that, by the 

nature of his assignments, he outsmarts 

the notes. History 101 and 102 teaching 

fellow Ronald Huch said essay exams 

limited the advantages that a purely 

factual study outline could provide.

The reliability of factual material 

presented in study guides is also 

questioned. Since the notes are often 

written by grad students for small 

fees, the information is sometimes 

inadequate or inaccurate. Rather than 

see students use Study Masters or Cliff’s 

Notes, which he feels are inadequate, 

Hornabck recommends 15-cent Classics 

Illustrated comic books.

For a “quick, factual reference” for 

a student with a poor background in 

a subject, Huch often suggests use of 

Littlefield Notes, which he feels are 

written by “reputable scholars.” But 

Huch fears that about one-third of his 

class probably use notes in place of the 

text.

McNamara “pities” students who 

spend money on courses and then buy 

notes to “do their thinking for them.” 

Of study guides he states simply, “I wish 

there weren’t any.”

On the other hand, Asst. Prof. Walter 

CLark of the English department feels 

it is somewhat “comic” for a student to 

cheat himself by using a study guide 

independently of the text and pretend 

he is getting away with something.

“Uncertainty 
is 
what 
makes 
intellectual 
life 
exciting,” Lieberman wrote. 
“Unfortunately the tolerance 
that 
was 
on 
display 
on 
November 14 is part of the 
growing climate of intolerance 
that has led to the shutting 
down of speakers on college 
campuses across the country. 
Irony of ironies: while student 
representatives spoke in favor 
of silencing me, UMDivest 
supporters in the audience 
waved signs that read ‘Do Not 
Silence Me.’”
People 
have 
previously 
accused 
faculty 
members 
claiming 
academic 
freedom 
in their criticism of Israel 

of 
anti-Semitism. 
In 
2018, 
American Culture Professor 
John 
Cheney-Lippold 
and 
Graduate Student Instructor 
Lucy Peterson refused to write 
letters 
of 
recommendation 
for students studying abroad 
in Israel as part of a boycott 
against the alleged human 
rights 
abuses 
occurring 
in 
Palestine. 
The 
move 
garnered 
national attention, including 
accusations of anti-Semitism 
and multiple death threats 
against Cheney-Lippold. The 
University issued disciplinary 
action, 
withholding 
his 
sabbatical 
eligibility 
and 
credits until the Fall 2020 
semester. 
In an email to The Daily, 
Cheney-Lippold 
stressed 
the importance of viewing 
the order in its geopolitical 

context, 
citing 
the 
Trump 
administration’s relocation of 
the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem 
and recognition of the Golan 
Heights as a part of Israel. 
He also described the order 
as a push to silence pro-BDS 
conversations.
“Trump 
is 
using 
this 
re-definition of anti-Semitism, 
fairly explicitly, as a means 
to 
silence 
political 
speech 
that seeks to draw attention 
to human rights violations in 
Israel,” Cheney-Lippold wrote. 
“Critique of a state — indeed, 
any state — must be protected 
and not be seen as a critique of 
the people of that state.”
New 
definition 
elicits 
national response, criticism
The executive order sparked 
outcry 
from 
professors 
at 
higher education institutions 
across the country. The Jewish 

Studies 
Activist 
Network, 
an organization that speaks 
out 
against 
policies 
that 
run counter to its members’ 
values 
as 
Jewish 
studies 
scholars, issued a letter on 
Dec. 19 detailing the concerns 
surrounding Trump’s executive 
order. The letter explained the 
dangers of adopting a definition 
that includes all “targeting” of 
Israel as anti-Semitic. 
The executive order codifies 
the International Holocaust 
Remembrance 
Alliance’s 
definition 
of 
anti-Semitism, 
but JSAN’s letter points out 
that the lead author of the 
definition, 
Kenneth 
Stern, 
publicly 
declared 
that 
the 
government should not adopt 
it, as using such definitions as 
a matter of U.S. policy was not 
the original intention.

MICHAEL BAGAZINSKI/Daily
Gavriel D. Rosenfeld of Fairfield University discusses alternative timelines in Jewish history at the What Ifs of Jewish History lecture at 202 S Thayer Tuesday afternoon.


“I felt that two things 
couldn’t be true at the 
same time,” Zipursky said. 
“I wish I could tell myself 
that the joy I was feeling 
was real, and just because I 
was having fun didn’t mean 
I wasn’t taking what I had 
been through and my pain 
seriously … We are allowed 
to feel all of it and to feel 
fully alive, whatever that 
means for us.”
Zipursky 
said 
some 
survivors 
feel 
they 
are 
incapable 
of 
developing 
meaningful 
connections 
during the healing process, 
such as through friendship 
or a romantic partner. She 
said helping others is a 
community effort between 
survivors and allies. 
“Community is a source 
of resiliency and healing,” 
Zipursky said. 
Zipursky said healing is 
different for each survivor 
due to a variety of factors, 
including 
socioeconomic 
status, 
sexuality, 
race 
and 
gender. 
She 
said 
prescriptive advice can lead 
to a singular sexual assault 
narrative being accepted, 

and those who do not relate 
to that experience or set of 
identities can feel silenced.
“I am a cis white hetero 
woman from a great deal 
of financial and economic 
privilege, 
and 
I 
was 
harmed by a cis man,” 
Zipursky 
said. 
“That 
follows a specific narrative 
of survivorship. This is the 
narrative that gets told 
most. I have friends whose 
story doesn’t follow this 
same narrative and feel very 
invalidated … Especially 
when it comes to people 
who are survivors who are 
queer and/or trans. There 
is this thing that happens 
due 
to 
homophobia 
and transphobia in our 
country, 
especially 
for 
child sex abuse survivors, 
people 
will 
pathologize 
survivors.”
Zipurksy also explained 
how 
the 
#MeToo 
movement 
has 
impacted 
how survivors who are 
privately coping perceive 
their trauma.
“I see it a lot with 
sharing our stories and 
being a public survivor,” 
Zipursky said. “Especially 
in this moment in time, in 
this 
particular 
iteration 
of Tarana Burke’s MeToo 

movement, we see a lot 
of public survivors who 
are being exalted as being 
courageous and brave, and 
it is having an unintended 
effect of having survivors 
who feel that doesn’t feel 
that is part of their healing 
journey feel less brave.”
In an interview with The 
Daily after the event, LSA 
senior Nicole Ireland said 
she enjoyed the discussion 
about using sex as a method 
for reclaiming a sense of 
control over one’s body.
“I like to hear about how 
sex can be used in a positive 
way and to take back your 
bodily 
autonomy, 
just 
having that control over 
the choices you make and 
how that can be helpful for 
those who have felt their 
choice has been taken away 
in the past,” Ireland said. 
LSA senior Celine Roest 
said events such as these 
are 
crucial 
to 
creating 
a 
supportive 
campus 
environment.
“This is something that 
is so prevalent in the news 
and the media that we get,” 
Roest said. “Bringing in 
experts who can break it 
down for us and answer 
our specific questions is so 
helpful.”

In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick Fitzgerald confirmed on 
Tuesday that the president’s 
office had received the letter 
and that Schlissel would 
respond directly to Climate 
Blue once he had time to 
review it.
In 
the 
letter, 
Climate 
Blue asks the University to 
drop its charges against the 
arrested climate advocacy 

protestors who sought a 
meeting with Schlissel at 
the Fleming Administrative 
Building on March 15, 2019.
Rackham student Akash 
Shah, one of the co-directors 
of 
Climate 
Blue 
and 
a 
delegate at COP 25, said she 
does not feel the group’s 
requests are unreasonable.
“What we’re asking for 
is not unreasonable,” Shah 
said. 
“We’re 
asking 
for 
something that is important 
for 
us 
and 
for 
future 
generations. 
So, 
I 
think 
it’s wrong to punish us for 
making these demands. And 
I think that the University 

should continue to provide 
a platform where we can 
express our views.” 
According 
to 
Rackham 
student Juan Jhong Chung, 
who 
participated 
in 
the 
protests at COP 25, the 
movement was a peaceful 
demonstration 
led 
by 
activists who felt their voices 
were 
excluded, 
despite 
climate change having a 
disproportionate impact on 
them. Jhong Chung claimed 
the U.N. called security and 
the Spanish police to remove 
them from the conference 
as they were protesting how 
large oil companies had a 

voice in the negotiations.
“It was really frustrating 
to see politicians bend over 
backwards to appease big 
polluters 
like 
Chevron, 
Exxon and BP and make 
them 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
solution to climate change 
when these companies have 
not even acknowledged that 
they are the main culprits 
of these problems,” Jhong 
Chung said.
Rackham student Alexa 
White said this was her third 
time attending the COP. She 
said the idea to write the 
letter to the administration 
came 
about 
during 
the 

second week of COP 25 when 
the member countries were 
struggling to make progress 
in the negotiations. 
“Week-two delegates were 
very interested in what we 
could do on a larger scale,” 
White said. “So, most of 
the stakeholders and the 
things that we were doing 
were … not as impactful for 
the administration of the 
University … we just thought 
we want U-M to respond with 
urgency as it was presented 
at the convention.”
Jhong Chung said while 
the 13 delegates collectively 
wrote the letter, he said he 

worked to include specific 
recommendations 
for 
the 
University to divest from all 
fossil fuel investments and 
to center carbon neutrality 
efforts around social justice.
“The connection between 
indigenous 
people 
and 
climate change is highly 
interrelated,” Jhong Chung 
said. “The fact that we have 
taken their land, the fact 
that so many construction 
projects of fossil fuels or 
other 
natural 
resources 
are in indigenous people’s 
lands are part of why we are 
currently in this crisis.”

Bill 
McAllister, 
general 
manager 
of 
transportation 
at the University, noted they 
also chose to partner with 
Clever 
Devices 
because 
many area transit agencies in 
southeastern Michigan use the 
same technology.
“It gives us a lot of synergy 
with these other organizations 
so we can pool our resources 
together to troubleshoot items, 
and also be competitive when 
we ask for new features and 
things that we want to see from 
Clever Devices,” McAllister 
said. “We are much stronger 
stakeholders being together 
like that.”
Michael 
Berg, 
a 
Music, 
Theatre & Dance and LSA 
junior, said he uses the bus 
almost every day, and the 
change to U-M Magic Bus has 
made planning trips to and 
from North Campus easier.
“Overall, the new bus app is 
an improvement,” Berg said. 
“A greater proportion of blue 
buses overall are displayed in 
the new app versus the old one, 
which makes a big difference, 
because you can’t plan for 
new buses that you can’t see. 
Also, the estimated arrival 
times in the new systems are 
much more accurate than in 
DoubleMap.”
According to Transportation 
Senior 
Supervisor 
Michael 
Denemy, 
the 
increased 
visibility of buses on the map 

is the result of drivers logging 
into the Magic Bus system for 
their shifts.
“In 
the 
current 
system, 
it’s a several-year-old tablet 
on 
a 
vehicle 
that 
doesn’t 
necessarily 
update 
in 
real 
time,” Denemy said. “So, if it’s 
not communicating correctly 
to the server, then your vehicle 
isn’t going to correctly pop up 
on the map. In the new system, 
it’s 
all 
handled 
internally, 
so we shouldn’t see many 
instances of that anymore.”
Denemy said the Magic Bus 
system utilizes a prediction 
algorithm that considers the 
route, schedule database and 
real-time 
vehicle 
location 
data, 
helping 
increase 
the 
app’s accuracy.
“In the past, DoubleMap 
did not consider the schedule 
information or the historical 
data,” Denemy said. “Now it’s 
tied in there. It knows what 
the trips are, it knows what 
bus is performing that trip, so 
it can better predict where the 
vehicle is going to be, where 
the vehicle is intending to be. 
It also stores that information 
over the past 30 days or so. It’s 
a weighted average to make 
that even more accurate than 
it currently is, because it will 
take in real traffic patterns 
over the course of a month.”
Despite the perks, Berg still 
thinks the app has much to 
improve.
“The new app is still a bit 
clunky,” Berg said. “It doesn’t 
open directly to the live map, 
which I think for students, 

that’s the feature they use most. 
It’s not terribly responsive, 
and the bus positions don’t 
update 
terribly 
frequently, 
which makes it hard to tell if 
you’re viewing buses live or 
viewing buses that were there 
when you closed it hours ago.”
LSA 
freshman 
Rachel 
Himmel 
downloaded 
the 
app so she could familiarize 
herself with it before the 
official transition.
“I’ve 
definitely 
noticed 
some 
problems 
with 
it,” 
Himmel said. “Sometimes, I’ll 
check it whenever (the bus is) 
12 minutes out. When I check 
it again five minutes later, and 
whenever I try to do it and 
load the exact same thing I had 
previously done, it will tell me 
that there’s an error and that 
they’re experiencing technical 
difficulties right now.”
Babut said when the U-M 
Magic 
Bus 
app 
was 
first 
released, many of the users’ 
difficulties were caused by 
planned system outages. Babut 
said he values the community 
input on the app.
“We do welcome feedback 
and acknowledge that all apps 
are different, and we continue 
to listen to feedback,” Babut 
said. “It seems like the most 
consistent 
feedback 
we’re 
hearing is improving the rate 
that the bus refreshes on the 
app to provide a more fluid 
experience. We’ve heard that, 
and we’ve recognized that 
feedback, and we’re working 
with the supplier to improve 
that frequency.”

JSAN 
encouraged 
scholars and educators from 
colleges 
and 
universities 
across the world to sign 
the letter in support of 
condemning 
Trump’s 
executive order. More than 
100 names are attached to 
the letter, including faculty 
and staff at the University 
such as Veidlinger, Karla 
Goldman, 
Sam 
Shuman, 
Anita Norich, Rachel Rafael 
Neis and Shachar Pinsker.
Lila 
Corwin 
Berman, 
Temple University history 
professor and member of 
the 
JSAN 
coordinating 
committee, 
said 
the 
order specifically targets 
students who have origins 
tied to Israel, including 
Palestinian 
and 
Muslim 
students. Berman discussed 
the necessity of learning 
about 
the 
histories 
and 
the 
conflicts 
related 
to 
Israel, which she said will 
be hindered as the order is 
implemented in college and 
university campuses.
“Suddenly, 
there 
are 
people who feel like they 
don’t want to touch it, they 
don’t want to get involved,” 
Berman said. “You have 
this area of study that is 
incredibly 
important 
to 
think 
about 
historically, 
to think about politically, 
economically, in all these 
lenses that academia can 
bring, that people are going 
to feel like they can’t talk 
about it or they will face 
consequences. 
And 
that 
some people, by virtue of 
their identity, be seen as 
suspects already for this.”
National Jewish affinity 
groups 
have 
differed 
in 
their response to the order. 
While 
critics 
question 
if Trump is using it as a 
political tool to lure in 
Jewish support, prominent 
organizations such as the 
Anti-Defamation 
League 
and 
American 
Jewish 
Committee have released 
statements supporting the 
order.
The AJC noted it will 
continue 
to 
speak 
out 
against 
any 
“rational 
criticism” of Israel, though 
it does not see this order 
as an attempt to stifle free 
speech.
“We trust that a careful 
application of this directive 
will 
enable 
university 
administrators 
to 
avoid 
running afoul of free speech 
protections as they seek to 
root out anti-Semitism on 
their campuses,” AJC CEO 
David Harris wrote in a 
statement.
Students, faculty split 
on potential impacts of 
order
In addition to noting his 
department will not make 
any 
changes 
because 
of 
the order, Veidlinger said 
the order has no practical 
purpose, besides signaling 
to 
academia 
that 
they 
are being watched by the 
government.
“I think they recognize 
that universities promote 
liberal values of tolerance, 
diversity 
— 
and 
those 
values are an anathema to 
the current government,” 
Veidliner said.
LSA 
sophomore 
David 
Zwick, 
president 
of 
Wolverines 
for 
Israel, 
acknowledged 
that 
academic 
overreach 
by 
the federal government is 
a prominent concern but 
said anti-Semitism was a 
problem that many Jewish 
students face. 

“Students 
feel 
frankly 
scared 
to 
walk 
around 
wearing symbols of Judaism 
publicly, like a yamaka or a 
Star of David, on some of the 
most diverse campuses that 
we have, not only diverse but 
one of the most prestigious 
college campuses in this 
country,” Zwick said.
Goldman, 
a 
professor 
of 
Judaic 
studies 
and 
program director of Jewish 
Communal Leadership who 
signed the JSAN letter, said 
the executive order may feel 
unsettling for many in the 
Jewish community because 
she believes singling out 
Jewish people may lead to 
increased anti-Semitism.
“We discussed this in 
class, 
this 
blurriness 
of 
what Jewish identity is in 
general,” 
Goldman 
said. 
“It’s not just a religion, it’s 
not just a culture, it’s not 
just a peoplehood. But these 
things, like nationality or 
race, are just very clumsy 
fits, as well as religion. 
Those 
are 
categories 
that our culture gives us 
that aren’t great fits for 
describing an identity that 
has lots of facets and means 
different things to different 
people.” 
After the executive order 
was signed, students and 
activist groups on campus 
alternatively praised and 
criticized the move. 
Social 
Work 
student 
Simeon Adler is currently in 
the first year of the Jewish 
Communal 
Leadership 
Program. 
Adler 
said 
Trump’s 
decision 
may 
further 
alienate 
Jewish 
students. 
“It singles out the Jews 
themselves, which I think a 
lot of Jews on campus and in 
general are really skeptical 
about, and a little cautious 
about,” Adler said. “This 
whole idea of labeling us as 
a nationality has people a 
little uneasy.”
Students 
also 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
order will influence the 
academic freedom of faculty 
teaching about Israel.
LSA 
senior 
Silan 
Fadlallah, who took The 
Arab-Israeli 
Conflict 
in 
Middle Eastern Literature 
and Film, noted that the 
executive 
order 
could 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
discussions 
in 
the 
classroom, specifically for 
Palestinian students.
“Some 
Palestinian 
students, specifically, may 
feel a little less encouraged 
to be able to participate in 
these types of discussions 
for 
fear 
of 
being 
anti-
Semitic,” 
Fadlallah 
said. 
“Personally, 
I 
have 
no 
problem 
speaking 
out 
about it and standing up for 
myself, but I know a lot of 
students would take a step 
back because of that.”
Deborah 
Dash 
Moore, 
Frederick 
G.L. 
Huetwell 
professor 
of 
history, 
currently teaches several 
courses related to Jewish 
history and culture. Moore 
said she will focus her 
classes more on the history 
and methods of combating 
anti-Semitism. 
“That approach I will 
probably pay a little more 
attention to because those 
are efforts to dismantle 
the practice of anti-Semitic 
discrimination by explicitly 
calling 
upon 
American 
ideals, 
rather 
than 
grounding it in definitions 
of what constitutes as anti-
Semitism,” Moore said. 
Moore’s classes examine 
the 
history 
of 
Zionism, 
which 
Israel’s 
Ministry 

of Foreign Affairs defines 
as 
“an 
ideology 
which 
expresses the yearning of 
Jews the world over for 
their historical homeland — 
Zion, the Land of Israel.” 
Similar 
to 
Cheney-
Lippold, Fadlallah raised 
concerns that anti-Zionism 
could be considered anti-
Semitism when they are not 
the same. 
“Just because you are 
against the state of Israel, 
that does not mean you are 
against 
Jewish 
people,” 
Fadlallah said. 
According 
to 
Zwick, 
there are two main types 
of discussion surrounding 
Israel. The first is fair, 
just 
criticism 
of 
Israel 
similar to how any person 
could 
criticize 
the 
U.S. 
However, in Zwick’s eyes, 
the second type — criticism 
that 
disproportionately 
scrutinizes 
Israel 
— 
is 
unhealthy. 
Zwick 
thinks 
that pro-Palestinian groups 
are sometimes unable to 
distinguish between those 
discussions.
“Their 
claim 
that 
is 
that their free speech is 
being stifled, specifically 
disproportionately 
being 
stifled, I think that’s also 
ridiculous,” 
Zwick 
said. 
“The reason I say that is 
because what they accuse 
us of doing is conflating 
criticism 
of 
Israel 
and 
anti-Semitism, but really, 
it’s really they who are 
conflating it.” 
Education junior Diana 
Yassin has taken History 
244: The History of the 
Arab-Israeli Conflict and 
Political Science 353: The 
Arab-Israeli Conflict. She 
said the courses were taught 
with a pro-Israeli focus.
“I really don’t agree with 
the ways these classes are 
taught often just because 
I feel like it really neglects 
a lot of the Palestinian 
perspective 
and 
really 
puts a lot of blame on 
Palestinians,” Yassin said. 
Zwick, however, said he 
has not witnessed any bias 
in 
the 
Middle 
Eastern-
focused 
classes 
that 
he 
has taken. He noted anti-
Semitic 
teachings 
might 
not always happen in the 
topics strictly pertaining to 
Middle Eastern or Judaic 
studies. 
“A lot of the issues of 
anti-Semitism come from 
classes that are completely 
irrelevant 
to 
this 
topic, 
oftentimes in departments 
that 
you 
wouldn’t 
even 
imagine this would come 
up,” Zwick said. “Go and ask 
so many pro-Israel students 
on this campus … they will 
be painfully familiar with 
instances on this campus 
and/or on other campuses 
of 
teachers 
using 
the 
classroom as a platform 
to 
promote 
anti-Semitic 
movements against Israel.”
Goldman 
said 
universities 
should 
be 
places 
for 
encouraging 
conversations 
and 
broadening 
perspectives, 
and this order undermines 
that goal. Because of this, 
Goldman 
said 
she 
sees 
the order as a threat to 
academic freedom.
“Most of us are here 
because we want to have 
access to voice, to financial 
security — these things 
that a university can help 
provide — to legitimacy,” 
Goldman said. “Our hopes 
— our ideals — are that it’s a 
place for opening discourse, 
rather 
than 
shutting 
it 
down. And that’s why this 
(executive order) feels bad.”

Rosenfeld discussed his 
predictions of what would 
happen 
moving 
forward 
from 
Hitler’s 
theoretical 
assassination. 
“And over the next few 
years, I argue two million 
Jews are going to be shipped 
to Palestine, largely thanks 
to the efforts of French 
German and Romania is the 
Navy’s of French France, 
Germany 
and 
Romania,” 
Rosenfeld said. 
After 
Rosenfeld 
spoke, 
University professors Devi 
Mays and Jeffrey Veidlinger 
began 
a 
discussion 
that 

focused largely on the duty 
of historians to follow in 
Rosenfeld’s 
footsteps 
and 
consider 
alternatives 
to 
certain histories. 
“I was very convinced by 
the case you made in the 
introduction to your book,” 
Mays 
said 
to 
Rosenfeld. 
“There is something very 
valuable 
for 
historians 
in 
doing 
counterfactual 
history. There are multiple 
things that are valuable.” 
When Ann Arbor resident 
Ted Beimoel heard about 
this seminar, he said he 
was interested in learning 
more about the “what ifs” of 
Jewish history and decided 
to attend.
“This 
seemed 
like 
an 
interesting 
alternative 

history,” 
Beimoel 
said. 
“Other than that, I don’t 
really know a lot about this 
topic.”
LSA senior Maya Tinoco is 
a Judaic studies minor and 
is taking the class “Jews in 
the Modern World: Texts, 
Images, Ideas.” Tinoco said 
the students in this class 
were encouraged to attend 
the event to learn more 
about Jewish history and 
what it could have been.
“I 
thought 
this 
topic 
would be really interesting,” 
Tinoco said. “‘What if’ is 
a really big topic in life in 
general, specifically, in this 
sort of history. It’s very 
interesting, like ‘what ifs’ 
could change a lot of the 
trajectory of history.”

T

he sun has captivated 
our 
hearts 
and 
imaginations 
for 
millennia. Every organism on 
Earth is powered by the sun. 
Even our energy sources — coal, 
natural gas, wind, hydroelectric 
— 
are 
indirectly 
generated 
through solar power. But what 
really excites me is solar power 
itself. Humans have used solar-
thermal power to make fire or 
heat or pump water since the 
7th century B.C. We figured out 
how to convert solar energy 
directly into electricity in 1839, 
with the first photovoltaic cell. 
These three technologies have 
evolved and entered the market 
at wildly different paces and 
success rates. 
Ancient 
hot-water 
solar 
panels evolved into rooftop 
hot-water 
solar 
panels, 
famously 
installed 
on 
the 
White House by President 
Jimmy Carter in 1979, and also 
into concentrated solar power 
panels (CSPs), first developed 
in 1968 by Professor Giovanni 
Francia. CSPs use sophisticated 
mirrors to concentrate sunlight 
to heat liquids to extreme 
temperatures. 
Through 
additional 
processes, 
these 
hot liquids can be converted to 
electricity or stored for future 
use. Unlike CSPs, photovoltaics 
(PVs) convert solar energy 
directly into electricity. The 
most common type of PV is 
crystalline 
silicon, 
which 
dominates 90 percent of the 
solar cell industry. However, 
PVs raise the problem of 
intermittence — the amount 
of available sunlight varies 
with time of day and weather 
conditions. This means that 
PVs cannot meet electricity 
demand in real-time without 

battery 
storage. 
Battery 
chemistry further complicates 
this 
process, 
introducing 
additional barriers of costs, 
production 
and 
waste. 
It 
is for this reason that the 
photoelectrochemical 
cell 
(PEC) model is particularly 
exciting. PECs convert solar 
power directly into chemical 
fuels. The most common type 
of PEC cell is a hydrogen fuel 
cell, which converts water 
into 
hydrogen 
fuel. 
This 
hydrogen fuel can be stored 
and transported until needed 
to generate electricity. This 
process works by employing a 
hydrogen fuel cell: Hydrogen 
fuel passes through a platinum 
catalyst 
and 
mixes 
with 
oxygen to produce electricity 
and water. In this process, 
new 
complications 
emerge 
concerning the cost of catalysts 
and the design of safe, reliable 
fuel cells. Regardless, the PEC 
model eliminates the need for 
battery storage and overcomes 
the intermittence of PVs.
Despite 
these 
exciting 
technologies, solar energy only 
makes up 1.5 percent of energy 
production 
in 
the 
United 
States. One of the biggest 
challenges has been the cost 
(which is measured in cents 
per kilowatt hour), with fossil 
fuels clocking in around five 
cents per kWh. However, solar 
energy is starting to compete 
with fossil fuels. Utility-owned 
silicon PVs have dropped in 
cost from 23 cents per kWh in 
2010 to an average of six cents 
per kWh in 2017. The cost of 
utility-owned solar panels will 
typically remain lower than 
the decentralized alternatives 
— solar panels on residential 
or 
commercial 
buildings. 

However, 
an 
attractive 
alternative is a power purchase 
agreement (PPA), where a 
utility 
company 
purchases 
electricity from a third party 
that owns the solar panels. 
The cost of solar PPA has also 
dropped significantly over the 
years, to less than three cents 
per kWh in 2018 with some 
geographical variance. Every 
state has a unique energy 
profile, 
though 
none 
are 
dominated by solar power.
Of course, all is not lost. 
Solar research has promoted 
rapid growth of solar capacity: 
The U.S. saw a 16 percent 
increase 
in 
installed 
PV 
capacity in 2018 to 626,000 
megawatts. 
Globally, 
we’re 
projected to achieve a terawatt 
(or one million megawatts) of 
PV capacity by 2023. CSPs in 
the U.S. reached an installed 
capacity of 1,815 megawatts in 
2018. PECs are not quite ready 
for commercialization due to 
strict material demands and 
limitations in hydrogen fuel 
cell technology. CSP, PV and 
PEC solar cells demonstrate 
benefits 
and 
limitations 
concerning 
energy 
storage, 
material 
input 
and 
waste 
production. 
The 
market 
disproportionately 
favors 
silicon PV solar cells which 
does not accurately represent 
the wealth of knowledge and 
advancement in the solar cell 
field. Our ability to capture 
solar power is a marvel; it’s 
what makes us human. And 
we’re 
not 
slowing 
down 
anytime soon.

Dismantling hidden sexism in contemporary media
I

n Sarah Boxer’s “Why Are All 
the Cartoon Mothers Dead?”, 
she highlights the injustice 
done to mothers in children’s 
animated films. Boxer’s analysis of 
cartoons, ranging from “Ice Age” 
to the Mickey Mouse universe, 
exposes 
the 
systematic 
social 
suppression of women and hidden 
misogyny found within seemingly 
innocent cartoons. Boxer is a 
cultural critic and writer, and her 
article has shaped the way I view all 
forms of media today. Her detailed 
unpacking 
of 
characters 
and 
plotlines in animated films inspired 
me to begin questioning women’s 
ultimate purpose in different types 
of media and helped me notice the 
oppressive and often sexualized 
way women are depicted in popular 
culture. 
Growing up in a traditional 
household, the depiction of women 
by those around me was heavily 
influenced by the old-fashioned 
mannerisms of a typical Sicilian 
family. My father’s parents came 
to the United States as immigrants 
from Sicily, and therefore had a 
strict view on the role of a woman. 
None of my aunts on my father’s 
side attended college or had much 
freedom when deciding what 
to do with their life. This wasn’t 
necessarily a bad thing, as they all 
were content with getting married 
in their early twenties and taking 
up the tasking job of being a stay-at-
home mother. From a young age, I 
remember constantly questioning 
why I was always the one asked to 
clean the kitchen or vacuum the 
house, while my brother was never 
bothered with such requests. I 
quickly realized the inequality I 
faced within my own home, even 
with something as simple as chores. 
This disparity both upset and 
interested me. What was the origin 
of these inherent stereotypes, 
and was women’s oppression in 
media an effect or cause of the 
continuation of this sexist nature?
According to feminist theorists, 
Western thought has been built 
upon the systematic and social 
repression of women. The attention 
on the portrayal of women in 
advertisements stems from the rise 
of feminist movements and the 
changing roles and perceptions of 
women in society. Specifically, the 
women’s movements in the 1960s 
propelled this conversation, with 
calls for equal opportunity and 
representation for women in society 
– touching on politics, sexuality, 
work and domestic life. Despite 
the social advancement evident in 
women from this time frame, the 
mainstream media lagged behind, 
continuing 
a 
hypersexualized 

and misogynistic presentation of 
women. However, there currently 
seems to be a shift from the old 
female representation paradigm in 
advertisements toward a new one. 
This shift is even being enforced in 
countries like the United Kingdom, 
which recently passed a legal ban 
on “harmful” gender stereotypes in 
advertisements.
I 
often 
question 
whether 
advertisers have a responsibility 
to consider gender norms and 
the potential harm they inflict on 
women. Typically, the “standard” 
or “old” paradigm of advertising 
promoted the representation of 
women as submissive, weak or 
in a constant state of requiring 
modification. 
This 
perception 
of 
women 
has 
influenced 
advertisements since the 1950s, 
even in those that seemed to be 
“liberating.” 
The 
shift 
toward 

a new paradigm, as discussed 
by attorney John Alan Cohan, 
is 
one 
that 
redefines 
female 
beauty to be natural, diverse 
and all-encompassing instead of 
unattainable. 
While 
advertising 
itself is not ethically wrong or right, 
the context in which it is used 
can often be harmful through the 
promotion of negative gender and 
racial stereotypes. 
The 
shift 
toward 
a 
new 
standard of advertising reveals 
itself through historically sexist 
brands, like Axe, changing their 
marketing techniques in order to 
reflect societal change. The brand 
Axe notoriously released sexist 
advertisements for around 15 years, 
perpetuating gender stereotypes 
for both men and women. The main 
plot in each of these advertisements 
emphasized the Axe Effect, which 
is the idea that girls will flock to 
guys who use Axe. The structure 
of these advertisement featured 
the characterization of women 
as prominent sex objects and 
promoted unrealistic expectations 
for men. However, Axe’s “Find Your 
Magic” campaign, “Is It Ok For 
Guys?” campaign and the recent 
“Bathsculinity” campaign exhibit 
a new approach to advertising that 

discards its stereotypical storyline 
and characterization of genders. 
Now, sex is not the focus of the 
ad and individuality is praised. 
These reject “must-have, must-be” 
fashion norms or body standards 
and embrace unique and distinct 
traits that make up individuals. 
With the rise of social media, the 
questioning of and rebellion against 
societal and gender norms has 
become a major point in feminist 
movements. Body positivity and 
acceptance of all different types of 
people is an important trend and 
marketing strategy for not only Axe, 
but companies ranging from Dove 
to Gillette to Audi. Advertisements 
have a unique position in which 
they can be viewed as a cultural lens, 
revealing what producers perceive 
to be important to the culture at 
that time, because they believe it 
will result in increased sales for 
their company. While companies 
like Axe show the progression of 
society and a shift toward a new 
standard of advertising, there are 
still polarizing reactions to these 
advertisements. This was seen 
in responses to the 2019 Gillette 
“We Believe: The Best Men Can 
Be” commercial which discussed 
holding 
men 
accountable 
for 
issues such as bullying and sexual 
assault. While this advertisement 
is a cultural lens into the ongoing 
conversation 
regarding 
sexual 
misconduct and movements such 
as #MeToo, it is also a means for 
cultural progression. On Twitter, 
Piers Morgan responded “I’ve 
used @Gillette razors my entire 
adult life but this absurd virtue-
signaling PC guff may drive me 
away to a company less eager to 
fuel the current pathetic global 
assault on masculinity. Let boys be 
damn boys. Let men be damn men.” 
While many supported the positive 
message Gillette was sending, 
negative reactions like Morgan’s 
reveal the remaining hold on male 
privilege and stereotypical gender 
norms for many. 
When viewing Axe’s shift in 
marketing strategy, advertisers may 
find it more appropriate with our 
social climate to shift toward more 
inclusive marketing techniques. 
While this change is often slow, the 
number of recent advertisements 
that portray positive and non-
binding gender norms are growing, 
pushing advertisers that previously 
disregarded the effects of gender 
norms toward a socially acceptable, 
marketable and healthy way of 
advertising that we should all strive 
to support.

S

uper Bowl ads. People 
love them, and they’re a 
huge spectacle. I know a 
couple people who solely tune 
in for the ads, not caring for the 
game but fascinated with the 
corporate creativity on display. 
I’ll admit, I’m not a huge fan of 
sporting events, but all the buzz 
surrounding the Super Bowl 
makes it nearly impossible to stay 
uninformed. I was unamused by 
most of the commercials, but one 
in particular really ticked me 
off. The commercial in question? 
The Planters commercial, where 
they revealed their new mascot, 
“Baby Nut,” after their longtime 
mascot Mr. Peanut supposedly 
died. Killing off Mr. Peanut 
was a shameless move that 
embodies everything insidious 
and pathetic about corporate 
marketing. Planter’s first post 
on Instagram about the new 
mascot was literally a plug for 
merchandise, hinting at their 
intentions of monetizing before 
the day was over. 
The move by Planters was 
obviously inspired by all of the 
theatrics 
surrounding 
Baby 
Yoda, the 50-year-old infant from 
Disney’s 
“The 
Mandalorian.” 
Baby Yoda is suspiciously similar 
to a character in Disney’s other 
purchased franchise, Marvel’s 
Baby Groot. The Verge wrote an 
article summing up the various 
trends this decade that have been 
related to babies, showing the 
infantilization fever. Executives 
at Planters wanted to cash in 
on that trend, and they have no 
qualms letting the world know. 
It’s uninspired and insulting that 
they think people are going to 
tolerate this drivel. But contrary 
to my assumptions, the Internet 
ate it up with a surprising fervor.
Some of the Super Bowl ads 
are avant-garde and break the 
mold, but others just play upon 
empathy to get you thinking 

about 
their 
product. 
An 
example of this would be this 
year’s Budweiser commercial. 
The 
commercial 
plays 
on 
the 
stereotypical 
“typical 
American,” showing scenes of 
heroism 
and 
heartwarming 
reunions. A deployed soldier 
reuniting with his father. A 
firefighter putting out a fire in 
California. Sure, none of those 
images are inherently bad. But 
what do they have to do with 
Budweiser? They call themselves 
a “typical American” beer, as if 
those exceptional moments are 
uniquely tied to Budweiser’s 
product. It doesn’t change the 
low quality of the product they 
sell. Just like Baby Nut, it’s 
shameless and manipulative.
One commercial that’s even 
more insulting is Walmart’s, 
which 
attempts 
to 
evoke 
empathy. 
“We 
see 
united 
towns,” 
they 
say. 
They’re 
a champion for small town 
America, and they love all the 
communities there. Walmart 
loves you! Except they don’t. 
It’s widely known that Walmart 
destroys 
local 
businesses, 
taking jobs down with them and 
causing even more destruction 
if they ever decide to leave. Such 
was the case for Edna, Texas. 
After a Walmart opened up in 
1982, they replaced the need for 
local retailers and pharmacists. 
Out of nowhere, just last year, 
the store closed. It left people 
scrambling for places to get 
the goods needed. This isn’t an 
isolated case, either. In 2018, 
Walmart closed 63 stores after 
they 
raised 
wages, 
leaving 
workers jobless. Many of their 
employees have a wage below 
the poverty line, which adds 
insult to injury. If anything, 
Walmart is an enemy of small 
towns and their livelihoods. 
The commercial is downright 
malicious in the way it tries to 

convince the American populace 
that they are anything but 
corporate hegemony. 
All of this is adjacent to how 
brands work on Twitter. Have 
you ever seen those tweets by a 
verified company that try to use 
a meme to get you to buy their 
product? Their tweets always 
make sure to be humorous, but 
tepid enough not to tarnish 
their brand name. The genesis 
of this trend seems to be the 
Wendy’s 
Twitter 
account, 
which 
in 
2017 
caught 
the 
social media network by storm 
when they began “roasting” 
people, insulting not only their 
competitors but individuals who 
dared question their hegemony. 
Plenty of compilations have been 
made about their “epic roasts,” 
essentially giving the company 
loads 
of 
free 
advertising. 
Personally, a corporation with 
such power and influence – more 
than I’ll ever realistically have 
in my life – punching down your 
average Twitter user rubs me the 
wrong way. Wendy’s has bigger 
problems to worry about, such as 
their violation of child labor laws.
This isn’t an issue many care 
about, but for me it’s hard to be 
complacent with the infiltration 
of focus-tested banal garbage 
that litters social media feeds. It’s 
downright insulting and I can’t 
even begin to imagine how many 
underpaid interns have been 
assigned to spitting the repugnant 
drivel that comes out of these 
accounts. Corporations are not 
people, and they’re certainly not 
a buddy you exchange relatable 
tweets with. They want your 
patronage, and will coax you into 
a Pavlovian relationship that 
can’t be reversed. Corporations 
are not your friend, and they 
never will be.

DESISLAVA DIKOVA | OP-ED

I

’ve never been to Missouri, 
but I’ve enjoyed many things 
from the state like Kansas City 
barbecue and the river. 
I assume Missouri, like 
the rest of the country, 
is filled with reasonably 
intelligent people. This 
is why I was flummoxed 
to learn that the state 
government in Missouri 
is regulating the use of 
the word “meat.” The 
legislation 
makes 
it 
illegal to call a product 
meat 
unless 
it 
was 
“derived from harvested 
production livestock or poultry.” 
Punishments for breaking the law 
will include a fine of up to $1,000 
and can bring a jail sentence of up to 
one year.
Proponents of the legislation 
claim using the term “meat” in 
reference to a product that does not 
come from an animal will confuse 
customers. But this is absurd 
— 
when a consumer buys plant-based 
meat that is labeled as such, it doesn’t 
strike me as particularly outlandish 
to assume they know what they are 
buying. Indeed, the company that 
produces Tofurky brought a lawsuit 
to this effect and litigation was still 
ongoing as of October 2019. Tofurky 
argued against it primarily on First 
Amendment grounds, but also that 
it didn’t mislead consumers. Both 
of these are justified points. Meat is 
more than what comes from poultry 
— as the complaint says, meat has 
been used to refer to the flesh in fruit 
and nuts. In addition, if someone 
buys something labeled “plant-
based meat” and are surprised by 

the lack of dead animal flesh, no 
legislation can help them. At that 
point, neither can God. 
Missouri is not 
alone in this kind 
of 
bad 
behavior 
with meat labeling. 
Arkansas passed a 
version of this bill 
that 
restricts 
the 
use of terms like 
“burger” and “pork” 
and 
others 
that 
have “been used or 
defined historically in 
reference to a specific 
agricultural product.” 
Thankfully, this bill was stopped 
by a federal judge who decided to 
grant a preliminary injunction. 
Again, it was Tofurky who sued, 
and although it worked out, costly 
litigation is not the answer to this 
kind of behavior.
Part of the problem is that this 
practice is not limited to the state 
level and is also not isolated to meat. 
During his time in office, then-
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, 
M.D., 
pushed 
to 
“modernize” 
dairy standards. This included a 
call to standardize definitions of 
words like milk. One such reason 
for this was things like almond 
milk. Government workers were 
worried about people being misled 
that almond milk was akin to milk 
from a cow. This was such a worry 
that Dr. Gottlieb went so far as to 
clarify that “an almond doesn’t 
lactate.” The good doctor was 
absolutely correct — almonds don’t 
lactate. However, this seems like a 
weird way to delineate what is and 
what isn’t milk. Coconut milk, for 

example, is made by grating coconut 
— a practice which goes back 
hundreds of years. Because lactation 
isn’t involved, does this mean it’s not 
milk? Of course not. 
These policies are all written in the 
language of protecting consumers, 
but it’s worth remembering former 
President Ronald Reagan’s famous 
maxim: “The most terrifying words 
in the English language are: I’m 
from the government and I’m here 
to help.” None of these policies are 
actually about protection, because 
this isn’t something people need 
protection from. If you can be 
trusted to put your pants on in the 
morning without adult supervision, 
you don’t need the state or federal 
government telling you what you can 
and cannot call meat or milk. People 
and firms should not be allowed to 
request the government to attempt 
cheap protectionist scams for the 
sake of the cattle industry. That is 
exactly what these bills are doing 
and why they are being backed by 
big agriculture lobbying at every 
turn. Exactly like in this case, where 
the Missouri bill was backed by the 
Missouri Cattlemen’s Association.
The American public isn’t a 
bunch of morons. They don’t need 
their government to protect them 
from almond milk and tofu burgers. 
They do need their government to 
protect them from predatory firms 
and industry attempting to capture 
the entire regulatory structure. 
Unfortunately, if past policymaking 
is any indication, they won’t get 
that.

Hayley Williams’ Petals for Armor I EP 
is great. If the name is recognizable, some 
might recall Williams’ time as lead singer 
for pop-punk band Paramore. Her debut 
EP is short and sweet, five tracks in all. But 
Petals for Armor I isn’t simply Paramore’s 
punk-angst refashioned for a new decade. 
Williams’ EP combines the signature high-
energy of her trademark songs (think “Still 
into You”) with a dash of weird and a heap 
of fun. 
My time spent listening to Paramore 
was largely defined by the characteristic 
angst of puberty, middle school insecurity 
and chihuahua-style yapping frustrations 
with the world. You know, that pre-teen 
phase spent staring emotionally out the car 
window, pretending to be in a Kelly Clarkson 
music video. Petals for Armor I manages to 
salvage something worthwhile from the 
aforementioned cringe-fest: the satisfaction 
of calling out the world, and revelling a bit in 
our anger. I’m not saying that Paramore isn’t 
cool –– but I know that my own previous 
Paramore-days were decidedly not cool. 
Take the gut-punch opening lines of 
“Leave It Alone”: “Don’t nobody tell me that 
God don’t have a sense of humor / Cause 
now that I want to live, well, everybody 
around me is dyin.” The biting, morbid 
humor recalls that absolutely delicious “take 
that!” of Paramore’s hit “Misery Business” or 
“Brick by Boring Brick.” But “Leave It Alone” 
is quiet. The “umph” of the lyrics doesn’t 
come from the blasting of drums or scream 
of the electric guitar, as with Paramore. 
Rather, Williams’ punch is as sobering as it 
is satisfying. The softly whispered confession 
finds catharsis in that fact that somebody 
finally said it –– no offense, God. 
Williams’ EP, however, isn’t just good 
because it strikes parallels to her classic hits 
with Paramore. In fact, Petals for Armor I is 
good because of how different it is. Williams 
has managed to fashion together sounds, 
feelings and styles in a Frankenstein manner 
that feels more alive than anything that came 
before it (or after). 
Take, for instance, “Creepin,’” a song 
destined to become 2020’s “Monster-Mash.” 
You know all the “Sexy Vampires” will be 
sing-shouting this song at the clubs come 
October 31st. The song is undeniably a bit 
weird, but refreshing. Williams’ imaginative, 
spooky lyrics and her deep drawl strikes a 
vague echo of Marina and the Diamonds 
(think “Primadonna”). Beneath her haunting 
lullaby Williams alludes to the parasites of 

our lives that feast on our misery, “Oh just 
keep suckin’ on the memory of him.” 
“Cinnamon,” strangely enough, can’t help 
but feel reminiscent of Frozen 2’s “Into the 
Unknown.” Don’t worry, they’re nothing 
alike –– except for William’s haunting siren 
call that acts as a wordless chorus. For those 
that haven’t seen Disney’s latest animated 
release, Princess Elsa has a mind-blowingly 
awesome duet with an ominous siren call 
of her own. The song narrowly balances 
between 
comforting 
and 
warm 
(like 
cinnamon) and a tinge hair-raising. Perhaps 
it’s the belly-deep laugh that chases after her 
voice, sitting out-of-sight in the undercurrent 
of the song. 
The opening song, “Simmer,” is the most 
promising of what’s to come with Williams’ 
future solo work. The track starts off with 

layered sounds, adding on top of one another, 
like an engine slowly warming up. Immersed 
throughout are breathy gasps, reminiscent 
of Serge Gainsbourg’s infamously banned-
by-the-Vatican “Je t’aime moi non plus.” 
Here, too, is Williams’ voice unmistakable 
as distinctly Paramore. “Rage is a quiet thing 
/ you think you’ve tamed it / But it’s just in 
lying in wait,” the song shifting dynamically, 
whisper-soft then louder the next minute, 
mimicking the wavering control of the anger 
she sings of. The song features a unique call-
and-response structure, Williams’ singing 
answered by robotic-like voices –– emotion 
versus reason, an unending battle. 
Petals For Armor I presents a seemingly 
irreconcilable contrast, one side soft and 
sweet, the other hard and unyielding. 
Williams’ EP is as beautiful, soft and alluring 
as petals; her words are as biting, assertive 
and powerful as steel armor. Williams has 
a knack for presenting the unexpected, 
twisting and weaving songs that, while 
impossible on paper, take flight with the 
life she breathes into them. Undoubtedly, 
whatever Williams delivers next will 
be just as hypnotic and soul-clenching. 
Whether it’s 13-year-old angst or the wacky 
misadventures of adulthood, I’m sure she 
won’t disappoint.

The weird and the fun 
in Hayley Williams’ EP

My attention span has always 
been questionable — hour-and-
a-half lectures often send me 
scrolling through Twitter for 
a quick “break.” Even when I 
watch films at home, I have to 
be doing something to occupy 
myself for two hours. Focusing on 
a single story or set of characters 
for reviews is a weekly feat that I 
somehow manage to achieve. The 
2020 Oscar Live Action Shorts, 
however, provided a haven that 
I didn’t know existed. Averaging 
around 25 minutes, each short 
developed 
wholly 
individual 
stories and characters in such an 
effective and efficient time frame 
that there was little time to be 
bored.
From the dangerously funny 
lines of “laundry detergent” in 
“NEFTA Football Club” to the 
devastating end of “Saria,” these 
shorts prove that niche concepts 
create better and more engaging 
stories than the more general, 
mainstream messages often seen 
in popular feature-length films. 
Even the two more generic shorts, 
“A Sister” and “The Neighbor’s 
Window,” were able to create 
nuanced experiences for their 
audience. 
Discussing 
the 
female 
experience 
in 
a 
patriarchal 
world has grown in popularity 
in the last few years. Though this 
conversation has been ongoing, 
it has yet to lose its emotional 
strength, especially when films 
like “A Sister” continually provide 
new and relevant perspectives. 
Delphine 
Girard’s 
(“Caverne”) 
newest 
piece 
maintains 
an 
anonymous air — focusing on the 

shared experience of an emergency 
services worker and a woman in 
danger — reminding her audience 
that it could be any one of us sitting 
in that perilous passenger seat. 
The tension builds throughout the 
car ride — characters speaking in 
code, frantically searching for each 
other — creating an environment 
where, at this point, the audience 
really 
only 
cares 
about 
the 
woman’s survival. It’s a new take 
on an old fear that lends itself to a 
compelling story. 
In contrast, “The Neighbor’s 
Window” 
does 
the 
opposite: 
Clearly 
identified 
characters 
are developed and defined by 
the confines of their adjacent 
apartment 
buildings. 
On 
the 
surface, 
“The 
Neighbor’s 
Window” is like any other film 
about marriage and relationships 
as we age. Jealousy flies, wives 
are envious of their younger 
counterparts while husbands are 
yelled at for lounging around the 
house. But what distinguishes “The 
Neighbor’s Window” from other 
family dramas is the relationship 
between the two couples: There 
is no direct contact between the 
two. The audience and the main 
characters only know about this 
second couple because of a lack 
of drapes, the windows of the 
building across the street creating 
small movie panels within the 
viewing screen itself. Eventually, 
as these two parallel lives unfold, 
it 
becomes 
clear 
that 
“The 
Neighbor’s Window” is trying to 
highlight an age-old idea: You’re 
just watching through a window, 
everyone’s life seems perfect, but 
in reality, we’re all going through 
it. It’s a timely message in this age 
of social media. 
The other three nominated 

shorts, “Brotherhood,” “Saria” and 
“NEFTA Football Club,” take us all 
over the world, spanning a series 
of extremely specific scenarios 
that are still perfectly capable of 
connecting with their audiences. 
“Brotherhood,” for instance, looks 
at a family broken by ISIS. An 
estranged son returns home to 
a hostile environment, finding a 
disapproving father. The film asks 
us to consider what unconditional 
love means — would you forgive 
a child for abandoning family to 
pursue a cause? The story unfolds 
over a series of tense dinners and 
fun, brotherly activities. We see 
the relief of a mother who gets 
her child back and the excitement 
that a brother has returned. 
“Brotherhood” 
examines 
this 
family’s 
complicated 
dynamic, 
ultimately leaving its audience 
aching for the fleeting nature of 
their reunion. 
“Saria,” however, looks at what 
happens when someone doesn’t 
have a family at all. Based on the 
true story of the deaths at the 
Virgen de La Asuncion orphanage, 
“Saria” 
develops 
hopeful 
characters only to rip them away 
from the audience in a fire. The 
2017 tragedy on which the film is 
based took 41 lives, all of which 
were listed in the credits following 
the film. With pointed hints at the 
timeline, “Saria” highlighted just 
how focused on America we can 
be. The fire occurred in January 
2017, a month full of women’s 
marches and turmoil in the United 
States, ultimately resulting in a 
broad, baffling ignorance of the 
tragedies these girls faced.

This year’s group of Oscar-
nominated Animated Shorts are 
not lighthearted. There’s death, 
illness and abuse packed into their 
brief runtimes. Yet the ability to 
convey a moving story in a short 
amount of time is an achievement 
that should not be understated. This 
year’s shorts are beautifully and 
artistically created by hard-working 
teams from around the globe, labors 
of love that packed an emotional 
punch into short runtimes. Here are 
the Animated Shorts nominated for 
the 2020 Oscars, ranked.

5. “Kitbull” — USA, Directed 
by Rosana Sullivan
Pixar has been consistently 
creating short films since 1984, 
many of which have received 
Oscars. “Kitbull” is the third film in 
Pixar’s latest “SparkShorts” series, 
a program where they give their 
employees six months and limited 
funding to create an animated 
short. For this film, the result is a 
heartwarming tale of a scrappy 
stray kitten and a pit bull who form 
an unlikely friendship. The pitbull, 
who is abused by his owners, is 
still kind and loving. Watching 
the kitten grow to trust the dog is 
uplifting. The story is told through 
a more traditional form of hand-
drawn animation, which gives it a 
pleasing and comfortable feel.

4. “Dcera (Daughter)” — Czech 
Republic, Directed by Daria 
Kashcheeva
“Dcera,” Czech for “Daughter,” 
is emotional and visceral, telling the 
story of a daughter’s complicated 
relationship 
with 
her 
father, 
showing their estrangement before 

their eventual reconciliation. The 
stop-motion animation style is 
different and tangible, with the 
two character’s faces covered with 
streaks of black that add a sense of 
grime and imperfection. Despite 
being the longest of the nominated 
films at 15 minutes, “Dcera” is silent, 
conveying the father and daughter’s 
emotions through the movement of 
their eyes and their body language 
as they struggle to figure out who 
they are to each other.

3. “Sister (meimei)” — China/
USA, Directed by Siqi Song
“Sister” is narrated by a boy 
telling stories about his little sister 
in the 1990s — how they would fight 
over the remote or do silly things, 
like water a tooth to help it grow. 
Yet, partway through, it’s revealed 
that the sister is a figment of his 
imagination as he wonders what 
it would have been like to have a 
sister, since the one-child policy in 
China forced his mother to have 
an abortion when he was younger. 
The film’s team dedicated “Sister” 
to “the siblings we never had” from 
1980 to 2015, while the policy was in 
place. Using carefully crafted stop-
motion figures made of felt, “Sister” 
tells a story of what could have been.

2. “Hair Love” — USA, Directed 
by Matthew A. Cherry
“Hair Love” is an incredibly 
sweet story of a father-daughter 
relationship that made me tear up 
almost immediately. Zuri, a young 
African-American girl, is trying 
to style her hair by watching a 
YouTube tutorial and is failing 
impressively. When her dad walks in 
and tries to help her, he is way out of 
his comfort zone: There’s a hilarious 
sequence where her hair appears 
to take on a life of its own and the 

dad has to literally fight it. As a 
daughter of a dad who’d sometimes 
tried — and often failed — to do my 

pigtails when I was younger, it’s a 
sequence that dads and daughters 
can understand, even as the dad 
persists through his struggle and 
emerges triumphant. The short is 
the shortest of the nominees (seven 
minutes), but “Hair Love” has a 
whole lot of heart.

1. “Mémorable” — France, 
Directed by Bruno Collet
“Mémorable” 
is 
emotional 
and visually stunning, with an 
innovative 
use 
of 
animation. 
The figures are heavily textured 
and painted with thick, visible 
brushstrokes, giving it a sense 
that art has been embedded into 
the reality of this world. As Louis 
(a painter) begins to forget, his 
mental degeneration is expressed 
through the ways the animation 
changes: People appear misshapen 
and disfigured, objects appear to 
be melting around him, and soon 
he struggles to recognize his wife. 
It’s a heartbreaking depiction of 
a mind falling apart, told through 
a beautifully crafted medium as 
Louis’s artist’s brain morphs and 
shapes things into what they are not.

This year’s shorts 
are beautifully 
and artistically 
created by hard-
working teams 
from around the 
globe

From Musgraves to Shorr, an 
intro to the women of country

A lot has been written about the 
mistreatment of female artists in the 
country music industry. But for all of 
the headlines about TomatoGate, bro-
country and “rules” forbidding DJs from 
playing women back-to-back on their 
radio stations — nothing has changed. 
So, instead of rehashing the same tired 
narratives that highlight men’s power 
in the music world, I figured I would 
shed some light on the artists who, in a 
more just and equitable world, should be 
dominating modern country music right 
now.

The Essentials
It’s a shame, but even these legendary 
artists barely get any airplay.
Carrie Underwood — From the 
moment she stepped off the American 
Idol stage in 2005, Underwood has 
proven herself to be contemporary 
country music’s golden girl. She can play 
the revenge-hungry ex, all-American 
housewife and everything in-between 
with vocals that have an equally 
impressive range to match.
Miranda Lambert — The first time 
I remember seeing Lambert, she was 
setting a town on fire in her music video 
for “Kerosene.” She’s managed to keep 
up this rebellious image while tending 
to her softer side on some of her biggest 
hits like the vulnerable track “The 
House That Built Me.”
Kacey Musgraves — Even before the 
internet fell in love with Musgraves 
after her 2019 Album of the Year win at 
the Grammys, Kacey was doing country 
music 
her 
way. 
Always 
lyrically-
clever, instrumentally wholesome and 
thematically outspoken, Kacey’s no 
stranger to going up against the powers 
that be. Her LGBTQ+ affirming anthem 
“Follow Your Arrow ‘’ was banned from 
country radio in 2013.

Mostly Radio-friendly
It isn’t shocking to hear these women 
on country radio, but it’s not quite 
normal either.
Maren Morris — Between her monster 
pop hit “The Middle” with Zedd and 
her membership in The Highwomen 
— you’ve definitely heard Maren’s 
powerhouse vocals before. Sonically, 
her solo work lives at the center of those 
sounds. She’s bubbly in love on her latest 
GIRL: A glossy but forceful display of 

pop country. 
Kelsea Ballerini — I discovered Kelsea 
when Taylor Swift tweeted her approval 
of her first single “Love Me Like You 
Mean It” in 2015. Taking it as a sign 
that the next princess in Taylor’s line of 
pop country royalty had been crowned 
— I dove right in, and I’m glad I did. 
Ballerini’s music is fun, glittery and, as 
a student of Swift, very catchy. 
Carly Pearce — Pearce’s music is 
addictive. Her first album Every Little 
Thing came out in 2017 and I’ve returned 
to it at least a couple times a month ever 
since. Her songs sound like Southern 
hospitality and her voice is like honey.

Fresh Pop Country
A breath of fresh air in a snap-track, 
boom-clap world. 
Kelleigh Bannen — Sometimes a song 
will stop you in its tracks and that’s what 
Bannen’s “Damn I Still Love You” did to 
me. She has a talent for simultaneously 
sounding playful and soulful, masking 
her heartbreak with word play.
Jillian Jacqueline — Like so many of 
these women, Jacqueline is a storyteller 
— the difference is that she has a way 
of sounding like your best friend while 
doing it. Whether she’s poking fun at 
her own drama on “Tragic” or narrating 
the crumbling of a relationship on 
“Sad Girls,” she gets what you’re going 
through.

Country that Rocks
These women are badasses. That’s all.
Ashley McBryde —The songs released 
thus far from her upcoming album 
Never Will include a murderous, rocking 
warning to her Dad’s mistress “Martha 

Divine” and a catchy “it is what it is” 
admission of her “One Night Standards.” 
What’s more intriguing (or country) 
than that?
Kalie Shorr — Shorr is true to the 
title of her album Open Book. Addiction, 
depression, her sister’s death and her 
own eating disorder — it gets messy, but 
that also means it gets real. 

Singer-Songwriters
Maybe they aren’t officially “country,” 
but they’re so good I’m claiming them 
anyway.
Caitlyn Smith — Smith has presence. 
Her voice is like liquid gold and with 
top-notch songwriting, the stories she 
tells are worth every penny. I still can’t 
get enough of her debut album Starfire.
Emily Scott Robinson — Listening to 
Robinson is like walking alongside a 
babbling brook. Her voice immediately 
grounds you in the present, but her 
storytelling takes your mind elsewhere. 
She’s a wanderer and her clear, rootsy 
voice invites you with her.

The Almost Break-Throughs
If they were men, things would be 
different.
Cam — Her song “Burning House” 
was a Grammy nominated hit in 2015 
and her album Untamed is just that: 
Bursting with energy and unafraid to 
break boundaries into pop and folk. 
Somehow Cam can do everything at 
once and still make it sound organic.

DAILY MIDWESTERN COLUMN

The musical roots 
of the Midwest

MAXWELL SCHWARZ
Daily Midwestern Columnist

The world would be a mighty 
silent place had it not been for 
Little Walter wailing on a harp 
with Muddy Waters egging 
him on in Chicago come 1950 
or thereabouts. In that instant, 
the Chicago Blues were born — 
urban blues, electric blues. The 
sound filled Chicago and it came 
to define it. It was the moment 
when the music of the Midwest 
was born. This is to say nothing 
of the influence of other artists, 
such as Duluth-native Robert 
Zimmerman, better known as 
Bob Dylan, of course.
Which is all to say the 
Midwest has sound. It trembles. 
There is music in these roads, 
nestled deep in these pines. It is 
folk, it is country, it is the great 
Americana backbeat pressing 
back against your tires as you 
cruise up I-94 through Madison, 
WI. From Minnesota’s own 
Jayhawks (who produced the 
masterpieces 
“Hollywood 
Town Hall” and “Mockingbird 
Time”) to Allison Krauss — 
the queen of Americana who 
hails from Decatur, Illinois. To 
those artists whose boots are 
dirty and sounds are rich, to 
those reclaiming country from 
Nashville and putting it back in 
the Heartland where it belongs, 
I do tip my hat.
We have a hillbilly-tinted 
concept 
of 
country 
music, 
dominated by fake twang and 
pop sentimentality. Country 
music may have been born in 
Bristol, Tennessee, but that kind 
of music was meant for folks all 
over every stretch of America 
to which a dirt road leads you. 
The Midwest is dotted with 
rust towns and green towns 
and towns where the wheat 
swallows up old tractors and 
metal Tonka trucks. There are 
all sorts of Midwesterners to 
whom country music sounds 
like home. Take, for example, 
the guy who fixed my tire when I 
was stranded in Onaway. Or my 
dad, who walks his property on 
the weekends and checks to see 
how much maple sap collected 

in the buckets for him to make 
maple syrup. Even this guy I 
once saw drinking a Budweiser 
and driving a tractor down 29 
Mile. These are country folk. 
You can see it in their eyes.
Michigan 
band 
Frontier 
Ruckus 
has 
been 
steadily 
putting out what I can only refer 
to 
as 
criminally-underrated 
folk-Americana 
since 
2007. 
I cannot recommend “Way 
Upstate 
& 
the 
Crippled 
Summer,” both parts 1 and 2, 
enough. Frontman Matthew 
Milia’s warbling, intense lyrics 
find a cozy nook in between the 
banjos and rusty chords.
Lord Huron — an LA-based 
indie folk crew made up of 
Michigan natives — produces 
some of my favorite music, 
by far. Their debut album, 
“Lonesome Dreams,” has just 
enough distant ambience to 
remind you of how beautiful 
the loneliness of nature can be. 
“She Lit a Fire” is particularly 
striking, with dancing, sparkly 
chords that blend into the 
ambience. 
Their 
sophomore 
album, “Strange Trails,” plays 
heavy to a country-rock vibe. 
Tunes like “Meet Me in the 
Woods” and “Love Like Ghosts” 
are 
spectral 
and 
haunting, 
buried 
deeply 
within 
the 
mythos of solitude peppering 
Michigan’s natural splendors.
Yet, the heart of Midwestern 
roots 
is 
Minnesota 
— 
specifically the Twin Cities. 
For proof, grace your eardrums 
with Garrison Keillor’s folk 
spectacle 
“A 
Prairie 
Home 
Companion,” which played live 
from the Fitzgerald Theater 
in St. Paul. The show has since 
been 
renamed 
“Live 
From 
Here,” with Punch Brothers 
frontman Chris Thile taking 
over hosting duties. Essentially, 
the show features skits, music 
and performances by folk, blues 
and Americana artists of all 
kinds, oftentimes performing 
twangy impromptu renditions 
of newer songs.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
Salvant and Diehl prove jazz is 
still relevent at the Mendelssohn

NATALIE KASTNER
Daily Arts Writer

There are few moments in our 
fleeting lives that lead us to be struck 
with gratitude: the birth of a child, 
true love, near death miracles, and 
for me, the concert of Cecile Mclorin 
Salvant and Aaron Diehl. There was a 
moment during a very beautiful étude 
that Aaron Diehl played, right after 
an acapella vocal section by Salvant, 
where I could not stop smiling, even 
in the middle of February, in the 
thralls of seasonal depression. 
The young duo, exquisitely artistic-
looking and effervescently endearing 
in their charisma, played two shows 
at the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater 
Thursday night. This performance 
acted as a jam session elevated to its 
highest form. As I walked into the 
theater, a very jolly usher handed me 
a program and with a wink said, “The 
program is, there is no program.” 
Diehl and Salvant riffed off of each 
other for which song they wanted 
to perform next. It was obvious how 
well the couple knew one another. 
Within a few seconds of suggesting 
a song, the two were off and running 
with one fabulous arrangement after 
the other.
When I think of jazz, the first 
thing that comes to mind is not 
necessarily the storytelling. I think 
of smokey dark rooms with men 
crouched over their instruments all 
in rhythm with each other. With the 
performance by Diehl and Salvant 
I saw a new side of jazz. Each song 
was a story. Salvant was constantly 
making specifically informed choices 
with her voice to tell a story. It wasn’t 
just the lyrics. She would cry out one 
section and chew the words out in 
another. At her most passionate, her 
voice enveloped the Mendelssohn 

with a warmth that I did not think 
could be mastered by someone at 
the age of 30. Salvant’s velvet voice 
shifted qualities effortlessly and 
with complete control. It wasn’t her 
standing and singing before us, her 
whole body contorted and shifted to 
compliment the sound.
Diehl matched her in artistic 
mastery, but was far more subdued 
in his performance. He only stood 
to bow once during the show when 

he modestly gave us a smile, but the 
rest of the show we only got to see his 
profile as he concentrated on the keys 
— this added to the enchantment of 
his sound. When the lyrics fell short 
as a result of their old-fashioned 
nature, Diehl filled in the subtext. In 
a song like Burt Bacharach and Hal 
David’s “Wives and Lovers,” which 
is obviously past its time, Diehl was 
able to reinvigorate the story through 

his musical accompaniment. It made 
these beloved standards relevant 
again; his performance was not just 
a rote rendition but a commentary on 
the place of these songs in the world 
today.
Even though I am a lover of the 
“Great American Songbook,” I can’t 
help but cringe at how outdated some 
of the songs are. Diehl reworked 
these tunes into ones worthy of the 
21st century again. By manipulating 
the music that backdropped lyrics 
about a cozy “cottage for two,” Diehl 
illustrated 
the 
coercive 
themes 
present in many of these songs, 
exemplifying how vocal jazz can 
survive the rapidly-changing culture.
The 
second-to-last 
tune 
they 
played was in honor of their friend 
who was a drummer. Salvant didn’t 
go into what happened, but it was 
obviously something tragic because 
the 
following 
performance 
was 
incandescent. Even with the flu 
going around and people coughing 
throughout the night, there was not 
a single sound through the 10 minute 
segment. The room was silent in 
reverie. 
The way Salvant set up the evening 
allowed for that sacred experience 
at the end. Throughout the show, 
she spoke to us as if we were a close 
friend she had just met at a coffee 
shop. She spoke about awkward 
romantic experiences, her favorite 
artists and her friendship with Diehl 
as if we deserved to know, and not 
like we all bought a ticket to see a 
Thelonious Monk winner. She was 
charming, endearingly innocent and 
authentic. 
Both Salvant and Diehl are off 
to the next town, but their impact 
will stay with me. The good news 
is, Salvant was here last year too, so 
chances are she will stop by again. 
Hopefully along with Diehl.

With the performance 
of Diehl and Salvant I 
saw a new side of jazz. 
Each song was a story

TV REVIEW

JUSTIN POLLACK
Daily Arts Writer

It’s unfair to compare NBC’s new comedy 
“Indebted” to the recently departed “The 
Good Place” just because they’re both NBC 
comedies that air on Thursdays. These 
shows have little in common — nowhere are 
their differences more evident than in the 
execution of their respective premises. “The 
Good Place” took one of the most complex 
sitcom premises on network television and 
accomplished it with ease. On the other end 
of the sitcom spectrum, “Indebted” takes 
one of the most basic premises and struggles 
to give its audience a reason to care.
Dave (Adam Pally, “The Mandalorian”) 
and Rebecca (Abby Elliott, “How I Met 
Your Mother”) are excited to “get their 
closets back.” They are finally moving 
out of the toddler phase of parenting, and 
starting to reclaim their adult lives. Then 
Dave’s parents show up with unnecessarily 
complicated stories about how they are in 
debt because they love vacations and have 
no health insurance. Also, Dave has a sister 
(Jessy Hodges, “Barry”) who is nothing 
more than a pile of lesbian stereotypes 
with no characterization. “Indebted” is 
constructed around a simple narrative — a 
relatively young couple has to deal with the 
man’s socially unaware and clingy parents. 
The whole episode should’ve 
raised the eyebrows of parents 
everywhere.
Filming in front of a live-
studio audience makes multi-
camera television different than 
single-camera, as the actors 
must be more performative. 
The parents, played by Steven 
Weber (“13 Reasons Why”) and 
Fran Drescher (“The Nanny”), 
seem much more comfortable 
than Pally and Elliot. But that 
doesn’t excuse what feels like 
relatively cheap dialogue. As 
misunderstood as technology 

is by grandparents, dialogue like “the 
tweeter” and “airBLT” ha the sole purpose 
of getting uninspired canned laughter from 
Drescher’s character. The loudest laughs 
are reserved for anytime one of the parents 
makes a simple statement about sex, which 
the writers must assume is inherently funny 
simply because the characters are old. 
It remains uncertain if the show will ever 
recognize the potential that “Indebted” has 
to contribute to the discourse about cost 
of healthcare in the United States and the 
parenting styles of Millennials and Boomers. 
I couldn’t tell you how Dave’s parents 
moving in will affect their lives, why his 
parents have no concept of savings or what 
any of the characters do for a living. Simply 
put, the table-setting is just horrible.
I am hoping that the lack of character-
based humor in favor of repetitive gags could 
just be a symptom of it being the pilot. For the 
show to succeed, it must spend more time 
on building the histories of the characters, 
which the pilot spent zero time on. Based on 
this first episode, Dave seems to be relatively 
unaffected by the carefree lifestyle of his 
parents. The most successful version of this 
show would focus on how the parents spent 
their way into massive debt and how their 
efforts to spoil Dave and his sister impacted 
each of them respectively. Unfortunately, 
after one episode, NBC gives us no reason to 
care.

DeJulius growing through sophomore season

After the Michigan men’s 
basketball team upset No. 16 
Michigan State on Saturday, 
77-68, a photograph started to 
pop up all over social media.
In it, as the jubilant Maize Rage 
in the background celebrates the 
Wolverines’ 
statement 
defeat 
of 
the 
Spartans, 
sophomore 
guard David DeJulius embraces 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard. 
DeJulius’ eyes are closed in 
some mixture of gratitude and 
exhaustion while Howard soaks 
up his surroundings in awe and 
relief. 
Both men pause amidst the 
triumphant chaos around them, 
each taking in the moment, 
stopping to acknowledge their 
appreciation for each other.
“I saw David walking, heading 
toward the tunnel to go walk to 
the locker room,” Howard said. “I 
looked over to my right, and I just 
recalled throughout the game 
that David had affected the game 
in a lot of ways.
“… David was a guy who 
gave us a big spark in the first 
half. I was just so proud of how 
he competed, and I wanted to 
acknowledge him, and let him 

know that, as a team and a coach, 
thank you for all the hard work. 
That hug was an embrace of — he 
knows it. I love him. That’s what 
that energy and what that hug 
meant.”
The shadow of Zavier Simpson 
is not an easy place to live. But 
that’s where David DeJulius has 
spent the last two years.
Watching. Learning. Growing. 
It wasn’t always easy.
“You 
might 
get 
a 
few 
minutes 
at 
a 
time, so you’re 
trying to make 
sure 
that 
you 
make a basket 
or 
something,” 
DeJulius 
said 
in 
November. 
“(It) was really, 
really rough for 
me (last year), 
because I really spent a lot of time 
devoting my life to basketball, so 
it was really tough not playing.”
But the star senior point 
guard’s remaining days in Ann 
Arbor are numbered, and the 
specter of graduation has served 
as a reminder of the fact that one 
day in the not-so-distant future, 
Michigan will need to replace 
Simpson.

This season has made one 
thing clear: David DeJulius will 
be key in doing that.
After 
a 
freshman 
season 
spent largely on the bench, in 
his sophomore season, DeJulius 
has shown his worth off it. He’s 
averaging a little over seven 
points and two rebounds and 
seeing around 20 minutes a 
game. When the team traveled 
to Lincoln to take on Nebraska 
without 
the 
suspended 
Simpson, 
DeJulius started 
and 
played 
34 
minutes. 
“To 
have 
a 
guy like David 
DeJulius 
step 
up and be more 
vocal, especially 
during 
times 
where the team 
was making a run, or we may 
have had a turnover, or we may 
have given up a shot, he came in,” 
Howard said after the Nebraska 
game. “At timeouts, holding guys 
accountable, 
holding 
himself 
accountable, it was good. It was 
good to see that.”
But even with Simpson in 
the lineup, DeJulius has been 
far from quiet. He’s had nine 

double-digit scoring nights this 
season, including a career-high 
14 against Oregon in December 
and — perhaps most excitingly 
for a kid out of Detroit — 10 on 
Saturday against Michigan State.
“David has been rock-solid 
all year,” Howard said Tuesday. 
“Yes, someone will look at the 
stats, look at the points. I don’t 
look at it from that point of view. I 
look at it as far as what he’s doing 
out there on the floor to help the 
team and affect the game in any 
kind of way to give us the best 
chance to win. 
“I recognize in practice each 
and every day that David has 
that approach. He comes in with 
the right attitude to work, to 
improve.”
It’s a conversation DeJulius 
and 
Howard 
have 
often, 
a 
conversation they had Monday. 
Before practice, DeJulius called 
Howard, saying “I’m all in. You 
can never ever second-guess or 
think that I’m not all-in.”
Howard’s response: “David, I 
have not once been afraid or have 
guessed or assumed that you’re 
not.”
As he gets more minutes, he’s 
growing more, playing better. 
He’s taking every chance to 
make sure he gives himself more 
chances. He’s getting his shot, 
and he’s running with it.
With energy like that, it’s 
looking more and more likely 
his chances aren’t going to be 
running out anytime soon.
“David hasn’t once walked in 
the door and not competed, has 
not came in practice and bring 
that effort and that attitude of 
how can he improve,” Howard 
said. “So, if he continues with that 
type of mindset, which I know he 
will, I just see years to come — he 
has two more years, and we have 
two more years to teach him and 
develop him — that I see some 
really great things happening 
for David at the University of 
Michigan, and I know a big goal 
of his is to play on the next level. 
“I would do everything I can to 
help him get to that dream.”

Ciccolini out for year

Freshman 
forward 
Eric 
Ciccolini had shoulder surgery 
Monday and will miss the 
remainder 
of 
the 
season, 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said Tuesday.
Pearson didn’t name the 
specific 
injury, 
but 
said 
Ciccolini came to Ann Arbor 
with it and has been playing 
through it all season. His 
shoulder has been subluxing 
— sliding in and out of socket, 
repeatedly 
dislocating 
— 
throughout 
the 
season, 
and it got to a point where 
continuing to play through it 
didn’t make sense.
“He was playing with it all 
year, and about a week and a 
half ago, it happened again in 
practice,” Pearson said. “Not a 
hit, just an innocent little play 
and it got to the point where 
it was hard for him to play. … 
He could’ve played the rest of 
the year and had it after the 
season, but then it gets into 
your recovery time for the 
following year, because it’s a 
six to eight-month recovery.”
Ciccolini played in 26 of 
28 games prior to his surgery 
and ranks seventh on the team 
in points with 11 total. His 
10 assists are second on the 
team.
“I think you just saw a little 
bit of the player that he’s 

going to be,” Pearson said. 
“Having to play with that all 
year was — I give him a ton of 
credit. The mental toughness 
to have to grind it out through 
that, I mean just not knowing 
when it’s going to slide out on 
you.”
The 
surgery 
had 
been 
scheduled 
“for 
a 
while”, 
Pearson 
said, 
but 
even 
as 
recently 
as 
this 
past 
weekend’s 
series 
against 
Wisconsin, Ciccolini wasn’t 
completely certain he’d opt 
to end his season early. But 
after discussing it with senior 
forward Will Lockwood and 
associate 
head 
coach 
Bill 
Muckalt, both of whom have 
undergone similar surgeries, 
Ciccolini decided to go ahead 
and fix the issue.
With the six to eight-month 
recovery, Ciccolini projects to 
be back on the ice around the 
time the Wolverines pick up 
practice in the fall.
“I 
think 
this 
weekend 
(against Wisconsin), you could 
tell a little bit, he just played 
without that fear or trepidation 
that it might happen again,” 
Pearson said. “He just played, 
because he already knew the 
date and there was nothing 
that was going to mess it up. I 
give him a lot of credit. When 
your shoulder pops out, it’s 
painful. It’s not fun. But he’ll 
be ready to go next year, that’s 
the main thing.”

Michigan seeks to replace pitchers

Last season, only one left-
handed pitcher beat No. 1 
UCLA.
His name is Tommy Henry, 
and he did it twice. 
Henry pitched 13 innings 
against the Bruins in two starts, 
one in March and one to send 
Michigan to the College World 
Series in June, allowing only 
four runs while striking out 16 
batters with his sharp fastball 
and elusive slider. These starts 
were a microcosm of his final 
campaign, during which the 
lanky left-hander pitched like 
a true ace and earned a 12-5 
record with a 3.27 ERA.
Henry was paramount to the 
Wolverines’ success in 2019. 
He and fellow starter Karl 
Kauffman combined to chew 
through over 250 innings in 
a season that entranced the 
college baseball world.
2019 was one of the most 
successful seasons in Michigan 
baseball history. But the dust 
has finally settled from that 
season, and the two workhorse 
pitchers the Wolverines rode 
to their duel with Vanderbilt 
in the College World Series no 
longer play in Ann Arbor. 
Kauffman 
and 
Henry’s 
absence begs the question: 
What comes next?
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
many 
starting rotation positions are 
in question, but the approach to 
filling them is not.
“The way we approach the 
roles is that you look at who 
your Friday night guy is, and 
you’re looking for consistency 
and a guy that can go out there 
and make a quality start,” 
Bakich said. “A guy who’s got 
the best chance to put up as 
many zeros as possible. A guy 
who’s got three pitches for 
strikes. After that it’s the next 
best version of that and the next 
best version of that.”
To some, the solution is that 
the next wave of pitchers who 
sat behind Kauffman and Henry 
need to rise to the occasion to 
fill the open roles — to step up 
in lieu of the duo’s departure. 

Bakich disagrees. 
“That (rise to the occasion) is 
exactly what we try not to say,” 
Bakich said. “This is something 
we stole from the Navy SEALS: 
‘We don’t rise to the occasion, 
we sink to the level of our 
training, and we just hope 
that the level of our training is 
higher than the occasion.’ ”
Junior starting pitcher Jeff 
Criswell is perhaps the best 
example of why the Wolverines 
prefer the latter mentality. The 
6-foot-4 
right-hander 
from 
Portage, Mich. has trained 
at one of the highest levels 
available to college baseball 
players; 
with 
Team 
USA. 
Having done so, he is the heir 
apparent to Henry.
“To have a Michigan baseball 
player go play for Team USA is 
pretty awesome,” Bakich said. 
“The confidence that he got 
from that, in addition to the 
confidence from pitching both 
as a starter and a reliever, is 
important. He was very valuable 
for us last year, and he has gone 
from being maybe more of a 
thrower as a freshman, to a true 
pitcher with three-plus pitches, 
to a guy who’s regarded as one 
of the best amongst his peers.
“We’re glad to have him, and 
we’re sure glad he’s pitching for 
us on Fridays.”
With Criswell expected to 
be the pitching staff’s ace this 
year, the question remains as 
to who will fall in behind him, 
and the answer is currently 

unknown.
“We feel like we’ve got 
some pretty good options in 
those two, three and four 
spots,” Bakich said. “That’s a 
competition that’s going on 
right now.”
Among 
those 
options 
is 
freshman 
Cam 
Weston, 
whom Criswell himself sees 
as impressive, and there are 
talented 
arms 
in 
redshirt 
sophomore Ben Dragani and 
redshirt 
freshman 
Steven 
Hajjar — both of whom seek to 
return strongly from injuries 
sustained last season. This 
is not to mention redshirt 
sophomore right-hander Isaiah 
Paige, who filled in many 
pitching roles last season, and 
junior right-hander Blake Beers 
whom Bakich cited as a player 
who could potentially play a 
prominent role this season.
The Wolverines may have 
only decided on one rotation 
spot heading into the week 
of their first game, but it is 
clear that they do not see their 
situation as dire. 
“I feel exactly the same 
heading into opening weekend 
now as I did last year,” Bakich 
said.
And for anyone who watched 
Tommy Henry pitch seven 
innings of two-run baseball 
against No.1 UCLA to send 
Michigan to the College World 
Series, that sounds much more 
like a signal of confidence than 
one of worry.

‘M’ falls to Iowa on Senior Night

Despite No. 2 heavyweight 
sophomore Mason Parris’ pin 
over No. 3 redshirt freshman 
Tony Cassioppi, the No. 22 
Michigan wrestling team (6-4 
overall, 5-2 Big Ten) fell to No. 1 
Iowa (11-0, 8-0), 27-9, on Senior 
Night.
Redshirt freshman Joey Silva 
secured one of two Michigan 
wins Saturday night, beating 
Iowa’s Paul Glynn, 7-5. Already 
down 3-0 heading into the 
second match of the night, Silva 
momentarily tied the dual at 3-3 
in team score. Glynn managed to 
tie up the match at 5-5 late, but 
an escape by Silva secured the 
win for the Wolverines.
“Joey 
did 
a 
great 
job 
throughout 
the 
match,” 
Michigan coach Sean Bormet 
said. “One thing is continuing to 
manage weight control. He did 
a really good job managing his 
weight in weigh-ins. It’s really 
all about managing that recovery 
piece. I saw some great things 
offensively for him and he did a 
really nice job on top.”
However, things became grim 
for the Wolverines after Silva’s 
win, as they dropped the next 
seven matchups. Five of those 
matchups 
were 
within 
four 
points, but the rankings favored 
Iowa in nearly every matchup.

Michigan came closest to 
another 
win 
when 
redshirt 
sophomore Jelani Embree faced 
off with Iowa’s Cash Wilcke. 
With a score of 3-2 in Wilcke’s 
favor late in the third period, he 
strayed to the edge of the mat. 
Embree attempted to wave him 
back into the circle, but even 
after receiving a stall warning, 
Wilcke remained near the edge 
of the mat.
“It was a situation where 
Jelani needed to have more 
match 
strategy 
and 
mat 
awareness,” Bormet said. “The 
Iowa 
wrestler 
was playing the 
edge a bit, and 
I’m not sure if 
Jelani realized 
the official had 
called the Iowa 
wrestler 
there 
for 
stalling 
when he was 
hanging 
and 
hovering around 
the edge of the 
mat. There were still 12 seconds 
left, and Jelani was walking back 
in trying to bait him to come into 
the center and he wasn’t coming 
back into the center.”
The 
headlining 
match 
of 
the night came last in the 
heavyweight category, as Parris 
faced off with Iowa’s Cassioppi. 
It began evenly matched, with 
Parris and Cassioppi gaining 

control over each other at 
different points. However, in 
the second period, Parris was 
able to pin Cassioppi to the 
mat in Michigan’s second win 
of the night, keeping himself 
undefeated on the season.
“It was a great confidence 
booster for me,” Parris said. 
“I went out there with a lot of 
confidence 
already. 
He 
was 
my last high school loss, so I 
definitely wanted some revenge 
with him. I just wanted to go out 
there and beat him.”
Parris’ 
vengeful 
win 
was 
ultimately 
in 
vain. Regardless 
of his score, the 
Wolverines’ 
previous 
shortcomings 
already put the 
dual out of reach. 
Still, 
against 
the 
best 
team 
in the country, 
Michigan’s 
wrestlers 
found an opportunity to test 
themselves.
“Every opportunity when you 
compete, you have to go into it 
to get better,” Bormet said. “We 
talk about how you wrestle a 
style where you’re constantly 
trying to get better and improve. 
You can do that even in a loss 
and you can not do that even in 
a win.”
