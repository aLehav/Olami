Opiate overdoses spike 
in Washtenaw County

Increasing 
tuition: a 
look at why 
costs rise

DPSS, county 
sheriff’s office 

respond to increased 

hard drug use

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

At the end of June, every 

University of Michigan police 
officer will carry Naloxone, a 
generic version of the name-brand 
drug Narcan that reverses the 
effects of an overdose by blocking 
opiate receptors in the brain. This 
new training and policy comes two 
years after the Washtenaw County 
Sheriff’s Office began combating 
peaking opioid overdose numbers 
in the area. The University of 
Michigan Police Department is 
currently working on adding this 
additional officer training in the 
face of an increasing number of 
young people overdosing. 

Marlene 
Radzik, 
the 

Washtenaw County Sheriff Office’s 
police services commander, said 
among the products acquired by 
the department between 1998 and 
2000, powder and crack cocaine 
were the most common. Now, 
heroin is the drug of choice for 
young people between the ages of 
15 to 30.

A growing epidemic

It has been 12 years since 

31-year-old 
Ashton 
Marr, 
an 

Ann Arbor resident, was first 
prescribed 
Vicodin 
for 
an 

emergency appendectomy.

“I was able to maintain the 

image that I was doing okay, but 
my addiction hit a new low,” Marr 
said. “It was like it just took over 
my life and my mind.”

She has long since healed from 

her 2004 surgery, but the effects 
of Marr’s introduction to opioids 
left her with a frustrating, painful 
addiction. After starting the drug, 
continued use was all too easy. 
Marr said that even though she 
began to experiment with drugs as 
a student at Pioneer High School, 

she began to spiral out of control 
when she began studying at 
Washtenaw Community College.

“It was actually easier for me to 

get illegal drugs than it was for me 
to get alcohol,” Marr said. “People 
get started taking old prescriptions 
that they find in the medicine 
cabinet.”

Radzik is also well-versed in 

the heroin epidemic in Washtenaw 
County — she has been on staff 
with Washtenaw County Sheriff’s 
Office for 27 years and worked as 
an undercover cop from 1998 to 
2000. When starting road patrol in 
1991, she said, it was extremely rare 
to respond to a heroin overdose.

“If we did, it was normally — I’m 

not saying this is a positive thing 
— it was usually a long-term, older 
user that had other health issues,” 
Radzik said.

According 
to 
Washtenaw 

County 
Public 
Health, 
more 

than 400 residents overdosed on 
opioids between 2011 and 2015.

Hike in revenue 
outpaces other 

public universities

By LYDIA MURRAY

Summer Managing News Editor

Last Thursday, the University of 

Michigan Board of Regents voted 
to increase tuition by 3.9 percent for 
in-state students and 4.4 percent for 
out-of-state students. This change 
will result in an increase in tuition 
revenue of $86.35 million.

Since 2002, tuition revenue has 

increased by over $800 million — a 
135 percent increase — far outpacing 
similar institutions such as Ohio 
State University and the University 
of California system, both of which 
have seen approximately 52 percent 
increases. Both universities also face 
similar state funding decreases to 
those within the state of Michigan. 
This comparison raises the question: 
Where is this money coming from 
and where it is going?

State Funding

The 
increase 
in 
projected 

tuition revenue coincides with a 
proposed increase in state funding 
of 4.2 percent for the University. 
This state-funding proposal is the 
latest in a series of small increases 
following a 21.6 percent funding 
cut the University experienced in 
2011 under Gov. Rick Snyder’s first 
budget, which featured an across-
the-board 15 percent cut in funding 
for higher education.

The latest increase in state 

funding brings aggregate funding for 
Michigan’s higher education budget 
back to pre-2011 levels; however, the 
University’s individual state funding 
still remains 7.8 percent lower than 
2011 levels.

Various regents at Thursday’s 

meeting cited state disinvestment as

Engineering students and faculty respond 
to gender and minority gap at the University

In spite of DEI plan, 
women and ethnic 
minorities are still 
underrepresented 

By ALEXA ST.JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

“When I was deciding to do 

computer science, one of the main 
reasons that I didn’t want to do 
it was I never saw myself as the 
computer science type because I 
think that type is typically male,” 
LSA junior Kayla Fedewa said. 
“That was one of the main things 
that was holding me back.”

Fedewa, 
vice 
president 
of 

the student organization Girls 
in Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science, said she is one of 
many females associated with the 
University of Michigan’s College of 
Engineering and computer science 
programs who is affected by a lack 
of female enrollment and lack of 
support for females within the 
programs. Because of this, Fedewa 
said she was weary when first 
looking into the program.

“You really have to be strong, 

I feel like, to be in the program in 
a way that you don’t have to be in 
other programs,” Fedewa said.

Though Fedewa said she feels 

she can speak her mind and gain 
access to the same opportunities 
male students have, other female 
students do not feel the same.

Betsy Brown, a recent doctoral 

graduate 
from 
the 
Chemistry 

Department 
and 
previous 

co-vice president of the student 

organization Females Excelling 
More in Math, Engineering and 
the Sciences, said she struggled 
with deciding on a major because 
of 
the 
overwhelmingly 
male 

populations in certain Science 
Technology Engineering and Math 
(STEM) departments, adding that 
stayed away from the more male-
dominated fields that left her 
feeling uncomfortable.

“I avoided situations that might 

make me feel like that,” Brown said. 
“I felt more comfortable in a more 
heterogeneous situation where it 
wasn’t all men.”

Brown agreed with Fedewa and 

said it can be a challenge for women 
to feel comfortable and self-assured 
in these fields.

“As a woman in science, it’s 

harder to find the confidence 
that doesn’t seem to be a problem 
for male peers,” Brown said. “In 
talking with (other women), I’ve 
heard a lot more self-doubt than 
I did with talking to our male 
counterparts.”

Fedewa 
and 
Brown 
have 

both been successful in their 
departments as student leaders of 
their organizations, but they and 
other students have faced much 
adversity based not only on gender, 
but race as well.

Enrollment

According to the University 

Enrollment by Program, Location, 
Ethnicity and GenderReport as 
of Winter 2016, a total of 8,723 
students were enrolled in the 
College of Engineering — with 
2,206 females and 6,517 males.

Minority students have less 

representation in the College of

likely to unintentionally overdose 
on heroin — with an average age of 
overdose of 32 — while unintentional 
prescription opioid overdoses were 
more common among older white 
women, with an average age of 51.

There is no discernible set of risk 

factors — such as socioeconomic 
status, parental occupation or a 
familial history of drug use — that 
can be tied to the recent chain of 
overdoses. Often, a child is injured 
in a sport or at a park and needs 
some kind of surgery. Years later, 
they continue an addiction to the 
painkiller first prescribed to them 
following the operation.

As the number of fatal overdoses 

in young adults and children spiked 
in 
Washtenaw 
County, 
Radzik 

started asking questions — and 
parents tended to repeat a similar 
narrative.

“Every story that I heard was the 

same: that their child had a sports 
injury and was given Vicodin or 
Oxycontin or in a car crash,” Radzik 
said. “Soon they’re addicted; they’re 
buying pills off the street.”

Marr’s story follows a similar path 

after her surgery. She described her 
childhood with sentimentality: She 
loved Girl Scouts, did gymnastics, 
weathered her parents’ divorce, but 
says she felt normal as a kid. After 
addiction found its way into her life, 
she said, everything changed. Living 
mostly out of her car, she felt tired, 
miserable and alone.

“Addiction for me was a very 

isolating experience, and I was 
really ashamed of it,” Marr said. 
“It was like it just took over my life 
and my mind, and I really was up 
and running with opioids. I truly 
believed I was the only heroin addict 
in Ann Arbor.”

New policies and combative 

treatments offer some hope, though. 
In the first five months of officers 
carrying Naloxone in 2014, the 
Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office 
reported officers’ use of the drug 
saved 11 lives. 

According to Radzik, the number 

has risen to 26 since last December. 
Naloxone could have saved even 
more lives back when the number 
of overdoses first peaked in 2012, 
she said, but the department had to 
wait for a bill allowing non-medical 
personnel to administer the drug.

The sheriff office’s supply is 

currently funded by a grant that 
was facilitated by the Washtenaw 
Opioid Project, a community-based 
collaborative effort organized in 
July 2013 as part of the Washtenaw 

Health Initiative. Their aim is to 
improve 
access 
to 
coordinated 

care for the county’s low-income, 
uninsured and Medicaid-supported 
populations. The grant is currently 
funding the replacements for the 
office’s now-depleted supply of the 
Naloxone.

In the sheriff’s office, police are 

trained to administer Naloxone 
regardless of whether or not they 
can confirm the user took an opioid, 
as Naloxone has no harmful effects 
to an individual not experiencing 
an overdose. They are trained to 
administer another dose within five 
minutes of the first because the drug 
could wear off and the victim could 
resume overdose effects. Inserted 
through the nose, Naloxone could 
stay active in the body between 30 to 
90 minutes, depending on a person’s 
metabolism, while opioids can last 
up to two hours.

University response

While marijuana and prescription 

drug use have been consistent issues 
on campus, hard drug use has been 
climbing at the University as well, 
according to a 2015 report, and 
administrators across a number 
of campus units are beginning to 
respond to the recent spike.

Last December, the University 

Injury Center held an Opioid 
Overdose 
Summit 
to 
educate 

researchers, community members 
and 
those 
involved 
in 
the 

pharmaceutical field on current 
prescription drug opioid research, 
to prevent overdose mortality and 
to discuss other unresolved issues. 
Central 
Student 
Government 

also tried to raise awareness by 
launching 
a 
prescription 
drug 

misuse campaign during the winter 
2016 semester.

The 
University’s 
Division 
of 

Public 
Safety 
and 
Security 
is 

adding additional officer training 
as well. DPSS spokeswoman Diane 
Brown said, beginning in July, all 
University police officers, including 
housing security officers, will have 
access to and will be trained in the 
deployment of the Naloxone.

“We are right now finishing up 

our week-long training on a variety 
of subjects,” Brown said. “It takes us 
several weeks for us to be able to take 
our whole group of people and put 
them in training. We do it in rounds, 
and so, by the end of the month, we 
will have finished the last of those 
rounds.”

Brown said witnessing an opioid 

overdose could be difficult to discern 
right away, which is why the training 
is so important.

“When you come upon somebody, 

there’s a wide variety of things, 
particularly if they’re unconscious, 

which overdose tends to apply,” 
Brown said. “But then there’s the 
situations where people are going 
into an unconscious state from a 
drug interaction, and sometimes 
those can be a wide variety of 
responses based on the person.”

Withdrawal and the road to 

recovery

Radzik 
said 
purchasing 

prescription opioids at the street 
level could range from $30 to $50 
in some cases, so users often turn 
to cheaper methods of substance 
abuse.

Marr made the switch to heroin 

after several years of abusing 
Vicodin.

“I 
didn’t 
seek 
out 
heroin. 

Somebody proposed it to me when 
I complained that Vicodin wasn’t 
doing it for me anymore,” Marr said. 
“I’m shocked today to hear how easy 
it is to come by drugs; many times 
it was people that I already knew, 
friends. When I made the transition 
from 
opioid-based 
prescriptions 

to heroin, I would snort it, but that 
became less and less effective — I 
built a tolerance to it — so I resorted 
to taking it intravenously.”

Marr said she had a dealer and 

would take trips to Detroit, though 
she said such trips are not necessary, 
as she claims heroin is available for 
sale in Washtenaw County, including 
Ann Arbor.

Radzik said the user, is in many 

cases, not the only one who suffers, 

as families bear much of the burden 
financially and otherwise.

“When a family loses a child to 

heroin, they have to say, ‘But they 
were such a good kid,’ ” Radzik 
said. “When a family loses a child to 
cancer, they don’t have to say that.”

Marr described how her addiction 

began to take over her life.

“I needed more and more of it to 

not feel sick,” Marr said. “It wasn’t 
about getting high anymore. I need 
it to function, not just emotionally 
but physically.”

Marr said she never feared 

anything more than the feeling of 
withdrawal.

“My bones felt like glass,” Marry 

said. “I felt sick to my soul, crawling 
out of my skin — I felt, I’m not sure 
how to describe it. You’re hot and 
cold at the same time. You can’t sit 
still, but you feel even sicker trying 
to get up and pace around. That is 
a contributing factor as to why I’m 
still in recovery. I don’t ever want to 
do that again. It’s awful.”

During her time suffering from 

heroin addiction, Marr was almost 
entirely isolated from the support 
of her family and friends, whom she 
kept in the dark about her condition, 
mostly because she was afraid they 
would associate her with the stigma 
attached to drug addicts.

“I mostly hid it from my friends,” 

Marr said. “Addiction for me was a 
very isolating experience, and I was 
really ashamed of it. Being from Ann 

Arbor, there are certain substances 
that carry less of a stigma.”

Marr said she relocated to a 

halfway house in Brighton after 
several months of treatment before 
she moved back to a transitional 
home in Ann Arbor.

Along with the Brighton Center 

for Recovery, which helped Marr 
recover from her addiction, there 
are dozens of other recovery efforts 
in the area. Besides the Washtenaw 
Recovery Advocacy Project, there 
is The Home of New Vision, which 
provides 
treatment, 
transitional 

housing, 
counseling 
and 
peer 

support services throughout the 
county.

Matt Statman is the program 

manager for the University branch 
of the Collegiate Recovery Program, 
a nationwide initiative that offers 
non-clinical support to students in

problems. The program launched 
at the University in 2012 as part of 
Wolverine Wellness — a section of 
the University Health System aimed 
at supporting and promoting healthy 
behaviors related to alcohol, drugs 
and sexual health — and is funded by 
student health fees.

“We are really focused on social 

support, helping students that are 
in recovery support each other,”

ather’s Day always sneaks 
up on me. I’ll be studying 
or watching TV, and all of 

a 
sudden 
an 

ad will appear, 
always saying 
something 
like 
“Here’s 

the best gift you can get for your 
dad” or something. The pang that 
always comes along with seeing 
stuff father-related doesn’t sting 
as much as it once did — I’m 
usually able to move on with my 
day without any issue. I’ve learned 
that this type of pain isn’t going 
away, but I’ve also learned how to 
live with it.

Let me explain: the summer 

before my first year of high school, 
my father passed away from 
pancreatic cancer. This period 
of time, the time that my father 
was sick and dying, has strongly 
affected my outlook on life and 
has defined me as a person. I 
honestly couldn’t tell you what 
I would be like if my dad were 
still alive — perhaps less serious, 
less empathetic, more carefree. 
In all honesty, the traits that I 
have gained since my father’s 
passing are some of the ones that 
I value the most. I try not to think 
about what life would be like if 
my dad were still alive — he’s 
not coming back and any time 
spent wondering is, to me at least, 
counter-productive. I’ve come to 
accept his death — I’m no longer 
angry about it, and I’ve stopped 
claiming that the world is unfair. 
I’m even pretty good at stopping 
myself 
from 
getting 
jealous 

at my friends who have good 
relationships with their fathers, 
because hey, why shouldn’t they 
be able to enjoy what I’m not able 
to? This is the main reason why 
I try not to have a problem with 
Father’s Day.

Still, Father’s Day presents an 

awkward problem for me and my 
family. Usually, around Father’s 
Day, people will politely ask one 
another what they plan on doing 
to celebrate. I’ll usually answer 
something like “I’ll give my 
grandpa a call” or “I’m visiting 
my uncle.” A lot of the time, the 
person asking the question will 
accept my answer. Some of the 
time, the person asking will look 
a little confused, as if I hadn’t 
answered the question correctly, 
but won’t continue with any more 
inquisition. Rarely, the person 
asking will bring up the question 
“Why aren’t you spending any 
time with your father?” which 
usually starts an uncomfortable 
but short conversation about how 
my father passed away — it was 
cancer, thank you for your apology. 
It’s not that I don’t like talking 
about my father — in all honesty, 
I enjoy talking about him. He was 
an interesting guy and a loving 
dad, and he has given me a lot of 
good stories. And the profound 
effect that his death has had on 
my life and personality means that 
someone can’t truly understand 
me until they understand what 
I have gone through. So in daily 
life, I don’t really try to avoid the 
topic of my father’s death. Yeah, I 
guess it sometimes makes people 
uncomfortable, but I’d rather talk 
about it on my own terms instead 
of having others ask me about it.

So 
why 
does 
being 
asked 

about Father’s Day make me 
uncomfortable? 
I 
guess 
it’s 

because a part of me is always 
expecting someone to ask, “So why 
aren’t you spending any time with 
your father?” Though, admittedly, 
this only happens rarely, I still 
feel the sting, as if the fact that 
my father has passed meant that 
I can no longer celebrate Father’s 
Day the ways it’s supposed to 
be celebrated. Commercials and 

advertisements 
that 
support 

the heteronuclear family only 
work to exacerbate this feeling. 
This belief that one must have a 
father to celebrate Father’s Day 
is inherently problematic. For 
14 years of my life, I was lucky 
enough to have had a father, but 
others have been blessed with 
two parents of a same gender, a 
single parent, grandparents, along 
with their own variations of what 
family means. Where are the days 
for these types of parents and 
these types of families?

I’m not suggesting that we 

change the name of Father’s 
Day, and I’m not asking for those 
with fathers that they have good 
relationships with to start feeling 
guilty. I just wish that Father’s Day 
was a bit more flexible. People need 
to stop assuming that everyone 
has a father or that everyone has a 
good relationship with their father. 
Father’s Day shouldn’t exclusively 
be about the man whose genetics 
you share — it should be about the 
masculine people in your life who 
have positively affected you.

This past Sunday, my sister 

and I went to a restaurant in Ann 
Arbor that we believe our father 
would have liked, and we talked 
and reminisced about our father. 
After, I gave my grandpa and one of 
my uncles a call to thank them for 
all that they have done for me. My 
sister and I aren’t the only people 
who didn’t celebrate Father’s Day 
in the traditional sense — people 
all over celebrated this day in the 
way that best corresponds to the 
masculine figure in their life. I 
hope that we all remain sensitive 
to this, and that we don’t forget 
that Father’s Day, and any other 
day dedicated to family, is what we 
make of it.

either of these politicians’ careers 
would have virtually ended had 
they been caught for doing what 
they admitted to doing.

In 2014, law enforcement across 

this 
country 
arrested 
700,993 

people 
for 
marijuana-related 

incidents. Of those 700,993, 88 
percent of them were for possession 
of marijuana.

There is a certain irony in 

incarcerating 
Americans 
for 

actions that the highest level of civil 
servants have admitted to doing. 
Furthermore, there is a tremendous 
financial, social and economic cost 
to incarcerating Americans for 
possession of marijuana (among 
other non-violent drug offences).

In his final year in office, 

President Obama should take steps 
that work toward the legalization of 
marijuana, starting with a mandate 
that the federal government will 
refuse to fund incarcerations for 
marijuana-related crimes. Doing so 
will save precious tax dollars, give 
correctional officers much needed 
bandwidth to pursue violent crimes, 
and siphon money away from black 
markets and into the coiffeurs of a 
federal government that has run 
a large deficit for the past several 
decades.

According to the Urban Institute 

Justice Policy Center, we spend an 
average of $21,006 per person per 
year to incarcerate someone in a 
minimum-security prison in the 
United States. With total U.S. debt 
at more than $19 trillion, this does 
not feel like money well-spent.

The other side of the economic 

cost is the toll that incarceration has 
on the labor force. It not only takes 

years away from people’s working 
lives, but it teaches this population 
how to become better criminals. 
Better-trained 
criminals 
mean 

more resources will be siphoned 
away from police departments as 
well.

Keeping people out of the 

correctional system for non-violent 
drug offenses is another benefit 
of marijuana legalization. In an 
interview in Vice with Jeff Smith 
— a professor in urban policy at 
the Milano School of International 
Affairs, Management, and Urban 
Policy in New York — and a former 
inmate, they recounted how jails 
can be a dehumanizing place filled 
with rape and how many prisons 
are permissive of rape among the 
inmates. Furthermore, according 
to Smith, “In prison, your bonds 
with 
law-abiding 
society 
are 

being broken down and your bond 
with other criminals is being 
strengthened.” The human cost of 
the correctional system is felt when 
inmates’ relationships to society 
get eroded and as these individuals 
exit prison, they struggle to find 
housing, job opportunities and 
rehabilitation.

Legalizing marijuana has the 

potential to bring in millions 
of dollars in tax revenue. As of 
February 
2015, 
Colorado 
has 

generated over $53 million in 
tax revenue, which was short of 
estimates that the measure would 
bring in more than $70 million in 
the first year.

As of October 2015, 58 percent 

of 
Americans 
back 
marijuana 

legalization, up from 36 percent in 
2003. In Michigan, the necessary 
number of signatures (320,000) 
were gathered, but a recent rule 
change 
means 
that 
marijuana 

legalization will probably not be on 
the ballot in November.

Meanwhile, 
marijuana 
gets 

dismissed in national politics as 
an issue for stoners, with many 
politicians putting it low on their 
priority 
list. 
President 
Obama 

said that marijuana legalization 
is not one of his top priorities 
for 2016. However, there are few 
issues 
where 
executive 
action 

has the immediate potential to 
save tens of billions of dollars and 
keep hundreds of thousands of 
non-violent offenders out of jail. 
Marijuana is one of those issues, 
and we should all care more about 
legalization.

I

’m a firm believer that 
relationships of all kinds 
— be it platonic, sexual, 

romantic, 
familial, etc. — 
take work, as 
I’m sure most 
other 
people 

are. Someone 
recently 
told 

me, “You don’t 
seem 
like 

the 
kind 
of 

person who’d 
waste 
time 

doing something they’re not 
good at.” They’re right. It’s why 
I don’t play basketball or try to 
be a model with my 4-foot-11-
inch stature. It’s why my subpar 
mathematical abilities keep me 
from studying to be an engineer. 
I feel very much the same about 
my relationships. If I’m not 
“good” at keeping a healthy 
relationship, I’ll cut someone off. 
I just don’t see the point in trying 
to uphold a bond that simply is 
not working. More particularly, 
I — with few exceptions — don’t 
think staying friends with my 
exes right after a breakup is at all 
plausible or necessary.

To 
most, 
this 
is 
surely 

a 
character 
flaw. 
Being 
a 

perfectionist in an aspect of 
life that is far from capable of 
being perfected seems fruitless; 
keeping 
people 
who 
mean 

something significant to you in 
your life should be a priority. 
But if it is at a detriment to your 
mental wellbeing, is it worth 
it? Plenty of my friends keep in 
close touch with their various 
ex-boyfriends and girlfriends, 
not thinking anything of the swift 
change in the dynamic of their 
relationships, which is great for 
them. I’m impressed that they’re 
able to do that. Not all of these 
friendships go off without a hitch 
though — most are riddled with 
jealousy and awkward tension. 
For me, I don’t think it’s the 
change from romantic to platonic 
that doesn’t sit right; I think it’s 
the people I’ve dated who have 
so wholly put me off to this idea 
of being friends after a breakup. I 
can’t seem to overlook the things 
about my exes or the flaws in our 
relationships that made it all fall 
apart in the first place. 

I’ve been broken up with, as 

well as done the breaking up. 
I’ve been in a mutually-decided 
breakup as well. All were times 

I never wanted to continue the 
relationship platonically, nor did 
I see that option being beneficial. 
The 
toxicity 
that 
surrounds 

the decision to end a romantic 
relationship is inevitably there 
even if not always at the surface. 
Traits once considered endearing 
about your significant other now 
grind into the deepest recesses 
of your existence regardless of 
whether or not you’re the one 
who broke things off. How can 
you cultivate a healthy friendship 
with 
someone 
if 
somewhere 

within 
your 
relationship 

there’s bound to be some sort 
of resentment for the end of the 
relationship?

Not only are you bothered 

immensely by the little things 
your ex does, but also there will 
inevitably come a time when 
one of you finds someone else. If 
I’ve learned anything from the 
many romantic comedies I’ve 
watched while single and eating 
Häagen Dazs by the pint, it’s that 
communication all but breaks 
down between people when a 
third party is involved.

Suddenly texting your ex to 

ask if they have your T-shirt you 
spilled wine on that one time 
turns into this big dark secret 
from your current significant 
other for fear of hurting them 
with 
your 
strictly 
platonic 

relationship with the person you 
once dated. All right, maybe I’ve 
watched too much of “The OC” 
in my homework-free stupor of 
summer, but there is definitely 
a possibility of a friendship 
with an ex causing strain in any 
current relationship you might 
pursue. 
Even 
the 
strongest 

people sometimes feel insecure, 
and keeping someone around you 
may have had something special 
with in the past can feel like a 
threat. To me, it’s not worth it.

Relationships that had to end on 

the basis of bad timing stemming 
from any variety of reasons or 
any variety of circumstances out 
of your control can potentially be 
different. I’ve never experienced 
this, but I’m sure if I did, I’d 
react to whether or not I’d keep 
that person around quite a bit 
differently. Until that happens, 
however, I’m going to happily 
leave my exes in the past where 
they belong.

T

hrough my job this summer, 
I have met many people who 
have fled their countries 

due to gender-
based violence, 
political 
persecution 
and incredibly 
dangerous 
gangs who have threatened their 
lives and the lives of their families. 
And at the end each day, when I’m 
tired or upset about something in 
my own life, I can’t help but feel 
that I had no right to be concerned 
with these things. They’re nothing 
compared to what others are going 
through. Others endure so much 
worse.

And while it is true what I am 

preoccupied by is of a completely 
different nature (and magnitude) 
to those who are making dangerous 
journeys to find a safe place to live, 
the constant comparison between 
our problems and those of your 
friends, family, coworkers and 
acquaintances (to name a few) is 
unhealthy because it perpetuates 
the idea that we have to be silent in 
our struggle.

My friends often confess that 

they feel bad being upset about 
things going on in their lives — 
divorcing 
parents, 
a 
troubled 

relationship or a health problem 
— when they know someone 
has it much worse. I often hear 
comparisons to people who go 
without food, clean water and 
shelter. “At least I have it better 
than they do,” my friends say, 
shrugging 
off, 
pushing 
down, 

diverting their own emotions and 
stressors because they don’t think 
they have a right to be upset about 
them.

But 
every 
hardship, 
every 

struggle is unique. My friends are 
right to notice that their struggles 
and those of someone who is 
fleeing persecution or is without 
food and water are not of the same 
magnitude, but the reality is we all 
face struggles in some way. And we 
should be allowed to voice anger, 

frustration and sadness about the 
things that are hard in our lives.

As college students, we are faced 

with many social and academic 
stressors 
that 
can 
sometimes 

overcome us and contribute to 
whatever else we are facing in our 
lives. College is a privilege, but 
there are definitely times where 
it can feel more overwhelming 
and 
anxiety-producing. 
If 
we 

are not comfortable, validated 
and supported in speaking about 
what is stressful, worrisome and 
anxiety-producing to us, we can 
feel alone. College has its own 
unique stressors, which we can 
only attempt to handle if we are not 
constantly told we have it better 
than X or Y.

Society 
talks 
a 
lot 
about 

perspective. “But to put it into 
perspective, at least I have it better 
than others who don’t have clean 
water or enough food”or “At least 
I’m not the family on TV who lost 
their son” are things I hear all the 
time when people are talking about 
what is going on for them. They’re 
addendums, as if the person is 
saying, “Don’t worry, I know my 
struggles aren’t much compared 
to what others face.”And while 
perspective is important to realize 
that traffic or a broken nail aren’t real 
hardships, we must allow ourselves 
to feel upset by struggles in our 
lives. I believe we can recognize 
and value someone else’s situation is 
more dire and at the same time not 
have to simultaneously discount our 
real feelings and real worries about 
our own situations and hardships. 
Feeling empathy for someone’s tragic 
situation is not mutually exclusive 
with silencing your own feelings 
about your situation because you 
perceive the other as worse.

Even if a person isn’t facing 

starvation or lacking clean water, 
they should be allowed to feel upset. 
We should be safe and validated 
when we talk about something hard 
that is going on in our lives. Our 
loved ones and close friends are here 
for us (or they should be) during 

the good and the bad, the happy 
and sad. They shouldn’t be here to 
tell us that there is someone who is 
going through worse so we should 
shut up and be grateful for what we 
have. Yes, we need to understand 
and acknowledge where we are 
very lucky and be grateful for that. 
But what we also have to do is see 
that our struggles — incomparable 
to anyone else’s — are valid in their 
own right.

I am fortunate in many ways. I 

am lucky to have opportunities as 
a result of my high-level education. 
I have a loving family and receive 
endless support. I have access 
to good food and clean water. I 
live very comfortably in many 
regards. But I also go through 
hard moments in my life and want 
to turn to family and friends for 
support and sometimes a shoulder 
to cry on. Without these support 
systems, if I felt like I could never 
talk about what was going on for 
me because my hardships were 
nothing compared to those around 
me, I would keep things bottled up. 
Over time, I would begin to feel 
alone and isolated, and it would 
only make something difficult 
infinitely harder to cope with. 

It shouldn’t be one or the other; 

it shouldn’t be a competition of who 
has it worse. We all go through 
hardships that differ in nature but 
should be treated as well-founded 
in their own way. We can’t feel that 
we shouldn’t talk about problems 
because they seem menial, less 
than those of others. We should 
be allowed to talk about them, feel 
heard and be comfortable looking 
to others for support during trying 
times. As a society, while we should 
help each other to acknowledge 
the difference between different 
hardships, we must help each other 
through them as well. We need to 
have compassion for ourselves. 
Otherwise, how can we have 
compassion for others?

TV REVIEW

‘Finding Dory’ a 
swimming hit

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

Watching “Finding Dory” was an 

early sign that I’m getting old at the 
oh-so mature age of 19. However, the 
fact that it cap-
tured my imagi-
nation 13 years 
after 
watching 

the original is 
a testament to 
how strong and 
enduring Pixar’s 
brand and sto-
rytelling is. The 
audience had a 
wide 
array 
of 

ages in attendance. There were both 
parents and people my age who 
surely watched the predecessor 
“Finding Nemo” back in 2003, and 
young children who were first expe-
riencing the franchise in theaters 
around the same age I did. To avoid 
beating around the bush, “Dory” 
does not go above and beyond the 
originality of “Finding Nemo.” But 
truth be told, it’s a very high bar 
to set, and a bar that “Dory” man-
ages to at least meet, if not exceed — 
something that can’t be said by most 
animated movies.

The film’s standard is largely due 

in part to Dory’s (Ellen DeGeneres, 
“The Ellen DeGeneres Show”) irre-
sistable charm. She stole the show in 
“Finding Nemo” as wonderful comic 
to Marlin’s (Albert Brooks, “Drive”) 
straight-man protagonist. With this 
film, it’s finally her story that’s being 
told. Dory has short-term memory 
loss (which she will not let you for-
get), and has become fed up with her 
condition. She begins to remember 
her two wonderful parents, Char-
lie (Eugene Levy, “American Pie”) 
and Jenny (Diane Keaton, “Annie 
Hall”). Although there is no thor-
ough explanation as to what trig-
gers these memories, DeGeneres’s 
voice acting is so sweet and sincere 
that one can’t help but feel for her 
frustration. Dory has flashbacks of 
her life at the Marine Life Institute 
in Morro Bay, a very specific loca-
tion in California where sea animals 
are rehabilitated and released back 
into the wild. The plot quickly takes 
the form of “Finding Nemo,” as our 
favorite animated fish (sorry, “Shark 
Tale”) must once again go on a jour-
ney of epic proportions to reunite 

lost family members. Her new “fam-
ily” of Marlin and Nemo himself 
(newcomer Hayden Rolence) are 
here for the adventure too, bring-
ing back what made the original 
movie compelling, while treading 
on familiar territory.

Rest assured, enough new ideas 

are injected into the plot to keep 
“Finding Dory” fun and origi-
nal. The sea creatures that Dory 
and gang meet along the way are 
delightful, played skillfully by some 
of the hottest comedic actors in 
show business. Among these char-
acters is Hank (Ed O’Neill, “Modern 
Family”), a chameleon-like octopus 
who craves the stable life of captiv-
ity and accompanies Dory on her 
quest. Though he ends up serving 
much of the same role that Marlin 
did in the first film, he’s entertain-
ing all the same.

The animation is beautiful, an 

area in which “Dory” manages to 
surpass its predecessor successful-
ly. I remembered several trips I’ve 
made to aquariums while watch-
ing the film, largely because of the 
lush and alive computer-generated 
sea in “Finding Dory.” After watch-
ing the film, I realized the immer-
sion I experienced, thanks to the 
gorgeous graphics, is a big part of 
why I enjoyed the original “Finding 
Nemo.” But while other animated 
movie companies may be satisfied 
at solely achieving Pixar’s surface-
level mastery, its writing is what 
manages to set Pixar apart from its 
competition.

Dory is truly a character to root 

for, though her supporting cast 
falls by the wayside at times. A lot 
of action is crammed into the film, 
making it a wild ride to follow. But 
there is a lovely message at its core 
that ties it all together: your fam-
ily will always be with you in your 
heart.

Don’t watch this movie if you 

haven’t seen “Finding Nemo.” The 
appeal Dory’s short-term memory 
loss had in the last film when it was 
used as comic relief might be lost on 
an uninitiated viewer, as “Finding 
Dory” respectfully treats it much 
more seriously as a mental impair-
ment. That being said, the endearing 
family connections portrayed with-
in the film make it a satisfying addi-
tion to Disney’s canon, and a worthy 
sequel to “Finding Nemo.”

‘Black’ is back in deep, 
well-crafted fourth run 

Drama’s latest season 

tackles complex 
themes and ideas

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

When “Orange is the New 

Black” debuted on Netflix in 
the summer of 2013, the main 
 

narrative 
focused 
on 

the journey of 
Piper Chapman 
(Taylor 
Schilling, “The 
Lucky 
One”), 

a 
privileged 

white woman 
who adapts and 
tries to survive 
a 
15-month 

sentence 
in 
Litchfield 
Penitentiary, 
a 

minimum-security 
women’s 

prison. However, since then, the 
series has gradually broadened 
from a raunchy prison dramedy 
into 
something 
much 
more 

humanistic. 
Throughout 
each 

season, 
we’ve 
learned 
about 

almost all the individual prisoners 
via flashback sequences, giving 
us their backstories that are as 
engrossing as they are tragic. 
By humanizing these women as 
victims of circumstance rather 
than simple criminals, “OITNB” 
brings a nuanced perspective to 
the criminal justice system, which 
continues to be showcased in its 
fantastic fourth season. 

While season four can feel 

overstuffed at times, it stands out 
against the previous seasons of 
“OITNB” by diving deeper into 
the lives of its characters and how 
they have developed over their 
time in Litchfield.

Reeling in from last season’s 

glorious finale, the season four 
premiere, 
“Work 
That 
Body 

For Me,” is a stunning return to 
form, as every facet of the show’s 
storytelling 
— 
the 
character 

work, the dialogue, the drama 
and the humor — comes into 
full throttle. After the Litchfield 
inmates bask in some fleeting 
moments of freedom in the nearby 
lake, they’re quickly rounded 

up back to the prison, where the 
aftermath of their euphoria is 
met with overwhelming terror. 
New arrivals are brought to 
Litchfield, causing a lack of 
resources, 
commotion 
and 

overcrowding. Included in the 
throng of new inmates are two 
of season four’s most interesting 
new personalities: Judy King 
(Blair Brown, “Fringe”), a TV 
personality 
cook, 
and 
Alison 

Abdullah 
(newcomer 
Amanda 

Stephen), a Muslim woman who 
becomes the roommate of recent 
Jewish 
convert 
Black 
Cindy 

(Adrienne C. Moore, “30 Rock”). 
Both Brown and Stephen play 
their 
characters 
marvelously, 

with the former evoking a sinister 
mix of Paula Deen and Martha 
Stewart and the latter generating 
an engaging, refreshing presence 
within Litchfield.

With these new introductions, 

the 
burgeoning 
racial 
and 

socioeconomic 
class 
divides 

among the Litchfield prisoners are 
also highlighted and subsequently 
provide 
a 
sharp 
social 

commentary. 
Racial 
dynamics 

have always played a large role 
in 
“OITNB,” 
considering 
its 

large cast of Latina, Black, and 
Asian characters. But a bitter 
semi-race war between Piper 
and the Latina prisoners, led by 
Maria Ruiz (Jessica Pimentel, 
“Person of Interest”), and a petty, 
mean-spirited quarrel between 
Alison and Black Cindy prompts 
a thought-provoking discussion 
about how the grittiness of 
prison life can reflect the world 
around us. Particularly gripping 
is the show’s handling of racist 
beliefs, which attribute to the 
relationships between the horrible 
security guards and the Litchfield 
inmates. 
The 
prisoners 
are 

already treated terribly with the 
conditions they’re living in, but 
with the addition of Litchfield’s 
racist and misogynistic head 
guard Piscatella (Brad William 
Henke, “Fury”), things get very 
ugly. 

Even with large improvements 

on plot and character development, 
the fourth season still struggles 
with some flaws, one being that 
the flashback sequences aren’t as 
emotionally potent as the ones 
from seasons before. The season 
somewhat glosses over some of 
its more compelling characters, 
Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox, 
“Grandma”) and Nicky Nichols 
(Natasha Lyonne, “Portlandia”), 
who are demoted to recurring 
roles, most likely due to other 
commitments 
— 
Alex 
(Laura 

Prepon, “That ‘70s Show”) had 
a similar situation in the show’s 
second season. Regardless, the 
fourth season keeps on pushing 
boundaries with its absorbing 
storytelling and provocative plots.

At this point, “OITNB” has 

cemented its place as one of the 
most complex, well-crafted and 
entertaining television shows of 
the 2010s — and season 4 is its 
highest point. With its diverse 
array of characters — women 
of color, women with mental 
illness and women who are on the 
LGBTQ spectrum — the series is a 
defining example of how modern 
television shows should represent 
people who aren’t normally seen 
on TV. Yes, there’s still plenty 
of 
sex, 
drugs, 
violence 
and 

cursing. But the newest season of 
“OITNB” has demonstrated the 
show is less about one woman 
struggling against the harshness 
of imprisonment and more of 
a microcosm of our imperfect, 
messy cesspool of a society.

Top Four Games of E3

VIDEO GAMES COLUMN

E

3 is a strange beast. It’s 
often been called the 
“Super Bowl” of the 

video game industry. Though it 
certainly has the commercial-
ism to match 
America’s big-
gest sporting 
event, I’d be 
more compelled 
to compare it 
to the Detroit 
Auto Show 
— another 
tradition of 
American 
capitalism, a 
future-embrac-
ing technological display in 
which the biggest companies 
in the industry show off their 
shiniest, most advanced prod-
ucts yet. This year in particular 
felt packed with new titles in 
development, so much so that 
my original list of ten excellent-
looking games blossomed into a 
list of twenty. The following are 
unveiled video games that I think 
you should pay attention to in the 
coming months and years, avail-
able on a diverse selection of plat-
forms and release windows.

Final Fantasy XV (Square 

Enix, PC, PS4 and Xbox One, 
September 30th, 2016)

I love the idea of a road trip 

within a video game — an idea 
that likely thanks to technologi-
cal limitations hasn’t been imple-
mented in many games besides 
“The Last of Us.” Surprisingly, 
the latest game in the ludicrously 
prolific “Final Fantasy” franchise 
seems to be fully dedicated to 
such an idea. The game is focused 
on a group of four anime-inspired 
male characters on a road trip 
together — the inspiration of 
films like “Stand By Me” being at 
once subtle and completely overt. 
This is one of two games on this 
list that I’ve had the chance 
to actually play, and upon first 
glance the gameplay is heavily 
inspired by “Kingdom Hearts.” 
It’s unsurprising, since “KH” 
director Tetsuya Nomura took 
the franchise over from longtime 
franchise director Hironobu Sak-
aguchi for this one. After the last 
console entry in the series failed 
to impress most of the people that 
played it, it’s wonderful to see a 
“Final Fantasy” game that looks 
to be coming from a place of real 
heart and inspiration.

Resident Evil VII (Capcom, 

PSVR, PC, PS4 and Xbox One, 
January 24th, 2017)

That the latest game in the 

“Resident Evil” franchise would 
be built from the ground up for 
Virtual Reality is a surprise almost 
no one saw coming. In fact, it’s 
probably the biggest news from E3, 
period — and on top of that, they 
released a playable demo to anyone 
with PlayStation Plus at Sony’s 
conference. It was so cool not only 
hear this incredible news, but to be 
able to get my hands on the game 
the very next day. And I’m happy 
to report that the game looks and 
sounds absolutely incredible. In 
fact, the demo was tense enough to 
make me never, ever want to play 
it with a Virtual Reality headset. 
That amount of immersion doesn’t 
vibe with how much of a scaredy-
cat I am at all. Regardless, it’s 
insane to see the huge franchise 
pivot once again from the much-
maligned action game format of 
“RE6,” instead going for a much 
subtler psychological horror expe-
rience reminiscent of Konami’s ill-
fated “Silent Hills.”

God of War (Sony Santa Moni-

ca, PS4, ~2017)

IIf you had told me two weeks 

ago that I would give any amount 
of a shit about a new “God of War” 
game, I would not have believed 
you for a second. I can’t believe I’m 
sitting here putting it at the top 
of this list. I’m absolutely floored 
that “Sony Santa Monica” ’s sequel 
not only looks absolutely amazing 
graphically, but looks completely 
reimagined from the ground up. 
Deviating thoroughly from the 
character action genre in favor of 
over-the-shoulder third-person 
action, “God of War” takes the 
angsty, ultra-violent character 
of the demigod Kratos and gives 
him some much-needed depth, 
establishing an intense, caustic 
relationship between an older 
version of him and his son. The 
combat now takes inspiration from 
“Dark Souls” rather than “Devil 
May Cry,” emphasizing dodging 
and timing over mindless button 
combos. The new weapon, an Ice 
Axe that can be recalled from any-
where like Thor’s hammer, is stu-
pidly awesome. The shift to Norse 
mythology from Greek mythology 
is inspired. Everything about this 
game looks like a both a major risk 
and a product of absolute passion 
for big-budget game design.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of 

the Wild (Nintendo, NX and Wii 
U, ~March 2017)

“The Legend of Zelda” is my 

favorite video game series. It’s 
the favorite video game series of 
so many people. It’s an eternal 
franchise so storied and treasured 
by fans that it holds one of those 
special places where it’s subject 
to the highest of scrutiny — when 
people care very deeply about 
something, like Batman or Harry 
Potter or Zelda, they are harsher 
towards it than anything else. 
Reviewers often claim particular 
entries in the series are “great, but 
not for a Zelda game” or something 
similar. Anytime any trailer is 
released for a Zelda game these 
days, it’s instantly criticized by 
anything deemed by fans to be 
outside of the norm, and it has 
proved difficult for Nintendo to 
innovate within the franchise 
without pissing off large portions 
of their fanbase. It’s a small wonder 
to me that the reaction to the new 
footage of the excellently named 
“Breath of the Wild” has been 
universally positive, from both 
critics on the E3 show floor and 
from fans at home, even though 
the game seems to be taking the 
biggest risks the series has ever 
taken. A prominent physics-based 
puzzle system? Ragdoll? Cooking 
and crafting? Weapon degradation? 
Weather that affects player health? 
Are you kidding me? “Breath of the 
Wild” looks innovative, heartfelt, 
and strikingly gorgeous, adopting 
the aesthetic of Hayao Miyazaki’s 
animated classics like “My Neighbor 
Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” 
And it’s Zelda’s biggest world yet. 
According to Nintendo, the huge, 
lengthy demo they showed was 
merely 1% of the game’s final scope 
— a daunting notion to say the 
very least. The development of this 
game is emblematic of a Nintendo 
that’s backed into a corner and 
hissing, coming off of the failure of 
the Wii U platform and seemingly 
more ready than ever to deliver an 
absolute classic (which, if I may 
add, they haven’t done since 2010’s 
“Super Mario Galaxy 2”). Nintendo 
needs “Breath of the Wild” to 
be a timeless masterpiece, and it 
certainly looks (and feels, according 
to the lucky bastards that have 
played it) to be shaping up to be one.

‘Puberty’ grows

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Usually if you mention any-

thing 
from 
your 
pubescent 

years, you face universal cring-
ing at best and 
total revenge 
at worst. But 
Mitski’s latest 
album, Puber-
ty 2, willingly 
revisits 
the 

emotional 
turbulence 
of self-doubt, 
loneliness and sadness — a 
cocktail of confusion that never 
truly leaves us as we age. Jump-
ing easily between plucky punk 
rock, mellow guitar riffs, bright 
electronic beats and shimmer-
ing dream pop, Puberty 2 is a 
lifetime’s worth of introspec-
tion in a lean 30 minutes.

Though she sings of sad times, 

Mitski eyes her self pity with 
razor sharp wit, never devolv-
ing entirely into melodrama. 
In “Happy,” a supposed lover 
leaves in the morning before 
she wakes up. Hollow mechani-
cal whirring and quiet vocals 
swing into boppy electric guitar 
riffs as she accepts the situa-
tion. Wryly, she sings, “I sighed 
and mumbled to myself / Again I 
have to clean.”

Her gift for lyrics reaches new 

heights in “Your Best Ameri-
can Girl,” a sorrowful crooner 
about coming to terms with 
her Japanese-American heri-
tage — the only thing standing 
in the way of a fairytale ending 
with her soulmate. She sings, 
“Your mother wouldn’t approve 
of how my mother raised me 
/ But I do, I finally do / You’re 
an all American boy and guess I 
couldn’t help try to be your best 
American girl.” It’s a complex 
and introspective tug-of-war 
between assimilation and defi-
ance, one road being easy and 

showered with benefits and the 
other 
being 
mind-blowingly 

difficult, but honorable all the 
same.

Though Puberty 2 speaks of 

sadness, it isn’t glossy, rose-
tinted sadness dolled up like a 
Lolita poster. In “Once More to 
See You,” a daydreamy waltz, 
her voice trembles so gently 
and hopefully for an unrequited 
lover that it feels like we must 
avert our eyes and afford her the 
dignity of private shame. But in 
the pain of overhearing also lies 
the beauty.

The punk-rock angst dials all 

the way up in “My Body’s Made 
of Crushed Little Stars,” a defi-
ant middle finger to the laws 
of physical mortality. Cavern-
ous vocals thrash above a thick, 
staticky wall of sound, angrily 
yelling, “I wanna see the whole 
world / I don’t know how I’m 
gonna pay rent.”

In a world where people 

and ideas move on to the next 
faster than ever, “I Bet on Los-
ing Dogs” is a gravestone to the 
lonely souls that get left behind. 
Floating out from shimmer-
ing synths and hazy acoustics, 
Mitski sings, “I bet on losing 
dogs / I know they’re losing and 
I’ll pay for my place / By the ring 
/ Where I’ll be looking in their 
eyes when they’re down / I’ll be 
there on their side / I’m losing 
by their side.”

Listening to Puberty 2, I sud-

denly feel very small, like I’ve 
transported back into a warm 
dark cocoon of blankets on a sad 
night. The sum of every teen-
age sorrow returns, clearer than 
ever, but then pours back out in 
an exhilarating catharsis. These 
emotions may be painful, but 
Mitski’s voice creates an impen-
etrable force field, circling lov-
ingly around me, a space of utter 
sanctuary — and, my god, if that 
isn’t the sweetest gift anyone 
could give.

than 
females. 
Of 

the total undergraduate students 
enrolled as of last fall, 3,307 were 
white, 1,002 were Asian, 296 were 
Hispanic and only 138 were Black, 
according to the Office of the 
Registrar Ethnicity Report.

“In a lot of ways, ethnic diversity 

is a bigger problem than gender 
diversity,” Fedewa said.

In 
an 
already 
white-male-

dominated field — despite the 
increase of Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Math programs 
geared 
toward 
females 
and 

minorities — the question is 
raised as to what exactly these 
figures mean for the College of 
Engineering.

Faculty and Staff

Faculty and staff positions at 

the University as a whole have 
traditionally been male-dominated. 
According 
to 
the 
Faculty 

Headcount report as of March 30, 
2016, of total professor positions, 73 
percent were held by males and 27 
percent were held by females. Only 
20 percent were held by minorities.

Though more associate professor 

positions were given to females and 
minorities — with 63 percent being 
held by males, 37 percent held by 
females and 30 percent being held 
by minorities — this information 
sheds light on an obvious gap.

Seventy-five 
percent 
of 
all 

faculty and staff at the Ann Arbor 
campus as of November 2015 were 
white, according to the University 
Human Capital Reporting Tool 
Demographic Trends — a slight 
decrease from 76.6 percent in 2011. 
The report also indicated 54.7 
percent of all faculty and staff were 
male, with 45.3 percent female. 
This, too, was more balanced with 
gender representation than in 2011.

Noemi Mirkin — a faculty 

adviser for the University chapter 
of the Association for Women 
in Science who has been at the 
University for over 30 years — said 
she has experienced sexism in the 
past, particularly as a physicist, 
but she added that she’s seen an 
improvement in recent years.

“There’s 
this 
feeling 
that’s 

called subtle sexism, and what 
it is is it’s a form of exclusion: 
collegial exclusion,” Mirkin said. 
“Women are made to feel invisible 
or unimportant, either through 
physical, social or professional 
isolation. I did feel that in many 
instances where you’re not taken 
seriously or whatever, I would say, 
if a man said it, it was OK. If I said 
it, it was like I was invisible. I think 

that that has changed. It mostly has 
changed because there are more 
women — even though we haven’t 
reached a critical mass in some 
places, there are more women — 
and so it’s a lot harder to discard 
them.”

While 
the 
University 
has 

been making efforts to improve 
the campus climate, there is 
room 
for 
improvement 
with 

the 
consideration 
of 
females 

and 
minorities, 
especially 
in 

collaboration 
with 
University 

President Mark Schlissel’s new 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Plan. 
Efforts 
have 
included 

increasing student discussion and 
the creation of a strategic plan.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

According to the Office of 

the Registrar Total Enrollment 
Overview, only 4.82 percent of 
incoming freshman in fall 2015 
were Black — a number that has 
remained fairly consistent in recent 
years. Last September, Schlissel 
formally 
launched 
a 
planning 

process 
to 
improve 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion on campus. 
The DEI campaign comes in wake 
of requests for an increase in Black 
student 
enrollment 
following 

the#BBUM campaign, an initiative 
started by the Black Student Union 
in 2013 to draw attention to issues 
of race and diversity on campus.

“Dedication 
to 
academic 

excellence for the public good is 
inseparable from our commitment 
to diversity, equity and inclusion,” 
Schlissel said at the diversity 
summit held September 9, which 
aimed to create dialogue about 
creating a more inclusive campus. 
“We cannot be excellent without 
being diverse in the broadest sense 
of that word.”

At 
the 
summit, 
Schlissel 

highlighted 
the 
importance 

of enhancing diversity, which, 
according 
to 
him, 
depends 

on 
collaboration 
between 
the 

University administration and each 
department on campus.

Robert Scott, director of the 

University’s Center for Engineering 
Diversity and Outreach, said each 
college within the University has 
its own unique plan to increase 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
through a series of programs, 
recruitment 
methods 
and 

strategies aimed at improving the 
racial climate on campus.

“(Diversity) 
goes 
beyond 

ethnicity and gender to also sexual 
orientation, 
able-bodiedness, 

personality, socioeconomic status, 
international status, et cetera,”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

the reason for the tuition increase.

Regent Denise Ilitch (D) called 

out state officials for this lack of 
prioritization of higher education, 
pointing to how funding on an 
individual basis for prisoners is 
higher than that of students within 
the state.

“The state of Michigan spends 

roughly 25 percent more on prisons 
than on education,” she said. “The 
state of Michigan spends roughly 
$34,000 per prisoner and $11,000 per 
student. I first would like to use my 
public responsibilities to encourage 
Michigan citizens to think about 
the disinvestment our state, our 
governor and our legislature have 
made with respect to the budget in 
not prioritizing education.”

State Rep. Adam Zemke (D–Ann 

Arbor) echoed this sentiment in an 
interview with the Daily, saying 
there has been no increase in the 
importance of higher education in 
his time working for the legislature.

“The increases that have been 

happening are really insignificant,” 
he said. “That is to say the emphasis 
on higher education as a priority in 
my time has not really changed. An 
increase at the rate of inflation is not 
really an increase.”

Despite the clear downward trend 

in state higher education funding, 
the University’s total revenue from 
state funding has decreased by only 
$55 million since 2003, compared to 
an $802 million increase in revenue 
from tuition.

Paul Courant, former University 

provost and current professor of 
economics, said it is important to 
look at how funding has changed on 
a larger timescale.

“The basic problem is this: there 

was a time, and it was way more 
than 14 years ago, when the state 
appropriation was a substantial 
fraction of the University general 
fund budget,” he said. “If you look 
at it over time, there is a steady 
decline. Tuition has to replace each 
one of those declines, but there is an 
inability of the state appropriation to 
keep up with inflation, let alone to 
grow.”

Affordability

The 
University 
maintains 

that it is fully committed to 
affordability, and the latest budget 
includes a 10.8 percent increase in 
undergraduate financial aid, which 
is the ninth double-digit increase 
in undergraduate aid in the past 10 
years. However, total funding for 
financial aid across the University 
has increased by only $120.14 
million since 2003.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail 
interview with the Daily that 
the University aims to meet all 
demonstrated need for in-state 
students.

“No other state university has put 

as much emphasis on financial aid 
as U-M,” he wrote. “We continue 
to be the only state university that 
meets 100 percent of demonstrated 
financial need for in-state students.”

In his remarks to the board last 

Thursday, David Schafer, Central 
Student 
Government 
president, 

called for more student input on 
these decisions, as students are the 
ones impacted by changes in tuition.

“I have yet to hear of any 

structured student input on these 
decisions,” he said. “Frankly, I don’t 
get that. It makes little sense to me. 
We are the ones these decisions 
impact. We are the ones who bear 
the burden of balancing school 
while having to find an additionally 
paid work on the side … This is our 
future we are talking about. This is 
our education.”

Academic Excellence

Despite 
the 
University’s 

commitment to affordability, the 
general fund has still increased by 
approximately $802 million since 
2003 from tuition revenue alone — 
when discounting changes in state 
funding,

Fitzgerald wrote that, while 

much of the increase in general fund 
revenue stems from the increase in 
tuition, a portion of the increase in 
the general fund is accounted for 
by an increase in the proportion of 
out-of-state students, inflation and 
investments aimed at improving the 
University.

“Much of the revenue increase 

comes from the rate increase, 
but there also will be an increase 
in the total number of students, 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate,” 

he wrote. “And we anticipate 
an incremental increase in the 
proportion out-of-state students 
based on the rate of acceptances 
we’ve had from those students. The 
cost of running the University rises 
each year in part from inflation 
and in part from new initiatives 
and investments in technology 
and all the things that make U-M 
a world-class university.”

At Thursday’s regents meeting, 

Shauna Ryder Diggs (D) said that 
for the University to continue to 
improve, increasing the general 
fund is necessary, a view shared by 
Regent Laurence Deitch (D).

“Divestment is not going to lead 

us anywhere; that is not going to 
lead us to the future that we need,” 
Diggs said. “And in order to do that 
we need to spend the money, as 

Regent Deitch said, that will invest 
in our future.”

In an interview with the Daily, 

Schafer echoed this sentiment, 
saying there is a balance between 
affordability and quality.

“I think it’s so important to 

balance 
having 
an 
accessible 

and 
affordable 
education 
with 

maintaining the rich quality of our 
institution,” he said. “I think (the 
budget’s) attention to academic 
excellence and the high quality of 
this University, and, subsequently, 
the 
value 
of 
our 
degrees 
is 

important.”

Despite University’s highlight on 

maintaining quality, other similar 
institutions have not seen the same 
large increase in tuition revenue as 
the University.

Since 
2003, 
aggregate 
state 

funding for the University has 
decreased by 15 percent while the 
tuition revenue has increased by 135 
percent.

Ohio State University — another 

large, public research institution 
— has seen a 17 percent reduction 
in state funding between 2006 
and 
2015, 
but 
the 
institution 

maintained only a 52.8-percent 
increase in tuition revenue in the 
same timeframe. Ohio State has not 
increased tuition since 2012.

The University of California 

system saw a 15 percent cut in state 
funding between 2006 and 2013 
and experienced a 52.8 percent 
increase in tuition revenue during 
that time frame. The UC system 
also maintained a three-year freeze 
in tuition between 2011 and 2014, 
when its Board of Regents voted for 
a five percent tuition increase per 
year for the next five years.

While it is clear that the 

University has increased its general 
fund at a much faster rate than 
other 
comparable 
institutions, 

according Miles Kimball — a 

University economics professor — 
increasing the budget is essential 
to maintaining a high quality 
of education. Kimball cited the 
increasing wage premium for highly 
skilled labor as a source for the 
expanding budget, as higher salaries 
are becoming necessary to maintain 
a high-quality faculty. 

Kimball said the UC system is not 

facing fiscal challenges because it 
has not adjusted its budget to rising 
costs.

“You can always ruin your 

University, and basically the UC 
system has been going in that 
direction,” Kimball said. “It is 
actually very troubled by the kind 
of budget straightjacket that it has 
been put into.”

Courant echoed these sentiments, 

citing the so-called “cost disease 
phenomenon” in which the cost of 
highly skilled labor has increased 
rapidly while the productivity of this 
group has not changed. According to 
Courant, the University needs to pay 
higher salaries to faculty members 
to retain them and the quality of 
education they provide for students.

“The relative price of University 

activity, of University faculty in 
particular, as well as other skilled 
labor at the University, tends to rise 
relative to the economy as a whole,” 
he said.
Alternatives to Raising Tuition

According 
to 
Kimball, 
the 

University does not need to raise 
tuition to increase its revenue and 
budget size. Instead, Kimball said 
the University could systematically 
increase enrollment so that there is 
a both a larger student population 
and a higher proportion of out-of-
state students. The larger student 
body and the increase in the number 
of out-of-state students could then 
circumvent any need for tuition 
increases.

“There’s a missed opportunity 

where we could easily keep the 
tuition from going up simply by 
increasing the number of students,” 
he said. “I think that is a big missed 
opportunity, and, to the extent that, 
you miss that opportunity, you’re not 
doing an appropriate thing, because 
the appropriate thing would be to 
seize that opportunity.”

Fitzgerald 
wrote 
that 
the 

University 
does 
anticipate 
an 

incremental increase in the number 
of out-of-state students; however, 
while enrollment numbers have 
fluctuated in the past 15 years, the 
proportion of in-state students has 
remained consistently higher than 
that of out-of-state students.

The incoming fall 2015 freshmen 

class had 6,071 total students, 
57 percent of which came from 
in-state and 43 percent out-of-state, 
compared to fall 2000, which saw 
5,418 total students, with 58 percent 
in-state and 42 percent out-of-state.

“You’re going to have to increase 

the budget,” Kimball said. “But 
increasing the budget doesn’t mean 
that you have to increase tuition.”

According to Courant, to prevent 

rising tuition, faculty salaries would 
have to rise at a much slower pace 
across the board. However, Courant 
said this could lead professors who 
chose careers in academia to elect 
different professions, which could 
decrease the quality of University 
faculty. 

“You could imagine a world 

in which faculty salaries rose 
more slowly and there was less 
competition 
among 
universities 

for faculty,” he said. “And in that 
world the rate of growth of tuition 
necessary to cover the cost of 
the University would be lower. 
However, it might also be the case in 
that world that some of the faculty 
that are essential to the quality of 
the place now would choose to go 
into other lines of work.”

After season-ending injury, 
Glasgow ready to make return

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Ryan Glasgow remembers the 

exact moment he tore his pectoral 
muscle.

The fifth-year senior defensive 

tackle was chasing down Rutgers 
quarterback Chris Laviano when 
his hand got stuck in Laviano’s 
helmet.

The quarterback went one way, 

Glasgow went the other and he 
heard a pop. He knew instantly 
his season was over, and his 
absence from the starting lineup 
clearly had a negative effect on 
the Michigan defense.

Up until that point, the most 

rushing 
yards 

the Wolverines 
had given up 
all 
year 
was 

144. But in the 
game following 
Glasgow’s 
injury, 
Michigan gave 
up 307 rushing yards to Indiana 
before getting gouged by Ohio 
State’s rushing attack two weeks 
later for 369 yards in the final 
game of the regular season.

Fast forward seven months 

and Glasgow is raring to go with 
his shoulder almost back to 100 
percent.

“(My) strength is back already, 

which I’m really happy with 
(considering) it’s only been seven 
months,” Glasgow said Saturday. 
“Conditioning is 
fine, everything 
is 
going 
well 

right 
now. 
... 

There 
might 

be some rust in 
technique 
but 

I’d be healthy 
enough to go.”

Dealing with 

the injury was 
difficult 
for 

Glasgow as he 
had to sit on the sidelines and 
watch as his team played without 
him. But he found company 

in 
former 

defensive 
end 
Mario 

Ojemudia, who 
was Glasgow’s 
roommate and 
close friend.

Ojemudia 

had sustained a 

torn achilles tendon earlier in the 
season against Maryland, keeping 
him out for the rest of the year. 
For Glasgow, that meant he had 
someone whose situation he could 
relate to.

“You work all year to play 

these games with your friends 
and teammates,” Glasgow said. 
“(When) it gets taken away from 

you instantly it makes you realize 
how great the game of football is 
when you can’t play.

“Being 
out 

on the field is 
amazing. 
I’ve 

definitely taken 
it for granted 
before 
and 
I 

never will ever 
again now. The 
injury definitely 
sobers you up 
to the fact that 
football 
does 

have 
an 
end 

date, which is unfortunate, but 
really makes you appreciate the 
game.”

Now, Glasgow is ready to hit the 

field with the rest of the defensive 
line — a defensive line that returns 
six key contributors and also adds 
the nation’s top-ranked recruit in 
freshman Rashan Gary.

Glasgow 
is 
aware 
of 
the 

expectations 
surrounding 
the 

defensive line but believes it’s 
simply a matter of letting their 
play do the talking.

“We just want to show it on the 

field,” Glasgow said. “You don’t 
see any of us tweeting about it or 
posting on Instagram saying we 
want to be the best. Last year we 
just went out and showed it on the 
field every game, and we want to 
have a similar approach this year.”

Drevno looks for 
progress from line

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

In its final game of the 2015 

season, the Michigan football team 
faced a Florida team that boasted 
one of the top defenses in the nation.

But the Gators were no match for 

the Wolverines, who piled on 225 
rushing yards and 278 passing yards 
for a total of 503 en route to a 41-7 
victory.

All in all, it was a banner day for 

the Michigan offense. Now, offensive 
coordinator Tim Drevno looks to 
carry that momentum forward into 
the next season — especially with 
his offensive line, which is among 
the most experienced in the nation 
with a combined 105 starts.

“They’re a year older so once 

they’re comfortable with me they 
understand 
what 
I’m 

teaching 
and 

what I expect 
from 
them,” 

Drevno 
said 

Saturday 
after 
the 
A4 

quarterback 
camp. “You give 
them a little bit 
more. But really nothing’s changed 
the way I’m going to coach them. 
I’m going to demand (a lot) from 
them, and (they have to) understand 
the importance of how (good) we’ve 
got to be on the offensive line for 
the team’s success. But it is nicer 
that they’ve had a lot of games 
underneath their belt and they’ve 
played in big venues.”

The Wolverines lost only one 

starter from last year’s line in former 
center Graham Glasgow, who was 
taken in the third round of the NFL 
Draft by the Detroit Lions.

But Michigan didn’t have to look 

too far for Glasgow’s replacement 
— junior Mason Cole moved from 
left tackle, where he started all 25 
games the past two seasons and 
was awarded All-Big Ten Honorable 
Mention in 2015, to center during 
spring practice.

The move appears to have 

stuck as Drevno — who is also the 
offensive line coach — believes that 
Cole’s transition has been seamless 
thus far.

“Mason’s 
a 
very 
intelligent 

person,” Drevno said. “He’s got 

unbelievable football awareness. 
He’s done a really good job in there. 
I believe you put your best player at 
center. He’s making all the calls, and 
he’s got to be athletic and a quick 
thinker on his feet.

“(Cole’s) 
getting 
comfortable 

every day (after) doing it through 
spring ball. He’s progressing really 
nicely, (and) he’s a good football 
player.”

Sliding 
into 
Cole’s 
spot 
at 

left tackle is sophomore Grant 
Newsome, who made appearances 
in four games as a true freshman.

“Grant Newsome (has) done a 

nice job,” Drevno said. “We felt in 
the middle of (last) year that he 
could (come in and) do it, and we feel 
good about his progress right now.

“One thing with young offensive 

linemen is just the strength of their 

body. He’s done 
a good job of 
(improving) that 
this 
offseason. 

Like 
with 

anyone, 
there’s 

a 
progression 

with 
those 

young offensive 
linemen, 
so 

we give him a 

different ‘medicine prescription’, 
just (what) we felt (could) help him 
progress.”

Though Drevno says the starting 

line is currently set with Newsome 
at left tackle and the four returning 
starters — Cole and fifth-year 
seniors Erik Magnuson, Ben Braden 
and Kyle Kalis — he didn’t rule out 
the possibility of any of Michigan’s 
three incoming freshman offensive 
lineman earning playing time.

“I see Michael Onwenu as a 

guard, I see Ben Bredeson as a guard 
or center (and) Stephen (Spanellis) is 
probably a right tackle to start off,” 
Drevno said. “All of them have a 
skillset and characteristic you look 
for, and that’s why they’re here at 
MIchigan. We’re excited to get them 
on campus. It’ll be like a New Year’s 
Day and when training camp starts 
it’ll be like Christmas Day.

“All three of those guys, they’re 

going to have the opportunity to 
come in here and compete for a 
starting job. Everyday you want to 
come out and be the best, and those 
other guys in the room understand 
that.”

Beilein talks transfers, scheduling

Michigan’s non-

conference schedule 
is complete for the 
2016-2017 season

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

It has been an offseason rife 

with change for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

Assistant 
coaches 
Lavall 

Jordan and Bacari Alexander left 
to take the head 
coaching 
jobs 

at 
Wisconsin-

Milwaukee 
and 
Detroit, 

respectively, 
while 
forwards 
Kam 

Chatman 
and 

Ricky 
Doyle, 

swingman 
Aubrey Dawkins 
and 
guard 

Spike Albrecht all transferred 
elsewhere.

Head 
coach 
John 
Beilein 

opted to replace Jordan and 
Alexander on the bench with 
Saadi Washington, formerly an 
assistant coach for Oakland, and 
Billy Donlon, formerly the head 
coach of Wright State.

The Wolverines have two 

open 
scholarships 
after 
the 

flurry of departures, and Beilein 
is still looking to fill both spots 
for the upcoming 2016-17 season 
with graduate or undergraduate 
transfers.

“We’ll 
always 
be 
looking 

for any option that is a great 
Michigan 
fit,” 
Beilein 
said 

Saturday after speaking at the 
A4 quarterback camp. “If they 
were the right position, the 
right player (and) the right fit, 
we could use them. There’s kids 
still that are announcing their 
transfers right now. It’s part of 
the game and we’ve got to face 

it.”

But 
while 

additional 
changes to the 
roster may still 
take place over 
the 
coming 

months, 
Beilein 
is 

adamant that 
Michigan’s 
schedule 
is 

set, 
saying 

Saturday that one major addition 
to the non-conference schedule 
is close to being finalized.

The 
Wolverines’ 
non-

conference schedule currently 
has them slated to play Virginia 
Tech at home in the Big Ten/
ACC 
Challenge, 
Cincinnati 

and UCLA on the road and two 
games at the 2K Sports Classic 
in New York.

“Our schedule is complete,” 

Beilein 
said. 
“We 
have 

agreements for every game, 
(and) we’ve got some really 
attractive games, I think.”

‘M’ lands Matthews

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

After losing four players as 

transfers 
this 
offseason, 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
finally has some movement in the 
other direction.

According 
to 
ESPN’s 
Jeff 

Goodman 
on 

Monday 
night, 

former Kentucky 
guard 
Charles 

Matthews 
— 

who 
received 

his release from 
coach 
John 

Calipari in May 
— will transfer 
to 
Michigan. 

Matthews 
will 

sit out the 2016-
17 season per NCAA transfer 
rules and will have three years of 
eligibility remaining.

The 
announcement 
comes 

just over a week after Matthews 
reportedly 
visited 
Ann 
Arbor 

the weekend of June 11, per CBS 
Sports. A number of other schools 
were rumored to be interested 
in the former Wildcat, including 
Xavier, which hosted Matthews on 

a visit this past weekend.

A 
6-foot-6 
shooting 
guard 

who was a top-50 recruit in 2015, 
Matthews should join incoming 
freshman guard Ibi Watson in 
providing depth for the Wolverines 
at the ‘2’ and ‘3’ positions in the 
future. After losing Caris LeVert 
to graduation and Aubrey Dawkins 

as a transfer 
to 
Central 

Florida, 
Michigan was 
in dire need of 
capable bodies 
to put behind 
its 
returning 

starters, 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman and 

redshirt junior guard Duncan 
Robinson.

Matthews 
appeared 
in 
all 

36 games as a freshman for the 
Wildcats last season, making three 
starts, but fellow freshmen Isaiah 
Briscoe and Jamal Murray took the 
bulk of the playing time. As a result, 
Matthews averaged just 1.7 points 
and 1.6 rebounds in 10.3 minutes 
per game.

Matthews joins 
Ibi Watson in 

providing depth 

for Michigan.

Michigan coach John Beilein has had to hire two new assistant coaches this offseason.

looking for any 
option that is a 
Michigan fit.”

Inside Jim Harbaugh’s camp

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

If you were to walk by Al Glick 

Field House or any of its outdoor 
fields Saturday afternoon, there’s a 
good chance you wouldn’t have had 
any idea what was going on.

There 
were 
moments 
when 

dozens of high school football players 
were 
running 
around 
shirtless 

playing soccer. There were moments 
when rubber balls flew through the 
air as they played dodgeball.

And there was even a moment 

when Chicago Bears quarterback 
Jay Cutler fielded cutoff throws 
from campers as Michigan defensive 
coordinator Don Brown hit fly and 
ground balls.

In reality, what went on Saturday 

in Ann Arbor wasn’t a multi-sport 
camp. It was a football camp, 
specifically for quarterbacks. But the 
Ann Arbor Aerial Assault camp — A4 
for short — ran according to Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh’s plan, and 
that was with a unique emphasis on 
athletic versatility combined with a 
heavy NFL presence.

In fact, Harbaugh’s own views on 

what make a good quarterback were 
influenced by a NFL legend himself 
in Super Bowl-winning coach Bill 
Walsh.

“It’s in the name of Bill Walsh,” 

Harbaugh 
said 
of 
the 
camp’s 

unorthodox 
drills. 
“Spent 
time 

with Bill Walsh before he passed 
away when I was in my first year at 
Stanford, and I happened to ask him 
one day, ‘What do you look for in a 
quarterback?’ and he said, ‘Athletic 
instincts.’ I said, ‘Explain that to me. 

What does that mean?’ and he said, 
‘It means that he’s the best athlete 
in the entire high school. It means 
that he could go make the basketball 
team, the soccer team, he can swim, 
he can field balls from centerfield, he 
can be a shortstop, probably pitches 
on the baseball team. Even if he 
didn’t play the sport, he’s a good 
enough athlete that he could go make 
the team.’

“That just always resonated to 

me, and you just want to pick some 
of that up here in the camp, see how 
they operate taking athletic reps 
wherever they are. Some youngsters 
aren’t playing multiple sports as 
much as they used to, so you’d like 
to test it. There’s a lot of athletic 
reps you can take — you can climb a 
tree, and that’s about as good of an 
athletic rep that you can get in terms 
of balance, strength, core, planning 
out what your next move is.”

So Harbaugh and his staff, 

including passing game coordinator 
and wide receivers coach Jedd 
Fisch, interspersed Saturday’s camp 
with pickup games of other sports 
in hopes of bringing out the inner 
athlete from all 240 participating 
campers.

And they did so with the help 

of numerous NFL quarterbacks 
— including Cutler, Detroit Lions 
and former Michigan quarterback 
Jake Rudock, Indianapolis Colts 
quarterback Stephen Morris and 
San Diego Chargers quarterback 
Zach Mettenberger — as well as 
numerous NFL coaches and private 
quarterback coaches such as George 
Whitfield.

The NFL presence added an air 

of professionalism to the setting — 
even when campers were engaged 
in non-football activities, they were 
urged on by the professionals. And 
when campers completed drills in 
which they actually used a football, 
the coaches studied them even more 
sharply.

In one activity, the campers 

were supposed to simulate a play-
action rollout before completing a 
20-yard pass to the sideline. With 
Mettenberger 
watching 
closely, 

highly touted 2018 quarterback 
recruit 
Artur 
Sitkowski 
began 

the drill. Sitkowski was less than 
a second into his attempt when 
Mettenberger interrupted, yelling at 
Sitkowski to come back and repeat 
the drill before showing the young 
high-schooler how it was done.

Later, while the campers ate lunch 

inside the Field House, they listened 
to 
speakers 
including 
former 

Michigan Heisman Trophy winner 
Desmond 
Howard, 
Michigan 

basketball coach John Beilein and 
Buffalo Bills president Russ Brandon.

It was all part of the plan — a 

plan that even included giving 
each camper a Wonderlic test, an 
examination used to test the mental 
acuity of NFL prospects at the NFL 
Combine.

“Maybe we aspire to be the NFL’s 

33rd team,” Harbaugh said. “We’ve 
got 30 of their players and a whole 
heck of a lot of coaches out here 
today. So it feels like it.”

That 
was 
the 
environment 

Harbaugh tried to create, though 
not completely. After all, the average 
NFL team probably doesn’t have its 
players hurl dodgeballs at each other.

Speight steps up 
summer schedule

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Looking back on it, Wilton 

Speight admits his first moment 
in the driver’s seat last season 
didn’t go as planned. Then a 
redshirt freshman, he was the 
first quarterback off the bench 
after starter Jake Rudock was 
injured against Minnesota last 
Oct. 31, but the offense sputtered 
on its first two drives with 
Speight in control of it.

On the third, though, Speight 

finally 
found 
his 
groove, 

completing two passes while the 
Wolverines marched down the 
field looking to take the lead late 
in the fourth quarter.

And on a third down at the 

Minnesota 12-yard line, Speight 
made the biggest play of his 
career, threading a pass to fifth-
year senior receiver Jehu Chesson 
for the go-ahead touchdown.

Throughout 
the 
offseason, 

Speight has made it a point 
of emphasis to build upon his 
performance against the Golden 
Gophers. 
With 
the 
starting 

quarterback job open, he battled 
against redshirt juniors John 
O’Korn and Shane Morris during 
spring practices before pulling 
ahead and taking snaps with the 
first team.

Then in the Spring Game, he 

led his team to a 14-13 victory, 
accounting for both of his team’s 
touchdowns.

But Speight hasn’t slowed down 

since. In fact, he has only worked 
harder, going out to California to 
train with private quarterback 
coach Steve Clarkson alongside 
other 
college 
quarterbacks 

including 
Clemson’s 
Deshaun 

Watson and UCLA’s Josh Rosen.

He has also continued to train 

with his team in Ann Arbor, 
organizing team workouts and 
7-on-7 competitions.

“It’s tough with the coaches 

being out with satellite camps 
and 
everything, 
but 
talking 

to coach Fisch on the phone, 
talking ball and everything with 
him helps a ton,” Speight said. 
“He’s got tests we take every 
week. Then it comes down to 
how much we can do as a team, 
player-led, myself and the other 

quarterbacks organizing 7-on-7 
(drills) and workouts. We started 
back in May, early June.”

His 
experience 
in 
the 

Minnesota game, in particular, 
has stuck with him.

“One thing going into that 

Spring Game was starting fast,” 
Speight said. “In the Minnesota 
game, I came in and was a little 
sloppy at first. That was a big 
focal point for me for the entire 
spring, and I never really got to 
the point I wanted to be until the 
Spring Game.

“That’s just what I want to 

build on going into (fall) camp. 
I want my first play to be a 
touchdown.”

Speight admits that familiarity 

with the playbook has been a key 
component of his progression.

For him, this is the first time 

since high school that he hasn’t 
had to learn a new offense 
heading into the season.

“Seven-on-seven (drills) and 

stuff seem like they’re in slow 
motion compared to when I first 
came in and first started in this 
offensive system,” Speight said. 
“It’s slowed down tremendously, 
and it’s been fun.”

And as he has blossomed on 

the field, Speight has also tried 
to lead off of it, drawing upon 
lessons learned from watching 
Rudock last year.

“I’m not really the most vocal 

guy as far as the quarterbacks that 
are always willing to break down 
the huddle and have a comment 
here and there,” Speight said. “I 
don’t really do that. I try to lead 
by example and go with the flow 
and lead by that way. As far as 
changing any other things, I still 
do all the optional workouts like 
I have been (as) a fourth string or 
second string, just trying to stay 
consistent the whole time.”

Next up for Speight this 

summer? Helping the incoming 
freshmen — most of whom are 
arriving this month — adjust to 
life in Ann Arbor.

“We’ve got a bunch of wide 

receivers coming in, and we’re 
going to make sure they get 
adjusted as quickly as possible,” 
Speight said. “Just doing our best 
to make sure they’re up to speed 
and learn the new offense.”
