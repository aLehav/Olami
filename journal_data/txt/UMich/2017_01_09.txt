A new self-driving passenger 

shuttle made its North American 
debut at the University of 
Michigan Mcity testing site 
last month in the hopes it will 
eventually be approved for 
public usage.

The 
shuttle, 
named 
the 

ARMA, is manufactured by 
the French company NAVYA 
Technologies. It made its first 
appearance in North America 
in 
Mcity, 
the 
University’s 

simulated city and testing site 
for driverless cars, according to 
a University press release. The 
shuttle, will be used to provide 
self-guided tours of the facility.

Mcity was designed and is 

operated by the University’s 
Mobility 
Transformation 

Center, which partners with 
auto manufacturers as well 
as the U.S. and Michigan 
Departments of Transportation 
to 
conduct 
research 
on 

automated 
and 
connected 

vehicles.

Using 
installed 
wireless 

connection 
channels, 

“connected” cars will be able to 
communicate with other cars 
nearby in order to maximize 
safety. Since 2013, MTC has 
already 
put 
approximately 

3,000 such cars on the streets 
of Ann Arbor, according to MTC 
Director Huei Peng.

Peng expects that getting 

A 
safe-passing 
ordinance 

went into effect in Ann Arbor 
on Saturday requiring drivers 
to maintain at least a five-
foot distance when passing 
a 
pedestrian, 
bicyclist 
or 

wheelchair-user on the road. 
The ordinance serves as a 
reminder to drivers that bikers 
are allowed on the road, and 
that they should proceed with 
caution 
when 
driving 
near 

them.

Originally passed by City 

Council 
in 
December, 
the 

ordinance supports the Ann 
Arbor 
“Walk.Bike.Drive.” 

campaign advocating for safe 
roads for all types of transport 
in the city.

If drivers fail to follow the 

new rule, they could be ticketed 
and fined $100, though whether 
the situation warrants a ticket 
will be up to police officers. 
Violations will be treated as 
civil infractions and will not go 
on drivers’ records.

City Councilmember Kirk 

Westphal 
(D–Ward 
2), 
an 

occasional 
bike 
commuter, 

called the ordinance a positive 
step forward for the city.

“I’ve 
heard 
of 
several 

occasions where novice cyclers 
have gotten spooked by close-
passing vehicles and I think 
that’s a real shame,” Westphal 
said. “I believe that this can 
begin signaling to drivers that 
we all have a right to the road.”

Residents, 
however, 
did 

not meet the ordinance with 
unanimous support. Ann Arbor 
resident Kathy Griswold feels 
the new rule is good in theory, 
but unnecessary for the city to 
formally state.

“I believe it is basically 

common sense,” Griswold said. 
“And I don’t think the city has 
the resources to educate the 
public. I definitely support the 
five-foot rule ... (but) Ann Arbor 

sometimes passes these feel-
good legislations that they then 
have no way to enforce.”

Griswold said real change 

will be accomplished when a 
unified state law is passed.

“I would like to see a state 

law passed that will deal with 
the 
consistency 
across 
the 

state,” Griswold said. “Without 
that, I think this can be kind of 
confusing.”

Ann 
Arbor 
has 
long 

been known as a city that 
accommodates 
all 
types 
of 

transportation. According to 
the city’s website, Ann Arbor 
received a silver-level bicycle-
friendly city award from the 
League of American Bicyclists 
in 2013. There are 71.8 miles 
of bike lanes throughout the 
city, and since 2015, bicycle 
parking has been required to 
be included in all new building 

Ann Arbor residents ware 

head over heels for Polarity, a 
new pole fitness studio located on 
South University Avenue, which 
celebrated its grand opening by 
welcoming potential clients to 
a two-day open house this past 
weekend.

Polarity is the latest business 

venture 
by 
University 
alum 

Jessie Lipkowitz, who also owns 
the popular aUM Yoga studio 
located in the same building. The 
new studio consists of 14 poles, 
a professional sound system, a 
bathroom with full shower and a 
staff room that enables the studio 
to host catered events.

The open house welcomed 

potential 
attendees 
to 
meet 

instructors, explore the space 
and sign up for a free class 
anytime that month.

Polarity manager Stephanie 

MacDonald, who also works at 
aUM Yoga and is a University 
alum, was recently introduced to 
pole-fitness through Polarity and 
offered advice to potential clients 
by sharing her own experience.

National Council of Negro Women, students and experts host speak-out event

More than 100 people gathered 

in the auditorium of University of 
Michigan Museum of Art Friday 
night to attend the third-annual 
“HIV Monologues,” an event 
which held the goal of increasing 

awareness and defeat stigmas 
surrounding HIV/AIDS through 
the presentation of poetry and 
personal testimony.

At the beginning of the event 

— which was presented by the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
the 

National Council of Negro Women 
— LSA senior Shannon Palmer, 
vice president of NCNW, shared 

why spreading knowledge about 
HIV was important to NCNW and 
relevant in present day.

“We really brought it (HIV 

Monologues) to campus to bring 
awareness to HIV epidemic and 
to educate our fellow students 
on campus,” Palmer said. “We 
acknowledge the fact that HIV 
does 
disproportionately 
affect 

all people, but especially African 
Americans.”

The 
event 
featured 
seven 

poetry performances on HIV

LSA 
juniors 
Emma 

McGlashen 
and 
Sophia 

Kaufman 
are 
working 
on 

a play for the bicentennial 
celebration that will follow the 
trials and tribulations faced by 
the first five women to attend 
the University of Michigan.

“The 
Dangerous 

Experiment” will debut in 
East Quad’s Keane Theatre on 
Feb. 10 at 8 p.m. and run until 
Feb. 12. The play will depict 
the stories of five women who 
came to the University in 1871, 
and were a part of the first 
co-ed graduating class in 1876.

Kaufman, also a Daily arts 

reporter, explained how the 
title of the play stems from 

real events occurring at the 
University.

“The title is a direct quote 

from a meeting in which leaders 
of 
the 
University 
debated 

whether to admit women into 
the 
University,” 
Kaufman 

said. “The play follows five 
women ... all based on real 
women, 
including 
Madelon 

Stockwell, Amanda Sanford, 
Alice Freeman Palmer, Annie 

Smith Peck, Julia Knight 
Edwards and Olive San Louie 
Anderson.”

The 
play 
was 
commissioned 

by the Residential College 
as a part of the University’s 
bicentennial 
celebration 

where LSA will dedicate 
its winter and fall 2017 
semesters to exploring the 
impact of the University 
on the world throughout 
history. Each semester will 
include a variety of programs 
for students, administration 
and the public that examines 
the University’s legacy from 
a variety of perspectives.

Both 
McGlashen 
and 

Kaufman have backgrounds 
in theater at the University 
and 
worked 
together 
on 

Shakespeare in the Arb this 
past summer. The pair are 
also working closely with 
LSA Drama Prof. Katherine 
Mendeloff, a lecturer in the 
Residential College, who is 
producing the play and has 
been the artistic director of 
Shakespeare in the Arb since 
its creation in 2001.

Mendeloff, 
who 
has 

directed a variety of plays 
for the Residential College, 
said the upcoming play is 
notable because it is based 
off primary sources as well 
as part of the University’s 
bicentennial celebration.

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

Jim Harbaugh, the University 

of Michigan football coach, scored 

one last time with the outgoing 

Obama administration on Friday.

First Lady Michelle Obama 

applauded Harbaugh in her last 

speech in the White House, a 

presentation of the 2017 School 

Counselor of the Year Award. 

Obama mentioned Harbaugh and 

his wife in the introduction of 

her speech for his charity work in 

promoting higher education since 

2015, according to the Detroit Free 

Press.

“I also want to acknowledge a 

few other special guests we have 

in the audience,” Obama said in 

her last official speech as first lady. 

“We’ve got a pretty awesome crew. 

As one of my staff said, ‘You roll 

pretty deep.’ I’m like, well, yeah, 

we have a few good friends … (such 

as) Coach Jim Harbaugh and his 

beautiful wife, who’s a lot better-

looking than him.”

Obama also thanked the many 

notable guests in attendance along 

with the Harbaughs, including 

singer Usher, actress Connie 

Britton and actor Jay Pharoah, 

for using their status to motivate 

America’s young people to pursue 

higher education.

“All these folks are here 

because they’re using their star 

power to inspire our young 

people,” Obama said in her farewell 

address. “And I’m so grateful to all 

of you for stepping up in so many 

ways on so many occasions.”

Harbaugh has previously 

worked with the first lady on her 

Reach Higher initiative to promote 

higher education. In May 2015, 

he spoke with Michelle Obama at 

Wayne State University as part of a 

college signing day event for more 

than 2,000 college-bound Detroit 

high school students.

“(Going to college) is one of the 

best decisions you will ever make, 

not only for yourself and your 

future, but also for your family and 

generations to come,” Harbaugh 

said at the 2015 event. “It is so 

important that we celebrate all 

students admitted to college, not 

just athletes.”

Harbaugh also got some time 

during the event to bond with 

Usher.

who had HIV/AIDS and never 
told their mother.

“Why didn’t he show her any 

respect, because AIDS soon took 
her life,” read their poem.

Rackham 
student 
Will 

Beischel said in an interview he 
attended the event because the 
topic is personally relevant.

“I think a lot of the time HIV is 

kind of reduced to people getting 
it from being promiscuous or 
drug use and things like that 
which, you know, HIV is a 
much more varied story than 
that,” Beischel said. “A lot of the 
stories presented tonight were 
about love, and relationship and 
violation of those things, so I 
think it’s really important to 
hear all of those perspectives.”

The poems presented focused 

on different aspects of living 
with and contracting the disease, 
including growing up with AIDS 
and how actions with someone 
one night can create feelings that 
affect the rest of one’s life with 
the contraction of HIV/AIDS.

“I am writing this to you today 

so you can share with others, tell 
people that getting laid, is not 
the same as a lover,” read a poem 
presented by LSA senior Javon 
Shell.

After 
the 
poetry 

performances, 
Leseliey 
Rose 

Welch, deputy director of the 
Detroit 
Health 
Department, 

spoke. 
Welch 
began 
by 

discussing her research in South 
Africa regarding pediatric HIV, 
and touched on some of the 
reasons why this problem exists 
and what the world community 
can do to in order to combat the 
spread of the disease.

“I had been on that job (in 

South Africa) for less than two 
weeks before I had gone and 
come back to find the baby 
that I saw the day before not 
there,” Welch said. “And one 
moment crystallized in my 
mind forever … watching this 
mother cry over her baby’s 
crib. And realizing that that 
mother was crying not because 
the medicines to save her baby 
didn’t exist, but because she 
had no access to them.”

The 
symptoms 
of 
this 

problem had several causes in 

South Africa, Welch said.

“They 
weren’t 
missing 

awesome doctors in South Africa 
in 1998; they were missing the 
power, the money, the resources, 
and politics was preventing 
saving lives,” Welch said. “It’s 
not HIV, it’s the world. What 
that really means is that we are 
our own problem at this point.”

Welch’s 
presentation 

examined the problem of HIV/
AIDS in the United States and 
why we still have a problem 
with HIV/AIDS.

“We are here because of 

a false hierarchy of human 
value,” 
Welch 
said. 
“That 

really is at the crux and the 
root of every ‘-ism’ we know 
how to describe. This idea that 

my life is more valuable than 
yours, or yours more valuable 
than mine.”

Welch 
included 
possible 

strategies 
to 
mitigate 
the 

effects 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
and 

suggested that no one concrete 
solution will be the end-all to 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

“I think the only thing 

that will get us there is love, 
and love in a social, political 
sense,” Welch said. “Love from 
the top down and to our core 
and a love that transcends the 
differences that we see and 
don’t see.”

Welch ended her speech by 

reading two poems, the first 
of which discussed the pain of 
knowing one has HIV and the 
second centered on the topic 
of activism along with the 
refusal of “-isms.”

Business 
junior 
Arjun 

Kaushal found value in the 
topic being presented in this 
manner, 
which 
worked 
to 

create a broader awareness.

“People oftentimes think 

that 
HIV/AIDS 
isn’t 
here 

because they’re not seeing it,” 
Kaushal said “when in fact it’s 
here, and it’s on our campus.”

SPEAKOUT
From Page 1A

the ARMA on public roads will 
present more of a challenge, 
however.

“I think one of the key 

challenges 
of 
driverless 

vehicles is, first of all, they 
need to be street-legal, and the 
ARMA is a vehicle designed 
by a French company, NAVYA, 
and they’re not necessarily 
street-legal 
in 
the 
United 

States,” 
he 
said. 
“And 
in 

addition to our additional rules 
that driverless vehicles must 
follow, when they are trying 
to provide mobility services to 
the general public, there are 
additional 
qualifications. 
So 

at this moment, the NAVYA 
vehicles cannot yet be operated 
on a public road in the city, but 
that’s one thing we are trying to 
achieve.”

However, rather than playing 

a technological role, MTC is 
simply assisting NAVYA with 
the 
logistics 
and 
eventual 

implementation of putting their 
self-driving shuttle on public 

roads, Peng said.

“Our role is not necessarily 

technology,” he said. “We are not 
helping them to develop, NAVYA, 
we are just trying to link them 
to the data they use. Again, the 
goal is to deploy this vehicle on 
the streets of Ann Arbor and 

understand how it can be part 
of the public transportation 
system in the city.”

NAVYA 
is 
hoping 
their 

driverless vehicles will make a 
splash elsewhere in the United 
States as well, according to 
MTC Communications Director 
Susan Carney.

“The vehicle was introduced 

at Mcity only on December 9,” 
Carney wrote in an email. “It was 
shipped to Las Vegas not long after 
to be used for demonstrations

Electronics Show).”

When they do end up being 

put into street usage, however, 
Peng imagines that they could 
help to modify bus routes at the 
University to make them more 
efficient.

“Sometimes, at the end of 

the bus route, in many cases 
the bus is pretty empty,” he 
said. “In other words, redesign 
and shorten the bus route and 
replace part of the route with 
shuttles.”

Because the shuttles only 

seat 15, though, Peng thinks the 
current buses are here to stay.

“Our University bus system 

serves about 36,000 trips per 
day, so there are many cases 
when the bus is pretty full, and 
we don’t believe that replacing 
one 
bus 
with 
three 
other 

shuttles makes any sense,” Peng 
said. “I don’t think it makes 
sense to be replacing the buses 
with shuttles, but it needs to be 
integrated.”

so bad that I was so determined 
to come back and get better,” 
MacDonald 
said. 
“By 
the 

second class I was so much 
more comfortable and much 
less fearful.”

She assured beginners that 

they would be welcomed and 
comfortable 
despite 
having 

little experience.

“A lot of people are signing 

up with friends, which I think 
is great because it takes away 
a lot of fear and nervousness,” 
MacDonald said. “We have so 
many different classes on the 
schedule and instructors that 
are so welcoming that you don’t 
feel intimidated at all. Students 
will definitely feel right at 
home.”

Lipkowitz opened Polarity 

with the goal of removing the 
negative stigma surrounding 
pole fitness. She strives to 
create 
an 
accessible 
studio 

with a welcoming atmosphere 
that will make students feel 
comfortable exploring pole as 
both a fitness and mental health 
building activity. She added 
that Polarity is also the new 
official home of the Michigan 

Pole Dance Society, a student 
organization on campus.

“My 
whole 
goal 
is 
to 

demystify pole in the same 
way that I demystified yoga,” 
Lipkowitz said. “We’re starting 
out with a very beginner-
friendly curriculum and are 
hoping to grow with our clients. 
As soon as we see that we’re 
experiencing growth and that 
people are coming back, we’ll 
add classes to the schedule 
accordingly.”

Instructors 
Sylvia 
Chen 

and 
Laura 
Marthey 
gave 

demonstrations and answered 
questions 
during 
the 
open 

house. Marthey agreed with 
Lipkowitz 
that 
beginners 

shouldn’t be afraid to come to 
the studio.

“The focus of the studio is 

from a fitness and wellness 
perspective and to demystify 
and desexualize pole,” she said.

As a new studio, Chen says 

Polarity 
anticipates 
most 

clients to be beginners, so all 
of the classes are designed to 
be beginner friendly, with the 
intention of expanding in the 
future.

Polarity offers several classes 

including Polega, Power Pole, 
Pole Technique, Contemporary 
Dance Pole and Beginner Pole. 
Polega in particular mixes aUM 
Yoga’s popular class F*** This is 
Hard with pole-fitness in order 
to improve balance, flexibility, 
strength 
and 
endurance, 

according to Lipkowitz.

Lacroix

of 
many 

University 
students 
who 

attended 
the 
Polarity 
open

free class in January and was 
excited to try pole.

“The 
studio 
was 
really 

nice and everyone was very 
friendly,” Lacroix said. “I’m 
nervous but excited to give it a 
try and see if I like it.”

Business sophomore Mohammad 

Shaikh is an avid biker. In the warmer 
weather, he usually rides his bike 
around campus every day, and as an 
Ann Arbor native, he has experience 
biking throughout the rest of the city 
as well. Shaikh said he supports the 
ordinance, and thinks it will make 
Ann Arbor a safer place for bikers and 
pedestrians.

“Because Ann Arbor is a city where 

parking is limited and a lot of people 
park on the side of the road, that kind 
of takes away space,” Shaikh said. 
“And when you add bikers into the 
equation, it’s hard to accommodate 
everyone... I haven’t had too much 
of a problem with people driving too 
close to me, but I think that we can 
definitely be safer.”

looking for individuals living 
with chronic illnesses to talk 
about what they perceived as 
their 
greatest 
management 

struggle. Wolin responded to 
Soraya’s post.

“I personally live with Type 

1 diabetes and celiac disease,” 
Wolin said. “I’m pretty much an 
open book and I wanted to see 
what she was interested in.”

Soraya reached out later to 

Wolin and informed her of an 
annual competition sponsored 
by the Public Health School 
called Innovation in Action, 
which 
encourages 
Michigan 

students to create projects to 
address real-world problems.

After 
graduating 
from 

Michigan 
in 
April, 
Wolin 

submitted 
the 
project 
for 

the 
Lyfebulb-Novo 
Nordisk 

Innovation Award, which strives 
to award patient entrepreneurs 
that have created projects that 
advance the care of diabetes.

Lyfebulb 
founder 
Karin 

Hehenberger, 
the 
award’s 

creator, commended Wolin for 
her simple idea that appealed to 
many patients.

“Four 
individuals 
picked 

Brianna (Wolin), the youngest 
person, a spunky girl — it was 
incredible,” she said.

The 
award 
attracted 

applications from more than 
100 people from 15 different 
countries. 
Ten 
applicants, 

including Wolin, were chosen to 
attend the Innovation Summit 
hosted by Novo Nordisk in 
Copenhagen. At the conference, 
the applicants first pitched their 
ideas to entrepreneurs, then to a 
patient panel, which ultimately 
picked Wolin as the winner.

“Winning the award really 

meant that I took a circumstance 
given to me without an option 
and that I was able to turn it 
around into something that 
is impactful to others,” Wolin 
said. “People are finally taking 
a moment to realize the mental 
health 
impact 
of 
chronic 

illness.”

For Wolin, winning the award 

highlighted 
the 
importance 

of FYD for individuals with 
chronic illness. When Soraya 
graduates from the University 

with her master’s, Wolin is 
hopeful that the project can 
continue to be impactful. In the 
meantime, Wolin will continue 
to work on launching the 
project. 

“My work on FYD grew 

out of absolute need that I felt 
going to a university where it’s 
easy sometimes to feel alone,” 
she said. “You need to leverage 
what’s available until the next 
thing comes around. I promise 
to bring Find Your Ditto as soon 
as possible.”

LSA freshman Sari Grossman 

currently lives with Crohn’s 
disease. Grossman joined the 
Crohn’s and Colitis Student 
Initiative at the beginning of her 
freshman year, and affirmed the 
need to have connections with 
people with similar experiences.

“I have been able to meet 

people 
who 
had 
similar 

experiences, 
but 
also 
very 

different 
ones 
from 
me, 

Grossman said. “(FYD) would 
be really beneficial for a lot of 
people that are in the club on 
campus, or this is their first 
time talking about their illness. 
It will be a really great first step 
for people.”

My whole goal is 
to demystify pole 
in the same way 
that I demystified 

yoga

for the 200th anniversary 
of U of M, and is developed 
from 
primary 
sources,” 

Mendeloff 
said. 
“Several 

storylines were taken from a 
novel written by one of the 
first co-ed graduates, Olive 
San Louie Anderson, who 
wrote about her experiences 
at the college as a member of 
that first group of women.”

The 
directors 
noted 

how the message of the 
play resonated with them, 
especially 
because 
the 

inequalities women faced 
in 1871 have not vanished 
completely. 
They 
said 

the 
main 
characters 
of 

the play struggle to be 
taken seriously by both 

the 
administration 
and 

their male peers, and cast 
members used this struggle 
as a talking point to discuss 
the lives of older relatives 
who faced similar issues in 
school.

Furthermore, McGlashen 

noted one of the main goals 
behind 
“The 
Dangerous 

Experiment” 
was 
to 

bring history and notable 
historical figures to life, 
through 
a 
fictionalized 

account of the very real 
pressure they faced from the 
community and University.

“One 
of 
the 
main 

objectives of our project is 
to humanize the history,” 
McGlashen 
said. 
“To 

enforce the fact that these 
historical 
retrospectives 

that the University is doing 
for the bicentennial are 

based on living, breathing 
people 
who 
experienced 

many of the same joys and 
frustrations that students 
and 
faculty 
experience 

today.”

Both Mendeloff and the 

play’s directors said the 
play is a good fit for both 
the Residential College and 
the bicentennial celebration 
because of its basis in 
history and relevance to 
current 
issues 
faced 
by 

female students.

“I 
think 
that 
‘The 

Dangerous 
Experiment’ 

perfectly represents how 
the bicentennial is not only 
an opportunity to look back 
and see how far we’ve come, 
but to think about how we 
can push ourselves now 
even further in the pursuit 
of equality,” Kaufman said.

E

ngineering 
education, 

as I have experienced it, 
has a singular obsession 

with theory. This obsession 
brings 
irreparable 
change 

to a student’s mentality and, 
inevitably, the industry they 
enter. I make the presumption 
throughout this column that 
engineering 
students 
enter 

college with a desire to create 
or change things for the better 
in some way. This fundamental 
desire is not catered to when 
students enter the classroom; 
it is even discouraged. This 
is not to say that all ability 
to 
achieve 
great 
things 
is 

completely limited by years of 
classroom experience. The point 
is to highlight how engineering 
education falls short of the 
inspiring experience it could be.

A staunch focus on theory 

without an application element 
divorces theory and application. 
If the purpose of coming to 
school is to ultimately create or 
change one’s environment, from 
the beginning, school and the 
purpose have been separated. 
The mentality is then created 
and widely accepted that the 
classroom is for learning theory, 
and external projects, teams 
or jobs exist for learning the 
application of those theories.

This likely sounds acceptable 

at first, but invaluable first-
hand experience that would 
solidify and bring meaning 
to the theory in one’s mind at 
the time of learning is lost. 
Learning in the classroom 
is vitally important, but its 
own singular focus on theory 
prevents 
it 
from 
getting 

through to students and giving 
them the information they 
need to succeed.

I, and surely many others, 

feel as though they are trudging 
through the school portion of their 

day to go work on a project team, 
personal project or something of 
the like. This mentality is awful 
for thoroughly learning material 
instead of trying to improve 
relentlessly — the student just tires 
to get through. By trying to drill 
the theory into students’ minds 
with lectures and homework 
that simply reinforce the theory, 
the opposite effect is achieved by 
misplacing students’ motivation. 
Class treats itself as a bother to 
be quickly worked through and 
brushed aside instead of a skill 
to be fleshed out and thoroughly 
learned.

Over time, treating classroom 

learning as something that must 
be gotten through simply to get 
a degree to get a job takes a toll 
on students. What was once 
seen as a real chance to change 
things for the better becomes 
something they do just to get 
by. The original passion for 
their subject of study is lost in 
the push to meet one deadline. 
The loss of passion reduces the 
quality of engineering work 
put out into society and, as a 
result, the main objective of 
learning in the classroom has, 
instead of improving society, 
done it a disservice. Obviously, 
the loss of passion does not 
occur in all cases, but it does 
occur in a significant number. 
Many people I know, including 
myself, have fallen victim to 
this effect and it is simply 
depressing 
to 
watch 
such 

potential be squandered.

In a more ideal system, 

colleges 
would 
remove 

the 
current 
degree 
of 

separation and marry their 
discussion 
of 
theory 
with 

first-hand 
construction 
and 

demonstration. 
Students 

would not learn the theory by 
spending unnecessary hours 
being lectured and completing 
arbitrary 
problems 
to 

demonstrate their knowledge. 
Instead, the students would 

be required to design and/
or build a single device by the 
end of college encompassing 
all knowledge attained. Design 
based on the theories covered 
in class would be the primary 
focus 
instead 
of 
constant 

problems. This should both 
engrain the ideas in students’ 
minds and show them how they 
may be used. Something like this 
already happens in introductory 
level and some higher-level 
engineering classes but gaining 
first-hand experience in only a 
small portion of classes is not 
enough to counteract the effects 
of the remainder of classes 
described above.

Obviously, reconciling this 

ideal with the current system 
would be impossible in any 
short period of time. However, 
this system where engineering 
students work on a project 
that encompasses everything 
they have learned may be 
implemented 
alongside 
the 

current system relatively easily.

The approach to this project 

could not be one similar to 
the introductory engineering 
classes where the performance 
of the project is irrelevant; this 
practically defeats the purpose 
of the project in students’ 
minds and makes it a time-
consuming 
chore. 
Instead, 

the students should use the 
concepts they have learned to 
make a well-functioning device 
of their choosing over their 
time in college. Whatever they 
have made or designed could 
also be shown to employers and 
serve as a relatively tangible 
display 
of 
design 
and/or 

construction capability. With 
this, perhaps a realignment of 
motivations will be brought 
back to engineering education 
and give the education itself 
some meaning.

F

amous novelist Thomas 
Berger once said, “The 
art and science of asking 

questions is the source of all 
knowledge.”

When we are young, we 

always ask questions; questions 
that 
sometimes 
make 
our 

parents uncomfortable because 
of the answers. As children, we 
are curious about everything, 
why the sky is blue and how we 
came to enter this world. Before 
we can talk, we use our senses 
to investigate something we 
are confused upon. As we grow 
up, we express these thoughts 
through questions. This 
is 

basic human nature.

Why is it then as we grow up 

we are conditioned to not be as 
curious as we once were; we are 
shut down by authority figures, 
parents and peers, who tell us 
to “stop being so annoying” 
and say things like “why did 
you ask that? The answer was 
obvious.”

The stigma around asking 

questions in a classroom is 
negative. From my experience 
of being a student, asking 
a question indicates a lack 
of intellectual ability. Fear 
of asking questions in large 
classroom settings discourages 
students from gaining help 
when they need it. This fear 
comes 
from 
embarrassment 

students may feel by making 
themselves vulnerable about 
not being perfect. The types 
and number of students in a 
class build an environment 
that has a direct correlation to 
how comfortable students feel 
asking questions.

If someone is not interested 

in the information they seek, 
they will not ask questions 
and cannot expand upon their 
knowledge. Furthermore, they 
cannot attain any knowledge if 
they do not first inquire about it. 
It is part of human nature to ask 
questions when confused. Then 
why is it that we shame this way 
of thinking in many classrooms?

I observed a student in my 

class last semester who was 
told by the teacher he was 
only allowed to speak twice a 
class period, because he had 
asked too many questions. 
Asking questions is a symbol 
for knowledge, but our own 
professors are putting down 
people because of their ability 
to speak their mind and ask 
thought-provoking 
questions 

about 
which 
their 
fellow 

classmates might also wonder.

It could be argued that 

teachers 
or 
persons 
of 

authority 
feel 
the 
most 

challenged by these questions, 
which then speaks to the 
depth of their knowledge of 
the subject. If a teacher cannot 
answer a question provided 
to them by the student, then 
how do they expect their 
student to learn a topic so the 
message resonates with them 
personally? 
Understanding 

something on a personal level 
will give a student the tools to 
delve into the topic and grasp a 
relationship with the material 
in a way that resonates.

Each student is different. 

The way individuals learn is 
unique to their own individual 
intellectual 
makeup 
and 

how they digest these large 
concepts in their brains.

However, 
teachers 
and 

other students may see asking 

questions as a weakness. Other 
students who see an individual 
asking a question they do not 
have find the asker slow, out of 
place and a disruption to their 
own learning. Empathy about 
what learning looks like for 
others on the part of students 
who are frustrated by it would 
benefit classroom culture and 
the students themselves. There 
is no harm in being curious; 
when curiosity ceases is when 
all learning ends.

In a world that is growing to 

be more accepting of others and 
acknowledges diversity, one 
would think teachers would 
encourage an environment of 
being curious and accepting so 
that the class as a whole could 
benefit.

Every student who attends 

this university is seeking to 
learn information beyond rote 
memorization. So why then 
do we as students discourage 
asking questions and speaking 
out when confused? The lessons 
we learn from our university 
experience help us to provoke 
our interests and apply these 
deep lessons we learn to our 
everyday life beyond schooling.

University-level learning is 

supposed to be enriching and 
fulfilling in whatever subject one 
chooses to learn. The negative 
stigma surrounding the ability 
to ask questions diminishes 
the confidence of students. It is 
kind of ironic, that at a learning 
institution, other students are 
not encouraging students to ask 
questions and therefore does not 
promote learning as it should.

I too have a question for this 

university: why?

Achieveable New Year’s resolutions

MICHAEL SUGERMAN | COLUMN

N

ew 
Year’s 
resolutions 

tend to be notoriously 
vague 
and 
breakable. 

According to Nielsen, some of 
the top resolutions 
include staying fit 
and healthy, losing 
weight, enjoying life 
to the fullest, getting 
organized 
and 

traveling more.

Well folks, I’m a 

fan of specificity, and 
in the spirit of this, 
here is a list of New 
Year’s 
resolutions 

that I hope you’ll find 
both unambiguous and feasible.

***

Wash my underwear before I 

run out of it and have to either: A. 
Go commando, or B. Order more 
via Amazon Prime. This also 
applies to socks.

Host dinner at my house once 

a month, followed by drinks 
and board games. Convening 
friends is important. So is 
competitive Scrabble.

Cancel my New York gym 

membership from the summer. 
Plan 
to 
start 
going 
to 
the 

Intramural Sports Building to 
work out — it’s a lot closer than 
Manhattan and better for hanging 
out with friends.

At long last, sell back my 

freshman (also: sophomore and 
junior) year textbooks to Ulrich’s. 
It’s only fair that Paul Krugman’s 
“Microeconomics” book has the 
opportunity to frustrate another 
innocent soul.

Apply for jobs. Get a job. Learn 

about 
401(k) 
benefits. 
Build 

my credit. Watch instructional 
YouTube videos about how to 
execute more difficult styles of tie 
knots. Update my email signature. 
Trim my nails more regularly. 
Listen to those voicemails from a 
year ago and finally delete them. 
You know — adult stuff.

Use the events.umich.edu site to 

identify cool speakers and attend 
their guest lectures. Go to at least 
two University Musical Society 
performances. Go see some a 
cappella shows, or some student 
improv. Take advantage of the 
resources our school offers.

Similarly, 
research 
events 

hosted by student organizations 

that focus on dialogue around 
issues of diversity and attend at least 
one of them. Listen. Ask questions. 
Learn. 
Make 
a 
commitment 

to 
understanding 

perspectives 
different 

from 
my 
own 
and 

encourage others to do 
the same.

Stop binge watching 

“The Office” on Netflix 
for the umpteenth time 
and forcibly re-discover 
my love for reading. 
More realistically, just 
pick a new show.

Go to sleep at a 

reasonable hour. One of my 
roommates, a nursing student, 
frequently 
reminds 
me 
the 

importance of being in touch with 
my circadian rhythm. Google 
“circadian rhythm.”

Write more for recreation (read: 

start a journal). Writing for an 
audience is great, but so is writing 
for oneself.

Explore the Ann Arbor bar 

scene in more depth than the 
notorious lineup of South U 
spots. Subsequently discover that 
there may be more to life than 
Rick’s “Mindprobes.”

Take a long weekend and road 

trip to the Upper Peninsula. I’ve 
heard wonderful things about 
Mackinac; I’ve also been told that 
it’s actually pronounced “mack-
ih-naw.” Find out if the rumors 
are true. Potentially lose myself 
in fudge.

Scour The New York Times’ 

cooking site for interesting recipes. 
Glean inspiration from one of those 
addicting Buzzfeed Tasty videos. 
Diversify dinner, even though 
I’d be content to defrost chicken 
breasts, something starchy and 
something green for all eternity. 
Take less than a week to clean up 
the pots and pans. Eh, maybe less 
than two weeks.

Finish unpacking my clothes 

from Winter Break. Fold the 
clothes from my most-recent 
laundry run and put them away 
in the right drawers. At the very 
least, throw them in the drawers. 
All right, just toss them on a 
chair — at least it’s a step in the 
right direction.

Continue regular Arb walks 

once the temperature ascends 

above 30 degrees. Plan a small 
event in the Arb’s amphitheater 
after the snow melts. Achieve 
oneness 
with 
nature 
… 
or 

something.

Buy a planner that isn’t an 

MPlanner. Use it. Wind up settling 
for Google Calendar. Use it.

Stop 
perpetuating 
2016 

fads non-ironically. New year, 
new me, less dabbing. We can 
all benefit from less dabbing 
#EndDabbing2K17. 
Stop 
using 

hashtags conversationally. Stop 
using acronyms conversationally. 
Saying “lol” is clearly not the same 
as laughing out loud.

Subscribe to at least one major 

newspaper’s daily newsletter and 
read it every morning. Choose at 
least one interesting podcast, and 
carve out time to listen to it weekly. 
Stay informed and think critically. 
Do not compromise on this.

***

Perhaps 
some 
additional 

retrospection is due.

There is no denying that 2016 

was fraught with a plethora of 
conflict. From individual struggles, 
to the ongoing campus discussions 
about all facets of identity, to 
domestic politics, to the deaths of 
pop culture icons, to international 
diplomacy, one might understand 
why so many were ready for the 
last year to end.

But know this: The New Year 

is not a reset button, and time 
is continuous. As easy as it is to 
celebrate the end of 2016, we need 
to recognize that all the problems 
that bubbled to the surface are 
just as salient in 2017 as they were 
before. Let’s also acknowledge 
that it wasn’t all bad. Appreciate 
the moments, whether there were 
many or few, that made you smile.

So above all, this year, be kind 

to one another. Have fun when 
you can. Don’t shy away from the 
hard discussions when they arise. 
Let’s be resolute in our efforts to 
be the best we can be individually 
and to make others the best they 
can be collectively.

I believe in our ability to do 

that just as much as I believe in 
my ability to wash my underwear 
more regularly. Happy New Year.

Take the common icebreaker 

question: if you were the last 
person on earth, what would 
you do? Except now consider 
that you are no longer on Earth, 
but the commercial spacecraft 
Avalon, 
travelling 
hundreds 
of 

years 
through 

space 
to 

a 
faraway 

colonial planet. 
With slick CGI 
backdrops, 
“Passengers” 
hurtles an age-
old question of 
loneliness 
and 

humanity into a 
new age.

Due to a technology hiccup, 

Jim (Chris Pratt, “Jurassic 
World”) is jolted awake from 
his hibernation pod ninety 
years before expected. With 
the rest of the five thousand 
passengers still asleep and no 
other hope of rescue, he reads 
Aurora’s (Jennifer Lawrence, 
“Joy”) 
background 
papers 

and falls in love with her and 
wakes her up. Meanwhile, 
the 
spacecraft 
continues 

malfunctioning 
and 
the 

problems eventually become 
too big to ignore.

For a movie about loneliness, 

“Passengers” 
is 
too 
self-

conscious of its own quiet. 
The 
beginning 
starts 
off 

promising: Jim’s voice echoing 
against 
deserted 
hallways, 

caustic montages of him sitting 
alone in large rooms full of 
unoccupied chairs.

Then, hearing the pause, 

it panics and sputters out 
unnecessary 
dialogue, 

bringing in robot bartender 

Arthur 
(Michael 
Sheen, 

“Masters of Sex”), who looks 
like a human and speaks like 
one, dispensing wisdom and 
serving as Jim’s emotional 
rock. Though arguably the 
most 
interesting 
character, 

his friendship interrupts the 
silence needed for the gravity 
of the situation sink in. At no 

point does it ever 
feel like Jim is 
truly alone. Pratt’s 
beard growth is 
the only indicator 
that 
a 
year 
in 

complete solitude 
has passed.

“Passengers” 

also attempts to 
untangle a bevy 
of 
philosophical 

questions: the idea 
that 
emotional 

connection 
distinguishes 

human and robot, whether 
love is fated to be, the ethics 
behind hurting another to save 
oneself.

Though 
it’s 

clear that the 
film’s intent for 
mixing 
humor 

and love with 
danger 
is 
to 

find 
moments 

of 
humanity 

in 
hopeless 

situations, 
it 

doesn’t execute 
either well. To 
pull off either a “Titanic”-
style 
doomed 
romance 
or 

an 
intellectual 
challenge 

successfully, the movie had to 
pick between one or the other. 
It doesn’t.

The 
ethical 
dilemmas 

complicate Jim and Aurora’s 
romance (if it could even be 
called that) and “Passengers” 
fails to finish answering what 
it started. It doesn’t adequately 
contextualize 
that 
their 

relationship was born out of 
loneliness 
and 
desperation, 

not chemistry. It incorrectly 
misrepresents 
Aurora’s 

forgiveness as stemming from 
love, not necessity. Portraying 
their 
relationship 
with 
a 

typical 
romance 
storyline 

brainwashes us to think Jim’s 
disturbing actions are okay.

Based 
on 
its 
marketing, 

“Passengers” 
should 
have 

succeeded as a thriller alone, 
but even the action sequences 
fell flat. It dedicates screen time 
primarily to Lawrence and Pratt’s 
relationship, only adding thrill 
in its final quarter, almost as an 
afterthought. 
Everything 
feels 

too easy and ends too quickly. The 
ship’s commander is awakened, 
for no reason other than to grant 
access to critical areas. Then, every 
problem follows a pattern of Aurora 
wailing, “what do we do?” and Jim, 
who is a mechanic, telling her the 
solution and immediately fixing 
it himself. Aurora’s only role is to 
look distressed and repeat “this 

is bad,” as if the 
flashing red lights 
and sirens weren’t 
enough to clue us 
in.

Jumping 

between 
action 
scenes, 

philosophical 
questions, 
jest 

and 
romance, 

“Passengers” 

aims 
for 
grandeur, 
trying 

to pack in love and life and 
everything 
in 
between, 

following 
the 
style 
of 
its 

obvious inspirations “Titanic” 
and “2001: A Space Odyssey”. 
But 
it 
overreaches, 
trying 

for everything and offering 
nothing. Though Jim has no 
shortage of time, the way 
“Passengers” hurriedly chokes 
each half-baked idea by the next, 
the movie acts like he does.

THEO KATZMAN

How uncomfortable does this make you feel? Submit emotions below!
Katzman perfects the 
pop song on ‘Heartbreak’

There’s 
this 
feeling, 
this 

sensation, that wells up in my 
chest when I hear a great song. 
It’s what I would like to believe 
is the purest expression of art 
affecting body and soul.

What’s beautiful about this 

is that the feeling ranges across 
genre. It could be a symphony 
or a pop song that causes this 
ballooning 
of 
emotion, 
and 

when it happens my body 
tenses, my insides turn and my 
core tightens. It’s a peculiar 
sensation of wanting to cry and 
desperately scream at the same 
time. It’s a tingling, a pressure, 
that permeates every nerve 
in the body as your mind tells 
your heart: “This is something 
spectacular, but unbearably so.”

In other words, I listened to 

Theo Katzman’s second solo 
album Heartbreak Hits. With 
each song I wanted to dance, 
shout and cry all at once. But 
I’ve maxed my limit on crying 
publicly in Espresso Royale, 
so the only other option is to 
put pen to paper instead to 
unravel the emotional wreckage 
inflicted by Heartbreak Hits. 
Because that’s what it’s about 
— upbeat or slow, heavy electric 
or light acoustic, this album 
unravels the intricacies of a 
broken heart while breaking 
the listener’s with every passing 
second.

“Hard Work,” the first song 

on 
the 
album, 

was 
released 

months 
ago 
as 

the 
premiere 

single, but time 
hasn’t diminished 
its rock ‘n’ roll 
appeal. 
When 

placed 
next 
to 

the 
other 
fast-

paced rock songs 
on Hits, it mainly 
reassures us that 
Katzman, by some 
divine 
power, 

has perfected the 
rock song. “My 
Heart is Dead,” 
“As the Romans 
Do” and “Lost and 
Found” all push this sound even 
further, and leave us with songs 
to shamelessly jam to for hours 
without any disruption in their 
power and appeal. They’re pop-
rock meets pure, unadulterated 
talent. Cringe away from that 
word and genre if you’d like, but 
when done right — as Katzman 
has here — it’s formidable.

But it’s an album about love 

and heartbreak, and despite the 
upbeat rhythms of “My Heart 
is Dead” and “Hard Work,” 
the lyrics reveal a different 
story. When layered with rock 
and encouraged by Katzman’s 
unyieldingly 
energetic 
stage 

presence, an entire audience can 
find itself screaming “there’s a 
gaping hole in the front of my 
chest” while smiling wildly at 
the feel-good vibes. The music 
lingers in the love, and the lyrics 
revel in the loss.

Coming down from the heavy 

rock is the upbeat, yet more 
acoustically centric pieces; I 
place “Break Up Together” and 
“Crappy Love Song” in this 

category. They are slow and 
sad, adjectives which inevitably 
belong together, but don’t have 
the crushing weight of songs like 
“Good to Be Alone” and “Plain 
Jane Heroin.” “Crappy Love 
Song” is reminiscent of Paul 
McCartney’s “Silly Love Song,” 
a song written in response to 
Lennon’s dismissal of Paul’s 
love, 
love, 
love. 

But it’s not in the 
same poppy vein 
as 
McCartney’s. 

It 
rests 
in 

sadness, 
while 

simultaneously 
rejecting 
it. 
He 

doesn’t want any 
more “sad, sappy 
love songs about 
two people who 
can’t get along”; he wants a happy 
one, but will settle with a crappy 
one. Still, his album is called 
Heartbreak Hits and no matter 
how heavy the rock is in some of 
its songs, many are sad and about 
love. Irony abounds.

This dynamic can be found in 

the slower songs especially. “Good 
to Be Alone” and “Plain Jane 
Heroin,” are hauntingly beautiful, 
their power only enhanced when 
placed next to the heavy rock of 
their surrounding contenders. 
They tug at the heartstrings 
and nostalgia of youthful love. 
They dig into the little details of 
loving and being loved, leaving 
no detail untouched. And to add 
to the genre-bending nature of 
Katzman’s talent, “Good to be 
Alone” is his self-proclaimed 

country 
song. 

It’s thick with 
situational 
and 

lyrical 
irony, 

yet 
horribly 

bittersweet. 
It 

recounts all the 
little details of a 
relationship that 
are lost once all 
ties are cut — 
the 
loneliness 

that 
assumes 

the 
space 

companionship 
once filled.

Empty spaces 

are a recurring 
theme 
on 
this 

album, 
and 

maybe that’s where the power, the 
emotional welling, can be located 
— in profound absence. “Plain 
Jane Heroin” exemplifies this the 
best. The final song on the album, 
“Plain Jane Heroin” begins slow, 
sincere, with Katzman on guitar, 
the notes echoing, untouched and 
floating midair. Then the drums 
come in and Joey Dosik enters 
on keys. The song builds, electric 
guitar introduced, and just as 
Katzman is forever changed, 
hooked on this metaphorical drug, 
so are we. Because that’s what 
music does. Whether it’s another 
album we can dance or cry to, or 
both, it inherently changes us. It 
introduces us to notes and stories 
that will stay with us far longer 
than our own memories do. The 
music, eventually, becomes a 
cherished memory of our own 
regard.

It’s art and its eternal struggle 

of creator versus consumer. Who 
gives it value? Who decides if it’s 
earth-shattering genius or trash? 
Who has the audacity to claim 
that a bunch of crappy love songs 

could change the world?

Not me, because crappy love 

songs have and always will be 
slowly but surely changing the 
world. They are the breakup 
songs and the songs that make 
your chest well with conflicting 
and indescribable emotion. They 
are your parents’ wedding songs 
gone sour — Ambrosia’s “Biggest 

Part of Me” with 
a twist. They are 
what remind us, 
at the end of a 
37-minute album 
or 
four 
minute 

song, 
that 
the 

world will indeed 
keep on spinning.

Sometime 

between 
Katzman’s debut 

and now, the poor man had his 
heart broken either once or 
several times. And it’s difficult 
to empathize and pity his 
broken heart when this was 
the beautiful piece he so kindly 
crafted in the wake of hardship. 
It’s hard to feel badly, when the 
music makes you feel so good.

FILM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW


6A — Monday, January 9, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

DFA RECORDS

James Murphy is my dad.

The early 2000s get far too 

much credit for their contribution 
to the emo movement. Yes, the era 
blessed us with Take This to Your 
Grave, In Love and Death and Your 
Favorite Weapon, but 1999 gave 
us truly untouchable gems like 
the quintessential first self-titled 
record by American Football. Yet, 
the true diamond in the rough of 
’99 is Something to Write Home 
About by The Get Up Kids, a tender 
forerunner of the more upbeat 
pop-punk to come in the following 
decade.

I often find myself playing the 

“which album would I rather 
listen to” game with myself and, 
when I’m feeling the emo-punk 
spectrum, rarely anything beats 
Something to Write Home About. 
The fact of the matter is, The Get 
Up Kids did it the best before the 
genre ever hit the mainstream. 
Nearly two decades later, barely 
anything within today’s “Emo 
Revival” comes close to the genius 
of this record. Nothing feels quite 
as fresh.

“Constants aren’t so constant 

anymore,” 
sings 
Matt 
Pryor 

on “Valentine.” Our world is 
turbulent. Life itself is turbulent, 
and it really sucks when you realize 
nothing is constant as you grow 
up. Emo music is emotional for a 
reason (duh), and because of this, 
it’s incredibly relatable. It’s also 
why lyrics like those found on this 

album remain timeless, regardless 
of its tweeny sentiments.

And truly it’s the success and 

timelessness of Something to 
Write Home About that is a dead 
giveaway as to why emo music is 
thriving again in the first place. 
It’s so easy to chalk emo music 
up to cliches like “sad boys” and 
“Warped Tour kids,” but these 
stereotypes only muddle the true 
accessibility of most of the genre. 
The melodies on this record are 
poppy and fun, consisting of 
rocking riffs lined with floaty 
synth lines, uplifted expertly with 
Pryor’s earnestly raspy vocals. This 
album is still pertinent because 
it showcases just how easy it is to 
enjoy music within the daunting 
and convoluted umbrella term that 
is emo.

“My 
Apology” 
represents 

almost everything that makes an 
emo song, well, emo. It includes 
sentiments still present in most 
of modern emo’s most successful 
works from bands such as Modern 
Baseball and The Front Bottoms. 
Uncertainty, gaining confidence 
and having feelings you would 
really rather kick to the curb are 
all staples in the poignant genre 
showcased in this track. If lyrics 
like “Sometimes I’m old enough 
to keep routine / sometimes I’m 
child enough to scream,” don’t 
make you take a double-take 
at your own life, you have far 
more certainty than is humanly 
possible, dear reader.

A close friend once told me 

that, when reviewing art, I should 

ask myself, “Is this accomplishing 
what it wants to accomplish?” I’ve 
listened to Something to Write 
Home About at least a hundred 
times, and every listen feels 
like the first: it’s fresh, fun and 
unapologetically emotional like 
emo should be. It accomplishes 
these feats with flying colors by 
presenting its angst-ridden vibe 
amongst its dynamic catalogue 
of 12 tracks from pop-punk 
anthems indicative of the turn 
of the millennium to piano-
heavy tracks that bring modern 
classics like “Miserable at Best” 
by Mayday Parade to mind.

In 
1999, 
Pitchfork 
gave 

this album a egregious 2.0 
— 
with 
remarks 
such 
as 

“mind-numbingly 
uninspired, 

adolescent pop.” There’s an 
obvious issue with reducing the 
album to only pop music, as it 
clearly explores punk influences 
from previous decades. The 
reviewer goes on to say, “The 
Get 
Up 
Kids 
write 
from 

assumption, not passion,” while 
assuming that the rawness of 
the album makes it incapable of 
being considered “good” in the 
timeless Pitchfork definition. In 
2017, when I listen to this album, 
I hear a record that is nothing if 
not entirely inspired and written 
completely 
from 
the 
heart. 

Something to Write Home About 
is still the charming, brilliant 
predecessor to the explosive 
popularity of modern emo, and 
an integral milestone in the 
history of the storied genre.

ALL THINGS RECONSIDERED

I used to listen to “All My 

Friends” by LCD Soundsystem 
and dream about when I would 
feel nostalgic for it. If you have 
never listened to LCD, “All 
My Friends” is its magnum 
opus, a bullet train of a song 
that’s undeniably one of the 
best of its generation. Over an 
unstoppable, unchanging piano 
rhythm and the 
slowly increasing 
crescendo 
of 

drums, 
synth 

and 
guitar, 

James 
Murphy 

— the unofficial 
spokesman 
of 

the 
lost, 
aging 

New York hipster 
— 
meditates 

on growing old 
while still trying 
to live the fast 
life.

“You 
spend 

the 
first 
five 

years trying to 
get with the plan 
/ And the next 
five years trying to be with 
your friends again,” he sings. 
“We’re running out of the 
drugs,” he continues. “and the 
conversation’s winding away.” 
Then there’s the line that 
received crazed cheers at their 
supposed farewell show back in 
2011: “To tell the truth / This 
could be the last time.” And the 
repeating refrain to close out 
the song — “If I could see all my 
friends tonight…” — before the 
music seems to disappear into a 
puff of smoke.

My senior year of high school 

was, of course, filled with 
goodbyes — but not really. I 
went off to a school that’s a 
30 minute drive from where 
I grew up, if traffic is bad. I 
came here with over a dozen 
classmates I knew well. I still 
see several regularly, and I keep 
in touch with plenty more. I’m 
kind of proud of the fact that I 
have only really “lost” a small 
handful of friends, and even 
these disconnections felt more-
or-less natural.

“All 
My 
Friends” 
was 

a 
fantastic 
song, 
one 
that 

grabbed me and didn’t let go 
for seven-and-a-half minutes, 
but it never conjured up any 
specific 
memories. 
It 
was 

never mainstream enough to 
be a song I danced to with 
people. It never soundtracked a 
celebratory occasion. It mainly 
just stayed in my pocket on 
my “Top 25 Most Played” iPod 
playlist.

Through college, I always 

seemed to make 
a special point 
of listening to it 
at the end of the 
summer, usually 
when I realized 
I 
was 
driving 

around 
Livonia 

for the last time 
in a while. It 
turned 
into 
a 

ceremonial thing 
— I’d turn it up 
loud and try to 
inhabit the lyrics, 
even 
though 

I 
was 
usually 

just 
making 
a 

mundane trip to 
a grocery store or 

library. Each time, I felt like the 
song would touch some part of 
me that needed to connect, but 
even though I enjoyed the goofy 
devotion of the whole practice, 
I don’t know if 
I can say that it 
ever quite moved 
me.

The 
line 

Murphy 
sings 

that 
always 

sticks out to me 
when 
I 
listen 

is 
the 
classic: 

“I 
wouldn’t 

trade one stupid 
decision 
/ 
For 

another five years of life.” It’s 
tailor-made for a high school 
yearbook quote, and I always, 
every time I listen, think about 
whether it’s true.

2016 
was 
the 
first 
year 

I started noticing the ages 
of 
celebrities 
who 
died. 
I 

subtracted my age from theirs 
and wondered what fraction 
of my life had already been 
lived — and whether I could 

comprehend the amount of 
time I theoretically had left. 
More pressingly, I checked to 
see if they were younger than 
my parents, and if they were, I 
searched for mitigating factors 
and tried to find relief in the 
revelations that these famous 
people smoked cigarettes or 
lived 
otherwise 
unhealthy 

lifestyles.

I have made a lot of stupid 

decisions in my life, only some 
of which turned out to be good 
stories later. There are hospital 
trips that could have been 
avoided; there’s that time I 
slammed a door on a friend and 
almost broke her mirror; the 
multiple times I spilled wine on 
carpets.

What I’m trying to say is that 

I don’t think I actually identify 
with “All My Friends.” Murphy 
sings like an everyman, and his 
arrangement is visionary, so it’s 
the kind of song any lover of 
music can appreciate. There’s 
a certain anticipation, though, 
that I have whenever I queue 
it up — I’m looking forward to 
powerful emotions. I’m ready 
to feel something that never 
quite hits.

But now, I’m ready for actual 

goodbyes. The friends I never 
really left in high school are 
getting jobs out of state. I just 
finished up my time at the first 

job I ever loved. 
I’ll leave for the 
summer without 
the certainty of 
returning to see 
the same people 
again.

I’ll finally be 

able to say “To 
tell the truth / 
This 
could 
be 

the last time and 
mean it,” and I 

can’t help feeling like at some 
point soon I’m going to listen to 
LCD Soundsystem and actually, 
legitimately start crying. I’ll 
start 
getting 
nostalgic 
and 

suddenly I won’t be able to stop.

The seriousness with which the 

“Underworld” series treats itself 
has always been its greatest asset 
and detriment, lending credibility 
to the expansive, legitimately 
impressive 
mythology 
while 

draining 
the 

present-day 
action of some 
of the fun it 
could have had. 
The movies are 
occasionally 
passable, 
if 
mostly 

forgettable 
action-horror 
flicks. 
“Blood 

Wars” 
feels 

different 
than 

the other films of 
the franchise, as if the filmmakers 
knew they wanted to make another 
chapter in the series, but were 
unsure of what shape it would 
take. The result is a film that lacks 
weight in every part of itself — 
from its story, to its characters, to 
even the series’ particular brand of 
action.

That’s not to say it would be 

fair to expect the “Underworld” 
series 
to 
explore 
weighty 

themes 
or 
anything 
of 
the 

sort. They’re essentially B-list 
movies better known for their 
trademark “swords, sandals and 
semiautomatics” brand of insanity 
than any sort of complex plotting 
or layered characterization. Still, 
even the action falls flat in “Blood 

Wars,” with the crux of at least 
two action scenes being two men 
shooting each other with high-
powered rifles at point blank range 
while screaming a la ’80s action 
stars. The action is further bogged 
down by the manic editing the 
series is equally well known for, 
which renders what could have 
been entertaining combat hard to 
understand and harder to enjoy.

Even 
the 
story 

doesn’t feel like it 
has any real purpose 
with regards to the 
world the filmmakers 
have spent four films 
and fourteen years 
constructing. “Blood 
Wars” centers around 
the rise of Marius 
(Tobias 
Menzies, 

“Outlander”), a Lycan 
who has the power to 
make the movie enter 
an incomprehensible, 

choppy slow motion whenever he 
comes on screen. He wants the 
blood of Selene’s (Kate Beckinsale, 
“Love & Friendship”) daughter, 
but Selene doesn’t know where 
she is, so he simply decides to 
kill people. It feels incredibly 
pointless. There’s also an out-
of-place subplot featuring the 
political machinations of one of 
the vampires, as if director Anna 
Foerster (“Outlander”) believes 
herself to be making some sort of 
monochromatic episode of “Game 
of Thrones.”

Even components that feel like 

they should have enormous weight 
for the characters and should 
contribute to something, anything, 
resembling an arc are glossed over 

in a matter of seconds. “Blood 
Wars” seems to genuinely believe 
that it has character arcs, but the 
characters are, for all intents and 
purposes, the same people they 
were at the beginning of the story. 
They have changed only in physical 
location and status. It’s hard to 
give “Awakening,” the previous 
worst film in the franchise, credit 
for much, but Selene had an actual 
emotional transition over the 
course of the film.

With that in mind, it is difficult 

to criticize the talented cast for 
what amounts to a collection of 
phoned-in performances. They’re 
simply given nothing with which 
to work. Beckinsale, ever the series’ 
hidden weapon, manages a few 
scenes of legitimate emotion, but 
the script strands her in a plotline 
involving an early frontrunner 
for deus ex machina of the year. 
The rest of the characters are 
burdened with constantly saying 
exactly what they’re thinking and 
entire scenes pass where nothing 
is spoken except clunky exposition.

If there’s one thing that can 

be said for the “Underworld” 
movies, it’s that they have always 
tried. They have aimed to create 
a unique mythology and to create 
interesting stories. Whether or 
not they have succeeded is up to 
individual assessment, but “Blood 
Wars” seems like the film where 
the filmmakers stopped trying. By 
the time the credits roll, the whole 
thing just feels meaningless and 
unnecessary. Hardcore fans of the 
series may find something to enjoy, 
but those on the fence will likely 
find it unsatisfying and overall 
unentertaining.

Some perspective

The Michigan football and 
basketball teams have left 
something to be desired in 
their respective seasons, but 
they have come a long way. 
» SportsMonday Column, 

Page 2B

After the Michigan men’s 

basketball team came out sluggish 
Wednesday before clawing back 
to beat Penn State, there was a 
consensus from the Wolverines 
that they needed to find a way to 
come out strong from the start.

Saturday against Maryland, 

(2-1 Big Ten, 14-2 overall) 
Michigan came out with a bit 
more energy but couldn’t find 
its shooting stroke — at one 
point shooting just 33 percent 
from the field and 15 percent 
from behind the arc.

Though their offense found 

new life in the second half, the 
Wolverines (1-2, 11-5) couldn’t 
recover from the early deficit, 
losing 77-70 at Crisler Center 

on Saturday.

Michigan improved its offense 

in the first half by attacking the 
rim, but its defense left much to 
be desired and Michigan went 
into the halftime break down, 
37-28. 

“It’s 
just 
very 
frustrating,” 

said sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner. “When you’re out there on 
the court and work your butt off, 

and then get beat at home like that.

“There 
are 
just 
moments 

where it seems like we fall asleep 
collectively.”

Junior 
guard 
Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rakhman and senior 
guard Zak Irvin led the team 
in the first half with six points 
each, while Maryland forward 
Damonte Dodd led all scorers 
with 11 points.

Michigan caught a break with 

Maryland’s Michal Cekovsky, 
a 7-foot-1 forward, out of the 
lineup Saturday. But Dodd, 
who stands at 6-foot-11 and 
had been averaging just 5.9 
points per game before entering 
Saturday’s contest, filled in 
nicely for the Terrapins and 
finished with 15 points.

The second half was a bit 

more favorable for Michigan. 
The Wolverines started the half 

on a 9-1 run to cut the deficit to 
one.

But every time Michigan got 

close, 
Maryland 
responded. 

The 
Wolverines 
closed 
the 

deficit to two multiple times in 
the second half, but each time, 
the Terrapins answered with a 
bucket of their own to extend 
their lead.

“It was tough,” Beilein said. 

“When we made a big play to cut 
(the lead) down, they’d make one 
coming right back. It’s hard to 
keep doing that.”

A lot of that was because of 

Maryland’s Melo Trimble, who 
started to heat up in the second 
half and finished with 13 points 
and 6 assists.

Forwards Justin Jackson and 

Jared Nickens also added 15 and 
12 points, respectively, for the 
Terrapins.

Maryland ended the game 

shooting 51.9 percent, and made 
10-of-15 from behind the arc.

“Today, we were locked in,” 

said Maryland coach Mark 
Turgeon. 
“We 
made 
shots 

today.

“We made some tough ones. 

We’re a really good shooting 
team and we’re still getting 

used to each other. … But we 
made shots today.”

On the other side of the court, 

Wagner led all scorers with 17 
points.

While another Big Ten loss isn’t 

crippling for Michigan’s NCAA 
Tournament hopes, it leaves little 
room for error the rest of the way. 

But in the meantime, the 

Wolverines have a lot of work to 
do, mainly on the defensive side 
of the ball.

“We have to really close out 

on shooters,” Beilein said. “We 
need to get the shooters. Like 
today, (Maryland guard Kevin 
Huerter), Jackson and Nickens, 
those are not guys you close out 
short and contest, you just run 
them off the line. Well, a couple 
times, we closed out short and 
dared them to shoot it, and 
that’s what they do well.”

Wolverines experience a turbulent week in recruiting

The Michigan football team 

was looking to do something 
no other team has done since 
rankings were introduced to the 
recruiting process: sign back-
to-back No. 1 overall prospects. 
The Wolverines signed Rashan 
Gary — ranked No. 1 in 247Sports’ 
composite rankings of the 2016 
class — and were looking to do the 
same this cycle with Najee Harris, 
a running back from California.

While Michigan was able to 

hold off a late surge from Clemson 
to sign Gary, it was unable to 
flip Harris, a longtime verbal 
commitment to Alabama, despite 
an aggressive year-long pursuit 
that included a satellite camp held 
in Antioch (Harris’ hometown), an 
appearance from Jim Harbaugh at 
Harris’s homecoming game and a 
late official visit to Ann Arbor in 
December.

It was a razor-close finish — the 

type to be expected for a player of 
Harris’s caliber — that will leave 
a sour taste in the Wolverines’ 
mouths, especially considering 
Harris or someone in his camp led 
them to believe that he would be 
a Wolverine at some point in the 
process, according to Steve Lorenz 
of Wolverine 247.

“Finding out as close as it 

sounds like it was, I believe 
(Harris) was just a conflicted kid 
who was going back and forth in 
his mind on what he was going 
to do,” Lorenz said. “He was not 
someone who was going to be 
influenced by Tua Tagovailoa, that 
type of stuff. It was all him, it was 
his call.”

Missing out on Harris leaves 

Michigan with two running backs 
in the class — verbal commits 
Kurt 
Taylor 
and 
O’Maury 

Samuels. A third running back, 
AJ Dillon, recently switched his 
commitment from the Wolverines 
to Boston College.

Lorenz believes that Michigan 

may choose to stand pat at the 
position, similar to how it has 
approached the tight end position. 
The Wolverines may add a running 
back if they find someone they 
believe to be good enough or flip a 
commitment from another school, 

but “they’re not going to reach 
just to fill that slot”, according to 
Lorenz.

“... You could see them maybe 

make a run at Chase Hayden, 
Arkansas commitment,” Lorenz 
said. “(Hayden’s) a player that 
(running backs coach) Tyrone 
Wheatley really, really liked. … 
There were rumors that they’re 
recruiting AJ Davis… I don’t think 
anything is going to happen there, 
though. Opinion wise, I would be 
interested to see if Michigan tried 
to recruit Khalan Laborn out of 
Virginia Beach. He’s committed 
to Florida State. I could see 
Michigan maybe saying, ‘Do you 
want to split carries with (Cam 
Akers) or be the guy in our class? 
’... It’s recruiting. It’s wide-open 
as always. My hunch tells me they 
may try to stick with what they 
have right now, unless something 
falls into their lap.”

It wasn’t all bad news for 

Michigan 
over 
the 
weekend, 

though. Chuck Filiaga, a consensus 
four-star prospect and the No. 
98 overall player in the nation, 
announced Saturday at the Army 
All-American Game that he would 
be joining the Wolverines. Filiaga 
is the sixth offensive lineman in 
Michigan’s class and the second 
highest-ranked after center Cesar 
Ruiz.

It was a big win on the trail 

for the Wolverines, who recently 
missed out on Isaiah Wilson, 
a five-star tackle who chose 
Georgia over Michigan. According 
to 
Lorenz, 
Michigan 
views 

Filiaga — along with Ruiz and 
Andrew Stueber — as potential 
contributors next season.

“(Filiaga) 
was 
silently 

committed to Michigan for a 
while,” Lorenz said. “… He’s a 
perfect fit for the program as 
a player and a person. … I’m 
interested to see where Michigan 
wants to put (Filiaga), because 
he played right tackle this week, 
which is not where he’s used to 
playing. He had some difficulty 
picking up the steps from a 
footwork standpoint because he’s 
only ever played left tackle. I think 
that’s why he didn’t start in the 
(Army All-American) game on 
Saturday.

“I think it’s a big win for Jim 

Harbaugh. Michigan hasn’t done 
well in Texas. I know he’s not a 
Texas native (Filiaga moved to 
Texas from California for his 
senior year) … (but) they had to 
beat out Big 12-type area programs 
to get him. It’s a big win for them 
in that regard, and it’s a huge win 
because, as big as a loss Harris is, 
(the) offensive line was still their 
biggest need.”

Meanwhile, 
Michigan 
also 

received some news regarding the 
recruitment of Aubrey Solomon, 
a highly-touted defensive tackle 
from Leesburg, Ga.

Solomon 
committed 
to 

Michigan while in Ann Arbor 
on an unofficial visit over the 
summer, but decommitted just 
months later, citing a recruiting 
letter sent by Michigan that 
mispelled his name as the primary 
factor in his decision.

Considering 
prospects 
who 

decommit from a school rarely end 
up playing for that same team, most 
had written off the Wolverines. 
But Solomon’s recruitment took 
yet another interesting turn this 
week while he was in San Antonio 
participating in the Army All-
American game.

“Aubrey’s recruitment is going 

to be the biggest mess — that’s my 
early prediction from here until 
Feb. 1,” Lorenz said. “ … 48 hours 
(ago) he says, ‘Fuck Michigan’ on 
Periscope and 48 hours later, if 
signing day was today, he would 
be signing with Michigan. That’s 
where this recruitment is at right 
now.

“Some people around him have 

questions about Alabama as a fit 
… Michigan has a lot of plusses in 
their favor.”

Lorenz says the Wolverines 

have done a great job with 
Solomon’s 
mom 
while 
also 

recruiting him harder than any 
other team. Michigan can also 
offer an opportunity that other 
schools 
may 
not: 
immediate 

playing time. Several interior 
defensive linemen will graduate 
this spring, leaving an opening for 
a freshman to make an immediate 
impact.

Solomon happens to be the 

type of recruit who could do so — 
Lorenz, who attended practices 
for the Army All-American game 

this past week, thought Solomon 
might have been the best defensive 
tackle there.

“One 
of 
the 
(Army 
All-

American) coaches was saying 
that (Solomon’s) already a really 
great player, but he has the 
potential to take an even further 
step up and be a game-changing 
guy in the middle,” Lorenz said.

Solomon is expected to make 

a final decision sometime close 
to National Signing Day on Feb. 
1, and with the turns seen so 
far, it wouldn’t be a surprise if 
there are a few more left in store. 
While Michigan may be in the 
lead now, it will have to compete 
with Alabama and Georgia for his 
signature.

Willie Gay, a linebacker from 

Starkville, Miss., is another top 
target for the Wolverines who 
spent the week in San Antonio, 
and 
the 
news 
surrounding 

his 
recruitment 
was 
slightly 

less 
positive 
for 
Michigan. 

Louisiana State lost a linebacker 
commitment, 
stepped 
up 
its 

pursuit of Gay and is now in 
strong contention for the four-star 

prospect.

“... To me, it’s a typical, classic, 

‘Does he want to stay South or is he 
willing to go North?’ type battle,” 
Lorenz said. “(Gay) has members 
of his camp that are really high on 
(Michigan’s) program. The funny 
thing about him is he’s the biggest 
Jabrill Peppers fan, and I think 
that’s been a big thing for him.”

Michigan is hoping to add 

Gay to its class as the sole SAM 
linebacker — according to Lorenz, 
Jordan 
Anthony 
and 
Drew 

Singleton are slated to be WILL 
linebackers, while Josh Ross and 
Ben Mason will be MIKEs.

“Basically the way Michigan 

is angling it is, ‘We have an open 
SAM spot in this cycle. We need a 
guy to come in and play this spot. 
You could be that guy if you sign 
here, and you get to take the spot 
of the player you idolize,’ ” Lorenz 
said. “That’s a big deal to (Gay) — 
he thought it was awesome. He’s 
like, ‘Even when Michigan started 
recruiting me, I didn’t realize that 
this is how it would end up. That 
I would get the chance to replace 
the player I’ve always looked to 

as my favorite college football 
player.’ ”

Gay is expected to pick his 

final 
destination 
on 
National 

Signing Day, and Lorenz says that 
Michigan hopes to host Gay for an 
unofficial visit (he took his official 
visit for the Illinois game Oct. 22) 
sometime before his decision — 
most likely after his scheduled 
visit to LSU on Jan. 20.

The one factor that may help 

Michigan win this recruitment is 
head coach Jim Harbaugh, who is 
expected to focus his recruiting 
efforts on Gay after previously 
acting as the point man in Filiaga’s 
recruitment.

The finish to the Wolverines’ 

last recruiting cycle was hectic, 
to say the least, as their 2016 class 
underwent significant changes 
over the final stretch. While 
Michigan’s 2017 class should 
undergo less upheaval this time 
around, its pursuit of Solomon 
and Gay should go down to the 
wire and will provide two more 
opportunities for the team and its 
fans to experience the twists-and-
turns of recruiting.

How quickly we forget

L

et’s start with a couple of 
facts about the Michigan 
football season. First, it was 

a disappointment. The Wolverines 
finished 10-3. They hoped and 
expected to finish better.

Second, 

there was a 
fair amount 
of heartbreak 
involved. 
Michigan lost 
on the final 
play of the 
game three 
times, each 
different than 
the last. They 
all uniquely hurt the Wolverines.

Michigan did a fair amount of 

watching, too. The Wolverines 
watched Wisconsin and Penn 
State play for the Big Ten 
Championship, Ohio State in the 
College Football Playoff and Penn 
State in the Rose Bowl.

For all of those reasons, it’s 

going to be tempting for fans to 
sit down again Monday, watch 
Clemson and Alabama play for 
the national championship and 
feel ungrateful. Disappointment 
and heartbreak are reasonable 
emotions to have. It is an enviable 
position to feel them after a 10-win 
season.

Let’s not forget that it could be 

worse.

Let’s admit another fact about 

both of Michigan’s highest-profile 
programs. The football and men’s 
basketball teams are stagnant this 
season. The football team finished 
10-3 last year and 10-3 this year. 
The men’s basketball team exited 
in the first round of the NCAA 
Tournament last season and seems 
to be headed for a similar finish 
this season.

In the same way, it’s easy 

for fans to watch another 
Michigan men’s basketball loss 
like Saturday’s, in which the 
Wolverines were outplayed in a 
77-70 home loss to Maryland, and 
wonder how much better things 

could be. But don’t forget how 
good they are, either.

First, football. Many of the 

137 teams in the history of 
Michigan football have finished 
better than 10-3. There’s no 
denying that. But you would 
have been thrilled two years 
ago if someone had told you the 
Wolverines would win 20 games 
in the next two seasons.

Now and two years ago differ in 

many ways, but consider this one: 
This season, Michigan traveled 
to Piscataway and humiliated 
Rutgers, 78-0. The last time the 
Wolverines made that trip — not in 
a different era, not even five years 
ago — they lost that game, 26-24, 
in 2014.

Michigan’s players have grown 

confident in the program they have 
revived. After that game two years 
ago, then-junior tight end Devin 

Funchess was stuck saying, “Wins 
and losses, that’s just a statistic.” 
The Wolverines now have a lot 
more wins.

The embarrassments of 2014 

need not be relived. So much is 
different now.

Two years ago, as Ohio State 

marched toward a national 
championship and Michigan 
missed a bowl game, in the days 
leading up to the matchup then-
redshirt junior center Jack Miller 
admitted: “They are playing for a 
lot, and we’re not.” This season, 
that was not the case in “The 
Game.”

The following week, then-

interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett did what he had to do 
and fired Hoke. He gave a positive 
press conference in which he 
vowed, “The head coach of 
Michigan football is one of the 

finest jobs in American sports 
today, and we will have great 
options.” But even then, it seemed 
a bit unlikely.

Later that month, the Daily 

printed a list of seven coaches 
Michigan might consider: Dan 
Mullen, Craig Bohl, Les Miles, 
Tom Herman, David Shaw, Butch 
Jones and Jim Harbaugh. All 
but Miles are head coaches now, 
from Texas to Wyoming. Some 
may have been good fits here, but 
there’s not much of an argument 
that anyone could have turned 
around the program as quickly as 
Harbaugh has.

And then there’s the men’s 

basketball program, where 
excitement might be a little harder 
to see. Still, a journey through 
history lends a bit of perspective.

In 2007, when Michigan fired 

Tommy Amaker and hired John 

Beilein to become its new head 
coach, the Wolverines had not 
made the NCAA Tournament 
since 1998. Worse, enthusiasm 
surrounding the program was low, 
Crisler Center was an afterthought 
and the team showed few signs of 
forward momentum.

The week Beilein was hired, the 

Daily wrote that one of his first 
priorities would be to maintain 
the commitment of a highly touted 
recruit, a Michigan Mr. Basketball 
winner from Redford by the name 
of Corperryale “Manny” Harris. 
Beilein did that, and Harris led the 
coach’s second team to the NCAA 
Tournament in 2009.

Much more prosperity followed, 

and the basketball program rose 
in stature as a result. In the Daily’s 
coverage of Beilein’s introductory 
press conference, this newspaper 
wrote, “The other major issue 

at hand was Michigan’s lack 
of practice facilities. Beilein 
acknowledged that he and (former 
Athletic Director Bill) Martin 
have a general plan for the future, 
but said nothing was set in stone. 
When pressed on the fact that he 
indeed, wasn’t guaranteed a new 
practice facility, Beilein deflected 
the question.”

“That’s all I can ask, is give 

us a chance to compete with our 
competitors and recruiting young 
men, practicing and developing 
our players,” Beilein said that 
day.

Ten years later, he has a 

pristine new practice facility, 
the William Davidson Player 
Development Center, and Crisler 
Center is newly renovated. Back 
then, the future of the program 
under Beilein seemed uncertain. 
In breaking down the pros and 
cons of 12 possible hires, the 
Daily wrote that Beilein, then 
54, “may not be interested in 
coaching for much longer.”

A decade later, it’s safe to say he 

was. Beilein has led Michigan to 
one of its longest runs of success. 
Wednesday, he won his 200th 
game at the helm of the program, 
and he will likely go down as the 
best head coach in its history.

It’s funny what happens 

when you look back on those 
moments. Two years ago, the Daily 
predicted the chances of each of 
those coaches being Michigan’s 
next hire. In the section about 
Harbaugh, the answer to the 
question “Could it happen?” was 
“No matter how hard you wish, it’s 
not likely.” The paragraph added, 
“But if Hackett were able to swing 
the deal, it could the beginning of a 
turnaround.”

He did, and it was. Michigan 

has Harbaugh, it has Beilein and it 
could do a lot worse. Don’t forget 
that.

28 former players skated onto the 
ice at Yost Ice Arena on Saturday 
night. Some players knew Scott 
Matzka personally from their 
time 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Others 

participated simply to see old 
friends and to help a member of 
the “Michigan family.”

But one player stood out from 

the rest. He was a bit younger 
and a few feet shorter. Wearing 
his father’s No. 10 jersey, Owen 
Matzka joined his father’s former 
teammates in the pre-game skate 
and would later score a goal.

“That’s probably the most 

difficult emotional thing I’ve 
had to deal with,” Scott Matzka 
said. “I see the guys out there, 
laughing and having a great time, 
but seeing (my son) really pulls at 
my heartstrings.

“It’s so cool that he’s getting 

some of these cool experiences, 
and stuff he’s never gonna forget. 
I’m trying to not cry and not get 
emotional, but I see him out there 
and then I’m tearing up.”

Matzka was diagnosed with 

ALS in the summer of 2014. The 
event Saturday featured Matzka’s 
former teammates taking on the 
Detroit Red Wings alumni club 
to raise money for 
ALS.

After 
the 

pre-game 
skate, 

Matzka and his 
family stood at 
center 
ice 
and 

participated 
in 

the 
ceremonial 

puck 
drop. 

Matzka thanked 
the 
1,500- 

plus 
fans 
in 

attendance.

Then, Matzka joked with the 

players, urging them to avoid 
suffering a heart attack during 
the game.

Designed to raise awareness 

and funds for Matzka’s ALS 
foundation (MyTurn), the event 
also reunited former Wolverines, 
some of whom have lost touch 

with each other 
over the years.

Josh Langfeld 

is 
only 
one 

example. 
They 

played 
together 

at 
Michigan 

but 
distance 

keeps them from 
seeing each other 
regularly. 
This 

game, 
though, 

provided 
an 

opportunity 
for 
the 
former 

linemates to reconnect.

“It was awesome,” Langfeld 

said. “A truly great experience. 
Scott was my roommate freshman 

year in West Quad. We won the 
national championship together, 
we did a lot of great things. … He 
was my guy. We leaned on each 
other a lot over the years, so it’s a 
great thing to celebrate.”

Added Matzka: “I haven’t had 

a chance to stay in touch with all 
these guys, and it sucks that it has 
to be under these circumstances, 
but it’s incredible to see everyone 
that’s shown up. The guys, the 
fans, people that are helping out 
around the rink. It’s hard to put 
into words.”

It 
wasn’t 
just 
former 

Michigan players who enjoyed 
participating in the game, as the 
event also involved a team of 
former Red Wings players. Dave 
Coulier, perhaps best known as 
“Uncle Joey” from the television 
show “Full House,” relished the 

opportunity to play with the Red 
Wings while supporting Matzka’s 
cause. Coulier has played with 
the Red Wings alumni team 
before and heard about the event 
from some of his 
friends who went 
to 
Michigan. 

Though 
he 

lacks a personal 
connection 
to 

Matzka 
and 

the disease, he 
recognized 
the 

importance of the 
event and what it 
meant to Matzka 
and his family.

“I think you’ve got a lot people 

with big hearts, who realize 
the importance of life, and how 
something like ALS can affect 
family and friends and personal 

lives,” Coulier said. “It’s brave 
on a whole other level, and guys 
just want to come out and support 
that. (They say) ‘Hey we’re 
looking out for you and we’re here 

to lend a hand.’

“It’s something 

we love to do. 
We love to get 
together and play 
hockey, but it’s 
especially 
great 

when 
you 
can 

take that and turn 
it 
into 
helping 

someone 
and 

their family.”

The 
game 

itself featured 17 goals, with the 
Wolverines’ alumni holding off a 
late comeback by their Red Wings 
counterparts in a 10-7 victory. 
The score had little importance, 

though. What mattered was that 
Matzka’s teammates all returned 
to support, honor and play for 
him.

“Obviously 
as 
a 
team, 

especially being from the class 
of 1998, and then you go ‘99, ‘00 
and then ‘01, whenever you have a 
cause like that, the Michigan men 
assemble,” said former Wolverine 
forward Matt Herr. “It was great 
to 
see 
everybody. 
Whenever 

there’s a cause or a teammate 
needs you, nothing ever changes, 
the guys are there.

“It was fun tonight to get out 

there, put the skates on, and 
great to see Scott and his family. 
I think it meant a lot to these guys 
to be able to do that with Scott. 
If there is anything we can do to 
help another Michigan man, it is 
always good.”

28 players took the ice for 

the 
Wolverines, 
but 
Herr 

believes many more could have 
participated. Numerous alumni 
reached out to Chris Frescoln 
and L.J. Scarpace, who helped 
organize the event. Herr guesses 
that Michigan had the potential 
to “fill six teams.”

The night included reunions, 

tearful hugs, jokes about college 
life, and of course, a hockey 
game. Yet, most importantly, it 
honored Matzka and his fight 
against ALS.

“Thank you on behalf of all 

of Michigan for your strength 
and for everything that you are 
doing,” Herr said to Matzka 
during the event. “It takes a lot of 
courage, to stand up and say, ‘Hey, 
we’re gonna battle this.’ With two 
small kids and a wife, it breaks 
your heart.

“He could have done a lot 

of things like (say) ‘Hey, I feel 
sorry for myself.’ But that’s not 
the Michigan way, and that’s 
not Scotty Matzka. Instead, he’s 
chosen to get the word out and 
help other people, and hopefully 
that carries on and keeps battling 
ALS.”

Amine bests fellow All-American

It was the first minute of his 

match against Iowa’s No. 13 
Alex Meyer and Myles Amine 
made it clear that he had been 
saving all his energy while on 
the sidelines for the mat.

“I try to stay calm,” 174-

pound 
redshirt 
freshman 

Amine said after winning, 6-5. 
“ ... I don’t want to waste too 
much energy screaming or 
yelling. I’m definitely rooting 
for those guys and hoping that 
they win the match, but I have 
to stay calm and reserve all 
my energy before I wrestle. 
Mentally, probably I will be 
cheering these guys on but 
physically probably you won’t 
see me getting up there and 
screaming at the ref or doing 
anything crazy.” 

Right off the bat, a double-

leg takedown put Amine in 
the lead. Going into the second 
period, he had notched over a 
minute of riding time. In the 
second period, Meyer managed 
an escape to even the score 
before 
surpassing 
Amine’s 

riding time to take the lead in 
the third period.

With the score tied at 5-5 

in the final minute of the 
match, a reversal gave Amine 
a one-point advantage that 
eventually 
earned 
him 
the 

victory. Amine’s win was one 
of two matches falling in favor 
of Michigan in its sold-out dual 
meet against the Hawkeyes last 
Friday night.

“I think the best point in that 

match was that one right off the 
whistle,” Amine said. “Going 
forward, I think I wrestled a 
pretty tough third period, just 
staying offensive and kind of 
pushing myself. I think I could 
have gone a little harder in that 
third period … That’s something 
to work on.”

The match marked the third 

time this season that Amine has 
won against an All-American, 
and the fourth time he has won 
against a ranked opponent. 
Amine only recently moved 
into the top-10 nationally after 
being unranked at the Cliff 
Keen Las Vegas Invitational 
(Dec. 2-3), where he beat two 
All-Americans. 

“He panicked there a little 

bit at the end,” said Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland. “But 
he’s a tough kid, he’s got a huge 
upside.” 

As if Amine’s win wasn’t 

impressive enough, it also came 
at a critical time.

“He was out of practice 

for a little while,” McFarland 
said. “He’s just getting back 
into it after being off the mat 
for a period of time, so I was a 
little worried about where he 
was going to be. To be honest 
with you, a couple days ago we 
weren’t sure he was going to 
go wrestle, but he’s that kind 
of kid. That didn’t deter him at 
all.”

Of the 10 wrestlers in the 

starting lineup, he is currently 
one of seven redshirt freshmen. 
For McFarland, the lack of 
experience creates a learning 
curve, but he can look to 
wrestlers like Amine as an 
example.

“Believing in yourself and 

doing the little things, that’s 
what you need to do to win 
the match,” McFarland said. 
“Those matches that we won 
— Logan Massa, Myles Amine, 
those guys did the work, they 
did all the hard things.”

Amine 
finds 
the 
energy 

of his teammates to be a 
motivator. 
Specifically, 
he 

highlighted redshirt freshman 
Logan Massa, who is currently 
undefeated and ranked at No. 2 
in the national rankings. Massa 
also won his match Friday 
against Iowa’s Joey Gunther.

“I try my hardest not to focus 

on the matches before me,” 
Amine said. “But when you 
watch somebody go out there 
on your team and just dominate, 
it kind of gets you excited, gets 
you ready to wrestle. It’s a good 
one-two punch with Logan and 
I. He comes first and he’s always 
going to bring the pressure and 
the heat, so sometimes I feel the 
thing I (have) to do is to keep up 
and to not let the nerves get to 
me.”

And as Amine just cracked 

the 
national 
rankings, 

McFarland can clearly see what 
the trajectory of his career may 
be.

“He’s going to be really really 

good,” he said. “We need more 
of those kind of efforts. We’ve 
got a lot of work ahead of us.”

Wolverines dominated by Iowa

As soon as redshirt freshman 

Logan Massa claimed Michigan’s 
first victory of the evening in 
the 
165-pound 
weight 
class, 

it appeared that it could turn 
the dual meet around. Massa 
dominated his opponent from 
beginning to end to remain 
unbeaten, but it wasn’t enough 
to propel the wrestling team to 
victory, as it fell to No. 3 Iowa (2-0 
Big Ten, 6-0 overall), 31-7. 

Massa finished with seven 

takedowns, five of which came 
in the first period. With 2:30 
minutes of riding-time, Massa 
cruised to a 16-6 major decision 
victory.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Myles 

Amine 
wanted 
to 
keep 
the 

momentum going in the 174-pound 
match, and he didn’t disappoint. 
He earned an early single-leg 
takedown against 13th-ranked 
Alex Meyer to give him the lead, 
but even after a tough first round, 
the score was just 2-1.

After 
a 
locked-hands 
call 

against the Wolverines and an 
escape from Meyer, the score 
was tied at five. With Amine’s 
riding time dwindling, he needed 
to act fast in order to secure the 
win. Amine delivered with a late 
reversal, winning 6-5.

Massa and Amine cut Iowa’s 

lead to 10, but Michigan proceeded 
to drop the next three matches.

The Wolverines lost too many 

matches that could have easily 
gone the other way, and Iowa 
capitalized on Michigan’s weak 
moments. 
Redshirt 
freshman 

Stevan Micic and No. 1 Cory 
Clark were evenly matched at 133 
pounds, as two stalemates were 
called in the first period resulting 
in a tie at the outset.

Micic had the sold-out crowd 

on their feet with a reversal, 
but after complaints from the 
Hawkeye bench there was an 
official review. Fortunately for 
Iowa, the call didn’t stand and the 
second period ended with both 
men still scoreless.

Clark escaped quickly at the 

beginning of the third period and 
finished with a 1:55 riding-time 
advantage, ultimately securing a 

2-0 win.

“Things didn’t go the way I 

planned it to,” Micic said. “If 
the match would have changed 
a little bit I would have had my 
hand raised, but it really doesn’t 
matter right now. It only matters 
what happens at the Big Ten 
Tournament 
and 
the 
NCAA 

Championships 
in 
a 
couple 

months.

“That’s 
what 

I’m training for 
everyday. 
That 

means 
little 

improvements 
and 
seeing 

mistakes I make 
now and fixing 
them for later.”

With 
an 

18-point deficit heading into the 
final match, Michigan’s hopes for 
a win were impossible. The only 
thing the Wolverines could hope 
for was to try to cut the Hawkeye 
lead by as much possible.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
freshman 

heavyweight Dan Perry couldn’t 
overcome 
his 
inexperience 

against No. 6 Sam Stoll.

There was an official review 

after 
Perry 
wasn’t 
awarded 

what Michigan thought was a 
takedown, though in the end 
he was not given the points. It 
wouldn’t have mattered anyway, 
because Stoll pinned Perry with 
38 seconds left in the first period.

Stoll grabbed Perry’s left leg 

to throw him off balance, forcing 
Perry to fall on his back. His 

inexperience 
as a freshman 
may 
have 
led 

to 
a 
slight 

panic, 
which 

allowed Stoll to 
overpower him. 

“I 
just 
told 

the 
guys, 

‘Guys, we had 
opportunities 
to 
win 
these 

matches, 
we 

just didn’t do the work.’ ” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“We can get a little tougher, we 
can get a little better. Some of 
that’s just working on our grit.

“In 
some 
of 
those 
close 

matches, we just melted in the 
third period and let some of those 
matches get away from us. And all 
that is is hard work and believing 
in yourself, and doing the little 
things you need to do to win the 
match.”

Michigan’s depth an issue against Terps

Forward Zak Irvin and guard 

Derrick Walton Jr. both entered 
Saturday’s 
game 
against 
Maryland 
ranked in the top-five of minutes 
played per game in the Big Ten.

While the pair of seniors have 

insisted that they can handle 
the marathon of spending so 
much time on the court, their 
seemingly bottomless gas tanks 
finally hit empty.

It wasn’t just Walton and 

Irvin 
who 
were 
challenged 

by the workload down the 
stretch versus the Terrapins, 
junior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur Rahkman and redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
each sat just three minutes of 
Saturday’s contest.

After 
facing 
a 
nine-point 

deficit at the half, Michigan had 
the muscle to reduce Maryland’s 
lead to within a single possession 
multiple times. But the Terrapins 
took advantage of their depth 
and week-long break, finding 
the energy to overcome the 
Wolverines’ comeback attempts 
time-and-time again to down 
Michigan at Crisler Center, 77-70.

“I was concerned about the 

third game in (seven) days,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“We came back 10 days ago. 
We haven’t really had a day off, 
and I was concerned about that 
coming in.”

Added Maryland coach Mark 

Turgeon: “I thought we had the 
deeper team today. Our guys 
were great in the first half and 
gave us great depth, and we 
had some fresh legs down the 
stretch.”

The Wolverines used just three 

substitues the entire game, and 
the trio combined for 35 minutes 
— the lowest amount of bench 
minutes thus far in Michigan’s 
three conference games.

Redshirt junior guard Duncan 

Robinson barely played in the 

second half, primarily because 
he wasn’t giving the Wolverines 
the production they needed on 
the defensive end to close the 
deficit.

Robinson 
logged 
just 
11 

minutes, and in that time, had 
just three points from three 
shots with a plus/minus of 
minus four. He wasn’t adding 
enough offense 
or 
defending 

the 
perimeter 

well 
enough 

to 
be 
relied 

upon down the 
stretch. Beilein’s 
only 
option 

to 
make 
the 

defensive stops 
the Wolverines 
needed was to 
stick with his 
starting five and 
manage his timeouts well.

“I thought that was our best 

defensive team on the floor,” 
Beilein said. “If you noticed, I 
called a timeout so we can use 
the (media) timeouts. When 
you have eight minutes to go, 
you’re going to have two media 
(timeouts), and I called a timeout 
and 
(Maryland) 
called 
one. 

There’s no reason to make a 

change.”

One option Beilein did have 

that could deliver defensively off 
the bench was freshman guard 
Xavier Simpson. The freshman 
has seen a rise in his minutes 
the past couple outings, and he 
showed that he had the skill and 
confidence to disturb Maryland’s 
guards.

“(Simpson 

has) 
made 

the 
progress 

in 
practice,” 

Beilein 
said 

“It’s 
good 
to 

have 
(Walton) 

be a little more 
rested. We got to 
find another way 
to have (Walton) 
play some off-
guard at times, 
or maybe have 

those guys out there together.”

Simpson’s final contribution 

was nearly picking the pocket of 
Maryland guard Melo Trimble 
from behind, but the ball went 
out-of-bounds 
before 
any 

Michigan defenders could come 
up with it. Simpson was replaced 
by Walton following the play, 
and 
Walton 
subsequently 

left Trimble open to drain a 

3-pointer seconds after play 
resumed.

Allowing Simpson to ride out 

the momentum he had found 
for just a few more plays could 
have stopped the Terrapins from 
scoring those critical points in 
such a close contest. It could have 
also given Walton and Abdur-
Rahkman a few more seconds of 
rest and a chance to regain some 
mental sharpness to lead the 
Wolverines in crunch time.

As the Big Ten schedule rolls 

on, Beilein will need to challenge 
his bench players, especially 
Simpson and Robinson, to make 
up for their shortcomings and 
enter games ready to contribute. 
While 
Michigan’s 
starters 

have shown they can carry the 
workload, they can still fall 
victim to fatigue.

The Wolverines won’t be able 

to go nine-deep in their rotation 
like the Terrapins did Saturday. 
What will matter most is the 
quality, rather than the quantity, 
of minutes they can receive from 
their bench.

If the quality is high enough, 

Michigan may have the ability to 
overcome, or even prevent, the 
setbacks it has experienced early 
in the conference season.

WOMEN’S GYMNASTICS

Michigan’s perfect conference start
ruined by road loss to the Buckeyes

COLUMBUS 
- 
Entering 

Saturday’s 
matchup, 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team and No. 11 Ohio State were 
two of just three undefeated 
teams that 
remained 
in 
the 

Big 
Ten. 

After 
the 
matchup, 
though, 

only one team maintained their 
untainted 
conference 
record, 

as the Buckeyes defeated the 
Wolverines, 96-87. 

In 
its 
quest 
to 
remain 

undefeated, Michigan faced Ohio 
State in what will be the only 
meeting between the two teams 
this year. It was the Wolverines’ 
second consecutive Big Ten road 
game, and thus far, they haven’t 
fared well away from home. 
With the loss to the Buckeyes, 
Michigan is now 5-4 away from 

Crisler Center. 

“I thought it was a great 

basketball game, a great rivalry 
game,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “We started 
out terrific, but I think (Thome) 
getting into foul 
trouble 
early 

really 
turned 

the 
tides 
and 

went 
in 
Ohio 

State’s 
favor. 

But 
they 
did 

an 
outstanding 

job 
rebounding 

the 
basketball 

and that was an 
area we really 
struggle with.” 

The Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 

13-4 overall) quickly raced to a 
10-3 lead against the Buckeyes 
(4-0, 14-4) within the first 
four minutes of play, as junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty and 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
notched six and four points, 

respectively. 

By the end of the first 

quarter, Flaherty had already 
soared to double-digit scoring, 
surpassing—by a large margin— 
her total of eight points in the 

Wolverines’ 
most recent win 
over Wisconsin. 
By the end of the 
game, 
Flaherty 

had 
a 
season-

high 38 points 
— good for the 
second 
most 

points scored in 
program history.

“Katelynn has 

been 
working 

extremely hard,” Barnes Arico 
said. “She might be the hardest 
working kid I’ve ever been 
around in my entire coaching 
career. So we knew as a staff and 
a team she was going to break out 
of (her recent scoring struggles) 
and tonight, she did.” 

Ohio 
State 
guard 
Kelsey 

Mitchell changed the game with 
three minutes left to play in the 
second, pushing the Buckeyes 
ahead for the first time all game, 
33-32. It was a close lead Ohio 
State wouldn’t give up. 

While freshman guard Kysre 

Gondrezick led a Wolverine 
comeback that tied the game at 
40 in the second, it was the last 
time Michigan wouldn’t trail for 
the rest of the contest. 

“Kysre has been outstanding, 

she’s great for us,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I think tonight, when you 
come into an atmosphere of a 
top team in the country, on their 
home court, that was a little eye-
opening for her. She’s going to 
have a wonderful career for us.” 

By the end of the half, the 

Wolverines were trailing 45-43, 
despite 
tallying 
double-digit 

triples — marking the sixth time 
this season that the team has 
done so. Flaherty, herself, went 
8-for-15 from behind the arc to 
claim a program record for most 
3-pointers in a single game. 

“She’s always moving,” said 

Ohio 
State 
forward 
Shayla 

Cooper. “She gets one step 
advantage on you, it’s hand 
down, man down. She’s going to 
lock down the shot.” 

The Wolverines closed the 

deficit to eight to begin the fourth 
quarter, but even that proved to 
be too large for Michigan to come 
back.

It 
was 
ultimately 
the 

Buckeyes’ defense that hindered 
Michigan. The Wolverines have 
consistently 
shown 
scoring 

depth off their bench, Ohio State 
limited them to 11 points in the 
final five minutes. 

Despite a double-double from 

junior forward Jillian Dunston, 
a team-high 10 assists from 
senior guard Siera Thompson 
and Flaherty’s 38-point outburst, 
Michigan didn’t have enough 
to steal a win in Columbus — 
pushing the Buckeyes’ all-time 
series advantage to 53-11.

Mitchell too much for ‘M’

COLUMBUS 
— 
The 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team and No. 11 Ohio State 
rely heavily on their two star 
guards, 
juniors 
Katelynn 

Flaherty and Kelsey Mitchell, 
respectively. Both players wear 
the number three, are in the 
conversation for All-American 
honors, and are the keys to 
success for their teams this 
season.

The pair of standouts lived 

up to their lofty billing Saturday 
in the battle of the final two 
undefeated 
teams 
in 
the 

conference. While both led their 
respective teams in scoring, 
Flaherty outscored Mitchell, 
38-26. However, the Buckeyes 
would ultimately outscore the 
Wolverines, 
96-87.

“I 
think 

everyone 
around 
the 

country 
who 

caught 
that 

game got to see 
a great matchup 
of two of the 
best guards in 
the 
country,” 

said 
Michigan 

coach 
Kim 

Barnes 
Arico. 

“(Flaherty) was kind of in a 
struggle as of late, but that’s 
not typical of her.”

Added Ohio State coach 

Kevin McGuff: “She’s a really 
good player. She can score in a 
variety of ways, she has a really 
quick shot and she is incredibly 
accurate.”

Flaherty 
came 
out 
hot 

against the Buckeyes, scoring 
10 points in the first quarter 
— two more than she tallied 
in the entire contest against 
Wisconsin 
on 
Jan. 
1. 
But 

Mitchell answered Flaherty 
with eight points of her own, 
which kept Ohio State within 
one at the end of the quarter.

Mitchell took the lead in 

the second quarter, continuing 
her 
ferocious 
attack 
with 

eight more points, including 
a 3-pointer that gave the 

Buckeyes a 33-32 advantage 
with 3:30 to go until halftime.

But 
Flaherty 
countered 

Mitchell 
with 
eight 
more 

points as well, which featured 
a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to 
cut Michigan’s deficit to 45-43 
at halftime.

On the other side of the 

break, Mitchell responded to 
Flaherty’s three with a trey of 
her own. She went on to score 
five points in the quarter to 
push Ohio State’s lead to 69-59 
entering the fourth.

“(Mitchell) is a great player,” 

Flaherty said. “She can score at 
will. A lot of our game plan was 
to stop her. Even though she 
still scored a decent amount, I 
thought we did a pretty good 
job.”

The Wolverines might have 

been run completely out of the 

gym during that 
frame if not for 
Flaherty’s 
11 

points, nine of 
which 
came 

from beyond the 
arc. 
Flaherty 

added 10 more 
points in 
the 

fourth quarter, 
but 
it 
wasn’t 

nearly 
enough 

to 
overcome 

Michigan’s 
deficit.

“I just stayed in the gym and 

kept shooting,” Flaherty said. 
“I built my confidence back up, 
and my teammates found me 
in great positions today. That’s 
what really got me going.”

Even though their individual 

performances stood out the 
most, Flaherty and Mitchell 
were certainly not the only 
contributors on their respective 
teams. Junior guard Jillian 
Dunston notched her second 
double-double of the season, 
and the Buckeyes had five 
players score at least 10 points, 
including forward Stephanie 
Mavunga, who nearly netted a 
double-double of her own with 
12 points and nine rebounds. 

But while the stars of both 

teams lived up to their hype in 
Saturday’s contest, only one of 
the pair came out on top.

Wolverines fall short 
to open their season

For the past 13 years, Utah has 

had a perfect record against the 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team. That trend continued on 
Saturday, as the Wolverines 
lost their first season opener 
since 2009. However, Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki described the 
showdown as a perfect start for 
the team.

“Had 
we 
had 
an 

uncharacteristically great meet, 
I think that people would have 
been pretty satisfied with what 
they are doing,” Plocki said. “I 
think it would have negatively 
affected us down the road.”

With plenty 

to improve upon 
in the upcoming 
season, 
the 

seventh-ranked 
Wolverines fell 
to 
the 
sixth-

ranked 
Utes, 

196.625-195.525, 
in 
Salt 
Lake 

City.

Three 

freshman 
— 
Maddy 
Osman, 
Polina 

Shchennikova 
and 
Lexi 

Funk — got a taste of national 
championship-caliber 
competition 
facing 
Utah 
in 

their collegiate debuts. The 
three competed in front of over 
14,000 people, with Osman in 
the lineup for vault and floor, 
Shchennikova in bars and Funk 
on the beam.

Despite the loss, the meet 

had no shortage of highlights 
for Michigan. Senior captain 
Talia Chiarelli had a stellar 
performance on the vault, floor 
and beam with scores of 9.850, 
9.800 and 9.850, respectively. 
Her scores earned her a nod as 

performer of the meet for the 
Wolverines.

Although junior Paige Zaziski 

had some hiccups early on in the 
meet, she bounced back, with 
an impressive routine on the 
beam. The Wolverines followed 
her lead, putting together a solid 
overall rotation.

The 2016 Big Ten Champion 

on bars, junior Brianna Brown 
kicked off the season with 
a strong start, finishing as 
Michigan’s top scorer in the 
event with a 9.850. She followed 
it up with a strong performance 
on beam, scoring a 9.825. 

Sophomore Emma McLean 

and senior Nicole Artz also had 
standout showings in the meet. 

McLean earned a 
career-high vault 
score with a 9.850 
and 
performed 

an exciting floor 
routine 
that 

secured 
her 
a 

9.825. 
Six-time 

All-American 
Artz 
earned 
a 

team-high score 
of 9.875 for her 
floor routine.

Plocki, who is in her 28th 

season at the helm, attributed 
Michigan’s opening loss to the 
young nature of her team, which 
is still learning the ropes of the 
college stage. 

“Until the freshmen gain more 

confidence 
and 
competitive 

experience, there’s bound to be 
a few mistakes here and there,” 
Plocki said.

Though Utah continued its 

streak, the Wolverines can take 
away the competitive experience 
of the meet heading into this 
week’s practices, as they prepare 
for their upcoming quad meet 
against Ohio State, Washington 
and Kent State next weekend.
