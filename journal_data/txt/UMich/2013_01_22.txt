WASHINGTON - Although
young voters' support for Presi-
dent Barack Obama's re-elec-
tion, was predicted to waver
in November's election, thou-

sands of college-aged students
descended on the Capitol Mon-
day to celebrate the inauguration
ceremony.
Hundreds of thousands of
people - predominantly minor-
ity groups and females - braved
the cold on the National Mall and
along the parade route to see and
celebrate the president taking the
oath of office. Considerably fewer
people attended Monday's events
than Obama's first inauguration,

Obama said although his sec-

and administration will turn
to issues of youth in the United
States, they will in no way forget
those who came before.
"We reject the belief that
America must choose between
caring for the generation that
built this country and investing
in the generation that will biild
its future," Obama said.
He said success for the coun-
try will come from the efforts of
each U.S. citizen.
"We know that America
thrives when every person can
find independence and pride in
their work; when the wages of
honest labor liberate families
from the brink of hardship,"
Obama said.

King advisor discusses
principles of non-violence

Jones talks gun

* Sandy Hook
By DANIELLE WALLICK
For theDaily
On a day that for nearly 30
years has been set aside to com-
memorate the life of Martin
Luther King Jr., the words of
a man who knew him person-
ally echoed throughout the Blau
Auditorium in the Ross School
of Business on Monday.
Clarence B. Jones, an adviser,
lawyer and speechwriter for
King spoke as the William K.
McInally, Memorial Lecturer.
The lecture was established in
1966 in memory of McInally
who served on the University's
Board of Regents from 1960 to
1964.
Past speakers have included
former Secretary of State Made-
leine Albright and Adrian Fenty,

the former mayor of Washing-
ton D.C.. The speech was a part
of the University's 27th annual
Martin Luther King Jr. sympo-
sium.
Entitled "Behind the Dream:
The Making of the Speech,"
Jones spoke about his "dear
friend" whom he worked closely
with on King's famed "I Have
a Dream" speech. Jones served
as one of King's closest political
advisers and confidants.
Jones said Kingnever wanted
to be described as acivil rights
leader. He wanted everyone to
remember that he was first and
foremost "a minister of the gos-
pel," and his title referred to his
Ph.D. in 'systematic theology.
But, Jones did not downplay his
friend's lasting influence on the
nation.
"In 12 years and four months,
from May 1956 to April 4,1968,"
Jones said, "with the exception
of Abraham Lincoln and the
Emancipation Proclamation,

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. may
have done more to achieve polit-
ical and social justice, racial jus-
tice and equality than any other
person or event in the previous
400 years of our nation."
He added that the second
inauguration of the nation's
first African American presi-
dent and the 50th anniversary
of the "I Have a Dream" speech,
provided a unique opportunity
for Americans to examine what
United States stands for.
"We have arrived (at a point)
where our 21st century inter-
pretation of the constitutional
right of the citizen to bear arms
is incompatible with the legacy
of non-violence bequeathed to
us by Martin Luther King Jr.,
America's apostle of non-vio-
lence," Jones said.
Jones said he believes that

Have a Dream" speech in the

Daily StaffReporter
Early Monday morning,
Angela Davis visited the Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Memorial in

Washington. D.C. to reflect on
her long career as an educator,
author and political activist.
Hours later, she arrived at the
University Union to speak about
race and its impact on the prison
industrial complex to a crowd of
more than 600 members of the
University community.
E. Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student

affairs, introduced Davis. Harp-
er noted that Davis's autobiogra-
phy has played an important role
in helping her to understand her
own life.
"She is a leader who has
inspired generations through
the clarity of her thinking and
the content of her character,"
Harper said.

CI CELEBRATION

"We, the people, declare today that the most evident of
truths - that all of us are created equal - is the star that
guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through
Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided
all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left
footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say
that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that
our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the
freedom of every soul on Earth."
President Barack Obama
in his second inaugural address

ADDRESS
From Page 1A
Obama said changes need to
go further for the United States,
replacing programs and policies
that are no longer relevant.
"We understand that outworn
programs are inadequate to the
needs of our time," Obama said.
"So we must harness new ideas
and technology to remake our
government, revamp our tax code,
reform our schools and empower
our citizens with the skills they
need to work harder, learn more,
reach higher."
He added that opportunities
must be available for all in order
to move forward as a nation.
"We do not believe that in this
'country freedom is reserved for
the lucky, or happiness for the
few," Obama said.
Aaron Kall, director of the
University's Debate Institute and
debate team, said Obama's sec-
ond inaugural speech was shorter
than the first but went further in
outlining a liberal policy.
"(Obama's second address) was
more succinct, but it was bolder in
the sense that he felt emboldened
by his reelection victory and the
fact thathe doesn't have to run for
office again," Kall said.
Kall added that the address
touted optimism and partner-
ship with the people of the United
States in winning major policy
battles and laid an unusual frame-
work.
"I think he was in uncharted
territory in this speech and in
terms of his call forequality," Kall
said.
A major facet of Obama's call
for equality is student debt loan
policy, which has many young
U.S. citizens struggling to stay
afloat in the slowly recovering
economy.
Donald Grimes, senior
research associate and economist
at the University's Institute for
Research for Labor, Employment
and the Economy, said growing

finances could reverse recenteco-
nomic growth.
"Student loan debt is one of
those potential exogenous events
that could really upset the apple
cart," Grimes said. "Obviously,
a lot of students have had a hard
time finding jobs."
Grimes said student borrow-
ing for tuition has topped $1
trillion this year. Under a pro-
gram expanded by Obama's first
administration, the government
has been lending more money to
cover student expenses at public,
private and for-profit colleges.
Obama began his first term in
a national economic crisis and
created an economic strategy
accordingly. Grimes said in the
current period of recovery, new
goals must be set to continue on
such a path.
"(The two main problems)
will be the growing inequality
between the haves and the have-
nots and continued difficulties in
dealing with the federal budget
deficit," Grimes said.
Grimes said income inequality
could be at a historic high at the
end of Obama's second term if
measures aren't taken to combat
it.
Among the audience on the
Mall, many. were hopeful about
the next four years, including
American University seniors and
first-time voters Eileen Falk and
Jessica Micciolo.
Falk, from Southbury, Conn.,
said the president has been put-
ting the country on the right track
in terms of policy related to stu-
dents.
"We're always (concerned
about higher education fund-
ing), but I think we're heading
in a good direction with Barack
Obama," Falk said. "It's definitely
a big concern."
Micciolo said the winding
down of her time as an under-
graduate has increased the stress
of dealing with debt.
"We're all graduating in May,
and we're all graduating with a
ton of loans."

OBAMA
From Page 1A
but those in attendance were
noticeably excited about his re-
election.
Eager spectators donned
Obama apparel, danced to Ste-
vie Wonder and chanted across
Pennsylvania Avenue in antici-
pation of seeing the first couple
make their way from the Capi-
tol Building toward the White
House following the inaugural
address. Volunteers worked to
keep the crowd enthused. ,
LSA senior Michael Nevitt,
who attended the inauguration
with a group of University stu-
dents, said he's been a supporter
of Obama since 2008 when he
worked on the then-senator's
presidential campaign. He said
resisting cuts in Pell Grant
funding so more students could
attain a higher education was
one of the biggest factors in his
decision to support the presi-
dent. '
Nevitt added that he believes
Obama could improve on issues
affecting college students such
as tuition affordability and the
environmental protection.
"He said some progres-

sive things about climate
change today,"-Nevitt said, of
the address. "But I'd like to
see a stronger commitment
and stronger goals because I
didn't think that was addressed
enough in his first term."
LSA senior Lauren Coffman,
the communications director
of the University's chapter of
the College Democrats, said
the president's focus on LGBT
issues during his speech was a
welcome addition. ABC News
reported that Obama made his-
tory as the first president to use
the word "gay" in an inaugural
address.
"The president laid out his
vision for his second term and
highlights our nation's continu-
ing struggle for equality for all
citizens," Coffman, who trav-
eled to Washington DC., said.
"His support for LGBT rights
and undocumented students set
a historic precedent for equal-
ity and inclusion."
Stephan Coleman, a 2010
graduate of the University of
Maryland and current Mary-
land resident, said he hopes
Obama continues to push for
lower student loan debt rates in
his second term.
"Four years ago, tuition was

seriously high ... now it's so
much better since (Obama)'s
been in there," Coleman said.
"I think there's so much more
work to do though."
George Washington Univer-
sity sophomore Adey Debebe
also said the student loan issue
played a crucial role in her sup-
port for Obama and believes the
president is a major advocate
for college students.
"He said it in his inaugural
speech: It's all about helping
us so we can help this country
further in the future," Debebe
said. "He doesn't want us to
be unemployed when we come
out of school ... I think it's real-
ly important that people pay
attention to that kind of thing."
Jessi Wolz, Washington, D.C.
resident and recent graduate of
George Washington University,
said she's optimistic about the
president's next four years in
office.
"I'm really looking forward
to Obama being able to under-
take some more difficult poli-
cies," Wolz said. "It's his last
four years, and I think he can
be a little more bold."
Speaking from Ann Arbor,
LSA senior Dana Rollison said
she was excited to hear Obama

speak at length about sustain-
ability issues. Obama's larg-
est environmental push - a
carbon cap and trade measure
that aimed to limit the output
of greenhouse gasses - was
stymied by a divided Senate in
2010.
"I know he can't get very
specific in an inauguration
speech ... but a lot of times he
has fantastic speeches and the
follow-through might get lost a
little bit," Rollison said. "Ifhe
follows through with what he
said in his speech, I will be the
happiest person in the world."
At the pre-inaugural Michi-
gan Congressional Open House
on Sunday, Rep. Sandy Levin
(D-Mich.) said student excite-
ment for the president, con-
trary to popular belief, is still
high. He also emphasized the
importance of University stu-
dents' support of Obama's re-
election.
Levin said Obama's role in
keeping the student loan inter-
est rate from doubling did not
go unnoticed by the president's
college-aged supporters.

Insuring cooperation
New state department should boost economy
Gov. Rick Snyder wasted no time in taking action after his State of
State address on Wednesday evening. On Thursday, Snyder signed an
executive order creating the Department of Insurance and Financial
Service. Through the creation of this department, Snyder hopes to make Mich-
igan's insurance and financial services a bigger policy focus. The governor's
interest in moving the department to cabinet-level indicates an attempt at dif-
fusing party lines, which is a particularly encouraging shift in light of Decem-
ber's lame-duck session in the state legislature. By continuingto work with both
parties, Snyder can strengthen the path to economic recovery in Michigan.

It wasn't just about Obama tak-

are inherently religious, and this one
certainly had the potential to take
that a step further and draw on the
prolific and often religious remarks
of Lincoln and King.

In a nation filled with references
to God, Obama wants us to take an
oath to each other instead, an oath
to make equality a reality for mil-
lions of Americans who are still not
treated as equals as promised.under
the Constitution. It's not about hav-
ing faith in God or a certain higher
power necessarily. It's about having
faith in the person standing next to
you - your neighbor - but mostly
it's people you've never met and will
never know. Because when you have
faith that Americans all want the
same thing, the same basic principles
outlined in the Constitution, we can
trust. one another and treat each
other as equals.
Regardless of whether you believe
God gave us the rights and freedoms
we have today,they must be "secured
by his people here on Earth." Obama
is urging us, the American people, to
work with him to make his goals a
reality. Because the truth is, much of
what happens in the next four years
is in many ways out of his control.
He knows this. And that truth might
just be scarier and more intimidat-
ing than blindly placing your trust in
something beyond yourself.

According to a Jan. 18. article in the Detroit
Free Press, the new department will take
over the functions of the Office of Financial
and Insurance Regulation, which was previ-
ously under the Department of Licensing and
Regulatory affairs. The department will take
effect 60 days after the executive order was
signed. The creation of this new department
is a positive step for Michigan's economy.
Currently, the state's insurance and finan-
cial industries generate $9 billion in payroll
and employ about 150,000 people. Through
job creation and regulation of the insurance
industry, the implementation of the Depart-

ment of Insurance and Financial Services
should boost these numbers.
The new department is also a symbolic
gesture for the state. Large protests in Lan-
sing last month demonstrated that Michigan
residents aren't interested in more partisan
pushing in the'state legislature. The creation
of the department shows Snyder is thinking
beyond party rules and is willing to work with.
both sides of the aisle to improve the state's
economy. Moving past December's lame-duck
session, the governor should continue this
bipartisan approach to problem-solving and
engage both Democrats and Republicans.

Straighten priorities, not roads
Snyder misplaces $1 billion in Michigan roads
I n his State of the State address on Jan. 16, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
kept his goals low to the ground, proposing a $1.2-billion investment in
road repairs and updated infrastructure. While there's little doubt that
Michigan's roads are in poor shape and need improvement, the governor's
proposed investment places undue emphasis on traditional infrastructure
rather than more innovative transportation. Snyder's costly proposition also
overlooks nmore pressing services that desperately need funding - including

education.
In the days following his annual address,
Snyder took to the streets to gain support for
his infrastructure proposal, elaborating on
the details of his billion-dollar plan. Repair-
ing Michigan's bridges and highways are a
high priority in Snyder's proposal, which will
likely be funded through increases in vehicle
registration fees and the gas tax. "We need to
invest more in our roads," the governor said in
Wednesday's address. "It's time."
While the state's roads do need a facelift,
this high-priced investment overlooks the
more pressing need of public transportation
spending. On Jan. 19, Transportation Secre-
tary Ray LaHood announced federal support
for Detroit's planned light rail, promising $25
million for the M-1 project. While the federal
funding is valuable, the entire project - a 3.3-

mile rail along Woodward Avenue - is slated to
cost $140 million. Snyder's emphasis on roads,
rather than public transit, should be refocused
to connect Michigan's cities.
The large price tag attached to Snyder's road
project could also be appropriated to areas
more pressed for funding. Funding for higher
education was only briefly mentioned in the
governor's address. As state funding for public
colleges and universities continues to decline,
conversation needs to be directed towards sup-
porting Michigan's education after a decade of
divestment. Road infrastructure certainly war-
rants funding, but a $1.2-billion investment is
excessive in the face of rising tuition rates. If
Snyder is truly the "nerd" he claims to be, the
governor should redirect his attention from
roads to fostering innovation and learning.


DEREK WOLFE | VIWPOINT
God bless
I almost wish I hadn't stayed for Beyonce -
almost.
While not quite as congested as the 2009
inauguration that brought nearly two million
people to the National Mall, the 2013 inaugura-
tion and its 800,000 attendants was still a sight
to see. To put it simply, in about a seven-hour
span I was able to experience the best and worst
of the United States.
Bless the crowd.
Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) noted the
words of writer Alex Haley before President
Barack Obama took the oath: "Find the good
and praise it." So I will.
Standing within the peaceful mob can be
described as nearly euphoric. Where else in the
world can you find almost one million citizens
willingly watching a leader transfer power to
himself?Over the past couple ofyears,the news
has been filled with riots of angry people across
the globe wanting their leaders taken down -
not here.
How many other countries take a day to for-
get about the problems in politics and celebrate
its values? Not many. Though this day is for
Obama, he reminded me that it's really about
America, about "We, the people" - which he
used to begin many sections of his speech. And
seeing "the people" right in front of me made
his words come to life. It was powerful and
while hundreds of thousands waved red, white
and blue flags, I felt proud to be an American.
The camaraderie surrounding the event made
it a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
But in the same breath: Curse the crowd.
Trying to leave the Mall after Beyonce's
rousing rendition of "The Star Spangled Ban-
ner" was a nightmare, but still I have no regrets
about staying. The magic that had filled the air
throughout the ceremony disappeared faster

Beyonce
than the Russian spies who were probably
there. Well, maybe not quite as fast.
For some reason, security blocked off nearly
every viable pathway to all but one of the clos-
est subway stops. Combine that with the hun-
dreds of thousands of people who had no idea
where they were going- tourists, I guess - and
you've got yourself a disaster.
Everywhere I turned, I encountered an
officer who said we had to turn around and go
somewhere else. I asked one officer for direc-
tions but he dismissed me with a "Have a nice
day; keep going" and kept eating his snack. It
felt like a video game. Just mere minutes after
being inspired by our president's message on
how the future of United States is about us, I
had lost a little faith in us. Or at least our logisti-
cal abilities.
Regardless of the frustration in my depar-
ture, inauguration weekend in Washington
D.C. allowed me, and the crowd, to do what
most others around the country could not do:
experience democracy.
From visiting memorials and meeting my
congressman to the inauguration ceremony
itself, I was able to see that the leaders we've
elected do exist - it's not all a dream, even
though sometimes I wish it were.
While my feelings towards the crowd were
the strongest love-hate relationship I've experi-
enced, it made the whole event special. It's nice
to know that I'm not the only one who supports
Obama and the country as a whole. It felt like
a microcosm of America with people of all dif-
ferent races, creeds and backgrounds filling up
the mall.
I renewed my patriotism in America this
weekend. And my love for Beyonce. Bless her.
Derek Wolfe is an LSA freshman.

Four years ago today, I left
Washington D.C. after
watching the completion of
a dream I never
thought possible.
It was a journey
that no matter
how many times
I chanted "Yes
we can," deep
down inside, I
felt like it never
was going to PATRICK
actually come MAILLET
true. I thought
someone, some-
how would stop President Barack
Obama from taking the most sacred
of oaths. Four years ago, I left our
nation's capital feeling more hope-
ful and optimistic about both Amer-
ica's future and the state of our
democratic system as it once again
exemplified to the world the true
awesomeness of a peaceful transi-
tion of power.
ThoughI stood in the same spot as
I did four years ago, I now find myself
in a very different place. Facing new
obstacles, rising to new tasks, and
looking onto a brighter and more-
defined future:
On Monday, I sat on the steps
of the U.S. Capitol and once again
watched President Obama raise his
hand above the Bible as Chief Justice
John Roberts reiterated the presi-
dential oath of office. I listened as
Obama outlined the path of his next
four years as president and was left
speechless and teary-eyed by the end
of his address.
Once again, I find myself more
hopeful than ever about America's
future, but this time I feel less naive,
better focused and more aware of
not only the challenges that America
faces, but also the solutions that will
lift us over the obstacles of tomorrow.
President Obama began his sec-
ond term as president on Monday,
and he did so by telling America and
the rest of the world exactly what
he's looking to achieve within these
next four years.
After a campaign season that
never brought up the issue of global

warming, Obama at long last con-
fronted the ever-growing issues of
climate change. Many Obama sup-
porters, including myself, were
beginning to worry that his adminis-
tration had fallen prey to the age-old
theory that economic development
cannot be achieved hand-in-hand
with environmental protection.
Instead, Obama declared boldly
that our economy can and should be
built upon renewable energy and
a sustainable future. While our oil
addiction continues and fracking has
become a standard practice through-
out the country, we'll have to make
tough decisions with regards to trad-
ing economic gain for environmen-
tal protection. We can't forget our
responsibility to future generations,
and Obama made it clear that he
wasn't planning on doing so within
his second term..
Although he swore to pass serious
immigration reform within his first
term, Obama shelved this campaign
promise like many others, instead
passing much-needed economic leg-
islation and his signature healthcare
overhaul. Yesterday, Obama declared
that America must finally reform
its immigration policy along with
restructuring our visa system to keep
educated and motivated foreigners in
our country.
Finally, Obama confirmed what
he stated with his recent gun bill:
Gun control must be at the fore-
front of today's political agenda.
While he did not go into exacts, he
made it clear that a major gun con-
trol reform is coming and that the
deaths of 20 children in Newtown,
Conn. and countless other gun vic-
tims throughout the country will,
not have been in vain. .
From tax code overhaul and defi-
cit reduction to investing in educa-
tion and reforming voting rights,
Obama discussed a nultitude of
tasks that the United States faces.
However, although often criticized
for his professorial rhetoric and an
apparent lack of reality, Obama's
speech yesterday was extremely
realistic and bold, yet grounded.
Four years ago today, I felt

inspired and ready for the challeng-
es ahead of me. I was 17 years old,
didn't know what college I would
attend or what my future entailed.
I left Washington D.C. in 2009
inspired but unsure of what was
before me. America was at a simi-
lar point. Many Americans were
hopeful, yet our economy was in
free-fall. We were plagued with two
wars, and some people were begin-
ning to question the very future of
the United States.
I find myself
more hopeful
than ever about
America's future.
Four years later, I leave Washing-
ton D.C. once again, but this time
in a completely different way. I still
have much to learn and my future is
far from obvious, but I understand
what I have to do in order to achieve
my goals and career aspirations.
America is at a similar point. We
have seen the bottom and we have
rallied around crisis and catastro-
phe. Our future is still very unsure,
but now we know what needs to be
done; we know the sacrifices and
choices that must be made.
Four years from now, we'll watch
as the 45th president of the United
States is sworn in. Who knows
exactly where we will be as a coun-
try when this takes place? Regard-
less of whether we can predetermine
these exacts, we can definitely try
and predict. I believe America's
brightest days are before it. This
belief isn't based on blind optimism
or naive hope; it's based on the con-
viction of President Obama and the
long list of objectives laid out that if
achieved, will help guide this coun-
try into the future.

ADVISOR
From Page 1A
aftermath of the Sandy Hook
elementary school massacre
requires an immediate re-evalua-
tion of the core values and moral
compass of the nation.
"Itis no longer a choice between
non-violence and violence in this
world; it is non-violence or non-
existence," Jones said, paraphras-
ing King's words to address to the
December shooting in Newtown,
Conn.
He then mentioned that con-
tinuing King's legacy of non-vio-
lence may be the most difficult
duty he gave the nation. He spoke
of gun violence being a critical
issue facing the nation's youths in
particular.
"What we (give) and what our
world gives our youth today is vio-
lence," Jones said.
Jones also spoke at length
about the way in which some peo-
ple and institutions debase the
memory of King by distorting the

meaning and content if his teach-
ings and speeches by fitting his
views to their own agendas. He
accused the National Rifle Asso-
ciation, of which such manipula-
tions - the group is holding a gun
appreciation day during the week
commemorating the 84th birth-
day of King.
In addition, Jones said without
the collective work of those who
transformed the United States
politically through the Civil
Rights Movement, Obama's 2008
election wouldn't be possible. He
ended his speech in noting that
he is frequently asked whom he
thinks is most like Martin Luther
King Jr. today.
"I answer them by asking a
rhetorical question: Who today
is most like Michelangelo?"
Jones said. "Who today is most
like Beethoven? Galileo? Shake-
speare? No one."
LSA sophomore Cecilia
Dumouchel and LSA senior
Andrew Kalenkiewicz both
decided to come to the event
because of the personal connec-

tion Jones had with King. They
commented positively about
Jones' incorporation of recent,
real-life events and gun-violence
commentary into his speech.
"I was totally mesmer-
ized through the entire thing,"
Dumouchel said. "I think the way
that he applied these notions of
the past in such a real and vibrant
way to these immense issues we
have today was kind of refresh-
ing."
They both agreed that Martin
Luther King Jr. Day was a time for
reflection on what race and dis-
crimination issues still remain in
U.S. society.
"It's a day to sit back and reflect
on partially the problems that our
nation has faced and how those
problems how they manifested
themselves in the past and how
they manifest themselves today,"
Kalenkiewicz said, "And also
it serves as a reminder for how
much of an impact an individual
can have on society, everything
that can be achieved by one great
man."

DAVIS
From Page 1A
Davis acknowledged that
this particular Martin Luther
King Jr. Day was one that was
endowed with heavy symbol-
ism because it fell on the second
inauguration of the first black
president and occurred 150 years
after the Emancipation Procla-
mation.
Having served 18 months
in prison, Davis said she is
particularly invested in the
understanding of the prison
industrial complex's roots in rac-
ism and the rapid privatization
of the expanding incarcerated
population.
"When you look at the emer-
gence of prisons," Davis said, "(it
is) very much connected to (the)
development of the capitalist
system and the development of
slavery."
Davis said a U.S. inmate popu-
lation of 2.5 million has created a
prison system with gross inequi-
ties like a disproportionally large
population of black prisoners.
"Prison is an institution
that devours people who have
become part of a surplus popula-
tion," Davis said. "It allows you
to ignore the problems that put
those individuals in that position
in the first place."
Davis noted that, despite hav-
ing a black president, racism
remains ingrained in the fabric

of U.S. society. She added that
racism and other injustices in
the United States have led her to
question the capitalist economic
system.
"What this means is that we
have a lot of work to do with
respect to rooting out racism in
this country," Davis said. "We
have got to begin to ask about the
whole society."
Students Organizing Against
Prisons, a group that advocates
against the prison-industrial
complex, was one of the many
groups that worked to bring
Davis to the University.
Alex Kulick, SOAP mem-
ber and LSA senior, said he was
excited to see students come out
to see Davis speak and engage in
a conversation about race.
"(She) is one of those speak-
ers and thinkers who can hold
us accountable to what (this con-
versation) really means," Kulick
said. "(She makes us) progress
forward and radically question
our assumptions about societ-
ies."
Kulick said Davis has inspired
his work with SOAP.
"Her work has really com-
bined everything that we stand
for as student activists," Kulick
said. "(She) really bring(s) a crit-
ical lens to activism."
LSA sophomore Christiana
Allen echoed Kulick's senti-
ments.
"We need to really work on
(these) problems so that we can

become better as a whole in
America," Allen said.
Darlene Nichols, the Univer-
sity librarian for Diversity Ini-
tiatives and Programs, worked
on one of the committees that
helped bring Davis to campus.
She said Davis's positions made
her an attractive speaker for the
Martin Luther King, Jr. sympo-
sium.
,"(It is important) to bring
someone who is thought-pro-
voking, who can get the commu-
nity motivated and energized,"
Nichols said.
Nichols said she remembers
growing up when Davis was
an important figure in the civil
rights community. For her,
Davis was an important sub-
ject of conversation during her
childhood.
"This is really an incredible
moment to bring my childhood
into the present and meet some-
one who is so prominent in my
memory and my history of black
social movements," Nichols
said.
Nichols added that she was
proud of students' attendance of
the event.
"Seeing young 'people still
engaged and interested and
wanting to hear and learn more
about what is going in the world
... it is why we are here," Nichols
said.

Open-mindedness topic
of convocation remarks

Robbins says
sterotypes emerge
from daily life
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
Students, faculty, staff and
members of the public gathered
on Monday in Rackham Audito-
rium for the- 2013 Business and
Finance Martin Luther King, Jr.
Day Convocation, "Imagine the
Possibilities. What if?"
Steve Robbins, the keynote
speaker for the event, immigrat-
ed to the United States in 1970
with his mother to escape the
perils and upheaval of war-torn
Vietnam. After suffering from
racial discrimination,. Robbins
now speaks publicly about the
challenges and benefitbof build-
ing a more open-minded society.
"We've 'been addressing
something we thought was the
problem (close-mindedness) and
we haven't gotten very far," Rob-
bins said. "Diversity is not the
problem - closed-mindedness
is.
Robbins said implicit preju-
dice is the main challenge fac-
ing the current generation of
Americans. Although many
people do not actively attempt to
be closed-minded, stereotypes
emerge through both media and
daily interactions.
"All we have to do is live in
an environment that gives us
limited narrow messages about
people," Robbins said. "Our
brain absorbs those messages
and creates mental models for
us ... in the same way it absorbs
lyrics to a song."
Robbins argued that much of
the closed-mindedness preva-
lent in society stems from
human's natural, cautious reac-

tion to unknown situations or
interactions.
"That mechanism is still
inside us today," Robbins said.
"Long ago it was about physi-
cal safety; today it is more about
emotional comfort."
"Once your brain locks onto a
pattern, it basically stops criti-
cally thinking. It lets the pat-
tern's momentum take it to the
next step," Robbins said. "You
will take very little information
about people and your brain
will form a pattern for you and
use that pattern to submit quick
assessments and judgments."
While these quick judgments
were useful when trying to avoid
predators, Robbins questioned
the impact on modern society.
Snap judgments can be harmful
toward certain groups.
Robbins approaches many
of his studies from both a sci-
entific and social perspective.
While he obtained his doctorate
in communications, much of his
current research includes the
biology involved in the brain's
decision-making processes.
Although the brain accounts
for only two percent of the
body's mass, it consumes almost
20 percent of the body's total
energy, Robbins said. This ener-
gy consumption is increased
when the brain is exposed to
unfamiliar stimuli. In these sit-
uations, the brain experiences
cognitive dissonance.
"When we get into a state of
cognitive dissonance or cogni-
tive discomfort, we want to get
out of it very quickly - we're
motivated to get out of it very
quickly," Robbins said.
When someone is put into a
new situation, his or her brain
is given two options: accept or
reject. Although acceptance can
make others feel much more
included and welcome, Robbins

noted that people do not tend to
react in this manner.
"Blocking - being closed-
minded - is a great way to get
rid of our dissonance, but (it's
not) a very good way to learn,"
Robbins said.
Robbins concluded his presen-
tation by attempting to motivate
the audience to seek change in
their own communities, specifi-
cally calling on them to be more
open to accepting outsiders.
"Fundamentally, for me, this
work is about caring for people,
and the true measure about
whether you are a caring person
is not how well you can care for
your friends ... but how well you
care for strangers and outsiders,"
Robbins said.
"Be a path-maker, not a path-
blocker."
The event was organized
by the, Business and finange
Diversity Committee and co-
sponsored by several Univer-
sity departments and groups.
Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and
chief financial officer, discussed
the University's involvement in
this event during his opening
remarks.
"Our commitment is not just to
hold this single event each year.
In fact, it is an ongoing commit-
ment to organizational action, to
education, to awareness rising
and to celebration," Slottow said.
"Respect for diversity is one of
our eight organizational values."
LSA sophomore Andrew Ste-
vens said he found Robbins's
personal story and theories
intriguing.
"I made sure to look around at
all the events that were going on
around campus today because it
only happens once a year," Ste-
vens said. "You might as well
get out and see something that
might change your mind."

'Mama' twists, and.turns

Del Toro-produced
film thrills with
unpredictable plot
By ANDREW MCCLURE
Daily ArtsWriter
Any old cinephile or casual
moviegoer has a pretty solid idea
of what to expect when stroll-
ing into a film
like "Mama." B
And that's pre-
cisely why the M
theater was
25-percent full At Quality16
- mostly con- and Rave
sisting of ston-
ers and those Universal
who inces-
santly sniffle. Surprisingly, this
one manages to beguile, irk and
anger, all for its own emotionally
manipulative agenda. Without
a doubt, the script plagues itself
with throwback cliches, butinso-
far"Mama" doesn't die from said
plague..By the credits, the mis-
steps stand out like a sore thumb,
but the dense tale is very much
intact.
.- ookie director Andres Mus-
chietti takes an ambitious stab at
arthouse-y suspense. It follows
a newly fatherless pair of young
sisters, their incredible survival
in the wilderness and the abrupt
reacquainting with their uncle
(Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, "Head-
hunter'") and his girlfriend

(Jessica Chastain, "Zero Dark
Thirty").
The girls' transition back into
residential life is far from, say,
Gary Busey returning to his ori-
gin in the catacombs. The elder
girl (first-timer Megan Char-
pentier)-sort of has the hang of
it, recalling most vocabulary
and being (barely) emotionally
responsive. The younger (rela-
tively unknown Isabelle Nalisse),
on the other hand, is freakishly
animalistic, from galloping on all
fours to eating from doggie dish-
es. But one thing keeps these girls
mysteriously in line: Mama.
We learn the girls, upon los-
ing their father in the sub-zero
winter years ago, created a
projection, an abstraction, of a
would-be mother. To be blunt,
Mama doesn't take kindly to the
cool uncle and his punk-rocker
girlfriend. Envy ensues.
Don't be afraid, you can laugh
in "Mama." That's normal. It's
OK to shake your head at Chas-
tain's The Misfits T-shirt and her
contrived black-licorice affinity.
Seriously. You may even question
why you're in the theater when
the onsereen lights flicker with
indecision every three scenes.
And please, for the love of God,
guffaw hard when the younger
sister unthinkably reminds you
of Gollum in every sense. The
point is that these moments are
indeed transient - a very brief
departure from the yellow brick

"

'Oh no, Olive Garden's closed!
road. The laughable stuff doesn't
bog down, but rather ups our
attention span for the real story.
Some hag librarian, who
probably was more important
than initially thought, tells the
investigating shrink, "Ghosts
are an emotion condemned to
right a wrong." This plot point
accredits Mama herself and her
fucked-up motive behind indoc-
trinating the girls. Propelled
by this, Chastain impressively
goes from indifferent Heineken-
guzzler to protective mother
figure. And it's great. Chastain
has proven herself in different
projects recently, so the stage
comfort remains strong.
Truth be told, audiences like
to identify with characters (or
even the camera for that mat-
ter). A big rub with "Mama" is

its failure to root for anyone in
particular until the final 30 min-
utes. Too many teams form and
their interrelatedness blurs. But
that's part of the fun.
Another fun piece is the lens-
ing: An ever-so-patient camera
allows objects to invade the
frame instead of the other way
around. Peerless pans and tanta-
lizing tilts make way for unpre-
dictability in every scene.
Given four days post-screen-
ing, when you're done joking
about Mama's need for a gua-
camole-looking facial, you'll
appreciate what you saw. It's
about nature and nurture, two
mutually exclusive castles, and
envy connecting them as the
moat. It doesn't matter who
wins because, in the end, the
script holds.

Either he could have farted or he could have farted.

Too much
synth, not
enough riot in
latest release.
On "For Once," Miles's vocals
are grating and constrained
against obnoxiously loud, pop
instrumentation, resulting in
a track that would fit nicely
with the faux-doo-wop dreck
of Bruno Mars. When strings
appear in the song's second half,
they are completely out of place
and submerged under synths and
a drum-machine beat - symbolic
of the band's abandonment of its
once-signature sound.
Without a doubt the worst song
Ra Ra Riot has ever made, "What
I Do For U," is an atrocious,
one minute and 44 second-long
assault on the ears - containing
a nauseatingly basic and bass-
heavy beat and piercingly auto-
tuned, falsetto vocals. Tracks
like "Binary Mind" and "That
Much," on the other hand, are
reminiscent of the '80s vibe that
the band established in the dance
tracks of its first two albums, but
ultimately, they also succumb to
overwhelming synths and a lack
of noteworthy melody.
As a whole, the production
on Beta Love is incredibly lack-
luster. A novice beatsmith could
have easily produced songs like
"When I Dream" and "Wilder-
ness" on Fruity Loops, and over-
all, the sonic foundation of this
album is a far cry from the inno-
vative baroque pop of The Rhumb
Line and The Orchard.
Please understand that this
criticism of synths in the context
of Beta Love does not translate to
a blanket criticism of synth-pop
at large.

Finding little
satire in 'Django'

VIDEO GAME REVIEW
Animated magic in'Kuni'

Have you ever told a joke
boy, you are funny!
- only to realize that
your audience doesn't quite get
it? Sure, they're laughing. He's
slappinghis
knees, she's
tossingher
head back
with glee
and shaking
a finger in
your direction
(you are so BRIANNE
hi-larious!). JOHNSON
But the back
row - heck,
the whole theater - has missed
the punchline, swinging fists
into space, wild and blind and
amused.
This was my experience
watching Quentin Tarantino's
"Django Unchained."
But I'm no comedian, just
an eager viewer camped out in
the last aisle of my hometown
theater on Christmas night.
"Dude, this movie's going to
be fucking awesome. Tarantino
is the man."
Five friends surround me: all
male, all old high-school chums,
all slurping the salt and butter
off their thumbs. Oh, and we're
all white. Not that it matters,
right? Love is blind to color, and
so is the audience of this dim
theater.
But let's fast forward to
over two hours later. Over two
hours of aesthetic, comedic,
dramatic, gory and DiCaprio-
tastic brilliance later, I am in the
backseat of a '91 Honda Civic,
wiping out brain cells with each
thud of my forehead against the
window. Shockingly detailed
penises are scrawled across the
foggy glass like cave paintings.
I sigh.
I am frustrated.
"Is it weird that all I want to
do is say ni**a' now?" the driver
asks with a laugh.
"Leo is so getting an Oscar for
that. That shit was insane."
"Brianne, what's your
problem? It's a movie - it has no
point! It's just for entertainment,
jeez."
Now, weeks later, I address the
above statements for (at least)
two reasons: First, His Highness
Leonardo DiCaprio has not
received a nomination from the
Academy. Can we please have a
moment of silence?
Second, this heaping mess of
my friends' words parading as a
post-film discussion is very, very
wrong.
But who am I, perhaps no
more justified than Calvin
Candie's clueless, white southern
belle of a sister, to speak of
racism? Who am I to spout my
sympathies for a whole race of
people representedby a couple
of characters in a glamourized
western flick? I don't know. I
was one of 50 people in that
theater on Christmas night. One
of many who heard members of
the audience stifle their giggles
like guilty children every time
Samuel L. Jackson opened his
mouth. Isn't that enough?
Hey, I can appreciate
comedy. I'm satire's biggest fan,
with a sign-my-infant-son's-
forehead love for irony and self-
deprecation. Needless to say,

I believe - in all my potential
delusion - that I am familiar
enough with satiric comedy
to enjoy or, at least, recognize
it. Jokes are not the problem.
(C'mon, I promise!).
RA RA RIOT
From Page 6A
Many bands and artists have
certainly embraced an electronic
sound and flourished in it. But in
a synth-pop world where groups
like Passion Pit are producing
catchier songs and artists like
Toro Y Moi are crafting groovier
albums, it's hard for this elec-
tronic Ra Ra Riot album to feel
up to snuff.
With a more artful approach
to auto-tune and production (and
maybe some more strings), Ra Ra
Riot could certainly thrive in this
genre in the future, but for now,
we are left with Beta Love and its
dud-ly mediocrity.

The issue is that my friends
weren't laughing atfthe tongue-
in-cheek racism. They weren't
guffawing at the laughable
ignorance and transparent
hospitality of "Django"'s racists.
My neighbors weren't
laughing at the racists. They
were laughing with them.
What's the difference, you
ask. Maybe there isn't one, I
answer. After all, as my friend
said, maybe a movie is mere
entertainment, and we're all
wasting our time studying film
for deeper meaning. Wouldn't
that be funny?
Is it amatter of selective
perception? Do we, as viewers,
let our critical guards down as
we raise palms full of popcorn to
our mouths?
Maybe you chuckledbecause
you can't resist agood ol'
stereotype. Maybe you laughed
because Jonah Hill and his
band of buffoons, hooded like
the KKK in cowboy boots, was,
y'know, funny. But why did you
nudge your neighbor and smile
when slaves were called crude
names? Whipped? When the
head house slave referred to a
fellow black man as "boy" and
refused to acknowledge his
humanity?
Racism is
exploited rather
than explored.
Listen, I admit that, whether
a person catches the implicit
humor of some satirical joke
is, in the big scheme of movie-
related things, not a tragic issue.
However, for those who haven't
been subject to racism (of all
colors and ethnicities), it's just
another form of entertainment.
It's an anecdote ina comedian's
lineup, a lyric, a theme of next
week's episode and an internet
meme.
I've heard that acknowledging
racism, even in an ironic way,
can take the power out of it.
After all, slavery and segregation
are behind us - the wound has
healed! Hasn't it?
So, what's the big deal?
"Tarantino isn't trying to make
a point," myfriend said that night
at the theater, "It's just a movie.
You're supposed to laugh."
Maybe I've missed
something. Have I subscribed to
the wrongbrand of humor?
Wait, aren't I watching "This
is 40"? Oh. Well, that explains
a lot,
Johnson lost her sense of
humor. To help her, e-mail

Gameplay and score
take 'Ni no' to
new heights
By JULIAN AIDAN
Daily Arts Writer
It's rare that an exceed-
ingly - high-quality piece of
work reminds adults that it's
all right to be
a kid again.
"Wall-E" pro-
vided adorable, Ni no Kuni:
abstract char-
acters, while Wrathof the
"Toy Story 3" White Wtch
blended the
familiar cast of Playstation 3
action figures Studio Ghibli
and company
with a healthy
dose of nostalgia. "Ni no Kuni:
Wrath of the White Witch" cre-
ates a world that evokes wide-
eyed wonderment from players,
inviting them into a bubbly, liv-
ing and tangibly real world that
makes playing feel more like an
exploration of the favorite films
of years long past.
The game follows the story
of Oliver, your run-of-the-mill,
suspenders-wearing 13-year-
old boy from some generically
named city somewhere in some
place. Where he's from is less
important than where he goes:
Following a tragic accident, he
finds out that he is a wizard and
embarks on a quest to restore
things to their former, happier
state.
Guided by Lord High Lord
of the Fairies, former doll Mr.
Drippy, and joined by a cast of
palpably real allies and ene-
mies, Oliver bounces between
his world and a parallel one to
restore damage done by Shadar,
a tentacle-faced Djinn with a
penchant for breaking hearts.
The player's goal is to mend the
hearts of cursed individuals in
this other world, giving them

booster shots of Love or Enthu-
siasm or whatever else they
may be missing. Each character
in this parallel world is tied to
their soulmate in Oliver's, shar-
ing various similarities - the
Cat King in the other world is a
fat tabby in Oliver's, while Oli-
ver's mom is a renowned Sage in
the other world and so on.
"Ni no Kuni" owes its bril-
liant, animated film aesthet-
ics to animation giant Studio
Ghibli ("Spirited Away") and
game developer Level-5 ("Pro-
fessor Layton" series), which
worked together to create an
atmosphere that is indiscernible
from the lush, vibrant settings
in Ghibli's films. The voice act-
ing, available both in English
and Japanese, is incredible.
Each character has a distinct
personality and everyone from
the shopkeepers to the titular
antagonist, the White Witch, is
privy to beautifully written dia-
logue.
Gameplay is where "Ni no
Kuni" really shines. Aside from

the 'fact that the game is gor-
geous, immersive and generally
exceptional, the game strikes
a balance between instanced
monster fights and Pokemon-
style monster capturing and
battling. Oliver and his pals can
fight on their own, but their
familiars - cute but fierce enti-
ties controlled by individual
wizards - tend to be handier in
battle.
Each party member can have
up to three familiars available
to them at a time, with one out
on the front lines and the other
two waiting for their share of
the fight.
Players can obtain and train
animals out in the wild to use
in the future, offering comple-
tionists a fun diversion from the
wealth of side quests and bounty
hunting while not making it
necessary for progression.
While the combat isn't neces-
sarily intuitive at first, the brief
stop-and-go of the action lets
players breathe in otherwise
stressful engagements. Boss

fights are a huge affair, with
some of the creatures greatly
outsizing the diminutive pro-
tagonist and his even smaller
familiars.
Also incredible is the game's
soundtrack. Written by Joe
Hisaishi - responsible for the
incredible scores of many Studio
Ghibli movies - and performed
by the Tokyo Philharmonic
Orchestra, the game's heart-
string-pulling conflicts and the
childlike amazement shared by
both the protagonist and the
player are brought to life by the
expertly crafted musical cre-
scendos and climaxes.
"Ni no Kuni" is an unbeliev-
ably great game, providing a
solid role-playing experience in
a universe that doesn't rely on
cutting-edge, hyper-realistic
gore or shock tactics to provide
a memorable experience. With
no obvious flaws and a slew of
positives, "Ni no Kuni" hits all
the right notes for gainers of all
kinds.

Wolverines drop
contest of last two
Big Ten unbeatens
By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Ediotr
After Purdue lost to Iowa on
Sunday evening, the scene was
set for the only two undefeated
teams left in the Big Ten to face
off in a battle for conference
supremacy. But by the end of
Monday's affair between No. 23
Michigan and No. 8 Penn State,
only one team would remain
standing without a blemish on its
record.
That team was not Michigan.
The Lady Lions topped the Wol-
verines, 59-49, and now sit atop

the Big Ten standings.
Michigan (4-1 Big Ten, 15-3
overall) battled against Penn
State's aggressive defense, but it
couldn't maintain senior guards
Maggie Lucas and Alex Bent-
ley. The Lady Lions (5-0, 15-2)
declawed the Wolverines' persis-
tent attempts to fight back inthe
second half despite getting into
early foul trouble.
"We went against a top 10
team tonight and everybody
that was watching here and
everybody watching around the
country I think now believes,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "That was the big ques-
tion, 'Is Michigan for real?' And I
think everybody got an opportu-
nity tonight to see that Michigan
is for real."
In a defensive battle that

resulted in poor shooting from
both teams, Lucas led Penn
State's offensive attack with 19
points. Bentley, whose impact
was felt on both ends of the floor,
finished with 16 points end five
steals.
"You see how many points
they scored and you think we did
a crummy job, but then you look
at their shooting percentages and
we actually did a pretty decent
job," Barnes Arico said.
Senior guard Kate Thomp-
son struggled from the field all
night,shooting 3 for 16 with nine
points. In her absence, senior
forward Rachel Sheffer domi-
nated in the paint, contributing
a double-double on 20 points and
10 rebounds. Senior guard Jenny
Ryan added seven points and six
assists, though she struggled to

raight
make only 3 of 10 shots from the
field.
The firsi matchup between the
two teams this year had a post-
season feeling throughout. With
emotions running high, the Wol-
verines' tenacity was evident as it
dove for loose balls and retained
the tempo to hold the Lady Lions
scoreless through the first 3 min-
utes of play.
Michigan started the game in
a 2-3 zone, causing nine turn-
overs early. Penn State attempted
to counter with full court pres-
sure out of the starting gate,
something the Wolverines strug-
gled with against Northwestern,
and aptly forced nine turnovers.

ICE HOCKEY
Sweep eludes
Wolverines.
against Lakers

Burke highlighted on 'The Journey'

-On Friday, hockey
earned first road
win of the year
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
SAULT STE. MARIE - On the
same night the NHL returned
to the world following 116 days
without a game, the Michigan
hockey team sought to end a
drought of its own and find the
weekend sweep that it had failed
to collect all season.
Despite overcoming one
obstacle and notching their first
road win of the season the night
before, the Wolverines were
unable to finish out the weekend
on top, falling to Lake Superior
6 State in a 3-2 decision on Satur-
day night.
It was already a tough pill to
swallow, but even more disheart-

ening considering that Michigan
coach Red Berenson believed
that the Wolverines were playing
at the highest standard they have
all season.
"(The team) had probably
their best weekend of the year in
terms of commitment and work
ethic and playing the way they
needed to play," Berenson said.
"We had a good result last night
and not a good result tonight. It's
too bad that everything's based
on results - our team laid it on
the line and they weren't good
enough tonight."
Michigan's power play showed
its colors early in the first period
- though unable to capitalize on
a 5-on-3 advantage, freshman
forward Boo Nieves scored in
the waning seconds of the second
power play.
That momentum appeared as

Sophomore
re-hashes his
decision to return
to Ann Arbor
By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
On a darkened court at the
Crisler Center, Trey Burke drib-
bles a ball in and out of his legs,
surrounded by black.
As the sophomore point guard
discusses his decision to forego
the NBA Draft and return to
Ann Arbor for his sophomore
year, the camera pans over the
darkened court.
Burke, at the center, is the
lone source of movement.
He talks about how much he
has grown as a point guard, and
how important it was for him to
return for his sophomore year at
Michigan. Then, the screen cuts
to Michigan coach John Beilein,
who provides his own take on
Burke's decision.
"I'm sure there are some days
he thought it might be best for
him to go (to the NBA)," Beilein
said on the show. "But I know

SPORTSTUESDAY COLUMN
Two weeks ago, Jim Har-
baugh arranged for
small laminated sheet to
be hung above every San Fran-
cisco 49ers locker.
Players from different decades,
from Randy Moss to Patrick Wil-
lis to Colin
Kaepernick,
peered above
their lockers
after ateam
meeting to
investigate.
Each sheet
was different. STEPHEN J.
The white
plaques had NESBITT
each player's
recruiting
rankings, college logo and a
grainy photo from high school.
Some, like Moss, had No.1
rankings splashed across the
sheet. Others, like Ray McDon-
ald, were nobodies, unranked
and forgotten. Harbaugh asked
only that the 49ers look back at
themselves and remember.
"Coach really wants us to tap
into what we wanted to be at that
time," safety Donte Whitner told
the Los Angeles Times. "When
you look at this picture, it's like,
'At this moment, what did I want
to be?"'
What they wanted to be was
never in question. They wanted
to be champions.
On Feb. 3, the 49ers will battle
the Baltimore Ravens in Super
Bowl XLVII in New Orleans. On
one sideline, Jim Harbaugh. On
the other, John Harbaugh.
The 49ers are right where they
want to be.
Harbaugh never made a lami-
nated sheet for himself. "They
didn't have the Internet back in
1982 that I'm aware of," he told
reporters with a laugh. But he
surely knows the answer to the
question he asked his team: What
didyou want to be?
Jim Harbaugh wanted to be a
champion.
He spent much of his child-
hood inAnn Arbor, around the
bend from Ann Arbor Pioneer
High School, where he and John
both starred on the dusty prep
football field across the intersec-
tion from Michigan Stadium.
The sons of a journeyman
assistant coach, Jack Harbaugh,
who found his footing as an
assistant coach under Bo Schem-
bechler at Michigan, the boys

The Making of a Champion

were born to coach. When their
father accepted a defensive coor-
dinator position at Stanford in
1980, the boys parted ways, John
to play defensive back at Miami
(Ohio), Jim to finish his last two
years of high school in Palo Alto,
Calif.'
Hold on. You know what hap-
pens next, sure, but just hold on.
Step back and think of what you
know about Jim Harbaugh right
now. What is he? Who is he?
Today, Jim is one of the fieriest
head coaches in the NFL. He's
gruff, he's tough, he's aticking
time bomb on the sideline. He
has an edge. Hisbrother is noth-
ing like that. His father really
wasn't either.
Jim was the son of a coach, the
brother of a coach, the brother-
in-law of a coach. Even one of his
babysitters was a coach.
But it came from somewhere
else, somewhere beyond the
reaches of the Harbaugh coach-
ing tree. If we're on the same
page here, you're thinking one
thing: It all comes back to Bo. It
always does.
Never a touted recruit despite
his peerless coaching pedigree,
Jim almost didn't return to Ann
Arbor. He isn't'your prototypical
'Michigan Man,' you see; maybe
it's hard to cultivate that death-
less loyalty when your father
coaches at five different schools
since you entered grade school.
No, Jim didn't come back for
the block 'M,' or for the winged
helmet or for the maize and blue.
He came back for Bo.
"I really didn't think I'd be
back here," Jim admitted in 1985.
"But, when I came here for my
visit, sitting in Bo's office, he said
he wanted me and I said, 'OK, I'll
come.' It was as easy as that."
It makes sense, really. Jim was
raised to understand the value of
a coach, a maker of men. And Bo
was the epitome of coach. He was
fiery, he had sideline antics. He
sure had an edge, too.
"He always seemed larger
than life to me. I put him on
a pedestal," Jim said after his
senior season. "Now, I view Bo
more as a human being. He's both
a coach and a friend.
"I still realize, though, that I'm
playing for a living legend."
He liked Schembechler's
style, his tenacity, his demand
for excellence. He once told the
story of when he overslept a team
meeting by five minutes during
his freshman year.
"Bo was mad," Jim recalled.

he still bested the Badgers, 20-14.
Heck, even their sister, Joani,
married a coach - Indiana bas-
ketball coach Tom Crean.
The Harbaughs learned from
the best, taught by legendary
coaches from the beginning.
There's no reason to think
they would have ever failed.
And they haven't. Failure isn't in
their pedigree. No NFL team has
missed the playoffs with a Har-

Despite Graj ales, Iowa dominates
struggling Wolverines at home

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Writer
The dejected faces that lined
the Michigan sideline said it
all. A Friday night that started
with an excited sellout crowd
packing Cliff Keen Arena ended
before all the wrestling even
finished, as the 18th-ranked
Wolverine'wrestling team (0-3
Big Ten, 6-4 overall) was-blown
out by No. 4 Iowa, 33-10.
Michigan - with the excep-
tions of 149-pound redshirt
junior Eric Grajales, who
earned a major decision over
his opponent, and heavyweight
fifth-year senior Ben Apland,
who earned a medical forfeit
over his opponent - struggled
all night against a dominant,
experienced Iowa team.
"We've got to learn some-
thing from this, that's for
sure," said Michigan coach Joe
McFarland. "We've got to get
better."
The Hawkeyes' lineup was

little bit better at," McFarland
said. "We've got to keep plow-
ing forward and keep our nose
to the grindstone."
Against Iowa, Michigan's
lineup featured five wrestlers
who either had never started in
Big Ten competition before this
season or who are not a regular
part of the lineup and started
because of injuries, making the
adjustment to facing a top team
like the Hawkeyes very diffi-
cult.
The inexperienced Wolver-
ines provided brief glimpses
of hope on a night where little
seemed to exist for Michigan.
One example was 141-pound
redshirt junior Mike Hillock,
who wentinto his match against
No. 9 Mark Ballweg having

competed in only one dual meet
this season for the Wolverines.
Hillock provided a jolt through
the packed arena with an early
takedown to take the lead in
the match. But as the trend of
the night continued for Michi-
gan, Hillock failed to capital-
ize on a near fall opportunity
to pin Ballweg, who responded
to a deficit at the end of the first
period by taking a lead in the
second period and never look-
ing back on his way to an 18-10
major decision. The lone Michi-
gan wrestler to capitalize on the
opportunities given to him on
Friday was Grajales.
Ranked No. 11 in his weight
class, Grajales continued to
serve as a steady hand for the
Wolverines, garnering three

takedowns and a near-fall while
accumulating 2:17 of riding time
on his way to a 12-3 major deci-
sion. The win improved Grajales
to 3-0 in Big Ten dual meets this
season.
As a team, Michigan can only
continue to work hard until
wrestlers get healthy and gain
experience.
"We have these last two
months of the season to figure
out what we're doing wrong,
tweak it, get better," Grajales
said. "And hopefully finish out
the season (well)."
The Wolverines will look
for their first Big Ten dual-
meet victory of the season next
Sunday as they take on No. 21
Northwestern at Cliff Keen
Arena.

said Penn State coach Coquese
Washington. "We just didn't
want to give them open shots."
While Ryan strived to pres-
sure Lucas throughout the
game, Lucas had her way on
the floor with 12 points in the
first half. Sheffer dominated
the paint for the Wolverines
with 10 points in the first half,
though senior forward Nikki
Greene controlled the glass
with seven rebounds.
Thompson started off hot,
nailing two three-pointers to
start the game, though she fin-
ished the half shooting 2-for-
7 due to Bentley's limiting
defense.
"We were trying to spy,
especially Kate Thompson,"
Lucas said. "She' s a great
shooter so we were trying to
spy her."
Sheffer led an 8-2 run mid-
way through the first half to
put Michigan within one point.
After nailing a 3-pointer and
two layups, Sheffer then took a
charge to ignite the Wolverine
defense. Penn State recovered
with an 8-1run of its own going
into the break, leading the
Wolverines 32-24.
"I thought Rachel did a tre-
mendous job inside and showed
a great toughness about her
tonight," Barnes Arico said.
"She wasn't getting her shots
to fall, but she really did a great
job. Greene has weight, height,
everything on her and Rachel
really held her own and got her
into foul trouble."
Michigan opened the second
half with eight straight points,
but Lucas would respond with
her team in foul trouble. Green
picked up a flagrant foul to
open the second period, her
third personal of the game,
forcing herto the bench early.
The Wolverines were able to
slow down the clock as it found
itself in the bonus more than
midway through the second

period. Freshman guard Madi-
son Ristovski's free throws
were valuable in cutting the
difference and bringing Michi-
gan within a point of the lead.
After a back-and-forth bat-
tle, the Lady Lions pulled away
on an 8-3 run that gave them a
nine-point lead. The Wolver-
ines struggled to recover and
shot poorly down the stretch
despite Lucas on the bench.
In the end, Penn State's tena-
cious defense and rapid scoring
was too much for Michigan to
handle in the final minutes of
the game as the Wolverines
conceded their first conference
loss.
"The thing about Penn State
is that they score in bunches,"
Ryan said. "I think it was just
one of those games where their
runs just came at a bad time for
us."
Michigan was outrebound-
ed in the game, 41-34, yet the
teams finished even on turn-
overs with 15 a piece.
"I mean we average about 15
(turnovers a game) and you're
playing a team like Penn State
that presses you the entire
game and forces teams to 25
turnovers a game," Barnes
Arico said. "So if we can keep
it to under 15, we think we put
ourselves in a really good posi-
tion in the game."
The season is far from over
for the Wolverines, who still
have the opportunity to record
one of the best seasons in pro-
gram history. Michigan has
been resilient through its first
five conference games, but will
need to continue to improve
if they hope to remain in the
national spotlight.
"Our league is incredibly
strong, and tonight we faced
the top of our league. But
there is no bottom, so if you
don't bring your game night in
and night out you can lose to
any opponent in our league,"
Barnes Arico said. "We have a
short turn around, but this was
a great Penn State (team) we
faced tonight."

FELDMAN

house team of the Big Ten in No.
8 Penn State. It was a chance to
show the nation and the Big Ten
that the Wolverines were not a
young newlywed couple looking
,for attention. They were here to
make a long lasting impression.
Something old
"This senior class is coming
off of three years of things that
hadn't been done in a longtime,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico at Michigan media day
in October. "We owe it to them
to make it the bestyear we can
make it."
And all season longthe Wol-
verines have done that. The
five-member senior class of
guard Jenny Ryan and forwards
Rachel Sheffer, Kate Thompson,
Nya Jordan and Sam Arnold
have carried the scoring burden
due to the team's lack of depth.
The quintet has accounted for
80 percent of the team's scor-
ing, with the trio of Thompson,
Sheffer and Ryan averaging 15.8,
12.4 and 11.4 points per game,
respectively.
Scoring has not been the only
area thatthe senior class has kept
steady for Michigan, as the group
has averaged over 23 rebounds
per game, including 6.1 for Jor-
dan and 5.8 for Sheffer.
Butthe most outstanding
statistic for any senior and any
player on the team has been
Thompson's shooting from
beyond the arc. Through 17
games, she has averaged 3.88
triples per game and is on the
path to break the school record
for 3-pointers in a season. Com-
ing off a game in which she made
a school-record seven 3-pointers,
she would be as important as
ever in Michigan's game against
Penn State.
Something new

For a team coming off its
first NCAA Tournament in 11
years, winning is not something
routinely associated with the
Wolverines. It is associated with
Barnes Arico.
Fresh off of a Sweet Sixteen
appearance with St. John's last
season, and three consecutive
NCAA Tournament appearances,
Barnes Arico came to Michigan
with an idea in mind - building a
championship program.
Without a doubt, Barnes Arico
has done just that, leading the
Wolverines to their best start in
program history while tyingthe
program's mark for consecutive
games won.
With her 15-2 start, Barnes
Arico is already tied for the
second-most wins by a first-year
head coach in Michigan history
and in the process, became the
first Michigan coach to win her
first two conference games, let
alone her first four.
Under her up-tempo coach-
ing style, the Wolverines were
thriving. They were finding the
open person on the offensive end
and shooting the nation's 10th-
best percentage from the field.
Despite their lack of height and
depth, they were still managing
to outrebound opponents by six
rebounds a game.
Barnes Arico was finding ways
for her team to succeed.
Somethingborrowed
Despite its hot start, Michi-
gan still wasn't drawing a large
crowd appropriate for ateam
with 15-2 record, but with a
matchup of Top-25 teams, the
Wolverines finally gottheir wish
on Monday night.
"You're always going to have
those loyal fans, but if you start
winning, you'll get more and
morepeople," Barnes Arico said.
"It always makes a big difference
to have that crowd."
Even with the black curtains
in the upper sections in use
to limit the seating capacity, a
three-fourths full Maize Rage

was loud and proud to cheer on
its home team in a game widely
promoted by the Athletic Depart-
ment.
With an autograph session
with star football players at five
o'clock, free pizza for all students
in attendance and the event being
designated as a five-point activity
on the H.A.LL application, the
2,842 people on hand made up-
the biggest home attendance of
the season.
And as the game progressed
with ups and downs, the crowd
got loud. When Thompson made
a 3-pointer in the opening min-
utes, the crowd went wild. When
a call didn't go their way, the fans
let the referees know their opin-
ion. For the first time this season,
a team other than the men's bas-
ketball team had a lively Crisler
Center crowd on its feet.
Something blue
It seemed that the Wolverines
had it all locked down. The fami-
lies were present. The rings were
ready to be exchanged.
It seemed that if Michigan had
anything for certain, it would
be something blue.,But just as
quickly as love can come, it can
easily slip away too.
And on Monday night, the.
team inblue postponed Michi-
gan's wedding. With fans in
white supporting Penn State and
upstagingthe bride-to-be, Michi-
gan shot a season-low 28 percent
from the field. Meanwhile, the
Lady Lions' two preseason Big
Ten first-team players, Alex Bent-
ley and Maggie Lucas, combined
for 35 points while toying with
the Wolverines' hearts from start
to finish in their 59-49 victory.
But not all is lost for Michigan;
a team that was just a few made
jumpers from going on its honey-
moon. The season is still young
and as in any break-up, you have
to move on to bigger and better
things.
For the Wolverines, the bigger
and better things start with Indi-
ana on Thursday.



ROAD WIN
From Page 1B
through the rest of the stanza
- they effortlessly killed off
its first penalty a couple of
minutes later.
But as the period started
to wind down, the -Lakers
regained their confidence, and
started peppering junior goal-
tender Adam Janecyk with
shots. It seemed to be a matter
of time before Lake Superior
State (8-9-1, 13-12-1) found
the back of the net - and they
did, with an effortless back-
hand from the slot with a little
more than one minute left in
the frame.
When the whistle blew at
the end of the first period, a
skirmish broke out between
junior defenseman Jon Mer-
rill and a Laker, resulting in a
Michigan pen'alty kill to kick
off the second frame.
Once again, the penalty-
kill unit killed off the penalty
without batting an eye, and
Michigan dominated posses-
sion in the second period with
countless grade-A scoring
opportunities, though they
just couldn't bury the chances.
That is, until senior for-
ward A.J. Treais' one timer
off a beautiful feed from soph-
omore forward Alex Guptill's
turnover in the neutral zone
found twine to simultaneous-
ly put the Wolverines up 2-1
and end the captain's scoring
drought that had lasted since
Dec.1.
But once again, Michi-
gan's lead was short lived as
the Lakers knotted up the
game minutes later on the

man advantage to finally end
the Wolverines' perfect pen-
alty kill, which-had thwarted
three Lake Superior State
penalties up to that point.
Where Michigan's defense
had appeared strong before, it
started to collapse upon itself
in the final period. Though
Janecyk was on the receiving
end of some puck luck, that
didn't excuse the miscues
that brought the puck dan-
gerously close to crossing the
line, including a turnover in
the neutral zone that lead to
a Lake Superior State break-
away.
But Janecyk's luck couldn't
last forever, and the Lakers
slammed in a rebound goal to
put them up 3-2, a score that
would stand, with 13 minutes
remaining in the game. After
that, the Wolverine offense
started to pick itself up, but
was unable to create the same
quality looks at net that they
had earlier on in the game.
"We just needed one shot
to get by them and that never
happened," Bereason said.
"We got some good shots and
some good looks and the puck
never went in. We got (some)
good chances (but) it's tough
to buy a goal. Tonight, we
were lucky to get two."
And the Wolverines, who
had been on cloud nine the
night before, could barely
find the words to explain how
the game slipped out of their
grasp.
"I thought we deserved to
win this game," Treais said.
"(We) just didn't bury our
chances and they got lucky
on a few rebounds. That's the
way it goes sometimes."

BURKE

been around the show since
they have been playing college
basketball. This allows the pro-
ducers of the show to track cer-
tain players, like Burke, before
they even begin college.
This is the third time Burke has
been featured on "The Journey,"
but it's the first time this season.
Generally, each individual seg-
ment runs about six minutes, so
it's a telling sign of Burke's young
career that he has already been
featured three times in less than
two full seasons.
In this week's episode, foot-
age from Burke's senior season
of high school was shown as part
of the show. Even though Burke
wasn't highly recruited before
he became a Wolverine, the pro-
ducers of "The Journey" filmed
Burke in high school and held

onto that footage for three years.
In the scene, Burke is dribbling
the ball in his Northland High
School jersey at the top of the
key. The camera unfocuses for a
couple seconds, revealing Beilein
sitting behind him, intently
watching his future floor general.
"We had kind of known about
Trey a year earlier, because we
had gone to do a story about Jared
Sullinger, whose dad just hap-
pened to be Burke's coach," said
Bill Friedman, a senior producer
at the Big Ten Network. "We
shot the game and saw this kid
was really good. At the time, he
had been a Michigan commit, so
we kind of sat on that footage. It
worked out."
The show wouldn't function
without the amount of access it
is granted. "The Journey" shoots
around 15-25 hours a week, even
thoughthe showisjust ahalfhour
- closer to 22 minutes with com-
mercials.

Friedman and the other pro-
ducers of the show have wit-
nessed Michigan's ascension over
the last three seasons, from Big
Ten also-ran to national contend-
er, and he had good things to say
about the progress of the Michi-
gan program over the last three
seasons.
"It's been really neat for us to
see how the program has grown,"
Friedman said. "Beilein is very
embracing of what we try to do,
his assistants are great people,
and the players are well-spoken,
engaging people. That's what's
fun to be around. You don't have
to worry about his team, because
they all have their heads on
straight.
"That's one of the things that
comes across to us loud and clear
when we visit Michigan. They are
really fun to be around."

PAUL SHtERMAN/Daily
Freshman defender Jacob Trouba continued to fuel Michigan's power play against Lake Superior State.
Yeah we're talking
bo u t play'.offs

SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. -
The calendar said January,
but the looks on the play-
ers'
faces said
March.
During
a chippy
first period,
freshman
defenseman
Jacob Trouba MATT
smirked at a
particularly SLOVIN
frisky oppos-
ingforward
condescendingly - as if to say,
"You're not worth it." One road
win, the team's first of the season,
wasn't enough. Junior forward
Luke Moffatt's face after Friday's
game said they wanted more,
though they ended up falling
short.
Welcome to the new reality for
the Michigan hockeyteam - a
10-game playoff gauntlet, where
every night's a grind, a must-win
and a punch'in the gut.
And thegrand prize?
A chance to make some noise
in the actual CCHA playoffs.
With their new win-or-die
mentality, the Wolverines weath-
ered the weekend by splitting
with Lake Superior State and
avoiding, at least temporarily, the
league's cellar that as recently as
last weekend seemed to be Michi-
gan's destiny.

"We decided we're going to
start playing some playoff hock-
ey," Moffatt said after Friday's
win. "We really decided to bear
down, not worry about the stand-
ings ... just worry about winning
some games, like we would in the
playoffs."
This wasn't a playoff series but
the team seemed to treat it like
one. It certainly felt like one at
times. And with the exception of
the final 20 minutes or so of the
Saturday night defeat when the
offense went into a shell, Michi-
gan was the better team.
But in the CCHA's swan song,
the league seems more volatile
than ever (Exhibit A: Bowling
Green, which has emerged from
the conference's basement to
win three of its last four games,
beating Michigan, Notre Dame
and Western Michigan). If the
regular season is any indication,
the playoffs willibe a crapshoot,
and this team will need all the
help it can get to make any sort of
run for Joe Louis Arena and the
CCHA final four.
And now, allithat's left for Mich-
igan to do is jockey for positioning.
Accordingto www.PlayoffSta-
tus.com, the Wolverines are the
second-likeliest teamto finish
in last place. If the remainder of
the season were played out 1000
times, the site predicts Michigan
would finish in last 34 percent of
the time, ahead of only Michigan

State (49 percent).
As it stands currently, the
Wolverines would open up the
playoffs at seventh-place Ohio
State - a seemingly winnable
series, though the teams have
yet to meet this season. But if the-
intensity Michigan showed this
weekend is a sign of what isto
come in the postseason, the num-
ber of series that seem winnable
grows.
"That's what we're trying to.
do, is get our team into playoff
hockey," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "We only have 10
games left and we need to play
playoff hockey. The season's going
to be a short one if we don't."
Ten games left. They could
be meaningless - a slow crawl
toward the playoffs, where it'll
be put up or an end to the 22-year
NCAA Tournament streak.
Instead, it's time for this team
to adjust to a playoff style of
hockey. Each penalty will hurt
the team a little more, which is
why Trouba showed restraint
when the much-smaller forward
tested him. Each goal can spark a
second or a third.
The only way that Michigan
will be able to catch lightning in a
bottle the rest of the season is if it
plays playoff-caliber hockey.
It showed it can this weekend.

SAULT STE. MARIE - The
results don't indicate just how
different the Michigan hockey
team looked against Lake Supe-
rior State.
The final box score does
show the difference between
the slumping players of old and
the new refurbished versions,
though.
In both Friday's 6-4 victory
and Saturday's 3-2 defeat, the
Wolverines received offensive
help from a quartet of forwards
- senior A.J. Treais, juniors
Luke Moffatt and Derek DeBoie
and freshman Boo Nieves - who
all scored at least once.
Although they havetstruggled
to contribute lately, the group
finished with an increase in the
number of shots on goal, and
decreased the pressure on the
depleted defensive corps. As
proof of the improved produc-
tion, Michigan recorded 46 shots
against the Lakers on Friday -
its first time tallying more than
40 since a shootout win at Ferris
State on Dec. 1.
Two of the Wolverines' next
three opponents - Western
Michigan and Notre Dame -
rank in the NCAA's top-five
defensive teams in goals against
average. Both teams are hold-
ing opposing teams to two goals
or less this season, which will
mean that the quartet will need
to step up once more in order for
Michigan to continue improv-
ing this season.
Averaging 34.5 shots on goal
per game heading into the Lake
Superior State series, the Wol-
verines exceeded that number
in both games after finishing
with 37on Saturday.
One of Michigan's leading
shooters during the weekend
was DeBlois, who finished with
nine shots on goal - good for
second on the team. DeBlois
also found the back of the net
when he knocked in a rebound
off sophomore Travis Lynch's .
slapshot on Friday. It was his
first goal since a Nov. 9 win over
Michigan State.
Moffatt ultimately highlight-

for the Wolverines, exceeding
his total scoring output this year

Lakers. Despite scoring against

'M' vaults to No. 1 ranking

MEN'S SWIMMING
For the Wolverines, a half
second away from victory

By SIMON KAUFMAN
DailySports Writer
The last time the Michigan
women's gymnastics team put up
a score better than 197.350, senior
captain Katie Zuraleswas a junior
in high school.
On Saturday, Zurales helped
lead the second-ranked Wolver-
ines to a victory over Illinois,
197.350-195.100, at Crisler Cen-
ter, capturing the all-around title
along the way. The team score is
the highest the Wolverines have
posted since a 197.600 against
Georgia on March 7, 2008.
Zurales placed first on the
uneven bars and balance beam
with
scores ILLINOIS 195.100
of 9.925 MICHIGAN 197.350
and
9.875, respectively. She also per-
formed well on the vault, with a
score of 9.900, and tallied 9.875
points on the floor exercise,
bringing her all-around score to
39.575 - a new career high.
"Katiehas just been rock solid,"
said Michigan coach Bev Plocki.
"This is a kid that probably never
thought she'd ever compete the
all around again (because of inju-
ries), and so to see her come back
and not only do the all around, but
do it at this level is pretty fantas-
tic."
Also contributing to the Wol-
verines' success was junior cap-
tain Joanna Sampson. Sampson
- who won the all around in the
team's previous meet against
Nebraska - captured the vault
and the floor titles with scores of
9.925 and 9.950, respectively.

performance afterward, Samp-

98.625-97.550.

Michigan extended its lead
on the balance beam, amass-
ing 49.225 points while Illinois
struggled on the floor exercise,
managing just 48.300 points. The
Wolverines finished the after-
noon strong with their best rota-
tion on the floor exercise with
three Michigan gymnasts receiv-
ing scores of 9.900 or better.
"I'm ecstatic," Plocki said. "To
be able to continue to improve
. from the first (meet) to the sec-
ond, now the second to the third,
is exciting."
The team knows big results are
expected but doesn't seem to be
letting the pressure catch up to it.
"I think (the pressure of being
ranked No. 2) excites us even
more, because for all of us on
this team this is the first time
that we've experienced that, and
we're excited to be there and
we're excited to work each week
to maintain it," said Zurales. "We
put in so much hard work in the
preseason that this is the payoff
and this is the fun part."

Nation's No. 1
team falls short
of Southern
California
By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
Three more points.
Three points were all that
separated the No. 1 Michigan
men's swimming and diving
team from what would have
been its fifth consecutive SMU
Classic title.
Three points that instead
went to No. 5 Southern Califor-
nia after it beat the Wolverines
in the final heat of the 200-yard
freestyle relay. By half a second.
Three points and half a sec-
ond.
The final race was typical of
the competition all weekend
at the SMU Classic in Dallas,
where the Wolverines raced
some of the top-ranked teams
in the NCAA, including No. 7
Florida and No. 16 Louisville.
The meet brings together
some of the strongest swimmers
in the country in a uniquely
small setting. Six schools com-
pete, but each only travels with
eight swimmers and one diver.
"It's a lot of fun," said Michi-
gan assistant coach Josh White.
"It's definitely a different set
up, but it's pretty neat because
every single swim really has

meaning in the score."
The Wolverines led the pack
at the end of the first day with
166 points after senior Miguel
Ortiz took first place in the
100-yard backstroke and led off
the winning 400-yard medley
team.
But this meet was the defini-
tion of a team effort, and every
swimmer made a big difference
on the scoreboard.
Along with their two first-
place finishes, Michigan's eight
swimmers showed their versa-
tility on Friday, taking second
place in four championship
heats and first and second place
in five consolation heats.

kept up the Sc S

in day two,
winning the
200-yard medley relay and
earning second place in every
other event.
Over the course of the meet,
Michigan showed off its excep-
tional speed in many events,

performing better than antici-
pated in a number of heats.
Senior Sean Fletcher record-
ed the fastest time'of any swim-
mer in the 100-yard butterfly
with a time of 47.24.
"On the relays, when we
weren't even expected to get
like top three, we stepped it up
and won a few and got second,
and some we weren't even con-
sidered," Fletcher said.
The Wolverines also succeed-
ed in surprising themselves.
Last year at the SMU Clas-
sic, Michigan, came out on top,
scoring a total of 318 points.
This year, despite finishing sec-
ond, the team scored 327 points
overall, highlighting the major
improvements made in speed
and performance during this
season.
Though the Wolverines were
unable to pick up three more
points and failed to bring home
another title, they collectively
consider the SMU Classic a
major success.
"We still have things we can
do better, as you always do,"
said coach White. "But in terms
of the overall level of perfor-
mance, it was one of the best
meets we had that hasn't been
a conference championship or
NCAA."
Added Fletcher: "I think it
was definitely considered a vic-
tory with times and I think it's
really helped us with motiva-
tion and seeing what we have to
do well at the end of the year."
