While 
various 
praises 
and 

concerns were voiced by faculty at 
the fourth and final LSA Diversity, 
Equity, & Inclusion plan’s feedback 
forum last Friday evening, most of 
the night’s attention was on the lack 
of faculty in attendance.

The large MLB Auditorium was 

mostly empty with about 40 LSA 
faculty were present.

Liz Cole, associate dean for 

social sciences, led the forum as she 
had the previous three by guiding 
the audience through the main 
faculty goals of the plan, though 
she also addressed the issue of her 
colleagues’ absence, saying, “The 

In the first three Saturdays 

in September, Hawaii, Central 
Florida and Colorado each came 
into Michigan Stadium, each 
took a beating at the hands of 
the Michigan football team and 
each trudged off the field, quietly 
holding their helmets.

But then this Saturday arrived, 

and the Big Ten season began 
with Penn State. Non-conference 
tune-ups in the past, the Nittany 
Lions presumably brought a 
tougher test.

And yet they suffered the 

same fate, as the Wolverines 
steamrolled another outmatched 
visitor, 
scoring 
six 
rushing 

touchdowns 
and 
smothering 

Penn State’s offense in a 49-10 
victory.

They have dealt similar fates 

to 
other 
Michigan 
Stadium 

visitors in the past two seasons. 
It 
happened 
first 
a 
year 

ago with Oregon State, Jim 
Harbaugh’s team’s first victim 
by a score of 35-7. Later came 
a ranked Northwestern team, 
which Michigan exposed and 
dispatched, 38-0. Just last week, 
Colorado came to town off two 
lopsided victories and threatened 
to knock off the Wolverines, yet 
still fell by 17.

Much like it did against those 

opponents, Michigan controlled 
the line of scrimmage and, with 
it, the game. The Wolverines 

As Political Science Prof. Mika 

LaVaque-Manty addressed the 
students on the first day of his 
class, “The Games We Play,” he 
said something that surprised 
many in attendance — that he 
expected most of the 200-person 
lecture hall to get an A as a final 
grade.

“The way that this course is 

designed means that you will 
have to work hard to do poorly,” 
LaVaque-Manty said.

LaVaque-Manty 
expects 

most students to get an A in his 
classes because he structures it 
using a method calling ‘gameful 
learning’ —a process by which 
a professor sets a point goal 
for a class, and students can 
earn 
points 
by 
completing 

assignments and projects chosen 
by themselves.

Students in classes structured 

this way walk in with a zero, 
without any points. They must 
earn the points by completing 
assignments and projects, and 
LaVaque-Manty says for his class, 
there are more than enough to 
earn an A.

This 
is 
fundamentally 

different from grading in most 
classes at the University, in which 
each student begins at the highest 
possible grade — a 100 percent — 
and steadily loses points with 
each 
assignment 
missed 
or 

wrong answer on an exam.

LaVaque-Manty’s 
course 

is part of a larger initiative by 

the University to encourage 
gameful learning, aided by a 
learning platform built around 
the concept, GameCraft, that 
was developed at the School of 
Information five years ago.

“I think that it is very 

important in education today 
for students to develop their 
own 
autonomy 
and 
agency 

as 
learners,” 
LaVaque-Manty 

said,“When you are given the 
ability to choose the assignments 
that you want to complete, you 

develop 
better 
metacognitive 

skills, the skills of good learners.”

The 
start 
of 
gameful 

learning at UM

Instituting gameful learning 

in the classroom requires doing 
a number of things differently, 
and in many cases, that includes 
incorporating a new platform for 
students.

At UM, for most classes using 

gameful learning, that platform 
is GameCraft, developed by 
School of Information Prof. Barry 

Fishman and Rackham student 
Caitlin Holman.

Fishman and Holman created 

the tool based on the self-
determination 
theory, 
which 

emphasizes the importance of 
supporting 
students’ 
natural 

behavioral 
and 
academic 

tendencies through academic 
autonomy 
— 
students 
are 

encouraged to chart their own 
academic course based on their 
own interests, instead of a set, 

FLINT — Chelsea Clinton 

made a campaign stop in Flint 
Friday morning for her mother, 
Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton, at Greater Holy 
Temple Church in Flint.

Following 
remarks 
from 

Clinton, 
Flint 
Mayor 
Karen 

Weaver and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee 
(D—Flint) at the church, Clinton 
also visited the United Auto 
Workers station in Flint, which is 
currently used as a call center for 
the Clinton campaign.

In her speech Friday, Weaver 

said the Clinton campaign has 
helped Flint respond to the 
water crisis the city is currently 
facing, after a temporary switch 
to Detroit’s water caused lead to 
leach into Flint’s water.

“We have taken this crisis, and 

this challenge, and made it into 
an opportunity for the people 
here in the city of Flint,” Weaver 
said. “I remember shortly after 
the declaration we got a call from 
Hillary Clinton, and she said: 
‘I’m sending some people to see 
what’s going on.’ And we talked 
about the water crisis and we

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Culture Officer Latisha Cunningham speaks at the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion forum for staff members at Lorch Hall Friday

Two weeks before University 

of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel is slated to unveil his 
University-wide 
strategic 
plan 

for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, 
LSA staff members — a group that 
includes assistants, advisors and 

other 
non-professors 
working 

at the University— gathered to 
discuss their school-specific plan, 
voicing both praise and some 
hesitations about the long-term 
implementation of the plan.

Similar to LSA faculty and 

students, staff members listened 
to a presentation on LSA’s strategic 
plan — a first draft of which was

The University of Michigan’s 

Central 
Student 
Government 

released 
a 
statement 
on 
its 

Facebook page Friday in solidarity 
with Eastern Michigan University 
and several cities where allegations 
of racially charged police brutality 
have been raised, most recently in 
Charlotte, N.C.

The statement also affirmed 

the 
body’s 
support 
of 
the 

#BlackLivesMatter 
movement, 

which has been active on the 
University of Michigan’s campus 
as recently as Saturday.

“All of us, regardless of how 

directly or indirectly these issues 
impact us, must stand up and 
fight against all forms of injustice 
and bigotry,” the statement reads. 
“Be an ally through your actions. 
Challenge and call in those around 
you to be and do better.”

Last Tuesday, EMU found 

that racially charged slurs were 
graffitied on several academic 
and student housing buildings.
Though the university washed 
away the graffiti, The Eastern 
Echo reported that EMU students 
gathered outside the building

talked about the need for Flint to 
be part of the solution to what’s 
going on here.”

During the course of the 

primary and the general election, 
Flint 
and 
the 
water 
crisis 

have been prominent points 
of discussion, especially for 
Democrats. This is the third time 
Chelsea Clinton has visited in 
the city for her mother, following 
a February stop when she toured 
the Flint Water treatment plant 
and spoke with union workers. 
Hillary 
Clinton 
visited 
city 

shortly afterward, speaking at 
a church in February alongside 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver.

Chelsea Clinton also visited 

Flint in March to announce the 
creation of the Flint WaterWorks 
project, which gave jobs to 
over 100 young Flint residents 
between the ages of 16-24 to 
both provide services to the city 
amidst the crisis and encourage 
these “opportunity youth” to 
strive to finish their education 
or 
move 
towards 
creating 

professional goals.

Weaver 
pointed 
to 
the 

program 
as 
one 
way 
the 

campaign had aided Flint.

“While 
we 
were 
really 

thankful to have the national 
guard distributing water, we 
knew we had people in the 
community that needed to be 
part of the healing process and 

the rebuilding process,” Weaver 
said. “So I talked to her and 
her team about wanting to put 
young people to work.”

Chelsea Clinton, who was 

pregnant when she announced 
the Flint WaterWorks program, 
said her viewpoint as a mother 
was one of the reasons she feels 
so impassioned for aiding the 
city.

“When I was in Flint in 

February and March, I was quite 
pregnant, and now I have a two 
year old and a three month old,” 
Clinton said. “I could not imagine 
the horrifying pain of expectant 
and new moms worried about the 
health of their children because 
the government failed to keep 
their water safe. That should not 
be something any mother in the 
United States of America in the 
21st century should ever have to 
worry about.”

Clinton told reporters after 

the event that she hopes to see 
Flint continue to be discussed 
during the campaign, especially 
as the first presidential debate 
grows closer. She noted that 
though 
she 
has 
not 
been 

involved in her mother’s debate 
preparations, she hopes to hear 
dialogue regarding the issues of 
the city.

To the crowd Friday, she said 

the water crisis and issues like it 
highlight the importance of this 
election.

“This is the most important 

election of my lifetime,” Clinton 
said. “And we recognize that 
Flint is about all of us… Flint’s 

children are our children.”

She added that even if her 

mother is not elected president, 
she still intends to work towards 
healing Flint, but believes Hillary 
Clinton is the best candidate to 
address the issues of the city.

During his remarks, Kildee 

echoed Clinton’s comments, and 
said GOP presidential nominee 
Donald Trump doesn’t have the 
right approach for the city.

“There’s a whole range of 

policies that we need to pursue 
that would support communities 
like Flint and people who live 
in them,” Kildee said. “It’s no 
surprise that’s one of the reasons 
I’m such a serious and devoutful 
supporter of Secretary Clinton’s 
campaign, because looking at 
the America she offers versus a 
sort of casino-based approach to 
economics that Donald Trump 
offers, 
there’s 
no 
question 

where the American people and 
particularly the people of Flint 
will find an ally.”

Trump has also had a presence 

in the city as well, visiting last 
week, when he stopped at a 
Black church and toured a water 
treatment plant. His visit was 
met noticeably differently than 
Clinton’s — though the candidate 
requested to visit the Flint water 
treatment plant, Weaver did not 
grant his request.

During her remarks Friday 

the mayor said she did not 
receive 
any 
communications 

from Trump prior to or following 
the visit.

Flint resident Mildred Artis, a 

retired guidance counselor 
who volunteers at the call 
center, said she agreed with 
Kildee that Hillary Clinton 
is the best candidate to 
address the city’s issues.

“I think this has been just 

an outpouring of love from 
the Clintons as they always 
do,” Artis said. “That’s what 
I expect from them, and they 
did.”

Scott 
Hagerstrom, 

Michigan 
State 
Director 

for 
Trump’s 
campaign, 

responded to the visit in a 
statement Friday.

“After Hillary let slip at 

a Wall Street fundraiser 
earlier this month that she 
sees half of this country’s 
voters 
— 
including 

veterans, 
police 
officers, 

firefighters 
and 
other 

hard working Americans 
— 
as 
either 
‘deplorable’ 

or 
‘irredeemable,’ 

Michiganders 
have 
one 

question for Chelsea Clinton 
on her visit here – does she 
agree with Hillary’s view of 
them?”

Demonstrators march through Ann Arbor

Protesters gathered to advocate 

against police brutality in the 
U.S. and Ann Arbor in downtown 
Ann Arbor Saturday afternoon, 
marching 
through 
parts 
of 

downtown.

The rally, led by Black Lives 

Matter activists, started around 
noon at the Michigan Union, 
where protesters picketed for an 
hour and a half before walking 
through the streets.

According to the Facebook 

event, the protest was planned 
as a response to the shooting of 
Terence Crutcher, but also for the 
more than 708 people killed by 
police this year.

Crutcher, 40, was shot and 

killed by police on September 
16 in Tulsa, Oklahoma after 
approaching his SUV and raising 
his arms, according to NBC News 
and film footage of the event. He 
was unarmed.

Sierra Witcher, Black Lives 

Matter Detroit communications 
chair, said they heard about the 
event from Black activists in 
Ypsilanti and the Ann Arbor area 
while representing Black Lives 
Matter at an Eastern Michigan 
University protest in response to 
racial slurs spray-painted on one 
of their university buildings.

Witcher said several black 

activists 
were 
hesitant 
to 

participate in the Ann Arbor 
protest because the event was 
initially led by white activists.

“There was a lot of pressure to 

cancel the event,” Witcher said. 
“I suggested, this is going to be a 
very visible day, in a very visible 
space, in an overwhelmingly 
and oppressively white space. 
Therefore, if we can talk to the 
organizer and get him to agree to 
step to the side, so that black folks 
can lead and speak for themselves, 
as any true ally would, then we 
should make the most of this 
time.”

Ultimately, Witcher said, Ann 

Arbor resident Ethan Ketner, the 
original organizer, agreed to let 
Black Lives Matter take the lead.

“I believe in equality when 

it comes to life,” Ketner said. “I 
believe everybody deserves fair, 
equal rights, in every situation of 
life.”

Ketner 
said 
last 
year, 

particularly after the Michael 
Brown shooting — involving 
Brown, 
an 
unarmed 
Black 

teenager and Darren Wilson, a 
white police officer — there were 
a lot of activists setting up protests 
and marches in Ann Arbor, but 
this year he hasn’t noticed any 
activity. This is the third protest 
that he has put together since the 
summer.

Witcher 
said 
the 
overall 

purpose of the march was to 
protest state-sanctioned violence 
in the U.S. They defined state-
sanctioned violence as people 
being cut off from healthcare 
and from exercising their bodily 
autonomy through reproductive 
rights, among other things.

“This march is intended to 

bring visibility to the black folks 
who have been slain due to state-

sanctioned violence, which isn’t 
just limited to police brutality,” 
Witcher said.

James 
Benjey, 
a 
protester 

and Ann Arbor resident, said 
having the protest on a game 
day in Ann Arbor helped it get 
attention because of “the amount 
of people walking by, the amount 
of exposure that we have, the 
amount of people that are from 
out of town, coming into town.”

“They’re all curious as to what’s 

going on, because normally this 
would be a Michigan event, but 
this is a community event as well,” 
he added.

During the protest, marchers 

held up signs. One read, “We 
have nothing to lose but our 
chains. There comes a time when 
silence is betrayal. Speak up! My 
humanity should not be up for 
debate. #BlackLivesMatter.”

Another read, “We stand in 

solidarity because Black Lives 
Matter.”

Rick Catherman, a teacher from 

the Chelsea School District, spoke 
at the march, saying equality in 
schools is a key component in 
the protest of discrimination and 
violence against minorities. 

“We cannot forget in our state 

how much the lives of children 
matter in our school districts that 
are primarily African American 
and Latino,” he said. “Those 
schools in our state in particular, 
with our government trying to 
shut down schools, putting people 
into schools who don’t know 
anything about educating children 
— those folks can’t be forgotten in 
this discussion either.”

Black Lives Matter protestors rally
downtown to oppose police brutality


demanding that more of a response 
from university officials. Some 
students requested to have a day 
off in order to organize a response 
to the graffiti, while others called 
on their university to provide more 
mental health resources.

Hate speech was found again 

two days later on staircases of Wise 
Hall at EMU, a student dormitory 
centrally located near a dining hall.

The crime prompted student 

protests 
for 
more 
action 
by 

EMU, with students saying the 
administration 
had 
not 
done 

enough about the graffiti beyond 
removing it. About 200 students of 
color gathered at EMU’s football 
game this weekend to bring more 
awareness to the situations.

The University of Michigan faced 

a similar situation regarding anti-
Islam chalk drawings on the Diag 
last year, with multiple University 
students expressing frustration 

with the administration’s choice to 
not remove the chalk drawings. 

The 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University Student Government 
condemned 
the 
graffiti 
on 

their Facebook page Tuesday. 
Emily 
Kindred, 
the 
EMU 

student government director of 
communications, wrote in an email 
to the Daily that the organization 
plans to continue working with the 
University to address this issue.

“EMU Student Government is 

committed to working alongside 
our university, as well as our allies 
at the University of Michigan and 
beyond, to combat racism and 
injustice on our campus, within 
our community, and across the 
country,” she wrote. “We stand in 
complete solidarity with students 
of 
color 
and 
are 
committed 

to creating and fostering an 
environment where everyone is 
accepted and loved for who they 
are.”

CSG’s statement ended with 

#BlackLivesMatter, a hashtag for 
the movement surrounding police 
brutality in the United States 

toward Black life. The movement 
started in 2012 after 17-year-old 
Trayvon Martin was killed by 
George Zimmerman in Florida.

The 
University 
chapter 
of 

the National Association of the 
Advancement of Colored People 
and fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha 
also held a speakout on the Diag at 
the University last Thursday night, 
discussing the incident at EMU 
and police brutality in the United 
States. About 150 students were in 
attendance.

Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity 

member Christopher McClendon, 
a Business senior, spoke at the 
event.

“In this past week, we have 

witnessed on our campus, within 
this 
community, 
and 
in

finished with six sacks and 13 
tackles for loss, bringing their 
totals to 16 and 34, respectively, in 
those categories in the past three 
matchups against the Nittany 
Lions.

The 
biggest 
mismatch 

between the teams came when 
the 
Wolverines 
flexed 
their 

muscles on third down. Michigan 
entered with the top third-down 
conversion defense in the country 
at 10.5 percent, and Penn State 
was among the worst in the 
offensive category at 118th.

Early on, the teams played to 

those rankings. The Wolverines 
sacked the Nittany Lions on four 
of the first seven third downs, 
tackling running back Saquon 
Barkley for a loss on another stop 
and halting Penn State on a fourth 
down as well.

“I thought for the most part our 

guys were there and swarming,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“They 
were 

coming two, three, four at a time. 
I thought it was impressive.”

That was all the opportunity 

the offense needed. Penn State 
had to punt in the first two 
minutes of the game. On that 
play, redshirt sophomore Jabrill 
Peppers caught a booming 61-yard 
kick and returned it 51 yards to the 
opposing 9-yard line. Even with a 
15-yard sideline interference call, 
the Wolverines scored in seven 
plays, and they rolled from there.

“I think any time you shut down 

a team that early in the game, it 
kind of sets the tone for the rest of 
the game,” said senior linebacker 
Ben Gedeon. “I think we did a 
good job in the third quarter 
coming out of halftime as well.”

The offense made up for a lack 

of big plays with a series of long, 
methodical scoring drives. Its 
touchdowns in the first half came 
from one, two, three and two 
yards out. Freshman running back 
Chris Evans tacked on a three-
yarder in the third quarter, and 
sophomore running back Karan 
Higdon finally broke loose for a 
40-yard scamper in the fourth.

In all, the Wolverines picked 

up six rushing touchdowns from 
five different players: redshirt 
junior 
fullback 
Khalid 
Hill, 

senior running back De’Veon 
Smith, Higdon (twice), Evans and 
redshirt junior running back Ty 
Isaac. True freshman tight end 
Devin Asiasi found the end zone 
for the first time with a three-yard 
catch from redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight.

Meanwhile, 
aided 
by 
the 

returns 
of 
senior 
defensive 

end Taco Charlton and senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis from 
injury, the defense continued to 
shine.

Gedeon patrolled the field 

with 11 tackles. The Wolverines 
broke up three passes, hurried 
Penn State quarterback Trace 
McSorley four times and hit him 
several more. Redshirt junior 
linebacker Mike McCray added 
an easy interception in the open 
field for good measure.

Barkley was the lone bright 

spot for Penn State. He carried 
15 times for 59 yards and caught 
five passes for 77 more yards, at 
least tying for the team lead in 
all four categories. He had 136 of 
the Nittany Lions’ 172 total yards, 
with the six sacks hindering the 
latter count. Chris Godwin scored 
Penn State’s only touchdown on 
an eight-yard reception in the 
fourth quarter.

The Nittany Lions’ only other 

points came on a short field goal 
in the third quarter, a play that 
said all that needed to be said.

After 
the 
Wolverines 

dominated the first half and 
took a 28-0 lead, Penn State 
forced a punt and moved down 
inside Michigan’s five-yard line, 
attempting to shift the score 
toward respectable. A two-yard 
touchdown run would have cut 
the lead back to three touchdowns 
with still 26 minutes to play.

Instead, the Nittany Lions lined 

up for a short field goal. They then 
called timeout to discuss going for 
the touchdown, but ran out the 
field-goal team again for the kick. 
Franklin said after the game he 
wanted to be sure his team scored 
some points off of that possession.

Harbaugh, meanwhile, faced 

the same situation on the first 
series of the game, a 4th-and-
goal play from the one-yard line. 
Speight motioned to the sideline 
to go for it, and Harbaugh agreed. 
Hill punched it in on a fullback 
dive.

“He kind of gets a grin on his 

face, because I know his mindset 
is he wants to smash it in for a 
touchdown too,” Speight said. 
“It’s cool that we’re all on the 
same page.”

Last 
year’s 
game 
went 

similarly. 
Penn 
State 
came 

within striking distance four 
times but settled for three short 
field goals, stifled at the goal line 
by Michigan’s front seven. The 
Nittany Lions appeared to have 
improved in that area coming in, 
just as many of Michigan’s other 
recent opponents.

“When you got a D-line like we 

have,” Gedeon said, “it’s hard to 
even tell.”

rigid curriculum.

Under this system, students are 

expected to choose assignments 
based on their own interests, 
motivating them to learn course 
materials.

Fishman said the University 

allows professors great discretion 
when it comes to designing and 
grading courses, which is what 
spurred him and other professors, 
such 
as 
LaVaque-Manty, 
to 

explore new methods like gameful 
learning.

At the heart of the gameful 

learning program is a push to 
eliminate the negative stigma 
surrounding 
certain 
subjects 

by boosting student confidence, 
Fishman said. He noted when 
students feel confident in their 
competence, not only does grade-
based performance improve, but 

so do student attitudes toward 
learning.

“Students 
want 
to 
feel 

confident,” 
Fishman 
said. 

“Whatever level students start at, 
they should be able to try things 
that will be challenging, but things 
that they can accomplish.”

Fishman, 
LaVaque-Manty 

and other proponents of gameful 
learning 
argue 
the 
emphasis 

placed on grades in traditional 
learning 
environments 
makes 

attaining a high grade point 
average the end goal for too 
many people. Prioritizing grades, 
LaVaque-Manty 
said, 
prevents 

students from focusing on actually 
learning course material.

“In college, we view an 80 

percent as failing to know the 
final 20 percent of class material,” 
LaVaque-Manty said. “Gameful 
learning is different. If you get 80 
percent of the points, that’s not 
viewed as failing in a fifth of the 
material, it is looked at as having 
mastery over a lot of the new 

information.”

Fishman 
acknowledged 
that 

there has been some faculty 
resistance to the switch over 
concerns about gameful learning 
causing a lack of rigor, in which 
students choose the path of least 
resistance to achieve an A.

However, he noted that social 

scientific research has shown that 
a gameful approach to learning can 
strengthen student confidence. In a 
study he co-authored with Holman 
and then-Ph.D. candidate Stephen 
Aguilar 
called 
“Game-Inspired 

Design: Empirical Evidence in 
Support of Gameful Learning 
Environments,” Fishman found 
students generally held positive 
views of the reformed grading 
system, and these views resulted in 
greater confidence and perception 
of fairness.

He also said traditional learning 

and grading also have game-like 
elements, but re- emphasized his 
belief that the motivation to reach a 
particular grade, rather than to get 

the maximum educational value 
out of a particular course, creates 
a culture that encourages students 
to only act in ways that boost their 
GPAs.

“School is already a game,” 

Fishman said. “It just is a terrible 
game. However, there are things 
that University faculty can learn 
from 
well-designed 
games 
to 

make school into the kind of game 
where students behave like users 
of good games. They tend to seek 
out challenges — they take on 
these challenges not in spite of its 
difficulty, but rather because it is 
hard.”

For students, failing safely
For

GradeCraft’s

released last week — but while 
only 40 faculty members attended 
the faculty forum, about 120 staff 
members were present at their 
Friday forum.

The LSA strategic plan is one 

part of the overall DEI initiative, 
with 
forty-nine 
units 
across 

campus 
spent 
the 
summer 

developing their own strategies, 
which administrators are now 
rolling into one school-wide plan. 
Schlissel will debut the overall 
initiative on Oct. 6.

Latisha Cunningham, LSA’s first 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
officer, 
pointed 
to 
existing 

practices, such as staff recruitment 
and development, already in place 
in the college. In addition to 
reviewing best practices in every 
department and unit over the 
summer, Cunningham noted she 
administered an administrative 
forum survey across the college to 
gauge attitudes.

“LSA 
has 
deeply 
invested 

resources, time, energy and effort 

before this,” she told attendees. 
“We are just building on this … to 
the University’s overall strategic 
plan.”

Cunningham 
emphasized 

the inclusion in the plan of new 
cross-cultural and unconscious 
bias training for faculty and staff, 
referencing racial tension around 
the nation and even as close as 
Eastern 
Michigan 
University 

in Ypsilanti, where protesters 
gathered after racially charged 
graffiti was discovered last week. 
Cunningham 
also 
said 
LSA 

would 
invest 
more 
resources 

into cultivating an equitable and 
inclusive environment through 
these training sessions.

“One of the most common 

things I’ve heard from people 
applying to start in our position is 
that staff would like to be equipped 
with the tools to have those hard 
conversations with faculty, other 
staff and also students,” she said.

Staff 
members 
present 

welcomed the initiatives, but also 
shared hesitation about its lasting 
effectiveness.

Jeff 
Harrold, 
academic 

standards 
and 
special 

populations coordinator in the 
Newnan Advising Center, said 
administrators need to balance 
implementation and expectations 
of the plan.

“This was pleasantly received, 

and I know a lot of work went into 
it,” he said. “How it works out will 
depend now on disseminating 
information … if it’s done right, 
people will be able to engage 
across units.”

Amy Harris, director of the 

Museum 
of 
Natural 
History, 

urged the DEI team to think about 
implementing more personalized 
plans, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 

administration’s overall initiative, 
to ensure accountability.

“There’s been great input from 

everyone, but as a unit director, 
I’m especially interested in how 
we can develop plans within our 
units and even take responsibility 
on an individual basis,” she said. 
“(An individual plan) can be 
aligned with where each person is, 
whether it be certain tasks they set 
for themselves, or a larger goal.”

She added that overall, she 

thought ultimately the strategic 
plan — while admirable — needs to 

reach all levels of the college. 

“We need to bake this into our 

culture and not just have a plan 
that’s coming out of our central 
administration,” she said. 

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

affirmed 
the 
importance 
of 

accountability, arriving in the 
last half of the session to listen to 
attendees’ comments and address 
concerns.

“We’ve got a lot of work to do, 

and accountability is baked into 
this process. If this doesn’t work, I 
will not be the dean after a certain 
period of time,” he said. “Our 
expectations are high, and this is 
an exercise we’ve gone through 
as a campus before. Leadership … 
is on board, not just regard to our 
rhetoric but also the commitments 
we’re making financially to do the 
right things.”

Martin, along with Katrina 

Wade-Golden, 
director 
of 

evaluation and assessment for 
the Office of the Vice Provost for 
Equity, Inclusion, and Academic 
Affairs, also previewed a staff 
census to be administered next 
spring to provide baseline data on 
broader campus climate.

size of the audience does raise 
concern.”

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

said he was disappointed with 
the faculty turnout, but assured 
those in attendance that he was 
committed to doing the work to 
ensure the implementation of DEI 
is successful. 

“To be frank, I wish we had a 

couple hundred more colleagues 
with us today,” Martin said. 

The three main goals of the 

plan Cole focused on included 
improving faculty climate and 
retention, 
establishing 
stronger 

mentorship 
programs 
among 

faculty and strengthening faculty 
recruitment.

Cole said the administration 

found female professors often 
felt 
excluded 
from 
significant 

faculty policy discussions and that 
faculty who were committed to 
implementing 
diversity 
wanted 

more recognition.

Faculty in the audience agreed 

with this discussion. Mathematics 
Prof. Roman Vershynin said a 

sense of belonging among minority 
faculty can be improved.

“There 
are 
people 
in 

departments who reject diversity, 
so it is important to bring awareness 
to this topic,” Vershynin said.

To 
improve 
mentoring 
in 

particular, the plan outlines new 
LAUNCH mentorship programs 
for all departments, which would 
provide faculty with a support 
system 
by 
incorporating 
the 

department chair, a mentor within 
the department, a mentor outside 
the department, and a convenor, 
or someone who is trained for 
the role to implement mentorship 
programming.

Cole noted that a focus of the 

overall DEI plan is also on the 
recruitment and establishment of 
a postdoctoral fellowship program. 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel is expected to explain 
the postdoctoral fellowship plan 
in more detail on Oct. 6, when the 
DEI initiative is officially launched. 
Cole only briefly outlined the plan 
to the audience stating that the goal 
is to hire 50 postdoctoral fellows to 
LSA over the next five years who 
have the skills, backgrounds and 
commitment to enhance diversity 

on campus.

Faculty in attendence questioned 

the postdoctoral fellowship plan 
and how it would be successfully 
implemented.

“The proposal to have postdocs 

is complicated because different 
disciplines have different ways they 
use postdoctoral fellows” said Prof. 
Jim Penner-Hahn.

Another point of controversy 

among the attendees centered on 
potentially creating a new position 
of associate dean for diversity, 
equity and inclusion and faculty 
development.

As it stands in the plan, this 

dean would be responsible for 
communicating between different 
departments 
on 
campus. 
In 

response 
to 
faculty 
concerns, 

Martin acknowledged finding a 
place for the position would be 
complicated.

“We want to make sure that this 

person has real responsibility and 
authority in this organization and 
how that works in the way we are 
already structured is complicated,” 
Martin said. “We don’t know what 
the answer is, but we will have to 
make a decision within the next 
four to five months.”

Along 
with 
discussing 
the 

steps DEI planners are taking 
to achieve the plan’s goals, Cole 
also emphasized the importance 
students 
influences, 
citing 

#BeingBlackatUM 
movement, 

or #BBUM, which began in 2013 
when Black students took to 
Twitter to describe experiences 
of estrangement and exclusion on 
campus.

“We think it is really important 

to 
also 
acknowledge 
in 
the 

planning process the fundamental 
motivation of the students who 
participated in the Being Black 
at the University of Michigan 
movement,” Cole said. 

Two of the four forums held to 

discuss the plan have also been 
geared 
toward 
graduate 
and 

undergraduate students, another 
way administrators and faculty 
hope to include student voices in 
the plan’s creation.

In closing the forum, Martin 

reiterated that the purpose of the 
DEI initiative is to create a better 
University of Michigan.

“The goal is for LSA to be the 

absolutely best place in the world 
to be a faculty member or student,” 
Martin said.

e’re 
all 
familiar 

with 
the 
perceived 

dichotomy 
between 

humanities majors and majors 
that are a little more “career-
oriented.” Humanities majors are 
either criticized or lauded for being 
heady, wandering souls unworried 
about what kind of internship 
they’re offered over the summer 
or how much they will earn five 
years after undergrad. They’re 
never criticized or lauded for being 
career-oriented or seeking prestige 
like their supposed counterparts 
in the engineering and business 
schools. But, especially depending 
on what kind of humanities major 
one chooses, classes may be just 
as difficult and the pressure just 
as crushing to make that certain 
connection, to get that certain job 
— and priorities become just as 
warped in the process.

As someone who, for their entire 

time in college, has been declared 
in some kind of humanities major 
(excluding my brief but enthusiastic 
anthropology stint), I’ve been asked 
by relatives and family friends — 
in a tone doubtful to the point of 
admonishment — the question: 
“What do you plan to do with that?”

So we have the classic scene 

of the angsty college kid at some 
family cookout, paper plate and 
slimy plastic fork in hand, rolling 
their eyes at adults who “just 
don’t understand” the value of 
my humanities major. Uncle John 
probably doesn’t even get art.

My answer to that question 

had, for a while, been that I would 
become a college professor or 
work at some imaginary literary 
magazine as a fallback. By the start 
of last winter, the second semester 
of my sophomore year, I had settled 
into a comparative literature major, 
which lots of people describe 
(somewhat inaccurately) as a “more 
intense version” of an English 
major. It requires students to work 
in at least one language other than 
their first language, and to write a 
thesis during their senior year using 
comparative analysis (potentially 
across languages and cultures) to 
draw broader conclusions about 
some more general topic. I had 

chosen English and French as my 
two languages, even though, to 
be frank, I wasn’t that amazing at 
learning foreign languages — nor 
did I enjoy the process.

On the outside, I think I seemed 

sophisticated, even headier than my 
friends who were English majors. I 
got to read more aesthetic, literary 
and cultural theory — Foucault, 
Derrida, Butler — and liked to think 
this surrounded me with a cloud of 
mystery. I felt elusive, serious and 
sparkling listing off the classes I’d 
taken, the books I’d read and the 
professors I knew. I rode with it 
for a while, convincing myself I’d 
write a thesis about humans and 
machines in the digital age. I’d tie 
gender in there somewhere and 
become the Michel Foucault of my 
generation.

This was a different kind of 

career-orientedness, a different 
kind of quest for prestige. For 
me it looked like doing all 
the 
supplementary 
readings, 

going 
to 
office 
hours 
and 

convincing myself I enjoyed the 
readings because the ideas they 
addressed were so cool — that 
post-structuralism kind of felt 
pertinent, albeit in that distant 
and spacey way theory often does. 
It looked like going to Berkeley for 
my Ph.D., securing tenure at some 
other Ivy or almost-Ivy before 
I really stopped looking 19. The 
muscles in my face and shoulders 
growing ever-tenser, increasing 
in density directly proportional 
to the readings I did, it wasn’t 
until that spring I realized how 
serious I’d gotten. 

Enter 
the 
New 
England 

Literature Program (NELP), a 
program through the English 
Department in which 40 students 
and 13 instructors meander into 
the woods of New Hampshire, 
spending six weeks immersed 
in literature, introspecting and 
writing, pseudo-transcendentalist 
style. It was with the sway of tall 
New England trees in the wind 
on Lake Winnipesaukee, with 
Thoreau, Emerson, the poems 
of Emily Dickinson and Wallace 
Stevens that I finally relaxed my 
trapezius muscles and rediscovered 

how to just be.

Needless to say, coming back 

to campus was weird. Now in my 
junior year, I was taking more 
French than ever, expected to read 
and write at a higher level than 
I ever had before. I found myself 
stumbling through texts written 
in French whose messages I knew 
mattered so much to me, if only I 
was smart enough to understand 
them. I wanted to be able to read 
and to write with just as much 
nuance as I could in English, my 
first language. When I step back 
and think about it, it’s no wonder 
the French was so difficult: Um, it’s 
a foreign language.

Feeling defeated and, combined 

with my job as Opinion editor here 
at the Daily, I was intellectually 
and emotionally overloaded with 
difficult topics to digest. I walked 
out of my French class one day 
and realized the playful self I had 
rediscovered at NELP felt so far 
away, waving at me to come find 
her again.

I tell this whole story to say the 

myth that humanities students 
are never career-oriented is just 
that: a myth. You can exhaust 
yourself in any path you choose 
in life — faking it, hoping that at 
some undeterminable point in 
the future you’ll finally make it. 
The stereotype of the humanities 
student allows people to assume 
we’re nurturing our souls above all 
else — forget the career; forget the 
salary; forget the reputation. This 
was probably what people assumed 
I was doing for most of college, even 
though my mentality might not 
have been all that different from a 
finance concentration at Ross.

OK, 
maybe 
that’s 
an 

exaggeration, but you get my point. 
It’s all about priorities — priorities, 
priorities, priorities. I set mine in 
line this past week, changing to an 
English major and spending some 
time taking care of a few plants I’d 
been neglecting around my house. 
I’m doing what I like, and so far it 
feels good. Now I’m riding with 
this plan for a while.

FROM THE DAILY

Housing must be more affordable

A

s the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor grow in population 
and develop each year, demand for off-campus housing increases. 
Developers encourage a higher concentration of wealth in the 

downtown Ann Arbor area by building luxury high-rise apartments, and 
even with increased housing availability provided by these high-rises, prices 
in other areas around campus remain astronomical. Ann Arbor’s municipal 
code allows rental companies and landlords the autonomy to overcharge 
residents for the quality of their properties because of a lack of regulation 
around pricing. The municipal code’s lack of specificity regarding when new 
tenants can sign leases also induces a race to secure off-campus housing 
each fall. Developers must build more affordable apartment complexes 
for the average in-state student and the average Ann Arbor resident. 
Additionally, the city of Ann Arbor needs to tighten rent regulations and 
increase enforcement of such regulations to combat these issues.

Though newly built high-

rises change the city landscape 
of Ann Arbor dramatically, time 
has shown demand for such 
housing matches supply, as these 
buildings continue to be filled 
each year. In an ideal world, 
luxury apartments concentrated 
in the center of the city, close to 
campus, would lower housing 
prices in areas closer to South 
Campus and Kerrytown. But 
according to a recent study 
prepared for the Washtenaw 
County Office of Community 
and 
Economic 
Development, 

this may not be the case. Instead 
of decreased prices for housing 
options a little further off 
campus, UM students are seeing 
rent prices that stay at the same 
high rates in surrounding areas.

Furthermore, 
wealthier 

students 
and 
city 
residents 

are the ones living in these 
luxury 
high-rise 
apartments, 

which could possibly result in 
an increased wealth disparity 
within Ann Arbor. And according 
to the Washtenaw County OCED, 
wealth 
disparities 
are 
also 

increasing between Ann Arbor 
and Ypsilanti. While Ann Arbor’s 
economy may continue to grow 
because of new development 
and businesses moving in, the 
study suggests Ypsilanti’s will 
only worsen over time. These 
disparities 
are 
especially 

damaging to students at the 
University, 
as 
they 
attempt 

to balance living in a location 
suitable for getting to classes 
and maintaining affordability 
with rising tuition prices.

All 
options 
need 
to 
be 

explored to fix Ann Arbor’s 
housing affordability issue. In 
particular, City Council should 

look at options for altering the 
city’s housing code pertaining 
to how and where development 
companies build luxury high-
rise apartments. City Council 
also needs to address ways 
in which it can change the 
housing code to improve the 
leasing process.

High housing demand south 

of campus and near Kerrytown 
causes residents and students 
to pay relatively high rent 
for 
what 
they’re 
getting. 

Landlords can charge upward 
of $850 per month per tenant 
for what may be mediocre to 
subpar properties.

Beyond paying high prices, 

the logistical timeline to find 
a lease has become a rat race. 
The city’s leasing laws allow 
rental companies and landlords 
to 
lease 
their 
properties 

according to a schedule that 
creates a housing frenzy for 
students at the start of each 
fall semester. According to the 
city’s housing code, leasers may 
not start showing properties to 
prospective renters until 70 days 
after the current tenant’s lease 
has begun. Because of growing 
pressure 
to 
find 
housing, 

however, prospective tenants 
are incentivized to find homes 
on their own and secure under-
the-table promise for the next 
year’s lease before the 70 days 
have passed.

These 
transactions 
can, 

and often do, occur under the 
table, but leasers themselves 
sometimes ignore municipal 
code and officially sign leases 
to new tenants before the 
70 days have passed. In an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily in Oct. 2015, Ann Arbor 

property manager Jon Keller 
said rental companies and 
landlords do this because the 
penalty fee is negligible — and 
sometimes not enforced.

Whether it’s done under the 

table or illegally, Ann Arbor’s 
current municipal code leaves 
students scrambling for next 
year’s housing each fall, during 
a time when they’re trying to 
settle into campus life and into 
their current houses. Many 
students also don’t know who 
they’ll want to live with a year 
down the line, when their lease 
will actually begin. Ann Arbor’s 
municipal code should place 
tighter controls on the leasing 
process, and these controls 
should be better enforced for the 
sake of students and Ann Arbor 
residents alike.

Luxury high-rise apartment 

complexes keep popping up 
and will continue to unless 
tighter regulations stop them. 
While there is demand for such 
housing, the increased supply 
and concentration of luxury 
living spaces in the center of 
the city is only contributing 
to increased wealth disparity 
within Ann Arbor and between 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 
Ypsilanti. 

What’s more, the city’s current 
municipal code too often leaves 
residents and students in off-
campus housing with no other 
option but to sign leases before 
they’re ready and to pay more 
for rent than properties are 
worth. City Council needs 
to move to alter the housing 
code and tighten enforcement 
to combat these issues, which 
would 
benefit 
residents 
of 

Ypsilanti, 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 

students at the University.

The left’s hypocrisy on political discourse

MAX RYSZTAK | COLUMN

R

ecently, Hillary Clinton 
referred to some of Donald 
Trump’s 
supporters 

as “deplorables” in a rare and 
surprising gaffe for a political 
veteran like Clinton. This section 
from her fundraising speech is 
just one example of many where 
left-leaning 
political 

candidates 
diminish 

people themselves and 
not their ideas:

You know, to just be 

grossly generalistic, you 
could put half of Trump’s 
supporters into what I call 
the ‘basket of deplorables.’ 
Right? The racist, sexist, 
homophobic, xenophobic, 
Islamophobic 
— 

you 
name 
it. 
And 

unfortunately there are people like 
that. And he has lifted them up. He 
has given voice to their websites that 
used to only have 11,000 people — now 
11 million. He tweets and retweets 
their offensive hateful mean-spirited 
rhetoric. Now, some of those folks — 
they are irredeemable, but thankfully 
they are not America.

While Clinton went on to refer to 

the other half of Trump supporters 
as people who understandably 
felt betrayed and unheard by the 
government, there is an important 
point to be made about Clinton’s 
prepared remarks.

By referring to Trump supporters 

as 
“racist, 
sexist, 
homophobic, 

xenophobic, Islamophobic,” Clinton 
knowingly uses Trump’s policies 
to generalize a large proportion 
of American people in hopes of 
attaching labels to policy preferences. 
But if we actually look at Trump’s 
— and more broadly, Republican — 
policies, there is little justification 
for the labels Clinton uses in her 
recent statement.

Take, for example, the debate 

on immigration, one of Trump’s 
policy trademarks.

I’m a Republican and I disagree 

with Donald Trump on this issue 
— I think that he is wrong on the 
actual policy. I don’t think a wall is 
the entire solution to the problem, 
and I don’t think you can (or should) 
deport countless illegal aliens. But I 
don’t think his policy is racist in and 
of itself. Advocating for a wall, in 
hopes of cracking down on illegal 
immigration and drug flow so that 
those who attempt to come legally 

are not overshadowed by illegal 
migration is not racist, it’s simply 
a different proposal than most on 
this campus would favor. You may 
disagree with it, but you don’t have 
to call those who agree with Trump 
racists. They’re merely people who 
care about this country and have 

different ideas than 
you do.

There are certainly 

extremists within the 
Trump movement — 
and on all sides of the 
political 
spectrum 

— who deserve to be 
called what they are. 
But all Republicans are 
not inherently racist, 
sexist or Islamophobic. 
This 
practice 
of 

fighting against the person holding 
an idea, and not the idea itself, is 
the height of hypocrisy in modern 
political discourse.

Democrats 
often 
claim 
to 

be champions of diversity in 
all aspects of society, except 
for the diversity of opinion, 
where on campus they spread 
false enthusiasm for political 
discussions. Barely able to handle 
moderate speakers on campus and 
fueling hate toward those who 
disagree, many left-leaning college 
students and faculty represent the 
epitome of hypocrisy as they seek 
to suppress the diversity of ideas 
and discourse.

Many students have never 

been exposed to conservative 
policies on a larger level than 
what they watch on TV or read 
online. In my opinion, students 
fail to recognize that a large 
proportion of Americans have 
fundamental 
disagreements 

with the left-leaning preferences 
dominant on this campus — in 
effect delegitimizing what little 
intellectual 
diversity 
currently 

exists in Ann Arbor.

Since many of my peers don’t 

fully 
recognize 
that 
people 

hold a wide variety of opinions 
and the extent to which people 
disagree with them, they treat 
most conservative policy ideas as 
inherently radical and illegitimate. 
Since many liberal students seem 
to find any opinion that isn’t the 
same as their own not credible, 
they 
attempt 
to 
completely 

eliminate it from the discussion.

In fact, that’s the hardest 

thing about being conservative 
on 
this 
campus. 
The 
mere 

mention of disagreement brings 
on 
an 
onslaught 
of 
name-

calling that often highlights my 
“oppressiveness.” Apparently, my 
“heteronormativity” and my “white 
privilege” make any and all of my 
opinions invalid. I’m not told that my 
beliefs are wrong. I’m told I — as a 
person — am fundamentally corrupt.

For example, I’ve been told 

many times that my political 
views are wrong when it comes 
to helping minority groups escape 
poverty, simply because I’m white. 
I guess if my limited experiences 
prevent me from having an 
opinion, no leftist who has yet to 
move past their on-campus, part-
time job, can tell me how “large 
corporations are destroying our 
national economy.”

We can never have too much 

debate or too much discourse, 
and we can never limit people’s 
right to have an opinion based 
on experiences they have or 
have not been through. Political 
and policy discussions need to 
be focused on the issue, and not 
the people holding the belief. We 
don’t need to call people racists 
for wanting stronger protection 
and a wall on our southern 
border. We don’t need to silence 
discussion because individuals 
don’t have equal or shared 
backgrounds. Both sides of the 
political spectrum would serve 
themselves well if they fought 
ideas and not individuals and 
allow all debate.

Experiences should serve to 

build opinions, not restrict them. 
A range of backgrounds, different 
cultures and identities and unique 
beliefs form individuals with 
different ideas. Any experience, no 
matter how influential or trivial, 
can build an opinion — and all 
opinions should be heard.

True discourse on this campus 

would 
improve 
if 
we 
could 

recognize that there are always 
going to be people who will 
disagree with us no matter what 
they believe, and they should be 
able to voice their concerns so we 
can achieve greater diversity.

‘Fleabag’ and flashbacks

TV COLUMN

I

’ve never really lost any-
one close to me. Two of my 
grandparents died when I 

was really little, so I hardly remem-
ber them. My cat died my senior 
year of high school, but we had 
seen it coming for a while, so by the 
time it happened it felt anticlimac-
tic. The closest person I’ve lost is 
my piano teacher of six years, who 
passed away earlier this year. I was 
a little sad, but we had drifted apart 
in the three years since I’d worked 
with her, so it didn’t hit as hard as 
it could have.

But, to a certain extent, we all 

know what loss feels like. We feel it 
during break-ups, or when we stop 
being friends with someone. Some-
times we even feel this vague hole 
inside us that we’re not sure how to 
fill, and we can’t remember when it 
formed or what was there before.

In the raunchy British com-

edy “Fleabag,” which came to 
Amazon Prime on Sept. 16, Flea-
bag’s life is filled with loss of all 
kinds. Her mother, who died two 
years ago, has been replaced by 
an abhorrent stepmother who 
repeatedly squashes any chance of 
Fleabag bonding with her father. 
She doesn’t get along well with her 
sister, a woman whose affection 
she desperately craves even though 
they’re completely different. The 
little café she owned with her best 
friend Boo will go under unless she 
secures a loan. And oh yeah, about 
that best friend: she recently com-
mitted suicide, leaving Fleabag 
more alone than ever.

What’s special about “Fleabag” 

isn’t the plot itself. There are count-
less shows about strained familial 
relations and the grieving process; 
Amazon’s other new series, “One 
Mississippi,” is another good one. 
What’s special about “Fleabag,” 
even more than its razor sharp 
sense of humor and Phoebe Waller-
Bridge’s amazing central perfor-
mance, is the way it uses formal 
elements to convey the unique 
symptoms of loss.

Central to all of this is the way 

Fleabag breaks the fourth wall, 
addressing us with raised eyebrows 
and Jim Halpert-esque reaction 
shots even while she’s still being 
spoken to. Breaking the fourth 

wall isn’t uncommon in comedy, 
especially in this age of mocku-
mentaries, but there’s something 
especially powerful about the way 
this show uses it. It only gradually 
becomes clear that Fleabag is hop-
ing her imaginary audience will 
fill the void left by her distant fam-
ily and, most prominently, her best 
friend. We are a poor substitute for 
Boo; we can listen and conspirato-
rially share in her hilarious obser-
vations about the weird world she 
lives in, but crucially, we can never 
quite respond.

A listening ear can also be a judg-

mental one, though, and despite 
Fleabag’s relative shamelessness 
about sex and manners, there’s a 
deep sense of guilt that pervades 
her demeanor, exploding into the 
forefront in the season finale. It’s 
clear that Fleabag harbors signifi-
cant shame about how she treated 
Boo in the time leading up to her 
suicide, and when she needs us the 
most, our silence comes across as 
judgment instead of understand-
ing. The camera following Fleabag 
begins to feel intrusive and cruel, 
like we are the killer in a horror 
movie, an embodiment of her emo-
tional demons chasing her.

Possibly the most effective ele-

ment of “Fleabag,” though, is its 
flashbacks. In most series, like 
“Orange is the New Black” and 
“Lost,” flashbacks are of uniform 
length, structured to tell minia-
ture, contained stories from char-
acters’ pasts to give us insight about 
who they are. In “Fleabag,” how-
ever, flashbacks happen organical-
ly, whenever something reminds 
Fleabag of an old memory with 
Boo. It’s one of the most authentic 
depiction of flashbacks I’ve ever 
seen; they vary in length, some-
times lasting full scene-length, 
sometimes just a few seconds and 
in one particularly brutal instance, 
only a split-second. You can feel 
the flashbacks happening in real 
time — when there’s a particularly 
long scene from Fleabag’s past, she 
seems to zone out, only yanking 
herself back to consciousness when 
the memory is complete.

The flashbacks again exemplify 

that “Fleabag” understands loss 
better than any other show this 
year. There’s no closure to be found 
for Fleabag, only haunting, painful 
reminders of the friend she lost. 
Memories that used to be happy, 

comforting and pure have been 
tainted by the agony of the present; 
there’s nothing more heartbreak-
ing than watching Fleabag and Boo 
doubled over laughing. Reviews 
always use the phrase “you’ll laugh 
and you’ll cry” when referring to 
comedies with dramatic under-
tones, but the phrase is never so 
true as in “Fleabag,” when every 
hilarious moment in the past has 
an equal and opposite reaction. 
The most joyful moments are the 
most tragic.

Anybody can understand that, 

even if you haven’t lost someone in 
that way. When I think about happy 
moments from my childhood, they 
make me smile, but they also make 
me sad that I can’t go back. There’s 
something inherently devastating 
about considering the past; innocu-
ous moments you never thought 
twice about become rosy with the 
sheen of nostalgia, and you start 
missing everything just because 
you don’t have the option to go 
back. Sometimes I’ll have a split-
second flashback of myself just 
walking down the hallway in high 
school, and suddenly I’ll be ach-
ing from how much I miss it, even 
though it’s not a particularly note-
worthy moment.

Life is filled with flashbacks, 

even if they’re not as fully formed 
or structured as most TV flash-
backs are. There are tons of images 
I can think of that make me wish 
I could revisit an old memory: 
our high school parking lot as my 
friends and I pull out on the last day 
of school, fluorescent green-gray 
lights in a building across the street 
like something from a David Finch-
er movie, the taste of almonds as I 
double over laughing in a kitchen 
at 2:00 A.M., my own incredulous 
groan at something cheesy Carrie 
Bradshaw said. All these memories 
wash over me, provoked by random 
words.

I thought of that sensation when 

I watched “Fleabag”: the feeling 
of being assailed by unwelcome 
memories, memories that are so 
sad because of how happy they 
are. “Fleabag” illustrates that loss 
isn’t just about missing someone 
you love. It’s about missing every 
moment from the past, no matter 
how small.

Rosenstock is thinking about 

the taste of almonds. To give him a

BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily TV Columnist

Forget the classroom, lecture 

hall or library and abandon it for 
a 
non-traditional, 
co-learning 

workspace filled with educators, 
students, intellectuals and locals. 
Sound good? I know I’m in.

The 
Detroit 

City Study is a 
co-learning work-
space located at 
the University of 
Michigan Detroit 
Center, 
designed 

for people inter-
ested in engaging 
in academic dis-
courses in a non-
traditional 
way. 

At the Institute of 
the Humanities on 
Tuesday, the team 
behind this project will present 
feedback on their six-week sum-
mer pilot and reflect on their aca-
demic incubator composed of 12 
Ph.D. students across numerous 
departments.

In addition to the incubator, 

the team worked on collabora-
tive research projects in teams 
and evaluated how to make the 
research more available to all types 
of learners. Tuesday’s event will 
also serve as a way to envision the 
future of this project and encour-
age more people to take part in 
the movement towards collective 
learning outside of the classroom.

“At its most basic level, it is a 

co-working space, built around 
the work of education and learn-
ing,” said Rackham student Shira 
Schwartz, the project director. “It’s 
about creating more space for peo-
ple to come together as a commu-

nity through learning: to meet one 
another, share interests and work, 
gain support and collaborate.”

Many of the students involved 

in the launch are working on dis-
sertations and various projects in 
Detroit. Their initial goal was to 
cultivate new working spaces out-
side the borders of an academic 
institution.

“It was open to 

anyone,” Schwartz 
said. 
“You 
didn’t 

have to be a student 
at a specific school. 
You didn’t have to 
be a student at all. 
The idea is when 
you come into the 
space you become 
a student in some 
ways and encourage 
co-learning among 
different types of 
people.”

The project, she said, is moti-

vated by the deep need to rethink 
education in Detroit, as well as 
across the nation. The team behind 
the Detroit City Study believes that 
for education to be “re-thought,” it 
must be “re-placed.”

“ ‘Re-place’ means rethinking 

the place of education itself and 
the spatial dynamics of learning,” 
Schwartz said. “Where can learn-
ing happen? And how can chang-
ing up the space of learning impact 
the kind of knowledge and the 
relationships that are generated 
therein?” 

However, she noted that the 

team does not intend to restructure 
the educational system in the city. 
Instead, they want to offer a new 
type of learning space that projects 
similar goals to education within 
the school system. The graduate 
students believe that the devaluing 

of education is happening every-
where, and creating a co-learning 
space encouraging all types of 
learning is one step towards fixing 
the problem.

Schwartz outlined three lay-

ers that compose the concept of 
co-learning. First, it is a social spa-
tial structure, where people can 
come together and share in learn-
ing. Next, co-learning occurs on 
a mission level, meaning coming 
together to break down boundaries 
between the University and out-
side community.

The third layer of co-learning 

is a group study, which involves a 
specific topic that the group stud-
ies together to gain new knowledge 
in a way that differs from a typical 
school environment.

“Essentially, what we try to 

break away from is doing frontal 
presentations, but rather, empow-
ering people with the actual mate-
rials that are being discussed,” 
Schwartz said. “A lot of the work 
over the summer was working on 
transforming Ph.D. research into 
a form that could be digestible and 
something that people visiting the 
space could chew on themselves, 
rather than just being lectured at.”

The project specifically focuses 

on fields in the humanities and 
social sciences and addresses how 
to make graduate education more 
engaged and relevant towards 
these subjects.

“If these are pathways to under-

standing humanness and all of our 
most pressing concerns around 
our humanity, shouldn’t these 
disciplines have the most to say?” 
Schwartz asked.

The team behind the project 

believes these studies do have the 
most to say — they just need to be 
given a platform.

FILM REVIEW

TOUCHSTONE PICTURES

“Our faces are too big for this photo frame.”

“Titanic,” 
“The 
Notebook,” 

even “The Fault in Our Stars:” 
these films all end in a famil-
iar sob-induced migraine and 
salt-crusted cheeks. “The Light 
Between Oceans” 
is a newcomer to 
the genre of heart-
wrenching dramas 
of love and loss. 
But this film offers 
more artistry and 
more 
complexity 

than any of its pre-
decessors, making 
it a masterful piece 
of art and a must-
see for those seek-
ing emotional release.

“The Light Between Oceans” 

is the story of a lighthouse keeper 
and his wife, who rescue and keep 
a baby that washes up on their 
island shore, purposefully choos-
ing not to look into the baby’s 
original home. After five years of 
familial bliss, the couple is forced 
by guilt and circumstance to come 
to terms with reality and face the 
true, grieving mother of their 
child.

The film is a breathtaking piece 

of artwork. Comprised heavily of 
still landscape shots taken off the 
coast of Western Australia, each 
scene looks like an oil painting, 
with soft colors that melt togeth-
er in smooth compositions. The 
result is a collection of shots that 
create a gorgeous, pastoral land-
scape of the lighthouse island, one 
that is both serene and lonely. As a 

movie about a lighthouse keeper, 
light itself is a major element of 
the film’s cinematography. Direc-
tor Derek Cianfrance (“The Place 
Beyond the Pines”) masterfully 
manipulates natural light to add 
a delicate, dreamy effect to every 
scene. The light is both soft and 

pervasive, enhanc-
ing the physical 
and 
emotional 

aspects of the char-
acters in subtle but 
powerful ways.

Also an active 

agent in the film’s 
success, the score 
is a moving collec-
tion of sweeping 
piano pieces that 
intensify the emo-

tions of the characters. Composed 
by Alexandre Desplat, it’s no sur-
prise that the score is incredible — 
Desplat is a master composer, with 
a repertoire that includes “The 
Imitation Game,” “The King’s 
Speech” and “The Danish Girl,” 
among others. The entire artistic 
effect is one of intense beauty and 
intense solitude.

The acting is also spectacu-

lar, as one would expect with a 
trio of Academy Award winners 
and nominees. Playing the lead-
ing couple, Alicia Vikander (“The 
Danish Girl”) and Michael Fass-
bender (“Steve Jobs”) prove once 
again that they are masters of 
their class. Both deliver powerful 
performances through subtlety of 
emotion, moving mountains with 
a single change in expression. The 
pair act across a vast emotional 
spectrum, moving through new 

love to shattering loss to choking 
guilt. Their chemistry is palpable 
due to their bottomless talent and 
is perhaps enhanced by the fact 
that they’re dating in real life (God 
bless this world).

Rachel Weisz (“Youth”) also 

delivers a genuine and heartfelt 
performance of a mother grieving 
for her lost daughter. With skill, 
Weisz portrays an understandable 
desire to get her daughter back 
that shifts to a heartbreaking con-
fusion over what lies in her daugh-
ter’s best interest. Both Vikander 
and Weisz delve into the complex 
and layered emotions of mother-
hood, dealing with the devastating 
effects of miscarriage, grief and 
the salvation a child can bring or 
the destruction it can leave in its 
absence. The women work not as 
opposites or enemies, but as moth-
ers with vastly different, yet strik-
ingly similar perspectives.

The complexity in “The Light 

Between Oceans” lies in the 
absence of an antagonist. Each 
character must work through 
their own conflicting desires 
and senses of morality in a dif-
ficult and painful struggle for 
happiness and fulfillment. The 
film is about selfishness and 
the unintended consequences 
that come from following one’s 
desires, yet it also showcases the 
power of love that binds people 
together in unbreakable ways. 
This movie will make you heave 
with heart-wrenching sobs for a 
solid two hours in an agonizing 
but ultimately liberating experi-
ence, which is all one can really 
ask for.

FILM REVIEW

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

When bae impregnates you.

Initially, prospects for the third 

installment in the Bridget Jones 
franchise seemed slim. The open-
ing scene feels like 
déjà vu, recalling 
the whiny self-pity 
that characterized 
Bridget in the ear-
lier movies. Sepa-
rated 
from 
old 

beaus Mark Darcy 
and Daniel Cleav-
er for five years, 
Bridget 
Jones 

(Renée Zellweger, “Jerry Magu-
ire”), sits solo on her sofa, blaring 
“All By Myself” as she blows out a 
candle on her 43rd birthday.

But then she voices what we all 

want to say. “Fuck off!” she shouts, 
switching the channel to House of 
Pain’s “Jump Around” and wildly 
dancing and lip-syncing in her 
bedroom. And with that, the tone 
is set for a surprisingly funny romp 
through the uncharted territory 
that is unconventionally-led mid-
dle-aged life. Her bumbling antics 
tamed by the years, Bridget now 
works as a producer at a television 
news show with her best friend. 
Soon, she finds herself pregnant 
and wondering who the father 
is: the hip American dating web-
site mogul Jack Qwant (Patrick 

Dempsey, “Grey’s Anatomy”), or 
the very stoic, very English Mark 
Darcy (Colin Firth, “The King’s 
Speech”) — an increasingly impor-
tant question once she finds herself 
falling for both.

Bridget 
retains 
just 

enough 
irreverence 
to 

make her and her group of 
rabble-rousing friends feel 
refreshing. She battles the 
realities of growing older, 
learning to work with a 
new, younger boss and the 
“bearded hipsters” that 
helm her show’s rebrand-
ing and showing up at a 

music festival in kitten heels with 
a rolling suitcase in tow. The inter-
generational comedy feels slightly 
stiff, but still merits laughs, never 
reaching wine-mom-on-Facebook 
level out of touch.

The shining supporting cast is 

the heart of the movie. Her wise-
cracking 
gynecologist 
(Emma 

Thompson, “Saving Mr. Banks”) is 
the comedic star, helping Bridget 
balance the two-father dilemma 
she strings along. Firth’s expert 
reprisal of Darcy shines, his long-
standing work with the character 
resulting in a wealth of emotions 
simmering behind guarded eyes. 
Gemma Jones (“You Will Meet a 
Tall Dark Stranger”) and Jim Broad-
bent (“Iris”) return to play her par-
ents campaigning for public office in 

a more progressive era. A cameo by 
Ed Sheeran and a Pussy Riot-esque 
protest group add just enough silli-
ness to the mix.

Now, Bridget’s concerns actu-

ally feel validated. In previous 
films, Bridget’s character felt like 
a caricature of single woman-
hood — self-pity without improve-
ment and clumsiness pushed to 
the extreme for quirk factor alone. 
Rather 
than 
bemoaning 
being 

alone, she struggles to figure out 
which of her suitors is a better fit 
for her. Darcy’s aloofness once felt 
charming, but now that he’s older, 
Bridget expresses concern that he 
can’t offer the emotional support 
she needs. Instead of expecting a 
knight in shining armor to solve 
her problems, she looks inward to 
bettering herself and focuses on 
what’s best for her baby.

In a particularly heart-wrench-

ing scene, she sobs to the baby in 
her belly, “I’m sorry. I promised I 
would get this sorted out before 
you came, and I didn’t. But we 
can figure it out.” It’s a sight we’ve 
seen before: Bridget soaking wet 
in the rain, wallowing in her self-
created downfall after losing her 
phone, keys and bag. But despite 
endless weakly formed promises, 
this one feels genuine. Three films 
later, we finally want to root for 
her happily-ever-after, because for 
once, she’s the one creating it.

“Please tell me you’re seeing 

this, too.”

Rami Malek’s tongue-in-cheek 

reference 
during 
his 
Emmy 

Award 
accep-

tance speech for 
“Mr. Robot” was 
quite 
prescient, 

as 
it 
turned 

out. The finale, 
which 
techni-

cally aired in two 
parts over two 
weeks, revealed 
itself to be just 
like the rest of 
this season: intentionally vague, 
constantly interrogating its own 
internal reality and, unfortunate-
ly, more than a little inaccessible.

One would be hard-pressed 

to summarize just what, exactly, 
happened during season two of 
“Mr. Robot.” Sure, the show’s 
most prominent merits — atmo-
sphere, performances, character-
ization — often overshadow its 
plot, but it’s tough to stay rapt and 
invested during a show in which 
even the most crucial narrative 
threads are teased out in the most 
opaque ways.

Season two of “Mr. Robot” 

has provoked a muted response 
compared to the enthusiastic 
acclaim engendered by its first; 
comparisons have been drawn 
to Damon Lindelof’s (“The Left-
overs”) “Lost.” That show, too, 
was defined by its moody, surreal 
atmosphere and was heavily inter-
ested in asking more questions 
than it answered. “Mr. Robot,” 
however, has the additional bur-
den of its background as a show 
about hacking. This baggage 
makes the show more “realistic,” 
but it also means its creator, Sam 
Esmail (“Comet”), must explain 
himself a bit further. Hacker cul-
ture (a phrase I hope to never use 

again) is esoteric and uncharted 
narrative territory for most of pop 
culture, and packaging the more 
intriguing bits of exposition in a 
quick shot of, say, trash bags piling 
up on a New York street, doesn’t 
do as much of the heavy-lifting as 
it should.

Perhaps this criti-

cism is a bit harsh; 
there is, of course, fun 
in not knowing every 
little detail of a show. 
Being strung along by 
talented writers who 
know what they’re 
doing is one of TV’s 
greatest pleasures. But 
the issues with this 
finale — and, by exten-

sion, this season as a whole — are 
less about minute plot details and 
more about general narrative 
payoff. Season two confirmed 
“Mr. Robot” as a series concerned 
with character over plot: we see 
Darlene’s stunned reaction for 
an uncomfortable length before 
we’re shown just how much the 
FBI knows, and it’s Elliot’s face, 
lit up by a computer screen dis-
playing the plot details we so des-
perately crave, that the camera 
lingers on. But it comes off as a bit 
hypocritical when, after focusing 
so intensely on the paths these 
characters have taken this sea-
son, the finale’s closing 15 minutes 
raised an infinite number of ques-
tions about the plot: What has 
Tyrell been up to all season? What 
secret does Tyrell know about 
Elliot? What have Whiterose and 
Price been plotting? How does 
Angela tie into all of this? We have 
to care about the CTO guy again? 
Meanwhile, only one question 
pertains to our lead character: 
just how unreliable of a narrator 
is Elliot? These questions are fas-
cinating and potent, but they arise 
at the frustrating expense of any 
sort of satisfying conclusion to the 
past 12 episodes.

Yet, there’s still much to be 

intrigued by in “Mr. Robot” ’s idio-
syncratic finale. Esmail’s Hercu-
lean task of writing and directing 
every episode of the season pro-
duced some admittedly self-indul-
gent stretches as well as many 
undeniably brilliant flourishes 
of creativity. Specifically, Angela 
and Whiterose’s slow-burning, 
Lynchian conversation in the first 
part of the finale is delightfully 
strange and off-kilter, suggesting 
a tantalizing larger mythology for 
the series going forward. Grace 
Gummer’s (“The Newsroom”) 
Dom was the season’s most suc-
cessful new creation, and her 
interrogation of Darlene was the 
true highlight of the final episode. 
And Malek’s performance during 
his climactic confrontation with 
Mr. Robot and Tyrell is, as always, 
incredible.

As a whole, though, it’ll be hard 

to judge where season two of “Mr. 
Robot” stands when the show 
is over. From a purely aesthetic 
point of view, it’s hard to argue 
against the cohesion and confi-
dence of season two’s masterful 
marriage of visuals and audio, 
even if they are, yes, especially 
self-serious. But this was also the 
season in which a number of nar-
rative gambles — like the delayed 
“big reveal” in the first half of 
the season — simply didn’t work. 
Compared to its explosive first 
season, “Mr. Robot” this year was 
almost underwhelming. Is that 
the point, though? Are we now 
being ushered into an era of “Mr. 
Robot” in which the plot is almost 
perfunctory, and Elliot’s head is 
now the most volatile setting on 
TV? That’s a bit unnerving, to be 
honest; the best episode of this 
season, “Successor,” abandoned 
Elliot entirely. But the show’s web 
of plot is expanding just as our 
principals find the walls closing 
in on them. One can only hope 
Esmail finds intriguing and suc-
cessful ways of exploiting that 
dichotomy in the coming seasons.

ANY QUESTIONS?

Michigan 49, Penn State 10

I

t’s amazing how little 
you can learn from seven 
touchdowns.

The Michigan football team 

did that thing 
again, where 
it steamrolls 
an opponent 
so thoroughly 
that it 
feels like 
Marshawn 
Lynch is 
calling the 
shots. Over 
and over and 
over and 
over …. and over and over and 
over again — that’s how it went 
Saturday against Penn State. 
That’s how it’s gone all season 
long, one quarter excepted.

Wilton Speight said his team 

ran the same play “like, eight 
times in a row” on Saturday, 
flipping it back and forth. And 
if that doesn’t illustrate how 
thoroughly Michigan imposed 
its will, try the box score.

Penn State was 2-for-12 on 

third down. Michigan was 
11-for-16. The Wolverines posted 
515 offensive yards and held 
the Nittany Lions under 200. 
They’re still averaging 52 points. 
Still hard to block, still have 
Jabrill Peppers and yet there’s 
still not much to take away.

One-third of the way through 

the 2016 season, we know 
Michigan is good, but we have 
very little conception of how good 
because the Wolverines haven’t 
been forced to show all that much.

Outside of a few sweeps by 

Peppers and Eddie McDoom, 
Michigan’s offense has been largely 
vanilla and is still averaging 467 
yards a game. It pounded the ball 
for 326 yards against the Nittany 
Lions, and Speight still hasn’t been 
forced to take the kinds of shots he 

will soon need to.

In one week, mercifully, that 

should change.

Next Saturday, No. 11 

Wisconsin will roll in, undefeated 
and fresh off its second top-10 
win of the season. The Badgers 
beat No. 8 Michigan State on 
Saturday, using a stout defensive 
line and opportunistic secondary 
to all but assure a top-10 matchup 
against the Wolverines.

For the first time all season, 

Michigan can go in expecting 
a brawl. So far, the Wolverines 
have been throwing punches 
and catching the few thrown 
back at them.

Against Penn State, Michigan 

forced a three-and-out with two 
sacks on the game’s first series. 
Peppers nearly returned the 
ensuing punt for a touchdown, 
muffing it, picking it up, and then 
running it 53 yards down to the 
nine-yard line. He stumbled for 
the last 15 yards, and aside from 
that quarter against the Buffaloes, 
it might have been the longest the 
Wolverines have stumbled all year.

It was a drubbing, one that 

saw Michigan’s converted tight 
end Khalid Hill snag his fourth 
rushing touchdown of the year 
as a fullback and Speight go his 
third straight game without an 
interception.

The Wolverines dominated 

on both sides of the line of 
scrimmage, and for the fourth 
straight week, the backup 
quarterback saw the field. The 
defense added six more sacks 
and 13 tackles for loss.

These types of sentences 

aren’t supposed to be boring, 
but after four straight weeks of 
seeing Michigan do this, they are. 
Having 13 tackles for loss isn’t 
normal, but for the Wolverines, 
it’s pretty much the average.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Bo, Jim and the tradition that spans decades

Last week, Mark Donahue 

thought back to his days with 
Bo Schembechler, a man who 
established 
the program 
he played for 
at Michigan, 
a man he once 
carried off 
the field on 
his shoulders 
and one he 
will join in 
the Athletic 
Department’s 
Hall of Honor this weekend.

“He was always engaged,” 

Donahue said. “Every practice, 
he ran the offensive huddle, 
called every single play for the 
first team. … He was in the thick 
of it, every play, every moment. 
High energy level.”

His comments could just 

as easily have come from one 
of Michigan’s current players 
about Jim Harbaugh.

Three days after he spoke, the 

current Wolverines polished off 
a 49-10 trouncing of Penn State, 
in which they overpowered their 
opponent on both sides of the 
field, pounded the ball on the 
ground for 6.7 yards per carry 
and stifled the opposing offense 
to the tune of six sacks.

The win could just as 

easily have come from one of 
Michigan’s former teams.

The past and present intersect 

often around the winningest 
program in college football, and 
they will again this weekend. 
The Athletic Department will 
induct four members into its 
Hall of Honor this weekend, 
one being Donahue, who played 
offensive guard at Michigan 
from 1974 to 1977. At the game, 
Jim Harbaugh will coach the 
team, his father Jack will be an 
observer and Bo Schembechler 
will be watching from 
somewhere.

Donahue remembers the days 

of 40 years ago, when the roles 
were reversed — Schembechler 

coached the team, Jack assisted 
him and Jim was an observer. 
Schembechler’s Wolverines had 
lost to Ohio State in 1974, 12-10, 
and at home in 1975, 21-14, both 
to cede at least a share of the 
Big Ten championship to their 
archrival.

Finally, in 1976, they went 

down to Columbus and knocked 
off the Buckeyes, 22-0. After 
the game, Donahue and 
fellow offensive lineman Walt 
Downing carried Schembechler 
off the field on their shoulders. 
“I still remember the moment,” 
Donahue said.

Last month, 40 years after 

that day, Donahue received a call 
from Michigan Athletic Director 
Warde Manuel. The call was 
about returning to his alma 
mater, joining Schembechler in 
the Hall of Honor and watching 

Harbaugh, the man who once 
watched him.

Manuel said someone would 

call back to follow up with more 
details, and then a few weeks 
went by, and Donahue thought 
to himself: “Did I 
dream this up?”

“It is almost 

hard to express 
in terms of the 
realization that 
you’re in such 
a select group 
of athletes and 
representatives 
of the 
university,” 
Donahue said. 
“I’m proud of the fact to be 
associated with a group of 
people that I think represent 
the university well, both while 
they were attending there and 

after also.”

He will be back this weekend 

to remember his days playing for 
Schembechler and see the new 
coach built in his mold. Donahue 
was an All-American guard 

in 1976 and 
1977 and then 
an NFL Draft 
pick in 1978. 
Schembechler 
called Donahue 
one of the 
best offensive 
linemen he 
ever coached. 
Michigan never 
lost more than 
two games in a 

season during his career.

“From the time you’re 

a freshman there, it’s a 
great winning tradition,” 
Donahue said. “You sort of get 

inculturated, and it hits you 
when you get there. Even back 
in the ’70s, you felt like you were 
doing something special.”

People feel like that again 

around Ann Arbor these days. 
The Wolverines are ranked 
fourth in the country, their 
highest since 2006. They have 
started 4-0 and outscored 
their opponents by more than 
38 points per game. And they 
host No. 8 Wisconsin in a huge 
matchup Saturday at Michigan 
Stadium.

And their head coach is eerily 

similar to Schembechler from 
40 years ago as well. In those 
days, Harbaugh was 12, an eager 
apprentice to all of the coaches 
on Michigan’s staff, including 
his father and Schembechler. 
Now Harbaugh is back as the 
coach, but the same mentors 

still influence him. (He also, 
of course, borrowed his first 
remarks from Schembechler: “A 
lesser athlete would have gone 
down.”)

Just as Donahue’s comments 

about Schembechler could 
describe Harbaugh, his 
comments about Harbaugh 
could describe Schembechler.

“Seems like a very 

charismatic guy for the team, 
and is more focused on the 
team than external, so I think 
that’s always important — good 
leader.”

And now offensive line 

from one era will be welcomed 
back into another, a sign of the 
tradition carried on through the 
years. The program has endured 
rough patches in the meantime, 
but the ceremony this weekend 
could be another symbol of 
rebirth.

One of Schembechler’s players 

will return to find a team similar 
to his from the 1970s after seven 
years of disappointment. One 
of the best offensive linemen in 
program history will return to 
find a revamped offensive line 
that was the team’s weakness in 
2013 and 2014. Donahue, like all 
former players, spoke about how 
he enjoys seeing Michigan back 
on the upswing.

Donahue’s name isn’t 

discussed today on the same 
level as others like Howard 
and Woodson and Brady. But 
four decades later, he serves 
as a reminder of a past the 
Wolverines cherish so deeply.

Perhaps Donahue’s name 

will even come up this week 
as part of that tradition in the 
Wolverines’ game preparation. 
The offensive lineman 
remembers similar stories from 
when he was a player. Upon his 
return 40 years later, he might 
just find that he still fits in.

Wolverines keep 
Barkley in check

At the end of the third quarter 

of the No. 4 Michigan football 
team’s blowout victory over Penn 
State, the Nittany Lions had a 
pedestrian 121 total yards of 
offense. The more astounding part 
of that statistic, though, was that 
running back Saquon Barkley had 
131 of them.

That’s not a typo — Barkley was 

outgaining the rest of his team 131 
yards to negative-10. Until wide 
receiver Chris Godwin added a 
fourth-quarter touchdown later 
in the game, the sophomore 
running back appeared to be the 
only functioning part of an offense 
that fell victim to six sacks and 13 
tackles for loss.

As a result, other than perhaps 

quarterback 
Trace 
McSorley, 

Barkley was the player with the 
biggest target on his back for the 
Michigan defense all afternoon.

“We knew that Barkley was 

one of the best players, if not the 
best player on the offensive side,” 
said fifth-year senior defensive 
end Chris Wormley. “So we knew 
when we shut down the run, 
we could get to the quarterback 
with blitzes and different things 
that (defensive coordinator Don) 
Brown has us do.”

The defensive line ended up 

following that plan to the letter, 
holding the dangerous runner 
to just 3.9 yards per carry out of 
the backfield. Barkley did rip off 
a 33-yard run early in the third 
quarter to kickstart a drive that 
put Penn State on the scoreboard, 
but the Wolverines tackled him for 
a loss three times and didn’t allow 
another run longer than six yards.

The Nittany Lions’ offensive 

line, a work in progress that has 
frequently struggled to protect its 
quarterback in recent years, was 
mostly ineffective against one of 
the best defensive fronts in the 
country. As a result, Barkley often 
found himself on the receiving 
end of big multi-man tackles after 
half of Michigan’s defensive line 

successfully broke through.

“That’s a heck of a good 

back,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “Saquon Barkley is 
a good football player. He got 
out, got a couple (big plays) — he 
showed that a few times. But for 
the most part, our guys were there 
and swarming. They were coming 
two, three, four at a time. I thought 
it was impressive.”

With the run game proving 

futile, Barkley found a better way 
to beat the Wolverines: rolling 
out of the backfield and using his 
hands. In the first half, he caught 
two passes and found open space 
to rack up a total of 47 yards. Only 
one other Penn State receiver even 
had positive yardage.

Knowing that Barkley was 

probably the only player who could 
beat them, Michigan’s defensive 
players went into the locker room 
and decided that they needed to 
take away that part of his game.

“We 
focused 
on 
that 
at 

halftime,” said senior linebacker 
Ben Gedeon. “We knew he’s a 
good receiver, he can go out of the 
backfield. As linebackers, in our 
man coverage stuff, we had to kind 
of take the air out of him.”

At first, that plan didn’t work 

out so well for the Wolverines, as 
Barkley took a 19-yard reception 
into the red zone on Penn State’s 
first drive, only narrowly being 
forced out of bounds at the 7-yard 
line. The next two times Barkley 
caught the ball, though, Gedeon 
was ready for him, teaming up with 
senior safety Delano Hill and then 
redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Maurice Hurst to hit Barkley and 
hold him to gains of just five and 
six yards, respectively.

Even with Barkley’s few big 

plays, the outcome of the game 
was never really in doubt. But with 
No. 11 Wisconsin coming to Ann 
Arbor next week and bringing 
in talented running back Corey 
Clement, 
neutralizing 
Barkley 

should prove to be a good warmup 
for a defense that was otherwise 
barely tested on Saturday.

FOOTBALL
Higdon has breakout game in win

At a slight 5-foot-10 and 189 

pounds, Karan Higdon doesn’t fit 
the picture of an old-school Big 
Ten running back. But Saturday, 
as he raced down the left sideline 
for a 40-yard touchdown — the 
longest run of his career — the 
sophomore proved he was right 
where he belonged.

The touchdown wasn’t of vital 

importance to the Wolverines 
(1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 overall), who 
were already up by 25 points 
and would ultimately rout Penn 
State, 49-10, but it proved to be 
the exclamation point on a nine-
carry, 81-yard game for Higdon.

Last season, he barely saw 

the field. In his biggest game 
of 2015, he carried the ball 
eight times for 16 yards against 
Northwestern. Other than that, 
he didn’t have any standout 
games, and his less-than-ideal 
freshman season closed with a 
grand total of 19 yards.

He was knocked down another 

peg when he couldn’t compete 
in most of spring and summer 
conditioning due to a bout of 
mononucleosis and a knee injury. 
After he sat out all of fall camp, 
he admitted it was “mentally 
challenging” 
to 
watch 
his 

teammates get better while he sat 
back and watched. 

But he surprised everyone 

when he got back to practice just 
a week before the Hawaii game 
and showed a glimpse of what 
he could do. Maybe this season 
would be different. 

“Aw man, it has been a hectic 

freshman campaign, but to roll 
over from that adversity and just 
to keep moving and keep striving 
and having guys like Coach 
Wheatley and Coach Harbaugh 
constantly in my ear, pushing 
me, pushing me, pushing me, 
it just leads to great things,” 
Higdon said.

“I didn’t go at all during fall 

camp. I got back last week before 
the Hawaii game. To get back and 
have the season that I’m having, 
I’m feeling pretty good.” 

So on Saturday, when redshirt 

sophomore quarterback Wilton 

Speight handed him the ball 
just past midfield in the fourth 
quarter, 
he 
shook 
off 
any 

remaining demons from the 
past year. He cut toward the left 
sideline, slipped through the 
arms of a Penn State defender and 
burst forward, with no one within 
reach of him. The touchdown was 
his second of the game and just 
the third of his career. 

“Really, I think, that was a 

Tyrone 
Wheatley 
feel,” 
said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“He got Karan in there early and 
saw some real explosive runs, and 
I think that’s just something that 
coach Wheatley had seen and got 
him in there. He reeled off some 
impressive runs early. I mean, 
physical, hitting-the-hole fast, 
explosive-type of runs.

“Same on the touchdown. 

That was an exciting run, a very 
explosive run. I thought he was 
just shot out like he was coming 
out of the starting blocks. A heck 
of a good run.”

And really, he started shaking 

off last year in the very first game 
of the season. Against Hawaii, he 

carried the ball six times, turning 
one of those opportunities into 
his first-ever touchdown. 

“It feels great to see my 

hard work paying off, but that 
goes credit to my work and 
everybody in the running back 
room pushing each other and 
competing with each other,” 
Higdon said. “We got some great 
backs in the running backs room, 
and as they continue to increase 
their skill, I do the same.”

Higdon is just one of many 

running backs that Harbaugh 
has used in 2016 — freshman 
Chris Evans, senior De’Veon 
Smith and redshirt junior Ty 
Isaac 
have 
all 
contributed 

significantly this season. With 
the number of backs being 
used, Wheatley had to make the 
unit competitive yet cohesive. 
Earlier this week, he said that 
what happens in the running 
backs room is like Vegas: What’s 
discussed there stays there. For 
players like Higdon, that just 
helps them even more. 

“You see one guy who makes 

a heck of a play during practice, 

turn around, and you make a 
heck of a play, then the next guy,” 
Higdon said. “It’s like, ‘Whoa,’ 
you’re always excited to see those 
guys produce, as well as yourself, 
so I would say that’s what Vegas 
is like.” 

No one told him that he’d 

be 
seeing 
an 
increase 
in 

opportunities on Saturday. That’s 
just the way the team operates. 
The same amount of preparation 
goes into each game.

Still, Higdon was able to 

emerge from the pack and seize 
some of the spotlight, a move he 
credited to his hard work and 
faith. After Saturday’s game, he 
met with reporters wearing a 
golden chain that featured both 
a cross and a football. He bought 
it on his birthday earlier this 
month. “It just reminds me each 
and every day who I’m doing it 
for and what I’m doing it for,” he 
said.

Asked if Saturday was his 

breakout game, though, Higdon 
wasn’t ready to go that far.

“No,” he said, “I just consider it 

a productive day.”

Dominant second half powers ‘M’

The last time the Michigan 

women’s 
soccer 
team 
faced 

Michigan State, it suffered a 
bruising 
3-0 
loss 

in 
East 

Lansing — 
its first loss to its in-state rival 
since 2011. But the Wolverines 
returned to their winning ways 
Saturday night, defeating the 
Spartans, 1-0. 

Behind 
an 
electrifying 

second-half performance that 
Michigan 
coach 
Greg 
Ryan 

called “our best half of soccer of 
the year”, the Wolverines (3-0 
Big Ten, 7-1-1 overall) completely 
overpowered Michigan State 
(1-2, 4-5-1), which simply had no 
answer for them. 

“They terrorized Michigan 

State in the second half,” Ryan 
said. “I mean, they just couldn’t 
catch their breath.”

While the two teams were 

locked in a physical, gritty 
battle in the first half — both 
finished 
with 
double-digit 

fouls — Michigan came alive 
and imposed its will on the 
match before the second whistle 
sounded. Adopting an aggressive 
approach, the Wolverines went 
after the Spartans, winning 
tackles all over the pitch and 
making it nearly impossible 
for Michigan State to complete 
a pass. Every time a Spartan 
so much as touched the ball, 
a blue shirt raced to rapidly 
recover possession. It was a 
tactic redshirt junior forward 
Ani 
Sarkisian 
described 
as 

“(blowing) up their rhythm.”

The persistent pressure made 

life easy for Michigan goalkeeper 
Sarah Jackson, who needed to 
make only one save during the 
entire game. The same cannot 
be said of Spartan goalkeeper 
Savanna Wojtanowski.

Wojtanowski had her work 

cut out for her from the outset, 
as the Wolverines bombarded 
her early and often, totaling 
20 shots on goal. In the second 
half, it was more of the same. 
Whether 
it 
was 
Sarkisian, 

senior forward Nicky Waldeck 
or sophomore midfielder Abby 
Kastroll — who each had five of 
those shots — Wojtanowski was 
under constant fire.

A 15-minute span in the 

second half proved especially 
challenging for Wojtanowski, 
whose team simply couldn’t 
hold onto the ball long enough to 
relieve the strain.

Sophomore forward Reilly 

Martin sprung Waldeck into 
space with a cross in behind the 
defense, and even with a heavy 
first 
touch, 
Waldeck 
came 

close to beating the keeper to 
the ball and pulling off a chip 
shot. Sarkisian followed with a 
cross over the top of the defense 
toward an open Waldeck, and 
Wojtanowski had to make a 

kick save recovery to keep the 
ball out.

Kastroll 
joined 
the 
fray 

soon thereafter, weaving her 
way through the defense on 
a run down the right flank 
and firing a shot from inside 
the box. Wojtanowski made 
the initial save again, but the 
rebound went straight back to 
Kastroll, whose second attempt 
was cleared off the line by a 
Michigan State defender.

“I thought their goalie made 

some really good plays on the 
day,” Ryan said. “When you’re 
hitting the post, and you’re 
making the goalie make saves, 
you’re doing everything right. 
You just gotta keep taking your 
chances. They’ll start to fall.”

It was only a matter of time 

until Michigan would find the 
back of the net.

Sarkisian 
provided 
the 

breakthrough 
in 
the 
76th 

minute, as she burst into the box 
unmarked and put her head on 

the end of Martin’s cross from 
distance. The ball sailed through 
the air and nestled softly into 
the bottom left corner of the 
goal in picture-perfect fashion. 
This time, Wojtanowski had no 
chance.

“You don’t see them like that 

very often,” Ryan said. “Great 
way to win the game.”

While avenging the sting 

from 
last 
season’s 
loss 

admittedly 
felt 
good, 
the 

Wolverines know it is a small 
victory in a long journey ahead.

“Our goal is Big Ten champs, 

and yeah they’re a big rivalry 
team and it’s important that 
we win this game, but it’s just 
as important to win any other 
game,” Sarkisian said. “We 
want to go undefeated in the Big 
Ten. That’s our goal, so every 
team is a good team, and every 
team in the Big Ten is very 
(competitive). Hopefully we’ll 
continue on like this the rest of 
the season.”

Michigan splits first 
conference weekend

Friday night, the Michigan 

women’s volleyball team found 
itself in an uncharacteristic 
position.

The team went into conference 

play against No. 1 Nebraska on 
Friday with an impressive 11-1 
regular-season record — and 
went out with an 0-1 record for 
the Big Ten.

Not exactly the way they 

had hoped the start of their 
conference play would go, the 
Wolverines had less then 24 
hours to turn things around 
before hosting Iowa on Saturday. 
And while there were still some 
consistency issues against the 
Hawkeyes, Michigan managed 
to switch gears for a four-set win 
to end the weekend 1-1.

In the first match of the 

weekend, 
the 
22nd-ranked 

Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten, 12-2 
overall) dropped the first three 
sets against the Cornhuskers, 
22-25, 
25-20 
and 
25-18 
to 

record their first Big Ten loss 
— and second loss overall — of 
the season. Nebraska tallied 
five more kills than Michigan 
and had seven fewer errors, 
which resulted in a .234 attack 
percentage, almost double the 
Wolverines’ .118.

Fifth-year 
senior 
outside 

hitter Kelly Murphy led the 
offense with 10 kills, followed 
closely 
by 
senior 
middle 

blocker Abby Cole, who had 
nine. Sophomore libero Jenna 
Lerg contributed 10 of the 47 
total digs, with Murphy adding 
nine to top the Cornhuskers in 
digs, 47-43.

“Nebraska gave us a great 

barometer of where we’re going 
and where we want to be,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“I thought that, physically, we 
played with them for 85 percent 
of the match — we were right 

there, toe to toe with them. 
There wasn’t a situation where 
I thought, ‘Man, we just can’t 
stop this player’ or ‘We’re 
overmatched here.’

“Where we were different 

was the other 15 percent, and 
that’s being able to execute on 
a consistent basis. That’s where 
Nebraska is ahead of us, they’re 
just more consistent. But that 
gives us a great gauge to where 
we’re going.”

Michigan turned around on 

Saturday to face Iowa, where 
the Wolverines pushed their 
conference record to 1-1 with a 
four-set win, 25-21, 25-19, 25-27 
and 25-17.

The 
Wolverine 
offense 

dominated the match, with three 
athletes recording double-digit 
kills. Murphy and junior outside 
hitter Adeja Lambert recorded 12 
kills apiece, while Cole added 11 
for the combined team total of 53 
and a team attack average of .279.

“I thought Adeja did a great 

job this weekend,” Rosen said. 
“She’s been battling in practice 
to get in the lineup and I thought 
she did a great job. Especially 
tonight, she came out at the very 
beginning and kind of set the 
tone with two big kills right off 
the bat and a block at right that 
kind of got things going.”

Lambert had the second-

highest amount of digs on the 
team, falling two short of Lerg, 
who led with eight.

Redshirt freshman middle 

blocker Cori Crocker also had a 
great match, tallying a career-
high eight blocks on defense 
and five kills on offense. She 
finished the night with a .714 
attack average.

“It’s really exciting to be 

able to come out and play in the 
best conference every single 
night,” Crocker said. “It’s great 
to know that everyone you’re 
playing is the best competition 
in the country.”

Wolverines top Ohio State, fall to Penn State

With former players in town 

for alumni weekend, the current 
No. 8 Michigan field hockey team 
faced two strong conference 
opponents for the first time 
this weekend. The Wolverines 
defeated Ohio State (0-2 Big 
Ten, 3-6 overall) 1-0 on Friday 
night, but fell to No. 4 Penn State 
(2-1 Big Ten, 9-1 overall) 3-1 on 
Sunday afternoon.

Despite 
its 
win 
Friday 

evening, Michigan had a hard 
time capitalizing on offensive 
opportunities 
throughout 

both games. The Wolverines 
had 15 shots on net, but just 
a few were legitimate goal-
scoring 
opportunities. 
Still, 

freshman forward Fay Keijer 
scored the game-winning goal 
during the first half of Friday’s 
game against the Buckeyes, 
which was a deflection into the 
upper netting after freshman 
midfielder Meg Dowthwaite’s 
initial penalty-corner shot.

“We did it as a team,” Keijer 

said. “We worked so hard and 
fought until the end because this 
was a very close game. I don’t 
really think it was just my goal.”

Sophomore forward Emma 

Way finished a chance off 
a 
corner, 
but 
Ohio 
State 

challenged the call and it was 
disallowed by the referees for 
being too high. 

After halftime, the game 

turned into a defensive battle, 
culminating in a high shot 
from the Buckeyes that junior 
goaltender 
Sam 
Swenson 

batted away with three minutes 
remaining. That attempt was 
Ohio State’s only on-net shot of 
the game.

Though the Buckeyes did 

not generate many traceable 
offensive opportunities, they 
kept the ball in Michigan’s 
defensive zone for much of the 
second half. The Wolverines 
were forced to defend five 
penalty 
corners, 
but 
they 

held strong and sealed the 1-0 
victory.

“We were having trouble 

breaking the ball out of the 
defense today,” said Michigan 
coach 
Marcia 
Pankratz 
on 

Friday. 
“We 
were 
a 
little 

unsteady there.”

The 
Wolverines 
made 

adjustments in practice Saturday 
to correct that, but their miscues 
came back to bite them, as they 
were caught sleeping at the start 
of 
Sunday’s 

game. 
The 

Nittany Lions 
burst 
past 

Michigan 
and 
tipped 

in their first 
goal just 38 
seconds 
into 

the game. Six 
minutes later 
they racked up 
another 
goal 

during the second effort on a 
penalty corner.

“We tried to get back to the 

game plan” Pankratz said. “We 
just unfortunately didn’t play 
the whole 70 minutes. We were 
10 minutes late.

“By then we were really 

scrambling to come back and 
it’s tough to do that against a 
great team like Penn State. But 
I was proud of how we turned it 
around … and I thought it was an 
even game the second half.”

Despite the tough first half, 

Michigan seemed encouraged 
by the alumni who were honored 

on the field at 
halftime and 
began leading 
the 
fans 
in 

chants during 
the 
second 

half.

But 
that 

wasn’t enough 
to 
help 
the 

Wolverines, 
as 
the 

scoreboard 

reflected the even-matched play 
the rest of the game. Way finally 
earned a spot for Michigan 
on the board with less than 10 
minutes left in the game, with 
an assist from junior midfielder 
Katie Trombetta. Once again, 

the goal came from a penalty 
corner. The Nittany Lions tallied 
one more late goal with just 3:42 
left in the game to solidify their 
win. 

“We just need to finish more 

on our corners,” Way said. “We 
had a lot of opportunities and 
they’re the number one scoring 
part of the game.”

Added Trombetta: “I think 

each game we’re getting better, 
we’re building more, getting 
more confident. I think today 
we kind of let the hectic-ness 
get to us. We started to dribble a 
lot more, so we have to go to our 
basic of passing.”

Michigan 
is 
entering 
a 

crucial point of its season — 
gearing up to face conference 
opponents for the next three 
weekends in a row. Unlike its 
10-0 cakewalk against Central 
Michigan last week, the stakes 
are higher as conference play 
begins. The Wolverines will 
have to tweak their offense — 
or at least their penalty corners 
— in order to be successful.

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Michigan opens fall 
season at Virginia

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

tennis team kicked off its 2016 
fall season this weekend with 
just three players competing 
at the UVA Fall Invitational in 
Charlottesville, Va.

The 
Wolverines 
started 

the tournament with a sweep 
Friday, as sophomores Kara 
Hall and Alex Najarian and 
freshman Chiara Lommer all 
won their matches in two sets. 
Najarian gave up only one game 
each set.

But Michigan was unable 

to carry its success into the 
doubles matches. Lommer and 
Najarian 
were 

defeated by two 
pairs of players 
from 
Marshall 

and Utah by an 
eight-game pro-
set score of 8-6 
in each match.

Even though 

the Wolverines 
donned 
the 

maize 
and 

blue 
at 
the 

Invitational, 
they 
competed 

as 
individuals 
and 
didn’t 

accumulate team points.

“We have a certain number 

of dates that we have,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein, “and if we bring less 
than four (players) it doesn’t 
count as a team date. Everybody 
will basically play four events 
this fall, so we just had these 
three go this weekend.”

Saturday 
was 
another 

day of mixed results for the 
Wolverines. 
Najarian 
swept 

players from Old Dominion 
and Virginia to advance to her 
flight’s finals, while Hall was 
defeated by competitors from 
Virginia and Virginia Tech.

The tournament concluded 

Sunday, with Najarian taking 
on Old Dominion’s Borislava 
Botusharova 
in 
the 
flight’s 

finals. 
Botusharova 
proved 

too strong of an opponent for 
Najarian, and she fell 6-1, 6-1.

Hall 
and 
Lommer 
also 

competed Sunday in eight-game 
pro-set consolation matches. 
Lommer 
defeated 
Utah’s 

Jenna Chang, 8-1. Hall also 
participated in an 8-1 match, 
but Hall was defeated, 8-1, by 
Utah’s Alexia Petrovic. Hall and 
Najarian were also defeated by 
a duo from Virginia, 7-6 (2), in 
their flight’s consolation match.

“I think with Alex, even 

though she lost today, she 
played really well for the most 

part,” Bernstein 
said. “I think the 
biggest thing we 
really need to 
work on is our 
doubles. 
That 

was 
probably 

the 
area 
we 

could have done 
a lot better.”

Fall 
season 

losses 
aren’t 

all that bad for 

a team, though. Rankings and 
conference standings are based 
on results from the winter season 
— when dual matches occur — 
and the fall season is often used 
as a time for players to get back 
into the groove of things after 
a summer of inactivity. The fall 
season also allows for teams to 
figure out shortcomings before 
the winter season.

“The fall is great,” Bernstein 

said. “It doesn’t have the 
same pressure as it does team 
against team, so you just hope 
they can relax a little bit and 
work on some things. It gives 
us a good opportunity to work 
with the kids and get matches 
under their belt before we start 
in January.”

Najarian, Hall and Lommer only ‘M’ 
players to compete; Najarian goes 3-1

That’s why next week should be 

so fun. Colorado might have come 
out and punched Michigan in the 
mouth last week, but the Badgers 
are built to do it for longer than 
a quarter. The Wolverines might 
have to open that playbook a little 
wider, deploy Peppers with more 
offensive regularity or use what 
seems like it could be a stellar goal-
line defense, if it was ever needed.

Saturday, Penn State coach 

James Franklin elected to kick on 
4th-and-goal from the 2-yard line. 
His team was down 28-0.

After the game, Franklin told 

reporters he just wanted to get 
points out of that possession, and 
that’s a statement in itself. But next 
week, finally, Michigan will have a 
chance to make a louder one.

The good, the bad and the ugly: Michigan 49, Penn State 10

Another 
week, 
another 

blowout.

The 
Michigan 
football 

team dominated every facet 
of its fourth game of the 
season Saturday, outgaining 
Penn State by more than 300 
total 
yards 
and 
emerging 

as 
39-point 
victors. 
While 

the 
Wolverines 
weren’t 

quite 
perfect, 
the 
Nittany 

Lions never threatened, and 
Michigan was once again able 
to put in its backups.

Here’s the good, bad and ugly 

from Saturday’s game:

The good

Michigan 
owned 
the 

run game. The Wolverines 
rushed for 326 yards and held 

Penn State to just 70. Even 
with the Nittany Lions’ star 
running back Saquon Barkley 
finding moments of success, 
Michigan controlled the line 
of scrimmage and bottled up 
Barkley.

While 
there 
were 
still 

a couple of big plays, the 
Wolverines were notably better 
at limiting them. Penn State’s 
longest play of the game went 
for 33 yards, but outside of that 
rush, Barkley averaged fewer 
than two yards per carry.

On the opposite side of the 

ball, Michigan’s offensive line 
got great push. The Wolverines 
gained 6.1 yards per play, and 
in the run game, that number 
was even higher at 6.7. Pro 
Football Focus College rated 
fifth-year senior right tackle 
Erik Magnuson as Michigan’s 
top 
offensive 
player, 
and 

sophomore left tackle Grant 
Newsome was second. That’s a 
great sign for the Wolverines in 
conference play.

In the secondary, senior 

cornerback 
Jourdan 
Lewis 

made his return, and while he 
wasn’t totally thrilled with his 
performance, he did have a pass 
breakup and a tackle for loss.

The bad

James 
Franklin. 
In 
the 

second 
meeting 
between 

Franklin and Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
the 
latter 

completely 
outsmarted 
the 

former.

In the most notable instance, 

Franklin sent out the field goal 
team on 4th-and-goal from the 
2-yard line, then called timeout 
to think it over, then sent out 
the field goal unit again. Oh, 

and his team was down 28-0 in 
the second half.

Harbaugh, 
meanwhile, 

was aggressive as always. His 
team was ready from the start, 
and while the play calling 
was 
mostly 
simple, 
there 

were a couple of fun wrinkles 
sprinkled in. Using Jabrill 
Peppers as an offensive decoy 
on one play, De’Veon Smith 
was able to find space for a 
39-yard gain.

With a weapon like Barkley 

on his team, it’s hard to believe 
Penn State had so little success 
in the run game, or even by 
using his presence as a threat.

The ugly

There’s only really one ugly 

thing that can come out of a 
game like Saturday’s.

Fifth-year senior cornerback 

Jeremy Clark, who had been 
seeing 
increased 
playing 

time 
in 
Lewis’ 
absence 

and performing among the 
conference’s 
best, 
left 
the 

game on a cart. After the game, 
Harbaugh feared the injury 
was to Clark’s anterior cruciate 
ligament. “We think it’s a 
season-ender,” he worried.

If Clark is indeed out for the 

year, it will be a bitter end for 
a player who converted from 
safety and worked his way into 
significant playing time for the 
Wolverines.

Clark is on a team that is 

contending for a Big Ten title, 
and maybe the College Football 
Playoff, and now it seems he 
may not get to be on the field 
for any of that.

Ugly is one way to put it. 

Heartbreaking might be more 
fitting.
