Ron Weiser, 

namesake of Weiser 
Hall, launches 2016 

candidacy 

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

Former 
U.S. 
Ambassador 

to 
Slovakia, 
Ron 
Weiser 

announced his decision to run 
for 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Regent 
in 
a 
press 
release 

Monday.

Weiser, 
a 
Republican, 

highlighted issues of tuition 
as his main concern. In an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily, 
he 
emphasized 
that 

his 
business 
background 

would provide him with an 
advantage in fulfilling the goal 
of reduced tuition rates. Weiser 
founded McKinley Associates 
Inc., a prominent real estate 
investment firm, in 1968. He 
served as chair and CEO until 

2001.

“I think this is a great 

university,” Weiser said. “It’s 
well run, but there’s always 
room for improvement, and 
having a business perspective is 
an added perspective that they 
don’t have right now.”

Currently 
one 

businesswoman, Denise Illitch 
(D), serves on the Board of 
Regents — she is president of 
Ilitch Enterprises, owner of 
Denise Ilitch Designs, owner 
and publisher of Ambasador 

Magazine.

Both regents whose terms are 

expiring at the end of this year, 
Ilitch and Laurence Deitch (D) 
have not yet announced if they 
will run for re-election on the 
Board.

In 
addition 
to 
focusing 

on tuition costs, Wesier said 
he 
opposes 
policies 
that 

provide 
in-state 
tuition 
to 

undocumented 
students. 

Currently,

Governor calls for 4.3 
percent funding bump 

for universities

By EMMA KINERY

Daily News Editor

After an initial 15 percent slash 

to higher education funding when 
he first entered office in 2011, Gov. 
Rick Snyder (R) announced he 
intends to return funding levels 
to pre-2011 levels in his 2017 - 
2018 
budget 
recommendation 

Wednesday. 

Snyder’s 
budget 

recommendation 
included 
an 

allocation of $61.2 million to 
go 
towards 
higher 
education 

institutions, which equates to a 
4.3 percent increase in funding. 
The increase is over double the 2 
percent allocated last year.

In his budget recommendation, 

Snyder said he aimed for a 
minimum of 60 percent of state 
residents to have a degree or 
credential by 2025. The 60 percent 
figure is one of several goals in a 
December report on Michigan’s 
workforce and higher education, 
released by a working group of 

state legislators, nonprofits and 
colleges.

Dave Murray, Snyder’s press 

secretary, 
said 
the 
increase 

in higher education funds is 
important for both students and 
the state economy.

“Governor Snyder recognizes 

that Michigan’s institution of 
higher education play a vital role 
in our state’s comeback,” Murray 
said. “Every family wants their 
children to be able to graduate and 
get a job right here and not have to 
leave Michigan to find those great 
jobs. By increasing our investment, 
we’re helping students get the 
skills they need and also to help our 
industry create more, better jobs 
that they know there will be people 
graduating with those skills. That’s 
good for Michigan now, and long 
into the future.”

The University’s Ann Arbor 

campus will receive a 4.2 percent 
increase in funding equating to 
$299,975,000 for operational costs 
and an additional $12,718,500 for 
performance funding — the largest 
sum allocated by the state to a 
university — contingent on meeting 
cap on tuition increase levied by 
the state. The University’s Flint and

Party platform goals 
include appointing a 
student to Board of 

Regents

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

As elections for Central Student 

Government draw closer, new 
parties are emerging to take on the 

prevailing Make Michigan ticket.

newMICH, a platform aimed 

at increasing transparency and 
student voice on the assembly, 
is among the first to announce 
theircandidacy, along with Your 
Michigan. Leading the party’s 
executive ticket are LSA juniors 
David Schafer and Micah Griggs, 
both current CSG representatives, 
running for president and vice 
president 
respectively. 
LSA 

sophomore 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 

who 
is 
currently 
on 
CSG’s 

executive committee as the chief 
programming officer, will serve as 
newMICH’s campaign manager.

Sarkar said the newMICH 

platform surfaced through the 
reorganization 
and 
rebranding 

of both the The Team and Make 
Michigan, the top two rival 
platforms fromlast year’s election.

For the past two years, CSG’s 

executive positions have been held 
by the Make Michigan platform.

Marlanna Landeros 
recognized by OIE 
for programming

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

For Marlanna Landeros, the 

University of Michigan Division 
of Public Safety and Security’s 
program manager, public safety at 
the University is in her blood.

Landeros 
is 
one 
of 
10 

individual recipients of this year’s 
Distinguished Diversity Leaders 
Award, and was recognized last 
week by the Office of Institutional 
Equity as the force behind DPSS 
programs aimed at making the 
department diversity-concious.

The Distinguished Diversity 

Leaders 
Award 
celebrates 

University 
members 
working 

toward creating an inclusive 
working 
environment. 
The 

award is made possible by the 

Office of the Provost and Human 
Resources, and winners recieve 
money to use for professional 
development activities. 

Though her position as student 

program manager is new in the 
department this year, Landeros is 
no stranger to campus safety and 
security. She has held multiple 
positions with DPSS since 2002, 
and noted that her mother and 
father were also involved in 
similar public safety work while 
she was growing up. 

“My dad was director of public 

safety at UM-Flint,” she explained. 
“I learned the importance and 
value of diversity; it looked a little 
different when they were part of 
policing. And I gained a passion 
for wanting to make a difference.”

Much of her work this year has 

been focused on implementing 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s 
diversity 
initiative. 

Every department and unit on 
campus has been tasked with 
developing a unique strategic 

plan to address diversity that will 
ultimately be combined into one 
cohesive plan in the fall.

“The structure we’ve built is 

designed to encourage discussion, 
the 
sharing 
of 
successful 

programs and the development 
of new ideas,” Schlissel said at 
theintroduction of the initiative 
last September. “We want to 
encourage 
innovation 
to 
set 

broad parameters; not prescribed 
boxes.”

Landeros 
said 
for 
DPSS, 

implementing those instructions 
has meant orchestrating dialogues 
with other departments as well as 
creating safe spaces for students 
to communicate with University 
police. On multiple occasions, 
she said, she had to demonstrate 
DPSS’s presence in the planning 
initiative to other departments. 

“With the call to action from the 

president, people know we must 
move forward,” she said. “And 
(the plan) brings together a lot of 
people that would not intersect 

and have a conversation on this 
subject matter. Verifying to 
other groups that we’re here has 
been very important.”

The intersection of diversity 

and policing is a sensitive 
one in many communities, 
including at the University, as 
minority students have voiced 
complaints of feeling unsafe 
on campus over past years. 
The City Council’s Human 
Rights Commission recently 
recommended that the city 
institute a police review board 
after the death of Aura Rosser, 
a Black woman fatally shot by 
an Ann Arbor police officer in 
2014. 

In response to a question 

about similar programs on 
college 
campuses, 
such 
as 

Michigan 
State 
University’s 

recent creation of an Inclusions 
and 
Anti-Bias 
Unit 
and 

whether DPSS would consider 
instituting one, Landeros to the 
unit’s data collection as a part of 
the strategic plan.

“We’re still seeking data 

there before we make any 
decisions,” she said.

Ann Arbor project 

may be revived, 

but details remain 

uncertain

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

Tuesday, University of Michi-

gan President Mark Schlissel 
reintroduced the idea of creating 
a rapid transit system between 
Central and North Campuses, a 
project that had essentially been 
dormant since 2013.

“The city would probably con-

tribute a modest amount, but not 
an amount that changes a $60 
million project into something 
we don’t know how to do right 
now,” Schlissel said during the 
chat.

In 2010, under then-President 

Mary Sue Coleman, the Univer-
sity of Michigan began discuss-
ing plans with the City of Ann 
Arbor to build a new transporta-
tion system that would effective-
ly unify the University’s entire 
Ann Arbor campus, stretching 
as far east as the East Medical 
Campus on Plymouth Road and 
as far south as Wolverine Tow-
ers near Briarwood Mall.

In 2011, the University and 

the city collaborated with the 
Ann Arbor Area Transporta-
tion Authority and the Ann 
Arbor 
Downtown 
Develop-

ment Authority to fund a study 
investigating 
the 
feasibility 

of such a rapid transit system. 
The study considered light rail, 
bus rapid transit, monorail and 
streetcar as potential modes of 
transportation, finding that the 
current and projected levels of 
ridership justified high-capac-
ity service in the “high demand 
core” 
encompassing 
Central 

and North Campuses, as well as 
“end-to-end connection” from 
the Briarwood Mall area to the 
East Medical Campus.

There were a series of public 

meetings in 2013 to discuss the 
future of the so-called Connec-

tor program, but the program 
hasn’t received any public atten-
tion since.

“That was the first I’d heard 

that idea surface in the last few 
years,” Ann Arbor City Council-
member Sabra Briere (D–Ward 
1) said in an interview with the 
Daily.

Briere said she understood 

the demand for a rapid transit 
system, though.

“The biggest, most congested 

area of University transporta-
tion is between Central Campus 
and North Campus. A bus is en 
route between those two desti-
nations several times a minute,” 
she said.

Engineering freshman Hosse-

in Abdollahi, a resident of Bates 
Housing, knows this struggle all 
too well.

“Living on North Campus 

was particularly difficult with 
the current transit system as 
most of my classes had nothing 
to do with engineering and were 
located on Central Campus,” 
Abdollahi wrote in an e-mail. 
“The commute to Central was 
awful because everyone would 
be trying to get to the same place 
and so buses would be packed.”

Schlissel said at his fireside 

talk that for North Campus to 
expand as he hoped, improve-
ments in transportation would 
be necessary. Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor had similar 
sentiments.

“Traffic and congestion are 

important quality of life issues 
for everyone in Ann Arbor and 
the University community, and 
outside the University commu-
nity,” Taylor said. “We all expect 
the University to continue to 
grow and expand and improve 
its educational and research and 
medical offerings, to integrate 
campuses and to provide the 
free and easy flow of persons 
from, broadly speaking, North 
Campus to Central to South 
Campus.”

Taylor said if the transporta-

tion project was to go through, 
the University, not the city, 
would be the recipient of federal 

grants. Though no statement has 
been issued by the University on 
how the funds for this project 
would be raised, Abdollahi says 
bearing a tuition hike is a con-
sideration he would make.

“I’d be willing to pay extra 

depending on how reasonable 
the amount he’s asking for is,” 
Abdollahi said. “However, I 
would first like to make sure that 
there is no other way to raise the 
funds.”

Engineering 
senior 
Anya 

LaRoche doesn’t think the time 
the transit system would save 
would be worth the cost.

“I think that a lot of people are 

already very financially strained 
with what they already have to 
pay,” LaRoche said.

Regarding its own involve-

ment 
with 
the 
Connector 

project, Central Student Gov-
ernment issued this statement:

“CSG has been working close-

ly with Busing to adjust current 
bus routes and cater to North 
Campus 
Student’s 
Gameday 

transportation needs since the 
Fall semester. We have engaged 
in the long term plan conversa-
tion, focusing on innovative and 
clean 
energy 
transportation. 

CSG understands the long-term 
nature of this plan, however 
is committed to maintaining a 
strong voice both in the present, 
and in the distant future.”

As far as the timeline for the 

project or its estimated comple-
tion date, things are very much 
still in the dark.

“We don’t have an estimated 

start date. This is nebulous and 
still in the planning stages. It’s 
not even in the proposal stage,” 
Briere said. “The last meeting 
I attended, we still didn’t have 
any sense of what would be cre-
ated to service the transporta-
tion model.”

That meeting was in 2013. Eli 

Cooper, transportation program 
manager for the City of Ann 
Arbor, will meet with members 
of City Council to provide them 
with updates about the Connec-
tor project for the first time in 
years on Friday.

Hotline Bling invades inboxes

If Drake hasn’t called you 

on your cell phone lately, 
maybe you should check your 
e-mail.

Wednesday evening, many 

University students received 
multiple e-mails from an 
address called “hotlinebling-
blingboi@gmail.com,” each 
e-mail containing a line from 
Drake’s famous song, “Hotline 
Bling”

The messages were sent to 

individual University e-mail 
addresses, not a listserv.

The e-mails were sent over 

a span of a few minutes, with 
students taking to Twitter to 
share their reactions.

The Michigan Daily is cur-

rently running a Twitter poll, 
asking students if they’ve 
received e-mails from the 
source. 

By clicking “show original” 

on a drop down box in the 
individual e-mails, more infor-
mation about the source of the 
messages and the intended 
audience is made clear. The 
source is cited as “Michael’s 
Macbook Pro” and for “LSA 
Sophomore Initiative”

The University does 

not authorize community 
members to assume another 
person’s identity or commu-
nicate via e-mail address with 
another person without truth-
fully introducing themselves, 

according to Standard Practice 
Guide Policies.

“You may not communicate 

or act under the guise, name, 
identification, email address, 
signature, or indicia of another 
person without proper autho-
rization, nor may you com-
municate under the rubric 
of an organization, entity, or 
unit that you do not have the 
authority to represent,” the 
SPG 601.19 guideline states.

Consequences for violating 

the guideline range from disci-
plinary action to dismissal and 
legal action, depending on the 
severity of the offense.

A recent study found that 

companies and the government 
rely too heavily on only having an 
employee compliance program in 
the workplace, and do not depend 
enough on stopping bad employee 
behavior.

David Hess, associate professor 

of business law and the University 
researcher who did the analysis, 
found it is easy for researchers 
to focus on measurable variables 
of behavior, such as the number 
of employee audits done or the 
number of employees who received 
training on workplace behavior. 
Companies often disregard off-
paper, non-quantitative measures 
as these measures of behavior are 
harder to analyze. 

“But to really have an ethical 

infrastructure you need the right 
culture, and that’s not easy to 
measure,” Hess said in a press 
release. “So over time, compliance 
and culture became these two 
separate things when they’re really 
two sides of the same coin.”

Ultimately, Hess suggests 

companies promote an informal 
system supporting the goals of the 
compliance programs set in place 
and assess employee perception of 
the workplace’s ethical climate. 

BrightMatter 
technology to 
improve brain 
surgeries 

New technology developed by 

the University will allow brain 
tumor surgeons to combine two 
types of image viewing during 
surgery. 

The technology, which is 

expected to be in operating 
rooms in July, will be 
incorporated with technologies 
already available in operating 
rooms and combines multiple 
imaging views a neurosurgeon 
would use as they complete a 
surgery. These two views include 
breadth, the view during the 
surgery focusing directly outside 
the surgical field; and depth, 
focusing on fine details within 
the surgical field. 

Used to operate on brain 

tumors, aneurysms and other 
skull- or brain-based medical 
issues, the BrightMatter 
technology will improve the 
brain surgery process. 

University neurosurgeon 

Daniel Orringer said in a press 
release the University is creating 
the “operating room of the 
future” with this technological 
advance. 

BrightMatter has an 

automated arm linked to sensors 
in the surgeon’s tools that 
can provide detailed vision to 
surgeons and allow them to 
know where they are in the brain 
throughout the entire surgery. 
This will inform surgeons what 
critical areas in the brain are to 
be avoided.

undocumented students. 

“If you’re not a resident of 

the state, why should you be 
entitled to resident tuition?” 
Weiser said.

Weiser ran for a seat on 

the board in 2014, when he 
was defeated by Mike Behm 
(D) and Kathy White (D). 
In December 2014, Weiser 
donated $50 million to the 
University, which motivated 
regents to approve renaming 
Dennison 
Building 
to 

Weiser Hall. He has donated 
$95.9 million in total to the 
University. 

This 
year, 
Weiser 
is 

campaigning on a platform of 
conservative values. He has a 
firm background in the state 
Republican Party, serving as 
the chairman of the Michigan 
Republican Party from 2009 
to 2011.

Weiser has contributed to 

the campus and to the national 
and global stage in several 
ways throughout his career. 
From 2001 to 2005, he served 
as President George W. Bush’s 
ambassador to Slovakia. Upon 
his return, Weiser established 
and funded the University’s 
Weiser Center for Emerging 
Democracies, 
emphasizing 

the importance of freedom 
and democracy. 

Weiser previously planned 

to run again for regent in 
2012, 
a 
year 
after 
being 

elected to the Republican 

National 
Committee 
as 

finance chairman. However, 
he said in a press release that 
because he was determined 
to prevent Proposal 2 from 
passing, he devoted his energy 
to the GOP’s national effort to 
challenge the measure instead. 

Proposal 
2, 
a 
proposal 

amendment 
to 
Michigan’s 

constitution 
on 
the 
state 

ballor in 2012, was widely 
favored among state unions, 
but was ultimately voted down 
by 58 percent . The measure 
would have made the right 
to collective bargaining for 
labor unions constitutional, 
reducing restrictions on union 
efforts to negotiate working 
conditions. 
Essentially, 
it 

would have removed legal 
barriers 
to 
join 
unions 

and 
bargain 
collectively. 

In 
the 
process, 
however, 

approximately 170 laws would 
have been invalidated.

Weiser said he believes 

his experience in business 
and government, both locally 
and 
internationally, 
has 

prepared him for a position as 
University regent. He said he 
is proud of being a Wolverine 
and hopes to better serve the 
community.

“We really are a world 

university, and keeping our 
quality of education is really 
important,” Weiser said. “I 
mean it when I say I’m a proud 
alumni.”

No other candidates have 

declared for the two open 
seats. Both will be filled as 
part of the statewide elections 
in November.

“It’s about setting the 

tone,” Dotson said. “We 
want 
to 
give 
people 
a 

different taste of CSG and 
to understand that we are 
here for them. This is Your 
Michigan and we are here 
to help you express your 
opinions and views — you 
should feel protected and 
we want to empower you to 
say how you feel and what 
you want.”

LSA sophomore Patrick 

Mullan-Koufopoulos 
is 

also running with Your 
Michigan, 
and 
is 
doing 

community 
outreach 
for 

the 
party. 
LSA 
senior 

Alyssa Gorenberg is acting 
as the party’s director of 
representatives.

“Everyday I walk around 

this campus and think how 
can we make this better for 
the student body,” Hislop 
said. “What I realized was, 
the 10 of us, of course, can 
see a lot of things that could 
improve, 
but 
there 
are 

42,000 other students on 
this campus and they see a 
lot of different things every 
single day, and we’d love 
those students to reach out 
to us and have their voice be 
a part of our platform.”

While their platform is 

still emerging — candidates 
said they will release a 
fuller list of goals and ideas 
in the next two weeks — 
Your Michigan said they’re 
planning on stressing the 
far-reaching 
backgrounds 

their 
candidates 
have 

through varying leadership 
positions on campus. Their 
core members have acted 
on four different student 
governments 
on 
campus, 

including LSA, CSG, Ford 
School of Public Policy and 
Rackham Graduate School.

They said they think their 

range will help to bring 
better communications and 
interactions 
with 
other 

student governments once 
elected.

“We’ve 
been 
actively 

participating in different 
student 
governments” 

Mullan-Koufopoulos 
said. 

“Which 
really 
makes 
it 

a 
much 
more 
cohesive 

campus and plays into the 
idea of Your Michigan being 
your community and your 
school.”

Another 
strength 
the 

group is citing in their 
campaign is their as of yet 
incomplete platform.

“To 
have 
a 
concrete 

and final platform at this 
point 
would 
be 
unfair,” 

Dotson said. “We’d really 
be overlooking all the other 
voices and opinions that we 
can still hear if we keep our 
ear to the ground.”

Your 
Michigan 

members 
said 
they’re 

seeking 
to 
engage 
with 

clubs 
on 
campus 
while 

campaigning, with the aim 
of establishing connections 
and communications with 
campus organizations that 
carry over into their term if 
elected.

“We 
want 
to 
leave 

behind 
a 
legacy 
where 

the executives are really 
listening to the students,” 
Hislop said. “You have to 
reach out to groups that 
only have 20-25 students 
because they matter, and 
there’s an echo effect there. 
We also want to connect 
with student organizations 
on campus and ask them 
what they need, and what 
CSG can do for them. We 
want to make them feel like 
we are going to be their 
advocates in the long run 
and not just for the month 
of campaigning. We want 
to establish a sense of trust 
moving forward.”

As part of their goals for 

the year, candidates said 
they also plan to reconstruct 
CSG meetings to ensure 
students’ voices are heard 
and the meetings are as 
open and approachable to 
the public as possible. This 
approach, they said, helps 
further the party’s values 
of 
being 
inclusive 
and 

promoting equity.

“Something we’ve talked 

about a lot is that Your 
Michigan is not just the 40 
representatives,” 
Mullan-

Koufopoulos 
said. 
“It’s 

so much more than that. 
We want any student who 
wants to come to CSG to 
come — you can go, you’re 
welcome, you’re more than 
invited. We want people 
who might feel they might 
be ‘othered’ to believe that 
they can make a difference 
on campus...This party was 
created for us.”

CSG elections for the next 

year will be held on March 
23 and 24.

Dishell, the 2014 CSG president, 
and 
current 
CSG 
president 

Cooper Charlton, a LSA senior, 
ran on campaigns featuring safety 
initiatives, increasing diversity and 
fostering cultural awareness across 
campus. In this past year’s election, 
Make Michigan promised to make 
transportation more convenient 
on campus and encourage student-
led participation in initiatives 
pertaining to student life.

Sarkar said though they were 

inspired by previous objectives, 
newMICH will be focusing on 
student outreach in particular in an 
effort to break away from the flaws 
of the previous platforms.

“One thing that I’ve been very 

proud of this group for doing is 
really 
cold-call 
outreach, 
like 

reaching out to student groups 
that aren’t represented in CSG 
and finding out what they want,” 
Sarkar said.

For Schafer, deviations from 

the previous platforms stem from 
student input and what they want 
to see in CSG.

“In terms of the inspirations for 

the platforms, I think a lot of it has 
been in the room and having these 
conversations with administrators 
and students,” Schafer said.

newMICH’s manifesto hinges 

on four pillars: student voice, 
connection, 
well-being 
and 

opportunity. Griggs said the party’s 
goal is to place a student onto the 
Board of Regents, ideally in a voting 
capacity, a feature in multiple 
previous CSG platforms.

Because the makeup of Board 

of Regents is outlined in the state 
Constitution, creating a voting 
position specifically for a student 
would require amending it, which 
requires a statewide vote. As 
well, to get on the state ballot, the 
amendment would either have to 

be approved and collect a minimum 
number of signatures as a citizen-
led initiative, or be referred to the 
ballot by the state legislature.

However, universities in several 

other states with similar laws 
to Michigan have provided for 
student representation on their 
boards through the creation of a de 
facto, non-voting student member.

newMICH candidates said even 

if the student were unable to have 
voting rights, their voice would 
be an invaluable source for the 
assembly.

“It would be important to have 

that non-voting member on (the) 
Board of Regents and various 
committees talking about diversity, 
equity, curriculum,” Griggs said.

Having a presence on the Board 

of Regents would satisfy one of 
the party’s goals, well-being, as a 
student present on the board would 
be capable of voicing support for 
the expansion and funding of 
CAPS and SAPAC programs across 
campus, Griggs added.

The party aims to attain their 

goal of connection by connecting 
students 
with 
the 
Division 

of Public Safety and Security 
through 24-hour chat and texting 
programs. On opportunity, the 
party plans on hosting awareness 
weeks during which CSG helps 
to educate students and remove 
stigma from issues on campus such 
as drug use.

LSA junior Shamaila Ashraf, a 

co-chair for the party, said each 
year candidates pitch plans to make 
CSG more diverse, yet the voice of 
the majority remains the same 
with each regime.

A 2015 Michigan Daily analysis 

found that some groups have been 
notably underrepresented among 
CSG top positions over the past 
22 years in comparison with the 
overall student population, such as 
Hispanic and female students.

Ashraf said she plans to stop the 

continued instigation of old ideas 
by requiring InterGroup Relations 
training, an organization that 
facilitates exercises and training 
regarding identity and inclusion 
for groups on campus, within the 
organization.

“Everyone says that they’re 

going to offer diversity, they’re 
going to offer an inclusive space to 
have those voices, but that doesn’t 
always happen,” Ashraf said.

Griggs 
echoed 
Ashraf’s 

sentiment, saying CSG requires 
diversity moving forward. She 
stressed that newMICH is making 
productivity and inclusivity of the 
student government a priority. 

“In the past, CSG was and 

currently is homogenous. We really 
think that having a representative 
and 
inclusive 
environment 
is 

productive, and contributes to 
a holistic learning experience.” 
Griggs said. “I think that’s what 
separates us from other parties.”

For 
Sarkar, 
addressing 
the 

root problems on campus can be 
accomplished by further distancing 
their platform from predecessors. 
Recent candidates, she said, have 
had 
similar 
platforms, 
which 

she believes has lead to the 
continuation of the same problems 
each year regarding inclusivity.

In terms of transparency, the 

party plans to implement open 
Q&A sessions between CSG and the 
commission, not just between the 
assembly and students. Ashraf, who 
ran her freshman year with Make 
Michigan as a LSA representative, 
said open conversation is just 
one example of how they plan to 
increase transparency.

Overall, the candidates said they 

were looking forward to beginning 
the campaign season. This year’s 
CSG elections will be held on 
March 23 and 24.

“Students are tired of being quiet 

and feeling that the administration 
doesn’t hear them,” Schafer said.

Dearborn campuses will receive 
5.1 and 4.8 increases in funding, 
with a total of $21.8 million and 
$24 million respectively. 

In a press release, Cynthia 

Wilbanks, 
vice 
president 
of 

government relations, said the 
University was pleased with the 
higher allocation.

“This is a great way to start the 

state’s budgeting process and we 
look forward to getting additional 
details 
and 
working 
with 

legislators in the weeks ahead,” 
Wilbanks said. “We have long said 
that investing in higher education 
contributes significantly to the 
state’s economic well-being.”

Under 
Snyder’s 

recommendation, the cap on 
tuition will also be raised, from 
3.2 percent last year to 4.8 percent 
this year. The increased tuition 
cap comes in the wake of several 
higher 
education 
institutions 

breaking it over the past few years. 
None of the University’s tuition 
increases have broken the cap 
since the practice was instituted 
in 2012, with increases ranging 
from almost exactly at the limit to 
a percent or more below. 

Oakland 
University 
and 

Eastern University each surpassed 
the cap last year and had to testify 
to the Michigan House and Senate 
appropriation 
subcommittees 

earlier this year about it. 

Oakland, who increased their 

tuition by 8.48 percent last year, 

received the highest percent 
increase in state funding in 
this year’s budget proposal at 6 
percent.

$107.5 million in the governor’s 

overall budget request was also 
included in the budget to go 
towards financial aid services, 
with an additional $2 million 
was allocated to fund the state’s 
Tuition 
Incentive 
Program, 

which guarantees several years 
of college funding to specific 
populations of students as an 
incentive to complete high school.

Snyder’s 
recommenation 

will now go to the legislature, 
who will have to approve each 
item, a process that typically 
takes months and often results 
in amendments to the initial 
numbers.

Over 
the 
past 
year, 
we 

representatives in Central Student 
Government 
have 
dedicated 

ourselves to serving students. 
The time we’ve spent in office 
has been filled with everything 
from the simple joys of talking 
with students on the Diag about 
their visions for a more inclusive 
university to meeting with faculty 
and administration about our 
school’s mental-health climate. 
In spite of all these positive 
experiences on CSG, we must 
not overlook the criticisms of 
this body, namely that CSG is not 
representative of all students. We 
know this is a truth difficult to 
admit for many, and it is even more 
difficult to change. But we also 
know that complacency with this 
hard truth is unacceptable. It is 
with this inspiration to transform 
student the voice represented in 
CSG that we decided to form a new 
party — newMICH.

Our 
presidential 
and 
vice 

presidential 
candidates, 
David 

Schafer and Micah Griggs, are 
wholeheartedly passionate about 
the work that lies ahead to bring 
forth new representation. CSG 
has long been a body that does not 
represent or serve all identities and 
students, and it’s time for a CSG 
that is representative, inclusive 
and productive. It is our hope that 
students of different backgrounds, 
experiences 
and 
organizational 

involvement will rally under the 
banner of newMICH and work 
together to champion the causes 
of diversity and inclusivity, and 
they will collaborate to expand 
opportunities for all Wolverines. 
We hope to build a newMICH.

However, we believe in more 

than buzzwords. We are running 
on a series of tangible, actionable 
goals and initiatives that we hope to 
prioritize next year. Our focus is on 
connection, opportunity, student 
voice and well-being and safety.

It’s time for a new connection 

between 
students 
and 
their 

representatives. We seek to create 
a leadership scholarship or stipend 
so lower income students can take 
advantage of the many different and 
rewarding extra- and co-curricular 
opportunities that currently exist 
at University of Michigan. We also 
hope to expand CSG support for 
student organizations by way of 
the Wolverine Consulting Group, 
started this year, which provides 
consulting services for student 
organizations. Our goal is also to 
increase the number of available 
study spaces during peak midterm 
and final exam time and to further 
game-day safety by hosting CSG-
sponsored alcohol-free tailgates 
that will have food and hydration 
stations on South State, Hill and 
Packard streets.

It’s 
time 
to 
create 
new 

opportunity 
for 
students. 
To 

make 
CSG 
a 
more 
inclusive, 

representative and educated space, 
newMICH will demand an increase 
in minority enrollment, always an 
issue of the utmost importance on 
campus, and work to improve the 
relationship between the University 
and 
Detroit 
Public 
Schools. 

Additionally, we will work tirelessly 
to make all students feel at home 
by 
establishing 
non-traditional, 

transfer, 
first-generation 
and 

international student mentorship 
programs.

It’s time for CSG to play a big role 

in enhancing the voice of freshmen 
on campus. First-year students 
represent 
25 
percent 
of 
the 

undergraduate student population 
— more than 6,000 students — and 
yet they have no guarantee that 
their voices will be heard by their 
student government. As such, we 
hope to set a few seats aside that 
first-year students can run for 
in the November CSG elections 
each year. Additionally, newMICH 
will institute a CSG-sponsored 

Academic Scholarship Fund so that 
some of the burden of expensive 
textbooks and coursepacks are 
lifted off students.

Lastly, 
newMICH 
will 
fight 

to both further and hold the 
administration 
accountable 
for 

students’ mental health, because 
it’s time for student well-being 
and safety to be front and center. 
Not only do we plan to call for an 
increase in funding for both the 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services and the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center, 
but we also seek to expand those 
invaluable 
resources 
to 
North 

Campus and the residence halls, 
where their presence is currently 
lacking. In addition, newMICH 
will fight to increase the training 
that faculty and staff undergo in 
the areas of mental health and 
diversity. 
Students’ 
relationship 

with 
the 
Division 
of 
Public 

Safety and Security must also be 
addressed and enhanced, and we 
hope to achieve that by creating 
an emergency texting and instant 
message system between students 
and DPSS.

Together, 
by 
addressing 

connection, opportunity, student 
voice and well-being and safety, 
we hope to make your student 
government and the University 
as a whole more inclusive and 
welcoming. It is our belief that, 
at 
the 
University, 
everyone’s 

opportunities 
should 
be 
as 

limitless as their potential. If 
you would like to get involved 
with newMICH to either run as a 
candidate or be part of the “field 
team,” 
please

newmich.

com. Our mass meeting will be on 
Monday, Feb. 15 at 7 p.m. in the 
Weill Hall Room 1110, Gerald Ford 
School of Public Policy. It’s time 
for change, and we’re excited.

David Schafer and Micah 

Griggs are LSA juniors.

DAVID SCHAFER AND MICAH GRIGGS | OP-ED 

From your newMICH candidates

I 

n 2013, the Being Black at the University 
movement, which gained traction through 
the #BBUM Twitter campaign, and the 

University of Michigan’s 
Understanding 
Race 

theme semester — a blend 
of intellectual and cultural 
immersion of coursework, 
lectures, exhibits, musical 
theatre 
performances 

and so on, enjoyed by 
the University and Ann 
Arbor 
community 
at 

large — sparked a wave 
of 
discussions 
about 

diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion 
within 
the 

student population at the University. Notably, 
the comments from these conversations 
brought about a focused committee to 
concentrate resources on creating inclusivity 
within the classroom at the University.

In an e-mail exchange with The Michigan 

Daily, Dr. Marjorie Horton, the assistant dean 
for undergraduate education, who attended 
several events, said she was “personally 
very disturbed and moved by what students 
of color were saying about how race 
impacted their academic 
experiences in and beyond 
the classroom.” In reaction 
to these discussions, 14 
individuals from the LSA 
Undergraduate Education 
division, 
primarily 

directors and senior staff of 
undergraduate programs, 
formed the LSA Climate 
Committee. 
Since 
its 

inception, the committee 
has grown to include five 
subcommittees and has 50 active members, 
including 
nine 
students. 
The 
general 

committee aims to improve campus climate, 
resources and outreach efforts to ensure that 
all students, especially those who belong to 
underrepresented groups, feel welcomed at 
the University.

Horton, Kelly Maxwell, the co-director of 

the Intergroup Relations program, and Dr. 
Dwight Fontenot, associate director of the 
Comprehensive Studies Program, are three 
of 12 members of the Inclusive Pedagogies 
Committee, which creates classroom content, 
curricula and other resources to increase 
students’ and faculty’s understanding of 
social justice and intergroup dynamics. In the 
summer of 2015, the committee filmed a group 
of students simulating classroom modules 
that would help faculty design inclusive 
classrooms that will be published next fall. 
These videos, along with a record of comments 
from previous focus groups, surveys and other 
resources will be compiled into a database for 
faculty to access at any time. 

All committee members I spoke with are 

pleased that the committee has developed 
the videos, and have high hopes for its 
effectiveness and usability in transferring 
pedagogical tactics. However, the committee 
still faces several obstacles.

“The largest challenge is to move from 

theory to practice,” Fontenot said. “We have 
to convince faculty that developing inclusive 
classrooms leads to better scholarship and 
better classrooms. This is a very hard sell, 
especially in the STEM fields.”

STEM fields are not immune to the effects 

of a shortage of diversity. If anything, the 
undisguised gaps in diversity should compel 
STEM professors to ensure that there is 
an environment where all students feel 
comfortable asking questions, participating 
in study groups, and have the tools to 
communicate with diverse identities.

Interactions 
with 
professors 
are 

some of the most intimate that students 
have with the University in general. A 
student’s satisfaction with their academic 
experiences is largely shaped by the classes 
they take and the professors that have 
impacted their course of study.

The University’s mission statement says 

one of its goals is in “developing leaders and 
citizens who will challenge the present and 
enrich the future.” A professor has the crucial 
responsibility of advancing this mission 
statement, promoting critical thinking and 
transmitting knowledge to students. Creating 
inclusive spaces in the classroom is a perfect 
opportunity to do this.

In the process of developing leaders and 

citizens of the world, it is inevitable that 
uncomfortable and difficult conversations 
will transpire, especially if we hope to 
make any meaningful change. In a learning 
environment such as college, it is essential for 
future leaders to know how to navigate these 
conversations collaboratively, with respect 
and dignity. Classroom environments that 
install this framework build the foundations 
for academic and personal enrichment.

“Academic excellence can only happen 

when there are diverse 
voices at every table in 
the classroom space that 
are actually able to be a 
part of these classrooms,” 
Maxwell said. Committees 
like 
the 
Inclusive 

Pedagogies are imperative 
for 
students 
to 
show 

their best selves in the 
classroom, enriching the 
university 
environment 

they occupy.

Classroom 
management 
tactics 
are 

essential 
to 
creating 
inclusive 
spaces, 

but equally as important in transforming 
classroom spaces is the type of material from 
which students learn. A diversity of authors 
and scholarly works need to be integrated 
more frequently and intentionally in course 
syllabi. Academic scholarship from a diverse 
array of authors is imperative in enriching 
a 
diversity 
of 
viewpoints, 
experiences 

and cultures in the classroom. It is also 
encouraging and affirming for students to see 
their identity represented and acknowledged 
as notable work.

From my own classroom experiences, I 

wish some professors knew how to handle 
moments of tension and conflict in a classroom 
— how to encourage thoughtful commentary 
from students without jeopardizing their 
safety or well-being. I have been fortunate to 
have taken classes that have uplifted authors 
and scholars of various races and ethnicities, 
genders, socioeconomic backgrounds and 
sexualities, though I do not know if the same 
could be said for the majority of my peers.

I hope these videos will be widely 

utilized by faculty across departments and 
academic disciplines, and will not act as a 
static repository, but an evolving forum for 
sharing the best practices, which improves 
campus climate from the inside out. The 
Inclusive Pedagogies Committee’s active 
work to address diversity, equity and 
inclusion is an honest, collaborative effort 
to improve campus climate for everyone. 
Fontenot summed up how the University 
community can support the DEI initiative 
perfectly: 
“Having 
faculty, 
staff 
and 

students working together on these issues is 
the only way to build good solutions to the 
problems.”

—University President Mark Schlissel said during Tuesday’s Central Student Govern-

ment meeting.

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

A significant fraction of students make it 

through their four or five years of undergrad 

without really taking advantange of this 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn 

from each other.”

ALEXIS 

FARMER

I

n my last column, I wrote 
about 
the 
odd, 
pervasive 

silence with which we regard 

each 
other 
as 

we 
go 
about 

our days on this 
campus. Burying 
ourselves 
in 

our 
gadgets, 

we seek shelter 
from 
having 

to 
interact, 

from having to 
be 
vulnerable 

with our peers 
and 
colleagues, 

because of how 
tightly 
this 

environment makes us hold onto 
those whom we do consider dear 
friends.

In the time since that article’s 

publication, I have been pondering 
why this is the case, trying to locate 
precisely which aspects and areas 
of University of Michigan life help 
to foster this atmosphere most 
forcefully. It seems to me that the 
way classes and classrooms are 
structured plays an integral role in 
this cold, silent process.

I am talking specifically about 

lecture classes, which, as an LSA 
sophomore, I have found to be the 
most common format to educate 
University students. On a basic 
level, these classes foster little 
interaction between professor and 
student — one is rendered passive: 
a statistic, a filled seat. 

On 
a 
more 
nuanced 
level, 

though, the physical structure 
of classrooms can inform these 
classes’ deleteriously ostracizing 
and 
desocializing 
effects 
on 

individuals, influencing the greater 
campus atmosphere. The seats are 
most often set up so students do not 
face each other; instead, looking 
forward at the only person worth 
seeing — the professor, who will 
proceed to plant information in 
your head — information that you 
are, by virtue of the classroom’s size 
and the bleary, dreary atmosphere, 
discouraged to question or to 
modify. It’s as if you have nothing 
to learn from your peers or from 
yourself, for you are just another 
student, a kowtowing student. 
Instead, look at and learn from this 

polished, handsome professor, for 
she is the only person worthy of 
your attention in this classroom.

These classes, at the beginning of 

the year, most often begin with the 
professor reviewing the syllabus 
with their students — a ritual I have 
always found confusing and oddly 
belittling, as if I am not able to read 
and comprehend such a simple, 
mundane document on my own. 
In highlighting future deadlines 
throughout the term, the professor 
most often will discuss how one 
can go about getting a good grade 
— study for the exams, write a 
relevant paper. Rarely anything 
about participation. What kind of 
a long-lasting, real education can 
actually happen when the student 
remains dormant, seated, silent?

And 
in 
this 
classroom 

environment, 
introduced 
by 

an invitation to be a passive, 
disengaged student, I often find 
myself taking my computer out of 
my backpack, not because I want 
to, but because this is what my 
peers are doing; this seems to be 
the standard method. Inevitably, 
logging in to a computer means 
logging out of the conversation in 
front of me, as distractions of all 
sorts berate me as soon as I lift 
the screen. I know this long before 
I take out my gadget. I feel my 
stomach turning as I do it.

But I am torn because it’s as 

if the structure of these classes 
encourage distracting oneself, only 
prompting me to take notes when 
the professor begins a point with, 
“This will be on your exam … ” 
A student who does this, paying 
attention for just a few minutes 
every class, might very well get an 
A on their transcript. And in this 
world, that grade translates to an 
unmitigated success. Is this how to 
measure the value and effectiveness 
of education?

The attitude of conforming to 

the behavior of my peers represents 
the golden rule in these classrooms, 
where students seldom do the 
things that would make them, for 
a moment, stick out: ask questions 
of their professors, momentarily 
halting 
this 
monotonous 
and 

ineffective process of professor 
talking at student and student 

feigning attention. But it is in these 
moments 
of 
vulnerability 
that 

we learn: about ourselves, about 
each other. It is in these moments 
of asking for clarification that 
professors are actually doing their 
job, which is to teach, not just to 
speak or to present slides to you, 
slides that you could just as well 
watch on your own time.

Is it a coincidence that students 

act 
with 
an 
Armageddon-like 

urgency to get out of the classroom 
at the ends of these classes? Who 
could possibly be stimulated and 
excited by this type of academic 
work? But this reaction, too, is an 
intentional element of the process. 
For stimulation and excitement are 
not, in this context, the goal of these 
classes; the student, instead, ought 
to be obedient and silent, sitting at 
a computer tapping furiously, eyes 
on the end-of-term letter marking 
that will determine the success or 
failure of their time here.

In a social context outside of the 

lecture halls, our eyes similarly rest 
not on the present, not on the scores 
of students who roam around us as 
we walk along the Diag, and all the 
social possibility that lies there — 
no, no, no. Instead, we direct our 
focus only to those circles in which 
we are comfortable, those people 
who represent that end-of-term 
letter-marking — as long as those 
relationships are sturdy, I have not 
failed any social contract.

In both an academic and a social 

context, this is an exceedingly 
irresponsible way to inhabit our 
space. But it is the lifestyle that our 
University breeds and promotes; 
we are not taught to live presently 
— instead of engaging fully with 
our academic work, consider the 
exam, the final grade. Instead of 
striking up a conversation with any 
of the dozen peers sitting around 
you during Michigan time, sink 
into your phone, catch up on your 
friends’ GroupMe.

The silence with which we treat 

each other begins in our lecture 
classrooms, where conformity and 
silence are the rule, and asking a 
question the exception.

Harbaugh, SEC clash over spring 
practice trip to Florida, “whining”

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

No one ever said college 

football was cordial.

With Michigan football coach 

Jim 
Harbaugh 
planning 
his 

second Southern invasion in 
two years, the criticism keeps 
on coming. This time, instead of 
satellite camps, Harbaugh wants 
to take his team to Bradenton, 
Fla., for spring practice over the 
school’s spring break.

“We’re going to work hard, and 

we’re going to have fun doing it,” 
Harbaugh said of the trip after 
his Signing of the Stars event 
last week. “We’ve already got 
some good plans to have swim 
meets. We’re going to have putt-
putt golf. We’re going to have 
football meetings. We’re going to 
have practice. I think it gives us a 
chance to win at a lot of different 
levels.

“Everybody’s 
going 
to 

get spring break. There’s no 
youngster who can’t afford to fly 
somewhere who won’t be able 
to enjoy his spring break. What 
better way to do that than by 
playing football?”

Not mentioned, of course, is 

the fact that the trip would put 
the Wolverines in a recruiting 
hotbed, practicing at talent-rich 
IMG Academy at a time when 
Harbaugh and Michigan are 
perpetually making headlines on 
the recruiting circuit.

The Southeastern Conference 

and 
its 
commissioner, 
Greg 

Sankey, want him to stay home. 
Tuesday, 
CBSSports.com’s 

Dennis Dodd reported that the 
SEC is attempting to prohibit 
schools from holding spring 
practice during spring break.

The motivation behind the 

SEC request, publicly, was out 
of concern for increasing time 

demands of players, in this case 
asking them to give up a week 
that is, by definition, a break.

Harbaugh, naturally, didn’t 

appear to take kindly to that.

Wednesday, 
the 
Michigan 

coach posed a question to his 
Twitter followers that seemed to 
reference the SEC complaints.

“Question of the day: Does 

anyone find whining to be 
attractive? 
Just 
curious,” 

Harbaugh tweeted.

While attractiveness may not 

be what Sankey and co. are going 
for, the message was received 
loud and clear.

The recruiting significance 

of IMG Academy shouldn’t be 
discounted, as the No. 1 prospect 
in 2017, Dylan Moses, is a student 
there, along with six other 
prospects in the top 150 of the 
247Sports composite rankings.

And while neither side has 

highlighted recruiting as a reason 

for their dispute, the coincidence 
is hard to ignore.

In response, Sankey rebuffed 

Harbaugh’s apparent subtweet, 
essentially declining to comment, 
but making his feelings known in 
the process.

“I’m not going to reduce what 

is an important conversation to 
some childhood use of Twitter,” 
Sankey said, via Al.com.

It’s not the first time Harbaugh 

and the SEC have butted heads, as 
some of the conference’s coaches 
took umbrage with his Summer 
Swarm camp tour last summer. 
 

Harbaugh got his way then, and 
with the planned trip scheduled 
for less than three weeks from 
now, he likely will on this issue, 
too.

But this also isn’t likely to 

be the last time the Wolverines 
coach clashes with the SEC. And 
with every passing incident, it 
seems to only grow more tense.

ON THE DAILY

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh has ruffled plenty of feathers with his recruiting tactics in his time in Ann Arbor, including a pair of clashes with the SEC.

Infield combines 
new and old faces

Led by Romero, 
Wolverines boast 
strong group of 
returning players

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

As the No. 2 Michigan softball 

team prepares to open its season 
this weekend, it faces a challenge 
in blending the old with the new. 
While the Wolverines retain 
the majority of their Women’s 
College World Series runner-up 
squad from last year, they must 
overcome the loss of two key 
pieces of their starting infield — 
catcher Lauren Sweet and first 
baseman Tera Blanco.

Though Blanco is still a 

member of the team, she will be 
transitioning to her preferred 
position 
at 
pitcher 
in 
her 

sophomore season, leaving the 
starting spot at first up for grabs. 
Though question marks abound 
in regard to who will claim the 
position, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins faces no shortage of 
options to fill the void.

“Well, you’ve got (sophomore 

infielder) 
Aidan 
Falk 

who 
works 

over 
there,” 

Hutchins 
said. 
“And 

really, 
(freshman 
utility player) 
Faith Canfield 
is 
somebody 

that’s 
very 

valuable. 
She 
is 
the 
most 

prepared to play this level out 
of really anybody on this team, 
and we’ve been looking at her. 
So, I expect execution level to 
determine that.”

Sweet, on the other hand, 

graduated last spring. After 
serving as a security blanket for 
the Wolverines as a four-year 
starter, Michigan faces a tall 
order in replacing her leadership 
and productivity behind the 
plate.

Eager 
to 
find 
her 
heir 

apparent, the Wolverines took 
to the recruiting trail with 
purpose. Scouring the state for 
high-quality talent, Michigan 
found freshmen catchers Alex 
Sobczak and Katie Alexander, 
from Farmington and Ypsilanti, 
respectively.

“There’s a lot to be said for 

being a freshman and being a 
catcher,” Hutchins said. “It’s one 
of the toughest learning curves 
there is. (Sobczak) is ahead of 
where Sweet was at this time (in 
her career), but she’s now going 
to need the game experience to 
get better. I expect there to be 
a learning curve, which means 
maybe some gray hairs for me at 
times ... we have to let her grow.

“And a really pleasant surprise 

has been Katie Alexander, who 
I originally recruited to be a 
bullpen catcher. But she’s much 
better than a bullpen catcher, 
and she’s going to have some 
time for us and give us some 
depth there.”

Despite the transitions at 

first and catcher, the left side 

of the infield remains relatively 
solid for the Wolverines, due in 
large part to the return of All-
American and 2015 inaugural 
espnW Softball Player of the 
Year Sierra Romero, a senior 
second baseman.

Romero 
has 
been 
nearly 

unstoppable 
throughout 
her 

college career, but last season, 
she took her dominance to a 
whole new level. With a .449 
batting 
average, 
22 
home 

runs, 83 RBIs, a .909 slugging 
percentage and an OBP of .601 
on the season, Romero played 
a pivotal role in guiding the 
Wolverines in their journey to 
the WCWS.

Alongside her at third and 

short 
are 
juniors 
Lindsay 

Montemarano 
and 
Abby 

Ramirez, respectively. Ramirez, 
in particular, enjoyed a breakout 
sophomore campaign, providing 
some 
extra 
firepower 
for 

Michigan from the No. 9 spot 
in the lineup with a .371 batting 
average and 24 RBIs.

Together, 
Romero 
and 

Ramirez make a formidable duo 
on defense, combining at second 
and short to great effect. That 
should come as no surprise, 
given that both have experience 

playing 
each 

other’s position 
at a high level. 
Romero played 
at 
short 
and 

Ramirez played 
at second before 
they 
flipped 

positions, 
which 
explains 
their 

harmonious 

relationship on the field.

“Oh, we’re awesome,” Romero 

said. “She knows my range so 
well and I know her range so 
well; we just complement each 
other. And we joke about it all 
the time, that we made some 
really cool plays. We know what 
each other is thinking. It’s nice 
because we both know what 
areas are hard to make plays at. 
When she has a backhand throw 
and good spin on the ball, I know 
where the ball is probably going 
to go. We read each other and 
feed off each other very well.”

The stable presence of veteran 

leadership between the two and 
Montemarano will undoubtedly 
help 
ease 
the 
adjustment 

process at first and catcher. The 
experience of playing together 
for an extended period of time 
strengthens the infield unit 
as a whole despite the roster 
turnover.

“It helps a lot because in this 

sport, communication is key, 
especially when all hell breaks 
loose and the ball is going the 
other way and you need to just 
calm down and talk,” Romero 
said. “I think we do a really 
good job with that, and now 
we’re putting our new freshmen 
in and they’re kind of getting 
the hang of it. Having all those 
returners really helps make the 
whole transition a lot easier.”

The infield will rely on these 

returners to bridge the gap 
between the old and the new, 
and if they do, Michigan can 
expect its recent run of success 
to continue.

“There’s a lot to 
be said for being 
a freshman and 
being a catcher.”

Compher talks top line, 
haircuts from De Jong

Michigan captain 

part of potent 

trio with 

Connor, Motte

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Junior forward JT Compher 

is having his best season yet 
while donning the maize and 
blue.

Michigan’s captain has tallied 

10 goals and 28 assists through 
25 
games, 
shattering 
his 

previous season high in points, 
31.

Since Compher was paired 

with freshman forward Kyle 
Connor and junior forward 
Tyler Motte 14 games ago, he 
has netted nine goals and 18 
helpers. His play both on and off 
the ice has been critical for the 
Wolverines.

And for all of these reasons, 

Compher was selected to be a 
part of this week’s edition of 
Quick Hits.

The Michigan Daily: Your 

line has been coined the “CCM 
line.” Tyler Motte didn’t know 
what that meant at first. Did 
you?

Compher: Yeah. I knew what 

it meant.

TMD: Are you surprised 

that Tyler couldn’t pick that up 
quickly.

Compher: I’m not going to 

comment on that (laughs). I’ll let 
him think about that on his own.

TMD: Do you like the name?
Compher: Yeah. We don’t 

pay attention to it that much. 
It’s something you guys pay 
attention to much more than we 
do. For us, it’s just about playing 
well with each other.

TMD: Have you ever been on 

a line that has been as offensively 
gifted as this one?

Compher: I’ve been fortunate 

to play with some really good 
players, but the chemistry has 

been great this year and the 
production has continued.

TMD: Have you ever made 

Red Berenson laugh?

Compher: A couple times, 

yeah. In some meetings, but we 
will keep that between us, the 
team and him.

TMD: What’s the meanest 

thing you’ve had to do as captain 
this year?

Compher: There’s nothing 

really that has been mean. It’s 
just like being one of the other 
guys.

TMD: Has any part of the job 

been a transition for you?

At this point in the interview, 

sophomore forward Niko Porikos 
tried to interrupt Compher’s 
thought process, but Compher 
yelled at him to get away. 

Compher: I didn’t say I 

wasn’t mean. (laughs). With 
this group of guys, it’s been 
easy.

TMD: How does it feel that 

everyone on this team thinks 

you are the most annoying 
teammate to practice against?

Compher: I think that is my 

goal as a player. Unfortunately, it 
shows up in practice and annoys 
some guys. I have a select few 
guys that I like to annoy and pick 
on a bit in practice.

TMD: Is Max Shuart one of 

those?

Compher: 
Yeah 
(laughs). 

We’re roommates, so it depends 
if we were bickering earlier that 
day or the last night. And if I owe 
him one or not depends on that.

TMD: On road trips, who is 

the person you least want to be 
roommates with?

Compher: I can’t room with 

Shuart. I’m sick of him at that 
point, so if we were put together, 
I’d definitely ask to switch. 

TMD: Would you let Nolan 

De Jong cut your hair?

Compher: I do. Only the 

sides, no clippers. For the rest of 
it, I go to a professional. … Too 
much of a risk there.

‘M’ seeks momentum 
from Wisconsin visit 

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team will look to build 
some momentum this Thursday 
as 
it 
hosts 

Wisconsin 
following 
a 
strong 

conference win 
Sunday.

The 

Wolverines 
defeated 
Illinois, 96-83, 
riding 
on 

big 
scoring 

outings 
from 

sophomore 
guard Katelynn 
Flaherty 
and 

freshman 
center 
Hallie 

Thome. 
The win was Michigan’s fifth 
conference victory of the season, 
and while the Wolverines (5-7 
Big Ten, 13-10 overall) are in the 
bottom half of the Big Ten, any 
win at this stage of the season 
will help to avoid participation 
in a play-in game to start the Big 
Ten Tournament.

Flaherty scored her 1000th 

career point on the way to a 
career-high 36 points, while 
Thome took advantage of the 
Illini’s four-guard lineup to drop 
25 points of her own.

Michigan 
will 
be 
looking 

to continue its successful ball 
distribution in a well-balanced 
attack. 
Junior 
guard 
Siera 

Thompson, who leads the team 
in assists, led the way in that 
category on Sunday with eight 
assists. Senior guard Madison 
Ristovski and freshman guard 
Boogie Brozoski, who logged 
the first start of her career, also 
contributed seven assists each in 
the Illinois game.

The 
competition 
level 

Thursday should be similar to 
Sunday’s. Wisconsin (3-9, 7-15) is 
in a three-way tie for the second 
worst record in the conference, 

just two games ahead of Illinois. 
The Badgers just snapped a 
seven-game losing streak with 
a win over Purdue on Monday.
Wisconsin has also particularly 
struggled on the road this season, 
unable to win a Big Ten game 
away from home this campaign.

“They beat Purdue, and Purdue 

was having a really outstanding 
season,” said Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 
in 
her 

weekly interview with WTKA. 
“Wisconsin is led by a guard who 
averages about 20 points a game, 
they have a really great inside 
presence as well, kind of a one-
two punch, and they’ve been a 
little up and down but they’re 
coming off a really big win and it 
will be a great challenge for us at 
home.”

The Badgers are led in scoring 

by a pair of senior guards, Nicole 
Bauman and Dakota Whyte, who 
average 16.4 and 12.5 points per 
game, respectively. The two also 
average over three assists per 
game each.

The Badgers won last season’s 

only meeting, 63-53, in Madison 
on the back of a stout defensive 
performance. Wisconsin limited 

Michigan to an abysmal 33.9 
percent from the floor while 
shooting 
57.1 
percent 
from 

3-point 
range. 
Leading 
the 

Badgers from beyond the arc was 
Bauman, who went 4-for-7. The 
combination of hot shooting and 
shutdown defense was enough 
to put away the Wolverines, 
and Michigan will have to look 
out for Bauman once again this 
season if it wants a chance. 

On the flip side, Wisconsin, 

which give up an average of 
71.6 points per game, will battle 
with the offensive prowess of 
the Wolverines. Michigan is 
eighth in the country in scoring 
offense, putting up 81.8 points 
per game.

“They probably are one of 

the top teams in the conference 
in terms of defensive field goal 
percentage or points against,” 
Barnes Arico said after Sunday’s 
game. “So that’s going to be 
interesting because we’re going 
from probably one end to the 
(other) end (of the spectrum) and 
we need to make sure we are still 
as efficient on the offensive end, 
even though we are playing a 
different style of team.”

‘M’ holds off Minnesota for win

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

MINNEAPOLIS — One of 

Williams Arena’s many charms 
are the steel girders that obstruct 
views 
in 

the farthest 
reaches 
of 

the 
gym’s 

lower bowl, a relic of the arena’s 
88-year-old design.

For what they witnessed in each 

stage of Michigan’s surprisingly 
competitive 
82-74 
win 
on 

Wednesday, many of those who 
dared enter The Barn to watch the 
Golden Gophers, now 0-12 in Big 
Ten play, had cause at numerous 
points throughout the night to 
crawl into the corners and hide 
behind the stanchions.

The Wolverines began and 

finished with the same ineptitude 
they displayed in recent blowout 
losses to Indiana and Michigan 
State, as junior forward Zak Irvin 
finished a possession devoid of 
motion with a 14-foot airball 
and Michigan picked up an 
uncharacteristic five fouls in the 
game’s first six minutes.

Michigan also devolved into 

ugliness toward the end of the 
game, when they let Minnesota 
whittle their 19-point lead to as 
little as two. But the cushion was 
enough, thanks an impressive run 
of defensive chaos on Minnesota’s 
part earlier in the game that saw 
Michigan’s Derrick Walton Jr. 
put the Wolverines in control, 
dropping 19 points on a whirlwind 
of devastating fakes and step-back 
3-pointers.

The junior guard, who finished 

with a career-high 26 points, 
left 
Minnesota 
forward 
Joey 

King grasping at thin air on a 
buzzer-beating 
3-pointer 
that 

gave Michigan (8-4 Big Ten, 18-7 
overall) a 42-28 halftime lead, 
quieting a sparse crowd that, at the 
time, had little to celebrate besides 
free heat on a frigid Minnesota 
night.

But Michigan lost focus late 

in the game, committing three 

consecutive turnovers to prompt 
a timeout from Michigan coach 
John Beilein that took a more 
positive tone than one might 
expect.

“I was more trying to give them 

confidence, say, ‘We’re going to 
win this game and we’re going to 
execute this play, and we’ve got to 
get a guy in the lane and play ball,’ 
” Beilein said.

The Wolverines fulfilled that 

prophecy, as sophomore guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
came away with the type of “East 
Coast” play Beilein frequently 
exalts, bumping in the paint to 
draw a foul and finishing at the rim 
despite contact.

Abdur-Rahkman 
wasn’t 

whistled for the offensive foul, and 
it wasn’t the only controversial 
non-call he wound up involved in. 
Minutes later, Minnesota coach 
Richard Pitino, on the precipice of 
a win that has evaded him since Big 
Ten play began in late December, 
found himself pleading with the 
referees for a travel call on Abdur-
Rahkman, which would have been 
the fourth disastrous Michigan 

turnover in a short stretch.

Almost inevitably, Pitino’s pleas 

and his team’s late-game charge 
yielded little in the way of a final 
result, as the Wolverines found 
their stroke from long distance and 
managed to avoid utter disaster in 
the form of a loss that might have 
damaged their NCAA Tournament 
chances irreparably.

“Those 
turnovers 
were 

really huge,” Beilein said. “That 
19-(point) lead isn’t going to stay 
there. They’re not gonna quit. 
They’re too quick, and they can 
score points.” 

A team that lives and dies by 

the 3-pointer, the Wolverines 
did exactly what they couldn’t 
last week while the Hoosiers and 
Spartans embarrassed them on 
their home floor. Michigan made 
14 treys on the night, helped in no 
small part by repeated defensive 
lapses that left redshirt sophomore 
guard Duncan Robinson alone 
on the wing on consecutive 
possessions.

“He hasn’t had a lot of looks like 

that,” Beilein said. “When you’re 
in transition, we hope we can get 

that. He’s trying to figure out his 
pockets of what he’s got to do — a 
little harder cut, a little harder run. 
He had some big baskets as well.

“Sometimes — you’ve seen it — 

when he’s too open, those are the 
ones he misses. That was a big 
make.”

Robinson, as he struggled to 

do in both losses, drained both 
attempts and finished 4-for-7 from 
the field. Sophomore guard Aubrey 
Dawkins did his part, too, with a 
run that came midway through 
the first half, just before Walton 
took the game into his own hands.

The 
bursts 
from 
Dawkins 

and Robinson ended up proving 
entirely necessary, as the Golden 
Gophers’ 
unexpected 
scoring 

flurry and Irvin’s failure to find his 
shooting stroke — he finished with 
four points on 1-for-8 shooting 
— turned a problem-solving win 
into a victory that, given the 
week it followed, wasn’t nearly as 
convincing as it needed to be.

“The last two games, you know 

— that wasn’t us,” Walton said. 
“Tonight was all about getting 
back to how we did things.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Walton scores 26 
to power Michigan

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

MINNEAPOLIS 
— 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. was unstoppable. Zak 
Irvin was unstartable.

But as Michigan flirted with 

disaster against a team making its 
12th attempt at a first Big Ten win, 
the ball found itself briefly in Zak 
Irvin’s hands, then in Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman’s, and never 
in Walton’s.

Abdur-Rahkman drew contact, 

made his layup and calmly sank 
the free throw, making the play 
of the night to cap the game of 
Walton’s season.

“I’m equally excited whenever 

somebody makes a play,” Walton 
said.

Nobody 
doubted 
Walton’s 

excitement. But given the night he 
had, in which he scored a career-
high 26 points, collected eight 
rebounds and dished out seven 
assists, it was simply surprising 
that the game-deciding play didn’t 
involve him.

Leading by two points, having 

just seen their 19-point advantage 
blown to pieces, the Wolverines 
needed a bucket to prevent the 
unthinkable — a loss to Minnesota 
(0-12 Big Ten, 6-18 overall).

Walton had shouldered roles of 

facilitator, distributor, scorer and 
even rebounder earlier in the game, 
but said afterward his takeover 
had little to do with Michigan’s 
early-game stagnancy on offense 
or some of his teammates’ shooting 
woes.

“I don’t think it was because the 

guys were missing shots,” Walton 
said. “I was just trying to get the 
offense flowing.”

The offense flowed, to be sure, 

but it flowed entirely through 
Walton, who did well to put a 
rough week behind him. Walton 
shot just 3-for-10 from the field 
in Saturday’s loss to Michigan 
State and in last Tuesday’s loss 

to Indiana, both of which were 
blowouts and both of which were 
on the Wolverines’ home floor.

“Tonight was a fresh start for 

me,” Walton said.

It was no coincidence, according 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
Walton was told in explicit terms 
what he needed to do to help the 
Wolverines over the hump, and he 
went above and beyond. 

“He responded to the games 

and he responded to some strong 
coaching the last couple games, 
too,” Beilein said, referencing a 
late-game play at the rim that 
helped seal the win. “He’s got 
more responsibilities. … He’s got 
to be able to do more and hang in 
there. And that was huge for him. 
All those 3s were nice, (but) I loved 
his finish down the right lane.”

Walton’s performance proved 

all the more important in light 
of Irvin’s struggles. The junior 
forward, who drew attention for 
an impassioned outburst during 
a 
late-game 
timeout 
against 

Michigan 
State 
and 
openly 

questioned his team’s mental 
toughness following both losses, 
shot just 1-for-8 on the night, 
finishing with four points, two 
rebounds and three assists.

Abdur-Rahkman’s 
and-1 
to 

seal the game was an unassisted 
play, but the play ran through 
Irvin, a surefire sign that Beilein’s 
confidence never withered.

“We were just trying to get Zak 

in the paint and find somebody,” 
Beilein noted, saying he thought 
Walton might have been suffering 
from fatigue late in the second half. 
“I felt (Irvin) had the matchup. … 
Zak had had a nice couple rests. I 
felt at that time that I wasn’t going 
to put it in Derrick’s hands, but he 
could play off of Zak.

Lo and behold, Irvin got into 

the paint, and he found somebody.

“I know they were listening,” 

Beilein said, “because they did it 
well.”

Love Beyond

Love Beyond 
the Binary

“What is love?”
It’s more than just the ubiquitous hook of 

the 1993 dance-pop jam by Haddaway. To 
many, love has a plethora of definitions. It 
can represent a deep affection for another 
person, an intense liking toward a piece of 
art or, to put it more broadly, a strong bond 
between two or more people. However, in 
our society, love is often associated with 
sexuality, and the romantic aspect of love 
is frequently complemented with the sex-
ual aspect of love. This upcoming Sunday 
is Valentine’s Day, which is known as the 
national day of celebration of our culture’s 
version of “love.” For decades, V-Day has 
commercialized “love” in advertisements, 
Hallmark greeting cards, presents and even 
film. People are motivated to spend money 
on loved ones, whether it’s on a thoughtful 
box of chocolates or on sexy gifts to spice 
up one’s sex life. And while the holiday can 
be rather heteronormative in nature, it is 

gradually becoming more inclusive toward 
non-heterosexual couples. Nevertheless, it 
seems to underrepresent a largely unrecog-
nized group of people: those who don’t iden-
tify with the sexual or romantic binary.

Let’s talk about sex (and romance), baby
When it comes to love, sexual attraction 

and romantic attraction are often paired 
together, yet they have completely different 
implications. For people with non-binary 
sexual and romantic orientations, the con-
cept of “love” doesn’t necessarily mean 
that sex and romance always go hand-in-
hand. University of Michigan freshman 
Allie Hodge, who identifies as asexual and 
biromantic, believes that love simply means 
being intimate with someone, but “in the 
way where you feel really comfortable with 
talking to them, where you can share your-
self fully and not worry about judgment.”

It may seem unusual that asexuality, 

which defines a person who feels no sexual 

attraction, can coexist with biromanticism, 
which involves romantic attraction toward 
persons of two or more genders. But Hodge 
makes a clear point that romance and sexu-
ality don’t need to be mutually exclusive.

“I don’t feel the desire to have sex,” 

Hodge said. “It’s not something that I find 
appealing, but I can understand people who 
do find it appealing. At the same time, I do 
feel really strong romantic attraction to peo-
ple, as well as platonic.”

Before Hodge discovered her asexuality 

in 10th grade, she identified as demisexu-
al, a sexual orientation in which someone 
feels sexual attraction only to people with 
whom they have an emotional bond, which 
seemed more socially acceptable at the time. 
But once she came out as asexual, Hodge 
received a range of positive, neutral and 
negative responses.

“When I do tell people (about my asexu-

ality), I usually get questions like, ‘Have you 

gotten your hormones checked?’ ” Hodge 
said. “It’s also a common thing where peo-
ple say, ‘Oh, you just haven’t had experience 
yet.’ ”

Regardless, Hodge believes she felt 

accepted and comfortable once she came 
to the University. In addition to receiving 
encouragement from her mother and sister, 
Hodge has found support at the University 
and in the “ace” community — “ace” is the 
abbreviated slang for asexual — particu-
larly in the Asexual Visibility and Educa-
tion Network (AVEN), an online resource 
that strives to create open, honest discus-
sions about asexuality among sexual and 
asexual people alike. She has also partici-
pated in Aromantic and Asexual Aware-
ness Day, which allows people who identify 
as aromantic and/or asexual to share their 
personal experiences with their romantic/
sexual orientations.

Similar to Hodge, University 

graduate 
student 
Kelly* 

also feels a certain stigma 
against 
her 
romantic 
and 

sexual 
orientations. 
Kelly 

identifies as a lesbian in a 
non-sexual open relationship 
with a man. Even though her 
romantic relationship doesn’t 
correlate 
with 
her 
sexual 

orientation, 
sexuality 
still 

plays an important role in her 
expression of love.

“Even if I don’t want to have 

sex with anyone, that doesn’t 
change 
who 
I’m 
attracted 

to,” Kelly said. “My sexual 
orientation isn’t about who 
I sleep with; it’s about who I 
love.”

Kelly, who also works as a My 

Voice panelist at the University 
Spectrum 
Center, 
mentions 

that she entered her current 
relationship with no idea of 
what she wanted or even a 
full understanding of her own 
sexual orientation, but that 
she and her partner are both 
constantly changing as people, 
as well as the nature of their 
relationship.

“Relationships aren’t static,” 

Kelly 
continued. 
“I’m 
not 

interested in sex or many types 
of physical intimacy with my 
partner, but I still love him 
romantically.”

Love 
can 
be 
seen 
as 

multidimensional, 
especially 

in 
differentiating 
between 

sexual 
relationships 
from 

romantic 
ones. 
According 

to Pharmacy student Kevin 
Sparks, who identifies as gay 
and 
gender-fluid 
and 
also 

works as a MyVoicepanelist and 
GPS Mentor at the Spectrum 
Center, romantic and sexual 
relationships 
each 
contain 

distinguishing traits.

“Simply 
put, 
a 
romantic 

relationship has sex within it, 
but a sexual relationship has no 
romance,” Sparks said.

Sparks went on to elaborate 

the romantic relationship, in 
that it “involves a deeper level 
of shared intimacy, even outside 
of the sexual relationship, and 
moves beyond companionship 
and into a shared desire for 
one 
another’s 
bodies 
and 

commitment.”

Love comes in many forms. 

The notion that love comes 
only exclusively in a singular 
combination of sex and romance 
isn’t always necessarily true. 
When 
love 
is 
specifically 

related to sex and romance, it 
doesn’t have to be both sexual 
and romantic; it can be “either/
or.”

Monogamy, 
polyamory, 

living in (somewhat) perfect 
harmony

Monogamy has been the set 

standard of relationships for 
quite a while. But even though 
monogamy 
is 
perceived 
as 

“normal” by societal means, it 
really isn’t. Sure, we have been 
evolutionarily conditioned to 
attract, mate and live with one 
person for the rest of our lives. 
But should that always be the 
case? For people who identify 
as polyamorous — being in love 
or romantically involved with 
more than one person at the 
same time — relationships are 
much more fluid. Hodge talked 
about the beneficial aspects 
of polyamorous relationships, 
since they involve a lot of 
honesty and rely on a lot of 
trust.

“Polyamory is often looked at 

as cheating or being unfaithful,” 
Hodge said. “But it can also be 
super healthy, where all these 
people have this genuine love 
for each other.”

If you’re not convinced, try 

watching the 15-minute video 
made by Elite Daily, titled “A 
Polyamorous Couple’s Guide 
To 
Sleeping 
With 
Multiple 

Partners.” The clip follows 
Brooklyn partners Caleb and 
Tran, who both identify as 
polyamorous. 
They 
describe 

their 
journeys 
of 
having 

both 
sexual 
and 
romantic 

relationships with other people, 
while still retaining their own 
special relationship as “primary 
partners.” 
Throughout 

the video, Caleb and Tran 
emphasize the key elements 
to 
maintaining 
a 
healthy 

polyamorous 
relationship, 

which are openness, honesty 
and 
communication. 
They 

explain how they constantly 
discuss their anxieties about 
jealousy and their developing 
interests in other people to 
one another. And because of 
their relentless candidness, the 
two are able to maintain their 
own loving relationship and 
relationships with others.

It’s easy to just assume 

that 
this 
couple 
is 
using 

polyamory as an excuse to 
avoid commitment. But the 
video shows Caleb and Tran 
weighing in on the costs and 
rewards of polyamory, as well 
as their genuine, unconditional 
love for one another. This 
isn’t to say that monogamy is 
a limiting or bad thing (it can 
also be just as beautiful and 
dynamic). However, polyamory 
paves the way for people who 
don’t fit in the “normal” realm 
of relationships to explore their 
own identity and engage in 
developing strong relationships 
with people, whether platonic, 
sexual or romantic.

Embrace the ace (and other 

non-binary orientations)

So how should our society 

and culture better represent 
people who don’t identify in the 
binary?

While LGBTQ civil rights and 

representation are increasingly 
becoming part of mainstream 
society, 
a 
lack 
of 
media 

representation and education 
still exists for the LGBTQ 
community and especially for 
non-binary communities. Over 
time, sexuality and romance 
have 
become 
prominent 
in 

our media — film, television, 
music, books and specifically 
Valentine’s Day — and a lot of 
those mediums often capture 
sexuality and romance through 
a heteronormative lens.

“A lot of our society is geared 

towards 
sex,” 
Hodge 
said. 

“And even as an asexual, it’s 
sometimes hard for me to say 
that I really don’t want to have 
sex.”

Hodge said that the topic of 

not having sex is not widely 
discussed and that when it is, 
it’s said “in the way that it’s 
shamed, like, ‘Oh, you poor 
virgin.’ ”

Moreover, 
media 
can 
be 

perceived 
as 
generating 

heteronormative 
content 

intentionally 
for 
the 
sake 

of 
maintaining 
the 
normal 

standard of what a “proper” 
sexual 
and 
romantic 

relationship 
should 
be. 

Valentine’s Day, in particular, 
makes 
this 
struggle 
for 

recognition among the non-
binary community extremely 
difficult, 
since 
the 
holiday 

caters toward predominantly 

binary-based relationships. 

Sparks 
believes 
that 
the 

mediums 
and 
commercial 

outlets 
in 
our 
society 

all 
“knowingly 
promote 

themselves through idealistic, 
heteronormative, 
two-person 

relationships 
because 
they 

believe that will provide them 
with 
the 
most 
successful 

outcome 
and 
the 
most 

consumers.”

“It 
is 
not 
a 
lack 
of 

awareness that causes this 
underrepresentation,” 
Sparks 

continued. 
“But 
rather 
a 

choice on behalf of a cisgender, 
heteronormative, 
binary-

seeking person to disengage 
an integral portion of the 
community.”

As someone who doesn’t 

conform to the romantic and 
sexual binary, Kelly also has 
to constantly deal with “the 
assumption that people like 
(me) don’t exist — whether 
that’s because you don’t want to 
be in a relationship, are in more 
than one relationship or in a 
relationship with more than 
one person, are in a nonsexual-
romantic relationship.”

While our society has yet 

to expand its inclusiveness 
toward 
people 
with 
non-

binary sexual and romantic 
orientations, 
education 
can 

be one essential component 
in reaching that goal faster. 
This can pertain to breaking 
down LGBTQ and non-binary 
stereotypes, informing people 
about the variety of terms used 
to describe LGBTQ and non-
binary orientations and general 
inclusion of people who aren’t 
heterosexual, 
heteroromantic 

or 
cisgender. 
Validity 
is 

particularly 
important, 
as 

Hodge points out, because “it 
recognizes that other people 
are different from you.”

Even the queer community, 

Hodge continued, doesn’t know 
much about non-binary terms 
because they’re not widely 
discussed. Sparks said he feels 
a similar way, since for him, 
it’s difficult expressing himself 
to others, as someone “whose 
sexual preferences far exceed 
the ‘vanilla’ standard that is 
societally acceptable.”

What’s love got to do with it?
Relationships, 
whether 

sexual or romantic, are not 
about always being in one fixed 
state. Rather, they are about 
embracing 
multiple 
feelings 

that transcend the binary.

“People aren’t always gonna 

be on this black and white 
scale, but rather be (part of 
the) rainbow spectrum,” Hodge 
said.

It’s true that our society 

is progressing in accepting 
and embracing the LGBTQ 
community with an emphasis 
on love and pride. A national 
milestone was made this past 
summer on the Supreme Court’s 
decision to overturn several 
state laws and statutes banning 
same-sex marriage, including 
Michigan’s, 
legalizing 
it 

nationwide. 
Sunday’s 
Super 

Bowl halftime performance was 
another great example of this as 
well, as a multi-colored crowd 
spelled out “Believe in Love,” 
while Chris Martin of Coldplay, 
Bruno Mars and Beyoncé belted 
out a medley. But what our 
society must continue to strive 
for is acceptance of people 
who don’t associate with the 
traditional idea of love, and 
once we achieve that, then 
love can seen not as black or 
white, but for what it truly is: a 
rainbow.

If you could go back in time 

to see any concert, who would 
you see and why?

“R.E.M. 

1980. In 
Athens, 
Georgia for 
their first 
concert. Also, 
David Garza, 
when he 
planted a big, 
wet kiss on 
my cheek at 
his concert in 
Austin,” said 
author Mo 
Daviau in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily.

Daviau, a graduate of Smith 

College and the University of 
Michigan’s coveted M.F.A. 
program, used this enthralling 
question as the premise for her 
debut book, “Every Anxious 
Wave,” set to release February 
9. He will be giving a reading at 
Literati on Monday, Febuary 15.

Both an icebreaker and 

a cunning plot designed to 
silently judge an individual’s 
music taste, Daviau brought this 
innocent conversation starter to 
life in “Every Anxious Wave.” 
Delving into the conundrum of 
time travel and the love, loss 
and inevitable misadventures 
it brings, Daviau’s debut novel 
documents the life of a burned 
out indie-rock guitarist named 
Karl Bender and the turn his 
mundane life takes when he 
discovers a wormhole in his 
closet.

That’s right, a wormhole. 

A rip in the space-time 
continuum exists in Karl’s 
Chicago apartment, rests above 
his beloved bar, which houses 
alcoholic relief for its regulars 
and rock concerts for those 
willing to pay a hefty price.

“I was having a crappy 

evening of self-pity in 2010 
when I had the idea that if I 
cranked up the song “Sally 
Wants” by the band Henry’s 
Dress loud enough I could break 
the space-time continuum and 
propel myself back to 1995 and 
make entirely different life 
choices,” Daviau said. “This 
obviously didn’t happen, but 
instead I sat down and began 
writing the book.”

This may have been the 

precise moment Daviau began 
writing her premiere work, 

however the idea for it was 
churning in her mind for years 
before she first put pen to paper.

After losing her father at the 

age of sixteen, Daviau always 
dreamed of spending more time 
with him to compensate for the 
lost years of father-daughter 
bonding. Of course this was an 
impossible dream, but in her 
ambitious imagination there 
was one logical way of achieving 
it: time travel.

Although Daviau is unable 

to master the art of time travel 
herself, she is able instead to 
cultivate a landscape in which 
her characters not only master 
it but use it to correct the losses 
with which the universe has 
unfairly burdened them.

What’s most intriguing about 

this novel, however, is not 
the wormhole or side story of 
Karl’s best friend getting stuck 
in Mannahatta in the year 980. 
No, what’s most fascinating is 
Daviau’s remarkable ability to 
weave a love affair starring the 
tough, prickly, determinedly 
independent Lena into a story 
already consumed by the 
inconsistencies of time.

It’s not narrator and 

protagonist Karl that 
dominates the story; it’s his 
love interest, Lena. She is 
dragged into Karl’s life by 
his desperate need for an 
astrophysicist to get Wayne, 
the aforementioned lost-in-
time colleague, back from the 
Stone Age. Lena hurdles into 
Karl’s bar and life with all 
the battle scars of a woman 
who has both endured sexual 
assault and fought her way to 
the top of a male-dominated 
field.

“Lena is an amalgam of 

various women I have known 
as friends and colleagues over 
the years — women who have 
been slightly beaten down by 
life, women who have received 
poor treatment in their careers 
and education in terms of 
sexual assault or abuse or any 
other number of things that 
happen mostly to women that 
affect their ability to succeed,” 
Daviau said.

She’s not just an amalgam; 

she’s an enigma. Lena and 
Karl enter into a relationship 
characterized by a reversal of 
gender roles and punk rock, 
but she refuses to continue to 
bear the burden of her past 
when an easy solution for her 
problems presents itself in the 

form of Karl’s closet. Instead 
of disclosing her past to Karl, 
she takes matters into her own 
hands.

“Girls like Lena are 

underrepresented in 
literature,” Daviau said. 
Modern heroines have 
presented themselves in 
the form of “The Hunger 
Games” ’s Katniss Everdeen 
and “Divergent” ’s Tris. They 
are simultaneously strong, 
unimpeachable, hopelessly 
beautiful and intelligent. 
Their fatal flaws make them 
dynamic, appeal to mass 
audiences and have created a 
specific brand of toughness.

The women Daviau strives to 

convey through Lena are those 
that have been beaten down 
time after time by society but 
still rise up to meet a challenge. 
The character of Lena isn’t 
strong because she has been 
thrown into a dystopian world 
and has to be, she is strong 
because brutal circumstances 
endured in reality have made 
her that way.

Time travel and sexual 

assault aren’t traditionally 
complementing topics broached 
in literature, but Daviau 
skillfully combines them to 
create both a world in which a 
21st century Chicago landlord 
can engage in a heated affair 
with Freddie Mercury, and 
a woman can revisit the 
emotional trauma of a parent’s 
death.

“Life. Life is what gives this 

story balance,” Daviau said, 
for from her perspective, life is 
just as strange and inexplicable 
as the subjects she addresses in 
her book.

And thus, the astrophysicist 

and retired guitarist enter 
into a relationship that spans 
thousands of years and quite 
literally transverses the 
universe, moving from a time 
when language is in its early 
stages of development to the 
apocalypse.

For her debut novel, Daviau 

has certainly made a point 
to stand out. She champions 
feminism and science and 
esoteric indie rock bands over 
the course of 250 pages. “Every 
Anxious Wave” isn’t simply 
a romance. And it isn’t just a 
tribute to strong women. It is 
a science fiction, rock ‘n’ roll 
punk opera with a twist of 
fate written in the stars of 980 
Mannahatta.

Daviau to unleash 
her dystopian world

SINGLE REVIEW

“Avoiding Boys” is a song 

worthy of blowing out your 
speakers. It’s a dance-around-
in-your-
underwear, 
confidence-
demanding 
track. 
ROMP, 
the group 
responsible 
for the tour 
de force, is 
expected 
to release 
its first 
full-length album, Departure 
From Venus, in early March.

The chorus of “Avoiding 

Boys” is undeniably empow-
ering, with thrashing guitar 
backing up a voice telling you 
“I don’t care what you might 
say / This is gonna be a great 

fucking day.” In combina-
tion with this emboldening 
refrain, the song can read 
as a self-help guide for the 
apathetic millennial, toting 
lines such as “Last summer I 
could barely get up / Noting 
was easy.” Lines such as this 
hint at mental illness, a topic 
that is becoming more openly 
discussed, and presents it in 

an approachable, normalizing 
way.

“Avoiding Boys” is mighty 

in soundscape, honest in its 
ideas and a pretty good stand-
in for a good friend telling you 
that everything will be ok. Not 
to mention the title, which 
presents some great advice in 
and of itself.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

By HANNAH SPARKS

Daily Arts Writer

Cut outs, open backs and 

shiny leather are among us in 
the latest Versace collection. The 
first few models to walk the run-
way are dressed in stark white 
outfits that are coupled with 
neon details. The first jacket is 
slightly boxy, structured and has 
straps that look like a mimic of 
neon suspenders. The ever so 
talented rapper, Riff Raff would 
be all over it.

I’m currently reaching for the 

Tylenol because I sense a head-
ache coming on. This first wave 
of neon is nauseating. It does 
come back to us later on. Fortu-
nately it’s mixed in with blue and 
black pieces so it’s much easier 
on the eyes. In fact later on in 
the show a model walks out in 
a long sky blue dress. The top 
of the dress is quite incredible, 
as it looks like it’s made of PVC 
plastic. PVC is the same material 
that is used the make the “Jel-
lies” sandals. It’s strung around 
the models neck, wrapped 
around her arms just below the 
shoulder, cut out around the ribs 
and finally it’s met with the blue 
fabric itself that makes up the 
rest of the dress. The colorful 
PVC runs down the sides of the 

dress, which resembles dripping 
paint. It’s a bold look, one that 
I could see Taylor Swift try-
ing to pull off, but failing in the 
process.

Five minutes into the show 

the most creative mini-dress I’ve 
ever witnessed comes floating 
down the runway. It’s what sexy 
and fun mini-dress dreams are 
made of. It’s the same color blue 
as the Crayola markers I would 
get so hype for when I was 
younger. The dress has some-
what of a blue and white check-
erboard pattern, just enough 
to make you gravitate towards 
whoever wears it. There are 
circular cut out shapes around 
the chest and down the bodice 
that stop just before the hips. 
The same goes for the back of 
the dress. I’m slightly obsessed 
with this piece and am curious 
to know how it would look on 
someone who could actually 
fill it out. *Coughs* me, please 
Donatella send it to me. Whether 
its your taste or not, it undeni-
ably demands attention and has 
my vote for the best dress in the 
collection.

Somehow the next look (the 

worst look) was very unflatter-
ing, even on the 90lb model that 
wore it. It’s a white long dress, 
the left shoulder is held up by 

a fashionable looking seatbelt. 
There is a massive cutout right at 
the hipbone. This makes it look 
like someone put an oversized 
hole in the side of the dress. 
Unfortunately this just makes 
the model look like she has a 
very round side, like her non-
existent fat is popping out.

So I’m all about the whole 

“Free the nipple” campaign, as 
well as ditching my bra, but let 
me tell you these last two looks 
embrace those ideas to the full-
est. There are two dresses one 
short, one long and for both of 
them the chest area is complete-
ly see-through. Made of a very 
thin crystal-like material they 
leave little to the imagination. 
It’s a super sexy look and I can’t 
wait to see which celebrity is 
bold enough to wear one of these 
dresses.

Donatella Versace knows how 

to make a woman look sexy and 
confident. This collection had 
a few questionable pieces but 
other than that it’s clean cut, 
colorful, and fearless. If I had to 
describe it in one word, I would 
say it was “Powerful.” I can’t 
wait until the day I can walk 
around in something labeled 
Versace. Until then I will chan-
nel my inner Versace vibes, no 
matter what I’m wearing.

dreams are made of

How to fall out 
of love in college

A guide to ruining 

your very own 
relationship

By HANNAH SPARKS

Daily Arts Writer

Disclaimer: That was not a 

sarcastic title. This is actually 
the perfect tool guide to ruining 
a relationship. Sorry to everyone 
who was hoping for a cute and 
sappy article right in time for 
V-day, because this is quite the 
opposite.

Unfortunately 
I 
recently 

succeeded in ruining a romantic 
relationship with a really great 
guy. You may be wondering, 
“Why would you do such a thing, 
Hannah?” To that I say, just 
because someone is “perfect” 
doesn’t mean they’re perfect for 
you.

Now I’m going to explain to 

all you lovelies out there how 
you to can ruin a relationship, 
just like I did (yay)!

The first step is obviously to 

meet someone you find genuinely 
interesting. Now, read carefully 
because what I’m about to say is 
a vital part of this process. Make 
sure to connect on a really deep 
level of consciousness. In other 
words, fall in love with their 
brain before their looks. Once 
you’ve done that, the two of you 
will naturally become something 
we all like to call BFFs.

So now you’re in the BFF 

stage. During this time you need 
to: text everyday, hangout at least 
twice a week, get really drunk 
together (without hooking up) 
and meet each other’s families. 
This part is really fun, so enjoy it 
while you can.

This next step is optional, 

but relevant to my personal 
experience. 
Make 
the 

relationship 
an 
LDR 
(long 

distance relationship). When a 
friend transfers to a different 
school than the one you’ve 
attended together, it’ll be sad 
and the both of you will miss 
each other. Now you’ll be asking 
yourself — “Why do I miss them 
so much, is this more than a 
friendship, should I act on these 
feelings?” This is hard and a time 
where you’ll need to dig deep 
into your unconscious mind, to 
find the “right” answer.

After pinpointing how you 

really feel, hang out with them 
when they visit home and have 
a candid discussion about what 
the relationship means to the 
both of you. If it turns out the 
way mine did, you two will 
decide that dating each other is 
the way to go. How exciting!

Your 
new 
boyfriend 
or 

girlfriend will eventually go 
back to school. Don’t worry 
though — calling them everyday 
will take place. Make sure to talk 
for an hour or two, recapping 
each other’s days, and talking 
about mindless things that seem 
much funnier than they actually 
are. Gossip about your friends 

and vent about your problems, 
they will prove to be a great 
sounding board.

The leap from friendship 

to relationship will be easy 
enough, and you will find that 
things are going super well. 
You’re comfortable around this 
person — they lift you up when 
you’re down, they get along with 
your friends and family. Soon 
you’ll find that you both perform 
small (or really big) gestures for 
each other. Things like buying 
gifts for each other (even when 
it’s not a special occasion or 
holiday), surprising one another 
by coming home or going up to 
visit, you could even throw them 
a surprise birthday party (it was 
really fun).

This next part is a good test 

to whether or not you two can 
really stand each other for long 
periods of time. Do what I did (if 

you can find the time and funds) 
take a vacation together over a 
long-weekend. You’re essentially 
living with this person for three 
or four days. Sharing a single 
space for both of your things, 
deciding who gets to shower 
first and what you’d like to do 
on your mini-trip — all things 
that you both have to agree on. If 
you find yourself compromising, 
that’s okay! Compromising with 
your partner is key. Either way 
the memories you’ll make during 
this time will certainly be 
burned into your brain forever. 

So now you’ve been with each 

other for around eight months. 
Of course you’ve hit a few tiny 
road bumps along the way, but 
everything 
was 
solved 
and 

forgotten about with ease.

For some reason the once 

tiny road bumps slowly start to 
get a little bigger. Sometimes 
damaging 
the 
metaphorical 

vehicle you’re both driving in 
together. You try to brush it off 
and ignore the bigger underlying 
problems. This person is just so 
perfect, and you’re the center of 
their universe, so it’ll all be okay 
right? (Wrong)

The holidays come around, 

so naturally everyone is happy 
around this time. A few issues 
arise as to where or with 
which family you’ll spend the 
holidays. Here comes our friend 
compromise again. After you’ve 
both made some compromises, 
you decide to be with both 
families for the holidays. Now 
things seem to smooth out once 
more.

Things are going well, but 

maybe too well? Start to question 

yourself, your relationship, and 
your partner. Agony is what 
you’ll be feeling for a while 
now. Your partner will feel 
anxious; they may even start to 
project their insecurities about 
themselves and the relationship 
onto you. This causes quite a stir, 
but remember you started it.

The holiday break is over and 

it’s time to go back to being in 
an LDR. At this point you have a 
nagging voice in the back of your 
mind that keeps getting louder. 
It’s telling you that you shouldn’t 
be 
questioning 
things, 
you 

should be sure, you’re too young 
to be so serious and finally, 
maybe you should just end it. 
These are scary thoughts, but if 
you want to ruin a relationship 
the right way, you will succumb 
to them.

Tonight is the night, you two 

are together again but you aren’t 
feeling anything except for that 
you might vomit at any minute. 
You made an executive decision 
that the breakup is going to 
happen now, you can’t question 
yourself any longer, its unfair to 
yourself and your partner.

This is the worst because you 

still care deeply for the person 
and you do still love them, but 
you’re no longer “in love” with 
them. Finally you say the words 
and things get emotional, like 
zero to 100 real quick. You beg 
with them to one day have the 
friendship you started out with, 
but you just hurt this person, 
so don’t expect them to agree 
with that. You drive home 
with a feeling like your insides 
are disintegrating, your heart 
physically hurts, your vision is 
blurred by tears and you think 
to yourself we were so close to 
making it to one year.

Now 
it’s 
over, 
you’ve 

successfully ended a relationship. 
You may have even lost someone 
who was once your BFF. You will 
attract all the “feels.” Sadness, 
loneliness, confusion, happiness, 
relief and maybe even regret, but 
let me say this — it gets better.

Although your relationship 

has come to an end, you look back 
at it with such fondness that it 
can only make you smile. Maybe 
here and there you shed a tear 
but you know you’ll be okay. You 
also know your ex will be okay. 
Eventually, one day you will talk 
to this person again. It may take 
time (maybe longer than you’d 
like) but you will come into 
contact again. You may never 
have the friendship that once 
was, but you two at the very 
least, will be friendly with one 
another.

This is life. We will all have 

this happen at some point, but 
if for now you’re “in love” and 
you aren’t questioning things — 
do not follow this advice. Either 
this information will help you 
during your breakup, or this can 
be used as the perfect “what 
not to do” guidelines. That’s all 
of my tips and tricks. Hope this 
helps!

Your above-average 
love-metaphor poem

By NATALIE ZAK

Daily Community Culture Editor

Love is a field of dandelions 

Existing peacefully and 

uncontestedly between two 
amicable countries.

Love is a legume, a life 

choice for a vegetarian,

Sometimes filled with the 

rotting black of seeds 

And sometimes not.

Love is the stuttering amber 

shards struggling to set logs 
aflame.

But there is no oxygen, no 

air, 

And no vocal stylings of the 

great Jordin Sparks.

Love is water, a lake 

speckled with the innards of 
fish 

and the regrets of the 

couples who 

always failed to recycle their 

plastics.

Instead recycling the 

remains of their destroyed 
relationship 

On a two-person trip to 

Sandals

Only to realize the empty 

seat next to them on the 
airplane

Will be filled with nothing 

but self-hatred for the next five 
to ten years.

Love is sanity, the thwart of 

creativity

It brings nothing but the 

stability of marriage

And an infant screaming 

In a gender-neutral yellow 

baby carriage.

Love is a chore, a mindless 

act of repetition,

Never intriguing and never 

thrilling,

Take me now, the lover yells, 

into boredom’s depths.

‘Valentine’s Day’ and 

Cupcakes 

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind do the same activity 

and write about their experiences.

this week’s event:

OK Caro put olive oil in the V-Day cupcakes about .2 seconds after I laughed off the thought. 
She’s sober and fucking this up. We started “Valentine’s Day.” My mom’s favorite song is the 
opener “Say Hey (I Love You)” by Michael Franti & Spearhead. I miss my mom. it’s her bday 

Thursday. hbd mom. I forgot every person was in this movie but it’s slowly coming back to 

me. I definitely saw this on a date during my formative years. Kathy bates just told Jamie 

fox she needs love from him. I’m not paraphrasing, I swear. this movie is absurd. OK 

let’s be honest, flowers don’t even smell good, right? How the fuck did Gary 

Marshall, the man behind “Pretty Woman” go for this shit. I’m pretty 

sure Patrick Dempsey plays a doctor in the movie and also cheats 

on his wife. (LIFE IMITATES ART @ShondaRhimes). 
#unpopularopinion: Derek Shepard was kind of a tool.

if it wasn’t for the ganja and mood elevators 

this movie would have me in tears. topher 

grace looks like he kisses like a 

dead fish. no wonder Donna 
is playing for the other team 

on OITNB. it happened again. it’s 

#confirmed. if Anne Hathaway had a 

real-life phone sex company, what do you 

think her pricing and wait time would look like? 

email arts@michigandaily.com with estimates. Taylor 
swift’s cameo in this movie is by far the least feminist 

thing she’s ever done lols. flight attendants are assholes in rom 

coms. they’re also assholes in real life. these cupcakes need to be 

done. Ashton kutcher is #fiftyshadesofpink in this movie.

if the universe was mine to rule, everyone wearing a fedora would be 

executed. the child buying flowers for his teacher would be done for. the cupcakes 

look better than expected. Valentine’s Day is so great if you’re single and know how to 

have a good time TBH. Eric Dane aka mcsteamy has always looked like a grandpa from the 

neck up. if this movie was even semi close to how humans actually interact my life would be 

hell. this movie’s savior is Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts is actually the world’s savior, I believe. 

poor ideas: telling everyone when you’re gonna lose your virginity. because it probably won’t be 
very good, and then you’ll have to lie about it. so then you’ll be a slut and a liar. who calls a penis 

a who who? I would love to be queen latifa’s personal assistant.

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

Valentine’s Day is cool I guess but I can think of 364 other 

days of the year I’d rather experience/drown in self-

loating/self-pity/chocolate that I bought myself for 

myself. It’s 10:30 and I managed to fuck up the 

cupcake baking process all while staying sober. 

In my defense, @baked, it’s a common mishap 
to mistake coconut oil for olive oil. But in 
your defense, @baked, you tried to help and 
I didn’t let you … oops I’m the worst. Buzzed 
is drinking crystal palace for the first time 
since welcome week … I hope she has a safe 
crossing over to the other side. Ah yes, here 
we go, “Valentine’s Day,” the show we’ve all 
been waiting for. Suddenly we’re all groovin’ 

to Stevie Wonder. I don’t hate this. OK lmao 

George Lopez! It’s George Lopez and a book! GL 

book club? Sign me up! OMG Jamie Foxx and Cathy 

Bates! Everybody is in this movie and I bet they hate 

themselves as much as I hate myself on this holiday.

Naturally, 
I stopped paying attention to this cinematic trash, but was reeled 

back in by the phrase “Neurotic hot mess,” which sounds like something multiple people have 
called me before. Suddenly it’s Anne Hathaway and the guy from “That ’70s Show.” I just heard 
another line I hate: “she thought you were gay and I set her straight” … wow I bet you were the 
star student of your intro to screenwriting discussion. OK well the entire Princess Diaries cast 
was in this. It’s 11 and I’m done with this movie. This Princess Diaries conspiracy drained me.

—CAROLINE FILIPS, SENIOR ARTS EDITOR

I’m only two shots and 30 seconds in and “Valentine’s 

Day” is pissing me off. First of all, the introduction song 
“Say Hey I love you” by Michael Franti makes me feel like 
I want to be on a beach and it’s currently 20 degrees out. 
Thanks, I feel like shit right now because I’ll probably 
never have enough money to live somewhere that’s warm 
all of time.

George Lopez just made an appearance wtf. It’s time 

for the third shot. OK, now here is Jennifer Garner trying 
to be relatable and talk about how she was ugly in high 
school and how Valentine’s Day is so hard for a single 
women. 1) Have you fucking seen Jennifer Garner? I’m 
sorry Jennifer, I don’t think you don’t understand what it’s 
like to be an ugly person and unloved, OK? 2) I forgot the 
second point.

Update: Anne Hathaway just sex talked on her phone. I 

watched this movie once before when I went on a middle 
school date. I hate myself.

I’m probably six shots deep and Emma Roberts just told 

her gym teacher she was losing her virginity and expressed 
that she wasn’t eating lunch before she has sex. Does she 
understand how tiring having sex is? I’d probably eat four 
lunches before I had a planned sexual encounter. “Feels 
like the first time” is playing when Emma Roberts is about 
to lose her virginity. What?

I zoned out, but George Lopez just spit some fire by 

saying some people don’t think love exists unless it’s 
acknowledged by other people. That shit was saganaki 
(you know, the flaming cheese. The “Opa!” moment of your 

meal.)

I can’t watch this anymore. It’s making me think love will always work out and it’s creating 

shallow opinions in my brain, so I’m going to be finished with my bitter drunk antics. If you 
need me I’ll be waiting on my best friend to confess his undying love for me.

Remembering my 
beloved maestro

By DAYTON HARE

A month ago I wrote an 

obituary of sorts for Pierre 
Boulez. Now I find myself 
embarking on a similar task, 
but this time it’s of a far more 
personal nature. Boulez wasn’t 
really a part of my life — Leslie 
Bassett was.

Leslie Bassett wasn’t nearly as 

famous as Boulez; consequently, 
his death hasn’t affected the 
musical community with the 
same feeling of enormity as did 
the Frenchman’s. But within the 
community of the University 
of Michigan, its reverberations 
shook more than a few people.

When Boulez died I felt sad 

in a disconnected, abstract 
sort of way. When I heard of 
Bassett’s death I felt an actual 
poignant pang of grief, the sort of 
unpleasant twinge that seems to 
almost physically shoot through 
the body and land right in the 
stomach. He was the very first 
person to receive a DMA in 
Composition from the University, 
and — following a Fulbright 
Fellowship and a few years 
studying at École Normale de 
Musique de Paris and privately 
with the legendary Nadia 
Boulanger — he began teaching 
at the University in 1952. He 
remained in that capacity for 
nearly four decades, during 
which time he received the 
Pulitzer Prize and a Guggenheim 
Fellowship.

I have heard it said in the 

past that Leslie Bassett built 
the Department of Music 
Composition at the University 
up from nothing into one of 
the leading departments in the 
country — and certainly his 
influence is still profoundly felt. 
My own composition teacher 
studied with him when he was 
a student, and whenever he 
speaks of Bassett I see profound 
admiration glimmering in his 
eyes.

Bassett died on Thursday, but I 

didn’t learn about it until Friday. 
During Composition Seminar — a 
class in which all of the students 
of composition come together 
to have discussions and share 
music — my teacher rose to say 
a few words about the man that 
had once been his own teacher. 
I must paraphrase a small bit — 
and inelegantly at that — as I’m 
working from memory, but as he 
spoke my teacher seemed to have 
a certain amount of heaviness 
weighing upon him.

“Yesterday one of our 

predecessors passed away … 
Leslie Bassett was a wonderful 
musician, but more importantly 
he was a wonderful human 
being. He was kind and caring 

always, even as he struggled 
through the hardships of his own 
life,” he said.

In my composition lessons 

Leslie Bassett is always present. 
Hardly two weeks go by without 
my teacher passing along some 
piece of advice — either musical 
or general in nature — from his 
former teacher. Bassett’s words 
even serve as a reliable answer to 
small musical questions. When 
discussing whether or not a 
period should be placed after an 
abbreviation of a musical term 
in a score, my teacher remarked 
“let’s see what Leslie Bassett says 
…” as he moved to look through 
a Bassett score on the bookshelf. 
(Bassett agreed with me; a 
period should be placed after an 
abbreviation.)

I am connected to Leslie 

Bassett because of my musical 
lineage and because of the 
university I attend — but I am 
also connected to him far more 
personally. In one of the curious 
little ironies in which life loves 
to dabble, Leslie Bassett retired 
in the town where I lived. Not in 
some thriving metropolis with a 
robust cultural heartbeat — but 
a small town in rural Georgia 
whose cultural EKG has more 
or less flatlined. I could easily 
imagine that Bassett was the 
only composer within a 50 mile 
radius.

I didn’t really know him — 

he was one of those people in 
my peripheral, a figure on the 
fringes of my life — but I met 
him a few times. When I was 
much younger, first realizing 
that I maybe wanted to become 
a composer, he offered gentle 
encouragement to me. Whenever 
I would run into him, at some 
concert or other event, he would 
simply say to me “keep writing.”

Around my freshman year 

of high school I started taking 
cello lessons with a wonderful 
woman named Wendy Baker. 
Her middle name was Bassett, 
and as I’m sure you can deduce, 
she is Leslie’s daughter. She 
was patient and kind, with a 
gentle sense of humor, and I 
appreciated her unfathomable 
ability to tolerate the hideous 
cacophony I produced with my 
beginner’s bow and cello in hand. 
I didn’t stick with cello very long, 
because I simply didn’t have 
the time to give it the attention 
it deserved, but I stayed long 
enough to develop a friendship 
with Wendy and passively learn 
about her father.

When Leslie Bassett was just a 

couple years older than I am now, 
he went to war. As part of the 
13th Armored Division during 
the Second World War, Bassett 
fought against Hitler’s Germany 
in the last years of the bloody 

conflict. As Wendy recounted to 
me, somewhere in Southwestern 
Germany the 13th rolled up into 
an abandoned town, from which 
the Wehrmacht had retreated 
in some haste. Passing through 
the empty buildings, the young 
Bassett stumbled upon a band 
room — instruments were 
broken and strewn haphazardly 
around the room, deemed too 
unimportant to carry along with 
the fleeing army.

Somewhere in this musical 

wreckage Bassett noticed the 
mahogany colored body of a 
beautiful cello. Battered and 
more than a little worse for 
wear — the neck of the cello was 
completely broken — Bassett fell 
in love with it. He constructed 
a box out of miscellaneous 
materials he found around the 
town, and with tender care and 
delicacy he packed the cello 
inside and shipped it back to the 
states.

Many years later — after the 

cello’s origin in c.1848 Barcelona 
was known — the instrument 
found a new owner. When his 
daughter Wendy surpassed his 
own abilities on the cello, Bassett 
passed it to her, and she still plays 
it today.

This is not the first time I’ve 

written about that cello — in 
my junior year of high school 
I reflected upon a funeral I 
attended of a fellow cello student, 
at which Wendy played that 
instrument — but this time I have 
a very different point. Perhaps 
it’s just me indulging in a bit of 
hyper-sentimentality, but from 
what I know of what sort of 
person Bassett was, the anecdote 
about the cello is an apt metaphor 
for the way he approached life. 
Leslie Bassett focused on the 
good things among the bad and 
approached everything in life 
with care and compassion.

And so that brings me back to 

the advice I received from him, 
the simple direction to “keep 
writing.” He had never heard 
my music and he really didn’t 
know anything about me, but it 
didn’t matter. He just seemed 
to genuinely want everyone to 
succeed at what they loved. I 
won’t pretend that Leslie Bassett 
is the reason I’m a composer, 
because that likely would have 
happened anyway, but what 
Leslie Bassett did do is provide a 
small bit of hope for a young boy 
who felt frustrated and trapped 
— artistically, intellectually, 
socially — by his surroundings.

He gave me one more reason to 

keep moving forward, one more 
dream to keep alive — and in the 
small, strangely interconnected 
way that the world is, I realize 
now that in a certain way he gave 
me my future. 

COMMUNITY CULTURE

By MERIN MCDIVITT

For the Daily

Late one afternoon at Univer-

sity Flower Shop, a man stepped 
in from the cold air of Nickels 
Arcade. He stood a bit awkwardly 
at the counter, glasses all fogged 
up, until owner Danielle Vignos 
looked up and smiled. “Do you 
know what you’re looking for?”

“Yeah,” he answered. “Can you 

get, um, lilies? They’re a special 
kind of lilies … ” He fumbled and 
checked his phone for the name. 
“Stargazer lilies.”

After placing his order, the 

man, glasses now clear, explained 
his strangely specific request. He 
had asked his girlfriend what her 
favorite flower was. Her answer? 
You guessed it: stargazer lily. He 
told her, “I’m gonna get you that 
for Valentine’s Day.” She said, 
“OK.”

Ladies and gentlemen, a love 

story for the ages.

All kinds of people, and the 

romances that follow them, 
make their way into this small 
storefront with its cheerful 
window displays and warm 
atmosphere. After all, that is the 
nature of a flower shop. Working 
here is about more than artistic 
arrangements and begonia ship-
ments. People send flowers as an 
expression of love in all its forms, 
whether it’s the first kiss or final 
goodbye, regretful apology or 
blossoming friendship.

When everything from 

accounting to relationship advice 
is part of your job description, 
making everything run smoothly 
is no easy task. In little over a 
year, University Flower Shop has 
transformed from a quaint but 
struggling business into a fresh, 
welcoming space full of youthful 
potential. The woman responsible 
for this remarkable turnaround 
is 22-year-old Vignos, a recent 
University of Michigan graduate 
and newly minted small business 
owner. Vignos is also a former 
Michigan Daily columnist.

Walking into the shop on a 

freezing January day feels like a 
long exhale. Summer air rushes 
out for a moment as the door, 
emblazoned with University 
Flower Shop, est. 1959, swings 
open. Vignos, always busy 
arranging bouquets and tending 
shop, greets customers warmly as 
quiet music plays from the shop’s 
tiny loft balcony overlooking 
the arcade. Every surface of the 
cozy space is covered with living 
things — mauve, violet, green and 
colors that don’t even have names 
— a welcome contrast to gray 
downtown that many customers 
appreciate. A student with cheer-
ful clothing to combat the Feb-
ruary chill, stopped by for that 
very reason. “I just think flow-
ers brighten up your day,” she 
explained. A chalk sign by the 
counter seems to agree, sharing 
a handwritten Emerson quote: 
“Earth laughs in flowers.”

With its old-fashioned air and 

cozy interior, sometimes it seems 
as though the shop sprung into 
existence fully formed. But like 
the flowers it carries, the process 
was slow and challenging, and 
Vignos continues to transform 
the space.

“Everything is kind of 

growing together slowly,” she 
explained.

The seeds of the business, 

however, were planted a long 
time ago. Vignos has loved flow-
ers and plants for as long as she 
can remember.

“My dad had a big garden 

growing up; he had a bunch of 

roses,” she said. “I had a little 
garden outside my bedroom 
called ‘Dani’s Garden.’ I remem-
ber in the summertime we’d 
always do our potting and repot-
ting, we’d go to the nursery, and 
my brother and I would get to 
pick out all the flowers and decide 
what we were going to plant that 
season. ”

When Michigan winter came 

around, she sought solace in her 
local flower shops. 

“Something about it made feel 

so at peace and at ease,” Vignos 
remembered.

Flash forward to her gradua-

tion from the University. When 
she heard through the grapevine 
that a local florist was going on 
the market, she jumped at the 
opportunity to bring her child-
hood love of flowers and her adult 
business interests together.

“I had a kid dream about 

owning a flower shop, and I was 
interested in small business and 
entrepreneurship, more into 
brick and mortar spaces,” she 
explained. 

In a time when more and more 

interactions from shopping to 
dating take place online, Vignos 
began to understand what an 
important role physical spaces 
play in town.

“I love community spaces,” 

she said. “Small businesses in 
general are just awesome, how a 
space can inform how you feel or 
what you’re thinking about, what 
you’re doing.”

After spending time getting to 

know the old shop and its owner, 
they reached a deal, and the shop 
was hers. Then the real work 
began. The shop was in need of a 
serious overhaul, something Vig-
nos and her dedicated employees 
are still engaged in.

First order of business?
“Bettering our reputation, 

because this place has gone in 
and out of good times and bad 
times. So I just wanted to bring 
back our friendly nature and our 
history a little bit. We’ve been 
here forever, and so I feel like it’s 
a place that … ” Vignos paused. 
“It can’t leave, you know?” 

This meant transforming 

the inventory and renovating 
the space, making it more open 
and appealing to current tastes. 
Even in a brick-and-mortar 
environment, Vignos knew she 
had to get the 60-year-old shop 
up to speed, including establish-
ing a presence on social media.

“I had to get to know this 

space a little bit better, and fig-
ure out what was not function-
ing well in order to figure out 
what I wanted to change,” she 
said. “And I’m still very much in 
the process of doing that.”

No one, Vignos included, 

anticipated just how much work 
she and her employees need to 
pour into the shop every day. She 
said she has a new appreciation 
for the daily trials of small busi-
ness owners, who form a sup-
portive community in Ann Arbor 
to which she feels privileged to 
belong.

“I see it as so much more than 

a business, so maybe that’s how 
everyone sees it,” she said. “Peo-
ple just seem to put so much time 
and energy and extra 110 percent 
in all the time.”

But while the sheer amount of 

elbow grease the shop requires 
has been a reality check, the 
personal, touching surprises 
that come with owning a flower 
shop are a constant source of joy. 
Vignos said she’s amazed at the 
breathtaking variety and unique-
ness of her wares.

“You think you know a lot 

about flowers and plants, and 
then every day it has just been 
turned upside down,” she said.

The personal connections with 

employees, who are as passionate 
about the shop as Vignos is, have 
made her experience even more 
rewarding.

“It does mean a lot that I know 

the people who are helping make 
this place are having a good time,” 
Vignos said.

During our brief visit, Val-

entine’s Day was in the air, for 
customers and employees alike. A 
delivery person told Vignos about 
her Valentine’s plans to visit her 
daughter: “Give her a visit, make 
her some dinner, tell her I love her 
and that’s enough.”

And then, there are the 

romances, new and old, that sit at 
the heart of the shop. When cus-
tomers come in, they’re looking 
for something beautiful, some-
thing tangible, that will express 
a feeling they can’t explain in 
words. Vignos’s bouquets are sent 
to people in every sort of relation-
ship, from “just friends” to “just 
married.”

“It’s a riot; I love it,” Vignos 

said. “I see a lot of people evolving 
through their relationships.”

Some come into the shop for 

a single rose to ask someone out. 
Months later, they come in for a 
full bouquet, sharing that now 
they’re happily dating the recipi-
ent of that first lonely flower.

Other times, the shop’s storied 

legacy means that Vignos encoun-
ters love stories older than her.

“It’s definitely a place with a 

history,” she explained. “I’ll 
have people come back who 
had their wedding flowers done 
here like 40 years ago.”

Things have changed, 

though, since the shop first 
opened in 1959. This Valentine’s 
Day, the boy-sends-girl-flowers 
trope continues as always, but 
other types of relationships, 
whether it’s a same-sex couple 
or a girl sending flowers to her 
boyfriend, have become com-
mon as well.

“We get a lot of couples com-

ing in — boys and girls, and 
boyfriends of girlfriends, and 
girlfriends of girlfriends, (and) 
friends,” she said. “And they 
always — well, not always — but 
they’ll come and tell me how it 
went because I’m nosy and I ask 
what the occasion is.”

While we talked, a couple 

stood in front of the display 
case, staring and pointing and 
discussing in whispers for a 
good 10 minutes. Eventually, 
they order a bouquet of roses, 
“orangey-red” ones, to be exact, 
to receive this Valentine’s 
weekend.

“We decided to do our Val-

entine’s shopping together this 
year,” the woman explained. 
His idea. “So we’re getting roses 
together, and buying chocolates 
together.”

Vignos smiled and wrote 

down their order, her old-fash-
ioned notepad at odds with the 
iPad where customers sign their 
names. The couple strolled out 
into the cold, though they’ll be 
back in a few days for their roses. 
The shop was quiet again for a 
minute, the only sounds the rus-
tle of the plants and the broom 
on the tile floor.

“It’s always really satisfying 

and nice to hear people’s stories 
about why they’re getting people 
flowers. Sometimes it feels like a 
bartending job, people just come 
clean,” she said. “It’s rewarding 
every day, truly.”

EPISODE REVIEW

 Next to a certain glove 

that didn’t fit, perhaps the 
most iconic moment of the O.J. 
Simpson 
trial was the 
infamous 
White Bronco 
chase that 
unfolded 
on June 17, 
1994. Intense 
and almost 
inherently 
cinematic, the 
event became 
a nationwide 
fascination 
as people 
(95 million, 
in fact) crowded around their 
televisions to watch the highway 
pursuit.

It’s no surprise, then, that 

“American Crime Story” 
devoted its entire second 
episode to depicting this event, 
capturing the frantic efforts on 
both sides of Simpson’s (Cuba 
Gooding Jr., “Jerry Maguire”) 
case alongside the almost 
perverse, yet unsurprising 
obsession of the general public.

Everyone scrambles to pick 

up the pieces in the episode. 

Robert Shapiro (John Travolta, 
“Pulp Fiction”) tries to salvage 
his reputation; the LAPD tries 
not to create an even bigger 
fiasco and Robert Kardashian 
(David Schwimmer, “Friends”) 
tries desperately to make sure 
his friend makes it out of the 
situation alive. Everyone outside 
of Kardashian is in damage 
control as Simpson himself 
fades to the background, not 
appearing on screen until 
more than 10 minutes into the 
episode.

While director Ryan Murphy 

(“The Normal Heart”) is able 
to capture the tension of the 

chase throughout the episode, 
Simpson’s surrender being a 
particular standout; the episode 
most excels when it turns 
its camera on the public and 
how they decipher the event. 
Foreshadowing the divisive 
nature of the trial, people 
interpret the pursuit through 
the lens of their own experience, 
the most profound being race.

Meanwhile, twisted 

captivation glues people’s eyes to 
the screen like a sporting event. 
It may be warped pleasure, but 
the audience isn’t exempt from 
the same urges, as we realize 
the fascination that drew people

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 As my fellow writer 

Christian Kennedy so deftly 
pointed out, Queen has returned 
— and she’s 
edgier than 
ever.

Beyoncé 

dropped 
her latest 
opus and 
accompany-
ing video, 
“Formation,” about an hour ago, 
and I’m probably on my seventh 
listen already. The whole she-
bang is completely off the wall 
— lyrical shout outs are given to 
Red Lobster, Givenchy dresses 
and the hot sauce in Bey’s purse. 
Weird, bouncy synths permeate 

the tune — if you could even call 
it that — while Beyoncé spits her 
quirky affirmations in that slop-
py-sexy-whisper-command of 
hers. At its core, using the most 
virginal interpretation, the song 
is an origin story: B is paying 
homage to her roots: her “daddy 
and mama,” the South and her 
signature diva outlook. 

The video is Louisiana 

bayou, NOLA goodness at its 
raunchiest — a fabulous collision 
of plantation life and thigh-
exposing, burgundy couture 
onesies. Blue Ivy serves up 
some hand-on-the-hip realness; 
Beyoncé thrashes atop a sinking 
vehicle. And spliced into all that 
are various high-octane dance 

numbers with the Queen and 
#squad.

“OK ladies, now let’s get in 

formation,” she sings. She’s 
beckoning those that eat out 
of the palm of her hand (me, 
admittedly, and pretty much all 
of Daily Arts) to pull it together, 
become their own Sasha Fierce’s 
and werk.

“Formation” is both an ode to 

where Beyoncé came fro m — 
where she formed — and a call to 
order. She’s telling us to prepare 
for the most creatively unruly 
version of herself she’s presented 
to her fans thus far. She’s letting 
us know she’s here. And she 
slaaaaays.
