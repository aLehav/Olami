While 
the 
population 

in Detroit has fallen over 
recent decades, the Muslim 
community in the Detroit 
area has grown, in part due to 
the influx of refugees. Sally 
Howell, director of the Center 
for Arab American studies and 
associate professor of history 
at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn, spoke on the long, 
rooted 
history 
of 
Muslim 

communities in Detroit at her 
lecture Monday evening.

“I noticed in 2010 that if 

you look at the census maps 
of Detroit, Detroit as most 
of you probably realize, is 
losing population, bleeding 
population for quite some 
time now” she said. “The only 
zip codes or census tracts that 
showed 
population 
growth 

between 2000 and 2010 were 
also zip codes or census tracts 
where Muslims are living.”

The number of people of 

Yemeni, Syrian, Iraqi and 
Lebanese, backgrounds have 
been 
growing 
in 
Detroit 

since 
about 
2000. 
The 

After 
years 
of 
struggle, 

Detroit’s housing market is 
on the rebound — and young 
professionals may be the cause.

Following a three-year-long 

fall of Detroit’s housing market, 
neighborhoods such as Midtown 
and Downtown are now seeing 
growth in property values.

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, Detroit homes sold for 
the cheapest they ever have in 
2009 — the median listed price 
of a home was $7,000 with many 
houses going for as low as $1 
because of liability of ownership. 

However, the median price 
just hit an eight-year high of 
$165,000 in May of this year.

Several 
factors 
could 
be 

contributing to this growth. 
Some experts say this new 
trend can be attributed to a low 
supply of habitable houses, not 
neccessarily a resurgence of the 
city. Kim Page, a Detroit real 
estate expert, said the number of 
inhabitable houses in Detroit has 
dropped, increasing the value of 
houses that are still inhabitable.

“There 
are 
a 
lot 
more 

buyers moving into the city of 
Detroit, especially within the 
Downtown and Midtown area, 
causing prices to increase maybe 

Fertility and gender equality 

in Japan are both low — on 
Monday, 
leading 
Japanese 

sociologist 
Setsuya 
Fukuda 

asked an audience of about 30 
people on campus why.

From a policy standpoint, 

parental leave, family policy 
and employment opportunity 
laws in Japan are surprisingly 
comparable to that of nations 
in the European Union and 
the 
United 
States, 
Fukuda 

said. However, but Japan’s 
population is shrinking due to 
aging and low birthrates, and 
social roles may be to blame.

Fukuda 
is 
a 
senior 

researcher in the Department 
of Planning and Coordination 
at Japan’s National Institute of 
Population and Social Security 
Research. His lecture focused 
on issues women face in the 
workforce, 
and 
subsequent 

impacts on birth rates, Japan 
has 
3.45 
million 
potential 

female workers, and Fukuda 
cited several to social pressures 
that may disincentivize women 
from working.

“I personally believe that 

gender issues or reconstructing 
gender 
roles 
in 
Japan 
is 

becoming the most important 
challenge for Japanese society,” 
Fukuda said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily.

He 
presented 
several 

statistics on how Japan’s share 
of women in managerial and 
leadership positions, as well as 

the country’s gender pay gap, 
ranked poorly when compared 
to other advanced economies. 
Fukuda also pointed out that 
many women in Japan work 
full-time until childbirth and 
then return to the workforce as 
part-timers after childbirth.

During 
his 
presentation, 

Fukuda 
proposed 
several 

solutions to the issue for a 
nation with policies that have 
worked elsewhere, but aren’t 

working there. Japan’s tax and 
social security laws are based 
on a model where the man earns 
most of the family’s income, but 
Fukuda said these laws should 
be adjusted to the reality of a 
society where more women 
want to continue working full-
time along with their husbands 
after childbirth.

Japan should also abolish 

tax deductions for dependent 
spouses who make less than 

a certain annual income that 
are putting pressure on women 
to stay at home or work part-
time to achieve equity, Fukuda 
added.

Another solution may be to 

implement EU-like labor laws 
to strictly regulate working 
hours. Fukuda said Japan’s 
corporate 
culture, 
which 

stresses loyalty to the company, 
is forcing men to frequently 

On 
a 
campus 
that 
is 

overwhelmingly ‘blue,’ student 
supporters 
of 
Republican 

presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump are in the minority, with 
no official group currently on 
campus for supporters, though the 
candidate has been endorsed by 
the College Republicans.

In a recent Michigan Daily poll 

of 1000 students, respondents 
indicated overwhelming support 
for Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton — 74.3 percent compared 
to only 5.9 percent who said 
they would vote for Trump. In 
the same survey when third-
party candidates were included, 
Libertarian presidential nominee 
Gary Johnson received more than 
double Trump’s support, with 13.2 
percent indicating they would vote 
for Johnson.

In Washtenaw County overall, 

Trump was also the second 
choice, receiving 27.5 percent of 
the county’s vote to Ohio Gov. 
John Kasich’s 34.1 percent in the 
GOP primary earlier this year.

Due to future developmen projects. Lucky Kitchen, located on East University Ave., is closed.

When Jenny Wu learned she 

would have to sell the Lucky 
Kitchen’s 
Central 
Campus 

location to make room for an 
apartment high-rise, she wasn’t 

surprised.

It has been common knowledge 

among the small business owners 
along South University Avenue, 
Wu said, that large property 
developers — attracted by rising 
rents largely paid by students — 
are seeking to acquire real estate 
near Central Campus to erect new 

apartments. The change seemed 
inevitable.

“We heard over the years that 

this was happening, and it was 
just bound to happen to us and we 
just didn’t know when,” Wu said. 
“We were surprised though to be 
the first ones to be approached, so 
we really didn’t have any choice.”

Originally founded in 1993 near 

North Campus and expanding to 
East University Avenue in 2001, 
Lucky Kitchen has become a staple 
of the University of Michigan 
community, winning accolades as 
students’ top choice for the best 
Chinese food on campus.

University of Michigan Theta Xi’s 

decision to host a concert with Detroit 

native rapper Big Sean in October 

has drawn criticism from a number 

of students on campus, as well as the 

UM Black Student Union.

Students cited a prior incident of 

racial insensitivity from the fraternity 

in criticizing their decision to host 

Big Sean, one of the most widely 

popular Black artists. In 2013, Theta 

Xi planned a “Hood Ratchet” themed 

party, sparking campus-wide anger. 

The party, which planned to include 

a “twerking contest” and had various 

gang references in the Facebook 

description, prompted disciplinary 

measures against the fraternity 

and led both the fraternity and the 

University to issue an apology.

 Many on campus argued the 

party and the language of the 

Facebook page parodied Black culture 

and misogynized women. 

After the 2013 incident, the 

University suspended the fraternity 

from the IFC and gave them five 

sanctions, including designing an 

educational program on issues of race 

and attending bystander intervention 

workshops. The fraternity eventually 

cancelled the event and apologized, 

stating the party was not “the 

result of a chapter decision, vote or 

endorsement” despite being created 

with Theta Xi’s name.

The Big Sean event also is 

scheduled on the same date as Black 

Homecoming, a prominent party 

hosted by HEADS and Sister 2 Sister.

In a series of Twitter posts 

Monday afternoon, students 

criticized the concert and said the 

2013 party was what prompted 

#BBUM, a Twitter hashtag later that 

year aimed at allowing Black students 

to share their campus experiences 

which went viral.

The UM frat that tried 2 throw 

a racist party is now trying 2 have 

a concert with a black artist on the 

same day as Black

Music, Theatre & Dance junior 

Diego Zimmerman, speaker of 

the Black Student Union, tweeted, 

“Insult the Black community, bring 

one of the best performers to concert 

at the same time as their annual 

homecoming, more like #ThetaSigh.”

Zimmerman did not respond to a 

request for additional comment at the 

time of this article.

LSA senior Cam Dotson and 

vice president of finance of the 

Interfraternity Council tweeted 

that he thought “theta Xi is moving 

forward with building a positive 

culture and this event is brought 

forward in good faith.” Dotson did 

not wish to give a public statement to 

The Michigan Daily.

 Theta Xi president, Business 

junior Andre Clejan ,and executive 

member and LSA junior Calvin 

Gong did not respond to a request for 

additional comment.

historical Nation of Islam was 
founded in the city in 1931, 
and Eastern European Muslim 
communities, 
composed 
of 

people from countries such as 
Albania and Bosnia, have lived 
in Detroit communities for 
more than 100 years.

Howell also spoke about the 

idea of a Halal space, which 
is a community that develops 
where people live in accordance 
with Muslim law, and Muslims 
can feel comfortable and safe. 
She discussed how these spaces 
come to be defined by factors 
such as territory, behavior and 
group relations.

Howell added that mosques 

are one form of a territorial 
factor, and that community 
relationships 
with 
city 

administration 
or 
other 

government groups lead to the 
forming of Halal spaces. She 
mentioned Hamtramck, which 
is believed to be the first city 
in the United States to elect an 
Arab-majority city council.

“When Muslims do make 

into a space and make it their 

own, that space will change,” 
she said.

Howell 
said 
grassroots 

organizing has played a major 
part in the development of Halal 
spaces. She gave the example of 
a mosque located in northern 
Hamtramck, 
and 
explained 

how its leaders contributed to 
the communities to appeal to 
Muslims who were considering 
leaving the area during the 
housing market collapse of 
2006 by buying and renovating 
houses in the area and renting 
them to Muslim families.

“This is in the city of Detroit 

where you don’t necessarily get 
a lot of government support 
in a neighborhood like this 
one far from public gaze,” she 
said. “This is one example of 
grassroots work.”

Howell said one other local 

organization called Dream of 
Detroit is trying to develop the 
street that they are living on 
near the neighborhood Waverly 
Place. It is near the Muslim 
Center of Detroit, the largest 
African-American mosque in 
the city.

LSA 
senior 
Courtney 

Crawford 
said 
she 
really 

enjoyed the lecture because of 

her lack of previous knowledge 
on the topic, adding that she 
thinks 
Muslim 
communities 

often are misrepresented by the 
media.

“It is something that you 

never hear about because of 
all the negative press on these 
communities and nothing on 
what they are doing,” she said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Leah 

Crockett attended the lecture 
as an extra credit opportunity 
but felt that she was able to 
gain 
a 
better 
perspective 

on communities that she is 
unfamiliar with.

“I learned about the history 

of Detroit in a couple of other 
classes, so it was really nice to 
hear this aspect of it and how it 
applies to Arab-American lives 
and cultures,” she said.

work

and 
neglect 

household 
and 
child-rearing 

duties, which obligates women 
to stay home.

“We need to change the 

game, or the rules of work 
environment,” 
Fukuda 
said. 

“Japanese 
people 
have 
long 

work hours and that’s because 
companies don’t have any laws to 
limit the work hours, so people 
compete with each other to get 
promotions by working a really 
long time.”

He also proposed an additional 

solution based on his experience 
researching 
European 
labor 

and family policies, suggesting 
emulating the policy of the 
Netherlands, 
where 
flexible 

work 
arrangements 
boosted 

female labor participation rates.

Fukuda pointed out that in 

addition to the Dutch labor 
model, which allots more time 
for parents to be with their 
children, salaries between full-
time and part-time employees 
who have the same job are also 
not as disparate as those in 
Japan. Fukuda ended his lecture 
by stressing that “equal pay for 
equal work” is a major key in 
tackling Japan’s labor problems.

“If the Netherlands can do 

that, why not Japan?” he said.

Recently, however, Wu and 

several 
of 
her 
neighbors 
— 

including the owners of Pita Pit 
and Mia Za’s — were compelled 
to sell their downtown lots to 
the 
Missouri-based 
Collegiate 

Development Group for a 13-story, 
91-unit project targeted at student 
tenants.

According to the U.S. Census 

Bureau, the number of housing 
units in structures with at least 20 
units in Ann Arbor has increased 
by 32 percent from 2010 to 2015, 
nearly quadruple Ann Arbor’s 
overall housing growth of 9 
percent. Of the 4,132 housing units 
added to the city in the past five 
years, 73 percent of these units 
have been in buildings housing 10 
or more people.

Many of these housing units 

are in the numerous high-rise 
structures newly erected near 
campus like Sterling Arbor Blu, 
Landmark and Foundry Lofts.

One of the main incentives for 

real estate developers to construct 
more high-rise apartments — high 
rent — also does not seem to be 
abating. In the past five years, 
median rents in the city have 
increased 14 percent to $1,075 per 
month, according to the Census 
Bureau.

Collegiate 
Development 

Group, which is also in the 
process of constructing a 229-
unit apartment off of South Main 
Street, did not respond to requests 
for comment.

The 
insurgence 
of 
new 

residential high-rises — often 
displacing other businesses and 
public spaces — has not been 
without resistance from both 
long-time Ann Arbor residents 
and students.

A proposal to sell a vacant lot 

adjacent to the downtown Ann 
Arbor District Library to a high-
rise developer drew a year-long 
petition drive by local residents, 
many of whom wanted to have 
a public park built in the space, 
aiming to force the decision onto 
the November ballot. In June, 
5,779 signatures were submitted 
to the City Clerk but were rejected 
several 
weeks 
later 
due 
to 

insufficient valid signatures.

At 
September’s 
Board 
of 

Regents meeting, David Schafer, 
Central 
Student 
Government 

president, told the board one of 
his priorities for this semester 
is coordination with the city 
government to alleviate growing 
off-campus housing costs.

As well, during this summer’s 

primary election for City Council, 
several candidates unsuccessfully 
challenged 
incumbents 
with 

platforms including skepticism 

of 
greater 
urban 
residential 

development.

Local attorney Eric Lipson, who 

ran against City Councilmember 
Graydon Krapohl (D–Ward 4) 
in the Democratic primary in 
August, said poorly planned and 
zoned high-rises come at the 
expense of existing residents by 
crowding out green space and 
leading to excess traffic and 
parking congestion.

“I think the majority of city 

residents don’t want to see 
excessive 
development 
that 

impairs the quality of life in 
town,” he said.

Lipson noted, however, that not 

all high-rise developments have 
met pushback from residents, 
comparing the relatively positive 
community 
reception 
to 
the 

Zaragon West building on 402 
Thompson 
St. 
to 
a 
chillier 

reception for the Foundry Lofts 
tower on 413 E. Huron St. He 
said he thinks Zaragon was 
not opposed by most residents 
because 
it 
blended 
into 
an 

already dense area of downtown 
with 
adequate 
infrastructure. 

Meanwhile, Foundry Lofts drew 
ire from citizens because of its 
direct adjacency to a low-density 
historical residential district.

“There are certain areas where 

there are serious mistakes in the 
zoning,” Lipson said. “Foundry 
Lofts was a disaster for all of the 

homes to the north of it … It’s 
shading buildings, it’s causing 
trees to die and it’s having a 
serious 
impact 
beyond 
the 

expectations of when the zoning 
was changed.”

Many of Lipson’s points were 

echoed by local resident Ray 
Detter, leader of the Downtown 
Area Citizen’s Advisory Council, 
which advises local government 
on 
downtown 
planning 

issues. Detter said downtown 
development 
would 
ideally 

allow 
for 
mixed 
residential 

and commercial use as well as 
economic diversity in residents, 
meaning he supports what he 
calls “good” developments such 
as the Liberty Loft condos off 
Second and Williams Streets.

“We’ve 
always 
wanted 
to 

encourage as much diversity in 
the downtown area as possible, 
both in types of people and 
income levels,” Detter said. “We 
were rather surprised by the fact 
that so much of the development 
in the city has been moving in the 
direction of students.”

Detter 
charged 
that 
the 

increase in student high-rises has 
been straining the limited land 
supply of downtown, as well as 
driving away other residents who 
cannot afford the rents charged 
by luxury student apartments.

“If you’re a person such as an 

artist, not making much money, 

where would you move?” Detter 
asked. “There are a lot of people 
who can’t afford $1,200 a bed. In 
the remaining space we’ve got 
downtown, what should we have? 
We’re always in support of more 
housing. But what should the 
housing be, who should it appeal 
to and how should it be designed?”

City 
Councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1) said concerns 
over 
increasing 
residential 

density is not unique to Ann 
Arbor.

“There’s 
been 
a 
lot 
of 

complaints about density in the 
city. These complaints could be 
transposed to nearly any other 
city in the U.S.,” Briere said. 
“Nobody seems to be really happy 
about more housing being built 
in the city, and to some extent we 
all share that concern because 
more housing means more people 
means more wear and tear.”

Briere, who is the council’s 

liaison 
to 
the 
Planning 

Commission, 
noted 
that 
the 

city government does not have 
the power to directly limit new 
development, outside of enforcing 
pre-existing zoning and building 
codes.

“Private 
property 
rights 

are 
very 
strongly 
supported 

by local government because 
they’re required by statewide 
government,” Briere said. “It’s 
difficult 
because 
sometimes 

people think what that we are 
going to stop a development, 
but mostly our job is to allow 
development 
but 
within 

constraints.”

For 
students 
on 
campus, 

the advent of new housing has 
brought 
both 
negatives 
and 

positives — especially when it 
comes to projects that displace 
businesses, like the South U. 
developments.

LSA senior Julian Tabron said 

he thought increased density 
was necessary, but added that 
he has been disappointed by the 
trend of small businesses being 
pushed further from campus 
to make space for new housing, 
particularly Lucky Kitchen.

“I’ve noticed a lot of restaurants 

on South U and East University 
shut down in recent years,” 
Tabron said. “It’s just crazy.”

LSA senior Sydney Ohl said she 

was disappointed by the closure of 
Lucky Kitchen’s Central Campus 
location due to its sentimental 
value — she dined there on the 
day she first moved to Ann Arbor 
as a freshman — though she 
understood the demand for more 
housing.

“Of course we need places for 

students to stay,” Ohl said. “But it’s 
really unfortunate it has to come 
in the way of small businesses, 
especially ones students really 
enjoy having around.”

supporters 
on 
campus 
from 

standing 
by 
their 
candidate, 

there is currently no operational 
Students for Trump chapter on the 
University of Michigan’s campus 
after the leadership of an existing 
chapter graduated last year and 
were not replaced. The University’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
only recently endorsed the Trump-
Pence ticket, several months after 
Trump 
officially 
became 
the 

nominee.

In comparison on campus, there 

is currently an active chapter 
of Students for Clinton and the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats endorsed the nominee 
in July, right after she clinched the 
nomination.

Engineering 
senior 
Kevin 

Kuang is a supporter of Republican 
presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump and was loosely affiliated 
with Students for Trump last year, 
saying he was on the email listserv 
and attended a few group-affiliated 
events, 
though 
he 
stopped 

receiving emails over the summer 
after the leadership graduated.

“I think it was mostly like a 

group of friends that set it up,” 
Kuang said. “Most of them were 
seniors last year and graduated. I 
didn’t follow them too much, but I 
went to a few of their events.”

Because of his general lack 

of involvement in the group 
while it was active, Kuang said 
he was indifferent to the group’s 
dismantlement. He noted that 
he is not a member of College 
Republicans, but considers himself 
to be a conservative and still 
supports the Republican nominee 
because of his economic policies.

“Growing up in Detroit, lower-

middle class, I feel like a lot of his 
policies help out the middle class,” 
Kuang said. “I’ve read through 
all of his visions and policies for 

America and I feel like he’s for me.”

Engineering sophomore Jack 

Kuchta was never a member of 
Students for Trump, but considers 
himself to be a supporter of the 
candidate. Unlike Kuang, who 
rarely feels impacted by the 
generally 
Democratic-leaning 

campus climate, Kuchta said he 
can feel hostility on campus when 
telling people he is supporting 
Trump in the presidential election.

“I was hesitant to join Students 

for Trump, just because of the 
bad vibe I had been getting from 
liberals on campus,” Kuchta said. 
“Last year I purchased a Trump 
shirt as kind of a social experiment, 
to walk around on campus and, 
I guess, see what would happen. 
The reactions were exactly what I 
thought they would be, with a few 
surprises.”

When confronted by people 

with opposing political views on 
campus, Kuang said he asks them 
for reasons why they don’t approve 
of Trump, finding that they 
oftentimes can’t give him a straight 
answer.

“They usually just say he’s a 

racist or bigot and I ask them for 
examples,” Kuang said. “They 
usually tell me, ‘I don’t know too 
much, it’s just what I hear.’ It’s 
mostly media.”

For the most part, however, 

Kuang said he doesn’t often notice 
the political climate on campus or 
among his peers.

“I feel like the majority of people 

don’t really talk about politics 
at all,” Kuang said. “Most of my 
friends and the clubs I’m in know 
I support Trump, but I don’t really 
wear my ‘Make America Great 
Again’ hat outside or anything.” 

Kuchta pointed in particular 

to his experience wearing his 
shirt before a rally by Sen. Bernie 
Sanders (I-VT) on campus in 
March. Walking through campus, 
he said he encountered a group 
of students who harassed and 
threatened him.

“They were just yelling stuff 

like ‘What’s wrong with you?’ and 
‘Why are you wearing that?’, just 
being immature. Honestly, that’s 
what I assumed would happen,” 
Kuchta said.

He noted that he’s also had some 

pleasant surprises, such as a polite 
exchange with a Sanders campaign 
volunteer

“She definitely saw my Trump 

shirt, politely asked if I would 
like a flier, I politely said ‘no,’ then 
she smiled and went on her way,” 
Kuchta said.

Among his peers and friends 

with differing political opinions, 
Kuchta said he’s also had a generally 
more positive experience.

“I’ve 
basically 
picked 
the 

friends who are very liberal, but 
who I know I can actually have a 
good policy debate or actual good 
conversation with, without there 
being animosity,” he said.

Kuchta added that he feels 

it’s disconcerting when he faces 
personal 
attacks 
simply 
for 

expressing support of a candidate.

“Some see me as ‘Oh, you’re a 

racist, you hate Black people, you 
hate Muslims’ and I mean it’s really 
demeaning,” Kuchta said.

Trump made some questionable 

comments in the primaries, Kuchta 
said, adding he is unable to stand 
by everything the candidate says. 
However, he said he would much 
rather vote for Trump when faced 
with the prospect of a Hillary 
Clinton 
presidency, 
especially 

when it comes to the nomination 
to replace conservative justice 
Antonin Scalia’s on the Supreme 
Court.

“I was drawn to him when I saw 

his Supreme Court justice list. A lot 
of conservatives were very happy 
with it,” Kuchta said. “Those picks 
can last a generation, while Trump 
or Hillary will only be there for 
four to eight years; (Trump and 
Clinton) don’t have as big of an 
impact as the choices they pick for 
Supreme Court justices.”

50 percent in comparison to what 
they were last year,” she said.

Young people’s interest in 

living in Detroit is also often cited 
as a reason for market growth 
and rising prices, particularly 
in Detroit’s Historic District 
and trendy neighborhoods. This 
includes areas like Palmer Woods, 
Lafayette Park and Grandmont 
Rosedale, where property values 
never dipped below $50,000, the 
point at which lenders generally 
stop issuing mortgages.

Houses in these areas can now 

go for as much as a few hundred 
thousand dollars. Ryan Cooley, 
owner of O’Connor Real Estate, 
said young people are the main 
reason this area stayed fairly 
stable and now has begun to 
grow.

“We are starting to see people 

want to move here just because of 
the interest in Detroit right now, 
where before it was always ‘I 
grew up in the area’ or that kind 
of thing,” Cooley said.

Though Detroit’s reputation 

includes 
negatives 
— 
there 

remains a high unemployment 
rate and lack of basic services 
— some young people are still 
attracted to the city for their first 
homes, a logic that Mike Seger, a 
music producer living in Detroit’s 
east side, says comes down to 
simple math.

“A young person can move 

here with $10,000 and start up 
a small flex space for artists or 
artists’ studios,” he said. “It’s the 
uprising of the youth being able 
to have the opportunities to make 
a future for themselves.”

Robert Fishman, interim dean 

of the University of Michigan’s 
Taubman College of Architecture 
and Urban Planning, noted that 
while these spikes in housing 
prices represent a wave of 

improvement for the city to come, 
as of now they are contained to 
these wealthier neighborhoods 
like Midtown and Palmer Woods. 
He added that Detroit cannot be 
viewed as one singular market — 
there is the housing market in this 
small bubble of higher income 
downtown, and then there is 
everywhere else in Detroit.

“There are at least two housing 

markets in Detroit, one of which 
is the famous 7.2 square mile 
Downtown and Midtown, which 
is starting to show some life after 
many years of being as stagnant 
as the rest of the city,” he said. 
“Many other parts of the city are 
sadly still under the influence 
of the foreclosure crisis and, if 
anything, have not yet recovered 
from it.”

Urban 
Planning 
Prof. 

Margaret Dewar attributed the 
dual market in Detroit to the 
large number of residents who 
have left poorer areas, leaving 
behind few residents and many 
abandoned homes.

“In 
some 
neighborhoods 

prices are increasing, but in 
other neighborhoods they are 
not because population has 
continued to decline,” Dewar 
said. “I’m worried that those 
will be neighborhoods that do 
not realize price and demand 
increases because there are just 
not as many households.”

Interest in Detroit isn’t just 

growing among young people — 
many academic fields now use 
Detroit’s trajectory as a sort of 
case study upon which theories 
and examples can be applied. In 
2012, a lecture series called “The 
Detroit School: Conversations 
in Urban Studies” was started 
in the Taubman College that 
created a concentration within 
the 
college 
specifically 
on 

Detroit. 
This 
establishment 

makes 
Detroit 
the 
third 

American city, behind Chicago 
and Los Angeles, to serve as 

the concentration for a field of 
study.

“Detroit is neither a dense, 

industrial 
Chicago 
nor 
a 

sprawling, 
fast-growing, 

immigrant-rich Los Angeles,” 
reads the program’s website. 
“Yet Detroit is representative 
of a host of cities that have 
experienced 
sustained 
and 

substantial deindustrialization, 
depopulation, 
and 

disinvestment since World War 
II”

Dewar, who serves as faculty 

advisor to the program, said the 
purpose of this program is to help 
students not only understand 
the city, but also to help improve 
it through collaboration with 
organizations 
and 
groups 

invested in Detroit.

Fishman said he thinks the 

recovery of Detroit has been a 
long and strenuous process, but 
now that it is underway, the city 
will be back soon with more to 
offer than ever before.

“It is my belief that the 

recovery of Detroit has been 
slower than the recovery of any 
other major American city but 
it’s definitely underway and I 
think it will be one of the most 
striking recoveries of any city in 
recent years,” he said.

He said University students 

can 
benefit 
from 
seeing 

Detroit both as an example for 
understanding urban planning 
and economics concepts, but 
also as a hands-on learning 
experience if students engage 
with the city and get involved.

“There 
certainly 
are 
a 

great many opportunities for 
University of Michigan students 
that simply did not exist 10 or 20 
years ago, such as being a part of 
this growth and transformation, 
and I think that’s a good thing,” 
he said. “Healthy cities thrive 
in part by people who have a 
choice choosing to come there 
and stay there.”

HOUSING
From Page 1


I 

got a job offer the other 
day and since then, I’ve 
been thinking about how 

annoying it will be that I’ll 
probably have to start shaving 
my armpits again. Since all the 
communist 
lesbian 
farmers 

in this town who want to put 
taco trucks everywhere have 
radicalized me, I’ve disowned 
razors and burned all my bras. 
I’m 
half 
joking: 
Sometimes 

I shave my legs because my 
leggings pull on my leg hair 
and it feels like when you leave 
your hair in a ponytail for too 
long, and sometimes I wear a 
bra because my shirt is made of 
mesh and there’s only so much 
nipple I’m willing to expose to 
my Spanish class.

For the most part though, 

no one really bothers me about 
my hair and boobs while I’m in 
school — which they shouldn’t 
because fuck them, I’m not here 
for their evaluations of my body.

But when I got my job offer, 

I realized I’d have to enter the 
sexist labor market that can 
in fact legally tell me what to 
do with my body hair, boobs, 
makeup, etc. and punish me if I 
don’t comply (i.e. fire me).

Maybe I was wrong, though, 

so I Googled something like 
“Is it legal for an employer to 
make you shave your legs?” and 
came across this gem of a Yahoo 
Answers page. I generally try 
to avoid Yahoo Answers and 
comments sections everywhere, 
but I think that sometimes we 
have a responsibility to sift 

through the muck of these 
relatively 
anonymous 
online 

forums because it can be a good 
place to access peoples’ (and 
by 
extension, 
our 
culture’s) 

unfiltered attitudes, assumptions 
and biases.

So, the situation: The original 

poster, Ashley K., is asking a 
question for a woman friend who 
works at Sears and apparently 
was told by her boss that she 
either needs to shave her legs 
or not show her legs at work. 
Ashley K. asks the people of 
Yahoo Answers (from now on 
referred to as the POYA) if this 
“ultimatum” is legal or if it 
constitutes some kind of gender 
discrimination. Ashley K. also 
makes it clear that she doesn’t 
give a shit about your opinions 
on women shaving or not shaving 
their legs; she just wants to know 
the legal stuff.

The POYA predictably give her 

their opinions instead of pointing 
her to the website of, say, the 
Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission. The POYA say, 
yes, requiring women to shave 
their legs for work is definitely 
legal, since no, it’s not a matter 
of gender discrimination, it’s a 
matter of “hygiene” and “dress 
codes.” We’ve accepted that 
men and women have different 
“appearance 
standards,” 
and 

hey, men have to shave their 
beards so yeah, obviously ladies 
need to shave their legs. And if 
she’s really gonna complain so 
much about it, “she can always 
find another job.” 

The POYA argue that a dress 

code/hygiene 
standard 
that 

requires 
women 
employees 

to shave their legs does not 

constitute gender discrimination 
because such a rule merely 
reflects our social understanding 
of the proper ways for women 
and men to present and conduct 
themselves in public.

Though 
the 
POYA 
aren’t 

especially 
eloquent, 
they’ve 

actually 
synthesized 
pretty 

well the outcome of the 1989 
Supreme Court ruling in Price 
Waterhouse v. Hopkins. In Price 
Waterhouse, the Supreme Court 
ruled that gender stereotyping is 
a form of sex discrimination and 
is therefore illegal. The issue in 
the case was that Ann Hopkins 
was denied partnership at her 
accounting firm because in an 
evaluation of her work, men in 
charge of her wrote that she was 
too “macho” and suggested she 
take “a course in charm school.” 

So, while employers can’t say 

and do explicitly sexist stuff 
like that anymore, what sexism 
they’re legally allowed to enforce 
through dress codes is a bit 
murkier. The Workplace Fairness 
organization 
claims 
that 
in 

the vein of Price Waterhouse, 
if a woman employee who 
wears pants or does something 
else 
gender-bending 
faces 

discrimination, she might have a 
case of sex discrimination based 
on gender stereotyping.

But, the same website also 

says that the ruling in Price 
Waterhouse has not prevented 
employers from having different 
dress codes for men and women.

Embracing the alt-right

Weaving words together 

O

ur 
country, 
like 
any 

other, 
experiences 

horribly tragic events 

that redefine our history — tragic 
events that imprint themselves 
into the minds of every American 
and go on to influence policy 
decisions years afterward. The 
resulting 
aftermath 
of 
these 

events is often met 
with 
temporary 

panic and confusion. 
Despite 
these 

feelings being brief, 
as a society we seek 
out specific answers 
and 
facts 
about 

such events hoping 
to 
prevent 
such 

heinous acts from 
happening 
again. 

From 
establishing 

investigative 
congressional 

commissions 
that 
use 
every 

resource available within the 
country, to increasing funding for 
our already massive intelligence 
and defense departments, we go 
to unbelievable lengths to seek 
actual truths.

Yet these searches for truth 

among the rubble are often 
plagued with fringe members 
of society not just questioning, 
but completely denying verified 
factual 
evidence. 
Conspiracy 

theorists 
construct 
fantastical 

positions 
and 
unverifiable 

stories that they believe reveal 
the actual “truth.” For example, 
after the tragedy of Sept. 11, they 
capitalized on the disaster and 
began searching for false evidence 
in the pursuit of discovering some 
massive 
conspiracy 
the 
U.S. 

government 
had 
orchestrated. 

Sept. 11 served as the leading 
story for which these theorists 
achieved moderate levels of fame 
with their nearly hysterical rants 
and positions — positions that 
went on for 15 years, buttressed by 
even more heinous and ridiculous 
theories that incorporated the 
same racist and nationalistic 

themes as before. All 
during this time, their 
online presence helped 
form 
and 
organize 

segments of the “alt-
right,” solidifying their 
place on the furthest 
right end of American 
politics. 
Thankfully, 

their fact-free tirades 
are accepted only by 
a mere sliver of our 
population. They stayed 

on the fringes of accepted political 
discourse, and they and their 
followers are rightly categorized 
as conspiracy theorists.

Today, 
conspiracy 
theorists 

use these events as excuses to 
scream their racist and nativist 
positions barely hidden under 
the unbelievable theories they 
construct. Their community is 
stricken with white nationalism, 
xenophobia, 
anti-Semitism 

and 
a 
crippling 
degree 
of 

blind chauvinism. Within our 
hyperconnected digital world, 
their 
deplorable 
rhetoric 
is 

so easily transmitted to the 
misinformed 
and 
misled 
in 

order to grow their support. 
Most recently, these conspiracy 
theorists 
have 
gained 
new 

supporters from the uppermost 
levels of presidential politics.

The 
arrival 
of 
the 
15th 

anniversary of Sept. 11 runs 
in 
tandem 
with 
Republican 

nominee 
Donald 
Trump’s 

campaign’s embrace of groups 
that believe the tragic events of 
9/11 were orchestrated by the 
U.S. government. The campaign 
has brought these disturbing, 
factually inept, racist, right-
wing 
populist 
groups 
into 

presidential politics as sources 
of truth and fact.

It is important to see how 

this specific niche of ultra-right-
wing American politics has been 
accepted as verifiable sources. 
As noted by The Rachel Maddow 
Show on Sept. 8, Donald Trump 
has been using infowars.com, 
(a popular conspiracy theorist 
website 
calling 
for 
a 
revolt 

against the so-called “New World 
Order”) not only as a source 
of factual reporting, but as an 
accredited media outlet in which 
he has conducted interviews 
and embraced the leaders of 
these fact-free, white nationalist 
websites. Trump’s campaign has 
validated these fringe groups of 
extreme reactionaries as factual 
sources of news. Groups that 
were rightly shunned for their 
deplorable rhetoric and ridiculous 
theories 
now 
apparently 
are 

sources of fact for a major party 
nominee seeking election to the 
most powerful position in the 
country. Unsurprisingly, Trump 
has become the unifying member 
of the alt-right movement. His 
campaign has been built on attacks 
against the media, intellectualism, 
elites, 
immigrants, 
minorities 

and liberals, and this has finally 
come to head with the gathering 

of these collective conspiracy 
theorists supporting him.

What is so disturbing is that 

Republican leaders continue to 
support this campaign, which 
has now reached new levels 
of insanity by embracing and 
continuing to use conspiracy 
theorist 
websites 
as 
factual 

news. The Trump campaign 
has praised the leaders of these 
right-wing, 
fact-free 
groups. 

These are leaders who believe 
that the Clinton family murders 
their adversaries, believe the 
shootings of Aurora, Sandy Hook 
and Orlando were orchestrated 
by the government simply to 
enact more gun control and 
believe the U.S. military has 
“weather weapons” that it uses 
against its citizens. The current 
presidential nominee of the 
Republican Party is using a 
website that believes juice boxes 
are lined with chemicals that 
can make your children gay as a 
factual source of news.

This terrifying reality is what 

the Republican Party has chosen. 
This is their candidate, and the 
lack of disavowal of his abnormal 
presidential 
campaign 
reveals 

the consequences of the intense 
partisanship within our country. 
The embracement of the alt-right 
and conspiracy theorists from the 
Trump campaign is yet another of 
the countless examples of Trump 
campaign’s ineptitude — and why 
Trump is truly dangerous to the 
future of our country.

L

ast night, a friend of 
mine 
told 
me 
about 

quipu, the system used 

by the Incas to keep track of 
numerical information. Quipus, 
also known as “talking knots,” 
are made up of thousands of 
knotted strings, which, when 
examined 
by 
a 

contemporary judge 
or 
clerk, 
reveal 

certain 
financial 

information. 
Quipucamayocs, 
or 

quipu 
specialists, 

were like a modern-
day accountant or 
stenographer 
— 

recording what they 
saw around them.

This conversation 

triggered 
a 
series 

of questions for me. Most 
prominently: What does our 
culture 
lose 
from 
having 

information at our fingertips 
at all times? Is there something 
to be gained in needing to 
knot together pieces of fabric 
to, 
for 
example, 
calculate 

certain statistics? Why has 
contemporary society chosen 
to 
move 
in 
the 
direction 

of 
making 
information, 

pertaining 
to 
essentially 

any subject, instantaneously 
available?

It seems that today’s world 

gears itself toward eliminating 
the amount of irretrievable 
material out there — questions 
we do not know how to answer. 
Our world eliminates questions 
that, when posed, we have 
nothing to hold or point to as 
the correct response. What’s 
the capital of Djibouti? What’s 
489 x 333? 162,837. I look the 
question up; I answer it based 
on what my phone tells me, 
then, in a way, I feel as if I know 
the answer, as if I am the one 
feeding the information to the 
world. 

But 
what 
happens 
with 

so-called irretrievable answers? 
Questions about which we can 
only deliberate and discuss, 
guess at and witness? Instances 
where we don’t just look up 
an answer force us to talk to 
one another, to put our own 
theories and ideas to the test 
of the community — the people 
with 
whom 
we 
surround 

ourselves. And this is why we 
make friends in the first place! 
To have people in our lives with 
whom we can shape our own 
perspectives. Because we need 
other people to do this. We 
cannot do this, any of this, on 
our own.

But instead of acknowledging 

and embracing this fact — it’s a 

beautiful thing to recognize 
one’s place within a community 
where 
every 
member 
feels 

a vibrant, pulsing need for 
everybody else — we isolate 
ourselves 
into 
our 
own 

machines, 
away 
from 
each 

other and away from our own 

working, conscious 
minds. Sitting in a 
lecture taking notes 
on my computer, I 
am an automaton, 
typing 
the 
words 

the 
professor 

says 
without 

consideration. 
Shouldn’t we talk 
about the topics we 
are learning about 
to each other as we 
learn about them?

In so many of my classes, we 

talk about the importance of 
considering who is telling the 
story, and which narrative we 
are supposed to believe as fact. 
In my field of American Studies, 
we believe no singular narrative 
can be called objectively true. 
Instead, we piece together ideas 
from literature, film, music, 
theater, commercials, etc. to 
get a sense of how people and 
entire communities described 
a certain moment or place. How 
these ideas stacked up against 
each other, how they clashed 
and fought and played and 
agreed with each other. And 
then we go from there, to form 
our own beliefs — constantly 
checking 
ourselves 
and 

checking the notions provided 
to us by scholars, authors and 
artists alike.

In 
a 
study 
published 

in 
Psychological 
Science, 

social 
psychology 
graduate 

student 
Pam 
A. 
Muller 

and Associate Professor of 
Cognitive Psychology Daniel 
M. 
Oppenheimer, 
found 

that 
the 
process 
of 
using 

computers solely to take notes 
— even without other alerts and 
windows popping up — results 
in shallower processing. There 
is something gained by taking 
notes 
by 
hand, 
especially 

when we rephrase the words 
of our professor into our own. 
By doing this, we check our 
professor and run their ideas 
through our own filter. This 
combination — their minds 
with ours — produces what we 
learn.

The 
emphasis 
on 
blind, 

instant 
knowledge 
extends 

to how we consume political 
coverage as well. Every day, 
we 
read 
headlines 
about 

new 
speeches 
presidential 

candidates give, trading barbs 

and insults and, rarely, new 
policy proposals. We discard 
the candidates’ histories as 
archaic 
and 
outdated 
and 

irrelevant, opting instead to 
consider who they are today, 
right now. And here, once again, 
we are not meant to question 
these figures or to question 
the system. We are meant to 
consume it all, automatons, 
stuck 
with 
two 
candidates 

whom a heavy majority of us 
believe to be corrupt.

From peers and colleagues 

and pundits alike, I often hear 
the following political mode of 
thought: I really wish things 
could be better in this way, 
but that’s unrealistic, so, they 
can’t improve, so I have to 
vote for Clinton/Trump. And 
nothing frustrates me more. 
Because this mindset operates 
under the belief that “we, the 
people” have no power, that our 
votes do not impact anything, 
that we and the system are 
somehow 
separate 
entities. 

That we are nothing more than 
spectators packed into the Big 
House, cheering and booing 
and yelling, unable to actually 
impact what we witness.

If we all got together in 

forums and discussions and 
all heard ourselves describing 
the world with this defeatist 
logic, we would soon discover 
we do have power, and if we 
all actually want to change the 
world for the better, we have 
the means to do it. In Greece, 
the current ruling political 
party was founded in 2004, and 
polled around 4 percent for the 
first few years of its existence — 
the Green Party in the United 
States polls at this same figure 
today.

Change 
happens 
quickly 

and abruptly if we provide the 
space for it. But that space will 
only come if we engage each 
other and hear each other. And 
by “hear each other,” I don’t 
mean to type verbatim each 
other’s words. Because this is 
not learning.

Instead, we ought to weave 

together, like the Incas, all of 
the ideas that we ourselves 
have, along with those that 
we consume. And as we knit, 
we can add our own flair and 
flavor to the project, no doubt 
fundamentally influenced by 
those around us, but ultimately 
creating an ideology uniquely 
our own.

Tuesday, September 20, 2016 — 5

Stunning, jarring, intriguing, 

scary — all apt descriptors for 
hullaballoo that has been the lat-
est iteration of New York Fashion 
Week. To provide some nuanced 
imagery about the past week, your 
Daily Style writers have compiled 
a few of their favorite collections 
that graced this season’s runway.

Kithland
Kith, for the most part, is a stark 

contrast from Fashion Week’s tra-
ditional mainstays. Largely for 
that very reason, their New York 
debut was met with a flurry of 
surprise and intrigue. In embrac-
ing and celebrating the label’s 
newfound stage (and audiences), 
founder Ronnie Fieg took the 
opportunity to craft an experi-
ence, stylized “KITHLAND,” that 
deviated far from the conventions 
of a typical runway show, stream-
ing his new digs to the masses 
online and allowing fans of his 
to relive the experience through 
virtual reality at one of his many 
flagship Manhattan stores. 

With an audience that boasted 

the likes of Iman Shumpert and Ja 
Rule, Fieg had much of the mod-
ern hype machine intently watch-
ing for what Fieg had in store. He 
split his show into three different 
offerings, “City,” “Mountain” and 
“Beach” (for his upcoming Miami 
flagship store), respectively, with 
the show conveying much of 
Fieg and Kith’s bread and but-
ter, showcasing a cohesive mix of 
flashy sneakers and ’90s throw-
back couture. 

Kith 
has 
been 
experienc-

ing a gradual rise in clout and 
popularity 
among 
Manhattan 

and streetwear’s more cultured 
patrons, but in Kithland, Fieg 
cemented his label’s newfound 
status as fashion’s “nouvelle élite,” 
adding patrons of high fashion to 
his ever-growing list of fans. 

— Anay Katyal

Tommy Hilfiger
Tommy Hilfiger was the talk 

of day three of New York Fashion 
Week as he debuted the brand’s 
first ever “see-now-buy-now” col-
lection, called #TOMMYNOW. 
The designer, well known for 
going above and beyond with 
runway design, featured a car-
nival theme to set the stage for 
Hilfiger’s 
collaboration 
with 

supermodel Gigi Hadid. The 
21-year-old Vogue regular sport-
ed a slew of looks that embodied 
the usual themes of Hilfiger’s 
design: 
all-American, 
nautical 

and classic.

Combining 
Hadid’s 
image 

with the brand allowed Hilfiger 
to appeal to a younger market. 
Hadid, a Victoria’s Secret Angel, 
gives the classic brand a youthful 
twist, especially since the Hilfiger 
brand has existed since 1985, and 
was in serious need of a revamp. 
Through the Fall 2016 collection, 
Hilfiger and Hadid provided sev-
eral new personalities — for start-
ers, the collection can be bought 
in stores right now and not in six 
months, as is usual with Fashion 
Week collections. Additionally, 
the clothes took Hilfiger’s classic 
look and made it attractive, com-

fortable and stylish.

Jason Wu
“Florals — for spring? Ground-

breaking.”

Jason Wu’s spring 2017 collec-

tion is heavy on florals, but still 
breaks boundaries.

Wu’s spring collection is full of 

dichotomies, yet feels effortless 
and fluid. The collection begins 
with heavy navys paired with iri-
descent blues and shifts towards 
nudes and neons. Wu uses dark 
colors traditionally more suited 
for fall with lightweight fabrics — 
though this isn’t a new tactic for 
the designer, who relied heavily 
on stiff, dark shades in his spring 
2016 collection.

Perhaps the pops of color and 

nudes seen near the end of his 
show were a concession to the 
more traditional spring fare. His 
collection was focused on both 
the creation of flow through the 
use of draping and pairing with 
other pieces which use rigid neon 
lines to create structure. But 
despite the collection’s variety, it 
still feels cohesive, and new: flo-
rals are fresh. 

— Emma Kinery

Vera Wang
Vera Wang showcased a mono-

chromatic style at Fashion Week 
this year. The designer, who’s 
been moving towards collections 
solely in black and white in the 
past few years, definitely stuck to 
that theme.

The looks were not intricate — 

simple skirts, shorts and cropped 
tops, paired with oversize jackets 
and blazers — but were chic and 
fitting to the brand’s minimalist 

theme. The designer also opted 
for a natural hair and makeup 
for the models, and all the mod-
els sported the same black socks 
and black boots. Overall, the 
designer chose for her entire 
show, collection and appeal all to 
adhere to “less is always more.” 
In doing so, spectators can focus 
on the clothes, what they bring 
to the wearer’s body and how 
the simplistic designs differ ever 
so slightly from one another. 
No surprises from Wang, as the 
brand played to its strengths and 
provided Fashion Week with an 
artistically modest, yet elegant 
and nuanced, collection. 

— Isobel Futter

Carolina Herrera
The show began with perhaps 

the strongest look in the collec-
tion: a structured denim dress 
a la Britney Spears at the 2001 
VMAs, except it was channeling 
elegance rather than gaudiness. 
That being said, not all of the 
pieces in the collection strode the 
same path. Herrera’s collection 
is mainly black and white, with 
some striped pieces feeling more 
circus than chic.

The focus was on making the 

everyday picnic style feel evening 
and in that it succeeded, even if on 
the individual level it felt tired: at 
times the ties on several sleeves 
of the looks were a bit much. She 
made fabrics and patterns from 
the everyday — white blousey 
cotton, denim, gingham — into 
the spectacular. Herrera’s use of 
structure compensates for the 
areas which feel less refined and 
makes pieces like this black coat-
dress shine.

TV REVIEW

DAILY STYLE WRITERS

All you need to know from the stylish 
craziness of NY Fashion Week SS17

Daily Style Writers recap the biggest showcases of the week

Within the first 20 minutes 

or so of “Snowden,” Nicolas 
Cage 
(“National 
Treasure”), 

playing a teacher 
at a CIA train-
ing 
facility, 

engages Edward 
Snowden (Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt, 
“Inception”) 
in a conversa-
tion about vice. 
The 
back-and-

forth goes a bit 
something like this: Cage asks 
Gordon-Levitt what his vice is. 
Gordon-Levitt says he doesn’t 
drink or do drugs. Cage retorts 
that he must have a vice. Gor-
don-Levitt replies, “Comput-
ers, I guess.” Cage says, “Well, 
this sure is a whorehouse of 
computers…”

From there on, it’s just more 

of the same. A not-so-small 
percentage of time, the dia-
logue is unbearable. Quips like 
these are consistent through-
out film. They left me and 
those around me in the theater 
laughing at the sheer absur-
dity of the things being said in 
supposedly serious, emotional 
scenes. Another highlight in 
absolute trash dialogue occurs 
after Snowden makes it onto 
the news after talking with 

The Guardian. We see Cage’s 
character sitting in a La-Z-Boy, 
smoking a cigarette in front of 
his television set in a ’70s-style 
home. He exclaims from his 
recliner, “He did it!” and the 

scene cuts away.

But if bad dia-

logue was the only 
problem the movie 
had, it could have 
still been a decent 
production. 
Unfortunately, the 
rest of the movie 
follows suit — at 
least stylistically, 

the quality doesn’t improve. At 
one point, Snowden has a sei-
zure and Gordon-Levitt falls to 
the ground to do his best reen-
actment of this medical emer-
gency. What makes it awful is 
the way director Oliver Stone 
(“Platoon”) chooses to portray 
the experience of a seizure. 
Snowden is cooking up some 
spaghetti, and his glasses start 
to fog from the steam. The cam-
era and his body begin to wob-
ble back and forth. The screen 
becomes stained with the same 
fog that was on his glasses. 
Randomly, the movie switches 
to a point-of-view shot as Gor-
don-Levitt falls to the ground, 
and in blurred vision, his girl-
friend rushes over. The whole 
scene turns a serious medical 
scenario into a hokey plot-point 

action scene.

The movie mostly revolves 

around Snowden finding out 
new and creepier information 
about what the NSA is doing. 
He finds something out. He is 
disturbed by it. He doesn’t do 
anything about it. This cycle 
continues until the end, when 
Snowden 
(surprise!) 
finally 

does something about it. The 
story jumps back and forth in 
time between the interview 
with The Guardian in his hotel 
room in Hong Kong and the 
events that have taken place in 
the last few years. Much of the 
movie is told with one of the 
interviewers asking Snowden 
a question and him narrating 
the scene that takes place on 
screen. The storytelling feels 
cheap, like a shortcut to certain 
events in Edward Snowden’s 
life.

The movie ends with an 

interview in an auditorium 
where Snowden appears on 
a computer monitor from his 
current residence in Russia. At 
the very end of the interview, 
the movie cuts back to Edward 
Snowden — the real Edward 
Snowden, not Joseph Gordon-
Levitt. Dramatically, this cut 
to the real person adds nothing. 
It feels like a trick, like Stone is 
saying “Hey! Look! This movie 
is based on a real person.” Yes, 
we know.

FILM REVIEW

Frank Zappa once said in an 

interview, “I don’t think any-
body has ever seen the real Frank 
Zappa, 
because 

being interviewed 
is one of the most 
abnormal 
things 

that you can do 
to 
somebody.” 

Zappa’s words are 
a warning label, 
a way to tell the 
audience 
that 

the person in the 
documentary 
is 

not the person it’s portraying. 
For the next 90 minutes, audi-
ences see interviews in which 
this abnormality is explored, 
diving into the idiosyncrasies 
of Zappa. Can anything he says 
be taken seriously, or is every-
thing just another act? Regard-
less of his warning, “Eat That 
Question: Frank Zappa in His 
Own Words” is the closest thing 
fans will get to knowing the real 
musical mastermind.

Thorsten Schütte (“Namib-

ia Generation X”), a director 
known for TV documentaries, 
retells Zappa’s diverse career 
from his bicycle orchestra on 
“The Steve Allen Show” to 
his battle with cancer. Rather 
than rely on narration, Schüt-
te exclusively uses footage of 
interviews and live perfor-
mances. Zappa is such a dis-
tinct personality that he is the 
only qualified source to recount 
his work. Any other efforts to 

illustrate his career are futile. 
Watching a random music his-
torian try to talk about him 
would feel phony, something 
Zappa would find hilarious.

Zappa was no stranger to 

slander 
in 
the 

press, 
and 
the 

media 
was 
just 

another 
instru-

ment for Zappa 
to 
manipulate. 

“Eat That Ques-
tion” 
addresses 

false claims, like 
the 
idea 
that 

Zappa frequently 
used 
psyche-

delic drugs, with vengeance. 
His disapproval toward drugs 
may not shock devoted fans, 
but those influenced by these 
media reports will be surprised 
to hear Zappa never took LSD 
and disliked marijuana, because 
his workaholic tendencies and 
endless discography would have 
been dampened. If there needed 
to be an anti-drug role model in 
the 20th Century, it should have 
been Zappa.

The documentary juxtaposes 

the interviews and Zappa’s zany 
performances to discover the 
motives behind his acts. Every 
lyric and every charade had a 
purpose, and there was never 
fluff in any of his material. The 
documentary, 
unfortunately, 

fails to live up to such high stan-
dards at all moments. Though 
predominantly 
engaging, 
it 

overstays its welcome when 
introducing his brief tenure as a 
pseudo-ambassador for Czecho-

slovakia. Although this displays 
Zappa’s eclectic life, it feels like 
a digression from what impact-
ed fans the most: his music. 

“Eat That Question” does not 

attempt to summarize Zappa’s 
entire life; basic facts like his 
date of birth or miscellaneous 
trivia can be found easily and 
don’t require a documentary. 
Rather, it uses Zappa’s own 
words to give the viewer insight 
into the meaning behind his off-
beat melodies and mockery.

Zappa satirized everything 

from the hippie subculture to 
new wave music; every trend 
was prone to his wrath. If he 
found something depressing or 
uninspiring, he didn’t shy away 
from saying it. For him, the 
obsequious nature of Ameri-
cans was despicable. “Eat That 
Question” features an extended 
look at “Bobby Brown,” a song 
that scrutinizes the American 
Dream. “Bobby Brown” shows 
Zappa’s eccentricity and skepti-
cal outlook most efficiently, and 
the retelling of this song feels 
funnier than ever.

In an age when fitting in is 

optimal and individuality is 
thrown out thanks to social 
media, everyone can learn a 
lot from Zappa. He proved that 
distinguishing oneself from the 
crowd is what makes us whole. 
The documentary highlights his 
authenticity and inspires view-
ers to not live blindly. Although 
it lags at times, “Eat That Ques-
tion” 
successfully 
resurrects 

Zappa’s legacy for a new genera-
tion of music lovers.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

There’s no such thing as a 

perfect awards show. Sure, it 
might be odd to open this way in 
a review of what 
was, by and large, 
one of the best 
Emmy Awards I’ve 
ever seen, but it’s 
true. Even the most 
generous of awards 
committees 
can’t 

honor 
every 

deserving 
recipi-

ent, and that’s not 
even 
consider-

ing the sheer number of scripted 
television shows that aired in the 
past year, or taking into account 
the fact that one man’s deserving 
recipient is another man’s over-
rated trash. And then there’s the 
entirely different, but still tangen-
tially connected, train of thought 
that leads to difficult questions 
like, “Wait, why do I care about 
this?” and “Does any of this even 
matter, in the grand scheme of 
things?” So imagine my surprise 
— an apt word to describe Sun-
day’s telecast — at an Emmys that 
was satisfying, efficient and … 
kind of great?

The first sign of a pleasant 

surprise: Jimmy Kimmel was 
funny. His late-night persona 
often smacks of smug, smarmy 
comedy, but after overcoming a 
painfully unfunny pre-recorded 
intro, Kimmel was energetic, 
brisk and agreeable. (I will con-
tinue to ride for Andy Samberg’s 
performance last year as long as 
I have to — we must protect his 
ascension to Steve Carell-level 
national treasure.) The sand-
wiches stunt and predictable 
Matt Damon bit played well; 
even the introductions and one-
liners landed effectively. As one 
can only hope good hosts will do, 
he kept things moving.

And to be sure, despite FX 

and HBO’s relative dominance 
(specifically “The People vs. O.J. 
Simpson: American Crime Story” 
and “Game of Thrones”), the 
highlight of this year’s ceremony 

was how the com-
mittee found ways 
to honor the less-
er-publicized 
but 

truly worthy per-
formances, 
writ-

ing and direction. 
Louie 
Anderson’s 

win for his deeply 
odd but stunning 
performance 
on 

“Baskets” was a 

sure sign of changing, more com-
prehensive tides. Aziz Ansari 
and Alan Yang’s writing on the 
“Parents” episode on “Master 
of None” — which was, for me, a 
bit overrated — was still heart-
warming to see honored, and led 
to one of the better speeches of 
the night. And “Transparent” ’s 
Jill Soloway’s award for directing 
“Man On The Land” was a much-
deserved underdog win against 
HBO heavyweights “Veep” and 
“Silicon Valley.”

It would be difficult to talk 

about this year’s ceremony with-
out also mentioning the number 
of genuinely moving acceptance 
speeches, from Patton Oswalt’s 
short, touching shoutout to his late 
wife to Jeffrey Tambor’s under-
stated but impassioned plea for 
inclusivity to Julia Louis-Drey-
fus’s tearful tribute to her father. 
It’s weird to judge people on their 
specific brands of stunned grati-
tude, especially when they’ve just 
been judged on their actual work, 
but Rami Malek and Sarah Paul-
son deserve the unofficial Emmy 
Award for Outstanding Accep-
tance Speeches. Malek’s perfectly 
paced and delivered ode to “all 
the Elliots out there” comes sec-
ond only to Paulson’s retroactive 
and heartfelt apology to the real 
Marcia Clark.

Yes, we can complain about 

certain omissions. “The Ameri-
cans,” while finally being nomi-
nated after four seasons of thriller 
perfection, still failed to win an 
award outside of Margo Martin-
dale’s repeat Guest Actress win, 
though Malek’s win over the 
incredible Matthew Rhys is hard 
to argue with. Tatiana Maslany 
also pulled off the upset over 
Keri Russell in recognition of the 
utterly transfixing body of work 
she’s put together as a whole in 
“Orphan Black.” “Fargo,” whose 
second season was one of the 
most perfect seasons of television 
in recent memory, also went home 
empty-handed. (I’d be remiss if I 
didn’t somehow throw Bokeem 
Woodbine’s name in here some-
where, so there. That’s his name, 
and his performance in “Fargo” 
is one I’ll never forget.) And I’d 
rather not discuss the utter disre-
spect shown to “The Leftovers,” 
which is, in this writer’s opinion, 
the best show on television and 
the recipient of a whopping total 
of zero nominations.

But it’s tough to complain 

about an Emmys that awarded 
hard-working actors like Sterling 
K. Brown and Courtney B. Vance, 
finally honored the comedic bril-
liance that is “Key and Peele” and 
found “SNL” ’s first openly lesbian 
cast member, Kate McKinnon, at 
a rare loss for words. It’s an easy 
line to draw from the Emmys’ 
general air of progressive poli-
tics to the standard “TV is doing 
diversity better than movies” 
argument. It is, of course, not that 
simple. There’s still work to be 
done. Still, the 2016 Emmys were 
a heartwarming celebration of 
“Peak TV” and how much more 
is possible on television than ever 
before. As Leslie Jones put it in 
the night’s most optimistic, con-
fident and touching segment, the 
Emmys just wanted to feel beauti-
ful, y’all.

TV REVIEW

NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

For the Daily

Jimmy Kimmel hosts a surprisingly 
successful Emmy Awards on ABC

“Game of Thrones” and “American Crime Story” win big

I

’ve always had an underly-
ing suspicion that I could be 
incredible at baseball.

Not right away, of course. But 

maybe if I trained hard for say, 
three years 
or so, I could 
be terrific. I 
could thrive 
on the lack 
of prolonged 
running, or 
indulge in 
the hilarious 
furtiveness of 
the steal. It’s 
completely 
unfounded 
in any sense 
of reality; 
the game of baseball just has a 
universality that makes even the 
most uncoordinated of litera-
ture columnists dream of major 
leagues.

Every game of baseball is a 

story, with primal, relatable 
goals and high stakes that will 
make you stop scarfing down 
peanuts for a second and watch. 
Perhaps this is why American 
literature has paid so much trib-
ute to baseball, even as baseball 
falls out of favor to more com-
plicated, hurried games.

Baseball in our current cul-

tural landscape means some-
thing much different than what 
it means on the page — today, 
the average salary for a pro 
baseball player is four million 
dollars. When my grandfather 
was invited to play for the New 
York Yankees in 1951, he turned 
it down because he had two kids 
and could make more money as a 
truck driver for a beer company.

When baseball was becom-

ing synonymous with American 
ideals, there wasn’t the absurd 
financial incentive that exists 
for ball players today. There was 
only a love of the game. But now 
even though the players are mil-
lionaires, the history of baseball 
in this country still goes deep 
enough to make it an integral 
part of American literature.

Americans have been living 

out their fantasies of baseball 
vicariously through the English 
language since the game’s inven-
tion in 1839 in New York. But the 
stories we hear are rarely basic 
stories of winning and losing 
— baseball lends itself as a meta-
phor for the human experience. 
It accepts projection of sadness, 
loss, mirth and triumph. Stories 
like Ernest Lawrence Thayer’s 
“Casey at the Bat,” which my 
father read to me when I was 
probably three or so, are incred-
ibly depressing.

Casey’s failure has become 

an unavoidable part of our cul-
ture. When he strikes out, we’ve 
become so invested it feels as 
though we ourselves have lost 
a hero. His irreversible mistake 
changes everything, stripping 
him of his identity and the 
people of his town of joy. We’re 
so willing to allow events to be 
representative of ourselves and 
our lives, which is why this story 
is so devastating — we either are 
or have been the disappointed 
citizens of Mudville.

Stories about baseball, like 

the 2011 novel “The Art of Field-
ing,” are also often subtly about 
the way we struggle and become 
ourselves. In Chad Harbach’s 
book, we meet Henry Skrim-
shander as a freshman at the 
fictional Westish College. For 
his entire life, Henry has been 
an almost magical, zero-error 
shortstop, defining himself 
through the game of baseball. 
But like “Casey at the Bat,” 
standing with the weight of the 

world on his shoulders, the crux 
of the story comes when Henry 
must learn how to deal with fail-
ure and disappointment. 

The rest of the characters’ 

lives in the novel also revolve 
around the world of baseball 
in the extremely small bubble 
of Westish College. Henry’s 
cultivated and confident room-
mate, Owen, has a preternatural 
understanding of the physical-
ity of the game. However, their 
gruff mentor, Schwartz, cannot 
match the ease of movement 
with which Owen and Henry 
play. The characters’ relation-
ship to the game is constantly 
reflected in their relationships 
and time outside of it. “The Art 
of Fielding” sees baseball and 
human existence as relatively 
analogous, like most litera-
ture that finds itself baseball-
inclined.

I was at a minor league base-

ball game in Maine this summer, 
cheering on the Portland Sea 
Dogs against the Hartford Yard 
Goats. Children dressed up as 
condiments and raced across 
the field — mustard won. The air 
smelled of French fries and fresh-
ly cut grass and I ate a hot dog 
wrapped conspicuously in Won-
der Bread. Looking at the men 
nonchalantly rounding the bases, 
I rudely announced to the group 
I was with that they weren’t 
even running that fast and that 
I could probably do that. I tuned 
out the announcer describing the 
local hardware store that had 
sponsored the game and thought 
about the poem “Baseball” by 
Linda Pasten.

“When you tried to tell me / 

baseball was a metaphor / for 
life: the long, dusty travail / 
around the bases, for instance, / 
to try to go home again...I didn’t 
believe you. / It’s just a way of 
passing / the time, I said. / And 
you said: that’s it. / Yes.”

LITERATURE COLUMN

FILM REVIEW

It’s no secret that Ira Sachs 

(“Love is Strange”) has a gift 
for emotional realism. Never 
has 
that 
been 

more 
apparent 

than in his lat-
est film, “Little 
Men,” which fol-
lows 
the 
bud-

ding 
friendship 

between 
Tony 

Calvelli 
(new-

comer Michael Barbieri) and 
Jake Jardine (newcomer Theo 
Taplitz). The two meet at Jake’s 
grandfather’s funeral — Tony’s 
mom owns the store beneath 
the grandfather’s apartment — 
and instantly become insepa-
rable.

The friendship is treated 

with a patience rarely seen in 
film. The young men are given 
plenty of screen time to just be 
together. Long shots of the two 
rollerblading, sitting, stand-
ing, walking and doing almost 
anything else thirteen-year-
old boys do in silence follow 
most scenes of dialogue. Those 
stretches of silence are perhaps 
the film’s strongest moments. 
Sachs shows what friendship 
looks like without letting the 
audience in on its secrets and 

specificities.

This gentle treatment of 

adolescence extends to all the 
children in the film. The kids 
in Tony and Jake’s acting class 
pulse with the same level of 

realism. 
In 
an 

especially lifelike 
(and very funny) 
moment, one of 
the 
girls 
tells 

Tony that she’s 
really “into older 
guys” 
when 
he 

asks her to dance. 

These small celebrations of the 
everyday are what make the 
film as realistic and powerful 
as it is.

The film misses out every 

moment that it chooses not to 
spend with its two young leads. 
The parallel plot of the squab-
ble between the Jardines and 
Leonor (Paulina García, “Glo-
ria”), Tony’s mother, is not only 
less compelling, it’s poorly exe-
cuted. Brian, Jake’s father, is 
played unconvincingly by resi-
dent indie dad Greg Kinnear 
(“Little Miss Sunshine”). He 
and Lenore (Paulina Garcia, 
“Narcos”) navigate a legal mess 
with a lack of passion that bor-
ders on boredom. This dryness 
is only made more apparent 
when compared to the pure 
vitality that threatens to break 

through the screen whenever 
either of their sons are on cam-
era.

As fate would have it, the two 

little men are not allowed to be 
best friends forever. Towards 
the end of the film, the parental 
subplot takes over. Rents and 
voices are raised, and Lenore 
must close up her shop. With-
out the common ground of the 
store, the boys drift away from 
each other. 

The boys’ breakup itself is 

raw and heartbreaking — never 
more so than when Jake tries to 
rollerblade back to Manhattan. 
But its power and poignancy 
is undercut by the slog of legal 
narrative required to reach that 
moment.

Keeping with the trend of 

Sachs’s other films, a gay sub-
text could be detected in Jake 
and 
Tony’s 
friendship. 
But 

keeping in the reality of the 
simultaneous 
sexuality 
and 

sexlessness of thirteen-year-
olds, the film decides to hint 
rather than commit — and it’s 
better for that choice. 

Characterized by the most 

realistic and poignant repre-
sentations of adolescence in 
recent history, Sachs’s film is a 
beautiful ode to the everyday. 
It’s just a shame “Little Men” 
isn’t only about its little men.

Defense learns from first-quarter test

Just after the No. 4 Michigan 

football team started to gain 
momentum off a blocked punt-
turned-touchdown 
to 
draw 

within a score of Colorado, 
redshirt junior linebacker Mike 
McCray jumped offside on the 
Buffaloes’ ensuing drive.

The penalty gave Colorado 

the first down it needed, and 
just under four minutes later, an 
efficient 67-yard, 10-play drive 
gave the Buffaloes a 21-7 lead to 
close out the first quarter.

In the season opener against 

Hawaii, McCray didn’t have 
any such miscues. In his first 
game after missing all of 2015 
due to injury, he recorded 
nine tackles, 3.5 for loss, two 
sacks and a forced fumble — 
garnering Big Ten Defensive 
Player of the Week honors. 
Though 
Saturday’s 
game 

against Colorado wasn’t perfect, 
McCray isn’t focused too much 
on his misstep.

“I don’t think I’m struggling 

— I just think I’m just out there 
trying to play hard and have 
fun,” McCray said Monday. “I 
don’t think about my mistakes 
during 
the 
game, 
because 

mistakes are going to happen, 
so we gotta keep playing and 
moving on to help the team.”

The Wolverines ultimately 

fought back to victory, and so 
did McCray, who collected five 
tackles and half a sack. After 
allowing three touchdowns, 
Michigan scored 17 unanswered 
points to take its first lead of 
the game.

McCray said that coming out 

of halftime, the message was 
to be patient. As a linebacker 
dealing with plenty of play-
action passes, he wanted to 
stop the running game first, 
which hurt the team. But 
after halftime, he felt like the 

linebackers adjusted well.

Going 
into 
the 
season, 

the linebackers heard a lot 
about how they would be the 
most inexperienced unit on 
Michigan’s 
defense. 
McCray 

and senior Ben Gedeon were 
the 
only 
two 
experienced 

linebackers to return in 2016, not 
counting redshirt sophomore 
Jabrill Peppers, who recently 
made the switch to the position. 
Though the rawness showed on 
Saturday, the unit also displayed 
its ability to bounce back.

“We didn’t get a lot of respect 

coming into the year, and I 
feel like we still don’t have 
the respect that we deserve,” 
McCray said. “I feel like we’re 
still in the process of getting 
that respect, but as a whole, I 
feel like we’ve gotten a lot better 

since spring ball.”

After 
the 
first-quarter 

ambush, defensive coordinator 
Don Brown, who is known 
for being fiery and spirited, 
managed 
to 

calm 
down 

not 
just 
the 

linebackers, but 
all of his players.

“He was real 

level-headed 
— 
he 
wasn’t 

being 
rowdy 

or 
anything,” 

McCray 
said. 

“He 
was 
just 

keeping 
us 

upbeat 
and 

confident, getting (us) ready 
to go back out there. I feel like 
that helped us a lot after the 
first quarter. It settled us down. 

‘We got this.’ I feel like we 
proved ourselves after facing 
adversity.”

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh also likes to watch 

the 
defensive 

fight, and said 
Monday that he 
likes to watch 
the players, even 
when he should 
be planning the 
next series.

The 
support 

from the head 
coach 
instills 

necessary 
confidence 
in 

players 
like 

McCray.

“I feel like (Harbaugh) trusts 

the defense a lot and talks about 
us in practice all the time, and I 

feel like he knows what we’re 
capable of,” McCray said. “I think 
he just wants to see us go out 
there and compete and have fun.”

The first-quarter test against 

Colorado 
proved 
to 
be 
an 

important 
learning 
moment 

for McCray and the rest of the 
defense. Now, heading into 
Michigan’s 
first 
conference 

matchup of the season, it has the 
experience it needs to deal with 
more efficient offenses.

“We weren’t thinking as 

much as we were in the first 
quarter,” McCray said. “I feel 
like we were thinking a lot — 
thinking too much, really — and 
I feel like we calmed down. We 
consider ourselves one of the 
best defenses in the country, 
and we wanted to go out and 
prove that.”

Redshirt junior linebacker Mike McCray, who had five tackles and a half-sack against Colorado, thought Michigan’s defense responded well to early mistakes.

Magnuson, Michigan offensive line go ‘piggin’

He wore a blue-collared shirt 

with his name on it, but Erik 
Magnuson wasn’t there to make 
metaphors 
about 
lunch-pail 

workmanship.

Instead, as Michigan’s fifth-

year senior tackle spoke to 
reporters in the Crisler Center 
media room Monday, Magnuson 
revealed another purpose for 
his attire.

“It’s 
my 
piggin’ 
shirt,” 

Magnuson explained. “Wear it 
when we go piggin’.”

A hulking right tackle with 

a beard that would make Paul 
Bunyan proud, Magnuson was 
initially hesitant to explain the 
meaning. But then he did anyway.

“Setting me up to be a 

headline on the other team,” he 
said. “So I can’t really say, but 
just understand, defensive line’s 
a bunch of pigs. Gotta get ’em.”

Against Colorado on Saturday, 

Magnuson did just that. He 
was Michigan’s highest-graded 
offensive lineman for the game, 
according 
to 
Pro 
Football 

Focus, and Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said “Mags” has 
probably been the team’s top 
pass protector so far.

He was named to the watch 

list for the Outland Trophy 
(awarded to the nation’s best 
interior lineman) this past 
summer, and he has lived up 
to it so far. Magnuson said 
Monday that he has not yet 
given up a sack, knocking on 
wood after he answered.

That’s 
an 
indication 
his 

early-season quest to fend off 
the “pigs” has been successful. 
Magnuson 
is 
no 
newcomer 

to animal metaphors — he 
compared Jabrill Peppers to 
a tiger last year — but for this 

one, he is sharing the credit 
with fellow fifth-year senior 
Kyle Kalis. Magnuson said he 
and Kalis, his former roommate, 
originated the term piggin’, and 
now others on the offensive line 
are in on it.

As early as Monday night, 

Magnuson proclaimed, the pair 
might release a web show called 
“Gone Piggin’ ” in the mold of 
Wayne’s World.

“There will be a show,” 

Magnuson said. “Whether or 
not it’s going to be available for 
you to see, yet to be determined.”

He declined to say where 

the studio would be, and he 
even declined to say whether 
it would even be released for 
public consumption “depending 
on 
how 
much 
criticism 

Coach thinks we’ll get for it.” 
Magnuson said they plan to 
have guests — senior tight end 
Jake Butt confirmed he had been 
invited on the show — and that 
they planned to film Monday. 

Late 
Monday 
evening, 
a 

photo 
including 
Magnuson 

and Kalis appeared on the 
Instagram page of the WOLV-
TV show Wolverine Women, 
announcing “Gone Piggin’ ” as 

a new weekly segment.

“It could be launching tonight, 

or tomorrow, or never,” Magnuson 
said Monday. “Stay tuned.”

But coming off a game in 

which 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight was 
sacked three times, Magnuson 
also knows he can’t rest on his 
piggin’ laurels.

“We 
can 
get 
better 
at 

piggin’,” 
Magnuson 
said. 

“Every week you can improve 
on your piggin’, but it depends 
on the attitude going into that. 
That’s why you’ve gotta wear 
the piggin’ shirt.”

Asked what the defensive line 

thought of the “pig” nicknames, 
Magnuson said it was a friendly 
nickname and that the defense 
had names for the offensive line, 
too. He did not specify what 
the names were, but perhaps 
redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Maurice Hurst gave a hint 
earlier in the afternoon.

As both Magnuson and Hurst 

sat at a podium, they were asked 
why offensive linemen were 
more prone to grow long beards 
than defensive linemen.

Hardly missing a beat, Hurst 

responded: “Uh, they’re ugly.”

Experienced, cohesive line looks to go after ‘pigs’ on defensive line, and has fun off the field, too

Fifth-year senior right tackle Erik Magnuson (78) said he has not allowed a sack all season but can still find ways to improve alongside right guard Kyle Kalis (67).

Abby Wambach visits 
Rackham Auditorium

Many know Abby Wambach 

for her success with the United 
States 
Women’s 
National 

Soccer Team. Almost 11 months 
after the star announced her 
retirement, a new, post-soccer 
Wambach 
visited 
Rackham 

Auditorium on Saturday night to 
discuss her life after retirement 
and her new memoir “Forward.” 

She 
discussed 
her 
book 

with Doug Tribou, the host for 
Morning Edition on Michigan 
Radio, and mentioned how the 
story not only highlights her 
successful career, but also casts 
a light on the darker times in 
her life.

At the event, sponsored by 

Literati Bookstore, Wambach 
discussed times during her 
childhood and growing up with 
six 
siblings. 

She 
said 
she 

searched 
for 

attention 
at 

home 
and 

didn’t 
receive 

it, so in order 
to satisfy her 
craving for the 
limelight, 
she 

became one of 
the 
greatest 

soccer 
players 

of all time.

Wambach didn’t always love 

being in the spotlight, though. 
She describes herself in two 
ways: as “intense Abby” and 
“chill Abby.” One part of her 
would love to compete, while 
the other didn’t necessarily 
have a passion for the game.

Unlike 
many 
athletes, 

Wambach didn’t know right 
away that playing soccer is 
what she wanted to do with 
her life. Growing up, she was 
never able to watch soccer on 
television and didn’t think her 

career was possible.

It wasn’t until she saw the 

U.S. win the World Cup in 1999 
that she knew being on the 
national team was something 
she had to do.

After playing in the 2008 

Olympics, Wambach became a 
household name, and with fame 
came more stress into her life.

In her memoir, Wambach 

doesn’t shy away from her 
struggles 
with 
alcohol 
and 

substance abuse. In fact, it is the 
highlight of her book.

She knew that she wouldn’t 

be able to tell her full story the 
way she wanted to if she wasn’t 
honest.

For Wambach, there was 

not a moment that sparked 
her realization that she had 
a problem. At first, it was her 
crumbling 
marriage 
due 
to 

her intense training and travel 

schedule. 
Then, 
it 
was 

her decreasing 
minutes on the 
soccer 
field. 

And 
finally, 

it 
was 
her 

impending 
retirement and 
the fear of what 
came next.

Her arrest for 

a DUI in April 

was her rock bottom.

Wambach 
described 
her 

feelings of shame and said she 
felt like a fraud.

It may have appeared on 

the soccer field that she had 
everything figured out, but 
that wasn’t the reality. She 
said writing “Forward” was 
therapeutic and has given her a 
chance to look ahead.

Even 
after 
all 
the 

championships and the records 
she 
has 
broken, 
she 
said, 

“Forward” may be the one thing 
she’s the most proud of.

Retired soccer star discusses new book, 
life after retirement, substance abuse

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Abby Wambach scored more goals in her career (184) than any player in soccer 
history. She recently released her new memoir, “Forward.”

Skjodt shows leadership, improvement

After a difficult first set in 

which the No. 23 Michigan 
volleyball team unexpectedly lost 
to Colgate, the Wolverines needed 
a big play to separate themselves 
from the Raiders. With the set 
tied at 18, sophomore libero Jenna 
Lerg served the ball. Players 
watched as it shot off her hand, 
and they began to hit back and 
forth until Colgate outside hitter 
Katie Stebbins jumped to spike 
the ball to the Wolverines’ side.

Senior middle blocker Abby 

Cole and sophomore outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt knew their 
task. The two players anchor 
Michigan’s offense, leading the 
team with enthusiasm from their 
positions in the front row.

Saturday 
night, 
the 
duo 

combined for a powerful block, 
giving the Wolverines a lead 

they would not relinquish en 
route to a set and eventual 3-1 
match victory over Colgate at 
Cliff Keen Arena.

Skjodt finished with seven 

kills, five digs and two block 
assists, despite leaving the final 
set due to a leg injury. In Friday 
night’s game against Auburn, she 
notched eight kills and nine digs. 
As a sophomore on a team with 
seven new freshmen, Skjodt has 
found herself in a leadership role.

“We had a huge freshman 

class, but as sophomores we still 
know the ‘Michigan way,’ ” Skjodt 
said. “(We tell the freshmen) 
what we’re supposed to do and 
help them through.”

With the help of her strength 

and conditioning coach Mike 
Favre, Skjodt spent the winter 
and spring terms in the weight 
room improving her physicality 
and strength. And it looks like 
her work is beginning to pay off. 

Skjodt averages 2.79 kills per 
game — 0.91 more than last year 
— and improved her attacking 
accuracy by .63.

Her coach and teammates have 

noticed her efforts. Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen emphasized 
her tremendous physicality and 
versatility on the floor, while 
Cole detailed Skjodt’s passion for 
competition. After their dynamic 
block, the duo high-fived and 
embraced their teammates.

“She’s touching higher. (She is) 

more physical with everything 
she does, and she’s hitting the 
ball harder so it’s allowing her 
to compete in those situations,” 
Rosen said. “One of the things 
we look for in her on the court is 
her full game. She’s a six-rotation, 
five-skill-set type player who can 
do everything.”

Added Cole: “(What stands 

out is) her ability to compete . . . 
she’s coming in and competing 

her hardest every single match. 
She’s just doing a very good job of 
competing and I think that’s an 
edge that we haven’t always had 
on our team.”

Though 
Skjodt 
is 
just 
a 

sophomore, she has asserted her 
status as a veteran teammate 
throughout 
Michigan’s 
non-

conference schedule. Even from 
the sideline, she could be seen 
yelling words of encouragement 
and giving high-fives as players 
returned to the bench.

Heading into Big Ten play — a 

conference that both Cole and 
Rosen termed the most difficult 
in the country — the Wolverines 
will look to Skjodt to help mentor 
the younger players through 
vocal leadership during games.

And if she continues this 

guidance 
and 
continues 
her 

physical presence at the net, it 
bodes well for Michigan’s future 
this season.

Sophomore outside hitter Carly Skjodt now ranks second on the Wolverines behind Abby Cole with 106 kills this season.

Diverse attack leads 
Michigan in easy win

When sophomore forward 

Marleise Emrhein scored her 
second goal Sunday for the 
Michigan field hockey team, 
it didn’t change much in terms 
of the game. The Wolverines 
were 
already 
up 
9-0 
on 

Central Michigan with less 
than 10 minutes remaining, 
and the outcome had long 
been decided.

But the goal came from an 

unusual scorer, one of many 
contributions 
from 
bench 

players Sunday.

Six different players scored 

for Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 6-1 
overall), and all 
22 on the roster 
saw 
playing 

time 
against 

the Chippewas. 
And with tough 
matchups 
approaching 
this 
weekend 

against 
Ohio 

State and No. 4 
Penn State, that 
kind of spread 
out attack is 
exactly what the Wolverines 
were looking for.

“We need everybody’s fresh 

legs,” said Michigan head 
coach Marcia Pankratz. “So 
getting experience and having 
people play in positions that 
we’re going to need this 
weekend was good practice 
for them.”

The bench players did more 

than just relieve tired legs, 
though. In the midst of one of 
the toughest stretches of their 
schedule, the Wolverines were 
given a confidence boost that 
could prove valuable in the 
long run.

“It’s actually really fun when 

the goals keep coming back 

and back,” said senior forward 
Courtney Enge. “We get more 
hype, and we know what the job 
is — we know that we need to 
stay cool and composed. But once 
we get more goals, it’s like we feel 
more comfortable and we have 
more confidence on the field.”

Added 
junior 
midfielder 

Katie Trombetta: “Being able 
to see everyone get thrown 
into these positions and keep 
the level of intensity and the 
style of play that we started 
with — no matter who’s in, the 
level is still the same.”

The 10 goals on Sunday were 

the most scored in a game 
by Michigan since 2013, and 
it came thanks to a diverse 

scoring output. 
Along 
with 

Emrhein’s 
offensive 
outburst, 
freshman 
midfielder Meg 
Dowthwaite 
earned her first 
career 
goal, 

while freshman 
goalkeeper 
Claire Stemper 
was 
called 

upon to preserve the shutout at 
the end of the game. 

But even with the positive 

results the Wolverines enjoyed 
this weekend, the team knows 
the road gets harder from here.

“Obviously, winning 10-0, 

it’s a fun game,” Pankratz said. 
“But we still have to focus on 
the things that will make us 
better for the next match. So 
that was kind of the focus.”

Still, the experience gained 

by Michigan’s depth player’s 
left the team with a good 
feeling in the end. And if 
nothing else, that confidence 
has the Wolverines feeling 
poised to take on the next 
portion of their schedule.

‘M’ can’t capitalize on 
shot advantage at MSU

EAST LANSING —If soccer 

games were decided by shots 
instead of goals, the Michigan 
men’s soccer team would be 6-1 
this season.

But 
they 
are 
not, 
and 

instead, the Wolverines are 
still searching for their first 
win. Sunday, Michigan (0-3-
0 Big Ten, 0-4-3 overall) once 
again outshot its opponent, by 
a margin of 16-10, but still fell to 
Michigan State (2-0 Big Ten, 5-1 
overall), 1-0. A goal in the eighth 
minute by Spartan defender 
Brad Centala proved decisive.

“(Soccer) is a game of inches 

and margins,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “We had 
four or five chances down there 
and the goal is cursed. That’s 
college soccer.”

In the first half, Wolverine 

freshman 
forward 
Jack 

Hallahan created the majority 
of Michigan’s scoring chances.

In the 14th minute, Hallahan 

found senior defender Rylee 
Woods, but Woods’ shot went 
high. Later, Hallahan found 
redshirt 
junior 
midfielder 

Michael Kapitula in the 38th 
minute but was blocked by a 
Spartan 
defender. 
Hallahan 

tallied three shots for the day.

“We’re able to get in and 

around the opponents’ net,” 
said senior midfielder Brett 
Nason. “It shows that we’re 
looking to score. Some games, 
unfortunately, we’ve not scored. 
The only way you can score is by 
shooting. A lot of shots is not a 
bad thing for sure.”

Sophomore midfielder Robbie 

Mertz also threatened to cause 
problems for Michigan State.

With less than one minute 

before halftime, Mertz got 
his head on a cross from 
Kapitula in an attempt to 
walk into intermission tied 
at 
one. 
Unfortunately 
for 

Michigan, Spartan goaltender 
Jimmy Hague was perfectly 
positioned to intercept the 

header and preserve his team’s 
1-0 advantage.

Mertz did not have to wait 

long into the second half for 
his next opportunity. Three 
minutes 
after 
intermission, 

Mertz 
came 
up 
with 
an 

interswinging 
service 
from 

the left that found Kapitula. 
Once again, Hague successfully 
defended it and the Wolverines 
remained scoreless.

Michigan was largely devoid 

of shots after that until the 75th 
minute when Mertz kicked the 
ball from the left side to Hague. 
The Wolverines got a better 
chance three minutes later 
when Mertz earned a corner 
kick, but they were unable to 
capitalize on it. Mertz finished 
Sunday with four shots.

“We’re young in a lot of 

places,” Daley said. “We’re 
youthful in a lot of ways, but it 
still doesn’t excuse what I think 
was a missed opportunity with 
the quality of chances we had.”

Sophomore 
midfielder 

Francis Atuahene — who was 
Michigan’s lead scorer last 
season — saw his first scoring 
opportunity in the 81st minute 
when he made a toe poke shot 
that was caught by Hague.

Senior 
defender 
Lars 

Eckenrode 
was 
nearly 
the 

Wolverines’ hero, but his volley 
with 1:20 remaining in the game 
went just above the goal.

For 
Michigan, 
the 
task 

moving 
forward 
will 

undoubtedly be turning its shot 
advantage into a goal advantage.

“We 
just 
need 
to 
fight 

harder,” Nason said. “There 
were a couple of shots late in the 
second half where the ball hit 
the crossbar and the ball was 
just bouncing in front of the 
net. Just fight harder, be in the 
right spot at the right time. Just 
keep to the game plan and on 
forward from there.”

The Wolverines will get a 

quick opportunity to capitalize 
on their shots when they return 
home to face Western Michigan 
on Wednesday.
