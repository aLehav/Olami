Lecturers' union
claims move was
'union retaliation'
by 'U' officials
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
University lecturers rallied
Friday afternoon to protest the
non-reappointment of one of the
Lecturers Employment Organi-
zation's top officials, a move some
lecturers are calling retaliation
against the union.
The group of about 30 lec-
turers, dressed to yellow LEO
T-shirts,
gathered
in Angell
Hall before
marching
from the Eng-
lish Depart-
ment's offices -
in Angell Hall KYLE SWANSON
to LSA Dean
Terrence Covering the
McDonald's A dmnisfration
office in the
LSA Administration Building.
The protest continued with mem-
bers ending their rally on the
third floor of the Fleming Admin-
istration Building just outside
Provost Teresa Sullivan's office.

LEO members say the decision
by University officials to not reap-
point Kirsten Herold, who has
worked as a lecturer in the Uni-
versity's English Department for
18 years and serves as the union's
vice president, is the latest of
several incidents that highlight
problematic review procedures
in place for lecturers at the Uni-
versity.
Union officials also say the
University's decision could have a
significant impact on the ongoing
contract negotiations between
LEO and the University.
Herold was going through a
remediation process with the
University when she received
notice on Wednesday that she
would not be allowed to return to
the University's English Depart-
ment after the end of this semes-
ter.
Remediation is a process in
which a lecturer's performance
is reviewed and a plan is devel-
oped to address any deficiencies
or concerns that are raised. After
the remediation plan is devel-
oped, the lecturer is given time to
implement the plan to adequately
address any concerns.
The plan's implementation and
the lecturer's progress is then
measuredby department officials
to see whether satisfactory prog-
ress was made. After review, the

Several fires started
early Saturday
morning outside
student residences
By JILLIAN BERMAN
and DYLAN CINTI
ManagingNewsEditor and
and Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor fire and police
departments are currently inves-
tigating a series of suspicious fires
that occurred at residences near

campus on Saturday.
In response to the fires, which
included a blaze in a rental house
on State
Street and First reported on
a fire under MihianDdyrcm
The Abbey
apartment building on Church
Street, the Department of Public
Safety sent out a crime alert to
the University community Satur-
day evening, alerting community
members of the fires and warning
them to take precautions.
"The fires all began outside
apartment houses at different
times (Saturday)," the crime alert

states. "One fire resulted in one
death and other significant inju-
ries."
Though officials are still inves-
tigating the cause of one of the
fires - an early morning blaze
that gutted a rental house on 928
S. State St. killing one and injur-
ing two others - officials suspect
the fire may have begun after an
upholstered couch caught fire on
the house's porch.
According to a press release
distributed by the Ann Arbor
Police Department on Saturday,
the State Street fire was reported
to have started on the porch at

about 5:15 a.m. before it spread to
the rest of the house.
Three residents wre sent to
the University Hospital. One of
the residents, former Eastern
Michigan University student Ren-
den LeMasters, died on Saturday.
LeMasters was 22 years old.
Of the two other hospitalized
residents, Department of Public
Safety spokeswoman Brown said
one is a University student who
was treated and released Satur-
day, and the other is a woman
unaffiliated with the University.
The woman remains in critical

In midterm elections, term
limits could cause shake-up


Experts say Mich.'s
term limits are
some of the most
restrictive in U.S.
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
Daily StaffReporter
Term limits in the Michigan
state legislature are some of the
i most restrictive of any state in the

country, which will make for huge
change due to the high turnover of
representatives followingmidterm
elections in November.
In interviews with The Michi-
gan Daily last week, experts on the
issue said though term limits are
detrimental to the efficiency of the
Michigan state government, elimi-
natingthemis not a feasible option.
While term limits are meant to
motivate politicians to act with
a sense of urgency during their
brief positions, some experts say

the limits - six years in the state
House of Representatives and
eight years in the state Senate -
don't give those in Lansing time
to gain experience in the legisla-
ture. This makes it more difficult
for government officials to solve
problems like budget deficits and
tax codes.
Prior to 1992, the Michigan
legislature had no term limits for
representatives. The state con-
stitution was amended in 1992 to

By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Rain showers didn't deter the
crowd of thousands of University
students and Ann Arbor locals
- sporting tie-dye and cannabis
T-shirts - from taking to the Diag
for the 39th annual Hash Bash on
Saturday.

In addition to live music, street
vendors and civil disobedience,
the festival provides a forum for
discussion of marijuana-related
issues.
Each year, organizations lobby-
ing for marijuana support adjust
their Hash Bash agendas based on
current events surrounding the
issue.
LSA sophomore Emily Basham,
a member of Students for Sensible
Drug Policy, said throughout this
school year SSDP focused on edu-
cating people about the 2008 ballot
initiative, which legalized medici-

nal marijuana use in the state of
Michigan.
"Last year we were campaign-
ing for Proposal 1," Basham said.
"This year we're trying to facili-
tate a discussion about medical
marijuana."
Basham said Hash Bash attend-
ees are more receptive to the
group's message than participants
at other public forums.
"We know there is an audience
here that's interested in the things
we have to say," she said.
Basham said Hash Bash is an

On Sat., students
volunteered with
schools, churches,

By MELISSA MARCUS
Daily StaffReporter
Hundreds of students demol-
ished abandoned homes, cleaned
parks and painted murals for the
University's 11th annual Detroit

Partnership Day on Saturday.
The Detroit Partnership - a
service learning organization -
partners Universitystudents with
Detroit schools, churches and
community groups in an effort to
give back to Detroit and help stu-
dents learn more about the city.
During DP Day, participants
volunteered at 30 different sites
in northwest and southwest
Detroit from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
This year, DP Day had the largest
attendance in the past 10 years,
with nearly 1,000 students par-

ticipating. Last year, 800 students
participated in the volunteer day.
Prior to the event, DP leaders
met with officials from Detroit
to decide which sites were in
need of the most help. Business
senior Neil Thanedar, the execu-
tive director of DP, said DP has
an active role in bettering Detroit
and creating a strong partnership
between the city and University
students.

Pot promoted as alcohol alternative

Last Thursday was the first
day of National Alcohol Aware-
ness Month, and to mark the
occasion, students on more
than 80 college campuses
across the country rallied last
week to support marijuana
as an alternative to alcohol,
according to an April 1 article
in The Chronicle of Higher
Education.
Safer Alternative for Enjoy-
able Recreation - a national
non-profit organization devot-
ed to educating people on the
relative safety of marijuana
versus alcohol - organized the
"Nationwide Day of Action" to
promote marijuana as a safer
alternative to alcohol.
According to the Chronicle,
students who took part in the
rallies asked their college presi-
dents to sign the Emerald Ini-
tiative - a document promising

While 135 college presidents
have signed the Amethyst Ini-

none signed the Emerald Initia-

the Chronicle reported.
LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL
RAISES GPA'S
At Loyola Law School at Los
Angeles, all current students
and alumni who graduated
as early as 2007 are about to
get boosts in their grade point
averages, according to an April
1 article in The Chronicle of
Higher Education.
The law school - ranked
seventh out of20 California law
schools approved by the Ameri-
can Bar Association - is adjust-
ing its grading system to reflect
more accurately the academic

quality of its students, the arti-
cle reported. Those who are
affected by the change will see
their GPAs increase one-third
of a point. This will cause letter
grades to rise, turning a B into a
B+ and a B+ into an A-.
Loyola Law School Dean
Victor Gold said in the article
that the boost will help the
school's students as they enter
a competitive job market.
"We concluded that the
grading. curve was sending
incorrect information about
our students," Gold said in the
article. "And, frankly, it was
putting them at an unfair com-
petitive disadvantage ina pret-
ty tough job market."
NAACP SUES STATE OF
GEORGIA
The NAACP has filed a law-
suit againstthe state of Georgia,

claiming that the state "system-
atically" under funds Georgia's
three black public universi-
ties - Albany State University,
Fort Valley State University and
Savannah State University -
according to an April 2 report
by The Associated Press.
Accordingtothe AP,the law-
suit wasbased on a 2008 report
by The Legal Defense Coalition
for the Preservation of Public
Historically Black Colleges and
Universities. The report claims
that the state violates the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the 14th
Amendment by not providing
adequate funding for the state's
three black colleges.
According to the article, the
report asserts that discrimina-
tion by university administra-
tors resulted in the three schools
having "second-class status" and
"de facto segregation."

SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich.
LSSU, MSU open
preferred medical
school admissions
Lake Superior State University
and Michigan State University have
announced an early medical school
acceptance program for certain
undergraduates.
The program provides assured
admission next year for one junior
undergraduate at the Sault Ste.
Marie campus into the College
of Human Medicine at Michigan
State.
The program gives preference
to students who express interest
in a high-need medical specialty or
location.
Similar programs operate
between Michigan State and the
University of Michigan-Flint and
Northern Michigan, Michigan
Technological and Grand Valley
State universities.
WASHINGTON
D.C. church draws
Obamas for Easter
President Barack Obama and his
family marked the Easter holiday
by attending a music-filled service
at a historically black Methodist
church in southeast Washington.
A boisterous crowd of more than
1,000 people welcomed the Obamas
yesterday at the Allen Chapel AME
Church. Joining him at the service
were his wife, Michelle, daughters
Sasha and Malia, and his mother-
in-law, Marian Robinson. Also
attending were the mayor of Wash-
ington, Adrian Fenty, and his wife.
"Mr. President, you have no idea
how much your presence has meant
to us today," Allen Chapel's senior
pastor, the Rev. Michael Bell, said
after his sermon.
Southeast Washington was
rocked last week by a drive-by
shooting that left four dead and five
others wounded. The area is also
beset by high unemployment and
poverty.
Bell said it was providence that
the president would attend service
at Allen Chapel so shortly after
the shootings. It was heartening
to know than southeast Wahing-
ton has not been forgotten, he said,
adding that Obama's presence at
the rh was "bringing healing
and hope into this community right
now."
XIANGNING, China
Nine rescued after
179 hours in mine
Nine miners were pulled to safety
early today after spending more than
a week trapped in a flooded coal mine
in northern China, a rescue that had
seemed beyond hope for days before
crews heard someone tapping from
deep underground.
The first survivor was brought to
the surface at 40 minutes past mid-
night Monday, 179 hours after the
Wangjialing mine filled with water.
A crowd of rescue workers, miners
and security workers outside the
entrance of the mine shaft clapped
as the miners were carried out.

The nine men were among 153
trapped since March 28 when
workers broke a wall into a water-
filled abandoned shaft. China Cen-
tral Television said more miners
could still be alive, but did not give
any details.
BANGKOK
Thai protesters
pledge to leave
malls and hotels
Thailand's capital, unnerved
by nearly four weeks of turmoil,
braced for renewed anti-govern-
ment demonstrations today as
protesters announced they would
shift to a new location after par-
alyzing Bangkok's commercial
heart over the weekend.
The weekend protests forced
the closure of at least six upscale
shopping malls and tough secu-
rity measures at nearby five-star
hotels, with economic losses esti-
mated at up to 500 million baht
($15 million) a day.
Prime Minister Abhisit Vej-
jajiva has repeatedly refused
demands of the so-called Red
Shirts that he immediately dis-
solve Parliament and call new
elections, despite protracted pro-
tests in the capital and unsuccess-
ful negotiations last week.
The protesters, mostly farm-
ers from impoverished provincial
areas, have vowed not to let up
their pressure until Abhisit's gov-
ernment steps down.

demolishing abandoned homes

with other DP members to plan

TERM LIMITS
From Page 1A
introduce term limits in an effort
to bring new people and ideas to
government.
The amendment followed a
trend which began with the 1947
establishment of a two-term limit
on the United States presidency.
Since then, controversy over
the effectiveness of term limits
has ensued. Several attempts to
lengthen or remove the limits in
the Michigan legislature entirely
have been made but none have
gained enough momentum to be
implemented.
Communication Studies Prof.
Michael Traugott said term limits
were introduced because the
public believed they were rea-
sonable checks on legislators'
power.
However, Traugott said vot-
ers today have different views
on term limits, adding that the
conflict is between "popular
attitudes about too much gov-
ernment influence in our daily
lives" and "a public policy-
making perspective that says
that length of service builds
expertise."
Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thomp-
son, a public policy professor
at Wayne State University,
researches the effects of term
limits on the Michigan state
legislature. Though some of her
research shows that shorter
term limits can be an effective
way to increase the number of
bills passed in a given congres-

sional cycle, she said the bills
tend to be "somewhat ill-con-
ceived legislation or somewhat
trivial legislation."
Sarbaugh-Thompson said
legislation passed simply for
the purpose of increasing pro-
ductivity has created propos-
als for the naming of a "state
cookie" and "state amphibian"
but has failed to address more
important matters, like the
structural budget deficit under
which the state operates.
Sarbaugh-Thompson said
though she acknowledges that
getting rid of term limits is not
politically realistic, she would
be in favor of eliminating them
altogether. She said a good fix
for now is simply to lengthen
the term limits, which would
allow state legislators to devel-
op legislative skills.
John Chamberlin, a profes-
sor at the Ford School of Public
Policy, agreed that increasing
the term limits is the best
approach for now. To further
shorten term limits, he said,
would be detrimental.
"If you had them shorter

questions.
"We have a lot of senior citizens
who are interested, but (usually)
afraid to ask about it," Ferris said.
"They'll come and buy the maga-
zine instead,"
Ypsilanti resident Katie Man-
sfield said Hash Bash is "the
most wonderful time of the year"
because it fosters an atmosphere
free of judgment.
"You can talk to different
people and mix in ways that you
would not be able to mix in other
social situations," Mansfield said.
Mansfield also said she thinks
the social atmosphere is a lot
calmer and less controversial than
city are truly amazing."
Public Policy junior Jenya
Abramovich was a site leader at
this year's DP Day. Abramov-
ich's group helped a family clean
an empty lot in preparation for
turning it into an urban gar-
den. Abramovich said while her
group was removing trash, some
of the neighbors began picking
up trash from their own lawns.
"We inspired others on the
block to clean up their street,"
Abramovich said. "This kind of
work is very satisfying because
I know that even after we leave
Detroit, the community is going
to continue those efforts because
they are invested in this effort to
bring progress to the neighbor-
hood."
Though DP day is the most
visible part of the the program,
Thanedar said DP is part of a
larger mission to benefit the city
than Michigan does at this point,
it would really be an amateur
hour in the legislature," Cham-
berlin said. "Nobody would have
experience running committees,
subcommittees, putting together
party caucuses and all."
Though Michigan has shorter
term limits than most states in the
country, other states also impose
term limits on their legislators.
According to Sarbaugh-Thomp-
son, 21 states initially instituted
term limits, though five of those
states have since repealed them.
Sarbaugh-Thompson said in
order to change term limits, either
the Michigan legislature has to
propose a bill and send it to Michi-
gan citizens or citizens have to
vote on a ballot initiative. Because

other public events and ultimately
allows people to reconsider their
opinions about marijuana users.
"It proves that all the stereo-
types about stoners are not true,"
she said. "We may not be the
most energetic group, but that's
OK because nobody is fighting or
arguing."
LSA freshman Alex Zick said
regardless of people's differing
opinions about Hash Bash, the
event draws crowds that boost
business for Ann Arbor restau-
rants.
"You can't deny it's good for

of Detroit.
Throughout the school year,
about 150 University students
travel to Detroit each week to
provide tutoring and mentoring
services for underprivileged stu-
dents in 20 Detroit schools. The
DP also provides GED training,
programs that teach English as
a second language and resume
building workshops to help
young adults in the work force.
Thanedar said DP partici-
pants who volunteer weekly in
Detroit schools are able to learn
about the city as a whole, adding
that the educational experience
is just as important as the actual
cleaning of the city.
"I really hope everyone who
volunteered would consider
Detroit not just as a place that
needs help but a vibrant place of
life that is worth investing in,"
Thanedar said.
a change in term limits would
amend the state constitution, citi-
zens would have to vote for the
change, Sarbaugh-Thompson said.
Despite the negative effects
term limits have had on the leg-
islature, Chamberlin pointed out
that other states with term limits
have had worse experiences. He
cited the New York state legis-
lature, which has more to worry
about than term limits.
"I don't think that the Michi-
gan legislature is deeply corrupt;
they're just not very competent at
this point," Chamberlin said. "You
could have legislatures that aren't
very competent and they're cor-
rupt, and New York's got those. I
think their problems are worse
than ours."

White House
takes credit
for reversing
poor economy

Despite new jobs
data, Obama admin.
braces Americans
for slow recovery
WASHINGTON (AP) - Buoyed
by good news on the jobs front, the
White House claimed credit Sun-
day for reversing the downward
economic spiral while bracing
out-of-work Americans for a slow
recovery.
The Obama administration also
eased away from confrontation
with China over its artificially
low currency. The U.S. wants to
encourage Beijing's help on nucle-
ar proliferation and new penal-
ties against Iran for its perceived
attempts to build a bomb.
Given the depth and length of
the recession, the White House
wants to cool expectations of a
rapid economic recovery before
the November elections that will
determine whether Democrats
retain control of the House and
Senate.
The administration's line is that
there's steady, if slow, progress in
repairing the economic ruin Presi-
dent Barack Obama repeatedly
blames on his predecessor, Repub-
lican George W. Bush.
The economy added about
162,000 jobs in March, the most
in nearly three years. A large per-
centage of the gains were tem-
porary census workers hired by
the federal government, and the
unemployment rate held firm at
9.7 percent. The additional 123,000
private-sector jobs were the most

since May 2007.
The economy is growing again,
but at a pace unlikely to quickly
replace the 8.4 million jobs erased
in the recession that began in late
2007. More than 11 million people
are drawing unemployment insur-
ance benefits.
"We've got a long way to go,"
said Lawrence Summers, director
of the National Economic Council.
"We've inherited a terrible situa-
tion, the most pressing economic
problems since the Great Depres-
sion in our country."
Christina Romer, head of the
White House Council of Econom-
ic Advisers, said consumers still
face "a lot of head winds" from the
financial crisis. For example, debt
and credit difficulties are hamper-
ing stronger job growth.
They were echoing the words
of Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, who said last week the
administration was "very wor-
ried" about returning to a more
normal jobless rate of around 5
percent.
Summers said Obama was pre-
occupied with creating jobs. "The
trend has turned, but to get back to
the surface, we've got a long way to
go," Summers said.
As Obama moves on with his
legislative agenda after victory
on health care, Summers said he
believed Congress would pass new
oversight rules for the financial
industry. The Wall Street melt-
down was largely blamed for the
recession and the near collapse of
the global financial system.
"I expect that reform is going to
pass," Summers said. Obama wants
it on his desk within two weeks.

Census countdown
Students must complete census survey to help city
A pril Fool's Day is usually a day devoted to practical jokes,
but this year the date took on a new meaning. The U.S.
Census Bureau declared Apr. 1, 2010 to be National Cen-
sus Day to remind people to fill out and send in their census
survey. Response rates for students have been unimpressive in
the past. But students can change that by taking 10 minutes to
complete a census form. In the past few months, the University
has taken several measures in an effort to raise awareness and
increase this year's response rate. With forms now delivered to
both residential halls and off-campus houses, students need to
do their part.


(Agri)cultural cele

As the Daily reported earlier this semes-
ter, many communities in Ann Arbor had
an extremely low response rate to the 2000
census. To combat the low turnout, the
University held a video campaign that was
intended to improve understanding of the
census. Afterviewing13 submissions, awin-
ner was announced last week. The shorter
form of the census for students living in
residence halls was delivered last week as
well. Ifa student fails to send in their form
by thatdate, census officials will be visiting
their room to obtain the information.
Unless students have been living under
a rock for the last few months, they should
know that they need to fill out the census.
Months of hearing and reading about the
census should have informed student of
its important purpose. The census deter-
mines how much funding the federal gov-
ernment allocates to local governments.
This funding could be spent on projects
like improving roads and infrastructure.
And national ad campaigns in addition to
University reminders have left students
without the excuse that they simply didn't
know they were supposed to.

And filling out the census isn't only a
civil responsibility. It's a legal responsi-
bility, too. Every person in the country is
required by law to complete the census.
If an individual fails to complete the cen-
sus, they can be fined from $100 to $5,000.
And students don't get a free pass simply
because they aren't permanent Ann Arbor
residents. Everyone in the country must fill
out a census where they reside most of the
year - for students, that's Ann Arbor. It's a
legal obligation to respond to the census in
Ann Arbor. They shouldn't put it off.
The U.S. Census Bureau is also using a
shorter version of the form than it has in
years past. With only 10 questions on the
form - and even fewer for those living in
residence halls - there is no excuse for not
filling it out. The Census Bureau has made
the census quick and painless. Now stu-
dents need to do their part to make sure this
important and simple task is completed.
Filling out a census is an easy way to help
Ann Arbor - and it's students'responsibil-
ity to do it. So break out a blue or black pen
and take 10 short minutes to fill out the
census form.

A s a country girl, I'm a big fan
of fairs. I like the horse shows,
rides and concerts. I have a
special affection
for funnel cake. I
have fond memo-
ries of working at
the FFA's (formerly r
the Future Farmers
of America) Circle ,
of Life exhibit, '
which showcased
chicks, calves and
other baby ani- RACHEL
mals, at the Ing- VANGLDER
ham County Fair
in Mason, Michi-
gan. The Webber-
ville Chapter of the FFA even made
the trip to the Michigan State Fair in
Detroit once to man a small exhibit for
the Farm Bureau. The State Fair was
large, loud and it smelled of hotdogs
and cherry slushies.
But the Michigan State Fair, which
has existed for about 160 years, prob-
ably won't be back this summer. The
fair lost state support last year and
plans to lease the land to other orga-
nizations have stalled. With all the
delays, it seems as though the State
Fair won't take place this year. But
the state fair is a valuable cultural
exhibition, and the more time that
passes without progress, the less like-
ly it seems that the fair will ever take
place again. But if Michigan agricul-
tural organizations band together,
they could save the State Fair.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm cut state
funding to the fair last year in an
attempt to save the government
money. On one level, I can't fault her
for making cuts. Michigan's project-
ed deficit for the 2011 fiscal year is
an astonishing $1.8 billion. And I'm
not even that ticked that she chose
the State Fair to get the ax. That's
because I think that the State Fair
could get funding from other sources
with relatively little trouble.

The Huron-Clinton Metropoli-
tan Authority has said that it would
be interested in acquiring 120 acres
of the fairgrounds, according to a
report on Saturday by The Detroit
Free Press. The Authority would
turn some of the grounds into a year-
round park and run the fair in the
summer. But, according to a report
by The Detroit News on Saturday,
the Authority must submit a proposal
for use of the land to the state by the
end of April to obtain the land. The
clock's ticking. And the Authority
has already said that it doesn't think
the State Fair will make it off the
ground this year. But the longer the
wait before the Authority submits its
plans, the more I worry that the Fair
will never happen again. And I don't
think that's okay.
Michigan residents often forget
that agriculture is the state's second
largest industry. Though Michigan
is home to several densely-populated
areas like Lansing and Detroit, much
of the state is actually rural. And it
makes millions of dollars each year
producing dairy products, cherries,
blueberries, asparagus and pickling
cucumbers. According to the U.S.
Department .of Agriculture's 2007
Census of Agriculture, Michigan
farms employ 86,000 people and pay
out $607 million to workers. And
even though students here at the Uni-
versity of Michigan love to mock it,
Michigan State University's College
of Agriculture actually makes a lot of
sense in a state that depends so heav-
ily on agriculture.
The State Fair is a venue to show-
case that part of Michigan's culture.
Of course, fairs are also the best place
to eat too much junk food and ride
the tilt-a-whirl until you get nau-
seous. But the State fair gives people
who aren't familiar with Michigan's
agriculture industry an opportunity
to see award-winning cows and pigs
and check out exhibits by Michigan

bration
growers. It's a learning opportunity
and a place for Michigan farmers
to show what they do for this state.
The Huron-Clinton Metropolitan
Authority should work with Michi-
gan agricultural organizations to
revive plans for a state fair.
The Michigan
State Fair isn't just
about funnel cake.
If a group of agricultural sponsors
worked together to fund the State
Fair this year, they could have a place
to show their wares and get some
advertising in, too. The Michigan
Department of Agriculture's website
lists a host of organizations ranging
from the Michigan Farm Bureau to
the Holstein Association to the Sod
Growers of Michigan. Any of these
groups could contribute to sponsor-
ship of the fair. The Huron-Clinton
Metropolitan Authority should look
into finding sponsors from organiza-
tions like this to make sure that the
fair happens next year.
Because most of Michigan's county
fairs don't appear to be in danger of
closing before they open, I'm prob-
ably still going to get my funnel cake
this summer. And my mother will
probably enter some cherry jam and
pickled asparagus in a fair some-
where. But the State Fair was a cel-
ebration of the industry that keeps
so many Michigan families fed. And
agricultural organizations should
work together to keep that celebra-
tion alive.

"What can you learn in Detroit that you can't
learn in Ann Arbor?" asked a friend when I told
him that I would be spending this semester in the
city as part of the second year of the Semester in
Detroit program. I wasn't exactly sure, beyond
feeling there must be something to gain from liv-
ing outside of Ann Arbor, which I've called home
for 20 years. My academic and personal pursuits
have been largely centered on social justice, par-
ticularly environmental justice, and I wanted to
see hose the academic theories I'd studied trans-
late into work outside of an academic setting.
In Detroit, I've had the opportunity to work
with and hear from community members who
have spent their lives dealing with issues I have
only really known from within the confines of
the classroom. Even more valuable than any spe-
cific knowledge I've gained is what I've learned
about the complexity of the city. Through my
work at a non-profit in southwest Detroit, the
courses about Detroit history and events I've
attended and talking with Wayne State and Uni-
versity of Michigan students, I've been nearly
constantly surrounded by discussions of the city
- past, present and future.
one issue at the forefront of many Detroi-
ters' minds is the concept of "right-sizing" the
city, the focus of a recent Daily editorial (Stimu-
late blight control, 03/28/2010). The editorial
promoted Mayor Dave Bing's plan to demolish
abandoned homes and "rezone the city into
denser communities to distribute funds more
effectively." The importance of blight eradi-
cation is certainly not news to Detroiters, and
it's the most prevalent issue I've worked on
through my internship.
Two weeks ago, I attended the mayor's State
of the City address. The only aspect of the right-
sizing plan that Bing laid out explicitly was the
plan to demolish 3,000 abandoned buildings by
the end of the year. These demolitions are long
overdue. But the logistics of the plan at large
remain unknown. What will be done with vacant
lots after demolition is still a topic of great con-
cern for many Detroiters. The even more conten-
tious aspect of the right-sizing concept that I've
heard among some community members is the
question of how the city will go about making
communities "denser".
Eventually, right-sizing will likely involve
moving residents from their homes in sparsely
populated neighborhoods to denser residential
areas. The purported need to rezone the city

into "denser communities" seems easy enough
to understand in terms of the city's economy
and population loss.
But this will not be the first time in Detroit's
history that people have been moved for the sake
of "blight removal." The city's postwar urban
renewal program involved the destruction of
black and low-income neighborhoods by build-
ing freeways through them or leveling them all
together, which led to disastrous effects on the
city's housing. The social and economic climate
during the failed urban renewal efforts of the
post-war era was certainly different than today
in many ways and it's not my intention to equate
the two situations. But recognizing Detroit's
history in this policy area reveals why many
Detroiters are wary of the current right-sizing
discussion and why one lifelong Detroiter I met
recently told me he thinks that the plan is "evil".
The fact that the exact plan is still unknown
leaves even more room for speculation and criti-
cism. Still, studying Detroit's history and dis-
cussing it with city residents has allowed me to
understand why a plan that might seem fairly
uncontroversial at firstis actually complex. I have
heard many Detroiters ask fundamental ques-
tions that have remained largely unanswered
thus far. Do people want to leave their homes?
Should they be forced to if they don't, or just
incentivized? How and where does the city plan
to move some of its poorest residents? Detroiters
are engaging in these debates every day, and I'm
grateful to be part of some of these discussions.
Engaging with Detroiters advocating for social
justice has made me realize the need for a more
complete assessment of Detroit's issues than the
mainstream media tends to put forth.
The learning opportunity that I'm most
grateful for this semester is something I don't
believe I would have fully realized in Ann
Arbor: I'm learning how to integrate the study
of Detroit's complex history with its living
present and the tremendous hope that Detroi-
ters hold for the city's future.

Universal cover-up

Yesterday's celebration of Eas-
ter followed Lent, which
Catholics use as a time for
self-reflection. We
try to recognize
our shortcomings,
seek forgiveness
and try to grow
spiritually. Humil-
ity is a big part of
the exercise.
Unfortunately,
some church lead-
ers didn't get the PATRICK
memo.
Cardinal Thom- O'MAHEN
as Dolan, the arch-_
bishop of New
York, provided a spirited Palm Sun-
day defense of Pope Benedict XVI's
reaction to the latest revelations of
clergy sexual abuse, comparing the
pontiff to Jesus enduring the taunts
of the Jewish high priests before his
crucifixion. In his Good Friday Mes-
sage, the Vatican's in-house preacher,
the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, com-
pared the church's experience during
the current scandal to anti-Semitism.
The arrogance of these state-
ments is only matched by their lack of
accountability. In return for the great
authority that the church's, hierar-
chy claims for itself, bishops need to
exhibit a strong sense of responsi-
bility. In the case of the abuse, that
includes public confessions and the
resignation of those who are respon-
sible, up to and including the pontiff,
if the evidence dictates it.
Those are strong statements,
so let's justify them by rewinding
the tape to examine the actions of
Church leaders during the whole
sorry episode of clergy sex abuse.
The story broke in the United
States in 1983, when Louisiana jour-
nalist Jason Berry reported on civil
litigation against Gilbert Gauthe, a
priest in the Diocese of Lafayette
accused of molesting dozens of boys.
When allegations against Gauther
surfaced, Bishop Gerard Frey qui-
etly transferred him to another par-
ish, refused to address the subject
with abuse victims and never called

the police. When Gauther was finally centrally involved in connection to
arrested, the lawsuits began. In testi- their despicable handling of the abuse
mony, Frey also admitted that he was cases - which involved nearly 200
sheltering another pedophile priest. priests and thousands of children.
By 1986, Berry's reporting uncovered
seven more priests accused of sexual
abuse.
In 1987, Cannon began pursu- Catholic leaders

condition, Brown said.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily Saturday night, Brown
refused to comment on the spe-
cific cause of the fire, but said that
"upholstered couches on porches
present an incredible life safety risk
for apartment residents."
Ann Arbor Fire Marshall Kath-
leen Chamberlain said in an inter-
view with the Daily Saturday
afternoon that the cause of the fire
is still under investigation.
"There's damage to the whole
house," Chamberlain said.
According to the release, a wit-
ness driving down State Street at
about 5:15 a.m. noticed a fire on the
porch of the house.
The press release stated that the
witness pulled over to notify the
occupants of the house, but the fire
quickly spread to the interior of the
building.
According to the release, five peo-
ple were inside the house at the time
the fire began, three of whom were
taken to the University Hospital.
Of the four residents who were
not transported to the hospital, at

decision to reappoint or not reap-
point the lecturer is made.
But LEO officials say Herold's
follow-up evaluation was met with
additional concerns that were not
brought up in her initial remedia-
tion plan. As such, LEO President
Bonnie Halloran said Herold was
not given the appropriate time to
address the English Department's
concerns.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said she could not
comment on the matter because
it involved a specific employee.
However, Cunningham did say
that, as in any reappointment
proceeding, University officials
would have followed the proper
steps as outlined in the Univer-
sity's contract with the lecturers'
union.
Associate Vice Provost Jeff
Frumkin is the senior director
of Academic Human Resources
and the University's chief nego-
tiator in the bargaining of labor

least three are University students.
Bryan Vessels, a University
senior who lives on the house's
main floor, said in an interview
with the Daily that he was able to
escape the house without injury.
"I was in my room in the back of
the house," Vessels said. "I got out
the back door."
Al Girard, a University senior
who lives across the street from
the house, said he woke up at about
5 a.m. and witnessed the blaze as
firefighters came.
"The whole front of the house
was on fire," Girard said.
Girard said that about a min-
ute after the fire trucks arrived,
he saw a woman on fire run out of
the house. According to Girard, the
woman ran across the street before
a firefighter intervened and sprayed
her with a fire extinguisher.
According to an annarbor.com
article, one person jumped from a
second story window, while two
others were rescued from the roof.
Captain Jim Budd, an Ann Arbor
firefighter, said in an interview
with the Daily that he arrived on
the scene at about 6 a.m.
By that time, Budd said the three
contracts with the various unions
at the University. In an interview
Friday, Frumkin said the Univer-
sity typically makes decisions to
reappoint or not reappoint Univer-
sity lecturers at this time each year,
with decisions made by April 1.
Frumkin said he could not
discuss the specific incident sur-
rounding Herold, but said he had
not been informed of any improp-
er handling of a reappointment
case and that as of Friday morning
no grievances had been filed.
Frumkin said to his knowledge
the established process for reap-
pointment had been followed.
"It hasn't been brought to my
attention that there have been
any procedural irregularities," he
said.
However, Frumkin said the
evaluation process is open to
interpretation as it can be difficult
to definitively quantify many per-
formance areas.
"All of these decisions involve
a certain amount of judgment,"
Frumkin said. "People can dis-
agree as to whether someone has
met the criteria or not.",

injured residents had been trans-
ferred to the hospital, but the house
"was still smoking."
At about 2:20 p.m. on Saturday
firefighters removed the caution
tape surrounding the house and
cleared the way for three employ-
ees of the' Belfor Property Resto-
ration group, who subsequently
began boarding up the house.
In another incident early Sat-
urday morning, students living
in The Abbey apartment building
were forced to evacuate after a fire
charred three cars parked below
the building, causing smoke dam-
age to some of the units above the
smoldering cars.
Though the crime alert refer-
enced several fires outside resi-
dences near campus, Brown said on
Saturday evening that she couldn't
confirm a connection between the
State Street fire and the fire below
The Abbey.
Officials are still investigating
the cause of the fire at The Abbey.
Investigators first arrived on the'
scene at about 3:15 a.m. Saturday
morning, according to Ann Arbor
Fire Department Battalion Chief
Kevin Cook.
LEO President Bonnie Halloran
said in an interview Friday that the
University handled Herold's reap-
pointment procedure improperly.
"She made the kind of changes
that were outlined in the reme-
diation plan and then at the end
of this process they came up with
additional problems that they had
identified in her teaching that
they had never ever talked to her
about before and terminated her
at the end of this year," Halloran
said.
Halloran added that this is not
the first case in which the Univer-
sity has used its own interpreta-
tion of evaluation criteria to get
rid of a lecturer.
"(The criteria) are vague. They
can be used however people want
to," Halloran said. "If you have
good scores, they think you're a
bad teacher because you give good
grades, if you have low scores
you're a bad teacher."
Halloran continued, "Things
are very aloof and departments
can use (criteria) however they
want and they're not held account-
able."

Most students were allowed
back in to the building, located
at 909 Church St., early Satur-
day morning. But at about 3:15
a.m. those students whose apart-
ments are located directly above
where the parked cars caught
fire were still waiting to find out
when they would be able to move
back in.
Cook said firefighters had to
knock down the doors of the most
affected apartments - which face
the alley behind the front entrance
of the building - and students
would not be let back in until the
doors could be properly locked or
replaced.
"I don't know if it will be done
tonight," Cook said in an interview
early Saturday morning.
As of Sunday evening AAFD offi-
cials said they couldn't comment
on whether the displaced residents
were allowed to move back into the
building.
Students at the scene said they
first became aware of the fire some-
time between 1:45 a.m. and 1:55
a.m. on Saturday.
Rackham student Robbie Brant,
who lives ina house near the build-
And while LEO bargainers are
advocating for a change in the
evaluation criteria and process in
an effort to make it more trans-
parent and hold departments
more accountable, some LEO
representatives believe the deci-
sion to terminate Herold's future
employment is a form of "union
retaliation," since Herold is on the
bargaining team and was serving
as the team's grievance officer.
"We have reason to believe that
there is union retaliation going on
here in the English Department
and we're very concerned that this
happened while we're in the pro-
cess of bargaining," Halloran said.
Adjunct Prof. Joe Walls, who
serves on LEO's bargaining team
and acts as a spokesman for the
group, said there are details sur-
rounding Herold's non-reappoint-
ment and the decision process
more generally, which he can't
make public, that have made some
LEO officials even angrier.
"We know more details about
the decision process, and what
was involved in the process but
we really aren't in a position to

ing, said he first called 911 at about
1:45 a.m., adding that he doesn't
think he was the first to call 911 to
report the fire.
"We could hear the popping," he
said. "I heard people screaming,
what I thought was fighting, and I
saw the car was on fire."
Engineering junior Saahil
Karpe, who lives in The Abbey, said
he first saw the fire from outside his
window.
"I came home from the bars and
was hanging out by myself and saw
some lights from my living room,"
Karpe said.
Karpe added that he was told to
evacuate the building by firefight-
ers on the scene and called his
friends who live in the building to
tell them to evacuate.
Michigan State University soph-
omore Austin Brooks said he was
on his way back to a friend's house
nearby when he first became aware
of the fire.
"I was walking outside and I
heard a huge pop," Brooks said.
He added that he saw the middle
of the three cars catch on fire first
and then the fire spread to cars to
the right and left.
reveal any of that information,"
Walls said. "There's some things
we know that we can't reveal that
make us even more angry than we
might be otherwise."
Walls said he finds the timing of
the incident a little strange, given
that contract negotiations are cur-
rently underway.
"We think the timing is rather
interesting that this is happening
in the midst of our bargaining and
she is on our bargaining team,"
Walls said. "On the other hand,
this is the time when these things
are supposed to be announced."
Contract negotiations are con-
tinuing as planned, but Walls
said he expects that negotiations
- originally planned to end next
week - will continue beyond Fri-
day's deadline.
"Theoretically next Friday is
our last day of bargaining, but the
contract doesn't expire until the
middle of May so we could con-
tinue to bargain past next Friday
and we think we probably will,"
Walls said.
Walls said he also expects that
Herold's non-reappointment will

LSA sophomore Vishal Shah said
when he got home from a party he
found that his car had caught on
fire. Shah said his car was the far-
thest right of the three.
"The middle car blew up and
mine just got caught up in the
mess," Shah said.
He added that he hadn't fully
comprehended the effects of the
fire.
"This will probably hit me
tomorrow," Shah said.
LSA sophomore David Baum-
stein said he didn't find out about
the fire until he was woken up by
Karpe, adding that if Karpe hadn't
called him he probably would have
never known about it.
"I was sleeping and then (Karpe)
called me and I just ignored the
phone call," he said. "Then I woke
up to the fire truck and I called him
back and he said 'you need to get
out of the building."'
Baumstein said he didn't hear
fire alarms going off in his apart-
ment or in the building's hallways.
"I didn't hear anything," he said.

Thorsby contributed to this report.
change the overall mood of nego-
tiations.
"Certainly the bargaining
team's mood has changed," Walls
said. "We don't know how the
rest of the membership will react,
but we anticipate that quite a few
members will be very unhappy
with this."
LEO is set to e-mail members
about this week's bargaining
efforts, at which time they will
inform members about Herold's
situation.
At negotiations Friday, LEO
bargainers left Herold's seat at the
table empty. Doing so was a pur-
poseful decision, according to Jim
Anderson, an English lecturer at
the University's Flint campus.
"We left her seat open today
symbolically and expressed our
anger with what has happened,"
Anderson said. "It's pretty rare,
I would say, for management to
fire a member of the union's bar-
gaining team during the middle of
negotiations."

buzz to the Blind

album Post-Nothing, which was
released in April 2009 on Unfa-

Japandroids's guitarist Brian
King talked to The Michigan Daily
as his band navigated the U.S.-
Canadian border on its way to a
concert in Montreal. The band's
current North American trek fol-
lows a year of constant touring,
and Japandroids will continue
through the spring and summer.
After a successful four-day stint
at Austin's South By Southwest
festival in March, Japandroids
has intensified its steady stream
of internet-buzz and undoubtedly
gained a new legion of avid fans.
Hopefully, the group's Ann
Arbor show will be better than its
last visit to the Great Lakes state.
"The Detroit show we played
last year was one of the worst
shows on the tour," King admit-

ted, "which is one of the reasons
why we're not playing there on
this tour and we're playing Ann
Arbor instead."
Although Japandroids's current
tour has been supported by label-
mates Love Is All, Brooklyn-based
psychedelic-rock troupe Bear In
Heaven will join the band for its
Ann Arbor stop - Bear In Heav-
en's only appearance throughout
Japandroids's entire tour.
"We were both playing Ann
Arbor on the same night, and
instead of trying to compete
against each other, we just decid-
ed to do a show together," King
explained. "That way people don't
have to pick whether they want to
see one band over the other."
All the better for Ann Arborites,
who can witness how Bear In
Heaven's electro-tinged jams
compliment Japandroids's rawer
guitar-and-drums sound.
When asked to describe his
band's aesthetic to the uninitiated
listener, King was refreshingly
simple.
"I think that we're just a garage
band," he said.
Although King's group doesn't
possess the British accents and
snappy proto-hipster outfits that
are normally associated with the
garage rock scene, Japandroids's

King, along with Japandroids

waste his time creating inventive
new genres to define his band's
sound. So don't expect them to be
tied down to no-fi, post-punk or,

God forbid, shit-gaze.

A synth-happy trip to
the'80s on 'Head First'

Alison Gold- Mute
frapp and Will
Gregory, better known as Gold-
frapp, defy those laws of physics
and transport their listeners to
another time: the '80s.
Goldfrapp's newest addition to
its five-album repertoire, Head
First, allows its fans to travel to
a time when cut-off denim shorts
were socially acceptable, MTV
actually played music videos and
mullets were, like, all the rage.
Head First melts together '80s
synth-pop beats with keyboard
melodies to produce an album

that evokes another generation
without ever leaving home.
The London-based electro-
pop band's antiquated influence
is present throughout its earlier
albums. After the band's previ-
ous mellowed-out album, this
concoction of out-of-this-world,
laser-beam sound effects and
keytar riffs draws in a different
crowd. Head First is a suitable fit
for club-goers and synth lovers.
The record opens with the
energetic track "Rockets." Elec-
tronic soundwaves flow through
the stereo as spacey dance beats
jump from chord to chord. Ali-

(paired with her equally feathery-
teased, blonde bangs) coalesces
into the discotheque beats for a
Xanadu effect.

even if your music wasn't different
from everybody else," he explained.
"It was getting so ridiculous to the
point where I just started sarcasti-
cally referring to ourselves as post-
nothing. We weren't post-anything.
Post-absolutely-nothing."
While this jab, which became
Japandroids's debut album title, is
partly King's way of mocking music
journalists who attempt to encapsu-
late a band's sound into a witty pack-
age, it's also an expression of King's
sarcastic sense of humor.
His irreverent, tongue-in-cheek
amusement is evident throughout
Post-Nothing. Whether reminisc-
ing about alcohol-drenched nights or
expressing his desire to "french kiss
some French girls," King's lyrics typi-
cally profess the glory of youth at the
expense of the boring 9-to-5 routine.
Despite his own grueling tour
schedule, King believes that these

themes are still present in his daily
life. Ultimately, his songs are about
"escapism" and he firmly believes they
can be relatable to high schoolers and
30-plusers alike.
"I think there are elements of
the lyrics and the themes of the
record that supercede age and super-
cede what's going on at every given
moment," he said. "They're reallygen-
eral and really universal in some way."
Japandroids's tour schedule has
prevented the group from working on
new music, but King believes he will
return to jam sessions in the fall. In
the meantime, the band will release
past material throughout the year in
the form of 7" records.
Before the band returns to the stu-
dio in the fall, it will continue to tour
throughout the U.S. and Europe with
stops at Bonnaroo Music Festival, Sas-
quatch! and Primavera Sound in Bar-
celona. With countless shows behind
them, including a sold-out appear-
ance at Manhattan's Bowery Ball-
room last Thursday, Japandroids will
surely give an energized performance
tonight at the Pig.

"Alive" is certainly a new-wave, dance

Also exceptional is the title track, in
which Goldfrapp longs for her newly
found love as she soulfully sings, "You

Head first in love." The track sets a
mood of breezy admiration and joyous
love, and the aphrodisiac atmosphere
is set with shooting-star effects and

While most of the tracks on the

though vintage, does semi-success-
fully convert to a well put-together
modern album. Gregory's compos-
ing skills combined with Goldfrapp's
soft vocals create a dreamy, poppy
album, but also one that lacks staying
power. The album is barely distinct
in that it sounds like a toned-down
Madonna performance. The duo tries
to glide back into its electronica roots
(after veering away in their fourth
album, 2008's Seventh Tree) and with
Head First they do so quite artfully.
Although Goldfrapp is back to its tra-
ditional tone, it seems as if the band is
afraid to sound original.
Time travel has been compacted
into a forty-minute journey back to
dancercise, roller-skates and spandex
hip-huggers. Goldfrapp's Head First
allows listeners to voyage through
other dimensions - no matter what
those crazy scientists say.

Cameron defeats
teammate and last
year's champ Kelley
By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - When junior
Chris Cameron finished second at
the Winter Cup Invitational in Feb-
ruary and was named the second-
best gymnast in America, that was
only the beginning.
This past weekend at the Big
Ten Championships, Cameron won
the all-around competition and
floor exercise, becoming the sec-
ond straight Wolverine to win the
crown.
He was named to the first team
All-Big Ten for the second consecu-
tive year, and was given the Big Ten
Gymnast of the Year award.
Even having accomplished all
that, Cameron was disappointed,
since the fourth-ranked Wolverines
weren't able to bring home a Big Ten
Championship on Friday night.
"I just had a decent night," Cam-
eron said. "Floor was definitely the
best event I had. I don't think I've
ever gotten into that mode before
when I just felt like a piece of steel
flipping around out there."
And with the all-around win,
Cameron, and last year's champion
Thomas Kelley still have one more

year of eligibility left.
"I think (Cameron) just has an
inner drive to succeed and become
the best gymnast he can become,"
Michigan coach Kurt Golder said.
"It's really hard to find, and we're
fortunate at Michigan to have a guy
that's driven that hard."
Cameron is only a junior, yet he
has accomplished more in his first
three years than many Wolverines
have in their entire careers.
Cameron was a 2009 NCAA All-
American, and has a good shot at
"He goes the
extra mile to
make sure he's
doing it right."
repeatingthat honor when the Wol-
verines compete at NCAAs in two
weeks.
"He's more dedicated than any
other gymnast I've ever met,"
junior Thomas Kelley, last years
all-around champion, said. "He's
got that little extra drive and little
extra confidence that I think a lot of
us aspire to have in our gymnastics.
"Just to go out, and know that
you're going to hit no matter what.

Chris doesn't waver. He's always
rock solid."
Cameron was also the runner-up
on the stillrings and made the finals
on Saturday on the parallel bars and
pommel horse.
Both Cameron and Kelley have
one year of eligibility remaining.
Not onlyis he particularly driven,
but he also has a natural ability to
push his teammates. He is a perfect
model of one who leads by example.
"He goes the extra mile to make
sure he's doing everything right,"
redshirt senior Ryan McCarthy
said. "When somebody would be
tired and cash in and go to the
showers, he takes that extra turn,
even when he's tired.
"He's really awesome to work out
with because he's motivating for
everyone. He holds everyone to a
high standard and that's really good
for our program."
In two weeks, Cameron will try
to lead Michigan to its first National
Championship since 1999.
When asked what the team will
need to do, Cameron didn't chalk it
up to simply getting better and hit-
ting all of its sets.
"We got to stop messing around
and trying to minimize deduc-
tions and stuff like that," Cameron
said. "Minimal shouldn't be in our
vocabulary anymore. Maximize
score, maximize height and maxi-
mize distance.
"Everything we do has to be
bigger, faster, and stronger."

Junior Chris Cameron is now a two-time first team All-Big Ten gymnast after his championship performance this weekend.


inishes second

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - Having shared
the Big Ten Championship with
Illinois last year, the No. 4 Michi-
gan men's gymnastics team was
looking to take the crown out-
right this year when it traveled to
St. John Arena this past weekend.
Unfortunately for the Wolver-
ines, after a disastrous pommel
horse routine, plagued with falls,
they were defeated Friday night
by 1.55 points at the hands of the
third-ranked Fighting Illini, fin-
ishing second in the conference.
Junior Chris Cameron won the
all-around competition and floor
exercise, along with the Big Ten
Gymnast of the Year award.
Usually, it's hard to blame one
event in particular for a team's
loss, but on Friday that was the
case. Michigan lost 2.65 points to
Illinois in that event alone. The
Fighting Illini had a solid perfor-
mance overall, but nowhere near
perfect.

"Illinois didn't hit every set,"
junior Chris Cameron said. "Our
hit percentage was probably high-
er but they had more champion-
ship-level sets and their starting
values were higher when it mat-
tered.
"We didn't hit pommels, and if
we did hit pommels, it would have
been a different story."
On Friday, the Wolverines took
part in the team competition, and
on Saturday, the individual event
competitions were held.
The meet consisted of six Big
Ten teams, five of them in the
top ten in the country: Illinois,
Michigan, No. 5 Ohio State, No. 6
Minnesota, No. 7 Penn State and
Iowa. Even with all the tough
competition, it was mostly a two-
horse race between the Wolver-
ines and Fighting Illini.
When it was all said and done,
the third-place Nittany Lions
were 10.85 points behind Michi-
gan.
"I think it was clear all year
that we were the two teams to

beat and that there was a drop,"
Michigan coach Kurt Golder said.
"My surprise is that I thought the
drop would maybe be about five
points, and we're looking at about
ten or eleven."
Other notable performances
for the Wolverines were senior
Mel Santander's second-place
finish in the all-around competi-
tion behind Cameron on Friday
and his third-place finish on the
parallel bars on Saturday.
Santander and junior Thomas
Kelley were also named to the
All-Big Ten first team.
All year, the Wolverines have
struggled with putting together a
full, poised competition.
Before their last dual meet
against Ohio State, when they set
an all around school record, they
had yet to do so.
They are always trying to fin-
ish the last two or three rota-
tions strong, and hope to do so at
NCAAs.
"We have to make our fifth

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Michigan beats Wildcats for
first time in thirteen years

SOFTBALL
Offensive explosion propels 'M'

By BRIAN MECHANICK
Daily Staff Writer
With the success the Michigan
women's tennis team has been
fighting, they might never want to
come home.
A weekend sweep of No. 4
Northwestern and Wisconsin
gave the Wolverines their ninth-
straight win, with the last seven
coming on the road.
No. 8 Michigan (5-0 Big Ten,
15-3 overall) defeated the Wild-
cats, 4-3, and the Badgers, 6-1, giv-
ing the Wolverines a 5-0 record in
conference play.
The Wolverines entered Sat-
urday's match at Northwestern
winless against the Wildcats
since 1997. Northwestern had not
lost in Big Ten competition since
April 2004, a winning streak of 81
matches.
The day got off to a strong start

as the Wolverines swept doubles
to take the pivotal first point.
Wolverine junior Denise Mure-
san dominated 13th ranked Maria
Mosolova - the same player to
whom she lost in the fall - 6-3,
6-0.
"I saw her in the fall," Muresan
said. "So I knew how she played
and how Ihad to play. I was able to
just play smart today, hit my shots
and take my opportunities."
But two straight Northwest-
ern(4-1 Big Ten, 13-4 overall)
wins tied the overall score, 2-2.
No. 5 singles stemmed the tide, as
senior Tania Mahtani got the cru-
cial win. Down 5-2 in the first set,
Mahtani rallied to win 7-5, 6-3.
"I got off to a rough start,"
Mahtani said, "I was trusting my
game, but I wasn't quite execut-
ing in the beginning of the first

calm, and knew that I was going
to be able to come back."
Freshman Mimi Nguyen
clinched the match for the Wol-
verines with a straight-set win in
No. 4 singles.
"It shows the progress of the
program," Michigan coach Ron-
nie Bernstein said. "Northwest-
ern is the team to beat in the Big
Ten, so we've definitely caught up
to them. The girls have improved
a lot and it's just a good group. We
work hard, and we believe in our-
selves, so it really doesn't matter
who we're playing."
In Sunday's match at Wiscon-
sin, the Wolverines again got off
to a strong start as they swept
doubles to take the first point.

You would be hard-pressed
to find a weekend on the softball
schedule as lopsided as last week-
end was.

all) squared MICHIGAN 8
off against
Wisconsin in their second Big Ten
matchup of the season. And from
the first inning on a drizzly Satur-
day afternoon in Ann Arbor, there
was little competition.
Over the series' two games,
Michigan tallied 18 hits, while Wis-
consin mustered just two (one in
each game). Michigan crossed the
plate 23 times. Wisconsin never
managed to do so, as the Wolverines
won 15-0 on Saturday and 8-0 on
Sunday.
With the eight-run mercy rule in
effect, neither game surpassed five
innings.

This was a fate the Badgers
(0-4, 8-20) have met before - the
last time they were shut out back-
to-back was last April in Madison
against the visiting Wolverines.
Saturday's game featured a
Michigan lineup that performed
well from top to bottom. The only
starter who didn't get a hit, senior
catcher Roya St. Clair, still drove in
a run on a sacrifice fly to right field
that opened up the scoring for a
10-run second inning. Sophomore
second baseman Amanda Chidester
hit a two-run shot to left in the first
inning, and senior third baseman
Maggie Viefhaus smacked an oppo-
site field three-run homer to left in
the following frame.
Senior centerfielder Molly Baush-
er continued to prove her worth
from the nine-hole in the lineup
as well, as she hit a bases-clearing
double to the wall in left center that
blew open the second inning.
"The nine-hitter is a very impor-
tant role," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "To me, it's a place
of honor. Her job is to have good at-
bats, turn the lineup over and make

things happen. And I have main-
tained for the lasttwo years, at least,
that when Molly Bausher is getting
on base, we're winning games."
Junior pitcher Jordan Taylor
needed to toss just three innings
to' earn her 14th win of the sea-
son. Once the Wolverines went up
by 15, Hutchins cleared the bench
and replaced Taylor with freshman
Stephanie Speierman, even though
Taylor had a no-hitter in the mak-
ing.
"It was a chance for us to get
Steph (Speierman) in the game,"
Hutchins said. "Jordan was throw-
ing a no-hitter, but if Steph doesn't
get some innings, it's going to be
hard to develop her and hard to
keep her motivated. It was too good
of an opportunity to pass up."
The freshman hurler seized the
opportunity, as she struck out four
over two innings of work. She did
give up a bloop single to right with
two outs in the fifth inning to lose
the combined no-hitter, but she
came back strong to strike out the
next batter and end the game.

Why the 96-team
NCAA Tourney is
a great idea

'M' wins series despite blowout

4

I've been fairly surprised by
the general level of hatred for
the idea of a 96-team NCAA
Tournament. In the midst of one
of the craziest March Madnesses
(would it be Madnessi? Not really
sure on the pluralization here.) in
recent memory,
it comes out
that Big Ten
Commissioner
Jim Delany says
expansion will
probably hap- "
pen, and people
aren't excited. ANDYM
I don't get it. REID
More is
always better,
right?
I've heard all the cons. It's going
to water down the first couple
rounds of the tournament. I don't
buy it. First, there's something
amazingly fun about tuning in to
CBSSports.com during class for
the first weekend of the tourna-
ment. And the expansion will just
give us more of the hectic sensory
overload of the first two rounds.
You're on game overload at that
point, and, it doesn't really matter
that No. Is are putting a beating on
No. 16s, because, with that many
simultaneous tipoffs, there's bound
to be some interesting storyline to
follow.
It's my favorite part of the
tournament because it's just so
engaging. And I think adding 32
more teams will have the opposite
effect of what some naysayers are
predicting. We'll just have more
games to watch, that's all.
I don't think it'll alter the level
of competition in the early rounds
too much, especially after the for-
mula has been in place for a few
years and teams like Southeastern
Indiana State (I'm pretty sure

that's a made-up school) get used
to makingthe Big Dance.
Second, people think it'll make
the regular season irrelevant.
Here's the thing: With 96 teams
in the field of play, there's still
251 teans that will be watching
the festivities from home. It's not
like the NCAA is handing out bids
like their degrees from Michigan
State. Even post-expansion, teams
are still going to have to work for
it.
A team like North Carolina, for
example, wouldn't have just been
given a free pass into the tourna-
ment this year. There's plenty of
schools out there that posted great
regular seasons that deserve a shot
at being on this stage - maybe
they're not goingto win the whole
thing, but so what? The experience
is something they can tell their
grandkids about.
I'll level with you for a second.
I wasn't exactly thrilled with the
idea when I heard the first rumors
circulating the Internet.
But, as a self-identifying opti-
mist, I'm going to find the bright
side. And there definitely is one
with a 96-team tournament. I'm
sure there was the same level of
skepticism when they expanded
to 64.
They're going to expand -
there's too much money at stake
not to.
It's going to be fine. March is
still going to be mad, and in three
years, I can all but guarantee you
that no one will be ruing the day
they added another weekend to the
craziest tournament in sports.
After all, it'll give all you college
kids yet another reason not to pay
attention in class.

BLOOMINGTON - A thrilling
extra-innings comeback victory
on Friday, a heart-stopping narrow
triumph on
Saturday and MICHIGAN 16
a tie for first INDIANA 10
in the confer-
ence, and yet INDIANA 4
the Michigan
baseball team MICHIGAN 6
faced one INDIANA 26
of its most
depressingtrips home this season.
That ride home will be what the
Wolverines remember about their
trip to Bloomington, thanks to a
devastating 26-6 loss at the hands
of the Hoosiers on Sunday after
16-10 and 6-4 wins in the first two
games.
Senior left-hander Eric Katzman
(1-1), who pitched in the last two
games of the series, including a
nearly flawless performance Sat-
urday, just couldn't perform in
the starting role Sunday. He gave
up five runs in 0.2 innings, set-
ting a bad precedent for those who
relieved him.
The Hoosiers constantly obliter-
ated anything that came their way,
and the Michigan (2-1 Big Ten,
15-10 overall) pitching staff com-
bined to yield 26 runs on 27 hits -
both easily the highest totals of the
season.
"I wish I could tell you (what
happened)," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said. "We just had
a bunch of guys out there and it
snowballed. It started, it just never
ended. No one was able to stop the
momentum once it got going. Just
one of those games that got away
from us early."
Defense, too, is suddenly a con-
cern for the team after it totaled 11
errors over the weekend. It was an
uncharacteristic performance for
the Wolverines, who had played
solidly in the field for much of the
season.
"We had a couple outfield errors
* this weekend and those are really
- you really don't want those to
happen," senior first baseman and
co-captain Mike Dufek said. "It
was pretty windy here, but we've
played at windy places before. We
just got to get back and work on it
this week in practice."

Senior Mike Dufek, pictured here against Michigan State, knocked in two runs in the 10th to win the game.

But luckily for Michigan, the
team had already clinched the
series before the ugly finale with
wins Friday and Saturday.
The Wolverines threw their ace,
senior right-hander Alan Oaks on
the hill on Friday, but he struggled
to put away opposing hitters, giv-
ing up eight runs (three earned) in
2.1 innings. When Michigan looked
at the scoreboard in the seventh, it
found itself down 9-3 to Indiana
(1-2 Big Ten, 13-13 overall).
That's when the comeback
began. Michigan put five runs on
the board in the inning (including
four off Chris Squires, Indiana's
best reliever) and two more in the
eighth to take the 10-9 lead. The
Hoosiers refused to yield, though,
scoring once in the bottom of the
frame to tie the gdme and send it to
extras.
With the bases loaded in the top
of the 10th, senior captain Mike
Dufek delivered. The Scottsdale,
Ariz. native laced one to right field
to plate two decisive runs. Redshirt
sophomore utility man Garrett Ste-
phens followed with his firstcareer
grand slam for good measure.

"I noticed (Hoosier pitcher
Jerry Kleman) ... didn't really have
a third pitch he was throwing to
lefthanders, so I was looking for a
fastball," Dufek said. "The second
pitch was a fastball inside and was
able to get my hands in on it and hit
it pretty hard." .
And though Michigan led the
entire way Saturday, the game was
just as tense as the night before.
The Wolverines jumped all over
Hoosier starting pitcher Matt Igel,
notching five runs in the first three
innings.
But Igel settled down and
Indiana, like Michigan the game
before, refused to quit. The Hoo-
siers quickly tallied one run in the
third and three in the fourth and
suddenly it was a 5-4 game. The
next inning, they loaded the bases
with no outs and had redshirt
freshman left-hander Bobby Bros-
nahan on the ropes.
Maloney decided to keep the
southpaw in the game despite his
struggles, and the decision paid
off Brosnahan got three straight
outs to preserve the lead and ended

four-run baseball, striking out
seven in the process.
"It was a battle out there today,"
Brosnahan said. "I had (the bases
loaded) earlier in the game, so I
just knew if I could make the right
pitch, I'd be able to get out of it. It
was a huge momentum swing and
it really lifted the team."
Sunday's debacle dampened the
team's spirits, but the two wins
and the series sweep was already
in hand.
The Wolverines still won the
series and are tied for first in the
Big Ten because of it. But the som-
berness will be difficult to shake,
despite the success of the trip.
"The reality is I'd rather have
the two wins and a bad loss than
the other way around," Maloney
said.
"We got two wins, we just have
to play better than we did ... but the
bottom line is we got two wins on
the road which is what we came
here for."

The largest regular-season
crowd in program history packed
into Canham Natatorium Saturday
afternoon to witness the first-ever
televised Michigan water polo
match.
The match INDIANA 4
was everything MICHIGAN 6
for the Wolver-
ines, a televised battle against bit-
ter rival No. 15 Indiana. It was an
opportunity to clinch their third
consecutive CWPA Western regu-
lar-season title and also claim the
top seed in the upcoming Western
Division Championship. All was
accomplished in a 6-4 victory over
the Hoosiers.
The game also marked the return
of injured senior captain Leah Rob-

Michigan has been lacking, tallying

steals. Robertson had no idea of her
record-setting performance.
"I really was just focused on hav-
ing a big rivalry game at home,"
Robertson said. "It's our only Big

home is really important."

ing with a back-handed rocket that

Speierman provides third option
for Wolverines on the mound

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Writer
A quick glance at the Michigan
softball team's personell imme-
diately tells you something about
coach Carol Hutchins.
She has tremendous faith in her
pitchers - she must if she only car-
ries three of them on her roster.
The second-ranked Wolverines
(3-0 Big Ten, 26-5 overall) are one
of six ranked NCAA teams with just
three hurlers. Most teams have two
starters, along with at least two or
three arms available in the bullpen.
Critics often wonder - what
happens if one of those starters
has a rough outing, and there's not
enough relief? But Hutchins has
never been particularly concerned
about that. It's a question that she
and her players shrug off.
"That's fine," senior third base-
man Maggie Viefhaus said. "If one
of them doesn't do well, we have
two other pitchers that will come
out and beat you anyway. It doesn't
matter who's on the mound. We're
going to beat you."
All-Americans Nikki Nemitz and
Jordan Taylor have pitched for 200
of the team's 211 innings this sea-
son.
But who is the third pitcher of
whom fans hear, but see so little?
Who is the one that is bound to step
in for Nemitz next season?
Her name is Stephanie Speier-

man, a freshman righty who spent
the last four seasons shattering
high school records in Maryland.
She set eight different marks,
including career strikeouts (1,363),
single-season strikeouts (426),
single-season wins (23) and single-
season ERA (0.00).
Moreover, she could poten-
tially fill Nemitz's role as a hitting
pitcher, as she batted a career .462
over her four years at Hammond
High.
"Well, I'm not opposed to (put-
ting her in the lineup)," Hutchins
said. "Anytime you got a player that
can pitch and hit, my philosophy is
the best nine hitters are in the line-
up. So, if she's one of them, then she
will be."
So far, it's difficult to tell wheth-
er or not Speierman's high school
dominance will convert to the
NCAA level as it did for Nemitz and
junior Jordan Taylor. Through her
first seven appearances, in which
she's pitched 11 innings, she's given
up five earned runs and two hom-
ers.
One may chalk up those num-
bers to inexperience or a lack of
routine starts, but her stats are
comparatively weak when look-
ing at Nemitz and Taylor's rookie
year numbers - they finished with
ERAs of 1.88 and 0.76, respectively.
But after this weekend, Speier-
man put some of those concerns to
rest.


SOFTBALL
From Page lB
Sunday afternoon's game fin-
ished in similar fashion, but the
Wolverines spread out their scoring
this time, crossing the plate at least
once in every inning.
Senior lefty Nikki Nemitz took
the mound and threw five innings
of one-hit ball to earn her 11th
win. Nemitz has been hot lately
after starting the season 1-3 -
she's now won each of her last
nine starts.

Hutchins and her players like to
compare their day-to-day attitude
to the mantra that's governed com-
petition for the Connecticut wom-
en's basketball team. Focus on one
game at a time.
"The kids really like UConn bas-
ketball. They've been following it,"
Hutchins said. "One thing we know
about UConn is that they're very
intense, they practice really hard
and they go after every game the
same.
"It doesn't matter who they're
playing. I like that mentality, and I
think it's Michigan softball mental-
ity."

limited what
the children
could do with
the basketball.
That's why
Michigan women's bas-
ketball coach Kevin Borseth
insists he never learned to shoot.
In late February, sitting in the
plush maize and blue coaches'
locker room in Crisler Arena,
Borseth couldn't pinpoint
exactly how he wound up
with a Division I coach-
ing job at a nationally
renowned university.
"One thing led td anoth-
er, and here I am," he said.
"I'd explain that but one
thing just kind of led to
another."
"I think there's a
gauge inside of us that
says I want to be the
best at what I do," he

said."A long time ago someone gave us a pat on the
back because we did something good and we never
forgot that.
"It's like the horse who got the sugar cube. Peo-
ple gravitate towards doing well because they get
pats on the back for it. And I don't think my career
is different than anybody else's is."
Falling in love with the game
As a third grader, Borseth had his first experi-
ence in a big game.
Borseth's recreational league team split up to
scrimmage at halftime of a high school basket-
ball game. The aspiring youngsters had dribbled
around chairs to practice fundamentals for their
big game.
For the young Borseth, nothing was bigger than
that moment.
"It was huge," he said. "It was the NBA cham-
pionship."
That exciting atmosphere helped fuel Borseth's
love for basketball, a sport he continued to play
through high school along with baseball and foot-
ball.
Bessemer High School saw four head football
coaches and an unimpressive record during Bors-
eth's time as quarterback. Pat Gallinagh, an All-
American defensive lineman for Michigan State
in the 1960s, took over as head coach in Borseth's
senior year.
Trying to get the program back on track, Gal-
linagh added a Saturday morning practice to the
team's weekly schedule, which already included
two-a-days Monday through Friday.
"Just about the whole team boycotted the prac-
tice, but Kevin went and talked to all of them and
got them back out for the team so the program
didn't disintegrate," Gallinagh said in a phone
interview.
The next fall, Borseth went to Lake Superior
State for college, instead of a place like Michi-
gan, where according to Gallinagh, he could have
played if he had had consistent coaching through-
out high school. But he stayed close to home and
played basketball, his favorite sport.
A decade after playing outdoor basketball dur-
ing frigid Michigan winters as a kid, Borseth grad-
uated and moved back home, where he finally got
his hands on the keys to the local gym when he
volunteered to watch over the kids playing there.
It was at that gym in Bessemer where Borseth
realized his passion for coaching.
With the keys, the gym was his. He would shoot
around until the kids that came to practice on Sat-
urday mornings showed up. Then he would give
them pointers.
He wanted them to have that same memory he
had, when he scrimmaged at the high school game,
so he prepared them for their owntime in the lime-
light.
Around the same time, he began working as the
assistant football and baseball coach at his alma
mater, Bessemer High. Gallinagh recalls Borseth's
ability to yell at his players without making them

upset. A few years later, it was clear his tactic was
working.
"The two seasons he coached with me we were
something like 19 or 20-3, so we had really good
years," Gallinagh said.
While he got his feet wet in football coaching,
Borseth was also testing his mettle as a basketball
player in a local league. His team traveled region-
ally to play different teams, one of those at a nearby
low-security prison.
When he later lost his job in the homebuilding
industry as interest rates soared and his employer
was forced to close its doors in1983, he found a new
job at Gogebic Community College in Ironwood,
Mich. Borseth taught business classes, coached the
women's basketball team and served as an assis-
tant coach for the men's team.
In his five years as head coach for the women's
team at Gogebic, he built a program from scratch.
When Borseth took the job, the women's team
had two players. It was up to him to recruit the rest
from the classes he taught. After starting 0-7 that
first year, Borseth's team finished 11-11. In his last
two years combined, his teams went 35-14.
"That first year was probably the most fun I've
ever had coaching," Borseth said. "All you do is
learn to play games and play against programs
that probably have the same level of commitment
by their athletes as your programs and that isn't a
great deal."
Another part of his job was to supervise the
same prison gym he had traveled to as a player, at
Camp Ojibway. He was there every night just to
keep things in order, but took it upon himself to
give the prisoners some basketball pointers.
"I made it like hockey where you couldn't pass
too many (lines) because (the prisoners) would just
get the rebound and throw it to the other end of the
court," Borseth said. "I made them pass the ball up
the court."
Movin' on up
In 1988, Borseth landed his first job at a four-
year institution, coaching the women's team at
Division II Michigan Tech, a team that had never
experienced a winning season. Borseth had his
work cut out for him.
He wasted no time turning the Huskies into a
national powerhouse, taking them to the NCAA
Division II Championships seven times in his 11
years at the helm, amassing a 225-97 record.
Borseth went to the University of Wisconsin-
Green Bay in 1999 for his first Division I job. The
fanbase doubled in his nine years as head coach at
Wisconsin-Green Bay, according to athletic direc-
tor Ken Bothof, partly because fans came to watch
his one-of-a-kind sideline demeanor, something
that's attracted attention everywhere he's been.
From anywhere in the stands - even at Crisler,
which seats 13,800 - one can look toward the
bench and Borseth will be pacing in front ofit, yell-
ing out to his athletes. He is often so loud you can
hear him shouting but can't make out quite what.
And all the while he is flailing his arms like an

orchestra conductor.
"I think our fans always found him in his own
way to be entertaining," Bothof said.
"When our fans saw the passion that he had for
the game, I think that led to great atmosphere at
our games," he said. "Our fans fed off of that. They
talked about how it was fun to come to games
because obviously we were winning but they also
loved to watch some of (Borseth's) actions through
the game as well."
The arena was sold out for most games and
the girls rarely lost. But that didn't mean Borseth
wasn't yelling at the top of his lungs. Under Bors-
eth, the Lady Phoenix won nearly 78 percent of
their games, never losing more than three confer-
ence games in any of his nine seasons at the helm.
The program was 24 years old when Borseth
took charge and Green Bay had seen the postsea-
son only three times in its history, including an
NCAA run that took place the season prior to his
takeover.
Borseth didn't skip a beat, leading Green Bay to
the NCAA Tournament in his first two years and
five more times in his seven remaining years with
the program. The team never missed out on post-
season action with Borseth in charge, playing in
the Women's National Invitational Tournament
the two years it didn't go dancing.
Fans could expect to be greeted by him at the
door on their way in. And he and his family waited
customarily on the court if fans wanted to touch
base after games.
Wisconsin-Green Bay loved Borseth, and Bors-
eth loved Wisconsin-Green Bay. He started getting
attention from elsewhere, but he wasn't going to
leave for just anything.
Borseth turned down a head coaching job at the
University of Colorado. But when Michigan offered
him the head coaching position for its women's
basketball team in 2007, it looked like the dream of
a lifetime could become a reality.
"He wanted to be at the University of Michi-
gan all his life," Gallinagh said. "I think if he had
a chance to playthere he would have jumped at it."
Borseth identified with Michigan colors from an
early age, sporting a blue and gold jersey as quar-
terback for Bessemer High. He remembers look-
ing up to Bessemer alumni Ralph Heikkanen, an
All American for the Wolverines in the 190s; and
Reuben Kelto, Michigan's MVP in 1941.
"It'slikelivinga dream,"said Borseth, whomade
his first trip to Ann Arbor for a Michigan-Ohio
State football game in the '70s. "And to the people
in my area, it's absolutely off the charts. They are
all Michigan fans, too. That's what we do."
A year to build on
Borseth played football for four coaches in four
years at Bessemer High School. And while that's no
easy task, especially for a quarterback who must
adjust to a new style every year as a result - it's
not easy for a coach either. Gallinagh had a lot of
work to do when he took the head football job at
Bessemer Borseth's senior year. The program had

been in shambles in recent years, according to Gal-
linagh, who recalls that the team had won maybe
two games in the previous three years.
But the Bessemer football program had a history
of excellence. And with a steady coach again, the
program quickly rebounded.
When Borseth arrived at Michigan three years
ago, he didn't have the luxury of a strong tradition.
During these last three years, he has been working
to put his stamp on the program.
"Most of (Michigan's opponents) had penciled
in a victory before they even went out on the court
to take a shot," Gallinagh said. "That's why they
were able to pull so many upsets in (Borseth's) first
year there."
In the three seasons before Borseth came to Ann
Arbor, the Wolverines won four conference games
total.
In his inaugural year, Michigan was a.500 team
and got past the first round of the Big Ten tourna-
ment.
"The problem was when he first got in there I
don't think anybody took University of Michigan
women's basketball seriously and now everybody
takes them seriously," Gallinagh said. "They've
upset a number of teams so far since he's been there
and that's the way you build a program. A little bit
at a time you pull an upset."
"I've done so well for so long that I never felt
the other side of it," Borseth said. "And now I feel
the other side of it. It's not fun. Now we are trying
to build a program where we can win conference
championships and get NCAA bids here as well.
And we are at a national university where the sky's
the limit."
Despite this newfound and rather unexpected
success this season, his first three years in the Big
Ten haven't been all roses. After a-better-than-
expected first year in which the team went 9-9 in
conference, 17-20 overall and made a run to the
quarterfinals of the WNIT, Borseth didn't sleep
much last season, whenthe team ended the confer-
ence schedule 3-15.
In that first year with the program, Borseth
gained some fame that he might have done with-
out. When his team gave up an 18-point lead to
Wisconsin to lose by two, he learned firsthand
what it means to be on a national stage.
In the postgame press conference, Borseth's fists
slammed, his papers flew and he made his frustra-
tion over what he saw as an unacceptable lack of
offensive rebounds known to a room of reporters.
While his conductor-like demeanor shows his pas-
sion and intensity for the game, failing to control
his emotions in the filmed press conference made
him the laughingstock of college sports for a brief
time.
But as he begins to make a name for the Michi-
gan program, next time his name is being talked
about nationally, it will be on a sweeter note.
After 25 years, he had coached at the commu-
nity college, Division II and DivisionI levelsbefore
coming to Ann Arbor. And his resume prior to
Michigan was looking pretty snazzy - 70 percent

of the time his team came out on top.
He was warned that he would have to get usedto
losing more atthe next level, butnothing could pre-
pare him for the level of competition in the Big Ten.
"We aren't over the hump yet," he said at the end
of February with two regular-season games left.
"We've stillgot aways to go with our program. We
are tryingto build a base so we are a credible wom-
en's basketball program for all the young aspiring
athletes that want to be able to play for a program
that's got some tradition."
This year's squad, in Borseth's third season,
beat expectations to go 8-10 in the regular season
before advancing to the quarterfinals in the Big
Ten Tournament. Considered on the bubble for the
NCAA Tournament, Michigan ultimately settled
for a WNIT bid. The Wolverines proved them-
selves, blowing out four opponents en route to the
Final Four of the WNIT to make program history.

And Borseth believes his team's WNIT run acts
as a good building block toward the national com-
petitor he hopes to make the Wolverines.
"A year like this hopefully makes some people
stand up and take a look at our program and say
hey, they are for real, these guys are for real," Bors-
eth said after the 76-59 loss to Miami in the Final
Four that ended the Wolverines' season. "I think
years like this hopefully we can use to build on."
It hasn't been an easy three years, but this sea-
son's success is just the beginning of what could be
the most successful Borseth era - on his biggest
stage yet. Every day he goes to work, every time he
puts on his navy sports coat with a maize interior
to pace the sideline, he is reminded that he is living
his dream. There is nowhere else he would rather
be.
Borseth's still got the keys to the gym, but this
one seats 13,800.
