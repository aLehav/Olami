CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED-TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Pi Kappa Phi 
charity event 
benefits local 
organization

By BRANDON 

SUMMERS-MILLER

For the Daily

Members of the University’s 

Pi Kappa Phi fraternity chapter 

took to wheelchairs and faced 
off against the Michigan Rollin’ 
Pistons — a youth wheelchair bas-
ketball team — Wednesday night 
to raise funds as part of the frater-
nity’s philanthropic activities.

The event in the University’s 

Sports Coliseum featured two 
games: one pitting the fraternity 
against the Pistons, and the 
other mixing members of each 
organization together to form 
new teams.

The Rollin’ Pistons are mem-

bers of the National Wheelchair 
Basketball Association and travel 
and compete throughout the Mid-
west. The team is made up of kids 
with physical disabilities ages six 
to 18 from across the state.

John McSween, a sophomore 

at Father Gabriel Richard Catho-
lic High School in Ann Arbor, said 
he enjoyed the event because it 
was a way for him to display his 
athleticism despite his disability.

“I couldn’t really play any 

school sports,” he said. “This was a 

way to show my competitiveness.”

A portion of the event’s pro-

ceeds will go to the Rollin’ Pistons 
to cover travel costs and help the 
team buy new jerseys. The wheel-
chair basketball game is part of a 
series of fundraising events put 
on by the fraternity this week, 
called “War of the Roses.”

LSA junior Zachary Robinson, 

Pi Kappa Phi philanthropy chair, 
said it was important that his fra-
ternity host the basketball game

Make Michigan, 
DAAP parties 

talk campus issues

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

Though the questions asked 

at Wednesday night’s Central 
Student 
Government 
presi-

dential and vice presidential 
debates covered a wide range of 
areas, the candidates’ answers 
tended to return to a central 
theme: diversity.

Executive candidates from 

The Team, Make Michigan and 
the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party were given one hour to 
respond to 10 questions, as were 
the vice presidential candidates 
from each party.

Aaron 
Kall, 
director 
of 

debate for the University, mod-
erated the responses. For each 
round of debates, the candidates 
provided two-minute opening 

statements.

The 
topic 
of 
diversity 

appeared in conversation about 
the 
University’s 
low 
Black 

enrollment, 
and 
considered 

how CSG could play a role in 
approaching this issue. Cur-
rently, the University’s Black 
student enrollment sits at 4.63 
percent.

Engineering 
junior 
Will 

Royster, The Team’s presiden-
tial candidate, said he hopes to 
increase

Black representation at the 

University to 10 percent — a 
demand that has also been 
raised by the University’s Black 
Student Union. Further, he 
believes the University’s efforts 
to broaden the admission pro-
cess to attract more minority 
students has not been enough.

“The next step moving for-

ward is empowering students 
on campus,” Royster said.

LSA junior Keysha Wall, 

DAAP’s presidential candidate, 
opened the debate by express-
ing that she is “disgusted with

Wolverines take 
early lead, rout 

Cleveland State at 

Crisler Center

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

It had been nearly a month 

since the Michigan women’s 
basketball team had tasted vic-
tory. Separated by a loss to Illi-
nois and a Big Ten Tournament 
letdown, the Wolverines’ season 
was salvaged for at least one 
more game.

Wednesday night at Crisler 

Center, Michigan (8-10 Big Ten, 
17-14 overall) finally got back on 
track in the first round of the 
WNIT. Behind an impeccable 
2-3 zone defense and a well bal-
anced offense, the Wolverines 
breezed past Cleveland State 
with a 72-50 rout in the teams’ 
first meeting since 1986.

The Michigan Daily will be 

exploring Ann Arbor’s most quirky, 
lively, and student populated neigh-
borhoods during the next month to 
see what makes this city tick. Read 
the first installment about the Old 
Fourth Ward here.

Walk southwest of Central 

Campus and you’ll find yourself 
in the neighborhoods of Elbel 
Field and Yost Ice Arena, homes 
to student-athletes, the marching 
band 
and 
cost-conscious 

undergraduates, 
alike. 
These 

student-populated 
enclaves 

represent two of Ann Arbor’s 11 
distinct neighborhoods.

Elbel

Situated around Elbel Field 

and within walking distance of 
both Central and South Campus, 
the Elbel neighborhood is a con-
venient, affordable location for 
students, with undergraduates 
making up the majority of the 
neighborhood.

Elbel Field is named after 

Michigan alum Louis Elbel, com-
poser of “The Victors.” Appro-
priately, the Michigan Marching 
Band holds its practices at the 
eponymously field at the heart of 
the neighborhood. For this rea-
son, many of the marching band’s 
members choose to live in the 
neighborhood.

Snyder requests $500,000 
for sexual assault prevention

Governor’s budget 
proposal awaits 
approval from 
state legislature

By EMMA KINERY 

Daily Staff Reporter

In this year’s budget proposal, 

Gov. Rick Snyder (R) included 
a 
one-time 
appropriation 
of 

$500,000 for improving efforts 
to prevent sexual assault on 
college campuses in Michigan.

The proposal for exactly how 

the funds will be used has not 
totally been made clear. The plan 
for the funds reads: “The sexual 
assault prevention and education 
initiative will provide a system-
wide 
approach 
to 
develop 

comprehensive prevention best 
practices, assessment strategies, 
and effective response efforts.”

So far, the only action that 

has been discussed is a potential 
forum 
between 
the 
Snyder 

administration 
and 
officials 

from 
Michigan 
universities. 

Cynthia Wilbanks, vice president 
of government relations at the 
University, said the University 
has been contacted about the 
forum.

“We don’t have a lot of details 

on the specific uses for the 
$500,000, but I can tell you that 
the governor’s wife has reached 
out to universities to help think 
about a forum that would be 
focused on sexual assault and 
prevention, and in this early 
discussion, I think the focus will 
be really around education and 
awareness,” she said.

Dave Murray, deputy press 

secretary 
for 
the 
Snyder 

administration, 
confirmed 

such a forum is currently up for 
discussion, but said it is just in 
the planning stages.

“Right now there are just no 

details,” Murray said. “They have 
not begun to put together the 
plan for those events.”

Mike 
Boulus, 
executive 

director 
for 
the 
President’s 

Council of the State Universities 
of Michigan, spoke on behalf 
of the university presidents of 
Michigan, saying they were all 
willing to work with Snyder on 
his proposed initiative.

“Governor 
Snyder’s 

commitment to this issue is to 
be commended,” Boulus wrote 
in an e-mail. “He mentioned that 
it was a priority during a recent 
meeting with presidents — and 
they all agree.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel has also said he wants 
to better address sexual assault 
on campus. 

In 
January, 
Schlissel 

announced plans to release a 
survey to gauge campus climate 
around sexual misconduct.

State Rep. Adam Zemke (D–

Ann Arbor) said he did not have 
enough information to comment 
on the proposal at this time.

Murray said the forum and 

other 
brainstorming 
sessions 

will likely initiate ideas for new 
programs and policies. 

He said there hasn’t been a 

lot planning to date because 
the governor’s proposal still 
needs to achieve passage in the 
legislature, he said.

“Right now we’re in the 

appropriations part, and the 
legislature could accept that, 
or they could change it, or they 
could eliminate it,” he said. 
“We’re working with them on 
the budget now, it’s a process that 
won’t be determined fully until 
likely the end of June, that’s the 
goal. So there’s a lot of things that 
could happen between now and 
then.”

Murray 
said 
the 
Snyder 

administration is hopeful the 
legislature 
would 
choose 
to 

appropriate the $500,000 when 
deciding what to pass in the 
budget plan. 

Religious women 
support employer 

contraceptive 

coverage, study finds

By COLLEEN HARRISON 

Daily Staff Reporter

Religion may play less of a 

role in predicting a woman’s 
positions on reproductive health 
policy than previously thought.

A new study led by Elizabeth 

Patton, 
clinical 
lecturer 
of 

obstetrics 
and 
gynecology, 

randomly 
selected 
2,520 

English-speaking women ages 
18 to 55 on their views around 
several 
policies 
related 
to 

reproductive health. Of those, 
1,028 women responded to the 
survey.

The study found more than 

60 percent of women strongly 
affiliated 
with 
Protestant 

and Catholic religious groups 
supported 
employee 
health 

insurance plans that cover birth 
control. 

Religious 
affiliation 
was 

determined by the women’s self-
identification and the frequency 
of “religious attendance.”

Patton 
said 
the 
study’s 

authors 
were 
motivated 
in 

part by the recent controversy 
around contraception coverage 
and religious discourse. They 
noted the recent debate was 
largely 
fueled 
by 
the 
U.S. 

Supreme 
Court 
decision 
in 

Hobby 
Lobby 
v. 
Burwell 
, 

which challenged an Affordable 
Care Act provision requiring 
employer health insurance plans 
cover contraception. 

The ruling gave employers 

the right to deny contraceptive 

health 
care 
coverage 
to 

employees if they deemed it 
against their religious beliefs.

“Common 
narratives, 

which 
have 
often 
featured 

a limited number of voices 
from within religious groups, 
have 
generalized 
opposition 

to the ACA’s provisions on 
reproductive health care across 
religious affiliations,” the paper 
stated.

Patton said she hoped to 

debunk the notion that religious 
affiliation can be used as a 
reason for opposing certain 
types of coverage. 

She said religion impacts 

women’s views in complex ways, 
and it’s important to include the 
full spectrum of women’s voices 
on the matter.

“To 
effectively 
develop 

reproductive 
health 
policies 

in this country that serve all 
women, we need to understand 
women’s — including religious 
women’s — perspectives on 
reproductive 
health 
care,” 

Patton said.

The study reported that those 

who self-identified as either 
Protestant or Catholic tended 
to believe employer health plans 
should be required to cover 
contraception. 

Additionally, 
66 
percent 

of Protestant women and 63 
percent 
of 
Catholic 
women 

surveyed supported the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care 
Act’s coverage of reproductive 
health care in general.

“We 
found 
that 
women 

had overwhelmingly positive 
attitudes 
towards 
employer 

coverage 
of 
contraception, 

regardless 
of 
religious 

affiliation,” she said.

According 
to 
Benjamin 

Hawley, priest at St. Mary’s 

Student Parish in Ann Arbor, the 
Catholic tradition opposes birth 
control because it blocks the 
possibility of new life. Even so, 
he said he said the issue should 
rest in the hands of the courts.

“Whether 
religiously-

affiliated organizations in this 
country may deny birth control 
options 
for 
employees 
and 

their families is a legal matter,” 
Hawley wrote in an e-mail. 
“Whether birth control could 
be called a legal right, restricted 
or open to all, or part of health 
insurance packages is similarly a 
matter for our political and legal 
processes. “

Abagael Adair, a master’s 

student in the School of Social 
Work, is the core organizer of 
Feminist Tables, a campus group 
that meets regularly to discuss 
relevant social issues through a 
feminist lens. 

Adair said she sees denying 

birth 
control 
and 
birth 

control coverage to women is 
discriminatory.

“All women should have equal 

access to birth control coverage 
regardless of others’ religions,” 
Adair wrote in an e-mail.

Of those surveyed, less than 

a quarter of women believed 
that 
religiously 
affiliated 

employers should be exempt 
from ACA provisions based on 
their religious beliefs. Adair 
said exemptions deny women, 
especially 
those 
of 
lower 

socioeconomic status, access to 
basic health care services.

“It is solely the choice of each 

woman whether she wants to 
utilize birth control or not,” 
Adair said. “By denying her 
coverage, the U.S. government 
is allowing women to subsidize 
their employer’s practice of 
religion.”

Elbel Field is also a popular 

location for intramural sports, 
as it includes a 100-yard turf 
football field, two sand volley-
ball courts, two softball fields, a 
picnic area and a field area. The 
University renovated the field 
in 2011 as part of an effort to 
improve its recreational sports 
facilities.

A lively, student-populated 

neighborhood, Elbel is a five 
minute walk from the Big House 
and the Intramural Sports Build-
ing. Due to its proximity to ath-
letic facilities, the neighborhood 
is popular for student-athletes.

Business 
junior 
Matt 

Kaufman, a member of the club 
water polo team, moved into 
the neighborhood because of its 
proximity to the athletic training 
facilities. Elbel is also five min-
utes from the Business School, 
so he has an easy commute to his 
business classes.

“Location was a big factor in 

choosing where I live,” Kaufman 
said. “I could not live much closer 
than where I do right now. I am 
less than five minutes away from 
class and it’s also really close to 
where my team practices.”

While the location is conve-

nient for students like Kaufman, 
Elbel is more than a 10-minute 
walk from the Diag and other 
Central Campus buildings. For 
students looking for a faster trip 
to campus, the Commuter South 
bus makes stops down Hoover 
Street.

Some students are willing to 

sacrifice location for the rela-
tively cheap rent and proximity 
for the variety of eateries, cafes 
and other local attractions on 
State Street and Main Street.

Rent in the Elbel neighbor-

hood is generally in the range 
of $600 to $700 per month, and 
can be as low as $550 per per-
son, according to data compiled 
by The Michigan Daily in 2012.

Lower-priced 
homes 
tend 

to be farther from campus. In 
homes closest to Central Cam-
pus, rent can rise to upwards of 
$800 per month per person.

Popular places to eat near 

the Elbel neighborhood include 
fast food options such as Quick-
ie Burger, Grilled Cheezerie, 
Mr. Spots and BTB Burrito, all 
located on South State Street. 
Students flock to these places 
to rejuvenate on Football Satur-
days and for late nights snacks.

Kaufman said while the State 

Street eateries are convenient, 
there is a notable lack of food 
options for the health-conscious.

“Unlike on South University, 

where you find Revive … or the 
variety of places around Main 
Street and North State Street, 
there aren’t that many places to 
get healthy food,” he said.

Even so, those looking to 

work off the 3 a.m. burger and 
fries can take advantage of the 
activities available at Elbel 
Field, the IM Building and Yost 
Arena.

Yost

The 
Yost 
neighborhood 

is 
adjacent 
to 
the 
Elbel 

neighborhood and east of South 
State Street. Like Elbel, the 
Yost 
neighborhood 
attracts 

student-athletes 
and 
cost-

conscious 
undergraduates 

because of its proximity to 
the 
University’s 
athletic 

facilities 
and 
affordability. 

The neighborhood is south of 
Packard Street and borders the 
eastern edge of South Campus.

The area is a short walk to 

the Yost Ice Arena, home to 
the Michigan hockey team. 
The arena often holds public 
skate nights for a $3 admissions 
charge.

Also like Elbel, the ice arena 

is named after a prominent 
Wolverine — former football 
coach Fielding H. Yost, who led 
the Wolverines to their first 
national championship in 1901.

Another 
reason 
why 
the 

neighborhood 
is 
brimming 

with undergraduate students 
is because of its affordable rent 
prices and lively social scene. 
Renters can expect prices as 
low as $550 per month per per-
son.

At night, Yost’s social scene 

mainly consists of house parties 
hosted 
by 
undergraduates. 

Greenwood Avenue and Mary 
Court are streets known for 
their block parties.

Like 
Elbel, 
the 
Yost 

neighborhood is located near 
the same popular State Street 
food spots, but is sometimes 
considered 
problematically 

distant from Central Campus.

For students like LSA junior 

Kelsey 
Monkiewicz 
who 

don’t need to be close to the 
athletic facilities, the location 
is a drawback. Monkiewicz 
said the two main factors 
she considered when looking 
for off-campus housing were 
proximity to Central Campus 
and affordability. While her 
living experience has met the 
latter requirement, she said 
getting to class can be a pain, 
particularly in the cold winter 
months.

“I live with athletes so the 

location is great for them, but 
my walk to class is at least 
15 minutes,” she said. “The 
buses don’t really run that 
frequently, which is especially 
inconvenient when it gets really 
cold out.”

Despite her issues with the 

distance, Monkiewicz said she 
does not mind other aspects of 
Yost, such as the frequent par-
ties. She also said she considers 
Yost a safe area to live in.

“Sometimes you can hear 

music from other houses, but 
I don’t really mind,” she said. 

“It was great to be able to 

play again after the Big Ten 
Tournament,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “I 
thought we came out of the gates 
and played exceptionally well 
— a lot of positives to take from 
tonight, but definitely happy to 
play again.”

The only true surprise came 

before the game, when junior 
guard Madison Ristovski and 
freshman 
forward 
Emoni 

Jackson started the game in 
place of sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson and senior guard 
Shannon 
Smith. 
Together, 

the duo scored 12 of the 
Wolverines’ first 16 points to 
help kick-start an offense that 
quickly built a double-digit 
lead early in the first half and 
never looked back.

From then on, the offense 

was powered by senior forward 
Cyesha Goree, who matched up 
with Cleveland State’s Alexis 
Eckles on the inside. With 
Eckles outsized by three inches, 
Goree played significantly better 
than she had at the Big Ten 

Tournament.

Despite her height advantage, 

Goree ran into trouble nearing 
the end of the first half as their 
defense keyed on her, making it 
hard to score when she felt open, 
being forced to kick the ball out 
to the guards.

“At halftime, Coach told the 

team ‘fake it and kick it,’ ” Goree 
said, “because now, everybody is 
drawing attention to me, so let’s 
get other players involved.”

One of those others included 

senior Nicole Elmblad, who 
moved to the guard position 
for the first time since last 
season. 
Regardless 
of 
the 

switch, she grabbed a game-
high 11 rebounds and eclipsed 
700 career rebounds with 708, 
becoming the 10th player in 
program history to do so.

Jackson, 
who 
had 
an 

energized first career start, 
also put in meaningful minutes 
by tacking on eight points. 
Ristovski took the bulk of the 
3-point scoring en route to 15 
points, replacing the production 
of Smith and freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty.

“(Ristovski’s) playing with a lot 

of confidence,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s playing very comfortable, 

and she’s playing really hard and 
making shots for us, which our 
other guards are really struggling 
with right now.”

Added Ristovski: “I was really 

excited. I think we all are, just 
because we’re in the postseason, 
and not that many basketball 
teams out there are still playing.”

As 
for 
Cleveland 
State’s 

offense, it never seemed to make 
it to Ann Arbor. The Vikings took 
a while to start up their engine, 
succumbing to a 20-3 Michigan 
run in the opening four minutes. 
The Wolverines scored seven 
points off 11 turnovers, and the 
2-3 zone prevented Cleveland 
State’s best scorers from making 
an impact.

Guard Cori Coleman and 

forward Imani Gordon came in 
averaging 16.1 and 16.3 points, 
respectively, but the Michigan 
defense held them to a combined 
26 points. At the start of the 
game, Gordon took nearly seven 
minutes to make a basket, while 
Coleman took 18.

“We knew they were going 

to be undersized,” Goree said. 
“It was kind of a mismatch for 
me, but at the same time you 
still have to guard them. So we 
decided to go zone and it was 

really effective.”

Cleveland State, which shot 

32.7 percent, had gone scoreless 
for eight minutes during the 
first half before making five of 
its last seven shots heading into 
halftime, including a four-point 
play from Coleman. But even the 
rejuvenated effort was futile, as 
the Wolverines prevented the 
Vikings from clawing their way 
out of a deficit.

“On the defensive end, (the 

starters) were focused on the 
game plan and did a great job,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Cleveland 
State made some adjustments 
later in the first half and kind 
of started to penetrate the zone 
a little bit, but we came out of 
the gates really focused on both 
ends.”

In the closing seconds before 

halftime, Flaherty added the 
finishing touch by stealing the 
ball for a coast-to-coast layup at 
the buzzer, making fans stand 
on their feet as the sound of 
applause overtook Crisler.

Though it had been a while, 

Michigan could finally enter the 
locker room at halftime with 
things in its favor. And they 
stayed that way.

to raise awareness for people with 
disabilities.

“They’re people, too, and they 

can do almost everything that an 
able-bodied person can,” he said.

The fraternity also organized 

a “penny war” Monday and its 
annual “Pie a Pi Kapp” event 
Tuesday, 
where 
participants 

could pay to throw a pie in the 
face of a fraternity member.

Robinson said the weeklong 

events had been successful so far, 
adding that the fraternity had 
raised over $600 from its penny 
war and Pie a Pi Kapp events.

The 
three 
events 
will 

culminate with the fraternity’s 
annual Empathy Dinner this 
Friday. Robinson said the annual 
Empathy Dinner is a meal where, 
for the first few minutes, guests 
are encouraged to show solidarity 
for people with disabilities by 
attempting to eat as though they 
are affected by various diseases, 
such as blindness or muscular 
dystrophy.

The War of the Roses is an 

event put on by Pi Kappa Phi 
chapters across the country; this 
week marks the University chap-
ter’s first time doing so.

An integral part of the War of 

the Roses is sororities’ partici-
pation. Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta 
Phi Epsilon, Zeta Tau Alpha and 
Gamma Phi Beta all partnered 
with Pi Kappa Phi this week.

Ultimately, one sorority will be 

crowned the winner of the War 
of the Roses based on multiple 
factors, including how many pen-
nies they collected for the penny 
war, the number of pies they sold 
for students to peg Pi Kappa Phi 
members with and attendance 
points for watching the wheel-
chair basketball game.

After 
accepting 
their 

invitations to participate in the 
week’s festivities, each sorority 
nominated a member to represent 
them should they win the War 
of the Roses. The winner will 
be crowned and given a sash on 
behalf of their chapter, as well 
as a portion of the money raised 
throughout the week.

The Ability Experience, Pi 

Kappa Phi’s exclusive national 
outreach project that donates 
to people with disabilities, will 
receive 75 percent of the week’s 
proceeds. The remaining will be 
given to the winning sorority’s 
philanthropy committee.

LSA sophomore Justin Stern, 

a Pi Kappa Phi member, said he 
helped Robinson to coordinate 
the War of the Roses in an effort 
to expand the chapter’s philan-
thropy efforts.

“While philanthropy was good 

last year, we thought we could 
improve it,” Stern said.

“I didn’t expect it to be this 

successful in the first year, but 
I’m really happy that it has been,” 
Robinson added. “I think that if 
we start with a base like this, that 
next year and years beyond it’ll 
only get better.”

the hypocrisy of this University” 
and its diversity policies.

“I think if we manage to 

increase minority enrollment, 
we would have less of this prob-
lem because classes would be 
more integrated and you would 
be having more of these discus-
sions (about racial issues and 
prejudice),” she said.

Wall’s 
running 
mate 
and 

LSA sophomore Katie Kennedy 
said despite living as a person 
of mixed race in Ann Arbor her 
whole life, she only felt the con-
sequence of her race when she 
became a student at the Univer-
sity.

“I had never felt so isolated 

when it came to social life, Greek 
life, academic settings, commu-
nities and the entire culture of 
the University,” she said.

LSA junior Cooper Charlton, 

Make Michigan’s presidential 
candidate, said despite being a 
“white individual,” he felt he 
understood minority popula-
tions’ struggles “through empa-
thy.”

“I can feel your passion,” he 

said. “I can understand what 
you’re trying to say and I can 
help you.”

Charlton added that the Uni-

versity’s problem lies not in 
admitting minorities, but not 
providing minority and under-
privileged 
candidates 
“the 

things they need to say ‘yes,’ ” 
like offering students financial 
aid immediately alongside their 
letter of admission.

LSA sophomore Steven Hal-

perin, Charlton’s running mate, 
shared with the audience the last 
words his father spoke to him 
before dying suddenly of a heart 
attack: “Move big rocks.” He said 
this phrase is what would drive 
him to make progress as a CSG 
executive.

“These words define me,” he 

said, adapting his life motto to fit 
the Make Michigan campaign. 

“Help us move big rocks so we 
can make the change.”

Royster 
later 
questioned 

Make Michigan’s commitment 
to race and ethnicity issues. He 
is currently the academic con-
cerns chair for the BSU, which 
launched the #BBUM campaign 
last year — he said neither Charl-
ton nor Make Michigan has 
reached out to the organization.

On this note, LSA sophomore 

Matt Fidel, The Team’s vice 
presidential candidate, said The 
Team in both its name and plat-
form is most intent on driving 
inclusion on campus.

“Inclusion is the message of 

The Team,” he said. “That is 
what we were created to inspire.”

Fidel cited the inclusive ini-

tiatives he has implemented as 
LSA representative on the CSG 
Assembly, including planning 
the police brutality speakout and 
launching a program to donate 
students’ leftover Blue Bucks 
and Dining Dollars to charity at 
the end of the semester.

Wall said increased minority 

enrollment is integral to inclu-
sion and would be best bolstered 
if the University offered on-site 
admissions in Detroit schools 
and implemented its own ver-
sion of the Texas “Top 10 Percent 
Rule.” The policy guarantees 
admission to Texas universities 
for in-state students who gradu-
ated at the top 10 percent of their 
classes. Administrators at the 
University have said that plan 
would not be feasible in Ann 
Arbor.

She added that lack of diver-

sity on college campuses is what 
leads to incidents like the one 
at the University of Oklahoma, 
where the school’s chapter of 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon was dis-
banded for leading racist chants.

In the vice presidential debate, 

Halperin referenced this point 
to promote future CSG develop-
ment of diversity education pro-
grams for students.

“I think we need to teach 

more about bystander interven-
tion,” he said.

Charlton contended that the 

creation of the CSG Honor Code, 
which current CSG President 
Bobby Dishell, a Public Poli-
cy senior, pitched earlier this 
semester, could help mitigate 
future racial tensions on campus 
and encourage students to inter-
vene in certain situations.

Royster, however, said a cul-

ture shift is the only possible 
prevention method.

When 
asked 
what 
they 

thought about the destruction 
caused by the members of Uni-
versity’s chapter of Sigma Alpha 
Mu to Treetops Resort last 
month, all of the candidates said 
they condemned the acts that 
took place. However, all three 
parties said they supported 
Greek life as a whole.

Halperin is a member of the 

University’s chapter of the Phi 
Kappa Psi fraternity; Royster 
is a member of the Univer-
sity’s chapter of the Alpha Phi 
Alpha fraternity; and Fidel was 
a member of the University’s 
chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu 
before it was disbanded by the 
fraternity’s international board 
Tuesday.

“I think it is very, very impor-

tant to note the good things 
Greek life has done,” Charlton 
said. “We all support Greek life. 
However, the fact that particu-
lar individuals can tarnish and 
influence the reputation of many 
is something that is unaccept-
able.”

Fidel, who attended the Sigma 

Alpha Mu ski trip, was asked 
about his involvement in the 
destruction.

“I condemn the ski trip whole-

heartedly,” he said. “I was not a 
part of the destruction whatso-
ever. I am not my fraternity; I am 
my own person.”

The candidates were also in 

agreement that more needs to 
be done to prevent and promote 
awareness of sexual misconduct 
on campus.

While Charlton said the pend-

ing honor code will help to pre-
vent sexual assault by providing 

a firm definition of what is right 
and wrong, Royster disagreed. 
He emphasized that other meth-
ods are necessary to induce cul-
ture shift, not just one document.

“We know what is right and 

wrong,” Royster said. “There is 
no gray area when it comes to 
sexual assault. There’s just not. 
What we need is a culture shift.”

Kennedy built on this point, 

citing a statistic that 62 percent 
of women on the University’s 
campus have reported being vic-
tims of sexual assault. She added 
that the real figure may be worse 
because most cases go unreport-
ed.

“We need to hold students 

accountable,” she said. “Rapists 
need to be expelled and charged, 
as well.”

In closing statements, all 

three presidential candidates 
reiterated their commitment to 
their individual parties and to 
diversity.

“Diversity is more than skin 

deep,” Charlton said, adding 
that diversity of thoughts and 
perspectives is also important. 
“The University of Michigan is 
where great minds come. With 
Make Michigan, we are going 
to be able to make the differ-
ence.”

Royster drew attention to 

The Team’s diverse slate of can-
didates, and said this was rep-
resentative of their ability to 
make represent a wide variety of 
demographics on campus.

“We compromised our slate 

of members from all across 
the campus. We have the most 
diverse slate that we could 
make,” Royster said. “We did 
that intentionally.”

Wall reaffirmed that she is 

running because she refuses to 
believe that no one can do any-
thing more to end the racism, 
sexism and LGBTQ issues on 
campus.

“To think that we can just 

keep our heads down until 
something changes is to sup-
port the demoralizing process,” 
she said.

I

have encountered many people 
recently who believe the gay (or 
more accurately, queer) rights 

movement 
is 

nearing its close. 
The U.S. Supreme 
Court is ruling on 
marriage equality, 
and 
America 

is 
statistically 

moving 
closer 

toward 
queer 

acceptance. 
While 
this 

certainly signals 
progress, 
we 

cannot forget that gay marriage and 
a trend toward acceptance doesn’t 
signal victory in the movement. 
We still see examples of blatant 
homophobia.

Recently, 
Lil 
Wayne 
and 

Birdman, owner of Cash Money 
Records, have feuded regarding Lil 
Wayne’s release of “Tha Carter V.” 
The rapper has cited feeling like a 
prisoner to his recording company, 
implying the delays are restricting 
his creative freedom.

Regardless 
of 
whether 
Lil 

Wayne really is a prisoner, what’s 
more noteworthy and problematic 
is 
Birdman’s 
reaction 
to 
this 

criticism. In response, Birdman 
has publicly announced that Lil 
Wayne is “a homosexual,” that all 
music detailing Lil Wayne’s sexual 
encounters with women is a façade 
to maintain his reputation, and that 
Lil Wayne has expressed sexual 
and romantic interest in Birdman, 
Rick Ross and, in particular, Drake.

Whether or not these accusations 

are 
true, 
they 
point 
to 
the 

perpetuation of same-sex attraction 
as an undesirable trait that can elicit 
shame and embarrassment.

If 
Birdman’s 
statement 
is 

true, it shows his disrespect and 
disregard for the difficulties and 
oppression 
that 
come 
from 
a 

queer identity, especially when 
considering the homophobia in 
the hip-hop community. While I 
cannot understand the experience 
of being queer and a hip-hop artist, 
rappers can provide depictions that 

certainly provide me perspective 
and empathy. For example, Angel 
Haze, a queer, female hip-hop artist 
who remixed “Same Love,” has 
gone on record saying that being 
gay in hip-hop is still stigmatized.

Additionally, T-Pain, a straight-

identifying 
hip-hop 
artist, 
has 

spoken out about the realities of 
homophobia. He also identified that 
it’s harder for queer-identifying 
artists to feature on songs, saying 
that gay-identifying artist Frank 
Ocean isn’t welcome in certain 
scenarios. “I know (artists) that will 
not do a song with Frank Ocean just 
because he is gay, but they need him 
on the fucking song.”

Given these insights into the com-

munity, I can’t imagine the difficul-
ties of Lil Wayne navigating a queer 
identity. Beside the disadvantage 
of losing work, he would have to 
continuously perpetuate a persona 
to maintain credibility. It’s a mask 
that he would have to wear proudly, 
regardless of how much this defies 
his internal desires and passions. 
And the heartache of developing 
unrequited love for your peers who 
never reciprocate must also be excru-
ciating. Developing romantic feel-
ings for your fellow artists and peers, 
only for them to continuously and 
disgustedly reject you, must strike 
a chord in the most painful manner. 
It is, without a doubt, not Birdman’s 
place to publicize this pain. His abil-
ity to frivolously out an artist dem-
onstrates homophobic undertones at 
the least, and full-blown prejudice 
against queers at worst.

However, 
there’s 
also 
the 

possibility that Lil Wayne doesn’t 
have a queer identity, and Birdman 
falsified this statement in an attempt 
to hurt his label’s artist.

If it is a lie, it’s still a portal into 

intense homophobia. Out of every 
lie Birdman could use, he landed on 
same-sex attraction. This indicates 
that he views gay-identifying people 
with a heightened level of disdain — 
perhaps even as a personification of 
evil. It’s not just an insult he could 
make up to hurt his fellow recorder, 
it’s the insult. The one with the most 

poisonous bite, the most painful 
sting. That’s unacceptable.

Birdman’s homophobia doesn’t 

exist within a vacuum in the hip-
hop community. As I’ve previously 
discussed, it’s an example of the 
systematic homophobia present in 
today’s culture. We see examples 
everywhere. Rapper and actor Lord 
Jamar used the negative connotation 
of the term “queer” to reference 
Kanye West wearing a skirt to a 
benefit concert. Even Tyler, The 
Creator, who openly advocates for 
LBGTQ rights, undermines queer-
identifying people by using the term 
“faggot” in some of his music.

Homophobia isn’t just a problem 

in the hip-hop community. Many 
subcultures contain an anti-queer 
bias. LGBTQ students in rural areas 
report less safety associated with 
revealing their identities. Religious 
communities frequently utilize their 
religious texts as a means to equate 
queer with sin. Many queer people 
of color also experience increased 
homophobia within and outside their 
ethnic communities.

These community biases come 

together to show that the queer 
movement is far from finished. 
We’re seemingly moving in the 
right direction, but there’s so 
much progress left to make besides 
legalizing gay marriage. Though 
it could be the final homophobic 
barrier for those living in accepting 
subcultures, many still exist in 
communities that are fighting for 
equal levels of respect. If Lil Wayne 
truly is gay, his sexuality is the 
root of a huge scandal and internal 
strife. If he’s not, other closeted 
and non-closeted artists are. And 
many others, particularly those in 
homophobic rural, religious and/
or ethnic communities are also 
suffering.

What 
about 
their 
lived 

experiences? 
What 
about 
the 

oppression they face? We must 
continue recognizing prejudice so we 
can continue crushing it.

Recognizing homophobia

MICHAEL
SCHRAMM

When we sing the national anthem, we sing 

its closing lines with enthusiasm and bravura, 
as though to declare their truth, “O’er the land 
of the free, and the home of the brave!” But, the 
line is actually written in the form of a ques-
tion: “O’er the land of the free, and the home of 
the brave?” And that slight change in inflection 
alters the essence of that phrase. These are not 
words to be mindlessly recited from memory, 
but something upon which to reflect, to con-
stantly ask ourselves: Is this the land of the free 
and the home of the brave?

As I read the news and as I live life on this 

college campus, I don’t know how deserving we 
are of that title, for we have distorted its mean-
ing. I see freedom to damage reputations, to 
denounce those who don’t conform. I see brav-
ery only in the masses, when the sheer numbers 
can drown out the voices of the minority. We 
cling to our ideologies so tightly because we 
are unbending in our resolves and our opinions, 
unwilling to discuss and to share and to under-
stand. We are free when we want to harm, we 
are brave when it is convenient.

Last month, Tom Schweich, a Republican 

gubernatorial candidate in Missouri, commit-
ted suicide in the midst of a nasty campaign, 
filled with cruelty and bigotry. A radio ad, 
spoken in a menacing Frank Underwood-style 
voice, announced how the opposition would 
“squash him like the little bug that he is …” And 
there are reports of a whisper campaign started 
to suggest that Schweich, a devout Episcopa-
lian, was Jewish.

Schweich was a loving husband, father of two 

and a smart and a capable statesman. In 2014, 
Schweich ran unopposed in his reelection bid 
for Missouri state auditor because Democrats 
were so impressed with his work in office. Why 
would his religion be of any importance? Would 
it prevent him from carrying out his duties? Is a 
Jew less moral or capable than a Christian? Is it 
not enough to judge a person by his merits, his 
successes, his failures and his character?

The same week Schweich took his life, a Jew-

ish student running for a student government 
position at the University of California, Los 
Angeles, was asked by a student government 
representative if her religion would prevent her 
from being an impartial representative of the 
school. The University of California, Berkeley 
student government just passed a resolution 
condemning anti-Semitism because the AEPi 
house at the University of California, Davis, 
was vandalized with swastikas last month. And 
these are just the anti-Semitic incidents. Would 
you rather talk about Ferguson? Or perhaps the 
shooting of Muslim students at the University 
of North Carolina?

This country, this land of the free and home 

of the brave, is filled with bigots, racists, sex-
ists, anti-Semites, homophobes — cowards. And 
we honor and protect the right to be a bigot, a 
racist, a sexist, an anti-Semite, a homophobe, 
a coward. I just never would have thought so 
many could indulge in such primitive behavior.

This kind of behavior isn’t tolerated in the 

world of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. Every 
so often, I watch a clip from his film “The 
American President” to remind myself of what 
America really is, or rather should be: “America 
isn’t easy,” states President Andrew Shepherd. 
“America is advanced citizenship, you’ve got to 
want it bad.”

I imagine a world according to Sorkin, where 

people carry themselves with class, ready to 
retort with a sharp wit; where harsh realities 
are faced directly; where presidents can stand 
in front of a camera and say what needs to be 
said, unfazed by approval ratings; where the 
news moves past sensationalizing and into 
delivering grounded, important information to 
its viewers.

Because in that world, when someone 

states that homosexuality is an abomination, 
you recite Exodus 21:7, “When a man sells his 
daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the 
male servants do,” followed by Exodus 35:2, “… 
Whoever does any work on (the Sabbath) shall 
be put to death,” and then you kindly ask that 
bigot to at least be consistent with his doctrines. 
In that world, when you learn that a female 
coworker is being harassed, you storm into the 
harasser’s office, question him about integrity 
and fire him. In that world, when someone 
asks, “Why is America the greatest country in 
the world?” you don’t answer with “freedom 
and democracy,” but with a rejection of such a 
simple notion and instead look at the reality of 
the state of the nation, and then you ask what 
you can do to make it better. In that world, there 
are men and women who stand up for charac-
ter, for values, not because it’s to their benefit, 
but because someone has to, because it’s right.

And yes, Sorkin’s world is often flawed; it 

can drag at times, it can moralize too much, 
its characters, oftentimes women, can be ditzy 
and poorly written. But eventually, when that 
world finds its footing, it can deliver something 
inspiring, something honorable — an idea of 
how things could be.

We are so far away from that world. Because 

in our world, we stigmatize those who believe 
something different from us — we respond 
with rumors, with vandalism, with hatred. We 
stick our hands into the filth, wrap them in tape 
colored red, white and blue and throw boxing 
gloves over them. We ask our fellow man to step 
into the ring and take the next beating because 
he who is not with me is against me.

We choose to look away from the brutal-

ity of it all. We elect officials who perpetuate 
secrecy or ignorance or sheer stupidity because 
it’s what we know. The cycle continues, and we 
wonder why things aren’t getting better.

In the film, Andrew Shepherd continues, 

“You want to claim this land as the land of the 
free? Then the symbol of your country cannot 
just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of 
its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag 
in protest. Now show me that, defend that, cel-
ebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can 
stand up and sing about the land of the free.” 
Aaron Sorkin knows that. I believe Tom Sch-
weich knew that.

For so long, we have sung of the land of the 

free and the home of the brave; now we need 
to live by those words, even when it hurts, even 
when the blood boils so hot with rage. Then, 
we will become what Sorkin, through Josiah 
Bartlett in “The West Wing,” envisions:

“But every time we think we have measured 

our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and 
we’re reminded that that capacity may well be 
limitless. This is a time for American heroes. 
We will do what is hard. We will achieve what 
is great. This is a time for American heroes and 
we reach for the stars.”

I lament that there are no President Shep-

herds or Bartlets, there are no Will McAvoys or 
CJ Craigs. Maybe the world is too complicated 
for men and women like them. Maybe the very 
idea that I have spent over 1,200 words compar-
ing life to a TV show is childish and naïve. But 
sometimes we need an ideal to strive toward, 
to march boldly with our eyes open and our 
heads high. Because if we can achieve that, Tom 
Schweich will not have died in vain, Ferguson 
will not have erupted for nothing, hatred will 
cease to needlessly perpetuate. This is a call not 
for change, but for introspection. We need to 
embrace what we already know to be true, that 
which is sewn into the very fabric of the Ameri-
can flag: that we are free and we are brave, and 
we can accomplish so much more.

Pushing past history

ANNA POLUMBO-LEVY | EDITORIAL BOARD VIEWPOINT

Since the introduction of the 

new AP U.S. History curriculum in 
2012, there has been a fierce wave 
of opposition to it. In August 2014, 
the Republican National Commit-
tee adopted a resolution stating 
that the new APUSH curriculum 
is a “radically revisionist view of 
(American) history that emphasiz-
es negative aspects of our nation’s 
history while omitting or minimiz-
ing positive aspects.”

Many conservative activists and 

lawmakers have expressed their 
concern about the course, saying 
that it focuses too much on the 
negative aspects of American his-
tory and that it is “rife with anti-
American biases.” On February 16, 
2015, the Oklahoma House Com-
mon Education Committee passed 
an amendment to House Bill 1380 in 
an 11-to-4 vote that would defund 
the College Board’s AP US His-
tory course in its revised form. The 
author of the amendment, Rep. Dan 
Fisher (R–Okla.), said that “rede-
sign of this new framework trades 
an emphasis on America’s founding 
principles of constitutional govern-
ment in favor of robust analysis of 
gender, racial oppression, class and 
ethnicity in the lives of marginal-
ized people.”

Fisher also said the AP course’s 

“emphasis of instruction is on 
America as a nation of oppressors 
and exploiters.” In the amendment, 
Fisher lists specific people and doc-
uments — such as Martin Luther 
King Jr. and the Bill of Rights — 
that he believes should be integral 
parts of the AP curriculum. Fisher 
argues that great people and impor-
tant documents are being put to the 
side and substituted with histori-
cal events that highlight America’s 
shortcomings. He’s saying we need 
to portray America in a more posi-
tive light.

Despite the fact that Fisher with-

drew the amendment to rewrite 
House Bill 1380 shortly after it 
passed, due to national criticism, 
the conversation is far from over. 
The bill had originally passed over-

whelmingly in the aforementioned 
Oklahoma House Common Edu-
cation Committee, which speaks 
to a widespread belief in the bill’s 
principles. In fact, legislators in 
states such as Colorado, South 
Carolina, North Carolina, Geor-
gia and Texas think the AP course 
focuses too much on America’s 
“blemishes” and are considering 
moves to ban or alter the course. 
Similarly, in Kansas, legislators are 
moving to ban any course not cre-
ated in-state, which would include 
APUSH. In this way, legislators and 
members of other political bodies 
are attempting to assert more con-
trol over the curriculum and force 
schools to teach what they want to 
be taught.

While it’s important to highlight 

the positive aspects of American 
history, I disagree that the new 
APUSH curriculum is highlight-
ing negative aspects of history over 
more positive aspects. In fact, I 
believe we are still struggling to 
accept the dark moments in our 
past that continue to affect our 
future. Too often, we attempt to 
silence parts of history we aren’t 
proud of, and when we speak of 
them, they’re not discussed as 
systemic, long-term issues, but 
 

rather “blemishes.”

I grew up in a very progressive 

part of California — the Bay Area 
— and went to very liberal schools 
in Oakland and San Francisco my 
entire life. It was only in my senior 
year of high school that I had 
learned anything of substance about 
the widespread eugenic practices in 
America — and especially California 
— that weren’t formally outlawed 
 

until 1979.

I agree that we must highlight 

important figures such as Martin 
Luther King Jr., and we must rec-
ognize the contributions of the 
Founding Fathers. However, we 
must equally highlight aspects 
of our history such as Japanese 
internment and the brutal enslave-
ment of and discrimination against 
African Americans. History isn’t 

just listing important figures and 
documents; it’s about analyzing our 
past with a critical eye. We cannot 
talk about MLK’s famous speech, 
which Fisher wanted to add to the 
AP curriculum, without addressing 
the fact that racial oppression and 
marginalization were the reasons 
for it. We cannot discuss the con-
tributions of the Founding Fathers 
without pointing out the ways in 
which their policies favored white 
men of European ancestry. We 
cannot replace the darker parts of 
history or we risk misinterpret-
ing history entirely and becoming 
ignorant to the harsh realities of 
America’s past.

The reason APUSH emphasizes 

“gender, racial oppression, class 
and ethnicity in the lives of mar-
ginalized people,” is that they are 
integral parts of American his-
tory we cannot forget. In fact, the 
settlement of America, and the 
creation of America by Europeans 
was largely a product of oppres-
sion and marginalization of vari-
ous racial groups. Today, less than 
three percent of Fortune 500 com-
panies are headed by women, Afri-
can American’s are nearly six times 
more likely to be incarcerated than 
whites and poverty rates among 
African Americans and Latinos 
are two to three times higher than 
among 
whites. 
Ignoring 
these 

issues will only exacerbate the ten-
sions between different ethnic and 
racial groups in society, and further 
marginalize the plights of the many 
minorities that make up America.

My intention is not be anti-

American. But by having these hard 
discussions, and recognizing the 
problems of our past that carry over 
to today, we can improve society 
moving forward. By pointing out 
the mistakes in a country’s history, 
we are molding our nation for a bet-
ter future. No country has a perfect 
history, and it is crucial that we 
 

acknowledge it.

There are 33.3 million 

Irish-Americans living in 

the United States.

2.

Ireland did not have a St. 
Patrick’s Day parade until 

1931 in Dublin.

3. 

Saint Patrick was not

March 17 in honor of the 

date of his death.

8. 

Saint Patrick is said to have

Spirit.

9. 

Until the 1970’s, all pubs in 
Ireland were forced closed

Michigan opens Big Ten 
tourney under pressure

Wolverines need 

three wins, starting 

with Wisconsin 

on Thursday

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

is in an all-too familiar position 
heading into this weekend’s Big 
Ten Tournament.

Holding the third seed, the 

Wolverines (12-8 Big Ten, 20-14 
overall) will be pitted against No. 
6 seed Wisconsin (2-15-3-2, 4-25-
5) in Thursday’s opening-round 
matchup. Michigan holds the 
4-0 season series lead over the 
Badgers, but it would be a mistake 
to tread lightly against a team 
that hasn’t enjoyed much, if any, 
success during the regular season.

That’s because the postseason 

gives everyone a clean slate. 
Seeds don’t matter, stats don’t 
matter and records don’t matter.

“They’re 
dangerous,” 
said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“They’ll be as dangerous as any 
team in the tournament.”

One year ago, the Wolverines 

entered the Big Ten Tournament 
as the No. 3 seed, playing No. 
6 seed Penn State. They lost 
a heartbreaker, 2-1, in double 
overtime. Their season ended 
that same day, as their NCAA 
Tournament hopes were dashed 
in 
the 
most 
gut-wrenching 

fashion.

Two years ago, after a lousy 

regular season, Michigan needed 
to win the CCHA Tournament 
in order to earn an NCAA 
Tournament berth. It marched 
all the way to the finals, but fell 
just short, losing to Notre Dame 

by a score of 3-1.

And now the Wolverines enter 

their 
conference 
tournament 

with much work to do for a third 
straight year. They cannot afford 
to falter in Thursday’s opening 
round, and they cannot afford to 
lose in the championship game 
if they do advance that far. It’s 
a 
three-game 
weekend, 
and 

Michigan has to win them all if it 
hopes to snap a two-year absence 
from the NCAA Tournament.

“I think this weekend can 

make or break your season,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson.

Wisconsin doesn’t do anything 

particularly well, but neither 
did the Nittany Lions a season 
ago. The Badgers rank among 
the nation’s 10 worst programs 
in team offense, team defense, 
penalty killing and power-play 
percentage.

“You look at them where they 

ended up in the standings, and I’m 
sure they’re not too happy with 
themselves,” Motte said. “But that 
can be turned around real quick. 
It’s a short season now.”

Michigan, meanwhile, boasts 

the nation’s top-ranked offense, 
a unit scoring an average of 3.88 
goals per game this season. It also 
holds the third-ranked power-
play 
unit, 
converting 
24.79 

percent of the time with the man 
advantage.

This week in practice, the 

Wolverines have focused on 
defense, just as they have all 
season. 

The 
losses 
Michigan 
has 

suffered this season are often a 
result of its porous defensive play 
and slow, uninspired starts. The 
teams that have the best chance 
at beating the Wolverines play 
a slow, grinding style of play 
that can bring their high-octane 
offense to a screeching halt.

And even though Michigan 

has beaten the Badgers four times 
this season, Wisconsin stands as 
a team that has the ability to pull 
off an upset.

“We kind of know what to 

expect out of them — hard-
working team, disciplined, they’ll 
stay in shooting lanes, they’ll 
block shots, they’ll put it on the 
line every night,” said sophomore 
forward Tyler Motte.

Beating a team three times in 

the same season is challenging, 
and beating a team four times 
is extremely impressive, but 
beating a team for a fifth time is 
almost unheard of.

The 
Wolverines’ 
NCAA 

Tournament hopes are hanging 
on the hope that they can do 
it, though. They’ll need to put 
together a three-game winning 
streak over the weekend — 
something they haven’t done 
since the end of February.

Disposing of the Badgers early 

and never letting off the gas are 
keys to success that Berenson will 
be relaying to his team during 
Wednesday’s team meeting in 
Detroit.

“We’ve got to be really ready, 

lights out, in the first period,” 
he said. “That’s going to be our 
message, and I think they’ll 
follow up with that with good 
team talk in the locker room. 
Now, you got to go out and do it.”

The 
coaching 
staff 
was 

more stoic than usual after 
Wednesday’s practice at Yost 
Ice Arena. They and the players 
know about high stakes. They 
know they’re entering a new 
season where a loss means more 
than it did a week ago.

It means their season might 

be over, and they know they can’t 
stomach another season that 
ends too soon.

New lineup equals fresh start

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Writer

All season long, the Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

starting lineup has featured 
four permanent starters and one 
revolving door in the fifth spot.

But after a 3-6 finish to the 

regular season and a loss to 
Michigan State in the Big Ten 
Tournament 
that 
knocked 

the Wolverines off the NCAA 
Tournament bubble, Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico blew 
the lineup wide open to begin the 
WNIT.

In the Wolverines’ tournament 

opener 
against 
Cleveland 

State, a 72-50 victory at Crisler 
Center, three guards who are 
typically fixtures in the starting 
lineup — senior Shannon Smith, 
sophomore Siera Thompson and 
freshman Katelynn Flaherty — 
began the game on the bench 
in favor of sophomore guard 
Danielle Williams, junior guard 
Madison Ristovski and freshman 
forward Emoni Jackson.

It was the first start of Jackson’s 

career, and the first time all season 
that Smith and Thompson have 
been absent from the starting five.

“I think that sometimes, as 

coaches, you kind of get a little 
nervous to change things, and 
you kind of get comfortable in 
a set way,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Shannon and Siera and even 
Katelynn a little bit are kind 
of still stuck. They didn’t play 
exceptionally well our last two 
regular-season games, and they 
need to get back out of it.

“If we want to win this 

championship, we need those 
three — our three starting 
guards — to play at the same level 
everybody else is playing at right 
now.”

Still, it may have initially 

seemed counterproductive for 
Michigan to keep its first-, third- 
and fourth-leading scorers on the 
bench. But their replacements 
quickly proved that maybe a little 
bit of change was just what the 
Wolverines needed.

Picking up where she left 

off with her last two games of 
the regular season, Ristovski 
provided a boost for a Michigan 
offense that shot 44.3 percent 

from the floor but turned the ball 
over 13 times. Ristovski finished 
as the game’s second leading 
scorer, tallying 15 points on the 
strength of three 3-pointers.

Jackson added eight points 

of her own and exhibited her 
ability to play off the glass — she 
successfully converted multiple 
contested bank shots and grabbed 
four rebounds.

Williams isn’t a scorer by trade 

— she averages only one point and 
scored just two on Wednesday — 
but she made her presence felt as 
part of a 2-3 zone defense that 
completely neutralized Cleveland 
State. The Vikings barely made a 
quarter of their shots in the first 
half and didn’t reach a double-
digit point total until 17 minutes 
into the game.

“I was really excited to be out 

there myself,” Ristovski said, “but 
for Emoni and Danielle and for 
all of us to get the opportunity to 
start the game — we were just so 
excited to just talk to each other 
and come out and set the tone 
really early.”

The change of pace didn’t just 

affect the players moving in and 
out of the starting lineup — it was 
a desperately needed fresh start 
after the Wolverines’ debilitating 
conference tournament loss to 

the Spartans two weeks ago.

“It took a while (to get over 

the loss),” said senior forward 
Cyesha Goree. “But once we 
came back, we knew we had a lot 
of work to do. Everybody really 
committed to being checked in, 
focused on being able to still do 
something that hasn’t been done 
yet. A WNIT championship (for 
Michigan) has not been done yet. 
There’s no reason to hang your 
head right now, because you still 
can do something great for this 
program.”

No 
one 
embodied 
that 

mentality more than the team’s 
new starters. Ristovski, Williams 
and Jackson rarely share the floor 
together during games, but they 
injected some new life into a team 
that had been struggling with 
inconsistency for over a month.

“Change, I feel like, always 

makes a difference,” Ristovski 
said. “It kind of shakes everyone 
up, and it forces certain players 
to excel at their game and play 
better because they want more 
minutes. It gives opportunities 
to other kids to get them really 
excited to be out there.

“Sometimes change just makes 

you play better because you know 
you have the opportunity to 
continue to play.”

‘M’ downs Bowling Green

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Falcons 
of 
Bowling 

Green were served as a midweek 
appetizer 
for 
the 
Michigan 

softball 
team 
on 

Wednesday 
at Alumni Field, just a few days 
before the beginning of Big Ten 
competition.

The Wolverines (25-4) batted 

through the lineup in the first 
inning, garnering five hits and a 
three-run lead. Freshman first 
baseman Tera Blanco delivered 
a 
single 
that 
scored 
junior 

centerfielder Sierra Lawrence. 
A 
groundout 
by 
freshman 

designated player Amanda Vargas 
allowed junior second baseman 
Sierra Romero to come home from 
third and firmly established an 
upper hand for Michigan.

The Wolverines, who won by 

a score of 8-1, were one run short 
of winning via run-rule in the 
bottom of the fifth inning before 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
began a series of substitutions 
in order to get more players 
meaningful in-game experience.

“We got a chance to get a lot 

of kids some playing time, and 
that’s a good day,” Hutchins said. 
“You never know when they’re 
going to be somebody you have 
to count on. If you get a lead, 
you want to give them a chance 
to play because they want their 
opportunity. I thought they did a 
great job.”

With an 8-1 lead in the 

bottom of the fifth inning, junior 
outfielders Mary Sbonek and 
Olivia Richvalsky pinch-hit for 
the big bats of junior left fielder 
Kelli Christner and Romero, the 
beginning of several position 
changes on both sides of the ball 
that gave the fans at Alumni Field 
a look at some of the Wolverines’ 
less-familiar faces.

Before the substitutions began 

en masse, Christner and Romero 
hit back-to back home runs to 
right-center field in the bottom 
of the fourth inning. Christner’s 
homer scored Lawrence and was 
Christner’s sixth longball of the 
year.

Romero’s solo shot extended 

Michigan’s run total to eight and 
gave the slugger 11 dingers so far.

“I was telling (Christner) how 

last weekend, after she hit that 
home run against Kent State, 
that I wanted to hit a home run 
against Kent State and I popped 
up,” Romero said. “I was like, ‘See 
I can’t do that, I can’t try to hit it 
out.’”

Against the Falcons, Michigan 

seemed to have resolved many of 
the issues that had been nagging 
during the Kent State series, 
where the Wolverines suffered a 
rare loss. Wednesday, Michigan 
recorded 12 hits and zero errors 
in addition to the eight runs.

In five innings of work, senior 

left-hander Haylie Wagner was 
just short of superb, picking up 
the win in her first start since 
Saturday’s loss.

A first-inning triple and a deep 

home run blast to the top of the 
center-field bleachers in the top 
of the third inning were the only 
hits and runs allowed by Wagner.

“I wasn’t trying to rush 

anything, just stay relaxed,” 
Wagner said. “I have been a lot 
tighter when I go out there, so 
that’s what I’ve been working on. 
My confidence and our confidence 
is going to be great, and we’re 
excited for the Big Ten.”

ROBERT DUNNE/Daily

Senior left-hander Haylie Wagner turned in five strong innings, allowing only one run on a third-inning home run.

A New Road for Detroit:

The Ann Arbor Film Fest 
returns to Michigan Theater 
for it’s 53rd year

» INSIDE

Film Fest:

Redevelopment prompts tough questions

By Adam Theisen, Senior Arts Editor


2B — Thursday, March 19, 2015
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

When I was growing up in the 

suburbs of Detroit, I and other 
young kids in schools learned a 
very clear, simple narrative about 
the city. Henry Ford and the Model 
T created a thriving metropolis 
with architecture that garnered 
it the moniker “The Paris of the 
West,” whose factory workers 
earned a good wage and supplied 
the U.S. with the tanks, jeeps and 
planes it needed to win World War 
II. However, growing racial ten-
sions led to “The Riots” of 1967 
and an outpouring of white people 
from the city into the growing 
suburbs. After that, we learned, 
Detroit descended into economic 
chaos and physical ruin.

As much as people might try 

to explain Detroit, the diversity 
of narratives within the sprawl-
ing city make it truly impossible 
to tell one unified story about its 
rise, fall or potential recovery. 
The 143 square miles that make up 
the city contain some of the most 
dynamic and complex space in the 
country, and to try to fit the his-
tory of Michigan’s most populous 
city under any kind of universal 
umbrella narrative will inevitably 
distort the truth. Henry Ford was 
scarily anti-Semitic, racist vio-
lence disrupted the war effort and 
made factories dangerous places 
for Black residents to work and the 
“white flight” narrative typically 
forgets the fact that there were 
and are many strong, solidly mid-
dle-class neighborhoods within 
Detroit’s borders.

Lately, the narrative we’ve all 

been hearing about Detroit has 
been a comeback story. Billionaire 
Dan Gilbert and other investors 
are buying up and renovating doz-
ens of properties downtown, the 
Detroit Red Wings are getting a 
new arena and a weekend night out 
in the city will put you in the com-
pany of hundreds of young people 
having fun at the wealth of new 
nightlife options.

However, many problems still 

linger in The Motor City, espe-
cially for those who live outside 
the revitalized Downtown and 
Midtown areas. It was less than 
two years ago that Detroit filed for 
bankruptcy, and only one year ago 
that the city shut off water for resi-
dents who couldn’t pay their bills.

Additionally — and perhaps 

most troublingly for the long-term 
future — groups and programs 
that work to revitalize Detroit 
have a significantly white make-
up, according to researcher Alex 
Hill, despite the city overall being 
82.7-percent Black or African-
American at the time of the 2010 
census. “In Detroit problems are 
seen as being caused by black 
people, but the solutions are being 
powered by white people, neither 
of which are true,” Hill stated in 
his report.

The unequal racial demograph-

ics that make up Detroit’s elite 
decision makers is what origi-
nally inspired Detroit community 
developer Lauren Hood to engage 
herself more in social justice in 
Detroit.

“People that look like me weren’t 

involved in all of the revitalization 
efforts,” Hood said. “At the com-
munity level, yes, there were tons 
of long-term residents and tons of 
people of color at those meetings, 
but when you get to the decision-
making meetings with power 
players, people that have money, 
developers, there were never any, 
or very few, native Detroiters and 
black people in that picture.”

Hood’s organization, Deep Dive 

Detroit, 
spearheads 
discussion 

sessions and other events where 
native Detroiters of all different 
backgrounds can talk about race, 
inequality and other social justice-
related topics. These events ampli-

fy the voices of longtime Detroit 
residents and people who are 
involved in the community, those 
whose stories are often passed 
over and go unheard in favor of 
young recent arrivals to the city.

Aaron Foley, a Detroit-based 

writer and journalist, noticed that 
the influx of young people and the 
changing population of the city 
can create some tricky situations. 
His upcoming book, “How to Live 
in Detroit Without Being a Jack-
ass,” is meant to show newcomers 
how to avoid hurting or offending 
longtime residents.

“Detroit is definitely open for 

new residents, new businesses, hot 
new locations and whatnot,” Foley 
said. “But because there’s so much 
history — you got race and class 
and social and economic status — a 
lot of people trip over these things, 
and it can be awkward for people.”

Hood said the audience for 

Deep Dive Detroit’s events is often 
these new arrivals: young people 
curious about social justice.

“(The people who come) are 

kind of conscious and aware. 
They’re not really sure how they 
want to get involved in helping 
move the needle towards equity, 
but they know that they should,” 
Hood said. “I know a lot of people 
would come into the room and be 
like, ‘Ha, look at all these young 
hipsters,’ but at least these hipsters 
are in a room where they’re going 
to learn something that could 
actually help move the needle a 
little bit, ’cause there are others 
who don’t even think they need to 
hear these stories, or don’t want to 
be involved and don’t care, ’cause 
they don’t have to be to be success-
ful here.”

The main area where these 

two disparate groups — longtime 
Detroiters, often people of color; 
and typically white young people 
who have just moved to the city — 
don’t see eye to eye, according to 
Hood, is in access to opportunity. 
Longtime minority residents can 
get passed over for jobs and grants 
in favor of white outsiders.

“If you’re a person who just got 

here and suddenly you find access 
to all this grant funding and all 
these other people that are doing 
things and getting notoriety for it 
and getting funding for it, if you 
just got here and you see that, 
you’re like, ‘Well, why haven’t 
these people that’ve been here 
been doing this all this time?’ ” 
Hood said.

“If I had just got here and I went 

to a certain kind of school and 
spoke a certain way and looked a 
certain way, I could have access to 
a lot of funding for projects,” she 
continued. “But if I’ve been here 
in the trenches doing the same 
kind of work for years and years 
and years, I’m not as likely to have 
access to or be awarded funding.”

When decision-making groups 

lack diversity, they can’t fully 
understand their area; the money 
they spend can end up dispropor-
tionately benefiting small groups 
of privileged people. The M1 Rail 
Line, a streetcar system funded by 
private investors that’s currently 
under construction on Woodward 
Avenue, will only serve a small 
percentage of Detroit’s residents. 
While a city and its businesses’ 
investments should certainly tar-
get visitors in addition to residents, 
some Detroiters are skeptical 
that the M1 Rail is the best use of 
money for their city.

“I definitely wish that more of 

that money could have been used 
towards the bus system,” Foley 
said. “It’s not that I’m against the 
M1 Rail … (but) you have that ques-
tion mark of how far it’s going to 
go … Why couldn’t we have spread 
that money out?”

“Maybe it’s the backbone of a 

larger system that will grow out of 
it hopefully, but I don’t know, the 
current plans don’t excite me that 
much,” Hood said.

And while city officials point 

to progress since the bankruptcy 
in areas such as police response 
times, these changes may only be 
affecting areas like Midtown and 
Downtown. Many longtime Black 
middle-class residents — a major 
tax base for city — are leaving for 
the suburbs due to a lack of safety 
in their neighborhoods (including 
Hood’s parents).

“Response times are better if 

you’re in Midtown and Corktown. 
If you are on the East Side, they 
still won’t come to your house,” 
Hood said. “When my parents 
got held up, Channel 4 News 
was there before the police were 
there.”

There’s also a sense that 

Detroiters 
don’t 
necessarily 

need all the help that outsiders 
are offering.

“People treat Detroit now like 

a place you go for Peace Corps,” 
Hood said. “Like you’re just 
going to go there, create some 
project that will help a few peo-
ple, and then you leave and go to 
the next thing.”

So what does need improve-

ment? 
One 
answer 
that 
is 

regularly mentioned is commu-
nity benefits agreements. These 
agreements 
would 
require 

developers and businesses using 
public money to agree with the 
community on certain condi-
tions, such as hiring a major-
ity of local workers. While these 
agreements have faced opposi-
tion in the Michigan Legisla-
ture, they have support in the 
community.

“As long as that gets people 

working, so we can all get back 
on our feet here, that’s definitely 
a benefit,” Foley said.

George Galster, professor of 

urban affairs at Wayne State 
University, 
proposes 
another 

solution. While he thinks a 
type of community benefits 
agreement is appropriate for 
developers who use substan-
tial public money, he cautioned 
against “killing the goose that

Peace Corps.”

lays the golden eggs” by attach-
ing too many strings to develop-
ments.

“It’s very tricky, because the 

climate in Detroit is still very ten-
uous,” Galster said. “There are 
not a lot of deals that can be done 
for developers that are all that 
attractive, so I think the city has 
to be very careful in how much it 
tries to extract from developers.”

Hood disagrees that business-

es wouldn’t come if restrictions 
were too tight.

“That’s bullshit,” she said. 

“We’re hot right now. Have you 
read all the articles? We don’t 
need the people that wouldn’t 
come here. Keep them. I think 
enough people would still come 
here with one.”

Galster says the key thing 

Michigan needs to do is institute 
an urban growth boundary, 
which 
would 
contain 
new 

construction within high-density 
areas to “stop sprawl in its tracks” 
and force developers to use 
vacant land or older structures 
in Detroit. This boundary would 
create a more compact city, one 
with a reduced carbon footprint 
that can be more easily served by

public transportation.

One thing for sure: Detroiters 

think the necessity for action has 
become much greater than it was 
even just a few years ago.

“In 2012, in talking to people, 

there wasn’t the sense of urgency 
there is now,” Hood said. “People 
are like, ‘Oh my God we have to do 
something now,’ whereas maybe 
a couple of years ago people were 
like, ‘You know, we’re going to 
have some issues in the future 
— prices are going to go up, new 
people are going to be coming in, 
there’s going to be some displace-
ment,’ but now there’s this sense of 
urgency about it.”

Detroiters also want to be sure 

that what they love about their 
city stays the same.

“We have a lot of power in this 

moment,” Hood said. “We just 
have to harness it and move it in a 
different direction. We don’t want 
to turn into Brooklyn, or Oakland 
or D.C.”

And despite the remaining 

problems and uncertainty about 
the city’s prospects, Detroiters 
are proud of their city and mostly 
upbeat about potential solutions. 
Galster, a fifth-generation Detroi-

ter, said he has “the best job in the 
United States,” and still lives in the 
city.

“I think it’s important to vote 

with your feet, if you will, to try to 
be part of the solution that you’re 
talking about in your classes and 
in your studies,” he said. “I feel 
very, very fortunate at this oppor-
tunity to do what I like doing best 
in the place that I care about the 
most.”

In his essay “We love Detroit, 

Even 
If 
You 
Don’t,” 
Foley 

described his feelings for the 
city as “a twisted love that runs 
the gamut of emotions: Joy, dis-
appointment, hurt, anger, fear, 
elation, delight, apprehension, 
courage, resentment, cynicism, 
stubbornness, 
optimism 
and 

confusion.” And though he has 
thought about moving in the 
past, Foley said that desire has 
lessened lately, and he’s opti-
mistic for the future.

“Now you can sort of see the 

light at the end of the tunnel, 
and I want to be there to see 
the light,” he said. “I can see 
the future. I can see things are 
finally coming along, and I want 
to be a part of it.”

53rd Ann Arbor Film 
Fest keeps its charm

By KATHLEEN DAVIS

Senior Arts Editor

Every year for the past 53 years, 

mid-March brings a change in the 
air for the city of Ann Arbor. It’s 
not due to the first breaks of spring 
that melt the snow, or the mix of 
dread and excitement that comes 
with the end of the scholastic year. 
This March, like the 52 before it, 
film aficionados flood to the city to 
celebrate the oldest experimental 
film festival in the United States, 
the Ann Arbor Film Festival, 
housed downtown at the Michi-
gan Theater.

Established in 1963 by George 

Manupelli, a former University 
professor, the festival has a long 
and impressive history of artists 
and filmmakers brought to Ann 
Arbor. Ahead of its time, the fes-
tival showcased early work by big 
names like George Lucas, Yoko 
Ono and Gus Van Sant, and can 
boast an appearance by Andy War-
hol and the Velvet Underground 
and Nico in 1966. Manupelli, who 
passed away in September 2014, 
will be honored at this year’s festi-
val with an exposition of his early 
art as well as with a showing of one 
of his early films, accompanied by 
a live musical performance.

Executive 
Director 
Leslie 

Raymond and Program Direc-
tor David Dinnell have both been 
involved with the festival for quite 
a while. Raymond has been execu-
tive director for a year and a half, 
but has been involved with the 
festival since 1991, when she began 
as an intern. Dinnell has been pro-
gramming for the festival for the 
past seven years, and both are very 
familiar with the process of estab-
lishing a firm lineup each year.

The screening process for the 

festival begins with an open call 
to artists, available to anyone who 
has made an experimental film 
in the past two years. This pre-
liminary process goes from July to 
November the year before the fes-
tival, which are then viewed by 20 
volunteer screeners and reviewed 
multiple times in a narrowing pro-
cess. The films come from about 30 

countries, with the United States 
sending the most, but with many 
pieces coming from Europe and, 
increasingly, South America and 
Asia.

“I think the festival has really 

grown internationally and we’re 
seeing more and more works com-
ing from abroad, which has been 
really interesting,” Dinnel said.

Submissions 
have 
increased 

from 300 to 3,000 since the accep-
tance of digital film mediums 
starting at the 42nd AAFF. The fes-
tival also features artist retrospec-
tives, a revisiting of early works 
by experimental filmmakers who 
have made a lasting impression on 
the field. This year’s festival will 
include the first ever North Ameri-
can retrospective of Polish film-
maker Wojciech Bakowski, as well 
as Tacita Dean.

“We take into consideration 

that the festival is a week-long 
event, so we include some historic 
work but most is contemporary,” 
Dinnel said. “The historic works 
that we do feature allow someone 
to deepen their appreciation for 
historical precedent.”

The festival is very integrated 

into the Ann Arbor community, 
relying heavily on local volunteers 
to keep it together each year. There 
is also a current and historical con-
nection between the University 
and the festival, beginning with its 
creation by Manupelli.

“It’s very much a community 

organization,” Dinnel said. “That 
has helped the festival not only 
survive, but foster over the past 
decades due to a lot of community 
support. People who live in town 
really value the organization so 
they’re willing to help us out every 
year in various years.”

“The festival has relationships 

throughout the University, with 
the Stamps school, the Depart-
ment of Screen Arts and Cultures 
is a natural fit and we’ve had a very 
longstanding relationship with 
them,” Raymond added.

In the past five decades, there 

has been much room for change, 
yet the festival has maintained a 
sense of familiarity in its dedica-

tion to showcasing the top experi-
mental films of the time. Arguably 
the biggest change in its history 
was the expansion of accepting 
films other than 16mm, which was 
the only accepted platform until 
the 42nd festival.

“(16mm) was a medium readily 

available to artists, and the 1960s 
were really a heyday of artist-
made, avant-garde film because 
of it,” Raymond said. “It started 
to become apparent in around the 
late ’80s that maybe it was time to 
open up to video. It allowed the 
festival to remain contemporary, 
to look at work being made in a 
contemporary medium by contem-
porary artists.”

The current prevalence of digi-

tal media has changed, for many, 
what constitutes a film view-
ing experience. The festival is a 
reminder of the beauty of viewing 
a film in the way it began, in a the-
ater.

“With the advent of digital 

tools, the Internet has allowed art-
ists to readily share their work on 
YouTube or other platforms,” Din-
nell said. “We find ourselves really 
thinking about what it means to go 
with a couple friends on a Thurs-
day or Friday night and sit in the 
Michigan Theater with hundreds 
and hundreds of other people and 
give your attention fully over to 
what’s on the screen.”

“We appreciate that that’s a 

completely different experience 
than just watching a 10-minute 
film that somebody shares that 
you click on a link to watch. 
It’s a fundamentally different 
experience even if that work is 
the same work,” Dinnel added. 
“It’s almost like listening to 
something on your iPod and then 
listening to it live in a concert 
hall. There’s a real energy that 
happens when you’re watching 
film, giving it your full attention 
and sitting with hundreds of 
other people, and the image is 20 
feet tall with an amazing sound 
system.”

“The scale and the social 

context still remain essential 
and important,” Raymond said.

SINGLE REVIEW

Start with a beat – sure and 

steady. Then layer in lyrics, 
the first of which being 
“Everything 
I’ve 
ever 

known 
is 

wrong,” 
mask 
them 

with 
the 

driving 
beat and an 
angelic tone 
of 
voice. 

The 
result 

is a juxtaposition of sound 
– the kind of thing listeners 
absentmindedly sing along to 
before taking a closer look at 
the meaning – in the form of 
“Entropy,” a collaboration of 
Grimes and Bleachers.

The unusual duo teamed 

for 
a 
feature 
on 
HBO’s 

“Girls,” and the track has 
now been released in full. 
Reaching a stable middle 
ground, the track does not 
play too heavily on Grimes’s 
electronic background nor on 
Bleachers’ indie-rock sound.

Instead, 
Jack 
Antonoff, 

previously 
of 
fun., 
uses 

choppy guitar strokes and 
sporadic bursts of drumming 
to replace what could have 
been 
entirely 
synthesized 

beats. 
Grimes 
provides 

the 
vocals, 
transcending 

the 
seemingly 
two-

dimensional space of music 
by weaving in and out of the 
instrumentation 
with 
her 

signature, echoing tone.

The track blossoms into 

something 
equally 
quirky 

and catchy as it plays on, 
drawing listeners in with a 
pop-like structure and lyrics 
of ill-fated relationships. But 
just as quickly as it began, the 
layers begin to dissolve and 
listeners are left only with 
the beat once again.

LITERARY COLUMN

Literary Spring 
Break in Boston

H

ow was your Spring 
Break? Did you jet 
set off to some exotic 

locale? Is your mind still full of 
memories of sunshine, white sand 
beneath 
your toes 
and crystal 
blue waters?

Well, dear 

readers, the 
water I was 
surrounded 
by 
was 

mostly 
of 

the 
frozen 

variety 
as 

I decided to visit that illustrious 
spring break capital known as 
Boston. Yes, the Boston that is still 
recovering from the record-setting 
104 inches of snow it’s gotten this 
winter. It goes without saying that 
I sometimes make interesting life 
decisions.

But fear not, because though 

there were a few times I thought I 
might have been in the early stages 
of frostbite while waiting for the 
T, I still managed to have a highly 
enjoyable and informative trip 
thanks in large part to Boston’s 
expansive literary heritage.

In October of last year, Boston 

created 
the 
country’s 
first 

Literary Cultural District, which 
according to the Massachusetts 
Cultural Council is “a compact, 
walkable area of a community 
with a concentration of cultural 
facilities, activities, and assets,” in 
this case, pertaining to literature. 
In addition to notable places, the 
Literary Cultural District also 
promotes literary events like book 
festivals and poetry slams.

Literary districts are the latest 

development in a phenomenon 
known 
as 
literary 
tourism, 

when we bibliophiles visit places 
associated 
with 
our 
favorite 

writers or mentioned in fictional 
texts. It’s a rapidly growing 
industry in cities across the globe, 
from “Sherlock Holmes” tours in 
London to following the footsteps 
of “The Girl With the Dragon 
Tattoo” in Stockholm.

To be honest, there’s probably 

no better place in the U.S. to start 
a literary district than Boston. The 
entire city is pretty much your 
high school American Lit class 
come to life.

Of course, the first stop I made 

was to the recently installed 
Edgar Allan Poe statue. Poe and 
Boston have a somewhat fraught 
history, although that may be an 
understatement. Poe once said, 
“Bostonians have no soul.” While 
he was born in the city, Poe often 
criticized some of its most popular 
writers, especially those associated 
with 
the 
transcendentalist 

movement.

Though his birthplace has long 

since been demolished, there has 
been a recent effort by the city 
to reclaim the Poe legacy from 
Baltimore. As I have heard many 
Bostonians say of Baltimore, and 
I quote, “All he did was die there.” 
(In all fairness though, Richmond 
and New York could also stake 
claims to Poe.) In any case, the 
battle royale has resulted in one 
really cool statue, complete with 
raven and tell-tale heart.

(This particular statue may 

have also inspired a number of 
selfies in which Poe was captioned 
as “bae.” Interesting life decisions 
abound.)

The Literary Trail also includes 

the residences of a number of 
famous authors, including Louisa 
May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, 
Robert Frost, Henry James, Henry 
David Thoreau and John Updike. 
If none of those names interest 
you, why are you even reading this 
column?

There’s 
also 
an 
apartment 

building that poet Sylvia Plath 
may have lived in at one time, and 
if not, I apologize profusely to any 
tenants I may have creeped out 
while staring at it from across the 
street.

Then there’s the luxurious hotel 

Taj Boston, where Tennessee 
Williams revised his pièce de 
résistance, “A Streetcar Named 
Desire.” And the Tremont Temple, 
which hosted a variety of speakers 

including Charles Dickens for his 
first public reading of “A Christmas 
Carol.”

You can visit the Old South 

Meeting House, the church of 
Benjamin Franklin (who was 
baptized 
there) 
and 
Phillis 

Wheatley, the first published 
African American poet whose 
works garnered her great fame 
in England and helped gain her 
freedom.

And of course, don’t forget to 

visit the Old Corner Bookstore, 
internationally 
known 
in 

the 
nineteenth 
century 
for 

revolutionizing book publishing 
and releasing works by Harriet 
Beecher Stowe, Thoreau, Ralph 
Waldo 
Emerson 
and 
Henry 

Longfellow, just to name a few.

The Old Corner Bookstore, 

which happens to be built on 
land once belonging to Puritan 
troublemaker Anne Hutchinson, 
is a stop on the Freedom Trail, 
Literary 
Trail 
and 
Women’s 

Heritage Trail, so obviously, it now 
houses a Chipotle. I can personally 
testify to the unique feeling of 
being 
surrounded 
by 
period 

architecture and literary history 
while asking for more corn salsa.

You 
might 
be 
wondering, 

“Is this chick being paid by the 
Boston Department of Tourism?” 
The answer, sadly, is no. Though 
if packages of cream pies and 
clam chowder showed up on my 
doorstep after the publication of 
this column, well, let’s just say I 
wouldn’t ask too many questions.

As 
someone 
who 
avidly 

loves 
to 
read 
and 
travel, 

literary 
tourism 
just 
seems 

like a match made in heaven. 
If Boston’s Literary District 
proves successful, the idea will 
hopefully catch on in other cities 
with rich literary heritages like 
New York, New Orleans and 
Minneapolis/St. 
Paul. 
Heck, 

with a little research, maybe 
even here in Ann Arbor.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Daily Arts Writer

You may have read Yardain 

Amron’s piece in The Michigan 
Daily on Wednesday titled “Who’s 
Vic Mensa? You’ll know soon”. In 
it, Amron reviews a secret show of 
Mensa’s he caught in Chicago and 
also declares that Mensa’s work in 
recent months has finally brought 
the artist onto the hip-hop scene. 
Well, I have to respectfully dis-
agree.

A brief disclaimer: Vic Mensa 

went to Whitney M. Young Mag-
net High School in Chicago. So did 
I. Vic Mensa performed with his 
first band “Kids These Days” at 
various locations across Chicago. I 
was there — not at all of them, but 
a couple of them. I am incredibly 
jealous that I was not at that show 
with Amron, since I am undeni-
ably a fan.

Still, while Vic Mensa is not a 

new name for me, there’s plenty 
of evidence to indicate he was on 
the scene even before the “Kanye 
effect.”

Before focusing on his solo 

career Mensa was in the band 
Kids These Days, an eight member 
group with Mensa’s fellow Whit-
ney Young students and other high 
schoolers across the city. It was a 
rap-jazz-rock blend of sound that 
was exciting and inventive. Songs 
like “Darling”, “Bud Biliken” and 
“Don’t Harsh My Mellow” show 
the band’s impressive ability to 
combine the clever rapping of 
Mensa, the solid lead guitar and 
singing of Liam Cunningham and 
the hauntingly beautiful vocals of 
Macie Stewart. Also in the band 
was trumpet player Nico Segal, 
now Donnie Trumpet, who has 
since gone on to tour with Chance 
the Rapper’s band The Social 
Experiment and is taking the lead 
on their upcoming Surf album.

KTD formed in 2009 and 

quickly caught the local spotlight. 
However, it was their 2011 perfor-

mance at Chicago’s Lollapalooza 
music festival that earned them 
national acknowledgement. From 
there, the group landed a spot on 
“Conan” as a musical guest in 2012. 
All the while, Mensa’s name and 
face was slowly penetrating the 
music world.

Kids These Days split up in 

2013, after finding it difficult to 
financially support such a large 
group. From there, Mensa would 
go on to drop his first solo album, 
Innanet Tape, a superb debut 
featuring infectious beats like 
“Orange Soda” and “Hollywood 
LA”. While the album allowed 
Mensa to flex his muscles a bit 
more as a rapper — and earned 
him recognition as one of XXL 
magazine’s “Freshmen of the Year 
2014”— it was largely overshad-
owed by fellow FOY and “Save 
Money” companion Chance and 
his “Acid Rap” mixtape.

Things started to change with 

Mensa’s hit single, “Down On My 
Luck”. The song jumped to the top 
of the iTunes song charts, beat-
ing out Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy” 
and Drake’s “0 To 100/Catch 
Up.” The song was a driving-beat 
party tune, a diversion from the 

more prototypical rap Mensa had 
done previously, but was clearly a 
hit. And then, of course, his most 
widely known accomplishment to 
date: featuring on a Kanye West 
single “Wolves” and performing 
with him on national television.

It also can’t be forgotten that 

Mensa isn’t a stranger to Ann 
Arbor either, having performed at 
Hill Auditorium just last year.

So, even coming from a long-

time fan, it’s clear that Mensa 
had plenty of notoriety and at 
least some name recognition 
before this collaboration. Mensa 
was already on the stage before 
his performance with West, but 
“Wolves” pushed him directly 
into the spotlight.

As part of the wave of younger, 

inventive and fearless hip-hop 
artists, Mensa is indicative of an 
exciting couple of years to come for 
the genre. Mensa’s dabbling in an 
array of musical styles is evidence 
of his philosophy that music should 
be fun and this creative openness 
is something to be celebrated. In 
fact, it’s probably the reason West 
thought he’d be a good fit for what-
ever unknown sorcery he’s putting 
into his next album.

I walk down East Washington 

Street toward a brick building 
with blocks of bright colors 
painted around its doorway. I 
ring the bell and quickly come 
face to face with a woman 
wearing an easy smile. I reach 
out my hand to greet her, but 
I’m instead embraced by an 
enthusiastic German Shepherd 
(whose name I later learn is 
Miss Lilian Moosecow, or just 
“Moose”). No formalities here, 
it seems.

The woman is Mary Thiefels, 

founder of Tree Town Murals, 
“a mural art company in public 
art, 
corporate 
murals 
and 

private spaces,” she explained. 
She’s worn many other hats, 

though: 
student 
at 
both 

Pioneer and Community High 
School, waitress at Jerusalem 
Garden, bartender at Café Zola 
and, 
currently, 
Visual 
Arts 

Coordinator at local nonprofit 
the Neutral Zone, whose offices 
I happen to be comfortably 
seated in. When she speaks, it’s 
with an obvious affection for 
her art – specifically, murals – 
and an intimate knowledge of 
her hometown – Ann Arbor.

“For years, when I was in 

high school, there was just a 
bunch of miscellaneous tag art. 
There was even profanities,” 
she explained. “But otherwise, 
there 
was 
nothing 
really 

inspiring happening.”

But, 
of 
course, 
Thiefels 

changed 
all 
that. 
After 

graduating high school, she 

began taking advanced studio 
art 
classes, 
studying 
color 

theory and life drawing with 
renowned community artists 
such as Fred Horowitz and 
John Lockard. At the age of 
19, she created her first mural 
on Felch Street within a local 
railroad underpass, a “bridge 
between neighborhood and city 
center,” she said. 19 was also 
the age Thiefels and her friends 
were arrested for malicious 
destruction of property.

“We all tried to run, and then 

we’re like, ‘Wait this is stupid. 
We’re really not doing anything 
wrong.’ Like, we really felt 
like what we were doing was 
morally correct,” Thiefels said.

And apparently, so did the 

city – the charges were dropped 
after 
overwhelming 
support

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Ah, 1950s suburbia. Green 

grass, pink flamingos, perfect 
pastel houses with perfect 
pastel 
hus-

bands 
and 

really 
cool 

shrubbery. 
Those 
were 

the days — a 
simpler time 
of 
domes-

tic bliss and 
brushed-
under-the-
spotless-
kitchen-table 
misogyny.

Add a little bit of leather 

and some surprisingly femi-
nist undertones to the tra-
ditional ’50s aesthetic and, 
hey, you’ve got yourself a hot 
new music video from Megan 
Trainor, queen of bass.

Bubblegum 
doo-wop 

accompanies an explosion of 
colors when you hit play on 
“Dear Future Husband” — 
it’s exciting, visually enticing 
and just really freaking cute. 
Trainor “tests out” a variety 
of studly fellas throughout the 
three and a half minutes. “Hey 

future husband,” she inquires 
in her day dress, can you cook 
a meal that covers more than 
an inch of the plate? The first 
suitor fails miserably, bring-
ing her a bleak, lone scallop 
and one green bean. That 
doesn’t contribute to the well-
being of bass. Out with him.

She won’t settle, and in 

that light, the video’s kitschy, 
retro persona becomes sugar-
coated satire. Gender roles 
are challenged — ideas of ’50s 
“womanhood,” 
lusciously 

lampooned. Outfit changes 

(Trainor and her cat-eyed 
eyeliner look better than ever) 
and blue skies continue as 
she sings, “You got that 9 to 
5, but, baby, so do I, so don’t 
be thinking I’ll be home and 
baking apple pies.” Cue: an 
apple pie engulfed in Hades’s 
flames.

Got that, future husband? 

Respect and equality is all it 
takes. Oh, and a box of pizza 
— the gent carrying a greasy 
Italian pie wins out in the end. 
It’s not delivery; it’s feminism.

TRAILER REVIEW

The 
latest 
trailer 
for 

“Insurgent,” the upcoming 
sequel to last year’s “Diver-
gent,” doesn’t 
show much to 
get the view-
er excited for 
the 
movie. 

Practically 
every 
line 

of 
dialogue 

uttered sounds like some-
thing you’ve heard a million 
times already, including lines 
as unmemorable as “We have 
to stop her … together,” “This 
is the only chance to rescue 
what little civilization we 
have left” and “Dark times 
call for extreme measures.” 
Even the title of the trailer 
is generic: “Stand Together.” 
Themes of teamwork or sacri-
fice could theoretically make 
the movie more than another 
by-the-numbers 
dystopian 

trope-fest, but nothing in 
the trailer suggests anything 
thoughtful or new.

The trailer does promise 

action for the movie, though 
even that is uninventive and 
tedious. In a convenient mon-

tage that doesn’t pause long 
enough for you to realize how 
uninteresting each individual 
shot is, Tris (Shailene Wood-
ley, “The Fault in Our Stars”) 
leaps through a glass wall, a 
CGI building explodes, Four’s 
(Theo James, “Bedlam”) face 
disintegrates into little sil-
ver bubbles, a blue laser beam 
ripples down a street and Tris 
jumps off a building, soaring 
through the air to catch the 
end of a cable. None of this 
looks real, and in many of 
them, it’s clear that even in the 

context of the movie, they’re 
supposed to be simulations. An 
action movie built on attrac-
tive action simulations could 
be fun and cool-looking — after 
all, any action movie is techni-
cally unreal — but there’s no 
exciting choreography, little 
genuine emotion and worst of 
all, no apparent stakes. Unless 
you count Ansel Elgort saying, 
“You are living proof that the 
Divergent problem has grown 
beyond all control” as a signi-
fier of legitimate conflict.

from the community and even 
the Ann Arbor Railroad, who 
later asked her to continue 
creating 
murals 
for 
their 

underpasses. She was given 
commissions by the Ann Arbor 
City Council and approached 
by private businesses including 
the Arena Sports Bar and 
Grill, which still bears an 
early 
Thiefels 
mural. 
“It’s 

not on my website; it’s sort of 
embarrassing,” she said. But it 
was that positive community 
response that inspired her to 
take the next step.

“I was like, ‘I’m doing this. 

This is way too much fun.’ I’m 
painting. I’m designing. I’m 
outside. People love it. Like, 
what is not cool about this?” 
she added. “So that’s when I 
decided, Tree Town Murals, 
that’s my company.”

After its birth in 2007, Tree 

Towns quickly began to reach 
other areas of Michigan such 
as Hillsdale, Whitmore Lake 
and Chelsea. Thiefels designed 
murals centering around city 
pride and town history, honing 
her artistic skill and learning 
how to better run her business 
through 
collaboration 
with 

historians 
and 
community 

members on the projects.

“Any artist will get really 

good at taking the ideas and 
concepts from the people they’re 
working with and collaborating 
with but then also putting their 
own unique twist on it,” Thiefels 
said about her experience. “You 
can kind of read a community, 
whether 
they’re 
ready 
for 

something really contemporary 
or if they really need something 
that’s still a little dated and more 
about the history.”

And, at its core, that’s what 

Tree Town Murals is all about: 
community involvement.

Whether it’s an open dialogue 

about the piece or hands-on 
involvement, Thiefels makes sure 

everyone can contribute. To do 
so, she, along with her business 
partner and artistic collaborator, 
Daniel 
Matanic, 
created 
a 

concept 
called 
“paint-by-

number.” With a paint brush in 
hand and some instruction from 
Tree Town volunteers, members 
of the community with no artistic 
experience have the opportunity 
to be a part of something larger 
than 
themselves, 
to 
create 

something for their city by filling 
in designated parts of the mural.

“The community paint days 

or participatory aspects have 
resonance tenfold,” Thiefels said. 
“Even spending ten minutes on 
the wall, like filling in a little 
area, that person takes pride 
in the whole painting ... even if 
they can’t see their brushstroke 
perfectly,” she said.

Of the participants involved, 

many are adolescents, an age 
group Thiefels has a lot of 
experience with. In the past, she’s 
taught summer programs at the 
Ann Arbor Art Center and adopted 
teenage 
apprentices 
to 
assist 

with her projects, many of whom 
she now calls good friends with 
amazing art careers.

In 2013, she began working at 

the Neutral Zone, where student 
artwork decorates the classroom 
we’re seated in. Moose lays quietly 
in his dog bed, a Verner Panton 
heart-cone chair sits near us. “We 
found it on the street, but we don’t 
know if it’s an exact original,” she 
said. The place oozes with warmth 

and welcoming, as it should. The 
nonprofit prides itself on being 
a youth-driven space, one that 
fosters creativity and growth 
and offers a unique partnership 
between adults and those youths. 
In fact, 50 percent of the Neutral 
Zone’s Board of Directors are 
youths.

“We 
run 
visual 
arts 

programming, 
music 

programming, 
literary 
arts 

programming. We have leadership 
and education, which are more 
of our youth empowerment and 
activism groups. They’re kind of 
after school activities,” Thiefels 
said. “A lot of our teens that have 
gone through two to four years 
of Neutral Zone activities are 
now equipped with these ‘21st 
century skills’ of collaborating 
and knowing how to represent 
themselves and their ideas.”

A cohesiveness between the two 

organizations naturally appeared 
soon after Thiefels took the job. 
From then on, she successfully 
integrated Tree Towns’s public 
mural aspect into the Neutral 
Zone’s youth-oriented programs, 
giving adolescents the opportunity 
to use mural art as an expressive 
outlet — something Thiefels views 
as essential to daily life.

“(Public pieces) inspire people 

to look at the world differently and 
think about themselves differently. 
To promote and sponsor the 
arts is a viable way for healing 
our city centers, our economies, 
and ourselves,” Thiefels said. “I 
want to be a part of that trend, 
where public murals are a form 
of activism or a form of changing 
minds, a form of changing lives.”

One day, Thiefels hopes to 

impact cities beyond Michigan, 
to 
illustrate 
the 
voices 
and 

imaginations 
of 
communities 

outside the United States, to 
add color to the lives of unique 
individuals all over the world.

“This,” she said, “is just the 

beginning.”
