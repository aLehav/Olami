State Senate
passes bill
on GSRA
unioniZation

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
U.S. Rep John Dingell (D-Mich.) speaks at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy about the current state of Congress yesterday.

Legislation now
moves to state
House for vote
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH and
HALEY GLATTORN
Daily NewsEditors
Ongoing efforts by the Gradu-
ate Employees' Organization to
obtain unionization rights for
graduate student research assis-
tants have faced a setback, fol-
lowing passage of a bill in the
state Senate yesterday that clas-
sified GSRAs as students, not
public employees with right to
organize.
Introduced by state Senate
Majority Leader Randy Rich-
ardville (R-Monroe), the leg-
islation will restrict graduate
students from achieving status
as public employees, thereby
preventing them from claiming
collective bargaining rights and
obtaining representation from
a union. Yesterday's vote comes
just one day after it had passed
through the Senate Government

Operations Committee, and the
bill will now move on to the
state House of Representatives.
The vote also comes on the
heels of an emergency meet-
ing by the University's Board
of Regents to pass a resolution
in opposition to the bill. The
regents voted 6-2, along party
lines,, to approve the resolu-
tion and instructed Cynthia
Wilbanks, the University's
vice president of governmental
affairs, to garner support among
state legislators to vote against
the bill.
Bob McCann, communica-
tions director for Senate Minor-
ity Leader Gretchen Whitmer
(D-East Lansing), said Senate
Republicans approved the billso
quickly - it was introduced last
week - to avoid interference
from negative public feedback.
"They were hoping to get it
through before the community
had a chance to weigh in on it,"
McCann said. "We like to think
that as part of our democratic
process, people have an appro-
priate amount of time to think

U.S. Rep. discusses
shortfalls of
legislative branch
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Stashed away in the office
of U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) is a letter written by a
colonial-era British parliamen-
tarian. The letter, which he
said he reads from time to time,

states in part: "I owe the people,
I serve the duty of the British
truth, the greatest decency, the
greatest humility and the great-
est ethics."
At a discussion held at the
Gerald R. Ford School of Public
Policy yesterday, Dingell told
the crowd of about 100 stu-
dents that the letter serves as
more than a symbol of his civic
responsibility to the public - it
reminds him of what he believes
has gone wrong with Congress
in the last decade. Dingell criti-

cized the representative body
for its persistent partisanship,
unfulfilling promises to the
public and its abdication of pub-
lic duty.
Dingell, who is the longest-
serving member in the history
of the House of Representatives,
said he was "distressed" at
the current state of politics
in Congress. At the event, he
repeatedly attacked the lack of,
bipartisanship between Demo-
crats and Republicans and
blamed it for many of the issues

in Congress today.
"I remember in Congress
when members had huge differ-
ences but great friendships that
went across the aisle," he said.
"That still exists among some of
the older members, and it's pos-
sible it could be done. But the
taxpayers, the voters, the media
have got to tell Congress, 'You
work for us. We expect that you
will not have the kind of hostile,
destructive behavior that we're
seeing."'

Engineering Dean David Munson

What were your dreams as akid?
I grew up in the 1950s and '60s and
it was the era of the big space race with
the Soviet Union. Iwas reallyinterested
in space, but was also really interested
in communication systems. My dream
was to be working for either NASA or
a research lab, or anything that would
involve math or science.
What brought you to the Univer-
sity?
I had been a regular professor for
many years at the University of Illi-
nois and at some point I decided to try
administration. So, I came to Michigan
in 2003 as the chair of electrical engi-
neering and computer science. It was
really the opportunity for that kind of
job and the overall high quality of the
University that brought me here.

DINGELL
From Page 1A
Dingell said the kind of bipar-
tisanship he remembers from his
earlier "puppy" years in congress
is still possible, noting the efforts
he's made with current members
of Congress. However, he blamed
the current situation, in part, on
the inability of many representa-
tives to make their duty to the
public a priority.
"We have to sit down and say
look (what my Dad told me): Son,
the best politics is the best public
service," he said. "If you do what
is best for the country, the people
are going to put you back into
power. If you don't, they won't."
Dingell recalled when he
warned his father, who preced-
ed him in serving in Congress,
about candidates who were pre-
paring to run against him during
re-election periods.
"Dad would say to me, 'Son,
don't worry. I take care of my
people,"' Dingell said. "That's a
great rule to follow, but I don't
think a lot of my colleagues
have."
When discussing legislative
issues, Dingell said he favors
some form of union between gay
and lesbian couples, though he
did not comment specifically on
marriage equality.
Dingell also decried the influ-
ence of money on politics, label-

ing the Citizens United Supreme
Court decision likening corpo-
rations to people as "absolutely
outrageous." He said he spent
$19,000 on his first campaign,
much less than the hundreds of
millions of dollars politicians
spend on campaigns now.
Dingell still defended mem-
bers of Congress against frequent
accusations that they mislead
the public. He said it is easy for
members of the public to confuse
their changing ideals with learn-
ing on the job, and using ques-
tionable sources of information
as distortion.
"Most (members), honestly,
are trying to tell you the truth,"
he said. "Some of them will view
the truth as something they
heard on some broadcast or read
in some kind of a newspaper or
heard in church, and every once
in a while, those folks are right
and every once in a while, they're
wrong."
Dingell added that lobbyists
and special interests are wrongly
criticized for harming the politi-
cal process. While he admitted
that many lobbyists go too far in
pursuing members of Congress,
he said precluding them from
voicing their opinion would be a
violation of democracy.
"The fait of the matter is
that everybody is entitled to be
heard," he said. "Everybody,
including lobbyists, has a right
to be heard and their concerns be

evaluated properly in the process
of writing legislation."
In an interview after the event,
Public Policy Dean Susan Collins
said she appreciated that Ding-
ell answered so many questions
and contributed to a transparent
atmosphere.
"Not everyone has to agree
with his standpoints, but I think
he does an excellent job explain-
ing why he holds certain posi-
tions," Collins said.
Collins pointed to Dingell's
assertion of seeking accurate
facts on a particular issue as an
important lesson she hoped that
students learned from the event.
Many students echoed Collins,
and said they enjoyed the oppor-
tunity to hear from Dingell even
if they did not share his opinions.
Rackham student Ariel Pearl-
Jacobvitz said she welcomed the
chance to hear about Congress's
problems from an insider.
"My biggest problem with
politics is politics for the sake
of politics - egos in the way of
actually getting things done and
politicians seeing themselves as
lords over men," Pearl-Jacobvitz
said. "There's just an issue when
it becomes this horse and pony
show."
Rackham student Andrew
Bracken said Dingell offers inter-
esting insight into the legislative
process.
"He's kind of an institution in
himself," he said.

about the issue."
McCann said the bill was an
attempt to restrict graduate stu-
dents' rights, calling its implica-
tions "disappointing."
Rackham student Stephen
Raiman, founder of Students
Against GSRA Unionization,
said the legislation's passage in
the House is a positive develop-
ment and will benefit GSRAs
if the bill makes it through the
House.
"GSRA unionization is very
harmful to the University and
(it's) a bad deal for GSRAs,"
Raiman said. "This legislation
protects us from the threat of
forced unionization and will
prevent (GEO) from changing
the law from the way it (has)
been for 30 years."
Raiman said SAGU members
will continue to work with leg-
islators to ensure its passage in
the House.
He added that the bill is not
impeding GEOs ongoing efforts
within the Michigan Employ-
ment Relations Commission to
try to reverse a 1981 ruling that
prevents GSRAs from claiming

status as public employees.
At the beginning of the
month, GEO presented evidence
and called witnesses before an
administrative law judge argu-
ing in support of GSRA union-
ization. Both the University
and GEO had the opportunity
to make arguments and cross-
examine witnesses.
"MERC is simply interpreting
the statute, and it was decided
in 1981 that the law considered
GSRAs to not be employees,"
Raiman said. "MERC is trying
to change that, but really all
MERC does is administer the
laws that are on the books."
Rackham student Liz
Rodrigues, communications
chair for GEO, disagreed with
Raiman's stance and said she
believes that the bill is an attack
on GSRAs' rights and MERC's
involvement in the dispute.
"I do think it's an attempt
to interfere with the ongoing
MERC process," Rodrigues said.
"In terms of its impact, I don't
know now ... but we are confi-
dent that GSRAs are employees
and we trust in the MERC pro-
cess."
She added that the passage of
the legislation is not surprising
because the issue has continued

to divide politicians along party
lines, noting that the Senate has
a large Republican majority.
Though members of SAGU
are hopeful that the bill will
pass through the House, which
is forbidden from voting on the
bill until at least five days after
its passage in the Senate, they
are continuing their efforts to
be heard by MERC.
Julia Stern, the administra-
tive law judge assigned to the
case, determined that SAGU and
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette, who are opposed to
unionization, would be allowed
to call witnesses and submit
evidence outside of the official
hearing.
This week, Stern has heard
testimony from those opposed
to unionization, and today she
is expected to hear testimo-
ny from Stephen Forrest, the
University's vice president of
research.
Stern will consider the evi-
dence presented to her and sub-
mit a recommendation to MERC
next month. MERC ultimately
has the power to determine
whether or not GSRAs should
be classified as public employ-
ees and have the right to vote to
unionize.

Federal District
Court rules DOMA
unconstitutional
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
federal judge in San Francisco
ruled yesterday that the U.S.
government cannot deny health
benefits to the wife of a lesbian
court employee by relying on the
1996 law that bars government
recognition of same-sex unions.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey
White said that because the
Defense of Marriage Act uncon-
stitutionally discriminates
against same-sex married cou-
ples, the government's refusal
to furnish health insurance to
Karen Golinski's wife is unjusti-
fied.
"The Court finds that DOMA,
as applied to Ms. Golinski, vio-
latesherrighttoequalprotection
of the law... by, without substan-
tial justification or rational basis,
refusing to recognize her lawful
marriage to prevent provision
of health insurance coverage to
her spouse," White wrote in a
43-page decision that marks the
third time in less than two years
a federal court has declared the
act unconstitutional.
Golinski, a staff lawyer for
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of

Appeals, has been trying to
secure spousal benefits for her
wife, Amy Cunninghis, since
shortly after the couple got
married during the brief win-
dow in 2008 when same-sex
marriages were legal in Cali-
fornia. Her boss, Chief Judge
Alex Kozinski, approved her
request, but the Office of Per-
sonnel Management ordered
Golinski's insurer not to pro-

Crash sparks
criticism of
country's rail safety
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) - A train packed with
morning commuters slammed
into a downtown station yes-
terday, killing 49 people and
injuring hundreds as passenger
cars crumpled and windows
exploded around them. It was
Argentina's worst train acci-
dent in decades.
The cause wasn't immedi-
ately determined, but many
pointed to a deteriorating
rail system. Some passengers
reported signs the conductor
was struggling with the brakes
before the crash, saying he kept
overshooting platforms and
missed one entirely.
The dead included 48 adults
and one child - most of whom
had crowded into the first
two cars to get ahead of the
rush-hour crowds on arrival.
Some 600 people were injured,
including 461 who were hospi-
talized, Transportation Secre-
tary J.P. Schiavi said.
Hours after the crash, pas-
sengers' relatives gathered at
the morgue anxious for word of
their loved ones.
Ezekiel Mercado said he and
his mother-in-law had been
frantically searching for his
wife, Sabrina Espindola, 29,
who didn't show up for work
yesterday. They checked nine
hospitals before heading to the
morgue, he said.
"I went everywhere. She is
always with her Blackberry. We
are always in contact," he said.
"This morgue is the last place

I thought of, but, well, she's
missing. I call her cell phone,
and it rings, rings, but she isn't
responding."
Speaking at a news confer-
ence, Schiavi defended the rail
system's maintenance record.
"It was an accident like those
in many other countries," he
said, pointing to a newspaper
clipping about a fatal crash in
Los Angeles. "In recent years,
we've made huge investments"
in the system.
As Schiavi spoke, riot police
faced off against angry pas-
sengers in the closed Once sta-
tion, where emergency workers
spent hours extracting doz-
ens of people trapped inside
the train's first car. Rescuers
had to slice open the roof and
set up a pulley system to ease
them out one by one. Dozens
of the injured were lined up on
stretchers on the station plat-
form.
The 28-year-old conductor,
who survived the crash, was
apparently well-rested, Schiavi
said, having just begun his work-
day.
"Tiredness, his (young) age,
the problems that a conductor
might face" are among the fac-
tors being investigated, he said.
"This young person had just
begun his shift moments before
the accident."
The motorman was hospi-
talized in intensive care and
hasn't given a statement, Schi-
avi added.
Passengers said the conduc-
tor seemed to struggle with the
brakes, missing his stopping
marks at station after station,
though a labor union official said
the train appeared to be in good
working order.

"This machine left the shop
yesterday and the brakes worked
well. From what we know, it
braked without problems at
previous stations. At this point
I don't want to speculate about
the causes," union chief Ruben
Sobrero told Radio La Red.
Schiavi said the train was
recorded slowing from about
30 miles per hour (50 kph) to 12
miles per hour about 40 yards
(meters) before the impact. "We
don't know what happened in
those final 40 meters," he said.
The train slammed into a
shock-absorbing barrier at 8:33
a.m., smashing the front of the
engine and crunching the much
lighter cars behind it. The sec-
ond car penetrated nearly 20
feet (six meters) into the next,
Schiavi said.
Most damaged was the first
car, where passengers shared
space with bicycles. Survivors
said many people were injured
in a jumble of metal and glass.
Security camera images showed
windows exploding as the cars
crumpled into each other like
an accordion, with a man on the
adjacent platform scrambling
across the tracks to escape the
wreck.
The rush-hour train carried
more than 1,200 people, many
standing so tightly between the
seats that they had nothing to
hold onto. The hard stop sent
them flying inside the.cars.
Many suffered bruises or
lesser injuries, waiting for atten-
tion on the station's platforms as
helicopters and dozens of ambu-
lances carried others to nearby
hospitals. The dead were car-
ried out the back of the station,
beyond the view of television
cameras.

Hamas agrees to
unify with Fatah

Rivalry between
Palestinian parites
to come to an end
CAIRO (AP) - The leadership
of the Islamic militant Hamas
yesterday settled internal dis-
agreements and approved a
unity deal with its political rival,
Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas, a senior official said.
Hamas' political bureau, the
group's top decision-making
body, met in Cairo and signed off
on the deal after more than 12
hours of talks over two days, said
Izzat al-Rishq, an aide to Hamas
chief Khaled Mashaal.
Since 2007, the rivals have run
separate governments - Abbas
in the West Bank and Hamas in
Gaza. An agreement signed in
Doha, Qatar, between Mashaal
and Abbas on Feb. 6 envisions
Abbas heading an interim unity
government ahead of general
elections in the Palestinian ter-
ritories.
Hamas leaders in Gaza, who
have most to lose from the unity

deal, had objected to relinquish-
ing power to Abbas. The orga-
nization has employed tens of
thousands in official posts inside
the territory who now face inte-
gration into larger Palestinian
bodies that might be headed by
Abbas loyalists.
While the deal might still
face opposition from the Hamas
rank-and-file, Rishq suggested
that the movement's leaders are
now on board.
"The meeting decided to fully
implement the reconciliation
agreement and the Doha decla-
ration," al-Rishq said. "It puts
an end to the debate and discus-
sions over Hamas' position con-
cerning the Dohaagreement and
puts an end to what seemed to be
disagreement within Hamas."
Abbas and Mashaal met later
Wednesday in Cairo to discuss
the next steps in the deal, includ-
ing the formation of an interim
government that is to be made
up of politically independent
technocrats. Such a composition
is meant to lower the profile of
Hamas, shunned by the West as
a terror organization.

U.S., North Korean envoys
to open negotiations today

Restarted talks will
be the first time the
parties have met
since last year
BEIJING (AP) - U.S. and
North Korea envoys reopen
nuclear talks today, seeking
ways for Pyongyang to dis-
mantle its nuclear programs in
return for much-needed aid.
The countries were on the
verge of a deal to have Washing-
ton provide food if Pyongyang
suspends its uranium enrich-
ment program when the agree-
ment was upended by the death
of the country's longtime leader
Kim Jong I1 on Dec. 17.
"Today is, as we say, 'Game
day.' We will have an opportu-
nity to meet with First Vice For-
eign Minister Kim and his team,"
U.S. envoy Glyn Davies said
before the start of morning talks
with Kim Kye Gwan at the North
Korean Embassy in Beijing.
The two will hold a second
session this afternoon at the
U.S. Embassy.
Davies said it was a good sign
that North Korea had agreed
to re-enter talks so soon after
the death of Kim Jong I as the

country transfers power to his
young son, Kim Jong Un, and a
coterie of advisers.
He said a key point was to see
if North Korea was willing to
fulfill obligations made in ajoint
statement in September 2005,
whichcommittedNorthKoreato
abandoning its nuclear program
in exchange for aid and pledges
that Washington wouldn't seek
the regime's ouster.
State Department spokesman
Mark Toner said in Washington
that the United States was "cau-
tiously optimistic" about the
talks.
The talks in Beijing, the third
round since July, ostensibly are
aimed at restarting wider six-
nation disarmament negotiations
that also involve China, Japan,
Russia and South Korea. Pyong-
yang walked away from those
talks in 2009 and later exploded
its second nuclear device.
The six-nation talks, once
restarted, would be aimed at dis-
mantling North Korea's remain-
ingnuclearprogrpmsinexchange
forwhatwould fikelyinvolveeven
greater donations of aid.
Toner said food assistance
would be discussed in the talks,
but that the United States has
some concerns it wants North
Korea to address. He did not say

what those concerns were, but
analysts have said North Korea
must agree to have U.N. watch-
dogs monitor any freeze of its
uranium enrichment. Other-
wise it could backtrack - as it
has done with previous agree-
ments.
Worries about North Korea's
nuclear capability took on
renewed urgency in Novem-
ber 2010 when the country
disclosed a uranium enrich-
ment facility that could give it
a second route to manufacture
nuclear weapons, in addition
to its existing plutonium-based
program.wise it could back-
track - as it has done with pre-
vious agreements.
As the envoys began their
talks, North Korea's state
media criticized next month's
Nuclear Security Summit in
Seoul, which is expected to
draw dozens of world leaders,
including President Barack
Obama, to discuss nuclear ter-
rorism and safety.
"It is illogical to discuss
the 'nuclear security' issue in
South Korea, the U.S. nuclear
advance base and a hotbed
of nuclear war," the North's
official Korean Central News
Agency said in a commentary
today.

Eliminate exclusions
U' childcaresubsidy should be available for all
2001 University study estimated that approximately 20
percent of graduate students and 2 percent of undergradu-
ate students are parents. Since 1994, the University has had
a childcare subsidy program in place to reduce the cost of licensed
childcare for graduate and undergraduate students with children.
Though the University has raised the dollar amount of the subsidy
through several negotiations with GEG in the last decade, parents
still want the program to be expanded. Some limitations - that a
student's spouse must be employed outside the home for 20 hours
per week - unfairly exclude some international couples as well as
students with spouses that are currently unemployed. On Tuesday,
the Central Student Government passed a resolution aimed at wid-
ening the scope of the program to provide more student-parents with
access to subsidies. The University should consider CSG's resolution
and widen eligibility considerations.

Santorum's religious campaign

i
I

As the Michigan Republican
primary fast approaches,
national and local news-
papers -
including The
Michigan Daily
- have honed in
on the two can-
didates who have
emerged as the
frontrunners:
Mitt Romney and SARAH
Rick Santorum. ROHAN
Most recent
polls showRom-
ney and Santorum in a statistical
tie in the race for the Michigan pri-
mary. Romney, Detroit-born and
son of a former Michigan governor,
beat John McCain in the Michigan
primary four years ago. However,
four years and one very different
auto industry later, the sentiment of
many Michigan voters toward Rom-
ney has changed.
Speculative poll results for the
Michigan primary, combined with a
recent three-state sweep, merit Rick
Santorum a closer look. But the more
I see, the less I like -not because he
goes against my personal political
views (though that may have some-
thing to do with it), but because the
religious views he has expressed
throughout this campaign are ones
which no serious candidate for the
presidency should ever get away
with saying.
As a deeply religious candidate,
it's not surprising that religion plays
a prominent role in Santorum's cam-
paign, especially as he tries to secure
the evangelical and right-wing
vote. However, when discussing his
Christian faith, Santorum has made
claims that are utterly false.
In a 2011 campaign rally in South
Carolina, Santorum claimed, "The

idea that the Crusades and the fight
of Christendom against Islam is
somehow an aggression on our part
is absolutely anti-historical. And
that is what the perception is by the
American Left who hates Christen-
dom." According to the "Encyclope-
dia Britannica," the Crusades were
a series of "military expeditions"
whose "objectives were to check the
spread of Islam" - the Crusades as a
"fight of christendom against Islam"
is a historical truth, not a leftist lie.
Ifsa student at the University made
a claim identical to Santorum's in
an academic paper, he or she would
undoubtedly face consequences.
Such a reality implies that, as stu-
dents, we are held to a higher stan-
dardthanacandidate forpresidency.
Propelling Santorum's religious
campaign are claims that Obama's
administration has been an "assault
on all religion in America." In a
speech at Hope College in Holland,
Mich, this Monday, Santorum said,
"What the president is now seeming
to mold, in the image of other elitists
who think that they know best, is to
limit the role of faith in the public
square and your role to live that faith
out in your public and private lives."
This claim comes after a comment
Santorum made Saturday, calling
Obama's beliefs, "some phony ideal,
some phony theology. Oh, not a the-
ology based on the Bible, a different
theology, but no less a theology." If
anyone is making an assault on reli-
gion here, I would say it's Santorum.
Santorum asserts that his state-
ment was not really about Obama's
religion but rather "about his world
view, and the way he approaches
problems in this country. I think
they're different than how most
people do in America." Equating a
difference in approach to "the prob-

lems in this country" with a "phony
theology" is extreme. Furthermore,
as a citizen of a country whose gov-
ernment was established on the
premise of separation of church and
state, I take major issue with Santo-
rum criticizing Obama for making
decisions that aren't "based on the
Bible." When one religious ethos
begins to dictate America's actions,
the country ceases to be a democ-
racy. It's a theocracy.
America is a
democracy, not a
theocracy.
In a recent blog post on The New
York Times' website, Santorum's
campaign has been called one of
"religious supremacy." In light of his
recent statements on religion, that
sounds about right.
It isn't the first time in this cam-
paign that a candidate has made
offensive remarks (see: Rick Perry).
However, these statements speak
not only to Santorum's close-mind-
edness as a candidate, but show his
campaign to be one disproportion-
ately concerned with religion in this
country. As I said before, America is a
democracy, not a theocracy. If Santo-
rum's campaign gave half the atten-
tion to America's more imminent
problems - like healthcare and eco-
nomic reform - as it did to the faith
of its citizens, perhaps he could gain
a following composed of more than
just right-wing Christians.

Though the program's set of eligibility
restrictions are reasonable, the work-study
provision hurts some candidates who truly
deserve a subsidy. In order to receive aid
from the office of Financial Aid, the student
must be a single parent. If married, the stu-
dent's spouse or partner must be in school
or employed outside the home for at least 20
hours a week. Obviously, any expectation
of the OFA that those who are unemployed
ought to take their child along on the job
search is impractical. The spouses of many
international students have student visas, or F
visas, which do not allow them to work out-
side of the University. The program eligibility
requirements also discriminate against those
students with spouses that work from home.
Increasing funding for any University
program is difficult. However, the Gradu-
ate Employees' Organization and CSG have
pledged significant monetary contributions
should the University choose to implement

Tuesday's resolution. GEO has already pledged
part of its salary increase to the childcare sub-
sidy funds. CSG has made a similar commit-
ment, offering $35,000 to the program. The
initiative may be able to make use of a sum
set aside for use at GEO's recommendations
for reform within the program - a memoran-
dum between the union and the University last
March established $75,000 for any future child
care subsidy program reforms.
The OFA needs to make international stu-
dents as well as those students whose spouses
maybe looking for work or telecommuting from
home eligible for the program. Though these
individuals do not comprise a significant por-
tion of student-parents, a number of deserving
candidates are still shut out from this benefi-
cial program. Regardless of size, any exclusion
is reason enough for reform. The University
needs to listen to CSG's proposal, work with
the demands of the GEO and take steps to close
any loopholes in eligibility requirements.

Just (and) good busns

Don't be alarmed when you start receiving
coupons in the mail for products you're not
even aware you need yet. Recent consumer
research led by huge retail stores such as Tar-
get shows that companies are now able to ana-
lyze the routines and habits of their shoppers
to fully exploit their needs and wants. This
means companies can paste together your
demographic information, purchasing history
and frequently-visited websites to predict what
type of individual you are and what products
you may be interested in buying in the future.
Whether you are an obsessive beachgoer pur-
chasing new bikinis in April or a soon-to-be
mom, Target is able to analyze your regular
shopping routine to create customized, indi-
vidual ad booklets that will be personally
mailed to your address. Not only is this new
method of customer service alarmingly accu-
rate, but it's also an invasion of privacy and a
breach of personal liberty.
According to a Feb. 19 New York Times arti-
cle, Andrew Pole, who has a master's degree in
statistics and economics, was hired by Target
in 2002 to "analyze all 'cue-routine-reward'
loops among shoppers and figure out how to
exploit them." In other words, Pole was hired
to observe consumers as much as possible so
that Target customers would be able to receive
personalized coupon booklets in the mail per-
taining to their past purchasing history and
shopping routines. As helpful as this may ini-
tially sound, it's taking customer service to
a whole new level and opening doors which
many consumers believe lead down a danger-
ous path. Pole is able to strategically pick out
the pool goers and beach bums from the giant
Target database so that they receive coupons
for dieting books in the winter and sunscreen
in the summer. But his insight into consumers'
habits is much more powerful and personal
than that alone.
Since hiring Pole in 2002, Target's total rev-
enue has increased by more than $23 billion as
of 2010, thanks to his strategic habit analysis.
But the majority of this increase in profits is
due to Pole's pregnancy-prediction program,
which is a score customers receive based on
their purchasing history of 25 separate prod-
ucts, ranging from cotton balls to unscented
body lotion. No longer is Target simply ste-
reotyping mothers based on whether they
purchase diapers or pacifiers; they are now dig-
ging deeper into their personal lives than ever

before. Surprisingly, the prediction score turns
out to be extremely accurate.
A year after Pole's model was created, an
angry father stormed into a Minneapolis Tar-
get raging about why his daughter, who was
still in high school, received Target coupons
for maternity clothes and baby products in
the mail. The furious dad complained to the
manager and asked why Target was send-
ing an encouraging message to teenage girls
to become pregnant and have a baby at such
a young age. It turned out that after speak-
ing with his daughter later on, she was indeed
pregnant. By analyzing her shopping habits
and routine, Target was able to identify a young
expecting mother before her own father was
even aware of the situation. This new means
of customer service is invasive and much too
personal. Predicting a teenage boy's love of
video games is one thing, but analyzing a shop-
per's routine to decide if he or she is pregnant,
a recent divorcee or a new college graduate is a
completely different matter.
This intrusive method of increasing sales
is only the beginning of a long road that lies
ahead. "Just wait.We'llbe sendingyoucoupons
for things you want before you even know you
want them," Pole told The New York Times. In
reality, do customers actually feel completely
comfortable with huge corporations knowing
their personal business and digging up their
past history? My gut feeling suggests no. Even
after applying the pregnancy-prediction model
to just a small fraction of the Target database,
customers who received coupon booklets with
only baby products and maternity clothing felt
as though they'd been spied on, and they had
adverse reactions to the advertisements.
Last time I checked, Target wasn't code-
name for Big Brother, so why does the cor-
poration obsessively analyze and push into
customers' personal lives? No one wants to
feel like they're being spied on while casually
trying to run a few errands. Not only is this an
invasion of our personal privacy as shoppers,
but it also opens up a door to a scary future.
In that future, huge corporations and retailers
have complete access to our personal informa-
tion and background. Yes, companies should
work to achieve the best customer service pos-
sible, but taking it this far is a breach of indi-
vidual liberty and our independence.
Sarah Skaluba is an LSA sophomore.

et me just start with this: Iam
not a big fan of huge, for-prof-
it corpo-
rations.
There are
many reasons
why I feel this
way - and I
would love to
discuss these at
length with any
of you. Yes, even YONAH
you, College LEBERMN
Libertarians.
Don't get the
wrongidea. Iunderstand the benefits
of capitalism, especially in this tech-
nology-rich age. Capitalism incentiv-
izes new and better ideas. In turn,
those ideas improve our society in
major ways.
But frankly, anyone who doesn't
find fault with at least some aspects
of capitalism needs to step back and
look again.
To me, its main fault is that it's
a system where companies define
success entirely on their bottom
line - have they made more money
than their competition. This leads
to an approach where profits often
take priority over people.
But this column is not meant to
simply bash corporate greed. It is
meant to show how the system can
function morally.
With the rise of the Occupy Wall
Street movement, there has been a
heightened awareness of many of
the corporation's immoral actions.
As someone who both identifies
strongly with the Occupy move-
ment and has rallied against large
for-profit corporations for years,
this news is refreshing to me.
I recently came across an article
on the website wakeup-world.com
entitled, "Five Companies that Did
Something Positive for the World in
2011." Needless to say, I was skepti-
cal.

Most large corporations these
days have some sort of social initia-
tive or charity fund. While some may
argue that this reveals the true mor-
als of the leadership, I realistically
view these meaningless initiatives
simply as ways to win social capital
and improve their reputation.
And yet, I was impressed with
the article. Ice cream chain Ben and
Jerry's released a statement in sup-
port of the Occupy movement way
back in October. Outdoor outfitter
Patagonia introduced an anti-con-
sumerist campaign called "Don't
Buy This Jacket." The trendy cloth-
ing store H&M pledged to have all
of its cotton come from sustainable
sources by 2020. The computer
giant Hewlett-Packard has used its
power to lobby against the use of
conflict minerals in their products.
And Method Products has released
the greenest laundry detergent to
ever hit shelves.
These five companies are by no
means perfect. They are, however,
changing - or attemptingto change
- corporate America. I find hope in
the efforts in these companies.
It may seem obvious, but with the
exception of Patagonia, whose cam-
paign to literally not sell their prod-
ucts is either suicidal or incredibly
inspiring, these corporations are
only seen as "good" because their
competition is so damn bad.
For example, while HP paved
the way to advocate against conflict
minerals, major companies such
as Toshiba and Canon came in last
place according to the organization
Raise Hope for Congo.
I shed light on these initiatives not
because I am getting paid by them
(though, if you're listening Ben and
Jerry's, I would appreciate a few
cartons of Phish Food), but because
I want to do my part to shift the con-
versation around corporations.
As socially conscious consumers,

it's all too easy to spend all of our
time exposing immoral practices of
large corporations and screaming
about it. I doit all the time. Let's not
beat around the bush - there is a lot
to expose.
However, we cannot just criti-
cize bad policies, we must propose
an alternative. These five compa-
nies shed light onto the world as it
could be.
We must hold
corporations to
higher standards.
If we spend our time promoting
these great initiatives, large corpo-
rations will see this and - in their
own self-interest - begin to adopt
similar programs.
There is the danger of being co-
opted for our ideals. As I stated
earlier, most major corporations
already have social initiatives, albeit
meaningless ones. There is a fine line
between those and the truly produc-
tive ones highlighted in the article.
But if we stay educated and keep
the pressure on these companies,
we can ensure that programs and
initiatives have meaning.
Yes, we must hold corporations
to higher standards. We, their con-
sumers, hold all the cards. But we
must also be able to point to spe-
cific policies that these companies
should adopt.
We need to build up what we
seek to break down. Only then will
a just society exist.

Mersol-Barg acknowledged
that he and Singh met in Decem-

"I wanted to focus on specific stu-

Singh said some of her indi-

the financial aid process more
streamlined and bringing more
job fairs to campus, noting that
Mersol-Barg didn't value these
goals, and others like them, as
highly as she does.

According to the source, about
three or four days after the MFor-
ward convention, Singh offered
Hashwi a CSG executive board
position in return for supporting
her presidential campaign, but he
turned it down.
The source said Hashwi was
astronomers would need to use a
telescope that is 30 times stronger
that the models they typically use
to view the distant galaxy, Sharon
said.
Sharon and her team are able
to view some of these galaxies
through the Hubble Space Tele-
scope. She said it is possible to
determine which galaxies are
being multiplied because they
have very similar shapes, sizes
and colors but are located dif-
ferently in the image the team
recently discovered.
"It's interesting for us in sev-
eral ways, (if) you know what to
look for, and you apply the right
equations ... you can actually mea-
sure the piece of mass that's in the
center that forms the lens" Sharon
says.
Physics Prof. Fred Adams said

approached because of the name
recognition he has across the Uni-
versity.
"Shreya knows that Omar is
well-known on campus and has
proven to be a powerful vote get-
ter," the source said. "She is also
aware of his many accomplish-
ments at the University and (that)
is why she wanted him to be her
Vice President."
According to the source, six or
seven people knew about Singh's
campaign before it was pub-
licly announced, including a few
MForward members and Mersol-
Barg. About 10 or 15 people knew
about Mersol-Barg's campaign
prior to his official announce-
ment. Hashwi confirmed these
estimates to be correct.
The source added that Singh
did not immediately announce
her campaign for competitive rea-
sons.
"In politics, people usually kind
of wait 'til the last minute and
kind of surprise people because
they don't want (their opponents)
to get a head start on them," the
source said.
images of planets are discovered
frequently every year, but noted
this image is unique.
"It's more lined up ... in such a
way that you get more informa-
tion than usual, so that's more
rare ... this is one of the better ones
in history," Adams said.
Sharon said she takes the dis-
torted image and uses a sequence
of equations to predict what the
background galaxy looks like,
adding that some images are hard-
er to decipher than others.
"When you start with some-
thing like this, you try to solve a
puzzle, and all the pieces to fall
together," she said. "Some puzzles
are easier than others just because
a picture looks a little bit different,
not because the pieces are bigger
or smaller or anything ... it all falls
in to place."

architect Bill Smith of Kraemer
Design Group.
"The space as it is right now
has a lot of character to it ... it's a
small little storefront but it's got
a lot of character already," Smith
said. "What we're trying to do is
work with that. We're not trying
to hide it or compete with it. The
space itself can be really beauti-
ful."
Goldsmith added that he
hopes the shop will become a
unique mainstay in the commu-
nity.
"It's the simplicity of the
Wafel Shop that will set the
restaurant apart from its many
competitors," Goldsmith wrote.
The shop will be open from 7
a.m. to 10 p.m., and Goldsmith
wrote that he hopes the flexible
hours will inspire costumers to
come for waffles at all times of
the day, not just in the morning.
"We're not trying to be all
things to all people - we want
to produce one item better than
anyone else. We also don't see
The Shop as serving only break-
fast - you could eata Wafel as a
meal or a snack any time of the

day," he wrote.
Despite the Wafel Shop's
sweet offerings and convenient
hours, nearby restaurants said
they aren't worried that the
new restaurant will negatively
impact their breakfast business.
Tom Hackett, owner of After-
noon Delight on East Liberty
Street located right around the
corner from the new shop, said
he does not anticipate Wafel
Shop to pose a threat.
"It won't affect our business,"
Hackett said. "It's just another
restaurant coming to town.
We've got plenty of them."
Afternoon Delight began clos-
ing at 3 p.m. approximately 10
years ago, and Hackett said he
doesn't foresee the restaurant
hours changing even with Wafel
Shop now offering late night fare
for customers.
Accordingto Steve Vangelatos,
owner of Angelo's Restaurant
on East Catherine Street, Wafel
Shop is located too far from away
from his business for it to experi-
ence a negative impact.
He said Angelo's won't be as
greatly affected as downtown
restaurants due to its "isolated"
location, adding that the two
businesses will likely experience
different clientele.

"(We primarily serve) Univer-
sity people and people that drive
here," Vangelatos said. "I can't
imagine (Wafel Shop) is going to
affect us."
Wafel Shop's longer hours
also do not seem to be a concern
for Vangelatos. Like Afternoon
Delight, Angelo's was previ-
ously open late into the evening
many years ago, but the long days
meant Angelo's staff had little
time for family life.
After its time change, Van-
gelatos said Angelo's became one
of the first breakfast places of its
kind in Ann Arbor and he doesn't
think the business model will
ever change.
"It's just something I don't
think we're ever going to do.
We're busy enough when we're
open," he explained.
While other local businesses
may not be worried about the
effect, students, including LSA
senior Rae Underwood, said they
are looking forward to the open-
ing of the shop.
"(Waffles) are a very good
dessert. I would make them for
dessert in the dining hall a lot,"
Underwood said.
Underwood added that she
believes the new restaurant will
be successful downtown.

Two Western journalists die
in intense shelling in Syria


Veteran American
reporter, French
photographer
killed in Homs
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian gun-
ners pounded an opposition
stronghold where the last dis-
patches from a veteran Amer-
ican-born war correspondent
chronicled the suffering of
civilians caught in the relent-
less shelling. An intense morn-
ing barrage killed her and a
French photojournalist - two
of 74 deaths reported yesterday
in Syria.
"I watched a little baby die
today," Marie Colvin told the
BBC from the embattled city of
Homs on Tuesday in one of her
final reports.
"Absolutely horrific, a 2-year
old child had been hit," added
Colvin, who worked for Brit-
ain's Sunday Times. "They
stripped it and found the shrap-
nel had gone into the left chest
and the doctor said, 'I can't do
anything.' His little tummy just
kept heavinguntil he died."
Colvin and photographer
Remi Ochlik were among a
group of journalists who had
crossed into Syria and were
sharing accommodations with
activists, raising speculation

that government forces target-
ed the makeshift media center,
although opposition groups had
previously described the shell-
ing as indiscriminate. At least
two other Western journalists
were wounded.
Hundreds of people have
died in weeks of siege-style
attacks on Homs that have come
to symbolize the desperation
and defiance of the nearly year-
old uprising against President
Bashar Assad.
The Syrian military appears
to be stepping up assaults to
block the opposition from gain-
ing further ground and political
credibility with the West and
Arab allies. Yesterday, helicop-
ter gunships reportedly strafed
mountain villages that shelter
the rebel Free Syrian Army, and
soldiers staged door-to-door
raids in Damascus, among other
attacks.
The bloodshed and crack-
downs brought some of the
most galvanizing calls for the
end of Assad's rule.
"That's enough now. The
regime must go," said French
President Nicolas Sarkozy after
his government confirmed the
deaths of Colvin, 56, and Och-
lik, 28.
The U.S. and other countries
have begun to cautiously exam-
ine possible military aid to the
rebels. U.S. Secretary of State

Hillary Rodham Clinton heads
to Tunisia for a meeting tomor-
row of more than 70 nations to
look at ways to assist Assad's
opponents, which now include
hundreds of defected military
officers and soldiers.
"This tragic incident is anoth-
er example of the shameless bru-
tality of the Assad regime," U.S.
State Department spokeswoman
Victoria Nuland said of the kill-
ingof the journalists.
In Saudi Arabia, the state
news agency described King
Abdullah scolding Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev
- one of Assad's few remain-
ing allies - for joining China in
vetoing a U.N. Security Coun-
cil resolution this month con-
demning the violence.
But even Moscow said the
ongoing bloodshed adds urgen-
cy for a cease-fire to allow talks
between his regime and oppo-
nents.
Washington had strongly
opposed arming anti-Assad
forces, fearing it could bring
Syria into a full-scale civil war.
Yet the mounting civilian death
tolls - activists reported at
least 74 across Syria yesterday
- has brought small but poten-
tially significant shifts in U.S.
strategies. It remains unclear,
however, what kind of direct
assistance the U.S. would be
willing to provide.

George Huguely V, left, is escorted into the Charlottesville Circuit courthouse in Charlottesville, Va., yesterday.
Huguely con victd of
second degree -muder

Former Virginia
lacrosse player found
guilty of slaying
girlfriend
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.
(AP) - Jurors found a former
University of Virginia lacrosse
player guilty of second-degree
murder yesterday in the drunk-
en, jealousy-fueled slaying of his
ex-girlfriend, rejecting a verdict
of first-degree murder and a pos-
sible life sentence.
George Huguely V, 24, stood,
flanked by his attorneys, as jurors
returned the verdict after about
nine hours of deliberations. He
was convicted in the slaying of
Yeardley Love, who was found
bloodied, beaten and bruised
in the bedroom of her Charlot-
tesville apartment in the early
morning hours of May3, 2010.
Huguely displayed no emotion
as the verdict was read. Sobbing
could be heard in the courtroom
filled with family and friends of
Love and Huguely.
Jurors who returned the ver-
dict immediately began delib-
erating a sentence, which will
include punishment for a grand

larceny charge the jury also
found him guilty on. The second-
degree murder conviction calls
for a sentence of 5 to 40 years,
while grand larceny's sentencing
range is 1 to 20 years. Formal sen-
tencing will occur at a later date.
Prosecutors said Huguely, of
Chevy Chase, Md., killed the
U.Va. women's lacrosse player
after a day of golf and binge
drinking, incensed that she had
had a relationship with a North
Carolina lacrosse player. Love's
right eye was bashed in and she
was hit with such power that
her brain was bruised. She also
had wrenching head injury that
caused bleeding at the base of her
brain stem.
A coroner concluded she died of
blunt force trauma. Defense and
prosecutionexperts offered differ-
ent medical opinions on the lethal
consequences of her injuries.
Prosecutor Dave Chapman,
who described the night Love
was killed as a scene from a hor-
ror show, said Huguely kicked a
hole in Love's door to get in her
bedroom and left his on-again,
off-again girlfriend to die.
Huguely's attorneys said he
only went to Love's apartment to
talk before the encounter quick-
ly turned physical. He said she

banged her head against the wall
of her bedroom, and she only had
a bloody nose when he left.
A prosecution witness testi-
fied Love smothered in her own
blood-dampened pillow.
Love's mother, Sharon, tear-
fully testified during the sen-
tencing phase as Huguely cast his
gaze down at the defense table.
She described the death of her
daughter as "unbearable."
"Every year that goes by I'd
like to know what she'd be doing
now," Sharon Love said.
Love's sister, Lexie, 28,
described the absence of her kid
sister.
"A song will come on the radio
and I'll just burst out in tears," she
said, sobbing. Her sister's death,
she said, "left a large hole and
nothing will fill it."
The defense did not present
any witnesses at the sentencing
hearing.
"No person is the sum of the
worst decision he ever made,"
one of Huguely's defense attor-
neys, Rhonda Quagliana, told
jurors before they began deliber-
ating his punishment.
The jury of seven men and five
women heard from nearly 60 wit-
nesses over nine days to deter-
mine what happened to Love.

After bipartisan debate, Obama
signs payroll tax cut extension

$143 billion
measure continues
jobless benefits
WASHINGTON (AP) -
PresidentfBarack Obamasigned
the payroll tax cut extension
into law yesterday, notching an
election-year victory and rare
bipartisan agreement in the
continuing partisan battle over
jobs, taxes and debt.
The $143 billion measure
that Congress passed over-
whelmingly yesterday con-
tinues the 2 percentage-point

reduction in the tax that funds
Social Security, a cut begun
last year to aid the nation's
struggling economic recovery.
It also extends jobless benefits
for between 63 weeks and 73
weeks, and averts a big cut
in the reimbursements doc-
tors get for treating Medicare
patients.
The president signed the
measure without ceremony
yesterday, having already cel-
ebrated its passage at an event
Tuesday at the White House.

House their stories about how
losing the tax cut would affect
their lives.
"Extending the payroll tax
cut was a critical step for mid-
dle class families, but we still
have a lot more work to do. So
get ready," Plouffe wrote in an
email that included a photo-
graph of Obama signing the bill
at his Oval Office desk.
The payroll tax cut became
a centerpiece of the jobs plan
Obama unveiled in September
- and of a re-election strategy
that seeks to cast his GOP foes
as protectors of the rich and
out oftouchwiththe worries of
working families.
The administration esti-
mates that for a worker earning
50,000 a year, the tax holiday
means $80 a month in extra
take-home pay. For better-paid
employees, the bonus could
total $2,200 a year.
But the cost to the deficit is
substantial: another $93 billion
for the latest extension. How-
ever, bowing to its inevitability,
House GOP leaders last week
agreed not to demand spending
cuts to offset the lost tax rev-
enues.
The legislation also extend-
ed benefits for the long-term
unemployed that average about
$300 a week, though Obama
and Democratic allies compro-
mised over an initial demand
for 99 more weeks. Those ben-
efits will be paid for by auction-
ing broadcast frequencies and
requiring newly hired federal
workers to contribute more to
their pensions.
Obama maintained that both
extensions are crucial to sup-
porting a still-fragile recovery
from the nation's deepest reces-
sion since the 1930s.
GOP leaders initially balked
at the extensions, then clashed
with Obama and congressio-
nal Democrats over how to
pay for them. As the holidays
approached in December, their
opposition drew a fierce pub-
lic backlash, especially when
House Republicans rejected a
compromise that Senate lead-
ers had brokered. In the end,
Republicans accepted a two-
month extension - after paying
a heavy political price.
"We did not want to repeat
the debacle," Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said. "We're dumb, but
we're not stupid."
The extension puts off until
December - after the presiden-
tial and congressional elections
- a mix of taxing and spending
decisions, including whether
to extend Bush-era tax cuts,
increasing the debt ceiling and
meeting a trillion-dollar spend-
ing cut requirement.

Freshmen pitchers
dominate early on

Senior guard Zack Novak said John Shurna, Northwestern's all-time leading scorer, deserves an NCAA Tournament appearance this season.
Breaking down the Big Ten race

'M' registered four
shutouts in five
games in Florida
last weekend
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
It looked like it was going to
be a long weekend for the Mich-
igan women's softball team
when it was handed its first
loss of the season in a 7-3 game
against Maryland at the FAU
Kickoff Classic in Boca Raton,
Fla.
It didn't end the way it began.
The 11th-ranked Wolverines
(8-1) ended the tournament
with four straight shutouts,
including one over then-No. 22
Kentucky on Saturday.
After losing All-American
right-hander Jordan Taylor to
graduation last season, pitch-
ing was not supposed to be
a strength coming into the
season. But, led by the team's
freshmen pitching duo left-
hander Haylie Wagner and
right-hander Sara Driesenga,
Michigan's pitching could not
be stopped.
"The pitchers on this team
are' so different from each
other," Driesenga said. "They
lost Jordan lastyear - we aren't
Jordan, but together we are all a
little bit different and together
we can be effective."
Wagner led the way at the
FAU Kickoff Classic, going 2-0
on the weekend while pitching
14 scoreless innings. Against
LIU Brooklyn on Friday, she
notched her first shutout, allow-
ing just two hits while striking
out four. She followed up that
performance with an excellent
outing agains the more impres-
sive Wildcats.
On Monday, Wagner was
named Big Ten Pitcher and
Freshman of the Week.
"Our hope is (Wagner) keeps
getting better and keeps devel-
oping her pitches," said Michi-

gan coach Carol Hutchins.
"She's going to continue to get
opportunities to improve."
Wagner's award marked the
second consecutive week that a
member of the Wolverine pitch-
ing staff was honored by the
Big Ten. On Feb. 13, Driesenga
was awarded Co-Freshman of
the Week honors after her five-
inning no-hitter against then-
No.22 LSU.
Driesenga struggled. to pick
up where she left off from her
performance against the Tigers
and gave up 12 hits and seven
runs in a 7-3 loss to the Terra-
pins this past Friday. But she
found her groove on Saturday
against Florida Atlantic, giving
up just five hits and striking out
two without allowing a walk.
"(Wagner will)
continue to get
opportunities to
improve."
"In the first game, against
Maryland, I was just slow,"
Driesenga said. "I wasn't really
finishing up pitches as well as
I should have been and that's
what I fixed in the game on Sat-
urday."
Along with Driesenga and
Wagner, junior right-hander
Stephanie Speierman added to
the pitching staff's momentum
when she recorded her second-
career shutout in a 4-0 rout of
Wright State in the last game of
the tournament.
"We all have to step up," Dri-
esenga said. "We have to have a
one-pitch focus (because) every
pitch matters. If we make a mis-
take, it's going to come back and
bite us."
Who knows, maybe the Wol-
verines will earn their third
straight Big Ten pitching award
when the weekend's over.

Daily Sports Writer
When Michigan State won a
share of the Big Ten football cham-
pionship two years ago, Michigan
fans were quick
to point out that NOTEBOOK
the Spartans
split the crown. Due to tiebreak-
ers, Michigan State was sent to
the Capitol One Bowl as the con-
ference's No. 3 team, behind Ohio
State and Wisconsin.
But in two weeks, Wolverine
fans may be on the other end of
the joke from Spartan fans thanks
to their school's basketball team.
Michigan currently sits in sec-
ond place in the Big Ten, tied with
the Buckeyes and a game behind
Michigan State.
Following the Wolverines' win
over Northwestern on Tuesday,
most analysts have tabbed Michi-
gan's remaining schedule the
easiest of the three frontrunners.
The team - which hosts Purdue
on Saturday, before road contests
at Illinois and Penn State - will
likely be favored in each of its final
games.
The Spartans and Buckeyes
will square off on March 4, mean-
ing one of them won't win out.
Michigan State will also be put to
the test on Feb. 28 at Indiana. Ohio
State still has tilts with the Bad-
gers and Wildcats before heading
to East Lansing.
In the event that the three
teams finish tied atop the stand-
ings, Michigan will automatically
lose the tiebreaker for the confer-
ence tournament's top seed to the
Spartans. Because the teams split
their two matchups, the next pro-
cedure states, "each tied team's
record shall be compared to the

team occupying the highest posi-
tion in the ... standings."
Wisconsin currently sits in
fourth place, and since the Spar-
tans swept the Badgers, they'd win
the tiebreaker. Even though Mich-
igan beat Wisconsin in the teams'
only matchup, Michigan State's
two wins would edge Michigan in
the follow-up tiebreaker.
If fifth-place Indiana finishes
the season ahead of the Badgers,
Michigan State will still win the
tiebreaker. Should the Spartans
beat the Hoosiers later this month,
they'll have swept Indiana, which
split its series with Michigan. If
Michigan State loses in Blooming-
ton, the next tiebreaker looks at
the comparison of the two teams
against the standings' next team,
Wisconsin, which the Spartans
hold the tiebreaker over.
For those reasons, if the Wol-
verines finish in a two-way tie
for first with Michigan State, the
Spartans would receive the No. 1
seed.
If a tie were to occur, Michi-
gan's best shot for the top seed
would be to finish tied with just
Ohio State. The Buckeyes also
split with Indiana, so the deciding
tiebreaker would come down to
the Ohio State's matchup with the
Badgers this Sunday.
If Ohio State wins, it would be
2-0 against Wisconsin - better
than Michigan's 1-0 record. If the
Badgers win, the Wolverines' per-
fect record would trump the split,
giving Michigan its first No.1seed
in program history.
Regardless of how things shake
out, the Wolverines are on pace
to at least match their highest
seeding ever, No. 3, which came
in 2003. And barring a complete
collapse, combined with vari-

ous other scenarios taking place,
Michigan will receive its second-
consecutive first-round bye.
BALL IN BURKE'S HAND: In
one of the most crucial moments
from Michigan's win on Tues-
day in Evanston, the final play of
regulation, freshman point guard
Trey Burke missed a would-be
game winner. It was one of the
only times all night when he made
a mistake.
That's because, as he's done all
season, Burke played with poise
and control - limiting his turn-
overs to just two.
The Wildcats and their com-
plex 1-3-1 defense have a propensi-
ty for forcing turnovers, especially
in recent home games. In its pre-
vious two games in Welsh-Ryan
Arena, Northwestern has forced,
on average, a staggering 18 turn-
overs. Though the rare defensive
formation doesn't stifle Michi-
gan like some others teams - the
Wolverines also employ the 1-3-1
- a freshman playing 45 minutes
in intimidating road conditions
would be expected to have more
than two turnovers.
But he didn't, and Michigan
turned the ball over just seven
times all game.
"A very good Minnesota team
came in and had 21 turnovers the
other day, and it was really the
key to that game," said Michigan
coach John Beilein, referencing
the Wildcats win over the Golden
Gophers. "You cannot turn the
ball over against this team, and
they're good at doing that against
some teams, so I liked our poise -
and Trey's obviously got the ball
most of the time.
"The seven turnovers is huge -
that we only had that many."
But even the stoic Burke came

up rattled on that final possession
of regulation.
With Michigan inbounding
with only a few seconds left in
regulation, Beilein said Burke
made the wrong read, forcing him
to heave up a long, desperation
3-point attempt at the buzzer.
"We wanted him to turn the
corner and make something hap-
pen," Beilein said. "He stopped.
He should've just continued to go
on to the other side, or throw back
to Zack when they double-teamed
him, and he missed both of them."
But Burke didn't dwell on the
error for long. The Columbus
native re-established himself
quickly, draining a three in the
opening minute of overtime. The
Wolverines never looked back.
NOVAK EMPATHIZES WITH
NORTHWESTERN: Even in the
thrill of victory, senior guard Zack
Novak expressed sympathy for the
Wildcats and their star forward
John Shurna.
"I was talking to John after-
wards and I just told him, 'We've
been in this spot before,' where
we had our backs against the wall
where they're at and strung off
a couple at the end and got in,"
Novak said. "That kid, he deserves
toplayinthe NCAA Tournament."
Northwestern has never made
an NCAA Tournament, and with
Shurna - the Wildcats' all-time
leading scorer - due to graduate,
this season may be the program's
best opportunity in the coming
years.
"Being a senior, playing against
him for four years, he does it the
right way - really nice kid,"
Novak said. "Personally, for them,
I hope they can go out and win the
next three and get in the tourna-
ment. I think they deserve that."

Wolverines return to Florida for
third warm-weather tournament

Michigan faces
four teams it
shut out in last
matchup together
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
For the second consecutive
weekend, the Michigan softball
team will travel to Florida to play
five games.
After suffering its first loss
of the season against Maryland
last Friday, the 12th-ranked
Wolverines (8-1) reeled off four
consecutive shutout victories,
besting LIU Brooklyn, then-No.
22 Kentucky, Florida Atlantic
and Wright State on the backs of
a young pitching corps.
"The pitchers have a part,
their job is to contain the oppo-
nent's offense," said Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins.

In their last four wins, the

The game that will draw the
most attention this weekend will
be the Wolverines' matchup with
No. 17 Louisiana-Lafayette on
Saturday.
The Ragin' Cajuns are 7-0 and
are the highest-ranked team the
Wolverines will have played so
far this season.
Though Michigan is in its
35th season and has an all-time
record of 1,380-514-4 against 183
different opponents, Louisiana-
Lafayette is one of the 19 schools
that hold a winning record
against the Wolverines.
While the Ragin' Cajuns's
5-4 record against Michigan is a
noteworthy and remarkable fact,
Hutchins has other things on her
mind.
"We just want everybody to
do their part," Hutchins said.
"If everyone does their part,
we have a great chance to win
games."

Junior defenseman Lee Moffie tallied four points last weekend against Northern Michigan and now leads Michigan with 29 total points of offense.

Moffie
By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
It's October. Imagine you
have some gambling tenden-
cies - which, of course, you
don't - and are taking a look at
the Michigan hockey team. You
want to place a bet on who is
going to be leading the Wolver-
ines in points in late February.
You would have looked at the
forwards first, maybe at senior
David Wohlberg and junior
Chris Brown. But you don't want
to limit yourself, so you take a
gander at junior A.J. Treais and
sophomore Luke Moffatt, and
throw in a freshman, Phil Di
Giuseppe.
If you want this list to be truly
comprehensive, you'll need to
pick out a defenseman, just for
kicks.
You'd probably look to senior
defenseman Greg Pateryn, the
No.1 defenseman.
It's now late February, and
you want to collect your money.
But thanks to Lee Moffie, you
aren't going to see any of it. Not
a cent.
The junior defenseman has
been on a tear the last month,

campaign with a sweep over rival

Wednesday.
The Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten,
6-3 overall) started and ended
strong, dominating Michigan
Stace (0-1, 6-2) in both the doubles
and singles competitions.
"This is a good start. tt feels
good to get our first Big Ten win
of the season," said Michigan
coach Ronni Bernstein.
Michigan started its doubles
competition with an 8-2 vic-
tory by the freshman-sophomore
duo of Emina Bektas and Brooke
Bolender.
The Wolverines clinched their
first point of Wednesday's match
when Michigan senior Michelle
Sulahian and junior Mimi Nguy-
en won 8-4.
Bolender, ranked No. 56, cap-
tured the second point for Michi-
gan when she won her singles
bout in straight sets.
No. 5 Bektas remained unde-
feated on the season when she
defeated Spartan junior Nicole
Herzog in straight sets to capture
Michigan's third point.
Bektas has been playing at a
very high level over the duration
of the season, moving up in the
national rankings from No. 36 to
No. 5 over the course of only a
month.
Bernstein does not think that
has effected Bektas's mindset
though.
"Bektas is a great team player,
and I don't think she's too focused
on her ranking." Bernstein added
"She's working on stuff in prac-
tice.
"She's gaining confidence with
every game she plays."

That flexibility in handling

"Her return is
big for us ... one

players."
Sophomore Sam Critser won
in her return to singles play. Out
since October with a knee inju-
ry, Critser returned to doubles
last week in the ITA Tourna-
ment.
"It feels great to be back on
the court," Critser said. "
I still have a little to work on,
but right now it's all building my
confidence back and working on
hitting the shots I'm used to hit-
ting."
Senior Michelle Sulahian and
freshman Kristen Dodge round-
ed out the sweep with victories
of their own.
The Wolverines have shown
a lot of promise through their
sixth win of the season.
With big victories against
then-No. 15 Clemson and then-
No. 18 Vanderbilt, the Wolver-
ines look like they will be fierce
competitors down the stretch of
the conference season. A deci-
sive sweep over Michigan State
wasn't a bad way to get started.
The Wolverines will play
their first outdoor match of
the season when they take on
Hawaii in Honolulu on March 3.

recent weeks
due to a string of conference loss-
es toward the end of the season.
From mid-December to the end
of January, Purdue was riding
high on an 11-0 run. But in the
last six games they've seemed
to fall apart. Their last win was
against Illinois two weeks ago at
home.
"Purdue is big, they're athlet-
ic, they're fast, and they're very
talented all around," said Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth. "They
started the year on top of the con-
ference, but they took a bad slide.
Things have been a little bit dif-
ficult for them as of late."
Indeed, the Boilermakers are
big. Four of their five starters are
over 6-feet-tall. This may spell
trouble for Michigan, whose
starting center, junior Rachel
Sheffer is just 6-foot-1. Regardless
of their height, Sheffer has been
one of the team's leading scorers

struggled underneath, the Wol-
verines have come out on top by
looking to their outside shooters
to put points on the board.
"It's going to be a hard match-
up for us with their size," Borseth
said. "We obviously have to be
ready to go. It's going to be a big
game for everyone in the confer-
ence at this point in the year."
Aside from being a tough
matchup, this will also poten-
tially be the last game in the
Crisler Center for Michigan's
three senior guards - Courtney
Boylan, Carmen Reynolds and

Jamillya Hardley. For them, it's
going to be a night of celebration
and retrospection. For the young-
er members, it will be a reminder
that one day they will no longer
be able to call on the promise of
next season. Borseth believes that
this notion will give his team the
edge they will need to win.
"Senior night is generally an
emotional night, especially for
our three seniors," Borseth said.
"We're expecting a lot of high
energy, and being at home will
help us. It's a great night to honor
our seniors and the work they've
put in all four years."

INTERACTIVE DESIGN
From Page 1B
the 20th century - it has shaped
the world we know. But we're in
the 21st century now, and design
has expanded beyond the indus-
trial and into newer disciplines.
Designing the future
Marshall outlined three of
these new forms of design that
students are beginning to work
with. There is "user-centered
design," which analyzes and tests
the behavior of use in product
design. There is also "experience
design," which considers group
or individual needs across a wide
range of disciplines. And there
is "emotionally durable design,"
which answers questions of obso-
leteness, such as "why do users
discard products that still work?"
Marshall described that the
term "industrial design" cannot Robert

elements of design. Instead, Mar- lines s

However, we owe the "tra-

education to the German

facilitate this unification,
ruhaus curriculum began
a six-month preparatory
hat "trained" the senses,
ms and the mind first in
sciplines and then in 3-D
ctives. Following this,
its of the Bauhaus began a
year track of specialization
ss, stone, textiles, wood,

etc., before being apprenticed
to a set of masters. After train-
ing, a Bauhaus student often had
considerable exposure but only
a single technical craft, and the
era of the specialized industrial
designer was born.
According to Marshall, the
School of Art & Design mimics
these Bauhaus principles to an
extent. This, he suggests, can be
seen in the early undergradu-
ate requirements and in the
school's single Bachelor of Fine
Arts degree. However, Marshall
explains that because the pro-
gram becomes increasingly fluid
and open in the later years of the
curriculum, the structure is actu-
ally a hybrid model that takes the
most important components of
the Bauhaus model and adjusts
them for the 21st-century class-
room.
In the School of Art & Design,
the core classes break down into
four major programs distributed
over the first two years of under-
graduate work. Students begin
with Fundamentals of Drawing,
which covers the mechanics of
the craft - technical drawing,
design drawing, illustration and
life-drawing - in a manner very
similar to the Bauhaus model.
Next, students take Digital Stu-
dio, in which they learn about
2-D and 3-D computer design and
manipulation by following a simi-
lar program of drafting and pro-
gramming.
"The effect of all this core
work is to teach students to think
visually across different tech-
niques," said Joann McDaniel,
assistant dean for undergradu-
ate programs. "The core material
teaches a language of technique
that aims to change a designer's
perspective through a range of
materials and processes."
But some professors at the
School of Art & Design think this
curriculum is not enough for new
designers.
Their ideas stem from Don-
ald Norman, whose work with
design theory is respected as
some of the most progressive
around. The company he co-
founded, the Nielsen Norman
Group, has done design consult-
ing for BMW, UICO and Ness
Computer (the latter two com-
panies work with smartphones
and touchscreens). In addition to
his work at the corporate level,
Norman also travels around
the world, studying design pro-
grams at the collegiate level.
Though he is not connected to
the 'U,' his writing and work has
had an effect on how the School
of Art & Design perceives the
role of the designer.
One of the key issues Norman
cites is the abundance of tech-
nique being taught to students.
His argument is that students
need to be taught technique, but

only to a point.
Instead of mastering a tech-
nique, students need to learn how
to use their technical skills to
solve problems over diverse rang-
es of materials and disciplines,
McDaniel explained.
"It's important that our stu-
dents get a fuller foundation out-
side of just technique," McDaniel
said. "Technique is vital, but it
is not driving design. Design is
driven by solving problems, so
we need to fuel the creativity and
inquiries of our students instead
of bogging them down in material
mastery."
Focusing on this creative
inquiry then, the School of Art &
Design's students transition from
answering questions of form to
solving questions of function.
This shift is paramount to the
future of design, but it comes
with a new set of challenges.
"As the aim of design becomes
more and more about interac-
tions and problem solving, stu-
dents need new ways to view
their work," McDaniel said.
"Assumptions need to be checked
and designers need to consider a
larger picture than just aesthetics
of design."
Marshall explained that these
skills are vital to the development
and organization of students'
own projects. The core studios
that focus on concept, form and
context provide students with
opportunities to develop curios-
ity and rigor, create responses
to open-ended assignments and
develop appropriate criteria for
assessing their own projects. Stu-
dents learn how to make the most
of their studio time, to practice
new skills and, above all, to ask
probing questions.
"We actively encourage stu-
dents to pursue interests out-
side the School of Art & Design,"
McDaniel said. "It just doesn't
make sense to isolate a designer
and artist. We have some of the
best schools all across the board
- music, engineering, science,
literature, sociology, psychol-
ogy - and they all intersect with
industrial design."
The design world of today is
very different from the design
world of the past. As it contin-
ues to change, schools may break
away more and more from the
traditional methodologies that
dictated industrial design in the
now past industrial era. At the
University, the School of Art &
Design has already developed an
important curriculum focused on
the intersection of art and design,
where it both teaches traditional
technique and encourages the
future exploration of form and
function. Industrial design may
become obsolete in the 21st cen-
tury, but the School of Art &
Design may stay ahead of the
curve.

Exploring sounds of obscure instruments

Carillonneurs and
harpsichordists play
outdated tunes
By SAM CENZHANG
Daily Arts Writer
The University's music pro-
gram has its share of world-class
pianists and virtuoso violinists,
but there are plenty of faculty and
students exploring instruments
and sounds with less exposure.
While these instruments are far
from being performed in today's
concert halls, they are important
at the University as ways to gain
a deeper understanding of cur-
rent musical practices.
The sounds of the harpsichord,
a keyboard instrument that gen-
erates sound by plucking strings
rather than hammering them as
the piano does, are alive and well
at the University. It was once the
instrument of choice for profes-
sional and amateur musicians
alike, but it gradually faded from
prominence as the piano gained
popularity.
For harpsichord doctoral can-
didate Francis Yun in the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, the
primary draw of the instrument
was its repertoire. Like most
harpsichord students, Yun had
a strong piano background but
turnedtothe harpsichord because
of his interest in the music.
The harpsichord music of 20th
century composers such as Gyor-
gy Ligeti and Alfred Schnittke
is a big part of why he plays it,
Yun said. Ligeti's and Schnittke's
music represent a neoclassical
approach to music, where musical
forms and styles of the past are
deconstructed to counterbalance
saturated and familiar sounds. In
that vein, many students' paths
to the harpsichord are similarly
motivated.
"I was getting sick of the piano
repertoire, so I looked to the 20th
and 21st centuries as well as way
back to Bach, Handel and even
before that. I just fell in love with
the repertoire, and most of the
music for those chunks of time is
for harpsichord," Yun said.
The harpsichord's plucking
mechanism results in a sharp
and piercing sound, which Yun
describes as an "equalizer," clari-
fying textures and combinations
of sounds and timbres that the
piano cannot. Not only does it
produce a distinctive sound, but
the harpsichord is also a lens
through which to examine music
history.
Historical harpsichord music
isn't limited to the same keyboard
suites with which every pianist is
familiar.
"As I study more, it's 17th cen-
tury composers that are wild and
exciting to play," Yun said. Com-
posers like Girolamo Frescobaldi,
Louis Couperin and William Byrd

The University has two carillons - one on North Campus (pictured) and one in the Burton Memorial Tower - the latter of which is one of the largest of its kind in the world.

were 'unbound by rules' that
marked Bach and Handel's music.
"What Bach did within those
limits was amazing, but the stuff
in the 17th century was a lot wild-
er," Yun said.
One cannot approach harp-
sichord playing without at least
some consideration for histori-
cally informed performance prac-
tice, a school of musical thought
that suggests music should be
played exactly as it was first con-
ceived, on instruments of its eraof
composition.
"By playing the harpsichord,
I'm a part of that," Yun said.
However, he's not necessar-
ily overly concerned with perfect
historical accuracy. He prefers to
make musical choices based on
the music on the page, rather than
following centuries-old style.
"A lot of it is vague and hard to
interpret, and musicians aren't
necessarily the best writers," Yun
said.
Most harpsichord students
come to the harpsichord from
piano, just exploring what's out
there, Yun said, and most people
who pick up the harpsichord
have the same interest in rep-
ertoire. Yun stresses the differ-
ences between harpsichord and
piano in his teaching as well as
playing.
Though the harpsichord draws
easy comparisons to the piano,
Yun conceptualizes them very dif-
ferently. Harpsichord technique
requires a much lighter touch, so
much so that the mechanics of
piano playing are almost forgot-
ten.
"The instruments, by their very
nature, are so different that I feel
like I'm using different parts of
my brain," Yun said.
"I like to get people to just be
able to play one note with good

touch and good sound, and to
realize that it's not the piano.
Most pianists have to get over
the hurdle of wanting the harpsi-
chord to be the piano," Yun said.
From strings to bells
It's difficult to imagine the
carillon as anything other than
what it is, an instrument made up
of bells, played using a keyboard-
esque assembly, with manual pegs
hit with the fist and foot pedals.
While there is a carillon on North
Campus, the carillon in Burton
Memorial Tower - named after
its donor, former Michigan Ath-
letic Director Charles Baird - on
Central Campus contains 56 bells
and is one of the largest in the
world.
"The carillon can be a sig-
nificant part of your memories
of college," said Steven Whiting,
associate dean of graduate stud-
ies in the Music, Theatre & Dance
School, referring to the chimes as
students walk from class to class.
"The sound is an integral part of
campus."
Helping to create that sound
is an eclectic group of carillon-
neurs. LSA senior Kyle Helzer
discovered an introductory caril-
lon class through a promotional
flier, and though he has only
taken the class for two terms, he is
already producing music heard by
the entire campus.
"I had a little bit of a music
background, but I wasn't really
doing anything with music here
on campus. I saw the flier, and I
thought, not many people get to
do that," Helzer said.
Students must prepare 15 min-
utes of material before they can
play on the tower, Helzer said.
Performances last from noon
until 12:30 on weekdays, and

consist of material from sonatas
and dance suites written specifi-
cally for the carillon, as well as
arranged popular melodies.
Richard Giszczak, a safety
officer in the chemistry depart-
ment, has been playing the
carillon for 24 years, and runs
a business that arranges popu-
lar music for the instrument.
According to Giszczak, the caril-
lon is better suited for minor-key
music because of the physical
properties of the bell. But this
doesn't mean it's all doom and
gloom up on the bell tower.
"It's primarily popular stuff,
but I've done a lot of funny things
and fun things. I do the Hallow-
een concert, and that's some pret-
ty goofy music," Giszczak said.
A lot can be gleaned from
unconventional instrument and
composition pairings, goofy or

not. Pius Cheung, a well-known
marimba and xylophone special-
ist, recorded Bach's Goldberg
variations, originally for key-
board. Trombonists often play
Bach's unaccompanied suites for
cello, Prof. Whiting said.
"Imagine all the things trom-
bonists can learn about phras-
ing, legato and counterpoint
from tackling a Bach cello suite,"
Whiting said. In the same vein,
playing Bach on older keyboard
instruments can yield ideas about
articulation and manipulation of
dynamics that pianists can bring
back to the piano.
Obscure instruments, however,
are not simply limited to enrich-
ing pianists' musical style.
"Some people are drawn to be
specialists. There's a fundamental
curiosity about acquiring exper-
tise that's not shared by many

people," Whiting said.
As Whiting explained, there
are two ways to approach the
study of more obscure instru-
ments.
"The question when you're
running a music school is how
specialized you want to get. Are
the earlier instruments there pri-
marily to be ancillary to people
who are focused on piano mainly,
or do you have the resources tc
devote specific academic pro-
grams to early music perfor-
mance?" Whiting said.
The answer to that question
changes from decade to decade.
"I wish that we could answer that
more strongly in the affirmative,"
Whiting said.
He added: "Right now, early
instruments are a crucial
enhancement for students who
are working on other things."

Students and faculty members are able to play the carillon by participating in classes.

Our culture wants to believe
that celebrities are superhuman,
and fans demand a lot from them.

But I say stars are asking for it.
-EDITH FREYER
The death of the Prom Queen
of Soul has reminded me that I
am pro-celebrity privacy. Not to
say that her fans were the death
of her, but there's something real
here in terms of the societal pres-
sures experienced by the stars.
It looked as if all the balloon
shops in the world had vomited
Valentine's Day paraphernalia
onto the streets outside New
Hope Baptist Church on Satur-
day, a week following Whitney
Houston's death and the day
of her funeral. As the golden
hearse carried the deceased pop
star through crowds of people
on MLK Boulevard, love and
remembrance were sincerely
communicated - but when is
it too much? However true and
lovely it is that fans gush their
feelings about Whit's death, it
may also be accurate to say the

pressure of the media - always
linked back to the fans - may
have been a factor in the drug use
that led to her death.
We Americans tend to crush
our celebrities with attention
until they bleed Propofol. Illus-
trious singer Tony Bennett said
it himself at Clive Davis's pre-
Grammy Beverly Hilton party
dedicated to Houston. Bennett's
ballsy commentary about recent
celebrity deaths was reported
in TMZ as follows: "First it was
Michael Jackson, then Amy
Winehouse, now the magnificent
Whitney Houston. Let's legalize
drugs, like Amsterdam, it's a very
sane city now."
Whether or not you agree with
Bennett interms oflegality work-
ing as an effective means for a
safer, saner country where there
are fewer drug-related deaths,
the trend is present and the
deaths of these artists are largely
romanticized. Maybe if they had
more privacy, this wouldn't be a
problem.

US Magazine's "Stars -
They're Just Like US!" feeds the
fuel to America's ever-too-curi-
ous fire. It's not just that celebri-
ties deserve some privacy - they
do - but why are we so invested*
in whether Jessica Alba does her
own grocery shopping or Russell
Crowe picks his nose?
Privacy aside in the case of
Whit, the past is the past, and
Whitney does deserve recogni-
tion for some killer dance tunes.
"I Wanna Dance With Somebody
(Who Loves Me)," recorded in
July of 1986, is such a staple song
that my modern dance teacher
made up a competition jazz com-
bination to it to pay our respects
- and that was a large surprise.
Though I believe iTunes's
decision to raise the prices of her
hit songs by 60 percent less than
an hour after her death and the
vomiting of heart-balloons at her
funeral were both a bit exces-
sive, Houston does deserve some
lovin.'
