GOVERNMENT

Michigan’s 
15 
public 

universities 
requested 
the 

state legislature on Monday to 
postpone voting on a package of 
bills aimed at combating sexual 
assault and expanding survivors’ 
legal rights, citing worry about 
measures 
that 
would 
allow 

more lawsuits to be filed against 
government agencies including 
the universities by giving victims 
more time to file.

The Michigan state Senate 

is scheduled to vote later this 
week on the legislation, which 
was inspired by the recent trial 
of Larry Nassar, a former doctor 
at Michigan State University 
who sexually abused hundreds of 
young patients and students.

The Michigan Association of 

State Universities — of which 
the University is a member — 
the coordinating board for the 
state’s public universities, wrote 
in a letter to lawmakers and Gov. 
Rick Snyder the bills would have 
a “profound impact.”

An analysis from Dykema, a 

law firm commissioned by the 
board, indicated the laws would 
lead to a “significant number” of 
lawsuits against the universities 
and 
other 
organizations, 

including 
governments 
and 

churches, posing a financial risk 
by potentially increasing the 
cost of insurance and negatively 
impacting 
government 
credit 

ratings.

MASU’s CEO Daniel Hurley 

asked for more time to consider 
the effects of the legislation.

“We ask that decisions on 

these bills be delayed to allow 
for more analysis and discussion 
to ascertain their full impact,” 
Hurley wrote in the group’s letter 
to lawmakers.

Currently, 
survivors 
of 

childhood 
sexual 
abuse 
in 

Michigan have until their 19th 
birthdays to file lawsuits. Under 
the proposed legislation, children 
who suffered abuse in 1993 or 
later would be able to sue before 
they turned 48 and adult victims 
of assault would have 30 years to 
file a claim after the fact.

Global Soap Project founder talks 
significance of service in business

Derrick Kayongo, founder of the Global Soup Project and CEO of the Center for Civil and Human Rights, speaks about ethics and his experiences in Uganda, the 
United States, and other countries at Rackham Monday.

Derrick Kayongo ties his experience as a refugee to lessons of believing in others

The Delta Gamma Foundation 

and the University of Michigan 
Office of Greek Life welcomed 
2011 CNN Hero Derreck Kayongo 
Monday evening as the keynote 
speaker for the University’s fourth 
Delta 
Gamma 
Lectureship 
in 

Values & Ethics.

Kayongo’s 
speech 
centered 

on how his personal experiences 
with his family and as a refugee in 
Kenya shaped his desire to establish 

the Global Soap Project, which 
takes donated, reprocessed soap 
from hotels and distributes it to 
communities in need. Along with 
founding the Global Soap Project, 
Kayongo is currently the CEO for 
the Center for Civil and Human 
Rights in Atlanta.

LSA 
sophomore 
Kim 
Ira, 

director of lectureship for the Delta 
Gamma Xi chapter, explained the 
organization 
selected 
Kayongo 

for his humanitarian efforts and 
desire for social change. The 
annual lectureship, endowed in 
2010 by Ann Arbor Delta Gamma 

chapters and alums, is one of 20 
such lectureships which take place 
across the country.

“Derreck embodies a lot of 

humanitarian values and I thought 
his story of social entrepreneurship 
could be something really relevant 
to the Michigan campus because so 
many people here are ambitious and 
driven but they have a social change 
mindset along with this,” Ira said. 
“Derreck’s message, his backstory 
as a refugee, his message of public 
health, social change and a business 
mindset is something that appeals 
to so many people on the Michigan 

campus and it really represents the 
values of Delta Gamma.”

Kayongo began by describing 

how 
his 
parents’ 
professions 

in business fields shaped his 
childhood in Uganda as well the 
various political issues the country 
faced, which eventually led to his 
family fleeing to Kenya. He recalled 
an instance where a firing squad 
began killing people in his village 
and caused him to distrust adults 
because of the damage they could 
cause in an area.

In a budget meeting and 

special 
session 
on 
Monday 

night, Ann Arbor City Council 
discussed incorporating a new 
customer classification for water 
rates, implementing a capital 
financing strategy to address 
issues such as street lighting and 
a compensation increase for the 
City Administrator.

During the budget meeting, 

City 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
Public 

Services proposed plans to create 
a new addition to the customer 
classification system used to 
address affordability in Ann 
Arbor water rates. Water rates 
were previously classified among 
three 
categories: 
Residential, 

non-residential and water only. 
With the new public services 
model, the rates would reflect 
a fourth category; multifamily, 
which, 
according 
to 
Public 

Services Administrator Craig 
Hupy, is a class of customers that 
is easier to serve.

“We identified it as a class that 

is easier to serve,” Hupy said in 
response to a question fielded 
by City Council regarding each 
individual’s ability to pay these 
rates. “We can only look at that, 
we can’t look at what they can 
pay.”

If the new classification goes 

through, about 2,500 accounts 
will be reclassified. During the 
public comment, several Ann 
Arbor residents including Leon 
Bryson expressed their concern 

regarding this new water rate 
plan.

“The resolution is to increase 

the rate so that the residents are 
actually paying what it costs,” 
Bryson said. “If we use this 
model for water rates we are 
setting a model. I’m concerned 
that if we do this, we have to do 
it for all areas of government. 
We can’t just apply it to water. I 
think there needs to be a bit more 
discussion for structuring the 

tiers based on how we use the 
services.”

Explaining their reasoning 

behind this new classification 
and the rate increase, Andrew 
Burnham, vice president and 
practice leader at Stantec, argued 
their proposal was common and 
meets the needs of the data from 
water use.

“We now have a way to serve 

to customer classes and we 
are reflecting that in our rate 

system,” Burnham said. “Now 
we have identified how much we 
use for each customer. Then what 
rate structure fits each customer. 
These are directly proportional 
rates based on the demand per 
cubic feet that these place on the 
system peak demands.”

In addition to discussing water 

rates, Hupy told the council they 
are currently interviewing four 
vendors for the Solid Waste 

In January, the University 

of 
Michigan

Center for the Study of Drugs,

During the 2016-2017 school 

year, the average salary of teachers 
in Michigan increased for the first 
time in five years. The Michigan 
Department 
of 
Education 

reported the average salary of a 
Michigan public school teacher 
was $62,280 this past school 
year, up $405 from the 2015-
2016 school year. Salaries peaked 
during the 2009-2010 school year 
at $63,024, $744 higher than the 
current salary.

As reported by MLive, the 

average teacher’s pay does not 
include benefits, but includes 
extra pay beyond base salary 
including 
longevity 
bonuses, 

compensation for coaching or 
large class size. MLive stated 
lower average salaries in recent 
years were the result of fewer 
raises, wage rollbacks, an increase 
of 
younger, 
less-experienced 

teachers and decrease of older, 
more-experienced teachers (as 
teachers are paid by experience) 
and an increase in charter schools.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
College 
of 

Literature, Science and the 
Arts sent an email Monday to 
prospective transfer students 
congratulating them on their 
acceptance to the University 
and inviting them to LSA’s 
Transfer 
Student 
Days 
in 

April. 
While 
normally 
a 

moment of celebration for most 
students, the email was met 
with confusion and questions 
— students who received the 

email had not heard back in 
an official capacity from a 
University office in regards to 
their admission status at the 
time of LSA’s email.

Addressed 
by 
Transfer 

Recruiting 
Coordinator 

Kristin Heinrich, the email 
was 
reportedly 
sent 
to 

prospective 
students 
still 

waiting 
to 
hear 
if 
their 

transfer to the University was 
accepted or rejected.

“Congratulations on your 

admission to the College of 
Literature, Science, and the 
Arts!” the email read. “I am 
sure this is an exciting time 

for you. Are you interested 
in 
learning 
more 
about 

LSA? Do you want to meet 
current transfer students and 
professionals 
from 
across 

campus who are here to help 
YOU? We invite you to attend 
one of our LSA Transfer 
Student Days in April!”

Prospective 
transfer 

student Paris, who requested 
to remain anonymous as to 
not impact her admissions 
decision, participated in a 
dual-enrollment 
program 

through a local community 
college and took a gap year 
after that year. Instead of 

being able to defer her 
enrollment to universities 
through 
the 
gap 
year 

program, she had to apply 
as a transfer and was 
waiting to hear back when 
she got LSA’s email.

Paris said she noticed 

the first email but then saw 
other students replying to 
LSA’s email saying they 
hadn’t heard from the 
University 
about 
their 

admission status until this 
moment — she was in the 
same situation.

“I check my email every 

hour waiting for colleges 
to get back (to me),” Paris 
said. “But I woke up from 
a nap and refreshed my 
email and saw two new 
emails 
from 
the 
LSA 

College of the University 
of Michigan. The first 
one was ‘Congratulations 
on your acceptance, this 
must be a really exciting 
time for you,’ and the more 
you scroll down (through 
the email chain) the more 
people are like ‘Is this a 
mistake? I don’t have any 

official letter, my application 
status is exactly the same.’”

After 
seeing 
the 
email 

chain, Paris logged on to 
Wolverine Access to check her 
admission status, which was 
still unavailable at the time.

“Right 
when 
I 
opened 

it, I thought this is too 
convenient,” 
Paris 
said. 

“Already, going to Michigan is 

such a dream that to just wake 
up from a random nap and see 
that I got in, I was like hold 
on, I’m a little skeptical. And 
to see that everyone else was 
a little skeptical, I was like 
‘yeah, I’m right.’”

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in 
an email statement the LSA 
email was mistakenly sent to 
prospective students and is 
being handled by LSA.

“LSA accidentally sent an 

email to the wrong group,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “(LSA)...
reached out to the impacted 
students directly.”

LSA admissions email mistakenly sent 
out to prospective transfer students

Message invited students to LSA acceptance event without admissions decision

MATT HARMON

Daily News Editor

“Right when 

I opened it, 

I thought 

this is too 

convenient”


adults destroy our village and 
our country,” Kayongo said. “I 
wondered who are these people, 
when do you become an adult 
who destroys an environment 
in which people must exist. So 
for me, adults were the most 
untrustworthy people you could 
ever meet.”

Eventually, Kayongo’s family 

fled to Kenya as refugees fleeing 
the civil war in Uganda. After 
receiving a scholarship to attend 
Tufts University, Kayongo moved 
to Philadelphia, which became 
the birthplace of his idea for the 
Global Soap Program. Kayongo 
remembered staying in a hotel 
upon his arrival to the U.S, and 
his surprise upon discovering 
800 million bars of used hotel 
soap are thrown away each year.

“Can you imagine delivering 

children as a refugee woman 
and the midwife goes in to 
deliver your child and doesn’t 
wash her hands and leaves you 
with a germ that kills you in two 

weeks?” Kayongo said. “It’s called 
childbed fever. Yet here we are 
in this country with 2 million 
dead children every year to lower 
respiratory disease.”

Kayongo then went on to 

offer 
important 
lessons 
he 

learned while developing the 
Global Soap Project including 
leadership, service, and business. 
He 
explained 
the 
value 
of 

observation, valuing each person 
and their contributions and how 
true leaders are born through 
service.

“A human being who walks 

around 
arrogant, 
and 
they 

assume they know everything 
… They lie because they have 
never been at the ground level 
to understand that housekeeper 
mama, they’ve never been at the 
ground level to see that refugee 
child,” Kayongo said.

He 
also 
tied 
his 
own 

experience to University students 
and explained the importance 
of believing in one another to 
succeed as a unit.

“Remember 
as 
you 
go 

out and finish school here at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

that the only way this school 
becomes permanent in its status 
intellectually … is if you have faith 
in all of us to be part of the story,” 
Kayongo said.

Kinesiology 
and 
Business 

senior Abigail Ruch said she 
resonated 
with 
Kayongo’s 

message 
and 
explained 
she 

appreciated how he was able to 
make his experiences relatable to 
the audience.

“It was really valuable that he 

catered his speech to students,” 
Ruch said. “We have a lot of 
speakers who come in here 
and kind of talk about their 
experiences 
but 
don’t 
really 

understand how they’re going to 
connect it back to their audience. 
I think for him, it was really smart 
not to make himself like a hero 
but make him seem relatable, and 
be like anyone can do this, anyone 
can achieve this.”

Ruch 
also 
discussed 
the 

relationship between Kayongo’s 
efforts and Delta Gamma’s values, 
especially in regards to spending 
time with those in vulnerable 
communities. 

“We’re 
really 
focused 
on 

actually giving our time,” Ruch 
said. “(Delta Gamma is) not 
focused on giving money, and 
that’s a valuable cause, don’t get 
me wrong. I think it’s great that 
we have so many chapters here 
on campus who focus on raising 
money and giving it to a good 
cause. For me, I think the value is 
in going out and doing things and 
meeting people because you’ll 
learn things you’ve never learned 
before.”

Ira shared Ruch’s sentiments 

and discussed how many people 
on the University’s campus can 
relate to what Kayongo had to 
say.

“I really liked his message 

especially that all good leaders 
have engaged in service before,” 
Ira said. “I think all aspects 
of his talk are something that 
every Michigan student can 
take throughout the rest of 
their career here and whatever 
career or passions they pursue 
post-graduation. I think what 
he said about being a leader, an 
active and engaged leader, in 
everything you do with a service 
mindset is so important.”

SACUA

DARBY STIPE/Daily

Senate Advisory Committee on Univeristy Affairs Chair Robert Ortega discusses campus programs and faculty responsibility at the SACUA meeting 
at the Fleming Administration Building Monday.

State Sen. Margaret O’Brien, 

R-Kalamazoo, 
is 
the 
lead 

sponsor of the bills. She said in 
a statement these are “much-
needed protections.”

“It is important that our 

laws protect those who are 
most vulnerable, including our 

children,” O’Brien said. “This 
legislation would put fear into the 
heart of any possible perpetrator. 
Justice must be served.”

The bills would also allow 

victims of childhood sexual abuse 
to remain publicly anonymous 
when bringing a claim in the 
Michigan Court of Claims and 
increase reporting requirements 
for college employees and youth 
sports coaches, making them 
mandatory reporters of child 

abuse. Failing to report could 
result in a felony of up to two 
years imprisonment and/or up to 
a $5,000 fine.

An analysis of the legislation 

by the nonpartisan Senate Fiscal 
Agency said the financial impact 
would be “indeterminate.”

O’Brien told the Associated 

Press 
the 
pushback 
is 

“not 
surprising 
but 
very 

disappointing.”

“I don’t understand what a 

delay would do except delay 
justice, or maybe the hope is to 
stop it entirely,” O’Brien said.

LSA 
freshman 
Morgan 

McCaul was sexually assaulted 
by Nassar when she was 12. On 
Twitter, she berated MASU’s 
request to delay a vote on the bills.

“I am ASHAMED to attend 

a public university in this state,” 
she wrote. “How much is a child 
worth? They’ve just given their 
answer.”

as 
racial 

minorities, women and members 
of the LGBTQ community.

After 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Substance 
Abuse 

Research Center closed in 2016, 
there was a need for a new 
interdisciplinary 
center 
for 

substance use research. Boyd 
then conceptualized the DASH 
center.

In particular, Boyd said she is 

interested in the intersections 
between 
drug 
misuse 
and 

minority 
populations 
and 

believes that the center can work 
toward mitigating these issues.

“Sexual, ethnic and gender 

minorities, 
adolescents, 

pregnant women, veterans and 
the elderly are at highest risk 
for the negative consequences 
of substance use, including HIV, 
injury, birth defects, suicide, 
cancer, and liver disease,” she 
wrote in an email interview. 
“These 
at-risk 
populations 

are the primary focus of the 
DASH 
Center 
scholars; 
we 
 

are 
faculty 
committed 

to 
advancing 
knowledge 

of 
substance 
use 
and 
its 

consequences 
through 

pioneering 
scholarship, 

evidence-based 
prevention, 

innovative clinical training and 
timely public policy and service.”

Stephen Strobbe, a clinical 

associate 
professor 
at 
the 

Nursing School, is a researcher 
affiliated with DASH. He said 
his interest lies in integrating 
substance use screening and 
youth psychiatric care. Strobbe 
is working on a clinical initiative 
supported by a grant from the 
Flinn Foundation to educate and 
train clinicians in adolescent 
psychiatric care.

“The plan is to train members, 

across disciplines from the entire 
clinical team … toward youth 
ages 14 to 18 who are receiving 
inpatient psychiatric care,” he 
wrote in an email interview. 
“Across the lifespan, individuals 
with mental health disorders 
are 
at 
markedly 
increased 
 

risk for lifetime and concurrent 
substance 
use 
and 
related 

disorders, 
which 
otherwise 

complicates care, and leads to 
poorer 
treatment 
outcomes.

hope 
is 
that 
earlier 

identification, 
intervention, 

and treatment may help to 
reduce 
or 
eliminate 
some 
 

(of) these potentially avoidable 
complications, 
leading 
to 

improved outcomes.”

Strobbe 
emphasized 
the 

DASH center is a good place for 
this initiative to happen.

“The 
DASH 
initiative 

allows for robust collaboration 
across 
disciplines 
to 
better 

address issues related to social 

determinants, 
risk 
factors, 

clinical care, and recovery,” he 
wrote.

Yasamin 
Kusunoki, 
an 

assistant 
professor 
in 
the 

Department 
of 
Systems, 

Populations 
and 
Leadership, 

works for the new DASH center. 
Kusunoki explains why taking an 
interdisciplinary look at health 
and substance use is crucial.

“It is important to have a 

variety of voices at the table in 
order to most effectively and 
creatively address these issues,” 
she wrote in an email interview. 
“Individuals 
are 
embedded 

in 
multiple 
interdependent 

social contexts, such as their 
intimate relationships, families, 
and communities, that have 
both short-term and long-term 
consequences for their health. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
important 

that researchers continue to 
investigate 
the 
connection 

between 
social 
factors 
and 

health.”

Similarly, the Addiction Center 

conducts 
multidisciplinary 

research 
on 
vulnerable 

populations such as adolescents, 
pregnant women, older adults 
and veterans.

Angela Galka, an assistant 

to the director of the Addiction 
Center, outlined one of the 
Addiction Center’s major goals: 
Examining 
root 
causes 
of 

substance misuse.

“Specifically, 
one 
of 
our 

major research themes focuses 
on 
the 
identification 
of 

genetic, 
neuropsychological, 

and psychosocial factors that 
contribute to alcohol and drug 
use and/or disorders,” Galka 
said.

Boyd 
explained 
DASH 

offers 
a 
new 
perspective 

as a center because of its 
unique combination of faculty 
 

members. 
Boyd 
herself 
is 
 

also a professor of Women’s 
Studies. 

“As a director of DASH faculty 

I bring together faculty that 
focus on vulnerable populations 
such as sexual minorities and 
youth,” she wrote.

DASH is working toward its 

three-year goals: Establishing 
strong 
connections 
with 

researchers who share in their 
mission 
and 
establishing 
a 

mentorship 
program 
in 
the 

Nursing School. The mentees 
would consist of undergraduates, 
graduates, post-doctorates and 
faculty interested in becoming 
scholars of substance use.

As Boyd looks further into 

the future, she envisions greater 
training in the field.

“The 
long-term 
goal 
is 

to 
increase 
the 
number 
of 

substance 
use 
scholars 
who 

are also nurses, and to build a 
critical mass of substance use 
scholars in schools of nursing,” 
she wrote.

When 
Sandra 
Levitsky, 
an 

associate professor of sociology at 
the University of Michigan, walked 
into a meeting last Thursday, she 
he hadn’t even had her morning 
caffeine yet. She wasn’t expecting 
anything out of the ordinary to 
happen, and she definitely wasn’t 
expecting to be presented with this 
year’s Golden Apple Award.

“It was a surprise,” Levitsky said. 

“I, unfortunately, had not had my 
first hit of caffeine so I was trying 
to process why all of these people 
were walking into my meeting 
from all different parts of my 
professional life. It’s one thing to 
sort of hear the news in the abstract 
and it’s another to actually look 
in the faces of your students. That 
makes it all the more special … This 
is the award that nobody expects! It 

feels impossible.”

Winning the Golden Apple 

Award shows Levitsky not only has 
a love for teaching, but a talent for 
it, too. The honor is the University’s 
only 
student-selected 
faculty 

award, and for the past 28 years, 
professors and lecturers have been 
nominated by their students for 
the prestigious award. This year, 
Levitsky was chosen out of a pool of 
almost 700 nominees.

While in college herself, Levitsky 

didn’t want to go into teaching. She 
comes from a family of teachers, and 
said she “fought the teaching gene” 
by going to law school. But much 
to her chagrin, she found herself 
drawn 
towards 
the 
discipline 

anyway.

“About halfway through law 

school, I had won a best brief 
competition, and the dean asked 
me if I would teach the first year 
legal writing class,” she said. “It’s 
supposed to be a really boring class 

but it was my first opportunity to 
sort of stand up in front of a class 
and teach material and I found it to 
be exhilarating. I found that this is 
a value my family has had for a long 
time, and no matter how much I 
ignored it, I had it too.”

LSA sophomore Ellie Benson, 

marketing chair for the Golden 
Apple Award selection committee, 
said the group chooses a winner 
based 
on 
both 
quality 
and 

quantity of nominations. This 
year, Levitsky’s nominations were 
clear stand-outs, and Benson said 
students’ enthusiasm for Levitsky 
came across as clearly as Levitsky’s 
enthusiasm for her students and her 
subject.

“A lot of times we see stuff about 

how passionate people are about 
these professors and how this is 
much more than a class to them,” 
she said. “But one of the things 
I thought was really interesting 
(about Levitsky’s nominations) was 

how they thought her lectures were 
like a TED talk and how fun they 
were, and how she’s really good at 
connecting class topics to things 
that are going on right now.”

Though the award is student-

selected, Levitsky’s colleagues also 
hold her in high regard. Sociology 
Department Chair Karin Martin, 
a sociology professor, said in a 
University press release Levitsky 
has worked hard to make her 
classes as inclusive as possible 
for 
students, 
especially 
those 

who are first-generation college 
 

students.

“She’s 
a 
really 
passionate 

teacher,” Martin said. “She has a lot 
of respect for students and thinks 
students deserve the best education 
that this university can give them. 
And I think she really cares about 
students as people — individuals 
with goals and aspirations of their 
own as well as whatever it is she 
wants to teach them.” 

Indeed, LSA junior Kia Schwert, 

a first-generation college student, 
sees Levitsky as a major source of 
inspiration.

“I just want to say having 

you as a professor at my first 
 

semester here at the University as 
a first-generation college student, 
 

and you making yourself apparent 
that you can be a resource here and 
help make a place like this accessible 
to me has inspired me and keeps me 
going,” Schwert told Levitsky at the 
initial award presentation.

The award is presented through 

the University’s Hillel, and was 
inspired by teacher Rabbi Eliezer 
ben Hurkanos, who taught that 
everyone should “get your life 
in order one day before you 
die.” In the spirit of Rabbi ben 
 

Hyrkanos, 
each 
winner 
of 

the 
Golden 
Apple 
gets 
the 
 

opportunity to give their Last 
Lecture — the lecture they would 
want to give if it were the last of 

their career.

Levitsky hasn’t yet decided on a 

theme for her talk. She joked that 
she’s been glad in the past to not 
win the award because of the stress 
coming up with the perfect Last 
Lecture would entail.

“When I first heard about 

this award when I came to the 
University as a postdoc 10 years ago 
and I heard about the last lecture 
part, I thought ‘Oh thank god I’ll 
never win that award, that seems 
impossible!’ and now the universe 
has come around to haunt me!’” 
Levitsky said. “So I don’t know what 
(my topic) will be … But usually, the 
process of inspiration is a solitary 
one so I’m sure it’ll come.”

Nonetheless, Levitsky said she 

feels incredibly honored to have 
won the award, and is excited 
for inspiration to strike. Her Last 
Lecture and official Golden Apple 
Award ceremony will be open to all 
on April 7 at Rackham Auditorium.

Resource Management Plan.

Amid discussions of higher 

water rates, Tom Crawford, chief 
financial officer of Ann Arbor, 
discussed capital financing.

Crawford explained the capital 

financing policy as “(a) sinking 
fund based on prioritization of 

need.”

Financial Services explained 

that a new capital financing policy 
would allow the expenditure to 
follow a steady rate rather than 
causing the budget to go through 
harsh 
spikes 
in 
expenditure 

through wear and tear.

Councilmember Jane Lumm, 

I-Ward 
2, 
expressed 
concern 

regarding the capital financing 
policy.

“Conceptually this makes sense, 

but its obviously expensive up 
front to prefund all of this,” Lumm 
said. “Where will this money 
come from?”

During the budget proposal, 

Financial Services also discussed 
increasing expenditure for street 
lighting. Following the capital 
financing policy, they proposed 
increasing 
the 
street 
lighting 

budget by $295,000 to $595,000. 
 

With this new budget, City 
Council could install about 30 new 
streetlights a year.

Financial Services also proposed 

using proceeds from the mental 
health millage for pedestrian 
safety — including street lighting 
and electronic speed limit signs 
near schools — as well as climate 
action and affordable housing.

While the budget addressed 

issues with city hall security, street 

lighting, and police transparency, 
Crawford also addressed future 
issues for the city such as medical 
marijuana, 
increasing 
parking 

meter enforcement hours, the 
Solid Waste Fund, as well as the 
financial needs of a community 
policing board.

During the special session, 

which followed the budget meeting, 
City Council passed an improved 
contract of compensation for City 

Administrator Howard Lazarus, 
following a positive performance 
review. The council agreed to a 4 
percent raise to Lazarus’ current 
salary of $215,000 to an annual 
salary of $223,600, effective Jan. 
1, 2018.

Rewriting history

MAGDALENA MIHAYLOVA | COLUMN

BEN CHARLSON | COLUMN

N

ow approaching nearly 80 
years since the Holocaust, 
this time period remains 

a sensitive and poignant topic for 
millions of Jews, Slavs and other 
marginalized groups who were 
subject to the repressive, violent racial 
ideology of the Nazis.

As Holocaust remembrance and 

education have come to the forefront 
of conversation about genocide 
prevention, so too has historiography 
and discussion on how the writing 
and telling of Holocaust histories 
has shaped perceptions about a 
genocide that may have taken over 
20 million lives.

On Feb. 1, the conversation over 

Holocaust historiography was once 
again sparked after the Polish Senate 
passed a new bill prohibiting any 
citizens from blaming the country for 
any crimes they committed during 
the Holocaust.

This bill came as a shock to 

countries like the United States and 
Israel, two strong allies of Poland, 
and whose relations to the country 
may be weakened as a result of this 
controversial legislation. However, 
more important than the geopolitical 
implications of this bill, is the basis 
on which the law rests — the idea 
that history can be manipulated 
and rewritten for political purposes, 
even in the presence of explicit 
factual evidence. In the era of “fake 
news,” this bill sets a dangerous new 
precedent in the realm of Holocaust 
denial and should be condemned 
by the United States, among other 
world powers, before its toxic 
ideology can spread.

Holocaust 
denial 
has 
been 

present since the end of World 
War II and the beginning of the 
liberation of concentration camps 
by the Allies. The earliest instance of 
Holocaust denial took place by the 
Nazi perpetrators themselves, who 
destroyed murder evidence at the 
extermination camps of Belzec and 
Treblinka during the early 1940s in 
an attempt to rewrite history before 
the ink had even dried.

Later, 
various 
theories 
of 

Holocaust denial spread throughout 

the United States beginning in the 
1950s and continuing through the 
21st century, largely centered on the 
idea that six million Jews were not 
killed in the Holocaust, but rather that 
they emigrated to the United States in 
a Zionist conspiracy to incriminate 
the Nazis and Axis powers during 
World War II.

Unsurprisingly, these theories 

have been proven time and again 
to be false. Publicly taking a stand 
against this distortion of history, 
many countries have criminalized 
denial of the Holocaust, the first 
being Germany in 1985. This sparked 
an increase in Holocaust denial 
legislation — Israel criminalized 
Holocaust denial in 1986, the Czech 
Republic in 2001, Slovakia in 2001 and 
Romania in 2002, all culminating in 
a United Nations condemnation of 
Holocaust denial in 2007.

However, the effects of this toxic 

ideology still remain. To say Poland 
was not complicit in any acts of the 
Holocaust would be an outright lie 
— Polish police forces and individual 
Poles were indeed accomplices in the 
ghettoization and deportation of Jews 
to Nazi death camps throughout the 
duration of the Holocaust.

Now, the use of the phrase 

“Polish Death Camps” can result in 
three years in prison — the minimum 
sentence given to those “acting with 
an intent to destroy in full or in part, 
any ethnic, racial, political or religious 
group,” or in other words, someone 
attempting to commit the very 
genocide that the Polish government 
is trying to cover up.

Falsifying 
information 

through something as powerful as 
government legislation presents a 
danger to Holocaust education and 
the future of genocide prevention 
across the world. As a history major, 
I have learned that what may be 
considered “the truth” is often 
subjective. For every event, there will 
always be two sides of the story, and 
often the use of language and tone is 
enough to distinguish between two 
perspectives.

For example, the ongoing Israeli-

Palestinian conflict illustrates the 

controversial nature of “truth” from 
a historical perspective. In a debate 
that has become relevant to our own 
campus through the Central Student 
Government vote over divestment in 
Israel, both the Israeli and Palestinian 
sides see the other party as the 
aggressor in the two countries’ violent 
history. In this sense, both sides may 
be “true” depending on perspective.

But some facts are not up for 

interpretation.

The Holocaust is a historical 

truth (quotations omitted), and it 
should be regarded accordingly by 
all countries, especially in the public 
image. Though the United States 
has failed to pass its own legislation 
regarding the criminalization of 
Holocaust denial, likely due to the 
vocal contingent of First Amendment 
supporters across the country, this 
is an opportunity for the Trump 
administration to take a stand.

After a recent meeting with 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu regarding the creation 
of a new U.S Embassy in Jerusalem, 
President Trump announced, “Israel 
is very special to me.” For a president 
who has received nothing but 
criticism and backlash for his own 
distortion of facts, this would be an 
ideal opportunity to speak on the 
dangers of rewriting history while at 
the same time support his ally, Israel.

But the war against Holocaust 

denial 
cannot 
only 
be 
waged 

from above. It starts in places like 
elementary schools and continues 
through high school and college. 
While historians guide the discussion, 
students are the malleable generation 
whose ideology can still be molded by 
factual education.

Ultimately, a collective effort 

emphasizing 
the 
crucial 
role 

of 
historiography 
in 
Holocaust 

education 
will 
be 
integral 
in 

preventing the spread of these toxic 
ideas into our own politics and 
society, in turn protecting future 
generations from becoming victims 
of another genocide.

O

n Feb. 14, 2018, 17 students 
at 
Marjory 
Stoneman 

Douglas 
High 
School 

in Parkland, Fla. were killed by 
former student Nikolas Cruz. In 
the deadliest school shooting since 
Sandy Hook in 2012, the traumatic 
events at Stoneman Douglas High 
School marked another attempted 
mass murder at a school since 
Columbine, Colo. in 1999. There are 
not enough words to describe this 
tragedy that has once again struck 
our nation.

There is a complex web of issues 

that surround what happened at 
Stoneman Douglas — specifically, 
how the gunman was able to 
commit a mass murder. It is true 
that the issue is about gun control. 
However, this is not what I wish 
to discuss today. Rather, I wish to 
discuss a troubling development that 
I have witnessed in the aftermath of 
the shooting: the labeling of Cruz 
as a mentally disturbed “sicko.” 
This labeling has been done by 
President Donald Trump, his circle 
of politicians and the media. What 
everyone fails to realize is how 
their language surrounding Cruz 
(and other people with mental 
illness) has already created and will 
continue to perpetuate, dangerously 
inaccurate stigmatizations about 
mental 
health 
that 
will 
only 

further marginalize and provide a 
reason for discrimination against 
people 
with 
mental 
illnesses. 

This is not an excuse for Cruz or a 
justification for his actions. Rather, 
I am worried that the language 
surrounding his possible mental 
illness reflects broader implications 
about the problems our society has 
with misunderstanding and thus 
stigmatizing mental illness.

The 
Stoneman 
Douglas 

shooting is the most recent example, 
but it is important to acknowledge 
that stigmatizing language has been 
used to label shooters historically. 
For example, last October, after 
a gunman in Las Vegas killed 58 
people, Trump called the assailant 
“a very sick man” and a “demented 
man.” Sandy Hook shooter Adam 
Lanza, who killed 27 people in 
2012, was labeled by his father as 
“evil.” And James Holmes, who 
killed 12 people at an Aurora, Colo. 
movie theater six years ago has 
been labeled as “broken,” “sick” and 
described to have had a “skewed” 
view of the world.

Yes, 
Cruz’s 
actions 
were 

dangerous and the loss of 17 bright 
lives is absolutely, devastatingly 
heartbreaking, and it is true that 
he may have had mental health 

problems. According to reports, 
Cruz struggled with depression, 
attention-deficit 
hyperactivity 

disorder and autism, but many 
experts say that having a mental 
health diagnosis does not mean 
he would become violent. That is 
the key point here: Just because 
someone has a mental illness does 
not mean they are going to become 
a school shooter, it does not mean 
they are a “sicko” and it does not 
mean they are going to be a danger 
to society. The language being used 
to describe Cruz, and shooters in 
general, is now going to be attached 
to the greater population of people 
with mental illnesses.

When it comes to mental 

health, language matters. Instead of 
labeling people with mental illness 
as “sickos” and “monsters,” we need 
to understand the bigger picture. 
People are not born monsters, and 
having a mental illness does not 
mean you are a monster.

In 
order 
to 
clarify 
some 

information about the relationship 
between mental health and violent 
crimes, we should answer the 
question: Are people with mental 
illness more prone to committing 
violent crimes? Contrary to the 
claims 
of 
politicians, 
research 

suggests that no, this is not the 
case. It is estimated that one in six 
Americans has a mental illness. Yet, 
only 3 to 5 percent of violent acts 
are carried out by the mentally ill. 
In fact, people with mental illness 
are more likely to be victims — not 
perpetrators — of violence. Based 
on this information, the correlation 
between mental illness and violent 
crimes doesn’t really hold up.

To understand why stigmatizing 

language 
toward 
people 
with 

mental illness is so prevalent today, 
we need to understand where these 
stigmas originate. The truth is 
that stigmatizing language toward 
people with mental illnesses is so 
prominent in our culture that we 
may not even realize it. A team of 
researchers found that 46 percent 
of 
cartoons 
in 
New 
Zealand 

referenced 
mental 
illness 
and 

vocabulary toward those suffering 
from mental illness was found to 
be “predominantly negative or 
fundamentally disrespectful.” So 
even though there is no evidence 
justifying the stigma that people 
with mental illness are more likely 
to commit a violent crime, we are 
influenced from a young age to 
believe the opposite.

What we learn as children 

affects how we act as adults. In this 
case, stigmas around mental illness 

can limit employment opportunities. 
According to a 2017 British study, 68 
percent of people able to hire staff 
would worry that someone with a 
severe mental illness wouldn’t fit 
in with the team, 83 percent would 
worry that someone with severe 
mental illness wouldn’t be able to 
cope with the demands of the job 
and 74 percent would worry that 
someone with severe mental illness 
would require lots of time off. These 
concerns may be part of the reason 
just 43 percent of people with mental 
health problems are in employed in 
comparison to 74 percent of the 
general population.

So, words matter. In the case of 

mental illness, they create barriers 
between the “sane” individuals and 
those who are disparaged by this 
stigmatizing language. For many, 
it may seem harmless to use these 
kinds of words, but they become 
the foundation of a kind of stigma 
that blocks treatment, prevents 
employment and wreaks havoc on 
the self-esteem and hopes of so many.

In order to stop the harmful 

effects of stigmatization, we need 
to be asking the questions: Who 
gets to define sanity? And how do 
we justify the stigmatization of 
mental health when we know that 
the numbers don’t even add up — 
that people with mental illnesses 
are no more likely to commit a 
violent crime than the “rational” 
individual? What is the reasoning 
behind the name-calling, labeling 
and marginalization of people with 
mental illnesses? And furthermore, 
what are the consequences of the 
discourse around mental health? 
How is our society being shaped by 
our language?

The current rhetoric around 

people with mental illness is very 
dangerous. It’s more than just 
characters in tweets or words 
uttered into a microphone. These 
words are absorbed into our brains 
and are the foundation of how we 
construct society. If we constantly 
hear about how “deranged” Cruz 
was, then his actions will be written 
off as something us sane individuals 
will never be able to understand. 
But if we can never understand him, 
then how do we prevent this from 
happening again? How can we ever 
understand mentally ill people if we 
continue to label them as monsters 
and isolate them from society? 
People are not born monsters; they 
are created. We have created a 
monster out of mental illness.

Our language creates a monster out of mental illness

T

he first song that made 
me feel like a woman was 
“Can’t Hold Us Down” by 

singers Christina Aguilera and Lil’ 
Kim. I was about 12 years old, and 
despite how young I was, the lyrics 
struck my heart so deeply that 
I remember almost every detail 
about that day. From the first line, 
“So, what am I not supposed to 
have an opinion? / Should I be 
quiet just because I’m a woman,” 
I 
felt 
something 
brewing, 

bubbling and rising in the pit of 
my stomach — empowerment.

In the era of President Donald 

Trump, it is difficult to escape 
politics. It fills news cycles and 
conversations, and only if one is 
privileged can they ignore the 
dynamic changes in our country; 
“ignorance is bliss” has taken on 
a new meaning. Many people turn 
to art as a method of escape from 
political noise, but I argue that it 
is actually through books, movies 
and music that the most effective 
and important political statements 
can be made. When my parents 
sat me down at 12 years old and 
told me that I should always 
speak my mind regardless of my 
gender, I was probably too busy 
playing with my animal crackers 
to really internalize that message, 
however important it was. But 
when I heard Deborah Cox’s song 
“Absolutely Not,” with lyrics like 
“If I go to work in a mini-skirt, / 
Am I givin’ you the right to flirt? 
/ I won’t compromise my point of 
view / Absolutely not, absolutely 
not,” those sentiments became 
embedded in the hidden corners 
of my mind and influenced how I 
feel and act today.

This may seem like a silly, 

redundant anecdote, but I believe 
that subtle social influences have 
great authority in our world. A 
recent New York Times article 
commented 
on 
how, 
despite 

Republican control of government, 
from the presidency to the Senate 
to the House of Representatives, 
Democrats 
and 
progressives 

have massive cultural control in 
our country. Movements such as 
#MeToo or the diversification 
of media display the entwined 
relationship between policy and 
prose. The idea that liberals are 
gaining traction and influence 
through 
cultural 
mediums 

makes me hopeful for change. 
Art and politics have a crucial, 
interdependent relationship, and 
one that if utilized, can have a 
great effect.

And it has in the past. During 

the era of communism, Eastern 
Europeans found in rock and roll 
music a channel for dissidence. 
Rock bands were the image of 
sneaky rebellion, in that they 
were able to express political 
opinions in a way that (mostly) 
didn’t get them in trouble with the 
government. Their music enticed 
and inspired thought, and was the 
foundation for many anti-state 
movements. For those trapped 
under a totalitarian regime that 
stressed monotony, the passion of 
music and symbolic lyrics served 
as a compelling motivator for 
revolution. Eventually, the power 
of these bands demonstrated how 
social expression could lead to 
real political change, as many 
scholars argue that rock music 
played a major role in the collapse 
of the Eastern Bloc.

In the United States, a similar 

phenomenon to what happened 
in Eastern Europe exists, and has 
recently been manifesting itself in 
film. With new, successful movies 
such as “Get Out,” our nation 
is being exposed to important 
political statements in a manner 
that isn’t aggressive, but subtly 
influential. Artists are now able 
to gain success despite creating 

works centered on controversies, 
or that include diverse casting 
and themes. For example, “Get 
Out” appears as a simple horror 
film; however, underneath the 
classic horror plot, there is an 
abundance of meaning, and the 
movie is ultimately and undeniably 
about racism. Because horror is 
such an accessible and well-liked 
genre, director Jordan Peele was 
able to communicate a message 
to people who wouldn’t typically 
attend a movie about racism. And it 
wasn’t a flop: “Get Out” generated 
$255 million in box office profits 
worldwide and won the Academy 
Award for Best Original Screenplay. 
This shows that art can be both 
political and successful.

George Orwell, an author 

known 
for 
his 
politically-

messaged 
works 
such 
as 

“Animal 
Farm” 
and 
“1984,” 

once said, “The opinion that 
art should have nothing to do 
with politics is itself a political 
attitude.” It would be easy for 
us to only use art as a means of 
entertainment and escape from 
the overwhelming political state 
of our country. However, it would 
be more responsible to continue 
to create, or at least support the 
creators, of tendentious art. And 
although the effects aren’t always 
on a large scale, such as in my 
12-year-old experience, it doesn’t 
mean they aren’t important. If 
we utilize cultural power, we 
can and will generate social 
change; 
inevitably, 
tangible 

political power will follow. To 
me, it is obvious that something 
as beautiful and connective as 
art will eventually take the reins 
in building a more inclusive, 
functional and cohesive nation.

LUCAS ROSENDALL | OP-ED

O

ver Spring Break, I stopped 
by my local movie theater 
to watch the highly praised, 

“Black Panther.” The film had a 
different feel than other Marvel 
movies, straying away from the cliché 
evil villain who is evil strictly because 
they enjoy it. Instead, the film opts 
for a more sympathetic villain who 
many can relate to. It’s a refreshing 
take from the industry that usually 
produces strikingly similar heroes, 
villains and plot lines.

After the movie, I felt empowered. 

I felt this array of confidence and 
swagger come over me and for a 
second, I was the Black Panther. I 
felt like a superhero. This movie is an 
example of how film, music and the 
arts can transcend the boundaries of 
inequality and reach a vast array of 
people, no matter the color of their 
skin, class and gender. As I walked 
out of the theater, visualizing myself 
in the slick and savvy Black Panther 
suit, I began to wonder: Is America 
approaching equality?

The media has the ability to 

shape our social ideologies and 
discourses. Today, we are constantly 
“plugged in,” especially in the realm 
of the instant gratification we gain 
through streaming services. In the 
1960s, times were not so simple. 
The civil rights movement swept 
over the nation, stirring disputes as 
racial tensions grew. Then, in 1968, 
boxer Muhammad Ali stepped onto 
the cover of Esquire. Ali posed with 

arrows stuck in his body from 
all angles, blood (probably fake) 
gushing from the wounds; yet he 
stood tall, head turned upwards 
as if calling for the heavens for 
help. This cover would become 
one of the defining pictures of 
the decade; a powerful black 
figure with non-conforming ideas 
inspiring mainstream society to 
think differently. Covers like this 
serve as the foundation for a new 
kind of thinking because they 
challenge the status quo, and this 
challenge eventually alters the 
way we view race.

Fast forward to 2017, and pregnant 

tennis player Serena Williams poses on 
the cover of Vanity Fair while flaunting 
her powerful, athletic body. A cover like 
this is years and years in the making, 
having gone through the media’s 
constant shaping of our perceptions of 
what is socially acceptable. There were 
times in America when a cover like 
this seemed unimaginable. Yet, here 
we are. Throughout the years, race 
and gender have changed, and with 
it, equality has changed too. African 
Americans are seen in more significant 
roles throughout the entertainment 
industry than before. Many important 
conversations have been brought to 
light, including the conversations 
inspired by movements like #MeToo 
and Black Lives Matter. We must take 
the small victories where we can, 
hoping they will add up to the bigger 
picture as we strive for equality.

Today, the useless information 

that floods our media sources dilutes 
the more serious issues at hand in our 
society. Media outlets and different 
social media platforms still idolize 
white entertainers and celebrities, 
hardly ever challenging societal 
norms. They preach the importance 
of physical beauty and happiness, 
which reinforces and shapes our 
socially-constructed ideal that in 
order to have both, one must look like 
a celebrity. 

It may be far-fetched to say that 

we can ever fully accomplish equality. 
Oppression, unequal rights and class 
hierarchies still plague our society, but 
we are moving in the right direction.

I personally do not believe 

full equality can ever be reached; 
conventional 
norms 
are 
still 

embedded in our culture and will 
be for a long time. Nonetheless, the 
media has come a long way, and it is 
important to note the strides we have 
made in becoming a more inclusive 
society. We must continue to push 
the boundaries of what is socially 
acceptable like Ali did, like Williams 
is doing and like “Black Panther” will 
do. Only then will we shape our future 
for the better. In “Black Panther”, 
the main character, T’Challa puts it 
beautifully: “We must find a way to 
look after one another, as if we were 
one single tribe.”

Is America approaching equality?

An attempt was made. If 
nothing else — and there is 
ultimately little else — director 
Ava DuVernay (“Selma”) tried 
to use “A Wrinkle in Time” to 
craft an ambitious vehicle for 
a diverse cast and a message 
about loving yourself with all 
your flaws and rough edges. It’s 
just deeply unfortunate that 
the message and the cast are 
saddled with one of the worst 
scripts Disney has worked 
with in recent memory. The 

film is crammed to bursting 
with gaping plot holes and so 
many 
bewildering 
creative 
decisions that it almost feels 
directionless. It’s undoubtedly 
well-meaning, but that can’t 
save it. “A Wrinkle in Time” is 
an unmitigated disaster.
From the first scenes, the 
portrayal of child characters 
is clearly the work of adults 
who rarely speak to kids. 
Not only do the dialogue and 
performances make the whole 
ordeal feel akin to children’s 
theater, but the adolescents 
at the center of the story 
spend most of the movie being 
shuffled 
around 
without 
making any decisions of their 
own. If you want to give young 
people positive role models on 
film, those characters must be 
active enough to be interesting 
and worth looking up to. Even 
if the script wasn’t so flat in its 
approach, it would still have to 
contend with the soundtrack, 
which blankets any and every 
emotional scene with a cloying, 

generic pop song that uses 
buzzwords like “warrior” to 
make half-hearted connections 
to the movie. Once would 
be annoying, but it happens 
multiple 
times, 
and 
every 
time a potentially beautiful or 
inventive scene is robbed of its 
impact.
Even 
when 
they 
aren’t 
being moved about like game 
pieces, the characters verge 
on annoying and never get 
any real development. Charles 
Wallace 
(Deric 
McCabe, 
“Stephanie”) is meant to be a 
child prodigy, but instead of 
precocious and intelligent, he 
comes off as more inhuman, 
like if young Sheldon Cooper 
went 
on 
an 
adventure 
to 
Narnia. In one memorable 
scene, it’s mentioned in a 
line of dialogue that he was 
teleported ahead, and my only 
guess is that McCabe wasn’t 
available on the days they 
were shooting those scenes. 
There’s 
also 
a 
character 
named Calvin (Levi Miller, 
“Pan”), who literally shows 
up without an introduction in 
one scene and does nothing 
for the rest of the movie 
besides add what I’m assuming 
would have been a romantic 
subplot if writer Jennifer Lee 
(“Frozen”) had remembered 
to give him and Meg Murray 
(“Sleight”) any chemistry. He 
and Charles Wallace are two 
of the main leads, and neither 
adds anything positive to the 
proceedings.
No one else, other than 
maybe 
Zach 
Galifianakis 
(“Baskets”), 
acquits 
themselves particularly well, 
but it’s impossible to blame 
the actors when the writing 
fails so completely at character 
development. Mindy Kaling 
(“The Mindy Project”) get the 
worst of this. The ordinarily 
gifted 
performer 
is 
given 
nothing to do but react to 
whatever 
new 
whimsy 
is 
trying to pass for a plot. Even 
the visuals, while occasionally 
inspired 
in 
concept, 
are 
completely flat in practice; in 
one scene Meg travels through 

what seems to be a Windows 
screensaver 
of 
some 
sort, 
and almost all of the exciting 
locales teased in the trailers 
are covered in a single awful 
montage set to — you guessed 
it — a trite pop song. What 
could have been a ravishing 
universe of new worlds to 
explore amounts to little more 
than visual noise.

By 
the 
time 
Reese 
Witherspoon has turned into 
what appears to be a flying 
piece of lettuce and flown 
close enough to a gigantic 
projection of Oprah for a young 
child to lovingly stroke her 
face, it had hit me: “A Wrinkle 
in Time” isn’t a movie. It’s an 
advertisement 
for 
Disney’s 
next theme park. It’s directed, 
written and edited like a 
promo for a rollercoaster, but 
instead of 30 seconds, it goes 
on for almost two hours. Even 
the effects, for a $100 million 
film, look like they belong in a 
TV commercial break. There’s 
no sense of purpose to the 
pacing or development or tone 
or any of it. It’s hard to say, but 
it’s true: “A Wrinkle in Time” 
never lives up to its good 
intentions.

‘Wrinkle in Time’ is well-
meaning, poorly written

Time”

Studios

State Theater

My dad recently sent me a 
video from my 15th birthday 
party. In the video, I blew out 
the candles in one shot and 
the kitchen lights turned on to 
show my bright eyes — which 
were too big for my petite face 
— and my long, blonde hair, 
which is much different than 
the shorter brown hair I have 
now. My two high school best 
friends look like infants as they 
sing “Happy Birthday” beside 
me. In a thick Philly accent, 
my older sister criticizes me 
for sticking my finger in the 

cake and licking the icing. 
Under the video, my dad sent 
a follow up text: “Time flies!! 
Enjoy life!!”
My dad’s not wrong. It’s 
cliché, but life does seem to 
fly by us without warning. It’s 
also a challenge to remember 
every pinnacle moment of joy 
that 
we’ve 
experienced 
or 
every person that’s helped us 
get to where we are now. If he 
hadn’t sent that video to me, 
that memory would probably 
be erased from my mind.
It’s strange to see ourselves 
at various milestones, like 
when you look at baby photos 
and question how you could 
be that small, or you look at 
yourself 
in 
middle 
school 

and try to understand your 
awkwardness. I think back to 
that person in my video — a 
youthful and pretty 15-year-
old with an athletic build, one 
who just barely understands 
her rise into womanhood. I was 
a woman who wasn’t conscious 
of who she was or how to take 
care of herself.
Among age, we see the idea 
of health in various mediums 
both physically and mentally. 
As younger people, we feel 
invincible 
with 
our 
fresh, 
agile bodies, but as we become 
older, it seems that we pay 
more attention to our physical 
health because of our bodies 
aging and being more prone 
to injury or illness. Mentally, 
we seem to be more cognizant 
of our mental health as young 
students, but the urgency to 
take care of our mentality 
seems to dissipate as we age. 
I can’t help but to wonder why 
health transforms into this 
funky, indirect proportion as 
we grow older.
It’s only been six years 
(psh, only six years) since that 
video was taken, and while 
I looked and acted healthy, I 
seemingly didn’t care about 
any of it. Most 15-year-olds 
don’t. When you’re young, you 
only worry about falling in 
love and meeting friends and 
experiencing every bit that 
life has to offer (and surviving 
high school, of course). Time 
goes on, however, and stress 
becomes more relevant. We 
take more time to ponder the 
world and our place in it; with 
that, our conscious effort to 
take care of our health becomes 
another priority lowered down 
on the list. And to be frank, I 
just don’t get why.
We’re always told to enjoy 
our youth while we have it and 

take care of ourselves before 
it’s “too late.” Time does fly, 
but why do we have to despise 
the latter half of life? I’m 
worlds away from that girl 
in the video, and as much as 
I loved being that age, I love 
where I’m at now so much 
more. I know my body and how 
it works. I know how far my 
stress can build until I break 
down. I know more of what 

I want from myself and out 
of life. Sure, I’m still a semi-
directionless 
21-year-old, 
but I’m more conscious of my 
health, and I care more about 
myself.
I 
want 
to 
break 
this 
systematic idea that getting 
older sucks. We should live life 
for its presence, where we can 
be conscious of this difficult 
journey of soul-searching and 
taking care of ourselves. If we 
indefinitely love who we are, if 
we remember to not be so hard 
on ourselves and if we never 
take our health for granted, it 
doesn’t ever have to be too late.

It’s just deeply 
unfortunate that 
the message 
and the cast are 
saddled with 
one of the worst 
scripts Disney has 
worked with in 
recent memory

FX

“Robbin’ 
Season,” 
as 
“Atlanta”’s 
resident 
stoner/
philosopher 
Darius 
(Lakeith 
Stanfield, “Get Out”) explains, 
is the period of time before the 
Christmas holidays. It is one 
of 
rampant 
commercialism 
and, apparently, one of equally 
rampant thievery.

This 
type 
of 
explicit 
exposition is a rarity in Donald 
Glover’s “Atlanta.” The show 
prefers to make its commentary 
in 
a 
more 
impressionistic 
manner, presenting a series 
of vignettes that reflect the 
mundane absurdities of daily life 
in the titular city where Glover 
was raised. The show’s episodes, 
ranging from just 25-30 minutes 
each, have an uncanny ability 
to draw viewers into the world 
they create before ending just as 
quickly.
The 
harrowing 
opening 
scene of the season shows two 
teenagers executing the robbery 
of a fast food restaurant, as well as 
how an unexpected development 
sends the operation awry. It sets 
the tone of what Glover describes 
as the “nightmare” of season two 
as opposed to the “dream” of 
season one. There is a palpable 
tension present in the Atlanta air.
The show’s main characters 
haven’t 
progressed 
much 
from the conclusion of season 
one. 
Earn 
(Donald 
Glover, 
“Spider Man: Homecoming”) 
is kicked out of his “home” in 

a storage facility. His cousin, 
Paper Boi (Bryan Henry, “Vice 
Principals”), 
remains 
under 
house arrest, which does grant 
him some notoriety, helping 
his popularity. There is an 
unresolved 
conflict 
between 
Paper Boi and Darius, which is 
never explained. Episode one 
features a memorable cameo 
from Katt Williams as well as 
a prime reptilian example of 
the show’s ability to turn from 
hyperrealism to surrealism in 
the space of a single cut.
Despite 
the 
continuing 
bleakness, the show derives 
humor in the small absurdities 
that litter the characters’ lives 
and reinforces the central idea 
of being robbed. At the start of 
episode two (“Sporting Waves”), 
Paper Boi is held at gunpoint 
during 
a 
rendezvous 
with 
his long-time dealer (Marcus 
Samuel, “Murder Choose Me”). 
As he walks away sporting his 
signature scowl after giving up 
his money and car keys, his dealer 
repeatedly offers his sincere 
apologies while continuing to 
point a gun at him. The framing 
of the rather courteous robbery 
suggests that it is not borne out 
of an inherent penchant for 
crime, but rather an unexplained 
necessity. “I’ll pay you back,” the 
dealer promises at the end. 
A visit to a music technology 
startup 
offers 
a 
different 
perspective 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
being 
robbed. 
Set 
in 
an 
overwhelmingly 
racially 
homogenous environment, Earn 
and Paper Boi’s interactions 
with the company’s staff are 
increasingly 
uncomfortable 
to watch. Paper Boi grows 
increasingly exasperated as he is 
forced to repeat inane variations 
of a radio show introduction, 
finally 
storming 
off 
after 
“performing” in front of a crowd 
who clearly have no interest in 
him or his music.
In the same episode, Earn 
and Paper Boi meet another 

young rapper, Clark County 
(R.J. Walker, “Hand of God”), 
who embraces his role for 
the 
company, 
performing 
enthusiastically 
for 
a 
room 
of employees (referencing a 
profoundly uncomfortable video 
featuring rapper Bobby Shmurda 

dancing at Epic Records). His 
appearance later in the episode in 
a cheesy commercial recalls one 
of Paper Boi’s principal conflicts, 
one between commercial success 
and authenticity.
The 
genius 
of 
“Atlanta” 
lies in its astute observation 
of the sheer weirdness of the 
characters’ seemingly ordinary 
daily lives. On the surface, the 
characters don’t do much and live 
thoroughly unglamorous lives. 
Dialogue is minimal, a lot of time 
is spent lounging on couches 
and prospects for the main 
characters are overwhelmingly 
bleak. Yet the depiction of how 
the characters move and interact 
through their environment as 
well as the detrimental effects 
of poverty provides plenty of 
material to reflect upon after you 
finish laughing.

‘Atlanta: Robbin’ Season’ is 
weird & poignant as ever

BOOK NOTEBOOK

I wanted this article to 
be about the power of books 
to heal. I wanted to talk 
decisively about how novels, 
poems and essays can direct 
collective and personal anger, 
supply comfort and provide 
an 
instructive 
array 
of 
resonant experiences. In the 
past three weeks, though, the 
usually profound and reliable 
competence of words has felt 
radically insufficient.
I’ve always relied on other 
people’s writing to navigate 
my own emotions, and so of 
course I’ve looked to books 
to help me understand the 
struggle between hope and 
disillusionment that has been 
sweeping the country since the 
shooting at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School on Feb. 
14th. I have found no books 
that even come close to crafting 
some sort of framework for my 
grief, no poems that contain 
an alchemical recipe to turn 
my despair into power. The 
only thing I know for sure is 
this: Young people should not 
be dying in their classrooms 
because politicians refuse to 
pass sensible gun control laws. 
Last week, I reread “Love in 
a Time of Cholera” by Gabriel 
García Márquez.
“She was lost in her longing 
to 
understand,” 
Marquez 
writes. I think I, too, am lost in 
my longing to understand.
Like 
so 
many 
students 
I know, I am scared. The 
Parkland shooting seems like 
it was both yesterday and a 
lifetime ago. There is a constant 
barrage of new details about 
the events of that day and the 
days that followed, horrifying 
aftershocks 
whose 
impacts 
are lessened not because some 
suffering is any less worthy 
of empathy, but because my 
ability to process my own and 
others’ grief is diminished 
from 
constant 
emotional 
exertion.
I read a story last week about 
a woman whose son survived 

the Parkland massacre and 
whose 
daughter 
survived 
the 2006 Platte Canyon High 
School shooting. That such 
tragedy — and also luck, if it can 
even be called that — should 
strike twice in the same family 
is unimaginable. I want a book 
that will tell me what to do 
with the anger and frustration 
I have from reading stories like 
the Randolph family’s. What 
does it mean when even the 
insights of my favorite authors 

feel insufficient?
There are not any books that 
could possibly tell me exactly 
how 
to 
tackle 
everything 
that 
needs 
to 
change 
in 
America, nor even any about 
how to address the specific 
yet incredibly intersectional 
injustice of gun violence. I 
was looking for comprehensive 
guides; I will never find that. 
Instead, I think the best I can 
hope for is clarity through 
description, reflections not of 
my grief but rather of my quest 
to understand why I can’t find 
what I need. “I need a book 
about how I’m supposed to live 
now,” writes Paulo Bacigalupi 
in “The Water Knife.” That’s 
what 
I 
was 
looking 
for: 
A 
roadmap 
of 
uncharted 
territory, a chronicle of this 
bizarre place we have found 
ourselves. Instead I’ll have to 
make it up as I go along, as we 

all do.
What I’ve come understand 
is this: When words are not 
enough, that is exactly when 
we need them most. Even when 
they fall short, they still try — 
and so we try, too. To give up 
on language, to allow sorrow 
to rob poetry of its beauty, or 
even to rely solely on stories 
and forget to act: This would 
be to let evil win. I look to 
Tim O’Brien’s “The Things 
They Carried” for the best 
meditations on the Sisyphean 
task of reckoning with violence.
“You feel wonder and awe at 
the setting of the sun,” O’Brien 
says, “and you are filled with 
a hard, aching love for how 
the world could be and always 
should be, but now is not.”
“The 
oceans 
surge, 
but 
the boat / is up on blocks. / 
There’s no America to sail to / 
anymore.” — Amit Majmudar
“One says slow, the other 
stop. / Joy and sorrow always 
run like parallel lines.” — Didi 
Jackson
“When I was silenced / when 
did it first seem pointless to 
describe that sound.” — Louise 
Glück
“Our brief crossing is best 
spent attending to all that we 
see: honoring what we find 
noble, denouncing what we 
cannot abide, recognizing that 
we are inseparably connected 
to all of it, including what is 
not yet upon us, including what 
is already gone.” — Kathryn 
Schulz
“And a terrible new ache / 
rolled over in my chest, / like in 
a room where the drapes / have 
been swept back.” — Tracy K. 
Smith
We could never fix this 
country 
with 
books 
alone. 
Instead, we must harness that 
aching love for the world as 
we wish it was. We must stand 
witness to the gut-wrenching 
disregard for the well-being 
of those among us who are 
most vulnerable. We must fight 
with the perspicacity bestowed 
upon us by the best writers, 
marching forward into the 
future with a hope that is as 
specific and inexhaustible as 
memory.

At a loss for words: When 
literature fails to console

There are not 

any books that 

could possibly tell 

me exactly how to 

tackle everything 

that needs to 

change in America

“It’s so nice to not be at a bar.”
Midway 
through 
Snail 
Mail’s 
set, 
lead 
singer/
guitarist Lindsey Jordan took 
a moment to appreciate the 
beautiful space of the Museum 
of Contemporary Art Detroit 
(MOCAD), the venue where 
she — alongside Ought and 
Fred Thomas — performed at 
on Mar. 8th. While the space 
did feature a fully stocked bar, 
it was far from a dive — soft 
yellow 
incandescents 
hung 
staggered from the ceiling, wall 
flags displayed messages like 
“A HORROR MOVIE CALLED 
WESTERN 
CIVILIZATION” 
and the stage was backed by 
a glass paneled garage door 
for those passing on the street 
to peer through. The venue 
itself wasn’t huge, but the 
room felt big and spacious, 
enough for groups of people to 
cluster either near the bar or in 
different locations in front of 
the stage.
Regardless 
of 
MOCAD’s 
unique intricacies, Snail Mail, 
who preceded Ought, put on an 
absolutely stellar performance. 
Aged only 18 and already set 
to perform at Coachella this 
year, Jordan and company have 
been turning heads since 2017. 
The band’s brand of indie punk 
is magnetic and bareboned; 

watching Jordan play guitar — 
stunning control and precision 
already 
evident 
at 
such 
a 
young age — is mesmerizing. 
According to her interview with 
Pitchfork from a year ago, she 
has been playing since she was 
five-years-old and one of her 
guitar teachers, Mary Timony 
of the band Helium, said, “The 
first time she played me songs 
she was writing, I was totally 
blown away. There is this real 
timelessness 
and 
maturity 
and depth in her music.” The 
sentiment absolutely translates 
in their live performance.
During and in between songs, 
Jordan cast mischievous smiles 
at her bandmates, fully aware of 
their penchant for captivation 
— from my spot in the crowd, 
everyone was nearly silent for 
Snail Mail’s entire performance 
except for raucous applause. 
They 
surprisingly 
slipped 
their 
hit 
song 
“Thinning” 
into the middle of their set, 
eliciting resonance from the 
crowd that echoed Jordan’s 
tight, honest lyricism. “Dirt” 
lilted over the crowd, swaying 
guitar 
rhythms 
exited 
the 
speakers and enraptured the 
listeners. Jordan’s voice has 
a nuanced depth, creating a 
sense of resignation and self-
understanding in her music.
To Ought’s misfortune, about 
half the crowd left after Snail 
Mail’s set (possibly due to how 
late the show was running on 

a Thursday night). Yet, the 
post-punk group’s music still 
cast a spell over the rest who 
remained. In performance and 
on record, the band comes off 
like a hybrid between DIIV 
and Parquet Courts, wielding 
deep, repetitive basslines and 
dissonant guitar melodies to 
split a chasm in the atmosphere 
of the room, only to have that 
space filled with cavernous and 
staccato vocal deliveries from 
frontman Tim Darcy. On their 
new wave tinged 2018 release 
Room Inside the World, Ought 
sprinkles a little more melody 
and pop into their tried-and-
true songwriting, getting into 
a more digestible groove with 
“These 3 Things.” However, 
they didn’t shy from their roots, 
returning to their 2014 debut 
album More Than Any Other 
Day with the sparsely delivered 
“Habit.”
If there’s anything to take 
away from the show, it’s that 
2018 may be the year of indie 
rock (especially for women). 
Between stellar releases from 
Ought, Camp Cope and Soccer 
Mommy, the year has already 
been off to a fantastic start 
for the genre — hopefully 
even further improved with 
the addition of new music 
from Snail Mail. And if last 
Thursday’s 
show 
is 
any 
indication, Snail Mail may just 
be the year’s biggest breakout 
artist.

CONCERT REVIEW

DOMINIC POLSINELLI / DAILY

If 
you’re 
looking 
for 
a 
riveting, 
suspense-building 
espionage film, “Red Sparrow” 
is not that. If you’re looking 
for a film with 
unnecessary 
ultra 
violence 
and gore with 
a 
disorganized 
plot, then look to 
“Red Sparrow.” 
“Red 
Sparrow” 
probably aimed to be something 
akin to the Bond films, but 
the 
ultimate 
presentation 
was more of a disappointing, 
melodramatic “ugly step-sister” 
to a legitimate spy movie.
When ballerina Dominika 
Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence, 
“Mother!”) suffers a career-
crushing injury, she is forced to 
enlist in her sleazy, sycophantic 
uncle’s (Matthias Schoenaerts, 
“A Bigger Splash”) world of 
Russian intelligence in order 
to financially provide for her 
sick mother. She eventually 
sacrifices her body to the 
state, as she is sent to become 
a Sparrow in “whore school,” 
where 
the 
women 
become 
highly 
trained 
in 
sexual 
coercion 
and 
seduction. 
Dominika passes her training 
and is released to become close 
with a CIA member, Nate Mash 
(Joel 
Edgerton, 
“Bright”), 
but 
her 
situation 
becomes 

complicated upon contact.
Just when things start to 
potentially become a little more 
compelling 
when 
Dominika 
enters her Sparrow training, 
a training that is supposed 
to be taxing on the body and 
the mind, she is released. 
Being a Sparrow is supposed 
to be the most 
highly 
selective 
form of Russian 
intelligence, 
but 
there aren’t enough 
scenes 
to 
prove 
how 
strenuous 
the 
training 
is. 
We don’t believe it. The only 
exposition we have from this 
moment is Lawrence’s nude 
body, 
which, 
coupled 
with 
violence, is used too liberally 
and sloppily throughout the 
film. Violence can be effective 
and 
powerful 
when 
used 
deliberately in cinema, and 
when 
violent 
moments 
are 
intended to evoke suspense and 
drama. When used carefully, 
the result is more grounded and 
causes true fear. When violence 
is 
overused, 
like 
in 
“Red 
Sparrow,” the movie becomes 
about gore and tricks and loses 
any element of reality. It begins 
to devolve into a gimmick. And 
more importantly, it creates a 
truly 
unpleasant 
experience 
for the audience with no real 
redeeming moments. At times, 
it even seemed like the film had 
fully transformed into an SNL 
satire of a spy movie.
Besides the overuse of gore, 

Lawrence’s performance was 
not terrible, but it was not 
praiseworthy. The version of 
Lawrence we saw in “Silver 
Linings Playbook,” a performer 
with nuance and heart, has been 
absent in her recent films. This 
could partly be out of her control 
and attributed to types of roles 
she has been getting. But for 
now, we are wishing for a return 
to the old Lawrence. With “Red 
Sparrow”’s lackluster reception 
and especially “Mother!”’s box 
office flop, hopefully Lawrence’s 
next project will return her 
to a more prized reputation. 
But with her inconsistent and 
embarrassing Russian accent in 
“Red Sparrow” it is difficult to 
predict where the quality of her 
future projects is heading.
Dominika’s 
femme 
fatale 
persona proves to outsmart 
her male counterparts, and 
despite her power deriving 
from sex, she knows how to 
trick and beguile to rise to the 
top. “Red Sparrow” could have 
made a stronger commentary 
on female power, but instead, 
it was too tempted by showing 
silly violence and tricks that 
detracted from the core of 
the story. It also could have 
explored 
the 
detrimental 
effects of blindly following a 
rigid state that has no remorse 
for its citizens, nor did it expose 
the intricate and complicated 
nature 
of 
espionage. 
“Red 
Sparrow” had potential, maybe, 
with a stacked cast like that, but 
it fell short.

‘Red Sparrow’ is a dull stab

Marody’s moment: From student of the game to college hockey superstar

As is tradition for countless 

fathers in Southeast Michigan, 
Patrick Marody often took his son 
Cooper to hockey games when the 
boy was young.

The Marodys are a hockey family, 

and in the mid-2000s, there weren’t 
many better places for a hockey 
family than their hometown of 
Brighton, Mich. Forty-five minutes 
east, Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik 
Zetterberg lit lamps and dazzled 
fans on a nightly basis with the 
NHL’s Detroit Red Wings amid 
their most recent dynasty. Twenty 
minutes south, Red Berenson had 
built the Michigan hockey team into 
a collegiate powerhouse, then in the 
middle of a legendary streak of 22 
straight NCAA Tournament berths.

So it’s no surprise that Cooper 

quickly fell in love with the sport. But 
when Patrick took him to games, he 
noticed something interesting.

“He would just stand,” Patrick 

said. “He wouldn’t want to sit down. 
He would stand, and he would watch 
all the players. He was mesmerized 
in watching them do every move.”

By nature, hockey is chaotic. 

Players slam into each other at 
speeds of 20 miles per hour or 
more. Pucks can fly five times that 
fast. It’s energetic, electrifying and 
exhilarating — and for a newcomer, 
especially a child, it can be nearly 
impossible to comprehend.

And yet, that was all young Cooper 

wanted to do. Instead of embracing 
the mayhem, he dug deeper. He 
was entranced by the sport’s skills, 
structures and subtleties. He would 
watch highlights, go to bed, wake 
up and watch more. He became, in 
his father’s words, a “student of the 
game.”

“He wasn’t just watching the 

excitement of the game, he was 
watching the strategy and how the 
players go and how they perform 
with the puck and things of that 
nature,” Patrick said. “… Some people 
go to an event where they just watch 
the chaos in the event. … He wasn’t 
watching the chaos, he was watching 
the individual players, what they do 
and how they do it.”

This is how a young student of the 

game became a Big Ten Player of the 
Year finalist, as the best player on 
the most surprising team in college 
hockey.

***
Cooper Marody was born on 

December 20, 1996. On its own, it’s 
not a terribly consequential date of 
birth.

In hockey, though, it’s a sentence 

of sorts. Youth hockey is split into 
different age groups based on birth 
year. At an early age, those with 
January or February birthdays are 
often stronger, faster and farther 
along in their physical development 
than those born in November or 
December.

Growing 
up, 
Marody 
knew 

he wasn’t going to outmuscle or 
outskate anybody, at least not just 
yet.

But maybe he could outskill them.
Instead of darting all over the ice 

in an attempt to make an impact, 
Marody let the game come to him, 
eyes scanning all over the rink, 
carefully 
anticipating 
his 
next 

move before incisively doing so. 
His intelligence and calm attitude 
allowed him to make up for his 
physical disadvantages and mentally 
stay ahead of his competition. Know 
when to pass, know when to shoot. 
Know when to lie back, know when 
to go for it.

“There are players that run all over 

the ice, and it looks like they’re doing 
a lot, and there are other players that 
strategize and they anticipate how 
the game is going to go,” Patrick 
Marody said. “... Cooper’s a wait-and-
then-attack type player versus run 
to the front lines, attack and all hell 
breaks out.”

Marody’s voracious appetite for 

highlights also served him well. 
Thanks to his initial exposure to 
the Red Wings, he obsessed over 
Zetterberg’s puck handling and 
Datsyuk’s shiftiness, hoping to 
emulate elements of their playing 
style in his own game.

“(Zetterberg and Datsyuk) are 

extremely good leaders and lead by 
example,” Marody said. “Also just 
puck possession is phenomenal, 
the way they see each other on 
the ice was phenomenal to watch, 
their puck protection, the way they 
work to get open all over the ice. 
And just little things whether it’s 
manipulating a defender’s stick so 
a pass gets through, everything like 
that.”

When the age differences finally 

began to level out and Marody 

caught up physically, he remained a 
step ahead. His skills and intelligence 
were what first attracted Berenson 
to offer Marody a scholarship to 
play hockey at the University of 
Michigan.

“He’s 
got 
hockey 
smarts,” 

Berenson said. “He senses what’s 
going on. He doesn’t waste his effort. 
He’s not one of those players that’s 
skating all over the place for nothing. 
He’s an efficient player … As much 
as he’s a good passer and a good 
playmaker, when he gets around 
the net he can snipe goals as well as 
anybody.”

Added his current coach Mel 

Pearson: “There are some things that 
are God-given that I think you’re 
born with. … Just being able to see 
the ice and hockey IQ. You can get 
better, you can watch the game and 
learn the game, but some of that is 
innate. You just have that, you just 
understand it and he’s got it.”

Pearson compared Marody to a 

quarterback in football or a point 
guard in basketball with his feel for 
the game, a la Tom Brady or Chris 
Paul in skates.

“You understand the game so 

well, you’ve got a real good feel for 
what’s going on and what’s going to 
transpire,” Pearson said. “That feel 
or that sixth sense, that’s what makes 
the great players special.”

***
It didn’t take long for Cary Eades 

to notice what made Marody special.

In 2014, Eades, then the head 

coach and general manager of the 
USHL’s Sioux Falls Stampede, had 
just acquired Marody in a trade with 
the Muskegon Lumberjacks.

Marody had requested the trade 

himself. Muskegon, he said, just 
wasn’t a good fit. The numbers bore 
that out — just 30 points in 58 games 
during the 2013-2014 season, and 
nine in 14 games a year later.

Sioux Falls offered not only a fresh 

start, but a glimpse of the player that 
Marody had the potential to become.

“He came down the right wall 

on the power play on a breakout, 
entered the zone and just a cross-
ice pass, backdoor tap in for 
(current 
Portland 
Winterhawks 

forward) Kieffer Bellows,” Eades 
remembered. “I looked at that and 
said to my assistant, ‘We haven’t seen 
that kind of a play in a while.’ ”

From there, Marody blossomed. 

In 38 games with the Stampede, 
he scored 20 goals and assisted on 
29 more — a per-game figure that 
ranked second in the USHL behind 
only future Michigan superstar Kyle 
Connor.

With 
talented 
linemates 
in 

Bellows (52 points) and current 
Denver forward Logan O’Connor 
(36), Marody and Sioux Falls tore 
through the USHL Playoffs on their 
way to a Clark Cup sweep over none 
other than Muskegon.

“We had instant chemistry, which 

is great,” Marody said. “Team really 
bought in, everybody played their 
role… and that’s an experience I’ll 
never forget and I learned so much 
from.”

Marody stepped on Michigan’s 

campus in the fall of 2015 after 
having proven what he could do at 
the highest level of junior hockey. But 
it didn’t take long for new challenges 
to arise in Ann Arbor.

“Guys were just bigger and 

stronger,” Marody said. “Guys like 
(JT) Compher, Boo Nieves, Justin 
Selman, they were huge, strong guys 
and it’s like, ‘Geez, these guys are like 
grown men.’ ”

Again, though, Marody grew 

up 
quickly, 
practicing 
daily 

against future professionals on the 
Wolverines’ 
talent-laden 
roster. 

While he didn’t explode onto the 
scene the way Connor — a Hobey 
Baker Award Finalist in 2016 — did, 
his 24 points in 32 contests ranked 
fourth among Big Ten freshmen in 
points per game.

It was easy to envision a bright 

future ahead.

“We had him on a line with Tony 

Calderone and Brendan Warren and 
there were nights where that was our 
best line, and Cooper was one of our 
best players,” Berenson said. “Now 
that didn’t happen every night, but it 
happened enough that you saw that 
this kid’s going to be a good player.”

***
Soon after Michigan’s 2015-2016 

season ended with a loss to North 
Dakota in the NCAA Tournament, 
the attrition began. Nieves and 
Selman? Graduated. Connor? Gone. 
Compher? Gone. Michael Downing, 
Zach Werenski and Tyler Motte? All 
gone as well.

All of a sudden, Marody was 

the 
Wolverines’ 
second-leading 

returning scorer. There was no 
hesitation about his role this time — 
Michigan needed a new offensive 
engine, and Marody had the talent to 
fit the bill.

There was one slight problem. 

The 
aforementioned 
attrition 

involved Marody.

A January 2016 bout with 

mononucleosis forced him to miss 
six games. The consequences ran 
deeper than just hockey — the 
illness set him back academically, 
to the point where he was ruled 
ineligible for the first semester of his 
sophomore year.

“Obviously he wasn’t as happy as 

he usually is,” said junior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi. “He’s a pretty happy 
guy, and when he can’t play for pretty 
much a whole year out of two years 
being here it’s really frustrating.”

But the time in which Marody was 

unable to play revealed something 
else about him.

“He wanted to play so bad, and he 

was our best player in practice every 
day,” Berenson said. “He was playing 
on our fifth line with a couple of 
lesser players, but he made that line 
really good, and he made our team 
better even though he wasn’t in our 
lineup.”

Marody seemingly has a gift for 

making the most out of any situation, 
for creating something from nothing. 
He developed a skilled, cerebral 
playing style out of his late birthday. 
And while being held in hockey 
purgatory, he made the weight room 
into a temporary home.

“He just worked really hard off 

ice, making himself stronger, and on 
the ice in practice too, as well as in 
the classroom,” said senior forward 
Dexter Dancs. “... It was a good time 
for him to get stronger physically, so 
he utilized it.”

Even Marody’s ice vision and 

feel for the game — already his 
best attributes — only got stronger. 
Watching his teammates from Yost 
Ice Arena’s press box, five levels 
above the rink, he could process the 
game in a different and valuable way.

But maybe most importantly, his 

desire to suit back up never wavered.

“I think you realize once you’re 

not playing that long, just for 
anybody how much you love it, or 
how much you miss it,” Calderone 
said. “He sat out there for a while 
(due to) unfortunate events, but I 
think he really built up the passion 
again.”

That was clear from the moment 

Marody returned to the ice in 
December 2016, as he instantly 
breathed life into the Wolverines’ 
stagnant offense. In his second game 
back, the third-place game of the 

Great Lakes Invitational, he dished 
out three assists in a 5-4 win over 
Michigan State. One month later, he 
recorded his first career hat-trick — 
in just the second period alone — to 
power Michigan to an upset at No. 11 
Ohio State.

For the second half of the season, 

Marody’s 15 points were by far the 
most on the team. His return was 
everything the Wolverines hoped it 
would be.

Now he just had to prove himself 

over a full season.

***
Michigan finished third-to-last in 

the country in Corsi percentage and 
averaged just 2.6 goals per game in 
2016-2017. The Wolverines’ leader 
in points — then-freshman forward 
Jake Slaker — registered just 21.

This year, however, Marody’s 

emergence 
has 
catapulted 

Michigan’s offense into the upper 
echelon. With 14 goals and a 
whopping 32 assists, he currently 
leads the Big Ten in points with 46, 
and ranks second in the country in 
assists.

“He’s always had the skill, even 

back when I recruited him back 
in the day, he’s always had the 
skill,” Pearson said. “It’s just the 
consistency, doing it game in and 
game out. Anybody can have a decent 
weekend here or there, but when you 
put it together and you’re averaging 
more than a point per game, I think 
that’s a measure of a pretty good 
hockey player.”

Even considering all the questions 

surrounding Michigan before the 
year, ask anybody in the program if 
they anticipated this kind of a season 
from Marody, and the answer is 
matter of fact.

“Yeah, pretty much,” junior 

forward Brendan Warren says. “I’ve 
always known he’s super skilled, and 
we did a lot of skating in the summer, 
and I saw how much work he put in. 
He was looking really good coming 
into this year, so I knew he was going 
to have a big year.”

Adds Dancs: “He’s one of the big 

talents in the Big Ten … if not the 
NCAA, so (I’m) not surprised at all.”

Marody, for his part, credits 

everyone around him for his 
breakout season. His teammates — 
especially his linemates Dancs and 
Calderone. 
Michigan’s 
coaching 

staff. Team culture. And so on and 
so forth.

“I really like the chemistry with 

my linemates,” Marody said. “Dexter 
and Tony, I’ve said many times all the 
great things they do on the ice. Our 
power play’s really starting to click 
now. And just the overall structure 

of our team, the coaching staff has 
been really great implementing the 
new system.”

You could simply chalk that up 

to traditional hockey humility. Until 
you watch Wolverines’ “DMC” top 
line at work.

On one wing, Dancs, the bruiser 

on the boards and in front of the 
net, scraps for pucks and wins 
battles of grit. On the other lies the 
senior captain Calderone, the lethal 
assassin with a laser shot who can 
fire from anywhere.

And in the middle there’s Marody, 

the heartbeat of the offense, coolly 
surveying the ice and threading the 
puck to Dancs and Calderone from 
any angle.

“He’s a passer, and I’m a shooter,” 

Calderone said. “He does all the skill 
stuff, and will slide it over to me, and 
I shoot. That’s my strength, and it 
plays to his strength too.”

For a player with Marody’s gifts, 

it’s a perfect set-up.

“You’ve got to be teamed with 

the right guy, right teammates, 
linemates,” Eades said. “He needs 
a finisher, he needs someone who’s 
going to do the dirty work in the 
corners and get in front of the net.”

That formula has worked wonders 

this season, taking Michigan from 
the nation’s 42nd-highest scoring 
offense to seventh, from 13 wins 
to an almost-guaranteed NCAA 
Tournament bid in a single year.

Fitting, 
perhaps, 
that 
the 

Wolverines’ biggest win of the 
season — and maybe their ticket 
to the dance — was sealed with a 
quintessential DMC goal.

On Feb. 18, with the second period 

winding down in a scoreless game 
against Notre Dame, Dancs closed in 
hard on Fighting Irish defenseman 
Dennis Gilbert, forcing an errant 
pass. Marody grabbed the loose puck 
and skated forward, and as two Notre 
Dame defenders closed in on him, he 
dropped it off for Calderone, wide 
open in the high slot. Michigan’s 
captain made no mistake, firing the 
puck just above Cale Morris’ glove 
for the game’s only goal, and a sweep 
over the nation’s No. 1 team.

“Usually, when we need someone 

to take over a game,” Warren said, 
“Him and maybe Tony or his line, or 
the power play even, will find a way 
to do it.”

That’s exactly what happened 

in Michigan’s Big Ten semifinal 
matchup against Ohio State. The 
Wolverines hadn’t beaten the sixth-
ranked Buckeyes in four meetings, 
and had yet to even come close. 
Marody had registered only a single 
point against them.

But with the road to a Big Ten 

title threatening to end in Columbus, 
Marody did exactly what Warren 
said he would.

In the second period, Marody 

caught the puck in the Ohio State 
crease and dropped it down just in 
time to finesse a chip shot over Sean 
Romeo. A period later, he unleashed 
a tornado-esque spin from the top 
of the slot to tie the score at two, 
where it would stay until the end of 
regulation.

Marody’s performance, however, 

wasn’t enough to win the game for 
his team, as the Buckeyes scored the 
winning goal in overtime.

But it was enough to show, if it 

hadn’t been shown already, that 
Cooper Marody — college hockey 
superstar — had arrived.

***
On March 7, Marody, along with 

Morris and Ohio State forward 
Tanner Laczynski, was named one 
of three finalists for Big Ten Player 
of the Year.

“You don’t necessarily say I want 

to do this and that, or get this many 
points or get this honor,” he says. 
“You just play to be the best player 
you can be, and whatever happens at 
the end of the season is a result. But I 
think if you would have told me that 
this team would be seventh in the 
country… I think that would mean 
more to me.”

Still, it should give Marody 

some more things to think about 
once the season is over. While 
he’s focused solely on Michigan 
and the postseason right now — 
understandably, of course — almost 
everyone around him agrees that 
his professional future is bright. The 
Philadelphia Flyers selected him in 
the sixth round of the NHL Draft in 
2015, and Marody’s play this season 
might convince them to take the leap 
on him.

“Coming out of his year with us 

… (he had) abilities to make it to the 
National Hockey League one day,” 
Eades said. “Those are not things 
that you say lightly.”

Those are strong words, indeed 

— strong enough to make you forget 
that Marody has still only played one 
full year of college hockey.

“I really hope he stays as a college 

player and graduates and is over-
ready when he gets (to the NHL),” 
Berenson said two weeks ago. “... For 
me, it’s an easy decision. You stay at 
Michigan, you continue to grow.”

Added Pearson: “I always think 

if you can continue to improve 
here, there’s no rush. You want to 
make sure you’re ready physically, 
emotionally, spiritually, every way, to 
handle the grinds of pro sports.”

Pearson states that the decision on 

going pro after the season likely will 
ultimately come down to Marody 
and his family. But right now, they 
can afford to take their time.

“His dream was to go to Michigan 

his whole life since he was a little 
boy,” Patrick Marody said. “... We 
didn’t talk about Michigan hockey 
until we got offered, so then you start 
talking about it. Right now you got 
your job to do and just try to focus, 
and I believe that’s the best way. You 
don’t want to get ahead of yourself. 
Stay in the moment.”

And Cooper Marody has waited 

his whole life for this moment. 
No, not waited — studied for it. 
Meticulously prepared for it. Worked 
as hard as he can for it.

A winding road of starts and 

stops, of illness and ineligibility, has 
produced a confident ice general, 
who knows every inch of the rink 
and can make magic happen at any 
given time.

Finally, the student of the game 

can show off everything he has 
learned.

It’s the Friday before the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team will learn its fate, and 
Kim Barnes Arico is playing the 
waiting game. The coach knows 
her team will make the NCAA 
Tournament 
on 
the 
coming 

Monday, but she doesn’t know. 
She’ll never feel comfortable 
knowing again, because she knew 
last year and was wrong.

The Wolverines were left out 

of the NCAA Tournament then, 
and nothing else matters. They 
made the most of their situation, 
winning the Women’s National 
Invitational 
Tournament. 
It 

didn’t heal the wound.

“Especially now with waiting 

for Monday, I think it’s at the top 
of my mind,” Barnes Arico says, 
a conversational tone suddenly 
turning serious. “I think I will 
forever be scarred because of 
that.”

When you spend time around 

this team, you see those scars. 
The goal has been stated time 
and time again, sometimes with a 
measure of defiance. Barnes Arico 
declared Michigan was robbed 
last season during a postgame 
press conference in late January. 
Others take a more diplomatic 
tact — We felt we did enough — but 
the sentiment is still the same.

The Wolverines were told after 

last season they were left out of 
the Tournament due to a lack of 
quality wins, something they took 
measures to correct. Between 
home wins over Marquette and 
Maryland and a victory over Ohio 
State on the road, Michigan has 
three top-25 wins by RPI, where 
last season it had none.

Despite this, Barnes Arico 

refuses to let herself express 
certainty.

“For us it will always be a reality 

of, ‘Okay, you’re never guaranteed,’ 
” she says. “You always gotta 
continue to work and continue to 
improve and continue to get better. 
Because you never know what the 
committee is gonna be looking for 
at any given time.”

With its season on the line, 

Michigan pulled an upset victory 
out of its hat against then-No. 13 
Maryland in the final game of 
the regular season. At the Big 
Ten Tournament, the Wolverines 
added the cherry on top with a 

win over Penn State. That adds 
a measure of confidence to the 
wait, but a degree of worry is still 
there.

After 
all, 
Michigan 
spent 

most of February losing. Beating 
the Terrapins was as close to an 
all-or-nothing proposition the 
Wolverines have had all year for 
just that reason.

Barnes Arico didn’t stress the 

must-win nature of that game 
before it happened because she 
feels Michigan plays worse under 
that kind of pressure. But she 
knew it, and so did everyone else.

After that win, there was 

a palpable relief in the air. 
It has carried over into this 
conversation, where Barnes Arico 
jokes about potential locations 
for the first two rounds. But relief 
isn’t certainty, and Barnes Arico 
won’t be caught mistaking one for 
the other.

***
Michigan has read the same 

book for two years in a row 
as a team, Joshua Medcalf’s 
Chop Wood Carry Water. It’s a 
motivational book, the type of 
thing you read as a team, and one 
part of the story sticks out.

The main character is an 

architect, and a good one at that. 
He’s getting old and is asked to 
build one last house, a task he 
finishes halfheartedly. When the 
job is done, his client gives him 
the key as a gift. The house, one 
of the architect’s worst-ever jobs, 
belongs to him.

“It 
kind 
of 
goes 
with 

basketball,” said junior center 
Hallie Thome at the beginning 
of the season. “You know, like 
building your own house. Each 
and every day you’re building your 
own player on the court, you’re 
building your own confidence, 
and we’re building a team each 
and every practice.”

The book was then-senior, 

now-graduate assistant Danielle 
Williams’ suggestion last year, 
and the Wolverines learned the 
lesson firsthand. They built their 
house, the Selection Show came, 
and then there was no choice but 
to live there.

When Michigan started to look 

lost this year, struggling under the 
weight of expectation that came 
with being ranked as highly as 
13th in the country, Barnes Arico 
turned to the same message.

“When we started to get 

tight and we stopped thinking 
— we started to worry about the 
outcome and not the process — I 
thought that (the book) would be 
a reminder to us, as to why we’re 
doing this and what’s important,” 
Barnes Arico said. “And to bring 
us back to who we are and our 
core values and what our program 
stands for. And it’s just a constant 
reminder of that and just another 
way and another voice other than 
my voice or my assistant coaches’ 
voices — or Jillian (Dunston’s) 
voice.”

Last year, it was Dunston 

who rallied the Wolverines at 
practice the morning after the 
Selection Show, telling them in no 
uncertain terms they would win 
the WNIT and hang a banner.

On Tuesday, that won’t be 

necessary.

***
The Wolverines watched the 

Selection Show at Revel and Roll 
bowling alley last season, renting 
out a suite and inviting media to 
witness an impending celebration 
that never was. This year, they 
took a quieter tack, watching the 
show at Barnes Arico’s house, a 
more open space for catharsis.

The first region came and went 

without Michigan’s name being 
called. When the second did as 
well, the nerves started creeping 
in. Barnes Arico had felt confident 
coming in — there was no reason 
not to — but the tone in the room 
was changing from lighthearted 
to stoic.

“I could see Jilly starting to put 

her hand over her face,” Barnes 
Arico said. “My own children 
were like, ‘We can’t watch 
anymore,’ so I think everyone was 
getting a little stressed.

“... My little one came and sat 

on on my lap and said, ‘Mommy, 
I don’t like this,’ and then my son 
is like, ‘Ah, I don’t feel so good.’ … 
The longer it went, the tighter we 
became.”

Finally, their name was called 

and a year’s worth of emotions 
spilled out of the Wolverines. 
Dunston jumped out of her chair, 
then leapt up and down a few 
more times, turning to Katelynn 
Flaherty, a fellow senior, who 
bounced into her arms to share 
the moment.

“The most devastating part 

for me as a coach last year was 
(seniors) Danielle Williams and 
Siera Thompson didn’t get to 
experience it and what they had 
given to our program through 
the years,” Barnes Arico said. “... I 
didn’t want to leave that hole and 
that emptiness there again with 
Jillian and Katelynn.”

Assistant coach Wesley Brooks 

jumped into the middle of the 
room and let out a roar, turning 
to the ceiling to punctuate his 
exuberance. The entire room 
flew upwards at the same time, 
because what else is there to do 
when you’ve just accomplished 
your goal?

“We didn’t really hear much 

after that,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Thank goodness we recorded 
the show.”

The Wolverines, the seventh 

seed 
in 
the 
Lexington, 
Ky. 

regional, 
will 
play 
No. 
10 

Northern Colorado in Waco, TX. 
on Friday (5 pm, ESPN2). If they 
get by the Bears, No. 2 Baylor 
will likely await, and with it, the 
almost-certain end of Michigan’s 
season.

But that doesn’t matter.
The Wolverines wanted one 

thing from this season: an NCAA 
Tournament 
bid. 
They 
built 

a house big enough to earn it. 
Everything else is just window 
dressing.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

The Michigan women’s basketball team made the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2013 on Monday.

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico will be in the NCAA Tournament for the sixth time in her coaching career.

FINALLY

After just missing out last 

season, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team has made the 
2018 NCAA Tournament.

The Wolverines gathered at 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico’s house to watch the 
Selection Show on Monday 
evening and waited patiently 
for their name to be announced. 
Seniors Katelyn Flaherty and 
Jillian Dunston sat together 
on a big chair. The mood was 
upbeat as Barnes Arico walked 
around and asked everyone 
their predictions.

“I was going around the 

room asking different players 
different questions, and the 
mood was really light,” Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“Everyone 
was 

laughing and having a good 
time.”

Barnes Arico wanted to add 

levity to a tense situation. After 
all, the Wolverines were almost 
guaranteed a spot last year, 
but the show ended without 
Michigan’s name mentioned.

However, as the show went on 

Monday, the Wolverines began 
to get a little bit nervous. The 
memory of waiting hopefully for 
their name to be called last year 
hung in the back of the team’s 
minds.

“By the time bracket two 

was called and we weren’t 
mentioned, no one was really 
talking anymore and everyone 
was a little quiet,” Barnes Arico 
said. “You could see the beads of 
sweat starting to form on some 
of their heads. It was a little 
nerve-racking at that point.”

But then Michigan’s moment 

came.

The Wolverines were finally 

added to the field, and the 
suspense was lifted.

“We were getting a stomach 

ache because it was a while 
through. ... Everyone was getting 
a little stressed,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And then it was Michigan. 
We just jumped up and were 
screaming. 
We 

didn’t really hear 
much after that, 
thank goodness 
we 
recorded 

the show so we 
can go back and 
watch again.”

The 
bid 
is 

Michigan’s first 
since 2013. It’s a 
new experience 
for 
everyone 

on the team, even for seasoned 
veterans Flaherty and Dunston. 
Barnes Arico noted how great 
the moment was for the pair 
after putting in four years of 
hard work, including a Women’s 
National Invitation Tournament 
championship last season.

“Anytime you can get invited 

to the NCAA Tournament is 
a tremendous honor,” Barnes 
Arico said. “The players in 
our program now have never 
experienced that before and 
they’re so deserving. Katelyn 
and 
Jillian 
deserve 
to 
be 

watched on the national screen. 
This is a great opportunity for 
everyone in the country to see 
our team.”

The 
Wolverines 
were 

awarded the No. 7 seed in the 
Lexington 
region 
and 
will 

face the No. 10 seed, Northern 

Colorado, in Waco, Texas on 
March 16.

The Bears are currently on 

a 13-game winning streak that 
included a 91-69 win over Idaho 
to claim the Big Sky Conference 
Tournament Championship.

If Michigan beats Northern 

Colorado then it is likely to face 
the No. 2 seed, Baylor.

The Bears are known as one 

of 
the 
most 

dominant 
programs in the 
nation. They are 
31-1 overall this 
season and went 
undefeated 
in 

the Big 12 and 
are a legitimate 
title contender.

Barnes Arico 

is ready for the 
challenge ahead 

of her team, though. She’s aware 
of the caliber of the teams they 
are about to play but believes 
the Wolverines will rise to the 
occasion.

“Every team in the field of 64 

is a great basketball program 
and every team is fighting to 
survive and advance. Starting 
with 
Northern 
Colorado 
... 

they’re a great program,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Every team is a 
tremendous program so it’ll be 
just fun to have the opportunity 
to play in that environment and 
to survive and advance.

“And then if we’re fortunate 

enough to get through Friday 
then we’ll have an opportunity 
to test ourselves against one 
of the best programs in the 
country.”

The stage is set, and Michigan 

is ready for redemption.
