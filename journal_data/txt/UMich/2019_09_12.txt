University 
of 
Michigan 
Rackham 
student 
Andrea 
Belgrade hosted the opening 
event 
for 
the 
Strength 
of 
Refugees and their Community 
in the Hatcher Graduate Library 
Wednesday night. A group of 
about 50 students and Ann Arbor 
residents attended the event. 
Belgrade does research with 
psychology professor Fiona Lee 
focused on Muslim-Americans, 
self-identified 
multicultural 
people, immigrants and refugees. 
The gallery at the event was an 
extension of her work. 
Belgrade began the discussion 
with a brief introduction on 
her goal for her research with 

refugees: allowing refugees to 
talk about their own experiences 
instead 
of 
having 
their 
experiences discussed on their 
behalf. 
“Refugees are one group that 
are very often talked about, 
but less often, their stories and 
their voices are not centered 
and a part of that conversation,” 
Belgrade said. “While a lot of 
people you might speak to might 
be supportive of refugees, it 
often follows the single story of 
victimization and trauma.” 
The reception led to a panel 
discussion about research the 
panelists had done with refugees. 
Dr. Mari Kira, a psychology 
research 
scientist 
at 
the 
University, 
worked 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Giessen 
and 

University of Marburg, Germany 
in the early 2010s. She said the 
migration of millions of refugees 
to Germany in such a short span 
of time prompted her group to 
begin researching refugees and 
their lives in Germany. 
“We focus on their challenges 
that the resettlement is bringing, 
but also the positive aspects,” 
Kira said. “We grow through 
every experience we have; how 
does the path of refugees help 
them to grow and enriches 
their understanding of not only 
themselves, but also enriches 
their understanding of this world 
and how it works?” 
Kira 
and 
her 
group 
of 
researchers 
studied 
with 
refugees in the U.S., Canada 
and Germany. She was able to 

find commonalities between the 
groups: the loss of control over 
their own life, uncertainty and 
discrimantion. 
“I had a Syrian refugee tell 
me, ‘We here as refugees are 
unsafe,’” Kira said. “‘Maybe one 
day the state will say we are to go 
back to our home country. And 
what should I do there? I lost 
everything there.’” 
Ayah Kutmah is the co-founder 
of 
REvive, 
an 
organization 
that goes “beyond the scope” 
of 
United 
Nations 
refugee 
resettlement organizations. She 
spoke about how stereotypes of 
refugees as helpless and in need 
of others’ help does more harm 
than good.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Approximately 
150 
community members filled 
the pews of First United 
Methodist Church to hear 
Sister Helen Prejean, a 
renowned author and nun, 
discuss her book “River of 
Fire,” released in August. 
She described what it was 
like to see injustice impact 
others and her advocacy 
work.

“We can’t make ourselves 
wake up,” Prejean said. “We 
can show up for things like 
this where someone’s going 
to be blowing on the coals 
and a fire might happen, 
but it’s always grace when 
we wake up. And it doesn’t 
matter when we wake up. 
It’s what we do after that I 
think is really important.”
Prejean, who has been 
featured on “The Oprah 
Winfrey 
Show” 
and 
in 
the The New York Times, 

began life as a nun at age 
18. Her first book, “Dead 
Man Walking,” was turned 
into an opera and Academy 
Award-winning film.
During 
her 
talk, 
she 
discussed 
her 
transition 
from a nun who grew 
up shielded from other 
cultures to living a life 
entirely devoted to social 
justice. 
Specifically, Prejean has 
been an advocate against 
capital 
punishment. 

Prejean 
said 
she 
was 
inspired by an imprisoned 
pen pal, who was killed on 
death row two-and-a-half 
years after they met.
When 
“Dead 
Man 
Walking” was released in 
the early 1990s, 80 percent 
of Americans supported the 
death penalty. Prejean said 
she attributes this support 
to fear and sees her role as 
changing the conversation.

Move 
over, 
avocado 
— 
there’s 
a 
new 
shortage 
rocking 
American 
college 
students. 
The 
country 
is 
facing the first-ever shortage 
of White Claw Hard Seltzer. 
White Claw is the hard 
seltzer 
industry’s 
prized 
possession, accounting for 
nearly 5 percent of all hard 
seltzer sales the week of July 
4 this year. Drink sales have 
grown 283 percent over the 
last year and have outgrown 
the 
speed 
of 
production. 
White Claw confirmed to 
CNN Business there is a 
nationwide shortage of their 
product. 
White 
Claw 
President 
Phil Rosse said in an email 
statement to The Daily they 
are actively working to ensure 
stock returns to normal. 
“White Claw is currently 
growing at 260 percent for the 
third consecutive year – all 
thanks to consumers that love 
our product,” Rosse said. “We 
are working around the clock 
to increase current supply 
and total capacity heading 
into 2020 so that we can 
get every consumer White 
Claw when they want it.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
doesn’t 
think 
President 
Donald Trump is blowing 
smoke when it comes to 
dealing with the youth vaping 
epidemic. She praised the 
Trump Administration on 
Wednesday for its intention to 
finalize a compliance policy 
that would clear the market of 
unauthorized, 
non-tobacco-
flavored e-cigarette products. 
Last 
week, 
Michigan 
became the first state in 
the nation to ban flavored 
nicotine products, after Dr. 
Joneigh Khaldun, Whitmer’s 
chief 
medical 
executive, 
determined that youth vaping 
constituted a public health 
emergency. 
Whitmer applauded the 
Trump 
administration 
for 
their parallel move.
“I’m 
glad 
this 
administration is doing the 
right thing and following 
Michigan’s 
lead 
to 
ban 
flavored vaping products,” 
Whitmer said. “This is great 
news for our kids, our families, 
and our overall public health… 
Banning these flavors is a bold 
step that will keep our kids 
healthy and safe from the 
harmful effects of vaping. I’m 
proud that Michigan has been 
a leader on this issue, and I’m 
ready to continue working 
to protect our kids and our 

public health.” 
In a statement, Alex Azar, 
U.S. 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services secretary, explained 
the decision was an effort to 
combat the harmful effects of 
youth vaping.

“The 
Trump 

Administration 
is 
making 
it clear that we intend to 
clear the market of flavored 
e-cigarettes to reverse the 
deeply concerning epidemic 
of youth e-cigarette use that is 
impacting children, families, 
schools, and communities,” 
Azar said. “We will not stand 
idly by as these products 
become 
an 
on-ramp 
to 
combustible 
cigarettes 
or 
nicotine 
addiction 
for 
a 
generation of youth.”
Last week, the University 
of Michigan released the 
annual Monitoring the Future 
Panel 
Study, 
which 
has 
tracked substance use among 
American college students 
and non-college youth since 
the 1980s. The study found 
dramatic increases in the 
vaping 
of 
marijuana 
and 
nicotine among young adults 
nationally. 
John Schulenberg, the 
principal 
investigator 
of the Monitoring the 
Future 
Panel 
Study, 
discussed 
how 
public 
perception 
of 
vaping 
has a dramatic effect on 
youth usage.

A petition circulating around 
campus and the greater Ann 
Arbor community is calling on the 
University of Michigan to release 
the papers of Dr. John Tanton, 
a U-M alum and pioneer of the 
anti-immigration movement in 
the United States.
The petition, entitled “Tell 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan: 
Stop Hiding White Nationalist’s 
Papers From The Public,” had 
more than 3,600 signatures as of 
Wednesday evening. The petition 
was created by third-year Law 
student Kerry Martin in an effort 
to raise awareness about Tanton’s 
ties 
to 
white 
nationalism, 
eugenics 
and 
anti-immigrant 
movements.
Tanton donated his collection 
of papers dating back to 1984 to the 
University’s Bentley Historical 

Library. The entire collection of 
records totals 25 boxes. Boxes 
numbered one to 14 are “open 
without restriction” according 
to the Bentley Library, but boxes 
15 to 25 are to remain sealed 
until April 6, 2035, per Tanton’s 
request upon donation. Martin 
and other petition supporters 
argue that the remaining boxes 
should be revealed to the public 
sooner because of their potential 
connections 
to 
the 
current 
political landscape surrounding 
immigration.
“The petition is supposed to 
shine light on what the University 
might be hoping to do in the 
privacy of its archives and legal 
department 
and 
demonstrate 
that this touches a nerve with the 
community that the University 
is accountable to,” Martin said. 
“University of Michigan is hiding 
papers that most likely draw a 

direct link between the author of 
those papers and anti-immigrant 
sentiment at the highest levels of 
our nation.”
The petition is part of the larger 
debate 
over 
the 
University’s 
choice to keep the documents 
sealed. In December 2016, after 
reading a New York Times feature 
on Tanton, Hassan Ahmad, an 
immigration activist and attorney 
based 
in 
Washington, 
D.C., 
requested through the Freedom 
of Information Act the records in 
the remaining 11 boxes be made 
available to the public. After his 
request was denied, Ahmad filed 
an administrative appeal with 
the University, which was also 
rejected.
“The lack of transparency 
from the University is really 
alarming to me,” Ahmad said. 
“Why are they trying so hard 
to hide the papers of John 
Tanton? John Tanton was 
a white nationalist, he 
believed that Latinos were 
uneducable (and) he led 
the effort to make English 
the official language of the 
United States… every single 
idea he tossed up was anti-
immigrant.”
In June 2017, Ahmad 
filed a lawsuit against the 
University. The case was 
dismissed 
the 
following 
November. 
After 
that, 
Ahmad teamed up with his 
associate and a Michigan 
FOIA expert, Philip Ellison, 
to fight the University in 
court. They filed an appeal 
with the Michigan Court 
of Appeals and held oral 
arguments in Detroit in 
August 2018, arguing that 
the papers are considered 
public record and cannot be 
withheld by the University. 
The Court of Appeals ruled 
in Ahmad’s favor in June 
2019, reversing the 2017 
decision.
The University is still 
debating whether to release 
the remaining boxes of 

sealed records prior to the 2035 
date. University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
that if the University chooses 
to uncover the papers against 
Tanton’s wishes, it could affect 
the likelihood of future donors 
choosing the University as the 
place for their own collections.
“The university argues, in 
part, that ‘… the Court of Appeals’ 
decision will have the paradoxical 
effect of impeding public access 
to knowledge,’” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“‘If gift agreements requiring any 
period of delayed public access 
are deemed unenforceable under 
FOIA, no one will donate records 
to a public library under such an 
agreement, and the public will 
lose access to records of invaluable 
historical significance.’”
The University also argues 
that the first 14 boxes are already 
available to the public, which 
should be utilized and researched 
in the meantime. However, Martin 
discredited this claim, citing his 
experience in the legal field.
“As a law student, I know 
the value of sifting through 
massive document dumps, and 
sometimes it is in ‘Box 18’ that 
you find what you need,” Martin 
said. “With another 11 boxes of 
his papers, we’re fairly confident 
that that picture of Dr. Tanton 
could come into clearer view, and 
therefore the illegitimate and 
insidious biases behind the Trump 
administration’s 
immigration 
policies can come into clearer view 
as well.”
Tanton earned graduate degrees 
in medicine and ophthalmology 
from the University in 1960 
and 1964, respectively. He was 
the founder and an executive 
of 
various 
anti-immigration 
organizations starting in the late 
1970s, including the Federation for 
American Immigration Reform, 
Center for Immigration Studies 
and NumbersUSA.

Among 
the 
ethnicity 
designations 
available 
is 
the Middle Eastern/North 
African identity option. In 
2017, 
ME/NA-identifying 
students 
formed 
the 
#WeExist campaign, asking 
the University to add the 
ME/NA identity category to 
University documents. 
At the time, the University 
followed the U.S. Census, 
which 
does 
not 
have 
a 
ME/NA 
identity 
category. 
Thus, 
ME/NA-identifying 
individuals can only mark 
themselves as white or other, 
which 
many 
— 
including 
Public Policy senior Arwa 
Gayar, co-present of the Arab 
Student Association — feel 
do not accurately represent 
their identity. 
“There 
was 
something 
uneasy about putting white, 
and I didn’t want to put 
African American because 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
co-opt 
the 
experience 
of 
Black 
Americans,” Gayar said. “So I 
always put ‘other’ and always 
felt like my identity was 
forgotten and overlooked.”
Though 
the 
Common 
Application and the Coalition 
Application 
— 
the 
only 

applications 
used 
by 
the 
University for undergraduate 
admissions 
— 
include 
a 
ME/NA identity option, it 
falls under the white racial 
category. 
Accordingly, 
ME/NA identity data has 
historically 
been 
reported 
under white identity data.
Since its inception, the 
campaign 
has 
succeeded 
in moving the University 
to 
disaggregate 
ME/NA 
identity 
data 
from 
white 
identity 
data 
on 
internal 
University documents, such 
as on surveys, undergraduate 
admissions applications and 
Rackham Graduate School 
admissions applications.
The 
email 
explained 
some students may find the 
extended 
ethnicity 
data 
they 
shared 
during 
the 
admissions process already 
entered in Wolverine Access. 
The email also noted the 
new process gives students 
“greater flexibility in their 
identification.”
University 
alum 
Jad 
Elharake, a founder of the 
#WeExist 
campaign, 
said 
using admissions applications 
to 
collect 
ethnicity 
data 
is the most efficient and 
effective, as every student 
at the University must fill 
out the form. He expressed 
excitement 
for 
the 
new 

extended ethnicity process 
on 
Wolverine 
Access, 
which he sees as a means to 
collect 
potentially 
useful 
supplemental data on the 
student population. 
To Elharake, however, the 
new 
ethnicity 
designation 
process is also critical for 
better 
understanding 
the 
University’s faculty and staff 
population, for which there 
is no mechanism such as 
admissions applications to 
collect ethnicity data. 
“It’s great that this collects 
extended 
ethnicity 
data 
for students, but the more 
important takeaway is this 
process collects this data for 
faculty and staff,” Elharake 
said. “This was a big push for 
us early on … We wanted to 
know how faculty members 
and staff identify as ME/
NA.”
With this data, Elharake 
said, statistical analysis could 
be done on a variety of topics, 
such 
as 
potential 
racial 
discrimination 
in 
hiring 
and trends on promotions 
and appointments. The data 
could also illuminate issues 
of representation, such as 
how many staff and faculty 
of a given identity there are 
across different units, and 
if the makeup of faculty and 
staff reflects the student 

population. 
“If you don’t have data, 
you can’t defend your needs 
and 
the 
issues 
of 
your 
community,” Elharake said. 
“You might not even know 
some of the issues that are 
happening.”
LSA senior Silan Fadlallah, 
founding sister and president 
of 
Epsilon 
Alpha 
Sigma, 
the first Arab sorority in 
the United States, was also 
a leader in the #WeExist 
campaign. She noted the data 
could help the University 
better understand how to 
fund 
ME/NA 
groups 
on 
campus. 
“It gives the University an 
idea of how many of us there 
are, and how they should allot 
their resources,” Fadlallah 
said. “If you see there is this 
racial category not being 
accounted for, once you do 
account for us, you’ll further 
be able to assess where your 
funding should go, and how 
you should support these 
students.” 
Gayar 
also 
expressed 
excitement for the process 
and said she hopes to see 
the 
data 
used 
to 
better 
understand the disparities 
between various University 
communities. However, she 
worried about the possibility 
of the data being misused. 

“I think the Arab and 
Muslim community has had 
a history of being surveilled 
by security institutions and 
political institutions,” Gayar 
said. “While it’s difficult 
to imagine U-M using their 
data like that, I still think 
we 
should 
be 
cautionary 
and make sure data on our 
population is treated like data 
from any other population.”
With the new extended 
ethnicity 
process, 
the 
information could be useful 
for other ethnicity groups as 
well. LSA senior Dim Mang, 
co-chair 
of 
United 
Asian 
American 
Organizations, 
said 
she 
would 
like 
to 
see 
extended 
ethnicity 
data address the needs of 
underrepresented 
Asian 
American ethnicity groups 
who, according to Mang, are 
often overshadowed by larger 
groups in analysis of general 
Asian-Pacific 
Islander 
American identity data. 
“There’s this inclination 
to serve the needs of really 
big groups, like Chinese-
Americans, 
Korean-
Americans, which is really 
important, but I feel like 
there’s lots of smaller subsets 
of 
Asian 
Americans 
who 
often really feel neglected 
in conversations about their 
own 
communities,” 
Mang 

said. “I hope they try to use 
this data to figure out what 
those 
communities 
need 
while looking at what our 
community needs as a whole 
at the same time.”
However, Mang noted the 
process is voluntary. She 
speculated this may lead to 
data not reflective of the 
entire student population. 
“I think it’s interesting 
that it’s voluntary, because 
then how emblematic of the 
student body are your results 
actually going to be?” Mang 
said. “So I don’t know how 
effective it will be, but I do 
think it’s important for the 
University to do something.”
Overall, while Fadlallah 
said she finds the extended 
ethnicity 
process 
a 
good 
start, she said she hopes the 
University continues making 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
visibility and representation 
of 
ME/NA-identifying 

students. 
“At this point I feel like 
the University is just now 
starting to understand we 
are here,” Fadlallah said. 
“It’s about time that they do, 
and that they start moving 
forward and talking with the 
students on campus to see 
what they need.”

ETHNICITY
From Page 1A

“You can see close 
up what it means to 
give the government 
power to take another 
human being.”

“The majority of people 
will immediately say that 
the stereotype of refugees 
is that they are possible 
terrorists,” Kutmah said. “Yet 
these stereotypes are often 
linked to the far-right. The 
(predominant) 
stereotype 
of refugees is on that we all 
buy into: the stereotype that 
they are weak, that they are 
helpless, they are victims. 
The story we propagate is 
that these other people that 
look different than us … need 
us to help them.” 
Kutmah said she wants 
refugees 
to 
be 
seen 
as 
individuals 
who 
have 
potential, not victims that all 
share the same story. 
“What if we saw their 
potential?” 
Kutmah 
asks. 
“What 
if 
we 
saw 
each 
refugee as having individual 
potential, the same way we 
ask a kindergarten teacher to 
see each student to imagine 
their dreams?”
Dr. 
Odessa 
Gonzalez 
Benson, assistant professor 
of social work, and her team 
have partnered to do research 
with 
a 
migrant 
based 
organization that deal with 
mothers of missing migrants. 
The organization hopes to 
eventually pull from its oral 
history and data to create a 
website and an exhibit with 
the mothers as the main 
storytellers. 
“We want to feature the 
story of them as advocats,” 
Benson 
said. 
“So 
these 

mothers are the leaders of 
the movement that’s calling 
on 
Italian 
and 
Tunisian 
governments to find solutions 
to their missing sons.” 
Benson quickly introduced 
refugee and the president of 
the Bhutanese Community 
of Michigan, Dilli Gautam to 
speak about his experiences. 
Gautam focused not on his 
experience 
as 
a 
refugee 
but rather his experience 
as a mentor. He related a 
particular story of a young 
man named John who had 
only been in America for six 
days when Gautam met him. 
“Any newcomer, I ask him 
to write down my phone 
number a few times on a 
piece of paper so they can 
remember it … and call me if 
they need anything outside 
school,” Gautam said. “It 
was a challenge at first to 
teach him how to hold a pen, 
how to place a piece of paper 
on a table and how to write 
numbers correctly.”
Guatam received a phone 
call at one in the morning 
from an unknown number. 
It was a man who had found 
John wandering the streets 
and the only thing John could 
tell him was Gautam’s phone 
number. Gautam picked him 
up and drove him to the high 
school. Apparently, John had 
gotten lost buying milk for 
his brother. 
“Imagine how his parents 
must have felt.” Gautam said. 
“Imagine 
how 
vulnerable 
John must have felt.”
Guatam said John joined 
the 
Marines 
and 
Gautam 
believes 
John’s 
enlistment 

is a perfect example of how 
refugees can stand up for 
themselves and for others 
when shown proper guidance.
Once 
the 
panel 
had 
concluded 
their 
talking 
points, the audience made 
comments 
and 
asked 
questions. 
One 
audience 
member in particular asked 
why mental health was not 
discussed more. All four of 
the panelists agreed mental 
health should be a large part 
of the resettlement process. 
 
However, they found that 
sometimes the nations which 
they migrated to do not list 
mental health as a priority 
even for their own citizens. 
LSA senior Noor Saleem 
assisted Belgrade with the 
research. 
Saleem 
is 
also 
a refugee and spent her 
time translating English to 
Arabic when meeting with 
the individuals engaged in 
the research program. She 
was most surprised by how 
different everyone’s stories 
are. 
“Personally, I am a refugee, 
so 
I 
have 
been 
through 
many life events so I have a 
background of both knowing 
how to feel as a refugee,” 
Saleem said. “But to them 
when I was asking them 
questions, they were telling 
their stories and each one has 
a specific story that’s very 
uniques to them and that was 
very special about it. Before 
I was kind of generalizing 
‘Oh, 
refugees, 
they’ve 
all 
been through a lot.’ But no, 
everyone has a certain degree 
and certain tolerance of what 
they can handle.’”

REFUGEES

“It’s 
really 
tied 
into 
people’s perceptions of harm,” 
Schulenberg said. “That is, 
how much harm do you think 
someone’s doing if they vape 
frequently or regularly, and 
when perception of harm goes 
up, it goes down, and vice 
versa, when perceptions of 
harm go down, use goes up.” 
Schulenberg 
noted 
the 
trends identified in the study 
might shift given the recent 
spate of high profile injuries 
connected to vaping that left 
users hospitalized.
“What’s happening the past 
couple of months, it’s kind of 
going against it, people do see 
it as a big thing,” Schulenberg 
said. “But, you know, our data 
were collected in 2017-2018, 
before 
all 
these 
tragedies 
with people ending up in 
emergency rooms because of 
vaping.”
LSA 
junior 
Blaine 
Thompson 
said 
he 
was 
frustrated by Whitmer’s ban, 
citing the lack of streamlined 
policy-making. 

“Targeting 
and 
banning 
an entire industry on the 
basis of a shaky hypothesis 
is juvenile, to say the least,” 
Thompson 
said. 
“On 
top 
of that, going around the 

elected 
representatives 
of 
the state by declaring a state 
of 
‘emergency’ 
is 
wildly 
tyrannical.”
Thompson 
went 
on 
to 
express discontent with the 
Trump 
administration’s 
decision to follow Whitmer’s 

lead. He said a ban negatively 
impacts 
individuals 
who 
use the products to break 
their addiction to cigarettes 
without the artificial tobacco 
flavor. 
“It’s so premature and it 
does nothing but hurt the 
people that use it for what it’s 
designed for but happen to 
hate the fake tobacco flavor,” 
Thompson said. 
Schulenberg 
concluded 
with a warning. While vaping 
may seem like a harmless 
pastime, 
the 
threat 
of 
a 
lifetime of addiction looms 
constantly over any and all 
users. 
“The thing with nicotine 
is 
that 
it’s 
addictive,” 
Schulenberg said. “And I can 
imagine people want to try 
vaping. There’s a buzz around 
it, and it seems to be culturally 
sanctioned – it’s legal, if 
you’re 21 or some places 18. 
And so what’s the big deal? 
The big deal, in addition to 
what we’re seeing with all 
these 
tragedies 
— 
people 
ending up in emergency rooms 
— is that it’s hard to get away 
from nicotine once it’s got a 
hold of you.”

E-CIGS

“I 
could 
sense 
it’s 
because they had been 
made to be afraid that 
there’s some people so 
evil we can’t put them 
in prison because they 
would kill other people,” 
Prejean said. 
Ashley 
Lucas, 
Prison 
Creative 
Arts 
Project 
director at the University 
of Michigan, introduced 
Prejean 
at 
the 
event. 
Lucas 
commended 
Prejean for her advocacy 
on the issue.
“My 
friend, 
Sister 
Helen 
Prejean, 
is 
a 
Louisiana 
nun 
from 
the Congregation of St. 
Joseph, and it is my belief 
that she has done more for 
the 
national 
movement 
to end the death penalty 
than any other person 
in U.S. History,” Lucas 
said. “Those who know 
her work feel a kind of 
reverence one can only 
feel for holy people … 
Sister Helen fills me with 
a kind of awe that I feel 
for very few people.”
Prejean 
discussed 
coming of age in the 
1960s, 
as 
the 
Second 
Vatican was addressing 
the 
Catholic 
Church’s 
place 
in 
the 
outside 
world. She recounted her 
experience 
of 
dressing 
up in the clothing of 
widowed women to go out 
and explore the world.
Additionally, 
Prejean 
described the experience 
of watching her pen pal be 
executed as her spark-

starting 
moment 
and 
changed 
the 
trajectory 
of her life into one of 
advocacy.
“You can see close up 
what it means to give 
the 
government 
power 
to take another human 
being,” Prejean said. “A 
conscious, 
imaginative 
human being whose been 
in his cell for 20, 30 years 
and then being taken out 
and 
to 
his 
execution. 
Once you see it, it’s that 
fire in your soul and you 
can’t unsee it.”
Community 
member 
Jane 
Van 
Slembrouck 
said Prejean’s discussion 
of finding fire in life 

specifically 
resonated 
with her. 
“I loved the way she 
talked about finding that 
moment of fire in your 
life,” 
Van 
Slembrouck 
said. “A moment that’s 
transformative. 
Some 
kind of experience that 
you can clearly define a 

before and an after. For 
her, it was the moment of 
witnessing the execution, 
but I think she was trying 
to say each of us should 
seek out those moments 
when we feel fire in us 
and take that forward 
into our lives.”
During 
a 
question-
and-answer 
portion 
following 
the 
talk, 
Prejean emphasized the 
importance of bringing 
women into conversations 
— especially in places 
where 
women 
have 

historically 
been 

underrepresented, 
like 
the Catholic Church.
“When we look at the 
health of the church and 
what is happening with 
the priests, we see that 
we are not at all a healthy 
church,” 
Prejean 
said. 
“We need the wisdom of 
women.”

University 
alum 

Mia 
Hutchinson, 
who 
participated 
in 
PCAP 
while 
enrolled 
as 
a 
student, also emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
supporting prisoners as 
they are often voiceless in 
society.
“People in prison are 
looked upon as lying on 
the outskirts of society, 
and I think they aren’t 
given much attention from 
the 
everyday, 
average 
person,” Hutchinson said. 
“The more people stand 
up and rally around these 
people who don’t have a 
voice at all, it can really 
shed 
a 
light 
on 
their 
situation.”

SOCIAL JUSTICE
From Page 1A

At 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, students were 
troubled over the news. 
White Claw Hard Seltzer 
has become a staple around 
the 
University 
campus, 
whether in the hands of 
students being arrested for 
underage drinking during 
a game day or being passed 
around in their decorative 
white case at a day party.
LSA 
senior 
Max 
Lederman 
said 
he 
was 
expecting White Claws to be 
popular during the school 
year, but was not prepared 
for just how prominent they 
would be on campus. 
“Coming 
off 
of 
the 
summer I definitely knew 
that 
White 
Claw 
was 
gaining a lot of popularity,” 
Lederman said. “But I had 
no idea that when I came 
to Michigan it was going to 
be as widely consumed as 
it has been. Like I’ve seen 
it at every tailgate, every 
pregame that I’ve been to. 
People are just really sippin’ 

on them.” 
Lederman, whose favorite 
flavor of the drink is ruby 
grapefruit, said he thinks 
White Claw is a lighter 
substitute for beer, which 
he finds harder to drink. 
“It’s a nice alternative to 
drinking beer, just because 
when you drink beer you 
get really full. It makes your 
stomach upset, but you can 
drink a lot of White Claws,” 
Lederman said. “They’re 
also just refreshing.”
 
Information 
senior 
Rachel Rothstein, who also 
prefers the ruby grapefruit 
flavor, agreed White Claw 
provided a better alternative 
to hard liquor.
“I think that it’s an easy 
drink that tastes good, so 
you can drink slowly and it 
still has the same effect,” 
Rothstein said. 
Rothstein said since her 
friends have been buying 
the drink in bulk, she feels 
her 
community 
at 
the 
University would be directly 
affected by a shortage. 
“In my house, everybody 
drinks White Claw, and 
if I didn’t know about the 

shortage from the news, I 
would have no idea because 
people in my house buy at 
least seven packs a week,” 
Rothstein said. 
However, 
according 
to 
Robert Kesto, owner of Ann 
Arbor’s Champion’s Party 
Store, U-M students have 
nothing to worry about. 
Kesto said they have more 
than enough of the spiked 
seltzer and don’t expect to 
run out any time soon. 
“We have not run out, and 
we’re a busy store,” Kesto 
said. “Welcome Week is the 
busiest week of the year, 
and we didn’t run out, so I 
don’t think we will ever run 
out.”
Kesto actually remarked 
that Natural Light Seltzer 
has been just as popular 
lately and has been taking 
some sales away from White 
Claw.
“In my store, Natty Light 
has taken half of their 
sales,” Kesto said. 
Either way, it might not 
be a bad idea for students 
to stock up while they still 
can.

M

ore often than not, 
the 
line 
between 
knowledge 
and 
fact is blurry. Knowledge is 
a 
combination 
of 
fact 
and 
experience. 
Facts 
are 
the 
empirical orders of the world 
and the social rules that shape 
mindsets, and experiences are 
personal 
documentations 
of 
charting the unknown and the 
unique perspectives that result 
from those journeys. Both must 
intertwine and support each 
other to create knowledge, but 
one cannot replace the other. 
The unknown: we are told at 
a young age to embrace, explore 
and experience it. What we 
aren’t told is that the burden of 
expectations that accompanies 
our identities can limit both the 
beautiful potential and harmful 
consequences of the unknown. 
The unknown is filtered based 
on race, sex, gender, sexuality, 
nationality, ethnicity and other 
divisions in society. Breaking 
those barriers and gaining the 
privilege to dissociate from the 
stipulations of our identities and 
fully experience the unknown is 
easier for some than for others. 
But it is important for everyone 
to be able to try. 
I grew up critically aware of 
the color of my skin, and how it 
outlined the expectations for me 
as an Indian American. From 
spending hours shuffling through 
cheap, off-brand makeup to 
find the perfect foundation, to 
trying to create a playlist that 
was not “too Indian” or “too 
American,” the first 18 years 
of my life were spent artfully 
incorporating my Indian identity 
into my American one. This 
included exploring my heritage 
through its art forms, literature, 
language and pop culture while 
concealing those interests under 
an artificial persona – one of 
which the Americans would 
approve. I was presented with 
a dichotomy of beliefs. “Indian” 
meant traditional, beautifully 
vibrant and ethnically distinct. 
“American” meant the right 
to free will, a plethora of 
opportunities and change. What 
resulted was an internalized 
struggle to satisfy the two, as on 
the one hand the unknown was 
forbidden and on the other, it 
was an entity to be discovered. 
These empirical and social 
facts served as the framework 
for the rest of my life, and my 
role within it seemed engraved 
in stone. My Indian culture 
presented a rulebook to foster 

my mindset, and my American 
culture paradoxically presented 
me with an array of opportunities 
without the freedom to pursue 
them. As a result, my experiences 
were limited to living up to the 
textbook expectations of the 
Indian American community 
and beating myself up every time 
I faltered. 
The burden of expectations 
began taking a toll. While I could 
pretend to like math and tolerate 
spice, 
the 
artificial 
passion 
for medicine, as I struggled to 
mirror my peers and idealize 
the dreams that were laid out 
for me, withered away in the 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
real 
world. 
Everything about me, from 
my career aspirations to my 
opinions, were not my own. 
They were reflections of the 
stereotypes the members and 
outsiders of my community 
had for me. Identity, in any 
capacity is what makes an 
individual remarkably unique. 

But often times we do ourselves 
a disservice by limiting our 
experiences to those of people 
who have similar identities. 
While there is a certain sense of 
comfort and stability in holding 
a shared set of beliefs and values, 
these frameworks must serve as 
reinforcement for a path to be 
taken on one’s own accord, not 
the path itself. 
I eventually realized that 
despite a massive immigrant 
generational 
gap 
— 
from 
explaining to my parents that it 
is normal to have a date to the 
senior prom to convincing them 
it is OK to change my field of 
study half way through college, 
and everything in between — in 
principle, our journeys were the 
same. At my age, my parents were 
newlyweds in a foreign country 
tasked with survival while I am 
blessed with self-actualization. 
For them, the United States was 
the unknown, and they were to 
embark on a journey that few 

had before them. Surviving 
meant sacrificing passions for 
sustenance. For me, breaking 
free from the shackles of 
social rules and having the 
opportunity 
to 
make 
that 
journey uniquely mine is the 
unknown. It is up to me how 
I define self-actualization – 
lining up certain experiences 
that force myself to wrestle 
with my hyphenated identity 
or maximizing my full potential 
and embracing what it truly 
means. 
Circumstances, 
and 
the 
subsequent 
experiences 
they 
create, 
vary 
starkly 
across cultures and societies. 
It was my responsibility to 
take ownership and advantage 
over them, to allow them 
to 
complement 
the 
Indian 
traditions so deeply rooted in 
me, in order to build my own 
knowledge and understanding 
of the real world, just like my 
parents did. Deviating from the 
mindset my Indian community 
cultivated in me for 18 years 
and instead delving into the 
unknown, even the parts the 
social rule book prohibits me 
from, has empowered me to 
discover my passion and its 
subsequent purpose. 
As college signified a fresh 
start, I knew that I had the 
potential to gain four years’ 
worth 
of 
experiences 
to 
accompany my “Indianness” 
and learn what my place in 
society is, beyond that of the 
typical 
Indian 
American. 
From taking classes I never 
expected to take before, to 
experimenting with friendships 
and relationships, I learned that 
my community of Indians is my 
strength but my passions and 
purposes were two enigmas 
that I needed to uncover and 
etch for myself. 
The 
unknown 
is 
unfathomable. But it presents a 
host of opportunities, ones that 
cannot necessarily be defined by 
what we were told or encouraged 
to 
believe. 
Experiences 
we 
make for ourselves, ones that 
challenge us and force us to 
think critically may initially be 
difficult or seem impossible. 
Through charting the unknown, 
however, 
we 
inadvertently 
discover ourselves and establish 
roles that expand and build on 
our unique identities and offer a 
unique perspective reflective of 
our journeys.

Overcoming “model minority” expectations

B

ees 
are 
often 
seen 
as one of mankind’s 
most beloved animals. 
Whether it be the buzz over 
Honey Nut Cheerios or Jerry 
Seinfeld’s sarcastic character 
Barry from the “Bee Movie,” 
we seem to have a greater 
affinity 
for 
these 
striped 
insects than we do for their 
six-legged 
relatives. 
Man-
made bee habitats scattered 
throughout 
campus, 
most 
notably in the East Quad 
Residence Hall garden, reflect 
this love. Even so, the bee 
population is still struggling 
to maintain its numbers due 
to habitat loss and the often 
avoidable use of pesticides. 
On 
a 
sunny 
Monday 
morning in September 2016, 
beekeepers in and around the 
town of Smallville, N.C., found 
their hives — and livelihoods 
— in tatters. Millions of bees 
littered the ground, clumped 
together in mangled balls of 
crooked legs and motionless 
wings. 
 
Areas 
that 
were 
once filled with the hum of 
thousands of honeybees were 
now silent. Juanita Stanley, 
one of the affected beekeepers, 
recalled her initial reaction 
to 
The 
New 
York 
Times: 
“Honestly, I just fell to the 
ground. I was crying, and I 
couldn’t quit crying, and I was 
throwing up.”
Beekeepers 
immediately 
set out to discover the culprit 
behind the deaths of their 
bees. They found that their 
county 
had 
haphazardly 
aerially sprayed a pesticide, 
Naled, the day before in order 
to 
eradicate 
mosquitoes, 
inadvertently killing tens of 
thousands of honeybees in the 
process.
The county administrator, 
Jason 
Ward, 
half-heartedly 
apologized 
for 
the 
issue, 
saying “We’ve learned that 
the 
beekeeping 
community 
in Dorchester County, and 
in that area in particular, is 
larger than we were aware of.” 

Pesticide sprays — targeted 
at pests like mosquitoes — 
are 
becoming 
increasingly 
common throughout United 
States, killing countless bees 
and destroying hives. While 
deaths of captive bees on 
this scale due to pesticide 
sprays are rare, the chemicals 
are 
known 
to 
devastate 
populations of wild bees and 
dozens of other insect species. 
According to bee researcher 
Dennis 
vanEngelsdorp, 
“if 
you’re 
killing 
honeybees, 
you’re killing a lot of other 
non-honeybee pollinators, too, 
and those populations could 
take a long time to recover.” 
Since the negative effects 
of 
pesticides 
on 
insect 
populations 
still 
not 
fully 
known, one can only guess 
how many insects and animals 
— beloved or not — have 
been killed in the crossfire 
in the war against pests, like 
zika-carrying 
mosquitoes. 
An 
unexpected 
alternative 
brings hope to the situation, 
however, 
giving 
the 
bees 
a chance to buzz on. The 
unintentional slaughter from 
pesticide 
use 
is 
pushing 
some Southern states to look 
towards genetic modification 
as a sustainable alternative, 
altering 
the 
reproductive 
systems of pests in order to 
disrupt 
their 
populations. 
Genetically 
modified 
mosquitoes have been released 
in Africa and South America 
to fight zika and malaria-
carrying 
mosquito 
species 
with 
considerable 
success. 
This is just one example in 
which 
genetic 
modification 
has worked towards fixing 
an environmental issue. In 
fact, many environmentalists 
see 
genetic 
modification 
as 
an 
answer 
to 
various 
environmental 
issues, 
including feeding a burgeoning 
human 
population 
on 
less 
land and helping endangered 
species 
adapt 
to 
climate 
change. 

While 
many 

environmentalists 
see 
the 
process of genetic modification 
as a sort of Frankenstein-
esque process, others support 
its use. Even so, like thousands 
of Ian Malcolms, many have 
spoken out against the practice 
of 
genetic 
modification, 
warranting 
their 
fears 
by 
using information unfounded 
in and often disproven by 
modern science. 
Genetic 
modification 
of 
organisms has actually been 
the norm for decades in the 
agricultural industry due to 
its wide variety of benefits. 
Genetically 
modified 
food 
sources result in a higher 
yield, reducing deforestation 
in the process, and often 
requiring 
less 
pesticides 
than organic crops. Even the 
great Bill Nye, once a critic 
of genetic modification, has 
come to endorse its use, saying 
on 
Neil 
deGrasse 
Tyson’s 
podcast, 
“StarTalk,” 
that 
“genetically 
modified 
food 
has no effect on us.” Genetic 
modification is not without its 
flaws, however. It contributes 
to the worldwide loss in crop 
diversity and the corporate 
domination 
of 
the 
world’s 
food supply, with 53 percent 
of the world’s food supply 
being owned by just three 
companies. 
Whether 
the 
moral 
dilemmas 
outweigh 
the 
benefits has yet to be proven. 
The FDA has declared the 
practice safe and the nation 
must start allowing facts to 
drive the discussions around 
genetic modification rather 
than dystopian presumptions. 
So if you go out there and 
eat a beautiful, genetically 
modified apple that shines so 
bright it burns your eyes, or an 
orange the size of a fat baby, 
you might just be saving the 
world.

Finding love? There’s an app for that

RILEY DEHR | COLUMN

“

So...how 
did 
you 
two 
meet?” was a question I 
dreaded hearing, and one 
I typically answered with half-
truths. Sometimes I would say we 
met at the coffee shop where we 
had our first official date. Other 
times I would respond vaguely 
with the city where we’d met and 
hope for no further questions. 
Occasionally I would claim it was 
a rogue LinkedIn message that 
brought us together. Every one 
of these partial truths concealed 
the honest beginning of our 
relationship, because we met in a 
way I was convinced no great love 
story could possibly begin. We 
met online.
More specifically, we met on 
a dating app, one making the 
seemingly counterintuitive claim 
that it’s “designed to be deleted.” 
While Hinge has been around 
for about as long as Tinder has, 
its rise in popularity has been 
more recent. Marketing itself as a 
dating app for people who want to 
get off dating apps, it differs from 
many of its dating app siblings 
both 
in 
profile 
appearance 
and 
liking 
mechanism. 
The 
app features answers to short 
prompts and personal interests 
alongside profile pictures, and 
“likes” are meant to be tailored to 
each profile instead of a recurrent 
right swipe. These choices do 
seem designed with relationships 
in mind, focusing on personality 
compatibility 
and 
customized 
first interactions rather than 
superficial attraction and copy-
and-paste icebreakers.
Still, it’s easy to be skeptical 
about the ability to form a true 
connection via Wi-Fi connection. 
Topping the App Store’s Lifestyle 
category chart, Tinder has played 
a significant role in the growth 
of online dating, which means it 
has a huge impact on how online 
dating is perceived. And whether 
through design or through user 
experience, Tinder has gained 
a reputation as a “hook-up” app, 
which has impacted the wider 
perception of online dating – to 
many, its utility is limited to short-
term partnerships and casual 
flings. This reputation, along with 
an assortment of other reasons, 

stigmatizes meeting online as 
unnatural and even desperate. 
But as online dating becomes 
more and more prevalent, it’s 
important to question the reason 
for the swiping game shame and 
change attitudes about starting a 
relationship online.
Part of the stigma surrounding 
meeting online may come from 
the remnants of the internet’s 
beginnings. From the Craigslist 
Killer to Chris Hansen’s “To 
Catch a Predator,” the media’s 
portrayal of those seeking a 
digital connection was defined by 
outsiders and people with ulterior 
motives, and stranger danger 

was expanded to the entire web. 
However, with the expansion of 
social media, it’s much easier to 
verify a Tinder match’s identity. 
By 
following 
a 
few 
simple 
guidelines, online dating can be 
a perfectly safe way of meeting 
someone. To many people, it can 
feel even safer than traditional 
dating. Getting to know someone 
from a distance presents a unique 
relationship phase that removes 
the pressure and immediacy of 
face-to-face interaction. It can 
make it easier to notice red flags 
and judge a situation rationally. 
In 
addition, 
bringing 
the 
relationship offline for the first 
time can be carefully planned 
so both parties feel safe and in 
control. Of course, we should still 
be diligent about letting trusted 
sources know about our plans for 
the first time we meet someone 
offline. But this isn’t a caution 
unique to online dating; it is the 
same as letting a friend know 
who we are leaving a party with 
or alerting a parent about an early 
morning run at the Arb. It is a 
fairly standard measure we take 

in many parts of our lives, not 
just for Bumble dates.
Yet for many, the hesitation 
surrounding dating apps isn’t 
about fear; it’s about following 
the rules. Isn’t using a dating 
app sort of cheating? Winning 
a game by cheating isn’t really 
winning at all. Love is meant 
to 
happen 
spontaneously, 
not 
through 
swipes, 
and 
every great love story begins 
with some sort of meet-cute. 
According to Insider senior 
reporter Lindsay Dodgson, the 
convenience provided by dating 
apps might even be destroying 
love. 
But 
classifying 
dating 
apps as the easy way out leads 
to questions about many of the 
more traditional, “valid” ways 
to potentially meet significant 
others. For some, going out 
to parties, bars and clubs is 
almost exclusively about finding 
a match. People join certain 
activities and enroll in certain 
courses in hopes of capturing 
a certain type of person. A true 
connection is expected to be 
unexpected, but in reality, many 
people are actively looking to 
date to a certain extent, whether 
through swiping, socializing or 
their sociology course. Dating 
online 
doesn’t 
remove 
the 
possibility of spontaneity, either. 
What could be more unexpected 
than 
an 
algorithm 
creating 
an opportunity for a perfect 
match out of thousands or even 
millions of possible pairings? A 
well-crafted first message can 
certainly make for a wonderful 
meet-cute story. 
Modern 
technology 
has 
significantly changed how we 
do 
pretty 
much 
everything, 
including 
communicating, 
applying to college, ordering a cab 
and, yes, dating. Embracing these 
changes breaks down stigmas 
and creates a society more open 
to non-traditional ways of finding 
the one. Plus, couples with online 
origins will no longer need to 
sweat the question, “So... how 
did you two meet?” That might 
actually be a pretty cute story.

Homecoming: sharing our love for Lady Ann and U-M

Since my freshman year, I have been 
working in a biochemistry lab on the 
Medical Campus. It was a job I procured 
out of peer, advisor and personal pressure 
to do research in any way possible after a 
significant academic pivot from pre-law 
to pre-med during my first semester.
After doing away with math and 
science, disavowing their application or 
importance in my vastly superior world 
of law, I had not taken a STEM class 
since my junior year of high school and 
successfully snuck around the reaches 
of calculus and A.P. physics. Gone were 
the days of numbers and lab partners and 
calculators.
However, after a less-than-affirming 
experience interning in a district court 
and an exhilarating experience in an 
emergency room, I realized that I was in 
fact not going to be a lawyer, and I was 
really meant to be a doctor. Back to the 
drawing board, I found that I would need 
the numbers and the lab partners and the 
calculators.
Void of any university-level scientific 
knowledge, I interviewed for a position 
doing biochemical research before I had 
even enrolled in general chemistry. 
I was taken on as a volunteer, washing 
dishes and organizing boxes, trying to get 
some sort of grasp on what was going on 
by watching the post-docs do their work. 
I was blown away at their experiments, 
bewildered by the concept of effectively 
growing yeast cells with different 
fluorescent 
properties. 
It 
seemed 
superhuman — I couldn’t understand it. 
Everything went over my head, and I was 
afraid that it was too late to make such a 
monumental shift to pre-med.
Nevertheless, I stuck with it, as I 
worked through an overloaded schedule 
of introductory chemistry, biology and 
calculus. I tried to understand more 
from the lab, but it was still remarkably 
challenging. The head of the lab had to 

sit through my floundering attempts at 
explaining what I thought was going on.
I stayed in Ann Arbor over my first 
summer 
to 
continue 
my 
catch-up 
work, and I continued working in the 
laboratory. I was officially hired to 
continue my work washing dishes and 
organizing boxes, but now I could also 
make a couple solutions. I knew about 
molarity, more or less, and could put 
together a sodium chloride solution. 
I figured out how to use an autoclave 
and how to make synthetic media for 
bacterial growth, though I still didn’t 
know how the cells could just grow like 
that.
Sophomore year came around and I 
was still working at the lab as I worked 
at organic chemistry and neuroscience 
courses. I began to understand more 
about how biological molecules worked, 
why carbon is so important, how cells 
can talk to one another and why bacteria 
can just grow like that. With the help of 
patient mentors, I began to piece together 
an enormous scientific puzzle with an 
innumerable number of puzzle pieces. 
My labwork became a constant parallel 
to my coursework, a benchmark to check 
my understanding and fill in gaps.
Over the past summer, I learned 
how to grow yeast cells with different 
fluorescent properties and how those 
properties can be evaluated. The work 
that once seemed superhuman now 
made sense. It was tactile, and I could do 
it myself.
Now, as a junior returning to the 
lab this semester, I continue to have 
revelations of the biochemistry that 
once confounded me. I continue to piece 
together the enormous scientific puzzle, 
though there is still a great deal to learn 
and a great deal to be confounded by. 
Still, reflecting on my homecoming to the 
laboratory each semester, I see what a 
remarkable resource it has been over the 
past three years — not only for learning 
biochemistry and laboratory techniques, 
but also because I can see my intellectual 
growth in subjects of study that I had 
once feared were beyond my reach.

Without a doubt, what I look 
forward to the most while being 
back in Lady Ann are game days. 
Yes, it’s great to see all my friends 
again. Yes, I love my rigorous 
training curriculum even in my 
senior year. Yes, the traffic on Huron 
is as thrilling as ever. But, game days 
as a student are just magical. 
Our section — filled with Musical 
Theater majors — on game days 
is without a doubt my favorite. 
Reliving those vibrant moments 
of school spirit as everyone comes 
together 
before 
the 
crushing 
atmosphere of winter isolation is a 
sensation that I am convinced could 
not be replicated anywhere else. 
Of course, there’s the game day 
garb. It always impresses me how 
creative people get with their game 
day outfits. I try to be as glam as 
humanly possible. I wear costume 

diamond drop earrings with a 
bright yellow $20 fur coat. I top it off 
with a bucket hat. The rest depends 
on the temperature. 
The actual victor of the game 
is rarely the point of game days. 
My friends and I subscribe to the 
notion of the journey being more 
important than the destination. 
This is really only false when we are 
playing against Michigan State or 
Ohio State. In these situations, the 
output is crucial to school morale. 
I love game days. The happiest 
I’ve been here is on game days. The 
feeling of being a part of something 
so big, joined together by one 
common goal, is just downright 
cool. Before I came to Michigan, 
people told me that everyone up 
here would brainwash me into 
thinking that we had the greatest 
school in the world. They were 
completely right. We do have the 
greatest school in the world. I’d 
love for someone to try and tell me 
otherwise.

Ann Arbor is in the same state you left it 
in — 68 degrees, sunny, students on lawns 
and streets with frisbees and chairs. Red 
Light Rotisserie got a new sign, but Campus 
Corner remains intact. State Street still hosts 
Noodles & Co., The Getup Vintage and its 
beloved theater. The Diag got some new 
stones.
But things are also very different. 
No matter what, everyone tries during 
homecoming to reestablish themselves 
on campus (and demonstrate what good 
summer’s done for them). This might 
manifest in initiating a conversation you 
wouldn’t have had last year, going up to that 
professor you’ve gauged as cool after class or 
telling that voice in your head that doesn’t 

want booze at 10 in the morning “no.” 
From an individualistic perspective, 
there are incentives to plant new roots, but 
there’s also just a general exuberance — a 
zeitgeist really — that is Welcome Week at 
the University. With everyone back in town 
and no class, people feed off each other’s 
energy and openness like no other time of 
the year. 
There are the nights in with those you 
expect to get closest to — the new roommates. 
Friends of friends you meet on a night out get 
a warm hug. Strangers shout at you from 
cars and approach you on streets, and you 
reciprocate their forwardness. There are, 
of course, the rituals — Festifall, football, 
all-college BBQs. These are decades-old 
traditions that are all intended to get the big 
machine up and running again.
It’s unclear where the dividing line is 
between these opening weeks and the rest 

of the year, but you eventually feel when 
they’re gone. For me, their departure is 
signalled by my first late night spent in the 
studio doing architecture work. When these 
weeks’ charisma fades, you’re suddenly 
left in a world only slightly different than 
semesters past: an alternate reality where 
summer, now in the past, is the only thing 
that’s caused this environment and people 
you’ve been acquainted with for years now 
to feel new. 
Sure, we’re left by circumstance in 
new groups, but homecoming is really 
a reintroduction to whatever life you’ve 
started here in years prior. We’re the same 
people as we were in the summer, but a 
change of location and people as such is 
certain to affect our ego. 
As homecoming and reassimilation 
comes to a close in Ann Arbor, where does it 
leave you?

COMMUNITY CULTURE SPECIAL EDITION

Games days: the 
perfect welcome

I remember the first time I went home to 
New Jersey for Thanksgiving freshman year. I 
was so young, so breathless and I hadn’t ever 
fallen in love — with a person, any midwestern 
city or myself. If you told that baby faced 
18-year-old whose dorm walls were covered in 
light pink decorations what would become of 
the next three years, she would first sob, and 
then she would kiss your hands. I remember 
accidentally referencing going back to school 
as “going home” that first Thanksgiving, which 
either put a dagger or planted a bed of flowers 
in my mother’s chest — maybe a bit of both. But 
that’s just it — it is home. Perhaps not so much 
in address or birthright, but in sentiment. 
Freshman year was the first time I stepped 
foot into 420 Maynard St and walked into 
the newsroom of the Daily, a place that will 
forever hold my heart in its hands. It’s the early 
evening I met my redheaded best friend, whom 
I’ve never wanted to experience life or walk 
into Panchero’s without ever since. It’s the year 
I spent sitting across from my roommate on 

pink and gold coordinated bed sheets recalling 
tedium of our first classes and the terror 
of placing trust in the hands of people you 
only just met. At once, three years in my past 
feels simultaneously like yesterday and one 
thousand years ago. 
Three years later, I arrived here in August 

for a fourth and final time. As we pulled off the 
exit for Ann Arbor, my best friend and I held 
hands in the car and fought tears. We were 
home again, one last time. 
Life and Michigan circle around us in 
fascinating ways. We realize that nothing, not 
even a campus this large, is really so gigantic. 
Everything gets smaller. We’ll know someone’s 

hands and then we’ll unlearn them. We’ll walk 
into a class to learn about stats, but walk away 
learning about life. We learn that luck can be 
very large and very small. We fall into things 
for a reason — classes, mass meetings, people, 
coffee dates. We fall out of things for very 
similar reasons. The gift of Michigan is that 
every closed door bears something new right 
behind the next, right around the corner. This 
campus has broken my heart twice, afforded 
me the ability to travel to South Africa to study 
theatre, fractured and mended me. It has told 
me that my purpose on this earth is to be a 
writer; it has given me opportunities and late-
night pizza.
This place, for me, is home. It is traveling 
across the world and meeting a Michigan 
graduate at a wine tasting, it is the “Go Blue!” 
we will utter to strangers for eternity, it is 
8 a.m. lectures in ten degree weather, it is 
the memories of our decrepit senior houses, 
Greenwood Avenue, flights to DTW and 
strangers who became soulmates. And because 
home can be a sentiment, an emotion, a tickle in 
your chest as you walk down familiar streets — 
we’ll always have this shimmering zip code to 
come back to, for forever.

Reflections on a final homecoming:
A senior’s last first embrace of A2

A very Sussman homecoming

Homecoming is a unique situation — a 
strange amalgamation of emotions that 
are unrivaled, in my opinion, by any other 
experience I’ve had in college.
Homecoming, at least in the beginning 
stages, is boring, overwhelming and 
sometimes slightly bittersweet. It means 
that the summer is over, that the time for 
experimenting with jobs and side projects 
is over. It means reconnecting with friends 
that I haven’t seen in months, both people 
that I’ve tried to keep in touch with and 
people that I haven’t bothered to. 
It means running into people around 
campus that I haven’t thought about since 
freshman year. It means hearing about 
hundreds of summer jobs and trying to 
act interested in the inevitable banality of 
unpaid internships. 
Homecoming can also be quite exciting. 

It’s an opportunity to meet new people and 
try new things. It involves mass meetings 
and hoards of Google calendar events. It 
involves constant internal deliberation: 
Could I fit that club in my schedule? If I 
tried that activity would it ruin these other 
activities? Would I be okay dropping this 
activity in favor of that activity?
Almost by default, this becomes an 
annual referendum on my career goals. 
I’m forced to consider whether my classes 
match my career goals and whether my 
extracurricular activities provide the 
much needed supplements in today’s 
increasingly 
competitive 
job 
market. 
I’m forced to question whether my 
assumptions from last year are still true in 
this regard.
And once I begin to develop a regular 
schedule, 
homecoming 
can 
become 
disorienting. It forces me to rediscover the 
group of friends that I’ll end up spending 
the majority of my time with outside 
of class. Despite what I may think, I’ve 

changed over the summer. My friends 
have changed over the summer. Almost 
inevitably, I’ll be closer to some people than 
I was last year and further from others.
But as homecoming winds down, as I 
overcome my mid-college crisis and settle 
into a normal routine, the thing that stands 
out most in my mind is the excitement 
in the air all around Ann Arbor. It’s the 
excitement of over 44,000 students coming 
together again after four months apart. 
It’s 
something 
that 
I’ve 
never 
experienced before and I’ll probably 
never experience again: a town filled with 
44,000 people just like me, with 44,000 
people around my age, all of whom live in 
the same town for the same reason. 
I can’t think of anything more exciting 
than that. And as the many emotions of 
homecoming recede into the distance, 
it is this sense of opportunity that sticks 
with me — that feeling of returning to and 
rejoining a community that I am meant to 
be in. It’s the feeling of coming home.

Danny Brown’s last album, 
Atrocity Exhibition, was widely 
acclaimed and viewed by many to 
be one of the best projects of 2016. 
To follow up such a successful 
project can be a challenge, but, 
luckily for us, Danny Brown 
seems more than ready for the 
daunting task at hand. “Dirty 
Laundry,” the first single off of 
his recently-announced project, 
uknowhatimsayin¿, is a brazen, 
colorful statement of intent, 
letting everyone know that he’s 
got more to say.
Much like Danny Brown’s 
signature vocal style, the beat 
(courtesy of Q-Tip) is vivid, 
hallucinatory and cartoonish. 
These are not the shadowy, 
vintage cartoon images that are 
suffused throughout much of 
hip-hop 
(e.g. 
Madvillainy, 
“Cartoons and Cereal”), but more 
like the vibrant, acid-drenched 
animation found on Adult Swim. 
Much like the experimental 
cartoon 
programming 
block, 
Danny Brown is not afraid of 
vulgarity, and his record of 
humorous sexual explicity is 
continued on “Dirty Laundry”: 
Lines like “Once got a ho, ain’t 
had money for the room / So we 
did the humpty hump in a Burger 
King bathroom / Lowkey kept it 
undercover / The way she slurp 

slurp, she’s the quicker picker-
upper” make the double entendre 
of the title all too clear (even if 
the “quicker picker-upper” line 
is actually the tagline for Bounty 
paper towels). 
Most 
importantly, 
Danny 
Brown 
sounds 
fearless 
and 
confident in his new direction. 
“Dirty Laundry” preserves the 
bizarreness 
and 
acerbic 
wit 
that makes him special without 
stagnating, is brimming with 
creativity and is an auspicious 
sign of things to come.

Danny Brown has more to say 
 on new single ‘Dirty Laundry’

SINGLE REVIEW

I don’t think I found out about 
online shopping until I was 11 or 12. I 
surfed the Internet before then, sure. 
I may have found the model bios on 
Abercrombie & Fitch and read up 
on how Nathan likes to spend his 
summers sailing off the coast of his 
family’s vacation home in Nantucket. 
I studied how he wore his jeans low, 
and how he didn’t seem to be worried 
about their grave potential of falling 
off at any moment in the pictures he 
posed for. I owned several pairs and 
approximated his look to the best of 
my ability —which, for me, somehow 
meant layered t-shirts in a variety 
of colors, ripping apart my carefully 
distressed denim to display a tasteful 
peep of thigh, and a propensity to 
suck in my cheeks and push out my 
lips that plagues me to this very day. 
I may have spent some long nights 
having long, separate conversations 
—on my phone and through my newly 
minted email (Runningaddict97@
comcast.net because I wanted to 
seem sporty), at the same time and 
with the same person. Hunter was 
funny, bubbly and just cruel enough 
to me that I felt comfortable coming 
back to him every night to bond over 
our mutual love of … corn dogs? I 
don’t remember exactly what we 
talked about, but I remember that he 
ate corn dogs and twinkies every day, 
and that I fantasized about shacking 
up with him as we prepared for the 
nuclear winter. He looked like a 
literal fox with fine, almost platinum 
blonde hair. I knew he secretly hated 
me, and I was enamored to the point 
where I could only bear to try and 
connect with him from the safety 
afforded to me behind my desktop 
computer screen.
We would play soccer and football 
together, but I only really knew how 
to run fast. I thought that if I ran laps 

around the scrum of players in the 
middle of the field — and I harnessed 
the cool masculinity that Nathan 
wielded so easily with my ripped 

jeans — then I would finally be 
picked to be on his team. I thought if 
I saved up enough of my allowance, I 
could buy myself into this boys’ club 
that was always just out of reach. 
Hunter could play sports, and I just 
wanted to look the part.
Themes 
were 
very 
important 
to me growing up, whether that 
was the — shall we say ill-fated — 
PBTeen, 
tiki-inspired 
confection 
that became of my bedroom or the 
worlds that I could build for myself 
with its contents. A model car or 
a cutout from a magazine were 
one way tickets to a fully realized 
fantasy — complete with houses 
by the beach, jobs, 401ks, spouses 
across 
a 
spectrum 
of 
genders, 
precarious social networks that had 
to be traversed in Machiavellian 
fashion and clothes. The clothes 
I got to wear! My self expression 
was completely uninhibited in this 
fantastical, if not slightly vacuous 
space of mine, and the only kernel 
that could be salvaged from my 
reverie was what I wore to school 
each day.
It turns out that I was the last 
person to get in on the ground floor 
of my sexual deviance. Rumors 
about my friendship with Dorothy 
began 
to 
circulate 
around 
the 
same time I started exhibiting 
that subtle flash of leg. The stress 
they brought, combined with the 
absurd popularity contest that was 
my elementary school experience, 
seemed to color what I viewed as an 
escape from daily life. My fantasies 
weren’t absent of the creatures that 
created the need for them, I was just 
powerful enough to cast them off 
into vague opportunities for conflict 
in which I could be successful and 
clothes were my sword.
It 
makes 
perfect 
sense 
that 
everything changed for me when I 
found out that Saks had a website. 
It took very little time for dancing 
around in a towel dress and my 
mom’s open-toe pumps to turn into 
canary Zac Posen taffeta and a pair of 
cork-soled red bottoms. Pressures to 
conjure up a wife and focus on what 
she would wear more than myself 
were vanquished, and all of a sudden 
I got to be Isabella. Or Cheryl. Or 
whoever. I got to be Sam, too — I 
didn’t have to choose. Every ideal 
that I would happily bridge chasms 
to satisfy in my mental landscape, 
be it my relationship to gender and 
sexuality or all of the attributes 
entailing that easy masculinity I 
so valued, almost instantaneously 
collapsed 
upon 
entry 
into 
the 
consumer marketplace. 
My first forays into an empowered 
sense of femininity, one that skulked 
in and out of the Park Avenue 
penthouse she found on Christie’s 
and wasn’t afraid to indulge in long, 
long stares at the all-nude Dolce & 
Gabbana Menswear ads of the time 
— into queerness, really, happened 
at the same time I started to realize 

what class was. And that the things I 
feel drawn to have a nasty tendency 
to cost lots and lots of money. 
Dressing myself not only reached 
new 
dimensions 
of 
aspiration, 
but became a way for me to shield 
myself from a community that was 
hostile towards difference. As a 
very nervous young boy preparing 

to go down a road that spoke of 
vulnerabilities having yet to reveal 
themselves, a facade that read as 
impenetrable to others seemed like a 
sensible way to go. 
This of course, is not a love letter 
to consumerism, or a failure to 
acknowledge that part of what I 
aspired to had very much to do with 
surviving (even selfishly thriving) 
in a system that afforded me some 
privileges and not others. Rather, 
I’m saying that there are great 
truths that lie in fantasy, in what we 
envision ourselves to be, and how we 
communicate that to others. Clothes, 
in choosing them and throwing 
them on our back, can give us the 
keys to explore parts of ourselves 
that we’re not yet fully conscious 
of. They let us create characters, 
fabricate whole worlds, and try to 
sell them as best we can. They can 
be armor. They have the power to 
unite and divide, and as with all 
modes of expression that lie at the 
intersection of history, culture and 
status, finding the self starts with 
what we can only dream of. Fashion, 
style and art are too often discussed 
as musings of the mind — born of, 
but ultimately detached from, the 
matrices of power from which we all 
operate. So if you’ll humor me, from 
my velveteen dreams to yours, I’d 
like to start a conversation.

Who gets to tell the shameful stories of a 
nation’s past? Imagine a negotiating table, 
but for collective memory. Whom should 
we see seated, and where? Historically, 
the victors have taken a disproportionate 
number of seats, controlling the historical 
record apparently among the spoils of war. 
In more recent decades, marginalized and 
oppressed people have fought their way into 
the negotiations, staking their claim in the 
story of nations that are equal parts theirs. 
Regardless, the questions of who gets a seat 
at the negotiating table, and who sits where, 
are always in flux.
Co-directors Nanfu Wang (“Hooligan 
Sparrow”) and Jialing Zhang’s (“Complicit”) 
handling of these questions will surprise, 
especially given their subject matter: In their 
documentary feature “One Child Nation,” 
the two native Chinese women filmmakers 
take on the history and present-day 
repercussions of China’s one-child policy. As 
the name implies, this legal measure limited 
families in China to having one child; what 
isn’t as readily discernible are the great, 
human-rights-out-the-window lengths the 
country went to in order to enforce it. 
I expect many of you will go into the 
film awaiting victims’ accounts of what the 
policy stripped from them, much like I did. 

But Wang and Zhang chose to tell the story a 
different way, incorporating the perspectives 
of people with varying levels of complicity in 
the policy’s brutal enforcement. The result 
is a film that renegotiates not only China’s 
memory of this policy gone horribly wrong, 
but the entire notion of historical memory 
along with it.
One of the first subjects, Wang, the 
conductor of on-screen interviews and 
director whose presence is most apparent 
throughout, talks to is a village official from 
the rural community she grew up in. While 
we saw Wang’s own mother and will see 
many others speak in the same anticipatory, 
defensive way, when asked about how they 
responded to the policy, this man’s responses 
were punctuated by long pauses between 
confessions of his role in the cruelty. When 
he describes the forced sterilizations he 
witnessed, he calls them “fucked up,” 
though he does not claim that he tried to 
disrupt them. At the end of this sequence, 
while the camera stays fixed on the official 

and his neighbors, we hear Wang think 
out loud about whether to use the village 
official’s connections to find women who 
lost their children in the enforcement of the 
policy. Another off-screen voice challenges 
the thought of putting them on camera and 
asking them to re-experience their trauma.
In the film that ensues, Wang and Zhang 
seem to heed this warning. We see Wang 
speak to a midwife who aborted children 
without the mother’s consent. She speaks 
with a family planning official, who justifies 
the policy as an act of putting national 
interest before personal discomfort. She 
speaks with researchers who try to track and 
reunite abandoned children with their birth 
families, with journalists who resisted the 
policy and its aftermath in their respective 
forms. What we do not hear are any pained 
accounts from forcibly sterilized women, 
from children sold to orphanages in the 
strictest days of the policy.
Wang and Zhang do not tap into this 
ethos, which seems so natural to a narrative 
that has numerous victims, but I think that 
was deliberate and wise. That might have 
been too much of what we expected to hear, 
might have matched this story’s frequency to 
that of most of the stories we hear, drowning 
in a cacophony of shameful histories and 
unimpressive resolutions. Instead, we have 
to wrestle with the complexity, if not futility, 
of allocating individual blame, as well as 
the perhaps more worthwhile question of 
reparation and collective healing.
That said, ambivalence surrounding 
enablement of the policy does not register 
throughout. 
For 
instance, 
whenever 
the directors had a child on camera, the 
emotional weight of the burden they 
inherit from their elders was not subdued 
but patiently allowed to sit, uneasily, 
unresolved on our minds and hearts. To 
that end, the most heartrending scene is 
easily the interview with a twin, living in 
China, whose sister was taken away. When 
the pre-teen girl lists off what she wants for 
her sister — a loving set of adoptive parents 
in America, where her twin was found to 
have ended up — she gets sidetracked with 
what she would want, were they to reunite 
someday. They would have snowball fights 
in the winter, wear matching clothes and her 
tearful, thorough list goes on. In this young 
girl’s desperate fantasy, we watch it unfold: 
the outstanding loss, the open wound that is 
neither shrinking nor scabbing, as time goes 
by and steps toward healing are neglected.
By speaking to unexpected figures in 
the history of this policy and soliciting 
otherwise unheard of accounts, Wang and 
Zhang blurred the supposed line between 
victim and perpetrator, between innocent 
and guilty. Isn’t that how it should be? Isn’t 
history too complex to arrange into simple 
categories of good and evil? If anything, 
I hope “One Child Nation” might inspire 
others to tackle shameful histories in an 
equally nuanced light. There is such a thing 
as accountability, as taking responsibility for 
the wrong you did. Guilt is sitting with that, 
allowing it to fester, when the only way to 
truly take responsibility is to work together 
for reparation and positive change.

Jess Speight earns scholarship

Just before the start of fall camp, 
Jess Speight was at dinner with his 
dad when he missed a call from Jim 
Harbaugh.
He spent the next hour nervous, 
mind scrambling, wondering what 
the news could possibly be.
Then, Harbaugh called back. 
He wanted the junior to switch 
to defensive line. After losing so 
many linemen in the offseason, 
the Michigan football team was 
dangerously 
shallow 
at 
nose 
tackle and three-technique, and 
Harbaugh thought Speight would 
be better utilized there rather than 
as the third-string center.
Speight was a little apprehensive 
when he first heard the news. He 
came in as a preferred walk-on and 
dedicated two years to offensive 
line, only to suddenly switch — a 
week before fall camp, no less. 
Speight played both lines in high 
school, but preferred offense then 
and focused his training there. But 
after calling his family, including 
his older brother, former Michigan 
quarterback Wilton Speight, to tell 
them the news, his nerves began to 
melt into excitement.

“(I was) confused what to 
think,” Speight said. “I didn’t know 
if I had just been wasting time 
playing offensive line. (Wilton) was 
immediately ecstatic, enthusiastic, 
saying that this might be one of 
the best moves that I’ve ever made 
while I played football.”
So Speight decided to embrace 
his new position. He changed his 
mindset to attack mode, wanting 
to run through someone on every 
play, trying to develop as fast as he 
could to make up for lost time.
At center, Speight had to think 
a lot, and it slowed him down 
sometimes. Now, at defensive line, 
he doesn’t have to think — just 
attack. He’s become close with 
defensive line coach Shaun Nua, 
who pushes him without being 
overbearing. And then, he began to 
love his new position.
“Everybody knows it was a little 
bit of an awkward position just 
because I’ve already been here two 
years and putting a good bit of time 
into offensive line,” Speight said. 
“The way Harbaugh presented it 
was that they’re just going to try 
me at D-line and I was probably a 
week in and realized that I really 
liked it, really had a passion for it. 
So I just tried to develop as quickly 

as I could, try to make up for two 
years that I lost playing O-line.”
The Monday after the Middle 
Tennessee 
game, 
Harbaugh 
gathered 
the 
team 
together 
and 
announced 
that 
Speight 
and 
junior 
offensive 
lineman 
Andrew Vastardis would receive 
scholarships. Speight had gotten 
into the game on special teams, 
making the moment even more 
special.
Speight and Vastardis had an 
idea scholarships were coming. 
Earlier, Harbaugh had made a list 
of who he was considering, and 
both players were on it. But still, it 
was a big moment, a culmination 
of the hard work that at first had 
seemed so pointless.
Speight estimated that scout 
team guys like him could do 500 
reps in practice just to get one rep 
in a game. But now, with some 
playing time and a scholarship, 
those reps he’s put in have finally 
begun to pay off.
“When he went to defense, it was 
sad to see him go,” Vastardis said. 
“But we gave him the opportunity 
to achieve all this. I think he’s 
really taken it and ran, and it’s been 
fun to watch. It’s been fun to play 
against him too, on different sides.”

Anthony gives depth at linebacker

The complexities of football 
don’t become easier defending 
against a triple-option.
Against Army last Saturday, 
Don 
Brown 
said 
Michigan 
called a blitz “every snap of 
the game.” Of course, it’s more 
complex than that — they only 
actually ran a blitz 18-20 times. 
Bridging the space between 
the initial call and what the 
Wolverines 
actually 
ended 
up doing falls to the middle 
linebacker.
Brown gave the example of 
Army coming out in a double 
slot formation. The middle 
linebacker’s job was to use the 
‘Horns up’ signal — Longhorn, 
in 
Michigan’s 
parlance 
— 
indicating 
the 
triple 
option, 
which 
starts 
with the same 
letter 
T 
as 
Texas. 
The 
alternative 
is 
just 
yelling 
“Blitz!” 
the 
result 
of 
which is self-
explanatory.
The example 
was small and understandable 
enough 
that 
Brown 
could 
explain 
it 
to 
a 
group 
of 
reporters — most of whom 
aren’t qualified to step onto a 
football field — in minutes. So 
imagine a whole book of them, 
then imagine a player getting 
that responsibility thrust on 
him midgame, and then you 
might 
understand 
Jordan 
Anthony’s predicament.
Anthony, 
a 
redshirt 
sophomore, had played in eight 
games at Michigan before last 
Saturday. In three of them, he 
played only special teams, and 
in the other five, he contributed 
in bite-sized increments, often 
at the end of blowouts. He’s 
never totaled a sack or a tackle 
for loss in college. Certainly, 
he had never played a half of 

football for the Wolverines in 
which he was on the field as 
much as Saturday. As soon as 
starting linebacker Josh Ross 
went out with a stinger, it was 
almost inevitable that Anthony 
would 
notch 
career highs in 
every 
category 
in which he put 
up a stat.
“He’s played 
about this much 
time 
for 
us 
since he’s been 
here,” 
Brown 
said, gesturing 
to indicate just 
how little time 
it was. “Now he’s going to take 
over.”
For Michigan’s defense, a 
unit that faced questions all 
offseason about losing Devin 
Bush in the middle, this was 
quietly as big a test as Ross 
taking over the 
position. In the 
past, it had the 
requisite depth 
to 
withstand 
injuries. Now?
Let 
Lavert 
Hill explain.
“Jordan 
Anthony came 
in, 
he 
just 
stepped up big 
time for Josh 
Ross,” the senior cornerback 
said. “He just came in, did what 
he had to do, just helped us get 

to win.”
The Black Knights scored 
14 points in the first half; they 
wouldn’t 
score 
again 
until 
overtime. Anthony made four 
tackles — as many as he did 
all of last season — and kept 
up with those calls. Michigan 
won, and the consternation this 
week is not about a defense that 
lost its best three players to the 
NFL, but an offense that came 
into this season as a presumed 
upgrade.
This is the kind of depth that 
Brown dreams of at any position. 
Ross is a year ahead of Anthony, 
having played his freshman 
year instead of redshirting. 
Through two games (with the 
obvious disclaimer for level 
of competition), he’s provided 
adequate replacement of Bush. 
When he went down, Anthony 
did the same for him, and did 
it against a team for which 
complication 
is 
inherent.
“And in the 
half of football 
— ‘How did he 
play?’ ” Brown 
said, incredulous 
at his own fake 
question. “Well 
all I know is the 
half of football 
he played, they 
scored 
zero 
points, so how do you think he 
played? 
“It’s amazing to me.”

A 
slight 
smell 
of 
sweat 
permeated the nearby offices of 
Yost Ice Arena.
A group of defensive players, 
straight from practice, had been 
ushered into a room. But no one 
cared about the discomfort of 
their noses. Their eyes and ears 
laid focused on a single person, 
breaking down a cip from the 
day’s practice.
Newly hired assistant coach 
Kris Mayotte was giving a 
lesson.
It did not take 
a discerning eye 
to 
tell 
where 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 
needed help.
Out 
of 
the 
60 
teams 
in 
the nation, the 
Wolverines 
ranked 
46th 
in 
penalty 
kills. 
And 
for 
goaltending 
save 
percentage, 
they ranked second-to-last in 
the nation. It was very clear 
what they needed to change to 
fix their struggles.
The original intent was to 
keep everything similar, amid 
concerns 
that 
overreacting 
would be detrimental to the 
team’s 
progress 
in 
buying 
into the current system. But 
former assistant coach Brian 
Wiseman’s abrupt move to the 
Edmonton Oilers 
forced Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson’s hand, 
and 
he 
made 
the 
necessary 
adjustments.
“Goaltending, 
save percentage 
59th out of 60 
teams 
in 
the 
country. 
That’s 
not 
gonna 
cut 
it. Penalty killing. We have to 
get better,” Pearson said. “So 
we’ve added Kris Mayotte from 
Providence who’s brought in 
some new ideas and given us a 
different perspective.”
Mayotte 
left 
the 
Friars, 

where he helped the team tie 
for sixth in the nation in penalty 
kill percentage and 14th in 
goaltender 
save 
percentage. 
His expertise lays in the two 
areas Michigan struggled with 
most, and when the Wolverines 
narrowed the search, his name 
headlined the shortlist.
 “A tremendous amount of 
people interested in the job,” 
Pearson said. “We just broke it 
down and looked at strengths 
and weaknesses of the program, 
on the ice, the coaching end of 
it, also the recruiting part of 
it. He just sort of came at the 
top of the list as 
far as adding a 
defensive 
guy 
and a goalie guy 
and a guy to run 
the PK and some 
areas where we 
really 
needed 
some help.”
A 
phone 
call 
later, 
and 
Mayotte 
let 
it 
sink in. He would 
be coaching for Michigan, where 
he was the de facto penalty kill 
coach, as well as assisting with 
goaltending 
coaching 
duties 
with 
volunteer 
coach 
Steve 
Shields. Upon accepting the job, 
he picked up the phone again in 
the proceeding days, this time to 
make calls to introduce himself 
to the players and his new 
system.
Mayotte’s belief about penalty 
killing systems are that they are, 
for the most part, 
all the same.
To him, what 
differentiates 
systems are the 
things 
people 
choose 
to 
emphasize.
“If you talk 
to 10 different 
coaches, 
what 
they emphasize 
when they teach 
this specific system is the subtle 
difference,” Mayotte said. “Some 
talk about pressure, first and 
foremost, some talk about stick 
positioning, first and foremost, 
some talk about, reading. 
“There’s a couple different 

systems, 
there’s 
high 
opt 
pressure, there’s a little bit more 
passive, where you can block 
low, a few more shots, and just 
sit and shot lanes and try and be 
inside. And then what you see 
in the NHL is what they call, a 
track down or triangle and one.”
The system Mayotte likes to 
teach, however, is none of those. 
What he prefers is a straight 
line, 
go 
press 
style. He believes 
the 
aggressive 
attitude 
on 
the 
penalty 
kill 
forces 
the 
opponents 
to 
have 
to 
make 
the 
plays 
and 
subsequently, 
the errors.
Evaluating his 
roster, he found 
the Wolverine players had two 
strengths: 
they 
were 
quick, 
and they were smart. And so 
his emphasis was on those two 
things. Make the read. Call the 
press. Be aggressive.
“One-go-all-go type things 

so that the pressure isn’t for 
naught,” Mayotte said. “(The 
team’s) 
taken 
advantage 
of 

(the speed and smartness), and 
hopefully forcing the power play 
to play a little faster than they’re 
comfortable playing. And then 
force mistakes that way.”
As for goaltenders, Mayotte 
believes in the exact opposite. 
There was no forcing anything 
with 
the 
netminder. 
He 
simply waits and 
listens.
“Even 
just 
from 
practices, 
I’ll start clicking 
video for them,” 
Mayotte 
said. 
“So 
that 
we 
can 
sit 
down 
and watch and 
kind of go over 
a couple of things, and have 
conversations and the big thing 
with the goalies, is you know, 
I’m not going to ask them to 
play my game, or they have to be 
comfortable.”
His focus with goaltenders 

is to hear them out. In his 
eyes, there are things to do, 
but overall, Hayden Lavigne 
and Strauss Mann are not bad 
goalies.
“Hayden backs up this team 
— they’re Frozen Four the 
year 
before,” 
Mayotte 
said. 
“And Strauss, you know, won a 
championship, and he really had 
a good junior career.”
So Mayotte’s 
approach with 
them 
was 
simply 
to 
let 
them 
hit 
the 
reset 
button 
and talk them 
through 
the 
bad times. Stop 
a puck and shut 
out a game, and 
they get a lot of 
confidence. Let 
in a breakaway or a backdoor 
goal, and suddenly that affects 
them and the game slips away.
“You go out and you have a bad 
game and you give up five, it’s 
how do you respond,” Mayotte 
said. “And I think that’s our goal 

is just, be consistent.”
And one of the methods to 
consistency is talk through the 
tough streaks.
“You talk only all the time. 
And 
sometimes 
that’s 
just 
what goalies like to do is talk 
goalie. They just want someone 
that they can talk to about 
their situation and have an 
understanding because it is 
ultimately better 
or worse, it is a 
different position. 
The 
other 
five 
guys 
are 
doing 
something playing 
a 
completely 
different 
game 
than the goalie 
is 
playing. 
And 
sometimes 
they 
just need to vent 
and 
sometimes 
they just need someone to 
understand 
what 
the 
heck 
they’re talking about.”
Waving the players in to 
talk, Mayotte opens the door 
to his office, ushering in a new 
approach with his tenure.

University of Michigan Law School, 1225 Jeffries Hall

4:10–5:30 p.m.

A CONVERSATION WITH 
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE 
JUSTIN AMASH

On Friday night, a similar roar of 
applause to the one that filled Temple’s 
McGonigle Hall in April 1970 bounced 
off the walls in Ann Arbor’s Glick 
Ballroom.
A room full of people crowded 
around nine round tables overlooking 
the golf course along East Stadium 
Boulevard, eyes glued to the projector 
screen. On it, the faintly-colored film 
from the day that forever solidified the 
1970 Michigan men’s gymnastics team’s 
place in history rolled. Nearly half a 
century later, players from that national 
championship team still recall April 4, 
1970 well.
Over 18 months 
of planning went 
into the reunion, 
largely facilitated by 
a committee of four 
team members — 
Ron Rapper, Murray 
Plotkin, Ray Gura and 
Ed Howard.
When the idea of 
a reunion was first 
floated, the committee 
estimated about 30 
people would come. 
The team itself 
included 27 lettermen, 
of which two have 
passed away. Just two 
still live in Michigan, 
while others have 
settled as far away 
as Colorado, Florida and Arizona. The 
proposition of every living teammate 
making the trip felt far-fetched at first, 
but after the committee put out a feeler, 
it became reality quickly.
Eighteen months later, 85 people 
packed the Glick Ballroom to celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the team’s 
national championship. Some former 
players brought up to three generations 
of family to the dinner, while others 
traveled alone or with a spouse. 
Championship banners draped from the 
windows and the championship trophy 
sat on a table adjacent to the door as 
guests walked in.
Since 1969, the Michigan men’s 
gymnastics program is responsible 
for seven of the university’s 15 team 
national championships. Following 

the 1970 title, it took three decades for 
the program to hoist the trophy again. 
But the 1970 team’s impact on the 
perception surrounding the sport on 
campus goes far beyond a slab of iron 
with a championship inscription.
“Makes one feel as if we’ve come of 
age and are considered as one of the 
major sports on our campus,” coach 
Newt Loken wrote in his annual team 
newsletter that summer. “You men 
have elevated the sport of gymnastics 
to (what) some have declared ‘a 
fantastically beautiful sport.’ ”
***
More often than not, the 1970 
national championship felt out of 
Michigan’s reach. Eight teams qualified 
for the two-day preliminary qualifiers 
in Philadelphia, 
with the top three 
advancing to the 
finals the following 
day.
The Wolverines 
found themselves 
in fourth place 
at the close of 
the afternoon 
session. With their 
season on the line, 
they surged past 
Southern Illinois 
and Temple to 
clinch a spot in the 
next day’s field.
Just over 
24 hours later, 
Michigan needed 
more than a surge. 
It needed a miracle. 
With every routine in the books besides 
one, the Wolverines trailed Iowa State, 
the heavy favorite, by 9.3 points — a 
“lofty score” at the time, according to 
Rapper. Silence fell over McGonigle 
Hall as Howard, the last man standing, 
stepped up to the horizontal bars. With 
the pressure of an entire season on his 
shoulders, Howard delivered a career-
best 9.4.
The national championship was 
decided by one-tenth of a point — the 
scoring difference of a 
slight arm flex, a three-
degree vertical error or 
an inadvertent slight step 
on a dismount. Howard 
put the perfect bowtie 
on a 12-0 season, forever 
cementing the team 

among Michigan’s all-time best.
The Wolverines’ narrow margin 
in the championship might’ve been 
thrilling, but it wasn’t an accurate 
portrayal of how badly Michigan beat 
teams during that era. Beginning in 
1968, the team won four consecutive 
Big Ten titles, posting a 28-0 dual meet 
record across a three-year period in 
the process. The Wolverines won those 
meets by an average of five points. 
That’s the equivalent of a 31-3 win in 
football and 10-1 score in baseball, 
according to Rapper.
***
Ironically enough, the reunion began 
with a lost ring.
When trampoline champion 
Goerge Huntzicker discovered his 
championship ring was missing two 
years ago, he phoned Rapper — the 
team’s captain — to ask how to get 
a new one. These types of rings are 
hard to come by, so Rapper thought it 
was worth it to reach out to the whole 
team to see if other players lost their 
rings too. The wheels began turning 
in his head and, soon enough, the idea 
snowballed.
A long-overdue reunion was in order. 
Using the event as an opportunity to 
issue redesigned rings to the team was 
the perfect reason to bring everyone to 
the Ann Arbor. But the face of the man 
responsible for building the team was 
missing, as Loken passed away in 2011 
at the age of 92.
“Winning a championship is the 
pinnacle of college athletics,” Rapper 
said. “And for this championship, credit 
must go to our coach, Newt Loken. 
… He emphasized the importance of 
hitting your routine and instilled in us 
the pride of representing Michigan in 
the sport of gymnastics. It was Newt 
who engineered our victory. In what is 
traditionally an individually-focused 
sport, this team victory was very 
special.”
Added Plotkin: “(Loken) knew how 
to make things happen. He knew how to 
say things in a way that made you want 
to stretch yourself.”

When Michigan granted varsity 
status to its men’s gymnastics team in 
1947, Loken was named the program’s 
first coach. From there, the program 
was off and running. As a 1941 national 
high bar and all-around champion at 
Minnesota, he had the perfect pedigree 
to shape and lead an elite program. 
He remained at the helm for 36 years, 
compiling a 250-72-1 career record 
while winning a pair of NCAA titles 
and overseeing 71 Big Ten individual 
event championships.
Plotkin graduated in 1972 but 
remained in Ann Arbor to complete his 
master’s degree. Loken, nearing the 
end of his career, made Plotkin his first 
assistant coach. To this day, he raves 
about how lucky he was to have the 

dual perspective of both playing and 
working for Loken.
Loken’s death in 2011 marked the 
end of an era in men’s gymnastics. Even 
after retiring from coaching, he didn’t 
miss a single home meet for 61 years. In 
fact, once Loken retired, his successor 
named an award for best individual 
performance at each home meet after 
him. Loken presented the award, a 
certificate which quickly became one 
of the program’s highest honors, until 
2010.
“(Loken) was 
unlike nearly 
every other coach 
who has reached 
legendary 
status in his or 

her sport,” wrote former Daily sports 
editor Colt Rosensweig, author of 
the biography “Newt: The Father of 
Michigan Men’s Gymnastics.” “Instead 
of barking orders like a drill sergeant, 
Newt resembled a kindly father. His 
unflagging optimism and constant 
encouragement — not to mention his 
excellent technical skills — motivated 
his gymnasts more than a good chewing 
out ever could.”
***
The program fell out of contention 
after Loken retired, posting eight 
straight losing seasons during the 
decade prior to current coach Kurt 
Golder’s hiring in 1997. While the 
Wolverines suffered through their 
winless 1996 season, Golder served as 
the top assistant at Iowa — a program 
trending in the opposite direction. With 
little ambition to become a head coach 
at the time, Golder was content.
That is, until Loken called him. The 
next day, Loken called again. And again. 
He wouldn’t take no for an answer.
Ultimately, Golder accepted the 
job — a testament to Loken and his 
legacy. It only took Golder three years 
to transform a winless team into a 
national champion. The program 
hasn’t looked back, winning three more 
national titles since.
***
As the guests dined on salads, 
roasted Yukon potatoes and pecan 
crusted chicken, Rapper approached 
the podium. Rapper’s grandson, an 
aspiring gymnast himself, was one of 
the 85 pairs of eyes on the front of the 
room. Loken’s children sat at the front 
table, while Plotkin’s grandchildren 
played with a ball in the back of the 
room.
Beyond the applause that 
accompanied Howard’s now-legendary 
9.4, three generations of admiration, 
chatter and pride brought an equal 
presence to the room. And the bond 
shared amongst the 1970 teammates 
proved to be as strong as ever.
“It’s great to get the band back 
together,” Rapper said. “There’s 
something to be said about the athletic 
bond that ties together members of an 
athletic team. The bond is particularly 
strong that brings together an NCAA 
championship team.”
Now, they have new rings to show 
for it.
