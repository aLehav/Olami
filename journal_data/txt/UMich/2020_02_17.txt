School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance junior Chloe Castro-
Santos was working at Sava’s, a 
popular Ann Arbor restaurant, in 
2018 when the head chef Gustavo 
Salazar 
Esquivel 
allegedly 
propositioned her for sex.
This was the summer after her 
freshman year at the University 
of Michigan, and he had just 
helped her during a particularly 
busy shift. She tried to thank 
him for his assistance.
“I was like, ‘Thank you so 
much for helping me today, really 
appreciate it.’ And he was like, ‘I 
helped you, so you help me.’ And 
he alluded to oral sex,” Castro-
Santos said in an interview with 
The Daily. “It traumatized me 
because I was at work. I’m just 
trying to make my rent and go 
home.”
On July 28, 2018, Castro-
Santos emailed a resignation 
letter to Sava’s management. 
She 
alleged 
that 
she 
had 
been 
repeatedly 
sexually 
harassed while working in the 
restaurant’s kitchen and that 
Sava’s management, including 
the 
restaurant’s 
owner 
and 
SavCo Hospitality CEO, Sava 
Farah, had failed to address this.
“I have the upmost (sic) 
respect 
for 
Sava 
and 
the 
establishments she has built 
from scratch and that is why it 
was so heartbreaking to see what 
was willingly condoned and even 
on a certain level encouraged in 
her restaurant,” Castro-Santos 
wrote. 
About one year after Castro-
Santos’s email, former Sava’s 
employee Ghia Parow alleged 
that Esquivel and a male cook 
committed sexual misconduct 
against her. 

Parow posted on her Facebook 
page about the incident. Before 
she made the post private, it was 
shared 628 times, with many 
former employees sharing their 
own stories of alleged sexual 
harassment 
and 
misconduct 
at Sava’s and Aventura, two 
restaurants owned by SavCo 
Hospitality.
Esquivel, who also goes by 
“Gustavo Salazar,” according to 
confidential Sava’s documents 
obtained by The Daily, did not 
respond to multiple messages 
from 
The 
Daily 
requesting 
comment for this article.
“I think Gustavo was very 
good at his job but I don’t think 
that should matter,” Castro-
Santos said in an interview with 
The Daily. “If you’re choosing 
to give your money to this 
company, you’re making a very 
clear statement about what your 
values are and whether you value 
the quality of human life for 
women.”
Sava’s is widely considered 
a staple of the Ann Arbor food 
scene. Last year, The Daily 
ranked it as the “Best Romantic 
Dinner” in its yearly Best of 
Ann Arbor series. Aventura, a 
Spanish 
inspired-restaurant 
and bar, and Wilma’s, a trendy, 
health-minded cafe, are other 
SavCo Hospitality-owned local 
favorites.
An investigation by The Daily 
uncovered numerous previously 
undisclosed allegations of sexual 
harassment 
and 
misconduct 
from former Sava’s employees 
against other employees since 
June 2018. The allegations range 
from sexually explicit verbal 
statements to groping, unwanted 
touching and propositions for 
sex.
The Daily found evidence that 
SavCo Hospitality management 

was repeatedly made aware of 
many of these allegations.
The Daily contacted Sava 
Farah and SavCo Hospitality 
requesting comment for this 
article, and was referred to Chief 
of Staff Janelle Zini.
“We are beyond disappointed 
that an institution like the 
Michigan Daily would engage 
in 
such 
inaccurate 
and 
irresponsible reporting,” Zini 
wrote in a statement to The 
Daily. “These claims are so far 
from the truth that it would be 
absurd for us to respond. We 
have no further comment and 
are focused on continuing to 
take care of our staff and guests.”
Zini 
noted 
that 
SavCo 
Hospitality could not turn over 
more confidential employment 
information, 
citing 
SavCo 
Hospitality’s 
obligations 
as 
employers.
Management disputed these 
allegations to staff. In an email 
to SavCo Hospitality employees 
sent Tuesday evening, a copy 
of which was obtained by The 
Daily, Zini and SavCo Hospitality 
Training & HR Manager Maggie 
Jennings reiterated their belief 
that they could not respond to 
The Daily’s reporting.
“In 
order 
to 
maintain 
confidentiality of all parties 
involved, SavCo is unable to 
respond to these claims even 
when every ounce of us wants 
to take this opportunity to 
illustrate the reality of each 
of 
these 
mischaracterized 
situations,” Jennings and Zini 
wrote. “What we can say is 
that we stand behind the way 
any instances of misconduct or 
harassment have been, and will 
continue to be, handled and 
addressed.”
The Daily was provided with 
a statement from Laura Peretick, 

a server at Sava’s for the past 
seven and a half years. Peretick 
is also president of the Employee 
Experience Council, a group 
that she wrote “gather(s) once a 
month to discuss how to improve 
the employee experience, and 
create positive change in our 
restaurants.”
Peretick said in her time 
working at Sava’s, she never once 
felt “unsafe.” 
“I am very proud to work 
at Sava’s, and to be a part of an 
organization that truly cares 
about it’s (sic) employees. My 
immediate managers, as well as 
upper management take our well 
being very seriously,” Peretick 
wrote in an emailed statement 
to The Daily. “I have seen lives 
transform here because Sava’s 
gave them a chance. I have seen 
countless times my managers 
go above and beyond for my 
co-workers.”
Peretick said she believed 
Sava’s 
handled 
allegations 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 
with 
integrity, adding that she was 
involved with the investigation 
into Parow’s allegations.
“This is not an organization 
that 
takes 
sexual 
assault 
allegations 
against 
it’s 
(sic) 
people lightly,” Peretick wrote. 
“To 
say 
that 
management 
mishandled the situation alleged 
in the Facebook post, fueling your 
article, is absolutely false. There 
was a thorough investigation 
that I personally was a part of. 
I know all parties involved in 
the claim very well and I solidly 
stand behind Sava’s.”
Castro-Santos attributed the 
disparity in experiences between 
employees to a difference in 
culture between the workers in 
the front of the house — meaning 
employees who interact with 
customers — and the those in 

back of the house, which includes 
the kitchen.
In her first month working 
at Sava’s in May 2018, Castro-
Santos 
said 
she 
witnessed 
occasional 
sexually 
explicit 
verbal 
statements, 
though 
she attributed this to kitchen 
culture.
“I’d 
worked 
in 
kitchens 
before,” 
Castro-Santos 
said. 
“Sexist stuff sometimes happens 
in the kitchen because it usually 
is a male-dominated field.”
However, 
Castro-Santos 
alleged the restaurant’s culture 
worsened toward the beginning 
of June 2018, with the arrival of 
Esquivel. 
Castro-Santos 
alleged 
that 
an employee warned her about 
what he thought Esquivel might 
do to her.
“I was told by (an employee) 
that I would be ‘if not groped 
then at least verbally harassed,’” 
Castro-Santos wrote in her July 
28 email to Sava’s management.
She alleged in her email 
that another male employee 
repeatedly 
verbally 
harassed 
her. 
Management 
from 
the 
restaurant, 
Castro-Santos 
alleged, repeatedly witnessed 
these comments.
“(I)t became a joke on the line 
that he would verbally harass 
me daily. Everyone working in 
the kitchen knew about it, but 
nothing was ever actually done 
about it,” Castro-Santos wrote 
in her letter to management. “If I 
were a man … I wouldn’t be given 
demeaning nicknames.”
She alleged that she was 
subjected to more than 20 
instances of unwanted touching 
from other employees while 
working along the kitchen’s 
narrow line in a six-hour shift.
“Men who worked there would 
walk behind me,” Castro-Santos 

told The Daily. “And when they 
walked behind me, they would 
always grab my waist.”
Three days after sending her 
email, Castro-Santos received a 
reply from Farah, who referenced 
her own experiences of sexual 
harassment at a restaurant when 
she was younger. 
“As a woman who started 
working in kitchens at 13 years 
old, I was exposed to this type 
of misconduct 20 years ago — at 
a time when sadly, no one was 
willing to hear about this sort 
of thing,” Farah wrote. “Long 
since, I have vowed to run things 
differently in my business and I 
have always taken pride in the 
fact that our kitchen culture 
is female friendly, until now, 
hearing about your encounters.”
Farah 
told 
Castro-Santos 
Sava’s would take action to 
address her allegations.
“What you experienced and 
how you were treated should 
have never happened and I am 
deeply regretful for the conduct 
you reported and the responses 
from my managers that left 
you feeling dismissed an (sic) 
unheard,” Farah wrote. “As of 
receiving your note, we have 
implemented a hyper vigilant 
zero-tolerance 
policy 
for 
harassment of any type, we have 
re-trained every single manager 
on our policy and also how to 
properly handle these matters in 
the future and we have held each 
person in your email accountable 
to their actions and inactions.” 
On April 6, 2019, another 
Sava’s employee complained to 
management 
about 
Esquivel, 
this time over sexually explicit 
comments 
she 
witnessed 
Esquivel make against Parow.

Notice to all Students 
Regarding Suspended Fraternity

The Chi Phi Fraternity at the University of Michigan was placed 
on temporary suspension by the Fraternity’s Grand Council on 
January 12, 2020, effective immediately. Members of the Chapter 
were instructed to cease operations immediately and were placed 
on Alumni status.

The Fraternity appreciates the University community’s cooperation in 
this matter and encourages you to report any operating efforts of 
this group to the Fraternity’s Executive Director Michael Azarian at 
azarian@chiphi.org

One such comment Esquivel 
allegedly made was to call 
Parow “sucia,” which means 
“dirty” in Spanish, a slang term 
for whore. This employee asked 
to be identified by only her first 
name, Savannah, out of fear of 
professional retribution.
“I had noticed that in the 
kitchen they were calling her 
‘sucia,’” Savannah said. “They 
were harassing her so I went to 
a manager.”
Sava’s 
management 
told 
Savannah they would address 
this issue, but Savannah alleged 
she saw no response to this 
complaint.
“They’re like, ‘Oh okay we’ll 
definitely 
deal 
with 
this,’” 
Savannah said. “And nothing 
happened.”
SavCo Hospitality terminated 
Savannah’s employment April 
30, 2019. In a letter sent to 
Savannah, a photo of which was 
obtained by The Daily, a Sava’s 
manager explained that her 
termination was related to her 
telling other employees what she 
claims she had witnessed.
“Most 
recently, 
there 
were two incidents in which 
employees named you as the 
individual that told them stories 
regarding 
sexual 
harassment 
issues not being addressed in 
the workplace resulting in them 
no longer wanting to work at 
our establishment,” the Sava’s 
manager wrote. “... Both incidents 
that those individuals reported 
hearing from you specifically are 
untrue and have been thoroughly 
investigated and concluded with 
the individuals involved.”
The manager said this was 
why Savannah was being fired.
“While we can’t assume your 
intentions, the consequences of 
your behavior are beyond repair 
and this is why we must part ways 
with you effective immediately,” 
the manager wrote. 
“We can no longer condone the 
toxic and harmful way in which you 
conduct yourself.”
***
The alleged sexual misconduct 
described in Parow’s Facebook post 
took place weeks after Savannah 
reported Esquivel’s alleged “sucia” 
comments to Sava’s management. 
The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 
three 
individuals with knowledge of 
Parow’s description of these events 
from before they became public. All 
three corroborated the consistency 
of Parow’s account of the alleged 
sexual misconduct.
Parow alleged that after a private 
dining event, she walked towards 
an outside underground storage 
facility, which employees call the 
“Dungeon.” Esquivel and another 
kitchen employee allegedly grabbed 
her by the arms and tried to force 
her into the Dungeon.
No 
other 
individuals 
were 
present to witness this incident. 
The other kitchen employee did 
not respond to multiple requests for 
comment.
“We’re going to rape you,” they 
said, according to Parow. 
Ever since she first made her 
allegations this summer, Parow 
has maintained that she does not 
remember what happened after 
that statement. Though she had 
not consumed alcohol, she said 
that she “blacked out” at this point, 
according to interviews with Parow 
and two other employees.
The Daily obtained a copy of 
SavCo Hospitality’s investigation 
into Parow’s claim. 
According to the investigation, 
Esquivel and the other chef denied 
pulling Parow into a storage area 
or threatening sexual assault. They 
alleged that Parow had repeatedly 
made sexual jokes and comments 
to them in the months leading up 
to the incident, something that the 

investigation notes Esquivel had 
once reported to another manager. 
Parow’s claim of the alleged 
sexual misconduct was found to be 
unsubstantiated.
The investigation also notes that 
“a final warning” had been issued to 
Esquivel.
Following 
a 
meeting 
with 
Human Resources representatives, 
management 
removed 
Parow 
from future private dining events. 
According to Parow, they agreed 
she should take time off for her 
mental health.
At a later meeting, Parow was 
given a contract releasing SavCo 
Hospitality from any liability if 
Parow sought to sue them at a later 
date.
“I was in no place to be signing 
absolutely anything,” Parow said. 
“I was a fucking mess. I was so 
scared. I was always looking over 
my shoulder at the time. I thought 
it was for my paid time off, and I 
needed rent. Rent was due almost 
… I signed it, I walked out of there.” 
Parow had also signed a non-
disparagement agreement as part of 
her initial employment paperwork. 
The 
agreement 
specifically 
prohibits Parow from speaking 
negatively 
of 
any 
“employee, 
business or process” of SavCo 
Hospitality.
Non-disparagement agreements, 
or NDAs, have come under scrutiny 
in the wake of the #MeToo 
movement. In December, The Daily 
reported on confidential NDAs 
reached between the University of 
Michigan and former employees, 
agreements totalling approximately 
$1.265 million over a six-month 
period. Ex-University employees 
complained that the agreements 
silenced them by stifling criticism of 
their former employer.
The Daily found evidence of two 
non-disparagement 
agreements, 
including Parow’s, that SavCo 
Hospitality reached with former 
employees. Both had been included 
in documents the employees signed 
when starting their employment. 
Though Parow worked at Sava’s 
and the other employee worked 
at Aventura, the terms of these 
agreements were nearly identical. 
It is unclear if these agreements 
are still included in incoming 
employment paperwork.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Ally Coll, the president of the 
#MeToo 
advocacy 
organization 
The Purple Campaign said these 
agreements 
have 
debilitating 
effects on public discourse around 
allegations of harassment and 
misconduct.
“(NDAs) 
have 
allowed 
organizations and leadership at 
organizations to avoid actually 
addressing the underlying issue,” 
Coll said.
Companies that reach these 
agreements are also emboldened, 
Coll explained, to not resolve claims 
of harassment and misconduct 
equitably. 
“They no longer are as worried 
about making sure that both parties 
feel that their claims were fairly 
resolved,” Coll said.
***
On Aug. 12, 2019, Parow posted 
an account of the incident with 
Esquivel and Sava’s management’s 
response on Facebook. Though 
they had offered her a position at 
another SavCo Hospitality-owned 
restaurant, she had quit working for 
the company months earlier.
Parow alleged that management 
brushed off her complaint.
“They did not want to hear it. 
They put it away, they covered it 
up,” Parow said in an interview with 
The Daily. “They knew, just because 
this stuff has happened before and 
my Facebook post has brought out a 
lot of women to come forward and 
share. So I’m not afraid of being 
called a liar or anything, because it’s 
the fucking truth.”
In 
response 
to 
Parrow’s 
post, SavCo Hospitality shared 
a statement on Facebook. The 

statement has since been taken 
down.
“We want everyone to know 
that any and all alleged incidents 
that have been brought to the 
company’s attention have been 
fully investigated and handled 
with care. We do not tolerate 
any type of harassment in our 
company,” 
SavCo 
Hospitality 
wrote, according to an article from 
MLive. “The situation in question 
was thoroughly investigated over 
several weeks, including interviews 
with all parties involved … We took 
the situation very seriously, and we 
are certain we handled this matter 
appropriately, 
given 
a 
diligent 
investigation and several objective 
individuals all reaching the same 
conclusion.”
Farah discussed the investigation 
in an interview with MLive in 
August.
“We apologize for the experience 
she’s having, but we investigated, 
and 
it 
came 
out 
completely 
unsubstantiated,” Farah said. 
The Daily spoke with another 
Sava’s employee familiar with 
the 
circumstances 
of 
Parow’s 
allegations of sexual misconduct. 
The employee declined to be named 
for fear of professional retribution. 
They claimed Farah described 
Esquivel and the chef’s actions as 
a joke in a private conversation. 
This was after SavCo Hospitality 
concluded its investigation of the 
incident, and the employee believed 
this was the final finding. 
“(Farah told me) the incident was 
a joke,” the employee said. “But it 
was okay … because Gustavo knew 
that it was inappropriate now.”
The Daily spoke to another Sava’s 
employee working at the restaurant 
at the time that the investigation 
into Parow’s claim concluded. This 
employee asked to be referred to 
only by their first name, Sam, citing 
fears of professional retribution.
Sam claimed company-wide staff 
meetings were held to discuss the 
findings of the investigation into 
Parow’s allegations, but employees 
had a difficult time asking questions 
because management dominated 
the conversation. 
Sam said they believed these 
meetings were organized to scare 
employees from speaking publicly 
about the allegations.
“I genuinely believe they did that, 
purposefully, so that they could 
hear less voices, get less feedback 
and create this culture of silence,” 
Sam said. 
In 
text 
messages 
between 
Parow and Farah shortly after 
Parow’s Facebook post, Farah 
threatened Parow with a lawsuit. 
Parow provided copies of these text 
messages to The Daily.
“This is a gross misrepresentation 
of what occurred and if I have to 
defend myself I will have to have 
my legal team hit you with a slander 
lawsuit tomorrow morning,” Farah 
wrote.
Parow said she felt betrayed by 
SavCo management. She had once 
thought highly enough of Farah to 
get a tattoo of the Albanian word 
“besa” — referring to the Albanian 
code of honor — after it featured 
prominently in a TEDx Talk Farah 
gave in March 2018.
“I was in awe of (Farah),” Parow 
said. “I looked up to her … I was 
proud to work for her — a powerful 
woman-owned business. I was 
really about that.”
Parow took down her Facebook 
post. Farah never sued. 
***
The Daily spoke with three other 
former Sava’s employees. Two of the 
employees requested anonymity, 
citing 
fears 
of 
professional 
retribution. In this article, one will 
be referred to as Anne and the other 
as Jane.
Jane alleged that male workers 
repeatedly 
harassed 
her 
with 
sexual innuendos and sexist verbal 
statements. In one instance, she 
recalled a male worker allegedly 
asking her for details about her 

romantic relationship.
Jane also alleged that male 
workers 
repeatedly 
touched 
her, often inappropriately, while 
walking past her in the kitchen. 
She said this occurred so often she 
became desensitized to it. 
“It was every single day,” Jane 
said. “You would just kind of let it 
happen after a while because it’s 
just — they’re not going to stop.”
Anne alleged that when Esquivel 
began touching her inappropriately 
another male employee mimicked 
him.
“(A male employee) saw what 
Gustavo was doing to me and started 
imitating his actions,” Anne said. 
“Like grabbing my butt and like 
getting really close to me.”
She alleged that this continued 
throughout her time in the 
restaurant’s kitchen.
“The groping would happen a 
lot,” Anne said. “The trying to go 
down my pants happened a few 
times.”
Anne spoke of an incident in 
which a male employee — the 
same 
employee 
who 
Parow 
alleges cornered her in the 
Dungeon with Esquivel — and 
Esquivel 
allegedly 
followed 
her into a storage area and 
propositioned her for sex, asking 
if she would have a “threesome” 
with them.
“I said, ‘I won’t even have sex 
with one of you. What makes 
you think I’m going to have a 
threesome?’” Anne said. “It was 
just that they all had this mindset 
that that’s just what I do.”
Jane also spoke of an incident 
in 
which 
Esquivel 
allegedly 
kissed an employee in view of one 
of the restaurant’s security cameras. 
It is unclear whether this incident 
was recorded or if a recording still 
exists.
When 
Anne 
later 
brought 
forward 
an 
allegation 
of 
misconduct, she, like Castro-Santos, 
thought Esquivel’s status affected 
the company’s response.
“They went into saying how great 
Gustavo is for this company and 
they just wouldn’t stop talking 
about it,” Anne said. 
The implication, she thought, 
was that if she didn’t withdraw 
her complaint, “they’ll be losing 
their most prized chef.”
Mimi 
Verdiyan, 
another 
former Sava’s employee, wrote 
of her skepticism regarding the 
investigation process. 
“I never witnessed any sexual 
misconduct myself,” Verdiyan 
wrote in a message to The Daily. 
“The way (other allegations 
were) handled was messed up.” 
Verdiyan 
described 
the 
process by which information 
about 
allegations 
was 
disseminated to employees. She 
said she heard other employees 
discuss these investigations.
“The 
people 
who 
went 
through 
the 
‘investigation 
process’ did mention that it 
wasn’t really an investigation 
and more a strategy to dissolve 
the issue itself,” Verdiyan wrote. 
“Just weird insidious ways to 
keep everyone from asking too 
many questions.”
Verdiyan said she experienced 
something similar when she 
made a complaint about racial 
discrimination. 
“They had similar strategies 
when (a) situation with racial 
discrimination 
at 
the 
host 
stand was starting to surface,” 
Verdiyan wrote. “Which again is 
what I was closer to.”

Dan 
Rodaire, 
a 
former 
employee of Aventura alleged he 
witnessed repeated harassment 
against other employees. It was 
Parow’s post that led Rodaire 
to come forward with his own 
allegations. 
He 
shared 
his 
experiences in a Facebook post 
responding to Parow’s post.
“Dear Ghia, I’ve never met 
you but I am absolutely sure 
that everything you’re saying is 
true because I had an extremely 
similar 
experience 
working 
at 
Sava’s 
sister 
restaurant, 
Aventura,” Rodaire wrote. “I 
was fired in direct response to 
a meeting with management in 
which I had reported continual 
sexual 
harassment 
from 
a 
prominent 
kitchen 
employee 
towards almost, if not all, of the 
women who worked as server 
assistants, among others.”
In an interview with The 
Daily, Rodaire said that he made 
several reports to management 
about this harassment. In his 
Facebook post, he alleged that 
upper management was aware 
of it.
“As someone who spent a lot 
of time in the manager’s office 
fighting for what I believed in — 
I knew for a fact that all of upper 

SAVCO

management was aware of these 
problems,” Rodaire wrote. 
Rodaire also spoke of the 
disparity between the front of 
house and back of house cultures 
at Aventura.
“There 
are 
two 
totally 
different worlds at Aventura,” 
Rodaire said in an interview with 
The Daily. “There’s the front of 
house and then the back of house. 
The front of house is mainly 
University of Michigan students, 
and I’d say that ethical standards 
for the most part were upheld in 
front of the guests. The upstairs 
world was mainly regulated, but 
the downstairs world was not.”
Many former employees said 
they believe SavCo Hospitality 
will not change its responses to 
allegations of sexual harassment 
and misconduct until it begins to 
affect the company’s bottom line. 
“They can’t possibly publicly 
believe (Parow) or acknowledge 
the truth of her story in any way 
because they would lose money,” 
Sam said. “They work in the 
interest of creating a profit and if 
their profit is going to be harmed 

by allegations of sexual assault 
then they would do anything that 
they can to tamp those down.”
Rodaire 
noted 
SavCo 
Hospitality’s emphasis on their 
public image.
“If 
they 
were 
to 
fire 
(an 
employee) 
for 
sexual 
harassment, the story would 
become about them,” Rodaire 
said. “It would put their name in 
the press, and that’s what they 
don’t want.”
Castro-Santos said she refuses 
to support restaurants owned 
by SavCo Hospitality after her 
experience working for them. 
“I have very strong feelings 
about 
not 
giving 
them 
my 
money,” Castro-Santos said. “I 
think that we individually have 
a responsibility to ourselves 
and other people to not endorse 
a company that doesn’t need 
our money and doesn’t help its 
employees — doesn’t care about 
its employees.”

This past November, voters in 
the U.S. made history by electing 
not 
one, 
but 
two 
incredible 
Muslim women into our 116th 
House of Representatives. They 
are Ilhan Omar, a Black, Somali 
Immigrant 
from 
Minnesota’s 
5th Congressional district who 
frequently and unabashedly calls 
out deeply problematic white men 
in power, and Rashida Tlaib, an 
incredible 
Palestinian-American 
woman who coined the phrase 
“Impeach the Motherf*cker” on 
her first day in office. 
Rep. Tlaib and Rep. Omar 
were 
praised 
nationally 
for 
their progressivism and their 
commitment 
to 
civil 
rights. 
They posed on magazine covers, 
standing alongside new Speaker of 
the House Nancy Pelosi. They were 
even affectionately made a part 
of the “squad” of freshmen WoC 
Representatives, along with Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New 
York and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of 
Massachusetts. 
That is until they decided to 
speak out on an issue that is seen 
as largely untouchable in US 
politics: defending the rights of 
Palestinians.
Many who follow politics know 
about 
Rep. 
Omar’s 
infamous 
response to a tweet from a 
journalist who spoke about how 

the House GOP Leader Kevin 
McCarthy was threatening to 
punish Omar and Tlaib for their 
criticism of Israel. Omar wrote 
back “It’s all about the Benjamins 
baby,” and later clarified that she 
was talking about AIPAC, the 
American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee. AIPAC spends about 
3.5 million dollars in lobbying cash 
to support pro-Israeli interests 
in the United States. Omar was 
immediately attacked by both 
Democrats and Republicans – one 
of the few bipartisan partnerships 
of this past year.
I’m not going to get into the 
nuances of the history of Israel 
and Palestine and the conflict 
today, mostly because it’s far 
too much to compress into a few 
inches of paper, and I would 
absolutely oversimplify. Instead, 
I suggest that you do your own 
research, especially into Arab, and 
most especially into Palestinian 
voices. What I will say is this: 
criticism of the Israeli government 
shouldn’t be confused with anti-
Semitism. Criticism of the Israeli 
government is a matter of calling 
out the institution’s numerous 
human rights violations against an 
occupied people who have little to 
no right to self-determination. 
Rep. Omar ended up apologizing 
for 
her 
statements, 
yet 
she 
continued to be silenced not only 
by the usual suspects (Trump and 
Republicans) but also by her own 
party. House Democrats were 

quick to vote on a resolution that 
condemned hate speech — a move 
that was widely seen as a callout of 
Omar. What I find ironic, though, 
is that the same institutions 
and organizations that initially 
praised the election of the two 
first Muslim congresswomen were 
also so quick to attack them the 
moment that they said something 
beyond the mainstream ideas of 
“progressivism.”
But these attacks are not 
surprising. As a Muslim and 
Arab-American 
woman 
who 
has been in activist and feminist 
spaces for most of my teen years, 
it proved everything that I had 
ever suspected: that a lot of 
calls for inclusion are, frankly, 
disingenuous. So-called feminist 
organizations call for us to join 
their ranks, to be a part of their 
crusade against the patriarchy, 
and then ignore the perspectives of 
Arab and Muslim women. They call 
for the freedom of women to wear 
whatever they want without facing 
harassment, but a Muslim woman 
wearing a hijab, niqab or burqa 
is viewed as “oppressed,” rather 
than as making a deeply personal 
and spiritual choice. A Muslim 
woman might feel uncomfortable 
about how so much attention in 
feminist spaces is focused on sex-
positivity rather than issues like 
inaccessibility to education and 
employment for women, maternal 
and gender-based health, gender-
based violence, FGM, etc. However, 

she might not feel comfortable 
expressing her opinions for fear 
of being ignored as “prudish” and 
potentially ostracized by the very 
women who claim to fight for “all 
women’s rights.”
 Diversity matters to us! ... until 
we speak out. 
Listen to women of color! ... until 
we say something that you don’t 
like. 
Stand with Muslim women! 
w... but only until we go off our 
predetermined script.
What all of these people seem to 
realize though, is that just because 
you elect a Muslim representative, 
it doesn’t mean that they’re going 
fade into the woodwork once the 
excitement has lulled. Rep. Omar 
and Rep. Tlaib were not elected 
in their districts in order to give 
the Democratic Party good PR, or 
glossy magazine spreads with their 
arms crossed, dressed in muted 
tones of red, white and blue. They 
were elected to change the world 
for the better, and sometimes that 
requires speaking when no one else 
will.
Reader, I challenge you. It 
doesn’t suffice to apologize and 
offer platitudes, promising that 
you’ll do better, that you’ll listen, 
that 
you’ll 
learn. 
Compassion 
without action is just observation. 
Put in the work to learn about 
Muslim women – our issues, 
our feelings, our perspectives. 
Approach us, talk to us. Most of us 
have been waiting for a while.

A First Generation’s 
Lullaby of Loss

“Ruchi, how do you live 
like this? How will you get 
married?” my mother shook 
her head, sifting through the 
ruins of my room. A dissonant 
pitch filled the air. Being young, 
messy rooms, disheveled hair 
and an outspoken voice were 
the products of my outright 
opposition. I sat in the only 
cleared portion of my room, 
shoulders 
firm, 
head 
high, 
basking in the glory of my 

rebellion. 
Growing up in a South-
Asian household posed a life 
long ultimatum, as concepts of 
independence and traditional 
notions of womanhood often 
felt mutually exclusive. Every 
invitation from my mother to 
cook had to be accompanied by 
an elaborate scheme to shape 
me into a domestic role. My 
mother’s requests of tabling out 
chai and chaat to guests were 
indirect requests to jeopardize 
my autonomy. The song of my 
dissent climaxed, with me, the 
melodist, stringing together an 

anthem of independence. 
 In college, I stand now, 
softer, more resolute in my self-
determination. I go home for 
the holidays and see the lines 
in my mother’s face. Older, 
tired, she no longer invites me 
to harmonize. My shoulders 
hunch. I lean forward with the 
weight of loss shrouding me. I 
sit with a solemn understanding 
of my “choice,” as generations 
of tradition have now been 
drowned out by my stanzas. 
Now, I sit, in messy rooms, 
empty kitchens, a delicate dirge 
sinking into my skin.

The Public Shaming of Ilhan Omar, Or, What Happens 
When Disingenuous Diversity Backfires On You

HIBA DAGHER

This piece is a self-portrait focused on disconnection from identity. I made this when I was feeling pretty confused about my own 
identity. The butterfly is supposed to represent the disconnect of soul, and the blood represents disconnect from the body.

I talk to God in the dark.
Thank him thirty-three times.
Give praise thirty-three times.
Thirty-three times I say
I’m sorry.
I ask for forgiveness.
Often not knowing what for.
 
My mother used to
light incense. Stand over us
in the dark.
And send her prayers
in the smoke.
 
On those nights
I stayed awake.
Saw the smoke take on

the form of a woman
lost in the desert,
a man being swallowed
by a whale, a serpent
inhaling the world whole.
 
Mornings were greeted
by the smell of ash.
And anxiety ridden
memories we did not live,
the fear of mistakes
we had not yet made.
And love.
 
My existence was delivered
by sin. I wonder if God knows
I’m sorry
To be alive. Wonder if that’s why
I spent this lifetime 
swallowing saltwater
in anticipation of drowning.

If living is my penance.

I wish my body was not
made of mud and ruin.
I fantasize combusting
into fire and lighting
my own way.
 
But none of my history
Is history enough to learn from.
My fingers do not recognize
they were made to count
prayers. My hands reach too far.
 
My mother does not come
into my room anymore.
Those empty nights
I still get down on my knees,
Press my head to the floor,
And search for something holy.

“Ninety-Nine”

The purest form of love I 
have 
experienced 
has 
come 
from friendships. I have always 
believed that a soulmate does not 
have to come from a romantic 
relationship. A soulmate can 
be your friend or even a hobby 
that you cannot live without. 
The love my friends have shown 
me is so pure and it ranges from 
having my hand held when I cry 
to having them stay in my room 
until I fall asleep. It is in these 
moments that I realize how deep 
our bonds run and how lucky 
I am to have such powerful 
women in my life. 

“Para: 
Mis Amigas”

DANIELA LUGO
Senior MiC Creative Content Editor
She told me that she didn’t 
believe in love. 
I found this hard to believe 
because 
the 
Beatles 
had 
convinced me that it is all that 
we need. I had first heard of her 
through a friend who struggled 
to find words of meaning and 
instead sufficed for cheap laughs 
and empty spaces. 
After being stuck somewhere 
between 
Philadelphia 
and 
Hanover, with brief trips to 
Jerusalem, we finally crossed 
paths. And when I saw her 
standing there, the gaze from 
her emerald eyes had sent me 
searching for the same words 
which my friend had struggled 

with. 
I spent the majority of our 
time together thinking of clever 
lines as she sipped on a cherry 
Pepsi, fooling everyone who was 
a fool for her. But like the fool 
who failed to play it cool, the 
brief moment that we did share 
left me hanging off a cliff. There 
was something in the way she 
moved which attracted me like 
no other. 
Our 
ease 
and 
mutual 
understanding 
made 
that 
ordinary 
porch 
feel 
like 
a 
strawberry field. Made me feel 
like I wasn’t alone in what felt 
like a crowd full of strangers.
But eventually, I traded her 
emerald gaze for the glare of 
blue iPhone read receipts and 
conversations for texts which 
could have easily been forgotten. 

Effortless in a different sense, I 
suppose. This isn’t to disregard 
some of our moments which felt 
larger than life. But somehow, 
the closer we seemed to get, 
the more we seemed to distance 
ourselves from each other. 
Did we run the risk of 
talking until we couldn’t go on? 
Ignoring the chance that we may 
fall apart before too long?
Like a castaway, looking at 
my phone as if it were a compass 
that gave me no direction. Man 
overboard! Jumped into a sea 
of unanswered questions and 
unresolved emotions.
So tell me Jude, does letting 
her into your heart and under 
your skin make it better? Or 
is it just that the long and 
winding road may not lead to 
her door?

“Jude? Are You Still There?”

C

oming out of the Iowa 
caucus 
victorious, 
Democratic 
candidate 
and Mayor of South Bend, Ind., 
Pete Buttigieg has seen a recent 
surge in popularity. Because he 
is the first openly gay person 
to make a serious bid for the 
presidency, Buttigieg’s success 
is undoubtedly a big moment for 
LGBTQ+ Americans, especially 
in a state like Iowa that voted 
for Donald Trump four years 
ago. 
However, 
that 
hasn’t 
made him the community’s 
champion. LGBTQ+ voters in 
Iowa strongly favored Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, 
I-Vt., 
and 
even preferred Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., to Buttigieg. 
This may seem strange from 
an outside perspective, but 
the truth is that Buttigieg has 
fallen short on many of the 
issues that impact everyday 
LGBTQ+ Americans.
Perhaps 
the 
biggest 
controversy 
surrounding 
Buttigieg is the poor relations 
between 
nonwhite 
citizens 
and the police force in South 
Bend under his leadership. Just 
months after becoming mayor, 
he fired police chief Darryl 
Boykins for allegations that he 
had recorded white officers 
using racist language, including 
that in reference to Boykins 
himself. Boykins was one of 
three Black public leaders in 
South Bend, all of whom were 
gone within three months of 
Buttigieg’s first day; meanwhile, 
some of the recorded officers 
have since moved into higher 
positions 
and 
the 
city’s 
settlement awarded them 10 
times as much money as it did 
Boykins. That same year, a Black 
teen was beaten and shot with a 
stun gun in his own home (and 
was awarded $18 in 2016 for his 
troubles by the court), and last 
year a Black man was shot dead 
by a white SBPD officer with no 
body cam turned on. In a city 
with a 27 percent Black and 15 
percent Latinx population, the 
police department is 90 percent 
white.

As mayor, it is crucial that 
Buttigieg address his police 
department’s mistreatment of 
marginalized people, but he 
has failed to do so. In the wake 
of the fatal shooting, Mayor 
Buttigieg 
began 
discussions 
with activists in which he 
denied requests to fire the police 
chief over his subordinate’s 
deadly misconduct — which is 
especially poignant given his 
swiftness in firing Chief Boykins 
for audio recordings. As talks 
with activists trickled down 
the 
bureaucratic 
hierarchy 
and more and more officials 
ignored requests for comment, 
SBPD officers brought firearms 
to community meetings about 
police brutality — meetings that 
the mayor promised, and failed, 
to attend.
As it so happens, LGBTQ+ 
Americans also have a history 
fraught with police violence. 
The catalyst for the modern gay 
rights movement was a series 
of riots against police raiding 
gay- 
and 
trans-frequented 
establishments like Compton’s 
Cafeteria 
in 
1966 
and 
the 
Stonewall Inn in 1969. There’s 
a reason trans women of color 
like Sylvia Rivera are credited 
with starting the fight; trans 
and nonwhite LGBTQ+ folk 
were outcast from mainstream 
society to the point that they 
relied solely on their own found 
families 
of 
other 
LGBTQ+ 
people to survive, like the 
houses 
of 
ballroom 
culture 
portrayed in “Paris is Burning.” 
Trans people and queer people 
of color had almost nothing to 
lose. Police violence against 
LGBTQ+ 
people 
remains 
pervasive to this day — 48 
percent of LGBTQ+ survivors 
of violence who have interacted 
with police have experienced 
police misconduct as of 2013 
— and it’s just as disturbing as 
the police brutality was half a 
century ago at the time of the 
riots. Some cases, like that of 
the transgender women in the 
Sacramento County Jail in the 
early 2000s, are akin to mental 

and physical torture, including 
regularly being paraded around 
shirtless before male inmates, 
hearing threats and slurs from 
officers and prisoners alike and 
rape. Needless to say, queer 
people are sensitive to issues 
of police brutality such as 
those frequently seen in South 
Bend, and for the estimated 42 
percent of LGBTQ+ Americans 
who aren’t white, it is doubly-
important.
There 
are 
many 
other 
issues not directly related to 
the community that have a 
profound impact on LGBTQ+ 
individuals. Buttigieg has said 
that he does not think felons 
should have the right to vote, a 
policy that disproportionately 
disenfranchises 
nonwhite 
and LGBTQ+ people; this is 
even more troubling when you 
consider the sheer size of our 
nation’s 
prison 
population. 
He’s been criticized by the 
community 
for 
volunteering 
with the Salvation Army, which, 
while 
altruistic 
in 
nature, 
displays just how far removed 
he is from the realities of 
LGBTQ+ people less fortunate 
than himself. Salvation Army 
has repeatedly tried to push 
homophobic 
legislation 
and 
deny 
LGBTQ+ 
employees 
benefits or even fire them, and 
as recently as 2017 transgender 
people have been denied help 
by one of their substance abuse 
centers. Buttigieg has even 
spoken out against LGBTQ+ 
media 
for 
criticizing 
him, 
and while his complaints did 
reflect legitimate issues within 
the general community, the 
articles in question were not 
actually written by LGBTQ+ 
media outlets. These comments 
also came at a time where 
many LGBTQ+ outlets were 
downsizing or shutting down, 
as some in the industry pointed 
out, and disparagement from a 
national figure like Buttigieg 
only causes further harm to 
queer journalists and worsens 
public 
perception 
of 
the 
community.
Despite having the potential 
to guarantee votes from much of 
the LGBTQ+ voting bloc, he has 
been quiet about LGBTQ+ civil 
rights issues — so quiet, in fact, 
some voters don’t even know 
he’s gay himself, like an Iowa 
woman who wanted to change 
her vote after finding out. 
Buttigieg has been quiet enough 
on LGBTQ+ issues to draw the 
support of homophobes and 
moderate enough in his politics 
to push away less rich, less 
white LGBTQ+ voters. There’s a 
reason these voters are flocking 
to Sanders specifically, and 
it’s because he has succeeded 
with 
these 
communities 
while 
Buttigieg 
has 
failed. 
Sanders has a long history of 
supporting gay rights, decades 
before it was as popular as it 
is today, sharply contrasting 
Buttigieg’s quietness and less 
divisive, 
more 
“respectable” 
centrism. And, perhaps more 
importantly, 
Sanders 
has 
become the champion for the 
poor and the working class, 
to which LGBTQ+ Americans 
are more likely to belong. So 
long as Pete Buttigieg runs 
on policies that put LGBTQ+ 
people on the backburner at a 
time when our civil rights are in 
direct jeopardy, he will not find 
support from his gay, lesbian, 
bisexual and trans siblings.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A

s kids, we idolize our 
favorite 
athletes 
like 
literal 
superheroes. 
The analogy is obvious as these 
physical specimens not only look 
the part, but have superhuman 
powers, whether they’re jumping 
50 inches in the air to dunk a 
basketball or trucking through 
three men into an end zone. As 
we age, we start to identify less 
with the powers, and more with 
the individuals themselves — for 
instance, in the Avengers movies, 
the conflicting ideals of Iron Man 
and Captain America about how 
they should use their powers 
are what make the movie so 
compelling, even to adults.
Early on in my life I realized I 
wasn’t cut out to be a professional 
athlete. I lacked the athleticism 
and talent, but still had a passion 
for sports, and as long as the sun 
was out I could be found playing 
pick-up 
football 
or 
shooting 
hoops. Even outside of sports, 
people enjoy things they may not 
have a natural talent for, and may 
often feel deterred from pursuing 
that passion because they fear 
failure.
Growing 
up, 
my 
favorite 
superhero was Batman — from 
the tech he possessed to his cool, 
measured demeanor, he was the 
ultimate threat to all villains of 
Gotham City. Oddly enough, a 
major appeal of Batman is that 

he actually doesn’t have any 
super powers. He is driven by his 
mentality, which stems from the 
memory of his late parents and 
provides fuel to eradicate crime 
and help humanity. Bruce Wayne 
could be any man with fire and 
drive for a cause, and that persona 
could inspire any average person 
to do amazing things. 
As an athlete, Kobe Bryant 
was the Batman of basketball, 
a 6-foot-6-inch, lanky shooting 
guard drafted into the NBA at 
the ripe age of 17. Bryant was no 
doubt talented, getting drafted 
as the 13th pick of the first round. 
However, in his first two years, 
Bryant was far from perceived as 
destined for stardom. He came 
off the bench and appeared to 
be headed down the track of a 
solid, steady guard who could 
contribute as a good role player 
for a team. What separated 
Bryant from his peers couldn’t 
be seen in games, or even in 
practice. His passion for the 
game of basketball allowed him 
to transcend the sport itself, and 
become the legend that he is 
known as now. 
Many people view Bryant as 
a personification of persistence, 
dedication and discipline, and 
assume that his success is due to 
some sort of iron will. The truth 
is that the 4 a.m. weight room 
sessions, 1,000 shots a game, 

tactical film sessions to get any 
edge on his match-up that night 
and blood, sweat and tears Kobe 
Bryant put into basketball could 
not be fueled by dutiful willpower. 
He, like any other human, would 
have inevitably given up. To 
consistently be amongst the best 
in the league over his 20-year 
career, he was fueled by the same 
intense passion for the sport that 
existed from the day he picked 
up a basketball. In his own words 
from his letter “Dear Basketball” 
written after his retirement from 
the sport, “I played through the 
sweat and hurt / Not because 
challenge called me / But because 
YOU called me.”
After the tragic passing of the 
Black Mamba, I can’t help but 
reflect on the values that being a 
fan of his instilled in me, and how 
much they have impacted my life 
both now and for the future. There 
are many talented people in the 
world, and it is easy for people to 
get deterred from pursuing their 
passion due to the worry of not 
having what it takes, not having 
the God-given gift someone else 
may. Kobe Bryant is a reminder 
that people should never give 
up on their interest, because the 
only true superpower is that of 
loving something.

Fight the virus, not the people

A 

good friend of mine 
was 
walking 
back 
home from her class. 
For 
whatever 
reason, 
she 
coughed lightly. As soon as 
she did, however, she could 
feel someone looking at her, 
almost giving her a glare, from 
across the street. My friend is 
Korean American.
I live in an apartment where 
other international students 
from a number of different 
countries reside. I have run 
into neighbors who come from 
India, France, China and more 
places. One day, as I let out a 
big breath of relief the long day 
was over while waiting for the 
elevator up to the eighth floor, 
three of my neighbors joined 
me. One was from China. 
He was talking on the phone 
before getting in the elevator, 
and I could make out some of 
what he was saying, thanks to 
my Chinese minor. The other 
two were English-speaking 
male friends. The four of us 
boarded the elevator. By the 
time we reached the third 
floor, my Chinese neighbor let 
out a sneeze. Unfortunately, it 
was loosely covered as it may 
have caught him somewhat 
off guard. The two English-
speaking friends immediately 
looked at each other as one 
whispered, “Is he …?”
Novel 
coronavirus 
originated from Wuhan, a 
city in Hubei province of 
mainland 
China. 
The 
city 
has a population of nearly 
20 million and is the sixth 
biggest in China. According 
to the BBC, there are more 
than 
17,000 
confirmed 
coronavirus cases and some 
361 deaths in China. Experts 

are saying it is still too early 
to 
determine 
exactly 
how 
fatal the disease is due to the 
possibility of undocumented 
cases. However, most infected 
people are expected to fully 
recover in a week, like from 
a normal flu. Following the 
breakout of this epidemic, 
economists 
and 
financial 
experts 
are 
anticipating 
a disruption in the global 
economy, 
given 
China’s 
emergence 
in 
the 
global 
market as a superpower.

Despite 
the 
severity 
of 
the disease, it is not an 
excuse to overreact against 
Asians in general. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) 
has 
officially 
declared 
a 
global 
health 
emergency. 
Officials 
and 
governing 
bodies, 
including 
the 
Chinese government and the 
University of Michigan, have 
taken measures to prevent 
the disease from spreading 
— though they may differ in 
extent. However, this does 
not give anyone the right to 
bring race or ethnicity into 
the discussion. We see cases 
of 
xenophobia 
and 
racism 
brought 
on 
by 
diseases 
elsewhere. President Trump 

has banned foreign nationals 
from reentering the United 
States if they have traveled 
to China in the past 14 days, 
even though this goes against 
the WHO guidance. It seems 
as if panic about the disease 
is spreading fast. But the 
recent trend of anti-Asian 
racism is not limited to the 
U.S. Some Italian businesses 
are 
not 
allowing 
Chinese 
people entry, and London’s 
Chinatown has turned into a 
ghost town.
As important as it is to be 
conscious about our personal 
hygiene in order to prevent 
the disease from spreading, 
it is equally important to be 
aware that Asians are not 
to blame. There was racial 
backlash with the 2003 severe 
acute respiratory syndrome, 
or 
SARS, 
outbreak. 
Some 
Chinatowns were shunned, 
and similar forms of racism 
arose. 
The 
coronavirus 
epidemic cannot repeat the 
rhetoric of blindly blaming 
Asians, 
especially 
Chinese 
people. 
The 
disease 
may 
have no correlation to its 
alleged origin — a market in 
Wuhan — which means the 
Chinese food the anti-Asian 
racists label as “dirty” or 
“unusual” will be free from 
blame. We must stay away 
from offensive speculation. 
We must understand that we 
are all different in distinct 
ways, including our diet. In 
the end, uninformed bias 
and blind hatred may be 
more 
dangerous 
than 
the 
coronavirus itself.

Anne 
Carson 
can 
come 
across as a writer with no clear 
lineage or influences — even 
as she references the work of 
other authors, her poetry and 
prose seem to float relatively 
free of clear affiliation to any 
contemporary literary trend. 
Her 
career 
as 
a 
classicist 
(with 
a 
generalist’s 
flair: 
she’s written about film and 
modernism extensively) might 
have something to do with this: 
It’s possible to interpret her as 
someone who doesn’t follow 
a writer’s career, but works 
through a set of preoccupations, 
trying to draw ever more out 
of them, like an academic. Her 
writings also represent a specific 
stylistic 
preoccupation 
that 
she has been working out in a 
similar way — the transposition 
of Ancient Greek society and 
literature 
onto 
the 
formal 
constraints of Modernists like 
Beckett and Stein. 
Her 
twenty-first 
book, 
“Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy,” 
should 
be 
recognizable 
in 
form and content to readers 
of Carson. The conceit of this 
work is a sort of transposition 
of the plot of Euripides’ “Helen” 
onto the biography of Marilyn 
Monroe, and more broadly to a 
mid-century milieu of writers, 

filmmakers 
and 
celebrities. 
Arthur Miller, Truman Capote 
and 
Fritz 
Lang 
all 
make 
appearances, or are alluded 
to. The titular Norma Jeane 
Baker (Monroe’s birth name) 
both is and isn’t Marilyn, and 

sometimes takes on other guises 
entirely. The framing device 
for the play, according to The 
Shed’s website, is that the text of 
the play is dictated by an office 
manager to a typist in 1963. 

This isn’t explained or included 
in the slim New Directions 
edition that I am reading from. 
The script is mostly done in 
lineated 
monologue 
broken 
up occasionally by segments 
of prose that resemble lesson 
plans. 
The play is really in dialogue 
with two external texts — both 
the play by Euripides and the 
1952 Fritz Lang film “Clash By 
Night.” The latter, in which 
Monroe plays a small part, is 
centered around an increasingly 
violent 
love 
triangle 
that 
becomes 
an 
antagonism 
between the two men involved. 
The theme of both Euripides’ 
and 
Lang’s 
dramatic 
works 
is of a woman as a catalyst 
for violence. Euripides’ play 
additionally draws attention to 
the way that Helen was reduced 
to a prop or a symbol in the 
course of the Trojan War — he 
has Menelaus appear in Egypt 
confused by the sight of his wife, 
as he thought he had captured 
her and hidden her in a cave. 
The Helen Menelaus captured 
turned out to be a phantom. 
In 
Carson’s 
retelling, 
this 
deception (and Helen’s absence 
from the site of the conflict) is 
played up — Norma Jeane is, 
instead of Egypt, in the Chateau 
Marmont to rehearse lines for 
“Clash By Night,” waiting for 
her husband Arthur (Miller; 
described here, clumsily, as 
“King of Sparta and New York”) 
and worrying after her daughter 

Hermione, who she sets out to 
meet at the end.
If this sounds convoluted, it’s 
because it is. One gets the sense 
here that there’s too much in the 
ancient and in the contemporary 
that aren’t effectively talking to 
each other, even if Carson’s aim 
is to make points about the most 
broad human themes possible — 
gender roles, war, storytelling. 
There’s an unsatisfying back-
and-forth 
between 
Carson’s 
muddled attempts to meld these 
disparate sources and her stark, 
generalized proclamations that 
don’t really end up contributing a 
whole lot of clarity or movement 
to the form of the whole. As I 
read, I kept asking myself why 
these historical scenarios were 
being brought together, what 
good it does. It doesn’t help 
that Carson frequently reaches 
for a sort of cheap timeliness — 
using the word “livestreaming” 
for the striking image from the 
Iliad of Helen sewing a tapestry 

depicting the carnage outside 
her window, putting a reference 
to fracking into the play that 
serves no real aesthetic or 

thematic purpose. The whole 
play has a slipshod quality to it, 
pieces never quite aligning the 

way you want them to. 
Carson’s interest in Ancient 
Greek as poetic material seems 
to be in its representative 
directness 
 
as 
opposed 
to 
modern languages — Greek 
represents, for her, a sort of 
symbolic bedrock for Western 
culture, and she is often most 
effective at her most rigorous 
exegetical 
mode 
(e.g. 
“Eros 
the Bittersweet,” “The Gender 
of Sound,” the notes for her 
Sappho translations). “Norma 
Jeane” feels markedly sloppier 
than this. It relies too much on 
the novelty, and doesn’t have the 
sharpness I usually associate 
with her work. It’s possible, 
in retrospect, that some of her 
other poetry traffics in this 
same vagueness — her poem 
“TV Men” from 1995 covers a lot 
of the same thematic ground — 
and this is just the first time it’s 
done too crudely, too obviously, 
with very little of her usual 
precise fire.

Anne Carson fans, prepare 
for a letdown with ‘Troy’

Justin Bieber released a love 
album on Valentine’s Day. There 
is, quite possibly, no better way 
to fall out of love with your 
significant other than listening to 
Changes.
It feels like a lifetime ago 
since The Biebs’s last album. The 
singles off of Purpose and their 
massive 
commercial 
success 
indicated that perhaps JB had 
more longevity than his boyish 
origins suggested. The smart 
thing to do — release something 
while the sea of relevance was still 
at high tide. Instead, he decided to 
come out with Changes five years 
later, to the interest of no one.
Supposedly, this album details 
the love story that led to Bieber’s 
recent 
marriage 
to 
Hailey 
Baldwin. Considering the last 
big release to address marriage 
(here’s to you Chance), it isn’t 
surprising that Changes at its best 
is uninspiring and at its worst 
makes a swift bid for the worst 
album of 2020.
To start with, there is a serious 
question to be asked about how 
Justin views love. This album 
depicts it as robotic. It feels like an 
unending string of procedurally 
generated platitudes that lack any 
personality or insight into their 
actual relationship. Then there’s 
Justin’s idea of “spicing things 
up,” which is just Bieber adding 
in lyricisms along the lines of 
“Struck a match, you got me litty,” 
a line he thought was so clever he 
decided to use it again in another 

song (verbatim). Justin often 
reuses lines or ideas on Changes. 
How else does one reach their 
goal of 17 songs and nearly an hour 
of material? 
The worst part: The most 
memorable lines on the album 
are 
the 
most 
problematic. 
Typically these lines fall into 
two 
categories: 
uncomfortable 
information about his sex life 
and 
hopefully 
unintentional 
misogyny. Examples of the former 
can be found in lyrics like, “Fully 
committed, you’re here for the stay 

down / Look in the mirror, you’re 
right for the take down.” Literally 
within the first six lines of the 
album, we already have Justin 
looking like a predator. This type 
of highly questionable insinuation 
finds itself on nearly every song in 
some form or fashion. The latter 
category can be boiled down 
to one line: “Stay in the kitchen 
cookin’ up, got your own bread.” 
If it was just a blanket sexist 
statement then that’s one thing, 
but the fact that he was trying to 
use the line as an empowering 
symbol for his woman shows an 
almost unparalleled level of tone-

deafness. Seriously, how many 
people have heard this line before 
the album was dropped? 100? 150? 
That means there exists at least 
that many people with the same 
amount of ignorance.
Musically, things aren’t much 
better. Sure, the production is 
overall inoffensive, but that just 
makes things boring. There are 
a few songs like “Habitual” and 
“Available” that have something 
slightly 
interesting 
going 
on 
underneath, but then are sullied 
by bland trap beats. There are 
trap beats on nearly every song 
of the album, making everything 
sound similar; the beats are used 
as a crutch for bad songwriting. 
The vapidness of this album 
cannot be overstated. It got to a 
point where a Lil Dicky feature 
actually seemed enticing if only to 
appreciate the trainwreck.
Perhaps the biggest problem 
with Changes is that it doesn’t even 
play the role of an awful album 
well. At least with Corey Feldman 
or Speedin’ Bullet to Heaven it feels 
like an event when you decide to 
listen to them. Speedin’ Bullet also 
saw Kid Cudi experimenting with 
his sound. It didn’t pay off at all, 
but at least it showed some type 
of artistic earnesty. Changes has 
none of this. It is as basic as basic 
can be and feels less like art and 
more like advertisement. That’s 
basically what this album is, an 
ad for other artists to see he’s 
available for collaborations. In 
fact, collaborations were the only 
thing keeping him relevant in that 
five-year span of time. Perhaps 
he should stick to what he’s best 
at: flaunting his ass as a cartoon 
baboon for a Lil Dicky song.

ALBUM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

“Body music” is what Ralf Hütter 
of the pioneering German electronic 
music group Kraftwerk called their 
1978 album The Man Machine. 
While not the most reflective 
example of Electronic Body Music 
(EBM), it does share the confusing 
mix of qualities that make EBM so 
enticing. Not nearly as groovy as 
house, not nearly as rigid as techno, 
EBM straddled the line between 
the danceable and the experimental 
and while it laid low after its heyday 
in the 1980s, it’s making a bit of a 
comeback.
The roots of the genre can be 
traced back to Kraftwerk of course, 
as well as another German band DAF 
(short for Deutsche Amerikanische 
Freundschaft). Their most iconic 
album, the 1981 release Alles Ist Gut, 
is a classic example of the rather 
dirty, grimy yet somewhat sensual 
sound that characterizes the genre. 
For the most part, the sound on cuts 
like “Der Mussolini” and “Alle Gegen 
Alle” are relatively simple in terms 
of arrangement, with very precise, 
metronomic drums and catchy synth 
riffs. The most enticing part of these 
tracks (as well as most on the album) 
is Gabi Delgado’s deep, powerful 
incantation-like 
vocals. 
Delgado, 
the son of Spanish immigrants, 
also flirts ironically and in a way, 
reclaims Fascist imagery (as in the 
aforementioned “Der Mussolini”), 
paving a way from the outset for a 
genre that is meant to be provocative 
and controversial.

Throughout the 1980s, labels in 
Germany and Belgium promoted 
body music throughout Europe, 
with groups heavily influenced 
by the aforementioned DAF, as 
well as equally provocative groups 
like Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb 
(many detailed histories may be 
found online). Its influences also 
spread halfway across the world to 
Australia, in particular to a Sydney-
based band called Severed Heads. 
The group was a pioneer in its usage 

of tape looping and other sound-
generation techniques, combining 
their experimental streak with a 
talent for pop — the best example 
of which is their biggest hit, the 
1983 track “Dead Eyes Opened.” 
Originally a hastily added track to fill 
out a cassette, the single became an 
unlikely hit among non-commercial 
radio stations in Sydney. The track 
begins with a hypnotizing, if fairly 

standard 
electro-poppy 
synth 
pattern. Around a minute in, they 
incorporate a recording of a British 
crime journalist describing a brutal 
double murder, and about a minute 
later, the group incorporates a 
brutal set of industrial noises they 
are well-known for, creating a 
fascinating juxtaposition between 
the rather innocuous synth riff and 
the dissonant harsh sounds they 
introduce. The six-minute track 
feels five times its length, and while 
“Dead Eyes Opened” is not quite 
the best example of “pure” EBM, it 
achieves the main goal of the genre, 
to induce a hypnotic, primal trance.
While EBM died down slightly 
with the advent of other genres in 
the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, its sounds 
have again widely permeated techno 
and other more mainstream types 
of dance music in the last few years. 
Artists like Broken English Club (see 
“Plague Song”) and Phase Fatale 
have infused their techno with 
the characteristic “buzz” of body 
music to create a new and exciting 
hybrid. Frenchman Terence Fixmer 
has collaborated extensively with 
Nitzer Ebb’s Douglas McCarthy 
to create similarly EBM-infused 
techno, with the latter’s vocals on 
tracks like “Chemicals” adding 
that extra edge that harkens back 
to the genre’s heyday. Moreover, 
labels 
like 
the 
Berlin-based 
Aufnahme+Wiedergabe and Fleisch 
Records have led a renaissance of 
EBM in the country of its origins. 
Proof of the cyclical nature of dance 
music as well as the enduring appeal 
of the sounds and attitudes that EBM 
embodies, these artists and labels 
continue to push the genre forward 
for new audiences.

I have a confession to make: Last 
Friday was the first time I ever saw 
“Titanic.”
It was my first excursion on the 
RMS Titanic with ’90s Leonardo 
DiCaprio (“Inception”) and Kate 
Winslet (“Eternal Sunshine of the 
Spotless Mind”) in all their glory. 
It was the first time I ever saw Jack 
and Rose dance below deck, talk 
about their future together and spit 
over the railings. It was the first 
time I saw That Sunset Scene (you 
know which one I’m talking about). 
It was the first time I had ever 
heard Rose in the future recount a 
tragedy that none of her listeners 
could really grasp the severity of — 
and I don’t just mean Brock Lovett 
(Bill Paxton, “Aliens”) or Lewis 
Bodine (Lewis Abernathy, “The 
Name of God”). I mean us viewers 
in the audience, too. It was the first 
time I saw the Titanic sink. It was 
the first time I really understood 
why it hurt so much that the raft 
wasn’t big enough. It was the first 
time I heard “My Heart Will Go 
On” in its original context. 
I saw “Titanic” on Valentine’s 
Day, surrounded by elderly couples 
with their arms wound tightly 
around each other, crying quietly 
as Jack and Rose promised to never 

let go. As I watched the film, the 
coughs, sneezes and sniffles of 
Michigan in February faded away, 
and I found myself immersed 
in 1912 aboard the Titanic with 
characters I had heard about all my 
life but never really known. 
I knew the story, of course — or 
at least I thought I did. Jack. Rose. 
“I’m the king of the world!” The 
raft isn’t big enough. “My Heart 
Will Go On.” Screen fades to black. 
As it turns out, there is much, much 
more to this movie than I had 
thought. I didn’t really know the 
story until I watched it. 
There are some moments in 
movies that were surprising when 
they were first released, but as 
someone born in 2001, I grew up 
knowing my whole life. Darth 
Vader is Luke’s father. Haley Joel 
Osment could actually see dead 
people. And Jack Dawson dies. 
But here’s the thing. Tragedy 
is horrific when it takes you by 
surprise, but it’s worse when 
you 
know 
it’s 
coming. 
You 
watch “Titanic” and take in the 
extravagance of the beautiful ship 
with not enough lifeboats, knowing 
that it’s going to sink. You smile 
from your seat as you watch Jack 
and Rose fall in love, but your smile 
fades when you remember that 
their ending isn’t happily ever after. 
You see them, holding each others’ 
hands tightly as Rose lays on the 
raft and Jack remains afloat beside 
her, and can’t help but think maybe 

this one time I watch this movie, 
it won’t have the ending I know it 
will. But it does.
Last Friday was the first time 
I cried while watching “Titanic,” 
surrounded 
by 
other 
people 
saddened 
on 
Valentine’s 
Day, 
choosing to spend it crying on their 
partner’s shoulder (or in my case, 
my roommate Sophia’s). 
“Titanic” has always been one 
of those movies I never really 
thought I had to see. The ending 
wasn’t predictable, per se, but it 
was common knowledge. So I 
figured, why watch this sad movie 
with an ending I already know? 
Here’s why: “Titanic” teaches you 
something. Not about falling in love 
in three days or about spitting in 
Billy Zane’s (“The Phantom”) face. 
Not even about the Titanic sinking. 
It teaches you something about the 
people around you, the people you 
watch the movie with. That they’re 
important to you in a way that you 
can only understand when you’re 
reminded of just how short life 
is. It teaches you to never let go of 
them. It reminds everyone of their 
personal love story, not necessarily 
one of romance. Perhaps it’s 
familial, like Rose and her mother’s 
tragic relationship. Or maybe it’s 
friendship, like Jack and Fabrizio 
(Danny Nucci, “Crimson Tide”). 
Or maybe it is love. Whatever it is, 
“Titanic” reminds you to cherish it 
and remember how important it is 
to you before it’s too late. 

Love of ‘Titanic’ will go on

The 
opening 
scene 
of 
“Clemency” is an execution. A 
group of people gather around 
a prisoner as a medical worker 
places the IV into his veins that will 
deliver fatal drugs to his system. 
The room’s atmosphere is solemn 
and emotionless, but there is also 
a sense of urgency, a need to get it 
over with. The ticking of the clock is 
intertwined with the beeping heart 
monitor as the people standing 
around the prisoner wait for his 
death to be official.
This is the reality of Warden 
Bernadine 
Williams 
(Alfre 
Woodard, “Miss Evers’ Boys”), who 
oversees the executions of prisoners 
on death row. Williams has thrown 
herself into a routine when it comes 
to carrying out the death penalty 
to keep herself detached: using 
clinical terms like “procedure” to 
refer to executions, avoiding direct 
connections with inmates and not 
making any exceptions when it 
comes to protocol. Yet, when the 
opening execution does not go as 
planned, the warden’s routine is 
shaken, forcing her to confront the 
reality of her profession. Writer 

and director Chinonye Chukwu 
(“Alaska-land”) brings us this dark 
drama not just to tell us a sad story, 
but to give us a window into a reality 
that is present today, a glimpse into 
the feelings of helplessness that 
percolate within the people who 
carry out this process.
The audience is given little time 
to recover from the first execution 
before we move on to another one 

— that of Anthony Woods (Aldis 
Hodge, “Straight Outta Compton”), 
a prisoner on death row who was 
convicted of murdering a police 
officer. Despite media attention, 
the ambiguity surrounding his 
crime and the tireless efforts of his 
defense lawyer, Marty Lumetta 
(Richard 
Schiff, 
“The 
West 
Wing”), Woods’s execution seems 
inevitable. The only hope he can 

cling to is a chance for clemency 
— pardoning a criminal of capital 
punishment — from the governor.
While the pacing is erratic at 
times, its somewhat lengthy quality 
feels true to life, as the legal process 
is often slow and arduous. As the 
lingering emotional effects of these 
executions impact everyone in the 
prison, characters have different 
responses. Woods shuts down, 
becoming despondent over his 
impending death. Lumetta, despite 
many years as an attorney, plans to 
retire after Woods’s case, unable 
to find hope in other people’s 
decisions and inevitably watch 
another 
client 
die. 
Williams’s 
husband, 
Jonathan 
(Wendell 
Pierce, “Selma”), struggles to deal 
with his wife’s quiet despair as 
she becomes a shell of herself, her 
mental health becoming paper-thin 
over time. While off-duty, Warden 
Williams deals with her internal 
struggle by drinking excessively 
and sinking into herself, kept up 
at night by nightmares. But as 
soon as she returns to the prison, 
she resumes her impassive front, 
distress seen only through the 
small breaks in her façade: a twitch 
of the lip, an unfocused gaze, or the 
hint of a bitter tone in her words.

 What started as an average loose ball 
became anything but. 
 Jon Teske might’ve just missed a 
point-blank layup attempt, but he 
wasn’t going to give up on the play. 
As the rebound evaded the grasp of 
the Hoosiers, the senior center dove 
on it and had the wherewithal to find 
Franz Wagner alone under the basket 
for two. 
 Teske’s effort, apart from send-
ing the Crisler Center crowd into 
an uproar, capped off an offensive 
onslaught that saw his team take a 
12-point lead on Indiana late in the 
first half. 
 From there, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team (16-9 overall, 7-7 Big 

Ten) held serve to beat the Hoosiers 
(16-9, 6-8), 89-65, Sunday afternoon.
 It didn’t take long for each offense 
to get going. Collective scoring from 
the Wolverines and a quick pair of 
triples from Indiana’s Al Durham led 
to a 12-11 scoreline by the under-16 
timeout, with Indiana holding the 
slim advantage.
 The floodgates were open and 
Michigan wasn’t too keen on closing 
them. Behind a barrage of 3-point-
ers, senior guard Zavier Simpson 
dropping dimes — he had six assists 
in the opening 20 minutes — and 
senior center Austin Davis cleaning 
up the offensive boards, Michigan 
took control.
 Despite being traditionally thought 
of as Teske’s backup, the big man’s 
recent performances have blurred 
those lines, with both players receiv-
ing similar minutes in the first half. 

 “Austin is wired the right way,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard said. 
“He’s a total team guy. He’s never 
tried to go for his numbers or do 
things that he’s not good at. He comes 
in with the right attitude in practice 
and working hard. He’s buying into 
the teaching and development, and 
he’s going out there and having a 
great carryover game after game.”
 Even more offensive production 
from the Wolverines gave Michigan 
a 41-34 cushion going into the break, 
with junior forward Isaiah Livers 
leading the way with nine points. 
 And that cushion only grew in the 
second half. Wagner chipped in five 
quick points out of the break, de-
lighting his brother, former Michigan 
standout and current Washington 
Wizard Moritz Wagner, sitting 
courtside.
 Simpson continued to spread the 

wealth offensively, ultimately finish-
ing with 11 assists. 
 “(Zavier) did a really good job 
controlling the tempo of the game,” 
Howard said. “He was hunting for 
singles. He wasn’t trying to make the 
home-run play — finding guys that 
were open and being patient with the 
basketball.”
 What was a refreshingly comfort-
able half for Michigan could only 
be tarnished by the sight of Livers 
hobbling to the bench after falling 
out of bounds. Sunday marked Livers’ 
third game back from a re-aggravated 
groin injury suffered against Illinois 
on Jan. 25.
 After missing just six minutes of 
game time, though, Livers checked 
back in at the 7:54 mark — not that 
the Wolverines particularly needed 
him at that point, up by 19 — and 
played through a limp. Howard 

described his status as day-to-day 
afterwards, and Livers is currently 
in a boot with what appears to be an 
ankle injury. 
 In the end, Michigan handled its 
business with relative ease. Six Wol-
verines scored in double digits, with 
Wagner leading the way with 16. The 
balance and confidence on display 
more resembled the Michigan squad 
that knocked off No. 2 Gonzaga in 
November than the one that lost five 
of six Big Ten games to begin January. 
 “I feel like we’re back in the 
beginning of the year a little bit,” 
sophomore forward Brandon Johns 
Jr. said. “We’re all just so connected, 
trusting each other and knocking 
down shots.”
 In similar fashion to recent versions 
of the Wolverines, Michigan seems to 
be gaining momentum when it mat-
ters most — heading into March.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In 2017, just after Mel Pearson was 
hired as the Michigan hockey coach, he 
went to Red Berenson’s house and had 
what he called the best conversation of 
his life. 
The two sat on the deck in Beren-
son’s backyard and talked for two 
hours, about anything and 
everything. It was a beauti-
ful night, Pearson recalled, 
and they sipped drinks. 
A weight appeared to be 
lifted off Berenson’s shoul-
ders. “After all those years 
of hockey, I think he just 
finally relaxed,” Pearson 
said this Wednesday.
For years, when Pear-
son worked under Beren-
son as an assistant coach, 
he had seen him in the 
crucible, up close. They had 
coached Michigan to 10 Fro-
zen Fours and two national 
titles together before Pearson 
left in 2011 to coach Michigan 
Tech. Berenson would stay in 
his job until he was 77 years 
old, finishing his career with a 
13-19-1 season, his worst since 
his first year behind the bench, 
back in 1985.
There’s always a conflict in 
coaching. Be it recruiting, on-ice 
performance, an off-ice issue 
or something else entirely — it 
always comes back to the head 
coach. For 33 years, it always came 
back to Berenson.
All that was over now.
A few hours before Pearson 
recalled that conversation, Beren-
son sat at a desk in his Weiden-
bach Hall office, talking about a 
packed schedule.
The night before, he’d played 
hockey with the Michigan 
alumni team at Yost Ice Arena, 
on the rink with his name 
inscribed on it, like he does 
every Tuesday. On Wednesday 
night, he planned to go to a 
high school hockey game to 
see one of his grandkids. On 
Saturday, he’d play another 
game in Howell, with the Red 
Wing alumni team. On Mon-
day night, he’ll be in Detroit to 
watch Michigan play Michigan 
State.
Michigan didn’t play at Yost 
this weekend, but at home games, 
Berenson sits in the athletic 
director’s box now, entertaining 
donors or merely spending time 
with his wife, Joy. He still feels 
pulled toward the ice.
He was asked if it was nice to 
have the stress off him without 
coaching — without being in con-
stant conflict.
“Well, it was fine and I have no 
regrets,” Berenson said. “So it was 
good.” Then he moved into talking 
about how he still feels invested in 
the team. Really, the question went 
unanswered.
He holds a job in the ath-
letic department, helping endow 
scholarships in the hockey 
program — a project he started 
back in the late-1990s when 
Tom Goss was the athletic 
director. He’s close to finishing. 
To some extent, he’s relaxed 
more, but the Berenson who 
Pearson saw that night three 
years ago, after officially 
handing off a job synony-
mous with his name for three 
decades, hasn’t moved away 
from everything, at least not com-
pletely. Pearson notices the com-
petitiveness simmering beneath 
the surface, calm but clear.
“I don’t feel like I’m not in hock-
ey anymore,” Berenson said.
***
For years when Berenson 
coached, he preached the idea 
of a life after hockey. He was 
born in 1939, near the end of the 

Great Depression and he says his parents’ 
culture “was just survival.” Berenson 
inherited that. And wanted to get away 
from it.
In an age where education was 
frowned upon in some hockey circles, 
Berenson went to college, choosing 
Michigan over Denver because, he said, 
“some of the guys that went to Denver, I 
just didn’t have a lot of respect for them 
as students.” Years later, he completed an 
MBA, driving back to Ann Arbor for class 
the day after the Canadiens’ Stanley Cup 
celebration parade in 1965. While hockey 
players drank in the locker rooms, Beren-
son quit an offseason office job at Molson 
Breweries because there was too much 
drinking. He wore a helmet when doing 
so carried a stigma.
Berenson played for 17 seasons, 
coached in the NHL for six, then in col-
lege for 33. The last three years have been 
the closest thing to a life after hockey 
he’s had, yet last week he found himself 
at a hockey rink nearly every day, eating 
popcorn and watching Michigan practice 
from a seat in the corner of Yost.
“I came back here and I had no idea 
I’d be here 30-something years, but it 
just worked out that way,” Berenson said. 
“While I’ve been here, I’ve been able 
to digest that feeling that this life after 
hockey has already started, but I’m right 
in the middle of hockey.”
This year, Berenson plans to get away 
from everything the same way he has 
for the last 50 years. He’ll get a group 
of friends together, pack up the car and 
drive north. They’ll spend 7-10 days in 
canoes, portaging rapids they can’t make 
it through and camping at night, isolated 
from the rest of the world.
In an office filled with reminders of 
his hockey achievements, Berenson’s 
favorite photo is of himself, shirtless 
and bearded, wearing sunglasses and 
standing in a canoe on the Missinaibi 
River. He picked up the hobby while he 
played, discovering he had an interest in 
the outdoors and, during the offseason, 
real time on his hands to explore it. The 
physicality of it appeals to him. So does 
the remoteness.
He did it with the same group of three 
or four friends for years, and as a coach, 
he used to invite graduating seniors as 
well, using it as a bonding event. 
One year, when current Michigan 
assistant Bill Muckalt went, his canoe 
partner, Deke, tore his Achilles. There 
was no discussion of cutting the trip 
short. On the last day, Muckalt recalled, 
Berenson paddled off into the Lake 
Superior sunset. “I’m with Deke like, ‘If 
we dump this canoe, we’re dead.’ Cause 
the water’s freezing,” Muckalt said. Still, 
they made it through each day, setting 
up camp and listening to the Stanley Cup 
Finals on the radio at night.
“That’s the worst real injury that 
we’ve had,” Berenson said. “And yet it 
wasn’t life-threatening. It was just, it was 
inconvenient.”
He’s not looking for overly tough trips 
anymore. Last year, the wind was in his 
face the whole time and there were too 
many portages. Some of the mainstays 
who did the trips for years have dropped 
off. Last year, Kent Brothers, an ex-player 
who went on a trip nearly three decades 
ago after graduating, called Berenson 
out of the blue and asked to go again. 
They loved having him. Berenson doesn’t 
reach out to players each year anymore, 
though. At some point, they didn’t seem 
interested in something like that. “They 
know that I go and if they want to go, 
they can call,” Berenson said.
Two Saturdays ago, Luke Glenden-
ing came back to Yost to visit. His career 
embodies the traits Berenson values, 
the ones he saw less and less of as time 
passed by.
Glendening came to Michigan in 
2008, recruited as a walk-on. He played 
four years, earning a degree and getting 
good enough to earn an NHL spot as an 
undrafted free agent. He’s in his seventh 
year with the Detroit Red Wings now, 
but when his career ends, he’ll have a 
degree to fall back on.
Berenson paints Glendening in con-
trast with Josh Norris, another former 
Michigan player who left after last sea-
son, as a sophomore. He’s with the AHL’s 

Belleville Senators now, a minor-league 
affiliate of Ottawa. Berenson doesn’t 
understand why.
“Now, he’s probably happy in the 
minors,” Berenson said. “But as an advi-
sor and his coach, I would’ve said, you’ll 
get to the NHL just as fast by staying in 
school. ... You don’t know how long you’re 
gonna play hockey.”
Norris never played for Berenson, 
though he was recruited by him. But the 
old coach sees him as a part of a trend, 
ever-growing, that started in the mid-
2000s, when certain players started to 
come to Michigan thinking they had it 
figured out. A recruit named Steve Guolla 
once asked Berenson if he could wait on 
a decision after being offered. Berenson 
rescinded the offer, making the decision 
for him. He wanted a group of four-year 
players who wanted nothing more than 
to be in Ann Arbor, lining up behind 
each other for playing time. Things were 
regimented, just the way Berenson, an 
old-school coach who comes from an old-
school background, wanted them.
Unmistakably, Berenson is a man of 
his age, both in how he handled his pro-
gram and in his personal life. He keeps 
things to himself. 
When Pearson’s father passed away, 
he found a photo of him and Berenson 
together, on an All-Star team in Hum-
boldt, Saskatchewan in the late-1950s. 
Berenson had told Pearson he knew his 
father. Neither man had said anything to 
Pearson about having played together.
***
The current senior class is Berenson’s 
last. 
Once they graduate, there will be no 
one left on Michigan’s roster who played 
for him, only those he recruited and 
called after the 2017 season, telling them 
he wouldn’t be there.
He’ll lose something in that — it’s easy 
to pick up on the way Berenson speaks 
about his former players. He watches the 
NHL constantly, and it’s hard to believe 
he isn’t doing that to keep an eye on 
them. Last week, he came into the Yost 
offices and asked Pearson if he knew 
Andrew Cogliano would play his 1,000th 
NHL game on Thursday. Pearson had no 
idea. But Berenson keeps up with these 
things.
The last players with ties to his reign 
leaving won’t end the connection Beren-
son feels with the program. Pearson, 
Muckalt, volunteer assistant Matt Hun-
wick and player development coach Steve 
Shields all played or coached under him. 
When Pearson brings recruits in now, he 
tries to make sure they meet Berenson.
He still comes into the offices to talk 
a couple times a week, meeting with the 
coaches or just with Pearson in an unof-
ficial advisoral capacity. Once in a long 
while, he’ll talk to Pearson after a game. 
No one feels he’s stepping on toes — the 
staff values any advice he has, and he 
doesn’t want to overstep. When Pearson 
took over, he made sure there was still a 
stall for him in the coach’s locker room.
“He’s got such a good way about him,” 
Pearson said. “Not forcing or telling you 
anything to do. You just start talking 
about something and then you get into 
some coaching or maybe a player, or if 
you have a discipline issue, or maybe a 
player isn’t playing up to their potential 
or whatnot, how you deal with it.”
As for his current role, Berenson is 
unsure when he’ll leave it.
“Year to year, I don’t have a plan,” 
Berenson said. “As long as I’m healthy 
and fit and alert, if it works for Warde, 
and if it doesn’t work for him, I’m fine. I’ll 
be fine without this. But I’ll still be a fan.”
Even though his passion for hockey 
is as strong as ever, Berenson relishes 
having more time to spend with his fam-
ily now. He and Joy have always done 
trips in their AirStream, driving across 
Canada to visit family, and that hasn’t 
changed. Last summer, to celebrate their 
60th anniversary, the family got together 
and stayed at the Grand Hotel on Macki-
nac Island.
The island is remote and isolated, the 
way Berenson likes it. There are no cars 
— just bikes and horses to get around — 
and the whole family was there, as far 
removed from the hockey world as could 
be.

Simpson stars as ‘M’ beats Indiana 

Zavier Simpson took the ball 
up the court to kick things off 
against Indiana on Sunday.
But, 
fairly 
uncharacteristically, Simpson 
attempted to find his man on 
the right side only to see the 
ball land squarely in the hands 
of a Hoosier. Rather than 
follow up Indiana’s opening 
bucket with a couple points of 
his own, Simpson was staring 
down a turnover and a less-
than-ideal start.
But that would be one of his 
only mistakes all afternoon.
Over the next 40 minutes, 
Simpson turned in one of his 
strongest performances of the 
season on the way to 12 points 
and 11 assists. All Sunday 
afternoon, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense fired on all cylinders 
and showed its ceiling on 
nearly every possession — and 
it almost all involved No. 3 en 
route to a 89-65 win.
One look at the stat sheet will 
quickly reveal the benefactors 
of 
Simpson’s 
efforts 
distributing 
the 
ball. 
His 
presence as the floor general 
lends itself to a balanced box 
score with as many as five 
players scoring double digits — 
as was the case on Sunday.
Perhaps the most obvious 
benefactor 
of 
Simpson’s 

elevated play was freshman 
forward Franz Wagner, who 
notched a team-high 16 for 
Michigan, 
many 
of 
which 
came directly from Simpson’s 
fingertips. 
But 
Simpson 
has 
played 
plenty of games with Wagner 
this season, so what made this 
go-around so different?
“I think a lot of stuff 
has to do with our off-ball 
movement,” 
Wagner 
said. 
“Because if two guys off the 
ball are just standing around, it 
makes it easy for one guy to be 
lower and one guy just staying 
at the top and just hooking 
everything up, so when he 
has the opportunity to get 
downhill, be aggressive, people 
are gonna collapse. 
“He’s a good player, and 
that’s when he’s at his best, 
making decisions with the ball, 
finding open guys and we can 
score from there.”
As the game progressed, it 
became increasingly obvious 
just how easily Simpson was 
able to score on the Indiana 
defense. Two points off the 
pick-and-roll 
became 
the 
expectation 
rather 
than 
a 
shock at how well the offense 
was clicking.
Simpson’s role in Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard’s offense, 
though, may at first glance 
seem a bit baffling.
The 
first-year 
coach 

has 
made 
his 
philosophy 
abundantly clear: If you’re 
open, let it fly. And any offense 
for the Wolverines that relies 
on Simpson to let it fly is surely 
in for some rough games.
But 
in 
Howard’s 
words, 
Simpson makes teams die by 
a thousand cuts rather than 
by volume shooting from the 
perimeter. So when his game is 
on, he allows others to take the 
oh-so coveted open shot.
“He 
made 
some 
great 
decisions with the basketball,” 
Howard said. “He did a really 
good job of controlling the 
tempo of the game. One thing 
that was critical with him was 
his decision making and that 
he was hunting for singles. 
He wasn’t trying to make the 
home-run play. Finding guys 
who were open, being patient 
with the basketball, reading 
what the defense gives him.”
Earlier in the season, it 
wasn’t always the case that 
Simpson’s 
prolific 
passing 
ability 
led 
to 
knock-down 
jumpers from the likes of 
Wagner, sophomore forward 
Brandon Johns Jr. and others. 
Rather, Michigan often found 
itself in stretches — or entire 
games 
— 
of 
debilitatingly 
stagnant shooting. Wide-open 
looks haunted the Wolverines 
as they attempted to get back a 
semblance of the fun they were 
having when they cruised to an 
early-season tournament win 
in The Bahamas.
Simpson only collects 11 
assists Sunday if his teammates 
hit the shots the team’s leader 
creates. Wagner and Johns, for 
instance, have taken immense 
strides in being able to execute 
when it matters.
Simpson 
only 
had 
one 
noticeable 
mistake. 
One 
turnover. So when Michigan 
is pointing fingers over its 
stagnant offense or lack of 
emotion, you know Simpson 
is most likely doing his part — 
and it’s going to be damn-near 
perfect.

Wolverines blasted by Rutgers, 62-41

Down by eight with under 
10 seconds remaining in the 
second quarter of Sunday’s 
game, senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson drove down the right 
side of the key, looking to cut 
into Rutgers’ lead. 
After 
an 
abysmal 
first 
offensive half, a bucket would 
send the Wolverines to the 
locker room at the Rutgers 
Athletic Center down by just 
six, with an opportunity to 
regroup and come out more 
motivated in the third quarter. 
But in came Mael Gilles. 
The Scarlet Knights’ forward 
swiped the ball away and found 
guard 
Arella 
Guirantes 
in 
transition, who drew a foul on 
Johnson and made one of two 
free throws. Though the play 
didn’t end Michigan’s chances 
of a comeback, it was indicative 
of the shorthanded Wolverines’ 
offensive struggles throughout 
Sunday’s game. 
Rutgers dominated, 62-41, 
thanks to its stifling defense 
and 
Michigan’s 
sloppy, 
turnover-prone 
offense 
— 
especially in the first half. 
“That was the difference 
obviously early on when they 
got the lead in the first half,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“(It 
was) 
our 
turnovers, and our turnovers 
were leading to easy buckets, 
and I felt like they only really 
scored on our turnovers early. 
… They had 12 points off of 
them at half.”
In 
recent 
games, 
the 
Wolverines had been fairly 
successful on offense, thanks 
to a versatile high-low attack 
between sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon and the team’s 
outside shooters. It featured 
a pretty simple formula: Feed 
Hillmon in the paint, draw 
double-teams and kick it out 
to the open player. Often, 
Hillmon was so effective that 
she could score against the 

double-team anyway. 
That just wasn’t working on 
Sunday. With Hillmon limited 
after 
suffering 
an 
upper-
body injury Thursday against 
Northwestern, the Wolverines’ 
offense stagnated. She was 
held to just five points — her 
lowest total all season — and 
Michigan in turn scored its 
lowest total since March 2013, 
when it tallied just 40 points 
in the final game of Barnes 
Arico’s first season.
“I 
think, 
as 
much 
as 
(Hillmon) was out there at 
times — and she did try her 
hardest and did her best — you 
know she’s not herself,” Barnes 
Arico said. “You can tell she’s 
in pain, and you can tell she 
tried to go out there and do 
everything she could to help 
us be successful today, but she 
didn’t have that same smile on 
her face, and the same energy 
that she does on a regular 
basis.”
After a slow first half, the 
Scarlet Knights’ offense found 
its rhythm in the second half. 
Guirantes 
— 
their 
leading 
scorer — led this attack, hitting 
jumpers from everywhere en 
route to a 15-point second half. 
She finished the game with 24 
points. 
Meanwhile, 
without 
Hillmon’s normally dominant 
production, 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled 
to 
get 
anything 
from inside. Attempts to drive 
to the basket often ended in 
forced passes and turnovers, 
and the few inside shots they 
did get up were either blocked 
or rimmed out. Rutgers tallied 
nine blocks on the game, and 
Michigan went a poor 10-for-
26 on layups. 
“The RAC — and I’ve played 
here a lot … it’s an incredibly 
difficult place to play,” Barnes 
Arico said. “And Rutgers at 
home is very different than 
Rutgers on the road, and I 
think the physicality kind of 
took us out of what we wanted 
to do early.
“ ... I’m not really making 
excuses, we obviously know 
that we have got to get better, 
but this has been a little bit of 
a stretch for us in terms of, you 
know, the games we’ve been 
playing in this short period 
of time, with the turnaround, 
with the injuries added to 
that.”
Sunday’s 
loss 
was 
the 
toughest 
part 
of 
a 
brutal 
stretch 
on 
the 
Wolverines 
schedule — their third game in 
just seven days. With their best 
player not at 100 percent and 
just nine healthy players on the 
roster, a loss shouldn’t come as 
too much of a surprise. 
But the way it happened 
doesn’t bode well.

Revival

EAST LANSING — Prior to 
Friday evening’s game, one might 
have thought goals would be 
hard to come by for the Michigan 
hockey team. 
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
mid-
November series against Michigan 
State, they got swept, going 
scoreless in the second game. 
And leading into Friday’s puck 
drop, Spartans’ goaltender John 
Lethemon boasted a .942 save 
percentage — the best in the nation.
But all that didn’t matter. 
Michigan’s 
offense 
thrived, 
helping the team run away with a 
5-1 victory against Michigan State 
(14-14-1 overall, 10-8-1 Big Ten).
“I’m not surprised,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said about 
scoring five on Lethemon. “I’m not 
surprised. We have guys who can 
put the puck in the net. We talked 
about, it’s been well-documented, 
our lack of scoring in the first 
half, but we weren’t healthy. Now 
we’re getting healthy. Some things 
are going in. We’re getting some 
confidence. We got a number of 
guys who can score, so I’m not 
surprised.”
This game meant a lot to 
Pearson. So much so that he 
brought his team up to East 
Lansing the night before. He 
wanted to make clear how much 
this game mattered and wanted 
his players in the best environment 
to excel.
“It’s always nice when you don’t 
have to travel on a game day,” 
senior forward Jake Slaker said. 
“We got to do all our pregame 
stuff here and could just focus. No 
distractions, and I think it worked 
out for us tonight.”
A few minutes into the first 
period, 
the 
Wolverines 
(14-
12-3, 9-8-2-1) started to spend 
considerable time in their own 
defensive zone. Some breakout 
struggles were apparent, as they 
had numerous turnovers.
But after a lengthy defensive 
stretch, Michigan caught a break. 
The team went on its first power 
play less than six minutes into 
the game, after forward Patrick 
Khodorenko 
got 
called 
for 

slashing. The Wolverines took that 
change of momentum and made 
the most of it.
Senior forward Will Lockwood 
got 
a 
pass 
from 
freshman 
defenseman Cam York by the left 
circle. He passed it to sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
in the high slot, who then sent it 
to the right circle where Slaker 
buried a one-timer 33 seconds into 
the power play.
“They haven’t given up a power 
play goal since I don’t know when,” 
Pearson said. “So we got off to a 
real good start.”
A 
couple 
minutes 
later, 
Michigan doubled its lead on the 
back of senior defenseman Luke 
Martin. York skated the puck 
behind Michigan State’s goal 
and soon connected with senior 
forward Nick Pastujov on the right 
side. Pastujov then swung the 
puck to the left circle, and Martin 
rocked a one-timer past Lethemon 
to make it 2-0. It was Martin’s first 
goal since his sophomore season 
and just the third of his career.
“It was nice to get the monkey 
off the back,” Martin said. “It was 
a great pass from Nick and a great 
play from Cam. It’s just nice to keep 
the momentum going and continue 
to keep our foot on the gas.”
The Wolverines received two 
more power plays in the opening 
frame, due to tripping and slashing 
calls. Unlike the opening power 
play, though, the Spartans killed 
both.
Michigan 
returned 
from 
intermission and matched its first 
period offensive production. 
It started 10 seconds after play 
resumed. Sophomore goaltender 
Strauss Mann settled the puck 
behind his net, then passed it along 
the boards to Martin. Martin then 
sent a long pass diagonally across 
center ice, and senior forward 
Jacob Hayhurst collected it just 
before his zone entry. Hayhurst 
then cut toward the net from the 
left side, brought the puck to his 
backhand and snuck it through 
Lethemon’s legs, giving Michigan 
a 3-0 lead and muting Munn Ice 
Arena.
And then with under eight 
to go in the second period, the 
Wolverines widened their lead to 

four goals. Junior forward Dakota 
Raabe got the puck near Michigan 
State’s goal and sent it to freshman 
defenseman Keaton Pehrson at the 
right side of the blue line. Pehrson 
slid the puck to his left. Sophomore 
defenseman Jack Summers took 
one touch to settle it, then rifled 
the puck into the bottom right 
corner.
Early in the final period, 
Michigan went on its first penalty 
kill of the night with York headed 
to the box for tripping. Finally 
getting the man advantage instead 
of giving it, the Spartans made the 
most of it. Nearing the end of the 
two minutes, defenseman Dennis 
Cesana passed to the crease from 
the right circle and forward Sam 
Saliba tapped it in to put the 
Spartans on the scoreboard.
With eight minutes left in 
the game, junior forward Luke 
Morgan fought for the puck at the 
left side of the crease and quickly 
passed it across to Slaker. Slaker 
capitalized, further fueling the 
momentous win and continuing 
the Wolverines’ streak in which 
they’ve now won 23 of the last 27 
conference points.
“We’ve got an energy with us 
right now,” Martin said. “Wouldn’t 
want to be the next team on our 
run.”

Michigan blows past Michigan State, 5-1, to earn 23 of 27 possible points since the New Year

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
Jake 
Slaker had just stopped in the 
left faceoff circle when he 
turned and saw a pass coming 
from Nick Blankenburg at the 
blueline.
That place in the circle has 
become the senior forward’s 
office on the power play lately, 
and this time, the pass found 
just the right spot. Slaker’s 
one-timer sent the puck off his 
stick and into the net before 
goaltender John Lethemon had 
a chance at stopping it.
For the second time in three 
games, 
Slaker 
opened 
the 
scoring on a power-play goal 
from the left circle. Friday, the 
goal came just six minutes into 
the game.
“We’ve 
been 
working 
on 
power play a lot lately,” Slaker 
said. “We’ve been up and down 
this whole season, so it was 
really huge to get a quick goal 
and then that just kinda kept the 
momentum going for the rest of 
the game.”
It was Slaker’s third goal in 
three games — and he added a 
fourth before the night was over.
Michigan held a 4-1 lead just 

over halfway through the third 
period, and Michigan State was 
largely carrying the momentum 
of the game. But then redshirt 
junior forward Luke Morgan 
found the puck in the slot in 
front of Lethemon, and Slaker 
saw an opportunity.
He slid down to the far post 
and yelled for the puck. Morgan 
slid it across, and Slaker’s quick 
wrister just beat a sprawling 
Lethemon.
“(Freshman 
forward 
Nick 
Granowicz) and Morgs were 
working so hard,” Slaker said. 
“I saw Morgs kinda get the 
puck and I was screaming at 
him as loud as I could (on the) 
backdoor. He threw the puck to 
me and luckily, it just went in for 
me.”
The goal extended Slaker’s 
streak of multi-point games 
to three and gave him his 
third two-goal game of the 
season. Since the Great Lakes 
Invitational in late December, 
Slaker has nine goals in 11 games 
— though he didn’t score until 
Nov. 23 and tallied just three 
goals in the first half of the 
season. After suffering an upper 
body injury against Western 
Michigan on Oct. 25 — the fifth 
game of the season — Slaker 

missed the next three games.
It took him some time to get 
his feet back under him, and the 
injury continued to nag at him 
for another few weeks once he 
came back. A two-week break 
at Christmas helped solidify the 
healing, and once the second 
half of the season started, Slaker 
took off.
“I think going into the break, 
maybe a few games before that, 
I started feeling that I was 
starting to get into the stride of 
the season,” Slaker said. “I think 
going into Christmas break, 
getting some rest and coming 
back fresh was really important 
for me.” 
Added Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson: “He’s healthy. The 
first half of the year, he was 
not healthy, and when you 
have these nagging injuries, he 
missed a number of games. But 
he knows how to score. He’s 
a gamer, like a number of our 
guys. But he’s a senior, too, and 
he wants to have his best year 
and he’s doing a heck of a job.”
Slaker’s current best season 
with the Wolverines came in his 
sophomore year, when he scored 
27 points in 40 games. This year, 
he’s got 23 through 26 games 
and has at least one point in 12 
of Michigan’s last 15 games.
As 
the 
Wolverines 
push 
into the last few games of the 
regular season, contributions 
from seniors like Slaker have 
been key in getting Michigan 
back in the win column after 
a rough first half. Pearson has 
spent most of the year talking 
about how the Wolverines need 
their seniors to contribute, and 
Slaker’s success has clearly been 
crucial in Michigan’s recent 
run.
His two goals in Friday’s 5-1 
win are just the most recent 
demonstration.
“I’m 
just 
playing 
with 
confidence right now, trying to 
do the little things,” Slaker said. 
“Just play well defensively, do 
all the little things, play physical 
and I’ll get my chances. Lately, 
they’ve been coming to me, and 
I’m just trying to take advantage 
of it.”

4B — February 17, 2020
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The 2020 season started 
the way the No. 8 Michigan 
baseball team (3-1) hoped the 
2019 season would end.
Trailing by one run in the 
top of the ninth inning, first 
baseman Matt Schmidt stepped 
up to the plate. For the fifth-
year senior, this opportunity 
had been a long time coming. 
In the first game of the 
season in a rematch against the 
defending national champions, 
the story wrote itself. But 
Schmidt wanted to write the 
ending.
Schmidt blasted a go-ahead, 
two-run home run off of one of 
the nation’s premiere closers 
to give the Wolverines a lead 
they wouldn’t relinquish en 
route to a 4-3 victory over No. 
1 Vanderbilt. 
“It was kind of a surreal 
experience,” 
Schmidt 
said. 
“We fought and competed and 
got the win against a good 
Vanderbilt team. ... It was kinda 

good to get revenge there.”
Michigan rounded out the 
MLB4 Collegiate Tournament 
in Scottsdale, Ariz., with wins 
over Cal Poly, 8-5, and No. 3 
Arizona State, 5-0, and a loss in 
its final game of the weekend 
against UConn, 7-1. 
On the pitching side in the 
opening game, junior right-
hander Jeff Criswell got the 
start and fifth-year senior left-
hander Benjamin Keizer earned 
the win. Keizer came out of 
the bullpen in the sixth inning 
and finished with 1.2 shutout 
innings and gave up no runs. 
The pitching drama was 
saved for redshirt sophomore 
right-hander 
Isaiah 
Paige. 
Paige entered in the ninth 
inning after Schmidt’s heroics 
put Michigan back on top. The 
final three outs proved to be 
the hardest of the night as Paige 
gave up a single and hit a pair of 
batters. Despite this, he didn’t 
allow any runs and earned the 
save. 
The first game against the 
Commodores 
to 
open 
the 
weekend garnered the most 

attention — and rightfully so — 
but the three remaining games 
provided insight into what the 
rest of the season might hold. 
“There 
were 
so 
many 
different breakout candidates 
that could be on the horizon,” 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
said. “Just guys 
that had their 
moments 
in 
different games 
that 
could 
be 
positive 
contributors 
for 
the 
entire 
season.”
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
second 
game 
of the weekend 
against Cal Poly, 
junior 
right-
hander 
Blake 
Beers, with the 
help of strong 
infield defensive 
play, didn’t allow a baserunner 
until the bottom of the fourth 
inning. Beers earned the win 
with no earned runs and just 
four hits. 

The 
top 
of 
the 
batting 
order provided strong hitting 
with three base hits from 
junior outfielder and leadoff 
hitter Jordan Nwogu. Junior 
shortstop Jack Blomgren added 
four hits of his own, helping 
Michigan to an 8-5 win.
Down 
the 
stretch 
of 
the 
game, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense started 
to 
become 
a 
little 
sloppy 
and 
allowed 
several 
extra 
bases. 
Bakich 
thought 
the 
game could have 
easily gotten out 
of 
hand 
with 
all 
the 
added 
baserunners, but 
freshman right-
hander Cameron 
Weston 
came 
out of the bullpen to earn his 
first career save. 
After 
its 
win 
over 
the 
Mustangs, 
Michigan 
immediately boarded the bus 

to head to Phoenix Municipal 
Stadium for its third game of 
the weekend, against Arizona 
State — an added game that only 
made the Wolverines’ weekend 
tougher.
The situation wasn’t the most 
conducive 
environment 
for 
redshirt freshman left-hander 
Steven Hajjar to start his first 
career game. But Hajjar took 
the game in stride, getting more 
comfortable as the innings 
went on and earning his first 
career win in the 5-0 victory. 
He pitched six innings with just 
three hits and seven strikeouts. 
In 
arguably 
its 
most 
impressive win of the weekend, 
Michigan 
looked 
toward 
players on last year’s bench. 
Sophomore left-hander Jack 
White pitched three scoreless 
innings in the relief effort. 
Senior pinch hitter Dominic 
Clementi provided the final 
boost for Michigan when he hit 
a two-run double in the ninth 
inning. 
“New guys stepping up, I 
think that was kind of the 
storyline throughout the entire 

weekend,” Criswell said. 
The Wolverines played their 
final, 
most 
physcially 
and 
mentally tough game against 
UConn. The Huskies scored 
first in the first inning and, 
despite a small rally in the 
fourth inning led by Nwogu 
and redshirt sophomore Danny 
Zimmerman, 
they 
wouldn’t 
relinquish their lead, as the 
Wolverines fell, 7-1. 
“This game was a learning 
lesson,” Bakich said. “It was 
good for them to experience 
how they felt being emotionally 
drained and physically drained 
and still try to have to compete 
with that, cause that’s how it’s 
going to feel months from now.”
Ultimately, 
Michigan 
finished its opening weekend 
3-1, including two wins over top 
ranked teams in the country. 
“I think we knew going into 
the weekend, if we came out of 
this thing 4-0 we’re probably 
not as good as it seems,” Bakich 
said. “If we came out 0-4 we’re 
not as bad as we seem. (There 
were a) lot of takeaways of 
growth opportunities.”

Lauren Esman wasted no time. 
Pinch-hitting 
in 
the 
sixth 
inning with the bases loaded 
and the score tied, the freshman 
utility player belted the first pitch 
she saw from Louisville’s Taylor 
Roby over the right-center field 
fence for a go-ahead grand slam. 
Esman’s heroics sealed an 8-4 
win for No. 11 Michigan softball 
(9-0) 
over 
Louisville 
(2-7), 
capping off a weekend sweep that 
also included a 6-2 win over the 
Cardinals and 4-3 and 4-0 wins 
over No. 25 North Carolina (5-5) 
in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge. 

“I was just ‘see ball, hit ball,’ 
that was my mentality,” Esman 
said. “Just attack early. I knew 
I needed to score some runs 
because it was a tie ballgame, so 
I was just trying to hit it to the 
right side. It just happened to go 
out.”
Prior 
to 
taking 
the 
lead, 
the Wolverines had to claw 
themselves out of a 3-1 hole, 
their first and only deficit of the 
weekend. In its first turn at bat 
after Louisville took the lead, 
Michigan 
answered. 
Senior 
outfielder Thais Gonzalez drove 
in a run with a single to right field 
and junior infielder Taylor Bump 
blasted a two-run home run to 
center field. 

“This 
team, 
they’re 
very 
resilient,” Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins said. “I’ve said that 
since the fall. You know, we 
accept that we’re not perfect, and 
we’re just going to keep working 
to be excellent.”
Esman might have provided 
the weekend’s most memorable 
moment, yet she was not alone 
in contributing at the plate. 
Across 
the 
four-game 
slate, 
production came from every spot 
in the lineup. Seven different 
Wolverines registered multi-hit 
games, with senior outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad having two 
such performances. 
Michigan averaged 5.5 runs 
per game, a welcome sign after it 

mustered just three runs against 
USF and Fresno State to close out 
the USF-Rawlings Invitational a 
week ago.
“I have confidence in every 
player in our lineup when they 
come up,” Hutchins said. “We all 
know that there’s a chance to fail, 
so we don’t worry about that. We 
just go up there and try to get the 
best situation we can.”
Sophomore 
outfielder 
Lexie Blair had a bounce-back 
tournament, looking more like 
her freshman year self when she 
hit .405 as a unanimous All-Big 
Ten first team selection. Despite 
entering Friday’s game on a 
three-game hitless streak, Blair 
went 5-for-14 on the weekend, 

earning a hit in each contest. 
None was bigger than the 
infield hit Blair recorded in the 
seventh inning of Friday’s game 
against North Carolina. After 
two sacrifice bunts pushed the 
go-ahead run to third, Blair beat 
out a chopper to shortstop, giving 
Michigan the lead. 
“I was just trying to keep 
it simple,” Blair said of her 
approach. “I wasn’t trying to hit 
the ball so hard, so my swing isn’t 
how it normally is. Slow it down 
and just do my part, however I 
can.”
On 
the 
pitching 
side 
of 
things, sophomore Alex Storako 
and junior Meghan Beaubien 
continued to shoulder the load. In 

a 4-3 win against the Tar Heels, 
Storako relieved Beaubien and 
gave up only one hit across six 
innings, striking out 13. The next 
day, it was Beaubien’s turn to 
offer a dominant performance, 
going the distance with a three-
hit, nine-strikeout shutout. 
“They’re 
a 
great 
pitching 
tandem,” Hutchins said. “I’m 
pleased with that. … I think the 
fact that both of them appear to 
be quite selfless and are team 
oriented and are ready to do their 
part when they get the call is very 
impressive.”
Across 
the 
four-game 
challenge, 
the 
entire 
team 
certainly seemed ready to do its 
part.
