Couple bequeaths
largest-ever
donation from
dean to college
By CHRISTY SONG
and WILL GREENBERG
Daily Staff Reporters
In an announcement early
Thursday, School of information
dean Jeffrey MacKie-Mason and
his wife Janet Netz committed
to donating $2.5 million for an
endowed professorship - one of
the largest amounts a dean at the
University has ever donated to
his or her own school or college.
The donation will create the
Jeffrey MacKie-Mason Profes-
sor of Information, which will be
a tenured faculty position in that
school.
MacKie-Mason and Neti are
both University alumni. MacK-
ie-Mason said in an interview
Thursday that he and his wife
feel a strong sense of compassion
toward the values of the School
of Information, which serves 441
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents.
"My wife and I both believe
deeply in the value of public

universities," MacKie-Mason
said. "We just couldn't be more
excited about (the University's)
future, butit needs the support of
people who believe in it."
This contribution is the latest
in a series of high-profile dona-
tions meant to kick-start the Uni-
versity's upconing fundraising
campaign, Victors for Michigan,
which is set to launch Nov. 8.
In September, University
alum Stephen Ross, namesake
of the Ross School of Business,
donated $200 million for further
improvements to the athletic
campus and the Business School.
At her annual leadership break-
fast in early October, University
President Mary Sue Colemanan-
nounced that she and her hus-
band, political scientist Kenneth
Coleman, would be donating $1
million toward study-abroad ini-
tiatives.
MacKie-Mason said the surge
in donations comes at an impor-
tant time, as state and federal
funding for the University has
been insufficient in recent years.
In a Thursday press release,
MacKie-Mason said his contri-
bution is a great wayto repay the
opportunities providedto himby
the University.

Panelists say low-
income schools
lack science, math,
programming
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily Staff Writer
A panel of four Teach For
America alumni and one cur-
rent fellow sat before a small
audience of students Thursday
night to discuss the "crisis" in

science, technology, engineer-
ing and math education - with
the hope of luring more Univer-
sity students with science and
mathematics backgrounds into
the fellowship program.
STEM subjects are often
neglected in low-income
schools, the panelists said,
yet they're considered ciucial
toward students' success in
both college and workforce.
Improving the United States's
competitiveness in these fields
has been a priority of the
Obama administration, which

committed billions over the last
several federal budgets toward
improving STEM education.
"This year, there's a huge
need in the communities and
school districts in which we
place core members for science
and math teachers at all grade
levels," Emily Pendergraft,
regional TFA recruitment man-
ager, said.
Teach for America is a
non-profit organization that
recruits and trains recent
college graduates to teach
full-time for two years in low-

income public schools. Sixty-
seven recent graduates from
the University began teaching
,for TFA this semester.
The program has been
praised for bringing young
professionals into contact with
students and also criticized
for inadequately preparing fel-
lows for the challenges of low-
income schools, many of which
are in urban areas.
At the panel, held at the
Public Policy school, members
discussed their personal expe-

ACADEMICS
Kinesiology
adds major in
health, fitness

Inaugural class of
new concentration
has 15 students
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily News Editor
After two years of planning,
the School of Kinesiology has
rolled out a new concentration
to meet the growing demand
for educators and consultants in
physical fitness and wellness.
The Health and Fitness major
is built around a core 49 credits
that teach the fundamentals of
wellness and physical training
and then branches out to two dis-
tinct tracks: physical education
and health and fitness leadership.
The physical education track
prepares students for a teaching
certification in physical educa-
tion, while the research-based
health and fitness leadership
track prepares students for jobs
in which they will promote indi-
vidual and community health.
With rising health-care costs,
many companies are looking

for individuals with similar
backgrounds to lead wellness
programs that reduce medical
expenditures.
Both tracks prepare students
for national certification tests
for personal trainers and other
fitness professionals, and both
guarantee an internship to get
real-world experience and prac-
tice skills learned in the class-
room.
Kinesiology Dean Ron Zer-
nicke said the concentration was
developed for three reasons: to
reorient the school's priorities
to focus on health, wellness and
physical activity and to latch on
to the wide variety of work being
done throughout the University
regarding physical inactivity.
. "What we tried to do was to
figure what were the resources
we have within the school and
then how do we collaborate
across schools to give students
within our school, and others,
the best opportunities," Zernicke
said, adding that alumni have
encouraged the school to add
health and fitness elementsto the

When Josh Carn-Saferstein

decided to design and sell Mich-
igan-themed sunglasses before
University football games last

But after selling out of 500

Syrian military official
killed in al- Qaida firefight

Maj. Gen. Jameh
Jameh's cause of
death unclear
BEIRUT (AP) - One of Syria's
most powerful military officers
was killed in fighting with al-
Qaida-linked Islamic extremists
in an oil-rich eastern province
largely controlled by the rebels,
Syrian state-run television said
Thursday.
The fighting came amid a new
push to hold an elusive peace
conference for Syria's civil war,
with the government proposing
the talks start late next month,
though there was no sign the
opposition would attend.
Maj. Gen. Jameh Jameh was
killed in the provincial capital
of Deir el-Zour, where he was

state-run TV said. He was the
most senior military officer to be
killed in more than a year.
The report didnot say when
or how Jameh was killed, only
that he died "while he was carry-
ing out his mission in defending
Syria and its people."
The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
said Jameh was killed by a sniper
bullet during clashes with rebels,
including members of al-Qaida-
linked Jabhat al-Nusra or Nusra
Front.
Jameh's cousin, Haitham
Jameh, told Lebanon-based
Al-Mayadeen TV that the gen-
eral was killed when a bomb
exploded as he led his troops in
an operation in Deir el-Zour, site
of more than a year of clashes
between regime forces and rebel
fighters, who control most of the

He was the most powerful
Syrian officer to be killed since a
July 2012 bomb attack on a Cabi-
net meeting in Damascus killed
four top officials, including the
defense minister and his dep-
uty, who was President Bashar
Assad's brother-in-law. That
attack also wounded the interior
minister.
Jameh played a major role
in Lebanon when Damascus
dominated its smaller neighbor.
When Syrian troops withdrew
from Lebanon in 2005, ending
nearly a three-decade military
presence, Jameh was in charge
of Syrian intelligence in the capi-
tal, Beirut.
He was amongseveraltop Syr-
ian officers suspectedofhavinga
role in the 2005 assassination of
former Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri. Syria denies any
involvement in the slaying.

Lawmakers Wednesday voted to avoid a financial default and reopen the government after a 16-day partial shutdown.
Stock market reaches an all
ime high after debt deal vote

With the debt crisis
averted market on
the incline again
NEW YORK (AP) - The
stock market hit an all-time high
Thursday as investors put the
government shutdown and debt
ceiling crisis behind them and
focused on corporate earnings.
The Standard & Poor's 500
index rose 11.61 points, or 0.7
percent, to close at 1,733.15 - a
record close.
The market rose throughout
the day as investors got back to
focusing on corporate earnings
and economic data. American
Express and Verizon rose the
most in the Dow Jones industrial
average after reporting earn-
ings that beat expectations from
financial analysts.
The Dow ended the day down
two points, or 0.01 percent, to
15,371.65. The index of 30 big
U.S. companies was held back by
declines in IBM, Goldman Sachs
and UnitedHealth.
IBM's third-quarter revenue
fell and missed Wall Street's
forecast by more than $1 billion.

The stock closed down $11.90, or
6 percent, to $174.80. Earlier, it
had touched its lowest level of the
past year - $172.57
Goldman Sachs also weighed
down the index. The investment
bank's revenue fell sharply as
trading in bonds and other secu-
rities slowed. Goldman fell $3.93,
or 2.4 percent, to $158.32.
The focus on earnings is a
change of pace for Wall Street,
which had been absorbed in
Washington's political drama
over the last month.
Now that the U.S. has avoided
the possibility of default, at least
for a few months, earnings news
is expected to dominate trading
for the next couple weeks. So far,
only 79 companies in the S&P
500 have reported third-quarter
results, according to S&P Capital
IQ. Analysts expect earnings at
those companies to increase 3.3
percent over the same period a
year ago.
"I don't think we can com-
pletely close the door on the debt
ceiling chapter just yet, but we
can get backto the stuff that real-
ly matters," said Jonathan Cor-
pina, who manages trading on
the floor of the New York Stock

Exchange for Meridian Equity
Partners.
Other indexes also posted big
gains. The Nasdaq composite
closed up 23,71 points, or 0.6 per-
cent, to 3,863.15.
The Russell 2000 index,
which is made up of primarily
smaller, riskier companies, also
hit an all-time high. It closed
up 9.85 points, or 0.9 percent, to
1,102.27 and has risen nearly 30
percent this year.
Market analysts think the
16-day partial shutdown of the
government caused billions of
dollars of damage to the econ-
omy. Government employees
were furloughed, contracts were
delayed, and tourism declined at
national parks.
Analysts at Wells Fargo said
the shutdown likely lowered eco-
nomic growth by 0.5 percentage
point.
There remain broader con-
cerns that Democrats and
Republicans won't be able to
draw up a longer-term budget.
The deal approved late Wednes-
day only permits the Treasury
Department to borrow through
Feb. 7 and fund the government
through Jan. 15.

DETROIT
Woman found
dead from gunshot
Authorities have released the
identity of a woman whose body
was found on a front lawn near
her west side Detroit home.
The Wayne County medi-
cal examiner's office tells The
Detroit News that 19-year-old
Kimberly Muse died of a gunshot
wound to her chest.
The Wayne County prosecu-

that the victim was a 16-year-old
girl. Muse's mother confirmed
her identity late Wednesday.
Muse's body was found Sun-

Devin Brown of Detroit was
arraigned Wednesday on a man-

ORLANDO, Fla.
Two murderers
mistakenly let go
from Florida jail
At first glance, the paperwork
ordering the release of two con-
victed murderers serving life sen-
tences in a Florida prison looked
legitimate.
So the guards at Franklin Cor-
rectional Institution in the Florida
Panhandle put one of the men on
a bus and opened the gates for
the other to ride away with fam-
ily. Authorities now say prison
officials were duped by the court
documents, which included a fake
motion from a prosecutor and a
judge's forged signature.
As prison officials, prosecu-
tors and courts across the state
scrambled to make sure no one
else had been mistakenly released,
police were searching for the two
men who already had a head start.
Joseph Jenkins was let out Sept.
27, and Charles Walker was freed

Foreign markets
tepid after U.S. gov.
debt deal finalized
A day after the U.S. Congress
stepped back from the abyss
and avoided a potentially disas-
trous default, investor relief was
checked Thursday by concerns
over the cost of Washington's
drawn-out political battle.
Even though Congress has
agreed to raise the $16.7 trillion
debt ceiling and end a 16-day
partial government shutdown,
the relief rally that started on
Wall Street on Wednesday has
largely petered out. The dol-
lar was down sharply and stock
markets drifted.
Investors around the world,
including fund managers hold-
ing dollars and Treasurys, have
been unimpressed by the politi-
cal squabbling that has threat-
ened the U.S. since 2011. The
question is whether the brink-
manship will become the new

One of his preliminary find-

had no effect in other mice. He
found that mice with another

Sarkaria urged University
students to pursue science, say-
ing that what he loves about

House GOP look past
shutdown to election

Vote on bill to
repoen federal
gov't will be key
during next cycle
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
group.of House Republicans
planning Senate campaigns next
year took-different betsion a bill
in Congress ending a govern-
ment shutdown and avoiding
a default. For some, a general
election loomed large while for
others, the vote was a matter of
competing for conservative pri-
mary voters.
The high-profile vote
Wednesday night to end the
16-day partial government shut-
down and stave off a national
default divided Republicans in
the House and Senate and could
turn into a noteworthy issue in
next year's midterm elections.
In the Senate, Republicans
need to pick up six seats to
recapture the majority during
President Barack Obama's final
two years. Republican outside
groups paid close attention to
the vote, with organizations like
the Club for Growth and Heri-
tage Action urging lawmakers
to vote against the measure,
while business groups like the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce said
it was necessary to avoid an eco-
nomic calamity.
For House Republicans with
Senate ambitions, the vote
offered a window into their
political standing. By voting
for the bill, Republicans were
insulated to a certain degree
against Democrats' accusations
that they would have allowed
the government to default. By
opposing it, they sided with con-
servatives who despise Obama's
health care- law and spending
record.
Four lawmakers who may
seek the GOP presidential nomi-
nation in 2016 - Sens. Rand
Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio
of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas
and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wiscon-
sin - voted against the bill.

In the House, Reps. Tom
Cotton of Arkansas, Shelley
Moore Capito of West Virginia
and Steve Daines of Montana
supported the bill. All three
are well-positioned to win the
Republican nomination for Sen-
ate seats currently controlled by
Democrats.
Cotton is challenging vulner-
able Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark.,
the son of the state's former
senator and governor. Cotton
said supporting the bill gave
Congress time to "stop Wash-
ington's out-of-control spend-
ing," but his vote put him at odds
with the Club for Growth. The
group has supported Cotton
and been airing ads in Arkansas
criticizing Pryor's connection to
Obama's health care law.
Barney Keller, a club spokes-
man, said the group strongly
supported Cotton, but "we sim-
ply disagree with him on this
vote."
Capito said the government
needed to be reopened, and it
was "clearly not in our country's
best interests to default on our
debts." Daines cited frustration
that the measure was temporary
and Congress could face another
debt crisis in months.
The vote could affect at least
two Republican incumbents in
the Senate.
Senate Republican leader
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., helped
negotiate the deal with Demo-
cratic leaders and his role quick-
ly drew opposition from tea
party-backed primary challeng-
er Matt Bevin, who said McCon-
nell had sold out conservatives.
Democrats are waiting in the
wings with Alison Lundergan
Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of
state, hoping a difficult primary
could weaken the powerful GOP
leader in the general election.
In Mississippi, the Club for
Growth and the Senate Con-
servatives Fund, which have
played formidable roles in
Republican primaries, endorsed
Chris McDaniel, a state senator
who announced his campaign
Thursday to unseat GOP Sen.

Ignoring research, wasting time
Studies show same-sex marriages aren't harmful to children
n Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman said a rul-
ing on Michigan's ban on gay marriage would not be decided
until February - a loss for those in the state anxiously awaiting
equal rights. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette previously filed a
brief to the court that stated, "The understanding of marriage as a union
of man and woman ... is age-old, universal, and enduring. As illustrated by
a plethora of research, social scientists have consistently recognized the
essential connection between marriage and responsible procreation and
childrearing." Lawyers for the state - charged with spending taxpayers
money to defend the ban - have claimed that same-sex relationships are
harmful to society. This offensive and marginalizing view contradicts the
numerous social-science studies that disprove any notion that same-sex
marriages are harmful to children and families.

From campaign slogans to
Twitter handles. From tele-
vision ads to governing phi-
losophy.
Michigan Gov.
Rick Snyder has
carefully culti-
vated an image
as "One Tough
Nerd" - the
rational politi-
cian above parti-
sanship who uses ALEXANDER
data, facts and HERMANN
colorful charts
to push his state-
wide agenda.
But who knew nerds could be so
secretive?
Snyder's NERD Fund is being
broadly criticized again this week
following his testimony under oath
claiming that he did not know who
donated to the fund. The deposi-
tion was part of the City of Detroit's
ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.
The New Energy to Reinvent and
Diversify Fund, a nonprofit estab-
lished shortly after the governor
took office, has been controversial
since its inception. Critics claim the
organization could function as a sin-
ister mechanism to accept untold
"campaign donations" under a cloud
of secrecy.
Funds like NERD are common
across the state and nation. Its stat-
ed goal, to defer some cost of gov-
ernance to willing private-sector
participants, is broadly appealing
in an era of increasing budget con-
straints and cost-cutting measures.
Currently, for example, NERD
pays Detroit Emergency Manager
Kevyn Orr's $4,200 monthly con-
dominium bill as well as some travel
expenses - money otherwise owed
to him by the city under Public Act
436, Michigan's new emergency
manager law.
So what's so controversial about

NERD then, really?
For starters, unlike most non-
profits controlled by public offi-
cials, NERD funders can donate
anonymously - a clear violation of
governmental integrity, transpar-
ency and accountability. Special
interests, major corporations and
wealthy private donors are free to
give unlimited sums to a nonprofit
controlled by the top-elected offi-
cial in the state of Michigan with-
out any public disclosure.
Generating the greatest skep-
ticism, for example, is Richard
Baird's six-figure salary paid for
by NERD. Baird is one of Snyder's
top aides, with the almost playfully
antagonistic job title "Transfor-
mation Manager," but where the
money really comes from is not pub-
lic knowledge. And the governor's
office isn't telling.
Compounding matters, trans-
parency and accountability have
already been a primary critique
of Snyder in his first term. In fact,
Mark Schauer, gubernatorial can-
didate and frontrunner for the
Democratic nomination in 2014, has
already lambasted the "secretive
NERD Fund" as a medium through
which "special interests" can oper-
ate outside the public gaze.
Frustratingly, the solution to Sny-
der's public-relations problem is as
rational, fact-driven, and nerd-like
as it is manifest.
Like similar nonprofits, embed-
ded in NERD's mission should be a
voluntary commitment to sunshine
on par with public-sector regula-
tions. Instead of vague IRS filings,
like the $522,866 2011 expenditure
for "the promotion of civic action
and social welfare by promoting the
common good and general welfare
of the residents of, and visitors to,
the state of Michigan," let's spell out
detailed contributions and impact.
Instead of anonymous donations,

let's foster an environment promot-
ing public inclusion.
If Snyder is reluctant to reveal
funders that have already made
donations under the assumption
of anonymity, then fine. But, as a
gesture of good faith, he should
revamp NERD immediately, which
would simultaneously foster an
environment of transparency and
cut off allegations of cronyism,
wrongdoing and secrecy heading
into an election year.
At the same time, unabashed
criticisms of the efficacy of NERD,
despite the obvious shortcomings in
implementation, are unfounded.
When used correctly, nonprofits
like NERD can be an effective, cost-
saving and cutting-edge tool of gov-
ernance as part of a broader trend in
local and state government toward
public-private partnerships. Such
partnerships seemingly defray tax-
payer costs and unburden unwieldy
government bureaucracies. Locally,
for example, the Detroit Economic
Growth Corporation is a private
nonprofit organization whose
board is appointed by the mayor of
Detroit and confirmed by Detroit
City Council. DEGC executes con-
tracts for the city and shares staff
with public development agencies
such as the Downtown Develop-
ment Authority.
But the benefits of public-private
partnerships, with NERD serving
as an example, are only meaningful
given that proper mechanisms of
compliance, transparency and pub-
lit accountability remain intact.
Given the clear outcomes of bet-
ter governance, healthier political
discourse and improved reelection
chances, "One Tough Nerd" should
be more concerned with being "One
Transparent Governor."

Originally, this case was brought to the
courts challenging the ban in Michigan
against same-sex couples adopting chil-
dren, but the women who brought the case
expanded it to challenge the ban on same-sex
marriages in the state brought on by a voter-
approved amendment to the state constitu-
tion. A decision was expected on Wednesday,
and many people were hopeful that the ban
on gay marriage would be overturned. How-
ever, a decision was not made, and it was del-
egated instead to a trial that will be held in
February of next year, leaving gay couples
who want to get married in limbo.
According to state attorney Kristin Heyse,
the concept of the "optimal home environ-
ment" is one that involves a marriage between
a man and woman. Beside insulting the numer-
ous families headed by parents of the same sex,
there is substantial evidence that doesn't sup-
port this claim. There is evidence that proves
there is no difference in the well-being of chil-
dren when it comes to whether they are raised
by same sex couples or by a heterosexual couple.
The American Sociological Association says
that "greater stability in a relationship, whether
same-sex or opposite-sex, does improve child
well-being."

If marriage helps to improve the rela-
tionships of same-sex couples, children of
same-sex couples could benefit from the
legalization of same-sex marriage in Michi-
gan. According to an article in Lawyers Jour-
nal in response to the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling the Defense of Marriage Act uncon-
stitutional, "the invalidation of DOMA will
have a primary beneficial effect on the chil-
dren born to or adopted by a same-sex cou-
ple." Allowing same-sex marriage also allows
for children of same-sex couples to be treated
the same as children born to or adopted by
heterosexual couples. If Friedman is wait-
ing for social science to show that gay family
dynamics can be negative for children, he is
waiting for proof that isn't going to surface.
Findings on gay family dynamics clearly indi-
cate that gay family dynamics are just as good
for children as heterosexual couple families. -
The judge has decided to wait until Febru-
ary to make a decision that could change many
people's lives for the better and make the state
more appealing to the LGBTQ community.
Waiting for more evidence in regard to social
science is simply not a reasonto have to wait for
a decision that could, and should, grant same-
sex couples the right to marriage in Michigan.

Rape culture is real

Asexual ouble standar dbd

Over the summer The New York Times
printed a lead story relevant to many stu-
dents, "Sex on Campus: She Can Play That
Game, Too"." This article makes the same
argument that almost every newspaper arti-
cle and psychologist has made in the past
three years when tackling this subject. The
article states that women as well as men are
engaging in the increasingly popular type of
relationships known as hookup buddies. And
in an even more typical 21st-century thought,
the women in the article say they don't want
relationships because they are too busy with
school and extracurricular activities to put in
the time. Hookup buddies give women a sex-
ual outlet without the effort of a relationship.
I, however, see a different view of hook-
ing up. Articles and psychologists continue
to insist that these relationships benefit men
more than women. The article cites the sta-
tistic that men were more likely to receive
oral sex than give it to their female hookup
partner. Psychologists agreed, stating that
hookups were more about benefiting the male
partner than the female. This, however, could
be due to the fact that blow jobs for men are
much more socially acceptable, and it's pos-
sibly less stressful for a girl to give oral sex
than to receive it.
I see hookup buddies as allowing women to
have casual sex with the same person, instead
of a continual string of one-night stands. Men
may be seen as enjoying one-night stands
more than women because there's no emo-
tional attachment. While this article states
truthfully that women want a singular physi-
cal relationship as much as men, it's harder
for women to only want that and ignore the
societal influences that say they can't have a
solely physical relationship.
The double standard of how many people

one sleeps with means a women cannot have a
string of casual one-night stands without being
labeled a slut and thus not "girlfriend material."
Hookup buddies allow a women to have casual
sex withoutincreasing her number every night.
One of the Pennsylvania State University
students interviewed for the magazine said
of her hookup buddy, "We don't really like
each other in person, sober." While this may
be true of some relationships, I would guess
there are other factors at play, like "We like
each other but not enough to actually work
at a relationship." It's possible that hookup
buddy has deal-breaking features that make
a relationship not worthwhile or even out of
the question. Maybe he is too much of a pot-
head or drinks too much and studies too little.
Maybe it's all in the timing. It's not worth get-
ting heartbroken because a guy is leaving for
study-abroad next semester or lives in a dif-
ferent state during the summer and wants to
be single duringthose periods.
I also think this switch from relationships
to hookups demonstrates the significance
this generation puts on relationships. I know
people who will hook up for months, clas-
sify their relationship as exclusive and still
not call each other boyfriend and girlfriend.
Many students have grown up with divorced
parents. Out of my group of friends in high
school, only myself and one other have par-
ents still together after their first marriage.
Being in a relationship means more than
just being exclusive. It's a combination of
assets and feelings that is harder to break off
when things go wrong. Students just aren't
willing to make that commitment until they
know the output is worth the input. And let's
face it, every time but once, it won't be.
Jesse Klein is an LSA junior.

t's almost impossible not to
think of Steubenville, Ohio
when hearing about the
recent case in
Maryville, Mis-
souri. For those
who haven't
yet heard of the
Maryville case
- or the Steu-
benville case,
for that matter KATIE
- both involve ST N
the alleged rape
of an intoxicated
teenaged girl by
hot-shot football players, and both
involve the community rising to the
defense of the alleged rapists.
The Maryville story is a long,
horrifying ordeal that's been, for
the most part, buried from the eyes
of the public until recently. To sum-
marize: In January 2012, 14-year-
old cheerleader Daisy Coleman
sneaked out with a friend to meet
up with 17-year-old football player
Matthew Barnett. She was encour-
aged to drink excessively out of
the "bitch cup," and was allegedly
raped by Barnett while his buddy
filmed it with an iPhone. Her friend,
Paige Parkhurst, just 13 at the time
- under the age of consent in Mis-
souri, by the way - was also alleg-
edly sexually assaulted by another
football player. After all of this,
Coleman was left on a front lawn
in below freezing weather for her
mother to find in the morning. This
was more than a year ago, and most
people are just hearing about it now.
I encourage you to read more on it if
you're interested in educating your-
self further and ruining your day.
But today, those football bud-
dies are off at college, free from all
charges of sexual assault - or any-
thing, for that matter. Even with all
of the evidence against the alleged
rapists - even after Sheriff Darren
White reportedly stated that this
would "absolutely" result in a con-
viction - the boys still were able to
walk free. Sheriff White's advice to
the Colemans? "I guess they're just
going to have to get over it."
Rape cases are already hugely
underreported, so when something
as heinous as the Maryville case gets
utterly brushed to the side, what kind
of message does that send?
It sends a message that says
Maryville supports its football
players, supports masculinity and
"boys will be boys" - but ladies
who get mixed up with these boys
are "skanks" and "crazy bitch-
es." In short, Maryville supports
rape culture.
So who were the victims of the
Maryville incident? Well, there
were of course the boys, whose rep-
utations and football careers were at

stake. A parent of one of the teens at
Barnett's house is actually reported
as saying, "Our boys deserve an
apology, and they haven't gotten it
yet." There were the poor cowork-
ers at Mrs. Coleman's old work-
place, who had to deal with her
"stress." There was even Barnett's
daddy, a GOP politician in Missouri
who decided to stay out of the case
because it "would have been bad for
me." As far as the girls who were
allegedly raped? "F--- yea. That's
what you get for bein a skank : ),"
reads ose tweet in response to the
dismissed charges.
Victim-blaming is nothing new;
we've heard it all before. She drank
too much; she was asking for it;
she should have known better; she
shouldn't have worn that outfit;
she shouldn't have been hanging
around boys that age; she was out
too late at night; why didn't she take
a cab? Why did she take a cab? She
should have called the police sooner
- it goes on and on and on.
There's the flip side of victim-
blaming, and that's rape apology, but
I'm thinking even more specifically
of a bizarre form of rape sympathy
that I've been noticing. The focus, in
the case of rape sympathy, is taken
off the victim, and placed on the
repercussions that the rapist will or
would have to potentially face.
I'm thinking of those photographs
in The New York Times - of those
poor Steubenville boys who could
have had it all, dressed in neat but-
ton-downs, rendered weeping into
their palms in the courtroom because
of some stupidgirl who ruined every-
thing for them. I'm thinking of CNN
anchor Candy Crowley's response to
the Steubenville rapists' sentencing
- "I cannot imagine how emotional
the sentencing must have been." I'm
thinking of endless hateful tweets
aimed at "sluts" and "skanks" of all
ages all over the world. I'm thinking
of the incident in Torrington, Con-
necticut - another rape case involv-
ing football players.
This case involved two 18-year-old
football players, Edgar Gonzalez and
Joan Toribio, who were convicted
of rape after they had sex with two
13-year-old girls, with the age of con-
sent in Connecticut being 16. What
happened next was a slew of online
harassment targeted toward, of
course, these girls - these girls who
were still in middle school. "What
was a 13 year old girl doing hang-
ing around with 18 year old guys..."
one girl posted on Twitter. I'd ask
the question in response, what were
18-year-old boys doing have sex with
girls who weren't even out of middle
school? "You destroyed two people's
lives" another tweet reads, refer-
ring, of course, to the boys' lives. This
is past the point of rape apology -

it's sympathy.
One of the football players, Gon-
zalez, won the title of MVP for
his team, and in response to the
charges, Torrington High School's
Athletic Director Mike McKenna
stated, "If you think there's some
wild band of athletes that are wan-
dering around then I think you're
mistaken ... These things happen
everywhere and we're not any dif-
ferent than any other community."
And he's right.
I think it's worth stopping and
considering how this all-American,
sports-centric model that exists in
so many high schools - and colleges
- affects how people view masculin-
ity and sexual assault. I'm not say-
ing football is to blame for rape, just
like too many shots at a party, a short
skirt, not having a boyfriend, letting
him pay for you at the bar ... is not to
blame for rape. Rapists are to blame
for rape. It's been said so many times
and yet it still hasn't quite seem to
have gotten through to everyone.
So what happens when the Uni-
versity has its very own sexual
assault scandal involving a football
player? We sweep it under the rug,
pretend it never happened, and head
to the game to lose our voices cheer-
ing on our beloved Wolverines. In
2009, current University senior
and placekicker on the University
football team Brendan Gibbons was
arrested for allegedly raping an
18-year-old woman at a fraternity
party. Washtenaw Watchdogs has a
detailed synopsis of the allegations,
and Daily blogger Emma Maniere
wrote about Gibbons fairly recent-
ly, but for the most part, it's been
willfully ignored by the University.
Many University students and Wol-
verine fans still don't know about
the allegations, and even after they
do find out about them - well, the
thought of there being a potential
rapist on the field while we sing the
fight song is kind of uncomfortable,
so we dismiss those thoughts.
In the Gibbons police reports, it's
written, "(Gibbons) stated his whole
life will probablyget ruined, and that
the girl always wins." Let's make
one thing clear: The girl does not
always win. According to RAINN, as
many as 97 percent of rapists are not
charged. The girl very rarely "wins."
And anyway,. sex should not have
a "winner." A woman you want to
take to bed is not your opponent. Sex
is not just another sport - another
way to reaffirm your masculinity-
and machismo.
Rape culture is real, and it's
important to be mindful of how
we're participating, even if it's just
as spectators.

FILM REVIEW
'Machete' suffers slow
death by a dull edge

Cooking up an epic facial expression.
Cook talks1'Idol
fame, Ark concert

Famed reality show
singer to perform
new material
By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Arts Writer
In 2008, David Cook won
the seventh season of "Ameri-
can Idol," and this weekend, as
Cook tours the
United States
with Gavin David Cook
DeGraw, he'll Sunday at
visit Ann Arbor 7:30 p.m.
to deliver one of
his high-caliber The Ark
and emotion-
ally provoking $30
performances
at The Ark.
As a singer, songwriter and
musician, Cook is an artist who
never fails to put his heart on the
line for his music, and he's been
that way from a young age.
"Music kind of, for me,. has
been a bit therapeutic," Cook
said. "I turned to songwriting
to try to take whatever nega-

tive energy and angst you have
as a teenager and present it in a
socially acceptable way. Fortu-
nately, I've been able to ... make a
career out of it."
Though he didn't originally
plan to participate in "American
Idol," Cook has high regard for
the show and appreciates where
it has gotten him today.
"I think I was at an amazing
platform," Cook said. "The com-
mon misconception is that it's a
golden ticket and everybody who
wins the show is going to be huge.
But it gives you a moment, and
you have to seize that moment.
"I think there are people that
probably try out for the show to
be famous and there are people
who try out because they love
music and want to make a career
out of it. As long as the intentions
are pure, 'Idol' can do whatever
you want it to do for you."
Following his triumph on
"American Idol," Cook's debut
single, "Light On," went plati-
num and hit Billboard Hot 100's
Top 20 songs in 2009. Cook
released his second album, This
Loud Morning, after completing

his first major yearlong tour. This
Loud Morning featured tracks
written and co-written by Cook
along with many acclaimed song-
writers, including David Hodges,
Ryan Tedder, Kevin Griffin and
Marti Frederiksen.
For all young aspiring artists,
Cook gives the same piece of
advice that was given to him as
he found his place in the music
industry.
"If you really want to get into
the music industry, you need get
used to the word 'no,"' Cook said.
"I think for every one time I've
heard 'yes,' I've probably heard
'no' about a hundred times more.
If you can get through the 'no' s,
you can usually find a career for
yourself."
This weekend, along with per-
forming some old material, Cook
will play several new songs.
"I see people familiar with the
two RCA records, so there will
be a lot for them to hear. We're
also working on a new record,"
Cook said. "This whole tour came
about as a way to get new songs
out, really let us test some new
material."

TV REVIEW
Ballads slow the Avett Brothers'
'Magpie and the Dandelion'

By KARSTEN SMOLINSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Director Robert Rodriguez's
("Machete") latest tribute to
exploitation cinema isn't just
bloody - it's a
bloody mess.
The near
incoherent Mace
story, un-
spirednaction ills
sequences and Rave and
stale dialogue Quaity6
place this film
firmly in "to be Open oad -
avoided" terri-
tory.
In this sequel to 2010's
"Machete," Danny Trejo ("Spy
Kids") reprises his role as the
titular character - an unstop-
pable, emotionless (or is that
just Trejo?) badass whose pre-
ferred method of murdering
his enemies is with a machete.
He's basically the Hispanic ver-
sion of Steven Seagal. Machete's
mission begins in earnest when
the president of the United
States, played by Charlie Sheen
("Scary MoVie") - who's billed
in the movie under his birth
name, Carlos Estevez - charg-
es Machete with preventing
the nuclear destruction of the
world. Machete then predict-
ably proceeds to cut his way
through countless cartel mem-
bers and nameless henchmen
in a haze of gimmicky and gory
violence.
One of the film's primary
antagonists is El Camale6n, a
face-changing assassin hunting
Machete. El Camale6n is played
in turn by a slew of different
actors such as Walton Goggins
("Django Unchained"), Cuba
Gooding Jr. ("Lee Daniels' The
Butler"), Lady Gaga and Anto-
nio Banderas ("Puss in Boots").
This may seem like a conve-
nient excuse to present a string
of celebrity cameos, but he/she
represents the most innovative
character in a long line of stock
villains.
Unfortunately, Sofia Ver-
gara's ("Modern Family") char-
acter, a Mexican dominatrix
and bordello operator, is one of
the villains that completely fail
to entertain. Her "Double-D's,"
an iron bra with machine-guns,
could have been ripped straight
from "Austen Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me."

The Avett Brothers announce

tionsin the opening track of their
eighth studio

combination of modern rock ele-

to from start to finish, though
marred by poor track sequenc-

Magpie and the Dandelion was
entirely produced by musical
savant Rick Rubin, who over-

often regarded
as one of his A2CT Studio Theater
best works, $12
which, consid-
ering his track
record and the
fact that he's one of - if not the
- greatest writer of all time, is a
pretty big deal.
Intimidating as such a drama
may seem, the Ann Arbor Civic
Theatre is ready to perform it in
all its moral complexities, with
a cast of 11 actors playing all the
characters in the ensemble-driv-
en production.
For those of you who haven't
.read "King Lear" since AP Lit-
erature, here's a refresher:
Lear, the elderly king of
England, decides to divide his
kingdom between his three
daughters, Goneril, Regan and
Cordelia. Before doing so, he
decides to test each of his daugh-
ters, asking each to describe how
much they love him. The cunning
and ambitious Goneril and Regan
use excessive flattery and fawning
to please their father. However,
youngest daughter Cordelia replies
simply that she has no words to
describe how much she loves her
father. This enrages Lear, and he,
subsequently banishesherfronthe
kingdom. Having attained power,
Goneril and Regan show their true
colors and betray Lear, who slowly
falls into madness.
"Lear" 's director, Kat Walsh,
has had a passion for theater and

dance since a young age and stud-
ied theater in college. This produc-
tion marks the fourth show she has
directed for Ann Arbor Civic The-
atre.
For Walsh, what differentiates
"King Lear" from other Shake-
spearean tragedies is the title char-
acter himself.
"Unlike his other tragedies,"
Walsh said, "the protagonist does
not have a tragic flaw. Hamlet
is plagued by inaction, Macbeth
with ambition and Othello with
jealousy, and while Lear certainly
has his flaws, pride being one, you
come away feeling that he is truly
'a man more sinned against than
sinning."-
There's no pinpointing Lear's
source of failure, but is failure even
an apt description? The entirety of
"Lear" involves truth and percep-
tion, and whether they matter at all
to the natural world.
"The play," Walsh said, "con-

fronts the existential question of
'nothingness' and what it means to
be a human in a sometimes cruel
and indifferent world."
Indeed, ambiguity is one of the
most striking aspects of "King
Lear," and perhaps the most dis-
turbing. Even though retribution is
served when evil characters die, so,
too, do unfailingly virtuous char-
acters. There is a supreme uncer-
tainty at who triumphs in the end.
Nature does not dispense justice
in accordance with any social or
moral code.
It is in this collective fear
of humanity that the audience
becpmes engulfed in the story.
Lear ponders the almighty power
of nature as sompared to the
frailty of man, the audience
ponders along with him. Lear's
insignificance is one's own insig-
nificance. And that, according
to Walsh, is what theater's all
about.

and envi-

how nature influences stu-

of childhood and home. This
fascinating project is the final
product of a Residential Col-
lege English class taught by
Prof. Liz Goodenough. Good-
enough, in collaboration with
cultural geographer Anja Hilg
Bieri, worked with students
to develop these novel sound-
scapes.
"It was a course that used
authors that wrote for chil-
dren of the Great Lakes who
celebrated the Mitten and the
lakes around it," Goodenough
said. "Their books explore
how their location shaped
their behavior, their character
and their play histories. So we
asked, did it matter that they
had a white pine in their front
yard? Did it matter that they
lived by a river? Did it matter
that they lived in the middle of
Chicago? These are the types
of questions that helped the
students formulate their life
stories."
These personal narratives
were developed throughout
the semester, both inside the
classroom and ontrips to near-

"Throughout the semes-
ter they were always writing
on their impressions, their
readings and their autobiog-

writing was one creation and
the other creation was the
soundscape and the sound
work. It's really an interdisci-
plinary approach that fosters
the creative process of the
students' work. They had to
understand the software and
then be able to compose and
revise both their writing and
their sound and then give each
other feedback."
At the end of the semes-
ter, in a reader's theater, the
students stood up in front of
the class and presented their
soundscapes. It was months
later, with the help of Chil-
dren's Literature Learning
Librarian Jo Angela Oehrli,
that these final.products were
chosen for display to a much
wider audience in Room 100 of
the Graduate Library.
"We talked to (Oehrli), and
she approached me and want-
ed to do this," Goodenough
said. "It is a museum quality
exhibit with innovative sound
domes, which I had never seen
before. You stand under it and
you don't hear what's outside
and when you're not under it
you don't hear what's inside
the dome. You get this kind of
three dimensional experience
which is amazing."
The soundscapes are meant
for both the campus popula-
tions and the entire city of Ann
Arbor since they are available
for download from the Inter-
net.
"You can download them
and go to the Arboretum where
the walks were inspired," Bieri
said. "We have a path, not a
path exactly from A to Z, but
more a certain area which
you can see on the map in the
exhibit. We hope that people
who go to the exhibit will
want to go outside too. We
noticed when we listened to
the soundscapes in class that
they had a certain quality,
but when you go outside and
hear them as you walk it adds
a whole different dimension."
In the future, these sound-

scapes may even be used to
encourage families staying at
the Ronald McDonald House
to go outside.
"I met with Robert Grese,
the Director of Nichols Arbo-
retum, and Julie Piazza who
is the child life internship and
training coordinator at Mott
Children's Hospital," Good-
enough said. "They want to
use the exhibit, so in January,
it's going to migrate in some
kind of enhanced form. One of
the missions of Nichols Arbo-
retum is to get the families
staying at the Ronald McDon-
ald House, who have traveled
many miles and are under a
lot of stress, to actually go to
the Arb."

soundscapes
and walk
the Arb.
The soundscapes them-
selves encourage every listen-
er to utilize their senses and
appreciate the nature around
them.
"Every soundscape has
its own message," Bieri said.
"They're less straightforward
documentary so you can really
take away what you'd like, but
the meta-message is one that
is based in the philosophy of
aesthetic education. The one
who makes the soundwalk,
but also the one who takes it
uses a mixture of their senses
and their intellect and their
imagination to understand.
"We really hope to trigger
new questions of how to look
at the world, how to look at
nature and culture. Nature
is in part formed by our cul-
ture. Our understanding of
nature and what it looks like,
our autobiography of it. The
nature we carry in our heads."

Considering
the Wolverines' performances
over the past few games -- and
Indiana's surprising upset over
Penn State two weeks ago - the
dismissive mentalityhasvanished
into thin air just about as quickly
as redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner has had to elude
pass rushers. So far, Gardner has
prided himself on strong second-
half performances and trying to
stay cool under pressure.
"I feel like I did a really good
job in the locker room with poise
and leading my team," Gardner
said.
Added offensive coordinator
Al Borges: "(Gardner) got blind-
sided. He recovered and showed
composure throughout the foot-.
ball game. At no time was I in any
doubt that he could not bring us
back, and he proved me right."
Michigan would prefer Gard-
ner to not have to pull off a come-

February.
With the addition of junior
forward Alex Guptill - who
finished with two assists in his
season debut against RIT after
sitting out the season opener
due to a violation of team rules -
Michigan has a chance of getting
its first series sweep nearly four
months earlier than it did last
season.
Despite having missed over
a week of preseason practice,
Guptill showed no signs of slug-
gishness on the fourth line in his
first game of the year - the first
of Guptill's two assists came on
his first shift. He will join senior
forward Derek DeBlois and soph-
omore forward Andrew Copp on
the top line this weekend.
Against RIT, Guptill saw time
with DeBlois and Copp thanks to
a number of special-teams situ-
ations. The trio - which skated
together for the latter half of last
season - fellin sync immediately.
On their first shift back together,

ing them on the East Coast.

that previous series against the
Wildcats, gets to experience it.
"It was a crazy atmosphere,"
he said. "It'll be a great place

of its crippled interior offensive
line. Michigan went without its
only offensive captain, fifth-year
senior left tackle Taylor Lewan,
after he went down early in the
second half against the Nittany
Lions.
The coaches had to take
Lewan's helmet away to stop
him from going back on the field.
Monday, though, Hoke said that
Lewan's injury - a "hip deal," not
a concussion - is not major, and
he will indeed play Saturday.
But for as much as the focus
is on which offense will show up
against Indiana, the Wolverines
are equally concerned about how
their defense will hold up.
The Hoosiers rank in the top
three in the Big Ten in numer-
ous categories that include total

offense. But they are perhaps
best known for their high-tempo
offense. Hoke compared it to the
Northwestern, Nebraska and
Ohio State squads that the Wol-
verines faced last season (Michi-
gan went 1-2 in those games).
More recently, the Wolverines
had difficulty with the Nittany
Lions's fast pace last weekend.
They did get caught out of posi-
tion, but as Hoke was quick to
point out, it was only once.
Defensive coordinator Greg'
Mattison didn't specifically
divulge how Michigan planned
on preparing for the tempo, other
than saying that Hoke has man-
agedthe scout offense.
"It's guys getting back to the
huddle, it's guys getting the sig-
nal on the fly, all those things,"

Mattison said. "The good thing is
we've been working on the rota-
tion all along. Ifa guy has to play
five plays rather than three plays,
fine, we'll get them in and outthat
way."
The Hoosiers lead the league
with their pass offense with an
average of 331.5 passing yards
per game, giving Michigan's pass
rush its biggest test of the season
thus far. It registered four sacks
against the Nittany Lions last
week, but Hoke isn't sure if it will
be able to keep up with the fast
pace of the game.
"I'm not going to say it's harder
because I think you can do it,"
Hoke said. "I've experienced it
being done. It can get you rattled
a little bit, and sometimes that
makes it harder."

For Devin Funchess, a move out
wide and into football's future

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
When Devin Funchess wasn't
busy leading his high-school team
to a Michigan Division II state
title, he was driving his coaches
crazy. On the field, Funchess was
budding into the versatile, multi-
purpose weapon that the Michi-
gan football team began to see
midway through the 2013 season.
But when he got to the sideline, his
mind would seem elsewhere.
After a series, John Herrington
- the coach of Harrison High
School in Farmington Hills, Mich.
- says that he'd mug for the cheer-
leaders. When the play called for
Funchess to block, Herrington
never knew what he would get.
"When he wanted to, when he
wanted to block, he could come
down and could really block," Her-
rington said. "When he wanted to.
He envisioned himself as more of
a split end, to be honest with you."
It took years, but Funchess
finally has his chance at Michigan.
The depth chart says he's the start-
ing tight end, but Michigan coach
Brady Hoke allows that he's "not
yet a traditional tight end." More
often than not, against Minnesota
and Penn State, Funchess was split
out wide as a receiver. Funchess
himself has pretty much stayed
loyal to the company line. He has
been pressed, but he has refused to
say he prefers one position to the
other.
"Personally, I just wanna help
the team," he has said.
Whatever he has become, this
much is without dispute: Funchess
has emerged as one of Michigan's
most dangerous offensive weap-
ons. Opposite fifth-year senior
Jeremy Gallon, he provides a big
presence and another top option
for redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner. Funchess is listed
at 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds, but
that's likely an underestimate.
Hoke recently described him as
6-foot-6 or 6-foot-7.
In the two games he primar-
ily played split wide, Funchess
has 11 receptions for 263 yards
and three touchdowns, stretch-
ing the defense in the process.
Against Minnesota, he gashed the
secondary for a 46-yard reception.
Against Penn State, he beat the

safety for a 59-yard score.
The success has made the move
seem obvious. As a blocker, Funch-
ess still needs time to mature. He
had become a burden to the run
game and a liability in pass pro-
tection. He is not yet big or strong
enough, Hoke said, and "you don't
want to puta square peg in a round

between tight end and receiver.
What they all share is a freak-
ish athletic ability - big enough
to be adequate blockers yet fast
and nimble enough to beat any
defender in the secondary. And so
NFL teams began cherry-picking
college basketball players who fit
that mold.

point stance any more. Everyone's
spread out."
"We're starting to inherit a dif-
ferent type of athlete from the
college ranks," Barone said. "It
isn't like the old days when those
guys were big, thick, square-body
blockers or guys that maybe played
linebacker in high school and col-

said. But by then, his position had
already begun to change.
Funchess played on defense,
mostly at defensive end. On
offense, he played at traditional
tight end on occasion, but he often
split out in what Herrington called
the "slot loose" formation. From
there, Harrison would throw to
him on a backside seam.
When Harrison split out four
receivers, Funchess was one of
them. Near the goal line, Her-
rington would put Funchess wide
on one side and Aaron Burbridge,
now a Michigan State receiver, on
the other. Either way Herrington
called, Harrison would have an
easy fade.
"He was really tough to cover as
a tightend when we sent him down
the field, you can imagine, against
a linebacker," Herrington said.
"Really no one at the high-school
level could defend against him."
The idea, then and now at
Michigan, is the same one behind
the new wave of NFL hybrid tight
ends. Against linebackers, Funch-
ess is too fast. When split out wide,
cornerbacks give up upward of five
or six inches.
In fact, Hoke said Funchess
matches up best against a corner-
back or safety. Against Minnesota,
Gardner boxed out a defender
six inches shorter than him for a
touchdown. On a 46-yard comple-
tion to Funchess later in the game,
Gardner easily threw over a cor-
nerback five inches shorter than
Funchess.
"It's kind of like pick your poi-
son," said fifth-year senior safety
Thomas Gordon, who has the
occasional pleasure of defending
Funchess in practice.
That suits Michigan just fine.
When sophomore receiver Amara
Darboh suffered a season-ending
injury in the preseason, the Wol-
verines scrambled to find a No. 2
option. After six games, the run-
ning game has failed to establish
any continued success.
And so more recently, the big
plays have come over the top to
Funchess. In the end, when he
has streaked past safeties for easy
scores, it doesn't matter what posi-
tion you call him.
Information from Arnie Staple-
ton of The Associated Press was
used in this report.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Sophomore tight end Devin Funchess has 11 receptions for 263 yards and three touchdowns in two games as a split wide out.

hole." But as a pass catcher, Funch-
ess has always excelled. So whytry
to make him something he's not?
In reality, though, the wheels
of change began lurching forward
when Funchess was still in pee-
wee, playing in the same league as
Gardner - his future quarterback.
As the National Football League
shifted to smaller, faster players,
hybrids have gained popularity.
Tony Gonzalez, who debuted in
1997, when Funchess was just 3,
changed the perception of the tight
end position. After him, Antonio
Gates and, more recently, Jimmy
Graham have blurred the line

And sure enough, Gonzalez,
Gates and Graham all played
hoops in college. (Gates spent time
at Michigan State for football and
basketball, and Eastern Michigan
for basketball before settling at
Kent State.) Soon, the prototype
of the modern hybrid tight end
trickled down to the collegiate and
high-school levels.
The NFL this year, through
the first five weeks, had the most
catches, yards and touchdowns
by tight ends ever. In college now,
said Clancy Barone, the tight ends
coach for the Denver Broncos, "It's
hard to find a tight end in a three-

lege."
As Gates had transformed into
the best tight end in the league
for the San Diego Chargers - and
one of the best offensive players
overall - Funchess entered high
school. Back then, like the new
wave of tight ends before him,
Funchess was a basketball play-
er. Herrington remembered that
Funchess thought of himself pri-
marily as a basketball player.
Basketball better fit his body
type. When Funchess arrived at
Harrison, he was a lanky teen-
ager who was "not very strong,
to tell you the truth," Herrington

IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SOUL

By EVERETT COOK
Daily SportsEditor
Michigan pass offense vs. Indi-
ana pass defense
As always, Michigan's offense
lives and dies with redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner. He's
going to make spectacular plays
and get his yards, but if he turns
the ball over as much as he has
been, the final score is going to be
a lot closer than it should be.
If Gardner can keep the ball out
of the Hoosiers's hands, the player
to watch is sophomore tight end
Devin Funchess.
The decision that offensive
coordinator Al Borges made to
move Funchess into more of a
wide receiver role has really paid
off - Funchess has 11 receptions
for 263 yards and three touch-
downs in his last two games.
Indiana's secondary has an
issue with finishing tackles
and plays mostly a man-to-man
defensive scheme, so the 6-foot-5
Funchess should have a field day
if the Hoosiers's secondary can't
wrap him up.
While underrated, Indiana's
secondary shouldn't be able to
stop Gardner, Funchess and Co.,
unless Gardner is handing the ball
over.
Advantage: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs. Indi-
ana rush defense
Other than Gardner, this hasn't
been a bright spot for Michigan.
Fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint is averaging
just 3.4 yards a carry and was bot-
tled up in Happy Valley, rushing
27 times for 27 yards.
Most of the woes can be blamed
on the offensive line, which has
been an utter disappointment so
far, so much so that a player Hoke
recruited as a left tackle, redshirt
freshman Erik Magnuson, could
be in the mix at left guard this
weekend. While highly recruited,
Magnuson also weighs 285 pounds
and doesn't have the mobility of a
typical guard.
In better news, Hoke said that
his All-American left tackle, fifth-
year senior Taylor Lewan, will be
playing this weekend after sitting

out the second half in State Col-
lege, which should help Michi-
gan's ground attack. This also
isn't a juggernaut defensive line -
Michigan State ran for 238 yards
against Indiana last week and is
allowing 4.6 yards per carry this
season.
So if Borges does what he said
he would do this week with Gard-
ner - which was run his quarter-
back as much as he could in order
to win the game - Gardner will
have a big day on the ground.
And as we've seen with this
Michigan team, if Gardner has
a good game on the ground, it
doesn't really matter what the
running backs are doing. His good
performance will mean a good
game for the rushing offense in
general.
Advantage: Michigan
Indiana pass offense vs. Michi-
gan pass defense
Indiana's offense is almost the
exact opposite of Michigan's. The
Hoosiers rely on two quarter-
backs, Nate Sudfeld and Tre Rob-
erson, and the offense runs almost
entirely from the spread. Sudfeld
- who is projected as the starter
on Saturday - is the more tradi-
tional passer, while Roberson has
just four more passing attempts
than rushing attempts on the
season. He plays mostly in short-
yardage and goal-line situations,
so in terms of the secondary, Sud-
feld is the man to focus on.
Sudfeld has had a very steady
year, completing almost 62 per-
cent of his throws, though-his
interception-to-touchdown ratio
(6:13) is high.
Indiana has a complementary
group of wideouts, six of whom
have more than 10 catches on
the year (for comparison, Michi-
gan has two). The Hoosiers also
have one of the biggest downfield
threats in the Big Ten in wide
receiver Cody Latimer, who is
averaging more than 15 yards per
reception.
This is a sneakily underrated
offense that has scored less than
40 points in a game just twice
this season and put up 44 points
on Penn State and 28 points on
Michigan State. Defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison is going to
