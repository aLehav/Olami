U' officials finalize policy on
Native Americanre mains

Senator Warren
makes proposal to
state Legislature
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily Ne ws Editor
In a proposal to the state
Legislature yesterday, state
Sen. Rebekah Warren (D-Ann'
Arbor) introduced a plan to
decrease the cost for Michigan
residents of attending a public
university in the state.
The bill - called Michigan
2020 - calls for the state to
individually grant $9,575, the
average cost of tuition at a pub-
lic university in Michigan, each
year to all students who previ-
ously completed K-12 education
at a public school in the state.
Students who only attended
Michigan public K-12 schools
for part of their schooling will
receive a percentage of the
$9,575.
Warren said the purpose of
the legislation is to incentivize
students to attend colleges in
the state and decrease student
debt, while ultimately prevent-
ing "brain drain" - the mass

exodus ot students trom tne
state following graduation.
"It's sort of our wonderful
recognition of, 'You're invest-
ing in Michigan, we're going to
invest in you as well,"' Warren
said.
Michigan 2020 is modeled
after the Kalamazoo Promise
which launched in2005, accord-
ing to Warren. The program
offers a four-year. scholarship
that pays for tuition and manda-
tory fees at 43 universities in the
state, including the University
of Michigan, to students who
completed grades nine through
12 in Kalamazoo Public Schools.
The announcement of the
new plan follows a public let-
ter University President Mary
Sue Coleman wrote to Presi-
dent Barack Obama last month
advocating college affordabil-
ity. Coleman wrote that higher
education funding should be
a priority for state and federal
legislators.
"Higher education is a pub-
lic good currently lacking pub-
lic support," Coleman wrote.

Collection of
artifacts to be
1 returned to tribes
ByAARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
The University announced
yesterday that it has finalized
its decision to return its collec-
tion of Native American human
remains and funerary objects,

15 years after formal dialogue
between the University and
Native American tribes began.
In 1990, Congress passed the
Native American Grave Pro-
tection and Repatriation Act,
which required all museums
possessing Native American
remains or funerary objects
to catalog and return them to
the tribes that were cultur-
ally affiliated with them. As a
result, some of the University
collection was returned.

Despite this requirement,
the University has remained
in possession of 1,600 remains_
and 16,000 funerary objects
that were culturally unidentifi-
able, according to a University
press release issued yesterday.
However, a federal court rul-
ing on May 15, 2010 mandated
that the University return
the culturally unidentifiable
remains and funerary objects
to tribes native to the area
where the remains were found.

Stephen Forrest, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
research, said the effort to
develop the policy behind
returning the remains has been
a community effort.
"You can't do this alone,"
Forrest said. "It (has been)
a large community effort to
make this thing come togeth-
er," he said.
Forrest added that the par-
ticipation of the Native Amer-

STUDENT AID
From Page 1

"There is no stronger trigger for
rising costs at public universities
and colleges than declining state
support."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in a statement
to The Michigan Daily that the
University is supportive of ini-
tiatives that assist students.
"It's always encouraging
when legislators focus on help-
ing Michigan students," Fitzger-
ald wrote. "We welcome more
dialogue about the best ways to
support student success."
Warren said she hopes the
program will prevent students
from leaving the state after grad-
uation, since they won't have to
worry about paying off as much
debt post-graduation.
"We have so many of our stu-
dents that get educated here and
then leave Michigan to go find
a job somewhere - else, and I'm
really hopeful that a program
like this ... will give students
the opportunity to stay here in
Michigan," Warren said.
As Michigan has continued to

accrue budget deficits over the
past decade, the state govern-
ment has decreased funding to
public universities by 65 percent,
subsequently driving up tuition
costs. Warren said a major initia-
tive of the Michigan 2020 plan is
helping to alleviate student debt
amassed from state public uni-
versities.
Warren said the program
would require $1.8 billion per
year and can be funded without
raising taxes, through initiatives
like reallocating a portion of the
$34 billion in tax credits the
state grants each year to Michi-
gan 2020.,
"Our plan is to create a com-
mission that would study those
$34 billion in tax credits and look
at them and say some of them we
might want to keep ... and some
of them have not reviewed in
years and maybe we don't want
to keep them anymore," Warren
said.
Warren added she is optimis-
tic that Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder will approve the plan if it
passed through the state House
and Senate, since his previous
budget and tax code revisions
included eliminating tax credits.

"I'm rather hopeful that the
Snyder administration would
find something like this could
be an attractive policy to sort of
investigate and see if they could
get behind," Warren said.
State Rep. Mark Ouimet (R-
Lyndon Twp.) said while there's
still a lengthy process preced-
ing implementation of the plan
- since the legislation has to
pass through individual coin-
mittees and the full state Senate
and state House - he is eager to
learn more.
"I'm looking forward to tak-
ing a look at it and seeing what's
involved," Ouimet said in an
interview yesterday.
LSA and Art & Design junior
Ian Matchett, a member of Occu-
py UM, said he would like to see
more information on how the
program will be sustained over
time, but thinks it's a big step for
the progress of the state.
"Fundamentally, this is some-
thing that needs to be dealt
with," Matchett said. "We need
to allow students to obtain a
public education in Michigan,
and that's something that's been
increasingly out of reach for
many people."'

an opportunity to go out and
maybe try a restaurant they've

never gone to before, and it
gives the restaurant a chance to
put its best foot forward."
Baru continued, "We're

McKee said. "We tried to make

LANSING
Snyder to deliver
budget proposal
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
will present his budget proposal
on Feb. 9, a spokesman for state
budget director John Nixon told
the Associated Press yesterday.
Kurt Weiss said the Republi-
can governor again will make the
budget presentation himself, as
he did last year, with Nixon aid-
ing in the presentation. A location
and other details still are being
worked out.
The 2012-13 budget proposal
covers the fiscal year that starts
Oct.1 and will be closely watched
to see if additional money is put
into areas that were cut in the
current budget. Critics say the
governor's first budget took too
much from public schools, uni-
versities, local governments and
social services. The current bud-
get also ended many tax breaks
for individuals and specific busi-
nesses while lowering business
taxes overall.
DETROIT
Police stations to
begin closing early
9 Fighting crime is a 24-hour job,
but Detroit police stations will be
sticking to business hours.
The department is rolling out
a plan to close precincts and dis-
trict headquarters to the public
after 4 p.m. It's an effort to put
more officers on patrol, especially
in the most besieged neighbor-
hoods, without adding to the
city's $200 million budget deficit.
The policy took effect this
week in an especially tough area
on the city's east side. Over the
next month, the practice will
spread to the six other stations.
At the first precinct to adopt
the new system, Michael Morris
stopped by to make al accident
report. He said he would reserve
judgment.
"Let's see the response time
on the street," Morris said. Then
he'll be able to say if it's working.

Amish men jailed
over safety laws
A group of Amish men were
sent to jail in western Kentucky
yesterday for refusing to pay fines
for breaking a state highway law
that requires their horse-drawn
buggies to be marked with orange
reflective triangles.
The men have areligious objec-
tion to the bright orange signs,
which they say are flashy and
conflict with their pledge to live
low-key and religious lives.
Ananias Byler, the first of 10
Amish men who appeared in
Graves County District Court
yesterday, was sentenced to 10

days in jail. The men were jailed
for being found in contempt of
court for refusing to pay fines.
Byler told Judge Deborah Crooks
Thursday that he would not pay
0 the $489he owes.
"I totally understand your
objection," the judge told Byler.
"But you're in violation, and it's
not up to me to change the law. It
doesn't really matter what I think
about any of this."
VIENNA
Iran to discuss
nuclear weapons
accusations
A seniqr U.N. nuclear agency
team will visit Tehran on Jan. 28
with Iran saying it is ready after
years of refusal to discuss allega-
tions that it was involved in secret
nuclear weapons work, diplomats'
said yesterday.
Diplomats have previously said
that International Atomic Energy
Agency officials were discuss-
ing such a trip with their Iranian
counterparts. But before the dip-
lomats' comments yesterday, no
date - or indication that Iran was
ready to talk about the allegations
- had been mentioned.
Any follow-through on the part
of Iran on its reported pledge to
discuss nuclear arms suspicions
would be significant.

Michigan 2020 reinvests in higher education
It's been said many times before, and it should be repeated until a
solution comes forth - the importance of higher education can-
not be understated. The state of Michigan and Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder have continued a decade-long trend and significantly cut
higher education funding over the past two years. College degrees
are critical to strong economies - an educated workforce brings
advanced technologies and jobs. A new plan introduced by Michigan
Senate Democrats has the potential to help more students afford col-
lege educations by subsidizing tuition. The state Legislature should
continue exploring the Michigan 2020 plan, and help put higher edu-
cation within reach of all Michigan residents. .

Yesterday, Senate Democrats, including
state Sen. Rebekah Warren (D - Ann Arbor)
unveiled the Michigan 2020 Plan. Along with
proposing an end to many tax loopholes for
corporations, the plan gives students who
attend public school in Michigan from grades
K-12 $9,575 - the median cost of tuition at
public colleges in the state - per year for
tuition expenses at any of the state's 15 public
universities.
The plan would be administered by the
Michigan Department of Education, and
implementation would cost an estimated $1.8
billion. The price tag may appear shocking, but,
its potential benefit to Michigan's struggling
economy exceeds the cost. Michigan's manu-
facturing and automotive markets have proven
unable to sustain jobs. As the country moves
toward a knowledge-based economy, Michi-
gan must move away from a manufacturing-
based economy. Investing in students now will
increase the state's competitiveness in emerg-
ing, lucrative fields in the future.
A smaller-scale version of the plan, pay-
ing for two years of tuition would cost signifi-
cantly less - an estimated $618 million. Only
subsidizing half of a degree, however, would be
detrimental to a student's education and hinder
Michigan 2020's success. A student would have
far less incentive to finish a degree knowing
state aid would cease after two years.
The proposal is based on the Kalamazoo
Promise, a privately financed tuition fund for

public school students entering its sixth year
in Kalamazoo, Mich. Michigan 2020 follows
the same basic structure as the Promise, which
has seen impressive results. Nearly 90 percent
of eligible students have enrolled in college.
That number greatly contrasts the 52 percent
of non-eligible Kalamazoo students enrolled.
Clearly, financial support allows more students
to attain higher education, and the benefit of
this to Michigan's economy will be seen in the
long run.
Last year, the state's funding to the Univer-
sity was cut by 15 percent, and state funding
has also dropped by 30 percent over the past 10
years. The cuts in public funding have forced
tuition increases, makinghigher education less
accessible to all.
Michigan should be focusing on higher edu-
cation, not continuously cutting public funds
to colleges. The state is ranked 42nd among
states on per capita higher education spending.
That ranking is unacceptable. It worsens the
state's brain drain as educated residents leave
for other states because few jobs opportunities
exist in advanced fields here, and it creates a
workforce unprepared for the future.
Michigan's responsibility to its students
shouldn't end after high school graduation.
The state, the University and the federal gov-
ernment need to refocus on making higher
education accessible. Despite high costs, the
Michigan 2020 plan puts students on the
right path.

Since Kim Kardashian is the
role model of the 21st cen-
tury, all women must want to
be just like her,
right? To be a
true Kardashian,
one has to emu-
late her voice,
and apparently
all women today
are doing this.
People are tak- ADRIENNE
ing notice of this ROBERTS
change. Numer-
ous commentar-
ies, studies and parodies regarding
the way in which young women
speak are nothing new. In the last
few years, however, discussions
regarding this topic have reached an
unprecedented level. From research
studies about the inflection of wom-
en's voices at the end of sentences
to trending on Twitter about #Shit-
GirlsSay, this cultural phenomenon
is here to stay. And I'm saying well,
like, it's all bogus. Seriously.
For decades people have assumed
that the "popular girls" on television
shows and movies are the sole sub-
jects of women's envy. When Alicia
Silverstone played Cher (a popular
high school student in California)
in the forever-quoted '90s movie
"Clueless," people claimed that the
rise of the phrases "whatever" and
"as if" - valley Girl Speak - was
due to the desire of young women
across the country to sound like
her. This Valley Speak is said to
persist throughout speech today.
In September, CNN wrote an arti-
cle describing how Valley Speak
is inhibiting women career-wise
because it's stopping them from
being taken seriously.
Apparently Cher is not women's
only inspiration - brainiacs like

Britney Spears and Ke$ha inspire
them as well. A September study
published in the Journal of Voice
describes a phenomenon called
vocal frying. Found in college
women, vocal frying is described as
a croaking and creaky sound given
to words, usually at the end of sen-
tences. Some singers use the tech-
nique in their songs, such as Lady
Gaga and Zooey Deschanel, and a
few celebrities speak using the tech-
nique as well.
While the study claims to apply to
women in college across the coun-
try, only 34 college females in New
York are examined. While these 34
women from New York obviously
do not represent the general col-
lege female population, this still
has become a national obsession
featured on major networks such as
ABC and NBC.According to reports,
many women supposedly look to
Kim Kardashian and Ke$ha for tips
on how to be cool when talking.
Not only do college women sup-
posedly croak words at the end of
sentences, they also say a variety
of the 100 or so phrases trend-
ing on Twitter as #ShitGirlsSay.
From "First of all, ew" to "Twin-
sies," women apparently love to
talk about well, shit. Conversations
about literature, politics and reli-
gion are topics that readers likely
assume women do not discuss on
a regular basis. A YouTube video
featuring phrases from the twit-
ter account @ShitGirlsSay shows a
man dressed in drag quoting Twit-
ter. The female clothing sends a
strong message that there is a dis-
tinct separation between the things
men and women say.
Classifying the way college
females speak is grossly over-exag-
gerated. Women do have other role

models than just the average gossip
columnist or narcissistic celebri-
ties. Britney Spears in "Oops I Did It
Again" is not a person most women
are striving to become. To say that
women are inhibiting themselves
career-wise because of the number
of "likes" they use in daily speech or
the inflection they place at the end
of their sentences is unjust and sim-
ply incorrect.
Women are likely
to be judged on
speech patterns.
This generalization is a reflec-
tion of the real problem - that
women are more likely than men
to be judged on many things, even
their way of speaking. Though many
women hold the "likes" and have
never said "as if," people assume
this type of speech is commonplace.
It's easy to make this claim, and
at times doing so asserts power in
a subtle way. Without specifically
saying this, society is able to claim
that young women are inferior to
men because of their unintelligent
speech that is perpetually influ-
enced by what they see or hear in
the media. Things like @ShitGirls-
Say may be funny, and women can
laugh along with it at times, but
really it's just plain sexist. Excuse
me though, I have to go, can't miss
"Kim and Kourtney taking New
York" tonight.

Advertising decisions

Last year the National Public Radio show
Freakonomics ran a 22-minute program
called "The NFL's Best Real Estate Isn't for
Sale." The podcast asked why a multibillion-
dollar franchise that has made astounding
revenues hasn't caved into advertising on
teams' jerseys.
The National Football League is the most
profitable sports league in the United States.
Owners, players and all involved love to make
money. They've branded and sold everything
from cup-cozies to flat-screen TVs. Yet, they
are unwilling to compromise the sacredness
of the game jersey. According to Freakonom-
ics, the NFL could bring in an Pxtra half a bil-
lion dollars a year if they sold advertisement
space on jerseys. The NFL forgoes this sub-
stantial pile of cash for one big reason - tra-
dition. NFL teams have always been brands
of their own, so while adding "Shop at Sta-
ples" across the front of their jerseys would
increase cash flow for the NFL, it would also
lessen the brand value of the specific team's
name.
Like everything else in this world, however,
the NFL has started to cave. They've allowed
sponsors to advertise on practice jerseys.
The NFL is one of the last organizations
to cave to advertising, at least on jerseys.
There are some establishments that have
been advertising since their inception - tele-
vision, magazines and newspapers. Others
have only recently started. Things that were
once valued because of their freedom from
advertisements suddenly have multitudes
of commercials. Buses are plastered with
movie posters and healthcgre ads. Highways
are sprinkled with billboards. Commercials
of every form have taken over the Internet,
which was once a free space of expression.

I know I'm not the only one who wants to
throw my laptop out the window when You-
tube puts an ad before my video of a sneezing
baby panda. Websites, mobile apps, Face-
book, Google, e-readers - not too long ago
all of these things were free of any obvious
industry sponsorship.
Just as advertisements have infiltrated the
Internet, they have become a driving force in
political campaigns. Everywhere I look I see
"Vote for Romney" - or whoever is the front-
runner this week. Ads on Youtube and televi-
sion that say nothing of substance are there
for the sole purpose of getting the candidates
name out. Debates on the issues are second to
the massive amounts of money poured into
publicity. Our presidential race has come
down to an ad campaign, like the latest sale on
jeans at Macy's.
In Scott Adam's book "The Dilbert Prin-
ciple," Adams explains how cell phone com-
panies use "confusifiles" - plans designed
specifically to confuse - and high rates of
advertisements to gain new clients. Clients
are so confused and overwhelmed that they
end up choosing the company or plan that
they've heard of the most.
The presidential race and other political
campaigns are the same thing. The issues are
so confusing, complicated and almost impos-
sible to understand, even for the candidates
themselves. Most voters don't even try to
understand the issues or their candidate's
position. They end up choosing based on
other factors - usually the amount of times
they have heard about candidate. The world
is in trouble when our decisions are based on
advertisements, not thought.

Predictions. Our society runs
on them. How much will
a gallon of gasoline cost a
week from now?
Which indus-
try will grow
the fastest?
How many tons
of wheat will
Americans con-
sume this year?
What will the
Dow Jones aver- KRISTEN
age be? KILUK
Or maybe a
little closer to
home: How long will I be on this
class waitlist? Where will I work
after graduation?
Accurately predictingthe answers
to these questions is vital to process-
es from structuring national policies
to the decision making of both busi-
ness leaders and college students.
All things on the predictabil-
ity scale, however, are not created
equal. For this reason, we employ
individuals to act as masters of pre-
diction in their fields. I'm not talk-
ingabout fortune tellers. I'mtalking
about mathematicians, social scien-
tists, natural scientists, politicians,
economist's and the like.
After they spend years pour-
ing over textbooks (sound famil-
iar?) and weighing all possibilities,
these specialists publish their find-
ings, their predictions. If we follow
their logic well enough, we adopt
their ideas and structure decisions
around them.
So, why do I raise this point?
Lately, I've found myself scratching
my head at the weather, and have
the feeling a lot of you may have
been, too. Though normally I would
predict the need for a winter jacket
when walking outside in the heart of
a Michigan winter, this has recently
resulted in overheating.

This brought to mind many pub-
lished predictions that claim that
extreme climate irregularities -
events from heat waves and cold
fronts to tsunamis and tornadoes
- may be a consequence of human-
induced climate change. The insur-
ance group Munich Re reported that
2011 endured the highest total dam-
age costs due to natural disasters
in recorded history - $380 billion.
This may be attributed to increas-
ing population and value of devel-
opment in storms' paths, but the
possibility that this trend may be
following climate scientists' predic-
tions can't be ruled out. So, are the
weird weather woes of 2011 attribut-
able to the dynamics of anthropo-
genic climate change?
In Enviornmental Protection
Agency's report Climate Change
Indicators in The United States
the term climate is defined as "the
average weather in a given place,
usually over a period of more than
30 years". Day-to-day weather is
inherently variable. So, climate sci-
entists focus their predictions on
climate trends instead of weather
observations. If you don't believe
me, just track the accuracy rates of
a weatherman's predictions.
For this reason, it's difficult to
correlate day-to-day occurrences
with climate change, and, unfortu-
nately, harder for us to contextual-
ize its impacts. Contrary to popular
belief, this does not demonstrate a
lack of credibility or evidence. It's a
more complex issue - the average
person can't accurately draw conclu-
sions about climatic trends without
knowledge of greater records.
The American political system
breeds us to believe many issues
have two distinct sides: pro or con,
red or blue. This is a dangerous
mindset to apply to climate change.
One should avoid pledging to simply

believe or not believe in the all-pub-
lished angles of the phenomenon.
Why is the global climate such
a big deal? It's not just a matter of
which jacket to wear or air condi-
tioning unit to install. It's a matter
of where and how food is produced,
which regions may be habitable in
the future, where resources may
shift and which organisms, includ-
ing humans, may or may not survive
on this planet.
Don't correlate
weird weather
with climate
change.
Climate scientists are still unsure
exactly how all of earth's ecosystems
and organisms will respond to an
increased presence of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. Still, it's a
complex and severe enough question
to justify continuation of and respect
. for their research. Whether you sup-
port every last detail or not, an abun-
dant set of data and predictions on
the topic of climate change will help
us come closer to the reality of our
situation, and continued research on
climate change is more important
than ever.
Human nature urges us to make
decisions based on predictions for
a reason - so that we can prepare
for the future as best as we can. I
don't know about you, but I'd like to
be prepared for this one. It's kind of
important.

Prominent Republicans
defend Romney's record

Fourteen-year-olds Sarah Collins and Nathalie Orozco walk in the snowfall at Cook Memorial Park in Libertyville, III yester-
day. The snowstorm was the first real snowfall of the season.
SMidwest prepares for ir
big snowstorm of winter

Huckabee, Giuliani
and others join
to campaign for
frontrunner
GREER, S.C. (AP) - An array
of Republicans and conservatives
- including some of Mitt Rom-
ney's sharpest critics - rushed to
the GOP presidential front-run-
ner's defense yesterday to coun-
ter efforts to paint the former
venture capitalist as a job-killer.
Under fire, Romney rival Newt
Gingrich backed off from directly
attacking Romney's tenure at the
helm of Bain Capital, but Rick
Perry defended his approach.
"We're disappointed" with the
line of criticism, said Thomas
Donohue, the head of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. The
business group doesn't endorse
in presidential campaigns, but
Donohue said: "We think Rom-
ney has had a pretty good track

record. Perfect? Hell no, but
damn good."
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee, who ran against Rom-
ney four years ago, wrote in an
online letter: "It's 'surprising to
see so many Republicans embrace
that left-wing argument against
capitalism." And another 2008
foe, former 'New York mayor
Rudy Giuliani, told Fox News
Channel: "I'm shocked at what
they are doing. I'm going to say,
it's ignorant. Dumb. It's building
something we should be fighting
- ignorance of the American eco-
nomic system."
Romney's new defenders -
many of whom have long his-
tories of disagreeing with the
former Massachusetts governor
- argued that the attacks on his
business record undermined the
GOP's identity and weakened the
party's chief argument against
Democratic President Barack
Obama, that federal intrusion has
stymied the economy's recovery.
And while the latest comments

were more a rejection of attacks
on Romney's record at Bain than
an endorsement of Romney as a
candidate, they signaled awarm-
ing toward Romney by a cross-
section of the GOP as his party
struggles to settle on a more con-
servative alternative. They also
signaled that attempts by ,Gin-
grich, a former House speaker,
and Perry, the Texas governor,
to cast Romney as a cold-blooded
predator in the business world
appeared to be backfiring badly
- and playing right into the Rom-
ney campaign's hands.
A prominent fundraiser in
South Carolina - Barry Wynn -
shifted his support from Perry to
Romney in light of those attacks,
which he said had crossed the
line in a political party that values
free-market capitalism.
"I've been fighting for this
cause most of my life," Wynn
said. "It's like fingernails on the
chalkboard. It just kind of irri-
tated you to hear those kind of
attacks."

Warm weather
gives way to several
inches of snow
MILWAUKEE (AP) - An
unusually mild winter finally
gave way to the Midwest's first big
snowstorm of the season yester-
day, blanketing a region unfazed
by a white Thanksgiving in a layer
of powder and pack that forced all-
too-happy snow plow drivers off
their couches and into the streets.
The storm dumped several
inches of snow on western parts of
Wisconsin and Iowa before mov-
ing eastward into Milwaukee, St.
Louis and Chicago, where up to
* eight inches were expected to fall
by this morning.
In a typical year, such a storm
would hardly register in the upper
Midwest. But the atmospheric
patterns, including the Pacific pat-
tern known as La Nina, that have
conspired to make this an unusu-
ally icy winter in Alaska have kept
it abnormally warm in parts of the
lower 48 states used to more snow.

For Steve Longo, a 47-year-old
chiropractor from Wauwatosa,
Wis., the wait to try out the cross
country skis he got for Christmas
was excruciating. He and friend
Alex Ng, 56, wasted no time in hit-
ting the trails at the Lapham Peak
cross country ski area, about 25
miles west of Milwaukee.
"I wasn't worried," Longo said.
"I was just anxious."
"This is Wisconsin," a confi-
dent Ng said. "There's going to be
snow."
The storm dumped 2 to 6 inches
of snow on eastern Iowa by Thurs-
day evening, and was expected to
drop 3 to 8 inches total on south-
ern Wisconsin and northern Illi-
nois as it moves further into the
Northeast on Friday, according to
Richard Castro, a National Weath-
er Service meteorologist.
While the dry weather has
been an unexpected boon to many
cash-strapped communities,
which have saved big by not hav-
ing to pay for plowing, salting and
sanding their streets, it has hurt
the seasonable businesses that
bank on the snow.


"If people don't see it in their
yards they are not likely to come
out and ski and snowboard so this
is wonderful, wonderful, wonder-
ful for us," said Kim Engel, owner
of Sunburst Ski area in Kewaskum
in southeastern Wisconsin, as she
watched the snow come down out
the window.
Rob Moser, a snow plow driv-
er from Elkhart, Ind., said he
couldn't wait for the flakes to start
to fall. The weather service said
lake effect snow could mean parts
of Michigan and northern Indiana
could get up to a foot.
"I love it. I make money plow-
ing snow and I'm all about snow-
mobiling, so I love it," Moser said.
"We haven't had enough snow to
do much."
The storm was an annoyance
for most commuters, and authori-
ties said it caused hundreds of
traffic accidents and at least three
road deaths - two in Iowa and one
in Missouri. And while some lucky
grade-schoolers cheered an unex-
pected day of sledding, hundreds
of would-be air travelers had to
scramble to come up with a Plan B.

World oil prices climb as Nigerian
union threatens to stop production

Strike part of
nationwide protests
in Africa's most
populous country
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) - A
major union threatened yester-
day to stop the beating heart
of Nigeria's economy - crude
oil production - as part of a
nationwide strike and protests
gripping Africa's most populous
nation.
World oil prices climbed on
the news. Nigeria is the fifth-

largest oil exporter to the U.S.,
and a shutdown would force
American refineries to replace
630,000 barrels per day of crude.
The union's ability to enforce
a shutdown, beginning Sunday,
across the swamps of Nigeria's
southern delta to its massive off-
shore oil fields, remains in ques-
tion. But the threat of a strike
caused jitters on global oil mar-
kets as traders worldwide wor-
ried about supply.
Nigeria has been paralyzed
by a strike that began Monday
after President Goodluck Jona-
than's government abandoned
subsidies that kept gasoline

prices low. Overnight, prices at
the pump more than doubled,
from $1.70 per gallon (45 cents
per liter) to at least $3.50 per
gallon (94 cents per liter). The
costs of food and transporta-
tion also doubled in a nation
where most people live on less
than $2 a day.
Anger over losing one of the
few benefits average Nigerians
see from being an oil-rich coun-
try, as well as disgust over gov-
ernment corruption, have led
to demonstrations across this
nation of 160 million people and
violence that has killed at least
10 people.

Tony Award-winner
to speak about
cultural issues
By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
Daily FineArts Editor
Heralded by publications like
Time Magazine as one of 2011's
best plays, "Chinglish" has been
said to capti-
vate its audi-
ence with A discussion
witty lines with David
and comedic Henry Hwang
exchanges.
Written by Today at 4 p.m.
playwright Michigan League,
David Henry Vandenberg Room
Hwang, the
show contin- Free
ues its run on
the Broadway stage, and Hwang
has traveled to the University to
talk about his newest hit and the
life of a playwright.
"I saw ("Chinglish") last
October] and I was really very
impressed because the premise
of it is how things can get lost
in the process of translation,"
said Joseph Lam, director of the
Confucius Institute and profes-
sor of Musicology at the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance. "It
was a well-written and flowing
experience. I got to talk to David
Hwang, and I thought, 'Why not

invite him (to the University)?'"
Born in Los Angeles, Hwang
studied at Stanford University
where his first play, "F.O.B.,"
premiered while Hwang was
still an undergraduate. He later
went on to enroll into the Yale
School of Drama.
Hwang's previous works'have
garnered him recognition in the
form of multiple Obie awards,
Pulitzer nominations and a Tony
Award for his best-known play,
"M. Butterfly."
Hwang's presentation today,
hosted by the University's Con-
fucius Institute, will focus on
his road to writing "Chinglish,"
as well as a discussion of play-
writing.
"The opportunity to talk with
an award-winning playwright is
a great opportunity," Lam said.
"It is a chance students inter-
ested in writing should not miss.
"(Hwang) is comingto explain
what he has achieved and to give
us a bit of his producer-and-
writer perspective on China in
America."
A recurringtheme in Hwang's
plays is the Chinese-American
identity and the clash of these
two cultures. Hwang's recent
play, "Chinglish," continues the
exploration of culture-crisis
by following a young Ameri-
can businessman on his trav-
els to China. Though the play's
comedic interludes stem from

tional mishaps, much of the play
is spent underlining the less-
obvious issues with communica-

"The problem isn't always a
matter of translation - some-
times it's not just about finding
a different word or a different
context, it's about intonation
and a physical aspect of lan-
guage," Lam said.
Hwang's talent as a play-
wright aids viewers in under-
standing the play, which is
largely spoken in Mandarin.
"Those that don't know Chi-
nese can really grasp the nuanc-
es and the issues in part due to
the creative dramatist work,"
Lam said. "(Hwang) was able
to insert humor and drama and
create a piece that is accessible."
The cultural variation in the
play reflects the differences
in upbringing in Western and
Eastern society - things that
are, at their core, fundamentally
"other." But in these seemingly
separate beliefs,.Hwang found a
way to connect the two areas of
the world.
"He really gets at the issues,"
Lam said. "Beside the language,
tradition and challenges of Chi-
nese values, the play discusses
questions of morality and love
and betrayal - all these really
deep human issues that are uni-
versal."

have people rethink their idea of
a collage by presenting a variety

"Collage" was the brain-child
of now-emeritus Gustav Meier,
director of the University Sym-

viewing a show in Belgium,
brought the idea back to Ann
Arbor.
The show consists of two sec-

quick switches between the dif-

reason for the concert's title.

'Collage
through present day," said con-
cert director John Pasquale.
"All without interruption of
applause."
In addition to an orchestra
and a 100-person choir, "Col-
lage" features performance
excerpts in vocal opera, jazz and
piano.
MT&D senior Emily Berman
describes the show as perfect
for "commito-phobes," or audi-
ence members without a decid-
ed music flavor, since the rapid
switches between different
genres and musical types mean
that the show usually caters to
every taste.
"It's a cross-section of all
of the amazing and different
things that are going on in the-
music school at once," Berman
said, who is performing for the
third time in this concert. "It
allows you to see very differ-
ent performances for very short
amounts of time."
Portions of
the School of
MT&D in one
performance.
The concert blends perfor-
mances from every department
of MT&D, using the large stage
at Hill Auditorium to accom-
plish this technical behemoth.
It's meant to be as much a
visual spectacle as an auditory
pleasure.
"'Collage' is always challeng-
ing from the technical end,"
said Emily Avers, director of
ensemble operations in MT&D.
"(It) presents a different puzzle
every year to produce ... this
requires an incredible amount
of preparation, organization
and patience, but the moment
that the pieces fall into place is
exhilarating."
Along with the pieces from
the various departments, which
will include a scene from the
play "The Beaux Stratagem"
and two musical theater pieces,
the concert will be interspersed
with original works by MT&D
students that have been select-
ed by the faculty.
"Many times, 'Collage' is a
patron's first experience with
the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance," Avers said. "So our
goal is for the audience to have
a good time, perhaps be a bit out
of breath at the end, and leave
Hill wanting to come back and
see more from our students and
faculty."

i; i ,s Blue readying for tune-up
prior to OSU outdoor game

Michigan coach Kevin Borseth s prepar ig his team to take on Big Ten opponent Minnesota
Sho ts fall Penn State's way

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team seems to be allergic
to the top 25.
The week of Dec. 5, the Wol-
verines
(2-2 Big MICHIGAN 63
Ten, 13-4 PENN STATE 78
overall)
were ranked 26th. Later in the
week, Michigan dropped the
Washtenaw County rivalry
game to Eastern Michigan,
77-64.
This week, the Wolver-
ines garnered four votes, put-
ting them in 31st. And just like
before, Michigan couldn't pull
through.
This time, they fell to No. 25
Penn State.
The Lady Lions (2-2, 12-4)
outhustled, outshot, and out-
played the Wolverines, while
poor shooting and defense
plagued Michigan. Penn State
won, 78-63.
After shooting 54 percent to
beat No. 8 Ohio State on Satur-
day, the Wolverines struggled
Thursdaynight, shooting just 34
percent from the field, including
'an abysmal 8-for-25 from long
range. Senior guard Courtney
Boylan, the team's leading scor-
er with 14 points per game, was
cold in the first half and finished
with just 10 points. And senior
forward Carmen Reynolds shot
just 2-for-10 from the field.
Even though shots weren't

falling, junior guard Jenny'Ryan
believes the team was getting all
the right looks on offense.
"We're just trying to make
things happen," Ryan said.
"When you go down early, you
want to get it all back in a hurry.
I think we got the shots, but
they just weren't falling for us
tonight. We had a lot of layups,
got what we wanted, but it didn't
go in. I can't say our offense
wasn't on, but it just wasn't our
night."
Michigan's bench tried to end
the shooting struggles, but their
efforts weren't enough. Junior
forward Kate Thompson was
the Wolverines' leading scorer
with 18 points, and freshman
guard Nicole Elmblad added
seven.
On the other hand, shots
were falling for Penn State. The.
Lady Lions shot 55 percent from
the field and hit 5-of-12 from
beyond the arc. The hot shoot-
ing was led by reigning Big Ten
Freshman of the Year Maggie
Lucas. -Lucas, who set the Big
Ten record for most 3-point-
ers in a season last year, lit up
the floor. She finished with 22
points, nine of which came from
beyond the arc.
"She's a shooter, she can pen-
etrate, she can hit the pull-up,"
Ryan said. "That's her job on
the floor. It helps her when her
teammates are hitting shots,
because it opens it up for her
and that's what was happening
(Thursday night). She got on a

roll early, and that's not a good
time for us."
Lucas' ability to get open was
aided by her teammates' strong
performances. Guards Zhaque.
Gray and Alex Bentley were
closely guarded by the Wol-
verines, which left Lucas wide
open. Though Lucas finished
as Penn State's leading scorer,
Gray and Bentley scored 15 and
12 points, respectively.
The Lady Lions also dominat-
ed in transition. They scored 24
points off of 13 Michigan turn-
overs.
Ryan, the Wolverines' defen-
sive spark, sat out much of the
first half with two fouls. With
Ryan on the bench, Michi-
gan struggled to contain Penn
State's transition game.
"Every time we missed a
layup, they made a layup," said
Michigan coach Kevin. Bors-
eth. "We missed a lot of layups.
They're very good in transition,
that's what they do. They have a
point guard (Gray) who can run
fast and outrun anybody down
the court. (We wanted) to get
two people back and double-
team her, and midway through
we did a good job."
With Minnesota up next, the
Wolverines will try to put this
loss behind them.
"Minnesota is really tough,"
Borseth said. "They're physical,
strong, very aggressive. A lot of
bumping and shoving in that
game, and we have to be ready
for that."

well-publicized outdoor event,
they will first play in Columbus.
While it may be easy for Michi-

on Friday, the Wolverines (6-6-4

stand how important that game
is, regardless of whatever is hap-
pening on Sunday.
"We are behind in the stand-
ings," said junior forward Chris
Brown. "We have to look at Friday
first, and that's our main priority.
Whatever happens, happens, then
we will look forward to Sunday.
But up until now, we are preparing
for Friday's game first."
Don't count on the Wolverines

In November, the Wolverines

Iowa represents potential trap game for Michigan

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
When the Michigan basket-
ball team slugged out a 60-52
road win at Iowa in 2008, Michi-
gan coach John Beilein probably
never would've guessed that four
years later, it'd still be his most
decisive win in Carver-Hawkeye
Arena.
After all,
it was hardly Michigan

the Big Ten.
To this day, that win from
Beilein's first - and worst - sea-
son in Ann Arbor may have been
the easiest he's been able to come
by at Iowa, and the only one that
ended in regulation. ,
In the following season, the
Wolverines blew a four-point
lead in the game's final minute
and were outscored 14-4 in over-
time.
Last season, it was Michigan
that came through with late-
game heroics, erasinga five-point
deficit in the final 22 seconds of
regulation before escaping Iowa
City with a two-point overtime
win.
And last year, thanks to 30
points from sophomore guard
Tim Hardaway Jr., the Wolver-
ines pulled out a 75-72 win in
overtime after the Hawkeyes
failed to connect on multiple

We have a really good team com-
ing in here."
The Hawkeyes are led by
steady senior guard Matt Gat-
ens, who leads the team with 13
points per game. But the recent
play of freshman forward Aaron
White - who is averaging nearly
11 points and five rebounds in
conference play - has garnered
attention by many around the
conference, including Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo.
"That No. 30 for them, White,
is going to be one hell (of a) play-
er," Izzo said after his team's win
over Iowa.
Saturday's game could get
particularly dangerous for the
Wolverines if they're not care-
ful. In what may be a trap game
for Michigan, the Hawkeyes
could jump on the Wolverines if
they show any signs of looking
forward to next Tuesday, when
Michigan will welcome the Spar-
tans to Ann Arbor in what could
be the program's most hyped
home game in well over a decade.
But Beilein - well aware of his
historic struggles in Iowa City
- is only focused on Saturday,
especially given the limited time
his team has to prepare for Iowa.
After Michigan played three
games in sevendays, culminating
in an overtime win over North-
western on Wednesday that saw
Hardaway and freshman guard
Trey Burke play all 45 minutes,
Beilein's team had Thursday off,
giving it just one day to get ready
for Saturday.
"We've- had to play really
hard," Beilein said. "It turns
right around at 12 o'clock on Sat-
urday afternoon. ... It's a difficult
challenge. I'd rather just think
about that than what's around
the corner."

Michigan coaih John Beilein has led the Wolverines to a quick 14-3 start in the 2011-12 season. Michigan goes toe-to-toe with Iowa in Iowa City on Saturday.

last-second 3-point attempts.
Beilein is well aware of the
challenges that come with going
on the road, especially in confer-
ence play. His team has yet to
win a true road test - Michigan's
only road win came at the Palace
of Auburn Hills, a neutral-site
game against Oakland, which
was technically the home team
despite its fans being outnum-
bered.
"Unless you have a team that
is so talented and such an incred-
ible rebounding team, it is just
difficult to win on the road,"
Beilein said. "Usually it takes a
few games, but this will be our
third true road game - four road

games overall. It takes a while,
but at the same time, all you need
is one to make it happen."
Hardawaywill look to improve
on his 30-point effort last year
- still a career high - and may
have added motivation to do so.
Beilein sparked interest in
the matchup between Hardaway
and Iowa sophomore guard Roy
Devyn Marble, when he offered
a look into his recruiting strate-
gies from two years ago.
"We were in a choice of
Devyn Marble or Tim Hard-
away," Beilein said. "We made a
choice with Tim. Obviously, we
wouldn't have gone wrong with
Devyn. Devyn's a tremendous

player."
Both Marble and Hardaway
were Rivals.com three-star pros-
pects. While in hindsight, it's
easy to look back now and say
that Beilein made the correct
decision, it wasn't always that
straightforward.
Coming out of high school,
Marble - a local talent out of
Southfield - was already 6-foot-
5, while Hardaway was just
6-foot-3. Hardaway, however,
has grown three inches and is
leading the 13th-ranked Wolver-
ines (4-1 Big Ten, 14-3 overall)
with 16 points per game. Marble,
though, averages just 10 points
for the middling Hawkeyes, who

Iowa (2-3, 10-8), who trailed
by as many as 45 points in East

the ship.
"We've got another chance
to play against a team that is
ranked, and play better and focus
harder," said Iowa coach Fran
McCaffery. "I expect us to play
better in a number of different
facets of the game. We have to.
