Professors
rally over
'U' shared
services

Dept. chairs and
faculty join to
oppose planned
centralization
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
With the University's
Shared Services Center sched-
uled to open next year, Univer-
sity officials have scrambled to
quell the fears of faculty and
staff amid a growing chorus of
complaints.
Since the beginning of
November, at least seven Uni-
versity departments have sub-
mitted letters to University
President Mary Sue Coleman
or Provost Martha Pollack
criticizing the University's
implementation and commu-
nication of the shared services
initiative.
The consolidation of servic-
es is a part of the Administra-
tive Service Transformation
Project, a cost-saving measure
that will transfer 275 depart-
mental human-resource and

finance staff to a centralized
location where the support
staff can be shared across
departments. Earlier this year,
the University hired Accenture
LLP, a major consulting fim,
to plot out how to implement
shared services, The Accen-
ture contract is valued at $11.7
million.
The initiative wss initially
expected to save $17 million
per year, but that estimate
has been reduced to savings
between $5 and $6 million.
On Wednesday, University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said the reduction in estimat-
ed cost savings came about
because administrators decid-
ed to decrease the extent of the
changes to services.
However, University faculty
members have voiced concern
focusingon the project's trans-
parency and equity, as well as
its consequences for the intel-
lectual environment of depart-
ments and academic units.
Some University employees
interviewed about shared ser-
vices agreed only to speak
anonymously due to the sensi-

Alum disscusses social role of University

Since G.A. Finch has been at the
University, he has been a partner at
Chicago-based lawfirm Hoogendoorn
E Talbot LLP and served as Chicago's
deputy planning commissioner, gen-
eral counselor to the Chicago Housing
Authority and now, as chief of staff
to Cook County Board President Toni
Preckwinkle.
You seem to be deeply involved
in public service, education being
of particular interest to you. Why
have you taken up such a role?
Well, I think public service is
something that everyone should
do. Whether they're serving for the
military or doing stints in the gov-
ernment sector, I think we all have a

duty to be active citizens.
The benefits of doing public ser-
vice are that it makes you a better
professional, a better leader to be
in these kinds of roles. You develop
a new skill set. You develop broader
relationships. I think it makes you
better at what you do, wherever you
come from. It's helped to me a better
counselor and adviser and advocate
for my clients.
What steps do you think need
to be taken by the University or
by the state government at large
to ensure the representation of
minority groups at institutions of
higher learning?
I think it's the responsibility of

the University community and the
administration to make sure there is
a nurturing, benign environment for
all students, whatever persuasion or
ethnicity or gender orientation.
In terms of the mechanics and the
practicalities of how you increase
the number of minorities, I think it's
critical to provide sufficient finan-
cial aid to anyone who has an ability
to get in and to succeed at Michi-
gan. But I think what's happened is
that because it's been tied to race
and ethnicity, it is being perceived
as giving advantages to particular
minorities to the disadvantage of
other ethnic groups of whatever per-
suasion. I think financial aid should
be tied to one's economic circum-
stances. Not all African Americans

are impoverished. Many come from
a solid middle-class and upper-class
background, and they don't need
financial aid. .
In terms of increasing minorities
at Michigan, I think Michigan has
a good story to tell and it needs to
be told better. My father, he went to
Michigan in the 1920s, and they've
always had African Americans going
to the University. And so I think
Michigan has a good story to tell;
that there is a long history of African
Americans matriculating and doing
well at Michigan.

Nuclear talks begin amid Iran's
warning of negotitation limits

U.S. officials seek
agreement through
bilateral meetings
despite tensions
GENEVA (AP) - A new round
of Iran nuclear talks began in fits
and starts Wednesday, with the
two sides ending a first session
just minutes after it began amid
warnings from Iran's supreme
leader of "red lines" beyond

which his country will not com-
promise.
Still, both sides indicated a
first-step agreement was pos-
sible on a deal to roll back Iran's
nuclear program in exchange for
limited sanctions relief, despite
strong opposition from Israel
and unease in both Congress and
among Iranian hard-liners.
President Barack Obama
appears determined to reach such
an agreement, which could be a
major step toward reconciliation
between the United States and a

former ally that turned adversary
after the Islamic Revolution of
1979.
But America's longtime allies
Israel and Saudi Arabia fear a deal
will fall short of ending the Ira-
nian threat and that a resurgent
Iran will transform the balance
of power in the Middle East.
A senior U.S. official said
Wednesday's brief plenary was
only a formality and that bilateral
meetings would continue through
the evening to try to hammer
out the first steps of a deal. She
demanded anonymity under U.S.
government briefing rules.
However, there was also tough
talk, reflecting tensions from
nearly a decade of negotiations
that have begunto make headway
only recently.
While voicing support for the
talks, Iran's supreme Leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, insisted
there are limits to the concessions
Tehran will make. And he blast-
ed Israel as "the rabid dog of the
region" - comments rejected by
French President Francois Hol-
lande as "unacceptable."
French spokeswoman Najat
Vallaud-Belkacem told report-
ers in Paris that such statements
complicate the talks, but France
still hopes for a deal and its posi-
tion has not changed. At the pre-
vious round earlier this month,
France said it wanted tough con-
ditions in any preliminary deal
with Iran, and those negotiations
then ended with both sides speak-
ing of progress but continued dif-
ferences on a final agreement.
Khamenei gave no further
details in a speech to a paramili-
tary group aimed at both placat-
ing hard-liners and showing his
backing for the Iranian officials
meeting with international nego-
tiators in Geneva. But his men-
tion of Iran's "nuclear rights" was
widely interpreted as a reference
to uranium enrichment.
For his part, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
pushed ahead with criticism of
what he asserts is a deal in the
making that will give Iran too
much for too little in return.

dents with students from
the Jalen Rose Leadership
Academy, a public charter high
school on the Northwest side of
Detroit founded by the former
Michigan basketball player of
its name. Merit, the business
side, donates 20 percent of its
revenue toward scholarships
awarded to mentees who par-
ticipate in FATE.
The store opened its doors
South University Avenue ear-
lier in the month, but officially
joined the Ann Arbor business
community in a ribbon cutting
ceremony Wednesday night.
The ceremony began as Com-
pulsive Lyres, a University a
cappella group, performed out-
side of the storefront. Univer-
sity alum Kuhu Saha, founder
of FATE, addressed the audi-
ence gathered on the sidewalk,
thanking them for their sup-
port.
The ribbon was cut by Jan-
Ida Ripton, a student at the
Jalen Rose Leadership Acad-
emy. Ripton told the crowd
that the opportunities offered
by the FATE program and that
the promise of a $5,000 college
scholarship, raised by Merit
revenues, has encouraged her

aspirations to attend New York
University and study theater.
Merritt gave remarks after Rip-
ton's address.
"When David and Kuhu first
came to the Jalen Rose Leader-
ship Academy and talked about
how the program would help
students get to college, I was
just awestruck and said, 'I just
need to enter this program,' "
Ripton said. "I love the fact that
we get to visit different organi-
zations and businesses and get
to go outside our community."
LSA senior Dailyn Foster,
president of FATE, said the men-
torship and outreach program
has done its part by spreading
the word through social media
and other means.
"Part of our mission is to
support the store," Foster said.
"The whole purpose is so that
kids get scholarships ... and get a
chance to go to college."
Ann Arbor resident Suzanne
Upton, who has a daughter in
high school, came to the open-
ing to support the new business
in the community.
"I think the way David put
it - that you're wearing a badge
that supports something larger
than yourself - is kind of cool,"
Upton said.
Members of the Ann Arbor
Chamber of Commerce were
also present at the event. Joey

Blaszczyk, membership sales
representative of the chamber,
said he respects the fact that
Merritt chose to return to Ann
Arbor to establish his business.
"They give back so much to
the youth, funding so many
scholarships - really going out
of the way to make them suc-
ceed is what makes them stand
out," Blaszczyk said.
Merritt said he wants to
expand the store by opening an
outlet in Detroit, which he pre-
dicts will happen in the next
12-to-18 months. Marketing the
brand is a part of the process,
and much of it will rely on get-
ting word out to University stu-
dents.
"So many of our U of M stu-
dents are so dedicated to giving
back, that we can connect with
them on that, and know that
we're going to connect fashion-
wise with a lot of students,"
Merritt said. "We're trying to
get the best of both worlds -
whichever hits the heart - so
we can hopefully become a fab-
ric of the community."
Zingerman's and Google,
which have provided workshop
to FATE mentees, have signed
on as two of the 20 community
partners supporting Merit.

Claiming the court
Shifting power away from Ingham County court is a political move
n Tuesday, Nov. 12, Gov. Rick Snyder signed into law a bill that
ends Ingham County Circuit Court's tenure as Michigan's Court
of Claims. Public Act 164 moves the Court of Claims out of the
Ingham County Circuit Court to the Court of Appeals and expands the
court's jurisdiction. The new, expanded Court of Claims will now han-
dle hundreds of cases from the state, including challenges to Michigan's
Open Meetings, Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights and Freedom of Information
Acts - a significant expansion of its scope. Yet, the Court of Claims jurists
are handpicked by a group of Republican judges. It makes sense that an
Ingham County court should not have the authority to make state deci-
sions; however, the real reason for shifting responsibility is questionable,

There are very few graduat-
ing seniors who have had
a linear path through col-
lege. The vast
majority of
undergraduates
utilize their time
at Michigan and
the years fol-
lowing to find
themselves and
create their
future career. TIMOTHY
Frequently, this BURROUGHS
involves some
reevaluation and
plan changes along the way. While
not all of us can follow the Mark
Zuckerberg model of capitalizing
on a good idea early, understand-
ing our individual strengths allows
us to discover our own niche where
we can be successful.
University alum David Portnoy
understands this as well as anyone:
He's the owner and founder of the
popular website and franchise Bar-
stool Sports. Perhaps better known
by his alternate persona, El Presi-
dente, Portnoy developed the Bos-
ton-based blog, which is devoted to
sports, pop culture, YouTube videos
and plenty of scantily clad women.
Although it has hardly been a direct
path for Portnoy, his site now receives
more than 75 million page views a
month and has become extremely
profitable through the combination
of advertising, the Barstool Blackout
concert tour and original apparel
sales. Portnoyharnessed his previous
career skills in sales and marketing to
capitalize on the "fraternity" culture
of 18-to-35-year-old males. Portnoy's
success exemplifies how capitalizing
on our personal strengths and under-
standing target audiences can lead to
entrepreneurial success.
Portnoy, who was originally only
accepted to the School of Nursing
at Michigan, quickly transferred
into LSA after arriving on campus.

Unable to pass the undergraduate
language requirement, he trans-
ferred again into the School of Edu-
cation, where he graduated with
no intention to become a teacher.
Though never a member of Greek
Life at Michigan, Portnoy lived
in West Quad Residence Hall his
freshman year where he befriended
members ofthewrestlingteam, who
became his close friends through-
out his undergraduate career. Port-
noy began working in sales after
graduation where he gained experi-
ence pitching ideas to prospective
advertisers and an understanding of
how to maintain an audience and a
market for his product.
The original Barstool Sports site
launched in 2007 when a fan of the
original newspaper version moved
to New York but still wanted access
to Portnoy's product. Back when
blogs were still something you
didn't want in your plumbing, this
avid fan created a site where Port-
noy could upload content in a PDF
format and effortlessly post it to the

ence, Portnoy admits the biggest
surprise was how popular his writ-
ing became.
"I was never supposed to be
a writer, but the things people
responded to the most were sto-
ries from my personal life, so I just
followed it," he said. Being able to
adapt to what fans want has been
a consistent goal of Barstool. The
blog, which claims to be "by the
common man, for the common
man" has never feared trying new
ideas, but constantly evaluates what
works well and what falls short.
The site now includes separate
blogs for New York, Philadelphia,
Chicago, the Washington D.C. and
Baltimore area and, recently, Los
Angeles. Barstool Blackout Tours,
which started as a party series at
fraternities, has expanded into
a huge money maker, featuring
shows across the nation including
the University of Michigan. Bar-
stool has also expanded into origi-
nal YouTube content through "The
Bro Show" which Portnoy feels
could turn into the

and most likely politically minded.
While the conservative Michigan Supreme
Court appointed two Republicans and two
Democrats to the Court of Claims, its com-
position could change and is now open to
manipulation in the future. Thus, partisan
legislation could easily be pushed through
by whatever political party holds a majority
on the court. Even Bruce Timmons, a long-
time Republican staffer for the House Judi-
ciary Committee, said the new law is "rigging
the deck against those who have to appear
in court." And now, an increased number of
important state cases will be decided by Sny-
der-approved judges rather than being filed at
local circuit courts. The new Court of Claims
will assume immediate control of important
pending cases, including Detroit's right to cut
retirement benefits and the legality of a tax
on teacher pensions.
While state officials claimed that this
move was made simply to make the process
more democratic, the governor and Michigan
Supremse Court are granted more power. There
are other ways to make the Court of Claims pro-
cess less partisan that were apparently ignored.

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) intro-
duced an amendment that would have the four
judges selected by "blind draw." That amend-
ment, however, was shot down. There are only
three states where the Court of Claims falls to
the judicial branch. In New York, the Court of
Claims is its own independent court. This is not
the case in Michigan, where the separation of
powers between government branches is slow-
ly becoming nonexistent.
Snyder is clearly attempting to thwart judi-
cial review of the legislation he backs. Just
like the emergency manager law, which was
quickly pushed through the legislature, the
Court of Claims reform was introduced in
October and passed into law a month later,
stifling public debate.
This law, in theory, makes sense. How-
ever, its ostensibly sensible purpose is over-
shadowed by the blatant power grab by
conservatives seeking to protect their own
controversial reforms. The Court of Claims
is now open to partisan influence by the gov-
ernor and the state Supreme Court, and this
power can easily be misused in the future.

Let us not lose sight

In 2013, about 80 percent of
American teenagers have cell
phones and more than 90 percent
have a computer or access to one at
home. The digital economy alone in
the United States requires a massive
and growing amount of energy. This
is in contrast to sub-Saharan Africa,
where 589 million - or nearly seven
out of10 - people do not have access
to even the most basic electric-
ity. It may be hard to discern, over
the sound of the average American
teenager complaining about how his
or her iPhone desperately needs a
charge, just how desperate the situ-
ation is in sub-Saharan Africa.
Close to 90 million students have
no electricity at school in Africa;
they learn in locations without air
conditioning or ventilation. About
70 percent of businesses cite the lack
of access to reliable power asa major
constraint; small business own-
ers are often forced to repair and
replace equipment without electric
tools. Almost 225 million people of
sub-Saharan Africa rely on health
facilities that are without electric-
ity. After mothers give birth in the

dark, there are seldom incubators
in which they can place their babies
for warmth, or respirators for peo-
ple who cannot breathe on their
own, or-electrocardiographytests
to find the source of unexplained
chest pain. Families struggle to
preserve food and cook without
refrigeration and adequate heat,
and many consume water that isn't
potable because it simply cannot be
sanitized.
Education, medicine and eco-
nomic development all demand
access to electricity, and sub-
Saharan Africa can't be expected
to progress without this access. It's
tremendously unfair for sub-Saha-
ran Africans to have to contend
with this burden solely because of
where they were born. Hope for
the future lies in the congressional
enactment of the Electrify Africa
Act, part of a bipartisan initiative
called Power Africa, which will
hold the United States responsi-
ble for creating a "comprehensive
strategy to help increase electric-
ity in sub-Saharan Africa," which,
among other things, includes

encouraging the U.S. Agency for
International Development to use
programs that are already in place,
like loan guarantees, partnerships
and grants, to increase electricity
in sub-Saharan Africa, and induc-
ing the World Bank, African Devel-
opment Bank and Overseas Private
Investment Corporation to pri-
oritize and increase electrification
and electrical sector investments in
sub-Saharan Africa.
It goes without saying the Elec-
trifyAfricaAct,whichcosts the U.S.
taxpayer almost nothing and relies
mainly on renewable energy sourc-
es, is a huge step toward attaining
modern energy for sub-Saharans.
It's not, however, one large enough
to fill the vacuum. In fact, without
new efforts, almost half of the sub-
Saharan population will not have
access to power in 2030. Surely
one of the richest countries on the
planet can afford to take further
measures to help supply the world's
poorest obtain what has undeniably
become a necessity of life.
Sara Isaac is an LSA sophomore.

When I walked into Mason Hall this morn-
ing for my political science research design
class, I stopped in my tracks and looked at the
black construction paper that replaced the
usual posters and flyers advertising events
on campus. I saw African American students
gathering to write messages with chalk about
their experiences, both positive and negative,
about being students of color at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. I picked up a piece of light
blue chalk, placed it on the black paper, and
stood for a few minutes. After thinking about
what I wanted to write, I put the piece of
chalk back down, leaving the space empty.
Throughout my class, I thought about what
I wanted to write and then realized that a
few words would not do justice in explaining
how I feel as a biracial student on campus.
Throughout my life, people have always ques-
tioned my race. At times, I have wondered if it
is out of genuine curiosity or just plain igno-
rance. For some reason I never understood
why people were infatuated with my hair or
so quick to ask which one of my parents is
white. And then it dawned on me - it is ambi-
guity that the human race is fascinated with.
As a junior at the University, I have never
felt particularly comfortable identifying with
one racial group over another. Although I
have been a member of a few Black student
organizations, at times I felt that I was not
worthy because I grew up in a predominately
white environment. Because of this, among
other reasons, I did not join a Black soror-
ity or the Black Student Union. I was simply
afraid that I would stand out as an anomaly.
I can admit that these are two regrets I have
as someone graduating from the University
next year.
It was not until yesterday morning, when
the #BBUM trend on Twitter sparked nation-
al attention, that I could finally breathe a sigh
of relief. It reassured me that other students
shared similar feelings to my own and that
they recognized the same problems I have
noticed since I stepped foot on campus. As
I read through tweets, Facebook posts and
handwritten messages in Mason, I had an
"aha!" moment: It dawned on me that being
biracial at the University means that while I

can sympathize with the frustration of Black
students, Iam also conscientious of how white
students feel about the racial climate on cam-
pus. It made me realize that it is my respon-
sibility to support movements that empower
minorities, while also understanding that
other students, including those who are
white, do not always feel safe and welcomed
in classrooms and student organizations.
I am not blind to the racial issues and cer-
tainly not to the lack of diversity on campus,
but it would be unfair to solely blame the
University. We must do something to cre-
ate change. In forming a movement, let us
not forget that we attend a world-class insti-
tution - an institution that certainly has
imperfections - but also has opportunities
many could only dream of. An institution
with a rich history of inclusion. An institu-
tion faced with bureaucratic challenges that
often make problems difficult to solve. An
institution that allows all students, including
those of color, the opportunity to be a part of
something bigger than ourselves.
Let me be clear that I have had wonderful
experiences at Michigan and have had oppor-
tunities that I am incredibly grateful for. I
have heard President Barack Obama speak,
traveled to Guatemala to volunteer on a medi-
cal mission trip, listened to the struggle and
life story of Jose Antonio Vargas, watched my
friends dance in cultural shows, and of course,
cheered on the football team in the Big House.
I have been taught by renowned professors
and sat in on lectures with famous authors.
This being said, it is easy to get caught up in
the school's prestige, and lose sight of issues
that affect many students including myself.
I want my voice to be heard, and I want oth-
ers to know that it is OK to not feel completely
comfortable in one racial group. Being biracial
is something that has shaped the person who
I am, and how I identify myself at Michigan.
I encourage all students, especially students
of color to continue to generate a movement.
In doing so, I hope that we reach out to other
students, and rather than strengthen racial
divides, work to loosen them.

tivity of the matter.
In a Nov. 1 letter obtained
by The Michigan Daily, 19 LSA
department chairs and program
directors called on University
leadership to arrange a meeting
with department representatives
to address concerns related to
shared services.
The letter was addressed to
Coleman; Pollack; E. Royster
Harper, vice president for stu-
dent life; Timothy Slottow, exec-
utive vice president and chief
executive officer; and Laurita
Thomas, associate vice president
for human resources.
The signatories listed three
main concerns with the project's
implementation. First, the chairs
and directors said they should
have been consulted earlier in
the decision-making process.
Second, they claimed the proj-
ect has been characterized by an
aura of secrecy, which spiraled
rumors and increased anxiety
among staff.
Third, the departmental
leadership said shared services
"amounts to a dehumanization
of the workplace." The authors
were also concerned that most of
the affected employees are pre-
dominantly women from lower-
income backgrounds.
"In a recent communication,
President Coleman writes that
the 'Victors for Michigan' cam-
paign 'starts with the heart of
our university - the faculty and
staff who dedicate themselves
to excellence at Michigan.' We
agree with the sentiment whole-
heartedly, and respectfully
request that AST be implement-
ed with the respect and appre-
ciation the staff members at the
heart of the institution so richly
deserve," the letter said.
Silke-Maria Weineck, chair of
the Department of Comparative
Literature, said in an interview
that University administrators
had cleared their calendars for a
meeting during the week leading
up to the Victors for Michigan
campaign launch. Pollack, Slot-
tow and Thomas attended the
meeting, which took place on
Nov. 7.
"They responded immediate-
ly, and they responded with great
openness," Weineck said. "I
think it was a very constructive
meeting. Martha Pollack seemed
very open and acknowledged
that mistakes had been made.
They asked many times what can
we do to make this better."
Weineck said LSA's depart-
ment leaders' most significant
demand was a promise of no lay-
offs.
While the administration
could not commit to this promise
at the meeting, University lead-
ers announced in a Nov. 14 letter
that no layoffs would result from
the transition to a shared servic-
es center.
Before the University made
this announcement, many Uni-
versity staff members were con-
cerned as uncertainty mounted
in their departments.
In an anonymous letter sub-
mitted to a department chair

ward, particularly in the fields of
research and patient care.

to have administrative skills
in health care and health-care
delivery, because with all of
the changes in health care and
health-care reform it's becom-

- who wished to remain anony-
mous speaking about AST - one
day before the administration's
announcement, an employee
expressed anxiety related to the
minimal information provided
regarding her future at the Uni-
versity.
"I cannot even tell you how
anxious and worried and sick
this charade has made me,"
the employee wrote. "I cannot
sleep. I do not know what I will
do if I find myself without a job
next year. I have worked for the
University a long time. I am not
'young' and I have family who
relies on my job. I do not know
what will happen to us. I try so
hard to do a good job and I've
never received a bad job review
or have been reprimanded about
anything about my job perfor-
mance, ever."
The administration addressed
issues surrounding communica-
tion in their letter distributed to
faculty and staff.
"It is clear we were not sensi-
tive or consultative enough in
the planning and communica-
tion of this initiative," the state-
ment said. "We deeply value
every member of the university
community, and regret that the
early stages of the process did
not live up to our shared values."
Even after the University
promised no layoffs would occur,
faculty members continued to
send letters regarding the antici-
pated effects on their respective
departments.
"However important as this is
for the targeted staff, the crisis
we now confront as a university
and a community is less a crisis
of money than a crisis of values,"
a letter from the Women's Stud-
ies Department said.
The letters expressed disap-
pointment in the University's
decision to pull valued staff from
their departments. In some cases,
impacted staff members have
worked in their departments for
more than three decades.
"From our perspective, AST
will disconnect vital individuals
from our departments and ware-
house them in remote locations,"
the Department of American
Culture letter said. "While the
AST architects have attempted
to give this a nice gloss, we view
these new working conditions as
unacceptable, promising a grim
existence that others have com-
pared to an 'accounting sweat-
shop."'
American Culture Prof. Alex-
andra Stern said moving key staff
to an off-site call center would
immensely damage the depart-
ment's everyday functions.
"There's a lot of local knowl-
edge in departments," Stern said.
"Departments are organic com-
munities where there's a lot of
on-site problem solving."
She said a move toward shared
services could decrease, rather
than improve efficiency.
Staff not only handles finan-
cial and human resource tasks
but also plays a key role in coor-
dinating the inner workings of
University departments.
With these employees relo-
cated, Stern said faculty would
need to spend a greater propor-
tion of time handling paperwork,

ing more and more of a challenge
to be able to run successful large
clinical programs," Wicha said.
After leaving, Wicha plans
to spend more time personally
treating breast cancer patients,
along with conducting more can-
cer stem cell research. In 2003,
his lab discovered breast can-
cer stem cells that are resistant
to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy - leading Wicha and

systems or scanning.
"I'm not whining or complain-
ing about this," Stern said. "I'm
not saying that faculty shouldn't
do their share of needed work for
their own projects and their own
teaching. I think it could have an
impact on the quantity of time
faculty can spend with students,
which none of us want."
Though Weineck, the Com-
parative Literature chair, will
not lose any employees in her
department to the shared servic-
es center, she, like other faculty
members, has felt affected by the
transition.
"I've noticed that even staff
members who are not affected
at all have taken this as a very
worrisome institutional process
by which they feel threatened,"
Weineck said. "There has been
a certain kind of understanding
that we are community. We do
care for each other and this pro-
cess seems extraordinarily cold."
In an interview with the
Daily, one LSA chair who wished
to remain anonymous said her
department's staff convened in
her office, together with their
one staff member told she would
be transferred to a shared ser-
vices center. They cried together.
"This is real pain," the chair
said. "They are the heart and
soul of this department."
On Wednesday, Pollack met
with individual departments,
including American Culture.
American Culture faculty
asked the University to postpone
the shared services transition
for one to two years - a period
after the University's next presi-
dent and permanent LSA dean
assume office, according to a fac-
ulty member present at the meet-
ing with the department. That
timeframe would allow faculty
and staff to participate in the
decisions surrounding a shared
services transition.
The faculty members also
requested no staff in their
department be transferred to the
shared-services center until the
end of that period.
"The meeting with Pollack,
who seems like a very nice and
completely reasonable person,
went well in a way - that is,
everything was communicated
honestly and cordially on both
sides of the fence," said a profes-
sor who wished to remain anon-
ymous. "But it was also kind of
depressing because of course no
decisions were actually made."
Weineck said she sees the
shared services conversation as
an opportunity to strengthen
ties between faculty and Univer-
sity officials.
"I'm quite hopeful," she said.
"I think this process has been on
the whole a positive experience
because it opened up channels of
communication between faculty
and several administrators that
weren't there befor."
As Universities across the
nation begin to adopt shared ser-
vices models, Weineck hopes the
University will choose an alter-
native course.
"My hope is that Michigan,
rather than joining the trend,
can actually establish itself as
the University that does things
differently."

opment of new drugs that can
attack stem cells.
"My hope is that even over the
next decade many of the treat-
ments we use now such as che-
motherapy will become obsolete,
and that our treatments will be
much more tailored to individual
patient's tumors and the thera-
pies will be much less toxic than
what we have today," Wicha said.

charged party theme.

HEARING
From Page 1A
Allen Wu, who created the Face-
book event, represented Theta
Xi at the hearing.
For considerations of sanc-
tions against the fraternity, the
plaintiffs stressed to the panel
that even if the members of the
fraternity may not have known
the event could cause harm to
certain people and groups on
campus, the impact was more
important than Theta Xi's
intent.
Quang, however, said it was
more important for the panel
to take the intent of the party,
which was not malicious, into
consideration rather than the
final impact. He and Wu also
emphasized that the party was
of Wu's creation, not the frater-
nity's, and that the fraternity
as a whole should not suffer as
a result of one individual mem-
ber's actions.
"Anything that we put on the
Internet we're responsible for,
and we'd like to take responsibil-
ity for those acts," Quang said.
"As a fraternity, I'd only like to
take responsibility for the spe-
cific problems we have caused."
Fischer said it was obvious
that Quang and Wu still don't
fully understand the effects of
the party. She believes the fra-

ternity should take full respon-
sibility for the event and its
ramifications on the entirety of
the University community.
In addition to the insensitive
concept of the party, the plain-
tiffs argued that the steps Theta
Xi leaders took to remedy the
situation, including an apology
issued by Quang and aViewpoint
printed in The Michigan Daily
authored by Wu, displayed a lack
of understanding of and discon-
nect from the reality faced by
many students on campus.
"This hearing is important
because I want to make sure
other students always feel as if
they are a valued member of our
Michigan community," Fischer
said.
"Yes, we were angry, and yes,
I am still angry," said Thomas. "I
am not Black; I am not a woman
... I have never directly experi-
enced racism or sexism, nor will
I ever. I am still upset."
Nagy told the panel that she
brought forth the complaint to
open up a dialogue about the
issues that still plague cam-
pus. She pointed to #BBUM,
the Black Student Union's viral
Twitter campaign, as evidence
of the impact that raising one's
voice against perceived injus-
tices can have.
Wu and Quang both acknowl-
edged that they needed to edu-
cate themselves on racial and

who were present at the can-
dlelight vigil, Ramos has fam-

her family lives in the western
Visayas region - an area devas-
tated by the storm.
"Thankfully, all of my family
is pretty safe, but my parents'
hometown was hit pretty hard
and is in need in a lot of support
right now," Ramos said.
Another focus of the event
was the impact that Americans
have upon climate change and
how this affects others, such as
those in the Philippines.
Public Policy junior Marissa
Solomon said Americans pro-
cess of production is "fossil fuel-
heaving," producing excessive
carbon dioxide and resulting in
climate change.
"This is causing a lot more

sexist issues on campus.
"Moving forward, I definitely
look forward to education and
I really hope that can help me
become more conscious and
aware of the social issues that
people on this campus are fac-
ing," Wu said during a cross-
examination. "I hope that
through this education my fra-
ternity members and myself just
become more aware and respon-
sible for our actions."
After the hearing Quang said
there is much more to learn "for
the parties involved and for the
University."
"I'm glad to open the conver-
sation," he said. "And I believe
not only for the perpetrators of
the harm but just for everyone,
there's a lot to be learned."
Members of the panel asked
questions of both the plaintiffs
and defendants, but did not
make formal statements regard-
ing the case.
After the hearing ended,
Thomas said that it was impor-
tant to have a formal hearing
against Theta Xi so future orga-
nizations could have a record
to look to if similar issues arise
again.
"I think that (members of
Theta Xi) are trying very hard to
have their minds open," Thomas
said. "I am hopeful that they are
as receptive as possible to all
positive change that can occur."
natural disasters," she said.
Solomon said students can
decrease their impact on the
environment by making small
changes, such as unplugging
electronics when they are not in
use. However, she said changes
in policy would have a bigger
impact and encourages students
to urge politicians to make
changes that will benefit the
environment.
FASA sold $5 wristbands
after the vigil to raise money for
the Philippine Red Cross and
Advancement for Rural Kids,
which promotes education and
fights hunger in the developing
world.
Faraon said students who
would like to help the victims
of Typhoon Haiyan should
research and donate to different
charities that are directly help-
ing victims in the Philippines.

models
DETROIT (AP) - Cars that
run on hydrogen and exhaust
only water vapor are emerging
to challenge electric vehicles
as the world's transportation of
the future.
At auto shows on two conti-
nents Wednesday, three auto-
makers unveiled hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles to be delivered to
the general public as early as
next spring.
Hyundai Motor Co. will be
the first to the mass market in
the U.S. It unveiled a hydrogen-
powered Tucson small SUV
at the Los Angeles Auto Show
that will be leased to consum-
ers. Honda also revealed plans in
Los Angeles for a car due out in
201S. Earlier, at the Tokyo Motor
Show, Toyota promised a mass-
produced fuel cell car by 2015 in
Japan and 2016 in the U.S.
Hydrogen cars are appealing
because unlike electric vehi-
cles, they have the range of a
typical gasoline car and can be
refueled quickly. Experts say
the industry also has overcome
safety and reliability concerns
that have hindered distribution
in the past.
But hydrogen cars still have
a glaring downside - refueling
stations are scarce, and costly
to build.
Consumers can expect costs
in line with some luxury mod-
els. In Tokyo, Toyota promised
a price of $50,000 to $100,000,
and as close to the lower figure
as possible. That's comparable
to its Lexus luxury sedans, but
a range that makes the once
space-age experiment with fuel
cells more credible.
Hyundai said it will lease the
Tucsons for $499 per month for
three years with $3,000 down.
And Hyundai is offering to pay
the hydrogen and maintenance

References to freedom, equal-
ity, fairness and Lincoln - the
desk was where he penned his
1861 inaugural address - were
peppered throughout the event.
In attendance were top elected
officials, including Illinois Attor-
ney General Lisa Madigan and
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Organizers estimated roughly
2,300 attended, including activ-
ists and members of the public.
Illinois, where Democrats lead
both legislative chambers and the
governor's office, legalized civil
unions in 2011, but the road to
same-sex marriage was bumpy.
When 2013 began advocates
hoped Illinois would've been the
10th state, but watched as other
states passed it. Gay marriage is
allowed in Washington D.C., and
15 other states; Hawaii's governor
signed a measure last week.
Even with support from top
business leaders, unions and
some Republicans, several law-
makers were resistant to the idea.
That included some Democrats
in more conservative downstate
Illinois and some Chicago-area
lawmakers.

The measure was fought
hard by some of the state's most
well-recognized religious fig-
ures, including Cardinal Francis
George of theArchdiocese of Chi-
cago and the Rev. James Meeks,
a former state senator who runs
a politically-influential mega
church in Chicago. Meeks was
part of a coalition of black pastors
who said marriage should remain
between a man and woman and
sponsored robocalls in several
legislative districts and on the
airwaves. The opposition placed
black lawmakers in the House
in a spotlight and several evaded
public inquiries on the matter for
months.
Although Illinois once
appeared poised to become the
first Midwestern state to approve
gay marriage in the Legislature,
Minnesota did it sooner and
started holding its first same-sex
weddings over the summer. Iowa
allows gay marriages too because
of a court ruling, not a legislative
vote.
The Illinois Senate approved
the measure on Valentine's Day,
but the bill's main sponsor, Dem-

ocratic state Rep. Greg Harris of
Chicago decided against calling
it for a vote in the House because
he said he didn't have the needed
support. In a tearful speech in
front of his colleagues, he vowed
to bring the measure back.
Proponents then launched
another aggressive campaign
with help from labor, the former
head of the Illinois Republican
Party and the ACLU. They billed
the measure as a matter of civil
rights and equality for fami-
lies. Quinn and House Speaker
Michael Madigan also persuade
lawmakers in the final days.
The measure passed the Illi-
nois House earlier this month by
a narrow margin 61-54; It needed
60 votes to pass. But none of the
opposition or slim margin was
evident Wednesday at the event
where the Chicago Gay Men's
Chorus performed and Lincoln's
desk was lined with patriot bun-
ting.
"We're here to celebrate, fam-
ily, commitment, equality, love,
courage and community," Har-
ris told the crowd to enthusiastic
applause.

costs. The company will start
leasing in the Los Angeles area,
where most of the state's nine
fueling stations are located.
California lawmakers have
allocated $100 million to build
100 more. Honda wouldn't
reveal any pricing details.
Evenas battery-powered and
hybrid-electric cars took on
conventional gasoline models
in the past decade, automakers
continued research into hydro-
gen fuel cells, said Paul Mutolo,
director of external partner-
ships for the Cornell Univer-
sity Energy Materials Center.
Manufacturers now are limited
only by costs and the lack of
fillingstations, he said.
Hydrogen cars, Mutolo
said, have an advantage over
battery-powered electric cars
because drivers don't have to
worry about running out of
electricity and having to wait
hours for recharging. "It's very
similar to the kind of behav-
ior that drivers have come to
expect from their gasoline
cars," he said.
Hydrogen fuel cells use a
complex chemical process to
separate electrons and protons
in hydrogengas molecules. The
electrons move toward a posi-
tive pole, and the movement
creates electricity. That powers
a car's electric motor, which
turns the wheels.
Since the hydrogen isn't
burned, there's no pollution.
Instead, oxygen also is pumped
into the system, and when it
meets the hydrogen ions and
electrons, that creates water
and heat. The only byproduct is
water. A fuel cell produces only
about one volt of electricity, so
many are stacked to generate
enough juice.
Hydrogen costs as little as $3
for an amount needed to power
a car the same distance as a gal-
lon of gasoline, Mutolo said.
Manufacturers likely will
lose money on hydrogen cars at
first, but costs will decrease as
precious metals are reduced in
the fuel cells, Mutolo said.

DNA evidence links
single suspect to
Monday's attack
PARIS (AP) - After a two-day
nationwide manhunt, French
police arrested a man Wednes-
day night suspected of shooting
a newspaper assistant photogra-
pher and three other attacks.
The motive for the attacks
remains unclear.
Interior Minister Manuel
Valls identified the suspect as
Abdelhakim Dekhar, convicted
in 1998 as an accomplice in a
high-profile 1994 robbery and
car chase that left three police
officers and a taxi driver dead.
Dekhar served four years in
prison in the so-called Rey-
Maupin affair but authorities
had no trace of him in recent
years, Valls said.
Based on DNA data, authori-
ties believe he was the lone
gunman behind Monday's
shooting at the prominent
daily newspaper Liberation,
a shooting outside French
bank Societe Generale, a brief
hostage-taking in which the
suspect hijacked a car, and a
similar shooting incident three
days before at news network
BFM-TV.
The shooting prompted cries
of concern about attacks on the
media. Security was tightened
at media offices and on the busy
Champs-Elysees shopping ave-
nue.
Dekhar apparently tried
to kill himself before he was
arrested Wednesday, Valls told
reporters early Thursday.
Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a
spokeswoman for the French
prosecutor's office, said the
suspect was arrested in an
underground parking lot in
Bois-Colombes, 10 kilometers

(6 miles) north of Paris. She and
police union official Christophe
Crepin said the man appeared
heavily medicated when he was
detained.
"My colleagues noticed
he was not very lucid. They
deduced that he had taken
medicines, because of the cap-
sules nearby. They called the
ambulance, which brought
him to the hospital. There he
is incarcerated but in a medical
environment," Crepin told The
Associated Press.
Dekhar was found after a
witness reported to police that
a suspect resembling images
broadcast on national televi-
sion since Monday had stayed
at his house in recent days,
said Paris judicial police chief
Christian Flaesch.
Authorities had released
video footage and photos of
the shooter, who was wielding
a pump-action shotgun in the
attacks on Liberation and BFM.
The gunman entered the
lobby of Liberation around
10 a.m. Monday and opened
fire. A 23-year-old photogra-
pher, who works at the paper
as a freelance assistant, was in
intensive care after being shot
near the heart and in the arm.
Valls said he visited the pho-
tographer Wednesday and he's
"doing better."
Soon after the shooting at
Liberation, three shots were
fired in front of the head-
quarters of the bank Societe
Generale in the Paris suburb of I
La Defense. No one was hurt.
Less than an hour later, a
man called police to say he had
been taken hostage by a gun-
man in the town of Puteaux,
next door to La Defense. Police
said the gunman forced his
hostage to drive six kilometers
(3 1/2 miles) back toward cen-
tral Paris, then let him go on
the Champs-Elysees.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Before the start of the season,
Michigan women's basketball
coach Kim Barnes Arico said
size was going to be her squad's
biggest concern.
So you can imagine the night-
mare when Pittsburgh's (2-2
overall) 6-foot-11 redshirt fresh-
man center, Marvadene "Bub-
bles" Anderson, came to town.
Anderson holds the title for the
world's tallest teenager.
The Jamaica native usu-
ally starts for the Panthers, but
against Michigan (4-2), she came
off the bench, which allowed
the Wolverines to jump out to a
fast 4-0 start from a pair of bas-
kets from junior forward Cyesha
Goree.
In response, Pittsburgh
turned to its secret weapon,
and everyone noticed the min-
ute Anderson checked into the
game. Anderson is over a foot
taller than the Wolverines' start-
ing backcourt and stands seven
inches above Michigan's tall-
est player, 6-foot-4 senior Val
Driscoll. Her presence, though,
didn't faze the Wolverines, who
went on to beat Pittsburgh,
83-75, for their third straight
win.
When Anderson first checked
in, it took Michigan a few min-
utes to get acclimated to match-
ing up against such a big player.
Fifteen seconds after Anderson
entered the game, she had an
easy layup for the Panthers' first
points of the night. But despite
the unbalanced matchup in the
paint, the Wolverines were even-
tually able to find some offense
down low, even when Anderson
was on the court.
"I just had to get out and run
more, run and get out in transi-
tion and try to get my points,"
said junior forward Cyesha
Goree. "(On defense) I looked
to take away her strength, my
guards helping to dig in so she
felt doubled, forcing her to kick
it back out."
Anderson's other-worldly size
has plagued her with knee trou-
bles, and it shows when she's on
the court.
In transition, she is usually
strides behind her teammates
and requires more bench time
than others. Michigan used the
delay to attack the paint early in

the possession. But once Ander-
son got back on defense, the
Wolverines typically stuck with
working the perimeter.
"I thought we did a tremen-
dous job tonight of making
Bubbles try to come out on ball
screens," Barnes Arico said. "She
wasn't really leaving the paint,
so we took advantage with our
outside shot."
Anderson found herself on the
bench late in the first half, but
two quick baskets from Goree,
followed by foul trouble for Pan-
ther forward Asia Logan, forced
Pittsburgh coach Suzie McCo-
nnell-Serio to turn to her red-
shirt freshman earlier than she
wanted.
"I don't know many women
that are 6-foot-11," Barnes Arico
said. "And any time she got deep
in the paint, we knew we were
going to be in trouble, but I
thought Val Driscoll did an out-
standing job on her in the first
half."
To start the second half for
Michigan, freshman guard Siera
Thompson drained a 3-pointer
from the right side. A quick Pan-
ther turnover immediately after
gave the ball to Goree who hit an
uncontested bank shot from the
paint. McConnell-Serio turned
to her bench once again, as Goree
made the basket and motioned
for Anderson to check into the
game. On Anderson's first pos-
session, she drew a quick foul
from Goree and hit an easy shot
over her after the inbounds pass.

Anderson's presence for Pitts-
burgh is undeniable and her
ceiling is extremely high, but
her early production on the stat
sheet has been limited because
of her shorter minutes. She fin-
ished Wednesday's loss with 12
points and five rebounds, just
around averages nine-points and
four-and-a-half-rebounds.
"It was a challenge and you
look at her and you're like 'wow
she's tall,' " said junior guard
Nicole Elmblad. "She was able
to finish a lot on us and a couple
times she did stuff on us that we
didn't like, but for the most part I
thought we did a pretty good job
of boxing her out on the offen-
sive end."
Added Barnes Arico: "We
tried to limit her touches, and we
tried to double her as best as we
could. Overall, I thought we did a
very decent job on her. We made
her turn the ball over a little bit,
and we got her into foul trouble,
which I thought helped us as
well."
In the end, the Wolverines'
starting frontcourt, Goree and
Elmblad, won the battle, gener-
ating just enough offensive and
defensive power down low to
win the game. The two finished
with 10 and 19 points, respec-
tively. Elmblad matched her
career high in points and also
added six rebounds.
A third-straight win was big
for Michigan, but playing against
the world's tallest teenager will
be memorable for years to come.

Freshman guard Siera Thompson scored a career-high 22 points in Wednesday's 83-75 win over Pittsburgh.

A look back on Rachael Mack's career

By MATTHEWKIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
In the first chapter of senior
forward Rachael Mack's Michi-
gan legacy, she stood on Phyl-
lis Ocker Field for the first home
game of her Michigan field hockey
career. It was Sept., 10, 2010. Mack
looked up at the scoreboard to
see the Wolverines staring at a
3-0 deficit against No. 14 James
' Madison. Unintimidated by this
disadvantage, Mack scored her
first two goals to lead Michigan
to a 4-3 victory. Only one month
into her career, she was a star, and
this was one of the first indicators
of the successful career that lay
ahead for Mack.
She was born on Jan.24,1992 to
Derek and Fiona Mack in Broms-
grove, England. Mack grew up
with a passion for sports but didn't
play field hockey until the age of11
- early compared to most Ameri-
cans, but late in England.
"I played tennis when I was
younger, and I always wanted to
play a sport," Mack said. "Any kind
of ball I wanted to play, and I never
played hockey before I went to the
(Bromsgrove) school. I started at
school when I actually didn't want
to play it, as I wanted to play foot-
ball, soccer, instead but then I got
into hockey and from minute one I
really loved the game."
Once Mack picked up the stick,
she didn't look back. Mack played
for Olton high school and a club
team in England's Women's Pre-
mier Division, among others, prior
to coming to Michigan.
When Mack started to serious-
* ly consider her choices, she knew
that she would somehow end up
in the United States. Mack had
dreamt of coming to the United
States at a young age. When her

father took a job working for an
American company, a nine-year
old Mack was afforded the oppor-
tunity to live in Texas for a sum-
mer, which just enhanced that
dream.
"It was right at that age where
everything in America was amaz-
ing and big so that was really fun,"
Mack said. "I always wanted to
come to America, whether it was
for hockey or for tennis. It was
something I wanted to do."
Mack's coach of three years at
Olton, Michael Boal, gave the tip
to an old coaching friend, Michi-
gan assistant coach Ryan Lang-
ford, that Mack decided she was
going to leave England for college.
"First impression was kind of
a 'wow factor'," Langford said. "I
saw this girl playing for England's
under-18 national team, and when
I saw her step on the field I thought
she held such a great presence,
and it looked like she had an aura
around her of strength and confi-
dence and that translated directly
into play. She was very talented
from the first day I saw her."
Langford knew from that point
on that he needed to recruit Mack,
and invited the family to visit.
Like many students who tour Ann
Arbor, Mack fell in love.
"We were driving up State
Street, and my mum was look-
ing around and she was just like
'Yeah, I think you should go here,
Rachael,' " Mack said. "Every
new thing I saw, every step along
the way of my visit made it more
prominent in my mind that Michi-
gan was where I wanted to be."
While Michigan was on a
road trip to Louisville, Langford
received a call from the future
phenom - Mack was coming to
Ann Arbor.
Unlike most international play-

ers playing field hockey in Amer-
ica, Mack knew she was going to
stay for four years. Some athletes
may only stay for a year or two
to work on their game and head
home to play professionally.
"I wanted to get a great educa-
tion, and Michigan offered that, so
I did come thinking that I would
stay here four years in my mind,"
Mack said. "After my first year,
I knew I was going to stay here
because it's awesome."
Not only was there the added
pressure of being a freshman play-
ing James Madison in front of the
home crowd, but the coach stand-
ing on the other side of the field
was none other than the reason
Mack wound up at Michigan -
Boal.
"I scored my first two goals,
and funny enough the two goals
I scored were the ones me and
Michael had worked on before I
came here," Mack said. "It was
kind of cyclical that it would come
back to that. It was really nice to
have him there and be able to see
my first goals even though he was
the opposing coach. I told him,
'I am sorry, but I am not really
sorry."'
Mack finished her freshman
year with 16 goals and 36 points,
and led the Wolverines to the
Big Ten title. She won the Big
Ten Tournament MVP award,
NFCHA All-American third-team
honors, All-Big Ten second team,
Michigan Rookie of the Year and
the Michigan athletic academic
achievement award.
"I scored a lot of goals my fresh-
man year, and my dad was like
'You should look up the record, go
see it,' so I did," Mack said. "He
was the one that initially set my
mind that you are going to break
that record by the end of senior

year."
And so Mack continued to
score en route to the Michigan
goals record. She led the team in
scoring every year after her fresh-
man year. Mack continued to win
awards each season while getting
closer to achieving her objective.
It was only fitting it would
finally be broken against archrival
Ohio State in overtime.
Redshirt junior Lauren Hauge
fed Mack the ball just outside the
circle, and she carried it, spun
around a defender and fired a shot
to the top-right side of the net to
make her mark as Michigan's all-
time leadingscorer.
As an added bonus, Mack was
awarded Big Ten Player of the
Year and was a unanimous choice
for Big Ten Offensive Player of the
Year.
In the field hockey team's final
banquet, the player who held the
record before Mack, April Fanzo-
ni, was in Ann Arbor and present-
ed Mack her own record-breaking
ball she scored against the Buck-
eyes.
Fanzoni and Mack had been
talking prior to the goal, and Fan-
zoni was there cheering Mack on.
"It was funny, she had scored
68 goals and I have 73 now, and
she said, 'You know I am glad that
you have overran my record by
five, because if it was just one then
it would have been painful," Mack
said. "But now you have done it by
a few more so I'm okay with that.'
Now that Mack's career as a
Wolverine is over, she looks for-
ward to the senior game, as it
will be her last opportunity to
represent Michigan. Once she
graduates, Mack hopes to join
the British national team. Hav-
ing played for the junior national

team before college and improv-
ing her game in the states, Mack
is on the right track to achieve her
goal.
And so in the final chapter of
Mack's Michigan legacy, on Nov.
3, 2013, Mack stood on Phyl-
lis Ocker Field for the last home

game of her Michigan career. The
Wolverines were staring down a
3-1 deficit, just like her first home
game. Mack scored the final two
goals of her career, leading Michi-
gan to a 4-3 victory and finished as
the Michigan field hockey team's
all-time leadingscorer.

Lewan not a semifinalist

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Taylor Lewan came back for
a Big Ten championship. With
that out of reach, at least he
could have been
rewarded for NOTEBOOK
sticking around
in Ann Arbor with some individ-
ual awards.
But on Wednesday, the fifth-
year senior tackle was not named
a semifinalist for the Outland
Trophy, given to the best inte-
rior lineman in college football.
There were six players named
to the list, and the player who
was projected as a first-round
draft pick last year was not one
of them.
Unsurprisingly, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke was less than
pleased.
"Am I disappointed?" he said.
"Yeah. Really disappointed."
Lewan is part of an offensive
line that has been beaten up all
year. It's Michigan's offensive
crux, and it makes sense that the
best player on the line has taken
some criticism.
Still, it's not like Lewan has
had a disappointing year. It's
hard to gauge an offensive line-
man's play on an individual basis
since it works as more of a unit
than any other group in football,
but Lewan has seemingly held
his own.
When asked if Lewan
should've been named as a semi-
finalist, Hoke said, "Yeah. No
doubt. No doubt,"
In terms of draft stock, Lewan
should still be a first-round pick,
at least according to ESPN draft
analyst Mel Kiper.
Last week, Kiper projected
Lewan as a mid-first round pick
and has him ranked No. 14 on his
Big Board. That position would
be further down than last year's
projections, where many ana-
lysts had Lewan going as a top-
10 pick.
But even if the Outland Tro-
phy committee doesn't see it, nor

SWITCHING HAYES: In a run-
ning performance that complete-
ly switched the tables, redshirt
sophomore running back Justice
Hayes was the odd man out.
With starting running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint out with
a concussion, Derrick Green
and De'Veon Smith picked up
the slack for a running game in
desperate need of a jolt against
Northwestern last weekend. The
two freshmen combined for 120
yards on 27 carries, good for 4.4

yards per carry. In its last two
games, Michigan had rushed for
negative rushing yards.
The unsung hero, according
to Hoke, was Hayes. He didn't
have a carry (he has only one on
the year) but did have a recep-
tion on a screen pass that Hoke
said should have gone for a lot
more yards if properly executed.
Hayes was also praised for his
blitz pickups, which are huge
from a young running back work-
ing with a raw offensive line.
On Wednesday, Hoke said that
Hayes could be transiting from
running back to a wide receiver
role, saying, "That's where we'd
like to get him trained most of
the time."
He added: "Justice has been
in the program long enough and
he knows the protections, even
though we moved him out to the
Z receiver, slot a bit. Because of

his maturity and being around,
he can do both."
WELLMANIZED?: If you think
Green looks like a powerful run-
ning back now, wait until he has
a full offseason to work in Ann
Arbor.
His freshman year started
with weight issues and an injury
in fall camp, but now, Green is
down (yes, down) to 230 pounds.
He's always been a big, bruising
back, but Hoke still thinks Green
has a ways to go before he reach-
es his optimal weight.
The coaching staff, specifi-
cally strength and conditioning
coach Aaron Wellman, will have
a lot to do with that.
"He won't be in his prime
shape yet," Hoke said. "He has
to be Wellmanized and all those
things. Summer, winter, spring
football. Those guys haven't tast-
ed it all yet."

Instead of vacation, summer of labor
propels Stauskas and LeVert to next level

in the offense
this year.
The pair spent the spring and
summer semesters in town tak-
ing classes, gunning against each
other in jump-shot drills and put-
ting in work with strength and
conditioning coach Jon Sander-
son.
They were joined by upper-
classmen Jon Horford and Jordan
Morgan for the spring semester,
but in the summer term, Stauskas
and LeVert had the practice facil-
ity to themselves.
While manyoftheirclassmates
were sleeping in during lazy sum-
mer mornings, the sophomores
got up for 9 a.m. class, got a quick
bite to eat and then spent eight
hours at Crisler Center and the
Player Development Center.
After arriving from Central
Campus, they'd put in two-and-a-
half hours of weight liftingbefore
getting something else to eat and
heading to an open gym.
The work in the weight room
bulked LeVert up from 170
pounds as a freshman to 185 this

said.
Added LeVert: "We were pret-
ty close, but we got a lot closer
since then. Every day was a bond-
ing moment, just a lot of fun.
Being with him every second of
the day from start to finish, it was
just great."
Summer ended, so with the
arrival of fall came the arrival of
the rest of the team.
In addition to sophomore for-
wards Mitch McGary and Glenn
Robinson III beingthe focal point
of the Michigan attack, LeVert
and Stauskas were clear in their
intent - they were ready to lead
the team as well.
LeVert was so impressive in
the fall that Michigan coach John
Beilein scrapped his plans to
start two big men, wanting to get
LeVert into the starting lineup.
LeVert made sure the fans under-
stood why Beilein made the move.
He led the team with 17 and 24
points, respectively, in the first
two games.
Stauskas, meanwhile, has
made himself a more dominant
presence on the court. The added
weight didn't take away his dead-
eye 3-point stroke, and it has
made him even more dangerous
when dribbling to the hoop and
finishing at the rim. He is shoot-
ing 53 percent from behind the
arc and was the most threaten-
ing Wolverine on the floor against
the Cyclones with ateam-high 20
points.
He leads the team with 17.3
points per game, just ahead of
LeVert, who has 15.3. Robinson
has been slow out of the gate after
an explosive performance in the
exhibition opener, while McGary
is just returning to action after a
back injury.
Summer has passed, and
instead of NBA Playoffs viewings, C
LeVert and Stauskas can instead
watch early season NBA action.
They can watch Burke and Hard-
away on TV, as it becomes more
and more likely thatthey will join
those two in the next few years.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Sophomore guards Carls LeVert and Nik Stauskas spent their summers in Ann Arbor together to get stronger. The two lead the team in scoring so far this year.

year - weight that can support a
more aggressive driving game as
he assumes a role based less on
hanging out near the perimeter
and more on slashing into the
paint to draw attention from the
defense.
Stauskas was able to add 16
pounds over the offseason, all
muscle, he says. The strength has

been palpable the first few games,
flying through the defense on
multiple occasions without being
knocked off his path. In the sec-
ond half of a loss against Iowa
State on Sunday, Stauskas drove
through the left side of the paint
to fire home a right-handed dunk.
The added weight will also serve
to make him a more imposing

presence defensively.
"It was a tough process from
coach Sanderson," LeVert said.
"He pushed us every day in the
weight room starting from the
time we lost to Louisville up until
now, he's still pushing us. I just
got stronger every day."
The period from noon to 8p.m.
wasn't all spent on the court or

in the weight room. Sometimes
they'd be watching television or
playing video games on the big
screen in the PDC video room.
When the day was done, they'd
head back to the apartment to
watch NBA playoff games.
"When you're here all day, just
me and him, there's a lot of time
to just talk about stuff," Stauskas

how you use it. Alcohol is a drug,

anything else. It certainly was for

I wishI could tell you that

stayed sober, but obviously the
math wouldn't add up. It is a very
confusing and terrifying thing to
be told - when you're not even
legally old enough to consume
alcohol yet - that you have to quit
drinking forever, and I wasn't
ready. So, I went looking for more
proof.
It took two more years of

I could never adequately describe
it in words, another withdrawal
from the University, a four-month
stay at a treatmentcenter in Ari-
zona and a second DUI to get me
to do whatI now knowI should've
been doing since age 15: taking
responsibility for my disease.
There are two thingsI really
want to stress with this personal
divulgence. The first: Alcoholism
and drug addiction don't discrimi-
nate. They don't target a specific
sex, race, gender, social status...
or age. Today in recovery, I'm sur-
rounded by dozens of other people
- both young and not so young
- with whom, on a daily basis,
I battle this chronic and, if left
untreated, fatal disease.
And the second: There is hope.
Since hittingbottom on Nov. 3,
2010 and accepting the help I'd
been offered, I've lived a life, drug
and alcohol-free, ofwhich I used
to only dream. I'm pursuing my
passions asa professional singer-
songwriter and aspiring film-
maker (Let's just say, Ihave plenty
of material to work with). My edu-
cation is no longer a burden; it's
a gift. And my right to drive is no
longer just a right; it's a privilege.
Do I have hard days? Of course
I do. I'm in my 20s, andI don't
drink. I live ona college campus
where waking up on the floor in
your own vomit happens all the
time ... just not to the same person
over and over again. I'm sur-
rounded by thousands of people
every day who can have a beer...
withouthaving to worry about
windingup in jail later that night.
But I have a disease called alcohol-
ism, and this is how I have to live
if I want to live. IfI can't change
my circumstances, Imust change
myself.
And though gettingaand staying
sober in your early/mid-twenties
isn't easy, this seemingly insur-
mountable challenge is what
makes the positives in my life all
that more enjoyable. Tom Hanks
probably put it best in "A League
of Their Own" when he said: "If it
wasn't hard, everyone would do it.
The hard is what makes it great."
If you or someone you know
is struggling with alcoholism or
drug addiction, don't lose hope.
It may seem like an impossible
demon to conquer, but there's help
to be gotten, and no matter how
much it seems like it, no one is
ever alone.
Keyes is not alone.

Daily Arts Writers Akshay
Seth and Jamie Bircoll step
into the salon for a friendly
debate on
Natalie Portman.
Akshay: Whenever I get
into extended debates with my
friends about the Greatests Of
All Time in Hollywood, the big-
gest point of contention usually
ends up being Natalie Portman.
No, she'll probably never join
the likes of Meryl Streep, but is
it really fair to call her a medi-
ocre actress? This underpaid
college newspaper editor says
no. We're talking about the per-
son who, at 12-years-old, in her
first-ever acting gig, managed
to steal the spotlight from the
likes of Jean Reno. Every one
of her performances, even if the
scripts aren't always brilliant,
manages to reflect a deeply
personal side of her identity
that isn't just weighed down by
melodrama. She's a creature of
nuance, and each of her films
is a glowing testament to that
reality.
Jamie: Except for "Star
Wars," of course. And "Your
Highness." And "Mr. Mago-
rium's Wonder Emporium." Is
that enough or should I name a
few more? I admit, she has her
moments. But every actor has
"moments," those one or two
movies where the actor can
really shine. But that is not the
norm for Natalie Portman. She
is consistently less than stellar
and rarely lives up to the hype
that always surrounds her.
Akshay: OK, I'll give you
"Your Highness." But let's be
honest, who, in their right
minds, would've said no when
George Fucking Lucas called
you up while you were in college
and asked if you warnted to star
in a "Star Wars" reboot. Even
some of the silly stuff like "Your
Highness" represents her ver-
satility as an actor. They're not
great films, but they give her a
chance to extend her range in
the industry and are a repre-
sentation of how she refuses
to be pigeonholed into playing
the weepy, sentimental type. I
agree that she needs to be more
careful about the scripts she
picks, butI think those debacles
are more a result of bad deci-
sion-making than acting.

*I

"Do you know I'm wearing a wig?"
Jamie: Don't get me wrong,
I'm the last person to say that
Natalie Portman ruined the
great writing of George Lucas.
But you cannot deny that she
severely underacted those mov-
ies; her "you're breaking my
heart" delivery haunts me to
this day. And face it, her best
movies are the ones where she's
weepy and sentimental. I don't
care if you're being versatile by
being in a bad movie - you're
still doing a bad movie. In
everything she does, she's usu-
ally crying her eyes out or long-
ing for better things. But as a
side note, "Garden State" is one
of the best movies of the 2000s.
Akshay: A lot of people knock
her for being a two-note actor:
Either she's crying or she's
extremely upset about some
perceived wrong. I have a one-
word response to those critics:
"Closer." The film showcases
her ability to be emotionless,
temperamental and capricious
convincingly. In that movie, she
teeters the line between col-
lapsing into the depths of her
own sadness and being able
to move on from a long-lost
romance. She's never quite sad,
but she's also never quite con-

vinced she's happy. The film is
a perfect representation of how
not to overact, and also a tragic
testament to undeserved Oscar
snubs. Foor everyone that's
convinced Poretman can only
scream or weep in movies, I'm
sure you haven't had a chance to
properly examine her last scene
with Jude Law in "Closer."
Jamie: I admitI haven't seen
"Closer," and I'm always willing
to give a decent actor another
shot, so I'll check it out. But
the fact is, up until right now, I
have never heard someone say
"Natalie Portman is the best
part of the movie." Her Oscar
win for "Black Swan" is com-
pletely undeserved - she won
for being committed to prepa-
ration, and if that's all it takes
to win an Oscar then Christian
Bale should've won for "The
Machinist" (by no means a
good movie, but the dude lost 63
pounds). All I'm saying is, she's
frequently outperformed by
the other actors and, with the
exception of one film, is always
crying like the girl in "Jurassic
Park." She's got time to improve
on her work, but until then, I'm
skeptical she'll rise in the ranks
of great actors.

of the central character and the

Having seen the three-

know all there is to know about

he lives life before he is told of
his predicament, how he han-

relationship with his business
partner, his romantic feelings
for his doctor, how he cares for
every patient strapped downby
the rules of the FDA and how

he refuses to cooperate with the

know how his saga ends, but
considering that trailers aren't
supposed to give away the end-

grace.
Trailers mustbe judged not
on what they show, but how they
show it. Sometimes, even the

case of this trailer, it's the exact

Revival of Deleuze

Jay Z stands for
fa iaj

New philosophy
group to bring
speakers to campus
By CARLINA DUAN
Daily Arts Writer
"The shame of being a man
- is there any better reason to
" write?" These were the words of
Gilles Deleuze, a renowned phi-
losopher and writer whose ideas
and theories have influenced
multiple disciplines across centu-
ries, including music, literature,
film, architecture and fine art.
Deleuze's work, spanning from
the 1960s until his death in 1995, is
often taught in University classes.
The Rackham Interdisci-
plinary Workshop - titled the
Deleuze Interest Group - has
created a forum space and "Mate-
rial Encounters" lecture series,
centered around untangling
Deleuzian principles and extend-
ing academic conversation. The
Deleuze Interest Group will bring
several guest speakers onto cam-
pus throughout the year, as a way
to invite the campus and broader
community to think critically
about Deleuzian philosophy.
"(His ideas) are fresh," said
American Culture Ph.D. student
and Deleuze Interest Group co-
coordinator Stephen Molldrem.
"They're new readings of works
that a lot of people are familiar
with."
Deleuze and French philoso-
pher Felix Guattari often part-
nered together to create a new
landscape in the field.
"What they tried to do was
make a radical break from some
of the defining features in phi-
losophy," Molldrem said. "They're
(inviting) you to think with them.
That's actually quite joyful and
does a lot for you if you're working

with them."
The Deleuze Interest Group,
sponsored by the Rackham
Graduate School Interdisciplin-
ary Workshop program, began in
winter 2012, after several students
had taken an English literary the-
ory seminar during the fall. After
several discussions in and outside
of class, students came together
and proposed the idea of a work-
shop centered around Deleuze.
LSA junior and co-coordinator of
the Deleuze Interest Group Nate
Gallant noted that the class was
an effective gateway course to
further dissecting philosophy and
theory.
"That class was a really great
place where a lot of people who
were interested in continental
philosophy and literature could
come together," Gallant said.
"There aren't a terrible amount of
classes that could offer a (focus)
on just one theorist or philoso-
pher."
After the class ended, the con-
versation continued in Deleuze
Interest Group meetings, which
served as forum spaces where the
group would discuss readings.
This year, the Deleuze Interest
Group established a speaker series
to introduce Deleuze's philoso-
phy, as well as the multi-dimen-
sional feature of Deleuzian work
in other fields.
University of Wisconsin-Mad-
ison Geography Prof. Dr. Keith
Woodward gave a Deleuze Inter-
est Group talk on Nov. 1, titled,
"Affect, State Theory, and the
Politics of Confusion." Woodward
applies Deleuzian concepts in his
study of political consequence and
socialtheory, andcentered his talk
around an example of the 2004
Republican National Convention
in New York. Regarding occu-
pations and social movements,
Woodward noted the applicability
of Deleuzian thought.

"He subvertsthe 'normal' read-
ing of the history of philosophy,
and he also subverts the canon in
philosophy," Woodward said. "So
his project in part was to read the
minor thinkers rather than the
major thinkers."
This interdisciplinary phi-
losophy has generated further
conversation among scholars and
students alike.
"You can have Deleuze be
reframed through this other sub-
ject matter too," said co-coordina-
tor and LSA senior Taylor Portela,
"There's that possibility to have
multiple viewpoints be in flux
with each other."
However, the group empha-
sized that the Deleuze Interest
Group does not center on Deleuze
himself, but rather the discussions
that derive from Deleuzian ideas.
"It's the conversation that we
can have because of Deleuze, not
necessarily Deleuze's work itself,"
Gallant said. "He offers up the
philosophical space for interdis-
ciplinary conversations that we're
hoping to have in these forums."
Furthermore, group members,
who come from a diverse back-
ground of different fields, years
and majors across the Univer-
sity, stress that their studies on
Deleuze allow them to both fur-
ther enhance their own projects
in their individual areas of study,
as well as find common ground to
engage in philosophical conversa-
tions with one another.
"This is such a great opportuni-
ty that Rackham and the Univer-
sity of Michigan give us, so even
just to have the chance to bring
in these speakers and to part-
ner with other departments - it
just really speaks so highly of the
amazing community that we have
here at the University," Molldrem
said. "It's about what (Deleuze)
lets all of us come together and
do."

Jay Z passes with flying colors.
It's no secret that the super-
glamorous Barneys New York
recently came under fire for racial
profiling. Two separate Black cus-
tomers filed complaints against
the store when police questioned
them after making lavish pur-
chases. One individual was even
accused of credit card fraud.
This wouldn't be the first time
that a top-line store was accused
of such actions - surprise, sur-
prise. Just last month, actor
Rob Brown also claimed police
detained him for possible "credit
card fraud" after shopping at
Macy's.
But this time, the racist charges
affected more than just the store
in question. Because this time, the
accusations were filed just before
Jay Z intended to bring his exclu-
sive BNY SCC clothing collection
to Barneys. Oops!
Of course, the mobs took to
Twitter, demanding that Jay Z cut
ties with Barneys. But after a lot

around a friendship affected

TERESA MArHEW/Daily
"RENT" is attracting a diverse range of student performers, from the Residential College to the School of Engineering. The production looks to examine darker topics geared around an honest discussion of HIV/AIDS.

MUSKET provides aspiring performers a medium for their art before entering professional productions.

The production is often identified as the musical for our generation.

MUSKET
From Page lB
In an unassuming rehears-
al space in the hinterlands of
South Campus, distressed gar-
bage cans stand at the ready
in one corner and backpacks
are strewn across another. In
the center, 16 students wait to
transform into AIDS-afflicted,
poverty-ridden, fatally idealis-
tic New Yorkers.
Before the acclaimed musical
starts, each actor takes hold of a
piece of scaffolding, pushingthe
set into place until a bare loft
centered around a dingy couch
comes alive. They begin to sing,
and as the music swells, their
Wolverine garb and fresh faces
fade away.
When School of Music,
Theatre & Dance senior Ryan
Vasquez, playing lost musician
Roger Davis, puts down his gui-
tar to back away from Mimi's
seductions, you can barely see a
tattoo of the Block 'M' peeking
from behind his shirt. This is
the heart of the University, just
in a context not always associ-
ated with it.
This is "RENT" as imagined
by MUSKET, the student-run
musical theater organization on

campus. MUSKET is made up
entirely of students, and is cur-
rently run by producers Ryan
Lucas and Hannah Rosenthal,
both performing arts manage-
ment seniors in MT&D. The pro-
gram puts on one musical each
semester that premieres to an
audience of around 1,300 people
in the Power Center for the Per-
forming Arts.
"MUSKET is this amazing
opportunity and this amazing
pool of resources," Lucas said.
"We get to use it to experiment,
create, make mistakes, grow as
leaders and create material that
is so fun and accessible for the
University."
As the producers and only
members of MUSKET that don't
rotate from show to show, Lucas
and Rosenthal were tasked with
electing which musicals to per-
form this year.
"We look for something that
we think that people are not
only going to be excited to be
in but that the campus will be
excited to see," Rosenthal said.
"RENT" is often identified
as the ultimate musical for our
generation - for so many per-
formers it's the reason they fell
in love with musical theater.
Lucas and Rosenthal both have
felt connected to the show since
childhood, and say everyone,

regardless of background, can
relate.
More than just a show
MT&D junior Sam Yabrow
first heard "RENT" in middle
school, riding in the backseat
of his mother's car. He would
only sing along to character
Mark Cohen's lines, and now he
is reprising the role of warm-
hearted and neurotic Mark,
albeit in a grander format.
Rosenthal was an unusually
short eighth grader when her
dad took her to see the movie
in theaters; the patrons around
them were shocked to see this
diminutive little girl watching
that "show about AIDS." She
says she understands the themes
so much better now - and
understands why others were so
disapproving.
"RENT" 's often stigmatized
as "that one play about HIV/
AIDS" - a practice in extremes
and impossibilities rather than
vivid humanity.
"When you saw the musi-
cal for the first time you were
like 'Oh, it's about AIDS, every-
one dies of AIDS,' but there is
so much more to it than that,"
Lucas said.
Written by Jonathon Larson
in the late 1980s and early '90s,
"RENT" chronicles a group of
artists and activists surviv-
ing in New York's East Village.
While many are infected with
HIV, the virus isn't the preemi-
nent theme of the story. Charac-
ters fall in and out of love, they
sell out, they protest, they lose
power just as they lose friends.
As MT&D junior Adam
Quinn, the show's director, puts
it, "'RENT' is about community.
It's about love. It's about accep-
tance. It's about finding light in
the darkness."
Larson passed away the day
of the show's original debut, and
since then the musical theater
community has revered "RENT,"
placing his work on a pedestal.
Directors can be wary of chang-
ing the show in any way, afraid
of desecrating the image Larson
initially created. However, Quinn
wanted to revamp this produc-
tion, casting away some of the
tropes that have become stale
over the course of 20 years.
"Any production you see, you
see Mark's plaid scarf, and Rog-
er's plaid pants, and Mimi wear-
ing the ridiculous blue leggings,
and all the staging is the exact
same," he said.
This summer, he tore into the
script, trying to understand the
driving desires of each character.
He wanted to do justice to Lar-
son's masterpiece but in a fresh
way. While no changes were
made to the script, he completely
reworked the staging and casting
of the production.
The production team audi-
tioned more than 300 students -

the largest number in MUSKET
history - for 16 roles, consolidat-
ing 45 ensemble parts into just
eight.
This intimacy and fluid-
ity between characters illustrates
just how universal the situations
in "RENT" are. LSA freshman
Nick Shaheen plays a drug dealer
in one scene then swiftly trans-
forms into the HIV support group
leader in the next.
By doing away with some of the
oft-used symbols of the musical,
Quinn hopes to surprise students
who love "RENT" and invigorate
those who aren't familiar with it.
Uncommon dedication
MUSKET rehearses at the
Student Theater Arts Complex,
a small, unremarkable building
tucked next to Michigan Stadi-
um. During their rehearsal times,
7 p.m. to 11 p.m. six days a week,
the area feels unreal - astill, cold
land bowing under the giant M.
It makes these students' commit-
ment seem all the more extraor-
dinary, as they spend 24 hours a
week rehearsing far from Central
Campus.
"You know when you are going
to do a show, especially like this,
that you really are in it so much
and you are investing so much
into the material," Vasquez said.
"There is going to be some wear
and tear on your voice, on your
body, on your emotional state, on
everything."
It's hard to imagine how it's
worth it, but for so many actors,
producers, crew members and
musicians, it's an integral part
of life. Talking with them isn't
like having a conversation with
an average student about their
extracurricular. Their commit-
ment is founded in an intense love
for what they do and for "RENT"
itself.
"For me this is so much greater
than my schoolwork, which is
bad, but this is what I love to do,"
LSA senior Kaci Friss, who plays
Joanne Jefferson, said.
Many MUSKET students plan
on going into musical theater, in
some role, for a living - so this is
their chance to show their abili-
ties without the pressures of a
career.
"In a professional setting you
have adults who have done this
a million times and they are just
sort of phoning it in," Vasquez
said. "But right now for every-
body this is sort of their shot to
get it right."
During a routine run-through
of the show Quinn intently takes
notes, muttering approval or
frustration under his breath.
Between acts, some actors whip
out their phones, finding respite
from the emotional wallop of the
show in Instagram, while others
stand to the side practicing their
songs with closed eyes.
MUSKET isn't a club. It isn't a
job - everyone is quick to point

out that they aren't getting paid.
MUSKET is an outlets for tal-
ented and ambitious students to
do what they are most passionate
about.
Diverse love of theater
Lucas and Rosenthal discussed
how campus - in particular
hordes of girls - has reacted to
the premiere of "RENT." There's
a special Greek-life package, cut-
ting down ticket prices ifa sorori-
ty or fraternity buys more than 30
tickets for their chapter. Walking
into the sorority houses proved
just how prevalent the story still
is.
"The moment you say the word
"RENT" people would be like
'Ahhh!' and all these girls would
be screaming," said Lucas.
More than some MUSKET
shows in the past, "RENT" incites
passion in its audience. People
connect to the show on so many
levels, regardless of their own
experiences.
"It's not just people who have
AIDS or who are living in this
bohemian lifestyle who can relate
to this," said LSA junior Kimberly
Hay, who plays Maureen John-
son. "I think it really speaks to
young people, and then you grow
up and it's still just so beautiful
and wonderful."
The universality of the show
not only brings a fresh vitality
to the performances, but is aug-
mented by having a cast with
diverse backgrounds.
While many cast members are
theater veterans, the production
is peppered with first-timers and
non-performance majors.
"I think the part we enjoy the
most is when we have someone
come into audition, and they are
an engineer, a political science
major, something completely ran-
dom -and they just end up being
incredible," Rosenthal said.
Engineering freshman Chani
Wereley plays Mimi Marquez, the
unpredictable and fragile young
stripper. When she belts out, her
talent is indistinguishable from
the performance majors.
"Chani has the most killer
voice," Rosenthal said. "She came
in for her audition, and we fell
over."
Though they both would love
to someday go into theater, Hay
is a double major in Drama and
Organizational Studies, while
Friss is studying Communica-
tions.
"MUSKET shows tend to
attract people who are really seri-
ous about what they are doing,"
Hay said. "Who either have been
trained or-have this really raw
special talent, and I really appre-
ciate that. I really learn so much
from all these different people."
However, there are some res-
ervations to working entirely
with students, especially varying
levels of expertise. In a show as
emotionally charged as "RENT"

- encompassing a whole range of
issues from disease and death to
sexuality and poverty - tension
is bound to develop.
"There is a lot of rawnessin the
rehearsal room," Vasquez said.
"There (have) been a lot of tears,
a lot of emotional outbursts and
explosions."
The characters aren't imagi-
nary for these dedicated actors.
Whether they connect with
Roger's need to retreat or Mimi's
naive uncertainty, these students
can't rehearse a scene and walk
away unaffected.
"We have had to take breaks
and come back, but that's the fun
of (it) because if you can't do that
you really are just playing pre-
tend," Vasquez said.
What unites everyone in the
production is an earnest love for
"RENT." Despite the frustra-
tions, fights and creative abrasion
that go along with this show's
heightened emotions, everyone
has parts of the story that they
love.
Students had different answers
for what was their favorite part of
the production: For some it's the
beginning number, and for some
the last. Others highlight a spe-
cific piano note - a melody that
unites two voices at the perfect
moment.
The word "chills" is thrown
around rather cavalierly in their
rehearsal room, but the messag-
es of this musical do cut deeper
than in many other shows. The
MUSKET players admit that they
didn't necessarily understand
these profound themes as chil-
dren watching "RENT" for the
first time.
"Now I am really thinking
about the story," Sheehan said.
"What is it like if you knew you
were going to die in six months?
What is it like when you know
that your friends are going to die
in six months?"
Though Quinn joked that we
shouldn't all want to dwell on
our own mortality after watch-
ing the show, "RENT" does
instill unavoidable introspec-
tion. "No day but today" is the
carpe diem-like tagline of the
show, and in some ways it speaks
to the partially satirical "YOLO"
culture.
"It doesn't mean you should
go do heroin," Yabrow said.
"But definitely think about the
people you have in your life
and what they mean to you, and
how thankful you are for having
them."
In a setting often filled
with competitive individuals,
"RENT" has the ability to unify
performers and audiences in
spite of professional orcircum-
stantial differences. Collectively
a lesson in sex and sorrow, futil-
ity and agency, presence and
ambition, "RENT" is more than
just a show about HIV/AIDS.
As Rosenthal said, "'RENT' is
ultimately about love."
