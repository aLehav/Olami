ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

ADMINISTRATION

Percentage of 

minorities in first-
year cohort is the 
highest since 2005 

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

and LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporters

The 
percentage 
of 

underrepresented minorities in 
this year’s freshman class is the 
highest since 2005, according 
to enrollment figures released 
by the University early Monday 
morning.

Underrepresented 
minority 

students represent 12.8 percent 
of the 2015 freshman class, 
a 
2.8-percent 
increase 
over 

last 
fall’s 
entering 
cohort. 

Minority 
students 
accounted 

for 13.8 percent of the incoming 
class in 2005, the year before 
Michigan voters banned the 
use of affirmative action in the 
admissions process.

The 
percentage 
of 
Black, 

Hispanic and Native American 
students all increased over last 
year.

The undergraduate student 

body 
and 
overall 
students 

saw less drastic increases in 
diversity. The percentage of 
Black undergraduate students 
increased by .15 percent and the 
percentage of Black students 
overall increased by .19 percent.

Total enrollment this fall 

stands at 43,651, an increase of 
.06 percent (26 students) from 
last year’s overall enrollment.

Undergraduate 
enrollment, 

however, 
decreased 
by 
83 

students, marking a .3-percent 
decrease. 
 
Meanwhile, 
the 

number 
of 
graduate 
and 

professional students on campus 
increased by .7 percent (109 
students).

The freshman class decreased 

by more than 400 students 
since last year, representing the 
smallest incoming class size 
since 2008, when the class size 
was 5,783 students.

Last year, University Provost 

Martha Pollack outlined a plan 
to curb over-enrollment after 
the University enrolled 500 
more students than intended for 
the freshman class.

“We have been over-enrolling 

every year for the past five 
years and we have to stop this,” 
Pollack said at a September 2014 
Board of Regents meeting. “I’m

The University of Michigan 

Institute 
for 
Research 
on 

Women and Gender held a 
panel 
discussion 
Monday 

titled “Incarcerated Women: A 
Conversation About Realities.”

The event was held in part to 

provide context for Tuesday’s 
campus 
lecture 
by 
Piper 

Kerman, author of “Orange Is 
the New Black: My Year in a 
Women’s 
Prison.” 
Kerman’s 

memoir was the inspiration for 
the Netflix series adaptation, 
“Orange is the New Black.”

Members 
of 
the 
panel 

discussed 
the 
variety 
of 

challenges unique to female 
inmates. 
Some 
panelists 

emphasized 
the 
abuses 

that 
incarcerated 
women 

experience 
are 
precisely 

because of their gender.

According to panelist and 

Law Prof. Amanda Alexander, 
a Soros Justice Fellow in the 
Child Advocacy Law Clinic and 
the Detroit Center for Family 
Advocacy, incarcerated women 
often face losing parental rights 
over their children, and said the 
average sentence length for a 
parent in Michigan is three to 
four years.

Alexander also discussed the 

negligible rights afforded to 
inmates who give birth during 
their sentence. She said, in 
Michigan, women who give birth 
in prison have very little access 
to prenatal care and are only 
allotted 24 hours to spend with 
their newborn in the hospital 
after delivery. Additionally, some 
other states allow incarcerated 
women to pump breast milk for 
their children, but Michigan 
does not.

BOOK REVIEW
Interesting but 
tedious new 
Smith memoir

‘M Train’ can 
be beautiful, 

meandering and 

exasperating

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO

Daily Arts Writer

Patti Smith is really cool. She’s 

also funny, extraordinarily well-
read and well-traveled, multi-
talented and palpably kind and 
compassionate. 
She’s the kind of 
person you want 
to nurse a cup of 
coffee with for 
hours and hours, 
talking 
about 

everything 
on 

your mind, and 
things you didn’t 
even realize were.

Smith is best known as a 

musician 
— 
her 
1975 
album 

Horses is considered a watershed 
in the development of punk 
rock, among many other popular 
records and singles. In recent 
years, she has also received 
acclaim as a writer, winning the 
National Book Award for “Just 
Kids,” a memoir of her passionate, 
tumultuous relationship with the 
acclaimed photographer Robert 
Mapplethorpe 
and 
their 
life 

together in the bohemian art scene 
of 1970s New York. And, this past 
week, she released a new book, the 
enigmatically titled “M Train.”

If you’ve read “Just Kids,” 

or decide to read “M Train,” 
you’ll know what I meant in 
the 
first 
paragraph. 
Smith’s 

writing is a stream of passionate 
consciousness. Take this passage 
from “Just Kids”: “There were 
days, rainy gray days, when the 
streets of Brooklyn were worthy 
of a photograph, every window 
the lens of a leica. We gathered our 
colored pencils and sheets of paper 
and drew like wild, feral children 
into the night until, exhausted, we 
fell into bed. We lay in each other’s 
arms, still awkward but happy, 
exchanging breathless kisses into 
sleep.”

“Just Kids” worked because 

it 
had 
that 
Mapplethorpe 

relationship as a narrative baseline, 
off of which Smith could riff. You 
could forgive her occasionally vatic 
prose and erratic scene setting, 
because the book still told a 
specific, heartfelt story. “M Train,” 
heartfelt and passionate as it is, 
suffers from a lack of specificity. 
It’s a meandering lecture of a 
book, often interesting, sometimes 
beautiful, but also tedious and 
exasperating.

“M 
Train” 
is 
seemingly 

structured as a series of dreams, 
reflections and flashbacks that 
Smith has while sitting in her 
favorite Greenwich Village café, 
which she attends every morning 
for a sacrament of black coffee, 
bread and olive oil. These vignettes 
trigger further ones, and they 
others, until you’ve moved with 

Pending Senate 
Assembly vote 
could persuade 
provost to delay

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Faculty 
concern 
over 
the 

impending release of course 
evaluation 
data 
has 
caused 

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack to reconsider the current 
timeline for such a release.

During 
her 
comments 
at 

Monday’s 
SACUA 
meeting, 

Pollack said she would be willing 
to reconsider the release date, 
pending a vote at the Senate 
Assembly meeting later this 
month.

“If the Senate Assembly votes 

no, I am happy to slow it down, 

but I generally need this group 
to meet with (Central Student 
Government) 
and 
(Rackham 

Student Government) and talk 
with them,” Pollack said. “This 
all came up because the students 
asked for it at least three years 
ago now.”

Pollack 
has 
formed 
a 

committee to create a new tool, 
in place of the current course 
evaluation, to better meet the 
needs of faculty and students. 
She invited SACUA to appoint 
a member to the committee, 
which will also include members 
from 
student 
government 

and evaluation experts at the 
University.

At 
a 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
meeting last month, Engineering 
Prof. James Holloway, the vice 
provost for global and engaged 
education, 
announced 
that 

course evaluation data could 

be published as soon as this 
semester.

The 
decision 
provoked 

pushback 
from 
faculty 

governance, which criticized the 
administration for constructing 
a plan without extensive faculty 
consultation.

“It has not been debated 

at SACUA and it has not been 
debated at Senate Assembly, 
and so we feel like there hasn’t 
been enough broad consultation 
because this is something that 
affects everyone, faculty and 
students,” 
said 
Comparative 

Literature 
Prof. 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, SACUA’s chair, at the 
time.

Weineck 
said 
another 

committee with faculty input will 
need to be formed to determine 
the best way to release the data — 
an issue that she noted is separate 
from what type of instrument

for Ann Arbor’s next city 
administrator.

The Ann Arbor City Council 

voted last week to authorize 
the 
Council 
Administration 

Committee to serve as a five-

the current city administrator, 
announced plans in August to 
leave the post for a new job as 
city manager in Salem, Ore. He 
is set to depart in November. 

“It’s a larger community than 

Ann Arbor and a professional 
opportunity that will help me in 
my professional development,” 
Powers said in an interview 
with 
The 
Michigan 
Daily. 

“It’s 
a 
larger 
organization, 

with 
more 
responsibilities 

and opportunities to help a

New campus group to raise 
awareness about mental health

Wolverines for Life forms line 
to promote organ donations

Organization plans 
to focus on bullying, 
suicide prevention

By ALEX ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

A recent addition to the Univer-

sity community, the national orga-
nization “umttr,” is dedicated to 
providing the necessary resources 
to promote good mental health 
among students. Short for “you 
matter,” the group specifically 
raises awareness about bullying, 
depression and suicide. 

After organizing and planning 

for several years, the club became 
official last month. 

High school student Erik Rob-

erts founded the national orga-
nization umttr in Montgomery 
County, Md. following the suicide 
of his close friend and fellow ath-
lete, Evan Rosenstock. The Uni-
versity is the first college campus 
to host a umttr chapter.

LSA senior Allison Rosenstock, 

Evan Rosenstock’s sister, along 
with LSA sophomore Jane Smith, 
worked to bring the organization 
to campus after meeting on the 
Michigan Equestrian Team last 
year. Since both have had personal 
experiences with family mem-
bers suffering from mental health 
issues, they hope to combat the 
stigma associated with mental 
illness through the new student 
organization.

“I think it is crucial that umttr 

started as an organization by 
young adults, for young adults,” 
Rosenstock said in an e-mail to 
The Michigan Daily. “We really 
strive to implement peer-led pro-
grams that have proved more 
effective in people ages 10-24.”

Umttr is partnered with several 

other organizations, including the 
American Foundation for Suicide 
Prevention and the Campaign 
to Change Direction, a nonprofit 
campaign aiming to raise aware-
ness about mental health issues.

The umttr website outlines 

five signs of emotional suffering, 
including withdrawal, agitation, 
hopelessness, decline in personal 
care and change in personal-
ity. Rosenstock ultimately hopes 
to implement the Campaign to 
Change Direction into the Uni-
versity’s curriculum, perhaps as 
a requirement class for incoming 
freshmen, similar to the AlcoholE-
du program.

“I hope that we can implement 

a similar program where students 
are required to learn the five signs 
of mental suffering that the Cam-
paign to Change Direction pro-
motes,” Rosenstock said.

In an e-mail to the Daily, Smith 

said she believes umttr will pro-
vide a place for students who need 
a community of individuals who 
understand the hardships of han-
dling mental health issues.

“I hope to create a safe place 

for students to talk about their 
personal struggles with mental 
health-related issues,” Smith said. 
“I want to create a group of friends 
that cares about what each person 
is going through and can relate. 
My goal for this is not to become a 
therapy session, but rather a close-
knit community.”

Smith credits the Michigan 

Equestrian Team community with 
helping her heal from tragedy in 
her family related to suicide. She 
hopes umttr can be a supportive 
community for anyone in a similar 
situation.

Both Rosenstock and Smith 

said similar University organi-
zations, such as Active Minds, 
Healthy Minds, and the Wolverine 
Support Network, among others, 
have helped establish umttr on 
campus. However, the main dif-
ference between the organizations 
already on campus and umttr is 
umttr’s additional interest in help-
ing student athletes.

“The athletic portion of the 

organization is crucial because 
both Allison and I agree that ath-
letics is valuable in providing a 
healthy body and mind while 
bringing people together,” Smith 
said.

At the heart of umttr is a three-

event, LiveOnNY

Daily Staff Reporter

Twenty-two 
patients 
are 

estimated to die each day in 
the United States because not 
enough organ donors are avail-
able 
for 
organ 
transplants. 

More than 122,000 patients 
nationwide are on the waitlist 
for organ transplants, 3,500 of 
whom reside in Michigan. Many 
diseases like leukemia and sickle 
cell anemia require a bone mar-
row transplant to be cured.

With these facts in mind, 

members of Wolverines for 
Life — a campus organization 
focused on educating the com-
munity about the importance of 
organ donations — donned yel-
low T-shirts with the hashtag 
#wolverineswontwait and lined 
up across the Diag on Monday. 

They encouraged passersby to 
join the line, drawing 100 people 
over the course of the day.

The organization collaborates 

with the American Red Cross, 
Be the Match, Gift of Life Michi-
gan and Eversight Michigan as 
part of its educational and phil-
anthropic efforts.

Holly Eliot is the faculty 

adviser for Blood Drives United, 
another student organization 
that was present for the line’s 
formation Monday. Eliot, also a 
project manager at the Univer-
sity’s Transplant Center and for 
Wolverines for Life, said Mon-
day’s line of people was a visual 
element meant to draw a com-
parison to lines of patients who 
have to wait for organ trans-
plants.

Eliot added that the event was 

based on a similar “flash-line” 
event called “Hate the Wait” in 
New York City organized by a 
network of organ donors in New 
York called LiveOnNY.

Jennifer Helmer, east Michi-

gan liaison for Secretary of State 
Ruth Johnson, attended to show 
Johnson’s support for the event. 

Since taking office in 2011, John-
son has advocated to expand the 
Michigan Organ Donor Regis-
try.

In 2011, only 27 percent of 

adult Michiganders were on the 
donor registry, placing the state 
near the bottom nationally. As 
of earlier this year, the number 
has risen to 4.1 million people 
— about 52 percent of the state’s 
adults.

“(Johnson) felt like she need-

ed to do something to save lives,” 
Helmer said. “She wants to give 
hope to those who are waiting 
to live. She is very committed to 
cause and passionate about it.”

Despite the recent spike in 

state donors, Internal Medicine 
Prof. John Magee said there is 
still a long way to go to meet the 
patients’ needs.

“The real issue is we’re still 

way far behind where we need 
to be,” Magee said. “But every-
body helps. It’s their opportu-
nity to be a hero. Many students, 
faculty and alumni want to have 
an impact around the world, 
and the best way (to do that) is 

CAMPUS TRADITION

Defend the Diag stakes out Block ‘M’ before Saturday

There’s currently a little camp-

site surrounding the Diag’s sacred 
block ‘M’. The brothers of Theta Xi 
— together with the sisters of Delta 
Phi Epsilon — spared a few minutes 
to elaborate on what exactly they are 
up to. 

The Michigan Daily spoke with 

LSA sophomore Austin Fregene, 
School of Information sophomore 
Holden Spencer and Engineering 
alum Chris Burtraw about the frater-
nity’s tradition of defending the Diag 
from vandalism or pranks in advance 
of the annual game against Michigan 
State University.

Other than defending the Diag, 

what are you doing here?

Fregene: We’re raising money for 

the National Multiple Sclerosis Soci-

ety and the Cystic Fibrosis Foun-
dation as well ... and preserving a 
tradition on campus. You can help us 
out by contributing to our GoFundMe 
online.

What do you intend on doing if any 

‘visitors’ show up?

Fregene: We actually have already 

had some visitors last night, a couple 
kids from State came up and chilled 
in Mason Hall scouting us out, came 
by, and we could tell that they were 
definitely prepared to do something, 
but fortunately they saw us and didn’t 
come. That’s day one, and we have 
another four left to go. We plan on 
doing this every single night 24/7.

How do you plan on covering the 

ground over the course of the week?

Spencer: Each brother is required 

to be here for a minimum of eight 
hours, for the entire week, and all our 
associate members are required to be 
here for 12. It’s pretty laid back, broth-
ers hang out here between classes. We 
throw a football around, and enjoy the 
weather while it lasts.

Have you all managed to protect 

and not step on the ‘M’?

Spencer: It’s been hard, but we’ve 

all managed not to step on the ‘M’. 

What else do you hope to 

accomplish here?

Fregene: I feel as though this 

event in particular is a pretty good 
example that Greek life isn’t com-
pletely about party culture. We can 

band together and do something for 
philanthropy, and really preserve 
the tradition of school spirit.

Any alumni here? Do you have 

any memories?

Burtraw: Last year I spent the 

night right here, on this very couch, 
in this very spot. It was very, very 
cold, I had three blankets on the 
whole night.

How are you all feeling about the 

game on Saturday?

Burtraw: It’s going to be a good 

solid game, it’ll be fun to watch, and 
the atmosphere will be fantastic.

to donate blood or sign up to be an 
organ donor because you can fun-
damentally save a life with that.”

LSA freshman Parker Schaub 

said he participated without hav-
ing had prior knowledge of the 
event because he realizes the 
importance of organ donation.

“I just happened to find the line 

in middle of the Diag, and thought 
that I wanted to join,” Schaub said. 
“I think it’s really important that 
people know that they can donate 
blood and organs and know how 
strong the need is.”

In addition to raising aware-

ness about organ donation, the 
event also advertised the kickoff 
event for the annual Blood Battle 
between the University and Ohio 
State University. The event will be 
held on Nov. 1, from 8 a.m. to 4:45 
p.m. Blood Battle lasts during the 
entire month of November.

on-three basketball tournament to 
commemorate Evan, who played 
basketball in high school. Smith 
and Rosenstock hope this will 
change the way athletic programs 
view mental health issues.

“Because my brother, Evan, was 

an avid basketball player, besides 
the fact that exercise is a great 
outlet for mental health issues, I 
see the athletic portion as remem-
bering my brother as an athlete,” 
Rosenstock said.

Since umttr at the University 

was approved in late September, 
the group was unable to be at Fes-
tifall and therefore started the year 
with a small following. However, 
the leaders of umttr on campus 
were able to attend the So Cool, So 
Just social justice student organi-
zation fair in the Diag last month.

On Oct. 24, umttr will attend the 

Defeat Depression Dash, an annual 
5K in honor of University student 
Garrick Roemer, who was a mem-
ber of the University’s track team 
and lost his life to suicide in 2014.

will be used.

“We actually need a committee 

that looks closely as the way it’s 
released,” Weineck said. “That 
is just as important as having 
a committee that looks at the 
questions themselves.”

Faculty 
concern 
over 
the 

release 
of 
course 
evaluation 

data resulted in the LSA Student 
Government withdrawing their 
request for the data. Biology 
Prof. John Lehman, a SACUA 
member, 
predicted 
Central 

Student Government would soon 
do the same. He said students are 
willing to wait for the data if it 
means developing a more helpful 
instrument.

“Talking 
to 
the 
student 

governance 
leaders, 
they’re 

saying none of the students really 
care about this as much as some 
faculty are really passionately 
against it,” Lehman said. “I asked 
the students in my oceanography 
class how important this was 
to them and they said, ‘Not at 
all.’ They said they had other 
ways to find out what they want 
to know about these courses. I 
mean we’re talking about upper-
division students.”

Business Prof. Dave Wright, 

a SACUA member, said if the 
committee fails to create a 
more effective instrument for 
collecting 
course 
evaluation 

data, the University should opt 
not to release data at all.

“If the body of experts comes 

to the conclusion that there is no 
reliable, valid way to measure 
this, then we shouldn’t have it at 
all,” he said. “At some point you 
have to reach the conclusion, is 
the signal to noise ratio worth it? 
Is it positive? We know there’s 
noise, we know there may even 
be bias. But the question is, is it 
better than no information at 
all?”

SACUA 
members 
also 

expressed 
concern 
over 
the 

administration’s 
decision 
to 

switch to Canvas beginning in 
the fall 2016 semester.

Pollack and Laura Patterson, 

associate vice president and chief 

information officer, announced 
the decision in an e-mail to 
students, faculty and staff last 
month.

Weineck said there is concern 

among faculty about making the 
transition that quickly.

“I think one of the potential 

problems 
coming 
down 
the 

pipeline is Canvas,” Weineck said. 
“It seems that some problems 
have come up that didn’t come 
up in the pilot and they concern 
the migration of course size from 
CTools to Canvas.”

In response, Pollack said the 

transition date would not be 
delayed. She encouraged the 
board to forward their questions 
and concerns to Patterson.

Wright 
questioned 
the 

tradeoffs 
associated 
with 

delaying the switch.

“My question would be what 

is the real cost of pushing it back 
a year?” he asked. “And what 
happens if I don’t transition to 
Canvas — in other words, how 
enforceable is this?”

Pharmacy Prof. David Smith, a 

SACUA member, said the faculty 
has no choice but to transition 
next fall.

“It’s pretty enforceable, you’ve 

got to convert over,” Smith said. 
“You don’t have a choice, you’ve 
got to learn it and give them 
feedback on things you need that 
they don’t have that will help you 
do a better job.”

To aid their transition, faculty 

can consult online resources, 
the 
University’s 
Information 

and Technology Services Center 
and Canvas support, available 
through phone, e-mail and live 
chat 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week.

 “There’s a Canvas support 

team but they don’t seem to be 
particularly well trained because 
I get a lot of e-mails from faculty 
saying ‘I go to Canvas support 
and they don’t know the answer,’ 
” Weineck said. “Once you get 
high enough up in the Canvas 
support team you will eventually 
get to someone who knows the 
answer and who will be very 
helpful. But knowing faculty, a 
lot of faculty will get to this in 
August.” 

Smith from Suriname to Tokyo 
to Detroit to Tangiers. Woven 
throughout are brief, yet aching, 
references to her late husband 
Fred “Sonic” Smith, a musician 
who passed away in 1994, and 
whose memory seems to haunt 
many of these places. Other 
tropes include Smith’s passion 
for visiting, and tending to, the 
graves of her literary heroes (Jean 
Genet, 
Rimbaud, 
Rynosuke 

Akutagawa), her love of coffee, her 
attachment to detective shows, 
and the inevitable nostalgia that 
accompanies aging.

The book has its moments. 

There are lines so poetic and pure 
that you want to etch them on 
the inside of your eyelids. After 
losing the photographs she once 
took of Sylvia Plath’s grave in 
autumn, she returns years later 
to take new ones: “There is now 
one of Sylvia in spring. It is very 
nice, but lacking the shimmering 
quality of the lost ones. Nothing 
can be truly replicated. Not a 
love, not a jewel, not a single line.” 
After losing both her husband 
and her brother in a short period 
of time, Smith recalls “hours 
sitting in Fred’s favorite chair, 
dreading my own imagination. I 
rose and performed small tasks 
with the mute concentration of 
one imprisoned in ice.”

And, if nothing else, “M Train” 

is a series of recommendations. I 
walked away with a page-long list 
of things to read: Jean Genet’s “The 
Thief’s Journal,” Roberto Bolano’s 
“2666,” Haruki Murakami’s “The 
Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,” Mikhail 
Bulgakov’s 
“The 
Master 
and 

Margarita.” That’s not including 
dozens of poems, songs, paintings, 
TV shows and a veritable atlas of 
cities and towns to explore. Smith 
intended it this way, claiming, “I 
offer my world on a platter filled 
with allusions.”

But, ironically, it’s in offering 

so much of her unedited world 
that Smith makes things difficult 
for the reader. Books are like belly 
buttons: They can be innies, ones 
that force you to look deep into 
yourself, outies, ones that force 

you to confront the vastness of 
the world and all its knowledge, 
or the rare combo of both. 
“M Train” is, unfortunately, 
an outie. As you read page 
after page chronicling Smith’s 
diverse adventures, friendships 
and musings, but with no real 
unifying theme, the whole thing 
feels like an extended brag, a 250-
page account of how amazing her 
life has been.

Yes, this is Patti Smith’s book 

about Patti Smith’s life. But 
the “narrative” is so loose, and 
yet so relentless, that reading 
it is exhausting rather than 
enveloping. And in a book of 
moments, the beautiful ones stand 
out, but so do the cringe-worthy, 
like this description of Veracruz, 

Mexico: “The air was perfect, 
like milk from the breast of the 
great mother. Milk that could be 
suckled by all her children — the 
babes of Juàrez, Harlem, Belfast, 
Bangladesh.” 

So what would you get out of 

reading this book? Some beautiful 
prose, enough book titles to keep 
you reading for years, a definitive 
stance on the pleasures of drinking 
coffee alone. But really, “M Train” 
’s existence is, in and of itself, 
an exhortation to live a fuller 
life. Drive across the country on 
a whim, it says. Bake your own 
bread, go to the movies, learn how 
to play chess, whatever. Write 
poems and take photos. Travel. 
Fall in love. Have stories that could 
fill a book.

The 
conversation 
turned 

multiple times to the “wars 
on drugs and crime” in the 
United States, and how these 
policies have caused higher 
incarceration rates of both men 
and women.

Carol Jacobsen, a panelist 

and professor of both women’s 
studies and Art & Design, noted 
that many women who commit 
serious crimes such as homicide 
do so as an act of survival. 
The murder may have been a 
response 
to 
life-threatening 

physical or sexual abuse, or 
to issues related to poverty or 
drugs.

Panelist 
Heather 
Ann 

Thompson, 
an 
Afroamerican 

and African Studies professor, 
echoed this point.

“Murder is murder, isn’t it?” 

Thompson asked. “Or is it?” 

The panelists unanimously 

condemned the closed nature 
of prisons. They discussed how 
difficult it is for researchers and 
visitors to gain access to prisons 
and how this has resulted in 
critical 
gaps 
in 
knowledge 

about the lived experience of 
prisoners.

“In our society, we take it as 

normal that prisons are these 
closed 
spaces,” 
Thompson 

said. “(Prisons are) so closed 
that there is no data on how 
many hours prisoners spend in 
isolation — no one has access to 

collect it.”

The panelists pointed out 

that though Michigan’s only 
women’s prison, the Women’s 
Huron 
Valley 
Correctional 

Facility, is 15 minutes away from 
the University’s campus, many 
University students have not 
heard of it.

Panelist 
Ruby 
Tapia, 
a 

professor of women’s studies 
and English, said it is important 
to 
analyze 
representations 

of 
lived 
experiences 
of 

incarcerated women, including 
but not limited to “Orange is the 
New Black.”

Moderator Valerie Jenness, 

a senior visiting scholar at the 
University’s Institute on Women 
and Gender and a professor at 
the University of California, 

Irvine, asked panelists about a 
passage from Kerman’s memoir.

In the passage, Kerman tells 

the story of a newly released 
prisoner who told local media 
she had a “magnificent” and 
positive experience in prison. 
Some inmates still incarcerated 
in the prison were angry with 
this description because they 
felt it was false.

Tapia noted that some women 

who have been incarcerated 
have 
expressed 
the 
same 

feelings toward “Orange is the 
New Black” — that the narrative 
represented is a narrow one 
that may not encompass the 
multitude of lived experiences.

Kerman’s 
address 
begins 

Tuesday at 5:10 p.m. in Rackham 
Auditorium. 

not happy about it.”

With the highest proportion 

of underrepresented minority 
students in a freshman class in 10 
years, enrollment numbers saw 
significant gains toward a more 
diversified student body.

In the freshman class alone, 

the number of Black students 
admitted 
increased 
by 
58 

students — a community which 
made up 3.84 percent of the 
freshman class in 2014 and 5.11 
percent of the class in 2015. In the 
state of Michigan, 14.3 percent of 
the population is Black.

“The campus — admissions, 

financial aid, recruitment teams 
and our partners across the 
university — worked together 
in response to the charge to 
achieve our target class size 
and find ways, consistent with 
state law, to bring further 
diversity to our student body 
with this class,” Kedra Ishop, 
associate vice president for 
enrollment management, wrote 
in a press release. “We are 
pleased with the progress and 
want to continue our forward 
momentum in 2016.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said in an interview 
with the Daily last month that 
he expected to see improvement 
within 
the 
student 
body’s 

diversity enrollment as early as 

this semester, a reflection of the 
University’s effort to package 
financial 
aid 
awards 
with 

admission decisions.

The University received a 

record number of applicants 
this year and admitted 26.24 
percent of those applicants. This 
fall, 6,071 students of the 13,584 
admitted actually enrolled into 
the University, resulting in a 
45-percent yield.

In-state 
students 
represent 

more of the student body this year, 
making up 57 percent of students 
this year compared to 55 percent 
of students last fall. The University 
accepted 50 percent of in-state 
student applications, while only 
accepting 20 percent of out-of-
state applicants. There were 31,573 

more 
out-of-state 
applications 

than in-state applications.

With regard to socioeconomic 

diversity, 
the 
percentage 
of 

freshmen eligible for Federal 
Pell Grants rose by 1.1 percent 
from last fall. First-generation 
students make up 8.5 percent 
of the incoming class, and low-
income students make up 10.2 
percent of the class.

According to a press release, 

the 
University 
continues 
to 

invest more money in financial 
aid than ever before, increasing 
aid to undergraduate, need-
based financial aid by 8.1 percent 
since last year.

The 
increases 
in 

underrepresented 
minority 

enrollment come in wake of an 

eventful two years, during which 
members 
of 
the 
University’s 

Black Student Union called on 

the University to increase Black 
enrollment and improve campus 
climate.

fast,” Powers said. “It’s been an 
enjoyable four years.”

The administration committee, 

comprised of Mayor Christopher 
Taylor (D) and Councilmembers 
Sabra Briere (D 
–Ward 1), Stephen 

Kunselman (D–Ward 3), Chuck 
Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) and 
Graydon Krapohl (D–Ward 4), 
will narrow down the list of 
potential applicants for the post.

Briere said Powers’ successor 

will have big shoes to fill.

“The biggest challenge we 

face is looking for someone who 
will build on what Steve Powers 
has already done and that’s a 
challenge,” she said.

In prior years, the council 

appointed a search committee 
separate 
from 
the 
standing 

administration 
committee. 

During the search for Powers, 
a four-person group of council 
members conducted the search.

“The process is not that 

different than last time,” Taylor 
said in an interview. “It changed 
because we wanted an extra 
council member to broaden the 
set of inputs into the search 
process.”

Briere said the process has 

also 
changed 
because 
the 

administration 
committee 
is 

responsible for evaluating the city 
administrator’s job performance. 
Upon Powers’ departure, the 
committee will contact members 
of staff and City Council to 
compile an exit evaluation.

“To take advantage of the 

council members who are already 
conducting the evaluation seems 
efficient,” she said.

The 
committee, 
with 
the 

assistance of a search firm, will 
narrow the national search to 
about three candidates. From 
there, finalists will participate 
in an interview with each of the 
council members, as well as public 
panels and meetings involving 
city employees, businesses and 
the Ann Arbor community.

“The council is now starting 

to develop a recruitment profile 
for the position that will then be 
made available nationally and 

candidates will be encouraged 
to 
consider 
the 
wonderful 

opportunity that Ann Arbor 
provides,” Powers said.

At last Monday’s meeting, 

there 
were 
some 
concerns 

regarding the search procedure. 
Councilmember Jane Lumm (I–
Ward 2) said she did not feel the 
process was inclusive enough.

“I’ve been through other city 

administrator 
searches 
and 

actually, I feel that already the 
process is not terribly inclusive 
as it could be,” Lumm told the 
council last Monday. “Previously 
when I sat here, we engaged 
all the council members and 
administrator 
profiles, 
we 

engaged the community.”

Other 
council 
members 

responded to Lumm’s concerns 
and said they felt the process was 
inclusive enough for the initial 
stages of the search. The council 
will have the chance to speak 
with each of the final candidates 
and hold public interviews. The 
final decision is also up to a vote 
of the council as a whole.

In the past, senior members 

of City Council comprised the 
administration committee. This 
time, the committee members’ 
levels of expertise and seniority 
vary.

“Getting that cross section of 

experience and expectations has 
already been done for the admin 
committee and that was what we 
were looking for the last time we 
did this search,” Briere said.

On 
Monday, 
the 
council 

also approved the committee’s 
recommendation to hire the 
executive search firm, Affion 
Public, which was the same 
search firm hired to find Powers. 
The firm was recommended to 
the council by Human Resources 
Director Robyn Wilkerson.

The HR department told 

the administration committee 
that surveying for other search 
firms might delay the process 
by six weeks.

“Affion has done a number of 

employee searches successfully 
for the city in the past, and they 
were one of the three different 
search firms that were considered 
who had a record of success with 
the city,” Briere said. “They were 

selected in part because of that 
record of success and because 
they had the staffing capacity to 
do a thorough but rapid search.”

The committee has created a 

job description for the position 
and has sent it to the council for 
review. Once the council has 
approved the job description, 
Affion will create a profile for 
the position and conduct a 
national search.

“The profile is created after the 

firm talks to council members, 
staff and members of the public,” 
Taylor said.

The council also approved 

a proposal Monday night to 
raise the posted salary for 
the position from $160,000 to 
$175,000. The HR department 
found the median salary for city 
administrators in cities with 
populations between 100,000 
and 249,000 was about $167,000. 
The council voted to raise the 
salary in hopes of drawing top-
tier candidates.

In deciding to switch jobs, 

Powers accepted a pay raise 
of more than $50,000. He will 
now earn $210,000 a year, with 
added perks. When Powers 
first began his role as city 
administrator in 2011, he was 
earning $145,000 a year. In 
October 2014, Powers’ pay was 
raised by $14,500 to $159,500.

Ann Arbor’s Chief Financial 

Officer Tom Crawford will serve 
as interim city administrator.

He will receive a pay raise 

of about $1,500 a month for the 
duration of the interim posting. 
Taylor said the timeline for the 
search process is still up in the 
air.

“The search process will 

take a good amount of time,” 
he said. “It’s going to take us a 
couple of months.”

Powers said his successor has to 

be able to view Ann Arbor for its 
values and unique characteristics.

“An administrator needs to 

view the city as more than just 
police and fire,” he said. “It is 
a community that has values 
that are very important to a 
council and the administrator 
is expected to believe in an 
organization that is consistent 
with those values.”

T

hough summer’s beginning 
to fade into cooler shades 
and colored leaves, it seems 

like everyone I 
know is planning 
for 
next 
sum-

mer. Most are 
thinking 
about 

internships 
or 

even 
full-time 

employment 
offers. 
I’d 
be 

lying if I said I 
wasn’t.

I already have 

a 
spreadsheet 

lined with publi-
cations where I want to intern. I’ve 
linked to their employment pages. I 
have a list of HR contacts with whom 
I’ll follow up, and I already have 
fragments of cover letters completed 
and saved in a computer folder.

That may sound intense to you 

— I’d certainly consider it exces-
sive. But I’m so concerned about 
my plans this summer because I’m 
from a lower socioeconomic back-
ground, and I’ve come to realize I’m 
frequently at a disadvantage when 
seeking a job.

I started realizing this last winter, 

when I applied to every journalism 
internship imaginable. Sitting on 
the UGLi’s second floor, I overheard 
some girls talking. One was talking 
about her summer plans.

She mentioned giving her resume 

to her father, and how he “needed” 
to get a move-on with helping her 
find summer plans. Apparently, he’s 
a lawyer who knows doctors that 
could hook her up with a medicine-
related internship.

She continued to complain.
I sat in my chair, both confused 

and incredibly frustrated. Aside 
from how annoying her complaining 
was, how was it possible that some-
one could just “hook you up” with 
a job? Why was I working so hard 
while her dad did her work?

In that moment, I experienced 

the “socio” aspect of socioeconomic 

status. It’s something even I some-
times forget about. Many people can 
flatten socioeconomic issues into 
problems strictly related to income. 
For instance, not being able to afford 
an education at a better out-of-state 
college, or avoiding eating out 
with friends because you don’t 
have the money.

However, lacking social ben-

efits that come from money are also 
problematic. The girl in the UGLi — 
like many others on this campus — 
comes from a family earning a high 
income. These high-earning careers 
usually come with prestige. Presti-
gious jobs serve as opportunities to 
connect with others in prestigious 
jobs, and therefore, wealthy parents 
oftentimes hook their kids up with 
connections in the student’s desired 
industry. Networking, or talking 
to these professionals, frequent-
ly serves as an “in” to finding an 
internship. Either the student gets 
connected to the professional’s job, 
or uses the contact to connect with 
more people until they have multiple 
“ins” at a company.

Professional connections don’t 

flow from my parents. I lived with 
a single mother, and she worked 
as a restaurant manager. My mom 
couldn’t connect me to anyone work-
ing in my planned career. While not 
every wealthy parent has the right 
connection for their kid’s career, 
and while prior experience, skills 
and grades are also relevant factors, 
having a connection to a company is 
incredibly important.

Connections count a lot in the 

working world — more than you 
might think. In a 2014 study by Syra-
cuse University, 57 percent of gradu-
ating alumni found a job through 
networking. The next closest, at a 
mere 15 percent, came through on-
campus recruiting, showing how big 
of a role networking plays.

Networking also helps you stand 

out in a large applicant pool. A recent 
study revealed that 6 percent of the 
applicants had a reference in the 

company, yet they represented 29 
percent of the new hires.

There are certainly other ways 

to network and “know” someone in 
the internship process, but college 
students are still kids, meaning 
meeting and growing profession-
al networks of working adults is 
incredibly difficult. 

So, it stings when others don’t rec-

ognize their privilege. I take finding 
a stable, high-paying job seriously, as 
it represents the final key to ensur-
ing I can escape the difficulties I’ve 
experienced growing up. Often-
times, I feel like I have to work twice 
as hard to get half as far as some of 
my friends. It feels like I’m swim-
ming upstream in a battle that I real-
ly want to win.

Now, I’m not shaming my friends 

with well-connected parents. If 
you had a connection that could 
help you find an internship, it’d be 
crazy not to take advantage. How-
ever, I’m discussing this topic for 
two reasons:

1) If your parent helps you get 

an internship, you should take a 
moment to recognize how privi-
leged you are. While you’re likely 
qualified for whatever you’re doing, 
you got that position in part due to 
luck. There are many people who 
were just as qualified but didn’t get 
the position because they didn’t 
have that fraction of luck.

2) Help your friends, particularly 

those of lower socioeconomic sta-
tus, take advantage of your resourc-
es. If you know a friend pining for 
a marketing internship, and your 
mom’s a marketer, do a solid and 
connect the two over the phone. 
That informational interview could 
help your friend snag an internship.

The professional world is fre-

quently dominated by who you know, 
not what you know, but there are 
ways to help those who currently 
suffer the consequences.

Socioeconomic growing pains

MICHAEL 
SCHRAMM

A

s a columnist, there are a 
few positions that — though 
important — are so widely 

accepted 
and 

uncontroversial 
that writing a 
column centered 
on 
one 
would 

feel like a cop-
out. I’m talking 
about positions 
like 
“cigarettes 

are harmful to 
your health” and 
“animal 
abuse 

is bad.” It’s not 
that 
tobacco 

use 
and 
ani-

mal abuse aren’t public issues. It’s 
that so many people have written 
about them that whoever chooses 
to smoke or abuse defenseless crea-
tures probably isn’t going to change 
their behavior based on my column.

I used to think that vaccinations 

fell into this issue category. I assumed 
that most people understood the ben-
efits of vaccinations and the key role 
they play in keeping both individuals 
and the public healthy. This week-
end, I realized I was wrong.

On Friday, I got a flu shot. To me, 

it seemed normal and routine. The 
shot was almost painless, paid for 
entirely by my insurance and took 
less than a half hour out of my day. 
So I was taken aback when a group 
of my friends reacted with surprise 
after mentioning that I had got-
ten the flu shot. None of them had 
gotten it this year. Some thought 
themselves too busy. One remarked 
that she hadn’t gotten the flu shot 
because she “didn’t want autism.”

In 1998, a British doctor released 

a study of only 12 subjects that 
claimed a link between autism and 
the measles, mumps and rubella 
vaccine. The study was widely 
circulated before an investiga-
tion found that the data had been 

manipulated to support the find-
ings. The study was retracted, and 
the researcher was stripped of his 
medical license for “professional 
misconduct.” Several studies since 
have found no link between autism 
and vaccines.

Yet the myth linking autism and 

vaccinations has self-perpetuat-
ed, fueled by fear and anecdotes 
pushed by both parents and public 
figures like Donald Trump, who 
argued in a presidential debate 
that his employee’s child developed 
autism after being vaccinated. 

Last year, some Michigan public 

schools were forced to temporar-
ily close amid measles outbreaks. 
We haven’t seen major outbreaks of 
measles on campus. But, every year, 
we see cases of the flu. Part of that 
might be attributable to the fact 
that the flu vaccine doesn’t protect 
against all strains of the flu, and so 
isn’t completely protective (though, 
in many cases where the flu vaccine 
doesn’t prevent the flu, it still less-
ens the severity of illness.) A larger 
factor, though, lies in the fact that 
most college students don’t get vac-
cinated against the flu at all.

Nationally, only about 8 percent 

of college students receive the flu 
vaccine. Despite the fact that ill-
nesses spread easily on college 
campuses, students routinely fail to 
make the flu shot a priority. Worse 
still, the University doesn’t do 
much to highlight the issue.

The flu shot is available at the 

University Health Service, but UHS 
doesn’t do enough to promote the 
flu shot, or make it acceptable to 
students who don’t have private 
health insurance. Most students 
pay a mandatory “Student Health 
Fee” as part of their tuition. It cov-
ers many UHS services, but doesn’t 
include vaccinations. Though vac-
cinations are covered by all private 
insurance, uninsured students who 

wish to get a flu shot at UHS are 
charged $49 by appointment or $25 
at a flu shot clinic.

UHS’ current campaign to pro-

mote vaccinations — the Campus 
Flu Vaccination Challenge, a com-
petition with Michigan State — is 
actually part of a statewide push 
sponsored by the Michigan Depart-
ment of Health and Human Ser-
vices. Did you know that it took 
place last year, too? Neither did I. 
The contest is severely underpub-
licized and lacks general public 
awareness about its existence. UHS 
also offers flu shot clinics spread 
across Central Campus — some-
thing, as a junior, I just learned on 
Sunday. Better publicizing existing 
programming could help more stu-
dents benefit from it. 

Additionally, UHS should work 

harder to educate students on the 
benefits of getting a flu shot. Discus-
sion of the myths surrounding vac-
cines, including the flu shot, often 
overpowers discussion of its benefits. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, getting the 
flu shot is the best way to avoid get-
ting the flu. And, when students are 
immunized against the virus, it is 
less likely that other students will 
contract the illness.

Some health care issues are a mat-

ter of personal responsibility. Get-
ting vaccinated isn’t one of them. 
It benefits and protects the entire 
community. The University has a 
responsibility to keep our campus 
community healthy this flu season. 
At a minimum, that will require a 
more forceful effort to make students 
aware of the services it already offers. 
In addition, new, creative solutions 
are needed to boost campus flu vac-
cination rates and counter harmful 
myths surrounding the shot.

S

ince 2014, the University has been a subject of an ongoing 
investigation by the Department of Education for its handling 
of sexual misconduct cases. In April, a Michigan Daily report 

on the sexual misconduct policy identified significant flaws in both 
investigative practices and discrepancies in the definition of consent 
between official policy and what the Sexual Assault and Prevention 
Awareness Center teaches. In response, the Daily wrote an editorial 
calling for the University to revise its policy to maintain the University’s 
“sincerity in combating sexual assault on campus.”

Policy in the round

Students should attend discussions on sexual misconduct policy

This desperately needed change may be 

implemented soon, albeit after an opportu-
nity to hear from student voices. On Oct. 1, in 
an e-mail to students, E. Royster Harper, the 
University’s vice president for student life, 
announced a series of roundtable discussions 
and an online survey to address revisions to 
the University’s Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy. While the administration has “devoted 
significant time and expertise in crafting these 
draft revisions,” Harper wrote, “our efforts are 
incomplete without your thoughtful review and 
feedback.” For our safety, all students must be 
involved in this process. Apathy is not an option.

Over the next three weeks, University 

administration will be hosting several round-
tables in tandem with other organizations like 
the Spectrum Center, Trotter Multicultural 
Center, Office of Greek Life, Central Student 
Government and Culture Shift. By partner-
ing with these organizations, it appears the 
administration is hoping to target demograph-
ics of students who are disproportionately 
affected by sexual misconduct on campus, in 
addition to the student body at large. LGBTQ, 
Greek life and underrepresented minority stu-
dents were all at least two times more likely to 
have experienced unwanted or nonconsensual 
penetration, according to the University’s 2015 
campus climate study regarding sexual mis-
conduct. It is encouraging that the University 
feels inclined to address sexual misconduct 
on campus in a manner that recognizes the 
complexities of the issue; each demographic 
on campus has different needs and brings a 
unique perspective. Now, the administration 
must make a concerted effort to truly listen, 
and students must make an equal effort to 
voice their concerns, whether that’s by attend-
ing these roundtable discussions or filling out 
the online survey.

The problem with how the University orga-

nized these roundtables, though, is that there 
is no explanation of what has exactly changed 
in the sexual misconduct policy. Harper’s 
e-mail only provides a link to a draft policy 
that lacks highlights or comments that point 
to the revisions made by the administration. 
At best, this was an unfortunate oversight by 
whoever created the page for this draft. At 
worst, this whole effort to include students 
appears to be an empty gesture if students, 
who are likely (and understandably) not well-

versed in University policy, don’t know what 
they should be looking for.

The most notable change in the drafted 

policy, which is slated to take effect in Janu-
ary 2016, is an expansion on the definition of 
consent. Additional bullet points clarify that 
consent cannot be inferred from silence or pas-
sivity, or from existing or prior relationships. 
Consenting to a singular sexual activity does 
not mean consent to other activities or the same 
activity later on, and consenting to sexual activ-
ity with one person does not mean consent to 
activity with another person.

Furthermore, if the revisions are insti-

tuted, the investigation process will allow 
students to appeal investigation findings to 
a separate and impartial external reviewer, 
most likely an attorney. In the current policy, 
students can appeal investigation findings, 
but only to the same board that decides the 
initial sanctions a student will face.

Other changes include that the University 

will identify all witnesses by name in reports, 
replace the role of resolution officer — who, 
according to the Daily, “previously resolved 
appeals to sanctions or resolutions handed 
down by the resolution coordinator” — with 
an appeals board and explicitly state which 
instances would use the sexual history of 
either party in the investigation. Though 
complicated and requiring an understand-
ing of the investigative process to grasp their 
significance, these are critical changes that 
ideally will ensure greater equity in the pro-
cess by removing previous biases and change 
decision-making from a sole individual.

While all of us hope to never be involved 

in a sexual misconduct investigation, the 
importance of having a sound, equitable and 
trustworthy policy is imperative to the safety 
and comfort of students on campus. The Uni-
versity should have taken better efforts to 
ensure all students have the opportunity to 
understand the revised policy, and there is 
still time. In the meantime, students should 
take it upon themselves to educate each other 
on the implications of these revisions. That 
way, students can attend these roundtables or 
fill out the online survey prepared to provide 
the administration the constructive feedback 
they need — making involving students in 
this drafting process more than a meaning-
less exercise.

GENDER AND MEDIA COLUMN

Beauty, the beast

R

aise your hand if you’ve 
heard of Vibe Credit 
Union.

No? Me neither, until I sat 

down to watch Amy Schumer’s 
“Saturday 
Night Live” 
monologue, 
and was 
treated with 
a lovely Vibe 
commercial. 
It features 
a woman as 
she applies 
make-up 
with bomb-
disabling 
concentration. Her presumed 
boyfriend stands behind her, tak-
ing pictures and complimenting 
her as she preens. Suddenly, we 
discover that he was never taking 
pictures of her — he was using 
Vibe’s convenient mobile banking 
app to deposit his checks online! 
Our intrepid makeup-applying 
protagonist pouts, until he looks 
up and comments in shock at how 
good she looks. Malibu Barbie 
giggles, and says, “Finally.”

***
“You are beautiful.”
The words I slur at my friend as 

she cries about a boy, post-Rick’s. 
The phrase my grandma coos 
over the phone, unprompted and 
unnecessary. The sentence that 
crosses my mind unbidden when I 
watch television, or look at women 
across the street or walk into my 
own goddamn house. As a woman, 
I am constantly confronted with 
the idea of beauty. Not its rela-
tive definition — we all know the 
beauty ideal exists, and that it’s a 
problem — but its crushing impor-
tance. 

Even as I sat down to watch 

Amy’s monologue — which skew-
ers the Kardashians for “taking 
the faces they were born with as 
a light suggestion” and compares 
her own body to a lava lamp — a 
poorly lit commercial from a 
third-rate credit union reminded 
me, yet again, that above all else, I 
am supposed to care about looking 
beautiful all the time.

***
In the ’60s and ’70s, Helen 

Gurley Brown was one of the most 
critical harbingers of second-
wave feminism. The writer of 
the groundbreaking “Sex and 
the Single Girl” (a direct influ-
ence on “Sex and the City”), 
and the first editor of Cosmo-
politan magazine, she was vital 
in introducing female sexuality 
into the buttoned-up zeitgeist. 
She transformed Cosmo from a 
literary magazine edited by men 
into a guidebook for the modern 
single career-oriented woman. 

She spoke candidly about sex and 
status. She was a revolutionary in 
every way.

But Helen had at least one fatal 

flaw. Though she once wrote, 
“Beauty can’t amuse you, but 
brainwork — reading, writing, 
thinking — can,” she was also 
prone to telling women that they 
should never eat more than 1,000 
calories a day, and that, “If you’re 
not a sex object, you’re in trouble.” 

This, coming from one of the 

most valued white feminist voices 
of her time. Even in the context 
of feminism, female beauty has 
always been a sticking point, 
perhaps because beauty gets 
caught in the murky in-between 
of self-esteem activism and sexual 
liberation. Perhaps because even 
the most progressive of feminists 
(myself heartily included) fall 
prey to the strictures created by a 
beauty-obsessed society.

Even Mindy Kaling, creator, 

writer and star of the first sitcom 
starring an Indian-American 
woman on primetime and author 
of two bestselling books, felt the 
necessity to spend multiple chap-
ters of her memoir “Why Not Me” 
discussing the way she looks. This 
is not to blame Mindy — she works 
in an industry where she is valued 
for her looks above all else, and 
because she doesn’t fit the Holly-
wood mold she must constantly be 
proving herself. Her chapters on 
both her own insecurities and her 
hilarious portrayal of self-care as 
a celebrity were honest and relat-
able. But as a purveyor of many 
a celeb memoir, I can attest that 
no man who I’ve read has felt the 
need to write about his looks. And 
every woman I’ve read has.

***
Legend has it that Connie 

Britton flips her hair and a small 
woodland fairy comes into being. 
So when a friend sent me a video 
touting that it revealed Connie’s 
beauty secret, I was all ears. Her 
great beauty secret: feminism. 
Connie explains the many ways 
in which feminism has helped 
women, from the passing of Roe v. 
Wade to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair 
Wage Act, to the non-profits that 
work to fight domestic violence. 
As I watched it again and again, 
thrilled that my two favorite 
things were together in one three-
minute clip, I kept getting stuck 
on my initial reaction. Part of me 
still wanted to know Connie’s 
beauty secret. I hated myself for 
it. Why is the need to be beautiful 
oftentimes the one patriarchal 
ideal that feminists can’t quit? 
Why do we still live in a world in 
which a woman is valued for her 
looks above all else, and even the 
women who should be fighting 

that fall into its trap?

***
To the shock of most people 

who know me, I spent my summer 
working at a beauty company. I 
saw firsthand the time and money 
that goes into helping women 
reach for an unattainable level of 
perfection. I was told — by friends 
I respected and cared about — 
that I should wear more makeup 
or that my hair would look great 
with highlights. I tried to engage 
in discussions of Caitlyn Jenner’s 
transition and instead we talked 
about how hot she looked on the 
cover of Vanity Fair. To be woman 
is to be beautiful.

I told myself it was empow-

ering — self-care engenders 
confidence, which develops self-
esteem, which all women should 
have. But I never really believed 
it. Because it’s not just a problem 
in Hollywood, or in the fast-paced 
New York beauty industry. I sit 
with my roommates as we talk 
about wanting to lose weight, as 
we compare two women’s rela-
tive attractiveness — “You are so 
much hotter than her; he would 
be lucky to hook up with you!” — 
as we choose the perfect lipstick 
that will fade after two minutes 
anyways.

As an editor for The Michigan 

Daily, I have been privileged to 
edit stunning personal essays 
from a diverse range of people 
— on love, loss, insecurities or 
moments of pride. As I look back 
on the stories I have edited — so 
many, too many — of women’s 
deepest personal stories have 
revolved around the way they 
look. Mine included.

I offer no solution. Even as I rail 

against the omniscient pressure to 
be beautiful, even as I yell in exas-
peration at the men in my life who 
have never given this a second 
thought, I’m a part of it. I want to 
feel beautiful. I want to be beauti-
ful. I could list off all of the other 
great qualities I believe I possess, 
but beauty is that great albatross 
I can never get rid of. It’s the one 
unifying goal. It’s the assumption 
that’s made if you are a woman in 
our world: You are woman, there-
fore you must ache to be beauti-
ful. I guess the only thing I can 
do — so small, so insignificant — is 
to stop talking about it. That’s my 
pledge, that from here on out, in 
every column I write, I will never 
discuss the way a woman looks. 
Not even to call her beautiful. I 
know it won’t make a difference, 
but it might make me feel just a 
little bit better.

FILM REVIEW
No happy endings to 
be found in ‘Sicario’

Ruthless thriller 
explores war on 

drugs

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Everything about “Sicario” 

is ruthless. The Mexican cartel 
bosses are ruthless, storing doz-
ens of corpses 
in their houses 
and 
setting 

traps to blow 
up unsuspect-
ing FBI agents. 
Those 
same 

FBI 
agents 

are 
ruthless, 

killing 
indis-

criminately to 
eliminate 
any 

possible threat. And the film 
itself, directed by Denis Ville-
neuve (“Prisoners”), is ruthless, 
providing no happy endings or 
easy solutions to the ongoing 
threat of the Mexican drug car-
tels.

After a rigged shed behind 

an Arizona drug house kills 
two agents, a team of special 
agents is selected to hunt down 
the men responsible. Emily 
Blunt (“Edge of Tomorrow”) 
stars as Kate Macer, an FBI 
agent selected by Matt Graver 
(Josh Brolin, “Inherent Vice”) 
to join the team. Along the way 
to their first mission in El Paso, 
Kate meets Alejandro Gillick 
(Benicio del Toro, “Traffic”), a 
trained killer who remains stoic 
yet kind to Kate.

When they land in Juárez, 

Mexico, however, Kate realizes 
how unprepared she is for this 
elite position. In Mexico, the 
laws normal law enforcement 
agents must abide by no longer 
exist. Merciless killing is toler-
ated, with little concern for col-
lateral damage. Naked corpses 
hang from overpasses, and one 
night, Kate watches through 
binoculars as explosions and 
gunshots are heard all across 
the city. Most of “Sicario” maps 
Kate’s slow realization that she 
must either adapt to her new 
surroundings or die.

That character arc can be 

described in simple terms, but 
it’s harder to convey exactly 
how tense the film is. One of 
the first Juárez scenes is pos-
sibly the tensest in the movie, 
showing a gun battle during a 
traffic jam at the Bridge of the 
Americas. Countless innocent 
bystanders watch in terror, 
treated as non-factors in the 
ongoing war between the car-
tels and the agents who seek 
some twisted form of justice.

The thrills of “Sicario” aren’t 

earned 
exclusively 
through 

conventional means, like tense 
music or kinetic editing (though 
both 
Jóhann 
Jóhannsson’s 

score and Joe Walker’s editing 
complement the tone perfectly). 
Much of the tension is earned 
through wondering how far the 
supposed “good guys” will go 
to take down the cartel. Alejan-
dro is a particularly compelling 
character; though he seems like 
a “dangerous rogue with a heart 
of gold” at the beginning, his 
true nature is only revealed at 
the conclusion of the film.

The early thrills and unravel-

ing secrets of “Sicario” may lead 
some viewers to believe that the 
movie will build to a stunningly 
intense climax, but the climax 
relies more on muted horror 
than 
conventional 
suspense. 

The film’s daring to upend 
expectations is also, in a way, its 
only flaw — Kate, the protago-
nist, is notably absent during 
the sequence the film has built 
toward.

Still, for thematic coherence, 

the resolution is perfect. The 
whole film is populated with 
compelling characters whose 
backstories inform their arcs 
without defining them. Emily 
Blunt is fantastic as a woman 
forced to adapt to this horrify-
ing new world, and Benicio del 
Toro is admirably restrained, 
leaving the viewer to guess his 
true motivations. Brolin is also 
fascinating as a sardonic, bor-
derline sadistic agent who has 
long since found his place in 
this world. As Alejandro tor-
tures the information out of 
prisoners, Matt grins chilling-
ly. In some ways, he’s the rare 
comic relief figure of the film, 
cracking jokes and sneering 
everywhere. But in most ways, 
Matt is just another product of 
the disturbing society shaped 
by the Mexican drug trade.

“Sicario” is a thriller, a char-

acter study and an indictment 
of a section of society so fre-
quently exploited for suspense-
ful action films. Though the 
film does provide those same 
thrills in spades, it’s so impact-
ful because it’s willing to go 
deeper, to be realistic about 
the impossibility of ending this 
sickening system. Kate Macer 
isn’t a badass female action star 
sent in to prove her male col-
leagues’ preconceptions wrong 
and singlehandedly dismantle 
a criminal empire. She’s one of 
the countless lives devastated 
by a system in which the best 
possible outcome is some sem-

ALBUM REVIEW
Selena Gomez’s weak 
and corny ‘Revival’

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

For The Daily

As I lay in bed eating animal 

crackers on this lovely gray day, 
I find myself developing a slight 
migraine 
listening 
to 
Selena 

Gomez’s latest 
album, Reviv-
al. 
Though 

Gomez 
pro-

claimed 
this 

album as her 
music revival, 
she falls noth-
ing but short of 
her intentions.

Gomez, 
who 
recently 

revealed that she underwent 
chemotherapy to combat her 
Lupus diagnosis, has had a 
tumultuous few years. Between 
her illness and notorious rocky 
relationship with Justin Bieber, 
Gomez has been put through 
the wringer. In 2014, she spent 
time 
in 
rehab, 
underwent 

chemotherapy, 
experienced 

heartbreak 
after 
heartbreak 

with Bieber and delivered an 
emotional performance of “The 
Heart Wants What It Wants” 
at the 2014 American Music 
Awards. Her 11-track album, 

Revival, seems to be her way of 
saying, “I’m OK now; I’m getting 
better,” but the real message I 
took away was, “Play this album 
at all Bar Mitzvah parties for the 
next five years.”

Predominantly produced by 

Rock Mafia and Hit Boy, Gomez 
only partially contributed to the 
writing of six out of the 11 songs 
on the album. For an artist to say 
this album is her fresh start and 
revival and not even call the songs 
her own is a bit disappointing. 
Sure, there are a few songs that 
are catchy for 30 seconds, but 
halfway through the song you 
can’t help but want to hit “next.” 
Occasionally, Gomez will belt out 
lyrics with a rich tone, but more 
often than not, the only vocals she 
provides for each song are weak 
and strained ones. 

For instance, in “Same Old 

Love,” 
Gomez’s 
potentially 

solid voice is destroyed by the 
song’s annoyingly repetitive and 
mundane lyrics. The only lyrics 
she seemed to sing for three and 
a half minutes were “Same old 
love, same old love, same old 
love.” We get it Selena, same old 
love. Another song gone wrong is 
“Me & The Rhythm.” Obviously, 
I couldn’t help but dance around 
my dorm room while listening to 

this song; it’s undoubtedly catchy 
and true to its name. The rhythm 
is great, but the lyrics are poorly 
written and the vocals simply 
disappear into the background of 
the strong beats and instrumentals. 
On a more positive note, the best 
song that challenges the overall 
over-produced feel of Revival is 
“Camouflage”; 
stripped 
down, 

the track forgoes the unnecessary 
electronic-pop overtones, proving 
the most genuine and natural 
song, elements that an album with 
a title such as Revival should have 
explored further. 

At the end of the day, the central 

problem in Revival is the lack of 
organic material. Every song on 
the album sounds the same and 
lacks the emotion that should be 
present if this is actually supposed 
to be a revival. Gomez has been 
relatively transparent about her 
struggles over the past few years, 
so for her to suggest that this 
album is her big breakthrough is a 
bit misleading considering there is 
not a single song that is truly honest 
and her own. Every song has the 
potential to be decent, but the 
heavy electronic beats combined 
with corny lyrics and weak vocals 
make the album nothing more 
than an annoying and otherwise 
ephemeral piece of art.

Though it wouldn’t have been 
Schumer without references to 
buttholes or birth control, her 
opening monologue featured 
her take on female role models 
and women in Hollywood.

Specifically, she emphasized 

the need for more female role 
models, poking fun at the 
Kardashians: “Is that a great 
message for little girls for a 
whole family of women who 
take the faces they were born 
with as a light suggestion?” 
In 
contrast, 
Schumer 
self-

deprecatingly referenced her 
own body image, “I have an 
18-month-old niece and we 
have the exact same body,” 
after lightly joking that Khloe 
Kardashian “lost half her body 
weight ... she lost a Kendall.” 
Though disparaging her own 
body image took on a playful 

form and is one of the reasons 
so many women can relate to 
her, her attitude may have the 
opposite of its intended effect. 
Compared to many of “SNL” ’s 
scripted opening monologues, 
in which far less talented hosts 
have poked fun at themselves, 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
she 

ridiculed herself stood out 
as refreshingly sincere and 
authentic.

And 
naturally, 
Schumer’s 

monologue 
included 
an 

anecdote about her favorite 
presidential candidate, Hillary 
Clinton. After asking Clinton 
what her favorite drink was, 
Schumer 
wasn’t 
satisfied 

with Clinton’s response and 
pushed further, asking Clinton 
if she drank tequila. Clinton 
responded 
that 
she 
only 

drinks it when her friends 
make her. Schumer, amused 
by this response, says in her 
monologue “Make you? Like, 
who’s hazing Hillary Clinton?” 
Who else but Schumer would 
discuss alcohol with a former 
first lady, secretary of state and 
presidential 
candidate 
then 

joke about it on live television?

“SNL,” which has in recent 

years become somewhat stale, 
especially after losing many of 
its big-name comedians, was 
reinvigorated 
by 
Schumer’s 

brazenness 
in 
this 
past 

episode. 
The 
outstanding 

ease 
with 
which 
Schumer 

portrayed 
her 
various 

roles, including a hysterical 
Delta flight attendant and a 
seductive school teacher, was 
quite entertaining to watch. 
However, the comedic and 
acting experience she brought 
were limited by a rotation of 

female characters that were 
either ditzy, slutty or hysterical. 
For someone as fearless as 
Schumer, the bounded range 
she was given to work with was 
somewhat disappointing.

The episode, however, did 

seem to be on the right track 
with one thing: gun control. It 
only makes sense that Schumer, 
who has recently advocated 
for 
stricter 
gun-control 

legislation, hosted the episode 
that ran rampant with parodies, 
sketches and jokes regarding 
the national issue. In a satirical 
parody of a public service 
announcement, guns are shown 
as a part of everyday life; 
Schumer, gun in hand, cuddles 
her boyfriend in bed, and a 
father (Bobby Moynihan) hands 
his newborn baby a gun. The 
parody ends with the caption, 
“Guns. We’re here to stay.” Just 
like Schumer’s often obscene 
humor, the message of the mock 
PSA was hardly concealed.

Other highlights of the show 

included the topics of Justin 
Bieber’s recently leaked nude 
photo and filling the position 
of Speaker of the House — 
between which Colin Jost, host 
of “SNL” ’s Weekend Update, 
managed to draw a hilarious 
comparison: “Basically it was 
no one’s first choice. Which 
made me think, ‘Wait, maybe 
Justin Bieber’s penis should 
be the new Speaker of the 
House.’ ” For the first time, 
Jost 
and 
Weekend 
Update 

co-host, Michael Che, were 
on a roll. With hosts such as 
Miley Cyrus, this week’s Amy 
Schumer and next week’s Tracy 
Morgan, “SNL” is starting to 
gain momentum again.

CONCERT REVIEW
Last night I fell in
love with two Brits

Jamie N Commons 
and Catfish & The 
Bottlemen play St. 

Andrew’s

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

For The Daily

On Oct. 11, 2015, I fell in love 

with two British musicians at 
Saint Andrew’s Hall. I didn’t 
think it was possible — to be hon-
est, polygamy really isn’t my thing 
— but when Brits woo you with 
their musical talents, it’s hard to 
resist.

The night began with Jamie 

N Commons, a British blues rock 
and folk musician. Commons was 
born in England, but lived in Chi-
cago during his formative years, 
so his music is heavily influenced 
by the American blues, folk and 
swamp rock music; his unique 
blend of blues and rock sounds 
great recorded, but live is some-
thing else. I knew once he walked 
on stage in a poncho that his per-
formance would be one to remem-
ber, but once he opened his mouth 
the poncho became irrelevant. 
There are only a handful of live 
performances that bring me to my 
knees, and this was one of them. 

Commons 
began 
with 
an 

acoustic solo performance before 
the rest of his four-piece band 
joined him on stage. Between 
his cover of Pink Floyd’s “Wish 
You Were Here” and his bluesy 
rock euphoric originals, Com-
mons nailed it all. Each song he 
performed was unique, beautiful 

and made my heart melt. When 
Commons opens his mouth, a 
flood of rich, luscious and haunt-
ing baritone vocals escape from 
his body. Every word that he sings 
wraps around you. Each drum 
beat moves you and every pluck 
of the guitar reverberates through 
your body. Commons’s live per-
formance can be felt and inter-
nalized in a way that his recorded 
music cannot. That’s not to say 
that his recorded music isn’t good, 
because it is, but there is some-
thing about live music that can’t 
be replicated digitally. 

Similar to Nick Cave and 

George Ezra, Commons’s voice is 
distinctly deep and full of raspy 
and sultry undertones; he’s the 
kind of vocalist who you never 
want to stop singing which is 
why I was disappointed when his 
seemingly short set ended. Luck-
ily, there was a quick turnaround 
before Catfish & The Bottlemen 
took the stage.

After being awed by one of 

the most unique talents of 2015, 
my expectations for Catfish & 
The Bottlemen were high. The 
mom standing in front of me 

clearly was excited for the head-
lining band because she nearly 
took my eye out when Catfish 
appeared on stage to the sound 
of a roaring crowd. I, too, was 
excited to see this young British 
four-piece band take the stage, 
but clearly their dedicated fan-
base of screaming girls and the 
occasional mother were far more 
eager than me to get their hands 
on them. 

Though Catfish & The Bottle-

men performed well live, most 
of their indie rock music blended 
together. Their most well-known 
songs — like “Homesick,” “26” 
and “Kathleen” — were stand-
outs during their set, but the rest 
of their performance was mainly 
interesting due to the crowd’s 
enthusiasm and the band’s relish 
of that enthusiasm.

Unlike Jamie N Commons, 

Catfish & The Bottlemen sound 
slightly better recorded. Ryan 
McCann’s voice isn’t as strong 
as Commons’s, so comparatively 
the performance felt weaker. 
 

Had there been an alternative 
opener, I would probably say that 
Catfish & The Bottlemen nailed 
the performance, but Jamie N 
Commons is a hard act to follow. 

At the end of the day, Catfish 

& The Bottlemen was a pleasant 
band to hear live and are no doubt 
talented. They have the indie 
rock vibe down to a science and 
undoubtedly can bring a crowd 
to tears, but the true winner of 
my heart was Jamie N Commons, 
because it’s only once in a blue 
moon that a poncho-wearing tal-
ented baritone Brit comes along.

TV REVIEW
‘Home Fires’ sizzles

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Stories 
of 
wartime 
are 

romanticized 
in 
ways 
that 

aren’t always obvious to any-
one 
who 

didn’t 
serve 

on the front 
lines. 
This 

goes for sto-
ries about life 
on the home-
front, too. But 
while 
PBS’s 

new “Master-
piece” series 
about 
Brit-

ish 
citizens 

on the brink of World War II, 
“Home Fires,” has its fair share 
of soaring violin music and 
sweet tableaus, it surprisingly 
delves deeper into a well of sto-
ries that, despite having been 
told before, feel revitalized.

“Home Fires” follows the 

lives of British women living 
in a more isolated rural area of 
England on the brink of World 
War II. The pilot opens with an 
argument: Some women believe 
that until the war is over, the 
Women’s Institute, a volunteer 
organization, should stand by 
and wait to reopen after peace 
is restored. Others believe that 
they have a duty to help. One 
woman calls for a vote of no 
confidence in the president, 
who then immediately resigns. 
A few loyal supporters follow 
her out the door — but enough 
remain to keep the doors of the 
Institute temporarily open.

Typical war dramas involve 

husbands, fathers and sons 
enlisting and leaving weepy, 
worried wives and mothers — 
but that isn’t what this story 
focuses on. It focuses on those 
women who aren’t defined just 
by their relationships to men. 
They have their own community 
and ways of contributing to 
the war effort, and their own 

struggles, too. They are just as 
strong and just as vulnerable 
as the men are, but they must 
try twice as hard to have their 
efforts at aiding the country be 
validated.

It’s difficult for a show 

centered around women to avoid 
portraying them as catty or 
one-dimensional when they are 
in competition with each other, 
but “Home Fires” avoids this 
pitfall. It realistically depicts 
the tensions that grew out of 
class differences; for example, 
several of the supporters of the 
Institute’s old president turn 
their noses up at women who 
live on farms and don’t wear 
pearls to meetings.

It helps that the cast is well 

prepared 
and 
comfortable 

in their rapport, with actors 
such 
as 
Samantha 
Bond 

(“Downton 
Abbey”), 
Daisy 

Badger (“Shelter”) and Claire 
Rushbrook 
(“My 
Mad 
Fat 

Diary”) 
inhabiting 
their 

characters with a confidence 
that 
makes 
for 
believable 

interactions.

Though it is a relatively cozy 

show — calming color schemes 
and 
perfectly 
coiffed 
hair 

included — it doesn’t shy away 
from the darker aspects of this 

time period. One of the women 
wants to join the workforce, 
knowing that her family is tight 
on money, but her husband sees 
no reason for her to do so. She 
serves him breakfast after he 
tells her that they aren’t having 
that discussion again, and when 
he notices she isn’t eating, she 
quietly tells him there was only 
enough for one. He smashes 
everything off the table and 
tells her she is welcome to it — 
if she gets it on her hands and 
knees. When a mother asks a 
doctor to fabricate a note for 
chronic asthma for her son so 
he can’t be drafted, the doctor 
grimly informs his secretary 
that she won’t be the last parent 
to do so.

Yes, this is a show in which 

making jam serves as a patriotic 
call to action and a sign of 
hope, but it is also a show that 
won’t shy completely away from 
portraying the time period’s 
desperation in a way we’d 
sometimes 
rather 
not 
face. 

“Home Fires” doesn’t just fill a 
void for period dramas, a genre 
with a pretty niche audience; 
it handles its subject matter 
with sensitivity and dexterity, 
making 
for 
genuinely 
fun 

viewing.

TV REVIEW
‘Once Upon a Time’ 
a promising premiere

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR

Daily Arts Writer

“Once Upon a Time” ’s two-

part, season four finale had 
me clinging to the edge of my 
seat. Just as 
we were ready 
for the happy 
ending 
that 

inevitably 
had to follow 
Henry Mills’s 
(Jared 
S. 

Gilmore, 
“Mad 
Men”) 

decision 
to 

break 
the 

author’s 
pen in half, 
Emma 
Swan 

(Jennifer 
Morrison, 
“House 

M.D.”) tethered herself to the 
darkness, saving Regina Mills 
(Lana 
Parrilla, 
“24”) 
from 

being caught in its wrath. After 
facing a season-long struggle 
to understand her place on the 
good-versus-bad 
spectrum, 

Emma, in one split second of 
primetime television, became 
the 
untried 
name 
on 
the 

notorious Dark One’s dagger.

The series that had seemingly 

tried so hard to explore the 
depth between goodness and 
evil has fallen prey to pushing 
characters to find their place 
at either end of the dichotomy. 
In the season five premiere, 
Captain Killian “Hook” Jones 
(Colin 
O’Donoghue, 
“The 

Rite”) attempts to summon 
Emma through the Dark One’s 
dagger, only to realize that 
she’s trapped in another world. 
Later, it becomes clear that 
Emma is yet again trapped in 
the Enchanted Forest with an 
amorphous Dark One trainer, 
of sorts, who has taken on 
the form of Rumplestiltskin 
(Robert Carlyle, “28 Weeks 
Later”). 
As 
she 
struggles 

to 
resist 
magic 
— 
which, 

apparently, is what allows the 
darkness to consume her — 
back in Storybrooke, Regina 
tricks her wicked half-sister 
Zelena 
(yes, 
once 
again) 

into opening a portal to the 
Enchanted Forest that can only 
be harnessed by someone bred 
of more evil. On finding Emma, 
the crew takes off to Camelot 
to find the elusive Merlin, who 
is said to be the only one which 
powers to destroy the powers 
of the Dark One entirely.

Six weeks later, back in 

Storybrooke, 
the 
cast 
is 

transported 
back 
to 
the 

Enchanted 
Forest 
with 
no 

memories 
after 
entering 

Camelot to find Merlin. Emma, 
by this time, is seen to have 
embraced the darkness, and 
swears to take revenge against 
everyone in Storybrooke that 
betrayed her. 

It’s the classic case of been-

there-done-that. We have only 
seen memories being wiped 
from Storybrooke characters 
twice before now, and Regina’s 
dark humor, though often the 
most entertaining part of the 
show (”You know you can 
still deliver a baby without 
a tongue!”), makes the ease 
in which she admits to being 
the 
town’s 
savior 
to 
the 

Camelot empire slightly less 
believable. To keep the show 
afloat, ”Once Upon a Time” 
’s writers will have to prove 
that they are capable of taking 

a set of seasoned characters 
and pitting them against new 
challenges.

Morrison’s 
acting, 
as 

expected, 
is 
consistently 

phenomenal, as her transparent 
struggles have kept a show 
buried in fantasy still rooted 
to segments of reality. Her 
depiction of a villain in the last 
few minutes of the premiere 
comes out, in some ways, 
more naturally than Parrilla’s 
version of the Evil Queen of the 
Enchanted Forest. The writers’ 
decision to foreshadow the 
future, rather than building 
plot through flashbacks, is 
refreshing. There is only so 
much of the Enchanted Forest 
we can see before thinking, “If 
I wanted to see this, I would 
dig out my childhood VHS 
tapes.” If anything, a Camelot-
centered storyline seems to 
have far more intrigue than 
last year’s take on Anna and 
Elsa from “Frozen.”

I’m optimistic. Executive 

producer 
Adam 
Horowitz 

promised, earlier this month 
at 
a 
Comic-Con 
panel, 
a 

flashback to Hook’s childhood 
and upbringing is in the works, 
along with a two-hour, mid-
season finale that will delve 
deeper into the relationship 
between Mulan, from Disney’s 
“Mulan,” and Ruby, from “Red 
Riding Hood.” “Once Upon 
a Time” ’s power, despite its 
shop-worn 
dialogues 
and 

often-childish plotlines, lies 
in 
its 
approachable 
acting 

and believable relationships. 
By bringing the supporting 
characters 
more 
into 
the 

forefront of the show — while 
still driving the development 
of its core cast — “Once Upon 
a Time” might just manage 
to keep alive a plot that has 
managed to keep characters 
which are nearly a century old 
in our literature fresh.

Bonding methods keep Wolverines close

Friendship 

between coaches 
helps Michigan 
cross country

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

Forget the Starbucks pumpkin 

spice latte. The best pumpkin 
créme brulee, pumpkin pie and 
other delicious fall pumpkin 
treats aren’t at Trader Joe’s — 
they’re found at the Michigan 
men’s and women’s cross country 
teams’ October bake-off. 

Every month, all of Michigan’s 

distance runners get together 
to compete in another arena by 
testing their skills in the kitchen. 
The night usually ends with 
everyone laying on the floor — 
completely stuffed — taking a 
vote on who should win. 

And if you haven’t guessed, 

this month the theme is pumpkin.

“The 

competition is 
intense,” said 
the captain for 
the 
women’s 

squad, Devon 
Hoppe. 
“Everyone 
brings another 
level 
of 

competition to 
the 
bake-off. 

Once I tried 
to participate, but it was just 
mediocre. Now I just eat.”

Despite how close the teams 

are today, the fifth-year senior 
has seen a change in the two 
teams’ relationship since she 
became 
a 
Wolverine. 
She 

attributes this to the addition of 
Kevin Sullivan as head coach of 
the men’s team.

Sullivan is now in his second 

season with the Wolverines. 
He is a Michigan alum and is 

the most decorated runner in 
the school’s history. In his first 
season as head coach, he guided 
his team to its highest finish at 
the NCAA Championships in 
more than a decade. 

Perhaps Sullivan’s secret to 

success and his ability to unify 
the two teams is because he 
trained under the same coach as 
women’s coach Mike McGuire, 
who has directed the program 
for 24 years. Both trained under 
the legendary Ron Warhurst. 

“There are certain similarities 

between how (McGuire and I) 
coach,” Sullivan said. “And there 
are things that are different. It’s 
(a) direct result of training under 
the same coach. It’s natural to 
take what you learned from your 
coach and move it to how you 
train your own athletes.

“(McGuire) and I have our 

offices right next to each other, so 
we pop into each other’s offices 
often to talk about training, team 
issues and strategy. We rely on 
each other for advice.”

Yet 
the 

two 
cross 

country teams 
are 
separate. 

They practice 
on 
different 

schedules, they 
often 
travel 

to 
different 

meets and they 
have different 
track records. 
But this season 

seems to be bringing the teams 
closer together.

“I feel like we have we have a 

great relationship,” Hoppe said. 
“We’re a big family, we love 
each other very much, and we 
all recognize that we all want to 
work hard. That’s the core of our 
relationship. We’re all striving to 
achieve the same goals. The men’s 
team is an extra support system.” 

Hoppe’s 
classmate, 
Nick 

Posada, agreed and emphasized 

how effective some of Sullivan’s 
policies have been. 

“The boys and girls used to go 

to separate training camps, but 
when Sullivan came we started 
going to the same camp,” Posada 
said. “This was a new step in the 
relationship. We played board 
games and we just introduced 
ourselves to each other. Now, 
every weekend we’ll get together 
with the other team. There’s 
this whole social life the women 
and men do together now that 
centers around running.

“Sullivan thought it would be 

best if we became one cohesive 

distance unit. He wanted to bring 
back the same atmosphere he had 
when he was at school here.”

An integral part of the melding 

of the teams is their introductions 
at camp. All the runners get 
paired up — 40 women to 26 men 
— and introduce the other to the 
group. This activity helps all the 
athletes get to know everybody’s 
name and small fun facts about 
each one of them. 

According to Posada, this is 

one of McGuire’s favorite team-
building exercises. Otherwise, 
he maintains a serious demeanor 
while coaching. 

“Both programs have been 

traditionally strong programs, 
and McGuire is one of the best 
coaches,” Posada said. “We have 
strong coaches on both sides, 
which is pretty rare. We kind of 
look at (the women’s team) and 
ask how they get that consistency 
because they’re constantly a top-
10 team. That’s what (the men) 
strive for.” 

So far, the the men’s and 

women’s cross country teams 
have been running far ahead 
of the competition this season. 
Coming off of last weekend’s 
domination 
at 
the 
Greater 

Louisville Classic, both fifth-
year senior Mason Ferlic and 
junior Erin Finn were named 
Big-Ten Cross Country Athletes 
of the Week. Yet the men and 
women are still debating over 
who really is running “on time.” 

“The 
girls 
are 
overly 

punctual,” Ferlic said. “The guys 
are on time. According to them, 
if you’re not half an hour early, 
you’re late.”

“If you’re not three minutes 

early, you’re late,” Finn said. 
“But the boys are not that way. 
We spend a lot of time waiting

Harbaugh downplays rivalry

By MAX COHEN 

Managing Sports Editor

Everything 
about 
Jim 

Harbaugh conveyed a sense of 
normalcy Monday.

He entered his weekly press 

conference wearing his near-
constant outfit of khakis, a block 
‘M’ crew neck and a hat with 
the thin block ‘M.’ He answered 
questions no differently than 
he normally does, preferring 
to discuss fullback play than 
whether or not his team’s success 
is ahead of schedule.

His answers provided little 

indication of what looms ahead. 
Saturday’s 
matchup 
against 

No. 7 Michigan State will mark 
the biggest game of the No. 
12 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 

season to date. It will provide an 
opportunity for the Wolverines 
to 
make 
another 
statement 

about their resurgence, a chance 
to assert themselves as the 
preeminent program in the state.

Yet Harbaugh did not seem 

particularly concerned with the 
implications of the game or the 
rivalry.

He 
chose 
not 
to 
explain 

his decision to remove rivalry 
countdown 
clocks 
from 

Schembechler Hall, which had 
been a staple of the Brady Hoke 
regime. Instead, he said that it had 
been a while since the decision 
was made.

At least publicly, Harbaugh 

would not flinch in his stance 
of downplaying the rivalry. His 
reasoning for why the game was 
important 
mentioned 
nothing 

about 
restoring 
Michigan 
to 

prominence or if it’s important for 
his team to unseat the Spartans as 
the best team in the state.

His response would also have 

been fitting for the Wolverines’ 
next game against Minnesota, 
after which the winner is awarded 
a trophy.

“It’s a trophy game, we want 

to get the best grades, we want to 
win the most awards, we want to 
excel at sports,” Harbaugh said. 
“This is a game that has a trophy 
associated to it, so it’s an award.”

This 
summer, 
he 
called 

Michigan State the biggest guys 

on the block. So it was natural 
that before his team played the 
biggest guys on the block, he 
would discuss wanting to knock 
the Spartans off.

That was not the case. The 

former Michigan quarterback, 
who once guaranteed a victory 
over Ohio State, was not prepared 
to make any bold statements this 
time around.

“Winning the next game is 

the goal,” Harbaugh said. “That’s 
the most important thing, there’s 
nothing more important than that, 
where you stand in this week.” 

He did not seem to care much 

about the history of the rivalry, at 
least not on Monday. Harbaugh 
did not seem interested in talking 
about the games he quarterbacked 
against Michigan State or what he 
thought of the way the Spartans 
have 
physically 
dominated 

Michigan in recent years.

Harbaugh twice referenced 

a scene from The Lion King to 
emphasize his point that the past 
does not dictate what happens 
in the present. In it, Simba, the 
main character, is contemplating 
his difficult past, which included 
the death of his father Mufasa, 
the lion king. To prove a point, 
the wise sage monkey Rafiki 
smacks him over the head with 
his staff.

Simba then complains to Rafiki 

that his head hurts. Harbaugh 
applied Rafiki’s response to his 
team’s rivalry game.

“Simba gets hit over the head 

and he tells him, ‘Yeah, the past 
can hurt. You can either run from 
it or embrace it and learn from it.’ 
I think that’s exactly what he said. 
Those seem like very wise words,” 
Harbaugh said.

Harbaugh’s players did not 

deviate from his message. Junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 
Lewis, 

junior tight end Jake Butt, fifth-
year senior linebacker Desmond 
Morgan and fifth-year senior 
fullback 
Joe 
Kerridge 
each 

had the opportunity to provide 
bulletin-board material, to create 
the kind of buzz the in-state 
rivalry has been known for.

Each declined to do so. They 

have felt the pain of losing to 
Michigan State before. Each has 
watched the Spartans carry the 
Paul Bunyan Trophy off the field 
on multiple occasions.

They figure this new coaching 

staff might be on to something, 
their 5-1 record serving as proof.

“I think it’s been working 

so far,” Kerridge said. “Coach 
Harbaugh 
knows 
what 
he’s 

doing.”

Club players join 
team scrimmage

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team 

took the opportunity Friday to 
introduce a few new Wolverines 
to the ice for the first time during 
a rare off-weekend.

Eight 
players 
from 
the 

Michigan 
club 
hockey 
team 

dressed for the Wolverines and 
skated in a scrimmage meant to 
break up the doldrums of day-to-
day practice. Michigan opened 
the season with an exhibition 
against the University of Toronto 
on Oct. 4, but will not play another 
game until Friday. 

With just 25 players, this 

year’s team carries a light roster 
for a Division I hockey program, 
so there was speculation that 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
might try to add another player as 
a safeguard.

“I can’t tell you we’re looking 

for players,” Berenson said. “If 
we ever had a rash of injuries, I 
think there would be a couple 
of them who would be able to 
play. They would be good depth 
players. They held up well, and I 
was glad we got to have a look at 
them.”

Berenson 
said 
that 
the 

Wolverines have only added a 
club player a few as a result of 
injury — once a goalie, another 
time a defenseman.

The 
players 
who 
suited 

up from the club team were 
Matt Schymick, Blake Smith, 
Ben Manksy, Jack Blumberg, 
Jonathan 
Katz, 
Lorenzo 

Bongiovanni, Alex Shell and Kyle 
Slovis. A few of the players held 
their own on both ends of the ice. 
Mansky, a sophomore forward, 
looked particularly impressive, 
battling well in the corners and 
finding the net to beat senior 
goaltender Steve Racine.

Michigan’s 
players 
also 

looked strong despite a lopsided 
victory for the white team. The 
defense continues to look more 
comfortable and quicker last 
year’s unit. There was also some 

development on offense, where 
freshman 
forward 
Brendan 

Warren displayed an uncanny 
ability to find the puck with space 
around the net. 

Warren, who was selected 81st 

overall by the Phoenix Coyotes in 
the 2015 NHL Draft, looked good 
in the season-opening exhibition 
against University of Toronto, but 
has settled in with his line over 
the past week.

“The 
younger 
line 
with 

(freshman 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody) and Brendan Warren 
and (sophomore forward) Tony 
Calderone — I think they are 
going to be a good third line, 
maybe even better than third 
line,” Berenson said. “I really like 
Brendan. He’s not only a good 
skater, he’s strong. You go into the 
corner with him and he’s going 
do everything he can to win that 
battle. He plays with an edge and 
he’s good with the puck and he’s 
got a nose for the net.”

The club players put in strong 

efforts as well, winning a few 
loose pucks and congratulating 
each other after a shot or defensive 
stop. Parents and friends of the 
players sat in the stands, cheering 
when they took the ice.

Bongiovanni is a local-area 

player who faced off against 
Wolverine Zach Werenski, a 
sophomore defender, and Kyle 
Conner, a freshman forward, in 
spring leagues. He said playing 
with that pair Friday brought the 
experience full circle.

“You get to see how they go 

through their routines and that’s 
pretty cool,” Bongiovanni said. “It 
would be great to see club hockey 
players get to do that again in the 
future to keep the connection up.”

The light-hearted scrimmage 

was fun for everyone involved, 
but the casual atmosphere will 
disappear this weekend. When 
the Wolverines takes the ice for 
their first regular-season game 
Friday against Mercyhurst, Yost 
Ice Arena figures to be quite a 
bit louder, and the margin for 
error slimmer.

Defense controls mindset after third shutout

Michigan looks 
to continue its 

momentum against 

Michigan State

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

When 
game 
week 
comes 

to a close, ESPN’s “College 
GameDay” wraps up its show 
Saturday 
morning 
and 
the 

Michigan football team kicks off 
its showdown against Michigan 
State, almost one month will 
have passed since the Wolverines 
last gave up a point.

Fifth-year senior linebacker 

Desmond Morgan smiles at the 
thought. A few days ahead of 

the toughest test of this streak, 
Michigan’s defense isn’t worried 
about its end.

“We just play our game,” 

Morgan said. “We’re not into 
predictions 
— 
what 
if 
this 

happens? What if that? It’s 
all speculation. Our goal is to 
prepare this week as best we 
can to go win a football game on 
Saturday.”

Ah yes, the football game 

on Saturday. Almost all of the 
discussion 
Monday 
centered 

around the game against the 
Spartans, who have won the past 
two meetings by a combined 
score of 64-17.

“Yeah, they beat us,” said 

junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis. “Honestly, it’s a humbling 
experience, but we can’t dwell on 
it.”

The Wolverines have chosen 

to forget those two losses. And 
thanks to the strength of their 
top-ranked defense, they are 
favored to win the rivalry game 
for just the second time in eight 
tries.

And 
if 

there 
was 
a 

concern about 
that 
defense 

letting 
up 

while riding a 
historic streak, 
Michigan put 
that 
to 
rest, 

too.

“(Defensive 

coordinator 
D.J.) 
Durkin 

does a great job of never taking 
his foot off the gas pedal in 
practice, never letting a guy 

slip,” Morgan said. “He’s as 
fiery in meetings now as he was 
three weeks ago before we had a 
shutout. It’s one of those things 
where he’s not going to let up, 
so in turn we’re not going to let 
up.”

Still, 
the 

circumstances 
are 
different 

now from the 
last time the 
Wolverines 
gave 
up 
a 

point Sept. 19 
against UNLV. 
They have not 
trailed 
since 

the 
second 

quarter of the 

Sept. 12 home opener against 
Oregon State.

Depending on how things go, 

that streak could be snapped 
Saturday, forcing Michigan to 
respond. The Wolverines insist 
Durkin will have them ready.

“He’s just as enthused as 

Coach Harbaugh is,” Lewis said. 
“He brings that energy. He brings 
that enthusiasm every day. If 
we don’t have that enthusiasm, 
he lets us know it. We have to 
bring that energy, and if we don’t 
bring that energy, it’s not to his 
standards.”

Michigan vehemently avoided 

hyping up itself or the game 
Saturday, keeping a low profile in 
the Spartans’ eyes.

But the stats do the talking 

for the Wolverines. So do the 
fans, who broke out into a loud 
“DE-FENSE!” chant near the end 
of Saturday’s game.

“I couldn’t even think,” Lewis 

said. “I have never seen anything 
like that. I was just so excited 
that they were behind us. … It 
was a mind-blowing experience.”

With that finished, Michigan’s 

attention turned solely to this 
week. So far, the Wolverines’ 
three straight shutouts have 
vaulted them to the top of the Big 
Ten standings, to No. 12 in the 
Associated Press poll and into 
the national conversation.

But 
another 
shutout 
on 

Saturday might mean more than 
the others.

“It’s a big game, there’s no 

question it’s a rivalry,” Morgan 
said. 
“Taking 
it 
personally? 

Yeah. I’m a kid from the state 
of Michigan. I know what this 
game is. I know how important 
it is. It definitely is something 
that’s personal.”

“He’s just 
as enthused 

as Coach 

Harbaugh is.”
