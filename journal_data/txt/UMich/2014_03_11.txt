SACUA discusses
administrative
issues, member
elections in meeting
By ANDREW ALMANI
Daily StaffReporter
At the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs'
meeting Monday, the faculty
governance body discussed an
array of topics and concluded
with an executive session with
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack.
SACUA members addressed
the proposed awarding of
honorary degrees at Spring

Commencement, appropriate
grievance procedures and an
upcoming meeting with Uni-
versity President-elect Mark
Schlissel. This meeting will be
the first time SACUA has had
the chance to meet with and
engage in direct discussion with
the President-elect.
During the presiden-
tial search process, SACUA
expressed concern that their
input was not solicited to a
greater degree during his selec-
tion. Nonetheless, some mem-
bers expressed approval of the
Board of Regents' Choice when
Schlissel was named in January.
Duringtheir meeting Jan. 24,
Dentistry Prof. Rex Holland,
SACUA vice chair, said he was
optimistic that Schlissell will

serve as an exemplary president.
"I'm very impressed with
President-elect Schlissel's cre-
dentials," Holland said. "His
speech was short but contained
several very positive references
to faculty governance. I have
great confidence that President-
elect Schlissel will be a splendid
leader for a splendid institu-
tion."
The non-executive discus-
sion during the meeting con-
sisted largely of questions about
SACUAs duty to nominate indi-
viduals to the Department of
Public Safety Oversight Com-
mittee. The committee is an
independent group that moni-
tors the DPS and any problems
or complaints that may occur,
advising the University admin-

istration if changes need to be
made.
SACUA is in charge of find-
ing faculty nominees when
positions open on the Oversight
Committee, through a nominat-
ing committee. The nominating
committee will consist of Medi-
cal Prof. Charles Koopmann and
Astronomy Prof. Sally Oey, both
SACUA members, and Holland.
The nominating committee
faces some difficulty in the pro-
curing of nominees, due to tech-
nical problems with the Senate
Assembly's computers. The
server has recently been in use
by other sections of the Senate
Assembly, preventing the nomi-
oating committee from utilizing
it in their search.

State to formally
acknowledge
fibromuscular
dysplasia today
ByAMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
Thirteen years ago, Pam Mace
was diagnosed with fibromuscu-
lat dysplasia, a rarely diagnosed
disease. Today, the disease is
being recognized in a statewide
awareness day.
After a year-long effort by
Mace to garner more public
awareness of the disease, the
Michigan state Legislature has
declared March 11 as Fibromus-
cular Dysplasia Awareness Day.
Experts said awareness is crucial
for the treatment of the disease,
which is commonly misdiag-
nosed due to lack of understand-
ing by medical personnel.
FMD causes abnormal growth
in the medium-sized arteries
in the body, potentially causing
hypertension, strokes and aneu-
rysms. It mostly affects women
in their 30s and 40s. When Mace
first had a small stroke, she
was repeatedly diagnosed with
hypertension, or high blood pres-
sure.
"I just kept getting told that
my blood pressure was high
because of my history with high
blood pressure with both of my
parents," Mace said. "I kept get-
ting told to get on with my life.

No one could tell me what caused
it.",
Unsatisfied with this answer,
Mace kept searching for a cause.
When she was finally diagnosed
with FMD a full year after her
stroke, she said she felt very
alone.
"You're told you have a rare
disease, you go to the doctor,
he says, 'I've never seen a case
before,"' Mace said. "There was
very little literature on the dis-
ease back then."
Faced with the daunting diag-
nosis, Mace began a campaign to
raise awareness. She joined the
Fibromuscular Dysplasia Society
of America in 2004, and she said
she has had many opportunities
to raise awareness since.
"We got the National Stroke
Association to list it, then the
American Stroke Association
listed it," Mace said. "More doc-
tors started diagnosing the dis-
ease, and different opportunities
kept presentingthemselves.",
In 2009, Mace came to the
Michigan Cardiovascular Out-
comes Research and Reporting
Program and asked them to cre-
ate a national clinical registry of
patients with FMD. The registry
now has 14 participating sites
nationally, and tracks nearly 900
patients. MCORRP Manager Eva
Kline-Rogers said the informa-
tion gained from patients has
allowed for some crucial find-
ings.
"What we found in the regis-
try is that 90 percent of patients

The University community

Council elections
allegedly violate
UMEC bylaws
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Judi-
ciary, the highest judicial
authority of Central Student
Government, heard allegations
of irregularities in the Univer-
sity Engineering Council elec-
tions Tuesday night, which
took place in December.
Rackham student Kyle Lady,
the Eta Kappa Nu represen-

tative for UMEC, and Engi-
neering sophomore Kelsey
Hockstad, an officer of Tau
Beta Pi, filed the suit against
UMEC for alleged undemo-
cratic behavior.
The petitioners cited the
timing of the election and
withholding of official results
to the public as some of their
concerns violating basic demo-
cratic principles. The eligibil-
ity of elected officials due to
their constituency within the
University was also called into
question.
Rackham student Chris Ste-
vens, chief justice of the CSJ,
said that an official opinion
may be released by early next
week. The final written verdict

will address in detail all issues
raised during the meeting.
According to Article II of
the - UMEC Bylaws, UMEC
elections should coincide with
Central Student Government
elections in November. This
year, elections did not take
place until December 5 to 6.
According to Article IV, results
should have been released to
the public by Dec. 9. Formal
public results have yet to be
published, and they were only
given to the plaintiffs at the
Jan. 22 UMEC meeting.

LANDSCAPING --

Novelist's work comes to screen

Phoebe Gloeckner is an associ-
ate professor in the School of Art
and Design and a graphic novelist.
Her most recognized work is her
2002 book, "The Diary of a Teen-
age Girl." Gloeckner received the
Guggenheim Fellowship to study
the lives of the family of a teen-
ager who was murdered in Ciudad
Judrez, a city close to the U.S.-
Mexico border. She also teaches
a graphic novel class and an elec-
tronic books class.
Could you discuss the film
adaptation of your novel "The
Diary of Teenage Girl?"
For the last month and a half
I've been going back and forth
between San Francisco and Ann

Arbor to be present on the film
shoot. It's starringKristen Wiig,
Alexander Skarsgard, Christo-
pher Meloni and some relative-
ly unknowns because they're
practically teenagers.
How is it watching your novel
being transformed into a
different medium?
It's insanely weird. Mostly
because my work is - I never
call it straight autobiography at
all, but it's based in my experi-
ence. So these characters are
based on real people, who I've
encountered even, are myself.
The protagonist is based on
me at a certain age. So I think
actually the actress who plays

that character was afraid to
meet me in the beginning. She
was really nervous that she
would be playing it wrong or
that I would judge. But I didn't
of course because if you agree
to have your work turned into
something else, you have to give
control to the director-or else
it just turns into a pile of mush.
What would you say is your
greatest artistic influence?
My favorite movie is "The
Virgin Spring" directed by Ing-
mar Bergman or "Blue Velvet,"
which is an earlier David Lynch.
But I also love Robert Crumb.

Colorado pot taxes amass
over $2 million in revenue

Revenue from pot
industry may go
toward statewide
anti-drug campaign
DENVER (AP) - Colorado
made roughly $2 million in
marijuana taxes in January,
state revenue officials report-
ed Monday in the world's first
accounting of the recreational
pot business.
The tax total reported by the
state Department of Revenue
indicates $14.02 million worth
of recreational pot was sold
from 59 businesses. the state
collected roughly $2.01 million
in taxes.
Colorado legalized pot in
2012, but'the commercial sale
of marijuana didn't begin until
January. Washington state sales
begin in coming months.
The pot taxes come from
12.9 percent sales taxes and 15
H-S

percent excise taxes. Including
licensing fees and taxes from
Colorado's pre-existing medi-
cal marijuana industry, the state
collected about $3.5 million
from the marijuana industry in
January.
That's a relative drop in the
bucket for Colorado's roughly
$20 billion annual budget, but
still a windfall that has numer-
ous interests holding out their
hands. By comparison, Colo-
rado made about $2.7 million in
liquor excise taxes in January
of last year. Statewide liquor
receipts for January 2014 were
not yet available Monday.
Colorado tax officials say
the January marijuana reports
were in line with expectations,
though they repeatedly said
before the figures were report-
ed that they couldn't guess what
tax receipts would be.
Monday's tax release intensi-
fied lobbying over how Colorado
should spend its pot money.
Budget-writers expect the
H-

nascent marijuana industry to
be extremely volatile for several
years, making lawmakers ner-
vous about where to direct the
funds.
Gov. John Hickenlooper
already has sent the Legisla-
ture a detailed $134 million pro-
posal for spending recreational
and medical marijuana money,
including new spending on
anti-drug messaging to kids and
more advertising discouraging
drivitig while high.
State police chiefs have asked
for more moonoey, too.
"The whole world wants to
belly up to this trough," said
Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver
Democrat who serves on Colo-
rado's budget-writing Joint
Budget Committee.
Other countries also are
watching Colorado, which has
the world's first fully regulated
recreational marijuana market.
The Netherlands has legal sales
of pot but does not allow grow-
ing or distribution. Uruguay's
marijuana program is still under
development.
"Colorado's going to help the
nation learn what works and
what doesn't," said Pat Oglesby,
a former congressional tax staff-
zr who now studic ,marijuana's
tax potential at the Chapel Hill,
N.C., Center for New Revenue.
Colorado has about160 state-
licensed recreational marijuana
stores, though local licensing
kept some from opening in Jan-
uary. Only 24 recreational pot
shops opened Jan. 1.
Oglesby said Colorado's pot
sales could grow dramatically
in future months as new stores
open and marijuana sellers pay
more wholesale taxes. Mari-
juana sellers were allowed a
one-time tax-free transfer of
medical pot inventory to the
recreational market, a caveat
that depressed January whole-
sale tax results.
Colorado's pot revenue pic-
ture is further complicated by
the state's unique budget con-
straints, known as the Taxpay-
ers' Bill of Rights.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, and Israel's Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, examine dozens of
mortar shells and rockets seized from the Panama flagged KLOS C civilian cargo ship that Israel intercepted last Wednesday.
Netanyahu draws attention to
seizure of Iranian weaponry

Israeli leader
accuses ran
of perpetuating
Gaza violence
EILAT, Israel (AP) - Israel's
prime minister on Monday tri
umphantly urd ciisplay of
dozaea, of rucketsthat iavy con-
mandos intercepted in the Red
Sea last week, alleged to be on
their way from Iran to the Gaza
Strip, and accused the interna-
tional community of ignoring
Iranian support for militant
groups and falling victim to a
charm offensive by the new lead-
ership in Tehran.
Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to
this Red Sea port capped a six-
day PR blitz aimed at persuading
world powers to toughen their
position in nuclear talks. So far,
the international reaction has
been subdued, illustrating the
uphill battle the Israeli leader
faces in his efforts to change the
minds of world leaders about
Iran's outreach to the West.
"There are those who would
prefer that we not hold this
news conference here today,

they feel uncomfortable that we
show what is really happening
inside Iran," Netanyahu said. He
spoke to a backdrop of the cap-
tured ship and the Israeli vessels
involved in the operation along
with the Israeli defense minister.
"Iran, a brutal regime, has
not abandoned its deep involve-
ment in terrorism, its systematic
efforts to underrmine peace and
,ecurity throughout the Middle
East and its ambition to destroy
the state of Israel," Netanyahu
said. "What is new is not Iran's
deeds or its lies, but the desire of
many in the international com-
munity to bury their heads in the
sand."
The tough comments threat-
ened to further strain Netanya-
hu's already tense relations with
the European Union and the
White House.
State Department spokes-
woman Jen Psaki told reporters
in Washington that the U.S. is
concerned about Iran's support
for militants but that it is still
focused on resolving the nuclear
issue.
"There are remaining con-
cerns we have about their ter-
rorist activities, about - or
activities tied to terrorism,

including the transfer, of course,
of weapons, and - as well as
human rights abuses, and we'll
continue to hold them account-
able," she said.
Israel believes that Iran is try-
ing to build a nuclear weapon,
saying a nuclear-armed Iran
would pose a threat to the exis-
tence of the Jewish state, citing
Iranian calls for Israel's destiuc-
tion, its development of long-
range missiles and its support
for hostile militant groups on
Israel's borders. Iran denies that
it is pursuing weapons technol-
ogy.
Netanyahu has been an out-
spoken critic of the efforts by
six world powers to negotiate a
deal with Iran that would sub-
stantially scale back its nuclear
program in exchange for end-
ing international sanctions. He
says a current, interim deal gives
Iran too much relief while get-
ting little in return, and fears a
final agreement would leave the
Islamic Republic with the capa-
bility to make a bomb.
Since last Wednesday's naval
raid, Netanyahu has done his
utmost to use persuade the world
that the shipment revealed the
"true face" of Iran.

New research
finds elephants
understand people
Dr. Seuss had it right: Horton
really does hear a Who. Wild ele-
phants can distinguish between
human languages, and they can
tell whether a voice comes from a
man, woman or boy, a new study
says.
That's what researchers found
when they played recordings of
people for elephants in Kenya.
Scientists say this is an advanced
thinking skill that other animals
haven't shown. It lets elephants
figure outwho is a threat and who
isn't.
The result shows that while
humans are studying elephants,
the clever animals are also study-

ing people and drawing on their
famed powers of memory, said
study author Karen McComb.

Painted in 1943 for wealthy art

with our membership experience.
Furthermore, we have endured a
painful number of chapter clos-
ings as a result of hazing."
Brandon Weghorst, associate
executive director of communica-
tions for the SAE national orga-
nization, said the penalties for
chapters that continue to practice
pledging or hazing rituals will be
severe. Weghorst said any behav-
ior causing new members to feel
like "second class citizens" will
result in removing individual
members or closing an entire
chapter.
"The reality is we know all the
good things that our members do
everydaythat don'tget attention,"
Weghorst said. "This is one way
to help put us on the path we need
to be on to help prevent some of
those incidents from ever hap-
pening again."
LSA sophomore Brett Mizzi,
president of the University's
chapter of SAE declined to com-
ment on the policy change.
LSAjunior Tommy Wydra, IFC
President did not comment on the
University chapter's chances of
rejoining the officially sanctioned
Greek community, but said they
should easily adapt to the new
national policies.
"I've worked a little bit with
the leaders of SAE and I'm confi-
dent that they will be able to make
a smooth transition," he said.
"They've got some good leaders
over there."

said. "That's where the regis-

contributions, in helping to elu-

Dr. Santhi Ganesh, assistant
professor of human genetics and
internal medicine, has worked
with patients in the clinical reg-
istry and their families to study
the genetics of FMD. She said
there is a genetic component to
the disease.

This knowledge may be used to
develop targeted therapies for

Shannon Fry, who has also
been diagnosed with FMD, is
listed in the clinical registry
and is a patient of Dr. Ganesh.
Like Mace, she was misdiag-
nosed with hypertension before
being diagnosed with FMD. She
said she has been profoundly
affected by Mace's work, and has
been workingto raise awareness
about the disease as well.
"I started visiting the FMDSA

Hartz said. "Certain things I

Fry said. "I became a part of Dr.

Although more and more
patients are being diagnosed,
Mace said the disease is still
considered rare. In her latest
effort to raise awareness, she has
petitioned successfully, with the
help of state Rep. Patrick Somer-
ville (D-District 23), for March
11 to be FMD Awareness Day in
Michigan.
"It started well over a year

Mace said for FMD Aware-

announced outcome of the
elections and served as chair
over the motion to approve the
results. The motion passed 36-6
to approve the newly elected and
appointed representatives.
The results in question are
related to the race for the posi-
tions of president, vice president,
and director of administration.
Rackham student Boying Liu
was seated as president, though
Liu ran for the position of vice
president. Similarly, Engineer-
ing sophomore Selina Thompson
ran for director of administra-
tion yet was seated as vice presi-
dent. Engineering sophomore
Anna Shrestinian did not appear
on the ballot, but was seated as
director of administration.
Liudefended her appointment
as President on the authority of
the General Council. She said
that there was no vocal opposi-
tion to her assuming the role of
UMEC president from any mem-
bers during the January 22 gen-
eral meeting.
Engineering senior Kenneth
Mull, the former vice presi-
dent of UMEC, said in a Jan. 22
e-mail to Lady that Engineering

sophomore Diego Calvo, won the
election but withdrew over win-
ter break.
According to Article III of
the UMEC Constitution, in
the event of a vacated seat, the
Executive Board should appoint
an interim officer to be approved
by a vote of the General Council.
No such motion was made by
UMEC following Calvo's resig-
nation. The alleged vacancy of
the seat is still unclear, as Calvo
was not yet sworn in as president
when he resigned.
Petitioners also argued the
eligibility of both candidates and
voters for the UMEC is also in
contradiction with the All-Cam-
pus Constitution and CSG Com-
piled Code. According to Article
III of the UMEC Constitution,
members of UMEC are defined
as students who are enrolled in
either the College of Engineer-
ing, Computer Science within
LSA or Rackham Engineering
programs.
However, according to the
All-Campus Constitution, stu-
dents of one constituency may
not sit on the body of another
constituency. Each student in
the University pays a $1.50 fee
along with tuition for his or her
respective school's student gov-
ernment. Since UMEC collects
fees exclusively from undergrad-

uates of the College of Engineer-
ing, the petitioners argued that
UMEC should exclude Rackham
and LSA students from elec-
tions.
The petitioners said that as
a Rackham student, Liu should
not be allowed to serve as
UMEC President. Additionally,
Rackham students were among
those who voted on the motion
to approve the election results
at the Jan. 22 meeting. The peti-
tioners argued that this vote
should also be discounted for the
same reason.
The defendant said that
UMEC should not be this exclu-
sive, as currently only roughly
$15,000 of the $24,000 budget
comes from mandatory student
fees. Also, they said the purpose
of studentgovernment should be
to serve respective student com-
munities, even if those constitu-
encies overlap.
Though no official verdict
was reached, each justice shared
individual opinions at the con-
clusion of the hearing. While
the justices overall agreed that
the December UMEC elections
were handled incorrectly, it
is still unclear what the exact
details of the verdict will be. Ste-
vens said the case was extremely
muddled.
Law student Andrew Weis-

berg, UMEC associate justice,
said the election should not be
valid because of the delayed
timeline. LSA senior Brandon
Barlog, UMEC associate justice,
agreed, and repeatedly said the
issue originated with UMEC's
failure to hold elections in
November in accordance with
its bylaws.
LSA senior Lukas Gar-
ske, UMEC associate justice,
and LSA senior Anita Parikh,
administrative justice, both
pointed to the negligence of the
outgoing 2013 UMEC Execu-
tive Board in the outcome of the
election.
Parikh said that the current
officials should not necessar-
ily be punished for the mishan-
dling of the election.
"It was not their fault that the
elections were held so poorly by
the previous board," she said.
However, the justices were
unanimous in that a constitu-
tional convention should be held
inthe near future by both parties
to address the conflicts between
the UMEC Constitution and All-
Campus Constitution.
Stevens said that revisions
to both constitutions are inevi-
table.
"I see this opinion as tempo-
rary no matter what happens,"
he said.

Airline's lack of information angers relatives

Malaysia Airlines
sends officials to
Beijing as search
continues
BEIJING (AP) - The
anguished hours had turned
into a day and a half. Fed up
with awaiting word on the miss-
ing Malaysia Airlines plane,
relatives of passengers in Beijing
lashed out at the carrier with a
handwritten ultimatum and an
impromptu news conference.
Faced with an emergency, the
airline said it was doing all it
could to answer questions about
Flight MH370, which disap-
peared from radar Saturday with
239 people aboard while heading
from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
The uncertainty over the plane's
whereabouts was frustrating
relatives, but also hindering the
carrier's ability to respond: It's
difficult to deliver a clear mes-
sage with so much still unclear.
From a room set aside at a
hotel near the Beijing airport, a
man with a black shirt emerged
with a statementsigned by about
100 of the relatives, saying that
unless the carrier could give
them some clarity, they would
take their complaints to the
Malaysian Embassy.

"We don't believe Malaysia
Airlines anymore. Sorry every-
one, we just don't believe them
anymore," the man, who refused
to give his name, told a crowd of
reporters Sunday.
By this time, the airline
already had dispatched doz-
ens of caregivers to Beijing and
assigned one to each family,
provided accommodation, food,
transport and financial assis-
tance. It said it was providing
regular updates despite a lack of
information about the plane.
But the initial disorder of
Malaysia Airlines' response, and
its lack of official contact with
relatives in the early going set
the tone for the ensuing hours of
waiting.
"One of the most important
things to remember here," said
Frank Taylor, a former director
of an aviation safety center at
Cranfield University in Britain,
"is that it's much easier to stand
down staff after an initial over-
reaction than to play catch-up
after an initial under-reaction."
The relatives had expected the
plane's arrival at 6:30 a.m. Sat-
urday. About four hours later, a
handwritten note was posted on
a white board in the arrival hall
advising relatives to use a shuttle
service to go to the Lido Hotel to
await information. "It can't be
good," said one weeping woman

aboard the first bus.
But when the family members
got there, they wandered around
lost and distressed before hotel
staff - apparently unprepared -
escorted them into a private area.
It was several more hours before
an airline spokesman made a
brief statement to reporters, pro-
viding little information.
"We're literally trying to find
out what happened and until you
actually find the aircraft youhave
no way of knowing what actu-
ally went on there," the airline's
commercial director, Hugh Dun-
leavy, told The Associated Press
on Sunday. "Our main focus has
been to come here, meet the fam-
ilies, give them as much informa-
tion as we can but without raising
false hopes."
Still, passengers' relatives
gathered in Beijing complained
that the airline hasn't been
forthcoming with information.
Instead of hearing from the car-
rier, they said, they've had to rely
on news reports for updates on
the search.
The initial lack of word led
to criticism that the airline did
nothing in the six hours after the
Boeing 777 jet vanished at 1:20
a.m. while cruising at 36,000
feet. But Dunleavy said the air-
line had immediately notified all
planes in the nearby airspace to
be on the lookout. They contact-

ed air traffic control authorities
in MalaysiaVietnam, and China.
They notified Malaysia's Civil
Aviation Department and Trans-
port Ministry.
The airline made no pub-
lic announcement before the
plane's scheduled 6:30 a.m. land-
ing because it would have had
enough fuel to continue in the air,
Dunleavy said.
About an hour after the
expected arrival time, the airline
released its first statement saying
it had lost contact with the plane.
"It does not mean, and is not
true, that we were not doing
anything in that period. It was
a full ongoing investigation and
search and rescue" by Malaysian
authorities, Dunleavy said.
By Saturday afternoon, the
rumors had started flying, and
airline officials had to verify each
one - all of which took time.
Did the plane land in Nanning,
a southern Chinese city? No, it
did not. Was a crash off the Viet-
nam coast confirmedyIt was not.
Did Vietnamese officials detect
the plane's signal? Officials later
denied it.
In the Lido Hotel, meanwhile,
red-eyed relatives were seeing
the rumors on smartphones but
not hearingthe airline's verifica-
tions. Impatience grew.
After 30 hours had passed
without contact with the plane,

airline officials told the relatives
to prepare for the worst. After
about 36 hours, the relatives at
the Lido issued their statement,
and the man in the black shirt
went before reporters.
"They're still telling us they
can't find this plane," the man
said. "All the information we're
getting is from the media. We,
who are part of the relatives, feel
that this is a very improper and
indifferent way to treat the fam-
ily members."
The airline should have been
more communicative from the
beginning, even if it didn't have
any news to provide, said Ira
Kalb, acrisismanagementexpert
at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles.
"You have got to get out ahead
of the story and you have got to
do whatever you can to comfort
the relatives of the people that
were on the flight," Kalb said. "If
you don't have all the informa-
tion you just say: 'Look, we're
investigating and we're tryingto
get as much information as we
can and as soon as we get it we'll
pass it on to you."'
By later Sunday, the airline
was trying to speak more regu-
larly with relatives and expedite
passport and visa applications
for those who wanted to go to
Malaysia. Even that came under
fire by some family members.

Removing the R-word
Michigan legislature commendably removes term to promote inclusion
ast Wednesday, both houses in the Michigan legislature unanimously
voted to remove the word 'retarded' from state laws. The movement
to remove the word from all official documents throughout the
United States began in 2009 with the "Spread the Word to End the Word"
campaign. This is a commendable move by the Michigan legislature
and demonstrates the state's commitment to the value of all citizens.

Calling all female mentors

etris essential for students to have
mentors. Mentorship is not just
about receiving life, career or
course-related
advice; it's about
personal affirma-
tion. It's about
seeing evidence

sonality, skills,
traits, knowledge
and experience NIVEDITA
can help you
succeed in your KARKI
goals. Seeing that
your "story," if
you will, can go somewhere.
I've asked about five female and
five male friends this question:
"Have you found a mentor in college
yet?" Most of the people in both the
groups weren't really sure about
what the role of a mentor is. Among
the girls, no one seemed to have given
it a thought - at least not in regard to
their instructors in college.
However, it turns out four out of
the fiveguys I talked to have someone
in mind. They thought of instructors
with whom they'd interacted with
regularly during previous courses.
Guy 1 looked up to the ideologies a.
professor whose office hours he had
attended often.
Guy 2 "totally bro-ed out" with a
former GSI who now works for atech
startup while traveling the country.
Guy 3 took an independent study
class and had to meet in-person with
a professor. They both had a common
liking for American football.
For Guy 4, surprisingly, this form
of interaction was getting picked
on in the class. The professor had
randomly chosen to engage in
friendly banter with him during
class, and this gave him all the
more reason to walk into class well
prepared.
Not surprisingly, all their mentors
were male.
These stats are by no way a
representation of the entire student
population, but I'm afraid the figures
won't be too different for a larger
proportion of students.

Eight Michigan House bills and seven
Senate bills will remove the terms "retarded"
and "mental retardation" from a variety
of laws including those that addressing
criminal activity, mental health institutions,
insurance claims, educational facilities,
surrogate parenting, foster care and child care
systems. The term was first used by medical
professionals in 1895 in order to describe
"slow or limited intellectual or emotional
development or academic progress." However,
over time the connotation has morphed into a
term of degradation and insult. Today, the word
has no place in everyday language, let alone
official documents or professional use.

The movement to remove the term from
law is a national trend that has gained
momentum. After Gov. Rick Snyder signs
the package of bills, all but five states in
the United States will have removed the
offensive word from state law. By removing
the word from official documents, Michigan
is demonstrating its respect to individuals
and families affected by intellectual
disabilities. Similarly, the state Senate
voted to mark Wednesday - the day of the
bills' passage - as "Spread the word to end
the word" day across the state. With these
actions, Michigan can move forward as a
more inclusive community.

An edible alternative
Medical marijuana should be available in non-smokable forms for patients
ichigan legislature is currently debatingthe merits of edible
pieces of medical marijuana - non-smokable forms of the
medicine. The effects of medical marijuana are beneficial
for those diagnosed with a number of diseases. The Court of Appeals'
decision to outlaw non-inhalable forms of medical marijuana limits
the efficacy of the drug by alienating patients who have difficulties
inhaling smoke. Michigan legislators need to strongly consider
passing House Bill 5104 to allow the legal distribution of edibles.

In July 2013, the Michigan Supreme Court
ruled that the sale of edible forms of medical
marijuana is not permissible under state law,
deeming non-smokable forms of marijuana to
not be "usable marihuana."
Michigan House Bill 5104, primarily
sponsored by state Rep. Eileen Kowall (R-
District 44), is being proposed in response to
this ruling.
The ban on edible forms of medical
marijuana harms patients who need a method
of ingesting the THC chemical without
inhaling smoke. Forcing young children and
patients with respiratory complications to
inhale smoke to reap the health benefits of
medical marijuana arbitrarily causes hardship

with no apparent benefit.
Medical marijuana is a popular pain reliever
among patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS,
Crohn's disease, insomnia and chronic pain.
However, newer studies have shown evidence
for more peculiar ailments. In small doses,
marijuana has been shown to reduce anxiety
levels and symptoms of ADHD. Similarly,
strains that are high in cannabidiol and low
in THC - such as the popular " Charlotte's
Web" - are being used to treat people with
highly debilitating conditions such as epilepsy
and Parkinson's disease. Legalizing the
distribution of edible forms of marijuana will
allow all patients to efficiently use medical
marijuana for their ailments.

THE CLIMATE COMMITTEE OF LSA UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION |
Promotimg inclusive communities

We are writing to share our concern and
acknowledgement of how challenging, hurtful
and difficult the campus climate has been for
many of our students. From the voices at the
Freeze Out in the Fall to the most recent Speak
Out protest hosted by the United Coalition
for Racial Justice, we are sadly reminded that
this campus community is not as supportive,
welcoming or inclusive as we all wish it to be.
In January, University Provost Martha
Pollack and University President Mary Sue
Coleman reiterated the University's ongoing
commitment to diversity and inclusiveness. We
applaud this commitment and look forward to
contributing to the discussions necessary to
make progress in these areas.
As the directors and senior staff of under-
graduate programs across the College of Lit-
erature, Science and the Arts, we have been
meeting over the past year to identify ways
we can improve the campus climate. Our
work includes developing new workshops
and course modules to help educate students
about issues of personal and social identity,
inclusiveness and intercultural competency.
We are expanding the hands-on diversity
training and guidance for our student staff.
Our aim is for these students to have great-
er intercultural sensitivity, group facilita-
tion and problen-solving abilities in their
varied roles as peer advisors, study group
leaders and mentors. We are enhancing our
professional growth through sharing best
practices and undertaking the kinds of train-
ing we expect of our student leaders and of

ourselves. These efforts will help us promote
more inclusive and safer learning environ-
ments for all students. And we are pursuing
collaborations with Student Life to align our
support for incoming students and our collec-
tive message that we expect and need all stu-
dents on our campus to foster a community
of respect, support and inclusion. Together
we hope that these efforts will facilitate aca-
demic success and an equal opportunity for
students to reach their goals and aspirations
in a welcoming and inclusive environment.
In addition, Undergraduate Education,
a division of LSA, recently sponsored a
workshop series on diversity and climate for
faculty and staff. These workshops focused on
improving climate in classrooms and related
course activities, such as study groups. In
May, two additional teaching institutes will
highlight best practices for inclusive teaching
and learning.
While we occupy a small space on this
campus, we are more committed than ever
to make sure that all of our programs are
safe, respectful, and inclusive and that
those who work for us and participate in our
programs share and demonstrate this same
commitment. We welcome your input on how
we can achieve these goals. Please send an
email to us at lsa.uged.climate@umich.edu.
This article was written by members
of the The Climate Committee of LSA
Undergraduate Education. A full list of the
authors can be found in the online edition.

The past month has been a
flurry of activity surrounding the
infamous Michigan kicker Brendan
Gibbons case. Since the story
broke Jan. 28, the campus erupted
with questions as to how and why
this case was conducted. From
the outside looking in, it's easy to
assume that something went wrong
in the investigation process.
We, as a student body, don't know
exactly what happened. And, frank-
ly, it's none of our business. What
is our business has to do with the
overall rules and procedures of how
sexual misconduct cases are han-
dled at the University of Michigan.
It's not our business to know exactly
how this specific case was handled.
I support the administration's deni-
al of access to Central Student Gov-
ernment's task force to documents
relating to this specific case.
I also support the Office of Civil
Right's investigation of the Uni-
versity's handling of the Gibbons
case. I support it for many reasons
including, but not limited to, the
fact that it will be out of students'
hands. It will be conducted by pro-
fessionals who know the required
policies and who know how a uni-
versity should handle an investiga-
tion correctly. Contrary to the CSG
task force, the team at OCR will
not have to hastily educate them-
selves on basic information regard-
ing sexual assault and the standard
policies in order to conduct a thor-
ough investigation. OCR will have
adequate resources and be able to
reach out to informed individuals
for consultation. This will not be a
project that is in a stack of concerns
in the busy lives of student leaders.
In the old Sexual Misconduct
Policy, pre-2011, there was a part
of the procedures that was particu-
larly problematic and discouraged
survivors of sexual assault to report

what had been done to them. This
was often a trial-like review panel
including peers. It required survi-
vors to compile evidence of their
own case and present it to fellow
students on their own behalf. Even
with promises to ensure confidenti-
ality, the fact that other University
students would know the survivor's
intimate trauma and judge them
was reason enough, in some sur-
vivors' minds, to not report. Addi-
tionally, there was a high likelihood
that the students sitting on that
panel would not be representa-
tive of whom the survivor saw as a
'peer.' The thought of knowing that
other students, not of the survivor's
choosing, would hold such a per-
sonal and terrible story of a survi-
vor's past was a strong deterrence
for relying on the University's pre-
2011 Sexual Misconduct Policy.
This aspect of the procedures
has, thankfully, been omitted in
the new policy that was officially
implemented in the interim policy
in August 2011. What the CSG task
force is doing by investigating the
case as they are is bringing back
something that is reminiscent of
this review panel of peers. While
the intentions are coming from a
good place, ensuring the University
is a safe and just place for students,
the manner in which the task force
is seeking to answer the questions
they initially published is unduly
asking to invade the privacy of
confidential cases that have been
put into the hands of the University
professionals for a reason.
It's not other students' business
to know what happened in regard
to any specific case of sexual
misconduct. It is, however, the
general student body's and CSG's
business to know that the University
is acting with integrity and up to the
standards that it laid out in the 2013

Student Sexual Misconduct Policy.
The policy itself can be found online,
and there are staff members of the
University who are well versed in
the policy and would be more than
willing to explain the entire process
to any student that asked. Not many
students have been asking the right
questions, but is that a responsibility
to be put on the students?
With this is the importance of
maintaining privacy alongside
transparency, and it's something
thatthe Universityhas not been pro-
active about. There was not a conve-
nient briefing for the student body
regarding the new policy imple-
mentation (there was an e-mail that
many did not take the time to read).
There's not yet been training given
to faculty regarding the policy even
though they interact with students
closely each and every day. This
culture must change. The adminis-
tration did not proactively inform
the University community; instead,
they waited to react to students'
frantic questions that were based on
pieced-together information.
I wholeheartedly support the
investigation of the University of
Michigan through the Office of
Civil Rights and hope that this
campus can unite to use our student
voices productively to continue
to influence positive change in
the administration. The constant
dialogue around the Brendan
Gibbons case is alienating to many
on campus, and it is creating a
climate that can exclude survivors
by constant triggers. We want a
campus that builds survivors up
rather than making their pain a
hot topic. I hope that the federal
investigation aids in this progress
and gives our campus some closure.

Jesus is back. And he's white.

"Son of God," Son of God

tuguese actor and Rave
Diogo Morgado
- best known FOX
for playing the
same role on
History Channel's "The Bible."
Though there is a mix of ethnici-
ties throughout the film, almost
all of the important characters are
white. It's apparent that people
(specifically, Christians) still cling
to the idea of a white messiah,
when it seems pretty obvious that
the actual Jesuswas some shade of
brown.
John, one of Jesus's apostles,
tells the story through a flashback.
He gives a quick recap of history

pe
(Adam and Eve, Noah, etc.), dis
cusses Jesus's birth, then (jus
like "The Bible") flashes forwari
to Jesus as a man, leaving out an
mention of his developmenta
years. Throughout the film, John'
voiceovers are few, but when pres
ent they serve as a crutch for th.
filmmakers, simplifying the story
telling of already straightforwarc
material.
There is no originality. There i
no creativity. Nothing about "Sot
of God" offers any value except fo
someone seeking to mix and masl
Jesus's greatest hits. He heal

walks on water, but at the end o
the day, there is no exploration o
Jesus's character, and everythin

they introduced Kryptonite to th
Superman universe. While Marti;
Scorsese's "The Last Temptatio;

Jesus as a man with doubts, con
cerns and fear, without questiot
makes it a better film.
There simply is no saving grac
for "Son of God." Even the aes
thetics aren't high quality in thi
adaptation. Every establishin

Do films cause cancer?

By ZACHARY WHITUS
For the Daily
The "sexiness" of cigarettes
confuses me. On the one hand,
cigarettes aren't cool anymore.
Teachers spanked their positive
propagandaintomygenerationand
we accepted it: "Smoking causes
cancer." On the other hand, many
more (myself included) find ciga-
rette smoking strangely attractive.
Howisthispossible?Despiteallmy
science-based stigma induced by
grade-school propaganda, some-
thing somewhere in my upbring-
ing must still be pressing me to
smoke cigarettes. There is no more
Joe Camel or Marlboro Man (does
anyone even know these names
anymore?). There are no more cig-
arette TV commercials. But there
are still many films, old and new,
that depict, celebrate and/or sexu-
alize smoking. Cinema seems to be
apre-carcinogen.
I want to look at one scene from
one film in particular: Woody
Allen's "Manhattan."
"Manhattan" depicts the psy-
chological conflict between our
understanding that smoking
causes cancer and the self-reflec-
tive aesthetic pleasure of smoking
a cigarette; in short, it depicts the
absurdity of the modern American
attitude toward smoking. In this
scene, earlyon inthe film, Woody's
character, Isaac, pulls out a ciga-
rette and lights it.

Legitimacy of Ukraine's
government challenged

Kremlin fails to
heed U.S. demands
to withdraw toops
from Crimea
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Rus-
sia said Monday it is drafting
counterproposals to a U.S. plan
for a negotiated solution to the
Ukraine crisis, denouncing the
new Western-backed govern-
ment as an unacceptable "fait
accompli" and claiming that
Russian-leaning parts of the
country have been plunged into
lawlessness.
The Kremlin moves came as
Russian forces strengthened
their control over Crimea, less
than a week before the strategic
region is to hold a contentious
referendum on whether to split
off and become part of Russia.
In a televised briefing with
President Vladimir Putin, Rus-
sian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov said proposals made by
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry are "not suitable" because
they take "the situation cre-
ated by the coup as a starting
point," referring to the ouster
of Ukraine's pro-Kremlin presi-
dent, Viktor Yanukovych.
Referring to a document he
received from Kerry explaining
the U.S. view of the situation
in Ukraine, Lavrov said: "To be
frank, it raises many questions
on our side."
"Everything was stated in
terms of allegedly having a
conflict between Russia and
Ukraine, and in terms of accept-
ing the fait accompli," he said.
Lavrov said Kerry delayed a
visit to Moscow to discuss the
situation, and Russia had decid-
ed to prepare new proposals of
its own, though he did not say
what they were.
"We suggested that he come
today ... and we were prepared
to receive him. He gave his
preliminary consent. He then
called me on Saturday and said
he would like topostpone it for a
while," the minister said.
But in Washington, State
Department officials said that
it was Russia's refusal to dis-

cuss the American proposals
that was hurting prospects for
a negotiated solution - in par-
ticular, the idea of direct talks
between Russian officials and
those of the new Ukrainian gov-
ernment.
"We are still awaiting a Rus-
sian response to the concrete
questions that Secretary Kerry
sent Foreign Minister Lavrov on
Saturday in this regard," State
Department spokeswoman Jen
Psaki said in a statement.
"Secretary Kerry made clear
to Foreign Minister Lavrov that
he would welcome further dis-
cussions focused on how to de-
escalate the crisis in Ukraine if
and when we see concrete evi-
dence that Russia is prepared to
engage on these proposals," she
said.
The statement said Kerry, in
weekend discussions with Lav-
rov, reiterated Washington's
demand that Moscow pull back
its troops from Ukraine and end
attempts to annex the Crimean
peninsula. Kerry also called on
Russia to cease what the state-
ment described as "provocative
steps" to allow diplomatic talks
to continue.
Meanwhile, Ukraine's for-
eign minister said Monday that
his country was practically
in a state of war with Russia,
whose forces have effectively
taken control over the Crimean
Peninsula in what has become
Europe's greatest geopolitical
crisis since the end of the Cold
War.
"We have to admit that our
life now is almost like ... a war,"
Foreign Minister Andrii Desh-
chytsya said before meeting his
counterparts from Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxem-
bourg. "We have to cope with
an aggression that we do not
understand."
Deshchytsya said Ukraine is
counting on help from the West.
Prime Minister Arseniy Yatse-
nyuk is to meet with President
Barack Obama in Washington
on Wednesday.
On Monday, the Russian For-
eign Ministry denounced the
lawlessness it said "now rules in
eastern regions of Ukraine as a
result of the actions of fighters

of the so-called 'Right Sector,'
with the full connivance" of
Ukraine's new authorities.
Right Sector is a grouping of
far-right and nationalist factions
whose activists were among the
most radical and confrontation-
al of the three-monthlong dem-
onstrations in the Ukrainian
capital, Kiev, which eventually
ousted Yanukovych,
The Kremlin statement also
claimed Russian citizens try-
ing to enter Ukraine have been
turned back at the border by
Ukrainian officials.
Pro-Russia sentiment is high
in Ukraine's east and there are
fears Russia could seek to incor-
porate that area as well.
Obama has warned that the
March 16 referendum in Crimea
would violate international law,
and Putin countered that in
phone calls with German Chan-
cellor Angela Merkel and British
Minister David Cameron.
"The steps taken by the legiti-
mate leadership of Crimea are
based on the norms of interna-
tional law and aim to ensure the
legal interests of the population
of the peninsula," Putin said,
according to the Kremlin.
Meanwhile, Obama spoke by
telephone with Chinese Presi-
dent Xi Jinping late Sunday,
trying to court China's sup-
port for efforts to isolate Russia
over its military intervention in
Ukraine.
Obama appealed to Beijing's
vehement opposition to outside
intervention in other nations'
domestic affairs, according to a
White House statement.
Obama "noted his over-
riding objective of restoring
Ukraine's sovereignty and ter-
ritorial integrity and ensuring
the Ukrainian people are able
to determine their own future
without foreign interference,"
the statement said, adding that
the two leaders "agreed on the
importance of upholding prin-
ciples of sovereignty and territo-
rial integrity."
China has been studiously
neutral since the Ukraine crisis
began and it remained unclear
whether China would side with
the U.S. and Europe or with
Moscow.

Marchers gather in front of the Florida Supreme Court Monday in Tallahassee, Fla.
Sharpton leads protestors
against 'stand your gound

U.S. Rep. says bill
has devolved into
protecting violence
instead of safety
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP)
- The Rev. Al Sharpton led
hundreds of people on a march
Monday to the state Capitol,
where they rallied against Flori-
da's "stand your ground" law.
Among those present were the
parents of slain black teenager
Trayvon Martin and the family
of Marissa Alexander, who was
sentenced to 20 years for firing
a gun near her estranged hus-
band.
The crowd rallied on the Cap-
itol steps across from Florida's
Supreme Court.
"To have laws that tell people
that they-can shoot first and then
ask questions later is a violation
of our civil rights. I believe that
law is inherently wrong," Sharp-
ton said before the march began.
"The law in effect says based on
your imagination - if you imag-
ine I'm a threat - you have the
right to kill me."
Sharpton called Florida
"ground zero" for the fight
against 'stand your ground.'
Protesters waved signs saying
"STANDING OUR GROUND"
and wore T-shirts reading, "We

are not a threat." Images of
Martin were pictured on signs,
shirts and drawings. Sharpton's
National Action Network joined
other groups in backing the
rally.
Florida law says people who
are not involved in illegal activ-
ity have the right to stand their
ground and meet force with
force, including deadly force, if
they reasonably believe it's nec-
essary to avoid death or great
bodily harm.
Those present said reforms
are needed.
"Everybody trying to stand in
solidarity and show that these
laws that don't apply tous, we're
here to change them," said Tracy
Martin, Trayvon's father, speak-
ing with The Associated Press.
Martin's son was fatally shot
by neighborhood watch volun-
teer George Zimmerman, who
later was acquitted of second-
degree murder.
"What the law is actually say-
ing is this country doesn't value
the life of black and brown kids.
We want our kids to under-
stand their lives are equal value
of anybody else life," the elder
Martin said.
Florida's Republican-domi-
nated Legislature has declined
calls for substantial changes
to the stand your ground law
enacted in 2005. Democrats
have filed bills to repeal the law

or amend it in recent years.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Corrine
Brown, of Jacksonville, spoke at
the rally, exhorting change.
"I've never seen a perfect bill
and changes need to happen
with this bill," Brown told AP
afterward. "When they started,
it had good intentions. Pro-
tect your castle. But they have
extended it to, you don't like the
color of my dress and you feel
threatened after you start a fight
- there's something wrong with
that."
Last summer, members of a
group calling itself the Dream
Defenders held a monthlong
sit-in at the state Capitol urg-
ing lawmakers to call a special
session to overhaul the law. But
Gov. Rick Scott and legislative
leaders declined.
"This is the governor's oppor-
tunity to really show that he's a
leader for all Floridians, not just
the few," state Rep. Alan Wil-
liams, D-Tallahassee, said. "This
was the first state that imple-
mented 'stand your ground,' this
should be the first state to repeal
'stand your ground.'
Others at Monday's rally
included the family of Oscar
Grant, a 22-year-old fatally shot
by a police officer while hand-
cuffed in a train station, and the
family of Michael Giles, a U.S.
Airman sentenced to 25 years in
a self-defense case.

Via video chat,
former bomber
provides account of
terror training
NEW YORK (AP) - Jurors
at the terrorism trial of Osama
bin Laden's son-in-law watched
him threaten there would be no
end to the "storm of airplanes"
on videotapes made in the days
after the Sept. 11 attacks Mon-
day justbefore a British man tes-
tified by video from London that
he trained to blow up a plane in
late 2001 with a shoe bomb.
Prosecutors showed the New
York jury video clips of Sulai-
man Abu Ghaith, threatening
Americans in the weeks after
the terror attacks toset the stage
for testimony from Saajid Badat,
a 34-year-old United Kingdom
resident who refuses to testify
in the United States because he
faces terrorism charges in Bos-
ton that could send him to pris-
on for life.
Badat said he trained with
failed shoe-bomber Richard
Reid to carry out separate shoe-
bomb attacks aimed at down-
ing planes over America or in
Europe in the months after the
Sept. 11 attacks were carried out
with four hijacked airplanes.
He pleaded guilty in England
in 2005 to conspiring to harm an
aircraft and served six years in
prison before his sentence was
shortened through his coopera-
tion. His plea came in connec-
tion with a 2001 plot to down an
American Airlines flight from
Paris to Miami with explosives
hidden in his shoes.
Prosecutors are using Badat's
testimony to show that Abu
Ghaith, as al-Qaida's spokes-
man, was in the thick of a con-

spiracy to create a second wave
of airborne terrorism attacks
while the debris left by the top-
pled twin towers of the World
Trade Center was still burning.
Abu Ghaith is charged with
conspiring to kill Americans
and providing material support
to al-Qaida. If convicted, the
48-year-old onetime imam at a
Kuwaiti mosque could face life
in prison. He has pleaded not
guilty.
Immediately before Badat's
testimony, prosecutors showed
jurors a 50-second clip of a
5-minute videotape of Abu
Ghaith from Oct. 9, 2001, in
which he threatens that "Amer-
ica must know that the storm of
airplanes will not abate, with
God's permission." Alluding to
martyrdom, he said there were
"youths who are yearning to
death just as Americans yearn
to live."
Then prosecutors showed
nearly 2 minutes of an 8-minute
videotape from Oct. 13, 2001,
in which Abu Ghaith threatens
America again, saying some in
the U.S. had not understood the
gravity of his earlier message.
"The storm of aircrafts will
not stop," he said at one point,
according to an English trans-
lation of Arabic statements that
was introduced as a court exhib-
it. "We strongly advise Muslims
in America and the Britain, the
children and those who reject
unjust American policies, not
to board aircraft and we advise
them not to live in high-rises
and tall buildings."
Despite many months spent
in al-Qaida training camps and
locations in Afghanistan from
1999 through 2001, Badat testi-
fied that he did not recognize a
photograph of Abu Ghaith and
did not recall having ever seen
or heard him.

Wagner stays undefeated

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan softball coach
Carol Hutchins said before the
season that she'd rotate her three
pitchers until one stood out.
But with the pitching tapering,
Hutchins might be forced to go
with the hot hand.
Junior left-hander Haylie
Wagner is that hot hand at
the moment, and the Big Ten
Pitcher of the Year's numbers
have stolen the show: 63.1
innings, 37 hits allowed,
eight earned runs allowed, 55
strikeouts and a 0.88 ERA.
She's started eight games and
gone the distance in seven of
them. Last weekend, Wagner
earned Michigan's only two
wins with a pair of complete-
game four-hitters against No. 7
Arizona and Texas.

that's what we ask our pitchers to The Judi Garman Classic
do, that's what we ask our defense in Fullerton, Calif this past

weekend was the first time
Wagner earned a significantly
greater portion of innings.
Prior to last week, each pitcher
had started three games, and
Wagner had thrown just 7.1 more
innings than Betsa and 10.2 more
than Driesenga. Now, Wagner
has 63.1 innings to Betsa's 45 and
Driesenga's 38.2.
After Betsa started against
No. 6 Washington and Houston
and Driesenga pitched against
No. 10 Arizona State - all losses
- Wagner got the nod in the final
two games of the tournament
and won both. Even as the team
- especially thebats - struggled,
Wagner was dominant.
"Sometimes it's hard, but I
do know that I have my team
out there to help me with that,"
Wagner said. "You have to find
the one-pitch focus even if you
are struggling. You have to clear
your mind of everything else,
and you have to focus on that
pitch. If I am struggling, I have
to step back and remind myself
of that."
Early in the season, Wagner
often had the luxury of pitching
with big leads, most notably
in a 15-1, 5-inning victory over
Louisiana-Lafayette on Feb. 15.
But as thehbats have cooled down,
scoring three runs or fewer in
nine of the past 11 games, she
hasn't heen so lucky.
Still, she won a close contest
against No. 5 Kentucky on
Feb. 22, 3-0, and worked the
eighth and ninth innings to
help beat Kent State, 1-0. Then,
in Fullerton, she outdueled
Arizona, 3-0, and Texas, 3-1.
Wagner still must compete
with a reigning First Team All-
Big Ten pitcher in Driesenga and
a hard-throwing freshman in
Betsa, so the pitching rotation is
still just that - a rotation.
But if Wagner keeps carrying
the staff, it may not be much of
one for too long.

first time in career

PAULmH ERMAN/Daly
Junior left-hander Haylie Wagner has ihrown a complete game is sores ot her eitht games started this season.

Why losing was necessary

record is the standard
barometer by which
team is measured. But
for the No. 20 Michigan water
polo team, the record portrays
only one part of the progress
that has
been made,
It started
Jan. 18,
when the
Wolverines
jumped in
the pool at
Canham BRAD
Natatorium WHIPPLE
only to
sink at the
hands of one
of their toughest opponents,
Indiana. The captains tried
to surface a wrecked ship, but
took one blow after another.
From this point on, it
looked like there'd only be a
downward spiral.
Michigan's crew consists
of 19 underclassmen and five
upperclassmen. With 12 ranked
opponents in the Wolverines'
first 14 games, the younger
players were forced to adjust
rapidly to the rigorous pace
of collegiate water polo, and
pulled off three wins against
ranked teams.
As if Michigan wasn't
struggling enough with a
team strung together with
eight freshmen, it was dealt
a blow when senior attacker
Hathaway Moore broke her
thumb two weeks into the
season, stunting the team's
chances of growing at all.
The confidence seemed
absent, the future looked
dismal and the inexperience
seemed to doom the
Wolverines from the start -
seven straight losses through
January and early February.
But Michigan needed to
suffer these early season losses
to understand how to win now
when it mattered most.
The losing woes that plagued
the first two months of the
season were simply Michigan's
cleansing stage, extinguishing
all the problems that persisted

for half of the season. It was
a time to take a step back and
reevaluate the direction of the
season.
"It's easy to forget that you
need to get better when you
win games, and it's easier to
remember you need to get
better when you lose games,"
Anderson said. "That's what
this team has really taken
to heart because of how we
started."
In this case, you had to lose
some to win some.
The embarrassingly meek
offensive effort that defined
the beginning of the season
needed to be addressed. The
late-game deficits that were too
large to rebound from and the
shots that just weren't hitting
the back of the net. Over the
first seven games of the season,
the Wolverines netted 50 total
goals compared to 90 during
the last seven.
ifaMichien (0-2 Colleoiate

Division, 10-10 overall) were
to go a game without several
players earning hat tricks,
it would be unusual. Now
it's just a norm, even for the
underclassmen.
There was a problem with
the team's chemistry - an
experiment gone wrong.
With the lack of effective
communication during games,
disorganization ensued and
whatever goal the Wolverines
had for this season didn't look
attainable. Though they are a
team, they didn't play like one.
When Moore returned two
weeks ago, she brought back
the team-first mindset that
had been absent. But the words
of a team captain wouldn't
be enough - the Wolverines
used Spring Break to train
with the Canadian national
team in Montreal. Rather than
spending time on the beach,
the players spent time solely
with each other learnine

single group rather than for an
individual.
Midway through February,
it looked like Michigan was
on track for its first-ever
losing season. The Wolverines
entered March 3-10 on the
season, and for one moment, it
looked as if they would not rise
above .500 again.
Now Michigan is riding a
seven-game win streak that
evened out its record. Up next
is the Wolverine Invitational,
a home event the Wolverines
haven't lost a game in since 2007.
The losses in the beginning
of the season were about
steering a broken ship back on
a track.
They were about piecing
together a team that has
finished first 11 times at the
CWPA Western Division
Championship.
They were about making a
12th title a reality.
They were about more than
a record.

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
Sophomore forward Kelsey
Mitchell made her first-ever
appearance in a Michigan
uniform in Thursday's first-
round Big Ten
Tournament NOTEBOOK
game against
Indiana. The Detroit native tore
her anterior cruciate ligament
before her freshman season and
suffered a foot fracture during
preseason workouts this year.
Her debut came on the
biggest of stages - Bankers
Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis,
home of the NBA's Indiana
Pacers. Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico didn't warn her
that she'd be making her debut
in the game's final minutes,
either.
"I was quite surprised," said
Mitchell last Thursday. "To
actually step out on the court
wearing a Michigan uniform
was truly a blessing."
Leading by more than 20 with
two minutes remaining, Barnes
Arico also rewarded fifth-year
senior forward Kendra Seto,
sophomore forward Rebecca
Lyttle and freshman guard
Danielle Williams with playing
time alongside Mitchell against
the Hoosiers.
Thompson on track:
Suffice to say there have been
high expectations for guard
Siera Thompson since Day One
of this season, and she hasn't
disappointed. The freshman has
played in all 31 games this year
and has drained at least one
3-pointer in every contest.
She also holds the freshman
record in the program for most
3-pointers in a season with
69, an award she earned back
in January against Nebraska.
Amy Johnson, one of the top
three leading freshman scorers
in Michigan history, set the
previous record with 49 during
the 1993-94 season.

In addition, Thompson
has 411 points this year, and
averaged almost 14 points per
game. She fell just 11 points short
of taking over the third place
spot for most points scored by
a freshman, and she was fewer
than 50 points from taking
the second-place record from
Michigan women's basketball
legend Diane Dietz.
Dietz was the leading scorer
for the Wolverines in her four
seasons at Michigan (1978-
82), and she holds the all-time
scoring record with 2,066
points. Thompson has put
herself in a position to stand
with some of the all-time greats
in her program if she continues
to have the shooting success
she's had this season.
Fouls stunt Wolverines:
Staying out of foul trouble early
in games has been a majorrhurdle
the Wolverines have struggled
to overcome this season.
Michigan doesn't boast a very
big lineup - only two starters,
Goree and senior forward Val
Driscoll, stand over six feet tall
- and it has a relatively short
bench. Nicole Elmblad is 5-foot-
11, and losing any of them to
foul trouble has proven to be a
major blow to the Wolverine's
defense. The issue arose it the
Big Ten semifinal loss to No. 19
Michigan State last Friday.
"When Cyesha picked up her
second foul, they kept their big
lineup in," Barnes Arico said
after the game. "We had four
guards in and (Michigan State)
really took advantage of our
zone, and they got the ball inside
and that's when they made their
run at the end of the first half."
Elmblad fouled out of
the game with four minutes
remaining, while Driscoll and
Goree finished with four and
three, respectively. The loss
to the Spartans highlighted
how fragile the defense can be
without the height and power of
Michigan's tallest starters.

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's
basketball team's trophy
case better be big, because
its recently acquired Big Ten
championship trophy is going
to have company.
On Monday night, the Big
Ten announced individual
postseason honors for the
recently completed 2014 regular
season, with the Wolverines
racking up the awards.
Sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas was named the Big Ten
Player of the Year, Michigan
coach John Beilein earned
Coach of the Year honors from
the media, freshman guard
Derrick Walton Jr. claimed
a spot on the all-freshman
team and sophomore guard
Caris LeVert was selected
to the all-conference second
team. Sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III also was
among the winners with an all-
conference honorable mention.
Stauskas' honor makes
it back-to-backhyears that a
Wolverine has won Big Ten
Player of the Year. Former
Michigan guard Trey Burke
took home the award last
season - the first Wolverine
to do so in program history.
Stauskas was also the only
player in the conference to
receive a unanimous nod for
All-Big Ten first team by the
media and the coaches.
Stauskas - who also earned
Big Ten Player of the Week
honors on Monday for the
fourth time this season -
helped lead Michigan to its
first outright conference title
since 1985-86. The 6-foot-
Mississauga, Ontario native
led the team in scoring,
averaging 17.4 points per
game - good enough for
fourth best in the conference.
His 71 3-pointers and nearly
46-percent mark beyond the
are were third best among Big
Ten players. The guard also
averaged more than three
assists and rebounds per game.
Burke was the ninth overall
pick in last year's NBA draft,
and many project Stuskas
could follow in his footsteps
and go early in the first round
of this year's draft if he were to
declare for it.
Beilein's Coach of the
Year honor is the fifth of his
career. He received the honor
in 1981 while coaching Erie
Community College, in 1988
at LeMoyne, in 1994 while
heading Canisius' program and
in 1998 at Richmond.
Beilein led Michigan to
a 23-7 overall record and a
15-3 conference mark. In his

seventh season as coach of
the Wolverines, Beilein was
faced with the challenge of.
replacing the pillars of the
team that reached the National
Championship last year in
Burke and former Michigan
guard Tim Hardaway Jr.,
who both left for the NBA.
To make matters worst, he
also had to replace sophomore
forward Mitch McGary who
underwent back surgery early
in the season.
But Beilein made due with
the players he had, many of
whom stepped into bigger
roles to replace the lost talent.
LeVert, who was a redshirt
prospect last year, stayed in
Ann Arbor over the summer
along with Stauskas to prep
for his sophomore season.
LeVert's work in the weight
room paid off - he bulked up
from 170 pounds last year to
185 pounds this season - as he
became one of the Wolverines'
most dangerous and consistent
offensive weapons.
The sophomore guard
started in every one of
Michigan's 30 games and
averaged 13.4 points per game
- usually while guarding
the opponent's best offensive
player. LeVert led the team in
steals with 36 on the season -
12th most in the conference.
Walton's all-freshman
team honor helps carry on a
Michigan freshman tradition.
Walton is the fourth straight
Wolverine to receive the
honor following Robinson
last season, Burke in 2012 and
Hardaway in 2011.
The first-year guard from
Detroit averaged more than
eight points and a touch
fewer than three assists per
game. After adjusting to the
pace of the college game, he
showed tremendous poise
quarterbacking Michigan's
offense. In late January he
stepped up in East Lansing,
scoring a career-best 19 points
to help lead the Wolverines
past Michigan State.
Despite averaging 13.2
points per game and scoring
in double digits on 22 different
occasions, Robinson's award
is a disappointment. He was
selected to the preseason
All-Big Ten team and after
averaging 11 points last year,
many thought he would put up
numbers more comparable to
Stauskas'.
The awards are nice
reminders of the regular
season year that was. But
ultimately, Michigan hopes
to have the newly collected
hardware overshadowed by
an even bigger team-earned
trophy in April.

Wolverines a six-point lead,
their largest at that point in the
game. Later in the frame, he
reached down to grapple for a
loose-ball rebound and came up
with the ball - his 10th board
of the night to complement his
15 points - his first double-
double of the season and fifth of
his career.
With three seconds left in
the game, and Michigan's four-
point lead safe, Beilein put
Morgan back on the floor so
that when the buzzer sounded
in the senior's final home game,
he would be out there to take it
all in.
December 18, 2007 - not
"December 1963," but still
"Oh, What a Night" for the
Wolverines. It was then that
Morgan committed to playing
basketball at Michigan. More
than six years removed from

the decision he made as a junior
at Detroit Jesuit High School
and he finally got what he came
for - a Big Ten title that was his
alone.
No, Morgan is not this team's
MVP, and chances are, after
this year, his master's degree in
manufacturing engineering will
be a more likely to land him a
job than his rebounding ability,
but the captain is still a critical
part of the Wolverines' success.
"I just think (redshirt junior
Jon Horford and I) have a
perspective of this team that's
kind of the last of what was of
Michigan basketball," Morgan
said in October at Big Ten media
day. "We've seen the good and
the bad, and we know what it
takes to make it to where we've
gotten - Big Ten championship,
National Championship
appearance. So I think we just
kind of do a good job of keeping
everybody focused."
That leadership and

mentality, to go along with more
than five points per game and
nearly five rebounds per game
this season, earned Morgan,
and the Wolverines another Big
Ten championship banner -
one they don't have to share.
"I mean you talk about
five years worth of emotions
wrapped up into one day,"
Morgan said after the game. "So
much work, sweat, adversity
that went into just putting this
program where it is, just years
and years of battling. It's like a
constant battle for five years no
matter what it is, whether it's
on the court or off the court.
This is the culmination of all
that."
And on Saturday, Morgan
cried like a bigboy. He walked
like a man. And oh, what a night
to go out on.

defense, make big plays, and for
the most part he has."
This season, Clare has
blocked a team-high 72 shots,
27 more than the next closest
teammate - senior defenseman
Mac Bennett. Over the past six
games, Clare has recorded a
plus-five rating and blocked 18
shots, which rankes among the
top on the team in that span.
Clare's game has become
similar to his personality. It
isn't nonexistent, just what's
necessary. It isn't over the top
or flashy, but it gets the job done.
"He's not quiet, he's not loud,"
said freshman defenseman
Kevin Lohan. "He's a funny guy,
though."
On a team that has struggled
to show consistency and put
together a series without a split
as of late, Clare's presence has
been important.He rarely takes
a penalty - only four this year
for eight minutes - and he has
posted a plus/minus rating of
zero. His willingness to block
shots and to make an extra pass
has been key. Clare's 10 assists is
second only to Bennett.

Senior defenseman Kevin Clare may not be the most vocal player, but he has excelled at leading by example this season.
