With the renovation of the 
Michigan Union underway, stu-
dents and faculty will decide on 
which three vendors will move 
into the space when it reopens 
in the winter of 2020. Members 
of the University of Michigan 
community 
expressed 
con-
cern regarding the potential of 
Wendy’s moving back into the 
building due to employee labor 
conditions.
Washtenaw Solidarity with 
Farmworkers, 
a 
community 
and student-based group, has 
been lobbying the administra-
tion and the Central Student 
Government to ban Wendy’s 
from coming back to campus 

until the fast-food establish-
ment has signed the Fair Food 
Program.
The Fair Food Program is 
a partnership between farm-
workers and food distribution 
companies to ensure agricul-
tural workers have access to 
adequate working conditions 
and fair wages. Fourteen com-
panies have signed on, includ-
ing large grocery distributors 
such as Walmart and Whole 
Foods Market and fast food 
chains such as Burger King, 
McDonald’s and Subway.
Rackham student Kimberly 
Daley has led the on-campus 
effort to ensure Wendy’s will 
not be put in the basement of 
the Union. Daley believes it’s 
likely Wendy’s submitted a bid 

for the Union based on their 
widespread representation on 
college campuses. She empha-
sized Wendy’s lack of transpar-
ency regarding the Fair Food 
Program.
“Wendy’s hasn’t signed on 
(to the agreement) and they 
have been avoiding the sign 
on process,” Daley said. “They 
moved all of their purchases of 
tomatoes to Mexico to avoid it, 
and then they moved it all back 
to greenhouses in the U.S. and 
none of those have actually 
good working conditions.”
Two Wendy’s restaurants 
previously resided in the Union 
and in the Michigan League 
before their contracts expired. 
She began the process by meet-
ing with Susan Pile, the Union 

administrator at the time, and 
the Office of Procurement, but 
quickly became frustrated with 
their lack of response.
“Since 2015-2016, I’ve been 
in contact with administration 
and University to either cut 
the contract with Wendy’s or 
make sure that they couldn’t 
come back to campus after the 
contract expired,” Daley said. 
“Both of them told me there 
was nothing they could do and 
they couldn’t cut the contract 
with Wendy’s because they 
needed the money. And for 
procurement, said they can’t 
legally make rules, suppos-
edly, about who can or cannot 
submit bid to be vendors at 
the University.”

As the University of Michigan 
continues to increase enrollment, 
multiple new student housing 
developments in Ann Arbor have 
been proposed for the coming 
year. Triad Real Estate Partners 
reported that off-campus housing 
occupancy for students last fall 
sat at 98.3 percent, compared to a 
national average of 95.2 percent. 
This demand for student housing 
continues to grow, according to 
the report from Triad Real Estate 
Partners.
According to Triad, rent for 
off-campus housing has also 
grown, having risen by 4.64 
percent since last year. Recent 
luxury-based student housing 
developments 
contribute 
to this rise in cost. Limited 
affordable housing has sparked 
a conversation around campus, 
especially within Central Student 
Government.
Ann Arbor approved plans 
in November for a new 28-bed 
student apartment building on 
Hill Street, estimated to cost $1 
million to build.

Adaptable 
resolution
introduced
to SSMP

Solution offers options 
for sexual misconduct 
cases at the University

The University of Michigan’s 
new interim student sexual mis-
conduct policy expands the use 
of additional options and support 
for students who may not want to 
pursue a hearing and investiga-
tion. The pathway, called adapt-
able resolution, was outlined in 
the December 2018 revisions, 
which took effect Jan. 9.
The new Interim Policy and 
Procedures on Student Sexual 
and Gender-Based Misconduct 
and Other Forms of Interper-
sonal Violence was also updated 
to include an in-person hearing. 
During the investigation process 
both the accused and the accuser 
will be able to cross-examine 
each other and the witnesses.
This revision was implement-
ed in accordance with the Sep-
tember U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Sixth Circuit ruling that 
public universities must give the 
accused student or their adviser 
the opportunity to cross-exam-
ine the accuser and witnesses. 
The University petitioned for a 
rehearing in late September. The 
circuit court denied the petition 
in October of 2018.

In

the shelters for opening

people get out of the cold, 
but said more still needed 

to be done.
“I don’t think we go far 
enough and these sort of 
conversations 
shouldn’t 
have to take place because 
it should be a given that 
everyone has a warm place

“It’s far from an ideal 
situation. I believe that it 
shouldn’t be an emergency 
to make the shelter and the 
warming centers extend 
their hours. It should just 
be normal practice.”

Local institutions including restaurants and bakeries close their doors

ZAYNA SYED
Daily Staff Reporter

In 
November 
2018, 
Ann 
Arbor’s beloved MD Bagel Fra-
gel was forced to close shop. A 
family-owned business of 25 
years that attracted customers 
through its local vibe and “fra-
gel,” a shop staple consisting of 
deep fried raisin dough covered 
in cinnamon sugar, its owners 
were given two days to move 
out of their location on Broad-
way Square after the building 
was purchased by a company 
from Toledo.
Community outrage ensued, 
with 
supporters 
starting 
a 
GoFundMe that accrued more 
than $11,000 and Underground 
Printing 
creating 
T-shirts 
printed 
with 
the 
phrase 
“#SaveBagelFragel”. The new 

owners of the building gave the 
business an extension, allow-
ing them to move out by the end 
of the year before turning the 
space into a marijuana dispen-
sary. 
MD Bagel Fragel is one of 
18 Ann Arbor businesses that 
closed in 2018. For many Ann 
Arbor residents, the closure of 
small businesses comes with a 
community cost. Of the 18 busi-
nesses that closed in 2018, nine 
of them were open for more 
than 25 years, with only two 
businesses being open for two 
years or less.
In an email interview with 
The Daily, MD Bagel Fragel 
shop owner Patricia Rockette 
offered some advice to City 
Council.
“Stop letting the big corpora-
tions like Starbucks go in which 

forces the small businesses out 
of business,” Rockette wrote. 
“They cannot compete. Land-
lords raise the rent so much, 
that only big, unfeeling compa-
nies can survive.”
City 
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, used to hold 
coffee hours at Electric Eye 
Café, a business that also closed 
in 2018. According to Hayner, 
the loss of businesses such 
as Electric Eye Café and MD 
Bagel Fragel are often unquan-
tifiable.
“Businesses come and go, 
and especially these small busi-
nesses, but there were some 
that has really been sad with the 
community, especially my con-
stituents,” Hayner said. “A lot 
of these small businesses like 
that, they actually play a role in 
the community in a small way, 

where they offer their room up 
for meetings, or they host dif-
ferent events or creative things. 
When these small businesses go 
away, sometimes you lose those 
things that aren’t quantifiable.” 
While records tracking the 
number of businesses that have 
closed in Ann Arbor over the 
past few years do not exist, 
some estimate this is a relative-
ly large amount to close in one 
year, particularly since 2018 
proved strong for the overall 
economy.
Six of the businesses that 
closed in 2018 belonged to the 
dining industry, such as MD 
Bagel Fragel and Pieology Piz-
zeria. However, the majority 
of closures — 10 — were retail 
businesses.

The partial government 
shutdown — which ended 
temporarily on Sunday as 
lawmakers work to create an 
agreeable budget — directly 
impacted the ability of re-
searchers at the Cooperative 
Institute for Great Lakes Re-
search to publish their find-
ings.
Professor and ecologist at 

the University of Michigan’s 
School for Environment and 
Sustainability, Bradley Car-
dinale serves as director of 
the CIGLR, a research orga-
nization sponsored by the 
University and the National 
Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration.
Cardinale says his organi-
zation works with NOAA and 
represents about 50 percent 
of NOAA’s research and man-
agement operations in the 

Great Lakes. While his orga-
nization was able to continue 
its research despite the shut-
down, the data CIGLR col-
lected during the shutdown 
could not be uploaded to 
NOAA’s online models, which 
are used by the public, until 
the shutdown ended.
“The impact of the govern-
ment shutdown was sort of 
good news, bad news with 
respect to our particular or-
ganization,” Cardinale said. 
“The bad news is all of 
the NOAA models, all of 
the NOAA projects, every-
thing that’s led by or host-
ed by NOAA was down. 
The good news is … we 
were able to maintain a lot 
of the data collection that 
is important to NOAA, so 
that once their models 
come back online, we can 
begin to repopulate that 
with data.”
Cardinale 
highlighted 
the impacts of not being 
able to make his organi-
zation’s 
data 
available 
through NOAA’s models. 
As an example, he said the 
CIGLR works with NOAA 
to create and publicize 
ice forecasts on the Great 
Lakes, which are used by 
and can affect the sched-
ules of people in the ship-
ping industry.
When the government 
is shut down, Cardinale 
said, these forecasts are 
not readily available for 
those who rely on them as 
part of their work. Even 

though the data is still be-
ing collected by CIGLR, the 
shutdown leaves Cardinale’s 
organization without access 
to the NOAA models to up-
date them.
“It highlights the impor-
tance of cooperation between 
public organizations like uni-
versities 
and 
government 
agencies,” Cardinale said. “It 
allows for some redundancies 
to occur, so if the government 
agencies go down, public in-
stitutions like our University 
can continue collecting data. 
Now, those models are still 
hosted on the NOAA serv-
ers, so if NOAA goes down 
they’re not available to any-
one, but the good news is we 
can still be collecting data to 
update them when they come 
back online.”
LSA junior Alyssa Cutter 
does research on breast can-
cer and cancer cells in the 
University’s Department of 
Radiology. She said her re-
search is funded in part by 
the National Institutes of 
Health, which has still been 
funded throughout the shut-
down.
For her research, however, 
the shutdown has affected 
grant funding and reviews. 
She said the government 
shutdown hasn’t altered her 
research in its current state 
but the shutdown’s impact 
will be felt further down the 
road.

In October, Daley discov-
ered the Michigan Union 
and Office of Procurement 
have begun the process of 
accepting bids for vendors. 
Daley said she was concerned 
because of the Union’s lack of 
transparency regarding the 
bids.
Kim Broekhuizen, Univer-
sity Public Affairs spokes-
woman, 
described 
the 
bidding process, which last-
ed from Oct. 24 to Dec. 31. 
Broekhuizen expects final 
selections to be made “soon”.
“The University is engaged 
in a competitive bid process 
for thee spots in the Michigan 
Union for fast food-casual 
restaurants,” the Broekhui-
zen wrote. “A team comprised 
of U-M students as well as 
employees from Procurement 
Services, University Unions 
and Auxiliary Services is cur-
rently evaluating the bids and 
will likely make selections 
for the three spots in the next 
few months.”
Daley said she wants more 
information and greater stu-
dent involvement in the proj-
ect.
“It is a completely hid-
den process,” Daley said. “So 
there is no feedback being 
accepted from the commu-
nity or students so it is very 
difficult to tell people what 
you think; they won’t even 
tell anybody if Wendy’s sub-
mitted a bid.”
Daley 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
community 
interaction in deciding which 
organizations 
should 
be 
placed in the building.
“The 
Union 
is 
going 
through this bidding process 
with no mechanism of getting 
feedback,” Daley said. “And 
also not communicating with 
most of the student body and 
most of the community about 
which corporations to work 
with to sell students things 
and sell people things in the 

Union.”
The Michigan Union Board 
of Representatives is a stu-
dent organization working 
with Union administrators 
consulting on various aspects 
of the renovation. One of the 
students sits on the Selection 
Committee for the vendors, 
but the members of the com-
mittee are not known.
“At least one of these stu-
dents sit on this board, but I 
don’t think this is an accurate 
representation of the student 
body and the community,” 
Daley said.
Daley 
emphasized 
the 
importance of student voices 
speaking out against Wendy’s 
coming to U-M.
“We are basically trying 
to pressure this corporation 
who has a lot of power in the 
amount of money they spend 
on produce to be able to put 
pressure to make working 
conditions for farmworkers 
in the United state better,” 
Daley said.
Daley said the community 
cannot know who submit-
ted bids by the Dec. 31 dead-
line without submitting a 
Freedom Of Information Act 
request. The organization has 
made a motion to the Michi-
gan Board of Representatives 
and is working with CSG to 
create a resolution to ban 
Wendy’s from campus.
With the University as one 
of the largest employers in 
Michigan, the University’s 
actions can impact every 
resident. As a result, Daley 
said, the decision of vendors 
should be chosen transpar-
ently with community feed-
back.
“Students spend thousands 
of dollars on tuition and if 
the University is going to be 
making money on vendors in 
the basement of the Union, 
then members of the commu-
nity and the Michigan Family 
should have a say in what goes 
there.” Daley said. “(Vendors) 
should fall in line with our 
values as a community and to 
not have that ability to share 

or even comment or provide 
feedback at all, is not trans-
parent and I think that’s real-
ly problematic because the 
power the University holds 
over the community.”
Rather than signing on 
to the Fair Food Program, 
Wendy’s has created their 
own code of conduct meant 
to be equal to the Fair Food 
Program. According to Daley, 
this code is not mandatory 
and only suggested in the 
United States and Canada.
“Wendy’s still purchases 
some amount of tomatoes 
from Mexico and there is 
no legal ground for them to 
enforce any of their code of 
conduct,” Daley said. “There 
are reports every year to 
show the changes that have 
been made in the field based 
on the program and there 
isn’t anything that Wendy’s 
has provided at all about 
their non-mandatory code of 
conduct.”
In response to The Daily, 
Wendy’s communication rep-
resentative 
Heidi 
Schauer 
released a statement say-
ing the former restaurant on 
campus was independently 
owned and will not be renew-
ing their lease.

“The Wendy’s restaurant 
on campus was indepen-
dently owned and operated 
by a franchisee,” the Schauer 
wrote. “As a brand we were 
happy to have been part of the 
University of Michigan com-
munity, but I understand that 
our franchisee’s lease expired 
when the school remodeled 
the building in which the res-
taurant was housed, and they 
made the decision not to pur-
sue a new lease.”
Schauer emphasized the 
company’s commitment to 
responsible business prac-
tices.
“We will continue to work 
to bring greater transparency 
to our supply chain practices 
and only the best, highest 
quality products to our cus-
tomers.”

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
The University ceased all non-emergency operations until 7 a.m. Friday, leaving the campus empty 
and deserted.

There’s just a lack 
of understanding 
that everybody 
needs to play a role 
in helping people, 
making sure that 
everyone is safe.

Under the interim policy, students 
wishing to resolve cases of sexual 
misconduct have two options: tradi-
tional investigative resolution, which 
involves now an in-person hearing, 
or adaptable resolution. An adapt-
able resolution must be voluntary 
on part of both the claimant and the 
respondent and must be approved by 
the Title IX coordinator. If the case is 
successfully resolved, the respondent 
does not incur a disciplinary record.
In an email to the Daily, Erik Wes-
sel, director of the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution, explained how 
contrary to longstanding mispercep-
tions, adaptable resolution is not the 
same as mediation.
“In fact, what is now described 
as adaptable resolution (formerly 
alternative resolution) is both a philo-
sophical framing which seeks to hold 
accountable those creating harm and 
support the process for repairing 
harm and a spectrum of voluntary 
resolution options that are focused 
on meeting needs and repairing 
harm,” Wessel wrote.
Adaptable resolution has been 
available under the SSMP since the 
August 2013 iteration of the policy, 
but it has been referred to in policies 
prior to 2019 as “alternative resolu-
tion” and “informal resolution”. One 
goal of the 2019 interim policy is to 
establish the title of the resolution as 
“adaptable resolution”.
According to Wessel, the 2019 
interim policy also seeks to more 
explicitly describe the types of 

options available under adaptable 
resolution. These options, which 
have remained the same since 2013, 
include various mediation methods 
with a trained adaptable resolution 
coordinator.
Facilitated dialogues and restor-
ative circles are facilitated in-per-
son conversations between those 
involved in which parties share 
their perspective and work toward 
a shared agreement. Alternatively, 
shuttle negotiation does not require 
direct interaction between par-
ties; instead, parties negotiate an 
agreement by meeting individually 
with the coordinator. The circle of 
accountability focuses on support 
and education of the respondent 
when the respondent has assumed 
responsibility for repairing harm and 
does not require the participation of 
the claimant.
According to Dana Elger in an 
email to The Daily, the University’s 
Public Affairs representative for 
sexual misconduct, the new 2019 
interim policy is the latest in a series 
of revisions. The 2013 policy origi-
nally prohibited the use of adaptable 
resolution, then called informal reso-
lution, in any sexual assault cases. 
Informal resolution was first broad-
ened by the 2016 policy, which used 
the term alternative resolution and 
specifically barred mediation in any 
sexual assault case.
“(The 2016 SSMP) did not specifi-
cally state that alternative resolution 
other than mediation was not avail-
able in any sexual assault cases, but 
that was our practice and I believe 
the language from that policy could 
be and often was reasonably inter-
preted that way,” Elger wrote.

Adaptable resolution was further 
revised in the February 2018 SSMP, 
which only prohibited use of media-
tion in respect to penetrative sexual 
assault. The newest January 2019 
iteration fully expanded the pathway, 
allowing for the use of any adaptable 
resolution method on any sexual 
misconduct case, regardless of the 
nature of conflict alleged.
Public Policy senior Allison Berry 
is a Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center volunteer who 
studies sexual violence preven-
tion policy. According to Berry, the 
expansion of adaptable resolution is 
a positive change, as it offers more 
options to survivors.
“I think (adaptable resolution) 
allows the opportunity for the survi-
vor to ask for what they need,” Berry 
said. “It shows that the University 
wants to provide claimants with the 
resources and the support that they 
want. … It’s opening the door for all 
different kinds of survivors who have 
unique needs to have their needs met 
by the University.”
Similarly, 
Engineering 
senior 
Courtney Burns, a SAPAC volunteer 
and Sexperteam education chair, 
said adaptable resolutions could 
empower survivors in ways investi-
gative resolutions sometimes cannot.
“The adaptable resolution process 
allows the survivor to have more 
agency to decide how they want 
their case resolved,” Burns said. “It 
is a welcome step forward in the pro-
cess of enabling survivors of sexual 
violence to feel empowered. A lot of 
the adaptable resolution pathway is 
enabling a conversation between the 
claimant and the respondent where 
the respondent learns and assumes 

responsibility for their actions. … 
That can provide a form of closure 
that the investigative process per-
haps cannot as oftentimes those 
processes are not successful in the 
claimant’s favor.”
By providing more resolution 
options, University President Mark 
Schlissel said in an interview with 
The Daily earlier this month that the 
University hopes more students will 
be encouraged to report sexual mis-
conduct.
“The hope is by providing the sec-
ond pathway, students who did not 
want to come forward and expose 
themselves to a hearing might come 
forward and say, ‘Yeah, I’d like to 
consider this other way of getting 
justice here,’ a more negotiated way 
to get justice,” Schlissel said. “By 
offering that as an option, we’ll get 
more students to step forward and 
ask for help.”
According to Kaaren Williamsen 
in an email to The Daily, director of 
SAPAC, revisions of the policy were 
motivated by student feedback.
“Student requests for adaptable 
resolution also influenced the expan-
sion of the policy,” Williamsen wrote. 
“We know that not all survivors 
want to initiate an investigation and 
adjudication process, but do want 
some assistance in addressing what 
happened to them. The policy now 
allows for more survivors to request 
assistance and intervention beyond 
an investigation and hearing.”
Since its implementation in 2013, 
adaptable resolution has only been 
used in two cases out of the 580 total 
cases from July 2013 to June 2018 
deemed to fall under the scope of the 
SSMP. According to KC Johnson, 

Brooklyn College history professor, 
one reason behind this statistic may 
be bureaucratic.
“Certainly you can infer from 
those figures that Title IX bureau-
cracy at Michigan is not encouraging 
students to pursue this alternative 
pathway,” Johnson said. “And then 
the other question is, how much this 
is disseminated on campus? Students 
do not pursue (adaptable resolution) 
if they do not know it exists.”
Burns also testified to a general 
need for more education of sexual 
misconduct awareness and of Uni-
versity sexual misconduct policy.
“I think the general student body 
isn’t particularly well-equipped with 
the knowledge of what it would look 
like after a sexual violence case is 
reported to the University,” Burns 
said. “Every student goes through 
Relationship Remix when they 
arrive at the University. However, 
when they’re off-campus, it becomes 
more challenging to keep adminis-
tering dosages of sexual violence pre-
vention and resolution education.”
Burns explained more work needs 
to be done, particularly at the College 
of Engineering.
“As an engineering student, most 
of my professors either don’t know 
what SAPAC is or are not trauma-
informed if a survivor were to come 
forward,” 
Burns 
said. 
“SAPAC 
doesn’t have a big presence on North 
Campus.”
Johnson said to his knowledge, no 
other schools have implemented an 
adaptable resolution policy as com-
prehensive and formalized as the 
University’s.
“It’s particularly positive that (a 
policy like adaptable resolution) is 

coming from Michigan because it’s 
a high-profile institution,” Johnson 
said. “If the program succeeds at 
Michigan, it could be a model for lots 
of other institutions. It has potential. 
Maybe it will just fizzle out if no stu-
dents will use it … But if the Univer-
sity finds a way to channel students 
into this, the literature on restorative 
justice suggests that for some stu-
dents, this is the best option.”
In response to Johnson’s claim 
that the University may be taking the 
lead on using alternative methods 
in dealing with sexual misconduct, 
Wessel reaffirmed the University’s 
core purpose as a place of education.
“The University of Michigan is 
indeed at the forefront in providing 
fair, just, equitable and adaptable 
resolution options for our commu-
nity,” Wessel wrote. “Indeed, we are 
educators — and this is how we sup-
port our community while fulfilling 
both missions of education and com-
pliance.”
Wessel also said many students 
may still not be aware of the new pol-
icy and explained the University is 
always looking for community input.
“Although the policy change has 
been communicated to the commu-
nity, we understand that many would 
not have read through the nuance of 
the policy,” Wessel said. “That said, 
it should be noted that the policy 
was intentionally implemented as 
an interim policy to comply with the 
ruling of the Sixth Circuit. We will be 
engaging the University community 
as we seek to draft a finalized policy 
in the coming months. A process for 
seeking community input is current-
ly in development and will begin to 
roll out in February and March.”

people need to understand 
that the agencies can’t do it 
all, that people, individuals 
need to interact with anyone 
they feel might be in danger 
and not be afraid to ask 
them if they’re ok, if they’re 
safe because safety is not 
guaranteed, 
especially 
during the extreme situation 
that we’re in right now.”
On Monday, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer declared a state 
of emergency and released 
a press release stating the 
concern she has for the 
upcoming temperatures.
“Such 
widespread, 
extreme 
conditions 
have 
not occurred in Michigan 
for many years and it is 
imperative 
that 
we 
are 
proactive 
with 
record-
low 
temperatures 
being 
predicted by the National 
Weather Service,” Whitmer 
wrote. 
“Wind 
chills 
are 
predicted 
as 
low 
as 
50 
degrees 
below 
zero 
in 
many places, such as metro 
Detroit, which is especially 
unaccustomed 
to 
these 
temps.”
In 
Washtenaw 
County, 
there 
have 
been 
efforts 
by cities, local homeless 
shelter 
communities 
and 
students to aid the homeless 
population during this 
time of extreme cold. 
Kurtz said even after the 
extreme 
temperatures 
subsided, 
obstacles 
would remain for people 
affected 
by 
housing 
insecurity.
“I think it’s a shame 
that 
it 
takes 
a 
pure 
emergency 
situation 
such as this to have the 
shelter and the warming 
center 
extend 
their 
hours,” Kurtz said. “A 
safe indoor space should 
be available all seasons, 
all hours to anyone who 
lacks stability and there 
are 
times 
during 
the 
winter when the severe 
weather goes away and 
people are still going to be 
exposed to incredibly not 
only uncomfortable but 
unsafe temperatures.”
Daniel 
Kelly, 
executive 
director 
of 
the Shelter Association 
of 
Washtenaw 
County, 
said their center is taking 
additional 
precautions 
to 
host more people during the 
cold nights and days this 
coming week. 
“With 
record 
low 
temperatures, we are trying 
to accommodate as many 
bodies as we can. We have a 
residential shelter program 
that houses 50 beds, and our 
warming centers house 118 
individuals,” Kelly said. “We 

are converting our on-site 
community kitchen to more 
beds at the Delonis Center 
and are aiding operation of 
rotating shelters at faith-
based congregations.”
Kelly 
also 
mentioned 
the city of Ann Arbor and 
Washtenaw 
County 
have 
been crucial partners in 
expanding their outreach 
efforts for this particular 
week.
“Tomorrow 
we 
have 
additional 
off-site 
and 
overnight warming spaces at 
Ann Arbor Public Schools,” 
Kelly said. “Just for the next 
couple of nights, we’ll be able 
to house more folks in their 
gym. We set up those types 
of precautions especially for 
extreme weather situations 
such as these.”
Kelly 
explained 
that 
many homeless individuals 
don’t 
feel 
comfortable 
coming to shelters, but that 
the Shelter Association is 
working 
in 
partnership 
with 
Washtenaw 
County 
Community Mental Health, 
an 
organization 
that 
sustains relationships with 
and provides mental health 
services to the homeless 
population in Washtenaw 
County. They are tasked with 
guiding 
and 
encouraging 
those on the street to seek 
shelter and helping them 
find transportation.

The Robert J. Delonis 
Center, a homeless shelter 
in Ann Arbor, has developed 
a transportation option in 
response to an unsheltered 
emergency 
after 
5 
p.m. 
on 
weekdays 
and 
on 
weekends. This additional 
winter 
response 
is 
for 
homeless individuals who 
lack transportation to the 
overnight warming center 
the Delonis Center.
Students 
on 
campus 

are also helping the local 
homeless 
population 
in 
light of this week’s weather. 
Public 
Health 
senior 
Hussain Ali, co-president 
of Michigan Movement, has 
been gathering supplies and 
donating 
warm 
clothing 
items and food with a group 
of 15 other students to 
various homeless shelters 
around 
Ann 
Arbor 
on 
Tuesday. 
On 
Wednesday, 
five 
students 
who 
have 
access to cars will be driving 
around 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 
offering rides to shelter to 
the homeless on the street.
“Michigan 
Movement’s 
main mission is to provide 
aid and relief to people 
experiencing homelessness 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 
Washtenaw 
County. 
This 
week, our major concern is 
getting anyone who doesn’t 
have shelter in an area of 
heat for the day and/or 
night,” Ali said.
Other students on campus 
are 
sharing 
emergency 
helplines to call if someone 
on the street is in need 
of 
housing. 
LSA 
senior 
Catherine 
Szkop 
saw 
that friends were sharing 
numbers for various shelters 
on their Instagram stories 
and so she decided to share 
the Ann Arbor helpline.
“I got the Ann Arbor 
number just by looking on 
Google and the Detroit 
numbers - someone else 
had on their story so I 
just screenshotted it and 
posted it on mine,” Szkop 
said. “I think sharing 
information 
through 
social media allows it to 
spread faster especially 
since more often than 
not, your friends check it 
multiple times a day. It’s 
more efficient and more 
likely to reach a wider 
audience to put a number 
for a warming center on 
my Instagram story than 
another method.”
Ali said in addition to 
calling the helpline for 
someone on the street, 
people should also let 
them know where to find 
warming shelters.
“The 
first 
step 
if 
someone is outside is to 
call the Delonis Center or 
let them know that there 
is food and shelter there. 
The major importance is 
that everyone is safe from 
the bitter cold during the 
night and day,” Ali said.
Kurtz called on people 
to reach out to one another 
and address the problem of 
housing instability. 
“There’s 
just 
a 
lack 
of 
understanding 
that 
everybody needs to play 
a role in helping people, 
making sure that everyone 
is safe,” Kurtz said.

 AT RISK

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

M

ore than four years 
since the start of the 
Flint 
water 
crisis, 

thousands of residents still have 
lead pipes. Flint is in the process of 
finding and replacing those pipes, 
but it is challenging. City records 
are spotty, making locating at-risk 
homes somewhat of a shot in the 
dark. However, simply digging up 
all the lines in the city would be 
costly and time-consuming.

This is where the computer 

scientists come in — specifically 
Eric Schwartz of the University 
of Michigan and Jacob Abernathy 
of Georgia Tech (formerly of the 
University). The two assistant 
professors designed a machine 
learning model to predict where 
lead pipes are most likely to be in 
Flint using digitized city records 
as well as property data such as 
age and location. The Flint pipe 
replacement team was able to 
achieve 
above 
an 
80-percent 

success rate for finding lead pipes in 
2017 with this model.

The problem is Flint stopped 

using it. Due to misconceptions 
about 
predictive 
models, 
the 

strategy of prioritizing at-risk 
homes was abandoned. Residents 
questioned why their neighbor’s 
pipes were being excavated while 
theirs received no attention. City 
council members asked the same 
thing about their wards. Facing 
mounting political pressure, Flint 
adopted the approach of excavating 
the pipes of every active water 
account (without prioritization).

The 
misconceptions 
don’t 

seem to be limited to those without 
a 
technical 
background. 
The 

international 
engineering 
firm 

hired to execute the pipe-removal 
project, 
AECOM, 
explained 

they aren’t using the model to 
prioritize homes because it is “94 
percent accurate” — an especially 
puzzling statement considering the 
alternative is to dig and hope.

This 
change 
to 
a 
non-

prioritized approach has resulted 
in an accuracy rate of 15 percent 
for finding lead pipes. That is a 
pretty damning statistic when 
you consider that, while using the 

predictive model, the replacement 
team was achieving an accuracy 
rate above 80 percent. I agree that 
every Flint resident deserves the 
peace of mind of knowing that their 
home doesn’t contain lead pipes. 
The situation in Flint has been far 
too dire for anything else. However, 
the city failing to prioritize those 
most at-risk is not acceptable — 
especially when they have a proven 
option which can help them do just 
that.

Poor decisions like the one 

described 
above 
will 
become 

commonplace 
if 
tech-illiteracy 

among decision makers remains 
the 
status 
quo. 
Members 
of 

Congress 
have 
demonstrated 

their incompetence on tech issues 
repeatedly this year, with hearings 
intended to hold tech companies 
accountable devolving into basic 
explanations of how Facebook and 
Google make money and other 
questions that could be answered 
by using your favorite search 
engine (Google perhaps?).

In order to best serve their 

constituents, policymakers should 
be prioritizing getting informed 
about the basics of technology 
and the tech industry at large. 
Facebook, Google, Amazon and the 
like are no longer scrappy upstarts 
carving a place for themselves 
in the economy. They have their 
hands in a wide range of sectors 
such as entertainment, health 
care and defense and are the most 
valuable companies in the world. 
Until they are treated as the giants 
of industry that they are, we risk 
allowing unchecked externalities 
to run their course.

Furthermore, aside from the 

industry giants’ reach, technology 
is everywhere. Our digital age 
ensures that whatever issue a 
policymaker cares about most, 
whether it’s the financial industry 
or the justice system, has pressing 
questions involving the use of 
technology. 
Understanding 
the 

basics will help all legislators better 
tackle the problems they care about 
most.

I don’t expect politicians to 

become subject matter experts on 
technology. That’s not productive 
or feasible. However, a baseline 
understanding 
of 
the 
most 

prevalent use cases is a worthwhile 
goal. 
Such 
an 
understanding 

would help policymakers more 
effectively 
address 
constituent 

concerns 
and 
confusion, 
like 

what city officials faced in Flint. 
Technology that truly improves the 
lives of citizens could be identified 
and prioritized. Decision makers 
could ask the right questions about 
companies and their technology. 
Our representatives are expected 
to understand the basics of health 
care because it affects every citizen. 
Shouldn’t they understand the 
basics of technology for the very 
same reason?

The 
narrative 
that 
tech 

companies 
are 
motivated 
by 

altruistic 
sensibilities 
has 

been proven to be clearly and 
demonstrably false by now. They 
are driven by profit just like any 
other company. The tech industry’s 
promise of self-governance and a 
wave of public benefits has proven 
to be unrealistic, and it is now the 
responsibility of our legislators 
to represent the best interests 
of citizens when it comes to 
technology.

Unfortunately 
for 
Flint 

residents, their leaders’ lack of tech 
knowledge has led to yet another 
misstep in the city’s long running 
saga. We can only hope other 
policymakers take note before they 
make similar mistakes.

Another lesson to be learned from Flint

What is good and bad masculinity?

S

ince I was eight years old, my 

teachers and parents warned 

me to avoid the types of clothing 

that revealed my feminine features 

because men on the streets, uncles 

who visit my house and even young 

boys in my class might be provoked 

to take advantage of me. I grew up in 

a society where a man’s testosterone-

driven malignancy was rarely decried 

when rape crimes flashed on the 

news. Instead, the news vilified the 

women who were victims for wearing 

outfits that unveiled more legs than 

necessary and blamed them for 

“asking for it.”

I perceived the link between 

sexual assault, abusive power and 

a man’s gender identity as a South 

Asian, sociocultural phenomenon 

— until I attended a multicultural 

boarding school in Italy where the 

male teachers sexually harassed 

their female students, and the only 

physical violence that happened 

in two years was between men, or 

a man towards a woman. When 

I came to the United States for 

college, my friends and I were 

groped on dark dance floors at 

frat parties. During my vacations 

to France and Los Angeles, men 

from all over sent me catcalls. My 

girlfriends and I were verbally 

abused when we rejected men who 

pursued us at bars. I witnessed 

the toxic elements of a universal 

framework of masculinity built on 

the historical social dominance that 

gives men a license to abuse, violate 

and sexually mistreat members of 

the opposite sex.

But I cannot theorize the 

boorish behavior as the essential 

nature of manhood because I have 

seen the more righteous sides of it 

as well. I was raised by my father 

— 
a 
non-violent, 
affectionate, 

masculine paternal figure — who 

continues to sacrifice his own 

comfort to provide for me. He 

always respected my mother and 

reprimanded family members who 

treated females as subordinates. 

Many men — not just my father— in 

my life have been compassionate, 

caring and respectful.

This new year, the topic of 

masculinity 
has 
wrecked 
the 

internet 
with 
raging 
debates. 

In early January, the American 

Psychological 
Association 

published its first-ever guidelines 

for therapists working with men 

and boys, in order to address the 

concerning fact that men are 

more often the perpetrators and 

the victims of violence, and also 

comprise the larger demographic in 

suicide rates.

Though the study draws from 

four decades of research (long 

before the #MeToo era) and is 

intended to better men’s physical 

and mental health, it has still 

been opposed as “anti-men” for 

concluding that perceptions of 

“traditional 
masculinity” 
(such 

as suppressing emotions and not 

seeking help) can have potential 

harmful effects on men and people 

around them.

A week later, Gillette released 

a 
commercial 
critiquing, 
“the 

particular brand of masculinity” 

by which some men feel they are 

allowed to commit various acts 

of harassment such as bullying, 

groping and catcalling. This ad was 

met with furious backlash from 

men’s rights activists and many 

others, including women, who 

have been seriously offended that 

the phrase “toxic masculinity” has 

branched out from the confines 

of gender studies classrooms and 

entered our personal lives where 

we can actually address it.

In response to the Gillette ad 

that garnered 1.3 million dislikes 

to date, Egard Watches released a 

commercial that has been received 

without the same fury because it 

positively frames men’s bravery and 

doesn’t display some of the more 

problematic aspects of masculinity. 

Similar to the APA guidelines, 

the ad made note of the fact that 

men make up the overwhelming 

majority of homicide victims. The 

two commercials and the APA 

guidelines essentially agree that 

men are inherently righteous and 

the deplorable, abusive behavior 

does not portray “real men.” The 

fundamental difference is that 

unlike Egard Watches, Gillette 

and APA expose the detrimental 

aspects of socialized masculinity in 

order to prevent them. Both of these 

messages are equally important.

If young boys are only shown 

that courageous men have sacrificed 

their lives to end wars, they won’t 

learn that men engaging in “locker 

room talk” is dishonorable. We 

seem to not realize that condemning 

certain damaging actions in order 

to eradicate them is just as vital as 

praising positive, virtuous conduct 

so as to encourage its adaptations. 

While we should highlight the 

model of masculinity that entails 

the selfless and commendable, we 

also need to discuss and dismantle 

the 
problematic 
archetype 
of 

masculinity that, time after time, 

perpetuates a crude culture of 

entitlement that far too often leads 

to abuse and violence. While social 

media struggles with what it means 

to be a man, one constructive 

message is clear: Bullying and 

sexual 
violence 
are 
not 
key 

characteristics of a man’s identity. 

So, it’s time to start denouncing the 

bad behavior as well as positively 

reinforcing good behavior.

“Brooklyn Nine-Nine” actor 

Terry Crews has emphasized the 

necessity of this call to action and 

said: “Until men stand up and say, 

‘This abuse, this harassment, these 

assaults are wrong,’ nothing will 

change.” And this is crucial because 

men do not always hold each other 

accountable for bad behavior, even 

when they see it or know about it. Of 

course, there are men who do, but it 

is not as commonplace as it should 

be. For example, when a male friend 

of mine warned one man to stop his 

pernicious insistence on sex with a 

drunk woman, he was criticized by 

other men for being “unchilled.”

Similarly, when my female 

friend was sexually assaulted by 

her Tinder date who ignored all 

the “Nos,” her male best friend 

responded, “I’m sorry but you 

cannot just walk into a strange 

man’s house and expect everything 

to be alright.” If a 21-year-old, 

college man utters such words, 

it demonstrates the fallacious 

mentality that presumes an innate 

bridge 
connecting 
masculinity, 

sexual assault and fear. But that 

dynamic should not exist because 

a society where a woman has to 

fear an unfamiliar man but a man 

can violate an unknown woman is 

simply unfair. When another man 

in the same friend circle learned 

of this comment, he claimed it 

was thoroughly disrespectful. Yet, 

he failed to warn his male friend 

who blamed the victim because 

they have a “guy code” where 

rebuking each other’s wrongs 

rhymes with “uncool” negativity. 

But negativity is not calling each 

other out on sexist comments or 

bullying, it’s the destructive words 

and actions itself. Hence, men need 

to administer conversations about 

sexual assault awareness with their 

“bros” and deliver warnings when 

required.

And yes, men are not the 

only ones behind social problems 

because women can also be guilty of 

harassment, bullying and violence. 

Women unquestionably share the 

responsibility for ensuring the 

community is safe for all. Yet, even 

up until 2015, rape prevention tips 

were mostly directed to women 

and not men. Discourse on sexual 

politics 
is 
progressing. 
That’s 

why this current dialogue on 

masculinity is a good sign that 

we can now start decomposing 

any 
association 
between 
a 

man’s gender identity and abuse 

of power and violence. So to 

everyone reading this — especially 

men — I urge you to hold yourselves 

and 
your 
friends 
accountable 

for harmful behavior. If this is 

something you uphold, continue to 

do so. But if you don’t, it’s time to 

start now.

W

hen 
it 
comes 
to 

media bias, many of 
my peers scoff at the 

idea that the political media is 
somehow coloring their opinions 
of the most contentious political 
issues today. Most of us want to 
believe we are coming to the most 
logical conclusions when it comes 
to the formation of our opinions. 
However, those of us deeply 
concerned about media bias feel the 
problem is so obvious and impactful 
that we aren’t sure how anyone can 
deny its reality anymore.

While the problem exists in the 

headlines on a daily basis, it was 
no more apparent than this past 
week as two of the nation’s most 
contentious protests — The 46th 
Annual March for Life and the 
third annual Women’s March — 
took to the streets of Washington, 
D.C. Many mainstream media 
outlets on the right and left are 
guilty of portraying the version 
of events that fit a predictable 
ideological narrative, but since 
several mainstream media outlets 
are decidedly left-leaning, liberal 
political sentiments often pop 
up much more often on social 
media timelines as well as in TV 
and print news. CNN, MSNBC, 
the Huffington Post, the Atlantic 
and The New York Times often 
all face criticism by conservatives 
for coming across as left-leaning 
news outlets. They proved these 
criticisms accurate with their 
coverage of these marches.

While 
I 
initially 
thought 

analyzing headlines from all of 
these sources would be a beneficial 
undertaking, I quickly realized 
delving into the full breadth of 
media bias would take a much 
more in-depth analysis than I am 
capable of providing in this space. 
So instead, I chose to analyze just 
one of these sources, The New York 
Times, to see how their coverage of 
the two political protests from this 
past week varied in both quality 

and quantity. I chose The New 

York Times over the others due to 
the prevalence with which I feel 
my peers tend cite its credibility 
and due to the amount I consume 
articles from The New York Times 
over other sources as well. I find 
that compared to very openly 
biased sources on the right and left 
— like Fox News and the Huffington 
Post, respectively — The New 

York Times is substantially more 
balanced in general, though I was 
disappointed with their coverage 
of these two marches this past 
week.

The New York Times coverage 

of the March for Life featured 
three news stories on the day 
of the march itself but had no 
articles in the days preceding. 
The first search result on their 
website was titled, “Thousands 
March in Washington at Annual 
Anti-Abortion 
Rally.” 
I 
was 

immediately incredulous that an 
article reporting on a march that 
has existed for 46 years and this 
year collected nearly 100,000 
participants neglected to even call 
the march by its name. Rather, 
it referred to it by the politically 
charged characterization of being 
“Anti-Abortion.” By doing so, 
the headline already painted a 
negative picture in the minds of 
the reader. Not inconsequentially, 
the organizers of the March for 
Life portray their own message 
as positive. They don’t claim to 
be marching against abortion 
but rather marching for life. 
While this may seem like mere 
semantics, anyone well-versed 
in persuasive writing tactics 
understands 
positive 
versus 

negative 
persuasive 
language 

has a very strong effect on a 
reader 
both 
consciously 
and 

subconsciously.

Additionally, by the second 

paragraph, the article had shifted 
into a long tangent surrounding 
the government shutdown and 
President 
Donald 
Trump. 
It 

continued with a macabre tone 
as it delved into the difference 
in the climate of Washington 
this year versus the last due to 
the shutdown. It finally circled 
back to the march itself by the 
last paragraph, still without any 
substantive coverage of the details 
of what people were marching for 
or the history of the event itself, 
ending on a note about failed 
Republican attempts at anti-
abortion legislation under Trump.

The other two articles also 

both featured headlines about 
Trump instead of talking about 
the march more substantively. 
While this may not appear on 
its face to be the boldest form 
of media bias, the reporters at 
The New York Times neglected 

to report on any of the pro-life 
perspectives provided at the 
march or even to detail the sheer 
mass 
of 
pro-life 
supporters 

from all walks of life who were 
in 
attendance. 
Instead, 
they 

continually turned the discussion 
back to Trump’s presidency with 
only occasional blips of reporting 
about the march itself.

The New York Times coverage 

of the third annual Women’s 
March varied substantially from 
its coverage of the March For 
Life. There were five total articles 
posted on the day of the march 
itself and another six articles 
were posted about the march in 
the preceding days. While the 
title of the first search result from 
the day, “Smaller Crowd Turns 
Out For Third Annual Women’s 
March Events,” did not initially 
inspire optimism, the article 
did boast the accomplishment 
of actually calling the march by 
its name. It also discussed the 
march with substance. Instead 
of depicting Washington as “a 
capital full of shuttered federal 
agencies” as the article about 
the March for Life did before 
delving into veiled criticism of 
President Trump, it began to 
discuss the positive aspects of 
this year’s march despite the low 
turnout, noting how “throngs 
of marchers” arrived with their 
“spirits visibly lifted.” The article 
went on to tout the march as a 
“celebration” of all that had been 
accomplished in women’s rights 
in the previous year — utilizing 
the type of positive language that 
was notably absent throughout 
the piece written about the March 
for Life. It did then go onto to 
discuss the controversy around 
alleged anti-Semitic comments 
made by two of the organizers of 
the march, however, noting how 
this fractured the movement as 
a whole and contributed to the 
decreased turnout. While this 
was most definitely an example of 
balanced reporting, it by no means 
excuses The New York Times of the 
disproportionate level of coverage 
given to the Women’s March versus 
the March for Life.

How big of a problem is biased political journalism?

The Huron River

It’s July in Michigan: A roasting 
sun hangs high over the Huron 
River while lazy, college students 
stretch out on the rowing docks. 
They sip on Oberons and blow up 
inner tubes. The river is murky, but 
it still glistens in the sunlight and 
is a temperature that is just perfect 
enough for a swim. Ann Arbor 
wouldn’t be Ann Arbor without 
this place.
Located two miles from the 
Diag are the well-known docks 

of the Huron River. Home to the 
University’s and many Ann Arbor 
high-school rowing teams, the 
docks are a vital place for these 
students. Surrounding this spot on 
the river are parks like Bandemer 
Park, Longshore Park and Beckey 
Park. Here, people can access 
hiking trails, kayak rentals, bike 
paths, disc golf and serene woods.
But what makes the Huron 
River special is not just the array 
of activities that it produces, but 
rather the magic of the river itself. 
Flowing over 40 miles, dressed 
with trees and roads along its 
edges, the river invites those who 
are tied to the city to escape. This 
lure is what led me to rely on the 
river in order to get some peace of 
mind.
I started going to the docks as 
a break from my summer job, for 
it served as a place to tan, swim 
and catch up with friends. But as 
summer turned into fall and long, 
breezy days turned into brisk nights 
with tough deadlines, the magic of 
the river and summer faded.
One night in the fall, a close friend 
of mine from the summertime 
needed a private place to vent. We 
both lived with many housemates, 
so we decided to take my car to the 
river to retreat from the hustle and 
bustle of a college 
town. We sat on 
the docks, with 
hats and scarves 
on, and we poured 
our 
frustrations 
into the moonlit 
river. It was here 
where I realized 
how 
easy 
this 
place was, how 
non-judgemental 
it is. Its natural 
emptiness 
and 
simplicity 
allowed for me 
and my friend to 
release all that we 
had bottled up.
The 
river, 
although 
not 
immensely 
clean, 
holds 
an 
emotional 
enchantment that 
I’ve been lucky 
enough 
to 
feel 
and understand. 
It’s a place where 
romantic 
nights 
watching 
the 
stars 
happen 
and where tiresome runs occur. 
Capable of seeing the city lights 
and skyline from the docks, the 
Huron provides a vantage point 
that makes one feel pure isolation: a 
tranquil getaway just close enough 
to home and far enough away to 
gain some perspective.
I’ve 
begun 
to 
bring 
more 
friends to the river when they 
are emotionally distraught. As 
someone who studies and feels 
serenity through nature, I hope 
to show others the power that is 
held in the Huron River and its 
encompassing woods. I hope to 
show them that by merely taking a 
step back from the crowded city — 
by literally seeing it from afar —it 
can put their mind into a better 
state of understanding: hopefully, 
one of peace and relaxation.

Whenever I need to meditate 
on an idea or seek solitude to listen 
to an album, I drive down to the 
river. I watch the push and pull of 
the waves along the shoreline and 
listen to the silence that looms over 
the park. No matter if I run, walk, 
swim, drive or sit down there, I feel 
a natural sense of freedom that the 
city just doesn’t serve.
Although there are a number of 
special, nature-based places that 
Ann Arbor provides (like the Arb 
or the Botanical Gardens), it’s the 
Huron that calls me from the city, 
drawing me into its groundedness 

and vastness, it’s easiness and 
comfort. The Huron serves as a 
nucleus of community, collecting 
Michigan’s 
natural, 
minuscule 
wonders and the people who make 
up this town. Without that river, 
my mind would be suffocated, my 
emotions would be drowning and 
the decisions I’ve made would still 
be unclear.
But the moment I sit on those 
docks under the stars, sipping on an 
Oberon and laughing with a good 
friend, I know that somewhere in 
this constricting city I’ve found a 
place to call home.

Luther Co-op

When I think of my home, I 
think of the floorboards. I think of 
the weight of all the shoes they have 
creaked beneath. I think of every 
place those shoes have journeyed 
to, and how lucky they are to have 
ended up here.
When I think of my home, I 
think of the stains. My home has so 
many stains. I think of the stories 
that caused them. I wonder who 
spilled what, and what they were 
doing when it happened. I wonder 
if anyone was there 
to see the incident. 
I bet someone was. 
My house is always 
full of people. People 
laughing, loving and 
spilling. A perfect 
mess.
When I think of 
my home, I think of 
my bedroom. How 
the ceiling concaves 
into itself because I 
live right below the 
roof. I think of the 
single window, and 
how the light that 
comes from it dances 
with the sun as it sets 
in the evening. My 
own private ballet. 
Feeding the flowers 
my roommate and I 
have gathered over 
time.
When I think of 
my home, I think of 
the porch. I think of 
how silent it is in the 
morning, before the 
wear and tear of the 
day makes it loud. 
I think of how well it pairs with 
coffee; it’s the perfect substitute 
for sugar. I think of all the secrets 
the porch has heard and how well 
those secrets are kept. I wonder 
if it knows any of mine. I think 
of the late August evenings the 
porch has been witness to. Filled 
with strumming guitar strings, 
summer’s favorite lullaby. I wonder 
if the porch has a bedtime. I don’t 
think it does.
I’d like to fall asleep in the 
floorboards of my home. Have the 
aged wood keep me safe. I’d like 
to tattoo the stains onto my skin. 
So if anything’s ever too clean, all 
I have to do is look at my arms to 
be reminded of beautiful messes. 
I’d like to pack my bedroom in a 
suitcase. So I can impress all my 
long distance friends with the 

dancing light. I’d like the porch 
to forgive me when I write one 
of its many secrets on this page: 
The people who live here, leave 
changed.

A place to run

I am struggling to locate my 
favorite place in Ann Arbor. 
Perhaps this is because the whole 
city is my favorite place, it’s ins and 
outs, late night pizza places and 
sticky booths in diners and ancient 

movie theatres and snowy streets. 
Perhaps this is because it is easier 
to associate physical places with 
times of more specific heartbreak, 
instead of the thousands of times I 
am lucky to have felt content here. I 
sometimes think my favorite place 
in Ann Arbor is the dining hall in 
East Quad where I met my best 
friend, the lecture hall where I met 
my boyfriend, the yoga studio I go 
to leave my doubts, surreptitious 
study spots I won’t mention for 
fear they will become less secret, 
newsrooms on Maynard, wooden 
benches in the drama building 
— drowned in pools of sunlight 
coming in from the floor to ceiling 
windows, restaurants on Detroit 
Street. But these places are favorites 
not because of the spaces they 
occupy specifically, but because of 
the people, memories and moments 
I attribute to them.
To think of my true favorite 
place in Ann Arbor, I head toward 
a semblance of something solitary. 
I love to be overwhelmed with 
socialization, with human contact, 
with friends old and new, this 
bubbly and bright outgoing city 
never runs low on energy, but this 
is an Ann Arbor that is in reach, it 
is an Ann Arbor that is easy, it is 
the Ann Arbor I know and love. 
But the reason I fell in love with 
our city was not for the clatter and 
the whirlwind, but for the places 
in which I can find fragmented 
moments of silence. A place to 
rest my mind, a place where I can 
be utterly alone in my thoughts. I 
think of places that are soundless, 
confidential and exclusive. I think 
of places I can revel in the beauty 
and the sentimentality of this town, 
without distractions, without the 
hustle and bustle of a busy college 
campus. These places are rare and 
in short supply around us, with a 
campus crawling with students, 
education 
professionals 
and 
townies. I believe I’ve managed to 
discover the best of all.
People always ask me how I 
managed to train for a marathon in 
Ann Arbor — a city that most people 
imagine can’t be interesting or 
thrilling for 10 mile runs, let alone 
18 or 20 mile runs. But for me, every 
run in Ann Arbor is as present and 
new as morning. My favorite place 
in Ann Arbor is a place where I can 
run.
On mile 16 of a twenty-mile 
workout, I find myself in Nichols 
Arboretum, a place that takes me 
out of this pulsing, bright college 
city and onto a trail. Lush greens 
grow around me, spilling onto the 
edges of the earth and twisting 
up the trunks of trees. My tired 
feet pad along a dirt path one 
after another, a constant. This 
is my favorite noise. Normally, 
as I venture down the Arb’s first 
downward hill, I pause my music, 
giving my ears the gift of nothing 
but my sneakered feet against 
dirt and soil. This is my favorite 
sound of all. Everything about the 
headspace this running sanctuary 
creates for me can completely 
alter my mood, turn a bad day 
into a spectacular one, push me 
toward moments of serendipity in 
the mundane and provide the well 
needed break I so often crave in a 
city that never seems to stop. Ann 

Arbor is a runner’s city and I know 
all runners will agree. Despite the 
fact that many of us don’t leave 
campus much, I have a lot of pride in 
knowing I’ve traversed every inch 
of our Midwestern college town on 
foot. During my marathon training 
I found home in Gallup park’s 
shaded concrete sidewalks, and I 
picked up the pace to the sounds of 
rushing water to my left. I ran into 
people I didn’t know, running the 
opposite direction, and we’d always 
smile and wave — the runner’s nod, 
in solidarity with one another, we 
both get it. I found myself getting 
lost in suburban pockets on the 
edge of town, admiring homes 
and 
appreciating 
unexpected 
downward slopes. As the sun came 
up, I ran around the Big House 
once, twice, three times, watching 
as the sun reflected golden against 
bright maize columns as autumn 
came to a close. I flew down E. 
Liberty as breakfast places opened 
early on Sunday mornings, the air 
smelling of crisped bacon, warm 
maple syrup and mugs of coffee. I 
jogged down the narrow road of 
Kerrytown on Saturdays, watching 
students groggily saunter down the 
roads. I ran through an empty Diag, 
and then an hour and a half and 
twelve miles later, a diag bursting 
with life. I wrote poems in my 
head as I ran down Main Street as 
businesses came to life, spent half 
a 20 mile run and hours in the Arb 
— time passing faster than ever. In 
months that felt like weeks, these 
special running spaces propelled 
me to a start line I’d never imagined 
making it to. And alone in my 
race, as I ran 26.2 miles through 
Detroit and Canada, thousands of 
people cheerings me on, runners 
surrounding me like oxygen. I held 
the memories of my solo adventures 
in Ann Arbor’s runner’s oasis by my 
side.
When I made it to the finish 
line I had so many people to 
thank, so much support around 
me. My mother called me crying, 
my brother jumped up and down, 
reminding me how much I needed 
them to make it to the finish line of 

my first marathon. But the biggest 
thanks of all I owed to the roads 
that led me there, the roads I’ve 
run everyday for three years and 
yet, in their intricacy and beauty, 
manage to show me something new 
every day. The roads of Ann Arbor, 
their stories and their memories, 
their tradition and their kindness, 
always there for me — awaiting me 
to need a break, need solace, need 
to lace up my sneakers and run.

The basement of 
Literati

My life has been marked by one 
constant: the ache of my hands. 
While working on a farm in Oahu, 
Hawaii last summer, my hands 
were named “writing hands.” 
They are inherently and exactly 
that – soft and clean, but aching. 
They eventually blistered and hurt 
in a way that only weeding and 
shoveling can do. After I returned 
home, they returned to their 
familiar, but perpetually aching, 
selves.
Reading is my place of refuge; 
writing 
my 
place 
of 
release. 
These two places are the source 
of the aching. I’ve always kept 
these places of asylum secret. 
Letting people into these places is 
dangerous and scary because they 
are my own.
Release, however, is terrifying. 
I write creative nonfiction. I write 
about what unfolds before my eyes. 
I write about people who’ve raised 
me, who’ve slept in my bed, who’ve 
kept my secrets and who’ve broken 
my heart. My world exists on paper. 
To share with others my perception 

of my own life and who composes it 
terrifies me.
My first year of college was a 
lot of things, but, mostly, it was 
shocking. Everything I knew was 
no longer there — a hard thing to 
grasp for someone 
introverted 
and 
perpetually 
nostalgic. 
My 
childhood 
bedroom 
existed 
only 
on 
some 
weekends, 
and 
otherwise only in 
my memory. The 
bookshelf on my 
bedroom 
wall, 
lined with all of my 
favorite books and 
yellowing journals, 
was empty. The 
books sat under my 
lofted bed, stripped 
of their home. I 
barely looked at 
them. I didn’t touch 
a novel that wasn’t 
assigned and didn’t 
write anything that 
I wasn’t told to.
I was far away 
from myself. Maybe I didn’t know 
this, or maybe I didn’t care. All I 
knew was that it was painful.
My second semester of my 
freshman year I took my first class 
on creative nonfiction. I hadn’t 
considered myself any type of 
writer because I hadn’t written in 
months. I started to write again, 
and to read a little, too. A little 
became a lot, and a lot became 
every waking moment in which I 
wasn’t doing schoolwork.
Almost all of this reading was 
done in the basement of Literati 
Bookstore, on the bench in front of 
the memoirs. On that bench, I read 
a lot of things that I didn’t pay for. I 
still feel guilty. I owe that basement 
a lot. That basement may have 
saved me.
There I found all of my favorite 
writers, the writers who inspire 
my bravest writing because they 
are strong and wonderful and 
heaven-sent: 
Claudia 
Rankine, 

Joan Didion, Melissa Febos, Lidia 
Yuknavitch, Maggie Nelson, Mary 
Karr and Sylvia Plath. There are 
hundreds more, I promise. That 
basement brought their stories to 
me. That basement gave courage 
and wit and intelligence to a lost 
freshman who is now a junior and 
more sure of herself than she ever 
thought she’d be.
On any given Saturday, you 
can find me reading in that 
basement. If I’m not there, I’m 
writing in the coffee shop, likely 
at the table against the window. 
To spend a week without visiting 
that basement gives me a deep, 
unshakeable feeling of forgetting. 
Rightfully so.
Literati made me feel safe during 
a time when I’d forgotten what 
safety was, and continues to do so 
today. That basement is the sun on 
my face in a bleak January. That 
basement has reminded me that I 
am, and always will be, a writer.
Literati, if you’re reading this, 
thank you. Also, I’m sorry. I 
promise I’ll do my best to buy more 
books from now on.

The nook under 
my bed

When I first arrived at the 
University of Michigan, the extent 
of my knowledge of Ann Arbor 
was my dad’s route to the football 
games and his friend’s tailgating 
spot. Back in Grand Rapids, I had 
plenty of places that provided 
my home away from home: The 
Starbucks across the Beltline, the 
backroad path to school, the Meijer 

book section. But when I moved 
to school, I lost those places. All at 
once I was thrown into this new 
home without a place to anchor 
myself. But the one place I felt truly 
comfortable was the nook under 
my bed.
The nook under 
my bed was where 
I sat and listened 
to my “calm songs” 
playlist when the 
first week of school 
was overwhelming. 
The nook under 
my bed was where 
I 
had 
a 
movie 
night 
with 
my 
new 
friends 
on 
a Saturday night 
instead of going 
to a frat. The nook 
under 
my 
bed 
was where I took 
naps in between 
Intro to Ballet and 
PoliSci 
because 
getting all the way 
up to my top bunk 
was way too much 
commitment. The 
nook under my bed 
was where I had deep talks with 
the first best friend I’ve ever really 
had. The nook under my bed is my 
safe space, my calm space, my place.
My nook has everything I 
need: My books and notebooks, 
outlets, chargers, food, water and 
mountains of pillows. Why go 
anywhere else when all I need is 
right here? I don’t have to spend 
money. I don’t have to dress up. I 
don’t have to put makeup on or do 
my hair. The nook under my bed 
takes me for what I am. If I want to 
curl up in my PJs with my hair in a 
towel, my roommate might judge 
me, but my nook certainly won’t.
With having a roommate for the 
first time, it’s comforting having a 
space that’s just mine. The rest of the 
room is a common area, it’s open to 
the public, but under my bed is like 
a separate room. When I hang my 
coats up, I can’t even see the door 
from my desk. When I’m sitting on 
the ground, I’m completely hidden 

from view. Friends stopping by can 
see the whole room — everything is 
on display. They can walk around, 
grab a chair and settle in. But they 
can’t see my nook unless they come 
into the room, they don’t go under 
my bed unless they ask.
In college we are expected to 
be social all the time. Not only to 
be social, but to go out, to party or 
do something Instagram-worthy. 
We are expected to be active every 
Thursday night, Friday night, 
Saturday night, even Sunday night; 
to talk to a million people and forget 
their names the next day. To look 
like we’re having the time of our 
lives when sometimes all we want 
to do is relax in our dorm in the 
comfort of our nook. But sometimes 
it’s okay to stay in, by yourself or 
maybe with a couple friends, all 
sitting under your bed talking or 
watching movies. Sometimes it’s 
okay to not be constantly social. 
Sometimes we just need some alone 
time.
I haven’t been in Ann Arbor long 
enough to establish a special place. 
I don’t have a coffee shop that I

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

In terms of his methods, 
director 
Hirokazu 
Kore-eda 
(“Nobody Knows”) is algebraic. 
His latest film “Shoplifters” 
interrogates every axiom that has 
been used to define family. Is it 
childbirth that makes a mother? 
Does calling someone mom, dad, 
sister or brother automatically 
baptize that person into fulfilling 
the corresponding role? Do these 
titles even encompass all that a 
person actually means to us? Can 
family be chosen, or renegotiated 
or be anything other than an 
unalterable birthright?
At 
the 
same 
time 
that 
Kore-eda 
reevaluates 
these 
supposed axioms, he applies 
selective 
coefficients 
within 
the formula for family drama, 
focusing 
specifically 
on 
the 
effect of poverty. The family 
in 
“Shoplifters” 
consists 
of 
couple Osamu (Lily Franky, 
“The Devil’s Path”) and Nobuyo 
(Sakura Andô, “100 Yen Love”), 
as well as the various dependents 
with whom they share their 
lives: A young boy named Shota 
(Jyo Kairi, “Erased”), a young 
woman 
named 
Aki 
(Mayu 
Matsuoka, “A Silent Voice”), 
Aki’s 
grandmother 
Hatsue 
(Kirin Kiki, “Returner”) and 
the most recent addition to the 
nontraditional family, a young 
girl named Yuri (Miyu Sasaki, 
“Samurai 
Gourmet”). 
The 
nontraditional family is united in 
their shared victimization, each 
one clinging to the bottom rung 
of the economic ladder; they also 
share the burden of finding a way 

to survive in spite of their poverty 
(usually taking the form of the 
titular practice of shoplifting). 
All the while, the constant 
pressure of their precarious 
financial situation threatens to 
erode the unquestionable care 
they have for one another and 
instead compel selfishness.
Other filmmakers would do 
well to pay attention to Kore-
eda’s 
cinematic 
arithmetic, 
especially 
others 
who 
also 
endeavor to tell insightful stories 
about families. It is tempting 
to try to account for each of 
the countless variables that 

shape family dynamics but, as 
“Shoplifters” attests, much more 
rewarding to zero in on a few.
While 
his 
approach 
is 
mathematical, 
Kore-eda’s 
results are poetic. For example, 
he structures his investigation 
of family dynamics in what 
could be described as a series of 
couplets. He pairs off members 
of the nontraditional family and 
devotes to these duos scenes 
like stanzas, each one poignant 
enough to stand alone but each 
one also working together to 
form a more resonant whole. 
And through all these stanzas, 
“Shoplifters” 
speaks 
with 
a 
steady 
tone 
of 
composure, 
inflecting 
characters’s 
exchanges 
with 
unselective 
compassion. As if to say, “So 

what if we shoplift? So what if 
break the rules? We are trying 
to survive. We are trying to take 
care of one another.”
So take, for instance, one 
of the most thoughtful of the 
aforementioned 
couplets: 
the 
relationship between Aki and her 
grandmother. When Yuri wets 
the bed the first night she stays 
with her new family and Aki’s 
grandmother offers to sleep next 
to Yuri, Aki protests, insisting 
on her rightful place beside her 
grandmother. Aki’s jealousy is 
not conveyed as dispassionate 
but rather a childish, touching 
manifestation of fierce love and 
loyalty – a familial dynamic 
too subtle for other directors to 
capture on screen.
Or take the design of a 
recurring set in “Shoplifters”: 
that is, the shabby place this 
nontraditional 
family 
calls 
home. It houses the dregs of 
consumerist capitalism. Every 
room is congested with cheap 
goods, to the point that the scenes 
in this house always border on 
inducing claustrophobia. And 
yet, it is in one of these cluttered 
rooms that Aki’s grandmother 
tends to Yuri’s wounds from her 
abusive upbringing. It is here 
that every member of Yuri’s 
new family strives to reteach 
her what it means to love and be 
loved. It is here that this family 
somehow finds room and reason 
to breathe and continue to live in 
spite of their living conditions.
Take 
any 
scene, 
any 
conversation, 
any 
shot 
in 
“Shoplifters.” Revel in its careful 
calculation and pore over its 
resonant results.

FILM REVIEW

AOI PRO, INC.

When I was in high school, one 
of my composition teacher’s first 
challenges for me was to compose 
a piece for the organ. The organ is 
a notoriously difficult instrument 
for non-keyboardists to compose 
for, and I had little familiarity 
with organ repertoire. As my 
composition teacher and I reviewed 
an early draft of my piece, he said 
something profound; something 
that stuck with me and affected 
how I think about the performance 
arts.
He told me that the hardest part 
of the composition process is not 
generating ideas, or getting ideas 
down on the page; it is the struggle 
between the ideas being conveyed 
and the medium through which 
they are being conveyed. It is not the 
struggle between the mind and the 
blank page, in other words, but it is 
the struggle between the musical 
ideas and the instrument that must 
communicate them.
As 
I’ve 
grown 
older, 
this 
philosophy has influenced how 
I think about art. It has come 
to qualify how I classify “good” 
performance art across genres. This 
art transports the audience member 
past the world of the artform to the 
world of the artwork. The audience’s 
need not focus on any meta realms 
of criticism or analysis; their entire 
focus is captured by the performers 
and the artwork itself.
This past weekend, for example, I 
attended a performance of “Juliet,” 
a retelling of “Romeo and Juliet” 
set in the Great Depression. This 
performance was an unstaged 
reading of the play; it featured actors 
and actresses dressed in normal 
clothing reading from music stands 
and thick black binders.
The 
script 
was 
written/
adapted by Alix Curnow (SMTD 
sophomore), Kellie Beck (SMTD 
sophomore) and Eli Rallo (SMTD 
junior). I will be scoring this play 
this coming month as it moves 
into the Duderstadt Video Studio 
for 
a 
staged, 
choreographed 
production in April. Going into 
the performance, I had read the 
script three or four times, and I was 
quite familiar with the changes the 
playwrights made in adapting the 
script to the Great Depression era.
Yet despite my familiarity, I 
was 
unexpectedly 
touched 
by 
the conclusion of this unstaged 

reading. Though I was skeptical 
at the beginning, I had gotten past 
the limitations of the production 
by the end. I was touched by the 
slew of deaths taking place onstage, 
though the actors and actresses on 
stage were clearly not dying. I was 
no longer distracted by the music 

stands, the lack of costumes, or 
the stage directions being read out 
loud. I had learned to observe the 
production for what it was, not what 
it could be.
I also find that I can judge 
“good” artwork as a performer 
through similar means. These 
past two years, for example, I have 
been a member of the University’s 
Javanese 
Gamelan 
Ensemble. 
The instruments that we play are 
many years old, and few are in very 
good condition. On a couple of the 
instruments, a few keys don’t even 
resonate, instead producing a rather 
pitiable “thud” when struck by the 
mallet.
Though not every instrument 
produces a pure sound, the effect 
of the overall ensemble, at least to 
my ears, is breathtaking. It is like 
nothing I am used to experiencing, 
and yet I find it to be incredibly 
engaging. When we perform, I 
sometimes enter a state of mind 
where the quality of the instruments 
and the sound they produce doesn’t 
matter. I am experiencing the piece 
for what it is, not for what it could 
be.
If this is the defining feature of 
“good” art, then the best art in my 
view is that for which audience 
member is no longer even conscious 
of the performers. Performance 
arts, after all, are an inherently 
hierarchical 
endeavour; 
the 
performers presents something to 
the audience, while the audience 
observes 
and 
experiences 
the 
performance. The performers are 

the source of the entertainment, the 
audience the recipients of it.
The best art, then, is that which 
collapses this boundary. Just as my 
composition teacher argues that 
bridging the gap between what 
is possible and what should be 
possible is the greatest challenge 
of the creative process, bridging 
the 
boundary 
between 
those 
onstage and those in the audience 
is the biggest challenge of the 
performance practice.
Occasionally, 
I 
witness 
performances where this comes 
true, 
where 
I 
don’t 
perceive 
this natural hierarchy between 
performers 
and 
audience 
members to exist. These are 
performances where it doesn’t 
matter who is performing, or what 
they are performing. These are 
performances where all I perceive 
is the work itself. I have completely 
immersed myself in the suspension 
of disbelief.
I don’t mean to make it seem 
as though this is a common 
occurrence. Personally, I can think 
of perhaps five or ten performances 
where this is the case. There was a 
solo piano performance in Paris, 
a video opera in Carnegie Hall. 
There was a moment of traditional 
religious music in a rural village in 
Vietnam, a recording of the New 
York Philharmonic that I first 
listened to when I was 16.
These moments are few and far 
between. I never know when I will 
next experience them. And to this 
end, I sometimes fear that they 
are as much a result of my state 
of mind as they are the quality of 
the performance taking place. No 
matter how good the performers, 
if I am not ready to receive their 
performance, I will never truly 
appreciate it.
But this is perhaps the most 
magical aspect of the performing 
arts; their inexplicable ability to 
draw in a willing audience member 
for an hour or two and not let go. 
It is hard to explain and harder to 
replicate, an ever-elusive experience 
far out on the temporal horizon. 
And yet it is what motivates me to 
attend rehearsal after rehearsal, 
performance after performance. 
It is an incredibly powerful force, 
these performing arts; simple, brief, 
fragile, and yet moving beyond all 
else.

Art for what it is, not 
what it could be

The promise of an original 
premise 
isn’t 
enough 
to 
distinguish “An Anonymous Girl” 
from your common thriller.
Money forces us to consider 
things we wouldn’t normally do. It 
worms its way into our brains, 
saturating 
every 
thought 
with 
the 
anxious 
sense 
that: You need this. When 
desperate, conventions are 
put to the side. I remember 
clamoring to raise money 
for a student organization. 
The situation was classic: a 
fast-approaching 
deadline 
with less than half the funds 
raised. Suddenly, it seemed so 
easy to stand outside in biting 
cold and ask passersby for 
spare change, or to cast away 
reservations 
in 
soliciting 
distant family friends to donate. I 
signed up for psychological studies 
and began to perceive throwaway 
flyers scattered around campus in 
a different light — like decadent, 
bittersweet chocolate, promising 
to reward its subject 10 dollars 
for 30 minutes of their time for 
something as simple as filling out 
a questionnaire. Nothing, really. It 
was almost too good to be true.
Jessica, the protagonist of 
“An Anonymous Girl” by Greer 
Hendrick and Sarah Pekkanen, 
needs money. Jessica works as a 
makeup artist for BeautyBuzz, a 

fictional company that is a stickler 
to their rules and apparently 
doesn’t pay their workers enough. 
Hey, isn’t that the rub? She 
stomachs the insecure ramblings 
of sixteen-year-olds and high-
strung mothers, using pasted 
smiles and insincere assurances to 
reap better tips. Sure, she doesn’t 
love her job, but it pays the bills. 

In particular, it pays the medical 
bills for Becky, Jessica’s sister, 
whose treatment Jessica has 
been secretly paying for the last 
18 months. When one of Jessica’s 
clients, an entitled college student, 
complains about an eight a.m. 
appointment for a psych study 
— a questionnaire with a $500 
payment — Jessica shows up in her 
place instead.
The 
study, 
an 
innocuous 
questionnaire on morality, unfolds 
in an eerie manner. It starts with 
relatively tame questions like: 
Could you tell a lie without feeling 

guilt? That, in and of itself, doesn’t 
warrant an eyebrow raise. I 
imagine myself thinking sure, face 
deadpan. The “thriller” aspect 
slowly creeps up on you, offering 
readers only bits and crumbs with 
alternating perspectives of Jessica 
and 
the 
psychologist 
behind 
the study, Dr. Shields, gradually 
escalating to a prolonged, spine-
chilling end. By then, it’s hard 
to know who to trust. At one 
point, I even doubled down on 
the dog.
I 
admit, 
the 
premise 
itself is a tad gimmicky. 
$500 dollars for a two-hour 
questionnaire? 
I 
had 
to 
suspend my disbelief for over 
half of the novel and take it 
as it is: a thriller. I pushed 
logical questions aside — say, 
basic ethical principles? — so 
that my incredulity didn’t 
cloud up my experience. I 
wanted to shake Jessica and 
tell her: “Just go to the police!” 
In an attempt to emphasize 
its psychological premise, “An 
Anonymous 
Girl” 
is 
littered 
with well-known psychological 
studies like The Asch Conformity 
Study and The Invisible Gorilla 
experiment, references that allow 
readers to recall what they learned 
in their high school psychology 
class, but also cheapen the plot of 
“An Anonymous Girl” itself.

Postition review: running backs

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2018 regular season in 
the books, The Daily looks back 
at the performance of each unit 
this year and peers ahead to the 
future in 2019. In this edition: 
running backs

In the two weeks leading up 

to Michigan’s 41-15 Peach Bowl 
loss against Florida, with Karan 
Higdon having announced he 
would skip the game to focus 
on preparation for the NFL 
Draft, the program kept an air of 
calmness about the running back 
position. The thinking went: 
Freshman 
Christian 
Turner 

would get a chance to showcase 
his 
ability 
and 
placate 
any 

concerns for 2019.

On the Wolverines’ opening 

drive, as Turner took a jet sweep 
for a 41-yard score, that optimism 
seemed proven correct. Then, 
after a review, it turned out 
Turner stepped out of bounds 
right after the line of scrimmage. 
The touchdown was wiped out, 
and with it, any momentum 
Michigan’s running game had.

Turner finished that game 

with 32 yards rushing, nine 
fewer than he appeared to accrue 
on that first play. As a team, the 
Wolverines finished with 77 
yards on the ground, their worst 
mark since the season opener at 
Notre Dame — leaving a slew of 
questions to be answered.

HIGH POINT: 
All 
week, 

Michigan heard nothing but how 
Wisconsin would be a different 
kind of test — one that could 
determine whether five straight 
wins after that loss to the Irish 
was a mirage or the start of 
something real.

By that point, offensive line 

coach Ed Warinner’s grip had 
already taken hold on the run 
game, a move from the power-
heavy game that defined Jim 
Harbaugh’s first three years in 
charge to a zone-blocking game 
in full swing. The early results 

looked good, but the Badgers — 
a team that stifled Harbaugh’s 
run game in Madison the season 
prior — were on a different level.

Not only did the Wolverines 

blow the doors off Wisconsin in 
a 38-13 win that catapulted them 
to sixth in the rankings, but they 
did so behind a revitalized run 
game.

Not only did Higdon notch 

105 yards and a touchdown, 
but junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson came up with 90 and a 
touchdown of his own, including 
an 81-yard run to set up Higdon’s 
score.

The 
zone 
read 
had, 

emphatically, made its way to 
Ann Arbor.

“A lot of people have a lot of 

questions about who we are as 
a team, our offensive line, our 
run game, we don’t show up in 
big games,” Higdon said that 

night. “I think we laid that to rest 
today.”

Higdon went on to say that 

Michigan’s 
offensive 
line, 

heavily criticized after a poor 
performance at Notre Dame 
weeks earlier, was the best 
in the country. As much an 
overstatement as that was, it 
served to highlight a massive 
improvement that took place in a 
short span of time.

This is an article about the 

running back position, but it’s 
hard to run the ball without 
an offensive line and a sound 
philosophy. 
The 
Wolverines 

found both against Wisconsin.

“If 
a 
team 
is 
playing 

undisciplined, we’re going to use 
that to our advantage,” junior 
safety Josh Metellus said after 
the win over the Badgers. “The 
edges were squeezing in too 
hard on the inside zone, so Shea 

felt like he had a chance to pull 
it and he did. They kept being 
undisciplined, so Shea just kept 
taking advantage of that.”

LOW POINT: It would be 

easy to draw back to that night 
in South Bend here when the 
Wolverines ran for 58 yards, 
the offensive line looked like a 
season-killing disaster and there 
was no solution in sight.

But what happened next — a 

run game finding itself, then 
becoming a key cog in a 10-game 
win streak — makes it hard to 
describe the Notre Dame game 
as a low point as opposed to a 
launching pad.

The Peach Bowl, well, that’s 

another story.

Against the Gators, and more 

importantly, without Higdon, the 
Wolverines had no answer in the 
running game. That game served 
as a preview for what the position 

will look like in 2019, and it didn’t 
look pretty.

It turns out that Higdon, a 

leader who rushed for a combined 
2,172 yards in the last two seasons 
— 1,178 of which came in 2018 — 
will be pretty tough to replace.

“We’re going to be a dominant 

force (next season),” Turner said. 
“We’re going to be hard to stop. 
We’re going to be really good. All 
we can do is just improve off of 
what we have so far. I’m not going 
to downplay anybody’s skills 
or downplay anybody’s ability, 
because we have the skills to be 
great. Just need to tune it up and 
keep going.”

Despite an offensive line that 

returns four of five starters 
with the highly-touted Jalen 
Mayfield stepping in at tackle, 
it’s hard to project optimism 
after a performance like the one 
Michigan had in Atlanta.

The same, of course, could 

have been said on Sept. 2 — and 
the Wolverines proved anyone 
who did echo those sentiments 
wrong. Perhaps they’ll do so 
again, but a month after the 
Peach Bowl, it’s hard to say the 
low point has really ended.

THE FUTURE: With Higdon 

gone, the starting job next year is 
up for grabs.

After all the hype leading 

into the Peach Bowl and a 
performance 
that, 
albeit 

disappointing, 
was 
an 
inch 

away from exciting the fanbase, 
Turner will likely come into 
spring ball with a chance to take 
the job. Competition, however, 
will be tight.

Chris Evans will come in as a 

senior, and with some pedigree 
— making him the favorite. It’s 
easy to forget, but before Evans 
missed three games with injury 
this season, he got nearly as many 
carries as Higdon in a win over 
Western Michigan. Even with 
the injury — and over 50 fewer 
carries than he had in 2017 — 
Evans averaged a rock solid 5.2 
yards per carry.

Elsewhere, four-star recruit 

Zach 
Charbonnet 
figures 
to 

get a chance for playing time. 
A product of Oaks Christian 
Schoool and a top-50 overall 
recruit 
whose 
rating 
has 

bordered on five-star territory, 
Charbonnet ran for 4,741 yards in 
four years of high school and his 
tape is as good as the numbers 
suggest.

Tru Wilson, who earned 62 

carries as a walk-on last year, 
will figure into the rotation as 
well. Harbaugh complimented 
Wilson’s ability in pass protection 
multiple 
times 
last 
season, 

and the junior threw multiple 
pancake blocks throughout the 
season. If he keeps that up, it will 
be enough to continue earning 
playing time.

As for the position as a whole, 

the Wolverines come into 2019 
with 
more 
questions 
than 

answers.

just go back to his roots — 
during practice on Tuesday, 
Blankenburg 
skated 
with 

Michigan’s top line for the first 
time since converting back to 
being a forward.

“We’re changing things up a 

little bit there,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “It’s partially 
because 
we 
handicapped 

(redshirt sophomore forward) 
Luke Morgan a little bit by 
playing him at center. He’s a guy 
who likes to go up and down the 
ice as a wing and get to work.”

Blankenburg’s 
straight-

line speed is somewhat akin 
to Morgan’s, so it makes sense 
that he will be out on the wing 
as opposed to center. In this 
scenario, it seems likely that 
junior forward Jake Slaker will 
play center for the top line, given 
that he played that position 
as 
a 
freshman. 
Michigan’s 

offense has been productive 
enough since the turn of the 
calendar year despite the loss of 
sophomore forward Josh Norris 
for the remainder of the season, 
but it doesn’t hurt to maximize 
speed wherever possible.

Strauss Mann might get 

some more playing time again:

Michigan seemed to settle 

into starting junior goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne after four solid 
performances 
against 
Notre 

Dame, Ohio State and Penn 
State. However, Pearson opted 
to pull Lavigne for Mann against 
the Nittany Lions in New York 
when the former let in five goals 
in less than two periods.

Many of those were almost 

unguardable — the product 
of odd-man rushes following 
Michigan turnovers deep in 
the defensive zone. Regardless, 
leaving Lavigne in and further 
submarining his confidence in 
an already-decided game served 
no good purpose. Enter the 
New York-native Mann, who 
recorded 19 saves and didn’t let 
in a single goal against Penn 
State’s top-ranked offense.

“Whenever you can get into 

games after a while off it feels 
good,” Mann said. “To make 
some saves and play how I did, 
where I did, it’s a good feeling.”

Pearson knows that he has 

two different commodities in 
Lavigne and Mann — Mann 
tends to wander out of the goal 
a little more and take risks on 
shots, while Lavigne prefers to 
sit back in the net and operate 
from there out. And while 
Lavigne 
is 
somewhat 
more 

emotional as a player who rides 
his positive momentum, Mann 
maintains an even keel, whether 

Michigan is up by three goals or 
is getting pummeled, like it did 
at Madison Square Garden. For 
now, the question of who gets 
the start each night seems to be 
opened again, if just for a little 
bit. 

Breaking 
down 
where 

Michigan stands (and wants 
to stand) in the Big Ten:

Michigan sits in fourth place 

in the Big Ten with 21 points, 
but the team is in an unstable, 
if not perilous, spot. While the 
Wolverines are just four points 
behind 
second-place 
Notre 

Dame and can realistically catch 
it with a few wins, Michigan 
is also only one point ahead 
of Wisconsin, Penn State and 
Michigan State for last place in 
the conference.

Why is it especially significant 

that Michigan is in fourth? Seeds 
2-4 in the Big Ten tournament 
host the first round of the Big 
Ten Tournament. With getting 
an at-large bid probably out the 
window barring a miraculous 
winning streak, the Wolverines 
are going to need all the help 
they can get to get back to the 
NCAA 
Tournament 
for 
the 

second consecutive year.

Michigan’s 
next 
two 

opponents — the Spartans and 
the Nittany Lions — present 
good opportunities for the team 
to solidify its standing or even 
move up the ladder. After two 
inconsistent series against both 
teams in December, nothing is a 
given, but a sweep of Michigan 
State likely means one fewer 
team that the Wolverines have 
to worry about losing home-ice 
advantage to in the first round. 
Getting four or five points 
against Penn State would go a 
long way to ensuring home-ice 
for the first round, and maybe 
even the second round, too.

“I think everybody knows 

what’s going on and where we 
are, and we want to win a Big 
Ten championship,” Pearson 
said after Thursday’s 5-1 win 
over Penn State. “We do talk 
about that and it’s within our 
grasp.”

Notebook: Blankenburg to top 
line, Mann flashes at goaltender

On 
Thursday 
night, 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team will get its second shot at 
taking down No. 13 Iowa and 
star forward Megan Gustafson 
at Crisler Center after losing 
75-61 just two weeks ago. This 
time, though, the Wolverines 
may be without senior guard and 
captain Nicole Munger.

Munger 
exited 
Sunday’s 

contest against Michigan State 
in the first quarter with an 
apparent ankle injury and left 
the Wolverines with a gaping 
void to fill.

In addition to being one 

of the team’s vocal leaders, 
Munger holds experience and 
poise that many on the young 
Michigan team lack. And while 
Munger has been far and away 
the Wolverines’ best and most 
efficient deep threat and free 
throw shooter — she is shooting 
34.5 percent from three with 
41 makes and is shooting 94.3 
percent from the free throw 
line, both best on the team — it 
is the intangibles Munger brings 
that proves her true value to 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico.

“I mean Nicole (Munger) is not 

only one of our top scorers, but 
she is the glue to our program,” 
Barnes Arico said on Sports Talk 
1050 WTKA. “I mean we go as 
far as she goes. I’ve never seen 
a basketball player go as hard 
day-in and day-out as she does, 
and that’s in every aspect of the 
game. She plays with incredible 
passion on every possession and 
will do whatever our team needs 
to do to be successful.

“So she dives on the floor, she 

takes charges, she gets rebounds, 
she’s in on every single play and 
we need players that are willing 
to sacrifice and step in and do 
that.”

With 
Munger 
out, 
the 

Wolverines will need to look 
to 
players 
like 
sophomore 

guard Deja Church, sophomore 
forward 
Hailey 
Brown 
and 

junior guard Akienreh Johnson 
for outside shooting.

And need them they will if 

Michigan is going to have any 
chance of keeping up with the 
high-scoring Hawkeyes, who 
average just over 80 points per 
game, the 17th-highest mark in 
the nation.

The Wolverines will look to 

slow down the Iowa senior — 
who averages the most points 
per game in the country at 26.4 
— by playing a variety of players 
against her such as Brown, 
freshman forward Naz Hillmon 
and senior center Hallie Thome.

“(Gustafson’s) 
a 
dominant 

force, but we have kids that can 
match up against her,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think we did a 
good job for a half against her 
last game. Now we have an 
opportunity to play with our 
trio of post players that can go 
out and really match up with 
her. So she’s the key for them, 
but they have tremendous guard 
play as well and their guards do 
a tremendous job of playing off 
of Megan (Gustafson)”

Similar to Michigan, while 

the Hawkeyes have ridden 
Gustafson to a great season thus 
far and a dominant home record, 
one area they have struggled 
in is their road performance. 
Iowa is 4-3 on the road for the 
season and just 2-2 against Big 
Ten teams. The Wolverines, 
meanwhile, are 8-1 at home, 3-1 

against Big Ten teams and ready 
to welcome Iowa to Ann Arbor.

“We got an opportunity to 

get them at home, a place where 
we play well,” Barnes Arico 
said. “An opportunity for Hallie 
(Thome) and Megan Gustafson 
to have another matchup. You 
know they’ve been matched up 
for the last four years. It’s kind 
of been a great battle to watch 
those two go at each other. And 
hopefully we have Nicole back, 
but if not I always listen to coach 
Beilein and next man up and 
who’s going to be able to step up 
and give us an opportunity to be 
successful.”

Trash talking in basketball 

comes with a set of unwritten, 
but impossible-to-forget rules. 
Among the most important of 
these dictums: it doesn’t leave 
the court.

In 
the 
second 
half 
of 

Michigan’s 65-49 win over the 
Buckeyes on Tuesday, Zavier 
Simpson fell to the court after 
being on the business end of a 
hard screen from Ohio State’s 
Kaleb Wesson. As soon as the 
play was over, Simpson popped 
up, yelling and pointing at the 
Buckeye center.

Sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 

Poole and junior center Jon 
Teske came armed with words of 
their own. Wesson responded to 
both players, and he and Teske 
exchanged shoves, prompting 
officials to separate the two.

“We 
don’t 
share 
those,” 

Simpson said, when asked about 
the incident.

But therein lies the beauty 

of trash talk: to the extent that 
its impact can be quantified, 
you don’t have to know what, 
exactly, was said in order to do 
so.

The anatomy of that skirmish 

sums up a game that rode the 
emotional highs and lows of one 

of the fiercest rivalries in all of 
college sports. It sums up a team 
that prides itself on beating you 
down physically and mentally. 
And it sums up a team that 
wants to let you know that in the 
worst way.

“A game like this is huge 

emotionally, 
especially 
with 

it being a rivalry,” Poole said. 
“Obviously they’re a really good 
team. Being able to have the fire 
and the energy definitely sets 
a tone, being able to just take 
everything personally, that’s the 
type of game it was today.”

By now, if you know anything 

about 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team, you know that 

toughness starts with its junior 
point guard — who had no 
hesitation in calling himself the 
leader of it all.

“Everybody’s 

tough 
on 
the 

court 
until 

things really get 
deep,” 
Simpson 

said. 
“That’s 

when you know 
who’s 
really 

tough. 
… 
It’s 

about 
who’s 

going to take the 
charge, 
who’s 

going 
to 
grab 

that rebound, who’s going to 
dive on the floor, who’s going to 

make sure the team mindset is 
great. That’s really toughness.”

Simpson’s 
proven 
that 

toughness many 
times over. One 
thing he hadn’t 
done 
before 

Tuesday 
night, 

though, 
was 

record a triple-
double.

Simpson 

scored 
with 

his 
signature 

skyhook, 
and 

he even hit an 
uncharacteristic 

pullup 3-pointer among his 11 
points. His 12 assists came in 
just about every conceivable 
form: 
post 
feeds, 
kick-outs 

to open shooters, and fast 
break dimes. But the 6-foot-
tall Simpson also corralled 10 
rebounds, constantly scrapping 
against much larger men.

On the other end of the court, 

Simpson stayed busy guarding 
Ohio State’s C.J. Jackson and 
keeping him off the foul line, 
where he found success early. 
And it was his chasedown block 
of Wesson in transition that 
helped spark the fracas in the 
first place.

“You can’t say enough about 

Zavier Simpson and what he 
accomplished 
today,” 
said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“Triple-double is incredible, just 
to have the ball that much — he 
had 12 assists and no turnovers. 
He’s the sparkplug, and this 
game means a lot to him.

“He 
just 
competes. 
He’s 

relentless in his desire to win.”

Sometimes, the Wolverines’ 

toughness looks just like that — 
their floor general setting the 
tone, spearheading the defense 
and piloting the offense to 
perfection.

On other occasions, it looks 

like Poole — more known for 
his flashy playmaking than his 
defensive grit — receiving an 
elbow from the Buckeyes’ Andre 
Wesson and drawing a charge, 
and then draining a deep three 

on the next possession.

Sometimes, it even looks like 

the normally mild-mannered 
Teske, jawing with Wesson 
and 
earning, 
along 
with 

Wesson, a technical foul, which 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 

Livers speculated might have 
been the first of his lifetime.

In 
these 
instances, 
it’s 

Simpson’s fire, coursing through 
his teammates like a potion.

“He’s a leader,” Livers said. 

“Coach 
(Beilein) 
mentioned 

earlier, the head of the snake. 
He’s our leader, he’s our point 
guard, he does it all for us.”

As Poole lay on the ground 

after drawing his charge, he 
yelled, banging his fist against 
his chest. Rising off the floor, he 
continued shouting, raising his 
right arm to pump up a Crisler 
Center crowd and a student 
section already in the middle of 
its third or fourth loud rendition 
of 
an 
unprintable 
chant 

directed at Michigan’s southern 
neighbor.

This was the Wolverines, once 

again, showing off their mettle, 
and being more than happy to 
do so. And with Simpson setting 
the tone, and his team and 
fans following suit, Ohio State 
coach Chris Holtmann readily 
admitted his young squad had 
no answer.

“I think we can handle it 

better,” Holtmann said. “I think 
that was the cumulation of some 
frustration. For a variety of 
reasons I thought the game was 
really physical, for the bulk of 
the game, when it’s that physical 
those things kind of happen.

“We’ve got a lot of young 

bodies that are thrown out 
there, they’re trying to realize 
that for the first time, and I 
think we’re not there yet.”

Michigan, on the other hand?
“Everybody’s 
tough 
with 

their mouth but not tough with 
their play,” Simpson said. “Guys 
like to talk, which I appreciate, 
we feed off that, that gets us 
going. So when they do that, 
we’re just hungry for more.”

Michigan’s reliance on 3-point shooting on display in win over OSU

Facing an early 12-6 deficit 

Tuesday night against Ohio 
State, 
John 
Beilein 
pulled 

Jordan 
Poole 
aside 
during 

Michigan’s 
first 
timeout 
to 

give his sophomore guard a 
quick word of advice. “The only 
mistake you could make now,” 
Beilein told Poole, “would be to 
stop shooting.”

Poole, of course, needed no 

such instruction.

At his first chance out of the 

timeout, Poole caught a cross-
court pass from junior guard 
Zavier Simpson and — despite 
having missed his first two 
3-point attempts of the game 

and 21 of his past 26 — let go. 
Again, it clanked off the back of 
the rim. Seconds later, after an 
offensive rebound, Poole tried 
his luck once more. And again, it 
rimmed out. But 
the ball found 
its way back to 
Simpson 
and, 

armed with all 
the trust in the 
world, 
he 
hit 

Poole open on 
the wing.

This 
time, 

his shot found 
nothing but net.

“A 
lot 
of 

people would stop shooting 
after the first one then just 
kinda hesitate the second time,” 
Poole said. “But I’m a shooter. So 
being able to get looks like that 
is very rare.”

Added Beilein: “When he 

shoots and misses a few times, 
it’s not so bad. We know he’s 
gonna make them eventually.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
3-point 

shooting 
funk, 
though, 
had 

extended far beyond Poole. A 
35 percent team from deep on 
the season, they had shot under 
30 percent in four of the past 
six games, bottoming out in a 
3-for-22 performance against 

Minnesota last week.

For a team averaging 71.4 

points per game on the season, 
the difference was obvious. 
Before its Jan. 19 loss to 

Wisconsin, 
Michigan 
had 

not scored under 
60 points in two 
months, and had 
finished 
with 

under 
70 
just 

three times. And 
then — suddenly 
marred by a bout 
of 
unexpected 

3-point 
woes 

— 
they 
posted 

consecutive games in the 50s.

So with the threat of another 

offensive 
impasse 
looming, 

Beilein’s voice was not the only 
one filling Michigan’s huddle 
during 
that 
first 
timeout. 

Simpson — frustrated with the 
touch on his own shot — rallied 
his teammates.

“Yo, just stay locked in, stay 

ready,” 
Simpson 
said. 
“I’m 

gonna get y’all open, I’m gonna 
find y’all. We gonna make sure 
we get good shots.”

As usual, he made good on 

his promise. First, it was the 
repeated looks for Poole. Then, 
a swing pass to sophomore 

forward Isaiah Livers in the 
corner. Minutes later, he found 
redshirt junior forward Charles 
Matthews on a kick out, followed 
by an push pass to freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis in 
transition.

“Just being able to have a 

point guard who’s willing to 
get everybody else open and try 
to get us the best possible look 
even if his (shooting) isn’t going 
the right way,” Poole said. “Just 

being able to stay solid and find 
other ways to get assists.”

And just like that — on the 

back of four assists from their 
point guard and four ensuing 
daggers 
from 
deep 
— 
the 

Wolverines displayed their most 
impressive offensive basketball 
in weeks and turned a five-point 
deficit into a four-point lead that 
they would never relinquish.

The barrage continued into 

the second half, as the Buckeyes 

— who opened the game in a 
zone defense designed to force 
Michigan to shoot — could offer 
little resistance, allowing that 
four-point deficit to quickly 
balloon into a 20-point hole. 
As is so often the case, the 
Wolverines had their 3-point 
shooting to thank in a 65-49 
win.

“When you see us with 10 

made threes,” Beilein said, “it’s 
usually a W.”
