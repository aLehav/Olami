Social activist,
musician delivers
speech to celebrate
Dr. King's legacy
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
For the 28th annual Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Sympo-
sium, Hurry Belafonte, a social
activist and award-winning
musician, delivered the keynote
memorial lecture at Hill Audito-
rium.
Every year, the University
holds the largest Martin Luther
King, Jr. Day symposium of any
college in the nation. Along with
the keynote speech, the Univer-
sity held several other events that
examined the symposium's 2014
theme, "Power, Justice, Love:
Heal the Divide."
According to the symposium's
website, the notions of power,
justice and love were trans-
formed during the Civil Rights

Movement in the 1950s and
1960s. Together, these changed
concepts helped bridge the
divide created by racial violence
and inequality.
Belafonte, a noted singer and
songwriter, worked with King
and former President John F.
Kennedy during the Civil Rights
Movement. He was formerly a
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador,
promoting one of the United
Nations principal charitable
organizations.
Belafonte called onthe attend-
ees to look for solutions to a
variety of systemic problems,
ranging from lingering racism to
violence agasint women, adding
that, "somewhere along the line
we (the nation) seemed to have
lost our moral compass."
During his speech, Belafonte
discussed issues the country cur-
rently faces, such as the unequal
distribution of wealth and its
connection to the prevalence of
racism and sexism in popular
culture.
Belafonte also recounted the

BSU demands seven
initiatives aimed to
improve diversity
By YARDAIN AMRON &
CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporters
The protest lasted barely ten
minutes, but the ultimatum was
clear: seven demands, seven
days.
Coinciding with Martin

Luther King, Jr. Dayon Monday,
students from the Black Student
Union protested the Universi-
ty's response to racial issues on
campus across Central Campus.
As the first wave of students
and staff filed out from social
activist Henry Belafonte's key-
note address at Hill Auditorium,
a line of about 15 students from
BSU were waiting on the steps,
signs in hand.
Engineering junior Rob-
ert Greenfield, BSU treasurer,
stepped onto a lamppost plat-

form and addressed a crowd of
about 30 people.
"What brings me here today
is not that social action is done.
What brings me here today is
the unfinished business of the
first three fights of the Black
action movement," Greenfield
said.
LSA senior Erick Gavin, a
member of the BSU, took Green-
field's place on the lamppost
and laid out a concrete list of
demands, some of which were
addressed late last week by the

University.
Business senior Shayla Scales,
who spoke last, demanded a
response from the University's
administration.
"We have heard the Universi-
ty use the phrase 'We are listen-
ing' since 1970, and I am tired of
waiting for a response. We are
tired of waiting for a response,"
Scales said. "We allow the
University seven days to end
negotiations and to come to con-
clusions on our seven demands."

A video game can take up to
100 professional developers and
over a year to create, but this past
weekend, 70 University students
created them in teams of four in
only 48 hours.
Wolverine Software, a student

At the end of the 48th hour,
students played each other's

Let the caffination begin. Or

Starbucks opened its Michi-

Starbucks occupies the

Prof. curated notable hall of fame

Bruce Conforth is a lecturer
in the Department of American
Culture and received his doctor-
ate in 1990 from Indiana Univer-
sity. Conforth was the founding
curator of the Rock 'N' Roll Hall
of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, and
is a director of the Blues Heritage
Foundation. He won the Golden
Apple Award as the Most Out-
standing Professor of2012.
Areyou happy about how the
Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame
has grown and changed
under later curators?
I have (gone back). It was an
exciting and interesting job at the
time. But I've moved on to a lot

of other things in my life, so that
particular element does not hold
a lot of interest for me anymore.
I'm much more interested in liv-
ing today than I am in living in
the past.
Could you speak of your recent
studies ofRobertJohnson?
I have a book that's going tobe
coming out: "The Definitive Biog-
raphy of Robert Johnson." And
I've more or less been interested
in Robert Johnson for the last 50
years. I think he's probably the
first modern blues artist. And it's
interesting how much mythology
American culture has surround-
ed him with.

Artistically, how doesbeing
a youth in 1960s New York
compare to living in
Ann Arbor now?
We're talking about a 50-year
difference. The times have
changed. As a result, obviously,
I've changed. Ann Arbor is a
remarkably exciting and vibrant
place and I love it here. And I don't
think it would be fair to compare
New York City in the '60s with
Ann Arbor in 2010. Each place
has its own unique characteris-
tic and history and culture. It's
kind of like comparing apples and
oranges.

Fashion show promotes arts
and innovation on campus

EnspiRED event
makes its eighth
apperance on campus
By BRIE WINNEGA
Daily Staff Reporter
Student models donning under-
grad-produced designs stomped
down the runway Saturday night.
EnspiRED, a student organiza-
tion that aims to promote artis-

tic expression at the University,
hosted the fashion show. Taking
place in the Biomedical Science
Research Building, it also featured
pieces from artists nationwide.
The event is traditional-
ly EnspiRED's biggest of the
year, LSA senior Tyrell Collier,
EnspiRED production manager
and president, said.
"We wanted to show that you
can be innovative, you can be cre-
ative, and you can do things that
are outside of the norm," Col-

Her said. "I feel like when people
leave this show this will be some-
thing they've never seen before
on campus."
In its eighth year on campus,
EnspiRED donated 15 percent of
the show's proceeds to Art Road
Nonprofit, an organization dedi-
cated to funding art classes in
southeast Michigan schools that
have lost support for their pro-
grams. EnspiRED is also plan-
ning a trip to Detroit to assist the
nonprofit through volunteer work.
The majority of the generated
money will fund this year's and
next year's show.
The show featured five waves
of clothing designs: Liberation,
Creation, Innovation, Domination
and Live Red Nation.
"To 'live red' means to be
happy, be creative and just be you
and do what makes you happy,"
LSA senior Danetta Jameson, an
EnspiRED model, said.
Collier said he hopes to demon-
strate the positive influence Afri-
can American students have on
campus through organizations like
EnspiRED and its fashion show.
"We are a majority Black orga-
nization, meaning that aur execu
tive board is a majrity African
Americans," Collicr said. "'this is
being Black at Michigan to me."
For the first time, Music, The-
atre and Dance sophomore Stephon
Dorsey had the opportunitytoshow-
case his own clothing designs from
his line called Vision by Goodsteph.
"I wanted to showcase some-
thing that exemplified the whole
idea of using what you have to get
what you want," said Dorsey. "At
first, it was definitely a little hec-
tic, and I was a little anxious and
worried, but once I was able to see
everybody on the screen - that
was the most glorifying moment
of my life."
LSA junior Taylor Clayborne said
she enjoyed the outfits, models and
venue that the show had to offer.
"I think that it's awesome that
they're using local and student
clothing lines," Clayborne said.
"I'm really impressed that this
was all student-run."

Legislators push to

West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray
Tomblin and U.S. Sen. Joe Man-
chin on Monday proposed tighter
regulations for chemical storage
facilities after a spill contaminat-
ed the water supply for 300,000
people.
Tomblin, the Democratic gov-
ernor, urged passage of a chemical
storage regulatory program. The
bill aims to address shortcomings
that allowed 7,500 gallons of coal-
cleaning chemicals to seep into
the Elk River on Jan. 9. Freedom
Industries, whichowned the plant
that leaked the chemicals, filed for
Chapter 11bankruptcy Friday.
Freedom Industries' safety
flaws, including a last-resort con-
tainment wall filled with cracks,
went largely undetected, because
as a facility that neither manu-
factured chemicals, produced
emissions, or stored chemicals
underground, it was not subject to
environmental regulations, state
Department of Environmental
Protection officials have said. The
chemical that spilled also wasn't
deemed hazardous enough for
additional regulation.

U. S., Europe to lift

in nuclear deal
Iran unplugged banks of cen-

on Monday, prompting the Unit-

partially lift economic sanctions
as a landmark deal aimed at eas-
ing concerns over Iran's nuclear
program went into effect.
The mutual actions - curb-
ing atomic work in exchange for
some sanctions relief - start a
six-month clock for Tehran and
the world powers to negotiate
a final accord that the Obama
administration and its Europe-
an allies say will be intended to
ensure Iran cannot build a nucle-
ar weapon.
In the meantime, the interim
deal puts limits on Iran's program
- though it continues low levels
of uranium enrichment. Tehran
denies its nuclear program is
intended to produce a bomb.

Musicians range
from students to
professionals
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
For the Daily
On a blustery Sunday after-
noon, more than300 students and
faculty attended the free, semi-
annual Life Sciences Orchestra
concert in Hill Auditorium.
LSO is one of the organizations
included in the University's Gifts
of Art program, which brings a
host of art and music programs
to the University of Michigan
Health System, according to
Elaine Sims, the director of the
University's Gifts of Art.
Representing the science and
medical communities at the Uni-
versity, the 71 members of the
group range from undergraduate
students to professors and doc-
tors in the medical field.
The orchestra serves as an out-
let for the high-stress jobs and
intense studies of its members,
said LSO co-founder Kara Gavin,
who is also lead public relations
representative for the University
Health System. She also plays the
French horn and is a member of
the Executive Committee of the
LSO.
David Brown, associate pro-
fessor of otolaryngology and a
founding member of the LSO,
echoed Gavin's sentiments.
"It is a creative outlet for the
people playing in it, but it's also
an opportunity for others to hear
a performance by their friends,
family members and their col-
leagues, and to showcase their
talents," Brown said.
With a theme based on water,
the concert included perfor-
mances of Felix Mendelssohn's
"Calm Sea and Prosperous Voy-
age" Op. 27, Johannes Brahms'
Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op.
73 and Claude Debussy's "La
Mer," all performed under Music
Director Adrian Slywotzky.
"I looked at the recent of his-
tory of the LSO and tried to
explore more composers that the
orchestra hadn't played in the
past few years so that the players
could have a little bit of variety,"
Slywotzky said. "Since we have
a long season ... it's important
to find music that will keep us
engaged for that many hours."
In a lecture before the concert,
Slywotzky presented historical
information about the music and
composers that were featured in
the concert. He also prompted
the audience to listen for various
aspects of the compositions.
Gifts of Art is notfundedbythe
University, and therefore relies

on donations from its members
and friends and family.
For the first time in the con-
cert's 14-year history, an indi-
vidual donation underwrote
the performance. The donation
came from Lester Monts, senior
vice provost for academic affairs
and professor of musicology.
Monts announced earlier this
year that he will step down from
his administrative position after
holding it for 20 years. He will
shift his focus to his faculty posi-
tion and research starting in July.
"For me, I'm always a little
nervous until the second piece
but I thought it (the concert) was
lovely," Sims said. "Every year it
gets better."
In preparation for the concert,
the LSO practiced almost every
Sunday beginning in September.
The group will continue practic-
ing for their next free and public
concert on April 27.
Brown said LSO formed when
he decided to expand his "doc-
tor's quintet" into something
larger so that others could also
contribute.
"I met with Elaine Sims and
Kara Gavin and a few others in
August of 2000," he said. "We
scurried and had auditions (for
the LSO) that September and
that's when the orchestra start-
ed."
In the beginning, the orches-
tra was going to be for leisurely
activity, to get together and play
music, according to Surgery Prof.
Robert Bartlett, a founding mem-
ber of the group.
"After the first couple of weeks
we said, 'Alright, we have to play
at some point,"' he said.
All LSO members and aspiring
members have to audition yearly
for a chance to perform with the
group. The process involves play-
ing an intricate piece of music for
the music director and one mem-
ber of the executive committee.
"There is that strange connec-
tion between medicine, music
and science, and so there are just
so many people who are ... just
thrilled to be able to have music
back in their lives because of the
LSO," Sims said.
LSA sophomore D'Arcy Cook
said she has been playing with
the LSO since she auditioned her
freshman year.
"When I was in high school
my French horn teacher helped
me explore possible ways to
keep playing French horn even
though I didn't want to be a
music major," Cook said. "There
was campus orchestra and
everything but one of the orches-
tras that's good for the science
people is LSO, so that was one
of the three or so orchestras that
was an option for me."

Islamic milants threaten
Sochi Winter Olympic games

Russia has deployed
100,000 police,
soldiers and other
forces for security
MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's
counter-terrorism agency says
it's studying a video posted by
an Islamic militant group that
asserted responsibility for
suicide bombings that killed
34 people last month and is
threatening to strike the Win-
ter Olympics in Sochi.
Security experts say the
Russians are right in taking
the threat seriously.
The video was posted online
Sunday by a militant group in
Dagestan, a predominantly
Muslim republic in Russia's
volatile North Caucasus. The
Olympic host city of Sochi
lies only 500 kilometers (300
miles) west of Dagestan.
Two Russian-speaking men
featured in the video are iden-
tified as members of Ansar al-
Sunna, the name of a Jihadist
group operating in Iraq. It was
unclear whether the men in
the video had received fund-
ingor training from that group
or only adopted its name.
There was no confirmation
the two men were the sui-
cide bombers who struck the
southern Russian city of Vol-
gograd last month as the video
claims. Scores of people were
also injured by the bombings
of a train station and a bus.
Russia's National Anti-Ter-
rorism Committee said Mon-
day it was studying the video
and would have no immediate
comment. The video couldn't
be viewed in Russia, where
Internet providers cut access
to it under a law that bans the
"dissemination of extremist
materials."
In Washington, a Penta-
gon spokesman Monday said
the U.S. has offered support
to the Russian government as
it conducts security prepara-

tions for the Winter Olympics.
Rear Adm. John Kirby said the
U.S. will offer air and naval
support, including two Navy
ships in the Black Sea, to be
available if requested "for all
manner of contingencies," in
consultation with the Russian
government.
The video was released by
the Vilayat Dagestan, one of
the units that make up the so-
called Caucasus Emirate, an
umbrella group for the rebels
seeking to establish an inde-
pendent Islamic state in the
North Caucasus.
Doku Umarov, a Chechen
warlord wholeadsthe Emirate,
had ordered a halt to attacks
on civilian targets in 2012. But
he rescinded that order in July,
urging his followers to strike
the Sochi Olympics, which he
denounced as "satanic dances
on the bones of our ancestors."
The games run from Feb. 7-23.
The Kremlin-backed leader
of Chechnya claimed last week
that Umarov was dead, but the
claim couldn't be verified. The
Vilayat Dagestan statement
said the Volgograd attacks
were carried out in part
because of Umarov's order, but
it didn't specifically say he had
ordered them.
Dagestan has become the
center of an Islamic insur-
gency that has engulfed Rus-
sia's North Caucasus after two
separatist wars in Chechnya.
Militants seeking to create an
independent state governed
by Islamic Shariah law in the
Caucasus launch daily attacks
on police and other authorities
there. One of the two ethnic
Chechen brothers accused of
staging the Boston Marathon
bombings spent six months in
Dagestan in 2012.
Andrei Soldatov, an inde-
pendent Moscow-based secu-
rity analyst, said the video
threat need to be taken seri-
ously.
"They have capabilities to
strike beyond the North Cau-
casus, which they demonstrat-

ed in Volgograd," he said. "It's
extremely difficult to stop a
'lone wolf' suicide bombing
attack."
Georgy Mirsky, a respected
Russian expert on the Middle
East, said the video reflected
the increasingly close ties
between Jihadists in the Cau-
casus and elsewhere. Russia's
war against Caucasus mili-
tants has made it an enemy
on par with the United States
and Israel for militant Islamic
groups in the Middle East, he
wrote on his blog.
Russia has responded to the
Islamic threat by introducing
some of the most sweeping
security measures ever seen at
an international sports event.
Some 100,000 police, army
and other security forces have
been deployed, according to
analysts, and tight restrictions
have been placed on access to
the Sochi area.
Anyone attending the Win-
ter Olympics has to buy a tick-
et online from the organizers
and obtain a spectator pass
that requires providing pass-
port details.
Authorities have already
barred access to all cars reg-
istered outside of Sochi and
Russian police have gone
house-to-house methodically
screening all city residents.
Soldatov argued, however,
that Russia's massive secu-
rity presence at the Olympics
could also have an adverse
effect.
"When you put so many
troops on the ground, you
might get some problems with
the coordination of all these
people," he said.
Soldatov noted that the omi-
nous threat of a "present" for
the visitors to the Games con-
tained in the video is loosely
phrased and could herald an
attack outside tightly guarded
Olympic facilities.
"They never tried to specify
the place where they might
strike, that's why everybody

Emergency re - evaluation
The 'U' needs to have a definitive policy in place for emergencies
The University reopened for the winter term on Jan. 8 and
remained open that week in the middle of extremely frigid
temperatures brought on by the "Polar Vortex" storm. Though
there is an emergency closure policy in place in the University's Standard
Practice Guide, the current policy isn't specific enough and doesn't include
a comprehensive action plan. According to Provost Martha Pollack, the
University didn't have the "appropriate mechanisms" to close campus
during the week of the storm. The existing policy needs to be reevaluated
in order to ensure the University is prepared for emergencies with the
safety of students and employees in mind.

Let's talk about race

The current University Standard Practice
Guide is vague regarding closure protocol.
According to the policy, in circumstances
which include severe weather, "some or all
services may be discontinued or reduced."
Likewise, a closure "may include the cessation
of non-essential services." However, the
University hasn't definitively distinguished
between essential and non-essential staff.
The well-being of students should seriously
be evaluated when reconsidering the policy.
According to the Ann Arbor Public Schools'
unsafe weather guidelines, K-12 schools are
mandated to close when the "temperature
and/or wind chill are below -200F." Similarly,
a wind chill advisory by the National Weather
Service goes in effect when wind chills are 15
degrees below zero or lower.
Other Michigan institutions have already
implemented extreme weather policies which
address issues that the University's existing
policy does not. Both Eastern Michigan
University and Michigan State University have
policies that provide various communication
channels to alert both employees and students
about campus closings. Michigan State's policy
even specifies that all departments are forced
to have emergency plans in place that include
identifying essential employees.

Closure and evacuation policies are espe-
cially important for the University around
term breaks since a majority of the current
student body are long distance travelers -
about 57 percent of students are out-of-state
residents and 9 percent are international
students. Since the reopening of the Uni-
versity coincided with severe weather this
year, many students had difficulty returning
to Ann Arbor. The many unexpected travel
delays also created issues with the academic
policy. The first classes of the semester are
often used to measure student attendance
and track waitlisted students. In an e-mail
sent to all students on Jan. 7, Dean of Stu-
dents Laura Blake Jones wrote that students
shouldn't be dropped if they were unable to
attend their first class meetings. However,
according to student accounts, some smaller
classes such as discussion sections and Eng-
lish classes were hesitant to follow the sug-
gested rule modifications. The modified
class drop policy should be made universal
throughout the University and be strictly
enforced in all departments. By includingspe-
cific definitions of severe weather and closure
policies, the University would ensure the
safety of students and employees alike during
emergency situations.

SAMUEL MYERS
Deprived of diversity

MiC check 1, 2. 1, 2. Can you hear
us? Because we're here.
we are Michigan in Color, the
Daily's first opinion section desig-
nated as a space for and by students
of color at the University of Michi-
gan. welcome! MiC is a place for
people of color tovoice their opinions
and share experiences that are over-
shadowed by dominant narratives
- orthe history, stories and perspec-
tives that privilege conformity and
make it into the mainstream, mar-
ginalizing all other narratives in the
process. we hope MiC will elevate
conversations on race, identity, liber-
ation and social justice while engag-
ing specifically with communities of
color on campus.
Race is a topic that can elicit
several different emotions; from
shame, pride, anger, confusion,
love, discomfort, or all of the above
- this space is here to explore it
all. We want to unearth "taboos."
We want the topics that feel a
bit too coarse to talk about in a
crowded coffee shop to roll right
off your tongue in this safe space.
We want to challenge the historical
whiteness of The Michigan Daily
by creating this long-needed space
that will hopefully lead to a more
inclusive newsroom and a better
informed campus.
To kick off this exciting new
project, we will start at the roots of
MiC: What exactly does "person of
color" mean?
Person/people of color - or PoC
- is a blanket term typically used to
refer to all non-white individuals.
The termis far fromperfect. Justlook
at the definition: It doesn't say what
we are, but rather points to what we
are not. As with any umbrella term,
using the label PoC runs the risk of
collapsing many diverse and complex
identities and experiences into one
j
am most at home when Ilam
traveling between places.
In the eighteen years it took
me to come to
this realization,
I spent hun-
dreds of hours
on airplanes,
coming and
going between
the cities and
countries I grew JULIA
up in. As "third
culture kids," ZARINA
my friends and I
moved as easily
between time zones and continents
as we did between languages, cur-
rencies and cultures.
Growing up, we collected infor-
mation the way some people collect
postage stamps. We could both curse
and say "I love you" with conviction
in a dozen languages and eat our
mealsojust as comfortably on the floor
with our hands as with chopsticks at
a table. Like staring at a square-inch
sepia print of some distant monarch
and wondering about the place the
letter came from, I liked having just
enoughinformation aboutsomething
to be intrigued by the larger concept
it represented. My motivation to
be better was always the pursuit of
somethingjust out of reach - if I had
all of something, there was nothing
left of it to want - and so I drifted
happily from place to place and from
person to person. I was content with

the balance my friends and I existed
in. We belonged nowhere and every-
where at the same time.
For many of us, going "home" was
the hardest part. It meant trying to
make sense of a culture you were
inherently supposed to understand
and love, even when that culture
sometimes made little effort to return
the sentiment. I had endless ques-
tions, some big, some small. What
was that song on the radio? Would
wearing my favorite salwar kameez
be unwelcome appropriation of a cul-
ture no stranger would immediately
associate me with? Being"American"
seemed to require full commitment

falsely homogenous and broad group.
Many different identities exist under
the PoC umbrella, and we will never
suggest that all PoCs have the same
experiences, beliefs or priorities,
just like we will never deny that
differences and hierarchies exist
within the phrase itself. How can any
phrase encompass the experiences of
agroup of people so diverse?
It can't, so in introducing this
space, we must first recognize the
limitations of the phrase "people
of color." Instead of relying on this
very general and oversimplified
phrase to identify us, we appreciate
the power of personal narrative
in making our individual voices
and specific experiences heard,
debunking myths and unpacking
stereotypes in the process.
"Unfortunately, so many times,
people of color hear the term 'people
of color' from other white people that
(PoCs) think white people created
it instead of understanding that we
self-named ourselves," Loretta oss,
a reproductive rights activist said in
a talk about feminism. "This is term
that has a lot of power for us."
The dominant narrative often
excludes and silences the diverse
experiences of PoCs, both on and
off campus. Through MiC, we hope
to open one avenue through which
PoCs on campus can make their voic-
es heard. All posts published on MiC
are written and edited by PoCs, mak-
ing this a space that is truly ours. On
a campus that is 72.6 percent white,
having a space just for students of
color isn't just important; it's essen-
tial for our survival and thrival on
campus; this space is radical.
MiC isn't a diversity project,
because diversity is just about num-
bers, and our vision is much bigger
than any set of statistics. First and
foremost, we hope MiC will create
Flying hom
to an identity that was clearly laid out
in movies, in speech, in beliefs. Oth-
erwise, your American-ness came
with some qualifiers.
Sometimes I catch myself making
up easier truths. I tell people I grew
up in Texas, which, in the Midwest,
is just unusual enough to invite nei-
ther suspicion nor familiarity. Adapt-
ing to anew identity comes naturally,
something everyone who comes to
school here has done to some extent.
For me and many others, it can be
tempting to lose the more compli-
cated pieces of our identity in favor
of such a well-accepted new one. We
can't proudly make our own hands
into maps of Michigan - maps of our
home - when we are questioned and
say "Here. This is where I'm from.
This is me." The walls in my room are
filled with dozens of pictures - cam-
els at the market, my sister and I in
matching galabeyas, old friends, old
lovers - not because I want to relive
the past, but because I don't want to
forget it. My home isn't as much a
place as it is moments in time that are
impossible to return to.
Airports are the first home of
any third culture kid and are per-
fect environments for the kind of
self-reflection that is difficult to do
in a place like a university, where
you are supposed to be unwaver-
ingly true to an identity. I find myself
focused on tiny details about people
in a place where fleeting impressions
are the only impressions. There are

people who roll their sleek suitcases
through terminals with a stride that
carefully implies they are very busy
and their suits are very expensive. I
wonder if they think of themselves
the way that the woman working the
end of the night shift who sold them
coffee thinks of them. Is the way I
walk desperate to convey that every
adjective I embody was hard-won?
When people look at me, does a single
phrase jump to mind?
I've always loved airports
because they were our whole lives
condensed, sped up and laid out
before us for examination like film
on an editor's table. A rush of lan-

a space where we, as people of color,
are free to unapologetically express
and be ourselves as we discuss our
ideas, goals, dreams and experienc-
es while fostering this collaborative
and creative space. Not everything
in this space will tackle heavy
issues (we are people, after all), but
we expect that many of our posts
will be powerful and provocative,
discussing marginalized and trivi-
alized topics like anti-Blackness,
internalized racism and University
policies on "diversity and inclu-
sion" that so desperately need to
be part of the larger conversation
on campus.
We also want this to be a safe
space for both our writers and read-
ers, and personal attacks will not
be tolerated. This is a platform for
speaking out about the lived experi-
ences of students on campus, both
good and bad, in whatever cre-
ative form writers see fit. We aren't
hostile assailants but pursuers of
whispered memories as a source of
change instead of shame.
As the founding editors of
Michigan in Color, this project means
a lot to us. We're excited; we're ready.

guages, destinations, stories never
heard in full, and small corners of
the world you come to know impos-
sibly well for an hour or two. Every
person passing by is unknown: in
your life for a brief, shared experi-
ence and then gone again.
On the plane, the comfortable
myopia fades away. As we gather
speed and the dots of city lights
blur into lines through the window,
there's an ambiguous sense of loss
and a familiar melancholy - a nostal-
gia for a time that hasn't passed yet.
I am never conscious of where I am
goingor where I am leaving but I am
infinitely aware of hurtling towards
some great and obscure unknown,
as though if the engines were to sud-
denly cut out the plane could just as
easily fall to earth as it could void the
laws of gravity and fall up in to the
sky, an accidental spaceship destined
for some nameless galaxy. I once
heard someone say that they imag-
ined dying tobe a little like that and
I think it mustbe true. It's a little like
being born, I guess, too. Or a little
like falling in love. Or any number of
our most important occurrences.
When you overthink your sense
of time, the other five fade out. With
this comes the inevitable epiphany
that I will never have a moment of
certainty that isn't already in the
past. From the ground it seems fatal-
istic and terrifying, but in the air it's
an entirely different matter. Without
deciding, I have an innate resolve to

do allthe things a person with no fear
of the unknown should do. I will run
to the person I love and tell them; I
will admit to any insecurity. Instead
of the usual prayers to my gods - the
gods of shootingstars and shiny pen-
nies - to help direct the outcome of
things I personally cannot, I think of
all the times I've been there before.
Every culture, every country, every
new friend, new class and new plan I
couldn't predict the ending to.
In the uncertainty I am resolutely,
perfectly athome.

Last November's BBUM hashtag that took
over social media for a few days temporar-
ily made room for a dialogue about the lack of
diversity at the University of Michigan. Occur-
ring simultaneously with similar movements
at other large universities, much attention
became focused on the general and widespread
lack of diversity in higher education. It seemed
that, for a moment, we, as a university but also
as a nation, were poised to call into question
our education and what it was doing to foster a
more racially aware and equitable world.
Unfortunately, as most internet-fueled
movements do, the BBUM hashtag lost its
luster. The discussion about the severe lack
of diversity at the University fell back into the
depths of academia and modern civil rights
discourse, both of which are regrettably not
sexy enough for "news" - CNN, MSNBC, let
alone FOX News. Though I felt very personally
connected to the movement, my own vigor
faded too - admittedly, it was finals time, and
so my anxieties and attention were elsewhere.
This is a new semester, though, and I do
not yet have a paper assigned. I have also been
presented with an opportunity to reconsider
and criticize what my university is doing to
fight institutional, subtle and the many other
iterations of racism. I am in my third class
within the Department of Afroamerican
and African Studies. In DAAS, I have found
the most talented, critical and personable
professors of any that I've encountered at the
University. I have also found that discussions
are livelier than in any other department and
that students feel very legitimately connected
to the material. Some things that I have
not found: people majoring in business or
economics, people majoring in engineering,
people majoring in math or people majoring
in science.
I cannot speak to the actual frequency with
which business or engineering students take
DAAS classes - or any other courses that deal
very intimately with the United States' blatant

and undeniable history of racial inequality. I
can, though, speak from my own experience
and also from these departments' degree
requirements. Undergraduate engineering
students need only complete three credits in
humanities. In LSA, to get a Bachelor of Arts
or Science degree, students must take but
one "Race & Ethnicity" course. And speaking
from experience with many students, these
small opportunities - to enhance one's
understanding of how race inflects politics,
economics and social life - are often spent in
search of easy A's to counteract the wanton
grading in science and math departments.
If we aren't taught in college - though
earlier would be better-- that racism is not gone
or, for that matter, that unfettered capitalism
is producing more and more discrepancy and
stratification in wealth, then these injustices
are doomed to continue.
In light of the #BBUM movement and my
own experiences, I am prepared to ask, what
is the University really doing to fight racism,
poverty and inequality? What is any university
or business school doing? If these things are
not central to every college student's education,
then what are the real prospects of achieving
a better world? Or perhaps I'm mistaken in
assuming that is the goal.
I know, too, that the opposite argumentcould
be brought against me. After all, I can admit
that I have never taken a college-level math
or accounting course, and most LSA students
probably do not. Granted, our abilities to cal-
culate an integral or balance checkbooks may
very well suffer. But thousands of future doc-
tors, executives, economists and programmers
- indeed high-paid and powerful people -
graduate every year without knowing anything
about the War on Drugs and that hundreds of
thousands of minorities are in prison for petty
drug offenses, their families and communities
devastated as a result. Who suffers then?

GAMES
From Page 1A
First place winners were given
a trophy, medals and first picks
from a table holding prizes rang-
ing from video games to t-shirts
and pens. Mini-achievement
awards were also given out so
all participants received a prize.
Some of the prizes included a
gold-painted rock for the team
that had the most solid game idea
and a gold-painted Monster drink
for the person who stayed up the
longest.
The event has grown since its
inception in 2004. This year's
competition included nine more
students than last year's event
and 41 more students than two
years ago.
In addition to creating a com-
plex game in a brief period of
time, students incorporated a
theme reveled at the beginning
of the event. This year the theme
was "separate."
Engineering freshman Alex
Dishaw and his team incorpo-
rated the theme by giving their
game's character the ability to
separate his torso from the rest of
his body.
"This is my first time I've made
a video game and it's really, really
fun," LSA junior Hope Tambala

said. "Hearing my music and
playing the game that I helped
design is really cool."
Engineering junior Austin
Yarger, WSOFT president, said
the ideal team is comprised of
two programmers, an artist and a
musician. However, not all teams
had experience in some of the
roles and many participants were
forced to test their abilities in new
roles.
"That is kind of part of the fun
of game development," Yarger
said. "You often are exposed to
so many different industries and
art forms that may be out of your
comfort zone. You learn a lot. It's
wonderful."
While participants are allowed
to leave at any time during the
competition, some competitors
made themselves comfortable in"
various corners of the Duderstadt
Center and stayed overnight.
Engineering junior Robert
Reneker came to the event pre-
pared to sleep in the library both
nights. While his teammateswent
home, he laid out a few blankets
and slept on the floor.
"Ilikedtheideaofsleepinghere
and staying the night," Reneker
said. "I could just get right up and
go straight to work once I got up
in the morning."

ity into the Union. The two estab-
lishments will share a seating
area.
"I think they will both be great
places to hang out, study, meet
friends and gather with student
organizations," she said.
Business junior Michael
Proppe, Central Student Govern-
ment president, agreed, adding
that he hoped the two could gen-
erate more activity in the Union.
"There are so many student
organizations housed here,"
Proppe said. "I don't think a lot of
students know the Union outside
of the food court in the basement.
But these are going to be very
popular with a lot of students,
bringing them through so they
cansee theotherstuffthat'sgoing
on here as well."
Starbucks will be open from 7
a.m. to 1:30 a.m. Monday through
Saturday and 9 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. on
Sundays and is expected to appeal
to late night studiers.
Renovations to the space pre-
served historic details of the
95-year-old building while mak-
ing some changes to conform to
the traditional Starbucks atmo-

sphere.
Store manager Nikki Beaudry,
who has nine years experience
working for the company, said she=
is excited because of the unique
location and customer base of a'
college campus.
"I think it's a great place to be,""
she said. "I love the young atmo-
sphere and I'm excited we can be
a place for students to come study
and drink coffee, not only stu-
dents but administrative people
and people in the community as
well. We're unique because we're
the first Starbucks ever to be in
the Michigan Union, and we're a
little different looking than other
Starbucks because we still have,
that historical feel with a little
bit of the pop of the modern Star-
bucks."
As a part of its opening festivi-
ties, Starbucks will hand out free,
tall coffees from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
Wednesday, and samples of sand-
wiches, espresso and blended
beverages from 11a.m. to 1 p.m.
Pile said she has high hopes for
the coffee chain's newest location.'
"I think food is a really key
component in bringing people
together," Pile said. "Coffee in
particular helps drive community
building which is really what the
Union's all about."

PROTESTS
From Page 1A
Scales ended her speech by
promising "physical actions"
against the University and
increasing activism if negotia-
tions are not concluded within
the given timeframe.
In a letter delivered to Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man and the University's Board
of Regents late Monday, the BSU
clarified that if the University
does not comply with their seven
demands, they will be forced to
increase "physical activism for
social progress" on campus.
The deadline given at the pro-
test is Jan. 27 by 5 p.m.
The protest comes on the
heels of the University's newly-
announced plan of action to
combat diversity issues on cam-
pus. An e-mail Thursday night
from Provost Martha Pollack
outlined new initiatives includ-
ing improvements to the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center and the
creation of a new leadership posi-
tion to help combat low minority
recruitment.
"This commitment is long-
standing and fundamental to
who we are as an institution,"
Pollack wrote. "And yet, there
are times we have not lived up to
our highest aspirations."
However, LSA senior Tyrell

great job and other universities
around the country are quickly
adapting as well."
Many of the event sponsors
used MHacks as a venue to
recruit future talent to their
companies. The companies
observed participants solve
problems and present solutions
in real time, Hurd said.
"You have to go actually
apply what you've learned in a
real-world setting, solve unex-
pected problems, encounter
new obstacles that you didn't
see coming and work in a team
more often, which is absolutely
essential to the real world," he
said.

Collier, BSU speaker, said
Thursday that the BSU was not
consulted before the announce-
ment, even though it explicitly
acknowledged the #BBUM cam-
paign. The movement, which
was led by the BSU in November,
received national media atten-
tion and shed light on the experi-
ences of many Black students on
campus.
The list of demands was sub-
sequently tweeted under the
trending BBUM hashtag:
- We demand the University to
give us an equal opportunity to
implement change. The change
that complete restoration of the
BSU's purchasing power through
an increased budget would
obtain.
- We demand the Univer-
sity available housing on central
campus for those of lower socio-
economic status at a rate that
students can 2 ._ 1 to be a part
of university life, ant not just on
the periphery.
- We demand for an oppor-
tunity to congregate and share
our experiences ir a new Trotter
(Multicultural Center) located
on central campus.
- We demand an opportunity
to educate and be educated about
America's historical treatment
and marginalization of colored
groups through race and ethnic-
ity requirements throughout all
schools and colleges within the
University.
This year's event was held
in the Qube - the Quicken
Loans headquarters. Dan Gil-
bert, founder and chairman of
Quicken Loans, worked closely
with the organizers to promote
the city's resurgence, a mission
he supports through Oppor-
tunity Detroit, a subsidiary of
Quicken Loans that works on a
variety of restoration and revi-
talization projects around the
city.
Business and LSA junior
Lucy Zhao, one of the event's
coordinators, said Detroit was
a logical choice for the event,
given the University's close ties
to the city.
"Detroit is a big part of the
University of Michigan iden-
tity and the Ann Arbor com-
munity and we thought it was
a great opportunity to show

- We demand the equal oppor-
tunity to succeed with emer-
gency scholarships for black
students in need of financial sup-
port, without the mental anxiety
of not being able to focus on and
afford the University's academic
life.
- We demand for increased
exposure of all documents
within the Bentley (Historical)
Library. There should be trans-
parency about the University
and its past dealings with race
relations.
- We demand an increase in
black representation on this
campus equal to 10 percent.
"The University should
invest in our well-being because
we invest in it," Scales said.
"Because after all the struggle
of being brown and Black on this
campus, in the end, we still bleed
the same colors as everyone else
- maize and blue."
The BSU protestors quickly
dispersed after Scales conclud-
ed her remarks. The majority of
attendees from Belafonte's lec-
ture left the building after the
protest was over.
LSA sophomore Alexis Farm-
er, a student who observed the
protest, was skeptical that action
will be taken in seven days.
"Realistically, some of the
demands were stated in the first
movement," Farmer said. "That
was over 30 years ago and we are
still having the same problems."
off the city," Zhao said. "A lot
of the time, people around the
country only hear of Detroit as
dangerous and bankrupt - they
only hear bad news about it."
Zhao said the combination
of the Martin Luther King,
Jr. weekend and Detroit Auto
Show seemed like the oppor-
tune moment to reverse some
of the public misconceptions
regarding the city.
"The great thing about an
event like MHacks is that we
can bring 1,200 real talented,
top engineers from around the
country and world to this loca-
tion," Zhao said. "It's a great
opportunity to show off the
entrepreneurial renaissance
that's happening in Detroit -
tons of startups, venture capital
and new investments - that a
lot of people don't know about."

LSA senior Ravon Alford,
another student who observed
the protest, was more optimistic.
"I think it is possible because
if BBUM can receive national
recognition within a few hours
in one day. Seven days is enough
time for this video that they
made to just take the media by
storm and for it to be taken to
the administrators of this uni-
versity," Alford said. "We need
more diversity on campus to
make this an enjoyable experi-
ence for all students of all racial
backgrounds."
A second protest by BAMN,
an advocacy group that protest
in favor of affirmative action
policies, began shortly after the
BBUM rally. The organization
is part of a national group with
chapters on college campuses
and the country.
Students held signs and chant-
ed down South State Street, up
North University Avenue and
through to the Hill neighbor-
hood. The event came after Fri-
day's protest in the Diag, which
called for similar actions.
The Supreme Court heard
oral arguments for Schuette v.
Coalition to Defend Affirma-
tive Action in October. The case
questions the legality of Propos-
al 2, a 2006 amendment to the
Michigan State Constitution that
banned the consideration of race
in the college admissions pro-
cess, among other factors.

time, King told him, "I've come
to the realization that I think we

the painful ending, King said to
Belafonte that they must become

He continued King's metaphor

become firemen and save the
nation from being consumed by
its problems of poverty, racism
and sexism was for people to take
responsibility for their actions
and the world around them.
"We can ignore our respon-

I think there's still time for us

to sit and seriously take stock of
what's going on," Belafonte said.
"Because this inclement weather
we are experiencing, it's our fault,
let no one tell you differently. It is
up to us to find the moral center."'
LSA sophomore Queosha Jones
said she was glad she could learn

Judge resigns after
emails reveal racist
bias in court issues

Hundreds of racist
messages prompt
investigation into
past rulings
HELENA, Mont. (AP) - A
former Montana judge who was
investigated for forwarding a
racist email involving President
Barack Obama sent hundreds of
other inappropriate messages
from his federal email account,
according to the findings of a
judicial review panel released
Friday.
Former U.S. District Judge
Richard Cebull sent emails to
personal and professional con-
tacts that showed disdain for
blacks, Indians, Hispanics,
women, certain religious faiths,
liberal political leaders, and
some emails contained inappro-
priate jokes about sexual ori-
entation, the Judicial Council
of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals found.
Many of the emails also relat-
ed to pending issues that could
have come before Cebull's court,
such as immigration, gun con-
trol, civil rights, health care and
environmental issues, the coun-
cil found in its March 15, 2013,
order.
The investigation looked at
four years of Cebull's personal
correspondence sent from his
official email account. Investiga-
tors also reviewed his past cases
and interviewed witnesses.
The investigation found no
evidence of bias in Cebull's rul-
ings or sentences, and the wit-
nesses generally regarded him as
a "good and honest trial lawyer,
and an esteemed trial judge,"
according to the report.
The 9th Circuit council issued
Cebull a public reprimand;
ordered no new cases be assigned
to him for 180 days; ordered him
to complete training on judicial
ethics, racial awareness and
elimination of bias; and ordered
him to issue a second public
apology that would acknowledge
"the breadth of his behavior."
The panel said impeachment

was not warranted because
Cebull did not violate federal or
state law, though two of the judg-
es on the council said they would
have asked for his resignation.
But none of the sanctions took
effect and the findings did not
become public until Friday on
the order of a national judicial
review panel.
Cebull announced his resigna-
tion March 29, two weeks after
the judicial council issued its
order.
After Cebull retired May 3,
the 9th Circuit council vacated
its previous order and wrote a
new one calling the complaints
against Cebull "moot" because
of his retirement.
The panel also omitted details
from the original unpublished
order about the other emails
Cebull had sent.
That prompted Judge Theo-
dore McKee, the chief judge
of the 3rd U.S. Circuit, to file a
petition with the national Judi-
cial Conference's Committee on
Judicial Conduct and Disability,
asking the committee to review
the council's work and publish
the original March 15 order.
Judge McKee argued that the
9th Circuit council's subsequent
rulings inappropriately con-
cealed its original findings.
The 9th Circuit Council told
the national review panel in
response that it sought only
to disclose enough about the
investigation to ensure the pub-
lic knows the matter was taken
seriously, and it did not intend to
publish the original order.
The national committee ruled
that Cebull's retirement only
affected the sanctions, but the
factual findings and legal con-
clusions of the investigation
must still be published.
"The imperative of transpar-
ency of the complaint process
compels publication of orders
finding judicial misconduct," the
national judicial panel wrote in
its decision.
A phone number listed under
Cebull's name was disconnected
Friday, and an after-hours phone
call to the U.S. District Court in
Billings went unanswered.

Elder Cal Murrell reacts to a speaker during the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday commemorative service at Ebenezer Baptist Church Monday in Atlanta. The
service at the church where King preached featured prayers, songs, music and speakers.
Civil rights leaders remember MLK
legvacy, discuss work left to be done

National movement
seeks to expand
on half century of
achievements
ATLANTA (AP) - As the
nation remembered and reflected
Monday on the legacy of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., leaders
and everyday Americans talked
about how far the country has
come in the past 50 years and
how much more is to be done.
At Ebenezer Baptist Church
in King's hometown of Atlanta,
civil rights leaders and mem-
bers of King's own family spoke
about poverty, violence, health
care and voting rights, all themes
from the civil rights struggle that
still resonate to this day.
"There is much work that we
must do," King's daughter Ber-
nice King said. "Are we afraid,
or are we truly committed to the
work that must be done?"

The event in Atlanta featured
music, songs and choirs and was
one of many celebrations, march-
es, parades and community ser-
vice projects held Monday across
the nation to honor the slain civil
rights leader. It was about 50
years ago today that King had
just appeared on the cover of
Time magazine as its Man of the
Year, and the nation was on the
cusp of passing the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. King would win the
Nobel Peace Prize later that year.
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said
not many states could boast a
native son that merited a national
holiday. "But we Georgians can,"
he told the audience.
Deal said this year he would
work with state legislators to find
a way to honor King at the Geor-
gia Capitol, which drew a stand-
ing ovation. He did not give any
specifics, but civil rights leaders
have suggested a statue. The only
current tribute to King at the
state Capitol is a portrait inside
the Statehouse.

"I think that more than just
saying kind thoughts about him
we ought to take action our-
selves," said Deal, a Republican.
"That's how we embed truth into
our words. I think it's time for
Georgia's leaders to follow in Dr.
King's footsteps and take action,
too."
In the fall, a statue of 19th cen-
tury white supremacist politician
and newspaperman Tom Watson
was removed from the Capitol.
Deal also touched on criminal
justice reforms his administra-
tion has tried to make, including
drug and mental health courts,
saying too many people are not
being rehabilitated in prisons.
"Let's build a monument, but
the monument should inspire us
to build a better world," said the
Atlanta event's keynote speaker,
the Rev. Raphael Warnock. He
also said the growing dispari-
ties in income, opportunity and
health care are indications of a
continuing struggle for equality
decades after King's death.

The event closed with the
choir singing "We Shall Over-
come," with visitors singing
verses in Spanish, Hebrew and
Italian as audience members
joined hands and swayed in uni-
son.
President Barack Obama hon-
ored King's legacy of service by
helping a soup kitchen prepare
its daily meals. Obama took his
wife, Michelle, and daughters
Malia and Sasha to DC Central
Kitchen, which is a few minutes
away from the White House.
New York City's new Mayor
Bill de Blasio marked the day by
talking about economic inequal-
ity, saying it was "closing doors
for hard-working people in this
city and all over this country."
"We have a city sadly divided
between those with opportunity,
with the means to fully partake
of that opportunity, and those
whose dreams of a better life are
being deferred again and again,"
he told an audience at the Brook-
lyn Academy of Music.

Israel-Palestine
conflict to be
another important
topic in Davos
DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -
Talks over the future of Syria
and Iran will occur on the side-
lines of the annual gathering for
political and financial elites in
the Swiss ski resort of Davos, the
founder of the World Economic
Forum said Monday.
Klaus Schwab said in an inter-
view with the Associated Press
that there will be crossover
between the forum's 2,500 par-
ticipants and the officials from
the U.S., Russia and close to 40
other countries that are attend-
ing the start of the Syria peace
conference several hours away in
Montreux, Switzerland.
Syria's main, Western-backed
opposition group agreed Monday
to attend this week's peace con-
ference only after threatening to
sit it out because of a last-minute
U.N. invitation for Iran to join in.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon was forced to withdraw
the invitation Monday because
the Syrian National Coalition
had objected to Iran's partici-
pation because it keeps "troops
and militias" in Syria and failed
to endorse a 2012 U.N.-brokered
roadmap to establish a transi-
tional government.
But Iran will still be able to
interact at Davos with many of
the key players trying to end Syr-
ia's devastating civil war.
"Here you have some of the
true leaders with the influ-
ence on the region, so I am sure
the results will have an impact

Iran, Syria to enter
discussion at World
Economic Forum

on our own discussions," said
Schwah, a German-horn econo-
mist and engineer who founded
the Davos forum in 1971. Since
then, the five-day gathering,
which attracts heads of state,
royalty and top executives, has
grown into a massive network-
ing event - what some consider
speed-dating for the political
and corporate elites.
Iranian leaders' presence
at Davos also coincides with
the implementation of the deal
agreed- to in Geneva that is
intended to rein in their nuclear
program in exchange for easing
sanctions, enabling Iran to pur-
sue new business opportunities
particularly in its oil and gas sec-
tor.
But Schwab said it would be
too early for Iranian President
Hassan Rouhani and his foreign
minister, Javad Zarif, to start
negotiating new investments
while at the forum. First, they
need to boost international trust
that Iran will respect the terms
of their nuclear deal.
"We have to create the real-
ity which allows confidence
between the different parties,
and only in the next phase you
can really talk about business,"
Schwab said of the Iranians'
prospects for new oil, gas and
other business deals.
Discussions on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict are also
expected at the Davos forum,
with Israel's Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, President
Shimon Peres and Justice Minis-
ter Tzipi Livni all attending. The
flagging Mideast peace process
is a priority for U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry, who is expect-
ed in Davos for most of the event,
which lasts through Saturday.

"YOU'RE NOT DON CHEADLEH"
Bell shines in lukewarm
'House of Lies' premiere

Streep's heavyhanded
approach sinks star-
laden 'August'
By NATALIE GADBOIS
SeniorArts Editor
There is a moment (one of
many), when "August: Osage
County" goes completely over the
edge of sanity.
You haven't
lived until you
see Julia Rob- August:
erts scream- Osage County
ing at Meryl
Streep to, Michigan Theater
"Eat the fish, The Weinstein
bitch." Much
like the rest ompany
of "August,"
the moment is
fraught with aggression and sad-
ness; it is also hilariously over-
wrought and over-the-top. The
film, adapted from Tracy Letts'
award-winning play, is just too
much: too many famous actors,
too many weaving plot lines, too
many screaming confrontations.
The film doesn't boil over so much
as it intermittently explodes, cre-
ating a mess that in the end is just
too much to clean up.
Streep embodies Violet
Weston, the drug-addled, vindic-
tive matriarchofanold Oklahoma
family. Violet is not a person so
much as a force; Streep pulls out
every textbook acting technique,
with her warbled voice, exagger-

ated movements and faux inten-
sity. After her alcoholic husband
goes missing, her three daughters
and their significant others come
to Osage County to console her.
The stars shuffle in like cattle -
Roberts as her embittered daugh-
ter, Barb, Benedict Cumberbatch
as the milky cousin, Dermot Mul-
roney asa sleazyboyfriend, Ewan
Macgregor as Barb's dandyish
ex-husband. There is a lot of com-
mitment to the roles - assumed
accents, pronounced physical
ticks - but this exuberant over-
acting turns the characters into
caricatures, especially as the film
continues and the story become
stranger and sadder.
What works best are the small-
er moments: sweet conversations
between estranged sisters, or the
simple intimacies of two star-
crossed lovers. In adaptinganepic
play into a two-hour movie, Letts
tries to condense rather than cut,
which throws off the film's pac-
ing. The plot is overstuffed and
most of the meaning is swept
away in the theatrics of the acting.
Julianne Nicholson ("Masters
of Sex") is shyly resilient as Ivy,
the only sister who stayed behind
to take care of their unrelenting
mother. She poignantly performs
the everyday duties while every-
one else is too busy arguing to
remember; there is a powerful
scene in which she is alone in the
kitchen, washing dishes, while
her family gossips about her on
the porch. It's a shame that as the
story goes on, her character is sac-

rificed to the craziness, as Ivy was
the only real person grounding
the brazen story.
More than anything else, the
film succeeds in establishing
exactly what Osage County is. It
is only through the ugly desola-
tion of the Great Plains that we
can begin to understand why this
family is so warped, and direc-
tor John Wells ("The Company
Men") flawlessly cuts between
family fights and empty sun-
tinged fields.
And the house. Much like in an
old-fashioned English novel, the
house is everything: a once stately
home reduced to dilapidation. It's
where the family reunites, but is
haunted by a dense past. Violet
ensconces herself in the home for
years, and the way it is designed
ensures that you can nearly smell
the musty loneliness. In a sense,
the film acts like a play, plac-
ing extreme value in the setting.
The house also serves to isolate
this family even more than they
already have been, creating a
microenvironment separate from
much of the rest of the world.
What it may lack in organiza-
tion, "August: Osage County"
makes up for in pure earnestness.
The cast is intensely committed,
the screenplay lovingly adapted -
the film is a mess notbecause they
didn't try, but because they tried
too hard. Much like the Weston
family, "August" focuses so much
on painful introspection that it
forgets how to live. It forgets how
to be normal

In the season two finale, all

TV friend groups that everyone
wishes they were a part of; the
"Girls" gang is the group every-
one wishes they weren't. In season
three of "Girls," Lena Dunham
is intent on letting us know that
she knows we don't like her char-

When people talk about
"Archer" decades from now,
the season five premiere will
be remem-
bered as a
major turn-
ing point in Archer
the show's
life. The Mondaysat10p.m.
premiere FX
did some-
thing incred-
ibly risky: it
threw away the show's entire
premise and essentially reset it.
Twists this drastic are uncom-
mon and can sometimes go very
wrong. Most shows, especially
comedies, have the tendency
to repeat the same story lines,
keeping one general model
and safely manipulating it just
enough to keep the viewers
happy. With this episode, how-
ever, "Archer" does everything
but raise a giant middle finger
to traditional sitcom tropes by
proving it doesn't need to be
repetitive. Whether creator
Adam Reed and his writers
were actually out of ideas for
spy stories or they just wanted
to do something new, this
reboot serves as a surprising
reinvigoration of the show.
For four seasons, "Archer"
followed the misadventures of
a group of spies who do espio-
nage work for a fictional agen-
cy, the International Secret
Intelligence Service, or ISIS.
In the season five premiere,
it's revealed that all of the
work that was done through-
out the series was, in fact, ille-
gal when the FBI comes in and
arrests everyone involved. As
a result, ISIS is shut down and
those who worked there land
themselves another job: selling
cocaine.

13.7 points and 5.7
assists per game.
UBURN HILLS,
Mich. - It all felt right
because it was, from
the fans to the introduction to
the perfor-
mance.
The

scene was
perfect -
Trey Burke
smiling,
signing EVERETT
autographs
and shouting COOK
"Go Blue"
to the
hundreds of fans who got to
the Palace of Auburn Hills
more than two hours before
the game started. He said that
being back in Detroit made
him feel like he was playing for
Michigan again, like he was
about to go on the court to play
VCU in the second round of the
2013 NCAA Tournament.
Everything was in place,
except for the jersey he was
wearing.
The NBA's Pistons had a
chance to make this scene play
out 41 times a year, a chance to
draft Burke and make sure the
state's prodigal son didn't begin
his pro career somewhere else,
but they passed. They let one
of the best players in Michigan
basketball history - its first
Player of the Year since 1966
and its only Naismith Award
Winper - slide down to the
Minnesota Timberwolves, who
then traded him to the Utah
Jazz for the 14th pick.
The selection felt like a
surprise to most, but it wasn't
for Burke and his family.

feeling passed pretty quickly
when he realized the situation
in Utah.
The Jazz are a young,
talented team without
expectations to win right away
- he has a chance to grow
without initial pressure. Plus,
his apartment in Utah is a mile
from the stadium and provides
a great view of the mountains
from the massive windows in
his bedroom.
"It came across my mind,
obviously with (the Pistons)
having the eighth pick," Trey
said Friday. "I kinda thought
they would take me, but they
didn't. Life moved on. I'm up
here and I feel like I'm in a good
position. Having a lot of fun."
When Trey was entering his
freshman year at Michigan,
Benji told him he had to make
it his team from the first open
gym on. He couldn't wait until
October to become a leader.
After that open gym, an
assistant coach called Benji and
told him that's exactly what
Trey did. Senior captain Stu
Douglass finished the session
and told the coaches, "That kid
has to start at the '1.' "
The Pistons have all the
talent in the world, All-Stars
rubbing elbows with All-
Stars, but there's a lack of
cohesiveness. It's almost like
they've never really practiced
together before.
Something, likea player who
at age 18 convinced a senior that
he should be running the show,

Former Michigan point guard Trey Burke could have been drafted by the Detroit Pistons. Instead, he's receiving national attention as a member of the Utah Jazz.

Joe Dumars didn't want him,"
said Benji Burke, Trey's father
and agent, in an interview with
the Daily on Friday. "From what
I heard the night before, they
didn't want to have a rookie
running the team. They wanted
to win now. Minnesota didn't
have any interest at all, they just
did it because they wanted the
picks that the Jazz had. I just
really think that Joe Dumars
didn't want to wait two or three
years for Trey to mature."
For many reasons - actually,
for every reason - passing on
Burke is looking like a bigger
mistake for the Pistons every
time the young point guard
plays. It couldn't have been
clearer on Friday night, when
Burke and the Jazz played the
Pistons in the Palace.

There seemed to be more

Michigan fans swarm Palace to see rookie sensation

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -
Praveen Manyam's son Arjun,
still in the formative period of his
sports fanhood, wore a Michigan
jersey to the Detroit Pistons
game Friday night, though
calling it a Detroit Pistons game
just wouldn't be right. It was
the Trey Burke game on Trey
Burke Celebration Day. It felt
like it could've been a state-
recognized holiday.
An usher tossed Arjun a hand
towel, and he caught it, a little
confused.
"That's Trey's towel," the
usher explained, and the kid
beamed from ear to ear. Arjun
had gotten into basketball in the
last two years - the time since
Burke arrived in Ann Arbor. But
Arjun doesn't care for the NBA.
He came to see his favorite
Michigan player.
In pregame introductions,
Burke got the loudest ovation
of all 10 starters as an opposing
player. The seats were filled
at the Palace at Auburn Hills
with a melange of Pistons and
Wolverines jerseys.
An hour and a half before
the game started, Burke signed
autographs on jerseys and
high-definition photos for fans
waiting by the tunnel. An hour
after the game, a line formed
the length of the court on the
sideline and veered up the
stairs in the lower bowl so that
fans might just get the chance
to take a picture with Burke
and say hello.
Waiting in that line was
Alex Groffsky. A Kalamazoo
College student, she followed
football for a while, but got
into basketball when Burke
began at Michigan.
She was at the game to see
one person and one person only.
Then there was Jake Bouren.
He came to the Palace in his
Utah Jazz Burke jersey, signed
by Trey himself before the
game. His father Mike bought
the tickets for the game a month
ago when it was clear that Burke
would be healthy after missing

the first few weeks of the season
with a fractured index finger.
Jake used to be a Pistons fan,
but is no longer.
"He's not a Pistons fan
because they passed on Trey

For the 21-year-old, this erind

"College prepares you, but the
amount of traveling, the amount
of games - it's like times two,"
Burke said. "You just have to be
ready mentally. I think that's the
biggest thing."

Burke has looked more like the

and six assists and is shooting

length of the Michigan regular

the rookie is unto the challenge.

hold everyone back so Burke
had to run onto the court by his
lonesome.
When the third quarter came
around, aggressive Trey took
over. He scored seven points
and recorded five assists in the
quarter on his way to a double-
double, finishing with 20 points
and 12 assists.
The Pistons were blown out
by 21 points, yet the fans got
what they paid for. Manyam,
Groffsky and Bouren all got
their money's worth.
In a battle of sub-.500
teams, the night was a chance
for Michigan, the region and
not just the university, to pay
tribute to the guy who made
basketball electric in the state
the past two years.
"I'm not even gonna lie, I
came out a little excited," Burke
said. "It was important for me to
just get comfortable out there.
Try not to really get distracted
by all the fans, signing things
before the game, things like
that. Just play basketball."
Just playing basketball is
what got Burke to this point,
and it's what got Groffsky to
the point she was at around
10:30 p.m. The Jazz team bus
was all loaded up and ready to
go, and Burke was walking up
the stairs in the lower bowl of
the Palace. He tried to please
his supporters by posing for
pictures, but he also didn't
want to hold up his team.
Groffsky joined the crowd
that swarmed Burke as he
stalked up the stairs. The
superstar was moving on to the
next step, the next challenge, as

Youth, offense key to success

crouched low on his sideline,
watching the Michigan women's
basketball team's offense go
to work. He focused on every
movement on the floor, mentally
willing a needed defensive stop
with the Fighting Illini trailing
late in Saturday's game.
Then he

Michigan
sophomore MAX
guard Madi-
son Ristovski COHEN
had just hit a
3-pointer to
give the Wolverines a 12-point
lead, and Bollant watched on. He
stared for a matter of moments
then turned around, muttered
something to his assistants and
beckoned for another player to
come off the bench.
Michigan's offense has had
a tendency to elicit this sort of
reaction from opposing coaches
this season. If there is a surefire
way to stop these Wolverines,
Big Ten coaches are still
searching for it.
That's because Michigan's
offense works like a tag-team
schoolyard fight. You can stop
one player, but then you have
to stop another who will step in
and produce.
Going into the season, the
Wolverines' youth made the
team irrelevant, a non-factor
in a Big Ten conference fraught
with experienced stars. Their
returning leading scorer, junior
guard Nicole Elmblad, averaged
just over four points per game.
Now, more than halfway
through the regular season,
Michigan's biggest weakness
has turned into one of its big-
gest strengths.
Maybe the solution is to hold

goal in the first half. Nice try,
but even as Illinois managed to
pull off the feat, it still trailed by
four entering the half.
If an opponent can stop
Smith from scoring for a half,
Michigan doesn't have to worry.
Freshman guard Siera Thomp-

blows instead, delivering four
jabs to the abdomen in the form
of 3-pointers as she did in the
first half against the Fighting

3-pointers on the team - and
the Wolverines have seven

players that can give opposing
coaches headaches.
Meanwhile, Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico had
whatever the opposite of a
headache is after her team
finished off Illinois. She gushed
about her team's performance,
thrilled with her team's start to
conference play.
"They have great chemistry,
they are so unselfish, they buy
into working hard, and I think
they're so naive," Barnes Arico
said. "They just go out and play."
Barnes Arico spoke with an
ear-to-ear
smile, making

naive." it is.
"It isn't like,
'Oh, I'm play-
ing Michigan
State,' or 'Oh, I'm playing Illi-
nois,' " Barnes Arico said. "They
play the same way all the time,
and they believe every time they
go outon the court they're going
to have an opportunity to win."
The fact that these play-
ers haven't scored more than a
smattering of points at the col-
legiate level helps Michigan

on each possession. It doesn't
matter to the Wolverines who
scores, as long as the possession
ends with the ball funneling its
way down the basket.
This complete lack of selfish-
ness rears its head each game as
Michigan lasers the ball around
the perimeter looking for the
best shot. The Wolverines weave
the ball inside and outside, until
the optimal look arises.
The formula isn't foolproof,
but nobody expected it to be.
A slow start against Michigan
State turned out to be costly, but
the versatile offense appeared
late in the first half, giving
Michigan a fighting chance in
its lone Big Ten loss up until the
final moments of the game.
After Saturday's win, Barnes
Arico broke out in joyous
laughter when asked if she
expected her team to have this
much success.
"Oh my goodness, no," Barnes
Arico said. "But knock on some
serious wood. You know what?
It's the kids. They are just
unbelievable."
It's unbelievable that the
Wolverines' offense has trans-
formed the-team from probable
cellar dweller to very possible
NCAA Tournament team. If any-
one thought this could've hap-
pened before the season, they
would've been naive.

From Page 1B
top teams assert themselves
by winning a tournament-style
championship.
But instead of a statement,
there was a one-possession loss
to Charlotte. Then there was
a lead lost down the stretch
against the Wildcats.
After that, they'd have to
take on every challenge minus
McGary. The early returns in
Big Ten play were inconclusive
despite the 4-0 start. They
picked up some important
wins, but nothing against high-
caliber teams.
Appropriately, the line for the
game was Wisconsin by eight.
But all of a sudden, Michigan
found itself up 60-45 with ten
minutes left on Saturday. Up
13 with eight minutes to play?
They still had it.
Until they didn't. Four
minutes and a 10-0 Badgers
run turned the Wolverines'
chances of winning from very
likely to very much in doubt.
Michigan's offensive strategy

had become to keep shooting
from deep and pray that
enough of them went down so
that the lead didn't get away.
The window that had some-
how been pried so far open
had gotten greased up and was
falling fast. When else would
Michigan be in such good posi-
tion to grab a top-five road win?
"Any time you can wipe down
a lead like that and get it to one?
I'd do backflips if I could still
do them," said Wisconsin coach
Bo Ryan.
It would have been a full 15
years since Michigan had last
won in Madison.
"I thought when they made
that run, I saw a couple of the
heads go down," Beilein said.
"And they needed to pick it up.
We had to challenge them to
say, 'We're going to win this
game, and we're going to win
the game by being aggressive.
And if you're afraid to shoot it,
you're afraid to take it at them,
then get out of the game.'
"And nobody checked out."
Despite missing five of his
last six shots, Stauskas kept
shooting. With the lead down

to one, he hit a step-back
3-pointer, the dagger.
Stauskas was the player who
wouldn't be denied from a team
that seemed destined to be
denied and has been all season.
As Wisconsin fouled to prolong
the game in the final minute,
Stauskas sprinted to the ball
each time and defied the double
team so that he could take the
foul shots. He made all six. And
so they won.
The Badgers haven't just
been more skilled than
Michigan over the years,
they've been Stronger. They
haven't just been unhealthy for
Michigan, they've been Toxic.
And heading into Saturday, it
seemed that a win against Wis-
consin - and a statement to the
college basketball world that
Michigan has something great
to offer this year - wouldn't
come 'Till The World Ends.
But afterward, it was time to
party like it was 1999.

One by one, Minnesota
wrestlers looked ready and able
to do just that, winning three
straight matches by a combined
score of 41-13 and setting up the
deciding heavyweight matchup
between Coon and Nelson.
"We needed a moment like
this," McFarland said. "We keep
hammering this home: If you go
out and believe in yourself and
compete and your effort is there
every time, good things are
going to happen."

Hundreds travel to
watch Coon
By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Freshman Adam Coon stared
at his feet as he paced the side
of the gym just moments before
his match Sunday afternoon. The
top-two heavyweight wrestlers
in the nation were about to clash,
and Coon had some special fans
contributing to the raucous
atmosphere at Cliff Keen Arena.
Scores of supporters from
Coon's hometown of Fowlerville,
Mich., made the 45-minute trip
south on US-23 to cheer on their
top-ranked hometown product.
Fowlerville has a population
of just under 3,000, and around
200 of them made the journey
to watch their hometown hero
compete on one of the biggest
stages the sport has to offer.
In a crowd that one would
expect to comprise almost

entirely maize and blue there
was another color dominating
the stands: purple. That's
Fowlerville's school color, and
there was enough of a presence in
the building to add a significant
hue to the near-sellout.
The Fowlerville contingency
contributed to a final attendance
that rested at 1,354 and helped
inspire what multiple Michigan
officials called one of the best
wrestling atmospheres in years.
Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 7-2
overall) was leading the match
16-3 heading into the 174-pound
weight class, but things took
a turn for the worse for the
Wolverines, and they led just
16-14 heading into the final match
of the evening: heavyweight.
Coon and his opponent,
Minnesota fifth-year senior
Tony Nelson, were pacing their
sidelines for minutes as the
previous weight class came to a
conclusion and the time finally
came to decide the dual.
"I was really focused, and then
saw all the purple and thought.

'Wow, there's a lot of people
supporting me,"' Coon said. "It
threw my focus a little, which
was good. I was getting a little too
keyed up, so it helped me to get
a little relaxed and realize that
there was a bunch of hometown
support here."
As Coon took the mat the
crowd cried "Coooon," and the
match began. The match ended
up being a low-scoring one, and
it eventually wound up in a third
overtime period tied, 2-2.
By that point, the anxiety in
the crowd was palpable. Coon
sensed it and began to take more
and more chances, eventually
landing a two-point takedown to
win both the match and the dual
for the Wolverines.
"The place erupted," said
Michigan coach Joe McFarland.
"I couldn't hear myself think."
For the Fowlerville residents,
their love for Coon runs deeper
than his on-the-mat success.
"He's the first high-profile
wrestler to come out from
Fowlerville in a while," Burma
said. "It's given the area someone
to stand behind and rally for.
It creates a lot of talk in the
restaurants and barber shops and
the schools all mention when he's
going to be wrestling."
According to Fowlerville
residents, whenever Michigan has
some time off, Coon is back home
working with the wrestling youth
of Livingston County.
"Ithascertainlyhelpedthenext
generation of wrestlers, especially
the middle schoolers," said trip
coordinator Mindy Burma. "He's
quite an idol to them. Another
nice thing about Adam is that he
is very intelligent, so he talks to
them a lot about working hard on
their academics as well."
Coon is in his first year
of collegiate wrestling, and
is already one of the sport's
biggest stars. In the post-match
autograph session, Coon even had
to have his own table and line, but
to the visitors from Fowlerville
he was just another friend.

heavyweight wrestlers into
overtime. In the third round
of extra time, a failed attack by
Nelson was countered by Coon,
securing the triumph for the
Wolverines and improving the
freshman's collegiate record to
23-0, extending the mark for the
best start in program history.
"If you're a wrestling fan,
you couldn't ask for a better
finish," said Michigan coach
Joe McFarland. "The place
absolutely erupted at the end. I
couldn't even hear myselfthink."
The afternoon began with
an early bang as Michigan
freshman Conor Youtsey nearly
pinned Samuel Brancale just 40
seconds in and dominated the
first two rounds, Youtsey built
up an 11-2 lead before late-match
fatigue narrowed the margin of
victory to 12-6.
Despite surrendering the late
takedowns, the electric crowd
recognized the message: Sunday
belonged to the Wolverines.

The Michigan wrestling team seemed to havea stranglehold on Minnesota on Sunday, but a late Gophers comeback set up the decisive heavyweight competition.

MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD
Wolverines dominate in
non-scoring competition

n
m

Michigan sophomore CindyOfii took first place in the 60-meter hurdles, the 60-meter dash and the 200-meter dash.
M' ominates invitational

By DANNY VARGOVICK
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 13 Michigan
women's track and field team
accomplished exactly what
it wanted to in its second
non-scoring competition,
dominating the Red Simmons
Invitational, a meet named after
the program's first head coach.
"We wanted to get some good
marks," said Michigan coach
James Henry. "We wanted to get
some good starts. For everybody,
that was our first home meet,
so we wanted to post some
good marks, and I think we
accomplished that."
Michigan competed against
Bowling Green, Concordia,
Detroit Mercy, Eastern
Michigan, Marygrove, Notre
Dame and Siena Heights,
as well as some club team
members. The Wolverines, the
top-ranked team in the Big
Ten, had no trouble against
their unranked opponents.
Fifth-year senior Kiley Tobel
finished first in the pole vault
with a mark of 4.25 meters,
breaking her previous school
record of 4.22. Tobel's mark beat
the second-place finish by 0.60
meters as Michigan took first,
second and third in the event.
Tobel was relieved to break

her personal best and school
record again.
"Getting that mark out of the
way takes a lot of the pressure
off and gives me a little bit of
confidence going forward,"
Tobel said. "I always want to
set it higher and leave my mark
here, so just getting that done,
especially so early in the season
already, makes me happy and
makes me a little bit hungrier."
Henry certainly couldn't
be happier with the two-time
captain.
"If you looked for a Michi-
gan Wolverine, there would be
a picture of her, because she's
a great kid, great individual,
great student, great team per-
son and great athlete, and that's
what a Michigan Wolverine is,"
Henry said.
Sophomore Cindy Ofili was
the other key performer, tak-
ing first place in the 60-meter
hurdles, 60-meter dash and 200-
meter dash. Her time of 8.27
seconds in the hurdles beat Jade
Barber of Notre Dame by a mere
0.006 seconds, while her times
of 7.56 in the 60 and 24.45 in the
200 won by 0.7 seconds and 0.93
seconds, respectively.
Ofili's success was certainly
notunprecedented. She took first
place in the 60-meter hurdles
and dash last week at the Grand

Valley Open and found success
in the preliminaries Saturday as
well. Four of the eight qualifiers
for the hurdles were Wolverines,
and senior Erin Busbee joined
Ofili as qualifiers in both the
hurdles and dash.
Michigan's bread and but-
ter has been the mid-distance
races, and it dominated the mile,
taking the top four spots with
the top three breaking the five-
minute mark. Senior Megan
Weschler finished first with a
time of 4:54:50.
Freshman Jaimie Phelan
placed first in the 600-meter run
with a time of 1:34:76, and three
of her teammates finished fifth
through seventh in the event.
Freshman Erin Finn won the
3,000-meter run with a time of
9:15:82, with Wolverines also
taking third and fourth.
"We always can use youth
with our veterans, so we're
always excited about the young
kids coming in and being able to
contribute right away," Henry
said. "We will need that to be in
contention for Michigan State."
After a dominant performance
in the non-scoring portion of the
schedule, the Wolverineswillget
a well-deserved rest. Michigan
won't return to action until Feb.
1 in its first scoring meet against
Michigan State.

facility record.
"Whenever Jeff Porter and I
get a chance to race, it's always
fun," said Michigan senior
hurdler Herman Washington.
Washington placed third
in the 60-meter hurdles final
and said that it was a mediocre
performance by his standards.
Though Michigan finished the
meet with four personal bests
and five wins, the first meet of
any track season is usually less

While the Wolverines will
continue to evaluate their
performance throughout the
rest of January, the coach
explained that they need to
continue putting in work leading
up to the Big Ten championships
in late February.
"It's a beginning, not an end,"
Clayton said. "We just need
to keep moving in a positive
direction."
