high yield rate.
But the numbers remain incon-
sistent for Malaysia. In 2009, a total
of only four students enrolled in
the University from the country. No
students from Universiti Teknologi
Sara even applied.
A combination of small decreases
in the numbers of enrolled students
from other countries and a higher
yield rate of students accepted has
made students from these four coun-
tries, primarily Malaysia in 2008, a
majority of international students
enrolling in the University.
-According to Stanford University
Sociology Professor Mitchell Ste-
vens, one cause of the shift is that
American universities are going
abroad more often to find interna-
tional students not only for their
academic ability, but as an economic
strategy as well.
"The entire elite sector of U.S.
higher education is moving toward
rucruitment of greater numbers
of students from abroad," Stevens
wrote in an e-mail. "The reasons: tal-
ent and revenue."
Stevens, who specializes in the
organizational sociology of higher
education, academic accomplish-
ment and alternative schooling,said
that the appeal of international stu-
dents to universities in the United
States increases with the growing
ease of receiving higher education
abroad.
"Steadily decreasing real costs of
transportation and communication
make international study ever more
feasible for ever more students," Ste-
vens said via email, "and U.S. schools
remain high-prestige destinations
for people from all over the world."
The growing desire to bring in
more international students has
brought about an increase in recruit-
ment from American universities in
sigh schools abroad.
Sanders attributed much of the
recruitment work done internation-
ally to alumni who live abroad and
are looking to expand knowledge of
and interest in the University.
"We have alumni clubs that will
host events that will ask if they can
volunteer," Sanders said. "So we have
an alumni student recruiter net-
work."
Abdul said that while she has
heard of other colleges coming to her
high school in Malaysia, the Univer-
sity had yet to be one of them, and
that in her experience, the Univer-
sity of Michigan was not necessarily
a popular school choice for students
from Malaysia. Abdul said Pennsyl-
vania State University, Purdue Uni-
versity and Drake University were
popular choices among the students

she knows.
"Although U of M isn't as popular
in Malaysia," Abdul said in an email,
"knowing in the back of my mind that
I'm going to a good school, get a good
education and excel in my field of
study is all that I need."
Sanders said international stu-
dents are a vital part of the growing
global awareness on campus.
"In terms of thinking of the Uni-
versity as a whole it's a community.

so wanting to create an atmosphere
that fosters education, part of that is
about a global community."
Stevens said that the increase in
international students in American
universities will notbe fadingout any
time soon.
"We will only see more recruit-
ment of international students, and
more initiatives abroad by U.S. uni-
versities in the coming years," Ste-
vens said.

random student interview by will grundler

Welcome to the Random
Student Interview,
brief Q&A session in
which truth and beauty can be
found in the strangest of places.
Please state your name and class
standing for the record.
I'm Emily and I'm a sophomore.
Would you rather be stalked by a
T-rex or avelociraptor?
Oh, velociraptor.
Are you sure? The T-rex is actually
a scavenger.
But velociraptors can fly, right?
Those are birds. Moving on. Please
rank the following in terms of
importance to you, with one being
the least important and 10 being
the -
Ten? Oh my god.
One to five?
Yeah.

School, prayer, South America.
I'm going to give prayer number one.
I'm a very spiritual person. School's
a close second, so I'm going to have
to give that number two, and South
America -
Why is South America last?
To be honest I'm kind of apathetic
about it. I don't really know much
about it.
Don't you know the capital?
No. Wait, South America the conti-
nent?
Yes. I think it has a capital.
It does? Interesting.
Two trains are heading toward
each other - do you want a piece of
paper? This is kind of a math prob-
lem.
Oh, I'll try to do it in my head.
What major are y^u?
Neuroscience.

You might be able to get this then.
Two trains are heading toward
each other. One leaves Boston at 3
p.m. traveling at 70 mph while the
other leaves Philadelphia at 3:30
p.m. traveling at 50 mph. What
color are the Boston train conduc-
tor's eyes?
Green and hazel. My eyes are green
and hazel.
But you're not driving the train.
I thought I was the conductor!
I didn't say that. What's E.T. short
for?
Extra-terrestrial.
No, he's got little stumps for legs.
If a real-life sorting hat existed,
what social stereotype do you
think you would get sorted into?
Do you have examples?
Oh, sure. So say Hermione were to
go to the hat - instead of saying,


"Gryffindor!" the hat would say,
"Loser!" Something like that.
So like loser or nerd or jock. Okay, I'm
definitely not a jock. In high school
I did pom. I don't know if you know
what that is...I would say I'm a nerd,
but I'm still kind of friendly.
We're getting a little off track. In
what situation is it acceptable to
lie under oath?
If you're in a courtroom? I don't think
it's acceptable at all.
What if you were to get in trouble,
though, if you told the truth?
What kind of trouble?
Oh, fines.
I would have a guilty conscience.
Let's say life imprisonment.
Hm...if I couldn't get caught I would
tell a little white lie, or a fib, just to
twist the truth.
Understandable. If a spirit came
to you from the great beyond and
said, "Everything will be okay.
Don't worry. Existence is per-
manent," would you still do your
homework?
Yes.
What if the opposite was true?
Yes. I'd like to make the most of my
life here. I feel like our generation is
going to live until at least the early
nineties, don't you think?
I don't know. You're the neuro-
scientist. I guess what I'm try-
ing to say is, do we have anything
besides each other, and alcohol, to
keep us going?
I think it's important to believe that
there's some sort of higher power
governing something that's looking
out for us.
Words to live by. Lastly, what's
the most annoying thing about
small children?
I hate kids. Oh my god. I could go on
for hours.
Dolit.
Oh, they're just so stupid.
And needy.
And needy, like, clingy.
They can't even go to the bath-
room by themselves.
I know. It's very annoying. I know we
were all there at some point but -
There's really no excuse for it.
I agree.

HILES TO THE UNION

he University prides itself on
having a diverse student body,
featuring students from 120 dif-
ferent countries and all SO states. But
sitting in a lecture in Angell Hall or
walking through the Diag, nearly one
student out of every six is from a few
select high schools.
From 2004 to 2009, an average of
about 16 percent of the University's
freshman classes came from just 20
high schools, though more than 1,000
high schools have sent students to the
University each year during that time.
That percentage ranged from 13 to 19
percent through these years.
Officials from the University's Office
of Undergraduate Admissions told The
Michigan Daily in a series of inter-
views last year that the disproportion-
ate representation is not intentional.
"It's not by any design of ours that
these schools are 'the ones,' " said
Erica Sanders, director of recruitment
and operations in the office of Under-
graduate Admissions. "Our goal is that
we wish we have more schools where
there were students that come that are
having great experiences and more of
their colleagues feel like 'Gosh that
will be a great place for me as well.' "
Sanders said one of the key reasons
so many students come to the Univer-
sity from the same schools year after
year is because students who come
to the University from "feeder" high
schools portray the University in a
positive light in their hometowns.
"If a student enrolls in the Univer-
sity and has a good experience, when

they go on, whether it's home for the
holidays or once they graduate, if
they're pursuing the things they enjoy
and love, then it's natural that the peo-
ple in their community would then say,
'Gosh, she went to that school and she's
successful and she was able to find a
job. Look at her life; I want a similar
life. I think I'll apply to that school,''"
she said.
According to Sanders, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions is actively
working to break the pattern of dispro-
portionate representation from select
high schools. Every year, admissions
officials take a look at the schools from
which they don't receive many appli-
cations and ask what can be done to
attract more students the following
year.
"We don't just visit the schools
where we receive a lot of applications,"
Sanders said. "We also visit the schools
where we don't receive any appli-
cations to let them know about the
opportunities that are available."
These elevated enrollment patterns
of students from specific high schools
are also due in part to the University's
success in conveying to those schools
that a student is choosing to go the
University, not just settling to go there,
Sanders said.
IN-STATE VS. OUT-OF-STATE
Between 2004 and 2009, no less
than 13 of the top 20 schools with stu-
dents admitted to the University were
in Michigan, and most of those were

within an hour's drive of Ann Arbor.
Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor
has sent the most students to the Uni-
versity every year from 2004 to 2009.
In 2009, 154 students were accepted
from the high school and 110 students
matriculated, producing at 71-per-
cent yield rate - the rate of students
that enroll compared to the number
accepted. While the number of stu-
dents from Pioneer attending the Uni-
versity was in the triple digits in 2009,
schools like Genesee High School in
Genesee, Mich. Only had one student
apply to the University in the same
year.
The Office of Undergraduate Admis-
sions visits around 500 schools in the
state each year. It is often, accord-
ing to Sanders, the smaller townships
that are farther away from Ann Arbor
where admissions officials have a
harder time reaching out to prospec-
tive students.
Sanders said students from these
towns often come from smaller schools
with graduating classes of about SO
people, which could make attending
a 400-person lecture an intimidating
venture.
Though it's more likely for a student
from a larger high school to end up at
the University than a student from a
smaller one, Sanders said this isn't by
design. Rather, it's because bigger high
schools have larger pools of applica-
tions and, by extension, more qualified
students.
"As I'm reviewing (applications),
I'm basing my decision on the infor-
mation included

mendation for a
TTE D M AD E decision," Sand-
OL S IN 2009 ers said. "I don't
know when I'm
reviewing if this
is the 4th appli-
cant or the 14th
applicant (from
% $ Â°the school) as
I'm reviewing the
files, so there's
no quota or cap
on any particu-
lar high school in
terms of the num-
ber of students
we will admit."
"Feeder"
schools are often
the same schools
that admissions
officials believe

prepare students best to attend the
University, whether in the state of
Michigan or outside it. New Trier
High School, located in Winnetka, Ill.,
an affluent Chicago suburb, sent more
students to the University than any
other school outside the state of Michi-
gan in 2009, with 75 students accepted
from the high school and 29 of those
students matriculating.
Jim Conroy, chair of post-high
school counseling at New Trier High
School, said in an interview on Oct.
12 that he felt that a combination of
returning college students and alumni
in the area contributes to the number
of applicants from New Trier.
"I think a lot of it is the history of
family and alumni in the area that
went to U of M," he said. "U of M has
such a high profile in the community,
students keep applying."
Conroy added that he believes the
Chicago area holds one of the largest
University alumni populations.
"I think that's the case for a lot of
Midwestern schools, just because the
city is so big," he said.
Conroy said that one delegate from
the University Admissions Office
works with the area around New
Trier High School from year to year.
And while he commended the Office
of Admissions for their ongoing work
with his high school, he said the stu-
dents themselves are the best "sales-
people" for the University.
Schools like New Trier, Pioneer and
high schools in New York and Illinois -
especially preparatory schools - have
goals of preparing and sending their
students off to top colleges. Applicants
from these schools often take Advance
Placement courses and have what the
University considers to be challenging
high school curriculums.
When admissions officials see these
factors on a student's application, they
are likely to accept them, leading to a
situation where certain schools repeat-
edly have high numbers of students
accepted to the University, according
to Sanders.
"There are definitely schools that
have the right types of preparation,"
Sanders said.
But despite the same criteria for in-
state and out-of-state applicants, Sand-
ers said the University has a certain
dedication to the state of Michigan.
"The University has made a com-
mitment to the state," Sanders said.
"We make a commitment to make sure
we're really educating the state popu-
lation first, but quality is really what

rules the day."
Sanders said students applying to
the University from out of state are
often looking at schools within their
home state, as well as universities
around the country that offer a par-
ticular curriculum.
"They may be looking at a specific
academic area of interest, they may
be looking for a similar school to the
one they may be considering in their
home state," she said. "But what we do
know is consistently that the students
spend a fair amount of time looking at
the information we share about what
we offer and what we require in the
admissions process."
Sanders added that while the Uni-
versity commits itself to its home state,
being an in-state applicant doesn't make
acceptance any easier. The standards
remain the same for all applicants.
She said that out-of-state students
who apply tend to have more honors
and Advanced Placement classes in
their high schools, while many Michi-
gan students who apply to the Univer-
sity have more limited curriculums at
their high schools.
Still, Sanders said the students being
accepted to the University are the best
in their high schools, regardless of
whether they are from Michigan or
not.
Sanders also said that the admis-
sions process is need-blind, so that
admissions officers are unaware of how
much financial need will be required
for students before being accepted to
the University.
The University aims to keep a
two-thirds, one-third ratio between
in-state and out-of-state students,
respectively. And while that one third
of out-of-state students makes up a
minority on campus, the population of
students from around the world is even
smaller.
T H E INTERNATIONAL EFFECT
While ranked globally for its
academics, the University has a
surprisingly low number of interna-
tional students. From 2004 and 2009,
between 250 and 350 international
students enrolled as freshmen each
year, less than seven percent of the
freshmen class.
The small representation from other
countries on campus has grown more
homogenous in recent years as well.
The distribution of countries yielding
higher numbers of students has shifted
dramatically toward eastern countries
